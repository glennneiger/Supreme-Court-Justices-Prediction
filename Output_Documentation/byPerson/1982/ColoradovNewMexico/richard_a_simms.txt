mr.
richard
a.
simms
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
special
master's
report
in
this
case
was
filed
in
january
of
this
year,
and
since
then
it
has
not
gone
unnoticed.
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
the
community
of
western
water
attorneys,
as
well
as
water
administrators
in
the
west,
are
bewildered
by
the
master's
recommendations
and
are
apprehensive
about
the
outcome
of
this
case.
i
would
like
to
quote
briefly
from
the--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--i
agree,
that
is
the
important
thing.
but
i
think
it's
also
important
that
the
court
understands
what
people
in
the
west
feel
about
the
case.
i'd
like
to
quote
briefly
from
the
western
natural
resource
litigation
digest,
the
quarterly
publication
of
the
western
conference
of
attorneys
general.
in
january
1982,
the
court's
special
master
recommended
that
colorado
fuel
and
iron
steel
corporation
be
given
first
priority
on
the
vermejo
river
in
an
action
brought
by
the
state
of
colorado
for
the
apportionment
of
the
river
between
the
states
of
colorado
and
new
mexico.
for
the
past
100
years,
the
river
has
been
fully
appropriated
in
new
mexico.
the
decision
ignored
both
new
mexico's
historical
dependence
on
the
vermejo
and
their
traditional
guiding
principle
that
prior
appropriation
governs.
the
special
master's
new
test
balances
the
economic
efficiency
of
existing
uses
against
the
efficiency
of
proposed
uses.
in
this
case,
the
test
is
used
in
a
further
departure
from
previous
case
law
to
vary
the
priorities
such
that
existing
economies
based
upon
senior
uses
are
undermined.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
don't
know
who
wrote
it.
it
was
written--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--it
was
written
by
the
editorial
staff
of
the
digest
in
san
francisco.
i
gave
them
no
suggestions.
i
was
quite
surprised
to
find
it
myself.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
well,
it
was
written
by
the
editorial
staff
of
the
western
conference
of
attorneys
general.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
the
central
issues
are
three,
justice
burger.
i
think
the
special
master
started
with
a
manifest
misunderstanding
of
equitable
apportionment.
i
think
he
ignored
the
relevant
facts
in
this
case
and
attributed
legal
significance
to
irrelevant
facts.
and
with
respect
to
his
ultimate
finding
that
cf&i's
proposed
diversion
would
have
little
effect
on
new
mexico
users,
i
believe
that
is
not
a
finding
at
all
but
is
demonstrably
an
erroneous
conclusion
of
law.
i
think
the
real
irony
of
the
master's
report
lies
in
his
understanding
that...
and
i'm
quoting
him
from
page
21
of
the
report...
the
unique
circumstances
which
confronts
the
master
in
this
case
is
colorado's
failure
to
divert
water
and
put
it
to
beneficial
use
at
any
time
in
the
past.
new
mexico
has
applied
the
water
and
has
existing
economies
which
are
dependent
upon
that
water.
instead
of
applying,
the
rather
obvious
holdings
of
this
court
in
wyoming
versus
colorado
and
nebraska
versus
wyoming
and
in
arizona
versus
california,
the
master
instead
has
equated
the
cause
of
action
in
this
case
with
the
relief
sought.
the
way
he
puts
it
is
this,
and
i'll
quote
him
again...
simply
stated,
the
doctrine
says
that
each
state
is
equal
to
all
of
the
others,
and
as
quasi-sovereigns,
each
state
is
entitled
to
a
share
of
a
river
flowing
between
them.
we
think
that
the
master
started
with
the
view
that
each
state
is
entitled
to
a
portion
of
the
waters
of
an
interstate
stream
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
might
be.
this
is
best
illustrated
i
think
by
the
master's
treatment
of
the
first
equitable
apportionment
decision
handed
down
by
this
court
in
1906,
kansas
versus
colorado.
that
case,
very
unlike
the
case
before
this
court
today,
showed...
the
facts
in
that
case
showed
a
pattern
of
contemporaneous
development
in
both
states.
by
1883
in
kansas,
there
were
some
1,200,000
acres
of
irrigation
on
the
arkansas
in
kansas.
between
1884
and
1891,
there
had
developed
independently
under
the
law
or
prior
appropriation
in
colorado
some
300,100
acres
of
land.
that
situation
presented
the
classic
equitable
apportionment
case.
the
water
supply
became
insufficient
to
satisfy
the
simultaneous
growth
in
both
states,
and
there
appeared
a
conflict
in
the
social
and
economic
institutions
which
had
developed
independently.
there,
the
substantive
laws
of
each
state...
and
as
you'll
recall,
it
was
said
in
kansas
versus
colorado
that
there
is
no
federal
law
of
water
in
the
west;
each
state
has
a
right
to
develop
its
own
system
under
which
rights
to
the
use
of
water
might
be
protected...
each
state
had
done
so.
the
substantive
laws
in
kansas
versus
colorado
had
been
exercised
historically.
in
that
case
there
was
an
actual
conflict
between
existing
users
on
either
side
of
the
state
line.
because
in
kansas
they
have
the
doctrine
of
riparianism,
which
stands
for
the
proposition
that
water
should
be
maintained
in
the
river
and
let
down
the
river
undiminished,
and
on
colorado's
side
you
have
priority
of
appropriation,
a
doctrine
which
allows
water
to
be
diverted
from
the
river
and
taken
to
lands
not
riparian
to
the
river,
you
had
an
actual
collision
of
sovereigns
in
that
case.
also,
the
sovereign
interest
on
both
sides
of
the
kansas-colorado
border
arose
from
actual
existing
uses
of
water
in
the
respective
states.
notwithstanding
those
obvious
differences
from
this
case,
the
master
has
said,
and
i'm
quoting,
the
same
type
of
situation
exists
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
court
has
said
that
each
state
is
obligated
to
conserve
water
to
the
extent
that
is
economically
possible.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
and
no
discussion
in
the
special
master's
report,
as
opposed
to
colorado's
reply
brief,
that
there
were
any
uses
in
new
mexico
that
were
not
responsible
uses
of
water.
the
measure
of
water,
i
think,
is
one
that
the
master
did
not
follow,
and
i
think
it's
one
of
his
fundamental
mistakes.
what
the
master
should
have
done
in
assessing
the
water
right
entitlements
in
new
mexico
so
that
he
could
further
assess
injury
was
to
look
to
the
actual
historic
irrigated
acreage
on
the
river.
that
is
not
necessarily
the
decreed
right.
it
is
something
that
can
be
discovered
through
a
look
at
what's
been
irrigated
historically.
instead
of--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--oh,
i
think
he
definitely
can.
and
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
indicates
that
there
is
any
waste.
you'll
find
a
lengthy,
uninhibited
discussion
of
that
in
colorado's
brief.
you
will
find
no
discussion
of
it
in
the
special
master's
report.
i
think
it's
important
also
in
that
regard
to
make
a
distinction
early
on.
and
the
term
inefficiency
and
the
term
waste
are
used,
justice
o'connor,
throughout
the
briefs
in
this
case,
and
they're
important
to
the
case.
but
the
court
should
know
that
efficiency
is
a
term
of
art
in
irrigation
in
the
west.
it's
not
inefficiency
in
the
pejorative
sense.
efficiency
in
irrigation
is
a
term
used
to
describe
the
amount
of
water
diverted
which
is
not
consumed.
typically,
in
a
farming
operation
a
farmer
might
divert
100-acre
feet
of
water.
in
the
actual
growth
of
plants,
in
evapo-transpiration,
perhaps
50
percent
of
that
would
be
utilized.
the
rest
goes
back
to
the
regimen
of
the
stream.
that
use
is
called
50
percent
efficient.
the
inefficiency
results
from
a
bunch
of
physical
factors.
those
physical
factors
are
a
function
of
the
porosity
of
soils,
they're
a
function
of
local
temperature,
winds,
evaporation
rates
and
other
physical
factors.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no,
on
the
contrary,
justice
o'connor,
the
cases,
and
specifically,
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
indicate
that
farmers
are
obliged
to
be
only
as
efficient
as
they
economically
can
be
efficient.
there
is
not
one
iota
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
indicates
that
new
mexico's
farmers
could
have
been
more
efficient
historically
than
they
have
been.
they
don't
have
the
money
in
the
vermejo
conservancy
district,
as
an
example,
to
go
buy
extremely
expensive
sprinkler
irrigation
systems
and
thus
improve
the
irrigation
efficiency
by
10
to
20
percent.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
he
did
find...
i
don't
think
he
found...
yes,
he
did
find
that
it
was
inefficient.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
what
the
master
found
was
that
33
percent
of
the
water
diverted
was
lost
in
the
application
of
water
in
the
vermejo
conservancy
district.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
the
master
had
the
numbers
backwards.
actually,
67
percent
of
the
water
diverted
is
lost.
the
efficiency
of
the
vermejo
conservancy
district,
as
an
example,
is
roughly
in
the
middle
of
the
efficiency
of
western
reclamation
projects.
that
efficiency
is
54
percent.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
uncommon
about
that.
if
you
add
to
it
the
evaporation
from
the
various
reservoirs,
the
efficiency
drops
down
to
33
percent.
he
had
it
backwards.
that
is
not
an
uncommon
either.
in
calculating
efficiency,
you
don't
add
in
the
reservoirs.
that's
not
the
way
the
bureau
of
reclamation
would
do
it
in
calculating
efficiency.
the
master
has
done
it
quite
differently.
so
even
though
he
found
inefficiency,
first
of
all,
he
had
the
concept
of
efficiency
conceptually
backwards;
and
secondly,
it's
a
non
sequitur.
it
means
nothing.
if
the
efficiency
of
the
vermejo
conservancy
district--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--wyoming
versus
colorado,
colorado
versus
kansas,
nebraska
versus
wyoming.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
all
three
of
those
cases
support
us.
in
each
of
those
cases,...
well,
in
two
of
them,
particularly,
colorado
made
the
argument
that
they
could
take
water
and
use
it
better
elsewhere.
in
wyoming
versus
colorado,
as
an
example,
colorado
argued
that
we
can
take
water,
use
it
in
the
puter
valley
much
better
than
wyoming
can
use
it
in
the
laramie
valley.
the
court
rejected
that
argument
just
out
of
hand.
you'll
find
that
language
in
the
decision.
yes,
justice
rehnquist?
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
not
at
all,
in
response.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
somewhat
lengthy.
the
principles
set
down
by
this
court
in
every
equitable
apportionment
decision
that's
been
handed
down
before
would
lead
you
to
precisely
the
opposite
result
that
the
master
has
reached.
his
treatment
of
priority
of
appropriation
i
think
totally
misses
the
thrust
of
this
court's
decisions.
priority
of
appropriation
has
been
adopted
by
each
of
the
11
contiguous
western
states,
the
semi-arid
and
arid
western
states
that
are
west
of
the
100th
meridian.
the
jurisprudential
underpinning
of
that
doctrine
is
there
simply
is
not
enough
water
to
go
around
to
satisfy
the
conflicting
demands.
that's
the
basis
of
the
doctrine.
the
reason
for
priority
of
appropriation
lies
in
the
fact
that
recognition
of
the
benefit
or
the
equitable
interest
that
arises
out
of
the
application
to
beneficial
use
of
water
is
synonymous
with
the
uses
that
are
actually
made.
priority
of
appropriation
is
so
fundamental,
it's
been
enshrined
in
the
constitutions
of
almost
all
of
the
western
states
including
colorado
and
new
mexico.
without
it
in
the
west
there
would
have
been
chaos
and
would
today
be
chaos
in
water
administration.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
is
not
necessarily
decreed
rights.
you
have
to
look
at
the--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--if
there
were
enough
water
in
the
river
to
satisfy
the
average
annual
use...
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way.
i
would
call
it
the
average
historic
use...
there
would
be...
colorado
would
have
a
right,
in
my
view,
to
some
water.
i
think
not
in
these
circumstances
for
other
reasons.
colorado
has
sat
by
for
115
years
while
this
river
became
fully
appropriated.
colorado
has
acquiesced
in
the
total
use
of
the
river
by
new
mexico.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
reach
that
view.
i--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--if
your
facts
are
right,
there
would
be
water
available
for
colorado.
that
was
the
situation
in
the
two
cases
that
colorado
relies
on
so
heavily,
the
eastern
cases.
there
was
unappropriated
water.
the
problem
here
is
very
different.
you've
got
a
fully
appropriated
river;
the
court
has
already
got--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--no,
fully
appropriated
river.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
decreed
rights
is
an
example
for
the
vermejo
conservancy
district.
there
are
some
14,000
acres
of
decreed
right.
we
only
hope
that
the
court
would
recognize
their
ability
to
irrigate
what
the
bureau
of
reclamation
rehabilitated,
minus
what
might
be
expected
to
be
fallow,
about
10
percent.
the
total
irrigable
acreate
is
7380
acres.
what
the
master
did
here
was
take
colorado's
figures,
which
relate
to
a
period
of
drought
in
the
late
seventies,
and
reduced
the
entitlement
to
what
was
there
in
that
drought.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
it's
important
that
you
do
understand
that
the
master
was
incorrect
in
doing
that.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
it
is
a
factfinding,
but
it
is
spoiled
by
two
problems--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--in
that
respect,
but
not
to
come
out
on
our
side
in
general,
no.
because
the
basic
problem
that
the
master
did
was
to
look
at
what
he
called
the
economy
of
the
vermejo
conservancy
district,
and
he
didn't
make
a
finding
there
with
respect
to
new
mexico's
entitlement.
he
just
looked
at
that
district
and
concluded
that
the
district
was
uneconomic
and
that
he
could
ignore
that
entire
district
in
assessing
injury.
what
he
put
the
most
weight
on
when
he
did
that
was
the
fact
that
in
1980
congress
deferred
payment
for
the
construction
costs
of
that
district
after
a
congressional
finding
that
the
drought
in
the
late
seventies
had
made
it
impossible
for
the
farmers
in
the
district
to
pay
back
construction
costs.
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
that.
i
don't
think
the
master
knows
that.
historically,
congress
has
deferred
payment
for
each
and
every
reclamation
project
in
the
united
states
at
one
time
or
another.
congress
continues
to
do
it,
for
good
reason,
whenever
something
like
a
drought
prevents
the
repayment
of
construction
costs.
here,
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
farmers
have
made
their
construction
costs,
or
did
make
them,
all
the
way
up
through
1974.
they
made
a
partial
payment
in
1975.
they
have
always
made
the
o&m
costs.
the
other
failure
of
the
master
is
he
identified
profitability
of
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
with
the
economy
as
that
term
has
been
utilized
by
this
court
in
previous
equitable
apportionment
actions.
and
what
he
did,
for
instance,
was
look
to
evidence
that
we
presented
which
indicated
in
1979
there
was
a
net
operating
loss
of
$39,000
among
the
district's
63
farms.
he
took
evidence
like
that
and
thought
well,
this
economy
is
no
good;
therefore,
it
can't
be
injured.
what
he
fails
to
do
is
recognize
that
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
$39,000
net
operating
loss,
there
were
still
paid
in
1979
one
million
dollars
in
local
and
state
taxes
by
those
people;
there
were
also
mortgage
payments
being
made,
there
were
also
farm
implements
still
being
bought,
there
were
payments
being
made
to
local
banks.
the
families
that
live
there
have
children
that
go
to
school
that
have
medical
bills,
they
buy
shoes,
they
have
to
eat.
the
economy
is
still
there,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
was
a
net
operating
loss
in
that
year
of
$39,000.
i
think
the
master
has
a
totally
misconceived...
and
this
is
legal;
it
is
not
factual,
and
it
so
infects
his
finding,
justice
white,
that
i
think
that
it
is
rather
easy
for
the
court
to
conclude
that
he
was
wrong
with
respect
to
the
vermejo
conservancy
district.
he
did
something
differently
with
respect
to
all
of
the
other
users
in
new
mexico.
colorado
designed
this
case,
first
of
all,
to
try
to
eliminate
and
pare
down
the
water
rights
in
new
mexico
on
the
one
hand
and
then
inflate
the
amount
of
water
in
the
river
on
the
other.
what
they
did
was
try
to
limit
the
amount
of
acreage
to
the
acreage
irrigated
in
the
late
seventies.
therefore,
it
would
appear
that
there
might
be
some
water
made
available
for
cf&i.
colorado
took
the
figure
250
acres,
for
example,
to
the
vermejo
park
corporation,
the
first
diverter
in
new
mexico.
that's
what
was
irrigated
in
the
late
seventies.
well,
in
1978,
as
an
example,
in
the
vermejo
conservancy
district,
they
had
no
water
to
put
on
their
lands
because
of
the
drought.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
in
the
case
shows
that
the
actual
historic
irrigated
acreage...
this
is
not
the
decreed
acreage,
justice
o'connor...
the
historic
irrigated
acreage
of
vermejo
park
corporation
was
690
acres.
that
is
not
contradicted.
that
acreage
was
irrigated
before
1963.
that's
what
the
master
should
have
looked
at.
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
both
states,
you
can't
blame
the
farmer
for
drought
conditions.
his
property
right
doesn't
dissipate
just
because
it
didn't
rain
for
a
few
years.
that's
what
the
master
has
done
here.
because
it
didn't
rain,
he
has
just
killed
off
the
users
in
new
mexico.
secondly,
colorado
tried
to
throw
out
the
whole
bottom
half
of
the
river,
the
canadian.
and
what
he
has
done...
colorado
has
tried
to
make
it
appear
as
if
this
were
a
closed
basin
somehow,
and
that
water
does
not
get
on
down
to
the
canadian
river
users.
well,
one
of
the
glaring
contradictions
in
colorado's
case
here
is
when
they
went
to
water
division
2,
when
cf&i
went
to
water
division
2
in
1975
to
get
their
inchoate
water
right
in
colorado...
this
is
100
years
after
the
river
was
fully
appropriated
downstream...
they
were
thrown
out
of
court
initially
because
the
jurisdictional
embrace
of
the
court
in
colorado
goes
to
the
arkansas
river
drainage.
the
judge
sat
in
alamosa,
he
looked
to
the
east
and
saw
the
arkansas,
he
looked
to
the
south
and
saw
the
vermejo
and
said,
i
don't
have
jurisdiction,
that
doesn't
drain
into
the
arkansas.
well,
cf&i
went
back
to
court
and
vehemently
petitioned
the
court,
oh,
yes,
you
do
have
jurisdiction
because
the
vermejo
comes
down
here,
it's
tributary
to
the
canadian
here,
the
canadian
turns
east
and
flows
on
into
oklahoma,
and
over
there
it's
tributary
to
the
arkansas.
well,
that's
how
they
got
in
court
to
get
their
water
right.
now
they
turn
around
when
they
get
into
this
court
and
say
the
river
stops
when
you
get
down
to
the
vermejo
conservancy
district.
i
think
the
evidence
that
impressed
the
master
in
that
regard
was
not
the
testimony
of
the
farmers
downstream
that
indicated
that
they
rely
on
that
water.
it's
not
the
legal
fact
that
they
have
a
property
right
in
vermejo
water.
it
was
the
fact
that
in
a
certain
20-year
period
of
record,
only
6900
acre
feet
got
past
the
vermejo
conservancy
district's
point
of
diversion.
well,
if
you
look
at
the
30-year
period
of
records
just
prior
to
that,
you'll
find
out
that
an
average
annual
of
7,100
acre
feet
got
down.
i
don't
think
it
really
makes
any
difference
what
the
amount
is.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no,
it
is
not
inefficiency
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
except
in
periods
of
flood,
that
is
the
case.
but
there
are
frequent
floods
on
the
vermejo,
and
that
flood
flow
gets
down
to
the
canadian.
this
is
another
way
in
which
the
master
abused
the
evidence,
i
think,
in
his
treatment
of
assessing
injury
to
the
upstream
diverters.
he
took
the
average
annual
figures
that
were
provided
by
colorado
and
equated
those
with
divertible
flows.
this
court
has
three
times
said
you
can't
do
that.
you
can't
do
it
because
flood
flows
are
hidden
in
average
annual
flows.
when
it
rains
in
new
mexico,
it
rains
in
a
big
hurry.
a
lot
of
water
drops
in
a
small
place.
arroyos
become
raging
rivers.
farmers
can't
go
out
to
the
river;
they
can't
even
get
to
their
diversion
point.
if
they
could
get
to
their
diversion
point,
they
wouldn't
want
the
water
in
any
event
because
it's
so
full
of
silt
and
direct
that
it
wouldn't
be
of
any
use
to
them.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no,
it
is
not
a
rigid
doctrine.
this
court
has
varied
it,
however,
only
for
one
reason.
it
is
varied
to
protect
existing
economies
predicated
on
junior
uses
of
water.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
existing
at
the
time
of
the
lawsuit.
here,
you
would
apply
the
doctrine
to
accomplish
what
justice
douglas
so
painstakingly
did
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming
when
he
listed
all
of
those
factors
to
vary
it.
the
special
master
in
this
case
turns
the
law
of
equitable
apportionment
on
its
head.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
is
given
priority
as
a
preference
for
it
in
the
state
of
colorado.
i
don't
think
it's
true
in
most
western
states.
it's
not
true
in
new
mexico.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no,
they're
contemplating
taking
water
out
of
the
vermejo
river
and
putting
it
in
the
purgatoire
system
on
the
theory
that
there
is
need
in
the
purgatoire
system.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that's
a
good
question.
i
don't
think
cf&i
knows.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
water
division
2
thought
the
uses
were
so
speculative,
he
also
threw
it
out
for
that
reason,
to
begin
with
when
he
went.
i
don't
think
they
know
what
they
want
to
do.
there
is
some
agricultural
uses--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--yes.
they
claim
in
the
future
they're
going
to
use
it
for
synfuel
development,
and
they're
going
to
use
it
for
a
coal
washery
at
the
allen
mine
which
is
now
shut
down,
that
they're
going
to
use
it
for
some
agriculture.
those
were
the
uses
that
they
claimed.
your
honors,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
i
have
tried
to
save
eight
minutes;
i
see
it
was
reduced
to
five,
for
rebuttal.
i'd
like
to
keep
what
time
i
can
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
first
of
all,
i
want
to
remark
that
no
decision
of
this
court
in
any
prior
equitable
apportionment
case
has
sought
to
sacrifice
an
existing
economy
to
facilitate
a
new
use.
references
to
connecticut,
new
jersey,
and
so
on
are
simply
inopposite.
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
was
water
available
to
appropriate
and
findings
of
no
substantial
injury.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
it
is
the
controlling
factor
here,
very
obviously.
if
you
were
to
take
the
court's
latest
statement
on
the
subject,
you
find
it
in
arizona
versus
california.
there,
the
master,
applying
it
just
to
these
facts,
the
master
said
it
would
be
unreasonable
in
the
extreme
to
sacrifice
an
existing
economy
for
a
future
use.
the
master
apparently
didn't
even
read
arizona
versus
california.
he
just
missed
it
on--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--i
think
in
either
situation
there
would
still
be
the
attempt
by
the
court
to
protect
existing
economies.
that
is
the
underlying
theme
of
every
equitable
apportionment
case,
no
matter
whether
it
is
between
prior
appropriation
jurisdictions
or
between
appropriation
and
riparian
as
in
kansas
versus
colorado.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
no,
the
law
of
colorado
is
not
irrelevant
to
our
position.
the
law
of
colorado
has
in
it,
embodied
in
its
constitution,
the
same
equity
that
is
embodied
in
the
new
mexico
constitution.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
if
it
were
different--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--no,
if
it
were
different,
the
issues
would
be
slightly
different.
the
fundamental,
the
bottom
line,
however,
remains
the
same,
and
that
is,
the
court
protects
existing
water
rights.
here,
the
masters
recommended
exactly
the
opposite.
he
has
just
flipped
equitable
apportionment
decisions
and
priority,
its
meaning
and
significance,
on
its
head.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
that's
correct,
and
the
best
way
to
answer
that,
i
think,
justice
stevens,
is,
imagine
for
the
moment
this
were
an
intrastate
stream
in
colorado,
fully
appropriated--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
there
is
enough
law
there
to
answer
it.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
don't
think
there
is
enough
international
law
on
that
subject
to
answer
that
question.
but
under
colorado
law,
if
it
were
an
intrastate
stream,
you
can
see
how
outrageous
it
would
be,
how
absolutely
outrageous
if
cf&i
came
along
in
1975
and
somehow
could
divest
all
of
the
colorado
property
rights
that
had
been
on
that
river
for--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--the
source--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--the
source
of
law
on
which
i
rely
is
the
federal
common
law
handed
down
by
this
court
in
each
and
every
one
of
the
equitable
apportionment
cases.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
thank
you.
