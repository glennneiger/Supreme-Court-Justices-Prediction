mr.
robert
f.
welborn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
colorado
in
this
case
that
the
report
of
the
special
master
provides
for
a
fair
allocation,
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
water
of
the
vermejo
river.
it
is
based
on
16
days
of
actual
trial
extending
over
four
weeks,
50
witnesses,
300
exhibits
approximately.
it
is
prepared
by
a
judge
experienced
as
a
trial
judge
and
eminently
experienced
in
water
matters.
my
presentation
today
will
cover
four
basic
points:
colorado's
need
for
water,
colorado's
right
to
water;
thirdly
and
most
importantly,
the
fact
that
colorado
can
take
the
amount
of
water
allocated
by
the
special
master
without
adverse
impact
upon
legitimate
uses
in
new
mexico
if
reasonable
conservation
will
be
undertaken
there
to
eliminate
waste.
and
fourth,--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--fourth,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
by
reviewing
some
of
the
cases,
the
fourth
point
would
be
that
the
special
master's
report
is
entirely
in
accord
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
white,
did
you
want
to
ask
a
question?
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
preliminarily,
i
am
a
western
water
attorney.
i
don't
know
of
any
general
feeling
such
as
mr.
simms
suggests.
it
might
be
helpful,
although
i
know
you
have
the
briefs
and
a
description
of
the
river
system,
for
me
to
give
you
a
very
brief
survey
of
what
the
situation
is.
the
first
diversion
across
the
state
line
from
colorado
into
new
mexico
is
the
vermejo
park
corporation
which
diverts
enough
water
to
irrigate
250
acres.
it
has
a
decreed
right
for
870
acres
but
hasn't
been
using
that.
the
state
engineer
of
new
mexico,
mr.
reynolds,
the
chief
water
official
of
that
state,
testified
that
that
organization
could,
in
fact,
use
more
water
than
it
had
been
using.
this
relates
to
the
question
of
the
difference
between
decreed
usage
and
actual
usage.
the
next
user
down
the
stream
is
the
kaiser
steel
corporation.
the
maximum
amount
they've
used
is
361
acre
feet;
that
was
in
1976.
since
then,
they
have
used
less
than
that.
going
on
down,
there's
the
phelps
dodge
corporation
which
has
decreed
rights
for
500
acres,
or
1000
acre
feet.
the
allocation
is
two
acre
feet
per
acre.
but
phelps
dodge,
through
a
lessee,
is
irrigating
only
150
acres.
again,
new
mexico
officials
testified
that
they
could
use
more
water
than
they
have
been
using.
there's
been
reference
to
a
drought
in
the
seventies.
the
figures
really
belie
that.
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
in
the
seventies
irrigated
4,100
and
some
acres;
in
the
sixties
irrigated
4,500
and
some
acres.
the
measured
flow
at
the
dawson
gauge,
which
is
the
only
measuring
gauge
on
the
river,
was
some
8000
in
the
seventies,
some
11,000
in
the
sixties,
some
9000
in
the
fifties.
now,
this
doesn't
indicate
a
severe
drought
which
caused
this
unreal
situation
that
new
mexico
suggests.
going
down
then,
below
the
phelps
dodge
usage
is
the
vermejo
conservancy
district
diversion
point.
at
that
point,
they
have
a
canal
that's
capable
of
carrying
600
cubic
feet
per
second.
between
that
point
and
the
district
reservoirs,
there
are
individual
diverters
that
in
recent
years
have
been
taking
out
approximately
500
to
600
acre
feet
of
water.
so
that
you
have
no
more
than
1500
acre
feet
of
actual
usage
between
the
state
line
and
the
district
reservoirs.
between
that
diversion
point
of
the
district
and
the
district
reservoirs,
according
to
the
new
mexico
chief
witness,
there's
a
10
percent
loss
of
water.
in
the
reservoirs
themselves
by
evaporation,
there's
a
2300
acre
foot
loss
of
water
which
amounts
to
something
between
20
and
25
percent.
so
you
have
about
a
one-third
loss
of
water
between
the
district
diversion
point,
and
the
point
of
outflow
from
the
reservoirs.
then
from
the
reservoirs
to
the
fields,
again
according
to
the
testimony
of
new
mexico
witnesses,
there's
another
33
percent
loss,
and
that's
what
the
special
master
was
referring
to,
and
he
was
entirely
correct.
he
didn't
have
his
figures
mixed.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
justice
white,
in
his
report
he
said
that
the
system
of
canals
used
to
transport
the
water
to
the
fields
is
inefficient.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
i'm
at
page
8
of
his
report.
now,
the
only
reference
in
the
new
mexico
testimony
to
a
system
of
canals...
and
in
fact,
the
only
system
of
canals...
is
the
system
from
the
reservoirs
to
the
fields.
so
that
is
exactly
what
the
special
master
was
referring
to.
in
order
to
argue
their
point,
new
mexico
changes
the
subject
of
that
sentence
and
says
in
their
brief
that
the
special
master
found
that
the
district
was
so
inefficient
that
it
lost
33
percent
of
the
water.
they
make
the
subject
of
that
sentence
the
district
rather
than
the
system
of
canals.
and
it's
really
a
point
that
shouldn't
be
involved
in
this
case,
because
the
facts
are
so
clear
and
new
mexico
acknowledges
that
colorado's
exhibit
71
is
accurate
in
this
regard;
that
there
is
a
two-thirds
loss
of
water
from
the
district
diversion
point
to
the
fields.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
well,
this,
justice
white,
gets
to
my
first
and
my
third
point,
which
is
really
the
basic
point
here,
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
elimination
of
waste
by
the
district
that
will
offset
the
colorado
allocation.
new
mexico's
exhibit
e3,
which
is
perhaps
the
most
important
exhibit
in
the
case,
is
a
detailed
engineering
report
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
district
supplies
stock
water,
water
to
the
livestock
of
the
district.
and
this
livestock
system
is
simply
an
open
ditch
system
whereby
the
water
is
released
from
the
reservoirs
and
taken
to
the
fields.
the
livestock
consume
approximately
35
acre
feet
of
water,
but
in
order
to
get
this
35
acre
feet
of
water
to
the
livestock
there
must
be
released
from
the
reservoirs
over
2000
acre
feet.
so
you
can
see
there's
about
a
98
percent
loss
there.
now,
the
exhibit
e3
demonstrates
that
by
a
closed
system
which
can
be
financed
to
a
large
extent
by
soil
conservation
assistance,
farm
home
administration
assistance,
that
by
a
closed
system
this
2000
acre
feet
loss
can
be
eliminated.
and
not
only
will
it
be
eliminated,
but
the
district
will
benefit
because
they
will
get
a
domestic
system
as
well
as
a
stock
water
system,
and
the
stock
water
will
be
available
12
months
out
of
the
year
instead
of
9
1/2
months
out
of
the
year,
as
it
is
now.
the
other
two
and
a
half
months
they
have
to
haul
the
stock
water.
the
reason
for
that
is
it's
in
the
winter
months
when
the
ditches
are
frozen.
now,
if
this--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--yes,
there
is,
justice
o'connor.
in
three
cases,
this
court
talks
about
wasteful
uses,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
court
can
tell
a
state
or
anyone
in
a
state
in
detail
what
it
has
to
do.
but
the
guiding
principle
here
is
equity.
what
are
the
equitable
considerations.
and
colorado
versus
kansas
says
that
all
factors
bearing
on
the
equities
must
be
considered
as
of
the
time
of
the
controversy.
now,
in
nebraska,--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--i
think
that
i
can
answer,
then,
perhaps
both
questions
at
the
same
time.
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
which
is
essentially
the
last
case,
although
arizona
versus
california
is
still
pending,
did
say
that
priority
of
appropriation
may
be
a
main
consideration,
but
it
listed
a
number
of
other
factors.
and
one
of
those
other
factors
is
wasteful
uses.
wyoming
versus
colorado,
which
seems
to
indicate
that
priority
of
appropriation
would
be
followed
also
lists
waste
as
a
factor.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
they
do
not...
it's
a
matter
of
degree,
of
course,
justice
rehnquist.
in
colorado,
for
example,
the
definition
of
beneficial
use
in
its
statutes
is
the
use
of
that
amount
of
water
to
accomplish,
without
waste,
the
purpose
for
which
the
appropriation
is
intended.
and
colorado
statutes
direct
the
water
officials
to
shut
down
diversions
if
waste
is
occurring.
now,
this
brings
up
a
basic
consideration
here,
and
that
is
that
although
two
states
may
follow
the
priority
of
appropriation
doctrine,
this
does
not
mean
by
any
stretch
that
they
have
the
same
water
line.
we
found
by
the
testimony
in
this
case,
for
example,
that
the
new
mexico
officials
exercise
no
surveillance
over
the
diversions
of
water
from
the
purgatoire.
they
don't
determine
whether
the
proper
amount
of
water
is
being
diverted
in
relation
to
the
acreage
irrigated,
and
new
mexico--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--excuse
me,
on
the
vermejo.
they
do
not,
as
colorado
does,
declare
forfeitures
or
abandonments
of
water
rights
when
water
rights
have
not
been
used
or
portions
of
water
rights
have
not
been
used
for
a
number
of
years.
they
allow...
the
new
mexico
laws
and
procedures
allow
the
proliferation
of
stock
ponds
along
the
tributaries
of
the
vermejo
which
are
referred
to
time
and
again
in
the
bureau
of
reclamation
documents,
and
these
are
exhibits
37
to
48
in
the
record.
these
documents
say
that
these
proliferations
of
stock
ponds
along
the
vermejo
are
the
major
cause
of
the
water
condition.
colorado
does
not
permit
that.
if
stock
ponds
of
that
nature...
these
are
ponds
constructed
on
tributaries
of
the
river
to
provide
water
for
livestock...
if
stock
ponds
of
that
nature
are
constructed
and
they
are
causing
injury,
then
something
can
be
done
about
it.
the
new
mexico
law
does
not
provide
for
that.
the
point
is
that
priority
of
appropriation...
and
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
it
cannot
control,
because
it
is
only
one
consideration.
that's
what
nebraska
versus
wyoming
said,
that's
what
wyoming
versus
colorado
in
effect
said,
and
new
mexico
argues
that
point
very
strenuously
in
its
brief
in
the
arizona
versus
california
case,
which
is
in
the
file,
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
i'm
saying
that
the
decisions
have
said
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
the
decisions
have
said
that.
the
master
in
this
case,
incidentally,
was
very
familiar
with
wyoming
versus
colorado
because
he
was
attorney
general
to
wyoming
during
one
phase
of
that.
and
he
was
very
impressed
with
certain
similarities
there.
now,
as
new
mexico
argues
in
its
brief
in
the
arizona
versus
california
case,
it
might
seem
at
first
blush
that
wyoming
versus
colorado
calls
for
the
straight
application
of
priority
of
appropriation.
but
it
does
not,
because
in
that
case,
as
in
this
case
before
the
court,
a
specific
amount
of
water
was
allocated
to
colorado
which
it
would
take
regardless
of
priority.
and
starting
with
the
first
case,
kansas
versus
colorado,
this
court
said
the
states
come
here
on
the
basis
of
equality
of
right.
it
said
this
doesn't
mean
there
shall
be
an
equal
division.
but
it
says...
and
connecticut
versus
massachusetts
goes
on
to
say
that
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation
than
that
which
obtains
in
private
controversies
between
parties
where
priority
is
the
straight
rule.
and
the
cases
again
and
again
emphasize,
as
nebraska
versus
wyoming
quotes
again
from
colorado
versus
kansas,
it
says,
all
factors,
all
factors,
bearing
on
the
equities
must
be
considered.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
i'm
suggesting
that
that
would
be
a
matter
for
the
court
to
consider
in
its
balancing
of
equities;
that
the
door
is
not
closed
for
the
new
use.
there
are
three
cases
of
this
court
involving
new
uses.
connecticut
versus
massachusetts,
new
jersey
versus
new
york
and
wyoming
versus
colorado.
those
are
all
new
uses.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
the
first
two,
justice
rehnquist,
were
riparian
states,
but
there's
a
great
similarity.
in
new
jersey
versus
new
york,
for
example,
new
jersey
came
in
and
said
that
they
were
entitled
to
have
the
stream
flow
in
its
more
or
less
original
condition
by
reason
of
their
riparian
rights.
now,
that's
exactly
what
new
mexico
is
contending
here;
that
by
virtue
of
these
decreed
priority
rights,
it's
entitled
to
have
the
river
flow
in
its
original
condition.
and
the
court
in
new
jersey
versus
new
york
said
that
the
thing
to
do
in
these
cases
is
to
achieve
equitable
apportionment...
and
these
are
the
very
words...
to
achieve
equitable
apportionment
without
quibbling
over
formulas.
and
what
the
court
meant
there
by
formulas
was
the
formula
of
a
particular
state
water
line.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
is
an
equitable
proceeding.
this
is
an
original
proceeding
in
equity,
and
that
it
should
not
be
controlled
by
any
rule
of
law.
priority
is
a
rule
of
law;
statutory
law
within
the
states.
it
would
be
grossly
inequitable
to
apply
it
here
because
of
the
great
divergence
between
the
colorado
law
and
the
new
mexico
law.
if
it
were
applied,
which
state's
law
would
govern?
how
would
it
be
administered?
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
justice
white,
i
do
think
that
they
are
adequate.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
the
average
historic
use
in
the
vermejo
conservancy
district?
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
i
don't
believe
that
it
gives
the
detail
of
that,
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
if--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
we
do
discuss
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
no.
and
the--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--this
is
exactly
right,
and
i
don't
believe
for
that
purpose
the
special
master
need
to
have
gone
into
the
detail
of
the
uses
there.
he
gave
the--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--not
necessarily,
justice
white,
and
i
will
explain
why
not.
the
new
mexico
has
testified,
their
chief
witness
has
testified
that--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--he
didn't
get
into
these
facts,
but
he
found
that
there
would
be--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--he
found
that--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--there
certainly
evidence,
and
i
would,
if
i
may,
like
to
point
that
out
because
i
think
it's
very
basic
to
this
case.
and
that
is
that
the
new
mexico
chief
witness,
mr.
moots,
testified,
and
this
is
page
1323
of
the
transcript,
that
essentially
the
entire
effect
of
the
colorado
diversion
would
be
felt
by
the
conservancy
district.
in
other
words,
these
other
users
who
had
priority,
all
of
them
had
priority--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--the
reason
i
say--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--i
do
say
that.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
the
conservancy
district...
and
this
is
the
purpose,
justice
white,
of
the
reservoir
system...
the
conservancy
district
operates
on
the
basis
of
these
reservoirs.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that
contain
thousands
of
acre
feet
of
water.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
in
five
straight
dry
years
of--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--well,
i
don't
believe
the
records...
colorado's
exhibit
5,
table
2,
tabulates
the
u.s.
geological
survey
records
for
the
period
of
record
at
the
dawson
gauge,
and
they
don't
find
a
period
of
five
straight
years
that
you
have
that
sort
of
a
situation,
but
i
would--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--i
would
acknowledge
if
there
were
five
straight
years
you
would
see
a--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
colorado
diversion
would
take
place
at
a
point
from
which
approximately
only
one-half
of
the
colorado
production
of
water
could
be
taken.
in
other
words,
the
special
master
that
colorado
contributed
about
half
of
the
water
in
the
romeo
system,
if
you
allow
for
depletions
and
so
forth,
about
8,400
acre
feet,
and
the
colorado
diversion
would
be
taken
at
a
point
where...
above
the
state
line,
where
it
would
take
only
half.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
it
would
reduce
the
amount
of
water
that
would
reach
the
state
line,
and
if
you
have
the
hypothetical
situation
of
five
straight
years,
i
won't
say
there
wouldn't
be
an
effect.
everybody
would
be
affected.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
but
in
a
dry
year,
of
course,
the
amount
of
water
colorado
could
take
would
be
diminished
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
water
anyone
else
could
take.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that,
as
i
say,
geographically,
that
wouldn't
happen
because
of
the
diversion
points,
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
the
decree
in
this
case,
the
diversion
points
could
be
specified
to
be
those
named
in
the
colorado
decree
or
points
above
those
that
are
named.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
well,
as
i
say,
if
the
diversion
is
limited
to
those
diversion
points,
there
would
be
a
built-in
safety
factor,
but
this
gets
back,
justice
white,
to
the
basic
point.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that
the
states
stand
in
these
proceedings
on
the
basis
of
equality
of
right,
and
as
new
mexico
has
said
in
each
brief,
in
the
arizona
versus
california,
states
have
sovereign
interests,
and
that
what
these
cases
consider
is
a
division
of
the
benefits.
they
are
not
bound
by
any
hard,
fast
rule
of
law.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
no.
that
is
one
method
to
eliminate
a
few
thousand
acre
foot
loss,
and
this
exhibit,
e-3,
demonstrates
how
it
can
be
done,
and
this
is
new
mexico's
exhibit
that
went
into
the
record.
additionally,
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
waste
through
these
stock
farms
that
i
mentioned,
that
are
mentioned
again
and
again
in
the--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--that
is
quite
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
that
bears
on
the
equity.
i
don't
think
that
it's...
that
colorado
has
to
be
asked
to
forego
a
proper
amount
of
water
from
this
river
to
subsidize
uses
in
new
mexico
that
are
not
reasonably
efficient.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
this
court
has
gotten
into
those
things
in
some
detail.
in
washington
versus
oregon,
for
example,
the
court
was
ready
to
conclude
that
oregon
diversions
should
not
be
curtailed,
and
the
court
said
to
itself,
as
stated
in
the
opinion,
well,
first
we've
got
to
look
to
see
whether
these
oregon
uses
are
wasteful
or
not.
the
court
then
went
on...
there
was
a
question
in
that
case
about
a
water
right
in
washington,
and
the
court
went
on
to
declare
that
that
water
right
for
the
purpose
of
the
case
was
to
be
considered
abandoned,
so
the
court
has
gotten
into
these
internal
factors.
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
this
court
said
that
for
the
purpose
of
that
case,
the
court
could
look
at
the
priorities
within
a
particular
state.
it
is
done,
i
suggest,
in
reverse.
the
court
says
that
if
you
want
the
equity
of
this
court...
it
says
this
to
a
state...
you
have
got
to
come
in
with
reasonably
efficient
uses.
if
you
want
the
equity
of
this
court
to
say
this
other
state
and
the
needed
uses
in
that
state,
and
here
the
colorado
uses...
this
is
not
just
cf&i,
the
state
engineer
of
colorado
testified
as
to
the...
and
set
forth
in
his
exhibit
14
the
great
need
of
colorado
for
this
water.
this
water
will
come
into
colorado
and
be
used
and
reused
in
the
purgatory
valley.
in
that
valley,
there
are
300
water
rights
comprising
788
cubic
feet
per
second.
the
state
engineer
of
colorado
testified
that
over
99
percent
of
the
time
there
is
not
enough
water
in
the
river
to
satisfy
those
needs.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
i
suggest--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--i
think
that--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--did
you
want
me
to
list
those
and
just
how
many
in
terms
of
number,
or
do
you
want
me
to
describe
them?
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
well,
i
should
think
that
the
court
could
base
its
conclusions
on
the
finding
of
the
special
master
that
there
would
be
no
material
injury
to--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--and
i
suggest
that
the
court--
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
--right,
could
look
at
the
record,
as
new
mexico
has
even
suggested,
and
determine
these
factors.
if
it
feels
that
it
should
go
beyond
the
conclusion
of
the
special
master
and
make
a
finding
that
was
reasonable
conservation
as
was
stated
in
wyoming
versus
colorado,
with
reasonable
conservation,
as
was
suggested
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
and
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
is
a
proper
rule
of
law.
mr.
robert
f.
welborn
yes,
i
think
you
do.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it
is
a
matter
of
degree,
and
this
is
exactly
what
this
court
was
dealing
with
in
connecticut
versus
massachusetts.
in
connecticut
versus
massachusetts,
it
was
a
matter
of
degree.
sure,
there
was
going
to
be
some
effect
on
the
connecticut
river
when
the
city
of
boston
took
a
tremendous
quantity
of
water
out
of
the
river,
and
took
it
into
the
merimac
river,
but
the
court
weighed
the
equities,
and
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
in
prior
cases,
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that
is
what
the
special
master
did.
he
said
that
colorado
is
a
sovereign
state,
and
it
has
certain
interests
that
are
above
and
beyond
the
interests
of
its
citizens,
and
above
and
beyond
those
that
would
obtain
in
a
controversy
between
private
parties,
but
he
also
found
that
there
would
be
no
material
injury,
and
there
were
material
injury,
there
would
be
countervailing...
there
are
hard
countervailing
equities
in
favor
of
colorado,
and
it
is
these
countervailing
equities,
the
colorado
need
for
water,
that
is
a
basic
factor
here.
but
as
to
the
findings
that
this
court
would
have
to
make
to
enter
its
decree,
i
think
that
the
special
master's
report
has
the
basic
considerations
that
he...
that
are
the
result
of
his
evaluation
of
this
very
thorough
record,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
they
would
be
virtually
sufficient,
in
view
of
the
law
that
this
court
has
announced
in
its
prior
decision.
and
this,
of
course,
brings
me
to
the
last
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
in
this
argument,
and
that
is
that
the
special
master's
report
is
very
much
in
accord
with
these
prior
decisions.
he
considered
all
of
the
factors.
he
properly
rejected
priority
as
the
sole
consideration,
and
here
again,
i
would
respectfully
refer
you
to
new
mexico's
own
brief
in
arizona
versus
california,
which
refers
to
an
equitable
division
of
the
benefits,
and
rejects
the
idea
of
priority
regardless
of
state
line.
it
was
there
referring,
i
believe,
to
the
wyoming
versus
colorado
case.
what
new
mexico
and
the
amici
really
are
seeking
here,
i
suggest,
is
just
that,
priority
regardless
of
state
line,
a
rule
of
law
based
on
these
paper
decrees,
and
those
were
sifted
out,
i
suggest,
by
the
special
master.
i
can't
emphasize
too
strongly
the
difference
between
the
laws
of
these
two
states,
even
though
the
follow
the
priority
of
appropriation
doctrine,
difference
in
administration,
difference
in...
colorado
carries
their
water
rights
on
the
basis
of
historic
use,
actual
use.
the
new
mexico
officials
testified,
mr.
compton
and
mr.
reynolds,
that
new
mexico
carries
them
on
the
basis
of
the
decreed
right.
and
this
stock
farm
situation
by
impartial
observers,
so
to
speak,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
officials,
is
a
most
serious
matter
which,
if
it
existed
in
colorado,
would
be
alleviated,
because
colorado
law
provides
for
that.
the
special
master
did
indeed
consider
benefit-detriment.
this
was
first
suggested
in
the
first
case,
kansas
versus
colorado.
it
was
reiterated
in
the
most
recent
case,
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
and
what
he
did,
i
suggest,
was
do
just
what
nebraska
versus
wyoming
told
him
to
do.
he
reached
an
informed
judgment
on
the
basis
of
many
factors,
rejecting
the
priority
of
appropriation
as
the
sole
consideration.
mr.
simms
alluded
to
the
canadian
river
situation,
saying
that
you
should
look
beyond
the
romeo
conservancy
district
diversion
point.
new
mexico's
own
exhibit,
f-29,
shows
that
in
only
six
years
out
of
30
did
any
water
pass
beyond
the
district
diversion
point.
thank
you.
