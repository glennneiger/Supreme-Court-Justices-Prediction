we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
80
original,
state
of
colorado
against
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
others.
mr.
simms,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
important
thing,
mr.
simms,
of
course,
is
whether
we
understand
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happens,
mr.
simms,...
let
me
give
you
this
hypothetical.
a
state
like
colorado
having
a
modest
population
back
20
or
30
years
ago
and
doesn't
claim
any
of
the
water
under
your
priority
of
appropriation
concept.
and
then
suddenly,
as
with
california
and
florida,
ten,
15
million
people
flood
into
the
state
and
populate
it.
and
the
need...
a
new
need
for
water
arises.
is
this
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation
a
rigid
doctrine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
existing
when?
then
or
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
simms.
mr.
welborn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you
have
two
minutes
remaining,
mr.
simms.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
simms,
are
you
saying
that
the
prior
appropriation
is
the
controlling
factor
in
all
of
these
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
simms.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
