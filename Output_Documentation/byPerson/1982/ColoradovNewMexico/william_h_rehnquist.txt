justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that,
if
i
read
page
21
of
the
master's
report
correctly,
that
he
said
there
that
if
you
apply
the
rule
of
prior
appropriation
in
this
case,
it
would
prevent
any
diversion
to
colorado.
so
that,
in
effect,
the
master
has
said
as
between
two
states,
both
of
which
apply
appropriative
water
law,
you
do
not
apply
prior
appropriation
law
in
the
interstate
stream
adjudication
if
it
results
in
one
state
not
getting
any
water.
and
the
question
really
is
whether
the
court's
prior
cases
support
that
departure
from
appropriation
law
in
the
case
of
two
states
which
follow
that
principle.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about
the
water
getting
down
past
the
vermejo
diversion
point,
that's
because
of
what
you
referred
to
as
inefficiency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it?
i
mean,
if
the
stream
were
entirely
appropriated,
one
would
expect,
i
would
think,
that
after
the
last
diversion
point
you
would
only
get
water
that
was
being
returned
to
the
stream
system.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
supplying
of
domestic
water
given
priority
in
most
western
states
as
opposed
to
use
for
irrigation
or
manufacturing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
any
rate,
colorado
fuel
and
iron
wasn't
contemplating
giving
drinking
water
to
a
lot
of
people
by
its
use,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
response
to
justice
o'connor,
but
let
me
just
throw
in
this
question
and
answer
it
when
you
can,
if
you
wish.
i
understood
the
master
to
take
the
rather
flat
position
at
page
21
of
his
report,
he
says
right
at
the
end
of
the
quote,
at
the
top,
"if
the
rule
of
priority
were
to
be
strictly
applied
in
colorado
versus
new
mexico.
"
this
case,
"a
diversion
of
water
by
colorado
could
not
occur.
"
"as
the
court
has
held
before,
facts
other
than
priority
must
be
applied
to
achieve
equity
in
these
cases
involving
an
interstate
river.
"
now,
i
regard
that
last
statement
of
the
master
as
somewhat
dubious
in
the
light
of
our
prior
cases.
i
think
he
departed
rather
substantially
here
from
the
prior
appropriation
law
that
would
have
been
applied
either
in
colorado
or
in
new
mexico.
and
i
would
be
interested
in
hearing
your
explanation
of
why
our
prior
cases
authorize
this
sort
of
departure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
most
state
systems
that
follow
the
appropriation
system
themselves
allow
for
discounting
of
wasteful
uses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
the
purgatoire?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
first
two
were
riparian
states.
