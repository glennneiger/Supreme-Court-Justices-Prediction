i
personally
find
it
kind
of
amazing
that
you
cite
it
to
us.
you
can't
even
given
us
any
authority
for
it
at
all.
suppose
we
get
on
to
the
central
issues
of
the
case.

mr.
welborn,
with
all
of
this,
it
strikes
me
none
of
this
was
in
the
master's
report.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
very
simple
question.
approximately
how
many
findings,
and
i
mean
findings,
will
we
have
to
make
to
decide
in
your
favor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
findings
we
will
have
to
make
that
the
master
did
not
make.
justice
thurgood
marshall
either
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
a
difference
in
your
thinking
between
conclusions
and
findings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
findings.
