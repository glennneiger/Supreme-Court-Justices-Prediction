mr.
simms,
what's
your
benchmark
for
appropriation?
is
it
the
water
that's
actually
been
used
historically,
or
is
it
just
decreed
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
this
case?
let's
just
suppose
that
the
average
annual
use
was
x
and
that
there
was
more
water
in
the
river
than
that.
but
the
decreed
rights
were
xx,
and
with
xx
there
wouldn't
be
any
water
left.
now,
would...
under
equitable
apportionment,
would
colorado
in
this
case,
for
example,
be
entitled
to
some
water
if
there
was
more
water
in
the
river
than
necessary
to
satisfy
average
annual
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
this
case
suppose
our
view
of
the
record
was
that
there
was
water
left
over
in
the
river
after
satisfying
the
average
historic
use,
as
you
put
it,
of
the
new
mexico
users.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
suppose.
let's
suppose
on
the
facts.
suppose
my
facts
are
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
mean
a
fully
decreed
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there's
absolutely
no
water
left
over
in
the
river
after
you
satisfy
the
average
historic
uses
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
to
decide
this
case
properly...
do
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
master
was
incorrect
in
doing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
factfinding?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
have
to
overturn
the
master
in
this
respect
to
come
out
on
your
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
what?
what
specific
use
does
cf&i
contemplate,
or
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
in
the
record,
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
about
it?
in
the
record
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
wait
until
you
get
to
your
point.
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
go
ahead.
i'll
wait.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
what
he
was
referring
to?
he
didn't
make
these
kind
of
detailed
findings
about
the
water
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
page
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
if
there
is,
mr.
welborn?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
welborn,
do
you
think
the
findings
of
the
special
master
are
adequate
for
us
to
tell
what
the
impact
would
be
on
the
conservancy
district
if
colorado
is
given
a
priority
for
4000
feet
of
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
we
know
from
the
master's
report
how
much
the
average
historic
use
is,
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
these
four
users.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly
argue
a
lot
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
brief
certainly
argues
a
lot
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
master
didn't
find
it,
and
do
you
think
that
the
priority
given
colorado
would
mean
that
some
of
the
historic
use,
average
use,
would
be
interfered
with
in
new
mexico?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
there's
enough
water
to
satisfy
colorado's
priority?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
true,
he
could
have
avoided...
he
might
have
avoided
a
lot
of
argument
about...
that
you've
been
making.
but
let's
suppose
you're
right
about
average
historic
use.
but
that
means
average.
how
about
a
dry
year?
you
know
that
in
the
seventies
if
colorado
took
4000
feet
out
first,
somebody
was
going
to
get
hurt
in
new
mexico.
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
special
master
certainly
didn't
get
into
these
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
he
could
have
made
these
findings,
couldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
evidence
from
which
he
could
have
made
the
kind
of
findings
that
you
want
us
to
recognize
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
that
the
conservancy
district
wouldn't
even
feel
it,
in
an
average
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
i
ask
you
again,
what
about
a
dry
year?
what
about
the
driest
year
there
was
in
the
1970s?
if
colorado
takes
4000
feet
out
first,
you
know
the
conservancy
district
is
going
to
feel
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
five
straight
dry
years.
you
know
you're
going
to
have
a
problem.

[generallaughter.]
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
not
unheard
of,
is
it?
mr.
welborn,
that
is
not
unheard
of,
either,
five--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
would
suggest
if
you
were
going
to
make
this
kind
of
submission,
that
even
in
a
dry
year
the
conservancy
district
isn't
going
to
get
hurt.
this
whole
case
disappears.
it
is
just
a
tempest
in
a
teapot.
certainly
the
special
master
never
made
any
findings
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
one
dry
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
it
would
still
reduce
the
amount
of
water
that
reached
the
state
line
by
4,000
acre
feet.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
even
know
from
the
findings
of
the
master
whether
there
would
be
an
effect
in
one
dry
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
there
might...
i
understand
colorado
is
entitled
to
take
4,000
acre
feet
out
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
colorado,
under
this
allocation,
could
take
up
to
4,000
acre
feet
out
of
those
particular
streams.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
