mr.
simms,
may
i
ask
you
whether
it's
your
position
that
as
between
two
states,
both
of
which
are
states
using
the
appropriated
water
theory,
that
the
prior
appropriator
must
make
reasonable
use
of
the
water
that's
appropriated?
do
we
measure
the
decreed
rights
or
the
appropriated
rights
by
some
measure
of
reasonable
use,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
historic
use
is
somehow
wasteful,
can
the
master
take
that
into
consideration
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
there
be
any
support
in
the
case
law,
counsel,
for
requiring,
for
example,
the
appropriation
user
to
line
ditches
with
concrete,
or
anything
of
that
sort?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
welborn,
do
our
cases
require
a
state
to...
or
a
prior
appropriator...
to
make
that
kind
of
structural
change
to
utilize
the
water
more
efficiently?
is
there
authority
in
the
case
law
for
making
that
kind
of
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
welborn,
in
order
to
make
your
argument
that
new
mexico
wouldn't
be
hurt,
do
you
have
to
assume
that
new
mexico
will
have
made
more
efficient
use
of
the
water?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
your
basic
assumption--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
they
have
gone
out
and
put
underground
pipes
or
something
in
to
take
water
to
water
the
stock.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
point
is,
for
you
to
say
new
mexico
wouldn't
be
hurt,
you
are
assuming
new
mexico
will
apply
some
conservation
measures
that
have
not
historically
been
applied.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
to
what
extent
do
you
think
courts
have
a
right
to
get
in
in
these
disputes
and
weigh
the
extent
to
which
ditches
should
be
lined,
or
pipelines
installed,
or
new
storage
facilities
built,
and
so
on?
