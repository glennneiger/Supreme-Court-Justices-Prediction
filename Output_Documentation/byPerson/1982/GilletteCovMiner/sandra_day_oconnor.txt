mr.
miller,
how...
i
suppose
the
real
parties
in
interest
here
are
the
members
of
the
class,
if
it's
certified.
they're
the
people
whose
cause
of
action
we're
talking
about.
and
how
does
gillette
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
raise
the
question
now
for
their
benefit
or
the
lack
thereof?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wasn't
that
an
indispensable
party
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
would
go
to
whether
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
i
don't
think
that's
similar
to
letting
gillette
come
in
and
argue
on
behalf
of
the
potential
class--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
under
the
illinois
court
order
they
would
be
given
notice,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
can
opt
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
a
plaintiff
from
montana
then
come
to
illinois
and
file
an
action
against
gillette
for
the
lighter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
could
a
group
of
plaintiffs
get
together
and
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
are
you
basically
saying
that
due
process
allows
an
opt
in
procedure
but
not
an
opt
out
procedure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
under
the
notice
and
opt
out
procedure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
our
decision
last
term
in
underwriters
national
assurance
company
where
a
state
court
exercised
jurisdiction
in
what
amounted
to
a
class
action
involving
people
in
other
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
these,
instead
of
inexpensive
cricket
lighters
we
have
$10,000
value
widgets,
and
the
suit
were
brought
in
the
district
court,
federal
district
court
in
illinois?
would
you
say
that
a
class
action
could
be
maintained
in
the
federal
district
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
take
it
your
answer
is
the
federal
district
court
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
either--
