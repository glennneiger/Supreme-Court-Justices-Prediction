justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
perhaps
a
response
would
be
that
only
four
justices
are
required
to
grant
certiorari.
[laughter]
and
another
might
be
that
there's
an
instrument
called
dig
which
translates
"dismissed
as
improvidently
granted".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
weren't
those
all
minimum
contacts
required
on
behalf
of
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
mr.
miller,
you
used
the
word
"substantial
risk"
in
the
argument
you
just
made,
and
i
suppose
that
conveys
your
idea
that
we
can't
foresee
exactly
what
would
happen
if
an
illinois
judgment
including
claims
on
behalf
of
some
plaintiffs
from
out
of
state
became
final,
and
gillette
paid
off
on
it,
and
then
another
complaint
was
brought
by
someone
who
had
accepted
the
offer
in
another
state.
just
as
a
matter
of
prudential
jurisprudence
wouldn't
it
make
more
sense
for
us
in
this
rather
unknown
area
that
you're
talking
about
to
wait
until
that
happens
rather
than
to--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
settlement
of
this
particular
class
action
by
gillette
in
the
illinois
action
really
solve
gillette's
problems,
if
mr.
miller
is
right
and
the
problem
is
later
suits
in
other
jurisdictions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
that
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
at
all
to
me,
your
answer.
i
would
think
anyone
who
didn't
opt
out,
if
mr.
miller
is
right,
could
well
have
an
action
say
in
the
state
of
oregon
where
he
lives
under
oregon
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying...
would
your
position
be
different
if
the
individual
claims
were
say
$2,500
each
instead
of
$7.95
each?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
judicial
expenses.
are
you
suggesting
you
have
to
pay
the
judges?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
attorneys'
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understood
mr.
miller
to
concede
quite
frankly
that
none
of
our
cases
had
applied
the
contacts
rule
to
plaintiffs,
but
i
would
think
that
maybe
that's
because
up
until
now
you
have
had
real
live
plaintiffs
as
opposed
to
class
action
plaintiffs,
and
that
if
a
real
live
plaintiff
comes
into
a
forum
and
sues
somebody,
certainly
he
has
waived
any
right
he
had
to
challenge
jurisdiction.
but
here
you
have
people
who
are
associate
on
the
plaintiff's
side
of
the
complaint
who
have
not
themselves
made
that
choice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he's
also
lost
his
right...
supposing
he
recovers
the
magnificent
sum
of
$5.00
in
the
class
action
you're
bringing
for
him
in
illinois,
and
supposing
he's
in
oregon
and
oregon
has
a
statute
that
says
anyone
who
is
imposed
upon
the
way
you
say
gillette
imposed
on
these
people
shall
have
a
right
to
recover
actual
damages
plus
$1,000
punitive
damages.
now,
i
presume
gillette
would
use
the
illinois
judgment
to
bar
him
or
seek
to
bar
him
if
he
brought
suit
in
his
home
state
of
oregon.
that
assumes
that
illinois
would
not
in
any
way
be
applying...
would
be
applying
strictly
illinois
law
to
the
situation.
we
have
two
counts
in
this
complaint.
we
have
both
a
contract
count
and
a
statutory
consumer
fraud
count.
and
states
as
well
as
the
federal
courts
apply
laws
to
the
various
states
as
they
get
to
them.
now,
if...
if,
as
you
say,
there
is
a
punitive
damage
count
or...
or...
and
there
are
certain
states
that
have
punitive
damage
situations,
that
may
be
up
to
the
trial
judge
in
terms...
and
in
an
adversary
situation
with
gillette
on
the
choice
of
law
relative
to
application;
or
if
it
becomes
unmanageable
because
of
those
great
differences,
if
there
are
such
great
differences,
then
they
may
have
to
be
subclasses.
but
we're
not
real
there
yet.
the
record
is
not
really
complete
yet
in
terms--
--well,
mr.
atkins,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
that
this
case
isn't
right
and
proceed
to
decide
it.
do
you
think
we
necessarily
reach
in
the
course
of
our
decision
the
question
of
whether
absent
class
members
would
be
bound
by
an
adverse
judgment
against
your...
against
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
really
up
to
illinois,
isn't
it?
