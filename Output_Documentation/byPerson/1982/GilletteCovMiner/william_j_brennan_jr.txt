william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
miller.
may
i
ask
at
the
outset,
do
we
know
that
that's
what
the
state
of
illinois
is
going
to
do
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
we
know
that?
there's
been
no...
no
determination
of
any
of
these
issues,
has
there?
what
i'm
getting
at,
do
we
really
have
a
final
judgment
yet
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
don't
know
whether
actually
a
class
will
be
certified
as
broadly
as
you
just
stated
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
whether
we
have
to
address
that
issue
until
we
find
out
that's
what
the
illinois
court's
going
to
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
with
the
case,
mr.
atkins?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
atkins,
do
i
get
your
position
clearly
that
if
there
are
any
due
process
rights
of
these
non-resident
class
members,
illinois
satisfies
them
simply
by
the
opt
out
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
else?
