justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
no
one
raised
the
final
judgment
question
at
the
certiorari
stage.
in
all
candor,
i
didn't
think
of
it
then,
and
i
have
thought
of
it
now;
so
i
don't
consider
myself
bound
by
the
four
votes
to
the
contrary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
difference
is
that
in
each
of
those
cases
the
entire
litigation
might
have
terminated
depending
on
how
this
court
decided
the
issue,
whereas
here
it
really
is
not
even
certain
that
there
will
be
a
class
any
broader
than
the
illinois
residents,
because
it's
theoretically
possible
that
a
judge
sitting
in
cook
county
might
decide
that
all
other
states
have
different
rules
or
they're
enough
different
that
he
doesn't
want
to
fuss
around
with
anything
except
an
illinois
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
agree
with
that,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
possible
that
the
trial
judge
could
say
well,
there
are
no
other
laws
quite
like
ours.
i
mean
we'd
have
to
do
some
research
to
find
out
whether
that's
plausible
or
not,
but
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
you
argue
on
the
merits,
this
case
is
the
most
extreme
that
has
arisen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
atkins,
do
you
get
to
the
settlement
posture
till
you
know
what
the
class
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
before
you
notify,
you've
got
to
certify
a
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you
send
out
a
notice
and
you
know
who
opts
out,
and
then
you
start
talking
settlement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
just
wondering,
you've
got
an
$8.10
claim
here.
at
least
that's...
as
i
understand
it,
that's
the
maximum...
you
seem
to
admit
that
in
your
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
true,
i'm
just
wondering
how
many
mailings
back
and
forth
you
can
afford
and
have
anything
left.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
maybe
they're
not
normally,
but
can
you
say
for
certain
that
they
would
not
be
in
a
particular
case?
say
in
this
particular
case
here
you
had
the
whole
class
certified,
and
then
the
case
went
along
for
a
while
and
you
found
out
that
the
rule
in
new
york
is
a
little
different,
and
all
the
new
york
lawyer...
all
the
new
york
purchasers
lose
because
they
couldn't
prove
that
they
actually
bought
the
material
instead
of
having
it
given
to
them
or
something
like
that,
who
would
pay
for
their
mailings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
perhaps...
what
i'm
suggesting
is
there
may
be
differences
that
don't
surface
at
the
outset.
at
the
time
of
the
certification
it
appears
that
the
laws
are
uniform,
and
then
in
a
long
case,
and
sometimes
cases
go
on
for
quite
a
while,
there's
a
decision
comes
out
in
new
york
that
clarifies
the
law
there,
and
you
find
out
there's
a
little
problem
in
new
york.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
the
reason
i
mention
those
examples,
what
is
the...
in
illinois
what
is
the
practice
with
respect
to
telling
a
person
who
has
a
decision
to
make,
shall
i
opt
out
or
not,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
might
be
subjected
or
costs
and
so
forth?
is
there
anything--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
it
settled
in
illinois
that
he
is
not
responsible
for
discovery
and
not
responsible
for
cost?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
interrupt
you
there,
mr.
atkins,
for
just
a...
it
would
be
unworkable
because
nobody's
apt
to
spend
20
cents
for
a
postage
stamp
to
opt
in
to
a
case
like
this
and
take
the
trouble
to
send
it
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
purposes
of
the
class
as
a
whole,
it's
better...
it's
kind
of
an
inertia.
people
don't
want
to
do
something
that
they're
not
quite
fully
under...
they
don't
understand
thoroughly.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
almost
zero
probability
of
anybody
opting
out
of
an
$8.00
claim
when
it
costs
you
about
50
cents
to
opt
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
it
almost
a
certainty
that
there
will
be
no
opt
outs
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it's
kind
of
a...
it's
almost
a
charade
in
a
way.
you're
in
effect
going
through
a
procedure
that
is
designed
to
give
people
a
choice
that
you
really
just
don't
believe
anybody's
going
to
make.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
little
different
if
it
was
a
$100,000
claim,
but
with
a
$7.00
or
$8.00
claim
to
say
do
you
want
to
spend
a
dollar
to
tell
us
whether
you
want
to
take
this
big
gamble
or
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they're
not
giving
up
very
much,
you're
saying.
if
they
lose
an
$8.00
claim,
who
cares?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
practical
assumption,
i
guess,
that
underlies
the...
the
approach
to
the
case
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
win.
that's
sort
of
the
basic
assumption
that
seems
to
be
made
in
these
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
there
have,
but
i'm
not
sure
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah,
well--
--perhaps
the
rule
should
be
changed
to
provide
that
there's
no
recovery
for
anyone
who
doesn't
affirmatively
opt
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
miller,
let
me
interrupt
you
on
that.
don't
you
think
that
the
binding
effect
of
the
judgment
might
be
affected
by
the
character
of
the
notice
that
goes
out?
supposing
they
sent
out
a
notice
saying
we've
got
just
the
title
of
the
case
and
do
you
want
to
opt
out,
or
supposing
on
the
other
hand
they
write
a
notice
that
says
you
might
get
stuck
with
costs,
you
might
have
to
respond
to
discovery,
your
maximum
recovery
is
$4.80,
and
the
lawyer
is
so
and
so.
it
seems
to
me
it
could
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
as
to
how--
