mr.
robert
s.
atkins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court:
i
still
believe,
notwithstanding
the
remarks
of
my
learned
colleague,
that
we
live
in
one
nation,
and
we
are
one
country,
and
we
have
many
states.
i
feel
compelled
to
say,
however,
that
there
was
an
air
of
divisiveness
that
i
gathered
from
professor
miller's
remarks;
and
i
think
that
if
it
was
adopted,
namely
that
there
be
a
reversal
of
the
illinois
supreme
court's
decision,
it
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
consumer
class
actions
which
i
think
have
been
encouraged,
certainly
as
indicated
in
the
snyder
case
by
this
court,
that
it
be
tried
in
the
state
courts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
snyder
case
it's
very
interesting.
it
was
a
multi-district
or
multi-state
class.
it
involved
state
law.
and
we
had
people,
4,000
shareholders,
and
they
lived
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states.
and
this
court
said
that
suits
involving
issues
of
state
law
are
brought
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
citizenship
can
often
be
most
appropriately
tried
in
state
court.
and
i
suggest
particularly
under
those
circumstances
and
with
the
court's
statement
in
standard
oil
in
terms
of
class
action
being
a
viable
mechanism
for
the
redress
of
these
kind
of
grievances
that
with
the
state
directly
at
the
present
time,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
state
of
illinois
should
not
be
reversed.
in
fact,
it
should
not
be
even
addressed
at
this
time;
because
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
are
two
very
important
reasons
why
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
should
not
be
addressed.
and
that
is
principally
on
the
basis
of
rightness
for
review
and
on
the
basis
of
standing.
and
with
respect
to
the
rightness
argument,
there's
been
no
deprivation
here.
what
has
been
deprived
at
the
present
time?
there's
been
no
class
certification.
there's
been
no
adverse
judgment.
there's
been
no
attempt
to
enforce
or
challenge
any
judgment.
what...
what
we
don't
even
know--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
this
court
should
dismiss
the
petition
as
improvidently
granted
and
leave
the
illinois
trial
court
to
determine
this
case,
move
on
with
this
case,
and
have
faith
and
reliance
in
its
state
court,
because
i
think
that
that's
where
it
belongs.
as
a
matter--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--i
suggest
that
with
respect
to...
it
may
be
a
final
judgment
with
respect
to
the
issue
before
the
illinois
supreme
court,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
right
for
review--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--of
the
issue
that
has
been
raised.
and
the
issue
raised
is
the
constitutional
issues,
which
as
justice
brandeis
has
indicated
in
ashwander,
that
the
court
should
be
particularly
reluctant
and
show
judicial
restraint
with
respect
to
getting
into
deciding
constitutional
issues.
and
the
issue
before
this
court
raised
by
the
petitioner
is
clearly
a
constitutional
issue.
and
it's
very
interesting
in
terms
of
the
type
of
case
that
we
have
here.
it's
a
class
action.
as
professor
miller
has
stated
in
one
of
his
numerous
articles,
he
indicated
that
class
actions,
almost
all
of
them
are
settled.
well,
if
almost
all
class
actions
are
settled,
i
submit
that
this
may
never
raise
its
head
with
respect
to
this
piece
of
litigation
because
it
may
be
disposed
of
and
disposed
of
appropriately
in
the
state
court.
i
suggest--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--i
think
it
would,
judge,
for
this
reason.
i
think
that
in
my
experience
in
class
action
litigation,
also
in
accordance
with
rule
23
in
the
statute
of
the
state
of
illinois,
for
any
settlement...
we'll
say
a
settlement
that
is
class-wide...
there
will
be
notice
given
in
terms
of
the
class
members,
and
they
will
have
an
opportunity
certainly
to
opt
out,
as
we
have
in
the
class.
if
it
is
disposed
of
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
terms
of
a
judicial
approval
of
a
settlement
as
being
fair
and
adequate
with
respect
to
the
class,
there
will
be
no
further
exposure
with
respect
to
those
persons
who
didn't
opt
out.
now,
when
we're
talking--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
the
people
who
could
file
their
own
lawsuit
in
their
own
state,
that
is
correct.
and
if
they
do,
i
would
classify
that
as
an
opt
out.
in
other
words,
i
would
think
that
they
are
still
hanging
there,
and
realistically
speaking,
gillette
would
have
to
make
an
accommodation
with
respect
to
those
people.
but
with
respect
to
the
798
claims
and
in
my
experience
with
respect
to
the
small
claim
class
actions,
that's
really
not
realistic.
and
we're
talking
about
a
rightness,
we're
talking
about...
we're
talking
about
the
possibility
of
conjecture
and
speculation
and
possible
future
harm.
and
i
don't
think
these
possibilities
and
i
don't
think
these
conjecture
matters
should
really
get
into
the
central
core
as
to
whether
or
not
this
issue
at
this
stage
is
right
for
review.
also
because,
as
this
court
knows,
there's
not
a
firm
factual
background
in
terms
of
determining
all
the
issues
in
this
situation.
and
so
i
think
that
it
is
not
right
for
review
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
no.
judge...
mr.
justice,
the
position
would
be
the
same.
the
position
is
that
there
is
a
mechanism,
a
class
mechanism
that
basically
disposes
in
federal
court
as
well
as
state
court
these
matters
through
settlement
in
most
of
the
cases,
and
whether
it's...
it
still
would
be
conjectural
in
terms
of
someone
coming
in
and
filing
their
own
action,
and
whether
it's
in
state
court
or
federal
court.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
we
get
to
the
settlement
posture,
judge,
in
my...
in
my
experience
at
the
time
that
we
do
notify,
which
sometimes
is
the
same
time.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's...
that's
pretty
close,
judge,
right.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
you've
put
your
finger
on
a
situation
where
the
number
in
a
class
are
important
from
an
economical
viewpoint
that
was
recognized
in
standard
oil.
and
we're
talking
about
a
$1.4
million
case
if
our
class
is
composed
of
everyone
who
didn't
get
their
lighters
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
we
are
in
state
court,
judge,
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
as
far
as
judiciary
concern,
i
suppose
that
if
you...
if
you
cheat
people
a
little
bit
but
do
it
a
lot
that
you
can
go
by
free.
the
position
of
the
consumer
fraud
statutes
and
class
actions
in
particular,
i
think,
your
honor,
is
to
provide
a
viable
mechanism
for
legal
redress.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
we
have
figured
that
out,
judge,
and
it's
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
over
$5.00.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
if
our
class
includes
everyone
who
does
not
opt
out,
then
it
would
apply
to
everyone
with
respect--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--there
is
administrative
expenses
and
there
are
judicial
expenses
that
go
into
any
class
action
litigation.
and
if
we
prevail
and
if
gillette
has
in
fact
deceived
180,000
people
who
were
in
our
class,
then
you're
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
no.
i
didn't
mean
that.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
yes.
i...
i
misspoke.
i
misspoke.
the
other
issue
that
is
very
important
that
we'd
like
to
address
is
the
standing
issue,
because
for
gillette
to
come
here...
and
i
think
that
professor
miller
has
admitted
today
that
he
is
asserting
the
rights
not
of
gillette
here,
but
he's
basically
asserting
the
rights
of
the
third
party,
absent
class
members.
and
as
indicated
in
the
case
of
singleton
v.
wulff,
the
court
will
try
to
determine
whether
or
not
someone
can
come
into
this
court
and
assert
the
constitutional
rights
of
third
parties,
because...
and
it's
a
very
interesting
and
important
observation...
that
it
may
well
be
that
these
parties
don't
want
to
assert
these
rights,
and
it
may
not
necessarily
even
come
up.
in
justice
powell
said
in
the
singleton
case
in
his
dissent,
that
it
must
be
a
practical
impossibility
for
it
to
be
raised
for
the
court
to
go
into.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
normally
in
my
experience
you
indicate
the
parameters
of
the
lawsuit
or
in
the
settlement,
what
the
terms
of
the
settlement.
that's
commonplace,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what
was
done.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
to
be
perfectly
fair
you
would
come
pretty
close
to
trying
to
tell
them
that,
because
the
judge--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--if
i
might
say,
because
just
as
was
brought
up
before,
lawyers'
expenses
in
the
case,
administrative
expenses
may
not
wholly
have
been
determined
at
this
juncture,
so
you
can't
wholly
note.
but
you
try
to
work
out
the
parameters
in
terms
of
letting
people
know
what
the
expenses
are
and
what
he
could
obtain
or
would
obtain
in
connection
with
the
lawsuit.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
it
depends
on
whether
there
is
claims
in
the
case
or
there
are
not
claims
in
the
case.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
in
an
opt
out
procedure
probably
not.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
one
of
the
things
that...
differences
in
terms
of
the
class
action
that
we
have
pointed
out
is
that
costs
are
not
normally
assessed
against
absent
class
members--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--i
think
that
you
have
again
addressed,
your
honor,
a
management
problem,
and
whether
or
not
they
even
should
be
certified;
because
if
there
are
certain
differences
with
respect
to
the
laws
of
an
individual
state,
these
are
some
of
the
problems
that
may
come
up
in
a
case
that--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--the
flexibility
of
a
class
action
device
would
be
able
to
permit
either
a
subclassing
with
respect
to
that
or
even
a
carving
out
with
respect
to
that
class.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
it's
been
my
observation
that
he
is
not
told
because
the
state
of
the
law
is
such
that
he
does
not
have
those
expenses.
now,
if
the
law
were
something
else,
i
suppose...
that's
not
our
case.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
it...
it...
in
the...
in
the
point...
one
more
point
with
respect
to
standing
which
i
think
is
important,
and
it
sort
of
puts
it
in
context;
and
that
is
that
the
absent
class
members,
whether
they're
in
iowa,
michigan,
california
or
arizona...
i
mean
if
they
thought
that
gillette,
who
as
many
of
them
may
not
know
had
deceived
them
with
respect
to
this
promotion,
was
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
arguing
that
their
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
because
of
the
lawsuit
that's
been
filed
by
a
similar
purchaser
in
the
same
position,
i
think
that
they
would
not
support
that
at
all.
i
don't
think
that
they
necessarily
would
want
gillette
championing
their
rights.
i
think
that
it's
important...
it's
almost
akin
to
the
fox
telling
the
farmer
that
he
would
be
a
good
protector
of
his
chickens.
i
mean
it's
just
not
sincere.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
standing
is
important
in
terms
of
bringing
this
to
the
court's
attention.
i'd
like
to
also
address
because
i
think
it's
important
the
type
of
due
process
considerations
going
beyond
the
standing
of
rightness
issue
which
mr.
miller
has
addressed.
and
i
think
the
central
issue
is
basically
whether
or
not
absent
class
members
would
receive
adequate
due
process,
not
merely
on
a
traditional
static,
ironclad
kind
of
conception
of
contacts
which
basically
relate
to
defendants,
because
we
have
a
different
kind
of
being
here.
and
their
whole
case,
if
i
may
suggest,
your
honors,
their
whole
case
seems
to
rest
on
the
fact
that
they
are
the
same;
that
defendants
in
the
case
are
the
same
as
absent
class
members.
and
they're
not.
we
discussed
the
discovery,
the
costs,
the
attorneys'
fees,
differences.
but
in
terms
of
the
judgment
itself,
the
term
that
in
a
judgment
defendant
must
pay,
what
he
faces,
what
a
defendant
faces
is
either
staying
away
and
having
default
judgment
against
you
or
coming
in
to
court
and
being
hauled
in
if
you're
from
a
faraway
forum,
hiring
a
lawyer
and
contesting
it.
and
in
international
shoe
and
other
cases
of
this
court
the
due
process
aspect
of
it
was
what
is
fair,
what
is
really
fair
for
a
defendant
who
faces
this
kind
of
coercive
judgment.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
that
that
particular
issue
with
respect
to
absent
class
members
had
not
been
adjudicated
before.
however,
what
i
was
trying
to
analogize
is...
is...
or
state
is
that
there
is
great
differences
between
defendants
and
absent
plaintiff
class
members
in
terms
of
the
coercive
effect
of
a
judgment,
for
example,
on
a
defendant
as
distinguished
from
what...
the
most
that
can
happen
as
far
as
an
absent
class
member
is
concerned
is
that
he
has
lost
his
opportunity
if
and
when
there
may
be
adjudication
against
him
to
contest
that
if
he
didn't
opt
out.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
i
think--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
what
professor
miller
is
saying
would
happen,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
we
don't
know
at
this
juncture.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
if
when
you
say
take
the
case
on
the
merits
in
terms
of
deciding
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
due
process
violation
because
of...
relative
to
the
absent
class
members,
and
you
decide
what,
your
honor...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
questions.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
i
think
that
they
would
be
bound
under
the...
under
the
illinois
decision.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
i
think
that
you
run
into
the
full
faith
and
credit
situation
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
illinois
court
making
a
decision
that...
that
would
affect
them.
the
illinois
statute
now
says
that
they
will
have
an
opportunity
to
opt
out,
the
mechanism,
and
i
think
with...
we
don't
reach...
we
don't
reach
that
decision...
we
don't
reach
that
decision,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
they
may.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
they
would
be
bound
under
the
illinois
decision
at
the
present
time.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
assuming...
assuming--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--that
we
go
through
the
adequate
representation
requirement
which
is
essential
to
the
due
process
in
a
class
action.
in
other
words,
if
they
had
the
adequate
representation,
the
question
is...
in
the
collateral
attack,
that's
when
it
would
come
into
play.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
they
can
tax
costs
against
the
represented
party.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
as
far
as
counsel's
concerned?
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
i'm
not
particularly
aware
of
that,
judge.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
for...
for...
under
certain
situations
which
i
suppose
are
gross
violations,
they
may
be
able
to.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's
my
understanding,
judge.
with
respect
to
the
opt
in
and
opt
out
procedure
that
was
brought
up,
we
believe
that
the
experience
with
rule
23
is
very
important,
because
in
rule
23
there's
a
specific
provision
with
respect
to
opting
out.
the
advisers,
the
adviser
committee
notes
the
commentators,
the
manual
of
multi-district
litigation
have
all
commented
on
the
requirement
of
an
opt
out
situation;
otherwise
it
would
be
destructive
to
class
actions.
we
feel
that
this
would
be...
it
would
be
unworkable
to
have
an
opt
in
situation.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
discretion--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--the
experience
has
been,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
commentators
as
well
as
the
courts,
in
the
manual
for
complex
litigation
we're
talking
about
federal
as
well
as
state,
that
it
would
not...
that
people
would
not
do
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
the
commentators...
professor
kaplan's
remarks
about
the
being...
the
timid,
the
people
who
would
not
do
anything,
came
to
play
in
terms
of
the
determination
to
put
that
requirement,
mandate
the
requirement
merely
an
opt
out
in
the
rule.
so
when
i
say
it's
unworkable,
unworkable
in
terms
of
the
purposes
to
be
effectuated
by
this.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
i
would...
i
would--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--i
would
have
to
go
along
with
that
assessment,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
i
think
because
the
flexible
standards
of
due
process
which
is
central
to
this
case,
that
also
has
to
be
put
into
the
mix
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
a
proposition
a
constitutional
law
is--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--well,
i...
i...
i
didn't
say
that.
i--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--i
say
that
it
should
work
for
all
people.
you
should
provide
mechanism.
i
mean
granted
in
a
small
case
the
person
is
not
going
to...
he
may
not
more
so
than
a
large
case.
but
it's
been
my
experience
in
the
large
cases
because
of
the
supervision
of
the
courts,
because
of
the
necessity
of
adequacy
of
representation
these
cases
are
settled
and
disposed
of,
and
there
are
few
opt
outs,
even
in
the
large
cases
where
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
are
due
and...
or
whose
attorneys
review
the
situation
or
the
settlement
albeit,
because
they've
reviewed
it
and
they
decide
that
they're
better
off
to
go
along
after
reviewing
it.
that
is
a
practical
answer
to
what
you
said.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
there
have
been
class
actions
where
plaintiffs
have
lost,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
i've
been
involved
in
them.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
that
changes
the...
what
you're
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
changing
rule
23
with
respect
to
the
federal
court
and
applying
those
to
states
or
the
entire
country.
i
would
suggest
that
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
manual,
in
professor
miller's
book,
in
rule
23,
it's
a
destructive
class
action
mechanism.
and
i
would
think
that
if
it's
going
to
work
in
terms
of
a
vehicle
to
redress
legal
grievances
for
small
claimants
that
the
opt
out
procedure
is
fair.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
absolutely,
absolutely.
absolutely,
justice.
and
illinois
has...
has...
legislature
has
decided
to
have...
to
put
into
operation
a
statute
that's
similar
to
rule
23
and
which
provides
an
opt
out
mechanism.
and
in
terms
of
the...
it...
it
supports
the
very
policy
of
class
actions.
and
i
should
say
this,
that
as
this
court
said
in
snyder
and
said
also
in...
in
the
standard
oil
case
in
hawaii
in
terms
of
support
of
class
actions,
in
terms
of
the
attorney
generals
who
believe
that
it's...
it's...
it's
a
necessary
deterrent
in
terms
of
a
problem
that
we
have
in
our
midst,
that
it's
no
time
to
turn
back
the
clock
in
terms
of
permitting
states
to
take
these
cases
that
are
meaningful
cases
and
shouldn't
be
in
federal
court
and
certainly
can't
be
in
federal
court
and
provide
some
legal
redress
for
the
grievances.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
not
simply,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
i
think
that
that's
part
of
it.
the
adequate
representation,
the
scrutiny
of
the
courts.
the
opt
out
procedure
complies
with
procedural
due
process.
rather
than
a
static
kind
of
mechanism
in
terms
of
no
minimum
contacts,
you're
out
of
court,
we
are
saying
let
the
illinois
courts
within
the
framework
of
an
illinois
statute,
within
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
relative
to
the
due
process,
let
this
thing
grow.
let
the
courts
of
illinois
or
the
courts
of
another
state
apply
their
mechanisms.
and
i
think
there
is
enough
protections
there
and
not
the
kind
of
bugaboos
and
conjectures
and
speculations
that
somehow
may
occur
to
the
interstate
system,
may
occur
to
some
other
states.
we
have
some
very
qualified
state
court
judges,
and
i
think
that
they
should
be
able
to
handle
these
matters.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
if...
are
you
talking
about
an
adjudication
or
are
you
talking
about
a
settlement,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
well,
gillette
could...
gillette
could
argue
the...
you're
talking
about
gillette's
arguing
their
own
due
process
rights?
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
the
double
liability
in
terms
of--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--in
the
collateral
estoppel
stage,
judge,
that
is
the
time
and
place
to...
to
raise
those
issues.
and
if...
if...
if
it's
to
be
enforced
or
challenged
with
respect
to
a
judgment
entered
in
illinois
court,
that's
the
time
to
challenge--
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
--i
don't
think
that
it
would
occur,
judge.
mr.
robert
s.
atkins
thank
you.
