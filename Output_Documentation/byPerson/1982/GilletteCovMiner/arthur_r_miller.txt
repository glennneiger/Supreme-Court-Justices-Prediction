mr.
arthur
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
illinois
can
assert
jurisdiction
over
more
than
168,000
citizens
of
every
state,
the
district
of
columbia,
puerto
rico
and
canada
when
those
people
have
had
no
contacts
with
illinois.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we
have
a
final
judgment
on
the
question
of
illinois'
capacity
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
non-resident
class
members
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
illinois
supreme
court
quite
clearly
and
unequivocally
held
that
the
international
shoe
test
established
by
this
court
is
inapplicable
to
non-resident
plaintiff
class
members.
in
that
sense
that
issue
is
final
at
this
time.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no.
the
one
issue
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
leaves
open
to
the
illinois
trial
court
is
the
question
of
manageability.
but
i
think
it's
reasonably
clear
given
the
directiveness
of
the
mandate
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
that
at
a
minimum
the
illinois
trial
court
will
certify
a
class
consisting
of
all
non-residents
whose
rights
arise
under
laws
that
they
would
deem
to
be
similar.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
it
is
inconceivable
to
me,
justice
brennan,
that
there
is
any
issue
left
open
with
regard
to
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
minimum
contacts
and
the
power
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
assert
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
there
has
been
a
mandate
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
the
illinois
trial
court
to
consider
this
question
of
manageability
under
the
laws
of
the
other
49
states
of
the
union.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
well,
i--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
think--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
think
you've
covered
all
the
possibilities
now.
[laughter]
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
let
me
simply
add
that
the
last
four
cases
that
this
court
has
heard
involving
questions
of
state
court
jurisdiction...
shaffer,
kulki,
woodson,
and
rush...
have
all
come
to
this
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes.
two
modest
addenda.
one
would
be
in
the
woodson
case
there
was
no
certainty
that
the
action
would
terminate
because
there
were
other
defendants
remaining
before
the
court.
second,
as
i
indicated
to
justice
brennan,
the
mandate
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
so
directive
that
the
illinois
trial
court
would
be
hard-pressed
to
dismiss
a
non-resident
subclass
of
those
people
coming
from
states
whose
laws
were
characterized
as
similar
to
the
illinois
consumer
protection
statute.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
it
is
theoretically
possible,
justice
stevens.
might
i
just
add
that
there
is
language
in
cox
broadcasting
v.
cohn
and
the
comparable
language
in
an
in-chambers
opinion
in
rosenblatt
v.
american
cyanimide
indicates
that
this
is
the
kind
of
question
where
the
issue,
this
issue,
this
central
issue
may
never
come
back
to
this
court,
and
you
have,
in
effect,
a
destabilized
situation.
in
cohn
you
will
recall
it
was
the
question
of
the
restraint
on
publication
in
georgia
of
a
rape
victim's
name.
the
supreme
court
in
that
case
felt
that
issue
was
important
enough
to
resolve
lest
it
not
come
back
and
leave
everyone
in
a
quandary.
i
think
as
one
looks
around
the
country
these
days,
one
finds
a
greater
and
greater
assertion
by
state
courts,
national
class
actions,
some
states
not
asserting
those
class
actions;
and
we
have
a
situation
in
which
a
good
many
judgments
are
potentially
unstable
and
subject
to
collateral
attack.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
absolutely.
i
think
this
case
is
extreme
because
there
is
undisputed
evidence
in
the
record
that
gillette
is
incorporated
in
delaware,
principal
place
of
business
is
in
massachusetts.
the
accent
table
lighter,
which
is
the
source
of
the
consumer
claim
in
this
case,
that
promotion
was
planned
and
executed
in
massachusetts.
all
receipts
of
applicants
for
the
promotion
were
handled
in
minnesota.
no
aspect--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--yes,
yes.
[laughter]
spotts
international,
a
promotional
processing
house,
is
located
in
minnesota.
so
gillette
gave
that
company
the
business
to
improve
the
employment
situation
in
that
state.
all
the
promotions
went
to
minnesota.
the
requests
for
the
accent
table
lighter
came
from
every
state
in
the
union,
puerto
rico,
the
district
of
columbia,
and
canada.
nothing
was
done
in
illinois
except
an
attempt
to
promote
responses
to
the
promotion
in
illinois.
only
11,465
of
those
who
did
not
get
the
table
lighter
came
from
illinois.
approximately
168,000
did
not
come
from
illinois,
have
no
contacts
from
illinois,
and
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
no.
the
class
is
frozen
now
because
the--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--the
promotion
has
ended.
four
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
applications--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
think
one
would
be
hard-pressed
to
make
that
claim
four
years
after
the
promotion.
the
promotion
took
place
in
1978.
again,
i
think
it's
unrealistic
that
anyone
else
will
come
out
of
the
woodwork.
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
class
actually
will
shrink
to
some
slight
degree
if
illinois
goes
forward
with
the
opt
out
option.
there
is
also
some
indication
that
certain
members
of
the
class
of
people
who
did
not
receive
the
lighter
feel
that
their
claims,
to
the
extent
that
they
even
thought
that
they
had
claims,
were
more
than
fairly
compromised
since
gillette
did
return
their
money,
did
send
a
letter
of
explanation,
and
did
send
them
a
free
cricket
lighter.
indeed--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--this
court
in
hanson
and
denckla
allowed
florida
defendants
to
assert
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
a
delaware
trustee.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
it
was.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
with
great
deference,
i
would
argue
that
there
are
very
few
people
more
indispensable
to
an
action
than
the
plaintiffs.
we
are
talking
about
168,000
involuntary,
nonvolitional
plaintiffs
who
have
not
indicated
to
any
degree
that
they
are
interested
in
pursuing
this
claim.
the
problem
for
gillette
from
a
standing
perspective
is
that
if
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion
is
allowed
to
stand,
it
will
be
subjected
to
the
claims
of
these
168,000
nonvolitional
plaintiffs
in
illinois
in
what
i
think
must
be
characterized
as
a
frighteningly
monstrous,
in
complexity
terms,
lawsuit
followed
by
a
judgment
that
has,
unless
this
court
speaks,
extremely
dubious
full
faith
and
credit
implications.
we
are
now
in
the
position
of
looking
at
the
168,000
nonvolitional
plaintiffs
and
realizing
they
have
no
incentive
to
come
forward
at
this
time.
pragmatically
they
have
not
received
notice.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
they
will
be
given
notice.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
but
if
i
might
just
pursue
the
standing
point
for
a
moment,
they
have
no
notice
at
this
point.
they
will
not
get
notice
until
some
time
after
jurisdiction
is
or
isn't
established.
they
have
very
little
incentive
to
come
in.
number
one,
their
claims
are
only
for
$7.95
apiece.
and
number
three,
they're
in
a
heads-i-win/tails-you-lose
situation;
because
if
they
remain
on
the
outside
of
the
action
and
the
case
goes
to
judgment
and
the
class
prevails,
they
can
take
advantage
of
it.
but
should
gillette
prevail
on
the
merits,
they
can
then
make
the
very
argument
that
we
are
making
at
this
point.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
yes.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
do
not
think
that
is
as
clear.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
they
can
opt
out,
but
if
they
opt
out,
my
understanding
of
the
illinois
opt
out
law
is
that
they
cannot
then
take
advantage
if
they
opt
out.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
it's
very
hard
to
speak
to
that
issue
at
this
point.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
fact
remains,
justice
white,
that
the
theory
of
the
hanson
and
denckla
standing
point
is
equally
applicable
in
this
situation
because
those
florida
defendants
were
making
exactly
the
same
point
with
regard
to
that
indispensable
delaware
trustees:
unless
you
get
him
in
now
or
determine
that
he
can't
be
brought
in
now,
we
are
subjected
to
this
litigation
and
a
threat
of
second
litigation.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
in
its
own
behalf,
no.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
you
are
right.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
in
the
illinois
court,
yes.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
a
group
of
plaintiffs
volitionally
can
accede
or
consent
or
seek
out
the
jurisdiction
of
the
illinois
courts.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
think
if
the
state
of
illinois
chose
to
pursue
its
consumer
protection
policy
by
enacting
a
statute
that
provided
a
mechanism
of
inviting
non-resident
class
members
to
opt
in
to
an
illinois
action,
that
would
be
constitutional.
what
it
seems
to
gillette
offends
the
constitution
is
the
attempt
by
the
state
of
illinois
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
a
group
of
people
who
have
not
manifested
any
acquiescence
in
illinois
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
think
what
this
court
has
decided
in
an
unbroken
line
of
cases
from
international
shoe
is
that
in
the
absence
of
minimum
contacts
between
a
state
and
a
party,
that
state
cannot
assert
jurisdiction
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
yes,
except
conceivably
the
mullane
case.
this
court
last
year
in
logan
v.
zimmerman
brush
clearly
stated
that
a
cause
of
action
is
a
property
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
draw
a
distinction
between
holding
a
defendant
liable
for
$7.95
and
issuing
a
decree
or
a
judgment
that
forecloses
a
plaintiff
from
asserting
a
claim
for
$7.95.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
basically
the
issue
that
was
before
this
court
in
mullane
v.
central
hanover
bank
and
trust
company
where
at
issue
were
the
claims
by
a
variety
of
non-new
york
trust
beneficiaries
with
regard
to
the
settlement
of
a
new
york
trustee's
accounts.
and
justice
jackson
writing
for
the
court
in
that
case
made
it
very
clear
that
he
was
quite
concerned
from
a
jurisdictional
perspective
about
the
foreclosure
effect
on
those
beneficiaries
of
not
being
able
to
charge
the
new
york
trustee
with
fraud
or
mismanagement
or
excessive
fees.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
a
little
different...
indeed,
it
is
not
different...
from
any
attempt
by
say
gillette--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--no,
i
do
not.
again--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
think
that
is
right,
but
i
think
the
court's
opinions,
particularly
the
last
four
opinions,
have
been
absolutely
clear
in
drawing
distinctions
between
three
elements...
among
three
elements
of
due
process:
jurisdiction,
notice,
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
respondents,
and
i
fear
the
illinois
supreme
court,
have
simply
made
it
appear
as
if
there
were
only
requirements
of
notice
and
opt
out
or
opt--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--i
do
not
see
how
the
state
of
illinois
could
bind
that
person.
this
court's
opinion--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--the
author
of
insurance
corporation
of
ireland
one
year
ago
said--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--made
it
very
clear
that
an
individual
who
feels
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
tribunal
may
simply
ignore
the
proceedings.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
he
does
so
at
some
risk,
but
not
much
risk
if
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i
do
not
see
how
the
state
of
illinois
can
write
me
a
letter
in
massachusetts
and
say
"hi,
this
is
notice
we
have
an
action
going.
"
"you
have
the
privilege--
"
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--that's
right.
that
is
not
the
purposeful
availing
that
the
court
has
spoken
of.
that
is
not
a
contact
or
tie
or
relation
with
a
forum.
that
is
a
unilateral
act
by
a
third
person.
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
notice,
opt
out,
or
even
adequacy
of
representation
can
constitutionally
fill
the
gap.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
is
one
of
the
many,
many
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court
that
are
in
appearance
multi-state
class
actions;
but
when
one
looks
at
the
facts
of
each
and
every
one
of
those
cases,
each
and
every
one
of
them,
one
discovers
that
either
there's
a
clear
satisfaction
of
minimum
contacts
or
there
is
an
entity
created
by
the
forum,
which
decisions
as
far
back
as
pennoyer
and
neff
make
clear
the
forum
can
adjudicate
and
make
decisions
about
rights
and
liabilities,
or
there's
a
fear
that
there
will
be
conflicting
judgments
resulting
from
sequential
actions.
in
other
words,
it
is
either
a
res,
an
entity,
a
set
of
minimum
contacts,
an
organization
created
by
the
forum,
or
a
very
palpable
fear
of
conflicting
judgments.
in
this
case
you
have
nothing
but
168,000
people
with
completely
undifferentiated
and
individualized
damage
claims,
with
no
contacts,
no
basis,
no
legitimate
interest
in
the
state
of
illinois
to
regulate,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
and
we're
assuming
diversity
of
citizenship
jurisdiction.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
under
the
decisions
of
all
of
the
circuits,
according
to
language
in
the
insurance
corporation
of
ireland
case,
the
existing
jurisprudence
under
the
irian-thompkins
doctrine
strongly
suggests
that
a
state-city-university
has
no
further
jurisdictional
reach
than
the
courts
of
the
state
in
which
it's
in.
indeed,
your
reference
to
a
$10,000
claim
i
think
very
graphically
shows
what
the
threat
to
federalism
is
in
this
case.
after
all,
the
proposition
that
a
non-resident
without
contacts,
without
acquiescence
is
free
to
litigate
in
his
home
forum
before
a
tribunal
that
is
constituted
by
political
forces
responsive
to
him,
a
tribunal
that
understands
the
social
fabric
of
the
law
it's
to
be
applying,
a
tribunal
that
has
a
direct
and
substantial
interest
not
only
in
applying
the
law
but
applying
it
correctly,
the
whole
theory
there
is
first
the
fairness
to
that
individual
litigant,
his
right
to
claim
the
forum
of
his
state;
and
second,
to
make
sure,
as
justice
white
remarked
in
the
woodson
case,
that
the
states
recognize
that
they
are
co-equal
sovereigns
in
a
federal
system.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
is
correct.
let
me
just
pursue
the
federalism
point,
because
i
think
it
really
is
central
to
this
case.
the
fears
that
one
perceives
of
allowing
illinois
to
collectivize
168,000
cases,
even
though
they
have
not
been
asserted
by
the
individual
holders
of
those
claims,
is
first
there
is
a
substantial
risk
that
this
will
allow
cases
to
be
tried
in
the
wrong
place.
if
you
go
back
to
cases
like
mullane
and
ibbs,
indeed
all
of
the
cases
cited
in
respondent's
brief,
you
have
a
forum
with
a
significant
interest
in
the
dispute
because
it
created
the
entity.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
with
deference,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it's
most
prudential
to
maintain
the
unbroken
line
of
minimum
contacts
cases,
because
that
way
and
only
that
way
are
you
likely
to
get
states
respecting
each
other
in
terms
of
jurisdictional
acquisition.
and
with
great
trepidation
i
suggest
to
you
that
given
the
court's
approach
to
state
choice
of
law,
it
is
now
only
through
the
maintenance
of
the
jurisdiction
principle
under
shoe
that
this
court
can
guard
against
questionable,
indeed
potentially
abusive
applications
of
state
law.
because
in
a
situation
in
which
you
have
no
jurisdictional
standing...
and
that
is
what
the
respondent
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
have
decided...
in
a
situation
in
which
you
have
no
jurisdictional
standing,
where
illinois
can
take
jurisdiction
because
it
means
well,
then
you
have
the
spectre
of
cases
being
tried
in
the
wrong
fora,
not
the
fora
where
the
contacts
are
significant,
indeed
overpowering,
like
ibbs
and
mullane
and
hansberry.
you
also
run
the
risk
that
that
forum
court
being
subjected
to
the
normal
pressures
of
judicial
administration
will
have
a
great
tendency
to
apply
its
own
law,
thereby
violating
the
individual's
constitutional
right
to
have
his
property,
her
property,
his
claim,
her
claim
adjudicated
by
a
local
forum
under
local
law
by
a
local
judge
before
a
local
jury,
unless
that
person
manifests
a
willingness
to
accede
to
the
jurisdictional
power
of
another
state.
it
seems
to
me
that
must
mean...
that
must
be
what
this
court
means
when
it
persists
in
the
notion
that
the
states
are
co-equal
sovereigns,
that
territorial
boundaries
have
not
been
eliminated
in
this
country,
that
each
of
the
states
must
acknowledge
and
respect
the
rights
of
the
other
members
of
the
polity.
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
as
of
this
moment
the
illinois
decision
on
all
federal
questions
is
final.
the
only
thing
left
open
for
illinois
at
this
judgment
are
illinois
state
issues.
and
as
this
bench
knows--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--it
can,
your
honor,
but
let
me
back
up.
there
are
at
least
three
levels
of
potential
collateral
attack
that
gillette
must
face
unless
this
issue
is
resolved,
and
i
think
this
may
tie
to
some
of
the
thoughts
justice
white
was
expressing.
first,
if
you
do
not
decide
this
question
now,
people
will
collaterally
attack
this
judgment
on
the
basis
of
a
lack
of
personal
jurisdiction.
second,
no
matter
what
you
decide
in
terms
of
the
power
of
illinois
to
go
forward
in
this
action,
although
that
may
prevent
collateral
attack
on
the
personal
jurisdiction
point,
it
will
not
prevent
collateral
attack
if
illinois
goes
forward
on
adequacy
of
representation
grounds,
hansberry
and
lee.
and
third,
your
honor,
your
very
point,
there's
always
the
potential
for
collateral
attack
on
a
state
court
judgment
based
on
inadequate
notice.
that
is
why
we
believe
we
have
standing
in
this
case.
in
hanson
and
denckla
those
were
the
very
threats
facing
the
florida
defendants
and
why
they
said
unless
you
decide
the
question
of
jurisdiction
over
that
delaware
trustee,
we
are
threatened
by
the
potential
for
collateral
attack
down
the
line.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
those
are
gillette's
own
concerns.
i
believe
my
learned
colleague
may
have
slightly
mistook
our
argument,
which
is
not
necessarily
a
third
party
standing
or
surrogate
standing
argument;
that
is
our
concern
under
hanson
and
denckla.
i
believe,
by
the
way,
that
the
third
party
standing
argument
is
available
to
us
since
that
has
always
been
a
rule
of
prudential
administration.
and
i
think
it's
abundantly
clear
first
that
we
are
injured
by
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction
in
illinois;
and
second,
that
it
is
extraordinarily
improbable
that
the
third
party
is
going
to
come
in
and
assert
the
points
that
we
are
asserting
at
this
juncture.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
under
the
illinois
consumer
protection
statute
the
prevailing
party
secures
costs.
there
are
no
opinions
as
yet
whether
that
would
embrace
the
ability
to
assess
costs
over
a
non-formal
party
class
member.
i
think
justice
stevens
was
getting
at
the
enormous
potential
difficulties
in
choice
of
law
problems
here
for
any
court
that
seeks
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
non-resident,
nonvolitional
class
members
and
then
purports
to
apply
the
legal
rules
of
the
other
states.
which
legal
rules?
the
fee
rules?
the
prevailing
attorney
fee
rules?
or
such
rules
as
are
now
common
in
a
state
like
my
own,
massachusetts.
in
massachusetts
a
consumer
who
feels
aggrieved
under
the
massachusetts
statute
must
write
a
letter
to
the
company.
the
company
is
given
30
days
to
make
a
reasonable
offer
of
settlement.
if
the
reasonable
offer
of
settlement
is
rejected
and
the
case
proceeds
to
trial
and
the
consumer
does
not
prevail
to
the
settlement
point,
there's
no
liability
for
costs
or
fees.
now,
is
the
state
of
illinois
going
to
apply
that
principle,
or
is
the
major
consumer
policy
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts...
and
i
could
lists
dozens
of
comparable
illustrations...
simply
going
to
be
ignored
as
the
state
of
illinois
plays
pacman
with
its
little
electronic
monster
going
around
the
screen
gobbling
up
$7.95
claims
saying
oh,
they're
just
dots,
they're
just
dots;
because
that
really
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case:
whether
consistent
with
interstate
federalism
you
will
allow
a
court
with
no
contacts
to
do
that.
thank
you.
