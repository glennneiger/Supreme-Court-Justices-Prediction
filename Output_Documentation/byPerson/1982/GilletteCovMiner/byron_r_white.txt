justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
class
action?
has
there
been
an
order
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
one
of
your
answers,
mr.
miller,
might
be
that
the
court
granted
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
long
as
four
want
it
granted,
they're
supposed
to
decide
it
on
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
full
four
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
class...
is
the
class
frozen
in
any
sense
now?
it
might
be
268,000
before
you
get
through.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
those
who
would
claim
they
would
have
applied
but
for
some
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
a
typical
class
action
suit.
it
may
not
be...
i
suppose
you
would
say
they
could
have
a
class
action
of
all
illinois
residents.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would...
the
same
thing
would
be
true
of
all
of
those
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
can
opt
out
and
take
advantage
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
gillette
would
really,
if
it
lost
the
case,
really
defend
against
another
party
in
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
think
it's
hard
to
speak
to
it
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
mr.
miller,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
gillette
raises
no
minimum
contacts
constitutional
arguments
in
its
own
behalf?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
miller,
after
all,
there
would
be
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
opt
out.
and
failing
to
opt
out
you
think
isn't
equivalent
to
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'd
certainly
have
to
say
that
because
you
have
just
said
that
if
there
was
consent,
if
they
voluntarily
came
into
illinois,
it
would
be
quite
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
was
proof
that
a
person
hadn't...
a
person
had
notice,
and
he
decided
not
to
opt
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
say...
he
could
sit
right
there
and
say
well,
if
it
turns
out
well,
that's
fine;
if
it
turns
out
bad,
i'll
sue
him
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
would
get
to
that.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can't
bind
him
just
by
his
failing
to
object.
justice
byron
r.
white
either
speak
up
or
be
stuck.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you...
do
you
suggest
there's
not
a
final
judgment
or
just
that
we
should
dismiss
it
as
improvidently
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
enclose
a
return
envelope
with
a
stamp
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you're...
you're
circulating
a
class
of
plaintiffs
with
an
$8.00
claim
do
you
put
in
a
return
envelope
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
going
to
cost
him
a
few
cents
anyway
to
opt
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
twenty
cents.
i
said
a
few.
justice
byron
r.
white
f-e-w.
may
i
also
ask,
does
the
notice
customarily
in
illinois
class
actions
discuss
whether
or
not
the
class
members,
a)
might
be
subjected
to
discovery,
and
b)
might
have
to
pay
some
costs?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
case...
suppose
the...
the...
suppose
the
case
goes
to...
goes
to
trial
and
there's
a
judgment
against
the
class,
a
judgment
in
favor
of
gillette.
now,
would
the
binding
nature
of
that
judgment
against
absent
class
members,
is
it...
is
that
an
issue
before
us
if
we
reach
the
merits
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we...
is
part
of
our
deciding
whether
there's
a
denial
of
due
process
the
question
of...
is
part
of
that
question
whether
or
not
absent
class
members
would
be
bound.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
wouldn't
be,
would
there
be
a
denial
of
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
wondering,
perhaps
gillette
would
win
no
matter
how
this
case
comes
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
if
we
decided
that
there's
no
denial
of
due
process
because
the
absent
class
members
would
be
bound,
then
they
wouldn't
be
subjected
to
the
possibility
of
double
judgments.
that
certainly
wouldn't
hurt
them
too
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there's
no
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
suggest,
would
you,
that...
that
illinois
consistently
with
the
constitution
could
require
gillette
to
pay
$8.00
times
168,000
in
the
court
for
distribution
among
class
members,
and
at
the
same
time
concede
that
many
of
those
members
who
did
not
opt
out
would
not
be
bound?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
talking
about
an
adjudication.
if
they
require...
if
the
judgment
requires
gillette
to
pay
in
a
certain
amount
of
money
for
168,000
people,
that's
on
the
premise
that
everybody
who
didn't
opt
out
would
be
bound.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
that's
wrong,
gillette,
it
seems
to
me,
has
some
due
process
claim
of
its
own,
not
just
for
absent
class
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
double
liability.
double
jeopardy.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
double
jeopardy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
in
the
other...
in
the
other
jurisdiction
it's
going
to
be...
in
the
other
jurisdiction
the
claim
is
going
to
be
there
wasn't
any
jurisdiction
in
the
illinois
court
to
bind
me,
none
at
all.
and
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
it's
a
very
agreeable
result
if
the
defendant
has
to
pay
twice
to
the
same
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
--those
are
gillette's
own
concerns.
