mr.
david
bonderman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ten
years
ago
today,
in
fact
virtually
at
this
hour,
petitioner
dirks
was
in
the
office
of
stanley
goldblum,
chairman
of
the
board,
president,
and
chief
executive
officer
of
then
high
flying
equity
funding
corporation
of
america.
justice
white,
it
was
at
10:00
in
the
morning,
california
time.
[laughter]
mr.
dirks
was
there
to
confront
mr.
goldblum
with
uncorroborated
allegations
of
a
former
officer...
a
fired
former
officer
of
a
subsidiary
to
the
effect
in
relevant
part
that
the
major
foundations
of
the
company,
its
life
insurance
subsidiary,
were
a
fraud
and
that
the
company
was
carrying
on
its
books
substantial
amounts
of
"phony
policies"
which
were
being
sold
to
reinsurers
as
though
they
were
real
in
a
ponzi
scheme.
mr.
goldblum,
of
course,
denied
all,
arranged
for
a
meeting
which
lasted
much
of
the
day
with
all
of
the
other
major
officers
of
the
company
in
an
endeavor
to
persuade
mr.
dirks
that
these
allegations
were
entirely
spurious
and
were
being
circulated
by
a
disgruntled
former
fired
employee
who,
although
mr.
dirks
hadn't
mentioned
his
name,
mr.
goldblum
knew
who
it
was.
secrist
had
come
to
dirks
ten
days
earlier
with
these
and
other
allegations,
some
of
which
ultimately
proved
to
be
true,
some
of
which
proved
to
be
false.
he
had
come
to
dirks
because
dirks
had
a
reputation
as
an
analyst
who
was
willing
to
investigate
beyond
just
looking
at
reports,
the
bottom
line
financial
analysis,
because
as
the
court
of
appeal
below
found
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
had
a
history
of
failing
to
act
promptly
in
dealing
with
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
equity
funding
scandal,
the
sec
having
been
informed
by
one
of
its
own
former
attorneys
a
year
and
a
half
earlier
and
having
taken
essentially
no
action,
a
quick
investigation
which
was
closed.
the
sec
again
being
informed
within
two
days
of
mr.
dirks,
but
again
concluding
that
there
was
nothing
there
and
not
taking
any
action
at
that
time.
secrist
had
the
idea
that
in
view
of
the
performance
by
the
regulators
and
in
view
of
the
notion
within
the
company
that
the
company
had
connections
through
its
associate
general
counsel
to
the
sec,
which
made
it
clear
that
the
sec
would
never
act,
and
through
its
vice
president
of
the
illinois
insurance
commission,
which
also
assured
that
the
insurance
commission
which
had
regulatory
authority
would
never
act,
the
only
way
to
public's
eyes
what
secrist
believed,
though,
as
he
admitted
he
had
no
proof,
was
a
major,
perhaps
the
major
fraud
in
corporate
america
at
the
time
was
to
have
somebody
like
dirks
go
out,
do
such
investigation
as
he
could
and
to
publicize
those
allegations
in
the
only
way
a
securities
analyst
can
by
telling
everybody
he
can
get
his
hands
on
with
the
result
that
the
trading
in
the
stock
would
cause
an
adjustment
in
the
price--
mr.
david
bonderman
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
from
the
7th
of
march
until
the
26th
of
march.
mr.
david
bonderman
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
second
one
if
i
might.
the
second
one
is
that
the
sec's
position
is
that
even
if
he
had
he
would
have
violated
the
law
because
it
is
no
defense
that
you
reported
it
to
the
sec--
mr.
david
bonderman
--that
brings
me
to
what
i
suppose,
perhaps,
should
have
been
my
first.
it
was
reported
to
dirks
by
mr.
secrist
that
the
sec
was
aware
and
had
been
informed
in
1971.
that
was
correct.
the
courts
below
so
found--
mr.
david
bonderman
--well,
the
answer
to
that
is,
i
would
say
first,
if
he
has
an
obligation
to
go
to
the
sec
at
all--
mr.
david
bonderman
--i
believe
not,
but
i
believe
that
that
is
not
material
here
because
under
the
facts
present
what
he
had
was
a
rumor,
an
unverified
allegation,
perhaps
more
than
a
rumor,
but
certainly
less
than
fact,
of
the
sort
that
goes
on
in
the
market
all
the
time.
in
fact,
stanley
sporkin,
the
head
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission's
division
of
enforcement
at
the
time,
who
was
called
before
congress
and
asked
why
was
it
that
the
sec
didn't
take
action
when
dirks
did
go
there
on
the
26th--
mr.
david
bonderman
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no
because
i
believe
that
mr.
dirks
did,
in
fact,
go
to
the
sec
himself
although
secrist
told
him
on
the
19th
of
march
that
secrist
had
gone
to
the
sec...
that
turned
out
to
be
inaccurate.
indirectly
the
information
was
brought
to
the
sec's
attention
on
the
9th...
i
believe
that
the
record
here
is
clear
that
mr.
dirks
went
to
the
sec
on
the
26th
at
the
very
first
time,
certainly
the
very
first
working
day,
that
he
had
anything
beyond
speculation
allegation.
after
he
had
checked
it
out,
he
and
mr.
blundell
from
the
wall
street
journal,
who
was,
in
fact,
the
first
person
that
mr.
dirks
talked
to,
did,
in
fact,
go
to
the
sec.
i
might
add
that
mr.
dirks
had
a
very
personal
additional
reason
for
not
going
to
the
sec
because
the
last
time
he
was
involved
in
an
investigation,
he
had
done
just
what
you
suggest.
some
clients
of
his...
this
involved
a
prior
case,
the
itt
hartford--
mr.
david
bonderman
--yes
it
is.
it
is
in
the
record.
mr.
dirks
in
that
case
had
gone
to
the
sec
because
he
heard
from
some
of
his
clients
that
insider
trading
was
going
on,
and
he
went
to
the
sec
and
told
them
requesting
that
they
please
keep
his
name
out
of
it
because
his
clients
would
not
appreciate
his
sharing
their
confidences
with
the
sec.
the
first
thing
the
sec
did
was
call
up
the
clients
and
said,
dirks
here
is
alleging
that
you
know
thus
and
such
about
inside
information
and
inside
trading
in
the
hartford
case.
needless
to
say,
mr.
dirks
himself
was
personally
disencouraged
because
of
that
experience
for
going
to
the
sec
before
he
believed
he
had
facts,
which
he
did
not
have,
we
believe.
mr.
david
bonderman
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
in
part,
yes,
although
what
the
commission
really
found
was
at
least
and
the
administrator
alleges
the
same
thing...
at
least,
forgetting
what
happened
earlier
on,
at
least
by
the
weekend
between
the
23rd
and
26th
he
had
such
information.
in
fact,
the
information
that
dirks
had
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
mr.
sporkin
on
a
telephone
call
by
mr.
blundel
of
the
wall
street
journal
on
the
evening
of
the
23rd
of
march
which
happened
to
have
been
a
friday.
dirks
came
in
and
testified
starting
on
the
following
monday,
the
26th,
testified
for
three
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
mr.
sporkin
testified
before
congress
that
the
sec
had
nothing
but
hearsay,
innuendo
and
rumor,
and
nothing
on
which
it
could
act.
that
was
the
sec's
position
and
testimony
before
congress
about
what
dirks
knew.
that
is
after
dirks
spent
three
days
telling
them.
i
would
like
to
talk
about--
mr.
david
bonderman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
bonderman
the
answer
to
both
questions
is,
as
far
as
i
know,
there
are
none.
mr.
david
bonderman
i
believe
they
do.
in
fact,
you
raise
a
very
good
point
because
when
dirks
started
to
make
his
checks
in
the
industry
and
ask
people,
look,
you
know
how
reinsurers
operate,
is
this
scheme
possible,
because
it
made
no
sense.
it
was
ponzi
scheme.
is
this
scheme
possible.
he
was
cautioned,
don't
say
anything
to
anybody.
you
are
going
to
get
yourself
in
trouble.
there
are
libel
laws
here.
you
be
very
cautious
about
what
you
say.
so,
the
truth
is
that
you
are
caught
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
in
the
sense
that
an
analyst
like
dirks
has
no
access
to
the
press.
he
went
to
the
wall
street
journal.
that
was
the
first
thing
he
did.
they
declined
to
print
the
story.
the
testimony
was
that
they
cannot
print
a
story
on
hearsay
allegations.
they
did
not
act
on
it,
though
they
worked
with
dirks,
and
ultimately
based
on
the
information
that
dirks
uncovered
printed
a
story
after
the
period
of
time
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
david
bonderman
well--
mr.
david
bonderman
--one
of
the
defenses
raised
by
the
persons
to
whom
dirks
gave
information
and
who
traded...
and
let
me
just
regress
for
a
second
to
say,
dirks
told
literally
a
hundred
people
about
this,
some
of
whom
bought,
some
of
whom
sold,
some
of
whom
did
neither.
some
of
those...
five
of
those
persons
who
sold
were
charged
in
this
proceeding
below,
and
they
defended
themselves,
in
part,
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
caught
with
two
fiduciary
obligations,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
this
was
inside
information,
which
i
do
not
believe
for
a
moment
it
is.
they
had
two
fiduciary
obligations.
one
to
their
clients,
pension
funds
for
example,
for
whom
they
were
trustee.
information
comes
to
them.
they
have
an
obligation
to
act
for
those
trustees,
and
they
have
an
obligation
not
to
violate
the
law
with
respect
to
this
information.
the
courts
below,
or
this
commission
because
it
never
got
to
the
court
below,
held
that
whatever
your
other
fiduciary
obligations
are,
it
gives
you
no
license
to
violate
these
laws.
i
think
the
question
is
an
open
one.
it
was
decided
by
the
administrative
law
judge,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
further
decisions
on
that
point.
what
happens
here
if
we
think
about
the
public
policy
implications
of
what
was
done,
and,
indeed,
why
the
solicitor
general
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
criminal
division
filed
a
brief
urging
reversal,
is
that
as
one
commentator
put
it,
you
have
here
the
biggest
boon
for
the
successful
commission
and
continuation
of
fraud
that
can
be
imagined
because
what
you
have
done
to
somebody
in
dirks'
position
is
to
tell
him
that
the
only
thing
he
can
do
without
risking
a
securities
violation
is
to
do
what
counsel
suggested
below,
nothing.
that
is
to
say
to
be
silent.
why
do
i
say
that?
because
you
will
recall
that
dirks
himself
did
not
trade.
he
did
not
own
any
stock.
neither
he
nor
his
company
traded
a
single
share.
what
he
did
was
tell
everybody
he
could
get
his
hands
on,
which
included
the
auditors,
which
included
the
wall
street
journal,
which
included
a
whole
series
of
persons
in
the
securities
business,
large
and
small,
as
the
sec
found.
he
basically
responded
to
other
people's
calls.
mr.
david
bonderman
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
i
think
there
is
an
argument
that
they
could,
and
i
think
there
is
an
argument
that
they
could
not.
mr.
david
bonderman
my
position
is
that
if
those
members
of
the
court
in
chiarella
who
expressed
the
view
that
misappropriation
of
information
is
grounds
under
10b-5
and
17(a)
for
violation,
and
the
information
came
to
dirks
on
the
theory
that
he
was
going
to
disseminate
it.
if
he
instead
used
it
solely
for
his
own
private
trading,
it
might
be
argued
that
he
misappropriated
it.
i
think
that
is
wrong,
but
i
think
a
substantial
argument
can
be
made
based
on
that
branch
of
chiarella.
i
think
there
is
no
argument
that
can
be
made,
no
reasonable
argument
that
can
be
made,
that
where
secrist
reasonably
concluded
that
the
only
way
to
get
this
out
in
view
of
what
secrist
understood
to
be
the
sec's
defaults
in
investigating,
and
which
the
court
below
found
to
the
sec's
defaults
in
investigating
it,
the
only
way
to
get
this
out
was
to
do
what
dirks
did.
dirks
did
not
trade,
but
did
get
it
out.
there
is
no
grounds
under
chiarella
to
find
that
any
person
breached
any
duty
to
any
one.
mr.
david
bonderman
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
probably
yes.
mr.
david
bonderman
that
is
correct.
the
reason
that
he
is
not
liable
here
is
because
under
no
conceivable
definition
of
the
term,
insider
information,
as
that
has
been
used,
inside
information,
could
this
possibly
be
inside
information.
that
is
what
the
sec
forgot
here.
they
made
the
incredible...
and
i
think
it
is...
incredible
statement
as
the
underlying
basis
for
their
rationale
in
this
case
that
dirks
should
have
known
that
this
information
was
intended
by
the
company
to
remain
confidential.
indeed,
it
was.
nobody
who
is
committing
a
fraud
desires
to
have
it
circulated.
but,
yet
that
is
the
foundation
for
the
whole
insider
trading
rules
and
regulations
stemming
from
investors
management,
the
notion
of
improper
dissemination.
there
was
nothing
improper
about
what
mr.
secrist
chose
to
do.
he
had
two
choices
as
a
fiduciary.
the
fraud
was
going
on.
he
could
do
either
of
two
things.
he
could,
as
the
commission
suggests
he
should
have,
done
nothing
whatsoever
and
allowed
it
to
continue.
instead,
he
chose
to
follow
a
path
which
lead
to
its
disclosure
sooner
rather
than
later.
and,
that
is
because,
and
it
is
a
proven
fact
in
this
case,
so
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
reporting
this
information
to
public
officials
got
nowhere
in
the
past.
that
isn't
and
should
not
come
to
anybody
as
a
shock,
although
this
case
is
a
little
more
egregious
as
to
what
it
is
that
public
officials
overlooked
because
entire
statutory
enforcement
schemes,
indeed
the
whole
reason
we
have
a
10b-5,
a
private
right
of
action
at
all,
is
a
recognition
that
no
matter
how
well
motivated
an
intention
and
whatever
skillful
a
job
they
are
doing,
regulators
simply
cannot
probe
and
uncover
all
instances
where
enforcement
is
appropriate.
that
is
why
we
have
private
enforcement,
not
only
in
10b-5,
in
the
anti-trust
statutes,
throughout
the
federal
regime.
it
is
why
we
have
informers'
rewards.
it
is
why
we
try
to
encourage
dissemination
and
uncover
of
fraud.
mr.
david
bonderman
well,
let
me
answer
that
this
way,
if
i
might,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
i
think
commissioner
smith
in
investors
management
gave
the
right
response
to
the
notion
of
selective
dissemination.
that
is
a
spit
word
the
sec
has
invented,
and
it
means
nothing.
because,
what
the
selective
dissemination
means,
if
it
means
you
did
not
make
it
public
because
you
did
not
put
it
on
the
wire,
of
course,
they
are
right.
no
one
would
put
this
on
the
wire.
the
wall
street
journal
would
not
publish
it.
if
it
means
that
you
chose
a
few
people
to
select
for
profit
and
did
not
try
to
get
it
out
as
broadly
as
possible,
that
is
not
what
was
done
here.
the
court
below
found--
mr.
david
bonderman
--if,
in
fact,
someone
uses
it
to
line
their
pocket
in
a
direct
sense,
i
think
we
have
a
different
case,
and,
indeed,
maybe
can
have
a
different
rule.
but,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
entire
theoretical
underpinnings
as...
i
am
referring
the
court,
for
example,
to
professor
easterbrook's
seminal
article
and
this
suggests
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
notion,
if
what
you
are
talking
about
is
encouraging
people
to
investigate
fraud
and
the
choice
is
to
have
them
not
investigate
fraud,
what
are
the
costs
you
are
willing
to
pay
to
encourage
someone.
if,
in
fact,
dirks
because
of
his
own
personality
did
this
essentially
for
free...
he
did,
in
fact,
do
it
essentially
for
free...
his
company
received
one
indirect
commission.
but,
you
cannot
expect
people
to
spend
their
own
time
and
incur
costs
to
investigate
fraud
doing
that.
in
fact,
it
has
never
been
the
case
in
this
society,
that
i
am
aware,
that
people...
altruism
was
supposed
to
contribute
solely
and
100
percent
to
their
doing
of
acts
that
the
society
regards
as
good.
that
goes
for
all
of
us
in
this
courtroom.
mr.
david
bonderman
that
depends
if
you
believe
that
judge
wright's
single-judge
opinion
creating
a
broker/dealer
duty
to
the
whole
world
which
he
announced
was
breached.
if
that
were
the
rationale,
i
suppose
it
would
apply
to
all
broker/dealer
employees--
mr.
david
bonderman
--it
would
apply
to
anybody
else
who
has
an
ethical
standard
of
special
care.
i
think--
mr.
david
bonderman
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
david
bonderman
well,
if
the
question
is
whether
they
would
now
have
a
privilege
against
the
libel
laws,
i
do
not
think
they
would.
mr.
david
bonderman
i
think
even
the
sec
would
admit
that
publishing
it
in
the
wall
street
journal
makes
it
public.
putting
it
out
over
the
wire
makes
it
public.
i
think
even
the
sec
would
admit
that.
beyond
that,
they
will
not
go.
mr.
david
bonderman
as
i
understand
the
sec--
mr.
david
bonderman
--no,
because
the
sec
takes
the
position
and
did
take
the
position
here,
in
fact,
the
administrative
law
judge
said
it
was
a
position
"of
great
merit".
that
the
only
way
you
can
protect
yourself
against
a
charge
of
fraud
is
to
make
it
public
in
the
sense
of
putting
it
on
a
tape--
mr.
david
bonderman
--they
did.
mr.
david
bonderman
they
did.
mr.
david
bonderman
yes,
because
the
theory...
the
sec
has
taken
a
walk
on--
mr.
david
bonderman
--if
the
newspaper
traded
or
someone
used
it
to
trade
and
it
was
not
making
it
public.
i
suppose
you
could
think
of
a
case
of
some
newspaper
with
very
small
circulation
in
some
little
town
in
south
carolina--
mr.
david
bonderman
--that
is
not
public
disclosure
because
the
persons
who
do
not
go
by
broad
and
wall,
for
example,
people
trading
in
seattle,
washington
never
find
out
about
it.
in
fact,
one
of
the
trading
defendants,
dreyfus,
did
disclose.
they
disclosed
substantially
everything
that
dirks
had
told
them
on
the
23rd
to
goldman
sachs
to
whom
they
sold
some
stock.
the
sec
argued,
and
the
administrative
law
judge
found...
these
folks
did
not
appeal...
that
even
had
they
done
so
he
said
there
was
great
merit
in
the
notion
that
that
is
not
enough.
you
cannot
simply
tell
who
you
are
dealing
with.
you
have
to
make
it
public.
that
is
the
whole
point
of
the
sec's
argument.
mr.
david
bonderman
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
not
the
sec's
position.
the
sec
has
taken
a
walk
on
judge
wright's
opinion.
they
say
to
this
court
in
footnote
27
that
we
do
not
deal
with
judge
wright's
opinion.
chenery
precludes
it.
it
was
not
advanced
below.
the
commission
did
not
rely
on
it.
this
court
should
not.
we
do
not
adopt
it.
mr.
david
bonderman
their
view
is
that
anybody
who
gets
any
information
from
inside
the
company
automatically...
that
is
the
other
half
of
judge
wright's
opinion--
mr.
david
bonderman
--well,
automatically
has
a
duty
to
disclose.
it
comes
from
out
of--
mr.
david
bonderman
--they
would
propose
to
sue
them
in
a
federal
court.
i
presume
they
have
done
so
in
other
cases.
perhaps
they
might,
as
the
did
with
mr.
chiarella
choose--
mr.
david
bonderman
--they
would
sue
for
aiding
and
abetting
violations
of
10b-5
by
someone
who
traded.
that
is
what
they
did
here.
they
sued
dirks--
mr.
david
bonderman
--there
is
a
tremendous
damage
liability.
dirks
here,
for
example,
was
sued
in
huge
class
actions.
no
one
recovered
from
them
because
he
refused
to
settle
and
ultimately
never
went
to
trial.
but,
also
thinking
back
to
chiarella,
let
us
not
forget
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
what
is
to
prevent
the
dirkses
of
the
future
from
being
indicted
for
this
if
this
court
says
that
dirks
did
wrong
here.
the
next
time
somebody
will
think
about
whether
the
sec
is
going
to
send
them
to
jail
for
doing
this.
it
is
hard
to
believe
of
anything
that
would
be
as
contraindicated
for
someone
who
is
attempting
to
disclose
a
fraud
even
if
he
did
not
do
it
perfectly.
mr.
david
bonderman
well,
i
think,
in
fairness
the
answer
is
not
quite
because
what
our
theory
has
been
is
that
under
chiarella
looking
at
the
majority
concurrence
and
dissents,
there
should
no
liability
for
information
where
there
is
no
breach
of
a
duty.
mr.
david
bonderman
well,
the
answer
to
that--
mr.
david
bonderman
--i
agree
with
that,
and
we
do
argue
that.
but,
we
can
go
a
step
further
here
because
of
what
dirks
did
in
a
way--
mr.
david
bonderman
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
bonderman
that
is
the
heart
of
our
argument.
we
also
recognize,
however,
the
misappropriation
arguments
that
the
chief
justice
made
in
his
dissent,
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is
at
least
possible
to
formulate
a
theory
of
misappropriation
which
would
not
apply
here,
which
might
apply
if
secrist
had
come
to
dirks
and
said,
look,
disseminate
this,
as,
in
fact,
dirks
did,
but
instead
dirks
went
home
and
traded
on
it
for
his
own
use
and
that
is
all
he
did.
it
seems
to
me
there
might
be
a
misappropriation
argument
along
the
lines
made
by
the
chief
justice
in
chiarella.
so,
we
recognize
that
such
an
argument
is
a
possibility.
mr.
david
bonderman
i
do
not
think
so
because
everybody
recognized
that,
and
at
least
secrist
planned,
if
that
is
what
it
could
be
called,
was
that
dirks
would
do
exactly
what
he
did
do,
which
was
tell
everybody
in
sight,
which
was
not
simply
clients.
he
told
competitors.
he
told
people
he
never
heard
of,
people
who
called
him
up
on
the
telephone.
he
told
the
ford
foundation.
mr.
david
bonderman
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
sec
knew...
reason
which
was
accurate.
he
was
told
by
secrist
on
the
19th
of
march
that
the
sec
knew.
he
was
told
by
secrist
on
the
7th
of
march
that
the
sec
had
been
told
about
it
repeatedly
over
a
period
of
years.
mr.
david
bonderman
that
argument
is
inconsistent,
as
i
understand
it,
both
with
the
sec's
position
and
with
the
entire
underlying
basis
for
the
development
of
the
law
being
that
it
is
nonpublic.
the
fact
that
i
tell
the
sec...
obviously
this
court
can
change
my
mind
as
to
what
the
law
has
been--
[laughter]
--but,
obviously
if
i
tell
the
sec,
it
does
not
make
it
public.
because
the
whole
notion
stems
from
a
parity
of
information
concept,
along
the
lines
rejected
by
this
court
in
chiarella,
the
truth
is
that
there
is
no
parity
of
information
or
anything
like
it
because
if
i
tell
the
sec
and
it
goes
in
their
investigatory
file
it
is
still
nonpublic
in
any
sense
that
that
has
ever--
mr.
david
bonderman
--that
is
exactly
where
it
is.
it
is
still
nonpublic,
and
i
believe
that
mr.
gonson
will
tell
you
that
and
will
tell
you
that
in
response
to
those
questions.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
bonderman
if
i
might
make
a
few
brief
points
in
my
remaining
time,
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
white's
questions.
the
sec's
position
is
not
that
everybody
should
go
down
together.
it
is
that
the
fraud
should
be
allowed
to
continue
because
all
incentive
for
anybody,
whether
it
is
secrist
or
dirks,
to
disseminate
any
such
information
if
they
do
not
have
access
to
a
wire,
should
be
withdrawn
from
them
because
they
should
risk
sec
proceedings,
$17,000,000
liabilities--
mr.
david
bonderman
--except
dirks
could
not
make
it
public.
he
tried
as
best
he
could.
he
did
not
have
a
wire
service.
no
one
would
print
these--
mr.
david
bonderman
--if
the
wall
street
journal
had,
in
fact,
published
it,
which
it
refused
to
do,
i
would
believe
that
the
sec
would
have
said,
okay,
thereafter
it
is
public.
but--
mr.
david
bonderman
--that
is
right,
but
the
truth
is
that
dirks,
remember,
did
not
trade.
he
told
everybody.
this
is
not
a
trading
without
disclosure.
dirks
told
everybody
he
could.
mr.
david
bonderman
i
think
so.
mr.
david
bonderman
because
i
believe
it
is
not
us,
but
the
sec
is
confused
as
to
whom
mr.
secrist
has
a
duty.
he
has
a
duty
first
to
the
shareholders
not
to
profit
himself.
i
believe
that.
secondly,
he
has
a
duty
to
the
public
to
disclose
fraud.
that
is
what
he
was
trying
to
do.
if
instead
what
he
had
done
is
simply
take
the
information,
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
lined
his
pocket,
we
would
not
have
the
implication
that
we
do
here
of
a
man
who
is
trying
to
disseminate
the
fraud--
mr.
david
bonderman
--i
think
that
is
a
tough
case.
i
think
he
probably
would
because
dirks
is
not
in
the
same
position
under
chiarella
and
under
the
common
law
fiduciary
cases
as
secrist
is.
dirks
had
no
contact
with
this
company.
he
is
not
a
fiduciary
of
the
company.
he
had
no
contact
with
the
stockholders.
he
was
not
in
a
position
of
faith
and
trust.
mr.
david
bonderman
but,
that
is
because
there
would
have
been
a
breach
of
duty
supposedly
in
making
that
information
available.
where,
i
ask
you,
is
there
any
breach
of
duty?
you
have
to
go
back.
what
is
wrong
with
the
sec's
position
here
and
why
their
arguments
make
no
sense
and
why
they
cannot
answer
your
questions--
mr.
david
bonderman
--the
problem
with
their
theory
is
that
it
is
obviously
wrong.
did
secrist
have
a
duty
not
to
disclose
information
relating
to
the
criminal
conduct?
let's
go
back
and
see
where
this
whole
tippee
theory
came
from.
the
notion
is
that
inside
information
is
in
a
sense
a
corporate
asset.
that
it
is
information
good
or
bad
to
be
controlled
by
the
corporation
for
its
private
purposes,
whether
it
is
texas
gulf's
strike,
good,
or
mcdonnell-douglass'
collapse
and
dividend
loss,
which
is
bad,
but
to
be
released
and
will
be
released
in
due
course
by
the
company
when
the
company
has
taken
such
legitimate
advantage
of
it
as
it
is
entitled
to.
that
is
where
the
whole
notion
came
from.
now,
how
can
you
possibly
apply
that
theory
to
information
with
respect
to
an
illegal
ongoing
fraud
which
the
management
has
been
concealing
for
11
years
and
will
conceal
for
the
rest
of
all
of
our
lives
if
it
can.
you
cannot,
i
submit.
that
is
why
there
is
no
breach
of
duty.
thank
you.
