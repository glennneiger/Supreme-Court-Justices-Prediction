white
is
this
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
sanction
put
on
dirks
apply
to
anybody
else
who
is
not
a
broker/dealer?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
non-broker/dealers?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
wall
street
journal
had
published
the
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
wall
street
journal
had
published
the
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
no.
what
about
the...
could
the
sec
get
after
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
that
is
using
inside
information.
that
is
publicizing--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
if
dirks
had
put
out
a
big
flyer
and
handed
it
out
in
a
supermarket,
would
he
had
been
any
better
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
sec
have
got
after
some
of
dirks'
tippees--
justice
byron
r.
white
--who
are
not
broker/dealers
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
anybody
who
was
a
tippee
using
inside
information
is
subject
to
sec
sanctions?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
a
newspaper,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
dirks,
i
said.
what
if
he
had
not
told
any
of
his
clients?
he
just
made
a
sign
that
said
so
and
so
is
a
fraudulent
outfit
and
stuck
it
up
at
the
corner
of
something
and
wall
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
applies
to
everybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
stuck
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
they
sue
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
they
ask
for?
well,
isn't
the
real
liability
to
the
purchaser
in
those
facts.
if
it
is
a
10b-5
violation
without
being
the
broker/dealer,
isn't
there
a
tremendous
damage
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
hearsay
file.
it
is
in
the
hearsay
file.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
position
is
it
would
not
have
made
any
difference
to
the
sec
if
he
had
gone
to
the
wall
street
journal
first
then
the
sec
and
then
to
his
clients.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
just
ask
you
again,
what
if...
just
leave
the
wall
street
journal
out...
suppose
he
had
just
gone
to
the
sec
and
then
went
ahead
and
did
what
he
did.
he
would
still
be
in
trouble
with
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
would
not
have
satisfied
his
obligation
under
the
law
to
go
to
the
sec
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
it
never
will
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
dirks
make
anything
public?
how
would
he
admit
it
publicly?
you
say
his
obligation
is
don't
trade
on
it,
information
that
is
not
public.
could
he
possibly
satisfy
his
obligation
to
make
it
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
he
have
done
at
the
new
york
stock
exchange?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
may
not
have
either.
they
may
not
have
taken
any
more
action
than
the
sec
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
could
he
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
way
he
could
do
it
if
he
traded
himself,
he
should
tell
his
customers.
i
mean,
tell
his
purchasers.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
insisted
to
his
clients,
now,
look,
before
you
unload
this
bad
stock,
you
should
tell
the
person
that
you
are
unloading
it
on
that
it
is
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
your
position.
whether
he
told
the
wall
street
journal,
the
sec
or
anybody
else,
as
long
as
it
was
not
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
this
non-broker/dealer?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
he
would
not
be
liable
if
he
put
it
in
the
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
an
obligation
that
dirks'
clients
owed
to
their
buyers
have
anything
to
do
with
inside
information?
it
would
not,
would
it?
it
is
just
that
they
have
information
they
should
have
disclosed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
may
have
a
duty,
an
independent
duty
under
10b--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
why
is
that?
it
is
just
that
they
had
information
they
should
have
disclosed
to
their
buyers.
it
would
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
inside
information
or
not,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
could...
suppose
a
holder
of
equity
stock
who
gets
ahold
of
some
inside
information
and
decides
to
sell
his
stock
because
he
does
not
think
it
is
worth
what
it
should
be
and
he
sells
it.
now,
what
can
the
company
do
to
him?
what
is
there
to
disgorge?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
there
was
a
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
there
was
a
duty?
suppose
there
is
a
duty.
what
can
the
company--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
what.
what
could
he
make
him
disgorge?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
did
not
make
the
profit?
he
avoided
a
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
everyone
should
go
down
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
again,
i
will
ask
what
i
asked
a
moment
ago.
if
dirks
and/or
his
tippees
had
disclosed
everything
they
knew
to
their
buyer,
would
that
have
discharged
their
duty
to
the
stockholders
of
equity?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
discharges
the
duty
not
only
to
the
buyer
but
to
the
stockholders?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
the
insider
owes
a
duty
to
the
stockholders--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
is
not
deceiving
them.
he
just
goes
and
sells
his
stock
and
he
tells
the
buyer
exactly
what
the
facts
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
satisfy
the
duty
to
the
stockholders?
justice
byron
r.
white
dirks
could
get
off
the
hook
by
making
the
whole
thing
public,
in
which
event,
everybody
would
go
down
together.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
was
printed.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
everybody
could
take
his
chances?
