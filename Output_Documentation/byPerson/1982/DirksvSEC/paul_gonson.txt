mr.
paul
gonson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
raymond
dirks
was
censured
by
the
commission
for
passing
material,
nonpublic
information
he
had
received
from
equity
funding
to
five
institutions.
on
the
basis
of
that
information,
they
sold
more
than
$17,000,000
worth
of
equity
funding
securities
to
investors
who
did
not
know
that
those
securities
were
virtually
worthless.
in
imposing
only
a
censure,
the
commission
took
into
account
mr.
dirks'
role
in
bringing
to
light
the
massive
fraud
at
equity
funding
as
a
result
of
his
investigation.
but
while
his
role
mitigated
any
sanction
to
be
imposed
upon
him
as
a
result
of
his
unlawful
tipping
activities,
it
did
not
excuse
them.
mr.
paul
gonson
was
anybody
at
the
commission
censured?
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
no,
your
honor.
let
me
address
the
question
of
the
information
to
the
sec,
which
is
set
forth
in
both
of
our
briefs.
the
events
that
are
involved
in
this
case
took
place
in
1973.
in
1971
a
former
attorney
who
worked
on
the
staff
of
the
sec
called
to
say
that
two
employees
of
the
sec,
one
mercado
and
one
templeton,
had
information
about
irregularities
at
equity
funding.
we
asked
that
they
be
sent
in.
they
were
sent
in,
but
they
were
very
circumspect.
they
did
not
tell
the
kind
of
story
that
the
lawyer
promised
that
they
would.
we
followed
up
on
it,
and
we
were
unable
to
get
that
information.
at
a
later
time,
the
attorney
for
mercado
who
became
concerned
that
his
client
had
gone
to
the
sec
unaccompanied
by
counsel
then
came...
and
then
there
is
an
issue
which
counsel
raises
as
to
whether
an
offer
of
immunity
was
made
whereby
mercado
allegedly
would
discuss
that.
from
the
sec's
staff's
memorandum
it
was
never
perceived
that
such
an
offer
was
made
and
so
that
matter
was
not
pursued.
on
the
9th
of
march,
which
was
two
days
after
secrist
told
dirks
the
story
he
had
told
him,
the
california
insurance
commission
representative
contacted
a
staff
member
of
the
los
angeles
office
of
the
sec
to
reveal
in
a
very
vague
way
that
some
allegations
were
being
made.
and,
the
response
was
made
that
the
california
authority
should
look
into
them
and
if
they
promise
if
they
bring
proof
to
contact
us
again.
this
has
to
be
understood,
i
think,
in
the
context
that
at
that
time
approximately
10,000
complaints
were
received...
this
is
back
in
1973...
by
the
sec.
today
it
is
closer
to
20,000
a
year.
so,
the
very
detailed
hard
story
that
dirks
knew
and
received
from
secrist,
and
which,
by
the
way,
he
corroborated
in
great
detail
by
talking
at
length
with
six
former
and
present
employees
of
equity
funding,
was
not
brought
to
the
sec,
rather
a
much
vaguer,
softer
information.
now,
it
may
assist
analysis
of
this
case
to
view
dirks
as
did
the
administrative
law
judge
in
this
case
as
proceeding
on
two
tracks.
on
the
first
track,
which
is
what
has
been
described
to
you,
dirks
was
seeking
to
confirm
and
expose
what
he
believed
was
a
fraud.
and,
as
the
administrative
law
judge
found
had
dirks
confined
his
disclosure
to
the
wall
street
journal
reporters,
or
had
he
gone
to
the
authorities,
"he
might
indeed
have
been
perceived
as
the
public
spirited
hero
he
portrays
himself.
"
but,
there
is
a
second
track.
dirks
informed
his
clients
about
this
fraud.
secrist
testified
that
he
wanted
dirks
to
disseminate
information
to
his
clients
so
that
they
would
sell
equity
funding
securities--
mr.
paul
gonson
--well,
the
point
of
the
case--
mr.
paul
gonson
--the
question
is
whether
the
information
should
become
public.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
an
information
issue.
it
is
not
whether
the
information
did
get
out
or
did
not
get
out--
mr.
paul
gonson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
this
case
is
governed
by
a
series
of
cases
since
1961.
those
that
the
sec
and
the--
mr.
paul
gonson
--that
is
correct.
that
an
insider
has
to
observe
what
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
abstain
or
disclose
rule.
either
the
information
has
to
be
disclosed
to
the
market
if
it
is
inside
information,
which
i
will
get
to,
or
the
insider
must
abstain
from
trading.
if
the
agency
knows
about
it
but
the
information
has
not
yet
become
publicly
available--
mr.
paul
gonson
--well,
it
may
very
well
be.
the
fact
that
the...
the
question,
your
honor,
boils
down
to
whether
if
someone
has
inside
information
that
person
is
free
to
trade
on
it
if
that
information
is
not
available
to
the
market.
mr.
paul
gonson
the
commission
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
that
it
views
the
role
of
analyst
as
very
important
and
said
that
they
perform
valuable
functions
in
putting
forth
their
analytical
skills
in
evaluating
data
and
then
putting
them
together
in
what
has
sometimes
been
referred
to
as
a
mosaic.
they
take
perhaps
what
might
be
inconsequential
bits
of
information
to
others
and
because
of
other
information
they
know
and
their
analytical
skills
they
can
make
predictions
and
they
can
make
suggestions
as
to
the
company
will
do
or
will
not
do.
that
is
different,
said
the
commission,
from
the
kind
of
devastatingly
important
information
that
would
become
obvious
to
anyone,
that
there
was
a
massive
fraud
at
equity
funding.
the
commission
said
a
line
has
to
be
drawn
between
the
usual
functions
of
analysts
and
their
trading
on
inside
information
that
would
not
be
available
to
anyone.
the
line
is
between
what
might
be
called
fairness,
as
far
as
is
possible
to
do
so,
on
the
one
hand,
as
against
the
role
that
analysts
play
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
paul
gonson
he
could
have
gone
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
which
he
did
not
do.
he
could
have
tried--
mr.
paul
gonson
--pardon
me?
the
new
york
stock
exchange
may
have
then
taken
action
as
it
ultimately
did--
mr.
paul
gonson
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
gonson
it
may
be
that
he
could
not
do
it,
your
honor,
but
that
if
he
could
not
do
it,
then
he
could
not
trade
on
it.
the
point
is
the
question
of
whether--
mr.
paul
gonson
--if
there
is
a
way
for
him
to
do
that.
it
is
very
difficult--
mr.
paul
gonson
--that
is
the
principle,
your
honor,
yes,
exactly
right.
it
is
difficult,
of
course,
to
do
that--
[laughter]
--when
trading
stock
at
an
impersonal
stock
market.
thus,
the
information
has
to
generally
become
public
in
some
other
way.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
your
honor.
dirks
could
have
attempted
to
make
it
public
by
doing
partly
what
he
did,
and
that
was
pressing
the
wall
street
journal
reporter
to
publish
his
story.
eventually,
the
wall
street
journal
did--
mr.
paul
gonson
--if
it
were
not
published
and
it
otherwise
did
not
become
publicly
available,
then
he
could
not
have
traded
on
it.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
to
take
the
first
part
of
your
question,
your
honor,
the
sec
could
have,
i
do
not
know
whether
it
would
have,
could
have
instituted
an
injunctive
action--
mr.
paul
gonson
--against
the
non-broker/dealer.
indeed,
it
has
instituted
a
great
many
injunction
actions
against
non-broker/dealers
or
what
we
refer
to
as
insider
trading
violations.
it
seeks
in
those
cases,
where
appropriate,
to
obtain
disgorgement
of
forgotten
gains.
mr.
paul
gonson
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
did
not
quite
catch
your
question.
mr.
paul
gonson
your
honor,
that
would...
your
honor
is
constructing
a
chain
of
what
we
refer
to
as
tippees--
mr.
paul
gonson
--dirks
would
be
liable
if,
as
we
have
in
the
facts
in
this
case,
he
received
information
from
a
person
he
knew
as
an
insider
and
the
insider
wanted
him
to
transmit
that
information
to
others
so
others
could
sell.
the
answer
is
yes.
dirks
would
be
liable.
mr.
paul
gonson
if
lawson
traded
on
the
basis
of
that
information.
mr.
paul
gonson
the
chain
goes
as
far,
your
honor,
as
persons
who
know
that
they
receive
information
from
an
inside
source
and
intend
or
reasonably
expect
either
that
they
or
the
person
they
told
it
to
will
trade
on
it.
that
is
how
far
it
goes.
it
may
reach
a
point
where
persons
may
not
know
the
source.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
if
they
knew.
mr.
paul
gonson
otherwise,
all
kinds
of
devious
arrangements
could
be
made
to
bypass
the
effect
of
these
laws.
now,
if
i
may
get
back
to
the
second
track
i
spoke
of.
secrist
wanted
dirks
to
disseminate
information
to
his
clients
so
that
dirks
would
sell
these
securities
in
large
quantities.
that
would
depress
the
price,
according
to
secrist,
and
that
would
cause
the
regulators
to
take
notice.
mr.
paul
gonson
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
secrist
was
just
interested
in
exposing.
he
testified,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
dirks,
and
dirks
testified
as
well,
that
dirks
asked
secrist,
did
you
sell
this
stock
short.
in
other
words,
are
you
trying
to
induce
me
to
do
something
to
depress
the
price.
secrist
said,
no.
secrist
said
that
a
friend
of
his
had
approached
him
and
said,
i
will
put
up
the
money.
we
will
sell
the
stock
short,
and
then
we
will
divide
the
profits.
but,
secrist
had
rejected
that
out
of
hand.
mr.
paul
gonson
your
honor,
the
sec
did
not
take
that
position
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
the
broker/dealer
has
an
independent
obligation
to
report
crime
to
the
sec?
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
i
am
not
aware
that
it
has
taken
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
so
far
as
i
am
aware.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
other
than
the
fact
that
since
he
was
a
registrar
it
was
appropriate
to
proceed
against
him
administratively.
the
theory
of
the
case
does
not
depend--
mr.
paul
gonson
--in
a
private
action?
mr.
paul
gonson
assuming
the
requisites
for
liability--
mr.
paul
gonson
--for
a
private
action
were
met.
it
could
conceivably
have
that...
well,
although
there
is
case
law
which
as
developed
in
an
area
not
germane
to
this
case
delimiting,
restricting
the
amount
of
recovery
in
terms
of
damage
liability,
but
that
is
a
separate
issue,
of
course--
mr.
paul
gonson
--if
blundell
knew
everything
that
dirks
knew
and
himself
traded,
the
answer
is
yes,
blundell
would
be
liable.
a
question
quite
separate
from
the
question
as
to
whether
he
should
publish
something--
mr.
paul
gonson
--he
would
not
be
liable
if
he
put
it
in
the
paper.
but,
this
is
not
a
disclosure
case,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
people
who
are
trading
in
securities
on
the
basis
of
undisclosed
information.
mr.
paul
gonson
it
may...
yes,
your
honor,
it
may
be
adequate
disclosure
if,
in
fact...
it
probably
would
be.
other
wire
services
would
probably
pick
up
that
story,
and
it
would
soon
become
available
to--
mr.
paul
gonson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
you
are
raising
a
question
that
has
been
asked
before
and
that
is
assuming
somebody
is
not
in
a
position
to
compel
public
disclosure
of
an
inside
fact
that
person
knows,
and
very
well
established
case
law,
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
discussed
in
this
court's
chiarella
decision
establishes
that
person
may
not
trade.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
raises
the
question,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
that
information
was
material.
that,
of
course,
is
a
closer
question
then
much
later
when
he
had
confirmed
that
with
six
former
equity
funding
insiders.
the
commission
found
that
it
was
material,
that
it
was
very
specific.
it
came
from
a
source
which
secrist...
excuse
me...
which
dirks
himself
said
was
a
credible
source.
it
was
a
three-and-one-half-hour,
very
detailed
conversation.
the
commission
found
that
yes,
it
was.
but,
i
am
not
sure
that
this
court
need
reach
that
because
trades,
of
course,
were
made
throughout
that
period
and
most
of
them
at
the
very
end
of
the
period
when,
by
that
time,
the
information
had
been
confirmed
in
great
detail
by
others
who
had
seen
or
witnessed
others
participate
in
the
fraud--
mr.
paul
gonson
--well,
the
question
of
materiality
is
a
question,
i
suppose
that
you
should
probably
assess
at
the
time--
mr.
paul
gonson
--that
is
correct,
the
materiality
of
the
information.
mr.
paul
gonson
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
no
argument
made
by...
no
duties
to
share-holders,
not
to
the
corporate--
mr.
paul
gonson
--by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
knew
the
information
for
a
long
time?
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
that
raises
a
number
of
questions,
your
honor.
was
the
information
material?
was
it
then
public?
i
think
the
fact
that
he
knew
about
it
a
long
time
is
not
as
relevant
as
the
fact
that
the
person
who
is
receiving
it
learned
it
only
then.
the
question
then
would
be
was
it
material.
of
course,
we
would
have
to
look
for
a
duty,
which
i
would
like
to
get
to,
and
if
it
was
received
in
a
breach
of
duty
and
the
person
knew
that
it
was
coming
from
an
insider,
then
he
would
be
disabled
from
trading
on
it.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
their
duty,
your
honor,
is
derivative
of
secrist's
duty
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
gonson
your
honor,
this
case
is
about
secrist's
duty
as
an
insider--
mr.
paul
gonson
--and
persons
who
stand
in
his
shoes.
mr.
paul
gonson
are
you
speaking
of
whether
the
company
has
a
right
of
action,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
gonson
but,
this
is
far
fueled
from
the
case
that
we
have
before
us.
mr.
paul
gonson
a
duty
owed
to
the
company?
mr.
paul
gonson
then
the
company
might
take
some
action
for
breach
of
that
duty.
mr.
paul
gonson
if
he
had
received
a
profit
in
breach
of
the
duty--
mr.
paul
gonson
--that
would
raise
a
question,
your
honor,
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
answer.
i
do
not
know
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
corporation
would
be
able
to
recover.
but,
if
i
may
return
to
the
principle
issue
in
this
case,
the
issue
is
one,
of
whether
secrist's
duty
either
to
abstain
from
trading
or
to
disclose
the
information
devolved
upon
dirks.
the
commission
held
that
dirks
stood
in
the
shoes
of
secrist
and
like
secrist
had
a
duty
to
disclose
the
equity
funding
fraud
to
those
he
traded
with
or
caused
others
to
trade.
mr.
paul
gonson
the
facts
support
the
answer
as
yes,
your
honor.
secrist
testified
that
he
told
dirks
this
information
hoping
that
dirks
would
give
that
information
in
turn
to
his
clients,
that
the
clients
would
trade
and
that
the
impact
of
the
trading
would
lower
the
stock
price
dramatically
and
that
would
cause
the
regulators
to
notice.
mr.
paul
gonson
so
far
as
i
am
aware
of,
the
commission
did
not.
secrist,
of
course,
would
not
be
amenable
not
being
a
registrar
with
the
agency.
mr.
paul
gonson
it
does
not,
your
honor,
but
in
this
proceeding,
which
was
an
administrative
proceeding,
then,
of
course,
persons
would
be
amenable
to
that
proceeding
only
if
there
was--
mr.
paul
gonson
--i
suppose,
perhaps,
you
are
drawing
an
implicit
assumption
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
commission
chose
to
proceed
against
dirks
and
not
against
secrist.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
exactly
correct.
and,
of
course,
while
we
are
here
in
this
court
only
with
regard
to
dirks,
the
commission's
administrative
proceeding
was
against
the
five
institutions
who
had
received
the
information
from
dirks
as
well.
mr.
paul
gonson
oh,
certainly,
your
honor.
we
have
all
kinds
of
elaborate
rules
that
prevent
staff
members
from
trading
on
securities.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
if
the
staff
members
had
been
derelict
in
their
duty
in
not
following
through.
yes,
there
are
administrative
procedures--
mr.
paul
gonson
--yes.
in
retrospect
i
suppose
there
are
other
kinds
of
information
that
may
come
to
the
sec,
and
as
i
explained,
some
20,000
complaints
a
year
that
may
later
turn
out
to
be
something
that
the
staff
persons
at
that
time
felt
were
not
as
important
as
other
complaints.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
was
so
in
1973.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
sometimes,
your
honor,
it
is
a
question,
i
think,
of
case
load
and
volume
where--
mr.
paul
gonson
--no,
of
course,
it
certainly
does
not,
and
it
investigates
a
great
many
of
them.
mr.
paul
gonson
it
generally
does,
your
honor,
if
you
are
talking
about
a
large
number
of
complaints
that
are
made
or
complaints
over
a
period
of
time,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
a
complaint,
if
you
will
call
it
that,
in
1971
then
another
one
in
1973,
neither
one
conveying
very
much
in
the
way
of
detailed
information.
if
i
may
return
to
the
question
of
duty...
the
commission
in
this
case
dealt
with
secrist
and
dirks.
secrist
was
an
insider
and
as
an
insider
owed
a
duty
to
shareholders
of
equity
funding
and
to
those
who
were
to
become
shareholders
by
the
very
act
of
buying
the
stock.
and,
that
duty
was
a
duty
of
disclosure
to
them,
a
duty
not
to
defraud
them.
and,
that
duty
rests
upon
the
fiduciary
relationship
recognized
in
the
common
law
between
the
corporate
insider
and
the
shareholder
and
not
on
the
separate
and
distinct
duty
of
the
insider
to
the
corporation
to
preserve
the
confidentiality
of
the
corporation's
secrets.
dirks
and
the
solicitor
general
who
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
confused
these
two
duties.
they
disregard
the
duty
to
the
shareholders.
they
argue
instead
that
because
secrist
had
no
duty
to
keep
confidential
the
information
about
the
fraud
he
breached
no
duty
to
equity
funding.
now,
this
court
recognized
in
the
chiarella
case
in
discussing
the
traditional
prohibitions
against
insider
trading
by
insiders
and
their
tippees
that
the
duty
to
disclose
inside
information
arises
not
from
any
obligation
to
the
corporate
source
of
the
information,
but
from
the
"relationship
between
the
corporate
insider
and
the
stockholders
of
the
corporation.
"
the
court
there
referred
among
other
sources
to
the
commission's
katie
roberts
decision
in
which
the
commission
had
recognized
that
a
relationship
of
trust
and
confidence
exists
between
the
shareholders
of
a
corporation
and
its
insiders
giving
rise
to
a
duty
of
disclosure
in
order
to
prevent
a
corporate
insider
from
taking
advantage
of
the
uninformed
shareholders.
the
court
also
refers
to
this
court's
1909
decision
in
strong
v.
repide
essentially
for
a
similar
proposition.
now,
the
duty
to
shareholders
is
separate
from
the
duty
of
confidentiality
that
the
insider
also
owes
to
the
corporation.
this
case,
as
i
mentioned
before,
is
not
about
confidentiality.
it
is
not
about
the
corporation's
interest
in
keeping
the
fraud
quiet.
it
is
about
the
shareholder's
interest
in
knowing
about
the
fraud
and
the
insider's
duty
to
tell
them
about
it
before--
mr.
paul
gonson
--of
course,
at
any
time
when
the
fraud
would
become
known,
the
stock
would
become
worthless
or
virtually
worthless
and
whoever
would
be
holding
it
at
that
time
would
have
worthless
stock.
but,
i
believe,
and
i
think
that
this
is
probably
an
accurate
statement,
that
people
who
buy
stock
assume
the
risk
that
some
companies
are
not
going
to
do
well.
i
do
not
think
that
people
assume
the
risk,
however,
that
infavored
insiders
are
going
to
be
able
to
bail
out
and
dump
their
stock
on
them
before
that
time
comes.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
chiarella
case
this
court
quoted
judge
learned
hand's
reasoning
in
gratz
v.
claughton,
a
second
circuit
case,
that
"the
director
or
officer
assumed
a
fiduciary
relation
to
the
buyer
by
the
very
sale;
for
it
would
be
a
sorry
distinction
to
allow
him
to
use
the
advantage
of
his
position
to
induce
the
buyer
into
the
position
of
a
beneficiary
although
he
was
forbidden
to
do
so
once
the
buyer
had
become
one.
"
and,
our
position
and
the
commission
said,
your
honor,
that
just
as
secrist
could
not
trade
his
tippees,
dirks
could
not
trade
and
dirks'
tippees,
the
institutions,
could
not
trade.
mr.
paul
gonson
so
long,
your
honor,
as
they
know
the
information
comes
from
an
insider,
was
communicated
with
the
intention
that
purchasers
be
defrauded.
that
intention
was
carried
out.
everybody
who
is
in
that
chain
ought
to
be
disabled
from
trading
on
that
information.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
if
there
were
a
way,
yes,
certainly.
that
is
the
principle
of
the
case.
if
the
buyer
of
the
stock
is
given
full
disclosure,
all
the
facts,
the
material
facts
known
by
the
seller--
mr.
paul
gonson
--it
discharges
the
duty
to
those
who
are
purchasers
in
response
to
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
gonson
owes
a
duty
to
the
stockholders
not
to
deceive
them--
mr.
paul
gonson
--as
i
mentioned
by
quoting--
mr.
paul
gonson
--yes,
your
honor.
when
i
speak
to
duty
of
the
stockholders,
i
am
referring
it
to
the
possible
other
side
of
the
case
where
the
insider,
as
was
the
case
in
strong
v.
repide
in
this
court,
buys
the
stock,
then,
of
course,
he
would
breach
the
duty
to
that
stockholder
in
purchasing
without
disclosure
of
material
information
because
of
the
fiduciary
relationship
that
he
bears.
when
he
sells
stock
then
he
breaches
the
duty
to
the
purchaser
who
by
that
very
act
of
fraud,
if
you
will,
then
becomes
the
shareholder.
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
i
think
it
is
immaterial
to
our
legal
position,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
it
is
immaterial,
yes,
to
the
basic
theory,
although
it
provides,
of
course,
some
reason
for
him--
mr.
paul
gonson
--yes,
your
honor.
this
was
the
second
track
i
referred
to.
i
never
was
able
to
develop
that
he
was
pursuing
with
equal
vigor--
mr.
paul
gonson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
because
potentially
under
the
theory
of
this
case,
dirks
was
free
to
have
enjoyed
that
$17,000,000
profit--
mr.
paul
gonson
--is
that
an
irrelevant
fact?
mr.
paul
gonson
i
have
been
told
it
is
a
fact,
but
then
their
two
activities
were
very
much
different,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
your
honor,
it
does
not
strike
me
as
curious,
if
i
may
answer
the
question.
if
one
discovers
a
crime
and
is
on
his
way
to
the
police
station
to
tell
them
about
it
and
decides
on
the
way
to
take
a
little
piece
of
it
himself,
then,
i
think,
that
tarnishes
his
image
as
a
hero.
if
another
person
publishes
an
article
and
does
not
profit
himself,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction.
that
does
not
strike
me
as
curious.
thank
you.
