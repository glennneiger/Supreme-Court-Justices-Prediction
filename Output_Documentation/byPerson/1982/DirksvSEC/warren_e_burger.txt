we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
afternoon
in
dirks
against
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
bonderman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
on
with
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--when
a
citizen,
a
private
citizen,
goes
to
the
sec
as
they
sometimes
go
to
the
fbi,
department
of
justice
or
a
newspaper,
are
there
any
regulations
first
that
could
guarantee
them
anonymity?
second,
beyond
that,
are
there
any
protections
from
liability
for
slander
or
libel,
if
they
do
it
in
writing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
go
at
their
own
risk,
then,
don't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.

now,
on
the
other
side
of
this
equation,
if
it
is
an
equation,
i
am
not
sure,
if
a
person,
an
analyst,
a
securities
analyst
has
clients
who
depend
upon
him,
would
he
be
at
risk
for
a
malpractice
if
he
had
information
and
did
not
give
it
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
malpractice
suit
that
has
reached
that
area
yet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gonson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
anybody
at
sec
censured?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
a
staff
member
from
the
sec
ever
be
an
insider
in
terms
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
information
first
came
to
them
from
whatever
sources
about
this,
is
there
some
procedure
to
deal
with
failures
to
act
as
distinguished
from
acting
to
take
advantage
of
the
inside
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
disciplinary
procedures,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
get
from
that
that
you
suggest
that
the
sec
is
sometimes
skeptical
of
the
information
it
gets.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
not
assume
that
you,
that
the
sec
would
believe
and
accept
every
rumor
that
comes
to
their
attention.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
there
are
repeated
rumors
focusing
on
one
area,
that
certainly
should
trigger
sec
action,
should
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
bonderman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
