justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
here
about
your
theory.
i
understand
the
objections
to
your
opponent's
theories,
but
under
your
view
if
everything
hinges
on
the
character
of
the
information,
it
is
illegal
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
protection
to
it,
it
does
follow,
does
it
not,
that
you
would
say
that
he
would
not
be
liable
even
if
he
had
traded
directly
and
never
told?
i
mean,
he
just
kept
it
secret
and
decided
to
make
as
much
money
out
of
it
as
he
could.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
the
case
i
posit,
under
your
view,
there
is
no
breach
of
a
duty.
i
do
not
know
why
you
are
afraid
to
make
the
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
got
information.
it
came
into
his
possession
lawfully.
there
is
nothing
privileged
about
it
because
the
more
people
find
out
about
it
the
better,
and
his
market
activity
will
eventually
cause
the
information
to
be
known
more
generally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
if
the
heart
of
your
argument
is
no
duty--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
is
seems
to
me
it
applies
in
that
situation
as
well
as
this
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
is
the
test,
why
wasn't
it
a
misappropriation
to...
even
if
he
got
only
one
indirect
commission
out
of
it...
to
that
extent?
wasn't
there
still
a
violation
of
a
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
correctly
understand,
the
sec
does
not
place
any
reliance
on
his
status
as
a
broker/dealer
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
other
than
for
the
discipline
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
theory
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
it
were
a
non-broker/dealer,
and
is
it
not
correct
that
if
the
same
case
arose
in
the
future,
it
would
be,
in
your
view,
it
would
subject
the
person
who
passed
on
the
information
when
he
should
not
have
to
a
liability
of
around
$17,000,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
facts.
assuming
these
facts--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
please.
supposing
during
the
period
between,
i
think
it
was
march
7th
and
the
time
he
went
out
to
the
west
coast,
he
had
nothing
but
the
secrist
source
of
information,
which
were
the
bad
facts
but
no
verification,
was
he
then
under
a
duty
to
refrain
or
disclose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
duty
arises
when
the
information
becomes
material,
and,
of
course,
you
are
not
entirely
sure
when
it
is
material
until
you
get
the
additional
information,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what
triggers
the
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gonson,
may
i
interrupt
you?
if
we
just
concentrate
on
duty
to
shareholders,
how
would
the
financial
interests
of
the
shareholders
have
been
served
by
a
total
disclosure
of
the
fraud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
people
who
are
potentially
victims
in
this
situation
are
the
people
who
may
buy
into
the
company--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
those
who
are
already...
so,
you
really,
it
seems
to
me,
be
focusing
on
the
duty
to
potential
future
shareholders
because
existing
shareholders...
it
just
cuts
the
other
direction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
about
your
theory.
what
about...
assuming
that
secrist
had
traded,
would
there
be
liability
for
secrist?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
tried
to
tell
the
wall
street
journal
just
as
dirks
did,
and
the
wall
street
journal
would
not
publish
and
then
he
said,
well,
the
only
way
i
can
get
this
into
the
public
is
by
selling
and
causing
the
market
to
fall
and
cause
an
investigation,
would
he
still
be
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
he
had
traditional
inside
information,
he
would
be
in
the
same
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
their
argument
is
that
the
duty
to
refrain
or
disclose
was
something
that
imposed
on
secrist,
he
violated
that
and
the
person
to
whom
he
disclosed
had
the
same
duty.
that
is
their
theory.
