mr.
bonderman,
we
are
dealing
here,
i
guess,
only
with
the
activities
of
mr.
dirks
in
those
few
days
before
he
went
to
the
sec.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
shouldn't
he
have
gone
in
the
first
place
to
the
sec
and
then
gone
ahead
and
done
all
of
the
things
that
he
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
suppose
you
could
argue
to
us
that
it
should
be
a
defense
that
he
reported
it
to
the
sec.
that
is
another
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
isn't
it
his
obligation
to
go
as
a
broker/dealer
to
the
sec?
you
would
acknowledge
that
at
some
point
it
is
his
obligation?
would
you,
or
would
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
he
ever,
in
your
view,
have
an
obligation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
you
would
assume
for
purposes
of
answering
the
question
that
his
obligation
as
a
licensee
to
be
a
broker/dealer
does
obligate
him
to
go
to
the
sec
with
the
information,
then
could
you
agree
that
he
ought
to
go
there
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
i
suppose,
the
sec
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
though,
found
that
the
information
he
had
during
the
days
before
he
went
to
the
sec
was
material
specific
in
detail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
mr.
dirks
and
his
firm
have
traded
in
the
stock
on
their
own
during
that
interval
of
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
position?
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
your...
if
the
information
that
mr.
dirks
had
received
were
merely
adverse
but
not
indicating
criminal
conduct,
would
petitioner
have
been
liable
as
a
tippee
for
the
failure
to
disclose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
clearly
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
if
you
are
right,
and
if
there
is
no
accompanying
obligation
on
mr.
dirks
to
go
right
away
to
the
sec
and
disclose
the
information,
then
that
would
build
an
incentive
to
people
who
might
uncover
this
information
to
continually,
selectively
disseminate
it
and
to
extend
that
time
as
long
as
possible
to
maximize
their
profits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
if
you
are
right,
it
might
be
done
in
the
future
for
others.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
not
the
sec.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
i
still
do
not
understand
what
would
be
the
matter
with
a
rule
that
said,
the
broker/dealer
can
discharge
his
obligations,
if
there
are
any,
by
telling
the
sec
and
then
going
ahead
and
doing
whatever
he
wants
because
he
has
made
it
public.
now,
what
is
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
am
just
not
clear,
then,
what
your
response
is
to
justice
white
about
what
mr.
dirks
could
have
done
to
make
it
public.
would
you
explain
that
more
clearly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
if
it
were
not
published,
then
what
could
he
do?
nothing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
sec
take
the
position
that
a
broker/dealer
has
an
obligation
to
disclose
to
the
sec
evidence
of
criminal
conduct
that
the
broker/dealer
learns
of?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
it
take
that
position
generally?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
report
anything
uncovered
in
the
area
of
criminal
activity.
no,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
as
part
of
the
duties
of
the
licensee
or
professional
obligations
of
the
licensee?
