william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
sec's
basis
for
assertion
of
authority
is
the
broker/dealer
relationship,
what
action
could
they
take
to
enforce
this
same
sort
of
obligation
against
someone
who
is
not
a
broker/dealer
and
who,
therefore,
is
not
subject
to
disciplinary
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
this
question
should
be
better
put
to
you
opponent,
but
how
would
the
sec
propose
to
enforce
that
duty
against
someone
who
is
not
a
broker/dealer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
your
ordinary
analyst...
he
makes
his
living
by
analyzing
rumors
and
that
sort
of
thing,
doesn't
he?
what
did
dirks
do
that
was
so
different
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
secrist
want
to
make
a
private
profit
or
was
he
just
interested
in
exposing
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
does
it
follow
from
your
answer
that
if
blundell,
the
reporter,
had
done
everything
that
dirks
had
done,
that
he
might
be
liable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
is
a
reporter
for
the
albuquerque
journal
instead
of
the
wall
street
journal,
does
publishing
in
the
albuquerque
journal
about,
say
a
new
york
stock
exchange
traded
security
count
as
disclosure
in
your
book?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
most
individuals
do
not
have
access
to
a
wire
service
that
they
can
just
go
to
their
office
and
start
typing
out
a
message.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
secrist
in
the
view
of
the
commission
commit
the
same
offense,
whatever
that
may
be,
that
dirks
committed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
commission
ever
go
after
secrist?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
theory,
i
thought,
was
broad
enough
so
the
liability
did
not
depend
on
the
fact--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
the
commission's
view,
dirks'
conduct
was
bad
but
secrist's
was
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
leave
the
assumption
drawing
to
you.
it
is
just
that
there
is
a
particular
kind
of
remedy
available
against
dirks
that
is
not
available
against
secrist.
