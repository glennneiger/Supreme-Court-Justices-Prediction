justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gonson,
suppose
dirks
had
not
been
a
broker/dealer
and
still
the
information
had
come
to
him
and
he
passed
it
on.
i
take
it
the
sec
would
not
have
had
any
jurisdiction
over
him,
but
would
the
party
who
purchased
the
stock
have
a
case
against
him?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
mr.
dirks
had
told
only
mr.
lawson
of
the
wall
street
journal
and
mr.
lawson
had
kept
the
information,
would
dirks
be
liable?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
assume
that
dirks
was
not
a
broker/dealer.
the
information
came
to
him.
he
passed
it
on
to
lawson
of
the
wall
street
journal
and
mr.
lawson
told
a
friend
of
his
who
owned
securities,
did
not
publish
just
told
a
friend,
who
would
be
liable?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
dirks
be
liable?
he
told
lawson.
he
is
not
a
broker/dealer.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
though
lawson
himself
owned
no
stock--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--well,
he
told
his
friend.
how
far
does
the
chain
go?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
each
member
of
the
chain
would
be
liable?
if
they
knew.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gonson,
we
are
not
giving
you
much
of
a
chance
to
argue
you
case,
but
there
are
so
many
interesting
questions.
suppose...
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
how
long
would
secrist
be
the
possessor
of
inside
information?
suppose
he
had
withheld
it
for
four
or
five
years.
no
one
else
had
ever
discovered
it.
he
obviously
did
not
owe
any
duty
not
to
disclose
confidential
information
to
equity,
did
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
did
not.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
he
had
finally
concluded
five
years
later
that
he
had
a
guilty
conscience.
he
should
have
disclosed
it
sooner.
he
then
told
a
friend
and
the
friend
who
owned
equity
stock
sold...
i
suppose
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
that
runs
against
a
former
insider?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
i
think
one
might
assume
that
the
information
was
no
longer
accurate
or
dependable...
not
in
this
case
where
the
fraud
was
manifest.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gonson,
i
just
want
to
be
clear
about
this,
but
as
i
understand
your
position,
it
is
perfectly
immaterial
that
dirks'
firm
profited
by
the
information
he
had
disseminated?
that
is
immaterial
to
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
immaterial
to
your
basic
theory.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
provides
some
color,
but
that
is
really
all,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
liability
would
have
existed
even
if
there
had
been
no
profit
whatever?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and,
may
i
ask
an
irrelevant
question?
is
it
a
fact
that
the
wall
street
journal
was
nominated
for
the
pulitzer
prize
and
dirks
was
prosecuted?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
said,
is
it
a
fact.
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
a
fact
or
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
strike
you
as
curious
from
the
standpoint
of
society
in
general
if
that
were
true?
