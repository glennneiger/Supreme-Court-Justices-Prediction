mr.
peter
g.
nash
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
arises
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it
involves
two
arbitration
issues
in
the
tension
between
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
seniority
layoff
provisions
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
1973,
the
eeoc
investigated
the
company's
plant
in
mississippi
and
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
company
had
discriminated
in
its
hiring
practices
on
the
basis
of
sex.
in
1974,
the
company
and
the
union
which
whom
it
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
bargained
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement.
at
the
time,
both
the
union
and
the
company
knew
of
the
eeoc's
findings,
knew
that
the
eeoc
was
seeking
a
conciliation
agreement
which
might
disrupt
the
seniority
layoff
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
nonetheless
entered
into
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement,
retaining--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--not
necessarily
so,
your
honor,
but
that
becomes
relevant
later
on
when
we
get
to
the
argument
about
the
court
order
that
enjoined
the
company
and
the
union,
and
whether
or
not
that's
a
valid
defense
to
a
breach
of
contract
action.
on
december
11,
1974,
the
company
and
the
eeoc
entered
into
a
conciliation
agreement
which
changed
or
would
change
the
layoff
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
by
providing
that
if
there
is
a
layoff
in
the
plant,
females
must
be
retained
in
the
workforce
in
the
same
percentage
at
the
end
of
the
layoff
as
they
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
layoff.
the
reason
for
that
being
to
protect
those
recently
hired
female
employees
from
layoff.
on
december
19,
1974,
the
company
had
a
layoff
of
some
employees.
a
few
more
were
laid
off
in
the
early
part
of
1975.
the
union
filed
grievances
contending
that
those
layoffs
violated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
some
more
senior
men
were
laid
off
whereas
junior
seniority
women
were
retained.
the
company
amended
and
then
complained
in
the
then
present
law
suit
seeking
to
enjoin
the
union
from
processing
those
grievances
to
arbitration,
added
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
as
a
defendant
and
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
court
as
to
which
should
apply,
the
provisions
of
the
eeoc
conciliation
agreement
or
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
because--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--possibly,
sir,
but
there
was
a
tension,
and
i
think
an
admitted
tension
between
the
conciliation
agreement
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
we
have
different
facts
in
this
case,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
we
are
dealing
with
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
an
eeoc
conciliation
agreement,
neither
of
which
have
historically
by
this
court
been
treated
as
standard
commercial
contracts.
secondly,
we
have
in
this
case
an
eeoc
conciliation
agreement
which
was
sought
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
in
order
for
the
employer
to
come
into
compliance
with
the
law.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
if
the
union
had
notice,
as
it
did,
of
the
eeoc
conciliation
process,
and
if
the
union--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--if
the
union
had
notice
of
the
process,
of
the
eeoc
conciliation
process,
and
was
afforded
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
that
process,
then,
yes,
i
am
saying
that
the
conciliation
agreement
between
the
company
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
may
amend
or
change
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
i
am
not
saying
that
the
union
was
without
remedy
in
that
case.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
the
authority
for
that
position
is,
i
think,
multiple
but
primarily
pepsico,
inc.,
versus
ftc,
472
f2d--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--179.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
furthermore,
i
think
that
is
consistent
with
what
this
court
held
in
zipes
versus
twa.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
yes.
i
think
the
one
i
am
arguing
is
consistent
with
that.
there
is
additional
authority
and
that
is
the
overriding
premise
underlying
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act,
that
being
that
the
preferred
means
of
resolving
title
vii
liability
is
through
the
conciliation
process
with
eeoc.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
not
to
the
extent
that
it
forecloses
the
union
from
having
a
remedy,
your
honor.
indeed,
the
union
does
have
a
remedy
in
that
case.
the
remedy
either
is
to
participate
in
the
conciliation
process
and
agree
or,
failing
that,
to
bring
an
action
against
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
and
the
employer
seeking
to
stay
any
conciliation
agreement
it
believes
is
not
necessary
and
not
appropriate
to
remedy
title
vii
violations.
that
remedy,
i
think,
is
available
to
the
union
and
we
are
not
contending
that
in
such
a
law
suit
that
either
the
employer
or
the
eeoc
can
say,
no,
no,
our
agreement
covers
this
and
you,
union,
have
no
cause
of
action.
indeed,
they
would
have
that
cause
of
action.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
it
would
be
similar
to
a
proceeding
in
a
title
vii
now
where
there
is
a
consent
decree,
a
reasonableness
proceeding
or
a
fairness
proceeding
in
which
it
is
determined
whether
or
not
the
conciliation
agreement
entered
into
is
in
fact
reasonable
and
fair,
whether
it
meets
the
requirements
of
title
vii
without
unduly
impinging
upon
the
rights
of
the
majority
employees
presently
in
the
workforce.
as
i
say,
the
employer
and
the
eeoc
entered
into
this
conciliation
agreement.
the
union,
in
fact,
brought
grievances.
the
employer
went
into
court
and
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
court
as
to
which
should
apply,
the
conciliation
agreement
or
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
court,
in
november
1976...
1975,
came
down
with
a
decision
holding
that
the
conciliation
agreement
applies
and
ordering
both
the
company
and
the
union
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
conciliation
agreement
and
not
to
abide
by
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
subsequently,
in
1976--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--the
court,
i
believe,
interpreted
it
as
an
injunction,
your
honor.
the
same
judge
heard
this
case,
which
is
now
before
this
court,
and
stated
in
his
opinion
there
that
had
the
parties
not
complied
with
that
order,
he
would
have
found
them
in
contempt,
and
that
certainly
is
the
way
in
which
at
least
the
company
construed
that
order.
in
1976,
as
i
say,
there
was
a
layoff
and
there
were
more
grievances
filed.
in
january
1978,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
injunction
order
that
had
been
issued...
or
the
order
that
had
been
issued
by
the
district
court
back
in
1975.
the
fifth
circuit
did
on
the
grounds,
basically,
of
this
court's
teamster
decision
holding
that
you
can't
disrupt
otherwise
valid
seniority
provisions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
order
to
remedy
title
vii
violations.
immediately
after
the
fifth
circuit's
decision,
the
company
reinstated
all
of
the
senior
men
who
were
laid
off
to
junior
women,
and
the
cases
then
went
to
arbitration
pursuant
to
the
statement
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
ordering
the
parties
to
arbitrate
the
company's
breach
of
the
seniority
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
first
arbitration
involved
a
layoff
which
had
occurred
in
1976,
after
the
district
court's
order.
arbitrator
sabella
in
that
case
said
that
the
company
didn't
violate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
had
done
exactly
what
the
court
had
ordered
it
to
do,
and
as
a
consequence
the
company
should
not
be
liable
for
back-pay
for
the
employee
involved
in
that
case.
a
second
case
was
brought
before
abitrator
barrett
involving
three--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--no.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
don't
know
whether
he
is
or
not.
all
of
these
employees
were
returned
to
work
immediately
upon
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
reversing
the
district
court's
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
i
am
assuming
that
if
he
is
not
working
for
grace,
it
is
for
some
reason
other
than
this
case.
all
of
the
senior
males
were
immediately
returned
to
work,
and
there
is
no
contention
here
that
the
company
continued
to
"violate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement"
after
the
district
court's
order
was
reversed.
all
the
men
were
in
fact
brought
back.
but
there
has
been
no
award
of
back-pay
for
mr.
jowers.
the
second
arbitrator,
mr.
barrett,
was
confronted
by
the
union's
contention
in
that
arbitration
that
he
did
not
have
to
follow
the
sabella
award
because
the
sabella
award
was
considering
or
considered
different
factual
circumstances.
the
union
contended
in
that
arbitration
that
sabella
had
dealt
with
a
bumping.
indeed,
mr.
jowers,
rather
than
having
been
laid
out
of
the
workforce,
had
merely
been
bumped
from
his
job
down
to
a
lower
job,
and
then
ultimately
laid
off.
whereas
the
three
subsequent
cases
that
were
now
being
argued
before
mr.
barrett
involved
actual
layoffs
of
senior
males
from
the
workforce.
the
union
contended
that
these
involved
different
situations,
different
fact
situations,
and
therefore
arbitrator
barrett
was
not
bound
by
the
earlier
award
of
mr.
sabella.
the
arbitrator
in
that
case,
arbitrator
barrett,
found
that
in
fact
the
cases
involved
exactly
the
same
issues.
he
found,
however,
that
mr.
sabella
had
exceeded
his
jurisdiction
and
authority
by
not
referring
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
by
merely
finding
that
it
wasn't
fair
to
hold
the
company
liable
because
it
did
what
a
court
said
it
ought
to
do.
mr.
barrett
ordered
back-pay
for
all
of
the
employees
affected
by
that
layoff
during
the
pendency
of
the
court
order.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
at
this
point
that
the
case
was
tried
before
arbitrator
barrett
and
has
been
tried
all
the
way
through
the
courts
as
if
all
of
the
layoffs
here
were
involved
with
the
court
order...
followed
the
court
order
rather
than
before
the
court
order.
indeed,
the
company
raised
the
distinction
between
layoffs
under
the
conciliation
agreement
pre-court
order
and
layoffs
that
occurred
after
the
court
order
in
the
district
court
on
the
initial
motions
for
summary
judgment,
but
noted
at
that
time
that
the
parties
had
not
arbitrated
the
case
based
on
those
distinctions.
the
union
never
picked
up
on
the
distinction,
nor
did
the
district
court,
nor
did
the
fifth
circuit.
as
a
consequence,
the
case
we
submit
comes
before
you
as
if
all
of
these
layoffs
occurred
following
the
court
order.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
parties
have
conceded
throughout
this
litigation,
up
until
the
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court,
that
if
in
fact
the
sabella
award
is
"enforceable",
then
in
fact
the
barrett
award
must
fail.
that
is
the
agreement,
and
the
understanding
of
the
parties,
so
i
think
you
must
look
to
the
sabella
award.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
would
respectfully
disagree
to
a
certain
extent.
first
of
all,
i
do
believe
that
it
is
a
concession
of
fact.
secondly,
even
if
it
is
a
concession
of
law,
i
believe
that
it
is
too
late
to
change
your
legal
concession
after
you
have
already
tried
the
case
before
the
district
court,
the
fifth
circuit,
in
your
op.
cert
memorandum
to
this
court,
and
none
ultimately
say,
your
honors,
we
have
got
a
whole
different
ballgame,
we
have
got
a
whole
different
argument.
indeed,
what
we
have
here
is
the
union...
the
union
filed
the
first
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
this
case
in
the
district
court.
it
contended
in
there
that
the
barrett
award
cannot
stand
because
the
sabella
arbitration
award
has
to
fall.
it
has
to
fall,
number
one...
barrett
is
not
required
to
follow
sabella
for
two
reasons.
number
one,
sabella
decided
a
different
issue,
therefore,
barrett
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
issue.
secondly,
sabella
went
beyond
his
jurisdiction
and
authority,
therefore,
his
award
is
void.
the
union
asked
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not,
as
a
matter
of
law
under
legal
precedent,
that
award
would
have
been
"enforceable",
and
contended
that
it
was
not.
as
a
consequence,
the
barrett
award
did
not...
barrett
did
not
have
to
follow
that
award.
the
union
started
the
law
suit
not
in
any
way
by
saying
that
there
was
any
reference
due
to
mr.
barrett.
but
indeed
started
the
whole
argument
and
the
whole
law
suit
on
the
basis
that
if
the
sabella
award
stands,
barrett
must
fall.
if
the
sabella
award
does
not
stand,
then
barrett
must
be
approved
and
must
be
enforced.
that
is
the
way
in
which
the
litigation
has
gone,
all
the
way
up
until
the
filing
of
the
briefs
on
the
merits
in
this
court.
the
whole
issue
has
been
was
the
sabella
award
"enforceable".
in
no
instance--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--i
think
an
examination
of
that
language
will
not
indicate
that
the
union
at
any
time
argued
that
any
deference
was
due
to
mr.
barrett's
award.
indeed,
the
reason
for
that
language,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
same,
is
that
the
company
had
argued
in
the
district
court
and
again
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
even
barrett
couldn't
determine
as
a
procedural
matter
whether
or
not
the
sabella
award
was
valid
initially
because
the
union
had
never
brought
a
law
suit
to
set
aside
the
sabella
award
in
a
timely
manner.
accordingly,
everybody
was
foreclosed
from
contesting
whether
or
not
the
sabella
award
was
valid.
i
believe
the
language
you'll
find
in
the
union's
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit
says,
no,
that
is
not
true.
we
are
not
foreclosed
because
we
didn't
bring
a
law
suit
in
time.
indeed,
we
could
give
this
issue
to
barrett
to
make
a
determination,
but,
but
that
determination
is
not
binding
upon
the
court.
ultimately,
the
barrett
award
or
whatever
barrett
had
to
say
would
be
determined
in
the
courts
based
upon
whether
or
not
the
courts,
using
court
precedent,
would
have
enforced
the
sabella
award.
yes,
i
think
the
language
might
be
susceptible
to
the
question
you
pose,
except
for
the
fact
that
that
was
clearly
in
response
to
a
totally
different
argument
not
present
in
this
court.
at
no
time
did
the
union
ever
argue
that
barrett's
award
was
due
any
deference
by
the
court.
it
was
a
flat-out
argument
that
the
court
must
decide
whether
the
sabella
award
is
valid,
and
on
that
decision
rides
or
falls
the
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
enforce
the
barrett
award.
i
would
like
to,
if
the
court
please,
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
just
a
couple
of
things.
the
hypothetical
you
posed
at
the
end
is
basically
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
company
indeed
went
into
court
here,
but
the
union
and
the
eeoc
joined...
filed
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment,
and
it
is
they
that
litigated
whether
or
not
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
valid
under
title
vii.
the
court
determined
that,
no,
it
was
not
valid
under
title
vii,
and
an
order
issued
ordering
both
the
employer
and
the
union
to
comply
with
the
conciliation
agreement,
not
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
substance
of
this
thing
is
that
there
was
in
fact
a
court
order.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
misunderstood,
then,
too.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
guess
i
am
saying
that
it
is
analogous.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
correct.
the
only
difference
is
that
this
court
order
ultimately
was
reversed
on
appeal
by
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
then
is,
is
the
employer
or
the
union
in
this
case,
for
they
too
were
enjoined,
to
be
excused
from
breaching
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
complying
with
the
court
order
during
the
time
that
the
court
order
was
in
effect.
we
contend
that,
indeed,
they
were.
people
have
to
abide
by
court
orders
unless
and
until
they
are
set
aside.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
had
the
employer
gone
to
the
union
and
said,
"we
don't
want
to
comply
with
that
court
order.
"
"would
you
agree
with
us?
"
the
union
could
not
have
agreed
to
go
back
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
they
were
enjoined
by
the
order
as
much
as
was
the
employer.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
it
was
an
injunction
against
that,
but,
no,
it
went
further,
your
honor.
it
said--
mr.
peter
g.
nash
--it
said
that
the
parties
are
to
abide
by
the
conciliation
agreement,
not
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
that
is
my
understanding,
yes.
that
is
my
recollection.
furthermore,
i
believe
that
the
union
cannot
argue
that
it
was
the
"company's
fault"
that
this
order
issued.
they
state
two
bases
for
that.
number
one,
that
the
company
entered
into
the
conciliation
agreement,
but
there
is
no
indication
in
this
case
that
that
in
fact
was
what
resulted
in
the
court
order.
there
was
a
fully
litigated
case
between
the
eeoc
and
the
union
as
to
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
ultimately,
the
court
found,
yes,
the
district
court,
and
said
that
the
remedy
for
that
would
be
a
conciliation
agreement,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
in
fact
the
court
would
not
have
come
up
with
some
remedy
in
any
event
in
that
litigation.
it
merely
had
the
conciliation
agreement
to
turn
to,
a
conciliation
agreement
which,
by
the
way,
was
relatively
moderate
and,
indeed,
might
have
protected
more
senior
men
than
did
the
conciliation
agreement.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
don't
see
the
relationship.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
because
in
this
case
what
the
court
said
was,
"this
agreement
between
you,
mr.
union,
and
you,
mr.
employer
is
illegal.
"
mr.
peter
g.
nash
in
this,
the
court
said:
"that
is
illegal.
"
"i
am
telling
you,
don't
abide
by
it,
abide
by
this
instead.
"
it
told
both
parties
to
do
that.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
i
think
that
that
is
the
distinction
between
our
cases.
mr.
peter
g.
nash
let
me
go
one
step
further
on
the
fault
argument
and
that
is
that
in
this
case
the
union
further
argues
that
the
fault
is
that
the
employer
indeed
discriminated
against
the
females,
and
accordingly
the
employer
cannot
get
out
from
under
its
collective
bargaining
agreement.
yet,
the
union
argues
that
any
valid,
finely
enforceable
court
order
saying
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
title
vii
takes
precedence
over
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
there
is
no
valid,
finely
enforceable
title
vii
order
that
isn't
based
upon
the
company's
discrimination.
as
a
consequence,
the
union
argues
too
much
that,
indeed,
the
company's
prior
discrimination
cannot
be
a
basis
for
saying
that
the
employer
is
relieved
from
complying
with
the
court
order
which
changes
that
seniority
system.
thank
you.
