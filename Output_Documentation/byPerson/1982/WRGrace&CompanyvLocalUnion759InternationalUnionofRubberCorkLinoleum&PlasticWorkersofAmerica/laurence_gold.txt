mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
this
matter
at
this
juncture,
there
are
four
questions
before
the
court.
the
first
we
will
label
the
arbitration
clause
question.
the
second,
what
mr.
nash
has
stated
as
the
concession
question.
third
concerns
the
district
court
order,
and
the
last
the
eeoc
conciliation
agreement.
i
intend,
if
that
is
permissible,
to
address
those
question
in
that
order.
with
regard
to
the
substance
of
the
question
concerning
the
arbitration
award,
this
is
a
case
by
the
company
to
overturn
a
particular
arbitration
award,
the
award
rendered
by
arbitrator
barrett
and
called
the
barrett
award.
arbitrator
barrett
was
faced
with
a
threshold
issue
in
considering
the
grievances
filed
with
him,
which
is
quite
common,
namely,
what
deference
if
any
is
to
be
accorded
to
a
prior
arbitrator's
award
in
dealing
with
the
same
aspects
of
the
contract.
arbitrator
barrett
determined
not
to
follow
the
prior
award,
the
so-called
sabella
award,
which
had
never
been
taken
to
court
and
was
a
preexisting
determination
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
contract.
he
did
so
after
quite
a
painstaking
and
thorough
evaluation
of
the
prior
award.
he
did
so
by
erecting
that
is
a
far
higher
standard
than
arbitrators
normally
follow
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
follow
a
prior
award.
he
determined
not
to
follow
the
prior
award.
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
his
obligation
in
deciding
what
the
express
terms
of
the
agreement
meant
compelled
him
to
look
at
the
agreement
to
look
at
the
agreement
itself
and
not
to
handle
the
matter
as
arbitrator
sabella
had
done.
his
actions,
as
i
say,
were
in
accord
with
the
normal
way
arbitrators
handle
this
matter
and,
if
anything,
more
favorable,
far
more
favorable
to
the
company
than
is
the
norm.
in
addition,
the
lower
court
law
is
uniform
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
law,
no
section
301
requirement
of
arbitral
stare
decisis.
the
parties
can
bargain
about
that
as
they
bargain
about
other
matters.
after
arbitrator
barrett
issued
his
award,
the
company
was
dissatisfied
with
it,
and
as
is
its
right,
went
to
court
to
overturn
that
award.
we
believe
that
the
proper
question
here,
the
analytic
question
that
ought
to
be
faced
is
what
standard
is
the
barrett
award
insofar
as
barrett
refused
to
follow
the
earlier
sabella
award
to
be
judged
by.
it
is
our
submission
that
the
standard
is
the
one
stated
in
this
court's
enterprise
case.
did
arbitrator
barrett,
in
fulfilling
his
obligation,
issue
an
award
that
draws
its
essence
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
did
he
decide...
did
he
interpret
the
contract
since
the
arbitrator
is
charged
with--
mr.
laurence
gold
what
arbitrator
barrett
did
here,
and
what
most
arbitrators
do,
is
to
say
that
presumptively
the
prior
arbitration
award
is
to
be
followed,
but
there
is
a
certain
threshold
past
which
an
arbitrator
is
not
required
to
go.
different
arbitrators
state
that
different
ways.
it
may
turn
on
the
particular
language
of
the
agreement.
arbitrators
are
uniform
in
believing
that
at
least,
absent
extraordinary
contract
language,
there
is
no
rigid
rule
of
stare
decisis.
indeed,
i
need
not
cite
the
cases
to
this
court
that
say
that
even
in
the
judicial
system,
stare
decisis
is
not
an
invariable
and
overriding
rule.
what
arbitrator
barrett
did
was
to
give
the
greatest
weight
and
attention
to
the
sabella
award,
and
he
said...
if
i
may,
he
said,
"in
my
heart"--
mr.
laurence
gold
--he
said,
"in
my
heart
i
cannot
believe
that
this
award
is
correct.
"
"i
do
not
believe
that
i
would
be
fulfilling
my
commission
if
i
followed
it.
"
"therefore,
i
do
not
do
so,
and
i
decide
this
matter
on
the
agreement,
on
its
language,
and
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
"
his
opinion
is
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
it
is,
i
think
you
will
agree,
a
very
thorough
and
reasoned
effort
to
come
to
grips
with
the
issue.
the
next
question
is,
what
does
a
court,
faced
with
the
barrett
award,
supposed
to
do.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
answer
to
that
varies
at
different
stages
of
the
proceeding.
many
arbitrators
follow
the
premise
that
the
public
law
is
the
public
law,
and
the
contract
is
the
contract,
and
they
are
only
charged
as
private
law--
mr.
laurence
gold
--right.
private
and
law
enforcement
officials
to
interpret
the
contract,
that
is
what
the
parties
bargain
for.
they
want
an
interpretation
of
the
contract.
the
law
is
perfectly
well
settled,
however,
that
if
an
arbitration
award
is
contrary
to
public
law,
the
courts
will
set
it
aside.
so
that
is
why
i
say
that
it
depends
at
different
stages--
we
have
noted
in
our
brief,
and
there
is
simply
no
room,
i
think,
either
in
theory
or
in
terms
of
this
court's
precedents,
that
an
arbitration
award
that
is
contrary
to
title
vii
is
no
good.
the
question
we
have
here
posed
by
the
government
is
whether
an
arbitration
award
that
accords
with
title
vii
somehow
is
subordinate
to
the
eeoc
on
what
title
vii
might
and
ought
to
be.
on
that
we
most
definitely
part
company
with
the
agency.
but
in
terms
of
the
question
you
raised,
there
is
discord
and
division
at
the
arbitral
stage,
but
none
at
all
at
the
judicial
stage,
or
in
this
court's
precedents.
as
i
started
to
say,
we
believe
that
the
proper
approach
in
evaluating
what
arbitrator
barrett
did
with
regard
to
the
sabella
award
is
stated
in
enterprise
wheel.
did
the
second
arbitrator,
the
arbitrator,
whose
award
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
satisfy,
draw
the
essence
of
his
award
from
the
contract?
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
yes,
we
believe
the
proceeding
is
at
an
end.
we
suggest
that
if
that
rule
is
not
the
rule,
enterprise
wheel
would
be
severely
cut
back
to
the
detriment
of
the
arbitration
system
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
contract
system...
i
mean
the
judicial
system,
for
it
is
a
very
rare
situation
in
which
there
has
only
been
one
arbitration
that
can
even
be
said
to
arguably
touch
on
an
issue
of
contract
interpretation.
if
the
courts,
either
in
this
proceeding
or
generally,
are
called
upon
to
say,
in
general,
interpreting
the
contract
is
for
the
arbitrator,
but
it
is
for
us
on
a
de
novo
theory
to
determine
whether
the
arbitrator
correctly
interpreted
the
final
and
binding
clause
which
is
no
more
or
less
a
part
of
the
agreement
than
any
other.
i
can
guarantee
you
that
all
the
cases
that
used
to
come
up
to
court
on
the
theory
that
the
enterprise
standard
had
not
been
met,
that
the
arbitrator
had
failed
to
draw
the
essence
of
his
award
from
the
contract,
will
now
come
to
the
courts
on
a
new
theory
to
take
advantage
of
the
broader
and
more
generous
scope
of
judicial
review,
namely,
that
the
award
is
inconsistent
with
the
prior
award,
or
that
the
arbitrator
misinterpreted
his
obligations
under
the
final
and
binding
section
of
the
contract.
we
believe
that
that
would
be
directly
contrary
to
congress's
intent
in
sections
203(d)
and
301,
and
to
the
sound
administration
of
this
system
of
law.
now
we
come
to
the
supposed
default
of
the
union
which
would
preclude
a
consideration
of
the
argument
i
have
just
made,
an
argument,
i
would
note,
that
is
nowhere
answered
on
its
merits
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
company,
a
very
thorough
and
able
reply
brief.
to
go
back
to
the
starting
point.
this
law
suit
is
not
a
law
suit
by
the
union.
this
is
a
law
suit
by
the
company,
brought
by
the
company
to
set
aside
an
arbitration
award.
the
company
had
a
theory.
the
company
came
into
court
and
said:
there
is
arbitration
award
no.
1,
the
sabella
award,
and
arbitration
no.
2,
the
barrett
award.
unless
arbitration
award
no.
1
is
not
in
the
refined
terms
used
here,
not
subject
to
being
overturned
in
court,
then
arbitration
award
no.
2
is
no
good.
that
was
the
essence
of
the
company's
theory.
the
union's
brief,
which
the
court,
of
course,
asked
us
for
a
copy
of
and
which
all
parties
have,
dealt
with
that
argument
in
two
parts.
part
no.
1,
looking
at
page
11
of
the
union's
court
of
appeals
brief
is
headed:
"arbitrator
sabella's
award
is
clearly
void
and
unenforceable,
and
entitled
to
no
binding
effect
on
subsequent
arbitrations
between
the
parties
as
a
result
of
arbitrator
sabella
exceeding
his
contractual
authority.
"
the
next
argument
is:
"arbitrator
barrett
acted
within
his
jurisdictional
authority
in
determining
the
effect
of
arbitrator
sabella's
earlier
award.
"
i
would
be
less
than
candid,
and
also
i
don't
bear
the
burden
of
having
had
to
deal
with
this
case
under
the
time
schedules
and
exigencies
of
lower
court
deadlines,
if
i
did
not
squarely
admit
that
the
link
between
argument
one
and
argument
two
is
not
made
with
complete
precision.
i
am
afraid
that
in
the
eye
of
god
i
won't
be
able
to
link
those
with
absolute
precision
either.
mr.
laurence
gold
counsel,
to
my
understanding,
has
gone
on
to
greater
and
better
things.
he
is
now
representing
companies.
0
[generallaughter.]
not
as
a
reward
in
any
way
for
his
misconduct
in
representing
us.
the
problem
in
terms
of
the
link
between
argument
one
and
argument
two
is
what
standard
should
arbitrator
barrett's
award
be
judged
by.
we
have
endeavored
here
in
our
brief
and
on
argument
to
state
that
standard
with
as
much
exactness
as
we
can.
that
was
not
done
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
simply
was
not
done,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
a
defendant
by
taking
on
the
arguments
made
by
a
plaintiff
and
dealing
with
them
in
turn,
and
by
failing
to
spell
out
the
precise
standard...
the
precise
interrelation
between
his
answers
to
the
different
portions
of
the
plaintiff's
argument
ought
to
be
said
to
have
conceded
anything.
we
believe
as
well,
in
terms
of
the
proper
approach
to
this
court,
that
those
who
are
defending
a
judgment
have
the
right,
and
it
may
well
be
the
duty,
to
state
the
principles
of
law
which
best
accord
with
the
statutory
materials
and
this
court's
precedents.
it
is
often
true,
and
it
is
part
of
the
system
we
believe,
that
as
a
case
moves
through
the
successive
stages
that
due
process
provides
for
and
that
congress
has
provided
for,
arguments
become
sharper
and
cleaner.
it
would
be
a
terrible
indictment
of
those
who
have
the
opportunity
to
present
cases
at
a
higher
level
if
they
didn't
try
to
learn
from
what
has
gone
before.
we
don't
believe
that
there
was
any
concession
of
fact
here.
we
don't
believe
there
was
concession
of
law
here.
but
if
we
are
wrong,
and
if
the
union
failed
to
sharpen
up
the
issue
by
saying
that
the
real
question
here
is:
should
arbitrator
barrett's
award
be
judged,
insofar
as
it
deals
with
the
final
and
binding
clause,
be
judged
de
novo,
or
should
it
be
judged
on
an
enterprise
standard?
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
concession
which
prevents
this
court
in
developing
the
law
from
developing
it
according
to
sound
principle
or
prevents
us
from
arguing
the
matter
in
a
way
which
is
sound
and
rational,
and
may
help
in
that
process.
in
preparing
for
the
argument
after
reading
the
reply
brief,
we
came
across
a
case
which
i'd
just
like
to
note,
called
orloff
versus
willoughby,
345
u.s.
83.
it
is
an
opinion
from
the
court
by
justice
jackson
and
let
me
just--
mr.
laurence
gold
--thank
you,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
the
respondents
after
that
dance
were
permitted
to
argue
the
case
on
its
merits,
and
the
respondents
prevailed
there.
we
hope
we
will
be
given
that
opportunity
and
we
hope
that
we
succeed
as
well
as
the
government
did
in
that
case.
we
think
that
what
is
said
there
is
the
proper
approach
to
appellate
litigation.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
apologize,
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
would
be
an
interesting
sight.
these
are
the
rubber
workers,
and
we
hope
that
they
do
as
well.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
third
of
the
questions
that
i
have
listed
concerns
the
effect
of
the
district
court's
order
on
companies'
contract
liabilities.
the
company
argues
that
the
proper
rule
is
that
once
the
district
court
entered
its
order,
the
company
could
not
be
held
liable
for
contract
damages.
like
the
first
of
the
questions
presented,
we
believe
that
that
was
a
contract
question
for
arbitrator
barrett
to
decide.
the
question
of
when
a
court
order
is,
for
want
of
a
better
term,
the
basis
of
a
claim
of
impossibility
of
performance
which
relieves
one
of
paying
damages
for
a
contract
breach
is
not
a
de
novo
one.
the
general
law
is
that
such
an
order
provides
an
impossibility
defense
only
if
the
party
claiming
that
defense
has
not
been
at
any
fault
in
securing
the
order.
the
company
plainly
can't
satisfy
that
standard
here.
the
original
suit
was
brought
by
the
company.
the
company
amended
its
original
complaint
to
allege
that
the
conciliation
agreement
was
superior
to
the
collective
agreement.
i
skipped
a
step.
the
company
entered
into
the
conciliation
agreement
after
the
collective
agreement.
the
company
amended
its
complaint
to
say
that
the
conciliation
agreement
was
superior.
the
company
aligned
itself
with
the
eeoc,
when
the
eeoc
sought
an
order
to
prevent
execution
of
the
collective
agreement
and
to
prevent
the
arbitration.
the
company,
like
the
union,
sought
no
stay
of
the
district
court
order
that
was
eventually
entered.
certainly,
in
terms
of
the
equitable
standard
used
in
general,
the
company
cannot
invoke
that
defense
as
arbitrator
barrett
concluded.
moreover,
this
agreement
has
an
express
savings
clause
which
provides
that
the
agreement
is
not
enforceable
if
contrary
to
law
and,
as
matters
have
turned
out,
this
agreement
is
not
contrary
to
law.
the
collective
agreement
is
not
contrary
to
law.
that
being
true,
and
against
the
background
stated,
again
we
believe
that
judged
as
it
ought
to
be
judged
under
the
enterprise
standard,
what
arbitrator
barrett
concluded,
namely,
that
the
company
should
not
be
relieved
of
its
contract
liability
is
correct.
the
company
argues
here
that
collective
agreements
are
not
commercial
agreements.
we
could
not
agree
more,
but
nothing
comes
of
that
in
our
view
that
is
any
help
to
the
company
because
in
this
court's
cases,
and
most
particularly
the
carbon
fuel
case
in
444
u.s.,
the
court
has
made
it
plain
that
congress's
point
in
enacting
section
301,
and
indeed
the
point
overall
of
the
national
labor
policy,
is
to
provide
for
stability
through
free
collective
bargaining
and
to
provide
that
agreements
once
reached
are
to
be
followed.
so
long
as
they
are
lawful,
they
are
to
be
followed
without
administrative
intervention,
without
executive
intervention,
and
without
judicial
intervention.
we
would
think
that
the
general
contract
rule,
which
embodies
a
good
deal
of
wisdom
in
itself,
applies
with
a
vengeance
in
the
situation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
laurence
gold
that,
justice
o'connor,
turns
me
to
the
last
of
what
i
have
labeled
the
four
questions
which
concerns
the
effect
of
the
conciliation
agreement.
first
of
all,
as
i
attempted
to
state
at
an
earlier
point
in
answering
justice
rehnquist's
question,
we
have
no
doubt
that
any
collective
agreement
that
is
contrary
to
title
vii
simply
cannot
be
enforced.
if
the
company,
having
taken
the
gamble
it
did
against
the
background
of
the
law,
had
been
proved
right,
this
agreement
would
not
have
been...
the
collective
agreement
would
not
have
been
subject
to
enforcement.
arbitrator
barrett's
award
would
have
been
subject
to
having
been

title
vii.
mr.
laurence
gold
absolutely.
but
we
believe
that
it
strains
title
vii
far
past
the
breaking
point
to
say
that
the
eeoc,
which
congress
did
not
give
the
power
to
adjudicate
claims
or
to
enter
orders...
i
just
was
looking
for
words
of
alexander
versus
gardner
denver...
the
commission
cannot
adjudicate
claims
or
impose
administrative
sanctions.
it
would
be
extraordinarily
surprising
and
wholly
irrational
to
conclude
that
the
eeoc
can
nonetheless
enter
into
a
conciliation
agreement
with
a
by
which
b's
rights...
contract
rights
are
destroyed,
and
to
say
that
that
conciliation
agreement,
even
though
it
can't
stand
the
test
of
being
placed
against
the
law
in
a
court,
is
superior
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
think
that
not
only
did
congress
not
grant
any
such
broad
powers
to
the
commission,
but
as
this
court
has
noted
and
most
recently
in
the
california
brewers
case,
again
in
444
u.s.,
title
vii
was
drafted
against
the
background
of
the
national
labor
policy.
as
the
court
said
there,
"it
does
not
behoove
the
courts
to
second
guess
the
processes
of
collective
bargaining.
"
certainly
this
agency
was
not
given
the
power
to
second
guess
those
processes.
it
was
given
the
power
to
take
people
into
court
if
they
could
not
arrange
a
conciliation
and
to
demonstrate
that
what
they
had
was
wrong.
only
after
that
is
done,
only
after
the
courts
have
made
the
findings
of
fact
necessary,
is
there
room
for
a
binding
court
order
which
denies
somebody
a
contract
right
or
a
right
derived
from
any
other
source.
in
concluding,
i
would
like
to
address
the
point
that
somehow
that
view
will
end
the
conciliation
system
with
regard
to
situations
involving
collective
bargaining
agreements.
there
is
no
substance
to
that
because
this
is
not
a
zero-sum
game
where
only
the
employer
is
at
jeopardy.
if
the
union
was
presented
with
the
conciliation
here,
and
it
took
the
view
that
the
agreement,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
lawful
and
it
wanted
to
stick
with
it--
mr.
laurence
gold
--well,
in
the
situations
of
that
kind,
your
honor,
what
i
understand
the
law
to
be
is
that
the
courts
have
ample
power
in
determining
who
has...
who
bears
the
liabilities
stemming
from
an
unlawful
collective
agreement,
to
impose
those
liabilities
on
whoever
is
at
fault.
if
an
employer
either
said,
"we
want
to
change
this
contract.
"
or
said,
"we
want
to
enter
into
a
conciliation
agreement.
"
the
union
is
put
at
great
jeopardy
if
it
does
not
agree
to
do
so.
so
the
imperatives
for
the
union
to
enter
into
the
conciliation
process
in
many
cases
are
precisely
the
same
as
the
imperatives
that
drive
anyone
into
conciliation,
a
desire
to
bring
one's
situation
into
conformity
with
law,
a
desire
to
avoid
the
cost
of
litigation,
costs
which
most
unions
are
not
in
as
good
a
position
as
most
companies
to
deal
with,
and
a
desire
to
safeguard
against
potential
liabilities.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
see,
your
honor.
i
apologize.
i
missed
the
point
of
your
first
hypothetical
and
i
apologize.
as
i
understand
the
procedural
situation
in
cases
of
that
kind,
in
any
such
case
the
union
at
the
least
would
be
a
rule
19
defendant
and
be
entitled
to
argue
for
and
to
defend
the
legality
of
the
contract.
i
was
envisioning
a
situation
in
which
both
parties
recognized
that
they
had
an
unlawful
contract.
clearly,
what
is
the
essence
of
our
concern
about
the
last
of
the
arguments
the
company
makes
is
that
it
is
designed
to
either
force
the
union
to
attack
a
conciliation
agreement
to
get
into
court,
or
to
deny
a
union,
which
believes
that
its
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
lawful
which
has
the
contract
rights
of
those
who
are
covered
by
the
agreement
to
defend,
any
opportunity
to
defend
them.
we
don't
believe
that
title
vii
denies
unions
that
opportunity
or
takes
away
contract
rights
in
that
way,
and
we
would
have
the
gravest
due
process
doubts
of
the
validity
of
any
statute
which
had
the
effect
of
taking
these
contract
rights
away
through
an
agreement
between
the
government
and
