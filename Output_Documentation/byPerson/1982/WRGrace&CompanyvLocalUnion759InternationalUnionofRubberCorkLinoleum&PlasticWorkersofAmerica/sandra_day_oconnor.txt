mr.
nash,
there
does
seem
to
be
language
in
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
union
in
the
court
of
appeals
that,
although
not
crystal
clear,
would
seem
to
be
contrary
to
your
position
and
would
indicate
there
was
not
a
waiver
of
the
issue
on
the
barrett/sabella
award
question.
certainly
language
in
their
brief
which
i
have
examined
would
indicate
that
it
wasn't
waived.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
respond
to
the
s.g.'s
position
that,
surely,
you
should
not
be
freed
from
having
the
requirements
of
title
vii
imposed?
