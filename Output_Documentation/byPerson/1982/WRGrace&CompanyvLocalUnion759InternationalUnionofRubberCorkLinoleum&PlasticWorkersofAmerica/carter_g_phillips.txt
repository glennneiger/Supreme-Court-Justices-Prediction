mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
i
note
that
the
government
will
only
address
the
third
issue
presented
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
because
that
is
the
only
issue
in
which
the
government
has
a
particular
interest.
we
do
note
that
the
resolution
of
the
third
issue
is
itself
contingent
on
the
proper
disposition
of
the
first
two
questions.
if
the
court
decides
either
of
the
first
two
issues
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
then
there
will
be
no
reason
to
address
the
issue
of
special
concern
to
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
in
this
case.
the
commission
is
the
federal
agency
vested
with
the
primary
duty
under
title
vii
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
the
workplace.
in
performing
this
mission,
congress
expressly
obliged
the
commission
to
attempt
in
the
first
instance
to
conciliate
employment
discrimination
disputes
in
order
to
resolve
them,
if
at
all
possible,
without
having
to
resort
to
judicial
proceedings.
through
this
informal
conciliation
process,
the
commission
every
year
resolves
literally
hundreds
of
cases,
in
some
years
even
thousands
of
cases,
without
having
to
consume
a
single
second
of
judicial
time.
conciliation
is
thus
properly
regarded
both
by
congress
and
the
commission
as
the
most
appropriate
means
of
resolving
employment
discrimination
disputes.
indeed,
it
is
central
to
the
commission's
ability
to
perform
its
mission,
given
the
large
number
of
title
vii
cases
that
come
before
the
commission
and
the
relatively
limited
resources
the
commission
has
to
dispose
of
those
cases.
the
commission
submits
that
it
is
central
to
its
ability
to
conciliate
disputes
that
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
conflict
with
arguable
requirements
of
title
vii
must
be
set
aside,
and
that
the
conciliation
agreement
that
is
reached
must
be
given
a
place
of
preeminence.
thus,
to
the
extent
that
an
arbitrator
grants
the
union
compensation
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
caused
by
the
employer's
reliance
on
a
reasonable
conciliation
agreement,
that
award
must
be
vacated
on
review
by
a
federal
court.
in
taking
this
position,
the
commission
appreciates
the
importance
to
the
national
labor
policy
both
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
general
and
of
arbitrations.
but
what
is
equally
obvious
is
the
importance
of
the
national
policy
under
title
vii
of
eliminating
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
of
remedying
completely
the
effects
of
discrimination.
both
policies
govern
employment
relationships.
obviously,
they
have
overlapping
coverage.
in
some
instances
they
conflict.
in
six
circumstances
where
the
title
vii
requirements
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
conflict,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
requirements
of
title
vii
must
prevail.
in
the
emporium
capwell
decision,
the
court
expressly
stated
that
when
the
agreement
of
the
union
and
the
employer
conflict
with
the
law,
even
though
that
law
is
found
by
means
of
the
conciliation
efforts
of
the
commission,
the
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
union
must
be
set
aside.
our
submission
is
that
that
ruling
or
that
statement
must
apply
just
as
much
in
the
process
of
a
conciliation
agreement
based
on
a
reasonable
determination
of
what
the
law
requires
at
the
time
of
the
conciliation
as
it
would
if
this
issue
were
finally
settled
by
this
court.
in
our
view,
in
following
reasonable
conciliation
agreements
in
disregard
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreements,
the
best
balance
is
the
relevant
interest
at
stake
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
the
result
is
proper
primarily
because
it
encourages
settlements
with
employers
that
otherwise
might
be
deterred.
in
addition,
the
process
of
following
the
conciliation
agreements
serves
as
a
significant
prod
to
the
union
to
have
it
involved
in
the
conciliation
process.
third,
the
expectations
of
the
incumbent
employees
are
adequately--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--maybe
not
as
strong
a
case,
although
i
don't
think
those
facts
differ...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
that
we
would
set
aside
the
conciliation
agreement
simply
because
the
union
declines
to
participate
in
the
process.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
true
that
this
court's
decision
in
teamsters
cast
some
doubt
on
the
conciliation
agreement,
although
it
is
still
an
open
question
whether
the
kind
of
relief
granted
in
the
conciliation
agreement
might
otherwise
have
been
permissible
as
a
remedy
for
any
kind
of
hiring
discrimination.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that
is
true,
that
is
true,
although
again
there
was
a
finding
of
reasonable
cause
to
believe
there
had
been
hiring
discrimination,
and
then
whether
or
not
in
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
where
you
have
immediate
layoffs,
it
might
well
have
been
regarded
at
that
time
as
a
basis
for
modifying
the
layoff
procedures,
that
is
all.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
the
eeoc's
compliance
manual
expressly
provides
that
notice
should
be
given
to
the
union
at
any
time
it
appears
that
provisions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
conflict
with
proposed
conciliation
efforts.
the
union
is
invited
routinely
to
come
in
and
participate.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
am
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
of
title
vii?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
presumably,
although
there
was
no
charge
against
the
union,
so
it
would
have
been
difficult...
they
would
not
have
been
within
the
proceeding
itself
since
they
had
not
been
charged
with
violating
title
vii,
although
it
does
seem
that
there
is
a
concert
of
action
of
sorts
that
leads
to
the
result
that
there
are
no
women
in
the
production
units
at
the
southbridge
plant.
we
suggest
that
the
relevant
interests
of
the
various
parties
at
stake,
in
this
case
we
submit,
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
conciliation
agreement
ought
to
be
followed.
we
have
already
discussed
the
union's
interest
in
this
case,
in
having
them
participate
in
the
negotiation
process.
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
realize
that
the
incumbent
employees'
interests
in
this
case
are
not
violated
by
virtue
of
following
the
conciliation
agreement
in
most
instances
because,
as
in
this
case,
the
original
award
in
this
case
followed
at
that
point
the
judicial
decree,
but
presumably
might
very
well
have
followed
the
conciliation
agreement
itself
as
a
reasonable
statement
of
what
the
law
required.
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
contains
an
illegality
clause
in
it,
and
thus
the
reasonable
expectations
of
the
employees
must
be
that
their
collective
bargaining
rights
must
give
way
if
federal
law
otherwise
requires.
accordingly,
by
following
the
conciliation
agreement
no
real
violence
is
ofttimes
done
to
the
arbitral
process
at
all.
on
the
other
hand,
by
following
the
arbitral
process,
the
employer
is
completely
deprived
of
any
opportunity
for
some
sort
of
a
safe
harbor
that
has
been
called
into
question
by
the
eeoc's
action
in
asking
them
to
agree
to
a
particular
agreement
and,
in
turn,
it
will
serve
as,
i
think,
a
clear
deterrent
in
most
future
cases
for
any
employer
to
agree
to
any
form
of
conciliation
agreement
that
requires
modification
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
result,
we
submit,
is
just
unwarranted
in
this
context.
the
federal
policy
of
high
settlement
of
title
vii
suits
should
be
the
controlling
factor
in
this
case.
since
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
disregards
the
conciliation
agreement
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
and
uphold
the
second
award
strictly
on
the
basis
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
we
submit
that
that
decision
must
be
reversed.
are
there
any
questions?
