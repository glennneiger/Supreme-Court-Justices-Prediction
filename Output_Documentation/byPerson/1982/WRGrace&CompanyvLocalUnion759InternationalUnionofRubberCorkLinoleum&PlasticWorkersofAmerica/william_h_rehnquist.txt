justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nash,
you
said
the
union
had
notice.
does
that
suggest
or
do
you
think
that
the
union
was
bound
by
what
the
company
agreed
to
with
the
eeoc?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the
intimation
of
the
company's
position
that
both
of
them
could
not
apply?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
the
company
take
that
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
company
can
bind
itself
with
the
eeoc,
and
i
should
think
still
continue
to
be
bound
with
the
union.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
where
you
get
the
concept
of
tension.
employer
a
can
make
an
agreement
to
buy
1,000
bottles
from
a
contractor,
and
then
he
can
go
and
make
an
agreement
with
another
contractor
to
buy
10,000
bottles.
he
may
not
be
able
to
use
both
shipments
of
bottles,
but
he
is
bound
to
both
of
the
people
that
he
has
contracted
with.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
eeoc
agreement
under
these
circumstances
binds
the
union?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
a
moment
ago
in
answer
to
my
question
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
union
had
notice
didn't
result
in
binding
the
union.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
the
position
you
have
just
stated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
a
case
from
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
another
case
from
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
zipes
is
your
authority
from
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
employer
conciliates
with
the
eeoc,
he
can
repudiate
any
inconsistent
agreements
he
has
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
that
cause
of
action
be
decided?
what
standard
of
law
would
govern
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
strip
it
down
even
further,
mr.
nash.
isn't
the
basic
issue
here
whether
arbitrator
barrett's
award
should
be
enforced
under
the
enterprise
doctrine?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
concession
is
really
partly
one
of
fact
and
partly
one
of
law,
isn't
it?
certainly,
if
there
is
a
concession
as
a
fact,
the
parties
are
bound
by
it.
i
don't
think
parties'
concessions
of
law
bind
this
court
or
any
other
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
before
you
get
to
the
court
stage,
is
there
any
established
doctrine
under
301
and
arbitrations
as
to
what
public
law
limitations
there
may
be
on
an
arbitrator's
award?
supposing
you
have
the
southern
steamship
case
versus
nlrb,
but
instead
of
before
the
nlrb,
it
is
before
an
arbitrator
and
the
arbitrator
orders
a
shipping
employer
to
reinstate
mutineers.
would
that
be
judged
by
exactly
the
same
standard,
simply
purely
contractual
as
any
other
award?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
never
the
twain
shall
meet?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
footnote
21
at
the
bottom
of
page
15
in
your
brief
indicate
counsel
has
been
penalized
for
his
failings
in
that
regard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
parties
have
changed
position
as
nimbly
as
if
they
were
dancing
a
quadrille.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
true
even
if
there
had
been
no
conciliation
agreement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
the
injunction
simply
an
injunction
against
arbitration,
and
wasn't
that
injunction
obeyed
by
the
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
more
did
the
injunction
say?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
part
of
the
injunction?
