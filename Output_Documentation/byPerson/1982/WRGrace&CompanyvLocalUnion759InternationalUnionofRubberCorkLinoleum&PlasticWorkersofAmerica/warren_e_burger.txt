we
will
now
hear
argument
next
in
w.
r.
grace
company
against
a
local
of
the
international
union.
mr.
nash,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
phillips.
chief

mr.

chief

suppose,
mr.
gold,
that
instead
of
joining
in
that
conciliation
agreement,
the
employer
had
said,
"i
want
to
protect
my
flanks.
"
and
takes
it
to
court.
then
they
went
into
court.
let's
take
one
hypothesis.
first,
the
employer
put
in
their
defense,
and
then
the
decree
was
entered.
what
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
change
that
hypothetical
just
a
little.
instead
of
simply
putting
in
no
evidence,
the
employer
had
stipulated
that
the
conciliation
agreement
could
be
the
basis
for
a
judgment
of
the
court,
in
other
words,
a
stipulated
judgment.
so
that
the
only
difference
from
this
situation
that
we
have
is
that
the
conciliation
agreement
would
have
been
ratified.
chief

do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
nash?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
i
had
made
my
hypothetical
slightly
different
from
what
occurred
here.
i
must
have
been
mistaken.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
my
hypothetical
precisely
what
was
done
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
its
effect,
it
is
the
same,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
okay,
gentlemen,
the
case
submitted.
