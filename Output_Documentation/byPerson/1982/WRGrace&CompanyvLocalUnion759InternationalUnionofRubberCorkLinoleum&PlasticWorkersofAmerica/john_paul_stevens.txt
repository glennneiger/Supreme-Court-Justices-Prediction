mr.
phillips,
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there.
you
talk
about
the
interest
in
getting
the
union
involved
in
the
conciliation
process.
what
if
they
called
up
the
union
and
said,
"we'd
like
you
to
attend
the
final
meeting
on
the
conciliation
agreement.
"
if
you
asked
them
directly
to
get
involved,
and
the
union
representative
came
over
and
said,
"well,
that's
fine,
except
i
think
our
contract
is
lawful
and
we
want
to
defend
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
"
"so
we
refuse
to
agree
to
any
change
in
it.
"
then,
notwithstanding
that,
they
entered
into
the
agreement
they
did.
do
you
think
you
would
have
as
strong
a
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though,
as
i
understand
it,
the
conciliation
agreement
is
founded
on
a
mistake
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
founded
on
the
assumption
that
the
seniority
provisions
were
unlawful,
which
of
course
turned
out
to
be
incorrect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
violation,
as
i
understand
it,
insofar
as
the
sex
discrimination
charge
is
concerned,
strictly
was
on
the
basis
that
the
seniority
provisions
were
unlawful,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
the
eeoc
policy
in
a
three-cornered
situation
like
this
just
to
ignore
the
third
party,
the
union,
or
to
get
them
involved
in
the
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
there
was
a
violation
here,
the
union
would
have
been
guilty
of
a
violation
as
well
as
the
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
premise
for
the
agreement,
namely,
illegality,
if
that
was
correct,
the
union
would
also
have
been
guilty
of
a
violation,
would
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
teamsters
are
relying
on
the
right
to
dance
a
quadrille?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
say,
the
teamsters
union...
is
this
the
teamsters
case?
no,
it
is
not
the
teamsters.
i
was
saying,
were
the
teamsters
wanting
to
dance
the
quadrille?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
your
court
order
argument.
supposing
that
there
was
a
case
in
which
a
was
order
to
pay
b
$100,000.
c
was
a
party
in
the
case
and
said:
you
really
owe
me
the
money,
not
to
b.
c
appeals
and
gets
a
reversal.
in
the
meantime
the
money
has
been
paid
to
b.
are
you
arguing
that
b
can
keep
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
see
how
that
case
is
different
from
yours.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
my
case,
it's
based
on
a
contract,
an
argument
about
what
a
contract
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
my
hypothetical,
and
as
a
result
the
judge
said,
b.>
["]
then
c
says,
"no,
the
money
is
mine.
"
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
that
b
can
keep
the
money.
i
am
afraid
that
i
don't
follow
that.
okay.
