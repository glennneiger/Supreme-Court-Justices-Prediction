mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
arbitration
is
to
become
the
effective
speedy
alternative
to
litigation
that
congress
intended
by
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
that
the
present
crunch
of
litigation
in
our
court
system
seems
to
compel,
then
we
believe
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
to
reverse
and
reinstate
the
district
court's
decision
would
undercut
the
vitality
and
viability
of
arbitration
as
an
alternative
to
court
litigation.
mercury,
my
client
in
this
case,
went
into
the
federal
court
and
filed
an
action
under
section
4
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
an
action
that
was
a
right
granted
to
it
by
congress
in
the
federal
arbitration
act.
and
that
section,
section
4,
says
that
if
you
establish
two
things,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
one,
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
and
two,
a
failure
on
the
other
party
to
arbitrate--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
believe--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--your
honor,
in
our
view
that
would
be
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
because
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
the
courts
are
charged
to...
if
they
find
an
agreement
to
arbitrate--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--your
honor,
as
the
federal
arbitration
act
has
developed
in
the
circuit
courts,
the
circuit
courts
have
developed
a
body
of
substantive
federal
law
for
the
purpose
of
interpreting
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
it
is
a
body
of
law
for
interpreting
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
agreements.
if,
for
example,
justice
white,--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--i
can
agree
with
you
very
easily,
your
honor,
that
if
it
says
disputes
involving
x
are
not
subject
to
arbitration,
then
clearly,
there's
no
agreement
to
arbitrate.
no
one
would
dispute
that.
and
if
the
arbitration
clause
says
this
clause
is
applicable
only
to
disputes
a,
b,
c
and
d,
then
that
is--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--i
believe
that
the...
i
believe
that
properly
interpreted,
the
federal
substantive
law
should
apply,
but
in
most
instances
that
would
be,
i
suspect,
the
adoption
of
state
law.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
that
would
be
a
contract
question.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
there
are
certain
situations
where
federal
courts
have,
in
effect,
adopted
a
federal
substantive
law
of
contracts.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
in
this
particular
situation
i
think
the
prima
paint
case--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--i
have
to...
i
will
agree,
your
honor,
that
prima
paint
did
not
deal
directly
with
that
question,
but
i
think
the
fair
inference
from
prima
paint
is
that
that
would
be
the
result.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
that
is
certainly
correct,
yes,
sir.
to
try
to
return
to
what
i
think
is
the
central
point
on
this
part
of
the
case,
congress
in
its
wisdom
gave
to
parties
to
agreements
to
arbitrate
the
right
to
go
into
federal
court
and
to
have
a
hearing.
and
if
based
on
that
hearing
the
federal
court
was
obligated...
if
it
found
that
there
was
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
if
it
found
that
there
was
a
failure
to
comply,
to
compel
arbitration.
if
this
court
has
a
serious
question
about
whether
or
not
there
was
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
which
we
don't
think
there
was...
the
fourth
circuit
certainly
didn't
have
any
problem
with
that...
but
if
that
is
a
question,
then
the
proper
remedy
would
be
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
and
direct
that
the
state
court
hold
a
hearing
on
that
question...
i
mean,
to
the
federal
court...
and
direct
the
federal
court
to
hold
a
hearing
on
that
question.
as
is
our
right
under
section
4
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
not
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is
that
generally,
the
federal
courts
are
far
more
familiar
with
the
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
second,
we
have
a
congressionally
granted
right
to
a
hearing
in
the
federal
courts
on
that
issue.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
form
of
relief,
although
i
don't
make
a
big
point
out
of
this,
the
form
of
relief
is
different.
under
section
4,
which
only
federal
district
courts
can
apply,
we
are
entitled
to
an
order
compelling
arbitration.
under
the
section
3,
which
would
be
the
federal
remedy
in
the
state
court
case,
the
remedy
there
is
to
stay
that
case,
pending
arbitration.
so
we
do
think
there
is
a
difference
in
the
remedies,
and
that
different
was
recognized
in
prima
paint.
for
example,
the
court
in
prima
paint
specifically
referred
to
section
4
as
applying
a
federal
remedy.
and
we
think
that
is
very
important
in
this
case.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
i
think
the
district
court
in
this
case,
in
a
sense,
abdicated
its
responsibility.
i
think
the
district
court
came
close
to
the
situation
in
thermtron,
in
this
case,
quite
frankly,
because
you
had
a
situation
where
the
court
was
obligated
to
proceed
forward.
section
4
is
written
in
very
mandatory
terms,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
feel
as
though
the
district
court
was
obligated
to
go
forward.
let
me
point
out
one
thing
if
i
might.
in
the
record,
it
is
very
clear
in
the
affidavits
that
were
filed
by
our
client
to
the
district
court,
it
is
clear
that
the
contractor
went
to
the
architect
during
the
course
of
construction
and
said
we
will
have
claims,
and
the
architect
said,
we
understand
you
will
have
claims,
and
we
request
that
you
withhold
the
filing
of
those
claims
until
after
construction
is
completed.
that
is
undisputed
in
the
record.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
that
renders
the
kind
of
argument
that
mr.
floyd
is
making
meaningless.
i
don't
agree
with
his
argument
to
start
with,
but
even
if
that
was
a
valid
argument,
his
condition
precedent
argument
in
this
case.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
your
honor,
in
the
record,
there's
also
an
affidavit
by
the
architect
which
says
if
he
had
made
a
decision
and
had
advised
the
hospital
of
that
decision,
that
may
client
was
entitled
to
be
paid
between
$600,000
and
$1,200,000
prior
to
the
time
that
the
hospital
went
into
state
court
in
north
carolina.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
been
our
view--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
misspoke.
it
was
not
before
him
at
the
time
we
presented
our
petition.
it
was
before
him
at
the
time
that
he
ruled
on
the
petition.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
they
did
not.
to
proceed,--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
page
40,
as
i
recall,
your
honor.
yes,
it's
mr.
ward's
affidavit
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
38
through
40.
i
might
proceed
forward.
and
i
think
the
factual
background
of
this
case
is
important
because
i
think
the
factual
background
of
this
case
gets
to
the
other
issue,
both
issues,
which
is
the
issue
of
appealability
or
finality,
and
to
the
issue
of
the
judge's
right
to
stay.
in
this
situation,
as
i
said,
mercury
had
notified
the
architect
of
the
claims
and
had
been
advised
to
hold
off.
we
did.
we
then
gave
the
hospital
notice
of
the
claims
and
over
a
period
of
months,
there
was
conversation
between
the
hospital
and
our
client
about
those
claims.
as
the
record
will
show,
and
as
the
uncontested
affidavit
of
mr.
bynam
in
the
record
will
show,
a
meeting
had
been
set
between
the
parties
for
further
discussion
of
the
claims.
and
when
that
meeting
was
a
week
off,
we
called
to
confirm
the
meeting,
the
hospital
said
well,
we'll
call
you
back
in
a
few
days
and
let
you
know.
they
called
back
in
two
days
and
said
we're
filing
a
lawsuit
against
you
tomorrow
in
state
court,
taking
the
position
that
you
have
failed
to
arbitrate.
justices,
at
that
time
we
had
no
right
to
file
our
suit
in
federal
court
under
section
4.
until
that
time.
one
of
the
conditions
of
section
4
relief
is
the
failure
of
the
other
party
to
comply
with
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
until
the
hospital
went
into
the
state
court
we
had
no
notice
that
they
would
fail
to
comply
with
the
arbitration
agreement.
that
was
our
first
notice.
mr.
floyd
in
his
argument
said
that
we
waited
for
three
weeks
to
proceed
with
our
section
4
petition.
he's
right,
we
did
wait
for
three
weeks,
and
the
reason
we
waited
for
three
weeks
was
that
the
hospital
went
to
the
state
court
ex
parte
without
notice
to
us
and
obtained
an
injunction
from
a
north
carolina
court
enjoining
our
client
from
seeking
to
enforce
its
rights
to
arbitration.
we
had
that
decision
set
aside
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions
in
atomic
general
and
other
cases,
donovan
and
atomic
general.
and
then
immediately
proceeded
to
file
our
section
4
petition.
what
happened
when
the
district
court
stayed
the
section
4
petition
was
that
he,
in
effect,
finally
determined
that
my
client
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
hearing
that
congress
had
guaranteed
it
under
section
4
of
the
act.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
your
honor,
i
suppose
that
it
is
conceivable
that
the
state
court
could
have
done
nothing
whatsoever
and
that
we
would
have
attempted
to
come
back
in
and
have
the
stay
lifted.
i
also
assume
that
it's
possible
that
the
state
court
could
have
ruled
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
didn't
apply,
and
that
we
could
have
tried
to
come
back
in
and
have
the
stay
lifted.
but
i
think
that
those
are
two
fairly
extreme
circumstances,
and
certainly
as
a
practical
matter...
i
think
the
fourth
circuit
was
right
that
as
a
practical
matter,
assuming
that
the
state
court
is
going
to
move
with
any
kind
of
dispatch,
that
what
has
really
happened
is
that
the
federal
court
has
denied
us
the
right
to
have
our
section
4
right
enforced
in
the
federal
court.
i
can
conceive
of
examples
of
where
that
wouldn't
happen,
but
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
justice
rehnquist,
that
belies
the
reality
of
the
situation.
and
i
might
point
out
two
other
things
at
this
point.
one
is
that
the
stay
order
did
not
say
i
am
staying
the
section
4
case
pending
a
determination
of
the
question
as
to
arbitrability.
it
said
i
am
staying
the
section
4
case
pending
a
determination
of
the
entire
case
pending
in
a
north
carolina
court.
the
second
thing
is
that
at
the
time
the
district
court
made
its
ruling,
it
had
before
it
affidavits
that
had
been
filed
on
the
issue
of
arbitration
under
section
4,
which
is
the
normal
way
in
my
experience
that
that
issue
is
dealt
with.
and
the
issue
had
been
fully
briefed.
no
such
affidavits
and
no
such
briefing
had
taken
place
in
the
state
court.
so
at
that
particular
point
in
time,
more
activity
had
occurred
in
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court,
than
had
occurred
in
the
state
court.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
the
fourth
circuit
found,
the
district
court
had
before
it
all
the
information
that
it
needed
or
was
necessary
to
make
an
order
that
our
client
was
entitled
to
arbitration
and
that
the
district
court
should
have
compelled
arbitration.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
i
believe
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
almost
every
court
that
i'm
aware
of
that
has
ruled
on
that
question
has
held
that
that
is
an
issue
for--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
decisions
and
almost
every
final
state
court
that
has
ultimately
reached
that
question
are
consistent
in
that
regard.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
that's
an
issue
that's
almost,
without
fail,
decided
by
the
arbitrators.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
as
long
as
the
contract
in
which
the
arbitration
clause
is
contained
is
a
contract
that
affects
commerce,
as
defined
within
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that's
a
necessary
predicate
to
proceeding.
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
minute
to
the
question
of
appealability
under
section
1291.
as
i
said
in
my
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
questions,
i
believe
that
as
a
practical
matter,
and
looking
at
the
realities
of
the
situation,
the
district
court's
stay
order
effectively
terminated
our
client's
petition
under
section
4
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
to
compel
arbitration
and
denied
us
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
that
petition.
in
so
holding,
the
fourth
circuit,
in
our
view,
followed
the
rule
of
this
court
that
has
been
applied
for
many
years,
and
that
is
that
finality
is
to
be
given
a
practical
rather
than
a
technical
construction.
the
underpinning
or
the
basis
for
the
finality
rule,
as
stated
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
is
that
you
will
not
have
piecemeal
reviews.
piecemeal
reviews
during
the
process
of
a
case.
not
piecemeal
litigation,
not
the
matter
of
whether
we've
got
two
cases
going
on,
but
a
piecemeal
review
in
the
case
that
we're
talking
about.
in
this
situation,
the
order
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court
effectively
stopped
that
case
forever.
and
there
is
no
piecemeal
review
by
my
client
when
we
went
to
the
fourth
circuit.
what
we
went
to
the
fourth
circuit
for
was
to
have
a
determination
on
the
only
issue
that
existed
in
the
case,
and
that
is:
will
we
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
before
the
district
court
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
were
entitled
to
an
order
compelling
arbitration.
that's
the
only
issue.
this
is
not
like
the
many
other
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
where
you
had
a
collateral
issue,
like
in
livesay.
you
had
an
issue
that
deals
with
the
class.
but
the
underlying
action
of
the
plaintiff
could
still
go
forward,
as
this
court
found.
and
in
other
cases
before
this
court.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
your
honor,
but
that
underlying
cause
of
action
still
exists.
in
our
case,
when
the
district
court
acted
as
it
did,
then
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
is
forever
settled.
once
the
state
court
goes
off
and
rules
on
that
question,
then
there's
nothing
left
for
us
to
do.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
if
the
state
court
sat
on
it
for
a
long
time,
the
district
court
might.
but
even
in
that
situation,
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
denied
the
remedy
that
congress
in
its
wisdom
said
that
i
should
have
under
section
4
of
the
act.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
the
state
court
does
not...
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
justice
o'connor,
only
the
federal
court
can
issue
an
order
compelling
arbitration.
under
section
3
any
court
in
which
an
action
is
pending
has
the
right
to
stay
that
action
pending
arbitration.
i
don't
want
to
make
a...
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction,
and
as
i
said
it's
a
distinction
that
was
recognized
in
prima
paint,
it
was
also
a
distinction
that
this
court
recognized
in
the
shenferough
case
back
in
the
1930s.
so
i
think
it's
a
distinction
with
meaning.
it's
not
a
meaningless
distinction.
i
might
add
that
north
carolina,
after
this
case
was
decided
by
the
district
court,
did
enter
a
case
that
said
the
federal
arbitration
act
would
be
the
law
of
that
state,
but
there
are
other
states
at
this
time
that
do
not
do
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
own
state
of
alabama
does
not
recognize
it
right
now,
and
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota,
in
a
recent
case
decided
this
summer,
the
thayer
case,
has
held
that
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
not
to
apply
even
though
commerce
was
admitted
in
that
case.
so,
i
think
we've
got
a
mixed
bag
of
ways
in
which
states
might
or
might
not
rule
on
these
questions,
and
we
think
it
is
very
important
if
arbitration
is
to
become
a
meaningful
way
to
deal
with
disputes,
commercial
disputes,
that
it
is
very
important
that
to
the
extent
possible
and
to
the
extent
that
jurisdiction
is
granted
to
them,
that
the
federal
courts
deal
with
arbitration
questions
and
develop
a
body
of
law
that
will
be
uniform
and
will
put
some
meaning
out
of
what,
quite
frankly,
now,
in
many
situations,
is
chaos.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
i
believe
that
congress
in
its
wisdom,
having
granted--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--i
think
to
the
extent
that
the
underlying
jurisdiction
was
available,
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
you
don't
have
to
have
a
diversity
case,
but
you
have
to
have
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
other
than
a
federal
question
of
a
basis
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
it
does
not
set
up
its
own
independent
jurisdiction--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
is
an
issue
that
is
to
be
determined
by
federal
substantive
law--
mr.
a.h.
gaede,
jr.
--but
if
it
happens
to
be
decided
in
the
state
court,
the
state
court
is
obligated
to
apply
that
federal
substantive
law.
and
as
mr.
floyd
said,
that
is
what
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
has
held
subsequent
to
this
case,
and
what
most
other
courts
have
held.
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
appealability,
this
is
not
a
piecemeal
appeal.
this
is
an
appeal
of
the
only
issue
that
exists.
and
the
gillespie
case,
we
think,
has
application
here.
i
understand
that
in
livesay,
this
court
said
that
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
courts
understand
that
gillespie
is
limited,
a
limited
decision,
but
we
think
that
if
gillespie
is
ever
going
to
have
any
application,
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
to
which
it
ought
to
apply,
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
where
the
circuit
courts
have
applied
gillespie
in
a
limited
way
to
take
appeal
of
stay
orders.
in
addition,
we
think
the
cohen
case
is
applicable
to
this
situation,
the
collateral
order
rule
in
the
cohen
case.
we
were
denied
the
right
to
a
hearing,
which
in
our
view
was
finally
denied
to
us.
that
is
an
important
question.
it
is
an
important
federal
question.
it
is
an
important
question
to
people
who
in
our
situation
are
trying
to
enforce
arbitration
agreements.
and
finally,
that
decision
was
unreviewable
on
appeal,
because
once
the
matter
went
to
the
state
court
and
was
determined
by
the
state
court,
there
is
nothing
for
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
the
circuit
court
and
if
the
state
court
finds
the
case...
decides
the
case
on
the
arbitration
question,
then
there
is
no
right
of
appeal
within
the
federal
system
to
us
to
a
circuit
court.
obviously,
it
is
possible
for
the
case
to
wind
its
way
up
through
the
state
court
system
and
then
take
a
discretionary
appeal
to
this
court,
but
that
is
a
very
difficult
and
very
torturous
route.
i
would
like
to
turn
for
one
minute,
if
i
could,
to
the
stay
question,
because
i
think
that
what
mr.
floyd
and
the
hospital
are
suggesting
here
turns
colorado
river
upside
down.
in
colorado
river,
this
court
held
that
unless
there
were
unusual
circumstances,
the
federal
court
could
not
defer
its
jurisdiction.
what
the
hospital
is
really
arguing,
we
think,
is
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
prior
filing
of
the
case
in
the
state
court
system
requires
that
the
case
be
referred
back
to
the
state
court
system.
if
you
look
at
the
facts
in
colorado
river,
you
had
the
mccarren
act
in
the
colorado
river,
which
indicated
that
these
water
right
cases
should
be
decided
in
the
state
courts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
even
a
question
before
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
federal
court
still
had
jurisdiction.
that
was
the
first
issue
this
court
decided.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
exactly
to
the
contrary.
this
section
4
is
a
right...
granted
a
right
to
my
client
to
have
a
hearing
in
federal
court.
the
second
thing
is
that
in
colorado
river
you
had
a
res,
the
water
rights.
there
is
no
res
in
this
situation.
there
is
no
similar
existing
body
of
property
to
be
dealt
with.
and
in
the
colorado
river,
there
was
a
very...
they
emphasized
there
were
a
thousand
defendants
in
the
state
court
case,
and
that
they
were
300
miles
apart,
all
of
these
factors.
that
is
not
true
in
this
case.
both
cases
are
in
the
courts
in
the
county
where
greensboro,
north
carolina,
resides.
the
only
factor
in
this
case
that
is
similar
to
colorado
river
or
that
colorado
river
relied
on
is
the
matter
of
priority
of
filing,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
the
simple
matter
of
priority
of
filing
should
be
determined.
on
the
issue
of
priority
of
filing,
i
would
like
to
point
out
again
that
we
as
a
party
trying
to
seek
to
enforce
our
section
4
rights
do
not
have
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
enforce
those
rights
until
the
other
party
has
declined
to
arbitrate.
the
only
solution
that
we
had
in
this
situation
absent
what
happened
is
to
ignore
the
fact
that
we
were
in
discussions
with
the
hospital
about
our
claims,
ignore
that,
file
our
arbitration
demand,
and
then
see
whether
or
not
they
would
resist
it
or
not.
thank
you,
your
honor.
