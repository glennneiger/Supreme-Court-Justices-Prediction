justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
a
hospital
contracted
with
the
respondent
building
contractor
for
the
building
of
additions
to
the
hospital.
and
that
contract
called
for
arbitration
of
disputes
arising
out
of
any
breach.
and
the
contractor
presented
several
arbitrable
cut
claims
to
the
hospital
or
increases
in
construction
costs
due
to
delay
or
inaction
by
the
hospital,
and
the
hospital
refused
to
pay
the
claims.
instead,
the
hospital
filed
an
action
in
north
carolina
state
court,
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
contractor
had
no
right
to
arbitration
and
also
seeking
an
injunction
forbidding
the
contractor
from
taking
any
steps
directed
toward
arbitration.
the
contractor
thereupon
brought
a
diversity
action.
and
the
united
states
district
court
for
north
carolina,
seeking
an
order
compelling
arbitration,
an
order
he
sought
under
section
4
of
the
united
states
arbitration
act
of
1925.
and
section
4
provides.
that
a
party
aggrieved
by
the
refusal
of
another
to
arbitrate
as
provided
by
an
agreement
between
them
may
petition
the
district
court,?
and
i
quote
from
the
statute,
?for
an
order
directing
that
such
arbitration
proceed
in
the
manner
provided
for
in
such
agreement.?
well,
instead
of
proceeding
with
the
suit,
the
district
court
stayed
the
federal
action,
pending
decision
of
the
hospital's
state
court
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
two
suits
involved
the
identical
issue
namely
the
arbitrability
any
of
the
contractor's
claims.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court's
stay
order
and
remanded
with
instructions
to
the
district
court
to
enter
an
order
to
arbitrate.
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
seven
years
ago,
in
a
case
called
colorado
river
conservation
district
versus
the
united
states,
we
held
that,
and
i
quote
from
that
opinion,
?the
pendency
of
an
action
in
the
state
court
is
no
bar
to
proceedings
concerning
the
same
matter
in
the
federal
court
having
jurisdiction
this
on
the
ground
that
federal
courts
have
a,
?virtually
unflagging
obligation
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
given
them.
we
recognized,
however,
that
exceptional
circumstances
might
permit
the
dismissal
of
federal
suit
due
to
the
presence
of
a
concurrent
state
proceeding
if
justified
by
reasons
of
wise
judicial
administration.
in
the
opinion
we
have
filed
today
examines
in
detail
the
reasons
argued
to
constitute
exceptional
circumstances
in
this
case,
and
we
have
concluded
that
such
exceptional
circumstances
have
not
been
established
and
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
rehnquist
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
