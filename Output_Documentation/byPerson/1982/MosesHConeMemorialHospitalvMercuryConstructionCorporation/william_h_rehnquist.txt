justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
really
is
preliminary
in
any
analytical
sense
to
the
arbitration
act
question,
isn't
it?
because
if
this
question
wasn't
properly
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it's
not
properly
here,
either.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
it
could
be
either
state
law
or
federal.
but
there
isn't
any
federal
law
of
contracts,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
federal
court
sitting
in
diversity
would
apply
north
carolina
law
to
a
contract
dispute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
floyd,
supposing
in
a
somewhat
different
situation
the
north
carolina
law
had
a
statute
of
frauds
for
arbitration
agreements
that
required
them
to
be
in
writing
and
signed
by
the
party
to
be
charged.
and
there
was
no
such
a
requirement,
of
course,
in
the
federal
aribtration
act.
now,
do
you
think
that
if
a
claim
is
made
to
arbitrate
in
north
carolina
under
a
north
carolina
contract
that
that
provision
of
state
law
is
enforceable
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
the
prima
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
whether
it's
compatible
with
the
federal
act
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
go
ahead.
you
run
your
own--
--why
are
you
hung
up
on
that?
do
you
think
prima
goes
that
far?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
help
your
case,
does
it?
why
do
you
concede
so
much
to
prima?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
develops
through
cases
and
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
the
one
before
it
right
now.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
appealability
issue,
then
would
the
respondent
still
be
entitled
to
seek
mandamus
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
they
originally
sought
as
an
alternate
to
the
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
got
appeal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
we
say
they
shouldn't
have
gotten
the
appeal,
would
they
be
free
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
seek
mandamus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
one
of
the
reasons
you
deny
mandamus
is
if
you
think
an
appeal
is
available.
mandamus
isn't
a
substitute
for
an
appeal.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
court
of
appeals
now
saw
that
no
appeal
was
available,
might
it
not
be
at
least
more
inclined
than
it
was
to
grant
mandamus?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it's
an
agreement.
maybe
that's--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
where
did
you
get
federal
substantive
law
of
contracts,
which
is
the
answer
you
just
gave.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
cases
from
this
court
support
that
in
this
particular
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
prima
didn't
address
that
question
as
to
what
law
would
govern
if
you
were
trying
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
dispute
between
the
parties
was
arbitrable.
that
was
conceded
it
was
arbitrable
in
prima
paint.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it
was
conceded
that
it
was
arbitrable,
prima
paint
didn't
have
to
decide
that
question.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
if
we
were
to
follow
that
we
would
have
to
tell
the
district
court
of
north
carolina
to
apply
substantive
state
law
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
particular
agreement
did
render
it
arbitrable.
and
if
that's
the
case,
wouldn't
it
be
much
simpler
to
do
just
what
the
district
judge
said;
instead
of
having
the
federal
court
look
over
to
state
law
and
try
to
find
what
conclusion
the
state
courts
would
reach,
let
the
companion
state
court
proceeding
produce
the
result
in
its
normal
course?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
district
court,
in
entering
that
order,
ruled
out
the
possibility
that
if
after
three
months
you
could
show
that
there
was
simply
no
progress
made
in
the
state
court
and
that
your
opponent
was
blocking
normal
process,
that
the
district
court
might
not
entertain
an
application
to
lift
the
stay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
theory
of
the
&
lybrand
v.
livesay,
was
the
same
sort
of
practical
analysis
as
yours,
wasn't
it;
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
case
is
over
when
they
refused
to
certify
the
class
because
all
the
plaintiff
has
at
stake
is
$30.00.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
state
court
doesn't
rule,
you
did
say
that
you
thought
the
judge
might
entertain
a
motion
to--
