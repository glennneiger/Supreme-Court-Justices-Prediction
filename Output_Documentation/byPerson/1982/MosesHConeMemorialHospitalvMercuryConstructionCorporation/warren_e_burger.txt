we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
cone
memorial
hospital
against
mercury
construction.
mr.
floyd,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
position
would
be
that
the
consequence
is
the
same
in
terms
of
enforcing
arbitration
or
not
enforcing
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
to
that
extent
there
is
a
federal
statutory
question
involved.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
want
to
save
any
time
for
rebuttal,
you'd
better
save
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gaede.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
question
here
is
not
embraced
in
the
proposition
that
there's
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
everyone
concedes
there's
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
the
question
is
to
arbitrate
what,
and
that
issue
arises
under
a
contract
which
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
is
it
not?
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
isn't
the
state
court
better
able
to
do
that
than
to
have
a
federal
court
do
it
under
a
diversity
route?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
what
the
district
court
did
decide,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
moses
cone
memorial
hospital
against
mercury
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
brennan.
