justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
put
in
the
word
"federal"
before
that
"issue".
is
it
a
federal
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
federal
issue
pending
before
the
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wouldn't
think
you
would
think
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
question
is
whether
under
the
contract
between
the
parties
arbitration
is
required,
in
this
case
is
it
a
matter
of
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what...
that's
the
jurisdictional
thing
for
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean...
the
federal
aribration
act
converts
a
contract
question
normally
controlled
by
state
law
into
a
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
hospital
sued
a
contractor
for
breach
of
contract.
what
law
would
govern
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
and
if
the
hospital
sued
the
contractor
in
state
court
to
enforce
an
arbitration
clause
and
the
question
was
whether
the
contract
required
arbitration
or
not,
it
would
be
state
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
said
the
only
thing
it
said...
my
question
was
if
they
sued
him
in
state
court
for
an
order
to
arbitrate,
that's
all,
to
enforce
the
contract,
it
would
be
a
state
law
question.
don't
answer
that
too
quickly.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
but
if
you
sue
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
then
whether
or
not
the
construction
of
the
contract
is
to
be
decided
by
federal
law
or
by
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should
have
trouble,
and
you
shouldn't
hurry.
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
courts
are
obliged
to
enforce
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
this
setting?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
question
involved
in
the
state
court
suit
that
was
removed,
did
that
have
any
federal
issue
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
going
to
be
controlled
wholly
by
state
law;
namely,
whether
the
dispute
was
arbitrable?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
on
that
one,
it
would
be
a
question
of
state
law.
and
if
it
was
decided
then
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
dispute
was
not
arbitrable,
that
would
be
the
end
of...
then
that
would
just
be
decided
by
litigation...
by
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
removal
to
the
federal
court
was
all
that
had
happened,
and
suppose
the
removal
was
justified.
suppose
the
removal
was
upheld.
whether
the
dispute
was
arbitrable
or
not
would
still
be
a
matter
of
state
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
it
would
still
be
a
question...
whether
the
dispute
was
arbitrable
would
be
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
the
federal
arbitration
act
get
into
it,
just
because
it's
removed
to
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
that
federal
courts
can
enforce
promises
to
arbitrate
under
the
arbitration
act,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
whether
they're
arbitrable
or
not
is
a
matter
of
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
whether
or
not
a
particular
dispute
is
arbitrable
under
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
but
it
would
be
governed
by
state
law
as
to
whether
or
not
the
dispute
was
arbitrable.
in
interpreting
the
contract;
namely,
did
the
parties
promise
to
arbitrate...
that's
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
the
hospital
had
been
engaged
in
a
dispute
with
another
contractor
under
the
very
same
words
of
another
contract
and
the
state
court
had
ruled
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
this
particular
kind
of
a
dispute
that
you're
talking
about
now
was
not
subject
to
the
arbitration
clause
in
the
contract.
now,
a
federal
court
is
deciding
the
issue.
wouldn't
the
federal
court
have
to
follow
the
state
court
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
if
the
state
court
has
already
said
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
language
like
this
in
the
contract
will
not
subject
to
arbitration
the
kind
of
a
dispute
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
wouldn't
the
federal
court
have
to
follow
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should
say
yes,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
opponent
says
that
the
same
issue
of
federal
law
was
involved
in
both
the
state
suit
and
the
federal
suit.
but
if
the
issue
is
arbitrability,
it
seems
to
me
that
i
don't
read
prima
paint
as
saying
that
the
question
of
arbitrability
is
a
matter
of
federal
law,
of
statutory
law.
it's
a
question
of
whatever
law
governs
the
contract.
and
if
arbitrability
is
really
the
major
issue
which
you
seem
to
think
it
is,...
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
arbitrability
is
the
central
issue,
and
if
that's
a
matter
of
state
law,
then
this
case
might
even
have
been
subject
to
a
motion
to
stay
under
pullman.
that
is,
if
this
case
is
subject
to
state
law,
and
we
ought
to
find
out
how
the
state
courts
construe
this
kind
of
a
local
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the...
well,
we
don't
need
to
argue.
justice
byron
r.
white
good
for
you.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
is
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
a
lot
of
contracts
have
arbitration
clauses
in
them,
but
not
every
dispute
that
is
brought
up
between
the
parties
is
covered
by
the
arbitration
clause.
that's
routine.
justice
byron
r.
white
but...
just
bear
with
me
a
minute.
suppose
that
there
is
a
contract
that
clearly
specifies
a
certain
category
of
issues
that
are
subject
to
arbitration,
and
some
other
issues
that
are
not
subject
to
arbitration.
now,...
and
the
people
get
into
an
argument
about
which
category
of
particular
disputes
falls
under.
is
that
a
matter
of
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
find
it,
but
the
question
is
what
law
governs
that
determination.
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
arising
in
federal
law.
you
can
have
a
diversity
action
seeking
specific
performance
on
a
contract,
and
the
applicable
law
is
going
to
be
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
is
it
a
body
of
federal
law
interpreting
contracts
that
otherwise
would
be
governed
by
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
if
the
contract
says
x
disputes
are
subject
to
arbitration
and
y
disputes
are
not,
but
then
there's
an
argument
about
whether
it's
x
or
y,
what
law
governs?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
they
would
be
governed
by--
--isn't
that
a
contract
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
under
the
state
law
of
contracts
matters
of
timeliness,
waiver
and
latches
are
matters
for
a
court
to
decide.
a
plaintiff
sues
to
compel
arbitration
and
the
defendant
says
well,
you've
waived
it
or
it's
untimely
or
the
demand
is
untimely
or
there've
been
latches
or
something.
and
the
state
court
says
well,
this
go
to
arbitrability
as
to
whether
this
particular
dispute
is
any
longer
arbitrable,
and
it's
a
matter
of
state
law.
would
that
be
a
matter
of
state
law
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
what
the
state
law...
how
it
would
come
out
in
a
suit
for
damages
in
a
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
law
must
decide
it
as
a
federal
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
court
refers
those
issues
to
the
arbitrator.
the
federal
rule
is
that
issues
such
as
that
shall
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
that
prevails
over
any
contrary
state
rule
where
there's
a
demand
for
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
that.
obviously,
that
has
to
be
present
or
the
federal
law
doesn't
apply
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
mean
to
bring
this
up
time
and
again,
but
suppose
there
is
a
real
honest
question
as
to
whether
under
the
language
in
a
contract
a
particular
dispute
is
arbitrable
or
not.
now,
let's
also
suppose
that
contrary
perhaps
to
what
you
would
say
that
that
issue
was
a
matter
of
state
law.
just
suppose
that.
and
then
there
is
a
pending
state
court
issue
on
the
same
state
law
question,
and
then
there
is
a
diversity
action
in
the
federal
court
seeking
to
invoke
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
the
judge
says,
well,
i
think
this
coverage
question,
this
arbitrability
question,
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
there
is
a
case
pending
in
state
court,
already
pending
there,
and
it
is
at
issue.
i
am
going
to
stay.
do
you
think
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
just
flatly
contrary
to
the
federal
arbitration
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
wanted
the
federal
courts
to
just
take
charge
of
arbitration
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
have
a
diversity
case
to
get
in
federal
court
under
the
arbitration
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
not
a
jurisdictional
statute.
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
suppose
all
the
parties
are...
well,
if
you
think
that...
if
the
coverage
question,
the
arbitrability
question
is
a
matter
of
federal
law,
why
wouldn't
any
action
to
enforce
a
contract,
promise
to
arbitrate
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
why
wouldn't
that
necessarily
be
arising
under
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
is--
