justice
john
paul
stevens
then,
mr.
floyd,
are
you
saying
that
in
this
case,...
under
section
4
of
the
federal
statute,
as
i
read
it,
there
are
only
two
issues;
one,
was
there
a
contract
containing
an
arbitration
clause,
and
i
guess
that's
not
in
dispute,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
second
issue
is
did
one
of
the
parties
refuse
to
arbitrate,
and
i
guess
that's
not
in
dispute;
you
did
refuse
to
arbitrate.
that's
your
position
in
the
state
court,
that
you
don't
have
to
arbitrate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
refused.
and
aren't
those
the
only
two
issues
the
federal
judge
has
to
rule
on,
and
doesn't
he,
then,
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
have
a
duty
to
order
arbitration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
do
you
need
a
hearing
if
there
are
no
disputed
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
said
you
admitted
that,
and
i
think
your
pleadings
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
neither
of
those
issues
is
disputed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
you
don't
deny
it
contains
an
arbitration
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
the
first
condition
of
the
statute
is
satisfied.
and
you
also
don't
deny
that
you
refused
to
arbitrate.
well,
not
if
the
particular
dispute
isn't
covered
by
the
arbitration
clause,
which
is
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
those...
aren't
those
questions
that
the
arbitrator
will
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
another
question
if
i
may,
mr.
floyd.
may
i
go
back
to
the
question
that
i
was
asking
you
before
about
the
issues
raised
by
your
opponent's
petition
in
the
federal
court
for
an
order
directing
arbitration.
your
response
to
that
petition
alleged
that
mercury
was
in
default
in
proceeding
with
arbitration
and
in
complying
with
the
express
conditions
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
i'm
reading
from
your
response.
you
do
not
respond,
as
i
read
your
response,
by
saying
that
the
dispute
in
question
is
not
covered
by
the
arbitration
clause.
rather,
you
say
they
were
in
default
in
meeting
some
of
the
conditions
to
arbitration.
and
would
not
that
kind
of
issue
be
appropriately
submitted
to
the
arbitrator?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to
draw?
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
a
condition
precedent
other
than
timeliness
that
they
failed
to
comply
with.
one
is
you
say
they're
in
default,
i
gather
you
say
because
they
didn't
act
with
sufficient
promptness.
is
there
some
other
condition
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
that's
back
to
timeliness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
and
you're
saying
that
one
of
the
conditions
is
before
they
can
request
arbitration
they
must
submit
the
dispute
to
the
architect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there's
a
factual
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
they
did
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
saying
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you're
saying
that's
an
issue
that
the
judge
must
decide,
not
the
arbitrator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
contract
in
the
papers
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
portion
of
the
contract
that
describes
this
condition
you've
just
discussed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
you
tell
me
where?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
only
part
of
it
i
think,
because
one
branch
of
his
argument
is
that
it's
not
ripe
for
arbitration
until
it's
been
submitted
to
the
architect
and
passed
on
by
the
architect.
and
it's
only
after
that
that
you
can
submit
it
for
arbitration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
affidavit
before
the
federal
judge
at
the
time
you
presented
your
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and
they
did
not
controvert
that
affidavit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
tell
me,
where
is
that
in
the
record?
is
that
in
the
printed
papers
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
that
an
issue
that's
normally
decided
by
the
court
or
by
the
arbitrator--
