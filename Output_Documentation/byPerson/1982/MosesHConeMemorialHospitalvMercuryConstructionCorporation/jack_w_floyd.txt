mr.
jack
w.
floyd
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
currently
under
consideration
presents
the
question
of
the
exercise
of
the
district
court's
discretion
in
staying
matters
pending
on
its
docket
in
view
of
a
filed
state
court
action
between
the
same
parties
involving
the
same
issue
in
both
courts.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
it
is
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
it
is
not
a
federal
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
the
issue
is
arbitration
provided
by
both
the
federal
act
and
the
state
act.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
it
is
to
be
decided
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
your
honor,
that
is
both
federal
and
state
law.
the
federal
arbitration
act--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--it
is
not
a
federal
question
in
terms
of
federal--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--the
state
law
of
north
carolina.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
unless
the
federal
arbitration
act
applies.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
think
my
answer
is
yes,
it
would
be
a
state
law
question,
and
the
federal
arbitration
act
is
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
have
trouble
answering
the
question.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
in
that
the
construction--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
there
is
a
federal
statutory
question
involved.
the
federal
statute
involved
is
the
federal
arbitration
act
which
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
has
held
is
a
part
of
the
law
of
north
carolina
under
the
supremacy
clause
and
must
be
enforced
as
any
other
part
of
the
law
of
north
carolina
would
be
enforced.
so
the
dichotomy
between
federal
and
state
law
is
confusing
in
the
circumstances.
higher
courts
have
always
held
that
the
federal...
the
supremacy
clause
requires
enforcement.
the
question
under
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
case
was
not
that
at
all;
it
was
an
interpretation
of
the
commerce
clause,
which
was
too
narrow
and
overruled
ultimately
in
the
schafer
partnership
case
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
the
next
question
involved,
and
just
as
important
as
that
one,
in
my
view,
is
how
and
when
the
federal
appeals
courts
may
review
the
exercise
of
the
district
judge's
discretion.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
it
is
jurisdictional
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
court,
absent
jurisdiction,
could
not
proceed.
so
analytically
i
think
that
is
the
first
question
that
we
should
discuss.
the
facts
giving
rise
to
these
questions
are
that
on
october
8th,
1980,
the
hospital
filed
suit
in
the
north
carolina
superior
court
of
guilford
county
in
greensboro
against
two
defendants.
first
was
mercury
construction
corporation,
an
alabama
corporation;
and
second
was
j.n.
pease
&
associates,
a
north
carolina
corporation.
the
complaint
filed
in
the
superior
court
in
north
carolina
alleged
that
some
months
earlier,
mercury
had
delivered
to
pease,
the
architect,
a
document
entitled
claim
for
equitable
adjustment
of
contract
price;
that
this
asserted
a
claim
for
some
$2
million
against
the
hospital.
the
hospital
had
spent
some
months
investigating
that
claim,
had
concluded
it
had
no
validity,
had
concluded
that
the
basis
for
the
claim
was
alleged
delays
which
were
the
fault
of
the
hospital
during
a
period
of
construction
of
about
five
years
on
a
renovation
and
new
construction
project
at
the
hospital.
the
complaint
in
the
district
court
alleged
that
there
was
no
fault
in
the
hospital
concerning
delays
of
an
ongoing
hospital
operation,
renovation
and
construction
project;
that
if
there
were
delays
beyond
that
which
was
contemplated
by
the
parties
in
the
beginning,
they
were
the
fault
either
of
mercury
or
of
the
architect.
and
alleged
various
instances
in
which
the
architect
was
at
fault
in
failing
to
adjudicate,
in
failing
to
pass
on
decisions
of
both
parties.
the
complaint
prayed
that
if
it
was
found
that
the
hospital
was
liable
in
any
respect,
that
it
sought
judgment
over
against
the
architect.
mercury,
some
three
weeks
later,
filed...
or
removed
the
action
under
the
removal
statute
to
the
federal
court.
and
curiously,
at
the
same
time
filed
a
section
4
petition
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
it
had
no
federal
issue
in
it,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
no,
sir.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
the
question
in
the
state
court
suit
was...
one
of
the
questions
was
whether
the
dispute
was
arbitrable;
you're
right.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
under
state
law
or
any
other
law
if
the
decision
is
that
the
dispute
is
not
arbitrable,
it
proceeds
to
litigation.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
a
matter
of
state
law
when
you
define
it
as
i've
already
defined
it
for
your
honor.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
state
law,
including
the
federal
arbitration
act.
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
if
the
arbitration
question
arises
in
a
contract
which
is
subject
to
the
federal
arbitration
act;
to-wit:
one
in
commerce,
in
this
context--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--they
cannot
enforce
such
contracts
absent
diversity
and
amount
in
controversy
requirements
of
the
diversity
statute.
the
federal
scheme
for
enforcement
of
arbitration,
under
the
federal
act,
contemplates
in
its
genesis
that
it
will
be
enforced
by
state
courts
simply
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
given
to
the
federal
courts
except
in
diversity
cases,
if
you've
got
a
commerce
clause
kind
of
contract
as
opposed
to
a
maritime
kind
of
contract.
so
the
scheme
in
the
beginning
is
that
who
shall
enforce
arbitration;
it
must
be
both
federal
and
state
courts
because
the
federal
courts
are
not
given
jurisdiction
or
an
independent
basis
of
jurisdiction.
therefore,
several
of
the
circuits
have
held
there
is
no
federal
question
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
if
you
analyze
it
as
what
relief
is
available,
assuming
you
are
under
the
federal
arbitration
act,
the
relief
available
is
either
state
or
federal,--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--and
it
makes
no
difference
which
court
decides
the
question.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
no
federal
law
of
contracts.
there's
a
federal
law
of
arbitration.
the
law
of
contracts...
and
this
contract,
incidentally,
specifies
the
garden
variety
sort
of
thing;
that
is,
that
the
law
of
north
carolina
shall
apply
to
its
terms
and
to
its
interpretation.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
absolutely.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
a
federal
court
or
a
state
court
would
apply
general
contract
law
to
that
provision.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
your
honor,
that's
the
same
kind
of
question
that
justice
fortis
wrestled
with
in
the
prima
paint
case.
you
recall
that
in
that
case
we
had
a
similar
provision,
and
his
holding
in
prima
paint
is
that
you
do
not
apply
the
state
law
to
the
question
of
coverage
under
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
you
do
apply
the
arbitration
law
to
that
question.
and
it
matters
not
in
this
case
whether
you
apply
the
uniform
arbitration
act
in
effect
in
north
carolina
or
whether
you
apply
the
federal
act.
whether
you
call
it
federal
law
or
state
law
has
no
substantive
result.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
assume
your
honor
is
asking
about
a
contract
otherwise
in
commerce.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
and
therefore,
the
provisions
of
the
act
are
invoked.
any
provision
of
state
law
not
compatible
with
the
federal
act
is
not
enforceable
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
well,
if
the
federal
act
says
go
arbitrate
and
the
state
law
says
you
don't
have
to
for
whatever
reason
in
this
case,
then
my
answer
is
you
go
arbitrate
because
the
federal
law
is
supreme.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
contract.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
we
are
not
in
arbitration,
obviously--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--the
answer
is
yes,
once
he
has
conducted
the
hearing
that
the
act
requires.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
the
disputed
issues
are
the
making
of
the
agreement.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
the
agreement,
your
honor,--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--the
agreement
is
a
book
that
long.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
do
not
deny
it
contains
an
arbitration
clause--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--that's
correct.
to
say
i
agree
to
arbitrate
does
not
mean
that
i
agree
to
arbitrate
every
conceivable
dispute.
for
instance:
the
federal
cases
are
clear
that
if
we
deal
with
an
antitrust
case,
regardless
of
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
you
don't
arbitrate
it.
a
patent
case
you
don't
arbitrate
it,
even
though
it
may
be
subject
to
the
act.
further,
the
pima
paint
case
says
you
look
to
the
agreement
to
determine
what
the
parties
agreed
to
arbitrate.
our
contention
here
is
we
never
agreed
to
arbitrate
a
dispute
arising
after
the
construction
project
of
five
years.
if
you
look
at
the
contract
clause
to
arbitrate;
that
is,
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
clause,
you
will
find
that
it
is
not
an
unconditional
agreement
to
arbitrate;
it
is
cross-referenced.
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
leaves
out
the
cross
reference.
it
is
cross-referenced
to
article
ii,
which
says
arbitration
can
be
had
only
when...
article
ii
deals
with
resolution
of
disputes
during
the
ongoing
of
construction.
it
says
that
you
cannot
arbitrate,
we
do
not
agree
to
arbitrate
unless
during
construction.
it
is
referred
to
the
architect
for
decision.
then
within
a
reasonable
time,--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--no,
your
honor.
an
agreement
that
says
i
will
arbitrate
on
wednesday;
if
you
seek
to
arbitrate
on
thursday,
have
you
agreed
to
arbitrate?
answer:
no.
you
have
entered
a
conditional
agreement
to
arbitrate,
and
you
don't
go
to
an
architect
to
find
out
whether
the
conditions
preceding
are
met.
by
the
time
you're
doing
that,
you're
already
in
arbitration.
so
my
answer
to
that...
and
i'd
like
to
pause
for
a
moment
and
state
that
we
have
never
been
able
to
have
the
district
court
judge
make
this
kind
of
inquiry.
he
has
never
reached
it.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
don't
think
a
federal
court--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--i
don't
think
a
federal
court
would
apply
state
law.
that's
where
my
hang-up
is.
you
see,--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--i
think
prima
requires
that
the
court,
regardless
of
state
or
federal,--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--because
i'm
afraid
that
that's
the
way
the
law's
developed.
i'm
afraid
that
it
doesn't
matter
which
court
decides.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
if
a
state
court
has
decided
on
the
arbitrability
question
that
it
is
not
arbitrable,
that
that
will
be
a
final
determination
for
all
purposes.
and
a
party
can
obtain
review
of
that
through
the
state
court
appeals
process.
i
don't
think
we
have
a
situation
where
we
ought
to
have
multiple
federal
courts
and
multiple
state
courts
racing
to
judgment
on
the
same
question.
that
just
does
not
comport
with
common
sense.
i
think
once
a
party
has
had
determined
his
right...
and
in
this
instance,
there
is
no
question
but
what
mercury
has
a
right
to
have
the
question
of
arbitration
decided
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mercury
has
no
right
to
select
its
court.
it
was
the
defendant
in
this
case.
mercury
has
filed
a
duplicative
litigation
in
this
case
in
federal
court.
the
parties
have
always
been
able
to
go
to
the
court
in
which
this
action
was
instituted
and
obtain
a
speedy
adjudication
of
that
very
right.
the
question
presented,
therefore,
is
not
whether
mercury
has
been
deprived
of
its
right
of
prompt
decision.
what
mercury
is
complaining
about
is
it's
been
deprived
of
the
right
to
choose
the
forum,
and
that's
the
only
difference.
it
has
no
right
to
choose
the
forum.
wise
administration
of
justice
compels
the
conclusion
that
you
don't
keep
racing
to
judgment
whenever
you
have
multiple
litigations.
so
the
question
is
which
court
should
wait
on
the
other.
in
the
circumstances
here,
it
makes
sense
that
the
federal
court
should
wait
on
the
state.
all
the
traditional
considerations
are
present.
if
i
may
now
address
the
question
of
appealability.
the
central
point
here
is
that
the
stay
order
is
not
a
final
order.
the
cases
in
this
court
are
so
recent
that
i
don't
think
they
require
extensive
discussion.
in
this
case,
the
judge
was
free,
and
i
think
designedly
so...
he
did
not
dismiss
the
case...
he
was
free,
if
mercury
comes
back
in
and
says
i
can't
get
a
decision...
in
other
words,
my
prompt
hearing
is
being
denied
me
in
the
state
court...
the
judge
could
clearly
have
lifted
his
stay
order
and
proceeded
to
the
merits.
but
we
didn't
have
time
to
determine
that
the
way
this
case
went.
there's
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
free
to
do
so.
if
mercury
was
being
denied
its
right
to
a
prompt
hearing
before
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction,
he
probably
would
have
lifted
his
stay
order.
there
can
be
no
doubt,
therefore,
that
this
is
not
a
final
order.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
applied
its
practical
finality
analysis.
i
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
the
&
lybrand
is
not
materially
distinguishable
from
the
practical
finality
rule
applied
here.
the
point
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
courts
of
appeals
to
fashion
on
a
case-by-case
basis
their
own
jurisdiction.
when
congress
enacted
section
1291
that
appeal
shall
lie
only
from
final
decisions,
that
does
not
include
stay
orders.
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
analyze
its
jurisdiction
on
a
case-by-case
basis;
that
is
a
mini-trial
all
over
again,
just
as
the
death
knell
economic
inquiry
was
a
mini-trial
all
over
again.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
your
honor,
i
think
the
alternate
was
the
appeal
to
mandamus.
they
sought
mandamus,
or
in
the
alternative,
gave
notice
of
appeal.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
they
got
appeal.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
denied
mandamus
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals'
heading
is
in
re
mercury,
which
is
the
mandamus
case,
in
mercury
against
cone.
i
think
the
implication
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
that
we
have
denied
mandamus.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
that
is
the
court's--
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
--it
might
be,
your
honor.
it
might
be.
i
submit
that
there's
no
ground
for
mandamus
either,
however.
and
as
this
court
said
in
allied
chemical
back
in
1980,
mandamus
in
discretionary
orders...
what,
never?
well,
hardly
ever.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
should,
by
mandamus,
interfere
with
the
trial
court's
running
of
its
docket.
so
while
yes,
conceivably
the
proper
result
would
be
to
send
it
back
and
let
the
court
of
appeals
reconsider,
in
view
of
its
ambiguous
ruling
on
mandamus,
i
submit
that
should
not
and
need
not
be
done
in
this
case.
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
rejects
mandamus
when
it
finds
the
matter
appealable.
to
reconsider
in
light
of
this
court's
rulings
on
mandamus
in
discretionary
order
cases,
would
be
a
waste
of
the
parties'
and
the
court's
time.
i
submit
that
the
proper
result
in
this
court
is
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
direct
the
case
be
remanded
subject
to
the
stay
order;
that
is,
affirm
judge
ward's
stay
order.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
w.

i
do.
if
my
allegation
is
read
to
be
solely
mercury
did
not
move
fast
enough
to
cause
arbitration
to
take
place,
then
i
am
alleging
one
of
the
time
delay
kinds
of
defenses
to
arbitration.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
that
the
federal
courts
have
largely
overruled.
that
is,
that
sort
of
dispute
is
for
the
arbitrator.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
that
is
not
what
is
intended
by
the
language
that
you
read.
when
i
say
mercury
has
failed
to
comply
with
the
conditions,
the
condition
i'm
talking
about
is
the
contingent
nature
of
the
agreement
to
arbitrate.
and
the
point
is
you
can't
decide
that
without
getting
into
a
question
of
what
was
the
intent
of
the
parties.
if
you
say
i'll
arbitrate
but
not
if,
or
not
unless
a
condition
is
complied
with,
that
is
not
the
agreement
to
arbitrate
that
must
in
all
instances
be
submitted
to
arbitrate.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
because
they
did
not
submit
the
dispute
to
the
arbitrator
during
the
course
of
construction.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
no,
sir.
submit
the
dispute
to
the
architect,
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke.
there
are
two
material
provisions
which
are
conditions
precedent
to
cones'
agreement
to
arbitrate.
one
is
article
2
of
our
contract
deals
with
how
you
conduct
yourself
during
construction.
and
that's
very
important
to
the
owner.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
during
the
process
of
construction.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
well,
there's
no
factual
dispute.
they
did
not.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
it's
a
condition
precedent
issue.
that
is,
i
agree
to
arbitrate
but
only
if.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
the
entire
contract
is
not.
as
i
say,
it's
a
large
book.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
ja28
begins
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
and
i
might
emphasize
that
that
is
not,
by
any
means,
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
feel
like
i
shouldn't
sit
down
without
mentioning
this
court's
decision
in
colorado
river
and
in
the
will
case.
this
case,
on
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
stay,
is
stronger
than
either
of
those
cases.
that
is,
in
this
case,
the
circumstances
compelled
stay
much
more
clearly
than
in
either
of
those
cases.
in
will
you
had
a
question
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
simply
not
present
here.
nevertheless,
the
stay
was
upheld.
in
colorado
river
you
had
federal
interest
more
deeply
involved
than
we
have
here,
and
this
court
sanctioned
and
affirmed
a
dismissal,
not
a
stay.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
it's
the
only
issue
in
the
section
4
of
the
petition.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
would
certainly
agree
with
that.
i
do
not
read
justice
fortis's
opinion
the
same
way
the
court
does,
but
hopefully,
you
read
it
better
than
i
do.
that
is
certainly
the
result
i
want.
mr.
jack
w.
floyd
i
do
not
care
for
rebuttal.
i've
said
what
i
have
to
say.
thank
you.
