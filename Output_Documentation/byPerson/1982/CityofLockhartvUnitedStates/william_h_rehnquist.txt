justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mizell,
was
his
testimony...
is
that
orally
or
in
affidavit
form?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
in
the
statute
itself
or
just
in
the
history?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
any
change
made
in
section
5?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
garza,
does
your
opponent
agree
with
you
on
that
issue
of
texas
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
congress
really
intended,
in
referring
these
matters
involving
states
far
away
from
the
district
of
columbia
to
have
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
whose
judges
presumably
have
no
expertise
in
the
law
of
texas,
to
pass
on
questions
of
state
law
as
well
as
questions
of
federal
arising
under
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
the
district
of
columbia
court,
inexperienced
as
i
presume
they
might
admit
they
were
on
texas
law,
simply
apply
the
usual
presumption
that
goes
with
official
acts;
that
they're
presumed
valid
unless
shown
to
be
otherwise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
could
have
done
it
somewhat
differently.
we
had
a
case
here
last
year,
i
believe,
from
mississippi
involving
a
challenge
to
a
system
in
a
mississippi
city
or
county,
where
first
the
people
obtained
a
decision
from
the
state
court
saying
that
it
was
invalid
under
state
law,
and
then
they
were
still,
of
course,
required
to
get
a
pre-clearance
from
the
justice
department
because
they
were
going
to
put
in
a
new
system.
but
at
least
i
think
they
saw
the
wisdom
of
litigating
state
issues
in
the
state
courts,
and
then
litigating
the
voting
rights
issues.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
garza,
is
that
really
a
very
satisfactory
way
of
interpreting
legislation?
you
have
a
section
5
which
has,
in
the
past,
been
addressed
to
the
kind
of
situations
involved
in
this
case.
section
2,
which
has
traditionally
been
addressed
to
the
bolden
case.
section
2
has
amended...
the
primary
purpose
apparently
being
to
change
the
result
in
bolden.
section
5
is
left
absolutely
alone,
and
to
say
that
a
footnote
in
the
legislative
history
means
that
section
5
was
intended
to
be
changed
while
section
2,
when
the
language
of
section
5
wasn't
changed,
strikes
me
as
something
that
probably
escaped
an
awful
lot
of
the
members
of
congress
who
thought
they
were
voting
on
the
bill.
