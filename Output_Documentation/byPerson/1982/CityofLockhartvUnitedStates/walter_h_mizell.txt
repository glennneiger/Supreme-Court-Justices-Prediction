mr.
walter
h.
mizell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
proper
application
of
the
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
it
arises
out
of
the
circumstances
which
have
developed
in
the
city
of
lockhart,
texas.
lockhart's
a
town
of
about
7,500
people
located
in
central
texas.
for
some
50-odd
years
prior
to
1973,
it
was
governed
as
a
general
law
city
in
texas
by
a
commission
form
of
government.
it
had
a
mayor,
it
had
two
commissioners
who
were
elected
at
large
by
numbered
places,
who
were
elected
for
two-year
terms
every
even-numbered
year.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
plurality.
in
1972,
the
city
began
to
explore
the
adoption
of
a
home
rule
charter,
and
a
charter
commission
was
formed
to
begin
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
a
charter
would
be
desirable
for
the
city
of
lockhart.
they
determined
that
it
was
and
began,
as
charter
commissioners
elected
subsequently,
to
draft
a
home
rule
charter
for
the
city.
the
charter
commission
was
made
up
of
15
people,
nine
of
whom
were
anglos,
six
of
whom
were
minority
citizens;
of
those
six,
four
were
mexican
americans
and
two
were
negro.
the
commission
worked
for
several
months
in
drafting
the
charter.
they
ultimately
adopted
unanimously
a
version
of
the
charter
which
was
submitted
to
the
city
commissioners.
the
commissioners
took
that
charter
as
proposed
and
without
any
change
submitted
it
to
the
voters
of
lockhart.
in
february
of
1973,
the
charter
was
approved
and
went
into
effect.
the
impact
that
had
on
the
voting
system
in
lockhart
was
to
enlarge
the
city's
governing
body
from
three
to
five.
now
there
were
a
mayor
and
four
councilmen,
they
were
called.
the
two
additional
councilmen
were
elected
by
plurality
in
an
off-year
election.
that
is,
they
were
elected
in
odd-numbered
years
for
places
numbered
three
and
four.
following
the
73
adoption
of
the
charter,
elections
were
held
in
april
of
73
for
the
two
new
places
that
were
created,
and
elections
were
held
thereafter
until
1978.
in
1975,
the
voting
rights
act
was
made
applicable
to
the
state
of
texas
and
picked
up
retroactively
any
changes
that
would
have
taken
place
in
the
voting
system
after
november
of
1972.
this
retroactively
picked
up
the
adoption
of
the
charter
and
the
changes
in
the
voting
system
thereby.
but
for
reasons
that
are
not
clear
in
the
record,
the
charter
changes
were
never
submitted
to
the
justice
department
as
required
by
the
voting
rights
act.
elections
continued
until
1978;
were
scheduled
for
1979
when
the
mexican
american
plaintiffs
in
this
case
filed
an
action
for
injunctive
relief
seeking
to
block
elections
in
lockhart
under
the
charter
until
the
charter
received
pre-clearance.
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
injunction
issued
by
the
judge
in
austin,
texas,
the
local
district
judge,
was
written
in
such
a
way
that
it
did
not
allow
elections
using
numbered
places,
whether
they
were
under
the
old
system
or
under
the
new
system.
and
so
there
have
been
no
elections
in
lockhart
until
this
day
because
the
city
was
foreclosed...
at
least
it
felt
that
it
was...
by
the
wording
of
the
order
from
going
back
to
the
prior
system.
although
it
would
have
been
willing
to
initially.
the
city's
position
in
austin
in
the
district
court
there
and
has
been
all
along
was
that
the
changes
adopted
in
1973
by
the
charter
were
probably
advantageous
for
minority
voting
rights
in
lockhart,
or
at
least
neutral,
but
certainly
not
negative
in
their
impact.
in
1982,
this
year,
as
set
forth
in
the
supplemental
brief
we
filed
a
week
or
so
ago,
judge
hepalito
garci,
the
judge
in
san
antonio
who
now
has
charge
of
the
1979
proceedings,
in
response
to
a
motion
for
interim
elections
which
was
filed
by
the
intervenor
in
this
case,
reviewed
the
order
that
had
been
entered
in
1979
and
revised
that
order.
and
the
language
that
he
revised
had
to
do
with
the
procedure
by
which
elections
could
be
conducted
pending
pre-clearance.
the
language
of
his
order
clarifies
and
allows
the
city
to
return
to
the
prior
system
of
electing
a
mayor
and
two
commissioners
every
other
year
until
such
time
as
pre-clearance
is
either
granted,
or
if
it's
denied
i
presume
that
we
would
stay
with
the
old
system.
the
impact
of
that
order
is
that
it
substantially
undercuts
both
the
position
of
the
intervenor
in
this
case
with
regard
to
what
the
standard
for
measurement
should
be
under
the
voting
rights
act,
and
it
also
undermines
the
position
of
the
lower
court
below
which
framed
its
opinion
in
terms
of
an
assumption
or
conclusion
that
the
judge
in
austin,
texas
had
concluded
that
the
prior
system,
using
numbered
places
for
election
of
the
two
places
that
were
existing
at
that
time,
that
those
numbered
places
were
invalid
under
texas
law.
so
we
have
the
district
court
in
washington
relying
in
part
upon
what
it
believed
to
be
the
finding
by
the
district
judge
in
austin,
texas.
that
ruling
has
now
been
reversed
upon
reconsideration
by
the
judge,
and
we
are
now
free
for
the
first
time
since
this
litigation
began,
free
to
return
to
the
system
which
was
in
effect,
in
practice,
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
charter.
this
means
that
for
purposes
of
comparison,
it's
the
city
of
lockhart's
position
that
the
appropriate
standard
was,
and
at
all
times
has
been,
the
actual
system
that
was
in
operation
in
lockhart
and
had
been
since
1917
or
thereabouts,
using
the
numbered
places.
now
with
that
in
mind,
the
question
becomes
what
kind
of
standard
of
comparison
did
the
court
below
used.
it's
our
contention
that
the
court
below
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
making
the
comparison
to
the
wrong
standard.
the
allegation
was
made
that
numbered
places
in
a
general
law
city,
in
lockhart,
texas,
were
in
contravention
of
state
law,
and
therefore,
were
deemed
by
the
district
court
below
to
be
invalid.
they
made
the
comparison
and
the
expert
testimony
educed
on
behalf
of
the
intervenor
and
on
behalf
of
the
justice
department
below
were
based
upon
the
assumption
that
the
system
that
had
been
in
operation
was
illegal
under
texas
law.
the
city
first
takes
the
position
that
that's
not
supportable
under
texas
law,
and
we
argued
that
vigorously
in
the
district
court
below,
but
we
haven't
briefed
that
for
this
court
because
we
really
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference.
the
law
that
this
court
has
followed
at
least
since
perkins
versus
matthews
of
1971
is
that
you
don't
look
at
some
theoretical
system
that
should
be
used
or
might
be
used
or
could
be
used;
you
focus
on
the
system
that
was
actually
in
effect,
and
measure
the
changes
against
that
system.
the
system
actually
in
effect
is
undisputed
in
this
case;
and
that
is,
numbered
places
for
election
of
the
two
city
commissioners
prior
to
adoption
of
the
charter.
therefore,
in
trying
to
identify
the
precise
nature
of
the
changes
which
were
rightly
reviewable
by
the
court
below,
the
city
urges
that
there
were
really
only
two
changes.
the
first
change
was
the
enlargement
of
the
city's
governing
body
from
three
to
five;
that's
mayor
plus
two
commissioners
to
now
mayor
plus
four
city
councilmen.
we
take
the
position
and
strongly
urge
it,
that
putting
numbered
places
for
the
two
new
councilmen
whose
positions
were
just
created
there,
was
not
a
change
because
lockhart
had
been
using
numbered
places
for
over
half
a
century.
so
what
we
really
did
was
we
just
made
the
council
bigger
and
continued
that
system
in
operation.
the
court
below
was
divided,
and
chief
judge
spottswood
robinson
took
a
slightly
different
tact
in
his
dissent
with
regard
to
those
numbered
places
for
the
two
new
seats.
he
took
the
position
that
although
the
two
new
seats
were
unobjectionable,
that
putting
numbered
places
on
those
did
constitute
a
change.
and
then
he
went
on
to
make
the
comparison
in
the
before
and
after
test
and
determined
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
that
there
was
no
negative
impact
whether
you
considered
the
imposition
of
numbered
places
to
the
two
new
seats.
he
decided
that
that
did
not
constitute
a
negative
impact
change.
and
under
beer
versus
united
states
which
this
court
decided
in
1976,
without
retrogressive
effect
the
addition
of
the
numbered
places
to
the
two
new
seats,
he
concluded,
did
not
have
a
negative
impact.
the
city's
position,
as
i
say,
is
slightly
different.
we
simply
think
that
enlarging
the
council's
governing
body,
or
the
city's
governing
body,
by
two
places
meant
that
the
numbered
place
system
was
carried
forward,
and
the
only
thing
to
be
really
measured
was
whether
or
not
enlarging
the
size
of
the
city's
governing
body
had
positive,
negative
or
neutral
impact.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
the
enlargement
of
the
council,
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
we
believe
that
the
enlargement
was
a
section
5
change,
and
needed
to
be
considered,
reviewed
by
the
justice
department
and
pre-cleared.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
yes,
sir,
justice
white,
it
always
has
been.
we
initially
filed
some
pleadings
in
the
district
court
in
austin
which--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--said
it
was
not
subject
to
preclearance.
those
were
rather
hastily
drafted
in
response
to
a--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--we
certainly
do.
and
the
second
change,
which
was
brought
about
by
the
charter,
was
the
staggered
term
aspect
of
it.
and
again,
chief
judge
robinson
below
in
his
dissent
recognized
that
you
have
to...
if
you
just
take
a
four
or
five-member
governing
body
that's
being
elected
all
at
once
every
other
year
and
carve
it
up
into
three
one
year
and
two
the
next,
that's
one
situation.
but
our
position
is...
and
chief
judge
robinson
below
noted
this...
it
depends
on
how
they
get
there
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
any
discriminatory
impact.
if
you're
creating
two
new
ones
and
happen
to
decide
to
elect
them
in
an
odd-numbered
year
or
off-year
election,
then
there's
no
way
that
you
can
determine
any
discriminatory
impact
because
now
you
have
a
totally
new
election
for
two
new
seats
that
never
existed
before.
if
you
move
from
five
elected
all
at
once
to
two
one
year
and
three
the
next,
that
could
certainly
have
discriminatory
impact,
and
we
don't
have
any
argument
with
that
proposition
of
law.
what
we
do
argue
is
that
under
the
circumstances
by
which
these
two
new
seats
were
created,
there
was
no
negative
impact.
and
chief
judge
robinson
in
the
court
below
agreed
with
that.
so
we
think
that
first,
the
court
below
used
an
erroneous
standard
with
respect
to
the
numbered
places.
that
is,
that
they
compared
it
against
some
fictitious
scheme
that
never
had
existed
before,
never
will
exist
so
far
as
judge
hepalito
garcia's
order
is
concerned
because
if
this
court
were
to
rule
against
us
and
we
return
to
the
prior
system,
we
do
it
as
a
home
rule
city
and
now,
under
the
old
election
system.
which
brings
me
to
another
point.
the
third
question
that
was
raised
in
our
brief
before
this
court
dealt
with
the
actual
status
of
the
city
of
lockhart
as
a
home
rule
city.
there
is
some
language
in
the
opinion
by
the
majority
below
which
casts
some
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
they
intended
to
reduce
lockhart
to
its
general
law
status.
the
status
that
it
had
under
texas
law,
prior
to
adoption
of
the
charter.
it's
not
entirely
clear,
and
i
certainly
want
to
be
open
with
the
court
on
that
point,
that
the
decision
below
is
a
little
bit
vague
as
to
what
they
intended
on
that,
but
we
wanted
to
be
cautious,
so
we
brought
the
matter
to
this
court
as
the
third
point
in
our
brief.
in
response
to
that
point,
the
justice
department
has
taken
the
position
in
its
brief
that
we
have
over-reacted
and
that
the
language
there
that
casts
doubt
upon
the
home
rule
status
is
simply
not
worthy
of
that
conclusion.
and
it
is
my
understanding
from
reading
the
intervenor's
brief
that
they
also
take
the
position.
so
what
you
have
now,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
justice
department
is
not
taking
the
position
that
we
were
reduced
to
general
law
status;
the
intervenor
is
not
taking
that
position
and
certainly,
the
city
would
not
want
to
take
that
position.
so
i
think
the
court
could
safely
conclude
then
that
all
the
parties
before
the
court
are
now
taking
a
position
that
we
are
and
will
continue
to
be
a
home
rule
city,
operating
as
a
home
rule
city
with
all
the
powers
that
are
granted
to
a
home
rule
city
under
texas
law.
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
we
think
are
based
upon
an
incorrect
standard
for
comparison.
the
facts
below,
to
the
extent
that
they
rest
upon
fact
findings,
may
be
seen
to
be
clearly
erroneous
under
rule
52
and
the
standard
which
governs
this
court.
although
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
that
way
because
if
they
are
using
the
wrong
legal
standard,
then
the
facts
that
they
find
may
have
very
little
applicability
to
what
this
court
might
want
to
decide.
but
to
the
extent
that
there
was
testimony
below
which
has
bearing
upon
the
changes
that
were
brought
about
by
the
city
of
lockhart,
it's
the
city's
position
that
the
changes
that
were
brought
about
had
a
retrogressive
impact,
first
based
upon
an
improper
legal
standard,
but
secondly,
they're
not
supportable
under
the
record
anyway.
the
finding
that
adoption
of
two
new
seats
using
numbered
places
and
using
an
off-year
election
has
retrogressive
impact
under
the
beer
decision
is
just
almost
indefensible.
and
i
know
that's
very
strong
language,
but
it
doesn't
make
logical
sense
in
the
sense
of
what
you
would
intuitively
expect
if
you
enlarge
a
city's
governing
body
and
the
impact
that
that
would
have
on
the
electability
of
a
minority.
it
doesn't
make
sense
with
respect
to
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
court.
the
only
evidence
before
the
court
which
was
based
upon
a
proper
standard
of
review...
that
is,
compare
the
system
in
effect
before
and
the
system
in
effect
after
and
make
your
decision
based
upon
that...
was
the
evidence
from
dr.
delbert
taebel,
an
expert
in
the
area,
who
said,
enlarging
a
city's
governing
body,
based
upon
my
studies,
generally
has
a
positive
impact
upon
the
electability
of
an
hispanic
minority.
and
he
has
tables
and
their
exhibits
in
the
court
below
are
in
the
record,
which
demonstrate
that
that
is
so.
now,
he
didn't
do
an
incremental
study
going
from
two
to
three
or
three
to
four
or
six
to
seven;
he
grouped
them
in
sizes,
small
councils,
medium
councils
and
large
councils
and
he
abstracted
his
conclusion
from
that.
but
nevertheless,
the
conclusion
is
there.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
it
was
presented
orally.
he
was
subject
to
cross
examination.
his
conclusion
was
that
enlarging
the
charter
didn't
have
just
a
neutral...
excuse
me,
enlarging
the
city's
governing
body
was
not
just
neutral
in
impact;
that
enlarging
it
has
a
positive
impact
on
the
minority
chances
for
election.
and
even
though
you
do
it
in
the
context
of
numbered
places,
as
the
new
places,
or
in
the
context
of
a
staggered
term,
that,
he
says,
does
not
erase
the
positive
impact
that
that
has
on
the
electability
of
a
minority.
the
government's
expert
witness
never
made
the
comparison
in
a
proper
way.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
third
expert
witness
testified...
that
would
be
dr.
cervantes
who
was
the
intervenor's
witness...
in
response
to
questions
by
judge
pratt
below
stated
that
well,
at
best,
it
was
neutral.
it
was
like
reading
the
same
issue
or
getting
two
issues
of
the
same
newspaper,
he
said.
doesn't
hurt
you
but
it
doesn't
help
you.
so
if
you're
comparing
it
under
the
proper
standard,
as
we
have
presented
it
here,
there
is
no
evidence
from
the
expert
testimony
of
any
adverse
impact.
the
final
thing,
and
the
government
points
this
up
in
its
brief
quite
clearly,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
political
theory
or
anything
like
that
in
determining
the
impact
of
the
charter
system
in
lockhart.
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
record
of
minority
participation
in
this
town
and
you'll
see
that
since
1970
voter
registration...
70
is
the
only...
we
don't
have
a
figure
for
1973
or
we'd
tie
it
down
a
little
closer.
we
have
figures
from
1970
through
77,
i
believe
it
is
that
show
that
voter
registration
has
increased
tremendously
in
the
minority
population
in
lockhart.
voter
participation
has
increased
tremendously.
the
number
of
minority
candidates
has
increased
tremendously
since
the
charter
was
adopted.
and
finally,
in
1978,
we
actually
had
a
member
of
the
mexican
american
community
elected
to
office
on
the
city
council
and
he
remains
in
office
today
since
we
haven't
had
any
other
elections.
so
you
have
logic
which
demands,
i
would
submit,
demands
a
finding
that
adoption
of
the
charter
had
positive
impact.
you
have
the
expert
testimony
which
says
it's
positive
or
at
worst,
neutral.
and
then
you
have
the
actual
experience.
so
it's
the
city's
position
that
the
court
below
just
got
off
on
the
wrong
track
and
ended
up
using
the
wrong
standard
of
comparison.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
well,
that
certainly
has
been...
there
has
been
a
flurry
of
activity
on
that
point.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
i
would
not
contest
that
point.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
i
understand
that
to
be
the
argument,
and
i
would
make
two
responses
to
that.
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
behind
the
adoption
of
section
2,
it's
got
some
40-odd
pages
that
talk
about
the
purpose
of
section
2
being
basically
to
revise
the
standard
which
this
court
set
out
in
the
city
of
mobile
versus
boulden.
and
they
go
into
exhausting
detail
about
the
pre-boulden
law
and
post-boulden
law.
they
were
aiming
at
that
and
they
clearly
demonstrate
that.
now,
you
do
have
a
footnote,
it's
a
sort
of
casual
aside
almost,
that
says
that
section
2
standards
ought
to
be
involved
in
a
section
5
proceeding.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
it's
just
in
the
legislative
history.
you
see,
they
modified
section
2.
but
section
5
which
had
been
interpreted
in
the
way
that
we
have
described
it
here
earlier,
retrogressive
effect
under
beer
since
1976,
the
congress
was
aware
of
how
this
court
had
been
interpreting
section
5
and
made
no
changes.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
no
changes
at
all.
it
remains
intact.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
well,
section
5
preclearance
was
never
intended
to
preclude
an
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
system.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
and
it
would
not,
in
any
way,
preclude
an
attack--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--the
purpose
of
section
5,
as
i
understand
it,
was
to
allow
a
quick
administrative
review
through
the
justice
department,
and
a
hearing
if
necessary
before
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
on
a
very
limited
nature.
but
the
section
2
findings,
or
the
section
2
standards
are
much
more
exhaustive
than
the
kind
of
evidence
that
would
be
presented.
it
puts
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
different
way.
section
5
is
on
the
city
and
in
a
section
2
proceeding
it
would
be
on
the
plaintiff.
and
i
think
it
would
over-burden
section
5,
as
was
set
out
in
this
history--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--where
the
witnesses
are
located,
where
there's
knowledge
of
the
local
law
if
that's
necessary,
and
avoid
the
expense
of
dragging
a
city
like
lockhart
with
7500
people
to
washington,
d.c.
to
fight
a
section
2--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--the
section
2/section
5
interrelationship?
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
well,
i
have
one
more
point
on
that,
mr.
justice
white,
which
i'd
like
to
suggest.
in
beer,
there's
a
footnote
in
96
supreme
court,
1364
and
some
language
in
there
that
deals
with
the
constitutional
inquiry
under
section
5.
and
when
i
first
read
the
section
2
suggestion
it
worried
me
a
lot,
but
basically,
section
2
as
i
understand
it
was
to
reinstate
the
constitutional
standards
which
the
congress
believed
existed
prior
to
boulden.
if
you
plug
that
understanding
back
into
section
2
and
put
that
into
section
5,
what
you
end
up
with
is
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
that
could
have
been
made
had
they
wanted
to,
but
they
didn't
make
it,
in
this
case,
in
the
district
court
below.
as
judge
robinson
says...
and
this
is
in
the
very
end
of
his
dissenting
opinion...
he
says
nobody
anywhere
in
this
litigation
has
contended
that
the
situation
in
lockhart
achieves
constitutional
dimensions
or
unconstitutional
dimensions.
or
something
to
that
effect.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
section
2
was
intended
to
reinstate
the
pre-goulden
law
which
was
presumably
followed
in--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--it
was
not
raised
at
the
proper
time
because
it
should
have
been
raised
under--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--but
the
underlying
of
section
2
could
have
been.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
in
the
constitutional
context.
and
there
was
authority
for
that
in
the
beer
decision
and
it
was
not
done
because
simply
that's--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--that's
correct.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
i
can
only
say
that
it
is
my
understanding
from
reviewing
section
2's
history
from
the
house
and
senate
records
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
restate
the
same
standards
that
had
previously
existed
under
the
constitutional
guidelines
laid
down
in
white
versus
register
and
the
other
at-large,
single-member
district
litigation.
in
other
words,
reaffirm
the
zimmer
criteria.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
i
believe
that
you
should
tell
the
district
court
to
resume
the
hearing
on
the
issue
of
intent.
they
bifurcated
the
trial
and
did
not
reach
that,
the
same
as
they
did
in
the
beer
case,
and--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--it
would
be
the
city's
position
that
if
there
were
violations
of
the
sort
that
would
have
raised
the
constitutional
issue
below,
they
should
have
been
raised
then,
and
it
shouldn't
be
raised
now,
going
back
down.
because
it's
the
same
inquiry
that
could
have
been
and
was
not
raised.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
with
the
section
2/section
5?
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
i
think
you
should
tell
the
district
court
that
first,
they
made
a
mistake
in
the
standard
that
they
applied
as
far--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--second,
that
they
don't
need
to
consider
section
2
because
the
same
issues
could
have
been
raised
the
first
time
through
in
the
context
of
an
allegation
of
unconstitutionality.
it
wasn't
raised,
by
the
way,
in
beer,
and
our
case
is
very
similar
to
theirs
in
that
respect.
so
all
they
need
to
do
then
is
proceed
to
hear
evidence
on
that
test.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
just
make
a
point
or
two
in
response
to
the
questions
that
were
raised
a
moment
ago.
regarding
judge
garcia's
ruling
and
the
prior
situation
that
lockhart
was
in
regarding
elections,
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
contains
the
key
finding
by
the
district
court
in
texas
below
where
it
says
among
the
major...
this
is
page
6a,
"among
the
major
changes
required
by
adoption
of
the
charter
was,
among
other
things,
adoption
of
the
numbered-place
system.
"
this
was
the
order
that
was
entered
in
1979.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
it's
the...
it's
not
the
record
itself.
it's
the
initial...
page
6a.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
the
point
is
that
in
the
supplemental
brief
we
filed
on
page
s4,
finding
number
11
is
the
corresponding
paragraph
in
the
order.
and
you
may
compare
the
paragraph
on
page
6a
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
full
paragraph,
to
that
order
and
see
the
change.
the
district
court
considered
all
the
arguments
that
were
raised
by
both
sides
regarding
the
impact
of
its
prior
order,
and
decided
that
the
order
initially
had
listed
numbered
places
as
a
change
which
should
not
be
used
in
subsequent
elections.
in
his
order
in
1982,
judge
garcia
says
enlarging
the
city
council
and
adopting
staggered
terms
are
the
changes.
just
as
we've
argued
here
before
you
today.
and
that
allows
us
to
continue
with
the
system
precisely
as
we
did
before
prior
to
adoption
of
the
charter.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
your
honor,
my
point
is
that
when
counsel
was
standing
here
a
moment
ago,
he
suggested
that
there
was
nothing
that
would
preclude
us
from
doing
it
i
the
first
place.
but
the
prior
order,
the
language
of
the
prior
order
on
page
6a
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
together
with
the
other
language
which
says
you
cannot
conduct
elections
pursuant
to
the
charter,
meant
that
the
city
could
not
use
numbered
places,
its
old
system,
nor
could
it
use
its
new
system.
and
it
sat
there
in
limbo
until
the
clarification--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--that's
correct.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
he
does
in
the
1982
order.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
but
in
71--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--i
can
only
go
outside
the
record
to
answer
that,
but
it
was
fully
briefed
as
vigorously
as
either
side
knew
how,
on
all
issues.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
we
take
that
position
initially,
yes.
we
take
the
secondary
position...
and
i
think
it's
more
important...
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
could
or
not.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
certainly
do.
but
we
didn't
feel
like
this
was
the
appropriate--
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
--judge
garcia.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
i
don't
know
whether
he
decided
that
or
whether
he
looked
at
the
voting
rights
act
and
decided
that
whatever
system
was
previously
in
place
could
be
carried
forward.
but
i
can
tell
the
court
that
both
of
those
issues
were
presented
to
him.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
i
don't
think
he
was
making
a
determination
about
retrogression
at
all
on
that
point.
mr.
walter
h.
mizell
i
think
it
was
just
an
interim
plan.
he
was
making
a
decision
as
to
how
we
could
go
forward,
and
he
decided
the
old
practice
was
appropriate.
thank
you.
my
time
has
expired.
