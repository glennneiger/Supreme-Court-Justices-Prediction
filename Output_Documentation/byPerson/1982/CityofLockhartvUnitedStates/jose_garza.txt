mr.
jose
garza
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
address
a
few
of
the
things
that
counsel
for
the
appellants
has
raised
in
regard
to
the
litigation
in
texas.
it
is
our
position,
in
terms
of
the
orders
that
were
issued
in
texas,
that
the
court
there
never
prohibited
the
city
from
reverting
to
the
prior
existing
election
system.
it
parrotted
the
letter
of
objection
from
the
department
of
justice
and
it
prohibited
elections
pursuant
to
an
election
system
within
the
charter.
additionally,
the
district
court
below
never
ruled
on
the
illegality
or
the
legality
of
using
numbered
posts
in
the
prior
existing
election
system.
and
in
fact,
the
district
court
in
this
case
below
did
not
base
its
finding
of
the
legality
or
its
finding
on
that
issue
on
any
ruling
out
of
the
texas
court.
that's
simply
not
the
case.
additionally,
some
of
the
facts
that
i
think
this
court
ought
to
consider
that
were
established
in
the
court
below
in
determining
the
backdrop
upon
which
the
lower
court
reviewed
the
election
change
are
several
points.
first
of
all,
the
record
below
shows
that
the
community
in
lockhart
is
a
divided
community;
substantial
segregated
housing
patterns
exist
and
were
brought
up
during
the
trial.
there
is
a
high
degree
of
racially
polarized
voting
in
the
election
system
in
lockhart.
and
race
becomes
an
issue
in
election
systems.
and
i
agree
with
counsel
for
the
appellants
that
one
need
not
theorize
about
the
impact
of
this
election
structure.
there
are
six
elections
that
were
conducted
using
the
post-charter
election
system
upon
which
one
can
measure
the
impact
of
that
election
structure
on
the
mexican
american
community
and
the
minority
community
in
lockhart.
in
those
six
elections,
seven
mexican
americans
have
run
for
office;
only
one
has
won.
an
election
rate
of
approximately
14
percent.
on
the
other
hand,
there
have
been
35
anglo
candidates,
and
15
have
been
successful
for
an
election
rate
of
43
percent.
what's
significant
in
this
situation
is
that
you
would
expect
a
drop-off
in
success
rate
for
anglos
because
they
opposed
each
other
in
some
elections.
there
were
no
mexican
americans
that
opposed
each
other.
significant
also
in
that
situation
is
that
anglo
candidates,
in
fact,
ran
unopposed
during
that
tenure.
no
mexican
american
ran
unopposed
during
that
tenure.
another
point
i
think
that's
important
in
determining
what
are
the
issues
before
this
court,
i
think
it
is
an
issue
whether
there
was
an
election
change.
the
appellant
suggests
that
the
only
election
change
was
the
enhancement
of
the
council;
the
increase
in
council
size.
our
position
is
that
the
election
change
that
subjects
the
review
of
the
election
plan
for
lockhart
is
a
change
in
government.
the
record
below
is
significant
on
this
point
in
terms
of
the
difference
between
the
two
structures.
the
general
law
city
and
the
home
rule
city.
there's
a
significant
difference.
dr.
cottrell
in
his
testimony
talked--
mr.
jose
garza
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
what
our
position
is
that
the
system
that
was
adopted
within
the
charter
is
discriminatory.
there
is
a
constitutional
challenge
that
was
filed
in
texas
to
the
at-large
election
system.
what
we
would
want
is
single-member
districts.
but
i
think
in
terms
of
what
we
have
before
us
now,
the
election
system
adopted
by
the
city
of
lockhart
is
discriminatory
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
on.
i
think--
mr.
jose
garza
--i
think
what
you
would
go
back
to
is,
in
terms
of
your
election
structure,
what
you
had
under
a
general
law
city;
that
is,
an
at-large
plurality,
no
place
system.
there
is
significant--
mr.
jose
garza
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
jose
garza
no.
there
was
no
charter
for
the
city
prior
to
its
adoption;
it
was
a
general
law
city.
there
was
no
authorization--
mr.
jose
garza
--the
city
would
have
to
revert
back
to
a
legal
system.
the
legal
system
would
be
one
without
the
numbered--
mr.
jose
garza
--that's
correct.
mr.
jose
garza
it's
because
of
texas
law.
it
does
not
authorize...
a
general
law
city
is
only
authorized
to
implement
those
features
that
are
specifically
authorized
by
texas
law.
no
texas
law
authorizes
use
of
numbered
post
provisions.
i
think
the
record
is
significant
on
that
point.
not
only
do
we
have
the
texas
statute
or
the
absence
in
the
texas
statute
of
that
authorization;
we
have
testimony
by
dr.
cottrell
that
he's
done
a
survey
of
cities
in
texas--
mr.
jose
garza
--yes.
mr.
jose
garza
they
have
stated
that
they
don't,
but
they
have
not
presented
any
substantial
contrary
position--
mr.
jose
garza
--the
only
mention
of
an
election
system
in
the
district
judge's
order
is
that
they
should
go
to
the
pre-existing
election
system.
mr.
jose
garza
which
is
the
election
system
under
a
general
law
city.
mr.
jose
garza
the
judge
never
made
a
ruling.
and
in
fact,
we--
mr.
jose
garza
--we
made
a
specific
request
the
judge
have
a
hearing
and
make
a
ruling
on
that
specific
issue,
and
the
judge
decided,
without
giving
reason,
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
any--
mr.
jose
garza
--he
restored
the
old
system.
mr.
jose
garza
i
don't
think
that
he
felt
that.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jose
garza
no.
i
think
that
he
felt
that
it
wasn't
proper
for
him
to
decide
that
issue;
that
it
was
an
issue
for
the
state
courts.
but
that's
my
assumption
because
there's
nothing
in
the
order--
mr.
jose
garza
--i
think
his
only
obligation
was
to
enjoin
the
use
of
an
unpre-cleared
election
system.
and
that's
what
the
initial
order
called
for,
and
that's
what
the
subsequent
order
called
for.
i
think
a
significant
point
on
this,
in
terms
of
the
election
change
that
occurred,
is
that
no
longer
can...
if
this
election
structure
is
precleared...
no
longer
will
the
minority
community
in
lockhart
have
the
option
of
challenging
the
numbered-post
provision
as
a
violation
of
state
law.
i
think
that's
an
election
change
as
well,
that
the
district
court
relied
on
in
its
ruling.
no
longer
will
the
minority
community
have
the
option
of
going
to
state
court
and
having
removed
the
election
system
with
numbered
posts
if
the
city
chooses
to
do
that.
now,
i
think
what's
interesting
here,
too,
is
that
the
city
of
lockhart
has,
in
fact,
passed
a
resolution
calling
for
elections
in
april,
without
mention
as
to
whether
it
will
use
numbered
posts.
and
in
fact,
has
requested
of
its
city
attorney
that
it
issue
a
legal
opinion
as
to
whether
the
numbered
post
can
be
legally
implemented
in
the
april
1983
election
system.
the
evidence
before
the
court
on
that
issue
not
only
involved,
as
i
said,
the
review
of
texas
law,
but
also
involved
the
testimony
of
riley
fletcher,
who
is
the
general
counsel
of
the
municipal
league
in
texas.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
that
the
district
court
in
washington,
d.c.
has
a
duty
to
examine
what
the
discriminatory
impact
of
an
election
change
is.
and
in
doing
that,
must
analyze
that
system
against
what
is
authorized
under
texas
law.
the
district
court
in
texas
does
not
have
the
power
under
section
5
to
analyze
the
impact
of
an
election
system.
it
simply
must
adhere
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
washington.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
what's
significant
in
that,
justice
rehnquist,
is
just
having
the
challenge,
just
having
the
possibility
that
that
system
is
illegal
and
no
question
at
all
but
that
it
is
legal
under
the
charter,
i
think
that
signifies
a
change
that
the
district
court
talked
about...
no
longer,
after
the
adoption
of
the
charter,
will
the
minority
community
in
lockhart
have
the
opportunity
to
challenge
a
feature
that
everybody
admits
has
the
potential
for
discriminating
against
the
mexican
americans.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
we
have...
since
the
filing
of
the
1979
action,
through
today,
there
has
not
been
the
opportunity
to
go
back
to
texas
and
the
state
courts
and
challenge
that.
first
of
all,
because
no
elections
have
been
called
that
would
use
the
numbered
post
provision.
number
two,
the
city,
in
its
resolution
passed
this
summer
calling
for
elections
for
april,
does
not
specifically
say
whether
it's
going
to
use
the
numbered
posts
or
not.
since
the
filing
of
the
action
there
has
been
no
opportunity,
therefore,
for
the
minority
community
to,
in
fact,
challenge
that
provision
in
state
court.
mr.
jose
garza
advisory
opinions
are
not
proper
under
texas
law.
mr.
jose
garza
yes,
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
jose
garza
right.
there
have
not
been
any
elections,
there
have
not
been
any
elections
called
under
that
system.
the
declaratory
judgment
would
go
to
a
determination
if,
in
fact,
they
were
going
to
use
that
system.
there
is
no
indication
at
this
point
that
they
will
use
that
system.
mr.
jose
garza
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
situation
where
it's
clear
that
that
future
act
will
be
taken.
there
is
no
indication
in
texas
that
that's
what's
going
to
proceed.
mr.
jose
garza
there
is
no
certainty
that
they
will
use
the
numbered
post
provision
in
those
elections.
mr.
jose
garza
they
have...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jose
garza
they
were...
the
restraining
order
did
not
prohibit
them
from
using
it.
that's
right.
the
restraining
order
only
spoke
to
the
election
system
under
the
charter.
that's...
the
district
court
in
texas
i
assume
felt
that
their
jurisdiction
only
went
to
that.
that
their
authority
only
went
to
prohibiting
the
unpre-cleared
election
change.
mr.
jose
garza
but
we
would
have...
if
there
is
no
pre-clearance
of
the
charter,
we
would
have
the
opportunity
to
go
into
texas
state
courts,
and
i
think
rather
quickly--
mr.
jose
garza
--preclude
the
use
of
the
numbered
post
provision.
we
do
not
have
that
opportunity
at
this
point,
and
we
will
not
for
sure
if
the
charter
is
pre-cleared.
mr.
jose
garza
yes.
i
think
in
analyzing
perkins
we
must
look
at
the
underlying,
underpinning
purpose
of
the
ruling
in
perkins.
in
fact,
perkins
said
that
in
a
situation
where
they're
trying
to
make
a
system
comply
with
the
law
in
new
orleans,
in
louisiana,
that
they
had
to
get
pre-clearance.
that's
what
we're
saying
in
texas.
in
addition,
the
perkins
court
specifically
said
that
they
were
not
going
to
allow
political
jurisdiction
subject
to
section
5
to
profit
by
its
prior
illegal
activity.
a
ruling
based
on
perkin
in
this
situation
that
we
cannot
challenge
the
legality
or
cannot
base
the
election
change
from
illegal
to
legal
in
this
situation
would
have
just
the
opposite
impact,
that
the
perkins
court
sought
to
avoid.
an
additional
point
i
think
that
needs
to
be
made
in
terms
of
the
retrogressive
impact
of
the
election
change
in
lockhart
is
the
use
of
staggered
terms
for
the
first
time.
the
testimony
and
the
record
reveals
that
staggered
terms
result
in
lowering
the
voter
turnout
generally.
and
testimony
also
reveals
that
when
there
is
lower
voter
turnout,
it
impacts
disproportionately
upon
the
minority
community.
that,
in
fact,
is
the
record
in
lockhart.
in
the
election
where
turnout
was
the
lowest,
it
was
significantly
lower
among
the
mexican
american
population.
and
that
was
an
additional
reason
for
the
ruling
of
the
district
court.
finally,
i
think
the
final
point
in
this
situation
is
that
section
2,
even
if
there
is
no
retrogression,
section
2
would
preclude
a
pre-clearance.
the
senate
report
in
the
footnote
that
was
referred
to
earlier
i
think
is
quite
clear
that
if
there
is
on
retrogression,
the
election
system
can
still
be
measured
under
the
results
test
that
was
developed
for
the
amendment
of
section
2.
the
beer
case
talks
about
the
going
beyond
retrogression
standard
and
insuring
that
an
election
system
is
not
unconstitutional.
at
that
time,
section
2
incorporated
the
constitutional
standard.
now
it
incorporates
the
results
test.
and
i
think
it
would
be...
the
debate
on
the
house
floor
referred
to
the
impact
of
the
amendment
on
section
2
and
the
footnote.
and
congressman
edwards,
in
reply
to
a
question,
in
fact,
said
that
an
election
change
under
section
5
should
meet
not
only
the
retrogression
standard
but
also,
the
results
standard
under
section--
mr.
jose
garza
--well,
i
think
it's
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
section
5.
one
of
the
purposes
of
section
5
was
to
avoid
lengthy
litigation
based
on
the
constitutional
standard,
or
the
section
2
standard,
by
having
this
kind
of
review
and
assuring
that
an
election
change
does
not
have
the
discriminatory
impact.
i
think
it
would
be
consistent
with
that
goal
to
interpret
section
2
and
the
amendments
to
section
2--
mr.
jose
garza
--yes.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
that
it
must
be
shown
to
the
satisfaction
to
the
district
court
that
there
is
no
retrogression
and
that
also,
there
is
no
discriminatory
result.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
the
starting
point
is
the
retrogression
standard.
but
the
court
must
determine
that,
in
fact,
the
election
change
does
not
have
a
discriminatory
result.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
supports
a
section
2
violation
in
terms
of
just
the
numbers
showing
that
the
system
is
not
equally
open
to
members
of
the
minority
community,
and
that
election
history
has
been--
mr.
jose
garza
--i
think
that
would
be
proper.
mr.
jose
garza
i
think
the
court
must
find
that
there
has
been
no
retrogression
and
the
court
below
was
clearly
erroneous
in
its
conclusion.
if
that
is,
in
fact,
the
case
i
think
it
would
be
proper
for
remand
not
only
on
the
intent
question
but
also
on
the
section
2
question.
in
summary,
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
few
things.
section
5,
from
its
inception,
as
was
stated
in
georgia
versus
the
united
states,
is
concerned
with
the
real
impact
of
an
election
change;
not
merely
an
inventory
of
features
of
an
election
system.
and
the
history
in
lockhart
of
the
post-charter
election
system
clearly
demonstrates
a
discriminatory
impact
from
that
election
system.
seven
mexican
american
candidates,
six
losers,
marred
by
racial
block
voting,
marred
by
racial
techniques
during
the
campaign.
the
minority
community
post-charter
was
being
sent
a
very
clear
message,
and
that
message
is
that
you
can't
come
into
the
political
process.
if
the
promise
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
to
be
fulfilled,
the
election
system
that
is
implement
in
lockhart
cannot
receive
pre-clearance.
thank
you.
