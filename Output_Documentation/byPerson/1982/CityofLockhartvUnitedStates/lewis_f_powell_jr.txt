justice

f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
garza,
it
would
help
me
to
know
whether
the
bottom
line
really
of
your
position
is
you'd
like
to
return
to
the
old
form
of
government
in
this
town.
would
you
like
to
go
back
to
the
1917
charter?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
that
mean
you'd
go
back
to
the
election
system
that
existed
from
1917?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
is
that
this
particular
city,
although
it
was
a
general
law
city,
had
a
mayor
elected
at
large
and
two
commissioners
elected
from
numbered
posts
by
a
plurality
vote.
and
is
that
what
you
want
to
go
back
to?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
want
to
write
a
new
charter?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
understand
that.
you
have
a
charter
now
and
that's
what
you're
attacking.
but
i'm
trying
to
get
clear
in
my
own
mind
what
you
want
to
go
back
to,
or
do
you
want
to
write
a
new
form
of
government
because
of
constitutional
defects
in
the
old
1917
organization.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
saying
it's
been
illegal
since
1917.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that's
because
of
the
constitution,
not
because
of
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
saying
the
invalidity
is
a
matter
of
texas
law,
primarily.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
first
of
these
cases,
81-802,
city
of
lockhart
against
the
united
states
involves
a
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
it
is
here
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia,
appellant,
a
small
community
in
texas,
changed
its
form
of
government
in
1973.
the
new
charter
provided
for
a
mayor
and
four
councilmen
replacing
a
mayor
and
two
commissioners,
the
various
proceedings
after
various
proceedings
not
irrelevant.
the
district
court
held
that
the
new
charter
was
subject
to
section
5
of
the
act
and
concluded
provisions
for
numbered
post
and
staggered
post
that
had
a
discriminatory
effect
on
protected
minorities.
the
district
court
did
not
consider
whether
the
plan
also
had
a
discriminatory
purpose.
we
agree
that
section
5
required
preclearance
of
the
entire
plan.
we
do
not
agree
that
it
had
a
discriminatory
effect.
in
1976,
in
beer
against
the
united
states,
we
held
that
section
5
applies
only
to
changes
in
voting
procedures
that
have
a
retrogressive
effect
on
minority
voting
strength.
applying
the
principle
of
our
decision
in
beer,
we
hold
that
the
use
of
numbered
post
and
staggered
terms
in
the
city's
new
plan
will
not
have
a
retrogressive
effect.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
