justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
garza,
it's
your
position
then
that
even
had
there
been
no
increase
in
the
number
of
positions
or
any
change
to
staggered
terms,
that
the
mere
adoption
of
home
rule
charter
would
trigger
a
section
5
review.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
garza,
certainly
there
is
language
in
the
perkins
case
that
would
indicate
that
what
the
court
should
look
at
in
the
section
5
review
is
the
system
actually
being
employed,
rather
than
something
that
perhaps
was
mandated
by
state
law
that's
different.
isn't
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
clear
whether
he
thought
that
there
was
no
coverage
for
purposes
of
section
5
review
as
a
result
of
that,
or
that
he
looked
at
it
and
found
no
retrogressive
effect;
that
there
was
a
coverage
issue
but
it
wasn't
retrogressive?
