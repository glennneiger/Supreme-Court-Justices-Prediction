justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
section
2...
the
amendment
to
section
2
couldn't
have
changed
the
constitutional
standard.
what
it
did
is
substitute
a
statutory
standard
in
section
2
for
what
was
previously
a
constitutional
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
really
wasn't
a
chance
before
the
amendment
was
made
to
argue
this
point,
i
wouldn't
think.
because
let's
assume
there's
no
constitutional
violation;
everybody
agrees.
it's
nevertheless
possible
that
there
is
a
statutory
violation
and
that
somebody
has
to
decide
it
sometime.
i'm
not
saying
there
is
either,
but
it's
certainly
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
argument.
what
is
your
view
of
what
would
be
open
on
remand
if
we
agree
with
everything
you've
said
up
to
the
second
2
discussion?
what
should
we
tell
the
district
court
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
also
to
ask
them
to
consider
the
question
whether
section
2
is
now
relevant
without
us
necessarily
deciding
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
could
make
the
argument
that
numbered
posts
or
staggered
terms
have
an
effect
or
result
that's
specifically
intended
to
be
prohibited
by
section
2.
again,
i'm
not
saying
that's
right.
but
are
you
saying
that
we
should
decide
whether
or
not
that's
true,
or
we
should
tell
the
district
court
to
decide
it?
what
should
be
done
with
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garza,
though,
did
not
the
recent
order
by
the
district
court
in
texas
indicate
that
they
were
free
to
use
the
old
system,
which
would
include
numbered
posts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
if
they
should
do
in
the
future
what
they
last
did
in
the
past,
they
would
be
using
numbered
posts,
i
would
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean,
mr.
mizell,
that
you
take
the
position
that
as
a
matter
of
texas
law,
a
general
law
city
could
use
numbered
posts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that
position.
but
you
think
that
your
opponent
is
wrong
on
texas
law.
