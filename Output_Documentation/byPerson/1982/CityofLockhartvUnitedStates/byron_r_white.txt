justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
a
majority
vote
or
plurality?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
seem
to
suggest
then
that
this
was
a
change,
subject
to
section
5.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
that
always
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
said
it
wasn't
even
subject
to
preclearance.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
concede
that
it
was
a
change
that
must
satisfy
the
beer
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
suggestion
that
the
amendment
to
section
2
has
an
impact
on
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there...
if
the
law
has
been
changed
in
a
way
that
affects
this
case,
don't
we
have
to
judge
this
case
based
on
the
current
law
rather
than
on
some
prior
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
change
does
have
an
impact,
but
the
argument
is
that
section
2
means
that
even
if
this
was
not
a
regressive
change,
you
must
nevertheless...
it
must
nevertheless
pass
muster
under
section
2.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
say
a
city
makes
a
change
that
everybody
agrees
is
a
change.
they
seek
preclearance
from
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
they
get
it.
based
on
beer,
it
was
not
retrogressive.
then
i
take
it
that
if
you
say
that
section
2
should
not
be
taken
into
account
in
a
section
5
proceeding,
then
the
people
who
object
to
the
plan
can
then
just
sue
in
the
district
court
in
their
home
county
and
say
there's
a
violation
of
section
2,
even
despite
the
preclearance.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
that
awfully
wasteful
of
litigation
to
say
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
would
have
been...
would
be
disentitled
to
recognize
the
possible
illegality
of
the
plan
under
section
2?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
there's
got
to
be
section
2
litigation
it
ought
to
go
on
back
in
the
home
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
have
to
deal
with
this
point
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you're
saying
is
that
even
if
section
2
was
relevant
here,
it's
been
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
couldn't
have
been
raised
because
the
amendments
hadn't
been
passed
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
a
constitutional--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
division
did
the
district
judge
put
in,
lately?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
a
numbered
post
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can't
imagine
the
judge
thought
that
that
prior
system
should
be
put
back
in
if
it
was
unauthorized
by
texas
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
must
we
assume--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
he
nevertheless
restored
the
old
system,
at
least
temporarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
he
nevertheless,
that
he
didn't
believe
that
it
was
valid
under
texas
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
suggestion
is
that
both
the
attorney
general,
if
things
are
presented
to
him,
and
the
court
must
consider
section
2
in
pre-clearance.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
that
if
the
system
is
to
go
ahead,
it's
going
to
have
to
pass
muster
under
both
section
5
and
section
2.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
take
it,
then,
that
if
you
approach
the
section
5
issue
first,
if
you
pre-clear
it,
you're
nevertheless
going
to
have
to
go
to
section
2.
so
what
should
you
start
with
in
a
pre-clearance
proceeding;
section
2
or
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
which
should
you
start
with?
i
think
it
makes
some
difference;
if
section
2
is
really
the
issue
at
the
threshold,
that
issue
certainly
should
be
decided
by
the
district
court
first,
before
we
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
the
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
order
on
page
s8
expressly
says
that
you're
allowed
to
conduct
elections
pursuant
to
the
pre-existing
electoral
system.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
no
question
that
the
pre-existing
electoral
system
used
numbered
places.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
expressly
permits
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
my
interest
is
whether
he...
whether
we
must
assume
that
he
considered
the
legality
of
it
under
texas
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
judge
garza...
what
was
his
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
judge
garcia
must
have
thought
the
numbered
post
system
in
a
general
law
city
was
all
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
an
interim
plan.
