justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
were
you
suggesting
that
in
an
election
at-large
that
a
city
with
a
third
of
its
voters
black,
that
they
would
have
no
influence,
that
neither
candidate
would
pay
any
attention
to
obtaining
their
vote?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
typical
across
the
south
today?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
the
position
of
the
government
that
a
majority
vote
is
never
appropriate?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it's
the
general
rule
across
the
united
states,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
may
i
get
clear,
is
purpose
still
in
this
case
at
this
level?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
we
consider
only
the
effect?
