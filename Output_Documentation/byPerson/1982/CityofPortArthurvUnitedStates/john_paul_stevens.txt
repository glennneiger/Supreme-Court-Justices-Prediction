justice
john
paul
stevens
refresh
my
recollection.
the
figures
are
40
percent
population
and
35
percent
voting
age.
do
we
know
the
percentage
of
registered
voters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
of
procedure?
i
wonder
why
you
and
your
adversaries
in
the
litigation
didn't
simply
dismiss
the
lawsuit,
voluntarily
go
in
and
ask
this
case
be
dismissed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
not
imply,
then,
that
the
court
had
some
power
to
approve
or
disapprove
of
the
appropriate
remedy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
was
required
as
a
matter
of
law...
they
had
absolutely
no
discretion
in
the
matter...
to
accept
anything
that
was
acceptable
to
the
attorney
general?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
there
been
a
trial
on
the
question
whether
the
4-2-3
plan
satisfies
the
richmond
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
at
least
not
theoretically
possible
that
there
was
some
invidious
purpose
in
the
adoption
of
this
plan
rather
than
some
possible
alternative?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i'm
just
wondering,
how
can
you
be
so
positive
that
it
does...
i
mean,
i
don't
see
any
reason
it
doesn't
meet
the
plan.
but
how
can
we
say
that
it's
been
settled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
meets
the
standards
of
richmond?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
because
the
attorney
general
didn't
object,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
supposing,
instead
of
the
attorney
general
agreeing
to
the
plan,
he
said,
i
would
agree
to
it
if
you
impose
the
plurality
requirement,
and
you
had
said,
well,
we
don't
have
to
do
that.
you'd
make
the
same
argument
you
make
today,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
attorney
general's
consent
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
issue
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
controlling
fact
again
is
that
the
record
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
on
the
question
whether
it
satisfies
the
richmond
standard.
that's
your
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
which
perhaps
isn't
directly
before
us,
but
i'm
curious
about.
the
district
court's
opinion
indicated
that
the
original
annexation
was
infected
with
an
invidious
purpose,
as
i
recall
the
opinion.
and
nevertheless,
it
found
that
there
were
subsequent
legitimate
reasons
for
the
annexation
that
overcome
the
original
invidious
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
holding
is
consistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
rogers
against
lucas
last
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it's
consistent
with
the
voting
rights
act
to
have
a
mixed
motive
for
a
change?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
no
problem?
