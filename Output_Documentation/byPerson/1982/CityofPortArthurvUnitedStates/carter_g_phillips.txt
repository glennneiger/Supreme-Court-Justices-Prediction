mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
involving
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
refusing
to
preclear
the
city
of
port
arthur's
post-annexation
electoral
plan
so
long
as
the
city
insisted
on
including
a
majority
vote
requirement
for
the
election
at
large
of
two
members
of
the
city
council.
in
the
view
of
the
government,
the
issue
is
an
exceedingly
narrow
one.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
annexations
of
lakeview,
pear
ridge,
and
sabine
pass
are
subject
to
the
requirements
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
effect
of
those
annexations
is
to
significantly
dilute
the
minority
voting
strength
in
the
city
of
port
arthur,
in
the
expanded
city
of
port
arthur.
indeed,
there
is
some
reason
to
suspect,
from
the
findings
of
the
district
court
with
regard
to
the
4-4-1
plan,
that
the
motivation,
at
least
in
part,
for
the
expansion
of
the
city
of
port
arthur
was
to
assure
that
the
white
majority
retained
its
status
as
the
majority
for
the
foreseeable
future.
thus
we
are
all
in
agreement
that
the
basic
test
to
be
satisfied
is
that
announced
by
the
court
in
the
city
of
richmond
decision.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
largely
because
the
beer
case
deals
with
a
situation
where
there's
simply
a
change
in
an
electoral
practice
dealing
with
a
pre-existing
city
and
that
city
remains
as
it
is,
whereas--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
clearly
not.
but
this
court's
decision
in
city
of
richmond
seems
to
indicate,
or
at
least
imply,
and
again
in
the
city
of
rome,
that
the
proper
test
is
not
an
analysis
of
retrogression,
but
rather
the
dilution
of
the
minority
vote
comes
from
the
annexation
in
the
first
instance.
and
the
requirement
is
that
the
minority
community
be
adequately
represented
in
the
post-annexation
city.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
sir.
in
the
city's
view,
this
court's
decision
in
city
of
richmond
imposes
a
bright-line
test
measuring
the
propriety
of
the
city's
post-annexation
electoral
plan.
in
our
view,
that
simply
does
not
square
with
the
language
of
the
test.
the
test
looks
for
whether
or
not
there
is
fair
or
reasonable
representation.
but
its
terms,
it
is
not
a
bright-line
test.
it
requires
the
exercise
of
judgment
by
the
tryer
of
fact
and
by
the
court
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
particular
plan
satisfies
the
voting
rights
act.
indeed,
given
the
variable
types
of
plans
that
are
available
and
subject
to
review
under
city
of
richmond,
it
is
inconceivable
that
there
can
be
any
kind
of
a
bright-line
test.
in
this
case
we
have
a
mixed
at-large
and
single
member
district
plan.
in
city
of
richmond
there
was
a
single
member
district
plan.
city
of
rome
involved
an
all
at-large
plan.
it's
just
impossible
to
come
up
with
some
test
that
will
adequately
resolve
all
of
those
different
situations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so.
both
sides
in
this
case
complain
that
the
other
has
failed
to
look
at
the
plan
in
its
entirety.
our
submission
is
that
the
city
is
the
party
with
tunnel
vision.
specifically,
the
city
looks
at
the
single
member
district
portions
of
this
plan,
finds
that
they
will
provide
a
certain
amount
of
representation,
and
then
completely
ignores
the
rest
of
the
plan.
our
position
is
that
admittedly
the
single
member
district
aspects
of
this
plan
go
a
long
way
toward
satisfying
the
voting
rights
act.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not
have
been
up
here
under
those
circumstances.
our
position
is
that
it
was
a
close
question.
i
think
our
joint
submission
to
the
district
court
makes
it
clear
we
believe
it
is
a
close
question.
the
district
court
viewed
the
facts
somewhat
differently
from
the
way
we
viewed
the
facts
and
drew
different
inferences
from
them
and
concluded
on
balance
that
the
4-2-3
plan
with
the
majority
vote
requirement
could
not
guarantee
adequate
representation
to
the
minority.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
that
judgment
we
believe
is
entitled
to
respect.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
because
it
is
based
on
a
set
of
findings
that
we
believe
are
not
clearly
erroneous,
and
once
you
accept
those
findings,
viewed
through
the
prism
of
the
district
court's
july
14th
order,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
other
conclusion
that's
available
at
this
point.
specifically,
there
are
four
facts
that
we
regard,
that
the
district
court
found,
that
we
think
control
this
case:
first,
the
city
of
port
arthur
faces
severe
racial
block
voting.
the
statistic
that's
used
in
this
case
is
one
that
demonstrates
statistically
significant
polarization
at
the.5
or.6
level,.5
or.6.
elections
just
prior
to
the
annexation
in
this
case
involved
racial
polarization
at.8
and
above.
accordingly,
it
is
clear
that
this
is
a
badly
divided
city
on
the
basis
of
race.
an
even
more
important
finding
in
our
view
is
the
district
court's
conclusions
that
with
at-large
seats
and
a
majority
vote
election
the
black
community
has
no
opportunity
to
influence
any
elections
at
large.
that
is,
even
white
versus
white
candidates,
the
black
community
is
unable...
has
no
more
than
a
mere
theoretical
possibility
of
exercising
a
swing
vote
influence.
accordingly,
the
ultimate
effect
of
this
plan
as
viewed
from
the
district
court's
perspective
must
be
to
discard
the
black
community
or
eliminate
the
black
community's
influence
over
six
of
the
nine
seats
of
the
city
council.
third,
the
district
court
found
that
in
the
past
when
there
is
a
majority
white
population
controlling
the
politics
in
the
city
of
port
arthur,
there
is
a
pervasive
and
systematic
disregard
for
the
black
community,
a
systematic
disregard
that
we
submit,
the
court
would
conclude,
will
continue
into
the
future
unless
this
plan
is
modified.
finally--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
agree
that
the
order
is
not
artfully
drafted,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court
made
clear
its
understanding
of
the
two
strands
of
analysis
required
by
the
city
of
richmond
test.
and
it
had
already
approved
the
annexation,
and
all
that
was
left
was
the
adequacy
of
the
voting
plan
adopted
for
the
expanded
city.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
perceive
that
any
of
the
litigants
disagree
with
regard
to
what
the
effect
of
the
district
court's
order
was
and
what
it
was
intended
to
be.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor.
in
our
brief
we
argue
that
we
think
that
both
data
have
a
legitimate
role
to
inform
the
judgment
of
the
court.
admittedly,
voting
age
population
suggests
the
immediate
effect
of
a
change,
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
raw
population--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
it's
error?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
purpose
of
the
voting
rights
act
and
the
approval
of
these
changes
is
to
determine
their
future
effect,
and
i
would
think
it
would
raise
serious
question
if
you
completely
disregarded
what
might
be
the
potential
effect.
assuming
the
voting
age
population
is
just
significantly
different
from
the
overall
population,
it
might
create
a
problem.
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
difference
is
not
that
significant,
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
that
it
would
be
very
difficult.
the
fourth
finding
that
we
think
is
significant
from
the
district
court's
june
12th
opinion
is
its
conclusion
that
residency
districts
do
not
offer
the
black
community
any
greater
influence
over
no
residency
districts,
because
of
the
pockets
of
white
influence
in
the
black
districts
and
accordingly
the
availability
of
white
candidates,
who
in
at-large
elections
will
continue
to
maintain
the
domination
of
the
white
community
in
port
arthur.
based
on
these
findings,
we
believe
that
the
district
court
could
conclude,
legitimately
conclude
in
the
exercise
of
its
equitable
judgment,
that
this
plan
does
not
satisfy
the
voting
rights
act,
and
that
a
single
minor
modification
would
be
required,
should
be
required
in
order
to
assure
that
blacks
will
have
influence
in
the
future
in
these
elections.
that
modification
is
the
elimination
of
the
majority
vote
requirement.
that
elimination
in
no
way
offers
the
black
community
the
opportunity
to
control
additional
seats.
it
merely
grants
them
the
right
to
have
influence
over
the
elected
officials
from
those
districts
in
the
at-large
elections,
and
that
we
think
is
an
appropriate
exercise.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
court
in
its
june
12
opinion
is
exactly
to
that
effect,
that
in
only
one
or
two
elections
in
the
14
years
prior
to
1977
could
it
find
any
evidence
to
indicate
that
there
might
have
been
a
swing
vote
influence.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
would
hope
not,
your
honor.
i'm
not
an
expert
on
that
and
i
would
guess
that
it's
not
always
the
case.
certainly,
city
of
rome,
the
district
court
found
that
in
that
community
blacks
had
exercised
significant
influence.
that's
part
of
the
reason
why
we
believe
our
submission
in
this
case
is
a
very
narrow
one.
we
think
the
city
of
port
arthur
is
an
unusual
situation,
based
on
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
and
that's
why
we
have
to
look
beyond
simply
whether
rough
proportional
representation
that's
provided
from
the
three
single
member
districts
adequately
protects
the
interests
of
the
minority
community
in
the
expanded
city.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
certainly
in
a
situation--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is.
and
the
city
has
argued
in
its
reply
brief
that
our
position
is
a
per
se
rejection
of
that
view.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
not
in
terms
of
the
submission
to
this
court,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
the
district
court's
opinion
or
order
can
fairly
be
read
to
cast
any
doubt
on
the
purpose
of
the
plan
as
adopted.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
don't
think
the
united
states'
position
is
that
this
is
infected
with
an
invidious
purpose,
so
i
suspect
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
litigate,
although
the
intervenors
might
take
a
view
different
from
that
at
this
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
the
district
court
submission...
the
district
court's
order
seems
to
indicate
rather
clearly
that
if
the
city
were
prepared
to
remove
this
one
objectionable
feature
that
seems
to
be
directly
related
to
the
effect
of
this
plan,
that
it
would
be
satisfactory.
the
overall
arrangement
is
itself
not
in--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
not
actually,
not
as
a
matter
of
logic
i
don't
think,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
the
case,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
significantly
different,
and
if
anything
are
easily
controlled
by
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
both
city
of
richmond
and
city
of
rome.
city
of
richmond,
the
black
community
was
entitled
on
the
basis
of
the
single
member
districts
to
have
essentially
four
representatives
and
a
serious
swing
vote
influence
in
a
fifth
district
out
of
nine,
and
that
for
a
population
of
approximately
41
percent.
city
of
rome
involved
an
all
at-large
plurality
vote
system
that
was
characterized
by
the
district
court
itself
as
an
essentially
fair
one,
and
yet
the
district
court
felt
compelled
to
remove
the
single
residency
requirement
in
that
case,
and
this
court
upheld
that
exercise
of
judgment.
we
believe
that
these
facts
suggest
a
much
worse
situation
for
the
black
community
and
that
the
district
court's
judgment
in
eliminating
the
largest
impediment
to
the
opportunity
to
influence
the
city
council
is
a
reasonable
judgment
by
the
district
court
and
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is...
i
hadn't
really
thought
of
that.
it
is
clearly
consistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
city
of
richmond.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
problem
is
that
annexations
create
unusual
problems
and
therefore
you
sort
of
have
to
examine
them
as
a
unique
situation,
i
think.
