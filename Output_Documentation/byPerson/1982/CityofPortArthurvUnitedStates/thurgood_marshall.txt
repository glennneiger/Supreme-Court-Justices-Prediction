mr.
phillips--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--have
you
taken
into
consideration,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
way
land
is
annexed
in
texas
and
the
way
land
is
annexed
in
virginia?
they're
entirely
different,
aren't
they?
the
question
is,
does
that
have
any
bearing
on
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
is
it
true
that
all
the
property
annexed
was
predominantly
white?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
that
is
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
invidious?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
were
the
same
number
of
black
and
white
people
annexed?
the
answer
is
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
they
were
white.
