well,
you
did
have
intervenors
below,
did
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
fact
that
intervenors
are
permitted
in
a
proceeding
like
this
suggest
that
they
may
be
able
to
urge
arguments
that
may
not
appeal
to
the
government
and
still
might
commend
themselves
to
the
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
no.
if
the
attorney
general...
you
didn't
have
to
deal
with
the
attorney
general
to
go
to
court.

mr.
phillips,
why
doesn't
the
beer
case
control
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
nothing
in
beer
that
limits
it
to
that
or
says
that
it
isn't
applicable
to
annexations.
