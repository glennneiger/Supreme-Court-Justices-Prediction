justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
the
only
issue
that
we
have
up
here,
is
the
district
court's
insistence
on
the
plurality?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
the
district
court
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
because.
only
because--
justice
byron
r.
white
--of
the
plurality.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
said
if
you
didn't
have
this
head
to
head
majority
vote
business
you
would
have
neutralized
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
issue
about
purpose
in
this
plan,
this
particular
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
terms
of
the
voting
rights
act,
what
the
court
said
is
that
this
will
have
an
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
will
have
an
effect
of
diluting
minority
voting
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
prior
plans
they
found
had
been
purposefully
discriminatory.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
case
you
lost,
was
lost
on
purpose,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
never
would
have
needed
to
have
gotten
to
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
have
to
deal
with
him
at
all.
and
if
the
attorney
general
hadn't
been
in
this
suit
or
hadn't
been
participating
in
this
thing
at
all,
and
you
lost
the
first
lawsuit
and
then
you
proposed
another
plan,
wouldn't
the
court
have
the...
certainly
it
would
have
the
authority
to
disapprove
your
4-4-3...
or
your
latest
plan,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
it
loses
its
authority
just
because
the
attorney
general
comes
in
and
proposes
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
if
the
attorney
general
still
keeps
a
string
on
it
and
says,
we've
still
got
worries
about
the
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
late
insight
on
the
behalf
of
the
attorney
general?
if
the
court
had
just
approved
the
plan
as
submitted,
would
you
have
been
up
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
seem
to
be
agreeing
with
it;
not
just
entitled
to
respect.
you
think
it
is
now
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
reverse,
if
we
reversed
the
district
court
on
its
insistence
on
the
plurality,
would
there
be
anything
left
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least,
the
district
court
didn't
expressly
negative
any
purpose--
justice
byron
r.
white
--does
that
implicitly
negative
any
invidious
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
it
concerns
the
legality
of
the
form
of
government
of
the
city
of
port
arthur,
texas.
after
two
consolidations
and
–
and
annexation,
the
city
revised
its
form
of
government
and
submitted
the
new
system
to
the
attorney
general
for
preclearance
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
–
of
1965.
when
the
attorney
general
refused
the
–-
to
approve
the
plan,
the
city
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
seeking
a
judgment
that
the
revised
form
of
government
did
not
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
the
–-
on
the
ground
of
a
race.
while
the
suit
was
pending,
the
city
revised
its
city
government
again.
the
district
court
held
that
both
the
most
recent
revision
and
the
prior
one
were
--
were
adopted
for
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
and
hence
could
not
be
approved.
the
united
states
and
the
city
then
came
up
with
still
another
plan
and
submitted
it
to
the
court.
the
court
also
refused
to
approve
this
plan
but
indicated
that
the
result
would
be
different
if
the
city
would
eliminate
the
majority-vote
requirement
into
at
large
city
council
–-
councilmanic
districts.
the
city
didn't
like
that
result
and
appealed
here
and
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
for
the
reasons
that
we
give
and
the
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
do
not
think
the
district
court
exceeded
its
authority
under
the
voting
rights
–
under
the
voting
rights
act
and
conditioning
its
approval
upon
the
elimination
of
the
majority-vote
requirement.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
o'connor
joined.
