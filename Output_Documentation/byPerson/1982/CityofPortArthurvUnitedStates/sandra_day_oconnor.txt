justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
keith,
may
i
inquire
whether
you
think
that
the
standard
that
we
should
use
to
measure,
a
fair
reflection
of
political
strength
of
the
blacks
in
the
expanded
city,
should
be
measured
on
the
basis
of
voting
age
population
figures
or
on
general
population
figures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
haven't
really
determined
that,
have
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
anything
in
this
record
to
show
whether
the
general
population
statistics
are
a
good
indicator
of
future
voting
age
population
statistics?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
may
have
agreed
to
that,
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
tell
us
whether
there
is
some
correlation
on
future
voting
age
population.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
your
position
that
we
should
focus
entirely
on
voting
age
population
figures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
your
argument
rest
on
that
premise?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
keith,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
court
were
to
disagree
with
you
that
the
agreement
of
the
attorney
general
required
the
court
to
prove
the
plan.
let's
disregard
that
argument
for
a
moment.
then
is
it
still
your
position
that
the
court
as
a
matter
of
law
under
the
city
of
richmond
had
to
approve
the
plan
that
was
submitted?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why?
do
you
think
the
court
had
the
right
to
look
into
discriminatory
purpose?
did
the
court
have
the
right
to
look
beyond
the
effect
of
the
plan,
into
purpose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
all
we're
looking
at
is
that,
then
do
we
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
do
we
know
what
the
district
court
based
its
decision
on?
because
it
isn't
entirely
clear.
it
almost
reads
as
though
the
district
court
thought
it
was
reviewing
the
expansion,
when
it
refers
to
neutralizing
the
expansion.
and
theoretically,
you
would
determine
separately
whether
the
expansion
were
something
that
could
be
approved,
and
then
if
that
can
be
approved
you
would
determine
whether
the
voting
plan
could
be
approved.
is
there
some
confusion
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
notwithstanding
the
language
that
the
court
used,
that
there
was
no
confusion
about
what
the
court
was
doing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
also
whether
it's
your
position
that
the
court
should
look
only
at
voting
age
population
figures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
error
if
the
court
looks
only
at
voting
age
population
figures?
would
that
be
error?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wrong?
could
a
decision
stand
that
focuses
only
on
that?
