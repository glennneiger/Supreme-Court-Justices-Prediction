mr.
robert
q.
keith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
expanded
city
of
port
arthur,
texas,
constitutes
a
black
population
that
amounts
to
35
percent
of
the
voting
age
population.
this
expansion
occurred
through
a
popular
election
and
consolidation
with
two
adjoining
suburban
cities
and
the
subsequent
annexation
of
an
unincorporated
area
to
the
east
of
port
arthur.
because
of
the
expansion,
the
black
population
in
the
city
by
1980
census
standards
changed
from
a
45
percent
black
total
population
to
a
40
percent
black
total
population.
the
case
was
tried
to
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
on
an
election
plan
that
is
not
before
the
court.
it
was
tried
on
what
we
know
in
this
record
as
a
4-4-1
election
plan.
the
city
was
divided
into
four
single-member
districts
of
equal
size
and
a
representative
was
to
be
elected
from
each
of
those
districts.
then
there
was
an
at-large
representative
to
be
elected
from
each
of
those
four
districts.
so
there
were
four
single-member
representatives
and
four
at-large
representatives.
we
tried
the
case.
the
court
approved
the
expansion
of
the
boundaries
as
being
objectively
verifiable,
legitimate
in
purpose.
we
lost
the
case
on
the
question
of
the
4-4-1
plan,
there's
no
question
about
it.
when
the
district
court
opinion
was
rendered,
the
court
directed
the
city
to
detail
the
steps
that
it
would
take
to
address
the
issue.
the
city
went
to
the
united
states,
to
the
attorney
general,
and
hammered
out
an
agreed
election
plan.
the
parties
then
through
joint
submission
submitted
that
agreed
election
plan
to
the
district
court.
it
is
that
agreed
election
plan
that
is
before
your
honors
today.
in
this
record
we
call
that
plan
the
4-2-3
plan.
there
are
four
single-member
districts
of
equal
size.
there
are
then...
on
the
left
side
of
town,
the
two
single-member
districts
are
combined,
and
on
the
east
side
of
town
the
two
single-member
districts
are
combined
into
two
additional
single-member
districts.
thus
we
have
six
single-member
districts.
that's
four
plus
two.
then
there
are
three
at-large
representatives.
one
is
the
mayor,
who
may
reside
anywhere
in
the
community
and
be
elected
at
large,
and
that
is
not
in
dispute.
there
are
two
at-large
representatives,
one
of
whom
must
reside
on
the
east
and
one
of
whom
must
reside
on
the
west.
in
the
joint
submission
made
by
the
attorney
general
following
a
protracted
trial,
the
parties
stated
that
the
agreed
plan
provides
the
minority
population
with
representation
reasonably
equivalent
to
its
strength
in
the
expanded
city,
tracking
verbatim
richmond.
the
attorney
general
and
the
city
agreed
to
that.
turning
to
section
5
of
the
act,
there's
no
question
the
purpose
was
legitimate.
we
were
responding
to
a
directive
of
the
court,
and
we
worked
with
the
attorney
general.
there
is
no
question
that
the
effect
of
the
change
was
legitimate,
because,
as
the
attorney
general
stated
in
the
agreed
submission,
the
single-member
districts
in
the
city's
plan
would
appear
to
provide
the
minority
community
with
a
fair
opportunity
to
obtain
representation
reasonably
equivalent
to
their
political
strength
in
the
enlarged
community,
and
cited
richmond.
the
demographics
of
the
single-member
districts
are
such
that
one
district
has,
in
round
terms,
an
81
percent
black
population,
a
second
district
has
a
61
percent
black
population.
then
those
two
are
combined
into
a
third
single-member
district
that
has
a
71
percent
black
population.
these
facts
are
agreed
and
undisputed.
there
are
three
single-member
districts
that
have
a
majority
black
population.
there
are
three
single-member
districts
that
have
a
largely
white
population.
but
we
went
one
step
further
in
this
case
that
is
a
little
unusual.
the
attorney
general
and
the
parties,
the
city,
agreed
that
in
all
probability
representation
would
be
provided
equivalent
to
the
strength
of
the
minority
community.
the
court,
the
district
court
and
a
court
in
texas,
permitted
the
holding
of
elections
subsequent
to
disapproving
this
4-2-3
plan.
we
conducted
elections
in
the
six
single-member
districts
and
in
the
mayor's
race.
that's
before
your
honors
in
the
record.
in
those
elections
which
were
conducted
in
those
six
single-member
districts
there
were
three
black
citizens
elected
from
the
majority
black
districts
and
there
were
three
white
citizens
elected
from
the
majority
white
districts,
thus,
if
you
will,
proving
categorically
and
undisputedly
that
the
minority
community
received
representation
reasonably
equivalent
to
its
political
strength
in
the
expanded
community.
the
united
states
has
argued
very
vigorously
the
facts
of
the
case
as
if
the
original
plan
that
we
tried
was
before
your
honors.
the
district
court
disapproved
the
4-2-3
plan
notwithstanding
the
representation
and
agreement
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
city
of
port
arthur.
the
district
court
decision
was
two
to
one.
the
majority,
in
rejecting
the
plan,
stated
that
it
did
not
sufficiently
neutralize
the
effects
of
expansion
and
dilution.
that
was
the
conclusion.
there
were
no
reasons
given.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
your
honor,
in
footnote
22
of
the
rome
decision
the
court
stated,
respectfully,
a
preference
for
the
voting
age
population.
and
frequently
both
the
district
court
and
this
court
in
other
cases
have
spoken
of--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--i
think
that's
fair.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
the
attorney
general's
office
and
the
city
and
the
court
have
all
extrapolated
this
35
percent
number.
we
have
all
agreed
that
this
is
a
legitimate
number
and
a
preferable
number
if
we--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
we
have
accepted
it
as
the
best
number
available
to
the
census
bureau
and
to
the
parties.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
your
honor,
it
is
my
view
that
that
is
the
best
standard
if
it
is
a
legitimate,
demonstrable
number.
now,
it
is
not
always
available.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
not
at
all,
because
if
you
take
justice
marshall's
footnote
in
the
beer
case
and
do
the
mathematics...
and
these
become
mathematical
cases...
our
representation
of
33
percent
minority
representation
on
the
council
and
a
40
percent
population,
if
you
take
that
ratio,
that's
identical
to
that
which
he
suggested
was
appropriate
in
the
new
orleans...
in
the
beer
case
in
new
orleans.
so
we're
entirely
comfortable
with
the
40
percent
population,
or
we're
entirely
comfortable,
of
course,
with
the
35
percent
voting
age
population.
either
way,
the
position
of
the
court
is
the
same.
now,
your
honors,
in
addition
to
the
three
majority
black
seats,
there
is
a
representative
elected
at-large
from
a
district
consisting
of
71
percent
black
citizens.
and
as
justice
blackmun
said
in
concurrence
in
mobile,
the
residency
provides
additional
cross-sectional
view,
or
the
residency
requirement
provides
additional
cross-sectional
view.
furthermore,
in
addition
to
having
these
three
safe
seats,
if
you
will,
the
majority
community
also
has
a
full
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
election
of
the
two
at-large
representatives
and
the
mayor.
so
the
black
community
has
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
election
of
the
majority
of
the
council.
now--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--no,
sir,
we
do
not.
that's
not
in
the
record.
the
way
texas
records
are
kept,
it's
really
difficult.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
there's
no
question
but
what
the
city
of
port
arthur
met
the
richmond
standard,
and
unless
that
richmond
standard
is
to
be
be
replaced
by
a
new
rule
to
govern
this
and
future
section
5
cases,
then
the
court--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
those
were
the
two
at-large
seats
which
were
still
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
the
district
court
said
by
way
of
suggestion,
we
will
approve
your
plan
if
you
would
allow
the
at-large
representatives
by
plurality.
and
as
a
result,
your
honor,
there
was
no
election
conducted
in
those
two
at-large
seats.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
the
real
issue,
your
honor,
is
whether
or
not
the
legislative
plan
meets
the
test
of
richmond.
the
district
court's
suggestion
is
really
not
before
the
court.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
agreed
plan
submitted
by
the
city
of
port
arthur
and
approved
by
the
attorney
general
meets
the
richmond
test.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
the
district
court
ruled
two
to
one
that
it
did
not
and
that
we
should
go
one
more
step.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
only
because--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--it
didn't
say
because
of
the
plurality.
it
said
because
we
did
not
sufficiently
neutralize
the
dilution.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
united
states
then
says
that
because
of
your
history
of
polarized
voting
and
because
of
the
past
discrimination
which
they
argue,
thus
these
past
acts
go
to
infect
those
two
at-large
seats
with
the
majority
vote.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
your
honor.
it
was
presented
in
concert
with
the
attorney
general
and
responsive
to
the
court.
nobody
suggested
there's
an
impermissible
purpose.
we
thought
the
case
had
been
settled
when
we
received
this
rejection.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir,
by
reducing
the
black
population
from
45
to
40
percent
there
was
dilution,
because
there
was
a
history
of
polarized
voting
and
because
there
was,
by
the
court's
findings,
a
discriminatory
effect
in
the
past
at-large
elections.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
on
purpose
and
effect.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that's
correct.
but
most
of
the
opinion
was
related
to
effect.
now,
the
question
is,
the
district
court
tried
to
look
at
each
of
these
individual
parts
and
analyze
them,
and
the
united
states
tries
to
have
the
court
focus
on
each
individual
part
and
determine
whether
or
not
it,
standing
alone,
passes
muster.
in
fact,
as
this
court
has
insisted
and
as
other
courts
dealing
with
this
have
done,
you
look
at
the
entire
plan
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
has
the
effect.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir.
it
was
the
legislative
judgment
that
the
plurality
was
unacceptable.
your
honor,
since
that
time
and
pursuant
to
the
authority
of
the
district
court...
it's
outside
this
record,
but
it
is
entirely
verifiable...
that
plurality
issue
was
presented
to
a
vote
in
the
city
and
was
soundly
defeated,
three
and
a
half
to
one.
but
that
was
not
true
at
the
time
the
city
declined
to
accept
it.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir.
now,
this
is
very
clearly
a
legislative
plan.
as
late
as
april
of
this
year,
in
the
upham
v.
seman
case
out
of
texas,
your
honors
reiterated
the
deference
that
is
given
to
the
legislative
plan,
the
policy
reasons
that
support
it,
the
fact
that
neither
the
congress
nor
the
court
is
seeking
to
intrude
into
the
affairs
of
local
government.
the
attorney
general
approved
it
after,
by
this
record,
12
settlement
conferences
prior
to
trial,
detailed
depositions,
a
lengthy
trial,
briefs.
the
attorney
general
is
the
constituted
champion
of
a
minority
voter,
as
was
said
in
the
carey
case.
the
attorney
general
even
in
this
proceeding
has
acknowledged
that
the
court
could
properly
have
approved
the
4-2-3
plan.
it
is
the
position
of
the
city
that
the
richmond
standard
is
a
clear,
direct,
legitimately
predictable
standard
that
both
the
courts
and
parties
across
the
country
are
able
to
deal
with.
once
that
standard
is
met,
the
statute
is
complied
with
and
the
district
court
is
obligated
under
this
court's
decisions
to
approve
it.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
we
considered
that,
your
honor.
but
we
had
all
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
your
honor,
the
court
had
the
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
and
the
subject
matter,
there's
no
question
of
that.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
so
long
as
there
were
objectively
verifiable
facts
and
there
was
no
collusion
or
nothing
impermissible,
and
the
facts
undisputedly
met
the
test.
and
that
is
true
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
rule
52,
where
you've
got
clearly
erroneous
or
abuse
of
discretion.
as
a
matter
of
undisputed
facts,
the
governing
facts
are
established;
it
becomes
purely
a
question
of
law.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir,
we
did.
we
had
two...
we
had
four
persons
who
intervened
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
two
of
them
approved
the
4-2-3
plan,
two
of
them
objected
to
the
4-2-3.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
their
arguments
reach
the
level
of
a
proposition
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no
question
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
but
your
honor,
where
the
court
lost
its
authority
was
where
the
facts
become
undisputed
and
when
undisputedly
the
plan
meets
the
test
of
richmond.
the
attorney
general
also,
your
honor,
is
more
than
just
the
ordinary
litigant
in
a
voting
rights
proceeding.
he
under
the
act
has
a
standing
essentially
equivalent
to
that
of
a
court
in
the
administration
of
this
act.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
do
not
say
the
court--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
but
there's
no
suggestion
of
impermissible
purpose
here,
and
this
case
should
not
be
reversed
because
the
attorney
general
agreed.
this
case
should
be
reversed
because
the
plan
unequivocally
meets
a
clear,
direct
standard
established
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
your
honor,
because
the
facts
are
fixed
as
a
matter
of
law
and
then
the
question
of
whether
it
does
or
does
not
becomes
a
question
of
law
and
not
a
question
of
fact
or
discretion.
it
is
a
clear,
predictable
standard
and
the
parties
have
met
it.
the
attorney
general's
agreement
is
merely
further
evidence
of
that.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
your
honor,
there
has
not.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
there
is,
but
there's
no
suggestion
of
it
at
any
time
or
place.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
well,
your
honor--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--no,
sir.
and
the
court
made
no
finding
and
no
suggestion
that
the
purpose
was
impermissible.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
it
is
persuasive.
it
is
not
controlling.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct,
yes,
your
honor.
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
mr.
justice
stevens,
in
the
very
outset
of
the
district
court's
opinion,
they
said
on
page
4a
of
the
opinion:
"we
are
convinced
that
the
territorial
expansion
was
accomplished
without
a
discriminatory
purpose.
"
now,
they
did
cast
some
doubt
on
it,
but
they
clearly
came
out
on
page
1
with
an
unequivocal
finding
of
no
discriminatory
purpose.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
yes,
your
honor.
previously
the
city
had
annexed--
mr.
robert
q.
keith
--that
is
true.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
the
city
had
already
annexed
the
adjoining
black
territory.
there
was
no
more
black
community
to
be
annexed.
they
had
already
all
been
annexed.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
no,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.

that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
q.
keith
that
is
correct.
the
solicitor
general
states
that
the
residence
requirement
offers
nothing
to
the
black
citizen.
as
the
record
shows,
the
residency
requirement
was
imposed
as
a
condition
of
settlement
by
the
attorney
general,
and
it
seems
strange
that
they
would
now
say
it
offers
nothing
to
the
black
community
when
the
joint
submission
makes
very
plain
that
it
was
at
their
insistence
and
did
advance
the
interest
of
the
black
community.
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
beer.
your
honor,
before
these
annexations
began
there
was
one
black
representative
among
seven
on
the
council.
even
just
voting
on
a
partial
council,
there
are
now
three
black
representatives
out
of
nine.
so
if
beer
becomes
the
test,
we
have
met
beer
at
least
twice
over.
regardless
of
the
effect
of
the
swing
vote,
the
black
community
still
has
three
representatives
in
a
nine-person
council.
it
has
35
percent
of
the
voting
age
population.
the
richmond
standard
is
clear
and
direct
and
does
not
invoke
a
lot
of
confusion,
doubt,
and
subjective
judgments,
that
apparently
would
flow
from
an
affirmance
of
this
district
court
decision.
thank
you,
your
honors.
