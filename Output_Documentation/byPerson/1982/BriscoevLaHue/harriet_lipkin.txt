ms.
harriet
lipkin
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
argue
that
police
officers,
when
acting
as
witnesses,
are
entitled
to
only
a
qualified
immunity
from
liability
pursuant
to
42
usc
section
1983.
we
respectfully
submit
that
all
witnesses,
including
police
officers,
are
entitled
to
absolute
civil
immunity
for
their
testimony.
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
broad
language
contained
in
42
usc
section
1983
providing
a
remedy
to
individuals
deprived
of
rights
by
every
person
acting
under
color
of
law
was
not
intended
to
be
applied
as
stringently
as
it
reads.
this
court
has
developed
a
two-part
test
that
has
applied
when
a
government
official
has
claimed
entitlement
to
immunity
from
1983
liability.
first,
this
court
has
examined
the
common
law
history
of
the
claimed
absolute
immunity.
second,
this
court
has
balanced
competing
policy
considerations
in
order
to
determine
what
the
public
policy
is
best
served
by
continuing
this
grant
of
immunity
from
section
1983.
as
a
result
of
the
application
of
this
two-part
test,
this
court
has
granted
judges,
legislators
and
prosecutors
absolute
civil
immunity
because
these
individuals
were
granted
absolute
immunity
at
common
law,
and
because
public
policy
was
best
served
by
continuing
this
grant
of
immunity
in
the
1983
context.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
your
honor,
there
is
certainly
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
was
concerned
about
perjury
when
it
was--
ms.
harriet
lipkin
--yes,
there
was
evidence
of
that,
your
honor.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
however,
your
honor,
what
we
would
do
is
to
turn
to
an
analogous
situation.
there
is
also
substantial
legislative
history
indicating
that
the
42nd
congress
was
very
concerned
about
the
corruption
of
state
court
judges,
and
this
legislative
history
is
very
clearly
discussed
by
justice
douglas
in
his
dissenting
decision
in
pierson
v.
ray.
however,
although
this
legislative
history
was
there,
this
court
noted
that
immunities
well
grounded
in
history
and
reason
were
not
intended
to
be
abrogated
by
the
covert
language
contained
in
section
1983.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
your
honor,
i'm
saying
that
this
court
has
previously
stated
time
and
time
again
that
congress
never
intended
to
abolish
wholesale
all
common
law
immunities.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
certainly
this
court
has
discussed
some
common
law
immunities
it
has
not
adopted.
witnesses,
like
judges
and
prosecutor,
were
granted
absolute
civil
immunity
at
common
law.
for
example,
in
1772,
lord
mansfield
stated
the
proposition
that
neither
party,
witness,
counsel,
jury
or
judge
shall
be
put
to
answer
civilly
or
criminally
for
words
spoken
in
office.
most
american
courts
have
adopted
the
english
rule
of
absolute
witness
immunity,
tempered
with
the
requirement
that
the
witness'
statements
be
pertinent
and
relevant
to
the
court's
inquiry.
in
addition,
this
position
was
also
taken
by
professor
prosser
and
by
the
restatement
of
torts,
and
this
court
similarly
noted
in
imbler
v.
pachtman
that
witnesses
are
absolutely
privileged
for
words
spoken
during
the
course
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
public
policy
requires
that
all
witnesses,
including
police
officers,
be
granted
absolute
civil
immunity
for
their
testimony.
the
primary
reason
for
granting
witnesses
absolute
civil
immunity
is
the
concern
that
witnesses
will
be
intimidated
and
harassed
and
will
not
speak
freely
if
their
testimony
may
become
the
subject
of
future
civil
litigation.
in
addition,
the
courts
may
become
a
forum
for
vexacious
and
repetitive
litigation.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
oh,
no,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
but
it
is
our
position
that
congress
never
intended
to
abolish
the
common
law
history
of
absolute
witness
immunity.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
congress
never
intended
to
put
witnesses
on
trial
for
their
statements
made
during
the
course
of
a
judicial
proceeding,
that
congress
understood
that
there
were
ample
safeguards
to
encourage
a
witness
to
tell
the
truth.
for
example,
a
witness
was
subject
to
the
rigors
of
cross
examination,
were
subject
to
criminal
penalties
for
perjury--
ms.
harriet
lipkin
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
congress
was
concerned
about
many
things
when
it
enacted
the
civil
rights
act.
however,
of
course,
perjury
was
one
of
them,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
ever
intended
to
abolish
the
common
law,
absolute
witness
immunity
that
to
some
extent
has
been
carried
on
by
this
court
and
through
other
courts
in
its
language
consistently.
petitioners
argue
that
police
officers
are
entitled
to
only
a
qualified
immunity
for
their
testimony
pursuant
to
this
court's
ruling
in
pierson
v.
ray.
we
submit
that
this
argument
is
misguided
and
must
fail.
first,
it
must
be
noted
that
pierson
only
discussed
the
qualified
immunity
granted
to
police
officers
when
acting
as
arresting
officers.
this
court's
decision
in
pierson
was
based
upon
the
common
law
history
of
immunity
granted
to
arresting
officers
when
they
act
reasonably.
therefore,
petitioners'
argument
ignores
the
functional
analysis
that
this
court
has
applied
in
its
immunity
decisions.
it
is
the
function
of
a
1983
defendant,
rather
than
his
official
title,
that
will
determine
whether
he
is
to
be
granted
absolute
civil
immunity.
thus,
pursuant
to
this
court's
decision
in
pierson,
a
police
officer,
when
functioning
as
an
arresting
officer,
is
entitled
to
a
qualified
immunity,
and
we
would
assert
that
a
police
officer,
when
functioning
as
a
witness,
is
entitled
to
absolute
civil
immunity.
this
court
has
previously
noted
that
1983
defendants
may
be
granted
various
degrees
of
immunity,
depending
upon
the
specific
function
performed.
for
example,
a
prosecutor,
when
functioning
as
an
advocate
for
the
government,
has
been
granted
absolute
immunity
pursuant
to
this
court's
decision
in
imbler.
however,
this
court
has
also
noted
that
prosecutors
may
be
granted
only
a
qualified
immunity
when
functioning
as
administrators
or
as
investigative
officers.
there
are
also
special
policy
considerations
that
compel
this
court
to
grant
all
witnesses,
including
police
officers,
absolute
civil
immunity
for
their
testimony.
initially,
it
must
be
noted
that
if
police
officer
witnesses
are
not
granted
absolute
civil
immunity,
that
the
result
will
be
a
retrenchment
from
the
functional
analysis
that
this
court
has
applied
in
its
previous
immunity
decisions.
as
we
have
stated
previously,
it
is
the
function
of
the
1983
defendant
rather
than
his
official
title,
that
will
determine
whether
he
is
to
be
granted
absolute
civil
immunity.
thus,
in
the
case
of
the
police
officer
who
testifies,
he
acts
as
a
witness
because
in
a
courtroom
he
is
treated
like
any
other
witness.
in
addition,
if
police
officers
are
not
granted
absolute
civil
immunity
for
their
testimony,
there
will
be
a
virtual
retrial
of
the
criminal
offense
in
a
new
forum,
even
though
post-trial
relief
is
available.
such
suits
could
be
expected
with
great
frequency,
for
a
defendant
will
often
transform
his
resentment
at
being
prosecuted
into
a
claim
that
the
police
officer
had
submitted
perjured
testimony.
in
addition,
if
police
officers
are
not
granted
absolute
civil
immunity,
they
may
become
the
only
witnesses
not
granted
absolute
witness
immunity,
and
of
course,
the
american
courts
have
never
created
distinctions
between
witnesses.
in
the
alternative,
if
police
officers
are
granted
only
a
qualified
immunity
for
their
testimony,
the
result
may
be
an
extension
of
this
qualified
immunity
to
other
government
witnesses,
such
as
medical
examiners,
court-appointed
psychiatrists
or
county
surveyors.
in
any
event,
as
judge
wilke
observed
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
briggs
v.
goodwin,
if
the
principal
of
absolute
witness
immunity
is
rejected,
a
patchquilt
of
underlying
immunities
varying
from
witness
to
witness
and
subject
matter
to
subject
matter
will
result.
further,
a
ruling
that
police
officers
are
entitled
to
only
a
qualified
immunity
would
stand
in
a
way
to
ignore
the
special
features
of
the
judicial
system,
which
include
the
administration
of
an
oath,
the
availability
of
cross
examination
and
impeachment,
the
potential
for
criminal
penalties
for
perjury
and
post-trial
relief,
and
the
responsibility
of
a
trial
judge
to
exclude
inadmissible
and
inflammatory
testimony.
petitioners
suggest--
ms.
harriet
lipkin
--your
honor,
we
are
only
civil
attorneys.
we
are
not
criminal
attorneys.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
in
the
state
of
indiana,
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
petitioners
suggest
that
even
if
this
court
agrees
that
witnesses
are
entitled
to
absolute
civil
immunity,
that
police
officers
should
be
distinguished
and
granted
only
a
qualified
immunity
for
their
testimony.
we
respectfully
submit
that
petitioners'
argument
creates
artificial
and
irrelevant
distinctions
between
police
officer
witnesses
and
all
other
witnesses.
for
example,
petitioners
argue
that
police
officers
testify
regularly,
thereby
eliminating
the
concern
that
a
police
officer
may
be
intimidated
or
harassed.
however,
it
is
the
fear
that
a
witness'
testimony
may
become
the
subject
of
future
civil
litigation
that
creates
this
intimidation
or
harassment.
in
addition,
many
other
witnesses,
such
as
court-appointed
psychiatrists
or
medical
examiners,
also
testify
regularly.
petitioners
also
argue
that
police
officers
testify
with
a
badge
of
authority,
creating
a
likelihood
that
they
will
be
believed,
even
if
they
present
testimony
that
is
neither
true
nor
credible.
however,
many
other
witnesses,
such
as
physicians
or
psychologists,
also
testify
with
a
badge
of
authority
because
they
have
received
many
graduate
degrees
or
are
recognized
as
experts
in
their
field.
of
course,
it
is
the
responsibility
of
the
trier
of
fact
to
sift
through
conflicting
testimony
in
order
to
resolve
the
dispute
based
in
part
upon
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
regardless
of
whether
the
witness
is
a
government
witness
or
has
received
many
graduate
degrees.
petitioners
also
argue
that
a
qualified
immunity
will
not
place
an
undue
burden
upon
the
police
officer
witness
because
he
is
already
accustomed
to
civil
rights
liability
in
his
other
functions.
of
course,
this
argument
ignores
the
functional
analysis
that
we
discussed
previously.
in
addition,
petitioners
argue
that
civil
rights
claims
may
be
disposed
of
quickly
through
the
use
of
motions
to
dismiss
or
for
summary
judgment.
however,
where
the
good
faith
or
reasonableness
of
a
witness
is
in
question,
a
trial
will
probably
be
necessary
in
order
to
resolve
the
dispute.
in
addition,
a
qualified
immunity
could
create
civil
rights
liability
for
other
witnesses
allegedly
jointly
engaged
with
the
police
in
the
presentation
of
perjured
testimony.
we
would
also
like
to
note
that
the
thrust
of
petitioners'
argument
is
that
absolute
immunity
will
be
used
as
a
cloak
behind
which
the
clever
and
deceptive
witness
will
hide,
enabling
him
to
lie
without
fear
of
civil
liability.
however,
we
must
assume
that
the
vast
majority
of
all
police
officers
testify
honestly.
the
average,
honest
police
officer
must
be
granted
the
same
absolute
civil
immunity
granted
to
every
other
witness.
as
judge
learned
hand
observed
in
gregor
v.
biddle,
if
it
were
possible
in
practice
to
confine
such
complaints
to
the
guilty,
it
would
be
monstrous
to
deny
recovery,
because
it
is
not
possible
to
confine
such
complaints
to
the
guilty.
public
policy
and
the
effective
functioning
of
our
judicial
system
compels
that
police
officer
witnesses
be
granted
absolute
civil
immunity.
in
conclusion,
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
grant
all
witnesses,
including
police
officers,
absolute
civil
immunity
from
liability
pursuant
to
42
usc
section
1983.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
certainly,
justice
stevens.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
your
honor,
when
the
district
court
decided,
it
held
that
there
was
not
perjury.
it
also
held
that
this
would
not
be
actionable
because
witnesses
were
entitled
to
absolute
civil
immunity,
that
the
action
was
not
taken
under
color
of
law,
and
that
there
was
no
deprivation
of
rights.
petitioners
took
the
entire
case
up
on
appeal,
and
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
the
immunity
question,
finding
it
to
be
paramount,
and
did
not
reach
the
other
issues.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
no,
your
honor,
because
in
either
way--
ms.
harriet
lipkin
--well,
your
honor,
in
either
way,
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
a
trial
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
resolve
the
dispute.
in
addition,
there
would
be
the
constant
dread
of
retaliation
that
justice
learned
hand
talked
about.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
your
honor,
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is,
obviously,
to
have
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
but
in
addition,
we
would
suggest
that
absolute
witness
immunity
is
necessary
because
police
officers
should
be
treated
as
any
other
witness
and
granted
absolute
witness
immunity.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
harriet
lipkin
thank
you.
