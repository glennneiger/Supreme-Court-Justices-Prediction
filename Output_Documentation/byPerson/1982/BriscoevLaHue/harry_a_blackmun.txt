mr.
moran,
i
am
a
little
puzzled
by
your
emphasis
of
these
witnesses
as
police
officers.
they
are
not
asserting
their
immunity
because
they
are
police;
they
are
asserting
it
because
they
are
witnesses.
isn't
that
a
different
approach?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
moran,
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
reach
the
under-color-of-state-law
issue,
did
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
that
in
1871
the
congress
meant
to
punish
perjurers
when
it
passed
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
was
a
lot
of
evidence,
wasn't
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
just
some,
there
was
a
lot.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you're
saying
that
the
ku
klux
klan
act
does
not
mean
what
it
says
or
what
its
legislative
history
indicates.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
you're
saying
that
even
in
1872,
a
perjurer
was
not
covered
by
1983.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
with
respect
to
perjury
in
a
case
arising
in
1872?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
all
of
this...
all
of
this
legislative
history
about
concern
about
perjurers
is
down
the
drain;
the
congress
really
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
has
your
legal
department
ever
prosecuted
a
policeman
for
perjury?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
have
you...
do
you
know
of
anyone
that
has
ever
been
prosecuted
in
the
state
of
indiana?
