justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there,
mr.
moran?
how
could
an
officer
who
committed
perjury
ever
discharge
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
did
so
in
good
faith?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
good
faith--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
it
wouldn't
be
perjury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
are
really
saying
that
there
is
no
defense
to
a
complaint
against
a
police
officer
that
he
committed
perjury
at
a
trial
with
regard
to
a
relevant
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
there...
when
you
say
there
should
be
no
absolute
immunity,
you
really
are
also
saying
there
should
be
no
immunity,
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
moran,
may
i
interrupt
you
on
this...
on
that
point?
it
is
critical
to
your
case
that
the
perjury
be
a
constitutional
violation,
as
i
understand
your
presentation,
and
as
i
understand
the
constitutional
rule,
mere
perjury
isn't
a
constitutional
violation;
it's
the
knowing
use
of
perjured
testimony.
does
that
not
require
you
to
prove
that
the
prosecutor
was
a
party
to
the
perjury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
prosecutor
did
not
know
of
the
alleged
perjury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
that
mean
that
every
criminal
conviction
in
which
the
defendant
could
later
demonstrate
that
there
was
some
perjury
committed
by
some
state
representative,
is
subject
to
collateral
attack?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
on
the
record
before
us
that
in
any
case
there
is
a
showing
of
perjury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
you
really
need
the
absolute
immunity
defense
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
only
in
the
case
where
there
really
is
perjury
that
you
need
the
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
there
is
a
prima
facie
showing
of
perjury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
not
in
this
particular
case.
i
mean,
the
fingerprint
witness,
pretty
clear
he
didn't
perjure
himself,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
on
the
record
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
a
person
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime
in
a
state
court
may
recover
damages
under
the
federal
civil
rights
acts
from
a
police
officer
who
is
alleged
to
have
given
false
testimony
at
the
criminal
trial.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
concluded
that
a
police
officer
was
entitled
to
the
same
immunity
from
liability
as
a
lay
witness.
and
that
such
a
damage
action
against
an
officer
may
not
be
maintained.
although
this
conclusion
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
in
most
courts
that
have
addressed
the
issue,
a
contrary
opinion
has
also
been
expressed.
in
view
of
the
importance
of
the
question,
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
it.
as
we
explain
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
with
the
majority
view
and
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
brennan,
justice
marshall,
and
justice
blackmun
have
filed
dissenting
opinions.
