even
if
it
barred
an
action
for
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
that's
quite...
that's
pretty
generally
true
about
judicially-created
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
our
cases
here
indicate
that
congress
didn't
really
intend
to
nullify
at
least
some
of
the
common
law
immunities--
justice
byron
r.
white
--including
some
absolute
immunities.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
that?
what's
the
rule
of
common
law
about
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
we've
held
that...
we've
held
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
nullify
the
kind
of...
those
kinds
of
immunities.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
because
there's
no
state
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
because
of
absolute
immunity?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
moran,
on
the
state
action
point,
aren't
you...
to
make
it
state
action,
aren't
you
really
required
to
say
that
his
telling
a
lie
knowingly
was
state
action?
it
may
be...
the
state
certainly
isn't...
the
policy
of
the
state
certainly
isn't
to
have
police
officers
get
on
the...
to
get
on
the
stand
and
perjure
themselves,
and
if
he
did
it,
he
did
it
on
his
own.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
think
there
is
no
case
in
our,
on
the
books
that
indicates
that
you...
that
you...
that
something
that,
an
official
acting
contrary
to
policy
is
outside
the
realm
of
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
which...
and
if
they
would
have
come
out
that
way,
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
way
the
district
court
ruled.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
the
outset
of
the
case
have
the
complaint
dismissed
if
what
it
claims
is
liability
for
perjury.
