justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
it's
a
non-official,
he's
not
a
police
officer,
he's
not
a
state
official.
it
is
a
criminal
prosecution
prosecuted
by
the
state,
and
a
lay
witness,
let's
call
it,
perjures
himself.
would
you
have
a
1983
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
he's
not.
this
is...
he
on
his
own
perjures
himself
and
later
it
is
discovered
that
he
has,
and
the
convicted
defendant
brings
a
1983
suit,
could
he
maintain
it,
just
against
the
lay
witness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
moran,
the...
at
common
law,
in
the
hypothetical
i
put
to
you,
the
lay
witness,
i
take
it,
would
have
had
an
absolute
immunity,
would
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
i
gather
the
burden
of
your
position
is
that
1983,
where
the
perjurious
witness
is
a
police
officer,
gives
you
a
cause
of
action
against
the
police
officer
who
has
no
immunity
because
congress,
when
it
enacted
1983
in
1971,
intended
that
1983
should
provide
such
a
cause
of
action
without
the
officer
having
any
immunity,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather,
going...
when
you
got
the
civil
action
under
1983
against
the
police
officer,
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
prove
only
that
the
officer
perjured
himself,
and
the
officer
would
have
no
defense
whatever
except
that
i
did
not
perjure
myself,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
isn't
my
purpose...
that
he
did
not
perjure
himself.
he
would
have
no
other
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
moran,
suppose
his
defense
was
that
the
events
which...
about
which
he
testified
falsely
occurred
when
he
was
off
duty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
his
defense
was
the
events
about
which
i
testified
falsely
all
happened
while
i
was
off
duty?
and
the
testimony
was
given
when
he
was
off
duty.
may
i
add
that
in
as
a
factor?
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
any?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
81-1404,
briscoe
versus
lahue
will
be
delivered
by
justice
stevens.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
justice
stevens.
