--wait
a
minute.
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
supposing
there's
a
prosecution
of
a
criminal
defendant
in
rock
island,
illinois
and
a
police
officer
from
davenport
comes
over...
davenport,
iowa,
comes
over
and
testifies.
now,
is
that
police
officer
from
iowa
testifying
in
the
illinois
proceeding
treated
as
a
government
witness
from
your
point
of
view?
it
only
would
have
to
be
shown
that
he
perjured
himself
and
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
didn't
know
about
it?
