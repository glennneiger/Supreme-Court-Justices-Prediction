mr.
moran,
might
he
have
a
defense
that
he
didn't
act
under
color
of
state
law
because
of
our
decision
in
polk
county
v.
dodson?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
doesn't
every
citizen
have
a
duty
to
come
forward
to
testify
when
required
to
do
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
public
defenders
have
a
duty
to
come
forward
into
court
and
defend
the
defendants
whom
they
are
appointed
to
represent,
but
the
court
didn't
find
that
that
made
it
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
