mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
cases
were
brought
pursuant
to
title
42
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1983.
the
precise
issue
that
is
being
presented
to
this
court
for
decision
is
whether
a
police
officer
who
commits
perjury
during
a
state
court
criminal
trial
should
be
granted
absolute
immunity
from
civil
liability
under
title
42,
united
states
code,
section
1983.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioners
that
such
absolute
immunity
should
not
be
extended
to
police
officers
who
have
perjured
themselves
during
state
court
criminal
trials,
and
that
there
are
four
fundamental
reasons
why
such
absolute
immunity
should
not
be
extended
to
police
officers.
the
first
of
these
reasons
is
that
qualified
good
faith
immunity
as
opposed
to
absolute
immunity
has
generally
been
observed
by
this
court
to
be
the
predominant
standard
in
civil
rights
actions
where
immunity
questions
are
raised.
the
court
has
recognized
that
qualified
good
faith
immunity
gives
an
opportunity
to
a
civil
rights
defendant
to
defend
the
case,
but
at
the
same
time,
gives
the
civil
rights
plaintiff
an
opportunity
to
attempt
to
make
a
case
out
of
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
the
court
has
recognize
that
the
qualified
good
faith
immunity
does
apply
to
police
officers.
secondly--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
he
can
if,
indeed,
it
has
been
shown
that
he
committed
perjury.
in
other
words,
justice
stevens--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--i
do
not
think
that
if
there
is
conclusive
proof
of
perjury,
that
it
could
ever
be
assumed
that
it
was
given
in
good
faith.
i
think
the
only
significance
that
qualified
good
faith
immunity
has
in
this
context
would
be
where
the
police
officer
would
be
allowed
to
offer
evidence
in
response
to
the
charges
that
he
believed
the
statements
he
made
at
the
criminal
trial
for
the
truth.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
and
that
would
not
be
perjury.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
true
to
the
extent
that
good
faith
is
not
consistent
with
perjury.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
in
a
sense,
yes,
except
that
a
few
courts
that
have
viewed
the
situation
have
considered
that
perhaps
there
would
be
what
they
have
characterized
as
a
qualified
good
faith
immunity
in
the
sense
that
the
police
officer
would
be
allowed
to
come
forward
with
evidence
to
show
that
he
believed
the
statements
to
be
true.
but
i
essentially
agree
with
your
position.
i
don't
think...
i
think
the
two
are
essentially
mutually
inconsistent.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
the
second--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
it
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
excuse
me?
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
the
parties
have
consistently
taken
the
position
that
there
would
be
an
action
present
under
title
18
usc
section
242.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
the
petitioners'
position
on
that
point,
your
honor,
is
of
course
that
section
1983
was
passed
with
the
very
idea
that
there
would
be
a
civil
damages
remedy
for
a
constitutional
violation,
and
as
the
petitioners
have
attempted
to
show
in
their
briefs,
there
are
indications
from
studies
that
have
been
conducted
with
respect
to
criminal
prosecutions
under
18
usc
242
that
there
may
not
be
in
effect
any
true
deterrent
effect
as
a
result
of
that,
so
that
the
recognized
benefit
attendant
to
section
1983
actions,
that
there
might
be
a
deterrent
effect
through
the
bringing
of
those
actions,
would
be
enhanced
by
a
finding
by
the
court
that
they
could
be
brought.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
well,
that's--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--that
the
cases
have
found--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--the
rule,
as
i
perceive
the
court's
cases
with
respect
to
absolute
immunity,
has
revolved
around
the
observation
that
immunities
in
general
are
accorded
to
government
officials
who
are
sued
under
1983
when
the
level
of
their
discretion
is
so
high
that
their
day-to-day
activities
can
be
characterized
as
decision-making,
indeed,
that
almost
everything
they
do
involves
a
decision.
this
court
has
granted
immunity
to
judges,
to
prosecutors,
to
legislators,
as
the
chief
judge
pointed
out,
to
administrative
law
judges
and
the
president.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
that's
true,
but
there
are
two
observations
that
are
critical
to
this
case
that
relates
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
court
has
held
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
nullify
an
immunity
if
the
legislative
history
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act
were
silent
on
that
point.
the
petitioners
have
taken
the
position
that
the
42nd
congress
was
not
silent
on
the
point
of
whether
it
considered
perjury
an
act
that
should
be
condemned
and
should
be
actionable
under
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
indeed,
there
are
many
comments
throughout
the
legislative
history
to
the
effect
that
perjury
was
to
be
condemned,
and
that
it
indeed
would
be
actionable
under
section
1983.
furthermore,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
immunities
not
being
automatically
eliminated
as
a
result
of
the
passage
of
the
act,
the
court's
recent
pronouncements
have
indicated
clearly
that
a
simple
recognition
of
the
fact
that
a
common
law
immunity
existed
does
not
end
the
inquiry,
but
that
the
court
will
consider
the
history
of
the
particular
immunity
suggested
and
determine
under
modern
day
policy
reasons
whether
that
immunity
should
apply
equally
in
the
civil
rights
context
as
it
would
in
the
common
law
context,
as
it
has
been
previous
to
the
passage
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
i
would
think
that
the
most
significant
reason
why
there
should
be
a
special
rule
underlies
the
passage
of
the
1871
civil
rights
act,
which
was,
i
would
suggest,
the
policy
of
congress
finding
that
in
creating
a
new
tort
under
section
1983,
there
was
in
effect
a
much
more
serious
aspect
to
that
kind
of
a
tort,
and
that
the
aspect
that
was
so
serious
was
that
the
tort
was
rendered
by
a
governmental
agent
who
was
found
to
have
had
power
that
could
not
be
wielded
by
the
average
person
who
might
consider
a
common,
or
might
perpetrate
a
common
law
tort.
in
that
particular
instance,
the
congress
showed
that
it
wanted
to
provide
a
damages
remedy
to
a
victim
of
governmental
overreaching.
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
monroe
v.
pape,
there
was
an
explicit
recognition
by
justice
harlan
to
the
effect
that
section
1983
was
significant
in
its
effort
to
recognize
that
a
constitutional
tort
was
more
significant
than
a
common
law
tort.
there
justice
harlan
said,
"the
statute
becomes
more
than
a.
"
judicial...
"jurisdictional
provision
only
if
one
attributes
to
the
enacting
legislature
the
view
that
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right
is
significantly
different
from
and
more
serious
than
a
violation
of
a
state
right
and
therefore
deserves
a
different
remedy
even
though
the
same
act
may
constitute
both
a
state
tort
and
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
act.
"
"this
view,
by
no
means
unrealistic
as
a
common-sense
matter
is,
i
believe,
more
consistent
with
the
flavor
of
the
legislative
history
than
is
a
view
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
grant
a
lower
court
forum
for
fact
findings.
"
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
reason
that
there
can
be
and
should
be
a
special
exception
in
this
area
relates
to
the
fact
that
the
42nd
congress
considered
a
tort
committed
by
a
governmental
agent
to
be,
indeed,
a
very
serious
situation
that
should
be
actionable
even
though
it
might
not
have
been
actionable
under
common
law.
the
question
of
immunities
that
have
been
raised
in
the
context
of
constitutional
or
civil
rights
litigation
has
been
addressed
several
times
by
the
court
in
the
last
seven
to
eight
years.
in
doing
so,
the
court
seems
to
have
taken
the
direction
that
absolute
immunity
will
be
considered
to
be
the
exception
to
the
rule,
and
that
qualified
good
faith
immunity
would
be
the
predominant
standard.
in
butz
v.
economou,
the
court
was
asked
to
decide
the
specific
question
of
whether
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
could
sue
a
cabinet-level
officer
for
an
alleged
defamation.
he
brought
the
action
under
a
bivens
type
action
and
asserted
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
bring
an
action
against
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
the
secretary
of
the
agriculture
brought
to
this
court's
attention
two
prior
decisions
rendered
by
it,
spalding
v.
vilas
and
barr
v.
matteo.
both
of
those
actions
were
essentially
common
law
defamation
actions
which
eventually
resulted
in
decisions
by
this
court
to
the
effect
that
the
defendants
in
those
cases
were
absolutely
immune
from
damages
in
a
common
law
action.
when
this
court
was
asked
to
extend
the
holding
in
barr
and
spalding
to
the
constitutional
tort
context
in
butz
v.
economou,
the
court
refused
to
do
that
and
specifically
indicated
that
if
there
was
a
common
law
immunity
for
the
common
law
action
of
defamation,
that
immunity
would
not
be
extended
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
the
constitutional
tort
context,
and
the
court
upheld
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
to
bring
that
action.
thus,
we
have
seen
that
there
was
specifically
a
contraction
of
immunities
that
were
observed
in
common
law
but
were
considered...
but
that
the
court
considered
it
necessary
to
contract
the
scope
of
those
immunities
in
the
constitutional
tort
context.
the
court
has
extended
absolute
immunity
that
was
found
in
common
law,
in
many
instances
in
ages-old
common
law
immunity
situations.
it
has
extended
it
to
judges
in
pierson
v.
ray,
to
administrative
law
judges
in
butz
v.
economou,
to
prosecutors
in
imbler
v.
pachtman,
to
legislators
in
tenney
v.
brandhove,
and
to
the
president
in
nixon
v.
fitzgerald.
however,
the
common
thread
through
all
of
those
decisions
has
been
that
if
absolute
immunity
were
not
extended
to
the
people
who
performed
the
functions
attendant
to
those
offices,
indeed,
the
very
functioning
of
the
government
insofar
as
it
was
embodied
in
the
activities
inherent
in
those
offices,
might
be
paralyzed,
the
basic
idea
being
that
if
a
person
were
deterred
from
going
ahead
and
making
significant
decisions
through
intimidation
or
harassment
that
might
be
attendant
to
a
possible
lawsuit
brought
against
them
for
conducting
those
activities
that
an
immunity,
an
absolute
immunity
should
attach
to
those
activities.
it
has
been
the
petitioners'
contention
throughout
this
lawsuit
that
there
is
no
decisionmaking
involved
in
testifying
in
a
judicial
proceeding,
and
that
there,
in
fact,
is
no
discretion
in
any
material
sense
involved
in
testifying
in
that
a
witness
is
required
to
testify
completely
and
truthfully
to
questions
that
are
put
to
him
during
the
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
that
is
true.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
that
has
always
been
considered
to
be
a
countervailing
factor
with
respect
to
civil
rights
lawsuits.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
but
the
court
has
continued
to
recognize
that
even
though
there
is,
in
essence,
a
down
side
to
allowing
civil
rights
plaintiffs
to
bring
civil
rights
lawsuits
against
governmental
agents,
even
in
recognition
of
a
detraction,
so
to
speak,
from
the
performance
of
their
normal
duties
will
be
allowed
so
that
the
purposes
behind
section
1983
will
be
advanced,
and
that
a
person
who
is
a
victim
of
constitutional
violations
can
gain
compensation
for
that
act.
and
indeed,
in
the
case
of
police
officers,
which
is
being
presented
to
this
court
now,
in
both
monroe
v.
pape
and
pierson
v.
ray,
the
court
said
that
police
officers
would
be
held
to
only
be
qualifiably
immune
from
civil
rights
actions
for
nearly
everything
that
they
had
to
do
during
the
course
of
their
duties.
it
would
be
the
petitioners'
contention
that
testifying
by
police
officers
is
simply
another
one
of
their
duties
and
that,
indeed,
although
they
might
be
interrupted
from
their
duties
and
might
be
forced
to
come
to
court
and
defend
their
actions
in
such
a
lawsuit,
this
would
be
just
considered
the
cost
of
going
ahead
and
allowing
a
civil
rights
plaintiff
to
bring
a
proper
1983
action.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor,
they
are
asserting
it
because
they
are
witnesses,
and
i
think
that
it
is
the
only
way
that
they
can
approach
the
situation
from
the
standpoint
that,
as
the
court
has
indicated
recently,
the
functional
aspect
of
an
analysis
on
this
point
is
significant.
however,
it's
also
important
to
recognize
that
if
the
questioned
activity
is
a
constitutional
violation
and
that
it
is
performed
under
the
color
of
state
law,
that
it
then
will
be
actionable
under
1983.
it's
been
the
petitioners'
contention
that
this
activity,
even
when
characterized
as
being
giving
testimony
during
judicial
proceedings,
is
given
under
the
color
of
state
law.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
it
is
our
petition
that
it
would
not
so
require,
justice
stevens.
of
course,
under
this
court's
holding,
first
in
mooney
v.
hollahan,
and
later
in
nappew
v.
illinois
and
giglio
v.
united
states,
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
that
the
knowing
use
of
perjured
testimony
by
government
prosecutors
will
result
in
a
due
process
violation.
however,
the
petitioners
would
take
the
position
that
the
general
holding
in
those
cases
applies
equally
to
the
present
cases.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
yes,
and
the
reason
that
the
petitioners
have
taken
that
position
consistently
is
that
there
is
a
knowing
use
by
the
state
of
perjured
testimony
when
the
perjuring
witness
is
a
representative
of
the
state.
in
other
words,
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
only
a
logical
extension
of
the
holdings
of
the
court
in,
for
instance,
nappew
v.
illinois.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
i
don't
think
i
could
respond
in
blanket
fashion
to
that
question.
i
think
it
would
depend
on
a
case-by-case
analysis.
i
think
there
is
the
potential
for
that,
but
i
still
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
examine
the
particular
facts
relating
to
the
state
witness
that
would
be...
who
would
have
perjured
himself
or
herself
and
would
be
in
question.
i
certainly
have
taken
the
position
that
that
would
be
true
if
the
state
witness
is
a
police
officer
and
has
met
the
other
conditions
that
we
have
suggested
would
be
necessary
to
meet
the
under--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--against
the
lay
witness,
your
honor?
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
the
only
time
that
there
might
be
the
potential
for
a
1983
suit
against
a
lay
witness
would
be
if
there
were
allegations
of
conspiracy
with
government
officials.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
assuming
that
the...
there
was
no
showing
of
any
state
action--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--with
respect
to
the...
no.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
the
easy
answer
is
that
there's
no
state
action.
that's
the
threshold
answer.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
the
question
of
no
state
action
obviously
would
perhaps
remain,
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
presented
to
the
court
in
the
section
1983
context.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
under
section
1983,
yes,
and
assuming
non-involvement
with
any
state
officials,
yes.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
i
believe
that
would
be
true,
your
honor.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
that
would
be
our
position,
your
honor,
that
specific
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
condemnation
that
congress
thought
should
be
brought
against
perjury
in
state
court
judicial
proceedings,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
legislative
history
would
suggest
that
there
would
not
be
absolute
immunity
for
perjury.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
statement.
he
clearly
would
have
the
defense
that
he
could
offer
evidence
that
indeed
his
statement
was
not
false,
and
at
least
not
intentionally
false--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--none
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
under
the
decision
of
polk
county
v.
dodson
that
he
would
have
a
defense
as
to
that
point.
i
think
he
might
have
a
defense
that
he
was
not
acting
under
color
of
state
law
under
certain
circumstances.
we
have
posited
that
certain
requirements
beyond
a
simple
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
police
officer
who
was
testifying,
would
have
to
be
met
to
show
that
his
testimony
was
given
under
the
color
of
state
law,
such
things
as
that
he
was
called
by
the
state,
that
the
evidence
that
he
was
giving
was
supporting
the
prosecution,
that
it
was
his
duty
to
come
forward
and
to
give
testimony.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
if
a
subpoena
has
been
served
on
any
citizen,
yes,
he
would
be
required
to
respond
to
the
subpoena,
but
the
question
of
the
word
"duty"
takes
on
particular
significance
with
respect
to
a
police
officer.
it
has
been
the
petitioners'
position
consistently
that
in
the
case
of
police
officers,
it
is
a
duty
in
the
sense
of
a
job
responsibility,
that
routinely
and
systematically
the
police
officers
have
to
come
to
court
in
order
to
testify
as
to
the
results
of
their
investigatory
activities.
it
is
in
that
sense
that
it
is
a
duty
of
the
police
officer
to
respond--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
in
the
decision
in
polk
county
v.
dodson,
the
court
recognized
the
basic
nature
behind
the
public
defender's
duties
as
being,
not
so
much
residing
in
the
fact
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
state
or
an
employee
of
the
state
or
county,
that
the
traditional
lawyer-client
relationship
is
the
predominant
standard
by
which
a
public
defender's
actions
would
be
determined.
thus,
you
have
a
very
different
qualitative
situation
in
the
relationship
between
activities
of
the
public
defender
representing
an
indigent
criminal
defendant
and
a
police
officer
who
does
not
have
any
direct
fiduciary
relationship
with
a
criminal
defendant
but
indeed
is
trying
to
procure
a
conviction
against
him.
that's
a
direct
adversary
relationship
rather
than
a
fiduciary
relationship.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
excuse
me,
justice
brennan.
suppose--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--well,
that
certainly
throws
a
couple
of
balls
up
in
the
air
that
i
don't
think
we
have
in
hand
in
this
case.
it
might
call
for...
it
certainly
would
call
for
re-examination
of
the
position
that
the
petitioners
have
taken
in
this
case
because
we
have
asserted
that
those
missing
elements
are
present
in
this
case.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
i
would
think
that
he
would
be
treated
the
same
way,
justice
rehnquist,
if
the
other
preconditions
were
shown,
that
indeed
his
testimony
was
the
result
of
cooperation
with
the
prosecution
in
an
attempt
to
forward
the
efforts
to
procure
a
conviction,
an
that
they
were
given
as
part
of
his
job
responsibilities
or
duties.
so
i
would
not
see
a
distinction
between
those
two
situations.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
of
course,
that--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--the
way
i
would
respond
to
your
question,
justice
white,
is
this.
inherent
in
section
1983
litigation
is
the
observation
that
an
actionable
activity
was
not
authorized--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--specifically
by
the
state,
and
that
there
is
a
departure
between
actual
authority
and
perhaps
apparent
authority
which
has
been
abused,
but
the
court
has
consistently
held
that
an
abuse
of
apparent
authority
that
is
vested
by
the
state
is
actionable
under
section
1983.
of
course,
petitioners
aren't
suggesting
that
the
state
is
encouraging
perjury.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
yes,
he
does,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--yes,
that's
true.
the--
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
--that
is
true,
but
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
as
to
the
paradox
presented
by
that
situation
is
given
by
this
court's
decision
in
dennis
v.
sparks
where
a
state
court
judge
was
said
to
have
corruptly
conspired
with
parties
during
a
state
court
judicial
proceeding
in
order
to
obtain
an
injunction
against
the
later
civil
rights
plaintiff.
when
that
plaintiff
brought
the
civil
rights
action,
the
parties,
the
private
parties
who
were
said
to
have
conspired
with
the
state
court
judge,
then
said
that
they
should
be
immune
because
the
judge
was
immune,
and
that
there
should
in
fact
be
derivative
immunity
granted
to
them
through
the
judge,
this
court
explicitly
recognized
that
the
state
court
judge
indeed
was
immune
under
pierson
v.
ray,
but
said
that
that
did
not
close
the
question,
and
that
indeed
the
parties
who
were
said
to
have
corruptly
conspired
with
the
judge
could
be
sued
under
1983.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
your
honor,
in
footnote
4
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
court
addressed
the
under-color-of-law
question
and
expressed
an
opinion
that
if
they
were
to
go
ahead
and
decide
that
issue
directly
on
the
merits,
that
they
would
find
that
such
an
argument,
that
the
testimony
wasn't
given
under
the
color
of
state
law,
would
not
call
for
a
dismissal
of
the
case,
and
they
said
that
if
evidence
could
be
adduced
to
the
affect
that
it
was
part
of
the
duties
of
a
police
officer
to
testify,
that
the
under-color-of-law
requirement
would
be
met.
they
did
not
make...
they
offered
that
almost
in
an
advisory
capacity,
but
they
said
they
were
not
required
to
specifically
reach
that
decision
because
of
their
finding
on
the
immunity
question.
mr.
edmund
b.
moran,
jr.
yes,
it
would
have
been
contrary.
