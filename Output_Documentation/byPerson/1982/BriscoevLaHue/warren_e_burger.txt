we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
briscoe
against
lahue.
mr.
moran,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
nothing
very
new
about
there
being
no
remedy
for
something
of
this
kind
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
which
of
course
is
express.
a
member
of
the
congress
may
make
any
statement
he
wants,
false
or
whatever,
and
he
is
wholly
immune,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
makes
it
within
the
framework
of
our
interpretation
of
the
clause.
the
absolute
immunity
position
under
1981,
wouldn't
bar
criminal
prosecution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
suggest
a
reason
why
there
should
be
a
special
rule
for
civil
rights
cases
with
respect
to
this
very
narrow
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
all
of
the
absolute
immunity
cases,
isn't
the
basic
idea
that
the
particular
person
should
be
relieved
even
from
the
burden
of
defending
the
lawsuits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
they
can
be
harassed
to
the
detriment
of
the
performance
of
their
duties
simply
by
lawsuits,
even
if
they
win
the
lawsuits.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
a
paradox
in
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
might
be
shown
in
such
a
case
to
have
induced
and
planned
all
of
this
perjured
testimony,
and
then
the
policeman
takes
the
stand
and
testifies
falsely
pursuant
to
that
arrangement,
the
prosecutor
has
absolute
immunity,
does
he
not,
civil
immunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
could
be
criminally
prosecuted,
removed
from
office
and
a
lot
of
other
things,
couldn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
cannot
be
sued
civilly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
ms.
lipkin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
merely
the
claim,
the
claim
that
perjury
was
committed
invokes
automatically
the
witness
privilege,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
your
theory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in.
