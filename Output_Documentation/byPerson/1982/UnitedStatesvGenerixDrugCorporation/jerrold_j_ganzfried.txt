mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
an
important
question
under
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
that
will
have
a
profound
effect
on
the
public
health.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
permits
the
sale
without
fda
approval
of
a
large
category
of
prescription
medicines
known
as
generic
drugs.
such
products
purport
to
be
interchangeable
with
preexisting
or
pioneer
drugs
for
treating
serious
and
life-threatening
diseases,
but
they
are
not
identical
to
the
pioneers
and
they
may
in
fact
be
unsafe
and
ineffective.
by
way
of
background,
i
should
explain
that
drugs
are
composed
active
ingredients,
which
are
intended
to
have
a
therapeutic
effect
on
the
patient,
and
inactive
ingredients,
which
are
not
intended
to
have
a
therapeutic
effect.
the
inactive
ingredients,
however,
play
an
important
role.
they
may
comprise
90
to
99
percent
of
a
product
and
they
often
have
a
significant
impact
on
how
the
active
ingredient
does
its
job.
for
example,
the
inactive
ingredients
influence
how
much
active
ingredient
reaches
the
bloodstream
and
how
quickly
this
occurs.
so
even
if
two
drugs
have
the
same
active
ingredient,
we
cannot
assume
that
they
will
have
the
same
results.
the
inactive
ingredients
may
slow
down
or
block
the
action
of
the
active
ingredient
altogether,
so
it's
as
if
the
patient
took
no
medication
at
all.
for
a
patient
who's
taking
a
drug
to
control
high
blood
pressure,
such
as
most
of
the
drugs
involved
in
this
case
were,
this
means
he
runs
the
risk
of
heart
attach
or
stroke.
on
the
other
hand,
the
inactive
ingredients
can
speed
up
or
increase
the
effect
of
the
active
ingredient,
and
this
is
perhaps
most
apparent
in
time
release
drugs,
where
the
result
can
be
a
dumping
of
active
ingredients
too
quickly
into
the
bloodstream,
causing
toxicity,
overdose
and
other
adverse
side
effects.
it's
as
if
in
that
case
the
patient
has
taken
two
or
three
or
ten
times
the
appropriate
dosage.
by
the
same
token,
different
manufacturing
methods
can
also
affect
how
the
drug
works.
if
the
drug
is
packed
too
densely
or
too
loosely
into
the
tablet,
the
patient
may
suffer
from
wholly
unintended
reactions.
these
differences
are
vitally
important
for
generic
drugs.
these
drugs
are
offered
as
substitutes
for
preexisting
products
whose
effects
and
proper
dosages
are
well
known.
but
unless
the
generic
actually
performs
the
same
way
the
pioneer
does,
the
substitution
may
be
dangerous.
because
the
generic
company
does
not
know
the
full
composition
or
manufacturing
methods
of
the
pioneer,
the
only
way
to
be
assured
that
the
copy
and
the
pioneer
will
in
fact
work
the
same
way
is
by
testing
one
against
the
other.
if
they
perform
in
a
similar
way,
they
are
considered
to
be
bioequivalent
and
substitution
will
not
affect
the
patient.
but
if
they
do
not
work
the
same
way,
then
substitution
poses
a
real
danger.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
that
the
products
respondent
sold
were
not
tested
and
were
not
generally
recognized
by
experts
as
safe
and
effective
for
their
intended
uses,
and
that
was
all
the
government
needed
to
show
for
respondents
to
be
enjoined.
but
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
these
untested
drugs
could
be
sold
with
no
scrutiny
whatsoever.
the
court
wrongly
concluded
that
the
act's
use
of
the
term
"drug"
refers
only
to
active
ingredients
and
not
to
the
real
life
drugs
that
doctors
prescribe,
pharmacists
dispense,
and
patients
ingest,
that
is
drugs
as
products.
as
a
result,
the
court
has
discarded
the
carefully
crafted
statutory
scheme
that
assures
that
all
drugs
available
for
consumption
by
the
public
are
in
advance
determined
by
experts
to
be
safe
and
effective.
and
this
holding
creates
a
mammoth
exception
that
would
allow
untested
prescription
drugs
to
reach
the
public
simply
because
a
manufacturer
wants
to
sell
them.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
to
what
the
government
needed
to
show?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct.
the
district
court
tried
to
adopt
a
middle
ground.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
essence,
that's
right.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
our
position
would
apply
to
over
the
counter
drugs,
and
the
fda
treats
over
the
counter
drugs
in
a
manner
that's
consistent
with
the
statute.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
two
things
as
to
over
the
counter
drugs.
first
of
all,
none
of
the
drugs
involved
in
this
case
are
over
the
counter
drugs.
second,
what
the
fda
has
done
in
the
over
the
counter
drug
monograph
system
is
to
determine
practical
working
definitions
in
advance
of
general
recognition.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
read
it
literally,
but
they
understand
that
in
looking
at
what
an
expert
would
need
as
the
requisite
evidence
of
safety
for
an
over
the
counter
drug,
which,
keep
in
mind,
is
not
as
potent,
not
as
toxic,
and
has
a
much
wider
range
in
which
it
can
be
used
effectively
before
you
reach
overdose
situations.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
they
can
be,
and
in
fact
the
fda
does
have
regulations
relating
to
inactive
ingredients
of
certain
over
the
counter
drugs.
the
important
thing
is
that
in
both
cases,
the
prescription
and
over
the
counter
drugs,
the
fda
looks
at
products,
and
it
is
the
product
that
must
meet
the
standards,
not
simply
the
active
ingredient.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
think
they--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--i'm
trying
to
think
that
through.
it's
possible
that
the
results
may
be
the
same,
but
i
think
what
has
happened
is
very
different.
first
of
all,
we
are
dealing
in
this
case
with
prescription
drugs.
and
although
the
district
court
did
apply
the
wrong
standard,
it
did
find
that
the
government
had
shown
that
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
respondent's
drugs
were
unsafe
and
ineffective,
and
that
they
presented
no
evidence
to
rebut
that.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
government
does
not.
my
understanding
is
that
the
respondents
do
not,
either.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
definitional
line
is
that
if
the
finding
is
made
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
that
a
particular
drug
product
has
sufficient
risks
or
side
effects
attendant
to
it
that
it
cannot
be
sold
without
a
doctor's
prescription
and
under
a
doctor's
care,
those
drugs
require
prescriptions.
for
drug
products
that
are
ordinarily
used
for
minor
and
self-limiting
illnesses,
where
there
is
a
very
broad
range
in
which
a
product
can
be
used
effectively
before
you
reach
any
dangerous
levels--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--those
are
over
the
counter
drugs.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
if
it
complies
with
an
over
the
counter
drug
monograph...
and
i'm
assuming
in
that
case
that
you're
describing
some
kind
of
an
analgesic...
you
would
have
to
check
the
over
the
counter
drug
monograph
which
defines
in
advance
what
the
general
expert
recognition
would
be,
tells
you
what
active
products
must
be
in
it,
what
suitable
inactive
products
must
be
in
it,
and
what
dosages
are
allowable.
and
if
you
satisfy
that
standard,
then
it
could
be
marketed
as
an
over
the
counter
drug.
now,
my
understanding
is
that
at
the
present
time
the
analgesic
monograph
has
not
yet
been
completed.
but
that
is
in
the
works
as
part
of
the
overall
over
the
counter
drug
review
system.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
the
definition
of
drug
it
does
not.
in
other
provisions
of
the
statute
it
does,
where
it
imposes
certain
restrictions
on
drugs
that
can
be
sold
only
by
prescription.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
specific
case,
but
ordinarily
in
the
over
the
counter
drug
situation
the
understanding
is
that
information
can
be
provided
to
the
patient
that
will
be
understood
by
a
layman.
so
that
if
you
do
have
the
sort
of
package
insert
that
you've
described
along
with
an
over
the
counter
drug,
then
presumably
it
either
conforms
to
what
the
monograph
describes
as
what
the
packet
insert
should
be
for
the
over
the
counter
drug
or
it--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--some
warnings
are,
and
some
a
manufacturer
would
add,
i
assume
as
a
matter
of
prudence
in
particular
cases.
i'd
like
to
explain
why
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed,
by
touching
on
the
statutory
language
and
the
legislative
history,
and
then
turning
to
the
strong
public
policy
arguments
that
also
mandate
reversal.
the
court
of
appeals
went
astray
from
the
very
first
step
of
its
analysis
by
ignoring
crucial
portions
of
the
definition
of
the
word
"drug".
section
321(g)(1)
has
a
four-part
definition.
if
you
satisfy
any
one
part,
you
have
a
drug.
now
let
me
draw
your
attention
to
subsection
(b),
which
defines
a
drug
as
"an
article
intended
for
use
in
the
diagnosis,
cure,
mitigation,
treatment
or
prevention
of
disease.
"
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
a
word,
it's
nonsense.
as
this
court
said
in
bacto-unidisk,
the
statute
is
to
be
read
as
broadly
as
its
literal
language
indicates
and
not
narrowly
to
accord
with
any
particular
medical
or
scientific
definition.
so
in
terms
of
the
way
this
court
has
read
the
statute,
that
argument
is
not
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
use
of
the
word
"article"
in
these
formularies
that
are
the
reference
point,
the
formularies
in
fact
have
monographs
of
drug
products,
dosage
forms,
and
finished
products.
so
the
argument
is
not
correct.
it
would
also
not
make
any
sense--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--no,
it
doesn't.
in
any
of
the
subsections,
an
"article"
can
refer
to
an
active
ingredient,
but
never
to
an
active
ingredient
alone.
it
can
refer
to
active
ingredient
and
the
final
drug
product.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
as
these
cases
have
come
along,
the
government
has
assumed
the
burden,
in
an
injunction
action
such
as
this,
of
proving
that
a
drug
is
not
generally
recognized
by
experts
as
safe
and
effective.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
excuse
me?
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
think
there
are
good
arguments
as
to
why
the
burden
should
be
on
the
manufacturer,
because
the
statute
puts
it
on
the
manufacturer
in
the
first
instance
by
requiring
him
to
get
the
nda.
but
as
a
matter
of
history
and
practice,
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
sought
to
meet
that
burden
in
the
cases.
we're
not
asking
anything
different
from
this
court.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
been
consistent
on
the
critical
issue
that's
involved
in
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
the
fda
has
regarded
the
words
"drug"
and
"new
drug"
as
referring
to
products.
from
the
very
first
regulations
that
the
fda
issued
under
the
statute
in
1938,
it
said
that
differences
in
inactive
ingredients
may
cause
a
drug
to
be
a
new
drug,
and
that
regulation
has
remained
substantially
unchanged
to
the
present.
respondents
point
to
certain
practices,
some
of
which
are
no
longer
in
effect--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--"not
new
drug"
letters,
that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
stopped
in
1968.
it
is
consistent
in
the
sense
that,
first
of
all,
it
provided
notice
to
the
fda
that
a
drug
was
proposed
to
be
marketed,
and
such
notice
is
not
going
to
take
place
under
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
second,
it
was
clear
that
the
fda,
even
in
issuing
these
advisory
opinions,
was
looking
at
products
because
on
occasion
it
rejected
the
sale
of
so-called
generic
products
that
were
copies
of
the
active
ingredients
of
products
already
on
the
market.
and
third,
that
practice,
which
as
i
said
was
terminated
in
1968
when
all
the
"not
new
drug"
letters
were
revoked,
was
in
place
at
a
time
when
the
burgeoning
generic
drug
industry
was
significantly
smaller
than
it
is
today.
through
the
1960's
most
of
the
states
had
anti-substitution
laws,
so
that
if
a
brand
name
drug
was
prescribed
it
had
to
be
dispensed.
you
could
not
substitute
a
generic.
around
the
end
of
the
1960's
and
into
the
1970's,
the
states
had
shifted
their
position,
in
large
part
because
the
1962
amendments
to
the
act
that
we're
concerned
with
here
called
for
effectiveness
to
be
demonstrated
before
a
drug
could
be
sold.
and
in
reliance
on
that,
in
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
going
to
be
reviewing
in
advance
products
that
were
going
to
be
on
the
market,
the
states
have
moved
to
the
current
regime
of
drug
substitution
where
generics
can
be
substituted
when
the
brand
name
has
been
indicated
but
the
doctor
allows
substitution.
and
that
points
up
one
of
the
major
problems
in
this
case.
unless
the
generics
are
subject
to
fda
scrutiny,
the
doctor
is
not
going
to
know
what
product
his
patient
is
actually
getting.
he's
not
going
to
know
how
the
inactive
ingredients
may
differ,
he's
not
going
to
know
how
the
manufacturing
methods
may
differ.
the
patient
may
end
up
with
results
that
are
altogether
different
from
what
the
doctor
intended.
and
because
the
doctor
doesn't
what
drug--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
he
will.
and
that
was
what
the
testimony
in
this
case
was,
that
doctors,
as
they
had
experience
with
generic
drugs
that
simply
failed
to
do
what
they
purported
to
do
and
found
that
when
they
shifted
their
patients
back
to
the
brand
name
drugs
that
the
situations
were
remedied...
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
going
to
happen.
the
generic
drug
industry
is
going,
and
the
demand
for
generic
drugs
is,
as
the
amicus
briefs
indicate,
going
to
evaporate
if
there
can
be
no
assurance
for
doctors,
pharmacists
and
patients
that
they're
actually
getting
the
drugs
that
they
think
they're
getting.
the
other
difficulty
is
that
the
doctor
may
never
know
that
there
was
a
problem
with
the
drug,
in
the
case
of
a
progressive
disease--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--he
should
know,
but
he
often
will
not
know.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
can
do
that.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
and
they
often
do,
and
they
are
doing
it
more
and
more
as
the
problems
with
generic
drugs
are
becoming
more
apparent.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
it
wouldn't.
it
wouldn't
for
the
reasons
that
this
court
described
in
hynson.
a
drug
would
come
on
the
market,
to
take
one
example,
subject
to
an
approved
nda,
new
drug
application.
at
some
point
after
there
has
been
significant
experience
with
that
drug
and
enough
published
in
the
literature
so
that
that
drug
comes
to
have
general
recognition,
it
will
no
longer
be
actively
regulated
as
a
new
drug.
and
perhaps
i
should
say
something
here
that
addresses
a
problem
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
i
think
there
was
the
assumption
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
once
fda
approves
an
application
the
drug
is
no
longer
a
new
drug.
in
fact,
the
drug
is
a
new
drug
and
is
actively
regulated
as
a
new
drug,
including
requirements
that
the
manufacturer
report
to
the
fda
subsequent
evidence
of
adverse
reactions.
now,
once
there
has
been
material
usage
and
material
time
and
enough
expert
recognition
to
have
general
recognition
of
the
drug,
it
will
no
longer
be
in
a
category
of
new
drugs.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
no,
no,
no.
i
think
the
13
year
figure
that
you
use
is
something
that
respondents
argue
as
the
time
it
takes
from
the
first
concoction
of
a
drug
in
the
laboratory
up
through
the
time
that
you
get
approval
from
the
food
and
drug
administration.
that's
not
the
time
period
that
would
be
involved
for
generic
drugs,
because
the
fda
has
implemented
procedures
to
expedite
and
simplify
the
process
of
getting
approval.
in
fact,
there
have
been
recent
regulations
by
the
fda
in
the
federal
register
of
october
11th,
and
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
making
great
progress
towards
simplifying
the
process
so
that
it
will
be
a
much
quicker
one.
as
i
recall,
the
evidence
in
terms
of
those
regulations
is
that
it
may
take
approximately
two
years
for
an
application
to
be
approved
from
the
time
it
is
submitted
and
filed
with
the
fda
to
the
time
that
it
is
approved.
but
the
active
regulation
as
a
new
drug
would
continue
thereafter.
now,
the
portion
of
the
statutory
definition
of
the
word
(b),
is
something
that
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
altogether,
and
its
finding
that
only
the
active
ingredients
are
covered
finds
no
support
in
the
statutory
language.
the
court
of
appeals'
error
is
even
clearer
when
viewed
in
the
full
context
of
the
act.
congress
passed
this
act
in
1938
in
the
wake
of
the
elixir
sulfanilamide
tragedy,
in
which
more
than
100
people
were
killed
by
an
unsafe
inactive
ingredient
in
a
drug
that
had
the
same
active
ingredient
as
another
product
that
had
been
used
safely
for
years.
the
act
was
passed
to
ensure
that
such
incidents
never
be
repeated.
the
congress
went
about
this
task
with
great
care.
it
established
a
statutory
scheme
that
we've
discussed
in
some
detail
already.
under
this
scheme
all
drugs
would
be
subject
to
expert
scrutiny
before
they
could
be
sold.
and
the
cornerstone
of
this
legislation
is
the
nda
process.
now,
i
should
add
that
in
the
statute
congress
specifically
identified
the
information
that
was
to
be
supplied
in
an
nda,
and
that
included,
in
addition
to
evidence
of
testing
to
establish
a
drug's
safety,
all
the
ingredients
in
the
drug
must
be
listed
and
the
precise
methods
of
manufacture
supplied.
so
it's
clear
that
from
the
very
start
congress
expressed
its
concern
for
inactive
ingredients
and
manufacturing
methods,
as
well
it
should
have
after
the
elixir
sulfanilamide
situation.
now,
congress
amended
the
act
in
1962
following
the
thalidomide
tragedy
in
europe.
at
that
time
it
expressed
its
approval
of
fda's
efforts
in
keeping
thalidomide
off
the
market,
and
it
expanded
the
act's
protection
of
the
public
by
adding
the
standard
of
drug
effectiveness,
so
that
now
a
manufacturer
must
demonstrate
by
substantial
evidence
that
its
product
is
both
safe
and
effective
for
its
intended
use
before
it
can
be
sold.
and
there
was
no
indication
in
1962,
or
1938
for
that
matter,
of
any
congressional
intent
to
weaken
fda's
power
to
keep
unapproved
drugs
off
the
market.
aside
from
the
preclearance
program,
the
act
also
provides
other
means
for
ensuring
that
drugs,
once
on
the
market,
perform
as
they
are
supposed
to.
while
these
misbranding
and
adulteration
provisions
are
important
enforcement
tools,
they
address
only
products
already
being
sold
and
are
not
a
substitute
for
premarket
review,
nor
were
they
intended
to
be
such
a
substitute,
as
again
the
elixir
sulfanilamide
history
shows.
that
drug
was
in
fact
seized
as
misbranded,
but
the
experience
led
congress
to
conclude
that
such
after
the
fact
remedies
alone
were
not
enough.
now,
in
totally
exempting
the
generic
drugs
from
the
nda
process
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
they
may
be
sold
even
though
they're
not
tested,
as
was
the
case
with
the
drugs
in
this
case.
and
under
the
decision
below,
because
there
will
not
be
an
approved
nda
for
these
products,
they
are
also
exempt
from
other
safeguards.
among
these
is
the
requirement
i
mentioned
before,
that
the
nda
holder
report
subsequent
evidence
of
adverse
reactions
under
section
355(j).
when
circumstances
warrant,
the
agency
may
withdraw
its
approval
and
in
that
event
the
drug
may
no
longer
be
sold.
this
exemption
that
the
court
of
appeals
created
was
unintended
by
congress,
and
in
reaching
the
conclusion
it
did
the
court
of
appeals
acted
in
a
manner
that
was
contrary
to
the
way
this
court
has
consistently
interpreted
the
act.
dotterweich,
bacto-unidisk,
rutherford,
hynson,
and
the
park
case
in
1975
teach
us
that
the
act
is
to
be
read
broadly
and
its
exceptions
narrowly,
in
order
to
give
full
effect
to
congress'
effort
to
protect
the
public.
i
mentioned
also
the
fda
experience
of
40
years,
the
question
i
had
before
as
to
whether
we've
changed
our
mind.
we
explained
in
our
brief
why
on
the
critical
issue
in
this
case
we
haven't
changed
our
mind.
if
respondents
contention
is
right
that
there
has
been
some
agency
vacillation,
what
we
are
doing
now
is
returning
to
where
we
were
in
1938.
we
are
not
coming
up
with
something
new.
and
we
are
recognizing
that
the
congressional
intent
to
incorporate
ongoing
medical
and
scientific
research,
which
today
leaves
no
doubt
and
is
undisputed
that
differences
in
inactive
ingredients
and
manufacturing
methods
often
can
cause
differences
in
the
way
the
products
react...
taking
all
of
this
into
consideration,
the
fact
is
that
we're
consistent
on
the
main
issue,
and
if
in
fact
we've
changed
our
mind,
then
as
this
court
said
in
the
1978
nlrb
versus
iron
workers
case,
the
agency
is
certainly
entitled
to
change
its
mind
and
its
interpretation
should
still
stand
so
long
as
it's
a
defensible
interpretation
of
the
statute,
as
this
one
certainly
is.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
an
approved
pioneer
drug--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
must
file.
it
could
be
a
supplement,
depending
on
how
drastic
the
change
might
be.
it
could
be
a
supplement,
it
could
be
an
amendment.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
but
the
fact
is
that
the
manufacturer
is
making
a
change
in
the
product
that's
been
approved.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
or
an
amendment
or
a
supplement.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
could
be.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
you
change
the
inactive
ingredient--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--he
has
a
new
drug.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
it
could
be
an
anda
or
one
of
the
other.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
he
would
have
to
file
something
to
notify
the
fda,
because
he's
no
longer
manufacturing
the
product
that
had
been
approved.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
i
can
eliminate
the
word
fda
does
not.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
states
do
not
have
any
premarket
clearance
system.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
when
used
properly,
it
should
not
be.
that's
the
problem.
none
of
these
drugs
are
harmless.
they
have
to
be
used
properly
and
their
effects
have
to
be
known,
and
they
have
to
be
known
in
advance.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes,
just
briefly.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
yes,
there
is
a
statutory
provision
that
does
provide
the
distinction.
it
is
21
usc
353(b)(1),
that
describes
the
situations
in
which
a
drug
would
have
to
be
sold
only
under
a
doctor's
prescription.
basically,
as
i
said
earlier,
prescription
drugs
are
used
for--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--it
certainly
does.
the
only
drugs
that
were
at
issue--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
only
drugs
referred
to
in
the
complaint
and
the
request
for
preliminary
injunction
were
prescription
drugs.
the
only
drugs
discussed
at
the
hearing
on
the
preliminary
injunction
were
prescription
drugs.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
there
is
a
statutory
basis
for
treating
them
differently.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
definition
is
the
same,
that's
correct.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
that's
correct,
but
there
is
this
other
provision
in
section
353
that
does
set
out
a
basis
for
recognizing
that
prescription
drugs
used
for
serious
and
life-threatening
diseases
are
something
other
than
drugs
that
can
be
sold
over
the
counter
and
used
by
laymen.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
if
that
were
the
case,
and
i
disagree
with
it,
it
would
be
something
that
we
would
have
to
take
up
at
that
time.
it
is
not
this
case,
and
it
never
has
been
this
case.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
i
don't
agree,
but
if
there
will
be
another
case,
then
so
be
it.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
adverse
consequences
is
that
this
industry
of
unapproved
generic
drugs
is
in
large
part
a
creature
of
dictum
in
the
linette
decision.
it
was
cited
and
discussed
broadly
in
the
merchandising
materials
that
respondents
put
out,
and
that
are
in
the
record
in
this
case.
it
spawned
an
industry.
it
was
dictum
from
which
the
third
circuit
has
arguably
withdrawn
in
its
review
in
the
pharmadyne
case.
the
fact
is
that
without
the
fda
there
to
review
these
drugs
before
they
reach
the
market,
they
are
going
to
reach
the
market.
we
have
the
situation,
and
i
refer
you
to
paragraph
15
of--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
we
may
not
know
about
them--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
one
of
the
reasons
we
found
out
is
that
there
had
to
be
a
recall
of
the
pherocemyde
that
was
being
distributed.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
if
people...
if
there
is
compliance,
we
are
going
to
know
more--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--and
if
there
is
not
compliance,
we
have
a
remedy
for
going
after
them.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
they
referred
to
the
adulteration
provisions
as
a
substitute
for
premarket
clearancing.
i
suggest
that
if
we--
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
--well,
the
holding
in
the
linette
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case.
it
had
to
do
with
a
hearing.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
in
this
case,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
case
is
not
moot.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
the
other
reason
it
is
not
moot
is
because
they
did
not
agree
to
a
recall.
they
also
did
not
agree
to
an
injunction
as
broad
as
the
one
that
we
had
sought.
now,
the
suggestion
that
we
had
from
them
is
that
the
named
respondents
would
be
willing
to
agree
to
an
injunction.
what
we
asked
for
was
something
that
would
be
broader
than
that,
and
we
indicated
in
our
brief
in
response
to
the
suggestion
of
mootness
that
one
of
the
problems
it
that
they
have
shrouded
the
corporate
relationships
of
the
company
in
some
mystery.
now,
they
continue
to
do
so
to
this
date,
despite
rule
28.1
of
this
court.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
well,
or
reversed
would
have
been
the
preferable
course.
mr.
jerrold
j.
ganzfried
not
if
it's
moots
but
they
haven't
established
the
strong
burden
that
they
have
of
showing
mootness,
for
the
reasons
that
we
described
in
our
brief
addressed
to
that
subject.
i
was
going
to
talk
about
the
adulteration
provisions
in
which
they
say
that's
a
substitute
for
premarket
review.
you
could
get
at
these
drugs
after
the
fact.
i
commend
to
your
attention
the
secretary
of
agriculture's
report
on
elixir
sulfanilamide
in
1937.
it
demonstrates
beyond
any
doubt
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
kinds
of
issues
that
this
case
presents.
the
arguments
that
they
have
presented
in
support
of
their
selling
their
generic
copies
of
other
drugs
with
the
same
active
ingredient
was
precisely
the
defense
that
was
made
by
the
manufacture
of
elixir
sulfanilamide.
so
i
commend
that
secretary's
report
to
your
review.
thank
you.
