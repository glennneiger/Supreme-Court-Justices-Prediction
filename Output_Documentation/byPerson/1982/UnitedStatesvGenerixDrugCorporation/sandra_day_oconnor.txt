mr.
ganzfried,
isn't
what
the
fda
does
with
over
the
counter
drugs,
though,
somewhat
similar
to
the
test
that
the
district
court
would
have
employed,
where
it
said
if
there
is
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
differences
between
the
excipients
will
make
the
product
less
safe
and
effective
than
the
recognized
product,
it
would
be
approved?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
practical
matter,
is
that
what
the
fda--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--right.
but
i
take
it
both
the
government
and
the
respondents
do
not
support
the
district
court
test
for
the
prescription
drugs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
respondents
say
that
the
word
"article"
as
used
in
the
definition
is
a
word
of
art
and
refers
only
to
items
that
are
the
subject
of
monographs,
and
would
you
deal
with
that
in
your
discussion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
about
the
legislative
history?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
mean
something
different
in
the
different
subsections,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
left
of
the
exemption
provision
if
your
view
prevails?
certainly
when
the
statute
was
written
it
appeared
as
though
congress
thought
that
certain
articles
that
would
be
drugs,
which
were
widely
accepted
in
the
field
as
being
equivalent,
would
not
require
the
nda's.
and
under
your
view
that
kind
of
an
exemption
would
just
disappear,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
takes
what,
13
years
to
reach
that
stage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
greene,
in
code
section
321(g)(1)(d)
it
also
says
that
"drug"
means
"articles
intended
for
use
as
a
component
of
any
article
specified
in
clauses
(a),
(b)
or
(c)
of
the
paragraph.
"
"doesn't
that
indicate
that
all
of
these
excipients
are
covered?
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
definition
is
the
same,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
statute.
