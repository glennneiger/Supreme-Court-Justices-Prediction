justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
two
questions.
first,
you
don't
adopt
the
position
of
the
district
court,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
wrong,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is,
even
if
there's
no
evidence
of
dangerousness,
that
the
statute
still
applies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also,
your
position,
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
would
apply
to
over
the
counter
drugs,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
doesn't
require
a
new
drug
application
every
time
you
put
a
different
coating
on
a
piece
of
aspirin.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
just
don't
read
the
statute
literally.
they
just
say
they
don't
really
have
to
enforce
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
some
of
them
can
be
pretty
dangerous,
i
think,
over
the
counter
drugs;
can't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
statute
draw
a
distinction
between
over
the
counter
drugs
and
prescription
drugs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
what
is
the
fda's
position
with
respect
to
a
pioneer
drug
that
changes
an
inactive
ingredient?
say
they
change
from
the
pill
from
green
to
blue
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
must
it
file
an
nda?
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
they
just
change
the
coating
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
must
file
a
new
drug
application?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
wouldn't
be
an
amendment.
it
would
be
a
new
drug
if
you
change
it
from
blue
to
green.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
could
be
or
would
be,
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
he
would
be
required,
the
pioneer
drug
company,
would
be
required
to
file
an
nda?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
at
least
he
has
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no
matter
now
minor
the
change
in
the
inactive
ingredient
might
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
greene,
your
opponent
says...
i
haven't
looked,
of
course,
at
the
original
documents...
but
says
that
these
compendia
do
also
contain
some
drug
products
as
well
as
active
ingredients.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
by
trade
name,
but
is
everything
in
there
limited
to
active
ingredients,
according
to
your
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
"most"
seems
to
imply
that
there
are
some
that
are
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
some
of
those
preparations
include
inactive
ingredients?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
said
they
did
list
some
recipes
that
the
pharmacist
might
use,
which
would
include
both
active
and
inactive
ingredients.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
you
can
substitute
the
equivalent.
but
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
listed
in
there
seems
to
me
to
be
contrary
to
your
basic
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mrs.
greene,
in
the
section
that
requires
a
new
drug
application
to
be
filed,
doesn't
it
require
that
they
list
the
inactive
ingredients
of
the
drug?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
doesn't
that
have
to
be
broader
than
the
active
ingredients,
in
that
section
at
least?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
this
mean
that
the
position
of
your
client
and
perhaps
a
substantial
segment
of
the
industry
is
that
the
approval
by
the
government
actually
enhances
the
marketability
of
the
generic
drug?
justice
john
paul
stevens
apart
from
the
particular
articles
in
dispute
in
this
case,
your
client
no
longer
has
a
financial
interest
in
winning
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just
recognizing
there
is
a
difference
is
all.
if
your
position
is
vindicated
as
a
statutory
matter,
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
fda
from
tomorrow
adopting
a
regulation
saying,
we
are
going
to
require
premarket
clearancing
of
all
new
over
the
counter
drugs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
think
that
would
be...
somebody
could
easily
argue
that
they
would
have
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
might
be
the
consequence
of
this
case,
if
we
read
the
statute
the
way
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this?
supposing
we
did
conclude
that
the
case
was
moot
on
the
basis
of
what
has
been
said,
and
we
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
what
adverse
consequence
to
the
government,
if
any,
would
follow
from
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
involves
the
government
action
to
enjoin
the
distribution
by
generix
corporation
of
certain
drugs
called,
"generic
drug".
the
active
ingredients
in
most
prescription
drugs
constituted
only
a
small
proportion
of
the
total
product.
the
inactive
ingredients
or
excipients
are
most
of
the
bulk
of
the
product,
and
the
term
"generic
drug"
is
used
to
describe
a
product
that
contains
the
same
active
ingredient
as
an
approved
drug
but
different
--
but
may
have
different
inactive
ingredients
or
excipients.
the
government
brought
this
action
to
enjoin
generix
from
distributing
in
interstate
commerce
various
generic
drug
products
that
contain
the
same
active
ingredients
as
approved
drugs
but
not
necessarily
the
same
inactive
ingredients.
the
district
court
found
that
the
differences
in
the
generic
drugs
from
the
approved
products
might
promote
a
health
--
might
cause
a
health
hazard
and
therefore,
enjoined
distribution
of
the
drugs,
and
the
court
of
appeals
however,
construed
the
term,
"drug"
to
refer
only
to
the
active
ingredient
and
therefore,
reversed
the
district
court's
injunction.
the
question
we
had
to
decide
is
whether
the
word,
"drug"
in
the
statute
includes
merely
the
active
ingredient
or
the
entire
product
and
we
hold
that
the
term
does
include
the
entire
product
and
therefore,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
