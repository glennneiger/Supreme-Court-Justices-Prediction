in
your
view
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
determining
whether
a
drug
product
is
a
new
drug?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
willing
to
adhere
to
that
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
willing
to
adhere
to
that
position,
or
should
the
burden
be
on
the
manufacturer?
justice
harry

i
take
it
the
administration
has
not
been
consistent
over
the
years
in
its
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
for
30
years
it
issued
these
"no
new
drug"
letters.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
think
that's
consistent
with--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--well,
if
he
doesn't
know
why
shouldn't
he
write
his
prescription
for
the
pioneer
drug?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
isn't
it
up
to
him
to
know?
he
certainly
assumes
that
risk
with
a
prescription
drug.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
if
the
generic
is
a
bioequivalent
of
an
approved
pioneer,
is
the
situation
any
different?
the
legal
situation
is
not,
but
that
is
something
for
the
fda
to
determine
after
there
have
been
tests
and
a
submission
made.
it
is
not
something
that
the
manufacturers
are
in
a
position
to
determine
absent
conducting
bioequivalence
tests.
and
all
we're
saying
is
that
if
they...
basically
what
we're
saying
in
this
case
is
that
they
should
be...
we're
asking
them
to
do
what
they
hold
themselves
out
as
doing.
if
in
fact
the
drugs
are
bioequivalent,
they're
going
to
be
approved
and
they're
going
to
be
on
the
market.
but
if
they're
not,
then
that's
where
the
problem
exists,
and
those
are
the
drugs
that
congress
intended
should
not
be
on
the
market.
fda
is
the
only
agency
congress
created
for
this
purpose
and
is
the
only
central
clearing
house
for
this
information
that
can
possibly
make
those
conclusions.
it's
the
only
agency
congress
has
created,
but
are
there
not
some
state
agencies
that
on
occasion
are
even
more
careful
in
their
administration
than
the
fda?
i'm
thinking
of
over
the
counter
drugs.
in
some
states,
some
that
are
not
bothered
by
the
fda
are
prohibited
by
state
law.

after
all,
though,
aspirin
is
not
harmless.
