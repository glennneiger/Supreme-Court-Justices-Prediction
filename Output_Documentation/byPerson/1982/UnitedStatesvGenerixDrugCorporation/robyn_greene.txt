mr.
robyn
greene
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
does
not
involve
the
issue
of
whether
premarket
approval
of
generic
products
would
make
those
products
safer.
the
issue
is
whether
generic
drug
products,
both
prescription
and
nonprescription,
which
contain
active
ingredients
which
are
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective
are
new
drugs
requiring
premarket
clearance
from
the
fda
before
they're
sold.
the
issue
of
prescription-nonprescription
drugs
is
very
important
here,
and
it
wasn't
until
this
case
got
into
this
court
that
the
government
suddenly
took
the
position
that
only
prescription
drugs
were
involved.
in
the
complaint
which
was
filed
against
my
client,
the
government
sought
to
enjoin
the
distribution
of
all
unapproved
drugs.
when
the
case
was
argued
in
front
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
issue
of
over
the
counter
drugs
was
raised
and
discussed
before
the
court.
it
was
only
when
the
government
filed
its
petition
in
this
case
that
it
suddenly
claimed
that
the
issue
was
only
prescription
drugs,
and
it
was
joined
by
amicus
curiae,
the
proprietary
association,
which
represents
the
various
groups
which
make
over
the
counter
products.
the
government's
reason
for
trying
to
narrow
this
case
is
obvious.
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
prior
decisions,
there
are
in
excess
of
half
a
million
over
the
counter
products
currently
on
the
market.
it
is
simply
impossible
for
the
fda
to
approve
new
drug
applications
for
every
over
the
counter
drug,
and
in
fact
fda
does
not
require
over
the
counter
products
to
have
new
drug
approvals,
although
the
statute
in
question
does
not
distinguish
between
over
the
counter
and
prescription
drugs.
in
this
case
both
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
very,
very
clear
legislative
history
show
conclusively
that
congress
has
never
intended
that
each
and
every
prescription
and
nonprescription
drug
product
obtain
premarket
approval
from
the
fda
before
it
is
sold.
congress
has
rejected
licensing
of
products
on
at
least
three
separate
occasions,
beginning
in
the
1930's.
the
original
food
and
drug
act
was
passed
in
1906
and
during
the
early
1930's
congress
began
to
re-examine
it.
very
few
of
the
early
drafts
of
bills
before
congress
contained
any
language
about
premarket
clearance.
however,
there
was
one
such
bill
and
that
was
submitted
by
representative
coffee,
who
seemed
to
be
kind
of
a
ralph
nader
of
his
time.
he
was
a
very
liberal
man.
his
bill
was
called
the
consumer
union
bill.
he
believed
it
was
in
the
interest
of
consumers
to
have
product
by
product
licensing.
and
his
bill
specifically
provided...
he
used
very
specific
language...
each
product
must
get
a
license.
congress
didn't
want
to
hear
from
representative
coffee
at
that
time
and
his
bill
died.
the
elixir
sulfanilamide
incident
occurred,
and
at
that
point
there
was
a
great
hue
and
cry
to
have
some
form
of
premarket
clearance.
the
government
has
argued
in
this
case
that
simply
because
premarket
clearance
came
after
the
elixir
sulfanilamide
incident,
that
therefore
the
premarket
clearance
that
was
passed
must
have
been
product
by
product
licensing.
it's
a
non
sequitur
and
it's
simply
belied
by
the
legislative
history,
which
we
cited
extensively
in
our
brief.
representative
coffee
and
other
people
got
up
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history
and
said,
the
bill
that
we
have
before
us
that
is
going
to
be
passed
is
not
a
product
licensing
provision,
we
are
rejecting
product
licensing.
and
it's
just
clear
that
the
type
of
bill
that
representative
coffee
wanted,
product
by
product
licensing,
was
decisively
rejected
by
congress.
the
government
has
claimed
that
we
have
cited
snippets
of
the
legislative
history
in
our
brief.
we
have
devoted
at
least
five
full
pages
to
going
through
portions
of
the
congressional
record,
and
it
is
much
more
than
a
snippet
that
we
rely
on.
the
second
time
the
issue
came
up
in
front
of
congress
was
in
the
1960's.
in
the
1960's
senator
kefauver
wanted
product
by
product
licensing.
he
submitted
a
bill
which
provided
"that
there
would
be
licenses
for
the
maintenance
of
establishments
for
the
propagation
or
manufacture
or
preparation
of
products
described
in
subsection
(a)
of
this
section.
"
and
the
products
for
which
a
license
is
desired
must
meet
standards
designed
to
ensure
the
continued
chemical
structure,
strength,
quality,
purity,
safety
and
efficacy
of
such
products.
senator
kefauver
presented
this
bill
to
congress
and
it
eventually
passed,
but
in
a
much
modified
form.
the
factory
licensing
provisions
which
were
contained
in
the
bill
originally
remained.
the
product
licensing
provisions
were
taken
out.
and
this
was
in
the
1960's.
now,
the
court
i
think
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
fda's
position
has
been
anything
but
consistent.
for
at
least
30
years
it
said
that
what
my
client
was
doing,
namely
selling
unapproved
generics,
which
they
are
not
doing
any
more,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
suggestion
of
mootness...
they
took
the
position
that
it
was
perfectly
proper.
and
when
the
fda
last
came
to
this
court
in
a
case
involving
a
similar
issue
involving
generic
drugs
in
the
1970's,
it
argued
before
this
court
that
when
it
withdrew
an
approval,
a
new
drug
approval
for
a
pioneer
drug,
that
that
would
automatically
require
that
all
unapproved
generic
drugs
be
removed
from
the
market.
in
the
1970's,
this
court
recognized
in
the
hynson
decision
and
other
decisions
that
all
of
the
generics
it
was
talking
about
had
never
received
approval
from
the
fda.
it's
stated
in
the
opinions.
the
government
never
argued
that
these
products
were
not
legally
on
the
market
because
they
did
not
have
new
drug
approvals.
instead,
it
argued
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
new
drug
approval
for
the
pioneer
automatically
resulted
in
a
determination
that
the
generics
could
not
be
sold.
so
the
fda's
position
that
it
has
been
consistent
is
simply
incorrect,
and
the
fda's
actual
change
in
position
came
about
some
time
in
the
mid-70's.
after
the
fda
had
changed
its
position
approximately
in
the
mid-1970's,
the
third
circuit
decided
the
first
of
the
cases
which
involves
the
issue
here,
the
lannett
case.
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
i
think
the
government
is
correct
in
saying
that
they
always
had
the
regulation
on
the
book,
but
i
think
it
reflected
more
in
the
agency's
practice
than
in
anything
that
was
said
or
done.
they
started
to
file
injunction
actions
and
sue
people
trying
to
get
the
generics
off
the
market.
mr.
robyn
greene
not
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
not
in
a
reported
decision.
maybe
a
little
bit
earlier,
there
may
have
been
several
cases
that
may
not
have
reached
the
appellate
court
level
earlier
to
that,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
earlier
decisions
involving
the
generic
issue.
mr.
robyn
greene
i
think
probably
the
change
occurred
between
1968
when
the
fda
stopped
issuing
the
mid-1970's.
the
stopping
of
the
issuance
of
the
"not
new
drug"
letters
was
an
official
policy
that
could
be
pointed
to.
but
the
lannett
case
is
the
first
case
of
an
appellate
court
that
reflected
the
fda's
new
position
in
terms
of
generics.
after
lannett
was
decided,
the
fda
went
to
congress
again
in
the
late
1970's
and
it
told
congress,
it
said,
the
third
circuit
has
decided
that
generics
do
not
need
premarket
approval
and
we
think
the
lannett
decision
is
wrong.
and
the
fda
at
that
point
put
before
congress
several
bills,
among
them
senate
bill
1075,
which
would
have
legitimized
every
single
thing
that
fda
was
doing.
it
would
have
done
away
with
the
new
drug
provisions.
it
would
have
adopted
an
over
the
counter
monograph
system.
it
would
have
legitimized
the
abbreviated
new
drug
approval
process.
mr.
robyn
greene
that
is
a
possibility.
but
i
think
that
the
rejection
of
senate
bill
1075,
viewed
together
with
congress'
specific
rejection
of
premarket
licensing
in
1938
and
1962,
shows
that
congress
just
didn't
want
premarket
licensing.
that
rejection
of
the
statute
alone
in
1979
i
agree
would
not
be
determinative.
but
i
think
if
it's
viewed
in
the
historical
context
from
the
thirties
through
the
sixties
to
the
late
seventies,
it
shows
a
definite
pattern
on
the
part
of
congress.
mr.
robyn
greene
new
drugs.
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
i
think
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
statute--
mr.
robyn
greene
--it
is
not
a
product
licensing
system.
what
congress
had
in
mind
is
that,
for
example,
a
manufacturer
will
develop
a
brand-new
chemical
entity.
it
will
go
out,
it
will
test
it,
it
will
perform
investigations.
mr.
robyn
greene
and
then
it
will--
mr.
robyn
greene
--then
it
will
decide
whether
the
product
is
a
good
product
to
sell,
and
if
it
thinks
it's
effective
and
safe
and
useful
and
the
company
can
make
money
it
will
then
go
to
the
fda
and
it
will
seek
a
new
drug
approval
for
that
particular
product.
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
it
is
not
really
a
license.
it
is
an
approval
to
sell.
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
i
think
what
congress
was
rejecting
was
the
idea
that
each
and
every
product
had
to
go
for
an
nda,
because
after
the
product
gets
on
the
market
in
terms
of
an
nda
99
percent
of
all
products,
both
in
the
1930's
and
today,
are
patented.
the
company
which
has
the
original
patent
is
permitted
to
put
the
product
on
the
market
for
a
period
of
17
years.
it
may
issue
licenses
to
several
other
manufacturers
to
distribute
that
product,
but
the
product
stays
on
the
market
for
17
years
in
more
or
less
of
a
monopoly
situation.
at
the
end
of
17
years
when
the
patent
expires,
other
companies
then
are
free
to
come
in
and
duplicate
the
product.
after
the
17
years
some
products,
some
active
ingredients
that
have
been
sold,
are
then
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective
and
can
be
sold
without
premarket
clearance.
other
products,
for
example
a
product
like
oraflex,
which
was
on
the
market
for
a
year,
even
though
it
had
fda
approval
certainly
no
one
would
recognize
it
as
being
particularly
safe
today,
and
in
fact
it
has
been
taken
off
the
market.
so
the
17-year
patent
period
is
a
period
of
time
during
which
the
community
of
experts
can
formulate
opinions
about
whether
the
active
ingredient
that
is
being
sold
is
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective.
and
i
think
that
if
the
statutory
scheme
is
viewed
in
that
way
it
makes
a
tremendous
amount
of
sense.
the
bioavailability
and
bioequivalence
concerns
that
the
government
raises
were
dealt
with
by
congress
very
specifically
in
the
statute
that
exists
through
the
adulteration
requirements.
it
is...
under
the
act
as
it
has
existed
since
the
1930's,
a
manufacturer
is
not
allowed
to
sell
a
product
if
its
strength,
quality
or
purity
falls
below
compendial
standards
as
recognized
in
the
united
states
pharmacopoeia
or
the
national
formulary,
both
of
which
are
expressly
mentioned
as
guidelines
in
the
statute.
if
one
opens
the
united
states
pharmacopoeia
and
the
national
formulary,
one
finds
mainly
definitions
of
drug
substances,
and
the
drug
substances
are
listed
and
underneath
it
will
give
the
percentage
of
the
active
ingredient
that
should
be
found
in
the
product
that
is
sold,
and
there
are
disintegration
requirements.
the
formulary
and
the
pharmacopoeia
both
in
the
1930's
and
in
the
1980's
would
not
tell
a
neighborhood
pharmacist
or
a
manufacturer
exactly
how
to
fabricate
a
product.
rather,
they
would
set
standards,
tolerances
within
which
the
products
had
to
be
made
in
order
to
comply
with
compendial
standards.
mr.
robyn
greene
the
compendia
do
not
contain
any
drug
products
at
all.
mr.
robyn
greene
what
they
do
contain...
if
you
go
back
to
the
1935
pharmacopoeia
which
congress
had
before
it,
most
of
the
items
that
are
listed
in
the
pharmacopoeia
are
drug
substances.
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
i
was
getting
to
that.
the
second
thing
that
the
pharmacopoeia
in
the
1930's
had,
they
had
items
called
official
preparations.
and
the
pharmacopoeia
was
more
or
less
at
that
point
like
a
cookbook
for
the
neighborhood
pharmacist
for
how
he
would
fabricate--
mr.
robyn
greene
--the
recipe
that
is
in
the
pharmacopoeia
would
include
inactive
ingredients.
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
1935
pharmacopoeia,
in
the
portion
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
it
said
that
pharmacists
could
substitute
a
suitable
dilutant
or
excipient
for
the
inactive
ingredients
which
were
mentioned
in
the
recipe
that
was
put
in
the
pharmacopoeia.
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
the
two
works
referred
to
in
the
statute
are
the
united
states
pharmacopoeia
and
the
national
formulary,
both
of
which
are
similar.
mr.
robyn
greene
they
used
to
be.
in
the
1930's
they
were
separate
competitors.
in
the
seventies
usp
bought
the
national
formulary
and
changed
its
function
slightly.
but
in
no
event
is
any
item
listed
in
the
pharmacopoeia
or
the
national
formulary
a
drug
product.
instead--
mr.
robyn
greene
--with
the
provision
that
they
could
substitute--
mr.
robyn
greene
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
contrary.
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
use
of
the
word
"articles"
in
the
statute,
congress
defined
a
drug
as
an
article,
articles
are
things
listed
in
the
pharmacopoeia.
and
for
example,
the
national
formulary,
which
is
mentioned
in
the
statute
today,
only
lists
drug
substances.
obviously
there's
a
kind
of
dynamism
involved,
because
the
pharmacopoeia
and
the
formulary
referred
to
in
the
statute
have
changed
over
a
number
of
years.
but
the
one
thing
that
is
definitely
not
mentioned
is
drug
products,
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
important,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
word
"articles",
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
determining
exactly
what
congress
meant
when
it
used
the
term
"articles".
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
i
think...
but
the
statute
still
uses
the
word
"article",
and
the
government
has
claimed
that
"article"
should
be
used
in
its
broad
generic
sense
and
not
in
any
way
related
to
its
use
in
the
pharmacopoeia
and
the
formulary.
if
in
fact
"article"
means
items
in
the
pharmacopoeia
or
the
formulary,
it
should
mean
the
same
thing
all
the
way
through
the
statute,
and
it
shouldn't
be
changed
in
that
part
of
the
statute.
there
are
various
items
recognized
in
the
pharmacopoeia
which
are
combinations
of
active
ingredients
and
are
specifically
listed
as
combinations
in
the
pharmacopoeia.
i
think
that
at
a
minimum
the
government
has
tried
to
take
the
position
partially
that
the
statute
is
unambiguous
and
that
this
court
should
not
look
at
the
legislative
history.
it's
our
position
in
our
brief
that
the
statute
at
best
is
ambiguous
and
that
any
ambiguities
in
terms
of
the
word
"articles"
should
be
resolved
by
reference
to
the
legislative
history.
i
think
in
resolving
the
issue
of
what
the
word
"articles"
means,
one
useful
thing
that
i
did,
i
went
through
the
entire
statute
and
i
looked
at
the
word
"drug",
and
every
time
it
said
"drug"
i
substituted
"active
ingredient"
versus
"product"
in
order
to
determine
which
interpretation
made
more
sense.
90
percent
of
the
time
it
didn't
make
any
difference
at
all.
but
in
a
couple
of
situations
it
did
make
a
very
large
difference,
and
if
i
can
just
find
the
one
place
where
it
was
absolutely
most
erratic,
section
502(i)
of
the
act
says:
"a
drug
or
device
shall
be
deemed
to
be
misbranded
if
it
is
an
imitation
of
another
drug.
"
now,
if
we
take
the
word
"product",
which
is
what
the
government
says
"drug"
means,
and
substitute
it
into
the
act,
that
portion
of
the
act
would
then
mean
a
product
shall
be
deemed
to
be
misbranded
if
it
is
an
imitation
of
another
product.
well,
of
course
all
generic
drugs
are
imitations
of
other
drugs,
and
if
you
use
the
word
"product"
in
this
part
of
the
act
it
would
effectively
outlaw
the
entire
generic
drug
industry.
and
by
substituting
in
other
parts
of
the
statute
it's
clear
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
the
word
"drug"
to
be
"product",
but
rather
it
meant
the
active
ingredient
or
combination
of
active
ingredients
in
the
product.
and
i
think
again
and
again
in
going
through
the
legislative
history,
congress
has
stated
that
it
is
relying
on
the
adulteration
provisions
and
adherence
to
compendial
standards
to
bring...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robyn
greene
yes,
it
does.
mr.
robyn
greene
in
that
section
of
the
act.
i
think
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
original
pioneer
drug
that
is
first
going
on
the
market,
that
the
testing
and
the
items
that
are
required
are
definitely
more
extensive
than
what
is
required
after
a
product
has
been
on
the
market
for
17
years
and
achieved
a
certain
amount
of
general
recognition.
i
think
before
the
fda
wants
something
that
is
brand
new
on
the
market
it
wants
to
take
every
possible
precaution
to
make
sure
that
a
disaster
will
not
happen,
although
even
the
fda's
efforts
do
not
prevent
disasters
from
happening
in
all
instances.
i
think
that--
mr.
robyn
greene
just
about,
but--
mr.
robyn
greene
--yes,
i
did.
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
the
government
and
i
are
debating
on
how
moot
it
is,
because
there
was
a
warehouse
full
of
drugs
in
miami,
most
of
which
should
have
been
destroyed,
but
the
marshal
can't
destroy
the
drugs
because
he
can't
burn
them,
because
it
would
pollute
the
air,
and
he
can't
bury
them
because
it
violates
the
toxic
waste
disposal
act.

[generallaughter.]
mr.
robyn
greene
yes.
we
pointed
that
our
in
our--
mr.
robyn
greene
--what
basically
happened,
and
the
government
has
ascribed
all
manner
of
bad
motives
to
us,
when
this
issue
came
to
the
public
forefront,
in
the
media,
there
were
some
very
unfavorable
reports
on
national
television.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
became
almost
impossible
for
someone
like
my
client
to
sell
unapproved
generic
drug
products,
and
my
client
was
not
necessarily
interested
in
the
legal
issue.
my
client
was
interested
in
his
business.
so,
he
just
stopped
selling
unapproved
drugs.
we
told
the
government
we
would
consent
to
the
entry
of
an
injunction
against
us
to
prevent
us
from
selling
unapproved
drugs,
since
we
weren't
doing
it
any
more,
and
we
didn't
plan
to
do
it
in
the
future.
mr.
robyn
greene
yes,
and
really
the
only
difference
that
the
government
pointed
out,
it
suggested
that
we
had
to
recall
everything
that
we
had
sold
in
the
past.
in
our
suggestion
of
mootness,
we
pointed
out
that
under
the
cases,
most
of
the
cases
that
exist
today,
the
fda
did
not
have
the
power
to
recall.
mr.
robyn
greene
we
believe
that
most
of
them
have
expired.
mr.
robyn
greene
we
thought
that
all
of
them
had.
it
is
possible...
there
are
a
lot
involved.
the
government
claims
that
there
are
perhaps
three
bottles
in
oklahoma
that
have
not
expired.
we
haven't
really
resolved
that
issue,
but
we
still
do
believe
the
case
is
moot,
and
that
any
problems
along
those
lines
would
best
be
resolved
by
the
trial
judge
on
some
type
of
a
remand.
in
fact,
i
checked
with
my
client
last
night.
they
are
not
selling
unapproved
drugs
as
of
today,
and
do
not
intend
to.
mr.
robyn
greene
there
is
no
question
about
it,
and
i
think
that
is
reflected
in
the
transcript
in
this
case.
the
government
witness,
dr.
palmer,
was
asked
whether
certain
drugs
were
generally
recognized
as
safe
and
effective,
and
he
said
they
were,
and
when
asked
why,
he
said,
because
they
have
fda
approval.
he
said,
whenever
anything
has
fda
approval,
i
recognize
it
as
being
safe
and
effective.
if
it
is
not
approved
by
the
fda,
i
do
not
recognize
it
as
being
safe
and
effective.
and
i
think
that
the
government
is
correct
in
a
way
in
saying
that
a
lot
of
doctors
do
not
have
intricate
knowledge
of
pharmacology.
they
look
at
the
fda
approval
as
a
stamp
of
approval.
mr.
robyn
greene
well,
my
client
will
not.
my
client
is
merely
a
distributor
of
products
manufactured
by
other
people,
and
there
are
a
great
many
manufacturers
on
the
market
who
make
approved
products,
and
in
light
of
the
adverse
publicity
and
the
difficulty
of
selling
the
products,
and
the
potential
exposure
under
products
liability
laws,
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
continue
in
the
practice.
now,
the
government
wanted
us
to
confess
error,
which
we
will
not
do,
because
we
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
absolutely
correct,
but
what
is
correct
legally
and
what
is
correct
from
a
business
point
of
view--
mr.
robyn
greene
--correct.
mr.
robyn
greene
no.
the
last
remaining
vestige
of
financial
interest
was--
mr.
robyn
greene
--were
the
drugs
that
were
in
the
warehouse.
the
injunction
case
was
never
consolidated
with
the
seizure
case,
and
we
received
an
order
requiring
the
government
to
allow
us
to
take
the
drugs
out
of
the
warehouse
in
miami,
and
this
court
stayed
that
order
requiring
the
return
of
the
property,
and
during
the
passage
of
time,
at
least
90
and
probably
100
percent
of
the
shelf
lives
of
the
products
have
expired.
that
was
our
last
remaining
financial
interest.
and
we
really
have
none
today.
but
my
client
said,
why
do
i
have
to
come
to
this
court,
and
i
said,
as
long
as
i
am
your
lawyer,
you
are
not
going
to
not
file
a
brief,
you
have
to
come
to
this
court.
we
think
the
fifth
circuit
was
absolutely
correct
from
a
legal
point
of
view,
and
the
government
may
be
entirely
right
in
saying
that
the
scheme
that
they
have
now
with
the
monograph
system
and
the
abbreviated
new
drug
applications
is
an
ideal
statutory
scheme,
but
unfortunately,
it
is
not
the
statutory
scheme
that
congress
passed
in
1938
and
amended
in
1962.
it
is
a
statutory
scheme
which
congress
expressly
rejected
in
1979,
and
as
good
as
it
may
be,
perhaps
if
i
were
the
legislature,
i
would
have
passed
senate
bill
1075.
it
did
get
through
the
senate,
and
it
was
rejected
by
the
house.
it
is
not
the
statutory
scheme
that
we
have
today.
we
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
right
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
brief,
and
that
its
decision
should
be
affirmed.
