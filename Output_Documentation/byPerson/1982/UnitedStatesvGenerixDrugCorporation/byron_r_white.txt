and
they
often
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
call
the
requirement
to
have
a
clearance
on
new
drugs?
is
that
some
kind
of
a
premarket
licensing
system?
there
are
some
kind
of
drugs,
i
suppose,
that
need
preclearance,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
what
do
you
call
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that?
is
that
a
limited
premarket,
market
licensing
system,
drug
licensing
system,
product
licensing
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then--
justice
byron
r.
white
--perhaps
approve
it
for
marketing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
a
kind
of
licensing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
it
you
think
the
congress
was
rejecting
in
the
legislative
history
that
you
referred
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
i
detect
that
you
are
about
through,
mrs.
greene?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
have
a...
i
thought
i
would
just
ask
you
if
you
thought
the
court
was
quite
wrong
in
rejecting
your
suggestion
of
mootness.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
it
is
even
more
moot
today
than
before,
if
that's
possible?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
that
if
we
had
accepted
your
suggestion,
you
would
have
lost
your
favorable
judgment.
we
would
have
vacated
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
you
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
still
of
that
persuasion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
haven't
all
the
drugs
that
had
been
distributed
expired
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
most
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
client
isn't
out
of
the
generic
drug
business.
it
is
just
that
your
client
will
present
them
for
approval.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
two
different
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
lawyer's
fee.
0
[generallaughter.]
you
won't
collect
that
from
the
government,
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
address
the
distinction,
if
there
is
one,
under
the
act
between
over
the
counter
and
prescription
drugs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
this
case
involve
only
prescription
drugs?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
position
of
the
government
all
through
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
there
is
a
statutory
basis
for
treating
the
two
categories
differently?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
still...
you
could
just
get
after
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
did
you
find
out
about
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
will
you
ever
be?
i
mean,
even
if
you
win,
you
won't
know
any
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
there
won't
be
if
there
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
isn't
compliance.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
blame
you
for
wanting
to
get
off
the
books
a
decision
you
don't
want
to...
that
you
think
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
would
like
to
get
this
particular
decision
off
the
books
that
you
think
was
wrong
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
it
reversed.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
instead
of
rejecting
the
suggestion
we
should
have
just
vacated
and
remanded
it
to
the
lower
courts
to
consider.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if
it's
moot.
