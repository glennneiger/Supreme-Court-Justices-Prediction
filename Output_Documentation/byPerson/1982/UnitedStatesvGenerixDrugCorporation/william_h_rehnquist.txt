what
is
the
definitional
line
between
prescription
drugs
and
over
the
counter
drugs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
i
decided
i'm
going
to
go
ahead
and
manufacture
something
called
"ufferin",
which
is
just
like
aspirin
only
it's
buffered
a
little
bit
differently
than
bufferin
is.
is
there
some
way
i
can
tell
whether
i
have
to
apply
for
a
new
drug
application?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
can
prescribe
and
on
the
prescription
write
"no
substitution".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
greene,
was
the
fda's
change
of
position
which
you
described
as
having
taken
place
in
the
mid-70's
evidenced
by
any
decision
or
statement,
or
was
it
simply
something
that
those
in
the
industry
could
tell
was
happening?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
previous
to
1975
they
had
never
done
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
apart
from
the
time,
the
year,
you
say
that
there
was
a
noticeable
and
sharp
change
in
policy
some
time
in
the
late
1960's
or
1970's?
