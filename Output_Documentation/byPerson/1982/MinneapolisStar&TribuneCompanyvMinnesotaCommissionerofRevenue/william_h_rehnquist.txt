mr.
brown,
when
you
say
the
large
circulation
dailies,
how
many
of
those
did
that
cover
within
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
approximate
circulation
of
the
newspaper
with
the
least
circulation
which
nonetheless
was
subject
to
the
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
law--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
that
be
rephrased
to
say
the
star
tribune
has
no
objection
to
the
state
of
minnesota
taxing
any
business
except
the
newspaper
business?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
imagine
3m
does
the
same.
3m,
if
it
sells
at
retail
probably
has
to
pay
a
sales
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
respect
to
the
brainard
and
the
austin
and
the
mankato
papers
that
apparently
are
also
subject
to
the
tax,
would
you
say
that
they
are
a
homogeneous
class,
if
one
can
speak
in
those
terms,
with
the
minneapolis
and
st.
paul
dailies?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
i
take
it
that
you're
not
suggesting
that
there
was
anything
other
than
an
economic
or
tax-oriented,
tax
policy-oriented
reason
for
the
$100,000
cutoff.
because
a
lot
of
other
newspapers
that
wouldn't
pay
under
the
$100,000
cutoff
also
are
published
dailies,
they
consume
newsprint
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brown,
i
take
it,
then,
that
you
adhere
to
what
i
think
is
your
position
that
if
the
minnesota
legislature
sits
down
and
says
50
percent
of
our
gross
revenues
are
raised
by
sales/use
tax
combinations
on
people
in
business
to
make
money,
and
we're
looking
at
the
present
structure
and
we
see
there's
a
sales
tax
on
almost
every
business
entity
in
the
state.
most
of
the
ones
that
we
can't
hit
with
a
sales
tax
we
hit
with
a
use
tax.
traditionally,
it's
been
very
tough
to
collect
a
sales
tax
on
newspapers
because
so
many
of
them
are
sold
from
boxes
or
by
carrier
boys,
and
we
think
newspapers
should
furnish
their
fair
share
of
sales
tax
revenue
to
the
state,
so
we're
going
to
tax
them
with
a
use
tax
on
ink
and
paper,
which
is
going
to
turn
out
to
be
less
payment
by
them
than
if
we
tried
to
tax
their
retail
sales
of
newspapers.
you
say
that's
prohibited
by
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
were
those
taxes
on
paper
in
england
part
of
a
scheme
whereby
sales
and
use
of
implements
and
products
were
generally
taxed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
quite
a
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
true.
but
i
think
one
could
read
the
first
amendment
to
feel
that
if
you
simply
singled
out
newspapers
and
taxed
them
and
didn't
tax
3m
for
its
sales,
or
any
other
minnesota
commercial
entity
for
its
sales,
you
would
have
a
real
first
amendment
problem.
but
if
the
newspaper
as
a
commercial
entity
is
simply
being
made
to
pay
a
fair
share
of
the
use
tax
load
in
the
state,
everyone's
entitled
to
their
own
opinion
about
what
the
first
amendment
says,
but
i
think
those
are
two
different
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
something
of
a
rhetorical
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
justice
white
asks
you
about
evidence
that
other
publications
paid
the
tax,
do
you
interpret
that
to
mean
evidence
from
the
receipts
department
of
the
taxation
division
to
the
effect
that
they
had
receipts
from
such-and-such
a
taxpayer,
or
whether
the
tax
is
intended
to
cover
other
publications?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
particularly
difficult
for
new
hampshire?
