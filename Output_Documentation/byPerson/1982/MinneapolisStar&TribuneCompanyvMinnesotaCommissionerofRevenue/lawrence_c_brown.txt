mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
this
honorable
court:
the
appellant
before
you
is
minneapolis
star
and
tribune
company,
locally
known
in
minnesota
as
star
and
tribune.
it
is
the
largest
circulation
daily
newspaper
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
this
appeal
presents
two
levels
of
issues
which
are
essentially
press
clause
first
amendment
issues.
the
first
issue,
as
we
view
it,
is
whether
the
state
of
minnesota
may
tax
publishers
of
minnesota
newspapers
by
imposing
a
tax
on
their
consumption
of
paper
and
ink,
or
whether
such
a
form
of
tax
is
prohibited
by
the
press
clause
of
the
first
amendment
in
this
court's
1936
decision
in
the
grosjean
case.
our
view
of
that
basic
issue
is
that
it
is
extremely
narrow,
it
is
essentially
a
revisiting
of
this
court's
decision
in
grosjean,
and
that
the
tax
we
challenge
in
terms
of
constitutional
magnitude
is
factually
indistinguishable
from
the
stamp
taxes
in
england
and
the
colonies
of
massachusetts
and
new
york
imposed
during
the
1700s.
the
second
issue
that
we
present
assumes
that
we
have
lost
on
the
first
issue.
the
second
issue
is
if
such
a
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink
may
constitutionally
be
imposed
on
the
business
of
publishing
newspapers,
then
is
it
still
constitutional
when
the
state
of
minnesota,
by
enacting
an
annual
$100,000
exemption
which
has
the
effect
of
imposing
the
tax
only
on
approximately
a
dozen
or
so
of
minnesota's
large
circulation
daily
newspapers
and
also
has
the
effect
of
removing
from
the
burden
of
the
tax
approximately
370
to
380
of
minnesota's
other
newspapers
who
simply
do
not
consume
on
an
annual
basis
$100,000
worth
of
paper
and
ink?
the
background
of
the
tax
may
be
summarized
briefly.
in
1967,
minnesota
for
the
first
time
adopted
a
sales
and
use
tax
program.
in
1971,
through
an
exemption,
the
use
tax
here
at
issue
was,
for
the
first
time,
visited
upon
all
minnesota
newspapers.
and
from
1971
until
january
1
of
1974,
all
newspapers
in
minnesota
who
consumed
paper
and
ink,
and
by
definition
since
paper
and
ink
are
the
only
two
physical
components
of
a
newspaper,
they
all
did,
they
were
all,
therefore,
subjected
to
the
tax
at
issue.
on
january
1,
1974,
by
virtue
of
the
annual
$100,000
exemption
and
thereafter,
during
the
timeframe
that
is
at
issue
here,
january
1,
1974
through
may
of
1975,
which
is
the
refund
period
for
which
this
action
was
commenced
in
the
hennepin
county
district
court
in
minneapolis,
minnesota,
the
only
papers
in
minnesota
who
paid
the
tax
were
the
large
circulation
dailies.
and
the
minneapolis
star
and
tribune--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--your
honor,
according
to
the
records
submitted
in
support
of
star
tribune's
summary
judgment
motion,
i
think
there
were
approximately
29
and
27.
i
may
be
off
a
little
bit
in
the
numbers.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
think
the
brainard
dispatch,
your
honor,
is
the
one
which
in
1974
was
not
subject
to
the
tax
and
in
1975
was,
and
it
was
at
about
14
to
15
thousand
a
year.
now,
i
may
have
those
years
backwards,
but
that's
about
the
cutoff.
the
procedural
background
in
this
case
was
that
the
action
for
the
refund
of
approximately
$875,000
of
use
taxes
paid,
was
commenced
in
august
of
1975.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
17-month
timeframe
which
is
the
defined
period
for
which
we
sued
to
obtain
a
refund.
we
proceeded
to
move
the
trial
court
for
summary
judgment,
and
in
support
of
our
motion
we
submitted
a
fact
record
consisting
of
affidavit
testimony.
there
was
also,
as
one
of
our
fact
showings,
an
affidavit
from
mr.
shaw
who
ran
the
minnesota
newspaper
publishers
association
which
sets
forth
the
statistical
basis
identifying
minnesota
legal
newspapers
and
the
relative
circulations
of
those
newspapers
who
do
pay
the
tax,
and
the
minnesota
supreme
court
has
set
forth
in
its
formal
opinion
in
this
case
the
statistical
data
defining
who
was
publishing
newspapers
and
who
was
subjected
to
the
tax.
the
trial
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
star
tribune
on
all
constitutional
issues
presented.
at
the
oral
argument
before
the
trial
court,
the
state
orally
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
records
submitted
by
star
and
tribune.
and
i
pause
to
note
that
point,
because
we
are
here
before
this
court
challenging
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
which
reversed
the
trial
court,
with
the
same
identical
fact
record
that
we
had
at
the
trial
court.
and
that
was
a
fact
record
which
the
state
adopted
as
its
own
in
support
of
its
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
state
has
never
submitted
any
factual
showing
that
would
in
any
way
indicate
that
the
factual
record
submitted
by
star
tribune
was
not
a
thorough
and
accurate
record
on
which
this
case
may
be
adjudicated.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
and
the
point
being
taxed,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
use
or
consumption
of
paper
and
ink.
we
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
that
under
the
first
amendment
and
under
a
combined
first
amendment
equal
protection
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
review.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
we
would,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
let
me
say
that
we
would--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--we
would,
sir,
but
we
would
do
so
first,
with
the
acknowledgement
that
in
no
way
does
star
and
tribune
challenge
the
power
of
the
state
of
minnesota
or
any
other
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
broad
general
revenue-raising
tax
powers,
to
impose
broad
forms
of
taxation
equally
and
non-discriminatorily
on
all
businesses
which
are
fairly
classified
together
with
one
caveat,
and
that
is
that
if
there
is
anything
left
of
murdock
and
follett,
we
believe
that
broad
form,
non-discriminatory
taxes
as
applied
in
certain
first
amendment
activity
may
be
unconstitutional
because
as
applied,
they
improperly
burden
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
activity.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
over-statement
because
the
record
that
we
submitted
to
the
trial
court
and
that's
before
this
court
affirmatively
establishes
that
star
tribune
pays
income
taxes,
real
property
taxes,
payroll
taxes,
all
business
taxes
of
broad
form.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
distinction
is
that
star
tribune
has
first
amendment
rights
under
the
press
clause,
but
3m
does
not.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
of
lead.
your
honor,--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--well,
not
all
that
ancient.
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
type
of
tax
generally
applicable
to
the
consumption
of
lead
as
it
applies
to
the
newspaper
business
probably
would
have
been
constitutional
because
i
can
find
nowhere
in
the
stamp
tax
cases
in
the
1700s
in
england
or
in
this
country,
direct
historical
reference
points
for
taxes
on
knowledge
which
were
imposed
on
the
consumption
of
lead.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
don't
think
it
would
be
like
a
payroll
tax
as
applied
to
the
business
of
publishing
a
newspaper,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
3m
does
have
first
amendment
rights
when
it
exercises
speech,
but
3m's
products...
i
thought
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
saying
if
they
were
taxed,
wouldn't
they
be
identical
to
the
tax
on
paper
and
ink
here
at
issue.
and
my
point
is
that
the
tax
on
paper
and
ink
here
at
issue
is
a
tax
imposed
on
the
consumption
of
those
two
commodities
by
newspapers.
and
in
that
context,
i
don't
think
3m
has
a
press
clause
first
amendment
right.
i
think
star
tribune
clearly
does.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
your
honor,
dealing
with
the
tax
here
at
issue,
the
statutory
phrase
that
is
pivotal
is
the
phrase
"publications".
that's
the
way
the
minnesota
legislature
chose
to
classify
it.
our
proof
here
endeavored
to
demonstrate
that
that
tax
is
only
paid
by
minnesota
newspapers,
and
by
virtue
of
the
$100,000
annual
exemption,
only
large
circulation
minnesota
newspapers.
in
the
case
of
3m,
i've
got
to
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
3m
had
ever
been
subjected
to
minnesota's
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink,
that
fact
would
appear
here
in
this
record
because
it
was
in
the
self-interest
of
the
state
in
meeting
our
arguments
to
prove
that
kind
of
fact.
there
are
no
such
facts
in
this
record.
the
only
facts
in
this
record
are
that
the
tax
which
the
legislature
imposed
on
publications
is,
in
fact,
only,
during
the
period
of
time
at
issue,
a
newspaper
tax.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
no.
textbook--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--i
think
their
products,
your
honor,
wind
up
being
taxed
on
the
sales
at
retail.
you
see,
you
have
exempt
publications
under
the
dichotomy
of
the
sales
and
the
use
tax
scheme
that
minnesota
has
established.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
substantial,
your
honor.
clearly,
they
do
and
yet,
they
do
not...
they
are
not,
by
statute,
subjected
to
the
use
tax
because
they
don't
meet
the
statutory
definition
of
"publication".
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
the
minnesota
supreme
court--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--that's
what
they
did,
judge.
and
they
accepted...
the
minnesota
supreme
court
accepted
our
proof
that
this
is
a
newspaper
tax--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--that
seems
to
be
what
they
tell
us.
and
they
tell
us,
nonetheless,
it
does
not
violate
the
constitutional
protections
of
the
first
amendment
under
the
press
clause.
they
also
tell
us
that
because...
and
this
is
a
very
telling
point
to
at
least
me...
they
say
because
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute
is
to
raise
revenue,
that
in
itself
insulates
it
from
the
constitutional
challenge
that
we
present.
well,
all
the
stamp
taxes
in
england
were
enacted
to
raise
revenues.
the
stamp
tax
of
1712
was
imposed
on
various
articles
of
commerce
including
the
paper
that
printers
had
to
buy
to
lawfully
communicate
with
their
readers.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
your
honor,
any
guess
i
would
hazard
would
go
beyond
the
record
of
this
case.
for
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
legislative
history
that
the
minnesota
legislature
sought
to
create
to
explain
why
it
did
what
it
did
when
it
did
it.
in
terms
of
my
speculation,
i
would
only
invite
the
court
to
look
to
the
effect
of
the
tax.
we
have
established,
we
believe,
that
the
effect
of
the
tax
is
to
tax
only
newspapers,
and
the
effect
of
the
$100,000
exemption
is
to
limit
the
impact
of
the
tax
on
only
a
dozen
or
so
of
minnesota's
largest
circulation
newspapers.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that's
correct,
your
honor,
the
minneapolis
and
st.
paul
newspapers.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
wouldn't
call
them
homogeneous;
i
would
call
them
competitors,
because
the
circulation
of
the
twin
cities
newspapers
of
minneapolis
and
st.
paul
extends
throughout
the
state
of
minnesota
and
into
adjoining
states.
they
are
homogeneous,
your
honor,
in
that
they
are
all
newspapers.
they
are
homogenous
in
that
they
are
all
in
the
business
of
publishing
newspapers,
and
to
the
extent
their
circulation
levels
are
sufficient
to
consume
enough
paper
and
ink
to
exceed
the
annual
exemption,
they
are
homogenous
in
that
they
all
have
to
pay
some
amount
of
tax.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i'm
afraid
i
can't
go
that
far.
perhaps
my
experience
in
20
plus
years
of
practicing
in
minnesota,
watching
the
minnesota
political
scene
and
appearing
before
my
home
court
states
courts
has
tended
to
make
me
a
little
more
suspicious
than
that,
your
honor.
and
my
suspicion,
it
would
seem
on
the
record
of
this
case,
is
confirmed.
most
of
us
in
common
daily
life
are
judged
by
the
consequences
of
the
acts
that
we
perform,
and
that's
really
the
standard
that
we'd
seek
to
have
this
court
apply
to
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
that
this
is
a
constitutional
tax.
it
isn't.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that's
clearly
the
case
with
the
makeup
of
the
minnesota
legislative
bodies,
the
senate
and
the
house,
your
honor.
however,
i
don't
want
my
comments
to
the
questions
that
have
been
put
to
me
to
be
interpreted
that
i
think,
or
that
star
tribune
thinks,
that
legislative
motive
or
intent
is
critical
to
a
first
amendment
analysis
of
the
tax
here
at
issue.
we
have
taken
the
position
in
our
brief,
and
we
stand
by
it,
that
the
illicit
or
bad
legislative
intent
is
not
the
basis
for
the
holding
in
grosjean.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
you're
absolutely
correct,
justice
o'connor,
and
to
that
extent
i
believe
those
lower
court
decisions
have
misinterpreted
grosjean.
if
i
may
give
you
two
reference
points
from
the
transcript
in
grosjean,
and
i
think
we
only
need
two,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
parties
in
grosjean
knew
what
they
were
fighting
about.
at
page
45
of
louisiana's
brief
after
discussing
at
some
length
various
forms
of
taxes
of
general
application
which
in
the
brief
they
say,
we
could
have
enacted
those
kinds
of
statutes
and
had
a
lawful
test.
they
said,
the
tax
levied
by
the
louisiana
legislature
is
not
such
a
tax;
the
legislature
could
have
levied
such
a
tax
but
it
did
not
do
so.
instead,
it
imposed
the
tax
on
the
business
of
selling
or
making
any
charge
for
advertising
or
for
advertisements.
so
the
position
of
louisiana
was
we
have
the
power
to
impose
that
form
of
tax
on
the
business
of
publishing
a
newspaper.
at
page
30
of
the
appellee's
brief
in
that
case,
the
counter-point
is
presented.
these
appellees
are
not
discussing
the
burden
of
the
particular
tax;
rather,
they
assert
that
the
legislature
does
not
have
the
power
to
levy
a
tax
on
their
business
such
as
it
has
levied.
i
believe
that
the
holding
in
the
grosjean
case
is
simply
and
narrowly
that
there
are
certain
forms
of
taxes
which
legislatures
of
the
various
states
are
prohibited
from
enacting.
very
narrow
forms
such
as
the
taxes
on
knowledge
which
seek
to
impose
direct
taxes
on
circulation
revenues,
on
advertising
revenues
or
on
the
consumption
of
paper.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
we
do,
your
honor.
but
we
say
so
in
perhaps
a
better
context
than
i
think
was
your
question,
because
the
way
you
phrased
your
question
it
left
me
with
the
impression
that
you
feel
that
if
the
state
of
minnesota
lacks
the
power
to
impose
this
form
of
tax,
somehow
the
large
papers
in
minnesota
are
going
to
get
away
with
something.
and
if
that
is
your
honor's
impression,
i
would
urge
you
to
go
back
over
the
historical
references
that
we
have
cited,
because
taxes
on
paper,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
were
one
of
the
three
pressure
points
by
which
the
newspapers
in
england
were
regulated
through
the
direct
taxing
power.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
they
were
not,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--not
really
because
prior
to
1791
there
were
no
sales
or
use
taxes.
sales
and
use
taxes
are
relatively
new;
they're
depression
taxes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
your
honor,
my
response,
if
you
had
a
question
within
your
response
to
my--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--my
response
nonetheless
would
be
this.
we
thought
we
demonstrated
through
our
factual
proof
at
the
trial
court
that
star
tribune
is
a
good
dues,
tax-paying
citizen
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
and
there's
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
to
characterize
this
tax
as
a
normal
form
of
use
tax,
i
respectfully
submit
is
to
totally
mischaracterize--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--you
could,
your
honor.
however,
the
sales
tax
issue
is
not
part
of
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that's
correct.
whereas
this
tax,
your
honor,
comes
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
newspaper.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
that
is
correct.
under
minnesota's
sales
tax
approach,
star
tribune
and
other
sellers
would
be
prohibited
from
paying
the
tax
or
absorbing
it
as
part
of
their
cost--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--well,
we
do
argue
that,
your
honor.
the
only
reason
we
ever
got
into
the
sales
tax
issue
in
our
brief
was
with
great
reluctance
because
the
minnesota
supreme
court
appeared
to
us
to
endeavor
to
justify
the
constitutionality
of
the
tax
at
issue
with
the
assumption
that
a
sales
tax
on
the
sale
of
newspapers
would
also
be
constitutional.
it
is
clearly
not
an
issue
before
the
court;
the
parties
agree
on
that.
and
it
is
clearly
not
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
resolved
or
affected
by
the--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--your
honor,
our
position
is
this.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
all
right.
our
position
is
that
certain
forms
of
taxes
historically
have
been
proven
to
be
the
vehicle
by
which
legislatures
attempt
to
exercise
control
or
restraint
over
the
press.
that
is
true
of
all
the
stamp
taxes
that
were
imposed
on
paper.
the
legislators
of
the
1700s
were
less
inhibited
in
stating
their
true
reasons
why
they
imposed
taxes,
and
the
historical
references
make
clear
that
the
stamp
taxes
were
imposed
to
restrain
and
control
the
press.
it
is
because,
your
honor,
the
form
of
the
tax
being
placed
on
the
only
two
physical
components
of
the
newspaper
that
creates
the
danger
that
if
the
power
to
impose
such
taxes
is
recognized,
then
the
regulation
thereafter
is
gone.
whereas,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
general
sales
tax
there
is
at
least
the
comfort
that
the
newspapers
in
minnesota
find
themselves
in
bed
with
all
of
the
other
taxpayers
with
a
common
view
that
no
one
likes
to
pay
taxes.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
i
don't
mean
to,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
it's
a
difficult
issue
when
you
talk
about
a
sales
tax
of
general,
non-discriminatory
application
and
the
position
that
the
newspapers
may
take
at
some
point
in
time
in
the
future.
i
don't
mean
to
over-emphasize
the
point,
but
i
have
been
asked
questions
about
it
and
i
have
to
preserve
the
position
that
we
maintain.
i'd
like
to,
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
reserve
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
o'connor,
you
ask
mr.
kempainen
whether
there
have
been
any
changes
in
the
minnesota
sales
and
use
tax
scheme
since
this
litigation
commenced.
the
legislative
session
which
just
ended
a
few
weeks
ago
increased
the
basic
sales
tax
rate
in
minnesota
to
6
percent
on
all
articles
that
sell
for
more
than
9
cents.
they
left
the
sales
tax
rate
on
farm
machinery
at
4
percent,
and
the
sales
and
use
tax
on
motor
vehicles
at
5
percent.
i
point
this
out
simply
to
note
that
there
is
no
comfort
in
the
state's
argument
of
uniform
rate,
because
the
legislature
has
now
broken
it
down
and
rates
are
no
longer
uniform.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
mr.
kempainen
stated
that
you
must
find
bad
motive
in
order
to
invalidate
the
tax
at
issue,
and
what
you
do
is
you
look
to
legislative
history
in
order
to
establish
bad
motive.
well,
we
don't
think
bad
motive
is
material
to
a
first
amendment
analysis,
but
the
state
of
minnesota
here
has
created
a
situation
where
we
have
no
legislative
history.
if
mr.
kempainen's
approach
is
correct,
what
it
means
is
that
by
not
creating
legislative
history,
a
state
can
insulate
a
tax
on
first
amendment
activity,
and
if
bad
motive
is
a
requisite
of
proof
you
can
never
prove
it;
therefore,
you
can
never
challenge
it.
we
were
invited
to
come
here--
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
--the
cloverleaf
case.
mr.
lawrence
c.
brown
your
honor,
what
that
proves
is
when
the
minnesota
legislature
wants
this
court
to
have
legislative
history,
it
knows
how
to
create
it.
i
would
close
only
with
the
observation
that
we
were
invited
to
come
here,
as
the
transcript
of
oral
argument
reflects,
by
the
chief
justice
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
and
in
so
doing,
we
come
here
seeking
comfort
under
justice
holmes'
admonition
that
the
power
to
tax
is
not
the
power
to
destroy,
while
this
court
sits.
we
pray
that
you
reverse
the
judgment
appeal
from
him.
