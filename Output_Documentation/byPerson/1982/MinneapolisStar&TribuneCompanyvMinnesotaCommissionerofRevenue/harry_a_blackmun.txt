i
change
that
a
little
bit?
suppose

you
be
here
or
would
you
challenge
that
tax?

mr.

would
you
hazard
a
guess
as
to
why
the
minnesota

imposed
the
$100,000
exemption?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
95
percent
of
it
on

justice
harry
a.

of
course,
in
your
state
you
have
no
formal
legislative
history
ever,
do
you?

would
be
helpful
sometimes
if
