justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
case
was
judged
in
the
minnesota
supreme
court
on
the
basis...
was
upheld
on
the
basis
that
it
just
applied
to
newspapers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
only
certain
newspapers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
construction
given
of
this
statute
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
brown,
you
did
seem
to
indicate
that
both
the
sales
tax
on
the
newspapers
and
this
tax
at
issue
here
would
be
invalid.
but
i
would
suppose
that
you
could
sustain
the
sales
tax
without
sustaining
this
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
that's
certainly
right.
and,
of
course,
in
the
sales
tax,
at
least
theoretically,
it
makes
the
newspaper
more
expensive,
but
supposedly
you
collect
it
from
the
buyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
entitled
probably
to
pass
it
on.
but
nevertheless,
the
incidence,
the
sales
tax,
isn't
on
the
press.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
don't
know
why
you
wouldn't
argue
that
even
if
the
sales
tax
would
be
valid,
this
tax
is
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
brown,
you
sound
like
you're
making
an
intergovernmental
immunity
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
anyway,
it's
understandable,
against
that
background.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
has
paid
the
tax?
who
has
ever
paid
this
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all,
isn't
it?
who's
ever
paid
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
minnesota
supreme
court
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
this
was
just
a
tax
on
newspapers
who
consumed
more
than
$100,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
told
me
that
there
wasn't
any
evidence
that
anybody
but
newspapers
paid
the
tax.
so
what's
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what's
the
evidence
that
other
publications
have
paid
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
was
directed...
the
submission
is
that
this
is
a
tax
on
newspapers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
one
else
pays
this
tax.
and
you
say
that
this
is
a
tax
that
on
the
face
of
it,...
and
we
must
assume
it's
true
because
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
recited
it...
is
a
tax
on
all
publications,
if
they
consume
enough
paper
and
ink.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
the
next
question
is
with
the
exclusion
of
the
$100,000,
who
else
but
newspapers
consumes
that
much
paper
and
ink?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
may
not
be
absorbed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
besides,
isn't
it
subject
to
the
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
include
any
publication
that
is
subject
to
a
sales
tax
on
the
end
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
what
level
does
the
sales
tax
normally
cut
in...
a
penny
for
every
dime,
or
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
pay
a
sales
tax
if
you
buy
something
for
20
cents?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think...
you
think
the
newspapers
are
normally
sold
at
a
level
that's
above
the
cutoff.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
anytime
you
buy
something
for
25
cents,
unless
it's
exempt,
you
pay
a
sale
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your...
that's
easy
to
talk
about
the
special
needs
of
small
newspapers,
but
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
what's
the
special
need
of
a
small
newspaper
that
prompted
the
exemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
mainly,
they
couldn't
afford
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
purely
a
financial
break
to
them.
