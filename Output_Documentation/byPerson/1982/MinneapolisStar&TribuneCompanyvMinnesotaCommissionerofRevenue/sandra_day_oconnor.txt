well,
of
course,
there
are
decisions
that
have
so
interpreted
grosjean,
are
there
not?
justice
sandra

o'connor
under
minnesota
law,
do
you
agree
that
the
sales
tax
where
it's
imposed
is
passed
on
to
the
purchaser?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
requirement?

but
there's
also
no
requirement
that
it
be
passed
on.
justice
sandra

o'connor
has
the
legislature
made
any
changes
since
this
litigation
began?
justice

do
you
think
the
court
in
grosjean
would
have
reached
the
same
result
absent
huey
long's
activities
in
louisiana
at
that
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
this
court
has
to
look
at
the
potential
for
abuse
or
control
of
the
press
in
the
tax
scheme
in
determining
its
validity?
justice
sandra

o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota.
minnesota
imposes
a
sales
tax
on
most
retail
sales
but
not
on
the
sales
of
goods
to
be
used
as
components
in
the
production
of
other
goods.
the
state
also
imposes
a
complimentary
use
tax
on
goods
purchased
out-of-state
for
use
in
the
state.
publications
are
exempt
from
the
sales
tax.
in
1971,
however,
the
state
legislature
amended
the
use
tax
provision
to
impose
a
tax
on
all
ink
and
paper
purchased
by
publications.
publications
became
the
only
producers
required
to
pay
a
tax
on
the
purchase
of
components.
the
state
later
amended
that
provision
again
to
exempt
from
tax
the
first
$100,000
worth
of
ink
and
paper
consumed
by
a
publication
in
a
calendar
year.
as
a
result,
only
a
handful
of
newspapers
incurred
any
liability
at
all
for
the
ink
and
paper
tax.
and
the
appellant,
minneapolis
star
&
tribune
paid
roughly
two
thirds
of
the
taxes
collected.
it
brought
this
action
to
seek
a
refund
of
the
taxes
paid
alleging
a
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
minneapolis
supreme
court
upheld
the
tax.
we
now
reverse.
minnesota's
ink
and
paper
tax
is
a
special
tax
that
singles
out
the
press
for
treatment
different
from
that
of
other
taxpayers.
special
taxation
of
this
type
was
among
the
concerns
of
the
framers
of
the
first
amendment.
and
it
necessarily
places
a
burden
upon
the
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
unless
the
state
presents
a
governmental
interest
that
could
not
be
achieved
without
the
burden
on
first
amendment
rights,
and
that
is
sufficient
to
counterbalance
the
burden,
its
tax
cannot
survive
review.
minnesota
has
asserted
no
such
interest
here.
further,
minnesota's
tax
is
objectionable
because
the
structure
of
the
exemptions
is
tailored
to
target
a
few
publications
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
tax
while
excusing
all
others.
again,
the
state
has
not
offered
an
adequate
justification
for
this
burden
on
first
amendment
rights.
