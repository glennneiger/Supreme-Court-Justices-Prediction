mr.
brown,
back
in
the
days
of
the
liner
type,
could
minnesota
tax
all
users
of
lead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
back
when
you
had
liner
type.
ancient
history.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
be
like
a
payroll
tax.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
if
it
was
a
revenue-raising
act,
why
leave
out
all
those
newspapers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
probably
be
the
biggest,
wouldn't
they?
west
publishing
company
certainly
uses
more.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
does
use
as
much
paper
and
ink
as
a
newspaper
does.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
think
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
understand
your
position
to
be...
i
understand
the
position
to
be
that
in
england,
the
first
set
of
taxes
were
very
inocuous
and
they
went
on
and
on
and
on.
and
eventually,
they
went
too
far.
and
i
understand
the
position
to
be
that
if
they
let
down
and
let
you
start
this,
in
years
to
come
it
might
get
worse.
isn't
that
more
what
their
argument
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
only
said
i
thought
that
was
their
position.
