mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1971,
the
state
of
minnesota
was
engaged
in
fashioning
one
of
its
most
important
social
and
political
programs
in
its
history.
the
result
was
a
comprehensive
tax
and
financial
reform
act
which
took
up
over
116
pages.
over
half
of
this
volume
of
the
minnesota
special
session
laws
for
that
year.
enacted
as
part
and
parcel
of
this
law
and
yet
taking
up
only
one-half
of
a
page
in
it,
was
the
basic
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink
that
we
have
here.
now,
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
read
this
large
tax
reform
measure
in
order
to
understand
that
its
basic
purpose
was
revenue
raising,
its
basic
purpose
was
a
social
program
of
creating
more
equal
educational
opportunities
for
minnesotans.
the
basic
thrust
of
the
1971
law,
of
which
the
basic
use
tax
here
was
a
part,
was
to
lower
the
overall
property
tax
burdens
in
minnesota
which
were
very
high
at
the
time,
and
to
make
up
for
the
subsequent
loss
in
revenue
through
increasing
the
statewide
income
tax
and
the
statewide
sales
and
use
tax,
and
then
to
redistribute
that
revenue
back
to
the
local
governments
and
particularly,
back
to
local
school
districts
for
the
purpose,
the
avowed
purpose,
of
equalizing
educational
opportunity
throughout
minnesota
at
that
time.
it
was
an
important
social
experiment
in
minnesota
and
it
happened
to
be
a
successful
one,
at
least
in
the
early
1970s
when
it
became
popularly
known
as
the
minnesota
miracle.
this
legislative
background,
which
we
feel
the
appellant
has
given
inadequate
treatment
to,
as
well
as
the
statutory
language
of
this
tax
on
its
face
shows
that
minnesota's
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink,
the
basic
use
tax,
is
purely
and
simply
a
revenue-raising
measure.
no
other
purpose
either
has
been
or
can
be
ascribed
to
it
under
this
record.
this
history
as
well
as
the
statutory
language
also
shows
that
minnesota's
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink
is
an
integral
part
of
a
general
system
of
taxation,
and
that
it
is
tied
to
the
general
sales
and
use
tax
rate.
in
1971
it
was
imposed
at
the
same
sales
and
use
tax
rate,
4
percent,
as
all
other
sales
and
use
taxes
in
minnesota.
and
today
it
is
still
tied
to
that
same
general
rate.
therefore,
the
rate
of
tax
upon
paper
and
ink
cannot
be
increased
without
also
raising
the
rate
upon
all
other
businesses
subject
to
the
sales
and
use
tax
in
the
state.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
point
out
that
this
legislative
history
and
the
statutory
language
on
its
face
shows
that
this
tax
was
imposed
at
the
lesser
wholesale
value
of
the
paper
and
ink
and
not
at
its
retail
value
when
it's
finally
incorporated
into
the
final
product.
which
would
have
been
the
case
if
a
general
sales
tax
had
been
imposed
upon
all
newspapers.
i
think
the
minnesota
legislature
back
in
1971
was
seeking
to
achieve
a
revenue-raising
purpose
and
tailored
its
statute
so
as
to
achieve
that
revenue-raising--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--your
honor,
the
$100,000
exclusion
was,
admittedly,
not
for
a
revenue-raising
purpose.
instead,
we
contend
it
was
for
another
purpose,
and
that
purpose
was
to
establish
this
taxing
scheme
as
being
more
equitable,
taking
into
account
the
special
problems
dealt
with
by
small
publishers
through
a
device,
i
would
point,
which
is
an
exclusion
that
applies
equally
and
with
the
same
benefit
to
even
the
large
publishers
across
the
board.
this
history,
as
well
as
the
statutory
language,
also
points
out...
and
especially
the
statutory
language,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question
of
the
appellant...
is
that
this
does
apply
to
all
publications
across
the
board...
publications
as
they
are
defined
in
the
minnesota
statutes.
when
minnesota
first
enacted
its
sales
and
use
tax
in
1967,
it
did
not
exempt
all
printed
matter
per
se,
even
though
all
printed
matter,
obviously,
is
subject
to
first
amendment
protections.
instead,
it
created
a
specific
class
of
printed
matter
which
it
deemed
to
be
publications,
and
that
definition
of
what
consists
of
publications
is
printed
matter
which
is
set
out
at
intervals
of
three
months
or
less.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
on
this
record,
your
honor,
we
only
have
evidence
that
the
newspapers
have
paid
the
tax.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
no,
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
and
in
any
event--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--no.
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
and
i
was
getting
to
that
point.
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion
on
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
a2,
the
state
supreme
court
said,
that
this
tax
is
paid
by
some
newspapers
and
publications,
but
not
all.
therefore,
at
the
very
beginning
of
its
opinion
it
recognized--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--the
evidence
is
the
basic
statute
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
there
was
no
evidence,
your
honor,
and
we
did
not
submit
any.
we
did
not
feel
it
was
necessary
since
it
was
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself
that
this
applied
to
all
publications
and
not
just
to
newspapers.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i
take
it
that
justice
white's
question...
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
justice
white,...
is
that
the
evidence
is
that
particular
taxpayers
other
than
newspapers
did
pay
this
tax.
which
would
have
been
difficult--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--the
submission
by
the
star
tribune,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i
think
the
example
that
was
previously
given
of
3m
and
its
advertising
certainly--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--west
publishing
company,
your
honor,
does
not...
their
end
product,
their
books
that
the
west
publishing
company
prints,
their
end
product
is
subject
to
sales
tax
at
the
retail
level
and,
therefore,
is
not
considered
a
publication.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
oh,
it
certainly
does,
your
honor.
probably
more
so.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
and
the
paper
and
ink
that
is
used
by
west
publishing
is
already
being
subjected...
was
already
being
subjected
to
the
sales
tax
itself,
because
the
end
product,
the
books
of
west
publishing
company,
were
subjected
to
the
retail
sales
tax.
and
therefore,
the
value
of
the
paper
and
ink
was
being
taxed
at
that
point
in
the
commercial
flow.
and
getting
back
to
a
point
that
i
just
made,
what
the
legislature
did
here,
instead
of
imposing
this
tax
at
the
point
of
the
retail
sale
which
might
be
considered
too
close
to
actual
communicative
acts,
the
communicative
act
of
printing
and
disseminating
a
newspaper,
instead
it
went
back
a
step
and
it
tried
to
get
away
from...
as
far
away
from
the
communicative
act
as
possible
by
instead
taxing
the
wholesale
purchase
of
paper
and
ink
by
a
commercial
publication.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
the
sales
tax
may
not
be
absorbed.
there
is
no
requirement,
at
least
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor,
that
this
use
tax
has
to
be
absorbed.
the
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink
can
be
included
and
passed...
in
the
price
of
a
publication
passed
on
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
no,
your
honor,
that's
up
to
the
commercial
publication
in
their
own
discretion.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
the
term
"publication"
is
any
printed
matter
which
is
sent
out
at
regular
intervals
of
three
months
or
less.
so
it
would
include
news
magazines,
trade
journals,
serially-issued
comic
books...
there's
a
whole
laundry
list
of
publications
besides
just
newspapers
that
this
applies
to.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
no,
your
honor,
because
most
west
books
do
not
come
out
at
average
intervals
of
three
months
or
less.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
no.
the
west
book...
i
believe
you're
talking
about
the
federal
2nd
and
so
forth,
the
supreme
court
reporter.
that's
not
considered...
that's
considered
a
one-of-a-kind
edition.
each
one
of
those
volumes
is
considered
a
one-of-a-kind
edition.
so
when
it
comes
out,
it's
considered
a
printing,
a
single
printing,
each
volume.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i
think
a
greater
definition,
your
honor,
perhaps
in
less
formal
statutory
language
can
be
found
in
the
minnesota
regulation
dealing
with
the
statute,
which
is
found
in
ja
30,
the
joint
appendix.
and
there
it
goes
down
the
laundry
list
of
what
is
included
in
a
publication.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
in
order
to
perhaps
put
this
in
greater
perspective
in
case
there's
any
confusion
on
this
point,
in
1967,
minnesota
carved
out
publications,
which
was
a
broad
class
but
nevertheless,
less
narrow
than
"all
printed
matter".
those
publications
which
are
published
at
average
intervals
of
three
months
or
less.
there
was
no
sales
tax
on
the
retail
sale
of
those
publications.
everything
else
was
subject
to
sales
tax.
and
therefore,...
and
what
minnesota
did
in
1971
when
it
was
searching
for
additional
revenue,
instead
of
eliminating
the
total
exemption
from
the
sales
tax
for
publications,
it
instead
went
further
back
in
the
commercial
flow
of
this
transaction
and
instead
imposed
this
use
tax
which
we
have
here
on
the
wholesale
value
of
the
paper
and
ink.
which
the
record
shows
only
takes
up
between
20
and
25
percent
of
the
final
product,
the
final
newspaper's
value.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
oh,
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
take
the
position,
although
we
feel
it's
not
an
issue
here,
that
minnesota
could
have
imposed
its
full
sales
tax
on
the
publications.
and
the
fact
that
it
did
not
and
instead
imposed
this
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink
i
think
is
probably
one
of
the
things
that
got
the
state
of
minnesota
into
a
little
bit
of
trouble
here.
it
was
intending
to
be
solicitous
of
first
amendment
rights
and
instead
it
got
into
this
litigation.
and
the
next
step
two
years
further
down
the
line,
when
the
$100,000
exclusion
came
into
effect,
that
again
was
a
point
where
the
legislature
was
attempting
to
be
solicitous
of
first
amendment
rights,
especially
the
first
amendment
rights
of
small
publications
who
would
generally
have
less
of
an
ability
to
pay,
who
impose
fewer
social
costs
upon
society
and
therefore,
the
legislature
could
reasonably
conclude
that
it
would
be
more
inequitable
to
have
them
pay
this
tax,
the
full
measure,
than
it
would
be
for
a
larger
publication.
but
it
did
not
do
so
through
a
technique
which
simply
exempted
the
small
publications
and
then
left
the
full
measure
of
the
tax
on
the
larger
newspapers
such
as
the
star
and
tribune.
instead,
it
did
so
through--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--no,
it
hasn't,
your
honor.
the
$100,000
exclusion
has
remained
the
same.
and
the
$100,000
exclusion
applies
equally
and
with
the
same
benefit
to
the
star
and
tribune
that
it
does
to
the
small
publications.
the
effect
of
the
$100,000
exclusion
was
to
give
the
star
and
tribune
an
$8000
lessening
of
a
tax
bill,
a
credit
on
its
tax
bill.
and
we
simply
fail
to
see
how
that,
in
the
first
place,
can
be
considered
any
kind
of
a
penalty--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--well,
the--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
necessarily
take
it
that
on
a
general
law
that
would
otherwise
be
valid
imposing
valid
classifications,
is
necessarily
unconstitutional
because
it
applies
to
only
one
person.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
that
happens
in
a
lot
of
cases.
in
the
state
of
minnesota,
to
take
an
example
like
you
had
from
illinois,
we
had
a
tax
on
taconite
tailings
that
were
dumped
into
bodies
of
water.
well,
the
only
taconite
plant
in
the
state
of
minnesota
that
did
that
was
reserve
mining
company.
reserve
mining
challenged
that,
also,
on
equal
protection
grounds
and
lost.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
quite
understand.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
still
be
constitutional.
as
long
as
it
was
non-content
related
and
as
long
as
there
was
no
evidence
of
suppressive
legislative
intent,
which
there
is
none
in
this
case.
and
my
point
about
being
non-content
related
i
think
brings
me
to
the
uncontested
fact
in
this
case
that
minnesota's
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink
is
non-content
related.
it
applies
equally
and
across
the
board
to
whoever
comes
within
its
act,
and
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
subject
matter
of
the
publication
may
be.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i
think
assuming...
i
think
the
result
in
grosjean,
your
honor,
was
a
result
of
many
factors.
one
of
the
factors
was
the
legislative
intent
which
was...
and
the
suppressive
intent
was...
evidence
of
that
was
overwhelming
in
the
grosjean
case.
and
this
court
mentioned
it
in
its
opinion.
it
mentioned
it
twice,
that
it
was
that
purpose,
it
was
that
legislative
intent
which
had
a
bearing
on
its
decision.
perhaps,
though,
the
main
part
of
the
decision
was
the
fact
that
the
legislative
enactment
in
the
grosjean
case,
the
louisiana
statute
there
on
its
face
was
discriminatory
and
was
directly
tied
to
a
level
of
circulation
which
made
it
entirely
too
close
to
the
british
taxes
on
knowledge.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i
think
that's
true
to
a
certain
extent,
your
honor.
but
i
think
it's
also
well
to
point
out
that
in
a
couple
of
cases
in
the
past
which
upheld
otherwise
valid
general
schemes
on
regulation...
and
i'm
speaking
now
about
associated
press
versus
national
labor
relations
board
and
i
believe
the
other
one
was
associated
press
versus
united
states.
the
dissents
in
those
cases
also
looked
at
future
impact.
and
they
were
concerned
and
they
said
so
in
their
dissents
that
application
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
application
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
to
newspapers
would
open
up
a
small
crack
that
may
not
seem
like
much
now,
but
then
it
would
widen
out
and
pretty
soon
we
wouldn't
have
any
first
amendment
left
whatsoever.
of
course,
here
we
are
over
four
decades
later
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
still
applies
to
newspapers
and
the
first
amendment
is
just
as
strong
as
ever.
i
think
you
just
have
to...
it's
a
consideration,
but
i
don't
think
it's
all
that
important
a
consideration.
and
especially
in
a
case
such
as
we
have
here
where
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
legislature
had
any
sort
of
suppressive
intent
or
was
intended
or
out
to
get
newspapers,
or
even
big
newspapers.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
of
minnesota
does
not
make
a
practice,
like
congress
does,
of
keeping
a
legislative
history
on
any
formal
basis.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
that's
true,
your
honor,
if
they
had
the
money
to
do
so.
but
i
think
state
legislatures,
unlike
congress,
don't
have
the
vast
sums
at
their
availability
and
many
states,
minnesota
perhaps
and
new
hampshire
in
particular
i
would
think,
the
general
politics
of
the
state
just
would
make
it
impossible
for
a
legislature
to
spend
the
amount
of
money
that
it
would
take
to
build
up
a
legislative
record
on
every
single
piece
of
legislation
that
came
through
it.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
some
states
do,
your
honor.
the
larger
ones,
in
particular.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
oh,
i
just
mentioned
that,
your
honor,
because
they're
very
much...
i
was
reading
an
article
recently
about--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--yes,
it's
a
large
assembly,
your
honor,
and
they
don't
like
taxes
in
new
hampshire.
there's
no
income
tax
or
sales
tax
in
new
hampshire.
and
the
reason
i
mentioned
that,
your
honor,
is
i
read
an
article
about
i
believe
some
new
hampshire
politician
failed
to
take
the
traditional
"no
tax"
pledge
and
lost
the
election.
moving
on
to
the
grosjean
case
in
particular,
i
think
the
only
real
case
that
the
star
tribune
has
with
regard
to
grosjean
is
on
this
tax
on
knowledge
issue.
and
yet,
minnesota's
tax
is
simply
not
like
the
british
stamp
tax,
it
is
not
like
the
british
tax
on
advertisements,
which
were
the
only
two
taxes
on
knowledge
that
the
grosjean
court
mentioned
in
its
opinion.
the
star
tribune
virtually
concedes
as
much
in
its
own
brief,
that
it
was
not
a
stamp
tax.
instead,
it
tries
to
bring
it
into
the
same
category
as
the
british
tax
on
paper.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
that
may
be
the
star
tribune's
argument,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
history
of
the
taxes
on
knowledge
would
support
that.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
it
might
be.
but
the
history
of
the
taxes
on
knowledge
does
not
support
that.
all
i
need
do
is
quote
two
passages
from
the
grosjean
opinion
itself,
which
went
into
a
very
great
amount
of
detail
with
regard
to
the
british
taxes
on
knowledge.
in
the
grosjean
opinion
on
page
246
it
says,
and
i
quote,
"the
main
purpose
of
these
taxes
was
to
suppress
the
publications
of
comments
and
criticisms
objectionable
to
the
crown,
does
not
admit
of
doubt.
"
later
on
in
the
same
page
this
court
said,
and
i
quote,
that
"the
taxes
had
and
were
intended
to
have
the
effect
of
curtailing
the
circulation
of
newspapers,
and
particularly,
the
cheaper
ones
whose
readers
were
generally
found
among
the
masses
of
people
went
almost
without
question,
even
on
the
part
of
those
who
defended
the
act.
"
this
is
this
court
talking
about
the
history
of
the
british
stamp
taxes
and
the
british
taxes
on
knowledge.
and
it
may
be
true
that
insofar
as
british
history
is
concerned,
their
import
duty
on
paper...
or
rather,
duty
on
paper...
was
used
with
that
intention
in
mind,
and
also
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
british
taxes
on
knowledge
granted
notoriously
unfettered
discretion
to
the
british
administrations
in
the
collection
of
those
taxes,
thereby
making
them
even
easier
tools
to
use
to
suppress
their
political
opponents.
those
two
facts
together
made
the
british
taxes
on
knowledge
odious
to
american
experience.
of
course,
in
the
case
of
minnesota's
use
tax
on
paper
and
ink,
neither
one
of
those
facts
are
present
here.
there
is
no
intent
to
suppress.
revenue
raising
was
not
given
just
lip
service
in
minnesota;
it
was
the
basic
reason
for
this,
and
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
minnesota
miracle
act
which
was
passed
back
in
1971.
and,
of
course,
there
is
no
unfettered
discretion
in
the
collection
of
the
minnesota
use
tax,
as
well.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
no,
your
honor.
although
it
would
make
it
a
different
case
if,
as
your
honor
says,
this
was
an
exemption.
but
it's
not
an
exemption;
it's
an
exclusion.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
this
court
could
use
the
grosjean
decision
and
invalidate
that
tax,
then.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
at
least
the
legislative
history;
not
necessarily
the
politics,
your
honor.
up
until
this
point,
we've
talked
primarily
about
the
issue
as
it
is
framed
in
terms
of
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
per
se,
and
we
really
haven't
talked
too
much
about
the
equal
protection
issues.
i
would
like
to
take
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
talk
about
the
equal
protection
issues
as
they
arise
here.
i
would
like
to...
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
you
mean
they
passed
a
general
sales
tax
on
all
businesses?
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
closer
case,
your
honor,
and
i
can
only
say
that
it's
not
the
case
here.
and
i
would
hesitate
to
speculate
on
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
that
case.
with
regard
to
the
equal
protection
issue,
this
was
given
some
space
in
the
briefs,
and
i
think
rightly
so.
i'd
like
to
mention
that
our
primary
position
here,
as
it
has
been
throughout
this
litigation,
is
that
the
anti-rational
basis
standard
of
review
is
the
correct
standard
of
review
here
to
use.
this
is
because
the
thing
being
taxed,
the
wholesale
commercial
purchase
of
paper
and
ink,
is
simply
not
a
fundamental
right
so
closely
connected
to
actual
communicative
acts
that
it
requires
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
review.
there's
certainly
no
more
of
a
fundamental
right
than
the
star
and
tribune's
purchase
of
gasoline
or
tires
for
its
delivery
trucks,
which
are
subject
to
the
excise
tax,
or
its
purchase
of
desks
and
reporters,
desks
and
typewriters
for
its
reporters,
which
has
always
been
subject
to
sales
and
use
taxation
in
minnesota
in
any
event.
any
business
that
buys
desks
and
typewriters
for
its
people,
for
its
employees,
has
to
pay
sales
tax
on
those
desks
and
typewriters.
this
is
simply
an
incidental
burden,
an
incidental
item
of
overhead,
just
like
those
other
incidental
items,
that
any
commercial
business
has
to
absorb
in
the
state
of
minnesota
and,
indeed,
in
all
other
states.
therefore,
we
feel
that
it's
sufficiently
remote
from
actual
communicative
acts
so
that
where
we
don't
deny
that
it
may
have
some
effect
upon
first
amendment
interests,
it
is
not
a
fundamental
effect
invoking
strict
scrutiny.
but
having
said
that,
i
think
i
still
want
to
go
on
and
talk
about
how
this
case
can
meet
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
review
in
any
event,
because
if
it
meets
strict
scrutiny,
it
certainly
meets
the
anti-rational
basis
standard.
all
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
review
requires
is
that
there
be
a
legitimate
and
important
government
purpose
served
by
a
statute
which
is
sufficiently
tailored
so
as
to
achieve
that
purpose
without
unduly
restricting
first
amendment
interests
and
actual
communicative
acts.
now,
the
original
and
basic
use
tax
in
this
case
is
so
tailored.
it
serves...
it
was
enacted
in
1971
to
serve
an
important
and
fundamental
governmental
interest,
which
is
revenue
raising
for
an
important
social
program,
and
it
is
sufficiently
tailored
so
as
to
get
as
far
away
from
the
actual
communicative
act
of
printing
and
publishing
a
newspaper
as
possible,
and
at
the
same
time
achieve
its
revenue-raising
purpose
by
taxing
the
wholesale
purchase
of
paper
and
ink.
as
for
the
$100,000
exclusion,
of
course,
our
first
position
there
is
that
it's
a
benefit
anyway,
and
it's
a
benefit
that
applies
equally
and
across
the
board
to
all
publications.
in
fact,
the
star
and
tribune,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
during
the
years
in
question
it
had
two
editions,
the
morning
edition
and
the
evening
edition,
it
received
two
exclusions,
getting
a
benefit
of
$8,000
off
its
tax
bill.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i
don't
recall
the
actual
level
now
in
minnesota,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--it
was
at
9
cents
or--
it
was
for
anything
less
than
9
cents
you
did
not
have
to
pay
a
sales
tax.
and
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
still
correct
but
there
was
a
level
at
a
small
level
like
that
where
it
cuts
in.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
i
know
they
are,
your
honor.
i
buy
mine
all
the
time
at
25
cents
a
copy.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
there
was
a
compelling
reason,
in
any
event,
for
the
$100,000
exclusion.
even
assuming
that
it
was
discriminatory
and
was
not...
and
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
that
compelling
reason
being
that
there
was
an
equitable...
that
a
need
for
an
equitable
system
of
taxation
that
took
into
account
the
special
problems
of
small
newspapers.
and
the
legislature
achieved
that
by
a
tailored
technique;
namely,
an
exclusion
rather
than
an
exemption.
an
exclusion,
a
tax
credit,
if
you
will,
that
was
given
equally
and
across
the
board
to
all
papers.
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
a
small
newspaper,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
most
small
newspapers,
your
honor,
are--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--yes,
your
honor.
they
had
a
hard
time
paying
this,
they
had
less
of
an
ability
to
pay,
they
were
mainly
located
in
rural
areas,
had
a
smaller
circulation
and,
therefore,
had
less
chance
for
advertising
revenues.
there
are
any
number
of
reasons
that
the
legislature
could
have
drawn
on
in
order
to
give
a
special--
mr.
paul
r.
kempainen
--yes,
your
honor.
but
it
was
also
a
financial
break...
i
wish
to
emphasize...
that
was
equally
applicable
to
the
large
newspapers
and
the
large
publications.
in
summary,
what
we
have
here
is
a
simple
revenue-raising
statute.
it's
non-content
related,
it's
not
a
license
tax,
it's
not
tied
directly
to
circulation,
and
it
was
not
imposed
with
any
improper
purpose,
least
of
all
a
suppressive
one.
whatever
classifications
there
are
in
that
statute,
they
were
imposed
with
a
view
towards
benefiting
first
amendment
interests
and
for
being
solicitous
toward
then
and
not
with
a
view
towards
suppressing
first
amendment
interests.
whether
the
anti-rational
basis
standard
of
review
is
used
under
equal
protection,
we
contend
that
it
should
be
the
correct
standard,
or
whether
the
strict
scrutiny
standard
of
review
is
used,
as
the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
below,
this
statute
meets
the
requirements
of
equal
protection.
it
is
also
not
violative
of
the
grosjean
case
or
any
other
principles
under
the
first
amendment
per
se.
accordingly,
we
feel
that
the
law
is
constitutional
and
respectfully
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
be
affirmed.
