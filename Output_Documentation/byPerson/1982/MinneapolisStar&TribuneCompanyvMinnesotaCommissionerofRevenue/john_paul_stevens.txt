mr.
brown,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question.
if
you
assume,
contrary
to
your
position,
that
a
sales
tax
on
newspapers
would
be
permissible,...
uniform
as
to
all
comparable
businesses...
why
then
is
a
use
tax,
which
is
less
burdensome
and
designed
to
replace
the
sales,
then
why
is
that
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
leaving
out
the
exemption
for
a
moment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question...
i
may
not
have
followed...
on
what
a
publication
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
as
i
understood
the
statute,
the
term
"publication"
is
defined
just
to
include
newspapers.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
that
encompass
west?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
come
out
a
lot
faster
than
that,
as
far
as
i
can
see.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
term
a77
of
the...
i
guess
i
just
must
have
just
misread
it.
i
thought
it
just
covered
newspapers
and
supplements
and
enclosures
with
the
newspaper.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
that
really
is
irrelevant,
isn't
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
your
position
is
right,
you
could
have
imposed
the
full
4
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
suppose
instead
of
an
$8000
credit
or
a
$4000
credit,
you
gave
them,
say,
a
$25,000
credit.
then
there'd
be
only
two
or
three
papers
that
would
pay
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
illinois
they
have
a
practice
of
exempting
all
counties
under
500,000
from
a
lot,
which
is
a
way
of
legislating
about
chicago.
and
i
suppose
you
could
do
the
same
sort
of
thing
here
with
an
exemption
of,
say,
$35,000.
it's
perfectly
neutral
on
its
face,
but
people
wouldn't
have
much
difficulty
figuring
out
who
would
have
to
pay
the
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
my
question?
do
you
think
if
you
did
raise
the
exemption
as
i
suggested,
it
would
still
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
if
the
exemption
or
the
credit,
whatever
you
call
it,
instead
of
being
$4000
was
$35,000,
so
the
only
two
left
were
the
papers
in
minneapolis
and
st.
paul.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
let
me
just
explore
your
argument
for
a
moment.
supposing
that
in
1974,
when
you
passed
the
exemption,
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
a
change
in
control
of
the
legislature.
i
don't
happen
to
know
anything
about
minnesota
politics,
but
suppose
all
the
rural
districts
where
these
smaller
newspapers
are
mostly
published
happened
to
elect
people,
and
they
then
passed
an
exemption
for
the
newspapers
that
supported
them,
and
that
could
be
shown.
would
that
make
it
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
go
back
to
71.
suppose
the
original
tax,
it
could
be
shown
that
the
governor
and
the
majority
of
the
legislature
were
opposed
by
the
principal
newspapers
who
would
bear
the
burden
of
the
tax,
and
in
their
campaign
they
explicitly
said,
we
think
the
newspapers
ought
to
pay
their
fair
share
of
the
public
burden
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
and
then
there
was
a
political
debate
on
the
issue.
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
have
to
get
into
the
politics
of
the
particular
state
to
know
whether
a
tax
of
this
kind
is
bad
or
not,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
just
one
other
question
about
this
motive
problem.
assume
we
had
a
totally
non-discriminatory
sales
tax;
that
this
tax
that
was
put
into
effect
was
one
that
just
treated
newspapers
exactly
like
all
other
businesses,
so
there
was
no
singling
out.
but
it
was
also
clear
that
the
reason
for
doing
it
was
that
the
legislature
didn't
like
the
dominant
paper
in
the
state.
would
that
be
bad,
too?
how
controlling
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
absolutely
not
discriminating,
but
for
a
political
motive.
when
is
motive
controlling?
i
just
wonder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
isn't
really
quite
right.
we
did
have
a
case
from
minnesota,
the
fairmont
creamery
case...
that's
not
the
name
of
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
they
found...
there
was
a
trial
court
finding
on
the
motive
there.
