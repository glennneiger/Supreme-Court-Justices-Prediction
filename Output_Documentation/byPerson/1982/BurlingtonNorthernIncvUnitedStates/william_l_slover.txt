mr.
william
l.
slover
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
city
of
san
antonio,
one
of
the
respondents
in
this
case.
in
their
arguments
on
brief
and
in
their
presentations
to
the
court
this
morning
the
petitioners
and
the
federal
respondents
raised
three
separate
and
distinct
allegations
of
error
in
connection
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below.
first,
they
contend
that
the
decision
violates
the
principles
which
this
court
has
enunciated
in
the
line
of
decisions
beginning
with
arrow
and
culminating
recently
with
conrail.
they
contend
the
decision
violates
those
principles
whether
or
not
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order
was
restored
or
not.
secondly,
they
assert
that
the
court
erred
in
finding
that
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order
had
continued
in
effect.
finally,
they
charged
that
the
court
below
erred
in
its
decision
in
that
it
violated
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
now,
in
the
time
allotted
to
me,
and
hopefully,
in
quite
a
bit
less,
i
am
going
to
try
to
respond
to
each
of
those
three
arguments.
but
before
i
do,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
one
aspect
by
way
of
factual
background;
and
that
is,
the
significance
of
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order.
it
has
a
very
practical
significance
to
my
client
because
it
has
been
the
only
constraining
force
against
runaway
rail
prices
during
the
nation's
energy
crisis.
and
secondly,
it
is
extremely
critical
to
this
litigation
because
all
of
this
voluminous
record...
and
indeed,
we
submit,
this
very
action
before
the
court
today...
is
one
of
a
series
of
unceasing
efforts
by
the
railroads
to
extricate
themselves
from
the
constraint
of
the
order.
so
as
we
go
through
each
of
these
arguments,
we
submit
that
the
very
distinguishing
feature
is
the
san
antonio
i
order
itself.
and
in
that
connection,
this
case
is
a
very
unique
case
in
the
sense
that
very,
very
little
railroad
transportation
takes
place
under
prescribed
rates.
a
statistically
immeasurable
amount
of
transportation
has
taken
place
with
rate
restrictions
in
virtually
very
little
experience
in
successive
orders.
so
you
have
here
a
very
unusual
situation.
now,
as
i
say,
the
basic
allegation
of
error
is
that
the
court
below
violated
this
court's
rules
in
wichita
and
conrail.
and
those
rules,
very
generally
speaking,
divide
the
functions
between
the
judiciary
and
in
this
case
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
draw
a
line
of
demarcation
where
this
court
has
suggested
that
the...
that
the
laws
and
the
policy
of
the
congress
have
ousted
the
federal
judiciary
from
taking
injunctive
action.
and
their
basic
allegation
asserts
that
the
court
below
crossed
over
this
forbidden
line
into
this
forbidden
territory
in
its
decision.
now,
i
think
i
have
fairly
stated
what
they're
saying.
but
how
the
court
did
it
is
not
nearly
as
clear.
and
what
they
have
done
or
what
they
are
seeking
in
this
court
to
do
is
to
stretch
and
expand
the
principles
and
boundaries
that
exist
today
in
the
arrow
line
of
decisions.
and
basically,
they're
very
easily
stated.
in
arrow
and
scrap
the
court
concluded
that
the
federal
courts
should
not
take
injunctive
action
prior
to
the
time
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
acted
finally.
and
in
wichita
and
conrail
they
concluded
that
the
court
should
not
take
intrusive
injunctive
action
where
the
icc
has
acted
finally
but
the
court
reverses
or
remands
that
action.
so
we
have
a
body
of
law
that
ousts
the
federal
judiciary
from
taking
preclusive
or
injunctive
action
in
these
ratemaking
areas.
now,
of
course,
here
there
isn't
any
injunction.
so
what
my
opponents'
case
comes
down
to
is
this
word
"affects".
they
are
asking
you
here
today
to
buy
the
affects
test.
they
are
saying
when
a
reviewing
court
reaches
an
action
which
affects
rates,
then
that
should
be
discouraged
in
the
same
way
that
overt
injunctive
action
is.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
i
think
we
would
all
agree,
as
the
court
said,
that
the
effect
of
its
action
was
the
same.
but
the
distinction,
as
we
see
it,
is
that
unlike
the
wichita
case,
here
the
court
was
doing
something
that
it
was
eminently
qualified
to
do:
it
was
construing
an
order.
and
the
considerations
which
caused
this
court
to
oust
the
judiciary
in
wichita
and
conrail
are
in
to
way
applicable
to
the
construction
of
orders.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
this
court's
decision
and
the
arizona
grocery
case
is
dispositive
on
that
point,
that
neither
the
commission...
in
other
words,
for
example,
the
commission
itself
could
not
have
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
said,
we
have
examined
this
initial
rate
and
we
find
that
at
some
point
in
the
past
it
became
unsatisfactory,
so
we
are
going
to
set
a
rate
for
the
future
and
also
adjust
for
the
past.
that
process
could
not
have
taken
place
with
or
without
the
district...
the
cicruit
court
action.
so
the
rate
prescription
order
can
never
be
retroactively
adjusted
under
the
rulings
of
this
court
and
arizona
grocery.
mr.
william
l.
slover
that's
correct.
the
arizona
grocery--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--it
was
the
other
situation.
mr.
william
l.
slover
that
is
exactly
what
that
case
says.
mr.
william
l.
slover
so
the
difficulty
that
we
have
with
the
so-called
affects
test
that
they're
striving
to
extend
conrail
beyond
injunctions
is
that
none
of
the
considerations
which
bothered
the
court
in
conrail...
in
other
words,
when
a
court
enters
an
injunction,
it
has
to
decide,
one,
who
is
going
to
win
on
the
merits
or
the
probability
of
success;
and
secondly,
irreparable
injury.
now,
in
conrail
the
court
said
that
the
federal
courts
should
not
be
engaging
in
these
type
of
considerations,
which
in
the
first
instance
should
initially
be
considered
by
the
commission.
they
felt
that
the
injunctive
process
was
intrusive
upon
the
commission's
area
of
expertise.
but
there's
no
expertise
in
this
case.
the
court
simply
construed
a
rate
order,
an
order
which
this
court
has
held
has
the
force
of
a
statute.
none
of
the
considerations
behind
conrail
apply
to
a
judge's
or
a
circuit
court's
construction
of
a
rate
order.
so
we
submit--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--i...
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
know
that
they
had
the
order
before
it.
this
court
has
said
that
rate
orders
are
unique,
they
have
the
force
of
statute,
they
speak
for
themselves.
and
indeed,
at
that
particular
time,
there
was
not
the
controversy
which
has
been
generated
after
the
fact.
so
we
submit
that
this
court
was
eminently
qualified
to
construe
a
rate
order,
and
that
is,
in
fact,
what
it
did.
mr.
william
l.
slover
i
simply
don't
know
that
i
would...
that
i
would
go
that
far.
i...
i
think
that
they
had
the
rate
order
in
their
hand,
and
it
said,
this
order
shall
remain
effective,
et
cetera,
until
modified.
they
had
vacated
the
modification.
and
again,
i
feel
that
the
court
was
not
taking
injunctive
action
or
any
of
this
type
of
activity
that
this
court
has
precluded,
but
rather
was
simply
engaging
in
the...
in
the
uniquely
judicial
process
of
interpreting
and
construing
an
official
document.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
in--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
let
me
say
about
the
filed
rate.
first
of
all,
i
would
disagree
with
my
colleague
in
connection
with
his
response
to
justice
o'connor
that
this...
this
theory
was
ever
really
broached
to
the
court
below.
but
as
to
the
filed
rate
doctrines,
so
to
speaks,
i
think
that's
really
a
bad
rap
against
the
court
below.
the
more
that
i
thought
about
this
arguments,
the
more
i
began
to
think
that
the...
that
the
court
below
and
judge
wilkie
never
got
into
whether
we
were
paying
too
much
or
too
little
or
who
had
to
pay
whom.
the
filed
rate
doctrine
deals
with
the
railroads
collecting
charges
in
tariffs
and
possibly
our
paying
charges,
et
cetera.
wilkie
never
talked
about
that.
wilkie
talked
about--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--the
priority--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
it--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--i
absolutely
do
not.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
i
think
that
the...
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
very
clear
because
the
provision
section
107601
that
requires
the
carriers
to
file
the
rates
is
subject
to
the
exception
that
where
there
are
outstanding
rate
orders,
they
have
to...
they
are
forbidden
from
publishing,
charging,
or
collecting
any
other
rate
but
the
rate
in
the
order.
so
we
simply
say
that
the...
that
the
statutory
source
of
the...
of
the
rate
filing
in
this
statutory
scheme
is
preempted
by
another
part
of
the
statute.
and
indeed,
that
is
exactly
how
we
read
arizona
grocery.
arizona
grocery
says,
when
you
have
the
rate
order,
you
have
to
obey
it;
you
can't
throw
tariffs
in
the
front
door
that
has
some
other
rate
and
then
have
a
lawsuit
as
to
whether
that
was
right
or
wrong.
mr.
william
l.
slover
which
the
court
of
appeals
vacated.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
we...
the
liability--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--of
the
tariff--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
it
was.
and
again,
justice
o'connor
mentioned
whether
we
had
filed
a
complaint,
and
indeed
we
did
file
a
complaint
about...
about
that.
and
it
continues
to
languish
at
the
commission
today.
it
was
never
acted
upon.
but
we
took
every
action.
we
do
not
control
this
pricing.
they
control
these...
these--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--that's
what
we
would
submit.
we
would
submit
that
the...
because
the
order
continued
in
full
force
and
effect,
the
railroads
who
control
this
pricing...
in
other
words,
they
control
the--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--absolutely.
mr.
william
l.
slover
yes,
we
would
submit
that,
or
an
exception.
and
while
we
are
on
the
filed
rate
doctrine--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
l.
slover
they
could
not
have.
the
other
thing
about
the
filed--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--yes.
we
submit
that
the...
that
the...
that
the
tariffs
become
secondary
under
the
statutory
scheme
to
the
rate
order.
the
rate
order,
under
this
court's
decision
and
arizona
grocery,
is
the
equivalent
of
a
statute;
it
is
a
much
higher--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--yes.
we...
we
submit
that
they
could
not
have
filed
tariffs
in
excess
of
the
san
antonio
i
rate.
mr.
william
l.
slover
they
could
have
filed
one
after
san
antonio,
but
we
take--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--that
the...
that
the
order
is
in
effect;
you
either
file
at
the
order
or
the
order
supplants
the
tariff.
mr.
william
l.
slover
they
have
to
conform
their
tariff
to
that
order,
which
at
that
point
was
the
only
viable
order.
the
additional
point
i
want
to
make
on
this
filed
rate
doctrine,
which
i
persist
is
a
sort
of
an
add-on
to
this
case,
is
that
all
of
these
cases
deal
ultimately
with
who
has
to
pay
what
at
the
end
of
the
litigation.
i
am
not
certain
that
any
of
them
or
there
is
any
particular
body
of
law
that...
that
says
that
we
have
to
pay
up
first
and
argue
later.
they
have
a
case
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
texas
to
get
the
filet
rate.
and
really,
i
think
what
their
proposition
comes
down
to
here
is
that
somehow
we
have
to
pay
first
and
argue
later.
and
i
am
not
so
certain
that
even
if
you
came
and
found
that...
that
the
rates
they
file
are
the
filed
rates
and
they
have
to
charge
them,
that
we
have
to
pay
them
pending
the
litigation.
so--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--i...
i
do
not
see
it
as
that,
no.
mr.
william
l.
slover
we
believe
that
if
you
have...
in
other
words,
there
are
cases
that
if
you
have
loss
and
damage,
if
your
goods
are
set
off,
that
you
can
set
off--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--then
we
submit
that
we
could...
we
could
withhold
payment
pending
litigation.
yes,
that
would
be
our
position,
that
if
the
rate
is--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
in
many
of
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
the
brief,
that
is
what
in
fact
took
place.
i...
we
have
cases
where,
not
in
this
court,
your
honor...
but
there
are
cases
where
the
issue
of
what
has
to
be
paid
pending
the
litigation
is
discussed,
and
they
appear
not
to
require
that
we
pay
and
then
argue.
mr.
william
l.
slover
yes.
mr.
william
l.
slover
yes,
your
honor,
but
not
retroactively.
mr.
william
l.
slover
but,
your
honor,
that's
a
critical
distinction
in
this
case.
they
cannot
go
backwards
on
the
rate
order.
mr.
william
l.
slover
and
so
while
it's
true--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
of
course,
at
the
time
this
litigation
came
up,
as
you
mentioned
in
the
direct
arguments,
the
commission
was
taking
our
position.
mr.
william
l.
slover
they
had
attempted
to
file
tariffs,
and
they
did
take
the
position
that
we
espouse;
namely,
that
tariffs
in
conflict
with
the
rate
order
could
not
be
filed.
now--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
they
were
filed,
but
we
consider
them
to
be
null
and
void--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--but
they...
we
concluded
that
they
were
null
and
void
because
they
were
in
conflict
with
the
outstanding
rate
order.
now,
as
i
say,
the
real
heart
of
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
the
final
analysis,
as
we
read
it,
comes
down
to
a
series
of
efforts
to,
in
essence,
make
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order
go
away.
but
if
you
make
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order
go
away,
then
you
don't
have
to
extend
conrail,
you
have
conrail.
without
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order,
there
isn't
any
question
that
the
court
below
would
have
taken
the
prohibitive-type
interference.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
as
we
see
it,
if
you
reverse
the
court
of
appeals,
you
would
have
to
also
reverse
yourself
in
arizona
grocery.
that's--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
as
you
understand,
this...
this...
this
proceeding
is
going
on
in
various
continuing
facets,
and
i
presume
that
if
you
were
to
reverse,
this
disputed
period
would
become
part
of
that
ongoing
proceeding.
but
i
am
speculating.
the...
as
i
was
saying,
the--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
as
mr.
justice
white
mentioned,
i
think
that's...
the
arizona
grocery
situation
is
something
of
the
reverse
of
this
situation
where
the
commission
prescribed
a
higher
rate--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--and
then
they
prescribed
a
lower
rate.
mr.
william
l.
slover
right.
mr.
william
l.
slover
and
they...
they
tried
to
get
the
carrier
to
ante
up
the
difference--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--to
lower--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--down
the
difference
of
the
second
shipment.
mr.
william
l.
slover
right.
mr.
william
l.
slover
correct.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
in
both
cases
this...
well
in
the
arizona
case
and,
as
we
submit,
the
fact,
the
situation
in
this
case,
the
rate
order
cannot
be
retroactively
adjusted.
and
so
in
arizona--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
we...
we
claim
that
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order
is
the
only
legitimate
valid
rate
order
that's
stood
the
test
of...
of
administrative
procedure
and
was
sanctioned
by
a
reviewing
court.
i
recognize
that
the
record
and
the
briefs
are
laced
with
these
opinions
about
its
interim
nature
and
its
temporal
nature.
but
the
interstate
commerce
act
doesn't
provide
for
temporal
orders
or
short-term
orders;
it
just...
it
just
requires
orders.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
we
take
our
actions
in
many
ways
were
guided
by
this
court's
discussion
in
arizona
grocery
where
it
said,
where
the
commission
prescribes
a
rate,
it
speaks
in
its
legislative
capacity,
and
it
says
$10,
and
that
$10
must
govern.
the
carriers
cannot
take
their
pricing
freedom
and
try
$15,
throw
it
in
the
front
door,
file
a
tariff
as
you
will,
make
us
pay,
make
us
litigate
and
take
their
chances.
they
say
that
the
$10
prescription
governs.
and
that
is
fundamentally
what
our
position
boils
down
to
before
this
court
this
morning,
that
at
the
completion
of
the
activities
of
the
circuit
court,
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order
stood
in
full
force
and
effect,
continued
as
judge
wilkie
found.
and
that
order
set
a
specific
rate,
and
under
this
court's
ruling
in
arizona,
that
is
the
only
legal
lawful
rate,
and
they
cannot
vary
it
by
filing
tariffs
or
by
any
other
means.
their
relief
was
not
to
engage
in
this
withering
array
of
lawsuits
and
legal
actions
and
maneuverings,
but
to
go
back
to
the
commission
and
seek
to
act
upon
the
circuit's
mandate
just
as
they
did
when
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
eighth
circuit.
they
went
back,
and
they
made
their
case
to
try
to
modify
the
prescription.
and
that
would
have
been
their
best
course
of
relief
following
the
action
of
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
william
l.
slover
yes.
mr.
william
l.
slover
yes.
in
other
words,
as...
as...
thinking
about
that
here,
in
other
words,
if
you
reverse...
if
you
reverse
wilkie...
or,
to
state
it
differently,
what
we
contend
happens
at
the
end
of
the
circuit
court's
activities
is
that
the
price
constraint
continues.
these
people
are
continued
under
the
regulatory
rate
ceiling,
and
they
seek
a
result
that
at
the
end
of
the
circuit
court's
action
the
ceiling
is
gone,
they
are
back
to
voluntary
pricing.
so
taken
on
balance,
if
you
were
to
reverse
the
d.c.
circuit,
you
would,
in
essence,
be
restoring
pricing
freedom
to
these
railroads
over
our
traffic
because
there
wouldn't
be
any
constraining
rate
orders
at
all.
mr.
william
l.
slover
correct.
and
indeed,
the
day
after
the
circuit
court
was
open
to
them,
the
circuit
court
never
interfered
with
anything
that
the
icc
could
have
done--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--no,
it
leaves,
i
think,
the
time
period
is...
is
about
six
or
seven
months
or
eight
months.
it
is--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--i
believe
the
figure
has
been
computed
at
approximately
$19
million.
i
never
figured
out,
i
don't
contest
it.
as
you
perhaps
appreciate,
the
numbers
in
these
coal
rate
cases
are...
are
very,
very
enormous.
so
if
you
were
to
affirm
the
court
below,
the
effect
of
your
holding
would
be
that
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order
continued
until
the
commission
finally
vacated
it
back
in
april
of
1981.
the
last
point
that
i
shall
make
very
briefly
is
that
the
most
understandable
part
of
the
presentation
of
my
opponents
is
this
facade
of
how
they
get
the
san
antonio
i
rate
order
to
self-destruct
or
to
have
been
lifted
or
vacated.
and
i
simply
want
to
say
that
the
record
in
this
case
before
the
commission
shows
that
the
railroads
were
intensely
trying
to
vacate
the
order,
to
lift
it,
to
get
out
from
under
this
pricing
constraint.
and
we
were
resisting
it
steadfastly
throughout
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
and
so
to
come
before
this
court
now
and
say
that
the
existence
of
this
order,
which
is
of
such
critical
significance
to
this
litigation
and
to
my
clients
is
metaphysical
or
semantical
really
belies
the
fact.
everybody,
including
the
circuit
court
and
the
commission,
were
acutely
aware
of
the
distinction
between
vacating
or
lifting
an
order
and
modifying
it.
and
we
submit
that
no
case
can
be
made
on
the
facts
of
this
record
that
the
san
antonio
i
order
somehow
had
gone
out
of
existence
before
it
got
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
we
had
some
doubts
about
it,
but
those
doubts
did
not--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--no.
mr.
william
l.
slover
we're
really--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--well,
that
issue
is
pending
at
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
to
what
the--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--they
are
now--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--it
was
vacated.
mr.
william
l.
slover
and...
no,
it...
we...
we
take
the
position
that
that
be
the
ceiling
until
it
was
properly
vacated.
and
the
commission
vacated
it
last
may.
mr.
william
l.
slover
they
were
permitted
to
get
to
work
on
that
the
afternoon
of
judge
wilkie's
decision.
nothing
that
the
circuit
court
did
in
any
way
interfered
with
that.
our
difficulty
was
that
we
felt
that
the
process
that
led
to
the
vacation
might
have
been
a
little
summary.
but
fortunately
that's
not--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--that
is
correct.
mr.
william
l.
slover
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
slover
we
would
have
argued
that
they
could
not
have.
we
would
have
suggested
and
contended,
as
we
did
before
the
fifth
circuit,
that
something
in
the
nature
of
the
defective
hearing,
that
wilkie
found
difficulties
with,
should
have
been
reheard.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
i
guess
the
question
there
is
one
of
how
much
they
could
have
done.
they
in
fact
did
do
something
very
summarily,
and
that
has
clearly
been
accepted
by
the
courts.
so
my
answer
to
your
question,
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight,
is
that,
yes,
they
could
have
acted
expeditiously.
and
indeed,
your
honor,
the
railroads
could
have
asked
the
d.c.
circuit
not
to
vacate
the
order.
as
we
point
out,
many
of
the
litigants
in
these
rate
cases
come
before
the
circuit
court
and
say,
it's
a
lousy
order,
but
don't
vacate
it;
we
need
it
for
the
duration.
mr.
william
l.
slover
well,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
commission's
position
is
a
little
like
a
chameleon
here.
at
one
time
their
position
was
as
ours
is
and
at
another
time
they
took
the
position
that
they
had--
mr.
william
l.
slover
--right.
mr.
william
l.
slover
that's
correct.
thank
you.
