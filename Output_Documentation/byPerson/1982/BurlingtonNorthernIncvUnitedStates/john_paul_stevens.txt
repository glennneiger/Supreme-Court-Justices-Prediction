justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment
just
to
refresh
my
recollection
on
the
appealability
question,
the
jurisdictional
question
as
to
whether
it's
timely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view,
could
they,
the
railroads,
have
immediately
refiled
the
existing
tariffs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
have
filed
any
tariff
above
the
san
antonio
i
rate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
they
could
not
have
exceeded
the
san
antonio
i
rate,
under
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
just
is
no
room
for
a
filed
tariff;
it
wouldn't
have
done
any
good
to
file
another
tariff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no;
why
would
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
i
know
you
rely
heavily
on
arrizona
grocery,
but
isn't
that
a
case
in
which
the
court
held
that
reparations
could
not
be
granted
when
the
rate
had
previously
been
determined
to
be
lawful
by
the
commission
and
the
commission
later
changed
its
mind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
the
shipments
had
already
taken
place,
pursuant--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
the
first
rate
which
had
been
approved
before
the
shipment
took
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
think
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
shipper
sued
for
reparations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
their
claim
was
disallowed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
why
is
that
inconsistent
with
your
position
here...
i
mean
with
the
position
of
your
opponents
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
after
it
has
been
finally
approved
by
the
commission
then.
but
here
we're
not
doing
that,
are
we?
i
mean
we
are
not
being
asked
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
your
argument.
i
am
just
not
quite
clear
on
why
the
arizona
rate
case
provides
you
as
much
support
as
you
think
it
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
consequences
of
an
affirmance?
you
don't
take
the
position
that
the
may
7th
order
of
the
commission
where
they
allowed,
pursuant
to
which
you
have
been
paying
the
higher
rate,
that
that
was
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
what
i
am
really
asking
is
if
you
were...
are
you
entitled
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--recover
the
excess--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
over
the
san
antonio
i
rate
for
the
period
subsequent
to
may
7,
'81?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
one
possible--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--consequence
of
your
view
would
be
that
the
revival
of
the
san
antonio
i
rates
required
that
that
be
the
ceiling
until--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
consistent
in
your
view,
with...
they
were
permitted
to
do
that
under
the
court
of
appeals
mandate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
for
purposes
of
our
analyzing
your
argument
here,
we
can
assume
that
you
accept
the
validity
of
the
may
7th
action
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
7,
'81,
action
of
the
commission?
