mr.
robert
eden
martin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
may
it
please
the
court:
october
of
1976
the
interstate
commerce
commission
prescribed
a
rate
of
$10.93
per
ton
applicable
on
coal
moving
from
wyoming
to
san
antonio,
texas.
its
action
in
the
so-called
san
antonio
i
case
was
an
interim
measure
to
get
the
coal
moving.
and
the
eighth
circuit
sustained
it,
in
part,
on
the
basis
that
it
was
temporary.
now,
in
reopening
the
1978
the
commission
in
the
san
antonio
ii
case
modified
its
prior
order
by
eliminating
the
prior
rate
prescription
and
imposing
a
rate
ceiling
of
$16.12
a
ton.
this
is
not
the
prescription
of
a
particular
rate
but
a
ceiling;
that
is
to
say,
a
maximum
level.
the
commission's
decision
at
0.18
of
the
appendix
makes
it
clear
and
says,
"it
is
not
in
any
sense
a
requirement
that
the
railroads
increase
their
rates
on
this
traffic
to
any
particular
level.
"
following
that
decision
the
railroads
did
in
fact
file
a
tariff
at
the
$16.12
level.
then
on
petition
for
administrative
review
in
1979
in
san
antonio
iii,
the
commission
modified
its
decision
and
set
a
higher
rate
ceiling
of
$17.23.
now,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
railroad's
obligation
to
collect
and
the
shipper's
obligation
to
pay
the
rate
derives
not
from
the
commission's
order
establishing
any
particular
ceiling
but
from
the
fact
that
the
rate
was
filed
in
a
tariff
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
if
the
tariff
were
less
than
the
ceiling,
then
the
tariff
is
what
the
shipper
would
pay,
not
the
ceiling.
now,
following
san
antonio
iii,
the
railroads
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
d.c.
circuit
on
the
ground
that
the
ceiling
was
arbitrary,
capricious,
and
unlawfully
low.
and
san
antonio
also
appealed,
contending
that
the
decision
was
arbitrary
and
that
the
rate
that
resulted
was
too
high.
the
d.c.
circuit
in
its
first
decision
in
june
of
1980
concluded
that
the
commission's
san
antonio
iii
rate
ceiling
was
arbitrary,
it
lacked
adequate
rationale,
and
the
cost
findings
were
not
adequately
supported.
the
entire
decision
in
june
of
1980
dealt
with
the
new
ceiling
and
whether
it
was
adequately
explained
and
supported.
the
court
did
not
in
that
decision
discuss
at
all
whether
the
1978
decision
of
the
commission
to
lift
the
1976
prescription
was
proper.
the
only
question
was
the
validity
of
the
new
ceiling
and
whether
it
was
rationally
supported.
now,
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
commencing
with
shipments
moving
on
july
24,
1980,
san
antonio
quit
paying
the
tariff
rate
and
commenced
paying
at
a
level
of
$15.83
a
ton,
which
it
calculated
to
be
the
old
1976
interim
prescription
increased
by
general
rate
increases
that
had
occurred
since
that
time.
and
from
july
24,
1980,
to
may
7
of
1981,
when
they
resumed
paying
at
the
tariff
level,
the
difference
between
the
tariff
that
was
in
effect
and
on
file
at
the
commission
and
the
rates
that
they
actually
paid
amounted
to
approximately
$20
million.
now,
after
they
quit
paying
at
the
tariff
level
and
after
other
attempts
to
compel
them
to
pay
at
that
level
failed,
the
railroads
petitioned
the
d.c.
circuit
to
clarify
that
its
decision
with
respect
to
the
icc
orders
in
san
antonio
ii
and
iii
did
not
affect
the
railroads'
tariffs
that
were
on
file
at
the
commission.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
well,
i
think
not,
because
we
were
in
a
position
in
the
fall
in
which
we
were
not
getting
our
tariffs
paid,
and
we
had
to
do
something
to
clarify
the
problem.
and
we
believe
that
under
wichita,
the
court's
decision
in
1980
had
not
acted
to
revive
the
prior
rate
prescription;
it
had
not
had
any
effect
at
all
with
respect
to
our
tariffs.
we
thought
that
the
quickest
way
of
getting
a
resolution
of
that
issue
was
to
go
back
to
the
d.c.
circuit;
hopefully,
they
would
rule
that
their
order
related
only
to
the
commission's
orders
and
not
to
the
railroads'
tariffs.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
well,
we
did
go
before
the
commission
virtually
simultaneously.
we
did,
in
fact,
file
a
tariff
again
at
the
san
antonio
iii
level.
in
other
words,
we
believed,
as
we
told
the
courts,
that
our
tariff
on
file
had
not
been
invalidated
by
our
revived
order,
but
just
in
case
it
had
and
to
be
careful,
we
filed
a
new
tariff
at
exactly
the
same
level
and
went
to
the
commission
and
said,
allow
this
to
become
effective
if,
in
fact,
it's
necessary
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
yes,
yes,
we
did.
that...
there
were
about
four
or
five
railroad
submissions
to
the
d.c.
circuit
on
clarification.
i
can't
give
you
a
page
reference,
but
it
was
in
there.
now,
the
effect
of
the
court's
clarification
in
june
of
1981...
this
is
the
second
d.c.
circuit
order...
was
to
construe
its
earlier
1980
decision
as
requiring
the
railroads
to
roll
back
their
tariff
to
the
san
antonio
i
level
pending
further
proceedings
before
the
commission.
and
the
court
then,
rather
than
the
commission,
decided
what
the
railroads'
rate
should
be
during
the
course
of
the
remand
proceedings.
we
believe
that
that
decision,
both
with
respect
to
the
revival
of
san
antonio
i
and
the
"unlawfulness"
of'
the
railroads'
tariff
is
in
error.
now,
first
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
authority
of
a
reviewing
court,
we
believe
that
under
this
court's
decisions
in
arrow,
scrap,
wichita
board,
and
most
recently,
conrail
v.
nary,
the
commission
has
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
decide
what
the
level
of
the
rates
or
the
tariffs
should
be
and
whether
particular
rates
or
tariffs
violate
provisions
of
the
act
or
prior
icc
regulations
or
rulings.
we
believe
that
reviewing
courts
have
no
power
to
determine
what
the
rates
should
be.
the
court's
function
is
to
review
and,
where
appropriates
set
aside
commission
orders,
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
setting
aside
or
passing
on
the
validity
of
the
carrier's
tariffs.
now,
conrail
v.
nary
is
the
most
recent
decision
of
this
court
on
point.
in
that
case
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
had
vacated
an
icc
order
that
had
established
maximum
rates
on
recyclables
equal
to
180
percent
of
variable
cost.
the
court
had
gone
beyond
invalidating
the
order
and
also
ordered
that
carrier
rates
filed
pursuant
to
180
percent
ceiling
must
be
revoked.
and
this
court
summarily
reversed,
holding
that
the
commission's
failure
to
adequately
support
the
180
percent
ceiling
did
not
mean
that
the
ceiling
or
rate
set
at
that
ceiling
were
"rejected
outright".
as
this
court
pointed
out,
rates
up
to
that
ceiling
might
eventually
prevail
at
the
commission.
there
was
thus
no
basis
for
that
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals
order
which
had
gone
beyond
striking
down
the
order
and
invalidating
the
carriers'
tariffs.
now,
that
case
is
squarely
on
point
in
rejecting
the
proposition
that
the
function
of
a
reviewing
court
is
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante,
which
is
what
the
district
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did.
the
function
of
the
reviewing
court
is
not
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante;
it
is
to
allow
the
commission
on
remand
to
decide
the
validity
of
the
carrier's
rates.
now,
that
is
very
close
to
what
happened
in
this
case,
where
the
commission's
san
antonio
iii
decision
establishing
a
rate
ceiling
was
set
aside
because
the
rationale
was
not
adequate.
but
the
court
of
appeals'
first
decision
in
1980
left
open
the
possibility
that
rates
at
that
same
level
might
eventually
prevail
after
the
commission's
proceeding
on
remand.
the
problem
is
that
if
the
court's
1981
decision,
which
is
here
on
review,
is
valid,
it
would
mean
that
for
some
interim
period
of
time
the
old
1976
temporary
rate
would
apply
and
no
matter
what
the
commission
might
decide
on
the
remand,
the
carriers
could
never
recover
their
tariff
rate
for
that
interim
period.
now,
the
court
below
recognizes
these
consequences
of
its
decision,
but
it
in
effect
blames
them
on
the
revived
1976
order
of
the
commission.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
wichita,
nothing
in
conrail
v.
nary
which
suggests
that
the
holding
of
those
cases
depended
on
whether
the
commission
had
issued
one
order
or
two
orders
to
10
orders.
so
long
as
the
tariff
rate
might
eventually
prevail
on
remand
before
the
commission,
than
the
reviewing
court
has
no
power
to
interfere
with
the
tariff.
we
believe
that
is
the
holding
of
conrail
v.
nary.
now,
this
limitation
on
a
reviewing
court's
power
would
apply
even
if
san
antonio
i
had
been
revived.
in
fact,
the
commission
in
1976
had
clearly
intended
that
the
order
be
temporary,
to
get
the
traffic
moving.
this
is
in
the
appendix
at
e-13
and
f-2.
and
by
its
own
terms
the
'76
order
had
life
only
"until
the
further
order
of
the
commission.
"
and
such
a
further
order
was,
in
fact,
issued
in
1978.
thus
by
its
own
terms
the
original
1976
order
ceased
to
have
any
effect
two
years
before
the
period
in
question
here.
but
even
more
fundamentally,
the
commission
did
not
bring
the
1976
order
back
to
life
in
1980
or
in
1981.
the
commission
has
never
ruled,
never
found,
that
a
reasonable
maximum
rate
for
1980-81
would
be
at
the
san
antonio
i
level.
in
fact,
in
its
april
1981
decision
the
commission
concluded
that
the
san
antonio
i
rate
was
f-4
in
the
appendix;
and
"cannot
have
continued
validity
because
of
the
new
statutory
threshold
on
icc
maximum
rate
jurisdiction
and
because
of
the
changed
statutory
standards
since
1976.
"
that
is
at
f-8
in
the
record.
so
the
question
really
is
where
an
agency
rate
order
which
was
temporary
in
the
first
place
expires,
where
the
agency
has
not
itself
brought
the
order
back
to
life
and
where
the
agency
in
fact
believes
that
the
old
order
is
out
of
date
and
wrong
and
would
not
be
revived
if
it
was
up
to
the
commission,
can
a
reviewing
court
bring
it
back
to
life
for
the
period
of
the
remand?
mr.
robert
eden
martin
no,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
for
that
is--
mr.
robert
eden
martin
--no.
no,
your
honor,
because
the
reason
for
that
is
because
of
the
interrelationship
between
the
tariffs
which
are
on
file
and
the
maximum
rate
orders.
the
commission
can
fully
protect
everyone,
and
that's
the
difference.
where
you've
got
a
will
and
another
will,
what
do
you
do
in
the
meantime?
well,
you
don't
have
that
problem
in
the
icc
or
in
other
statutory
situations
that
are
built
on
the
interstate
commerce
act
because
there's
a
tariff
there,
and
if
the
tariff
turns
out
to
be
have
been
too
high,
the
commission
can
award
reparations
and
protect
everybody.
in
other
words,
if
we
had
a
$20
tariff
on
file
and
the
commission
ultimately
concluded
it
wasn't
$15,
it
was
$17.50,
that
would
have
been
a
fair
maximum
reasonable
rate
for
that
interim
period
of
time.
the
commission
isn't
stuck
with
the
alternative
of
either
the
$20
or
the
$15.
it
can
say,
$17.50
was
the
maximum,
pay
the
reparations
back
to
the
$17.50
to
make
the
shipper
whole
for
the
excess
of
the
tariff
during
that
period,
and
pay
them
interest.
it
can
do
that,
and
it
has
done
that.
now,
what
it
cannot
do
is
authorize
the
railroads
to
go
back
and
once
its
tariff
has
been
reduced,
collect
more.
in
other
words,
if
our
tariff
was
reduced
from
$20
to
$15
for
an
interim
period
of
time
and
the
commission
later
concluded
that
it
really
ought
to
have
been
$20
or
$22
or
$13
or
anything
above
that
there's
no
power
to
authorize
the
railroads
to
go
back
and
retroactively
collect
that
higher
amount
from
the
shipper.
but
the
reason
that
the
will
situation
really
isn't
analogous
is
because
of
the
commission's
flexibility
to
determine
what
between
the
$20
and
the
$15
is
a
fair
rate
and--
mr.
robert
eden
martin
--well,
what
would
happen
is--
mr.
robert
eden
martin
--the
commission
wouldn't
enter
a
tariff.
the
carriers
go
file
a
tariff,
and
the
tariff
becomes
the
rate
that
has
to
be
paid
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it's
filed.
and
what
the
commission
would
do
is
look
at
the
tariff
and
say
is
that
too
high
or
unlawful
for
any
reason.
now,
if
after
having
locked,
it
says
that
that
$20
tariff
is
too
high,
we
hereby
order
the
railroads
to
reduce,
and
then
two
things
happen:
for
the
future,
once
the
tariff
is
reduced,
that
reduced
tariff
becomes
the
rate
that
the
shipper
has
to
pay,
and
so
for
the
future
we
are
taken
care
of.
now,
the
question
is,
what
do
you
do
about
the
past?
and
if
the
$20
ought
to
have
been
$17.50,
the
shipper
is
protected
by
the
reparations
and
the
interest
on
the
reparations.
but
the
problem
we've
got
is
that
if
when
an
order
is
set
aside
that
had
approved
a
higher
rate,
the
effect
of
that
order
is
automatically
to
invalidate
not
only
the
order
but
our
tariff
and
make
our
tariff
unlawful
for
some
period
in
the
past
and
it
gives
the
commission
no
opportunity
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
not,
then
we
are
stuck
because
there's
nothing
we
can
do
for
that
interim
period
of
time,
and
here
it
was
nine
months
and
$20
million.
now,
the
problem
here
is
not
simply
one
of
exceeding
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
orders.
it
interferes
directly
with
the
statutory
ratemaking
scheme
because
you
have
a
period
of
rising
costs
and
changing
regulatory
standards.
it
is
not
at
all
uncommon
for
the
icc
or
other
regulatory
agencies
to
issue
a
succession
of
rate
orders
that
will
reflect
successively
higher
maximum
rates,
which
is
what
happened
here.
under
this
ruling,
whenever
one
such
order
is
set
aside
on
review,
the
last
prior
lawful
order
would
bounce
back
into
effect,
revived
for
some
period
of
time.
and
that
would
happen
no
matter
how
outdated
the
prior
order
was.
and
here
it
was
1976
to
1980.
and
it
would
apply
no
matter
how
inconsistent
that
revived
order
is
with
the
changed
statutory
standards.
and
here
we
had
two
new
statutes
that
had
come
into
effect.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
it
said
that
it
was
not
based
on
its
own
intent
or
subjective
determination
as
to
what
the
rate
level
should
be,
and
it
said
that
it
was
the
effect
of
its
order.
it
did
not
go
into
the
question
of
what
the
commission
intent
was
in
1976
or
what
the
commission's
intent
would
be
in
1980.
it
simply
ruled
in
a
more
or
less
mechanical
way,
without
looking
at
anybody's
intent,
on
the
rates
involved.
but
the
problem
here
is
not
only
that
time
has
passed
but
that
in
1976
the
commission
passed
a
new
rule
of
ratemaking,
10704(b)(2)
of
the
statute.
that
was
not
applied
in
the
1976
first
order
because
that
proceeding
was
in
midstream
by
the
time
the
act
was
passed.
but
it
was
a
brand-new
rule
of
ratemaking.
then
again
in
1980
the
staggers
rail
act
changed
the
ratemaking
standards
some
more.
and
the
problem
is
that
that
san
antonio
i
rate,
which
goes
back
to
1976
and
was
intended
to
be
temporary
and
interim
in
the
first
place,
doesn't
begin
to
reflect
those
changed
regulatory
standards.
now,
i
might...
i
might
just
go
to
the...
well,
i
see
that
my
light
is
on.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
no,
ma'am,
they
did
not.
they...
their
position
with
the
tariff
integrity
board
was
that
our
tariff,
which
was
on
file,
ought
to
be
rejected
because
it's
inconsistent
with
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
in
the
tariff
integrity
board
letter
from
mr.
geezenboter,
which
is
in
this
supplemental
brown
volume
of
documents,
rejected
that
and
said
there
has
been
no
order
of
the
commission
directing
that
the
tariff
be
rejected
or
reduced.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
no,
they
did
not.
they
took
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
had
given
them
the
relief
they
wanted;
they
didn't
have
to
go
to
the
commission.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
i'd
just
like
to
address
a
couple
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised.
first,
with
respect
to
where
the
filed
rate
doctrine
was
raised
in
our
papers
before
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
first
argument
section
of
the
petition
for
clarification
that
we
filed
in
november,
pages
11
through
12.
this
is
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
i'd
like
to
address
the
chief
justice's
question
with
respect
to
what
happens
if
we
reverse
or
if
we
don't
reverse.
if
there
is
a
reversal,
our
argument
would
be
that
everybody
is
protected
because
the
entire
matter
of
what
happens
to
a
rate
from
1978,
when
san
antonio
ii
came
down,
to
the
present
and
through
tomorrow
will
be
before
the
commission.
the
commission
will
rule
on
what
would
have
been
a
reasonable
maximum
rate
throughout
that
entire
period
and
can
protect
everybody,
including
san
antonio.
the
problem
is,
what
happens
if
you
don't.
and
here
we
have
from
1978--
mr.
robert
eden
martin
--from
1978
to
'79,
the
san
antonio
ii
level
was
charged.
from
'79
until
'80,
the
san
antonio
iii
level
was
charged.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
yes.
july
'80.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
because
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
maximum
rate
that
the
railroads
charged
from
'78
to
'80
was
the
question
that
was
before
the
commission
in
san
antonio
iii.
it
went
before
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
d.c.
circuit
remanded
it
and
it's
still
on
remand.
so
i
think
this
is
very
important.
before
the
commission
right
now
there
is
a
proceeding
in
which...
it
is
ongoing.
the
commission
will
some
day
decide
what
would
have
been
a
maximum
reasonable
rate
for
this
entire
period.
if
it
finds
that
the
rate--
mr.
robert
eden
martin
--no,
if
that's
what
he
said
he's
wrong,
because
the
problem
is
with
respect
to
the
hole
in
the
middle.
the
whole
1978
to
the
present
and
the
issue
of
the
maximum
rate
is
before
the
commission
right
now.
but
if
san
antonio
is
right,
then
there
is
a
chunk
of
that
period
from
july
of
1980
to
may
of
1981
in
which
the
commission
would
not
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
what's
a
maximum
reasonable
rate.
so
the
commission
could,
according
to
his
theory,
find
that
the
san
antonio
ii
level
was
okay
from
'78
to
'79,
the
san
antonio
iii
level
was
okay
from
'79
to
80.
but
there's
a
dip
for
nine
months
in
which
the
commission
has
no
power
to
do
anything
because
of
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision.
and
then
from
may
of
'81
on,
again
jurisdiction
would
revert
to
the
commission
to
find
what's
a
maximum
reasonable
rate.
our
theory
is
that
there's
no
hole,
that
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
period.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
the
carrier's
tariff
is
on
file
today,
your
honor.
back
in
may
of
1981
the
commission,
in
the
decision
that
is
in
the
brown
book
at
5,
restored
pricing
freedom
to
the
carriers.
mr.
robert
eden
martin
if
you
reverse,
we
will
be
able
to
go
back
and
collect
from
them
for
that
interim
period
of
nine
months
our
tariff.
and
then
if
the
commission
decides
that
the
tariff
was
too
high
for
that
period
or
any
other
portion
of
this
four-year
period,
it
can
require
us,
yes,
sir,
to
pay
reparations
and
to
pay
interest.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
the
point
that
was
made
about
san
antonio
i
being
the
only
constraining
force
on
the
railroads
and
you
have
to
somehow
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
because
it's
the
only
constraining
force.
that
just
isn't
right,
because
from
1978
to
'80
it
didn't
exist
and
it
doesn't
exist
today.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
appendix
f-11,
which
is
where
the
may
7,
1981,
order
appears.
and
as
of
that
date
and
that
order,
san
antonio
i
on
everybody's
theory
is
gone,
everybody's.
and
judge
wilkie
acknowledged
it
in
his
decision
at
a-6.
so
that
is
gone,
and
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
period
to
implement
the
standards
of
the
act,
and
the
only
question
is
whether
there's
a
nine-month
chunk
in
the
middle
of
that
period
over
which
it
has
no
jurisdiction
and
over
which
it
has
no
alternative
except
to
restore
a
rate
which
it
believes
is
out
of
date
by
years,
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
standards.
again,
a
brief
reference,
at
f-7
and
f-8
of
the
record.
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
what
the
commission's
intent
is,
at
least
today,
because
we
know.
in
may
of
1981
it
got
out
this
decision,
in
which
it
said
that
the
san
antonio
rate
is
supported
neither
by
current
cost
data
or
current
legal
standards,
or
at
least
that
there's
no
reason
to
believe
it
is,
and
that
not
even
san
antonio
contends
that
its
evidence
would
ultimately
justify
reimposition
of
the
san
antonio
prescription.
this
is
the
commission
in
may
of
'81.
it
says
that
the
san
antonio
i
rate,
if
restored,
would
be
way
below
even
the
threshold
for
commission
maximum
rate
jurisdiction,
and
a
rate
of
that
kind
"cannot
have
continued
validity".
this
is
at
f-8
of
the
record.
so
we
know
what
the
commission's
view
is
in
the
wake
of
the
remand.
we
know
what
the
commission's
view
is
in
1980-81.
we
don't
have
to
speculate
about
it.
