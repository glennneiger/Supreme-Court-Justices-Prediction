justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
any
order
entered
or
any
mandate
handed
down
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
respect
to
judge
wilkie's
opinion,
or
does
his
opinion
stand
simply
alone
on
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
not
the
petition,
but
judge
wilkie's
opinion
is
here,
of
course.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
an
order
was
entered.
it
probably
is
in
these
papers
somewhere,
but
i
just
haven't
seen
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
mandate
from
which
an
appeal
is
taken;
i
guess
that's
my
question.
