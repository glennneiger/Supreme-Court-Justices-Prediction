mr.
martin,
did
the
railroads
argue
below
that
the
cadc
should
not
declare
the
tariffs
unlawful
because
the
san
antonio
failed
to
comply
with
the
filed
rate
doctrine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
martin,
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me
before
you
sit
down.
and
that
is,
san
antonio
apparently
applied
in
october
of
1980
with
the
tariff
integrity
board
challenging
the
tariffs,
in
effect.
now,
did
san
antonio
appeal
from
the
order
that
resulted
from
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
san
antonio
ever
actually
file
a
complaint
with
the
commission
or
just
something
with
the
board?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
thank
you.
