justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
didn't
think
so
initially,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
did
it
think
that
it
was
being
usurped
but
that
it
would
just
knuckle
down
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
its
attitude
wasn't
that
that
was
proper?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
its
position,
however,
that
the
court
had
overstepped
its
authority,
or
did
it
take
a
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
conrail
wasn't
the
first
case
of
this
genre,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
way--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
the
rate
proves
too
low,
the
railroads
can
never
go
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
about
the
filed
rate
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
i
guess
there
was
a
tariff
outstanding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
may
not
have.
he
may
not
have,
but
is
it...
it
may
not
have
ever
been
posed
there,
but
it's
posed
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
that
it's
properly
posed
here
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
assume
we
disagree
with
you.
how
do
you
respond
to
the
filed
rate--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
the
tariff
was
filed
pursuant
to
another
rate
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
tariff
was
still
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
tariff
was
still--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
railroad
supposed
to
do
when
the...
after
the...
is
it
supposed
to
withdraw
that
tariff
or
file
a
new
one
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
the
net
effect
then
of
the
court
of
appeals
order
was
that
it
required
the
railroads
to
file
a
new
tariff?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that's
not
contrary
to
the
filed
rate
doctrine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
they
have
to
file
tariffs.
and
your
point
is
they
should
have
filed
the
tariff
and
had
to
file
a
tariff
at
the
san
antonio
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
court
of
appeals
left
open
the
possibility
that
the
san
antonio
ii
and
iii...
is
that
what
you
call
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
san
antonio
ii
and
iii
rates,
or
the
san
antonio
iii
rates,
could
be
reestablished
by
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
the
possibility
was
that
those
rates
would
be
reestablished
and
that
the
commission
would
have
said,
that's
what
they
always
should
have
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
but
they
can
leave
in
effect...
the
commission
could
leave
in
effect
that
tariff.
now,
when
a
railroad
files
a
new
tariff,
the
commission
can
suspend
it
if
it
wants
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
on
the
remand,
if
the
commission
wanted
to,
it
could
have
suspended
that
tariff.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
already
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
never
ordered
them
suspended
or
revoked
or
withdrawn.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could,
that
afternoon
without
a
hearing
or
anything
else,
could
the
commission
have
amended
its
san
antonio
i
order
to
the
extent
that
it
just
permitted
the...
well
could
it
just
have
withdrawn
it
that
afternoon?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
they
could
have
done
something
to
the
order
that
would
have
permitted
the
railroads
to
file
new
tariffs
immediately?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
commission's
position
now
is
that
the
railroad
tariffs
that
were
filed
based
on
san
antonio
iii
are
still
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
some
point
in
this
proceeding
the
commission
took
the
position
that
the
railroad
tariffs
that
were
on
file
were
the
governing
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
in
effect
saying
the
railroad
should
be
permitted
to
file
a
new
tariff
at
the
san
antonio
iii
level.
justice
byron
r.
white
wait
a
minute,
now.
what
can
the
commission
do,
you
say?
what
rates
have
been
charged
up
'til
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
'80.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
commission
cannot
get
the
railroads
to
give
up
any
of
those
collected
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
doesn't
agree
with
that.
i
understood
him
to
say
that
if
we
reversed
there
was
no
way
that
a
reasonable
rate
could
be
set
for
this
interim
period.
