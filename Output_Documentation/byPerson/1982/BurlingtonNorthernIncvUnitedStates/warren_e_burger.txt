burger
mr.
martin,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
commission
procedures
is
there
any
practice
parallel
to
the
one
in
probate
matters
of
a
dependent
relative
revocation
so
that
when
a
subsequent
order
is
set
aside,
it
revives
the
last
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
they
ever
ordered,
have
they
ever
done
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
under
the
new
tariff
that
nullified
any
prior
tariff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of
the
commission
now,
not
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
schulder.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
slover.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
the
court
of
appeals
action,
however,
equivalent
to
something
like
an
injunction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
assume
that
ultimately
it
is
found
that
their
action
was
correct.
why
wasn't
the
proper
approach
to
it
to
let
these
rates
remain
in
effect,
adjust
whatever
equities
might
be
found
by
reparations?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assume
hypothetically
that
this
court
reverses
the
court
of
appeals.
what
is
the
posture
of
the
carrier
with
respect
to
the
san
antonio
i
rates
that
are
being
charged?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
lay
that
aside
for
the
moment.
we
will
decide
that
later.
but
what
is
the
posture
of
the
carrier
if
we
reverse?
what
do
they
do
about
having
only
the
$11
rates
all
this
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
try
again.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
were
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
vacate
its
judgment,
then
is
san
antonio
iii
rate
structure
the
prevailing
rate
for
this
whole
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
then
san
antonio
i
rates
are
applicable
and
it's
open
to
them
to
try
to
get--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
martin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
the
status
quo
ante
is
restored,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
they
recover
from
san
antonio
the
shortfall
in
the
interim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
burlington
northern
incorporated
and
others
against
the
united
states
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion,
a
unanimous
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
court
this
morning
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
reversed.
