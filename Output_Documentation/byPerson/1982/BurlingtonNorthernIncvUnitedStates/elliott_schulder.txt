mr.
elliott
schulder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
agree
with
petitioners
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case
violates
the
rule
against
judicial
ratemaking
established
in
this
court's
wichita
and
conrail
decisions.
the
decision
below
basically
interferes
with
the
commission's
exclusive
authority
to
determine
proper
rates,
and
it
reaches
an
inequitable
result.
san
antonio
has
argued
that
wichita
and
conrail
are
distinguishable
because
they
do
not
involve
successive
rate
orders.
but
the
effect
of
the
court's
holding
in
earlier
icc
order
revived
in
declaring
inconsistent
tariff
rates
unlawful
is
precisely
the
same
as
if
the
court
had
directly
enjoined
the
railroads
from
collecting
tariff
rates
during
the
period
in
question.
in
either
situation,
the
commission
is
precluded
from
making
its
own
determination
of
the
proper
rate
levels.
the
court
of
appeals
remand
decision
left
open
the
possibility
that
the
san
antonio
rate
level
would
prevail.
now,
under
the
teaching
of
wichita
and
conrail
on
the
proper
role
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
situation
should
have
been
to
preserve
the
agency's
authority
to
determine
what
rates
are
reasonable
for
the
period
on
remand.
however,
the
court,
rather
than
preserve
the
commission's
authority,
essentially
has
usurped
the
authority
of
the
commission
by
declaring
the
tariff
rates
unlawful
during
the
period--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
commission--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
commission's
initial
position
was
that
the
legal
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
remand
decision
was
to
revive
the
san
antonio
i,
the
earlier
commission
order--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--its
attitude
was
that
that
would
create
an
inequity
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
try
to
correct
the
inequity.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
i
don't
believe
it
took
a
specific
position
on
that.
however,
after
this
court's
decision
in
conrail
came
down,
the
commission
changed
its
position
and
affirmatively
told
the
court
of
appeals
that...
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
incorrect.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
conrail
was...
conrail
was
the
first
case
in
which
a
majority
of
this
court
held
that
a
reviewing
court
has
no
authority
at
all
with
which
to
set
rates
or
determine
rate
policy
in
the
context
of
a
remanded
proceeding.
now,
the
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
overstepped
its
bound
under
wichita
and
conrail
we
feel
is
also
supported
by
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
if
we
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
the
only
tariff
that
was
on
file
during
the
remand
period
at
issue
here,
the
10-month,
9
or
10-month
period
at
issue,
was
the
tariff
filed
at
the
san
antonio
iii
level.
there
was,
in
fact,
no
tariff
on
file
governing
the
movements
in
question
at
the
level
of
san
antonio
i.
yet
during
the
entire
period
in
question
here,
san
antonio
paid
only
the
rate
at
the
san
antonio
i
level.
the
court's
decision,
by
declaring
tariff
rates...
tariff
rates
here
unlawful
has
rewarded
san
antonio's
resort
to
self-help
and,
in
effect,
sanctioned
san
antonio's
violation
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
the
filed
rate
doctrine
has
its
origins
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
requires
shippers
to
pay
and
carriers
to
collect
only
filed
tariff
rates.
if
a
shipper
believes
that
a
filed
tariff
rate
is
unlawful
either
because
it's
inconsistent
with
the
commission
rate
order
or
for
any
other
reason,
the
proper
remedy
is
to
challenge
the
filed
rate
before
the
commission.
and
if
the
commission
at
that
point
finds
the
rate
unlawful,
it
may
award
the
shipper
reparations
for
any
overcharge
and
any
interest.
thus,
the
shipper
is
fully
protected
by
the
statutory
scheme.
san
antonio,
however,
has
argued
that
it
is
excused
from
paying
the
tariff
rate
for
this
period
because
the
act
prohibits
carriers
from
publishing
or
collecting
rates
in
excess
of
those
prescribed
by
the
commission.
but
the
question
here
is
what
rate
the
shipper
must
pay
when
there
is
an
ongoing
dispute
over
whether
the
tariff
rate
is
in
violation
of
the
commission's
order.
it
is
not
up
to
a
shipper
like
san
antonio
or
even
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
a
tariff
rate
is
or
is
not
unlawful.
the
commission
is
not
arguing
here
that
filed
rates
are
automatically
the
lawful
rates
that
govern
a
particular
movement
in
questions
but
that
the
determination
of
lawful
rates
is
for
the
commission
to
make.
the
only
way
to
preserve
the
commission's
authority
to
make
a
determination,
we
submit,
is
to
adhere
to
the
filed
rates
with
the
remedy,
of
course,
of
reparations
in
the
event
the
shipper
wishes
to
file
a
complaint
in
testing
the
validity
of
a
tariff
rate.
thus,
the
purpose
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine
essentially
is
to
provide
a
rigid
rule;
that
is,
the
shipper
must
pay
the
filed
rate
until
the
dispute
over
the
proper
rate
is
resolved
by
the
commission.
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
therefore,
like
the
rule
in
wichita
and
conrail,
preserves
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
rates.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
however,
violates
both
the
wichita
and
conrail
and
the
filed
rate
doctrines.
accordingly,
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
and
those
we
have
stated
in
our
briefs,
the
commission
and
the
united
states
respectfully
request
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
mr.
elliott
schulder
san
antonio
has
raised
the
point
that
the
petition
in
this
case
was
not
timely
filed
because
it
was
filed
in
excess
of
90
days
from
the
court
of
appeals
initial
remand
decision.
however,
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
the
remand
decision
did
not
resolve
the
question
that
is
at
issue
here
and
that
the
court
dealt
with
in
its
june
1981
decision
which
is
before
the
court
now,
the
decision
on
the
petition
for
clarification
of
mandate.
the
earlier
remand
decision
said
nothing
about
whether
or
not
its
order
remanding
the
case
to
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
and
explanations
would
act
to
revive
the
earlier
commission
order.
accordingly,
we
agree
that
there
is
no
question
of
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
do
you
mean
on
the
petition
for
clarification
of
mandate?
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
am
not
aware
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i
am
not
aware
one
way
or
the
other
whether
there
was
a
subsequent
mandate
issued
at
that
point.
thank
you.
