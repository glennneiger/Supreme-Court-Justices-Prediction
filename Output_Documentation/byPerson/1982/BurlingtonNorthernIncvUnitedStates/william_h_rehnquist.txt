justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
regrets
in
having
made
that
decision
to
petition
for
clarification,
mr.
martin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
give
any
consideration
to
going
before
the
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
martin,
was
attempting
to
interpret
commission
intent
in
deciding
the
effect
of
its
previous
order
or
that
its
ruling
as
to
the
effect
of
its
own
decision
or
order
wasn't
based
on
what
it
conceived
to
be
the
intent
of
the
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
did
try
to
determine
what
the
commission
had
intended
by
its
various
san
antonio
orders?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
it
construed
the
rate
order,
i
take
it
then
you
mean
it
construed
the
effect
it
thought
the
commission
would
want
the
rate
order
to
have?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
really
what
the
filed
rate
doctrine
is
all
about,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
you
could
pay
some
other
rate
than
the
filed
rate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
supposing
it's
just
a
disagreement
about
the
reasonableness
of
a
filed
rate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
some
case
in
this
court
that
supports
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that
still
leaves
a
couple
of
years
of
rates
at
the
san
antonio
i
level
long
after
the
san
antonio
i
tariff
was
filed,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
money
would
be
involved?
