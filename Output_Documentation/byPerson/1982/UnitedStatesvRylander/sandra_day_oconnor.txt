o'connor
well,
i
suppose...
doesn't
the
court
have
to,
on
your
motion
to
strike,
simply
strike
the
preceding
testimony
and
the
answer?
there's
nothing
then
in
the
record
in
the
way
of
evidence
that
he's
produced.
isn't
that
the
reality
the
court
must
enforce?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose
the
point
is,
though,
that
if
all
he
says
is
"i
don't
have
them
and
won't
submit
to
cross
examination.
"
then
the
trial
court
has
to
strike
his
statement
that
he
doesn't
have
them.
so
there
is
no
evidence.
that's
why
there
is
no
evidence.

but
a
defendant...
but
a
defendant...
counsel,
in
a
criminal
case
where
a
defendant,
for
instance,
is
charged
with
murder
and
the
only
people
present
at
the
scene
of
the
alleged
murder
were
the
deceased
and
the
defendant,
now,
if
the
defendant
wants
to
plead
the
fifth
amendment
so
he
can't
take
the
stand
and
say
well,
it
was
self-defense,
then
he
risks
going
to
jail
because
he's
convicted
possibly
of
the
offense
charged.
it
puts
him
in
a
tough
position
to
choose,
but
we've
said
he
has
to
make
that
choice.
he
either
gives
up
the
fifth
amendment
and
testifies
fully
and
tries
to
get
off
the
hook,
or
he
pleads
the
fifth
and
perhaps
is
convicted.
now,
how
is
mr.
rylander
in
this
case
in
any
worse
position
than
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
court's
order
didn't
make
clear
that
third
party
witnesses
would
also
suffice,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
your
position
that
that
would
have
sufficed.
