mr.
wallace,
kill
the
hypothetical
case.
suppose
his
answer
truthfully
was
"i
burned
them
up".
he
couldn't
testify
to
that,
could
he,
because
he'd
violate
his
fifth
amendment,
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
know
any
way
out
of
that
problem,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he
takes
the
stand
and
says
"the
reason
i
didn't
produce
them
is
because
i
don't
have
them
and
i
never
had
them.
"
i
don't
know
why
that
is
not
an
adequate
answer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
ask
him
"did
you
ever
have
them",
and--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
then
he
says,
"i
refuse
to
answer
on
the
grounds
it
would
incriminate
me.
"
i
think
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
do
that,
doesn't
he?
doesn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
i
take
the
fifth
amendment--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--well,
i
don't
understand
what
else
he
can
do
after
he
asks
and
says
that
my
answer
would
incriminate
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn't
that
what
he
did
here?
he
said
"i
would
incriminate
myself".
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
law
in...
does
the
law
in
california
say
who
is
to
have
custody
of
corporate
records?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
about
the
only
one
of
the
50
states,
isn't
it,
that
says
that
a
corporation
doesn't
have
to
keep
records?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
whose
possession
are
they
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including...
including
the
president.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
it
presumed
under
california
law
that
this
president
we
are
now
talking
about
did
at
one
time
have
possession
of
those
records?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
agree
that
they...
he
presumed
to
have
had
them
in
'75?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
presume
that
he
violated
the
california
laws?
i'm
talking
about
your
client
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
biggest
rum
running,
dope
peddling
corporation
in
a
state
is
caught
by
irs
or
somebody
and
the
ring
leader
is
subpoenaed
to
bring
in
the
records,
if
we
follow
this
case,
will
his
best
defense
be
to
burn
them
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
in
my
hypothetical
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
wouldn't
that
be
the
normal
thing
for
a
corrupt
law...
not
law-abiding
but
law-destroying
organization
to
do
would
be
the
best
way
would
be
to
burn
them
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
lawyer
would
say
if
you
burn
them
up,
i've
got
a
good
case
that'll
support
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
this
be
a
good
one,
if
we
come
out
your
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is...
i
thought
i
made
it
clear...
this
is
the
only
evidence
they
had.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
so
he
goes
free.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
your
position
that
once
he
says
they're
not,
you
can't
any
questions
about
those
records,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say...
oh,
excuse
me.
but
you
argue...
you
say
they
don't
put
on
prima
facie
evidence,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
isn't
it
prima
facie
when
he
says
"i
don't
have
the
records"?
he
said
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
said
he
didn't
have
the
records.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
admitted
that
the
records
existed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
said
he
didn't
have
them
at
this
time.
didn't
he
infer
that
he
had
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not
get
a
man
for
treason
if
you're
going
to
give
a
hypothetical.
they're
not
talking
about
a
murder.
