chief

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
rylander.
mr.
wallace,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
for
a
moment,
mr....
are
you
finished?
well,
it's...
yes,
i
am.
because
i
gather
you
would
say
it
would
be
different
if
he,
instead
of
submitting
a
written
affidavit
he'd
given
oral
testimony
saying
in
haec
verba
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
holding
in
this
court
that
prohibits
a
judicial
inquiry
into
the
good
faith
of
the
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
done
constantly
in
trial
courts,
isn't
it,
when...
when
there
is
an
apparently
dubious
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
cross
examination
develops
that
there
is
no
basis
for
a
genuine
fifth
amendment
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view
could
he
be
then
asked
and
required
to
answer
"did
you
ever
have
possession
of
them?
"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
talking
about
a
waiver.
i'm
talking
about
a
compelled
answer.
let's
assume
a
hypothetical
now.
the
man
is
put
on
the
stand.
it's
established
by
objective
evidence
other
than
his
testimony
that
at
one
time
he
was
the
secretary
of
the
corporation,
and
then
he's
asked
where
are
these
records.
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment.
then
the
next
question
is
"did
you
ever
have
these
records
in
your
possession?
"
can
that
answer
be
compelled?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
any
explanation
of
how
the
fifth
amendment
protection
is
required
to
explain
whether
he
ever
had
possession
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
harrison.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
has
he
made
any
showing
that
they
don't
exist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
they...
let's
make
this
concrete...
suppose
the
treasurer
of...
or
the
secretary
of
general
motors
corporation
is
called
as
a
witness
and
he's
asked
to
produce
the
minutes
of
the
last
five
meetings
of
the
board.
do
you
think
he
could
get
by
with
this
procedure
you're
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
presumptively
in
charge
of
those
records
unless
he
can
demonstrate
that
he
is
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
the
question
"did
you
ever
have
them"?
can't
ask
him
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
setting
is
different
in
curcio.
take
my
hypothetical,
the
secretary
of
general
motors,
and
let's
enlarge
a
little
bit.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
records
have
been
kept
by
him
up
to
the
last
five
meetings,
the
most
recent
five
meetings,
his
name
on
them,
no
question
about
it.
then
he's
asked
about
the
last
five,
and
he
just
simply
says
fifth
amendment.
is
that
the
end
of
it?
can
no
inquiry
be
made
thereafter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
sure
your
responses
now
are
consistent
with
your
responses
to
me
on
my
hypothetical.
when
i
hypothesized
the
secretary
of
general
motors
and
the
government
showing
that
he
had
traditionally
kept
these
records
and...
up
to
a
point,
put
his
signature
on
them,
all
this
established
so
that
their
existence
and
his
testimony
was
established,
but
then
they
asked
him
a
question
and
he
says
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment,
and
you
say
that's
the
end
of
it.
they
can't
ask
him
when
he
last
saw
them,
if
he
knows
where
they
are,
or
if
he
knows
who
has
them
in
custody.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
given.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
my...
i'm
talking
about
my
hypothetical.
but
you
said
even
the
secretary
of
general
motors
may
just
assert
the
fifth
amendment,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
there
can't
be
any
pursuit
or
cross
examination
beyond
that;
that
that's
an
absolute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
