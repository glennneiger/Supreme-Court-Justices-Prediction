justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
you
say
you
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
he
was
late
making
this.
he
didn't
make
the
same
showing
at
the
original
judicial
enforcement
proceeding.
do
you
rely
at
all
on
the
fact
that
instead
of
getting
on
the
witness
stand,
he
submitted
this
so-called
written
oath?
supposing
he
had
gotten
on
the
witness
stand
and
said
exactly
the
same
thing
he
said
in
the
oath?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
no.
without
cross
examination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
if
he'd
done
what
he
did
in
the
curcio
case,
which
was
get
on
the
stand,
say
i
don't
have
the
records,
and
i
refuse
to
say
why
because
of
the
privilege,
which
is
exactly--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
curcio
case
holds
that
the
claim
of
privilege
is
proper.
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and
but,
therefore,
the
testimony
on...
his
direct
testimony
"i
don't
have
the
record"
is
acceptable
without
subjecting
himself
to
cross
examination.
that's
what
the
case
holds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nonpossession
of
the
records.
justice
john
paul
stevens
curcio
held
squarely
to
the
contrary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
tell
me
what
you
think
curcio
holds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
holds
he...
he
testified
that
he
didn't
have
the
records,
and
then
he
said
i
won't
tell
you
where
they
are
because
i
assert
the
fifth
as
to
the
cross
examination.
exactly
what
this
man
was
doing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
you're
really
disagreeing
again
with
curcio,
because
of
course
that
same
thing
happened
there.
but
what
is
your
understanding,
mr.
wallace,
on
what
will
happen
on
remand
if
the
ninth
circuit
order
were
carried
out?
didn't
they
send
it
back
for
an
investigation
of
the
bona
fides
of
the
fifth
amendment
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
do
you
understand
that
means?
what
will
they
be
doing?
asking
him
the
factual
basis
for
his...
for
his
claim,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
if
i
may.
i...
i
detect
some
change
in
your
position,
too,
i
think.
assume
that
he
proved
that
the
records
were
in
existence
and
in
the
custody
of
your
client
at
the
date
he
was
supposed
to
respond
to
the
subpoena.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
summons...
no,
the
general
motors
example.
and
then
at
the
contempt
hearing,
in
civil
contempt,
not
criminal
contempt...
i
understand
he's
been
held
in
criminal
contempt,
but
that's
not
before
us.
at
the
civil
contempt
hearing
he
gets
on
the
witness
stand
and
says
yes,
it's
true
i
had
the
documents
then.
i
am
now,
however,
unable
to
comply.
they
are
no
longer
in
existence,
something
of
that...
and
he
does
not
explain
why,
and
he
pleads
the
fifth
as
to
the
explanation
of
why.
can
he
be
held
in
civil
contempt,
in
your
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
he
can
be
held
in
civil
contempt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
you
think
that
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
think
under
maggio
that
he
could
be
held
in
civil
contempt
even
though
he
has
testified
under
oath
that
the
documents
no
longer
exist.
