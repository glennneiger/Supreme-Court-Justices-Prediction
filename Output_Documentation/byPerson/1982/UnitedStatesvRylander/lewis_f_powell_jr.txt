f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
i'm
not
quite
sure
yet
that
i
understand
your
position.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
the
individual
here,
the
defendant,
the
suspect
had
simply
taken
the
fifth
rather
than
making
any
effort
to
explain
why
he
didn't
have
the
records
or
even
to
deny
that
he
had
them,
could
he
have
just
said
as
soon
as
you've
made
your
prima
facie
case
i
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
he
would
at
least
have
had
to
bring
in
the...
a
witness,
a
third
party,
for
example,
to
explain
his
situation.
