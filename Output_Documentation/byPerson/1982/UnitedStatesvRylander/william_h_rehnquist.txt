justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
curcio
opinion
would
curcio
have
been
subject
to
cross
examination
on
his
answer
"i
don't
have
the
records"?
you
know,
not
on
the
issue
of
where
they
are
if
you
don't
have
them,
but
on
the
issue
of
does
he
have
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
really...
that
doesn't
really
answer
my
question,
i
don't
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
"i
haven't
brought
the
records.
"
"i
don't
have
the
records.
"
and
concededly,
under
curcio
he
cannot
be
cross
examined
as
to
where
the
records
are
if
you
don't
have
them.
could
he
have
been
cross
examined
consistently
with
the
curcio
opinion
on
his
answer
"i
don't
have
the
records"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
he...
if
he
invokes
the
fifth
amendment
in
response
to
a
question
like
that,
the
district
court
is
entitled
to
weigh
that
invocation
of
privilege
against
him
in
making
a
factual
determination
as
to
whether
he
testified
truthfully
on
the
original
question,
isn't
it?
i
mean
this
is
a
civil
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
you're
saying
is
that
the
government
can't
have...
all
you're
saying
is
that
he
can't
have
his
cake
and
eat
it,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say...
you
say
at
the
contempt
trial
he
said
he
didn't
have
them.
did
he
actually
testify
at
the
contempt
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
said,
"where
are
the
records"?
did
your
client
at
that
hearing
himself
get
on
the
stand
and
say
"i
don't
have
the
records"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
wouldn't
let
himself
be
cross
examined
on
that.
so
that
evidence
goes
out--
--so
that
evidence
goes
out--
--front,
and
there's
nothing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
harbison,
i
just
glanced
over
curcio
again,
and
it
didn't
involve...
the
issue
on
appeal
didn't
involve
production
at
all.
it
involved
criminal
contempt
for
failure
to
answer
questions
for
which
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
claimed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the...
the
court
said
that
the
fact
that
they
were
union
records
and
not
his
personal
records
didn't
mean
that
he
couldn't
invoke
this
privilege
against
self-incrimination
if
questions
about
the
union
records
would
in
fact
incriminate
him.
but
i
don't
see
how
that
bears
on
the
production
issue
here
at
all.
your
client
wasn't
sentenced
for
failure
to
answer
a
question
to
which
he'd
raised
the
privilege.
he
was
sentenced
for
failure
to
obey
the
summons
order.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he's
not
unable.
he's
unwilling.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
this
stage
the
government
has
come
forward
with
enough,
the
government
says,
so
that
your
client
should
take
the
laboring
oar
for
a
while,
and
if
he
refuses,
he's
entitled
to
refuse
under
the
fifth
amendment,
but
he's
not
entitled
to
go
scott-free
of
the
summons
order.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
force
him
to
give
up
anything
because--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
he's
going
to
go
to
jail
under
one
of
two
theories.
it's
really
his
choice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
your
client
make
a
showing...
that
is,
at
a
hearing
where
there's
presumably
the
facts
are
adduced
by
oral
testimony...
if
he
simply
gets
up
and
makes
an
assertion,
albeit
orally,
and
refuses
to
be
cross
examined
on
it.
i
think
justice
o'connor
is
quite
right.
the
government
is
entitled
to
have
that
testimony
stricken.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
discussion...
the
discussion
in
fleischman
was
not
in
the
context
of
anyone
having
taken
a
witness
stand
and
offered
a
partial
explanation.
it
was
in
the
context
of
having
offered
no
explanation,
as
i
read
fleischman.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
utterly
worthless
so
far
as
cross
examination
is
concerned.
well,
it
may
be...
and
it
may
be
worthless,
but
what
if
you
said
well,
yes,
it's
worthless,
but
nevertheless
before
my
client
can
be
held
in
contempt
for
failing
to
produce,
there
must
be...
the
government
must
have
shown
somewhere
in
this
proceeding
that
the...
that
the
records
existed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
of
the
cases
is
the
united
states
against
rylander
which
comes
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
this
case
began
when
the
internal
revenue
service
summoned
rylander
to
turnover
certain
records
containing
two
corporations
of
which
rylander
was
the
president.
rylander
failed
to
comply
with
the
summons
and
the
federal
district
court
issued
an
enforcement
order
demanding
compliance.
ultimately,
the
district
court
found
rylander
in
civil
contempt
and
ordered
that
he
be
jailed
until
he
turned
over
the
records.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
court
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
defendant
in
a
contempt
proceeding
normally
has
the
burden
to
produce
evidence
in
support
of
a
claim,
but
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
where
the
defendant
like
rylander
had
asserted
both
a
lack
of
possession
and
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
the
burden
was
moved
back
to
the
government
to
show
that
the
defendant
posses
the
record.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
a
court
order
enforcing
an
internal
revenue
service
summons
to
produce
records
gives
raise
to
a
presumption
that
a
defendant
in
a
contempt
proceeding
still
possesses
the
records.
to
overcome
this
presumption,
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
coming
forth
with
evidence
showing
a
lack
of
present
possession.
and
the
defendant
cannot
meet
this
burden
by
asserting
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
while
the
privilege
may
prevent
the
court
from
forcing
the
defendant
to
answer
questions
put
by
the
court
or
by
the
government
the
privilege
is
not
a
substitute
for
relevant
evidence.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
