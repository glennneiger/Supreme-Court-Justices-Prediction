justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
i
don't
have
them,
even
if
he
may
not
be
cross
examined
beyond
that,
you
say
that
he
hasn't
made
the
requisite
showing.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you?
don't
you
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
his
uncross-examined...
his
uncross-examined
assertion
is
not...
he
cannot
use
an
uncross-examined
assertion
to
satisfy
his
burden
of
showing
why
he
can't
produce.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
also
say
if
you're
going
to
take
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
make
a
showing,
you're
going
to
have
to
produce
the
records
because
you
just
haven't
made...
unless
you
permit
cross
examination,
you
just
haven't
satisfied
your
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
he
held
in
contempt
for...
failure
to
produce
the
records
or
failure
to
testify?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
judge
had
said,
"look,
i
know
you're
taking...
you're
validly
taking
the
fifth
amendment,
but
you
have
not
made
a
showing.
"
"i
think
the
government
has
made
its
case.
"
"i
know
you
disagree
with
that,
but
the
government
has
made
its
case,
and
you
are
either
going
to
have
to
explain
why
you
can't
produce,
or
you're
going
to
be
held
in
contempt
for
failing
to
produce,
not
for
failing
to
testify.
"
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
curcio.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
certainly
never
made
any
claim
that
producing
the
records
would...
would
violate
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
those--
justice
byron
r.
white
--two
things.
don't
tell
me
there
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
cases
from
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
they...
they...
they
held
him...
want
to
hold
him
in
criminal
contempt
for
failing
to
testify
any
farther.
they
did...
they
carefully
set
aside
the
question
about
production.
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
o'henry
a
case
from
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
harbison,
suppose...
suppose
that...
that...
that
you
would
agree
that...
at
the...
at
the
enforcement
hearing
the
government
made
a
prima
facie
showing
that
the
records
existed
and
that...
and
that
you
would
agree
to
it,
that
that
showing
had
been
made.
then
what
is
your
client's--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
you're...
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
the
government...
that
there's
no
way
the
government
can
come
back
and
meet
its
burden
here
when
he
takes
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
he
has
to
do
is
say
i'm
sorry,
i
just
can't...
i
don't
have
them.
i
can't
produce
them.
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
if
he
took
the
fifth
amendment
then
and
refused
to
say
another
word
and
produced
no
other
evidence,
he
would
be
in
trouble.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
so
when
do
you...
what
do
you
say
the
government
has
to
have
proved,
that
they
were
in
existence
once?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
what
you
really
should
argue
is
that...
is
that
the
turnover
order
was
infirm
in
that
there
never
was
a
requisite
showing
to
substantiate
or
to
support
a
turnover
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it...
do
you
think
the
government...
i'll
ask
the
other
side...
but
do
you
think
the
government
agrees
that
at
some
point
it
has
the
burden
of
showing
existence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
difference
between...
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
only
difference
between
you
two
then
is
whether
the
government
has
made
an
ample
showing
of
possession.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
have,
if
they
have,
you
just
a
while
ago,
i
thought,
indicated--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
your
client
would
have...
could
not
just
take
the
fifth
and
be
quiet.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
isn't
a
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
anything
else.
it's
just
a
question
of...
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
government
made
an
ample
showing
and
satisfied
its
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
a...
it's,
a)
a
question
of
law,
and
it's
also
a
question
of
fact:
is
there
some
kind
of
a
showing
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
still
can't
make
him
answer.
it's
just
that
he
might
be
in--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
might
be
in
jail
for
not
producing.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
you're
defending
everything
that
you
can
find
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
then,
are
you?
do
you
think
the
government,
for
example,
has
to
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
records
are
in
rylander's
possession
or
under
his
control--
justice
byron
r.
white
--are
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not...
that
isn't
what...
that
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying.
and
do
you
think
their
burden
of
proof
is
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
you
think...
do
you
think
that
at
an
enforcement
proceeding
in
connection
with
one
of
these
subpoenas
the
issue
of
presumption
or
existence
comes
up,
that
the
government
then
before
it
gets
a
turnover
order
or
an
enforcement
order
must
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
they
are
then
in
possession
and
control
of
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
can
get
a
turnover,
or
they
can
get
an
order
for
him
to
produce.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then--
justice
byron
r.
white
--an
order
enforcing
the
summons.
and
then
if
he
doesn't
produce
them
and
the
gentleman
comes
in
and
says
"i'm
sorry;
i
don't
have
them.
"
then
the
government
has
to...
has
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
they
are
in
his
possession
and
under
his
control.
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure.
i'm
really
not
sure
what
your
position
is
right
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your...
i
understand
you
think
the
judgment
was
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
wallace,
don't
you...
do
you
think
that
at
some
place
in
this
whole
proceeding
the
government
must
produce
at
least
probable
cause
to
believe
that
these
records
are
in
existence
and
that
he
has
them?
is
that
ever
a
part
of
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right.
then
whatever
it
is
that
you
have--
