mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
from
the
court
of
appeals'
reversal
of
a
judgment
holding
the
respondent
in
civil
contempt
for
noncompliance
with
an
order
enforcing
internal
revenue
summonses.
a
motion
to
expand
the
issues
beyond
those
raised
in
the
government's
petition
was
denied
by
this
court.
briefly,
what
occurred
here
was
a
summons
was
issued
as
part
of
an
investigation
of
respondent's
tax
liabilities
for
the
years
1973
through
'77.
the
summons
called
upon
him
as
president
of
two
real
estate
corporations
to
produce
the
books
and
records
of
those
corporations,
as
well
as
to
testify.
when
he
failed
to
comply,
the
usual
petition
for
enforcement
of
the
summons
was
filed
within
a...
a
supporting
affidavit
by
the
internal
revenue
agent,
and
a
show
cause
order
was
issued
for
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding.
there
were
some
evasions
of
efforts
to
serve
the
order.
those
are
for
the
most
part
more
relative
to
the
criminal
contempt
proceeding
rather
than
the
civil
contempt
proceeding
now
before
the
court,
although
they
could
have
a
bearing
on
the
respondent's
credibility
when
he
did
appear.
eventually
he
was
served
and
directed
to
appear
at
an
enforcement
hearing
held
about
one
year
after
the
summons
had
been
issued,
and
he
was
also
asked
to
respond,
to
put
into
issue
any
issues
that
might
be
controverted.
he
neither
appeared
nor
filed
a
response,
nor
did
anyone
else
appear
on
behalf
of
the
corporation,
although
he
did
prior
to
the
hearing
send
a
letter
to
the
deputy
united
states
marshall
and
to
the
court
in
which
he
claimed
he
was
not
the
president
of
the
corporations
and
had
been
improperly
served.
because
the
government
therefore
anticipated
that
he
might
put
that
issue
into
contest
into
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
it
did
come
prepared
to
make
proof
that
the
corporations
had
been
duly
chartered
with
him
as
a
director
and
had
not
been
dissolved
and
that
he
had
acted
in
banking
and
business
transactions
on
behalf
of
the
corporations.
this
offer
of
proof
was
made
in
his
absence,
and
an
enforcement
order
was
issued,
and
he
was
ordered
to
comply.
and
when
he
failed
to
produce
the
records
upon
meeting
with
the
agent
in
pursuit
of
that,
and
after
other
difficulties
in
serving
him
again,
eventually
a
show
cause
order
for
the
contempt
proceeding
was
served
upon
him
after
his
arrest
pursuant
to
a
bench
warrant;
and
the
hearing
was
held
some
months
later
with
the
respondent
in
attendance.
and
at
that
time
he
again
did
not
testify
or
present
any
evidence,
was...
the
government
attempted
to
further
bolster
its
case
with
some
additional
evidence,
but
that
proved
to
be
unsuccessful
because
the
witnesses
in
one
case
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment,
in
the
other
case
had
nothing
of
value
to
state.
and
the
district
court
held
the
respondent
in
contempt
and
then
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
purge
himself,
whereupon
he
offered
a
written
statement
entitled
"oath
in
purgation
of
contempt",
but
refused
to
testify
or
to
be
cross
examined
on
the
statement
and
did
not
produce
any
other
evidence
in
response
to
the
order.
and
the
district
court
found
that
he
as
president
of
the
corporations
had
possession
or
control
of
the
records
and
had
not
satisfied
his
burden
to
show
that
he
could
not
comply
with
the
summonses
and
failed
to
produce
any
evidence
of
the
contempt
proceeding.
now,
while
our
position
gained
some
strength
from
the
belated
nature
of
the
respondent's
submission
of
this
oath
in
purgation,
as
i
will
explain
for
purposes
of
the
civil
contempt,
our
basic
position
would
be
the
same
if
he
had
made
precisely
the
same
submission
at
the
outset
of
the
summons
enforcement
hearing.
this
court
has
considered
the
showing
that
the
government
is
required
to
make
in
an
internal
revenue
summons
enforcement
proceeding
on
a
number
of
occasions.
the
basic
case,
united
states
v.
powell,
is
of
course
cited
in
the
briefs.
and
if
those
cases
mean
anything
they
mean
that
when
the
government
made
that
showing,
it
is
entitled
to
have
its
summons
enforced
unless...
and
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
does
that
"unless"
mean
in
the
context
of
a
summons
seeking
production
of
corporate
records
from
an
officer
who
would
ordinarily
be
their
custodian,
have
either
possession
or
control
over
them.
and
in
answering
the
question
of
what
the
"unless"
means,
we
look
to,
and
we
think
it's
proper
for
the
court
to
look
to,
cases
involving
not
only
internal
revenue
summons
but
other
forms
of
legal
process
such
as
grand
jury
subpoenas,
congressional
subpoenas,
proceedings
to
direct
a
bankrupt
to
turn
over
his
records
to
a
trustee,
et
cetera.
because
the
issue
is
basically
the
same,
and
the
principle
that
we
draw
from
the
case
law
is
that
when
the
government
has
made
its
requisite
showing,
it
has
established
a
prima
facie
case
that
it's
entitled
to
enforcement,
that
the
order
should
be
complied
with,
and
that
a
burden
of
production
then
shifts
to
the
respondent
to
introduce
some
evidence
of
why
he
should
not
comply.
the
burden
of
persuasion
does
not
shift,
but
a
burden
of
production
shifts
at
that
point
because
the
government
is
not
required
to
anticipate
and
negate
every
possible
defense.
this
is...
this
principle
is
explained
perhaps
most
explicitly
in
an
excerpt
that
we
reproduce
on
page
24
of
our
brief
from
this
court's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
fleischman,
which
happened
to
be
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
involving
a
congressional
subpoena.
but
it
explains
that
the
rule
being
adopted
is
a
rule
affecting
merely
the
time
and
manner
of
proof
rather
than
a
shift
of
the
burden
of
persuasion,
but
it
explains
that
the
prosecution
would
be
under
a
serious
practical
handicap
if
it
must
negate
all
possible
defenses,
and
that
the...
the
relevant
facts
are
peculiarly
within
the
respondent's
knowledge
of
why,
contrary
to
what
one
would
normally
think
of
the
president
of
a
corporation,
he
is
not
in
a
position
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
there
is
sort
of
a
presumption
of
business
regularity,
that
the
person
normally
thought
to
be
in
possession
or
control
of
a
business'
records
would
be
the
person
to
seek
them
from.
this
is
the
way
grand
jury
subpoenas
are
issued,
and
there's
never
any
further
showing
than
that.
then
it's
up
to
that
officer
to
say
why
it
is
that
he
can't
comply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
a
very
different
case.
our
position
is
that
he
submitted
no
evidence
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
what
we're
leading
up
to.
it
wouldn't
have
mattered
whether
he
did
it
at
one
hearing
or
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
he
had
submitted
himself
to
cross
examination--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--oh,
no.
cross--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the...
the...
but
in
the
curcio
case,
the
only
thing
contested
at
the
appellate
level
was
his
refusal
to
testify
rather
than
his
refusal
to
produce
the
records.
and
what
was
upheld
was
his
right
not
to
testify
if
he
claimed
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
the
court
was
very
careful...
and
this
is
one
of
the
cases
that
we
draw
our
principle
from...
to
distinguish
the
question
of
producing
the
records
that
he,
because
he
held
them
in
a
representative
capacity
had
no
privilege
not
to
produce.
and
if
the
requisite
showing
is
made
to
support
the
production
order,
that
is
our
prima
facie
case
that
it
requires
a
burden
of
production
to
shift
to
him
to
show
why
he
can't
produce
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
respect
to
the
testimony
that
the
subpoena
asked
him
for.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with...
with
respect
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--with
respect
to
the...
the
order
in
the
subpoena
requiring
him
to
testify
with
respect
to
the
records.
but
the
case--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--he
would
be
subject
to
cross
examination
in
the
context
of
enforcing
the
order
to
produce
the
records,
if
that
was
the
way
he
chose
to
respond
to
that
order
through
his
own
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i...
i...
i...
i...
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in...
in
our
view
he
could
be
cross
examined
on
both
of
those
issues
in
the
context
of
the
need
to
get
compliance
with
the
order
to
produce
the
records.
he...
he...
he
was
responding...
i
mean
what
was
at
issue
on
appeal
in
curcio
was
the
question
whether
he
had
to
testify
concerning
the
records
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
but
in
order
to
meet
his
burden
with
respect
to
production
of
the
records,
he
doesn't
have
to
take
the
stand
at
all.
he
can
introduce
other
evidence
to
show
that
he
cannot
produce
the
records.
once
the
government
has
made
the
requisite
showing
that
he
is
an
officer
who
ordinarily
would
be
holding
the
records
or
have
them
available
in
his
representative
capacity,
that
is
all
the
government
needs
to
show
in
order
to
get
its
production
order
enforced.
and
then
it's
up
to
him
through
either
his
own
testimony
or
the
testimony
of
third
parties
or
of
other
witnesses
that
he
wants
to
bring
in,
and
compulsory
process
is
available
to
him
to
bring
them
in.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he...
he
has
that
problem.
that
is...
that...
he--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
what
i
think
should
not
be
the
way
out
is
to
have
the
law
reward
him
for
destroying
the
records
when
process
issues
by
allowing
him
through
refusing
to
testify
and
pleading
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
defeat
a...
a
production
order
that
would
otherwise
result
from
the
showing
that
the
government
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all.
precisely
the
contrary.
the
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is...
is...
is
precisely
the
case.
and
even
when
there
is
a
proper
basis
for
a
fifth
amendment
claim...
and
this
is
our
basic
point
here...
what
the
court
has
held
time
and
again
is
that
once
a
witness
chooses
to
offer
testimony
upon
a
fact
that's
been
put
into
issue,
and
in
this
context
upon
whether
he
can
produce
the
records,
if
he
chooses
to
contest
that
through
is
own
testimony,
that
operates
as
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
as
to
matters
reasonably
related
to
that
question,
to
the
question
on
direct
examination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
not
our
view
of
curcio,
because
the
production
question
was
not
what
was
at
issue.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it...
it...
it
holds
that
he
can
refuse
to
testify
in
response
to
the
subpoena
requiring
him
to
produce
and
testify.
we
are
not
in
this
proceeding--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that...
that...
that
is
correct
and...
but
all
i
can
do
is
repeat
that
what
was
contested
was
that
whether
he...
he
responded
adequately
and
waived
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
with
respect
to
the
order
that
he
testified
concerning
the
records.
here
we're
not...
we're
not
trying
to
enforce
the
subpoena
requiring
him
to
testify
in
face
of
his
fifth
amendment
claim
at
all.
we're
just
saying
that
if
he
doesn't
want
to
testify,
he
has
to
make
some
other
showing
of
why
he
can't
produce
the
records.
and
if
he
chooses
to
make
that
showing
through
his
testimony,
then
the
normal
principle
of
waiver
of
cross
examination
with
respect
to
related
matter
has
to
apply.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he...
then
i
think
he
would
be
subject
to
civil
contempt,
because
he
has
done
nothing
to
satisfy
his
burden
of
production.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
made
the
requisite
showing.
then
there
is
a
burden
of
production
on
him.
that
is
the
way
we
read
the
law
and
the
cases.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
i
mean
at...
at...
at
the
least
that
may
not
be
entitled
to
credence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
is
precisely
the
error
that
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
in
this
case.
the
oath
in
purgation
really
was
in
the
nature
of
a
pleaing
of
what
it
is
that
he
could
prove
if
he...
if
he
put
in
his
proof.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
would
be
a
proper
question
on
cross
examination,
and
that
if
he
chose
to
testify
on
the
subject
he
would
have
waived
that.
he
would
have
waived
any
effort
to
find
out
from
him
what
became
of
the
records.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
rather
doubt
it,
not
in
the
face
of
this
fifth
amendment
claim,
because
it
could
be
a
step
in
the
chain
of
proof
against
him.
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that...
that...
that
might
be
a
proper
inquiry
into
whether
he
has
a
basis
for
the
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
yes,
that
is
correct
also.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
precisely
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position.
that
is
our
position,
that
he
has
produced
nothing
except
something
that's
in
the
nature
of
a
pleading
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
giving
any
evidentiary
weight
to.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it...
it...
it
may
well
be,
but
it
would
be
subject
to
the
test
of
cross
examination.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
might
ask--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
then
we...
we
might...
he
might
still
not
satisfy
his
burden
with...
with
that
kind
of
testimony.
that's
a
pretty
thin
showing
for
a
president
of
a
corporation
to
make
with
respect
to
corporate
records.
and
he's
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
fact
that
he's
taken
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
require
the
district
court
to
give
credence
to
his
testimony
prior
to
his
taking
the
fifth
amendment.
if
anything,
it
detracts
from
the
credibility
of
his
prior
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that...
that
is
up
to
him.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
what
else
he
can
do.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
here
he
didn't
submit
himself
to
any
cross
examination
whatsoever.
he
refused
to
take
the
stand.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
i
mean
under
the
district...
under
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
he
has
been
put
in
a
stronger
position
than
a
forthright
witness
who
got
on
the
stand
and
who
submitted
himself
to
examination
by
the
government,
and
whose
credibility
was
undercut
by
the
government's
cross
examination,
and
who
was
disbelieved
by
the
district
court.
the...
the...
here
someone
who
refuses
to
take
the
stand
at
all
and
couples
this
written
statement,
which
he
tries
to
get
weighed
as
evidence,
with
a
plea
of
the
fifth
amendment
has
been
put
into
an
impregnable
position
in
comparison
with
a
forthright
witness
who
does
take
the
stand.
now,
that
can't
be
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
they
didn't
really
specify.
and,
you
know,
my
surmise
is
really
no
better
than
anyone
else's
on
that.
i
don't
see
what
else
would
be
at
issue.
there
might
be
a
further
effort
made
by
the
government
to
bolster
its
proof,
but
our
position
is
that
we've
already
introduced
more
than
is
necessary
under
the
powell
case
and
others
that
spell
out
what
our
requisite
showing
is
in
the
absence
of
some
production
of
evidence
on
the
other
side.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time,
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
agree
that
we
have
to
show
in
a
contempt
hearing
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
failed
to
comply
with
a
valid
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
we
don't
agree
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
we
have
to
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
wouldn't
use
the
term
"probable
cause".
we
do--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we...
it
can
be
shown
by
inference.
ordinarily
you
would
expect
a
corporation
to
have
records
and
the
officer
to
have
possession
or
control
of
them,
as
it...
there
is
a
finding
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
on
page
17a,
finding
number
7,
"the
defendant
as
president
or
other
corporate
officer
had
possession
or
control
or
both
of
the
books
and
records
of
said
corporation.
"
and
this
is
based
partly
on
this
inference
from
the
circumstances,
but
also
on
page
54
of
the
joint
appendix
there
is
testimony
by
an
internal
revenue
agent
who
interviewed
mr.
rylander
in
1975,
that
he
indicated
that
at
that
time
the
records
were
in
existence,
and
that
they
were
at
apex
bookkeeping,
and
an
address
was
given
by
this
agent
testifying
about
what
mr.
rylander
said
in
the
interview
at
that
time.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
curcio,
unlike
this
case,
the
court
pointed
out
quite
specifically
at
page
21
the
conviction
related
solely
to
petitioner's
failure
to
answer
questions
as
pursuant
to
the
personal
subpoena
ad
testificandum.
he
had
not
been
charged
with
failing
to
produce
the
books
and
records
demanded
in
the
subpoena
duces
tecum.
he
had
been
called
to
the
stand
in
curcio
pursuant
to
the
subpoena
ad
testificandum,
and
the
questions
were
propounded
to
him.
in
our
situation
he
has
been
asked
to
produce
the
records,
and
it
was
up
to
him
either
to
produce
them
or
to
submit
third
party
testimony
about
why
he
couldn't
produce
them
or
to
take
the
stand.
that's
his
choice
of
voluntarily
taking
the
stand,
although
he
didn't
legitimately
do
it
because
he
refused
to
submit
to
cross
examination.
but
the
court
on
pages
57
and
58
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
district
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
could
purge
himself
of
the
contempt
by...
merely
by
indicating
his
willingness
to
comply
with
the
court's
order
relating
to
the
production
of
the
documents,
unlike
curcio's
situation
where
he
was
called
to
the
stand,
and
the
contempt
was
in
failing
to
answer
questions
propounded
to
him.
or
he
may
forthrightly
come
forward
to
this
court
and
in
fact
demonstrate
that
he
is
incapable
of
doing
so,
which
doesn't
necessarily
require
his
own
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i...
i...
i
would
prefer
that
it
be
more
explicit,
but
this
portion--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
right.
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
court's
explanation
on
page
58
of
the
joint
appendix.
