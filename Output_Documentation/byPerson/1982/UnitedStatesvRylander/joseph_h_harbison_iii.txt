mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
burger--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
this
case
is
really
all
about
is
whether
or
not
my
client,
mr.
rylander,
met
his
burden
of
production
on
his
defense
of
inability
to
comply
by
several
things,
not
just
his
oath
and
affirmation
that
he
didn't
have
the
documents,
but
when
he
showed
up
in
front
of
the
irs
on
february
4th
and
said
i
don't
have
them
and
i
take
the
fifth,
when
the
agents
testified
on
the
trial
on
october
8th
that
he
had
said
that,
when
he
filed
the
oath,
and
finally,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
when
he
took
the
stand
on
october
23rd
and
federal
judge
carlton
said
to
him,
"mr.
carl...
mr.
rylander,
you
have
filed
an
oath
in
purgation
stating
that
you
do
not
have
the
records.
"
he
said,
"that
is
correct,
your
honor.
"
judge
carlton
said
to
him,
"where
are
the
records"?
and
he
said,
"i
take
the
fifth
on
the
advice
of
my
counsel.
"
as
the
court
is
aware
from
the
record,
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him
on
october
9th,
the
day
after
the
trial,
a
combined
trial,
civil
and
criminal
contempt.
the
first
thing
i
did
immediately
was
have
the
civil
contempt
vacated.
we
then
proceeded
to
adduce
more
evidence.
so
it's
not
just
his
oath
that's
in
evidence
to
support
his
burden.
but
the
issue
here
is
is
the
oath...
and
i
say
along
with
his
other
testimony,
including
that
on
the
stand
and
that
in
front
of
the
irs
agent...
sufficient
to
meet
his
burden
of
production
at
a
contempt
hearing
to
prove
his
inability
sufficient
to
put
the
burden
of
production
again
back
to
the
government
along
with
their
burden
of
persuasion,
which
they
had
all
along,
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
prove
that
the
records
that
they
sought
ever
existed,
which
they
never
showed.
if
we
return
to
the
summons
enforcement
hearing,
which
this
court
has
said
in
donaldson
must
be
summary
in
nature,
and
this
court
said
in
powell
you
must
meet
only
these
minimum
conditions,
and
in
freedom
church
said
that
the
issue
of
his
possession,
the
person
summoned,
is
never
in
issue
was
met.
their...
their
offer
of
proof
there
was...
and
you
have
to
remember
this
is
1979
now...
excuse
me...
1980...
that
he
was
president
of
a
corporation
in
1975,
that
he
signed
two
checks
in
1975,
that
he
was
president
of
the
other
corporation
in
1975,
and
that
he
signed
two
checks
in
1975.
as
the
court
should
be
aware
from
the
trial
on
october
8th,
the
government
introduced
two
affidavits
from
the
secretary
of
state
of
california
that
both
of
those
corporations
weren't
active.
one
died
in
1975,
and
the
other
one
had
been
active
in
'74,
'76
and
'78.
so
the
government
at
the
summons
enforcement
hearing
never
had
the
burden
to
show
that
those
records
existed,
never
tendered
the
issue
that
those
records
existed,
and
never
proved
that
those
records
existed.
at
the
contempt
trial
for
the
first
time
mr.
rylander
said,
"the
reason
i
can't
produce
them
is
i
don't
have
them.
"
and
when
asked
why
don't
you
have
them,
he
properly,
under
mcphaul,
curcio,
o'henry,
meeks,
traub,
hansen
niederhauser
and
every
other
case
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
said,
"i
can't
tell
you
that.
"
"i
take--
"
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--yes.
that's
why
i
made
the
point
that
the
day
i
was
appointed,
the
day
after
the
so-called
trial,
i
had
the
civil
contempt
vacated.
there
was
no
longer
a
conviction
of
civil
contempt.
judge
carlton
gave
me
time
to
prepare
for
a
continued
hearing.
that
hearing
was
had
on
october
23rd.
at
that
hearing
judge
carlton
forced
mr.
rylander
to
the
stand.
he
asked
him
the
question,
"where
are
the
records"?
and
mr.
rylander
said,
"i
can't
answer
that.
"
"i
invoke
my
fifth
amendment
on
the
advice
of
counsel.
"
he
then
reinstated
civil
contempt.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no.
he
filed
the
oath,
the
affidavit
saying
i
don't
have
them.
the
first
question
from
the
federal
judge
is
"you
have
filed
an
oath
stating
you
do
not
have
them.
"
he
said,
"that
is
true".
the
second
question
was
"where
are
the
records"?
he
said,
"i
take
the
fifth".
that
was
the
end
of
the
questioning.
judge
carlton
said
i've
made
my
record.
take
it
to
the
ninth.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
that's
a
very
interesting
question,
judge
white.
the
initial--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--okay.
i--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--okay.
well,
i...
i
have
a
couple
of
points
to
make
to
answer
your
hypothetical.
first,
there
is
no
difference
between
producing
and
testifying.
the
original
summons
said,
"mr.
rylander,
come
testify
and
produce.
"
the
summons
enforcement
order
that
the
judge
signed
said
"produce".
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no.
and
nor
do
i
state
that
here.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
i
think
this
court--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--certainly.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
that...
i
haven't
finished
yet.
in
this
case
there
isn't
because
there
are
two
purging
conditions.
the
conditions
are
produce
or
testify.
now,
that's
my
precise
point
here.
to
carry
his
burden
of
production,
to
force
him
to
go
further
than
to
say
i
don't
have
them
and
i
can't
tell
you
their
whereabouts,
puts
him
in
the
cruel
trilemma
that
the
fifth
amendment,
the
policies
behind
it,
are
designed
to
protect.
he's
forced
to
produce
something
that
may
not
exist.
if
it
doesn't
exist,
he
goes
to
jail.
he's
forced
to
incriminate
himself
if
he
can't
produce
for
some
crime.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
my
point
is,
your
honor,
that
he
doesn't
have
to
make
that
showing.
that's
the
government's
burden
to
show
that
the
records
exist
once
he
states
inability.
once
he
tenders
an
issue
of
fact
"i
don't
have
them",
then
the
burden
goes
back
to
the
government
to
prove
that
they
exist,
and
if
the
government
proves
that,
he's
in
contempt.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
he
would
have
to
show
up--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--no,
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
the
so-called
presumption
that
he
is
in
possession
of
those
records
without
at
least
some
showing.
the
case
of
straub,
hansen
niederhauser,
rizzo...
they
all
say
no
contempt
unless
the
government--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--no,
but
fleischman
is,
your
honor.
fleischman
impliedly
said
since
the
government
has
shown
that
the
record
exist,
now
the
burden
is
on
you
to
give
us
some
reason
for
inability,
and
you've
given
us
nothing.
you
never
made
a
statement
to
the
committee
on
un-american
activities,
you
never
made
a
statement
to
the
district
court.
if
you
had
of
said...
they
used
the
word
"any"...
if
you
hadn't
made
any
reference
to
the
fact
of
inability,
then
the
burden
of
persuasion
is
back
to
the
government
to
show
they
exist,
and
if
they
show--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--i
disagree,
justice
o'connor.
he
has
met
his
burden
of
production.
i
agree
that
at
a
contempt
hearing
the
alleged
contemptor
has
to
tender
the
issue,
the
issue
being
inability.
he
does
that
by
saying
"i
don't
have
the
records".
now,
that...
if
that's
the
only
evidence--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--no.
i
think
you
missed
the
point
of
curcio
and
mcphaul.
once
he
says
"i
don't
have
them",
just
like
curcio...
curcio
admitted
they
existed
and
said
"i
don't
have
them".
and
the
court...
this
court
held
he
couldn't
cross
examine
him
as
to
whereabouts.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
that...
that
was
answered
in
o'henry.
o'henry
is
a
well-reasoned
opinion
of
curcio
and
mcphaul.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no,
it
is
not.
it
is,
i
believe,
a
fifth
circuit.
but
it's
a
well-reasoned
opinion
that
takes
into
account
curcio
and
mcphaul
just
as
meeks,
which
is
pending
before
this
court,
and
as
does
rylander.
it
was
established
long
ago
in
austin
bagley
corporation
by
judge
learned
hand
that
a
corporate
custodian
has
no
personal
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
produce
corporate
records,
but
having
produced
those,
he
can
give
unprivileged
testimony
to
identify
them.
he
makes
explicit
that
which
is
implicit
in
their
production.
curcio
and
then
o'henry
after
it
takes
that
rationale
and
says
when
a
corporate
custodian
produces
the
record
and
says...
when
he
doesn't
produce
the
records,
his
burden
requires
him
to
take
the
stand,
testify
under
oath,
as
mr.
rylander
did
here,
"i
do
not
have
them".
then
under
the
rationale
of
curcio,
you
can't
cross
examine
him
any
more
because
you're
going
to
violate
his
fifth
amendment
right.
that's--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--that's
one
of
the
questions
in
curcio,
one
of
the
15
written
questions:
"did
you
ever
have
them"?
and
"when
did
they
become
unavailable
to
you?
"
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no.
because
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
somebody
has
shown
that
those
records
existed
at
one
time,
and
in
all
the
cases
the
government
cites,
either
at
the
summons
enforcement
or
the
contempt
hearing,
one
of
those
two
the
government
carried
its
burden.
they
showed
that
the
records
exist.
they
showed
either
that
they
existed,
or
like
in
oriole
the
only
year
that
was
missing
was
1925,
in
maggio
the
trustee
made
a
specific
finding
in
the
turnover
order
that
they
existed,
in
nlrb
v.
transocean
a
special
master
was
appointed
and
specific
detailed
findings
were
made
that
they
existed.
that
has
never
happened
in
this
case.
if
the
government
had
tendered
the
issue
of
his
ability
either
at
the
summons
enforcement
or
at
the
trial
and
given
some
evidence,
any
kind,
one
scintilla
of
evidence
that
those
records
existed,
my
argument
wouldn't
hold
up.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no,
it
does
not,
and
that's
why
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
on
the--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--no.
a
corporation
does
have
to
keep
records.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
there
is
no
presumption
as
to
whose
possession
they
are
in,
but
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
corporate
officer
might
possess
them.
but
that
presumption
is
not
sufficient
to
get
a
conviction
of
contempt.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
including
the
president.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
apparently
someone
made
that
presumption
that
since
he
might
have
had
them
in
1975,
he
still
ought
to
have
them
in
1980,
but
there's
no
proof.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no,
i
do
not,
because
one
of
the
documents
that
the
government
introduced
at
trial
was
an
affidavit
from
the
secretary
of
state
saying
that
the
corporation
they
wanted
the
records
from
was
defunct
in
1975.
therefore,
they
wiped
out
any
presumption
they
might
have
had
with
their
own
evidence.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
because
they
proved
that
the
corporation
was
defunct;
therefore,
there's
no
presumption
that
it
was
keeping
any
records.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
that's
apparently
what
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing,
that
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
enforce
the
law.
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
make
an
exception
and
carve
out
a
piece
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it's
going
to
be
difficult--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--is
it
going
to
be
difficult?
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
i
would
need
more
facts.
do
they
have
the
liquor?
did
they
confiscate
it?
is
the
only
way
to
convict
them
the
records?
then
it
would
be
difficult.
if
there's
some
other
means,
then
no,
it
wouldn't
be
any
more
difficult
than
any
other
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
if
they
had
records--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--well,
you'd
have
a
better
case,
because
the
government
could
not--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
good.
it
would
be
harder
for
the
prosecution
to
prove
their
case
certainly
because
they...
one
avenue
of
proof
is
now
gone.
they
won't
have
the
company's
records.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
if
that's
the
only
evidence
they
have,
then
it's
impossible.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
i
agree--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--yes,
but
he
was
sentenced
for
that
because
he
is
unable
because
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
meet
his
burden.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
see,
no
one
knows
that.
it's
never
been
proved
by
the
government
the
records
exist.
if
they
don't
exist,
it's
impossible.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
therein
lies
the
issue.
he
has
rowed
the
oar,
i
am
arguing,
by
submitting
his
affidavit,
by
appearing
in
front
of
the
irs
agent
pursuant
to
the
enforcement
order
and
stating
he
does
not
have
them,
and
by
taking
the
stand
and
saying
he
cannot
testify
where
they
are.
he
has
done
enough.
to
force
him
to
go
further
forces
him
to
give
up
his
fifth
amendment
right
and
incriminate
himself
for
burning
those
records,
not
keeping
those
records,
and
subjecting
himself
to
further
criminal
penalties.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
he's
going
to
go
to
jail
if
he
doesn't.
that's
compulsion.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
that's
compulsion.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
he's
in
a
much
worse
position,
your
honor,
because
in
your
hypothetical
that
gentlemen
is
not
compelled.
he
has
a
tactical
choice
to
make,
albeit
difficult.
in
this
case
he
either
produces
the
records
or
goes
to
jail.
there
is
no
uncertainty.
in
your
hypothetical
the
man
has
a
tactical
advantage
about
whether
or
not
to
take
the
stand,
and
he
listens
to
the
prosecution's
case,
and
if
he
feels
it's
pretty
strong,
then
tactically
he's
going
to
have
to
take
the
stand
and
rebut
it.
if
he
doesn't,
he
stays
off.
that's
like
mcgautha
or
brooks
v.
tennessee
or
u.s.
v.
jackson.
they're
cases
that
compelled
the
violation
of
the
fifth
like
this
one
does.
it
said
you
either
testify
first
in
your
defense,
or
you
don't
testify
at
all.
and
the
other
one
said
if
you
plead
guilty
before
a
judge
under
a
specific
statute,
you
cannot
get
the
death
penalty.
you
must--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--then
i
would...
i
would
say
to
you,
your
honor,
if
you
were
the
district
court
judge
and
we
had
legitimate
presumption
of
possession
because
somebody
had
shown
it
at
the
summons
enforcement,
which
wasn't
done
here,
i
would
cite
to
you
the
case
of
maggio.
maggio
specifically
sets
forth
that
inability
is
a
defense
to
powell
for
conditions
under
powell
to
stop
the
order.
and
it's
also--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--no.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no.
there's
a
very
good
factual
distinction
in
maggio.
if
they
had
of
shown
possession
at
the
summons
enforcement,
then
you
have
a
legitimate
continuing
presumption
at
the
contempt
hearing.
then
they
have
made
their
prima
facie
case
of
contempt,
and
it's
up
to
him
to
show
present
inability
to
comply.
the
burden
would
be
on
him.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
yes.
at
least
to
get...
the
government
makes
a
very
novel
argument
on
page
21
and
25
of
their
brief.
they
claim
that
the
findings
of
fact
entered
by
the
court
on
october
24th,
the
day
after
contempt,
created
a
presumption,
retroactive,
that
he
had
the
records
at
the
summons
enforcement
hearing
eight
months
before
on
january
14th.
that
presumption
carried
forward
to
the
trial
on
october
8th.
that's
how
they
met
their
burden.
so
what
they're
saying
to
this
court
is
we
never
showed
he
had
possession.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
if
we
were
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
that
would
be
precisely
what
i'm
doing.
but
in
a
summons
enforcement,
the
issue
of
possession
does
not
arise.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
powell.
the
only
possession
in
powell
is
that
the
irs
doesn't
have
them,
and
mr.
rylander
already
beat
agent
vandenburg
in
a
prior
summons
enforcement
by
going
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
showing
that
she
did
have
possession.
she
lied
in
her
affidavit.
she
said
i
don't
have
possession,
but
the
irs
did.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
i
think
they
have,
your
honor,
because
every
case
they've
cited
for
the
proposition
that
they
have
this
continuing
presumption
or
that
there
was
a
final
appeal
of
our
order...
that
is,
res
judicata...
those
cases
that
they
cite
found
possession.
they
didn't
find
possession.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
ever.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
i
did.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no.
that's
why
the
government
doesn't
have
the...
the
government
wants
to
shift
the
burden
back
to
us.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
you're
right
to
a
certain
extent,
but
here--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--here,
after
my
client
makes
his
showing
and
the
burden
goes
back
to
them,
they
want
to
cross
examine
him
to
make
their
showing
instead
of
them
going
out
and
getting
the
third
party
or
introducing
the
extrinsic
evidence.
they
want
to
convict
him
out
of
his
own--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--your...
that
hypothetical
is
akin
to
a
fleischman-type
situation
where
the
government
did
show
some
possession,
and
the
person
failed
to
say
anything.
they
didn't
even
say
i
don't...
i
don't
have
the
ability.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
that's
true.
my
client
has
offered
some
explanation.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
that's
precisely
my
argument.
and
until
they
do,
he's
got
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
correct.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no.
i
think
we
jibe,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
in
your
hypothetical
you
take
it
as
a
given
that
somebody
has
proved
possession.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no,
it's
not
given
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
then
i
would
retract
that
answer
and
say
to
your
hypothetical
once
there
has
been
proven
possession,
the
fifth
amendment
is
no
longer
bona
fide.
the
burden
is
back
on
him,
and
he
will...
he
has
forfeited
it
because
the
government
has
shown
they
exist.
and
he
has
no--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--he's
in
contempt.
he
can
legitimately
be
held
in
contempt.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
and
he
wasn't
sent
there
because
he
wouldn't
violate
his
fifth
amendment
right
like
he
is
in
this
case,
because
they
never
carried
a
burden,
either
at
the
summons
enforcement
or
at
the
trial.
their
argument,
their
threefold
argument
here:
we
didn't
have
the
burden.
if
we
did
have
the
burden,
it
was
res
judicata
at
the
summons
enforcement,
although
the
issue
was
never
raised.
and
if
you
don't
like
that,
then
when
he
filed
the
affidavit,
that's
not
competent
evidence
to
carry
his
burden.
and
if
you
think
it
is
competent
evidence,
then
he
waived
his
fifth,
and
we
can
cross
examine
it
and
carry
our
burden.
all
of
their
arguments
are
thrusted
at
carrying
their
burden
that
the
records
existed,
which
it
didn't,
and
their
arguments
fail
because
there
is
no
proof.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
the
summons
enforcement
hearing.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
absolutely,
because
they
proved...
they
have
a
legitimate
presumption
that
the
records
exist,
and
he
has
not
rebutted
it.
he
can
still
take
the
fifth.
in
my
case
my
client
has
taken
the
fifth,
and
there
never
was
a
continuing
presumption.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
and
there's
no
proof
at
the
contempt
hearing
that
they
ever
existed.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
sure.
his
fifth
amendment
then
was
no
longer
bona
fide.
that's
why
the
ninth
circuit
said
send
it
back,
and
let's
see
if
it's
bona
fide,
and
let's
see
if
the
government
can
carry
some
burden
of
proof
here
to
show
that
the
records
exist.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
my
position
is
that
if
the
government
at
the
summons
enforcement
shows
that
they
exist,
they're
entitled
to
a
continuing
presumption.
if
they
don't
at
the
contempt
hearing,
they
must
put
on
a
prima
facie
case
that
the
records
exist.
in
the
light
of
either
of
those,
the
fifth
amendment
would
fall
and
he
would
be
held
in
contempt.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
prima
facie
is--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--that
carries
his
burden,
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no.
he
said
he
didn't
have
the
records
that
were
the
subject
of
the
subpoena.
i
don't
think
that's
an
admission
that
they
ever
existed.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no,
absolutely
not.
this
case
would
be
akin,
i
think,
on
the
issue
of
fifth
amendment
to
someone
who
committed
a
murder,
and
the
district
attorney
does
not
go
after
that
individual.
either
the
city
attorney
or
maybe
the
heir
of
the
person
murdered
files
a
civil
action,
and
they
hit
this
guy
with
a
summons,
a
subpoena,
or
a
motion
to
produce
the
gun.
and
he
shows
up
and
he
says
"i
don't
have
the
gun".
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
well,
i'm
trying
to
make
a
demonstration
of
the
fifth
amendment.
if
he's
forced
to
produce
that
gun,
obviously
he
violates
his
fifth
amendment'
because
he
would
be
convicting
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth.
that
is
what
the
government
here
wants
to
do.
they
want
to
violate
my
client's
fifth
amendment
to
carry
their
burden
of
proof,
and
my
argument
is
that
his
fifth
amendment
holds
up
as
long...
as
well
as
his
statement
that
he
does
not
have
those
records
until
the
government
at
either
the
summons
enforcement
or
the
contempt
hearing
proves
that
those
records
exist.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
yes.
at
some
time,
either
in
the
summons--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--absolutely.
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
decision
was
overturned,
because
the
federal
judge
at
page
353
of
the
transcript
stated,
"i
find
you
guilty
of
civil
contempt
by
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
and
i
tell
you,
mr.
robinson.
"
--who
was
the
u.s.
attorney...
"that
if
the
burden
is
clear
and
convincing,
we
have
a
serious
problem
here.
"
because
he
didn't
even
believe
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
mr.
rylander
was
in
civil
contempt.
and
the
government
in
all
of
its
briefs
in
both
the
criminal
and
civil
contempt
at
the
ninth
circuit
and
its
brief
here
admit
that
the
burden
is
clear
and
convincing.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
in
fact,
on
page
21
they
say
it's
on
us
by
clear
and
convincing
to
prove
inability.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
no.
because
they
can
send
the
summons
to
anybody,
and
under
freedom
church
it
doesn't
even
have
to
be
the
person
in
possession.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
right.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
an
order
enforcing
the
summons.
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
yes.
if
he
says
"i
don't
have
them"
and
takes
a
valid
fifth
amendment.
if
he
doesn't
have
a
valid--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--if
he
doesn't
have--
mr.
joseph
h.
harbison,
iii
--well,
if
he
doesn't
have
a
valid
fifth
amendment,
then
under
transocean
he
has
to
show
detail
why
he
doesn't
have.
