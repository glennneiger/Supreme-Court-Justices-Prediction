justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
your
argument
suggests
that
there's
a
lot
more
analytical
coherence
to
that
exemption
than
i've
ever
thought
there
was.
do
you
really
think
that
the
language
"routinely
disclosed"
and
so
forth
lends
itself
to
rather
precise
application
based
on
analogies
to
ordinary
civil
lawsuits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
a
problem,
though,
in
carrying
over
the
statutory
language
when
you
have
a
totally
abstract
defendant,
the
government,
and
there
isn't
any
live
lawsuit,
in
which
you
can
ordinarily
draw
the
conclusions
you
have
to
draw
and
decide
whether
to
allow
discovery
of
something
or
not?
it's
just
kind
of
a
half
a
lawsuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right
in
your
analysis
of
what
the
routine
discovery
language
of
exemption
5
means,
that
is
that
all
the
person,
the
hypothetical
plaintiff
or
defendant
making
a
showing
under
rule
26,
has
shown
is
relevancy--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--then
i
presume
that
work
product
would
be
almost
automatically
denied?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mason,
you
seem
to
make
a
great
deal
of
these
facts,
as
if
they
suggested
some
impropriety
on
the
government's
part.
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
simply
sent
one
employee,
a
government
employee,
to
infiltrate,
if
you
want
to,
a
client
whom
they
were
having
adversary
proceedings
against.
but
there
was
no
infiltration
of
the
legal
representation
of
that
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
ethical
violations
do
you
think
you
have
shown?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
sure
where
you
say
that,
mr.
mason.
it
was
my
impression
that
hickman
against
taylor
laid
down
the
work
product
rule
that
work
product
was
not
ordinarily
or
routinely
discoverable
unless
in
cases
of
real
dire
necessity
where
the
other
party
simply
couldn't
get
the
information
in
any
other
way.
now,
if
it's
relevant
information,
which
i
assume
you
think
yours
is,
i
don't
see
why
this
is
the
kind
of
information
that
couldn't
be
gotten
in
some
other
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
were
they
relevant,
anyway?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
have
you
ever
tried
a
lawsuit
in
which
you
didn't
have
to
go
out
and
get
supplemental
evidence,
sometimes
during...
while
witnesses
were
testifying?
you
never
know
how
your
case
is
going
to
hold
up.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
on
earth
would
you
tell
the
lawyer
for
the
other
side?
he'd
probably
prevent
it
from
having
any
use.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mason,
do
you
think
then
we
should
adopt
a
principle
that...
supposing
it's
not
judge
fisher
in
new
jersey
but
judge
schmaltz
in
wisconsin,
and
he
files
a
perfectly
bizarre
order
directing
the
government
to
disclose
information
which
they
would
much
rather
dismiss
their
lawsuit
than
conform
to.
and
say
all
members
of
any
court
which
would
look
at
judge
schmaltz'
order,
except
judge
schmaltz,
would
think
it's
just
off
the
wall.
do
you
think
nonetheless
that
in
an
foia
proceeding
one
is
bound
by
a
discovery
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can't
really
appeal
a
discovery
order.
you
can
get
a
mandamus
on
it.
