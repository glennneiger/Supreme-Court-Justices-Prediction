we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
federal
trade
commission
against
grolier
incorporated.
mr.
geller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

but
you
wouldn't
carry
that...
you
don't
intimate
any
analogy
as
between
a
private
lawyer
and
his
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
ownership.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
private
lawyer
owns--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--and
absolutely
controls
the
work
product.
chief
justice

e.

but
when
the
government
has
a
lawyer,
the
government
and
the
lawyer
are
more
or
less
merged
into
one,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
example,
when
a
government
lawyer
leaves
the
government,
the
department
of
justice
or
whatever,
he
may
not
take
his
papers--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--with
him--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--unless
he
has
special
permission.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
mason.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
were
you
talking
about
the
ethical
factors
so
much
when
you
now
tell
us
that
you
don't
know
whether
you've
shown
any?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
why
talk
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
cast
some
sort
of
a
cloud
over
the
argument
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
impression
you're
giving
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
brief
gave
me
the
same
impression.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
