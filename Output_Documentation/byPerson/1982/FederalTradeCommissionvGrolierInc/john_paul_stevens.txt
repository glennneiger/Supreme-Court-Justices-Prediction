justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
are
these
documents
among
those
that
were
refused
to
be
disclosed
pursuant
to
the
1976
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they're
the
same
documents
in
both
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
may
i
ask
you
a
kind
of
a...
maybe
it's
not
very
helpful,
but
in
the
attorney-client
privilege
area,
the
privilege
belongs
to
the
client.
in
the
work
product
area,
is
it
clear
who
owns
the
privilege,
whether
the
client
or
the
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's
the
lawyer
rather
than...
here
it's
the
client
that's
really
relying
on
it
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
think
in
this
case,
for
example,
if
the
lawyer
who
ran
this
investigation,
whoever
it
may
be,
had
left
the
government
service
and
decided
he
was
willing
to
waive
the
privilege,
you'd
probably
assume
he
could
do
so?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
what
do
you
say
about
their
argument
that
there
should
be
an
exception
for
documents
that
show
unethical
conduct
by
the
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
is...
or
maybe
i
just
get
this
out
of
the
briefs.
but
isn't
there
some
basis
for
believing
that
the
documents
indicate
that
the
government
put
an
informer
in
their
training
program
and
that
sort
of
thing?
or
is
that
just
speculation?
there's
nothing
unethical
about
that,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
"routinely
discoverable"
argument
as
i
understand
it
means,
if
there
is
any
burden
on
the
proponent
of
discovery
in
the
civil
litigation
context
to
overcome
any
slight
objection,
then
it's
not
routinely.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
would
be
an
argument
that
would
sustain
the
judgment
below.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
documents
in
issue
before
us?
i
know
the
court
of
appeals--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
were
examined
by
the
district
judge
and
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
are
not
in
the
papers
that
are
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mason.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
point
on
that
question.
the
action
that
was
terminated
was
the
penalty
action,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
an
action
to
penalize
grolier-americana
for
violating
a
1948
order,
was
that
not
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
1948
order
still
on
the
books?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
there
a
possibility
that
that
order
might
be
violated
in
the
future?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
make
sure.
i'm
not
totally
sure
i
understand
you.
if
an
identical
proceeding
to
the
one
that
was
filed
in
'72
or
'76
were
filed
again
and
the
government
wanted
to
use
the
same
investigative
technique
and
the
same
appraisal
of
evidence
that
may
be
disclosed
in
these
documents,
why
wouldn't
these
documents
then
be
related
to
that
potential
litigation?
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem...
the
answer,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
documents
should
not
be
disclosable
because
there
is
potential
litigation
on
the
horizon.
maybe
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
this
case?
that's
what
i'm
really
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
also
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
another
enforcement
proceeding
of
the
1948
order,
as
i
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
be
happy
with
that
rule,
but
you'd
lose
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
and
the
government
hasn't
made
this
argument.
but
i
was
just
trying
to
think
it
through.
well,
you
go
ahead
with
your
argument.
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
you
don't
really
contend
it
mirrors
civil
discovery.
you're
contending
it's
somewhat
narrower,
because
of
the
"routinely"
requirement.
if
this
was
discoverable--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
view
is
that
really
in
specific
cases
it's
narrower,
foia
is
narrower,
whereas
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
view
it
was
broader.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
