mr.
daniel
s.
mason
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
preliminarily,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
it
is
true
that
the
government
did
not
raise
the
deliberative
process
exemption.
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
the
court
of
appeals
sua
sponte
noted
that
fact,
your
honor.
now,
the
government
does
not
like
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
accordingly
they
don't
talk
about
them.
they
didn't
talk
about
them
in
the
certiorari
petition
and
they
don't
talk
about
them
in
the
brief.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
your
honor,
this
case
is
unique
in
the
annals
of
foia
litigation
in
this
court
and
in
every
other
case
that
we
know
of
in
that
the
documents
that
are
the
subject
of
this
appeal
were
ordered
produced
in
litigation
by
federal
district
judge
fisher.
no
other
case
has
had
these
circumstances.
not
certain
documents
the
government
called;
these
very
documents.
that
is
undisputed
in
this
record.
the
government
neither
appealed
that
decision
nor
did
they
appeal
the
dismissal
with
prejudice
when
the
government
did
not
return
those
documents.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
what
showing
did
the
americana
corporation
make,
your
honor?
the
document...
the
showing
that
was
made
was
as
follows.
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed
by
the
department
of
justice
against
americana
in
february
1972,
after
an
answer
was
filed,
after
counsel
appeared,
after
discovery
commenced,
counsel
for
the
ftc
told
an
ftc
investigator
to
go
to
the
company
and
take
a
job
surreptitiously
and
try
to
obtain
"supplemental
evidence".
mr.
howerton,
the
lawyer
who
gave
this
instruction,
did
not
tell
counsel
for
americana
that
they
were
doing
this.
counsel
for
americana
discovered
this
fact
and
brought
this
to
the
attention
of
the
magistrate
then
conducting
discovery
proceedings,
and
the
magistrate
in
an
oral
opinion
ordered
the
documents
produced,
the
documents
being,
your
honor,
the
documents
generated
as
a
result
of
and
pursuant
to
the
so-called
investigation.
this
is--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--yes,
your
honor,
a
rule
37
motion
filed
by
the
defendant
in
the
americana
litigation.
the
magistrate
ordered
those
documents
produced
and--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
well,
the
standard
under
rule
37...
the
government--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--well,
the
standard
under
rule
37
would
be
whether
they're
relevant,
whether
it
fits
all
the
other
tests.
the
government--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--well,
the
main
test
in
civil
litigation,
your
honor,
under
rule
37
is
whether
the
documents
are
relevant
or
may
lead
to
relevant
evidence
or
information
in
the
litigation.
the
government
objected
and
responded
by
asserting
privilege
before
judge
fisher
and
before
the
magistrate.
judge
fisher
in
a
memorandum
opinion
which
we
have
in
our
brief
said,
i
am
going
to
reject
the
government's
claim
of
privilege.
and
all
judge
fisher
said
is
to
recite
the
facts:
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
while
discovery
was
under
way,
counsel
for
the
ftc
directed
that
this
particular
individual
go
to
americana
and
try
to
obtain
supplemental
information.
i
concede
that
there
was
no
finding
by
judge
fisher
of
any
unethical
practices
or
so
forth.
but
the
facts
are
very
clear
as
to
what
happened.
the
government
does
not
challenge
those
facts
in
this
case
and
they
did
not
below
and
did
not
take
an
appeal.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
your
honor,
so
the
court
is
clear,
we
are
not
contending
that
this
case
should
be
affirmed
because
we've
shown
some
ethical
violation.
all
we
are--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
we've
shown
any.
we
think
there
are
facts
in
the
record
that
raise
questions.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
your
honor,
there
was
no
finding
by
the
district
court
of
any
ethical
practice,
and
i
would
not
tell
this
court
that
it
should
make
a
ruling
based
on
any
ethical
violation
that
was
found
below.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
because,
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--no,
your
honor.
the
only
reason--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--the
only--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--your
honor,
the
only
reason
we
have
raised
that
point
is
to
indicate
that
this
case
is
slightly
different
than
the
type
of
documents
that
were
generated
by
mr.
fortenbas
in
hickman
versus
taylor.
that's
the
only
point
we're
making
on
those
particular
documents.
we
are
not
saying
that
because
there
was
some
"unethical
violation"
that
the
government
loses
that
privilege.
we
mainly
point
that
out
as
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
clear
that
in
point
of
fact
this
contact
was
made.
but
that
is
not
necessary
and
we
do
not
urge
that
the
court
has
to
reach
that.
the
point
we
are
making
is
that,
based
upon
the
record
before
judge
fisher,
the
judge
did
order
those
documents
produced.
that
is
clear.
we
believe
under
exemption
5
the
result
is
very
clear.
exemption
5
does
not
apply.
the
reason
exemption
5
does
not
apply
is
because
the
exemption
talks
about
documents
not
available
in
litigation.
the
government
of
course
has
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
with
that
argument,
and
so
mr.
geller
and
the
briefs
present
a
syllogism,
and
there
is
some
practicality
or
simplicity
to
it,
but
upon
examination
it
falls
apart.
here
is
what
the
government
says:
point
number
one:
documents
are
available
under
foia
only
if
"routinely
available"
in
civil
litigation.
point
number
two:
to
get
work
product
documents
in
civil
litigation
under
rule
26
you
always
have
to
show
some
need.
the
government
therefore
concludes
that
you
may
never
in
a
foia
case
ever
get
work
product
because
to
get
work
product
you
would
necessarily
have
had
to
make
a
showing
of
need
in
the
private
litigation.
that,
your
honor,
is
simply
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
said.
justice
powell,
for
instance,
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
nlrb
against
robbins,
which
this
court
cited
with
approval
in
merrill,
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
work
product
standards
under
the
civil
rules
of
procedure
are
not
as
broad
as
work
product
under
foia.
indeed,
there
are
circumstances
where
this
court
has
directed
work
product
to
be
produced
in
foia
cases.
for
instance,
some
courts
have
read
the
sears
opinion
to
say
work
product
of
a
factual
nature
which
winds
up
in
a
final
opinion
is
produceable.
at
least
four
circuits
have
held...
deering
milliken
and
the
robbins
case,
and
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
on
other
grounds...
have
said
purely
factual
work
product
is
available.
the
government's
argument
necessarily
would
have
to
have
this
court
accept
the
proposition
that
work
product
is
never
available
in
foia.
that
is
not
what
this
court
has
ever
said
and
it
would
have
this
court
overrule
four
different
circuits
which
have
said
that.
the
only
point,
to
respond
again
to
the
chief
justice's
comments
with
respect
to
what
our
contentions
are
with
respect
to
the
so-called
practices
that
mr.
howerton
took,
are
with
respect
to
the
hickman
versus
taylor
argument
that
we
hear
much
about.
if
i
might
have
a
brief
bit
of
license
with
legal
history,
let
us
suppose
that
mr.
fortenbas,
the
attorney
involved
in
hickman,
instead
of
going
out
after
he
was
hired
by
the
tugboat
owners
and
the
underwriters,
and
instead
of
interviewing
third
party
witnesses
before
the
litigation
had
commenced,
had
advised
his
clients
as
follows:
wait
until
petitioner
in
hickman
files
a
lawsuit.
after
the
petitioner
in
hickman
files
a
lawsuit
then
you,
my
clients,
hire
some
agents
to
go
talk
to
the
petitioner
surreptitiously
and
try
to
get
some
"evidence".
the
only
point...
that's
this
case.
that
is
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
only
point
i
am
making
and
that
we
make
in
our
briefs
on
that
issue...
and
again,
i
don't
suggest
the
court
need
reach
it,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
type
of
documents
we're
talking
about.
the
point
that
we
are
making,
that
if
those
had
been
the
facts
of
hickman
versus
taylor
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
rule
announced
by
the
court
in
that
opinion
would
have
been
substantially
different.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
your
honor,
your
honor
is
talking
about
the
howerton
documents,
how
we
could
have
gotten
those
in
some
other
way?
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
your
honor,
we
asked
for
those
documents--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--your
honor,
the
reason
they
were
relevant
is
because
the
federal
trade
commission
had
filed
an
action
against
americana
corporation
alleging
all
types
of
violations
of
a
cease
and
desist
order.
by
mr.
howerton's
own
concession
he
had
to
get
"supplemental
evidence"
to
buttress
that
claim,
and
he
did
it
in
a
manner
which
was
inconsistent--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--your
honor,
justice
rehnquist,
the
only
point
we
are
making...
and
it
is
not
a
big
point
in
our
appeal,
but
i
want
to
be
responsive
to
your
honor's
questions...
the
only
point
we
are
making
is
that
the
documents
that
were
generated
here
were
generated
as
a
result
of
an
effort
by
counsel
for
plaintiff,
counsel
for
the
government,
in
litigation
against
defendant,
which
instructed
his
client
to
go,
after
a
lawsuit
had
been
started,
after
counsel
had
been
retained
by
the
defendant,
and
try
to
go
and
get
some
supplemental
information
or
so-called
evidence
without
telling
the
lawyer
for
the
other
side.
we
believe
that
that--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--your
honor,
because
disciplinary
rule
7.104
says
that
after
a
lawsuit
is
filed
and
the
other
side
hires
a
lawyer
you,
the
lawyer
for
one
party,
can't
approach
the
other
defendant
on
the
subject
of
the
representation
or
the
litigation
without
advising
the
lawyer
who
represents
the
other
party.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
your
honor--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
because
justice
rehnquist
asked
me
the
question,
your
honor,
and
i
wanted
to
be
responsive.
but
that
is
absolutely
correct.
now,
your
honors,
i
have
suggested
and
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
a
very
narrow
grounds
upon
which
the
judgment
could
be
affirmed
below,
and
that
is
merely
to
say
these
documents
were
available
in
litigation
to
a
party,
they
were
ordered
produced,
therefore
exemption
5
doesn't
apply,
and
the
court
on
those
narrow
grounds
could
affirm
that
judgment.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
i
would
assume,
your
honor,
the
government
does
not
appeal
judge
schmaltz's
outrageous
order--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--your
honor,
a
lot
of
times
the
government
will
take
a
dismissal
with
prejudice,
as
they
did
in
leggett
&
platt,
and
appeal
that
up
to
the
circuit
court.
the
government
did
neither.
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
yes,
because
that's
what
exemption
5
says,
documents
available
in
litigation.
they'd
have
to
show
that
they
were
not
available.
moreover,
the
government's
argument
that
it
has
to
be
routinely
available,
which
they
take
from
senate
report
813
and
this
court's
statement
in
sears,
was
concerned
about
the
hypothetical
plaintiff.
let's
not
forget,
it
is
conceivable
that
one
could
conjure
up
a
hypothetical
plaintiff
in
civil
litigation
who
might
be
able
to
show
need
for
a
certain
document.
that
is
what
the
court
was
concerned
about.
mr.
geller's
statement
that
it
is
improper
to
order
these
documents
produced
on
the
theory
of
routinely
available
misconstrues
the
legislative
history
that
this
court
has
talked
about
and
that
clearly
is
set
forth
in
senate
rule
813.
i'd
like
your
honors...
and
if
your
honors
want
to
reach
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i'd
like
to
address
that
issue
also.
first
of
all,
counsel
is
simply
incorrect
when
he
states
that
the
court
of
appeals
conflicts
with
other
circuits.
i
assume
he
is
talking
about
duplan
in
the
fourth
circuit,
leggett
&
platt
in
the
sixth
circuit,
and
murphy
in
the
eighth
circuit.
those
cases
indeed
hold
in
the
civil
litigation
context,
in
the
civil
litigation
context
under
rule
26,
that
work
product
will
not
terminate
after
the
litigation
is
over.
those
are
rule
26
cases,
not
inconsistent
with
foia.
but
more
important,
in
each
of
those
circuit
court
opinions,
your
honor,
the
courts
have
said,
we
might
not
hold
this
but
for
the
fact
that
work
product
is
qualified.
therefore,
even
under
the
holdings
in
those
circuit
court
opinions
the
plaintiffs,
if
they
were
able
to
make
a
showing,
could
still
get
those
documents.
and
indeed,
your
honor,
in
leggett
&
platt
the
sixth
circuit
remanded
and
said,
although
we
fashion
this
rule,
if
the
plaintiff
can
show
in
the
district
court
that
he
really
needs
this
he'll
get
these
documents
anyway.
the
point
being
that
when
the
government
says
the
d.c.
circuit's
rule
conflicts,
it's
simply
not
correct.
moreover,
at
least
two
justices
of
this
court
have
hinted
that
the
work
product
rule
should
terminate
at
trial.
i
refer
to
justice
white's
concurring
opinion
in
united
states
versus
nobles,
concurred
in
by
justice
rehnquist.
and
justice
white
noted
in
that
concurrence,
number
one--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--it
is
a
concurrence,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
language
is
very
persuasive.
justice
white
says
in
the
concurring
opinion:
point
number
one,
hickman
versus
taylor
didn't
say
there
was
a
privilege
for
work
product.
indeed,
if
the
court
carefully
examines
hickman
versus
taylor,
the
court
says
the
documents
are
not
available
because
they're
not
discoverable
under
rule
26.
justice
white
went
further
and
said,
there
was
some
reason
the
supreme
court
in
hickman
versus
taylor
said,
it's
not
a
privilege,
it's
simply
not
discoverable,
because
the
court
wanted
to
leave
open
the
possibility,
as
i
read
justice
white's
opinion,
that
maybe
this
material,
this
so-called
work
product,
would
be
available
post-discovery.
justice
white
also
points
out
in
that
concurring
opinion
the
reasons
for
having
the
work
product
privilege
in
discovery,
i.e.,
that
a
lawyer,
be
it
a
government
lawyer
or
anybody
else,
would
not
want
to
amass
the
information
for
fear
his
adversary
will
get
it,
is
evaporated
at
trial.
a
fortiori,
if
it
is
evaporated
at
trial,
clearly
it's
evaporated
when
the
litigation
is
dismissed.
and
the
d.c.
circuit
went
farther
than
that.
it
said
if
there's
any
related
litigation
you're
not
going
to
get
it,
and
if
there's
any
potentially
related
litigation.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
your
honor,
i
believe
the
ftc...
and
we're
representing
americana.
i
believe
it
is
still
on
the
books,
there
is
still
a
consent
decree.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
your
honor,
i
would
not
want
to
suggest
that
my
client
would
do
that,
but
yes,
there
could
be
a
possibility,
but
that
is
a
pending
case.
there
is
a
consent
degree.
that
case
is
not
terminated.
that
is
a
pending
case.
and
although
the
issue
of
what
is
related
and
what
is
not
related
is
not
before
this
court,
i
might
readily
agree
if
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
we
couldn't...
that
that
would
be
a
bar
to
getting
documents.
but
i
would
say
that,
your
honor,
the
d.c.
circuit's
opinion
carefully
made
it
very
helpful
for
the
government
because
of
the
fact
that
if
there's
a
consent
degree
pending,
it
just
hasn't
been
terminated
and
perhaps
under
justice
white's
rule
in
nobles
the
documents
could
be
had.
but
certainly
under
the
d.c.
circuit
they
couldn't,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
should
give
ample
protection
to
the
government.
now
one
other
point
that
i
think
is--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--your
honor,
because
under
the
d.c.
circuit's
rules
the
litigation
must
be
terminated
and,
step
two,
there
must
be
no
related
litigation.
under
your
honor's
hypothetical,
in
fact
as
the
case
is,
if
there
is
a
consent
degree
which
is
still
on
file
in
a
federal
district
court,
the
litigation
is
not
"terminated".
it's
still
there.
and
that
really...
i
hope
that
answers
your
honor's
question.
but
under
the
facts
of
that
situation--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--yes,
your
honor,
but
also
sine
quo
non,
the
reason
for
having
the
rule,
i.e.
terminated
litigation,
hasn't
happened.
if
there
is
a
consent
degree
pending
in
a
federal
district
court
and
under
the
d.c.
circuit's
rule
somebody
wants
documents
relating
to
that,
i
would
say
they
don't
get
them
because
the
litigation
isn't
over.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
because
the
documents
we're
asking
for
in
this
case
were
generated
in
the
enforcement
proceeding--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--which
was
dismissed
with
prejudice.
we
are
not,
justice
stevens,
asking
for
documents
in
the
consent--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--but
in
the
underlying
litigation.
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
i
would
say
with
respect
to
that,
if
that
would
be
the
rule
that
the
court
would
want
to
fashion...
and
as
i
say
that--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--your
honor,
we
are
not
asking...
i
don't
think
that's
correct,
because
we
are
not...
we
don't
say
that
there
is
a
relation
here
between
the
consent
decree
and
discovery--
mr.
daniel
s.
mason
--all
right.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
suspect
that
under
your
argument
each
side
could
make
arguments
and
that
would
be,
i
suggest,
decided
on
a
case
by
case
basis
in
the
district
court.
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
few
other
comments
with
respect
to
what
counsel
has
said.
the
d.c.
circuit
standard
does
not
go
as
far
as
other
situations
and
other
arguments
the
government
has
made.
in
united
states
versus
ibm,
in
chief
judge
ellestein's
court,
the
government
urged
the
rule
that
you
should
get
documents,
work
product
documents,
upon
termination
of
litigation.
and
there
are
several
district
court
opinions,
albeit
only
district
court
opinions,
that
would
go
farther
than
the
d.c.
circuit's
rule
in
foia.
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
point.
most
of
the
argument
in
the
government's
brief,
at
least
half
of
it,
is
directed
to
the
situation
of
civil
discovery.
this,
your
honor,
is
a
foia
case.
there
is
no
issue
here
with
respect
to
discovery
of
work
product
in
civil
litigation
under
rule
26.
indeed,
in
merrill
the
court
said,
we
are
not
going
to
decide
this
in
the
discovery
rule
26
context.
therefore,
the
court
should
examine
these
parameters
not
under
rule
26
but
under
foia
legislative
history
that
says,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
said,
disclosure
at
a
zenith.
we
interpret
exemptions
very
narrowly
under
foia.
the
government
has
a
greater
burden
under
foia.
the
argument
that
there
may
be
some
harm
in
civil
discovery
is
simply
not
before
this
court,
and
nothing
the
d.c.
circuit
said
would
indicate
that
this
particular
ruling
could
apply
in
the
work
product
rule
or
under
rule
26.
finally,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
so-called
parade
of
horribles
that
the
government
is
suggesting
will
happen
if
the
d.c.
circuit's
rule
is
upheld.
first
of
all,
they
say
if
this
rule
is
the
case
and
is
upheld
the
government
will
not
amass
or
prepare
its
case.
probably
the
best
answer
i
could
give
to
that
is
what
justice
white
said
concurring
in
nobles.
if
the
purpose
of
the
work
product
rule,
as
justice
white
said,
is
to
protect
the
adversary
process,
when
the
litigation
is
over
and
your
adversary
cannot
get
those
documents
and
use
them
against
you,
the
raison
d'etre,
if
you
will,
of
hickman
evaporates.
now,
i
submit
that
that
is
clearly
the
situation
in
this
particular
litigation.
when
the
lawsuit
is
over,
clearly
when
it's
dismissed
with
prejudice,
not
even
having
to
get
to
the
issue
of
related
litigation,
the
so-called
advantage
that
hickman
versus
taylor
was
concerned
about
simply,
simply
will
not
happen,
because
the
other
lawyer
can't
use
those
work
product
materials
against
the
government.
the
government
has
other
parades
of
horribles.
the
government
says
government
attorneys
will
not
write
mistakes
or
memorialize
their
wrongdoing
or
errors
in
the
files.
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
that
would
happen.
this
is
an
argument
they
make
on
appeal.
but
i
think
it's
clear,
your
honor,
that
lawyers
simply
do
not
sit
around
writing
memorandums
to
the
files
indicating
that
they've
made
all
kinds
of
mistakes.
that
simply
is
a
red
herring.
the
government
also
says
that
now
we
might
have
to
destroy
our
files,
heaven
forbid,
if
this
rule
stays.
well,
in
point
of
fact,
as
the
government
points
out,
government
lawyers
are
very
transient,
and
i
think
this
court
should
accept
the
clear
proposition
that
government
lawyers
are
not
going
to
destroy
their
files
because
of
this
so-called
work
product
privilege.
as
i
believe
justice
o'connor
said,
the
work
product
privilege
today
is
qualified.
under
the
rationale
of
the
government,
all
those
fears
would
happen
right
now,
because
it
may
well
be
that
mr.
geller's
work
product
in
this
case
conceivably
could
be
ordered
produced
by
a
federal
district
judge
if
some
other
conceivable
party
would
make
a
showing
of
need.
many
of
the
arguments
the
government
makes,
in
other
words,
clearly
are
not
going
to
have
any
application,
because
the
fears,
the
so-called
concerns,
are
already
there.
with
respect
to
so-called
pending
investigations,
exemption
no.
7
is
there.
there's
also
exemption
no.
5.
the
government
didn't
use
that
exemption
in
this
case.
i
don't
know
why.
maybe
they
forgot
about
it,
maybe
they
made
a
mistake.
but
clearly
a
concern
that
government
lawyers
would
have
could
be
covered
under
exemption
7
or
exemption
5.
let's
talk
about
the
related
test
in
my
few
remaining
minutes.
the
government
says,
well,
we
can't
fashion
a
related
litigation
test,
it's
impossible,
no
court
will
ever
do
it.
well,
your
honors,
it
happens
all
the
time.
section
5
of
the
apa
has
the
issue
about
related
litigation,
whether
if
you
sit
as
a
factfinder
on
it,
whether
you
can
do
that
if
you
were
working
on
the
investigation.
the
ftc
has
interpreted
that
many
times.
section
28
u.s.c.
1407,
just
for
another
example,
the
venue
statute,
says
if
there
are
common
questions
of
law
and
fact
maybe
they
should
be
multidistricted
in
one
case.
united
mine
workers
versus
gibbs
says,
common
issues
of
fact,
whether
it
arises
out
of
the
same
concern,
whether
it
arises
out
of
the
same
circumstance.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
court
should
adopt
one
of
those
so-called
related
litigation
tests.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
it
is
a
workable
rule,
courts
have
done
it
all
the
time.
the
government
simply
errs
when
it
says
we
can't
do
that,
we
can't
fashion
that
test.
the
best
thing
to
do,
your
honors,
i
submit,
is
to
have
this
done
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
after
all,
under
the
sherman
act
rule
of
reason
the
court
annunciates
the
rule
of
reason
law
and
rule.
it
doesn't
say,
here
is
every
circumstance
that
is
reasonable
conduct
or
not
reasonable
conduct.
that's
for
determination
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
finally,
with
respect
to
potential
litigation.
first
of
all,
the
d.c.
circuit
had
that
test
to
help
the
government.
mr.
geller
got
that
test
to
help
him,
because
without
it
it
would
just
be
related
litigation.
now
he
doesn't
like
it
and
he
attacks
that
and
apparently
he
thinks
that's
why
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
again,
related
litigation
and
potentially
related
litigation;
you
have
the
same
test
in
great
part.
i
would
suggest
the
following,
potential
related
litigation.
the
government
could
say,
we
have
a
grand
jury
investigation
going
on.
the
government
could
say,
we
have
subpoenas
under
the
hart-scott-rodino
antitrust
improvements
act.
the
government
can
say,
we
have
an
investigation
under
the
ftc.
these
are
examples.
there
are
others.
the
only
thing
i
am
saying
is
that
the
potential
related
litigation
test
is
workable,
it's
been
done
in
other
contexts.
this
court
need
not
concern
itself
right
now
with
formulating
a
specific
test
because
the
court
of
appeals
said,
remand
this
thing
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
will
determine.
lastly
if
i
may,
this
question
about
why
we
want
these
documents
and
doesn't
this
relate
to
the
ftc-grolier
proceeding
in
the
ninth
circuit.
in
point
of
fact,
as
we
submitted
to
the
clerk
last
week,
the
administrative
law
judge
which
had
that
proceeding
said,
these
cases
are
not
related.
i'm
now
referring
to
the
ninth
circuit
proceeding
and
the
americana
proceeding.
and
the
government,
the
ftc,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
said
those
cases
are
not
related.
again,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that
decision.
it's
not
before
the
court.
i
only
point
that
out
here
because
mr.
geller
thinks
it's
important
and
he
wants
to
make
the
argument.
also,
we
don't
say
and
we
never
have
that
because
of
the
so-called
other
case
out
there
we
have
a
need
for
it.
we
have
never
argued
in
this
court
that
we
should
get
these
documents
because
of
need
or
because
of
anything
else,
because
respondent
recognizes
under
sears
that
that
does
not
make
us
any
greater
or
give
us
any
lesser
right
to
obtain
these
documents.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
