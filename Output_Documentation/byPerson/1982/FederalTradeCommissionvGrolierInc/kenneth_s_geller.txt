mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
freedom
of
information
act
case
in
which
the
respondent,
grolier
incorporated,
seeks
access
to
work
product
prepared
by
federal
trade
commission
attorneys
for
a
civil
action
that
ended
several
years
ago.
the
commission
denied
the
foia
request
on
the
ground
that
the
documents
were
protected
by
the
attorney
work
product
privilege
and
were
therefore
exempt
from
disclosure
under
exemption
5
of
the
foia.
exemption
5
protects
against
mandatory
disclosure
of
memorandums
or
letters
that
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
in
litigation
with
the
agency,
and
it's
quite
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
foia
and
from
this
court's
decisions
that
exemption
5
incorporates
the
work
product
privilege
and
is
intended
to
protect
the
work
product
of
government
attorneys
against
mandatory
public
disclosure.
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
ordered
the
documents
disclosed.
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
attorney
work
product
from
terminated
litigation
remains
privileged
only
when
litigation
related
to
the
terminated
action
exists
or
potentially
exists.
we
have
sought
review
of
this
holding
because
it's
contrary
to
every
other
appellate
ruling
on
the
temporal
scope
of
the
work
product
privilege
and
because
it
would
have
a
particularly
devastating
effect
on
the
conduct
and
working
papers
of
government
attorneys.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
can
be
briefly
stated.
in
1972
the
government
brought
a
civil
action
against
the
americana
corporation,
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
grolier,
charging
americana
with
violating
a
1949
cease
and
desist
order
prohibiting
false
advertising
and
misrepresentations
in
the
door
to
door
sale
of
encyclopedias.
the
suit
was
dismissed
in
1976
when
the
ftc
refused
to
comply
with
a
discovery
order
requiring
it
to
turn
over
certain
documents
relating
to
a
covert
investigation
of
americana's
sales
techniques.
in
1978
grolier
brought
this
foia
suit
seeking
access
to
records
relating
to
the
americana
investigation.
in
response,
the
ftc
turned
over
literally
7,000
pages
of
documents,
but
it
withheld
a
very
few
documents
on
the
ground
of
attorney
work
product.
the
district
court
conducted
an
in
camera
examination
of
the
disputed
documents
and
agreed
with
the
ftc
that
they
constituted
attorney
work
product.
the
district
court
found
that
the
documents
encompassed
opinions
by
ftc
attorneys
regarding
the
evidentiary
needs
of
the
americana
action
and
discussed
specific
methods
of
obtaining
evidence
for
use
in
that
litigation.
the
district
court
therefore
found
that
the
documents
fell
squarely
within
the
work
product
privilege
and
were
therefore
exempt
from
disclosure
under
exemption
5
of
the
foia.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
they
are.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
some
of
them
are
the
same
documents.
as
i
noted
a
moment
ago--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
correct,
of
the
dismissal
of
the
americana
action.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
the
district
court
found
that
americana
had
made
a
sufficient
showing
of
need
for
the
documents
and
of
hardship
to
overcome
the
qualified
privilege
that
attached
to
the
documents,
and
the
judge
ordered
the
disclosure
of
the
documents.
but
they
were
not
disclosed
and
instead
the
suit
was
dismissed.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
what
the
court...
what
the
exemption
means
and
what
the
court
said
in
sears
is
that
exemption
5
protects
against
documents,
disclosure
of
documents
that
would
not
be
routinely
disclosed
in
the
sense
that
are
not
subject
to
any
privilege.
but
work
product
documents,
even
the
documents
involved
in
this
case,
are
not
routinely
disclosed.
they
were
only
disclosed
in
the
americana
action
because
that
particular
plaintiff
was
able
to
make
a
sufficient
showing
of
need.
but
if--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
that
can't
be
what
the
exemption
means
or
what
this
court
meant
when
it
used
the
phrase
"normally
privileged",
or
else
it
would
wipe
out
all
qualified
privileges,
because
every
qualified
privilege
by
definition
can
be
overcome
by
a
sufficient
showing
of
need.
but
that's
not
the
category
of
documents
that
would
be
routinely
disclosed.
i
think
what
the
legislative
history
clearly
shows
is
that
exemption
5
was
meant
to
protect
documents
that
are
subject
to
absolute
or
qualified
privileges,
and
clearly
it
meant
to
encompass
documents
subject
to
the
work
product
privilege.
now,
the
d.c.
circuit
reversed
and,
even
though
it
agreed
that
these
documents
were
unquestionably
subject
to
the
work
product
privilege,
the
court
noted
that
the
americana
action,
the
action
as
to
which
these
documents
had
been
prepared,
had
ended.
and
the
court
announced
that
in
its
view
the
work
product
privilege
should
not
extend
beyond
the
termination
of
the
litigation
for
which
the
documents
were
prepared,
except
where
litigation
related
to
that
first
litigation
exists
or
potentially
exists.
the
court,
however,
quickly
rejected
the
notion
that
an
foia
suit
such
as
grolier's
here
could
be
considered
a
related
action,
and
then
it
announced
that
it
didn't
appear
that
there
were
any
other
related
actions
in
existence
or
on
the
horizon.
therefore,
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
reassess
the
work
product
claim
in
light
of
the
test
it
announced
in
regard
to
related
litigation
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
court
suggested
that
there
was
no
so-called
related
litigation
in
existence.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
plainly
wrong
for
two
independent
reasons:
first,
the
court's
interpretation
of
the
duration
of
the
work
product
privilege
is
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
the
underlying
purposes
of
the
privilege,
and
it
creates
a
test
that's
frankly
unworkable.
and
second,
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
correct
in
its
ruling
as
to
the
temporal
scope
of
the
work
product
privilege
and
the
fact
that
it's
not
perpetual
in
civil
discovery,
that
wouldn't
mean
that
those
same
qualifications
exist
under
the
foia
because,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
in
responding
to
the
question
of
justice
o'connor,
documents
may
be
obtained
under
the
foia
only
if
they
would
be
routinely
discoverable
in
civil
litigation,
in
other
words
not
subject
to
any
privilege.
and
even
under
the
d.c.
circuit's
newfangled
work
product
test,
attorney
work
product
from
terminated
litigation
would
not
be
routinely
disclosed
in
subsequent
litigation,
but
would
only
be
disclosed
when
certain
additional
criteria
are
met.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
court
has
suggested
in
cases
like
epa
against
mink
that
just
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
foia
litigation,
for
example,
the
plaintiff
needn't
make
any
showing
of
need.
the
civil
discovery
privileges
have
to
be
applied
by
way
of
rough
analogies.
but
with
the
work
product
privilege
it's
left
no
doubt
in
cases
such
as
sears
and
roebuck
and
federal
open
market
committee
that
exemption
5
was
plainly
intended
to
incorporate
the
work
product
privilege.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
under
the
foia
just
as
it
does
in
civil
litigation,
and
it's
quite
clear
that
work
product
is
always
subject
to
a
privilege.
it
may
only
be
a
qualified
privilege,
especially
when
we're
dealing
with
non-opinion
work
product.
but
there
really
is
no
uncertainty,
i
think,
as
to
this
aspect
of
exemption
5
that
it's
not
routinely
discoverable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that's
one
of
the
severe
problems
with
applying
the
d.c.
circuit's
related
litigation
test
in
the
context
of
a
foia
case,
which
i
hope
to
get
to
in
a
little
while.
but
it's
clear
from
sears
and
roebuck
that
the
work
product
privilege
applies
in
the
foia
context
and
that
a
plaintiff's
need
for
it
is
to
be
assessed
under
the
least
compelling
circumstances.
in
other
words,
it's
analogized
to
a
plaintiff
who
in
civil
discovery
could
show
nothing
more
than
mere
relevance.
and
it's
quite
clear
that
in
civil
discovery
a
plaintiff
who
can
show
nothing
more
than
mere
relevance
is
not
entitled
to
work
product,
because
it's
subject
to
a
qualified
privilege
and
he
has
to
show
more
than
mere
relevance,
he
has
to
show
need
and
hardship.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
it
does.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
as
to
certain
documents
the
government
did,
as
to
the
work
product
documents
in
this
case.
many
of
them
are
memoranda,
for
example,
either
to
the
files
or
memoranda
that
are
not
being
written
to
a
final
decisionmaker
but
are
merely
being
written
in
order
to
assess
various
aspects
of
a
particular
litigation,
and
therefore
those
documents
may
not
fall
within
the
deliberative
process
privilege,
although
they
would
seem
clearly
to
fall
within
the
work
product
privilege,
as
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held.
so
while
in
some
categories
of
cases
there
may
be
an
overlap
between
the
two
privileges,
in
this
case
i
don't
think
there
is
an
overlap
and
in
a
great
many
cases
there
wouldn't
be
an
overlap.
all
the
government
would
have
available
to
it
would
be
the
work
product
privilege.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
exemption
7
has
a
number
of
facets
to
it.
not
only
do
you
have
to
show
that
there's
a
pending
enforcement
action,
but
you
also
have
to
show
that
it
falls
into
one
of
the
other
categories
of
documents
that
are
protected
from
mandatory
disclosure,
and
no
exemption
7
claim
was
made
here.
but
it's
quite
clear
this
was
work
product
and
congress
intended
work
product
to
be
incorporated
within
exemption
5.
that
is
one
of
the
very
few
things
that
is
absolutely
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
the
foia
and
from
this
court's
decisions
interpreting
that
exemption.
now,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
discussing
the
first
of
the
flaws
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
principal
purpose
of
the
work
product
privilege
is
to
create
a
zone
of
privacy
within
which
a
lawyer
can
prepare
his
case
without
having
to
worry
that
the
memos
he
writes
will
later
be
freely
disclosed
to
his
adversaries
in
a
way
that
could
harm
him
or
his
clients.
this
court
in
the
seminal
case
of
hickman
against
taylor
explained
the
harms
that
would
occur
to
the
adversary
system
if
work
product
materials
were
not
subject
to
at
least
a
qualified
privilege
in
civil
discovery.
attorneys
would
be
reluctant
to
put
their
thoughts
down
in
writing
and
inefficiency
and
unfairness
would
inevitably
develop
in
the
giving
of
legal
advice
and
in
the
preparation
of
cases
for
trial.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
think
it
would
be
the
lawyer.
it's
to
protect
the
legal
system.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
here
the
lawyer
and
the
client...
it's
hard
to
distinguish
in
government
litigation.
the
privilege
is
intended
to
protect
the
lawyer,
the
process
by
which
the
lawyer
puts
his
case
together.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
many
of
the
documents
that
are
put
together
would
be
quite
harmful
to
the
client
if
disclosed
and
the
lawyer
might
have
a
fiduciary
obligation
not
to
disclose
those
documents
in
a
way
that
would
harm
the
client.
but
i
would
imagine
in
a
case
involving
a
waiver
question,
which
this
case
doesn't
raise,
you
would
look
perhaps
as
to
whether
the
lawyer
has
made--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
papers
that
were
being
prepared
were
not
his
personal
papers.
they're
the
papers
of
the
government.
i'm
not
sure
he
could
take
them
with
him
and
freely
disclose
them.
in
government
litigation
it's
somewhat
different
than
perhaps
in
private
practice.
but
this
case
certainly
doesn't
raise
any
question
of
waiver
of
the
privilege.
if
for
example
the
government
had
disclosed
these
documents
in
the
americana
litigation
in
response
to
the
discovery
order,
perhaps
there
would
be
a
question
of
waiver
in
a
subsequent
foia
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
would
be
the
property
of
the
government,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
in
terms
of
ownership?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
answering
justice
stevens'
question
in
the
context
of
government
litigation.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
material
to
the
outcome
of
a
case
such
as
this
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
i
mean,
the
freedom
of
information
act
only
applies
to
government
documents.
quite
clearly
these
are
government
documents.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
he
may
not
take--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct,
and
in
that
sense
he
would
not
be
free
to
waive.
if
that's
the
sense
of
justice
stevens'
question,
he
would
not
be
free
to
waive
the
work
product
that
adheres
in
any
papers
that
belong
to
the
government.
but
there's
really
no
question
of
waiver
of
any
sort
in
this
case.
now,
the
concerns
that
i
was
mentioning
earlier
about
why
there
is
a
work
product
privilege
in
the
first
place
are
perhaps
most
compelling
during
the
period
when
a
case
is
being
litigated,
but
it
seems
to
us
it's
equally
clear
that
many
of
the
harms
that
the
work
product
privilege
is
designed
to
avoid
would
be
almost
as
likely
to
occur
if
the
privilege
were
to
end
with
the
termination
of
the
litigation
for
which
the
documents
were
prepared,
because
attorneys
would
still
be
reluctant
to
commit
certain
thoughts
to
writing
if
they
realized
that
they'd
have
to
share
those
thoughts
with
an
opponent
at
any
time,
not
just
while
the
case
is
alive.
and
if
attorneys
did
prepare
memoranda
that
might
reflect
unfavorably
on
them
or
their
clients
or
their
legal
theories,
they
perhaps
would
have
a
tremendous
incentive
to
destroy
those
documents
at
the
time
the
case
ended
if
the
work
product
privilege
ended
at
the
same
time.
this
took
would
lead
to
inefficiencies
in
the
giving
of
legal
advice
or
in
the
preparation
of
cases
for
trial.
the
principal
reason
that's
generally
given
for
construing
privileges
narrowly
is
that
it
inhibits
the
search
for
truth.
but
it's
hard
to
see
how
the
search
for
truth
would
be
enhanced
by
a
rule
that
led
people
to
destroy
documents
rather
than
take
a
chance
that
they
might
have
to
be
turned
over
at
some
later
time.
so
essentially
for
these
reasons,
there's
unanimity
or
general
agreement
among
the
lower
courts
that
the
work
product
privilege
really
can't
cease
at
the
time
the
litigation
ceases,
but
has
to
to
some
extent
retain
its
privilege
status
thereafter.
even
the
d.c.
circuit
agreed
with
that
in
this
case,
because
they
held
that
the
privilege
survives
in
certain
instances
where
there's
related
litigation
or
potential
for
related
litigation.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
that
test
is
not
responsive
to
the
concerns
that
underlie
the
work
product
privilege
and
it's
not
at
all
workable
in
practice.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
plainly
wrong
to
conclude
that
the
harms
associated
with
allowing
discovery
of
work
product
are
limited
to
discovery
in
so-called
related
actions.
the
harm
can
be
equally
as
great
when
discovery
is
made
in
a
so-called
unrelated
action.
but
even
if
we
were
to
accept
the
court
of
appeals'
premise
that
there
are
differences
about
so-called
related
and
unrelated
actions,
the
principal
flaw
in
the
d.c.
circuit's
test
is
that
it's
impossible
to
apply
the
test.
there
would
be
no
certainty.
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
degree
of
certainty,
predictability
as
to
the
scope
of
the
protection,
if
the
work
product
privilege
is
going
to
achieve
the
results
that
justify
its
existence
in
the
very
first
place.
the
court
observed
in
hickman
against
taylor
that
if
attorneys
know
that
their
work
product
is
subject
to
discovery
they'll
behave
in
a
way
that
would
necessarily
be
harmful
to
the
adversary
system.
and
many
of
the
harmful
consequences
the
privilege
is
designed
to
avoid
are
therefore
the
result
of
what
a
lawyer
can
reasonably
anticipate
at
the
time
he's
putting
the
materials
together.
certainty
as
to
the
scope
of
the
privilege
is
therefore
essential.
this
court
said
in
a
closely
related
context
in
the
upjohn
case
just
a
couple
of
terms
ago
that
a
privilege
that's
uncertain
in
scope
or
that
leads
to
widely
varying
results
in
seemingly
similar
cases
is
really
no
better
than
no
privilege
at
all.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
if
a
particular
showing
of
need
is
made.
that
only
says,
justice
o'connor,
that
it's
a
qualified
privilege,
that
the
balance
is
not
as
strongly
tipped
in
one
direction.
but
that
qualified
privilege
even
applies
during
the
time
that
the
litigation
is
alive,
and
all
we're
saying
is
that
it
should
retain
its
qualifiedly
privileged
status
later.
there's
always
going
to
be
some
uncertainty
when
you're
dealing
with
qualified
privileges,
and
we
agree
to
that.
but
the
d.c.
circuit
has
extended,
expanded
the
level
of
uncertainty
to
the
situation
where
it
would
be
totally
unworkable.
a
lawyer
wouldn't
know
at
the
time
he's
putting
papers
together
whether
some
later
judge
might
find
that
some
litigation
he
has
no
notion
is
even
going
to
arise
is
a
related
litigation,
and
he
has
no
reason
to
know
whether
there's
a
potential
for
related
litigation
years
later
when
someone's
seeking
access.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
is
what
congress
intended.
that...
first
of
all,
what
i
said
about
what
exemption
5
means
is
i
think
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
sears,
in
nlrb
against
sears
and
roebuck,
in
which
they
said,
the
court
said,
that
a
requester
under
the
foia
is
to
be
judged,
is
to
be
put
in
the
place
of
a
person
in
civil
litigation
with
the
least
compelling
need
for
the
information.
in
other
words,
someone
who
cannot
make
any
showing
of
need,
who
cannot
overcome
any
qualified
privileges.
and
i'd
say
it
would
be
quite
bizarre
if
that
wasn't
what
congress
intended,
because
if
that
wasn't
what
congress
intended
congress
would
have
been
repealing
the
work
product
privilege
and
every
other
qualified
privilege
in
government
litigation,
because
it
would
mean
that
any
person
in
litigation
with
the
government
who
couldn't
make
the
showing
of
need
necessary
to
overcome
the
privilege
in
civil
litigation
would
just
file
an
foia
request
and
he
would
get
it.
it's
quite
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
that's
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
i
should
add
that
this
whole
notion
of
work
product
privilege
as
restricted
to
so-called
related
cases
is
based
on
a
rather
myopic
and
i
think
naive
view
of
litigation,
especially
government
litigation,
because
especially
with
government
litigation
it's
hardly
the
case
that
the
government's
interests
end
when
a
particular
case
ends.
each
case
is
generally
part
of
a
much
larger
litigative
scheme.
in
this
case,
for
example,
this
unfair
method
of
competition
case
against
americana
was
just
part
of
the
ftc's
continuing
efforts
to
police
the
marketplace
to
eliminate
deceptive
practices,
and
much
of
the
work
product
is
not
related
to
one
particular
case
but
may
lay
out
the
government's
litigative
strategies
in
a
whole
range
of
cases.
it
would
be
quite
useful
to
potential
adversaries
of
the
government
or
regulatees
to
wait
until
some
case
terminates
and
then
get
the
work
product
for
that
case.
in
fact,
grolier
in
this
very
case
is
not
particularly
shy
about
why
it
wants
this
work
product.
in
its
complaint
which
is
reprinted
at
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix,
grolier
says
that
it
wants
the
information
in
this
case
which
is
subject
to
the
work
product
privilege
because
grolier
is
a
respondent
in
an
above-mentioned
adjudicative
proceeding
that
was
then
before
the
ftc,
and
plaintiff,
that
is
grolier,
believes
that
such
records
may
have
some
bearing
on
certain
issues
raised
in
that
proceeding.
and
in
a
letter
that
grolier
sent
contemporaneously
to
the
ftc
in
connection
with
its
foia
request
for
these
work
product
documents,
it
says:
"we
seek
access
to
the
records
in
question
because
we
believe
such
records
may
have
some
bearing
on
certain
issues
raised
in
another
pending
ftc
proceeding
against
grolier
raising
similar
sorts
of
unfair
method
of
competition
issues.
"
so
i
think
it
would
be
devastating
and
it
could
not
have
been
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
that
this
sort
of
work
product
material
would
have
to
be
given
over
even
if
the
case,
one
case,
may
technically
have
ended.
finally,
the
related
litigation
test
is
flawed
because
it's
wholly
unresponsive
to
the
concerns
underlying
the
privilege,
because
it
ignores
the
fact
that
subsequent
unrelated
litigation
often
precedes
the
institution
of
related
litigation.
and
if
the
foia
request
were
made
at
the
time
when
there
was
no
litigation
pending,
then
the
materials
would
have
to
be
given
over
and
then
people
could
use
that
to
bring
a
related
suit.
that's
precisely
what
the
work
product
privilege
is
designed
to
prevent,
is
the
use
of
one
lawyer's
opinions,
thought
processes,
legal
research,
for
the
purpose
of
helping
his
adversary
bring
a
lawsuit.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
a
number
of
responses
to
that.
one
is
that
that
is
an
issue
that's
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
case.
there's
no
proof
that
there
was
any
unethical
conduct
in
this
case.
they
never
made
that
argument
below.
the
district
court
in
the
americana
litigation
found
no
unethical
conduct.
the
district
court
in
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there's
nothing
unethical
or
illegal
about
that.
the
word
"informer"
is
a
somewhat
loaded
phrase.
the
appendix
contains
a
discussion
of
what
this
so-called
covert
investigation
was
at
pages
42
and
43.
but
even
if
i
were
to
pursue
it
for
a
moment
with
you,
justice
stevens,
that
perhaps
some
of
this
work
product
would
be
subject
in
civil
litigation
to
being
overcome
by
proof
that
it
was
put
together
perhaps,
you
know,
equivalent
to
a
fraud
or
exception
to
the
attorney-client
privilege,
it
still
wouldn't
mean
in
our
view
that
it
was
routinely
discoverable
in
civil
litigation,
because
it
would
still
be
presumptively
privileged.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
if
he
has
to
show
something
more
than
relevance
in
the
civil
litigation
context.
but
this
is
an
argument
that
was
not
made
below.
it
is
not
the
basis
for
any
of
the
underlying
decisions
in
this
case.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
any
unethical
conduct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
it
would,
unless
you
reject
our
second
argument,
which
is
that
even
if
in
civil
discovery
a
sufficient
enough
showing
could
be
overcome...
could
be
made
to
overcome
the
privilege,
we
still
would
take
the
position
that
that
does
not
satisfy
the
congressional
test
of
being
routinely
discoverable,
because,
as
even
the
d.c.
circuit
agreed,
this
was
work
product
at
the
time
it
was
prepared.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
the
documents
themselves
are
obviously
not
before
you.
but
there
is
an
index,
a
so-called
borne
index,
in
the
appendix,
which
is
on
pages
36
and
37
of
the
joint
appendix.
there
is
a
description
of
what
these
documents
are.
we
were
talking
about
documents
3,
5,
6
and
7.
those
are
the
four
documents
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
and
nobody
made
any
suggestions
that
they
were
the
product
of
any
sort
of
unethical
conduct.
this
is
something
that
grolier
has--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
am
not
aware
of
whether
the
record
has
them,
but
they're
certainly
not
freely
available,
and
there
is
a
borne
index
in
the
record
that
describes
what
they
are.
now,
i've
announced
many
of
the
problems
that
would
inhere
in
the
d.c.
circuit's
test.
but
that...
i've
just
been
discovering
that
test...
discussing
that
test
in
the
context
of
civil
discovery.
it
is
possible
to
figure
out
how
the
test
would
work
in
civil
discovery,
i
suppose,
because
there
really
have
to
be
two
lawsuits.
there's
lawsuit
one,
which
is
the
suit
in
which
the
documents
were
prepared;
then
there's
lawsuit
two,
which
is
the
suit
in
which
the
documents
are
being
sought.
and
i
suppose
some
judge
could
make
some
judgment
as
to
whether
suit
one
relates
to
suit
two
in
some
as
yet
undefined
way.
and
of
course
in
civil
litigation
the
person
seeking
the
documents
in
suit
two
would
have
to
make
some
showing
of
relevance,
and
that
would
help
the
judge
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
suit
one
was
related
to
suit
two.
but
i
have
no
idea
how
this
test
the
d.c.
circuit
announced
would
work
in
the
context
of
an
foia
request,
because
there
is
no
second
suit
in
an
foia,
in
the
foia
context.
the
d.c.
circuit
and
grolier
are
adamant
in
saying
that
an
foia
suit
can
never
be
a
related
suit.
so
if
i
understand
what
the
d.c.
circuit
is
saying
in
the
foia
context,
it
is
when
an
foia
request
comes
in
for
documents
in
a
previous
suit
the
agency
and
ultimately
the
courts
must
ask
themselves
whether
there
is
some
third
suit
in
existence
or
potentially
in
existence,
and
whether
the
third
suit
is
related
in
some
as
yet
undescribed
way
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
first
suit.
this
is
i
think
unworkable
in
practice.
we
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
that's
what
congress
meant
when
they
made
clear
that
exemption
5
incorporates
the
work
product
privilege,
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reject
that
view
of
the
work
product
privilege
in
the
context
of
a
foia
request.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
one
or
two
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
make
sure
there
are
no
misunderstandings
in
light
of
respondent's
argument.
we
do
take
the
position
that
under
exemption
5
documents
that
are
subject
to
a
qualified
privilege,
that
is
that
are
subject
to
the
work
product
privilege,
cannot
be
mandatorily
disclosed
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
in
other
words,
the
word
"routinely"
has
a
meaning
there.
the
fact
that
one
judge
in
one
particular
case
may
have
found
that
a
plaintiff
has
shown
the
need
doesn't
need
that
that
document
would
be
routinely
disclosed.
and
in
this
very
case,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
judge
fisher
in
the
americana
litigation
made
a
finding
defendant
had
substantial
need
for
the
documents.
no
suggestion
that
these
sorts
of
documents
would
be
routinely
disclosed.
unless
qualified
privileges
are
covered
by
exemption
5,
as
they
clearly
appear
to
be
by
the
legislative
history,
then
congress
would
have
effectively
repealed
qualified
privileges
such
as
the
work
product
privilege
or
the
confidential
commercial
information
privilege
at
issue
in
merrill
when
it
passed
the
freedom
of
information
act.
we
can't
believe
congress
intended
to
do
that.
now,
secondly,
respondent
has
suggested
many
times
that
this
is
a
very
narrow
decision,
it
only
applies
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
context.
and
it's
true
that
the
d.c.
circuit
sprinkled
in
a
few
places
in
its
opinion
the
suggestion
that
this
is
a
foia
case.
but
of
course,
there's
no
analytical
support
for
that
sort
of
a
distinction.
exemption
5
is
clearly
tied
right
to
civil
discovery.
the
legislative
history
and
this
court's
opinions
in
sears
and
roebuck...
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
footnote
16
in
sears
and
roebuck...
shows
that
the
exemption
is
intended
to
mirror
civil
discovery,
and
therefore
the
court
has
to
consider
not
only
the
foia
context
but
whether
this
is
a
workable
rule.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
mirrors
civil
discovery
in
terms
of
the
extent
of
the
privilege.
but
once
you
determine
that
there
is
a
privilege
there--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--then
you
never--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it's
quite...
it's
narrower
in
the
sense
that
no
showing
of
need
has
to
be
made
under
foia.
if
it's
privileged
at
all,
you
don't
look--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--to
see
whether
there's
some
plaintiff
somewhere
who
could
overcome
the
privilege,
because
that
would
read
the
privilege
out
of
the
statutes
in
terms
of
government
litigation.
thank
you.
