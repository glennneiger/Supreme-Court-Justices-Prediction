justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
mr.
geller,
in
the
earlier
action,
as
i
understand
it,
the
district
court
had
actually
ordered
that
the
documents
be
disclosed
under
rule
26;
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
can't
we
say
that
if
a
district
court
has
ordered
disclosure
then
that's
within
the
category
of
documents
referred
to
by
sears
that
are
routinely
disclosed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
suppose
they
are
routinely
disclosed
if
the
court
orders
them
to
be
disclosed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
geller,
does
exemption
5
also
encompass
material
that's
part
of
the
deliberative
process
within
a
government
agency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
could
the
government
have
claimed
a
privilege
under
that
aspect
of
the
rule
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
exemption
7
would
not
have
covered
the
government's
request
here,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
really
is
no
certainty,
is
there,
under
rule
26
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure?
there
are
provisions
whereby
someone
can
gain
access
to
documents.
