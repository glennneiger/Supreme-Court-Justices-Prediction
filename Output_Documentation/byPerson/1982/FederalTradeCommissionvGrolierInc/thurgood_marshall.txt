justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
geller,
i
don't
mean
to
be
technical,
but
whose
property
is
the
work
papers,
the
government's
or
the
lawyer's?
isn't
it
the
government's
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
mason,
didn't
you
a
few
minutes
ago
tell
the
chief
justice
you
were
not
raising
any
ethical
points?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
now
you're
raising
them.
