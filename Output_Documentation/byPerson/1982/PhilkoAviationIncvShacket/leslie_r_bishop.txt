mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
appeal
involves
a
suit
to
determine
the
ownership
of
a
1978
new
piper
navajo
airplane
sold
to
both
parties
in
the
suit
by
a
fraudulent
dealer.
plaintiff
shacket
brought
suit
in
the
u.s.
district
court
for
a
declaratory
judgment
seeking
a
determination
of
the
ownership
of
the
piper
navajo
airplane
in
him.
the
defendant
philko
aviation
counterclaimed
against
shacket.
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
aircraft,
the
district
court
awarded
ownership
to
the
plaintiff
shacket.
there
were
other
counts
of
fraud,
conspiracy,
wrongful
conversion,
and
requests
for
damages,
and
all
of
those
counts
were
held
by
the
lower
court
against
the
party
making
the
claim.
the
defendant
smith
and
smith
aircraft
sales,
inc.,
the
dealer
involved
in
this
dispute,
did
not
answer
or
plead
and
judgment,
default
judgment,
was
taken
against
that
defendant,
together
with
$29,000
attorney's
fees
in
favor
of
plaintiff
shacket.
philko
appealed
to
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
u.s.
district
court.
philko
subsequently
petitioned
to
this
honorable
court
by
writ
of
certiorari
and
that
certiorari
was
granted,
but
limited
to
the
first
issue
presented
by
the
petitioner
philko
as
to
the
question
presented:
does
state
law
permit
a
conveyance
of
title
to
aircraft
by
transfer
of
possession
alone,
without
the
necessity
of
faa
recording.
both
the
plaintiff
shacket
and
philko
through
mr.
edward
j.
mcardle,
its
president,
had
had
prior
dealings,
not
directly
related
to
this
lawsuit,
with
roger
smith
or
smith
aviation,
inc.,
the
dealer
involved.
mr.
shacket's
first
contact
with
smith
was
in
1972,
wherein
he
traded
one
aircraft
for
another,
and
that
was
in
smith's
context
as
a
dealer
of
used
aircraft.
mr.
mcardle
or
philko
or
corporations
related
to
mcardle
limited,
which
was
mr.
mcardle's
holding
company
for
several
business
corporations
engaged
in
the
leisure
time
business,
became
acquainted
on
a
chance
meeting
with
roger
smith
at
dupage
county
airport,
became
apprised
of
the
availability
for
purchase
of
a
fixed
base
operation
at
aurora
municipal
airport
in
aurora,
illinois,
and
subsequently
formed
a
new
delaware
corporation
called
philko
to
buy
the
assets
of
philko
aviation
in
aurora.
he
then
leased
that
facility
to
roger
smith
aircraft
sales,
inc.,
and
roger
smith
aircraft
sales,
inc.,
sold
fuel,
oil
and
service
under
the
trade
name
philko,
whereas
he
maintained
his
sale
of
used
aircraft
under
the
name
roger
smith
aircraft
sales,
inc.--
sometime
on
or
about
november
of
'77
roger
smith
persuaded
or
sold
a
new
1978
piper
navajo
airplane
to
shacket
by
means
of
a
purchase
order.
the
plane
had
not
at
that
time
been
manufactured.
the
purchase
order
was
signed
and
$20,000
was
deposited
by
shacket
at
that
time.
the
delivery
was
to
be
in
early
1978.
in
april
19th
of
1978,
shacket,
after
being
advised
the
plane
was
then
ready
for
delivery,
appeared
at
aurora
airport
from
his
home
in
detroit
preparatory
to
closing
and
taking
possession
of
the
aircraft.
at
that
time
mr.
shacket
paid
an
additional
$106,000
in
cash
and
he
had
at
a
prior
time
given
up
possession
to
a
1972
piper
navajo
airplane
which
was
to
be
used
as
the
trade-in.
so
that
the
total
consideration
paid
by
shacket
was
the
$20,000
at
the
time
of
execution
of
the
agreement,
$106,000
at
the
time
he
took
possession
and
the
delivery
into
roger
smith
aircraft,
inc.
's
hands
of
a
'72
piper
navajo
some
time
in
march
of
'78.
mr.
shacket
took
possession
of
the
aircraft--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--sir?
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
yes,
sir.
mr.
shacket
took
possession
of
the
airplane
after
being
shown
copies
of
the
title
documents
conveying
title
from
piper
in
a
complete
chain
up
to
and
including
smith
aviation,
inc.
smith
aviation,
inc.,
through
roger
smith,
provided
him
with
a
buyer's
copy
of
the
bill
of
sale
conveying
from
smith
aviation
to
maurice
shacket.
maurice
shacket
had
asked
for
the
original
documents.
he
was
told
that
they
weren't
ready.
he
returned
to
detroit,
but
left
his
friend
mr.
hamburg,
who
was
staying
a
day
later,
to
bring
the
copy.
the
same
story
was
told
to
mr.
hamburg,
who
did
not
get
the
original
documents
necessary
for
filing
with
the
faa.
next
day,
on
or
about
april
20th,
mr.
smith
takes
all
of
the
original
documents
necessary
to
file
with
the
faa
and
presents
them
to
mr.
mcardle,
with
the
story
that
he
was
going
to
try
to
borrow
$151,000
on
the
aircraft,
but
it
was
exceeding
his
line
of
credit.
mr.
mcardle
declined
through
his
corporation
to
extend
any
further
credit
to
roger
smith
aircraft,
but
did
agree
ultimately
to
buy
the
aircraft.
he
bought
the
aircraft
by
paying
$152,000
in
cash
and
cancelling
an
antecedent
debt
of
$60,000,
which
had
not
yet
become
due
but
which
was
shortly
to
become
due.
mr.
mcardle
did
so,
however,
only
after
his
bank,
who
was
the
provider
of
the
$152,000
cash
and
was
going
to
make
the
loan
on
the
aircraft,
inspected
the
documents,
determined
them
to
be
valid
documents,
had
checked
with
the
faa
recording
facility
in
oklahoma
city,
determined
that
the
piper
aircraft
had
been
manufactured
and
that
there
were
no
intervening
title
interests.
at
that
point
mr.
mcardle
authorized
the
disbursement
of
funds
for
the
loan
to
be
delivered
to
or
for
the
account
of
roger
smith
aircraft
sales.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
well,
we
have
a
slight
difference,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
shacket
was
perhaps
a
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
under
the
ucc.
philko
was
a
purchaser,
a
good
faith
purchaser
for
value.
the
difference
being
under
our
ucc,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
one
uses
an
antecedent
debt
as
part
of
the
consideration.
at
any
rate,
the
documents
were
duly
filed
with
the
faa
on
or
about
may
31st.
they
were
noted
as
filed
for
record.
about
june,
mid-june,
shacket
had
found
out
of
mcardle's
interest,
and
that
was
the
first
contact
mr.
mcardle
had
or
was
aware
of
shacket's
involvement
in
the
transaction.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
yes,
sir.
he
took
possession
of
the
airplane
at
the
time
he
paid
his
money.
mr.
mcardle
was
told
that
the
aircraft
was
in
michigan
with
a
piper
dealer
being
fitted
with
avionics.
we
have
here,
then,
a
conflict
between
the
illinois
uniform
commercial
code
and
the
federal
recording
statute.
section
49
u.s.c.--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--i'm
sorry?
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
not
entirely,
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
that
is
correct,
yes,
sir.
the
federal
statute
says
under
1403
that
no
document
will
be
accorded
validity
as
to
third
parties
without
notice
unless
and
until
it
is
filed
for
record.
shacket
never
filed
his
interest
for
record.
mcardle
or
philko,
looking
at
the
faa
records
through
its
bank,
finds
no
intervening
interest,
has
all
of
the
original
documents
in
its
hands,
duly
files
them
with
the
faa.
plaintiff...
shacket
makes
the
allegation,
well,
even
if
we
had
sent
them
down
for
recording
you
would
not
have
known
in
time.
but
that
really
begs
the
question,
because
if
they'd
been
sent
down
for
proper
recording
at
oklahoma
city
you
wouldn't
have
had
the
documents
in
smith's
hands
to
perpetrate
the
fraud
in
philko.
so
we
have
an
interplay
here
of
two
statutes,
one
under
the
illinois
uniform
commercial
code
that
would
purport
to
pass
title
by
possession
of
the
document,
and
the
enactment
of
1401
and
1403
which
require
the
registration
of
an
owner
of
aircraft,
and
upon
that
registration
under
1401
either
having
the
document
recorded
under
1403
or
having
recordable
documents
under
1403.
shacket
takes
the
position
that
if
you
look
at
1406
you
are
directed
to
the
state
law
in
which
the
document
is
delivered.
1406
was
enacted
in
1964
to
solve
a
problem
that
dealt
with
the
choice
of
law
to
determine
the
respective
rights
or
validities
of
the
parties
of
the
contract.
that
is
to
say
that
you
had
a
choice
of
where
the
aircraft
was
located,
you
had
a
choice
of
the
place
of
execution
or
place
of
delivery.
1406,
appropriately,
we
think,
chose
the
place
of
delivery
of
the
document
as
the
most
logical
choice
for
highly
mobile,
highly
valuable
pieces
of
machinery,
where
often
consortiums
of
lenders,
60
or
more,
get
together.
one
reads
the
congressional
record
and
you
come
away
with
the
inescapable
conclusion
that,
in
their
analysis
of
enacting
1406,
they
are
viewing
1406
as
a
choice
of
law,
a
federal
choice
of
law
as
to
the
parties
to
that
agreement
to
determine
validity.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
well,
it's
a
question
i
think
where
we
have
our
problem,
mr.
justice,
is
that
if
you
have
resort
to
state
law
for
substantive
ownership
rights,
you've
gone
beyond
the
scope
of
1406.
the
determination
of
validity
is,
quite
properly
i
think,
limited
to
the
execution:
is
it
proper,
does
it
properly
describe
the
asset,
does
it
meet
the
test
of
that
jurisdiction
in
which
it's
delivered,
and,
analyzed
from
the
two
parties
that
are
involved
in
that
particular
instrument,
does
it
meet
the
test
as
a
valid
instrument?
obviously,
you
must
have
some
machinery
to
eliminate
fraudulent
acts.
but
the
minute
you
logically
extend
1406
into
the
substantive
law
of
the
state,
now
you're
giving
credence
to
a
transfer
of
ownership,
if
you
will,
without
having
recorded
it
under
1403.
and
1403
says
no
interest
in
any
aircraft
will
be
valid
unless
recorded
in
1403.
so
1406
can't
be
used
to
bypass
the
effect
of
recording
under
1403
without
making
1403
almost
a
useless
tool.
the
object
of
recording
was
to
provide
for
the
government
and
for
the
aviation
industry
a
rather
neat
set
of
rules
whereby
lenders
could
take
some
comfort
in
the
status
of
title;
whereby
investment
capital
would
flow
in
in
such
a
way
that
lenders
or
investors
would
be
reasonably
certain
to
have
an
interest
in
the
specific
chattel
that
they're
looking
at;
and
so
that
the
government
would
be
empowered
to
send
out
notices
to
owners
of
defects
discovered
by
the
federal
aviation
administration.
and
how
could
it
do
it
if--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--yes,
sir,
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
those
documents
are
properly
executed
under
illinois
law
and
that
they
are
the
original
documents
to
the
transactions
that
they
purport
to
represent.
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
but
the
validity
of
those
documents
does
not
mean
that
you
allow
the
substantive
state
law
to
operate
beyond
the
parties
to
those
instruments
or
beyond
the
scope
of
them
to
divest
what
would
appear
to
be
the
titleholder.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
no,
sir.
1403
was
in
a
sense
part
of
the
1926
act--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--it
was
voluntary.
it
became
really
in
its
present
form
as
you
now
know
it
in
1938.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
1964,
1964.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
do
both
sections?
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
validity
or
valid,
yes.
the
determination
of
validity.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
oh,
yes,
i
think
so.
but
in
looking
at
them,
mr.
justice,
you're
looking...
when
you're
talking
about
1406
you're
talking
about
the
validity
of
a
document.
there
are
parties
to
the
document,
and
the
analysis
of
the
validity
of
that
document--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--1403,
you're
talking
about
any
document,
and
you
are
talking
about
the
substantive
rights
of
the
whole
world
apart
from
the
document.
that
is
to
say,
any
right
affecting
aircraft
must
be,
if
it
is
going
to
enjoy
validity,
it
must
be
recorded
under
1403.
there
is
no
interplay--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
in
this
context,
i
mean
third
parties
without
notice.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
the
result
would
be
otherwise,
that
is
quite
correct,
sir.
the
notice...
returning
to
1406,
1406
can
only
operate
if
you
have
a
recorded
document
under
1403,
because
if
you
don't
have
a
document
under
1403
it
isn't
valid
by
operation
of
1403.
so
you
must
have
something
of
record.
otherwise
you
have
what
would
essentially
be
a
useless
recording
statute,
because
some
items
would
be
a
matter
of
record
and
some
need
not
be
a
matter
of
record.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
i'm
sorry?
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
we
are
saying
that
this
1403
is
not
framed
in
language--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--that's
quite
so.
it
may
even
go
further
than
that.
if
shacket
had
just
taken
the
photocopies
that
he
had
and
made
them
part
of
the
record,
he
might
have
muddied
the
waters
sufficient
to
have
alerted
a
wary
person.
but
the
requirements
of
1403,
mr.
justice,
are
that
you
must
file
the
original
documents.
the
original
documents
are
what
roger
smith
delivered
to
mr.
mcardle
and
mr.
mcardle
on
behalf
of
philko
delivered
to
the
sandwich
state
bank.
and
there
is
no
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
those
documents.
if
you
look
at
1403,
it
is
to
advise
the
wide
world
of
the
recorded
status
or
title
or
security
interest
in
an
aircraft.
1406
was
an
attempt
by
congress,
and
i
think
a
very
excellent
attempt,
to
develop
a
choice
of
forum
so
that...
not
a
choice
of
forum,
but
a
choice,
a
federal
choice
of
law
so
that
you
could
determine
the
validity
of
a
document.
they
examined
in
the
congressional
deliberations
at
great
length
what
the
alternatives
were
and
gave
some
almost
scary
examples
of
the
problems
engendered
with,
say,
a
small
airline
fleet
flying
over
the
country,
trying
to
make
a
mortgage
with
a
consortium
of
banks
out
of
new
york.
they
discussed
the
problems
with
analyzing
the
transaction
from
the
location
of
the
aircraft,
some
of
which
were
in
the
air
and
operational
at
the
time,
and
the
choice
of
law
keyed
into
the
point
of
execution,
but
often
you
have
multiple
signers
of
a
document
in
different
locations,
and
finally
came
to
the
resolution
that
the
one
thing
that
generally
happened
to
any
document
about
one
time
was
its
delivery,
and
it
wasn't
an
effective
instrument
in
most
every
jurisdiction
until
delivery.
so
1406
very
correctly
selected
the
place
of
delivery
as
the
federal
choice
of
law
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
document.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
not
really,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
if
you
look
at
it
it
may
be
as
simple
an
explanation
as
a
term
of
art.
there
is
no
requirement
under
1403
as
such
that
you
must
file.
that's
under
1401
and
it
involves
then
the
registration
of
the
aircraft
which
is
necessary
to
operate
it.
but
it
also
says
under
1401
that
this
shall
not
be
determinative
of
any
title
if
that
title
is
in
dispute.
then
you
drop
down
to
1403
and,
while
there
is
no
affirmative
compelling
statutory
language
to
record
under
1403,
it
very
clearly
says
that
if
you
don't
record
the
instrument
isn't
valid
as
to
third
parties
without
notice...
clearly,
as
much
a
penalty
clause
as
one
could
hope
for.
and
if
you
have
no
validity
for
an
unrecorded
instrument,
whether
that
transaction
is
represented
by
a
document
or
not,
if
1403
says
you
have
no
validity
you
have
nothing
to
consider
under
the
statute.
and
yet
you
look
at
the
various
state
statutes
that
deal
with
personal
property
and
that
transfers
personal
property
all
over
the
place
by
delivery
of
possession.
i
think
it's
clearly
apparent
from
the
congressional
record
that
they
did
not
want
to
have
aircraft
or
aircraft
financing
the
subject
matter
of
non-recorded
transactions.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
the
mortgage
convention?
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
the
treaty.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
the
treaty
does
not
affect
the
operation
of
this
case.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
no,
i
would
not
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice.
if
you--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--i
would
not
agree
with
that.
in
looking
at
the
congressional
record,
what
congress
is
trying
to
do
here,
mr.
justice,
is
create
a
satisfactory
forum
for
the
flow
of
investment
money
or
capital.
i
cannot
conceive
under
the
current
state
of
the
case
law
where
any
lender
would
make
a
loan
on
anything
other
than
the
borrower's,
the
individual's
credit.
he
isn't
looking...
he
always
takes,
of
course,
a
security
interest
in
the
aircraft.
but
it
is
such
a
frail
thing,
if
you
can
pass
it
around
and
defeat
it
under
uniform
commercial
codes
or
pass
title
around
by
other
than
non-recorded
documents--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--well,
i
think
you
have,
as
we
suggested
in
our
brief,
mr.
justice,
a
race-notice
statute.
from
the
original
enactment
of
1403,
which
originally
provided
for
validity
upon
recordation,
that
was
subsequently
changed
in
1940...
1976,
to
be
keyed
into
the
filing
for
record,
rather
than
recording,
and
mandated
the
faa
to
keep
a
register
of
all
documents
filed
for
record.
now,
it
would
seem
not
really
important
unless
it
was
in
congress'
mind
to
establish
a
priority
of
the
filing
of
documents.
and
they
don't
come
out
and
say
that,
we're
going
to
establish
a
priority,
but
the
structure
of
the
whole
thing,
if
you
look
at
it,
can't
really
effectively
operate
from
its
congressional
intent
standpoint
unless
you
have
a
race-notice
statute.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
it
was
actually,
we
found
out
later,
in
mr.
shacket's
hands
back
in
detroit.
we
don't
know
exactly
where
it
was,
but
it
had
been
delivered
to
him
or
given
to
him
either
one
or
three
days
before
the
actual
transaction
with
our
client.
our
client
had
been
told
that
the
aircraft
was
with
a
piper
dealer
in
michigan
being
fitted
with
avionics.
for
a
new
airplane,
your
honor,
that's
a
rather
normal
thing
to
have
happen.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
mechanic's
liens?
any
and
all,
the
statute
says,
any
and
all
interests
to
or
affecting
aircraft
shall
be
recorded.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
of
the
claim.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
if
that
claim
is
not
a
matter
of
record,
i
would
say
to
you--
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
--under
the
federal
act,
yes,
sir,
that
i
would
say
that
anybody
who
is
not
on
notice
should
not
have
to
deal
with
that
claim.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
yes,
sir.
and
if
the
court
adopts
the
rule
as
we
think
it
should
be
or
congress
intended,
rather,
you
will
find
the
procedure,
i
think,
in
transactions
where
all
aircraft
are
financed
through
escrows,
the
document
is
recorded
first
and
the
money
disbursed
later.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
yes,
he
must
retain
possession
to
assert
his
lien.
but
here
you
come
again
into
a
conflict
between
1403
and
state
lien
law.
1403
says
the
interest
must
be
recorded,
any
and
all
interests.
mr.
leslie
r.
bishop
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
how...
where
would
you
search?
it's
a
practical
problem.
where
would
you
begin?
but
i
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
statutory
language
expressly
says
that
you
look
to
the
validity
of
the
document
without
regard
to
the
location
or
presence
of
the
aircraft.
the
whole
idea
of
1406
was
to
get
away
from
physical
delivery
of
possession.
it
becomes
eminently
impractical
when
you're
thinking
of
a
boeing
747
on
a
route
between
miami
and
lisbon.
how
is
the
airline
going
to
finance
it
in
a
new
york
bank
unless
you
have
the
rule
and
the
rule
is
the
law
that
congress
enacted?
