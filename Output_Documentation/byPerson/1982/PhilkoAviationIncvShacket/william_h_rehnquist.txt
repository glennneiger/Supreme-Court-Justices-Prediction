justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
all
of
these
facts
are
really
essential
to
resolve
the
legal
issue
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bishop,
i
think
you've
got
some
problems
in
your
argument
with
the
language
of
section
1406.
it
says
"the
validity
of
any
instrument
the
recording
of
which
is
provided
for
by
section
503.
"
"shall
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state.
"
now,
why
shouldn't
the
ucc
govern
as
to
priorities
under
that
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
most
state
laws
require
that
a
mechanic,
to
preserve
a
lien
on
a
moving
vehicle,
has
to
retain
possession
of
it?
he
doesn't
file
a
lien.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
philko
claims
that
it's
being
stripped
of
its
rights
to
its
new
aircraft.
i
mean,
both
of
the
parties
probably
have
equities.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
real
issue
that
contained
in
the
remark
you
just
made,
i
think,
isn't
it?
what
did
congress
intend--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--with
respect
to
two
people,
each
with
presumably
very
substantial
equities.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
your
argument
that
there
was
no
interest
to
convey
at
the
time
it
was
conveyed,
isn't
that
essentially
based
on
a
recording
statute
rather
than
a
substantive
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
really
say
the
federal
statute
essentially
just
tells
you
where
to
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
everything
that
follows
from
recording,
beyond
the
mere
act
of
recording,
still
depends
on
state
law
under
1406.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
that's
fairly
ambiguous,
isn't
it,
for
these
purposes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mention
in
your
brief,
mr.
murray,
section
1403(d).
but
i
don't
believe
either
you
or
your
opponent
have
argued
it
at
any
length.
do
you
derive
some
comfort
from
that
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
where
it
talks
about
something
being
valid.
the
catch
title
is
"effective
recording".
i
would
have
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
have
derived
some
comfort
from
it.
it's
on
page
14
of
your
brief.
