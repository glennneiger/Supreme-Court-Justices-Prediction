justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bishop,
i
am
concerned
by
the
legislative
history,
which
you
have
not
really
mentioned.
the
original
senate
bill
contained
a
clear
provision
saying
that
every
instrument
so
recorded
will
have
priority
over
all
other
claims
arising
afterwards.
the
congress
knew
how
to
draft
language
that
would
have
clearly
required
priority
effect
here
and
that
language
was
dropped
from
the
legislation.
and
in
the
maritime
bill
congress
clearly
provided
for
priorities.
in
the
motor
vehicle
registration
it
did
not.
it
had
the
language
to
do
it
here
and
took
it
out.
now
you're
asking
us
to
write
it
back
in.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
may
have
been
concerned
more
with
having
a
central
registry
than
with
requiring
the
priorities.
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
the
mortgage
convention
affects
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
treaty
dealing
with--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
murray,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
did
refer
to
the
mortgage
convention,
the
treaty,
and
indicated
that
it
may
have
had
some
application
or
affect
here.
and
while
you
and
your
opponent
didn't
really
deal
with
it,
it
did
seem
to
have
some
potential
application
and
conceivably
could
be
read
to
require
not
a
single
recording
system,
but
a
recognition
of
priority
for
recorded
interests.
would
you
like
to
comment
on
that?
