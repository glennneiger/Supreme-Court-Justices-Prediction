shacket
had
the
airplane,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
that,
except
for
the
federal
law,
the
right
result
was
reached
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
were
no
federal
recording
statute,
the
result
reached
below
would
be
correct
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
it
wouldn't
concern
us,
because
it
would
be
a
matter
of
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
focus
is
on
the
impact
of
the
federal
statute.
justice

white
were
1403
and
1406
passed
at
the
same
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
when
did--
justice
byron
r.
white
--when
did
1406
come
along?
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
and
both
sections
use
the
word,
either
"validity"
or
"valid",
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
transfer--
justice
byron
r.
white
--don't
you
have
to
say
that
the
validity
means
different
things
in
those
two
sections?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
talking
about
in
1403?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wouldn't
be
only
useless,
would
it?
suppose
it
had
been
filed.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
shacket
papers
had
been
filed
with
the
faa.
i
suppose
that
filing
would
have
had
some
operative
consequences.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
client
wouldn't
be
in
the
fix
he
is
if
shacket
had
filed
his
papers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
1403
mean,
then?
it
says
no
instrument
shall
be
valid.
that's
just...
doesn't
that
have
some
substantive
bite?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
that
word
"valid"
just
has
no
force
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
have
to
look
to
state
law
for
every
substantive
consequence
of
the
filing?
