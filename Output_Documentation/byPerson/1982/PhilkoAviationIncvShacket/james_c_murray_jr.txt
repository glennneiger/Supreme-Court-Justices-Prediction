mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
essence,
this
case
only
requires
this
court
to
consider
basically
four
factors,
four
factors
that
are
determined,
already
determined,
either
by
the
u.s.
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
and
are
reflected
in
the
depositions
that
were
taken
in
this
case.
it
is
undisputed
that
philko
aviation
recorded
bills
of
sale,
the
original
bills
of
sale.
whether
mr.
mcardle
saw
the
original
bills
of
sale
at
the
time
he
consummated
his
transaction
is
a
question,
but
it's
unimportant
for
this
court
to
determine
the
issue
before
it.
the
second
fact
is
that
my
client
on
april
19th,
1978,
took
possession
of
his
$235,000
custom-made
vanity
number
aircraft,
flew
it
off
from
aurora
airport
and
flew
it
to
detroit,
and
he
has
been
in
possession
of
that
aircraft
since
that
time.
the
third
fact
that
this
court
has
to
look
at
is
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
based
upon
this
record,
determined
that
my
clients
had
title
interest
in
this
aircraft
under
state
law
under
two
separate
theories:
one,
it
was
a
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business;
and
second,
it
was
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value.
the
fourth
factor
is
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
philko
aviation
was
not
a
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
and
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
it
was
not
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value.
and
let
me
address
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you
asked
mr.
bishop
regarding
whether
or
not
philko
aviation
was
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value.
it
is
clear
under
illinois
law
that
it
would
not
be,
and
the
reason
under
2-401,
subparagraph
(2)
of
the
uniform
commercial
code,
there
is
one
element.
although
mr.
bishop
is
correct,
he
did
give
value
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
an
antecedent
debt,
if
he
cancelled
it...
and
that's
a
question...
if
he
had
cancelled
the
antecedent
debt,
that
would
give
value.
but
what
he
didn't
tell
you
is
the
fact
that
under
illinois
law
you
have
to
physically
take
possession
of
the
goods,
the
delivery
of
the
goods.
and
the
code
speaks,
that
section
of
the
code
speaks,
about
physical
delivery
of
the
goods.
it
doesn't
talk
about
delivery.
those
are
the
essential--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--there
has
been
no
ruling.
and
to
answer
your
question,
justice
stevens,
i
do
not
believe
so.
under
article
9
of
the
uniform
commercial
code...
and
that
issue
was
not
raised--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--yes,
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
you.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
i
would
ask...
and
i
would
suggest
to
you,
justice
stevens,
that
you
would
have
to
focus
your
attention
on
whether
or
not
this
secured
party
who
took
an
interest
in
an
aircraft,
whether
or
not...
as
you
know,
under
the
code
you
have
certain
elements
in
order
for
a
security
interest
to
attach.
one
of
those
interests
is
that
your
borrower
has
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
aircraft.
their
interest
is
predicated
on
the
bill
of
sale
between
philko
aviation
and
roger
smith
aircraft
sales.
under
illinois
law
it
is
clear
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
that
that
conveyance...
that
roger
smith
had
nothing
to
convey
under
that
instrument,
and
there
was
nothing
to
convey.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
and
i
don't...
first
of
all,
if
you're
suggesting
that
this
case,
in
order
for
that
issue
to
be
determined,
should
be
remanded
for
further
consideration,
i
would
suggest
to
you,
justice
stevens,
that
that
is
unnecessary,
because
all
the
facts
in
this
case
are
in
the
record.
and
my
analysis--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--i
agree
with
you,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
should
decide
it.
but
if
that...
but
you
had
suggested,
justice
stevens,
that
that
issue
might
be
critical
to
your
determination
as
far
as,
although
this
looks
like
an
absolute
title
situation,
under
old
common
law
mortgages
under
the
absolute
deed
types
of
cases,
which
were
taken
solely
for
security
purposes,
were
given
some
effect.
and
all
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
justice
stevens,
is
that
when
you
look
at
article
9
and
what
is
required
for
purposes
of
creating
a
security
interest,
and
based
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
philko
aviation
would
not
take
a
security
interest.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
that's
correct.
those
are
the
four
factors
that
this
court
should
consider
with
respect
to
its
interpretation
of
a
federal
statute,
1403.
this
court
is
called
upon
to
interpret
this
statute
as
not
only
preempting
state
law
with
respect
to
recording
statutes,
but
also
the
substantive
legal
rights.
this
court
is
being
called
upon
to
interpret
this
statute
in
such
a
way
as
to
strip
my
client
of
his
rights
in
his
new
aircraft,
those
rights
which
would
be
recognized
and
upheld
in
virtually
every
single
state
of
the
union.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting,
justice
rehnquist,
that
both
parties
do
not
have
equities.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
i
am
suggesting
the
fact
is,
is
that
under
this
particular
factual
situation
the
equities
lie
with
my
client,
because
i
do
not
believe
congress
intended
1403
to
preempt
state
law
substantive
title
questions.
i
will
agree
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
state
recording
laws,
and
that
i
would
agree.
but
with
respect
to
state
substantive
title
questions,
i
would
disagree.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
and
it
is
our
position
that
section
503
preempts
only
state
recording
laws
and
does
not
affect
the
substantive
ownership
of
title
interests.
the
mere
fact
of
recording
does
not
legitimize
an
invalid
conveyance
or
a
purported
ownership
interest,
and
there
is
no
question
that
under
state
law
philko
did
not
have
a
legitimate
interest.
philko
claims
to
have
a
superior
right
in
this
aircraft
by
virtue
of
recording
of
a
bill
of
sale.
yet,
under
state
law
it
has
no
interest
to
record
because
smith,
roger
smith,
had
no
interest
to
convey
and
having
already
sold
the
aircraft
to
a
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value
and
a
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course.
the
language
of
the
statute
clearly
preempts
state
recording
statutes,
but
it
does
not,
as
petitioner
suggests,
go
further
and
preempt
state
law
as
to
the
ownership
interest
and
priorities.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
no,
it's
not,
justice
rehnquist.
i
do
not
believe
that
my...
my
client's
rights
are
not
based
upon
this
recording
statute.
the
recording
statute
that
state
law
has
recognizes,
at
least
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
recognizes
that
interests,
especially
in
the
secured
party
situation,
that
a
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
will
take
priority
over
a
secured
creditor
if
he
takes
from
a
merchant.
even
if
the
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
checks
with
the
secretary,
in
our
state,
the
secretary
of
state's
office
and
determines
that
there's
a
financing
instrument
and
has
knowledge
of
that
financing
instrument,
that
buyer
in
the
ordinary
course
takes
priority,
at
least
under
our
state
law
and
under
our
recording
statutes,
the
statute
with
respect
to--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--that's
right.
the
faa
is
nothing
more
than
a
national
county
recorder.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
that
is
our
position,
your
honor,
and
the
first...
in
order
for
us
to
determine
that
intent,
the
first
thing
we
look
at
is
the
statute
itself,
and--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--well,
i
can
only
refer
this,
justice
white,
i
can
only
refer
this
court
to
the
decision--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--no,
i'm
just
saying--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--as
it
relates
to
title,
that's
correct.
in
fact,
justice
wisdom
in
the
gary
aircraft
versus
general
dynamics
case
says
that
the
literal
interpretation
would
lead
to
a
ridiculous
result
and
could
create
unenforceable
interests
without
giving
value,
simply
by
recording.
for
example,
if,
rather
than
giving
fair
consideration,
there
was
no
consideration
and
that
the
bill
of
sale
between
philko,
philko
aviation
and
roger
smith
was
properly
executed
under
an
illinois
law,
but
there
was
no
consideration,
and
if
it
was
filed
with
the
county
recorder,
under
the
petitioner's
interpretation
that
would
have
validity.
if
for
example...
and
i'm
not
saying
this
is
the
case,
but
it
does
demonstrate
a
ridiculous
result
under
the
petitioner's
interpretation...
if
you
had
a
three
year
old
child
that
executed
a
bill
of
sale
for
an
aircraft
and
that
bill
of
sale
was
recorded,
he
under
state
law
could
disaffirm
that
contract,
even
assuming
it
was
properly
recorded.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
let
me
tell
you
that
that
also
could
deal
with
a
ridiculous
result.
in
the
record
in
this
case,
my
client
took
possession,
justice
stevens,
on
april
19th.
mr.
mcardle
and
mr.
smith
had
their
deal
on
april...
the
following
day.
it's
unclear
as
to
when
the
bank
checked
it,
but
it
certainly
checked,
the
bank,
checked
title
with
the
faa
prior
to
the
disbursement
of
the
funds,
which
occurred
on
april
22nd.
the
testimony
of
kenneth
rittenhouse,
who
is
the
president
of
clark
aviation,
points
out
the
problems
in
dealing
with
this
recording
statute
on
a
new
aircraft.
he
states
in
his
testimony
that
he
would
not
check
the
recording
statute
because
there
would
not
be
any
interest
in
conveyance,
because
of
the
fact
that
when
a
new
aircraft
is
manufactured
and
ready
to
be
delivered
it
is
picked
up
from
the
manufacturer,
which
in
this
case
it
would
be,
and
physically
delivered
to
the
ultimate
customer.
it's
not
like
an
automobile,
that
sits
on
the
lot
of
an
automobile
dealer.
in
this
particular
case,
if
my
client
took
the
photocopies,
as
mr.
bishop
suggests,
took
the
aircraft
registration
application,
attached
all
those
documents,
and
the
day
after
he
took
delivery
put
them
in
an
envelope
and
mailed
them
to
the
faa
at
oklahoma
city,
and
assuming,
rather
than
waiting
30
days
later,
that
on
the
time
they
disbursed,
the
sandwich
state
bank
disbursed
the
funds
in
this
matter,
they
also
did
the
same
thing,
the
problem
you
have
here
is,
whichever
set
of
documents
gets
recorded
first
is
pure
happenstance.
and
why?
well,
mr.
andrews,
when
asked
why
he
waited
30
days
to
record
the
bill
of
sale,
it
is
because
of
the
fact
that
it
takes
time
in
which
to
record.
with
respect
to
mr.
rittenhouse,
the
reason
why
he
doesn't
check
the
bills
of
sale
is
because
it
takes
time.
and
he
estimates
five
or
six
days
before...
from
the
time
you
deposit
it
in
an
envelope
until
it
gets
filed,
not
recorded
but
filed,
with
the
faa.
so
what
we
are
faced
with
is
a
situation
that,
if
it
hits
the
proper
desk--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
no,
that's--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--my
client
under
the--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--no.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
no,
that's
wrong,
justice
stevens.
if
you
look
at
the
deposition
of
my
client
maurice
shacket,
he
attempted--
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
--the
reason
why
he
didn't
record
is
the
faa
refused
to
record
it.
so
you're
never
going
to
get
to
the
situation
your
honor
suggests,
where
we
have
two
sets
of
bills
of
sale
in
which
roger
smith
has
given
a
bill
of
sale
to
philko
aviation
and
roger
smith
has
given
a
bill
of
sale
to
my
client,
because
whichever
set
of
bill
of
sale
hits
the
clerk's
desk
and
gets
stamped
first,
they're
going
to
take
the
second
set
and
turn
it
back
and
say,
get
us
a
bill
of
sale
in
this
situation
from
philko
aviation.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
so
you're
never
going
to
get
the
situation
your
honor
suggests
of
having
two
bills
of
sale
from
the
same
seller
recorded
with
the
faa
at
the
same
time.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
no.
just
there
is
under
the
regulations
that
would
permit
you
to
file
with
the
faa
some
of
the
photocopies.
they
do
have
a
system
or
a
mechanism
where
title
is
in
dispute
to
determine.
like
for
court
decisions
or
anything
like
that,
you
just
have
to
file
some
sort
of
notice,
and
that
would
be
contained
in
the
section
14
cfr
14.17,
which
is
that
section
that
deals
not
only
with
recording
but
with
aircraft
registration.
i
would
direct
the
court
to
the
well-reasoned...
well
i
think
well-reasoned
since
it's
in
my
favor...
justice
wisdom's
opinion
in
gary
aircraft,
in
which
he
deals
with
the
language
"shall
be
valid"
would
lead
to
ridiculous
results.
wisdom
suggests,
as
do
the
respondents,
that
the
statute
gives
validity
if
the
instrument
that's
recorded
is
otherwise
valid.
philko's
interest
was
not
valid.
mere
recordation
could
not
transform
it
into
a
valid
instrument.
shacket's
nonrecording
against
philko
is
not
fatal
to
shacket's
superior
rights
under
controlling
state
law.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
supplant
state
substantive
law
relating
to
titles
to
aircraft.
it
merely
intended
to
be
a
simple...
simply
a
central
repository.
and
in
order
to
determine
a
legislative
intent,
because
there
really
is...
and
petitioner
and
i
both
agree...
there
is
a
total
absence
of
legislative
history.
and
i
have
attempted
to
try
to
locate
the
hearings,
and
it's
been
very
difficult,
in
order
to
find
out
what
this
is.
i
can
tell
you
that
senator
patrick
mccarran,
senator
from
nevada,
from
1935
had
submitted
various
bills.
then
senator
truman,
who
was...
this
bill,
which
ended
up
the
civil
aeronautics
act
of
1938,
was
the
floor
manager
for
this
bill.
and
if
you
look
at
the
drafts
of
the
various
senate
and
house
bills
dating
back
to
1936,
you
will
not
find
any
language
of
1403
or
comparable
language
of
1403.
it
was
only
in
the
last
bill,
that
was
eventually
passed
by
congress.
so
because
there
seems
to
be
an
absence
of
legislative
history,
we
must
look
at
comparable
statutes
that
were
in
existence
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
and
that
statute
is
the
ship
mortgage
act
of
1930.
that
statute
has
a
very
similar
recording
provision
as
1403.
yet
congress
in
the
ship
mortgage
act
defines
various
types
of
interests.
for
example,
it
defines
what
is
to
be
construed
under
the
statute
as
a
preferred
mortgage.
it
then
sets
forth
in
very
specific
detail
as
to
what
needs
to
be
contained
in
a
preferred
mortgage,
and
then
it
sets
out
priority
rules
with
respect
to
such
preferred
mortgage.
this
statute
was
in
existence
at
the
time
congress
enacted
the
civil
aeronautics
act.
as
an
aid
for
interpretation
you
look
at
the
whole
statute.
you
do
not
look
and
focus
your
attention
on
just
one
provision.
one
provision
that
was
in
existence
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
was
section
501(f).
now,
section
501(f)
deals
with
registration.
but
in
order
to
register
an
aircraft
under
the
faa,
you
must
attach
ownership
interests,
basically
the
bills
of
sale.
and
yet,
under
501
they
say,
if
you
register
an
aircraft
it
is
not
presumed
or
is
not
a
decision
as
to
who
has
title.
and
then
we
look,
in
1964
we
look
at
section
1406.
and
they
talk
about
the
validity
of
any
instrument
the
recording
of
which
shall
be
governed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
such
instrument
is
delivered.
it
is
clear,
justice
stevens,
that
this
is
merely
a
choice
of
law
forum,
as
to
what
law
to
apply.
petitioner
would
have
this
court
and
suggests
to
this
court
that
all
that
provision
did
is
we
look
to
the
mechanics
of
execution
of
the
documents.
but
the
legislative
history,
which
is
not
clear...
i'm
not
suggesting
it
is...
but
it
seems
to
indicate,
because
i
have
quoted
a
portion
of
it
in
my
brief
from
the
hearings
and
they
quoted
another
section
of
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
when
you
read
the
senate
reports,
where
they
look
to
the
senate
report
to
determine
the
validity
of
such
instrument,
one
would
need
only
look
to
the
substantive
law
of
the
particular
place
in
which
the
relevant
instrument
is
delivered.
now,
it
doesn't
define
substantive
law
there,
but
my
understanding
of
it
and
i
think
any
reasonable
person's
understand
is
substantive
law
is
the
substantive
law
as
far
as,
if
that
instrument
would
convey
an
interest
in
property
you
look
to
that
state's
law.
if
it
would
not,
then
that
instrument,
the
fact
that
it's
recorded
has
no
validity.
and
vis
a
vis
my
client,
that's
correct.
they
don't
have
title,
and
the
fact
of
their
recording
does
not
vest
title
in
philko
aviation.
then
we
look
at
the
interpretation...
and
in
addition,
with
respect...
with
respect
to
this
particular
interpretation,
the...
it
is
of
particular
note
that
the
letter
from
the
then
current
administrator
of
the
faa
to
senator
warren
magnusen
relating
to
section
1406,
and
that
letter
is
part
of
the
senate
report,
which
states
in
pertinent
part:
"as
in
the
case
with
the
recording
system,
substantive
validity
of
recorded
instruments
remains
a
question
of
local
law.
"
then
we
look
at
the
current
regulations
of
the
faa.
now,
obviously...
and
i
am
not
attempting
to
suggest
that
this
court
is
bound
to
take
into
consideration
the
regulations
of
the
faa
when
in
this
court's
opinion
that
it
believes
directly
contravenes
the
statute.
however,
i
do
suggest
to
you,
and
this
court
has
held,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
you
give
great
weight
to
the
interpretations
of
agencies
that
have
been
vested
by
congress
for
the
implementation
of
a
statute.
and
under
14
cfr
section
4917
of
that
statute,
it
states:
"the
recording
of
a
conveyance
is
not
a
decision
of
the
faa
that
the
instrument
does
in
fact
affect
title
to
or
an
interest
in
the
aircraft
or
other
property
it
covers.
"
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
isn't.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
recording,
at
least
as
far
as
the
faa's
position,
is
that
it's
not
going
to
make
a
title
question,
render
a
decision
as
to
who
has
title
to
an
aircraft,
if
the
instrument
is
just
merely
recorded
with
it.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
other
than
the
fact
of...
you
mean
talking
about
the
notarization
provision?
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
thank
you.
well,
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
yes,
i
would,
justice
o'connor.
my
analysis
of
that
statute
is
that
all
that...
or
that
treaty,
the
mortgage
convention
act...
and
all
i
can
give
you,
justice
o'connor,
is
my
reading
of
the
mortgage
convention
act...
under
article
1,
paragraph
2,
makes
clear
that
each
contracting
state's
substantive
law
will
control
rights
in
an
aircraft.
there
is
no
need
to
adopt
a
uniform
national
law.
article
17
of
the
mortgage
convention
permits
contract
states
to
reference
the
law
of
territories.
and
i
must
admit,
my
interpretation
of
the
law
of
territories
would
be
analogous
to
the
law
of
the
states.
third
party
rights
in
the
aircraft
are
determined
according
to
the
law
of
the
contracting
state.
in
addition,
under
section...
when
section
506
or
1406
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1964,
the
state
department
sent
a
letter
to
the
senate,
and
they
had
the
reports
and
they
read
it,
and
they
said
that
they
had
no
objection
to
1406.
and
i
have
to
submit
and
i
think
we
have
to
agree
that
in
my
opinion
it
does
affect
substantive
title
law.
i
would
just
like
to
make
mention
of
the
following
facts.
the
state's
law
concept
of
possession
as
a
factor
in
determining
substantive
ownership
interest
does
not
violate
any
federal
interest.
the
question
that
somehow
lenders
are
going
to
be
disabused
for
investing
in
an
airplane
if
you
don't
have
a
central
recording
is
just
simply
nonsense.
we
do
not
have
a
central
recording
system
for
heavy
equipment,
heavy
construction
equipment.
there
is
no
central
recording,
and
yet
lenders
on
a
day-in
and
day-out
basis
lend
on
that
kind
of
equipment
and
file
their
interests
with
the
state
law.
and
that
type
of
heavy
construction
equipment
is
as
expensive,
if
not
more
so,
than
this
particular
aircraft
which
we
are
dealing
with.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
i'm
not
arguing
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
i
am
not
suggesting,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
this
is
not
a
central
recording
statute.
all
i'm
suggesting
is,
to
respond
to
mr.
bishop's
argument
that
somehow
lenders
will
be
wary
about
lending
on
aircraft
if
you
do
not
interpret
this
statute
as
affecting
substantive
priorities.
that's
all
my
comments
went
to.
the
registration
provision
of
section
501
effectively
controls
aircraft
in
this
country.
title
14
cfr
1431
talks
about
aircraft,
application
for
aircraft
registration.
you
get
an
n
number.
the
n
number
is
like
a
license
number.
it's
the
registration
number
of
the
aircraft
and
they
control
everything
through
that
n
number.
with
respect
to
the
mobility,
if
there's
any
federal
law
or
agency
that
controls
transportation
more
than
the
faa
i
don't
know
what
agency
there
is.
they
basically
control
from
the
time
it
leaves
the
airport
gate
to
the
time
it
arrives
at
its
destination.
it
controls
the
manufacturing,
the
specification.
it
oversees
continual
repair
of
all
this
equipment.
and
it's
all
keyed
to
the
registration
number,
not
the
recording
statute.
there
is
no
reason
that
has
been
advanced
by
these
petitioners
to
reject
well-established
and
non-discriminatory
state
law,
and
that
this
court
should
end
up
with
a
situation
and
adopt
this
statute,
which
is
not
clear
and
congressional
intent
is
not
clear,
and
that
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
it,
and
to
in
effect
interpret
it
in
such
a
way
that
in
effect
in
this
situation
if,
rather
than
taking
the
bills
of
sale,
my
client
left
the
aircraft
and
roger
smith
forged
the
bill
of
sale.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
smith.
mr.
james
c.
murray,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
mean,
and
my
client
did
have
a
bill
of
sale.
thank
you,
justice
stevens.
thank
you,
your
honor--
