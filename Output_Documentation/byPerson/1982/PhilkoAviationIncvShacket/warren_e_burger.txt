we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
philko
aviation,
incorporated,
against
shacket.
mr.
bishop,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
repeating
all
these
facts
to
demonstrate
or
persuade
us
that
we're
confronted
with
two
bona
fide
purchasers
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
your
client
made
the
purchase,
did
he...
where
was
the
airplane?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
instead
of
a
conflict
between
two
purchasers
in
good
faith,
at
the
time
your
client
made
the
purchase,
consummated
the
transaction,
the
airplane
was
in
the
custody
of
some
repair
organization
and
had
a
claim
for
$50,000
for
repair
and
maintenance.
now,
is
there
a
provision
for
recording
mechanic's
liens
under
this
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
was
in
the
possession
of
the
company
making
alterations
and
the
alterations
had
not
been
completed,
there
wouldn't
be
any
occasion
to
record.
they
might
not
know
the
total
amount.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
claim.
now,
wouldn't
your
client
take
subject
to
whatever
that
claim
was?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
federal
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
what
does
the
repairman
have
to
do,
file
his
lien
before
he
starts
his
work?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
your
client
have
no
obligation
to
find
out
where
this
aircraft
was
and
whether
someone
in
possession
might
have
a
mechanic's
lien
claim,
as
yet
unrecorded
because
as
yet
unknown?
chief
justice
warren

justice

but
here,
mr.
