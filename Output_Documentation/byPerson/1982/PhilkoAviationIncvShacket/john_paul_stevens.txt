justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bishop,
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
because
of
1406
that
the
validity
of
the
instruments
describing
the
second
transaction,
which
were
in
fact
recorded,
are
governed
by
illinois
law
because
of
1406?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
a
slight
overstatement,
isn't
it,
mr.
bishop?
isn't
it
valid
as
to
the
parties
to
the
transaction
and
all
persons
who
have
actual
notice
of
the
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it's
not
recorded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
it
should
develop
that
the
relationship
between
your
client
and
the
fraudulent
dealer
was
such
that
your
client
should
be
deemed
to
have
been
on
actual
notice,
then
you
would
be
bound?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
follow
up,
mr.
bishop,
on
what
justice
o'connor
was
asking
you
about.
would
you
not
agree
that
if
there
had
been
two
recorded
documents,
one
by
each
purchaser,
that
state
law
then
would
govern
the
priority
as
between
the
two?
isn't
that
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
least
if
they
were
both
security
interest
documents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
if
there
had
been
two
recorded
documents.
1403
really
just
deals
with
the
kind
of
document
that
has
never
been
recorded,
and
i'm
just
asking
you
about,
had
there
been
two
recorded
documents.
then
it
seems
to
me
you
would
be
in
a
state
law
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
murray,
is
it
not
possible
that,
even
though
the
second
purchaser
wasn't
a
purchaser
under
illinois
law,
that
either
he
or
the
bank
had
a
security
interest
in
the
claim?
there's
been
no
ruling
on
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
it
hasn't
yet
been
decided
don't
we
have
to,
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
federal
statute,
at
least
consider
that
one
possibility
is
that
the
second
purchaser
did
acquire
a
security
interest
in
the
plane?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you'd
have
to
decide
whether
such
a
security
interest
would
be
valid
as
against
a
prior
unrecorded
transaction,
assuming
that
the
security
interest
person
did
not
have
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
may
be
entirely
right,
but
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
has
not
yet
been
decided
whether
the
second
purchaser
got
a
security
interest,
because
the
district
court
didn't
really
address
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
assume
that
possibility
in
order
to
resolve
the
proper
construction
of
the
federal
statute,
that
it
is
at
least
possible
that
on
remand,
because
we
have
a
summary
judgment
situation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
a
trial
would
show
there
was
a
security
interest.
and
then
the
question
is,
would
the
federal
statute
protect
that
security
interest
against
a
prior
unrecorded
sale
of
the
aircraft?
justice
john
paul
stevens
normally
we
don't
decide
questions
of
state
law,
is
all
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
even
if
that's
true,
what
that
means
is
that
even
if
you
lose
the
battle
here
you
may
win
the
war.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
murray,
i
really
don't
think
that's
correct,
because
you're
arguing
about
the
fact
that
state
law
controls
the
meaning
and
validity
of
recorded
instruments.
but
1403(c)
doesn't
deal
with
recorded
instruments;
it
deals
with
the
failure
to
record.
it
says
if
you
fail
to
record
then
that
shall
not
be
a
valid
transaction.
and
here
we're
dealing
with
a
situation,
unlike
the
gary
case,
in
which
there
was
a
failure
to
record.
and
why
doesn't
the
plain
language
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
might
have
the
second
set
of
papers
filed
first,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
would
not
be
within
1403(c)
because
then
there
would
not
be
a
failure
to
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you'd
have
both
transactions
recorded--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
your
question
arguably
would
be
resolved
under
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
here
you
have
one
set
of
papers
that
were
simply
not
recorded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
he
did
not
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
because
of
the
faa's
practice
of
only
accepting
the
original.
then
the
statute
provides
a
mechanism
that
will
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
murray,
let
me
ask
you
just
one
question
of
fact,
if
i
may.
under
your
view,
from
whom
did
shacket
get
title,
from
smith
or
from
clark?
justice
john
paul
stevens
from
smith.
was
smith
in
title,
then,
for
at
least
a
moment?
is
that
the
theory,
it
went
from
clark
to
smith?
