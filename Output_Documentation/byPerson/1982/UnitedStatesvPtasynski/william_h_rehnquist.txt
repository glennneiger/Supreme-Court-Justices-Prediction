justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
color
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wallace,
is
it
your
submission
that
the
uniformity
clause
would
have
no
application
if
one
could
show
that
somehow
there
was
no
discrimination
against
a
minority
of
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
make
the
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
uniformity
clause?
i
can
see
how
you
might
have
an
argument
about
the
severability
clause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
that
they
have
very
long
winters
in
alaska
and
very
short
days.
of
course,
that
wouldn't
be
true
in
louisiana,
would
it?
that's
certainly
a
difference.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
tax
is
actually
on
oil
production,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is...
what
is
the
task
on?
that
is
what
i
was
asking.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
were
co-extensive
in
the
sense
that
only
the
state
of
alaska
was
embraced
within
the
exemption.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
outside
the
state
of
alaska?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
williams,
do
those
observations
suggest
that
we
shouldn't
in
this
case,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
the
substantive
law
issue,
follow
the
practice
that
we
generally
have
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
congress
would
have
intended
had--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
judicial
imposition
of
taxes
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
impose
any
worse
than
judicial
relief
from
taxes
elsewhere
that
congress
did
intend
to
impose?
