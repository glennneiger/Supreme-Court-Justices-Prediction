justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
suppose...
what
do
you
suppose
this
exemption...
why
did
it
even
come
into
being,
or
do
you
know,
or
do
you
care?
it
seems...
it
certainly
couldn't
be
because
alaska
outlobbied
all
the
rest
of
the
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
some
powerful
senators
from
that
state,
that's
true,
but
they
only
have
two
votes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what...
so
i'll
ask
my
question
again.
what
did
prompt
congress
to
do
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
they
were
just...
you
say
they
were
just
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
they
were
right,
absolutely
right.
you'd
still
be
here
making
this
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
the
exemption
would
be
invalid
if
they
exempted
all
oil
produced
above
the
arctic
circle,
and
it
turned
out
that
the
only
oil
produced
was
offshore
on
the
continental
shelf?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
by
depth
of
oil...
oil
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
might--
justice
byron
r.
white
--raise
their
costs
to
what
others...
that
your
message
is
that
they
were
a
lower
cost
producer
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
add--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
if
you
add
the
tax,
it
may
not
hurt
them
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
the
amount
of
the
tax--
