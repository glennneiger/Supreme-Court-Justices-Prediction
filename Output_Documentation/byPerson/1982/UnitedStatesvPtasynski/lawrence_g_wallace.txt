mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
this
tax
refund
suit,
the
district
court
held
the
crude
oil
windfall
profits
tax
act
of
1980
unconstitutional
and
ordered
refunds
for
taxable
periods
in
the
year
1980.
the
district
court
held,
contrary
to
our
contention,
that
the
act
violates
the
uniformity
clause
of
article
i,
section
8
of
the
constitution,
and
rejected
our
further
contentions
that
no
refund
should
be
available
in
any
event
in
this
suit
because
there
was
no
oil
extracted
in
1980
that
was
subject
to
the
exemption
at
issue,
and
our
contentions
regarding
severability
of
the
exemption
at
issue.
the
district
court
stayed
its
judgment,
and
the
united
states
appealed
to
this
court.
the
act
at
issue
was
the
product
of
many
months,
almost
a
year,
of
congressional
study
and
deliberations
involving
extensive
hearings,
staff
studies,
committee
reports,
floor
debate,
amendments,
et
cetera.
it
was
enacted
in
conjunction
with
the
phaseout
of
domestic
oil
price
controls.
the
decontrol
of
domestic
oil
prices
was
undertaken
to
achieve
two
purposes.
one
was
to
alleviate
market
disparities,
distortions
that
had
existed
because
of
market
disparities
between
the
controlled
domestic
oil
prices
and
the
rising
world
prices
subject
to
manipulation
by
the
opec
cartel.
and
the
second
purpose
was
to
encourage
domestic
exploration
and
development
to
make
the
united
states
less
dependent
on
imported
oil.
and
it
was
recognized
widely
in
congress
as
a
quid
pro
quo
for
the
price
increases
that
would
be
caused
by
decontrol
this
act
was
required
if
president
carter
was
going
to
go
through
with
decontrol.
actually,
the
phaseout
was
completed
by
president
reagan.
but
we
have
cited
in
note
10
of
page
14
of
our
reply
brief
a
number
of
statements
made
on
the
floor
by
various
members
of
congress
explicitly
recognizing
that
this
was
a
part
of
the
decontrol
program
in
the
sense
that
the
windfall
tax
was
a
quid
pro
quo
for
decontrol.
now,
the
structure
of
the
act
is
summarized
in
chart
form
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
we
filed
on
page
3a,
which
is
part
of
the
district
court's
opinion.
the
principal
provisions
of
title
i
of
the
act,
which
is
the
title
that
imposes
the
tax,
are
set
forth
there
in
chart
form.
and
our
contention
is
that
except
for
the
first
categories
of
exceptions,
which
are
not
at
issue
here
and
which
were
designed
for
other
purposes
because
the
revenues
there
were
thought
to
be
devoted
to
public
purposes
extraneous
to
the
overall
purposes
of
this
act,
the
other
provisions
of
the
act,
including
the
so-called
provision
for
exempt
alaskan
oil,
all
fit
into
a
unified
theme.
the
act
was
intricately
designed
to
tax
what
congress
said
was
the
subject
of
the
tax,
the
windfall
profits
that
would
result
from
the
decontrol
of
domestic
oil
prices.
but
those
windfall
profits
were
to
be
identified
through
various
mechanisms
in
the
act
in
a
way
that
did
not
tax
all
of
the
decontrol
revenues
that
would
ensue,
but
only
those
that
would
be
over
and
above
the
ones
that
served
the
purposes
of
decontrol,
including
the
purpose
to
encourage
domestic
exploration
and
development
of
oil
that
might
otherwise
not
occur.
it
was
sometimes
put
that
way
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history,
and
sometimes
stated
as
a
corollary,
that
the
act
was
designed
to
impose
relatively
high
tax
rates
where
production
cannot
be
expected
to
respond
very
much
to
further
increases
in
price
and
relatively
low
tax
rates
on
oil
whose
production
is
likely
to
be
responsive
to
price.
in
other
words,
the
windfall
that
congress
was
seeking
to
identify
was
that
portion
of
the
decontrol
revenues
that
were
not
needed
for
one
of
the
purposes
of
decontrol,
which
was
to
stimulate
domestic
production.
and
the
mechanisms
used
included
differences
in
the
rate
base
and
these
various
tiers
of
taxable
rates,
all
intricately
adjusted
so
as
to
identify
what
congress
was
getting
at,
what
it
considered
to
be
the
windfall.
and
as
might
be
expected,
the
highest
rate
of
tax
would
be
on
the
so-called
old
oil,
the
existing
oil
production
that
obviously
would
not
have
been
stimulated
by
the
decontrol.
the
windfall
was
only
being
taxed
at
these
various
rates.
it
wasn't
being
entirely
eliminated.
and
other
adjustments
reflect
various
details
such
as
the
fact
that
heavy
oil
is
more
expensive
to
extract
and
produce.
there
were
special
adjustments
made
for
independent
producers
as
against
vertically
integrated
producers
because
they
did
not
have
what
was
referred
to
as
downstream
revenues
and
needed
more
in
the
way
of
return
to
encourage
their
further
explorations.
these
various
factors
were
considered
in
great
detail
and
painstakingly
adjusted
for
insofar
as
it
was
practicable
to
do
so
in
this
rather
elaborate
statute.
and
the
exemption
for
so-called
exempt
alaskan
oil
fits
into
this
same
pattern.
this
was
carefully
drawn
to
identify
those
sources
of
oil
in...
because
of
extreme
climatic
and
other
conditions
where
no
windfall
was
expected
to
accrue
at
all
within
the
meaning
of
what
congress
was
getting
at.
now,
this
can
be
understood
with
reference
to
a
map
which
is
appended
to
the
brief
in
our
support,
the
amicus
curiae
brief
of
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
a
green
brief,
mr.
justice.
there's
no
difference
in
the
color
code
between
amicus
briefs
in
our
support
and
amicus
briefs
in
support
of
the
appellees.
but
it
is
a
green
brief
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
alaska.
it
has
a
foldout
map
at
the
back
which
indicates
the
scope
of
the
exempt
alaskan
oil.
and
this
particular
exemption,
i
might
say
at
the
outset,
is
a
rather
strange
subject
for
a
holding
of
invalidity
under
the
uniformity
clause,
which
was,
in
its
historical
origins,
designed
to
prevent
combinations
of
states
from
discriminating
in
an
oppressive
way
against
minorities
of
states.
what's
involved
here
is
an
exemption
from
the
tax
for
a
small
percentage
of
oil
partially
located
in
one
state,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
not
our
submission,
but
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--because
it...
it...
it
puts
in
perspective
what
it
is
that
we're
dealing
with
here
and
why
we
believe
that
congress
acted
consistently
with
respect
to
this
oil
production
in
keeping
with
the
theme
of
the
act
as
a
whole,
rather
than
in
a
way
that
should
raise
concerns
under
the
uniformity
clause.
now,
the...
the
exemption
specifically
excludes
from
the
exempt
coverage
the
oil
being
produced
in
the
sadlerochit
reservoir,
which
is
pictured
at
the
very
top.
that
is
the
largest
oil
reservoir
in
alaska,
at
least
of
discovered
reservoirs,
and
it
is
currently
producing
more
oil
than
is
produced
in
any
other
state
other
than
texas
as
a
whole.
that
one
reservoir
is
currently
producing
more
oil
than
any
other
state
as
a
whole.
the
exemption
also
excludes
the
cook
inlet
oil
and
other
oil
that's
been
developed
down
in
the
area
closer
to
anchorage.
the
dotted
line,
which
identifies
the
beginning
of
the
north
slope
of
the
alaska
range
and
aleutian
range
is
the
dividing
line
for
the
exemption,
but
the
exemption
excludes
any
oil
within
75
miles
of
the
trans-atlanta
pipe...
the
trans-alaska
pipeline
system
until
it
reaches
the
arctic
circle,
and
then
the
oil
is
included
except
for
the
sadlerochit
reservoir.
now,
the
state
of
alaska
informs
us
in
its
amicus
brief
on
pages
5
and
7
that
currently
approximately
5
percent
of
the
oil
being
produced
in
alaska
is
subject
to
the
exemption.
it
is
estimated
that
during
the
latter
years
of
the
applicability
of
the
windfall
profits
tax,
which
has
a
phaseout
provision,
that
percentage
may
rise
to
about
10
or
perhaps
a
little
more
than
10
percent,
although
much
of
the
expected
additional
production
would
be
in
outer
continental
shelf
wells
which
are
not
part
of
the
state
of
alaska
at
all.
so
that
we're
talking,
since
there
was
no
production
there
for
more
than
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
act
took
effect
at
all,
no
exempt
oil
being
produced,
we're
talking
about
what
can
on
the
average
not
be
expected
to
be
more
than
10
percent
of
alaskan
production
during
the
entire
period
of
the
act.
and
this,
in
terms
of
the
revenue
disparity
caused
by
the
exemption,
would
be
further
discounted
because
the
sadlerochit
oil
and
virtually
all
other
alaskan
oil,
the
great
bulk
of
the
90
percent,
is
subject
to
the
highest
rate
of
the
tax
under
the
statute,
70
percent,
whereas
the
exempt
oil
would
be
subject
to
the
rate
for
newly
discovered
oil,
which
at
the
time
of
the
initial
enactment
was
30
percent,
and
in
a
1981
amendment
is
being
phased
down
from
30
to
15
percent
on
newly
discovered
oil
throughout
the
united
states.
so
that
we're
talking
in
terms
of
the
effect
of
the
exemption
in
alaska
of
a
very
small
proportion
of
the
revenues
that
would
otherwise
be
generated
from
alaska
by
this
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
does
bear
on
the
severability
clause,
but
it
also
bears
on
the
contention
being
made
by
the
appellees
that
this
act
favors
alaska
as
a
price
for
getting
political
support
from
alaskan
representatives
in
congress,
and
represents
a
coalition
of
alaska
with
others
who
favored
the
act
as
against
the
states
that
would
be
more
heavily
taxed.
actually,
alaska
is
one
of
the
most
heavily
taxed
states,
and
every
member
of
the
alaska
delegation
who
voted
voted
against
the
act.
but
it
bears
on
what
is
argued
to
be
the
legislative
background
of
the
act
and
the
way
it...
it...
an
effort
has
been
made
to
fit
it
into
the
historical
purposes
of
the
uniformity
clause
as
showing
an
unfair
coalition
of
states
acting
against
the
interests
of
other
states.
and
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that...
that...
we
think
that...
that
what
is
reflected
here
is
a
finding
of
a
unique
combination
of
risks
and
costs
in
this
area
due
to
the
climate,
the
geological
factors,
the...
the
special
problems
of
the
fragile
environment
caused
by
permafrost.
many...
these
things
are
described
in
some
detail
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae
of
the
state
of
alaska.
but
what
they
show
is
that
because
of
the
dangers
of
local
flooding
if
the
permafrost
is
disturbed
during
the
warm
weather...
and
all
of
this
was
brought
out
in
hearings
before
congress...
the
necessity
is
in
these
areas
to
operate
during
the
winter
months
when
the
climate
is
very
severe
and
when
there
is
a
great
deal
of
darkness,
in
some
areas
no
light
for
many
weeks
at
a
time;
they're
very
remote
from
transportation,
from
sources
of
labor,
sources
of
supply,
so
that
supply
and
labor
costs
are
many
times
what
they
are
elsewhere
in
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
no
showing
has
been
made
either
before
congress
or
in
the
district
court
that
that
is
true.
and
congress
based
its
judgment
on
what
it
concluded
to
be
unique
problems
in
alaska
that
eliminated
the
possibility
of
any
windfall
occurring
there
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
of
course
it's
a
difference.
and
the...
the
problems
of
equipment
being
subjected
to
the
severe
weather
problems,
the
need
for
delays
in
the
severe
weather
when
no
work
can
be
done
at
all,
which
requires
very
highly
paid
crews
to
stand
by
idly
and
to
be
housed
and
fed
in
these
remote
areas,
these...
these
problems
were
detailed
in
the
legislative
history.
and
the
exemption
really
was
put
in
in
response
to
the
suggestion
made
during
the
hearings
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
which
reflected
that
the
exemption
really
served
the
same
purposes
and
reflected
the
same
standards
as
the
other
mechanisms
in
the
act
used
to
identify
the
windfall
profit.
and
we
quoted
this
testimony
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
early
on
in
the
hearing
process
that
there
are
no
windfalls
that
will
be
gained
by
the
producers
of
the
alaskan
crudes,
confining
the
remarks
to
the
exempt
area.
and
he
went
on
to
say
it
is
easier
to
exempt
alaskan
production
from
the
tax
than
to
require
alaskan
producers
to
file
tax
returns
solely
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
no
liability
has
been
incurred,
because
this
is
an
expensive
tax
to
administer.
and
the
exemption,
in
keeping
with
the
overall
purposes
of
the
tax,
was
meant
to
encourage
the
development
of
these
domestic
oil
resources.
and
this
brings
us
to...
now,
so,
let
me...
before
i
get
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
point,
i
just
want
to
say
that
we
think
that
this,
because
of
the
findings
congress
made
about
the
unique
circumstances
in
alaska,
meets
the
established
standard
of
this
court's
cases
under
the
uniformity
clause:
that
the
tax
is
uniform
because
it
operates
with
the
same
force
and
effect
in
every
place
where
the
subject
of
it
is
found,
because
congress
isolated
this
area
as
one
where
windfall
profits
would
not
be
found.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is...
well,
it
is
designed
to
tax
the
windfall
profit.
that
is
what
congress
called
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
on
oil
produced
and
sold
or
for
which
sale
is
imputed.
if
it
is
stockpiled,
if
the
sales
price
exceeds
the
base
price
specified
in
the
act
for
the
particular
oil.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if,
as
i
contended
before
lunch,
the
act
treats
all
persons
similarly
situated
with
regard
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
act
in
a
similar
manner,
then
the
question
remains
whether
the
fact
that
congress
used
geographic
terms
in
describing
the
scope
of
the
exemption
in
some
way
adds
an
infirmity.
we
think
not.
we
think
the
exemption...
that
the
uniformity
clause
protects
substantive
rights
and
doesn't
prevent
congress
from
using
a
clear
and
convenient
means
of
expressing
itself,
even
though
that
means
happens
to
employ
geographic
terms.
they
were
not
co-extensive
in
this
case
with
any
political
boundaries
at
all.
and
i
think
the
point
is
best
put--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
offshore
oil
adjacent
thereto,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
in
the
bering
sea.
and
i
think
the
point
is
best
made,
if
i
may
quote
a
sentence
used
by
judge
friendly
in
the
in
re:
penn
central
transportation
company
case,
a
decision
that
was
approved
by
this
court
in
the
regional
reorganization
cases
in
419
u.s.,
the
way
he
put
it
was
that
since
what
congress
did
was
not
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
we
decline
to
hold
its
action
to
have
constituted
a
breach
of
the
uniformity
clause
there
of
the
bankruptcy
clause
simply
because
it
used
words
readily
intelligible
to
its
members
in
the
public
rather
than
circumlocutions
that
would
have
had
exactly
the
same
effect.
and
there
has
been
no
showing
that
the
effect
itself,
no
showing
either
in
congress
or
in
the
court
below
that
the
effect
itself
is
not
a
permissible
one.
now,
in
the
brief
time
remaining
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
severability.
as
in
zobel
v.
williams
last
term,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
court
need
speculate
about
what
the
congressional
intent
was.
it
is
common
ground
here
that
the
question
of
severability
is
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
and
the
congressional
intent
governs.
the
question
arose
not
in
time
to
be
included
in
the
committee
reports,
but
it
nonetheless
arose
in
the
discussion
on
the
conference
report
prior
to
the
vote
and
was
quite
authoritatively
addressed
by
the
floor
manager
of
the
bill
and
chairman
of
the
finance
committee,
senator
long
of
louisiana.
and
what
he
said
on
the
floor
is:
"mr.
president,
it
is
our
intention
that
in
the
event
the
court
should
find
this
favorable
treatment
for
alaska
dictated
by
the
very
high
production
costs
in
that
area
should
violate
the
conformity
provision
as
it
is
there,
the
uniformity
provision
in
the
constitution,
that
provision
should
be
regarded
as
a
nullity,
and
that
alaska
will
pay
the
same
30
percent
tax
on
new
oil
as
everybody
else.
"
"if
that
should
be
too
much,
congress
could
consider
it
in
the
future.
"
and
then
the
next
paragraph
is
the
one
reproduced
on
page
11
of
our
reply
brief
where
he
essentially
repeats
the
same
thing,
emphasizing
once
again
the
intention
that
it
is
the
exemption
that
would
fall
under
the
severability
clause
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
and
these
views
not
only
were
uncontradicted
on
the
floor,
but
they
were
supported
by
a
memorandum
from
the
office
of
legislative
counsel
that
senator
long
then
had
printed
by
unanimous
consent
into
the
record.
there
is
no
other
indication
of
congressional
intent
on
this
subject.
and
since
everyone
seemed
to
be
satisfied
by
the
reassurance
of
senator
long,
first
that
the
uniformity
clause
was
not
violated,
but
even
if
it
were,
it
would
not
endanger
anything
but
the
exemption
itself,
that
is
the
only
indication
of
congressional
intent
we
have
and
should
govern.
and,
indeed,
even
by
a
process
of
inductive
reasoning,
since
this
was
a
revenue
measure
reported
out
of
ways
and
means
and
senate
finance
and
one
in
which
the
conference
report
emphasized
the
amount
of
revenue
that
was
expected,
$227.7
billion
over
a
12-year
period,
and
pointed
to
other
titles
of
the
act
which
involved
tax
credits
and
aid
to
needy
families
and
the
like
as...
with
the
clear
implication
that
these
were
justified
by
the
revenue
intake.
and
the
fact
that
the
exemption
is
a
very
minor
part
of
this
overall
picture...
we're
talking
about
less
than
ten
percent,
as
i
explained,
of
the
proceeds
to
be
expected
from
one
state...
and
the
fact
that
they
pointed
to
other
possible
means
of
subsidizing
production
if
necessary,
which
of
course
would
not
be
subject
to
the
uniformity
clause,
which
applies
only
to
taxation
measures,
it's
clear
that
this,
in
context,
very
small
tail
should
not
be
wagging
the
dog
and
abrogating
this
major
revenue
measure.
and
beyond
that,
the
stopping
point,
if
any
of
the
revenue
measure
were
to
be
invalidated,
should
have
been
only
the
tax
on
newly
discovered
oil,
one
of
the
categories
being
taxed,
because
the
alaskan
exemption
applied
only
to
newly
discovered
oil,
and
this
is
a
relatively
very
small
part
of
the
revenues
produced
by
the
tax.
in
1981,
calendar
1981,
for
example,
the
first
full
year
that
the
act
was
in
effect,
of
20...
more
than
$26.5
billion
in
revenues,
less
than
$1.5
billion
were
from
newly
discovered
oil.
so
that
even
in
that
way
a
great
deal
of
the
act
and
its
revenue
production
could
have
been
saved,
which
is
the
cardinal
principle,
particularly
in
revenue
measures.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
please.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
say
that
if
you
look
at
high
production
costs--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
professor
williams
has
spent
much
of
his
time
on
the
question
of
severability,
but
our
principal
contention
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
uniformity
clause.
and
as
i
understand
his
argument
in
the
appellees'
brief,
they
concede
that
congress
could
have
achieved
precisely
the
result
it
achieved
here
if
it
had
used
different
language
in
drafting
the
exemption
provision
at
issue.
that
means
to
us
that
no
one
is
being
subjected
to
taxation
that
congress
is
prohibited
by
the
constitution
from
imposing,
or
in
other
words
that
the
uniformity...
the
protection
afforded
by
the
uniformity
clause,
which
is
substantive
protection,
is
not
being
violated
here.
there
have
been
references
to
the
cost
per
barrel
of
producing
oil
in
alaska.
of
course,
the
oil
being
produced
costs
less
per
barrel
to
produce
in
alaska
than
oil
elsewhere
because
you
have
to
add
on
such
enormous
transportation
costs.
the
only
reservoirs
being
developed,
particularly
in
these
remote
regions,
are
the
ones
where
you
can
efficiently
produce
it
because
you're
getting
a
wellhead
price
of
$8
to
$10
less
than
the
wellhead
price
that
you
can
get
elsewhere.
and
that
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
why
congress
concluded
that
the
sadlerochit
reservoir
should
be
taxed
and
taxed
at
the
highest
rate.
the
exemption
was
designed
to
nurture
production
elsewhere.
and
footnote
26
on
page
19
of
our
brief
shows
how
a
slight
decline
in
the
price
of
oil
during
1982
was
shown
to
have
resulted
in
a
slowdown
of
development
in
the
kuparuk
river
field
precisely
because
of
this
problem.
one
of
the
things
that
distinguishes
the
exempt
area
from
the
rest
of
the
united
states
is
the
extreme
remoteness
from
refineries
and
markets
that
results
in
very
substantial
transportation
costs.
and
below
the
arctic
circle
the
exempt
area
excludes
anything
within
75
miles
of
the
trans-alaska
pipeline
system.
the
exemption
is
carefully
tailored
to
isolate
those
places
where
congress
had
ample
reason
to
conclude
that
no
windfall
would
result
in
terms
of
what
they
were
trying
to
reach.
and
certainly
the
theme
that
is
as
consistent
as
the
theme
that
an
exemption
for
this
would
fit
into
the
scheme
of
the
act
is
the
theme
equally
in
every
version
of
the
bill
that
a
very
substantial
tax
would
be
imposed.
that
is
as
consistent
a
theme
as
the
exemption
theme
and
was
certainly
the
principal
purpose
of
the
act,
to
have
revenues
resulting
from
the
windfall
that
was
going
to
result
from
decontrol.
