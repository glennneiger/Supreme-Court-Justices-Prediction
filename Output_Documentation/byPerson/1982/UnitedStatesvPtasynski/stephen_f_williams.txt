mr.
stephen
f.
williams
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
uniformity
clause
of
the
constitution
requires
that
excise
taxes
be
uniform
throughout
the
united
states.
the
crude
oil
windfall
profit
tax
of
1980
imposes
an
excise
tax
on
the
production
and
removal
of
crude
oil,
and
that
tax
applies,
according
to
the
terms
of
the
statute,
in
49
states
and
one-quarter
of
alaska.
it's
depicted
i
think
very
clearly
in
the
map
attached
to
our
brief.
the
tax
quite
clearly
violates
the
terms
of
the
constitution,
and
accordingly
should
be
found
in
invalid.
i
might
say
that
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
4
suggests
that
congress
has
taxed
such
profits,
windfall
profits,
in
every
place
where
it
has
determined
them
to
exist.
you
should
understand,
your
honors,
that
the
statute
has
a
formula
for
the
computation
of
windfall
profit...
that
is
to
say,
removal
price
minus
suggested
base
price...
and
pursuant
to
that
formula,
the
oil
in
the
exempt
portions
of
alaska
would
be
taxable.
second,
following
up
a
few
points
by
mr.
wallace,
there's
nothing
deminimis
about
this
exception.
confining
ourselves
to
the
kuparuk
river
field,
which
is
already
in
production,
you're
talking
about
a
field
which,
if
it
were
a
single
state,
would
rank
seventh
among
all
oil-producing
states
in
the
united
states.
as
historically
understood,
the
uniformity
clause
has
acted
a
restraint
on
regional
preferences
and
upon
regional
jealousies.
it
has
done
so
entirely
without
any
need
for
the
court
to
get
into
questions
of
tax
policy
or
to
get
into
questions
of
legislative
motivation.
it's
been
a
clear,
bright
line,
understandable
to
all,
and
obeyable
by
all,
including
congress.
there's
no
need
after
200
years
of
a
successful
operation
of
this
clause
to
suddenly
abandon
it
in
favor
of
an
ill-described
formula
suggested
by
the
government.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
yes.
i
think
that
congress
probably
could
have
some
sort
of
formula
which
one
would
then
apply
to
the
ground,
and
in
areas
where
the
climatic
standards
were
met,
that
formula
would
govern.
the
defense...
excuse
me.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
yes.
first,
let
me
say
that
despite
the
references
to
cold
climate,
there's
no
serious
contention
that
this
exactly
parallels
a
cold
climate,
any
definition
of
cold
climate.
the
point
is
made
by
the
government
and
stressed
by
the
atlantic
richfield
amicus
brief
that
one
is
talking
of
some
combination
of
factors
which
result
in
high
production
costs.
but
the...
and
so
that
we
seem
to
be
near
judge
friendly's
observation
that
congress
should
be
forced
into
circumlocutions.
but
the
concern
of
the
act
as
developed
in
congress
and
as
developed
in
this
litigation
for
cost
is
simply
in
order
to
ensure
that
there
are
the
appropriate
and
necessary
incentives
for
the
production
of
oil.
now,
for
those
purposes,
cost
in
the
abstract
is
not
of
interest
to
someone
interested
in
investing
in
the
production
of
oil.
what
he
is
interested
in
is
cost
in
relation
to
the
product,
let's
say
how
many
barrels
of
oil
for
cost.
when
you
look
at
it
in
that
light,
your
honor,
the
court,
it
turns
out
that
in
fact
the
production
in
alaska
is
much
less
costly
than
in
the
lower
48
states.
in
fact,
the
ratio
is
approximately
20
to
1.
that
is
to
say,
the
return
in
terms
of
barrels
of
oil
produced
per
dollar
of
drilling
costs
in
alaska
is
less
than
6
percent
of
the
return
per
dollar
invested
in
drilling
in
the
lower
48.
if
one
is
thinking
seriously
about
using
some
kind
of
geographic
line
as
a
shorthand
for
high
production
costs,
that
factor
would...
would
point
towards
exempting
the
lower
48
and
not
exempting
alaska.
let
me
say
further
that
there
are
perfectly
good
ways
to
deal
with
high
production
costs,
let's
say
to
address
the
question
of
high
production
costs
as
such.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
i
can't
rule
that
out,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
they
only
have
two
votes,
but--
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
--they
voted
against
it,
but
they
also
withdrew
the
or
ceased
the
delaying
tactics
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
up
until
december
14.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
your
honor,
it's
hard
to...
they
certainly
thought,
or
at
least
many
of
them
must
have
thought
that
this
was
a
sensible
dealing
with
the
problem
of
special
high
production
costs.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
yes,
we
would,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
in
view
of
the
facts
that
i
have
mentioned,
even
if
the
rational
basis
test
suggested
by
the
government
were
applicable,
what
you're
looking
at
is
a...
is
a
trial
which
would
be
very
difficult
and
which
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
justify
the
line
actually
drawn
by
congress.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
well,
the
two...
insofar
as
they
drew
the
geographic
line
and
insofar
as
any
part
of
any
state
was
covered
by
that
line,
it
seems
to
me
it
clearly
violates
the
requirement
of
the
uniformity
clause.
now,
on
the
question
of
production,
the
suggestion
of
the
government
that
the
validity
of
this
clause
should
flicker
on
and
off
like
a
lightbulb
in
accordance
with
whether
or
not
there
is
actual
production
seems
to
us
most
unsound.
you
are
talking
about
a
statute
which
from
its
inception
collected
tax
revenue
from
oil
producers
in
the
lower
48
states
and
which
drew
an
express
legal
line
between
their
tax
liability
and
those
in
alaska.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
no,
your
honor.
we...
we--
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
--we
acknowledge
that
the
operating
conditions
are
extremely
hostile
in
alaska,
so
that
the
costs
are
high,
but
the
costs
per
barrel
are
low.
and
in
terms...
in
the
very
terms
in
which
congress
framed
its
purposes
in
this
statute,
that
is
the
relevant
kind
of
cost.
let
me
say
a
word
about...
in
the
first
place,
congress
in
this
very
act
addressed
the
problem
of
high
production
costs
in
the
net
income
limitation.
in
the
areas
where
that
limitation
applies
one
must
simply...
one
must
show
the
existence
of
one's
costs
and
compare
them
to
the
revenue.
but
the
alaskan
producer
is
able
to
have
exempt
oil
without
any
reliance
whatsoever
on
what
his
cost
and
revenues
are.
in
terms
of
the
cases,
the
government
has
relied
heavily
on
head
money
cases,
and
it
has
quoted
the
language
of
the
court
there
that
the
tax
applied
to
all
ports
alike.
you
cannot
frame
a
comparable
sentence
about
this
tax.
it
does
not
apply
to
all
oil
wells
alike
or
to
all
newly
discovered
alike.
it
is
simply
not
comparable
to
the
head
money
cases.
second,
the
government
relies
on
language
in
the
head
money
cases
and
in
nicol
v.
ames,
suggesting
that
presence
of
reasonable
grounds
is
enough
to
justify
a
tax.
but
the
language
in
those
cases
making
that
reference
essentially
is
attributable
to
the
fact
that
before
1900
this
court
suggested
that
the
uniformity
clause
had
two
dimensions:
one,
requirement
of
geographic
uniformity;
second,
a
requirement
of
intrinsic
uniformity,
which
meant
that
any
classification
of
a
tax
by
congress
was
subject
to
review
under
the
uniformity
clause.
and
it
is
in
that
connection
that
the
court
in
those
two
cases
made
that
explanation
by
way
of
justification
of
the
tax.
in
1900
in
melvin
v.
ames
it
completely
removed
the
concept
of
intrinsic
uniformity
from
the
tax,
and
after
1900
you
do
not
see
that
language
appearing
in
uniformity
clause
cases
under
the
tax
power.
finally,
the
case
of
downes
v.
bidwell
involved
a
tax,
special
tax
on
puerto
rico
clearly
different
from
taxes
imposed
in
the
continental
united
states.
the
court
said
unless
puerto
rico
can
be
treated
as
different
because
it
is
not
a
territory
of
the
united
states,
this
tax
will
have
to
be
struck
down.
i
want
to
stress,
your
honor,
that
this
clause
has
operated
successfully,
without
inquiries
in
a
tax
policy
and
without
scrutiny
of
legislative
purpose,
for
200
years.
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of
remedy.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
essentially
so.
one
can
imagine
some
deminimis
exception,
but...
but
this
is
not
deminimis.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
that
wouldn't
seem
to
me
a
meets
and
bounds
description.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
a
meets
and
bounds
description
in
this
act
draws
a
geographic
line--
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
--i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
problem
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
be
all
right.
we
have
such
legislation,
although
not
in
tax
legislation.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
on
the
question
of
remedy,
your
honor,
there
are
three
central
vices
in
the
government's
proposal
that
this
tax
be
extended
to
alaska.
it'd
be
wrong
for
this
court
to
impose
a
tax
on
investors
with
respect
to
investment
that...
investments
that
congress
deliberately
decided
to
exempt.
it
would
be
especially
wrong
where
such
a
tax
would
be
retroactive.
it
would
be
wrong
for
this
court
to
impose
a
tax
which
jeopardizes
production,
which
might
jeopardize
production
in
an
area
where
congress
was
particularly
concerned
that
production
not
be
jeopardized.
and
finally,
it
would
be
wrong
to
violate
the
precept
laid
down
by
justice
brandeis
in
the
iowa-des
moines
national
bank
case,
discussed
at
pages
35
and
36
of
our
brief,
in
which
he
said
that
the
victim
of
an
illegal...
illegally
discriminatory
tax
should
not
be
reduced
to
asking
that
that
tax...
the
taxes
of
other
parties
be
increased.
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
no,
your
honor.
no.
we...
we...
we
agree
with
the
government
that
the
basic
test
is
congressional
intent,
but
we
believe
that
the
concept
in
the...
in
discerning
congressional
intent,
one
has
to
be
wary
of
judicial
imposition
of
taxes
that
congress
did
not
decide
to
impose.
if
there
were
an
expressed
provision
in
the
statute
that
in
the
event
of
unconstitutionality
of
the
alaska
provision,
the
remedy
should
be
to
tax
alaska,
that
would
control--
mr.
stephen
f.
williams
--yes,
your
honor.
the
imposition
of
a
tax,
taking
of
property
from
a
person
is
something
which,
according
to
the
constitution,
should
not
happen
without
an
act
of
congress.
and
the
burden,
it
seems
to
us,
should
be
very
strongly
in
the
first
instance
upon
the...
anyone
seeking
extension
of
the
tax
to
show
that
indeed
congress
made
such
a
decision.
now,
here
the
indirect
evidence...
one
may
call
it
that...
as
to
congressional
willingness
to
tax
alaska
is
all
our
way.
there's
an
overwhelming
record
showing
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
tax
alaska,
the
exempt
portions
of
alaska.
this
exemption
was
in
president
carter's
bill.
an
exemption,
similar
exemption
was
in
the
house
bill.
the
senate
finance
committee
bill
had
a
broader
exception,
one
for
newly
discovered
oil;
and
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
the...
that
exemption
was
changed
as
a
result
of
extremely
heavy
negotiations,
as
a
result
of
which
the
newly
discovered
oil
exemption
was
dropped
and
an
exemption
for
alaskan
oil
substituted
in
its
place.
that
was
a
package
transaction,
your
honor.
it
would
seem
to
us
extremely
inappropriate
to
take
one-half
of
the
package,
the
tax
on
alaska
oil,
and...
i'm
sorry...
to
discard
the
exemption
for
alaskan
oil
and
to
retain
the
tax
on
newly
discovered
oil.
now,
this
great
alliance
by
the
government
in
terms
of
direct
evidence
on
senator
long's
statements
in
the
senate
on
march
26th,
1980,
the
first
point
about
those
is
that
they
occurred
nearly
two
weeks
after
the
house
had
finally
approved
the
conference
report.
let
us
say
all
action
by
the
house
on
this
bill
was
complete
at
the
time
that
senator
long
made
his
statement.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable
that
the
house
action
could
be
said
in
any
way
to
reflect
senator
long's
views.
second,
of
course
senator
long
was
one
senator,
a
distinguished
one
and
very
much
involved
in
the
passage
of
the
act,
but
nonetheless
only
one
senator,
and
there's
no
echo
from
any
other
senator
in
support
of
him
on
this.
finally,
even
senator
long's
statement
indicates
that
in
the
terms
in
which
this
court
has
framed
the
separability
issue,
the...
he
would
not
want
separability.
that
is
to
say,
he
said
that
the...
in
the
event
of
extension
of
the
tax
to
alaska,
it
would
be
necessary
for
congress
to
go
back
and
make
adjustments
to
correct
it.
in
williams
v.
standard
oil
this
court
said
that
the
separation
is
possible
only
when
congress
would
have
been
satisfied
with
what
remains
after
the
separation.
and
it's
clear
that
even
senator
long
himself
would
not
have
been
satisfied
with
what
remains
after
severance
of
the
alaska
exemption.
the
government
also
relies
heavily
on
the
case
of
utah
power
and
light.
that,
of
course,
has
only
a
dictum.
the
court
had
no
need
whatever
to
reach
the
question
of
separability
in
that
case.
second,
the
case
is
distinguishable
in
that
the
record
there
involved
no
suggestion
whatever
that
the
idaho
legislature
was
particularly
concerned
about
this
exemption.
by
contrast,
of
course,
here
we
have
an
exemption
to
which
congress
showed
a
continuous
commitment
over
the
entire
period
through
which
the
legislation
was
considered.
and
i
may
say
the
unified
theme
and
the
painstaking
carving
out
of
the
legislation
by
the
congress,
to
which
mr.
wallace
has
alluded
is
and
was
involved
in
that.
second,
the...
the
dictum
in
utah
power
and
light
was
ill
considered.
clearly
the
issue
had
not
been
thoroughly
litigated.
the
court
makes
no
reference
whatever
to
the
decision
of
iowa-des
moines
national
bank,
which
was
at
that
time
and
remains
the
leading
case
on
the
proper
remedy
for
a
tax
which
illegally
discriminates.
and
since
the...
under
the...
as
the
court
was
discussing
the
matter
in
utah
power
and
light,
what
was
at
issue
was
an
illegal
discrimination.
the
controlling
case
at
that
time
was
iowa...
the
iowa-des
moines
national
bank
case.
moreover,
the
utah
power
and
light
dictum
occurs
in
1932.
in
1946
this
court
in
the
township
of
hillsborough
case
said
that
the
iowa-des
moines...
not
only
said
that
the
iowa-des
moines
national
bank
case
was
good
law,
but
it
applied
it,
saying
that
a
state
providing
a
remedy
for
illegal
discrimination
which
limited
the
taxpayer
to
seeking
extension
of
the
tax
to
others
was
not
providing
an
adequate
remedy,
and
that,
therefore,
federal
jurisdiction
was
available.
there
is
also
reliance
by
the
government
on
the
general
separability
clause
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
section
7852(a).
the
difficulty
with
that
clause,
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
is
that
the
invalid
provision,
reading
the
statute
in
its
natural
way,
is
the
tax,
not
the
exemption.
there
is
nothing
invalid,
quite
clearly,
about
failing
to
tax
particular
producers
in
alaska.
what
is
invalid
is
the
combination
of
taxing
people
in
the
other
49
states
and,
in
combination
with
that,
failing
to
tax
similar
production
in
alaska.
i
may
say
that
the
very
naturalness
of
that
reading
is
evident
to
us
in
judge
white's
concurring
opinion
in
the
minneapolis
star
case
where
finding
the
exemption
illegal,
he
concluded
automatically
and
naturally
that
the
tax
was
therefore
illegal.
in
addition,
the...
it
seems
to
us
that
section
7852(a)
must
be
construed
in
the
light
of
the
law
then
prevailing
and
now
prevailing...
that
is
to
say,
the
decision
in
iowa-des
moines
national
bank,
and
that
is
to
say,
treating
the
problem
of
remedying
an
illegal
discrimination
in
taxes
as
a
special
kind
of
remedial
problem.
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
that
congress
in
the...
in
adopting
section
7852(a)
was
aiming
at
overruling
the
established
law
on
that
point,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
natural
conclusion
is
that
it
had
no
intention
at
all
to
undercut
the
then
prevailing
rule
on
the
matter.
the
only...
i
may
say
that
the
only
lower
court
interpretation
of
section
7852(a)
that
deals
with
the
problem...
that
interprets
the
clause
in
the
context
of
a
tax
that
illegally
discriminates
is
the
moritz
case
from
the
tenth
circuit,
and
there
the
court
construed
it
in
the
way
that
we
have
suggested
here;
that
is
to
say,
to
extend
relief
to
the
taxpayer
who
had
been
discriminated
against
rather
than
burdening
taxpayers
who
had
been
illegally
benefitted.
i
may
say
that
the...
if
i
may
return
to
utah
power
and
light,
the
government
argues
that
that
is
a
case
which
can
be
completely
disregarded...
i'm
sorry...
which
is
not
at
all
in
conflict
with
iowa-des
moines
national
bank
because
iowa-des
moines
national
bank
did
not
involve
separability.
it
is
quite
true
that
in
iowa-des
moines
national
bank
separatibility
per
se
was
not
at
stake;
that
is
to
say,
the
problem
was
not
the
remedying
a
statute
which
discriminated
illegally.
the
discrimination
arose
because
a
county
auditor
had
illegally
made
certain
decisions
to
the
benefit
of
the
complaining
taxpayer.
there
is
that...
there
is
that
nominal
distinction.
the
impact
of
that
distinction,
it
seems
to
us,
your
honor,
cuts
entirely
our
way.
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
iowa-des
moines
national
bank
what
the
legislature
wanted.
the
legislature
wanted
both
sides
of
discrimination
to
be
taxed
at
the
higher
rate.
the
county
auditor
had
illegally
in
violation
of
statute
produced
lower
rates
for
a
certain
set
of
taxpayers,
and
despite
the
obvious
intent
of
the
legislature
there,
the
court
said
that
the
remedy
must
be
equalization
of
taxes
by
lowering
the
adversely
affected
taxpayers'
taxes
to
the
level
of
or
to
the
rate
which
had
been
applied
to
those
who
had
illegally
benefitted.
your
honor,
the
court...
the
remedies
suggested
by
the
government
have
in
common
that...
the...
the
government
has
suggested
a
variety
of
remedies
throughout
this
litigation:
one,
that
the
tax
be
extended
to
alaska:
second,
that
the
tax
be
invalidated
only
insofar
as
it
applies
to
newly
discovered
oil;
and
third,
a
position
adopted
in
the
district
court
and
apparently
not
pressed
here,
that
the
court
itself
carve
out
some
sort
of
exemption
for
cold
climate,
distance
from
markets
and
things
of
that
sort.
the...
all
of
these...
the
very
multiplicity
of
proposals
by
the
government
suggests
to
us
the
highly
legislative
character
of
its
remedial
suggestions.
the
choice
between
these
different
proposals
obviously
involves
very
different
trade-offs
between
revenue
collection
for
the
government,
between
the
problem
of
persons
who
have
invested
in
reliance
on
a
particular
status
quo,
and
the
problems
of
disincentive
to
production.
and
those
trade-offs
are
surely
legislative
nature
and
ones
to
be
made
by
congress.
in
addition,
within
the
remedies
proposed
by
the
government
there
are
legislative
decisions
to
be
made.
the...
whether
or
not
if
alaskan
oil
should
be
taxed
the
taps
adjustment,
a
special
provision,
the
details
of
which
i
needn't
give
you,
should
be
applied
to
that
oil
is
a
question
which
would
be
open
if
the
court
should
extend
the
tax
to
alaska.
how
the...
the
revenues
from
the
exempt
portions
of
alaska
should
affect
the
computation
of
the
phaseout
provisions,
which
the
phaseout
is
supposed
to
start
after
$227
billion
in
net
revenues
have
been
collected,
how
those
provisions
should
be
adjusted
to
reflect
extension
to
alaska
are
clearly
legislative
ones
and
do
not
seem
appropriate
for
the
court.
let
me
say
a
brief
word
about
the
question
of
ripeness,
your
honors.
the...
this
is...
the
ripeness
claim
here
is
different
from
any
other
that
one
is
familiar
with.
here
one
has
a
tax
which
from
its
start
has
led
to
the
taxpayers
in
the
lower
48
states
paying
taxes.
in
addition,
the
line
illegally
drawn
by
the
statute
is
one
which
had
its
effects
immediately
in
terms
of
attracting
capital
to
the
exempt
areas
of
alaska
which
otherwise
producers
in
the
lower
48
states
might
have
attracted.
the
government's
proposal
that
the
constitutionality
be
dependent
on
production
suggests
this
continual
on
and
off
possibility,
which
has
no
precedent
in
your
ripeness
jurisprudence.
and,
finally,
the
cases
which
have
overcome
ripeness
and
dealt
with
a
statute
which
has
not
taken
effect,
which,
of
course...
and
ours
has
taken
effect
in
terms
of
forcing
the
collection
of
revenue...
cases
dealing
with
that
have
never
said
that
the
illegality
will
begin
only
when
the
effect
begins.
they
have
spoken
of
the
act
being
unlawful
at
the
time
of
the
adjudication
even
though
the
effect
is
only
anticipated.
in
pierce
v.
society
of
sisters,
for
example,
the
court
talks
about
the
proper
role
of
an
equity
court
to
give
relief
before
the...
to
give
relief
immediately
for
unlawful
action,
referring
to
the
statute
as
passed.
there's
continual
reference
to
the
enormous
sums
at
stake
in
the
event
that
the
government's...
in
the
event
that
the
taxpayers'
proposed
remedy
is
adopted.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
need
not
be
a
concern,
that
the
congress
has
within
its
power
curative
measures
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
shy
off
from
giving
the
natural
remedy
despite
the
presence
of
those...
despite
the
fact
that
the
immediate
result
would
be
the
invalidation
of
a
statute
which
on
its
face
involves
large
sums.
your
honor,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
here
we
have
a
clause
which
has
worked
effectively
to
restrain
regional
preferences
and
jealousies
without
the
courts
being
concerned
with
tax
policy
or
legislative
motivation.
there
is
no
reason
in
view
of
the
case
with
which
congress
can
handle
the
problems
which
are
alleged
by
the
government
to
exist
without
drawing
geographic
lines,
there
is
no
need
to
adopt
some
substitute
test,
the
testing...
the
proof
of
which
would
be
extremely
complex.
as
far
as
remedy
is
concerned,
the
extension
of
a
tax
to
investors
that
congress
decided
to
exempt,
to
production
that
it
was
concerned
to
preserve,
and
leaving
taxpayers
in
a
situation
where
they
had
no
remedy
but
to
increase
the
taxes
of
others
would
not
be
wrong...
would
not
be
right
or
consistent
with
the
prevailing
cases
on
remedy.

but

should

you,
your
honor.
