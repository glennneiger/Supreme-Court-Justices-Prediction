before
you
do
that,
mr.
williams,
may
i
ask
one
question
about
your
theory?
in
some
of
the
briefs
they
suggest
there
might
be
a
distinction
between
physical
geography
and
political
geography.
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if...
would
you
take
the
position
that
you
could
never
comply
with
the
uniformity
clause
if
you
described
an
exempt
area
by
meets
and
bounds,
say,
instead
of
by
political
boundaries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but...
but
you
would
say,
for
example,
all
coal
mined
above
5,000
or
something
would
be
equally
subject
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
understand
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
understand.
but
if
you
view
it
without
meets
and
bounds,
what
if
you
did
it
by
altitude
then,
say,
another
geographic
way,
another
physical
geographic
boundary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
meets
and
bounds
would
not.
