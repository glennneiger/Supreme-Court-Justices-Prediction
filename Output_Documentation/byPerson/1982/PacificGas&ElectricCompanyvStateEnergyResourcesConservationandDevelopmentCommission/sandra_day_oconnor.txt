in
ca
9--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
we
have
a
copy
of
that
in
the
material
you
have
filed
with
the
court,
mr.
mcdonough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcdonough,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
is
it
your
position
that
under
the
federal
legislation
previously
existing
that
the
states
can
determine
whether
to
permit
a
power
plant
to
be
built
at
all
within
a
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
it
decide
that
it
wants
a
nuclear
plant
or
does
not
want
a
nuclear
plant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
the
states
just
say
nuclear
power
plants
cost
too
much,
and
therefore
we
don't
want
them?
and
is
that
what
they've
done?
and
maybe
they
cost
too
much
because
of
the
waste
disposal
problem.
can
a
state
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
the
state
is
arguing
they've
done
just
that,
aren't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
subsection
(4)
in
the
act?
