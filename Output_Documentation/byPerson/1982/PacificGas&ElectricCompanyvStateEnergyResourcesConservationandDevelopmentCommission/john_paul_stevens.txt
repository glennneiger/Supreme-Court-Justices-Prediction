justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
only
role
of
the
states
in
that
statute
is
in
the
selection
of
the
permanent
disposal
site,
isn't
it?
isn't
that
all
the
state
participation
that's
involved
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
really
doesn't
have
much
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
california's
just
saying
we
want
to
wait
until
we
know
what
the
federal
solution
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
also
made
it
rather
clear
that
the
final
federal
answer
won't
be
available
for
several
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
here
is
whether...
can
the
states
say
we
want
to
wait
until
that
answer
is...
i'm
not
suggesting
one
way
or
another,
but
i
don't
really
see
that
that
bears
on
the
preemption
issue
that
we
have
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question...
one
of
the
questions
here
is
whether
california
can
say
we
want
to
wait
until
january
1,
1989
before
we
okay
any
more
of
these
plants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
claiborne,
doesn't
that
just,
in
one
sense,
just
mean
that
the
utilities
can
know
when
one
of
the
conditions
that
the
state
wishes
to
impose
will
be
met
so
they
can
plan
on
saying
well,
we'll
assume
the
federal
deadlines
will
be
met,
so
we
can
target...
we
know
when
we
will
also
meet
the
state
condition,
which
is
there
must
be
permanent
storage
in
existence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
claiborne,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
your
interpretation
of
24.2,
the
california
statute
that
says
that
no
nuclear
fission
thermal
power
plants
shall
be
permitted
land
use
in
the
state
until
after
the
permanent
storage
condition
has
been
met.
what
does
that
mean
about
"shall
be
permitted
land
use
in
the
state?
"
they
cannot
construct
the
plant
or
cannot
operate
the
plant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
neither.
could
not
even
begin
construction
until
the...
the...
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr....
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
what
you
just
said.
assuming
they
made
a
total
decision
to
have
no
nuclear
plants
within
the
state,
you're
arguing
that
that
would
not
be
preempted
even
if
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
the
motive
was
merely
they
thought
they
were
unsafe?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
takes
the
responsibility
for...
who
takes
the
responsibility
for
shutdowns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
takes
the
responsibility
for
shutdowns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in...
in
sort
of
an
indemnity
agreement,
or
how
do
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
say
there's
a
very
substantial
business
interruption
cost
as
a
result
of
it.
who
bears
the
loss?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
the
federal
government.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
takes
none
of
the
investment
risk.
