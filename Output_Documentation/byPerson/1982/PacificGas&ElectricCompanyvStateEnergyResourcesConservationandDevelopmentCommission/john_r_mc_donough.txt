mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
substantive
issues
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
california
can
place
a
moratorium
on
the
construction
of
nuclear
power
plants
until
the
california
energy
commission,
the
principal
respondent
here,
has
determined
to
its
satisfaction
that
there
exists
a
demonstrated
technology
or
means
for
the
disposal
of
high-level
nuclear
waste.
the
second
substantive
issue
is
whether
california
can
refuse
to
permit
a
specific
nuclear
power
plant
to
be
built
in
the
state
until
the
energy
commission
finds
that
there
are
or
will
be
facilities
with
adequate
capacity
to
store
at
any
given
time
the
spent
nuclear
fuel
produced
by
the
plant
plus
all
of
the
fuel
loaded
into
the
plant's
reactor
at
that
point
in
time.
the
first
of
those
issues
is
raised
by
the
enactment
by
california
in
1976
of
section
25524.2
of
the
california
public
resources
code,
referred
to
in
the
briefs
as
the
waste
disposal
statute;
and
the
second
issue
is
raised
by
the
enactment
in
that
same
year
of
public
resources
code
section
25524.1(b),
referred
to
as
the
waste
storage
statute.
petitioners
contend
that
both
of
those
statues
are
invalid
as
preempted
by
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954,
as
supplemented
by
the
nuclear
waste
policy
statute
of
1982,
which
was
signed
by
the
president
just
ten
days
ago.
there
are
also,
however...
there
is
also,
however,
before
the
court
the
question
of
the
validity
or
the...
the
question
of
the
justiciability
of
those
issues
or
the
ripeness
of
those
issues
for
determination.
and
i
shall
address
the
ripeness
issue
first.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
it
is
in
our
view.
it
is
supportive
of
the
position
that
we
are
taking
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
statute--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
opportunity
to
consider--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes,
your
honor.
now,
that
statute
was
first
called
to
this
court's
attention
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
13
when
we
noted
that
it
had
then
been
enacted
by
congress,
not
yet
signed
by
the
president.
it
was
again
called
to
the
court's
attention
last
week
by
the
letter
of
the
solicitor
general
informing
the
court
that
this
statute
had
been
enacted.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
well--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--your
honor,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
case
can
be
disposed
and
ought
to
be
disposed
of
by
this
court
taking
account
of
that
statute
as
well
as
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954,
as
amended;
but
i
take
it
that
would
be
a
question
for
the
court
to
decide.
we
will
be
making
reference
to
the
1982
statute
in
the
course
of
our
argument
this
afternoon,
as
i
believe
indeed
the
solicitor
general
will.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
a
copy
of
the
statute,
i'm
informed,
was
sent
to
the
court
by
the
solicitor
general
last
week.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
it
is
a
lengthy
statute,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
well,
our
position
is,
your
honor,
that
it...
it
stands
as
a
reaffirmation
of
the
view
of
the
federal
government's
responsibility
for
and
willingness
to
accept
responsibility
for
and
deal
effectively
with
the
problems
both
of
the
disposal
of
radioactive
waste
on
a
schedule
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
pursuant
to
procedures
described
in
the
statute,
and
that
it
also
deals
extensively
with
the
question
of
interim
storage
of
waste--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--indeed,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
we
were
here
and
all
the
briefs
were
filed,
except
the
reply
brief
by
ourselves.
the
statute
was
enacted,
as
i
say,
signed
by
the
president
only
on
january
7,
1983.
but
it
does...
it
does...
it
represents
the
facing
up,
if
you
will,
of
the
federal
government
to
two
problems
that
are
the
subject
matter
of
the
statutes
before
this
court;
that
is
to
say,
how
will
the
nation
deal
with
the
problem
of
the
disposal
of
high-level
nuclear
waste,
and
how...
and
before
that
problem
can
be
solved,
how
will
the
nation
deal
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
interim
storage
of
that
waste
pending
its
ultimate
disposal.
and
in
both
of
those
respects
the
statute
assumes
a
federal
responsibility,
sets
out
procedures
to
be
followed
by
the
federal
government,
and
sets
a
timetable
for
the
accomplishment
of
objectives,
and
specifically
defines
in
each
category
the
role
of
the
states,
the
precise
role
which
the
states
are
to
have
in
dealing
with
this
problem.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes.
your
honor,
what
the
statute
does--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--no,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
the
contention
here
is
that
the
states
may
deal,
as
california
has,
with
the
problems
of
final
disposal
of
nuclear
waste,
on
the
one
hand,
and
interim
storage
of
nuclear
waste--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
message
from
the
statute
is
that
congress
does
not
want
to
wait,
wants
the
subject
matter
of
the
continued
operation
of
nuclear
plants
to
proceed,
and
has
set
forth
in
detail
the
procedures
to
be
followed
to
that
end.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
well,
the
final
federal...
that's
right.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
well,
your
honor,
what
our
position
is
with
respect
to
the
disposal
of
nuclear
waste,
that
the
federal
government
has
assumed
responsibility
for
that,
has
set
out
a
procedure
to
be
followed
to
reach
that
end,
has
set
a
target
date
of
january
1,
1989
for
the
licensing
of
the
first
disposal
facility.
the
nrc
in
the
meantime
has
already
decided,
as
we
of
course
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
that
as
far
as--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--yes,
your
honor.
as
i--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--well,
all
right.
the
nrc
has
already
said
in
that
respect
insofar
as
it
is
concerned
the
licensing
of
nuclear
power
plants
by
the
nrc
need
not
wait
the
solution
of
the
long
range
disposal
problem.
we
think
the
statute
in
dealing
with
the
problem
in
the
way
that
it
has
dealt
with
the
problem
and
does
deal
with
the
problem
indicates,
reaffirms
the
federal
government's
view
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
federal
government
to
decide,
and
that
it
should
decide
all
matters
in
relation
to
the
problems
of
the
disposal
of
high-level
nuclear
waste;
further
affirms
the
federal
determination
to
go
forward
and
solve
that
problem,
and
therefore
buttresses
what
we
say
is
affirmed
and
found
in
the
'54
act,
as
amended,
in
any
event.
it
does
seem
to
be
a
current
enactment
of
considerable
relevance
to
the
issues
before
the
court,
and
we
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
brought
before
the
court
for
its
consideration.
turning
to
the
issues
raised
by
the
respondents
as
to
the
justiciability
of
the
questions
before
the
court
this
afternoon,
respondents
have
contended
that
because
the
court's
writ
brings
before
the
court
only
the
two
statutes
that
i
have
mentioned
and
not
others,
that
the
court
here
really
lacks
article
iii
jurisdiction.
that
contention
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
action
as
filed
below
challenged
the
validity
of
a
large
number
of
statutes
included
in
california's
warren-alquist
act,
and
in
particular
challenged
the
validity
of
about
a
dozen
statutes
which
taken
together
set
forth
a
procedure
whereby
one
wishing
to
build
a
nuclear
power
plant
in
california
must
file
an
application
for
first
a...
a...
what's
called
a
notice
of
intention
and
later
an
application
for
certification,
and
then
engage
upon
a
procedure
in
which
the
california
energy
commission
subjects
that
application
to
the
same
kind
of
inquiries
as
are
made
by
the
nrc
in
the
case
of
an
application
for
a
license
to
build
and
later
to
operate
a
nuclear
power
plant.
we
said
all
of
those
statutes,
which
we
describe
as
the
certification
system
statutes,
were
also
invalid.
those
questions
are
not
before
the
court
for
decision,
and
so
the
contention
is
that
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
get
a
redress
from
a
decision
of
this
court;
that
our
injury
is
not
redressable.
we
have
two
responses
to
make
to
that,
the
first
of
which
is
that
a
favorable
decision
by
the
court
on
the
two
issues
before
the
court
this
afternoon
would
dispose
of
two
discrete
injuries
to
the
petitioners
arising
out
of
these
statutes.
it
would...
it
would...
it
would
strike
down
the...
the...
the
moratorium
statute
and
would
as
well
strike
down
california's
attempt
to
become
involved
in
the
question
of
deciding
how
nuclear
waste
should
be
stored
before
it's
disposed
of.
such
a
favorable
decision
would
also
in...
of
necessity
set
out
the
rationale
of
the
court's
decision
in
terms
that
could
well
be
applicable
and
would
be
applicable,
we
are
certain,
to
the
other
statutes
that
are
challenged
by
petitioners
or
were
challenged
below.
and
this
particularly
with
respect
to
the
waste
storage
statute,
because
that
really
is
functionally
a
part
of
the
certification
system.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes.
indeed
that
is
his
position,
your
honor.
my
response
to
it
is
simply
to
say
first
we
will
have
this...
we
will
have
this
enlightenment
from
the
court
which
will
afford
an
opportunity
at
that
point
to
reassess
the
situation
of
the
petitioners
to
see
whether
the
concerns
they
felt
at
the
point
in
time
that
the
action
was
filed
are
still
sufficiently
valid
to
preclude
them
from
going
ahead.
the
second
point
we
would
make
in
response
to
this
contention
is
that
certain
redressability
by
this
court,
its
judgment
or
decision,
has
not
always
been
an
absolute
requirement
of
article
iii
jurisdiction.
in
that...
in
that
respect
we
refer
to
the
orr
against
orr
case
decided
in
1979
where
the
court
decided
and
struck
down
the
alabama
alimony
statute
because
it
did
not
impose
an
obligation
on
both
husbands
and
wives
to
pay
alimony,
even
though
it
was
not
certain
at
that
point
that
the
husband
petitioner
would
have
relief
by
reason
of
this
court's
decision,
both
because
there
was
a
possibility
that
he
was
bound
by
contract
in
any
event
to
pay
the
alimony,
and
because
the
legislature
of
alabama
might
revise
the
statute
to
impose
a
duty
on
both
parties.
for
those
reasons
we
believe
that
the
first
point
raised
by
the
respondents
as
to
the
ripeness
or
justiciability
of
the
issues
is
not
well
taken.
with
respect
to
the
ripeness
of
the
moratorium
statute
itself,
we
believe
there
simply
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
entirely
correct.
the
court
said
that
the
challenged
statutes
stand
as
an
absolute
barrier
to
the
construction
of
the
proposed
plants,
and
that
that
barrier
be
removed
by
striking
down
the
statutes.
that
would
satisfy,
we
feel,
the
article
iii
component
of
ripeness.
the
court
also
said
that
the
issue
was
purely
a
legal
one
and
that
it
would
not
be...
its
judgment
on
that
issue
would
not
be
helped
significantly
by
delay,
and
that
delay
would
cause
substantial
hardship
to
the
utilities.
that,
we
think,
was
the
appropriate
decision
with
respect
to
ripeness
on
that
particular
statute,
and
that
the
same
reasoning,
the
same
rationale
should
have
been
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
section
25524.1(b)
for
the
same
reasons;
that
is
to
say,
it
is
one
of
the
statutes
that
constitutes
a
barrier.
the
issue
is
a
legal
one.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
preemption
itself,
in
our
view
when
california
enacted
these
two
statutes
in
1976
it
could
not
have
entered
a
more
preempted
area
of
this
subject
matter
of
nuclear
power
plants
and
their
governance.
congress
has
always
accepted
responsibility
for
the...
for
the
disposition,
the
storage
and
disposition
of
nuclear
waste.
as
i
referred
to
earlier,
the
nrc
has
decided
that
it
will
not
withhold
its
licensing
procedures
or
withhold
a
license
merely
because
the
long-range
disposal
problem
has
not
yet
been
solved.
i
referred
earlier
to
the
1982
statute.
let
me
just
incorporate
that
by
reference,
noting
that
what
it
does
is
to
set
out
with
respect
to
both
long-range
disposal
and
interim
storage
specific
procedures
whereby
the
federal
government
assumes
responsibility
for
solving
those
problems
within
a
short
space
of
time,
and
with
respect
to
interim
storage
particularly,
provides
that
the
federal
government
shall
assist
the
utilities
to
be
certain
that
there
will
be
ample
interim
storage
available
until
the
depository
problem
is
solved.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
until--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--yes,
your
honor,
in
several
respects.
that
is
to
say,
first
the
state
can
decide
whether
there's
a
need
for
any
kind
of
a
power
plant
and
decide
that
question
negatively.
the
question,
the
state
can
decide
whether
a
particular
power
plant
is
too
expensive.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
no.
it
cannot
decide
simply...
the
state,
in
our
view,
your
honor,
simply
could
not
pass
a
statute
saying
we
will
not
have
any
nuclear
power
plants
in
this
state.
that
runs
counter
to
the
promoting,
encouraging,
fostering
policy
of
the
federal
government
and...
and
the...
as
expressed
in
the
1954
act.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
could.
the
thing
that...
that
makes
the
situation
here
different
is
the
fact
that
congress
has
evinced
a
strong
intention
to
have
nuclear
power
plants
as
part
of
any
utility's
mix,
assuming
that
there
is
no...
the
states
cannot
discriminate
against
nuclear
power,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
congress
has
done
this
in
a
variety
of
ways,
your
honor.
first,
they
have
made
the
nuclear
materials
available
to
the
private
sector.
second,
they
have
made
the
technology
available
and
have
provided
research
and
development
to
develop
that
technology.
third,
they
have
priced...
they
have
passed
the
price-anderson
act
which
limits
liability
of
the
private
operator
and
provides
funds
to
help
them
meet
that
financial
responsibility.
fourth,
they
have
provided
an
expert
agency
to
license
these
plants
and
to
give
the
public
confidence
by
its
licensing
process.
fifth,
they
have
just
as
recently
as
ten
days
ago
enacted
new
legislation
carrying
forth
the
federal
policy
that
there
shall
be
nuclear
power
plants.
what
we
say
is
the
states
can
apply
those...
can
make
those
decisions
normally
within
its...
its
capability
of
making,
applying
them
in
a
nondiscriminatory
way
against
nuclear
power
plants.
what
the
states
cannot
do
is
to
regulate
the
construction
or
operation
of
nuclear
power
plants
or
the
interim
storage
or
long-range
disposal
of
nuclear
waste.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes,
sir.
if
it
was
making
a
nondiscriminatory
application
of
a
general
decision
by
that
state
not
to
have
any
new
power
plants--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--not
involved
in
this
case,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
what
we're
saying
is
whether...
first
we
say
yes,
they
are
safety
statutes.
and
second
we
say
whether
or
not
they're
safety
statutes,
they
are
statutes
that
deal
with
the
very
subject
matters
that
are
regulated
by
the
federal
government...
the
construction
and
operation
of
nuclear
power
plants.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
we
say
they
can
do
that,
your
honor,
if
they
do
it,
again,
in
a
nondiscriminatory,
evenhanded
way.
if
they
say
$3
billion
is
simply
too
much
and
we
won't
let...
we
won't
have
a
coal
plant
or
a
hydro
plant
or
a
nuclear
plant--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
they
make
an...
a
fair
determination.
after
all,
they're
entitled
to
take
into
account
the
cost
of
a
plant,
and
if
they
decide
that
this
factor--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--well,
they...
no,
they
did
not
do
more
than
that
here.
in
fact,
they
didn't
do
that
much
here.
but
in
any
event,
our
position...
our
position
is
that
they
can
make
that
kind
of...
that
kind
of
decision.
the
kind
of
decision
that
is
preempted
is
the
decision
that
relates
to
the
construction
and
operation
of
nuclear
power
plants.
the
kind
of...
the
very
decisions
that
the
nrc
makes
are
the
decisions
which
the
state
cannot
make.
now,
that
means
that
there
are
dividing
lines
and
distinctions
to
be
drawn;
but
we
think
those
are
required
by
the
federal
policy
expressed
in
the
'54
act.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
it
is
said
here
that
the
california
legislation
does
not
reflect
concern
about
safety,
but
on
its
face
it
does
not
say
that
it
does
not
reflect
that
concern;
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
these
statutes
apply
only
to
plants
built
in
california.
should
a
california
utility
decide
to
build
a
plant
outside
california,
these
statues
do
not
apply,
and
yet
the
same
problems
of
the
clog
in
the...
in
the
fuel
cycle
and
so
forth
would
then...
would
then
be
applicable.
so...
and
so
we
don't
concede
at
all
that
these
are
not
safety-related
statutes.
number
two,
mr.
tribe
has
said
that
the
states
traditionally
have
the
right
to
decide
what
technologies
may
be
used
within
the
state
to
generate
electric
power.
that
is
true
subject
to
this
particular
act.
we
believe
that
the
principle
here,
the
preemption
principle
here,
is
this:
that
a
state
statute
is
preempted
which
stands
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
and
execution
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
congress,
as
stated
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
back
in
hines
against
davidovitz.
the
key
to
the
decision
of
this
case,
we
think,
is
for
the
court
to
make
its
own
decision
respecting
what
can
be
derived
from
the
course
of
federal
legislation
and
regulation
of
this
activity
over
the
years.
what
we
find
there
is
that
congress
did
make
the
decision
and
has
continued
to
make
the
decision
as
recently
as
1982
that
there
shall
be
a
nuclear
component
in
the
mix
of
any
state
if
it
possibly
can
be
fitted
in.
and
then
the
congress
has
really
in
effect
divided
the
decision-making
process
as
to
whether
it
shall
go
in
into
two
components.
certain
matters
are
for
the
states
to
decide.
we've
never
challenged
it.
need,
cost,
whether
it
goes
into
the
rate
base,
how
much
goes
into
the
rate
base
are
for
the
states
to
decide,
condedely;
but
there
are
questions
that
the
federal
government
has
decided
it
will
decide.
it
will
decide
the
question
of
whether
it
should...
you
should
not
have
a
plant
because
of
concern
about
interim
storage.
the
federal
government
will
decide
whether
you
shall
not
have
a
plant
because
of
concern
about
ultimate
waste
disposal.
the
federal
government
will
decide
how
a
plant
should
be
designed,
how
it
should
be
constructed,
and
how
it
should
be
operated.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
i
think
what
it
has
done
is
to...
congress,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
very
clearly
said
back
in
1954
and
has
continued
to
say
we
believe
that
the
best
interest
of
this
country
in
the
long
range
will
be
served
by
having
nuclear
power
in
this
country,
and
we
are
going
to
do
everything
we
can
do
to
bring
it
about,
do
everything
we
can
do
to
encourage
the
private
sector
to
get
in
and
stay
in.
that's
why
they
enacted
the
price-anderson
act.
that's
why
they...
they
have...
they
gave
the
technology
to
the
private
sector.
congress
has
decided
this
is
wisdom
for
this
country
to
have
the
nuclear
option.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress
has
said
the
states
must
have
it
at
any
cost,
economic
or
otherwise.
congress
has
said
we
will
take
the
responsibility
for
design,
for
construction,
for
operation.
we
will
take
responsibility
for
safety
and
the
disposal
of
the
spent
fuel.
and...
and
we...
we...
when
we
have
decided
those
things,
they
are
decided
for
everybody,
for
all
the
states,
for
the
whole
nation.
congress
takes
that
much
responsibility
but
does
not
purport
to
preempt
the
states
from
making
the
kinds
of
judgments
which
congress
is
not
trying
to
force
it
down
anybody's
throat
but
trying
to
say
we
will
take
certain
responsibility;
you
take
certain
responsibility;
together
we
will
work
it
out.
we
will
have
nuclear
power.
that
is
the
federal
policy--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
i
think
it's
clear--
[laughter]
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
of
the
nuclear
plant?
the
federal
government.
the
nrc,
the
nrc,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
well,
you
mean
respecting
whether
a
particular
plant
should
be
shut
down
at
a
particular
point
in
time?
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
well,
i
take
it
either
the
shareholders
or
the
ratepayers
or
both
bear
the
cost.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
not
the
federal
government,
no.
the
federal
government
has
assumed
a
substantial
amount
of
responsibility,
financial
responsibility,
for
the
possibility
of
a
nuclear
incident,
as
you
know,
under
the
price-anderson
act.
the
federal
government
has
manifested
a
continuing
policy
of
wishing
there
to
be
nuclear
power
plants
and
going
out
of
its
way
in
every
respect
to
see
that
eventuality
comes--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--it
doesn't
take
the
investment
risk,
no,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
take
that
risk.
but...
and
it
doesn't
insist
that
the
states
invest
more
money
than
they
would
normally
invest
in
a
plant.
but
with
respect
to
the
question
of
if
there
is
a
risk
of
shutdown,
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
government
has
said
that's
a
risk
we
must
all
assume.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
yes,
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
has.
i
think
that
that,
however--
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
--well,
i
think
that
we
have
brought
the
question
here,
and
it
seems
to
me
now
that
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari,
the
question
now
is
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
it
agrees
with
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
john
r.
mc
donough
well,
yes,
sir.
about
the...
about
the
policy
reflected
in
the
california
law.
and
it
seems
reasonable
that
the
court
now
would
take
its
own
look
at
this
and
decide
whether
the
case...
whether
this
law
is
safety-oriented
or
not.
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
in
context
would
suggest
that
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
