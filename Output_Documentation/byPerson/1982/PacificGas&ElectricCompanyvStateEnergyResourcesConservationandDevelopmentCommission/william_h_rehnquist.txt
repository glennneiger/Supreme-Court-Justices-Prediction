justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
sense
you
came
before
it
was
enacted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understood
respondents'
contention
to
be,
mr.
mcdonough,
that
your
contentions
had
been
kind
of
like
perhaps
christmas
trees
in
parallel
rather
than
in
series;
that
it
was
the
combined
effect
of
each
and
every
one
of
these
statutes
that
caused
you
to
be
uncertain,
your
client
to
be
uncertain
as
to
whether
he
could
go
ahead
and
build.
and
that
if
you
couldn't
challenge
a
part
of
this
combined
weight,
so
to
speak,
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
just
partial
relief
was
going
to
solve
your
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
it
pass
a
statute
saying
we
will
not
have
any
hydroelectric
plants
in
this
state;
we'll
use
only
coal-fired
plants?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can't
california
count
on
its
own
state
utility
commission
to
follow
state
policy
and
to
set
its
face
against
this
passing
on
of
costs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
bills
that
congress
didn't
pass
have
really
never
carried
much
weight
here,
have
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
of
course,
one
of
the
reasons
we
don't
give
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
what
congress
didn't
enact
is
perhaps
some
people
voted
against
it
because
they
thought
it
was
already
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
that
discussion
occur?
was
that
in
the
context
of
the
'54
act
or
the
'59--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
that
where
the
preemption
of
radiation
hazards
occurs,
or
is
that
in
the
'59
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
pre...
preexisting
role
with
respect
to
electricity.
the
states
had
never
had
any
part
in
regulating
atomic
energy.
indeed,
there
was
no
civilian
regulation
right
after
the
war;
it
was
all
military.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
was
said.
it
certainly
wasn't
said
in
haec
verba
in
the
'54
statute,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
that...
is
that
a
'54
and
not
a
'59
section?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe--
--you
don't
completely
ignore
article
vi,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
if
your
views
were
to
prevail,
could
a
district
court,
such
as
judge
real
here,
inquire
into
the
motives
of
the
california
legislature?
you
argued
a
legislative
motivating
case
here
last
year
in
the
california
bus
amendment
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
mcdonough,
that
suggests
that
the
federal
government
has
given
nuclear
power
a
kind
of
preferred
position
over
coal
generation
and
hydroelectric.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
certainly...
that
certainly
is
forcing
to
a
certain
extent
down
somebody's
throat,
isn't
it...
together
we
will
have--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--nuclear
power.
