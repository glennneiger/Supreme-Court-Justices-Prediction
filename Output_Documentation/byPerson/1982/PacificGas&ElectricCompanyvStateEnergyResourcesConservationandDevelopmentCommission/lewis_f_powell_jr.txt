f.
powell,
jr.
you
do
not,
i
assume,
question
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
to
preempt
this
field
if
it
specifically
did
so.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
tribe,
you've
emphasized
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
in
safety.
if
this
case
had
arisen
in
1973,
what
do
you
think
the
primary
concern
of
the
federal
government
would
have
been,
in
light
of
the
embargo
of
oil
from
the
middle
east?
