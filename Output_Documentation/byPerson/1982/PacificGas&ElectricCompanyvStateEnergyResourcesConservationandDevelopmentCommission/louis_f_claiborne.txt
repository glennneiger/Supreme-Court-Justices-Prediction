mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
perhaps
a
word
about
the
relevance
of
the
new
statute
enacted
ten
days
ago.
it
may
be...
we
can't
say
that
it
wouldn't...
that
it
would
be
wholly
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
remand
to
the
court
below
to
reconsider
the
case
in
light
of
that
statute.
we
do
not
urge
that
course
because
we
are
not
at
the
jurisdictional
stage.
the
case
has
been
fully
briefed.
it's
now
being
argued
before
this
court.
and
that
statute
cuts
only
one
way.
it
simply
strengthens
the
case
for
reversal.
there
is,
what
is
more,
an
urgency
in
the
matter.
one
of
the
petitioners...
the
petitioner
has
spent
some
$10
million
in
developing
plans
for
a
plant.
that
process
has
been
stopped.
there
is
a
federal
commitment,
a
national
commitment
to
the
construction
of
further
plants.
and
putting
those
various
considerations
together,
it
seems
to
us
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
remand.
now,
the
relevance
of
that
statute
is
that
it
reaffirms
the
federal
responsibility
and
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
this
discrete
question
of
storage
and
disposal
of
nuclear
waste.
some
63
pages
of
that
statute
are
devoted
to
no
other
subject.
what
is
more,
it
indicates
a
congressional
view,
endorsing
the
view
of
the
federal
regulatory
commission,
that
plants
will
not
shut
down,
as
california
fears
or
pretends
to
fear,
because
of
the
storage
or
disposal
problem.
congress
has
provided
that
in
case
there
is
a
storage
problem,
there
will
be
a
federal
facility
to
take
the
excess.
it
has
furthermore
provided
through
procedures
which
are
lengthy,
in
which
the
states
are
fully
consulted,
that
there
will
be
a
final
disposal
solution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
stevens,
in
the
meantime
they
must
wait
because
they
cannot
proceed
further
without
certification
from
the
california
commission
which
is
not
permitted
under
its
law
to
give
that
certificate
until
not
merely
congress
has
indicated
that
the
problem
will
be
solved,
but
that
the
problem
has
been
solved.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
that
the
federal
commission
has
approved
that
solution,
and
indeed
that
a
site
has
been
selected.
and
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
those
procedures
are
ten
years
or
seven
years
in
the
future.
and
in
the
meantime,
california
has
said
nothing
further
may
occur.
that
delay
is
substantial.
leaving
the
new
statute
aside
and
concentrating
on
the
federal
laws
that,
in
our
view,
at
all
events
control
this
case
so
as
to
require
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
below,
we
wish
to
stress
that
what
is
present
here
are
two
sorts
of
conflicts.
one
is
an
actual
present
conflict
between
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
through
its
nuclear
commission
and
the
laws
of
california.
that
is
most
obviously
illustrated
in
that
the
federal
commission
continues
to
license
nuclear
power
plants,
notwithstanding
that
there
is
as
yet
no
federally-approved
final
disposal
solution,
whereas
california
says
we
disagree.
we
will
not
allow
any
plant
to
be
certified
or
built
in
california
until
such
time
as
a
federally-approved
waste
disposal
system
is
found.
and
what
is
more,
our
legislature
is
satisfied
with
that
solution.
there
is
another
sort
of
conflict,
equally
serious,
which
is
a
conflict
of
jurisdiction:
who
shall
decide
these
questions
of
storage
and
disposal?
california
says
we
will
determine,
our
commission
must
determine
whether
in
our
view
there
is
available
storage
space,
whereas
the
federal
commission
has
determined
to
license
plants
without
requiring
the
kind
of
storage
facility
that
california
leaves
itself
free
to
require.
if
any
area
appears
to
us
to
have
been
wholly
preempted...
and
this
is
most
evident
in
section
274(c)
of
the
'59
act...
it
is
the
area
of
construction,
design
and
disposal
of
waste.
california
is
permitted
under
that
'59
act,
like
any
other
state,
to
make
agreements
taking
over
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
commission
with
respect
to
fringe
areas
but
not
disposal
or
storage
of
high-level
nuclear
wastes.
california,
like
every
other
state,
is
permitted
by
section
274(l)
to
give
advice,
to
be
consulted
with
respect
to
these
matters
of
storage
and
disposal.
but
the
commission,
the
federal
commission
under
the
act
very
clearly
retains
its
jurisdiction,
its
responsibility
with
respect
to
storage
and
disposal,
as
is
made
clear
in
section
274(c).
now,
the
section
on
which
the
respondents
rely
and
on
which
the
court
below
relied
was
274(k),
an
inartfully
worded
provision
which
read
most
generously
might
be
read
to
suggest
that
california
can
regulate
any
activity
respecting
the
building
or
operation
of
a
nuclear
power
plant
so
long
as
it
does
it
with
a
motive
other
than
protection
against
radiation
hazards.
we
suggest
it
cannot
reasonably
be
read
that
way
in
light
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
which
i
have
sketched,
because
otherwise
it
would
mean
that
notwithstanding
the
federal
judgment
that
there
is
an
adequate
means
of
disposal
and
an
interim
storage
capability,
california
could
say
we
will
ban
all
plants,
not
for
fear
of
radiation
but
because
it's
aesthetically
displeasing
to
us,
it
will,
in
our
view,
endanger
the
environment
other
than
through
radiation--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--justice
o'connor,
california
has
not...
had
california
said
and
been
able
to
sustain
the
proposition
that
it
was,
in
effect,
for
the
time
being
banning
nuclear
plants
because
they
were
going
to
produce
rates
for
their
consumers
that
were
too
high,
there
would
be
no
quarrel
with
that.
that
is
the
authority
which
the
states
retain
over
the
sale
and
transmission
of
electrical
power,
and
they
may
do
that
with
respect
to
nuclear
plants
as
with
others.
and
they
may
determine
that
the
cost
of
the
electricity
will
simply
be
too
high.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
they've
done
something
quite
different.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
even--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
think
the
state
has
to
concede
that
since
the
moratorium
is
only
effective
until
such
time
as
a
federally-approved
disposal
system
is
in
existence,
they're
not
concerned
that
power
plants
per
se
produce
electricity
at
too
high
a
rate.
the
existence
of
the
disposal
system
isn't
going
to
change
the
cost
of
production.
they
are,
say
they,
concerned
that
the
plant
may
be
required
to
be
shut
down
and
that
the
reliance
on
that
electricity
may
put
their
citizens
at
risk.
that
fear
involves
a
second-guessing
of
the
federal
judgment
that
there
is
no
such
problem
of
ultimate
disposal,
and
that
fear
is
therefore
not
one
on
which
california
can
properly
halt
the
licensing
of
nuclear
plants.
and
in
this
respect
the
new
statute
is
of
special
relevance
because
it
says
at
the
federal
level
it
has
been
determined...
and
indeed
by
congress
itself...
that
this
problem
will
be
solved.
you
must,
therefore,
california,
put
that
out
of
mind
as
a
pretext
for
banning
nuclear
development
in
your
state.
we
completely
agree
that
if
california
were
to
say
we
need
no
electric
power
of
any
variety,
they
could
bar
nuclear
as
well
as
any
other
generating
facility.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
take
it
neither,
justice
stevens.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
so.
the
statute
does
go
on
to
say
"nor
shall
a
certificate
be
issued.
"
which
is--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--a
prerequisite
to
building
it.
