justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i...
you
mentioned
a
statute
that
was
recently
passed.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
would
that
be...
is
that
statute
arguably
dispositive
for
one
side
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
contrary
to
the...
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know.
but
it's--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
it's
contrary
to
their
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
it's
only
60-some
pages
long.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you...
i
take
it
if
the
state...
if
there's
an
application
to
the
state
commission
for
building
a
new
coal
plant--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
commission
says
sorry,
but
we
don't
need
any
more
power
plants
in
this
state,
the
fact
that
another
entity
comes
in
and
applies
for
a
state
permission
to
build
a
nuclear
plant,
even
though
it's
licensed
by
the
federal
authority,
the
state
could
still
keep
that
plant
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that...
and
you
say
that
that
kind...
you
say
that
that
kind
of
an
economic
decision
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
state's
statutes
are
safety
statutes
rather
than
economic
statutes,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
say
well,
we
think
the...
we
think
they
can
dispose
of
nuclear
waste
safely,
but
it's
going
to
cost
so
much
and
escalate
the
cost
of
electricity
so
much
that
we're
just
not
going
to
have
a
nuclear
plant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did...
did
they
do
more
than
that
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
mcdonough,
hasn't
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
the
california
law
and
said...
said
as
we
understand
this
law,
california
has
economic
concerns
about
nuclear
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
we
know
more
about
the
california
law
than
they
do,
or
must
we
act
like
we
do,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
last
case
i
have
to
announce
is
pacific
gas
&
electric
against
the
state
energy
commission
of
california.
under
--
under
the
california
law,
the
commission
before
it
issues
a
license
for
a
nuclear
energy
plant
must
determine
that
that
plant
will
have
adequate
storage
capacity
for
the
interim
storage
of
spent
fuel.
the
statute
also
imposes
a
moratorium
on
any
nuclear
plant
licensing
until
and
unless
the
federal
government
approves
a
technology
for
the
permanent
storage
of
high
level
of
nuclear
waste.
the
utilities
who
are
the
petitioners
in
this
case
filed
a
suit
claiming
that
these
provisions
were
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause
because
they
were
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law.
the
district
court
agreed
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
issue
about
relating
to
interim
storage
was
not
right
for
resolution,
but
it
went
to
hold
that
the
moratorium
was
valid
because
it
was
not
in
conflict
with
a
federal
law.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
affirm
in
all
aspects
with
the
reasons
we
have
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
--
with
the
clerk.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
interim
storage
provision
was
not
ripe
for
resolution
and
that
the
moratorium
is
it
either
conflicts
with
federal
law
and
it
doesn't
frustrate
any
objective
of
the
--
of
the
federal
law,
so
we
affirm
the
judgment.
justice
blackmun
joined
by
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
