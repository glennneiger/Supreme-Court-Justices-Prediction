mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
claiborne
says
that
the
1982
statute
cuts
only
one
way
in
this
case.
we
agree,
but
we
think
it
cuts
entirely
in
favor
of
affirmance,
though
not
terribly
strongly.
let
me
explain
why
that
is
when
i
discuss
it
in
the
context
of
the
remaining
federal
statutory
provisions.
we
think
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
quite
simple.
it
is
a
state's
authority
to
decline
the
nuclear
option
simply
as
too
uncertain,
too
costly,
to
discontinuous,
until
the
states
have
been
assured
by
actual
federal
resolution
and
not
simply
by
a
commitment
to
resolution,
assured
by
actual
federal
resolution
of
the
nuclear
waste,
storage
and
disposal
problem
that
their
current
fears
will
not
materialize.
such
state
authority
can
be
and
has
been
exercised
in
a
variety
of
forms:
by
statute
in
california,
connecticut,
maine
and
oregon;
by
referendum
in
massachusetts;
by
executive
order
in
new
york;
by
an
order
of
the
public
service
commission
in
wisconsin.
indeed,
similar
authority
is
quite
routinely
exercised
on
a
plant-by-plant
basis
in
arizona,
minnesota,
illinois,
a
couple
of
dozen
other
states.
on
the
basis
of
a
judgment
that
until
we
know
what
to
do
with
the
waste,
and
where
it
will
go,
and
how
much
it
will
cost
we
cannot
make
a
reasonable,
economically
sound
commitment
to
nuclear
power--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
could
probably
take
a
dozen
years,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
you
mean
how
long
until
a
nuclear
plant
that
they
seek
to
build?
but
the
point
is
they
don't
want
to
invest
billions
of
dollars
that
they
will
then
seek
to
recover
from
our
ratepayers,
leaving
them
holding
the
bag,
something
neither
they
nor
we
want,
until
they
have
some
assurance.
in
that
sense
there
is
a
convergence
of
position
between
the
respondents
and
petitioners.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
the
point
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
federal
concern
is,
as
you
say,
precisely
safety;
and
they
can
satisfy
federal
authorities
who
have
decided
that
while
the
search
for
a
storage
and
disposal
solution
goes
on,
it
may
be
safe
to
keep
licensing
plants.
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
say
that
the
questions
addressed
at
the
federal
and
state
levels
are
wholly
different.
the
reason
it
may
be
entirely
safe
to
keep
licensing
plants
even
when
we're
not
sure
whether
we
will
ever
find
adequate
storage
and
disposal
facilities
is
that
when
push
comes
to
shove,
one
can
always
order
them
shut
down.
that
is
indeed
what
the
environmental
protection
administration
warned
california
some
seven
months
before
these
laws
were
enacted.
now,
to
shut
down
is
safe,
but
it
leaves
us
with--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i'm
afraid,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
ghosts
will
haunt
the
people
of
california,
not
just
the
investors.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
through
higher
rates
that
are
forced
upon
them
for
substitute
electricity;
that
is,
if
it
were
really
assured
in
advance
somehow
that
only
the
shareholders
in
the
utilities
would
end
up
suffering
when
cost
interruptions...
when
service
interruptions
occur
when
shutdowns
are
ordered,
we'd
have
a
very
different
nuclear
industry
in
the
united
states.
it
is
precisely
because
investors
can
count
on
the
utility
commissions
to
pass
some
of
those
costs
on
that
the
situation
is
of
fundamental
concern
to
the
state
of
california.
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
of
course,
i
suppose
if
the
entire
system
of
california
were
restructured
so
that
it
were
made
bindingly
clear
in
advance
that
in
no
circumstances
would
costs
be
passed
on,
we'd
have
a
different
case
here.
but
in
that
case
i
doubt
that
the
petitioners...
who
have
not
made
this
argument;
it's
being
made
only
by
the
united
states...
i
doubt
then
that
the
utilities
would
have
any
real
interest
in
taking
these
enormous
risks.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
california
by
referendum,
as
massachusetts
could
do,
could
say
we're
waiting
until
the
problem
is
solved.
it
doesn't
really
want
to
take--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but...
i
suppose
it
could
prevent
by
referendum
at
this
point
from
passing
it
on,
but
then
when
they
confront
bankruptcy
and
come
back
to
ask
for
help,
we'd
face
a
different
situation.
it's
not
just
the
pass-on
of
costs
that's
a
problem.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
want
the
electricity.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
one
of
the
things
that
we
think
the
state
has
a
clear
right
to
do
is
wait
until
the
problem
is
solved
before
making
the
commitment.
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
that
if
these
utilities
invest
in
nuclear
power,
even
if
in
the
end
it's
a
bunch
of
california
shareholders
who
go
broke
rather
than
the
ratepayers
who
pay
too
much,
even
if
that
could
be
assured,
there
remains
the
problem
of
an
interruption
of
a
continuous
electrical
source.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
legislative
argument
was
resolved
by
the
legislature--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
a
way
we
think
they
had
a
right
to
resolve
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
not
at
all.
and
we
think
precisely
because
they
have
that
authority,
they
don't
need
the
help
of
the
federal
judiciary
in
finding
preemption
where
it
has
not
been
expressly
adopted.
in
the...
in
1982
congress
was
asked
to
preempt
the
field
quite
explicitly
through
something
called
the
mcclure
amendment,
which
would
have
said,
as
petitioners
and
the
united
states
seem
to
think
it
did
say,
that
we
have
in
fact
solved
the
waste
disposal
problem
or
are
certain
that
a
solution
will
be
available
on
time.
that
language
in
the
senate
version
which
was
passed
last
year,
and
similar
language
which
was
proposed
to
the
house
was
expressly
deleted.
and
representative
ottinger,
who
played
an
important
role
in
the
drafting
the
law,
said
it
was
deleted
to
avoid
preemption.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
certainly
they
haven't
and
shouldn't;
but
the
provisions
that
were
specifically
deleted
in
a
bill
of
this
kind
at
least
suggest
that
what
the
petitioners
asked
the
federal
judiciary
to
do
is
something
that
the
industry
has
repeatedly
asked
congress
to
do
and
congress
has
repeatedly
refused
to
do,
as
in
dames
and
moore
v.
reagan
and
in
other
such
cases.
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
significance
of
congressional
inaction
may
be
ambiguous,
but
in
this
case
it's
very
clear,
and
the
history
leaves
no
doubt,
that
congress
omitted
the
very
language
that
would
have
suggested
there
is
no
waste
disposal
problem.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
the
only
issue
before
them
was
preemption,
that
might
have
been
true;
but
the
thing
they
voted
against
was
a
measure
that
would
have
specifically
declared
the
waste
disposal
problem
is
solved,
and
any
legal
requirement
that
requires
its
solution
as
a
precondition
of
licensing
more
nuclear
plants
shall
be
deemed
satisfied.
that's,
of
course,
what
i
think
that
the
petitioners
and
the
united
states
want
to
make
out
of
this
act.
but
to
put
that
act
in
context,
all
it
does
is
say
that
there
shall
be
some
federal
backup
interim
storage
which
amounts
by
the
year
2000
to
about
3
percent
of
the
amount
of
storage
space
that
even
the
department
of
energy
says
will
be
needed.
and
then
it
says
we're
going
to
get
back
on
track
and
somehow
solve
the
problem
of
permanent
waste
disposal
by
perhaps
the
year
1990
or
so.
promising
it
will
be
solved
is
very
nice,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
places
that
we
could
go
off
track.
a
state
could
veto
it
under
this
bill,
could
veto
a
location
for
a
repository;
and
unless
congress
and
the
president
override
the
veto,
we're
back
to
ground
zero.
and
in
any
event,
you
cannot
mandate
by
law
the
solution
to
a
technological
problem.
california
says
until
you
solve
that
technological
problem,
this
is
too
risky
a
gamble
for
us.
and
i
thought
it
was--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
would
think
once
the
jurisdictional
dispute
between
the
faa
and
the
nrc
had
been
resolved,
the
state
would
probably
be
out
of
luck,
because
the
safety
of
an
atomic-powered
airplane
would
not
be
up
to
california
to
judge.
but
if
california
says
we
don't
want
our
utilities
or
our
chartered
entities,
if
you
can
imagine
a
special
industry
of
this
kind,
to
invest
lots
of
money
that
may
have
to
come
from
california
pockets
in
that
kind
of
airplane
until
they've
built
some
airports
for
it
so
that
we
know
where
it
can
land,
that
would
be
a
reasonable
economic
judgment
california
could
make.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
the
military
area
california
makes
no
claim
whatever.
the
claim
here
is
that
with
respect
to
the
degree
to
which
a
state
must
depend
on
nuclear
power
to
meet
its
energy
needs,
that
at
no
point
has
congress
ever
decided
or
the
nrc
ever
decided
that
that
is
a
judgment
for
the
federal
government
to
make.
it's
always
been
a
judgment
for
the
state.
one
can't
put
need
and
cost
in
neat
little
compartments
as
though
they
were
not
affected
by
those
things
that
might
require
the
plants
to
shut
down.
and
the
statements
that
are
made
by
the
petitioners
and
by
the
united
states
i
think
are
profoundly
misleading
in
this
respect.
congress,
they
say,
is
willing
to
license
the
plants
by
betting
on
the
future,
even
though
there
may
be
risk
of
some
shutdown.
they
don't
take
that
risk
so
seriously.
therefore,
they
say,
for
the
state
of
california
to
have
a
different
judgment
is
wrong.
the
mistake
there
is
that
congress'
willingness
to
license
the
plants
while
searching
for
a
solution
represents
nothing
more
than
a
belief
that
the
mandate
of
the
atomic
energy
act
to
provide
a
safe
nuclear
option
can
be
met
even
before
we've
discovered
what
to
do
with
the
waste.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
in
1973
the
federal
government's
concern
might
have
been
that
we
need
to
have
less
dependence
on
oil,
more
dependence
on
nuclear
power;
and
therefore,
we
might
enact
a
law
saying
that
those
who
own
utilities
have
got
to
put
nuclear
power
on
the
shelf.
notice,
congress
didn't
pass
such
a
law.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
didn't
pass
such
a
law
because
those
who
own
nuclear...
those
who
own
electricity-generating
utilities,
whether
they
are
private
companies
or
whether
they
are
municipalities
or
states,
are
left
entirely
free,
even
under
their
interpretation
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
to
say
this
is
a
bad
investment.
it
is
only
when
there
is
a
separation
between
those
who
regulate
and
those
who
own,
on
the
theory
of
the
petitioners,
that
there
is
some
sudden
mandate
to
go
nuclear.
now,
that
makes
no
sense
in
terms
of
independence
of
oil,
in
terms
of
any
other
coherent
federal
policy.
if
the
federal
government
wanted
to
make
a
decision
that
we
really
have
to
choose
at
least
20
percent
of
our
energy
sources
from
nuclear,
congress
would
not
be
without
means
of
legislating
such
a
choice.
but
the
most
consistent
pattern
in
the
entire
history
of
legislation
in
this
area
is
that
the
choice
of
technology
in
light
of
risks
of
shutdown,
risks
of
interruption,
cost
uncertainties,
and
other
factors
has
been
left
to
the
states.
indeed,
the
comparison
with
hydroelectric
power,
in
response
to
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
is
quite
instructive,
because
when
the
atomic
energy
act
in
1954
was
debated
and
passed,
senator
humphrey
proposed
that
the
atomic
energy
commission's
control
over
nuclear
power
be
as
comprehensive,
as
pervasive
as
the
fpc's
control
over
hydroelectric
power;
that
it
should
be
treated
as
a
national
resource
to
be
dealt
with
in
terms
of
foreign
policy
and
other
concerns.
that
proposal
was
debated.
it
was
opposed
by
senator
hickenlooper
on
the
specific
ground
that
it
would
be
a
federal
usurpation
of
state
sovereignty
to
give
the
atomic
energy
commission
that
broad
a
role.
and
it
was
replaced
by
the
much
narrower
role
of
federal
regulation
of
radiation
hazards,
which,
of
course,
california
does
not
challenge.
indeed,
all
california
asserts
here
is
not
the
right--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
that
was
the
'54
act.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there
are
two
steps,
justice
rehnquist.
in
1954
there
was
a
decision
to
end
the
federal
monopoly
over
nuclear
materials,
but
there
was
a
very
close
federal
control
over
those
in
the
private
sector
who
would
use
them.
the
states
were
given
no
special
role
except
that
their
preexisting
role
of
regulating
the
generation
of
electricity
was
kept
intact
in
section
271.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
then
in
1954
neither
the
states
nor
the
federal
government
were
regulating
nuclear
power
plants
because
there
were
none.
the
first
prototype
was
built
in
1957.
but
the
point
was
it
was
anticipated,
hoped
that
there
would
be
a
nuclear
power
industry,
and
the
attempt
to
structure
that
industry
by
federal
law
was
rejected.
instead
it
was
said
that
the
regulatory
structure
in
place
for
generating
electricity
would
be
the
available
one,
except
that
the
federal
government--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--except
in
the
'54
statute
after
the
debate
about
the
role
of
the
states
in
the
federal
government,
the
language
of
section
271
was
adopted
saying
that
"nothing
in
the
act
shall
be
construed
to
affect
the
authority
or
regulations
of
any
state
with
respect
to
the
generation,
sale
or
transmission
of
electrical
power
produced
through
federally-licensed
nuclear
facilities.
"
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
correct.
that's
'54.
section
271.
now,
in
1959
the
decision
was
made
that
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
then
the
aec,
could
relinquish
some
of
its
power
over
radioactive
materials
under
agreements
with
the
states,
but
not
all
of
its
power.
that
is,
there
was
a
reservation
in
section
274(c)
of
the
nrc's
power
to
protect
the
public
from
radiation
hazards
from
certain
activities,
particularly
the
operation
of
nuclear
power
plants
and
the
disposal
of
their
waste.
but
even
that
had
an
exception,
and
that
is
the
section
that
you
may
be
thinking
about,
justice
rehnquist,
in
section
274(k).
that
is,
section
274(k)
said
that
even
as
to
nuclear
plant
and
waste
regulation...
that
is,
even
as
to
those
activities
over
which
the
nrc
could
not
relinquish
its
authority...
the
states
would
remain
free
to
regulate
"for
purposes
other
than
protection
against
radiation
hazards.
"
so
there
are--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
no.
we...
we--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
think
that
as
far--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
marshall.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
is,
we
trust...
the
reason...
we
do
trust
their
expertise.
we
trust
they'll
know
when
to
shut
the
plants
down.
but
when
the
plants
are
shut
down,
that
solution
to
the
safety
problem
because
the
cause
of
our
cost
and
continuity
problem.
and
in
particular,
it
is
because
of
the
sharing
of
expertise,
the
federal
government
over
radiation--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--with
california--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
sharing.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
says
no
because
it
costs
too
much.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
when
they
can
come
up
with
a
solution,
we're
happy
to
have
them
give
us
a
safe
one.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
the
best
we
can
do,
justice
marshall.
and
essentially
what
we
are
doing
is
avoiding
the
creation
of
what
would
be
quite
an
astonishing
regulatory
vacuum.
the
one
thing
that
has
not
been
denied
by
the
petitioners
or
the
united
states
is
that
the
nrc's
mandate
is
quite
narrow.
it
is
to
figure
out
how
best
to
preserve
the
national
security
and
the
public
health
and
safety
from
radiation
hazards
from
these
nuclear
plants
and
their
wastes.
that
does
not
include
the
question
of
how
best
to
meet
the
states'
energy
needs,
whether
this
stuff
is
too
costly
and
too
uncertain.
i
think
it's
interesting
that
the
amicus
briefs
of
connecticut
and
oregon
point
out
to
this
court
that
some
nine
months
ago
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
repealed
its
financial
qualification
requirements
for
nuclear
power
plant
operators
on
the
ground
that
economics
was
a
matter
for
the
states
to
worry
about.
and
the
nrc
in
doing
so
specifically
said
that
nuclear
plant
shutdowns
need
not
concern
the
federal
government
since
they
are
"not
inimical
to
public
health
and
safety
under
the
atomic
energy
act.
"
of
course
they're
not
inimical
to
health
and
safety.
this
is
not
a
safety
measure.
but
they
are
inimical
to
continuity
of
service,
and
unless
we
recreate
a
different
world
for
sharing
costs,
they're
inimical
to
the
pocketbooks
of
the
ratepayers.
in
these
circumstances
it
seems
to
us
quite
plain
that
the
federal
judiciary
could
not
really
grant
to
petitioners
the
judgment
that
they
seek
here
without
very
substantially
expanding
the
power
of
federal
courts,
not
only
at
the
expense
of
the
state
legislatures,
but
at
the
expense
of
congress
itself;
for
congress
repeatedly
has
been
confronted
with
the
request
to
occupy
this
territory,
to
take
it
over,
and
its
rejection
of
that
request,
whatever
we
may
usually
make
of
congressional
inaction,
is
significant
here
because
the
effect
of
a
victory
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
be
to
transfer
to
the
federal
government
the
entire
question
of
deciding
whether
nuclear
power
is
as
suitable
a
way
of
meeting
a
state's
energy
needs
as
coal
or
oil
might
be.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
think
the
supremacy
clause
means
that
we
cannot
conflict
in
any
way
with
what
the
nrc
does.
we
couldn't
tell
a
nuclear
plant
that
we
think
a
safer
way
of
operating
is
to
run
x
hours
a
day,
whereas
the
nrc
has
concluded,
given
problems
of
human
fatigue,
that
it's
x
plus
5
hours
a
day.
that's
not
our
point.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
what...
what
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--oh,
i...
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that,
justice
marshall.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
if
our
views
were
to
prevail
completely,
then
the
motive
would
be
irrelevant,
for
this
reason:
under
section
271
of
the
atomic
energy
act
passed
in
1954,
as
long
as
a
state
exercises
its
historic,
traditional
power...
and
we
think
the
power
to
say
no
to
a
proposed
electric
generating
facility
falls
in
that
category...
as
long
as
it
is
not
regulating
the
ongoing
operation
of
a
nuclear
facility,
then
there's
no
preemption
at
all
and
motive
doesn't
matter.
it
is
only
if
we
lose
that
claim
and
only
if
we
must
rely
on
section
274(k)...
that
is,
if
the
court
treats
what
california
has
done
as
a
regulation
of
the
operation
of
nuclear
power
plants
or
their
wastes,
only
then
we
must
show
that
we
come
within
274(k),
namely
that
this
is
for
purposes
other
than
radiation.
and
as
to
that
i
think
that
the
case
that
i
lost
in
the
crawford
case
really
reflects
the
court's
fairly
general
sense
that
second-guessing
the
motives
of
lawmakers
is
a
very
difficult
thing.
but
if
we
lose
our
claim
under
271,
there'd
be
no
choice
other
than
to
second
guess.
however,
this
court
would
hardly
be
the
tribunal
to
do
it.
the
ninth
circuit
has
already
said
that
the
purposes
were
economic.
the
district
court
made
no
contrary
finding.
the
record
contains
not
a
shred
of
contrary
evidence.
that
is,
the
focus
of
the
legislature
in
california
at
this
time
was
on
several
alternative
ways
of
dealing
with
the
nuclear
problem.
one
rather
more
extreme
approach
was
concerned
with
safety,
and
that
was
rejected
by
the
people
ultimately.
the
other
approach
focused,
as
the
legislative
committee
that
proposed
it
stressed
in
its
reassessment
report,
focused
on
problems
of
cost
and
reliability,
not
safety.
so
that
if
we
do
have
to
rely
on
section
274(k),
then
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
this
is
a
properly
motivated
law.
one
of
the
reasons
i
don't
want
to
have
to
rely
on
274(k)
is
that
i
think
for
institutional
reasons
it
makes
a
great
deal
more
sense
to
create
a
rather
clean
division
between
those
kinds
of
activities
that
states
are
preempted
from
and
cannot
engage
in
under
the
atomic
energy
act
and
those
kinds
that
are
somehow
suspect.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
classic
example
of
a
nonproblematic
state
decision
is
a
state
decision
simply
not
to
have
a
particular
form
of
power.
it
is
only
when
the
states
undertake
to
regulate
in
detail
how
that
power
will
be
produced
that
there
could
be
ongoing
conflicts
between
what
the
states
think
is
appropriate
and
what
the
federal
regulators
think
is
appropriate.
it's
only
then
that
we
get
into
this
twilight
zone
of
motive.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i'm
glad
we
don't
have
to
defend
that
view,
but
that
is
my
view.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's
my
view
that
the
atomic
energy
act
basically
puts
nuclear
power
on
the
shelf.
it
says
it's
the
exclusive
responsibility
of
the
nrc
to
decide
how
those
who
buy
it
are
to
use
it
so
that
it
will
be
safe,
but
it
is
not
a
federal
decision
whether
it
is
appropriate,
whether
it
is
needed,
whether
it
is
expensive,
and
indeed,
if
someone
says
we
just
don't
want
to
take
the
risks,
all
of
the
risks,
taken
as
a
whole.
we
believe
nothing
in
the
atomic
energy
act
precludes
that
kind
of
action.
of
course,
this
case,
it's
important,
i
think,
to
stress,
does
not
require
the
court
to
go
nearly
so
far,
because
the
record
in
this
case
is
unambiguous
that
california
was
not
trying
in
some
way
to
protect
its
people
from
radiation
hazards.
these
wastes
that
we
are
worrying
about,
the
record
makes
clear,
these
wastes
are
not
at
the
moment
targeted
in
some
way
for
california.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
suggesting
that
california
was
afraid
that
the
permanent
waste
depository
would
be
located
there,
that
they
might
try
to
veto
it
and
fail.
the
concern
was
entirely
what
happens
to
the
consumers,
the
ratepayers,
the
energy
users
of
california
if
all
of
the
optimism
of
the
nuclear
industry
and
the
federal
regulators
turns
out
to
have
proved
somewhat
overblown,
and
if
one
actually
has
to
shut
the
plants
down
to
protect
the
people.
and
it
is
at
that
point
that
california
exercises
the
kind
of
traditional
judgment
that
we
do
not
think
involves
a
regulation
of
nuclear
power
plants,
and
therefore
doesn't
raise
the
motive
issue.
now,
arguably
there's
a
problem
in
that
respect
with
respect
to
one
provision
that
i
think
is
particularly
unripe
for
resolution
here;
and
that
is
the
provision
dealing
with
full
core
onsite
reserve
capacity,
so
that
when
a
reactor
is
shut
down
for
repairs
you
don't
have
to
ship
its
active
core
miles
away
during
the
repair
process
but
can
store
the
core
at
the
site
of
the
plant.
now,
one
could
say
that
that
is
an
attempt
by
the
state
of
california
to
dictate
some
detail
of
nuclear
power
plant
construction,
and
that
to
prevail
on
that
claim
we
really
do
have
to
show
that
the
motive
under
274(k)
is
other
than
radiation
control.
even
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
in
that
case
we
would
have
to
rely
on
274(k),
this
is
a
provision
as
to
which
all
parties
seem
agreed,
that
the
reason
has
nothing
to
do
with
safety,
the
reason
for
requiring
that
the
core
not
have
to
get
shipped
miles
away.
the
reason,
quite
simply...
and
the
solicitor
general
says
so
in
his
brief;
petitioners
say
so
in
their
brief...
the
reason
is
that
when
you
have
to
ship
the
core
away,
you
close
the
plant
down
longer,
you
have
a
longer
interruption,
and
it
costs
more.
so
even
as
to
that
provision
i
think
we
prevail.
but
i
say
that
that
provision
is
unripe,
and
that,
i
think,
is
a
point
on
which
i
might
close.
i
want
the
court
to
recognize
that
the
provisions
dealing
with
interim
storage,
as
to
which
the
1982
act
provides
some
marginal
degree
of
help,
do
not
even
become
effective
in
california
unless
and
until
the
nuclear
waste
disposal
moratorium
ends.
until
the
moratorium
ends,
the
storage
law
has
no
operation
whatever.
and
we
do
think,
therefore,
it's
unripe
for
decision.
as
to
the
waste
disposal
law,
although
the
ninth
circuit
in
ruling
in
our
favor
found
it
ripe
for
decision,
i
think
justice
rehnquist's
analogy
of
the
christmas
tree
lights
strung
in
parallel
really
was
perfect.
the
point
that
the
petitioners
themselves
have
made...
they
didn't
have
to,
but
they've
said
it...
is
that
it
would
really
not
help
them
at
all
to
have
the
waste
disposal
law
struck
down.
it
wouldn't
help
them
at
all
because,
they
say
in
their
petition
for
certiorari,
that
no
rational
utility
would
enter
the
bramble
bush,
the
thicket,
whatever
their
image,
of
california
certification
law
unless
they
were
assured
that
the
whole
thing
was
blown
up.
but
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
plain
that
nothing
that
could
possibly
be
derived
from
this
court's
preemption
decisions
could
warrant
completely
ousting
the
states
from
a
regulatory
role
with
respect
to
electricity
simply
because
the
fuel
that's
used
is
nuclear.
and
unless
the
court
went
that
far,
i
think
it's
clear
from
their
own
concession
that
they
would
not
be
benefited.
but
if
the
court
does
reach
the
merits,
then
i
think
it
important
to
close
by
saying
that
california
deeply
shares
the
concern
expressed
in
this
court
by
over
30
states
that
a
ruling
for
the
utilities
would
leave
a
vital
sphere
of
traditional
state
regulation
over
electricity
in
a
state
of
complete
disarray,
creating
a
regulatory
vacuum
that
congress
has
not
filled
even
during
the
1973
oil
crisis,
and
at
the
same
time
would
quite
radically
shift
power
to
the
federal
judiciary,
power
that
the
states
have
relied
on
the
congress
to
exercise.
thank
you.
