and
development
commission.
mr.
mcdonough,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
position
is
that
you
don't
need
that
statute
at
all,
i
take
it.

how
long
will
it
be
before
a
plant
of
this
kind
in
this
situation
could
be
completed
after
the
certificate
is
issued?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
isn't...
doesn't
that
allow
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
resolve
some
of
these
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
they
thought...
if
the
petitioners
here
can't
satisfy
the
federal
regulatory
authority
on
the
safety,
they'll
never
have
a
plant
in
operation,
will
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
the
worst
that
could
happen...
isn't
the
worst
that
could
happen
for
the
investors
of
the...
in
this
kind
of
an
enterprise
that
they
might
have
a
lot
of
ghost
plants
on
their
hands
if
they
can't
satisfy
the
safety
requirements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
the
people
pay
for
this
plant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
a...
what
if
a
state
attempted
to
pass
a
statute
that...
let's
assume
some
newer
development
in
air
travel
along
the
lines
of
the
three-hour
planes
to
london
and
paris,
but
that
they
were
thought
to
be
of
uncertain
safety.
could
a
state
say
none
of
these
planes
can
pass
over
our
state
until
you're
absolutely
sure
that
none
of
them
will
ever
fall?
let's
assume
it's
an
atomic-powered
airplane.
that
might
give
us
an
analogy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we've
already
got
that
with
reference
to
atomic-powered
ships,
including
submarines,
have
we
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
mcdonough,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,--
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you,
