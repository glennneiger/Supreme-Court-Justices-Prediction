justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
mr.
mcdonough,
if
the
statute
had
not
been
enacted,
you'd
still
be
here,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
rely
then
only
on
the
'54
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
they
say,
mr.
mcdonough,
no,
maybe
we
could
use
one,
maybe
we
need
one,
but
this
is
just
going
to
cost
too
much,
and
the
possible
burden
on
the
state's
economy
is
so
great
that
we'll
not
allow
that
plant
to
be
built?
