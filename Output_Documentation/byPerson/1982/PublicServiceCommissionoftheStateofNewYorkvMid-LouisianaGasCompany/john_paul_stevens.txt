justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that
interpretation,
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
if
the
pipeline
had
a
subsidiary
instead
of
a
single
corporate
entity
that
transferred
from
its
wholly-owned
production
subsidiary
to
its
transmission
subsidiary,
that
you
would
regard
that
as
a
sale?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless
they
do
exactly
the
same
bookkeeping
for
a
division.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wouldn't
it
be
possible
to
organize
a
division
so
that
economically
it
was
the
exact
equivalent
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
can
understand
the
statutory
difference,
but
as
a
matter
of
economics
or
ordinary
business
and
investment
and
all
the
rest,
why
couldn't
you
have
your
division
doing
the
same
kind
of
operating
that
a
subsidiary
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
the
statutory
language
is
so
clear
that
if
the
commission
had
adopted
the
same
construction
as
the
fifth
circuit
had
adopted
that
would
have
been
impermissible--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
you
would
say
that
the
commission
rationally
could
have
read
it
either
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
right
there.
their
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
your
risks
of
exploration
and
the
rest
have
already
been
recouped
through
the
cost-of-service
pricing
which
was
different
than
the
others
had
so
that
they
are
different.
are
they
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
confine
yourself
to
the
period
in
which
there
was
cost-of-service
pricing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
wait
a
minute.
go
through
that
again.
assume
it
was
inadequate,
was
it
nevertheless
different
from
other
production...
a
different
system
of
pricing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
take
a
totally
independent
producer--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
as
i
understand
you,
the
pipeline
affiliates
were
on
cost-of-service
pricing
before
the
new
statute
was
passed.
and
independent
producers
were
on
an
area
wide
pricing,
and
you
say
well
there
really
isn't
much
difference
because
the
same
elements
went
into
the
calculation
of
the
area
wide
pricing.
were
the
price
levels
generally
about
the
same
or
was
there
a
material
difference
between
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
typical
was
that
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
their
wellhead
sales,
but
insofar
as
a
pipeline
affiliate
production
went
into
the
pipeline
transmission
system,
was
that
priced
on
a
cost-of-service
basis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
not,
so
the
two
of
you
disagree--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well
this
is
quite
important
to
me
because
it's
a
rather
dramatic
difference
between
what
the
court
is
being
told
by
the
two
adversaries
here.
you're
a
hundred
percent
sure
you're
right
on
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
understand,
though,
the
wellheads--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no
it's...
your
whole
argument
is
that
all
they
want
to
do
is
overrule
phillips.
and
if,
to
the
extent
that
he's
right
on
what
he's
represented
to
the
court,
that's
a
big
hole
in
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
that
was
cost-of-service
pricing
for
this
body
of
production,
however
significant
it
may
be,
the
commission
has
changed
and
maybe
that's
because
the
statutory
language
is
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this
one
question.
if
your
opponent
were
right
about
the
affiliate
gas,
and
then
by
the
definition
of
sale,
congress
did
say
something
as
to
that
gas,
because
clearly
there
is
a
sale
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
when
a
sale
from
a
subsidiary
to
the
parent.
and
it
did
say
something
if
he
is
right
on
his--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
would
be
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
probably
explain
why
the
commission
now
draws
that
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1978,
congress
enacted
a
statute
called
natural
gas
policy
act
which
comprehensively
changed
the
method
of
pricing
natural
gas
produced
in
the
united
states.
two
years
later,
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
promulgated
an
order
which
in
effect
provided
that
gas
produced
by
pipelines,
by
wells
owned
by
pipelines
would
for
the
most
part,
not
get
the
benefit
of
the
new
pricing
procedures
authorized
by
the
statute.
the
pipelines
challenged
the
order
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
cover
production
throughout
the
country
whether
by
pipelines
or
independently
owned
wells
or
whatever
the
ownership
of
the
well
might
be.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
include
pipeline
production
and
invalidated
the
order
in
question.
and
the
government
appealed
or
rather
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
and
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
this
question.
we
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit
and
hold
that
the
statute
does
include
for
sale
pricing
by
pipeline
who
produce
gas
as
well
as
others
and
therefore,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he's
joined
by
justice
brennan,
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun.
