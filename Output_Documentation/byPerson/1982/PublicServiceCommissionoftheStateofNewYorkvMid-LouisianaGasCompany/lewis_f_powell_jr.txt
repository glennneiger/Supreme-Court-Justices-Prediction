justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
your
submission
that
an
interstate
pipeline
company
that
also
produces
gas
but
does
not
do
so
through
a
subsidiary
is
not
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
act
of
'78.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
there's
never
a
first
sale--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--but,
is
the
purpose
of
the
acts
served
by
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
follow
that
up
a
little
bit?
if
25
percent
of
all
the
natural
gas
in
the
united
states
were
produced
by
interstate
pipeline
companies,
would
you
take
a
different
view?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
it
were
sold
the
same
way
as
the
gas
before
the
bill--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--but
would
it
not...
would
it
not
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
extent
to
which
gas
is
produced
in
the
united
states?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
the
country
has
a
shortage
of
natural
gas,
it
seems
to
me,
your
position
is
awfully
technical.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
awfully
technical.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
they
had
a
contract--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--or
whether
or
not
you
have
a
subsidiary.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--may
i
ask
this
question?
in
the
conversation
about
windfall
and
about
increased
costs
of
gas,
did
not
congress
contemplate
that
there
would
be
an
increase
in
the
cost
of
gas
as
a
result
of
the
1978
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
at
least
initially,
the
theory
was
that
over
time
as
more
gas
was
produced,
the
economics
of
it
would
bring
the
price
back
down.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
about
affiliates?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
apart
from
everything
else
our
duty,
as
you
suggested
at
the
outset,
is
to
construe
the
language
of
the
act
and
its
legislative
history
to
ascertain
congressional
intent.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
without
regard
to
who
loses
what
where.
