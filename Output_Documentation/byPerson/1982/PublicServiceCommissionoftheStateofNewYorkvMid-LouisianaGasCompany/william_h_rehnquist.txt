justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mckinney,
where
in
the
briefs
do
we
find
these
sections
that
you're
quoting?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
page
two
and
three
of
the
government's
briefs
is
where
it
should
be.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mckinney,
your
argument
seems
to
have
concentrated,
just
as
i
believed
mr.
feit's
did,
on
this
section
of
the
act
that
defines
first
sale,
and
i
realize
the
court
of
appeals
concentrated
on
that
too.
how
does
the
first
sale
definition
tie
in
to
the
other
operative
sections
of
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
practical
consequence
of
the
commission's
definition
of
first
sale?
i
mean,
what
does
that
enable
it
to
do
or
prohibit
it
from
doing
that
it
couldn't
have
otherwise
done?
what
other
sections
of
the
act
are
involved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
has
the
commission
done
insofar
as
regulating
or
not
regulating
by
virtue
of
its
definition
of
first
sale,
particularly
the
one
that's
in
contest
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
is
that
hurting
your
clients?
