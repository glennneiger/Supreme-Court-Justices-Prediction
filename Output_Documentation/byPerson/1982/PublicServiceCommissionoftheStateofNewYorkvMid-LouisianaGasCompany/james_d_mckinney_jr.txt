mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
far
less
complicated
than
mr.
feit
would
suggest.
simply
stated,
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
congress
intended
to
include
or
to
exclude
natural
gas
produced
by
pipelines
and
distribution
companies
from
the
coverage
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978.
now,
mr.
feit
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument
talking
about
the
natural
gas
act
of
1938,
and
that
just
isn't
relevant
to
this
proceeding.
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
interpreting
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
this
court
itself
on
january
4th
of
this
year
found,
in
the
energy
reserves
case,
that
for
gas
sold
in
the
interstate
market
the
natural
gas
policy
act
replaced
the
federal
price
controls
that
had
been
established
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now
petitioners
argue
that
the
congress
generally
intended
to
exclude
the
production
by
pipelines
and
distributors
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
disagreed.
it
found
that
the
deference
that's
normally
viewed,
agency
determination,
could
not
justify
an
interpretation
that
was
contrary
to
the
plain
meaning
and
the
purposes
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
and
there
is
no
basis
whatever
for
disturbing
that
decision.
in
support
of
their
position,
the
petitioners
argue
that
congress
generally
could
not
have
intended
to
include
pipeline
production
because
this
would
be
inconsistent
with
commission
cost-of-service
regulation
for
certain
periods
when
the
commission
regulated
production
under
the
natural
gas
act.
they
also
argue
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred,
therefore,
in
not
deferring
to
their
interpretation
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
create
a
substantial
reworking
of
state
and
federal
regulatory
schemes
and
that
the
pipelines
would
reap
a
windfall.
now,
in
examining
these
arguments,
the
starting
point
is
not
the
natural
gas
act
of
1938.
the
starting
point
is
to
recognize
the
reasons
leading
to
the
passage
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
the
structure
of
the
pricing
provisions
that
congress
created
to
deal
with
the
problem
it
was
confronted
with
in
1978.
the
act
was
passed
because
of
shortages
that
had
developed
in
the
interstate
market
in
the
1970's
that
had
resulted
from
commission
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act.
it
had
two
fundamental
purposes.
the
first
purpose
was
to
eliminate
the
disparity
between
the
interstate
and
the
intrastate
markets.
and
the
second
purpose
was
to
provide
incentive
prices
to
encourage
production.
to
accomplish
this
the
act
establishes
a
comprehensive
pricing
structure
applicable
to
all
categories
of
natural
gas
production.
each
of
those
pricing
categories
of
gas
production
applies
to
any
first
sale
of
gas.
therefore,
the
definition
of
first
sale
in
section
2(21)
is
very
important,
and
that
definition
defines
first
sale
broadly
to
mean
any
sale
of
any
volume
of
natural
gas.
by
this
broad
definition,
congress
plainly
intended
that
the
pricing
structure
of
the
act
would
apply
to
all
gas
production
sold
in
interstate
or
intrastate
commerce.
however,
without
any
further
qualification,
the
ceiling
prices
would
have
applied
to
all
downstream
sales
by
pipelines
where
they
were
reselling
gas
that
they
had
purchased
by...
from
others.
now
to
avoid
this,
subsection
b
of
section
2(21)--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--they
are...
throughout
the
briefs
you
will
find
the...
section
2(21).
it's--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--it's
at
page
two
of
the
brief
of
the
mid-law
respondents.
now
in
subsection
b
of
the
definition...
this
subsection
generally
provides
that
sales
by
pipelines
are
indeed
not
included
within
the
first
sale
definition.
and
if
congress
had
wanted
to
exclude
pipeline
production
from
the
price
ceilings
of
the
act,
if
could
have
stopped
right
there.
but
congress
knew
that
while
pipelines
function
primarily
as
resellers
they
also
produce
their
own
natural
gas
for
sale
by
their
systems.
and
in
this
respect
they
perform
the
same
service
as
any
other
producer
and
should
be
subject
to
the
incentives
and
ceilings
of
the
title
i
pricing
structure.
congress
therefore
added
a
critically
important
provision.
congress
said
that
a
pipeline
or
distribution
company
sale
is
excluded
unless...
unless
such
sale
is
attributable
to
volumes
of
natural
gas
produced
by
such
interstate
pipeline,
intrastate
pipeline,
or
local
distribution
company
or
any
other
affiliate
thereof.
now
this
language
on
its
face
plainly
is
intended
to
provide
that
natural
gas
produced
by
pipeline
companies
should
be
subject
to
the
price
ceilings
of
the
act
and
that
the
pricing
structure
of
the
act
apply
to
volumes
attributable
to
gas
produced
by
the
pipeline.
it
doesn't
go
on
to
say,
but
only
to
the
extent
the
ferc
in
its
discretion
permits,
or
any
other
limiting
language.
petitioner's
interpretation
simply
would
leave...
would
read
the
unless
cause
of
the
act.
now
petitioners
argue
however
that
their
interpretation
would
still
leave
some
meaning
to
the
unless
clause
while
they
acknowledge
that
pipeline
production
would
be
excluded
from
the
acts
coverage.
they
argued
that
certain
sales
by
the
pipelines
into
their
systems
other
than
their...
into
other
systems
than
their
own,
would
still
be
covered.
now
the
interpretation
is
based
on
the
following
reasoning,
that
the
intracorporate
transfer
of
gas
from
a
pipeline's
producing
properties
is
not
a
first
sale
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
and
secondly,
that
the
downstream
sale
of
the
gas
produced
by
the
pipeline
is
mixed
with
other
gas
purchased
by
the
pipeline
and
that
the
sale
of
those
volumes
is
not
exclusively
comprised
of
the
pipeline's
production,
words
the
petitioners
would
add
to
the
act.
however,
neither
of
these
arguments
is
supportable
in
any
way.
the
basic
rationale
that
petitioners
give
for
their
positions
is
that
their
interpretation
would
give
meaning
to
past
commission
regulation
of
certain
pipeline
production
on
a
cost-of-service
basis.
that
is
it,
the
entire
rationale
they
rely
upon.
now
first
of
all,
this
rationale
is
not
supported
even
by
the
nature
of
past
commission
regulation
itself.
cost-of-service
regulation
hadn't
been
applied
to
pipeline
production
or
to
pipeline
affiliate
production
from
leases
acquired
after
1969
or
to
any
production
developed
since
1973.
and
the
reason
that
the
commission
had
abandoned
cost-of-service
regulation,
had
abandoned
that
methodology
because
it,
itself,
had
found
that
the
methodology
had
been
a
failure
in
encouraging
the
pipelines
to
produce
their
own
gas.
it
made
that
finding
in
1969
and
abandoned
the
methodology.
now,
in
addition,
it
should
be
recognized
that
contrary
to
what
mr.
feit
has
said
this
morning,
or
this
afternoon,
pipeline
affiliates
and
pipelines
themselves
for
their
own
production
were
treated
exactly
the
same
for
comparable
categories
of
production
under
natural
gas
act
regulation.
there
was
absolutely
no
difference.
now
even
assuming
arguendo
then
that
the
rationale
they
have
put
forward
had
any
merit,
it
would
apply
with
equal
force
to
pipeline
affiliate
production.
and
they
make
no
argument
that
pipeline
affiliate
production
is
not
expressly
covered
by
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978.
no,
the
rationale
they
put
forward
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
intrastate
pipeline
production
or
distributor
production.
the
commission
didn't
regulate
that
under
the
natural
gas
act,
and
yet,
congress
extended
its
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
to
state
production.
moreover,
mr.
feit
gave
you
no
citation
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
which
even
remotely
suggests
that
congress
sought
to
carve
out
in-production
from
the
sweeping
coverage
of
the
act.
and
you
can't
real...
you
can't
read
the
conference
report
accompanying
this
legislation
and
come
away
with
anything
but
the
distinct
impression
congress
meant
to
establish
a
comprehensive
uniform
pricing
structure
to
apply
to
all
gas
production
sold
in
the
united
states
whether
interstate
or
intrastate.
finally,
the
rationale
would
produce
absurd
results.
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
rationale
would
treat
pipeline
affiliate
production
differently
than
pipeline
affiliate...
than
pipeline
production
when
they
were
treated
the
same
under
natural
gas
act
regulation,
it
also
should
be
recognized
that
new
gas,
which
is
one
of
the
categories
under
the
title
i
pricing
structure,
that
new
gas
is
no
less
new
gas
simply
because
it's
produced
by
a
pipeline.
yes,
produced
from
certain
high
cost
geological
formations,
has
to
be
produced
from
that
formation
irrespective
of
whether
a
pipeline
or
an
independent
producer
produces
the
gas.
there
are
many
wells
throughout
the
country
that
are
jointly
owned
by
a
pipeline
with
other
producers.
it
is
the
height
of
absurdity
to
believe
that
the
gas
produced
from
that
well
by
a
pipeline
should
be
valued
any
different
than
the
gas
from
the
same
well
owned
by
an
independent
producer
or
by
a
pipeline
affiliate.
now
apart
from
the
lack
of
support
in
the
plain
meaning
of
section
2(21),
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
act
that
also
support
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
section
203(b)
defines
the
cost
of
gas
to
be
passed
through
to
certain
industrial
customers.
the
general
rule
of
that
section
speaks
of
first
sale
acquisition
costs
is
the
price
paid
by
the
pipeline.
however,
subsection
2
had
to
state
a
separate
rule
applicable
to
pipeline
production.
the
separate
rule
expressly
recognizes
that
the
ferc
must
fashion
rules
governing
the
first
sale
acquisition
cost
for
pipeline
production.
now
the
reference
to
first
sale
acquisition
costs
for
pipeline
production
clearly
evidences
that
congress
envisioned
pipeline
production
would
be
the
subject
of
a
first
sale
at
the
intracorporate
transfer
point,
where
there
is
no
price
paid.
otherwise,
there
is
absolutely
no
meaning
to
that
provision
of
the
act.
notably
also,
the
conference
report
accompanying
the
act
states
that
section
501
provides
authority
to
the
commission
to
establish
rules
applicable
to
intracorporate
transactions
under
the
first
sale
definition.
now
it
doesn't
say
that
the
commission
can
exclude
sales
from
the
coverage
of
the
act.
it
says
that
the
commission
may
establish
rules
applicable
to
intracorporate
transactions
under
the
first
sale
definition.
that
clearly
means
the
intracorporate
transfers
were
considered
by
congress
to
be
under
the
first
sale
definition.
in
fact,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
even
remotely
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
commission
power
to
exclude
production
from
the
act's
coverage.
the
commission
was
only
given
the
power
to
prevent
the
circumvention
of
the
prices
established
in
that
act.
now,
petitioners
argue
that
intracorporate
transfers
do
not
involve
certain
conventional
indicia
of
a
sale
such
as
a
change
of
title
or
payment
of
cash.
petitioners'
arguments
in
this
respect
are
refuted
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
act
and
by
the
commission's
own
regulatory
methods.
the
term
2(20),
but
broadly
to
include
any
sale,
exchange
or
other
transfer
for
value.
now
the
court
of
appeals
properly
rejected
the
narrow
interpretation
because
it
would
have
frustrated
the
comprehensive
application
of
the
act,
and
because
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
rational
discrimination
between
like
categories
of
gas
production.
contrary
to
petitioners'
argument
the
intracorporate
transfer
does
have
significant
legal
and
economic
effects
and
they
are
transfers
for
value.
transfer
triggers
the
payment
by
the
pipeline
of
royalties
on
the
value
of
the
production.
the
transfer
triggers
the
payment
of
state
severance
taxes
on
the
value
of
the
production.
and
the
transfer
to
the
pipelines
transmission
system
requires
it.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
well,
there's
only
one
definition
section
for
the
entire
act,
so
any
definition
that's
set
forth
at
the
beginning
of
the
act
is
encompassed
and
is
used
for
all
of
the
titles
of
the
act
so
that
the
other--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--well
the
commission
has...
i
think
the
commission
is
relying
upon
section
2(21)
which
is
in
the
definition
section
at
the
outset
of
the
act
and
they
are
saying
that
that
section
does
not
authorize
them
to
regulate
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
intracorporate
transactions
by
pipeline
companies
where
they
transferred
their
own
production
into
their
systems.
and
i
think
they're
relying
directly
upon
section
2(21).
they
may
be
referring
to
other
sections
of
the
act,
too.
we
think
other
sections
of
the
act
do
support
the
fact
that
congress
intended
that
intracorporate
transactions
would
be
treated
as
first
sales.
i've
just
cited
the
section
203
and
i
plan
to
mention
the
section--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--they
simply
have
failed
to
recognize
that
the
definition
of
first
sale
does
indeed
include
a
sale
by
a
pipeline
of
its
own
production.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
well,
because
i
represent
the
pipelines
that
have
their
own
production
and
who
are
not
therefore
being
given
the
incentive
prices
that
congress
intended
by
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978.
but
the
commission
wants
to
retain
the
very
kind
of
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act
that
lead
to
natural
gas
shortages
in
this
country.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
that's
true,
justice
o'connor.
and
there
are
some--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--i'd
like
to
address
the
windfall
argument
right
now.
the
commission
argues
that
because
certain
pipeline
production
was
treated
on
a
cost-of-service
basis
under
the
natural
gas
act
regulation,
that
the
pipeline
enjoyed
certain
benefits
and
less
risk
than
independent
producers.
from
this
premise
they
further
argue
that
applying
the
natural
gas
policy
act
prices
to
pipeline
producers
would
grant
them
a
windfall.
this
argument
has
no
basis
at
all.
first
of
all,
a
pipeline
can
receive
no
greater
price
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
for
its
production
than
is
received
for
comparable
categories
of
gas
produced
by
independent
producers
and
pipeline
affiliates.
secondly,
the
act's
pricing
structure
itself--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--absolutely
wrong.
first
of
all,
a
great
deal
of
production
developed
with
the
pipelines.
the
risks
were
taken
for
that
production
before
there
was
a
natural
gas
act
or
any
commission
regulation
under
the
act.
the
risks
of
whether
they
found
gas
were
taken
long
before
the
natural
gas
act
of--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--even
during
that
period
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
pipeline
was
returned
the
revenues
required
for
it
to
be
encouraged
to
go
on
with
production
was
dependent
upon
a
myriad
of
factors.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
well,
there
was
first
of
all...
there
was
no
difference
at
all
between
pipelines
and
pipeline
affiliates.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
but
between
the
independent
producers...
when
congress
first
embarked
upon
regulation
of
independent
producers
in
1954
up
until
1960
they
tried
to
regulate
independent
producers
on
a
cost-of-service
basis.
in
1960,
in
the
second
phillips
case,
why,
they
abandoned
that
and
went
to
area
rate
making.
now
under
area
rate
making...
incidentally,
they
abandoned
it,
they
abandoned
cost-of-service
rate
making
for
pipelines
themselves
in
1969,
only
nine
years
later.
in
area
rate
making
the
commission
determined
a
cost-of-service
for
an
entire
area.
and
it
allowed
the
same
costs
for
that...
in
that
determination
as
it
would
allow
for
an
individual
company
cost-of-service.
there
was
no
difference
in
the
classification
of
the
cost
that
went
into
that
cost-of-service.
they
were
the
same
costs
that
went
into
the
cost-of-service.
now
the
argument
of
the
commission
is,
well,
but
you
were
guaranteed
somehow
that
you
would
get
your
exploratory
costs
back,
your
dry
hole
costs
back,
as
a
result
of
being
on
an
individual
company
cost-of-service
basis.
and
to
some
extent,
if
you
assumed
that
cost-of-service
regulation,
in
fact,
did
work...
and
it
didn't...
if
you
assume
that
it
worked
there
would
be
some
merit
to
their
argument,
but
the
point
is
that
both
the
commission
with
respect
to
independent
producer
regulation
abandoned
the
methodology,
and
then
later
abandoned
it
with
respect
to
pipeline
production
as
well.
and
as
i
say,
since
1969,
they
haven't
regulated
pipeline
or
pipeline
affiliate
production
on
the
basis
of
that
methodology.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
with
respect
to
independent
producers,
between
1960
and
1969,
there
was
a
difference
between
independent
producers
and
pipelines
and
pipeline
affiliates.
pipeline
and
pipeline
affiliates
were
treated
on
a
cost-of-service
basis.
independent
producers
were
treated
on
an
area
basis.
later--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--but
it
simply
is
not
a
windfall.
the
pipelines
can't
get
any
more
for
their
production
than
independent
producers
or
pipeline
affiliate
producers.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
they
would
get
more
money
than
if
the
commission
were
allowed
to
continue
regulation
they
don't
have
power
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
to
administer,
yes.
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
it
weren't
for
that.
but
let
me
put
that
money
in
context.
there's
an
appendix
d
filed
to
the
consolidated
natural
gas
company
brief
in
this
proceeding
which
clearly
shows
that
the
impact
of
applying
natural
gas
policy
act
prices
to
pipeline
production
is
less
than
one
and
one
half
percent
of
the
total
impact
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
for
the
period
of
1979
to
1981.
now
pipelines
during
that
period
contributed
about
five
percent
of
u.s.
production
and
this
would
strongly
suggest
that
independent
producer
prices
rise
more
than
pipeline
production
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
and
i
think
it
should
be
noted
by
this
court
that
the
commission
hasn't
brought
to
you
any
comparative
analysis
of
the
impact
upon
independent
producers
or
pipeline
affiliate
producers
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
they're
only
talking
with
one
side
of
the
aperture,
one
side
of
the
coin--
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
--if
there
were...
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
if
there
were
a
windfall,
that
windfall
would
be
just
as
applicable
to
pipeline
affiliate
producers
as
it
would
be
to
pipeline
producers.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
yes,
and
it
would
be.
and
they
were
treated
exactly
the
same
under
natural
gas
act
regulation.
if
the
affiliate
sold
his
gas
to
the
pipeline
under
natural
gas
act
regulation
part
of
the
price
that
he
got
back...
because
he
was
regulated
on
a
cost-of-service
basis
for
comparable
periods,
too...
the
price
he
got
back
was
to
reimburse
him
for
his
exploratory
expenses
as
well,
just
as
in
the
case
of
pipeline
production
that
was
taken
directly
into
the
system.
i'd
like
to
say,
just
briefly,
that
there
is
no
basis...
we
cover
completely
in
our
briefs
the
fact
that
the
application
of
title
i
prices
either
by
state
commission
or
by
a
federal
commission
doesn't
interfere
with
their
regulatory
processes
one
iota.
they
can
regulate
the
same
as
they
always
have
the
transmission
costs
of
interstate
pipelines
or
the
distribution
costs
of
distributors.
all
they
have
to
do
is
apply
the
title
i
price
at
the
point
where
the
gas
is
actually
produced.
and
i
might
add,
the
commission
itself
does
that
when
it
regulates
independent
producer
sales
that
are
made
far
beyond
the
wellhead,
either
at
the
outlet
of
a
processing
plant
or
at
a
central
point
in
the
field.
the
point
of
the
sale
isn't
the
consideration,
it's
whether
or
not
gas
is
sold
that's
the
real
point.
and
that's
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
across.
if
you
sell
gas
produced
in
the
united
states,
we
want
it
covered
by
this
policy.
and
they
carved
out
absolutely
no
exceptions.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
i'm
very
glad
you
asked
that.
the
price
levels
would
have
varied,
of
course,
from
pipeline
to
pipeline
but
i
certainly
represent
a
pipeline
where...
which
would
have
given
its
left
arm
to
have
had
area
rate
making
because
the
cost-of-service
pricing
that
the
commission
administered
on
that
pipeline
was
well
below
the
area
prices
they
would
have
been
entitled
to.
mr.
james
d.
mckinney,
jr.
i
think
it
probably
would
have
been
more
typical
than
not
typical,
although
that
would
be
quite
a
judgment
to
try
to
make.
