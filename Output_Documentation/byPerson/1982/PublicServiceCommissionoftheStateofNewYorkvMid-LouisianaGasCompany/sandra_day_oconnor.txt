mr.
feit,
is
your
argument
a
little
bit
inconsistent
with
ferc's
own
findings
in
connection
with
its
order
98,
that
extending
the
ngpa
pricing
to
this
production
would
encourage
production
and
help
eliminate
the
dual
market.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
does
seem
there
is
a
little
tension
between
the
articulations
of
ferc's
findings
and
your
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
any
of
the
gas
production
by
affiliates
of
interstate
pipelines
formerly
subject
to
the
cost-of-service
treatment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
one
more
question,
which
is,
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioner,
arizonia
electric
coop.
,
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
remanded
to
ferc
rather
than
vacating
order
98
once
it
determined
that
order
58
was
void?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
your
clients
would
receive
substantial
amounts
of
additional
money
if
they
were
given
first
sale
pricing
on
these
intracorporate
transfers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
now
that
gets
to
the
windfall
argument
and
i
would
be
interested
to
know
how
much
of
a
windfall
that
would
be.
are
we
talking
about
a
one
time
major
pricing
effect
or
would
it
even
out
after
that,
or
what
are
we
really
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
mckinney,
they...
it
did
apply,
did
it
not,
the
cost-of-service
pricing,
but
your
point
is
just
that
it
was
done
on
an
area
basis
so
it
didn't
focus
on
individual
companies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
we're
talking
about
the
pipelines,
of
course,
here.
and
so
you
were
treated
on
a
cost-of-service
basis,
and
therefore
the
argument
is
that
your
clients
would
now
get
a
windfall
by
application
of
this
first
sale
pricing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
call
it
what
you
will.
it
would
be
more
money.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
weren't
pipeline
affiliate
producers
getting
cost-of-service
pricing
before?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
the
point
of
the
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
significant,
on
the
increase
that
we're
talking
about--
