mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
poses
a
question
of
the
statutory
construction,
whether
congress
in
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978
meant
that
natural
gas
produced
by
a
pipeline
is
automatically
entitled
to
the
incentive
pricing
scheme
under
title
i
of
that
act.
even
though,
as
here,
the
gas
is
old
gas
long
dedicated
to
the
interstate
market.
in
our
view,
the
court
in
holding
that
the
first
sale
prices
and
that
the
pricing
scheme
of
title
i
applied
to
this
pipeline
produced
gas
misconceived
the
legislative
intent
and
argued,
granted
a
profit
to
which
the
pipeline
were
not
entitled,
$200
million
prospectively
and
something
over
$2
billion
total
projected.
these
are
complex
matters
under
a
complicated
statutory
scheme.
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
as
i
use
these
words
to
indicate
we're
talking
about
wellhead
or
field
sales,
mixed
systems
supply,
commingling,
downstream.
i
think
those
terms
are
essential
to
the
decision
making
in
this
case
and
they
also
have
functional
meaning
in
the
history
of
pipeline
regulation.
a
pipeline
gets
its
gas
from
many
wells.
it
can
be,
i
guess,
compared
to
a
tree
with
roots.
most
of
these
wells
are
operated
by
independent
producers.
some
are
pipeline
produced
wells.
normally,
in
the
usual
instance,
these
go
through
gathering
lines,
through
processing
plants
and
commingle
in
the
pipeline
and
become
part
of
fixed
pipeline
supply,
mixed
pipeline
supply.
and
they
go
downstream
to
the
pipelines'...
generally
to
the
pipelines'
regular
system
customers.
a
pipeline
also,
however,
produces
its
own
gas
which
it
sells
at
the
wellhead,
principally
to
other
pipelines,
sometimes
to
other
third
parties.
in
this
sense...
and
that's
part
of,
essential
of
our
argument...
it
functions
like
an
independent
producer.
these
differences
have
very
important
regulatory
considerations
in
the
historical
background.
first,
very
early
in
the
application
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
was
enacted
in
1938,
pipeline
produced
gas
was
deemed
to
be
like
other
gas
the
pipeline
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
it
was
deemed
to
be
part
of
the
entire
wholesale
transaction.
colorado
interstate,
a
decision
of
this
court,
made
that
clear.
and
it
was
subject
to
the
cost-of-service
methodology
which,
as
the
court
knows,
places
the
initial
risk
on
the
consumer.
the
gas
of
that
nature
is
the
gas
involved
here,
where
the
risk,
as
i
say,
is
the
consumer
risk.
on
the
other
hand,
as
the
court
will
recall,
it
was
not
until
1954,
when
the
phillips
case
was
decided,
that
the
independent
producer
was
deemed
to
be
a
natural
gas
company
covered
by
the
act,
by
the
natural
gas
act.
as
this
court
recognized
in
permian,
the
early
years
proved
to
be
a
time
of
very
difficulty
in
any
effort
to
regulate.
they
didn't...
they
weren't
natural
gas
companies
in
the
traditional
sense.
they
didn't
transport
in
interstate
commerce.
and
individual
cost-of-service
regulation
failed,
as
permian
points
out.
the
commission
then
turned
to
a
different
way
of
regulating
independent
producers.
the
regulation
consisted
of
average
industry
costs
based
upon
area
and
then
national
rates.
this
was
essentially
an
incentive
type
pricing.
for
example,
the
risk
was
on
the
investor.
if
an
independent
producer
produced
only
dry
holes,
he
got
no
recovery.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
he
operated
on
less
than
average
costs,
dug
a
well
which
produced,
then
he
was
able
to
make
a
profit
so
that
there
was
that
investor
risk
approach.
most
pertinently
as
this
development
occurred,
the
affiliate
of
the
pipeline,
the
affiliate
of
the
pipeline,
the
producing
affiliate
of
the
pipeline
was
accorded
the
same
treatment.
more
to
the
point
here
the
pipeline
who
sold
at
the
wellhead
was
given
this
economic
risk
establishment,
was
also
treated
as
an
independent
producer
would
be,
that
you
have
that
kind
of
development.
at
the
same
time,
as
the
years
went
on,
starting
in
'69
when
there
was
an
indication
of
a
gas
shortage,
the
commission
decided
to
give
not
cost
based
gas...
all
of
that
pre-'69
cost
based
gas
was
on
cost-of-service...
but
mixed
system
supplied
from
a
pipeline
to
be
on
parity,
giving
parity
pricing
to
the
independent
producer,
wellhead
pricing,
and
to
the
pipeline,
pricing
of
its
wellhead
sales.
but
cost-of-service
remained
on
cost-of-service.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
'70's,
in
the
early
'70's,
the
pipelines
essentially
either
through
agreements
or
through
their
own
choice
by
saying
we'd
rather
be
on...
we'd
rather
be
on
cost-of-service
with...
it
serves
our
purposes
better.
these
special
circumstance
pipelines
were
allowed
to
be
on
cost-of-service.
other
pipelines
as
to
this
mixed
system
supply
chose
instead
to
get
the
area
and
national
rates.
so
you
have
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act,
that
development
coupled
with
the
development
that
the
result
of
the
decision
in
the
phillips
case
had
lead
to
an
interstate
regulated
market
and
an
intrastate
unregulated
market
with
regard
to
independent
producer
sales
or
sales
like
independent
producers.
the
consequence
was
that
the
market
bifurcated.
the
independent
producer
certainly,
in
shopping
the
market
place
as
to
his
new
wells,
would
prefer
to
sell
it
in
the
intrastate
market,
which
he
did...
or
which
the
producers
generally
did.
the
consequences
were
there
was
less
gas
in
the
interstate
market,
more
gas
in
the
intrastate
market,
and
high
priced
gas.
this
was
the
bifurcation
coupled
with
the
fact
that
at
that
time
the
shortages
commenced.
now
i
would
like,
with
that
background,
to
turn
to
the
statutory
language.
statutory
language
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
our
main
brief,
or
in
the
appendix
at
e(1).
as
the
court
will
note,
the
first
portion
of
that
statute,
section
2(21),
was
a
definitional
section.
it
employed
a
term
for
sale.
and
under
that
initial
a
of
that
section
it
appears
that
every
sale...
the
universe
of
sales...
was
a
first
sales,
kind
of
a
jurisdictional
marking
point.
every
sale
was
a
first
sale.
the
critical
provision,
however,
is
in
subsection
b,
which
says
certain
sales
not
included.
and
the
certain
sales
not
included...
and
i'd
like
to...
i
think
this
is
essential
to
point
to
the
court...
that
it
shall
not
include
the
sale
of
any
volume
of
natural
gas
by
any
interstate
pipeline,
intrastate
pipeline,
or
local
distribution
company,
or
any
affiliate
thereof...
and
now
the
critical
language...
unless
such
sale
is
attributable
to
volumes
of
natural
gas
produced
by
the
pipeline,
the
interstate
pipeline,
or
the
local
distribution
company,
or
the
affiliate.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
well,
while
there
is
no
sale
we
must
set
up
if
there's
a
intra-corporate
transaction.
when
the
production
division
of
a
pipeline
transfers
the
gas
to
the
transportation
division
of
the
pipeline
there
is
a
hypothecated
first
sale.
therefore
the
higher
pricing
provisions
of
the
title
i
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
would
apply.
we
think
that
this
interpretation
flies
in
the
face
of
the
statute.
section
2(20),
which
is
also
printed
at
page
2
of
our
brief,
makes
it
clear
that
the
term
"sale"
means
a
transfer
for
value.
there
is
no
transfer
for
value
in
the
context
of
the
court
of
appeals
analysis.
more
significantly,
or
equally
significantly,
there's
no
contract.
there's
no
relationship
which
traditionally
has
been
the
basis
of
regulation
by
this
commission...
by
the
ferc...
under
the
natural
gas
act.
the
mobil
sierra
doctrine,
as
this
court
will
recall,
makes
it
clear
that
the
contract
to
the
parties
are
the
basis
for
the
relationship.
the
same
principle
attaches
quite
clearly
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
as
this
court's
decision
the
other
day
at
agency...
in
energy
reserves
makes
clear,
the
critical
consideration
is,
you
don't
get
the
contract,
you
don't
get
the
statutory
price,
you
get
the
contract
price
or
whichever
is
lower.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
initial
interpretation
by
the
court
of
appeals
cannot
withstand
the
statutory
language.
there's
another
interpretation
which
the
court
of
appeals
rejected,
but
which
is
made
by
several
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
would
regard
that
as
a
sale.
let
me
say
this,
mr.
justice--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--no,
but
there's
a
difference.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
the
difference
is
that
the
affiliate
has
been
on
cost.
he
acts
like
an
independent
producer.
he
sells
under
a
contract.
he
sells
at
the
wellhead.
functionally,
he's
the
equivalent
of
the
independent
producer,
and
economically
in
that
the
risk
lays
with
the
investor.
conceptually
the
affiliate
performs
like
an
independent
producer.
the
problem
that
you
point
to
in
terms
of
perhaps
intra-corporate,
it's
the
same
thing.
the
statute
has
an
affiliate
entities
limitations
which
makes
it
clear
that
where
an
affiliate
producer
sells
to
his
affiliated
pipeline
he
must
sell
at
the
comparable
price
sold
by
an
independent
producer.
now,
historically,
it's
not
clear
in
the
'50's
how
they
treated
the
affiliate
producer.
there's
some
indication
that
they
deemed
him
to
be
part
of
the
pipelines
at
the
transportation.
but
starting,
i
think
clearly,
in
the
late
'60's
and
the
early
'70's
affiliate
production
was
like
independent
producer
production,
both
economically
and
both
functionally.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
it...
no,
only
in
the
sense
of--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--i
guess
you
could
have
that,
but
two
answers.
one,
the
statutory
scheme
does
not
talk
about
that
kind
of
intra-corporate
transfer.
the
word
production...
affiliate...
production
affiliates
notes
contracts
and
on
the
face
of
it,
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
clear
statutory
distinction.
now
in
terms
of...
in
terms
of
parity
pricing
which
is
parity
with
independent
producer
sales,
the
commission
has
given
parity
pricing
to
mixed
system
supply
sales
by
a
pipeline,
but
that's
not
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
that's
a
matter
of
agency
interpretation
based
on
our
view
that
congress
left
to
the
commission
the
task
of
harmonizing
the
natural
gas
act
with
the
natural
gas
policy.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
no,
on
the
contrary.
i,
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
statutory
language...
it
doesn't
leap
from
the
page.
i
think
it
quite
clearly...
the
statutory
language
has
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
the
legislative
background
coupled
with
the
deference
if
there...
the
rule
as
i
understand
it
clearly
is
if
there
are
two
possible
interpretations
and
the
commission
or
the
regulatory
agency's
interpretation
is
a
rationally
based
interpretation.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
and
i
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
give
us
deference.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
because
it
said
that
we
had
no
input
into
the
first
sale
definition.
but,
yes.
i...
let
me
turn
a
bit
to
what
we
view
the
legislative
history
to
mean
it
to
say.
the
court
of
appeals...
the
central
assumption
of
the
court
of
appeals...
they
thought
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
pipelines
and
producers.
if
producers
are
entitled
to
monies
and
the
sale
price,
similarly
a
pipeline.
that
is
a
basic
fallacy
in
terms
of
the
statutory
scheme.
if
one
reads
the
legislative
history
and
looks
at
the
other
indicia
in
the
statute,
wellhead
pricing,
the
need
to
harmonize
title
6
which
retains
natural
gas
act
jurisdiction,
and
it
reads
the
background
of
the
history,
it's
clear
that
congress
was
making
a
discriminating
judgment.
congress
was
trying
to
overrule
phillips.
the
history
is
interesting
in
that
regard.
the
senate
bill
purported
to
decontrol,
deregulate
old
gas
and
keep
new
gas
under
regulation.
it
had
an
affiliate
entities
rule
which
seem
to
cover...
cover
pipeline
produced
gas.
on
the
other
hand,
the
house
bill...
the
house
bill
clearly
was
aimed
at
what
they
called
the
1954
decision.
well,
the
1954
decision
was
phillips.
nor
throughout
the
history
of
the
debates
for
over
two
years
did
any
pipeline
that
i
could
find
in
the
history
say,
oh,
yes,
we're
entitled
to
this
price.
that
view...
that
view,
in
our
judgement,
was
the
one
that
congress
enacted
in
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
a
discriminating
statutory
construction
approach
which
meant
to
deal
with
the
problem,
the
problem
of
phillips.
pipelines
were
not
involved
in
the
bifurcated
market.
pipelines
had
system
supply.
they
served
their
customers,
the
mixed
system
supply.
true
enough,
their
production
increased
in
times
of
shortage
and
helped
the
market
that
they
were
in.
but
that,
the
commission
recognized
by
its
parity
pricing
policy.
the
bifurcation
was
a
producing
problem.
whether
the
producer
was
the
independent
producer
or,
in
fact,
the
pipeline
who
sold
at
the
wellhead.
and
i
might
point
out
in
that
regard
that
pipeline...
our
figures
indicate
that
pipeline
production
is
about
5.
,
5.1
percent
of
the
total
production,
so
that
we're
dealing
with
an
independent
producer
statute
which
says
only
those
whether
they
be
affiliates,
whether
they
be
pipelines
who
perform
functionally
and
economically
as
the
independent
producer,
are
entitled
to
the
independent
producer
pricing.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
is
not
entitled
to
the
first
sale,
yes.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it's
not
first
sale,
first,
because
as...
the
statute
language
doesn't
compel
it.
it's
not
a
first
sale
because...
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
think
it
points
the
other
way.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that's
precisely
our
point.
we
think
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
meet
the
phillips
problem.
we
think
the
error,
the
fatal
error
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
its
assumption
that
this
was
an
entitlement.
i
mean
because...
it
seems
to
me
a
strange
legislative
doctrine
that
because
you're
meeting
the
problems
of
independent
producing
production
by...
to
avoid
the
bifurcated
market
that
at
the
same
time...
and
this
seems
to
be
the
argument...
at
the
same
time
while
we
pipelines,
we're
entitled
to
it,
too.
it
seems
to
me
there
had
to
be
a
basic
reason
why
pipeline
production
other
than
wellhead
sale
production...
wellhead
sale
was
intended
by
congress.
in
that...
in
that
regard
the
commission
left...
we,
the
ngpa,
as
leaving
to
the
commission
the
problem
of
harmonizing
the
natural
gas
act
with
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
in
that
harmonization
we
have...
that
is
the
commission
have...
has
set
up
a
basis
of
attributing
pricing
similar
to
our
independent
producer
production.
and
i...
my--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--i
would
have
to
see
how
that
gas
is
sold
and
how
the
impact
is--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--i
think
the
logic
of
my
position
would
be
that
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
overrule
phillips
and
that
we
would
read
the
statute
as
not
covering
that
gas
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
that
gas
production
has
a
very
substantial
impact
on
the
bifurcated
market.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
it
would.
let
me
just
make
my
point...
i
repeat,
the
critical
consideration
is
a
contract...
a
contractual
relationship.
for
example,
in
your
situation
there
would
be
no
contract,
so
the
pipeline
could
get
the
highest
maximum
lawful
price
while
the
independent
producer
who
was
operating
pursuant
to
a
contract
would
get
a
lesser
amount.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
awfully...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it
wasn't--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--i
don't
think
the
contract
revisions
is
technical.
you're
right
mr.
justice.
the
statute--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--the
statute
is
a
technical
statute,
undeniably.
it's
very
technical.
and
as
i
say,
it
doesn't
leap
from
the
page.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
gas
produced
by
pipelines
would
have
an
effect
on
the
phillips
type
problem,
my
answer
to
you
would
be
yes.
and
i
assume
the
more
you
found
the
gas
industry
producing
in
that
fashion,
the
more
likely
one
would
say
that
congress
didn't
act
stupidly.
it
acted
to
solve
the
problem.
so
i
assume
i
would
reach
a
point
which
says,
yes,
even
though
there's
not
a
contract.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
that's
not
the
case.
the
case
is
that
there
were
5.1
percent
produced.
there
was
no
contract.
there
is
no
economic...
economic
functional
equivalence.
and
more
to
the
point
here...
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
we're
dealing
with
old
gas,
always
on
cost-of-service.
and
as
a
result
of
which,
to
us,
this
would
be
a
windfall.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
i
think
that
it's
not
an
inconsistency,
i
think.
maybe
it
could
be
rationalized
our
position
is
this,
that
order
98...
which
by
the
way
is
not
here
in
terms
of
the
substantive
basis...
was
based
on
the
notion
that
the
commission
believed
that
the
natural
gas
policy
act
left
the
natural
gas
act
control
of
pipelines
intact.
in
exercizing
its
discretion
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
commission
recognized
that
there
were
gas
shortages,
that
there
was
need
for
gas
in
the
interstate
market.
and
it
was
based
upon
that
notion
that
it
adopted
the
parity
policy...
parity
plan.
our
position
is
simply
that
the
statutory
development
was
based
upon
essentially
to
get
rid
of
phillips.
the
1954
decision
that
appears
in
the
house
bill,
it
appears--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--i
would
say
there
is
a
tension
and
perhaps
ferc
could
have
done
it
somewhat
differently.
but
it
read
the
statute
as
essentially
a
matter
with
a
functional
and
the
economic
equivalence
were
entitled
to
first
sale
status.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
it's
hard
to
say.
i
would
say
early
on...
early
on...
in
the
early
interpretation,
affiliates
who
sold
to
their
pipelines,
that
went
into
system
supply,
and
the
chances
are
yes.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
as
we
get
into
this
late
'60's
and
'70's
we
find
that
affiliate
production
is
treated
like
independent
producer
production.
that
is...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they'd
only
sell
to
their
pipelines.
our
figures
show
that
they'd
sell
one
third
of
their
sales
to
a
third
parties.
the
concern
that
the
court
has
with
regard
to
the
form
over
substance...
that
is,
why
should
there
be
a
difference
between
the
two...
it
seems
to
us
rests
upon
contract
and
congress
took
care
of
that
by
saying
that
where
an
affiliate
produced
and
sold
gas
to
its
pipelines,
not
to
its
third
party...
produced
and
sold
to
its
pipeline,
that
in
that
situation
there
was
an
affiliate
entities
limitation.
the
price
had
to
be
comparable.
another
point
i
would
make
in
this
regard.
there
may
be
an
argument
that
says
that
now
they
can
spin
it
off.
the
commission
has
indicated
that
it
will
look
very
closely
at
that
possibility.
so
it
seems
to
me,
in
summary,
and
i'd
like
to
preserve
a
bit
of
time,
that
this
functional
economic
division
remains.
the
statute
permits
that
reading.
the
court
misconceived
the
history
of
the
act
and
did
not
give
this
agency
the
deference
in
this
very
technical
and
difficult
area.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
of
course
my
position
is
that
58
was--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--was
valid.
i...
presumably
yes,
it
should
have
sent
it
back.
thank
you,
i'll
reserve
what
i
have.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
want
to
make
a
few
points.
first,
justice
stevens,
if
the
affiliate
production
by
the
late
'60's
and
70's,
the
affiliate
production
were
making
wellhead
sales
and
were
costed
at
investor
risk
under
the
parity
and
national
rates,
so
that
there
was
a
difference,
cost-of-service
gas
was
based
upon
the
normal
prudential
investments
which
the
consumer
paid.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
in
the
'70's
it
was
not.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
unless
it
was...
unless
i'm...
in
general,
it
was
not.
unless,
as
i
understand
it,
569
was
a
'69
order.
if
it
were...
i
don't
know...
less
than
ten
percent
or
more
than
ten
percent
or
less...
but
in
the
'70's
it
was...
even
if
it
were
sold
to
the
pipeline.
but
i
want
to
make
another
point
in
that
regard.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
not...
never
a
hundred
percent
sure
i'm
right.
i'm
suggesting
two
things.
one,
first,
one
third
of
the
sales
are
made
non...
not
to--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--the
history
is
not,
back
here
in
the
'50's.
my
understanding
is
that
the
'60's
and
'70's,
it
was,
whether
sold
to
the
pipeline...
it
was
costed
on
area
national
rates.
now
i
would
like
if
the
court
would
wish
me
to
submit
a
memorandum
referring--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--well
i
don't--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--as
my
understanding
is,
by
the
'70's
whether
it
was
sold
to
the
pipeline
or
to
a
third
party,
it
was
on
area
national
rates.
justice
rehnquist,
you
refer
to
what
what
other
provisions
of
the
act
would
refer
to...
title
6
deals
with
interstate
pipelines
and
the
costing
of
interstate
pipelines.
it
talks
about
a
first
sale
as
if
obviously
the
pipeline
purchased
that
from
the
producer.
at
the
bottom
of
the
case
though,
it
seems
to
me,
that
we're
talking
about
cost-of-service
gas
which
is
always
been
priced
on
traditional
cost-of-service
pricing.
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
suggests
that
congress
wanted
to
overrule
that
determination.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
it
had
it
would
have
said
something.
what
appears
here
constantly
is
reference
primarily
or
basically
to
phillips
and
independent
producer
pricing.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
if,
in
fact...
if,
in
fact,
that
was
a
first
sale,
right.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
well
if...
if--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--well
it
draws
the
distinction
since
the
early
'70's.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
yes,
i
wanted
to
mention
that.
we
haven't
retroactively
determined
the
amounts,
but
speculatively
we're
talking
about
$200
million
a
year.
and
somewhere
over
$2
billion
until
this
old
gas...
let
me
just
make
a
reference...
you
reminded
me...
it's
about
$2
billion
total.
the
real
issue
here
is
economically
a
stripper
well
gas,
which
means
a
well
is
depleted.
cost-of-service
his...
the
consumer
has
borne
the
risk.
this
is
the
highest
price
of
regulated
gas
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
pricing
scheme
if
first
sale
prices
were
attributed
to
it,
the
pipeline
company
would
be
able
to
charge
off
all
of
the
expenses
of
redeveloping
that
well
on
the
highest...
or
one
of
highest
ngpa
pricing
structures.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
a
section
floor
proceeding
the
normal
way
a
pipeline
gets
its
rates,
prudent
costs
would
apply.
but
here
you're
saying
that
a
consumer
has
borne
all
the
risks.
its
an
old
well,
and
suddenly
incentive
pricing
permits
these
kinds
of
prices
to
go
to
interstate
pipelines.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
congress
did
but--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--yes,
but
i
think
in
terms
of
a
response
to
you,
there
was
nothing
in
the
congressional
debates
that
one
of
the
incentive
pricing
schemes
would
apply
to
any
other
than
independent
producers
and
those
that
function
like
independent
producers.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that's...
my
point
is,
you're
getting
a
response
to
the
question,
that
affiliates
up
to
the
late
'60's
and
early
'70's
functioned
like
independent
producers.
the
history
is
such
that
the
court
must
remember
that
up
until
the
decision
in
phillips
the
question
of
production
ingathering
was
a
problem.
an
affiliate
might
not
very
well
have
been
even
deemed
to
be
covered
by
the
act.
and
it
was
in
the
late
'60's
where
affiliate
production
became
more
and
more
like
independent
producer
production.
the
commission's
approach
in
the
'70's
and
in
order
98,
at
the
enactment
of
the
1978
act,
was
precisely
that.
that
the
affiliate,
whether
he
sold
to
a
third
party
or
through
his
pipeline,
is
selling
like
an
independent
producer,
and
in
our
view,
is
entitled
to
that
kind
of
pricing
while
the
pipeline...
as
long
as
he
doesn't
make
a
first
sale...
if
he
makes
a
first
sale,
as
herweg
defined
it,
is
not...
a
mixed
system
supply
is
not
entitled
to
first
sale
pricing.
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
that's
exactly
what
would
be--
mr.
jerome
m.
feit
--without
regard
except
that
it
suggests
itself
to
me
that
congress
would
hardly
have
adopted
a
theory
without
any
affirmative
statement
to
that
effect
which
would
have
lead
to
what
we
think
are
the
windfall
pricing
that
would
follow
from
treating
pipeline
production
as
a
first
sale.
thank
you.
