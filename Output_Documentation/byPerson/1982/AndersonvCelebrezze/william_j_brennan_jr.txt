justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
is
a
considered
state
interest.
do
you
mean
compelling?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
basically,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
if,
as
you,
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
white,
you
fail
on
the
argument
that
there
is
an
overbreadth
about
this
statute
that
requires
that
it
be
struck
down
under
the
first
amendment,
that
alternatively
in
any
event
the
state
can't
justify
this
statute
without
establishing
a
compelling
state
interest,
which
it
has
not
done.
am
i
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
you
do...
you
do
suggest,
do
you
not,
that
the
standard
of
review
ought
to
be
strict
scrutiny?
