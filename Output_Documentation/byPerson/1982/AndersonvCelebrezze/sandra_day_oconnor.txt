justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
frampton,
exactly
what
is
the
first
amendment
right
being
asserted
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
you
articulate
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
ohio
permit
write-in
candidates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
how
is
the
right
to
vote
infringed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
are
not
relying
really
on
some
right
to
be
a
candidate,
then.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
clements
versus
fashing
bears
on
that,
where
the
court
indicated
there
wasn't
such
a
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
have
said
there
isn't
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
be
a
candidate,
then
can
the
voters
have
some
right
that
hinges
on
some
right
to
be
a
candidate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
frampton,
is
there
any
evidence
here
that
indicates
how
many
late
blooming
third
force
candidates
like
the
petitioner
anderson
have
sought
and
been
denied
access
to
ohio's
general
election
ballot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
evidence
as
to
how
many
have
been
denied
access?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
you
do
recognize
that
there
is
a
right
of
political
association
that
may
be
affected,
but
you
are
just
saying
it
isn't
much
of
an
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
is
some
first
amendment
right
here
at
stake
which
you
would
recognize,
apparently,
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
may
be
a
threshold
inquiry
of
whether
it
is
an
undue
burden
or
something
of
that
kind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
any
other
state
have
a
filing
deadline
as
early
as
ohio's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
indiana?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
focus,
mr.
taylor,
on
the
right
of
the
voter,
and
then
make
the
inquiry
whether
it
is
an
undue
burden,
how
do
you
respond
to
the
argument
that
it
is
a
severe
burden
because
they
simply
aren't
entitled
to
vote
at
all
for
mr.
anderson?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
of
course
those
weren't
the
late
blooming
people
out
of
a
political
party,
like
mr.
anderson
says
that
his
situation
represents.
so
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
if
there
were
other
people
like
mr.
anderson
who
came
late
out
of
a
political
party
structure
who
were
denied
access
to
the
ballot
in
ohio.
