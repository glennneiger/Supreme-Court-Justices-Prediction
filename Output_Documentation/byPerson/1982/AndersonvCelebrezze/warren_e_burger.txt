mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
about
30
days
or
so
after
the
filing
deadline?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
he
had
filed
once
under
a
party
designation
and
then
sought
to
file
later
as
a
third
party
candidate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
after
he
had...
even
after
he
had
taken
these
other
steps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
ohio
permit
a
write-in
candidate
in
the
election
for
president
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
whose
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
may
people
just
walk
into
the
voting
place
and
vote
for
a
person
for
president
who
has
never
indicated
any
interest
in
the
position?
in
some
states,
that
can
be
done.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
by
that
that
having
filed
as
a
republican,
he
had
decided
to
change
horses,
or
maybe
change
from
riding
a
horse
to
walking.

e.
burger
now,
when
a
candidate
misses
that
deadline,
an
independent
candidate,
do
i
understand
correctly
from
what
you
said
that
if
he
gives
40
days'
notice,
then
he
may
have
a
write-in
campaign,
and
his...
any
written
in
ballots
will
be
counted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
the
door
is
not
completely
closed
to
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
frampton?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren

burger

anderson
against
celebrezze
will
be
announced
by
justice
