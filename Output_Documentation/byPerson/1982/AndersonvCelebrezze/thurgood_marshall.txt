justice

marshall
mr.
taylor,
it
is
still
not
clear
to
me
what
the
petitioner
in
this
case
could
have
done
in
march
and
complied
with
your
law.
could
he
have
said
that
i
am
a
candidate
on
the
republican
convention,
and
if
i
don't
make
that,
i
want
to
be
an
independent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
would
deny
him
the
right
to
run
in
the
convention.
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn't
the
state
of
ohio
telling
him
that
he
can't
run
in
the
convention?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
imagine
a
political
party
nominating
a
man
that
is
an
independent
candidate
in
50
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
highly
unlikely.
well,
okay.
well,
it
did
happen
in
california,
did
it
not?
on
some
occasions?
or
aren't
you
familiar
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
taylor,
are
you
urging
that
the
problem
with
this
case
is
to
adjust
constitutional
rights
to
political
theorists
and
theories?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
these
six
people
or
whatever
it
is,
i
don't
even
know
what
you
are
talking
about.
i
mean,
we
can't
adjust
constitutional
theories
to
what
they
predict
that
a
voter
will
do,
can
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
have
that
is
unanimously
agreed
is
how
the
political
theory
works?
i
mean,
i
for
one
can
mention
at
least
one
occasion
when
all
the
political
theorists
in
the
world
were
wrong.
and
i
bet
you
could,
too.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
which
one
i
want
to
give
you.

justice
thurgood

the
constitution
should
be
measured
by
a
practical
matter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
write-in
ballots
were
cast
in
the
last
election
in
the
whole
state
of
ohio?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
anybody?
no.
you
know
they
weren't
even
counted,
were
they?
