justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
person
would
have
had
to
have
filed
or
made
his
intentions
to
run
in
the
primary
known
before
his
withdrawal.
he
couldn't
withdraw
if
he
wasn't
running.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
that
regard,
mr.
frampton,
are
you
suggesting
that
without
regard
to
how
this
statute
was
applied
to
mr.
anderson
and
his
supporters,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
is
that
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
as
it
is
applied
to
congressman
anderson,
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
his
case,
and
if
you
say
that...
if
you...
let's
just
assume
that
as
applied
in
this
case,
it
was
constitutionally
applied.
just
assume
that.
i
take
it
your
position
is
nevertheless
the
statute
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it
might
be
applied
unconstitutionally
in
other
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
the
very
case
that
the
statute
was
not
unconstitutionally
applied
to
him.
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
what
about
this
law?
it
would
nevertheless
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
why
would
you...
why
would
you...
why
would
you
think
you
were
entitled
to
have
it
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
just
because
it
might
be
applied
to
others
in
an
unconstitutional
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
want
to
know
what
the
thrust
of
your
position
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
still...
i
still
want
to
know
whether
we
should
judge
this
case...
we
should
ask
ourselves
whether
this
statute
was
constitutionally
applied
to
anderson
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
or
whether
we
must
also
ask,
well,
that
is
sort
of
irrelevant,
is
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
because
it
is
overbroad,
or
because
of
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
the
test
is
just
mere
rationality.
and
you
seem
to...
i
know
you
say
it
is
strict
scrutiny,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
discriminatory,
it
does,
of
course,
it
treats
party
people
and
independents
differently.
is
that
what
you
mean
by
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
that
it...
you
are
not
suggesting
that
just
because
they
are
treated
differently,
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
your
second
point,
do
you
say
the
same
thing
about
not
only
the
candidate
but
about
his
supporters?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
opposition
stresses
the
associational
right
rather
than
the
candidate's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
only
need
one
case,
don't
you,
and
it
did
keep
him
off
the
ballot,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
ohio?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
ohio?
