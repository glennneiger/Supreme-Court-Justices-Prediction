may
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second
here?
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
inconsistency
between
your
two
arguments.
your
first
argument
that
there
is
no...
you
are
comparing
different
things
says
that
the
process
in
the
party
process
is
more
complicated,
and
there
are
special
problems
associated,
which
would
seem
to
justify
a
longer
period
to...
for
party
candidates.
but
once
you
said
they
are
different.
now
you
are
saying,
well,
there
is
no
discrimination
because
they
are
the
same.
but
if
the
reason
for
the
length
of
time
required
for
the
party
process
doesn't
apply
to
the
independents,
why
do
you
have
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i
don't
make
my
question
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
are
sort
of
inconsistent
with
one
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
reason
you
say
that
is,
you
say
you
need
more
time
to
process
the
party
candidates.
that
is
the
heart
of
your
argument,
as
i
understood
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
can
then
that
justify
treating
them
equally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
by
hypothesis
you
have
settled
with
her...
justice
o'connor
brought
up,
we
are
not
interested
in
the
burden
on
the
candidate.
we
are
interested
in
the
burden
on...
i
don't
know
how
many,
6
percent
of
the
electorate
was
that
wanted
to
vote
for
mr.
anderson.
we
are
talking
about
the
burden
on
those
people,
as
to
whether
they
can
vote
for
the
person
they
want
to
vote
for.
and
it
seems
to
me
your
job
is
to
explain
to
us
that
that
is
a
reasonable...
it
is
reasonable
to
say
to
that
6
percent
of
the
electorate,
no,
you
cannot
vote
for
mr.
anderson,
for
these
reasons.
you
are
talking
about,
you
know,
the
burden
on
mr.
anderson,
which
is
not
what
we
are
interested
in.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
difference
is
that
here
we
can
see
the
burden.
we
know
how
many
people
voted
for
him.
and
there
were
quite
a
few.
we
don't
have
any
other
case
like
this?
your
five
minor
party
candidates
that
you
say
got
on
the
ballot,
you
had
all
of
them
up
together,
and
i
bet
they
didn't
get
as
many
votes
as
he
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
a
big
disability
imposed
by
your
state
statute.
that
is
a
disability
imposed
by
party
problems.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
really,
all
you
are
arguing
is
that
this
doesn't
happen
very
often,
but
the
question
is,
when
it
happens,
what
is
the
state
interest
in
justifying
refusing
to
let
this
large
group
of
people
vote
for
the
person
they
want
to
vote
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
taylor,
before
you
sit
down,
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question.
you
started
to
identify
three
different
state
interests
that
were
at
stake
here.
one
was
the
equal
treatment
of
candidates.
the
second
was
voter
education.
you
never
got
to
the
third.
what
was
the
third?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
i
had
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
ohio
statute
that
requires
an
independent
candidate
for
the
office
of
presidency
in
the
united
states
to
file
a
statement
of
candidacy
as
it
worked
out
in
1980
in
march
of,
i
think
by
march
20,
1980,
in
other
words,
several
months
in
advance
with
the
november
election.
petitioner,
anderson,
announced
that
he
was
a
candidate,
an
independent
candidate
for
president
on
april
24,
1980,
which
was
after
the
statutory
deadline
that
already
passed.
he
assembled
the
necessary
signatures
and
petitioners
and
sought
to
file
them
in
may
but
the
secretary
of
the
state
of
ohio
rejected
the
filing
because
it
was
not
timely.
he
therefore
brought
suit
in
federal
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
federal
statute
and
the
district
judge
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
entered
an
injunction
requiring
that
his
name
be
allowed
to
appear
on
the
ballot.
the
election
was
held
without
the
injunction
having
been
stayed
and
after
the
election,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reviewed
the
district
court
decision
and
reversed
and
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
principally
on
the
ground
that
performed
the
function
of
allowing
the
voters
adequate
time
to
become
informed
about
the
qualifications
of
candidates.
because
two
other
circuits
had
decided
these
similar
questions
in
a
different
way
involving
similar
state
statutes,
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit,
and
we
hold
that
the
statute
unconstitutionally
abridges
the
associational
rights
of
the
voters
who
seek
to
support
the
candidacy
of
the
independent
candidate
which
rights
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justice
white,
justice
powell,
and
justice
o'connor.
