mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
ohio's
early
filing
deadline
for
independent
candidates
as
that
provision
is
applied
to
independent
presidential
candidates.
the
statute
requires
all
independent
candidates
seeking
ballot
access
in
november
to
file
a
declaration
of
candidacy
and
5,000
petition
signatures
of
ohio
registered
voters
at
least
75
days
before
ohio's
early
june
primary,
which
in
1980
was
march
20th.
primary
partisan
candidates
seeking
to
run
in
the
primaries,
party
primaries,
also
must
file
by
this
same
date,
but
partisan
presidential
candidates
need
not
file
for
or
run
in
ohio's
presidential
primaries
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
november.
under
ohio
law,
both
minor
party
and
major
party
candidates,
if
selected
by
their
parties
some
time
before
late
august,
will
appear
on
ohio's
ballot
regardless
of
whether
those
candidates
were
declared
candidates
in
march
or
april
or
may,
regardless
of
whether
they
ran
in
ohio's
primary
or
any
other
primary,
regardless
of
whether
they
came
into
ohio
or
did
anything
in
ohio
prior
to
august.
now,
in
the
winter
and
spring
of
1980,
congressman
john
anderson
was
a
republican
candidate
for
the
nomination
of
the
republican
party
as
president
of
the
united
states.
when
it
became
clear
that
his
support
was
coming
not
so
much
from
republican
party
regulars
as
from
more
or
less
equally
republicans,
democrats,
and
independents,
on
april
24,
1980,
he
announced
that
he
was
abandoning
his
republican
quest
and
would
seek
to
become
an
independent
candidate
nationwide.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
same
day,
april
24,
he
also
notified
the
respondent
in
this
case,
the
secretary
of
state,
that
he
was
timely
withdrawing
from
the
republican
primary
in
ohio,
in
which
he
was
entered,
and
the
state
has
stipulated
and
conceded
from
the
beginning
of
this
lawsuit
that
anderson's
timely
withdrawal
from
the
republican
primary
in
ohio
means
that
he
was
not
barred
from
getting
on
the
general
election
ballot
by
ohio's
so-called
sore
loser
statute.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
because
the
ohio
legislature
has
already
made
a
judgment
about
whether
that
would
disqualify
a
person
in
mr.
anderson's
position
from
getting
on
the
general
election
ballot.
that
judgment
is
reflected
in
its
sore
loser
statute,
3513.04,
which
provides
in
substance
that
someone
who
loses
the
primary,
party
primary,
cannot
thereafter
run
as
an
independent,
and
in
a
specific
withdrawal
statute
providing...
that
applies
specifically
to
presidential
primary
candidates,
that
holds
that
a
presidential
candidate
who
withdraws
from
a
presidential
primary
is
entitled
to
do
that
within
30
days
of
the
party
primary,
which
would
be
early
may,
and
the
state
has
stipulated
that
by
virtue
of
that
timely
withdrawal,
the
sore
loser
ban
didn't
apply
to
him.
after
this
notification
on
april--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
i
think
the
point
is
that
the
sore
loser
statute,
that
is,
the
statute
that
directs
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
a
candidate
has
previously
sought
to
gain
the
party
nomination
is...
expresses
a
very
different
state
interest
than
the
filing
deadline,
and
the
filing
deadline
is
a
much
more
burdensome
provision,
because
it
bars
all
independent
candidates
and
all
independent-minded
voters
after
march
20
from
putting
forward
an
independent
candidate,
whereas
the
sore
loser
provision
applies
only
to
individual
candidates,
and
doesn't
bar
the
voters
from
putting
forward
another
independent
until
some
time
very
late
in
the
summer.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
justice--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
is
directly
the
first
amendment
right
of
the...
principally
being
asserted
in
this
case
is
the
right
of
the
voters
and
citizens,
including
those
petitioners
who
are
ohio
registered
voters
who
are
seeking
to
support
congressman
anderson
by
putting
forward
his
name
and
having
him
on
the
ballot,
their
right
to
associate
for
the
purpose
of
putting
their
candidate
before
whatever
body
the
state
designates
to
select
its
electors
in
november.
and
in
addition,
i
think
what
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
cases
as
an
intertwined
but
somewhat
separate
right
to
vote
which
is
not
found
as
such
in
the
constitution,
but
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
is
fundamental
to
the
democratic
process,
and
is
important
if
any
of
the
rights
in
the
constitution--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--yes,
it
does,
and
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
ohio
code
for
presidential
candidates.
you
can
qualify
as
a
write-in
candidate
if,
prior
to,
i
believe
it
is
40
days
prior
to
the
general
election,
you
file
a
slate
of
electors
with
state
officials.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
past,
for
example,
in
lubin
and
panish,
that
the
write-in...
and
in
williams
and
rhodes,
that
the
write-in
alternative
is
not
an
equivalent,
a
practical
equivalent
either
for
voters
or
for
candidates
to
having
a
candidate's
name
on
the
ballot,
and
i
would
contend
that
that
is
particularly
so
for
someone
seeking
as
important
an
office
as
president
of
the
united
states.
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
write-in
alternative
and
the
ballot
access
alternative
serve
very
different
purposes.
the
state
is
saying
to
a
candidate
and
to
his
or
her
supporters,
if
you
can
demonstrate
substantial
community
support,
you
are
entitled
to
have
your
name
printed
on
the
ballot.
perhaps
the
major
party
candidates
get
some
ballot
preference,
but
the
independent's
or
third
party
candidate's
name
will
be
on
the
ballot.
the
state
is
also
saying
by
the
write-in
alternative,
we
are
not
going
to
totally
bar
everyone
else.
in
other
words,
regardless
of
whether
you
have
any
community
support,
we
will
allow
people
to
write
your
name
in
if
you
simply
go
through
some
administrative...
jump
through
some
administrative
hoops
near
to
the
election.
so
they
are
two
very
different
things.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
justice
o'connor,
i
think
we
are
certainly
asserting
the
right
of
petitioner
john
anderson
to
be
on
the
ballot
and
to
represent
these
people.
his
rights--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
court
treated
that
case
as
principally
a
case
asserting
the
candidate's
rights,
and
although
we
do
have
a
candidate
here
asserting
his
rights,
i
think
that
the
principal
rights
being
asserted
here
are
those
of
the
other
petitioners
and
voters
and
citizens
like
them.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
i
think
it
does,
but
i
think
the
voters
also
have
an
independent
right.
the
voters'
rights
that
are
being
infringed
here
are
the
rights
of
independents
and
other
voters
to
have
the
opportunity
during
this
five-month
period
when
party
supporters
have
an
opportunity
to
react
to
political
events
and
other
candidates'
choices,
and
in
late
august
to
be
able
to
choose
that
candidate
who
is
going
to
have
the
best
chance
to
win.
it
is
the
discrimination
between
the
rights
of
those
voters
to
put
forward
a
candidate,
the
party
and
the
independents.
now,
the
state
says
that
is
really
very
theoretical,
but
i
think
that
you
can
take
any
of
the
examples
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
from
political
history
and
demonstrate
that
the
same
thing
could
happen
in
1984,
that
would
discriminate
against
the
independent
voters.
for
example,
in
1968,
lyndon
johnson
shocked
the
country
by
announcing
in
late
march
that
he
was
not
going
to
run
for
re-election,
and
indeed
his
principal
opponent
at
that
time,
senator
robert
kennedy,
who
had
only
declared
two
weeks
earlier,
was
assassinated
in
early
june.
those
events
totally
changed
the
political
calculus.
now,
given
our
present
economic
situation
and
the
age
of
our
incumbent
president,
it
would
be
no
more
shocking
if
president
reagan
were
to
announce
on
april
24,
1984,
that
he
had
decided
not
to
run
for
re-election.
if
that
happened,
party
voters
and
party
supporters
would
have
months
to
react
and
still
choose
in
late
august
the
best
candidate
based
on
that
set
of
political
circumstances,
but
what
about
voters
who
elected
president
reagan
in
1980
because
of,
say,
his
views
on
supply
side
economics,
his
conservative
political
ideology?
those
people
who
assumed
on
march
20,
1984,
that
their
interests
would
be
represented
in
the
general
election,
because
they
would
vote
for
president
reagan
for
re-election,
now,
if
the
republican
party
were
not
going
to
nominate
someone
who
met
their
political
views,
they
would
be
forever
frozen.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
point
that
we
are
trying
to
make
in
our
case.
they
have
no
right
to
assume
that.
it
is
not
possible
to
tell
prior
to
early
summer
in
many
election
years
who
the
most
likely
candidates
are
going
to
be.
therefore,
there
is
no
meaningful
or
realistic
incentive
for
voters
to
organize
behind
an
independent
candidate
very
early
in
the
year
and
find
somebody
who
is
going
to
expend
the
necessary
energy
to
go
out
there
in
january
and
february
and
march
with
volunteers
in
50
states
and
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
don't
think
that
is
at
all
the
necessary
logic
of
our
position.
our
position
is
only
that
the
state
should
not
be
permitted
to
very
substantially
burden
and
discriminate
against
independents
by
making
them
qualify
much
earlier
than
the
party
candidates
absent
some
state
interest
that
the
legislature,
state
legislature
has
considered
and
made
a
determined
judgment
it
is
really
necessary
to
impose
this
burden.
for
example,
administrative
interests
of
the
state
of
ohio
on
the
face
of
its
statute
might
well
sustain
a
filing
deadline
here
in
early
june,
several
months
in
advance
of
the
party
conventions,
and
indeed
this
court
has
sustained
mid-june
deadlines.
so
we
are
not
arguing
that
independents
have
to
be
given
the
right
to
come
after
the
party
selections.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
when
you
have
a
process
that
lasts,
let's
say,
from
january
to
august,
throughout
the
country,
in
50
states,
in
which
the
voters,
party
and
independent
voters,
are
engaged
in
selecting
the
nominees
to
appear
on
the
ballot,
one
state
should
not
be
permitted
discriminatorily
to
say
to
independents
alone
that
if
you
don't
get
into
the
race
at
the
beginning
of
this
process,
you
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
in
at
all.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
which
reversed
the
district
court
appears
to
have
held
that
a
very
lenient
standard
of
review
is
appropriate.
although
it
is
our
position
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
mandate
strict
scrutiny
in
this
case,
we
think
that
even
with
the
most
lenient
standard
of
review,
that
the
statute
doesn't
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
as
applied
to
the
presidential
race.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
the
assumption
that
the
statute...
that...
the
assumption
would
be
that
congressman
anderson
could
constitutionally
be
barred
from
ohio's
general
election.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
but
it
seems...
sorry.
it
seems
to
me
that
assumption
would
be
that
the
state
could
have
passed
some
other
law,
such
as
a
disaffiliation
provision,
that
would
have
barred
it.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
well,
our
position,
i
think,
then...
my
answer
has
to
be
twofold.
one,
this
isn't
a
disaffiliation
provision.
it
is
not
a
political
stability
device.
and
second,
that
the
state
isn't
entitled
to
make
it
into
something
that
it
isn't.
and
then,
third,
that--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--well,
i
don't...
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
that
is
the
real
thrust
of
the
court's
overbreadth
opinions--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--if
congressman
anderson,
for
example,
were
contesting...
had
been
faced
with
an
850,000
petition
signature
requirement
in
june,
which
he
had
challenged
because
he
couldn't
get
the
correct
number
of
signatures,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
right
to
say
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
challenge
that
requirement
because
the
state
could
have
barred
him
with
some
kind
of
political
stability
device--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
our
position
has
always
been
that
it
has
to
be
considered
in
terms
of
its
impact
on
its
face--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--well,
our
position
is
that
even
if
a
rational
relationship
test
is
applied,
the
statute
falls,
because
it
isn't...
it
doesn't
in
fact
rationally
further
political
stability
goals.
it
doesn't,
for
example,
prevent
a
party
candidate
from
running
as
an
independent.
it
doesn't...
the
state
doesn't
prevent
by
the
filing
deadline
or
any
other
provision
a
person
who
has
been
a
long-time
independent
from
running
in
a
party
primary,
or
a
party
member
from
running
in
another
party's
primary,
or
a
candidate
from
filing
as
an
independent
in
the
presidential
race
and
going
on
and
continuing
to
run
as
a
party
candidate
in
every
other
state
in
the
country.
so
it
doesn't
in
fact
serve
any
of
the
political
stability
purposes
that
this
court
outlined
in
upholding
a
one-year
disaffiliation
clause
for
state
races
in
storer.
so
it
is
just
not
that
kind
of
device.
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
has
to
be
premised
on
the
state's
position
that
this
isn't
really
a
filing
deadline.
it
is
something
other
than
what
it
looks
like.
it
is
a
sheep
in
wolf's
clothing,
or
a
wolf
in
sheep's
clothing.
and
our
position
is,
it
is
not.
it
is
just
a
filing
deadline.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
or
how
the
statute
operates,
or
other
ways
in
which
you
look
at
a
statute
that
looks
like
one
thing
which
somebody
says
is
really
something
else,
all
of
those
show
you
that
it
isn't
something
else
in
disguise,
it
is
just
a
filing
deadline.
just
a
date
by
which
a
candidate
must
demonstrate
his
community
support.
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
shows
here,
if
we
have
to
go
to
that,
that
at
best
the
statute
is
an
accident.
it
is
something
designed
for
statewide
races
where
the
state
can
legitimately
say
everybody
who
wants
to
get
on
the
ballot
has
got
to
start
out
at
the
same
time,
and
nobody
gave
much
thought
to
the
fact
that
in
the
presidential
context
it
is
irrational.
at
worst,
it
is
a
leftover
part
of
an
exclusionary
scheme
that
this
court
recognized
in
williams
and
rhodes.
i
think
that
although
a
large
part
of
our
case
does
turn
on
discrimination,
that
we
would
have
an
equally
strong
case,
and
do
have
an
equally
strong
case
simply
flowing
from
the
burden
that
the
statute
imposes
on
independent
candidates
even
absent
the
discrimination.
the
burden
that
we
argue
is
tied
with
the
discrimination,
because
it
is
a
burden
on
the
competitive
exercise
of
rights.
you
can't
just
look
at
229
days
or
209
days.
you
have
to
look
at
what
independent
voters
can
do
vis-a-vis
what
everybody
else
is
permitted
to
do.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
there
is
evidence
that
a
number
of
independent
presidential
candidates
have
gotten
on
the
ballot,
but
it
is--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
it
is
stipulated
in
the
record,
i
don't
remember
the
paragraph
of
the
stipulation,
that
there
was
insufficient
information
available
from
either
the
state
government's
offices
or
from
any
other
source
that
we
had
available
in
the
district
court
to
make
a
determination
about
that.
even
if
ohio
had
a
non-discriminatory
statute,
that
is,
even
if
we
were
facing
a
statute
that
applied
equally
to--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
no,
we
are
suggesting
that
because
independent
candidates
and
voters
who
may
wish
to
put
forward
some
candidates
are
deprived
of
the
opportunity
during
most
of
the
time
everybody
else
chooses
their
nominees
from
doing
the
same
thing,
that
that
is
both
an
invidious
discrimination
and
a
burden.
but
even
if
the
difference
in
treatment...
i
am
sorry...
were
absent
from
the
case,
i
think
we'd
have
a
strong
case.
it
would
be
a
different
case
to
analyze,
because
then
the
question
would
be,
in
the
context
of
a
50-state
process,
where
other
states,
voters
in
other
states
are
choosing
the
nominees,
could
ohio
alone
take
the
position
that
no
candidate
who
had
not
thrown
his
name
into
the
ring
as
of
march
20th
was
going
to
get
on
ohio's
ballot
regardless
of
who
nominated
him.
now,
i
think
if
you
look
at
it
from
that
context,
that
that
would
be
a
very,
very
substantial
burden,
a
substantial
interference
by
ohio
in
the
political
process
nationwide.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
absolutely.
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
they
did,
that
i
wouldn't
be
here
alone
today,
that
the
republican
and
democratic
party
lawyers
would
be
here
urging
on
you
the
proposition
that
this
was
a
massive
infringement
on
their
rights
under
cousins
and
wigoda,
but
we
all
know
that
the
states
aren't
going
to
do
that.
they
are
not
going
to
do
it
because
they
are
not
going
to
buck
the
power
of
the
two
major
political
parties,
and
all
we
are
saying
in
this
case
is,
fine,
but
then
the
states
should
not
be
permitted,
having
made
that
choice,
to
go
ahead
and
just
buck
the
independents
who
simply
because
their
supporters
have
chosen
not
to
affiliate
with
an
ongoing
political
institution
between
elections
don't
have
the
political
organization
to
go
to
the
state
legislature
and
say,
don't
do
this
to
us.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
i
have
to
give
a
three-part
answer
to
that
question.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court,
although
it
is
not
a
separate
party,
of
course,
the
court
has
recognized
in
previous
decisions
that
independent-minded
voters,
those
people
who
for
whatever
reason
don't
want
to
affiliate
themselves
with
an
organized
ongoing
political
faction,
do
have
different
and
independent
type
of
rights
that
are
entitled
to
the
same
recognition
under
the
first
amendment
as
party
members.
now,
it
is
true
here
john
anderson
certainly
was
not
running
as
the
candidate
of
an
independent
party.
indeed,
his...
the
information
in
the
record
in
this
case
indicates,
and
the
district
court
found
that
he
was
an
unusual
situation.
he
was
drawing
support
from
the
major
parties
and
from
this
large
group
of
independent-minded
voters
whose
size
has
increased
over
the
last
decade
or
two.
but
i
think
that
their
rights,
the
rights
of
the
independent
voters,
whether
they
are...
the
rights
of
those
who
want
to
put
forward
some
alternative
to
the
major
parties,
be
they
independents
or
party
members,
are
the
same
if
they
are
barred
after
march
20
in,
for
example,
putting
forward
a
candidate
should
president
reagan
withdraw
in
'84.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
no,
our
position
still
is
that
the
burden
or
difference
in
treatment,
if
it
is
substantial,
has...
simply
saying
that
it
has
to
be
supported
by
some
state
interest.
now,
the
state
obviously...
states
obviously
do
have
interests
in
having
filing
deadlines
earlier
than
the
national
conventions.
of
course,
most
states
do
have
filing
deadlines
in
september--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--i
think
it
would
be
a
very
different
case,
because
ohio
does
have
legitimate
administrative
interests
that
might
support
a
june
deadline.
there
would
still
be
some
burden
and
some
difference
in
treatment,
albeit
a
lesser...
lesser
degree,
and
the
state
would
have
a
real
strong
state
interest.
for
example,
it
is
stipulated
here
that
even
independent
presidential
petitions
that
are
filed
by
march
20
sit
in
somebody's
in-box,
or
hopefully
a
safe,
gathering
dust
for
three
months,
until
mid-june.
in
mid-june,
the
state
does
begin
this
process
of
exposing
them
to
public
scrutiny,
verifying
them,
and
entertaining
challenges.
now,
i
think
if
this
were
a
june
12th
deadline,
supported
by
a
facially
valid
state
interest,
then
the
only
question...
the
only
kind
of
challenge
we
could
make
really
was
to
try
to
prove
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
state
really
didn't
need
two
and
a
half
months.
most
states
don't.
larger
states
than
ohio
don't.
but
that
would
be
a
pretty
heavy
burden
on
us.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
just
like
to
respond
to
one
question
asked
by
justice
stevens,
and
one
by
the
chief
justice
of
mr.
taylor.
i
don't
think
it's
just
the
6
percent
of
the
electorate
that
voted
for
congressman
anderson
in
the
november
election
whose
rights
are
burdened
here.
the
record
shows
and
the
district
court
found
that
as
of
the
time
this
lawsuit
was
brought,
the
poll
data,
for
whatever
that
is
worth,
showed
that
congressman
anderson
was
the
first
choice
of
some
place
between
23
and
44
percent
of
the
electorate.
i
think
that
is
a
very
significant
burden.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
nationwide.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
we
did
not
have
any
particular
statistics
from
ohio,
but
i
believe
those
polls
showed
that
his
strongest
support
came
from
eight
northeastern
states,
one
of
which
included
ohio.
it
didn't
break
it
out
beyond
that,
to
my
recollection.
the
burden
isn't
just
a
burden
that
narrows
the
range
of
candidates.
it
would
have
not
only
disqualified
these
people
from
voting
for
congressman
anderson,
but
from
putting
forward
any
independent
candidate
after
march
20.
the
chief
justice
asked
whether
any
third
force
candidate
had
ever
been
elected
president.
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
since
1948,
however,
three
former
presidents,
a
former
vice
president,
at
least
two
former
senators,
a
former
governor,
a
former
congressman
have
run
for
president
as
third
party
candidates
or
independent
candidates.
they
have
played
an
important
role
in
american
political
history,
but
it
has
mainly
been
a
role
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
and
in
their
impacts
on
the
major
parties.
they
haven't
won,
and
i
think
that
demonstrates
that
the
practical
and
political
barriers
to
independent
candidates
are
very
significant
by
themselves,
and
they
include
the
efforts
that
an
independent
has
to
go
through
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
50
different
states
under
50
different
sets
of
laws
which
customarily
have
exhausted
that
candidate
in
ballot
access
activities
rather
than
campaigning.
the
proposition
of
our
case
is,
those
burdens
are
high
enough.
the
state
should
not
be
permitted
discriminatorily,
without
a
considered
state
interest,
from
adding
additional
handicaps
to
the
independent
or
the
third
party
candidate
without
the
legislative
judgment
that
that
burden--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--i
use
the
phrase,
justice
brennan,
v.
oklahoma
case,
which
pertained
to
different
kinds
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
you
are
right,
justice
brennan.
in
addition
to
those
arguments,
we
also
contend
that
there
is
not
even
a
rational
relationship,
because
the
voters--
mr.
george
t.
frampton,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
