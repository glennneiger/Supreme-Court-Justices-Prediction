mr.
joel
s.
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
ohio
filing
deadline
at
issue
in
this
case
has
a
burden,
if
it
has
one
at
all,
of
an
entirely
different
character
than
the
election
regulations
that
have
been
struck
down
in
the
past
by
this
court.
it
does
not
result
in
a
prohibition
of
all
independent
candidacies
from
the
ohio
ballot,
nor
does
it
make
it
virtually
impossible
for
third
party
candidacies,
as
was
the
case
in
williams
v.
rhodes,
nor
does
this
filing
deadline
result
in
any
class
of
voters
being
totally
prohibited
from
voting
at
all,
as
was
the
case
in
dunn
against
blumstein,
the
tennessee
one-year
residency
case,
and
kramer
against
union
free
school
district,
where
classes
of
voters
were
prohibited
from
voting
at
all
in
a
particular
election.
the
burden
of
this
statute
is
indeed
even
less
than
the
burden
posed
by
statutes
which
have
been
upheld
by
this
court.
for
example,
this
filing
deadline
does
not
require
the
voter
to
make
up
his
mind
as
long
as
eleven
months
before
an
election
how
he
wishes
to
participate
in
that
election,
as
was
the
case
in
rosario
against
rockefeller,
in
which
a
party
enrollment
statute
in
new
york
was
upheld
that
required
enrollment
as
long
as
eleven
months
before
a
primary
election.
nor
does
this
statute
require
the
candidate
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
how
he
wishes
to
participate
in
an
election
as
long
as
one
year
before
that
election,
as
was
the
case
in
storer
v.
rhodes,
in
which
a
one-year
disaffiliation
requirement
was
upheld.
indeed,
all
this
statute
requires
is
that
a
person
seeking
the
office
of
president,
an
office
for
which
the
campaigns
frequently
begin
as
long
as
two
years
before
the
election,
make
up
his
mind
seven
and
a
half
months
before
that
election
that
he
wishes
to
seek
the
office
as
an
independent
candidate.
this,
i
would
submit,
is
not
much
of
a
burden.
i
would
like
to
stress
three
areas
in
my
argument.
number
one,
that
there
is
no
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case
between
independent
candidates
and
the
candidates
of
political
parties.
number
two,
the
statute
does
not
pose
a
substantial
burden
upon
any
constitutional
rights
for
the
class
of
independent
candidates,
and
therefore
strict
scrutiny
is
not
appropriate.
and
number
three,
it
is
in
fact
supported
by
important
state
interests.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
of
course,
any
candidate
restriction
is
going
to
have
some
kind
of
an
effect
on
voters,
and
i
think--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--right.
the...
any
restriction
on
a
candidacy
is
going
to
have
an
effect
on
voters
to
the
extent
that
if
the
candidate
does
not
comply
with
that
restriction,
whatever
it
is,
then
his
supporters
will
have
one
less
candidate
available
to
vote
for.
in
other
words,
any
candidate
restriction
is
going
to
narrow
the
field
to
some
extent
that
the
voter
has
available
to
him.
the
court
has
never
held
that
that
simple
narrowing
of
the
field
all
by
itself
is
enough
to
establish
an
infringement
of
rights.
indeed,
in
bullock
v.
carter
which...
in
which
the
issue
was
discussed
extensively,
the
court
in
that
case
relied
upon
a
factual
determination
that
indeed
many,
many
candidates
had
been
kept
off
the
ballot
by
the
high
filing
fees
in
the
state
of
texas
that
were
not
sustained
in
that
case.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
our
position--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--there
is
no
question
but
that
the
court
in
voting
rights
and
candidate
cases
has
recognized
the
implication
for
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
of
any
regulation.
the
simple
fact,
though,
that
the
regulation
may
affect
such
rights
does
not,
i
would
submit,
result
in
an
immediate
leap
to
the
conclusion
that
the
regulation
must
be
justified
by
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
indeed,
i
think
that
is
the
case,
justice
o'connor,
and
in
several
cases
the
court
has
done
exactly
that.
in
mandel
against
bradley,
for
example,
in
storer
v.
brown,
both
of
which
involved
a
numerical
petition
requirement,
in
both
cases
there
was
actually
a
remand
made
to
the
lower
courts
for
the
express
purpose
of
determining
as
a
factual
matter
whether
that
regulation
was
indeed
burdensome.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
one
state
currently
has
a
filing
deadline
earlier
than
ohio.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
i
believe
that
is
indiana.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
new
jersey,
i
believe,
has
one
in
april,
and
there
were,
of
course,
at
one
time
filing
deadlines
in
four
other
states
at
or
about
the
same
time
as
ohio's
that
were
struck
down
as
a
result
of
anderson
litigation
in
other
cases.
so
that
it
would
appear
that
at
least
seven
states
are
desirous
of
having
a
filing
deadline
at
or
about
this
time.
there
are,
of
course,
many
other
filing
deadlines
in
june
and
july
that
would
come
much
earlier
than
the
second
of
the
two
national
conventions.
and
i
think
indeed
that
petitioners'
position
does...
would
in
fact
require,
if
sustained,
the
invalidating
of
filing
deadlines
that
came
in
advance
of
the
national
conventions,
because
as
i
understand
his
argument,
it
is
clearly
that
the
voters
have
a
right
to
coalesce
around
an
independent
candidate
after
the
issues
have
been
determined
at
the
convention,
and
after
the
identities
of
the
major
parties'
nominees
are
known.
so
that
i
think
the
impact
of
this
case
would
be
much,
much
broader
than
simply
a
filing
deadline
that
occurs
in
the
spring.
turning
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
invidious
discrimination
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
discrimination
to
exist
simply
because
the
independent
candidate
must
file
his
petitions
in
march,
whereas
the
political
parties
remain
free
to
select
their
nominee
up
until
as
late
as
the
conventions
in
august.
there
is
a
fundamental
fallacy
in
making
this
argument.
there
is
an
assumption
that
is
not
merited
that
it
is
possible
to
compare
political...
it
is
possible
to
compare
the
candidates
seeking
the
nomination
of
a
political
party
with
independent
candidates.
in
ohio,
there
are
two
entities
that
have
a
right
of
access
to
the
ballot,
set
by
ohio
revised
code
section
3505.10.
one
of
those
is
a
political
party.
the
other
is
the
independent
candidate.
it
is
not
the
person
seeking
the
political
party
nomination
that
has
that
right
of
access
to
the
ballot.
it
is
the
party
that
has
that
right
of
access.
and
both
the
independent
candidate
and
the
political
party
must
take
steps
no
later
than
march
to
qualify
for
the
ballot.
in
the
case
of
the
political
party,
it
qualifies
either
by
attracting
a
certain
level
of
support
in
the
preceding
election
or
by
submitting
petitions
with
the
signatures
of
1
percent
of
the
people
who
voted
in
the
last
election.
in
the
case
of
the
independent
candidate,
he
qualifies
simply
by
submitting
the
nominating
petition.
at
that
point
in
time,
in
march,
then,
when
both
those
entities
have
qualified,
the
only
difference--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--the
two
entities
being
the
independent
candidate
and
the
political
party.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
there...
i
believe
the
last
time
we
had
a
third
party
on
the
presidential
ballot
was
in
1972.
we
have
had,
however,
five
independent
candidates
for
president
on
the
ballot
in
both
1976
and
1980.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
no,
he
could
not,
justice
marshall.
he
had
to
make
his
election
in
march
as
to
which
of
the
two
routes
he
wished
to
take
to
the
ballot.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
i
don't
believe
he
is
denied
any
right
to
run
in
the
convention.
he
is
simply
asked
to
make
an
election.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
the
state
of
ohio
is
not
telling
him...
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
to
prevent
congressman
anderson
from
having
obtained
the
nomination
of
the
republican
party
at
its
convention,
had
he
been
able
to
do
so.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
that's
correct.
i
mean,
the
person
who
is
put
on
the
ballot
as
the
candidate
of
the
political
party
is
whoever
that
political
party
selects.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
i
would
think
it
highly
unlikely.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
i
am
not
familiar
if
it
did
happen
in
california.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
at
the
point
in
time
in
march
then
when
those
two
entities
have
qualified
for
the
ballot,
the
difference
between
the
independent
candidate
and
the
political
party
is
simply
that
the
political
party
has
not
yet
named
the
person
who
is
going
to
carry
its
banner,
and
the
reason
for
that
goes
to
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
differences
between
political
parties
and
independent
candidacies.
the
independent
candidacy
is
a
candidacy
by
definition
built
around
a
single
individual
who
is
running
on
his
ideas,
his
principles,
and
his
beliefs.
the
political
party
obviously
has
a
much
broader
existence.
it
has
principles
beyond
those
of
the
individual
person.
it
has
a
continuing
program
of
electing
officials
that
extends
beyond
a
particular
election,
and
it
is
because
of
these
organizational
differences
between
the
political
party
and
the
independent
candidate
that
the
process
for
selecting
the
person
who
is
going
to
carry
the
political
party
banner
is
more
complicated
than
it
is
for
the
independent
candidate.
by
definition,
the
party
must
pick
and
choose
its
candidate,
and
it
does
that
through
the
system
of
primaries
and
conventions.
this
court
considered
whether
or
not
the
differences,
those
kinds
of
differences
between
political
parties
and
independent
candidates
might
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
in
jeness
against
fortson,
in
which
a
claim
was
in
fact
made
by
an
independent
candidate
that
there
was
invidious
discrimination
because
he
did
in
fact
have
to
file
his
petitions
and
qualify
for
the
ballot
that
way,
whereas
the
political
party
candidate
could
qualify
by
winning
the
primary
at
some
later
point
in
time.
the
court
in
rejecting
that
claim
indicated
that
these
were
simply
two
different
types
of
procedures,
and
that
it
is
not
possible
to
compare
political
parties
and
independent
candidates
for
all
purposes,
and
indeed,
that
the
grossest
discrimination
can
sometimes
lie
in
treating
things
that
are
different
as
though
they
were
the
same.
and
with
respect
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue
in
this
case,
ohio's
position
is
that
it
is
simply
not
appropriate
to
compare
those
two
very
different
routes
to
the
ballot.
however,
even
accepting
the
premise
offered
by
petitioner
for
the
moment,
and
assuming
that
one
can
make
an
attempt
to
compare
the
individuals
who
seek
political
party
nomination
with
the
independent
candidates,
we
still
believe
no
invidious
discrimination
can
be
shown,
and
that
is
for
this
reason.
the
independent
candidates
are
required
to
file
for
the
ballot
on
the
same
date
in
march
as
those
party
candidates
who
are
seeking
delegates
to
the
national
conventions.
the
burden
posed
on
each
is
the
same
or
arguably
even
more
burdensome
for
the
party
candidate,
and
i
should
add
here
that
it
is
indeed
clear
in
ohio
that
it
is
the
party
candidate
who
is
seeking
these
delegates.
it
is
the
party
candidate's
name
who
goes
on
the
ballot.
he
must
give
his
written
consent
to
all
the
delegates
that
file
petitions
on
his
behalf,
and
indeed,
he
even
has
the
right
to
determine
the
order
in
which
delegates
are
selected.
so
that
it
is
indeed
a
case--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--well--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--the
arguments...
the
argument
is
an
alternative
argument,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
it
is
an
argument
that
says
we
don't
think
that
it's
possible
to
make
this
comparison,
but
even
assuming--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
the
burden...
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
look
to
the
burden
that
each
type
of
candidate
faces
in
march.
the
burden
in
march
is,
if
anything,
even
at
that
point
in
time,
forgetting
everything
that
comes
after
march,
if
anything,
more
severe
on
the
party
candidate.
the
party
candidate
has
to
file--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--well,
there
are
indeed
reasons,
and
we
have
advanced,
i
think,
three
of
them
in
our
brief,
for
that
different
treatment
between
the
two
candidates.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
yes,
it
does.
and
as
mr.
frampton
indicated,
it
would
require
filing,
i
believe,
40
days
before
the
election
a
notice
of
intention.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
on
the
part
of
the
write-in
candidate.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
well,
it
can
be
done
in
ohio,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
a
physical
sense,
in
the
sense
that
we
have
it
happen
all
the
time,
too,
that
people
do
that,
but
i
think
the
consequence
is,
if
you
haven't
filed
a
notice
of
intention,
that
the
ballots
may
not
be
counted.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
no,
i
don't
believe
any
third
party
candidate
has
ever
been
elected.
returning
to
the
question
of
whether
we
are
treating
the
political
party
candidates
and
the
independent
candidates
equally,
the
burden
at
the
point
in
time
in
march
on
the
independent
candidate
is
to
file
5,000
petition
signatures.
the
burden
on
the
political
party
candidate
through
his
delegates
is
to
file
something
in
excess
of
4,000
signatures,
slightly
less,
on
behalf
of
his
delegate
slate,
but
on
the
other
hand,
those
signatures
can
come
only
from
persons
who
are
members
of
that
political
party,
unlike
with
respect
to
the
independent
candidate,
and
there
is
a
geographical
distribution
requirement
with
respect
to
some
of
those
signatures.
so
that
if
anything,
the
burden
on
the
party
candidate
is
more
at
that
point
in
time.
at
that
point
in
time,
the
independent
candidate
has
done
everything
he
needs
to
do
to
qualify
for
the
ballot.
it
is
after
that
point
in
time
that
the
parties
have
the
more
difficult
process.
so
that
the...
we
are
not
requiring
anything
more
from
the
two
types
of
candidates
in
march
of
any
year.
indeed,
the
situation
is
that
they
are
required
to
do
about
the
same,
but
after
that
date
it
is
a
much
more
lengthy
and
burdensome
process
for
the
party
to
select
its
candidate.
there
has--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--well,
in
several
ways,
justice
o'connor.
as
a
factual
matter,
we
have
in
fact
had
many
candidates
qualify
as
independent
candidates
for
president
on
our
ballot,
so
that
there
is
a
choice
and
has
been
a
choice
under
our
system.
indeed,
five
candidates
in
each
of
the
last
two
elections
for
the
independent
voters--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
case,
and
the
petitioner
produced
none,
to
show
that
we
have
ever
had
that
kind
of
a
problem
with
the
ohio
filing
deadline,
and
we
would
indeed
submit,
and
the
sixth
circuit,
i
think,
found
that
the
most
likely
impact
of
this
filing
deadline
is
with
respect
to
a
candidate
such
as
anderson,
who
had
no
trouble
at
all
making
up
his
mind
that
he
wanted
to
seek
the
presidency,
but
simply
wished
to
switch
horses
in
the
middle
of
the
stream.
as
a
factual
matter,
there
is
simply
no
evidence
of
any
burden
on
independent
candidates
in
this
case,
and
i
would
submit
the
hypothetical--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--that's
correct.
it
did.
but
of
course
any
time,
any
time
you
have
a
ballot
regulation,
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
be
somebody
who
didn't
comply
with
it.
if
in
fact
that
were
the
only
criteria
for
determining
whether
we
have
enough
of
a
burden
so
that
we
have
to
meet
tests
like
strict
scrutiny,
we
would
have
it
in
every
case--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--because
the
plaintiff
is
invariably
somebody
who
hasn't
met
the
requirement,
whatever
it
is.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
situation
that
the
political
party
voter
finds
himself
in
in
august,
at
the
time
of
his
conventions,
we
find
it
is
not
really
any
different
than
the
voter
for
the
independent
candidate.
let's
assume,
for
example,
at
the
time
of
the
convention
that
a
substantial
block
of
persons
within
a
major
political
party
is
dissatisfied
with
all
the
candidates
that
have
been
produced
through
the
primaries
and
the
conventions,
and
would
like...
they
don't
want
to
bolt
the
party,
but
they
would
like
to
coalesce
around
a
different
candidate
within
the
party.
well,
they
are
under
the
same
kind
of
disability
that
the
independent
candidate
is.
the
field
of
candidates
is
narrowed
in
the
spring.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
view
our
statute
in
the
context
of
the
way
the
presidential
election
occurs
in
this
country,
and
indeed,
that
is
critical
to
an
understanding
of
this
alternative
equal
protection
argument,
because
there
has
been
a
fundamental
change
in
the
method
of
selection
of
the
presidential
candidates
that
occurred
just
prior
to
the
time
that
ohio
adopted
this
filing
deadline.
the
political
commentators
who
have
written
on
this
subject
in
the
last
two
or
three
years,
and
we
cite
six
of
them
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
are
unanimous
in
their
declaration
that
a
fundamental
change
occurred
after
the
1968
presidential
election
such
that
we
switched
from
basically
a
brokered
convention
system
to
a
system
that
results
in
the
nominees
of
the
parties
being
selected
through
the
primaries.
and
those
commentators
are
unanimous
in
their
view
that
any
party
candidate
who
wishes
to
seek
the
nomination,
if
he
is
serious
about
it
at
all,
has
to
go
after
it
in
this
day
and
age
in
the
primary,
and
that
means
in
turn
that
the
candidate
has
to
be
seeking
delegates
to
the
convention
through
the
primary
election
system,
so
that
the
party
candidates
in
ohio
are
going
to
be
in
there
filing
their
petitions
and
making
their
decision
to
go
for
office
at
the
same
time
as
the
independent
candidate.
i
think
it
is
a
myth
to
talk
about
candidates
arising
as
late
as
august
with
one
possible
exception,
and
that
is
if
you've
got
an
extreme
situation
like
the
death
of
a
candidate
or
a
sudden
withdrawal,
but
most
of
the
time,
indeed
probably
more
than
90
percent
of
the
time,
we
are
going
to
have
a
situation
where
the
people
that
want
this...
the
office
of
president
are
in
there
at
the
same
time
in
ohio
fighting
for
it.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
we
have...
we
are
asserting
basically
three
interests
in
having
what
we
view
as
a
simultaneous
filing
deadline
for
party
candidates
and
independent
candidates.
the
first
is
that
we
think
it
promotes
the
equal
treatment
of
those
candidates.
the
interest
that
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
discussed
most
extensively
was
the
interest
in
what
it
called
voter
education,
and
the...
having
those
joint
filing
deadlines
serves
that
interest
in
this
way.
the
presidential
campaigns
have
begun
earlier
and
earlier,
if
anything,
in
recent
years,
and
we
find
the
voters
buffeted
by
exploratory
committees,
and
rumors,
and
it
is
a
confused
situation.
the
requirement
that
those
persons
who
are
serious
about
pursuing
that
nomination
in
ohio
file
something
at
the
same
time
in
march
that
says
who
they
are
really
serves,
i
think,
a
couple
of
different
voter
education
interests.
it
enables
those
people...
it
basically
puts
the
voter
in
the
position
of
understanding
what
his
options
are
in
the
spring.
i
mean,
if,
for
example,
he
wants
to
commit
a
certain
amount
of
money
to
political
campaigns,
he
knows
that
his
alternative
is
this
group
of
independents
or
these
people
within
the
political
party.
if
he
wants
to
decide
to
work
for
a
candidate,
he
has
got
all
his
options
in
front
of
him.
he
knows
who
is
going
to
be--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--what
i
am
urging--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
is
fair
to
adjudge
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
in
light
of
the
way
the
presidential
election
system
works.
i
am
not
talking
simply
about
political
theory.
i
am
talking
about
laws
that
have
been
changed--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--well,
without
inquiring
as
to
what
that
situation
is,
the
argument
is--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--the
argument
is
simply
that
as
a
practical
matter,
the
candidates
who
are
seeking--
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
--well,
the...
your
honor,
as
long
ago
as
pullman
v.
knott,
justice
holmes
indicated
that
an
equal
protection
issue
should
not
be
decided
upon
a
hypothetical
state
of
facts,
and
i
think
that
the
situation
that
is
being
posed
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
largely
a
hypothetical
state
of
facts.
he
does
not
represent
one
of
these
late
emerging
candidacies
at
the
time
of
the
conventions
in
august.
he
represents
someone
who
had
no
trouble
at
all
making
up
his
mind
that
he
wanted
to
run
for
president,
but
simply
chose
what
he
later
decided
to
be
the
wrong
method.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
what
i
am
saying
is
that
he
decided,
i
think,
in
this
case
as
early
as
june,
1979,
that
he
wished
the
republican...
or
that
he
wished
to
become
president.
having
made
that
decision,
in
ohio
he
had
to
decide
by
march
20th
whether
he
wished
to
seek
it
on
an
independent...
as
an
independent
or
through
the
political
party
system.
he
chose
the
political
party
system,
decided
it
was
a
mistake,
and
tried
to
switch.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
door
is
not
completely
closed.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
i
don't
know
that
figure,
justice
marshall.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
i
am
sure
that
if
anyone
filed
with
a
40-day
notice,
they
were
counted,
but
i
can't
tell
you
off
the
top
of
my
head.
it
is
undoubtedly
not
a
large
number.
i
mean,
no
one
is
going
to
contend
that
it
is.
i
would
like
to
turn
quickly
in
the
remaining
minute
or
two
to
one
of
the
things
that
was
raised
by
the
petitioner
in
his
statement,
and
that
is
the
effect
of
the
withdrawal
from
the
ballot,
from
ohio's
republican
ballot
made
by
congressman
anderson
in
this
case.
he
withdrew
from
the
ballot
under
a
section
3513.30
that
specifically
allows
presidential
candidates
to
withdraw
from
the
ballot
up
to
30
days
before
the
deadline.
we
had
contended
in
our
answering
brief
in
this
case
that
the
purpose
of
that
statute
was
simply
to
avoid
voter
confusion
on
election
day.
in
the
reply
brief,
petitioner
indicates
that,
no,
that
was
not
the
reason
for
it
at
all.
the
reason
for
it
was
to
avoid
what
would
otherwise
be
the
applicability
of
ohio's
so-called
sore
loser
statute.
the
petitioner
is
simply
incorrect
in
this
contention.
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history
for
section
3513.30,
which
was
enacted
in
house
bill
1245
in
1976,
a
bill
that
dealt
only
with
this
subject,
we
find
that
that
bill
became
effective
in
april,
right
before
the
primary
date.
it
was
enacted
as
an
emergency
measure
to
get
it
immediately
effective
under
ohio
law,
which
requires
a
higher
vote
than
a
normal
bill.
the
reason
stated
for
the
bill
in
that
emergency
clause
was
to
spare
the
voters
of
ohio
the
confusion
of
having
on
the
ballot
the
names
of
persons
who
no
longer
wished
to
be
candidates,
and
the
expense
of
counting
ballots
for
such
persons.
so,
indeed,
that
statute
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
avoiding
the
sore
loser
provision.
the
sore
loser
provision
has
been
stipulated
to
be
inapplicable
in
this
case.
it
may
or
may
not
be
inapplicable
because
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
withdrawal.
it
is
clearly
inapplicable
because
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself,
it
does
not
apply
in
the
presidential
election,
as
the
sixth
circuit
noted
in
footnote
3
of
its
opinion.
thank
you.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
the
third
is
the
political
stability
interest
that
i
have
just
touched
upon.
mr.
joel
s.
taylor
thank
you.
