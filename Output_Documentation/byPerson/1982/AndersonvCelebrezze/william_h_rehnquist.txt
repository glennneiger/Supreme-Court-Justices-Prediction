rehnquist
well,
what
business
would
those
people
have
for
assuming
in
your
hypothetical
situation
that
president
reagan
would
run
again.
if
he
simply
had
remained
silent,
and
there
had
been
no
party
conventions.
those
are
the
ones
that
nominate.
they
are
simply
waiting
like
everybody
else
to
see
what
happens.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
logic
of
your
position
suggests
that
if
the
major
party
conventions
were
held
in
late
august
and
september,
and
the
candidates
nominated
only
then,
and
although
that
isn't
the
tradition,
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
law
that
prevents
it,
your
people
would
still
have
a
right
after
that
happens,
however
late
or
however
few
days
left
before
election,
your
people
would
still
have
a
right
to
act
after
the
major
parties
in
order
to
put
their
candidate
up,
and
i
don't
see
where
you
get
that
out
of
our
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
i
think
it
is
also
true
that
the
ohio...
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
ohio
legislature,
with
republicans
and
democrats
making
up
98
percent
of
it,
would
pass
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
of
course,
you...
in
a
sense,
for
seem
to
be
arguing
that
independents
are
a
sort
of
political
party
all
their
own,
and
of
course
if
that
were
true,
i
think
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
ohio
saying
that
if
you
want
the
independent
nomination,
you
have
got
to
file
by
a
certain
date,
and
the
independents
choose
their
candidate
at
the
independent
convention,
and
such
and
such.
but
that
really
isn't
what
the
independent
is.
it
isn't
a
third
political
party.
it
is
just
people
who
don't
affiliate
with
the
two
major
parties,
and
who
kind
of
go
in
and
out
from
one
campaign
to
the
next.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
realize
i
was
bringing
that
on.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
argument
necessarily
requires
you
to
say,
doesn't
it,
that
even
though
the
major
parties
have
their
conventions
in
august,
that
nonetheless
if
someone
like
congressman
anderson
wishes
to
announce
in
september
on
the
basis
of
choices
made
by
the
major
parties
in
august,
ohio
has
got
to
allow
them
to
do
it,
however
it
may
foul
up
their
balloting.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
a
filing
deadline
in
june
for
independents
have
done
away
with
your
constitutional
objections,
do
you
think?
because
the
same
sort
of
thing
that
congressman
anderson
relied
on
in
april
could
have
occurred
as
a
result
of
the
two
major
party
conventions
in
august.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
both
those
entities,
mr.
taylor,
what
do
you
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose...
are
there
customarily
more
than
two
political
party
candidates
for
president
on
the
ballot
in
ohio?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
vote
for
them,
but
they
won't
be
counted.
i
was
just
wondering
if
anybody
had
ever
gotten
elected.
has
any
third
party
candidate
ever
been
elected,
since
we
have
had
parties?
