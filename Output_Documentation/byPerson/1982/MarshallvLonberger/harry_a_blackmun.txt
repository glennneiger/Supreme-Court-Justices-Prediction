justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
drake,
twice
you've
referred
to
the
sixth
circuit
as
doing
this
sua
sponte.
i
detect
a
criticism
there.
a
criticism
of
what...
not
having
a
hearing
or
something?
what
is
your
concern
about
the
sua
sponte?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suspect
on
many
remands
from
here
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
another
case
the
courts
of
appeal
would
do
precisely
this.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
drake,
incidentally,
is
there
any
indication
in
the
ohio
record
why
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
refused
to
accept
lonberger's
offer
to
stipulate
to
the
prior
conviction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
state
interest
involved
in
that
refusal
that
you
can
identify?
