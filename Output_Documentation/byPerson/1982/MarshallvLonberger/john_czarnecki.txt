mr.
john
czarnecki
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin,
i
guess,
by
extending
mr.
drake's
argument.
justice
stevens,
you're
correct.
the
stipulation
offered
by
mr.
lonberger
in
this
case
was
unqualified.
it
was
designed
only
to
withdraw
that
issue
from
the
jury,
and
in
fact,
it
was
one
of
four
opportunities
we
afforded
the
state
at
trial
to
withdraw
this
particular
claim
or
this
particular
charge
from
the
jury.
we
filed
initially...
upon
the
filing
of
the
ohio
indictment
we
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
making
the
claims
we
make
here
today.
that
motion
was
overruled
by
the
trial
court
after
a
hearing.
we
then
moved
the
court
for
a
bifurcated
procedure,
and
that
in
fact...
justice
o'connor
asked
the
question...
would
have
had
the
effect
of
keeping
this
particular
issue
out
of
the
guilt-innocence
phase.
it
would
have
put
this
issue
squarely
before
the
jury
only
after
they
had
reached
a
decision
on
guilt
or
innocence.
and
it
was
our
position
then
and
it
remains
our
position
now
that
the
state
would
suffer
no
detriment
by
accepting
that
proposal,
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
not
guilty,
the
specification
under
ohio
law
would
have
become
irrelevant.
mr.
john
czarnecki
no.
that's
correct.
and,
in
fact,
spencer
v.
texas
addresses
that
question
precisely.
i
was
simply
addressing
justice
stevens'
question
on
the
stipulation.
the
state
in
its
argument
seems
to
cast
great
doubt
on
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
herein.
the
sixth
circuit
reviewed
the
entire
record.
it
began,
as
the
state
court
did,
with
a
facially
invalid
conviction
from
illinois.
one
ordinarily
presents
a
conviction
statement
to
prove
a
prior
conviction.
this
conviction
statement
said,
among
other
things,
robert
lonberger
has
been
convicted
of
the
offense
of
aggravated
battery,
et
cetera.
robert
lonberger
has
been
given
one
sentence,
two
to
four.
that
conviction
statement
was
concededly
ineffective
to
prove
that
anyone
had
been
convicted
of
the
offense
of
attempted
murder.
the
invalidity
or
the
insufficiency
of
that
statement
can
be
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
state
was
forced
to
go
outside
the
record,
outside
the
normal
channel
of
proof--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--it
was
certainly
invalid
to
show
a
conviction
for
attempted
murder.
mr.
john
czarnecki
the
conviction
statement
itself,
your
honor,
was
facially
invalid.
mr.
john
czarnecki
well,
simply
stated,
it
did
not
say
that
robert
lonberger
had
been
convicted
of
attempted
murder,
period.
i
mean
it
said,
the
conviction
statement
simply
said
he'd
been
convicted
of
aggravated
battery,
et
cetera,
in
quotations,
that
phrase
literally.
so
that
certainly
the
state
could
not
have
introduced
that
to
a
jury
and
expected
them
to
find
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--i
would
think
that
it
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
constitutional
invalidity,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
the
court's
question.
if
in
fact
the
conviction
itself
was
invalid,
yes,
that
invalidity
arises
from
a
constitutional
deprivation.
i'm
sorry.
i
was
referring
to
the
conviction
statement,
the
document
that
ordinarily
proves
a
conviction.
in
this
case
it
was
insufficient.
the
state
then
went
outside
the
record
with
the
testimony
that
was
taken
at
the
change
of
plea
and
sentencing
hearing.
and
notwithstanding
what
the
state's
position
is,
the
trial
judge
in
illinois
simply
said
you
are
pleading
guilty
that
you
did
commit
the
offense
of
aggravated
battery,
and
you
did
attempt
on
the
victim.
mr.
lonberger's
position
has
been
unwavering.
his
position
was
that
he
understood
he
was
entering
a
plea
to
aggravated
battery
and
that
the
phrase
relating
to
an
attempt
provided
the
factual
backdrop
for
that
plea.
there
is
no
other
factual
information
in
the
record
to
support
a
plea
of
aggravated
battery.
his
position
is
credible
on
its
face.
the
sixth
circuit
simply
found,
simply
stated,
that
the
ohio
trial
court
without
more
could
not
hold
that
the
state
of
ohio
had
borne
its
burden
to
sustain
the
validity
of
a
conviction
that
it
sought
to
use
on
the
face
of
the
record
presented.
mr.
john
czarnecki
i'm
not
sure
that
i'd
like
to
read
that
into
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion.
mr.
john
czarnecki
as
an
observation
that
the
facts
that
they
were
finding
need
not
be
given
the
deference
that
2254(d)
normally
requires.
mr.
john
czarnecki
the
sixth
circuit?
i
would
suspect
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
well,
i
would
distinguish
that
case,
your
honor,
in
that
that
was
a
case
remanded
with
specific
instructions;
that
was
a
case
remanded
with
a
specific
legal
standard
to
be
applied;
and
that
the
question
to
be
answered
by
the
state
court
was
fairly
clear
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
justice
o'connor
asked
the
question
during
argument,
and
i
had
intended
to
get
to
it
later
in
my
argument,
but
i
will
now.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing,
your
honor,
on
the
strength
of
the
state
court
finding
either
what
standard
he
found
or
he
applied
or
what
facts
he
found.
in
fact,
it's
entirely
possible
that
the
state
court
found,
having
made
specific
findings
that
this
defendant
was
intelligent...
and
that's
questionable...
that
he
was
well
represented
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
by
competent
and
capable
counsel,
that
he
was
well
experienced
in
the
criminal
process,
and
that
every
effort
was
taken
to
protect
his
constitutional
rights,
may
well
have
found
that
those
four
facts
justified
a
finding,
a
conclusion
of
law
that
the
plea
was
intelligent
and
voluntary,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
court
may
have...
and
we
are
forced
to
speculate
in
the
face
of
a
silent
record...
the
court
may
have
found
he
neither
had
notice...
and
that's
conceded,
i
believe...
nor
actual
knowledge
from
henderson.
we
simply
have
no
way
of
knowing.
the
sixth
circuit
reviewed
the
record
and
found,
i
think
properly,
that
the
record
presented
did
not
support
the
trial
court's
finding
that
this
plea
was
voluntary.
in
the
event,
your
honor,
on
the
question
of
2254(d)
in
sumner
versus
mata,
this
court
held
last
term
in
the
second
remand
of
sumner
that
sumner
in
2254(d)
did
not
apply
to
mixed
findings
of
fact
and
law,
and
i
think
it's
beyond
argument
that
the
validity
of
confessions,
the
validity
of
pleas
are
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law,
that
the
federal
courts
are
certainly
free
to
apply
federal
constitutional
standards
to
historic
facts
found.
they
are
free
to
give
certain
credence
and
certain
weight
to
facts
found.
mr.
john
czarnecki
i
would
find
that
very
difficult
to
support,
your
honor.
yes.
because
the
trial
court
certainly
had
an
opportunity
to
view
the
defendant's
demeanor.
the
question,
however,
transcends
that
simple
question.
mr.
longberger
was
subjected
to
cross
examination
for
the
better
part
of
a
day.
he
was
absolutely
firm
in
his
representations
that
he
did
not
know.
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
objective
evidence
presented
by
the
state
to
show
that
this
plea
was,
in
fact,
a
knowledgeable,
voluntary
plea.
the
state--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--your
honor,
mr.
lonberger's
explanation
is
not
the
explanation
of
11
lawyers.
it's
an
exclamation
that
i
didn't
know,
i
simply
didn't
understand
that
he--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--at
the
risk
of
appearing
to
be
engaging
levity,
your
honor,
we
have
to
also
ignore
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
could
not
have
taken
this
plea.
i
think
it's
clear
the
state
in
this
case,
in
the
ohio
case
and
the
case
before
the
bar
today,
does
not
contest
the
fact
that
this
plea
was
probably
legally
invalid
in
any
event.
it
is
no
more
unlikely
that
robert
lonberger
didn't
understand
that
the
judge
thought
he
was
taking
a
plea
to
attempted
murder
than
it
is
that
the
judge
didn't
understand
that
he
could
not
have
taken
pleas
for
attempted
murder
and
aggravated
battery
arising
out
of
the
same
operative
facts.
the
law
is
absolutely
clear
in
illinois
that
the
offense
of
aggravated
battery
is
subsumed
into
the
greater
offense
of
attempted
murder.
if
one
looks
at
the
sentence
i
think
that
supports
my
client's
position.
the
sentence
is
for
a
single
charge.
my
criminal
practice
is
a
regular
one,
and
i
have
never
seen,
or
stood
before
a
court
and
entered
a
plea
or
had
a
client
convicted
for
more
than
one
offense
when
the
court
did
not
acknowledge
that
fact
at
the
time
of
sentencing
and
make
sentences
consecutive,
make
sentences
concurrent,
dismissed,
suspend.
but
this
case
supports
this
client's...
on
the
facts...
supports
this
client's
position
that
he
simply
didn't
know.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
anyone
knew
what
this
plea
connoted.
i'm
not
sure
that
anybody
had
read
this
court's
opinion
in
boykin
and
spread
upon
the
record
a
clear
understanding
from
the
court
to
this
defendant.
if
this
court
today
accepts
the
state's
position
it
is
approving
this
sort
of
sloppy
plea-taking,
this
sort
of
sloppy
procedure
before
the
state
courts.
this
finding
in
illinois
and
this
finding
in
ohio,
neither
one
of
should
be
accorded
the
sort
of
deference
that
a
careful
factfinding,
a
careful
legal
process,
would
require.
the
second
argument
that
the
petitioners
make
goes
to
the
question
of
good
faith
admission
and
harmless
error
and
the
limiting
instruction
from
spencer.
in
the
first
place,...
and
i
don't
want
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
on
it...
this
case
was
not
one
of
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt.
mr.
drake--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
the
significance
of
the--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--yes,
of
the
harmless
error
made
by
the
state
is
important.
i
think
that
the
state
utilized
his
prior
conviction
to
secure
a
conviction
in
a
case
that
was
otherwise
one
of
insubstantial
circumstantial
evidence.
the
spencer
court,...
and
i
think
it's
significant
that
the
spencer
court,
when
it
discussed
limiting
instructions
and
the
importance
of
limiting
instructions,
also
predicated
that
finding
on
a
ruling
that
found
in
spencer
that
prior
convictions
are
ordinarily
not
inflammatory,
ordinarily
introduced
pure
documentary
evidence.
mr.
john
czarnecki
yes,
sir,
i
absolutely
do.
mr.
john
czarnecki
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
they
are
perfectly
reconcilable.
mr.
john
czarnecki
yes.
mr.
john
czarnecki
spencer,
as
i
began
to
say,
first
noted
that
limiting
instructions...
i
think
one
has
to
back
up
a
moment
and
analyze
spencer
in
its
entirety.
spencer
began
with
the
premise
that
this
court
and
the
federal
system
generally
is
not
in
the
business
of
structuring
criminal
procedures
for
the
states;
a
position
that
i
certainly
agree
wholeheartedly
with.
it
then
went
on
to
suggest
that
states,
quite
uniformly,
have
enacted
recidivism
statutes
to
address
a
reoccurring
problem.
having
made
those
two
holdings,
then
the
court
acknowledged
prejudice.
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
spencer
must
of
necessity
lead
one
to
the
conclusion
that
the
court
acknowledged
prejudice
flowing
to
a
defendant
from
the
admission
of
prior
crimes
evidence.
but
said
that
because
that
admission
is
normally
not
inflammatory,
is
normally
cured
by
a
limiting
instruction,
that
in
a
balance
we're
going
to
allow
that
procedure.
burgett,
your
honors,
is
much
different.
burgett
is
entirely
different
than
spencer
because
burgett
is...
the
prior
conviction
in
burgett
was
predicated
upon
an
invalid
prior
conviction,
and
the
state's
representation--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--in
both
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
the
ohio
courts
have
held
prior
convictions
to
be
elements.
mr.
john
czarnecki
prior
convictions
in
recidivism
cases,
ohio
has
a
number
of
statutes
which,
for
instance,
the--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--the
trial
court
had
held
that
it
was
an
element.
mr.
john
czarnecki
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
czarnecki
no,
it
isn't.
mr.
john
czarnecki
your
honor,
in
burgett,
just
as
in
this
case,
the
validity
of
the
prior
conviction
was
raised
apparently
mid-trial.
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
opinion
about
exactly
what
happened.
but
in
any
event,
the
trial
judge
found
the
prior
conviction
to
be
invalid
and
withdrew
it,
as
the
state
has
already
told
us,
from
the
jury's
consideration
so
that
it
played
no
part
in
the
enhanced
penalty.
it
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
to
suggest
that
mr.
longberger's
conviction
was
reversed
on
appeal,
and
therefore,
his
prior
conviction
played
no
part.
burgett
also
was
not
sentenced
as
a
recidivist,
your
honor,
was
not
convicted
as
a
recidivist.
i
think
that
burgett
is
indistinguishable.
i
think
that
this
court
has
to
directly
overrule
burgett
unless
it
is--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
opinion
supports
the
state's
position
on
that
issue.
it...
the
case
of
boykin
said
that
invalid
pleas
are
to
be
considered
in
much
the
same
way
that
6th
amendment
deprivations
are
to
be
considered;
that
the
state
cannot
rely
upon
a
valid
waiver
of
constitutional
rights
in
the
face
of
a
silent
record.
i
fail
to
be
able
to
distinguish
an
invalid
plea,
which
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
factfinding
process,
from
a
6th
amendment
violation
which,
if
anything,
maybe
a
less
important
right.
the
6th
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
a
facilitating
right.
it
is
a
right
guaranteed
by
our
constitution
to
insure
that
other
6th
amendment
rights,
the
rights
to
notice
of
the
charge
among
other
things,
are
guaranteed.
i
cannot
denigrate
an
invalid,
unknowledgeable
plea
to
some
subsidiary
status,
to
that
of--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--i'm
not
sure
that
it
did,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--because
it
was
a
mixed
finding,
certainly
a
mixed
finding
of
fact
and
law.
mr.
john
czarnecki
it
exempted
from
the
application
of
2254--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--under
the
second
decision
of
this
court
in
sumner
versus
matta
last
term,
the
memo
opinion
remanding
the
case
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
court
agreed
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
mixed
questions
of
fact
and
law
are
not
covered
by
the
presumption
of
validity
contained
in
2254(d).
mr.
john
czarnecki
the
federal
courts
have
regularly,
your
honor,
assigned
constitutional
significance
to
given
facts.
that
has
been
the
function--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--i
think
that
argument
could
be
made,
your
honor.
it
need
not
be
made
in
this
case
because--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--because
the
sixth
circuit
expressly
said
that
it
disagrees
with
the
factual
finding
of
the
ohio
court.
it
found
that
the
ohio
court
could
not,
on
the
record,
find
either
notice
or
knowledge
of
the
plea.
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
make
the
argument
that
as
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
the
sixth
circuit
need
not
give
deference,
but
i
think
it's
irrelevant
here.
i
think
the
court
fulfilled--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
heart
of
2254--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--because,
your
honor,
it
would
have
been...
i'm
bemused
by
the
fact
that
the
court
made
certain
factual
findings
which
are,
in
my
view,
irrelevant
to
the
central
question.
if,
as
the
state
points
out,
the
issue
was
as
clear
as
they
represent,
then
it
would
have
seemed
that
the
trial
court
could
have
simply
said
the
defendant
had,
on
the
strength
of
the
record,
actual
knowledge
of
the
charge
made
against
him.
but
the
court
did
not.
it
made,
however,
four
other
findings
that
in
our
view
are
irrelevant
to
the
central
question.
it
did
not
address
the
central
question.
mr.
john
czarnecki
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
that
the
state...
even
assuming
arguendo
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
believe
robert
longberger...
i
am
not
willing
to
suggest
that
a
state
court
could,
without
any
other
evidence,
on
an
issue
as
crucial
as
this,
hold
that
the
state
has
borne
a
heavy
burden,
a
burden
that
some
of
the
circuits
have
characterized
as
requiring
clear
and
convincing
evidence,--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
no,
i
do
not.
i
didn't.
if
the
court...
and
i
don't
know
if
that's
anymore
significant.
i
think
the
court
should
review
the
record.
review
the
record
that
the
state
court
found
intelligence
on.
and
i
won't
comment
upon
this
defendant's
intelligence
beyond
to
suggest,
as
i
have
in
my
reply
brief,
that
post-conviction,
psychological
testing
showed
that
he
was
on
the
borderline
of
mental
retardation.
mr.
john
czarnecki
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that's
precisely
right.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
state's
representations
before
this
court
that
robert
longberger
had
two
arraignments
are
an
extension
of
his
own
testimony.
robert
longberger
doesn't
know
whether
he
had
two
arraignments.
robert
longberger
recounted
to
the
court
that
he
thought
he
was
in
court
a
couple
times,
and
we
assume,
his
lawyers,
that
he
had
two
arraignments.
robert
longberger
talks
about
a
hearing
at
which
the
victim
testified.
we
assume
that
is
a
preliminary
hearing.
robert
longberger
doesn't
know
if
it
was
a
preliminary
hearing.
we
have
no
idea.
and
all
the
state
need
do,
in
my
view,
to
bear
this
burden
is
to
bring
some
evidence
that
would
substantiate
the
position
that
they
are
now
espousing;
that
this--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--in
our
position,
your
honor,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
burden
is
always
on
the
state
to
show
a
waiver
of
important
constitutional
rights.
and
that
sounds
like
i
am
reading
back
your
language
to
you,
and
i
am
not.
i'm
suggesting
that
our
system
of
jurisprudence
seldom,
if
ever,
casts
upon
a
litigant
the
duty
to
prove
a
negative.
mr.
john
czarnecki
your
honor,
this
court
made
a
decision
in
a
case
precisely
like
that
in
blackledge
versus
allison,
and
it
suggested
that
even
in
a
record
that
is
absolutely
proper
and
regular
on
its
face,
the
defendant,
by
coming
forward
with
some
evidence
to
cast
doubt
upon
the
validity
of
that
conviction
should
be
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
rebut
those
charges.
we
have
a
much
different
situation
here.
mr.
john
czarnecki
i
think
the
court
must
understand
that
this
defendant
started
from
a
different
place.
he
is
not
attacking
a
facially
valid
conviction.
he
is
raising
the
facial
invalidity
of
a
conviction.
he
is
raising
a
conviction
that
is,
on
its
face,
insufficient
to
prove
what
it
is
the
state
wishes
to
prove.
mr.
john
czarnecki
your
honor,
in
the
criminal
practice
in
my
experience,
the
fact
of
a
prior
conviction
is
proved
by
the
state's
introduction
of
a
judgment
entry
or
what
is
often
called,
and
was
called
in
this
case,
a
conviction
statement.
mr.
john
czarnecki
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
that's
the
point
of
my
argument.
the
conviction
statement
simply
said
aggravated
battery,
et
cetera.
it
did
not--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
i
do
not
believe
that
it
did,
your
honor.
the
transcript,
as
the
sixth
circuit
i
think
aptly
pointed
out,
never
contained--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--the
judge
understood
that
he
was
taking
a
plea
for
attempt,
which,
incidentally,
is
something
of
an
unusual
charge
in
that
it
generally
encompasses
some
other
offense.
attempt
could
mean,
without
more,
an
attempted
larceny,
or
an
attempted
murder.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that's
correct,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that's
correct,
your
honor.
which,
by
the
way,
would
form
the
factual
basis
for
an
aggravated
battery.
it's
entirely
consistent
with
this
defendant's
testimony.
mr.
john
czarnecki
no,
an
aggravated
battery,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
your
honor,
if
one,
as
my
client
puts
it,
attempted
on
a
victim,
attempted
to
cut
a
victim
with
a
knife,
under
my
reading...
and
i
think
i
would
be
free
to
suggest
that
the
state
would
agree...
of
illinois
law,
that
act
without
more
would
constitute
an
aggravated
battery;
an
attempt
to
injure
with
a
deadly
weapon.
attempt
with
a
knife
could,
under
anyone's
reading,
reflect
the
factual
basis
for
a
plea
of
aggravated
battery.
that's
all
my
client's
claim
has
been
from
the
outset.
the
sixth
circuit
found
that
the
state
had
failed
to
bear
a
burden
beginning
with
an
insufficient
record.
and
incidentally,
the
circuit
courts
have
been
uniform
in
finding
that
when
the
record
is
silent,
from
boykin,
from
henderson,
the
state
bears
a
heavy
burden;
a
burden
to
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
a
plea,
that
total
relinquishment
of
all
this
defendant,
all
robert
longberger's
constitutional
rights,
casting
them
before
the
court,
must
at
least
be
based
in
the
knowledge
of
the
charge
to
which
he
is
entering
a
plea.
mr.
john
czarnecki
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
i
think
that's
too
much
of
a
legal
conclusion
given
the
fact
that--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
except
in
this
particular
case,
as
i
pointed
out
to
you
before,
the
sixth
circuit
has
found
that
even
if
that
finding
is
to
be
given
deference,
even
if
one
reads
that
phrase
broadly
enough
to
mean
i
find
this
defendant
had
actual
knowledge
of
the
charge,
the
record
is
totally
devoid
of
objective
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
finding
must
be
supported
in
the
record.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
the
court's
question
would
force
me
into
the
defendant's
mind
some
11
years
in
the
past.
all
i
can
represent
to
the
court--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--the
standard
is
not
what
i
would
understand--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--but
i
don't
believe
the
standard,
your
honor,
is
what
an
ordinary
person
would
understand
as
the
state
presents,
or
what
any
other
person
would
understand.
but
rather,
what
this
defendant
understood
or
had
notice
of
in
1972.
mr.
john
czarnecki
the
respondent.
mr.
john
czarnecki
it
was
respondent's
motion.
the
trial
court
gave
it--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--it
was
essentially
a
motion
in
limiting...
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
death
penalty
specification,
but
it
was
essentially
a
collateral
attack
on
that
illinois
guilty
plea.
were
it
no
good,
the
death
penalty
specification
was,
of
course,
inadmissible.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that
is
the
presumption,
but
evidence--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--you
don't
have
to,
but--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--absent
some
evidence,
credible
evidence,
by
the
accused,
yes.
mr.
john
czarnecki
in
this
particular
record,
yes.
there
could
be
guilty
pleas.
but
you
must
remember,
bear
in
mind,
that
this
was
a
plea
bargain.
mr.
john
czarnecki
and,
of
course,
whether
or
not
he
was
arraigned
and
otherwise
notified.
here
there
are
additional
factors
that
are
before
the
court
by
mr.
lonberger's
own
admission,
your
honor.
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
that
is
correct,
it
would
be
our
position
that
he
bore
the
burden
and
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
ohio
trial
court
did
not
credit
his
testimony.
mr.
john
czarnecki
no,
your
honor.
that
was
the--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--that
was
the
very
pivotal
in...
there
were
two
issues.
one
is
that
he
had
never
been
read
the
indictment
or
otherwise
notified
of
the
charge,
because
he
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder
in
new
york
and
pled
guilty
to
second
degree
murder.
mr.
john
czarnecki
therefore,
he
was
never
arraigned
on
it.
and
also,
at
the
hearing,
the
federal
district
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
his
attorney
had
not
told
him,
in
this
particular
case,
that
the
purpose
was
an
element
of
the
crime
of
second
degree
murder.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that
coupled
with
his
intellectual
deficiency
made
it
quasi-credible.
mr.
john
czarnecki
he
said
he
was
arraigned,
despite
mr.
czarnecki's
contrary--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--he
pled
guilty
to
the
original
charge--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--he
pled
guilty
while
represented
by
competent
counsel
to
the
original
charges
on
which
he
said
he
was
indicted...
i'm
sorry...
arraigned
twice.
mr.
john
czarnecki
he
said,
they
took
me
before
a
court
and
arraigned
me.
it's--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--yes,
mr.
lonberger
indicated
that
he
was
present;
that
he
was
arraigned.
he
didn't
go
into
any
specifies
or
didn't
delineate,
did
not
present
any
corroborative
evidence
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
john
czarnecki
he
indicated
he
was
arraigned
twice
and
that
he
had
a
hearing
with
the--
mr.
john
czarnecki
--he
did
not
indicate
that
it
was
ever
read
to
him,
is
the
answer.
mr.
john
czarnecki
the
transcript
you
have
is
only
of
the
guilty
plea,
your
honor.
mr.
john
czarnecki
that's
correct,
your
honor.
