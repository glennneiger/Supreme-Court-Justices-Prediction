justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
drake,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
ohio
nomenclature?
is
a
specification
something
that
just
pertains
if
a
death
penalty
is
being
sought?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
reversed
or
set
aside
the
death
sentence,
did
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
doesn't
the
whole
question
of
specifications
wash
out
at
that
point?
i
couldn't
understand
why
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
focused
on
these
specifications
and
what
it
deemed
a
problem
with
them
when
i
thought
that
had
pretty
well
washed
out
after
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
death
sentence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
it
isn't
entirely
accurate
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
didn't
pay
attention
to
anything
except
the
transcript
of
the
guilty
plea
in
illinois.
it
did
mention
both
the
trial...
ohio
trial
court's
findings
on
that
question
and
the
ohio
court
of
appeals'
findings
on
that
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
that...
if
it
had
any
bearing,
the
status
of
the
illinois
conviction
would
bear
only
on
the
death
penalty
aspect
of
the
case
and
not
on
anything
that
occurred
after
the
death
penalty
was
set
aside.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
really
bear
on
the
case
here?
the
state
didn't
accept
a
stipulation,
and
it's
got
to
bear
the
consequences
of
whatever
resulted
from
introducing
the
evidence;
but
there's
no
federal
rule
that
requires
a
state
to
stipulate
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
counsel,
why
do
you
think
the
sixth
circuit
said
in
its
opinion
that
no
explicit
findings
were
made
concerning
lonberger's
credibility
as
a
witness?
doesn't
that
suggest
that
if
the
ohio
court
had
made
findings,
the
sixth
circuit
would
have
thought
somewhat
differently
of
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
think
they
said
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
doesn't
that
suggest
to
you
that
they
were
giving
some
credibility
to
lonberger's
testimony,
the
sixth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
so,
how
can
you
reconcile
that
with
lavallee
v.
delle
rose
in
410
u.s.?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
think
that
a
federal
habeas
court...
if
an
ohio
court
in
this
case
had
said
we
do
not
believe
lonberger
when
he
testified,
do
you
think
a
federal
habeas
court
would
entitled
to
say
well,
we
think
he
should
have
been
believed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
really
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
our
review
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
the
harmless
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
czarnecki,
do
you
think
that
spencer
and
burgett
are
completely
reconcilable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
were
both...
one
was
six-three
and
the
other
was
five
to
four,
and
they
certainly
point
in
two
completely
opposite
directions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
as
to
the
limiting
instructions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
reconcile
spencer's
treatment
of
limiting
instructions
with
burgett's?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
an
element
of
the
offense,
in
burgett,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
both
cases.
but
not
in
this
case.
not
in
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
specification
washed
out
of
the
case
when
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
death
sentence,
i
would
have
thought.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
be
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
talking
about
this
particular
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
did
it
play...
was
it
one
of
the
elements
upon
which
the
conviction
which
was
actually
sustained
against
him
was
based?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
really,
it's
different
from
burgett
in
that
sense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
that
in
burgett
the
invalid
conviction
was
an
element
of
the
substantive
offense,
and
here
it's
simply...
was
a
question
of
some
evidence
coming
before
the
jury
that
proved
to
be
quite
irrelevant
in
the
light
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
ruling.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
have
to
do
no
more
than
take
some
of
our
later
cases
such
as
parker
against
randolph
which
said
that
juries
are
usually
presumed
to
follow
the
instructions
that
courts
give
them
to
say
that
burgett
may
have
been
too
categorical
on
that
point.
unless
burgett
adopted
a
prophylactic
rule
with
respect
to
the
absence
of
counsel.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what's
the
burden
on
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
an
official
record
of
a
plea
taken
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
that
on
its
face
shows
no
constitutional
defect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
evidence
did
this
defendant
come
forward
with?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
an
attempted
battery.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
other
than
murder
would
you
attempt
with
a
knife?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
first
of
these
is
marshall
against
lonberger
which
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
a
vast
majority
of
the
criminal
trials
in
our
country
occur
in
state
courts
and
some
limited
situations
a
person
convicted
of
a
state
crime
by
a
state
court
may
request
a
federal
court
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
this
writ
which
orders
the
release
of
the
person
from
imprisonment
can
be
obtained
only
when
the
prisoner's
right
under
the
united
states
constitution
had
been
violated.
the
power
of
federal
habeas
courts
to
release
a
prisoner
subject
the
requirement
that
a
federal
habeas
court
give
a
high
measure
of
deference
to
the
factual
conclusions
of
the
state
court.
in
this
case,
an
ohio
jury
convicted
robert
lonberger
of
a
brutal
murder.
many
years
after
his
trial
in
state
court,
lonberger
asked
the
federal
court
to
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ordering
his
release
from
prison.
his
argument
rested
on
the
claim
that
the
prosecution
introduced
evidence
at
his
murder
trial
relating
to
a
plea
of
guilty
in
1972
to
a
charge
of
murder
--
attempted
murder
in
illinois.
lonberger
claimed
that
his
conviction
for
attempted
murder
based
on
his
guilty
plea
was
invalid
because
he
really
intended
to
plead
guilty
to
the
charge
of
attempted
murder.
although
the
ohio
state
courts
have
rejected
lonberger's
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
accepted
it.
in
order
to
do
so,
however,
it
had
to
reject
at
least
one
of
the
implied
factual
findings
of
the
ohio
courts.
the
ohio
trial
court
decided
that
lonberger
was
not
being
completely
truthful
in
claiming
that
he
had
not
meant
to
plead
guilty
to
attempted
murder
in
1972.
the
federal
court
even
though
it
had
never
observed
lonberger
disagreed
with
the
state
court
and
chose
to
believe
his
testimony.
where
a
factual
question
such
as
whether
a
particular
person
is
telling
the
truth
is
involved,
federal
habeas
courts
must
accept
the
findings
of
state
courts
unless
they
are
not
fairly
supportable.
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
observe
this
rule,
we
reverse
its
judgment.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
marshall.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
brennan,
marshall
and
blackmun.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
