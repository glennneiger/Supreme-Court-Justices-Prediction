mr.
richard
david
drake
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
instant
case
presents
two
substantial
questions
concerning
our
nation's
system
of
federalism.
the
initial
inquiry
focuses
upon
the
deference
which
the
federal
judiciary
sitting
in
a
habeas
corpus
action
brought
by
a
state
inmate
must
afford
the
factual
determinations
made
by
the
state
court.
a
resolution
of
this
threshold
issue
centers
upon
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
sumner
v.
mata
and
henderson
v.
morgan.
the
secondary
question
before
this
court
concerns
the
continuing
viability
of
this
court's
decision
in
spencer
v.
texas.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
court
below
erred
with
respect
to
both
issues.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
essentially
uncontroverted.
the
respondent
was
indicted
in
the
ohio
court
of
common
pleas
for
aggravated
murder.
under
then
prevailing
law
aggravated
murder
was
essentially
a
felony
murder.
here,
the
respondent
was
indicted
for
rape
during
commission
of
a
murder.
the
grand
jury
as
a
separate
and
distinct
matter
also
returned
a
death
penalty
specification,
alleging
that
the
respondent
had
previously
been
convicted
of
attempted
murder
in
cook
county,
illinois.
prior
to
trial
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
death
penalty
specification,
alleging
that
his
1972
illinois
guilty
plea
was
not
intelligently
entered.
pursuant
to
this
pretrial
motion
the
ohio
trial
court
conducted
a
full
evidentiary
hearing.
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
several
pertinent
facts
were
developed.
it
was
developed
that
the
respondent
had
been
incarcerated
on
at
least
two
prior
occasions
in
the
illnois
penal
system;
that
he
had
been
charged
with
and
involved
with
the
illinois
courts
unrelated
to
those
prior
incarcerations
with
both
rape
and
murder;
that
in
addition
to
those
crimes
he
had
appeared
before
the
illinois
judiciary
on
several
different
occasions
by
his
own
admission.
it
was
further
developed
that
respondent
was
incarcerated
continuously
in
the
cook
county
jail
for
a
period
of
13
months
prior
to
the
entry
of
this
guilty
plea.
respondent
was
arrested
and
given
an
arraignment.
he
was
thereafter
afforded
a
preliminary
hearing.
by
his
own
testimony
the
victim
in
the...
of
the
illinois
incident
appeared
and
testified,
offered
evidence.
subsequent
to
the
preliminary
hearing
the
illinois
trial
judge
bound
the
case
over
to
the
grand
jury.
they
returned
the
indictment,
charging
the
respondent
with
one
count
of
attempt
under
illinois
law
and
three
counts
of
aggravated
battery.
respondent
was
once
again
arraigned
in
the
illinois...
before
another
illinois
court
on
these
charges.
it
was
further
developed
and
the
ohio
trial
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
respondent
was
both
intelligent
and
literate.
the
respondent
also
conceded
that
he
was
represented
throughout
his
13-month
pretrial
incarceration
by
two
attorneys.
during
the
course
of
the
hearing
the
respondent
contended
that
he
was
never
informed
of
the
attempt
charge,
neither
by
service
of
the
indictment,
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
at
either
of
his
two
arraignments,
by
either
of
his
two
attorneys,
or
in
any
other
manner.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
ohio
evidentiary
hearing
the
ohio
trial
court
expressly
found
that
the
illinois
guilty
plea
had
been
tendered
and
was
tendered
in
an
intelligent
and
voluntary
manner
and
that
the
plea
was
therefore
valid.
it
is
therefore
obvious
that
the
ohio
trial
court
rejected
as
self
serving
testimony
of
the
respondent.
and
might
i
also
add
reference
to
the
record
indicates
that
the
ohio
trial
court
found
his
testimony
wholly
incredible.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no,
your
honor,
there's
never
been
any
allegation
that
the
ohio
trial
court
applied
the
wrong
constitutional
standard
or
review.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
issue
before
the
ohio
court
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
was
in
fact
crystal
clear.
the
respondent's
testimony
was
uniform;
it
never
deviated.
he
said
i
never
knew
i
was
charged
with
attempt...
in
this
particular
instance,
attempted
murder.
no
one
ever
told
me.
it
was
the
sole,
single,
solitary
issue
before
the
court.
he
never
alleged
he
didn't
understand,
for
instance,
the
elements
of
attempt,
but
that
he
never
even
knew
that
he
was
charged
with
it
and
had
no
idea
that
he
had
pled
guilty
to
it.
this
in
the
face
of
a
record
wherein
the
trial
judge
mentions
the
crime
attempt,
indicates
the
separate
penalties
for
attempt,
and
where
his
lawyer
at
the
conclusion
stipulated
that
the
indict...
the
charges,
plural,
in
the
indictment
were
sufficient
both
in
law
and
fact.
i
don't
believe
it's
ever
been
argued
that
the
ohio
trial
court
so
horrendously
misunderstood
the
issue
before
him,
and
it's
never
been
alleged
that
he
applied
the
wrong
standard,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
your
honor,
i
would...
in
response
to
your
question
i
would
refer
the
court
to
this
court's
decision
in
lavallee
v.
delle
rose
wherein
this
court
indicated
that
given
a
straightforward
factual
consideration--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
not
expressly,
your
honor.
that
is
entirely
implicit
by
his
finding.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
believe
it
would
be
logically
inconsistent
not
to
infer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes,
your
honor.
the
indictment
is
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
2.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
illinois
indictment
is
at
page
2,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes.
page
2,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
on
the
charges,
plural,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
he
conceded
that
he
was
at
the
ohio
evidentiary
hearing.
he
never
contended
that
he
wasn't.
his
testimony
again
was
wholly
incredible.
he
indicated
that
mr.
xenos,
the
lawyer
who
represented
him
at
the
illinois
guilty
plea
proceeding,
essentially
told
him
to
go
in
there
and
lie.
that
was
the
crux
of
his
testimony.
he's
never
indicated
he
was
not
in
the
courtroom,
no.
respondent
thereupon
proceeded
to
trial.
in
order
to
prove
the
substantive
charge
of
aggravated
murder
the
prosecutor
presented
in
part,
and
most
important,
the
testimony
of
the
two
sons
of
the
victim.
the
testimony
was
fairly
straightforward.
the
two
young
sons
indicated
that
the
respondent
was
at
their
home
that
evening,
the
only
gentleman
present.
the
one
son
indicated
he
had
heard
his
mother
scream.
the
other
son
thereafter
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
spoke
with
respondent
briefly.
the
lights
were
out,
and
the
respondent
ordered
him
not
to
turn
the
lights
on
and
also
ordered
the
child
back
to
bed.
the
body
of
the
victim
was
subsequently
found
in
a
state
of
undress
in
a
freezer
in
the
kitchen.
also
found
was
a
bent
and
bloodstained
12-inch
knife.
the
cause
of
death
was
the
victim's
throat
was
slashed.
a
pack
of
cigarettes
of
the
respondent's
brand
were
found
in
the
apartment,
and
also
there
was
blood
on
the
respondent's
clothing.
that
was
the
evidence
that
the
state
adduced
in
order
to
substantiate
the
substantive
offense...
here
rape/murder.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes,
your
honor.
under
then...
obviously
because
of
the
bell
and
lockett
decisions
ohio
has...
now
has
a
different
death
penalty.
but
at
the
time
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
prosecutor
to
allege
aggravated
murder,
in
most
instances
felony
murder,
and
then
allege
and
prove
as
an
independent
and
discrete
fact
that
a
specific
aggravating
circumstances,
in
ohio
called
a
death
penalty
specification,
that
had
to
be
alleged
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes,
your
honor,
on
a
ground
wholly
unrelated
to
this
case.
mr.
richard
david
drake
your
honor,
that
was
our
argument.
we
vigorously
argued
that
point.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
this
court's
decision
in
burgett
v.
texas,
extended
not
only
the
rationale
but
the
conclusion
therein
that
the
substantive
offense
had
to
also
be
vacated.
that
was
the
summary
rationale
that
the
court
used.
they
did
not
dwell
on
it
in
any
length
whatsoever
or
give
any
analytical
reasoning
for
the
ultimate
conclusion.
in
order
to
prove
the
separate
and
distinct
factual
question
regarding
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
specification
was
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
ohio
prosecutor
introduced
a
certified
copy
of
the
illinois
judgment
entry
which
was
proper
mode
under
ohio
law
at
that
time.
the
respondent
appealed
his
conviction
to
the
ohio
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
aggravated
murder
conviction
pursuant
to
a
state
law
question.
under
ohio...
the
ohio
law
is
considerably
different
than
the
federal
law.
in
hollin
v.
united
states
this
court
expressly
rejected
a
theory
that
the
prosecution
when
presenting
only
circumstantial
evidence
must
disprove
all
theories
consistent
with
innocence.
ohio
has
the
more
stringent
doctrine
whereby
the
ohio
prosecutor
must
rule
out
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
all
theories
consistent
with
innocence.
here
the
court
of
appeals'
rationale
was
that
since
the
victim
knew
the
respondent,
they
might
have
had
consensual
intercourse
prior
to
the
homicide;
therefore,
it
wouldn't
be
a
forcible
rape.
the
court
of
appeals
reduced
the
aggravated
murder
conviction
to
what
is
called
simple
murder
in
ohio.
respondent
from
that
point
on
and
to
this
day
stands
convicted
of
having
purposely
caused
the
death
of
another.
the
death
penalty
specification
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
incarceration.
he
was
thereafter
resentenced
to
a
term
of
from
15
years
to
life
imprisonment.
he
has
not
faced
the
specter
of
the
death
penalty.
respondent
thereafter
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2254
in
the
united
states
district
court.
the
district
court
reviewed
the
record
and
made
the
following
finding
of
facts
"from
review
of
the
record
this
court
is
satisfied
that
an
ordinary
person
would
have
understood
the
nature
of
the
charges
to
which
petitioner.
"
--respondent...
"was
pleading
guilty".
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court
looked
at
the
illinois
guilty
plea,
the
actual
transcript,
and
found
the
illinois
guilty
plea
facially
invalid.
the
court
did
not
and,
despite
our
urgings,
refused
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
regarding
and
surrounding
the
entry
of
the
illinois
guilty
plea.
this
court
thereafter
summarily
vacated
and
remanded
in
light
of
sumner
v.
mata.
upon
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
sua
sponte
reinstated
its
prior
judgment.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
only
tangential
allusion
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
any
other
facet
of
the
illinois
guilty
plea
is
that
the
ohio
trial
court
did
not
make
an
express
finding
regarding
the
credibility
of
the
respondent.
as
noted
in
the
reply
brief--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--the
three
documents
before
the
court
were
the
illinois
indictment,
the
illinois
judgment
entry,
and
the--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--transcript.
and,
of
course,
the
testimony
and
cross
examination
of
the
respondent
in
the
ohio
trial
court.
mr.
richard
david
drake
your
honor,
it
mentioned
insofar
as
it
stated
them
in
some
manner.
in
sumner
v.
mata
this
court
indicated
that
if
the
federal
judiciary
wishes
to
set
aside
factual
findings
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2254(d)(8),
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
habeas
corpus
applicant
to
allege
and
demonstrate
by
convincing
evidence
that
the
ohio
trial
court
findings
are
not
supported
by
looking
at
the
record
and
the
statute
says
in
its
entirety
here
there
is
absolute...
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
federal
court
is
of
course
free
to
make
a
contrary
determination,
but
it
must
articulate
its
reasons
for
doing
so.
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
articulates
no
reasons
whatsoever.
upon
remand
the
court
sua
sponte
entered
the
same
judgment
it
did.
paramount
in
its
misinterpretation
was
the
misunderstanding
of
this
court's
decision
in
henderson
v.
morgan.
the
court
had
earlier
cited
a
prophylactic
rule
whereby
a
guilty
plea
must
be
more
facially
valid
than
they
found
this
one
in
their
subjective
opinion.
they
did
not
look
to
the
fact
that
he
had
competent
counsel,
the
fact
that
he
was
arraigned
twice,
the
length
of
his
pretrial
incarceration,
the
fact
that
he
was
more
than
conversant
both
with
the
illinois
penal
system
and
most
assuredly
with
the
illinois
judiciary,
beginning
as
a
young...
well,
as
a
juvenile
and
essentially
working
up
from
there
on.
the
illinois
trial
judge
indicated
he'd
been
in
prison
approximately
every
two
years.
these
are
the
factors
which
surrounded
the
entry
of
the
guilty
plea,
that
coupled
with
his
own
personal
characteristics
which
would
be,
of
course,
his
familiarity
with
the
system,
and
his
innate
intelligence,
and
his
literacy
level.
mr.
richard
david
drake
you're
referring
to
the
ohio
trial
judge,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
david
drake
he
did,
in
fact,
listen
to
the
respondent's
testimony.
the
respondent
offered--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--your
honor,
we're
not
complaining.
we
believe
the
ohio
trial
court
did
in
fact
examine
the
totality
of
circumstances
surrounding
the
plea.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no.
we
believe
that
the
ohio
trial
court
finding
is
fully
supported
by
the
record,
and
that
most
assuredly
the
respondent
has
not
indicated
that
it's...
certainly
not
by
convincing
evidence
that
that
factual
finding
is
not
supported
by
the
evidence
before
the
ohio
trial
judge.
mr.
richard
david
drake
the
reason
i
mention
it,
your
honor,
is
because
the
court
below
refused
to
consider
the
very
factors
upon
which
the
ohio
trial
court
predicated
its
determination
that
that
illinois
guilty
plea
was
intelligently
entered.
the
only
reference
is
to
the
transcript
of
the
illinois
proceeding
itself.
the
court
points
out...
and
again,
it's,
i
believe,
only
a
one-line
statement...
that
the
ohio
trial
court
failed
to
make
express
factual
findings
regarding
the
credibility
of
the
respondent.
that,
of
course,
has
already
been
considered
by
this
court
in
a
different
case,
lavallee
v.
delle
rose.
the
ohio
trial
court,
had
he
credited
respondent's
testimony,
he
would
have
had
no
choice
but
to
dismiss
the
death
penalty
specification;
that's
apparent
from
the
record.
and
the
disagreement
or
the
statement
by
the
court
below
that
the
ohio
trial
court
did
not
make
credibility
findings
is
beyond
me
in
light
of
what
the
record
was.
mr.
richard
david
drake
well,
your
honor,
i,
as
an
attorney,
would
have
liked
to
briefed
and
argued
the
case
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
sumner
v.
mata.
it
was
perhaps
the
bellweather
decision
interpreting
the
28
u.s.c.
2254(d).
i
believe
that
with
further
briefing
and
argument
that
perhaps
the
court
would
not
have
erred
to
the
degree
i
believe
it
did.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
did
not
mean
to
be
overly
critical
of
the
court
below,
your
honor.
in
henderson
v.
morgan
this
court
set
forth
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
wherein
one
judges
whether
the
accused
was
given
adequate
notice
of
the
true
nature
of
the
charges
against
them
so
as
to
comply
with
due
process.
i
have
elaborated
upon
what
i
believe
are
the
circumstances
which
fully
substantiate
the
findings
of
the
ohio
trial
court.
i
would
only
reiterate
in
sumner
v.
mata
there
is
a
requirement
that
the
federal
judiciary...
that
first
of
all
the
habeas
corpus
applicant
demonstrate
by
convincing
evidence
that
state
court
findings
are
not
fully
substantiated
by
reference
to
the
record.
here
i
believe
there
has
not
only
been
a
showing
of
convincing
evidence,
but
that
would
be
impossible.
the
court
below
essentially
allowed
the
respondent
a
presumption
by
looking
only
at
the
record,
finding
it
in
their
opinion
facially
defective,
and
refusing
to
examine
those
other
factors
which
surrounded
the
entry
of
this
plea.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no,
your
honor.
i
did
not
try
the
case.
there
is
no--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--no,
your
honor.
any
constitutional
ramifications
would
have
been
dissipated
by
this
court's
decision
in
spencer
v.
texas.
as
set
forth
in
the
brief,
what
i
believe
to
be
a
very,
very
fine
limiting
instruction
was
given
to
the
jury.
not
only
that,
but
in
the
voir
dire
of
this
case
the
jury
assured
both
the
ohio
trial
judge
and
counsel
that
they
would
abide
by
any
limiting
instruction.
they
would
resolve
the
guilt
or
innocence
as
to
the
substantive
offense
independent
of
any
evidence
presented
regarding
mr.
lonberger's
prior
escapades
with
law
enforcement
agencies
or
officials
in
illinois.
the
second
question
presented
by
this
case
presents
an
equally
compelling
issue
of
federal-state
comity
insofar
as
the
decision
of
the
court
below
wholly
disrupts
state
evidentiary
proceedings
maintained
pursuant
to
this
court's
decision
in
spencer
v.
texas.
even
assuming
the
correctness...
and
petitioner
in
no
manner
does...
of
the
circuit
court
finding
with
respect
to
the
facial
validity
of
respondent's
previously
entered
guilty
plea,
and
again,
even
the
court
below
indicates
they're
dealing
only
with
the
facial
validity
and
fully
acknowledge
that
this
plea
may
well
be
very
validly
a
constitutionally
entered
plea,
in
their
opinion.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
in--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
of
a
very
specific
nature,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
it
is
my
opinion
in
my
reading
of--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--no.
mr.
richard
david
drake
i
believe
there's
clearly
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
that
in
burgett.
for
instance...
assuming,
for
instance,
that
this
guilty
plea
was
invalid,
most
assuredly
mr.
lonberger
could
not
be
sentenced
to
death,
but
it
should
not
affect
the
validity
of
a
murder
conviction
wherein
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
he
did
in
fact
murder
the
victim
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes.
the
remedial
action
by
the
court
should
be
limited
or
commensurate
with
the
violation
perceived.
burgett
was
a
different
case
insofar...
this
court
had
recently
decided
at
that
time
gideon
v.
wainwright.
the
court
considered
that
states
were
using
uncounseled
guilty
pleas
in
express
violation
of
gideon
and
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
burgett
was
necessary
to
ensure
the
continuing
viability
of
gideon.
states
were
not
going
to
be
allowed
to
use
uncounseled
guilty
pleas,
which
this
court
deemed
to
be
inherently
unreliable
and
presumptively
prejudicial.
the
uncounseled
guilty
pleas
considered
in
burgett
this
court
found
to
be
presumptively
invalid,
i.e.,
facially
invalid.
the
prosecutor
either
knew
or
should
have
known
that
he
was
not
to
be
using
these.
the
burgett
decision
can
only
be
reconciled
with
spencer...
the
underpinning
of
spencer
is
that
juries
both
in
civil
and
here
in
the
criminal
context
can
and
will
follow
limiting
instructions.
juries
are
called
on
to
do
this
all
the
time,
either
in
multiple
co-defendants--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--but
burgett,
loper
v.
betto,
all
the
decisions
stemming
from
burgett
have
been
limited
to
gideon
v.
wainwright
type
contexts.
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
mere
fact--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--this
court
apparently
found
that
the
use
of
uncounseled
convictions
was
so
inherently
prejudicial
that
the
actual...
in
point
of
fact
in
burgett
the
uncounseled
convictions
were
never
even
presented
to
the
jury.
the
judge
withdrew
that
from
the
jury's
consideration
at
the
last
moment.
but
only
in
the
gideon
v.
wainwright
context
to
ensure
the
continuing
validity
in
the
face
of
apparently
animosity
by
various
states
to
that
decision
was
such
a
draconian
measure
deemed
necessary.
the
court
has
never
used
that
remedy,
i.e.,
the
vacation
of
the
substantive
offense
despite
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt
on
that
offense
when
limiting
instructions
have
been
given
outside
the
gideon
v.
wainwright
context,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
david
drake
your
honor,
i'm
reading
burgett
narrowly,
yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes.
mr.
richard
david
drake
this
court
has
never
so
held,
your
honor.
if
the
court
were
to
so
hold,
the
states
would
most
assuredly
have
to
change
their
procedures.
the
states
would
almost
have
to
go
to
bifurcated
or
even
trifurcated
trials
in
any
enhanced
penalty
setting.
mr.
richard
david
drake
no,
your
honor.
i
can
only
inferentially
because
the
court
has
ever
extended
burgett
outside
that
context.
mr.
richard
david
drake
in
this
particular
context...
and
i'm
dealing
with
ohio
laws
that
existed...
there's
the
unfortunate
specter
that
jeopardy
might
have
attached
when
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
into
aggravated
murder,
because
the
death
penalty
specification,
we're
talking
about
a
unitary
proceeding.
to
have
bifurcated
it
would
have
opened
the
door
to
mr.
lonberger
arguing
the
jeopardy
attachment,
and
you
could
not
then
present
that
to
the
jury.
that
relates
to
this
case--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--that
is
a
very
limited
answer
to
your
question
as
far
as
the
entire
ramifications
across
the
nation.
the
court
in
spencer
indicated
the
state
has
a
viable
and
substantial
interest
in
trying
all
charges
together.
spencer
stands
for
the
proposition
that
juries
can
and
will
follow
limiting
instructions
to--
mr.
richard
david
drake
--you're
talking
about
this
particular
case?
mr.
richard
david
drake
again,
i
did
not
try
the
case.
i
don't
know
the
nature
of
the
offer
of
the
stipulation.
it's
very
briefly
related
in
the...
i
believe
counsel
relates
it
to
the
judge
in
a
midtrial
or
pretrial
context,
and
it's
not
really
set
forth
whether
it's
a
stipulation
subject
to
subsequent
objection
or
what
the
nature
of
the
stipulation
was,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
richard
david
drake
as
burgett
is
being
read
by
the
court
below,
it
wouldn't
alter
our
presence
before
this
court.
i
assume
they
were
going
to
reserve
their
right
to
appeal
the
pretrial
ruling
regarding
the
validity
of
the
illinois
guilty
plea.
mr.
richard
david
drake
your
honor,
i
honestly
fail
to
see
the
difference.
the
jury
would
have
known
that
he
was
convicted
previously
of
attempted
murder.
that
apparently
is
the
prejudice
that
the
court
below
looked
to.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
david
drake
yes,
your
honor.
two
points.
the
difficulty
here
is
that
the
respondent
endeavors
to
assume
that
no
evidence
had
been
presented
whatsoever,
which
i
believe
is
justice
stevens'
question...
on
other
words,
had
not
mr.
lonberger
testified
at
the
ohio
hearing...
that
some
burden
would
have
been
foisted
upon
the
state
of
ohio
to
validate
this
plea.
i
would
note
that
in
henderson
versus
morgan,
it
was
precisely
this
contention
by
the
state
that
you're
inviting
countless
collateral
attacks
to
guilty
pleas
than
the
court
indicated.
moreover,
even
without
an
express
representation,
it
may
be
appropriate
to
presume
that
in
most
cases,
defense
counsel
routinely
explain
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
sufficient
detail
to
give
the
accused
notice
of
what
he
is
being
asked
to
admit.
the
burden
here
was
by
convincing
evidence--
