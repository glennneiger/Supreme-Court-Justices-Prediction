justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
another
point.
what
did
you
say
earlier
about
what
the...
how
free
was
the
federal
habeas
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
to
disagree
with
the
ohio
court's
finding
with
respect
to
intelligent
and
voluntary?
did
it
need
to
give
any
deference
at
all
to
the
ohio
court's
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
that?
you
say
it
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
it
was?
so
what
if
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
what
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
is
free
to
independently
look
at
the
same
record
and
come
out
with
a
different
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
your
position
is
that
the
federal
court
need
give
no
deference
to
the
state
court's
conclusion
about
an
intelligent
and
voluntary
plea?
that
it
can
look
at
the
same
record
that
the
state
court
did
and
come
up
with
a
different
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
ohio
court
really
didn't
do
its
job
in
making
the
kind
of
findings
that
it
should
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
only
on
the
basis
of
the...
why
do
you
say
you
can't
tell
that
the
ohio
court
made
the
necessary
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
attempt
with
a
knife.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
suppose
two
or
three
situations.
suppose
that
in
the
ohio
proceeding,
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
the
ohio
court
found
that
this
guilty
plea
was
intelligent
and
voluntary
and
that
he
had
had
notice
and
knew
of
the
plea.
you
would
think
there
would
have
to
be
some
deference
to
that
in
the
habeas
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
suppose
the
judge
says
i
find
it
to
be
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
plea
and
valid.
would
there
have
to
be
any
deference
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
cases
and
plenty
of
them
that
would
say
that
even
if
all
the
judge
said
was
i
find
the
plea
to
be
valid.
we
have
cases
that
say
unless
there's
some
indication
to
the
contrary,
that
you
assume
that
a
knowledgeable
judge
or
a
state
judge
has
applied
the
right
legal
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
record
maybe,
but
that
was
the
finding
of
the
state
court.
