justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
true
that
the
ohio
court
did
not
say
in
so
many
words
that
the
defendant
knew
he
was
charged
with
attempt,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
can
answer
my
question
without
referring
to
another
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
trial
court
did
not
in
so
many
words
find
that
he
had
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
charged
with
attempt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
infer
that
from
the
finding
that
he
intelligently
and
voluntarily
entered
his
plea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
drake,
wouldn't
that
have
required
burdette,
or
burgett,
rather,
to
be
decided
the
other
way,
because
wasn't
there
a
limiting
instruction
there
and
wasn't
it
offered
just
for
enhancement
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
it's
a
different
constitutional
thing,
but
if
you...
insofar
as
your
harmless
error
argument
is
made,
wouldn't
that
also
have
been
valid
in
the
burgett
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
is
it
not
clear...
i
mean
i
know
you
didn't
try
the
case...
but
is
it
not
clear
that
had
the
stipulation
been
accepted,
the
argument
of
prejudice
would
have
been
totally
put
to
one
side,
would
have
been
avoided.
because
they
claim
prejudice
by
getting
this
prior
conviction
before
the
jury
during
the
guilt
and
innocence
phase,
and
had
you
accepted...
had
your
trial
lawyer,
rather,
accepted
the
stipulation,
that
prejudice
at
least
would
not
have
been
in
this
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
that
it
wouldn't
have
affected
any
of
the...
it
only
could
have
affected
the
death
penalty
then.
but
the
problem
is
now
it
may
taint
the
verdict
on
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
about
his
testimony?
who
called
him
as
a
witness?
i
can't
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
position
is
that
if
you
just
disregard
his
testimony,
your
opponent
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
still
hadn't
met
it,
because
the
record
of
the
illinois
trial
shows
a
facially
defective...
does
not
show
a
plea
of
guilty
to
attempted
murder.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
had
the
burden
of
going
outside
the
record
and
proving
attempted
murder,
and
they
didn't...
you
could
take
his
testimony
outside
the
record,
and
you
would
still
argue
that
they
didn't
sustain
their
burden.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
really
have
to
care
much
about
credibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
the
transcript
doesn't
ever
include
the
words
"attempted
murder"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
about
that.
we're
talking
now
about
the
hearing
in
advance
of
trial
in
the
ohio
court
in
support
of
the
state's
motion
to
use
the
prior
plea
to
aggravate
the
sentence.
who
went
forward
with
evidence
at
that
hearing?
who
put
on
the
first
witness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
respondent,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--was
it
a
motion
to
prevent
the
state
from
using
it,
rather
than
a
motion
for
permission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
be
content
to
take
the
position
that
we
can
simply
look
at
the
illinois
guilty
plea
proceeding,
and
that's
all
the
evidence
you
need?
on
the
basis
of
the
presumption
that
you
read
from
the
henderson
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
have
to
get
involved
in
credibility
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
an
indictment
that
charged
attempted
murder,
and
even
though
the
judge
was
a
little
imprecise
in
saying...
just
mentioning
the
aggravated
battery
and
the
word
"attempt"
without
ever
using
the
word
"murder",
the
fact
that
the
indictment
mentioned
attempted
murder
and
the
fact
that
we
can
presume
counsel
normally
tell
their
clients
what
the
charge
is,
that's
enough
for
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
say
there
was
no
evidence
except
what
i
described.
would
you
be
willing
to
rest
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
our
task
is
limited
to
two
questions,
as
i
see
it.
just
look
at
the
indictment
and
find
out
if
the
man
was
represented
by
counsel.
maybe
that
should
be
the
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
isn't
it
a
little
stronger
than
that?
we
do
have
a
transcript
with
at
least
some
of
the
illinois
proceedings,
and
that
transcript
does
not
include
a
reading
of
the
indictment
to
the
defendant.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
whatever
we
have
from
illinois;
we
do
have
some
transcript
from
illinois.
that
transcript
does
not
include
a
reading
of
the
indictment
to
the
defendant.
