and
mr.

you

mr.

chief

how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
statement
on
page
5,
after
they've
gone
through...
page
5,
the
appendix
to
your
cert
petition.
after
they'd
gone
through
the
usual
inquiry
by
the
court
to
him
about
what
he
had
done,
in
fact,
then
the
court
summarized
at
the
end,
"understand
that
by
pleading
guilty,
i
could
sentence
you
from
one
to
ten.
"
--and
i
assume
he
means
years,
one
to
ten
years...
"on
the
aggravated
battery,
and
attempt
one
to
20.
"
"so
i
could
sentence
you
to
the
penintentiary
for
a
maximum
of
one
to
40
years.
"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
he
answered...
the
judge
then
repeated,
"do
you
understand
that"?
and
he
answered,
"yes,
sir".
so
would
you
ignore
that
exchange,
even
after
it
followed
the
more
detailed
inquiries
about
what
he
had,
in
fact,
done,
what
the
criminal
acts
were?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
make
these
observations
concerning
the
sixth
circuit's
view
of
the
credibility
aspect
of
longberger's
credibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
would
a
factfinder
sitting
as
a
juror
believe
about
the
credibility
of
longberger
against
the
background
that's
in
the
record
here
of
his
criminal
activities
all
his
life?
wouldn't
they
discredit
his
credibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
think
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
going
back
to
your
statement
just
before
justice
white's
question
to
you.
you
said
he
couldn't
have
thought
there
were
two
crimes
involved
here.
let
me
repeat
to
you
again
the
question:
after
the
judge
had
gone
through
all
these
specific
questions,
in
which
admittedly,
the
word
"murder"
was
left
out,
but
"attempt
with
a
knife",
then
he
said,
"do
you
understand
by
pleading
guilty
i
could
sentence
you
from
one
to
ten
on
aggravated
battery.
"
clearly,
nothing
ambiguous
about
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
attempt,
one
to
20.
now,
didn't
that
convey
a
message
that
the
second
crime
that
the
judge
was
talking
about
was
the
much
more
severe
crime
of
the
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
understand
about
it?
let's
put
it
that
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
there
were
two
crimes,
and
one
was
much
more
serious
than
the
other.
is
that
not
what
almost
anyone
would
understand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
drake?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinions
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
