mr.
drake,
one
thing
worries
me.
what
do
you
want
more
than
the
record
of
the
illinois
case?
what
do
you
want
more
than
the
record?
you
said
he
saw
the
whole
record,
right,
of
the
illinois
conviction,
the
illinois
plea
guilty.
he
saw
the
whole
record.
what
else
should
he
have
listened
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
you
complaining
about
on
that
point
about
him
relying
on
the
illinois
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
make
no
complaint
about
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
at
a
loss
as
to
why
you
keep
mentioning
it.
i
guess
i
just
missed
something,
that's
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
henderson,
didn't
they
read
the
indictment
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
didn't
appear
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
in
henderson.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
he
said
he
went
three
or
four
times.
he
wasn't
clear
about
any
of
them,
was
he?
did
he
say
he
want
to
court
three
or
more
times?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
my
answer
is
which
one
of
these
was
the
indictment
read
to
him?
you
don't
know.
