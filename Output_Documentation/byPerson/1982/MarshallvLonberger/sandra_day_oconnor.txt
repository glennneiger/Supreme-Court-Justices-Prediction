justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
is
it
possible
that
the
ohio
court
believed
that
the
respondent
didn't
receive
an
explanation
of
the
charges
but
that
his
lawyer
understood
them
and
simply
enforced
the
lawyer's
understanding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
not
crystal
clear,
is
it,
what
the
ohio
court
was
deciding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
drake,
did
the
court
look
at
anything
other
than
the
bare
transcript
from
illinois
that
we
have
in
the
record?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
a
record
from
illinois
before
the
court
with
all
of
the
documents
in
it
and
any
written
plea
agreement
or
anything
of
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
transcript?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
what
difficulties
would
the
state
face
in
bifurcating
the
evidence
for
purposes
of
sentencing
as
opposed
to
putting
it
on
initially
at
the
guilt
or
innocence
phase?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
the
charges
were
filed
initially
in
a
way
to
indicate
that
that
would
be
the
procedure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
the
face
of
the
stipulation
that
was
offered,
i
still...
it's
still
unclear
to
me
what
interest
the
state
would
have
in
introducing
the
evidence
of
prior
convictions
in
the
guilt/innocent
phase.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
do
you
allege,
then...
why
do
you
say
it
was
insufficient
on
its
face?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
a
conviction
statement
reflected
the
aggravated
battery
and
the
attempted
murder,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state
then
introduced
the
transcript
to
supplement
what
the
"et
cetera"
was.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
transcript
reflected
the
attempted
murder
as
well
as
the
aggravated
battery.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
whether
the
defendant
understood
it
is
another
question,
but
the
transcript
reflected
that
the
judge
understood
it,
anyway,
right?
