justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
in
spencer
the
prior
convictions
were
concededly
all
valid,
weren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
here
at
least
we
have
a
holding
that
the
guilty
plea
in
illinois
was
invalid.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
burgett,
i
gather,
we
had
all
invalid
prior
convictions,
didn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
think
there's
a
distinction
between--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--valid
and
invalid
prior
convictions
for
the
purposes
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
burgett
opinion
said
anything
to
the
effect
that
only
uncounseled
convictions
were
invalid
for
the
purposes
of
the
burgett
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
certainly
are.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
other
invalid
convictions
would
have
the
benefit
of
the
burgett
rule,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
can
you
show
me
anything
in
the
burgett
opinion
which
suggests
what
you're
arguing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
do
you
say
it
was
constitutionally
invalid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
procedural
invalidity?
what
kind
of
invalidity
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
still
asking
is
this
a
constitutional
invalidity
to
admit
it
then?
it
was
admitted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
that
sense
it's
not
like
the
prior
convictions
in
burgett,
is
it?
