may
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
is
it
not
true
that
in
a
withholding
case,
as
phelps
was,
you've
got
cash
involved
that
should
have
been
paid
out,
you
know,
the
withholding
money,
that
that
would
not
be
property
that
the
trustee
could
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
in
this
case,
the
physical
assets
would
be
property
that
could
be
used?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
true?
i
understood--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
before
you
get
into
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
assets
in
dispute,
as
i
understand
it,
are
primarily
physical
assets.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
have
a
statement
in
your
brief
they
had
a
going
concern
value
of
$162,000
or
something
of
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
is
what
i
wanted
to
know.
there
was
a
finding
to
that
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is,
of
course,
in
excess
of
the
government's
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
