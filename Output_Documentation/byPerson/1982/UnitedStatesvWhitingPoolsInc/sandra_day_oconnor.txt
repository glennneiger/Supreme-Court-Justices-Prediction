mr.
smith,
in
all
these
bankruptcy
situations,
there
obviously
isn't
enough
money
to
go
around
or
we
wouldn't
be
having
bankruptcy
proceedings
filed,
and
isn't...
if
the
government
were
able
to
sell
the
property,
it
would
only
recover
part
of
the
taxes.
the
theory
of
these
reorganizations,
of
course,
is
to
get
the
bankrupt
back
on
its
or
his
feet
to
be
able
to
pay
the
creditors
perhaps
in
full.
is
the
government
not
better
off
if
your
security
is
adequate
waiting
it
out
with
the
rest
of
the
creditors
and
getting
more
of
the
tax
money?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
concern
i
have...
the
concern
i
have
is
that
probably
in
almost
every
case
of
a
bankruptcy
reorganization
there
are
taxes
owed
the
government,
and
if
the
government
is
going
to
take
the
position
on
all
these
cases
that
it
wants
its
levy
and
its
money
out,
then
probably
the
reorganization
aspects
will
not
be
able
to
proceed
in
many
cases,
and
so
i
was
curious
why--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you
are--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
what
you
are
saying,
mr.
smith,
is
that
property
of
the
estate
refers
to
the
debtor's
interest
in
property
and
not
to
property
in
which
the
debtor
has
an
interest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
that
is
your
theory,
it
makes
reorganization
impossible
in
any
case,
because
every
creditor
would
be
the
same.
it
is
impossible.
