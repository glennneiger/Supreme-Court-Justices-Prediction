chief

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
whiting
pools.
mr.
smith,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
value
of
the
property
seized
when
the
adjustment,
$20,000
adjustment
was
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
amount
of
the
government's
claim?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--let
me
back
you
up
a
little
bit,
mr.
smith.
if
this
party
had
done
what
they
should
have
done,
this
$92,000
would
have
been
in
a
separate
account,
an
agency
or
a
trust
account
separate
and
apart
from
all
the
other
assets
of
the
employer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
least
it
would
have
been
set
aside
if
it
hadn't
been
paid
over.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
in
this
rehabilitation
concept
of
chapter
11,
could
that
$92,000
have
been
used
for
any
of
the
purposes
of
restoring
this
business?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
it
is
in
a
separate
category--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--and
are
you
asserting
that
what
was
left
of
the...
what
was
available
is
subject
to
a
constructive
trust?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
corporation
here
ever
acquire
any
title
to
these
tax
moneys?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
the
money
that
was
put
into
these
accounts,
that
he
did
not
put
into
the
accounts
but
should
have
put
into
the
accounts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
go
back
to
my
other
question.
if
it
had
done
what
it
should
have
done
with
its
trust
money,
it
would
have
had
a
separate
account,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
$92,000
would
be
there.
would
the
creditors
be
entitled
to
one
penny
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
relin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
put
to
you
the
question
i
put
to
your
friend,
mr.
relin.
if
this
corporation
had
done
what
it
should
have
done,
put
this
money
in
a
separate
account,
there
would
have
been
$92,000
in
that
account
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
could
it
use
any
part
of
that
money
for
its
corporate
affairs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
would
be
an
embezzlement
if
they
did
so,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
sometimes
called
embezzlement--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--when
trustees
take
the
money
and
use
it
for
their
own
affairs
and
then
lose
it,
especially
if
they
lose
it.
now,
when
did
the
right
of
the
creditors,
the
general
creditors
or
the
secured
creditors,
ever
attach
to
any
part
of
that,
as
we
find
it,
a
mythical
fund,
a
fund
that
by
his
own
default
was
not
created?
when
did
they
ever
acquire
any
rights
to
share
in
that
$92,000?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
the
law,
especially
on
the
equity
side,
assumes
what
that
was
done
what
should
have
been
done.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that
would
be
true
if
the
$92,000
were
there,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
should
the
general
creditors
profit
by
the
embezzlement
or
at
least
the
default,
to
use
a
kinder
word,
of
the
debtor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
predicate
for
that
statutory
provision
is
that
the
money
belonged
to
the
debtor,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me.
before
you
go
on--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--542(a)
after
the...
other
than
custodian
in
possession
language,
is
followed
by
what
appears
to
be
limitation
of
property
that
the
trustee
may
use.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if,
as
i
had
suggested
in
my
earlier
question,
this
company
had
done
what
they
should
have
done
legally,
put
it
in
a
separate
account
identified
as
withholding
tax,
then
would
that
have
been
property
that
the
trustee
may
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
bank
accounts?
what
about
taxing--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--is
impressed
with
a
constructive
trust.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
trustee...
if
the
government
could
show
that
some
of
this
$92,000
was
used
to
purchase
the
physical,
tangible
assets
that
were
seized,
would
the
constructive
or
resulting
trust
follow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
hasn't
been
undertaken.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
