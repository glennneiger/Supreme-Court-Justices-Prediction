mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
bankruptcy
tax
collection
case
comes
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
it
presents
an
important
question
under
the
new
bankruptcy
code,
whether
a
bankruptcy
court
in
a
reorganization
proceeding
under
chapter
11
may
compel
the
government
under
section
542(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
to
turn
over
to
the
debtor
in
possession
property
which
the
government
had
seized
by
levy
to
satisfy
the
debtor's
delinquent
federal
tax
liabilities
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple,
and
can
be
summarized
as
follows.
respondent
is
a
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
servicing
swimming
pools.
in
1979
and
1980,
it
had
unpaid
assessments
for
withholding,
employee
withholding
and
social
security
taxes
amounting
to
some
$92,000.
these
liabilities
had
gone
unpaid
for
almost
as
much
as
two
years,
and
on
january
14th,
1981,
the
internal
revenue
service
exercised
its
statutory
rights
to
levy
on
respondent's
inventory
equipment
and
other
tangible
property.
this
was
done
by
placing
a
padlock
on
the
premises,
and
the
property
therefore
was
seized
pursuant
to
section
6331(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
very
next
day,
january
15th,
1981,
respondent
filed
a
petition
for
reorganization
under
chapter
11
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
value
of
the
property
was
found
by
the
bankruptcy
court
to
have
a
liquidating
value
of
$35,000.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
amount
of
the
government's
claim
is
$92,000.
the
$20,000
adjustment,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
somewhat
of
a...
well,
it
is
really
not
before
the
court,
because
it
involves
the
adequate
protection
question,
but
let
me
simply
say
in
passing
that
the
government
took
the
position,
correctly,
we
think,
below,
that
that
$20,000
did
not
constitute
adequate
protection
because
that
was
$20,000
in
the
bank
account
that
the
government
had
exercised
its
seizure
rights.
so
what
was
being
done
essentially
was
saying...
was
the
bankruptcy
court
saying,
well,
you
have
adequate
protection
here
because
i
am
going
to
take
this
$20,000.
you
have
got
$20,000
already.
that
was
with
respect
to
another
seizure.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
not
before
the
court.
by
doing
this,
by
filing
this
petition,
the
respondent
became
a
debtor
in
possession,
and
one
month
later,
in
february,
the
internal
revenue
service
sought
to
exercise
its
statutory
rights
under
section
6335
of
the
code
to
sell
the
seized
property
and
to
reduce
it
to
cash
and
to
apply
it
against
the
tax
liability.
it
then,
because
of
that,
because
it
wished
to
do
that,
it
went
into
bankruptcy...
it
went
into
the
bankruptcy
court
on
february
18th
and
sought
an
order
from
the
bankruptcy
judge
that
the
automatic
stay
provisions
of
section
362
did
not
bar
its
sale
of
the
property,
principally
because
the
property
was
seized.
it
was
not
part
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
respondent
counterclaimed
and
sought
an
order
which
is
at
issue
here,
the
propriety
of
which
is
at
issue
here,
requiring
the
government
to
turn
over
the
seized
property
under
section
542(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
bankruptcy
court
upheld
the
government
on
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court.
it
held
that
respondent
was
not
entitled
to
compel
a
turnover
order...
to
a
turnover
order
under
542(a),
and
the
district
court
on
review
likewise
upheld
the
government.
it
basically
held,
in
accordance
with
our
submission
here,
that
the
seized
property
was
not
property
of
the
estate
within
the
meaning
of
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
was
hence
not
subject
to
turnover.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
on
the
basis
of
peculiar
to
the
government's
position,
that
the
government
is
not
simply
seizing
secured
credit,
but
operates,
as
the
court...
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
and
the
court
recognized
in
phelps,
the
government...
the
government's
position
as
tax
collector
is
really
quite
different
and
distinct,
and
congress
has
so
made
it
different
and
distinct
because
of
the
involuntary
nature
of
the
government's
creditor
relationship.
in
other
words,
we
did
not...
unlike
a
bank,
we
did
not
enter
into
a
voluntary
relationship
with
respondent
to
lend
it
money,
and
hope,
you
know,
and
take
collateral.
we
basically...
here
we
are
in
the
position
where,
as
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized,
the
respondent
helped
itself
to
the
government's
money.
this
was...
these
were
with
principally
employee
withholding
taxes.
so
the
respondent
paid
net
payrolls,
never
paid
over
the
money
that
the...
you
know,
in
a
timely
way
that
you
are
supposed
to.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
the
aspect
of
employee
withholding
taxes
gives
this
case
peculiar
force.
i
mean,
i
think
what
it
does
is
show
that,
you
know,
essentially
this
was
an
involuntary...
essentially
respondent
was
borrowing
money
from
the
government
in
an
involuntary
way.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
that
was
something
of
somewhat
peculiar
force
because
of
that
fact.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
again,
i
think
it
would
be
the
same
with
respect
to
income
taxes,
and
the
code
suggests
that,
you
know,
once
taxes
are
delinquent
and
owing,
the
full
panoply
of
statutory
authority
rests
in
the
commission
to
take
these
steps.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
justice
o'connor,
that
may
well
be
the
case
in
a
particular
case.
i
don't
think
that
in
hindsight
any
of
us
can
sit
back
and
say
what
the
government
ought
to
have
done
here.
this
was
a
situation
in
which
these
taxes
went
unpaid
for
almost
two
years.
i
can
assure
you
and
the
court
on
the
basis
of
how
the
internal
revenue
service
behaves
that
levies
do
not
occur
gladly
or
with
alacrity.
they
are
done
really
as
a
last
resort,
and
i
would...
and
the
instruction--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--yes.
well,
i
would
simply...
i
would
simply
suggest...
suggest
that
the
government
exercises
its
levy
rights
only,
i
am
sure,
when
it
is
satisfied
that
the
debtor
in
possession
or
the
bankrupt
corporation
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
survive.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
exercise
of
these
statutory
rights
of
levy
are
rights
which
congress
has
vested
in
the
commissioner
to
take,
notwithstanding--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
would
not
say
only
got
phelps.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
is
no...
there
are
no
chapter
10
cases.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
um-hm.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
let
me...
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
justice
white,
there
have
been...
there
are
no
decided
cases--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--the
practice--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--the
practice,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
government
exercised
its
rights
of
levy
when
it
felt
that
they
were
necessary
and
appropriate.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i'm
aware...
i'm
aware
of
no
decisions
forbidding
the
government
from
doing
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
or
approving
it.
and
the
point
we
are
simply
making
is
that
here--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--indeed.
indeed.
but
i
think
the
government
is--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--indeed
it
is,
although
i
think
that,
you
know,
our
primary
and
principal
argument
is
that
the
government
stands
in
a
very
distinct
position.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it
is
the
argument
that
we
make,
you
know,
and
basically
it
is
an
argument
based
on
this
court's
recognition
in
phelps,
a
unanimous
recognition--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no.
no,
but
the
point--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--but
we
think
that
phelps
is
persuasive
on
this,
and
let
me
explain
why.
phelps
dealt
with
the
situation
that
the
court
had
to
decide
who
had
possession
of
this
fund
that
was
in
the
hands
of
an
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors.
the
government
had
served
notice
of
seizure
which
the
court
recognized
was
tantamount
to
a
levy
in
that
situation.
now,
once
the
government...
once
the
government
did
that,
then
after
that
the
debtor
filed
a
petition
for
reorganization,
and
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--under
chapter
11.
the
government...
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
this
was
subject
to
the
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
or
whether
it
was
subject
to
plenary
jurisdiction,
but
in
deciding
whether
it
was
subject
to
summary
or
plenary
jurisdiction,
the
court
necessarily
had
to
determine
who
had
possession
of
this
property--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--and
the
court
held
that
the
assignee
was
holding
the
property
in
constructive
possession
for
the
government.
it's
as
if,
really,
what
the
court
said,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
it,
the
court
said--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--that
may
well
be,
but
i
think
the
important--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
beg
to
differ
with
the
court,
only
because
the
middle
part
of
the
opinion
discusses
at
great
length
the
effect
of
a
levy.
it
says,
"here
we
are
concerned
not
with
the
priority
of
tax
liens,
but
with
the
effect
of
a
tax
levy.
"
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
"historically,
service
of
notice
has
been
sufficient
to
seize
a
debt,
and
notice
of
levy
and
demand
are
equivalent
to
seizure.
"
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--there
is
authority
that
is
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
that
suggests
that
that
would
have
been
subject
to
a
turnover.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
under
a
chapter
10.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
point...
i
think
the
essential
point
of
phelps
is,
no
matter
what
kind
of
proceeding
existed
under
the
old
bankruptcy
law,
phelps
turns
on
the
recognition
as
to
what
the
effect
of
a
levy
is,
and
i
think
the
important
thing
about
the
effect
of
a
levy
is
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
it
means
that
the
government
has
virtually
all
rights
to
the
property
except
a
few
narrow
rights.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
all
the
case
could
have...
could
have
said,
but
the
court
went
on
and
discussed
what
the
effect
of
a
levy
was,
and
it
said
basically
that
the
levy
therefore
gave
the
united
states
full
legal
right
to
the
$38,000
levied
upon
as
against
the
claim
for
the
petitioner
receiver.
now,
that
to
us
is
very
significant,
and
when
you
take
that
recognition
as
to
what
the
effect
of
a
levy
is,
and
you
consider
it
against...
in
the
context
and
in
the
perspective
of
the
new
bankruptcy
code
provisions,
i
think
the
answer
is
very
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
erred,
because
what
you
had...
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court,
if
i
may,
to
the
pertinent
provisions
of
statutory
the
language
needs
to
be
construed.
on
page
52-a,
and
53-a,
and
54-a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition,
the
pertinent
provisions
are
set
forth,
and
basically
we
start,
if
i
may,
on
page
54-a,
with
the
turnover
provision,
the
very
provision
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
was
applicable
here.
it
says
here,
"except
as
provided
in
subsection
c
or
d
of
this
section,
an
entity
in
possession,
custody,
or
control
during
the
case
of
property
that
the
trustee
may
use,
sell,
or
lease
under
section
363
of
this
title
shall
deliver
to
the
trustee.
"
now,
the
question...
the
irs
is
an
entity,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
property
that
the
trustee
may
use,
sell,
or
lease,
and
we
have
to
go
to
section
363.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
the
point...
the
point--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
let
me
go
on.
we
then
have
to
say
to
ourselves...
we
have
to
ask
ourselves,
what
is
the
property
that
the
trustee
can
use,
and
the
question
is,
under
section
363(b),
cited
on...
you
know,
set
out
on
page
52-a,
it
says,
"the
trustee,
after
notice
in
hearing,
may
use,
sell,
or
lease,
other
than
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
property
of
the
estate.
"
so
the
question
boils
down
to,
what
is...
if
this
is
not
property
of
the
estate,
it
is
not
subject
to
a
turnover
order.
and
section
541(a)
finally
defines
what
property
of
the
estate
is,
and
it
says--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--precisely,
and
it
would
have
been
paid
over.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
it
belongs
to
the
government.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
of
course
not.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
indeed--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
that
requires,
you
know,
questions
of
tracing
that
the
record
is
opaque
on,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
property
was
in
a
constructive
trust.
what
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
not
property
of
the
estate.
that
is,
you
know,
that
is
the
critical
aspect.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
don't...
we
are
not
putting
ourselves,
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
same
category
as
all
secured
creditors
generally.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
are
resting...
we
are
resting
on
the
exercise
of
our
rights
to
levy.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
makes...
let
me
suggest
that
it
makes
reorganization...
it
makes
reorganization
impossible
in
a
case
in
which
the
debtor,
like
in
this
case,
waits,
you
know,
and
does
not
pay
tax
obligations,
and
then
finally
the
internal
revenue
service
exercises
its
statutory
rights
to
levy,
and
then
it
goes
into
bankruptcy
court.
i
would
suggest
that
that
sequence
of
events
wouldn't
possibly
make
reorganization
impossible.
but
the
chronology
in
this
case
is
critical,
because--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--the
point
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
began
its
analysis
by
saying
that
there
was
this
turnover
authority
under
the
old
bankruptcy
law,
and
that
somehow
it
was
carried
forward.
we
don't
think
that
is
true,
but
that
is
not
critical
to
our
case,
because
even
if
it
were
carried
over,
we
don't
think
that,
you
know,
that
the
settled
rule
that
permit...
that
insulated
the
internal
revenue
service
from
turnover
with
respect
to
prepetition
tax
levied
property
has
been
altered
by
the
codification
of
the
bankrupty
code.
we
regard
that
rule
as
settled,
and
we
regard
the...
i
mean,
it
would
be
a
drastic
and
radical
departure
from
old
law
for
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
think
the
point--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
think
it
is
settled
because
no
one
ever
challenged
the
authority.
i
think
there
would
never
be
any--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
i
can--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
can
tell
you
that
in
investigating
the
history
of
this
case,
the
internal
revenue
service
assured
me
that
its
right
to
do
this
had
never
been
challenged,
and
that
it
had
done
it
on
a...
it
had
done
it
on
innumerable
cases.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
would
simply
suggest
that
the
absence
of
authority
suggests
that
the...
that
the
right
was
well
settled.
after
all,
the
statutory
authority
to
levy,
these
are
very
old
statutes,
and
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
apparently,
there
is--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
there
was
some
decisional
law
to
the
contrary,
but
that
really--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
indeed,
but
our
point
is
that
the
government
occupies
quite
a
different
position
than
an
ordinary
secured
creditor.
an
ordinary
secured
creditor
simply
has
a
security
interest.
take
a
mortgagee.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
let
me
say
this.
but
it
is
more
than
the
phelps
case,
because
section
541
defines
property
of
the
estate
as
all
legal
or
equitable
interests
of
the
debtor
in
property
as
of
the
commencement
of
the
case.
now,
the
question
is,
what
were
the
debtors'
interests
in
this
property
as
of
the
commencement
of
the
case,
the
day
that
it
filed
its
petition
for
reorganization,
and
under
section
6331(a)
the
levy
had
already
taken
place
and
the
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
are
absolutely
clear
that
under
those
circumstances
the
only...
the
only
property
interests
that
the
debtor
had
in
that
property
was
the
right
to
receive
notice
of
sale,
was
the
right
to
receive
possible
surplus.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
under--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
now,
i--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
ultimately
that
is
true,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
government
is
different
in
the
sense
that
congress
has
armed
the
government
with
statutory
authority
to
conduct
administrative
sales
without
any...
without
any
further
ado.
a
chattel
mortgagee,
i
would
suggest,
has
to
get
the
sheriff
to
come
and
seize
the
property.
it
can't
engage
in
self-help.
these--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
let
me
simply
say
this,
that
the
end
result
with
respect
to
a
secured
creditor
and
the
government
may
be
the
same
at
the
bottom
line
in
the
sense
that
the
debtor
will
be
entitled
to
surplus,
but
the
point
is
that
congress
has
made
a
determination
that
the
internal
revenue
service
and
its
prerogatives
are
to
be
treated
differently,
and
i
think
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
phelps,
because
what
the
court
said
there
was
that
the
service
of
a
notice
of
seizure
takes
the
property...
takes
the
legal
interest
of
the
property
and
puts
it
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
the
government
then
can
sell
it.
a
chattel
mortgagee
or
a
real
property
mortgagee
has
to
start
a
foreclosure
action.
the
government
is
not
simply
limited
in
tax
collection
proceedings
to
starting
a...
to
commencing
a
suit
to
foreclose.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's...
that
may
be
the
case,
but
i
am
simply
suggesting
to
the
court
that
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code,
there
is
just...
there
is
no
statutory
language
that
supports
the
notion
that
in
a
situation
like
this
when
the
irs
has
engaged
in
a
free
petition
levy,
that
such
property
is
subject
to
turnover.
it
is
a
drastic
change
from
what
we
regard
as
the
settled
rule
for
the
contrary,
as...
and
we
think
that
phelps
recognizes
that
there
was
such
a--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--under
state
law.
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
these
tax
moneys?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
corporation
had
title,
and
ultimately,
you
know,
there
is
no
money
now
in
the
account,
where
there
are...
are
inventory.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no.
absolutely
not.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
not,
but
our
argument,
as
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
know,
is
with
respect
to
all
taxes,
because
section
6331
empowers
the
internal
revenue
service
to
levy
on
assets
of
the
delinquent
taxpayer
any
time
there
is
unpaid
assets,
and
here
is
a
situation
where
these...
unpaid
tax
liabilities.
here
is
a
situation
where
these
things
went
unpaid
for
several
years.
the
government
finally
realized
that
it
was
not
going
to
get
paid
unless
it
took
these
involuntary
measures,
and
it
did
that,
and
the
fact
that
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
was
commenced
thereafter
to
us
is
critical,
because
it
suggests
that
under
the
pertinent
provisions,
this
property
that
was
seized,
this
inventory
was
not
property
of
the
estate.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that
the
scheme
of
the
law
that
respondent
has
described
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
was
simply
not
enacted
by
congress
when
it
codified
the
bankruptcy
code
in
1978.
our
critical
point
here
is
that
this
property
was
not
property
of
the
estate.
section
541,
the
precise
words
that
congress
used,
talked
about
all
legal
or
equitable
interests
of
the
debtor
in
property
as
of
the
commencement
of
the
case.
the
legislative
history
is
absolutely
clear
that
the
sponsors
determine
that
this
provision
was
not
to
expand
the
debtor's
rights
in
property
as
of
the
commencement
of
the
case.
the
question
before
the
court
is,
what
were
the
debtor's
rights
in
this
property
as
of
the
commencement
of
the
case.
to
that...
property
rights
are
not
defined
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
but
are
defined
either
under
state
law
or
in
this
case
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
to
that,
i
submit,
the
court
must
refer
to
section
6331(a),
et
cetera,
the
levy
provisions,
and
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
under
those
situations
the
debtor...
under
that
situation
the
debtor
had
very
limited
rights
under
this
to
this
property.
he
could
receive
notice
of
seizure.
he
could
receive
surplus
property,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
he
could
not
use,
sell,
or
lease
this
property
within
the
meaning
of
section
363(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
there...
his
right,
simply,
to
get
the
property
back,
he
had
to
pay
the
tax,
and
if
he
didn't
do
that,
the
irs,
without
any
further
ado,
without
resort
to
any
judicial
proceeding,
could
sell
the
property.
the
fact
that
this
may
thwart
the
rehabilitation
of
the
debtor
is
a
sorry
circumstance
in
this
case,
but
it
proceeds
on
the
basis
of
the
explicit
statutory
words
enacted
by
congress
in
the
legislative
history.
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
here
is
to
prescribe
a
rule
that
was
neither
enacted
by
congress
with
respect
to
secured
creditors
but
at
all
events
hardly
enacted
with
respect
to
the
internal
revenue
service's
statutory
collection
authority.
