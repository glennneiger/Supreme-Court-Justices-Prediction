i
mean,
you
said
that
you
thought
your
argument
was
primarily
based
on
the

this

you

mr.
smith,
all
of
your
tracing
through
these
statutory
sections
that
you
very
helpfully
took
us
through
a
few

there
is
nothing
peculiar
to
the

about
any
of

argument.
the
only
thing
peculiar
to
the

is
your
heavy
reliance
on

--well,
neither

you

mr.

do
you
understand
the

to
have
taken
the
position
that

have

been
describing

justice
william

that

really
a
fairly
important
and
rather

question

new
bankruptcy
act,
isn't
it?
justice

where

justice

mr.

to
your
