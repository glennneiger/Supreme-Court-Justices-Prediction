justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
but
that
may
be
against
the
judgment
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bankruptcy
court
lets
the
reorganization
petition
be
filed.
it
survives
motions
to
dismiss.
there
is...
that
requires
a
judgment
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
reorganization.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
only
got
phelps
to
defend
your
position
under
the
previous
chapter
10,
haven't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
wasn't
even
a
chapter
10
case.
give
me
a
chapter
10
case.
i
mean
the
old
chapter
10.
give
me
one
of
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bankruptcy
law...
chapter
10
had
been
on
the
books
a
long
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you
think
the
government
regularly
or
even
often
got
away
with
levying
on
property
that...
or
saying
that
they
didn't
have
to
turn
over
property
that
had
been
levied
on
in
that
chapter
10
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
what
the
practice
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
you
were
able
to
get
away
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
they
exercised
them.
and
did
bankruptcy
courts
always
say,
yes,
if
you
have
levied
before
a
chapter
10
petition
is
filed...
that's
the
old
chapter
10...
that
you
may
keep
the
property?
was
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
approving
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
every
other
secured
creditor
could
be
required
to
turn
it
over,
in
the
old
chapter
10.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
saying
now
that
one
of
your
arguments
is
that
the
new
bankruptcy
law
has
permitted
all
creditors
to
seize
property
before
the
petition
and
keep
it.
one
of
your
arguments
would--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
is
one
of
your
arguments
in
your
brief.
i
am
not
sure
it
is
the
principal
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
chapter
11.
that
was
an
old
chapter
11
case.
it
wasn't
a
bankruptcy...
it
wasn't
a
chapter
10
case,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
a
completely
different
operation
with
respect
to
secured
creditors.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
under
chapter
11.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
case
would
have
come
out
any
differently
in
phelps
if
it
had
been
a
non-government
creditor?
i
don't...
don't
you
think
any
other
secured
creditor
who
would
seize
property
ahead
of
the
bankruptcy
would
have
been
able
to
hold
it
under
chapter
11?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
phelps
couldn't
have
rested
on
the
special
position
of
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
a
mortgagee,
what
if
a
mortgagee
in
a
case
just
like
that
had
taken
possession
of
the
property
before
the
chapter
11
petition
had
been
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
could
have
turned,
been--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
a
chapter
11?
not
in
the
old--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
is
a
different
thing,
old
chapter
10.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
theory
that
you
have
just
been
talking
about
would
apply
to
all
creditors.
that
is
the
one
argument
that
you
make
in
your
brief,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
like
you
backed
off
from
that
argument
in
your
reply
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
not
very
well
settled
if
you
can't
give
me
any
cases
under
chapter
10,
on
the
old
law,
if
you
can't
even
give
me
a
case
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
settled
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
i
know,
the
internal
revenue
service
never
attempted
it
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
can't
tell
me
that
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
hardly
answers
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
think
that
it
had
been
settled
with
respect
to
other
secured
creditors
under
chapter
10,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rule
is
quite
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
one
argument
that
the
government
might
make
that
says
that
the
tax
claim
is
different
from
other
secured
creditors
is
that...
at
least
you
submit
that
the
government's
interest
under
a
levy
is
determined
by
the
code,
whereas
other
secured
creditors'
interests
very
likely
would
be
determined
under
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
would
apply
to
all
creditors.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
law
was
under
chapter
10,
the
old
chapter
10,
with
just
an
ordinary
secured
creditor
who
has
taken
possession
immediately
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition?
isn't
that
subject
to
summary
turnover?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
wasn't
subject
to
summary
turnover,
it
might
have
been
subject
to
turnover
in
a
plenary
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
trustee
in
the
old
chapter
10
could
collect
those
kinds
of
assets.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
know
of
any
cases
dealing
specifically
with
property
held...
prior
to
a
chapter
10
reorganization
held
by
the
government
under
a
levy?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
just
weren't
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
you
certainly
may.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
was
a
case...
was
it
started
out
a
chapter
10
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
started
out
a
straight
bankruptcy
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
even...
that
is
a
fortiori
then
from
a
chapter
11.
i
mean,
an
ordinary
bankruptcy,
if
some
secured
creditor
had
taken
possession,
the
trustee
could
never
get
it
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
phelps
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
that
would
have
been
the
case
if
the
non-tax
secured
creditor
had
seized
physical
assets
and
were
holding
them
pursuant
to
a
lien.
