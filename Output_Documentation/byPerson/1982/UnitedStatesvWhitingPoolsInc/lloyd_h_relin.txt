mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
the
view
of
the
respondent
that
the
decision
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
not
only
based
on
sound
statutory
analysis,
but
that
of
equal
importance,
it
was
grounded
in
common
sense.
on
the
other
hand,
we
believe
the
government's
proposed
plain
language
interpretation
of
turnover
under
the
bankruptcy
code--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--yes,
indeed.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
it
would
not
be
property
of
the
estate.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
well,
perhaps--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--but
it
certainly
would
be
a
violation
of
trust,
and--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--yes.

[generallaughter.]
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
presumes
that
there
was
in
fact
such
a
fund
in
existence
at
some
point
in
time.
in
fact,
withholding
taxes--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--that's
true.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
no
question
about
it.
and
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest
in
any
way
that
it
was
inappropriate
that
it
was
not
there.
of
course,
the
money
should
have
been
accumulated
and
paid.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
well,
i
think
the
way
the
statutory
construction
is
of
the
bankruptcy
code
is
that
if
in
fact
a
fund
exists
and
can
be
traced,
and
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
indicate
that
tracing
should
be
allowed
a
fairly
liberal
course--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--no,
that
the
money
does
not
belong
to
the
debtor
if
it
can
be
traced,
and
the
sponsors
make
it
clear
that
the
government
is
to
be
given
leeway
by
the
court
to
attempt
to
do
such
a
tracing,
if
at
all
possible,
but
that
was
not
attempted
to
be
done
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
counsel
has
indicated
that
this
tax
had
accrued
over
a
period
of
a
couple
of
years.
so
there
was
no
fund
in
existence.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
cash
or
fund
in
existence
was
$15,000,
not
$20,000,
that
was
on
deposit
in
a
bank
account,
and
that
had
in
fact
been
levied
upon
by
the
government
prior
to
the
levy
on
the
tangible
property,
which,
incidentally,
was
primarily
construction
equipment
and
vehicles,
by
and
large,
and
the
company
had
owned
those
for
a
substantial
period
of
years.
so
there
is
no
direct
relation
between
the
unpaid
tax
liabilities
and
the
property
itself
that
was
seized.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
well,
it
did,
justice
blackmun,
at
least
on
the
day
that
it
was
filed.
however,
the
fact
that
we
were
able
to
file
it
within
one
day
occurred
because
it
had
already
been
planned,
but
simply
not
put
into
execution.
the
government
pre-empted
us
in
that
regard.
the
government's
plain
language
interpretation
assumes
or
argues
that
turnover
applies
only
to
interest
rather
than
to
the
items
of
property
which
are
subject
to
such
interest
and
a
basis--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
that's
correct.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
the
court
did
so
find.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
oh,
yes.
there
was
an
evidentiary
hearing
with
testimony
as
to
values.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
only
by
$70,000.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
yes.
the
argument
that
turnover
only
applies
to
possessory
interest
or
to
interests
in
property
rather
than
property
would
mean
that
the
trustee
would
be
entitled
to
obtain
turnover
under
section
542(a)
of
the
possessory
interest
in
property
which
he
already
has,
assuming
he
does
have
such
an
interest,
but
not
the
item
of
property
itself
if
that
item
happened
to
be
held
by
someone
else.
clearly,
such
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
absurd
and
could
not
be
seriously
advanced
by
the
government
in
this
case.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
absolutely.
as
you
indicated
in
your
questioning,
justice
white,
and
we
do
agree
that
these
sections
are
of
general
application
to
all
cases
in
bankruptcy.
the
word
"turnover"
implies
in
most
instances
a
physical
act
with
respect
to
a
particular
item
of
property.
therefore,
it
seems
logical
that
section
542(a)
must
deal
with
the
item
of
property
itself,
not
merely
with
interests
of
various
parties
in
that
item
of
property.
however,
the
government
says
that
the
remedy
of
turnover
is
not
available
unless
the
debtor
would
have
had
the
right
of
possession
absent
the
pendency
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
in
other
words,
the
government
believes
that
section
542(a)
has
no
independent
remedial
function,
but
merely
codifies
the
power
of
the
court
to
compel
a
third
party
to
turn
over
to
the
trustee
property
which
the
third
party
is
not
otherwise
legally
entitled
to
retain,
even
absent
the
pendency
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
such
a
turnover
power
existed
as
a
judicially
created
adjunct
to
the
bankruptcy
court's
summary
jurisdiction,
but
it
was
not
available
for
use
against
a
creditor
adversely
in
possession
under
a
claim
of
right
except
in
reorganizations,
as
i
will
subsequently
discuss.
on
the
other
hand,
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
would
appear
that
the
turnover
power
extends
to
property
adversely
held
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition.
such
an
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
legislative
history,
where
property
of
the
estate
is
interpreted
according
to
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
as
including
"property
recovered
by
the
trustee
under
section
542,
if
the
property
recovered
was
merely
out
of
the
possession
of
the
debtor,
yet
remained
property
of
the
debtor.
"
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
i
understand
them
to
have
taken
that
position
with
respect
to
a
reorganization.
i
don't
think
they--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--yes,
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
because,
of
course,
we
are
dealing
with
a
reorganization
case
here,
but
i
think
because
the
section
itself,
542(a),
is
one
of
the
sections
of
general
application,
then,
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
such
an
interpretation
would
be
possible.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
it
absolutely
is,
and
i
don't
really
purport
to
give
an
overall
response
to
that,
although
it
may
be--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--yes.
there
was
a
fairly
extensive
developed
body
of
law.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
it
certainly
might
have
been.
the--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--absolutely
could,
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
developed
law
that--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--absolutely
not.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
no,
there
never
were,
and
i
would
like
to
correct
you,
justice
white,
in
one
minor
respect,
if
i
might.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
phelps
was
a
liquidation
case.
it
was
not
a
chapter
11
case.
the
only
chapter
11
case
that
i
am
aware
of
whatsoever
was
the
case
of
pittsburgh
penguin
partners.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
phelps?
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
no.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
it
was
not
only
straight,
but
it
was
an
involuntary
bankruptcy.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
yes.
in
a
straight
bankruptcy--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--or
in
chapter
11.
which
it
was.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
absolutely
was,
and
that
certainly
is
our
position
with
regard
to
phelps.
i
think
that
in
order
to
understand
the
significance
of
section
542,
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
section
543
as
well
as
section
542,
because
they
are
companion
sections.
the
case
law
which
had
developed
under
the
act
had
distinguished
between
equity
receivers
holding
property
for
creditors
generally
and
for
closure
receivers
holding
property
for
a
particular
creditor.
although
both
types
of
receivers
were
required
to
turn
over
such
property
in
a
chapter
10
reorganization,
only
equity
receivers
were
required
to
turn
over
to
a
straight
bankruptcy
liquidation
trustee.
section
543
of
the
bankruptcy
code
applicable
to
custodians
by
its
terms
clearly
seems
to
encompass
both
equity
and
foreclosure
receivers.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
well,
it
would
be,
i
am
fairly
certain,
in
the
government's
appendix.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
now,
the
essence
of
543
seems
to
be
that
there
must
be
turnover
by
any
party
holding
property
which
was
once
the
debtor's
or
proceeds
of
that
property
if
the
party
holding
the
party
or
the
proceeds
holds
it
for
the
benefit
of
some
other
party,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
that
other
party
is
just
one
creditor
or
all
creditors
of
the
debtor.
section
542(a),
on
the
other
hand,
provides
for
turnover
from
parties
other
than
custodians.
if
both
traditional
equity
and
foreclosure
receivers
are
custodians,
obviously,
section
542(a)
applies
to
someone
else.
in
our
opinion,
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
someone
else
includes
a
creditor
who
is
in
self-possession
of
assets
of
the
debtor's
property.
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
section
257,
in
corporate
reorganizations,
and
section
507,
in
real
property
arrangements--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--yes.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
yes,
may
use,
sell,
or
lease
under
section
363.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
not
that
property,
but
the
property
that
was
seized
here
by
the
government,
absolutely.
just
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
certain
dollar
amount
for
one
category
and
a
tax
of
$92,000
does
not
mean
equipment
that
had
been
purchased
years
earlier
by
the
debtor
would
do
that.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
well,
there
is
an
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
perhaps
the
courts
should
assume
that
the
last
money
in
bank
accounts
is
in
fact
trust
funds.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
yes,
that
is
really
a
constructive
trust
argument,
or
resulting
trust,
perhaps,
in
a
traditional
sense,
but
not
in
the
case
of
tangible
property.
in
any
event,
both
257
and
section
507
of
the
act
require
turnover
by
a
trustee
under
a
trust
deed
or
a
mortgagee
under
a
mortgage.
both
creditors
were
creditors
who
were
in
self-possession
of
the
debtor's
property.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
absolutely.
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
real
dispute
about
that,
your
honor.
they
may
trace
as
far
as
they
possibly
can
and--
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
--not
in
this
case.
it
is
our
belief
that
the
cases
that
have
developed
under
chapter
10
and
under
chapter
12
and
primarily,
of
course,
the
case
of
reconstruction
finance
corporation,
on
which
the
second
circuit
placed
great
reliance,
that
those
cases
have
been
carried
forward
into
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
those
cases
would
not
appear
in
section
543.
we
believe
they
were
carried
forward
into
section
542(a).
the
reason
for
this
can
be
seen
from
the
historical
analysis
that
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
followed.
there
was
considerable
testimony
adduced
in
the
house
and
also
in
the
senate
where
many
parties
testifying
expressed
concern
that
the
original
custodial
provision,
turnover
from
a
custodian
under
the
earlier
drafts
of
the
bankruptcy
code
did
not
provide
for
turnover
by
a
creditor
in
self-possession
of
the
debtor's
assets.
following
that
testimony,
the
redrafted
house
bill,
h.r.
6,
was
introduced
which
contained
section
542(a)
in
its
present
form.
and
we
believe
that
this
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
incorporating
the
decisional
rule
of
law
that
had
developed
in
many
cases,
not
just
reconstruction
finance,
but
in
re
prudence
bonds,
grand
boulevard
investment,
third
avenue
transit,
colonial
realty,
and
so
on.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
well,
that
particular
issue
was
dealt
with
in
various
other
cases
in
other
categories,
although
i
think,
as
far
as
i
know,
reconstruction
finance
was
the
only
case
that
actually
dealt
with
inventory,
which
was
the
seized
assets
in
that
particular
case.
we
believe
that
by
keying
section
542(a)
to
the
sale,
use,
or
lease
of
property
under
section
363,
congress
intended
to
enable
a
trustee
or
reorganizing
debtor
to
acquire
possession
of
needed
property
in
which
the
interest
of
the
estate
is
not
inconsequential,
so
long
as
the
interests
of
the
party
in
possession
of
the
property
can
be
judicially
determined
to
be
adequately
protected.
section
363(e)
mandates
an
adequate
protection
hearing
upon
the
request
of
the
affected
creditor,
and
in
the
case
of
the
proposed
turnover
of
cash
collateral,
section
363
mandates
such
a
hearing.
in
either
case,
the
trustee
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
protection
offered
is
adequate.
turnover
is
required
under
section
542(a)
of
property
that
the
trustee
can
use,
sell,
or
lease...
it
is
a
disjunctive
that
is
used...
under
section
363.
although
the
government
has
concentrated
its
analysis
on
subsections
(b)
and
(c),
subsection
(f)(5)
of
section
363
permits
a
trustee
to
sell
property
either
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
or
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
business
free
and
clear
of
the
interest
of
any
other
entity
in
the
property
if
"such
entity
could
be
compelled
in
a
legal
or
equitable
proceeding
to
accept
a
money
satisfaction
of
such
interest.
"
clearly,
this
is
the
case
with
respect
to
the
interest
of
the
irs
in
all
of
the
property
that
it
seized
from
whiting,
as
the
government
has
no
interest
in
the
property
except
to
get
paid.
therefore,
as
whiting
could
sell
the
property
under
section
363
at
(5),
it
is
entitled
to
turn
over
under
section
542(a).
conceding
that
section
542
might
require
turnover
by
a
private
creditor
in
possession
of
assets,
the
government
nonetheless
attempts
to
exclude
itself
from
the
application
of
that
rule.
in
essence,
the
government's
argument
takes
the
following
pattern.
there
existed
pre-bankruptcy
code
prior
decisional
law
governing
the
effect
of
pre-bankruptcy
tax
levies.
nothing
in
the
congressional
history
specifically
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
change
that
prior
law.
therefore,
congress
did
not
change
the
prior
law.
the
government's
syllogism
fails,
however,
of
its
own
accord,
because
it
is
based
on
a
false
major
premise.
according
to
the
government's
argument,
pre-bankruptcy
code
decisional
law
held
that
the
government
was
not
required
to
surrender
to
the
trustee
for
inclusion
in
the
bankruptcy
estate
property
seized
prior
to
bankruptcy
to
satisfy
delinquent
taxes.
that
is
the
wording
in
the
government's
reply
brief.
but
there
is
no
case
cited
by
the
government
as
prior
law
under
the
bankruptcy
act
which
held
that
the
government
could
not
be
compelled
to
turn
over
to
a
reorganization
trustee
tangible
property
seized
in
a
pre-petition
tax
levy
which
had
not
been
sold
at
the
time
of
the
petition.
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
pittsburgh
penguin
partners
case,
all
of
the
prior
law
cases
concerned
the
government's
seizure
of
intangible
property
and
its
right
to
retain
that
property
against
a
liquidation
trustee.
pittsburgh
penguin
partners,
however,
which
was
a
chapter
11
case,
is
not
even
prior
law
as
it
was
decided
by
the
third
circuit
in
1979,
one
year
after
the
bankruptcy
code
had
been
enacted.
moreover,
the
decisions
in
american
acceptance
corporation
versus
glendora
and
in
re
chantler
baking
company,
both
cited
by
them
as
part
of
this
prior
law,
were
published
on
march
30,
1977,
and
july
18,
1977,
respectively,
several
months
after
the
introduction
of
h.r.
6
on
january
4,
1977,
which
already
contained
section
542(a)
in
its
present
form.
recognizing
as
it
must
that
all
of
the
prior
cases
arose
in
liquidations
where
the
existence
of
a
bona
fide
adverse
claim
to
the
property
defeated
summary
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
and
would
have
done
so
for
a
private
creditor
in
adverse
possession
as
well
as
for
the
government,
the
government
seeks
to
extend
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
liquidation
cases
to
broader
application
by
arguing
that
the
prior
cases
really
held
that
a
tax
levy
in
and
of
itself
effected
a
transfer
of
ownership
to
the
government
of
the
property
levied
upon.
but
in
actuality,
the
only
cases
which
would
be
prior
law
that
dealt
with
that
particular
subject
are
only
three
cited
by
the
government,
united
states
versus
eiland,
a
fourth
circuit
1955
case,
united
states
versus
sullivan,
a
third
circuit
1964
case,
and
this
court's
decision
in
phelps
versus
united
states.
eiland
concerned
a
prepetition
levy
on
an
account
receivable
which
belonged
to
the
bankrupt.
the
court
analogized
the
levy
to
a
private
creditor's
attachment
and
garnishment,
and
held
that
the
effect
of
the
federal
taxing
statutes
was
to
create
a
statutory
attachment
and
garnishment
resulting
in
a
"virtual
transfer"
to
the
government
of
the
right
to
receive
payment
of
the
debt.
clearly,
the
court
would
have
held
the
same
way
for
a
private
attaching
creditor.
united
states
versus
sullivan
concerned
a
prepetition
levy
on
two
insurance
companies
to
obtain
the
benefits
under
the
policies
of
a
living
tax
delinquent
policyholder.
although
the
court
on
the
authority
of
eiland
states
that
a
validly
invoked
seizure
is
"tantamount
to
a
transfer
of
ownership.
"
and
those
words
have
been
carried
on
in
the
subsequent
decisions
dealing
with
this
issue
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
court
nonetheless
goes
on
in
sullivan
to
hold
just
the
opposite.
it
held
that
by
the
mere
act
of
levying,
the
government
was
not
entitled
to
have
the
insurance
policies
cancelled
for
their
cash
values,
as
the
levy
did
not
dress
the
government
with
all
of
the
rights
of
the
policyholder.
in
so
holding,
the
court
stated,
"but
implicit
in
the
statute,
the
internal
revenue
code,
is
the
principle
that
the
commissioner
acts
pursuant
to
the
collection
process
in
the
capacity
of
lienor
as
distinguished
from
owner.
"
"moreover,
nowhere
in
the
code
is
there
a
provision
granting
to
the
commissioner
power
over
property
interests
of
delinquents
comparable
to
that
given
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
"
the
last
case
that
is
left
is
phelps,
and
we
have
already
discussed
that
to
some
extent.
most
significantly,
and
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
comment
on
phelps
to
the
court
at
this
time,
is
that
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
the
government's
overreliance
on
phelps
when
one
considers
that
the
holding
most
likely
would
have
been
the
same,
in
favor
of
a
secured
creditor
who
had
taken
steps
to
recover
the
funds
at
issue
from
the
assignee
for
benefit
of
creditors
had
the
funds
been
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
assets,
subject
to
the
creditor's
security
interest,
rather
than
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
assets
subject
to
the
government's
unfiled
tax
lien.
mr.
lloyd
h.
relin
yes.
exactly.
and
the
rationale
in
phelps
is
identical.
although
the
language
may
appear
somewhat
overbroad
taken
out
of
context,
in
context,
it
makes
absolute
good
sense.
all
in
all,
then,
it
is
our
opinion
that
prior
decisional
law
did
not
establish
a
rule
that
property
seized
by
prepetitioned
tax
levy
was
never
subject
to
post-bankruptcy
turnover.
rather,
the
cases
simply
held
that
the
government
did
not
have
to
turn
over
seized
assets
in
circumstances
where
a
private
creditor
exercising
equivalent
lien
rights
would
not
have
had
to
do
so.
the
true
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
the
treatment
of
the
internal
revenue
service
as
a
creditor
under
the
bankruptcy
code
can
best
be
seen
by
the
provisions
of
section
106(c)(1),
which
in
waiving
the
government's
sovereign
immunity
makes
it
clear
that
any
provision
of
the
code
applicable
to
an
entity
such
as
section
542(a),
which
specifically
applies
to
entities,
applies
to
"governmental
units".
as
the
irs
is
by
far
the
federal
governmental
unit
most
frequently
involved
in
bankruptcy
cases,
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
the
irs
to
be
included
in
section
542(a)
turnovers,
not
excluded,
as
the
government
here
suggests.
in
conclusion,
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
a
statute
should
be
construed
so
as
to
achieve
its
purpose,
that
a
reform
act,
such
as
the
bankruptcy
reform
act
of
1978,
should
be
permitted
wherever
possible
to
simplify
and
modernize
the
law
of
bankruptcy
in
conformity
with
the
developing
law
in
the
field,
and
that
effect
should
be
given
to
the
avowed
intent
of
the
legislative
sponsors
to
enact
legislation
that
"encourages
business
reorganizations
by
a
streamlined
new
commercial
reorganization
chapter
that
will
protect
the
investing
public,
protect
jobs,
and
help
save
troubled
businesses.
"
we
believe
that
the
position
taken
by
the
government
in
this
case
is
regressive
and
in
conflict
with
the
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code.
we
respectfully
submit
that
a
decision
in
this
case
in
favor
of
the
government
will
thwart
the
independent
functioning
of
the
bankruptcy
system
in
reorganization
cases
by
constituting
the
irs
a
censor
of
prospective
chapter
11
cases
in
which
it
might
be
involved
as
a
creditor,
with
the
power
to
virtually
veto
reorganization
by
seizing
assets
before
petitions
can
be
filed.
it
will
encourage
the
irs
to
seize
first
and
negotiate
later.
bankruptcy
courts
will
be
powerless
to
preserve
the
assets
of
debtors
under
their
jurisdiction
against
forced
liquidation
even
if
the
value
of
the
assets
at
fair
market
exceeds
the
tax
debt
many
times
over.
such
a
result,
we
believe,
could
not
have
been
intended
by
congress.
we
trust
it
will
not
be
permitted
by
this
court.
thank
you.
