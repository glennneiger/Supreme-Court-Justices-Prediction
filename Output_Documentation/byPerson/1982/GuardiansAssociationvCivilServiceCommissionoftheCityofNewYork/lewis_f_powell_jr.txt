mr.
crowley,
do
you
think
we
have
to
decide
the
private
cause
of
action
issue
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know
it
was
not
granted.
but
is
there
a
lawsuit
unless
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
your
answer?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
would
suggest
that
we
do
have
to
decide
that
issue.
i
don't
know.
i'm
interested
in
your
view.
well,
certainly
we
wouldn't
be
precluded
from
deciding
it,
because
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
argue
it
to
sustain
the
judgment.
