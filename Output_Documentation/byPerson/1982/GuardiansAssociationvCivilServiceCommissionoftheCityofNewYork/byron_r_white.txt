justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you've
cited
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
we
can
find
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
other
evidence
of
the
agencies'
interpretation
other
than
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
and
congress
then...
as
far
as
ratification
is
concerned,
you
just
rely
on
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
disagree
or
perhaps
approved
of
the
existing
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
just
asked,
whether
there--
justice
byron
r.
white
--was
any
evidence
other
than
the
regulations.
is
there
some
evidence
of
enforcement
policies
independent
of
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history?
you
say
there
was
ratification.
is
there
any
express
language
in
that
legislative
history
where
committees
recognized
or
purported
to
recognize
that
an
impact
standard
was
what
was
being
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
issue
here
a
private
cause
of
action
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
the
issue...
but
the
issue
is
here,
then?
i
mean,
you
say
that
if
the
issue
is
here
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action.
but
is
that
question
properly
before
us,
whether
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
respondent
privileged
to
rely
on...
to
try
to
have
the
judgment
sustained
by
arguing
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
we
thought
1983
doesn't
really
dispose
of
it,
when
we
had
to
get
to
the
statute,
of
course
congress
could
in
title
vi
have
relied
exclusively
on
administrative
enforcement
wholly
aside
from
1983.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
have
held
that
congressional
provisions
for
an
administrative
enforcement
supplant
even
1983.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
relying
on
1983
doesn't
conclusively
establish
your
cause
of
action,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
congress
could
have
intended
to
provide
an
exclusive
remedy.
