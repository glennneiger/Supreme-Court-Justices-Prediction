mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
chief
judge
and
other
honorable
members
of
this
court:
at
the
outset
we
note
that,
while
we
did
not
raise
the
issue
of
whether
there's
an
implied
right
to
sue
under
title
vi
because
we
weren't
aggrieved
by
the
lower
court
decision
since
we
had
won
on
that
issue,
it
is
before
this
court.
and
we
recognize
that
in
cannon
this
court
indicated
there
probably
is
an
implied
right,
but
it
took
pains
to
distinguish
title
ix
from
title
vi
on
the
ground
that
at
the
time
title
ix
was
enacted
the
legislators
assumed
that
there
was
a
private
right,
and
not
whether
or
not
in
fact
under
title
vi
there
was.
we
will
not
discuss
it
in
depth
except
to
call
to
your
attention
that
particular
issue.
what
is
conspicuous
about
the
petitioner's
argument,
both
in
the
briefs
and
on
oral
presentation,
is
the
absence
of
any
of
the
legislative
history
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
in
1964.
we
do
not
disagree
that
some
of
the
regulations
after
'64
have
in
effect
stated
it,
but
our
position
is
that
a
regulation
which
makes
impermissible
that
which
the
legislative
history
intends
to
be
legal
is
a
regulation
that
is
illegal
and
has
gone
too
far
and
is
not
reasonably
related.
in
1964
when
president
kennedy
was
addressing
the
legislature,
he
asked
them
to
pass
laws
that
would
make
illegal
what
was
formerly
not
being
enforced
under
the
constitution.
each
of
the
floor
leaders
both
in
the
house
and
the
senate
made
clear
and
unambiguous
statements
in
support
of
title
vi,
which
was
a
general
funding
provision,
that
the
whole
purpose
of
that
particular
title
was
to
establish
a
mechanism
to
enforce
the
constitution.
prior
to
1963,
with
the
exception
of
brown
against
the
board
of
education,
each
of
the
courts,
including
this
court,
was
troubled
by
the
breadth
of
the
constitutional
clause.
indeed,
despite
the
court's
decisions
and
appellate
courts'
decisions,
there
was
some
question
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
was
being
enforced.
as
a
consequence,
hubert
humphrey
and
emanuel
celler,
the
floor
leader,
both
felt
the
need
to
pass
title
vi,
so
that
if
a
particular
entity
is
violating
the
constitution,
that
entity
will
not
be
eligible
for
federal
funds.
a
peculiar
anomaly
existed
where
you
had
entities
that
were
not
state
entities,
and
therefore
not
subject
to
the
state
action
exception
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
so
if
an
entity
was
not
a
state
entity
and
received
funds,
there
was
some
doubt
on
the
executive
level
whether
they
could
cut
off
the
federal
funding.
hubert
humphrey
mentioned
the
different
areas
which
the
title
vi
legislation
was
supposed
to
involve.
one
was
the
distribution
of
food,
the
distribution
of
welfare
benefits,
the
allocation
of
funding
to
segregated
facilities
in
the
south
despite
this
court's
decision
in
brown
against
the
board
of
education.
and
in
particular
what
was
most
galling
was
the
allocation
of
funding
to
hospitals
which
were
operated
on
a
segregated
basis,
but
apparently
under
the
law,
even
though
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
could
receive
federal
funding.
the
particular
case
which
was
among
the
cases
which
motivated
the
title
vi
legislation
was
simkins
versus
moses
cone,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
in
simkins,
it
was
a
challenge
to
the
hill-burton
act,
which
was
ultimately
found
unconstitutional.
but
what
troubled
the
court
in
simkins,
where
cert
was
denied
by
this
court,
was
whether
there
was
sufficient
state
action
for
which
the
court
could
apply
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
did
conclude
there
was
sufficient
state
action,
but
in
another
case
where
you
didn't
have
the
sufficient
state
action
the
federal
government
would
be
powerless
to
cut
off
the
federal
funding.
the
legislation
was
clear
and
unambiguous.
more
importantly,
the
cases,
which
the
legislators
are
presumed
to
know,
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
all
support
our
construction.
there
was
akins,
there
were
jury
selection
cases,
there
were
the
desegregation
cases,
wright
against
rockefeller.
each
case
dealt
with
purposeful
discrimination
where
it
was
incumbent
upon
a
plaintiff
to
show
that
the
actions
of
the
government
intended
to
treat
one
group
differently
from
another.
and
that
is
why
title
vi
was
enacted.
it
was
precisely
for
that
reason,
to
set
up
a
mechanism
by
which
you
can
stop
the
federal
funding.
reference
has
been
made
to
the
fact
that,
with
respect
to
the
regulations,
why
delegation
was
given
because
the
president
was
required
to
review
each
of
the
regs.
the
reason
that
the
president
was
given
this
authority
was
so
that
the
regulations
would
have
a
harmonious
view
of
what
constituted
constitutional
violation,
and
it
was
hoped
that
one
agency
wouldn't
cut
off
funds
on
a
different
interpretation
of
the
constitution
than
another
agency.
and
indeed,
it
was
contemplated
by
the
legislators
that
the
constitutional
definition
of
the
equal
protection
clause
would
be
an
evolving
definition,
and
that
what
was
a
violation
at
one
point
may
not
be
a
violation
later.
but
the
only
purpose
of
title
vi
was
to
conform
its
standards
with
respect
to
the
constitution.
we
believe
that
the
majority
opinion
in
bakke
supports
this
conclusion,
and
while
it
is
true
that
bakke--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--well,
insofar
as
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
title
vi.
there
were
at
least
five
judges
that
commented
on
the
legislative
history,
and
as
to
the
five
judges
there
was
a
structured
approach.
the
first
issue
was,
what
was
the
scope
of
title
vi.
the
second
issue
was,
assuming
that
title
vi
was
a
constitutional
scope,
whether
or
not
reverse
discrimination
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
through
title
vi.
so
i
am
talking
only
about
the
majority
opinion
insofar
as
it
analyzed
the
scope
of
title
vi.
i
recognize
that
there
were
different
opinions
with
respect
to
whether
reverse
discrimination
is
within
the
ambit
of
title
vi.
petitioners
have
cited
title
iv
in
support
of
their
position
because
they
claim
that
there
congress
made
reference
to
the
constitution
and
therefore
the
failure
to
make
reference
to
the
constitution
in
title
vi
is
significant.
title
iv,
to
the
contrary,
supports
our
position.
in
title
iv
the
attorney
general
is
given
the
authority
to
investigate
and
prosecute
claims
of
desegregation
upon
claims
of
individuals
who
are
alleging
constitutional
violations.
but
that
title
assumes
a
constitutional
standard.
the
reference
to
the
constitutional
limitation
is
in
the
context
of
what
remedy
the
attorney
general
can
seek
under
title
iv,
and
in
that
respect
he
is
limited
to
the
extent
that
he
cannot
seek
a
remedy
of
busing
and
he
cannot
seek
any
other
remedy
that'll
go
beyond
the
constitution.
if
it
wasn't
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
the
attorney
general's
jurisdiction,
there
would
have
been
no
reference
to
the
constitution
and
the
constitutional
standard
would
have
been
assumed.
in
addition,
petitioner
claims
that
you
have
an
anomaly
in
that
municipal
corporations
were
excluded
from
title
vii
and
that
there
is
therefore
a
different
test,
in
that
if
they
discriminate
they
are
subject
to
a
less
stringent
standard
under
title
vi
than
title
vii.
that's
specifically
what
congress
intended.
if
indeed
it
was
intended
to
have
the
same
standard
both
under
title
vii
and
under
title
vii,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
exclude
governmental
entities
from
title
vii,
and
those
entities
were
not
included
until
1972
after
a
great
deal
of
debate.
in
addition,
with
respect
to
municipal
corporations,
they
were
immune
from
suit
under
1983
under
monroe
versus
pape,
which
was
familiar
to
the
legislators
in
congress
at
the
time
of
enactment.
can
it
be
said
that
it
is
likely
that
congress,
without
anything
in
the
legislative
history,
would
have
made
municipalities
subject
to
an
impact
standard
with
the
resultant
potential
loss
of
federal
funding,
after
they
had
been
immune
under
1983,
without
any
comment
to
that
effect
in
the
entire
legislative
history?
and
the
answer
we
believe
is
that
it
would
be
very
unlikely.
the
1965
amendment
which
the
petitioners
refer
to
was
an
amendment
that
contained
many
different
pieces,
one
of
which
was
to
establish
an
intent
standard.
but
the
proponent
of
that
amendment,
emanuel
celler,
indicated
that
he
was
putting
it
in
only
to
clarify
what
he
believed
was
already
there,
a
constitutional
standard.
more
importantly,
there
were
other
factors
within
that
amendment.
that
amendment
contained
different
procedures
for
title
vi.
it
allowed
an
entity
receiving
federal
funds
to
waive
the
receipt
to
be
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
agencies
enforcing
title
vi.
and
finally,
it
restricted
the
ability
of
the
agencies,
even
where
there
was
a
violation.
so
when
that
amendment
failed
passage
both
in
the
house
and
the
senate,
the
reason
for
its
failure
was
unclear.
and
as
this
court
has
remarked
many
times,
any
reason
to
attribute
to
its
failure
would
be
sheer
speculation.
again,
the
only
thing
that
supports
the
petitioners'
position
are
the
regulations
that
were
passed
subsequent
to
1964.
indeed,
there
is
doubt
as
to
whether
those
regulations
were
enforced.
the
only
case
commenting
on
the
regulations
was
brown
against
weinberger
and
the
comment
generally
was
that
the
agencies
hadn't
enforced
it.
and
if
you
review
the
cases
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
after
'64
and
before
this
court's
decision
in
lau
against
nichols,
you
will
see
consistently
that
the
courts
applied
an
intent
standard
and
therefore
they
did
not
believe
the
regulations
could
change
the
law.
as
we
indicated
in
the
outset
of
our
argument--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--no.
they
used
the
reference--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--washington
versus
davis.
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
no,
no.
the
only
reference
they
used
was
constitutional
standard,
and
they
were
prepared
to
incorporate
the
standard
whether
it
included
intent
or
effect.
they
didn't
define
it
in
such
manner.
in
sum,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
language
and
the
history
was
clear
and
articulate,
that
the
state
of
mind
of
the
legislators
at
that
time
was
only
to
redress
the
obvious
wrongs
created
by
intentional
segregation.
there
was
no--
mr.
leonard
j.
koerner
--that's
right.
there
was
no
refinement
with
respect
to
intent
versus
impact.
the
impact
refinement
was
a
judicial
gloss
put
on
by
this
court
in
griggs
against
duke
power
solely
with
respect
to
one
portion
of
title
vii
with
regard
to
testing,
where
the
language
indicated
that
it
would
be
illegal
to
use
a
competency
exam
unless
you
can
show
that
the
exam
wasn't
being
"used
to
discriminate".
the
term
"used"
was
defined
to
create
an
impact
standard.
it's
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
rest
of
title
vii
has
been
construed
to
have
an
intent
standard
with
respect
to
disparate
impact.
so
we're
talking
about
the
comparison
of
one
isolated
section
of
title
vii,
which
doesn't
result
in
the
calamitous
loss
of
federal
funding,
with
the
entire
title
vi
jurisdiction
with
the
administrative
procedure
which
contemplates
both
voluntary
compliance
and
a
cutback,
if
that
doesn't
work,
of
federal
funding.
we
believe
this
court's
decision
in
bakke
is
clear
and
its
intimation
in
board
of
education
versus
harris
that
indicated
that
bakke
had
so
held
the
constitutional
standard
is
correct.
and
we
ask
that
that
portion
of
the
circuit
court's
opinion
which
has
upheld
the
intent
standard
for
title
vi
be
affirmed.
