mr.
christopher
crowley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
our
case
presents
the
question
of
the
proper
interpretation
of
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act,
and
more
particularly
the
question
of
whether
congress
meant
in
1964
to
limit
regulatory
agencies
to
the
use
of
a
clear
intent
standard
or
whether
the
congress
contemplated
the
use
of
an
impact
approach,
at
least
so
far
as
defining
a
prima
facie
case
is
concerned.
our
case
was
brought
by
black
and
hispanic
policemen
alleging
that
entry
level
examinations
for
the
new
york
city
police
department
discriminated
in
their
effect
on
blacks
and
hispanics
and
that
they
were
not
job-related.
the
case
has
had
a
long
history,
but
the
relevant
facts
here
are
that
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
examinations
did
have
a
discriminatory
impact
on
blacks
and
hispanics.
it
also
held
that
they
were
not
job-related.
the
examinations
have
both
a
pass-fail
character...
one
has
to
pass
them
to
become
a
policemen;
everyone
in
our
case
did
pass
and
did
become
a
policeman...
but
they
are
also
used
as
the
sole
determinant
of
the
order
in
which
people
were
appointed
to
the
department,
which
made
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
our
case
because
the
exams
were
given
in
'68
to
1970
and
appointments
were
still
being
made
as
late
as
october
1974.
the
relevant
findings
were
that
there
was
a
disproportionate...
that
whites
were
three
times
as
likely
to
appear
in
the
top
two
deciles
as
were
the
black
applicants.
on
the
job-relatedness
question,
the
district
court
stressed
the
fact
that
there
had
been
no
job
analysis
to
see
what
it
was
that
the
exams
were
testing
for
and
that
therefore
the
exams
couldn't
be
validated.
it
was
important
to
make
a
finding
as
to
title
vi
because
some
members
of
the
class
would
not
be
entitled
to
relief
except
under
title
vi.
the
district
court
found
that
we
had
not
shown
a
showing
of
intent
necessary
to
make
out
a
1981
violation.
as
to
title
vi,
the
district
court
placed
considerable
reliance
on
the
regulations
which,
as
the
court
says,
were
full
of
language
that
evidences
an
intent
to
disallow
practices
with
a
discriminatory
impact,
and
of
course
the
district
court
placed
great
reliance
on
this
court's
unanimous
1974
decision
in
lau
v.
nichols.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
as
to
title
vii
and
reversed
as
to
title
vi,
relying
entire
on
language
of
opinions
in
the
bakke
case.
title
vi
was
passed
in
1964
as
part
of
the
comprehensive
civil
rights
act.
it
provides
in
section
601:
"no
person
shall,
on
the
grounds
of
race,
color
or
national
origin,
be
excluded
from
participation
in,
be
denied
the
benefits
of,
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination
under
any
program
with
federal
sponsorship.
"
section
602
mandates
that
the
federal
agencies
promulgate
affirmative
regulations
to
enforce
the
statute.
shortly
after
the
act
was
passed,
a
presidential
task
force
set
about
drafting
model
regulations.
five
months
later
in
december,
seven
federal
agencies
adopted
these
comprehensive
regulations.
they're
the
same
ones
at
issue
now.
they
were
the
ones
at
issue
in
lau.
thereafter,
a
total
of
some
52
federal
agencies
have
adopted
these
same
impact
regulations.
the
regulations
provide
in
relevant
part
here
that
they
prohibit
the
use
of
"criteria
or
methods
of
administration
which
have
the
effect
of
subjecting
persons
to
discrimination
or
which
have
the
effect
of
defeating
or
substantially
impairing
accomplishment
of
the
objectives
of
the
program.
"
in
our
brief
we
talk
about
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
in
my
brief
time
this
morning
i
would
like
to
stress
the
regulations
and
their
role
here.
the
one
thing
that
we
suggest
that
comes
across
clearly,
the
only
thing
that
comes
across
very
clearly
in
the
long
debate
about
title
vi,
is
that
there
was
a
very
broad
authorization
by
the
congress
to
the
federal
regulatory
agencies
to
draft
regulations
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
title
vi.
they're
unusual
in
that
they
required
affirmative
approval
by
the
president,
but
that
was
really
in
a
sense
an
index
of
how
important
they
were,
how
importantly
they
were
viewed
by
the
congress
at
the
time.
there
was
intense
debate
about
the
fact
that
title
vi
did
not
spell
out
in
more
detail
just
what
was
meant
by
discrimination
and
other
violations
of
the
statute.
senator
ervin
says
that
title
vi
leaves
it
to
the
agencies
to
define
discrimination
"without
any
guideline
whatever
to
point
out
what
is
the
congressional
intent.
"
the
house
minority
report
says:
"the
administration
tends
to
rely
on
its
own
construction
of
discrimination
as
including
a
lack
of
racial
balance.
"
senator
ervin,
when
questioning
attorney
general
robert
kennedy,
says
to
you:
"so
the
rules,
which
would
have
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
are
to
be
developed
first
in
the
minds
of
the
administrators
of
various
programs,
and
then
written
in
regulations
and
orders
issued
by
them?
"
attorney
general
kennedy:
"that
is
correct,
senator".
the
point
is
that
there
was
a
great
focus
on
the
breadth
of
the
authorization
by
the
congress
to
the
regulatory
agencies.
we
submit
in
the
first
instance
that
the
normal
rule
that
contemporaneous
regulations
adopted
pursuant
to
a
broad
authorization
like
this
are
entitled
to
great
deference
has
particularly
strong
application
here,
where
there
was
such
a
strong
focus
on
just
what
those
rules
and
regulations
were
going
to
say,
where
it
was
a
hot
issue
when
it
occurred,
when
there
was
a
debate
as
to
what
the
scope
of
those
regulations
could
say.
it's
also
important,
we
think,
to
express
the
fact
that
these
impact
regulations
have
been
ratified
by
the
congress
on
a
number
of
occasions.
in
1966
senator
ervin
and
others
who
had
been
serious
critics
of
the
1964
act
focused
on
the
impact
regulations
and
were
concerned
about
them.
there
was
an
amendment--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--they
are
not
quoted,
justice
stevens,
i'm
sorry
to
say.
there
is
a
reference
to
them
in--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--they're
not
set
out,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
christopher
crowley
not
in
full,
i'm
afraid,
no.
justice...
judge
carter
in
his
opinion
quotes
some
of
them
to
show
the
impact
language,
but
they're
not
set
out,
no.
mr.
christopher
crowley
we
have
cited
them,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
christopher
crowley
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
be
saddened
if
the
court
were
unable
to
find
them.
mr.
christopher
crowley
they're
not
set
out
in
detail
in
our
brief,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
christopher
crowley
the
relevant
impact
language
is
set
out
in
our
brief.
we
think
that
was
the
relevant
point.
that
was
the
part
that
judge
carter
relied
upon.
the
fact
that
impact
was
an
appropriate
approach
was
what
he
focused
on
when
the
case
went
back
to
see
if
title
vi
could
make
out...
one
could
make
out
a
case
under
title
vi.
as
i
say,
we
place
considerable
reliance,
and
suggest
that
the
court
might--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--your
honor,
it
would
take
me
a
moment
to
find
it,
i'm
afraid.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
believe
it
is
there.
i
hate
to
say
i'm
sure
of
anything,
but
i
believe
it
is
there,
sir.
mr.
christopher
crowley
all
right,
sir.
as
i
say,
the
regulations
were
attacked
in
1966
by
senator
ervin
and
others
who
had
been
concerned
about
the
scope
of
the
authorization
in
1964,
and
an
amendment
was
offered
which
would
spell
out
a
detailed
intent
standard.
congressman
rodino
and
congressman
kastenmeier,
who
had
been
strong
proponents
of
title
vi
and
had
been
involved
in
its
passage,
rose
to
its
defense
and
suggested,
in
the
words
of
congressman
rodino,
the
amendment
"presents
new
criteria
and
restricts
the
workings
of
title
vi.
"
"it
would
in
effect
be
a
complete
repealer
of
title
vi.
"
congressman
rodino
said
that
it
was
his
"understanding"
that
the
regulations
were
consistent
with
the
objectives
of
the
title.
representative
kastenmeier
said
that
it
was
his
view
that
the
amendment
would
"gut
title
vi
of
the
'64
law.
"
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
can,
sir.
0....
just
a
second.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
can
quote.
the
regulation
prohibits...
it
prohibits
the
use
of
"criteria
or
methods
of
administration
which
have
the
defect
of
subjecting
persons
to
discrimination.
"
--and
if
you
look
at
appendix
page
132,
i
hope
that
language
is
quoted
there...
"and
also
which
have
the
effect
of
defeating
or
substantially
impairing
the
accomplishment
of
the
objectives
of
the
program
as
with
respect
to
individuals
of
a
particular
race,
color
or
national
origin.
"
mr.
christopher
crowley
well,
it
is
our
view,
of
course,
that
the
appropriate
thing...
that
that
is
a
clear
indication
that
to
look
at
effects
is
an
appropriate
approach
and
that
to
do
what
was
done
here,
to
look
at
the
discriminatory
impact,
the
fact
that
the
whites
and
hispanics
got
in
the
top
deciles
at
a
much
lower
rate--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--i
don't
know
that
it
spells
it
out
definitively,
justice
rehnquist.
it
just...
in
our
view
it
shows
a
disposition
to
look
at
the
results
as
opposed
to
intentions,
and
suggests
that
a
focus
on
an
impact
approach
is
appropriate
at
least
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
here
as
under
title
vii.
after
the
1966
effort
to
amend
the
statute,
congress
on
ten
separate
occasions
passed
funding
statutes
which
contained
clauses
directly
modeled
on
section
601.
those
statutes
were
in
force
pursuant
to
impact
regulations
like
the
one
which
i
just
quoted,
which
is
also
relied
upon
in
lau
v.
nichols
and
in
our
decision
below.
in
six
instances
after
this
court's
decision
in
washington
versus
davis,
congress
reenacted
or
amended
clauses
modeled
on
section
601
where
impact
regulations
were
in
place.
we
would
suggest
that
these
were
not
incidental
ratifications
of
those
regulations.
they
were
conspicuous
regulations.
they
imposed
a
significant
affirmative
obligation
on
the
regulatory
agencies
to
monitor
programs,
to
respond
to
complaints.
they
obliged
recipients
of
federal
funds
to
agree
contractually
to
be
bound
by
the
regulations.
there
were
references
to,
in
the
congress
in
the
passage
of
later
acts,
to
the
regulations.
in
the
passage
of...
in
the
public
works
employment
act
of
1966,
the
statute
itself
says
the
discriminatory
provisions
will
be
enforced
through
agency
provisions
and
rules
similar
to
those
already
established
under
title
vi.
when
senator
bayh
was
talking
about
title
ix,
sex
discrimination,
he
said:
"the
same
procedure
that
was
set
up
and
has
operated
with
great
success
under
the
1964
civil
rights
act
and
the
regulations
thereunder
would
be
equally
applicable
to
discrimination
under
title
ix.
"
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
do
not
know
of
other
evidence
in
the
record,
justice
white.
i
know
of
other
evidence--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--i
would
submit
that
congress
had
to
be
aware
of
the
way
in
which
the
agencies
were
conducting
their
compliance
audits,
which
they
would
report
on
to
the
congress
in
the
normal
course.
mr.
christopher
crowley
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
think
i
was
answering
your
question.
what
i
say
is
that
the
way
the
agencies
have
used
the
impact
regulations,
the
way
they've
gathered
data
to
conduct
compliance
audits,
would
have
to
be
known
to
the
congress.
but
there's
no
detail
about
that
in
the
record.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
am
not
aware
of
any
express
language,
justice
white.
i
was
saying
that,
with
respect
to
title
ix...
excuse
me.
senator
bayh's
comment
suggests,
in
sponsoring
title
ix,
the
regulations
have
worked,
there
has
not
been
a
flood
of
lawsuits,
there
has
not
been
a
lot
of
cutoffs,
because
the
statute
and
these
regulations
have
generally
been
obeyed.
as
justice
stevens
said
in
fullilove,
"title
vi
unequivocally
and
comprehensively
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
in
any
federally
sponsored
program.
"
"in
view
of
the
scarcity
of
litigated
claims,
it's
appropriate
to
assume
that
the
law
has
generally
been
obeyed.
"
given
an
18-year
history
of
use
of
these
regulations,
the
return
back
of
the
1966
intent
amendment,
the
passage
of
new
funding
statutes,
passage
of
title
ix,
section
504,
other
funding
statutes
using
the
very
language
of
section
601,
all
of
which
statutes
were
regularly
enforced
with
impact
regulations,
we
would
suggest
that
there
has
been
as
a
practical
matter
developed
a
comprehensive
federal
legislative
and
regulatory
scheme
using
these
impact
regulations
over
the
years
which
has
worked
well,
and
it
should
only
be
disturbed
if
there's
a
clear
indication
that
was
a
contrary
congressional
intent
back
in
1964.
we
also
think
that
it's
appropriate
to
uphold
these
regulations
on
the
grounds
that
they're
reasonably
related
to
the
purposes
of
title
vi.
the
standard
was
set
out
by
justice
stewart
concurring
in
lau.
he
says:
"the
critical
question
is
whether
the
regulations
and
guidelines
by
hew
go
beyond
the
authority
of
section
601.
"
citing
mourning,
he
states,
"we
held
that
the
validity
of
a
regulation
promulgated
under
a
general
authorization
provision.
"
such
as
section
602
of
title
vi,
"will
be
sustained
so
long
as
it's
reasonably
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
enabling
statute.
"
moreover,
he
went
on,
"in
assessing
the
purposes
of
remedial
legislation,
we
have
found
that
departmental
regulations
and
consistent
administrative
construction
are
entitled
to
great
weight.
"
we
suggest
that
here
these
regulations
are
more
than
reasonably
related;
they
are
essential
to
a
meaningful
enforcement
of
title
vi.
the
federal
agencies
have
to
review
thousands
of
programs,
thousands
of
complaints.
they
have
an
obligation
to
conduct
compliance
audits.
if
they
were
obliged
to
use
an
intent
standard
like
that
spelled
out
in
washington
v.
davis,
it
would
be
very
difficult
indeed,
if
not
impossible.
intent
is
hard
enough
to
unwind
in
the
context
of
a
regular
court
case
with
simple
issues.
it's
harder
still
to
probe
where
you're
trying
to
probe
the
intent
of
a
school
board
or
a
police
department
or
the
civil
service
commission
of
new
york.
justice
stevens
again,
in
rogers
v.
lodge
quotes
an
author
saying,
"racial
attitudes
often
operate
at
the
margin
of
consciousness.
"
it's
hard
enough
for
courts
to
probe
what's
going
on
at
that
level.
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
for
administrative
agencies
conducting
thousands
of
reviews
of
federal
programs,
conducting
compliance
audits,
responding
to
complaints,
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
do
any
kind
of
a
meaningful
job
if
they
had
to
use
an
intent
standard.
it's
more
than
reasonably
related
to
take
an
impact
approach,
at
least
as
a
first
step
to
look
to
see
whether
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made
out
and
then
get
into
the
question
of
whether
there's
justification...
the
kind
of
analysis
that
was
done
in
this
case.
we
also
suggest
that
it's
clear
that
if
congress
had
wanted
in
1964
to
adopt
a
constitutional
standard,
they
knew
how
to
do
so.
the
did
so
expressly
in
title
iv.
if
they
had
wanted
to
use
a
clear
intent
standard,
there
was
language
in
title
vii
dealing
with
seniority
systems
talking
expressly
in
terms
of
intent.
we
think
that
if
there
had
been
a
determination
to
make
that
clear
a
distinction,
they
could
have
done
so
and
did
not.
we
also
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
heavy
burden
on
those
who
say
that
title
vi
and
title
vii
should
be
interpreted
fundamentally
differently.
certainly
after
1972,
when
title
vii
was
made
applicable
to
municipalities,
it
would
be
anomalous,
we
suggest,
to
have
a
fundamentally
different
standard
for
discrimination
in
employment
under
the
two
titles.
you
get
the
very
result
that
we
think
is
so
odd
here,
that
you'd
have
a
finding
under
title
vii
that
the
city
of
new
york
has
discriminated
in
violation
of
title
vii,
but
they
could
still
receive
funding
under
title
vi.
we
think
that,
as
i
say,
there's
a
considerable
burden
on
the
people
who
suggest
that
congress
intended
in
1964
to
have
that
kind
of
a
result.
mr.
christopher
crowley
yes,
your
honor,
if
you
like
i'll
talk
to
that.
mr.
christopher
crowley
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
crowley
indeed,
sir.
the
basic
focus,
of
course,
of
our
opponent's
position
and
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
this
situation
is
controlled
by
the
court's
decision
in
bakke.
we
suggest
basically
that
bakke
was,
first
of
all,
a
terribly
difficult
case;
and
second,
an
utterly...
a
difficult
case,
and
second,
a
very
different
case
from
ours.
and
we
hope
that
the
court
will
be
slow
to
rely
on
broad
language
in
our
situation.
as
justice
brennan
said
at
the
outset
of
his
opinion,
"we
agree
with
mr.
justice
powell
that,
as
applied
to
the
case
before
us,
title
vi
goes
no
further.
"
et
cetera.
bakke
was
not
concerned
with
the
question
of
impact
versus
intent,
as
the
united
states
in
an
amicus
brief
was
careful
to
spell
out.
bakke
was
not
concerned
with
what
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
you
start
out
in
bakke
with
an
admitted
intentional
racial
classification
and
the
whole
focus
was
on
justification
of
that.
bakke
was
not
concerned,
as
we
are
here,
with
the
validity
of
contemporaneous
regulations
adopted
pursuant
to
a
broad
grant
of
congressional
authority.
indeed,
justice
brennan
in
bakke
places
considerable
reliance,
emphasis,
on
the
regulations.
at
one
juncture
he
states,
"these
regulations,
which
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
require
presidential
approval,
are
entitled
to
considerable
deference
in
construing
title
vi.
"
mr.
christopher
crowley
not
entirely,
your
honor.
we
think
that--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--we
agree
that
there
is
clear
indication
that
many
congressmen
were
concerned
with
having
a
constitutional
content
for
title
vi.
whether
it
was
the
exclusive
content,
we
tend
to
think
that
that
was
not
the
case.
we
would
suggest
that
even
if
it
is
true
that
title
vi
was
intended
to
have
constitutional
content,
it
was
by
no
means
clear
in
1964
just
what
that
meant.
there
were
a
lot
of
cases
at
that
juncture...
a
recent
jury
selection
case
where
this
court
placed
great
reliance
on
impact.
there
were
certainly
courts
of
appeals
decisions
where
one
could
conclude
that
impact
was
an
appropriate
way
to
make
out
an
appropriate
constitutional
case.
mr.
christopher
crowley
it's
closer
to
yours,
justice--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
crowley
that
is
correct,
sir.
i'd
like
to
save
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i'd
just
like
to
add
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
where
there
has
been
no
reference
in
the
debates
to
intent,
which
is
our
issue,
where
the
debates
are
necessarily
unclear,
that
whether
you
assume
a
constitutional
standard
or
not,
that
there
should
be
deference
to
a
comprehensive
18-year
history
of
the
use
and
ratification
of
regulations
like
these,
which
were
in
our
view
impliedly
endorsed
by
the
congress
in
'66
and
when
they
used
similar
language
to
section
601
in
later
years;
and
that
that's
the
best
evidence
of
what
the
congress'
attitude
toward
intent
was,
toward
intent
versus
impact
was
in
1964.
mr.
christopher
crowley
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
crowley
no.
mr.
christopher
crowley
there
was
never
a
discussion
of
that
in
that
light,
no,
sir.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
would
have
thought,
justice
white,
that
it
was
covered
by
the
fact
that
we
did
plead
section
1983
in
this
case,
which
as
as
i
read
your
view--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--there
was
no
appeal
on
that
subject.
no
cert
was
granted
on
that
subject,
your
honor.
we
think...
it's
my
understanding
that
because
of
the
pleading
of
section
1983
there
would
be
a
private
cause
of
action.
we
also,
of
course,
think
so
under
the
analysis
in--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--i
think
that
could
be
raised
here,
sir.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
we
would,
of
course,
urge
the
analysis
in
cannon,
that
it's
appropriate
to
find
that
there
was
implied
a
private
right
of
action
in
title
vi
in
addition
to
1983.
mr.
christopher
crowley
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
thought
it
did.
mr.
christopher
crowley
yes,
sir,
i
suppose
they
could
have.
but
we
think
that
in
this
case
they
did
not.
mr.
christopher
crowley
if
the
congress...
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
brennan,
if
the
congress
in
1964
intended
to
limit
what
the
federal
agencies
could
do
to
a
clear
washington
v.
davis
intent
standard,
i
would
not
argue
that
the
regulations--
mr.
christopher
crowley
--no,
sir.
but
we
think
that,
even
adopting
the
notion
that
there
was
intended
to
be
constitutional
content,
it
was
by
no
means
clear
in
1964
that
they
didn't
contemplate
that
there
wouldn't
be
impact
regulations;
that
those
impact
regulations
were
adopted
shortly
thereafter,
with
great
publicity
at
the
time,
and
that
they're
entitled
to
great
deference.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
do
not...
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens,
i
do
not
recall
the
answer
to
your
second
question.
as
to
the
first,
i
would
have
thought
that
section
1983,
which
grants
a
cause
of
action
as
to
the
constitution
and
laws,
would
make
it
clear
that
the
cause
of
action
as
to
section
601...
i
would
think
that
that
would
carry
over
as
to
regulations
as
well,
sir.
mr.
christopher
crowley
yes,
sir.
mr.
christopher
crowley
as
long
as
they
are
valid
and
have
the
force
of
law,
which
we
strongly
urge
that
they
are.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
christopher
crowley
cert
was
not
granted
on
it.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
powell.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i
hope
i'm
not
right
about
this.
i
hope
i'm
not
right
about
that.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
if
there
were
no
private
cause
of
action.
mr.
christopher
crowley
i'm
afraid
i
agree
that
you're
certainly
not
precluded
from
looking
at
that.
mr.
christopher
crowley
thank
you
very
much.
