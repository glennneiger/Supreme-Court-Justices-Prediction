j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
crowley,
may
i
ask--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--below
was
there
any
discussion
of
the
question
whether
there
was
a
private
cause
of
action
derived
from
the
regulations,
as
contrasted
with
from
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
never
a
discussion
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather,
mr.
crowley,
if
we
may
address
the
question
of
a
private
cause
of
action,
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
there
was
no
disparate
impact
liability
under
601
itself,
but
that...
i
gather
you
would
not
think
we
could
reach
the
question
whether
impact
liability
under
the
regulations
here
could
be
reached.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
not
argue
that?
