paul

mr.
crowley,
may
i
just
ask
you,
where
are
the
regulations
in
the
materials
before
us?
do
you
quote
them
anywhere?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
they're
referred
to
a
couple
of
times,
but
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they're
not
in
the
lower
court
opinion,
either?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
the
relevant
language
is
in
the
brief?
i
didn't
even
find
that,
the
specific
language
you
rely
on.
0....
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
sure
it's
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
refer
to
pages
13
and
32
in
your
index,
and
i
didn't
find
it
on
either
of
those
two
pages.
i'll
just
put
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
justice
brennan's
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
title
vi
in
bakke?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
any
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
phrase
the
question
this
way.
justice
brennan
and
i
had
quite
a
different
interpretation
of
the
congressional
intent
in
our
respective
opinions
in
bakke.
which
of
those
two
analyses
of
legislative
intent
and
legislative
history
does
your
position
come
closer
to
adopting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
same
as
my
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
quite
different
than
justice
brennan's.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
on
the
private
case
of
action
problem.
your
suggestion
that
1983
may
be
the
source
of
your
remedy,
does
that
treat
the
regulations
or
the
title
vi
as
the
federal
law
that
is
referred
to
in
1983?
that's
my
first
question.
my
second
question
is,
was
this
at
all
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
basis
for
sustaining
the
cause
of
action?
judge
meskill
found
no
private
claim,
and
did
he
have
a
chance
to
consider
the
1983
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
say
the
word
"laws"
encompasses
regulations
as
well
as
federal
statutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
view.
as
long
as
the
regulation
is
valid
and
has
the
force
of
law.
