william
h.
rehnquist
but
they're
not
contained
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
rely
so
heavily
on
them,
i'm
somewhat
surprised
that
you
didn't
set
them
out
in
your
brief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
paraphrase
the
regulations
that
you're
relying
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it
takes...
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
one
interpret
the
phrase
"which
have
the
effect
of
subjecting
one
to
discrimination?
"
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
how
the
word
"effect"
really
helps
you
there.
if
you
say
that
if
it
has
the
effect
to
subject
one
to
discrimination,
i
don't
see
that
as
defining
how
the
word
"discrimination"
should
be
interpreted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
crowley,
are
you
going
to
address
in
your
argument
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
expressed
one
view
or
another
about
the
intent
required
under
title
vi?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
just
asked
you
a
question,
did
you
plan
to
address
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
this
court
has
had
several
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
was
the
majority
opinion
in
bakke?
[laughter]
