chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
michigan
against
long.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
belton
and
robbins
and
the
cases
that
came
after
this
case
was
decided?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sure
did.
i
am
speaking
of
the
examination
of
the
trunk.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
once
this
car
was
stopped,
he
was
ultimately
arrested,
was
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
strauss
is
going
to
have
the
lectern
next.
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
if
this
gentleman
had
tried
to
walk
away
shortly
after
the
police
got
there
but
before
there
was
anything
said
about
an
arrest,
what
would
have
happened
to
him
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
under
what
we
have
said
many
times,
if
he
can't
walk
away,
he
is
under
arrest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
search
of
the
trunk
came
some
significant
time
after
the
bag
of
marijuana
was
discovered
on
the
front
seat,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
the
crucial
question
whether
they
do,
in
fact,
intend
to
take
him
into
custody
or
whether
they
are
lawfully
authorized
to
do
it,
whether
they
do
or
do
not
take
him
into
custody.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
he
may
be
released
on
sort
of
a
"parole"
to
drive
his
own
car
home
if
he
is
not
drunk
or
if
he
is
not
injured.
but,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
he
has
been
arrested
as
soon
as
his
liberty
has
been
detained
or
interfered
with,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
i
think
that
has
been
done
on
a
number
of
occasions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
if,
as
justice
marshall
has
suggested,
if
the
state
constitution
affords
an
adequate
ground,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case
or
is
the
court
trying
to
share
the
burden
with
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
have
reversed
them
often
enough.
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
they
do
with
the
knife?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
after
they
found
marijuana
in
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
know
what
you
mean
when
they
produced
on
inventory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
they
didn't
write
out
a
description
of
items
when
you
say
they
had
no
inventory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
resume
arguments
at
1:00.
