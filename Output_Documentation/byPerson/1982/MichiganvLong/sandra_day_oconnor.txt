mr.
caruso--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--do
you
think
that
the
officers
could
have
arrested
the
defendant
in
this
case
for
speeding
or
for
driving
while
intoxicated
or
perhaps
even
for
carrying
the
weapon
which
they
found?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
before
all
this
search
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
it
is
your
position
or
you
would
concede
that
that
did
not
occur?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
driving
while
intoxicated?
they
don't
take
somebody
into
custody
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
caruso,
would
you
address
the
question
of
whether
there
is
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
in
this
case?
there
is
some
indication
that
michigan
imposes
a
higher
standard
for
illegal
search
and
seizure
cases
than
the
federal
constitution
would
require.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
cited
the
michigan
constitution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
cases
and
statutes
in
michigan
and
the
michigan
constitution,
in
fact,
require
a
higher
standard
in
this
circumstance
than
would
be
required
by
the
federal
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
if
the
michigan
supreme
court
were
to
apply
michigan
law,
would
it
reach
the
result
you
are
asking
us
to
reach
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
it
would
allow
in
your
opinion
clearly
a
terry
type
search
of
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--auto
interior?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
base
that
on
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
strauss,
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
this
wingspan
approach
to
a
terry
search,
does
the
expanded
search
of
the
interior
of
the
car
of
necessity
involve
a
more
extensive
search
than
would
be
the
case
for
a
pat
down
of
an
individual
where
we
have
said
you
just
pat
them
down
and
see
if
there
are
weapons?
to
search
the
interior
of
the
car,
are
you
talking
about
a
more
detailed
sort
of
a
search,
going
in
the
glove
compartment
and
actually
looking
around,
lifting
up
the
bar
in
the
middle
between
the
seats
and
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
concede
that
it
would
of
necessity
be
more
extensive
than
the
pat
down
that
we
approved
in
terry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
but,
i
assume
under
a
terry
pat
down...
we
have
not
at
least
said,
i
think,
that
you
can
pull
out
a
little
marijuana
baggie
if
that
is
what
it
feels
like.
all
you
can
pull
out
is
a
weapon.
now,
in
a
search
for
the
weapons
in
the
interior
of
a
car,
you
are
arguing
that
you
could
pull
out
the
baggie
of
marijuana.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
not
a
marijuana
cigarette
or
a
little
baggie
or
something
of
that
sort,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
may
be
less
intrusive
in
a
personal
sense,
but
you
may
be
able
to
get
more
objects
and
make
a
more
thorough
search.
would
you
agree
if
you
were
to
extend
the
doctrine?
