justice

mr.
solicitor
general,
you
several
times
say
the
terry
type
search
of
the
automobile.
there
was
no
automobile
in
terry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
keep
saying
terry
type
search
of
an
automobile?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
put
him
up
against
the
side
of
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
put
the
man
up
against
the
side
of
the
car
and
patted
him
down.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
a
terry
search.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
went
further.
you
went
in
the
trunk,
you
went
every
place
in
the
world
except
the
tires.
justice
thurgood
marshall
be
extended.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
after
that
it
was
no
frisk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
handcuffed
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
could
have
hurt
whom
then?
they
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
could
have
done
it
before
they
searched
the
trunk
and
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
search
the
trunk
to
find
whether
there
were
weapons
in
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
difference
in
the
belton
case
as
i
remember
is
there
was
one
officer
and
four
men,
three
men
or
something.
this
is
two
officers
with
one
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i
think
that
two
officers
ought
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
one
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
leave
it
up
to
the
officers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
was
told,
whoa,
and
he
stopped.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
give
us
any
reason
why
they
didn't
say
just
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
we
ask
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
we
ask
them
the
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it
comes
up
every
other
week.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
they
know
the
only
thing
they
have
to
do
is
to
say
this
is
being
decided
on
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
michigan,
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know,
but
couldn't
they
have
said
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
we
persuade
them
to
say
whether
they
do
one
or
the
other?
