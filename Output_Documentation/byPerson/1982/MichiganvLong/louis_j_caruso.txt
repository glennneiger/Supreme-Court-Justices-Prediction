mr.
louis
j.
caruso
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
warrantless
search
of
the
respondent
and
the
auto
passenger
part
of
the
automobile
under
his
control
and
possession
prior
to
his
arrest
for
possession
of
marijuana
and
of
the
automobile
trunk
after
his
arrest.
the
two
deputy
sheriffs
were
driving
south
on
a
country
road
in
a
rural
area
at
midnight
and
the
car
that
the
sheriffs
were
driving
was
passed
by
another
automobile
going
in
the
opposite
direction
and
was
clocked
by
a
radar
device
at
71
miles
an
hour
in
a
55
mile
hour
zone.
the
car
was
pursued
by
the
two
deputy
sheriffs
with
pursuit.
in
about
five
or
ten
minutes
they
lost
sight
of
the
vehicle
for
approximately
five
or
ten
minutes.
they
did
notice
the
tail
lights
go
left
off
of
the
road
that
they
were
on
and
as
they
made
the
turn
left
to
follow
the
car
they
found
the
car
in
the
ditch.
the
front
end
of
the
car
was
in
the
ditch.
the
rear
end
was
sticking
out
over
the
portion
of
the
traveled
road.
the
entire
incident
lasted
about
five
minutes.
there
was
no
other
traffic
that
was
noticed
in
the
area.
the
police
car
approached
the
car
in
the
ditch
on
the
passenger
side
and
they
saw
respondent
seated
in
the
driver's
side
of
the
automobile
behind
the
wheel
and
was
the
only
occupant.
respondent
exited
the
automobile,
leaving
the
driver's
side
door
wide
open
with
the
dome
light
on,
and
met
the
two
police
officers
at
the
rear
of
the
automobile.
at
that
time
one
of
the
deputies
asked
respondent
for
his
driver's
license.
the
deputy
did
not...
the
respondent
did
not
respond.
he
didn't
say
a
word,
he
stared,
and
he
was
asked
a
second
time
by
the
deputy
to
produce
his
driver's
license.
after
a
few
seconds
he
reached
in
his
wallet
on
his
person
and
produced
a
driver's
license.
secondly,
the
deputy
sheriff
asked
respondent
for
the
certificate
of
registration
and
this
is
required
to
be
produced
on
demand
under
the
michigan
vehicle
code.
again,
there
was
no
response
and
a
few
moments
of
staring
and
the
second
time
he
was
asked
for
the
registration.
at
that
time
respondent
made
a
move
toward
the
open
door
on
the
driver's
side
of
the
car.
he...
one
of
the
deputies
was
behind
respondent
and
the
other
deputy
was
at
his
side.
at
the
time
they
approached
the
door,
the
deputy
saw
a
knife,
a
large,
folded
knife
in
plain
view
on
the
floorboard
on
the
driver's
side
next
to
the
door
that
was
open
and
in
front
of
the
front
seat
of
the
car.
upon
seeing
that
knife,
the
deputy
sheriff,
one
of
the
deputies,
said,
hold
it,
and
he
was
then
moved
toward
the
rear
of
the
car
at
the
side
window
and
with
his
hands
on
the
roof
of
the
car
he
was
patted
down
by
one
of
the
deputies.
the
other
deputy
at
that
point
in
time
looked
into
the
car.
he
did
not
enter
it.
he
took
his
flashlight
and
he
flashed
in
the
interior
of
the
car
and
as
he
did
that
he
noticed
the
armrest...
the
front
seat
is
divided
by
an
armrest,
divided
in
half.
he
noticed
something
protruding
from
underneath
the
armrest.
at
that
point
in
time,
he
knelt
in
and
again
examined
it
more
closely
and
he
flipped
up
one
side
of
the
armrest.
as
he
flipped
up
the
one
side
of
the
armrest,
he
noticed
that
this
was
a
pouch
of
a
sort
that
was
open.
he
did
not
touch
it.
he
flashed
a
light
on
the
object
and
on
more
close
examination
he
noticed
that
there
was
a
plastic
baggie
sticking
out
of
the
pouch
and
out
of
the
plastic
baggie
in
full
view,
without
touching
it,
he
noticed
a
substance
that
appeared
to
him
to
be
marijuana.
at
that
point
in
time,
he
picked
up
the
pouch.
he
felt
it
with
his
hands
and
he
felt
another
hard
object
in
that
pouch.
he
opened
it
up
and
he
noticed
that
the
bottle
had
a
powdery
substance
and
there
was
a
pill
of
some
sort
that
was
wrapped
up
in
tinfoil.
at
that
point
in
time,
the
deputy
sheriff
says,
i
am
arresting
you
for
grass,
for
possession
of
marijuana.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
believe
that
at
that
time
a
violation
of
michigan
vehicle
code
for
speeding--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--yes.
he
could
have
been
arrested.
there
could
have
been
a
custodial
arrest
because
violation
of
speed
limit
is
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that
did
not
occur.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
they
do
not
arrest
for
speeding
violations
unless
it
is
something
more
in
addition
to--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--well,
they
would
have
to
go
through
a
process
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
party
is
intoxicated
and
then
go
from
that
point.
but,
at
this
particular
point
in
time,
they
didn't
know
really
what
they
had.
they
noticed
a
car
in
the
ditch.
they
had
an
unresponsive
individual
who
appeared
to
be
under
the
influence
of
something
and
they
wanted
to
determine
whether
the
registration
to
the
vehicle
was
in
the
car
or
on
his
person
as
required
by
the
motor
vehicle
code.
at
the
time
they
patted
him
down,
at
the
time
that
the
saw
the
large
knife,
they
picked
up
and
they
found
the
pouch
and
this
sort
of
thing,
they
charged
him
and
they
arrested
him
and
then
they
asked
for
the
key,
because
of
the
deputies
who
looked
inside
had
noticed
that
the
car
was
in
the
lock
position,
the
driving
mechanism,
and
there
wasn't
any
key
in
the
ignition.
he
did
give
one
key
and
then
he
said
at
that
time,
the
respondent,
that
he
did
not
have
a
key
to
the
trunk.
so,
the
deputy
walked
around
back
of
the
trunk
and
he
noticed
when
he
looked
at
the
lock
of
the
trunk
the
lock
had
been
punched
out,
there
wasn't
any
lock
there.
he
was
able
to
open
up
the
trunk
by
simply
inserting
a
small
penknife
that
triggered
the
mechanism
and
opened
up
the
trunk.
and,
when
he
looked
in
the
truck,
he
found
two
large
sacks
and
they
were
split
open,
it
was
a
large
sack
split
open
into
two
sections
which
appeared
to
him
to
contain
again
marijuana,
later
found
out
to
be
about
70
to
75
pounds
of
contraband
marijuana.
at
that
time
they
patted
him
down
a
second
time,
they
handcuffed
him
and
took
him
back
to
the
cruiser
and
called
in
a
wrecker
to
have
the
car
towed
into
the
sheriff's
department
to
secure
the
vehicle
and
to
bring
the
respondent
to
jail.
now,
it
is
our
position,
the
state's
position
here,
that
the
frisk
of
respondent
and
the
interior
of
the
automobile
under
these
circumstances
is
justified
by
the
rationale
of
terry
v.
ohio.
although
terry
allowed
an
encroachment
on
the
privacy
rights
of
an
individual
for
the
protection
of
police
officers,
the
frisk
in
terry
was
for
weapons
that
was...
and
was
confined
to
the
pat
down
of
the
individual's
outer
clothing.
here,
the
search
for
weapons
was
not
limited
to
the
frisk
of
respondent
but
extended
into
the
passenger
part
of
the
automobile.
and,
as
stated
in
adams
v.
williams,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
terry
search
is
not
to
discover
evidence
of
crime
but
rather
to
allow
a
police
officer
to
conduct
an
investigation
without
fear
of
personal
injury.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
supreme
court
in
its
decision
that
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
reference
to
article
1,
section
11
of
the
michigan
constitution,
but
did
not
discuss
it
at
any
time
in
the
opinion.
the
decision
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
4th
amendment.
so,
i
would
say
in
chief
they
discussed
only
federal
cases
dealing
with
the
4th
amendment.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
they
did
cite
the
michigan--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--in
people
v.
moore,
a
michigan
case,
it
was
held
that
the
particular
clause
in
the
michigan
constitution
which
permits
the
introduction
into
evidence
of
evidence
found
that
is
not
subject
to
the
strict
requirement
of
reasonable
search
and
seizure
is
inconsistent
with
the
4th
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and,
therefore,
it
doesn't
obtain
and
it
doesn't
endure.
so,
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
not
decided
on
the
basis
of
that
clause
in
the
michigan
constitution
which
permits
a
greater
latitude
in
the
search
for
evidence
in
connection
with
narcotics
or
from
an
automobile.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes,
yes,
it
would.
yes,
it
would.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes,
it
would
allow
a
terry
type
search.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes,
it
would.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
base
that
on
the
proposition
that
the
michigan
case
law
with
reference
to
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
really
relates
to
the
4th
amendment
of
the
constitution.
and
repeatedly
these
cases
that
have
permitted
searches
of
this
type
have
relied
upon
the
terry
rationale.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
it,
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
think
it
was
just
simply...
just
added
to
it
as
just
an
afterthought.
they
didn't
discuss
it.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
she
did
find
that
there
is
not
necessarily
any
violation
of
the
michigan
constitution,
but
just
a
statement
in
that
sense
and
then
the
majority
opinion
that
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
really
discuss
the
michigan
constitution.
it
simply
relied
on
all
of
the
cases,
citing
all
the
cases,
analyzing
the
cases
that
dealt
with
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes,
mr.
justice,
it
did.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
there
is
a
clause
added
to
that
that
is
totally
different
than
the
4th
amendment,
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
no,
there
wasn't
and
this
is
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--i
say
to
frisk
or
search
the
automobile
based
upon
the
terry
rationale.
it
is
not
a
terry
type
search
of
an
automobile.
the
terry
type
search
i
have
reference
to
in
using
that
phrase
is
reference
to
a
protective
search
for
the
protection
of
the
police
officers.
i
indicated
in
the
terry
case--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that
is
a
terry
search.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
we
are
asking
that
the
terry
rationale--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--be
extended
to
go
into
the
passenger
compartment
of
an
automobile
because
on
the
totality
of
the
facts
in
this
case
we
feel
that
the
police
officers
were
justified
in
continuing
the
search
into
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
automobile.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
in
those
cases
i
don't
recall
that
that
really
involved
a
protective
search
for
the
benefit
of
police
officers.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
oh,
the
examination
of
the
trunk.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
forgetting
the
interior
of
the
car
and
confining
to
the
search
of
the
trunk
after
arrest,
i
would
say
that
today
it
would
governed
by
probable
cause
search
based
on
ross
and
based
on
michigan
v.
thomas
and
also
based
upon
the
belton
case,
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
in
this
case,
we
relied
on
it,
as
indicated
by
the
question
presented
in
the
brief,
upon
the
rationale
of
opperman.
but,
any
one
of
those
cases
would
apply
to
the
trunk
search
today.
there
isn't
any
question
about
it
in
my
opinion.
but,
here,
confining
my
remarks
for
the
moment
to
the
search
of
the
interior
of
the
car
after
the
knife
was
found,
is
based
upon
the
terry
rationale,
if
you
please.
the
terry
rationale
had
to
do
with
an
investigatory,
a
legitimate
investigatory
search,
and
the
police
officer
in
this
case
had
found
himself
in
a
legitimate,
confrontive,
investigative
search
for
speeding
and
for
a
car
in
the
ditch.
and,
the
petitioner
suggests,
considering
the
totality
of
the
facts,
that
it
was
at
night
time,
in
a
rural
area,
an
unresponsive
individual
who
would
not
respond,
who
made
a
move
toward
the
open
door
of
the
car
and
found...
and
there
was
a
knife
in
plain
view.
i
think
that
all
of
these
factors
gave
rise
to
an
articulable
suspicion
that
would
justify
a
fear
and
a
concern
in
these
two
police
officers.
both
of
these
officers
had
considerable
experience.
one
of
them
had
had
eight
years
service
as
a
deputy
sheriff
and
three
years
in
the
police
department
for
the
city
of
detroit.
the
other
had
had
some
experience
and
training
in
the
justice
department.
and
both
of
these
people
have
testified...
it
is
very
clear
from
the
record
that
they
were
concerned
at
all
times
during
the
course
of
the
so-called,
on-going
investigation.
and,
as
i
submit,
the
patting
down
of
respondent
and
then
taking
that
search
from
respondent
into
the
car
under
these
facts
and
circumstances
is
part
and
parcel
of
a
continuous
investigation
in
one
incident.
in
addition
to
that,
the
reason
the
police
officer
indicated
that
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
car
to
examine
the
interior
of
the
car,
he
had
not
yet
received
the
certificate
of
registration.
he
was
going
to
allow
the
respondent
to
go
into
the
car...
he
testified
to
that...
to
get
that
registration
of
the
automobile
even
after
he
had
found
the
knife
and
secured
the
knife.
he
went
back
in
there
to
see
if
there
were
any
further
weapons
so
that
respondent
could
go
back
into
the
car
to
see
if
he
could
produce
that
certificate
of
registration.
but,
of
course,
at
that
point
in
time,
they
lifted
the
armrest,
they
found
the
marijuana
and
the
arrest
was
made
on
that
basis.
and,
the
area
that
was
searched
was
an
area
that
has
to
do
with
which
there
is
no
great
expectation
of
privacy.
it
is
under
the
armrest.
it
is
an
area
that
could
conceal
a
weapon.
and,
as
i
say,
the
officers
were
bent
on
a
very
limited
intrusion.
they
were
looking...
the
officer
was
looking
only
for
weapons
because
he
intended
to
let
respondent
back
into
the
car.
now,
insofar
as
the
case
law
on
this
is
concerned,
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms
this
court
gave
recognition
to
the
great
danger
that
surrounds
an
investigative
stop
by
a
police
officer
to
the
extent
that
he
is
permitted
to
order
the
driver
out
of
the
car.
and,
if
a
person
orders...
if
a
police
officer
orders
a
driver
out
of
the
car,
it
is
for
safety
purposes
and,
of
course,
if
nothing
is
wrong,
then
he
goes
back
into
the
car.
but,
if
there
are
terry
factors
that
come
into
being
as
in
this
case,
the
finding
of
the
knife
and
under
these
totality
of
circumstances,
then,
of
course,
a
search
of
the
interior
of
the
car
before
letting
him
back
in
is
justified.
it
is
justified
under
the
reasoning
of
pennsylvania
v.
mimms.
it
is
justified
under
the
reasoning
of
the
terry
case.
and,
the
alternative
would
have
been,
as
suggested
by
justice
o'connor,
we
could
have
made...
the
officer
could
have
made
a
custodial
arrest,
but
they
don't
do
these
things
unless
they
absolutely
have
to.
but,
at
this
point
in
time,
when
they
observed
the
person,
they
were
still
in
the
investigative
process
that
was
on-going
to
try
to
determine
just
what
they
had
here,
a
speedster,
an
unresponsive
person,
and
here
you
have
a
car
in
the
ditch.
now,
the
search
after
arrest,
it
can
be
justified
under
opperman,
because
there
certainly
isn't
any
pretext
involved
in
this
case
because
the
inventory
search
was
made
at
the
scene.
it
was
made
at
the
scene
after
the
arrest
had
been
made
and
certainly
it
would
be
justified
in
this
case.
unlike
opperman,
the
car
was
taken
in
because
of
the
multiple
traffic...
parking
tickets
that
the
party
had
had.
in
this
particular
case,
an
arrest
had
been
made
on
the
scene
and
on
the
spot.
and,
in
addition
to
that,
as
i
say,
i
believe
that
the
case
is
also
governed
by
these
more
recent
decisions,
particularly
michigan
v.
thomas.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes,
i
do
believe
that
you
have
jurisdiction
under
this...
in
this
case
simply
because
the
court
did
apply
down
below,
and
the
court
did
apply
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
4th
amendment
and
the
case
law,
the
u.s.
case
law,
pursuant
under
the
4th
amendment
with
reference
thereto;
to
wit,
specifically
the
terry
case.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
even
if
michigan
imposes
a
tougher
standard,
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
under
the
decision...
i
believe
it
is
delaware
v.
prouse.
i
believe
that
we
had
a
similar
circumstance
here
before
the
court
even
though
it
could
have
been
decided
on
the
state
constitution.
it
was
also
decided
on
the
federal
constitution
and
the
court
retained
jurisdiction
of
that
matter.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
don't
believe
it
was
the
case
here,
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
i
think
in
this
case
what
they
did,
they
really
applied
the
4th
amendment.
now,
insofar
as
the
4th
amendment
of
the
u.s.
constitution
and
the
michigan
constitution,
they
are
almost
identical
in
content
except
for
that
final
clause
and
it
says
"the
provision
of
this
section
shall
not
be
construed
to
bar
from
evidence
in
any
criminal
proceedings
any
narcotic
drug,
firearm,
bomb,
explosive,
or
any
other
dangerous
weapon
seized
by
a
peace
officer
outside
the
curtilage
of
any
dwelling
house
in
this
state.
"
and
this
provision,
our
courts
have
said,
matched
against
the
4th
amendment,
has
no
effect.
