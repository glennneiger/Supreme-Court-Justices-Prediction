justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
belton
was
passenger
compartment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
can
be
treated
like
the
passenger--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
belton
applies
where
the
search
is
not
a
custodial
arrest
or
where
the
arrest
is
not
a
custodial
arrest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
search
incident
in
robinson
and
gustoferson
applies
only
to
custodial
arrests,
do
you
think
belton
nonetheless
applies
across
the
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
a
custodial
arrest
is
where
the
police
plan
to
take
the
person
arrested
into
custody
as
opposed
to
simply
give
him
a
ticket.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
if
that
is
true,
as
i
don't
doubt
it
is
if
you
say
it
is,
how
does
that
apply
to
this
particular
case
where
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
simply
mentions
the
state
constitution
in
part
of
a
sentence
and
all
of
its
analysis
is
in
terms
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
the
cases
are
federal
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
feel
that
articulable
suspicion
cases
turn
on
the
subjective
impressions
of
the
particular
officers
involved
rather
than
kind
of
an
objective
standard?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
our
cases
support
you
in
that?
they
refer
to
articulable
suspicion
and
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
some
of
them
don't
focus
on
subjective.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
think
that
is
probably
it.
but,
i
am
not
sure
that
the
cases
support
you
in
requiring
both
an
objective
and
subjective
belief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
knife
on
the
floorboard?
does
that
happen
every
time
you
have
a
traffic
stop
in
michigan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
all
bad
when
you
are
talking
about
a
search
for
weapons?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
the
ground
that
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
went
on,
that
it
really
wasn't
a
search
for
weapons?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
4th
amendment
prohibits
this.
