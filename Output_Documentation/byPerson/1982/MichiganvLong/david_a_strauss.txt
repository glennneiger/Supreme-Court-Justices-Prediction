mr.
david
a.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
new
york
against
belton
presented
circumstances
similar
to
those
involved
here.
suspects
were
stopped
on
the
highway.
they
got
out
of
their
car
and
the
police
officer
subsequently
looked
into
the
interior
of
the
car.
the
court
in
belton
held
that
the
importance
of
protecting
an
officer's
safety
and
the
need
for
clear
understandable
standards
required
a
brightline
rule
that
an
officer
may
conduct
a
search
incident
to
arrest
in
such
circumstances.
the
court
specifically
did
not
inquire
into
the
factors
that
respondent
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
would
apparently
make
decisive
here,
such
factors
as
the
precise
positioning
of
the
officers
and
the
suspects
at
the
scene
or
whether
there
were
alternative
means
available
that
the
officer
might
have
used
to
control
the
suspect.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
it
deals
with
searches
incident
to
arrest,
justice,
white,
and
this
case
only
involves
the
protective
search
for
weapons
incident
to
a
terry
stop.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
officer
testified,
i
believe,
that
he
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
walk
away.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
he
is
not
necessarily
under
arrest.
in
this
case
i
think
we
very
clearly
have
a
stop
as
opposed
to
an
arrest.
the
officer
also
testified
they
did
not
place
him
under
arrest
until
he
had
seen
the
marijuana.
but,
in
many
ways,
a
stop
in
which
a
suspect
is
not
placed
under
arrest
and
in
which
the
officers
are
often
at
the
scene
with
a
suspect
for
an
extended
period
to
question
him
is
an
even
more
volatile
and
dangerous
situation
for
an
officer
than
one
in
which
a
suspect
has
been
fully
subdued
and
arrested.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
the
search
of
the
trunk
followed
the
discovery
of
the
marijuana
and
the
arrest.
and,
the
search
of
the
trunk,
in
our
view,
could
have
been
justified
under
belton
as
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
was
justice
rehnquist,
but
in
this
case
we
have
an
unlocked
trunk.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
at
least
as
accessible
to
the
suspect
as
the
passenger
compartment.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
that
certainly
would
give
probable
cause
to
search
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--if
under
ross
would
give
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
car.
they
could
at
that
point
searched
the
entire
car
as
a
probable
cause
search
as
well
as
a
search
incident
to
arrest
under
belton.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
but,
the
initial
discovery
of
the
marijuana
was
the
result
of
what
one
might
call
a
car
frisk,
a
search
for
weapons
only
in
the
car.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
once
the
found
the
marijuana
that
is
right.
they
placed
him
under
arrest.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
in
fact,
they
did
at
some
point
and--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
is
right.
the
search...
no
one,
as
far
as
i
know,
justice
marshall,
defends
the
trunk
search
as
a
car
frisk,
as
a
search
for
weapons.
that
is
a
search
incident
to
arrest
or
arguably
a
probable
cause
search,
at
least
a
search
incident
to
arrest
under
belton
because
he
was
under
arrest
at
that
point.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
believe
those
are
the
facts
of
belton,
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
is
precisely
the
sort
of
thing,
justice
marshall,
as
the
court
in
belton
refused
to
inquire
into
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
the
sort
of
thing,
that
it
is
very
dangerous
for
a
court
to
try
to
assess
after
the
fact,
to
go
back
and
to
say,
well--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
when
the
officers
were
acting
with
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
danger,
as
no
one
seems
to
deny
that
they
had
here,
and
take
the
step
precisely
analogous
to
what
the
court
said
they
could
take
in
belton
in
a
situation
that
is,
as
i
said,
even
more
dangerous
than
the
belton
situation
because
the
suspect
is
not
arrested,
he
is
not
in
handcuffs,
he
is
not
held
at
gun
point
or
locked
into
the
back
of
the
car.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
was
told
to
stop
and
his
hands
were
placed
on
the
roof
of
the
car.
but,
the
fact
remains
that
the
officers
had
reason
to
believe
something
that
wasn't
present
in
belton.
here
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
a
dangerous
weapon
in
the
car
that
could
have
been
obtained
by
the
suspect
and
used
against
the
officers.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
is
an
analogous
search,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
would
be
a
search
for
weapons
and
it
couldn't
reach
places
where
a
weapon
could
not
be
concealed
or
from
which
it
could
not
be
obtained.
for
example,
they
couldn't
do
what
the
officers
did
in
carroll
and
rip
open
the
seats.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
in
the
course
of
the
pat
down
an
officer
were
to
find
an
unidentifiable,
unidentifiable
by
touch,
hard
object
beneath
the
outer
clothing
of
the
suspect,
yes,
he
certainly
could
reach
in
and
pull
it
out
and
take
a
look
at
it
which
is
all
that--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--if
it
were
something
that
didn't
feel
like
a
weapon
from
the
outside,
that
is
right.
and,
that
would
be
the
same
principle
that
would
limit
on
this
sort
of
search.
in
fact...
in
sort
of
a
limited
search,
a
weapon
search.
in
fact,
it
seems
fairly
clear
that
an
inspection
for
weapons
on
the
inside
of
a
car
whereas
the
court
has
held
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
less
and
many
parts
of
which
are
visible
from
the
outside
by
any
passerby
is
a
good
deal
less
intrusive
than
having
an
officer
actually
lay
his
hands
on
the
suspect's
body
as
the
court
described
in
terry.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
the
principle,
the
leading
principle
is
exactly
the
same,
justice
o'connor.
you
can
look
for
obtainable
weapons
and
nothing
more,
but,
of
course,
nothing
less
if
the
officer's
safety
is
to
be
protected.
i
think
the
other
difficulty
with
the
approach
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
of
respondent,
in
addition
to
increasing
the
uncertainty
and
danger
faced
by
law
enforcement
officers,
is
that
it
would
have
the
effect
of
imposing
much
greater
burdens
on
suspects
and
of
impairing
values
related
to
the
4th
amendment.
that
is
because
if
an
officer
concerned
about
his
safety
is
unsure
of
his
authority
to
conduct
this
sort
of
car
frisk,
a
limited
search
for
weapons,
he
will
be
forced
to
take
other
highly
intrusive
actions
such
as
handcuffing
a
suspect
or
locking
him
in
the
police
car
through
the
duration
of
the
stop
or
possibly
even
holding
him
at
gunpoint
during
the
stop.
and,
surely,
most
suspects
will
consider
these
to
be
far
more
humiliating
and
unsettling
actions
than
a
limited
weapons
inspection
of
a
car.
but,
if
respondent
prevails,
a
prudent
officer
concerned
about
both
his
own
safety
and
the
dictates
of
the
4th
amendment,
will
have
no
alternative
to
taking
these
actions.
similarly,
and
justice
o'connor
alluded
to
this
point
earlier,
an
officer
with
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
suspect
often
will
merely
stop
him
and
ask
him
questions
to
see
if
there
is
some
exculpatory
explanation,
but
if
the
consequence...
and
that
way
he
can
avoid
an
unnecessary
arrest,
but
if
the
consequence
of
stopping
a
suspect
instead
of
arresting
him,
is
that
there
is
some
question
about
the
officer's
ability
to
protect
his
own
safety,
then,
of
course,
the
officer
simply
will
not
hesitate
to
make
an
arrest
and
conduct
a
complete
search,
an
undoubtedly
more
intrusive
search,
incident
to
arrest
that
belton
gives
him
the
right
to
conduct.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
am
not
sure
there
is--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
difference
between
custodial
arrests
and
other
sorts
of
arrests.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
they
don't
plan
to
take
him
and
remove
him
from
the
scene
subsequent
to
the
arrest,
i
think
there
is
some
question
from
the
face
of
the
belton
opinion
whether
belton
applies
to
such.
here,
of
course,
we
have
a
stop
on
the
scene
and
where
the
suspect
and
the
officers
are
in
continuous
contact
on
the
scene
and
the
officers'
exposure
to
danger
and
exposure
to
hidden
weapons
is
to
that
extent.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
for
purposes
of
what
happened
in
this
case,
even
if
there
were
certainly
no
probable
cause
and
no
grounds
to
take
him
into
custody
and
only
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
him,
they
would
be
authorized
in
taking
these
limited
measures
necessary
to
protect
their
safety.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
is
why
i
asked
justice
rehnquist
the
question.
i
don't
know
of
any
constitutional
limitation
in
this
court's
opinions.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
is
a
matter
of
definition,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
certainly
it
would
be
an
odd
result
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
it
would
be
an
odd
result
to
say
that
if
they
want
to
conduct
a
search
incident
to
arrest
they
must
also
take
him
into
custody
even
in
circumstances
where
they
would
otherwise
be
inclined
perhaps
to
take
bail
from
him
on
the
spot
if
that
is
a
permissible
procedure
in
the
state.
thank
you.
