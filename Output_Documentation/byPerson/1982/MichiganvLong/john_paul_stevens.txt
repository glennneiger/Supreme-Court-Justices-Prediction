justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
are
familiar
with
the
case
of
people
against
secrest,
a
1982
michigan
case
which
relied
only
on
the
michigan
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
an
explanation
of
why
in
this
court,
in
this
particular
case,
the
michigan
court
specifically
said
it
relied
on
the
michigan
constitution
if
it
didn't
mean
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
didn't
justice
coleman
in
her
dissent
also
say
there
was
no
violation
of
michigan
constitution
in
her
view?
she
thought
it
necessary
to
address
the
michigan
constitution
as
well
as
the
majority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
of
course,
it
did
squarely
say
we
find
the
violation
of
the
michigan
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
is
it
not
true
that
the
text
of
the
michigan
constitution
provision
is
rather
different
from
the
text
of
the
4th
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
solicitor
general,
one
other
question
about
our
jurisdiction?
the
case
of
the
people
against
secrest
that
i
asked
you
about
earlier
says
in
words
that
the
state
constitution
imposes
a
higher
standard
of
protection
than
does
the
federal
constitution
and
that
the
federal
cases
are
merely
instructive
in
analyzing.
if
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
michigan
law,
do
you
think
we
have
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
is
true
even
if
michigan
imposes
a
tougher
standard
than
the
federal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
custody
is
always
taken
when
you
arrest
a
person?
how
can
you
arrest
somebody
and
not
take
him
into
custody?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
an
arrest
by
hypothesis
he
is
in
custody,
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
those
reversals
just
confirm
your
view
that
michigan
takes
a
broader
view
of
the
protections
provided
by
the
4th
amendment
and
its
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
you
may
be
repeating,
but
you
said
that
as
a
matter
of
michigan
law
the
search
of
the
trunk
would
have
been
improper
under
the
hilber
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
because
the
presence
of
marijuana
in
the
car
does
not
establish
probable
cause
to
believe
there
is
marijuana
in
the
trunk
or
assuming
there
is
probable
cause
you
still
can't
open
the
trunk?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
is
that
a
michigan
case
based
on
michigan
law
or
on
federal
law,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
