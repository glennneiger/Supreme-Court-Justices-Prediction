mr.
james
h.
geary
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
a
state's
rights
case
as
well
as
a
search
and
seizure
case
and
i
think
that
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
mr.
caruso
about
the
independent
state
ground
for
the
decision
were
appropriate.
this
court
faced
the
same
issue
in
city
of
mesquite
v.
aladdin's
castle,
a
case
in
which
seven
justices
agreed.
in
that
case
it
was
argued
that
the
texas
constitution
provided
an
independent
ground
for
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
and
this
court
determined
that
because
that
possible
ground
for
the
judgment
existed
this
court
lacked
the
jurisdiction
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
lower
court
had
made
an
error
in
interpreting
federal
constitutional
law.
justice
stevens
has
asked
about
the
case
of
michigan
v.
secrest
which
is
reported
in
volume
413
of
the
michigan
reports,
the
same
volume
that
this
case
was
reported
in.
it
is
current
michigan
law
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
plainly
and
unmistakably
said
that
the
michigan
constitution,
article
1,
section
11,
provides
a
higher
standard
than
the
standard
provided
by
the
state
constitution.
michigan
has
had
a
long
history
of
providing
greater
protection
to
citizens
under
the
state
constitution
than
under
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
james
h.
geary
they
only
mention
the
federal
constitution
in
part
of
a
sentence.
they
mention
the
state
constitution
three
times.
mr.
james
h.
geary
the
case
was
terry
v.
ohio.
they
talk
about
canal
zone
v.
bender
and
they
also
mentioned
people
v.
reed
which
is
a
michigan
case.
they
cited
that
in
a
footnote,
and
people
v.
reed,
based
on
the
michigan
constitution
as
well
as
the
federal
constitution.
but,
the
point
i
was
making
about
people
v.
secrest
is
in
that
case
the
court
says
that
they
use
federal
cases
like
terry
v.
ohio
as
a
guide
but
they
don't
feel
bound
by
federal
cases
in
ruling
on
questions
of
michigan
constitutional
law.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
don't
think
they
felt
it
was
necessary.
i
think
they
meant
what
they
said
when
they--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
h.
geary
no,
this
court
has
never
asked
the
michigan
supreme
court--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--that
is
true.
i
think
in
california
v.
krivda,
i
think--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--they
didn't
say
that.
they
said
it
was
being--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--yes,
they
could
have.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
believe
it
would
have
been.
mr.
james
h.
geary
tell
them.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
wish
they
had
decided
it
solely
on
michigan
constitutional
grounds,
but
evidently
the
court
felt
that
the
search
was
barred...
as
i
feel
the
search
was
barred
under
both
the
federal
and
state
grounds.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
can't
read
the
minds
of
the
justices
of
the
michigan
supreme
court,
of
course.
they
have
given
no
indication
that
they
intend
to
share
any
burden.
they
have
said
quite
explicitly
in
a
great
number
of
cases
that
they
regard
the
michigan
constitution
as--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--there
have
been
many
cases
where
you
haven't
reversed
them.
there
are
many
cases
where
certiorari
has
been
denied,
where
they
have
decided
cases
on
both
state
and
federal
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
believe
that
it
does.
and,
i
have
mentioned
in
my
brief
a
few
of
the
many
instances
where
michigan
does
take
a
broader
view
of
citizens'
rights
under
the
state
constitution
than
exist
under
the
federal
constitution.
getting
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
so-called
protective
search
of
the
car
violated
the
federal
constitution,
i
think
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
recently
shown
that
it
recognizes
the
difference
between
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
dissent
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
and
this
sort
of
a
case
where
there
was
no
articulable
facts
to
which
the
officers
could
point
to
demonstrate
danger.
chief
justice
coleman,
in
her
dissent,
listed
a
great
many
decisions
from
other
jurisdictions
and
where
searches
of
automobiles
were
upheld.
i
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
those
cases
were
distinguishable
on
the
facts.
two
days
before
christmas
the
michigan
supreme
court
decided
people
v.
esters
and
upheld
a
warrantless
search
of
an
automobile
and
facts
very
similar
to
many
of
the
cases
cited
by
justice
coleman
in
her
dissent.
in
people
v.
esters,
a
dry-cleaning
establishment
was
held
up
and
a
young
boy
who
saw
the
crime
take
place
wrote
down
the
license
number
of
the
car
that
was
involved
and
gave
a
description
of
the
car
and
a
description
of
the
robber.
within
minutes
the
police
had
located
the
car,
found
it
in
a
driveway,
the
license
matched
the
description
that
was
given.
there
were
wet
tire
tracks
coming
from
the
road
into
the
driveway
and
there
were
wet
footprints
from
the
car
into
the
house.
they
went
into
the
house,
arrested
the
defendant,
who
matched
the
description
given
by
the
witness,
went
out
into
the
driveway
and
searched
the
car
and
found
a
pistol
that
matched
the
description
of
the
pistol
that
was
used
in
the
robbery.
and,
of
the
six
justices
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
who
decided
that
case,
five
wrote
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
search
was
lawful
and
five
said
that
it
was.
and,
i
think
that
people
v.
esters
is
like
minnesota
v.
gilchrist
and
uptegraft
v.
alaska
and
u.s.
v.
powless
and
all
the
other
cases
cited
by
justice
coleman
in
her
dissent,
cases
where
the
police
officers
had
some
specific
reason
to
believe
that
the
defendant
was
dangerous
as
in
uptegraft
v.
alaska.
it
was
almost
identical
on
its
facts
to
people
v.
esters.
in
powless,
the
police
had
received
radio
information
describing
a
van
that
was
alleged
to
have
been
occupied
by
armed
men
and
one
of
them
had
an
outstanding
arrest
warrant
on
him.
he
was
headed
toward
an
indian
reservation
where
there
had
been
some
shootings
within
a
few
days.
some
of
the
other
cases
i
have
mentioned
in
the
brief
are
quite
similar,
massachusetts
v.
almeida.
they
are
all
cases
in
which
the
police
had
some
reason
to
believe
that
a
violent
crime
either
had
been
just
committed
or
was
about
to
be
committed.
and,
you
contrast
that
case
with
this
one,
where
the
police
officers
never
testified
that
they
regarded
mr.
long
as
dangerous.
you
won't
find
the
word
"dangerous"
in
any
of
the
transcripts.
they
never
said
they
feared
for
their
safety.
the
most
that
either
of
the
deputies
was
willing
to
say
is
they
were
not
unconcerned
about
mr.
long.
well,
one
deputy
said,
"i
didn't
completely
ignore
him".
that
was
the
extent
of
his
concern
about
mr.
long.
mr.
long
was
cooperative.
he
did
everything
the
officers
asked.
he
headed
for
the
car
because
they
asked
him
to
go
to
the
car
and
get
the
registration.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
think
it
is
a
difficult
mix
of
objective
standards
and
subjective
factors.
i
think
if
the
officer
does
not
have
the
subjective
believe
that
he
should
be
in
fear
for
his
own
safety,
even
if
some
person
might
on
the
basis
of
the
same
facts,
say
there
was
an
objective
basis
for
searching.
i
don't
think
that
he
could.
mr.
james
h.
geary
terry
discusses
the
officer's
well-founded
belief
of
fear
for
his
own
safety
and
that
is
why
i
say
i
think
it
is
a
difficult
mix.
i
think
as
a
minimum...
i
think
if
the
officer
held
an
unreasonable
belief
that
his
own
safety
was
in
danger
the
search
wouldn't
be
justifiable.
mr.
james
h.
geary
even
if
that
is
a
given,
i
think
that
the
objective
facts
that
were
here...
there
was
very
little
that
distinguished
this
case
from
most
traffic
stops
in
michigan.
mr.
james
h.
geary
no.
the
knife
was
not
contraband.
there
was
no...
it
was
a
legal
knife
and
as
i
mentioned
in
my
brief
there
are
a
great
many
lawful
articles
that
are
commonly
possessed
in
cars
in
michigan
and
elsewhere
that
would
present
at
least
as
much
harm
to
the
deputies
as
this
knife
did.
the
deputies
ignored
the
screwdriver
that
was
in
the
car
in
their
search
for
weapons.
the
ignored
a
hammer.
there
is
a
michigan
case
where
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
where
a
traffic
detainee
returned
to
his
car
and
used
the
car
to
assault
the
officer.
and,
literally,
if
there
is
a
traffic
stop
and
the
justification
for
the
so-called
search,
protective
frisk
of
the
car
is
that
the
detainee
might
return
to
the
car
and
use
something
in
it
or
the
car
itself
to
injure
the
officer,
then
as
a
practical
matter
you
are
saying
that
any
detainee,
traffic
detainee
that
is
stopped
is
going
to
have
his
car
searched.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
personally
don't
believe
this
was
a
search
for
weapons
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
the
officers
never
treated
the
defendant
as
a
dangerous
person
and
ignored
very
obvious
tools
that
could
have
been
used
to
hurt
themselves
and
instead
concentrated
on
a
billfold.
mr.
james
h.
geary
no,
they
did
not
say
that.
they
assumed
that
it
was
a
protective
search.
and,
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
bad.
i
think
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
in
mind
the
dangers
of
police
work
when
they
drafted
the
4th
amendment.
they
had
long
experience
with
smugglers,
with
the
efforts
of
british
revenue
officers
to
enforce
tax
laws
with
writs
of
assistance,
and
they
knew
that
people
sometimes
violently
resisted
the
efforts
of
police
to
enforce
the
law
and
they
still
passed
the
4th
amendment.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--exactly
so.
i
think
that
this
case
is
much
more
like
sibron
v.
new
york
than
it
is
like
terry
v.
ohio.
in
sibron,
you
will
recall
the
court
said
that
a
police
officer
couldn't
just
start
searching
for
evidence.
they
had
to
have
some
indication
that
at
least...
that
he
was
actually
searching
for
weapons.
as
i
just
mentioned
in
this
case,
the
officers
gave
every
indication
that
they
weren't
searching
for
weapons.
they
ignored
the
most
obvious
things
in
the
car
that
were
in
plain
view
that
could
have
been
used
as
weapons,
the
screwdriver
and
the
hammer,
and
instead,
concentrated
on
a
small
leather
object
that
was
small
enough
to
be
placed
in
the
deputy's
back
pocket
which
is
where
he
put
it
after
he
picked
it
up.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
wish
i
knew.
we
can't
find
the
knife.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
it
still
belongs
to
mr.
long.
the
deputy...
the
one
deputy
who
went
to
the
car
first
picked
it
up
and
actually
held
it
in
his
hand
while
the
other
deputy
frisked
mr.
long
and
then
i
believe
one
of
the
deputies
put
the
knife
in
his
pocket.
it
was
not
returned
to
mr.
long
and
it
was
not
put
in
the
car.
it
was
used
in
evidence
at
the
trial,
but
i
don't
know
where
the
knife
is
now.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.
long
was
cooperative
at
all
times.
he
did
everything
the
officers
asked.
they
described
him
as
cooperative.
he
was
not
belligerent.
mr.
james
h.
geary
not
very
clearly.
he
was
still
not
at
the
doorway.
mr.
james
h.
geary
he
didn't
say
anything.
he
started
towards
the
doorway.
mr.
james
h.
geary
my
recollection
of
their
testimony
is
that
they
made
no
assumption
as
to
what
he
was
doing,
just
described
his
acts
rather
than...
they
didn't
say
what
they
thought
he
was
about
to
do.
mr.
james
h.
geary
well,
i
can't
complain...
they
had
just
asked
him
for
the
registration
statement
and
that
is
the
only
logical
explanation,
but
i
can't
recall
anything
in
the
record
where
the
deputies
specifically
testified
that
they
thought
that
was
what
mr.
long
was
doing.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
never
did
get
the
registration
papers
for
this
particular
car.
they
found
the
paper
that
showed
the
car
was
titled
in
someone
else's
name,
two
different
documents.
they
never
did
get
the
registration
paper.
i
might
point
out
that
under
michigan
law,
even
if
he
refused...
if
he
said,
no,
i
won't
produce
the
registration
paper,
they
wouldn't
have
been
entitled
to
make
a
custodial
arrest,
people
v.
marshall,
people
v.
7th
district
judge.
you
are
required
to
carry
it,
but
they
can't...
they
can
give
him
an
appearance
ticket
for
not
having
his
registration,
they
can't
take
him
into
custody.
and,
contrary
to
what
mr.
caruso
said,
even
at
the
time
of
this
traffic
offense,
they
could
not
have
made
a
custodial
arrest
for
speeding
under
the
michigan
motor
vehicle
act.
the
citation
is
in
the
brief.
it
is
mcla
257.
--i
think
it
is
727.
they
are
required
to
give
an
appearance
ticket
unless
there
are
some
facts
that
weren't
present
here.
mr.
james
h.
geary
a
traffic
stop.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
think
it
would
be
pretty
clear
that
he
is
not
arrested
as
michigan
courts
use
that
word.
if
they
had
arrested
him,
he
would
have
to
comply
with
the
michigan
interim
bail
act
which
would
have
given
him
an
opportunity
to
post
bond
before
they
could
have
given
him
the
intensive
sort
of
search
that
they
would
have
done
before
the
admitted
him
to
the
jail.
i
think
there
are
lots
of
state
law
reasons
why
they
could
not
have
taken
mr.
long
into
custody.
mr.
james
h.
geary
or
his
car.
i
think
there
was
even
less
justification
for
taking
his
car
and
impounding
it.
they
didn't
have
to
impound
his
car.
they
wanted
to
impound
his
car
and
i
think--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--i
think
that
is
correct.
they
could
have
taken
the
marijuana
and
left
the
car.
under...
it
is
important
to
remember
that
they
never
tried
to
justify
the
search
of
the
trunk
as
either
a
search
incident
to
arrest
or
as
a
probable
cause
search.
if
they
tried--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--they
would
have
lost
as
a
matter
of
state
law
had
they
made
that--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--we
would
lose
under
u.
s.
v.
ross
and
new
york
v.
belton.
mr.
james
h.
geary
and
i
think
we
would
win
under
people
v.
hilber
which
is
michigan
law
which
was
exactly
that
case.
they
found
marijuana
in
the
passenger
compartment,
wanted
to
search
the
trunk
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
said
you
could
not
do
that.
that
case
is
also
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
h.
geary
without
a
warrant.
yes,
they
could
have
gone
out
and
got
a
warrant.
mr.
james
h.
geary
there
are
some
michigan
court
of
appeals
cases,
including
some
recent
ones,
that
say
that
they
follow
carroll.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
can't
recall
the
people
v.
hilber
case
well
enough
to
know
if
they
even
discussed
it
at
all.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
don't
believe
that
michigan
does.
i
just
can't
recall
the
opinion
in
hilber
well
enough
to
say
whether
it
does
or
does
not.
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly
is
the
so-called
inventory
search.
i
am
not
so
sure
how
much
of
an
issue
it
is
before
this
court,
but
my
understanding
is
there
are
two
requirements
for
an
inventory
search.
one,
there
has
to
be
a
search;
and,
secondly,
there
has
to
be
an
inventory.
if
you
don't
have
both
ingredients,
you
don't
have
an
inventory
search.
this
search
produced
no
inventory.
when
the
deputies
testified--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--there
was
no
list
of
the
things
that
was
found
in
the
car.
when
the
deputy
testified
at
the
trial,
he
couldn't
describe
accurately
what
was
in
the
car.
he
had
a
dim
recollection
of
it.
if
the
excuse
was
that
they
wanted
to
protect
themselves
against
crimes
of
theft
or
intrusion
by
vandals
or
that
sort
of
stuff,
it
was--
mr.
james
h.
geary
--yes.
they
didn't
write
out
a
description.
the
search
stopped
when
they
found
the
marijuana
in
the
trunk.
the
deputy
testified
that
he
had
an
investigatory
motive
and
most
importantly
he
testified
that
the
barry
county
sheriff's
department
did
not
do
an
inventory
search
when
he
testified
at
the
preliminary
examination.
there
was
no
standard
procedure
in
their
department
for
inventory
searches.
it
was
plainly
a
ruse
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
didn't
reach
that
question
because
they
didn't
feel
they
had
to.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
believe
that
it
would
have,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
think
that...
my
recollection
of
hilber
is
the
former,
proving
there
is
marijuana
in
the
passenger
compartment
is
not
probably
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
marijuana
in
the
trunk.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
wish
i
had
read
it
just
before
i
came
today.
i
just
really
can't
recall.
mr.
james
h.
geary
i
have
nothing
further
unless
there
are
further
questions.
