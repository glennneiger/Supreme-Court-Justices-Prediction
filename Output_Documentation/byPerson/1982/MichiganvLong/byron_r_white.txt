justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
suppose
the
court
had
started
out
and
said
we
are
going...
we
are
interested
in
deciding
whether
there
was
an
illegal
search
under
the
michigan
constitution
and
then
said
it
might
help
us
to
decided
that
by
talking
about
the
federal
law
and
they
went
through
exactly
the
same
discussion
of
the
federal
law
and
then
said,
as
they
said,
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
search
violated
the
4th
amendment
and
the
michigan
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
suppose
it
is
clear
that
the
state,
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
doesn't
necessarily
follow...
in
applying
its
own
constitution
doesn't
necessary
follow
or
feel
compelled
by
the
federal
rulings,
have
their
own
view
of
their
own
constitution?
that
wasn't
the
case
in
delaware.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
belton...
that
belton
rule
doesn't
accrue
until
there
has
been
an
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
--assume
they
discovered
the
marijuana
in
the
passenger
compartment
and
they
arrest.
wouldn't
that
give
probable
cause
to
search
the
entire
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
under...
not
necessarily
under
belton.
ross.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
record
show
where
he
was
going
when
he
turned
around
and
walked
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
had
asked
him
for
his
registration
statement
which
he
didn't
have.
it
is
clear
enough
that
he
was
headed
back
to
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
the
officers
say
that
they
anticipated
that
he
was
going
to
go
back
into
the
car
to
hunt
for
the
registration
statement
to
see
if
he
had
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understood
from
your
colleague
that
the
testimony
of
the
officer
was
that
they
thought
he
was
going
back
to
the
car
to
find
the
registration
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
sometimes
people
keep
them
in
the
glove
compartment.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
they
call
it
in
michigan
when
you
stop
a
fellow
for
speeding
and
insist
that
he
stay
there
until
he
gets
a
ticket?
that
is
just
a
detention.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
traffic
stop,
a
detention
for
the
purpose
of
giving
a
ticket.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
his
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
didn't,
but
let's
assume
we
disagree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
we
disagree
with
you
and
that
the...
looking
under
the
armrest
was
defensible
and
was
not
unreasonable
and
that
finding
the
initial
bag
of
marijuana
was
defensible
and
suppose
he
had
been
arrested
right
then,
could
they
have
searched
the
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
lose
under
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
michigan
follow
carroll
at
all
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
a
car?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
make
that
arrest
we
have
just
described
and
then
say
that
you
can't
search
the
trunk
of
the
car
you
must
not
follow
carroll.
