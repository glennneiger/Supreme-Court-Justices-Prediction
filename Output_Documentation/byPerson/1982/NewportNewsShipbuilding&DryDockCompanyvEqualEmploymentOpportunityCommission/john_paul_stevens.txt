mr.
kramer,
may
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
view
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
pregnancy
disability
act,
to
what
extent
is
it
proper...
and
i'm
not
sure
one
way
or
another
on
this...
but
to
what
extent
do
you
think
it's
proper
to
rely
on
the
gilbert
case
as
authority,
because
they
expressly
said
they
thought
gilbert
had
misread
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
conflict
between
justice
brennan's
opinion
and
justice
rehnquist's
in
gilbert,
which
should
we
follow
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well...
well,
i
understand...
i
understand...
i
understand
the
argument,
but
it
presents
a
very
interesting
problem
of
statutory
interpretation
where
you
have
congress...
we
have
a
decided
case
interpreting
title
vii,
and
congress
said
they
disagreed
with
it.
and
i
don't
know...
i
mean
i...
i...
it's
just
a
very
difficult--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
unusual
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
was
the...
if
that
was...
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you.
if
that
was
the...
if
that
was
their
purpose,
don't
you
think
they
could
have
said
that
a
little
more
plainly,
if
they
thought
that
the
new
statute
was
taking
care
of
the
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
rather
than
existing
today
when
we're
speaking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kramer,
this
argument
puzzles
me.
if
this
is
discrimination,
it's
clearly
intentional.
the
question
is
whether
it's
discrimination
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
know...
you
know
what...
your
client
knows
what
it's
doing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
statute
wouldn't
have
prohibited
you
from...
from
changing
both
sides
of
the
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
know
exactly
what
you
did.
either
it's
legal
or
it
isn't.
i
don't...
i
just
don't
understand
either
side's
concern
about
the
intentional
point.
