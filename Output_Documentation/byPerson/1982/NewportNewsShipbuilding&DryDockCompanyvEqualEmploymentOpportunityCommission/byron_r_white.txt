take
it

argument
is
that...
that
the...
discrimination
has
to
be
against
an
employee
on
account
of
his
or
her
sex.

not
on
the
sex
of
somebody
who...
for
whom
he
or
she
is
responsible.

but
even
if
this
isn't
discrimination
against
the
employee
based
on
his
or
her
sex,
based
on
his
sex,
it
is
a
discrimination
based
on
sex.
