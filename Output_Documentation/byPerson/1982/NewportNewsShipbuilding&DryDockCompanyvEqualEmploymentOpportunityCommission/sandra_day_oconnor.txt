mr.
kramer--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
your
argument
you're
asking
us
to...
to
look
back
at
the
provisions
of
title
vii,
basically,
to
see
the
answer
to
this
inquiry.
and
let
me
ask
you
whether
you
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
title
vii
for
an
employer
to
furnish
medical
coverage
for
wives
of
employees
but
not
for
husbands.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
title
vii
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
that's
so,
then
how
does
this
case
differ?
i
mean
you
can
forget
the
pregnancy
problem
and
just
tell
me
how
this
differs
from
that
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
even
without
the
pregnancy
disability
act
you
take
the
position
that
it's
covered
under
title
vii?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
the
language
in
the
senate
report
that
says
it's
intended
to
treat
pregnancy,
discrimination
on
account
of
pregnancy
like
any
other
discrimination
on
account
of
sex
goes
against
you.
