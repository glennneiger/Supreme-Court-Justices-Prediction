mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
today
is
revisiting
an
area
that
it
has
visited
in
such
cases
as
geduldig
v.
aiello,
general
electric
company
v.
gilbert,
nashville
gas
company
v.
satty,
and
to
a
somewhat
lesser
degree,
the
decision
of
los
angeles
department
of
water
and
power
v.
manhart.
unlike
those
cases,
however,
the
claim
of
discrimination
here
is
not
being
brought
on
behalf
of
female
employees.
this
case
involves
male
employees
and
the
question
of
what
benefits
are
to
be
provided
their
spouses
for
hospitalization
costs
incurred
as
a
result
of
childbirth.
in
deciding
this
question
the
court
for
the
first
time
is
asked
to
analyze
the
scope
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
of
1978,
an
act
passed
as
a
direct
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
gilbert.
the
shipyard
in
this
case
has
a
comprehensive
group
health
insurance
plan.
the
plan
covers
employees,
their
spouses,
and
unmarried
children
up
to
the
age
of
19
years.
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
pda,
the
shipyard
covered
female
employees
and
the
spouses
of
male
employees
identically
with
respect
to
pregnancy
hospitalization
costs.
under
that
plan,
the
shipyard
provided
hospitalization
costs
incurred
as
a
result
of
normal
childbirth
of
up
to
$500
with
full
prenatal
expenses
taken
care
of,
physician
and
anesthesiologist
costs,
and
major
medical
coverage
in
the
event
of
pregnancy
complications.
as
a
result
of
the
pda,
however,
the
shipyard
removed
the
$500
cap
with
respect
to
its
female
employees,
but
retained
the
cap
with
respect
to
the
spouses
of
its
male
employees.
it
is
the
failure
to
remove
this
cap
which
the
government
alleges
constitutes
intentional
compensation
discrimination
against
male
employees
under
section
703(a)
of
title
vii.
at
the
outset
it's
important
to
note
that
the
government's
position
here
has
not
been
a
model
of
consistency,
indeed
has
been
ever-changing.
when
congress
considered
the
pda,
drew
days,
then
assistant
attorney
general
for
civil
rights,
and
the
deputy
general
counsel
of
the
eeoc
testified
in
house
hearings,
pursuant
to
a
question,
that
they
did
not
believe
that
the
pda
was
intended
to
govern
the
question
of
dependents
or
their
coverage.
the
eeoc,
when
it
promulgated
its
very
question
and
answers
dealing
with
the
issue
of
dependent
coverage
for
male
employees,
stated
that
the
issue
was
not
resolved
by
the
pda,
but
rather
had
to
be
resolved
under
existing
title
vii
principles.
we
contend,
as
submitted
in
our
briefs,
that
both
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history
show
that
the
pda
itself
does
not
govern
this
issue,
and
that
the
pda
itself
does
not
make
this
shipyard's
insurance
plan
unlawful
on
its
face.
in
amending
title
vii
with
respect
to
the
pda,
congress
did
not
add
a
new
substantive
provision
or
make
it
a
new
separate
act,
but
rather
chose
to
amend
the
definitional
section,
and
added
as
a
definition
under
section
701,
701(k),
the
first
clause
of
which
reads
"that
the
terms
because
of
sex
or
on
the
basis
of
sex
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
because
of
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy,
childbirth
or
related
medical
conditions.
"
except
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
instant
case,
all
other
courts
which
have
construed
this
language
have
interpreted
this
provision
to
be
simply
definitional,
and
that
it
must
be
read
into
the
substantive
provisions
of
title
vii.
indeed,
drew
days
in
the
same
testimony
that
he
gave
to
the
house
as
assistant
attorney
general
in
support
of
the
pda
noted
that
in
fact
on
pages
171
and
i
believe
172
of
the
house
hearings
that
in
fact
what
congress
was
doing
with
those
terms
was
putting
them
into
the
substantive
provisions
of
title
vii.
if
congress
had
felt
otherwise,
it
is
curious
why
congress
would
have
put
the
terms
"because
of
sex
or
on
the
basis
of
sex.
"
in
quotation
marks,
since
those
terms,
while
not
the
specific
language,
but
the
terms
703
of
title
vii,
which
are
the
very
sections
requiring
employers,
labor
organizations,
other
individuals
to
take
certain
affirmative
steps
with
respect
to
equal
opportunity.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--i
think
that's
a
title
vii
sex
discrimination
claim,
your
honor.
and
i
think
clearly
there
are
cases...
in
fact,
cases
prior
to
gilbert...
dealing
with
spousal
benefits
where--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--because
the
government
says
that
on
its
face,
your
honor,
in
this
case
we
are
required
to
provide,
even
where
we
provide
spousal
benefits
to
the
spouses
of
males...
males
and
females,
that
we
have
an
additional
affirmative
obligation.
if
we
provide
those
benefits,
we
must
also
provide
for
hospitalization
benefits
for
pregnancy.
as
in
this
case,
hospitalization
benefits
happen
to
be
provided
to
a
substantial
degree.
the
government
says
that
degree
isn't
enough
because
the
pda
requires
you
to
cover
it
fully.
our
position
is
that
doesn't
violate
title
vii.
the
employees'
compensation
is
the
same
in
this
case.
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
that
a
male
employee
is
receiving
less
compensation
than
his
female
counterpart.
now,
the
government's
position
is
not
the
one
you
articulated,
justice
o'connor.
the
government's
position
is
not
having
to
do
with
providing
one
sex
or
the
other
no
benefits
or
some
benefit.
the
government's
position
is
if
you
provide
equal
benefits,
as
we
contend
are
provided
with
respect
to
pregnancy,
you
have
to
provide
additional
coverage,
additional
risk
coverage.
and
i
think
that's...
but
we
would
believe
that
you
look
to
title
vii.
we're
not
contending
this
isn't
a
title
vii
case.
we're
simply
saying
it's
not
governed
by
the
pda.
in
fact,
interestingly
enough,
your
honor,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
second
clause
of
the
pda,
which
we
believe
amplifies
congressional
intent,
it
also
to
some
degree
answers
your
question.
that
clause
says,
"women
affected
by
pregnancy
shall
be
treated
the
same
for
fringe
benefit
purposes
or
employment-related
purposes,
including
the
receipt
of
fringe
benefits,
as
other
persons
not
so
affected
but
similar
in
their
ability
and
inability
to
work.
"
the
government
would
have
us
believe
that
for
the
first
time
congress
has
made
an
express
mandate
in
title
vii
that
the
term
"other
persons"
and
"women
affected"
are
not
terms
limited
to
employees
or
applicants
to
employment.
for
the
first
time
congress,
according
to
the
government,
has
revolutionized
title
vii
by
directly
affecting
spousal
behavior
or
employer
obligations
with
respect
to
spouses
and
dependents.
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
pda
cannot
be
read
that
way;
that
the
pda
in
terms
of
a
logical
document
within
title
vii
itself
and
its
legislative
history
cannot
support
that.
now,
what
is
remaining,
however,
is
the
question
of...
and
by
the
way,
it's
cited
in
both
briefs;
they're
replete
with
references
to
the
legislative
history.
and
i
would
just
note
when
deciding
gilbert,
the
court
noted
that
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
sex
discrimination
ban
original
in
title
vii
was
relatively
sparse.
i
would
contend
with
all
the
documents
that
are
cited
in
the
brief,
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
the
pda
was
anything
but
sparse.
and
that
in
fact
congress
clearly
evidenced
its
concern
that
this
court's
decision
in
gilbert
operated
as
a
direct
barrier
to
women
workers
in
the
work
force.
and
the
second
clause
was
put
in,
i
believe,
and
if
one
reads
the
legislative
history
by
congress,
for
the
fact
that
gilbert
was
more
than
one
holding.
gilbert
did
not
just
go
off
on
gender.
gilbert
also
went
off
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
discriminatory
effects,
whether
the
given
health
insurance
plan
in
that
case
actually
provided
more
or
less
benefits.
the
evidence
as
found
in
the
record
in
that
case
was
that
women
were
receiving...
that
is,
the
case
of
gilbert...
that
women
were
receiving
more
benefits.
well,
interestingly
enough,
the
second
clause
says
whether
or
not
the
value
is
equal,
mr.
employer,
you
have
a
comprehensive
program,
you
have
to
provide
it.
i
would
contend
that
the
similarity
between
a
female
spouse
of
a
male
employee
and
the
working
woman
that
congress
was
concerned
about
when
it
passed
the
pda
are
entirely
dissimilar,
and
the
individuals
are
not
only
similarly
situated,
but
the
individuals
and
the
policy
considerations
with
respect
to
them
are
quite
varied
and
distinct.
the
hearings
on
the
pda
in
fact
emphasized
this
fact...
the
cost
added...
that
is
now
relied
upon
by
the
government
so
extensively
in
its
brief.
it
is
interesting
to
me
that
the
government
in
its
brief
cites
the
senate
report
indicating...
and
this
is
at
pages
32
and
33
of
the
government's
brief,
note
32...
indicating
support
for
the
proposition
that
congress
in
considering
the
cost
of
the
pda
obviously
considered
the
cost
of
both
dependents
as
well
as
employees.
and
it
cites
the
fact
that
the
senate
report
in
a
footnote
noted
that
it
found
certain
plans
to
be
perfectly
legal
and
other
plans
to
be
discriminatory.
and
it
said
in
their
brief
that
those
plans
encompass
both
employees,
dependents
and
spouses.
the
government,
however,
forgot
to
add
the
following
words
that
fit
in
that
footnote:
"what
percentage
of
women
employees
are
covered
by
such
discriminatory
plans
cannot
be
calculated.
"
the
focus
of
congress
when
it
came
to
cost,
when
it
came
to
concern
as
to
why
there
was
a
need
for
the
pda,
was
not
male
employees.
the
senate
report
expressly
noted
that
the
issue
of
dependent
coverage
of
male
employees
would
have
to
be
decided
not
on
the
basis
of
the
pda
but
on
existing
title
vii
principles...
a
position
earlier
adopted
by
the
eeoc
but
subsequently
changed
during
the
course
of
this
and
other
litigation.
now
the...
and
one
other
point
i
would
make.
one
significant
colloquy
during
the
senate
debates
occurred
between
senators
hatch
and
senator
williams.
senator
williams,
of
course,
was
the
chairman
of
the
committee
having
primary
responsibility
for
the
bill.
senator
williams
was
probably
the
primary
sponsor
and
member
of
the
senate's
conference
committee
team.
senator
williams
was
asked
directly
by
senator
hatch
whether
if
the
terms
"women
affected
by
pregnancy"
only
refers
to
employees
and
no...
or
women
employees
and
no
one
else.
senator
williams
said
"exactly".
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
under
that
reading
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
it's
not
our
position,
no.
our
position
was
that
perhaps
the
term
703(a)(2).
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
our
emphatic
reliance
is
because
i
think
it's
a
pretty
direct
quote
on
the
issue.
i
think
with
respect
to
applicants,
whether
senator
hatch
considered
them
to
be
having
a
nexus
in
the
employment
process
or
not,
i'm
not
sure.
but
it
seems
to
me
clearly
the
first
clause
governs
applicants,
because
the
first
clause
directly
goes
into
703(a)(2).
703(a)(2)
by
its
very
terms
speaks
not
just
with
respect
to
employees
but
of
applicants
for
employment.
so
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
mandate...
and
by
the
way,
it
is
possible,
your
honor,
that
the
second
clause
does
not
in
fact
cover
applicants,
since
applicants
would
probably
never
enjoy
a
disability
or
fringe
benefit
until
they
became
an
employee.
so
i
think
senator
williams
might
have
given
the
exact
answer
with
respect
to
that
clause,
since
that
clause
is
specifically
tied
to
fringe
benefits,
something
that
would
normally
not
be
enjoyed
by
an
applicant.
i
think
then
the
critical
question
for
the
court
is
what
principles
should
the
court
apply
and
what
are
the
principles
if
the
pda
doesn't
govern,
because
we
have
a
title
vii
case.
we
have
a
case
where
congress
has
expressly
rejected,
at
least
in
part,
the
notion
that
pregnancy
should
be
unprotected
with
respect
to
title
vii.
so
the
question
is
what
remains,
and
how
do
we
fashion
in
this
case
a
remedy.
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
pregnancy
classifications
are
without
protection.
what
this
court
has
held
in
cases
such
as
satty,
and
in
gilbert,
is
that
pregnancy
classifications
on
its
face
is
not
per
se
discriminatory.
in
gilbert
there
were
at
least
two
concurring
justices
who
noted,
in
fact,
that
their
concurrences
were
on
the
basis
that
it
was
not
a
per
se
violation
and
that
therefore
the
government
had
the
burden,
or
in
that
case
private
plaintiffs,
of
proof.
now,
the
government
here,
interestingly
enough,
in
its
complaint
alleges
not
a
violation
of
701(k),
but
rather
alleges
a
violation
of
703(a)
of
title
vii,
and
most
specifically
the
compensation
provisions
of
703(a)(1),
and
goes
on
to
allege
intentional
discrimination,
of
which
there
is
absolutely
no
proof
in
this
record.
so
what
do
we
have
from
the
principles
of
this
court
that
can
be
applied
to
resolve
this
case?
first,
this
court
has
recognized,
as
i
said
before,
that
the
issue
was
not
simply
whether
pregnancy
is
made
a
classifying
factor,
but
whether
discrimination
has
occurred.
the
court
has
never
held
that
a
limitation
or
exclusion
of
pregnancy
itself
constitutes
a
per
se
violation
of
the
act.
as
shown
in
such
cases
as
gilbert,
satty
and
manhart,
there
is
a
need
for
a
plaintiff
to
show
that
there
is
in
fact
a
difference
in
compensation.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
to
me,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
proper
to
read
gilbert
from
the
standpoint
of
saying
that
there
is
still
a
burden...
that
pregnancy
per
se
with
respect
to
dependents
we're
talking
about,
is
not
a
per
se
classification,
and
that
there
must
be
a
showing
that
in
fact
discrimination
occurred.
and
we
put
an
example...
for
an
example,
because
i
think
this
ties
in
to
how
the
court
evolved
from
gilbert;
it
went
from
gilbert
to
satty...
where,
for
example,
justice
powell
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
a
footnote
noted
he
thought
gilbert
dealt
with
the
question
of
equality
of
compensation.
manhart
related
the
fact
that
in
gilbert
there
was
no
showing
that
the
plan
was
worth
more
to
men
than
to
women.
and
to
me
i
think
that
portion
of
gilbert
still
stands.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
i
would
say
justice
rehnquist,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
portions
of
justice
brennan's
opinion
which
were
followed,
just
as
your
dissent
in
gilbert
was
followed,
was
followed
for
the
policy
reason
that
working
women
were
the
ones
being
disadvantaged.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
result
would
have
been,
and
i
certainly
would
be
the
last
person
to
guess,
if
it
was
a
male
employee
who
was
contending
that
his
spouse
was
being
discriminated
when
gilbert
came
up.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
think
the
policy
considerations
are
entirely
different.
you
noted
in
your
dissent
in
gilbert
that
the
risk...
it
was
an
equal
risk
coverage
because
the
woman
would
still
be
absent
from
work
with
no
income.
those
types
of
considerations
have
no
application,
from
my
perspective,
to
the
spouse
of
a
male.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--yes,
it
is.
but
i
think,
your
honor,
there's
one
part
of
the
legislative
history
you
can
look
at.
congress
felt
that
portions
of
the
satty
decision
were
in
fact
consistent
with
what
they
were
doing.
and
i
think
satty,
as
i
said,
evolves
better
framework.
what
i'm
contending
here
is
the
government
in
this
case
alleged
intentional
discrimination.
they
didn't
allege
the
pda
per
se.
they
alleged
under
section
703(a),
intentional
discrimination,
of
which,
your
honor,
there
is
no
proof.
the
shipyard's
insurance
program
covers
a
number
of
risks.
it
also
includes
a
number
of
risks.
as
in
the
case
of
pregnancy
benefit,
it
limits
certain
coverage
of
certain
risks.
as
recognized
in
manhart,
when
insurance
risks
are
grouped,
the
better
risk
always
subsidizes
the
poorer
ones,
the
healthy
versus
the
unhealthy,
the
single
versus
the
married,
the
individual
with
smaller
family
size
will
subsidize
the
individuals
with
larger
family
size.
the
monetary
value
of
this
plan
is
perceived
by
the
government
and
the
court
below
to
essentially
be
the
fact
that
mr.
mcnulty
had
to
go
into
his
pocket,
pull
out
some
money
because
of
the
fact
that
this
plan
only
covered
pregnancy
for
$500
for
hospital
expenses,
but
as
shown
in
the
appendix,
certain
individuals
received
far
more
because
the
plan
is
more
generous
than
just
$500,
and
that
a
female
employee
with
a
spouse
would
never
have
to
do
it.
well,
it's
true.
a
female
employee
with
a
spouse
probably
never
has
to
face
the
risk
of
pregnancy
for
that
spouse.
that
is
clearly
true.
but
the
plan
being
offered
here
covers
risk
identically.
the
same
plan
that
mr.
mcnulty
has
is
the
same
one
given
to
a
female
employee.
the
risk
coverage
and
the
benefit
coverage
of
these
plans
are
equal
except
for
one
fact:
when
it
comes
to
the
spousal
component
of
this
plan,
male
employees
with
pregnant
spouses
are
covered
for
an
additional
risk.
the
$1,000
that
someone
alleges
in
the
appendix
he
already
received
for
pregnancy
benefits
is
a
$1,000
that
some
other
group
of
employee
is
subsidizing.
pregnancy
in
this
case
is
an
additional
covered
risk
under
this
plan.
now,
does
that
mean
that
mr.
mcnulty
got
more
compensation?
no.
the
value
of
the
plan
is
as
to
the
risks
that
are
covered.
they
will
fall
regardless
of
sex.
some
will
be
sex-related...
a
vasectomy
in
the
case
of
a
male...
but
there's
probably
a
comparable
situation
with
respect
to
a
female.
those
things
will
fall
not
because
of
sex
per
se,
but
because
of
factors
of
illness,
age
and
health.
unlike
the
fourteenth
amendment
cases
so
heavily
relied
upon
by
at
least
the
afl-cio
in
its
amicus
brief
and
the
government
to
some
degree
in
its
own
brief,
those
cases,
to
us,
have
no
application.
first
of
all,
frontiero
was
expressly
distinguished
by
this
court
in
geduldig
v.
aiello,
as
well
as
reed
v.
reed.
but
more
importantly,
first
of
all,
there
was
either
a
total
denial
of
benefits
in
those
cases,
such
as
the
hypothetical
justice
o'connor
gave,
or
the
individuals
were...
not
only
a
total
denial,
but
the
individuals
were
similarly
situated.
here,
i
would
strongly
contend
that
the
individual
employee
and
the
individual
spouse,
female
employee,
female
spouse,
are
not
similarly
situated.
the
eeoc's
position
with
respect
to
this
case
cannot
be
given
any
weight.
first
of
all,
it's
been
an
ever-changing
position.
they
now
look
to,
in
the
appendix,
letters
sent
of
senator
javits
to
support
what
might
be
existing
title
vii
principles.
this
can
only
be
analogous
to
private
correspondence.
there
is
no
reference
by
senator
javits
on
the
floor
debates
of
which
he
participated,
nor
is
there
any
reference
by
senator
javits
or
any
other
member
of
the
committee
in
the
committee
report
to
this
correspondence.
and
interestingly
enough,
the
court
might
pay
attention
to
the
first
letter
that
was
sent
to
senator
javits,
since
in
that
letter
the
commission
said
under
their
view
title
vii
would
be
satisfied
if
an
employer
simply
provided
the
female
employee
the
same
medical
cost
benefit
as
the
male
spouse...
a
position
which
congress
did
not
adopt,
but
equally
a
position
that
the
shipyard
was
in
prior
to
passage
of
the
pda.
the
policies
behind
title
vii
are
not
being
vindicated
by
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
since
the
pda
requires
or
gives
an
employer
an
option
to
reduce
benefits
to
come
into
compliance,
the
employer,
assuming
the
court
found
the
violation,
could
then
choose
to
reduce
benefits
which
go
to
all
employees
regardless
of
sex,
and
would
take
away
benefits
when
we're
only
talking
about
in
this
case
an
additional
risk,
a
risk
that
is
already
being
covered.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
just
a
few
points,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i'd
just
point
out
on
page
29
of
the
appendix
the
following
paragraph
is
in
a
complaint
since
at
least
july
2nd,
'65
and
continuing
up
to
the
present
time,
"defendant
newport
news
shipbuilding
and
drydock
has
intentionally
engaged
in
unlawful
employment
practices
in
violation
of
section
703(a)
of
title
vii.
"
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--our
client
knows
what
it's
doing,
but
as
said
in
cases
like
pullman
v.
swint,
there
has
to
be
motive
or
proof.
what
our
client
did
was
act
in
compliance
with
what
it
thought
was
a
congressional
mandate
under
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
there
is
no
showing
that
the
original--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--no.
absolutely
not.
there's--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--going
to
the
question,
though,
you
raised
both
of
myself
and
counsel
for
the
government
about
essentially
the
impact
of
gilbert,
i
would
just
like
to
leave
one
point.
the
second
clause
of
the
pda
clearly
mandated
that
employer
fringe
benefit
programs
put
pregnancy
benefits,
whether
they're
equal
of
value
or
not
equal
of
value,
treat
pregnancy
the
same
as
you
would
treat
any
other
fringe
benefit.
that
removed
any
of
the
value
issues
or
valuation
questions
with
respect
to
employees
that
the
court
dealt
with
in
gilbert.
the
government
now
says
we
don't
address
the
terms
"other
persons".
i
would
point
out
in
our
brief
we
note
that
the
senate
committee
report,
the
house
committee
report,
and
the
conference
committee
report
when
using
the
terms
"other
persons"
actually
don't
use
those
terms;
they
use
the
term
"employees".
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
that's
right.
and
there
also
has
to
be
proof
of
such
discrimination
in
terms
of
one
of
the
prohibitory
effects
of
title
vii...
in
this
case
the
government
alleges
compensation
discrimination...
on
the
basis
of
that
person's
sex.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
not
to
me,
your
honor,
and
i
guess
that's--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--that's...
that's
our
problem.
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
yes.
the
question
you
get
to
there
is
is
whether
or
not
the
pregnancy
classification
itself
is
a
sex-based
classification,
which
means
you're
discriminating,
whether
you
discriminate
against
the
spouse
or
the
employee.
our
position
here
as
to
why
it
is
not
sex
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii
goes
a
little
further,
because
it's
not
just
the
question...
position
of
the
government
here
that
there
is
a
classification
of
pregnancy
which
they
contend
is
sex
discrimination.
it's
that
that
classification
has
resulted
in
less
compensation.
now,
i
would
say
and
submit
to
this
court
that
the
plan
that
is
before
this
court
results
not
in
less
compensation
to
the
male
employee,
including
the
male
employee
with
a
spouse,
because
the
same
risks
are
covered
for
under
the
health
insurance
package.
the
government
is
saying
the
problem
is
that
you
don't
go
far
enough
in
covering
that
risk.
now,
to
me
i
don't
think
there's
any
support
under
title
vii's
sex
discrimination
law
with
respect
to
it.
this
is
not
a
case
of
less
generous
benefits
as
alleged
by
government
counsel.
this
is
a
question
where
the
plan
covers
all
risk
equally
whether
you
have
a
pregnant
spouse,
whether
you
don't
have
a
pregnant
spouse,
whether
you're
male,
you're
female,
you're
black
or
white.
the
question
is
is
whether
congress
now
by
the
pda
has
changed
the
method
or
the
methodology
of
the
court
to
analyze
compensation
so
as
to
automatically
include
pregnancy
while
it
might
not
otherwise
include
anything
else
under
the
ambit
of
sex
discrimination.
and
i
think
that's
the
heart
of
the
government's
position.
thank--
mr.
andrew
m.
kramer
--it
goes
against
us
if
it
was
looked
in
isolation,
i
would
submit,
justice
o'connor,
to
the
purposes
behind
that
particular
statute.
and
one
has
to
query
whether
or
not
the
female
spouse
is
so
similarly
situated
as
the
female
employee
for
purpose
of
an
insurance
plan
like
this
which
already
provides
an
additional
risk
coverage
for
pregnancy
of
that
spouse
to
that
employee,
as
to
whether
or
not
congress'
general
observation
would
apply
equally
as
well.
and,
in
fact,
if
congress
had
so
intended,
it
would
have
been
easy
for
congress
to
put
in
the
second
clause
not
just
women
affected
by
pregnancy,
but
men
and
women
affected
by
pregnancy.
and
that
was
essentially
suggested
by
the
departments
of
justice,
the
eeoc,
and
the
department
of
labor
in
that
first
letter
to
senator
javits.
congress
chose
not
to
do
so.
i
would
submit
that
it
has
to
be
looked
at
within
the
entire
ambit
of
what
congress
was
grappling
with,
but
i
still
say
the
government
bears
the
burden.
it
is
not
a
per
se
case.
they
have
the
burden
for
getting
intent
of
at
least
showing
the
fact
that
the
compensation
plan
here
was
worth
less
to
the
male.
thank
you
very
much.
