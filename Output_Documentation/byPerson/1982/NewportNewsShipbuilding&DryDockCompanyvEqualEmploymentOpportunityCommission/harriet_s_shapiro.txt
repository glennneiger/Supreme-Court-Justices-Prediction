ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i
want
to
summarize
briefly
our
theory
of
the
case
which
is
based
on
our
reading
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
as
establishing
that
discrimination
based
on
pregnancy
is
discrimination
based
on
sex.
having
done
that,
i
will
then
discuss
why
we
believe
that
is
the
correct
way
to
read
the
statute.
title
vii
requires
that
employees
must
be
paid
without
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex.
fringe
benefits
are
part
of
that
pay,
including,
of
course,
insurance
plans
that
reimburse
employees
for
their
family
medical
expenses.
an
employer
cannot
offer
its
male
employees
less
health
insurance
than
its
female
employees.
therefore,
an
insurance
plan
that
provides
less
generous
coverage
to
male
employees
for
their
families
than
is
provided
to
female
employees
for
their
families
violates
title
vii,
because
on
its
face
it
discriminates
between
male
and
female
employees
on
the
basis
of
sex.
that
principle,
we
submit,
is
the
one
that
was
established
in
cases
like
frontiero,
wiesenfeld
and
wengler.
for
example--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--well,
only
if
the
discrimination
based
on
sex
is
discrimination
based
on...
i
mean
discrimination
based
on
pregnancy
is
discrimination
based
on
sex.
for
example,
a
plan
that
covers
25
days
of
hospitalization
for
husbands
but
only
20
days
for
wives
would
violate
title
vii,
because
male
employees,
the
only
ones
who
have
wives,
would
get
smaller
fringe
benefits
than
female
employees.
but
a
plan
that
covered
25
days
for
sons
and
20
days
for
daughters
wouldn't
violate
title
vii,
because
both
male
and
female
employees
may
have
daughters,
so
that
plan
would
affect
male
and
female
employees
equally.
a
plan
that
singles
out
spousal
pregnancies
and
provides
less
generous
coverage
for
them
than
for
other
dependent
medical
expenses
has
precisely
the
same
effect
as
an
express
limitation
on
benefits
for
wives
and
violates
title
vii
for
precisely
the
same
reason
if
distinctions
based
on
pregnancy
are
distinctions
based
on
sex.
we
submit
that
that's
what
the
pda
was
enacted
to
establish.
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
supports
that
view.
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
amended
the
general
definition
section
of
title
vii,
providing
expressly
that
discriminations
because
of
pregnancy
are
discriminations
because
of
sex.
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
suggests
that
general
principle
applies
only
to
female
employees.
indeed,
in
explaining
the
effect
of
the
new
definition,
the
statute
says
that
women
affected
by
pregnancy,
not
female
employees
affected
by
pregnancy,
shall
be
treated
the
same
for
all
employment-related
purposes,
including
fringe
benefits,
as
other
persons,
not
employees,
not
so
affected.
if
congress
had
intended
to
limit
the
new
definition
to
women
employees,
it
surely
would
not
have
referred
to...
it
would
have
referred
to
employees
instead
of
to
women
and
persons.
petitioner
argues
that
"because
of
pregnancy"
is
simply
to
be
read
into
the
substantive
provisions
that
prohibit
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
such
individual
sex,
but
that
substitution
argument
is
unpersuasive
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
turns
title
vii
into
a
statute
that
requires
special
treatment
for
women
workers,
although
the
fundamental
purpose
of
title
vii
has
always
been
to
provide
for
the
equality
of
treatment
of
all
workers.
and
it's
particularly
significant
that
in
enacting
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
congress
emphasized
that
it
was
not
intended
to
change
the
basic
principles
of
title
vii
law
regarding
sex
discrimination,
and
also
that
it
was
not
intended
to
require
special
benefits
for
women
workers.
second,
petitioner's
argument
assumes
that
congress
meant
to
say
that
the
denial
of
benefits
for
pregnancies
of
female
workers
was
sex-based,
while
the
denial
of
benefits
for
the
pregnancies
of
spouses
was
gender
neutral.
and
that's
not
the
kind
of
common
sense
view
of
pregnancy
that
congress
said
that
it
was
enacting
in
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
third,
petitioner
is
asking
for
a
narrowly
literal
reading
of
the
first
clause
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
but
such
a
narrow
literal
reading
makes
no
sense,
because,
in
fact,
the
substantive
provisions
of
title
vii
nowhere
contain
the
precise
phrase
"because
of
sex"
or
"on
the
basis
of
sex".
so
there...
if
you
read
it
as
literally
as
he
wishes
us
to,
there
is
nowhere
to
substitute
the
new
language.
finally,
even
if
you
can
read
an
ellipsis
into
the
statute,
the
substitution
approach
would
mean
that
only
the
federal
government
would
be
precluded
from
limiting
spousal
pregnancy
benefits,
because
only
section
717
of
title
vii,
which
applies
to
the
federal
government,
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
such
individual's
sex.
turning
to
the
second
clause,
petitioner
has
never
attempted
to
explain
the
reference
to
women
and
persons
rather
than
employees.
instead,
he
focuses
on
the
reference
to
"similar
in
their
ability
or
inability
to
work.
"
and
argues
that
that
phrase
must
be
read
as
a
restriction
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
to
female
employees,
as
if
it
read
"similar
in
their
ability
or
inability
to
work
for
the
particular
employer
involved.
"
of
course,
it
doesn't
say
that.
we
submit
that
in
context
that
phrase
must
be
read
as
a
functional
description
of
the
way
pregnancy
is
to
be
treated,
like
any
other
condition
that
affects
a
person's
ability
to
do
whatever
work
she
normally
performs,
whether
that's
housework
or
any
other
work.
indeed,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
a
major
aim
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
is
to
require
that
pregnancy
be
treated
like
any
other
functionally
comparable
disabling
condition.
it
may
not
be
singled
out
for
special
limitations.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
legislative
history,
particularly
the
discussion
in
the
senate
report
of
the
effect
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act's
amendment
of
title
vii
on
medical
benefits
for
dependents.
that
discussion
recognizes
that
at
some
future
date
the
kind
of
question
now
involved
in
this
case
may
arise;
that
is,
whether
an
employer
health
insurance
plan
that
covers
dependents
of
employees
may
limit
pregnancy
coverage
for
those
dependents.
instead
of
providing
a
direct
answer
to
that
question,
the
report
says
that
it
is
to
be
decided
by
applying
existing
title
vii
principles.
we
submit
that
that
means
title
vii
principles
as
clarified
by
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act.
you
don't
have
to
look
very
far
for
a
concise
summary
of
some
of
those
principles.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
they...
they...
i
certainly
don't
contend
they
spoke
with
absolute
clarity.
but
i
think
that
in...
you
have
to...
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history
in
the
context
in
which
they
used
those
words,
i
think
that
you...
the
best
reading
of
them
is
what
they
were
saying
was
that
they
didn't
know...
they
didn't
think
that
this
problem
existed
at
the
time
that
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
was
enacted...
and,
in
fact,
it
probably
didn't
exist...
that
this
was
a
problem
to
be
faced
down
the
road,
and
that
when
the
courts
had
to
face
it,
they
were
to
apply
existing
title
vii
principles,
existing
when
they
faced
it.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
i
think
it's
also
significant,
though,
that
even
if
you
say
it
meant
existing
at
the
day
they
were
speaking,
what
they
thought
were
existing
title
vii
principles,
in
fact,
in
that...
that...
the
discussion
of
the
medical
benefits
is
at
pages
5...
page
5
of
the
legislative
history,
5
and
6.
but
then
at
page
3
of
the...
i
mean
of
the
senate
report...
on
page
3
of
the
senate
report,
just
a
few
pages
before,
there's
a
section
that
is
entitled
"the
basic
principles".
and
that
section
starts
out,
it
says,
"this
bill
is
intended
to
make
plain
that
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
discrimination
based
on
pregnancy,
childbirth
and
related
medical
conditions
is
discrimination
based
on
sex.
"
"thus,
the
bill
defines
"sex
discrimination"
as
prescribed
in
the
existing
statute
to
include
those
physiological
occurrences
peculiar
to
women.
"
"it
does
not
change
the
application
of
title
vii
to
sex
discrimination
in
any
other
way.
"
"by
defining
sex
discrimination
to
include
discrimination
against
pregnant
women,
the
bill
rejects
the
view
that
employers
may
treat
pregnancy
and
its
incidence
as
sui
generis
without
regard
to
the
functional...
functional
comparability
to
other
conditions.
"
now,
if
they
were
saying
apply
gilbert,
gilbert
says
pregnancy
is
sui
generis.
congress
didn't...
was
saying
in
the...
precisely
in
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
don't
treat
pregnancy
as
sui
generis.
so
i
think
that
it's
fairly
clear
from
the
entire
legislative
history
that
what
the
pda
was
intended
to
do
was
to
establish
at
least
two
principles,
and
these
principles
the
congress
indeed
had
thought
were
always
part
of
title
vii:
first,
that
pregnancy
discrimination
is
sex
discrimination;
and
second,
that
pregnancy
may
not
be
treated
as
sui
generis.
those
principles,
together
with
the
fundamental
pre-existing
title
vii
principles
not
affected
by
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act,
that
neither
sex
is
to
be
favored
over
the
other
and
that
health
insurance
benefits
for
dependents
are
compensation
for
the
employee,
are
the
principles
to
be
applied
here.
there's
no
basis
in
the
legislative
history
for
petitioner's
claim
that
the
reference
to
existing
title
vii
principles
was
an
invitation
to
the
courts
to
apply
the
rationale
of
gilbert
to
spousal
pregnancy
benefits.
the
legislative
history
is
in
fact
remarkably
consistent
in
rejecting
the
rationale
of
gilbert.
the
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
pregnancy
discrimination
was
to
adopt
the
rationale
of
the
dissenters
in
gilbert,
and
that
pregnancy
discrimination
is,
on
its
face,
sex
discrimination
for
all
title
vii
purposes.
petitioner
has
claimed
that
the
eeoc
and
the
government
have
been
inconsistent
in
their
interpretations
of
the
effect
of
title
vii
on...
and
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
on
spousal
pregnancies.
in
fact,
the
eeoc
has
been
inconsistent
throughout.
i
think
petitioner's
problem
probably
is
that
they
see
the...
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
as
somehow
in
conflict
with
title
vii,
whereas
in
fact
it
is
an
amendment
of
title
vii.
congress
consistently
said
that
it
was...
that
title
vii...
that
it
was
to
be
interpreted
harmoniously
and
that
they
were
not
intending
to
put
in
through
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
anything
that
would
require
special
treatment
for
women
employees.
the
discussion
of
why
the
petitioner
believes
that
compensation
is
the
same
is
also
answered
by
the
legislative
history,
the
senate
report.
in
talking
about
medical
benefits
in
terms
of
the
applicability
to
female
employees,
the
senate
report
says,
"discrimination
against
female
employees
in
medical
plans
by
excluding
pregnancy
coverage
has,
of
course,
precisely
the
same
impact
as
discrimination
in
disability
plans.
"
"a
woman
who
is
obliged
to
apply
her
own
income
to
doctor
and
hospital
bills
although
male
employees
are
not
is
obviously
earning
less
for
the
same
work.
"
our
submission
is
simply
that
the
same
thing
applies
to
male
employees.
so
that
as
far
as
the
equality
of
costs
and
the...
argument
that...
and,
again,
petitioner
is
simply
asking
this
court
to
apply
gilbert
even
though,
as
we
submit,
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
has
said
that
the
principles
to
be
applied
are
those
of
the
dissenters
in
gilbert
rather
than
of
gilbert...
the
gilbert
majority.
finally,
the
petitioner
claims
that
the
eeoc
didn't...
did
not...
well,
that
the
eeoc
alleged
intentional
discrimination.
i
think
that
is
simply
incorrect.
the
complaint
on
the
joint
appendix
at
page
30
is...
and
the
paragraph
11
states
simply
that
the
petitioner
has
discriminated
and
is
discriminating
against
its
male
employees.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
intentional
discrimination.
and,
clearly,
our
submission
is
that
the
discrimination
is
facial
discrimination.
the...
finally,
the...
the
javits
correspondence
to
which
petitioner
refers
we
think
is
quite
significant
precisely
because
the...
this
was
the
statement
by
the
officials
who
were
responsible
for
interpreting
the
pda
as
in
the
title
vii
which
it
amended,
stating
what
they
thought
was
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
as
petitioner
himself
points
out,
when
the
senate
report
disagreed
with
the
interpretation
that
was
given,
it
said
so.
it
didn't
say
that
it
disagreed
with
the
interpretation
that
was
presented
there,
which
is
consistent
with
the
one
we're
arguing
here.
and,
therefore,
we
think
it's
a
fair
inference
that
they
agreed
with
that
interpretation.
that's...
unless
there
are
further
questions.
