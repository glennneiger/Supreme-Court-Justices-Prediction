ms.
oberly,
are
you
satisfied
with
a
standard
that
says
if
the
suit
furthered
the
goals
of
the
statute,
it
is
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
you
don't
prevail?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
do
you
think,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
think
the
court
below
applied
the
correct...
that
the
court
below
set
forth
the
correct
standard,
but
simply
applied
it
improperly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
a
party
who
loses
the
case
ever
further
the
goals
of
the
statute,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
respondents
cited,
i
think,
something
like
20
other
statutes,
federal
statutes,
for
attorney's
fees
that
do
not
require
that
the
party
have
prevailed.
is
there
any
other
statute
in
which
the
language
appropriate
has
been
used
and
has
been
interpreted,
as
it
was
in
this
case?
