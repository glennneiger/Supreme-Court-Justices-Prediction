justice

f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
tyler,
if
this
had
been
a
section
304
suit
and
the
defendant
had
been
a
small
to
medium
size
business,
would
you
be
making
this
same
argument
under
304?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
the
language
different?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
should
it
in
light
of
the
language?
couldn't
it
argue,
couldn't
it
be
argued
that
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
had
been
consistent
with
the
goals
of
the
act,
which
is
your
argument
basically?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
any
judge
would
award
fees
to
a
dead
loser
in
that
sort
of
case
against
a
small
business?
