justice
thurgood
marshall
--could
it
be
said
that
this
action
speeded
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
took
them
more
than
ten
years
to
get
around
to
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
'70.
i
thought
that's
what
you
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
had
it
not
been
for
this
statute,
would
you
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
seem
to
say
the
statute
forced
epa
to
do
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
my
question
is
if
the
statute
had
not
been
passed,
would
you
have
said
that
the
lawsuit
did
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
didn't
the
action
remind
epa
that
they
should
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
wasn't
an
abuse
of
discretion
case,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
wasn't...
and
this
you
admit
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
case?
you
admit
that?
