ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
clean
air
act
case
in
which
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
ordered
the
government
to
pay
respondents
$90,000
in
attorney's
fees
even
though
they
were
completely
unsuccessful
on
the
merits
of
their
lawsuit.
the
government
challenges
this
fee
award
because
we
don't
believe
that
congress
has
authorized
attorney's
fees
for
totally
unsuccessful
parties.
the
case
began
in
1979
when
respondents
filed
petitions
for
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
challenging
epa's
new
source
performance
standards
for
coal-fired
generating
plants.
edf,
the
environmental
defense
fund
didn't
challenge
the
substance
of
the
regulations
at
all.
instead,
it
argued
that
epa
had
had
meetings
with
people
outside
of
the
agency
after
the
close
of
the
public
comment
period
and
that
those
meetings
had
resulted
in
a
less
stringent
standard
being
adopted
than
would
have
otherwise
been
the
case.
the
sierra
club
challenged
epa's
statutory
authority
to
adopt
the
type
of
performance
standard
that
it
did
and
it
also
claimed
that
the
rule
was
unsupported
by
evidence
in
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
each
and
every
one
of
respondent's
arguments
and
upheld
the
epa
standards
in
every
respect.
the
court
did
write
an
extremely
lengthy
and
comprehensive
opinion
on
the
merits,
but
nowhere
in
that
opinion
did
the
court
suggest
that
its
decision
to
uphold
the
regulations
was
a
close
one
or
that
epa
had
in
any
way
acted
improperly
during
the
rulemaking.
after
the
decision
on
the
merits,
respondents
sought
attorney's
fees
under
section
307(f)
of
the
clean
air
act.
that
section
provides
that
in
any
judicial
proceeding
to
review
epa
regulations
a
court
may
award
reasonable
attorney
fees
whenever
it
determines
that
a
fee
award
would
be
"appropriate".
the
dispute
in
this
case
is
about
what
congress
meant
by
the
use
of
the
word
appropriate.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
we're
happy
to
take
that
burden
on,
your
honor,
because
we
believe
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
when
one
looks
at
congress's
purposes
in
enacting
this
statute,
it
becomes
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
or
contemplate
that
attorney's
fees
would
be
awarded
to
losing
parties,
who
neither
prevailed
in
the
technical
sense
of
obtaining
a
final
judgment
in
court,
nor
prevailed
in
the
nontechnical
sense
of
getting
the
agency
to
change
its
conduct,
change
the
regulations
or
in
any
way
alter
its
administration
of
the
act.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
we
think
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
meant
two
things.
there
were
two
classes
of
plaintiff...
of
litigants
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
the
first
class
was
prevailing
defendants,
which
would
include
the
government,
who
were
subjected
to
frivolous
or
harassing
litigation
and
the
second
class
would
be
plaintiffs
who
either
won
in
court
in
the
traditional
sense
of
obtaining
a
judgment
or
who
achieved
the
result
they
set...
or
something
close
to
the
result
they
set
out
to
achieve
without
obtaining
a
formal
judgment.
that
could
be
done,
for
example,
by
a
settlement
or
by
epa
agreeing
to
change
its
regulations,
by
something
short
of
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits.
but
there
is
no
indication,
your
honor,
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
understood
that,
or
thought
that
it
was
authorizing
fees
to
parties
whose
only
contribution
to
the
clean
air
act
was
to
have
a
court
validate
precisely
what
the
agency
had
done.
the
court
of
appeals
standard
in
this
case
is
that
attorney's
fees
are
appropriate
whenever
a
party
substantially
contributes
to
the
goals
of
the
clean
air
act
and
on
its
face,
we
don't
have
a
real
quarrel
with
that
standard.
our
problem
is
with
the
standard
as
applied
to
this
and
other
cases
like
it
where
the
plaintiffs,
or
the
petitioners,
have
failed
to
accomplish
anything
concrete
for
the
purposes
of
the
clean
air
act.
the
court
found
that
the
way
respondents
had
contributed
to
the
goals
of
the
clean
air
act
was
by
labeling
judicial
review
itself
as
an
express
and
an
overriding
goal
of
the
statute
and
then
it
found
that
respondents
had
contributed
to
that
goal
here
by
making
exemplary
presentations
on
novel,
important
and
complex
issues.
our
problem
with
that
ruling
is
that
congress
has
never
said
in
the
statute,
which
does
set
out
the
goals
of
the
statute,
that
judicial
review
is
an
overriding
goal,
an
express
goal
or
any
goal
at
all
of
the
clean
air
act.
it's
quite
clear
from
the
purposes
of
the
statute
that
the
primary
goal
of
the
statute
and
the
relevant
one
to
this
case
is
to
improve
and
maintain
the
quality
of
the
nation's
air
and
when
epa
fails
to
do
that
by
not
following
congress'
instructions,
then
judicial
review
does
help
to
further
that
goal.
but
when
epa
has
already
done
what
congress
told
it
to
do,
judicial
review
for
its
own
sake
is
not
a
statutory
goal
and
it's
certainly
not
one
that
congress
had
indicated
it
wanted
to
subsidize
with
attorney's
fee
awards.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
our
problem
is
that
we
think
it's
impossible
to
further
the
goals
of
the
statute
when
a
party--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--when
a
party
wins
nothing
on
the
merits
and
in
no
way
alters
or
improves
or
changes
epa's
administration
of
the
statute.
because
to
do
that
one
would
have
to
find...
to
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
one
would
have
to
find
the
judicial
review
just
for
the
sake
of
validating
what
the
agency
already
correctly
did
is
a
goal
of
the
statute.
and
that
is
not
anywhere
set
out
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
as
a
goal
that
congress
was--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--we
think
the
court
of
appeals
standard
is
perfectly
plausible,
given
the
guidance
that
congress
provided
in
the
legislative
history.
the
party
who
contributes
to
the
goals
of
the
clean
air
act
may,
in
fact,
be
entitled...
there
may
be
other
factors
in
a
particular
case
that
would
make
an
award
inappropriate
but,
in
general,
a
party
who
contributes
to
the
goals
of
the
clean
air
act
would
be
entitled
to
fees.
our
problem
here
is
that
these
respondents
have
done
absolutely
nothing
to
contribute--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
your
honor,
not
if
they
not
only
lose
on
the
merits
in
the
technical
sense
of
failing
to
obtain
a
judgment,
but
also
lose
in
the
broader
sense
of
failing
to
alter
epa's
conduct
or
alter
the
regulations
or
the
statute,
i
might
add,
applies
not
only
to
the
government
as
defendant,
but
to
private
corporations
as
defendant
and
if
they
are
unable,
through
their
lawsuit,
as
a
catalyst,
to
get
a
private
defendant
to
change
his
behavior
or
its
behavior,
a
corporation's
behavior,
even
short
of
a
judgment,
then
we
would
say
that
fees
could
not
be
appropriate.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
statutes
that
respondents
cited,
and
i
believe
there
are
about
14
of
them,
are
all
where
appropriate
statutes.
in
other
words,
their
language
is
all...
the
statutes
they're
citing
have
identical
language
to
the
statute
that
the
court
is
construing
today.
but
in
none
of
those
statutes
is
there,
just
like
the
clean
air
act,
there's
no
legislative
history
to
indicate
the
congress
thought
it
was
authorizing
fee
awards
to
parties
who
failed
to
prevail
in
court
or
out
of
court,
and
so
they've
not,
in
our
opinion,
added
anything
to
the
statute
that
you
have
before
the
court.
they've
added
congress
using
the
same
language
in
other
statutes,
but
again,
no
additional
evidence
that
congress
contemplated
the
idea
of
paying
fees
to
totally
unsuccessful
parties.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
when
i
say
totally
unsuccessful
i
mean
not
just
unsuccessful
in
court,
but
unsuccessful
out
of
court.
they
failed
to
obtain
a
settlement
out
of
court,
they
failed
to
change
the
defendant's
conduct
in
any
way,
not
just
that
they
failed
to
obtain
a
technical
judgment
in
their
favor.
it's
particularly
striking--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--pardon.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
sierra
club
in
the
mid,
early
to
mid-70's
asked
epa
to
consider
this
kind
of
rulemaking
and
epa
had
sierra
club's
petition
for
rulemaking
under
consideration
when--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
it
did
not
take
then
ten
years,
your
honor.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
said
in
the
mid,
excuse
me,
early
to
mid-70's
was
when
they
first
approached
epa
but
without
a
formal
request.
they
then
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
asked
that
epa
be
ordered
to
initiate
this
rulemaking.
the
court
of
appeals
told
the
sierra
club,
file
a
formal
petition
with
epa
and
epa
will
consider
it.
while
that
petition
was
under
consideration,
and
it
had
not
been
under
consideration
for
very
long
at
this
point,
congress
passed
the
1977
clean
air
act
amendments.
those
amendments
ordered
epa
to
do
precisely
the
rulemaking
that
sierra
club
had
asked
for.
and
so
it
was
congress...
and
it
gave
a
statutory
deadline,
and
epa
later
found
itself
under
a
court
order
deadline
to
meet
the
timetable
that
congress
had
set.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
the
statute
directed
epa--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--no,
your
honor,
because
if
the
statute
had
not
been
passed,
it
probably
would
have
been
fully
within
epa's
discretion
to
decline
to
initiate
a
rulemaking
proceeding.
the
passage
of
the
statute
makes
it
impossible
to
tell
now
whether
or
not
epa
would
have
undertaken
a
rulemaking
in
response.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
it
wasn't
clear
until
the
statute
was
passed,
your
honor,
that
epa
should
do
it.
prior
to
that
time
it
was
a
matter
of
discretion
with
epa
and
because
of
the
intervening
passage
of
the
statute
there
really
is
no
way
of
telling
now,
in
hindsight,
whether
epa
would
acted
favorably
on
sierra
club's
petition
or
not.
and
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
congress
ordered
epa
to
undertake
this
rulemaking
and
epa
did
it
in
response
to
the
statute.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
judges
ought
to
get
higher
salaries
to
plow
through
the
opinion,
but
respondents
took
this
task
upon
themselves
voluntarily
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
government
has
as
good
a
claim
to
having
contributed
to
the
public
interest
and
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute
as
do
respondents.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
it
would
be
somewhat
like
a
rule
that
this
court
might
promulgate
where
parties
filing
amicus
briefs
would
get
paid
simply
because
the
court
found
the
amicus
brief
more
helpful
than
the
party's
brief.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
you
would
have
to
look
to
the
guidance
of
your
statute,
if
you
had
one.
and
when
you
look
to
the
guidance
of
the
clean
air
act,
you
don't
find
that
congress
thought
that
the
justice
department
needed
assistance
from
self-volunteering
public
interest
groups
to
help
in
defending
epa
regulations.
they
may,
in
fact,
provide
such
assistance
in
such
cases,
but
it's
not
something
that
can
go
into
expecting
the
government
to
pay
the
bill
when
we're
already
paying
our
own
lawyers
to
defend
these
regulations.
and
in
this
case,
epa
filed
a
200
page
brief
on
the
merits
and
epa
felt,
the
justice
department
felt
that
it
could
defend
its
own
interests.
we
did
not
ask
for
help
from
the
sierra
club
or
the
environmental
defense
fund.
the
fact
that
they
wanted
to
offer
it
is
their
decision,
but
there's
no
indication
that
congress
thought
that
the
government
needed
help
from
public
interest
groups
in
defending
its
own
interests.
that's
simply
mentioned
nowhere
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history.
an
important
point
that
i'd
like
to
stress
is
that
congress
has
expressly
considered
legislation
that
would
authorize
fees
for
parties
who
don't
prevail
at
all.
an
early
version
of
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
expressly
had
such
a
provision
in
it.
the
justice
department
objected
to
that
proposal
as
being
radical
and
unacceptable
and
congress
immediately
dropped
it
from
the
act
so
that
the
act
as
passed
now
requires
a
plaintiff
to
prevail.
the
fact
is
that
congress
has
never
passed
a
statute
that
says
the
winning
party
is
to
pay
the
other
side's
attorney's
fees,
even
though
it
has
had
the
opportunity
to
consider
legislation
that
would
do
that.
on
the
other
hand,
in
several
statutes
cited
in
our
brief,
congress
has
authorized
the
payment
of
attorney's
fees
just
to
allow
citizens
to
participate
in
agency
rulemaking
proceedings,
even
when
their
views
are
not
adopted.
so,
there's
no
question
that
congress
knows
how
to
draft
the
kind
of
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
read
into
the
statute
in
this
case.
but
the
obvious
fact
is
that
that
language
just
isn't
here.
respondents
claim
that
if
the
government's
position
were
correct,
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
congress
to
change
from
the
prevailing
party
standard
that
it's
used
in
other
statutes
and
switch
to
an
appropriate
standard.
but
what
they've
overlooked
is
that
in
1970,
which
is
the
year
that
this
type
of
standard
was
first
passed,
the
courts
were
interpreting
prevailing
to
mean
that
a
party
had
to
have
a
technical
final,
favorable
judgment
in
his
favor
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
fees.
it
wasn't
until
at
least
1976
or
1977
that
the
courts
started
liberalizing
the
interpretation
of
prevailing
party
so
that
in
1970,
for
example,
when
the
origin
of
this
statute
first
came
into
being,
a
party
who
prevailed
by
way
of
settlement
would
not
necessarily
have
been
treated
as
a
prevailing
party
for
purposes
of
an
attorney's
fee
award.
and
it
was,
therefore,
necessary
in
1970
for
congress
to
adopt
a
different
standard
than
the
prevailing
party
standard
in
order
to
bring
in
to
that
group
of
plaintiffs
eligible
for
fee
awards
plaintiffs
who
accomplish
their
result
without
getting
a
favorable
final
judgment.
that
situation,
that
state
of
the
law
is,
as
regards
the
meaning
of
prevailing
party,
continued
up
through
1976,
1977,
in
fact
it
wasn't
until
1980
that
this
court
held
that
a
party
who
obtained
relief
by
way
of
settlement
could
be
deemed
a
prevailing
party
for
purposes
of
attorney's
fee
awards.
so,
in
our
view,
at
the
time
this
statute
was
first
passed
it
was,
in
fact,
necessary
for
congress
to
adopt
a
different
standard,
the
appropriate
standard.
but
that
doesn't
go
as
far
as
respondents
would
take
it
or
as
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
would
take
it
to
show
that
congress
actually
intended
or
even
thought
about
the
notion
of
paying
fees
to
parties
who
accomplish
no
tangible
benefit.
i
would
also
remind
the
court
that,
given
the
country's
long
tradition
against
fee
shifting,
and
given
the
fact
that
we're
aware
of
no
other
situation
in
which
a
winning
party
has
been
ordered
to
pay
a
losing
party's
fees,
it's
simply
not
plausible
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
passed
this
type
of
legislation
without
mentioning
it,
without
debating
it.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
under
the
criminal
justice
act.
you're
right,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
directly
against
the
opponent.
here,
this
is
the
victorious
party,
epa,
paying
the
other
side's
fees
and
what's
more
important,
or
equally
important,
is
that
the
statute
is
not
limited
to
the
government
as
defendant.
section
304
of
the
act,
the
citizen
suit
provision,
would
have
private
parties
being
a
defendant
as
often
as
the
government
and
i
find
it
implausible
to
think
that
congress
would
have
assessed
attorney's
fees
against
a
winning
corporate
defendant
without
saying
that
it
actually
meant
for
the
winning
corporate
defendant
to
pick
up
the
other
side's
legal
fees.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
that
congress
contemplated
that.
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
the
situation
here
is
really
quite
similar
to
what
the
court
had
before
it
in
lehman
v.
nakshian
where
the
court
took
a
look
at
what
congress's
strong
and
unbroken
prior
practice
had
been
with
respect
to
jury
trials
and
concluded
that
express
and
unequivocal
language
was
needed
before
the
court
would
presume
a
change
was
intended--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--it
was
a
statutory
construction
case
and
basically--
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
--and
it's
a
statutory
construction
case,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
interpreting
what
appropriate
means.
it's
first
a
statutory
construction
case
and
then,
did
the
court
of
appeals
abuse
the
discretion
once
the
statute
is
properly
interpreted.
i
think
it's
really
undisputed
in
this
case
by
respondents
that
they
didn't
win
any
of
their
claims
on
the
merits
and
so
what
we're
left
with
is
whether
they
still
somehow
helped
to
accomplish
a
goal
of
the
clean
air
act.
and
again,
we
think
judicial
review
is
not
a
goal
the
congress
set
in
and
of
itself.
so
all
respondents
can
claim
they
did
was
get
the
court
of
appeals
to
render
a
decision
validating
what
epa
had
already
done.
their
lawsuit
did
nothing
to
change,
improve,
alter
epa's
administration
or
implementation
of
the
clean
air
act.
they
claim
to
have
achieved
certain
public
benefits,
but
as
we
have
shown
in
our
reply
brief,
those
benefits
are
completely
lacking
in
substance
and
there
are
just
two
of
them
that
i'd
like
to
mention
here.
first,
edf
claims
that
it
forced
the
government
to
disclose
important
documents
that
had
never
before
been
revealed.
that
claim
is
simply
false.
what
epa,
excuse
me,
what
edf
wanted
was
to
depose
high-ranking
epa
officials
from
the
administrator
on
down.
that
request
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
inappropriate
and
unnecessary
and
instead,
what
edf
got
was
affidavits
describing
what
they
already
knew,
the
fact
that
meetings
had
taken
place.
so
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
this
case
isn't
even
as
strong
a
claim
for
fees
as
hanrahan
v.
hampton,
in
which
the
court
held
that
a
victory
on
procedural
issues
that
doesn't
relate
to
the
merits
is
insufficient
for
an
attorney's
fee
award.
here,
edf
didn't
even
get
the
procedural
victory
that
it
wanted
and
it
certainly
didn't
get
any
relief
on
the
merits.
edf
also
claims
that
the
court's
merits
opinion
changed
the...
caused
the
government
to
alter
the
way
it
handles
ex
parte
communications
in
rulemakings.
again,
that's
not
true.
the
court
found
that
epa's
procedures
were
just
fine
the
way
they
were
before
this
lawsuit
was
brought
and
edf
has
not
shown
that
those
procedures
have
been
altered
in
any
way
since
the
decision.
as
a
final
point,
i'd
like
to
make
it
clear
that
we're
not
downplaying
the
importance
of
allowing
citizen
plaintiffs
full
access
to
the
courts.
but
our
position
does
not
mean
that
that
access
will
be
cut
off.
if
the
court
holds
that
a
plaintiff
has
to
accomplish
something
concrete
before
it
can
expect
to
have
the
government
pick
up
the
bill,
it
will
still
be
sufficient
incentive,
economic
incentive,
for
plaintiffs
with
meritorious
cases
to
bring
suit.
that's
all
congress
ever
indicated
it
was
authorizing
and
we
believe
that
anything
going
beyond
that,
such
as
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
this
case,
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
inconsistent
with
the
statute
that
congress
has
written.
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
kathryn
a.
oberly
a
few
points,
your
honor.
mr.
tyler
accuses
the
government
of
focusing
on
the
1970
act
and
trying
to
ignore
what
happened
between
1970
and
1977.
but,
in
fact,
the
language
of
the
two
statutes
is,
word
for
word,
identical,
and
the
senate
report
in
1977
indicates
that
all
congress
wanted
to
do
in
1977
was
conform
the
two
sections
so
that
they
would
mean
the
same
thing.
so,
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
1970
legislative
history
is
the
relevant
legislative
history
that
the
court
has
to
examine.
there
is
one
other
final
point.
i'd
like
to
say
that
we
disagree
strongly
with
respondents
that
congress
has
evidenced
an
intent
to
encourage
litigation.
congress
has
made
it
possible
for
citizen
groups
to
litigate
when
they
want
to
and
has
done
so
by
providing
that
they'll
be
paid
if
they
actually
accomplish
something,
but
we
have
read
the
legislative
history
in
the
statute
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
find
no
evidence
that
congress
was
trying
to
increase
litigation
or
to
encourage
litigation.
i'd
also
point
out
that
civil
rights
plaintiffs
who
have
to
prevail
in
their
statutes
have
not
been
discouraged
from
bringing
cases
by
the
requirement
of
prevailing.
to
say
that
congress
wants
to
encourage
litigation
is
really
to
say
something
that
has
never
been
said
on
the
floor
of
the
congress.
thank
you.
