justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
oberly,
may
i
ask
you
a
sort
of
a
hypothetical
question?
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
kind
of
a
three-cornered
case.
the
utilities
were
attacking
from
one
direction
and
the
sierra
club
from
the
other
direction.
supposing
there
were
an
argument
that
was
raised
by
the
utilities
in
its
attack
on
the
regulations
which
was
rejected
for
reasons
set
forth
in
the
sierra
club
brief,
but
not
set
forth
in
the
government
brief,
so
that
they
would
have
accomplished
nothing
but
they
might
have
helped
defeat
the
utilities.
would
it
be
appropriate
to
give
them
the
fees
in
that
event?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
congress
passed
a
statute
saying
we
can
give
fees
where
appropriate,
that
would
be
different.
see,
we
don't
have
such
a
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
oberly,
isn't
it
a
little
bit
of
an
overstatement
to
say
winning
party
never
pays
the
losing
party's
fees?
what
about
all
our
criminal
litigation?
