well,
mr.
tyler,
that
would
be
something
of
a
new
departure.
i
would
think
congress
would
have
said
so
in
so
many
words
if
they
had
intended
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
won
on
some
issues?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
a
perfectly
understandable
motive
if
congress,
indeed,
did
entertain
it.
but
my
question
still
remains,
why
didn't
they
spell
it
out
to
some
extent,
rather
than
simply
using
the
word
appropriate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tyler,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
the
same
result
wouldn't
have
been
reached
simply
if
the
government
had
defended
its
own
position
without
the
help
of
the
environmental
groups.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
occasionally.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
the...
where
you
have
a
fund
out
of
which
the
fees
are
paid.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
distinction
that
was
critical
in
alyeska.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
there
the
purpose
is
to
provide
the
criminal
defendant
with
an
attorney.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
criminal
justice
act
is
express
when
it
says
our
purpose
is
to
provide
a
criminal
defendant
with
an
attorney
in
every
case,
win
or
lose.
