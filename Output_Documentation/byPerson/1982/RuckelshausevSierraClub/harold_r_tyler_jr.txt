mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
harold
tyler
for
the
respondents,
sierra
club
and
environmental
defense
fund.
basically,
our
difficulties
and
disagreements
with
the
united
states
in
this
case
come
down
to
a
difference
in
reading
in
the
statutory
language
and
quite
a
substantial
difference
in
our
appraisal
of
the
legislative
history.
indeed,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
is
taking
a
rather
successively
naive
version
of
what
actually
happened
in
the
legislative
history.
to
begin
with,
as
you
know,
in
1970
this
language
did
come
into
the
clean
air
act
and
some
other
statutes
of
an
environmental
nature.
in
the
year
1970
section
304
was
the
area
and
the
type
of
suit
for
which
congress
did
pass
this
statute
saying
that
fees
could
be
awarded
when
appropriate.
unfortunately,
the
government
tends
to
ignore
what
happened
thereafter
leading
up
to
the
1977
amendments
which,
in
very
simple
terms,
we
urge,
made
it
very
clear
that
congress
specifically
was
trying
to
address
what
had
happened
in
the
intervening
years
in
terms
of
appropriate
judicial
review,
particularly
of
rulemaking.
congress
was
certainly
aware
that
section
304
did
not
specifically
authorize
petitions
to
review
regulations
or
rulemaking.
in
fact,
prior
to
1977
at
least
two
courts,
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit,
had
held
that
the
law
was
unclear
and
that
even
though
judge
levin
campbell,
speaking
for
the
first
circuit,
had
allowed
with
his
panel
a
petition
for
review
under
section
307,
congress
thought
that
they
should
address
that
problem.
and
so
they
did
by
passing
in
1977
very
specific
legislation
underscoring
a
congressional
tenet,
we
say,
to
encourage
citizens
and
groups
with
expertise
in
the
environmental
field
to
seek
review
of
epa
rulemaking.
now,
the
government
tosses
this
off
as
being
a
situation
where
they
didn't
ask
for
the
sierra
club
to
come
in.
they
didn't
ask
for
the
environmental
defense
fund
to
come
in,
and
all
of
this
would
have
been
resolved
very
much
easily,
more
easily,
much
more
timely,
had
there
not
been
this
petition
for
review,
which
you
know
about,
was
filed
in
this
important
case.
well,
the
fact
is,
we
urge
that
what
happened
is
that
congress
illustrated
very
clearly
that,
contrary
to
what
the
government
argues,
they
want
307
cases
to
keep
epa
honest,
to
put
it
in
simplistic,
blunt
terms.
but
more
importantly
and
more
fairly,
perhaps,
they
wish
to
encourage
outsiders,
particularly
outsiders
like
these
two
organizations,
who
have
competence
to
handle
these
complex
cases.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
that
of
course
congress
didn't
have,
the
legislative
history
doesn't
have
somebody
saying
look,
this
year,
1977,
we
want
the
phrase
when
appropriate,
which
we're
going
to
continue
for
307
cases,
to
mean
that
even
losers
get
fees.
they
didn't
say
that.
that's
true.
but
here's
what
they
did
say.
the
house
and
the
senate
were
aware
that
the
first
circuit
had
reasoned
that
in
a
case,
which
as
the
government
fairly
points
out,
there
the
environmental
groups
were
not
total
losers,
in
the
old
fashioned
tort
contract--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--yes.
but
the
rationale
of
judge
campbell
seems
to
us
to
be
very
clear
and
seems,
more
importantly
than
to
us,
to
the
congress
to
have
indicated,
as
judge
campbell
pointed
out,
that
there
should
be
an
encouragement
for
citizen
suits
in
this
complex
field
where
people
just
don't
have
the
money
or
the
competence
or
the
expertise
to,
you
know,
just
sort
of
come
in
and
do
it
easily.
this
is
a
case
where
not
any
doubt,
i
think,
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
not
to
reward
counsel
in
the
sense
of
giving
restitution
to
counsel
or
their
clients,
such
as
the
sierra
club
or
edf,
but
to
encourage
them
to
come
in
and
speak
their
piece
in
judicial
review
proceedings.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
there
is
language
in
the
legislative
history,
concededly,
if
i
were
standing
here
today
and
had
a
chance
to
rewrite
what
was
said,
i'd
have
it
a
lot
clearer,
i
agree.
but
there's
a
number
of
strands
of
evidence,
if
you
will,
justice
rehnquist,
indicating
the
congress
understood
quite
clearly
that
this
isn't
a
simplistic
situation,
like
the
government
argues.
the
results
didn't
clean
our
air
in
a
measurable
sense,
ergo,
nobody
gets
counsel
fees.
i
don't
really
think
the
government
means
to
argue
that
ultimately.
the
point
is,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest,
as
congress
saw
it,
to
permit
judicial
review
of
rulemaking
on
a
timely
basis,
a
60-day
statute
of
limitations,
and
they
encourage
private
individuals
and
institutions
with
lawyers
to
come
in
and
do
this
and
to
even
get
paid
when
they
lost.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
case,
saw
that
point,
as
did
the
first
circuit.
congress
saw
the
point.
you
see,
the
government
keeps
trying
to
tie
us
in
to
the
legislative
history
of
304
in
1970.
there's
a
good
reason
for
that.
they
don't
want
to
see
anything
develop
to
indicate
and
anticipate
and
take
care
of
what
happened
in
the
year
1977.
they
want
to
treat
this
as
if
it's
an
old
fashioned,
simple
litigation,
or
even
a
fairly
modern,
simple
litigation,
like
an
abatement
case.
of
course
this
isn't
an
abatement
case.
they
also
suggest
that
private
parties
could
be
defendants.
section
307
suits,
i'm
sure
ms.
oberly
misspoke.
she
knows
that
you
cannot
be
a
defendant
if
you're
a
private
party
in
a
307
petition
for
review
unless
you
are
brought
in
as
an
intervenor.
so
that,
conceding
that
the
history
is
not
clear,
as
either
the
government
would
like
or
the
respondents
would
like,
we
argue
the
balance
tips
in
favor
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
case.
now,
the
government
also
likes
to
downplay
this
case
and
say,
well
you
know,
there
really
weren't
that
much
happened.
it
began,
all
in
'79,
it
was
routine.
it's
a
little
more
than
that.
back
in
1973,
groups
out
in
the
west
began
to
be
concerned
about
emissions
of
sulphur
dioxide,
particularly
in
the
western
coal-fired
utility
plants.
it
is
true,
as
the
government
says,
that
in
1975
was
really
the
formal
kickoff,
but
there's
been
a
long
and
tortuous
history,
not
only
under
the
banner
or
case
name
of
the
case
that
we're
here
before
you
this
morning,
but
in
a
case
before
judge
skelly
wright
in
1975,
as
i
recall,
brought
by
some
of
the
indian
tribes,
raising
this
issue.
we're
talking
in
this
case
about
an
issue
that
engendered
a
simply
enormous,
complex
record.
it's
also
a
little
bit
disingenuous,
it
seems
to
me,
to
argue
that
these
people
who
came
in
here
for
the
sierra
club,
particularly
in
terms
of
the
merits
issues
and
then
later
edf,
in
terms
of
the
administrative
law
issues
which
were
settled
in
this
case,
to
say
that
nobody
won
anything.
obviously
there
was
the
win
in
the
sense
that
the
public,
in
the
broad
sense,
had
somebody
coming
in
to
petition
for
review
where
you
had
a
brand
new
section
111
of
the
1977
act
dealing
with
standards
for
emissions
of
sulphur
dioxide.
and
one
of
the
great
issues
that
was
resolved
here,
and
it
wasn't
an
easy
issue,
and
the
court,
contrary
to
the
government's
position,
said
it
wasn't
an
easy
issue,
and
that
was
the
variable
standards,
west
as
opposed
to
east,
for
emissions
of
coal-fired
utility
smokestacks.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
your
honor,
as
an
ex-bureaucrat
i'd
like
to
admit
that
there
is
some
grounds
for
thinking
that
the
government
possibly
reaches
the
same
result
without
citizen
intervention.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
the
point
is
that
congress
has
said,
though,
there
should
be
citizen
intervention.
we
really
don't
know.
it
is
true,
as
ms.
oberly
says,
that
the
court
sided
with
epa.
we
have
to
concede
that.
but
here
we
have
a
12,000
page
record,
briefs,
papers,
7,000,
so
on.
as
you
know
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
they
had
a
very
lengthy
one.
this
wasn't
as
easy
as
the
government
suggests.
now
who
can
do
a
better
job
about
complex
issues
than
this
than
organizations
such
as
these
respondents?
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
ah.
we
argue,
mr.
justice
white,
that
congress
contemplated
that.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
this
is
not
a
statute
designed
to
restore
and
look
back
and
say
we
only
reward
winners.
this
is
a
statute
which
as
a
policy
matter,
congress
said,
look,
the
best
way
to
encourage
judicial
review
is
to
say
we'll
even
pay
losers
in
appropriate
circumstances.
incidently,
there's
an
excellent
law
review
which
came
out.
i
say
it's
excellent,
concededly,
because
it
supports
our
rationale,
but
i
think
it's
better
than
that.
it
goes
into
this
a
bit.
it's
a
note
which
appears
at
96
harvard
law
review,
beginning
at
page
677.
i
don't
think
anybody
had
a
chance
by
the
time
the
briefs
were
in
to
include
it.
but
i
point
it
out
to
the
court
because
it
deals
with
this
issue,
justice
white.
we
say
that
this
is
a
statute
which
you
have
to
approach
a
little
different
than
typical
american
fee
shifting
statutes.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
different
in
the
sense
that
it
isn't
the
frequent
thing.
but
this
isn't
the
first
time
that
a
loser
has
ever
been
awarded
fees
in
american
federal
court.
take
a
very
simple
situation,
old
chapter
10
reorganizations.
many
people
get
fees
in
those
proceedings
and
they
don't
win
anything.
supposing
you're
representing
an
indenture
holder,
a
bond.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
you
don't
win
anything.
you
don't
win,
i
dare
say.
at
least,
in
the
classic,
technical
sense.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
ah.
true.
that
is
a
distinction.
we
do
not
have,
of
course,
the
classic
fund
situation.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
fine.
but
think
again
about
how
we
award,
true,
by
statute,
fee
out,
if
you
will,
the
legislature
fees
to
lawyers
who
represent
defendants
in
criminal
cases
and,
you
know,
in
certain
circuits
it's
very
hard
to
win
a
criminal
case
at
all
and
the
united
states
pays
the
lawyers.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
right.
and
we
argue
that
here
the
purpose
is
to
provide
the
congress...
the
american
people,
but
purports
in
the
limited
sense
we
are
dealing
with
here,
somebody
to
come
in
and
speak
for
the
environmental
interests.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
admittedly,
it's
clearer
language.
i
have
to
concede
that,
but
if
you
analyze
the
interplay
between
what
happened
in
1970,
particularly
in
courts,
then
what
happened
in
the
congress,
in
such
evidence
as
we
have...
obviously
both
ms.
oberly
and
i
both
would
agree
we'd
like,
from
our
respective
points
of
view,
to
have
clearer
statements,
but
we
say
the
only
fair
construction
is
that
congress
wanted
to
encourage
this
type
of
litigation
and
recognized
that
the
way
to
do
it
was
to
hold
out
that
in
certain
cases,
not
all,
even
if
you
lost,
you'd
get
paid.
now
let
me
add
to
that
something
which
i
think
is
important.
the
government
may
be
arguing,
among
others,
that
it
is
poor
policy
to
encourage
suits
by
paying
losers.
now,
of
course,
none
of
us,
i
assume,
certainly
in
our
briefs
we
don't
have
any
studies
to
show
whether
this
is
true
or
not,
but
let
me
say
that
i
think
that
congress
was
aware
in
1977,
and
indeed
even
back
in
'70,
that
you'll
get
frivolous
lawsuits
no
matter
what
you
do.
and
my
answer
to
that
is,
look,
if
judges
can't
smell
out
frivolous
lawsuits,
i
will
be
surprised.
so
that
the
next
step
to
go
with,
and
i
think
the
government
may
be
trying
to
say
this
is,
that
if
you
have
a
statute
permitting
payment
of
losers,
you
may
get
more
frivolous
lawsuits.
i
don't
believe
that's
true
and
i
think
human
experience
proves
it's
not
true.
it's
better
to
encourage,
particularly
citizens
and
groups
who
know
something
about
environmental
problems,
to
come
in
and
petition
for
review
and
get
payment,
in
appropriate
cases
only,
where
they
lose,
than
to
discourage
them
totally
so
that
they
won't
even
bring
petitions.
and
finally,
let
me
make
another
point
here.
the
government
says,
with
some
plausible
record
basis
for
it,
that
the
problem
is
that
congress
didn't
flesh
out
the
words
where
or
when
appropriate
and
that,
of
course,
is
literally
true.
but
our
argument
on
that
is
understandable
to
you
all,
i'm
sure,
and
it
is
simply
that
courts
have
long,
whether
federal,
state
or
local
on
whatever
issue,
been
able
to
exercise
discretion
with
even
less
precision
than
this.
and
a
good
example
is
the
cases
here
in
this
circuit,
which,
of
course,
is
where
you're
going
to
get
most
of
the
cases.
following
our
case,
there
was
on
the
same
day,
an
eloquent
dissent
by
judge
wilkey
in
alabama
power
in
which
he
said
that
when
appropriate
was
very
vague
and
it
put
the
court
in
the
political
thicket
and
so
on
and
so
on.
time
passes
and
in
a
case
which
sometimes
lawyers
refer
to
as
north
slope
v.
andrus,
or
as
in
our
briefs
is
called,
village
of
kaktovik
v.
watt,
judge
wilkey
himself
accurately
summed
up
the
holding
of
the
panel
in
this
case,
applied
those
rules,
if
you
will,
or
those
criteria;
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
that
case
the
losers
did
not
deserve
to
win,
parsing
out
all
of
the
criteria
that
would
make
sense
to
any
judge
or
court
that
ever
has
fixed
fees
on
any
basis.
therefore,
we
sum
up
and
say
to
your
honors
that
this
is
a
case
where
congress
clearly
intended
to
say
under
the
appropriate
circumstances,
subject
to
the
sound
discretion
of
the
fee
fixing
panel
or
court,
there
can
be
fees
paid
in
these
environmental
cases,
even
where
there
has
been
a
technical
loss
on
petitions
for
judicial
review.
thank
you,
very
much.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
not
entirely,
because
there--
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
--the
language
is
not
different,
but
i
would
answer
you
and
admit
that
i
would
argue
differently
because
i
think
there
a
court
would
apply
its
discretion
differently.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
well,
i
can
see
the
argument.
mr.
harold
r.
tyler,
jr.
i
would,
if
i
were
exercising
the
discretion,
concededly
not
award
fees
if
i
were
the
panel.
i
admit
that.
but
i
would
answer,
though,
that
this
could
be
done
and,
indeed,
already
has
been
done,
even
in
a
307
environment.
that
really,
to
me,
seems
to
be
the
point
of
village
of
kaktovik
under
the
same
language.
but
certainly,
taking
the
case
you
quote,
i
would
have
to
concede
i'd
come
out
differently,
but
i
would
urge
that
it
matters
