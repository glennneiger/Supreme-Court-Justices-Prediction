mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
represent
the
state
of
nevada,
and
i
will
be
followed
by
mr.
girard,
representing
the
truckee-carson
irrigation
district,
or
tcid.
this
is
a
preclusion
case.
the
basic
issue
is
to
what
extent
the
united
states
and
the
paiute
tribe
of
indians
are
barred
by
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
from
seeking
more
water
from
the
truckee
river
in
nevada
for
the
indians'
reservation.
we
say
that
they
are
completely
barred
by
virtue
of
the
final
decree
that
was
rendered
by
the
federal
district
court
in
nevada
in
the
so-called
orr
ditch
case
some
40
years
ago.
now,
orr
ditch
was
no
piecemeal,
interlocutory,
or
open-ended
proceeding.
as
both
of
the
courts
below
found,
this
was
a
comprehensive,
all-inclusive,
quiet
title
water
adjudication.
it
was
begun
in
1913,
with
the
united
states
appearing
on
behalf
of
both
the
tribe,
which
had
been
set
aside...
rather,
the
reservation,
which
had
been
set
aside
in
1859,
and
also
the
newlands
project,
which
is
a
reclamation
project
authorized
by
congress
in
1902.
now,
winters
had
been
decided
five
years
before
this
orr
ditch
case
was
begun,
in
1908,
so
that
for
the
reservation,
the
united
states
was
seeking
water
for
the
primary
purpose
of
the
reservation
which
it
deemed
to
be
to
convert
the
indians
from
their
nomadic
habits
into
husbandry
and
agriculture,
and
therefore
to
give
them
water
for
irrigation.
for
newlands,
the
united
states
sought
enough
water
to
irrigate
the
project.
the
case
proceeded
for
some
13
years,
until
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
entered
in
1926
by
the
court
after
a
special
master
had
heard
evidence,
and
the
tro
acted
as
a
kind
of
a
trial
balloon.
would
the
tro
work?
was
it
feasible?
and
this
test
period
lasted
for
18
years,
until
finally,
in
1944,
a
final
decree
was
entered
which
established
the
quantification
for
every
claimant
to
this
river.
it
applied
then
and
for
the
future.
it
prohibited
every
claimant
from
ever
again
seeking
water
of
the
truckee.
it
contained
no
reopening
provisions.
as
for
the
indians,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
government
placed
in
issue
the
reservation
cause
of
action.
and
now
what
do
we
find?
twenty-nine
years
later,
the
government
brought
this
action
seeking
additional
water
on
behalf
of
the
tribe.
the
ninth
circuit
made
two
holdings.
first
of
all,
it
held
that
res
judicata
prevented
this
suit
insofar
as
the
orr
ditch
defendants
were
concerned.
in
other
words,
even
if
the
united
states
should
not
have
represented
both
the
reservation
and
the
project,
which
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
decide,
the
orr
ditch
defendants
were
not
aware
of
any
impropriety,
and
consequently
res
judicata
applied.
we
believe
that
that
ruling
is
clearly
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
orr
ditch
defendants
were
some
744
claimants
to
the
truckee
river,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct,
of
varying
priorities.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
these
claimants,
your
honor,
i
think
eight
of
them
actually
proceeded
the
reservation
claims,
and
most
of
them
came
between
then
and
1902,
and
some
came
after
1902.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
the
court
also
made
a
second
ruling,
however,
and
this
was
two
to
one,
with
judge
schroeder
dissenting,
namely,
that
the
united
states
could
take
water
for
the
tribe
from
the
newlands
project
farmers
because
in
orr
ditch,
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
there
was
no
adversity
under
the
pleadings
insofar
as
the
newlands
farmers
were
concerned.
now,
the
first
point
i
would
like
to
make,
and
incidentally,
we
obviously
regard
that
ruling
as
an
error.
we
think
res
judicata
applies
across
the
board.
the
first
point
is
that
there
was
nothing
improper
about
the
government
representation
in
orr
ditch.
in
these
types
of
case,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
the
government
often
has
to
represent
diverse
interests.
it
may
be
reservations.
it
may
be
reclamation
projects,
national
forests,
naval
bases,
and
so
forth.
and
this
court
said
as
much
last
month
in
arizona
versus
california,
when
it
approved
heckman.
heckman,
incidentally,
had
been
decided
only
one
year
before
orr
ditch
began.
there
was
certainly
nothing
improper
perceived
at
the
time
of
orr
ditch
by
the
government's
representation.
it
thought
that
it
was
proceeding
quite
properly,
and
very
actively,
on
behalf
of
both
the
project
and
on
behalf
of
the
reservation.
moreover,
the
government's
good
faith
representation
is
shown
by
two
factors
here.
first
of
all,
between
the
tro
and
the
final
decree,
the
government
actually
obtained
more
water
for
the
indians
than
had
been
prescribed
in
the
tro.
they
increased
the
amount
that
the
indians
were
going
to
get.
and
secondly,
in
the
walker
river
case,
walker
river
reservation
having
been
established
by
the
same
documents...
the
same
indians,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
were
involved...
there
was
no
project,
no
competing
project,
and
the
government
still
did
not
seek
a
fishery
right
in
the
walker
river
case.
so,
obviously,
it
was
not
acting
because
of
any
conflict
in
our
case.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
no
discrete
fishery
right
was
sought
in
orr
ditch.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
not
at
all.
we
concede
that
a
discrete
fishery
right
was
not
sought
as
part
of
the
decree
in
orr
ditch.
now,
the
reason
i
use
the
word
"discrete"
is
that
the
united
states
sought
a
full
winters
right
for
the
reservation,
but
it
was
seeking
it
primarily
for
irrigation,
which
it
perceived
to
be
the
primary
purpose
of
the
reservation.
so,
it
also...
domestic
water
and
a
small
amount
of
water
for
fishery
undoubtedly
was
thought
about,
but
you
have
to
understand,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
that
unlike
today,
where
the
government
is
seeking
a
tremendous
amount
of
water
to
maintain
the
level
of
the
lake,
back
in
orr
ditch,
when
they
were
thinking
about
a
fishery
right,
they
were
thinking
about
a
very
small
amount
of
water
simply
to
allow
the
fish
to
get
upstream
to
spawn.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
that
is
very
interesting,
mr.
justice.
the
lake
went
down
rather
dramatically
in
the
forties
and
fifties,
but
it
has
been
stabilized
since.
you
will
find
a
finding
by
the
district
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
agree,
that
the
lake
has
been
stabilized,
and
our
studies
show
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
been
stabilized
since
1960,
and
on
top
of
that,
we
have
$32
million
spent
by
the
government
to
add
to
the
fishery,
and
of
course
the
tribe
also
gained
$8
million
in
the...
before
the
indians
claim
commission
because
of
their
lost
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
the
indians
claim
commission
decision
is
a
rather
interesting
one,
because
the
united
states
and
the
indians
entered
into
a
kind
of
a
deal
where
they
said,
well,
since
no
fishery
right
could
be
extinguished,
this
could
not
be
for
the
extinguishment
of
the
fishery
right.
on
the
other
hand,
it--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--that's
correct,
and
it
was
for
a
reserved
right
lost
in
the
past,
so
the
only
reserved
right
that
i
know
that
they
supposedly
lost
was
for
fisheries,
so
i
am
not
sure
that
we
can
say
that
that
was
not
for
a
lost
fishery
right.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
adversity
under
the
pleading.
we
claim,
of
course,
that
you
do
not
need
it
in
an
all-inclusive
water
rights
litigation.
every
claimant
is
adverse
to
every
other
claimant
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
a
quiet
title
adjudication.
however,
in
this
case,
we
have
something
in
addition.
if
the
court
will
address
itself
to
the
appendix
that
we
have
filed
with
our
reply
brief,
we
summarize
the
parties
in
the
tro
and
in
the
final
decree,
and
what
you
will
find
is
that
while
the
united
states
is
listed
as
a
plaintiff,
the
united
states
is
also
listed
as
a
defendant,
and
under
the
defendant
united
states
in
brackets
is
listed
what,
the
newland
project
and
the
reservation.
so,
the
court
and
the
parties
which
agreed
to
the
stipulated
final
decree
were
obviously
interested
in
showing
that
the
rights
of
the
newlands
project
and
of
the
reservation
were
indeed
being
adjudicated
inter
se,
and
it
was
putting
everybody
on
notice
that
that
was
what
was
happening,
and
that
is
the
only
purpose
of
adversity
under
the
pleadings,
to
give
an
opportunity
to
litigate,
and
to
put
everyone
on
notice
that
rights
are
being
adjudicated
inter
se.
there
was
not
only
an
opportunity
to
litigate
here,
but
there
was
full
litigation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
tribe
sign
what?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
you
mean
the
orr
ditch
decree?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
were
represented
by
the
united
states.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
they
were
fully
represented
by
the
united
states.
i
would
like
to
close
and
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
with
just
one
point.
i
would
like
to
ask
this
court
a
very
simple,
practical
question.
would
hundreds
of
orr
ditch
defendants
have
worked
for
some
31
years
in
this
case,
litigated,
and
then
consented
to
a
final
decree,
would
the
newlands
project
ever
have
been
built,
would
the
district
court
have
signed
that
decree,
would
western
nevada,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
been
built
on
the
basis
of
that
final
decree
if
they
had
known
at
the
time
that
there
was
outstanding
some
secret,
unresolved
claim
for
four-fifths
of
the
water
of
this
river
which
could
be
litigated
20
years
hence,
40
years
hence,
100
years
hence,
and
which
could
totally
destroy
the
newlands
project?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
government
is
seeking,
your
honor,
approximately...
between
375,000
and
400,000
acre
feet
of
water.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
it
would
be
on
the
average,
obviously,
your
honor.
but
what
that
would
do
would
be
to
take
at
least
half
the
water
that
is
now
going
to
newlands
and
divert
it,
and
of
course
they
would
have
an
1859
priority
for
the
entire
400,000.
there
are
only
500,000
acre
feet
in
the
entire
river.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
just
a
few
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
pelcyger
said
that
the
united
states
couldn't
be
adverse
to
itself.
the
united
states
was
adverse
to
itself,
named
as
party,
both
plaintiff
and
defendant,
and
is
in
this
very
case...
it
is
seeking
runoff
water
for
the
stillwater
refuge
in
this
case,
and
stillwater
is
located
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
newlands
project.
if
they
win
in
this
case,
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
runoff
water
for
the
very
interests
that
they
are
seeking
it
for
in
this
case.
i
would
simply
say
in
regard
to
mr.
kneedler's
main
point,
if
he
can
take
this
water
and
do
with
it
as
he
pleases,
one
wonders
why
the
district
court
quantified
the
newlands
right
down
to
the
last
acre
foot,
not
only
in
terms
of
the
total
amount
of
acre
feet
that
we've
got,
but
3.5
and
4.5
acre
feet
per
acre
for
newlands
specifically.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
derby
dam,
your
honor,
is...
after
it
leaves
what
we
call
the
meadows--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--which
is
where
most
of
the
farmers
are
located
other
than
newlands,
it
goes
down
the
river.
it
then
splits
at
derby
dam,
and
half
of
it
goes
off
to
the
left,
to
pyramid,
and
the
other
half
goes
off
down
to
newlands.
stillwater
is
on
the
far
side
of
the
newlands
project.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
dam
is
at
the
split.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
you--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
one
of
the
interesting
things
i
wanted
to
point
out
when
they
talked
about
an
alleged
conflict
before.
when
it
was
originally
contemplated
in
the
1904
act,
when
they
talked
about...
remember,
there
was
some
talk
about
the
larger
purposes
of
reclamation?
what
was
contemplated
at
that
time
under
the
1904
act
was
that
the
reservation
was
going
to
be
irrigated
out
of
newlands.
they
thought
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
canal
built
from
newlands
so
that
the
reservation
was
going
to
get...
was
going
to
be
irrigated.
that's
what
they
meant
by
the
larger
interest
of
reclamation.
they
were
including
newlands
in
that.
they
weren't
just
talking
about
newlands.
they
were
talking
about
the
reservation.
unless
there
are
questions,
your
honor,
i
have
nothing
further.
