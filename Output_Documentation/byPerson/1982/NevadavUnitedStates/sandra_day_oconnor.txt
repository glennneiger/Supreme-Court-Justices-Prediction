tcid
bound
by
whatever
knowledge

in
connection
with
the

tcid
basically
in
privy
with
the
united
states
in
legal
terms
in
this
case?
justice

right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
any
response
to
the
assertion
by
nevada
that
there
was
formal
adversity
in
the
1926
tro
and
in
the
final
decree,
as
they
pointed
out
in
the
reply
brief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
aren't
all
water
rights
appurtenant
to
land?
i
mean,
it
is
just
an
amount
of
water
that
attaches
to
certain
land.
that's
all.
