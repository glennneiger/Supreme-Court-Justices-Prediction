what
i
wanted...
you
mentioned
that

the
finding
doesn't
quite
say
that
they
would
have
asked
for
more
water
if
they
weren't
acting
in
both
capacities,
though.
or
do
you
think
that
is
the
correct
reading
of
it?
justice

well,
is
there
any
evidence
other
than...
taken
apart
from
the
finding,
what
is
the
evidence
that
the
government
would
have
sought
more
water
on
behalf
of
the
indians
had
they
not
represented
the
other
group?
