mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
pyramid
lake
reservation
was
established
in
1859
for
the
pyramid
lake
paiute
tribe
of
indians,
whose
name
for
themselves
is
cui-ui
dicato,
cui-ui
eaters.
contemporaneous
documents
show
that
the
government's
intent
was
to
include
pyramid
lake
and
its
"large
fisheries"
in
the
reservation,
and
that
such
a
reservation
would
have
the
advantage
of
being
the
paiute's
home
from
choice.
both
lower
courts
expressly
found
that
one
of
the
reservation's
purposes
was
to
provide
indians
with
access
to
their
historic
fisheries.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes,
sir,
it
was
their
historic
home.
it
was...
it
had
the
advantage
of
being
their
home
from
choice.
they
were
the
cui-ui
decato,
where
the
cui-ui
are
found
no
place
else
in
the
world
except
at
pyramid
lake.
water
from
the
truckee
river
was
and
continues
to
be
necessary
to
fulfill
this
purpose
in
two
respects,
to
maintain
the
level
of
the
lake
and
for
sufficient
water
in
the
river
to
sustain
natural
reproduction
of
the
fish.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
the
lake...
the
salinity
level
of
the
lake
is
5,500
parts
per
million,
which
compares
to
the
ocean,
for
example,
of
35,000
parts
per
million
of
total
dissolved
solids,
so
it
is
about
one-seventh
as...
less
salty
than
the
ocean,
but
compared
to
the
river,
the
river
is
only,
say,
250
parts
per
million
or
500
parts
per
million,
so
it
is
much
saltier
than
the
ocean,
and
the
fish--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--there
is
no
outlet,
but
the
fish
need
the
fresh
water
to
spawn
in.
they
live
most
of
their
lives
in
the
lake,
but
they
ascend
the
river
to
spawn.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
they
can
get
up
now.
congress
authorized
and
the
interior
department
built
a
fishway
in
1976.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes,
they
are,
and
last
year
there
were
15,000
fish
that
ascended
that
fishway
to
spawn.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
and
returned.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
no,
there
is
an
interesting
biological
question
that
biologists
like
to
debate
about.
spawn
from
the...
the
lahontan
cutthroat
trout,
first
let
me
say,
are
being
restocked
in
the
lake
through
hatcheries.
there
is
no
real
natural
reproduction
of
trout
because
they
can't
get
above
derby
dam
to
spawn.
the
cui-ui
are
naturally
reproducing.
the
trout
are
not.
but
the
trout
through
two
tribal
hatcheries,
a
federal
hatchery,
are
being...
are
being
stocked
in
the
lake,
and
there
is
a
decent
sportsmen's
fishery
there
which
brings
in
most
of
the
money
that
the
tribe
exists
on.
there's
an
obscure
biologists'
question
that
they
like
to
debate
about
whether
the
original...
the
trout
were
destroyed
in
1940.
they
ceased
to
exist
in
the
lake.
but--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--no,
because
they
couldn't
get
out
of
the
lake--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--the
obscure
question
is
whether
the
eggs
that
were
taken
from
the
pyramid
lake,
lahontan
cutthroat
trout,
and
were
deposited
all
over
the
western
united
states
prior
to
1940,
whether
that
gene
pool
still
exists
in
these
other
places
and
are
now
being
restored
to
the
lake
by
getting
eggs
from
those
fish.
and
in
fact
there
was
an
article
in
sports
illustrated
about
three
or
four
years
ago
where
a
biologist
claimed
that
the
original
trout
was
relocated
in
a
small
stream
in
utah.
but
in
any
event,
the
species
itself
exists
and
exists
in
pyramid
lake
today.
let
me
say
also
there
was
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
record
in
this
case
to
suggest
that
the
government
did
not
assert
a
water
right
for
fishery
purposes
in
the
orr
ditch
case
because
the
fishery
was
not
deemed
to
be
a
primary
purpose
of
the
reservation.
the
federal
court
in
the
sturgeon
case
in
1879,
which
was
a
trespass
case
brought
by
the
united
states
to
prosecute
non-indian
fishermen
at
pyramid
lake
specifically
held
that
the
principal
purpose
of
the
lake
was
the
fishery,
and
without
the
fishery
there
was
nothing.
and
congress
in
1956,
when
it
enacted
legislation
to
restore
the
pyramid
lake
fishery,
specifically
said
the
fishery
at
pyramid
lake
was
once
world
famous.
the
trout
there
got
to
be
41
pounds
at
one
point.
the
world
record
for
the
species
was
caught
at
pyramid
lake.
and
that
restoration
of
the
pyramid
lake
fishery
is
deemed,
to
its
full
potential
value,
is
deemed
to
be
of
national
interest
and
importance.
now,
of
course,
the
trout
is--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--the
trout.
the
white
people
never
developed
a
taste
for
cui-ui.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
the
trout
is
now
an
endangered
species...
i'm
sorry,
the
trout
is
now
a
threatened
species.
the
cui-ui
is
endangered.
the
cui-ui,
in
fact,
is
the
only
remaining
pure
species
left
in
its
genis,
and
so
the
species
is
in
jeopardy
of
extension,
but
the
cui-ui--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i
can't
speak
to
that,
justice
marshall.
i
don't
know
about
that
information.
the
orr
ditch
litigation
was
a
travesty.
the
judge
who
entered
the
decree
was
formerly
a
lawyer
for
the
defendants
in
the
case
who
argued
against
the
existence
of
a
water
right
for
the
fishery.
the
lawyer
who
was
representing
the
government
and
through
the
government
the
indians
when
the
final
decree
was
entered
had
formerly
been
the
lawyer
for
the
truckee-carson
irrigation
district
and
for
a
group
of
water
users
on
the
project.
the
united
states--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--yes,
your
honor.
there
couldn't
be
any
formal
adversity
because
both
the
newlands
project
and
the
united
states
were
represented
by
the
same
party,
the
united
states.
the
united
states
couldn't
be
adverse
to
itself.
the
same
attorneys
were
representing
the
indians'
interests
and
the
interests
of
the
newlands
project.
adversity
is
incomprehensible
in
those
circumstances.
what
nevada
pointed
out
in
its
reply
brief
is
that
the
caption
of
the
case
was
in
the
nature
of
an
index,
and
the
caption
of
the
case
told
you
where
to
go
to
find
out
the
rights
of
the
newlands
project,
the
rights
of
the
indians,
but
it
didn't
and
it
couldn't
have
conceivably
adjudicated
those
rights.
in
fact,
it
wouldn't
even
have
been
a
justiciable
issue,
because
the
united
states
couldn't
litigate
against
itself.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
but
you
need
justiciability.
you
certainly
need
justiciability.
and
how--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--well,
justiciability
is
a
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
and
the
issue
here,
the
reason
that
justiciability
is
important
relates
to
the
identity
of
claims
issue
of
res
judicata,
because
there
is
no
question
that
the
fishery
water
right
was
not
actually
litigated
in
orr
ditch.
the
only
question
that
this
court
has
to
face
on--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--it's
not
just
an
argument.
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
fishery
needed
water.
there
was
no--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
that.
the
government
made
a
conscious,
deliberate
decision,
and
the
record
shows,
and
the
district
court
found
that
it
made
that
decision
because
the
fishery
right
conflicted
with
the
right
for
the
newlands
project.
there
wasn't
enough
water
for
both
purposes.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
who
had
an
interest
in
the
newlands
water
right?
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
the
united
states
and
the
project
farmers,
and
tcid.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
were
they
adverse
to
it?
did
they
oppose
it?
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
there
is
no
question
but
that
there
was
a
conflict.
there
was
competition
between
those
two
interests.
but
there
was
no
adversity
in
the
legal
sense
within
the
confines
of
the
orr
ditch
case
because
the--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i
am
not
suggesting
that.
i
am
not
sure
that
the...
i
don't
think
the
united
states
is
suggesting
that.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
no,
i
think
the
point
of
the
united
states
is
that...
and
i
will
let
them
speak
for
themselves...
that--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--okay.
is
that
the
right
of
the
projects
is
derivative
through...
the
project
users
is
derivative
by
contract,
and
if
that
contract
is
breached,
their
remedy
is
for
breach
of
contract,
but
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
decree
that...
this
is
a
res
judicata
case...
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
decree
that
prevents
the
government
from
doing
what
it
does.
i
would
like
for
a
second,
if
i
could,
to
get
back
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
justiciability.
this
court
must
find,
to
uphold
res
judicata,
that
the
fishery
water
right
should
and
could
have
been
litigated
in
the
orr
ditch
case.
there
is
no
way
that
that
finding
can
be
made
if
the
issue
would
not
even
have
been
justiciable.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
it
was
clearly
distinguished
by
the
government.
the
government
sought
an
irrigation
right
for
the
tribe,
and
it
sought
that
right
precisely
because
there
was
a
determination
by
the
government
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
conflict
between
the
irrigation
right
and
the
fishery
right,
and
that's
why
it
didn't
assert
the
fishery
right.
so,
whether...
i
don't
think
this
case
presents
whether
in
some
other
circumstance
a
winters
doctrine
right
for
fishery
and
irrigation
is
part
of
the
same
right
or
is
different.
the
crucial
factor
here
is
that
the
water
right
for
the
newlands
project
was
consistent
with
the
indians'
irrigation
right
because
it
was
so
small,
but
was
inconsistent
and
deemed
to
be
inconsistent
and
in
conflict
with
the
fishery
water
right.
that's
why
the
fishery
water
right
was
not
asserted.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes,
but
the
land
is
different.
the
irrigable
land
on
the
indian
reservation
is
6,000
acres
of
irrigable
land
to
which
the
irrigation
water
right
is
appurtenant.
the
fishery
water
right
is
appurtenant
to
pyramid
lake
and
to
the
truckee
river,
which
is
within
the
reservation.
there's
different
land
involved.
it's
as
if
there
were
two
different
parcels
of
land
involved
in
a
quiet
title
action.
now,
the
conflict
of
interest,
which
is
the
critical
point
from
the
tribes'
standpoint
in
this
case,
and
which
was
expressly
found
to
exist,
the
district
court
found
not
only
that
the
conflict
exists;
but
that
the
conflict
was
the
reason
that
the
fishery
water
right
was
not
asserted.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that
finding
is...
let
me
quote
it
to
you.
on
page
185-a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
excuse
me?
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes.
it
was
the
intention
of
the
plaintiff,
that
is,
the
united
states,
by
and
through
its
attorneys,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
and
the
bureau
of
reclamation,
to
assert
as
large
a
water
right
as
possible
for
the
indian
reservation
and
to
do
everything
possible
to
protect
the
fish
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
and
the
white
populations
"insofar
as
it
was
consistent
with
the
larger
interests
involved
in
the
proposition
having
to
do
with
the
reclamation
of
thousands
of
acres
of
arid
and
now
useless
land
for
the
benefit
of
the
country
as
a
whole.
"
so,
this
finding
is
a
smoking
gun.
it
shows
not
only
the
existence
of
the
conflict,
but
it
shows
that
it
adversely
affected
the
performance
of
the
government's
lawyers,
and
the
tribe's
primary
submission
is
that
because
of
this
government's
conflict,
the
tribe
was
denied
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
i
think
you
can
safely
say
by
analogy
to
the
criminal
cases,
to
cuyler
against
sullivan
and
wood
against
georgia,
that
it
certainly
shows
that
the
conflict
influenced
the
conduct
of
the
litigation
and
adversely
affected
it
from
the
tribe's
standpoint.
now,
i
think
it
is
impossible
for
any
court
to
make
a
finding
about
what
would
have
happened
if
this
wasn't
there,
but
the
finding
says
that
there
was
actual
prejudice,
and
i
don't
see
for
due
process
purposes
how
you
could
have
anything
more
than
that.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
because
every
time
the
issue
was
brought
up,
and
there
were
specific
recommendations
made
to
assert
the
water
right,
the
reason
that
it
was
not
asserted
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
wasn't
meritorious,
it
wasn't
a
primary
purpose
of
the
reservation.
the
reason
it
was
not
asserted
was
because
of
the
conflict
with
the
newlands
project.
there
is
a
letter
in
the
record
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
page
444,
for
example,
where
the
secretary
of
the
interior
says,
inasmuch
as
there
is
at
nearly
all
times
only
enough
water
for
irrigation
purposes,
it
is
believed
that
it
would
be
most
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
obtain
a
portion
for
fish
life.
and
the
government
attorneys,
the
justice
department
attorneys
specifically
said
the
same
thing.
they
said,
a
congressman
wrote
to
the
attorney
general
and
said,
what
are
you
doing
about
fish
life
in
the
truckee
river?
and
the
justice
department
attorney
answered
by
saying
that
the
fishery
issue
was
completely
outside
the
scope
of
the
orr
ditch
case.
it
was
never
in
the
case.
and
then
he
went
on
to
say,
"inasmuch
as
the"...
and
this
supports
the
justiciability
argument,
justice
rehnquist,
"inasmuch
as
the
government
has
control
of
the
derby
dam,
i
have
always
thought
that
the
reclamation
service
and
the
indian
service,
both
bureaus
of
the
department
of
the
interior,
could
settle
the
matter
between
them
as
to
providing
the
proper
fishways
and
comparatively
small
amount
of
water
which
may
be
needed
to
enable
the
fish
to
pass
up
the
fishways.
"
so,
the
justice
department
knew
that
it
wasn't
an
issue
that
could
and
should
have
been
litigated.
the
justice
department
knew
that
it
had
to
be
settled
administratively
and
couldn't
be
litigated
in
a
case
in
which
the
justice
department
was
representing
both
of
those
bureaus
through
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
thank
you.
my
time
is
up.
