justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
girard,
i
read
ickes
against
fox
as
turning
at
least
in
part
on
the
nature
of
the
washington
system
for
water
rights.
does
nevada
have
a
system
substantially
similar
to
washington's
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nevada
also
argues
that
you
don't
need
adversity,
as
judge
schroeder
felt
in
her
dissent,
in
a
water
litigation,
that
everyone
in
the
case
is
bound,
whether
or
not
they
were
adverse
to
one
another.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
justiciability
a
requirement
of...
kind
of
a
federal
requirement
in
water
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
an...
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
a
fishery
water
right?
i
mean,
the
indians'
claim
of
water
right
under
the
winters
doctrine
was
litigated,
but
the
fact
that
the
government
might
have
left
out
one
argument
for
getting
more
water
doesn't
mean
the
specific
right
wasn't--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--okay,
so
the
government
forgot
to
put
in
some
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
insist
that
the
fishery
water
right
is
some
sort
of
a
separate
kind
of
right
from
the
indian
claim
under
the
winters
doctrine
generally.
i
view
it
just
as
insufficient
evidence
as
to
one
possible
use
that
the
indians--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ickes
against
fox
surely
says
that
the
government
doesn't
get
beneficial
title
to
the
water
that's
adjudicated
in
that
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
who
knows
that
40
years
from
now
you
won't
be
coming
back
to
rewrite
history
again.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
is
there
a
federal
rule
of
res
judicata
that
should
apply
in
this
case,
or
does
it
depend
on
the
law
of
the
state
of
nevada?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
allen
against
mccurry?
there
were
federal
rights
being
asserted
there,
too.
that
was
a
1983
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
was
that.
i
mean,
do
you
know
of
a
case
that
says
there
should
be
a
federal
rule
of
res
judicata
under
these
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
cases
involved
conflicting
claims
to
water
rights
in
western
nevada.
many
people
who
live
east
to
the
mississippi
river
may
not
appreciate
the
importance
of
water
in
the
arid
west.
no
state
east
to
the
mississippi
river
receives
an
average
rainfall
of
less
than
30
inches
a
year.
but
the
part
of
nevada
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
receives
an
average
rainfall
of
only
six
inches
a
year.
in
that
country,
if
you
want
to
grow
any
crop
on
your
land,
you
must
bring
water
to
the
land
by
irrigation.
western
nevada
receives
its
water
largely
from
several
rivers
which
rise
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
sierra
nevada
mountains,
the
boundary
between
california
and
nevada.
they
flow
out
of
the
mountains
and
into
western
nevada
and
end
up
in
lakes
with
no
outlets
or
else
disappearing
into
the
desert
and
places
called
sinks.
the
present
litigation
relates
to
water
rights
on
one
of
these
streams,
the
truckee
river,
which
rises
in
the
high
sierra,
flows
into
and
out
of
lake
tahoe
down
through
reno
and
after
a
course
of
a
120
miles,
it
empties
into
pyramid
lake
which
has
no
outlet.
pyramid
lake
is
widely
considered
the
most
beautiful
desert
lake
in
north
america.
and
at
one
time,
it
had
a
cutthroat
trout
which
grew
to
world
record
size.
in
1859,
the
department
of
the
interior
set
aside
nearly
half
a
million
acres
and
what
is
now
western
nevada
as
a
reservation
for
the
areas
paiute
indians.
the
reservation
includes
pyramid
lake,
the
lower
reaches
of
the
truckee
river
and
the
bottom
lands
alongside
the
lower
truckee.
when
congress
enacted
the
reclamation
act
of
1902,
the
federal
government
was
entrusted
with
the
responsibility
of
assisting
settlers
in
the
west
to
bring
waters
to
those
naturally
arid
lands.
one
of
the
first
reclamation
projects
designated
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
after
the
enactment
of
the
act
of
1902
was
the
so-called
newlands
project,
consisting
of
200,000
acres
in
western
nevada
and
the
neighborhood
of
the
present
town
of
fallon.
this
project
was
designed
to
irrigate
future
firms
in
the
area
with
waters
from
both
the
truckee
and
the
carson
rivers.
in
order
to
settle
claims
to
the
waters
from
this
river
before
the
project
was
fully
operative,
the
government
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
nevada
in
1913,
70
years
ago,
to
quiet
title
to
certain
water
rights.
the
government
claimed
first
on
behalf
of
the
paiute
indians
and
second,
on
behalf
of
itself
for
the
benefit
of
future
settlers
within
the
newlands
irrigation
project.
this
irrigation
known
as
the
orr
ditch
suit
continued
for
more
than
40
years.
but
finally,
in
1944,
a
final
decree
was
entered
specifying
the
water
rights
of
all
interests
involved.
one
of
the
results
of
diverting
the
water
out
of
the
truckee
river
for
irrigation
was
that
the
water
level
in
pyramid
lake
declined
and
thereby
threatened
the
indian
fisheries
in
pyramid
lake.
and
so
in
1973,
the
united
states
filed
a
present
action
in
the
nevada
court
on
behalf
of
the
indians
seeking
to
overturn
in
part
the
results
of
the
court
judgment
which
had
been
entered
nearly
40
--
30
years
before.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
government's
complaint,
finding
that
under
the
well
settled
principle
of
judicial
reports
called
by
the
latin
name
of
res
judicata,
this
so-called
orr
ditch
decree
barred
the
government
in
the
intervener,
paiute
tribe
for
making
a
new
claim
at
this
late
date
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
part
but
held
that
the
earlier
decree
did
not
prevent
the
tribe
from
litigating
its
claim
against
the
settlers
who
are
induced
to
move
into
the
area
by
government
representations
of
project
water.
for
reasons
more
fully
explained
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk's
office,
we
now
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
orr
ditch
decree
concluded
the
controversy
concerning
the
truckee
water
rights
between
the
united
states,
the
tribe,
the
orr
ditch
defendants
and
subsequent
appropriators.
unlike
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
we
also
believe
that
since
the
interests
of
both
the
tribe
and
the
project
landowners
were
separately
advanced
and
litigated
by
the
government
in
orr
ditch,
both
should
be
bound
by
that
decree.
we
reject
the
argument
that
the
government
violated
its
fiduciary
duty
to
the
tribe
by
representing
potentially
conflicting
interests.
the
government
was
simply
doing
what
congress
have
directed
it
to
do.
justice
brennan
while
joined
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
