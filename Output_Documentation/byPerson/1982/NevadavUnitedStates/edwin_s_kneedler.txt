mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
make
something
clear
at
the
outset
of
my
argument.
the
government
is
not
asserting
that
it
owns
the
water
rights
in
this
case
and
that
it
has
a
right
to
reallocate
that
water
willy-nilly
to
any
use
it
might
desire,
to
a
wildlife
refuge,
to
the
mx
missile.
we
are
not
asserting
any
such
right.
the
narrow
question
involved
at
this
interlocutory
stage
of
the
case
is
whether
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
are
absolutely
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata,
from
seeking
to
establish
a
prior
reserved
water
right
for
the
fishery
on
their
reservation.
this
case
does
not
concern
what
rights
the
individual
newlands
project
landowners
might
have
under
the
contracts
that
they
entered
into
with
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
that
might
well
have
made
a
difference,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
is
certainly
a
distinguishing
factor.
i
think
on
the
question
of
res
judicata
it
might
well
be
dispositive.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
several
responses.
first,
the
united
states
is
ordinarily
not
subject
to
specific
performance
for
its
contracts.
what
those
contracts
would
have...
let
me
go
back.
the
issue
in
this
case
essentially
at
this
point,
where
the
tribe
now
is
a
party,
and
the
newlands
project
water
users
now
are
parties,
is
whether
the
claims
asserted
on
behalf
of
each
of
them
are
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
neither
the
tribe
nor
the
individual
water
users
was
a
party
to
the
prior
decree.
but
beyond
that,
the
water
rights
that
each
asserts
now
was
not
adjudicated
in
the
prior
decree.
we
have
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
fishery
right
which
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
on
its
behalf
were
asserting
was
not
involved.
but
getting
to
mr.
justice
white's
point,
the
rights
of
the
individual
project
water
users
were
not
adjudicated
in
orr
ditch.
counsel
for
tcid
concedes
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
the
united
states,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
decree...
the
decree
went--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
decree
itself
went
no
further.
the
decree
did
not
adjudicate
the
rights
that
were
conveyed
by
the
contracts.
the
decree
went
only
so
far
as
awarding
a
diversion
right
to
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
the
right
that
the
project
water
users
are
asserting
is
not
a
right
that
was
adjudicated,
was
recognized
by
the
decree
in
orr
ditch.
it
was
separately
conveyed
by
the
united
states
when
it
entered
into
the
contracts
with
the
individual
water
users.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
contracts
were
entered
into
over
a
period
of
time,
by
the
time
of
the
final
decree.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
virtually
all.
i
don't
know
for
certain,
but
virtually
all.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
terms
of
the
text
of
the
final
decree,
in
fact,
the
answer
is
no.
the
text
of
the
decree--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
for...
i
think
that's
quite
important
for
the
purposes
of
res
judicata,
because
what
we
are
talking
about
under
res
judicata
is
looking
at
the
confines
of
the
decree
and
what
effect
should
be
given
to
the
decree.
the
decree
states,
and
in
fact
the
district
court
in
this
very
case
found
that
the
united
states
appeared
in
a
representative
capacity
on
behalf
of
the
indians,
but
it
did
not
say
that
the
united
states
appeared
in
a
representative
fiduciary
capacity
on
behalf
of
the
individual
project
water
users.
it
said,
in
fact,
that
the
united
states...
the
district
court
in
this
case
specifically
found
the
united
states
sued
in
its
own
capacity,
and
the
water
right
that
was
adjudicated
to
it
was
made
under
the
orr
ditch
decree,
now,
specifically,
and
i
quote,
"under
such
control,
disposal,
and
regulation
as
the
plaintiff
may
make
or
desire.
"
the
plaintiff
being
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
at
this
point,
justice
powell,
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
concede
that
the
united
states
would
be
liable
for
damages.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
certainly
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action
for
either
breach
of
contract
or
for
taking.
there
would
be
a
remedy
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
contracts
that
conveyed
these
water
rights
in
fact
were
breached
in
a
sense
that
the
united
states
should
be
liable
for.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
a
fiduciary
to
the
tribe.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
it
is
quite
firmly
our--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--justice
powell,
i
don't
suggest
that
the
current
circumstances
are
easy
ones.
the
united
states
has
not
lightly
undertaken
this
lawsuit.
and
the
united
states
filed
an
original
action
in
this
court
because
it
perceived
the
substantial
breach.
so
i
do
not
want
to
suggest
that
this
is
something
that
the
united
states
has
undertaken
lightly.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
forecloses
the
tribe.
i
understood
justice
powell
to
be
asking
whether
the
individual
project,
newlands
project
water
users--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
when
we
look
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
justice
powell,
what
we
have
is
a
fishery
water
right
that...
a
use
to
which
the
water
of
the
truckee
was
put
from
time
immemorial
by
the
indians
involved
in
this
suit,
a
use
to
which
it
was
being
put
at
the
time
this
very
case
was
brought,
and
the
district
court's
findings
in
this
case
concur
with
what
mr.
pelcyger
said.
the
district
court's
findings
establish
in
our
view,
unfortunately,
that
the
executive
officials
within
the
interior
department
resolved
the
conflict
of
purposes
with
which
they
were
confronted
against
the
reservation
and
in
favor
of
the
newlands
project,
and
in
addition
to
the
particular
finding
that
mr.
pelcyger
relied
on,
i
would
also
like
to
refer
the
court
to
page
165-a
of
nevada's
appendix
to
nevada's
petition,
where
the
court
says,
"the
united
states
was
squarely
presented.
"
with
a
conflict
of
purposes
that
was
"apparent
and
foreseeable",
deriving
from
the
need
to
satisfy
water
rights
for
the
reservation
and
for
the
project
out
of
a
limited
quantity
of
water.
this
case
is
thus
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
from
what
the
court
had
in
arizona
versus
california.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case,
because
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
said
it
might
well
be
dispositive.
i
think
there
might
be
a
question
as
to
whether
the
tcid
or
the
project
water
users
actively
participated
other
than
being
a
nominal
party.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
there
is
no
need
to
disturb
the
water
rights
of
the
defendants
who
were
sued
in
orr
ditch.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
well,
we
think
there
are
several
factors
going
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
is
that
the
judgment
in
orr
ditch
should
not
be
read
to
have
conclusively
decided
all
causes
of
action
between
the
tribe
and
tcid,
because
of
the
lack
of
setting
up
those
claims
in
an
adverse
sense.
what
i
have
explained
here
is
why
the
terms
of
the
orr
ditch
decree
in
fact
established
that;
that
they
did
not
adjudicate
either
the
individual
water
rights
that
are
being
asserted
in
this
case
or
the
tribe's
water
rights
that
are
asserted
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
when
the
two
persons
interested
were
not
even
parties,
and
the
rights
they
are
now
asserting
in
the
case
were
not
even
litigated
in
that
case,
that
res
judicata
does
not
apply,
and
that
was
basically
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals.
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
rely--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
justice
white,
that
is
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
may
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
that
may
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
are
not...
as
i
said,
we
are
not
asserting
the
right
to
do
this
on
the
basis
of
a
right
to
reallocate.
all
we
are...
what...
the
argument--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
what...
our--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
and
perhaps
i
didn't
express
myself
very
well
there.
let
me
try
again.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
the
decree
went
no
further
than
to
adjudicate
the
rights
of
the
united
states,
a
right
of
diversion
in
the
united
states--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
reallocation
point,
though,
we
relied
upon
to
reinforce
the
conclusion
that
the
decree
didn't
go
further,
that
the
private
defendants
in
the
lawsuit
are
permitted
to
reallocate
their
water.
the
decree
did
not
forever
prohibit
them
from
diverting
the
water
to
another
use.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we...
it
may
well
be
that
the
united
states
could
go
further
and
without
any...
and
do--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
may
be,
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
that
far
in
this
case,
because
all
this
case
involves
is
the
question
of
res
judicata,
which
depends
on
the
decree.
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
whether
we
defend
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
and
we
do.
the
court
drew
on
the
principle
now
set
forth
in
section
38
of
the
restatement
of
judgments
relying
on
adversity
under
the
pleadings.
whatever
one's
view
of
whether
that
rule
is
sensible
or
not
sensible,
and
the
fact
that
the
restatement
has
reinvoked
it
suggests
that
it
is
of
continuing
vitality,
but
the
important
point
for
this
case
is
that
the
question
of
res
judicata
goes
to
the
effect
of
the
orr
ditch
decree.
what
we
have
in
the
orr
ditch
decree
is
a
specific
focusing
on...
or
in
the
orr
ditch
litigation,
a
specific
focusing
on
the
problem
of
a
need
for
adversity
under
the
pleadings.
the
district
court
in
orr
ditch
itself
took
measures
to
assure
adversity
among
the
defendants,
but
did
not
do
that
among
the
interests
represented
by
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
would
submit
that
there
would
be
a
federal
rule
of
res
judicata
because
the
rights
being
asserted
here
were
federal
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
this
is
a
suit
brought
in
federal
court,
though,
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--offhand
i
do
not,
but
i
would
think
ordinarily
that
the...
there
might
be
a
separate
question
of
whether
federal
law
would
adopt
state
law,
but
ordinarily
i
would
think
in
a
federal
suit
brought
by
the
united
states
to
declare
federal
water
rights
that
there
would
be
a
federal
rule
of
res
judicata.
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
district
court
in
this
very
case
as
distinguished
from
assuring
adversity
on
the
pleadings
among
the
defendants
did
not
do
that
for
the
respective
rights
being
asserted
in
this
case
to
assure
some
way
in
which
those
rights
would
be
met
in
a
square
conflict.
now,
i
wanted
to
lastly
address
one
point
that
justice
o'connor
asked
about,
whether
tcid
and
the
project
water
users
that
they
represent
should
be
charged
with
the
actions
or
knowledge
of
the
united
states.
i
think
there
is
considerable
force
to
that
point
that
when
parties
take
through
another
party
to
a
lawsuit,
to
some
extent
they
must
be
charged
with
the
acts
of
that
party,
but
there
is
more
here.
here
we
have
tcid
on
behalf
of
the
project
water
users
affirmatively
opposing
the
assertion
of
water
rights
by
the
united
states,
seeking
to
expand
the
water
right
for
irrigation
purposes,
even,
putting
to
one
side
the
fishery
right
which
tcid
opposed
even
releasing
water
for
two
weeks
in
1925
or
1926,
i
think
it
was,
for
the
fishery.
here
we
have
tcid
vigorously
opposing
the
assertion
of
rights
by
the
united
states.
therefore,
it
is
not
just
the
circumstances,
but
it
was
brought
vividly
to
tcid's
attention
that
the
united
states
had
conflicting
obligations
to
the
indian
interests
and
to
the
reclamation
project
interests.
thank
you.
