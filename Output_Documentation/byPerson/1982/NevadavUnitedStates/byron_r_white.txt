who
were
the
orr
ditch
defendants?
justice
byron
r.
white
wholly...
who
had
pre-existing
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
wholly
aside
from
those
who
would
get
water
from
the
newlands?
justice
byron
r.
white
wholly
aside
from
those
who
would
get
water
from
the
newlands.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
said...
yes,
it
said
it
didn't
distinguish
the
water
right
for
a
fishery,
and
it
was
for
what
they
had
lost
in
the
past.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
water
is
the
government
seeking?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
quantify
the
newlands
water
right
they
were
claiming
in
terms
of
what
acreage
they
planned
to
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
land
all
under
private
ownership
then,
or
did
the
united
states
own
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
water
was
allocated
for
all
of
it,
and
all
of
it,
i
take
it,
has
later
become
privately
owned.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
any
contracts
entered
into
for
the
delivery
of
water
before
the
final
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
long
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
newlands
finished?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
was
water
first
delivered
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose,
then,
they
were
delivered
under
contract
with
private
owners?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
really,
was
it
with
a
contract
with
tcid,
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
well,
who
entered
into
contracts
with
the
private
water
users?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
tcid
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
bound,
was
it,
to
observe
the
contracts
the
united
states
had
entered
into?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
was
all
the
water
generated
by
newlands
covered
by
contract
with
private
owners?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
all
the
water
there
is
available,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
divide
up
the
truckee
and
the
carson
between
the...
the
orr
ditch
defendants,
the
newlands
water
contractees,
and
the
reservation,
you
have
used
all
the
water.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
then
the
united
states
has
simply
in
effect
or
actually
sold
water
to
these
private
owners.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
sold
water
rights
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
they
are
owned.
the...
own
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
the
effect
of
this
suit
or
this
judgment
is
to
set
aside
those
conveyances
to
some
extent,
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
whether
they
really
purchased
it.
who
is
paying
back
the
cost
of
the
project?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
ever
paid
it
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
also
some
contract
obligations
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
their
historic...
that
was
their
ancestral
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
they
get
up
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
they
using
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
returned?
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
they
couldn't
get
above
the
derby
dam?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
oh,
yes,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
fish
were
the
indians
selling
to
the
army,
or
to
the
white
settlers?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
you
are.
now,
what
about
adversity
at
the
time
of
the
final
decree?
who
had
an
interest
in
the
newlands
water
right
at
the
time
of
the
final
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
project
farmers
did,
and
you
wouldn't...
would
you
say
that
they
were
adverse
to
the...
any
more
water
for
the
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
have
adverse
interests
in
the
water
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
by
the
time
of
the
final
decree,
it
wasn't
just
the
united
states
that
was
asking
for
a
water
right,
or
whose
water
right
was
being
adjudged.
you
aren't
really
suggesting
what
the
united
states
argued,
that
they
could
take...
they
could
today
take
this
newlands
water
right
and
give
it
to
a
national
forest?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
they
could
reallocate
any
way
they
wanted
to
the
newlands
water
right
just
because
it
was
adjudicated
to
them
in
1943
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
well,
i
have
read
their
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose,
mr.
kneedler,
they
had
been
absolute
parties,
named
parties
by
the...
in
the
case
by
the
time
of
the
final
decree
by
virtue
of
their...
by
virtue
of
their
contracts
with
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
might
well,
or
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
it
would,
but
you
think
this
case
is
different
just
because
the
united
states
was
sitting
there
with
a
bunch
of
contracts
with
landowners,
and
they
got
a
final
decree
in
the
united
states'
favor
for
the
newlands
project,
knowing
all
the
time
that
they
had
contracted
away
all
of
that
water
that
was
available,
and
that...
don't
you
think
that
the
united
states
at
least
ought
to
be
subject
to
specific
performance
of
their
contracts
rather
than...
rather
than
take
the
water
away
and
let
the...
and
have
to
pay
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
amount
of
water
was
adjudicated
to
newlands.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
united
states
had
already
contracted
it
all
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
that
had
already
been
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
had
all
been
done
by
the
time
of
the
final
decree.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
the
united
states
was
just,
in
a
way,
not
only
a
representative
of
the
tribe,
but
a
representative
of
the
landowners
in
the
final
decree?
they
had
already
contracted
all
their
rights
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
about
for
the
purposes
of
res
judicata?
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
that
conflict
of
interest,
however,
wouldn't
prevent
res
judicata
from
attaching
if
the
newlands
landowners
had
been
parties
at
the
time
of
the
final
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
it
would
be
dispositive
of
the
res
judicata
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
defend
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
judgment.
how
about
the
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
relying
on
the
ground
here,
at
least
one
of
your
grounds,
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
use,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
your
arguments,
i
take
it,
wholly
independent
of
res
judicata,
is
that
the
water
was
adjudicated
to
the
united
states,
and
that
as
long
as
you...
and
that
you
can
take
the
water
away
from
one
of
your
contractees
and
give
it
to
somebody
else
just
as
long
as
you
are
willing
to
pay
the
contractees.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
was
the
message
of
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
you
can--
--i
did,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
reallocate
your
water
any
way
you
want
to
as
long
as
you
are
willing
to
pay
whoever
you
hurt.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
certainly...
i
must
have
misread
your
brief,
mr.
kneedler.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
certainly
possible.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
went
on
and
said,
we
may
reallocate
our
water
right,
and
if
the
landowners
have
any
beef,
they
can
come
and
try
to
get
paid.
that's
what
you
said
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
what
i
suggested
was
your
opening
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
you
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
may
be
right.
who
knows?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
take
water...
where
is
the
dam
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
dam
is
above
the
split.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
at
the
split?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
water...
you
could
bring
water
to
the
reservation
from
behind
the
dam?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
water
that
is
stored
is
available
to
the...
physically
available.
