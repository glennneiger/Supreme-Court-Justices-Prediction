mr.
frederick
g.
girard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
government
contends
in
this
case
that
it
owns
the
project
water
rights.
it
contends
that
the
orr
ditch
degree
permits
it
to
change
the
manner
and
place
and
purpose
of
use
of
its
water
rights
to
non-project
purposes
or
uses.
basically,
the
government's
contention
is
that
it
can
allocate
as
it
chooses
the
newlands
project
water
rights
to
pyramid
lake
or
presumably,
if
that
argument
is
valid,
to
any
federal
purpose
that
it
desires,
including
a
possible
mx
missile
site.
in
our
opinion,
the
government's
contention
is
simplistic
and
wrong.
orr
ditch
in
the
decree
did
not
decide
the
ownership
of
the
water
rights
as
between
the
project
owners
and
the
united
states.
in
fact,
there
is
a
specific
caveat
in
the
degree
which
states
that.
this
court
has
held
in
ickes
versus
fox
in
1937
that
project
water
rights
identical
to
these
water
rights
are
appropriated
for
the
benefit
of
the
farmers,
not
the
united
states,
and
that
the
project
farmers
own
the
water
rights,
not
the
government,
and
that
the
government's
interest
is
only
as
a
lienholder
to
secure
the
repayment
costs
of
the
project.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
yes,
the
degree
provides,
justice
white,
for
the
allocation
of
water
to
232,000
of
acres,
or
gives
the
government
the
right
to
divert
water
for
232,000
acres.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
both.
some
of
it
was
in
private
ownership.
some
of
it
was
owned
by
the
united
states.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
that
is
correct.
purchased
from
the
government.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
the
action
was
filed,
they
were
just
initiating
the
construction
of
the
project.
the
haunton
dam,
which
is
the
principal
feature,
was
not
constructed
until
1915.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
yes,
certainly--
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
--certainly
i
would
say
the
majority.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
the
physical
project
was
finished
about
in
1919,
i
would
guess,
judge.
there
may
have
been--
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
--water
was
first
delivered...
well,
the
first
delivery
of
water
was
1908.
over
the
whole
project,
probably
about
that
period
of
time.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
right.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
no,
tcid
was
not
in
existence
until
1926.
the
government--
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
--the
united
states.
the
united
states
entered
into
contracts.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
tcid
became
the
operator
of
the
project
in
1926.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
for
the
united
states,
under
a
contract
which--
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
--yes,
and
incidentally,
tcid
itself
entered
into
some
contracts
with
some
of
the
landowners
who
had
purchased
their
water
rights
after
1926.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
and
tcid
itself
in
the
orr
ditch
decree
was
given
the
right
to
divert
the
water
allocated
to
the
united
states,
and
the
decree
was
allocated
to
tcid
to
divert
in
the
truckee
river
agreement,
which
was
a
part
of
the
decree.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
there
are
contract
water
rights
on
the
newlands
project
covering
73,002
acres,
not
232,000
acres.
there
is
nowhere
near
enough
water
to
irrigate
232,000
acres.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
that's
correct,
from
both
rivers,
the
carson
and
the
truckee.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
that's
correct,
except
for
years
where
you,
you
know,
where
you
have
like
a
million
acres
flowing
down
the
river.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
which
just
goes
to
pyramid
lake,
but
in
a
normal
year,
that's
correct,
justice
white.
now--
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
--nevada
has
a
system
appropriation
in
nature,
and
you
file
an
appropriation,
you
acquire
a
water
right
by
a
permit.
i
would
think
it
is
relatively
simple.
now,
in
addition
to
ickes
versus
fox,
these
project
water
rights
in
this
very
case
on
the
newlands
project,
the
ownership
of
them
have
been
litigated
in
a
federal
district
court
case,
u.s.
versus
alpine
land
and
reservoir
company,
which
was
affirmed
on
appeal
recently,
and
insofar
as
the
appeal
is
concerned,
the
government
did
not
challenge
the
ownership
of
the
district
court's
finding
as
to
the
ownership.
the
district
court
in
that
case
specifically
held
that
these
newlands
project
water
rights
were
owned
by
the
project
farmers,
not
the
united
states.
on
appeal
in
the
briefs
the
government
did
not
challenge
that.
now,
our
position
is
very
simple.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
they
have
sold--
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
--sold
them
a
water
right,
and
it
is
designated
as
such
in
the
conveyances.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
the
water
right...
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
the
plain
fact
of
the
matter
is,
this
suit
has
prevailed.
they
will
not
get
the
water
that
was
sold
to
them.
they
will
get
less
water
by
about
50
percent
than
they
purchased.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
in
this
case
the
project
users.
and
incidentally--
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
--ninety-five
percent
of
the
purchase
of
the
land
and
the
water
rights
have
been
paid
off
today,
since
this
project.
this
project
was
the
first
reclamation
project
constructed.
now,
there
have
been
additions
that
have
been
going
on
regularly
to
the
project.
from
the
original
cost
of
these
lands
and
water
rights,
95
percent
of
them
have
been
paid
off
by
the
project
farmers.
again,
and
these
are
relatively
small
project
farmers.
i
think
on
this
district
the
average
farm
is
60
acres,
which
is
a
relatively
small
farm.
now,
i
would
like
to
also
discuss
the
united
states'
statement
in
light
of
the
indian
claims
commission,
where
it
contends
in
its
brief
or
acknowledge
that
it
breached
its
duty
to
the
tribe.
we
don't
agree.
we
don't
think
that
the
duty
was
breached.
we
think
the
attorneys
in
orr
ditch
did
a
capable
job
under
the
circumstances,
but
i
would
like
to
at
least
state
that
the
united
states'
admission
would
be
commendable
if
it
were
willing
to
assume
responsibility
for
its
breach.
its
position
is
that
we
breached
our
duty,
but
someone
else
should
suffer
the
detriments,
the
project
farmers.
in
fact,
its
position
is
even
less
altruistic.
in
the
indian
claims
commission
proceeding,
and
those
are
in
evidence
in
this
case,
the
ruling
of
the
indian
claims
commission
proceeding,
the
initial
ruling
provided
that
the
tribe
could
recover
its
damages
resulting
from
the
loss
of
its
water
rights
in
orr
ditch
if
the
tribe
could
establish
that
the
loss
was
attributable
to
the
united
states'
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
in
representing
the
indians
in
the
orr
ditch
case.
the
case
was
then
set
for
trial.
it
was
then
settled
for
$8
million.
then
the
parties
to
the
settlement,
the
united
states
and
the
tribe,
characterized
their
settlement
as
not
covering
the
loss
of
the
tribe's
fishery
right
while
at
the
same
time
agreeing
that
the
$8
million
precluded
the
tribe
from
seeking
additional
compensation
from
the
united
states
for
the
loss
of
that
fishery
right
if
the
end
result
of
this
case
establishes
that
the
fishery
right
is
barred.
so,
bluntly
stated,
the
bottom
line
in
this
case
is
that
the
tribe
received
$8
million,
it
knowingly...
and
that
$8
million
was
not
for
the
loss
of
the
fishery
right
in
the
future...
it
knowingly
waived
its
right
to
go
against
the
united
states
for
compensation
for
that
loss,
and
in
addition,
as
found
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
in
finding
of
fact
30,
the
fishery
has
been
restored
at
pyramid
lake
by
the
expenditure
of
some
$32
million
for
fish
hatcheries
and
things
along
that
line.
so,
the
bottom
line,
at
least
in
our
view
in
this
case,
is
that
everyone
has
relied
on
the
finality
of
the
orr
ditch
decree.
the
decree
was
entered
about
40
years
ago.
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
was
entered
by
the
court
was
entered
almost
60
years
ago.
the
decree
was
a
stipulated
decree
in
which
tcid
itself
was
a
party,
signed
it,
its
representatives,
along
with
the
united
states.
the
orr
ditch
decree,
that
decree
has
probably
influenced
in
a
major
way
the
development
of
northern
nevada,
certainly
churchill
county,
which
is
where
the
newlands
project
is.
the
parties
have
relied
on
it,
the
orr
ditch
defendants.
subsequent
appropriators
people
who
came
in
later
and
acquired
up
water
rights
after
that
decree,
have
relied
on
it.
that
decree
has
determined
whether
project
water
rights
are
available,
and
certainly
no
one
more
than
the
newlands
project
farmers
have
relied
on
it.
they
came
in--
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
--no,
i...
tcid
came
into
the
picture,
was
not
in
existence
until
1926.
it
came
in
and
operated.
i
am
making
these
arguments
more
for
the
project
farmers
than
tcid.
i
don't
claim
that
tcid
has
the
water
rights.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
tcid
was
designated
by
the
trial
court
as
a
class
representative
of
the
project
farmers,
and
when
i
make
that
statement,
i
really
mean
it
as
far
as
the
project
farmers,
not
the
entity.
they
own
the
water
right,
not
tcid.
mr.
frederick
g.
girard
yes,
and
we
fully
perform
them.
in
this
case,
finality
was
intended
by
everybody,
and
the
project
farmers
purchased
their
water
rights,
they
leveled
their
land,
they
built
their
crops,
they
relied
on
the
decree,
and
we
feel
that
this
is
the
type
of
a
case
where
the
decree
should
be
enforced.
thank
you,
judge.
