mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
fundamental
constitutional
questions
regarding
the
broad
exercise
and
extension
of
police
authority
and
the
relationship
between
that
authority
and
an
individual
in
a
free
society.
through
646(e),
police
make
and
enforce
as
elements
of
a
criminal
law
requiring
innocent
persons
to
disclose
proof
of
identification
upon
official
demand,
deliberately
imprecise
and
evolving
standards
designed
to
govern
investigatory
activities.
analysis
of
646(e)
therefore
turns
upon
two
basic
concerns
which,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
address
this
afternoon:
first,
whether
incorporation
of
the
so-called
terry
standard
as
an
element
of
a
646(e)
offense,
based
upon
the
moment
to
moment
decisionmaking
by
a
police
officer,
deprives
that
statute
of
any
objective
core;
and
if
so,
whether
it
thereby
impermissibly
offends
due
process
vagueness
doctrine
by
encouraging
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement,
by
denying
fair
notice,
and
by
trenching
upon
basic
constitutional
rights
of
privacy,
security
and
mobility.
and
second,
whether
647(e)
works
in
two
ways
to
undermine
the
central
importance
of
the
probable
case
requirement:
whether
it
offends
the
fourth
amendment
by
sanctioning
intrusions
upon
individual
security
and
privacy
upon
less
than
probable
cause,
and
upon
no
other
interest
than
the
general
one
in
crime
prevention
and
detection,
but
not,
as
mr.
petersen
would
have
it,
based
upon
whatever
incremental
advantage
exists
through
the
existence
of
a
criminal
sanction;
and
whether
it
also
subverts
fourth
amendment
guarantees
by
converting
the
power
to
make
inquiry
and
to
investigate
upon
less
than
probable
cause
into
the
power
to
arrest
and
search
absent
functionally
at
least
the
existence
of
probable
cause.
let
me
start
with
the
vagueness
issue,
and
let
me
pay
particular
attention
to
the
issue
which
justice
o'connor
has
raised,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
statute
in
fact
requires
persons
within
the
state
of
california
to
carry
and
to
display
at
all
times
upon
official
demand
proof
of
identification.
for
in
practice
647(e)
is
functionally
indistinguishable
from
the
very
sort
of
stop
and
identify
statute
in
application
which
this
court
specifically
disapproved
of
in
brown
versus
texas.
the
consequence
of
647(e)
is
that
in
california
there
is
a
internal
passport
requirement.
this
is
true
because
the
basis
for
a
terry
stop
and
demand,
an
officer's
basis
which
mr.
petersen
described,
is
both
unknown
and
unknowable
to
anyone
but
the
detaining
officer,
including
of
course
the
individual
detained.
and
this
is
true
for
two
reasons
that
go
to
the
heart
of
the
terry
decision:
first,
the
decision
stop
an
individual
under
terry
is
one
that
is
peculiar
dependent
upon
the
skill
and
the
experience
and
the
training
of
the
officer.
as
justice
powell
stated
in
mendenhall
and
as
the
chief
justice
has
stated
in
court
and
in
brown
versus
texas,
this
sort
of
skill
and
experience
and
training
simply
is
not
available
to
the
average
lay
person.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no,
of
course
not.
what
terry
established
was
an
objective
standard
for
courts
to
review
whether
or
not
a
stop
which
took
place
in
the
past
was
constitutional
or
not.
but
the
critical
point
for
our
purposes
with
respect
to
notice
is
whether
the
individual
on
the
street,
the
person
who
is
being
detained
by
the
officer,
can
make
a
judgment
at
that
time
as
to
whether
he
or
she
wishes
to
state
his
or
her
rights
under
brown
versus
texas
and
say,
i
don't
believe
you
have
reasonable
suspicion
here,
i
don't
want
to
have
to
disclose
my
identity
to
you,
i
want
to
rest
upon
my
rights,
or
whether
the
person
has
any
opportunity
to
make
that
sort
of
judgment.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
well,
that's
an
interesting
question.
i
would
say
first
that
if
the
statute
had
a
probable
cause
requirement
it
would,
first
of
all,
probably
be
an
unnecessary
statute,
because
as
justice
o'connor
indicated
earlier,
at
that
point
the
officer
can
conduct
a
search.
the
officer
can
actually
reach
into
the
individual's
pocket.
but
with
respect
to
the
vagueness
question
that
you're
asking
about,
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
say
it
would
be
a
close
question,
but
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
difference
which
this
court
has
recognized
on
numerous
occasions
between
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion.
probable
cause
comes
with
a
lot
more
freight,
and
in
addition
probable
cause
is
a
recognition
in
this
society
that
we
will
accept
different
sorts
of
relationships
between
the
individual
and
the
law
enforcement
apparatus.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
and
because
of
that
we
will
permit
the
police
to
make
certain
intrusions
upon
individual
privacy
that
we
won't
permit
in
the
nothing
situation.
but
the
issue
as
far
as
notice
is
concerned
is
whether
the
individual
on
the
street
is
capable
of
making
the
judgment
as
to
whether
the
officer
who's
doing
the
detention--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--well,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first,
as
i
indicated
to
your
honor,
it
is
a
close
question,
but
probable
cause
comes
with
a
different
set
of
freight
and
it
is
more
understandable.
moreover,
we
are
talking
about
a
vagueness
doctrine,
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
last
time
in
the
hoffman
estates
case,
the
drug
paraphernalia
case,
the
mesquite
case,
the
case
involving
the
licensing
ordinance,
we
will
adjust
our
vagueness
standards
depending
upon
the
constitutional
rights
that
are
involved.
in
the
probable
cause
situation
which
you
hypothesized,
we
are
willing
to
draw
perhaps
a
less
strong
line
in
terms
of
what
we
would
expect
from
the
individual
himself.
but
the
basic
point,
of
course,
is
that
in
the
probable
cause
hypothesis
that
you
state
there
simply
is
no
need
for
the
sort
of
statute
that
you're
describing
in
the
first
place.
and
returning
again
to
the
notice
point
that
we're
talking
about,
the
problem
of
the
individual
on
the
street,
not
having
the
skill
and
the
training
and
the
experience
of
the
officer,
is
compounded
because
quite
fundamentally
that
individual
simply
doesn't
have
the
information
available
to
the
officer.
what
precipitates
the
terry
stop
may
be
an
informant's
tip,
as
in
adams
versus
williams,
may
be
a
dea
profile,
as
in
reed
versus
georgia,
it
may
simply
be
a
call
from
the
patrol
car.
but
whatever
the
basis
of
that
information,
the
individual
on
the
street,
who
ought
to
be
able
to
decide
comfortably
with
the
knowledge
that
at
the
very
minimum
that
individual
has
the
rights
guaranteed
by
this
court
in
brown
versus
texas,
simply
has
no
way
of
making
an
assessment
as
to
whether
or
not
a
forfeiture
ought
to
exist
here,
whether
or
not
it
is
proper
to
disclose
identification.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
i
have
two
strong
points
with
respect
to
vagueness,
your
honor.
the
first
is
the
notice--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--i
think
both
the
vagueness
argument
and
the
fourth
amendment
arguments
are
compelling
in
this
particular
case.
the
other
prong
of
the
vagueness
argument
that
i
want
to
focus
upon
that
complements
this
particular
notice
requirement
is
the
fact
that,
as
an
incorporation
of
the
terry
standard
within
647(e),
that
incorporation
means
that
the
statute
has
no
objective
core.
it
is
like
the
massachusetts
flag
desecration
statute
which
this
court
ruled
unconstitutional
in
smith
versus
goguen.
like
the
phrase
there,
"treats
contemptuously",
there
is
no
basis
here
for
an
objective
standard
because
what
is
taking
place
here
is
that
an
element
of
the
crime
is
being
defined
by
the
moment
to
moment
decisionmaking
of
the
officer
on
the
street.
what
647(e)
does
is
to
codify
an
officer's
suspicions
regarding
wrongdoing
and
then
to
criminalize
the
failure
of
an
individual
to
allay
those
particular
suspicions
or
to
furnish
information.
and
while
we
are
perfectly
willing,
as
a
matter
of
recognizing
the
importance
of
investigations,
to
say
that
where
that
standard
appears
as
part
of
an
investigatory
statute
or
part
of
an
investigatory
standard,
to
consciously
relax
our
standards
of
vagueness--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--it
is
that
the
statute
is
vague
because
it
is
not
capable
of
any
constitutional
application.
there
is
no
way
that
this
statute
can
be
applied
without
causing
a
forfeiture
of
the
rights
which
this
court
guaranteed
in
brown
versus
texas.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct,
because
whether
you
look
at
vagueness
or
whether
you
look
at
the
fourth
amendment
argument,
what
is
inherent
in
this
statute
is
a
forfeiture
of
the
rights
of
privacy
and
security
and
mobility
that
were
guaranteed
under
brown
versus
texas.
the
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement
therefore
flows
from
the
use
of
this
investigatory
standard
as
one
of
the
elements.
and
as
i
indicated,
while
this
court
has
indicated,
has
stated
that
it
will
relax
standards
of
vagueness
in
circumstances
short
of
a
criminal
sanction,
where
the
element
becomes
part
of
it
different
constitutional
considerations
flowing
from
the
fact
that
a
breach
of
a
criminal
statute
results
in
arrest
and
imprisonment
means
that
we
have
to
use
a
tighter
consideration.
and
if
there
be
any
doubt
that
this
statute
in
fact
works
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
enforcement,
this
court
need
only
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
studies
perceiving
urban
realities
that
we
cite
in
our
papers.
for
in
this
case
mr.
lawson,
a
black
man
of
unconventional
appearance,
was
stopped
not
less
than
15
times
over
a
22-month
period
on
occasional
visits
to
the
san
diego
area,
always
in
white
neighborhoods,
always
by
white
officers.
and
on
not
one
of
those
occasions
was
he
ever
charged,
arrested
or
prosecuted
for
any
other
offense.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that
would
also
be
an
unconventional
appearance.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that
of
course
would
permit
a
terry
stop.
but
it
still
wouldn't
answer
our
basic
question
with
respect--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes,
the
individual--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes,
could
be
stopped
and
could
be
requested
for
identification.
but
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
or
not
those
questions
can
be
asked.
as
justice
white
indicated
in
terry,
those
questions
may
be
asked
of
any
individual
detained.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
and
turning
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis,
it
was...
your
statement
in
terry
itself
in
the
concurring
opinion
has
since
been
restated,
both
in
davis,
where
it
was
regarded
as
"settled
principle",
and
in
dunaway
versus
new
york...
that
really
indicates
the
underpinnings
of
the
fourth
amendment
argument
here,
because
this
statute
undermines
the
fourth
amendment
in
two
particular
ways.
first,
as
justice
o'connor
was
indicating,
what
it
does
is
to
in
every
application
dissolve
the
probable
cause
requirement
unless
an
individual
is
prepared
to
waive
his
or
her
constitutional
rights
with
respect
to
interference
with
police
officers.
this
statute,
if
you
think
about
it,
is
really
nothing
more
than
a
newfangled
variation
of
the
same
sort
of
vagrancy
law
that
this
court
struck
down
in
papachristou
versus
jacksonville,
because
there
it
manufactured
probable
cause
to
arrest
persons
appearing
suspicious.
this
statute
manufactures
probable
cause
to
arrest
persons
appearing
suspicious
who
refuse
to
allay
those
suspicions.
let's
look
at
how
thus
statute
actually
works.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
certainly.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
the
officer
can
ask
the
questions.
if
there
is
no
response,
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
terry,
that
can
alert
the
officer's
need
for
continuing
observation.
but
it
is
the
fourth
amendment
that
answers
the
question
that
you
pose,
justice
stevens,
because
if
the
failure
to
answer
and
to
do
nothing
more
than
place
the
individual
under
close
surveillance--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--if
the
officer
could
do
that,
then
what
would
happen
is
there
would
be
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
this
statute
would
not
exist.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no,
to
the
contrary.
that's
the
nub
in
this
particular
statute.
if
a
refusal
to
answer,
and
it's
just
a
simple
question,
what's
your
name,
and
the
person
just
stands
silent,
if
in
fact
that
would
not
cause
enough
information
to
be
added
to
the
initial
suspicion
to
cause
probable
cause,
then
the
fourth
amendment
demands
that
the
person
be
let
go.
more
questions
could
be
asked.
the
officer
could
say,
why
won't
you
give
us
any
answer,
what
are
you
doing
in
this
neighborhood,
whatever
questions
a
trained
officer
believes
appropriate.
but
if
at
the
conclusion
of
those
questions
the
officer
doesn't
have
enough
information
to
form
probable
cause,
then
the
fourth
amendment
mandates
that
the
individual
be
released
and
whatever
appropriate
surveillance
continue,
whatever
appropriate
observation
continue.
but
that's
a
balance
that
i'm
not
making;
that
is
a
balance
that
is
inherent
in
the
probable
cause
requirement.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
correct.
and
that
really
comes
close
to
what
the
case,
of
course,
is
all
about.
that
is,
the
relationship
between
law
enforcement
and
the
individual
and
what
may
be
our
repugnance,
on
civic
basis
or
moral
basis,
to
individuals
not
furnishing
answers.
but
to
go
so
far
as
to
arrest
because
of
failure
to
provide
information,
without
anything
more...
this
isn't
a
michigan
versus
defillippo
case,
where
the
person
first
says,
i'm
sergeant
mash,
and
then
i'm
someone
else,
and
that
may
accrete
enough
information
to
cause
probable
cause.
short
of
that,
the
officer
cannot
arrest
the
individual
for
failure
to
give
a
name
and
identification.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
no,
because
when--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no,
i
think
that
would
be
improper.
i
think
finest
it
would
most
likely
be
unnecessary
because
of--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--no.
there's
a
fifth
amendment
problem
that
would--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--right.
once
the
probable
cause
to
arrest
takes
place,
then
we
have
either
a
custodial
interrogation
setting
or
something
remarkably
close,
and
it
would
be
fifth
amendment
considerations
that
would
govern
our
judgment.
but
i
want
to
return
to
how
this
statute
works
with
respect
to
probable
cause
in
its
actual
operation.
what
is
the
day
to
day
application,
not
a
fanciful
hypothetical,
but
how
does
it
really
work?
an
officer
approaches
an
individual
and
detains
that
individual.
the
individual
is
frozen.
the
officer
says
to
the
individual,
what
is
your
name
and
address?
and
the
individual
doesn't
answer,
perhaps
is
silent,
perhaps
refuses
to
answer
whatsoever.
what
is
the
state
of
affairs
in
terms
of
fourth
amendment
constitutional
doctrine
at
that
time?
well,
we
certainly,
assuming
the
officer
has
in
good
faith
made
a
terry
stop,
we
have
reasonable
suspicion.
but
we
don't
have
probable
cause
to
make
that
arrest.
and
what
that
also
means
under
terry
and
this
court's
decisions
in
robinson
versus
united
states,
in
gustavson
versus
florida,
is
that
the
officer
at
that
point
cannot
make
a
search.
then
what
happens
with
647(e)?
the
statute
is
activated,
an
arrest
is
made,
and
the
officer
at
that
point
can
make
an
arrest
and
a
search
and
obtain
the
very
information
which
moments
ago
the
fourth
amendment
precluded.
it
is
a
probable
cause
manufacturing
machine.
let's
look
at
it
in
another
way.
an
officer
goes
up
to
a
person
and
wants
to
reach
into
the
person's
pocket
to
get
the
id,
but
is
precluded
by
the
fourth
amendment
because
they
only
have
terry.
the
officer
says
to
the
individual,
you
reach
in
your
pocket
and
other
identification,
and
the
individual
refuses
or
is
silent.
647(e)
is
activated
and
it
is
the
law...
it
the
law...
that
then
permits
the
officer
to
reach
into
the
individual's
pocket
and
extract
the
very
identification
which
just
moments
ago
the
probable
cause
requirement
absolutely
forbade.
there
is
no
way--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--that's
correct.
it
is
more
it
is
more
than
just
a
reaching
in
for
identification.
it
is
that
plus,
because
then
the
individual
is
subjected
to
all
the
constitutional
deprivations
that
attach
to
the
arrest
and
to
the
full
search
that
just.
white
just
mentioned.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
they
can
make
a
full
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
that's
what
this
court--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--perhaps
i'm
not
being
clear.
i'm
discussing
the
situation
where
under
this
statute
the
officer
obtains
probable
cause.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
actually
your
point
indicates
how
the
fourth
amendment
can
be
subverged,
because
they
start
with
terry
and
very
limited
powers
of
the
frisk,
and
all
of
a
sudden
with
647(e)
entering
the
case
it
is
a
full
search
incident
to
arrest
that
is
permitted.
and
that's
one
of
the
fourth
amendment
problems
with
the
statute.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
and
that's
because
society
has
recognized
that
the
possession
of
a
concealed
weapon
is
a
substantive
offense
that
we
will
punish
and
permit
to
have
a
search
incident
to
afterwards.
but
what's
the
substantive
offense
in
our
case?
in
our
case
it
is
a
crime
out
of
what
is
not
a
crime.
all
the
person
has
done
is
refuse
to
allay
suspicions,
either
silently,
noisily
or
whatever.
and
all
of
a
sudden
that
becomes,
not
like
a
concealed
weapon,
but
that
becomes
the
basis
for
the
full
arrest
and
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes,
but
in
michigan
versus
defillippo,
the
court
declared
that
statute
there
unconstitutional.
and
that
issue--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--if
the
statute
is
constitutional,
my
argument
obviously
falls,
but
what
i'm
indicating--
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
--yes,
and...
but
the
question
is
what
happens
to
the
probable
cause
requirement
in
those
circumstances.
and
that's
just
one
of
the
ways
that
the
probable
cause
requirement
is
undermined
in
this
particular
case.
let's
look
at
what
this
does
with
respect
to
permitting
intrusions
upon
constitutional
rights
of
security
and
privacy
and
mobility
upon
less
than
probable
cause
for
the
governmental
interest
here
that
is
accrued
through
the
existence
of
a
statute;
that
penalizing
the
disclosure
of
identification.
and
in
this
respect,
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
its
decisions
in
terry
and
brignoni
ponce
and
summers.
in
terry,
this
court
stated
that
it
would
permit
a
frisk
of
an
individual,
non-stopped,
upon
less
than
probable
cause
but
not
upon
a
general
interest
in
crime
prevention
or
detection.
rather,
the
terry
frisk
was
specifically
predicated
upon
preserving
an
officer's
safety
in
circumstances
that
would
warrant
concern.
it
was
not
prevention
or
detection,
though
obviously,
that
option
was
available
to
it.
mr.
mark
d.
rosenbaum
yes.
and
what
we're
looking
at
in
this
case
is
what
will
we
permit
short
of
probably
cause
in
additional
to
estop.
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
has
never
permitted
an
intrusion
of
this
sort
of
character
beyond
the
stop
itself
for
an
interest
just
from
the
generalized
one,
in
crime
prevention
or
detection.
that's
what
terry
indicated
with
respect
to
the
justification
of
the
frisk.
let's
look
at
brignoni
ponce
which
i
would
contend
in
many
ways
controls
this
case.
indeed,
i
would
suggest
that
mr.
petersen's
argument
simply
cannot
be
squared
with
the
holding
of
that
case.
in
brignoni
ponce,
this
court
examined
a
roving
patrol
that
was
interested
in
determining
whether
or
not
aliens,
in
violation
of
immigration
laws,
were
being
transported.
and
this
court
stated
that
upon
less
than
probable
cause,
upon
reasonable
suspicion,
stop
estop
would
be
permitted.
now,
what
is
significant
about
this
case
for
our
purposes
here
is
that
that
particular
style,
that
particular
intrusion
to
ask
questions
regarding
immigration
status,
was
purely
an
investigatory
act.
it
was
no
less
investigatory
than
the
sort
of
stops
of
mr.
lawson
that
took
place
in
the
san
diego
area.
but
what
is
critical
here
is
that
that
investigatory
stop
was
sanctioned
not
upon
the
general
interest
of
crime
prevention
or
detection
which
mr.
petersen
would
like
to
sustain
this
statute
on,
but
rather,
was
predicated
very
specifically
on
this
nation's
peculiar
problems
in
the
area
of
immigration.
and
the
court
will
recall
justice
powell,
at
pages
881
and
82,
specifically
stating
that
any
further
intrusion
beyond
asking
about
immigration
status
or
asking
about
the
suspicious
circumstances
regarding
immigration
would
not
be
permitted
under
the
fourth
amendment;
that
there
had
to,
at
that
point,
be
consent
or
probable
cause.
so
in
circumstances
remarkably
identical
to
the
circumstances
here,
the
general
interest
in
crime
prevention
or
detection
was
not
enough
to
sustain
the
intrusion.
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
predicated
upon
an
understanding
as
to
really
the
degree
of
advantage
that
law
enforcement
gains
through
the
actual
operation
of
a
statute
like
this.
not,
as
mr.
petersen
would
have
it,
some
sort
of
global
discussion
of
crime
prevention
or
detection.
but
rather,
what
is
involved
simply
by
having
this
particular
statute
available.
let's
look
at
that.
by
mr.
petersen's
own
tally,
there
are
only
some
eight
states
in
the
union,
only
some
eight
states,
that
even
have
statutes
like
this.
and
neither
mr.
petersen
nor
any
of
the
amiti
filing
papers
on
his
behalf,
has
cited
to
this
court
a
single
study
or
a
single
fact
that
would
indicate
that
it
is
the
existence
of
this
statute
that
is
responsible
for
the
advantages
gained.
nor
would
the
statute
itself
preclude
investigations
from
going
forward,
for
as
justice
white
has
indicated
in
his
statements,
the
individual
is
still
under
police
surveillance,
the
officers
are
still
free
to
continue
whatever
surveillance.
and
perhaps
the
most
interesting
point
of
all
flows
from
the
record
in
this
case,
because
when
you
examine
the
15-odd
stops
that
happened,
in
the
majority
of
stops
when
the
officer
sought
to
attain
information
from
mr.
lawson
regarding
identification,
they
didn't
use
the
statute
as
the
basis.
that
statute's
advantage,
as
an
increment
to
crime
prevention
or
detection,
while
i'm
not
suggesting
is
insubstantial,
while
i'm
not
suggesting
is
non-existent,
certainly
is
not
of
the
sort
or
magnitude
that
would
in
any
way
cause
the
gross
departure
from
the
probable
cause
requirement
that
is
stated
here,
that
is
suggested
here
by
the
government's
argument.
and
it
is
really
here
in
appreciation
of
that
fact
and
in
appreciation
of
the
discussion
that
we
had
with
respect
to
vagueness,
that
it
becomes
clear
as
to
what
this
case
is
all
about.
for
it
is
here
that
the
fundamental
policies
of
vagueness
and
the
fourth
amendment
coalesce.
for
while
in
circumstances
short
of
probable
cause,
it
may
be
our
moral
and
civic
judgment
that
individuals
questioned
by
the
police
should
respond,
including
even
disclosure
of
identity,
what
finally
defines
the
character
of
a
free
society
and
separates
it
from
a
totalitarian
one
is
ultimately
the
relationship
between
the
individual
and
the
law
enforcement
apparatus...
how
much
space
exists,
whether
one
is
free,
or
whether
one
is
subservient.
and
in
the
end,
this
case
is
much
more
than
a
case
about
the
amenities
of
life.
what
this
case
is
about
in
a
free
society
is
nothing
less
than
the
integrity
and
the
autonomy
of
the
individual,
and
what
our
collective
repugnance
will
be
to
an
attempt
to
destroy
those
particular
values.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
completed
my
argument.
