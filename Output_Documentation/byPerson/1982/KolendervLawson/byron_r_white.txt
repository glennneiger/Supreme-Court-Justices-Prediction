is
this
your...
do
you
think
this
is
your
strongest
point
here,
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
vagueness
argument
is
your
strongest
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could
also...
they
could
detain
him
until
they
asked
the
questions.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
he
should
not
be
forced
to
answer
the
question
at
the
pain
of
criminal
penalty.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
that
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
everybody
concedes
it,
the
state
could
then
say
that
once
there's
probable
cause
to
arrest
it
is
also
a
crime
to
refuse
to
give
the
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
making
a...
it
wouldn't
be
a
fourth
amendment
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
where
you
would--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
would
also
authorize
a
complete
search
incident
to
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
you
really
mean
what
you
say,
you
could
make
it
a
crime
to
refuse
to
identify
yourself
whether
there's
reasonable
suspicion
or
not.
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
anonymity;
and
therefore,
if
a
policeman
walks
up
to
you
without
any
reasonable
suspicion
and
just
happens
to
ask
you,
what's
your
name,
and
you
say
sorry,
it's
none
of
your
business,
you
could
be
committing
a
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
there
is
a
constitutional
right,
then,
to
anonymity.
