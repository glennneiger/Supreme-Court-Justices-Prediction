justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
following
up
on
that,
supposing
you
stopped
the
jogger,
you
asked
him
his
name,
he
says,
my
name
is
john
smith,
and
then
you
ask
him
these
additional
questions
about
how
he
ran
to
that
particular
location.
he
says,
i
would
prefer
not
to
tell
you.
does
he
commit
a
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
has
committed
a
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
has
committed
a
crime
if
he
says,
i
would
prefer
not
to
tell.
say
he
gives
his
address
also.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
nothing
with
him.
you
say,
would
you
tell
me,
what
route
did
you
jog
over
here
from.
he
says,
i
would
prefer
not
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--say
he
thinks
he's
lying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
he's
committed
a
crime?
but
say
he's
not
lying.
he
tells
him
truthfully
what
his
name
and
address
is,
but
he
declines
to
tell
him
how
he
got
from
point
a
to
point
b.
has
he
committed
a
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
he
says--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
maybe
on
the
way
over
he
robbed
someone.
maybe
he
snatched
a
purse
on
the
way
over.
and
he
figures
if
he
tells
him
how
he
came
he
would
incriminate
himself.
that
might
be
his
real
motive
for
not
wanting
to
tell
the
police
officer.
but
the
mere
fact
he
did
not
answer
is
a
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
told
you
what
he
gave.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
police
officer
have
to
give
him
any
kind
of
warning?
does
the
police
officer
have
to
give
him
any
kind
of
warning
that
the
information
might
help
them
catch
the
thief
who
stole,
in
my
hypothetical
case,
a
purse
three
blocks
away?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
your
explanation
of
the
statute,
without
any
miranda
warning
or
its
equivalent,
if
a
man
who
is
in
fact
suspected
of
committing
a
crime
is
stopped
and
asked
if
he
was
at
the
location
of
the
crime
and
he
just
says,
i'd
rather
not
answer,
he's
now
committed
the
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
was,
how
did
you
get
from
a
to
b.
and
you
said
if
he
doesn't
tell
me
he's
committed
the
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
told
him,
my
name
is
john
smith--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
your
opponents
argue
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
were
telling
us
how
the
statute
is
properly
construed
at
this
point,
as
a
preliminary
to
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
would
be
an
approved
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
then
said
the
customary
procedure
correctly
applied
under
the
statute
is
to
follow
up
with
a
question
of
how
did
you
get
from
a
to
b,
without
any
warning
of
the
consequences
of
either
answering
or
not
answering.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no.
you've
told
me
what
you
said
is
the
approved
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
what
about
the
"account
for
his
presence"
language
in
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
all
it
goes
to
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i'm
still...
if
it
weren't
for
that
language,
i
would
have
been
puzzled
by
your
statement
that
the
correct
practice
under
the
statute
would
be
to
ask
a
question
such
as,
what
are
some
of
the
neighboring
streets
or
how
did
you
get
from
there
to
here.
you
think
that
goes
to
the
reliability
of
the
identification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
you
have,
i
suppose
by
hypothesis,
at
the
time
of
the
stop
the
officer
suspects
him
of
being
engaged
in
criminal
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
so
he
thinks
he's
involved
in
criminal
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
says,
i
want
to
ask
you
your
name
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
doesn't
tell
him
he
thinks
he's
involved
in
criminal
activity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
have
to
notify
them
if
you
say,
how
did
you
get
here,
even
though
the
purpose
of
the
question
is
to
find
out
if
maybe
he's
the
purse-snatcher?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
following
up
on
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
question,
supposing
an
officer
does
encounter,
3:00
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
a
residential
neighborhood,
a
person
wearing
a
stocking
cap.
is
there
anything
he
can
do
to
that
person?
he
can
stop
him
and
ask
him
questions,
and
say
the
man
says,
i
won't
answer.
is
there
any
remedy
that's
available
to
the
police?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
the
officer
attach
evidentiary
significance
to
the
failure
to
answer,
if
you
assume
there's
a
constitutional
right
not
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
it
would
be
all
right
to
stop
him
and
if
he
doesn't
answer
say,
well,
now
i've
got
probable
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
that
there's
no
way
a
state
can
pass
a
statute
to
deal
with
the
hypothetical
case
i
give
you,
that
would
enable
the
officer
to
elicit
the
name
and
address
of
the
person
from
an
unwilling...
if
he
didn't
want
to
give
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
the
court
approved
in
michigan
against
defillippo,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
surely,
if
the
statute
had
been
constitutional
it
all
would
have
fallen.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
your
demonstration
of
what
flows
fro
the
statute
is
exactly
what
happened
in
de
fillippo.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
petersen,
that
seems
to
demonstrate
the
validity
of
your
opponent's
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
person
stopped
doesn't
know
the
basis
for
the
stop.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
did.
but
how
does
the
person
stopped
know
whether
the
statute
requires
him
to
answer
the
questions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
your
answer
is
that
the
person
stopped
can
never
know
whether
he
has
an
obligation
under
the
law
to
answer
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
the
policeman
doesn't
have
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
he
have
an
obligation
to
answer
if
the
policeman
does
not
have
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't
answer
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
the
statute
is
not
confined...
then
the
statute
is
not
confined
in
its
application
to
cases
in
which
the
officer
has
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
the
way
you
speaking
for
the
state
of...
or
city
of
san
diego...
interpret
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
that's
the
way...
what
you
mean.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that's
your
position.
well,
that's
contrary
to
the
california
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
solomon,
isn't
it?
that
you
can
be
required
to
answer
under
this
statute
if
there
isn't
reasonable
or
articulable
suspicion
under
terry?
