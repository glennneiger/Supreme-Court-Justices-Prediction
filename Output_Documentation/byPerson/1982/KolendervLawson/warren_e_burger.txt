chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
at
one
o'clock
we
will
hear
arguments
in
kolender
versus
lawson.
mr.
petersen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
part
of
a
patdown
process
in
wisconsin?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
statute
provides,
would
you
say,
wider
latitude
to
police
than
the
terry
stop?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
say
are
the
articulable
facts
that
supported
this
stop
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
just
take
the
last
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
much...
you
haven't
got
to
the
appearance
yet.
what
about
the
appearance
that
attracted
the
officer's
notice,
or
did
that...
is
that
known?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
that
you
mean
vandalism?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
latest
hypothetical
about
a
person
seemingly
lurking
around
a
house
late
at
night
prompts
this
question.
what
if
it's
high
noon
in
time
square
or
somewhere
in
los
angeles?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
is
your
answer
that
at
high
noon
in
the
downtown
district
of
los
angeles,
with
no
indication
usually
associated
with
drug
transfers,
just
simply
a
person
walking
along,
that
this
statute
would
not
authorize
a
stop?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rosenbaum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
argument
that
the
statute
is
vague
or
that
it's
overbroad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
if,
added
to
whatever
the
other
facts
were,
the
respondent
here,
the
appellee,
was
wearing
a
stocking
cap
over
his
head
with
holes
for
the
eyes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well--
[laughter]
i
was
thinking
of
something
a
little
more
than
unconventional.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
it
fit
under
this
statute?
could
he
be
properly
stopped
under
this
statute?
at
night,
after
dark,
stocking
mask
over
his
face?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
could
be
stopped?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
custodial
arrest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
petersen,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
dressed
like
a
criminal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
if
he
corresponds,
if
he
meets
a
description
that's
been
sent
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
kolender
against
lawson
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
o'connor.
