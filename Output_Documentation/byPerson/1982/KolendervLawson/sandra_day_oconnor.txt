justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
require
someone
to
carry
and
produce
identification?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
one
do
that
without
carrying
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
a
terry
stop
can
the
officer
reach
into
the
pocket
of
the
suspect
and
pull
out
his
wallet
and
check
for
id?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
this
court
ever
said
that
that's
all
right
under
a
terry
stop?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
the
california
statute
then
allow
the
same
information
to
be
obtained,
but
in
a
different
way?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
california
courts
have
interpreted
this
statute
to
require
the
person
stopped
to
account
for
his
presence
or
her
presence.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
sort
of
inquiry
you're
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
suppose
the
officer--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--suppose
the
officer
is
basically
on
the
lookout
for
the
neighborhood
rapist,
who
is
believed
to
drive
a
blue
car.
then
under
this
statute
can
he
go
on
and
inquire
about,
how
did
you
get
here,
did
you
travel
in
a
car,
what
color?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
right
there
on
the
street?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
under
terry
you
can't
compel
someone
to
produce
their
wallet
and
their
id,
how
is
this
statute
not
broader
than
terry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
may
be
broader
than
terry
if
justice
white's
view
is
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
initial
detention
is,
of
course.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
appeal
presents
a
facial
challenge
to
a
criminal
statute
that
requires
people
who
loiter
or
wander
on
the
streets
to
provide
a
credible
and
reliable
identification
and
to
account
for
their
presence
when
requested
by
a
police
officer
under
circumstances
that
would
justify
a
lawful
investigative
stop.
the
appellee,
lawson
was
detained
by
police
under
that
statute
on
approximately
15
occasions
in
less
than
two
years.
he
brought
suit
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
statute,
and
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
which
held
that
to
stop
and
identify
statute
was
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
the
fourth
amendment.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
ground
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
that
it
does
not
provide
a
clear
standard
of
enforcement.
the
statute
fails
to
specify
what
is
contemplated
by
the
requirement
that
a
suspect
provide
a
credible
and
reliable
identification.
the
statute
vests
complete
discretion
in
the
police
to
determine
whether
the
suspect
has
satisfied
the
statutory
requirements.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
white
with
whom
justice
rehnquist
joins
has
filed
a
dissent.
