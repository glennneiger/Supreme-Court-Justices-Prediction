mr.
a.
wells
petersen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
appellants
are
asking
this
court
to
find
california's
penal
code
section
647(e),
as
interpreted
by
people
v.
solomon,
constitutional;
furthermore,
that
when
the
statute
is
properly
applied,
it
satisfies
the
fourth
amendment
criteria;
and
finally,
that
when
the
police
acting
properly
under
the
statute
request
a
person
to
identify
themselves,
that
that
does
not
violate
their
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
the
facts
normally
in
a
case
like
a
terry
stop
case,
the
facts
are
normally
quite
important
and
very
relevant.
in
this
particular
case,
the
facts
surrounding
the
stop
of
mr.
lawson
are
not
relevant
because
the
matter
will
go
back
down
for
a
trial
at
the
district
court
level,
a
jury
trial
on
the
facts.
therefore,
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
and
really
they're
not
relevant
to
a
decision
today,
not
at
all.
it
is
first
critical
to
review
appellants'
claim
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
as
interpreted
by
the
solomon
court,
and
our
first
premise
is
that
because
of
solomon,
with
terry,
we
have
clear
standards
that
proscribe
the
police
in
enforcing
the
statute.
now,
the
court
below
recognized
the
statute
engrafted
the
guidelines
from
terry
through
solomon.
therefore,
before
647(e)
ever
comes
into
play
the
police
must
have
articulable
facts
demonstrating
their
belief
was
reasonable
that
the
person
was
acting
in
a
suspicious
manner
relating
to
criminal
activity.
this
standard
and
guideline
ensures
a
tempered
act
of
a
policeman.
as
this
court
held
recently
in
cortez,
the
police
action
must
be
considered
in
light
of
the
total
circumstances.
the
police
then
act
on
probabilities,
after
considering
the
data
at
their
disposal.
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
write
either
a
statute
or
an
opinion
that
encompassed
every
conceivable
situation
that
could
be
considered
suspicious,
and
that's
a
point
conceded
by
appellee.
but
it
isn't
even
necessary,
because
we
have
terry
that
sets
forth
adequate
standards
against
which
the
police
activity
is
measured.
now,
terry
obviously
was
both
loitering
and
wandering
for
a
criminal
purpose,
which
therefore
required
the
police
to
respond
because
the
public
safety
demanded
it.
now,
terry
provides
the
standards
not
only
for
stops,
but
also
probable
cause
to
arrest,
and
while
those
standards
may
lack
machine
tool
precision--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--there
was
also
a
request
for
an--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--there
was
a
request
for
identification--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--then
a
frisk,
and
then
an
arrest.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
that's
true.
but
while
these
standards
may
lack,
as
i
say,
the
precision
that
some
may
wish,
they
certainly
have
provided
constitutional
guidelines
since
their
inception
that
have
guided
courts
throughout
the
country.
and
california
has
only
memorialized
the
terry
stop
by
statute
and
court
opinion
intertwined
to
give
us
a
solid
basis
upon
which
to
judge
these
matters.
certainly,
the
standard
imposed
upon
the
police
to
articulate
what
they
perceive
as
criminal
activity
is
no
more
onerous
than
we
placed
on
the
police
in
making
a
stop,
a
driving
while
intoxicated
stop.
solomon
also
provides
the
second
leg
of
the
standard,
a
standard
for
what
satisfies
the
request
for
identification.
it
must
be
to
a
reasonable
policeman
reliable.
now,
while
this
may
present
some
problem
to
some,
we
ask
all
sorts
of
people
to
make
decisions
on
reliability.
we
ask
bartenders
to--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--no,
ma'am,
it
does
not.
it
does
not
do
that
at
all.
it
only
requires
that
the
officer
be
satisfied
that
the
identification
is
reliable.
i'm
sure
that
all
of
us
recognize
that
there
are
joggers
who
go
about--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--it's
quite
easy.
you
query.
in
other
words,
a
jogger
stopped...
and
we
all
recognize
the
fact
that
there
are
joggers
now
plying
their
trade
in
sweatpants
and
sweatshirts
because
it
makes
them
less
noticeable
in
the
jogging
atmosphere
and
they
can
run
away
from
their
crime.
but
if
a
person
were
jogging
and
wasn't
carrying
their
identification,
the
officer
would
merely
inquire
where
they
lived
and
their
name,
identification.
the
person
provides
it.
the
officer
then
asks
them
what
the
major
intersection
is
near
the
home,
what
the
route
was
that
he
ran
to
get
from
there,
or
where
it
is
in
relation
to
where
the
person
was
stopped.
all
of
these
things
that
seem
to
be
unable
to
be
answered
by
people
such
as
mr.
powell
in
nevada,
who
couldn't
respond
to
where
his
friends
lived
or
their
name
or
their
address
or
which
direction
he
was
rightfully
headed
at
that
time.
those
things
are
ways
of
getting
to
the
reliability
of
the
identification.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
he
has
not
provided
the
officer
the
level
of
identification
that
647(e)
requires
under
solomon.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
solomon
says
that
he
must...
that
you
must
discern
where
the
man
can
be
contacted
at
a
later
date
if
that's
necessary.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
well,
if
he
gives
his
name
and
address--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--if
the
officer
at
that
point
feels
that
that,
knowing
the
neighborhood--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--sure,
he
thinks
he's
lying.
then
he--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--yes.
i
find
it
difficult
in
the
scheme
of
a
rational
person--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--in
an
interface
with
the
police
not
being
willing
to
say,
well,
i
ran
down
this--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--if
he
did
not
give
reliable
identification.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
if
he
did
not
provide
reliable
identification,
because
you
said
that
the
police
officer
did
not
believe
him--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--there
is
no
requirement
that
i
know,
statutory
or
otherwise,
that
requires
a
policeman
to
inform
a
person
why
he
is
being
stopped.
now,
in
the
world
of
common
sense
and
the
way
that
police
operate,
normally
that
information
does
come
out
and
people
are
told
that--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--no,
not
if
he
responded--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--if
he
has
not
provided
the
officer
with
reliable
identification,
he
certainly
has.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
now,
leapfrogging
to
the
fifth
amendment
issue--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--i
realize
that,
and
if
you'd
like
to
discuss
that,
i
think
it's
important
to--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--there
might
be
other
ways
of
getting
to
the
reliability
of
the
data,
of
the
identification.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
all
we're
after
with
647(a)
is
the
man's
name
and
address,
or
the
woman's
or
the
person's.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
the
warnings
only
are
given
to,
can
you
provide
any
other
reason
why
i
should
believe
that
you
live
at
such
and
such
an
address.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
that's
right.
now,
the--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--under
wisconsin
law
they
certainly
can.
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
in
flynn
decided
that
and
said
they
could,
and
also--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--no,
it
was
part
of
asking
for
an
identification.
it
wasn't...
to
my
understanding
of
flynn,
it
was
not
part
of
seeking
weapons.
it
was,
the
officer
wanted
to
find
out
who
the
person
was
and
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
took
his
wallet.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
no,
not
to
my
knowledge
they
haven't.
they
denied
cert
in
flynn,
but
of
course
that
doesn't
necessarily--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--we
feel
that
there
are
certainly
ways
to
ask
for
a
reliable
identification
without
interfering
with
the
person's
fifth
amendment
rights,
as
justice
stevens
raised.
we
feel
that
there
are
certainly
ways
and
avenues
of
inquiry
which
can
be
used
that
will
bring
about
the
information
that
is
non-incriminatory.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
that
means
that
you
provide
reliable--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--that's
right.
you
must
only
provide
reliable
identification.
that's
all
that's
required.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
well,
what
you're
getting
to
is
identification.
the
reliable
information,
the
information
to
verify
that
the
identification
is
reliable,
is
what
he
was
getting
to,
i
believe,
if
i
read
his
question
correctly.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
that's
right.
he
said,
my
name
is
john
jones
and
i
live
at
25
main
street.
and
the
officer
for
some
reason
disbelieved
him
and
then
said,
well,
can
you
tell
me
how
you,
the
route
that
you
jogged,
or
can
you...
and
that
would
have
incriminated
him.
perhaps
he
would
have
said,
well,
you
know,
i
live
at
that
address
and
the
next
intersection
is
main
and
l,
and
that's
nearby
and
the
officer
would
recognize
that
and
recognize
the
information
as
reliable.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
i
think
that's
reasonable
and
i
think
it's
reasonable
police
action
that
we're
looking
for
here.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
well,
if
we're
talking
about
a
jogger,
no.
no,
once
the
person
has
given
reliable
identification,
he
may
not.
under
solomon
the
person
must
be
allowed
to
proceed.
that
doesn't
mean
that
some
time
in
the
future
when
the
detective
who
is
investigating
the
neighborhood
rapist
comes
upon
various
names
seen
under
suspicious
circumstances,
that
he
cannot
go
to
the
person's
home
and
make
further
inquiries
under
other
circumstances.
that's
just
normal
investigation.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
no,
that
isn't
authorized.
you
must
allow
him
to
go
on
his
way
once
he
provides
reliable
information.
if
what
he
tells
you
triggers
additional
suspicions,
such
as
what
occurred
when
mr.
powell
was
stopped
in
las
vegas,
then
certainly
further
inquiry...
a
policeman
would
be
remiss
if
he
did
not
inquire
further.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
the
"account
for
his
presence
language"
has
been
interpreted
by
solomon
to
mean
only
that
you
provide
reliable
identification,
not
that
i'm
here
because
i
want
to
stand
and
watch
something,
or
i'm
not
here
because...
i'm
here
at
the
corner
because
i'm
supposed
to
meet
someone.
that's
not
part
of
the
procedure
at
all.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
the
solomon
court
has
said
that.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
that's
right.
if
they
were
as
you
stated,
the
officer
disbelieved
the
person.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
already
has
articulable
facts
to
justify
the
first
intrusion.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
right.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
that's
right.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
no.
most
of
the
time
people
will...
the
interchange
will
result
in
that.
however,
there's
no
requirement,
as
i
stated
before,
that
i
know
of
where
you
have
to
notify
someone
why
you
are
stopping
them.
it
just
happens
that
most
people
are.
you
have
to
notify
them
at
the
arrest--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--no,
the
purpose
of
the
question
is
to
find,
is
to
gain
the
reliability
of
the
information.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
if
you
suspect
him
as
a
purse-snatcher,
you're
focusing
in
and
your
fifth
amendment
comes
into
play,
of
course,
at
that
time.
but
just
asking
a
name
and
address
has,
as
cited
in
my
reply
brief,
been
designated
as,
for
lack
of
a
better
word,
pedigree
information
that's
required,
that
doesn't
require
a
miranda
warning
before
you
require
that.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
no.
no
wider
latitude
whatsoever,
because
they're
inextricably
intertwined.
they
form
the
basis.
all
we've
done
is
memorialize
terry
with
a
statute
and
say
that
terry
applies
and
you
can
stop
a
person
and
ask
them
for
identification
under
terry
circumstances.
it's
a
terry
stop.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
because
terry
did
not
get
to
the
issue
of
requiring
the
person
to
provide
his
identification.
i
think
the
only
place
that
was
mentioned
was
in
justice
white's
concurring
opinion,
when
he
said
that
when
he
asked
them
for
identification
and
he
told
them,
mr.
terry
told
the
officer
what
his
identification
was,
in
justice
white's
opinion
he
said
that
if
he
had
chosen
not
to
tell
him
he
could
have
walked
away.
under
these
facts
and
circumstances,
we
feel
that
there's
a
reasonable
governmental
interest
in
having
the
person
provide
his
name,
and
the
people
of
california
have
so
stated
through
their
legislature.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
if
justice
white's
view
is
taken
as
part
of
the
opinion,
it
might
be
a
tad
broader.
but
still
in
all,
i
think
by
the
same
token
it's
more
restrictive,
too,
because
if
you
don't
have
reliable
information
under
which
you
think
your
safety
is
at
stake
you
can't
pat
them
down.
you
can
only
ask
for
their
name.
and
it
allows
a
lower
level
of
intrusion
than
a
terry
patdown,
and
that's
what
makes
this
very
reasonable.
it's
eminently
reasonable
that
if
a
person
is
suspected
of
criminal
activity,
say
it's
a
prostitute
on
the
corner
or
say
a
bookmaker
in
a
barbershop
or
something
like
that,
where
you
wouldn't
normally
feel
that
your
life
was
in
danger,
so
it
wouldn't
justify
a
patdown
search,
you
could
still,
with
articulable
facts
justifying
a
detention,
the
initial
detention,
you
could
still
inquire
as
to
their
name
and
address
and
identity.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
there
were
15
of
them.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
i
think
basically,
and
as
i
said
before,
i
really
didn't
come
prepared
to
discuss
the
facts
of
the
case
because
they're
going
to
be
litigated
again,
because
the
ninth
circuit
sent
it
back
for
a
jury
trial
on
whether
or
not
the
person
was
stopped.
but
let's
take
the
time,
the
first
time,
which
is
one
that
i
am
familiar
with,
when
the
person
was
walking
along
a
darkened
road
in
the
nighttime
hours
and
there
had
been
a
series
of
car
clouts
in
the
area,
and
the
person
was
not
wearing
a
raincoat,
although
it
was
a
rainy
night.
it
would
appear
that
he
wasn't
from
the
immediate
neighborhood,
that
he
was
from
outside
the
area;
that
he
was
not
walking
along
the
edge
of
the
street,
that
he
was
walking
out
toward
the
middle,
according
to
the
officer.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
as
far
as...
my
recollection
is
that
the
facts,
those
facts
are
what
the
officer
related
as
connecting
the
person
to
criminal
activity.
middle
of
the
road
walking;
on
a
dark
street
without
any
lights;
might
be
hit;
car
clouts
in
the
area,
might
be
car
clouting;
and
the
fact
that
he--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--that's
it,
yes.
so
those
were
the
facts.
as
i
said
before,
i
think
that
to
get
into
the
specific
facts
and
argue
the
specific
facts
of
these
things
isn't
proper,
since
it
will
go
to
trial
again
on
those
facts.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
that's
true,
that's
true.
but
it
will
go
to
trial
on
that
and
the
good
faith
on
the
officers'
part
certainly
depends
to
a
large
extent
upon
the
facts
surrounding
each
of
the
stops.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
he
did
not,
in
my
reading
of
his
ruling
did
not.
we
are
in
the
process
of
seeking
to
have
the
injunction
lifted
until
this
decision
from
this
court
comes
down.
but
we
have
not
proceeded
on
that
until
following
our
appearance
here.
i
would
like
to
hit
on
the...
or
to
just
mention
the
reasonableness
of
this
type
of
a
stop
before
we
conclude,
because
i
think
that
the
governmental
interest
to
deter
and
detect
crime
is
a
major
societal
interest,
a
weighty
social
objective,
i
think
it
was
stated
in
brown.
and
the
intrusion
of
being
asked
for
identification
this
court
has
characterized
in
bignoni-ponce
and
martinez-fuerte
and
mendenhall
as
being
limited
intrusions
or
modest,
whereas
when
you
ask
somebody
to
assume
the
position
and
be
frisked
that
is
a
serious
or
severe
intrusion
that
can
result
in
great
indignity,
and
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
so
when
you
put
that
on
the
scales
and
you
weigh
the
great
governmental
interest
against
the
minimal
intrusion
of
asking
for
identification,
i
feel
that
it's
fully
justified
under
the
circumstances.
i
feel
that
anybody
at
the
bench,
the
bar
or
in
the
audience
who
was
faced
with
a
situation
where
they
saw
someone
walking
around
their
house
on
public
streets,
where
people
have
a
perfect
right
to,
at
odd
hours,
early
morning
hours,
because
you
were
concerned
or
i
was
concerned,
we
called
the
police,
that
we
would
think
it
was
reasonable
that
they
asked
that
person
what
their
name
was.
i
think
it's
perfectly
reasonable.
now--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--i
still
think
it's
a
valid
safeguarding
tool,
and
i
think
it's
important
that
they
be
allowed
to
do
that,
and
i
think
that
the
concern
of
the
freedom
to
move
has
got
to
be
weighed
against
the
freedom
of
other
people
to
move
also.
and
each
one
interfaces
with
the
other
one...
excuse
me.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
if
you
had
an
absolute
right
to
wander,
you
wouldn't
even
be
able
to
arrest
somebody.
you'd
have...
it'll
lead
to
total
anarchy
if
you
leave
it
to
its
logical
conclusion.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
i
certainly
think
that
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
total
circumstances,
just
as
in
cortez,
the
total
circumstances
play
a
large
role
in
it.
in
cortez
it
was
the
time
of
the
night,
the
position
of
the
car--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--no,
not
unless
there
was...
you
know,
it
was
in
the
daytime
in
an
ohio
city
where
mr.
terry
was
stopped,
and
i
think--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--that's
right.
i
think
it
was
daytime,
and--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--because,
without
any
other
facts,
you
know,
it's
what
prompts
the
stop.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
oh,
no,
no,
no.
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
[laughter]
i'm
sorry
if
i
left
that
impression.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
my
intention
was
to
state
that
a
man
at
high
noon
who
isn't
exhibiting
any
criminal
tendencies
certainly
wouldn't
be
stopped,
or
his
walking
up
and
down
looking
like
he's
looking
for
a
cab.
that's
completely
different.
it's
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
appellant
seems
to
merge
his
lack
of
notice
and
fourth
amendment
rights
together
in
arguing
that
a
person
really
doesn't
know
what
might
constitute
suspicious
behavior.
this
is
true
of
any
arrest.
now,
if
i
or
anyone
else
happens
to
be
dressed
like
a
criminal,
physical
appearances
of
a
criminal--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--well,
the
police
report
comes
in
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
the
criminal
was
dressed
in
a
certain
way,
had
a
certain
physical
appearance--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--meets
the
description,
and
is
driving
a
car
that
was
used
in
a
crime.
to
be
perfectly
innocent...
happened
to
me
once.
you're
stopped.
there's
nothing
wrong,
absolutely
nothing
wrong
there,
and
i
was
not
put
on
notice
that
dressing
that
way,
appearing
that
way
or
driving
in
that
car
was
anything
other
than
completely
innocent.
however,
i
was
stopped.
and
it
can
happen
to
anyone.
and
you
cannot
put
the
onus--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--no.
not
so.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
that's
right.
and
that's...
necessary.
i
identified
myself
and
was
allowed
to
go
on.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
it's
not
necessary.
there's
no
way
you
can
possibly
let
everybody
know
what,
in
any
particular
set
of
circumstances,
is
going
to
be
suspicious
to
a
policeman.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
once
the
policeman
asks
him,
he
has
the
obligation
to
answer
him.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
probable
cause,
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
he's
got
a
good
lawsuit
afterwards.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
for
the
civil
suit.
yes,
he
has
an
obligation
to
answer
because
you
have
an
obligation
under
any
arrest--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--neither
are
cases
of
arrest
always
confined
within
probable
cause
to
arrest.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
for
the
state
of
california.
yes,
sir.
because
otherwise,
all
your
obstruction
of
justice--
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
--the
thing
is...
you're
getting
down
to
the
practicality.
in
a
legal
sense,
no.
but
you're
relying
on
your
police
to
be
imposing
this
code
section
constitutional,
and
anybody
can
do
anything
improperly
is
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
but
certainly,
you
expect
him
to
have
the
articulate
facts.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
certainly.
and
he
probably
would
bring
a
lawsuit
for
false
arrest,
a
civil
suit.
i'd
also
like
to
mention
the
fact
that
what
he's
after
is
a
right
to
anonymity;
not
a
right
to
freedom
of
movement.
and
nothing...
there's
no
constitutional
right
to
anonymity.
and
i
think
it
is
very
imminently
more
reasonable
to
require
identification
of
a
person
than
it
is
to,
in
every
instance...
you
can't
stop
unless
you've
got
a
right
to
pat-down.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
no,
not
without
the
articulable
fact.
mr.
a.
wells
petersen
well,
yes.
under
most
circumstances,
i'd
have
to
agree
with
you,
yes.
but
not
when
you're
found
under
suspicious
circumstances
of
terry.
most
statutes,
by
the
way,
of
this
type
are
city
and
county
ordinances
and
are
not
state
statutes,
and
empirical
data
would
be
impossible
to
develop
because
you
would
have
to
have
identical
law
enforcement
agencies,
identical
societies,
identical
laws,
and
that's
impossible.
there
is
a
duty
not
to
arrest...
not
to
resist
arrest,
even
if
the
rest
is
improper.
and
there
are
obstruction
of
justice
statutes
throughout
this
country
that
would
all
be
held
unconstitutional
if
we
didn't
have
the
standards.
but
i
submit
that
under
the
standards
of
solomon
in
647(e),...
thank
you.
