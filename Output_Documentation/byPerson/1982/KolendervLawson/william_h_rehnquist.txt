h.
rehnquist
but
it
won't
go
to
trial
on
the
question
of
the
respondent's
guilt
or
innocence.
it
just
goes
to
trial,
doesn't
it,
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
officers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding
as
to
the
need
for
the
injunction
issue
in
this
case,
whether
there
was
a
likelihood
that
the
stops
would
recur?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
some
peculiar
rule
that
applies
to
cleveland,
but
not
to
the
rest
of
the
country?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say,
then,
that
a
case
in
which
a
terry
stop
was
made
is
not
reviewable
by
the
courts
because
it's
so
esoteric
they
just
wouldn't
know
anything
about
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
statute
spoke
in
terms
of
probable
cause
and
not
articulable
suspicion?
would
that
affect
your
argument
on
this
point
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
true
of
articulable
suspicion,
too,
isn't
it,
if
you
phrase
it
in
those
terms?
articulable
suspicion
is
some
sort
of
halfway
house
between
probable
cause
and
nothing.
it's
better
than
nothing,
but
not
as
good
as
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
individual
has
any
better
basis
for
making
the
judgment
if
it's
probable
cause?
do
you
think
the
typical
lay
person
really
knows
what
the
components
of
probable
cause
are
any
more
than
they
know
what
the
components
of
articulable
suspicion
are?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it's
not
capable
of
being
applied
in
any
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
terry
gives
you
that
same
sort
of
acceleration
on
the
facts
of
terry,
doesn't
it?
if
you
reach
in
and
find
someone
is
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
and
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
is
a
crime,
all
of
a
sudden
you
do
have
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course.
but--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we
don't
need
counsel
to
inform
us
of
that,
i
don't
think.
but
supposing
in
the
superior
court
of
san
diego
county,
a
prosecution
is
brought
under
this
ordinance,
and
all
the
prosecution
proved
was
that
the
defendant
had
been
stopped
and
asked
for
information,
and
it
was
clear
there
was
not
terry
grounds
for
stopping
the
individual.
wouldn't
the
defendant
be
entitled
to
a
directed
verdict
at
the
close
of
the
prosection--
