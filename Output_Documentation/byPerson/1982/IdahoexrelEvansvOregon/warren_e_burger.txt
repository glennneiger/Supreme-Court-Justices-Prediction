chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
first
this
morning
number
67
original,
idaho
against
oregon.
mr.
attorney
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
master
concluded
that
it
is
simply
an
unknowable
factor,
and
therefore
it
wouldn't
be
a
matter
of
impugning
the
credibility
or
integrity
of
the
witness,
but
simply
a
conclusion
that
the
witness
was
in
outer
space
in
terms
of
giving
an
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
are
coming
into
your
rebuttal
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mackie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
respect,
now,
we
who
are
not
experienced
in
water
matters
may
get
confused
even
about
very
elementary
things,
water
and
fish.
is
there
a
difference
on
the
right
of
a
state
with
respect
to
water
and
the
contents
of
the
water,
on
terms
of
allocation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
is
that
based
on
need?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
my
question
and
see
if
it
will
clarify
some
of
these
things
for
me.
your
friend
in
his
argument
was
emphasizing
several
times
the
origin
of
these
fish,
that
is,
they
were
hatched,
born
in
the
state
of
idaho,
and
then
left,
and
when
they
left
they
were
about
the
size
of
a
large
sardine,
but
when
they
come
back
they
are
15,
16,
17
pounds.
you
both
agreed
on
that.
now,
i
take
it
that
his
complaint
about
the
master's
findings
is
that
the
master
has
not
given
sufficient
consideration
to
the
place
of
origin
of
these
fish.
idaho
is
asserting
a
special
right
in
the
fish
which
originate
there.
now,
you
challenge
that,
i
take
it?
or
what
is
your
view
about
the
place
of
origin?
how
important
is
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
for
your
timing
rely
on
the
supplementary
signal
there.
this
one
seems
to
be
out
of
order.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
a
few
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
going
to
respond
with
some
figures
for
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
