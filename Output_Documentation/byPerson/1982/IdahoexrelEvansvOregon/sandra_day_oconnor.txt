what
kind
of
a
formula
is
used
to
protect
the
indian
rights?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
in
the
nature
of
an
escapement
number?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
didn't
the
master
say
you
could
not
tell
how
many
idaho
had
contributed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
of
the
fish
that
you
claim
idaho
is
supplying
are
hatchery
fish?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
be
an
optimum
escapement,
how
many?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
years
have
there
been
that
many
available
for
an
optimum
escapement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
since
the
seventies.
are
there
enough
for
an
optimum
escapement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
jones,
to
get
one
fish
to
idaho,
it
requires
that
two
die
en
route,
two
others
die
to
get
one
through
to
idaho?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
is
one
to
two
now--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
get
one
to
idaho.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
is
your
position
that
it
is
better
to
prevent
people
downstream
from
catching
those
fish,
that
we
should
force
them
to
die
rather
than
be
caught
and
used
to
get
idaho's
fish
upstream?
is
that
basically
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mackie,
do
you
concede
that
idaho
is
entitled
under
some
theory
to
an
equitable
share
of
the
fish?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
concede
that
idaho
has
an
equitable
right
to
some
share
of
the
fish?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
just
in
the
abstract,
does
idaho
have
an
equitable
right
to
a
share
of
anadromous
fish?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
master
determined
that
idaho
was
entitled
to
an
equitable
share,
did
he
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
didn't
take
exception
to
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mackie,
assume
for
a
moment
that
a
state
like
idaho
is
able
to
prove
a
need.
then
what
formula
do
you
think
is
appropriate
to
ensure
that
idaho
gets
an
equitable
share?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
know
you
don't,
but
i
am
asking,
you
know,
if
the
court
were
faced
with
a
situation
where
they
had
to
devise
something,
what
do
you
think
is
fair?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
a
low
year,
is
it
to
everybody's
interest
to
let
a
large
escapement
go
across
so
that
there
will
be
more
fish
in
the
future?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
there
be
then
a
minimum
escapement
requirement
so
that
the
fish
are
perpetuated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
assuming
all
the
hatchery
fish
are
attributed
to
idaho.
