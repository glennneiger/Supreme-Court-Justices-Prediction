mr.
edward
b.
mackie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
starting
position
that
the
state
of
idaho
takes
is
to
assert
that
the
master
in
some
way
restricted
the
record
they
had
an
opportunity
to
make.
that
assertion
is
simply
false.
the
master
did
not
restrict
the
record
which
the
plaintiffs
had
an
opportunity
to
make
in
this
suit.
the
master's
report
and
statistics
indicates
run
sizes
from
1956
on.
the
record
has
material
reflecting
runs
that
are
prior
to
1956.
what
the
master
did
was,
having
heard
the
testimony
on
the
question
of
indispensability,
which
resulted
in
the
report,
and
then
subsequently
when
the
matter
was
remanded
to
the
master
for
proceeding
upon
the
merits,
took
the
testimony,
the
exhibits,
and
the
arguments,
and
from
that
looked
at
the
totality
and
could
see
the
marked
changes
that
have
occurred
in
the
columbia
river
and
snake
system
as
a
result
of
the
dams
and
the
impact
on
the
fishery,
and
having
that
knowledge
before
him,
indicated
that
if
the
court
was
to
prescribe
a
decree
to
address
an
allocation
as
sought
by
idaho,
one
should
look
at
what
the
realities
of
life
are
now,
to
address
that
decree,
rather
than
to
address
a
decree
on
the
basis
of
what
may
have
occurred
in
the
1940's,
fifties,
or
sixties.
so,
the
record
is
in
fact
full.
it
is
not
restricted
to
the
most
recent
period.
on
the
presentation
of
argument
for
the
indispensability
question,
one
of
the
contentions
for
indispensability
was
that
most
of
these
dams
on
this
system
are
owned
and
operated
by
the
federal
government
or
licensees
of
the
federal
government,
and
therefore
the
united
states
for
that
reason
was
an
indispensable
party,
because
its
control
of
the
flow
of
water
through
those
dams
and
the
turbines
as
contrasted
with
spill
had
a
direct
impact
on
the
availability
of
fish.
idaho's
response
was
that
they
accept
the
dams,
they
accept
the
loss,
and
therefore
the
united
states
was
not
indispensable
upon
that
theory.
this
court
in
the
opinion
remanding
it
back
to
the
master
acknowledged
that
position
taken
by
idaho.
now,
it
turns
back
to
this
court.
they
are
taking
the
posture
that
one
should
in
some
way
apportion
the
loss
that
occurs
by
upstream
passage
of
the
fish
rather
than
idaho
being
the
area
where
the
fishery
takes
place
after
the
fish
have
gone
through
eight
dams
on
its
upward
matter.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
your
honor,
our
position
on
that
is
that
idaho's
claim
is
novel,
it
is
unique,
it
has
no
precedent
in
terms...
in
any
case
law
nor
any
that
they
could
develop
for
having
"a
right"
here
at
all.
the
court
has
found
that
the
issue
is
in
fact
justiciable,
so
that
it
can
be
considered
by
a
court
for
relief.
we
therefore
believe
that
if
there
is
any
right,
it
is
an
equitable
right,
and
that
equitable
right
comes
in--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--in
terms...
i
believe
that
idaho
could
present
in
an
appropriate
circumstance
a
need
to
have
some
protection
which
would
give
rise--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--your
honor,
in
the
abstract,
my
response
is
that
the
right
comes
into
being
because
of
the
need
to
create
it,
and
therefore
if
in
fact
they
have
demonstrated
the
need,
that
gives
rise
to
the
equitable
right.
the
equitable
right
does
not
exist
free-standing,
separate,
and
apart
from
any--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--your
honor,
what
our
position
was
is
that
idaho
having
failed
to
prove
need
for
any
protection,
it
is
not
appropriate
therefore
to
label
that
they
have
a
right
at
the
outset.
if
they--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--yes.
you
are--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--your
honor,
the
master
addressing
that
point
found
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
dismiss
the
action
without
having
it
proceed
to
the
merits
to
determine
whether
there
might
be
a
right
that
would
give
rise.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
and
that
is
what
this
court
affirmed.
do
you
disagree
with
that
judgment?
no,
i
do
not
disagree
with
that
judgment.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
but
it
means--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--that's
the
point
that
we
indicated,
that
the
master,
by
having
concluded
that
there
was
no
need
for
any
relief,
should
not
therefore
recognize
that
there
is
an
underlying
right.
until
the
master
finds
that
there
is
a
need,
there
should
not
be
a
recognition
of
a
right.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
we
did
not
take
exception
to
the
master's
conclusion
of
dismissal
of
the
action.
the...
i--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--excuse
me.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
i
believe
that
if
the
downstream
states
completely
pre-empted
the
entire
fishery--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--idaho
would
be
in
a
position
of
claiming
some
relief
from
the--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--they
would,
under
the
general
approach
of
the
water
rights
cases
for
original
jurisdiction,
this
court
would
in
fact
condone
the
fashioning
of
some
relief
to
protect
idaho
from
that
pre-emptive
action
by
the
downstream
states.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
right.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
i
agree,
your
honor.
there
is...
the
master
concluded
no
relief.
and
all
we
are
saying
is
that
actually
when
one
"says
there
is
a
right"
the
general
reaction
is,
therefore
"there
should
be
a
remedy",
and
that
when
one
is
looking
to
the
recognition
of
something
which
is
new
and
novel,
as
is
here
presented,
it
is
prudent
to
say
that
we
will
try
to
describe
what
the
nature
of
that
may
be
when
there
is
a
need
for
some
relief.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
in
water
rights
traditionally
those
adjudications
have
tried
to
resolve
and
harmonize
the
respective
rights
held
by
individuals
and
entities
in
varying
states.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
that
is
based
historically,
when
you
are
dealing
with
two
states
both
of
whom
have
a
right
of
prior
appropriation
doctrine,
of
merging
those
two
systems.
when
you
deal
with
a
state
which
has
raparian
rights
and
appropriation
rights,
trying
to
merge
the
two
systems.
but
generally
those
cases
have
recognized
on
a
historical
priority
the
older
established
right
provided
it
has
not
been
abandoned.
now,
more
recently,
this
court
in
the
colorado-new
mexico
case
issued
in
december
seems
to
put
a
more
current
re-examination
of
what
rights
are
being
exercised
that
have
been
historical
to
determine
whether
some
of
those
rights
may
be
withdrawn
back
and
transferred.
in
that
case,
all
of
the
water
had
effectively
been
previously
appropriated
to
new
mexico,
and
the
claim
was
for
water
in
colorado.
the
master
ordered
a
withdrawal
from
the
new
mexico
portion
and
given
to
colorado.
this
court
remanded
it
to
the
master
to
make
further
findings
because
it
was
not
satisfied
that...
of
the
reasons
for
the
transfer,
and
the
court
had
various
opinions
on
it.
but
it
does
say
that
you
look
more
at
a
current
use
rather
than
the
historical
approach
that
has
been
more
common
in
water
right.
it
is
to
look
at
what
has
been
the
historical
pattern
of
the
use
and
recognize
those
historical
patterns
when
they
can
be
made
compatible.
but
in
the
water
cases,
there
are
two
very
important
things
related
to
this.
one,
the
water
cases
have
traditionally
refused
to
grant
a
state...
a
preferred
position
to
the
state
of
origin.
this
court
reaffirmed
that
refusal
in
the
colorado-new
mexico
case
at
footnote
13.
that
same
approach
has
been
in
the
nebraska-wyoming
case.
idaho's
claim
here
is
"a
state
of
origin"
it
has.
in
water
right,
that
does
not
give
a
preferred
position.
second,
in
water,
the
state
of
origin
is
in
fact
where
the
total
volume
as
it
exits
the
state
has
in
fact
been
formed.
the
amount
of
water
as
it
flows
across
the
border
is
a
certain
quantity
of
water,
and
then
it
exits
the
state.
in
this
situation,
idaho
is
the
place
of
birth,
and
those
fish
which
are
born
there
leave
idaho
when
they
weigh
between
one-tenth
of
a
pound
and
one-fortieth
of
a
pound
when
they
leave
idaho.
when
they
return,
and
idaho
is
here
asserting
basically
a
claim
and
a
preferred
position
for
harvest,
those
fish
average
about
15
pounds,
which
is
a
factor
of
150
to
600
times
the
weight
of
when
these
fish
left,
and
that
growth
and
that
weight
gain
all
occurs
outside
the
state
of
idaho.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it
occurs
in
river,
it
occurs
on
the
coastal
waters,
in
alaska,
in
the
ocean.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
my
point
is
that
they
are
asserting
a
preferred
right
by
virtue
of
this
fish
which
weighs
basically
a
tenth
of
a
pound
leaving
it
to
a
preferred
position
for
any
of
the
adult
fish
that
return,
they
should
have
the
first
priority
for
harvest.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
certainly.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
no,
the
percentage
in
terms
of
the
run
is
not
affected,
but
the
question
is
is
what
the
interest
is
of
the
originating
state.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
your
honor,
the
position
by
idaho
is
that
if
a
run
by
virtue
of
what
happens
to
the
other
components
is...
100
percent
of
the
run
originates
from
idaho,
then
they
are
entitled
to
100
percent
of
the
harvest,
with
no
harvest
permitted
by
the
downstream
states.
that
is
the
idaho
formula.
and
on
one
of
their
documents
in
their
brief,
they
identify
one
of
the
steelhead
year
runs
as
being
98
percent
of
idaho
origin.
under
their
formula,
therefore,
they
are
entitled
to
98
percent
of
that
run.
washington
is
2
percent.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
ninety-eight
percent
of
the
98
percent.
what
idaho
does...
excuse
me.
on
upstream...
we
are
referring
here
to
upstream
stocks.
those
are
fish
which
go
above
bonneville
dam,
which
is
the
first
of
the
eight
dams
on
the
columbia
and
the
main
portion
of
the
snake.
those
fish
as
they
cross
that
dam
are
destined
for
a
multitude
of
different
locations,
some
of
those
in
various
tributaries,
main
stem
columbia,
and
also
the
snake
river.
idaho
takes
the
posture
that
those
fish
which
come
from
the
snake
river,
the
boundary
line
with
washington
and
idaho,
are,
by
their
definition,
"idaho
origin
stocks".
they
take
that
percentage
and
they
say,
okay,
if
the
entire
run
is
100
fish,
and
if
60
come
from
that
idaho
component,
they
are
entitled
to--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--idaho's--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--yes,
but
idaho's
posture
is
that
you
put
the
restrictions
upon
the
fisheries
below
the
first
dam.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
idaho
is
saying
that--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
no.
excuse
me.
what
they
are
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
if
the
run...
if
the
run--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--they
get
98
percent
of
98
percent,
which
means--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--no,
your
honor.
they
say
in
terms...
98
percent
of
"the
harvestable
fish".
they
are
not
talking
about
above
the
dam.
and
they
are
further...
therefore,
under
their
theory
of
98
percent,
washington
would
be,
and
oregon,
entitled
to
take
two
fish
from
that
run
out
of
the
100.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
that's
right,
and
further,
if
washington
took
those
two
fish
below
the
dam
and
the
100
was
computed
at
the
dam,
we
would
not
be
able
to
take
two
because
we
would
have
to
take
one
to
factor
in
for
the
loss
that
goes
on
to
idaho.
that
is
their
position.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
this
case
lends
itself
to
any
formula,
because--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--what
i
am
saying...
excuse
me,
your
honor...
is
that
i
cannot
in
terms
give
you
a
formula
because
the
number
of
fish
is
a
factor
of
what
is
the
division
of
the
runs.
what
portion
in
turns
would
be
going
to
idaho
contrasted
with
the
other
areas.
the
smaller
the
idaho
total
of
the
whole...
for
example,
in
their
brief,
their
reply
brief,
they
have
identified
what
they
designate
to
be
the
percentage
interest
that
occurs
of
idaho
in
a
given
year,
and
those
are
not
50
percent,
they
range
over
the
map.
for
example,
with
reference
to
summer
chinook,
in
the
most
recent
year,
14
percent
of
the
total
run
is
of
idaho
origin.
the
year
before,
10
percent;
33
percent
before
that.
the
smaller
the
idaho
portion
of
a
harvestable
total
of
mixed
stocks,
one
has
to
therefore,
if
you
preserve
a
catch
for
idaho,
avoid
catching
a
substantial
portion
of
the
non-idaho
stocks,
because
those
stocks
are
intermixed
in
the
lower
river,
and
therefore
if
you
are
harvesting
those
fish
which
are
spring
chinooks
that
are
destined
for
places
other
than
idaho,
if
idaho
has
a
set
formula
amount,
you
then
have
to
refrain
from
harvesting
fish
you
otherwise
would
harvest.
now,
conversely--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--the
parties
in
this
suit
stipulated
in
the
pretrial
order
in
number
16
that
all
three
states
are
interested
in
protecting
and
enhancing
the
upriver
spring
chinook,
summer
chinook,
summer
steelhead
runs
originating
in
the
snake
river
and
its
tributaries,
and
the
downstream
states
consistently
try
to
manage
those
runs
so
that
the
returns
are
being
made
to
perpetuate
that
species--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--for
the
minimum
escapement
requirement,
it
is
interesting
that
counsel
made
reference
to
the
northwest
power
council
as
being
the
savior
coming
upon
the
horizon
for
these
fish
runs.
what
that
council
recommended
or
stated
in
a
document
which
was
lodged
by
idaho
with
this
court
on
friday
was
that,
"the
council
has
examined
these
positions.
"
--this
is
the
positions
of
the
various
fish
agencies
and
utilities
as
to
what
goals
should
be
for
fish
escapement...
"carefully,
and
does
not
believe
that
the
information
now
available
is
adequate
to
support
a
final
decision
on
goals,
and
they
therefore
have
prescribed
that
all
of
those
entities
are
required
to
report
their
proposals
by
april
15,
1984.
"
that
is
found
in
section
201,
pages
2.1
and
2.2.

edward
b.
mackie
excuse
me?

mackie
to
the
pacific
northwest
power
council,
which
was
created
by
the
1980
pacific
northwest
power
and
conservation
act.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
sohappy's
status,
your
honor,
is
that
two
of
the
four
tribes
indicated
that
they
no
longer
wished
to
proceed
with
the
five-year
agreement,
and
that
notification
was
given
a
little
over
a
year
ago.
the
district
court
is
nevertheless
continuing
to
provide
for
the
management
of
the
fishery
based
on
the
five-year
agreement.
they
did
it
last
year,
and
the
court
is
continuing
to
do
it
this
year.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
if
the
parties
are
unable
to
reach
a
replacement
agreement,
then
it
would
appear
that
further
litigation
is
the
only
alternative.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
the
decree
might
or
might
not,
your
honor,
set
a

escapement.
mr.
edward

yes.
with

agreement,
the
traditional

of

on
an
indian
fishery
have
been
how
many
fish
are
necessary
for
conservation
and
what
should
be
the
division
of
the
harvest.
so
the
agreement
addressed
both
points.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
when
the
courts
have
entered
decrees
with
reference
to
quantifying
the
indian
fishing
share,
they
have
done
so
with
reference
to
the
harvestable
portion,
but
have
not
made
part
of
their
decree
what
is
required
for
the
purposes
of
escapement,
leaving
that
to
the
ongoing
management
of
the
respective
parties.
so,
what
the
court
might
do
if
litigation
is
required
there
is
up
in
air.
further,
that
five-year
agreement,
counsel
refers
to
the
40-60
sharing
of
upriver
spring
chinook.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
no,
they
are
not,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
oregon
was
the
original
party
in
sohappy
in
1969.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
as
a
state.
in
1974,
the
court
indicated
an
intention
to
change
its
decree
because
the
'69
degree
in
sohappy
was
a
fair
share.
in
1974,
in
light
of
the
changing
in
the
impact,
washington
moved
to
intervene
and
was
made
a
party.
so
washington
and
oregon
were
a
party
in
'74.
the
district
court
then
changed
its
decree
from
fair
share
to
50
percent.
that
was
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
in
1976
said
that
you
have
not
considered
the
appropriate
factual
matters
in
changing
your
decree.
we
hereby
set
aside
your
setting
50
percent
and
remand
back
for
further
proceedings
to
determine
the
appropriate
share.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
then
there
was
an
agreement
executed
in
1977
which
provided
for
a
five-year
period.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
no,
your
honor,
they
have
not.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
i
believe
that
the
place
of
origin
is
simply
one
of
a
large
number
of
factors
that
go
into
the
consideration
of
making
an
allocation
if
an
allocation
is
to
be
made.
just
as
it
is
in
terms
of
water
allocations
between
states,
the
point
of
origin
is
not
the
determinative
factor.
you
look
to
the
historical
uses,
whether
there
is
wastage,
the
whole
combination,
for
trying
to
harmonize
for
an
allocation.
idaho
only
wants
to
look
at
one
element,
which
is
the
element
of
the
point
of
origin.
we
contend
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
totality
in
terms
of
the
historical
patterns,
the
industry,
what
the
impact,
the
economic,
and
so
forth.
what
the
master
in
terms
looked
at
here
is
taking
idaho's
posture
as
to
the
harvest
historically,
from
1962
to
1980,
where
counsel
makes
reference
to
the
division
that
occurred.
now,
their
own
document,
when
looked
at
in
their
brief
at
pages
27
through
30,
reveals
that
from
1962
to
1980,
idaho
harvested
of
these
three
species
373,000
fish.
during
that
same
period,
when
you
take
the
washington
and
oregon
harvest
and
then
factor
it
downward
to
reflect...
in
other
words,
if
washington
harvested
and
oregon
two
fish
in
the
lower
river,
that
would
not
reflect
on
two
fish
even
being
made
available
to
idaho.
so
the
fish
which
in
theory
would
have
reached
idaho
had
there
not
been
a
harvest
was
558,362,
which
means
during
that
period
idaho
received
40
percent
of
the
harvest
of
these
stocks,
and
the
two
downstream
states
combined
60
percent.
in
the
most
recent
seven-year
period,
1977
through
1980,
which
reflects
the
installation
not
only
of
the
dams
but
the
increase
in
the
number
of
turbines
on
the
snake
river
from
three
to
24,
reflects
in
terms
the
impact
totally
barring
access
to
elements
of
the
snake
river
with
the
brownley,
oxlow,
and
hell's
canyon
dam,
the
1971
impact
of
the
dorsvach
dam
on
the
meka
tributary
of
the
clearwater
for
production
in
idaho,
with
all
of
those,
during
that
period--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--no,
hell's
canyon
is
a
complete
blockage,
and
therefore
that
series
completely
blocked
that
entire
area
of
the
snake
river
to
any
further
fish
production.
on...
the
others
do
have
ladders,
but
the
problem
of
passage,
your
honor,
is
both
upstream
and
downstream.
now,
during
this
most
recent
seven-year
period,
idaho
harvested
of
these
three
species
56,500
fish.
washington
and
oregon,
when
you
take
the
catch
which
was
27,000
and
factor
it
downward
for
the
mortality,
reflects
15,953
fish
that
had
been
caught
zero
would
have
been
available
in
idaho
for
harvest.
that
is
a
sharing
of
the
harvest
of
78
percent
for
idaho
and
22
percent
for
washington
and
oregon.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
your
honor,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
at
this
point
we
are
not
challenging
those
numbers.
what
those
numbers
show
is,
when
one
looks
in
hindsight
on
a
lag
basis,
there
is
an
amazing
counting
system
that
takes
place
in
this
watershed,
and
when
you
look
back
in
time,
you
can
do
all
kinds
of
marvelous
things
by
using
your
calculator
and
your
computer.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
yes.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
on
the
basis
of
what
is
in
the
record,
i
believe
these
are
fairly
accurate,
your
honor,
but
what
i
am
emphasizing
is
that
these
numbers
make
one
look
and
say,
it
is
very
easy
to
compute.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
what
the
master
was
indicating
is
that
what
these
very
numbers
indicate
is
what
when
you
are
trying
to
manage
a
run
during
a
given
year,
they
are
radically
different
one
year
from
another
on
a
wide
variety
of
actions
that
you
can't
tell
here.
now,
it
is
also
in
terms
of
idaho's
figures
we
should
point
out
that
on
page
29
of
idaho's
brief
they
report
the
downstream
catch
as
total
for
the
period
1962
to
1980
as
being
870,484.
that
is
clearly
a
typographical
error,
because
the
total
is
370,000,
a
slight
change
of
a
half
a
million
off
of
that
figure.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
that
is
on
page
29
of
the
idaho
brief,
under
the
total
that
they
have
for
a
column.
it
is
off
by
half
a
million.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
an
original
action,
the
standard
for
relief
is
that
the
plaintiff
seeking
relief
must
have
an
injury
of
serious
magnitude
and
must
clearly
and
fully
prove
it.
they
must
prove
it
and
establish
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
this
is
the
standard
which
has
been
enunciated
by
justice
holmes
in
the
missouri
versus
illinois
decision,
in
new
york
versus
new
jersey,
more
recently
in
colorado
versus
new
mexico.
this
court
in
the
last
proceedings
at
444
u.s.
380
identified
it
as
adversely
and
unfairly
affecting
idaho.
the
master,
who
has
heard
and
examined
all
of
the
testimony,
all
of
the
exhibits,
which
are
numerous,
all
of
the
briefing
and
arguments,
has
found
that
idaho
has
failed
to
sustain
that
burden,
that
idaho
not
only
failed,
but
the
master
found
that
oregon
and
washington
have
in
fact
acted
in
good
faith
in
their
management
of
this
fishery.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
master's
report
should
be
accepted.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
hell's
canyon
is
a
complete
blockage,
and--
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
--fish
cannot
traverse
in
either
direction.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
no,
the
height
of
those
dams
and
the
way
that
they
are
designed
for
oxbow,
brownley,
and
hell's
canyon,
those
are
permanent
blockages
to
that
entire
basin
for
fish
production.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
and
also
in
terms
for
tributaries
which
go
into
oregon,
which
idaho
is
claiming...
because
the
hatchery
is
put
into
idaho.
mr.
edward
b.
mackie
excuse
me.
the
tributaries
flow
from
oregon
into
the
snake
river.
