mr.
jim
jones
thanks,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case
idaho
seeks
apportionment
of
the
fish
it
contributes
to
three
columbia
rivers...
columbia
river
runs
of
anadromous
fish,
spring
and
summer
chinook
salmon,
and
steelhead
trout.
we
have
historically
contributed
about
half
of
the
fish
to
each
of
the
upriver
runs
of
these
fish,
but
have
not
received
a
fair
share
of
the
harvest.
from
1962
until
1980,
the
defendants
took
83
percent
of
the
harvest.
they
took
of
summer...
of
spring
chinook.
they
took
75
percent
of
the
harvest
of
summer
chinook,
and
58
percent
of
the
harvest
of
steelhead.
the
master,
however,
reached
a
conclusion
which
is
not
supported
by
the
record
because
he
confined
idaho
to
a
straightjacket
of
proof,
a
narrow
five-year
period
from
1975
to
1980,
the
period
after
the
suit
was
originally
filed.
he
disregarded
a
history
of
disproportionate
sharing
of
idaho
origin
fish,
as
i
have
just
outlined,
the
very
evidence
which
we
believe
this
court
wanted
in
the
original
decision
issued
in
1981.
he
chose
a
narrow,
unrepresentative
time
frame
of
runs
depressed
by
dams
and
overfishing
by
the
defendants,
when
there
was
no
significant
harvest
of
fish
available.
the
only
significant
harvest
was
by
the
defendants
in
1977,
and
it
was
on
the
summer...
on
the
spring
chinook
run.
at
that
time,
even
though
there
were
not
enough
fish
to
meet
the
escapement
that
the
defendants
had
agreed
on
with
the
indians
in
the
five-year
plan,
the
defendants
conducted
a
downstream
harvest,
and
during
that
year
they
took
78
percent
of
the
harvest
of
spring
chinook,
and
that
was
during
the
five-year
period
that
the
master
actually
did
consider.
idaho
did
harvest
some
fish
during
those
years,
but
they
were
harvests
that
were
conducted
in
the
hatchery
areas
on
surplus
fish
that
were
not
needed
for
spawning
requirements.
the
master
did
not
take
into
account
the
massive
effort
that
was
just
getting
under
way
to
restore
these
runs
to
their
former
numbers
so
that
they
would
once
again
be
harvestable.
the
facts
are
that
the
runs
are
being
restored
through
existing
hatchery
efforts
in
the
three
states.
they
are
going
to
be
restored
additionally
under
the
lower
snake
compensation
plan
which
contemplates
nine
new
hatcheries.
about
three
or
four
of
those
are
presently
on
line,
and
others
are
in
the
works.
under
the
northwest
electric
power
planning
and
conservation
act,
a
tremendous
effort
is
just
getting
under
way
to
restore
the
damage
caused
by
the
lower
columbia
dams,
and
that
is
going
to
have
an
effect,
because
it
is
going
to
be
implemented
starting
immediately.
granting
relief
to
idaho
will
not
be
in
vain,
because
passage
mortality
losses
upstream
are
such
now
that
renewed
runs
will
get
to
idaho.
an
allocation
formula
can
be
made
using
existing
methodology
and
formulas
that
the
defendants
use
each
year
already
in
making
allocations
of
fish
for
the
indians
under
their
five-year
plan.
it
is
not
going
to
be
that
much
more
difficult
to
take
a
share
of
the
non-treaty
fishery,
the
non-treaty
harvestable
surplus,
and
set
it
aside
for
idaho,
so
that
we
can
share
in
the
fish
that
we
contribute
to
these
runs.
the
indians
found
that
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
get
a
court
decreed
allocation
of
fish,
because
they
are
in
the
same
position
that
we
are.
we
are
end
users.
in
other
words,
the
defendants
fish
below
both
us
and
the
indians.
they
can
take
the
fish.
we
have
no
control
over
them.
and
it
was
apparent
to
the
indians
that
they
needed
the
protection
of
a
court
decree,
and
we
believe
that
we
do,
too.
mr.
jim
jones
in
the
sorhappy
case,
the
federal
district
court
said
that
the
indians
were
to
get
50
percent
of
the
harvestable
surplus.
then
the
parties
agreed
on
a
five-year
plan,
starting
in
1977...
it
just
terminated
last
year...
whereby
an
escapement
of
120,000
fish
over
bonneville
was
agreed
on.
the
indians
were
then
to
get
a
certain
amount,
and
it
is
in
the
formula
in
the
five-year
plan
for
ceremonial
and
subsistence
fishers.
mr.
jim
jones
it
is
after
the
escapement
is
met.
then
the
fish
are
shared
on
a
percentage
basis.
the
indians
get
40
percent
above
the
escapement
and
above
the
ceremonial
fishery.
the
defendants
get
60
percent.
so
it
is
on
a
percentage
basis.
and
that
is
fair
to
all
parties,
and
that
is
what
we
are
basically
after
here.
i
would
like
to
give
you
a
brief
background
on--
mr.
jim
jones
--the
formula
that
we
have
laid
out
is
essentially
at
pages
81
and
82
of
our
brief,
and
we
are
saying
that
you
go
one
step
beyond
the
five-year
plan,
and
that
you
take
the
60
percent
of
the
non-treaty
fishery
and
slice
off
an
allocation
for
idaho.
we
are
saying
that
with
regard--
mr.
jim
jones
--not
yet
determined.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
of
that
60
percent,
you
use
existing
methodology
and
formulas
to
find
out
how
much
idaho
contributed.
if
idaho
contributed,
say,
40
percent
to
that
60
percent,
then
you
take
that
40
percent
and
give
idaho
40
percent
of
it
and
give
the
defendant
60
percent.
in
other
words,
we
are
willing
to
share
the
fish
that
we
contribute.
mr.
jim
jones
the
master
indicated
that,
but
the
unrebutted
testimony
by
idaho's
experts
was
that
you
could
determine
it,
and
that
unrebutted
testimony
was
based
on
formulas
that
the
defendants
have
devised.
and
apparently
the
master
did
not
understand
those
formulas,
but
we
are
willing
to
live
with
them.
mr.
jim
jones
well,
we
are
saying
that
if
it
is
not
inherently
incredible,
if
it
is
not
contradicted,
if
people
don't
punch
holes
on
it,
if
it
is
not
inherently
incredible,
he
has
to
live
with
it,
we
think.
mr.
jim
jones
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
he
did
not
say
it
was
unknowable,
and
possibly
it
could
be,
but
historically
the
runs
have
been
50
percent
contributed
by
idaho,
and
that
is
recognized
by
the
experts
for
washington,
oregon,
and
idaho,
and
fish
counts
are
kept,
so
that
you
can
find
out
certainly
a
year
afterwards
what
the
run
was,
and
what--
mr.
jim
jones
--we
include
hatchery
fish
in
all
the
calculations.
mr.
jim
jones
pardon?
mr.
jim
jones
well,
because
this
court,
i
believe,
recognized
in
the
washington
fishing
vessel
case...
i
believe
it
was
that
case...
that
hatcheries
are
there
primarily
to
compensate
for
damages
caused
by
the
dams,
and
the
principle
has
been
recognized
with
respect
to
the
indians,
and
it
should
be
recognized
with
respect
to
us,
and
those
hatcheries
are
apportioned,
like
under
the
lower
snake
compensation
plan,
those
hatcheries
are
apportioned
to
compensate,
they
are
distributed
to
compensate
for
the
damages
that
were
caused
by
the
dams.
we
didn't
put
the
dams
there.
we
didn't
put
those
dams
there
that
caused
our
fish
to
die.
mr.
jim
jones
but--
mr.
jim
jones
--it
is
just
like
the
fellow
that
goes
out
and
gets
mowed
down
on
the
street.
he
didn't
get
mowed
down--
mr.
jim
jones
--no,
but--
mr.
jim
jones
--but
when
he
is
compensated--
mr.
jim
jones
--idaho
power
put
some
of
them
in.
mr.
jim
jones
the
federal
government
put
some
of
them
in.
idaho
put
some
of
them
in.
mr.
jim
jones
we
have
funded
the
mccall
hatchery
in
mccall,
idaho.
mr.
jim
jones
there
are
eight
hatcheries
in
operation
in
idaho.
mr.
jim
jones
idaho
has
financed
one.
the
others
were
given
by
way
of
compensation
for
dams
that
we
didn't
place
there.
in
other
words,
they
are
just
making
up,
they
are
mitigating
for
the
damages
occasioned
to
us
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
were
placed
there.
we
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with...
and
they
are
mitigating.
they
are
compensating.
mr.
jim
jones
presently,
about
30
to
50
percent
of
the
spring
chinook
in
the
runs
are
hatchery
fish.
the
rest
are
wild
fish.
and
about
50
to
60
percent
of
the
steelhead
are
hatchery
fish.
mr.
jim
jones
the
same
amount
that
the--
mr.
jim
jones
--the
120,000...
well,
the
120,000,
but
you
have
to
include
the
indian
catch,
so
it
would
have
to
be
somewhere
over
120,000.
but
that
is
what
we
talk
about
when
we
talk
about
an
escapement.
it
is
the
number
over
bonneville
less
the
indian
catch.
mr.
jim
jones
all
of
it.
mr.
jim
jones
all
of
it.
you
can't
fish
on
a
minimum
escapement.
mr.
jim
jones
well,
we
would
have
to
get
120,000
fish
over
the
dam
plus
the
indian
catch--
mr.
jim
jones
--and
plus
our
share.
mr.
jim
jones
that's
correct.
if
we're
going
to
continue
the
runs,
we've
got
to
have
at
least
that
many.
mr.
jim
jones
well,
they
would
get
40
percent
of
the
harvestable
surplus.
let's
say
that
there
were
180,000
fish
going
over--
mr.
jim
jones
--right,
the
defendants
do
that
every
year.
mr.
jim
jones
well,
no,
there
are
30,000
fish
under
their
plan
that
have
to
go
upriver.
the
defendants
can
take
a
certain
amount
of
those,
a
maximum
of
7,500--
mr.
jim
jones
--above
bonneville
when
you
have
between
120,000
and
150,000.
mr.
jim
jones
and
then
above
the
150,000
you
have
your
harvestable
surplus,
and
that
is
the
amount
that
is
allocated
out
to
the
treaty
and
non-treaty
fisheries.
mr.
jim
jones
an
optimum
escapement
would
be
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
150,000
plus
the
indian
fisheries.
and
that
would
provide
for
maximum
sustained
yield,
and
essentially
that
is
what
they
are
shooting
for.
mr.
jim
jones
prior
to
the
1970's,
there
would
have
been
certainly
enough
for
an
optimum
escapement.
i
think--
mr.
jim
jones
--prior
to
the
1970's...
i
believe
that
for
the
first
three
years
of
the
seventies,
there
would
have
been
enough.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
interesting
that
when
we
had
seven
dams
on
line
in
the
system,
when
the
mortality
rates
had
been
fairly
well
established
at
about
two
fish
for
each
one
that
reached
idaho
through
the
entire
system,
so
you
lose
a
maximum
of
one
fish
as
they
are
coming
up
the
river
for
one
that
you
get,
at
a
time
when
we
had
that
situation
existing
starting
in
1970,
we
had
two
of
the
record
runs
of
fish
in
the
spring
chinook
runs.
mr.
jim
jones
the
last
dam
was
put
in
in
1975,
but
it
did
not
add--
mr.
jim
jones
--that's
the
lower
granite
dam.
it
did
not
add
significantly
to
the
mortality,
because
measures
were
incorporated
in
that
dam
to
make
sure
that
the
fish
could
get
up
the
ladders.
so
it
did
not
add
very
much
to
the
mortality
rate.
mr.
jim
jones
downstream,
mortality
is
a
more
difficult
situation.
but
they
have
had
good
success
with
the
screening,
and
one
of
the
things...
one
of
the
things
in
the
lower
snake
compensation
plan
and
the
columbia
river
basin
plan,
a
copy
of
which
has
just
come
to
our
attention,
and
it
has
been
lodged
with
the
court,
a
copy
provided
to
counsel,
that
plan
is
designed
to
either
transport
fish
around
the
dams
on
their
downstream
migration
or
to
properly
screen
the
turbines
so
that
the
won't
have
the
mortalities
that
we've
had.
that
has
been
the
sticking
point,
and
that
is
really
what
the
problem
is
with
the
narrow
constrained
time
frame
that
the
master
used.
he
used
a
time
frame
where
we
were
suffering
yet
from
overfishing
by
the
defendants
in
previous
years.
the
runs
were
suffering
from
those
strains
caused
to
it.
they
were
suffering
from
the
upstream
and
downstream
mortality
from
the
dams.
but
during
that
five-year
period
we
didn't
take
into
account
all
of
the
massive
effort
that
is
being
made
and
going
to
be
made
to
affect
those
upstream
and
downstream
mortalities,
so
we
have
an
artificial
period
of
time.
mr.
jim
jones
no.
with
regard
to
spring
chinook,
one
or
less
have
to
die
to
get
one
to
idaho,
and
that
is
set
out
in
pages
4
and
5
of
our
reply
brief.
it
has
the
upstream
mortality
rates
for
the
years
1962
through
1980.
the
mortality
rate
for
spring
chinook
in
1962
was
1.33.
in
1968,
when
john
day
dam,
and
that's
the
big
killer,
when
john
day
dam
went
on
line,
it
went
to
1.56,
and
it
has
been
going
back
and
forth
between
that
figure
and
2.24
since
that
period
of
time.
but
it
is
generally--
mr.
jim
jones
--right.
mr.
jim
jones
right.
with
regard--
mr.
jim
jones
--well,
we
are
not
saying
that
we
should
force
them
to
die.
we
are
saying
that
we
have
got
a
strong
state
commitment
by
the
state
of
idaho
and
by
the
federal
government
to
ensure
that
those
runs
do
not
die
out.
the
central
idaho
wilderness
act,
the
wild
and
scenic
rivers
act
give
high
priority
to
maintaining
those
salmon
runs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
defendants
give
priority
by
their
120,000
escapement
plus
the
indian
harvest.
they
give
high
priority
to
maintaining
those
runs.
and
i
think
that
all
of
the
parties
would
like
to
see
those
runs
continue.
mr.
jim
jones
well,
if
the
five
new--
mr.
jim
jones
--what
we
do
here
today
will
not
affect
the
indians,
because
they
have
a
court
decree
to
fall
back
on.
mr.
jim
jones
that's
correct,
and
this
court
decided
that
that
was
not
necessary.
mr.
jim
jones
and
we
don't
believe
that
it
is
necessary,
because
we
have
a
court
decree
to
fall
back
on
for
the
indians
where
they
get
50
percent
of
the
fish.
mr.
jim
jones
that's
essentially
it.
we
are
saying,
let
a
few--
mr.
jim
jones
--that's
correct.
they
don't
do
too
much
fishing
above
bonneville.
we
are
just
saying,
let
a
few
of
them
come
up
to
idaho.
now,
you
know,
during
the
events
leading
up
to
this
suit,
we
did
have
an
agreement
at
one
point,
and
that
was
in
1972,
and
i
believe
the
defendants
recognize
that
we
were
entitled
to
some
fish,
and
at
that
time
there
were
some
hatchery
fish,
too,
but
anyway,
they
agreed
in
1972
that
we
could
have
an
upriver
escapement
of
spring
chinook
of
40,000.
that
would
be
above
the
uppermost
snake
dam.
and
essentially
that
would
give
us
a
spawning
escapement
goal
of
30,000
plus
about
10,000
above
the
uppermost
snake
dam.
mr.
jim
jones
thirty-thousand
over
the
uppermost
dam.
mr.
jim
jones
right,
and
anything
above
that
can
be
fished
on.
actually,
you
can
fish
below
that
level
if
you
take
the
surplus
of
the
hatcheries,
which
we
did
during
this
five-year
period,
and
it
is
a
progressive
way
to
manage
your
fish.
it
is
recognized
by
the
oregon
department
of
fisheries
and
wildlife
as
being
a
progressive
technique
that
all
of
the
parties
are
going
to
have
to
adopt.
mr.
jim
jones
that
has
been
tried,
and
it
has
been
successful
for
steelhead.
mr.
jim
jones
the
salmon?
mr.
jim
jones
no.
if
you
use
a
barge,
they
can
keep
the
scent.
mr.
jim
jones
as
far
as
we
know,
that's
what
gets
them
back
up
the
river.
they
get
the
scent
of
the
water.
mr.
jim
jones
but
if
you
use
a
barge,
that
generally
is
taken
care
of.
but
in
any
event,
i
wanted
to
just
basically
outline
what
judge
brightenstein
felt
the
situation
was
when
he
first
considered
the
case,
and
this
really
is
representative
of
the
situation.
in
1978,
in
his
report,
judge
brightenstein
said,
"the
contribution
of
idaho
to
the
total
system
fishery
is
substantial.
"
"idaho
produces
many
fish
and
receives
few.
"
"to
a
significant
extent,
idaho
is
subsidizing
the
downstream
fishery,
both
indian
and
non-indian.
"
and
that
was
supported,
those
initial
findings
were
supported
by
uncontroverted
evidence
in
the
record.
that
evidence
showed
that
from
1962
until
1980,
idaho
contributed
50
percent
to
the
upriver
runs
of
spring
chinook,
the
defendants
harvested
435,622
fish
of
idaho
origin,
constituting
83
percent.
they
left
us
17
percent
of
the
harvestable
amount.
during
that
same
period,
we
produced
40
percent
of
the
summer
chinook.
they
harvested
75
percent
of
the
idaho
origin
summer
chinook
for
a
total
of
58,069.
we
produced
or
we
contributed
48
percent
of
the
steelhead
to
the
upriver
run.
the
defendants
harvested
58
percent,
which
amounted
to
370,484
fish.
we
believe
that
the
evidence
building
on
that
shows
that
not
only
were
the
dams
depressed
because
of...
or
were
the
runs
depressed
because
of
the
dams,
and
the
mortality
caused
by
the
dams,
but
also
because
of
overfishing
by
the
defendants.
with
regard
to
spring
chinook,
they
fished
in
seven
years,
1958,
'59,
'60,
'63,
'65,
'67,
and
'74,
in
which
an
adequate
minimum
escapement
was
not
provided
for,
and
one
of
the
highest
priorities
in
fish
management
is
to
ensure
that
you
have
that
minimum
escapement
so
that
you
can
continue
the
species.
they
took
515,000
fish
and
about
half
of
those
were
of
idaho
origin.
and
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
in
1974,
just
one
year
before
the
period
that
the
master
thought
was
important,
they
fished
against
the
recommendations
of
the
biologists.
the
biologists
said,
we
aren't
going
to
have
a
fishable
run,
a
harvestable
run,
but
they
fished
anyway,
and
they
seriously
impacted
that
run.
the
escapement
over
bonneville
was
almost
half
what
it
should
have
been.
it
was
68,000
and
some
odd
fish.
and
that
had
impact.
when
you
overfish
in
one
year,
it
has
impact
in
the
future,
because
there
should
have
been
additional
fish
available
in
1968
which
would
have
been
four-year-olds
out
of
the
'74
return,
and
five-year-olds
in
the
1969
run,
yet
the
1969
run...
or
'79
run,
which
the
master
did
consider,
was
a
record
low.
so,
essentially,
if
we
say
there
is
no
relief
in
sight,
we
are
allowing
the
defendants
to
benefit
from
their
management
practices,
which
allowed
fishing
below
a
minimum
escapement.
the
same
situation
is
generally
applied
with
regard
to
the
summer
chinook
and
the
steelhead
trout.
we
believe
that
a
remedy
is
appropriate,
that
it
is
feasible,
and
that
it
is
necessary.
idaho
should
be
allocated
a
share
of
the
fish
that
it
contributes
to
these
runs.
we
are
not
asking
for
the
defendant's
fish.
we
are
asking
just
to
share
in
the
fish
that
we
contribute.
as
the
director
of
the...
or
as
the
department
of
fisheries
in
washington
indicated
in
the
publication
entitled
a
plan
for
revitalizing
the
salmon
fisheries
of
washington
state,
at
page
8...
that
is
exhibit
i-25...
"as
a
general
rule,
we
must
recognize
that
a
major
proportion
of
salmon
must
be
returned
to
all
areas
where
they
originate
for
disposition
as
their
owners
choose.
"
and
what
they
are
saying
essentially
is
that
you
have
got
to
reward
the
people
that
are
the
husbands
for
these
fish,
maintain
the
husbandry,
the
stewards
for
those
fish,
to
give
them
some
incentive
to
carry
on,
and
that
is
what
we
are
asking
for.
mr.
jim
jones
yes.
mr.
jim
jones
okay.
justice
stevens,
if
i
could,
when
i
get
up
during
my
rebuttal,
i
will
figure
that
out
and--
mr.
jim
jones
--okay.
i
would
like
to
outline--
mr.
jim
jones
--okay.
i
would
like
to
outline
just
what
i
think
are
the
minimum
elements
of
any
allocation
plan.
number
one,
we
need
to
have
minimum
escapements
over
bonneville
and
lower
granite
dams,
and
that
is
essentially
necessary.
right
now
it
is
really
essential
because
the
five-year
plan
has
expired,
and
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
minimum
escapements
that
bind
them,
so
that
we
can
have
proper
management.
there
should
be
an
allocation
for
idaho,
and
hopefully
an
allocation
based
on
contribution,
which
will
give
the
parties
incentive
to
contribute
to
those
runs.
number
three,
there
should
be
a
sharing
of
passage
losses,
because
those
dams
were
built
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendants.
they
get
the
benefits
of
the
power.
they
ought
to
share
the
burden
of
the
passage
losses.
and
number
four,
there
ought
to
be
a
catchup
clause
just
like
the
indians
have
that
say,
if
you
don't
make
the
proper
allocation
this
years,
the
upstream
states
get
it
the
next
year,
and
it
works
both
ways.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
these
fish
are
a
treasure,
not
only
for
idaho
but
for
the
nation,
and
they
can
and
must
be
protected
and
restored,
and
i
think
that
in
order
to
do
that,
you
have
to
give
the
stewards
a
share
of
the
bounty.
thank
you.
mr.
jim
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jim
jones
yes.
now,
we
have
done
a
calculation,
and
i
believe
this
is
in
the
supplemental
brief
that
was
filed
with
the
court,
with
the
master,
taking
the
1977
year
as
an
example--
mr.
jim
jones
--with
the
master.
mr.
jim
jones
it
should
be
in
the
record.
mr.
jim
jones
it
should
be
in
the
record.
now,
taking
a
total
upriver
run
size
for
spring
chinook
of
175,000,
in
that
year,
the
washington
and
oregon
origin
fish
were
53
percent.
idaho
origin
fish
constituted
47
percent,
which
amounted
to
82,000
fish.
those
were
headed
up
the
river
to
the
snake
river
to
idaho.
and
that
is
figured
using
existing
methodology
that
the
defendants
are
well
acquainted
with.
using
the
seven-year...
or
the
five-year
plan
that
was
in
existence
at
that
time,
of
idaho
origin
fish,
the
treaty
fishery
would
have
received
10,400.
oregon
and
washington,
considering
the
contribution
of
53
percent,
would
have
received
of
the
harvestable
surplus
8,300.
we
would
have
had
an
escapement
over
lower
granite
dam,
the
uppermost
dam
on
the
snake
river,
of
37,200.
that
would
have
left
a
spawning
escapement
of
30,000
fish,
and
idaho
would
have
had
a
harvest
based
on
their
47
percent
contribution
to
the
idaho...
to
the
entire
run,
they
would
have
had
a
harvest
of
7,200
fish.
so,
what
we
are
doing
is
taking
the
fish
that
idaho
contributes
to
that
run,
using
existing
methodology
that
the
defendants
use
and
that
they
rely
on
in
determining
that
we
should
receive
47
percent
of
the
idaho
origin
harvestable
surplus,
the
non-treaty
surplus,
and
that
the
defendant
should
receive
53
percent
of
it.
they
would
take
theirs
down
the
river.
we
would
take
ours
up
the
river.
mr.
jim
jones
that
would
include
the
approximately
30
to
50
percent
of
the
run
that
is
comprised
of
hatchery
fish.
i
previously
mentioned
a
case
that...
i
think
i
miscited
it...
the
case
in
which
the
court
indicated
that
hatchery
fish
should
be
considered
the
same
as
natural
fish
because
they
are
only
mitigating
for
damages
caused
by
the
dams
was
a
court
of
appeals
case,
united
states
against
washington,
694
federal
2nd
1374,
a
ninth
circuit
case,
where
washington
was
making
the
contention
that
the
indians
shouldn't
have
any
part
of
the
hatchery
fish,
and
the
court
stated,
the
fact
is
that
the
state
hatchery
program
was
established
to
mitigate
for
fish
artificially
lost
by
the...
to
replace
fish
artificially
lost
by
dams,
and
that
they
should--
mr.
jim
jones
--well,
they
do
come
from
hatcheries
in
idaho.
mr.
jim
jones
well,
it
gives
us
a
little
bit
of
a
claim,
along
with
the
defendants,
too.
mr.
jim
jones
a
little...
a
claim
to
share
them.
mr.
jim
jones
we
are
only
asking--
mr.
jim
jones
--well,
because
idaho
has
had
to
make
a
lot
of
sacrifices
to
make
sure
that
those
fish
continue,
we
are
not
able
to
have
any
dams
on
our
wild
and
scenic
rivers
so
that
those
fish
can
continue.
we
are
not
able
to
do
any
dredge
or
placer
mining.
so
we
have
made
a
lot
of
sacrifices.
we
are
not
able
to
use
the
waters
of
those
rivers
for
harvests.
mr.
jim
jones
a
majority
of
idahoans
apparently
supported--
mr.
jim
jones
--no.
and
the
federal
government
did,
too.
a
majority
of
idaho
people
supported--
mr.
jim
jones
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jim
jones
the
people
of
idaho
supported
the
central
wilderness
area
act
that
said
that
we
couldn't
have
any
dams
on
those
rivers.
the
wild
and
scenic
rivers
act,
which
congress
passed
here,
which
said
we
couldn't
have
any
dams
on
those
rivers,
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
is
to
make
sure
that
these
runs
of
fish
continue.
so
we've
had
our
sacrifices,
and
we
ought
to
be
able
to
share
in
the
bounty.
that
is
all
we
are
asking
for.
mr.
jim
jones
seventy-seven,
your
honor.
mr.
jim
jones
the
figures
around
it,
i
think
that
we
have
set
those
out
in
that
supplemental
brief.
there
were
some
corrections
that
were
made,
but
i
believe
that
they
were
correct
numbers,
and
that
they
were
just
rounded.
mr.
jim
jones
for
'77.
