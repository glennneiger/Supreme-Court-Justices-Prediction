h.
rehnquist
well,
general
jones,
you
are
not
suggesting
the
master
isn't
entitled
to
disbelieve
testimony
even
though
it
is
unrebutted,
are
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
mackie,
does
your
answer
suggest
that
you
think
every
time
a
person...
a
state
is
entitled
to
equitable
apportionment
in
the
abstract,
they
are
also
entitled
to
a
decree?
couldn't
the
master...
i
mean,
i
read
the
master's
finding
in
this
case
as
being
pretty
much
saying
in
the
abstract
they
may
have
some
right,
but
there
just
isn't
any
way
we
could
give
them
relief
on
these
facts.

rehnquist
the
principle
of
ahkan's
razor.
if
there
is
no
remedy,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
whether
there
is
a
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
do
tributaries
go
into
oregon
or
come
from
oregon?
