general
jones,
can
i
ask
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
have
to
answer
it
right
now,
but
before
you
get
through,
it
would
be
very
helpful
to
me
if
you
picked
any
year
you
like
and
tell
me
for
a
particular
run
how
many
fish
you
think
the
indians,
your
adversaries,
and
you
could
take
out
of
that
run
under
your
proposal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
can't...
it
is
very,
very
difficult
to
understand
your
theory.
at
least
it
is
for
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
still
puzzled--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
your
legal
position.
i
hate
to...
supposing
you
had
a
case
where
there
were
no
dams
at
all,
and
your
state
took
off
all
the
fish,
fished
them
all.
would
idaho
have
any
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
would
have
a
legal...
they
would
have
an
equitable
right
under
those
facts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
disagree
with
that
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
fish
that
originate
in
washington
and
oregon
are
also
very
small
when
they
originate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the
percentages
aren't
affected
by
the
size
at
the
time
of
birth,
are
they?
percentage
in
the
run
at
any
given
time
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
it
is
really
more
than
an
originating
state,
because
it
is
also
the
state
to
which
the
fish
would
normally
return
if
there
were
no
dams
and
no
fishing.
justice
stevens
ninety-eight
percent
of
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
mackie,
can
i
interrupt
with
a
question
about
the
figures?
they
vary
dramatically
from
year
to
year
in
all
sorts
of
ways,
and
i
notice
one
of
the
most
complete
schedules
in
the
papers
is
the
one
at
pages
4,
5,
and
6
of
your
adversary's
reply
brief.
they
are
not...
of
course,
all
those
are
not
findings
by
the
master.
to
what
extent
do
you
think
it
is
proper
for
us
to
rely
on
those
figures?
do
you
challenge
them
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes,
but
for
example,
do
you
accept
the
basic
idaho
percentages
that
they
set
forth
in
those
tables?
you
had
the
98
percent
as
one
example.
that
was
kind
of
an
unusual
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
other
percentages
are
consistent
with
your
understanding
of
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question
about
the
figures
you
gave
us?
were
those
for
the...
am
i
correct,
they
were
for
spring
chinook
for
the
1976
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
jibe
with
the
record
if
they
are
'77.
well,
that's
all
right.
justice
stevens
for
'77,
though?
