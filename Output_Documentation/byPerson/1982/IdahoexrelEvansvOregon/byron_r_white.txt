aren't
you
including
in
idaho's
contribution
the
hatchery
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
assign
those
hatcheries
to
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
assign
those
hatcheries
to
idaho
as
a
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
put
all
the
hatcheries
there,
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
asked
you,
did
you
put
all
the
hatcheries
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
did?
who--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many...
what...
how
many
hatcheries
did
idaho
itself
put
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
hatcheries
are
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say...
and
idaho
financed
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
again,
the
formula
that
you
want
would
provide
for
how
many
fish
coming
over
bonneville?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
120,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
out
of
the
120,000,
how
much
of
that
would
be
necessary
to
keep
their
runs
going?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
but
what
i
really
want
to
know,
then,
is
how
would
you
ever
harvest
any
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
plus
your
share.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
the
120,000
is
the
minimum
to
keep
the
runs
alive?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
many...
do
you
have...
can
you
quantify
like
that,
the
indians
would
get
how
many
fish?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
count
the
fish
going
over
bonneville--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
then
you
take
off
120,
and
whatever
is
left
over,
the
indians
get
half
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
above
bonneville?
justice
white
when
was
the
last
dam
put
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
one
closest
to
idaho,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
going
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
going
to
happen
now
that
the
five-year
plan
has
terminated?
is
there
some
prospect
for
another
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
indians
are
not
parties
to
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
is
not
a
party,
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
want
the
defendant
states
not
to
fish
so
much
below
bonneville.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
let
more
fish
get
through
bonneville
and
also
keep
their
catch
down
above
bonneville.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
fish
do
have
to
reach
idaho
waters
to
satisfying
the
spawning
requirement,
30,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
to
get
to
idaho?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
they
tried
the
transporting
of
fish
downstream
around
the
dams?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
salmon?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
they
do,
lose
their
way
on
the
way
back?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
i
read
your
brief,
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
fish
just
weren't
a
subject
for
equitable
apportionment,
and
that
the
master
was
just
wrong
in
saying
that
idaho
was...
did
have
an
equitable
right,
and
if
it
could
prove
it
up,
it
would
get
relief.
i
thought
you
were
just
against
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
our
prior
opinion
precluded
the
master...
would
have
precluded
the
master
from,
after
hearing
the
evidence,
saying
there
is
not
a
right
to
equitable
apportionment?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
is
justiciable.
it
is
like
filing
a
complaint.
it
is
certainly
justiciable,
but
it
is
justiciable,
you
might...
you
might
judge
it
by
saying
you
fail
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
disagree
with
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
is
just
addressing
the
fish
that
get
above
the
dam.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
how
many
fish
get
above
the
dam.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
in
order
to
let
more
fish
up,
but
they
are
not
saying
you
aren't
entitled
to
take
any
idaho
fish
below
the
dam.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
some
idaho
fish
get
above
the
dam,
they
get
98
percent
of
98
percent.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
fish
that
get
above
the
dam.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
anywhere,
below
the
dam
or
above
the
dam?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
sohappy
being
reopened?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
still
has
jurisdiction,
and
it
is
going
to
manage
it
on
that
basis,
but
i
suppose
it
will
be...
there
will
be
further
litigation
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
case
there
would
be
a
decree,
and
it
would
set
a
minimum
escapement.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
agreement
did,
though,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
idaho
a
party
to
the
sohappy?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
washington
and
oregon
are?
or
just
their
fishing
authorities?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
there
was
an
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
idaho
ever
tried
to
intervene
in
that
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
a
lot
of
the
hatcheries
above
hell's
canyon?
justice
byron
r.
white
hell's
canyon
blocks
either
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
either
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
way
to
cure
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
really
the...
the
fishery,
the
spawning
grounds
then
is
really
for
the
rivers
originating
in
idaho
below
hell's
canyon.
justice
byron
r.
white
supplemental
brief
filed
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
here?
