mr.
frey,
do
we
focus
in
this
case
on
the
use
of
the
beeper
to
locate
the
cabin,
or
the
use
of
the
beeper
to
locate
the
barrel
on
the
premises?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact,
it
was
found
outside
the
house,
was
it
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
can?
do
you
agree,
mr.
frey,
that
if
the
beeper
had
been
used
to
monitor
at
the
location
of
the
barrel
on
the
premises,
to
tell
you
where
it
physically
was
located,
for
example,
within
the
house,
that
that
would
constitute
a
search?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
agree
that
it
is
or
is
not,
rather
than
just
a
tougher
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
locate
it
in
the
bedroom
of
the
house.

mr.

justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
peterson,
i
suppose
the
state
of
origin
could
require
a
purchaser
of
precursor
chemicals
to
give
their
name
and
the
destination
of
the
chemicals
as
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme,
could
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how
is
use
of
the
beeper
to
determine
where
the
chemicals
went
different
from
the
state
requiring
that
disclosure
in
the
first
instance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
might
lie
about
it,
i
suppose,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
basic
interests
at
stake
here,
and
what
greater
interest
in
the
ultimate
destination
of
the
chemicals
does
the
owner
of
the
property
have
than
he
would
have
if
the
state
asked
in
the
first
instance
when
they
were
purchased
where
it
was
going.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure,
and
the
government
did
that,
based
on
this
information.
let
me
ask
you
another
question,
mr.
peterson.
i
guess
you
agree
that
if
the
narcotics
agents
had
been
better
drivers,
they
would
have
been
able
to
follow
the
vehicle
in
the
first
place,
and
discover
that
it
had
arrived
at
the
cabin
with
the
barrel
of
chemicals.
