justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
let
us
be
the
judge
of
what
this
case
involves
knowing
about?
i
for
one
would
like
to
know
a
little
bit
more
about
the
beeper
than
you've
told
us
so
far,
about
how
it
does
monitor
and
that
sort
of
thing.
i
think
this
kind
of
broad,
general
statements
about,
it
was
in
the
house,
it
wasn't
in
the
house,
we
don't
know
where
it
was,
light
might
be
shed
upon
it
if
we
had
some
idea
of
the...
what
happens,
how
far
away
is
the
thing
that
is
monitoring
the
thing,
how
does
it
monitor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
you
are
away
from
it,
your
task
is
simply
to
hone
in
on
it,
i
suppose,
or
to
keep
track
of
it.

william

or
sonar.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
record
show,
mr.
peterson,
about
the
nature
of
his
use
of
that
building?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
it
show
that?
or
could
you
just
tell
me
generally?
i
can
find
it
myself.
are
there
findings
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
go
to
the
curtilage,
you
are
confronted
with
the
open
fields
doctrine
of
the
hester
case,
aren't
you?
if
you
say
it
didn't
make
any
difference
if
it
was
100
yards
away
from
any
structure,
so
long
as
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
his
real
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
was
quoted
with
approval
in
at
least
two
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
since
coolidge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
still
think
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
cited
by
whom?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
take
their
view
in
preference
to
ours?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire
has
survived,
might
be
a
more
appropriate
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
that
involves
beepers.
a
beeper
is
a
radio
transmitter
which
emits
periodic
signals
that
can
be
picked
up
by
a
radio
receiver.
in
this
case,
minnesota
police
officers
arranged
with
a
seller
of
chemicals
to
install
a
beeper
inside
a
five-gallon
container
of
chloroform.
chloroform
can
be
used
in
manufacturing
illegal
drugs.
after
the
container
was
sold,
the
police
followed
its
movements.
it
changed
hands
once
but
by
maintaining
contact
through
visual
surveillance
and
monitoring
the
beeper
signal,
the
police
were
able
to
track
the
chloroform
container
across
the
st.
croix
river
and
then
to
wisconsin
to
respondent's
secluded
cabin
near
shell
lake,
wisconsin.
a
subsequent
search
of
the
cabin
pursuant
to
a
warrant
revealed
an
illegal
drug
traffic.
we've
been
asked
to
decide
whether
the
monitoring
of
the
beeper
violated
any
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
held
by
respondent
thus
running
afoul
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
have
concluded
that
it
did
not.
the
surveillance
in
this
case
was
directed
to
the
following
of
an
automobile
on
public
streets
and
highways
and
to
its
departure
from
the
highway
onto
respondent's
privately
owned
premises.
a
person
travelling
on
public
thoroughfares
could
not
reasonably
expect
that
his
movements
on
those
thoroughfares
and
his
departure
from
them
will
not
be
observed
by
others.
everything
learned
by
the
police
officers
in
this
case
could
have
been
learned
by
visual
surveillance
from
public
places.
the
fact
that
the
officers
augmented
their
sensory
facilities
with
such
enhancement
as
science
and
technology
afford
does
not
require
any
different
constitutional
analysis.
because
of
our
view
that
monitoring
the
beeper
signals
did
not
invade
any
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
on
respondent's
part,
we
have
concluded
that
there
was
neither
a
search
nor
a
seizure
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which
justice
marshall
has
joined.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
which

brennan,

stevens
