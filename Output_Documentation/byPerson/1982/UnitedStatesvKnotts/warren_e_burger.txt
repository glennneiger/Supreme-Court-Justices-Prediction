mr.
frey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
any
different
fundamentally
from
the
directional
signals
given
to
airplanes
to
guide
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
whether
there
is
a
search
when
the
beeper
is
affixed
to
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--without
giving
notice
to
the
other
party.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
range
of
this
signal?
does
the
record
show
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
open
field
questions
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--do
you
see
any
analogy
between
this
and
having
an
airplane,
a
helicopter
just
follow
them
by
visual
contact?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
searches?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
make
it
an
automobile
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
installation
of
this
electronic
device
be
in
principle
different
from
planting
an
undercover
agent
in
the
laboratory
who
would
then
send
out
signals
to
locate
the
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
try
it
on
sam
irvin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
peterson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
you
say,
mr.
peterson,
if
in
a
kidnapping
case,
for
example,
all
of
the
bills
were
impregnated
with
some
chemical
which
would
get
onto
the
fingers
and
hands
of
anyone
who
touched
it
and
could
not
be
removed
for
quite
a
long
time,
but
was
something
that
could
not
be
observed?
and
that
led
ultimately
to
the
unfolding
that
we
have
here?
would
you
say
that
was
an
invasion
of
privacy,
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
have
a
negative...
would
it
have
the
consequences
you
are
arguing
for
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
right.
now
let's
change
it
to
money
bags,
a
whole
lot
of
money
bags
that
are
in
a
brinks
truck
or
in
a
bank.
and
the
bags
are
equipped
in
some
way
with
an
electronic
device
such
as
was
used
here,
and
then
the
property
was
stolen
either
from
the
bank
or
from
the
brinks
truck,
and
it
is
followed,
just
as
it
was
here.
what
would
be
your
analysis
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
the
warrant...
let's
assume
that
just
as
here,
after
this
signal
came
to
rest
in
one
place,
in
the
same
manner
as
it
was
monitored
here,
then
the
police
or
the
agents
move
in
with
a
warrant
which
they
have
got
on
the
basis
of
the
electronic
signal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
it
contraband?
money
is
innocent
in
and
of
itself,
and
very
good
in
the
minds
of
most
of
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--for
the
purposes
that
he
purchased
it
and
ultimately
was
using
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
challenging
that
that
is
part
of
this
whole
package?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
why
is
it
different
from
the
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
it
is
found
in
the
laboratory
where
they
are
making
prohibited
drugs,
is
it
not
as
much
contraband
as
the
money,
assuming
the
money
is
contraband,
which
i
am
not
sure
of?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
you
have
persuaded
me
of
by
that
response
is
that
the
money
and
the
chloroform
are
identically
the
same
under
the
fourth
amendment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
said
that
when
it
is
in
the
laboratory
for
use
in
making
illegal
drugs,
that
it
is
contraband,
part
of
an
illegal
operation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--but
you
have
just
previously
said
you
do
not
challenge
that
it
was
to
be
used
for
that
illegal
purpose.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
a
person
could
have
three
or
four
homes,
could
he
not?
if
he
is
living
in
the
place,
then
does
it
not
fall
under
the
fourth
amendment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
might
have
four
of
those
places.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
would
the
warrant
be
required?
at
the
time
they
put
it
on
the
drum
of
chloroform
in
the
warehouse
of
the
pharmaceutical
company?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
at
the
time
of
the
transfer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
illegal
activity
that
is
going
on,
and
to
which
this
warrant
would
be
aimed,
when
the
chloroform
drum
is
sitting
in
the
warehouse
of
the
drug
company?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
what
basis
would
a
magistrate
issue
a
warrant
for
a
lawful,
innocent
drum
of
chloroform
in
a
warehouse?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
say
that
they
should
get
the
warrant
to
put
the
electronic
device
on
the
drum,
or
get
a
warrant
to
monitor,
to
listen
to
the
signal?
which
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
is
a
beeper
that
is
sought
to
be
put
on
a
plane
by
undercover
agents
down
in
bogota,
colombia,
because
they
know
that
a
couple
of
million
dollars
worth
of
heroin
or
something
is
going
to
be
transported
on
an
airplane?
any
authority
on
a
u.s.
magistrate
or
any
magistrate
in
the
united
states
to
put
a
beeper
on
an
airplane
down
in
bogota,
colombia?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
fundamentally
different
from
the
problems
we
have
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
agents
were
putting
it
on
the
airplane
down
at
some
air
base
there,
air
force
port
in
bogota,
or
on
the
outskirts,
they
would
be
doing
it
for
the
purpose
of
following
that
airplane
to
see
if
it
landed
in
the
united
states
with
its
contraband
drugs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
it
lands
in
an
airport,
a
concealed
airport
out
in
the
everglades
of
florida,
and
they
run
it
into
a
hangar,
to
conceal
it
from
the
air,
and
the
hangar
is
where
four
or
five
people
live,
and
unload
the
illegal
drugs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
parallel
to
this
case,
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
parallel
to
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
rehnquist
will
announce
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
united
states
against
knotts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
rehnquist.
