mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
issues
in
this
case
began
when
a
drug
task
force
in
minnesota
was
investigating
the
activities
of
one
of
respondent's
co-conspirators,
one
armstrong,
who
they
had
reason
to
believe
was
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
illegal
drugs.
they
acquired
information
that
armstrong
was
making
purchases
of
certain
precursor
chemicals
used
in
the
manufacture
of
amphetamine
from
a
particular
drug
company,
and
with
the
cooperation...
or
chemical
company...
and
with
the
cooperation
of
that
company,
they
placed
a
beeper
or
radio
transmitter
in
a
false
bottom
in
a
five-gallon
container
of
chloroform
which
armstrong
was
scheduled
to
pick
up.
armstrong
came
to
the
chemical
company,
picked
up
the
chloroform,
loaded
it
in
his
car,
and
was
then
followed
by
physical
visual
surveillance
to
the
home
of
co-defendant
petschen,
where
the
container
was
seen
to
be
transferred
into
petschen's
vehicle.
petschen
then
left
and
was
followed
both
visually
and
with
the
use
of
the
beeper
as
he
drove
from
minnesota
to
wisconsin.
at
one
point
during
his
travels
on
the
road,
the
officers
lost
both
visual
and
beeper
contact,
but
they
regained
it
while
he
was
still
in
the
course
of
his
trip,
and
then
they
lost
it
for
a
second
time.
at
that
point,
with
the
aid
of
an
aircraft,
and
after
the
passage
of
perhaps
a
half
an
hour
to
an
hour,
the
beeper
was
located
emitting
signals
from
the
property
of
respondent
knotts.
there
followed
a
visual
surveillance
over
the
course
of
a
couple
of
days,
and
then
a
warrant,
search
warrant
was
obtained
to
search
the
property
and
the
search
disclosed
a
clandestine
laboratory
to
manufacture
these
chemicals,
and
of
course
the
chloroform
container
which
contained
the
beeper
and
various
other
precursor
chemicals.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
warrant
is
required
to
monitor
the
signals
emitted
by
a
beeper
from
a
container
that
has
arrived
at
an
individual's
property.
the
answer
to
this
question
involves
potentially
two
different
kinds
of
inquiries.
first,
whether
the
use
of
this
investigative
technique
is
a
search
or
seizure
at
all,
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
that
would,
i
think,
end
this
case.
secondly,
if
it
is
a
search
or
seizure,
what
quantum
of
suspicion
must
exist
to
support
the
use
of
this
technique,
and
must
such
use
be
accompanied
by
a
warrant.
now,
before
turning
to
these
issues,
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court
briefly
something
about
how
beepers
or
beacons,
as
they
are
called,
operate,
and
how
they
are
used.
it
is
basically
an
fm
transmitter
that
emits
a
radio
signal
which,
when
monitored,
discloses
the
location
of
the
beeper.
there
are
some
beepers,
not
the
one
in
this
case,
that
will
also
disclose
when
the
package
is
being
moved
or
opened.
a
beeper
is
a
fairly
expensive
device.
i
am
told
it
costs
somewhere
between
$700
and
$1,200.
the
kind
of
beeper
used
in
this
case
is
fairly
small.
it
weighs
about
a
half
a
pound,
and
is
about
three
inches
long.
there
are
essentially
two
ways
in
which
these
devices
are
used.
one
is
attached
to
a
vehicle
or
vessel,
car,
plane,
or
boat,
for
purposes
of
following
the
movements
of
that,
and
the
second
is
placed
in
some
way
inside
a
container
or
other
object.
now,
in
either
case,
the
basic
purpose
of
this
device
is
to
be
employed
as
an
aid
to
surveillance
to
track
movement.
now,
the
container
beeper
is
sometimes
employed
for
an
additional
purpose,
in
addition
to
tracking
the
movement,
which
is
to
determine
whether
the
object,
the
container
remains
located
at
a
particular
place
or,
as
i
mentioned,
in
some
instances,
whether
it
has
been
opened.
now,
car
beepers
are
useful
in
a
wide
variety
of
cases,
kidnapping
cases,
espionage
cases,
extortion
cases,
any
kind
of
case
where
visual
surveillance
might
be
important.
the
container
beeper--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
it
is
a
radio
signal,
and
it
could
be
picked
up
by
others.
it
is
just
a
beep,
beep,
beep.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
you
would
need
an
appropriate
receiver.
i
am
not
sure
of
the
technology,
but
i
think
a
receiver
tuned
to
the
right
frequency
will,
if
it
was
close
enough--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
think
it
is.
it
is
much
less
powerful.
the
range
of
these
things--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
was...
it
was
discovered
when
the
search
took
place
outside
the
cabin
in
a
barrel,
under
a
barrel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
they
had
the
right
equipment
and
tuned
it
to
the
right
frequency.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
but
i
think
the
equipment--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
am
not
sure
what
frequency
it--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
but
there
are
scanners
that
will
scan
a
wavelength
and
pick
up--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
suppose,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean,
in
the
way
of
counter-surveillance.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
could
be.
there
are
some
kinds
of
beepers
called
transponders
which
do
not
emit
a
continuous
signal,
and
only
emit
a
signal
when
you
activate
them,
and
they
are
less
subject
to
being
discovered
by
these
means.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
any
event,
fortunately,
this
mode
of
counter-surveillance
is
not
extensive
at
this
point.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
may
be,
although
for
a
number
of
years
these
devices
have
been
being
used,
and
with
considerable
success.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
the
cabin
itself.
what
was
held
to
be
improper
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
monitoring
of
the
beeper
while
it
was
on
the
property.
the
only
piece
of
information
that
was
used,
that
was
garnered
from
the
beeper
that
was
relevant
to
the
search
warrant
application,
and
this
is
a
fruits
case...
nobody
questions
that
the
warrant
itself
was
supported
by
probable
cause...
was
the
knowledge
that
the
container
of
chloroform
was
on
respondent
knotts's
property.
now,
the
beepers
are,
as
i
say,
expensive.
their
use
is
hardly
an
everyday
occurrence.
its
use
is
usually
accompanied
by
airplane
surveillance,
car
surveillance
by
a
number
of
agents.
but
although
it
is
not
frequent,
it
is
hard
to
estimate
its
utilities.
it
is
absolutely
essential
in
investigations
like
this
that
the
existence
of
surveillance
not
be
discovered
by
the
suspects.
and
in
this
case,
as
in
many
others,
suspects
do
use
counter-surveillance
techniques,
erratic
driving,
sudden
u-turns,
and
various
other
things
to
try
to
detect
the
presence
of
and
to
throw
off
visual
surveillance.
with
the
use
of
the
beeper,
you
do
not
need
to
maintain
eye
contact
with
the
vehicle
that
you
are
following
and
are
able
to
mount
a
more
effective
surveillance
of
the
public
movements
of
the
car
on
the
highway.
also
in
the
drug
manufacturing
cases
such
as
this,
it
is
common
practice
for
the
suspects
to
acquire
chemicals
gradually,
store
them
at
various
locations,
move
them
from
place
to
place.
sometimes
the
chemicals
will
be
acquired
1,000
miles
from
where
the
laboratory
is
to
which
they
are
ultimately
transported,
and
the
maintenance
over
a
period
of
time
of
physical
surveillance
would
be
incredibly
costly
and
very
difficult
to
do
without
being
detected.
now,
turning
to
the
specific
legal
issues
in
this
case,
there
are
two
somewhat
different
types
of
issues
raised,
as
i
mentioned,
one,
whether
there
is
a
search,
and
second,
what
procedures
and
quantum
of
suspicion
would
be
necessary
if
it
was.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
of
that,
and
indeed
at
the
time
it
would
belong
to
the
chemical
company.
the
question
is
whether
the
monitoring
of
the
airwaves
by
the
receiver
which
picks
up
the
signal
which
is
being
emitted
by
the
beeper
is
a
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
obviously,
notice
would
render
the
whole
investigation
impossible.
this
is
not
a
search
in
the
traditional
sense.
it
is
not
the
uninvited
eye
or
uninvited
ear
that
is
seeing
or
hearing
what
is
going
on
in
private
areas.
in
fact,
all
that
is
examined
in
this
search
is
the
airwaves
around
the
receiver
being
operated
by
the
officers.
now,
of
course,
katz
teaches
that
even
such
activity
may
be
considered
a
search
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment,
but
whether
it
is
depends
on
whether
what
is
disclosed
by
this
kind
of
activity
is
private
or
non-private
information.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
told
that
it
is
normally,
in
open
country,
about
two
to
four
miles
on
the
road,
and
in
the
city
it
may
be
only
several
blocks.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
i
don't
believe
the
court
has
to
deal
with
any
in
this
case.
aircraft
are
used
because
from
the
air
the
signal
can
be
picked
up
at
a
longer
distance,
and
the
range,
i
am
told,
is
20
to
50
miles,
and
that
is
why
you
often
lose
track
in
the
automobile
surveillance,
because
you
are
not
keeping
eye
contact,
and
if
the
suspect
gets
two
or
three
miles
away
from
you,
you
may
lose
the
signal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
whether
there
are
obstacles
in
the
way,
yes.
now,
this
question
of
whether
this
use
of
the
beeper
in
this
case
was
a
search
is
quite
similar
to
the
issue
the
court
confronted
in
smith
against
maryland,
which
involved
the
monitoring
by
use
of
a
pen
register
of
phone
numbers
dialed
from
the
suspect's
home.
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
a
search,
in
large
part
because
the
information
acquired
was
not
private
information.
now,
so
here,
the
monitoring
of
the
transmitter
to
follow
the
co-defendant's
car
while
it
moved
on
the
public
highways
would
not
be
a
search,
and
indeed
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
respondent
has
suggested
otherwise.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
similar.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
of
course,
if
you
followed
them
closely,
they
would
know
that
they
were
being
followed,
and
it
would
affect
the
effectiveness,
but
it
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
is
similar
to,
let's
say,
painting
a
stripe,
a
fluorescent
stripe
on
the
top
of
the
car
to
facilitate
visual
surveillance.
what
is
being
learned
from
an
automobile
beeper
or
from
the
use
of
the
container
beeper
in
this
case
was
the
movements
of
a
vehicle
on
the
public
highway,
including
the
turning
onto
any
private
property.
those
things
are
not
private
events.
nobody
has
a
right
to
keep
people
from
knowing
those
things,
and
under
the
analysis
in
smith,
those
things
are
not
a
search.
now,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
even
suggests,
and
i
am
not
sure
that
respondent
contests
that
if
they
had
managed
in
this
case
to
maintain
continuous
surveillance,
beeper
surveillance
of
the
vehicle
as
it
went
across
the
roads
and
ultimately
onto
knotts's
property,
there
would
have
been
no
fourth
amendment
problem.
the
problem
arose
because
they
lost
track
of
the
vehicle
and
of
the
beeper,
and
by
the
time
they
turned
it
on,
it
was
situated
on
knotts's
property,
and
the
court
in
effect
takes
a
strict
liability
position,
that
the
government
has
no
way
of
knowing,
of
course,
where
the
container
is,
because
only
by
using
the
beeper
do
you
find
that,
but
the
government
is
out
of
luck
if
when
they
use
the
beeper
the
container
is
then
located
on
private
property.
now,
the
situation
that
respondent
wishes
to
analogize
this
case
to
is
the
situation
in
which
a
beeper
is
used
to
monitor,
let's
say,
the
continued
presence
over
an
extended
period
of
time
of
a
container
inside
somebody's
house,
or
to
monitor
such
activity
inside
somebody's
house
as
the
opening
of
a
container.
those
things
are
different,
because
those
are
not
public
events,
and
arguably
those
things
would
properly
be
classified
as
a
search
under
the
katz
test.
but
in
this
case,
the
only
fact
that
was
used,
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
tainted
in
getting
the
warrant
was
the
fact
that
petschen's
car
had
driven
with
the
container
onto
knotts's
property.
now,
i
will
assume
from
now
on
that
something
that
happened
here
is
held
to
be
a
search,
and
i
want
to
discuss
the
questions
that
arise
in
that
event,
and
there
are
basically
two.
the
first
question--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
would
be
in
these
chemical
company
cases
no
standing,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
to
complain
about
the
installation,
and
in
the
automobile
cases
where
there
is
a
nominal--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
insertion
of
the
beeper
required
an
opening
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
think
it
would
be
the
same
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
would--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
would
be
the
same
as
the
automobile
case,
and
in
both
cases
i
would
say
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
but
whether
it...
the
importance
of
it
being
in
somebody's
home
has
to
do
with
the
monitoring
of
activities
inside
the
home.
the
fact
that
it
goes
into
the
home
is
of
no
consequence
except
insofar
as
you
learn
something
that
is
going
on
inside
the
home
by
virtue
of
use
of
the
beeper.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
know
whether
it
went
into
the
cabin.
what
we
know
is
only
what
we
could
have
learned
if
we
had
been
able
to
maintain
visual
surveillance,
which
is
that
they
were
carried
to
this
cabin.
we
don't
know
whether
they
were
in
the
cabin
or
outside
the
cabin,
and
we
did
not
in
this
case
use,
as
has
been
done
in
some
other
cases,
use
the
beeper
to
monitor
continued
presence
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was
persuasive
to
establish
that
there
was
a
clandestine...
probably
a
clandestine
laboratory
present
at
the
cabin.
in
fact,
we
expected
and
found--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--much
more
than
just
the
can
of
chloroform.
we
found
thousands
of
dollars
of
equipment,
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
have
a
couple
of
difficulties
that
i
think
should
be
pointed
out
about
the
warrants
in
this
case.
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
later,
but
i
will
get
to
it
now.
one
of
the
problems
is
that
you
cannot
comply
with
the
particularity
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment,
because
you
cannot
particularly
describe
the
place
to
be
searched.
now,
a
second
problem
under
rule
41
is
that
it
will
often
be
the
case
that
the
magistrate
or
judge
to
whom
you
go
will
not
have
authority
to
authorize
a
search
wherever
the
container
may
end
up.
in
this
case,
the
only
time
we
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
was
in
minnesota.
we
would
have
gone
to
a
magistrate
in
minneapolis.
he
has
no
authority
to
issue
a
warrant
to
search
a
house
in
wisconsin.
we
didn't
know
whether
this
was
going
to
wisconsin
or
where.
now,
the
court
could
craft,
or
congress,
if
it
wished,
i
think,
would
clearly
have
the
power
to
craft
some
procedures
to
regulate
the
use
of
beepers,
but
it
is
certainly
not
easy
without
bending
the
fourth
amendment's
warrant
clause
somewhat
to
have
a
beeper
warrant
in
this
kind
of
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
beeper
provides
us
with
a
fact
that
is
useful--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--in
obtaining
a
search
warrant.
this
is
another
point
about
the
warrant
that
i
think
is
important,
is
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases,
when
a
real
search
takes
place,
there
will
be
a
warrant
procured,
and
all
the
information
that
would
have
been
presented
to
the
magistrate
to
get
the
beeper
warrant
will
be
reviewed,
and
if
that
information
did
not
make
out
probable
cause,
unless
more
information
has
been
acquired
that
does
contribute
to
probable
cause,
a
warrant
won't
be
obtained.
in
any
event,
this
whole
procedure
will
not
ordinarily
be
free
of
some
kind
of
meaningful
judicial
review
before
there
is
a
really
intrusive
search
into
private
property.
now--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
have
placed
the
beeper
in
and
the
property
becomes
at
some
point
the
respondent's
private
property,
although
not
until
it
went
through
several
hands
and
landed
at
his
property.
but
i
understand
the
gravamen
of
respondent's
argument
in
this
case
to
be
that
it
was
the
search
of
his
home
from
monitoring
the
beeper
signal
that
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
and
so
i
have
been
addressing
my
argument
principally
to
that
contention,
and
that,
i
think,
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
found.
and
i
do
believe
that
that
is
the
only
viable
contention
that
could
be
made
in
this
area.
now,
if
this
is
a
search,
there
are
two
questions.
is
probable
cause
necessary
to
support
the
search,
or
can
it
be
done
on
reasonable
suspicion,
or
something
less?
and
if
probable
cause
is
required,
is
a
warrant
required?
now,
of
these
two
questions,
by
far
the
most
important
as
a
practical
matter
is
the
question
of
whether
it
can
be
conducted
on
reasonable
suspicion.
and
in
fact,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
court
holds
there
is
a
search,
it
will
cause
no
problems
if
it
allows
it
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion,
because
this
simply
is
not
a
device
that
is
used
on
a
random
basis
without
a
substantial
basis
for
expecting
that
it
will
produce
evidence
useful
in
a
criminal
investigation.
so,
as
a
practical
matter,
although
there
are
theoretical
problems
with
holding
this
a
search,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
important
question
for
us
is
whether
these
devices
can
be
used
on
the
basis
of
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
sir.
i
don't
understand
there
to
be
a
contention
in
these
cases...
in
this
case
that
the
installation
of
the
beeper
is
a
search,
and
indeed,
i
don't...
it
does
not
disclose
any
fact.
it
is
completely
blind
until
you
turn
on
your
receiver
and
listen
to
it.
so
i--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--yes,
it
is
addressed
to
that.
and
i
might
note
that
where,
for
instance,
with
aircraft
transponders,
where
you
have
to
enter
the
aircraft
in
order
to
implant
the
device,
we
normally
do
get
a
warrant,
and
we
would
recognize
the
entry
into
the
aircraft
and
the
exposure
to
official
view
of
the
interior
of
the
aircraft
as
being
a
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
is
not
the
same...
there
are
two
differences.
one
is,
the
undercover
agent
sees
an
awful
lot
more
than
this
beeper
discloses.
on
the
other
hand,
the
undercover
agent
is
presumably
there
with
some
kind
of
knowing
consent
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
did
not
have.
that
is,
they
may
not
know
that
he
is
an
undercover
agent.
now,
there
is
an
analogy.
i
mean,
you
might
say
that
they
know
that
this
is
a
can
of
chloroform
that
they
are
taking,
but
they
don't
know
that
it
is
a
disloyal
can
of
chloroform.
i
have
some
difficulty
under
katz
with
the
notion
that
that
argument
would
really
carry
the
day
for
us.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
we
don't
know
whether
it
was
in
the
house
or
not.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
know.
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
heard
it
one
time
when
it
was
somewhere
on
knotts's
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
what
happened
after
that
was,
we
established
visual
surveillance
for
a
couple
of
days
to...
it
is
very
important
in
these
manufacturing
cases--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--to
catch
as
many
conspirators
as
possible
together,
and
because
they
have
to
get
pretty
far
along
before
there
is
a
prosecutable
attempt,
you
preferably
want
to
catch
them
when
they
are
in
the
process
of
manufacturing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
was.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
certainly
say
that
that
would
be
a
different
case,
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
much
stronger
argument
for
the
proposition
that
that
would
be
a
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
would
prefer
to
have
to
argue
that
case
when
it
arose,
but
i
think
a
lot
depends
on
what
information
is
actually
learned,
but
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
will
say
tentatively,
if
i
may,
that
that
is
a
search
subject
to
the
right
to
withdraw
any
such
concession
if
a
case
came
along
and--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
don't
know
enough
about
the
technology
to
know
that,
but
this
case
does
not
involve
learning
anything
except
that
this
container
was
taken
to
knotts's
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
what
i
can
tell
you
about
this
is
that
the
beeper
emits
a
signal
at
regular
intervals,
just
a
blip
that
may
be
at
a
two-second
interval,
and
by
the
strength
and
direction
of
that
signal,
you
can
locate
the...
where
it's
coming
from.
now,
as
i
mentioned
before,
from
ground
surveillance,
normally
it
will
carry
about
two
to
four
miles
in
open
country,
so
that
if...
anybody
who
was
tuned
to
the
right
frequency
within
that
distance
could
pick
up
this
signal.
from
the
air,
i
am
told
20
to
50
miles
is
the
distance
on
which
you
can
monitor
it.
all
you
get
is
blip,
blip,
blip,
which
says,
i
am
here,
i
am
here--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
that's
what...
what
you
do
is
by
the
direction
and
strength
of
the
signal,
you
are
able
to
identify
where
the
signal
is
coming
from.
it
is
like
radar,
i
suppose.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
unless
it
was...
there
was
something
wrong
in
this
case,
because
it
was
an
act
in
furtherance
of
a
conspiracy
to
commit
a
crime,
but
there
is
not
intrinsically
anything
wrong
with
transporting
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
can't...
in
that
sense,
no
crime
occurred
even
when
they
conducted
the
search,
because
the
chloroform
was
still
sitting
there
innocently
under
the
barrel
with
the
laboratory
30
yards
away.
but
there
was
still
a
crime.
the
crime
was
attempted
manufacturing
of
methamphetamine--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--that
crime
took
place
both
in
minnesota
and
in
wisconsin.
i
would
want
to
make
the
point
that
even
perfectly
innocent
activity,
walking
down
the
street
to
have
lunch,
is
subject
without
being
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
visual
surveillance,
bloodhounds,
radar,
night
glasses,
many--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
am
sure
we
would
have
no
occasion
to
do
so.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
just
briefly,
i
want
to
make
an
important
point,
if
i
can
come
to
something
more
mundane
than
my
colleague
closed
on.
if
you
are
going
to
require
a
warrant,
presumably
you
have
determined
that
probable
cause
is
necessary
to
use
this
investigative
technique.
the
problem
you
are
confronted
with
is
like
the
all
or
nothing
problem
in
terry
against
ohio.
if
automatically...
if
you
call
it
a
search,
it
requires
probable
cause,
the
question
is
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
bar
the
government
from
using
this
aid
to
surveillance
techniques,
keeping
in
mind
that
most
kinds
of
physical
surveillance
do
not
require
any
kind
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause.
is
it
reasonable
to
insist
that
the
government
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
is
being
committed
and
that
this
is
being
used,
or
is
it
satisfactory
and
adequately
protective
of
individual
interests,
balancing
the
intrusion
against
the
societal
needs
to
allow
this
to
be
conducted
on
reasonable
suspicion?
that
is
involved
in
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
a
warrant
is
to
be
required.
finally,
if
i
can
come
back
to
the
question
that
justice
stevens
asked
about
the
installation
of
the
beeper,
installation
of
the
beeper
is
not
a
search,
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
seizure.
it
does
not
disclose
to
government
eyes
or
ears
or
knowledge
any
fact,
any
information.
it
is
an
act.
there
are
many
acts
that
the
government
does
xx.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don't
know
whether
if
you
never
turned
it
on
it
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
we
have
not
had
a
case
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
attach
it
to
the
wire
without
listening
to
the
conversations.
if
there
are
no
futher
questions.
