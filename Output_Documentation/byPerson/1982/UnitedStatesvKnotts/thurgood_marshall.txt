--only
fm
can
pick
it
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
beeper
sort
of
ends
up
as
the...
what
do
you
call
it,
the
affidavit
in
a
search
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
beeper
ends
up
as
a
sort
of
affidavit
in
support
of
a
search
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
already
invaded
the
private
property
with
the
beeper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
could
be
argued,
couldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
frey,
i
think
i
misconstrued
it.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
transporting
the
chloroform.
that
wasn't
a
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
transporting
of
chloroform
qua
transporting
chloroform
is
not
a
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
i
was
saying,
the
crime
did
not
occur
any
place
in
minnesota.
no
crime
occurred
in
minnesota.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
went
all
the
way
back
to
minnesota.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
try
any
of
them
on
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
peterson,
help
me
a
little.
why
didn't
you
object
to
putting
the
beeper
in
in
the
first
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that
you
have
no
fourth
amendment
problem
with
the
putting
of
the
beeper
in
the
container.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
your
fourth
amendment
problem
does
not
come
up
until
the
private
home
is
involved.
that
is
your
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
question
is
whether
he
was
living
in
his
factory
or
had
his
factory
in
his
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
looks
to
me
like
he
was
living
in
his
factory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
looks
to
me
like
he
was
living
in
his
factory.
that
is
why
i
was
interested
in
the
question.
is
there
any
way
to
find
that
out?
judging
from
what
you
say,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
peterson,
suppose
these
people
had
put
a
little
gadget
on
this
chloroform
which
when
you
opened
the
can
an
alarm
goes
off.
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
there
is
no
beeper.
this
is
an
alarm.
a
bell
ringing.
