mr.
mark
w.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
before
going
to
the
issues
and
facts
involved
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
identify
two
things
which
in
my
view
represent
the...
or
reflect
the
extreme
position
which
the
government
is
taking
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
in
their
main
brief,
they
assert
that
neither
the
history
nor
the
language
of
the
fourth
amendment
reflects
any
intention
to
require
warrants
as
a
precondition
to
a
lawful
search
and
seizure.
now,
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
imagine
any
constitutional
rule
which
has
been
established
by
this
court
other
than
that
searches
without
warrants
are
per
se
unreasonable,
subject
only
to
a
few
specifically
established
and
well
delineated
exceptions,
none
of
which,
by
the
way,
are
claimed
here.
second,
in
their
reply
brief,
the
government
strongly
criticizes
an
observation
which
we
made
in
our
main
brief
to
the
effect
that
if
this
court
allows
warrantless
beeper
monitoring
in
any
situation,
which
is
in
essence
what
the
government
is
asking
for
here,
that
rule
would
allow
virtually
unlimited
monitoring
of
our
private
lives.
pursuing
that,
in
their
reply
brief,
the
government
suggests
that
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
is
to
divert
the
inquiry
which
is
made
in
this
case
into
a
question
of
potential
for
abuse,
further
accuses
us
of
conjuring
up
what
they
call
a
pessimistic
vision
of
police
activities
which
is
far
removed
from
reality.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
would
not
call
that
an
invasion
of
privacy,
at
least
not
an
illegal--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--no,
it
would
not
have
the
consequences
i
am
arguing
here,
because
that
would
be
a
permissible
police
or
bank
practice
which
would
be
allowed
under
the
exigencies
of
the
situation.
obviously,
when
someone
goes
in
to
rob
a
bank,
whether
it
was
the
bank
or
the
police
officers
responsible
for
placing
this
material
on
the
bills
which
would
end
up
on
the
hands,
there
would
have
been
no
time
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
no
warrant
would
be
possible
in
that
case,
your
honor,
because
once
again
we
would
have
an
exigent
circumstance
where
it
would
not
be
possible
to
obtain
a
warrant.
we
have
conceded
in
this
case
that
following--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--we
would
have
a
more
difficult
case
in
that
instance,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
of
the
fact,
number
one,
the
bag
of
bank
money
would
be
contraband
in
itself.
the
person
who
took
it--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--it
is
stolen
property,
though,
and
in
that
situation
he
would
have
no
right
to
possess
it,
whereas
in
our
situation
here,
the
defendant
had
the
right
to
possess
the
can
of
chloroform.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
he
certainly,
and
again,
we
don't
have
it
in
the
record.
he
certainly
did
not
have
the
right
to
use
chloroform
to
make
methamphetamine
or
amphetamine,
but--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--oh,
certainly
not.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
because
it
is...
stolen
money
is
contraband
per
se.
chloroform
which
is
lawfully
purchased
is
contraband
only
when
it
is
used
for
an
illegitimate
or
illicit
purpose.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
the
money,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
something
which
the
defendant
in
that
case
would
clearly
have
no
right
to
possess.
the
chloroform
here
was
a
material
lawfully
possessed
which
was
subject
to
forfeiture
because
it
could
be
and
obviously
was
going
to
be
utilized
in
the
illegal
drug
factory,
so--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--i
would
submit
that
they
are
not,
your
honor,
because
one
is
contraband
per
se
and
one
is
not.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
if
i
said
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
meant
to
say--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--that
it
is
subject
to
forfeiture,
which
means
that
it
could
have
been
taken
away
from
him
if
it
were
determined
that
it
was
going
to
be
used
for
an
illegal
purpose.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
do
not
challenge
that,
and
for
purposes
of
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
it
makes
any
difference.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
would
imagine
that
they
could,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
the
mere
fact,
justice
o'connor,
that
someone
would
write
down
their
name
and
their
address
and
where
a
particular
chemical
is
going
obviously
does
not
mean
that
it
would
necessarily
end
up
there,
but--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--he
does
not
have
any
greater
interest
than
he
would
have
in
that
situation,
and
the
government
would
still
have
to
get
a
search
warrant
before
they
went
into
his
house
to
seize
those--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--in
the
hypothetical
sense,
that
is
true,
justice
o'connor,
but
in
this
situation,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
shown
to
be
true
by
the
record,
because
as
the
record
will
show
here,
the
reason
that
surveillance
was
terminated
in
the
first
place
was
because
the
co-defendant
was
engaged
in
what
the
agents
determined
to
be
evasive
driving,
and
therefore
they
cut
it
off.
from
that,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
had
they
continued
to
follow
him
as
he
drove
in
the
rural
area
of
wisconsin,
he
probably
never
would
have
gone
to
the
respondent's
home
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
justice
marshall,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
at
what
point--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--no.
i
am
sorry--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--the
reason
that
no
objection
to
installation
of
the
beeper
in
the
drum
of
chemicals
was
made
is
that
it
was
purchased
by
a
second
co-defendant,
then
transferred
to
the
first
co-defendant,
and
therefore
we
would
have
no
"standing"
to
object
to
something
that
happened
to
someone
else's
property.
that
is
why
it
was
not
raised
at
an
earlier
stage.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
the
one
who
actually
bought
the
stuff,
justice
stevens,
was
convicted
by
a
plea
of
guilty.
the
one
who
drove
it
to
my
client's
house
was
found
to
have
no
"standing"
to
object
to
the
search
because
it
wasn't
his
house.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
yes,
it
does,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
it
doesn't
show
whether
it
was
permanent,
justice
blackmun,
but
it
does
show
that
it
was
his
residence.
in
fact,
that
was
conceded
by
the
government
below.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
don't
mean
anything
by
using
different
terms,
justice
blackmun.
i
mean
by
residence
or
premises
a
place
where
a
person
resides,
and
is
clearly
entitled
to
fourth
amendment
protection,
and
we
submit
that
he
was
entitled
to
that
protection
here.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
justice
rehnquist,
the
record
only
shows
that
he
lived
at
this
premises
with
his
wife
as
his
home.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
believe
in
the
district
court's
opinion
which
is
appended
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
it
is
shown
there.
i
don't
believe
in
the
joint
appendix
that
that
particular
fact
is
shown.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
justice
marshall--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--he
had
his
factory
in
his
home,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
justice
marshall.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
yes,
it
does,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
he
might
have.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
that
would
not
be,
justice
stevens.
it
is
clear
that
the
state
narcotics
agents
supplied
the--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--no,
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
you
can
look
at
it
that
way,
because
if
it
arose
in
the
scenario
that
you
have
just
described,
then
we
would
have
no
state
action,
and
therefore
the
fourth
amendment
would
not
be
applicable.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
perhaps
i--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--i
guess
my
only
answer
is
that
i
am
not
so
certain
that
that
would
constitute
state
action,
but
if
it
does
in
the
view
of
the
court,
then
for
the
purposes
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
it
makes
no
difference.
one
thing
the
government
has
claimed
here
in
their
brief
is
that
they
suggest
that
warrants
should
not
be
required
for
beepers
here,
because
in
any
case
the
police
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
in
advance
where
the
beeper
would
end
up.
now,
in
a
vacuum,
that
is
true,
that
the
police
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
where
a
beeper
which
is
installed
either
on
a
car,
in
a
chemical
drum,
or
have
you,
would
end
up,
but
i
think
that
it
is
rather
disingenuous
to
assert
that
here,
because
prior
to
installation
of
the
beeper
in
this
case,
they
had
already
located
one
clandestine
drug
laboratory
at
a
residence,
and
two,
they
obviously
know
that
most
people
who
engage
in
this
type
of
activity
do
not
manufacture
their
product
in
a
public
place.
we
are
submitting
that
the
result
which
we
seek
in
this
case
would
not
prevent
the
warrantless
use
of
beepers
only
to
assist
surveillance
which
is
generally
the
use
to
which
beepers
are
put.
our
only
contention
is
that
if
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
item
to
which
a
beeper
is
attached
on
or
installed
in
is
likely
to
end
up
at
a
person's
residence,
then
a
warrant
is
required.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
believe
that
would
be
the--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--normally
when
a
beeper
is
installed
in
a
chemical
drum
or
what
have
you,
they
already
have
previous
knowledge
that
someone
who
is
apparently
involved
in
illegal
drug
activity
is
going
to
pick
it
up.
therefore,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
warrant
were
obtained
prior
to
the
time
that
that
person
came
to
pick
it
up
or
at
the
time
of
the
transfer
to
that
person.
the
same
type
of
limitations
and
presumably
the
same
type
of
probable
cause
for
installation
of
the
beeper
would
obtain.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
there
is
none,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
once
again,
these
cases
do
not
arise
generally
or
at
least
in
my
experience
until
the
agents
already
have
some
substantial
information
that
one
or
more
people
are
apparently
engaged
in
the
illegal
manufacturing
of
drugs,
or
at
least
they
are
purchasing
large
quantities
of
chemicals
which
are
consistent
with
the
manufacture
of
drugs.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
our
contention
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
they
should
get
a
warrant
and
the
constitution
requires
them
to
get
a
warrant
if
they
are
going
to
use
the
beeper
which
has
been
installed
either
to
determine
the
location
of
non-contraband
property
at
a
person's
residence
or
to
monitor
its
continued
presence
at
that
location.
those
are
the
circumstances
under
which
we
are--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--i
am
not
aware
of
any
such
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
think
it
is
fundamentally
different,
mr.
chief
justice,
because--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
again,
this
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
you
can
follow
vehicles,
whether
they
be
airplanes
or
automobiles,
in
a
public
space,
in
this
case
public
air
space,
because
there
is
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
as
you
are
traveling
in
that
particular
area.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
i
have
to
admit--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--pardon
me?
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
well,
there
certainly
are
a
number
of
similarities.
the
case
that
you
have
posed
would
be
a
far
more
difficult
one
for
me
to
argue
than
this
case
is,
but
i
still
would
submit
that
there
is
a
colorable
claim
that
even
in
that
hangar,
assuming
that
it
was
the
person's
living
quarters,
he
would
have
a
colorable
claim
of
fourth
amendment
protection.
i
would
like
to
comment
just
briefly
on
a
couple
of
things
that
came
up
during
the
government's
argument.
first,
mr.
frey
has
asserted
that
in
cases
like
this,
in
other
words,
drug
manufacturing
cases,
beepers
are
essential.
i
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
accuracy
of
that
statement,
but
that
certainly
is
no
justification
and
no
reason
for
claiming
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
warrant.
secondly,
the
government
asserts
that
all
that
was
learned
through
use
of
the
beeper
was
that
mr.
petschen
went
to
the
cabin
after
they
lost
surveillance
contact
with
him.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
this
case,
the
basis
of
the
search
warrant
was
the
fact
that
the
beeper
drum
had
been...
had
become
stationary
at
the
respondent's
residence,
and
that
was
one
of
the
bases
upon
which
they
obtained
the
warrant.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
do
not
necessarily
concede
that
merely
because
petschen
may
have
arrived
at
knotts'
property,
even
assuming
that
the
state
agent
saw
that,
that
that
would
have
established
probable
cause.
one
thing
that
also
came
up
during
the
government's
argument
in
questioning
by
justice
o'connor,
your
questions
to
the
effect
that,
does
it
make
any
difference
where
the
beeper
drum
is
located
on
the
property
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
constitutional
protection.
it
would
be
our
position
in
this
case
that
once
the
drum
was
on
the
curtilage
of
this
property,
which,
as
the
record
shows,
contained
no
trespassing
signs
on
the
front
and
was
in
a
secluded
area,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
drum
was
located
inside
the
house,
close
to
the
house,
or
any
place
else
in
the
curtilage.
it
seems
clear--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--that's
what
the
hester
case
says,
your
honor,
and
i
am
not
really
sure
whether
the
rule
which
was
announced
in
hester
has
really
survived
the
decision
of
this
court
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
it
is
generally
cited
for
the--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--by
the
courts
which
cite
it.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
oh,
certainly
not,
justice
rehnquist.
i
was
just
indicating
that
hester
is
generally
cited
for
the
open
fields
doctrine,
and
i
haven't
seen
anything
in
this
court's
decision
which
has
dealt
with
the
trespassory
aspects
of
that
case
where
the
ir
agents
assumedly
trespassed
when
they
were
on
mr.
hester's
property
and
observed
the
conduct
between
hester
and
another
that
they
observed.
the
reason
i
suggest
that
i
am
not
sure
that
the
trespassory
part
of
hester
has
survived
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire
is
because
in
that
case,
this
court
dealt
with,
among
other
things,
the
search
of
the
automobile
which
was
located
in
plain
view--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--for
this
proposition,
i
do,
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
language
in
that
opinion
to
the
effect
that
absent
exigent
circumstances,
you
cannot
go
on
private
property
to
conduct
a
search
without
a
warrant,
and
it
makes
no
difference
how
much
probable
cause
you
have
got,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
that
language
has
not
been
disapproved
by
this
court.
the
government
also
takes
the
position
in
this
case
that
just
because
the
beeper
says,
here
i
am,
and
nothing
more,
that
the
invasion
of
privacy,
if
any,
which
occurs
is
thereby
minimal,
and
it
should
not
be
called
a
search,
and
no
search
warrant
should
be
required.
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
"here
i
am"
is
exactly
what
the
invasion
of
privacy
is
about.
it
is
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
and
it
means
that
the
government
cannot
find
out
either
what
you
are
doing
or
what
you
are
possessing
on
your
premises
without
a
judge
authorizing
them
to
do
so,
and
i--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--they
would
ask
for
permission
to
monitor
the
travels
of
the
item
to
which
the
beeper
is
attached.
they
might
also
ask
to
monitor
the
location
of
the
item.
whether
or
not
they
would
ask
for
that,
i
don't
know,
but
there
might
be
some
difficulties
in
a
judge
authorizing
that
without
some
showing
that
the
location
was
likely
to
be
a
place
where
criminal
activity
was
involved.
obviously,
the
issuing
magistrate
would
have
to
put
a
time
limit
upon
the
beeper,
the
permissible
time
for
monitoring,
whether
it
could
be
used
for
just...
just
to
assist
surveillance
or
location
monitoring
as
well.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
correct.
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
and
the
beeper
which
was--
mr.
mark
w.
peterson
--as
long
as
the
chemical
drum
was
located
at
the
respondent's
residence,
and
obviously
that
there
is
no
warrant,
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
because
once
again
the
government
is
learning
something
about
you
that
it
has
no
right
to
learn
without
a
warrant.
and
i
assume
in
that
case
if
the
alarm
went
off,
that
would
show
that
you
were
using
the
chemical
drum
for...
or
at
least
opening
it
presumably
for
illegal
purposes,
and
i
think
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
under
that
situation
as
well.
in
conclusion,
ever
since
this
court's
decision
in
boyd
versus
the
united
states,
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
primarily
enacted
to
protect
the
citizens'
indefeasible
right
of
personal
security,
personal
liberty,
and
private
property.
in
his
famous
dissent
in
the
olmstead
case,
justice
brandeis
elaborated
on
the
concept
of
privacy
in
dissenting
over
the
warrantless
use
of
electronic
surveillance.
he
wrote
essentially
that
whenever
and
however
the
government
unjustifiably
intrudes
upon
a
citizen's
privacy,
the
fourth
amendment
is
violated.
now,
ever
since
olmstead,
much
constitutional
doctrine
has
changed,
but
i
don't
think
the
wisdom
of
justice
brandeis's
dissent
has,
and
neither
has
the
rule
that
searches
without
warrants
are
presumptively
invalid.
we
submit
that
what
took
place
in
this
case
was
a
search,
that
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing
it
from
any
other
search
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
minimally
intrusive,
and
therefore
a
warrant
should
have
been
required.
thank
you.
