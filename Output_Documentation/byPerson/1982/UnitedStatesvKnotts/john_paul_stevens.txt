justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
it
is
not
just
a
matter
of
distance,
but
it
is
a
direct
line
from
the
transmitter
to
the
receiver,
so
if
you
had
obstacles
in
the
way--
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
go
on
to
the
second
issue,
mr.
frey--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
ask
you
this
question?
you
have
described
it
as
though
the
question
is
whether
the
monitoring
of
the
beeper
is
the
focus
of
the
inquiry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
we
focused
instead
on
the
question
of
whether
the
installation
of
the
beeper
was
not
the
act
which
gives
rise
to
the
question
whether
there
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
of
some
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
confining
it
to
container
beepers
for
the
moment,
would
your
argument
be
just
as
strong,
do
you
think,
if
instead
of
having
the
consent
of
the
manufacturer
and
so
forth,
you
had
waited
until
there
had
been
a
transfer
of
title
to
the
purchaser,
and
then
somehow
it
was
left
in
an
abandoned
place
and
an
agent
was
able
to
insert
a
beeper.
would
you
say
that
would
be
the
same
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
did
not.
assume
there
is
some
way
to
stick
it
on
the
bottom
or
something.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it
would
be
the
same
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
difference
is,
in
the
automobile
it
is
not
going
to
go
in
anybody's
home,
whereas
by
hypothesis
this
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
learned
here
by
using
the
beeper
that
the
chemicals
went
into
this
cabin,
i
guess
it
was,
and
you
are
pretty
sure--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
the
information
gained
by
use
of
the
beeper
plus
your
additional
information
was
rather
persuasive
that
the
thing
was
inside
the
cabin.
i
mean,
because
you
had
probable
cause
to
go
in
the
cabin.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
how
you
got
the
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
i
am
leading
up
to
is
whether...
i
wonder
whether
you
think,
given
all
the
information
you
had,
at
the
time
the
beeper
was
installed,
you
might
have
then
gotten
a
warrant
which
would
authorize
an
entry
into
the
place
where
the
container
went.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
too
often,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
when
you
say
holding
this
to
be
a
search,
you
are
saying
holding
the
monitoring
of
the
beeper
as
opposed
to
the
installation
of
the
beeper.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
argument
is
directed
to
the
case
in
which
we
assume
sort
of
as
a
starting
premise
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
installation,
it
is
just
how
long
can
you
listen
to
it,
and
when,
if
ever,
does
listening
to
it
become
a
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
is
an
adequate
answer,
because
he
was
held
not
to
have
any
standing,
either.
in
fact,
he
was
convicted,
wasn't
he,
because
he...
the
one
who
actually
bought
the
stuff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back,
please,
to
justice
marshall's
question
of
a
moment
ago,
about
you
are
not
challenging
installation
itself?
is
it
correct
then
that
for
purposes
of
our
analysis,
we
should
take
the
case
as
though
someone
without
any
government
participation
at
all
had
placed
the
beeper
on
the
can,
say
a
volunteer
working
for
the
chemical
company,
who
later
on
told
the
police
officers,
i
was
suspicious
of
these
people,
and
i
put
a
beeper
on
it,
and
then
the
question
is,
the
monitoring
is
the
only
issue.
would
that
be
a
fair
analysis?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
know
they
in
fact
did
it.
i
am
not
questioning
that.
but
i
mean
for
purposes
of
your
fourth
amendment
claim,
which
as
i
understand
your
response
to
justice
marshall,
arises
after
the
beeper
was
installed,
and
therefore
involves
no
attack
on
the
installation
of
the
beeper
itself.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
must
be
the
same
as
if
an
innocent
third
party
put
it
on
and
later
told
the
police,
this
is
what
i
have
done,
if
you
want
to
follow
this
thing,
go
ahead
and
listen
to
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
have
state
action.
they
have
listened.
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
listening
when
the
monitor...
when
the
device
goes
inside
a
private
premises,
it
is
actually
out
in
front,
i
guess,
but
that
that
is
the
search
that
troubled
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
state
action.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
about
that.
they
followed
it,
and
they
turned
on
the
right
frequency,
and
they
kept
track
of
it,
and
sent
an
airplane
to
look
for
it,
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
in
that...
if
you
had...
if
we
had
a
warrant
requirement
for
this
sort
of
thing,
what
exactly
would
the
government
ask
for
permission
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
neither
does
installing
a
wire
tap.

paul
