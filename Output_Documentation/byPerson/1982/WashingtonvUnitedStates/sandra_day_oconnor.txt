on
the

so
if
the
state
itself
were
building
it
is
treated
like
a
private
citizen
would
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
that
sense
the
state
tax
is
discriminating
against
contractors
with
the
federal
government,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra

o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
the
moses
lake
homes
and
phillips
chemical
company
cases
that
are
relied
upon
by
the
solicitor
general?
justice
sandra

o'connor
mr.
smith,
if
the
tax
here,
instead
of
requiring
the
owner
of
the
property
to
pay
a
tax
based
on
the
full
contract
price,
had
a
separate
sales
tax,
one
on
the
owner
for
the
labor
involved
and
one
on
the
contractor
for
the
cost
of
materials
incorporated
in
the
project,
and
the
tax
on
the
federal
contractors
remained
the
same
as
it
is
now,
i
assume
you
would
say
that's
constitutional.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
that
assumption
it
would
be--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it
would
be
fine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
smith,
in
the
county
of
fresno
we
have
exactly
the
same
situation
we
have
here.
the
tax
was
placed
on
renters
who
rented
from
the
federal
government,
and
we
got
around
that
in
county
of
fresno
by
making
certain
assumptions
about
who
was
going
to
bear
the
economic
burden.
why
can't
we
make
the
same
assumptions
here
and
assume
that,
for
instance,
that
the
tax
couldn't
be
shifted
from
the
federal
contractor
to
the
federal
government
itself?
