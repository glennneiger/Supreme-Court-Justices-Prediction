i
take
it
when
you...
the
contractor
adds
that
to
his
price
to
the
owner,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
then
he
hasn't
paid
his
sales
tax
on
his
bricks,
i
take
it;
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
contractor
hasn't
paid
a
tax
when
he
buys
his
bricks?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
well,
a
while
ago
you
said
that
when
a
contractor
buys
bricks
or
his
materials
he
pays
a
tax.
well,
he
doesn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
private
contractor
does
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
isn't
when
they
sell
to
a
private
contractor.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
not
paying
that
tax.
general
eikenberry,
if
the
state
itself
or
one
of
the
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
is
building
a
construction
project,
what
is
the
tax
in
that
instance.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
federal
contractor
could
pass
it
on
to
the
federal
government
in
terms
of
his
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
the
federal
contractor
nevertheless
has
to
put
out
the
money
when
he
buys,
five
or
six
percent
more
when
he
buys
his
materials.
he's
going
to
need
more
working
capital
in
that
respect.
as
he
goes
along,
he's
going
to
perhaps
have
progress
payments.
but
beyond
that,
he
won't
be
treated
the
same
economically
unless
he
can
get
the
money
from
the
federal
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
it
and
then
he's
going
to
risk
whether
or
not
he
can...
how
much
of
it
he
can
get
from
the
federal
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
if
you're
right
couldn't
the
state
of
washington
say
with
respect
to
federal
contractors,
we're
going
to
put
a
five
percent
tax
on
you
measured
by
the
contract
price
to
the
government,
and
we're
not
putting
the
legal
incidence
on
the
government;
you
can
do
what
you
want
to.
you
can
try
to
get
the
money
back
from
the
government
or
not.
but
anyway,
you
have
a
tax
on
you
for
the
full
amount
of
the
contract
price,
just
like
it's
placed
on
private
contractors.
the
only
thing
there
is
that
we
make
them
pass
it
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
applied
solely
to
federal
contractors?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
say...
your
argument
is
that
really
in
effect,
that
your
sales
tax
is
a
comparable
tax
the
way
you
now
arrange
it,
namely
five
percent
added
to
the
contract
price
that
the
owner
must
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
you
agree
that
if
your
argument's
right
washington
could
put
whatever
your
rate
is,
a
five
percent
tax,
on
the
contract
price
of
the
government
contractor?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
you
didn't
attempt
to
put
the
legal
incidence
on
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aren't
they
required
to
pass
it
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
falls
on
the
owner.
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
of
the
economic
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
federal
government
contractor,
the
whole
transaction
of
contracting
with
the
federal
government,
will
suffer
a
lesser
economic
burden
than
the
state
contractors?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
your
position?
that's
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
call
it
discriminatory?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
discriminatory.
it's
discriminatory
against
the
state
and
private
contractors.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
puts
a
lesser
burden
on
the
federal
government
than
it
does
on
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
discriminatory
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
if
they
treated
all
contractors
alike
and
just
put
a
sales
tax
on
the
purchases
of
a
contractor
from
all
of
his
suppliers
and
left
it
up
to
the
contractor
to
pass
it
on
to
his
owner
if
he
could,
the
fact
that
the
united
states
would
end
up
paying
the
tax
would
not
invalidate
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the...
even
though
now
the
burden
on
the
federal
government,
if
you
accept,
if
you
accepted
the
washington
tax,
is
no
greater.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
burden...
that's
an
economic
burden
argument
you're
making
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
a
description
of
how
they're
treated
differently?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
the
government
got
into
this
case
only
because
it
reimbursed
and
then
sued
for
a
refund,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
assume?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
did
reimburse
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we're
talking
about
a
case
where
the
contractor
suffered
no
economic
burden
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
a
lot
like
your
brief
in
fresno.
