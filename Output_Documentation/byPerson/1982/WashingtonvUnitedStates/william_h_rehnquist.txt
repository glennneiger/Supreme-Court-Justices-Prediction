justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
a
building
project.
and
with
respect
to
private
and
state
contracts,
the
state
taxes
the
contract
price
at
the
time
the
contractor
delivers
possession
to
the
owner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
the
concern
of
the
court,
at
least
in
phillips
and
perhaps
in
moses
lake
too,
that
the
state
treated
contractors
dealing
with
the
state
more
favorably
than
contractors
dealing
with
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
analyzing
the
washington...
the
economic
burdens
of
the
washington
transaction,
it
can
be
fairly
said
that
washington,
that
the
state
of
washington
treats
those
contracting
with
the
federal
government
less
favorably
than
those
contracting
with
the
state
of
washington?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
less
favorably.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
eikenberry,
what
is
washington
law
with
respect
to
the
obligation,
duty
of
a
contractor
with
the
state
to
pass
along
the
sales
tax?
is
that
simply
a
question
of
the
bargaining
between
the
parties?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
i
wanted
to
ask,
if
contractors
with
the
state
government
and
private
contractors
are
treated
alike,
what
is
the
law
with
respect
to
the
contractor's
duty
to
pay
and
the
permissibility
of
his
passing
along
the
tax
to
the
ultimate
owner,
whether
it's
the
state
or
a
private
entity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
perhaps
we
haven't
been
as
explicit
in
our
questions,
or
perhaps
you
haven't
been
as
explicit
in
your
answers.
if
i'm
a
contractor
in
the
state
of
washington
and
i
contract
with
the
alpha
delta
retirement
home
to
build
a
retirement
home
for
them,
does
washington
state
law
impair
in
any
way
the
freedom
of
bargaining
between
me
as
contractor
and
the
alpha
delta
retirement
home
as
to
who
shall
bear
the
incidence
of
the
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
which
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
owner
who
is
getting
the
building
from
the
contract.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
how
does
the
state...
it's
not,
then,
a
tax
on
doing
business,
the
way
a
sales
tax
is;
it's
a
use
tax
on
the
use
of
the
property
by
the
owner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
the
state
collect
that
from
an
owner?
the
contractor
is
supposed
to
collect
it,
isn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
contractor
is
actually
the
entity
through
which
the
tax
department
of
the
state
of
washington
collects
the
tax,
even
though
you
say
the
legal
incidence
is
on
the
owner.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
hold
the
contractor
liable
if
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
owner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
as
a
practical
matter,
it's
really
the
contractor
that
pays.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
use
the
term
"circumvent
the
immunity
of
the
united
states.
"
mr.
smith.
if
the
washington
legislature
looked
around
and
said,
look,
there
are
some
people
contracting
with
the
federal
government
who
we
think
the
decisional
law
will
let
us
tax,
but
our
tax
structure
just
isn't
framed
to
get
that
tax,
so
let's
change
it
to
tax
what
we
can,
would
you
say
that
was
a
desire
to
circumvent
the
immunity
of
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
some
ways
they
can
circumvent
it
and
other
ways--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
difference
between
tax
evasion
and
tax
avoidance?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
one
might
fairly
say
your
argument
is
reminiscent
of
a
good
deal
of
the
decisional
law
of
this
court
before
james
versus
dravo
and
king
&
boozer,
where
it
was
simply
an
exultation
of
form
over
substance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hasn't
miller
versus
milwaukee
been
rather
substantially
limited
by
comments
in
later
opinions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
part
of
the
washington
state
sales
tax
system
is
unconstitutional.
the
washington
sales
tax
law
treats
most
sales
of
construction
project
as
retail
sales
and
requires
the
buyer
for
whom
the
project
is
built
to
pay
the
tax.
the
law
treats
sales
of
materials
to
contractors
as
wholesale
sales
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
require
anyone
to
pay
tax
on
most
transactions.
the
system
doesn't
work
the
way
washington
wants
it
to
when
the
federal
government
buys
a
construction
project,
because
this
court
is
long
held
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
forbids
the
state
from
imposing
a
tax
directly
on
united
states.
therefore,
washington
is
required
that
contractors
who
work
for
the
federal
government
to
pay
sales
tax
on
the
material
they
buy.
thus,
when
a
construction
project
is
built
for
a
private
party,
the
buyer
pay
sales
tax
on
the
entire
cost
of
the
project
and
the
contractor
pays
no
tax,
but
when
the
construction
project
is
built
for
the
federal
government,
the
contractor
pays
sales
tax
on
the
cost
of
the
materials
but
the
united
states,
which
is
the
buyer,
pays
no
tax.
the
united
states
sued
washington
in
the
federal
district
court
of
seattle
claiming
that
the
sales
tax
on
contractors
discriminates
against
the
united
states
and
contractors
it
worked
for
in
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
the
district
court
agreed
with
united
states.
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
washington
appealed
to
this
court
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
as
we
explain
more
fully
in
the
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
washington
statute
is
constitutional
because
it
does
not
discriminate
against
the
united
states.
federal
constitution
projects
are
taxed
with
the
same
rate
as
private
project
and
the
tax
is
imposed
only
on
the
cost
of
materials
instead
of
on
the
whole
shebang.
since
the
federal
government
and
contractors
who
worked
for
had
pay
less
sales
tax
than
anyone
else
who
build
the
project
in
washington,
they're
not
only
not
discriminated
against,
they're
better
off.
washington
is
simply
accommodated
for
the
fact
that
it
is
not
permitted
to
tax
the
federal
government
directly.
we
hold
that
it
may
do
this
without
running
afoul
of
the
supremacy
clause.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
white,
marshall,
and
stevens
joined.
