mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
there
is
a
fundamental
tenet
in
our
constitution
providing
for
the
immunity
of
the
federal
government
absolutely
from
state
taxation.
mcculloch
established
that
federal
tax
immunity,
as
chief
justice
marshall
said,
is
the
unavoidable
consequence
of
that
supremacy
which
the
constitution
has
declared.
now,
we
all
agree
that
mcculloch
established
that
the
states
cannot
lay
a
direct
tax
upon
the
united
states.
but
there
is
an
important
corollary
to
that
doctrine
which
is
equally
unquestioned.
it
is,
as
the
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions,
that
a
tax
may
be
invalid,
even
though
it
does
not
fall
directly
upon
the
united
states,
if
it
operates
so
as
to
discriminate
against
the
government
or
those
with
whom
it
deals.
the
court
said
that
in
the
united
states
versus
city
of
detroit
and
has
reaffirmed
that
in
phillips
chemical
company,
moses
lake
homes,
and
a
whole
host
of
precedents.
this
corollary
is
essential
to
the
integrity
of
the
federal
tax
immunity
principle,
because
otherwise
the
very
functioning
of
the
federal
government
would
be
impaired.
for
example,
if
a
state
attempted
to
tax
the
income
solely
of
federal
employees,
that
tax
would
be
indisputably
invalid.
but
an
income
tax
laid
upon
all
residents
of
the
state,
which
includes
federal
employees,
would
be
constitutional,
as
indeed
this
court
held
in
graves
ex
rel.
versus
o'keefe.
so
the
rule
that
has
emerged
in
more
recent
terms
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
that
the
economic
burden
on
a
federal
function
of
a
state
tax
imposed
upon
those
who
deal
with
the
federal
government
renders
the
tax
invalid
if
it
is
not
imposed
equally
on
the
other
similarly
situated
constituents
of
the
state.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
identified
the
washington
sales
tax
at
issue
here
as
a
classic
example
of
discriminatory
taxation.
all
will
agree,
and
the
state
indeed
properly
concedes,
that
the
washington
legislature
engaged
in
a
purposeful
attempt
to
circumvent
the
immunity
of
the
united
states.
the
statutory
history--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--it
would
be
an
attempt
to
do
it,
but
our
view
is
that
they
haven't
done
it
correctly
here
under
the
precedents
of
the
united
states.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
the
important
thing,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
federal
contractors
be
treated
the
same
as
all
other
contractors.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
under
that
assumption
that
would
be
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
other
words,
so
that
the
federal
government's
immunity
would
prevent
the
state
from
imposing
a
tax
on
the...
you
know,
on
the
contractor's
profit,
you
know,
which
would
be
the
cost
borne
by
the
federal
government.
but
the
statutory
history
reveals
that
that
really,
and
the
statute
indicates,
that
that
really
isn't
what
happened
here,
because
in
1935
when
this
tax
was
enacted
the
tax
was
on,
the
washington
sales
tax,
was
on
sales
to
building
contractors.
that
is,
to
use
the
attorney
general's
example,
if
a
contractor
purchased
a
nail
or
some
other
component
that
went
into
a
house
from
a
hardware
company,
that
contractor
would
have
to
pay
the
sales
tax.
all
contractors
would
pay
that
sales
tax,
whether...
no
matter
whom
they
dealt
with,
the
federal
government,
the
state
government,
or
a
private
party.
the
tax
was
imposed
on
contractors.
in
1941
the
state
wanted
to...
the
state
changed
the
tax,
and
what
it
did
was
it
changed
the
tax
to
sales
by
contractors,
so
that
the
tax
began
to
be
paid
by
consumers.
now,
the
state
did
this
legitimately
in
order
to
increase
its
tax
base,
in
order
to
include
the
contractor's
profit
in
the
tax
base.
but
because
it
did
this
and
imposed
the
tax
at
the
customer
level,
of
course,
the
federal
government
was
a
customer;
all
those
transactions
became
immune
under
the
absolute
immunity
of
the
federal
government
that
this
court
has
never
questioned.
so
now,
for
more
than
30
years
the
state
was
apparently
content
with
this
choice,
that
is,
an
enhanced
tax
base
in
the
private
and
state
sphere,
gaining
enhanced
revenues
from
these
sources
at
the
price
of
sacrificing...
and
indeed,
at
the
constitutional
price
of
sacrificing
revenue
from
federal
government
contractors.
and
in
1975
it
saw
that,
when
federal
construction
activity
in
the
state
of
washington
became
greater
and
more
intense,
the
state
sought
to
include
somehow
the
federal
government's
contracting
activity
in
its
tax
base,
while
retaining
the
enhanced
tax
base
on
private
construction.
the
state
did
not
want
to
give
up
that
aspect
of
its
tax
law.
so
in
1975
the
state
amended
its
sales
tax
to
impose,
as
we
have
it
now,
a
tax
upon
contractors
for
the
united
states,
but
not
upon
other
contractors.
now,
there's
no
doubt,
indeed,
that
this...
these
amendments
intended
to
circumvent
the
federal
tax
immunity.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that,
the
staff
reports
indicate
it,
that
there
some
question
as
to
whether
this
was
discriminatory
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
indeed
the
state
so
acknowledges
that
intent.
now,
in
our
view
these
1975
amendments
effectively
single
out
the
federal
government's
contractors
for
state
taxation,
and
therefore
runs
afoul
of
the
discrimination
corollary
under
the
immunity--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--regardless
of
the
economic
effect.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that's
true,
regardless
of
that
effect.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
our
position,
and
we
think
it's
a
position
which
is
supported
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
because
rather
than
engaging
in...
the
supremacy
clause,
as
this
court
has
interpreted
it
countless
times,
presuppose...
indicates
the
founding
fathers'
attempt
to
avoid
this
clash
of
sovereigns,
clash
of
sovereigns
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
government.
and
because
of
that,
the
supremacy
clause
betrays
this
apt
principle
that
the
federal
government
and
those
with
whom
it
deals
cannot
be
singled
out
for
discriminatory
taxation.
now,
in
our--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--well,
it
is--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--it's
different,
but--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--indeed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
i
think
as
the
court
indicated
in
county
of
fresno
in
describing
the
mcculloch
rationale,
the
court
said
if
the
state's
power
to
tax
the
bank
were
recognized
in
principle,
the
court
doubted
the
ability
of
federal
courts
to
review
each
exercise
of
such
power
to
determine
whether
the
tax
would
or
would
not
destroy
a
federal
function.
the
important
thing,
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
here,
is
that
once
you
have...
once
you
have
a
state
legislature's
identification
of
federal
activity
for
different
tax
treatment,
that
that
indicates
a
potential
for
abuse
which
triggers
the
application
of
the
immunity
clause.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
whether
discriminatory
or
not.
and
in
our
view
this
fits
in
perfectly,
fits
in
appropriately,
with
the
court's...
with
the
entire
panoply
of
decisions
which
examine
the
state
taxes
in
terms
of
where
the
legal
incidence
is
imposed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
that
was
the
situation
in
1935,
and
that
really
flows
from
the
court's
statement
in
king
&
boozer.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed.
but
you
know,
that
argument--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--it's
just
different.
but
that
argument
is
frighteningly
reminiscent
of
what
the
state
of
maryland
must
have
argued
before
the
court
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland.
it
said:
trust
us;
we're
not
going
to
make
this
that
onerous
or
difficult.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
is
that
we
are
examining
here
where
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
falls.
it's
a
tax,
it's
a
sales
tax
which
is
imposed
only
on
federal
contractors.
and
we
look
around
and
say
to
ourselves,
if
company
a
goes
into
the
state
of
washington
and
it
engages
in
a
federal
contract,
it
has
to
pay
this
tax
and
it
has
to,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
put
up
this
money
up
front
and
whether
it
gets
back
the
money
or
not
is
really
wholly
problematic.
and
if
it
does
business
with
a
private
party
it
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax.
now,
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--no,
it
isn't.
it
is
not
an
economic
burden
argument.
in
our
view
it
is
an
examination
of
where
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
falls.
i
have
no
quarrel--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--it's
a
description
of
how
they're
treated
differently.
and
indeed,
as
i
think
the
court
indicated
in
county
of
fresno,
once
the
principle
is
breached
this
different
treatment
indicates
that,
you
know,
the
constitutional
principle
is
also
breached.
and
in
our
view
this--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
think
that
kind
of
assumption...
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
parts.
i
think,
to
begin
with,
the
assumption
that
the
court
engaged
in
in
county
of
fresno,
equating
the
renters
in
private
property
with
the
forest
service
rangers,
was
an
appropriate,
an
arguably
appropriate
analogy
between
two
parties
who
occupied
similar
positions
in
the
economic
spectrum,
that
is,
renters
of
property.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
is
attempting
to
save
its
tax
by
pointing
to
the
customers,
the
private
customers,
and
saying,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
fact
that
we're
not
taxing
the
private
contractors
because
we're
taxing
the
private
customers.
the
private
customers
are
not
comparable
to
contractors.
they're
really
quite
different.
and
the
point...
in
response
on
another
level,
justice
o'connor,
let
me
simply
say
that
that
argument,
the
point
is
that
somehow
it's
all
going
to
work
out
because
the
customers
are
bearing
the
tax,
i
think
places
unnecessary
or
improper
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
these
taxpayers
here
are
projects,
they
are
construction
projects.
the
taxpayers
in
this
case,
in
these
cases,
are
not
projects;
they
are
parties.
and
in
this
particular
instance
we
have
a
situation
where
the
contractor
who
deals
with
the
federal
government
is
subject
to
tax
and
the
contractor
who
deals
with
a
private
party
and
the
state
is
not
subject
to
tax.
in
fact,
the
state
responds
by
saying,
as
you've
suggested,
that
the
discriminatory
treatment
could
be
cured
simply
if
the
united
states
would
reimburse
its
contractors.
but
really,
that
turns
the
immunity
principle
on
its
head.
it
identifies
the
federal
tax
immunity,
the
absolute
immunity
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
indicated
it
has
never
questioned,
as
the
cause
of
the
discriminatory
treatment
here.
the
immunity
is
not
the
problem,
we
submit.
it
is
the
first
principle
that's
to
be
considered,
the
unavoidable
consequence
of
that
supremacy
that
the
constitution
has
declared.
we
think
that
the
state
cannot
seek
to
identify
the
federal
government's
either
refusal
or
disinclination
to
reimburse
its
contractors
as
an
affirmative
justification
for
its
invalid
discriminatory
or
indeed
different
treatment
of
federal
contractors.
and--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
assume
so,
i
assume
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
assume
that
the
government...
although
i
suppose
that
the
government...
the
government
is
a
party
in
this
case.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
government
has
reimbursed
it,
but
i
assume
that
that's
probably
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
probably
right.
but
again--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--but
again,
justice
white,
i
don't
think
that
we
can...
i
don't
think
that
we
can
assume
that
the
federal...
to
assume
that
the
federal
government
will
make
that
kind
of
reimbursement
is
in
effect
to
really,
you
know,
make
a
farce
of
the
federal
government's
immunity.
because
if
you
structure
a
state's
taxing
statute
on
the
assumption
that
the
federal
government
will
make
this
contribution
and
that's
the
way
we're
going
to
achieve
equal
treatment,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
immunity
principle
is
seriously
threatened.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i
don't
think
it
sounds
like
my
brief
in
fresno,
for
one
simple
reason.
i
think
that
the
court
will
recall
fresno,
in
fresno
the
principal
argument
we
made
was
that
the
tax
on
the
forest
ranger's
possessory
interest
endangered
and
impaired
the
ability
of
him
to
discharge
his
duties.
and
the
court
indicated
that
there
could
be
a
segregation,
a
separation
of
his
private
residential
aspect,
of
his
house,
with
the
court's...
you
know,
with
the
taxation
of
his
axe,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
so
i
think
the
cases
are
really
quite
different.
but
i
think
that
the
fresno
principle
is
something
that
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
identified
as
the
appropriate
rule
on
which
to
invalidate
this
tax.
that
is,
that
you
can't
treat
those
who
deal
with
the
federal
government
differently
than
those
who
deal
with
other
parties,
that
that
difference
in
treatment
triggers
the
kinds...
the
clash
of
sovereigns
that
the
supremacy
clause
was
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
does.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
save
it,
only
because
you
then
would
have...
you
then
have
to
examine
whether
it
included
a
sufficient
number
of
similarly
situated
constituents
within
the
tax
to
protect
the
federal
government.
in
fact,
the
dissenting
opinion...
the
dissenting
opinion
in
montana
versus
united
states
really
sort
of
raises
that
problem,
although
it
was--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--talking
about
the
merits,
it
was
talking
about
the
merits
of
a
case
that
the
court
never
reached.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
let
me
simply
say
that
i
think
that
when
you're
talking
about
who
is
a
similarly
situated
constituent
you
have
to,
i
think,
start
from
the
notion
that
the
federal
government
is
entitled
to
a
full
measure
of
protection
and
the
inclusion
of
all
similarly
situated
constituents.
because
i
don't...
i
think
it
would
be...
i
would
counsel
against
the
court
engaging
in
a
kind
of
quantification
of
how
much
is
enough.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
supremacy
clause,
if
it's
going
to
have
any
meaning,
has
to
protect
the
government
by...
in
other
words,
the
notion
should
not
be
that
these
people
have
sufficient
political
clout
and
these...
and
that
will
carry
the
day,
because
those
things
are
terribly
ephemeral.
i
think
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view
the
federal
government
has
to
be
protected
by
including
all
similarly
situated
people
within
the
tax,
and
that
in
our
view
here
means
the
contractors,
and
that,
the
absence
of
the
contractors
here
which
deal
with
the
state
and
with
private
parties,
is
glaringly
absent.
if
the
state
wants
to
return
to
1935,
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
that.
if
it
wants
to
impose
a
tax
based
on
the
gross
receipts
of
all
contractors,
james
versus
dravo
contracting
company
establishes
the
validity
of
that
kind
of
tax.
but
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
really
wants
to
have
it
both
ways.
it
wants
its
enhanced
tax
revenue
from
the
enhanced
base
in
the
private
sphere,
but
it
also
wants
to
catch
the
federal
contracts.
and
in
our
view
it
can't
do
that
in
this
context.
and
in
that
respect,
i
simply
want
to
identify,
we
talked
at
the
beginning
about
purposeful
circumvention.
there
are...
there
are
precedents
of
this
court
that
indicate
that
the
identification
by
a
state
of
federal
activity
or
tax-immune
income
for
taxation
by
circumvention
is
improper
and
imperils
the
supremacy
clause.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
an
old,
but
in
our
view
perfectly
appropriate,
decision,
miller
versus
milwaukee,
which
dealt
with
that
sort
of
thing;
and
moses
lake
homes,
which
in
fact...
moses
lake
homes--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--i
don't
think
it's
been
limited.
i
think
what
the
court
indicated
was
it
still
stands
for
the
important
proposition
that
you
can't
discriminate
against
the
federal
government
and
those
with
whom
it
deals.
and
in
fact,
moses
lake
homes,
it
seems
to
us,
answers
the
very
attempt
of
the
state
here
to
recast
the
absolute
immunity
that
the
court
has
never
questioned
in
terms
of
a
no
competitive
disadvantage
principle.
if
the
court
will
recall
in
moses
lake
homes,
a
case
which
also
came
from
the
state
of
washington,
the
state
of
washington
imposed
a
higher
tax
on
federal
lessees
than
state...
than
private
lessees.
and
the
court...
the
ninth
circuit
struck
that
tax
down
and
remanded
it
to
the
district
court
for
recomputation
to
impose
an
equivalent
tax
on
the
federal
lessees.
and
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
this
court
had
no
trouble
saying
that
a
discriminatory
tax
like
that
was
invalid.
without
further
discussion,
the
whole
tax
was
invalid.
so
we're
not
really...
it
seems
to
us
it
would
be
wrong
to
demean
the
absolute
immunity
of
the
united
states
from
federal
taxation
and
the
anti-discrimination
principle
which
is
part
and
parcel
of
that
by
saying
that
somehow,
as
long
as
the
federal
government
or
federal
construction
contracts
bear
the
same
cost
in
the
marketplace,
that
that's
sufficient,
the
federal
government
simply
is
protected
against
paying
any
more.
in
our
view,
the
decisions
of
this
court
convincingly
refute
that
kind
of
relegation
of
the
immunity
principle
to
what
i
might
call
a
most
favored
nation
clause
in
a
tariff
treaty.
this
is
an
essential
part
of
the
constitution.
it
protects
the
federal
government
from
impairment
of
its
functions
by
insisting
that
those
who
deal
with
the
federal
government
are
not
singled
out
for
discriminatory
tax
treatment.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
