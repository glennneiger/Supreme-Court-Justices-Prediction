finished?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
you
concede
that

in
a
sense,
the
state

washington
is
a
victim
of
its
own
legislative
move
back
in
1941,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you're
a
victim
only
in
the
sense
you
have
this
litigation
on
your
hands--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--only
in
the
sense
you
have
the
litigation
on
your
hands.
well,
if
you
treated
all
