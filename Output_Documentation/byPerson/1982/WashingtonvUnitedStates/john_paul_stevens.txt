justice
john
paul
stevens
refresh
my
recollection.
wasn't
it
also
true
in
that
case
that
the
possessory
interest
tax
was
paid
on
state-owned
property
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
different
from
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
answered
justice
o'connor
a
while
ago
that
you...
that
contractors
contracting
with
the
state
government
are
treated
just
like
private
contractors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
smith,
before
you
leave
fresno,
i
should
have
reread
the
case
before
today,
but
is
it
not
true
that
in
the
california
possessory
interest
tax,
not
only
did
the
tax
apply
to
tenants
of
all
publicly
owned
property,
but
to
any
property
the
owner
of
which
was
tax
exempt,
such
as
charities?
wasn't
there
a
broad
class
of
properties?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
make
it
quite
different
from
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
admit
that,
then
what
if
washington
were
to
amend
its
tax
to
take
the
approach
it
now
applies
just
to
the
federal
government
and
create
a
class
of
contracts
including
state
agencies
and
the
like
and
treat
them
the
way
they
now
treat
the
federal
government?
would
that
save
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
did
the
dissenting
opinion
in
fresno,
but
it
wasn't
very
persuasive.
