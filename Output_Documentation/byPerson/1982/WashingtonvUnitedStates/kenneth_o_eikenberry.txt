mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
effort
of
the
united
states,
successful
so
far,
to
prevent
the
state
of
washington
from
deriving
any
sales
tax
or
use
tax
from
the
significant
federal
construction
that's
going
on
in
our
state.
i'd
like
first
to
explain
what
the
controversy
is
about
as
a
practical
matter
and
then
proceed
on
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
how
we
believe
they
do
allow
the
application
of
this
sales
and
use
tax.
washington
imposes
a
general
retail
sales
tax
on
the
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
and
other
services
in
the
state
of
washington.
we
do
have
the
usual
complementary
use
tax
on
the
other
side
of
it.
there
is
a
single
rate
of
5.4
percent
embodied
in
a
single
statute
applicable
to
all
of
these
sales
occurring
in
the
state,
and
this
by
far
is
our
single
largest
source
of
general
revenue
in
the
state
of
washington.
we
do
not
have,
as
is
common,
an
income
tax,
because
that
is
prohibited
by
our
constitution.
under
our
system
federal
contractors
are
treated
the
same
way
as
most
other
buyers
of
tangible
personal
property.
when
they
buy
bricks
or
nails
or
cement
for
incorporation
into
a
construction
project,
they're
treated
the
same
way
that
you
or
i
would
be
treated
if
we
were
buying
the
same
things
to
improve
our
homes.
5.4
percent
would
be
added
on
to
the
cost
of
those
materials
and
we
would
pay
it
to
the
seller.
the
same
is
true
if
we
bought
an
automobile
or
food
or
cigarettes
or
whatever.
the
legal
problem
arises
because
we
treat
federal
contractors
differently
from
nonfederal
contractors
in
the
construction
projects.
ironically,
the
federal
government
is
challenging
our
system,
which
gets
more
revenue
out
of
nonfederal
construction
than
it
does
for
federal
construction,
and
this
is
true
because
for
nonfederal
construction
projects
the
5.4
percent
tax
is
added
to
the
entire
price
of
a
nonfederal
job.
that
is,
not
just
for
materials
but
also
for
labor
and
profit
and
overhead.
all
of
these
go
into
the
tax
base.
meanwhile.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
if
we're
talking
about
a
nonfederal
contractor,
your
honor,
that
sales
tax
is
added
to
the
price
that's
finally
presented.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
the
private
contractor
does
not
buy...
does
not
pay
the
materials
sales
tax
when
he
buys
his
bricks.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
the
federal
contractor
does,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
all
right.
then
i
didn't
present
it
clearly,
because
what
i
was
attempting
to
do
in
the
original
way
i
described
the
sales
tax
is
to
show
that
across
the
board
on
the
sale
of
retail
items,
whether
it
be
bricks
or
cars
or
cigarettes
or
whatever,
there
is
at
that
point--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
it
is
the
same
5.4
percent
at
the
time--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that's
true,
your
honor,
including
overhead,
profit,
materials,
and
everything
that
went
into
it.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
there's
no
question
but
what
this
statute
was
designed
to
apply
the
sales
tax
to
these
transactions,
which
were
significant
in
our
state
and
we
believe
deserve
to
help
bear
the
brunt
of
cost
of
services
delivered
by
state
government.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
i
would
resist
categorizing
it
as
a
victim,
your
honor,
because,
like
most
states,
these
taxing
schemes
evolve
over
a
period
of
time
and
as
circumstances
change
and
one
type
of
activity
increases
it
becomes
more
apparent--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--well,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that's
certainly
true,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that's
absolutely
true,
your
honor.
we
would
be
back
under
the
rules
that
were
applicable--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--with
the
dravo
contracting
case.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes.
1937
i
believe
was
the
time
that
the
court
made
that
step
and
said
that
it
was
entirely
appropriate
to
apply
such
a
tax.
if
i
may--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--in
fact,
that's
the
position
being
taken
here
by
the
government,
we
believe,
in
advancing
these
arguments,
that
is,
that
if
the
same
identical
tax
were
applied
then
to
contractors
in
the
private
sector
then
there
would
be
no
argument.
on
the
contrary,
we're
saying
that
the
fact
that
everybody
pays
in
our
state
a
retail
sales
tax,
that
the
tax
on
the
nonfederal
construction,
applied
the
way
it
does,
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
constitutionally
speaking,
and
that
the
government's
objections
are
formalistic
and
hypertechnical.
we
believe
the
principles
of
federalism
and
the
purpose
of
the
supremacy
clause
does
not
require
this
kind
of
rigidity
or
inflexibility.
further,
we
believe
the
objections
of
the
united
states
disregard
the
common
sense
that
this
court
has
embodied
in
prior
decisions
beginning
with
the
case
of
james
against
dravo
contracting
company
in
1937,
proceeding
on
up
through
the
u.s.
against
fresno
county
case
in
1977
and
as
recently
as
last
year,
the
same
principles
being
articulated
in
u.s.
against
mexico.
i'd
like
to
suggest
a
case
that
illustrates
the
hypertechnical
approach
being
relied
on
by
the
government.
as
long
ago
as
1939
in
southern
pacific
railway
against
gallagher
in
the
state
of
california,
a
taxpayer
was
arguing
that
application
of
the
use
tax
to
property
that
they
brought
into
the
state
from
out
of
state
was
unfair
and
discriminatory
as
far
as
the
interstate
commerce
clause
was
concerned
because
it
did
not
equate
with
a
state
retail
sales
tax,
which
of
course
applied
to
vendors
and
vendees
in
that
state.
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
complaint
was
the
theory
that
the
retailer
might
be
able
to
absorb
part
of
that
tax,
and
this
court
said
no,
that
that
was
hypertechnical,
the
difference
in
the
legal
incidence
in
the
way
those
taxes
were
applied
made
no
constitutional
difference
at
all.
and
as
the
court
said,
there
is
an
equal
charge
against
what
is
used,
whatever
its
source.
and
this
is
the
approach
we're
urging
on
the
court
to
take
today
with
regard
to
this
hypertechnical,
what
we
believe
formalistic
complaint.
we're
submitting
the
court
should
construe
the
supremacy
clause
so
as
to
protect
the
federal
government
against
a
state
tax
which
places
the
government
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
in
obtaining
resources
necessary
to
perform
its
functions,
but
at
the
same
time
construing
the
supremacy
clause
so
as
to
allow
the
state
the
greatest
flexibility
to
fashion
a
tax
scheme
that
will
fit
our
particular
circumstances.
we
certainly
acknowledge,
just
to
lay
the
groundwork,
that
the
state
may
not
lay
the
incidence
of
a
tax
directly
on
the
federal
government.
that
is
mccolluch
against
maryland,
starting
160
years
ago.
and
that
is
why
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
was
not
imposed
on
the
government
here
in
the
state
of
washington.
and
of
course,
just
to
make
the
step,
this
court
held
that
a
state...
it
diverted
from
that
and
said
that
the
state
may
impose
a
tax
on
people
dealing
with
the
federal
government
in
1937
in
the
james
against
dravo
case,
and
this
court
held
that
that
may
occur
even
though
the
cost
of
that
tax
is
passed
on
to
the
federal
government,
even
though
that
becomes
an
expense
of
doing
that
business.
so
that
brings
us,
i
believe,
to
the
test,
the
question
here
before
the
court
today:
what
is
the
test
that
should
be
applied
to
determine
whether
a
tax
with
those
dealing
with
the
federal
government
is
discriminatory
under
the
supremacy
clause?
now,
the
court,
as
i
say,
indicated
it
was
all
right
for
a
state
to
tax
contractors
dealing
with
the
federal
government
if
the
same
tax
is
imposed
on
all
other
contractors,
and
in
so
doing
the
court
implicitly
accepted
the
principle
that
economic
forces
will
work
the
same
in
both
the
federal
and
the
nonfederal
sectors.
and
we
suggest
that
we
can
go
from
that
case
to
say
that
they
become
economic
burden
partners
in
both
the
federal
and
the
nonfederal
sectors.
by
economic
burden
partners,
we'd
suggest
that
we
have
a
case
where
parties
to
a
transaction
which
is
subject
to
a
tax,
where
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
on
one
party
or
the
other
and
the
economic
burden
of
the
tax
will
be
determined
as
part
of
the
negotiations
in
response
to
market
forces
which
would
apply
to
those
kinds
of
transactions
at
that
time.
so
of
course
the
question
is,
does
this
economic
burden
partner
principle
carry
over
to
the
case
we're
presenting
to
the
court
today,
and
we
believe
that
it
does.
the
question
is,
does
this
principle
apply
when
the
legal
incidence
of
a
tax
is
on
a
different
partner
in
the
federal
transaction
than
it
does
on
the
partner
in
the
nonfederal
transaction.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
the
incidence
is
on
different
partners
in
the
transaction,
but
i
believe
we
can
show
that
it
is
not
a
discriminatory
tax
simply
because
that
incidence
is
placed
on
different
partners
to
the
transaction.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
each
of
those
discrimination
cases,
your
honor,
are
a
situation
where
the
taxes
were
different
from
the
taxes
being
applied
against
other
people
that
might
be
in
comparable
transactions.
in
the
moses
lake
case,
as
you
recall,
we
had
a
state
sales
tax
on
leasehold
interests
of
people
renting
federal
housing,
and
because
of
the
way
the
tax
was
applied
it
was
simply
higher
than
any
other
tax
for
similar
leaseholds.
in
the
case
of
phillips,
where
we
had
a
manufacturing
company
leasing
a
property
from
the
federal
government,
producing
ammonia,
because
of
the
way
the
tax
was
applied
again,
it
was
simply
higher
than
it
was
to
any
other
leasehold
interest,
and
it
states
so
factually,
we
believe
they're
significantly
different.
here
we
have
the
same
tax.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
there
was...
there
was
some
discussion
about
whether
people
in
the
same
identical
situation
as
federal
contractors
were
treated
the
same.
but
i
believe
that
the
bulk
of
the
concern
of
the
opinion
was
concerned
with
the
fact
that
across
the
board
the
tax
was
not
the
same.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
we
say
we
do
not
treat
them
less
fairly,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--we
say
that
they're
being
treated
equally
in
both
the
federal
sector
and
the
nonfederal
sector.
and
let
me
use
the
way
this
thing
developed
in
the
detroit
case,
u.s.
versus
city
of
detroit
in
1958,
where
you
had
a
situation
of
the
tax
being
imposed
on
the
leasehold
interest
of
the
borg-warner
corporation,
doing
private
manufacturing,
and
the
court
upheld
that
tax
because
there
was
a
comparable
tax
on
landowners
who
passed
their
cost
on
to
their
tenants.
so
there
was
incidence
falling
in
different
places.
it
was
on...
in
the
federal
situation
the
tax
was
on
the
tenant,
and
on
the
nonfederal
situation
the
tax
was
on
the
landlord.
nevertheless,
the
court
held
that
there
was
an
equalization
process
going
on
there,
that
it
was
inevitable
that
these
burdens
would
be
shared.
the
court
did
not
use
that
expression,
but
it
was
obvious
that
it
was
viewed
as
the
burden
of
the
tax
passing
from
the
private
landlord
to
his
tenant
and
the
possessory
interest
tax
passing
from
the
federal
government's
tenant
to
the
federal
government,
and
there
was
an
equalization
of
the
tax
that
fell
on
the
use
of
property
in
that
state,
and
therefore
it
was
not
regarded
as
being
discriminatory.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
the
economic
forces
of
the
marketplace--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--your
honor
is
mentioning,
of
course,
the
up-front
money
problem
that
we
have
mentioned
in
our
brief.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
and
there
is
at
least
three
different
aspects
that
need
to
be
touched
on
in
responding
to
that.
first
of
all,
the
economic
forces
of
the
marketplace
are
going
to
see
to
it
that
the
parties
in
negotiating
the
terms
of
their
contract
will
balance
out,
we
believe,
as
between
federal
and
nonfederal.
in
other
words,
in
the
federal
sector
there
are
such
things
as
advance
funding
accounts
that
can
be
used
and
have
been
used,
that
may
completely
eliminate
that
problem
for
the
private
contractor,
and
over
on
the
nonfederal
side
there
are
comparable
arrangements
that
can
be
worked
out.
in
any
event,
it's
significant,
i
think,
to
point
out
that
the
federal
government
has
not
complained
of
that
as
being
a
problem,
nor
is
there
evidence
before
the
court
or
in
the
record
on
that
matter.
if
we
can
go
ahead
and,
discussing
this
same
issue
that's
been
raised
here
by
the
court,
compare
what
occurred
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
county
of
fresno,
where
we
again
had
the
legal
incidence
falling
on
one
partner
in
the
federal
transaction
and
a
different
partner
in
the
nonfederal
transaction.
there,
of
course,
under
authority
of
state
law
a
possessory...
a
leasehold
possessory
interest
tax
was
imposed
against
tenants
of
the
federal
government.
a
comparable
tax,
a
property
tax,
was
imposed
by
the
state
on
landlords
in
the
private
sector.
and
the
court
in
writing
that
opinion
presumed
that
the
economic
burden
of
that
real
property
tax
on
the
landlord
would
be
passed
to
the
tenant.
now,
of
course
the
presumption
then
has
to
be
compared
with
the
federal
situation,
and
the
court
said
nevertheless
that
the
tax
was
reasonable,
that
it
was
fair,
that
the
same
market
forces
applied
to
both
parties
as
they
arrived
at
their
pricing
level,
and
that
the
placement
of
the
legal
incidence
in
that
case
was
irrelevant.
now,
of
course
there
is
another
matter
that
comes
out
of
that
case
that
needs
to
be
addressed,
and
that
was
the
matter,
the
reasons
indicated
by
justice
stevens
in
his
dissent
that
the
tax
did
appear
on
its
face
to
be
discriminatory
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
initially,
at
least,
in
its
pricing
scheme
was
collecting
both
the
cost...
because
they
were
basing
their
prices
on
comparable
market
value
or
prices
for
rental
units,
was
including
both
the
possessory
interest
tax
and
the...
or
rather,
including
the
value
of
property
tax
and
then
the
tenant
was
having
to
pay
the
possessory
interest
tax.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
but
nevertheless,
the
principle
is
the
same,
because
the
only
way
to
explain
the
case
and
i
believe
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
tax
did
not
discriminate
against
the
government
and
thereby
breach
the
protective
mantle
of
the
supremacy
clause
in
that
case,
because
the
government,
even
if
it
assumed
the
burden
of
the
tax
by
lowering
its
rents,
would
not
be
placed
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
vis
a
vis
other
landlords
who
had
to
pay
over
a
portion
of
their
rent
to
the
state
government.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
this
would
be
an
alternate
scheme
that
could
be
used,
your
honor,
a
gross
receipts
tax
of
sorts
applied
to--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--well,
i
believe
that
we
would
have
to
have
a
comparable
tax
on
contractors--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--oh,
yes.
let
me
agree
with
the
court.
then
the
only
distinction
i
was
drawing
is
that
in
our
situation
we
have
an
identical
tax,
although
it's
applied...
the
incidence
falls
on
a
different
party
in
the
nonfederal
transaction.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
if
i
correctly
understand
what's
being
posed
here
and
the
tax
were
identical
in
its
rate,
yes,
i
believe
we
could,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
absolutely.
that
would
be
the
final
test,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
it's
bargaining
between
the
parties,
your
honor,
and
the
forces
that
happen
to
be
in
play
in
the
marketplace
at
that
time.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
i
did.
did
i
misunderstand?
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
it's
identical
as
between
the
private
and
the
state
government
being
the
customer,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
oh.
no,
you
may
not
bargain
who
bears
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
legally
it
falls
definitely
on
the
one
party.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
it
would
fall
on
the
private
party
or
the
state.
nevertheless,
the
two
parties
to
that
transaction
may--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--the
owner
of
the
property
for
whom
the
construction
is
being
done.
nevertheless,
the
two
parties
may
recognize
that
the
market
forces
in
work
today
say
to
me
as
a
customer
that
i'm
not
willing
to
accept
the
total
price
that
results
from
what
you
said
the
materials
and
your
labor
and
your
profit
will
be,
plus
that
tax.
and
therefore
they
can
bargain
and
arrive
at
a
new
price,
so
that
the
results
will
work
out
the
same.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
sir.
if
i
may,
i
would
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes.
we
have
the
comparable
use
tax
if
sales
tax
has
not
been
paid
and
things
have
been
brought
in
from
out
of
state.
so
we
have
both
the
sales
tax
on
the
retail
sales
and
the
use
tax
for--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--yes.
your
honors,
if
we're
dealing
in
a
nonfederal
situation
the
contractor
prepares
a
bill
for
his
labor,
materials
costs,
et
cetera,
and
then
calculates
a
retail
sales
tax
and
presents
that,
collects
the
money
from
the
customer
and
remits
it
to
the
state.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
that's
true.
and
if
i
may
add
one
thing
to
that,
your
honor,
there
is
an
advantage
to
the
state
in
doing
it
that
way
because
also
we
have
the
legal
ability
if
the
tax
is
not
collected
to
hold
the
contractor
seller
liable,
or
we
could
go
after
the--
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
--because
we've
said
it's
his
duty
to
collect
it
from
the
customer.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
i
understand
the
point,
your
honor.
but
legal
incidence
we
believe
is
on
the
customer.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
is...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
quite
hear.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
absolutely,
yes,
sir.
profit,
services,
labor,
and
the
whole
cost
of
the
project.
mr.
kenneth
o.
eikenberry
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
submit
that
the
test
which
this
court
may
apply
in
this
case
is
inherent
in
the
fresno
case
and
the
detroit
case,
and
i
would
state
it
as
follows:
a
state
may
properly
tax
those
doing
business
with
the
federal
government
where
the
same
tax
is
imposed
on
comparable
nonfederal
situations
and
transactions,
where
the
same
tax
on
those
dealing
with
the
united
states
is
no
greater
than
the
tax
on
nonfederal
transactions.
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
in
fact,
the
federal
government
even
has
a
cushion,
if
you
will,
because
the
tax
in
the
federal
situation,
the
tax
base
is
lower.
this
test
provides
the
united
states
not
being
placed
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
in
carrying
out
its
functions,
and
it
provides
that
those
who
are
similarly
situated
in
other
transactions
will
be
treated
alike.
it
ensures,
we
believe
also,
that
there
will
be
a
political
check,
because
this
broad
class
has
been
created
and
the
taxes
will
therefore
not
be
raised
abusively.
and
that
would
conclude
our
argument,
your
honor.
