justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
contract...
absent
this
contract
what
price
could
you
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
suppose
that...
suppose...
suppose
the
contract
was
in
force
and
you
wanted
a
price
increase,
and
the
utility
said
sorry,
we
won't
pay
it,
and
you
say
well,
we
will
then
exercise
our
option
to
cancel
the
contract,
so
no
contract.
what
price
then
would
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
price
would
be
controlled
by
the
federal
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
the
109
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
if
the
utility
said
sorry,
we
won't
pay
the
contract
prices,
your
maximum
release
is
to
have
no
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
anybody
you
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
it
be
subject
at
all
to
the
gas
policy
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
"was
under
contract".
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
time
when
there
isn't
any
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
irrelevant.
if
a
contract
expires,
it's
irrelevant
because
it
was
covered
by
a
contract
on
the
date
of
the
act,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
federal
act
set
a
ceiling
on
the
price
of
this
gas?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
despite
any
provision
in
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional?
you
don't
claim
the
federal
act
was
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
were
some...
you
don't
think
the
federal
act
is
vulnerable
at
all
under
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
did...
did...
is
there
a
preemption
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
it
did,
it
wouldn't
reach
the
contract
clause
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
would
be
a
commerce
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the...
did
the
kansas
court
rely
on
the
federal
act
as
precluding
the
operation
of
these
clauses?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hope
you're
clearing
up
the
question,
not
the
answer.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
known
that...
would
it
be
classified
that
way
if
it
expired
by
cancellation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose...
suppose
the...
suppose
the
utility,
your
client...
is
that
your
client,
the
utility?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
suppose
the
utility
said
well,
you've
purported
to
increase
the
price.
we
just
won't
pay
it.
and
then
the
pipeline
or
the
producer
or
the
other
side
of
the
contract
said
we
cancel
the
contract
pursuant
to
its
terms.
is
that
an
expiration
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
what
would
that...
then
what
would
the
controlling
section
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
also
intrastate
gas.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
also
intrastate
gas.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
102
applied
to
new
gas.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
old
gas.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
a
contractually
allowed
increased
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
the
contract
wouldn't
allow
an
increased
price
because
the
state
law
was
to
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
102,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
complaint
is
that
it
violates
a
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
limiting
state
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
just
turns
the
contract
clause
into
a
due
process
limitation.
