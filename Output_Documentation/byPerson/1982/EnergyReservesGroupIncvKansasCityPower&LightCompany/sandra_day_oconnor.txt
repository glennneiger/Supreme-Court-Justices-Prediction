mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
prices
under
the
contract
here
had
increased
under
that
second
clause
before
the
kansas
legislature
passed
the
act
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm.
and
that
was
when?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
act
retroactively
apply,
the
kansas
act,
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
davis,
if
you
were
correct
and
your
client
were
allowed
to
terminate
its
contracts,
what
price
could
it
now
charge
under
the
natural
gas
act,
under
the
ngpa?
what
section
would
control
the
price,
if
you
were
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
section
109,
wouldn't
it?
well,
yes.
that's
the
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kelsey,
what
justification
is
there
for
the
kansas
statute
to
allow
increases
under
these
indefinite
escalator
clauses
for
old
intrastate
gas
in
contracts
executed
after
april
20,
1977
but
not
for
contracts
executed
before
that
date?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
based
on
the
president's
speech.
