mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
one
issue
necessarily
before
the
court
in
this
case
today
is
the
constitutionality
of
state
natural
gas
price
controls.
the
kansas
natural
gas
price
protection
act
amounts
to
the
intrastate
corollary
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
which
was
signed
by
the
president
four
years
ago
today.
before
i
begin
my
argument,
however,
i
should
like
to
clear
up
a
question
that
justice
white
put
to
mr.
davis.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
thank
you
for
correcting
me,
your
honor.
i'll
try
to
give
you
a
clear
answer.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
i
think
your
honor
inquired
as
to
what
this
gas
could
receive
if
it
were
to
be
sold
in
the
interstate
market
upon
the
expiration
of
this
contract.
this
gas
is
in
fact
controlled
by
section
105(b)(1)
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
so
long
as
this
contract
remains
in
effect.
when
the
contract
expires
by
its
own
terms,
it
would
then
be
what
is
known
under
the
ngpa
as
a
rollover
contract
under
section
106
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
that
section
provides--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
it
would
then
be
known
as
a
successor
contract
and
would
be
treated
under--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--yes.
the
kansas
power
and
light
company.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
no,
it
isn't.
then
any
new
contract
entered
into
would
be
what
is
called
a
successor
contract
which
is
anything
but
a
rollover
contract.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
the
controlling
section
would
remain
105,
and
the
price
that
the
producer
could
obtain
under
the
new
successor
contract
would
be
two
different
answers:
one,
assuming
the
price
protection
act
remains
in
effect,
it
would
get
the
maximum
the
price
protection
act
allowed.
if
the
price
protection
act
is
not
in
effect,
the
producer
could
then
receive
for
its
gas
whatever
that
former
contract
would
have
permitted,
whatever
its
terms
would
have
called
for
subject
to
the
federal
maximum.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
if,
as
i
started
out
by
saying,
the
contract
expired
by
its
own
terms
and
it
were
a
rollover
contract,
the
maximum
price
the
producer
could
then
receive
under
the
terms
of
section
106
would
be
the
price
being
paid
during
the
month
in
which
that
contract
terminated
by
its
own
terms.
that
would
be
the
ceiling.
your
honors,
energy
reserves
must
overcome
the
presumption
of
constitutional
validity
to
which
the
price
protection
act
is
entitled.
the
kansas
power
and
light
company
will
address
three
issues
raised
by
appellants
in
this
appeal.
first,
the
contracts
between
the
kansas
power
and
light
company
and
the
appellant
have
not
been
substantially
impaired.
energy
reserves
is
receiving
exactly
and
precisely
what
it
contracted
for.
it
has
no
right
to
rely
on
anything
other
than
the
price
federal
and
state
law
allows.
therefore,
the
constitutional
inquiry
may
be
ended
at
this
stage.
second,
the
price
protection
act
serves
a
legitimate
public
purpose,
and
that
is
the
moderation
of
sudden
increases
in
price
for
a
fuel
vital
to
kansas
agricultural
economy
and
the
welfare
of
its
citizens.
energy
reserves
has
admitted
that
kansas
may
constitutionally
set
maximum
prices
to
protect
its
consumers.
the
thrust
of
energy
reserves'
argument
seems
to
be
its
specious
claim
that
the
price
protection
act
is
somehow
special
legislation
that
benefits
the
kansas
power
and
light
company
and
other
gas
distributors.
the
only
beneficiaries
of
this
price
protection
act
are
the
approximately
two
million
consumers
of
intrastate
gas
in
kansas
who
pay,
penny
for
penny,
all
costs
of
the
gas
they
consume.
as
to
the
cost
of
gas
paid
to
producers,
utilities
are
nothing
more
than
a
conduit
of
dollars
from
the
consumer
to
the
producer.
in
fact,
for
the
12
months
ended
september
30,
1982,
91
percent
of
kansas
power
and
light
company's
gas
department
revenues
amounted
solely
to
gas
costs
paid
to
consumers,
to
purchasers.
third,
the
legitimate
public
purpose
of
the
price
protection
act
has
been
achieved
on
reasonable
conditions
which
have
been
appropriately
tailored
to
the
goal
with
great
deference
to
producers.
the
price
protection
act
in
fact
strikes
at
100
percent
of
the
evil
perceived
by
the
legislature
by
imposing
prices
which
have
been
deemed
reasonable
by
the
congress.
energy
reserves'
contracts
have
not
been
substantially
impaired
for
two
specific
reasons.
it
is
receiving
exactly
what
it
contracted
for,
no
more
and
no
less;
and
that
is
a
price
controlled
by
both
state
and
federal
regulation.
sections
18
and
20
of
these
gas
supply
contracts,
respectively,
provide
that
the
contracts
are
expressly
subject
to
and
incorporate
all
future
state
and
federal
laws.
thus--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--yes.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
your
honor,
while
i
think
that
this
provision
is
uncommon
in
gas
supply
contracts,
in
answer
to
your
question
i
think
that
the
allied
structural
steel
would
have
not
had
an
argument
that
it
contracts
had
been
substantially
impaired.
it
might
well
have
had
other
arguments,
but
it
could
not
have
argued
that
having
incorporated
the
state
law
into
its
contracts
that
somehow
later
then
a
future
state
law
could
impair
the
terms
of
that
contract
which
embodied
the
law.
the
price
protection
act
and
the--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
yes,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
state
of
kansas,
either
through
the
legislature
or
perhaps
through
the
state
corporation
commission,
could
have
purported
to
have
declared
these
clauses
null
and
void.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
for
the
state
corp--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--for
the
state
corporation
commission--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--dealing
with
the
terms
of
the
gas
contract
and
declaring
them
null
and
void?
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
no,
there
isn't,
your
honor,
and
in
fact,
the
state
corporation
commission
when
it
adopted
the
order
which
requires
the
immediate
and
automatic
pass-through
of
all
natural
gas
costs
paid
to
consumers,
in
docket
number
106-850
said
in
april
of
1977:
"since
energy
costs
are
largely
outside
the
control
of
the
utility,
they
ultimately
must
be
passed
through
to
the
consumer,
and
an
appropriately
designed
clause
is
the
most
efficient
method
to
accomplish
this
pass-through.
"
so
the
commission
has
not
taken
it
upon
itself
to...
to
renegotiate
the
terms
of
the
contracts
between
the
parties.
these
very
contracts
were
the
subject
of
an
extensive
hearing
in
1975
before
the
state
corporation
commission,
and
the
escalator
clauses
were
inquired
into
extensively
in
that
hearing.
and
the
state
corporation
commission
authorized
the
kansas
power
and
light
company
to
commence
purchases
of
gas
under
those
contracts,
including
those
terms.
so
today
the
law
of
the
state
of
kansas
is
those
terms
are
approved.
your
honors,
it
is
our
position
that
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
the
price
protection
act
are
part
of
the
terms
of
these
contracts.
these
contracts
were
executed
in
an
atmosphere
of
pervasive
regulation
of
natural
gas
by
federal
and
state
governments.
kansas
has
regulated
all
aspects
of
natural
gas
for
more
than
75
years.
the
parties
foresaw
state
and
federal
law
and
regulations
and
incorporated
them
into
their
contracts.
when
a
contract
incorporates
state
law,
that
law
by
definition
is
a
part
of
that
contract,
and
the
law
cannot
impair
itself.
the
second
specific
reason
there's
been
no
substantial
impairment
of
these
contracts
is
that
energy
reserves
has
no
right
to
rely
on
anything
more
than
section
105
of
the
ngpa,
and
that
is
a
maximum
price
subject
to
kansas'
right
to
limit
the
operation
of
the
contractual
escalator
clauses
below
that
maximum
price.
the
price
protection
act
merely
represents
kansas'
exercise
of
that
specific
right.
energy
reserves
purports
to
rely
on
the
ngpa
for
its
claim
to
higher
prices,
and
yet
it
claims
the
price
protection
act
impaired
its
contracts.
we
agree
that
the
contracts
are
subject
to
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
we
do
not
agree,
however,
that
energy
reserves
is
subject
only
to
the
price
limitations
of
the
ngpa
it
prefers
to
the
exclusion
of
other,
more
stringent
limitations
in
that
act
it
does
not
prefer.
prior
to
the
ngpa
there
were
no
limitations
on
the
operation
of
these
indefinite
price
escalator
clauses
in
the
contracts.
the
sky
was
the
limit.
the
ngpa
placed
two
specific,
separate
limitations
on
the
operation
of
these
clauses.
first,
section
105
provides
that
in
no
event
may
escalator
clauses
operate
to
produce
a
price
in
excess
of
the
ngpa
section
102
price.
but
for
this
limit,
energy
reserves
could
today
obtain
a
much
higher
price
for
its
gas
than
that
section
102
price.
the
second
limitation
intended
by
congress
in
section
105
is
the
specific
right
of
kansas
to
prescribe
more
stringent
limitations
on
the
operation
of
these
escalator
clauses.
in
response,
kansas,
and
oklahoma
for
that
matter,
have
prescribed
modestly
more
stringent
limitations
on
the
operation
of
these
clauses.
energy
reserves
has,
therefore,
no
right
to
cheerfully
rely
on
and
in
fact
unconditionally
demand
one
price
limitation
set
by
congress
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other.
that
maximum
price
set
by
congress
was
said
to
be
subject
to
kansas'
further
limitation
on
those
escalator
clauses.
energy
reserves'
reliance,
therefore,
on
these
contracts
in
the
ngpa
may
not
exceed
the
price
permitted
by
both
conditions.
just...
they
may
not,
as
they
would
have
it,
just
rely
on
one
condition
which
would
permit
it
the
higher
incentive
price
for
its
old
non-incentive
gas.
energy
reserves
has
no
new
wells
as
defined
in
the
ngpa
which
provides
that
higher
price
for
new
wells.
this
is
all
old
gas
wells
drilled
in
the
'50s
and
'60s
primarily.
apparently--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
it
is
indeed
intrastate
gas
subject
to
the
terms
of
section
105
which
say
the
price
of
that
gas
is
whatever
the
price
is
under
the
terms
of
your
contract,
but
in
nor
than
in
excess
of
section
102
unless
the
states
further
limit
the
operation
of
those
escalator
clauses.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
even
if--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--even
if
congress
had
not
passed
the
statute?
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
if
the
kansas
legislature
had
not
passed
the
statute,
then
in
1981
in
november
energy
reserves'
contract
under
its
price
redetermination
escalator
clause
that
mr.
davis
referred
to,
its
price
would
have
been
redetermined
to
a
maximum
price
of
that
section
102
price
provided
energy
reserves
could
have
produced
three
contracts
that...
in
the
area
that
were
comparable
and
met
the
terms
of
the
contracts
that
were
calling
for
that
price,
that
were
receiving
prices.
so,
in
fact,
in
november
of
1981
there
was
a
price
redetermination
under
these
contracts.
there
has
been
a
price
increase
since--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--it
had
no
effect
on
what
they
were
entitled
to
receive
for
the
reason
that
i
mentioned.
it
is
only
entitled
to
receive
what
the
state
law
allows
it.
in
specific
response
to
your
honor's
question,
it
is
receiving
less
in
all
likelihood
than
it
would
have
been
receiving
had
the
price
protection
act
not
been
passed.
in
all
likelihood
it
would
today
be
receiving
the
ngpa
section
102
price
for
november
of
1981
because
these
redeterminations
occur
every
two
years.
but
instead,
in
1981
in
november,
of
redetermining
to
that
higher
102
price,
the
parties
met,
and
as
the
price
protection
act
permits,
redetermined
to
that
ngpa
section
109
price.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
102
does
apply
to
new
gas,
your
honor,
under
the
ngpa.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
it
is
old
gas,
that
is
correct.
and
therein
lies
the
sense
of
the
structure
of
section
105(b)(1)
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
in
the
intrastate
market
there
were
various
prices
being
paid
in
the
gas-producing
states,
none
of
them
regulated
by
the
states.
there
were
high
prices
being
paid
in
texas.
we
have
contracts
as
low
as
25
cents
per
mca.
congress
simply
said
the
terms
of
those
contracts
are
the
price...
is
the
price
that
you
should
be
paid.
there
were
some
escalator
clauses
in
those
contracts,
and
so
congress
said
but
in
no
event
may
those
escalator
clauses
carry
you
above
section
102;
the
new
gas
price
is
an
absolute
maximum.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
on
the--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
kansas
supreme
court
addressed
itself
to
the
appropriateness
of
the
terms
and
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
directed
to
a
public
purpose
and
the
like.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
your
honor,
under
the
case
of
united
states
mortgage
v.
matthews
it's
our
understanding
that
this
court
is
the
court
the
determines
the
requirements
for
applying
the
constitutional
test
under
the
contract
clause.
and
as
allied
structural
steel
indicated,
if
there
is
no
substantial
impairment,
the
inquiry
may
be
ended.
in
summary,
energy
reserves
is
receiving
everything
it
contracted
for
at
a
price
permitted
by
state
and
federal
law,
and
having
received
its
legitimate
contractual
expectations,
the
contract
inquiry...
the
contract
clause
inquiry
may
be
ended.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
your
honor,
the
right
to
terminate
is
specifically
conditioned
in
the
contract
on
an
increased
price.
absent
an
increased
price,
there
is
no
right
to
terminate.
it's
as
clear
and
simple
as
that.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
yes.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
exactly,
your
honor.
as
well
as
the
federal
law
above
102.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
kansas'
right
to
set
natural
gas
prices
is
without
question.
natural
gas
is
a
vital
fuel
to
kansas.
seventy-five
percent
of
the
homes
are
heated
with
gas.
it
is
the
single
most
important
fuel
for
irrigation
pumping
and
fertilizer
production.
energy
reserves
admits
that
kansas
may
set
maximum
prices
for
all
natural
gas
to
protect
its
customers,
its
consumers.
this
inquiry...
this
admission
should
end
the
constitutional
inquiry
of
public
purpose,
because
the
price
protection
act
was
intended
to
and
it
has
the
effect
of
regulating
the
price
to
consumers
of
natural
gas
produced
and
consumed
in
kansas.
energy
reserves
purports
to
make,
however,
an
argument
that
the
price
protection
act
somehow
benefits
the
kansas
power
and
light
company.
the
state
legislature's
conclusions
and
orders
of
the
state
corporation
commission,
as
i
have
indicated,
completely
belie
that
conclusion.
as
the
legislature
knew
and
concluded
when
it
enacted
this
law,
utilities
cannot
benefit
economically
by
an
increased
or
decreased
cost
of
gas.
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
the
state
corporation
commission
to
the
legislation.
and
as
i've
indicated,
we
are
serving...
we
are
buying
gas
under
these
contracts
pursuant
to
the
commission's
approval
of
these
pricing
clauses.
we
are
passing
through
in
1981
$137
million
of
purchased
gas
cost
to
producers
without
adding
one
shred
of
interest
on
the
utility's
part.
ninety-one
percent
of
our
revenues
from
gas
operations
are
merely
purchased
gas
costs.
the
legislature,
the
trial
court,
and
the
kansas
supreme
court
all
concluded
that
but
for
the
price
protection
act,
kansas
consumers
would
pay
the
higher
new
gas
costs
for
the
old
gas
they
were
using.
the
legislature
further
concluded
that
absent
the
price
protection
act,
the
burden
of
increased
costs
will
be
passed
on
to
consumers,
and
that
savings
to
those
consumers
is
ample
reason
to
support
the
act.
the
presence
of
the
state
corporation
commission,
the
kansas
legal
services
representing
persons
of
low
income
in
kansas
in
amici
briefs
to
the
court
confirmed
that
the
$128
million
in
gas
cost
reductions
wrought
by
this
law
will
be
received
only
by
the
two
million
persons
of
the...
2,400,000
people
in
the
state.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
two
specific
answers,
your
honor.
first,
the
legislature
perceived
that
for
those
persons
who
had
intrastate
gas
to
sell
and
who
entered
into
them
after
that
date,
april
20,
1977,
when
the
president
announced
the
national
energy
plan,
the
legislature
perceived
that
those
persons
might
have
some
greater
right
to
rely
on
a
higher
price
for
their
gas.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
yes.
on
the
announcement
of
that
national
energy
plan.
secondly,
if
the
act
covered
contracts
executed
after
that
date
and
into
the
future,
producers
of
intrastate
gas
in
kansas
who
had
gas
to
sell
could
conceivably
receive
a
higher
price
in
the
interstate
market
for
that
gas,
and
it
would
tend
to
diminish
the
availability
of
gas
in
kansas.
your
honors,
energy
reserves
has
complained
that
the
terms
and
conditions
of
this
statute
are
unreasonably
narrow.
kansas'
goal
of
moderating
gas
price
increases
has
been
achieved
on
very
reasonable
conditions,
carefully
tailored
to
the
goal,
with
extraordinary
deference
to
these
very
producers.
of
all
the
gas
being
consumed
in
kansas,
only
intrastate
gas
subject
to
escalator
clauses
had
the
potential
for
sudden
increases
which
concerned
the
legislature.
the
price
protection
act
reaches
100
percent
of
that
gas.
yet,
energy
reserves
complains
that
the
price
protection
act
reaches
an
insufficient
volume
of
gas;
mr.
davis
says
10
percent
of
the
gas,
intrastate
gas
consumed
in
kansas.
the
facts
are
that
75
percent
of
all
the
gas
consumed
in
kansas
is
interstate
in
origin
and
beyond
the
reach
of
the
legislature.
moreover,
all
that
interstate
gas
is
priced,
as
a
result
of
the
ngpa,
at
or
lower
than,
much
lower
than
in
many
instances,
the
maximum
price
set
by
kansas
for
intrastate
gas.
sixty
percent
of
the
gas
consumed
in
kansas
which
is
produced
in
kansas
is
not
subject
to
these
escalator
clauses.
mr.
davis
indicated
that
fixed
price
escalator
clauses
could
take
the
price
over
102,
and
therefore
the
statute
was
narrow.
the
only
contracts
before
the
legislature
when
it
considered
this
legislation
were
contracts
with
fixed
price
escalator
clauses
of
one
or
two
cents
a
year,
one
percent
a
year.
obviously,
when
we're
talking
about
kinds
of
increases
permitted
here,
they
could
never
reach
the
section
102
price.
moreover,
the
natural
gas
policy
act
itself
in
section
105
has
the
effect
of
limiting
the
price
for
that
intrastate
gas
not
subject
to
escalator
clauses
in
effect
freezing
the
price
to
what
was
being
received
in
real
terms
on
the
day
the
act
became
a
law.
so
it's
only
40
percent
of
the
gas
consumed
in
kansas
that's
produced
in
kansas
which
was
subject
to
escalator
clauses
where
the
legislature
perceived
the
evil
of
sudden
increases
in
price.
therefore,
the
kansas
legislature
regulated
that,
and
it
regulated
100
percent
of
that
evil.
and
it
did
so
on
very
reasonable
terms,
adopting
the
pricing
scheme
of
the
ngpa.
it
did
so
by
saying
for
old
non-incentive
gas
such
as
the
gas
under
these
contracts,
we
will
allow
the
maximum
price
if
your
contracts
otherwise
call
for
it...
the
ngpa
109
price,
which
happens
to
be
the
very
same
price
as
the
maximum
price
for
old
interstate
gas
as
see
in
section
104.
it
did
so
by
saying
but
for
your
new
gas,
any
wells
the
surface
drilling
of
which
was
commenced
on
and
after
february
19,
1977,
your
contract
clauses
may
escalate
the
price
for
that
new
gas
on
up
to
that
ngpa
section
102
ceiling
in
order
to
encourage
exploration.
no
change.
it
further
said
and
moreover,
for
low
production
or
stripper
well
gas,
as
defined
in
the
ngpa
in
section
103,
the
price
protection
act
will
allow
kansas
intrastate
producers
that
very
same
maximum
gas
if
your
contract
calls
for
it.
as
energy
reserves
concedes,
kansas
has
the
constitutional
authority
to
set
maximum
prices.
therefore,
we
submit,
the
price
protection
act's
much
less
stringent
limitations
on
prices
are
constitutional.
the
legislature
was
merely
deferring
to
the
producers'
interest
in
achieving
its
goal.
energy
reserves
has
in
fact
described
the
economic
policy
of
the
ngpa
as
reasonable,
but
when
that
policy
is
applied
by
the
kansas
legislature
to
its
contracts,
it
complains
that
the
scheme
is
unconstitutionally
narrow
and
constitutes
special
legislation.
the
kansas
legislature
limited
sudden
price
increases--
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
--and
i'm...
and
i'm
addressing
my
comments,
your
honor,
to
if
there
is
in
fact
a
substantial
impairment,
which
we
think
there
is
not,
that
the
goal
was
a
clearly
legitimate
one,
as
the
ngpa's
very
goal
was
of
limiting
sudden
price
increases
for
old
gas,
because
it
froze
the
price
of
old
interstate
gas.
mr.
basil
w.
kelsey
it
meets
the...
i'm
speaking
to
the
reasonableness
with
which
the
state
legislature
sought
to
achieve
that
proper
public
purpose.
it
tailored
a
pricing
system.
it
reached
all
the
gas
it
could
reach.
it's
of
no
benefit,
none
whatsoever,
to
the
kansas
power
and
light
company.
your
honors,
if
the
price...
if
the
contract
clause
has
any
flexibility
when
vital
interests
are
served,
as
energy
reserves
concedes
in
its
reply
brief
that
it
must,
a
major
gas-producing
state
such
as
kansas
may
impose
modest
and
temporary
restrictions
on
sudden
increases
in
price
for
natural
resource
fuel
it
has
regulated
for
75
years.
natural
gas
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
health
and
welfare
of
kansas
people,
as
well
as
to
the
principal
industry
of
the
state,
and
that's
agriculture.
this
position
is
particularly
true
when
the
suppliers
of
that
essential
commodity
specifically
made
those
state
restrictions
a
part
of
the
contract
price
terms
and
when
the
pricing
system
embodied
in
those
restrictions
is
one
that
congress
has
found
as
reasonable.
thank
you.
