justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
clear
that
section
109
would
not
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
section
105
price
applies
to
gas
that's
under
contract,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
your
position
that
the
gas
would
not
be
under
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
it's
not
under
contract
and
if
105
doesn't
apply,
clearly
102
would
not
apply,
so
wouldn't
109
apply,
and
if
so,
wouldn't
you
get
an
even
lower
price?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
your
position,
as
i
understand,
in
this
court
is
that
the
contract
doesn't
cover
this
case.
or
have
i
got
it
backwards?
you're
arguing
that
the
gas...
that
the
contract
does
apply,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
the
maximum
relief
you
could
get
is
be
free
of
the
contract.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
your
point
about
kind
of
chopping
up
the
market
and
it's
just
a
small
part
of
the
market,
doesn't
the
federal
scheme
work
in
somewhat
the
same
way
by
differentiating
between
new
gas
and
old
gas
and
putting
a
lower
price
on
the
old
gas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
their
argument
that
they've
lost
their
right
to
terminate?
