justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question
in
that
connection?
the
kansas
commission
approved
the
escalation
clause
initially,
did
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
under
your
assumption
of
what
it
could
be
done,
could
the
commission
now
independently
of
the
federal
act
change
its
position
with
respect
to
the
escalation
clause
and
hold
it
null
and
void,
of
no
effect?
you
say
that
the
parties
have
what
they
contracted
for
because
the
state
reserved
the
right
to
regulate
rates,
but
having
approved
this
clause
could
the
state
of
kansas
independently
of
the
federal
act
have
revoked
the
escalation
right?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
authority
in
kansas
on
that
point?
can
the
supreme
court--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.

justice
