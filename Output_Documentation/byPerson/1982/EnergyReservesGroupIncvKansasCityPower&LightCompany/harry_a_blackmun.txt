justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
it
doesn't
lend
itself
very
well
to
a
description
from
the
bench.
i
think
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
the
case
concerns
intrastate
gas
contracts
between
the
respective
predecessors
of
the
appellant
producer
and
the
appellee
public
utility.
that
these
contracts
contained
an
escalator
clause
and
a
price
redetermination
clause,
and
that
the
federal
natural
gas
policy
act
was
in
--
enacted
in
1978
and
replaced
earlier
federal
price
controls
for
interstate
gas
as
well
as
extending
federal
price
regulation
to
the
intrastate
gas
market.
and
that
a
kansas
act
was
enacted
in
may
1979
and
imposed
price
controls
on
the
intrastate
market
with
respect
to
contracts
executed
before
april
20,
1977.
and
that
the
parties
are
in
dispute
as
to
whether
the
new
federal
act
triggered
the
escalator
clauses
and
enabled
the
producers
when
the
utility
refused
to
go
along
with
a
higher
rate
to
terminate
the
contracts.
in
this
litigation,
a
kansas
trial
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
the
utility
holding
that
the
federal
act's
imposition
of
price
ceilings
on
intrastate
gas
did
not
trigger
the
governmental
price
escalator
clauses.
and
that
the
kansas
act
did
not
violate
the
contract
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
that
reading
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
in
turn
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
which
joins
the
court's
opinion
and
except
as
to
part
ii-c
and
he
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
justice
rehnquist.
