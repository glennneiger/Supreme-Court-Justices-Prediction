mr.
gary
w.
davis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
the
court
please:
the
central
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
kansas
statute
known
by
its
framers
as
the
kansas
natural
gas
price
protection
act,
is
in
violation
of
the
contract
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
there
is
no
argument
in
this
case
that
this
particular
kansas
statute
does
impair
two
natural
gas
purchase
and
sales
contracts
between
energy
reserves
and
kansas
power
and
light
company.
there
is
also
no
question
that
this
impairment
occurs
from
five
to
six
years,
and
not
only
does
it
incur...
not
only
does
it
prevent
energy
reserves
from
receiving
a
substantial
portion
of
the
consideration
that
they
would
have
received,
it
also
prevents
it
from
receiving
its
contracted
right
of
termination
if
it
could
not
receive
the
money
that
it
was
supposed
to
receive
under
the
contract.
kansas
power
and
light
company's
answer
to
this
impairment
is
that
it
violates...
that
it
is
within
the
reserve
police
power
of
the
state
of
kansas.
underk
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
home
building
and
loan
association
v.
blaisdell,
united
states
trust
v.
the
state
of
new
jersey,
allied
structural
steel
v.
spannaus,
this
court
set
forth
certain
tests
of
reasonableness,
and
also
that
the
statute
must
be
of
a
character
justifying
the
use
of
the
police
power.
the
points
that
i
want
to
make
are
four,
and
these
are
that
in
the
first
place,
these
contracts
would
not
have
been
entered
into
without
these
pricing
provisions
that
have
been
impaired.
secondarily,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
impairment
to
erg,
energy
reserves,
is
severe.
thirdly,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
this
statute
has
an
extremely
narrow
focus,
is
very
limited
in
its
application.
and
the
fourth
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
this
statute
serves
no
broad
societal
benefit,
and
in
fact,
does
not
solve
any
emergency
or
any
supposed
emergency
that
it
is
supposed
to
solve.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
in
september
of
1975,
after
months
of
negotiations,
the
parties
finally
agreed
to
the
terms
of
these
two
contracts
that
are
involved.
these
are
what
you
call
long
term
natural
gas
contracts.
one
is
for
the
life
of
the
gas
field
and
the
other
is
for
the
life
of
a
gas
processing
plant.
they
have
a
duration
of
20
to
30
years.
the
two
pricing
provisions
that
are
involved,
the
first
one
is
one
that
says
that
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
price
prescribed
for
the
gas
involved
that
is
higher
than
the
price
that
is
being
paid
under
this
contract
by
any
governmental
authority,
then
that
new
price
as
prescribed
by
government
would
be
the
new
price
under
the
contract.
the
second
pricing
provision
that's
involved
here
is
what
is
known
as
a
pricing
redetermination
provision.
it's
in
the...
and
what
this
does,
it's
every
two
years,
energy
reserves
is
entitled
to
come
to
kp&l
and
say
that
we
want
our
price
redetermined.
we
want
it
redetermined
on
the
basis
of
what
is
being
paid
for
other
gas
in
the
state
of
kansas
under
like
contracts.
it's
a
pricing
provision
that
is
designed
to,
during
the
long
term
of
these
contracts,
to
assure
energy
reserves
that
it
is
always
receiving
a
price
that
is
akin
to
the
market
price.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
yes,
justice
o'connor
it
did.
the
price
increased
at
the
first
opportunity
in
1977,
and
it
increased
from
$1.52
a
million
btu
to
$1.77
a
million
btu.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
in
1977.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
it
definitely
does
retroactively
apply,
and
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
so
held.
the
other
provision
in
the
contract
that
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
is
what's
known
as
the
intent
provision;
and
this
intent
provision
specifically
provides
that
the
point
of
these
two
price
escalation
provisions
was
to
provide
erg
during
the
term
of
the
contract
the
anticipated
increase
in
the
natural
gas
price.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
these
price
escalation
provisions
are
not
automatically
imposed
upon
kp&l.
when
a
price
escalation
occurs
under
one
of
these
pricing
provisions,
then
kp&l
is
obligated
to
go
to
the
kansas
corporation
commission
and
seek
its
approval
to
pass
through
all
or
a
part
of
any
price
increase
under
either
one
of
these
provisions.
and
this
kp&l
did
when
the
first
price
increase
came
around.
kp&l
then
has
the
obligation
if
it
can't
get
it
passed
through,
then
kp&l
can
either
say
we're
going
to
buy
this
gas
and
take
it
out
of
our
profits,
or
they
can
tell
energy
reserves
we
couldn't
get
approval
to
pass
it
through;
therefore,
we're
not
going
to
pay
the
increased
price.
and
the
energy
reserves
is
then
given
an
option
under
the
contracts
to
terminate
if
it
does
not
receive
this
increased
price.
what
happened
was
right
after
the
1977
or
within
a
year
after
the
1977
redetermination
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978
was
passed.
this
act
authorized
and
prescribed
a
higher
price
for
intrastate
gas,
which
is
what's
involved
here,
than
the
price
that
was
then
being
paid
under
the
contract.
it
was
that
time
on
december
1,
1978
that
energy
reserves
requested
an
increased
price.
as
i
say,
the
kp&l
then
applied
twice,
once
in
december
of
'78
and
once
in
february
seeking
a
pass-through.
nothing
happened.
things
were
going
on
in
the
legislature
about
what
to
do
about
this.
and
on
may
29,
1979,
approximately
six
months
after
this
first
price
increase
would
have
been
due,
this
particular
act
was
passed.
and
what
this
particular
statute
does,
it
prevents
either
one
of
these
clauses
from
ever
coming
into
operation;
and
it
also
prevents
energy
reserves
from
exercising
the
contract
right
of
determination
if
it
doesn't
receive
one
of
these
price
increases.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
there
would
be
two
possibilities.
one
would
be
under
this
government
escalation
price
which
would
be
the
section
105
price
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act,
which
is...
congress
when
they
passed
the
natural
gas
policy
act
created
a
special
category
for
intrastate
gas
that
was
under
contract
at
the
time.
the
other
price
provision
that
would
of
course
control
would
be
this
price
redetermination
provision
which
is
a
market
price
redetermination.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
your
honor,
under
the
kansas
act
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
they
say
that
makes
the
statute
reasonable
is
that
in
lieu
of
getting
the
105
price
or
the
price
that
we're
entitled
to
under
the
contract,
a
market
price,
that
we
get
the
109
price.
this
section
109
price
of
course
is
a
special
category
of
pricing
that
was
set
forth
by
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
it
is
a
substantially
different
price
than
the
section
105
price
which
is
prescribed
for
natural
gas,
and
it's
a
different
price
than
we
would
receive
under
competitive
conditions.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
it
definitely
is.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
you
mean,
your
honor,
if
we
didn't
have
a
contract?
mr.
gary
w.
davis
the
price
would
be
the
same.
it
would
be--
mr.
gary
w.
davis
--which
would
be
the
section
105
price.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
not
the
109
price.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
because
the
market
price
was
precisely
the
same
price
as
the
105
price.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
your
honor,
but
these
contracts
were
under
contract--
mr.
gary
w.
davis
--we're
arguing
that
certainly
the
contracts
do
apply
and
that
we're
entitled
to
the
relief
that
was
afforded
to
us
under
the
contracts.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
then
we
could
go
out
and
sell
our
gas
in
the
intra--
mr.
gary
w.
davis
--to
anybody
we
wanted
to.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
no,
your
honor.
it
would
only
be
subject
to
the
ceiling
price
as
set
forth
for
section
105
gas.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
section
105
applies
to
gas
that
was
under
contract
at
the
time
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
this
gas
was
under
contract.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
right.
until
kp&l
refused
to
pay
the
price
increases.
i
want
to
point
out,
your
honor,
that
the
section
109
price
is
a
vastly
different
price
than
this
section
105
price
of
the
market
price
that
would
be
obtained.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
kp&l
at
length...
testified
at
length
concerning
these
contracts
in
1975
before
the
kansas
corporation
commission,
and
one
of
the
things
that
they
said
was
that
energy
reserves
had
a
right
at
that
time
to
alternatively
not
sell
us
gas
for
$1.53
but
sell
it
to
the
city
of
wichita
for
$2.04.
the
price
that
would
become
effective
on
december
1--
mr.
gary
w.
davis
--right,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
the
court
please:
on
this
impairment
question
i
want
to
just
clarify
one
point,
and
that
is
that
under
section
105,
which
is
the
section
that
applies
to
intrastate
gas
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act,
what
that
provides
is
in
effect
that
you
get
the
section
102
price,
which
is
a
price
substantially
higher
than
the
109
price;
and
it
also
says
that
the
effective
thing
is
having
a
contract
in
existence
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
which
was
december
1,
1978,
and
then
it
also
applies
to
any
successor
contract.
and
under
section
101--
mr.
gary
w.
davis
--your
honor,
i'm
sure
that
there--
mr.
gary
w.
davis
--a...
a
success...
right,
your
honor.
a
successor
contract
is
a
contract
that
would
come
on
after
this
contract--
mr.
gary
w.
davis
--was
terminated,
and
it
would
not
need
to
be
between
the
same
parties,
for
example.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
i
just...
and
also
on
this
impairment
question
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
section
109
price
is
vastly
different
from
the
section
102
price.
it's
about
a
dollar
a
million
btu
right
now.
in
1978,
however,
it
was
approximately
30
cents
a
million
btu,
and
it
has
gone
up
with
inflation.
on
the
question
of
inducement,
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
and
officer
of
kansas
power
and
light
company
testified
at
length
in
1975
that
these
contracts
would
not
have
been
entered
into
except
for
these
escalation
provisions.
he
also
testified
that
the
price
of
gas
was
going
to
increase
everywhere,
and
he
also
testified
concerning
the
fairness
of
these
contracts,
and
that
he
pointed
out
that
energy
reserves
had
an
option
to
sell
its
gas
at
that
time
rather
than
$1.53
at
$2.04.
the
$2.04
price
is
substantially
the
same
price
that
existed
under
the
natural
gas
policy
act
in
1978,
december
1,
1978.
in
other
words,
the
price
that
would
be
afforded
to
erg
under
its
contract
with
this
first
price
increase
that's
prevented
is
substantially
the
same
price
that
kp&l
testified
erg
could
have
sold
its
gas
for
three
years
earlier.
this
act
is
also
bad
and
improper
from
the
standpoint
that
it
is
extremely
narrow
in
its
focus.
it
covers
only
six
per...
something
less
than
six
percent
of
all
the
gas
produced
in
kansas.
it
covers
something
less
than
10
percent
of
the
gas
consumed
in
kansas.
it
applies
only
to
contracts
that
have
these
type
of
price
escalation
provisions
which
you
would
find
in
a
long-term
contract.
in
other
words,
their
price
where
there
are
indefinite
price
escalator
clauses
as
opposed
to
fixed
price
escalator
clauses.
a
fixed
price
escalator
clause
could
in
fact
result
in
a
much
higher
price,
and
that
is
certainly
not
equitable.
and,
again,
it
applies
only
to
contracts
that
were
executed
before
april
20th,
1977.
it
applies
only
to
contracts
that
are
of
long
term.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
there
can
be
no
reasonable
justification,
justice
rehnquist,
for
just
picking
out
a
few
contracts
having
a
few
types
of
contract
clauses.
there's
no
reasonable
distinction
that
i
can
think
of
for
picking
out
these
particular
contracts
and
applying
it
to
this
particular
gas.
i
think
possibly
the
worst
thing
about
these
contracts
is
that
it
really
doesn't
serve
the
benefit
that
it's
supposed
to
serve.
who
gets
the
savings
from
this
gas?
on
the
testimony
before
the
committee
69
percent
of
the
gas
that
kp&l...
kp&l
buys
goes
to
other
utilities;
it
goes
for
industrial
uses;
it
goes
for
sales
to
themselves
for
the
generation
of
electricity.
and
so
there
is
no
real
finding
that
any
benefit
goes
to
any
of
the
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
benefitted
by
this
act.
as...
just
to
quote
the
majority
report
that
recommended
this
bill
to
the
legislature,
it
would
provide
a
modicum
relief
to
some
people
who
have
the
need
for
utility
use
of
this
gas.
it's
just
extremely
limited
in
nature,
and
its
narrow
scope
totally
condemns
it.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
yes,
your
honor,
it
did,
which
is--
mr.
gary
w.
davis
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
contract
clause
just
applies
to
state
action,
not
to
federal
action.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
i
personally
do
not,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
interesting
to
contrast
the
position
of
what
was
going
on
with
the
natural
gas
act
when
the
federal
power
commission
was
regulating
things
and
this
court,
for
example,
in
the
permian
basin
area
rate
cases
where
the
federal
government
was
regulating
price
escalation
provisions.
they
pointed
out
that
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
that
provided
some
equity
to
the
matter
was
the
fact
that
even
there
where
the
federal
government
was
action,
the
part...
federal
government
was
acting,
the
parties
could
terminate
the
contracts.
they
didn't
have
to
continue
to
sell
them
at
these
prices.
and,
of
course,
this
is
one
thing
that
makes
the
impairment
in
this
case.
not
only
must
erg
continue
to
sell
its
gas
at
prices
far
below
what
it
bargained
for,
but
it
can't
even
terminate
the
contracts.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
your
honor,
the
section
602
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
provides
that
the
states
may
enact
lower
prices
for
gas
produced
in
the
state
than
that
prescribed
by
the
act.
it's
not
mandatory
that
they
do
so,
and
it's
not
an
invitation
that
they
do
so.
there
is
a
question...
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
in
quoting
the
legislative
history
it
was
pointed
out
and
believed
that
this
was
a
ceding
of
the
interstate
commerce
power,
and
that
this
section
602
not
only
provided
a
right
in
the
states
to
prescribe
a
rate
for
intrastate
gas
but
also
for
interstate
gas.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
that's
exactly
right,
but
that's...
that's
what...
if
that's
correct,
that
makes
this
statute
even
worse,
because
we're
not
talking...
it's
just
that
much
smaller
percentage
of
the
gas
that
you're
regulating.
it's
just
that
much
smaller
of
the
gas
that
could
be
regulated,
and
it
makes
it
that
much
more
discriminatory;
in
other
words,
where
you
just
pick
out
intrastate
gas
and
then
you
just
pick
out
a
piece
of
that
intrastate
gas
to
regulation.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
it
was
strictly
on
the
kansas
acts,
and
it's
only
the
kansas
act
that
precludes
the
operation
of
these
two
price
provisions.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
your
honor,
it
also
differentiates
with
regard
to
intrastate
gas.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
the
legislative
history
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
one
of
the
things
they
were
doing
was
sanctifying
the
present
intrastate
contract
because
there
they
were
dealing
with
an
area
where...
where,
for
one,
the
gas
would
be
covered
by
contracts
that
were
not
regulated.
and
that's
why
they
set
up,
in
my...
set
up
a
special
provision
for
intrastate
gas
prior
to
the
ngpa
and
set
a
price
that
was
comparable
to
the
section
102
price.
i'd
just
like
to
say
in
summary
that
in
this
case
there
has
been...
there's
no
question
that
the
parties
would
not
have
entered
into
these
contracts
but
for
these
price
escalation
provisions.
there
is
no
question
that
erg
has
been
substantially
impaired
by
this
kansas
statute.
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
a
statute
that
is
extremely
limited
in
scope.
and
there
is
no
question...
and
as
i
say,
possibly
the
worst
part
of
the
statute
is
there
is
no
finding
that
it
really
serves
any
benefit
that
is
supposed
to
be
served.
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
for
example,
said
for
kp&l,
was
to
the
effect
that
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
relief,
if
any,
was
being
afforded
to
the
people
who
might
really
need
some
help
as
a
result
of
increasing
prices.
thank
you.
mr.
gary
w.
davis
i
just
want
to
make
a
few
points,
your
honor.
first
off,
this
is
the
first
time
i've
ever
heard
this
argument
that
the
section
105
and
the
section
102
price
is
anything
different.
secondarily,
there
is...
until
this
moment
i
thought
there
was
no
argument
that
our
contracts
have
been
impaired.
looking
at
page
23a
of
the
appendix
to
jursidictional
statement,
which
is
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
decision,
it
says,
"the
statute
obviously
was
intended
to
and
does
impair
the
rights
of
erg
under
the
contracts.
"
with
regard
to
this
applicable
laws
provision
that
mr.
kelsey
has
talked
about,
first
off,
that
is
a
standard
provision
that
you
see
in
almost
every
contract.
secondarily,
i
see
no
way
that
it
can
possibly
be
construed
to
mean
that
it
means
that
it's
subject
to
invalid
state
laws.
and
furthermore,
as
just
a
last
point
on
the
intent
of
the
parties
under
that
applicable
laws
provision,
there
is
the
last
sentence
that
says,
"in
effect,
notwithstanding
any
such
applicable
laws,
such
applicable
laws
shall
not
prevent
energy
reserves
from
exercising
its
right
of
termination
if
it
did
not
receive
the
price
increases
promised
by
these
two
price
escalation
provisions.
"
the
other
provision,
throughout
this
case
kp&l
has
tried
to
picture
itself
as
a
benevolent
institution.
in
the
testimony
in
which
they
were
justifying
these
contracts
before
the
kansas
corporation
commission,
their
vice
president
and
a
member
of
their
board
of
directors
testified
at
length.
he
testified
that
if
kp&l
was
not
entitled
to
enter
into
these
contracts
that
they
would
lose
the
value
of
their
investment
of
$3,600,000
because
they
would
lose
the
value
of
the
gas-gathering
facilities.
to
say
that
they
don't
have
a
financial
interest
is
ridiculous.
secondarily,
kp&l
doesn't
think
themselves
that
they
have
a
right
to
pass
this
through.
when
the
price
increase
was
triggered
in
1978,
what'd
they
do?
they
applied
to
the
kansas
corporation
commission
for
permission
to
pass
it
through.
they
did
the
same
thing
in
february
of
1979.
and
they
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
these
price
increases
are
in
nowise
automatics.
i
would
simply...
i
would
ask
the
court
to
do
one
other
thing,
and
that
is
to
look
at
55-1408.
we
call
it
the
section
8
of
the
act.
what
that
cat
authorizes
the
parties
to
do
is
to
renegotiate
the
price
provisions
to
any
price
they
want
up
to
the
legal
ceiling.
obviously,
energy
reserves
wants
the
price
that
it
contracted
to
receive.
what
that
means
is
that
the
kansas
legislature
has
delegated
to
kansas
power
and
light
the
power
and
authority
to
totally
avoid
all
of
the
price
limitations
that
are
contained
in
this
kansas
act.
they've
turned
a
bilateral
contract
into
a
totally
unilateral
contract.
thank
you.
