justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
davis,
certainly
the
legislature
has
some
right
to
target
a
particular
area
of
perceived
danger
or
problem,
doesn't
it,
without
making
the
rule
that
adopts
for
that
area
applicable
right
across
the
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kelsey--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--supposing
that
in
the
allied
structural
steel
case
the
pension
contract
between
allied
structural
steel
and
the
pension
trustees
had
provided
that
it
was
subject
to
all
provisions
of
state
law,
or
state
and
federal
law...
a
provision
i
think
is
probably
not
uncommon
in
most
contracts.
do
you
think
that
would
have
resulted
in
the
allied
structural
steel
case
coming
out
differently?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying,
in
effect,
that
even
had
congress
not
passed
this
statute,
which
seems
to
be
the
subject
of
most
of
the
discussion
of
the
case,
that
energy
reserves
would
be
in
no
better
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
say
in
no
worse
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
kansas
legislature
hadn't
passed
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
kansas
statute
had
no
effect
on
what
energy
reserves
was
entitled
to
receive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
well,
isn't
your
theory
quite
different
from
that
of
the
kansas
supreme
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
the
theory
you're
now
arguing
different
from
that
in
which
the
kansas
supreme
court
upheld
the
act,
the
kansas
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
the
kansas
supreme
court
obviously
felt
obligated
to
deal
with
the
energy
reserves
claim
of
impairment
of
contract
obligation,
and
it
didn't
go
off
on
the
ground
that
you
now
urge
that
we
do,
that
the
contract
had
a
provision
that
said
it
would
be
subject
to
all
state
law.
it
went
through
a
constitutional
analysis.
i
understand
from
your
argument
that
that
really
isn't
necessary.
