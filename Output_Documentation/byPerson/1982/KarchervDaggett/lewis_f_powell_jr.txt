justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
have
you
finished
answering
that
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
wanted
to
ask
you
another
one.
which
of
those
districts
is
contiguous
only
for
yachtsmen
as
the
dissenting
judge
suggested?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
did
not
quite
hear
you--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--are
there
two
bodies
of
water
that
have
to
be
crossed?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
there
two
bodies
of
water
or
only
one?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
any
district
prior
to
1980
have
that
problem?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
prior
to
this
redistricting.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
many
of
those
districts
have
any
genuine
community
of
interest?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
many
of
them
have
genuine
community
of
interest
either
economic,
social
or
political?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
think,
in
kirkpatrick--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
kirkpatrick
say
that
community
of
interest
was
relevant
at
all
in
cases
of
this
kind?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
judge
gibbons
said
that
minority
interest
was
pretextual
in
this
case,
didn't
he?
