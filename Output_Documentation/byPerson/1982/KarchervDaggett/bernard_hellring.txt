mr.
bernard
hellring
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
striking
down
the
statute
which
is
represented
by
this
exhibit
which
was
received
in
evidence
by
the
district
court,
the
court
below
said
that
since
there
were
a
number
of
other
plans
available
to
the
legislature
including
several
which
had
been
introduced
as
bills
which
had
smaller
population
deviations,
and
since
this
redistricting
statute
was
not
the
unavoidable
result
of
a
good
faith
effort
to
arrive
at
the
smallest
deviations
in
population,
and
since
the
record
contained
no
justification
for
the
population
deviation
contained
in
this
statute,
that
it
must
be
declared
unconstitutional
under
the
principles
enunciated
by
this
court
in
wesberry
and
its
progeny
kirkpatrick
and
white.
the
record
contains
no
suggestion
of
any
good
faith
effort
or
indeed
any
effort
to
consider
other
plans
with
smaller
population
deviations.
there
was
a
justification
argued
which
was
made
up
later
after
the
suit
was
started
in
which
it
was
suggested
by
the
appellants
that
they
had
some
minority
adjustment
problems
with
respect
particularly
to
one
of
the
districts,
and
the
three
judges
on
the
panel
below
found
as
a
fact
that
this
was
a
phony,
that
it
was
a
pretext,
that
it
was
an
attempt
to
use
a
minority
argument
in
order
to
justify
something
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
a
minority
issue
and
to
use
improperly
and
in
an
insulting
manner
the
problem
of
minorities
in
order
to
justify
a
statute
which
was
the
result
of
bad
faith.
looking
at
this
picture
of
the
redistricting
suggests
the
word
gerrymander.
gerrymander
has
become
a
term
of
obloquy.
since
i
was
in
my
earliest
days
in
school,
i
remember
being
taught
about
gerrymander.
why
do
we
not
like
gerrymandering?
why
did
the
dissenting
judge
below,
judge
gibbons,
say
that
as
a
citizen
of
new
jersey,
he
was
disturbed
by
looking
at
this
exhibit.
because
gerrymandering
suggests
the
use
of
base
motives.
it
suggests
that
a
citizen
who
votes
is
wasting
his
time
because
his
vote
has
been
snicked
around
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
count
for
very
little.
mr.
bernard
hellring
i
would
suggest
looking
at
this
map
and
saying
that
twisting
district
number
seven
in
such
a
way
that
it
has
come
to
be
known
as
the
fishhook
district
is
gerrymandering.
that
having
another
fishhook
in
reverse
form
on
the
other
side--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--in
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
i
think
this
is
what
it
means
under
the
cases
decided
by
this
court.
this
court
has
thus
far
said,
we
will
avoid
the
question
of
whether
gerrymandering
in
any
form
and
to
any
extent
is
by
itself
unconstitutional.
wells
said
it
on
the
same
day
as
kirkpatrick
was
decided.
justice
brennan
said,
we
are
not
taking
a
position
one
way
or
the
other.
there
have
been
other
instances
in
which
that
issue
has
been
avoided.
it
need
not
be
dealt
with
in
this
case
in
order
to
sustain
the
decision
below
on
a
constitutional
basis,
but
it
fits
in
any
way
in
the
following
manner.
kirkpatrick
says
that
a
population
deviation
is
no
good
if
it
is
the
unavoidable...
is
no
good
unless
it
is
the
unavoidable
result
of
a
good
faith
effort
to
arrive
at
the
lowest
possible
population
deviation.
this
shows
lack
of
good
faith
because
the
gerrymandering
is
so
extreme,
so
tortured
that
it
is
one
piece
of
evidence,
not
necessarily
absolutely
conclusive,
but
surely
evidence
of
bad
faith.
mr.
bernard
hellring
yes,
it
does.
we
respect
straight
lines.
crooked
lines
we
do
not
like.
the
people
who
do
the
voting
find
that
crooked
lines,
which
are
tortured
in
such
a
way
to
embarrass
two
congressmen
into
running
against
each
other,
to
put
the
homes
of
two
congressmen
in
the
same
district
by
lording
a
giggum.
mr.
bernard
hellring
it
is,
and
it
is
in
the
record.
this
represents
a
degree
of
gerrymandering
which
is
so
extreme
and
so
far
different
from
anything
that
has
happened
before
in
new
jersey
that
itself
is
evidence
of
bad
faith.
now,
i
have
to
talk
about
bad
faith--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--we
have
none.
this
court
has
avoided
the
question.
i
am
not
suggesting--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--well,
but
in
that
case
you
were
dealing
with
not
a
congressional
redistricting--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--justice
white--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--not
in
a
congressional
redistricting
case,
and
this
court
has
expressed
repeatedly
the
importance
of
maintaining--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--your
honor,
please,
i
am
not
arguing
that
case.
this
is
a
congressional
redistricting
case--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--no.
i
am
making
an
argument
under
kirkpatrick.
mr.
bernard
hellring
i
am
making
an
argument--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--it
is
not
a
constitutional
argument.
mr.
bernard
hellring
it
is
an
argument
that
under
kirkpatrick--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--kirkpatrick
is
a
statement
by
this
court
on
the
meaning
of
article
i,
section
2
of
the
united
states
constitution
when
it
says
that
the
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
shall
be
elected
by
the
people.
senators--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--well--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--well,
if
your
honor,
please,
i
am
not
making
an
equal
protection
argument,
and
my
argument
about
gerrymandering
is
a
constitutional
argument
only
in
the
sense
that
it
relates
to
the
issue
of
good
faith
as
that
is
given
to
us
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
testing...
for
the
purpose
of
testing
whether
a
given
population
deviation
in
a
given
statute
is
or
is
not
the
unavoidable
result
of
a
good
faith
effort
to
arrive
at
the
smallest
possible
population
deviation.
and,
i
would
suggest,
justice
white,
that
if
this
court
is
ready
to
deal
with
gerrymandering
all
by
itself
as
a
constitutional
issue
and
sees
the
necessity
of
doing
so
in
this
case,
that
it
is
a
perfect
case
for
you
to
do
it
in.
mr.
bernard
hellring
but,
you
would
not
have.
mr.
reock
suggested
a
plan
more
than
six
months
before
this
one
was
adopted
in
which
there
was
not
any
such
gerrymandering,
and
it
was
based
solely
on
the
problems
of
population
deviation
without
doing
any
harm
to
compactness
or
state
interest
or
anything
else.
and,
it
did
not
put
congressmen
running
against
each
other
or
anything
else.
but,
if
your
honor
please,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
find
gerrymandering
as
a
concept
to
be
an
unconstitutional
thing.
that
may
come
in
a
later
case.
if
you
want
to
do
it
in
this
case,
it
is
a
good
case
to
do
it
in,
but
you
do
not
need
to.
this
case
can
be
well
determined
and
upheld
and
affirmed
solely
on
the
basis
that
the
population
deviation
here
was
not
the
unavoidable
result
of
a
good
faith
effort
to
arrive
at
the
smallest
population
deviation.
and,
if
your
honor,
justice
white,
means
to
suggest
that
the
smallest
population
deviation
is
not
necessarily
the
most
desirable,
then
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
be
ready
to
change
its
ideas
about
one
man-one
vote.
mr.
bernard
hellring
well,
may
i
then
suggest,
your
honor,
that
if
there
is
any
addition
to
be
made
by
this
court
in
this
case
by
way
of
further
explanation
of
the
meaning
of
article
i,
section
2
by
way
of
further
discussion
as
to
what
kirkpatrick
may
not
have
said
enough
times
and
what
your
honor,
justice
white,
said
in
white
against
weiser
was
not
said
enough
times,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
should
take
the
occasion
to
reemphasize
the
doctrine
of
one
man-one
vote.
the
cry
of
happiness
and
joy
and
respect
that
rose
up
from
all
parts
of
this
nation
at
the
time
of
baker
against
carr
and
wesberry
is
one
of
the
most
stunning
juridical
acts
in
this
century
when
the
idea
of
one
man-one
vote
was
established.
this
is
surely
not
the
time
to
go
backwards
on
that--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
bernard
hellring
your
honor
has
me
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
know
it
was
not
even
unanimous
on
this
court.
a
great
justice,
mr.
justice
harlan
did
not
agree
with
it.
another
great
justice,
your
teacher,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mine,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
thought
it
was
a
silly
thing
to
get
involved
in
the
political
thicket
of
it.
i
am
well
aware
that
great
principles
are
not
necessarily
brought
to
light
on
a
unanimous
basis.
and,
i
do
hope
that
that
great
principle
will
not
be
injured
by
this
court
now.
three
thousand
six
hundred
seventy-four
people
care
whether
it
is
one
man-one
vote
particularly
in
the
fourth
district
where
they
have
2,261
too
many
and
in
the
sixth
district
where
they
have
1,500
or
so
too
few,
totalling
a
difference
between
them
of
3,674...
that
is
people...
and,
in
a
state
of
new
jersey
where
in
the
last
gubernatorial
election
the
present
governor
sits
because
he
had
a
plurality
of
1,700
votes.
mr.
bernard
hellring
and
that
is
in
the
whole
state.
mr.
bernard
hellring
i
would
not.
that
would
be
a
constitutional
act,
and
it
should
not
be
struck
down
under
kirkpatrick
or
white
or
wesberry.
mr.
bernard
hellring
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--yes.
that
would
be
a
second
effort
by
the
legislature,
not
by
the
court?
mr.
bernard
hellring
well,
in
such
a
case
where
the
population
deviation
was
zero,
then
it
should
be
held
constitutional
and
not
struck
down
unless
this
court
is
ready
to
say
that
we
will
consider
whether
gerrymandering
alone
in
its
most
extreme
form
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
bernard
hellring
but
under
the
law
that
exists--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--under
the
law
that
exists
today,
it
is
a
constitutional
act.
mr.
bernard
hellring
yes.
mr.
bernard
hellring
well,
as
to
reapportionment
it
is
certain--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--yes,
and
i
think
that
is,
while
the
facts
are
different
that
is
generally
the
concept
of
gaffney,
which
justice
white
mentioned.
mr.
bernard
hellring
yes.
i
do
not
remember
the
exact
torturing
that
was
done
in
that...
the
exact
amount
of
gerrymandering
that
was
done
there,
but
i
would
not,
based
upon
my
recollection
of
that
case
and
the
description
of
what--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--yes.
no,
i
would
not
consider
that
gerrymandering.
mr.
bernard
hellring
well,
if
your
honor,
please,
political
motivations--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--yes,
and
political
motivations
are
nothing
that
i--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--well,
i
did
not
say
that
a
gerrymander
was
something
which
was
describable
purely
because
it
was
something
done
for
political
motivations.
we
have
political
motivations
all
day
long--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--you
see--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--it
depends
upon
what
it
did
to
the
people.
you
see,
it
is
not--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--but,
you
see,
if
it
twists
and
turns
and
squeaks
and
makes
peculiar
lines
bad
enough
in
order
to
prevent
people
in
a
certain
section
from
having
a
chance
to
vote
in
the
place
where
they
have
normally
been
voting
solely
to
change
the
results
and
that
is
the
purpose
and
that
is
the
result,
that
is
a
sign
of
bad
faith.
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
enough
for
unconstitutionality.
mr.
bernard
hellring
no,
it
has
to
have
the
element
of
destroying
what
is
normal
for
purposes
which
are
bad.
mr.
bernard
hellring
well,
i
would
like
to
say
it
is
all
right--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--i
would
like
to
say
that
i
agree
with
everything
your
honor
put
in
your
honor's
question,
and
i
agree
with
almost
all
of
it
except
the
word
"neatness".
i
am
not
looking
for
neatness.
this
is
so--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--reasonable
compactness...
reasonable.
i
am
looking
for
something
which
is
not
so
unreasonable--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--not
yet.
this
court
has
never
said
that
it
is.
and,
all
i
am
arguing
with
respect
to
gerrymandering
in
this
case
before
this
court
today
is
that
it
demonstrates
that
there
was
no
good
faith
effort
by
this
legislature
to
arrive
at
the
lowest
population
deviation
and
that
this
was
not
the
result...
the
unavoidable
result--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--that
was
in
kirkpatrick.
mr.
bernard
hellring
well,
i
think
there
could
be
others.
none
that
have
ever
been
suggested
so
far
as
i
know
have
as
yet
been
acceptable
to
this
court.
mr.
bernard
hellring
compactness
in
the
sense
of
avoiding
extremes
in
gerrymandering,
would
be
one.
mr.
bernard
hellring
based
on
degree.
if
the
degree
of
gerrymandering
were
very,
very
different,
then
i
would
say
that
would
be
an
acceptable
reason
and
an
important
reason.
gerrymandering,
of
course,
partakes
of
some
of
these
other
things
that
your
honor
referred
to,
such
as
avoiding
contests
between
two
incumbent
representatives
and
things
of
that
sort.
it
is
part
of
the
seamless
web
of
all
of
the
reasons
that
go
into
the
determinations
made
by
a
legislature.
i--
mr.
bernard
hellring
--it
is,
but
i
know
that
this
court
has
so
far
not
accepted
that
as
a
valid
ground.
i
would
urge
it
upon
this
court,
it
is
not
necessary
to
argue
that
in
order
to
win
this
case
and
have
it
affirmed
by
this
court.
but,
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
yes,
i
would
consider
that
to
be
a
very
important
and
valid
consideration
for
a
court
to
take
into
consideration.
now,
appellants
have
enjoyed
in
this
case
at
all
levels
including
this
court
to
talk
about
population
deviations
which
are
within
the
limits
of
the
statistical
imprecisions
of
the
census
which
makes
them
equal
to
zero.
if
that
has
any
meaning
at
all,
and
i
suggest
it
does
not,
then
it
can
only
mean
that
any
population
deviation
which
already
is
created
by
the
legislature
in
adopting
a
particular
redistricting
plan
has
got
to
be
a
much
greater
population
deviation
if
you
superimpose
upon
it
and
add
to
it
the
statistical
imprecision
of
any
census
no
matter
what
that
statistical
imprecision
may
be.
now,
if
the
statistical
imprecision
somewhere
up
on
high
in
the
omnipresent
sky,
which
we
do
not
know
what
it
is,
is
less
than
0.7
of
a
percent
as
the
population
deviation
here
is,
then
their
argument
falls
for
that
reason.
but,
if
it
is
more,
let's
say
if
it
is
one
percent,
or
one
and
one-half
or
as
was
largely
studied
eight
or
nine
years
after
the
1970
census
a
statistical
imprecision
of
two
and
one-half
to
2.6
percent...
2.6
percent
supposedly...
if
it
is
that
high
then
you
have
to
add
about
12,000
to
15,000
people
to
the
3,674
people
by
which
you
already
have
a
population
deviation.
so,
that
this
argument
about
population
deviation
within
the
confines
of
statistical
imprecisions
of
the
census
is
backwards
because
if
you
strive
for
zero
population
deviation
it
may
very
well
be
that
because
of
the
statistical
imprecisions
of
any
census
in
the
nature
of
things,
there
would
any
way
be
some
kind
of
a
deviation.
but,
why
strive
for
anything
different
from
zero?
if
you
strive
for
a
one
percent
de
minimus
under
the
argument
of
statistical
imprecision,
then
the
cases
before
you
will
then
say
why
not
1.3?
why
not
1.4?
why
one
percent?
why
not
one
percent,
two
percent,
three
percent,
four
percent,
six
percent?
where
do
we
stop?
the
right
answer
is
one
man-one
vote.
three
thousand
six
hundred
seventy-four
is
too
many
unless
it
is
the
result,
the
unavoidable
result,
of
a
good
faith
effort...
a
good
faith
effort,
not
this...
on
the
part
of
a
legislature
in
adopting
a
redistricting
plan.
in
this
case
there
has
been
no
showing
of
good
faith.
the
court
below
annexed
to
its
opinion
what
it
called
a
remarkable
document
which
was
a
letter
from
the
speaker
of
the
assembly
to
dr.
reock
of
rutgers
university
in
response
a
few
days
after
dr.
reock
sent
his
proposed
lowest
population
deviation
plan
to
all
the
members
of
the
legislature,
he
got
a
letter
from
speaker
jackman
which
they
recall...
which
they
call
a
remarkable
document,
and
which
says,
you
are
silly
if
you
think
that
we
are
going
to
pay
attention
to
population
deviation
as
the
main
event.
we
are
realistic
legislators
and
we
know
we
have
got
the
power
now
because
we
have
got
a
democratic
house
and
a
democratic
senate
and
a
democratic
governor,
and
we
are
going
to
get
it
before
he
leaves
office,
and
on
the
day
that
the
democratic
governor
left
office,
minutes
before
he
left
office,
he
signed
this
bill
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
the
objectives
which
are
described
in
speaker
jackman's
letter
which
is
annexed
to
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
which
is
before
your
honors.
this
was
coupled
by
the
testimony
of
the
majority
leader
of
the
assembly
who
says,
well,
its
population
deviation
is
small.
that
is
an
aspiration
somewhere.
that
is
not
the
real
thing
we
have
got
to
consider.
a
letter
by
another
assemblyman
to
his
constituents
and
to
other
important
leaders
in
the
state
in
his
party
saying,
now
this
new
statute
that
has
been
adopted,
there
is
talk
about
changing
it.
let's
get
behind
it
because
you
know
what
it
does
for
us.
nevermind
the
population
deviation
question
being
at
its
lowest.
these
are
clear
pieces
of
evidence
in
this
record
alongside
of
this
map
to
show
that
instead
of
a
good
faith
effort,
there
was
a
bad
faith
effort.
thank
you.
