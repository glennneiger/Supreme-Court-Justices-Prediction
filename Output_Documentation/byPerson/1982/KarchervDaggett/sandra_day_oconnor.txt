do
we
really
know
what
the
statistical
deviation
is
on
variance
from
the
census
figures?
do
we
really
have
anything
to
go
by?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
my
understanding,
though,
that
there
was
no
real
consensus
if
you
will,
on
what
the
most
recent
census
variation
might
be
and
if
there
is
such
a
variation
people
have
spoken
in
national
terms
which
would
not
necessarily
focus
it
on
that--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
hellring,
it
sounds
to
me
like
your
argument
concedes
that
every
party
in
power
when
drawing
district
lines
can
and
will
try
to
benefit
its
own
party
members
in
drawing
those
lines.
but,
your
concern
is
with
the
compactness
or
neatness
of
the
lines
that
are
drawn
forming
resulting
districts
that
are
more
compact,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
to
what
extent
do
we
have
to
require
compact
districts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
looking
for
compactness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
constitutional
requirement
in
these
redistricting...
compactness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
suppose
the
legislature
had
before
it
two
plans
with
very
minor
population
differences,
one
slightly
higher
than
the
other.
what
possible
justifications
do
you
agree
the
constitution
would
permit
to
be
considered
for
the
legislature
to
adopt
the
plan
with
the
slightly
higher
deviation
and
still
be
acceptable?
our
court
has
suggested,
for
example,
anticipated
population
shifts
would
justify
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
our
court
has
suggested
protecting
incumbents
as
a
possible
justification.
is
there
any
other
justification
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
propose
that
any
others
should
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
that
it
would
be
your
view
that
if
the
higher
deviation
were
more
compact
on
the
map
that
that
would
be
a
justification
for
the
higher
deviation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
your
view
that
protection
of
municipal
or
district
boundaries
is
a
consideration
that
should
permit
a
higher
deviation.
