justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
lack
of
compactness
of
the
districts
that
justice
powell
eluded
to
with
district
3,
i
guess
it
is.
it
is
kind
of
irregularly
shaped.
as
i
remember
the
rutgers
professor's
submission,
he
included
compactness
as
one
of
the
tests
of
whether
the
plan
was
a
satisfactory
one.
did
the
legislature
in
this
drafting
this
plan
give
any
attention
at
all
to
the
desirability
of
compact
districts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
there
were
other
concerns.
did
they
include--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
as
of
any
value
at
all
to
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
also
i
suppose,
preserving
the
majority
control
of
the
legislature?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
that
was
admittedly
one
of
the
concerns?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
preserving
majority
control
of
the
maximum
number
of
districts
possible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
two
questions
about
your
gerrymandering
argument
and
the
base
motive
that
you
described
to
the
dominant
party
in
trying
to
have
as
many
districts
of
the
same
political
flavor.
supposing
you
had
two
plans
with
equal
population
disparity,
equally
satisfied
the
one
person-one
vote
rule,
and
equally
compact,
but
you
could
demonstrate
by
evidence
that
the
majority
selected
one
because
they
thought
they
would
elect
more
of
their
fellow
republicans
or
democrats
by
that
plan
rather
than
the
other,
and
they
were
frank
about
it.
they
said
we
are
in
control
we
might
as
well
take
advantage
of
our
control.
would
you
say
that
was
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
give
you
a
second
case,
then.
supposing
you
had
this
plan
here
and
the
court
holds
it
unconstitutional,
so
you
go
back
to
the
drawing
board.
and
the
legislature
goes
back
and
is
able
to
achieve
population
equality
to
the
very
last
digit
by
doing
some
more
gerrymandering,
and
that
then
comes
back
with
no
numerical
problem
but
the
kind
of
distortion
or
even
more
severe
distortion
we
see
here.
would
you
say
that
was
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
second
you
say
the
reason
is
the
same
as
in
my
other
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
your
answer.
i
do
not
want
you
to
rephrase
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
keep
rephrasing
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it
would
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
you
think
that
is
what
gaffney
decides?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
there
was
an
attempt
to
achieve
rough
parity
between
the
parties,
not
have
one
exploit
its
dominance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
would
you
describe
gaffney
as
a
gerrymander.
i
notice
he
does,
but
would
you
have?
because
you
were
the
one
who
brought
the
term
up
during
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
objective
there
was
to
achieve
rough
parity
between
the
parties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
one
very
brief
question
on
the
compactness
problem
and
the
study,
the
rutgers
study
that
you
called
our
attention
to.
the
professor
has
a
table
which
he
talks
about
the
degree
of
compactness
for
each
of
his
districts,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
the
degree
of
compactness
of
your
districts?
