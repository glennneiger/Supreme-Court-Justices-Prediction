justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
any
cases
in
this
court
that
invalidated
gerrymandering
of
the
kind
you
have
just
described?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
not
avoided...
we
have
not
always
avoided
the
question
of
a
gerrymander.
we
have
sustained
a
political
gerrymander
in
gaffney
against
cummings.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
way
you
talk
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
it
is
state
or
federal.
gerrymander
is
bad.
we
like
straight
lines
not
crooked
lines
and
drawing
districts
for
political
purposes
is
a
base
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
yet,
gaffney
against
cummings
held
quite
to
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
not
think
that
the
political
gerrymandering...
you
concede
the
political
gerrymander
in
gaffney
against
cummings
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
making
a
constitutional
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
making
a
constitutional
argument
or
a
statutory
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
constitutional,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
kirkpatrick?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
making
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
an
equal
protection
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
achieved
absolute
equality...
you
took
the
very
lowest
plan
there
was
and
you
still
had
fishhook
and
running
back
districts
and
they
still
were
in
that
form
for
political
purposes--
justice
byron
r.
white
--change
its
ideas
if
kirkpatrick
and
white
against
weiser
is
supposed
to
be
read
that
way,
they
ought
to
cut
into
those
two
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
lines
were
drawn
with
political
motivations,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
are
not
arguing
about
what
a
gerrymander
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is
done
deliberately
to
make
sure
that
a
republican
rather
than
a
democrat
is
elected
in
this
district,
would
you
call
that
a
gerrymander
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
call
it
a
gerrymander
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
made
sure
that
democrats
in
the
particular
district
were
going
to
lose
every
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
kind
of
gerrymander
has
to
have
the
element
of
bad
faith
in
it?
