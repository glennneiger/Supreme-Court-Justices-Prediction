mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
my
name
is
kenneth
j
guido,
jr.
i
represent
the
new
jersey
legislature
and
the
democratic
members
of
congress
in
this
case.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
divided
three-judge
district
court
in
new
jersey,
which
struck
down
a
congressional
reapportionment
plan
enacted
by
the
new
jersey
legislature.
on
january
19,
1982
new
jersey
enacted
a
reapportionment
plan
for
the
election
of
united
states
house
of
representatives
with
a
deviation
that
falls
within
the
statistical
imprecision
of
the
census
data.
the
plan
in
accordance
with
the
notification
from
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
representatives
based
on
the
1980
decennial
census
data
reduced
the
number
of
districts
from
15
to
14.
the
plan
as
enacted
creates
14
districts
with
an
average
population
deviation
of
0.135
percent
and
a
maximum
deviation
between
the
smallest
and
largest
districts
of
less
than
0.7
of
one
percent.
the
legislature's
criteria
for
redistricting
was
first
numerical
equality.
the
leadership
agreed
that
no
plan
would
be
considered
with
deviations
over
one
percent
and
that
lesser
deviations
would
be
sought.
additional
legislative
criteria
which
was
to
be
secondary
to
population
equality
were
to
protect
minority
interests
by
not
unnecessarily
diluting
black
votes
particularly
in
the
tenth
or
the
newark
district.
the
others
were
to
preserve
the
cores
of
existing
districts
as
much
as
possible
for
all
members
of
the
legislature
and
to
preserve
municipal
boundaries,
which,
in
new
jersey
because
there
are
so
many
of
them,
are
small
enough
to
be
building
blocks
for
reapportionment
purposes.
plaintiffs,
including
all
of
the
incumbent
republican
members
of
congress,
on
february
2nd
and
9,
1982
brought
suit
to
declare
this
statute
unconstitutional
because
they
believed
other
plans
submitted
to
the
legislature
would
have
reduced
the
variation
between
districts
to
even
lower
levels
than
the
0.7
of
one
percent
in
this
case.
the
cases
were
consolidated
and
submitted
on
depositions
affidavits,
and
exhibits
without
trial
upon
the
agreement
of
all
parties
to
this
action.
on
march
3,
1982,
the
three-judge
district
court
by
a
divided
vote
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional.
the
court
read
kirkpatrick
and
white,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
as
requiring
any
legislatively
drafted
congressional
redistricting
plan
to
be
held
unconstitutional
if
there
existed
the
possibility
that
a
plan
with
a
smaller
deviation
of
census
population
might
be
developed.
the
court
concluded
that
such
a
possibility
existed
in
this
case
and
struck
down
the
statute.
in
doing
so,
the
court
failed
to
consider
the
problems
undisputed
in
the
record
with
each
of
the
plans
rejected
by
the
legislature.
the
court
also
gave
little,
if
any,
consideration
to
other
criteria
such
as
preventing
the
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
in
certain
districts.
the
court
concluded
that
preventing
racial
dilution
did
not
justify
the
deviations
because
the
district
with
the
largest
black
vote,
district
10,
was
not
one
of
those
with
the
highest
deviation.
and,
finally,
the
district
court
rejected
the
appellants'
argument
that
the
as
nearly
as
practicable
standard
of
kirkpatrick
and
white
is
satisfied
when
the
population
deviation
is
even
less
than
the
statistical
imprecision
of
the
census.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
that
we
have
the
statement
of
dr.
trussell
who
is
a
demographer
at
princeton...
an
expert
demographer...
and
a
noted
authority
on
the
census.
in
fact,
he
participated
in
all
of
the
studies
that
the
census
has.
he--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--that
is
right.
dr.
trussell
is
the
only
one
who
has
focused
that
on
districts
as
small
as
congressional
districts
or
at
the
state
level.
if
i
may
return
to
my
argument...
the...
circuit
judge
gibbons
dissented.
he
concluded
that
where
the
deviation
between
the
districts
is
less
than
the
recognized
margin
of
error
a
good
faith
effort
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
to
achieve
numerical
equality
has
been
shown
as
a
matter
of
law.
and,
courts
in
such
situations
should
not
substitute
their
judgment
for
that
of
the
legislature.
the
appellants
on
march
8
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
and
applied
for
stay
of
the
judgment
pending
appeal
to
this
court.
on
march
15,
justice
brennan
stayed
the
district
court's
judgment.
as
justice
brennan
recognized
in
granting
appellants'
application
for
a
stay,
this
appeal
presents
the
question
whether
the
proper
interpretation
of
this...
what
are
the
proper
interpretations
of
the
standards
laid
out
in
kirkpatrick
v.
preisler.
do
they
require
absolute
equality,
or
do
they
allow
for
some
latitude
given
the
arguable
statistical
insignificant
variance
argued
in
this
case?
in
this
case,
the
essence
of
what
we
are
arguing
about
is
whether
a
variance
of
less
than
0.7
of
one
percent
is
not
good
enough
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
kirkpatrick,
wesberry
and
white.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
in
terms
of
people
it
translates
into
a
deviation
of
approximately,
i
think,
3,551
people
between
the
largest
and
the
smallest.
that
is
much
different
than
in
the
figures
that
were
in
wesberry,
for
example.
in
wesberry
it
was
140
percent
deviation
or
551,000
people.
in
kirkpatrick,
the
deviation
was
5.97
percent,
or
25,000
people.
in
white,
it
was
4.13,
or
19,275
people.
the
deviations
in
this
case
are
less
than
the
deviations
in
11
other
plans
adopted
in
other
states
and
fall
within
the
range
of,
i
think,
approximately
five
other
states.
at
the
outset,
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus
on
the
appropriate
standard
of
review
in
this
case,
because
the
appellees
here
and
two
members
of
the
district
court
below
interpreted
the
standards
of
kirkpatrick
and
white
to
mean
that
a
redistricting
plan
adopted
by
a
state
legislature
is
automatically
unconstitutional
no
matter
how
low
a
deviation
it
contains
as
long
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
a
plan
with
a
lower
deviation.
this
is
true,
they
argue,
no
matter
what
flaws
there
might
be
in
the
other
plans,
and
no
matter
what
the
statistical
imprecision
of
the
underlying
census
data
may
be.
in
reaching
this
incongruous
result,
the
appellee
has
ignored
the
admonition
of
this
court
in
white
that
from
the
beginning
we
have
recognized
that
reapportionment
is
primarily
a
matter
for
legislative
consideration
and
determination.
as
this
court
clearly
stated,
legislatures
have
primary
jurisdiction
over
legislative
reapportionment.
and,
districting
inevitably
has
sharp
political
impact,
and
inevitably
political
decisions
must
be
made
by
those
charged
with
the
task.
in
balancing
the
commands
of
the
one
man-one
vote
rule
of
this
court
against
the
requirement
of
the
primacy
of
the
legislature,
this
court
has
evolved
a
pragmatic
case-by-case
approach
in
litigating
these
issues.
in
wesberry,
it
said,
"as
nearly
as
is
practicable,
one
man's
vote
in
a
congressional
district
is
worth
as
much
as
another's.
"
and,
in
elaborating
on
this
standard
this
court
in
kirkpatrick
rejected
the
fixed
percentage
formula.
consequently,
as
this
court
concluded
in
white,
congressional
districts
pass
constitutional
muster
if
they
are
as
mathematically
equal
as
is
reasonably
possible.
in
reading
through
those
cases,
the
court
has
focused
on
a
number
of
factors
in
applying
these
standards.
the
first
is
the
magnitude
of
the
deviation.
the
court
has
spoken
in
kirkpatrick
of
markedly
reduced
deviations.
in
white,
it
talked
about
grossly
out
of
proportion.
the
court
has
traditionally
looked
at
the
accuracy
of
the
data
relied
upon
in
drawing
the
plan.
in
kirkpatrick
at
page
529
the
court
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
accuracy
of
the
data
can
be
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
and,
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
note
17,
we
point
out
that
the
court
in
mahan
and
in
burns
v.
richardson
recognized
that
there
may
even
be
situations
in
which
the
census
data
does
not
have
to
be
used
because
of
problems
of
accuracy.
the
third
factor
the
court
has
looked
to
in
determining
whether
a
plan
meets
constitutional
muster
is
the
extent
to
which
the
challenged
variances
fall
within
the
range
of
what
other
states
have
done.
i
have
just
pointed
out
to
you
where
the
statute
challenging
this
plan
falls
with
regard
to
other
states.
additionally,
the
fourth
factor
has
been
the
availability
of
acceptable
alternatives,
which
we
will
address
in
a
minute,
and
the
extent
to
which
there
exists
legitimate
justifications
for
the
deviations.
in
all
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
since
baker
v.
carr,
it
has
never
stricken
a
plan
with
a
variance
as
low
as
in
this
case.
as
i
said,
the
variances
in
this
case
are
no
where
near
those
of
wesberry,
kirkpatrick
and
white.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
we
will
address
is
the
question
of
the
inadequacies
of
those
plans.
if
you
wish
me
to
address
that
now--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--while
reviewing
court
drawn
plans
this
court
holds
to
a
higher
one
vote-one
man
standard
than
legislatively
drawn
plans,
this
court
has
upheld
plans
with
similar
deviations
to
that
plan
challenged
in
this
action
out
of
deference
to
the
legislature
although
it
holds
court
drawn
plans
to
a
higher
one
man-one
vote
standard.
significantly,
the
plan
approved
after
this
court's
decision
striking
the
statute
in
kirkpatrick
contained
a
deviation
of
0.629
percent.
in
essence,
the
same
deviation
challenged
in
that
action.
that
occurred
in
the
case
where
the
court
imposes
a
higher
standard
under
the
one
man-one
vote
principle
on
courts
when
they
draw
the
plans
than
on
legislatures.
however,
it
sustained
a
plan
with
a
similar
deviation.
the
other
factor
that
the
court
has
considered
is
the
precision
of
the
data
that
is
to
be
relied
upon.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
record
in
this
case
reveals
that
the
census
count
was
not
perfect.
it
is
not
an
entirely
accurate
enumeration
of
the
population.
its
imprecision
is
due
not
only
to
the
undercounting
of
illegal
aliens
as
the
appellees
contend,
but
also
to
the
undercounting
of
other
groups,
people
under
35,
people
over
65,
immigration
outmigration
and
certain
other
groups.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
in
the
record,
yes.
dr.
trussell's
statement
supports
that
and
all
of
the
attachments
that
are
included
with
that
include
all
of
the
studies
that
have
been
done
by
the
census
bureau
on
that
issue.
they
are
all
exhibits
as
attachments
to
his
statement--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--on
the
census
figures,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
since
those
were
the
only
figures
that
were
available
and
the
legislature
of
new
jersey
attempted
to
get
as
close
to
zero
as
possible,
even
in
recognition
that
there
was
an
error
factor
in
those
figures,
and
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
way,
as
a
practical
matter,
to
make
corrections
for
those
deviations.
so,
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
even
though
that
cannot
be
done,
this
court
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
should
recognize
that
it
should
not
require
something
to
be
done
by
the
legislature
that
is
essentially
physically
impossible.
they
took
the
best
available
data
that
was
available
to
them.
they
used
that
data.
that
data
has
imprecision
and
is
now
being
attacked
because
they
did
not
come
close
enough
to
zero
when,
in
fact,
no
one
knows
that
if
we
drew
a
plan
that
had
absolutely
zero
census
population
deviation
that
it
would
not
be
in
reality
a
plan
with
a
substantially
higher
deviation
than
the
0.7
of
one
percent
that
is
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
the
only...
in
the
district
court
the
dissenting
judge
relied
upon
that
information.
what
the
district
court
said
with
regard...
the
two
other
members
of
the
district
court
said
with
regard
to
that
is
that
essentially
here
this
is
the
argument
that
had
been
made
in
kirkpatrick
and
earlier
cases,
and,
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
law
we
are
disregarding
this
argument.
we
did
not
make--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
i
think
it
is
the
second
one.
it
seems
to
be
down
into
this
area.
it
also
turns--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--because
of
the
nature
of
that
district,
if
you
look
at
it
and
if
you
look
at
this--
even
if
you
made
that
district
square,
you
would
still
have
to
get
across
that
spit
by
being
a
yachtsman.
it
turns
out
that
the
shape--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--pardon?
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
it
would
have
to
be...
there
is
one
body
of
water
there.
yes,
that
is
my
understanding.
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
the
reality
is
that
even
if
we
drew
the
district
as
square,
you
would
still
have
to
at
certain
times
be
a
yachtsman
to
cross
it.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
at
that
time?
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
that
that
was
the
case
prior
to
1980,
except
for
the
spit
that
is
referred
to
by
the
dissenting
judge--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--in
all
of
these
districts?
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
is
my
understanding
and
justice
brennan
is
probably
much
more
familiar
with
it...
with
the
state
of
new
jersey
than
i
am--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--but
the
basic
goals
in
this
case
were
to
maintain
essentially
the
core
districts
from
the
1970
census
and
that
that
essentially
reflected
the
communities
of
interest
at
that
time
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there
needed
to
be
changes
because
there
was
a
loss
of
a
district.
all
of
those
factors,
your
honor,
i
think,
as
i
listed
in
the...
at
the
beginning,
maintaining
the
core
districts
meant
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
preserve
the
communities
of
interest
that
had
been
reflected
in
the
1970
reapportionment
as
drawn
by
the
district
court
previous
to
that
time.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
this
green
district
is
all
one
district.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
it
is
different
than
this--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--this
here
is
all
one
district.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
and
essentially
one
of
the
things
i
think
you
have
to
understand
is
if
you
look
back
at
the
appendix,
you
look
at
this
map
and
you
say,
well
you
look
at
these
districts
and
they
have
these
sort
of
puzzle
kind
of
shapes.
the
reality
is
that
in
new
jersey
the
building
blocks
that
were
used
were
municipalities
because
of
the
community
of
interest
concern
and
in
putting
together
those
building
blocks
in
such
a
way.
there
were
sufficient
numbers
of
them
so
that
you
could
satisfy
that
population
equality
requirement
and
as
a
consequence
because
you
use
those
boundaries
you
end
up
with
a
map
that
looks
like
this.
at
one
time
i
went
back
and
looked
at
all
of
the
maps
that
had
been
drawn
over
time
in
new
jersey
and
i
can
tell
you
that
if
anyone
thinks
that
this
is
a
strange
map,
there
have
always
been
strange
maps
in
this
regard
in
new
jersey,
primarily
because
municipalities
were
used
as
the
building
blocks;
two,
is
that
you
have
a
state
with
an
irregular
shape;
and
three,
with
a
very
high
population.
so
as
a
consequence,
you
end
up
with
a
map
that--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--in
kirkpatrick,
no
it
did
not,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
are
not
even
arguing
that
communities
of
interest
is
relevant.
what
we
are
arguing
here
is
that
essentially
the
statistical
imprecision
of
the
census
data
was
such
that
it
justifies
holding
that
this
plan
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
zero,
and
we
are
arguing
that
if
the
minute
deviation
in
this
case
is
not
justified
by
an
acceptance
of
the
statistical
imprecision,
that
the
concern
for
the
minority
interest
is
sufficient
to
justify
that
deviation.
we
are
arguing--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--your
honor,
what
the
court
said
in
this
case
about
the
minority
interest
was
that
essentially
there
was
no
connection...
they
could
not
find
a
linear
connection
between
the
tenth
district
and
the
fourth
district
that
concerns
the
minority
interest
was
affected
and
the
deviations
that
were
in
this
case.
as
a
practical
matter,
when
you
look
at
this
map,
it
is
impossible
after
the
fact
to
construct
the
cause
or
connection
between
minority
interest
and
the
interest
here.
the
only
thing
that
you
can
do
to
make
a
judgment
about
whether
the
legislature
appropriately
took
into
consideration
minority
interest
was
whether
the
plan
that
was
adopted
by
the
legislature
better
met
the
minority
concerns
than
the
other
plans
before
the
legislature.
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
we
have
demonstrated
that
the
plans
that
were
relied
upon
by
the
district
court,
two
of
which
did
not
even
exist
at
the
time
that
the
statute
challenged
in
this
case
was
adopted,
did
not
meet
the
interest
of
minority
interest
and
that
mayor
gibson
who
was
the
major
minority
leader
in
the
state
was
actively
lobbying
for
the
statute
passed
in
this
case
and
actively
lobbying
with
the
legislators
against
this
plan,
and,
in
fact,
no
plan
would
have
been
adopted
without
the
vote
of
minority
members
of
the
legislature,
and
it
was
this
plan
that
they
felt
best
represented
their
interests.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
all
three
members
on
the
panel
below
rejected
the
argument.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
i
remember
one
of
them
using
the
word
pretextual,
your
honor,
but
i
would
concede
that
point
for
purposes
of
the
argument,
and
that
the
basis
that
they
did
say
was
is
that
they
said
no
one
could
develop
a
linear
connection
between
the
deviations
and
the
concern
for
minority
voting
strength
in
this
case.
yes,
your
honor,
that...
and,
that
we
believe
that
that
conclusion
that
there
was
a
requirement
that
in
a
reapportionment
case
especially
with
the
deviation
of
0.7
of
one
percent
is
a
requirement
that
leaves
no
deference
to
the
legislature
as
required
by
this
court
in
upham
and
in
white.
and,
if
there
is
to
be
any
deference
to
the
legislature
the
test
should
be,
take
a
look
at
the
plans
that
were
before
the
legislature
and
compare
those
to
the
plan
that
is
before
that
is
being
challenged
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
interest
was
adequately--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--no,
what
the
concern
was
here
was,
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
outset--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--did
they
include
compactness--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--in
my
discussions
with
them,
there
were
some
concerns,
but
that
concern
was
down
the
line.
there
were
some
people
who
did
mention
the
question
of
compactness,
but
as
i
said,
what
it
was
was
concern
about
the
preservation
of
municipal
boundaries,
core
constituencies,
fairness
to
minorities,
and
population
equality.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
might.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
what,
compactness?
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
oh,
democratic
majority
control?
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
there
was
some
concern
by
some
members
that
there
be
fairness
to
all
of
the
incumbents,
and,
in
fact,
there
were
discussions
with
one
of
the
republicans
who
was
very
concerned
about
his
vulnerability.
but,
there
also
was
some
concern
in
drafting
the
plan
about
preserving
some
of
the
seniority
of
democratic
members
of
the
legislature.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
after
listening
to
the
appellees'
argument,
i
am
a
bit
curious
whether
or
not
this
case
is
about
population
equality
or
whether
it
is
about
gerrymandering
or
some
sort
of
set
of
statutory
standards
about
compactness
or
what.
there
have
been
references
to
straight
lines
and
crooked
lines
in
the
arguments
of
the
appellees
that
i
would
like
to
just
address
the
court
to
page
17
of
the
joint
appendix
to
take
a
look
at
the
lines
that
mr.
reock's
map,
which
was
stressed
so
heavily,
has...
those
lines
may
not
be
schematic
as
these
lines,
but
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
maps
in
the
joint
appendix
you
will
see
crooked
lines
and
not
what
are
traditionally
compactness
that
you
may
find
in
other
states
because
of
the
nature
of
the
population
and
its
distribution.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
question
of
partisanship
that
has
been
maintained
here.
it
is
uncomparable
within
the
record...
i
think
it
is
at
the
appendix
on
page
83,
paragraph
8
of
mr.
karcher's
statement...
which
he
says
they
were
concerned
with
the
preservation
of
cores
of
preexisting
districts
where
practicable
and
the
discussions
in
a
november,
1981
meeting
included
discussions
of
various
interests
of
incumbent
congressmen
both
republican
and
democrat.
there
is
no
finding
in
the
district
court
below
that
there
was
partisan
gerrymandering
in
this
case.
and,
the
record
does
not
support
any
such
claim.
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
to
that
effect.
in
fact,
the
election
results
belie
any
suggestion.
all
incumbents
but
one
were
reelected
in
his
district.
and,
as
the
record
shows,
people
were
aware
that
the
one
seat
that
was
lost
could
be
attributed
to
millicent
fenwick
running
for
the
senate
so
that
none
of
the
incumbents
would
be
hurt.
everyone
knew
that
some
members
of
congress
would
move
because
the
district
lines
had
to
be
changed
because
they
wanted
to
be
closer
to
their
core
constituencies.
that
is
what
the
record
shows
about
partisan
gerrymandering,
which
is
allegedly
the
claim
of
bad
faith
in
this
case.
in
addition,
i
think
that
the
court
should
recognize
that
this
case
is
not
a
case
about
good
faith.
it
is
about
a
good
faith
effort
to
achieve
population
equality.
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
nowhere
shown
that
even
if
partisan
factors
were
at
play
here
that
they
had
any
connection
to
the
population
variations
that
exist
in
this
case.
and,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stressed,
most
recently
in
rogers
v.
lodge
and
mobile
v.
boulden
is
that
you
can
make
some
allegations
about...
you
can
make
allegations
about
certain
things,
but
you
sure
to
better
show
the
connection
between
that
and
the
harm
claimed.
and,
the
harm
in
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
j.
guido,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
and,
the
other
thing
is
there
are
probably
15
definitions
of
compactness
if
you
read
the
literature
on
reapportionment.
thank
you.
