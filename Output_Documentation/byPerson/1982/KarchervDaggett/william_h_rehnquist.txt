justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
guido,
what
does
that
0.7
of
one
percent
translate
into
in
terms
of
people?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
finding
by
the
district
court
that
it
did
or
did
not
credit
mr.
trussell...
dr.
trussell's
testimony?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
guido,
is
that
green
district
that
is
by
asbury
park
and
long
branch,
is
that
all
one
district?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
same
district
isn't
extended
up
to
the
light
green
north
of
the
body
of
water?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hellring,
how
would
you
define
gerrymandering
as
you
pronounce
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
might
call
number
four
a
running
back
district,
too,
i
guess.
[laughter]
but,
what
does
that
amount
to
for
purposes
of
our
cases.
our
cases
do
not
say
flatly
that
you
cannot
have
a
district
shaped
like
a
fishhook
or
like
a
running
back.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
gerrymandering
mean
that
the
district
has
been
drawn
for
ulterior
political
motives?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
factual?
