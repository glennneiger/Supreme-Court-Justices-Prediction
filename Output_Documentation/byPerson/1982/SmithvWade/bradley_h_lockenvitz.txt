mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
recklessness
implies
malice.
a
reckless
or
callous
disregard
of
constitutional
rights
under
color
of
law
resulting
in
physical
injury
justifies
an
award
of
punitive
damages
under
section
1983.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
i'm
asserting
that,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
the
availability
of
punitive
damages
in
cases
such
as
this
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
policy
of
deterrence
inherent
in
the
civil
rights
act.
the
standard
is
the
same
as
that
found
in
the
common
law
in
many
jurisdictions
in
this
country
at
the
time
this
act
was
initiated.
coincidentally
enough,
it
is
the
same
standard
required
to
find
liability
for
actual
damages
against
prison
officials
in
this
case.
i
have
found
four
states
where
the
common
law
of
punitive
damages
included
some
element
of
recklessness
or
gross
negligence
at
the
time
the
act
enacted,
the
states
of
wisconsin,
california,
alabama,
maine,
and
there
may
be
others
that
i
did
not
find.
but
a
consistent
theme
throughout
these
cases
is
one
where,
in
talking
of
malice
or
reckless
disregard,
the
courts
referred
to
it
in
the
disjunctive.
for
example,
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
but
i
am
saying
that
the
standard
that
was
given
to
the
jury--
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
--as
far
as--
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
--i
believe
malicious
intent
can
be
implied
by
a
callous
disregard
of
known
threats
to
health
and
safety,
as
this
court
said
in
estelle.
the
common
law
i
was
referring
to
refers
to
a
malicious
motive
or
a
reckless
disregard
in
several
cases.
i
might
add
that
the
milwaukee
case
of
this
united
states
supreme
court,
cited
by
the
petitioner,
of
1975,
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act,
referred
to
reckless
indifference,
and
again
it
was
in
the
disjunctive.
it
said
if
the
act
was
done
willfully
or
was
the
result
of
that
reckless
indifference
to
the
rights
of
others,
punitive
damages
would
be
awarded.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
it
is
my
position,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
--i
believe
we
have
shown
the
reckless--
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
--egregious
conduct,
reckless
disregard.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
i
believe
the
state
is
asking
for
us
to
bear
an
impossible
burden.
i
think
they're
asking
us
to
look
into
the
head
of
william
henry
smith
to
determine
what
he
really
wanted
to
do
in
this
case.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
that's
right.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
yes.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i'm
asking
this
court
not
to
initiate
a
new
standard,
but
to
maintain
what
i
argue
is
the
standard
that
has
been
here
all
along.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
i
say
it
is
authorized,
and
perhaps
i'm
not
making
myself
clear.
i
believe
the
state
is
asking
for
us
to
show
something
along
the
lines
of,
william
henry
smith
said,
danny
wade,
i'm
going
to
put
you
in
the
cell
so
you
can
be...
have
your
constitutional
rights
violated.
we
cannot
prove
that.
we
did
not
prove
that.
but
i
don't
see
that
as
any
different
from
an
example
that
you
brought
up
with
drunken
driving.
we
put
people
in
jail
in
missouri
all
the
time
for
reckless
disregard
when
driving
while
drunk,
or
manslaughter.
and
i
believe
that's
the
same
standard
that
you
apply
in
1983
cases
for
punitive
damages.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
for
manslaughter?
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
say,
your
honor,
but
the
number
is
substantial.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
to
my
knowledge,
this
is
the
only
one.
your
honors,
i
think
when
looking
at
the
standard
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
malice
there,
whether
or
not
there's
aggravating
circumstances...
when
i
speak
of
malice,
i'm
speaking
of
the
implied
malice
that
comes
with
the
careless
disregard...
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
risk.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
well,
your
honor,
i
just
go
back
to
the
common
law
cases
where
this
court
and
others
have
said
that
you
must
show
malice
or
reckless
disregard,
and
there
are
instances
where
reckless
disregard
leads
the
court
to
believe
that
there
was
malice
and
to
find
malice.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
yes,
your
honor.
but
this
is
an
extraordinary
case
in
that
the
standard
that
we
had
to
meet
to
reach
actual
damages
at
all,
because
of
the
qualified
immunity,
because
of
the
prison
officials
being
involved,
is
the
same
standard
as
that
required
in
the
common
law
for
punitive
damages.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
i
see
the
gist
of
your
statement,
your
honor.
however,
again
i
refer
back.
you're
talking
about
some
element
of
punishment
and
here
we're
really
talking
about
deterrence.
if
you
go
back
to
our
drunken
driving
cases
and
our
manslaughter
cases,
we
put
people
in
jail
for
those
same
standards
with
the
hope
that
they'll
be
deterred,
and
the
deterrence...
and
punished.
the
deterrence
and
punishment
policies
are
in
both
cases.
and
we
don't
have
to
prove
any
higher
standard
to
find
people
guilty
of
drunken
driving
or
manslaughter
in
missouri.
once
we
meet
that
burden
we've
got
it,
and
i
believe
the
same
thing
would
apply
here
in
this
extraordinary
case.
you
see,
your
honor,
i
don't
see
this
as
opening
the
floodgates
for
prison
litigation.
first
of
all,
because
as
i
mentioned
the
facts
are
extraordinary
in
the
case
in
that
we
were
able
to
meet
the
burden
at
all.
but
at
the
same
time,
punitive
damages
under
1983
are
limited
to
individuals.
there's
no
deep
pocket
there.
we
could
not
have
gotten
punitive
damages
against
a
municipality
under
city
of
newport.
there
is
a
good
question
about
whether
or
not
the
tort
defense
fund
will
cover
punitive
damages
in
this
case.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
yes,
for
ordinary
tort
liability
in
cases
of
this
nature,
is
the
way
i
read
that.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
there's
a
higher
standard
for
finding
the
basic
liability
to
get
compensatory
damages.
we
have
that
higher
standard
because
of
the
prison
official
being
involved.
we
can't
find...
a
court
cannot
find
a
prison
official
liable
on
mere
negligence.
we
had
to
reach
that
higher
standard,
the
standard
that
is
there
for
punitive
damages
in
this
case,
in
order
to
find
actual
damages
at
all.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
yes,
insofar
as
it
applies
to
cases
of
this
nature,
where
you
have
to
find
this
higher
standard.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
your
honor,
i
believe
the
protection
given
to
public
officials
and
in
this
case
prison
officials
with
the
qualified
immunity
is
adequate
with
the
standard
for
actual
damages.
they
are
protected.
they
are
allowed
to
make
these
discretionary
decisions
because
of
the
qualified
immunity.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
yes,
your
honor,
and
again,
perhaps
i'm
not
being...
perhaps
my
use
of
the
word
"malice"
is
not
appropriate
here.
i'm
talking
about
implied
malice
from
the
reckless
conduct.
i'm
not
talking
about
looking
into
the
man's
head
to
determine
what
he
intended
to
do.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
yes.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
okay.
i
say
that,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
by
coincidence
or
whatever
the
standard
we
must
reach
in
order
to
obtain
actual
damages
happens
to
be
the
same
standard
for
punitive
damages
under
the
common
law.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
yes,
your
honor,
exactly.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
no,
your
honor.
and
again,
i
think
when
you
look
at
this
to
determine
whether
or
not
punitive
damages
should
be
awarded,
you
must
look
at
the...
you
can't
eliminate
the
possibility
of...
you
can't
eliminate
the
theory
of
risk.
you
must
look
at
the
risk
involved.
for
example,
in
carey
the
risk
of
real
damages
to
these
students
in
carey
was
not
very
great.
they
were
going
to
leave
school
for
a
while,
but
there
was
no
risk,
for
example,
of
physical
injury
or
rape,
the
things
that
we
have
here.
in
this
case
you
have
a
situation
where
a
guard
with
plenty
of
objective
facts
behind
him
made
a
decision
with
deliberate
indifference,
callous
disregard,
of
what
was
known
to
him
about
these
individuals.
it
was
similar
or
could
be
compared
to
putting
two
hungry
lions
in
a
small
cage
with
a
lamb.
now,
if
the
man
turns
his
head
on
that
we
can't
really
say
that
he
intended
for
the
lions
to
eat
the
lamb,
but
by
merely
turning
his
head
with
these
facts
in
front
of
him
you
must
presume
that
he
deliberately
did
not
care
what
happened.
and
that
is
what
we
have
here.
i
think
what
we're
also
talking
about
is
what
one
of
the
colleagues
of
the
defendant
below
referred
to
as
a
common
sense
standard.
he
testified
that
it
was
just
common
sense
that
you
don't
place
special
treatment
unit
inmates
in
a
65
square
foot
cell
with
inmates
from
the
general
population.
just
common
sense.
we're
not
talking
about
a
higher
plane.
we're
not
asking
for
this
guard
to
review
all
of
the
constitutional
law
on
the
spot.
we're
asking
him
not
to
be
careless.
we're
asking
him
not
to
show
a
deliberate
disregard
for
the
health
and
safety
of
this
particulate
inmate.
your
honors,
to
overturn
the
decision
below
i
believe
this
court
would
in
effect
be
taking
away
the
admonition
function
of
punitive
damages.
and
i
want
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
a
hypothetical.
if
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
elijah
smith,
with
the
same
guard
on
duty
in
the
same
dormitory,
with
somewhat
similar
circumstances,
was
beaten
to
death
only
a
few
months
before
this
happened,
if
on
the
night
that
danny
wade
was
raped
d
beaten
he
would
have
been
killed,
his
actual
damages
under
missouri
law
or
the
actual
damages
for
his
family
would
have
been
very
small,
because
they
would
have
been
limited
to
what
he
could
have
provided
for
them
in
supports.
and
it's
unrealistic
to
suppose
an
18
year
old
in
prison
with
a
felony
record
is
going
to
provide
much
in
the
way
of
support
for
his
family
outside
the
prison.
but
without
actual
damages
there
would
be
no
real
deterrence
for
these
guards.
in
other
words,
there
comes
a
time...
or
i
mean,
substantial
actual
damages.
there
comes
a
time
when
actual
damages
can
be
so
low,
the
possibility
of
them
can
be
so
low,
that
a
guard
or
someone
else
in
that
position
may
decide
to
take
the
risk.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
cheaper
for
him
to
pay
the
actual
damages
and
violate
the
constitutional
rights
than
it
would
be
for
him
to
apply
some
new
policy
or
make
a
more
careful
decision,
or
in
this
case
place
danny
wade
in
a
cell
downstairs
with
only
one
other
inmate
who
is
from
the
special
treatment
unit
rather
than
in
a
cell
with
two
inmates
who
had
come
from
the
general
population.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
i
suppose
these
individuals
expect
that.
however,
i
agree
with
mr.
presson
that
there's
a
real
question
as
to
the
punitive
damage
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
no,
your
honor.
and
you
know,
it's
interesting
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
tort
defense
fund
was
available
was
brought
out
in
trial
in
a
remark
made
by
the
defense
counsel.
and
yet,
this
jury,
knowing
that
there's
some
type
of
insurance
back
there,
realized
the
role
of
punitive
damages
and
these
good
missouri
folks
decided
that
$5,000
was
adequate
to
punish
or
deter
this
guard
from
similar
conduct
in
the
future.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
the
court
would
have.
i
did
not...
well,
they
would
have
permitted
me
to
do
that
after
the
remark
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
prior
to
that,
no,
the
court
would
not
have.
your
honor...
your
honors,
ordinarily
actual
damages
would
be
enough.
but
with
the
hypothetical
that
i've
just
presented
to
you
and
the
deterrence
policy
that
we're
talking
about
here,
i
believe
in
1983
cases
the
door
should
be
left
open.
when
you
take
a
look
at
the
legislative
history...
and
again,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
there
is
no
indication
that...
damages
were
not
discussed
in
the
debates.
but
i
saw
time
and
time
again
in
the
debates
before
the
act
of
1871
and
its
predecessor
in
1866
the
problem
of
state
officials
turning
their
backs
on
the
rights
of
innocent
citizens.
and
it
is
my
belief
that
this
concern,
along
with
the
common
law
that
existed
at
the
time,
must
be
read
in
such
a
way
that
they
intended
for
punitive
damages
to
be
available.
and
again,
the
damages
were
not
actually
discussed,
at
least
where
i
could
find
it,
in
the
legislative
debates,
but
the
policy
of
deterrence
certainly
was,
and
the
policy
of
deterrence
in
civil
rights
actions,
of
course,
has
been
mentioned
by
this
court
time
and
time
again.
your
honors,
again
i
want
to
perhaps
clarify
something
and
distinguish
this
case
from
carey.
in
carey
the
plaintiff
had
to
show
that
he
was
deprived
of
a
right
under
color
of
law.
he
had
to
show
negligence,
that
they
knew
or
should
have
known
that
his
right
was
being
violated.
and
then
to
reach
punitive
damages,
because
he
had
no
actuals,
he
had
to
show
some
sort
of
actual
malice,
which
has
been
defined
as
ill
will,
spite
or
reckless
disregard.
here,
instead
of
a
three-step
process,
because
of
the
particular
qualified
immunity
for
prison
officials
we
had
to
show
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
but
because
of
the
qualified
immunity
we
had
to
show
that
this
deprivation
occurred
because
of
a
callous
indifference,
an
egregious
failure,
if
you
will,
a
deliberate
indifference
to
known
threats
to
health
and
safety,
recklessness.
in
other
words,
we
met
that
punitive
damage
standard
as
soon
as
we
met
the
standard
for
actual
damages.
and
then
we
showed
that
he
knew
or
should
have
known
that
these
rights
were
being
violated.
your
honors,
we're
talking
about
balancing
the
interests
here
in
this
particular
case
and
cases
like
it.
in
this
interest...
in
this
case,
what
can
be
more
important
to
this
prison
official
than
the
health
and
safety
of
danny
wade,
as
well
as
the
overall
atmosphere
in
this
prison
cell.
we're
not...
in
this
prison
dormitory.
we're
not
talking
about
balancing
the
interests
of
free
speech,
as
in
the
gertz
case.
we're
not
talking
about
reaching
into
the
deep
pockets
of
innocent
taxpayers
by
going
against
the
state
or
municipality.
we're
not
talking
about
going
into
the
deep
pockets
of
the
labor
union--
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
--the
tort
defense
fund
is
here,
mr.
justice,
because
the
state
chose
to
impose
that
burden
on
itself.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
practically
speaking,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
fund
is
a
nullity.
it
is
not
there.
the
legislature
must
appropriate
the
money
each
time
a
judgment
is
paid.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
from
the
taxpayers.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
but
again,
i
must
point
out
that
the
state
imposed
this
burden
on
itself.
it
didn't
have
to.
it's
there
because
of
a
statute,
not
because
they
are
required
by
the
constitutional
law
to
pay
these
judgments.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
the
honorable
scott
wright.
your
honors,
the
policy
of
deterrence
must
be
maintained
with
punitive
damages,
must
be
maintained
with
punitive
damages
in
cases
such
as
this,
because
to
deprive
danny
wade
and
others
like
him
of
punitive
damages
leaves
the
door
open
for
prison
guards
and
other
prison
officials
to
take
the
easy
way
out,
and
if
the
actual
damages
happen
to
be
low...
obviously,
they
can't
be
zero,
but
if
they
happen
to
be
low...
they
may
choose
to
take
the
easy
way
out
and
pay
rather
than
face
the
possibility
of
deterrence.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
in
part,
your
honor.
the
trial
judge
surprised
both
counsel
in
applying
the
missouri-approved
instructions
in
this
case.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
the
missouri
state
court.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
both
for
the
verdict
direct...
well,
he
modified
them,
obviously.
mr.
bradley
h.
lockenvitz
instruction
5
is...
not
verbatim,
obviously,
but
he
turned
to
the
mai,
the
missouri
approved
instructions,
for
his
guide
and
modified
it
according
to
federal
law,
rather
than
using
the
federal
law
form
books
that
counsel
had
been
accustomed
to
using.
i
might
add,
though,
that
he
did
not,
as
you
can
see
in
instruction
5
on
page
13
of
the
appendix,
he
did
not
leave
the
definitions
of
such
things
as
gross
negligence
and
egregious
failure
to
the
imagination
of
the
jury.
he
defined
them,
i
believe,
with
the
appropriate
federal
standard.
the
same
way
with
instruction
number
7,
which
appears
on
page
14,
which
is
the
punitive
damage
instruction,
where
he
refers
to
a
callous
or
reckless
disregard
or
indifference
to
the
rights
and
safety
of
others.
thank
you.
