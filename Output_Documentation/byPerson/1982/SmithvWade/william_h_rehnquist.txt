rehnquist
didn't
the
philadelphia,
wilmington
and
baltimore
railroad
case,
which
had
been
decided
by
this
court
in
1858,
talk
about
punitive
damages
in
terms
that
the
injury
complained
of
has
been
inflicted
maliciously
or
wantonly?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lockenvitz,
you
may
not
have
had
occasion
to
look
at
our
case
of
sandstrom
versus
montana,
where...
which
is
of
course
in
a
quite
different
field.
there's
no
reason
why
you
should
have.
but
i
think
that
case
goes
into
the
problems
of
telling
a
factfinder
that
he
can
find
intent
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
presumption
that
everybody
intended
the
normal
consequences
of
their
acts
and
that
sort
of
thing.
you
used
the
term
"implied
malice"
just
now.
could
you
elaborate
on
how
you
would
define
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
common
law
cases
from
this
court
or
elsewhere
generally
require
a
higher
standard
for
recovery
of
punitive
damages
than
they
do
for
the
recovery
for
the
tort
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
have
to
reach
a
higher
standard
to
impose
liability
at
all
and
the
common
law
cases
suggest
that
there
should
be
a
difference
in
standards
for
actual
and
punitive
damages,
wouldn't
it
make
sense
here
to
say
that
you
should
have
had
to
prove
a
still
higher
standard
to
get
punitive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
correct,
counsel,
then
the
imposition
of
a
higher
standard
in
some
torts,
such
as
the
one
you
are
involved
in
here,
some
constitutional
tort,
offers
somewhat
minimal
protection
to
the
defendants,
because
if
that
higher
standard
is
once
met
you
can
recover,
a
plaintiff
can
recover,
not
only
actual
damages
but
punitive
damages
against
them,
whereas
if
a
lower
standard
is
required
presumably
under
your
reasoning
actual
damages
could
be
recovered,
but
not
punitive
damages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
where
do
you
suppose
this
tort
defense
fund
comes
from?
the
taxpayers.
