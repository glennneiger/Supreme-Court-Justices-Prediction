justice
harry
a.
blackmun
could
i
ask
you
a
question,
counsel,
due
to
the
remark
you
just
dropped.
i
thought
i
read
chief
judge
lay's
opinion
for
the
majority
below
as
saying
that
the
standard
for
punitive
damages
equates
with
that
for
ordinary
tort
liability.
did
you
read
it
that
way?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
thought
in
one
of
your
responses
to
justice
rehnquist
you
rather
conceded
that
maybe
there
is
a
higher
standard
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
you
are
in
agreement
with
chief
judge
lay's
remark?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
i
wonder
why
you
make
this
concession.
even
without
making
the
concession,
you
still
would
take
the
position
that
you
should
prevail
here?
