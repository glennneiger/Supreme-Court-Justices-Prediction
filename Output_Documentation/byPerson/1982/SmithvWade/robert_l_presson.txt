mr.
robert
l.
presson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
on
the
basis
of
an
allegation
by
the
plaintiff
to
his
rights
under
the
eighth
amendment,
made
applicable
through
the
fourteenth,
to
be
free
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
this
case
then
presents
the
issue
of
what
is
the
proper
standard
for
the
award
of
punitive
damages
in
an
action
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
last
year
in
the
case
of
city
of
newport
versus
fact
concerts,
incorporated,
this
court
stated
that
in
a
proper
case
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
punitive
damages
were
available.
the
question
now
is
what
is
a
proper
case.
this
had
not
been
reached
before
because
in
the
newport
case
it
was
found
that
municipalities
were
actually
immune.
although
the
issue
was
not
directly
reached
and
did
not
have
to
be
reached,
there
was
a
very
strong
indication
by
this
court
as
to
what
the
appropriate
standard
for
punitive
damages
was.
in
the
course
of
the
opinion
in
that
case
this
court
stated
that
a
public
official
who
knowingly
and
maliciously
acts
to
deprive
one
of
his
civil
rights
is
a
proper
subject
for
punitive
damages.
this
in
turn
echoes
what
this
court
had
said
in
the
earlier
opinion,
about
three
years
earlier,
in
carey
versus
piphus.
again,
it
was
dicta.
the
issue
of
punitive
damages
was
not
strictly
speaking
before
the
court.
the
court
did
state
that
punitive
damages
would
not
have
been
an
appropriate
award
under
the
circumstances
in
carey
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
malicious
intent
to
deprive
of
rights
or
to
do
injury.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i'm
not
aware
of
anything
in
particular
in
the
legislative
history
about
punitive
damages,
and
in
fact
i
believe
this
court
stated,
i
believe,
in
the
carey
case
that
congress
in
enacting
1983
had
never
really
discussed
the
issue
of
damages
much
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
believe
they
were
available,
yes,
as
early
as
1851.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
not
in
all
tort
cases,
no,
your
honor.
again,
i
still
think--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
i
think
again
it
becomes
the
standard
to
be
applied,
whether
the
facts
of
any
particular
case--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--in
some
jurisdictions
there
may
have
been.
i'm
not
aware.
mostly
i
believe
it
was
terms
in
phrased...
phrased
in
terms,
excuse
me...
of
a
reckless
disregard.
this
is
what
this
court
has
stated,
i
believe,
100
years
ago
in
the
st.
paul
case.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i'm
not
specifically
familiar
with
that
particular
case.
the
milwaukee
and
st.
paul
case
cited
in
the
brief
indicates
a
reckless
disregard
or
whatever
that
is
the
equivalent
of
malicious
intent,
is
the
way
this
court
phrased
it
at
that
time.
that
case
i
believe
was
rendered
in
1875.
so
about
that
same
time
i
believe
that's
the
indication
this
court
had
given
as
to
what
the
appropriate
standard
was.
i
think,
though,
that
whatever
it
might
have
been
immediately
preceding
the
enactment
of
1983
or
perhaps
even
for
the
short
time
thereafter,
it
is
not
necessarily
a
static
consideration.
because
there
is
so
very
little,
in
fact
nothing
much,
said
about
the
issue
of
damages
pertaining
to
1983,
i
think
it
is
a
rather
fluid
concept,
and
this
court--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
in
the
milwaukee
and
st.
paul
railway
case
this
court
rejected
what
had
evidently
earlier
been
the
appropriate
standard
of
gross
negligence
as
the
standard,
and
said
attempts
to
adequately
define
gross
negligence
have
been
ineffective,
that
is
no
longer
the
proper
standard,
and
redefined
the
standard
in
terms
of
reckless
conduct,
which
this
court
said
is
of
such
a
degree
that
it
is
the
equivalent
of
a
malicious
intent.
so
in
that
sense,
as
early
as
1875
there
was
an
attempt
to
redefine
what
an
appropriate
case
for
punitive
damages
was.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
that
was
not
specifically
a
1983
case,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--it
would
be
a
possibility,
depending
again
upon--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--whatever
the
state
standards
for
punitive
damages
were.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
for
state
cases?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
in
state
personal
injury
cases?
i
would
say
that
if
i
were
standing
before
the
missouri
supreme
court
today
i'd
be
arguing
essentially
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
the
basic
standard
is
one
of
recklessness,
your
honor.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
instruction
which
was
actually
given
in
this
case,
that
pretty
much
is
the
missouri-approved
form
instruction.
that
was
what
the
judge
wanted
to
give,
so
he
pulled
out
the
mai
form
book
and
used
that.
so
that
is
the
standard
in
missouri.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
right.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
i
think
particularly
in
this
situation,
the
role
of
the
correctional
officer
or
any
state
official,
who
are
the
ones
that
are
being
subject
to
1983...
the
qualified
immunity
which
this
court
has
recognized
i
think
would
be
undermined
by
application
of
any
lesser
standard.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
it
affords
a
substantial
protection.
what
it
was
designed
to
do,
i
believe,
was
to
afford
the
protection
from
compensatory
damages.
but
it
would
appear
to
me
that
if
on
the
basis
of
that
same
standard
you're
going
to
allow
virtually
unlimited
punitive
damages,
then
you
are
essentially
undermining
the
protection
which
has
been
afforded
by
the
qualified
immunity
to
begin
with.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
other
contexts,
punitive
damages
are
essentially
unreviewable.
jury
discretion
is
virtually
unlimited.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
that
is
a
possibility.
but
as
this
court
i
believe
stated
in
either
the
foust
or
the
gertz
case,
this
is
limited
by
only,
to
quote
the
court,
"the
gentle
rule
that
it
not
be
excessive.
"
essentially
i
think,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
on
numerous
occasions,
they
are
virtually
unlimited
and
courts
appear
to
be
very
reluctant
to
interfere
with
the
jury
discretion.
i
know
of
a
recent
case
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
again
the
court
indicating
that
it
would
probably
not
have
made
the
same
determination
on
the
appropriateness
of
punitive
damages
in
that
case,
but
again
on
the
other
hand
they
didn't
think
it
was
an
appropriate
case
for
them
to
interfere
with
the
jury's
discretion
in
that
regard.
i
believe
the
question
of
the
appropriate
standard...
quite
apart
from
the
court's
previous
indications
in
carey
and
newport,
i
believe
the
rationale
behind
punitive
damages
can
only
be
served
by
a
more
explicit
standard,
and
that
explicit
standard
i
believe
was
best
defined
as
what
this
court
has
indicated
in
terms
of
actual
malice.
the
primary
purpose
as
i
see
it
of
1983
is
not
particularly
punishment,
as
this
court
noted
in--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
in
terms
of
what
this
court
has
said
in
carey
and
newport:
a
malicious
intent
to
deprive
one
of
one's
civil
rights
or
to
do
specific
injury
to
that
individual.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
as
i
read
what
this
court
said
in
those
cases,
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
don't
believe
it
could
be
passive.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
no,
not
as
the
standard,
because
recklessness...
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
sense
of
qualified
immunity
that
one
knew
or
should
have
known
that
your
actions
were
going
to
deprive
someone
of
his
constitutional
rights.
and
although
in
the
context
of
that
the
court
has
never
specifically
used
the
term
"reckless"
that
i'm
aware
of,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
knew
or
should
have
known,
that
approaches
being
reckless
if
it
isn't
in
fact.
i
think
the
court
then...
the
basic
standard
of
liability
is
a
reckless
standard,
and
it
was
established
at
that
level
for
a
very
particular
reason.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
enough
to
say,
well,
the
level
is
already
high,
you
don't
need
to
go
any
higher
for
punitive
damages,
because
i
think
the
level
has
been
set
high
for
a
very
specific
reason,
that
reason
being
that
for
state
officials
who
do
exercise
discretion
and
who
are
therefore
entitled
to
the
protection
of
qualified
immunity,
that
the
dangers
of
not
acting
or
being
inhibited
in
their
actions
can
often
be
as
great
or
greater
than
their
actions
themselves.
the
court
pointed
out
the
dangers
of
punitive
damages
and
their
excessiveness
and
unpredictability
in
the
foust
and
gertz
cases
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
in
those
cases,
the
court
indicated
that
even
if
confident
that
punitive
damages
may
not
be
available,
that
say
the
labor
union
in
the
foust
case
could
still
feel
compelled
to
pass
up
fair
settlement
offers
or
to
pursue
frivolous
claims,
actions
which
this
court
described
as
not
being
in
the
best
interests
of
the
union
members.
similarly
for
state
officials,
their
actions
often
affect
many
other
people
other
than
the
plaintiff
who
eventually
sues
them
in
a
1983
action.
in
particular
here,
the
defendant
was
responsible
not
just
for
the
safety
of
the
plaintiff;
he
was
responsible
for
the
safety
of
anywhere
from
110
to
120
inmates
in
that
particular
unit.
and
the
decision
he
makes
at
any
particular
time
regarding
any
one
of
them
can
affect
the
safety
and
well-being
of
all
of
them,
and
i
think
he
needs
to
have
the
protection
afforded
by
the
qualified
immunity
to
make
that
informed
discretion
decision
without,
as
this
court
has
said,
undue
timidity.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
to
the
punitive
damage,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
believe
that
as
far
as
furthering
what
this
court
has
indicated
was
the
primary
purpose
of
1983
apart
from
compensation,
and
that
being
deterrence,
it
is
best
served
by
an
explicit
standard,
as
explicit
as
is
humanly
possible.
because
if
one
cannot
predict
what
is
being
prohibited
or
one
does
not
know
what
is
being
prohibited,
then
it
is
very
unlikely
that
one
could
be
deterred.
or
if
one
does
happen
to
avoid
what
is
subsequently
construed
to
be
prohibited,
then
it
is
sheer
happenstance,
rather
than
the
exercise
of
an
informed
decisionmaking.
on
the
other
hand,
to
raise
the
level
of
punitive
damages
in
this
case,
to
make
it
more
explicit,
and
i
believe
in
fact
to
enhance
the
deterrence
rationale
of
1983,
does
not
really
do
any
damage
to
that
deterrence
rationale.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
it
can
deter
only
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
common
principle
such
that
you
know
what--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--that
is
not
always
in
practice
that
easy
a
determination
to
make,
particularly--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--true.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
again
i
get
back
to
the
reason
for
punitive
damages,
and
that
is
in
my
mind
primarily
deterrence.
the
process
of
getting
from
a
particular
judgment
to
deterring
in
the
future
is
an
inductive
process.
in
other
words,
from
one
specific
instance
try
to
reach
a
general
proposition.
and
i
think
by
examining
the
cases
which
have
dealt
with
eight
amendment
issues
in
terms
of
failure
to
protect
you
can
come
up
with
common
language,
but
very
few
what
i
would
call
common
principles
such
that
you
could
predict
what
the
result
would
be
with
any
reasonable
degree
of
certainty.
some
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
plaintiff
in
his
brief
indicate
the
inconsistencies
which
abound
in
this
field.
one
of
the
cases,
schaal
versus
rowe,
indicated
that
if
you
turn
down
a
request
for
a
transfer
specifically
when
the
inmate
identified
why
he
wanted
to
be
transferred,
and
that
was
that
he
had
been
threatened,
they
decided
it
is
not
an
appropriate
case
for
a
transfer
and
he
subsequently
then
is
assaulted,
that
that
didn't
even
present
a
case
for
liability.
they
said
they
were
not
indifferent.
perhaps
they
made
the
wrong
decision,
perhaps
they
made
a
negligent
decision.
but
that
wasn't
even
a
case
appropriate
for
liability,
much
less
punitive
damages.
and
as
i
view
it,
we
really
have
nothing
too
much
more
than
that.
i
think
this
was
a
marginal
case
as
far
as
a
reckless
standard
to
begin
with.
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
cases...
and
some
of
them
cited
in
the
briefs
do
involve
decisions
of
correctional
officers
and
officials
dealing
with
custody
status
or
transfers
of
inmates,
which
is
essentially
what
we
have
here...
that
quite
often
you
are
presented
with,
in
the
words
of
one
court,
alternative
eighth
amendment
claims.
in
other
words,
someone
makes
a
threat,
the
person
against
whom
it
is
made
comes
to
complain.
so
what
do
you
do?
do
you
put
him
in
protective
status
on
the
basis
of
the
mere
threat?
do
you
lock
up
the
person
who
made
it?
it
is
a
difficult
decision,
and
while
in
hindsight
a
court
and
a
jury
might
say,
well,
you
were
reckless
in
that,
i
don't
think
that
provides
much
guidance
in
the
way
of
deterrence
to
the
officers
and
officials
who
have
to
make
that
decision
on
a
day
to
day
basis.
and
as
i
say,
they
don't
have...
they
have
to
deal
with
it
in
terms
of
many
situations
and
not
simply
one.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
no,
i
did
not
do
such
a
compilation.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
as
far
as
1983,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
until
this
one,
although
i
suppose
there
could
have
been
some
actions
against
municipalities
or
other
governmental
units
that
i
might
not
be
aware
of.
i
think
the
need
for
a
more
explicit
standard
is
not
only
to
enhance
the
deterrence
aspect
of
1983,
but
it
is
even
more
important
to
limit
what
this
court
has
indicated
is
the
possible
abuse
of
punitive
damages,
which
as
this
court
has
indicated
are
not
designed
to
compensate
for
any
actual
injury.
they
are
intended
as
a
quasi-criminal
fine
of
sorts
and
are
often
subject
to
abuse.
this
court
has
indicated
that
they
are
subject
to
being
used
against
unpopular
views
or
against
unpopular
defendants.
unfortunately,
in
this
day
and
age
perhaps
state
defendants
are
unpopular.
but
i
think
the
court
has
indicated
that
they
are
subject
to
severe
abuse,
and
i
think
in
a
way
a
higher
standard
of
conduct,
one
more
readily
understandable,
i
think,
and
perhaps
more
consistently
understandable,
might
eliminate
or
at
least
reduce
the
possibility
for
abuse.
an
alternative
argument
is
that
if
1983
in
all
instances
does
not
require
an
actual
malice
showing,
i
think
it
does
in
this
instance,
simply
because
as
a
general
procedural
or
philosophical
matter
the
courts
always
talk
in
terms
of
punitive
damages
being
available
for
aggravating
circumstances.
i
think
the
very
use
of
the
term
"aggravating"
implies
a
comparative
analysis,
two
different
levels
of
conduct,
one
being
higher
than
the
other.
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
level
of
conduct
in
this
case
and
applied
as
it
is
by
qualified
immunity
was
placed
there
for
a
very
specific
societal
reason,
and
it
was
placed
there
because
often
the
risks
of
not
doing
something
are
just
as
great
as
actually
acting,
and
that
the
risk
of
error
under
those
circumstances
deserves
some
protection
in
making
an
informed
decision.
i
think
it
would
undermine
that
policy
if
anything
less
than
actual
malice
were
to
be
implied.
i
also
believe
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
carey.
in
carey
this
court
indicated
that
you
could
not
presume
damages,
even
assuming
proof
of
a
constitutional
violation.
that
being
true,
it
seems
to
me
we
would
simply
be
reaching
the
same
result
here
by
simply
saying,
well,
they're
punitive
damages
and
not
presumed
damages.
but
in
either
instance,
plaintiff
is
saying
they
should
both...
or
the
punitive
damages
should
be
on
the
same
level
or
the
same
standard
of
liability
as
the
actual
damages.
and
yet,
presumed
damages
or
punitive
damages
is
neither
one
tied
to
the
theory
of
compensation
or
to
the
extent
of
any
actual
injury.
it
would
seem
to
be
that
to
award
punitive
damages
on
the
same
standard
of
conduct
as
that
for
the
basic
liability
gets
around
and
reaches
the
same
result
which
was
closed
off
in
this
court's
opinion
in
carey.
i
believe,
therefore,
that
both
the
policy
of
deterrence
would
neither
be
inhibited...
because
compensatory
and
the
threat
of
attorney's
fees
in
themselves
carry
with
it
a
deterrent
effect,
as
this
court
has
noted
on
previous
occasions.
to
the
extent
that
any
further
deterrence
is
appropriate
under
1983,
i
think
it
is
best
served
by
as
explicit
a
standard
as
possible,
and
i
say
that
because,
unlike
either
the
attorney's
fees
or
the
compensatory
damages,
which
are
inherently
limited
by
actual
costs
or
actual
damages,
as
this
court
has
noted
on
many
occasions,
punitive
damages
have
no
such
inherent
restriction
and
are
essentially
unlimited.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
that's
a
good
question,
your
honor.
certainly
insofar
as
the
actual
damages
are
concerned,
i
think
it
would
clearly
be
the
state
under
the
tort
defense
fund.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
missouri
has
established
what
it
calls
the
tort
defense
fund
for
certain
state
officers
and
officials.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
if
he
was
one
of
the
named
parties
covered
by
the
tort
defense
fund,
even
named
individually,
i
think
he
would
be
covered.
the
question
becomes--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
that's
what
i
said
was
a
good
question.
it's
never
really
been
decided
because
as
far
as
i
know
this
was
the
first
punitive
damage
award
against
the
state.
what
it
says
in
its
own
terms
is
that
it
will
pay
a
judgment
rendered
against
certain
specified
officers.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
not
in
this
instance,
no,
no.
but
the
way
the
statute
reads,
it
says
out
of
the
tort
defense
fund
you'll
pay
judgments
rendered
against
various
officials.
included
among
them
are
employees
of
the
department
of
corrections,
as
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
in
some
instances
yes,
but
it's
my
opinion
not
specifically
for
these.
in
other
words,
for
instance,
wardens
and
superintendents
are
required
to
have
bonds.
generally
they
have
a
blanket
sort
of
bond.
but
what
that
generally
covers
is
use
or
misuse
of
state
property
and
damages
actually
suffered
by
the
state
for
which
the
person
bonded
was
being
covered.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
it's
sort
of...
it's
not
an
insurance
policy
as
i
view
it.
the
only
protection
they
really
have
insofar
as
suits
of
this
nature
would
be
the
tort
defense
fund,
and
as
to
that
i
can't
give
you
a
definite
answer
as
to
whether
it
would
cover
punitives.
but
it
might
very
well.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
it
could
go
to
the
supreme
court.
there
are
two
officials
that
have
roles
in
the
administration
of
the
tort
defense
fund,
the
attorney
general
and
the
commissioner
of
administration.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
we
are
involved
in
it.
i
think
ultimately
we
make
recommendations,
as
i
understand
it,
but
the
commissioner
of
administration,
as
i
remember
the
wording
of
the
statute,
has
discretion
on
paying
a
judgment.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
it
would
have
some
weight,
although
state
officers
are
not
specifically
required
to
follow
opinions
issued
by
our
office.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
yes,
and
it
was
in
this
instance
as
well.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
i
suppose
it
arose
primarily
to
begin
with
as
a
matter
of
practice
and
policy.
now
specifically
under
the
tort
defense
fund
we
have
a
role
in
investigating
and
making
recommendations
even
as
far
as
settlement.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
it's
the
state
attorney
general's
office.
i
think
both
as
a
matter
of
common
understanding
and
practice
as
well
as
what
our
role
is
delineated
in
the
tort
defense
fund
statute,
we
undertake
generally
to
represent
state
defendants,
although
in
certain
instances
perhaps
involving
conflicts
of
interest
we
have
not
done
that.
but
as
a
general
rule
we
do.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
just
a
couple
of
comments,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
thank
you.
the
respondent
has
gotten
a
little
bit
into
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
i
don't
want
to
dwell
on
them
too
much,
but
i
do
feel
that
a
brief
response
on
my
part
would
be
appropriate.
first
of
all,
the
respondent's
characterization
of
placing
a
lamb
in
with
two
lions,
his
reference
to
what
one
guard
called
a
common
sense
rule
about
not
putting
a
protective
custody
inmate
in
with
those
from
general
population,
are
not
the
sole...
are
not
the
complete
picture
in
this
case.
the
plaintiff
was
in
the
administrative
segregation
unit
because
of
conduct
violations
in
the
protective
custody
unit
to
begin
with.
in
other
words,
once
he
had
requested
to
get
into
protective
custody
he
was
then
charged
himself
with
harassing
and
threatening
inmates
in
that
unit,
and
that
was
the
disciplinary
charge
that
got
him
into
administrative
segregation.
as
far
as
the
death
of
the
other
inmate
a
few
months
previous,
on
which
this
same
guard
did
happen
to
be
on
duty
at
the
time,
again
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
was
a
result
of
any
personal
fault
of
that
guard.
it
took
place
at
a
time
when
there
were
only
two
inmates
in
the
cell.
it
took
place
during
shower
period,
when
there
were
two
guards
but
both
of
them
happened
to
be
supervising
the
inmates
during
their
shower
period
because
the
inmates
were
obviously
out
of
the
cell
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
indication
that
this
had
any
rational
connection
between
the
later
events
involving
the
plaintiff
here.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
plaintiff's
then
argument
that
low
damages
would
encourage
someone
to
take
a
chance
is
really
unsupportable.
in
robertson
versus
wegmann
this
court
dealt
with
a
louisiana
statute
on
survivorship
under
which
certain
actions
might
abate,
and
the
argument
was
made,
well,
this
would
undermine
deterrence.
in
other
words,
they
could
say,
well,
this
might
abate,
i'll
take
the
chance.
this
court
rejected
that
as
an
unlikely
possibility
and
i
think
it's
equally
unlikely
that
a
state
official
would
sit
around
and
say,
well,
i
consider
damages
unlikely
here
in
any
great
amount,
i'll
take
a
chance.
that
is
just
too
iffy
a
proposition
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
can
indulge
the
assumption
that
that
would
happen.
it
appears
to
me
in
the
final
analysis
that
what
we
want
to
ensure
is
a
most
appropriate
imposition
of
punitive
damages,
and
i
think
a
higher
standard
is
conducive
with
that.
and
i
think
it
is
analogous
to
what
this
court
said
in
santosky
versus
kramer,
that
a
higher
standard
of
proof
ensures
or
places
the
fact-finder
on
notice
that
this
is
an
important
decision
and
helps
to
limit
the
possibility
of
an
inappropriate
decision.
for
that
reason
i
believe
an
actual
malice
standard
is
necessary.
