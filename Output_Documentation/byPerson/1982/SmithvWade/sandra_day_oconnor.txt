justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
presson,
what
have
you
been
able
to
discover
in
the
way
of
legislative
history
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
section
1983
that
would
indicate
congress
was
concerned
about,
if
it
so
indicated,
about
damages,
and
if
you
didn't
find
anything
specifically
in
the
legislative
history,
what
was
the
law
generally
at
that
time
as
far
as
punitive
damages
were
concerned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
agree
that
punitive
damages
were
generally
awarded
in
tort
cases
at
that
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
doesn't
the
trial
judge
normally
have
jurisdiction
to
reduce
the
amount
of
punitive
damages
if
the
judge
determines
it's
appropriate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
presson,
do
you
have
any
statistics
gathered
as
to
how
many
1983
actions
which
have
resulted
in
plaintiff's
verdicts
have
also
included
punitive
damages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
how
often
it's
happened
in
your
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
judgment
wasn't
against
the
state,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
provides
the
legal
defense
in
the
lawsuit?
is
that
provided
by
your
office?
