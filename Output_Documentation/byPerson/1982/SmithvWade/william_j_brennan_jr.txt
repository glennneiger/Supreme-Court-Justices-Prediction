justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
all
tort
cases
were
they
available
at
common
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
a
minority
or
a
majority
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
burden
to
show
intent,
for
example,
as
a
predicate
for
punitive
damages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
"fluid
concept"?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
1983
purposes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
the
standard
should
be
any
stricter
in
1983
cases
than
in
other
types,
tort
cases
for
example?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
should
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
an
ordinary
tort
suit
against
a
drunken
driver
who
strikes
you
in
the
street.
do
you
suppose
you
could
get
punitive
damages
in
such
a
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
what
standard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
what
do
you
think
it
ought
to
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think
it
ought
to
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
the
kind
of
case
i've
given
you,
the
hypothetical
i've
given
you.
should
it
be
recklessness,
intentional,
malice,
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
has
to
be
malicious
intent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
you
would
apply
that
standard
to
1983
and
to
torts
generally,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actual
malice,
define
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actual
malice;
how
do
you
define
actual
malice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought,
mr.
presson,
that
the
old
notion
of
punitive
damages
was
that
punitive
damages
were
smart
money.
in
other
words,
a
punishment
for
the
offender
by
requiring
him
to
pay
this
extra
amount
in
order
that
he
be
deterred
from
doing
that
again
in
the
future.
now,
1983
suits,
at
least
this
one
i
gather
is
one
for
constitutional
rights,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
one
has
been
guilty
of
denying
someone
his
constitutional
rights,
wouldn't
it
deter
future
constitutional
violations
if
he
had
to
pay
some
smart
money?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
common
principle
i'm
suggesting
is,
he
violated
the
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
it's
easy
or
not,
we
start
with
the
premise
that
there's
been
the
violation,
he's
had
a
verdict
in
a
1983
suit
because
he's
been
denied
his
constitutional
rights.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
well,
why
in
that
situation
should
not
he
then
be
subject
to
the
payment
of
smart
money
in
the
form
of
punitive
damages?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me.
are
you
conceding,
then,
that
at
least
to
the
extent
of
recklessness
and
callous
disregard,
there
is
that
much
has
to
be
proved
before
there
may
be
an
award
of
punitive
damages
in
a
1983
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
that
falls
short,
does
it,
of
actual
intent,
malicious
intent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
callous
disregard...
how
different
is
that
from
malicious
intent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
quite
clear
how
much
of
an
issue
we
have,
in
light
of
your
concession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
differ
from
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think
is
the
standard
that
you
have
to
satisfy
in
order
to
get
a
punitive
damage
award?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
i'm
asking
you,
how
does
that
differ
from
what
the
state's
insisted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
plaintiff
in
a
suit
brought
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983
may
recover
punitive
damages
as
well
as
compensatory
damages.
the
respondent,
while
an
inmate
in
a
missouri
reformatory
for
youthful
first
offenders,
was
harassed,
beaten,
and
sexually
assaulted
by
his
cellmates.
and
he
brought
suit
under
section
1983
in
federal
district
court
against
the
petitioner,
a
guard
at
the
reformatory,
and
other
officers,
alleging
that
they
had
violated
his
eighth
amendment
rights.
and
the
trial
judge,
charged
the
jury
that
it
could
award
punitive
damages
in
addition
to
actual
damages
if
the
petitioner's
conduct
was
shown
to
be
a
reckless
or
callous
disregard
of,
or
indifference
to,
the
rights
or
safety
of
others.
and
the
district
court
entered
judgment
on
a
verdict
brought
in
by
the
jury
finding
the
petitioner
liable
and
awarding
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
and
we
in
turn,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
punitive
damages
are
available
in
a
proper
case
under
section
1983.
while
there
is
little
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
1
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
from
which
section
1983
is
derived
concerning
the
damages
recoverable
for
the
tort
liability
created
by
the
statute,
the
availability
of
punitive
damages
was
accepted
as
settled
law
by
nearly
all
state
and
federal
courts
at
the
time
of
enactment.
moreover,
this
court
has
rested
decisions
on
related
issues
on
the
premise
that
punitive
damages
are
available
under
section
1983.
the
next
question
however
is
when
the
jury
may
award
punitive
damages.
and
we
hold
with
the
lower
courts
that
a
jury
may
be
permitted
to
assess
punitive
damages
in
a
1983
action
when
the
defendant's
conduct
involves
reckless
or
callous
indifference
to
the
plaintiff's
federally
protected
rights,
as
well
as
when
that
conduct
is
motivated
by
evil
motive
or
intent.
the
common
law,
both
in
1871
and
today,
allows
recovery
of
punitive
damages
in
tort
cases
not
only
for
actual
malicious
intent,
but
for
reckless
also
--
for
reckless
indifference
to
the
rights
of
others.
and
neither
the
policies
nor
the
purposes
of
section
1983
require
a
departure
from
the
common-law
rule.
the
petitioner's
contention
that
an
actual-intent
standard
is
preferable
is
just
not
that
persuasive.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
powell
have
joined.
and
justice
o'connor
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
