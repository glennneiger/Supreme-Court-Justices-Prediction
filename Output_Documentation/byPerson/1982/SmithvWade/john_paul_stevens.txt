mr.
presson,
may
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second.
you
mentioned
earlier
that
the
instruction
was
much
like
the
missouri
instruction,
the
instruction
generally
used
in
missouri
in
a
tort
case.
was
there
an
objection
made
to
the
instruction
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
there
was.
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
will
decide
whether
it
does?
who
will
decide
whether
it
covers
it?
i'm
sure
the
gentleman
will
make
the
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
your
office
has
a
voice
in
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
state
attorney
general
should
construe
the
statute
as
requiring
the
reimbursement
in
this
situation,
at
least
that
opinion
would
have
some
weight,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true,
you
only
make
that
concession
in
eighth
amendment
cases?
it's
a
deliberate
indifference
standard
that
you
say
is
the
same
as
the
reckless
disregard
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn't
necessarily
make
the
same
claim
if
it
was
an
improperly
executed
search
warrant
or
something
like
that?
