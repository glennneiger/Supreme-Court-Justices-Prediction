they
had
no
guarantee
they
would
be
paid
when
this
person
was
dumped
at
their
door,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
still
took
him.
justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
zaleznik,
are
we
in
a
position
to
impose
our
rules
as
to
standing
on
the
highest
court
of
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
footnote
is
it
that
you
rely
on
for
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
they
also
say
in
that
footnote
that
there
was
no
standing
question
raised
or
argued
in
the
briefs
and
they
deem
it
waived.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
point
contends,
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
broad,
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
didn't
do
that.
by
citing
barrows
against
jackson,
they
simply
followed
or
intended
to
follow
the
federal
rule
of
standing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
to
get
out
the
blue
book
of
citations
to
decide
whether
there
is
an
adequate
and
independent
state--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
makes
you
think
that
that
is
parting
company
with
the
federal
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
now,
mr.
broad,
about
a
federal
constitutional
obligation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
questions
from
the
bench
have
side-tracked
you
from
what
i
thought
was
your
argument
that
this
is
basically
a
state
law
ground
ultimately
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
taken.
i
had
not
understood
you
at
this
point
to
be
defending
the
federal
constitutional
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
you
think,
if
it
were
an
implementing
rule
that
is
state-based,
assuming
that
the
justices
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
know
how
to
write
opinions
as
well
as
everyone
else,
that
that
would
have
appeared
in
the
first
part
of
the
opinion,
where
you
are
talking
about
various
state
law
bases
for
recovery,
not
as
your
opponent
has
quoted,
the
first
two
sentences
of
the
section
called
5a,
where
they
say,
"the
hospital
argues
the
prohibition
against
deliberate
indifference
compels
a
government
agency
or
division
responsible
for
supplying
those
medical
needs
to
pay
for
them.
"
then
they
say,
"we
agree".
there
is
no
intimation
that
there
is
any
bridge
there
between
the
constitutional
obligation
and
the
result.
