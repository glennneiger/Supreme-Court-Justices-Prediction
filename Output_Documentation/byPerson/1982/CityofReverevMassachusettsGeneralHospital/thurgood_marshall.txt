what
is
the
duty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
it
is
not
continuing
duty,
but
what
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
that
is
not
continuing?
justice
thurgood

then
when
he
is
carried
to
the
hospital,
and
he
sits
out
there
and
the
hospital
won't
take
him,
and
they
put
him
out
in
the
grounds
and
they
leave
him
there;
is
that
the
end
of
the
duty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
have
bit
off
a
little
more
than
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
chew.
the
point
is,
if
i
understand
your
position,
if
you
win
the
hospital
will
not
get
paid.
presumably,
they
will
just
turn
these
people
away.
so
what
happens
as
a
result
of
the
federal
constitutional
duty
then,
don't
they
just
sit
in
the
parking
lot
in
an
ambulance?
justice
thurgood

it
is
sort
of
pendant
jurisdiction.

justice
thurgood

if
it
wasn't
raised,
it
is
not
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
raised,
and
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
just
went
completely
off,
what,
base,
and
decided
a
federal
question
which
they
had
no
right
to
decide,
either
one
of
them.
is
that
your
position,
because
if
that
is
your
position,
you
don't
win.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--which
state
law
were
they
passing
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
state
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
they
were
passing
on
state
law,
and
i
am
asking
you
which
state
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
common
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
city
of
revere
overloaded
with
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
chief
justice's
earlier
question
that
he
missed
the
culprit
and
shot
an
innocent
bystander,
the
same
policeman,
revere
wouldn't
be
responsible
for
that
bill,
would
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
thug
gets
protection
and
an
ordinary
citizen
doesn't
get
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
may
be
in
general,
but
that
is
not
normal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
not
generally
held.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
tell
me
what
your
argument
is.
if
i
heard
you
correctly,
you
said
there
are
a
multitude
of
cases
in
federal
district
courts
on
that,
and
this
is
a
state
court
decision.
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
a
federal
court
decision,
which
is
the
point
we
have
been
trying
to
get
through
to
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
that
it
is
no
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
had
better
stick
to
this
one,
and
not
try
to
decide
other
ones.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
way
it
stands
on
a
state
court
opinion,
which
gives
the
state
court
the
right
to
decide
a
federal
standing
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
a
possibility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
should
we
leave
that
possibility
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
frankly,
it
is
not
unclear
to
me,
but
i
can
only
speak
for
one.
