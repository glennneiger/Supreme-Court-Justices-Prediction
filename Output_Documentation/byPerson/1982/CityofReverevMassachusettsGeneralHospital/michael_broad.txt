mr.
michael
broad
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
initial
question
in
this
case
is
in
fact
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
the
question
of
standing.
the
petitioner,
of
course,
has
the
burden
of
establishing
that
jurisdiction.
nonetheless,
the
petitioner
comes
to
this
court
arguing
now
that
the
hospital
lacks
standing.
the
hospital
suggests
to
the
court
that
on
the
basis
of
that
allegation
and
that
argument,
the
court
should
properly
dismiss
the
writ
of
certiorari,
accepting
the
petitioner's
claim
that
there
is
no
standing
in
the
federal
sense.
i
suggest
that
the
resolution
ought
to
be
to
dismiss
the
writ
and
not
to
reverse
the
court
below,
because,
of
course,
the
state
court
is
freer
to
fashion
a
broader
rule
of
standing
than
the
federal
court
would
be.
mr.
michael
broad
i
think
in
order
to
determine
what
the
court
in
fact
did,
justice
rehnquist,
we
might
look
very
closely
at
that
footnote
7
on
page
26
of
the
appendix
to
which
my
brother
has
already
referred.
the
footnote
consists
of
two,
and
only
two
paragraphs.
the
first
paragraph
acknowledges
that
there
may
be
a
question
of
standing
but
finds
it
waived,
clearly
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
citing
the
applicable
state
rule
of
appellate
procedure.
my
brother
construes
the
second
paragraph
as
a
decision
on
the
federal
question
of
standing,
and
i
firmly
disagree.
the
second
paragraph
starts
out,
"furthermore,
standing
to
litigate
constitutional
issues
is
sometimes
granted
to
persons.
"
the
court
is
making
clearly
the
observation
that
it
would
not
be
unheard
of,
as
a
matter
of
jurisprudence,
for
a
third
party
to
have
standing
in
a
case
like
this,
but
i
find
nothing
whatsoever
in
that
paragraph
that
suggests
that
the
supreme
court
purports
to
decide
or
in
fact
has
decided
that
issue.
indeed,
the
two
references
in
the
paragraph
to
which
my
brother
has
already
referred,
the
two
federal
references,
are
preceded
by
a
c
cite
and
a
cf
cite,
and
i
suggest
that
is
not
the
way
that
the
court
would
have
decided
the
federal
issue,
if
it
purported
to
do
so.
so
on
the
basis
of
that--
mr.
michael
broad
--i
suggest
that
what
the
court
has
done
is
decided
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
your
honor,
pointing
out
in
passing,
and
this
is
not
so
uncommon
for
a
state
court--
mr.
michael
broad
--the
waiver
question,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
michael
broad
whether
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
question
of
standing
can
be
waived.
mr.
michael
broad
i
am
not
saying,
your
honor,
a
state
statute.
i
am
saying
a
state
rule
of
procedure
and
a
state
rule
of
waiver.
mr.
michael
broad
it
is
in
part
common
law.
it
is
in
part
codified
in
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
16(a)(4)
cited
on
the
bottom
of
page
27.
where
the
federal
court
might
properly
decide
that
a
standing
issue
is
jurisdictional
and
can
never
be
waived,
the
state
court
may
properly
take
a
different
approach,
and
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
in
fact,
in
other
cases,
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
expressly
declined
to
follow
federal
rules
of
standing.
in
this
case,
where
the
state
court
parted
company
with
the
federal
rule,
with
the
federal
approach,
i
submit,
is
on
the
question
of
waiver,
and
found
that
that
issue
had
been
waived.
mr.
michael
broad
perhaps
i
have
over-spoken,
your
honor,
and
it
is
certainly
not
essential
to
my
argument
that
that
would
be
parting
company,
just
that
it
is
clearly
presented
here
in
the
first
paragraph
solely
as
a
state
law
issue.
i
suggest,
therefore,
that
because
it
is
open
to
the
state
court
to
adopt
a
rule
of
standing
that
allows
waiver,
whether
or
not
the
federal
court
would
have
done
the
same
thing
under
those
circumstances,
is
fully
appropriate
for
a
state
court
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
it
would
be
improper
for
this
court,
with
all
respect,
to
reverse
the
state
court
on
that
ground
and
tell
the
state
court
that
it
had
to
do
something
different,
that
it
had
to
follow
a
different
rule
because
perhaps
that
would
be
the
federal
rule.
in
the
rest
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
the
hospital
suggests
that
the
state
supreme
court
was
recognizing,
implicitly
or
explicitly,
certain
special
circumstances
in
massachusetts
that
ought
to
govern
the
resolution
of
this
case.
my
brother
has
stood
before
the
court
this
morning...
this
afternoon,
i
am
sorry,
and
announced
that
this
is
a
question
that
should
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
policy,
and
we
agree.
we
think
it
was
decided
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
that
the
decision
below
fully
reflects
the
state
policies.
in
massachusetts,
unlike
most
states,
there
is
both
a
state
rate
setting
commission
that
sets
hospital
rates,
that
fixes
the
rates
that
we
can
charge,
and
there
is
also
a
revenue
account
that
places
a
ceiling,
a
limitation
on
the
aggregate
gross
revenue
of
a
hospital.
so
that
in
two
different
ways,
a
hospital's
revenue
are
severely
curtailed
by
the
state.
recognizing
that
fact,
which
has
received
an
incredible
amount
of
publicity
in
the
state,
and
recognizing
also,
as
the
supreme
judicial
court
did
in
the
early
section
of
this
opinion,
that
none
of
the
traditional
elements
of
the
state
common
law
would
have
provided
a
payment
rule,
it
was,
we
submit,
fully
appropriate
for
the
court
to
go
on
and
ask
the
obvious
next
question,
which
is,
at
least,
given
the
current
financial
circumstances
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
the
fact
that
hospitals,
such
as
the
massachusetts
general
hospital,
have
found
it
necessary
to
impose,
for
example,
wage
and
salary
freezes,
that
some
hospitals
have
started
laying
off
employees--
mr.
michael
broad
--overloaded
with
money?
mr.
michael
broad
i
don't
know
the
answer.
i
suspect
the
answer
is
no.
but
what
the
city
of
revere
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
to
shift
its
burden,
its
obligation
on
to
the
hospital.
we
think
that
is
inappropriate.
it
certainly
would
be
open
to
the
city
of
revere,
if
it
felt
it
desirable--
mr.
michael
broad
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
think
i
heard
counsel
very
clearly
start
out
this
afternoon
by
acknowledging
that
there
is
at
least
some
obligation
to
do
at
least
something
to
provide
treatment.
i
suggest
that
he
stopped
too
soon
in
expressing
that
obligation,
and
that,
for
example,
merely
picking
up
the
injured
party
who
was,
by
the
acknowledgement
of
the
revere
police...
this
appears
in
the
appendix
at
page
11,
that
revere
police
came
to
the
hospital
and
informed
hospital
personnel
that
the
suspect
was
then
under
arrest.
mr.
michael
broad
a
federal
constitutional
obligation.
your
honor,
not
to
be
deliberately
indifferent
to
the
medical
needs
of
a
person
in
custody.
i
think
the
state
supreme
court
took
that
underlying
constitutional
obligation
as
essentially
undisputed.
yes,
revere
argues
a
bit
about
whether
the
person
was
really
in
custody
or
not
in
this
case,
and
the
state
court
disposes
of
that
rather
quickly.
mr.
michael
broad
i
think
your
honor
understands
my
argument
correctly
and
has
stated
it,
in
fact,
quite
well.
all
i'm
pointing
out
is
that
i
think
in
fashioning
the
state
rule,
the
state
implementing
rule,
that
the
state
supreme
court
could
legitimately
have
in
mind
the
burden
of
protecting
the
underlying
constitutional
argument.
mr.
michael
broad
that
is
not
how
i
would
read
the
opinion.
mr.
michael
broad
i
think,
your
honor,
that
what
the
state
court
did
was
to
fashion
a
rule
to
protect
an
underlying
constitutional
right,
without
saying
that
the
particular
implementing
rule
was
itself
required
by
the
constitution.
it
is
not
unusual,
your
honor,
to
see
in
cases
a
question
of
remedy,
and
the
essence
of
structuring
a
remedy
is,
of
course,
making
a
choice
among
various
alternatives
that
might
be
open.
mr.
michael
broad
the
transition
there,
your
honor,
i
agree,
may
be
a
bit
choppy.
if
i
could
refer
the
court
to
the
top
of
page
29
of
the
appendix,
and
the
bottom
of
page
28,
this
is
the
part
of
the
opinion
where
the
court
is
really
getting
into
the
discussion
of
the
issue
as
opposed
to
the
preliminaries.
the
court
says
that
the
person
in
question
was
brought
to
the
hospital
as
a
prisoner...
i
am
reading
from
the
bottom
of
page
28...
and
that
revere
has
a
legal
duty
to
supply
him
with
necessary
medical
care.
then
it
goes
on
to
say:
"to
ensure
the
prisoner's
right
to
medical
care.
"
i
think
that
speaks
of
implementing,
"to
ensure
medical
care,
revere
must
be
held
liable
to
the
hospital.
"
notice,
your
honor,
that
the
two
citations
that
follow
that
are
citations
to
state
cases,
not
to
federal
cases,
not
to
federal
constitutional
cases.
so
i
would
suggest
that
perhaps
the
court
would
not
have
reached
that
question
if
it
had
not
been
concerned
with
ultimately
protecting
an
acknowledged
federal
constitutional
right,
but
that
a
state
court
ought
to
have
greater
latitude
to
fashion
the
means
for
protecting
the
right
than
perhaps
a
federal
court
would,
because
obviously
the
intrusion
that
a
federal
court
can
justify
into
the
state
sphere
is
limited,
and
this
court
has
held
that
repeatedly
in
cases
like
milliken
versus
bradley.
mr.
michael
broad
that
would
be.
mr.
michael
broad
but
it
could
be
put
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
it
could
also
have
been
put,
that
hypothetical,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
but
the
next
question
is,
is
it
open
to
a
state
court,
as
opposed
to
the
federal
court,
to
go
a
step
further
and
specify
the
means
by
which
the
prisoner's
medical
treatment
is
to
be
guaranteed.
certainly,
the
state
supreme
court
had
to
realize
that
it
would
have
been
open
to
a
prisoner
whose
constitutional
rights
were
violated
to
bring
an
action
under,
for
example,
1983.
in
such
a
case,
we
might
have
expected
to
see
in
the
state
court
repeated
inquiry
into
the
particular
special
circumstances
of
each
of
the
individual
cases.
mr.
michael
broad
there
is
no
underlying
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
care
for
an
innocent
bystander.
so
i
agree,
your
honor,
under
this
opinion--
mr.
michael
broad
--generally,
your
honor,
when
a
person
is
in
custody--
mr.
michael
broad
--your
honor,
i
suggest--
mr.
michael
broad
--in
harris
v.
mccrea,
this
court
very
clearly
held
that
the
government
does
not
in
general
have
an
obligation
to
provide
funding
to
allow
its
citizens
to
exercise
what
may
otherwise
be
their
constitutional
rights.
but
there
are
cases
of
this
court,
and
the
cases
are
legion
in
the
lower
federal
courts,
in
which
the
state
has
clearly
been
found
to
have
an
obligation
and
an
obligation
to
pay
to
ensure
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
very
limited
class
of
people,
and
i
am
talking
about
those
people
who
are
in
state
custody,
in
state
institutions
or
in
state
schools
for
people
who
are
mentally
disabled.
mr.
michael
broad
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
broad
i
suggest
that
anything,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
broad
--i
suggest,
if
anything,
the
state
court
ought
to
have
greater
deference
and
greater
opportunity
to
fashion
the
rule
than
a
federal
court
would.
yes,
this
is
clearly
a
state
court
decision.
if
this
were
a
federal
court
decision,
then
i
think
this
court
would
be
required
to
review
it
quite
closely
and
carefully.
mr.
michael
broad
i
think
that
would
be
the
case
if
it
were
a
federal
court
decision,
because
the
federal
court
would
have
had
to
limit
carefully
its
intrusion
into
state
affairs.
but
in
a
state
court
decision,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
michael
broad
i
was
not
trial
counsel,
your
honor,
so
i
don't
know
what
happened
at
that
argument
in
the
case.
but
in
reading
the
brief,
i
think
it
may
be,
in
all
candor,
a
little
bit
unclear
exactly
what
argument
was
made.
it
is
clear
that
the
hospital
raised
the
eighth
amendment,
i
think
correctly
it
should
have
been
the
14th
amendment,
i
would
probably
say,
with
an
idea
of
alerting
the
state
court
to
the
fact
that
there
was
an
underlying
responsibility--
mr.
michael
broad
--that
is
not
stated
at
least
so
clearly
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
to
be
able
to
determine
which
way
it
came
down.
i
would
suggest
that
consistent
with
the
opinions
of
this
court,
insofar
as
it
may
not
be
entirely
clear
whether
we
have
a
federal
law
decision,
a
state
law
decision,
or
some
amalgam
intertwining
the
two,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
remand
the
case
to
the
state
supreme
court
under
a
minnesota
versus
national
t
approach,
and
suggest
respectfully
that
the
state
court
might
clarify
that
issue,
because
as
this
court
has
observed--
mr.
michael
broad
--i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
federal--
mr.
michael
broad
--i
don't
believe,
with
all
respect,
that
the
federal
standing
question
was
decided
in
this
case.
it
may
be
that
we
are
reading
that
note
differently,
but
i
think
it
was
decided--
mr.
michael
broad
--that
might
also
be.
mr.
michael
broad
you
might
also...
if
it
is
unclear
to
the
court
what
the
basis
was
for
that
section
of
the
decision,
it
might
also
be
remanded
under
a
national--
mr.
michael
broad
--i
understand.
i
would
like
to
address,
at
least
briefly,
some
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
court
in
the
city's
argument,
the
question
of
other
obligations
that
might
exist
for
the
provision
of
care
by
the
hospital.
my
brother
made
a
reference
to
a
state
law,
by
which
i
assume
he
meant
the
patient's
bill
of
rights
in
massachusetts...
massachusetts'
general
law
is
chapter
111
section
70(e)...
which
in
fact
did
not
become
effective
until
the
year
following
the
events
that
gave
rise
to
this
case
and,
therefore,
as
at
least
a
technical
matter,
has
no
bearing
here.
but
i
would
like
to
read
the
first
words
of
the
relevant
section
of
that
part
of
the
statute
that
talks
about
the
right
of
a
hospital
patient.
it
gives
the
hospital
patient
the
right
to
prompt
lifesaving
treatment,
not
emergency
treatment,
prompt
lifesaving
treatment
in
an
emergency.
clearly
the
state
legislature
in
that
statute
has
cut
out
a
much
more
circumscribed
area
of
medical
care
than
my
brother
would
have
suggested,
i
think,
in
his
argument.
in
our
brief,
we
have
also
cited
relevant
sections
from
the
medicare
hospital
manual
at
footnote
58
on
page
34
of
the
brief,
where
the
federal
government,
at
least
an
agency
of
the
government,
very
clearly
takes
the
position
that
medicare
payment
may
not
be
made
for
services
provided
to
prisoners
because
the
state
or
other
governmental
agency
is
already
responsible
for
their
medical
care.
in
general,
the
position
of
the
hospital
is,
first,
that
the
court
ought
not
reach
the
merits
because
it
should
find
that
the
state
court
was
free
to
have
decided
the
case
under
state
rules
of
standing,
but
that,
as
argued
by
the
petitioner,
this
court
ought
not
to
proceed
to
decide
this
case,
the
standing
question
on
the
merits,
should
accept
the
allegation
of
petitioner,
and
should
dismiss
the
writ
for
lack
of
standing.
but
if
the
court
were
inclined
to
go
further,
we
suggest,
first,
that
the
decision
is
not
a
constitutional
decision,
but
is
an
implementing
decision.
while
the
state
courts
do
not
have
the
authority

misinterpret
the
constitution,
they
should
clearly
be
allowed
the
authority
to
craft
a
remedy
that
might
be
somewhat
broader
than
a
federal
court
could
do
in
seeking
to
protect
the
underlying
constitutional
rights,
in
order
to
protect
in
advance
and
make
it
unnecessary
for
a
prisoner
later
to
bring
an
action
for
damages,
clearly
a
less
satisfactory
alternative.
finally,
insofar
as
there
may
be
some
disagreement
among
members
of
the
court,
or
some
uncertainty
in
the
mind
of
the
court
as
to
the
exact
basis
of
the
decision
on
either
point,
whether
state
or
federal,
the
hospital
suggests
in
conclusion
that
that
it
would
be
more
appropriate
to
ask
the
state
court
what
was
intended
than
to
presume
to
tell
it.
