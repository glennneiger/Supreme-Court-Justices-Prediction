justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
as
soon
as
the
person
was
shot,
did
the
police
or
the
city
of
revere
have
any
federal
obligation
to
him
at
all;
could
they
just
let
him
lie
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
federal
obligation,
if
any,
did
they
have
to
the
man
before
they
picked
him
up
and
took
him
to
the
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
when
the
ambulance
driver
picked
him
up
and
took
him
to
the
hospital,
the
hospital
said:
"we
are
not
going
to
take
him
unless
we
know
who
is
going
to
pay
the
bill.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that
had
happened...
if
that
had
happened,
would
the
city
of
revere
had
any
further
federal
constitutional
obligation
at
that
point
in
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
even
to
take
him
to
some
other
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that
they
have
the
obligation
to
pick
him
up
and
put
him
in
an
ambulance,
but
they
don't
have
any
obligation
to
make
sure
that
the
ambulance
gets
any
place
that
will
do
him
any
good.
isn't
that
a
strange
federal
obligation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
one
not
say
precisely
the
same
thing
about
leaving
him
in
an
ambulance
unattended
in
a
parking
lot
of
a
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
i
am
asking
not
the
driver,
but
the
city.
you
say
that
the
city
had
the
obligation
to
put
him
in
an
ambulance
in
order
to
avoid
the
risk
that
he
would
just
suffer
great
pain
on
the
street,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
he
continues
to
suffer
pain
in
the
ambulance
and
there
is
no
doctor
around
to
alleviate
that
pain,
does
their
duty
terminate,
or
do
they
have
a
continuing
duty
until
they
find
somebody
who
will
take
care
of
him.
that
is
what
i
was
asking.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
that.
supposing
we
agreed
with
you
on
your
standing
argument,
and
we
concluded
that
mass.
general
has
no
standing
to
raise
the
federal
constitutional
question.
should
we
then
not
ourselves
refuse
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
federal
constitutional
question,
and
merely
vacate
the
judgment
and
send
it
back
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
and
let
it
determine
whether
as
a
matter
of
state
law
there
is
standing?
i
think
you
are
arguing
we
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
merits
of
the
federal
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
even
if
it
is
prudential,
you
are
saying,
as
a
matter
of
our
own
prudential
rule,
we
should
not
address
the
matter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
like
saying
that,
in
effect,
the
massachusetts
court
has
given
an
advisory
opinion
on
a
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
state
had
a
procedure
whereby
its
supreme
court
could
render
advisory
opinions,
and
they
were
asked
to
render
an
advisory
opinion
on
this
very
issue.
they
said,
"the
bill
has
been
paid
in
this
case,
but
we
want
to
set
the
law
for
the
future.
"
"as
a
matter
of
federal
eighth
amendment
law,
these
bills
must
be
paid
by
the
city.
"
this
court
couldn't
review
such
an
advisory
opinion,
could
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
put
you
are
saying
that
we
should
reverse
their
determination
of
standing.
it
seems
to
me,
once
we
do
that,
we
should
not
have
the
power
to
go
forward,
or
maybe
i
miss
your
argument,
and
decide
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
he
is
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
telling
me
that
they
decided
two
issues
of
federal
law.
one,
the
merits;
and
two,
the
standing
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
broad,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
opinion
that
begins
the
eighth
amendment
discussion
and
has
the
footnote
7
about
waiver
in
it,
and
then
they
say,
"we
agree".
the
argument,
"the
hospital
argues
that
the
prohibition
against
deliberate
indifference.
"
and
so
forth,
"includes
an
obligation
to
pay".
your
opponent,
as
i
understood
his
argument,
said
that
the
reason
there
shouldn't
be
waiver,
as
the
court
says
in
the
footnote,
is
that
you
really
didn't
make
the
argument
that
the
massachusetts
court
said
you
made.
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
says
the
argument
was
that
the
eighth
amendment
created
a
duty
to
take
him
to
the
hospital,
but
that
gave
rise
an
implied
contract
to
pay,
and
that
as
of
state
law
you
can't
have
such
an
implied
contract.
