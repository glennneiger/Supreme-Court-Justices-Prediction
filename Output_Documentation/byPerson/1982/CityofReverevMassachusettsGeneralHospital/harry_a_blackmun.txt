justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
why
they
took
him
to
mgh
rather
than
boston
city?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
much?
not
very
much.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
time
of
day
make
the
distance--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--but
at
least
boston
city
was
a
municipal
hospital.
mgh,
theoretically,
is
a
private
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
was
the
reason
for
taking
him
to
mgh,
other
than
closeness
in
terms
of
traffic?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
result
is
that
you
are
imposing
this
cost
on
a
private
hospital
in
contrast
to
imposing
it
on
a
municipal
hospital.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
aren't
you
weaseling
the
words
there?
the
city
doesn't
want
any
responsibility
for
it.
let
somebody
else
pay
for
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
should
boston
city
accept
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
isn't
a
revere
hospital.
revere
is
not
part
of
the
city
of
boston,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
fine
for
you
to
say
that
mgh
should
take
care
of
the
emergency,
and
then
what,
put
him
on
the
street?
suppose
that
boston
city
said,
"we
are
full".
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
emergency
rooms...
why
couldn't
mgh
say,
"we
have
a
fine
emergency
facility
here,
even
though
you
have
to
wait
for
20
hours
sometimes.
"
why
couldn't
they
say,
"we'll
take
emergency
paying
patients",
period?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
you
had
no
such
state
law,
then
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
your
argument
implies,
i
am
not
saying
it's
wrong,
is
that
maybe
mgh
should
close
its
emergency
wing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts.
a
police
officer
of
the
city
of
revere
wounded
a
suspect
who
was
attempting
to
flee
from
the
scene
of
a
reported
crime.
the
police
called
a
private
ambulance
and
the
ambulance
took
him
to
massachusetts
general
hospital.
when
he
was
eventually
released,
the
hospital
sent
the
city
a
rather
substantial
bill
for
its
services.
the
city
refused
to
pay
and
the
hospital
sued.
the
massachusetts
court
held
that
the
city
was
responsible
for
the
medical
services
rendered
by
the
hospital
to
the
wounded
suspect
and
did
so
primarily
on
eighth
amendment
grounds.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
holding.
we
conclude
that
the
massachusetts
court
was
in
error
when
it
premised
city's
liabilities
squarely
on
the
eighth
amendment's
prohibition
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
the
relevant
constitutional
provision
is
not
the
eighth
amendment
but
instead
is
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
eighth
amendment
scrutiny
is
appropriate
only
after
the
state
has
secured
a
formal
adjudication
of
guilt,
and
here
there
been
no
such
adjudication.
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
responsible
governmental
entity
to
provide
medical
care
to
persons
who
have
been
injured
while
being
apprehended
by
the
police.
however,
so
long
as
a
governmental
entity
ensures
that
the
medical
care
is
in
fact
provided,
the
constitution
does
not
dictate
how
the
cost
of
that
care
should
be
allocated
as
between
a
governmental
entity
and
the
provider
care.
that
instead
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
white.
and
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
