mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
a
municipality
is
obligated
by
the
constitution
to
reimburse
a
hospital
for
the
cost
of
medical
treatment
rendered
to
a
person
suspected
of
a
crime.
let
me
briefly
summarize
the
facts.
on
september
20th,
1978,
the
revere
police
were
called
to
respond
to
a
reported
burglary
at
a
dwelling
house
in
revere,
massachusetts.
the
police
arrived
at
the
scene,
observed
an
individual
leaving
the
home
with
a
suitcase
and
a
pillow-case,
and
this
individual
was
later
identified
as
one
patrick
kivlin.
as
a
result,
the
police
sought
to
detain
him,
and
mr.
kivlin
attempted
to
flee.
after
repeated
warnings
and
a
warning
shot,
mr.
kivlin
was
shot
by
a
police
officer
for
the
city
of
revere.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
yes,
your
honor,
except
that
the
revere
police
secured
an
arrest
warrant
from
the
chelsea
district
court,
the
local
court
of
appropriate
jurisdiction.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
later
on,
after...
while
mr.
kivlin
was
still
in
the
hospital.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
we
would
submit
that
he
was
not,
other
than
in
the
practical
sense
that
he
was
incapacitated
and
could
not
move
away
on
his
own.
but
we
would
not
contend
that
there
is
any
meaning
to
custody
at
that
stage.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
suspect
was
in
need
of
emergency
medical
attention,
and
the
police
officers
for
the
city
of
revere
did
the
appropriate
thing,
they
called
an
ambulance,
the
ambulance
arrived
and
took
mr.
kivlin
to
the
emergency
ward
at
massachusetts
general
hospital.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
it
does
not,
your
honor,
except
that
geographically
massachusetts
general
hospital
is
closer.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
it
depends
upon
the
time
of
day,
but
i
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
course--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--in
terms
of
traffic
conditions
at
the
scene,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
i
would
think
no
other,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
judgment
exercised
in
this
regard
was
exercised
by
the
ambulance
driver.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
we
are
not
claiming
in
this
litigation,
your
honor,
that
it
is
the
private
hospital
that
must
bear
this
burden.
we
are
simply
saying,
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
city
must
bear
this
burden
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
mandate.
who
bears
the
burden
is--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--the
decision
of
who
pays
is
necessarily
a
legislative
one,
and
properly
belongs
with
the
legislature
or
the
congress
and
not
the
courts,
at
least
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not
contend
that--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--i
believe
that
the
police
officers
had
the
obligation
to
call
the
ambulance,
to
provide
him
with
access
to
emergency
medical
attention.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
yes,
because
i
believe--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--then
that
is
not
a
deprivation
of
rights
that
revere
has
visited
on--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--i
believe
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
the
reason,
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
is
out
of
the
negative.
were
they
to
leave
him
lying
on
the
street
or
were
they
to
take
him
to
the
station
house
and
attempt
to
undergo
the
normal
booking
procedures
while
he
was
injured
and
in
need
of
medical
attention,
that
would
be
a
way
of
inflicting
punishment
upon
him.
that
is
where,
i
believe,
they
would
run
afoul
of
the
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
no,
because
as
a
practical
matter
the
ambulance...
the
ambulance
driver
doesn't
simply
leave
him
there,
and
really
the
threat
that
you
speak
of
is
simply
a
hypothetical
one.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
i
do
not
believe
the
duty
is
continuing,
but
it
is
a
fact
pattern
that
is
not
presented
in
this
case
as
being--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--the
duty
is--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--the
duty
is
not
to
deny
him
access
to
medical
attention.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
it
is
simply
not
to
inflict
punishment
on
him
by
refusing
to--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--i
do
not
believe
that
the
city
has
a
continuing
obligation
at
that
stage.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
that
danger
is
really
a
hypothetical
one,
and
as
demonstrated
in
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
the
hospital
will
not
simply
turn
the
people
away.
the
hospital
is
under
a
series
of
obligations.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
they
had
no
guarantee
whatsoever.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
nonetheless,
they
took
him,
and
what's
more
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
they
took
him
a
second
time
fully
a
week
after
the
chief
of
the
revere
police
department
notified
them
that
revere
had
no
intention
of
paying
this
particular
bill.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
there
is
an
express
law
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
by
statute
which
provides
that
any
hospital
with
an
emergency
wing
must
provide
emergency
medical
care
to
all
those
who
need
it.
the
fact
is,
it
is
a
matter
of
policy
and
custom,
as
well
as
law,
that
hospitals
provide
emergency
medical
care
to
those
in
need
without
regard
to
the
source
of
payment.
that
is
the
language
of
the
particular
statute.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
massachusetts
general
hospital
is
a
non-profit
organization,
and
if
you
look--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--necessarily,
when
the
hospital
opens
its
doors
and
says
to
the
public
that
it
has
an
emergency
wing,
it
must
necessarily
provide
the
emergency
services
that
are
required.
the
difference,
and
what
may
well
have
occurred
under...
had
the
hospital
realized
that
revere
would
not
pay
this
bill,
perhaps
the
hospital
would
not
have
permitted
the
patient
to
stay
in
the
hospital
for
the
full
10
days.
at
that
stage,
after
stabilizing
him
and
giving
him
the
emergency
medical
treatment,
they
could
have
transferred
him
to
boston
city
hospital,
or
another
publicly
supported
institution.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
because
boston
city
is
a
publicly
supported
institution.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
but
it
is
obligated
to
accept--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--boston
city
is
under
an
obligation,
as
are
publicly
supported
hospitals,
to
treat
those
in
need.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
because
state
law
says--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--i
think
there
is
a
common
law
obligation.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
if
it
sought
to
avoid
the
outcome
in
this
case,
and
if
its
appeals
to
the
legislature
to
do
something
with
regard
to
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
we
are
unveiling,
that
might
well
be
their
alternative.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
yes,
your
honor.
under
certain
circumstances,
hospitals
that
do
accept
federal
aid
are
required
to
provide
treatment
to
indigents,
and
there
are
a
series
of
legislative
enactments
in
this
area,
but
perhaps
not
one
that
satisfies
this
particular
case.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
in
that
situation,
assuming
that
the
individual
did
not
have
a
state
law
tort
remedy
against
the
individual
officer,
so
that
assuming
that
there
is
no
fault,
as
there
is
no
indication
in
this
case
that
there
was
any
fault
on
the
part
of
the
revere
police,
the
hospital
is
left
in
the
identical
situation.
an
individual
hurt,
in
need
of
medical
attention,
goes
to
the
hospital
and
must
receive
treatment.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
in
my
view,
it
is
irrelevant
and
ought
not
to
be
viewed
as
dispositive
by
this
court.
if
i
may
elaborate
on
your
hypothetical.
suppose
mr.
kivlin,
the
suspect,
had
had
a
gun,
and
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
had
fired
a
shot
that
hit
that
bystander
prior
to
the
time
that
the
policeman
felled
mr.
kivlin
with
his
bullet.
under
that
circumstance
we
would
have
had
two
ambulances,
or
two
people
in
the
ambulance,
one
suspect
and
one
innocent
bystander,
left
in
the
same
position
under
the
supreme
judicial
court's
formulation.
the
suspect
would
have
a
guaranteed
right
to
free
medical
care,
and
the
innocent
bystander
clearly
would
not.
i
think
it
demonstrates
that
the
injured
suspect
in
this
case
was
in
no
different
position
from
any
citizen
who
is
injured
on
the
street
and
in
need
of
emergency
medical
care.
i
would
like
to
address
a
threshold
issue
for
a
moment,
that
is,
massachusetts
general
hospital's
challenge
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
according
to
massachusetts
general
hospital,
only
state
law
issues
are
involved
in
this
case,
and
there
is...
or
at
least
there
is
an
independent
and
adequate
state
law
remedy
to
support...
state
law
grounds,
excuse
me,
to
support
the
judgment
below.
this
view
rests
on
a
single
premise
that
the
opinion
below
was
based
upon
a
state
created
implementing
rule,
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
that
what
the
supreme
judicial
court
did
was
merely
create
a
so-called
implementing
rule.
this
viewpoint
distorts
the
clean
language
of
the
opinion
below
as
well
as
the
state
law
precedents
relied
on
by
the
supreme
judicial
court
in
the
court
below.
the
language
of
the
opinion
could
hardly
be
plainer.
after
rejecting
all
forms
of
state
law
contractual
recovery,
the
court
below
held
and
i
quote:
"we
hold
that
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
embodied
in
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
requires
that
revere
be
liable
to
the
hospital
for
the
medical
services
rendered
kivlin
during
his
first
stay.
"
later
in
the
opinion,
in
its
section
entitled
"eight
amendment",
the
court
characterizes
the
position
of
the
hospital
as
follows:
"the
hospital
argues
that
the
prohibition
against
deliberate
indifference
to
the
medical
needs
of
prisoners
contained
implicitly
in
the
eighth
amendment
compels
a
government
agency,
or
division
responsible
for
supplying
those
medical
needs,
to
pay
for
them.
"
in
response
to
this
assertion,
the
supreme
judicial
court
responded
with
two
words,
"we
agree".
the
opinion
below
that
revere
must
be
liable
to
the
hospital
is
clearly
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
is
clearly
derived
in
the
minds
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
from
the
eighth
amendment.
there
can
be
no
independent
and
adequate
state
law
ground
to
support
the
judgment
below
since
the
supreme
judicial
court
held
in
the
first
part
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
illegal
for
revere,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
to
pay
massachusetts
general
hospital.
under
the
law
of
the
commonwealth,
massachusetts
has
strict
rules
against
allowing
any
form
of
contractual
recovery
against
a
municipality
unless
the
prerequisites
to
a
valid
contract
are
in
place.
therefore,
the
phrase
that
mass.
general
uses
in
this
context,
its
implementing
rule,
is
simply
a
polite
way
of
trying
to
reintroduce
its
theory
of
an
implied
contract,
implied
contract
that
requires
that
revere
pay
the
bill
of
mass.
general.
this
theory
was
rejected
by
the
court
below.
therefore,
there
is
no
state
law
ground
upon
which
to
rest
the
judgment
below.
rather
the
judgment
below
clearly
rests
upon
the
supreme
judicial
court's
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
with
respect
to
the
standing
issue,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
prudential
concerns
behind
the
standing
doctrine
ought
to
operate
to
deny
mass.
general
the
right
to
raise
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
suspect
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case.
in
this
case,
based
upon
the
record,
no
rights
of
the
suspect
were
violated,
and
the
only
threat,
if
indeed
there
is
one,
comes
from
the
implied
threat
of
massachusetts
general
hospital
not
to
treat
in
future
cases.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
in
this
circumstance,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
your
honor,
this
court
is
free
to
judge
by
federal
rules
of
standing,
since
it
is
clear
in
the
court's
footnote
in
the
opinion
below
that
it
was
applying
federal
laws
of
standing.
therefore
it
is
a
federal
question
that
this
court
is
free
to
consider.
had
they
applied
state
law
rules
of
standing,
then
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
the
issue
would
be
foreclosed.
but
under
these
circumstances,
i
think
the
issue
is
open
to
this
court.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
this
is
footnote
no.

on
pages
26
and
27
of
the
record
appendix.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
the
citations
are
to
the
barrows
case
and
to
a
treatise
on
the
federal
courts
by
professor
wright.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
yes,
your
honor,
but
nonetheless
submit
that
the
issue
is
properly
before
the
court.
the
supreme
judicial
court,
when
it
ruled
that
the
eighth
amendment
itself
contains
an
obligation
to
pay
on
the
part
of
revere,
went
beyond
anything
that
was
argued
in
the
court
below.
what
mass.
general
argued
in
the
court
below
was
that
the
constitutional
duty
involved
created
the
duty
upon
which
to
rest
an
implied
contract.
so
that
they
only
invoked
the
constitution
as
creating
this
duty
of
the
municipality
to
the
hospital,
and
then
the
right
to
force
payment
was
resting
as
a
function
of
implied
contract.
therefore,
since
the
issue
was
not
framed
the
way
the
supreme
judicial
court
framed
it
and
there
is
no
opportunity
to
raise
a
standing
question
in
this
fashion,
i
believe
this
issue
is
still
properly
before
the
court.
even
if
this
court
were
to
not
accept
that
contention,
i
would
submit
that
the
issue
is
properly
before
this
court
because
the
supreme
judicial
court,
although
it
suggested
that
the
issue
was
waived,
nonetheless
proceeded
to
decide
it.
having
decided
the
question,
the
issue
is
now
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
my
argument
is
not
an
article
3
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
yes,
but--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--in
the
context
of
this
particular
case,
it
was
not
an
advisory
opinion,
your
honor.
they
clearly
decided
the
question,
and
if
it
were
up
to
this
court,
then
the
court
is
free
to
simply
reverse
the
judgment
below,
and
there
is
no
need
for
a
remand
in
this
context.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
this
circumstance
the
issue
of
standing
was
heard
and
determined
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
at
that
point,
i
believe
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
my
only
disagreement
is
whether
or
not
there
should
be
a
remand
at
that
particular
stage
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
the
only
issue
that
they
decided
was
one
of
federal
law,
and
i
believe
that
there
is
no
need--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--yes,
your
honor,
but
they
decided
standing
simply
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
there
is
no
state
law
of
standing
intertwined
with
that
opinion.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
excuse
me.
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
but
it
was
not
raised
at
any
point
in
the
proceeding--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--i
agree
that
the
only
issue
before
this
court--
mr.
ira
h.
zaleznik
--they
had
the
right
to
decide,
but
we
believe
that
they
decided
in
both
circumstances
in
an
erroneous
fashion.
ultimately,
the
broad
issue
as
to
whether
there
is
any
obligation
to
reimburse
the
hospital
is
a
policy
question,
and
this
policy
question
ought
to
be
directed
towards
the
state
legislature
or
perhaps
even
to
the
congress,
and
not
to
the
court.
this
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
not
constitutional
law.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
no
constitutional
entitlement
to
the
funds
in
these
circumstances.
since
there
is
no
constitutional
entitlement
to
reimbursement,
i
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
thank
you.
i
reserve
any
remaining
time
to
rebuttal.
mr.

just
one
point,
your
honor.
my
brother
points
to
a
single
sentence
at
page
29
of
the
appendix
and
at
page
779
of
the
opinion
as
justifying
reading
the
court
below
as
creating
a
state
implementing
rule,
but
that
sentence
was
followed
by
two
sentences
saying
that
inadequate
funding
will
not
excuse
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights,
and
that
even
though
a
payment
may
be
in
violation
of
a
state
or
local
law,
it
will
not
avail
revere
of
any
relief.
so
that
it
is
clear
that
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
base
its
ruling
on
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
federal
united
states
constitution,
and
not
any
sort
of
state
law
implementing
remedy.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
