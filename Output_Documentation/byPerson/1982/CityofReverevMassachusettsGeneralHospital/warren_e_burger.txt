chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
arguments
next
in
the
city
of
revere
against
massachusetts
general
hospital.
mr.
zaleznik,
i
think
you
can
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
when
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
said
he
was
under
arrest,
since
that
bullet
hit
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
later
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
they
picked
him
up
off
the
street
to
take
him
to
the
hospital,
was
he
arrested
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
hospital
a
tax-exempt
organization,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
some
sort
of
a
quid
pro
quo
in
your
intimation
that
if
you
have
got
that
kind
of
benefit,
you
take
on
some
burdens
like
emergency
treatment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
try
another
hypothetical
on
you
addressed
at
testing
the
massachusetts
court's
theory
about
arrest
as
soon
as
this
fellow
was
hit
with
a
bullet.
suppose
the
policeman
hadn't
been
such
a
good
marksman,
and
instead
of
hitting
this
man,
he
had
hit
a
tourist
or
a
spectator,
and
that
person
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
given
all
the
same
treatment.
now
we
have
removed
the
arrest
there.
what
about
that
situation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
this
fanciful
theory
about
being
arrested
when
the
bullet
hit
him
is
irrelevant
in
your
view
to
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
broad.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
first
we
have
to
know
if
there
is
an
obligation
to
shift,
don't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
here
to
defend
an
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court,
the
highest
court,
that
there
is
a
federal
basis
for
the
obligation,
a.
federal
constitutional
basis
for
the
obligation
that
you
have
talked
about;
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
eighth
amendment
discussion
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
couldn't
the
court
have
simply
said
that
when
a
policeman,
who
is
not
a
federal
officer
in
massachusetts,
shoots
anyone
there
is
an
obligation
to
take
care
of
their
own.
that
would
be
totally
state
law,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wouldn't
be
any
of
our
business
by
which
gyrations
they
arrived
at
that
conclusion,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
zaleznik?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
city
of
revere
against
the
massachusetts
general
hospital
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
blackmun.
