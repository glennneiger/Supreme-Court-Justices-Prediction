would
it
be
related
to
the
quantity
of
water
in
the
stream?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
claiborne,
since
in
the
last
analysis
it
all
depends
in
these
dry
western
states
on
how
much
water
there
is,
how
do
you
handle
the
determination
by
both
the
federal
court
and
the
state
court
of
different
quantities
of
available
water?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
a
different
determination
of
how
much
water
is
available.
those
figures
can
vary
depending
on
who
is
deciding
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
doesn't
that
depend
in
part
on
how
much
water
there
is?
