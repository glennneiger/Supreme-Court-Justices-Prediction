justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
great
deal
of
progress,
how
much
of
that
related
to
the
indians'
claims
in
the
state
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
want
to
proceed
in
the
federal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
to
what
extent
have
their
rights
so
far
been
adjudicated
at
all
in
the
state
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
rely
on
an
entirely
different
legal
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
than
the
one
normally
applied
in
state
proceedings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
aren't
both
sets
of
cases
right
at
the
starting
point
insofar
as
the
indian
cases
are
concerned,
indian
claims
are
concerned?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
isn't
correct,
is
it,
that
you
don't
start
from
scratch
with
every
new
proceeding?
haven't
there
been
prior
proceedings
in
which
some
things
have
already
been
decided?
aren't
some
rights
already
fixed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
they
are
insufficient,
but
they
are
not
nullities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
have
some
background
that
you
are
building
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
there
had
been,
say,
a
federal
adjudication,
which
i
understand
there
hasn't,
which
determines
some
bundle
of
rights,
that
would
be
part
of
the
background--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
you
would
work
with
in
your
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
i
don't
quite
understand
why
the
conflict
of
interest
is
any
different
in
the
state
court
than
in
the
federal
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
is
not
a
reason
for
picking
one
forum
over
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
some
of
them
elected
to
proceed
to
the
federal
courts
represented
by
the
united
states,
as
i
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
unless
they
elected
to
participate
in
the
state
court.
i
can't
imagine
the
states
would
want
to
keep
them
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
a
sovereign
immunity
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
all
true
without
the
conflict
of
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
just
seems
to
me
the
conflict
of
interest
doesn't
really
add
much
to
the
argument.
