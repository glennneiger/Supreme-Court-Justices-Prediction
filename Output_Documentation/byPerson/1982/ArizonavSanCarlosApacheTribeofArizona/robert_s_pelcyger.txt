mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
may
i
start
out
by
correcting
a
misstatement
of
general
greely's?
none
of
the
tribes,
justice
white,
have
participated
in
the
state
court
proceedings
on
their
own
in
montana.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
they
have
not
entered
an
appearance
on
their
own.
their
sole
participation
is
vicarious
through
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
correct.
yes.
now,
in
this
case
there
are--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--no,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes,
that
is
my
understanding.
but
the
blackfeet,
unlike
the
other
respondent
montana
tribes
in
this
case,
are
not
parties
to
the
federal
court
cases,
so
they
are
not
here.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
correct.
now,
in
this
case,
there
are
several
statutory
and
policy
reasons
why
federal
courts
must
or
in
any
event
should
retain
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
indian
water
rights.
i
want
to
discuss
two
of
these
important
reasons.
the
first
is
the
disclaimer
act
bar,
which
is
an
absolute
jurisdictional
bar
in
our
opinion,
and
the
second
is
the
conflict
of
interest
point,
which
is
certainly
a
significant
factor
and,
we
would
claim,
decisive
factor
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
before
discussing
the
particulars
of
the
disclaimer,
however,
i
think
it
is
important
to
keep
the
big
picture
in
sharp
focus.
this
is
a
jurisdictional
dispute
that
directly
involves
indian
tribes
and
their
most
important
and
precious
property
right.
at
issue
are
the
water
rights
of
the
biggest
reservations
and
the
largest
indian
tribes
in
the
country.
states
are
asserting
jurisdiction
and
control
over
the
tribes
and
their
property,
matters
which
are
at
the
very
core
of
the
protective
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
indian
tribes,
and
from
which
the
tribes
and
their
elected
officials
historically
have
been
excluded.
the
states
are
claiming
this
power
by
virtue
of
a
statute,
the
mccarren
amendment,
that
does
no
more
on
its
face
than
simply
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
in
water
adjudication
suits.
it
does
not
mention
indians,
indian
tribes,
indian
water
rights,
or
indian
reservations,
nor
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
of
congressional
concern
about
such
critical
matters
as
tribal
sovereign
immunity,
the
federal
government's
conflict
of
interest,
the
state
court's
traditional
hostility
to
indians,
or
the
disclaimers
of
jurisdiction
in
the
enabling
acts
and
constitutions
of
the
eleven
western
states.
the
petitioners,
we
submit,
are
asking
this
court
to
do
the
work
of
the
congress
by
filling
in
all
of
these
legislative
gaps,
but
the
mccarren
amendment
is
far
too
slim
a
reed
to
carry
this
immense
weight.
it
cannot
sweep
everything
else
aside,
especially
when
effect
can
be
given
to
its
principal
purpose
as
well
as
other
relevant
laws,
treaties,
and
national
policies,
by
limiting
mccarren's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
to
the
federal
courts
in
the
disclaimer
states.
this
court's
job
is
to
reconcile
and
give
effect
to
all
of
the
relevant
laws,
not
to
pick
one
and
allow
it
to
ride
roughshod
over
all
of
the
others.
so,
the
states
and
the
petitioners'
submission
is
fundamentally
flawed,
because
the
tribes'
position
gives
effect
to
the
mccarren
amendment
in
the
disclaimer
states,
and
the
mccarren
amendment
does
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
suits
in
federal
court
to
adjudicate
indian
water
rights.
it
would
not
eviscerate
or
eliminate
the
effect
of
the
mccarren
amendment.
now,
the
colorado
river
case
stretches
the
mccarren
amendment
as
far
as
it
reasonably
can
be
extended,
but
the
colorado
river
case
expressly
rejected
the
argument
that
the
mccarren
amendment
divests
federal
courts
of
their
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
indian
water
rights.
while
the
anti-piecemealing
policy
that
the
court
perceived
in
the
mccarren
amendment
was
held
sufficient
to
justify
deference
to
an
ongoing
state
adjudication
in
certain
very
specific
and
limited
circumstances,
we
submit
that
much
more
than
that
is
required
to
overcome
the
force
of
other
equally
valid
federal
laws,
treaties,
and
policies
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
first,
let
me
speak
specifically
about
the
disclaimers.
under
the
constitution,
of
course,
indian
tribes
and
their
property
are
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
this
promise
was
repeated
in
numerous
treaties
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribes,
including
the
apache
and
navajo
treaties
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
and
after
this
court's
decision
in
1882
in
the
mcbratney
case
cast
some
doubt
on
that
proposition,
it
was
repeated
in
the
disclaimer
provisions
in
the
1889
act
admitting
montana
and
three
other
states.
it
was
repeated
again
in
the
1910
act
admitting
arizona
and
new
mexico,
and
on
six
or
seven
other
occasions,
as
recently
as
1958.
the
position
of
the
tribes
is
that
these
enabling
acts
have
not
been
changed
or
repealed,
that
they
remain
in
effect,
and
that
they
absolutely
bar
state
court
jurisdiction
over
indian
rights.
now,
there
is
little
doubt
about
what
the
mccarren...
about
what
the
disclaimers
mean,
excuse
me.
they
mean
what
they
say.
they
say
that
indian
lands,
not
forest
lands,
not
public
domain,
not
military
reservations,
only
indian
lands
shall
remain
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
until
the
disclaimers
are
revoked
with
the
consent
of
both
the
united
states
and
the
respective
state.
at
one
point
in
this
case
there
was
a
contention
that
the
disclaimers
were
limited
to
proprietary
matters.
as
i
understand
the
reply
brief
of
the
arizona
petitioners,
that
claim
is
no
longer
before
the
court,
and
i
won't
any
longer
go
into
the
meaning
of
the
disclaimers.
the
critical
questions
relate
to
the
relationship
between
the
disclaimers
and
the
mccarren
amendment.
mccarren,
as
i
said,
is
simply
a
waiver
of
the
government's
immunity,
no
more,
no
less.
there
is
no
indication
anywhere
on
the
face
of
the
act
or
in
its
history
of
any
intent
to
repeal
the
disclaimers.
there
is
no
mention
of
them.
there
is
not
even
a
hint
of
them.
and
no
one
in
this
case
has
even
argued
that
the
disclaimers
and
mccarren
are
in
irreconcilable
conflict,
the
test
for
an
implied
repeal.
effect,
as
i
said,
can
be
given
to
both
mccarren
and
the
disclaimers
by
holding
that
the
mccarren
amendment's
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
applies
to
adjudication
of
indian
water
rights
in
the
federal
courts
of
the
disclaimer
states.
this
result
achieves
the
primary
purpose
of
the
mccarren
amendment,
ensuring
that
all
water
rights
on
a
stream,
including
the
government's
and
the
indians',
will
be
subject
to
adjudication.
there
is
no
basis
anywhere
in
the
mccarren
amendment
or
in
the
governing
rules
for
construing
two
statutes
that
bear
on
a
common
subject
but
totally
subordinating
and
ignoring
the
disclaimers
in
favor
of
the
mccarren
amendment.
both
laws
can
and
therefore
should
and
must
be
given
effect.
now,
the
petitioners'
primary
argument,
however,
is
that
the
disclaimers
are
nothing
more
than
a
reservation
of
federal
authority
over
indians
and
their
lands,
and
that
congress
exercised
this
authority
when
it
enacted
mccarren,
but
this
is
contrary
to
what
the
disclaimers
say.
they
do
not
say
that
congress
reserves
authority.
they
say
that
indian
lands
shall
remain
subject
to
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states
until
they
are
revoked.
they
are
solemn
compacts
pledging
that
indians
and
their
lands
would
not
involuntarily
be
made
subject
to
coercive
state
jurisdiction
unless
congress
and
the
people
of
the
states
consent.
this
is
an
exercise
of
authority,
not
a
reservation,
and
the
disclaimers
have
been
so
applied
by
this
court
on
numerous
occasions.
the
state's
argument
also,
i
point
out,
flies
in
the
face
of
public
law
280,
in
which
congress
partially
repealed
the
disclaimers
because
they
were
viewed
as
legal
impediments
to
the
assumption
of
state
court
jurisdiction
over
indians.
now,
the
federal
government
takes
a
somewhat
different
tack
in
arguing
against
the
disclaimer.
it
objects
to
distinguishing
between
disclaimer
and
non-disclaimer
states
on
policy
grounds.
since
colorado
river
upheld
non-disclaimer
state
court
jurisdiction
over
indian
water
rights,
the
united
states
argues
that
the
same
rule
now
should
be
applied
to
disclaimer
states.
in
effect,
the
government
reads
the
colorado
river
decision
as
an
implied
sub
silentio
repeal
of
the
disclaimers.
the
obvious
response
is
that
the
disclaimers
are
duly
enacted
laws
of
the
united
states.
they
must
be
given
effect
unless
they
are
found
to
be
unconstitutional
or
impliedly
repealed,
and
the
government
does
not
even
attempt
to
show
that
the
standards
for
finding
an
implied
repeal
have
been
met.
congress
obviously
was
aware
that
states
admitted
after
1889
were
made
subject
to
different
laws
than
previously
admitted
states,
and
congress
has
frequently
applied
different
rules
to
indians
in
different
states.
there
is
neither
a
compelling
need
for
uniformity
nor
consistent
historical
practice
of--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--the
equal
footing
doctrine
only
prohibits
the
united
states
from
asserting
unique
conditions
on
statehood
that
congress
would
not
otherwise
have
authority
to
impose,
and
since
congress
has
plenary
and
full
authority
to
impose
virtually
any
condition
and
any
exercise,
any
authority
over
indians,
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
not
a
concern
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
i'm
sorry.
i
missed
the
beginning
of
your
question.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
there
is
no
question,
and
arizona
against
california
specifically
held
that
congress
has
full
authority
to
reserve
water
for
indian
reservations
pre-statehood
and
post-statehood,
and
there
is
a
full
range
of
court
decisions
which
hold...
winters
against
the
united
states
is
probably
the
leading
case
holding
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
does
not
prohibit
any
federal
legislation
dealing
with
indian
affairs
or
any
reservation
of
rights
for
indians.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
the
disclaimers
have
been
given
effect
by
this
court,
the
indian
disclaimers
have
been
given
effect
by
this
court
time
and
time
again,
in
williams
against
lee,
in
fisher
against
the
district
court,
in
mcclannahan
in
1973,
and
the
equal
footing
doctrine
under
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
46
to
47
is
just
not
a
factor
in
dealing
with
indian
affairs,
for
the
reasons
that
are
explained
in
those
cases.
now,
if
the
government
believes
that
disclaimer
and
non-disclaimer
states
should
be
treated
exactly
alike,
it
is
addressing
its
argument
to
the
wrong
institution.
congress
created
that
distinction,
and
it
is
for
congress,
not
this
court,
to
do
away
with
it,
and
indeed,
only
a
year
after
mccarren
was
enacted,
when
the
disclaimers
were
specifically
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress,
congress
did
exactly
that.
it
repealed
the
disclaimers
in
public
law
280
in
order
to
permit
disclaimer
state
courts
to
assume
limited
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indian
disputes
but
of
course
specifically
excluded
the
adjudication
of
indian
water
rights.
so,
what
both
the
petitioners
and
the
government's
position
have
in
common
that
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do
what
congress
has
never
done,
repeal
the
disclaimers
in
order
to
permit
state
court
adjudications
of
indian
water
rights.
since
effect,
though,
can
and
therefore
must
be
given
to
both
statutes,
we
submit
that
the
federal
courts
should
retain
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
indian
water
rights.
now,
turning
to
the
conflict
of
interest--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i
wasn't
planning
to,
but
i'll
be
glad
to.
organized
village
of
kake
against
egan,
i
think,
was
fully
distinguished
from
our
situation
by
this
court's
opinion
in
mcclannahan
which
pointed
out
that
kake
against
egan
does
not
provide
any
rules
or
guidelines
for
determining
the
relative
contours
of
state
jurisdiction
when
indian
reservations
are
involved.
that
was
an
off-reservation
case
that
was...
there
were
no
indian
reservations
involved
there,
and
that's
what
the
court
said
in
mcclannahan
in
dealing
with
kake
against
egan.
now,
in
colorado
river,
the
court...
i
am
dealing
now
with
the
conflict
of
interest
issue...
the
court
expressly
did
not
decide
"whether
dismissal
of
the
federal
suit
would
be
warranted
if
the
state
proceeding
were
in
some
respect
inadequate
to
resolve
the
indian
claims.
"
recently,
in
moses
h.
cohn
memorial
hospital
case,
this
court
elaborated
on
the
overriding
importance
of
this
inadequacy
criterion
in
cases
of
this
kind.
the
court
stated,
"when
a
district
court
decides
to
dismiss
or
stay
under
colorado
river,
it
presumably
concludes
that
the
parallel
state
court
litigation
will
be
an
adequate
vehicle
for
the
complete
and
prompt
resolution
of
the
issue
between
the
parties.
"
"if
there
is
any
substantial
doubt
as
to
this,
it
would
be
a
serious
abuse
of
discretion
to
grant
the
stay
or
to
dismiss
at
all.
"
in
this
case,
the
state
court
proceedings
are
unsatisfactory
and
inadequate
because
the
government
is
called
upon
to
represent
numerous
conflicting
interests,
and
therefore
cannot
adequately
represent
the
tribes'
interests.
as
a
result,
the
judgment
may
not
be
binding
on
the
tribes.
the
government's
evident
conflicts
were
recognized
by
the
ninth
circuit.
they
literally
litter
the
landscape.
to
take
one
example,
on
the
milk
river
in
montana,
the
united
states
claims
rights
to
water
for
the
glacier
national
park,
for
a
bureau
of
reclamation
project,
for
five
national
wildlife
refuges,
for
three
wildlife
production
areas,
for
two
military
reservations,
four
reservoirs,
and
in
addition
to
all
of
these
federal
proprietary
interests,
four
separate
indian
reservations.
now,
the
only
way
to
correct
this
obvious
problem,
to
remove
this
taint
from
the
state
court
proceedings,
to
avoid
this
inadequacy,
is
for
the
tribes
to
be
parties
to
the
adjudications
in
their
own
right,
represented
by
their
own
attorneys.
in
that
way,
their
interests
will
be
fully
and
fairly
represented,
and
the
resulting
judgment
will
not
be
subject
to
direct
or
collateral
attack
on--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--well,
that
remains
to
be
seen,
but
assuming
that--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--no--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i
do
not
assume
they
cannot.
it
would
be
a
question
of
whether
the
state
courts
allowed
them
to
intervene,
which
nobody
can
predict,
but
i
submit
the
ninth
circuit
considered
that
question
and
said
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
put
the
tribes
to
that
hobson's
choice.
i
point
out
that
congress
had
this
question
before
it
on
two
occasions.
when
the
mccarren
amendment
was
enacted,
congress
did
not
waive
the
tribes'
immunity.
congress
could
have
waived
the
tribes'
immunity
and
made
them
subject
to
suit
in
state
court,
but
did
not,
waived
only
the
government's
immunity.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
not
if
there
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
if
the
government
is...
if
the
government's
conflict
prevents
them
from
adequately
representing
the
indians'
interests,
and
the
indians
have
not
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
be
heard
owing
to
the
government's
conflict,
then
that
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process
that
would
cloud
the
resulting
judgment.
now,
the
second...
the
second
point
is
that--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--no,
that
is
an
inherent
attribute
of
sovereignty
that
was
reaffirmed
in
santa
clara
pueblo
against
martinez--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--that's
correct,
and
congress
in
1966,
when
it
enacted
28
usc
section
1362,
which
my
colleagues
will
be
talking
more
about,
specifically
recognized
the
existence
of
this
conflict
problem,
recognized
that
there
were
instances
when
the
attorney
general
would
not
be
able
to
represent
the
tribes'
interest
owing
to
the
conflict,
and
provided
a
federal
forum,
consciously
did
not
provide
a
state
forum
for
tribes
to
sue
under
those
circumstances
and
to
represent
its
own
interests.
so,
i
think
under
those
circumstances
the
ninth
circuit
was
quite
right
not
to
require
the
tribes
to
intervene
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
no,
i
agree
with
that
in
principle.
the
fact
is
that
the
tribes--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--yes,
it
is
where
the
tribes
have
participated
and
are
participating
in
the
federal
court,
because
the
problems
posed
by
the
conflict
do
not
exist
if
the
tribes
are
independently
represented.
they
are
in
the
federal
courts.
they
are
not
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
correct,
and
with
regard
to
those
cases,
the
conflict
factor
would
not
point
either
way,
but
it
would
be
decisive
where
the
tribes
are
participating
in
the
federal
court
but
are
not
participating
in
the
state
court--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
they
are
immune
from
suit,
and
that
in
these
circumstances--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--yes.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
and
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
put
them
to
the...
to
force
them
to
compel
their
immunity
by
intervening
in
federal
court,
particularly
when
congress
has
provided
a
federal
forum
for
them.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
yes,
but
there
is
a--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--well,
conflict
of
interest
shows
the
inadequacy
of
the
state
court
proceeding.
thank
you.
