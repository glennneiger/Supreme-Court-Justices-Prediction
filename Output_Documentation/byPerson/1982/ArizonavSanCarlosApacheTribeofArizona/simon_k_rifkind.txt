mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
my
argument
will
be
addressed
to
the
considerations
which
necessarily
must
underlie
the
argument
of
this
case
as
i
see
it,
and
that
is
a
discussion
of
the
factors
addressed
to
our
attention
in
the
akin
case,
the
case
that
we
have
all
decided
to
call
akin,
colorado
river
against...
but
i
should
like
to
open
with
this
one
sentence.
one
of
the
problems
of
a
consolidated
proceeding
of
this
kind
is
that
it
homogenizes
12
different
district
cases,
and
the
facts
do
not
always
fit
a
single
pattern.
i
should
therefore
like
to
deal
in
the
course
of
my
argument
with
the
facts
as
they
are
set
forth
in
the
navajo
case,
and
only
in
the
navajo
case,
because
i
think
that
gives
you
a
simple
structure
and
a
simple
situation.
now,
if
the
akin
case
leaves
room
for
any
indian
water
claim,
i
say
if,
then
this
is
the
case,
and
that
i
shall
try
to
demonstrate
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
as
i
listened
to
the
arguments
of
my
distinguished
friends
from
arizona
and
montana,
i
got
the
impression
that
they
never
will
find
a
case
under
akin
which
will
enable
an
indian
claim
to
remain
in
the
federal
court,
but
if
that
is
so,
then
the
statements
in
akin
which
proclaim
again
and
again
that
it
is
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
that
seems
to
be
turned
upside-down,
then
we
have
the
rule
of
abstention
set
forth
in
akin
become
the
universal
rule,
and
then
there
are
no
cases
which
are
outside
of
that.
that
i
cannot
accept.
now,
in
considering
akin,
i
want
to
deal
with
the
factors
involved,
and
one
of
them
is
history,
and
therefore,
to
the
extent
that
occasionally
i
overlap
the
argument
made
by
my
friend
who
just
preceded
me,
it
isn't
because
i
want
to
assert
the
disclaimer
argument.
i
simply
want
to
narrate
that
as
part
of
the
history
of
this
controversy.
the
navajo
nation,
whom
i
represent,
and
by
reason
of
the
consolidation
to
some
extent
i
speak
for
the
other
indian
tribes,
are
united
in
their
perception
that
the
choice
of
forum,
which
is
the
problem
before
us,
in
these
cases
is
critical
to
their
prosperity
in
future.
from
the
vigor
of
the
opposition
by
arizona
and
montana,
i
infer
that
they
regard
the
indians'
perception
is
correct.
this
common
perception
springs
from
a
long
history,
and
of
course
within
the
few
minutes
of
my
disposal
i
can
only
mention
a
few
points,
a
few
aspects
of
it.
after
years
of
warfare,
the
united
states
from
time
to
time
entered
into
treaties
with
the
indian
tribes.
i
can't
quote
them
all,
but
i
refer
you
to
the
apache
treaty
of
july
1,
1852,
the
navajo
treaty
of
1849,
and
the
source
of
my
claim
to
water,
the
particular
source
to
which
i
shall
advert,
the
navajo
treaty
of
1868.
and
the
common
aspect
of
these
treaties
is
that
the
indians
are
promised
by
this
great
nation,
and
i
quote
the
words,
"federal
jurisdiction
and
federal
protection".
one
sentence
out
of
the
1868
treaty
uses
that
language
a
little
bit
more
quaintly.
it
says,
"if
bad
men
among
the
whites
shall
commit
any
wrong
upon
the
person
or
property
of
the
indians,
the
united
states
will
proceed
at
once
to
cause
the
offender
to
be
arrested
and
punished
according
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
"
out
of
these
treaties
and
others
of
similar
import,
there
has
been
distilled
historically
a
national
policy,
first
enunciated
in
these
words
in
rice
against
olson
back
in
1945,
and
more
recently
in
the
mcclannahan
case
in
1973,
in
these
words:
"the
policy
of
leaving
indians
free
from
state
jurisdiction
and
control
is
deeply
rooted
in
the
nation's
history.
"
and
i
say
that
that
is
a
factor
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
engaging
in
the
weighing
process
that
akin
instructs
us
to
undertake.
the
navajos,
for
whom
i
speak,
never
agreed
to
subject
themselves
or
their
property
to
the
jurisdiction
or
laws
of
any
state,
and
so
the
united
states
understood.
they
understood
that
that
was
their
treaty
arrangements
with
the
navajos,
and
in
order
to
keep
its
promise
to
the
indians,
and
to
put
the
matter
beyond
dispute,
the
united
states
congress
in
1910,
before
admitting
the
state
of
arizona
to
the
union,
exacted
a
promise
from
the
people
of
that
state
that
they
would
forever
disclaim,
and
so
forth,
as
you
have
heard
from
my
friend,
mr.
pelcyger.
the
most
recent
step
taken
by
the
congress
consistent
with
this
united
states
promise
to
the
indians,
was
the
enactment
in
1966
of
section
1362
of
article
28
to
the
code
conferring
direct
access
upon
the
indian
tribes
to
the
federal
forum.
in
the
light
of
this
history,
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
the
navajos
turned
to
the
federal
court
when
they
filed
their
complaint
for
a
declaration
of
their
federal
rights
only
to
the
waters
of
the
little
colorado
and
for
a
quantification
of
those
rights
under
the
doctrines
of
the
winters
case
and
the
more
recent
case
of
california
against
arizona.
now,
the
navajos
filed
this
complaint
in
the
district
court
of
airzona
on
the
17th
of
april,
1979.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
statute
for
stream
adjudication
in
the
state
of
arizona.
that
was
enacted
a
little
later,
april
24th,
1979,
but
i
lay
no
stress
upon
that
time
factor.
i
regard
it
as
without
significance.
but
i
do
stress
that
the
navajos'
complaint
is
very
narrowly
focused.
i
quite
agree
with
the
gentleman
from
montana.
it
is
very
narrowly
focused.
it
asks
for
a
declaration
of
the
rights
to
the
waters
of
the
little
colorado
as
determined
by
its
treaty
with
the
united
states
and
as
interpreted
in
winters
and
arizona.
such
a
declaration
is
sought
against
everyone,
but
it
asks
no
determination
of
the
rights
of
all
the
users
of
the
colorado
river
inter
sese.
once
its
rights
have
been
determined
and
declared,
then
there
is
a
provision
in
the
arizona
water
statute
which
says
that
you
can
take
this
decree
and
enfold
it
into
the
arizona
decree
in
its
proper
hierarchy
of
rights
of
all
the
other
users.
so
that
as
a
practical
matter...
as
my
time
is
running
out
very
fast...
it
is...
avoids
any
possibility
of
competition
between
the
two
proceedings.
there
is
no
duplication,
and
even
if
the
matter
were
all
in
the
state
courts,
you
would
find
that
the
indian
water
rights,
since
it
is
derived
from
an
entirely
different
set
of
principles,
utterly
unrelated
to
appropriation,
utterly
unrelated
to
beneficial
use,
utterly
unrelated
to
any
of
those
factors
which
determine
rights
in
arizona
for
private
users--
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
--it
would
of
course
be
related
to
the
water...
quantity
of
waters
in
the
stream,
but
in
the
most
generalized
sense
of
that
term
only,
not
because
some
other
user
is
applying
it
beneficially
to
his
property.
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
this,
that
if
this
case,
indian
and
non-indian
rights,
were
tried
in
one
court,
you
would
find
that
the
indian
claim
would
have
to
be
encapsulated
in
a
separate
proceeding
and
treated
separately
as
in
fact
has
been
done
in
quite
a
number
of
proceedings
which
have
already
taken
place,
because
the
two
don't
mingle,
and
that's
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
there
is
no
duplication,
there
is
no
possibility
of
conflicting
decision,
there
is
no
piecemealing
in
the
sense
in
which
the
term
is
used
in
the
akin
case.
it
is
more
like
a
bifurcation
of
a
case,
say,
under
the
antitrust
laws,
where
you
have--
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
united
states--
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
--that
is
correct.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
the
united
states,
through
the
act
of
its
congress,
acquiesced
in
such
an
arrangement.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
the
indians
never
acquiesced
in
such
an
arrangement.
they
hold
a
promise
from
this
great
nation,
and
they
want
that
promise
performed.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
oh,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
if
the
state
brings
a
proceeding?
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
i
do
not
say
the
contrary.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
if
arizona
brings
an
action
for
stream
adjudication
and
the
indians
don't
do
anything,
and
they
bring
in
the
indian
claims
by
serving
the
united
states,
then
akin
would
say
that
can
go
on
in
the
state
court.
i
have
no
question--
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
--oh,
i
have
no
doubt
of
it.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
yes.
i
am
simply
saying
that
it
does
not
generate
the
kind
of
conflict
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
akin
case
when
we
were
weighing
two
parallel
proceedings.
in
that
case,
the
united
states
started
a
general
stream
adjudication,
the
states
started
a...
there
were
two
wasteful
proceedings
both
moving
towards
the
same
target.
obviously,
there
was
going
to
be
a
collision
at
the
end
of
that
terminal.
somewheres
those
two
trains
would
come
together,
and
there
would
be
a
crash.
no
such
thing
can
happen
here.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
well,
all
i--
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
--i
apprehended
that
you
might
ask
me
that
question,
and
therefore
i
found
out
the
answer
from
among
my
colleagues.
we
are
still
in
the
pleading
stage.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
nothing
has
happened
beyond
the
pleading
stage.
0
[generallaughter.]
and
i
can
say
to
this
court
that
all
these
gentlemen
representing
the
indians
are
quite
happy
to
adjust
their
pleadings
to
such
form
as
this
court
will
find
agreeable
in
order
to
ensure
their
safe
residence
within
a
federal
forum.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
there
is
no
conflict
in
the
system
that
i
have
described.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
justice
white,
if
you
say
that
the
navajo
plan,
the
complaint
that
i
worked
out
in
navajo,
which
i
did
with
both
my
eyes
focused
on
the
akin
case,
and
i
made
sure
that
i
never
trespassed
one
foot
inside
that
territory,
and
i
did
it
with
eyes
open,
and
i
have
accomplished
it,
i
believe,
and
having
done
that,
then
the
others
can
accommodate
themselves
to
the
same
kind
of
a
complaint
that
will
be
safe
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
i
would
be...
i
am
just--
mr.
simon
k.
rifkind
--i
am
not
here
to
ask
you
to
revisit
akin.
i
wouldn't
mind
if
akin
was
overruled.
i
can
live
with
it.
