mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
we
have
asked
ourselves
in
respect
of
these
cases
is
whether
it
is
unavoidable
to
have
an
all
or
nothing
solution
to
have
water
rights
adjudication,
indian,
non-indian,
federal,
all
in
the
state
court
or
all
in
the
federal
court,
as
indeed
akin
suggests
must
be
the
result.
it
has
seemed
to
us,
after
some
years
of
experience
under
akin,
we
ask
the
court
to
revisit
only
that
aspect
of
the
akin
holding.
it
is
that
it
is
indeed
possible,
practical,
and
desirable
to
divide
the
task
between
the
federal
and
state
courts.
it
is
cooperative
federalism
to
attempt
that
if
it
can
be
done
consistently
with
the
statutes
and
consistently
with
practical
realities.
it
is
the
way
of
attempting
to
reconcile
and
accommodate
apparently
conflicting
indications
from
the
congress.
and
it
seems
to
us
not
to
present
the
problems
that
what
apparently
were
in
the
forefront
of
the
court's
mind
when
it
decided
akin.
it
seems
to
us
there
is
no
duplication,
there
is
no
prospect
of
conflict,
there
is
no
wasted
judicial
resource.
on
the
contrary,
there
can
be,
and
once
the
lines
are
clearly
drawn,
hopefully
will
be
a
cooperation
between
the
two
court
systems.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
know
whether
your
question
suggests
that
either
decree
will
adjudicate
more
water
than
is
available.
i
don't
think
that
specter
has
been
put
forward.
if
not--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--justice
o'connor,
all
we
suggest
the
task
of
the
federal
court
will
be
is
simply
to
determine
adversely
to
all
those
who
want
to
contest
it
in
the
federal
court
forum
the
number
of
acre
feet
of
water
to
which
indian
reservations
are
entitled
and
the
priority
date
appropriate.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
only
to
the
extent
that
the
number
of
acre
feet
which
a
river
bed
bore
might
be
greater,
computing
so
many
acre
feet
per
acre
for
each
acre
than
is
available.
otherwise,
the
federal
court
simply
says,
and
there
may
be
earlier
priorities...
of
course,
that
would
have
to
give
way...
the
federal
court
merely
makes
the
determination
that
assuming
enough
water
is
available,
the
reservation
is
entitled
to
so
many
acre
feet
per
year.
that
is
all
and
as
far
as
the
federal
court
goes.
the
state
court
in
its
comprehensive
adjudication
takes
that
decree
and
places
it
in
the
proper
sequence.
if
there
is
an
earlier
priority
date,
it
must
be
satisfied
before
the
reservation
claim.
more
usually,
the
reservation
claim
will
be
an
earlier
one,
and
the
adjudicated
claims
for
others
will
come
afterwards.
the
state
decree
at
the
end
of
the
day
will
be
comprehensive
and
will
include
this
determination,
this
quantification
accomplished
by
the
federal
court.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
indeed
the
way
in
which
state
proceedings
have
proceeded
when
it
is
all
in
the
state
court.
we
cite
the
wyoming
example.
there,
the
water
master
quite
reasonably,
it
seems
to
us,
and
almost
inevitably,
determined
first
the
federal
indian
reserve
claims
with
a
view
to
incorporating
that
in
his
ultimate
decree.
he
did
that
by
inviting
all
those
who
wished
to
contest
it
to
appear.
very
few
did.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
the
date,
justice
white,
and
of
course
that
may
be--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
take
it
that
in
the
western
states
there
is
no
dispute,
the
trust
in
right...
first
in
time
is
first
in
right,
and
i
don't
think
this
is--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--i
think
my
answer
is
yes.
the
date
is
normally
not
a
matter
of
great
dispute.
at
least
it
has
been
the
indication
from
this
court
that
the
priority
date...
arizona
versus
california,
most
notably...
is
the
date
on
which
congress
or
the
executive--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
united
states
itself
will
be
a
party
to
the
state
decree.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--we
have
in
effect
answered
the
motion
in
the
letter
we
sent
to
the--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--that
is
so,
mr.
justice--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--that
is
to
say
that
in
the
absence
of
any
intervention
by
the
tribe,
it
is
the
power
and
duty
of
the
united
states
to
represent
indian
claims,
whether
the
tribe
wishes
it
or
not,
and
so
to
that
degree
we
are
here.
we
cannot
default
and
say
the
blackfeet
tribe
are
unrepresented.
the
reasons
why
it
is
appropriate
for
the
federal
court
to
adjudicate
the
federal
indian
rights
which
are
for
federal
water
determined
in
accordance
with
federal
law
principles
are
too
obvious
to
need
elaboration
if
the
mccarren
amendment
did
not
make
that
solution
impossible.
the
akin
decision
was
at
pains
to
point
out
that
federal
jurisdiction
over
water
claims
was
not
in
any
way
diminished
by
the
passage
of
that
legislation,
and
accordingly,
as
my
brother,
judge
rifkind,
pointed
out,
if
the
reservation
of
that
federal
jurisdiction
was
to
be
meaningful,
it
must
apply
in
at
least
some
cases.
if
these
cases,
particularly
the
montana
cases,
in
which
the
claims
were
filed
in
federal
court
almost
five
years
before
the
state
in
its
leisurely
way
prepared
itself
to
begin
an
adjudication,
and
the
federal
court
effectively
sat
on
those
complaints
for
that
length
of
time,
do
not
satisfy
the
akin
factors,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
one
that
does.
now,
we
have
urged
the
court
to
draw
a
clearer
line
only
because
the
jurisdictional
skirmishing
that
has
ensued
from
the
decision
seems
to
us
extremely
wasteful
and
acrimonious.
there
is
an
ingredient
in
this
case
that
was
not
present
in
akin,
and
it
is
one
of
some
importance,
it
seems
to
us.
it
is
the
congressionally
granted
prerogative
to
indian
tribes
to
invoke
the
federal
forum
and
very
pointedly
the
federal
forum
under
section
1362
of
the
judicial
code,
and
to
do
so
in
their
own
name.
regardless
of
any
conflict
of
interest,
it
is
desirable
to
attempt
to
accommodate
that
congressional
directive,
the
availability
of
a
federal
court
to
the
indian
claims,
with
the
policy
of
the
mccarren
amendment,
if
that
can
be
done.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
can
indeed
be
done,
and
at
least
when
the
tribes
invoke
that
jurisdictional
base
as
they
have
in
all
of
the
arizona
cases,
and
as
they
have
in
most
of
the
montana
cases,
by
intervening,
that
choice
should
be
respected,
and
it
is
a
choice
which
respects
the
congressional
judgment
that
indian
claims
are
more
appropriately
adjudicated
in
the
federal
court.
and
that
can
live
together
with
the
concerns
of
the
mccarren
amendment,
which
are
to
avoid
a
situation
in
which
a
tribe
or
the
united
states
stands
aloof,
refusing
to
participate
in
the
adjudication
of
its
water
rights
in
any
forum.
but
we
say
that
so
long
as
by
a
joint
effort
of
state
and
federal
courts
all
of
the
rights
in
the
stream
can
be
adjudicated
contemporaneously--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--there
were
claims
of
the
united
states,
not
on
behalf
of--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--we
say
they
were.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
under
colorado
river--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--yes.
well,
we
are
content
whether
we
would
be
entitled
to
resist
that
referral
to
the
state
court
to
say
that
the
special
reasons
for
preserving
the
federal
jurisdiction
of
indian
claims
most
obviously
indicated
in
the
reservation
of
water
rights
in
public
law
280
and
section
1362--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--the
akin
court
was
not,
at
least
at
the
instance
of
the
united
states,
invited
to
focus
on
the
special
situation
under
the
acts
of
congress
for
indian
claims,
most
specifically,
section
1362.
here
we
have,
as
was
not
true
in
akin,
tribes
invoking
what
congress
gave
them,
a
right
of
entry
to
the
federal
court,
and
it
would
be
a
meaningless
gift
it
can
be
taken
away
from
them
by
the
expedience
of
suing
the
united
states
in
state
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
must
candidly
concede
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
reconsider
one
aspect
of
akin
in
light
of
section
1362,
not
involved
there,
and
that
the
experience
under
akin
has
led
us
to
invite
the
court
to
draw
a
firmer
line.
we
do
point
out
that
the
federal
courts
would...
the
state
courts
would
nevertheless,
as
they
did
in
the
wyoming
case,
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
indian
claims
if
neither
the
united
states
nor
the
tribe
invoke
in
a
timely
way
its
prerogative
to
remain
in--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--we
invite
the
court
to
that
result,
though
we
likewise
endorse
the
intermediate
position
put
forward
by
judge
rifkind.
all
right.
