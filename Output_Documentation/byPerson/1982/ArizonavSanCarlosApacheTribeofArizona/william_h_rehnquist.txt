could
one
seek
that
in
a
federal
court
in
arizona?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
would
be
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
a
statewide
or
streamwide
adjudication?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
greely,
is
montana
drained
entirely
into
the
mississippi
by
the
missouri
river,
or
does
anything
go
over
to
the
pacific?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
goes
into
columbia.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
greely?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
go
back
just
a
moment
to
the
ninth
circuit's
discussion
of
comprehensiveness.
i
was
just
reading
over
those
two
paragraphs
in
their
opinion,
and
as
i
read
the...
it
doesn't
really
decide
the
question
of
comprehensiveness.
or
am
i
wrong?
it
specifies
the
factors,
states
the
arguments
of
montana,
states
the
arguments
of
the
tribes,
and
then
say,
"the
tribes
correctly
stress
that
akin
only
required
dismissal
where
the
federal
proceeding
would
be
piecemeal
and
the
state
proceeding
is
comprehensive.
"
"where
that
is
not
the
case
and
jurisdictions
concur,
the
federal
court
may
not
abdicate
its
judicial
obligations.
"
which
is
simply
a
statement
of
the
rule
in
akin.
then
they
go
on
to
talk
about
the
race
to
the
court,
forum
non
conveniens.
do
you
think
they
decided
comprehensiveness
as
a
separate
inquiry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
in
those
two
paragraphs
said
that
the
montana
proceeding
was
not
comprehensive?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
0....
well,
i
don't
mean
to
hold
you
up.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
equal
footing
clause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
pollard
against
hagen,
the
objection
was
not
that
congress
didn't
have
authority
in
the
abstract
to
reserve
water
out
of
its
own
territory
that
was
making
a
state,
but
that
it
hadn't
done
it
with
the
other
states.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
pollard
against
hagen,
which
i
think
is
the
leaving
equal
footing
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
that
was
not
addressed
to
this
kind
of
a
disclaimer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
going
to
discuss
organized
village
of
kake
in
your
oral
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
far
as
worrying
about
collateral
attack,
doesn't
the
heckman
case
pretty
well
take
care
of
that?
the
tribes
are
bound
by
the
united
states
representation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nothing
you
have
told
me
so
far
suggests
a
denial
of
due
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
i
take
it...
i
take
it--
--well,
you
want
to
overturn
winter.
you
want
to
overturn
akin.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
confronted
with
a
claim
under
a
disclaimer
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
with
a
disclaimer...
i
mean,
say
the
washington
cases,
the
new
mexico
cases,
mescalero,
that
you
are
referring
to.
was
that
statement
by
the
court
that
you
quote
made
in
the
context
of
the
disclaimer
provision
in
the
state's
constitution
being
argued?
