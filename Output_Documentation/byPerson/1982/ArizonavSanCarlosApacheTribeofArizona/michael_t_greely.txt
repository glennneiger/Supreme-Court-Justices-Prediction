mr.
michael
t.
greely
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
briefly
describe
the
procedural
postures
of
these
cases
in
the
state
of
montana,
first
in
the
federal
court
and
then
the
state
situation.
there
were
seven
cases
filed
in
federal
district
court,
six
by
the
united
states
and
one
by
the
northern
cheyenne
tribe.
in
january,
'75,
the
northern
cheyenne
named
21
defendants
and
100
john
does
in
their
action.
the
six
united
states
suits
were
filed
at
the
request
of
the
tribes,
including
the
northern
cheyenne
tribe.
in
march
of
'75,
the
united
states,
at
the
request
of
the
northern
cheyenne
tribe,
named
24
defendants
and
asked
for
adjudication
of
all
federal
and
indian
reserve
water
rights
on
the
tongue
river.
in
april
of
'75,
the
united
states,
at
the
request
of
the
crow
tribe,
named
several
hundred
defendants
on
the
big
horn
river.
the
four
remaining
suits
were
all
filed
in
1979,
and
they
involved
the
flathead
river
and
the
northern
tributaries
to
the
missouri
river
but
not
the
missouri
river
itself,
and
these
suits
were
also
filed
at
the
behest
of
the
tribes.
there
has
been
virtually
no
progress
in
any
of
these
federal
cases,
and
all
seven
of
these
cases
were
dismissed
by
the
federal
district
court
in
montana
in
1979
based
on
the
akin
factors.
now,
this
is
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
situation
in
montana's
state
courts.
montana's
state
adjudication
has
been
moving
very
rapidly.
in
1979,
pursuant
to
state
law,
a
statewide
adjudication
began
with
regard
to
all
water
rights
in
the
state
of
montana.
special
water
courts
were
established
and
funded
by
the
montana
legislature--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--well,
it
is
considered
to
be
one
court.
there
are
four
divisions.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that
is
correct.
the
united
states
was
served
as
trustee
in
the
state
proceeding
as...
on
its...
for...
on
behalf
of
the
indian
water
rights
in
its
own
capacity.
by
april
30th
of
1982,
over
200,000
claims
to
water
rights
in
the
states
had
been
filed
in
the
state
courts,
and
anyone
who
had
not
filed
by
that
date
in
the
state
of
montana
are
presumed
to
have
abandoned
their
claims.
thirty-five
thousand
of
those
claims,
of
the
200,000,
were
filed
by
the
united
states
on
their
own
behalf
and
on
behalf
of
the
various
tribes,
including
the
tribes
involved
in
this
case.
the
water
courts
are--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--yes,
they
duplicate
the
suits
that
are
involved
in
this
case
in
the
federal
courts.
obviously,
the
state
proceeding
is
comprehensive
statewide;
the
federal
cases
involve
certain
river
drainages.
the
water
courts
are
in
the
process
right
now
of
gathering
evidence,
and
preliminary
decrees
in
those
cases
will
be
issued
as
soon
as
possible.
now,
unlike
the
situation
in
arizona--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--there's
a
few...
we
have
the
continental
divide
that
goes
through
the
state,
so
some
of
that
is
drained
into
the
columbia
river
system.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
unlike
montana,
the
state
adjudication
has
not
been
stayed
pending
this...
pending
this
proceeding,
and
the
montana
water
courts
of
course
have
relied
on
the
mccarren
amendment
and
the
colorado
river
decision
to
proceed
with
their
adjudication.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
there
was
an
effort,
i
believe,
on
behalf
of
one
of
the
tribes
to
stay
the
proceedings.
that
motion
was...
i
believe
it
was
in
federal
court
in
missoula,
and
i
think
it
was
agreed
that
the
federal
district
judge
would
not
stay...
try
to
stay
the
state
proceedings
pending
the
decision
of
this
case.
now,
in
preparation
for
my
oral
argument
today,
i
decided
to
listen
to
the
tape
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
colorado
river
decision,
and
i
found
it
to
be
quite
interesting,
because
i
had
kind
of
thought
that
there
wasn't
that
much
discussion
of
indian
rights.
i
thought
the
discussion
in
that
case
before
the
court
in
oral
argument
concentrated
on
keeping
the
federal
reserved
rights
in
federal
court.
but
much
to
my
surprise,
over
50
percent
of
the
argument
that
was
presented
by
the
solicitor's
office,
mr.
shapiro,
involved
indian
water
rights,
and
many
of
the
questions
that
this
court
raised
involved
indian
rights.
the
question
that
appeared
in
oral
argument
was
whether
indian
rights,
reserved
water
rights
should
be
adjudicated
in
state
court.
and
the
arguments
in
that
case
echo
very
much
the
briefs
of
the
indian
tribes
and
the
united
states
in
this
case.
it
is
interesting,
and
i
have
the
brief
here
from
the
colorado
river
case,
and
obviously
i
am
not
going
to
read
it
to
you
or
read
great
detail
from
it,
but
it
is...
just
to
give
you
an
idea,
with
the
indulgence,
let
me
just
read
a
couple
of
the
headings
here.
"determination
of
indian
and
federal
water
claims
in
federal
court
will
not
interfere
with
state
proceedings.
"
"important
practical
benefits
result
from
water
rights
suits
by
the
united
states
in
federal
courts.
"
"federal
decrees
can
easily
be
integrated
into
colorado's
general
adjudication.
"
"federal
courts
alone
have
jurisdiction
over
claims
for
determination
of
indian
water
rights.
"
now,
the
only
reason...
the
only
difference
i
see
between
that
language
and
the
language
in
the
solicitor's
brief
today
is
that
they
used
the
term
"integrated"
in
that
brief,
that
the
rights
would
be
integrated
in
the
state
proceedings,
and
the
terminology
that
has
been
used
here
is
"plugging
in".
now,
this
court
rejected
all
those
arguments
in
the
colorado
river
decision,
and
we
are
dealing
with
the
same
statute,
the
mccarren
amendment,
and
this
court
has
interpreted
that
in
colorado
river,
and
seven
years
after
the
decision
in
1976
in
colorado
river,
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
amend
that
provision.
i
think
it
might
also
be
important,
if
i
may,
to
examine
the
proposal
of
the
solicitor
in
this
case,
the
proposal
that
the
indian
rights
somehow
can
be
adjudicated
separately
in
a
federal
court
proceeding
while
all
the
other
rights
are
adjudicated
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
this,
of
course,
was
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
colorado
river,
and
this
court
has
held,
as
mr.
kyl
referred
to
in
the
cohn
case,
that
clear
federal
policy
of
avoiding
piecemeal
adjudications
of
water
rights
in
the
river
system
are
concerned,
and
there
is
a
preference
for
a
unitary
and
comprehensive
proceeding
in
the
state
court.
and
there
is
good
reason,
and
let
me
suggest
the
nightmare
that
may
occur
in
montana
should
we
have
any
kind
of
a
concurrent
proceeding
in
that
state
ongoing
in
the
same
river
drainages
as
the
comprehensive
proceeding
for
state
water
rights.
and
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
the...
the
government
says
in
its
brief
that
it,
if
course,
if
this
court
would
hold
that
indian
rights
could
be
done
in
federal
court,
it
will
go
back
and
amend
its
complaint,
and
of
course
it
would
have
to
amend
its
complaint
to
put
that
plug-in
plan
into
effect.
under
the
federal
rules,
of
course,
they
would
have
to
file
a
motion
to
amend,
and
in
the
federal
cases
there
are
approximately
9,000
defendants,
and
they
would
have
to
be
served,
and
some
of
those
defendants
may
oppose
the
motion,
some
of
them
may
consent
to
it,
and
some
of
them
might
not
even
respond,
and
then
there
would
be
hearings
on
those
motions,
and
if
the
motion
were
granted,
then
the
new
complaints
would
have
to
be
filed,
and
those
would
have
to
be
served,
and
really
the
question
is,
who
would
be
the
defendants
in
those
federal
case
proceedings
when
they
are
supposedly
just
adjudicating
indian
rights?
well,
the
answer
is,
in
a
comprehensive
water
adjudication
everybody
would
have
to
be
a
defendant,
whether
they
had
a
state
right,
a
federal
right,
a
federal
reserved
right,
or
an
indian
water
right,
if...
that
is,
if
that
decree
were
to
be
binding
on
all
the
parties.
and
the
purpose
for
all
of
this,
the
government
suggests,
is
that
the
federal
courts
are
the
judicial
forum
or
the
preferred
forum
for
determining
indian
water
rights,
and
colorado
river
clearly
answered
this
argument
by
saying
that
the
indian
rights
can
be
adjudicated
in
state
court
just
as
easily
and
maybe
more
easily
than
in
federal
court.
now,
there
is
one
other
issue
that
may
possibly
trouble
the
court,
and
this
issue
i
don't
believe
was
discussed
or
brought
up
in
the
colorado
river
decision,
and
this
is
the
issue
that
apparently
gave
some
trouble
to
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that
was
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
between
the
tribes
and
the
united
states
which
apparently
occurred
for
the
first
time
at
the
ninth
circuit
level.
i
don't
know
that
the
issue
was
addressed.
it
wasn't
addressed
by
the
federal
district
judges
of
montana
when
they
dismissed
in
favor
of
the
state
proceedings
on
the
grounds
of
colorado
river
and
mccarren.
and
of
course
as
i
understand,
the
government's
position
is
that
they
don't
recognize
any
conflict
of
interest
in
this
case
or
in
any
of
these
cases,
to
my
knowledge,
that
are
consolidated
here
on
appeal.
apparently,
the
argument,
and
this
is
the
argument
that
is
made
by
the
tribes,
is
that
the
u.s.
should
not
be
representing
the
tribes
with
regard
to
their
reserved
indian
water
rights
because
the
u.s.
may
have
some
federal
reserve
water
rights
that
may
be
in
conflict
with
the
tribes'
rights
if
they
occur
in
the
same
adjudication
process.
of
course,
that
was
the
exact
situation
that
existed
in
the
colorado
case.
the
united
states
in
that
case
was
suing
on
its
own
behalf
for
water
rights.
i
forget
the
name
of
the
forest
on
the
san
juan
river.
and
the
indian
tribes
were
also
involved.
their
water
rights
were
also
involved
in
that
case.
the
united
states,
while
not
recognizing
any
conflict
of
interest,
say
that
of
course
they
are
the
trustee
for
the
tribe,
and
as
trustee
they
have
a
special
obligation
to
protect
those
rights.
in
fact,
in
the
cases
in
montana,
the
tribal
rights
come
first
in
the
order
of
complaint.
it
doesn't
appear
that
there
is
any
problem
with
that
in
the
state
of
montana,
but--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--there
have...
i
think
there's
one
or
two
tribes,
your
honor,
that
have
filed
claims
on
their
own
behalf
as
tribes.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
yes,
they
are.
encouraged
to.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
they
are...
they
are
a
part
of
one
of
the...
one
of
the
1979
suits
filed
by
the
united
states
on
their
behalf,
but
they
are
not
a
part
of
the
state
proceedings,
other
than...
other
than
the
rights
that
they
have
under
the
united
states
trusteeship.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
of
the
akin
factors.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
is
comprehensive?
mr.
michael
t.
greely
i
would
think
so.
there
are
the
factors
that
i
have
even
suggested
on
argument,
the
fact
that
if
you
have
concurrent
lawsuits,
concurrent
suits,
one
in
the
federal
court,
one
in
the
state
court,
all
the
defendants
in
both
suits
will
have
to
participate
in
both
of
those
suits.
so
there
will
be
a
piecemeal
adjudication.
you
will
have
everybody
in
the
federal
court
doing
one
thing
in
adjudicating
the
indian
rights,
and
then
in
the
state
court
you
will
have
them
adjudicating
everything
except
indian
rights.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
no,
because
the
state
proceeding
is
much...
much
more
comprehensive.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
the
state
proceeding
is
comprehensive
because
it
joins
everybody
on
that
stream,
all
the
rights
on
that
stream.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
they
were
suggesting
that
indian
lotie
claims
would
be
excluded,
but--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--the
united
states
would
represent
those.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
they
mentioned
that
our
state
law
talks
about
stock
water,
which
we
consider
to
be
a
de
minimis
right.
i
mean,
stock
water,
if
a
person
is
living
on
a
stream
and
his
stock
drinks
out
of
that
stream,
he
doesn't
have...
he
is
not
required...
he
may
file
voluntarily.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
no,
it
is
not
riparian,
your
honor,
because
in
montana
he
has
the
process
of
adjudication.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
it
is
similar
to
a
riparian
right.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
no.
no,
but
if
you
were
to...
if
you
were
to
divert
water
for
the
purpose,
or
impound
water
for
stock
purposes,
then
you
would
have
to.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
right.
and
domestic
uses,
your
honor,
also
are
excluded.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
that's
correct.
i
will
just
finish
up
on
the
point
i
was
making
on
the
conflicts.
the
united
states
represents
the
indian
tribes
as
trustee
for
the
water
rights,
and
the
indians
are...
the
indian
tribes--
mr.
michael
t.
greely
--yes.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
i
think
they
have
considered...
see,
the
federal
court
in
montana
said
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
dismissing
in
deference
to
state
court
was
that
our...
the
federal
district
court
found
that
our
state
proceedings
were
comprehensive.
in
fact,
they
even
cite
in
their
opinion
bits
of
our
water
law
and
how
our
process
takes
place.
i
believe
that
the...
first
of
all,
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
in
this
discussion
of
comprehensiveness,
but
it
is
only
one
of
the
many
factors
that
would
occur
in
the
colorado
river.
mr.
michael
t.
greely
where
do
i
see
that
it
says
it
was
not
comprehensive?
mr.
michael
t.
greely
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
recall
reading
that
paragraph
where
the
ninth
circuit
discussed
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
federal
proceeding
and
the
state
proceeding.
i
frankly
disagreed
with
some
of
the
statements.
i
think
if
you
look
at
our
brief,
and
i
am
not
sure
if
i
have
the
page
number...
i
don't
believe
i
can
cite
you
the
page
number
of
our
brief,
but
it
does
discuss
some
of
the
errors
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
opinion...
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
as
to
what
the
status
of
those
proceedings
were.
thank
you.
