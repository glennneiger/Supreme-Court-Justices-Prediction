mr.
jon
l.
kyl
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
during
the
floor
debate
on
the
mccarren
amendment,
senator
mccarren
stated
to
senator
ernest
mcfarland,
"let
me
say
to
the
senator
from
arizona
that
there
is
no
state
in
the
union
more
interested
in
this
bill
than
is
the
state
of
arizona.
"
"in
fact,
all
of
the
western
arid
and
semi-arid
states
are
interested
in
this
bill.
"
of
course,
the
reason
senator
mccarren
believed
that
the
state
of
arizona
was
interested
in
his
bill
is
because
as
its
sponsor
he
understood
that
the
state
of
arizona
could
utilize
his
bill
for
the
adjudication
of
water
rights,
and
yet
we
are
before
this
court
30
years
later
arguing
about
whether
the
mccarren
amendment
applies
to
the
courts
of
arizona
as
well
as
the
other
western
states.
these
consolidated
cases
come
to
this
court
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit,
five
cases
from
arizona
and
seven
cases
from
montana.
in
arizona,
state
general
water
adjudications
had
been
filed
on
the
five
major
river
systems
in
the
state.
within
a
month
after
service
of
process
on
some
12,000
defendants
on
the
salt
river
adjudication,
five
arizona
tribes
filed
separate
actions
for
removal
petitions
in
federal
court,
all
on
the
same
day,
to
enjoin
any
determination
of
their
rights.
these
were
not
suits
to
adjudicate
water
rights,
but
rather
suits
to
prevent
any
adjudication
of
their
rights.
six
weeks
later,
two
other
tribes
and
one
in
the
first
group
filed
separate
federal
suits
to
determine
their
rights
only.
none
of
the
federal
tribal
actions
in
arizona
have
sought
a
general
adjudication
of
water
rights.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
one
could
seek
that
in
a
federal
court
in
any
state,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
none
of
the
tribes,
and
the
united
states
has
not,
none
of
the
tribes
have
sought
such
an
adjudication
in
the
federal
courts
in
the
state
of
arizona,
and
no
party
disputes
that.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
this
court
held
in
the
colorado
river
case
that
either
under
section
1345
or...
well,
section
1345
in
that
case,
that
a
suit
could
be
filed
in
the
federal
court
for
adjudication
of
water
rights.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
for
a
streamwide
adjudication,
yes.
and
of
course
the
court
in
colorado
river
held
that
the
considerations
of
wise
judicial
administration
that
would
be
applied
by
the
court
would
determine
whether
the
adjudication
could
go
forward
in
the
federal
court
or
in
the
state
court
if
there
were
concurrent
proceedings
and
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
key
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
that
there
there
were
general
adjudications
filed
in
federal
court.
here,
there
are
none.
in
the
state
adjudication
proceedings
that
were
in
the
meantime
proceeding
in
arizona
on
just
the
river
systems
which
are
before
this
court,
over
100,000
potential
defendants
were
identified.
over
70,000
have
been
personally
served.
claims
have
been
filed,
almost
7,000
separate
claims,
approximately
one-third
of
them
by
the
united
states
itself,
and
over
$2
million
has
been
appropriated
to
the
department
of
water
resources
to
assist
the
courts
in
arizona
to
determine
these
claims.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
mr.
chief
justice,
those
are
among
the
factors,
the
considerations--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--simply
to
illustrate,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
significant
progress
and
involvement
in
the
arizona
state
court
proceedings.
if
there
were
federal
court
general
adjudications
pending,
the
court
would
under
the
colorado
river
balancing
determine
which
court
to
send
the
adjudication
to.
here
there
are
no
federal
court
adjudications,
but
i
mention
it
to
illustrate
the
fact
that
the
arizona
proceedings
are
viable
and
are
proceeding
and
involve
a
tremendous
number
of
claims
by
people
on
five
different
water
systems.
the
tribal
actions
were
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
were
argued
in
conjunction
with
the
seven
cases
from
montana.
my
co-counsel,
general
greely,
will
discuss
the
procedural
history
of
the
montana
cases.
a
divided
three-judge
ninth
circuit
court
reversed
the
montana
and
arizona
cases,
holding
that
the
enabling
act
and
constitutional
disclaimers
of
arizona
and
montana
constituted
a
bar
from
those
states
adjudicating
water
rights
held
in
trust
for
the
tribes
by
the
united
states
unless
the
states
had
accepted
public
law
280
jurisdiction.
most,
if
not
all,
of
the
parties
here
agree
that
public
law
280
jurisdiction
is
irrelevant
to
these
cases.
the
ninth
circuit
also
reversed
the
montana
case
on
the
ground
that
the
district
judges
there
had
improperly
considered
or
applied
the
considerations
of
wise
judicial
administration.
there
was
no
such
finding
in
the
arizona
cases
because
of
the
disposition
on
the
disclaimer
issue.
the
united
states
agrees
that
the
application
of
the
mccarren
amendment
is
not
barred
by
the
disclaimers
of
arizona,
montana,
and
the
other
western
states.
the
respondent
tribes,
however,
continued
to
read
the
disclaimers
as
a
bar.
i
will
address
that
issue
first
for
both
montana
and
arizona.
the
second
and,
we
believe,
primary
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
considerations
of
wise
judicial
administration
counsel
deference
to
the
state
court
proceedings
in
arizona
and
montana.
i
will
discuss
the
application
of
those
considerations
in
the
arizona
litigation,
which
we
submit
presents
a
much
stronger
case
for
state
court
adjudication
than
did
the
facts
of
colorado
river.
my
co-counsel,
general
greely,
will
address
those
considerations
as
to
the
montana
litigation.
the
disclaimer
provisions
do
not
create
different
law
for
those
eleven
states
admitted
after
1889
than
for
the
states
admitted
before
then.
rather,
the
disclaimers
were
a
response
to
u.s.
versus
mcbratney,
merely
intended
to
confirm
the
plenary
power
of
the
united
states
government
as
to
indian
tribes.
there
was
not
in
1889
and
there
is
not
today
any
reason
to
differentiate
between
the
states.
any
such
distinction
would
be
purely
artificial.
congress
has
made
no
such
distinction
in
passing
laws
applicable
to
all
of
the
states,
nor
has
this
court
in
interpreting
the
applicability
of
laws
to...
state
laws
to
indian
reservations,
and
creation
of
such
a
distinction
today
would
not
only
put
into
question
those
acts
of
congress,
but
also
the
decisions
of
this
court.
as
the
united
states
acknowledges,
it
is
too
late
in
1983
to
create
a
distinction
where
none
has
existed
before.
this
court
has...
that
this
court
has
not
read
the
disclaimer
as
a
bar
is
illustrated
by
your
decision
in
organized
village
of
kake
versus
egan.
there,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
for
a
unanimous
court,
stated
that
even
though
indian
lands
in
arizona
remained
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
united
states,
in
other
words,
subject
to
the
disclaimer,
the
court
had
declared
in
the
arizona
case
of
williams
versus
lee
that
the
test
whether
a
state
law
could
be
applied
on
an
indian
reservation
was
whether
absent
governing
acts
of
congress,
the
application
of
that
law
would
interfere
with
reservation
self-government.
congress
has
exercised
its
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
recognized
by
the
disclaimers
by
enacting
the
mccarren
amendment.
that
is
the
governing
act
of
congress
here.
it
prevents
all
water
rights,
including
those
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribes,
to
be
determined
in
comprehensive
state
court
general
adjudications.
in
other
words,
the
disclaimer
merely
acknowledges
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
pass
a
law
like
the
mccarren
amendment.
nor
does
it
require,
as
the
tribes
argue,
that
the
states
somehow
have
to
repeal
the
disclaimer,
because,
as
this
court
held
in
kake,
the
disclaimer
is
not
inconsistent.
the
right,
or
the
disclaimer,
rather,
of
all
right
and
title
was
merely
a
disclaimer
of
proprietary
interest,
not
governmental
interest,
and
the
acknowledgement
in
the
disclaimers
of
absolute
federal
jurisdiction
and
control
remains
undiminished,
not
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
this
court's
clear
and
meaningful
decision
in
colorado
river
would
be
trivialized
if
the
court
were
now
to
limit
the
application
of
the
mccarren
amendment
to
only
four
western
states.
the
real
question
in
this
case,
we
submit,
is
the
application
of
the
consideration
of
wise
judicial
administration
to
these
cases.
in
colorado
river
you
deferred
to
the
state
court
proceedings
after
considering
those
factors.
a
fortiori,
you
should
do
so
here.
in
colorado
river,
the
most
important
factor
you
found
was
the
mccarren
amendment
itself,
and
you
held
that
the
mccarren
amendment
evinced
two
clear
federal
policies;
number
one,
the
avoidance
of
piecemeal
adjudication
of
water
rights,
and
number
two,
the
recognition
of
the
availability
of,
and
later
in
the
moses
cohn
case
you
said
the
peculiar
appropriateness,
of
comprehensive
state
systems
for
adjudication
of
water
rights.
you
discussed
those
two
first,
the
avoidance
of
piecemeal
adjudication
is
a
critical
factor
here.
unlike
the
facts
of
the
colorado
river
case,
there
are
no
general
adjudications
pending
in
the
arizona
federal
district
court.
the
ninth
circuit
judge
who
dissented,
judge
merrill,
pointed
out
that
in
these
cases
there
would
not
only
be
no
piecemeal
adjudication,
there
would
be
no
adjudication
of
water
rights
at
all
in
the
federal
district
courts.
the
only
adjudication
of
water
rights
that
can
occur
in
arizona,
the
only
comprehensive
adjudication,
is
in
the
state
comprehensive
adjudication
process.
the
second
of
those
two
clear
federal
policies
was
the
recognition
of
the
availability
of
state
courts,
comprehensive
state
proceedings,
and
the
significant
administrative
assistance
given
to
the
state
courts
through
those
comprehensive
state
statutes.
just
one
month
ago
today,
in
the
moses
h.
cohn
case,
mr.
justice
brennan
for
the
court
said,
"there
is
an
affirmative
policy
in
federal
law
expressly
approving
litigation
of
federal
water
rights
in
the
state
court,
the
mccarren
amendment.
"
and
of
course
that
is
precisely
what
the
colorado
river
case--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
mr.
justice
white--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--no,
mr.
justice
white.
this
court
in
the
colorado--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--yes,
it
does,
but
there
has
been,
i
believe,
in
this
case
no
question
about
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
arizona
state
proceedings,
the
ability
of
those
statutes
to
comprehensively
and
properly--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--mr.
justice
white,
the
arizona
federal
district
judge,
judge
cordoga,
did
precisely
that.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
well,
that's
correct,
and
we
would
certainly
submit
that
the
judge
in
the
very
best
position
to
weigh
these
factors
would
be
the
federal
district
judge
who
is
on
the
spot,
who
made
the
decision.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
well,
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
answer
that
question
two
ways.
first
of
all,
let
me
reiterate,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
a
serious
contention
in
this
case--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--that
the
state
law
is
deficient
in
any
respect.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
secondly,
we
believe
that
this
case
is
before
the
court.
all
of
the
factors
that
need
to
be
weighed
are
before
the
court.
the
factors
go
really
more
to
policy
considerations
in
many
respects
than
they
do
testimonial
facts,
and
this
court
clearly
can
weigh
the
same
kind
of
factors
that
it
did
in
the
colorado
river
decision
here,
based
upon
the
record
before
the
court.
the
arizona
proceedings,
as
i
said,
are
comprehensive,
they
are
modern,
fair,
and
efficient,
and
as
i
indicated,
there
is
nothing
comparable
for
the
federal
courts
in
arizona.
another
important
factor
in
colorado
river
was
how
much
progress
had
occurred.
there
was
some
discussion
of
the
race
to
the
courthouse.
of
course,
the
arizona
actions
were
filed
first.
but
that
is
not
the
important
thing.
what
progress
had
occurred?
in
the
federal
courts,
no
progress
had
occurred,
because
before
any
answers
were
filed,
the
district
judge
either
dismissed
or
stayed
or
remanded
all
of
the
tribal
actions,
so
nothing
had
occurred.
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
by
contrast,
as
i
indicated
in
the
beginning,
there
have
been
significant
proceedings,
and
a
great
deal
of
progress
toward
the
adjudication
of
water
rights.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
indians,
or
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
indians,
have
repeatedly
sought
extensions
of
time
for
the
filing
of
their
claims
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
yes.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
no
indian
rights
have
been
adjudicated
in
the
state
court
proceedings.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
the
indians
rely
upon
the
reserved
right
doctrine,
and
that
doctrine
is
a
doctrine
of
federal
law
applicable
in
the
state
courts
as
well
as
the
federal
courts.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
mr.
justice
stevens,
we
would
suggest
not.
the
determination
that
takes
place
in
the
state
court
is
a
complex
determination.
it
starts
with
the
investigation
of
the
river
system
itself
by
the
department
of
water
resources,
the
physical
on-site
investigation,
to
determine
how
much
water
is
available.
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
suggestion
of
the
united
states,
for
example,
there
is
the
idea
that
somehow
this
is
a
very
simple
proposition
with
respect
to
indian
reserved
rights.
it
is
not
a
simple
proposition
at
all,
if
done
correctly,
because
the
reserved
right
doctrine
depends
upon
the
availability
of
water.
the
reserved
rights
are
not
implied
to
exist
if
they
conflict
with
prior
appropriated
rights
or
naturally
if
there
is
not
enough
water
available.
so
the
first
thing
that
occurs
in
the
state
proceedings
is
an
investigation
of
the
state
court,
or,
excuse
me,
the
state
river
system.
that
has
been
going
forward.
the
filing
of
claims
is
the
next
point.
the
united
states
has
filed
2,315
claims
in
the
cases
before
the
court.
there
is
another
case
not
before
the
court
in
which
one
of
the
indian
tribes
and
the
united
states
have
filed
their
claims.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
no.
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
consolidated
cases
and
the
little
colorado
proceeding
that
are
before
this
court...
there
are
some
other
cases
that
are
pending,
but
not
before
the
court.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
yes,
there
are--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--there
have
been
over
70,000
defendants
personally
served.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
mr.
justice
brennan,
no,
there
is
only
one
issue
in
any
of
these
cases,
and
that
is
the
inter
sese
determination
of
rights:
who
has
how
much
water
right
at
what
point
in
time,
and
how
does
it
relate
to
all
of
the
other
holders
of
water
rights?
and
that
issue
is
best
determined,
as
this
court
held
in
colorado,
in
a
unitary
proceeding
in
which
all
of
the
parties
are
before
the
court,
can
present
any
testimony
and
evidence
that
is
required
in
order
to
fit
it
all
together,
and
then
a
final
binding
decree
is
issued
which
is--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--mr.
justice
stevens,
there
are
some
decrees
existing
in
the
state
of
arizona,
but
one
of
the
key
reasons
for
the
implementation
of
the
arizona
statutory
procedure
in
the
1970's
was
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
those
decrees
were
simply
insufficient.
they
related
primarily
to
parts
of
the--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--no,
they
are
certainly
not
nullities,
but
they
only
went--
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
--yes,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
it
simply
would
be
incorrect
for
me
to
suggest
that
since
1900
there
has
been
an
ongoing
procedure.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
yes.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
certainly
so.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
absolutely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
yes,
almost
completely
so.
the
reason
i
say
almost
is
that
we
don't
have
just
one
federal
court
action
here.
each
of
the
tribes
have
proposed
that
they
file
their
own
individual
suit,
so
all
of
the
defendants
that
are
in
the
state
court
proceedings
that
are
in
that
particular
river
system
would
have
to
be
made
a
party,
so
it
is
almost
a
complete
duplication.
one
other
consideration
that
this
court
noted
in
the
moses
cohn
case
that
was
not
specifically
addressed
in
colorado
river
was
the
justification
for
filing
of
duplicate
suits,
and
i
did
want
to
make
the
point
that
the
filing
of
the
federal
actions
in
arizona
was
reactive
and
vexatious.
it
was
reactive
to
the
service
of
process
of
the
state
adjudications.
we
submit
that
that
is
not
a
valid
reason
to
prefer
the
federal
court
over
the
state
courts.
and
may
it
please
the
court,
let
me
simply
conclude
with
a
brief
point
about
the
proposal
of
the
government
and
the
tribes.
the
only
justification
that
has
been
presented
for
this
new
proposal
surfacing
at
this
stage
is
the
notion
that
the
tribes
need
the
protection
of
the
federal
court.
that
question
was
argued
to
this
court
in
colorado
river.
it
was
decided
by
this
court
in
colorado
river,
where
you
specifically
held
that
indian
rights
could
be
subjected
to
state
court
determination,
and
that
doing
so
would
not
imperil
those
rights.
far
from
creating
more
certainty,
the
government's
proposal
would
raise
questions
which
we
believe
would
plague
this
court
for
years.
it
is
legally
flawed.
it
is
piecemeal.
it
is
duplicative,
wasteful,
all
of
these
things
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
in
some
detail,
and
this
is
also
true
with
respect
to
the
tribes'
proposals
for
class
action
lawsuits,
which
are
an
even
more
piecemeal
way
of
approaching
the
problem
than
the
proposal
of
the
united
states.
this
court,
we
believe,
is
faced
with
a
choice,
application
of
its
clear
and
workable
holding
in
the
colorado
river
decision
in
forcing
the
congressional
policy
enunciated
in
the
mccarren
amendment,
or
attempting
to
fashion
a
new
rule
contrary
to
prior
decisions
and
contrary
to
the
legislative
intent
of
mccarren.
we
urge
the
court
to
reinstate
the
ruling
of
the
district
judge.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
yes,
i
do
have
some
remarks.
the
tribes
and
the
government
speak
of
history
and
policy.
we
believe
that
the
history
is
the
mccarren
amendment,
that
congress's
legislative
intent
was
clear,
and
that
that
is
where
policy
issues
should
be
resolved.
this
court
interpreted
the
mccarren
amendment
in
its
colorado
river
decision,
and
i
suggest
that
most
of
the
suggestions
of
the
tribes
and
the
government
are
indeed
to
revisit
that
case.
for
example,
the
suggestion
that
the
mccarren
amendment
did
not
waive
indian
tribal
sovereignty.
indian
tribal
sovereignty
is
deemed
waived
because
the
assertion
of
the
claims
is
by
the
united
states,
and
the
united
states's
tribal...
sovereign
immunity
is
waived
under
the
mccarren
amendment.
the
reading
of
the
congressional
intent
with
respect
to
section
1362
that
mr.
claiborne
just
offered
to
you
would
suggest
to
you
that
the
indian
tribes
have
a
greater
right
to
access
to
the
federal
courts
under
section
1362,
which
only
eliminated
the
$10,000
jurisdictional
barrier,
than
the
united
states
has
under
section
1345,
which
this
court
was
dealing
with
in
colorado
river,
a
truly
anomalous
result.
that
is
not
what
either
congress
has
intended
or
what
this
court
would
intend
in
the
colorado
river
decision.
mr.
pelcyger
suggests
that
the
mccarren
amendment...
excuse
me,
that
the
disclaimer
really
suggests
that
there
is
an
absolute
bar.
the
disclaimer
is
not
an
absolute
bar,
as
this
court
has
suggested
in
its
prior
decisions.
for
example,
in
the
mescalero
apache
tribe
case,
this
court
specifically
said
that
even
on
reservations
state
laws
may
be
applied
to
indians
unless
such
application
would
interfere
with
reservation
self-government
or
impair
a
right
granted
or
reserved
by
federal
law.
that
was
a
new
mexico
case.
similar
language
is
found
in
arizona
cases,
in
montana
cases,
in
washington
cases,
in
many
of
the
disclaimer
states.
this
court
has
said
on
many
prior
occasions
that
the
absolute
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
does
not
oust
the
state
of
all
jurisdiction.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
am
not
aware
of
what
a
disclaimer
statute
would
be.
mr.
jon
l.
kyl
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
no,
the
disclaimers
are
occasionally
mentioned
in
these
cases,
but
they
have
never
been
seen
as
a
bar.
with
respect
to
the
theory
of
the
government,
i
want
to
allude
particularly
to
the
navajo
tribe,
because
justice
o'connor
was
making
a
point
that
has
a
great
deal
of
validity
in
these
semi-arid
states.
both
in
terms
of
identifying
legally
what
water
has
been
appropriated,
which
is
done
in
the
state
court
proceedings,
and
identifying
physically
how
much
water
is
available,
it
is
very
important
to
be
able
to
integrate
everything.
the
navajo
tribe
was
put
together
in
17
different
sections
at
17
different
times.
there
are
claims
of
non-indians
interspersed
among
those
various
parts
of
the
navajo
indian
reservation.
that
same
situation
exists
with
respect
to
other
reservations.
whatever
court
is
going
to
determine
all
of
these
rights
is
going
to
have
to
have
all
of
the
parties
before
it
to
hear
all
of
the
claims
at
the
same
time,
identify
the
various
dates
and
the
priorities,
how
much
water
is
physically
available,
what
prior
rights
were
established,
and
then
put
it
all
together.
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
adopted
the
mccarren
amendment.
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
it
was
pointing
to
many
of
the
various
state
statutes
that
permitted
precisely
that.
this
court
in
footnote
2
of
the
colorado
decision
referred
to
the
arizona
statutes
as
among
those
statutes
that
could
determine
all
of
these
rights,
and
the
court
has
declared
on
several
prior
occasions
that
the
adjudication
of
water
rights
are
a
unique
kind
of
litigation
that
require
the...
all
of
the
parties
before
the
court
in
a
unitary
proceeding.
unless
that
is
true,
you
have
intolerable
conflicts
between
courts,
for
example,
the
administration
of
the
same
water
by
a
federal
court
on
the
one
hand
and
a
state
court
on
the
other
hand.
to
which
court
do
the
parties
go
if
a
conflict
develops
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
the
decree
at
a
later
date?
the
conflicts
are
intolerable.
and
if
that
kind
of
a
proposal
is
necessary
to
satisfy
the
government's
concern,
it
can
easily
be
addressed
to
congress,
which
could
then
change
the
law
to
try
to
address
some
of
these
policy
considerations,
but
it
has
not
done
so.
we
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
the
only
way
that
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
other
arid
and
semi-arid
states
of
the
west
are
going
to
finally
get
a
complete
and
binding
determination
of
water
rights
so
that
everyone,
indians
and
non-indians
alike,
can
move
forward,
can
develop
their
economies,
is
if
all
of
the
parties
are
before
the
same
court
at
the
same
time.
this
court
in
colorado
river
said
that
the
rights
of
the
indians
would
not
be
imperiled
by
sending
them
to
state
court.
there
has
been
no
suggestion
by
any
of
the
indian
tribes
in
the
cases
before
you
now
that
the
state
courts
of
arizona
or
montana
are
hostile
to
the
indian
tribes,
and
in
colorado
river
you
specifically
rejected
the
argument
of
the
government.
you
said
that
is
an
erroneous
assumption,
to
assume
that
if
the
indian
tribes
have
to
go
to
state
court,
that
somehow
state
court
judges
are
going
to
deprive
them
of
their
rights.
in
any
event,
this
court
sits
in
final
review
of
any
question
which
has
been
preserved
that
comes
from
a
state
court.
we
submit
that
these
cases
should
be
returned
to
the
district
court,
and
that
the
state
court
adjudications
should
be
allowed
to
proceed.
thank
you.
