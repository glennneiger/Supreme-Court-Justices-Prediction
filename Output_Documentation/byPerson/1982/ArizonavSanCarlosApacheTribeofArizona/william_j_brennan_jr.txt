justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
kyl,
i
think
you
said
earlier
there
had
been
100,000
parties
to
this
state
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
thinking
of
the
state...
of
the
pending
state
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
parties
are
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
gather
the
issues
involved
in
those
cases
are
quite
different
than
in
the
indian
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
kyl,
if
the
indians
prevailed
and
they
were
to
go
into
federal
court,
would
they
have
to
duplicate
what
is
going
on
in
the
state
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
completely
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
effort
made,
mr.
attorney
general,
to
have
state
proceedings
stayed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
blackfeet?
are
they
represented
in
the
state
proceeding
also
by
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
not
representing
the
blackfeet?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
are
represented
today,
they
are
represented
by
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
mr.
claiborne,
are
you
going
to
comment
on
that
motion
of
the
blackfeet
indian
tribe?
they
don't
want
you
to
represent
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
letter
of
march
15th?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
