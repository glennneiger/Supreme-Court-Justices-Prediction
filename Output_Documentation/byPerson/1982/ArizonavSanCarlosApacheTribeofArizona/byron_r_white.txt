justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kyl,
i
take
it
that
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
reach
this
question
with
respect
to
arizona
as
to
whether
wise
judicial
administration
would
suggest
that
the
federal
court
go
on
or
abstain,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
isn't
that...
isn't
that
sort
of
a...
well,
isn't
that
a
question
of
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
whether
it
is
really
comprehensive
or
whether
it
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
go
to
interpreting
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
suppose
we
agree
with
you
on
the
enabling
act
and
on
the
constitution.
suppose
we
agreed
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
wrong
in
disposing
of
the
case
on
that
ground,
the
arizona
case.
shouldn't
we
then
remand
to...
have
them
consider
whether
the
colorado
river
factors
point
one
way
or
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
we
would
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
necessarily
if
the
court
of
appeals
overturned
the
district
judge
on
what
may
be
very
much
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
ask
the
question
of
some
other
source.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
separate
judges
in
different
areas,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
there
are
separate
judges
doing
different
rivers.
justice
byron
r.
white
claiming
the
very...
claiming
the
very
water
that
they
are
suing
for
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
state
adjudications,
have
the
tribes
appeared
independently?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
permitted
to
file
on
their
own
behalf?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
or
not
the
united
states
files
for
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
general,
let
me
go
back
just...
i
meant
to
ask
you,
the
ninth
circuit
did
reach
the
judicial
administration
issue
in
the
montana
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
zeroed
in
on
the
lack
of
comprehensiveness
under
montana
law,
and
isn't
that...
isn't
that
a...
do
you
disagree
with
them
in
that
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
they
were
right
that
it
wasn't,
and
that
factor
ought
to
weigh
heavily
in
favor
of
the
federal
proceeding.
do
the
other
factors
outweigh
it,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
they
right
in
what
they
said
about
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
state
proceeding
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may...
let's
just
talk
about
one
river
system.
just
assume
that
there
was
only
involved
here
one
river
system
in
the
federal
case,
although
certainly
the
state
proceedings
cover
the
whole
state.
for
the
particular
river
system,
is
the
state
proceeding
comprehensive?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
said
that
the
state
adjudication
excluded
some
kind
of
water
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else?
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
have
a
water
right.
he
is
not...
that
is
just
a
riparian
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
it
adjudicated--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
you
don't
have
to
have...
you
don't
have
to
have
an
adjudication
to
let
your
cattle
drink
out
of
the
stream.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
if
you
just...
if
you
are
a
riparian
owner
who
has
cattle--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
can
drink
out
of
the
stream.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
those
are
the
only
things
excluded
in
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean,
on
their
own?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
any
claims,
water
claims
that
have
been
filed
in
those
proceedings
have
been
filed
on
their
behalf
by
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
anybody
ever
serve
them
as
adverse
parties
in
the
state
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
attorney
general
of
montana
suggests
that
the
tribes
should
file
their
claims
in
the
state
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
assume
that
they
cannot?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
assert
they
cannot?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the...
what
is
the...
is
there
a
statute
giving
tribes
sovereign
immunity,
or
a
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
may
not
be
sued
without
their
consent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
rifkind,
the
same
is
true
of
claims
by
the
united
states
on
its
own
behalf.
those
rights
would
be
determined
by
federal
law,
and
yet
the
united
states
has
to
go
litigate
them
in
the
state
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
would
be...
stand
on
a
completely
separate
basis--
justice
byron
r.
white
--just
like
the
indian
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
would
say
there
is
no
claim
involving
an
indian
water
right
that
would
ever
be
appropriate
to
be
tried
in
a
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
the
other
side
says
there
is
never
one
that
would
be
proper
for
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
would
an
inquiry
be
proper?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
indians
can
be
bound
by
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though,
even
though
determining
the
indian
water
right
in
that
proceeding
would
be
a
separate
matter
resting
on
a
separate
foundation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
in
montana
the...
what
if
in
montana...
the
united
states
has
filed
some
claims
on
behalf
of
indians
in
the
state
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
let
us
assume
that
proceeding
goes
forward,
the
federal
court
proceeding
goes
forward,
one
court
ends
up
saying,
well,
the
indian
claim
is
worth
so
many
acre
feet
of
water,
and
in
the
other
proceeding
it
says
it
is
a
different--
justice
byron
r.
white
--ah
ha.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know,
then,
that
something
is
going
to
have
to
be
done
to
avoid
a
conflict.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
something
is...
unless
this
court
or
somebody
does
something,
those
two
proceedings
are
going
to
go
on
side
by
side,
and
there
could
easily
be
a
conflict.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
held
to
the
contrary,
the
people
in
the
federal
courts
will
just
have
to
accommodate
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
not
only
the
quantification
of
the
reserved
right
but
also
its
date
would
be
determined
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
state
law
would
determine
its
priority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
might
be
an
assumption
that
isn't
universally
applicable,
but
anyway,
you
would...
your
answer
is
yes,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
finally
firming
up
the
state...
the
indian
water
right
in
its
priority,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
go
and
have
it
included
in
the
state
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
indians
don't
want
you
to
be?
what
if
they...
if
they
want
a
decree,
want
a
water
right
decree,
isn't
somebody
going
to
have
to
take
their
claim
to
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say,
mr.
claiborne,
that
the
claims
of
the
united
states
in
the
montana
case
were
properly
referred
to
the
state
court,
or
were
there
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
i
mean,
the
united
states'
own
claims.
were
they
properly
referred
to
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
under...
under
colorado
river?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
those
factors
in
colorado
river
would
not
only
authorize
but
require
the
reference
of
the
united
states
claims
to
the
state
court,
but
not
the
indian
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wouldn't...
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
the
reference
of
the
united
states
claims
was
quite
proper
under
colorado
river,
and
yet
the
reference
of
the
indian
claims
were
not
under
those
same
factors.
akin
didn't
distinguish
between
indian
claims
and
united
states
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
really
are,
then,
asking
that
we
really
redo
colorado
river
with
respect
to
indian
claims,
that
those
factors
just...
however
much
they
might
be
satisfied
with
respect
to
the
claims
of
the
united
states
itself,
are
nevertheless
either
not
satisfied
or
there
are
additional
factors
that
come
into
being
that
must
be
brought
to
bear
on
indian
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
say
what
our
rule
ought
to
be
is
a
bright
line
rule.
any
time
in
a
timely
way
the
united
states
or
the
indian
tribe
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
the
quantification
and
the
date
of
priority
of
the
indian
claim
should
be
adjudicated
by
the
federal
court.
