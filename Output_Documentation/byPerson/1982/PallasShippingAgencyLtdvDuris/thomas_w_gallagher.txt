mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
section
33(b)
under
the
act,
to
quote
justice
stevens
in
writing
an
opinion
for
the
unanimous
court
in
the
rodriguez
v.
compass
shipping
case
stated
that
the
wording
of
section
933
is
both
mandatory
and
unequivocal.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
section,
this
wording
of
section
933(b)
is
no
less
mandatory
and
unequivocal
today
as
it
was
when
you
rendered
the
rodriguez
decision.
the
statutory
language
is
crystal
clear.
it's
narrowly
precise,
to
quote
the
terms
of
the
sixth
circuit.
its
intent
is
clear
on
its
face.
you
need
not
even
go
to
legislative
intent
to
receive
what
the
statute
holds.
we,
as
lawyers,
have
the
responsibility
to
advise
our
clients
in
cases
when
they
come
to
us
and
ask
us
what
their
rights
are.
we,
in
this
situation,
with
the
case
of
joseph
duris,
had
the
direct
responsibility
to
advise
him
when
he
came
to
see
us
just
what
his
rights
were.
in
this
case,
he
had
received
a
form
after
claim
was
made,
and
on
that
form
it
stated,
payment
of
compensation
without
award.
indeed,
he
was
paid
compensation
within
14
days
following
his
injury.
he
was
provided
with
notice
that
he
was
paid
compensation.
the
notice
with
which
he
was
paid
compensation
reflected
in
boldface
letters
and
the
form
he
received,
payment
without
award.
he
then
takes
that
form
to
his
lawyer,
seeking
to
be
sure
that
he
is
getting
everything
he's
entitled
to
and
what
am
i
going
to
advise
him?
i'm
going
to
do
what
i
should
do.
i'm
going
to
look
to
the
statute,
and
the
statute
tells
me
that
there
is
an
absolute,
unequivocal,
mandatory
condition
precedent
to
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
case.
and
i'm
going
to
tell
that
to
my
client.
and
on
that
advice,
we
will
proceed
in
our
litigation.
in
this
case,
there
had
not
been
until
february
25,
1983,
any
award
in
a
compensation
order.
to
touch
upon
the
point
brought
up
by
justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
question
in
our
mind.
there
is
no
question
in
the
mind
of
the
amicus
from
the
solicitor
general's
office,
nor
in
the
longshoremen's
union,
nor
in
atla,
who
submitted
amicus
briefs
to
this
court,
that
the
language
is
mandatory
and
that
there
is
that
condition
precedent,
that
that
longshoreman
need
not
worry
about
pursuing
his
third
party
remedy
until
such
time
as
he
receives
an
award
in
a
compensation
order
which
is
filed
by
the
deputy
commissioner.
it's
purposeful
language.
until
that
event
occurs,
he
does
not
have
to
concern
himself
with
proceeding,
other
than
to
try
and
weigh
what
can
or
cannot
be
done
in
the
future,
to
see
what
his
injuries
are,
to
see
what
kind
of
problems
he's
facing.
unfortunately
notwithstanding
this
clear
language,
there
has
arisen
a
conflicts
in
the
circuits
and
there's
a
reason
for
that.
the
key
case
upon
which
the
petitioners
rely,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
they're
relying
on
form
206,
which
is
the
very
form
i
just
mentioned,
which
has
the
bold
print,
without
an
award,
is
the
liberty
mutual
v.
ameta
case.
i
submit
to
you,
as
i
mentioned
in
our
brief,
that
this
case
is
an
aberration
of
the
law.
it
is
not
a
true
statement
of
what
congress
intended.
it
is
not
what
the
law
is
in
this
area.
liberty
mutual
is
based
upon
unique
facts.
it
was
a
situation
where
literally
the
longshoremen
got
together
with
the
ship
owner
and
made
a
settlement,
left
out
the
lien
and
the
rights
of
the
equitable
maritime
under
general
maritime
law
lien
of
the
employer.
the
court,
in
an
effort
to
remedy
that
law,
went
about
seeking
out
proper...
the
proper
thing
to
do,
but
unfortunately
in
the
wrong
method,
and
they
pursued
the
case
from
the
standpoint
that
they
wanted
to
get
that
payment
back
to
the
employer.
therefore,
they
came
up
with
the
idea
that
mere
acceptance
of
compensation
under
an
award
and
certain
acts
of
ratification,
that
meaning
that
there
were
some
informal
hearings,
would
constitute
what
they
felt
was
an
award
in
the
compensation
order.
it
is
very
unfortunate
that
they
felt
the
need--
mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
--very
rare.
mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
i
think
that
the
situation
is
such
that
the
longshoremen
really
follow
what
the
dictations
of
the
law
are.
they
get
prompt
compensation
under
the
no-fault
provisions
of
the
act
and
they're
satisfied
to
a
certain
extent.
then
they
seek
counsel
and
then
pursue
their
remedies
once
they're
advised
just
what
they
are,
both
by
word
of
mouth
and
then
onward
to
see
an
attorney.
but
it's
very
unusual
for
them
to
contact
the
shipowner
or
his
carrier,
from
the
standpoint
that
he
just
doesn't
have
access
to
them
unless
there's
potentially
an
insurance
adjustor
involved
who
perhaps
would
contact
him
directly
and
that
would
put
up
the
red
flag
that
he
should
seek
counsel.
so
i
submit
to
you
that
it's
very
rare,
your
honor.
it
also
brings
up
another
important
point,
though,
from
the
standpoint
that
when
you
have
a
situation
where
an
individual
is
injured
and
if
we
were
to
construe
the
statute
to
be
just
what
this
says
it
is...
just
what
the
petitioners
are
desirous
of
having
it
say,
the
longshoreman
really
only
has
six
months
and
14
days
within
which
to
bring
an
action.
i
submit
to
you
that's
woefully
inadequate
and
congress
recognized
it
to
be
just
that,
woefully
inadequate.
the
problem
is,
if
he
were
to
come
to
me
and
if
that
was
the
law,
i'd
have
to
say
to
him,
we
have
to
file
suit
right
now
and
i
have
to
attach
interrogatories
to
my
complaint
to
seek
out
if
there's
any
other
individual
who
may
responsible
for
your
injury.
by
that,
i
mean
a
case
just
like
this.
joseph
duris
was
injured
in
may
of
1975
while
acting
in
his
capacity
as
a
longshoreman,
but
the
shipowner
wasn't
the
primary
defendant.
the
primary
defendant
was
a
bare
boat
charter
and
i,
as
trial
counsel,
would
have
to
advise
my
client,
we've
got
to
get
that
suit
on
right
now
and
find
out
if
there
is
somebody
else,
if
there's
a
dry
boat
or
bare
boat
charter
whom
we
really
should
be
suing,
or
you
may
find
that
if
we
don't
file
in
time
and
have
the
right
party,
then
you're
totally
lost
as
far
as
the
third
party
liability
aspect
of
the
case.
so
that
short
statute,
the
construction
which
the
petitioners
submit,
is
a
very
dangerous
proposition
for
the
longshoreman.
as
i've
mentioned,
unfortunately,
we're,
excuse
me,
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
liberty
mutual
case
started
this
series
of
cases
indicating
that
mere
compensation
was
mere
sufficient.
and
that
was
even
expanded
upon,
unfortunately,
by
the
simmons
case.
and
the
simmons
case,
they
went
even
one
step
further
in
setting
up
their
three-pronged
test,
which
is
outlined
in
our
brief.
the
unfortunate
aspect
of
that
three-pronged
test
is
that
the
very
second
element
of
that
test
is
to
the
effect
that
when
the
employer's
form
ls-206
is
filed,
that
is
one
of
the
elements
under
which
the
triggering
mechanism
for
the
statute
becomes
applicable.
again,
the
same
bugaboo,
the
same
problem,
the
same
area
of
concern.
the
longshoreman
is
told
that
a
payment
without
an
award
on
a
form,
taking
the
petitioner's
standpoint,
is
truly
payment
under
an
award.
under
such
circumstance
he'd
have
to
take
immediate
action.
following
an
interpretation
such
as
this,
you're
going
to
flood
the
courts
with
lawsuits,
because
we've
got
to
get
them
out
in
time,
we're
going
to
have
to
move
quickly.
also,
going
on
from
the
sentence
court,
the
second
circuit,
to
a
certain
extent,
got
in
on
the
act
from
the
standpoint
that
they
also
interpreted
somewhat
less
accurately
what
the
statute
actually
says.
the
second
circuit
maintained
that
liberty
mutual
was
in
error,
that
there's
no
way
that
the
longshoreman
should
have
the
responsibility
of
picking
up
and
defining
his
rights
so
quickly,
as
liberty
mutual
required.
but
they
stated
that
you
should
have
a
situation
where
it
arises
that
the
longshoreman
has
access
to
all
of
the
information
available
to
him
relative
to
what
the
award
would
or
would
not
be,
in
its
total,
so
that
he
would
have
to
have
an
understanding
of
the
totality
of
the
benefits
applicable
to
him
before
he
should
make
such
an
award.
unfortunately,
they
also,
although
holding
that
in
that
fashion,
neglected
to
truly
look
at
the
statute
and
make
the
determination
that
the
statutory
wording
is
mandatory
and
is
unequivocal
and
requires
one
thing,
the
condition
precedent
that
there
be,
in
each
and
every
case
when
the
assignment
provisions
are
to
become
effective,
an
award
in
a
compensation
order
filed
by
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
significance
of
that
is
that
the
award
in
a
compensation
order
is
a
definable
entity.
it
is
mentioned
in
several
parts
throughout
the
statute,
section
914(e)
and
(f),
particularly
in
point
from
the
standpoint
that
it
sets
up
specific
penalty
provisions
pending
upon
which
actions
the
employers
take.
employers,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
are
not,
i
mean
from
a
day
to
day
standpoint,
are
not
particularly
interested,
they're
in
no
rush
to
have
that
assignment
accrued
to
them.
they've
got
a
benefit
by
this.
and
that
benefit
is,
they
can
sit
on
the
coattails
of
the
employee.
they
have,
under
general
maritime
law,
an
equitable
lien
which
allows
them
to
obtain
back
out
of
the
third
party
suit
any
monies
paid
to
that
employee
under
the
no-fault
provisions
of
the
act.
so
they
don't
have
to
go
offending
their
potential
customers.
they
don't
have
to
do
anything
other
than
wait
it
out,
if
he's
going
to
pursue
it.
and
that,
indeed,
has
happened
in
this
case.
for
several
years
now,
the
unfortunate
status
of
this
litigation
being
in
the
appellate
courts,
and
at
the
trial
court
level,
where
we
haven't
reached
it
on
the
merits
as
yet,
i
still
have
been
receiving
and
coordinating
information
with
the
insurance
carrier
for
the
employers.
they
know
that
we
are
protecting
their
lien.
i
submit
to
you
a
problem.
what
if
this
court
should
decide
to
follow
liberty
mutual?
what
really
happens
to
the
employer,
actually,
his
insurance
carrier,
who
by
statute
is
subjugated
to
his
interest?
what
happens
to
him
is
that
he's
faced
with
a
vigorous
defense
from
these
same
petitioners
and
a
defense
of
laches.
sure,
it's
been
a
long
time
since
this
man
was
injured
and
since
those
payments
were
made.
very
often
it
takes
a
long
time
to
define
what
impact
on
your
life
a
serious
injury
has
occurred.
the
employer
would
be
subjected
to
a
situation
where
he
is
ultimately
going
to
enmeshed
in
litigation
to
defend
when
he
has
relied
on
his
interpretation
of
the
law,
like
we
have,
pursuing
the
action
in
this
fashion.
the
legislative
history
is
also
indicative
of
the
intent
of
congress
that
this
wording
be
clear.
since
1938,
the
courts,
i
submit
to
your
case
of
american
stevedores
v.
porello,
holding
that
mere
compensation
is
not
sufficient
to
trigger
the
statute
of
limitations,
is
still
good,
valid
and
viable
law
today.
the
wording
that
i'm
referring
to,
the
award
in
a
compensation
order
filed
by
a
deputy
commissioner,
had
not
been
changed
by
congress
in
any
of
the
three
times
this
act
has
been
amended.
strike
that,
i
mean
the
two,
since
it
was
put
into
the
act
in
1938.
it
was
thoroughly
reviewed
in
1959
and
at
those
legislative
hearings
it
was
even
pointed
out
that
congress
was
very
interested
in
the
state
of
the
judicial
interpretation
of
this
statute.
they
liked
what
they
saw.
they
liked
what
this
court
was
doing
and
what
the
appellate
courts
and
circuit
courts
were
doing,
because
they
were
interpreting
the
law
as
it
was
and
as
it
is
today.
so
also
in
1972
when
they
amended
this
section
of
the
statute
again.
they
didn't
touch
this
wording.
this
wording
provided
the
condition
precedent
upon
which
an
employer
would
take
action.
and
until
it
was
effectuated,
there
was
no
need
for
the
employee
to
take
action.
i
submit
to
you
that
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioners,
they
saw
the
infirmities
of
their
arguments
relative
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
and
they
came
up
with
a
new
theory,
that
being
that
section
919(c)
of
the
act
does
not
apply
to
strictly
controverted
claims,
that
it
applies
in
all
cases.
a
careful
review
of
that
statute
will
reflect
that
that's
just
not
the
case.
section
919(c)
reflects
only,
and
is
applicable
only,
to
those
cases
where
there
is
a
controversion.
and
the
controversion
concept's
important,
too,
from
the
standpoint
as
mentioned
by
mr.
carle
earlier.
they
maintain
that
the
employer
must
controvert
every
claim
in
order
to
get
his
assignment.
number
one,
he's
not
that
interested
in
that
assignment
to
begin
with,
if
there's
a
third
party
liability
claim
because
he's
going
to
watch
the
suit
of
the
longshoreman.
number
two,
the
situation
is
such
that
he
doesn't
need
to
pursue
the
matter,
because
of
that
action,
and
at
the
same
time
he
has
his
own
rights
under
the
burnside
decision
of
a
general
maritime
action
over
against
the
shipowner,
should
he
desire
to
do
that.
that
case,
which
has
been
attacked
by
the
petitioners,
is
still
valid
law.
this
court
in
cindia
steamship
lines
v.
delasantos
left
open
the
fact
that
the
shipowner
still
has
a
duty
to
a
longshoreman
and
if
he
breaches
that
duty,
he
would
have
to
be
subjected
to
a
third
party
suit,
or
can
be
subjected
to
a
third
part
suit
directly
from
the
longshoreman.
so
therefore,
that
notice
of
contravention,
the
active
participation
of
the
longshoreman
in
contravening
is
not
that
necessary
from
a
simple
standpoint
that
if,
at
any
time,
he's
worried
about
his
compensation
benefits,
the
fact
that
he's
put
this
money
out
and
hasn't
got
it
back
yet,
he
can,
at
any
time,
voluntarily
indicate
to
the
deputy
commissioner
that
he
wants
an
award.
that
is
19(c)...
919(c).
the
code
of
federal
regulations
also
provides
for
that
interpretation
and
that
is,
that
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
i
submit
to
you
that
another
review
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations
will
also
reflect
the
fact
that
there
are
procedures
which
are
applicable
to
this
case
and
other
longshoreman
cases
like
it
from
the
standpoint
that
these
hearings
are
to
be
informal
in
nature.
it's
important
to
consider
the
whole
concept.
the
longshoremen
act
is
a
comprehensive
scheme
to
take
care
of
the
longshoreman
first.
he's
the
primary
beneficiary
of
the
act.
secondly,
the
employer,
to
try
and
get
back
the
money
he
spent,
if
there
is
a
third
party
who
is
liable,
if
there's
a
third
party
who's
caused
the
injury.
why
harm
the
longshoreman
and
why
harm
the
employer,
and
that's
the
idea
behind
the
act.
i
submit
to
you
that
if
you
take
the
narrow
construction
and
ignore
the
statutory
language
that
the
petitioners
desire,
who
benefits?
only
one
person
and
that's
the
shipowner,
or
the
bare
boat
charter.
they
get
the
benefit
of
the
short
statute
of
limitations.
they
get
the
benefit
of
getting
out
of
this
picture
soon,
rapidly.
and
also,
there's
the
trap
that
the
longshoreman
can
make
unwitting
assignments.
if
you
hit
him
with
a
long...
with
a
very
short
statute
of
limitations
you're
facing
the
situation
or
prospect
where
he's
not
going
to
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
for
himself
what
needs
to
be
done,
if
there
is,
indeed,
the
potential
for
a
third
party
action.
that
is
an
incongruous
and
harsh
result
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
attempted
to
avoid.
mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
i
think
that
you
have
to
go
right
back
to
the
statute,
that
there
still
is
a
six
month
statute
of
limitations,
only
on
those
occasions,
however,
when
there
is
an
award.
mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
well,
in
most
situations,
it's
up
to
the
employer.
it's
the
shipowner
who
wants
you
to
say
that
there's
not
going
to
be
an
award,
that
the
figures
are
reflective
of
very
few
awards.
the
realities
are
that
if
the
individuals
who
the
act
is
to
protect,
and
in
this
example,
the
employer,
wants
to
have
the
award,
wants
to
have
his
assignment,
he
can
do
so
at
any
time.
mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
potentially
you
could.
mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
i
think
you
could.
i
think
that
that
wording
was
specific
in
the
case
law,
as
indicated,
just
what...
that
it
is
what
it
says
and
that
if
nothing
were
to
be
done,
anywhere
on
down
the
line,
certainly
the
door
would
be
open.
from
a
practical
standpoint
with
the
longshoreman,
however,
that
doesn't
happen.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that
has
had
any
such
factual
circumstance.
this
case
is
probably
unique
from
the
standpoint
that
only,
in
looking
at
the
calendar,
the
injury
was
1975
and
here
we
are
in
1983.
the
longshoreman
will
get
his
initial
benefits
and,
pursuant
to
the
act
and
the
intent
of
congress,
weigh
his
variables.
and
generally,
within
a
year
or
two,
just
like
any
other
victim
of
a
tort-feasor,
will
generally
file
suit.
joe
duris
did
in
this
case.
we
filed
suit
for
him,
the
first
lawsuit,
april
12,
1977.
that
eight
year
comment
made
is
strictly
one
only
related
to
the
fact
that
the
injury
occurred
eight
years
ago.
it
has
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
fact
that
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
april
of
1977,
the
first
lawsuit.
mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
it
could
have
been.
mr.
thomas
w.
gallagher
my
caveat
to
that,
though,
is,
however,
it's
highly
unlikely.
i
am
aware
of
no
such
circumstance.
for
the
foregoing
reasons,
we
would
ask
this
court
affirm
the
sixth
district.
