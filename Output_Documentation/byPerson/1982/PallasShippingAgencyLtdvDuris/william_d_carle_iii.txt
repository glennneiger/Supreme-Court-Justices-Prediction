mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
voluntary
acceptance
of
compensation
plus
the
filing
and
review
of
certain
documents
by
the
deputy
commissioner
is
sufficient
to
trigger
the
assignment
provisions
of
section
33(b)
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harborworker's
compensation
act.
secondarily,
whether
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest
which,
between
the
employer
and
the
employee,
which
would
preclude
an
assignment
under
section
33(b).
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
that
the
sixth
circuit
decision
is
erroneous,
that
it
misapplied
the
law
as
it
relates
to
section
33(b)
and
applied...
relied
to
a
great
extent
upon
conflict
of
interest
principles
which
this
court
has
held
are
not
applicable
in
the
classic
situation
that
exists
between
the
longshoreman
and
his
employer.
i
would
like
to
discuss
just
briefly
the
facts.
mr.
duris
was
injured
in
may
of
1975.
shortly
thereafter
the
stevedore
employer
commenced
benefits
to
mr.
duris
which
were
paid
either
bi-weekly
or
weekly
for
a
period
of
two
years
through
april
28,
1977.
at
that
time,
mr.
duris
had
recovered
and
returned
to
work
and
payments
were
stopped
or
suspended
and
a
form
filed
with
the
department
of
labor.
we
also
know,
at
this
point,
in
time
that
during
the
intervening
period,
or
during
that
period
between
'75
and
'77,
that
there
was
a
formal
claim
filed
by
mr.
duris
and
certain
other
informal
conferences,
or
a
conference
held
with
all
of
the
parties
represented.
on
april
8,
1980,
the
lawsuit
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
was
commenced
and
on
februay
25,
1983,
duris
received
a
final
award.
throughout
the
entire
compensation
proceedings
and
otherwise,
duris
has
been
represented
by
competent
counsel.
i
would
like,
at
this
point,
to
give
you
an
overview
of
what
our
argument
is
going
to
be
in
this
case.
it
is
petitioner's
contention,
first,
that
section
33(b)
of
the
act
contemplates
an
assignment
in
each
and
every
case.
secondly,
that
the
congressional
hearings
at
the
time
of
the
amendments
indicate
that
the
assignment
should
take
place
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
inception
of
each
claim.
third,
that
formal
compensation
orders
are
not
required
to
constitute
an
award.
four,
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
quid
pro
quo
of
the
act
be
maintained
in
balance.
and
five,
that
congress,
when
it
amended
the
act,
certainly
did
not
contemplate
eight
years
between
injury
and
assignment.
the
sixth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case,
we
submit,
is
erroneous
in
that
it
took
an
unduly
restrictive
approach
to
the
question
at
hand.
the
sixth
circuit
started
its
opinion
and
discussion
of
the
legal
issues
by
summarily
disposing
of
two
cases
from
another
circuit
which
it
stated
it
simply
would
not
follow.
these
cases
had
held
that
some
act
of
ratification
of
compensation
plus
the
filing
of
documents
and
acceptance
of
compensation
by
the
longshoreman
was
sufficient
to
constitute
an
award
under
the
act
and
specifically
33(b).
these
same
documents
were
filed
of
record
in
the
duris
case
and
the
court
gave
absolutely
no
consideration
to
them
in
considering
whether
there
should
have
been
an
award.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
even
find
them
mentioned
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
that
troubles
me
on
the
term
of
art.
i
don't
believe
it's
a
term
of
art,
really,
because
you
find
as
you
read
the
act
they
use
the
term
compensation
order,
they
use
the
term
order,
depending
upon
what
subject
they're
attempting
to
approach.
and
i
just
hardly
think
that
it's
a
term
of
art,
at
least
in
the
sense
that
i
understand
what
is
meant
by
a
term
of
art.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
well,
it's
certainly
our
contention
that
it
don't.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
that,
i
don't
believe,
is
quite
correct.
the
government
does
state
in
their
brief
that
an
award,
they
would
seem
to
implicate,
at
any
rate,
that
an
award
is
very
easy
to
obtain
from
the
department
of
labor.
the
award
contemplates
agreement
between
the
parties
and
they
simply,
the
formal
award,
such
as
was
later
entered
in
this
case
in
february
of
1983,
simply
does
not
come
around
quite
that
easy.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
--i
find
no
authority
for
that
in
the
regulations
or
the
act
itself.
if
the
employer
contravenes,
he
can
obtain
an
award
and
really,
when
you
analyze
the
duris
opinion,
that
is
what
the
duris
opinion
has
to
say,
that
you
must
contravene
in
order
to
obtain
an
award
and
our
position
is
that
that
certainly
is
not
necessary.
indeed,
as
i
go
through
the
argument,
i
would
intend
to
submit
that
it's
not
even
proper.
and
we'll
go
on
with
that,
as
you'll
see,
justice
o'connor.
just
prior
to
disposing
summarily
of
the
two
cases
which
were
decided
counter
to
what
the
sixth
circuit
was
going
to
decide,
the
sixth
circuit
had
this
to
say.
"the
act
noted
earlier
makes
purposeful
use
of
the
term
award.
"
"thus,
if
benefits
are
paid
without
an
award,
there
should
be
no
assignment
and
no
six-month
limitation
period.
"
now
i
can
agree
literally
with
what
the
court
has
stated
here.
but
i
submit
to
interpret
that
and
apply
it
to
the
act
as
the
court
did
in
this
case,
is
going
to
do
extreme
violence
to
the
scheme
of
the
act
and
if
the
court
would
view
the
statistics
compiled
by
the
department
of
labor,
which
were
lodged
with
the
court
by
our
amicus
in
this
cases,
you
will
see
that
only
in
two
percent
of
the
cases
are
formal
compensation
awards
entered.
and
that's
disputed
cases,
and
it's
less
than
that
in
undisputed
cases.
now,
we
firmly
believe
that
congress
intended
that
an
award
and
assignment
be
issued
in
every
case
and
we
point
to
the
1972
amendments
to
the
act
in
which
congress
extensively
revised
section
905(b)
with
respect
to
third
party
liability.
and
in
that
revision,
congress
stated
that
the
third
party
liability
action
is
to
be
brought
in
"accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
33(b).
"
furthermore,
the
quid
pro
quo
of
the
act
certainly
gives
the
employer,
we
contend,
the
right
to
review
independently
all
of
his
cases
and
determine
whether
he
wants
to
bring
a
third
party
action.
it's
also
clear,
we
believe,
that
if
the
employer
is
going
to
lose
this
right,
he
has
indeed
lost
a
valuable
right.
when
we
look
at
section
33
as
a
whole,
because
there's
the
election
and
then
the
assignment
and
then
some
other
sections,
but
when
we
look
at
that
as
a
whole,
we'll
find
that
sections
(a)
and
(b)
of
section
33
certainly
give
the
employee
and
employer
both
a
cause
of
action,
at
least
by
implication,
certainly
to
the
employee.
and
for
certain
in
section,
i
believe
it's
(d),
gives
the
employer
a
cause
of
action
for
recovery
under
the
act
of
his
compensation
loss.
now,
if
that
is
the
case,
then
certainly
this
statute
contemplates
an
assignment
in
each
and
every
case.
the
conditional
understanding
that
employer
and
employee
would
have
consecutive
rights
to
each
third
party
action
is
implicit,
we
believe,
in
the
hearings.
now,
the
sixth
circuit,
having
said
that
in
the
case
of
voluntary
payments
there
could
be
no
assignment...
no
award
and
no
assignment,
thus
no
assignment,
or
no
six
month
limitation
period,
realized
that
they
had
to
come
up
with
something
for
this
poor
employer,
who
is
left
with
his
compensation
payments.
and
in
the
event
the
employee
did
not
sue
a
third
party,
he
had
no
way
to
recover
them.
so,
the
sixth
circuit
said,
all
right,
we'll
give
him
a
burnside
remedy.
the
burnside
remedy
stems
from
a
case
decided
by
this
court
back
in
1969
in
which
a
tort
action
was
permitted
to
the
stevedore
in
order
to
permit
him
to
recover
other
than
under
section
33
of
the
act.
so,
they
came
up
with
this
burnside
remedy,
injected
it
into
the
case,
and
said
mr.
employer,
you've
got
your
remedy,
while
we,
on
the
petitioner's
side,
question
the
existence
or
nonexistence,
whether
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
this
nonstatutory
cause
of
action
is
relevant
to
these
proceedings.
nevertheless,
certainly
the
viability
of
burnside
today
is
extremely
questionable
in
view,
again,
of
the
extensive
revision
to
section
905(b),
third
party
liability
section
of
the
act
with
its
exclusivity
language.
furthermore,
i
find
it
extremely
hard
to
rationalize,
in
my
mind,
that
any
employer
today
would
want
a
tort-only
cause
of
action
for
recovery
of
his
compensation
loss
or
other
damages
in
which
he
would
be
subjected
to
the
possibility,
at
least,
will
he
be
subjected
to
the
proportional
fault
recovery
in
the
case,
and
possibly
no
recovery.
next,
the
sixth
circuit
in
duris
hit
on
the
controversion
issue,
which
i
was
discussing
a
few
moments
ago
with
justice
o'connor.
the
court
expressed
the
view,
with
respect
to
controversion
that
by
the
employer
controverting
the
claim,
that
it
would
bring
the
employee
into
contact
with
the
statutes
which
would,
in
turn,
make
the
employee
aware
of
the
assignment
provision
and
then,
in
view
of
its
previous
statement,
which
i
quoted
earlier,
indicated
that
the
only
true
way
in
which
an
award
could
be
obtained
in
a
33(b)
action
would
be
via
contravention.
we
suggest
that
the
sixth's
circuit's
reasoning
is
faulty.
certainly
the
regulations
contemplate
the
informal
administration
of
this
act
and
to
minimize
contravention
and/or
hearings
which
would
be
held
as
a
result
thereof.
what,
i
think,
the
court
neglected
to
consider
is
that
when
you
controvert
a
claim,
you
controvert
the
right
to
receive
compensation
and
under
the
act,
section
14
and
section
19,
in
order...
well,
both
provide
that
this
will
happen
early
on
in
the
handling
of
any
particular
case
within
14
days
under
section
14
and
within
14
days
under
section
19.
but,
in
any
event,
if
you
controvert,
it's
going
to
happen
early
on
in
the
case.
it
will
admittedly
result
in
a
hearing
and
award.
now,
how
controversion
is
going
to
make
the
employee
cognizant
of
his
rights
under
the
statutes
and,
in
particular,
his
rights
under
the
assignment
provision,
is
certainly
a
mystery
to
me.
the
smooth
operation
of
the
act,
we
submit,
should
not
call
for
contravention
by
the
employer
on
each
and
every
case
in
order
to
obtain
this
award
and,
indeed,
as
i
suggested
previously,
we
feel
it
may
be
highly
improper.
next,
the
court
considered
the
conflict
of
interest
question
and
pointed
to
the
disincentive
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
bring
suit
under
the
act.
the
sixth
circuit
stated
"this
conflict
of
interest
problem
makes
us
hesitate
to
countenance
any
interpretation
of
the
act
which
would
expand
the
assignment
provision
of
section
33.
"
we
submit
that
the
underlying
reason
given
by
the
court,
mainly
conflict
of
interest,
will
not
legally
justify
its
conclusion
with
respect
to
an
expanded
interpretation.
this
court
considered
an
identical
argument,
conflict
of
interests,
business
relationship,
in
its
recent
decision
in
rodriguez
and
rejected
it.
we
submit
that
the
sixth
circuit's
reasoning
in
the
duris
opinion
simply
cannot
be
sustained
on
sound
legal
principles.
i'd
like,
at
this
point,
to
discuss,
for
a
short
time,
the
history
of
the
act.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
certainly.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
yes.
the...
what
we
believe
is
necessary
is
that
you
have
to
have
an
agreement
of
the
parties
along
with
the
filing
of
the
documents.
now,
the
compensation,
justice
stevens,
is
going
to
start
even
before
the
filing
of
the
206.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
and
after
the
206,
of
course,
it
would
continue
at
the
same
rate.
now,
when
do
we
contend
that
this
agreement
took
place?
when
the
employee
accepted,
when
there
was
really
an
agreement
for
the
employee
to
accept
the
compensation
and
when
the
206
was
filed
with
the
department
of
labor,
reviewed
by
them
and
filed.
at
that
point--
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
--yes.
that's
right.
the
208
was
filed.
we
did
rely
upon
the
208.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
pardon?
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
no,
we
suggested
that
it
could
be
used
as
one
means
of
determining
when
an
award
might
be
entered.
the
208,
as
i'm
sure
you're
aware,
takes
place
at
the
end
of
the
temporary
total
disability
period
and
it
is
a
form
that
is
used
in
each
and
every
case
and
if
it
were
used,
it
would
give
the
longshoreman
a
little
bit
longer
period
in
which
to
consider
his
options.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
pardon?
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
no.
that's
a
problem
with
the
208,
to
be
very
frank.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
it's
a
form...
it's
one
of
the
considerations
which
we
propose
that
this
court
might
consider
and,
as
i
say,
i
understand
it
has
the
advantage
of
certainty
after
a
temporary
disability
period.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
it
has
the
disadvantage
of
handing
the
employer
a
stale
claim.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
yes,
but
really,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
all
compensation
starts
without
an
award.
at
least,
in
my
view
it
does,
from
practical
operation.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
yes.
but
the
award
comes
at
the
time
that
there's
an
acceptance
of
that
compensation
by
the
longshoreman,
plus
the
filing
of
the
form
with
the
deputy
commissioner
and
then
he's
got
six
months
to
consider
his
options
from
that
point
on.
in
examining
the
history,
just
briefly,
we're
all
aware
that
when
the
act
was
enacted
in
1927
that
the
longshoreman
had
no
option.
he
either
took
his
compensation
or
he
was
required
to
file
against
a
third
party.
there
was
an
automatic
assignment
under
the
statutes
as
they
existed
at
that
time
and
the
quid
pro
quo
of
the
act
i
think
is
important
at
that
time,
in
that
the
employee
gave
up
a
right
to
sue
for
sure
compensation
and,
in
return,
the
employer
accepted
fault
on
a
no-fault
basis,
basically.
and
it's
also
important
to
note
that
from
1927
to
the
present
day,
that
assignment
provision
has
been
part
of
the
quid
pro
quo
of
the
act.
i'd
like
to
hold
five
minutes,
if
i
may.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
well,
i
would
just
have
to
respectably
disagree,
justice
o'connor.
i
feel
that
there
is
both
the
ten
percent
penalty,
prior
to
an
award,
and
the
20
percent
penalty
after
an
award
and
i
certainly--
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
well,
it
would
depend
on
how
long
and
when
they
started
the
compensation.
but
the
penalties
are
both
there
and
i
think--
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
--i
understand.
i
understand.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
well,
you
would
certainly
need
it,
for
instance,
the
act
provides
for
contravention
immediately
or
within
14
days.
you've
got
to
do
it
within
14
days
under
section
14,
so
if
you
contravene
and
did
not
pay,
and
then
there
did
come
a
subsequent
hearing
at
which
they
said,
pay,
you're
going
to
have
a
ten
percent
penalty
throughout
that
entire
period.
i
think,
i
think
the
ten
percent
penalty
is
there
and
i
think
it's
there
for
a
purpose.
mr.
william
d.
carle,
iii
yes.
i'd
just
like
to
comment.
we,
as
that
awful
shipowner,
don't
quite
look
it
as
a
six
month
limitation.
we
look
it
as
an
assignment
to
know
who
has
control
of
this
action.
supposedly,
we're
the
third
party
tort-feasor,
under
section
905.
we
have
a
right
to
know,
we
think,
who
has
the
right
to
bring
this
cause
of
action
in
order
to
prevent
multiplicity
of
litigation,
which
is
what
i
thought
we
were
trying
to
avoid,
after
the
1972
amendments.
now,
there
was,
in
this
claim...
in
this
particular
case,
a
formal
claim
filed.
unfortunately,
it's
not
in
the
record
of
the
case.
it
was
only
obtainable
by
us,
just
as
a
matter
of
fact
before
we
wrote
our
reply
brief,
when
the
file
was
closed
with
the
owcp.
but
it
is
there
and
section
19
does
apply
to
it
and
the
notice
to
the
employer
is
there,
so
that,
really,
any
way
you
would
look
at
this
case,
mr.
duris
is
late,
a
long
time
late,
in
bringing
his
cause
of
action
in
1980.
now,
granted,
he
did
have
two
previous
causes
of
action,
but
those
causes
of
action
were
gone
by
the
time
that
this
cause
of
action,
with
which
we
are
here
concerned,
was
run.
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing.
congress,
we
feel,
intended
only
a
reasonable
period
of
time
in
which
to...
in
which
the
employee
should
be
allowed
to
consider
his
options.
it
certainly
didn't
consider
eight
years
and
if
that
is
what
we're
going
to
be
stuck
with,
we
might
just
as
well
write
the
assignment
provision
right
out
of
the
act.
i
thank
you.
