before
you
do
that,
mr.
carle,
can
i
ask
you
just
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--one
specific
question?
when,
in
your
view,
did
the
six
months
period
start
to
run,
when
the
form
206
was
filed
or
the
form
208?
the
brief,
i
think,
is
a
little
ambiguous
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
then
are
not
relying
on
the
208,
because
your
brief
says
when
the
206
and
208
were
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
today?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
had
a
permanent
disability
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
have
permanent
disability,
so
that
your
period
of
payments
extended
for
a
longer
period
of
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
really
trying
to
find
out
is
whether
you
really
rely
on
the
208
form
at
all
or
not.
i
know
that
would
make
the
case
a
little
less
extreme,
but
we
have
to
figure
out
what
the
rule
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
temporary
disability
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
trouble
with
the
form
206
is
that
it's
a
little
bit
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
statute,
because
that
form,
in
terms,
is
compensation
without
an
award.
that's
what
the
form
says,
and
we
need
an
award,
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
statute
talks
about
an
award,
that's
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gallagher,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
assume
that
we
agree
with
you,
that
we
read
the
statute
literally
and
there's
no
six
months
limitation
period
here.
what,
if
any,
limitation
period
is
there
on
the
suit
you
may
bring?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
98
percent
of
the
cases,
there's
no
award.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
really
not
my
question.
assume
nothing
is
done
and
you
have
this
informal
method
of
proceeding.
is
there
any
period,
any
bar
at
all?
could
we
sue
20
years
from
now,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's...
you
think
you
could.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
have
been
filed.
my
point,
i
just
wanted
to
make--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
could
have
been
filed
in
1990,
19--
