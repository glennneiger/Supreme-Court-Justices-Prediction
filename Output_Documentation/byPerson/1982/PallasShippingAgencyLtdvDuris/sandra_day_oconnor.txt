mr.
carle,
would
you
agree
that
the
statutory
term
compensation
order
is
a
term
of
art
as
it's
used
elsewhere
in
the
longshoremen's
and
harborworker's
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
brief
indicated
support
for
that
concept
and
i
wondered
if
that
were
true,
why
the
same
meaning
wouldn't
carry
forward
in
section
33(b).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
real
reason
why
the
term
wouldn't
mean
the
same
thing
in
all
sections,
including
this
one.
and
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
i...
the
respondent
and
the
solicitor
general's
position
indicate
that
all
the
respondent's
employer
had
to
do
to
ensure
receipt
of
an
award
in
a
compensation
order
was
to
file
a
notice
of
controversion
and
request
issuance
of
an
award
by
the
deputy
commissioner
and
that
it
didn't
require
a
full
proceeding,
but
that
it
is
possible
to
get
an
award
by
simply
asking
for
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
one
came
as
a
result
of
a
formal
hearing,
which
is
one
way
to
do
it.
but
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
and
the
sg
is
that
under
the
regulations
of
this
act,
you
don't
have
to
go
to
a
formal
hearing,
that
the
employer
can
simply
ask
for
the
formal
award
and
will
receive
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
carle,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interpretation
you
ask
us
to
make
here
would
render
meaningless
the
penalty
provision
in
section
14.
under
that
act,
if
an
employer
stops,
or
fails
to
make
payments
on
time,
and
there's
no
award
by
a
compensation
order,
the
penalty's
only
ten
percent.
but
if
there
is
an
award
by
compensation
order,
the
penalty
is
20
percent.
now
if
your
interpretation
applies,
then
that
section
doesn't
mean
anything.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it's
your
position,
now,
that
just
starting
payments,
making
payments
to
the
employee,
in
effect,
amounts
to
an
award
by
a
compensation
order
under
rule...
section
33.
that
would
mean,
thereafter,
that
any
penalty
after
you
start
payments
is
at
the
20
percent
rate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
don't
need
section
14
to
say
there
are
two
kinds
of
penalties,
the
ten
percent
and
the
twenty
percent
because
you
never
use
the
ten
percent.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your
position
is
that
once
you
make
a
payment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
an
employer,
then
that's
an
award
equivalent
to
an
award
by
a
compensation
order
so,
thereafter,
you
have
only
the
20
percent
penalty
and
you'd
never
reach
the
ten
percent.
you'd
never
need
that,
would
you?
