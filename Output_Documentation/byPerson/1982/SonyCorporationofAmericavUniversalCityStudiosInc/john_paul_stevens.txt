justice
john
paul

mr.
dunlavey,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this
staple
article
of
commerce
issue,
which
of
course
is
mainly
a
patent
problem
normally
in
the
cases.
but
under
your
view,
what
are
the
non
infringing
uses?
obviously,
when
material
is
not
copyrighted
it
wouldn't
be.
and
the
second
are
copyrighted
materials
where
the
copyright
owner
doesn't
care.
and
thirdly
there
are
copyrighted
materials
where
the
copyright
owner
might
care
but
is
not
a
party
to
this
case.
and
then
fourthly
are
universal
and
disney
copyrights.
now,
which
of
those
four
should
we
count
as
non
infringing
uses
within
this
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
to
those
copyrights
where
if
he
were
asked
the
copyright
owner
would
say,
no,
i
don't
want
you
to
make
copies,
you'd
say
that
would
not
be
a
noninfringing
use
within
the
meaning
of
this
doctrine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
saying
it's
limited
to
universal
and
disney
copyrights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
if
you
take
that
legal
position,
then
i
suppose
99
percent
of
the
stuff
is
non
infringing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
haven't
taken
that
position
before,
i
don't
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
on
your
continuing
royalty,
that
would
be
a
royalty
paid
to
universal
and
disney;
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
not
be
true
that
all
other
copyright
owners
who
have
programs
that
go
over
the
tv
would
also
be
entitled
to
a
similar
royalty.
and
you're
a
very
small
portion
of
the
total
copyright
owners,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
suppose
there'd
be
quite
a
few
people
who
would
decide
they
want
to
object
if
you
prevail,
wouldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
mean,
i'm
really
trying
to
understand.
it
is
your
suggestion
that
all
copyright
owners
would
be
entitled
to
a
royalty
from
the
manufacturer
of
betamax
because
it's
sold
primarily,
as
you
suggest,
for
infringing
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kroft,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
here.
do
you
think
the
legal
issue
would
be
different
if
instead
of
it
being
video
tape
recorder
it
were
just
tape
recording
of
music
programs,
say,
strictly
sound?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
just
in
the
infringement,
forgetting
the
contributory
infringement,
which
would
be
quite
different,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
just
was
trying
to
find
out
whether
you
thought
the
issue
was
different.
i
understand
what
your
view
would
be
on
the
merits
of
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
applying
the
statutory
language
in
the
fair
use
section,
wouldn't
it
apply
the
same
as
to
the
infringement
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this,
then.
on
the
first
of
the
four
statutory
requirements
of
fair
use,
do
you
think
that,
just
confining
it
to
that
for
a
moment,
that
the
private
copying
within
the
home
is
of
a
commercial
nature
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
for
time
shift
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
it
can
have
commercial
ramifications.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
the
economics
of
it.
but
do
you
think
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
it
would
be
regarded
as
commercial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question,
about
the
fourth
prong
of
the
statute.
do
the
findings
answer
the
question
on
this
record
whether
the...
what
the
effect
on
the
potential
market
for
your
copyrighted
materials
is?
is
it
plus
or
minus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
there
are
arguments
why
you
would
be
harmed
and
there
are
also
arguments
to
the
contrary.
and
what
i
am
really
asking
is,
do
you
think
that
one
can
read
the
district
court's
opinion
as
saying
what
the
net
result
is
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
couldn't
myself
and
i
just
was
wondering
what
your
view
was.
