mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
person
who
receives
a
free
off
the
air
television
broadcast
in
his
home
by
use
of
a
video
tape
recorder,
as
distinguished
from
a
television
set,
is
thereby
committing
direct
copyright
infringement
on
the
program
that
he
is
receiving.
now,
in
this
case
no
remedy
is
sought
against
any
so
called
direct
infringer,
but
the
ninth
circuit
has
answered
the
question
yes,
and
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
upheld
then
there
are
some
five
million
plus
video
tape
recorder
owners
who
will
be
at
the
mercy
of
any
copyright
owner
who
seeks
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation.
the
second
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
there
has
been
contributory
copyright
infringement
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
and
bear
in
mind
that
they
are
the
manufacturer,
the
american
distributor,
and
the
american
national
advertiser
of
a
video
tape
recorder
whose
brand
name
is
betamax.
again,
the
ninth
circuit
has
answered
that
question
yes,
and
universal
has
moved
immediately
to
exploit
the
situation
by
filing
a
second
action
in
the
ninth
circuit
against
some
50
additional
vtr
suppliers,
and
also
has
filed
a
second
suit
against
the
same
petitioners
in
this
action
alleging
that,
on
information
and
belief,
one
or
more
video
tape...
one
or
more
betamax
owners
has
copied
every
single
production
that
universal
has
put
on
television
since
genesis
and
must
account
for
that
in
statutory
damages.
now,
the
pernicious
point
in
the
contributory
infringement
aspect
is
that
universal
is
seeking
either
an
injunction...
and
they
are
dead
serious
about
it...
an
injunction
against
the
video
tape
recorder
and/or
statutory
damages.
and
when
we
talk
statutory
damages,
it's
$250
for
every
owner
for
every
program,
and
that's
the
financial
liability
that
they
seek
to
assess
upon
the
petitioners.
so
it
only
takes
common
sense
to
realize
that
the
ultimate
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
current
law
all
americans
are
going
to
be
denied
the
benefit
of
time
shift
home
television
viewing
because
a
few
program
owners
object.
if
there
is
to
be
time
shift
viewing,
and
by
that
i
mean
a
viewing
of
a
program
at
some
time
not
too
long
after
the
broadcast,
then
manifestly
there
has
to
be
a
record
of
that
program
to
exist
between
the
time
of
the
broadcast
and
the
time
of
the
viewing.
in
this
case
that
something
is
a
video
tape.
it,
by
definition
of
congress
at
least,
is
a
copy,
and
thereby
comes
the
rub,
because
the
copyright
law
says
that
only
the
copyright
owner
has
the
right
to
make
a
copy
of
his
copyrighted
work,
unless
of
course
he
gives
consent.
so
the
direct
infringement
question
here
is
whether
that
copy
that
exists
in
the
form
of
the
videotape
between
the
broadcast
and
the
playback
is
an
infringing
copy
or
is
it
an
example
of
fair
use.
there
is
no
problem
with
the
playback.
the
playback
is
authorized
specifically
by
statute.
the
problem
lies
with
the
copy.
the
case
has
been
presented
by
the
respondents
through
four
individual
owners.
now,
three
of
those
owners
really
are
atypical
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
american
public.
one
of
them
had
100
tapes,
one
of
them
had
170
tapes,
one
of
them
had
340
tapes...
all
this
at
a
time
when
the
norm
was
30
tapes.
amongst
those
four,
however,
there
is
a
commonality
that
gives
the
issue
to
the
court
this
morning.
whatever
else
they
did,
they
copied
32
programs
that
belonged
either
to
universal
or
to
disney.
nothing
else;
the
issues
to
this
case
reside
solely
within
those
32
copies.
each
of
these
persons
made
his
copy
at
home.
there
is
no
commercial
aspect
of
it.
it
never
got
out
of
his
house.
it
was
only
intended
for
his
use
and
perhaps
his
friends
in
a
couple
of
instances,
and
the
usage
was
singularly
of
the
kind
we
call
time
shift.
as
the
opinion
states,
it's
the
recording,
the
holding
for
a
short
period
of
time,
then
watching
and
then
erasing,
and
the
erasing
is
automatic
as
you
record
something
else.
because
of
the
trial
judge's
wishes,
there
are
surveys
in
the
case.
they
have
to
do
with
the
use
of
the
betamax
generally
by
the
persons
who
were
surveyed.
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
none
of
those
surveys
has
anything
to
do
with
the
particular
works
which
have
been
infringed
allegedly.
none
of
those
surveys
pertains
to
respondents'
work
at
all,
neither
those
in
issue
nor
of
any
other
kind.
and
again
specifically,
none
of
those
surveys
shows
any
librarying
of
respondents'
work.
now,
librarying
is
the
other
kind
of
home
use
that
creeps
into
the
case.
if
a
person
keeps
his
tape
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time...
and
that's
never
been
defined...
and
looks
at
it
for
a
number
of
times...
and
the
number
has
never
been
defined...
then
at
least
theoretically
there
becomes
a
time
when
he
becomes
saturated
with
that
program.
but
if
that
happens,
it's
outside
of
this
case,
because
it
is
not
a
factor
as
to
any
of
the
32
works
that
are
in
issue.
the
trial
judge's
only
comments,
a
summarization
of
his
comments
with
respect
to
librarying,
was
simply
that
it
has
not
been
proven
that
many
persons
will
library
to
any
significant
extent.
the
trial
judge
also
ruled
out
certain
additional
uses
that
can
be
made
of
these
tapes
if
the
owner
is
so
inclined.
you
can
duplicate
them,
theoretically.
that
is,
once
you've
got
one
tape
you
can
make
a
copy
from
it.
or
you
can
record
from
pay
television.
or,
having
made
your
copy,
you
can
take
it
outside
the
home
for
one
purpose
or
another.
or
you
can
swap.
all
of
those
things
are
theoretically
possible,
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
any
of
that
was
done
with
respect
to
any
of
the
respondents'
works.
so
the
trial
judge
specifically
said,
there
are
problems
inherent
in
modern
technology
that
are
not
in
this
case
and
that
this
case
does
not
purport
to
resolve.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
it
is
possible,
but
it's
not
in
the
evidence.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
no.
as
far
as
the
ninth
circuit
is
concerned,
the
number
of
times
it's
run
is
immaterial.
the
infringement
occurs
instantly
that
the
copy
is
made.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
the
copy
per
se
is
the
infringement.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
could
it?
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
yes,
it
could.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
one
can
only
find
out
what's
going
on
with
surveys.
the
surveys...
if
you
get
outside
the
evidence,
and
i
don't
want
to
do
that
because
my
emphasis
is
to
stay
within
the
evidence.
if
you
get
outside
the
evidence,
librarying
is
on
the
decrease
because
these
prerecorded
copies
are
being
made
available,
which
are
better
and
they
serve
the
purpose.
librarying
also
is
something
that
the
owner
first
thinks
of
when
he
buys
his
machine.
here
he's
got
a
device
for
built
in
home
entertainment.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
turns
out
to
be
very
expensive,
and
even
one
or
two
of
our
owners
in
issue
bought
with
the
intent
of
librarying
and
then
said
specifically
that
they
didn't.
so
could
it
take
place?
yes,
but
in
fact
it's
decreasing.
now,
looking
at
the
betamax...
and
realize
there's
only
one
public
television
game
going
on
in
this
country,
everybody
has
to
abide
by
the
same
rules,
so
in
trying
to
find
out
what
kind
of
a
machine
is
being
sold,
the
district
court
looked
at
evidence
of
a
number
of
kinds
of
uses
of
this
machine,
which
where
clearly
not
infringement,
or
the
owners
of
the
copyright
who
might
have
otherwise
said
it
was
infringement
instead
said
they
consented
to
it.
many
program
owners,
in
addition
to
the
public
in
general,
are
in
favor
of
betamax,
because
many
program
owners
would
rather
be
seen
as
a
second
choice
sometime
later
than
to
be
missed
entirely.
the
trial
judge
said
that
this
was
a
staple
item
of
commerce,
that
it
was
suitable
for
a
variety
of
non
infringing
uses,
and
in
that
finding,
he
had
all
kinds
of
backed
up
evidence,
because
we
had
specific
owners
of
various
kinds
of
programs,
who
said
that
they
did
not
object
to
or
consented
to
the
recording.
without
wasting
time
on
the
details,
they
included
sports
program
copyright
owners,
religious
owners,
childrens'
programming
owners,
entertainment
programming
owners,
and
as
an
aside,
the
american
broadcasting
company
right
now
is
on
the
verge
of
broadcasting
programs
at
night,
or
early
in
the
morning,
really,
from
2
a.m.
to
6
a.m.,
intended
for
reception
with
a
vtr
so
somebody
can
watch
them
later
on
during
waking
hours.
and
there
were
also
educational
programs.
and
although
universal
prevailed
upon
the
court
to
find
that
there
was
no
legitimate
use
for
the
betamax...
on
the
ninth
circuit
court...
universal
itself
is
a
signatory
to
an
agreement
called
guidelines,
which
is
a
type
of
agreement
between
copyright
owners
and
educators.
it
has
been
given
the
dignity
in
the
house
committee
report
and
sanctioned
by
the
senate
committee,
the
conference
committee
report
that
followed
it,
that
what
they
could
agree
upon
would
be
deemed
a
fair
use.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
yes,
it
was.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
the
court
of
appeals
rolled
over
it
like
it
wasn't
even
there.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--the
court
of
appeals
really
didn't
apply
the
clearly
erroneous
test
at
all.
it
ignored
the
findings.
it
didn't
take
a
single
finding
and
say
that
this
finding
is
wrong.
it
simply
substituted
its
own
impressions
in
every
respect.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
judge
kilkenny
said
that
the
machine
was
not
suitable
for
substantial
non
infringing
use.
but
to
the
extent
that
he
gave
any
reason
for
it,
it
was
that
all
broadcast
programs
now
can
be
copyrighted,
from
the
time
they're
broadcast
at
least,
and
since
the
betamax
is
intended
to
record
a
television
program,
ergo
it
must
follow
that
it
was
designed
only
to
copy
something
that
was
copyrighted.
what
the
ninth
circuit
missed
was
that
there
are
a
lot
of
copyright
owners,
far
more
than
those
who
object
in
fact,
who
consent
to
copying.
yes,
they
may
have
copyrights,
but
they
have
agreed
that
the
betamax
may
copy
it.
also,
there's
another
category
of
copyright
owner,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
who
might
have
had
copyright
protection,
but
before
he
can
bring
an
infringement
suit
he
has
to
register
his
work
and
thereby
lay
the
groundwork
for
having
an
infringement
suit
to
follow
it.
no
registration,
no
infringement.
and
there
are
a
number
of
stations
around
the
country
which
don't
go
to
the
trouble
of
registering
or
copyrighting
their
programs.
they
use
their
tape
for
one
broadcast
and
then
turn
around
and
reuse
it
for
another.
they
have
decided,
apparently,
that
it's
not
worthwhile
copyrighting
it.
it
is
our
contention
that
those
people
have
knowingly
forfeited
their
right
to
enjoin
home
recording,
and
that
that
kind
of
programming,
even
without
their
specific
consent,
is
also
a
legitimate
use.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
the
answer
is
yes,
it
has
been
alluded
to
in
the
copyright
area,
but
it
was
a
long
time
ago.
it
was
justice
holmes
in
the
kalem
case,
and
he
was
confronted
with
a
motion
picture
which
had
been
made
without
authority
of
a
copyrighted
book
called
"ben
hur".
and
nobody
even
questioned
that
the
makers
of
the
camera
and
the
film
were
infringers,
but
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
the
person
who
had
made
the
film
was
a
contributory
infringer
when
the
person
he
gave
it
to
exhibited
it...
exhibited
it.
and
justice
holmes
made
a
very
terse
but
pointed
comment
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
in
society
that
when
you
sell
them
they
might
be
useable
for
a
wrongful
purpose,
and
you
set
your
mind
to
inquiring
when
the
man
makes
and
sells
that
product,
does
he
really
have
cause
to
know
that
it's
going
to
be
used
for
a
wrongful
purpose?
so
the
staple
item
concept
came
up.
justice
holmes
said
that
if
you
have
an
indifferent
supposition,
that
the
buyer
might
be
going
to
use
your
product
for
a
wrongful
purpose,
that
certainly
does
not
suffice
to
make
you
a
contributory
infringer.
by
the
same
token,
if
you're
selling
something
that's
a
staple
item
of
commerce...
and
by
definition
that
is
something
that
has
got
legitimate
uses...
then
you
as
a
manufacturer
cannot
have
the
buyer's
motive
imputed
to
you.
that's
where
the
staple
item
is
important.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
and
the
distributor
and
the
advertiser.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
there
are
so
many
legitimate
uses
to
which
this
machine
can
be
put
that
it's
grossly
unfair
to
hold
the
manufacturer
if
somebody
misapplies
it,
assuming
that
it
is
a
misapplication.
now,
the
other
thing
of
course
that
the
supplier--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--if
it
were
the
case
that
no
substantial
number
of
copyright
owners
wanted
their
televised
programs
copied,
then
the
argument
that
i
have
just
made
wouldn't
have
much
weight
to
it.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
that's
right,
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
the
only
two
people
in
the
whole
country
who
had
ever
brought
an
action
to
try
and
prevent
the
use
of
the
vtr
were
the
two
respondents
today,
and
that's
still
the
fact.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
those
are
copyrighted.
this
doctrine
really
doesn't
reach
that
point
because
one
of
the
facets
of
the
vtr
in
home
reception
off
the
air
is
its
aspect
to
record
a
program
being
broadcast.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
have
surmised
that
the
man
was
given
a
copy
with
the
consent
of
the
copyright
owner
to
begin
with,
and
that
takes
us
out
of
the
field
of
this
case.
now,
the
other
aspects
of
contributory--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--not
with
respect
to
the
particular
alleged
infringements
in
issue.
there
were
advertisements.
they
did
get
into
evidence.
but
nobody
who
made
any
of
the
recordings
in
issue
saw
or
was
influenced
by
them.
so
whatever
those
advertisements
were,
they
are
not
germane
to
the
infringement
in
issue.
and
needless
to
say,
once
the
litigation
started
sony's
advertisements
were
toned
down
markedly
so
that
they
didn't
induce
somebody
into
the
wrong
kind
of
usages.
now,
the
other
half
of
contribution,
or
contributory
infringement,
is
did
you
induce
or
cause
somebody
to
do
the
direct
infringement,
and
the
district
court
said,
no,
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
ads
or
statements
by
any
of
the
petitioners
in
any
way
induced
or
caused
the
copying
that
took
place.
the
district
court
also
held
the
obvious,
that
there
is
no
right,
no
ability
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
to
control
the
use
of
the
betamax
once
it's
bought
and
taken
home.
on
the
other
hand,
the
ninth
circuit
did
the
same
thing
that
it
did
throughout.
it
simply
said
ipse
dixit
that
there
is
"no
doubt"
that
petitioners
induced
or
caused
this
direct
infringement.
it
also
said
that
petitioners
are
sufficiently
engaged
in
the
enterprise
to
be
held
accountable.
no
explanation.
as
a
side
matter
on
this
inducement,
sony
has
put
in
every
betamax
carton
a
printed
warning
to
the
buyer
that
the
unauthorized
recording
of
copyright
programs
may
be
contrary
to
copyright
laws.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
that's
true,
he
does
not
see
it
'til
he's
unwrapped
it.
but
he
does
see
it
before
he
uses
it,
if
he
reads
it.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
no.
that
kind
of
warning
has
been
in
betamax
from
day
one,
from
before
the
litigation.
and
i
mention
it
because
there's
an
analogy
in
the
copyright
act,
section
108(f),
which
says
that
if
libraries
will
give
that
kind
of
a
warning
to
their
patrons
when
they
enjoy
unsupervised
use
of
the
library
xerox
machine
then
the
library
will
not
have
contributory
liability.
now,
as
we
tell
these
consumers
to
be
careful,
the
respondents
are
coming
right
along
behind
us
and
telling
the
public
that
they
don't
ever
have
to
worry
about
being
sued,
at
least
not
by
universal
and
disney.
so
as
fast
as
we
tell
them
to
be
careful,
respondents
in
effect
are
telling
them
that
they'll
never
have
any
trouble
directly
from
respondents.
the
gist
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
that
each
petitioner
is
contributorily
liable
for
each
instance
where
a
betamax
owner
makes
a
copyright...
makes
a
copy
of
a
copyrighted
program
where
the
owner
objects,
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
that
the
article
is
a
staple
item--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--and
that
we
didn't
do
a
single
thing
to
affirmatively
induce
the
copying
of
respondents'
programs,
unless
you
want
to
count
the
bare
act
of
making
the
machine.
there
was
nothing
between
any
of
the
petitioners
and
the
respondents--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--if
you
know
that
the
machine
is
going
to
be
used
and
know
that
the
use
is
to
be
infringing,
that
is
a
facet
of
a
contributory
infringement
test.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
the
district
court
goes
back
to
the
point
that
there
is
so
much
material
where
it's
acceptable
to
copy
that
you
don't
have
to
anticipate
a
particular
wrongful
use.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
is
not
charged
with
enough
knowledge
to
make
it
a
contributory
infringer,
yes.
as
holmes,
justice
holmes,
said,
an
indifferent
supposition
doesn't
do
it.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--the
latter.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
take
issue
with
any
finding
of
the
district
judge
per
se.
it
simply
substituted
its
own
findings,
like
there
had
been
a
whole
new
trial
in
absentia
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
it
had
reached
its
own
conclusions.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
you
should...
i
would
urge
you
to
consider,
justice
stevens,
as
non
infringing
uses
the
cases
where
the
copyright
owner
consents;
the
case
where
the
copyright
owner
has
forfeited
his
right
to
an
infringement
action
by
putting
it
beyond
his
power
any
longer
to
register
his
work;
also,
the
work
which
is
not
copyrightable
from
the
outset,
and
that
includes,
for
example,
government
produced
matters;
and
there
are
also
matters
where
copyright
has
expired.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
if
he
says--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--that's
a
very
interesting
point,
justice
stevens,
and
you're
getting
now
to
where
public
policy
mixes
with
the
copyright
owner's
rights.
i
would
say
that
if
the
copyright
owner
says,
i'd
rather
you
didn't
do
it
but
i
don't
care
enough
to
sue
you
about
it,
then
i
would
say
that
the
public's
interest
in
having
access
to
the
information
should
take
precedence
over
his--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--and
that's
about
where
this
case
is
right
now.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
we
have
taken
the
position
that
if
it
hasn't
been
challenged,
if
it
hasn't
been
challenged
with
a
suit
to
stop
it,
that
it's
been
free
for
unchallenged
recording.
that's
been
our
language.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
cannot
give
you
a--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--i
don't
disagree
with
that,
and
the--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--they
would
be
copyrightable,
yes.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
perhaps
not.
and
then
the
stations
that
produce
their
programming
and
don't
bother
to
copyright
it.
we
know
that
there
is
some
27
hours
a
week
coming
out
of
the
average
local
station
that
fits
that
description.
what
proportion
is
i
don't
know,
but
that's
the
ratio...
that's
the
absolute.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
the
copyright
within
the
copyright
presents
a
problem.
i
think
we'd
have
to
say
that
the
copyright
owner
of
the
broadcast
program--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--yes.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
those
people
have
come
out
of
the
weeds
in
just
the
last
couple
of
weeks.
[laughter]
i'm
sorry.
but
we
didn't
have
that
to
contend
with
at
trial.
there
is
the
problem
of
copyrighted
work
within
copyrighted
works.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
in
the
limited
time
i
have
left:
as
far
as
fair
use
is
concerned--
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
--yes,
i
realize
and
i'm
afraid
i'm
going
to
have
to
expend
it.
as
to
fair
use
itself,
there
was
one
point
that
the
district
court
emphasized
and
that
we
emphasized,
that
the
direct...
that
the
copying
itself
should
not
be
direct
infringement,
and
that
is
that
these
people
have
put
their
programs
on
television
intentionally,
with
the
purpose
that
anybody
who
has
the
means
of
doing
it
can
receive
it,
and
that's
all
that's
happened.
now,
those
people
by
definition
have
given
their
implied
consent
to
reception.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
it's
more
like
the
publisher,
justice
rehnquist,
who,
having
put
his
book
in
the
bookstore,
knows
that
whoever
buys
it
can
then
read
it,
give
it
to
a
friend.
he
knows
what's
going
to
happen
to
it.
but
when
you
broadcast
you
know
that
everybody
within
reach
of
that
station's
signal
has
got
the
right
to
receive
that
signal.
mr.
dean
c.
dunlavey
i
do
not
know,
and
i
don't
think
there
was
ever
a
case
until
now
that
would
answer
that
question.
personal
use
has
been
urged
by
the
solicitor
general
back
in
the
fortnightly-teleprompter
area,
that
personal
use,
copying
for
personal
use
should
be
permitted,
that
it
was
never
intended
to
be
within
the
gamut
of
the
copyright
statute.
now,
the
other
half
of
the
coin
fair
use,
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
fair
use
by
definition
has
to
be
a
productive
use.
unless
you
are
creating
a
second
work
by
relying
upon
the
first,
by
definition
you
can't
have
fair
use.
and
that
is
manifestly
wrong,
because
universal,
having
agreed
to
this
educational
off
the
air
recording,
has
agreed
that
100
percent
copying
for
the
same
kind
of
use
that
the
film
was
intended
for
is
fair
use.
the
points
that
i'm
not
going
to
reach,
and
i'll
have
to
pay
the
price
for
it:
legislative
history
has
been
covered
in
the
brief,
and
argument
i
feel
can
add
nothing
to
it.
the
compulsory
royalty,
that's
something
that
is
not
provided
by
the
statute.
thank
you.
