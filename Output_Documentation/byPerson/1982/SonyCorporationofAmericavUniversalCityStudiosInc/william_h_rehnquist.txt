william

rehnquist
mr.
dunlavey,
this
was
a
finding
of
fact,
was
it,
by
the
district
court,
that
it
was
a
staple
of
commerce?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
upset
that
finding
of
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
must
be
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
what,
misapplied
the
clearly
erroneous
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
certainly
got
the
impression
from
reading
judge
kilkenny's
opinion
that
the
opinion
said
in
effect
this
finding
was
wrong.
i
realize,
he
didn't
say
in
so
many
words
it
was
"clearly
erroneous".
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
district
court
make
a
finding
that
the
package
was
delivered
to
the
purchaser
with
that
thing
wrapped
up
inside
so
he'd
never
see
it
until
after
he
got
it
home?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
like
saying
a
publisher
puts
his
book
in
a
bookstore
and
so,
no,
he
should
have
no
objection
to
people
making
a
lot
of
xerox
copies
of
the
book.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
a
book
publisher
publishes
a
book,
i
buy
it
as
an
individual,
i
make
three
xerox
copies
because
i've
got
an
office,
a
house
here
in
washington,
and
maybe
a
summer
cabin,
i
want
to
have
a
copy
in
each
place.
am
i
guilty
of
infringement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
six
runs
means
six
times
through
from
beginning
to
end
of
the
series?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there'd
be
a
very
substantially
reduced
demand
for
television
sets
if
there
weren't
any
network
television,
too.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
lot
of
sports
programs
are
copyrighted.
at
least
they
announce
that
they
are.
