justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say,
mr.
dunlavey,
if
every
program
that
came
over
television
was
not
only
copyrighted,
but
the
copyright
owners
didn't
want
their
programs
copied
on
a
betamax?
let's
just
assume
that.
then
what
about
the
contributor?
what
about
the
betamax
manufacturer?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
so
you
think
in
this
record
there's
enough
evidence
to
support
the
notion
that
a
majority
of
the
programs
on
the
air
will
not
cause
the
betamax
user
any
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dunlavey,
what
findings
did
the
district
court
make
that
you
think
protects
sony
from
being
held
a
contributory
infringer?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
first
one.
what's
the
next
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
rule...
is
it
the
rule
that
if
you
know
the
machine
is
going
to
be
used
for
an
infringing
use
and
you
sell
it,
is
that
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
district
court...
did
the
district
court
make
any
findings
in
that
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
so
he
couldn't
have...
he
couldn't
have...
there
was
so
much
non
copyrighted
material
or
so
much
material
whose
owners
didn't
really
care
that
sony
couldn't
have
known?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the...
did
the
court
of
appeals
take
issue
with
this
particular
part
of
the
court's
finding--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
just
ignored
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
copyrightable,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
station
that
produces
a
show
but
doesn't
copyright
the
show,
but
in
the
show
is
a
musical
composition
that's
copyrighted?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
there
are
amicus
briefs
filed
here
by--
justice
byron
r.
white
--composers.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
anybody
ever
tried
to
stop
it
when
it's
done
in
the
home?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
never
been
a
case
where
there
has
been
a
copying
in
the
home
before
of
a
motion
picture?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
other
copyrighted
works
that
are
reproduced
in
the
home
for
personal
use?
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
have
involved
that
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
happens
a
good
deal
in
connection
with
a
lot
of
copyrighted
work?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
isn't
a
finding
of
fact
then
it's
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
characterize
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
finding
that
the
district
court
didn't
make,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
one
way
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
kind
of
a
finding
was
relevant,
i
take
it,
why,
i
would
have
thought
it
might
have
remanded
to
the
district
court
to...
if
the
district
court
used
the
wrong
standard
or
didn't
make
the
findings
that
it
should
have,
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
make
its
findings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
long
as
you
don't
call
the
staple
article
finding
a
finding
of
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
disagree
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kroft,
let
me
ask,
suppose
it
were
perfectly
clear
that
50
percent
of
the
material
was
not
copyrighted
or
copyrightable
that
was
coming
over
the
air
and
50
percent
was,
and
that
all
the
50
percent
of
the
owners
of
the
copyright
would
object.
now,
suppose
that
that
were
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
would
satisfy
the
requirements
of
showing
a
contributory
infringement,
if
you
just
knew
that
it
was
possible?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
think
they've
paid
for
it,
too.
