o'connor
mr.
dunlavey,
what
are
the
practical
effects
of
finding
that
it's
a
staple
item
of
commerce?
and
that's
a
doctrine
that
was
developed
in
the
patent
field.
are
there
cases
that
have
adapted
it
to
the
copyright
area?
and
as
a
practical
matter
what
would
be
the
effect
of
such
a
finding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
your
view
that
would
protect
both
the
manufacturers
and
the
retailers
and
wholesalers?
justice
sandra

o'connor
distributors.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kroft,
was
the
district
court
finding
that
the
items
were
staple
items
of
commerce
a
finding
of
fact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kroft,
what
affect
does
the
mere
delayed
viewing,
as
opposed
to
librarying
use,
the
mere
effect
of
delayed
viewing
have
on
the
value
of
the
copyrighted
work?
i
mean,
presumably
the
copyright
owner
has
made
arrangements
to
have
the
program
put
out
over
the
air
waves
for
people
to
see.
and
the
mere
delayed
viewing
of
the
copyrighted
work,
how
does
that
affect
the
market?
