if
the
use
was
time
shifting
today,
could
it
not
be
librarying
tomorrow?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.

and
how
would
one
know,
really?

mr.
kroft,
may
i
ask
a
hypothetical.
assume
that
a
film
is
copied
solely
for
use
in
a
drama
class
at
college.
would
that
be
a
fair
use?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
that
be
close
to
williams
against
wilkins?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
copying
there
was
for
a
scientific
use.
would
it
really
be
different
for
use
in
a
drama
class
in
a
college,
for
educational
use?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i'll
ask
you
the
easy
one.
i
have
the
same
film
for
use
at
my
clerks
reunion.
would
that
be
fair
use?
