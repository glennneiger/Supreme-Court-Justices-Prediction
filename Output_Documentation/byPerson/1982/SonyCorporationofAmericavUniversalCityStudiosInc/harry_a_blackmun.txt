mr.
dunlavey,
you
keep
using
the
word
"theoretically".
i
suppose
it's
really
possible,
as
opposed
to
just
theoretically
possible.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
evidence
in
this
record,
isn't
there,
particularly
about
the
early
advertising
on
the
part
of
sony
that
indicated
that,
copyright
or
not,
this
machine
could
produce
this
for
use
and
the
like?
in
other
words,
there
is
some
evidence
against
your
position.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
when
was
this
program
instituted?
after
the
litigation
began?
