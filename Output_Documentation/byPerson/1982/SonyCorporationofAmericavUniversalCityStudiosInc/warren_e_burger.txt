e.

before
we
hear
the
arguments
in
sony
corporation
against
universal
city
studios,
in
case
counsel
were
not
in
the
courtroom
at
10:00
o'clock
this
morning,
i'm
authorized
to
announce
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
unavoidably
absent,
attending
the
funeral
of
a
member
of
his
family,
and
he
will
participate
in
these
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
papers
and
the
recording,
the
tape
recording
of
the
oral
arguments.
[laughter]
mr.
dunlavey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
not
make
any
difference,
mr.
dunlavey,
whether
it
was
used
once
or
25
times
under
the
ninth
circuit's
holding,
the
second
run?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
copy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
these
cassettes
that
are
rented?
people
don't
want
to
pay
a
babysitter,
so
they
rent
a
cassette
and
have
a
movie
at
home.
are
those
generally
copyrighted,
so
that
this
doctrine
would
apply
to
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
have
mentioned
the
figure
i
missed
it.
what
proportion,
if
it
is
known,
of
all
the
programs
that
are
broadcast
are
not
copyrighted
or
not
copyrightable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
should
know,
but
i
don't,
for
example,
whether
national
geographic
society
programs
are
copyrighted
by
them.
since
they're
educational,
i
would
take
a
wild
guess
that
they'd
have
no
objection
to
their
being
copied
for
private
use.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
copyrighted,
but
perhaps
not
copyrighted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
realize
you're
into
your
rebuttal
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kroft.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
use
the
term
"case"
in
terms
of
a
litigated
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
the
manufacturer
know
that
it
is
going
to
be
so
used,
and
if
so
how
frequently?
how
would
you
measure
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
hypothesize
any
kind
of
proof
that
would
give
you
any
rational
measure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
samples
out
of
the
millions
of
machines
were
there
in
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
a
copying
machine,
xerox,
ibm
or
whatever,
advertised
that
this
was
a
good
way
to
make
copies
of
books
for
private
use,
taking
the
hypothetical
that
justice
rehnquist
suggested
to
you,
is
there
any
analogy
to
this
situation
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
take
the
hypothesis
that
they
do
not
advertise
it.
is
there
any
literate
person
in
the
united
states
who
doesn't
know
that
you
can
make
copies
of
books
on
a
xerox
or
an
ibm
or
any
other
copier,
without
being
told
in
ads
that
that's
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
the
householder
to
know,
how
is
it
going
to
find
out,
if
he
has
one
of
these
gadgets
and
wants
to
make
a
copy?
let's
say
it's
a
national
geographic
or
a
smithsonian,
and
assume
for
the
moment
that
they
have
no
objection
to
being
copied,
or
whether
it's
something
where
your
clients
would
object.
how
are
they
going
to
find
out?
must
they
assume
that
everything
is
copyrighted
and
that
copying
is
forbidden
unless
some
announcement
is
made
that
it's
open
to
copy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
there
some
requirement
that
copyrighted
material
must
be
identified
as
such
in
order
to
have
its
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that...
does
that
go
beyond
the
time
when
the
copyright
may
be
applied
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you,
while
we've
got
you
stopped:
i
can
see
the
point
of
some
conceivable
damage,
the
injury,
where
it
is
libraried,
in
this
verbalizing,
verbing,
making
a
verb
out
of
that
noun,
"librarying".
but
you're
going
to
be
out
for
dinner
at
7:00
o'clock
when
there's
a
program
on
and
then
you
want
to
see
it
when
you
get
home
at
11:00
or
12:00
or
the
next
evening.
where's
the
injury
and
how
do
you
measure
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
is
an
injury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
all,
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
use
the
term
"unscrupulous",
do
you
include
the
time
shift
users?
you're
perfectly
free,
because
i
don't
have
one
of
these
things.
[laughter]
is
that
an
unscrupulous
user?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
sony
corporation
of
america
against
universal
studios
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
