mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
the
technology
involved
in
this
case
makes
the
case
more
interesting
than
the
normal
copyright
case,
all
that
the
case
really
involves
is
unauthorized
and
uncompensated
copying
of
entire
motion
pictures,
and
that's
something
that's
never
been
permitted
by
the
copyright
act.
neither
congress
nor
any
court
has
ever
permitted
such
copying,
merely
because
it
takes
place
in
the
home
rather
than
someplace
else,
or
because
the
copy
is
taken
from
the
television
air
waves
rather
than
from
some
other
source.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
ever
come
up
before
this
case.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
am
not
aware
of
any
case
where
there's
been
copying
in
the
home
before
this
case,
your
honor.
and
i
have
diligently
searched.
i
hope
i
have
been
diligent
enough.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
a
litigated
case
or
to
my
knowledge
an
unlitigated
situation.
before
betamax
came
on
the
market,
while
there
were
some
aborted
attempts
to
try
to
sell
home
video
recorders,
sony
executives
in
the
trial
below
all
admitted
that
they
failed.
so
as
far
as
i'm
aware,
the
only
home
video
recorder
that
came
to
market
and
stayed
here
for
more
than
a
fleeting
moment
was
betamax.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
think
that
there
is
no
such
case,
no
litigated
case
where
that's
come
up,
justice
white.
not
that
i'm
aware
of--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--your
honor,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
whether
it
happens
a
good
deal
or
not.
but
i
would
say
that
if
other
copyright
owners
have
sat
on
their
rights,
we've
been
diligent
and
we
shouldn't
be
penalized
because
they
have
sat
on
their
rights.
we
haven't.
both
congress
and
the
courts
have
recognized
that
there
are
property
rights
involved
here
with
these
copyrighted
motion
pictures.
we're
not
talking
about
something
of
no
value.
congress
recognized
this
value
as
far
back
as
1912
and
it
continued
to
emphasize
this
value
when
it
passed
the
new
copyright
statute
in
1976.
now,
before
i
get
into
the
legal
issues
i'd
like
to
emphasize
three
overriding
facts
that
pervade
this
case
and
i
think
they
must
be
brought
out
early.
first,
it's
got
to
be
emphasized
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed
it
is
not
true
that
absolutely
all
future
sales
of
video
tape
recorders
will
be
banned
from
this
country
forever.
as
we've
stated
in
our
briefs,
there
are
several
alternate
remedies
that
are
available,
and
i
think
are
even
likely
when
the
district
court
finally
gets
to
the
remedy
issue
on
remand.
one
such
remedy,
for
example,
would
be
the
continuing
royalty
suggested
by
the
ninth
circuit.
it
could
be
accomplished
by
withholding
a
permanent
injunction
on
the
condition
that
sony
and
the
petitioners
pay
a
license
fee
to
the
respondents
for
the
continued
use
of
their
works.
in
fact,
this
is
something
that
sony's
own
president
advocated
six
years
ago,
shortly
after
this
lawsuit--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of
proof
put
before
the
district
court
in
the
form
of
surveys
and
other
evidence.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
surveys
in
this
record,
although
they
weren't
taken
or
devised
for
the
purpose
of
getting
at
this
issue,
which
show
the
types
of
programs
that
are
being
copied.
they
didn't
ask
about
them
by
title,
but
they
showed,
for
example,
that
over
80
percent
of
what's
being
copied
are
entertainment
programs.
now,
i
suppose
all
you
need
to
do
is
ask
another
question
which
says,
give
us
the
titles
of
what
you've
copied.
then
you'd
know
exactly
how
many
universal
and
disney
motion
pictures
have
been--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--there
were
two
samples...
excuse
me.
before
the
lawsuit
was
filed
sony
did
its
own
marketing
survey,
which
consisted
of
just
a
few
hundred
people
and
showed,
for
example,
substantial
librarying
and
deletion
of
commercials
from
broadcasts.
after
the
litigation
was
filed,
there
were
two
surveys
taken
by
the
parties
at
the
district
court's
request,
each
of
which
was
based
basically
on
a
1,000
sample
each.
now,
they
were
random
samples,
so
i
believe
they
were
probably
different
samples.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
that's
what
i'm
suggesting.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
we
may
be
a
small
portion
ourselves,
your
honor,
but
we
are
not
a
small
portion
of
those
who
have
taken
a
position
as
to
whether
they
object
or
don't
object
to
off
the
air
recording.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
well,
there
are
quite
a
few
people
who
have
already
objected,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
think
if
we
get
that
royalty
and
this
court
affirms
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
royalty
is
affirmed,
as
i
believe
it
would
be
and
should
be,
i
think
i
have
to
say
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
your
honor,
it
may
have
been
a
finding
of
fact,
but
it
was
an
incomplete
finding
if
it
was
a
finding
of
fact.
because
if
you
analogize
to
the
patent
statute,
which
we
strenuously
resist
here,
the
patent
statute
requires
that
not
only
must
the
product
be
a
so
called
staple
article
of
commerce,
but
it
must
be
suitable
for
substantial
non
infringing
uses.
and
the
cases
have
put
a
gloss
on
that
requirement
and
said
that
that
may
not
just
be
a
theoretical
non
infringing
use,
but
these
substantial
non
infringing
uses
must
also
be
actual
non
infringing
uses,
actual
uses
found
of
the
product.
the
district
court
very
pointedly
did
not
find
that
betamax
is
suitable
for
substantial
non
infringing
use.
and
i
think
if
you'll
at
petitioner's
appendix
at
page
97,
you
will
see
that
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
going
to
be
applying
its
staple
article
of
commerce
rationale
whether
or
not
there
was
a
substantial
amount
of
non
infringing
use
of
this
machine.
and
at
page
116,
i
believe
it
is,
of
petitioners'
appendix,
he
said,
whatever
the
percentage
of
legal
versus
nonlegal
recording
may
be,
he
would
still
apply
his
standard.
so
while
calling
this
betamax
a
staple
article
may
or
may
not
be
a
finding
of
fact,
it
just
doesn't
go
far
enough.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
think
whether
something
is
a
"staple",
a
word
that's
not
defined
anywhere
in
the
law
that
i'm
aware
of,
must
be
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
characterize
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
because
everything
on
television
is
protected
in
the
first...
not
everything,
excuse
me.
virtually
everything
that's
on
television
is
protected
in
the
first
instance
from
copying,
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
showing
that
the
amount
of
that
material
that
might
be
legally
copied,
if
any,
was
a
substantial
enough
amount
to
make
this
a
staple
article
of
commerce
to
the
level
or
sufficient
to
say
that
the
patent
doctrine,
for
example,
would
apply.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
the
district
court
made
no
finding
on
that
issue.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
correct.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
your
honor,
because
there's
a
doctrine
under
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
that
says,
if
the
evidence
below
only
permits
one
conclusion
of
fact
then
there
is
no
need
to
remand.
that
of
course
was
articulated
by
this
court
last
term
in
the
pullman
versus
swint
case.
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
here,
had
the
burden
of
coming
forward
and
showing,
if
they
were
going
to
rely
on
the
staple
article
doctrine,
that
there
was
a
substantial
amount
of
non
infringing
material.
the
reason
the
district
court
did
not
make
that
finding
was
because
it
couldn't
make
that
finding
on
the
evidence,
and
therefore
there
was
no
need
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
return
the
case
after
it
decided
it.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
if
your
hypothetical
existed,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
the
analogy
would
be
that
the
seller
of
a
photocopying
machine
which
is
advertised
and
manufactured
for
the
purpose
of
having
people
make
copies
of
copyrighted
works
in
their
home
or
anywhere
else
would
be
liable.
but
those
aren't
the
facts
concerning
xerox.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
well,
by
now
xerox's
entire
advertising
and
marketing
campaign
over
the
years
that
it's
been
in
the
market
has
been
such
that
it
has
made
the
public
aware
of
that,
your
honor,
yes.
but
xerox
has
never
from
the
beginning
advertised
or
promoted
or
marketed
its
equipment
for
the
purpose
of
recording
or
making
copies
of
copyrighted
material.
that's
the
way
betamax
started
out.
betamax
has
done
a
very
good
job
of
it.
everybody
in
this
country
i
think,
most
literate
people
anyway,
probably
know
that.
and
so
the
mere
fact
that
sony
has
now
changed
its
advertisements,
it's
too
late.
they
have
infected
this
country
with
the
knowledge
that
causes
copyright
infringement,
and
i
think
at
that
point
it
really
doesn't
matter
any
more
exactly
what
the
ads
say.
i
might
say
that
under
the
standard
in
the
trademark
area,
articulated
by
this
court
in
the
inwood
case
last
term,
it
was
suggested
by
the
court
that
if
a
product
is
sold
merely
with
the
implication
that
it
can
be
used
for
copyright...
for
infringing
purposes,
trademark
infringing
purposes
in
that
case,
that's
sufficient
for
contributory
infringement,
at
least
in
the
trademark
infringement
area.
i
think
it's
also
important
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
an
end
result
after
all
these
machines
are
used
that
is
no
different
than
the
end
result
of
commercial
piracy.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
to
the
court
that
an
individual
betamax
owner
in
his
home
is
the
same
as
a
commercial
pirate.
but
we're
not
talking
in
this
case
about
a
single
individual
betamax
owner.
we're
talking
about
millions
of
betamax
owners.
and
when
they
get
done
making
their
copies,
they
end
up
with
millions
of
copies
of
respondents'
copyrighted
works.
it
just
makes
no
difference
that
the
millions
of
copies
end
up
in
their
hands
because
they
make
them
individually,
without
seeing
or
hearing
each
other,
rather
than
buying
them
from
a
film
pirate.
the
end
result
is
exactly
the
same.
and
the
1976
copyright
statute
under
which
we're
now
operating
was
specifically
designed
to
protect
copyright
owners
from
mass
copying
activities
in
all
contexts.
i
think
we've
quoted
for
the
court
a
provision
from
the
legislative
history
that
i
will
take
a
chance
at
quoting
now
because
i
think
it's
important.
congress
said
at
least
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
that
isolated
instances
of
minor
infringements,
when
multiplied
many
times,
become
in
the
aggregate
a
major
inroad
on
copyright
that
must
be
prevented.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
has
several
effects,
both
under
existing
markets
and
as
yet
untapped
but
emerging
markets.
first,
many
of
the
motion
pictures
that
are
shown
on
television
are
also
available
for
sale
or
rental
on
video
cassettes
or
video
discs
which
are
licensed
by
the
copyright
owners.
they're
available
for
rental,
which
means
generally
a
person
would
just
want
to
see
it
once
and
then
return
it.
the
time
shift
recording,
which
i
think
is
what
you're
referring
to,
would
serve
exactly
the
same
purpose.
abc,
referred
to
by
mr.
dunlavey,
is
now
exploring
the
use
of
technology
that
would
permit
the
copyright
owner
to
license
home
owners
the
right
to
record
copyrighted
works
off
the
air
for
a
fee,
which
of
course
is
a
right
within
the
exclusive
control
of
the
copyright
owner.
that's
a
market
that
doesn't
exist
yet,
but
with
sony's
cooperation
modifying
its
circuitry
so
that
you
couldn't
record
off
a
scrambled
signal,
for
example,
off
the
air
without
permission,
that's
a
market
that
could
be
available
to
copyright
owners.
so
the
time
shifting
type
of
recording
that
exists
now
would
destroy
that
kind
of
market,
because
people
don't
have
to
pay
for
it
now;
they
certainly
aren't
going
to
want
to
pay
for
it
in
the
future.
there's
an
additional
area,
your
honor,
that
we
haven't
really
touched
on
in
our
briefs.
when
a
television
series
or
a
motion
picture
goes
off
network
and
goes
to
the
local
stations
around
the
country
in
the
syndication
market,
it's
typically
licensed
for
six
runs.
i
don't
think
there
could
be
much
dispute
that
a
syndicated
station
will
not
want
to
take
six
runs
in
a
license
if
it
knows
that
people
have
already
been
seeing
this
product
many
times
before
it
reaches
the
local
station.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
yes,
the
entire
series
would
be
shown
six
times,
that's
what
it
means.
and
motion
pictures
are
generally
offered
for
syndication
licenses
anywhere
from
three
to
eight
runs
per
picture.
i
think
it's
also
very
important
to
emphasize
here
what
the
economics
are
of
what's
going
on.
just
as
in
commercial
piracy,
here
somebody
else
is
being
paid
for
unauthorized
copies
of
copyright
owners'
works.
betamax
purchasers
are
paying
enormous
sums
to
the
petitioners
for
the
right
to
make
their
off
the
air
recordings.
they're
not
getting
these
copies
for
free.
anybody
that
thinks
that
is
just
laboring
under
a
misconception.
they're
paying
petitioners
and
they're
paying
them
very
handsomely.
yet
petitioners
are
not
sharing
any
of
their
revenues
with
the
copyright
owners
whose
product,
whose
television
motion
pictures,
make
betamax
such
an
attractive
consumer
device.
the
economic
reality
is
certainly
that
if
these
machines
couldn't
be
used
to
record
motion
pictures
and
other
type
of
copyrighted
entertainment
programming
owned
by
the
respondents
and
the
amici
who
have
filed
briefs
here,
there
would
be
a
very
substantially
reduced
demand
for
that
product.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
suppose
that's
true,
justice
rehnquist.
but
you
know,
sony
had
an
opportunity
here
to
work
with
the
copyright
owners
to
devise
a
jamming
system
that
would
prevent
copying
only
of
the
works
owned
by
the
respondents
and
others
who
might
object.
they
abhorred
that
possibility.
they've
run
from
it.
now,
to
me
that
proves
that
they
think
that
our
product
is
the
most
important
product
to
people
that
buy
betamax
in
terms
of
what
they
want
to
record.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
think
that's
the
presumption
of
the
copyright
law,
your
honor.
once
a
product
is
protected
by
copyright,
under
the
lower
court
cases...
and
this
court
has
never
reached
that
issue...
there
is
a
presumption
that
unauthorized
use
is
prohibited.
and
i
think
it
may
be
appropriate
at
this
point
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
what's
copyrighted
and
what's
protected
on
the
air
and
what
is
not.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct.
under
the
current
copyright
act,
a
work
which
is
fixed
in
a
tangible
form
becomes
immediately
protected
by
copyright
at
the
moment
of
its
creation.
that's
unlike
the
old
scheme
that
we
operated
under
up
until
1976,
where
you
had
to
have
publication
with
notice.
that's
no
longer
required.
as
soon
as
there's
creation
of
the
copyrighted
work,
it's
protected
by
copyright.
that
copyright
protection
subsists
even
if
there's
never
even
registration,
for
example.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
well,
the...
your
honor,
i
think
you...
mr.
justice,
chief
justice,
you're
talking
about,
when
you
say
"applied
for",
you're
talking
about
registering
the
copyrighted
work
with
the
copyright
office.
registration
only
affects
certain
remedies
that
a
copyright
owner
may
have.
it
does
not
affect
the
substance
or
the
existence
of
the
copyright.
for
example,
you
must
register
the
work
before
you
can
bring
suit
on
it.
but
your
inability
to
bring
suit
doesn't
mean
that
you
lose
your
copyright
and
it
doesn't
mean
you
lose
your
ability
to
object,
to
tell
somebody,
for
example,
that
you
don't
want
them
copying
your
product.
so
i
think
petitioner's
counsel
is
laboring
under
a
bit
of
a
misconception
when
he
says
that
because
some
local
stations
with
some
of
their
material
erase
the
only
copies
that
they
keep
of
their
local
television
programming
and
therefore
don't
register
it...
that
doesn't
mean
there's
no
copyright
protection.
that
copyright
protection
continues.
and
in
answer
to
your...
in
further
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
would
be
incumbent
on
sony,
who
is
selling
a
machine
that's
used
primarily,
by
their
own
admission,
to
record
television
programming,
and
by
their
own
admission
the
majority
of
which
would
be
copyrighted
material,
to
let
the
public
who's
going
to
buy
this
machine
know
what
can
be
copied.
that
shouldn't
be
the
burden
of
the
copyright
owner;
it
should
be
the
burden
on
the
parties
creating
this
problem.
i
want
to
emphasize
something
else.
we've
been
talk...
i've
heard
some
discussion
earlier
about
the
findings
below
and
what
did
the
ninth
circuit
do
with
them.
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion...
and
i
feel
very
comfortable
in
telling
the
court
this...
every
thing
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
is
based
either
on
a
specific
finding
of
the
lower
court,
even
though
maybe
not
referenced
as
such
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
or
on
admissions
by
the
petitioners.
i
have
seen
no
reversal
or
upsetting
of
a
specific
finding
of
fact
in
the
trial
court
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
at
all
relevant
to
this
proceeding
or
which
exists
at
all.
now,
probably--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--as
long
as
i
don't
call
staple
article
a
finding
of
fact,
although
as
i
said,
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
that
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't,
because
you
have
to
have
the
further
finding.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
it
did
disagree
with
the
analysis.
but
actually,
mr.
justice
white,
what
it
said
was
the
staple
article
doctrine
doesn't
remotely
raise
copyright
problems.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
go
on
in
very
great
detail
to
tell
us
what
it
meant
by
that,
but
it
might
have
meant
that
there
was
no
finding
of
substantial
non
infringing
use
and
therefore
it
really
didn't
matter
whether
you
call
it
a
staple
article
or
not.
with
respect
to
the
fair
use
question,
this
issue
has
to
be
examined
in
the
context
of
the
overall
statutory
scheme.
as
we've
discussed
in
our
briefs...
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
court
through
chapter
and
verse
now...
congress
gave
greater
protection
to
motion
pictures
than
to
any
other
works.
it
did
not
explicitly
state
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
statute
itself
that
home
recording
of
motion
pictures
was
permitted.
given
this
special
attention
to
motion
pictures
and
the
absence
of
any
statement
that
home
recording
is
permitted,
we
submit
that
any
suggestion
that
congress
nevertheless
intended
a
home
video
recording
fair
use
exemption
is
just
impossible
to
accept.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
the
fair
use
issue,
mr.
justice
stevens?
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
think
that
the
analysis
would
be
different
because
we're
faced
with
some
rather
loose
language
that
occurred
in
1971
with
respect
to
audio
tape
recordings.
i
don't
think
that
issue
need
be
reached
in
this
court,
but
i
can
make
an
argument,
and
i
think
probably
very
persuasively,
that
audio
tape
recording
is
an
infringement
under
the
new
act.
but
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't,
it's
our
position
that
makes
no
difference
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
the
issue--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--yes,
and
the
music
interests
have
very
forcefully
argued
that
that
should
be
so.
they
do
have
to
contend
with
that
language
in
1971,
which
we
don't
believe
we
have
to
contend
with
in
the
video
area.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
suppose
if
i
wanted
to
get
philosophical
with
you,
mr.
justice--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--right.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
it
probably
wouldn't.
but
in
that
statute
it
also
wouldn't
be
determined
to
be
noncommercial
educational
purposes,
which
is
the
counterbalance
to
the
commercial.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
but
i
don't
think
in
general
you'd
call
it
commercial,
mr.
justice.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
think
the
findings
establish
that
there
will
be
an
adverse
effect.
the
findings
are
the
following,
justice
stevens:
one,
the
district
court
repeatedly
found
that
betamax
recordings
will
compete
with
licensed
versions
of
respondents'
works
in
many
markets,
particularly
the
emerging
market
for
the
sale
and
rental
of
cassettes
and
disks.
i
don't
think
we
gave
complete
transcript
references
in
our
brief.
they're
found
at
pages
78,
107,
112,
and
116.
now,
obviously
the
respondents
are
not
going
to
always
prevail
in
that
competition,
and
i
think
that
finding
itself
is
sufficient
to
show
an
adverse
effect.
the
district
court
also
expressly
found
that
betamax
copies
serve
the
same
function
as
the
original,
and
we
have
a
doctrine
of
law
in
the
fair
use
cases
that
when
a
copy
and
the
original
serve
the
same
function
then
there
is
a
detrimental,
a
potential
detrimental
effect
established
for
fair
use
purposes.
that's
not
just
a
mechanical
sort
of
made
up
rule.
it's
based
on
common
sense.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
what
happened
was
the
district
court
reversed
the
burden
of
proof,
which
is
quite
clearly
under
established
case
law
on
the
petitioners,
put
it
on
the
respondents
and
said
the
respondents
didn't
meet
that
burden.
but
if
he
had
looked
at
what
the
petitioners'
proof
was,
because
he
said
it's
so
speculative
in
his
mind
as
to
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
future,
he
couldn't
have
found
the
petitioners
carried
their
burden,
either.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
there
are
certain
guidelines,
your
honor,
that
mr.
dunlavey
alluded
to,
which
are
a
subject
of
agreement
between
copyright
owners
and
educators,
which
give
the
copyright
owners
the
kind
of
control
they're
entitled
to
under
the
copyright
act,
that
might
or
might
not
permit
that
activity.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
familiar
enough
with
those
guidelines.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
different
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
for
a
salutary
purpose
of
furthering
education,
science,
research.
medical
research
was
the
example
in
williams
and
wilkins.
but
those
are
far
different
than
this
case--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--where
all
we
have
is
copying
for
home
entertainment.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
fair
use.
[laughter]
when's
the
reunion?
with
respect
to
the
staple
article
of
commerce--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--mr.
chief
justice,
as
i
said,
many--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--many
motion
pictures
that
are
on
television
are
available
for
rental
in
cassette
form.
the
injury
is
you
wouldn't
be...
respondents
wouldn't
be--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--not
all.
respondents
wouldn't
be
able
to
rent
those
pictures.
as
i
also
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
there
appears
to
be
an
emerging
market,
which
the
registrar
of
copyrights
said
may
be
even
more
important
than
existing
markets
when
you
examine
this
aspect
of
the
fair
use
defense,
and
that
is
the
opportunity
of
the
copyright
owner
to
license
the
home
owner
who's
out
for
dinner
the
right
to
copy
the
respondent's
work
off
the
air,
by
using
the
proper
technology
for
a
fee.
and
what's
being
interfered
with
here
is
the
opportunity
to
ever
get
to
that
point
because
now
people
are
doing
it
for
no
fee.
i'm
running
out
of
time.
there
are
a
couple
of
things
i
would
like
to
mention
very
quickly.
with
respect
to
this
argument
that
there
is
consent
by
certain
people
to
record
off
the
air,
mr.
justice
white
alluded
to
the
fact
that
a
motion
picture
doesn't
just
spring
out
of
the
air.
it's
based
on
a
lot
of
underlying
material:
the
music,
which
is
copyrighted;
written
work,
such
as
books
and
plays,
which
are
copyrighted.
and
unless
you...
and
they're
all
separately
copyrighted.
and
unless
the
petitioner
or
the
copier
has
the
permission
of
the
owners
of
all
of
the
works
that
are
embodied
in
that
motion
picture,
there
is
no
valid
consent
to
the
recording
of
that
material.
but
even
if
there
were
consent
to
some
material,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
emphasize,
as
the
ninth
circuit
did,
that
just
because
some
copyright
owners
don't
choose
to
enforce
their
rights
doesn't
mean
that
other
copyright
owners
who
choose
to
enforce
theirs
cannot
do
so.
and
when
you
look
at
how
much
is
supposedly
consented
to,
you
find
out
it's
almost
nothing
compared
to
what
isn't.
petitioners'
own
survey
showed
that
less
than
nine
percent
of
all
recordings
consist
of
sports,
religious
and
educational
programming,
and
that's
all
sports,
religious
and
educational
programming,
not
just
the
programming
owned
by
the
few
witnesses
that
were
brought
to
the
trial
by
the
petitioners.
in
contrast,
over
80
percent
of
all
the
recordings
are
of
entertainment
programming,
which
was
defined
in
petitioners'
own
survey
to
mean
motion
pictures,
television
series
and
game
shows.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
they
are
copyrighted,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
you
can't
copy
those
programs,
based
on
the
evidence
that
the
petitioners
brought
to
the
trial.
because
if
you
watched
the
redskins
game
on
saturday
and
you
heard
the
little
announcement,
it
said
that
there
could
be
no
use
made
of
that
broadcast
without
the
permission
of
the
washington
redskins
and
the
national
football
league.
only
the
national
football
league's
office
of
the
commissioner
gave
any
testimony
on
this
issue,
and
the
records
show
that
they
didn't
discuss
this
issue
with
any
of
the
individual
teams,
for
example
the
washington
redskins.
so
there's
not
enough
consent
to
allow
even
that
kind
of
copying
in
this
record.
i
think
we
should
leave
the
staple
article
of
commerce
and
the
contributory
infringement
issue
with
this
thought:
i
think
that
petitioners
conceded
in
their
brief,
and
i
believe
it
very
clearly
to
be
the
law,
that
if
there's
knowing
contribution
to
the
direct
infringement
involved
here,
you
don't
ever
have
to
reach
the
staple
article
of
commerce
argument.
that
was
an
approach
that
was
approved
by
this
court
in
the
kalem
brothers
case.
it's
exactly
the
approach
that
is
followed
in
section
271
of
the
patent
statute,
where
very
specifically
the
patent
statute
says
that
when
a
defendant
causes,
furthers,
or
urges
the
use
of
his
product,
which
might
otherwise
be
a
staple,
in
an
infringing
way
then
he
is
liable
for
patent
infringement
under
section
271(b)
even
if
you
call
that
product
a
staple
article.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
under
the
test
laid
down
in
the
inwood
case
sony
would
be
selling
this
product
with
knowledge
or
reason
to
know
that
it
would
be
used
to
record
copyrighted
works
at
least
sometimes
and
would
therefore
be--
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
--if
you
just
thought
that
there
were
a
few
unscrupulous
people
out
there
that
couldn't
resist
the
temptation,
no,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
enough,
justice
white.
but
if
you
knew
as
a
matter
of
belief
and
encouragement
and
instruction
in
your
instruction
manuals
that
that
would
happen,
i
think
it
would
be
enough.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
i
don't
label
home
owners
in
this
context
as
unscrupulous.
i
think
they've
been
duped
by
the
petitioners
into
believing
that
what
they're
doing
is
legal.
mr.
stephen
a.
kroft
and
they
haven't
paid
the
copyright
owner,
mr.
justice
white.
thank
you.
