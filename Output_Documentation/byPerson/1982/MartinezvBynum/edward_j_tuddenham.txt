mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
in
many
respects
a
companion
case
to
last
term's
decision
in
plyler
versus
doe.
it
is
another
attempt
by
the
state
of
texas
to
exclude
unwanted
mexican
children
from
the
schools
of
texas,
and
to
deter
them
from
migrating
to
the
state.
what
the
state
does
here
is
far
less
defensible
than
what
it
did
in
plyler
versus
doe.
the
children
that
the
state
is
depriving
of
an
education
in
this
case
are,
in
fact,
united
states
citizens.
citizens
whose
parents
are
mexican
nationals.
but
these
citizen
children
have
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
establish
their
homes
in
the
united
states.
and
the
mechanism
used
by
the
state
to
exclude
these
children
from
school
is
to
define
them
as
non-residents.
the
statute
at
issue
here
states
that
a
child
who
lives
apart
from
his
parents
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
an
education
is
a
non-resident
if
he
is
moved
apart
from
his
parents
in
order
to
obtain
an
education.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
it
is
set
out...
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
on
page
2
of
the
brief.
it's
subsection
(d),
the
section
challenged
here.
but
of
course,
it's
precisely
children
like
roberto
morales
and
other
children
whose
parents
are
mexican
nationals
who
must
move
apart
from
their
parents
in
order
to
obtain
the
education
they
need
if
they
are
to
participate
in
american
society
and
exercise
their
birthright,
their
american
citizenship.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
well,
there
are
several
answers
to
that.
if
the
child
is
simply
commuting
from
one
district
to
another
and,
in
fact,
returns
at
night
to
live
with
its
parents,
then--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--if
the
child,
in
fact,
moves
and
establishes
a
residence
with
a
sister
in
another
school
district
and
residence
is
the
criteria
for
admission
to
school,
then
i
should
think
that
that
child
would
have
the
right
to
attend
school.
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
statute
does
more
than
that.
the
problem
with
the
example
you're
giving...
and
i
think
it
is
the
essential
problem
of
the
case...
is
this
notion
that
if
a
child
has
a
choice
between
two
districts,
there's
something
somehow
wrong
with
him
choosing
one
district
over
another.
well,
setting
that
problem
aside
for
the
moment,
that's
not
what
this
statute
prohibits.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
the
state
has
an
interest
in
protecting
its
schools
from
excessive
problems
of
migration,
but
it
can't
do
that
by
prohibiting
migration.
and
i
think
that
the
problem
that
you
pose
is
really
more
in
the
minds
of
the
school
administrators
than
the
evidence
in
this
case
would
demonstrate.
in
fact,
several
states
such
as
new
york,
pennsylvania,
new
jersey
and
connecticut,
and
i
also
believe
colorado,
have
statutes
that
would
allow
parents
to
do
just
what
you
have
said
in
your
example
here.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
well,
i
would
argue
that
if
the
child
has
a
right
to
travel
and
a
right
to
establish
his
home
in
another
district,
then
he
can.
but--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--to
establish
a
new
home,
yes.
but,
your
honor,
understand
that
in
this
case,
texas
doesn't
prohibit
what
you're
saying.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
perhaps,
again,
where
there
is
a
choice
between
school
districts,
there
might
be
some
grounds
for
limitation,
although
i
think
if
there
are
going
to
be
limitations
on
a
child's
constitutional
rights
as
opposed
to
an
adult's,
it
must
have
something
intrinsic
to
do
with
the
child,
some
disability
of
the
child.
but
the
state
of
texas
has
made
clear
that
it
does
not
care
whether
children
move
from
one
district
to
another
to
live
with
a
sister,
so
long
as
they
can
come
up
with
some
other
reason
for
doing
it.
and--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--the
only
test
for
school
residency
in
texas
is
de
facto
residence.
there
is
no
requirement
of
prior
residence,
there's
no
requirement
of
intent
to
remain.
all
you
have
to
do
is
be
present
in
the
district,
and
that
goes--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--well,
the
statute
itself
simply
refers
to
residence,
but
last
year
in
plyler
versus
doe
the
state
argued
that...
i
believe
the
example
was
someone
coming
from
virginia
for
six
months
could
bring
their
child
and
stay
for
six
months
with
the
fixed
intention
to
return
to
virginia,
and
during
that
six
months
they
would
be--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--there
is
also
evidence
in
the
record,
your
honor,
in
the
school
applications
that
were
submitted
as
plaintiff's
exhibit
8.
there
are
a
number
of
examples
there.
the
one
that
comes
to
my
mind
right
now
is
one
of
a
mother
who
sent
her
child
to
live
with
a
grandmother
in
south
texas
for
a
few
months.
there
was
some
problem;
the
mother
just
couldn't
take
care
of
the
child
at
that
moment,
but
was
going
to
come
and
take
the
child
back
to
houston
in
december
after
one
semester.
that
child
was
admitted
as
a
resident.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
what
it
prohibits
is...
the
state
says
that
a
child
can
establish
residence
apart
from
its
parent
or
guardian
for
any
reason
it
wants
to.
so
they
have
no
problem
with
the
capacity
of
the
child
to
establish
residence
apart
from
its
parent.
it
simply
then
takes
one
class
of
those
children
and
says
you
cannot
establish
residence
apart
from
your
parents
because
you've
come
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
an
education.
and
to
go
back
to
your
question,
justice
rehnquist,
the
fact
that
the
state
may
have
a
legitimate
concern
about
children
district-hopping,
i
believe
is
the
way
the
respondents
referred
to
it,
this
statute
doesn't
stop
that.
if
a
parent
has
enough
money
to
obtain
a
guardianship,
or
if
he
can
concoct
a
reason
other
than
the
need
for
an
education,
then
the
child
can
transfer.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
well,
the
district
court
found
that
any
reason
would
suffice;
any
reason
other
than
the
desire
to
obtain
an
education.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
well,
there
is
inquiry
into
what
is
your
purpose
for
being
here.
and
if
the
purpose...
very
often,
in
moving
from
one
district
to
another,
from
one
state
to
another,
that
purpose
may
represent
educational
needs
as
desperate
as
roberto
morales'.
what
has
happened
here
is
roberto
morales
has
no
other
school
that
he
can
attend.
he
is
not
being
precluded
from
choosing
one
district
over
another.
he--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--well,
in
the
district
court
we
amended
our
complaint
to
drop
the
claim
that
the
statute
is
being
discriminatorily
applied.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
that
is
correct.
but
on
its
face,--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--i
believe
his
finding
was
that
if
you
had
any
other
reason
for
getting
in,
they
would
let
you
in.
there
was
no
statistical
evidence
to
show
that--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--that
was
not
presented
to
him.
that
issue
did
not
come
up.
there
was
no
analysis
done
of
the
school
applications
to
show
that
children
coming
from
mexico
were
excluded
more
frequently
than
children
coming
from
other
states
or--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--absolutely,
it
does.
but
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
the
purpose
for
this
statute
was
to
deter
migration.
it
was
not
to
control
inter-district
transfers.
it
was
to
deter
migration
from
mexico,
to
keep
children
whose
parents
cannot
enter
the
country
from
coming
here
because
they're
citizens
and
obtaining
an
education.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
it
is
a
facial
challenge,
but
on
its
face--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--boarding
home
situation?
the
state
could
deal
with
that
if
that
is
a
problem.
the
state
could
deal
with
that
in
any
number
of
less
restrictive
ways.
many
states,
for
instance,
make
the
reasonable
assumption
that
who
is
providing
the
care
and
clothing
for
the
child
is...
in
other
words,
who's
supporting
the
child...
is
a
legitimate
criteria
to
look
at
to
determine
the
child's
residence.
and
that
would
be
a
far
less
broad
definition,
and
it
would
take
care
of
the
boarding
home
problem
because,
of
course,
the
boarding
home
would
be
a
commercial
operation
receiving
pay
from
the
parents.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
the
record
states
that
he
intended
to
stay
until
he
completed
his
high
school
education.
when
we
submitted
that
evidence,
roberto
morales
was
nine
years
old
and
didn't
really
know
what
he
wanted
to
do.
last
week
when
i
talked
to
him
he
said
he
wanted
to
grow
up
and
be
a
doctor
and
live
in
mcallen.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
i
think
this
has
to
be
looked
at...
it's
a
family
situation.
obviously,
when
a
child
is
nine,
roberto
morales
may
or
may
not
have
known
what
was
in
his
best
interest.
his
parents,
i
think,
recognized
that
since
he
was
a
united
states
citizen
and
he
was
going
to
live
in
the
united
states
as
an
adult,
he
had
to
learn
how
to
speak
english.
and
he
couldn't
wait
until
he
was
18
and
could
make
up
his
mind
to
move
to
the
united
states
and
learn
english
then,
because
by
then
it
would
be
too
late.
these
people
are
indigent
and
they
cannot
simply
move
at
age
18
and
start
adult
education
classes.
so
his
parents
were
the
ones,
i
imagine,
when
he
was
nine
who,
as
a
family,
made
the
sacrifice
to
send
their
child
away
so
that
his
life
would
not
be
forever
stigmatized
by
the
fact
that
he
did
not
learn
what
it
was
to
be
an
american
citizen.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
that
is
not
in
the
record,
although
the
way
this
comes
up
is
the
parents
are
either
here
temporarily...
mexican
parents
are
either
in
texas
temporarily
on
visas
or
they're
here
illegally.
but
when
the
child
is
born
in
the
united
states,
he
then
becomes
a
u.s.
citizen.
and
that
brings
up
an
important
comparison
between
this
case
and
plyler,
because
i
think
what's
going
on
here,
what
was
in
the
minds...
or
what
the
legislative
history
indicates...
is
that
the
reason
these
children
are
being
excluded
from
school
is
the
notion
that
somehow,
they
really
aren't
u.s.
citizens.
that
they
were
born
here
because
their
parents
managed
to
get
across
the
river,
and
for
that
reason,
they
can
be
deprived
of
the
education
that
is
made
available
to
all
other
citizens
of
texas.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
well,
if
he
were
entering,
say,
on
a
visa,
say,
if
the
federal
government
had
granted
him
a
permanent
residence
visa--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--well,
if
he
came
in
legally,
under
the
federal
immigration
laws
i
should
think
that
there
would
be
a
supremacy
problem
for
the
state
then--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--if
he
had
entered
legally
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
now,
there
would
be
the
additional
argument
that
if
the
federal
government,
in
its
exercise
of
its
powers
of
immigration,
had
decided
that
it
was
all
right
for
this
child
to
enter
the
country,
then
the
state
could
not
burden
that
right
by
then
saying
well,
you
can
come
into
the
country,
but
if
you've
gotten
permission
to
come
in
to
go
to
school
we're
not
going
to
let
you
in
the
school.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
only
that
his
right
is
not
a
supremacy
right
of
immigration;
it's
that
he
is
a
citizen.
he
has
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
enter
this
country
and
live
here.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
well,
perhaps
if
he
is
entering
illegally
for
the
purpose
of
attending
school,
the
state
could
draw
a
narrower
statute
to
exclude
those
children.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
well,
there
is
a
footnote
in
justice
powell's
concurrence
with
respect
to
if
the
child
is
entering
for
the
purpose
of
attending
school,
then
you
could
make
a
pretty
good
logical
argument
that
excluding
him
would
be
consistent
with
the
federal
policy
of
deterring
immigration.
that
is,
if
he's
coming
by
himself
because
they're
the
only
children
being
affected
by
this
statute.
but
his
citizenship
is
what
gives
him
the
right
to
come
into
the
country,
and
that
right...
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
that
right
cannot
be
conditioned
because
the
state
doesn't
approve
of
his
reason
for
coming
here.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
it
is
our
argument
that
this
case
should
be
reversed
based
on
the
same
equal
protection
analysis
utilized
in
doe
v.
plyler.
but
here,
this
court
should
apply
strict
scrutiny
because
it
is
his
fundamental
right
to
travel
that
is
being
burdened,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
he
is
being
deprived
of
an
education.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
obviously,
children's
rights,
to
a
certain
extent,
are
not
co-extensive
with
an
adult's
rights.
but
what
i
would
submit
here
is
that
there
is
no
reason
shown
in
this
record
for
limiting
roberto
morales'
right
to
travel.
the
state
of
texas
has
already
decided
under
its
probate
code
that
there
is
a
responsible
adult
taking
care
of
him.
his
sister
is
perfectly
okay
with
the
state
of
texas.
if
he
is
moving
from
louisiana
or
from
peru,
if
he
comes
and
lives
with
his
sister,
the
state
of
texas
thinks
that's
just
fine,
as
long
as
he
isn't
coming
for
the
purpose
of
attending
school.
so
there's
nothing
intrinsic
about
the
fact
that
he
is
a
child
that
argues
that
his
right
to
travel
should
be--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
in
fact,
that's
precisely
what
the
state
of
texas
suggests.
they
suggest
that
there
is
no
deprivation
of
education
here
because
roberto
morales
can
go
back
to
texas.
and
they
recognize
that
if
he
does
not
have
an
education,
he
can't
just
sit
in
mcallen
on
the
streets
all
day,
although
he
did
that
for
one
year.
for
one
year
he
stayed
in
mcallen
waiting
to
become
eligible
for
school.
even
though
with
the
strictest
one-year
residency
requirements
which
were
struck
down
in
shapiro
and
dunn
and
in
maricopa
county,
he
would
have
qualified
as
a
resident
after
waiting
that
year.
but
under
this
statute,
he
is
still
called
a
non-resident
even
after
five
and
a
half
years
of
continual
residence.
he
is
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
any
other
resident
in
texas,
any
other
child
living
with
a
custodian,
and
the
sole
reason
that
he's...
his
motive.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
assuring
that
the
child
lives
with
a
responsible
adult.
absolutely.
but
the
state
of
texas
has
determined
that
roberto
morales'
sister
is
a
sufficiently
responsible
adult
under
the
state
laws.
now,
under--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--it
would
depend
on
their
reason
for
requiring
that.
if
the
reason
for
requiring
a
guardian--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
absolutely
a
state
has
interest
in
doing
that,
but
if
the
state
law
will
allow
a
custodian
to
do
all
of
those
things
as
it
does
in
texas,
then
the
guardian
would
not
be
needed
for
those
purposes.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
no,
there
were
no
admission
cards
at
the
time
that
this
child
was--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
the
only
records
that
were
kept
were
kept
by
the
order
of
the
district
court
and
that
was
after
roberto
morales--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
oh,
the
child
is
in
school
now,
they
have
his
sister,
oralia
martinez's
name.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
as
custodian.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
i
think
the
way
it's
referred
to
in
the
statute
is
person
having
lawful
control.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
so
far
as
the
school
is
concerned
she
is
not
a
disinterested
passerby.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
state
schools
accept
children
who
live
with
relatives,
or
friends
even.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
when
a
child
applies
to
school...
it's
not
in
the
record,
but
i
imagine
that
they
would
get
the
name
of
the
parent,
or
whoever
the
child
is
living
with,
and...
but
what
i
would
show
the
court
is
that
it
is
clear
under
the
statute
and
through
the
applications
kept
in
the...
as
plaintiff's
exhibit
a...
that
the
school
districts
do
admit
children
if
they
are
living
with
non-guardians;
with
relatives
or
friends.
and
whatever
the
paperwork
the
school
does
to
assure
that
they
have
the
names
of
those
people
is
done.
the
district
court
found,
as
a
finding
of
fact,
that
the
sister
was
entitled
to
give
medical
permission
and
other
kinds
of
permission
for
the
child.
i
know
the
school
has
her
name
now.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
that
is
correct.
he
is--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--it's
an
injunction
pending
appeal.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
he
was
out
of
school
for
a
year
and
then
the
injunction
came
and
he
was
admitted.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
in
the
first
place,
a
child's
right
to
travel
is
obviously
limited
by
the
parents'
wishes.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--well,
let
me
answer
that
first
by
saying
that
is
not
necessarily
the
case
before
the
court
here.
the
case
here
is
the
child
has
no
other
choice.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
okay.
but
leaving
that
aside,
if
the
parent
and
the
custodian,
whoever
it
is,
and
the
child
have
made
the
decision
that
this
is
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child,
to
give
up
living
with
his
parents,
give
up
the
day-to-day...
the
parents
giving
up
control
over
the
day-to-day
upbringing
of
their
child,
then
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
a
strong
argument
that
the
state
would
have
to
show
a
compelling
interest
to
interfere
with
that
choice.
however,
that's
not
the
case
here.
also,
i
would
point
out
that
this
statute
does
not
stop
that
in
any
way.
it
only
stops
that
for
indigents.
if
they
can
afford
a
guardianship,
they
can
do
it
now,
and
the
state
of
texas
doesn't
care.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
if
they
were
willing
to
become
guardians.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
even
if
they
were...
there
are
problems
with
the
guardianship
requirement
in
texas
in
that
it
could
mean
giving
up
permanent
custody
of
the
child,
such
that
it
would
require
a
second
proceeding
to
get
custody
of
your
child
back.
but
even
so,
the
expenses
involved
in
obtaining
a
guardianship
are
considerable
for
an
indigent.
they
may,
in
fact,
be
far
greater
than
the
cost
of
tuition.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
there
is
legal
aid,
your
honor,
but
as
the
people
are
rejected
under...
in
plaintiff's
exhibit
a,
the
30
examples
of
people
rejected,
most
of
those
people
did
not
make
it
to
our
doors
for
help.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
no,
it
applies
to
all.
i'm
simply
pointing
out
that
what
your...
the
concern
of
the
court
in
terms
of
people
choosing
districts
is
going
on
every
day
right
now
for
everyone
but
indigents.
and
i
don't
think
that
recognizing
the
right
of
indigents
to
move
to
obtain
an
education
is
going
to
substantially
affect
the
school
districts
in
this
country.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
they
could
also
pay
tuition.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
is
this
a
united
states
citizen
child?
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
yes,
they
do.
and
in
fact,
a
child
like--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--well,
the
only
reason
that
indigency
comes
up
is
that
those
parents
can
do
that
right
now
by
paying
the
minimal
amount
of
tuition--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--if
they
would
rather
stand
on
their
constitutional
right,
i
suppose
they
could.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
no,
they
wouldn't
be
eligible.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
that's
right.
the
constitutional
right
to
travel;
travel
in
the
sense
of
move
and
to
create
a
home,
to
live
and
abide
in
that
place.
establish
your
home
there.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
no,
i
don't
believe
so
because
still,
under
doe
v.
plyler,
this
child
is
being
absolutely
deprived
of
an
education
in
a
place
where
he
lives.
the
state
of
texas
can't
deport
him
from
mcallen.
they
might
exclude
him
from
school,
but
they
cannot
deport
him.
he's
a
citizen.
and
under
the
laws
of
texas
he
can
live
with
his
sister
and
continue
to
live
there
with
his
sister.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
it
would
depend
on
their
reason
for
doing
it.
if
the
sole
reason
for
doing
that
was
to
determine--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--if
that
were
the
reason
i
should
think
that
would
be
constitutional.
but
texas
doesn't
need
a
guardian
to
do
that.
texas
has
decided
that
the
custodian
is
sufficient
for
that
purpose.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
by
order
of
the
court.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
that's
the
statutory
language,
your
honor.
there
is
a
distinction
made
between
a
person
having
lawful
control,
which
is
a
sister,
a
custodian...
and
that's
accepted
by
the
state
of
texas...
and
a
person
having
lawful
control
by
order
of
court.
there
is
no
such
beast
under
the
laws
of
texas.
that's
a
guardian.
that's
just
the
statutory
language.
he
is
living
with
a
person
who
has
complete
legal
authority
over
him,
under
the
laws
of
texas.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
only
reason
he's
being
excluded
from
school--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--if
it
were...
that's
right,
that
would
be
a
different
case.
but
that's
not
this
case.
the
parents
here
want
him
to
be
able
to
obtain
an
education.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
absolutely.
the
court
order...
the
person
having
lawful
control
under
order
of
court
is
the
statutory
language
to
distinguish
that
from
a
person
who
simply
has
lawful
control.
if
you're
with
someone
under
lawful
control
by
order
of
court,
then
you
can
go
to
school
even
if
you
have
the
prohibited
motive.
if
you're
simply
living
with
a
sister,
whom
the
state
recognizes
has
lawful
control,
then
you
can't
go
to
school
if
you
have
the
prohibited
motive.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
thank
you.
just
to
quickly,
with
respect
to
the
facial
challenge
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
county
residence
statute,
this
complaint
in
this
case
was
patterned
on
maricopa
county
versus
memorial
hospital
which
was
also
a
facial
challenge
to
a
county
residence
statute
struck
down
on
international...
because
it
had
an
effect
on
interstate
travel.
in
the
final
minute,
i
would
just
like
to
reiterate
to
this
court
that--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--the
plaintiff
before
the
court
is
a
child
from
mexico;
he
is
the...
this
is
not
a
class
action.
it's--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--i
do
not
believe
so.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
the
facial
impact
of
this
statute
on
roberto
morales.
that's
how
it
was
litigated
in
the
district
court,
and
that's
how
it
was
defended.
[laughter]
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
well,
that
was
the
way
it
was
litigated
in
the
district
court--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
insofar
as
it
prevents
children
who
have
no
other
choice
and
who
need
an
education,
this
is
their
only
choice
for
an
education
in
the
united
states--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--the
record
shows
that
he
is
indigent,
and
a
guardian--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--his
parents
were
afraid
of
giving
up
permanent
custody
of
their
children.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
but
she
is
indigent
and
it
requires
a
bond
of
up
to
$1000
to
be
posted.
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
the
bond
was--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--excuse
me?
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
but
it
is
clear
that
this
statute
is
and
was
designed
to
create
an
expanding
class
of
american
citizens,
whose
parents
are
in
mexico
who
have
no
other
place
they
can
go
to
school,
but
who
have
a
right
even
now
as
citizens
to
live
in
the
united
states.
so,
does
he
live
here
and
not
go
to
school?
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
if
i
may
respond
to
that,
justice
white,
just
last
year
mr.
arnett,
in
plyler
versus
doe,
told
this
court
that
there
are
over
four
and
a
half
million
children
of
school
age
in
mexico
who
are
not
attending
school
because
of
inadequate
facilities
in
mexico.
so
there
is
no
guarantee
that
this
child
can
get
any
education--
mr.
edward
j.
tuddenham
--not
the
children
of
mexico,
but
this
child
as
a
united
states
citizen.
he
has
a
right
to
establish
a
home
in
the
united
states
today.
he
can't
be
deported
by
the
state
of
texas.
he
has
a
right
to
live
there.
thank
you.
