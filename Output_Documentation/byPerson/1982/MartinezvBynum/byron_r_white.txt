justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
say
the
state
does
prohibit
that
it
can't?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
be
your
argument
if
the
child
was
not
a
citizen.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
not
permanent.
suppose
they
just
let
him
in
to
get
an
education.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
fact
that
this
child
is
a
citizen
is
rather
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
irrelevant
to
your
argument.
i'm
sure
it's
not
irrelevant
generally.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
plyler?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
say
they
don't
want.
they
don't
want
to.
they'd
rather
use
their
money
for
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
represent
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
interesting,
though,
that
you
have
stipulated
in
this
case
that
none
of
these
children
live
with
his
or
her
parents
or
a
legal
guardian,
or
a
person
having
lawful
control
of
him
or
her,
on
the
order
of
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
none
of
them
has
a
parent,
legal
guardian
or
other
person
having
lawful
control
of
them
under
an
order
of
court,
living
within
the
school
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if...
not
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
parents.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
going
to
pay
the
taxes,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
family
from
new
mexico
doesn't
want
to
move
into
texas,
but
they
want
to
send
their
child
down
there,
and
they
say
what's
your
tuition,
and
you
tell
them
and
they
say,
we'll
pay
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
some
districts
permit
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
if
you
can
pay
a
tuition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
would
be
the
only
people
who
would
be
paying
a
tuition;
otherwise,
it's
free,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
commute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
you
lose
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
amount
of
the
tuition
in
the
record,
that
you
would
have
to
pay
if--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
what
is
the
tuition?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
rule
really
does
have
an
incidence
on
people
who
can't
pay
the
tuition.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
move
into
the
district
for
an
education
anytime
you
want
to
pay
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
this
district's
policy
is
to
accept
tuition.
this
statute
is
being
administered
in
this
district
on
the
basis
that
you
may
come
here
solely
for
an
education
if
you
can
pay
the
tuition.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
could
give
you
all
the
relief
you
wanted
by
just
saying
that
insofar
as
this
statute
impacts
on...
has
an
impact
on
your
client,
it's
unconstitutional.
and
you
would...
is
that
all
you
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
record--
--that
would
include
justice
stevens'
example.
yes,
and
i
don't
think
this
record
shows...
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
this
particular
child
could
not
have
had
a
guardian
appointed
for
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
can
go
to
school
in
mexico.
you
just
say
they
won't
get
the
education
they
think
they'll
get
in
the
united
states.
