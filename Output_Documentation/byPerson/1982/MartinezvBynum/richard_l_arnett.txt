mr.
richard
l.
arnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
first
we
probably
ought
to
straighten
out
the
history
of
this
provision.
it
was
codified
in
1977;
however,
this
is
a
rule
of
texas
law
that
dates
back
at
least
to
1905.
it's
a
rule
of
american
law
that
dates
back
at
least
to
1851
in
what
was
apparently
the
first
school
residence
case
in
the
nation.
it
was
introduced
into
jurisprudence
by
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
at
that
time.
in
1905,
the
texas
attorney
general's
opinion
expressly
relied
on
this
rule,
stating
that
the
child
was
not
entitled
to
go
to
school
in
a
little
town
called
rockdale
in
central
texas
if
the
main
purpose
of
the
child
being
there
was
to
obtain
an
education
in
that
district,
and
this
child
did
not
live
with
parents
or
guardians.
he
equated
the
main
purpose
of
being
there
for
an
education
with
an
ostensible
residence
as
opposed
to
substantial
residence.
just
to
show
the
dissimilarity
of
this
rule
of
law
with
the
rule
of
law
at
issue
in
plyler
versus
doe,
some
15
years
later
while
this
rule
was
still
in
effect
in
texas,
the
texas
attorney
general
ruled
that
they
also
had
to
admit
any
illegal
aliens
in
the
school.
it
didn't
matter...
and
you'll
find
that
in
the
record
of
the
plyler
case,
reference
to
that
1920
decision
in
the
1975
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
in
1973,
this
question
recurred...
the
question
in
this
instant
case...
recurred
several
times,
right
on
up
until
1973
where
the
attorney
general
reviewed
all
the
decision
up
to
date
and
reiterated
that
the
test
for
residence
in
texas
to
go
to
school
is
not
domicile,
it's
not
an
intent
to
remain
permanently,
it's
what
is
termed
a
bona
fide
residence,
and
a
bona
fide
residence
can
be
acquired
apart
from
a
parent
or
guardian
if
your
purpose
for
residing
in
that
district
and
being
present
in
that
district
is
not
for
the
primary
purpose
of
going
to
school.
and
justice
o'connor,
that
is
the
texas
test
of
residency
and
has
been
now
for
77
years
at
least.
for
school
purposes.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
by
administrative
interpretation.
these
were
advice
from
the
attorney
general
to
the
texas...
to
the
education,
to
the
state
agency,
as
to
what
children
were
required
to
be
admitted
by
the
various
local
school
districts.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
it's
not
simply
de
facto.
it
is
what
is
termed
a
bona
fide
residency,
and
you
see
that
occurring
throughout
the
opinions
of
this
court
as
well.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
not
if
your
primary
purpose
is
to
obtain
an
education.
but
if
your
primary
purpose
happens
to
be
that
you
need
to
be
there
for
some
other
reason,...
let's
say
health;
you
need
to
go
down
to
texas
for
treatment
for
six
months...
then
yes,
you
would
be
admitted
to
school.
and
it
has
been
that
way
in
texas,
as
i
say,
for
77
years.
this
has
been
advice
to
the
state
superintendent
of
education
at
that
time,
back
in
1905.
this
is
also
stated
by
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
the
deleon
case
which
also
preceded
this
codification.
and
that
deleon
case,
also,
in
that
case,
the
court
of
civil
appeals
for
corpus
christi
said
that
that
was
really
what
they
meant
to
say
in
gamboa
as
well,
which
gamboa
has
some
dicta
that
tends
to
go
the
other
way.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
all
right.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
yes,
your
honor,
because
when
their
parents
move
into
that
district
as
a
family
unit
on
another
situation
where
a
child
resides
with
the
guardian...
and
the
reason
we
have
a
guardianship
provision
is
some
children
need
to
have
guardians.
application
for
guardianship
in
texas
has
to
specify
the
necessity
for
a
guardian's
appointment,
so
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
the
statute
can
be
frustrated
in
the
method
contemplated
and
suggested
by
the
petitioner.
but
getting
back
to
your
question,
you
have
a
shapiro
type
of
case
there.
you
have
a
family
relocating
for
all
purposes.
now,
their
primary
purpose
may
be
to
change
school
districts,
but
on
the
other
hand,--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--okay.
but
at
the
same
time,
they
have
joined
the
polity
of
that
district,
for
100
percent
of
all
purposes.
they
can
vote
there,
they
are
going
to
live
there,
they're
presumably
going
to
work
there.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
they're
going
to
pay
taxes
there,
their
work
is
going
to
support
the
local
economy
there.
they
as
a
family
unit
reside
in
corpus
christi,
whatever
their
reasons
are.
the
parents
will
be
participating
in
the
local
school
district
or
certainly
will
have
the
right
to,
will
be
voting
for
the
school
board.
and
to
that
extent,
that's
fully
consistent
with
our
concept
of
democracy.
it
doesn't
really
matter
why
someone
as
a
family
unit
moves
there.
children
are
different.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
that's
a
local
option
matter.
school
districts
are
not
required
to
allow
anyone
in
the
school.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
i
think
probably
most
districts
do
it.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
not
necessarily.
there
can
be
transfers
from
other
districts
where
they
don't
even
reside...
don't
even
live
in
that
district
but
their
parents--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--they
commute.
and
districts
can
take
them
under
texas
law,
subject
to
a
review
by
the
agency
to
insure
that
there
is
no
intentional
evasion
of
a
desegregation
order.
and
i
would
like
to
throw
that
in
here,
because
if
you
want
to
know
what
this
case
will
really
do
in
texas.
you
will
have
districts...
you
will
have
children
hopping
all
over
the
state
to
avoid
busing
orders.
you
know,
for
example,
i--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--if
we
lose
the
case,
that's
right.
and--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--no,
sir,
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether...
the
propriety
of
it,
but
just
where
a
federal
court
has
ordered
it--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--well,
your
honor,
i
have
three
sisters
that
have
kids
in
different
school
districts
in
texas.
all
three
of
those
districts
bus
children.
my
district
does
not.
now,
i
think
it's
folly
to
consider
that--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--busing
is
in
many
texas
school
districts,
and--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--impliedly,
it
is,
your
honor,
because
it
is
an
incentive
to
change
school
districts.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
it
certainly
will
be
one
of
the
common
reasons
that
would
be
utilized
and
would
motivate
people
to
change
school
districts
on
the
part
of
their
children.
there'd
be
other
reasons.
if
they
like
the
athletic
program.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
you'll
find
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
many
of
the
statements
that
have
been
made
up
here,
and
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
to
answer
your
question
with.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
child
won't
get
an
education
or
wasn't
getting
an
education
before
he
came
across
the
border.
when
we
raised
that
in
our
reply
brief,
they
replied
by
saying
well,
but
he
can't
learn
english.
so
i
assume
that
this
enhanced
scrutiny
that
goes
with
the
right
to
an
education
is
now
going
to
go
forward
to
the
right
to
learn
english.
is
it
going
to
go
forward
to
the
right
to
take
calculus
2
in
another
district?
i
mean,
there
must
be
a
stopping
point
somewhere,
and--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--it
would
be
possible.
we
don't
think
that's
very
wise
because
that
would
cut
an
awful
lot
of
children
out
of
school
who
really
need
to
be
there.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
your
honor,
it's
not
what
most
states
do.
most
states
either
go
a
parent
or
guardian
residence
restriction,
or
parent
or
guardian
along
with
the
texas
system
of
allowing
custodial
relationships
as
long
as
it's
not
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
school.
in
this
regard,
i'd
like
to
point
out--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--that's
right.
he
wouldn't
have
any
problems.
in
fact,
our
statute
is...
as
we
believe,
it's
the
wisest
type
of
statute
you
can
have
because
it
lets
children
go
to
school
where
they
need
to
be,
but
doesn't
create
state
incentives
to
send
them
different
places.
otherwise,
you
do.
now,
very,
very
few
states
in
this
nation...
indeed,
i
haven't
found
a
single
case
in
my
research
where
they
use
the
wide-open,
temporary
de
facto
rule.
and
i
believe
that
you
will
have
to
go
to
a
rule
like
that,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
for
all
50
states
in
order
to
strike
the
texas
statute.
because
certainly,
if
the
parents
or
guardians-only
laws,
which
are
at
issue
in
several
other
states,
are
constitutional,
then
texas's
more
liberal
law,...
or
it
would
seem
certainly
would
be...
or
at
least
it
would
take
care
of
the
right
to
travel
question.
if
the
child
doesn't
have
a
right...
if
the
parents
don't
have
a
right
to
send
the
child,
the
child
doesn't
have
a
right
to
go,
for
example,
in
one
of
these
states
that
restricts
it
to
parents
or
guardians
only,
to
another
district
other
than
where
his
parents
or
guardian
resides,
then
that
fairly
well
ends
the
right
to
travel
question.
it
ends
any
inquiry
concerning
the
first
classification
in
this
statute,
and
that
is
custodians
versus
guardians
or
parents.
the
second
classification
in
this
statute
deals
with
the
purpose
for
the
residence.
now,
it
would
seem
that
when
you
are
adopting
a
more
progressive,
liberal
approach
than
you're
required
to,
that
absent
a
suspect
classification...
and
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
cases
in
this
court
to
indicate
that
the
test
of
purpose
would
be
suspect...
that
should
only
be
reviewed
under
a
rational
basis
standard.
and
i
believe
that
we
have...
well,
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
had
a
compelling
state
interest
in
this
test.
and
certainly,
we
have
vastly
more
than
a
rational
basis
to
try
to
prevent
students
from
jumping
all
over
the
state
from
district
to
district,
or
students
coming
in
across
state
lines
for
only
the
reason
of
going
to
school
without
their
parents
and
without
a
relocation
of
the
family
unit
and
participation
in
the
democratic
process
in
texas.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
this
child
is
paying
tuition,
by
the
way.
this
idea
of
an
injunction
pending
appeal
is
truly
a
red
herring.
the
child
is
attending
school
because
they
posted
a
bond
to
cover
his
tuition.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
the
bond
they
posted
was
$1244.
i
don't
know
if
the
record
expressly
states
what
the
tuition
is.
normally,
it's
around
$1000
in
texas
school
districts.
that's
about
what
they
would
get
from
the
state,
although
i
think
mcallen
probably--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--if
the
district...
but
that's
not
the
statute.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
let
me
differentiate
between
the
district's
policy
of
accepting
children
with
a
tuition,
and
the
state
statute
which
denies
state
funding
and
also,
does
not
require
the
districts
to
accept
children
under
these
circumstances.
the
state's
statutes,
i
believe,
would
not
be
in
question
because
of
the
district's
particular
policy
of
whether
or
not
they
pay
tuition.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
that
is
undoubtedly
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
also
a
case
where
the
plaintiffs
amended
their
pleadings
to
drop
any
allegations
concerning
the
merit
of
the
statute's
application
in
mcallen,
and
the
attack
is
on
the
statute
on
its
face.
and
the
statute
on
its
face
does
not
say
a
word
about
tuition.
that
was
my
point.
i
would
question
what
interest
would
support
any
state
statute,
even
requiring
residency,
even
requiring
this
de
facto
residency.
what
interest
would
a
school
district
have
from
having
a
child
come
in
every
day
and
go
to
school?
what
interest
would
the
state
have
in
preventing
that,
other
than
the
interests
assure...
that
are
underneath
and
underlie
21.031(d)?
i
believe
it's
entirely
the
same
interests.
the
interests
are
that
the
child
is
part
of
a
family
unit,
it
is
part
of
the
democratic
unit
of
that
locale
and
are
participants
in
the
economy
and
in
the
political
process,
if
they're
citizens,
for
example,
and
all
of
the
normal
indicia
and
all
the
normal
attributes
of
participating
in
a
democratic
system.
it's
also
obviously,
to
prevent
people
from
jumping
around
the
state
for
whatever
reasons.
it
could
be
because
there's
a
football
powerhouse
and
this
fellow
wants
to
get
a
scholarship
at
notre
dame,
so
he
wants
to
go
play
for
this
particular
coach
that
has
connections
at
notre
dame.
that
undoubtedly
will
arise.
there's
certainly
ample
basis
under
the
statute
for
the
texas
statute,
and
indeed,
the
approach--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
every
child
in
mcallen
could
have
a
guardian
appointed
for
him
with
the
amount
of
money
legal
aid
spent
bringing
this
case
up
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
it
is
not
exorbitant.
we
have
pauper
zones
in
texas,
we
have
legal
services
available.
it
is
not
difficult.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
once
again,
our
statutes
require
that
an
application
for
guardianship
show
the
necessity
for
the
appointment
of
a
guardian.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
according
to
the
plaintiffs,
in
one
case
out
of
brownsville,
it
was
refused
on
that
basis.
that
was
not
deemed
to
be
a
sufficient
reason.
and
there
are
cases
from
other
states
where
it's
been
refused
also
on
that
basis
because
it's
an
intentional
frustration
of
the
intent
of
the
residency
statute.
and--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--no,
couldn't
do
that
because--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--for
the
purpose
of
going
to
school?
i
don't
even
know
if
you
can
be
safe
in
that.
i'm
just
saying
there's
been
one
case
where
a
probate
court
refused
it.
there
are
no
appellate
cases
on
the
subject
as
to
whether
this
would
be
deemed
sufficient
reason
for
appointment
of
a
guardian.
so
that's
really
an
open
question
under
texas
law.
i
would
argue,
if
i
were,
in
fact,
in
state
court
on
the
question
and
representing
a
school
district,
i
would
argue
that
the
obvious
intent
of
the
legislature
is
that
you
don't
frustrate
the
requirements
of
the
residence
statute
by
letting
guardians
be
appointed
when
there's
no
necessity.
and
the
only
reason
they
want
a
guardian
is
so
they
can
go
to
school.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
your
honor,
he
doesn't.
the
guardian's
powers
are
co-extensive
to
what
we
call
managing
conservator,
which
are
co-extensive
with
the
parent.
a
custodian
has
a
few
narrowly-specified
powers
granted
to
him
in
the
statute
more
out
of
necessity
than
anything
else.
he
has
the
power
to
consent
for
medical
treatment,
for
example,
and
that's
obviously
a
necessity.
i
don't
really
think
that
the
ability
of
the
custodian
to
consent
is
a
major
issue
in
this
case.
i
don't
really
believe
that's
one
of
the
major
underpinnings
of
the
statute...
whether
or
not
the
child
is
with
a
responsible
adult,
and
i
don't
think
that
will
be
the
major
underpinnings
in
any
state
residency
statute
because
they're
all
apt
to
allow
the
same
type
of
system.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
now,
i
think
if
he
needs
a
guardian
appointed
for
him
to
exercise
his
rights--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--and
to
exercise
his
rights.
then
he
undoubtedly
will
get
a
guardian
appointed.
we
even
have
a
provision
for
out-of-state
residents
to
have
a
guardian
appointed
where
they
have
property
in
the
state
and
some
reason
for
it.
so
if
he
just
needs
a
guardian
because
his
parents
are
back
in
mexico
and
he
seeks
a
guardian
in
order
to
have
someone
to
represent
him
contractually,
et
cetera
in
the
state,
undoubtedly
he'd
be
able
to
get
one
appointed.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
if
they're
as
clever
as
you
are,
they're
going
to
beat
the
system.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
i
just
point
out
that
if
the
guardian...
if
the
probate
court
was
satisfied
that
the
only
purpose
for
the
appointment
of
a
guardian
was
to
establish
school
residency,
i
can't
promise
this
court
that
a
guardianship
would
be
granted.
now,
if
he
has
some
other
legitimate
reasons,
then
it's
highly
unlikely
it
wouldn't
be
granted.
it's
much
the
same
as
judge
garza
and
judge
case
and
both
district
judges
that
reviewed
the
facts
in
this
case
and
reviewed
the
reports
filed
by
the
district
said,
that
the
way
the
district
applies
this,
although
it's
not
before
the
court,
is
quite
liberal.
and
if
they
can
find
another
reason
for
the
child
to
be
here
other
than
to
take
advantage
of
school,
they'd
let
him
in.
i
think
the
same
type
of
thing
is
going
to--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--well,
in
terms
of
the
way
the
statute
applies
to
this
particular
litigant
even,
their
argument
could
only
be
that
the
state
has
a
constitutional
duty
to
discriminate
in
his
favor,
because
it
seems
to
me
beyond
doubt
that
texas
can
avoid
the
problems,
both
short
term
and
long
term,
in
terms
of
their
effect
on
school
districts
and
their
control,
from
students
hopping
around
different
parts
of
the
state,
from
students
going
from
dallas
out
to
the
suburbs,
from
students
going
from
houston
to
austin
even.
and
from
students
going
from
louisiana
into
texas.
although
that's
interstate
travel,
it's
certainly
not
the
same
type
of
interstate
travel
this
court
was
dealing
with
in
shapiro
and
gaddis,
which
involved
a
bona
fide
change
in
residence
on
the
part
of
a
family.
i
don't
think
it's
debatable.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
we
talked...
that's
the
only
place
where
we've
got
illegal
aliens
from,
your
honor.
but
in
terms
of
the
potential
for
students
coming
in,
i
think
you'll
find
east
texas
guidance
center
versus
brockett
deals
with
students
from
louisiana.
i
think
that
you'll
find
that--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--that
was
a
particular
child
care
institution
there.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
the
testimony
of
the
superintendents
in
this
case
was
that
there
will
be
thousands
come
in
from
interstate
or
international.
they
didn't
differentiate.
as
to
the
numbers,
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor,
to
support
a
conclusion
as
to
what
the
major
effect
of
this
statute
is.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
there's
certainly
plenty
in
the
case
law
on
that.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
no,
your
honor,
but
i
would
indicate
that--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--well,
i
imagine
the
other
ones
would
only
make
one
hop,
too.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
yes,
your
honor.
strictly
speaking,
the
statute
does
not
relate
to
interstate
travel
at
all;
it
relates
to
inter-district
travel
or
coming
in...
or
actually,
it
doesn't
relate
to
travel
at
all.
it
relates
to
the
reason
for
your
presence
in
a
district.
now,
you
may
have
been
in
that
district
since
you
were
born,
you
may
have
come
from
a
neighboring
district,
you
may
have
come
from
louisiana,
from
mexico
or
from
peru.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
for
example,
new
hampshire
has
the
same
law.
north
dakota
i'd
have
to
check
in
my
brief
and
see
which
one
they
have.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
obviously
not.
obviously,
in
1851
when
new
hampshire
supreme
court
set
this
rule,
it
was
to
preserve
school
districts,
and
to
prevent--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--yes,
your
honor,
i
deny
that.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
because
it's
been
a
doctrine
in
texas
law
since
1903.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
and
the
case
came
up
in
1905...
this
was
at
a
time
that,
you
have
to
remember,
that
the
state
also
educated
any
mexicans
that
came
in
and
it
had
no
rules
against
educating
illegal
aliens.
so
on
that
basis,
i
think
i'm
fairly
sound
in
saying
that
it
was
not
aimed
at
them.
the
attorney
general's
opinion
concerning
rockdale
makes
no
mention
in
1905...
apparently,
it
was
farmers.
now,
it
does
not
make
a
mention
as
to
the
race
of
the
children
involved.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
you
have
a
district
court
finding
that
one
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
impede
people
coming
in
from
mexico
to
go
to
school.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
well,
i
think
you
can
look
at
the
factual
underpinnings
of
it
because
the
district
court
fell
victim
to
what
this
court
rejected
in
o'brien,
united
states
versus
o'brien.
the
district
court
used
the
expression
of
one,
single
legislator
who
was
not
even
a
sponsor
of
this
bill.
and
when
you
read
what
he
said,
coupled
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
at
most
his
intention
was
to
do
what
the
statute
does,
and
that
is
keep
people
from
coming
in--
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
you
do.
and
also,
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court
made
another
finding,
that
the
main
purpose
was
to
provide
a
statutory
guideline
of
residency.
that
was
the
district
court's
first
finding
on
it,
and
it
said
a
purpose,
one
purpose,
was--
now,
if
you
look
at
the
factual
underpinnings
of
that
in
order
to
understand
what
the
district
court
was
saying,
what
it
was
really
saying
is
that
we
had
one
legislator
down
there
in
austin
who
said
this.
that's
the
evidence.
the
other
legislator
whose
testimony
is
in
the
record
was
the
sponsor
and
said
primarily,
it
was
to
codify
the
attorney
general
opinions.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
the
district
court
has
a
finding
that
children
like
this
do
not
generally
pay
taxes,
and
the
cost
of
their
education
will
have
to
be
borne
by
the
bona
fide
residents
of
that
district.
mr.
richard
l.
arnett
he
talked
about
overcrowding,
he
talked
about
the
inter-district
transfers
and
how
they
would
disrupt
the
educational
system.
he
concluded
with
a
finding
that
in
all
likelihood,
if
this
statute
did
not
exist
it
would
be
detrimental
to
the
educational
standards
of
the
school
districts
of
texas.
and
that
finding
was
affirmed
by
the
fifth
circuit.
now,
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
this
motivational
approach
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
rather
interesting
point
in
this
case.
you
don't
have
a
disparate
impact.
this
statute
applies
equally
to
everyone.
it
in
no
way
has
a
different
effect
on
one
group
of
persons
than
any
other
group
of
persons.
as
such,
it
seems
to
us
that
united
states
versus
o'brien,
palmer
versus
thompson,
brown
versus
califano
which
was
quoted
in
the
proffered
case
last
term,
all
say
that
you
don't
look
at
motive.
but
in
any
event,
the
motive
factually,
the
district
court
found
the
dominant
motive
was
to
codify
or
to
provide
a
statutory
definition
of
residence.
previous
to
that,
it
had
merely
been
common
law
as
indicated
by
the
attorney
general
opinions
in
the
deleon
court.
now,
we
have
used
in
texas
precisely
the
standard
this
court
set
forth
in
vlandis
versus
kline
for
determining
bona
fide
residency.
this
purpose
test
was
also
used
in
sosna
versus
iowa,
it
is
used
in
starns
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court,
it
was
set
forth
in
various
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
on
the
same
issues
such
as
the
spriggs
case
and
the
zoben
case.
we
have
used
what
we
believe
to
be
the
best
system.
we
don't
see
where
colorado's
system
is
as
good.
they
require
the
child
to
intend
to
reside
there
indefinitely.
well,
he
may
not
need
to
reside
there
indefinitely
for
his
health
reasons
or
whatever
brought
him
there.
this
also,
i
would
point
out,
allows
us
to
have
a
workable
system
for
the
education
of
handicapped
children.
under
a
de
facto
residency
approach,
which
analytically
is
the
only
thing
one
could
go
to
to
strike
this
statute,
and
a
temporary
de
facto
at
that,
if
houston
were
to
place
a
child
in
austin
at
a
residential
facility
for
the
purposes
of
an
education,
he's
paying
$100,000
a
year,
upon
his
arrival
to
austin
he'll
become
a
resident
of
austin
and
austin
will
become
responsible
for
that
$100,000
a
year.
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense.
by
the
same
token,...
and
that
is
one
reason
we
have
the
disqualification
concerning
educational
purposes,
or
that's
one
end
that
it
serves.
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
we
have
things
called
icfmrs,
intermediate
care
facilities
for
the
mentally
retarded,
where
parents
place
children;
they've
never
taken
the
kid
to
the
home
district.
the
home
district's
never
had
a
shot
to
see
if
they
could
provide
an
appropriate
education
for
this
kid,
but
the
kid
may
be
500
miles
across
the
state
in
an
icfmr.
by
regulation,
we
have
required
the
district
where
that
icfmr
is
located
to
provide
an
education
to
those
children,
so
long
as
they
are
not
there
for
an
education,
primarily
for
educational
reasons.
otherwise,
we
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
delivering
services
to
those
children
because
the
district
of
responsibility
would
be
500
miles
away
and
never
have
seen
the
child.
our
system
works
very
well
in
texas
for
a
lot
of
different
reasons.
it
works
very
well
in
a
number
of
other
areas
for
a
lot
of
different
reasons.
it's
the
common
law
of
this
country
in
school
residency
matters.
and
we
also
believe
it
should
be
upheld
as
constitutional.
