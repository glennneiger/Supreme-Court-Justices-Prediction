justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
are
you
making
a
facial
attack
on
this
statute,
or
as
applied
to
a
particular
client?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you're
not
arguing
that
the
statute
has
been
applied
discriminatorily,
are
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
judge
garza
found
as
a
fact
that
it
was
not
being
so
applied,
didn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
didn't
find
any
discriminatory
enforcement,
did
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
applies
equally
to
children
coming
from
mexico
as
it
would
to
children
coming
from
any
other
school
district
in
the
state,
wouldn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
see.
counsel,
you
rely
on
the
fundamental
right
to
travel.
does
that
mean
that
in
the
united
states
a
child
may
pick
any
school
district
it
wishes
to
pick,
so
long
as
it
complies
with
the
residence
provisions
of
that
school
district,
or
has
a
constitutional
right
to
go
there,
regardless
of
where
his
parents
may
live?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
perhaps
not
in
this
case,
but
there
may
be
many
similar
cases.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
take
my
simple
question.
suppose
a
child
lives
very
close
to
a
state
that
has
excellent
schools.
i
think
justice
rehnquist
suggested
this
sort
of
problem.
he
lives
right
close
to
the
boundary
line.
by
going
across,
the
child
can
attend
schools
of
much
superior
quality.
you
suggest
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
go?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know.
i'm
going
back
to
your
statement.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
you
have
people
here
in
your
case
who
are
perfectly
willing...
if
they
were
willing
to
accept
the
child,
the
child
could
attend
the
schools.
but
they
elect
not
to
do
so.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
fundamental
right
to
travel
on
which
you
rely
applies
only
to
indigents?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
arnett,
you
and
justice
marshall
were
talking
about
moving
from
mexico
to
texas
or
from
state
to
state,
but
this
statute
applies
to
moving
from
district
to
district,
does
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
states
in
remote
areas
so
far
as
mexico
is
concerned
have
similar
laws?
what
about
north
dakota?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
have
the
same
law
for
what
purpose?
to
keep
mexicans
out?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
district
court
also
mentioned,
as
i
recall,
counsel,
the
state's
interest
in
the
tax
burden,
so
that
children
couldn't
choose
districts
without
having
parents
or
guardians
who
contributed
to
that...
who
helped
relieve
the
tax
burden.
district
court
mentioned
that,
didn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
district
court
also
mentioned
the
importance
of
school
boards
being
able
to
plan
from
year
to
year
as
to
pupil-teacher
ratio,
load,
et
cetera,
didn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
texas
law
requires
a
school
district
to
provide
tuition
free
education
for
all
children
who
are
residents
of
the
district.
the
law
permits
charging
tuition
to
children
whose
presence
in
the
district
is
for
the
primary
purpose
of
attending
the
free
public
schools.
petitioner
is
a
custodian
of
a
child,
an
american
citizen
of
mexican
parentage,
who
was
living
in
the
texas
school
district
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
attending
school
there.
the
custodian
brought
this
suit
to
challenge
the
texas
law
on
its
face.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
a
law
we
now
affirmed.
a
state
may
limit
its
free
public
school
education
to
residence.
thus,
a
bona
fide
residence
requirement
neither
offends
the
equal
protection
clause
nor
burdens
the
constitutional
right
of
interstate
travel.
residents
traditionally
require
physical
presence
and
the
present
intention
to
remand.
therefore,
texas
were
justified
in
requiring
more
than
a
presence
in
the
school
district,
where
there
presence
was
primarily
to
attend
free
public
schools.
we
decide
only
that
the
statute
is
valid
on
its
face.
justice
brennan
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
