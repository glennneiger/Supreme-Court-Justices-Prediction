texas
doesn't
object
to
the
right
to
travel
back
to
mexico,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
record
show,
when
this
child
was
admitted,
what
did
the
sister
sign
on
the
application
blank?
i
assume
that
texas
has
an
admission
card.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--they
have
no
records?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--then
what
records
does
the
school
have
as
to
who
to
call
up
if
the
child
drops
dead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
what,
guardian?
justice
thurgood
marshall
custodian.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i'm
not
interested
in
the
statute;
i'm
interested
in
this
case.
does
this
record
show
what
position
she
has
insofar
as
the
school
is
concerned?
if
she
is
a
legal
guardian
she's
one
thing.
if
she
is
a
disinterested
passerby,
she's
another
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
it
show
that
she
signed
as
a
relative,
as
a
parent,
as
a
substitute
parent,
or
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
legal
aid
in
this
county?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
we've
got
to
decide
busing
again?
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
ever
heard
of
a
red
herring?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
busing
is
not
here,
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
busing
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
impliedly,
guns
are
too,
aren't
they?
you
can
imply
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
this
child
change
because
of
busing?
did
anybody
in
this
district
change
because
of
busing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
texas,
do
you
have
any
problems
from
students
from
any
other
state
other
than
the
government
of
mexico?
in
texas.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
your
only
problem?
that's
what
they
told
us
in
this
other
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
would
that
encompass?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
a-1,
where
you
have
hundreds
and
thousands
of
mexicans,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
hopping,
either,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there's
nothing
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
petitioner
didn't
hop
to
but
one
place.
he
only
made
one
hop.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
deny
that
this
one
was
to
keep
mexicans
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
give
me
what
proof
you
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there
were
no
mexicans
in
1903?
[laughter]
