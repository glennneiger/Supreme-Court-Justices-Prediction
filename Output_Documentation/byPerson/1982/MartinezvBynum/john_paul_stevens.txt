justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
the
child
was
in
school
now.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
pursuant
to
court
order,
or
how
does--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
had
missed
that
in
the
papers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
court
of
appeals
left
that
injunction
in
force
and
has
not
ruled
against
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
why
this
is
limited
to
indigents.
supposing
you
have
an
american
family
living
in
mexico
city,
a
very
wealthy
family,
but
they
don't
like
the
schools
there
and
they
want
to
send
their
wealthy
child
to
this
school
in
this
school
district
and
they
have
a
friend
who
will
take
the
child
in.
the
only
way
they
can
do
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
have
a
guardian
appointed,
and
you
said
well,
you
can't
do
that
without
severing
the
parental
relationship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
a
private
school
in
this
district.
they
don't
have
to...
say
they
don't
want
to
pay
tuition.
they
want
to
go
to
this
school.
they
have
a
very
good
faculty
and
a
good
student
body
and
a
good
football
team.
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
it,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
and
united
states
citizen
parents
who,
for
personal
reasons,
live
in
paris
or
london
or
someplace.
don't
they
have
the
same
constitutional
right
that
you're
talking
about
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
indigency
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
a
constitutional
matter,
could
not
this
particular...
could
not
texas
require
that
if
any
child
is
to
live
separate
and
apart
from
his
parents,
he
must
have
a
legal
guardian
appointed?
as
a
constitutional
matter,
could
they
impose--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
reason
that
justice
o'connor
referred
to,
they
want
to
have
someone
who
is
legally
responsible
for
decisionmaking
on
behalf
of
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
for
kind
of
a
general
question?
your
opponent
has
said
there
are
difficulties
about
getting
a
guardianship,
and
if
you
have
a
guardianship
even
for
terminating
it.
is
it
expensive,
and
is
it
as
much
of
a
problem
as
your
opponent
indicates?
do
you
accept
his
representations
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
yes,
but
this
is
not
a
typical--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
is
there
a
procedure
for
having
a
guardian
appointed
for
an
indigent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
in
this
very
case
the
sister
came
in
and
said
she
wanted
to
be
appointed
the
guardian
so
the
child
could
go
to
school.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
should
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
this
child
could
not
have
obtained
a
guardianship.
of
course,
i
realize
it's
not
an
as-applied
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
must
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
a
significant
number
of
children
who
could
not
get
guardianships
in
texas
but
who
want
to
live
with
their
sisters
or
some
similar
custodian.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
custodian
have
the
same
decisionmaking
authority
as
a
guardian
would?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
you
might
have
a
problem
if
an
american
citizen
says
i
want
to
live
in
this
county
for
whatever
reason,
i
have
a
right
to
do
that,
and
i
would
like
to
have
a
guardian
appointed
who
can
make
decisions
for
me
because
i'm
only
12
years
old
or
11
years
old.
and
texas
might
say
well,
we
won't
do
that
because
a
consequence
of
that
might
be
then
you
might
get
to
go
to
school.
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
because
he's
12
years
old
and
that's
where
he
wants
to
live.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
only
reason
he's
there
is
he
hopes
after
this
guardianship
has
been
appointed,
he'd
like
to
go
to
school
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
take...
you're
not
very
clever
to
figure
that
one
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess
i
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
understanding
a
facial
attack
on
a
statute
brought
by
a
litigant,
and
we
don't
care
how
the
statute
applies
to
the
particular
litigant.
it's
a
very
puzzling
constitutional
posture
for
a
case
of
this
kind,
for
me.
maybe
i
just
have
a
problem
that
others
don't
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question
about
that,
if
i
may.
is
it
correct,
then,
that
the
case
as
it
comes
to
us
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
hypothetical
involving
the
wealthy
family
abroad
who
want
their
child
to
go
the
school
without
paying
tuition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
issue...
if
we're
not
concerned
with
the
impact
on
the
particular
litigant,
is
the
constitutional
issue
is
the
same
as
the
hypothetical
case
i
posed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
that's
hardly
a
facial
attack.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
he
ever
applied
for
a
guardianship,
or
had
his
sister
apply
for
a
guardianship
and
was
turned
down.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
she
couldn't
have
tried
that
route,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
apparently
posted
a
bond
to
go
to
school,
according
to
your
opponent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
know
the
facts
as
to
the
particular
litigant,
is
what
i
am
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
know
the
impossibility
of
this
litigant
attending
this
school
by
some
other
means
because
you
haven't
tried
out
all
the
aspects
of
the
impact
of
the
statute
on
this
litigant.
