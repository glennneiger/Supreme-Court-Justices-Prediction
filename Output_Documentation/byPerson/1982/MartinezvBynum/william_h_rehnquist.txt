mr.
tuddenham,
where
in
your
brief
is
that
statute
set
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
certainly,
the
statute
can
serve
some
legitimate
purposes,
can't
it?
i
don't
suppose
that
wealthy
parents
can
live
in
a
poor
school
district
that
doesn't
do
much
in
the
way
of
taxing
property
and
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
their
child
live
with
a
step-sister
in
a
very
wealthy
school
district.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i'm
assuming
that
the
parents
don't
want
to
pay
the
school
taxes
in
the
high
taxing
district,
but
they
want
their
child
to
be
educated
there
and
they're
perfectly
willing
to
have
the
child
take
up
legal
residence
with
a
step-sister.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
doesn't
the
state
have
a
perfectly
legitimate
interest
in
seeing
that
what
you
say
the
statute
doesn't
prohibit
doesn't
happen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fact
that
new
york
and
pennsylvania
might
allow
parents
to
do
this
doesn't
mean
that
texas,
under
the
constitution,
has
to
allow
it,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
argue,
then,
that
if
i'm
a
parent
and
live
in
a
very
wealthy
school
district
and
my
14-year
old
child...
rather,
i'm
a
parent
who
lives
in
a
poor
district
but
i
want
my
child
to
go
to
a
district
where
there
is
a
good
deal
better
education
because
of
a
high
tax
rate
but
i
don't
want
to
move
into
that
district
because
i
don't
want
to
pay
the
high
tax
rate,
so
i
simply
farm
my
child
out
to
a
step-sister
in
the
high
tax
rate
district,
that
the
state
can't
prevent
that
under
the
constitution,
because
a
14-year
old
child
has
a
right
to
travel
from
one
school
district
to
another?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
suppose
if
district-hopping
is
what
they
want
they
may
have
a
tough
time
coming
up
with
a
phony
reason
that
passes
muster.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if,
in
fact,
the
reason
is
the
desire
to
obtain
an
education,
i
suppose
that
whoever
decides
whether
the
reason
is
true
or
not
would
make
some
inquiry
into
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
just
ask
you
one
more
question
in
response
to
your
response
to
justice
o'connor.
i
suppose
if
a
person
teaches
in
college,
he
may
get
a
visiting
professorship
for
a
year
and
maybe
wants
to
move
into
your
district
with
his
children.
you
have
a
college
there
where
he
would
be
teaching
for
a
year.
now,
if
there
were
a
domicile
requirement
of
intent
to
remain
indefinitely,
he
couldn't
meet
that,
and
yet
he
would
certainly
be
a
bona
fide
resident,
i
suppose,
in
terms
of
your
statute,
for
a
year,
wouldn't
he?
