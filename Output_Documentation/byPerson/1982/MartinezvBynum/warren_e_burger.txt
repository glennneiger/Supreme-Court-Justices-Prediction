we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
oralia
martinez
against
raymon
bynum.
mr.
tuddenham,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
extent
do
you
rely
on
a
constitutional
right
to
travel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
must
be
taking
the
position
that
a
child
of
three,
four,
five,
six
years
of
age
has
the
same
constitutional
right
to
travel
as
an
adult
citizen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
you
said
constitutional
right,
their
constitutional
right
to
travel
that
i
had
put
to
you
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
this
court
should
decide
that
an
infant
child
has
no
constitutional
right
to
travel,
does
that
wash
your
case
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
your
statement
is
consistent
with
the
stipulation
of
fact
that
justice
white
just
read
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
arnett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes
remaining,
mr.
tuddenham.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
mean
that
texas
should
support
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
martinez
against
bynum
will
be
announced
by
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
