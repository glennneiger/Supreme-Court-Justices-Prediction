justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
i
was
going
to
ask
exactly
the
same
question,
because
i
think
the
record
for
me
is
somewhat
confusing
as
to
whether
you
were
making
a
facial
or
an
as-applied
challenge,
and
i
take
it
your
answer
to
justice
powell
is
that
now
you're
making
a
facial
challenge.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
you
do,
then,
about
the
boarding
house
situation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
that
this
petitioner
intends
to
stay
in
the
united
states
after
he's
been
educated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
takes
us
right
back
to
the
question
i
think
that
was
implicit
in
something
that
justice
o'connor
asked.
who's
boss
here,
the
parents
or
the
child?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
it's
irrelevant,
but
how
did
he
happen
to
be
born
in
the
united
states?
