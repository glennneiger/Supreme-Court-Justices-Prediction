do
you
think
the
child
has
a
right,
independent
of
the
parent,
if
the
child
is
unemancipated,
to
establish
his
own
residency
independently--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
is
the
general
test
of
residency
for
school
purposes
in
texas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
cite
for
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
other
than
the
arguments
in
plyler.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
requiring
children
who
are
living
apart
from
their
parents
to
live
with
a
legal
guardian
as
a
pre-condition
to
admission
to
public
school?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
it
would
be
valid
for
a
state
to
say
if
the
child
is
living
apart
from
the
parents,
we
require
as
a
condition
of
going
to
school
that
the
child
be
living
with
a
legal
guardian?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
can
we
assume?
that
the
child
might
need
medical
care
and
might
need
other
permission
to
be
given
for
various
activities
and
the
school
needs
to
be
able
to
look
to
someone
who
is
legally
in
a
position
to
do
those
things.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
case
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
a
de
facto
residency?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
can
you
be
a
bona
fide
resident
for
six
months
for
purposes
of
getting
a
free
public
education?
somebody
who
goes
temporarily
to
texas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
parents
decide
that
they
like
the
public
schools
in
corpus
christi,
texas
and
they
decide
to
move
from
new
mexico
to
corpus
christi,
texas
so
their
children
can
attend
the
public
schools
there,
and
for
no
other
purpose.
is
that
all
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
they're
with
their
parents.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
my
assumption,
that
is
their
only
reason.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
texas
could
adopt
a
residency
requirement
for
public
school
purposes
that
would
require
residency
in
the
normal
sense
of
going
with
an
intent
to
remain
indefinitely.
right?
i
mean,
isn't
that
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
what
most
states
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
had
a
district
court
finding
in
this
case
on
the
purpose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
have
to
accept
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
the
posture
that
this
case
is
here,
don't
we
have
to
accept
that
finding?
