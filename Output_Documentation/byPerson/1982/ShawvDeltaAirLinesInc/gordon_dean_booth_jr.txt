mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
we
have
a
situation
which
one
would
hope
would
be
more
usual
where
the
statutory
language
is
thoroughly
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
which
is
thoroughly
consistent
with
the
policies
sought
to
be
effectuated.
it
is
clear
that
congress
was
keenly
aware
of
the
fact
that
all
federal
taxpayers
have
a
stake
in
employee
benefit
plans
through
federal
economic
encouragement
plans,
either
through
delayed
and
preferential
taxation
or
through
tax
policies
allowing
certain
benefits
to
employees
to
be
totally
free
of
tax
to
the
employee
although
deductible
to
the
employer.
it
is
also
clear
that
congress
adopted
a
policy
that
lead
to
the
statute,
erisa,
designed
to
encourage
the
voluntary
establishment,
growth,
and
expansion
of
private
employee
benefit
plans.
it
is
clear
that
congress
believed
that
one
way
to
foster
and
encourage
the
growth
and
development
of
employee
benefit
plans
was
to
give
the
plan
designers
and
participants
the
maximum
possible
flexibility
consistent
with
other
federal
laws
in
selecting
and
allocating
the
resources
available
for
employee
benefits.
it
is
clear
that
congress
believed
the
plan
should
be
allowed
to
be
administered
uniformly
throughout
all
of
the
united
states.
it
is
clear
that
congress
believed
that
the
plan
should
be
allowed
to
be
uniform
and
equitable
among
their
participants
throughout
all
of
the
united
states.
it
is
clear
that
congress
believed
that
without
preemption
of
state
laws,
interstate
plans
could
not
maintain
uniformity
and
equity
among
participants
throughout
the
united
states.
it
is
clear
that
congress
thought
that
state
laws
affecting
employee
benefit
plans
might
result
in
slowing
down
the
growth
or
even
the
possible
elimination
of
some
employment
benefit
plans.
it
is
clear
that
congress
believed
that
the
federal
government's
interest
in
employee
benefit
plans
was
comprehensive
and
pervasive
and
it
is
clear
that
congress
believed
that
this
pervasive
federal
interest
required,
with
certain
narrow
exceptions,
the
displacement
of
state
action
in
the
field
of
private
employee
benefit
plans.
it
is
clear
the
congress
intentionally,
and
after
full
debate
on
a
specific
point,
passed
a
preemption
provision
intended,
as
one
senator
said,
"to
apply
in
its
broadest
sense
to
all
actions
of
state
or
local
governments.
"
all
of
this
resulted
in
section
514(a)
of
erisa
which
states:
"these
provisions
shall
supercede
any
and
all
state
laws
insofar
as
they
may
now
or
hereafter
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plan.
"
covered
by
erisa.
there
is
no
ambiguity
of
any
kind.
there
is
no
patent
ambiguity.
there
is
no
latent
ambiguity.
the
language,
the
history,
and
the
policy
are
all
congruent.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
i
may
be,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
it
is
the
preemption
provision.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
will
have
to
check.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
it
is
514(a).
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
the
impairment
provision
as
in
alter,
amend,
or
impair
is
relating
to
federal
law
which
is
not
the
preemption
provision.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
thank
you.
we
have
been
told
that
the
policy
of
preemption
will
result
in
coverage
for
some
participants
being
different
than
otherwise
would
be
the
case
and
this
is
true.
the
benefits
provided
by
the
appellees'
employee
benefit
plans
were
different
than
they
would
have
been
if
the
state
of
new
york
had
participated
in
the
design
of
the
plans.
the
provisions
of
the
plans
were,
however,
permitted
under
federal
law.
the
views
of
the
state
of
new
york
with
regard
to
the
allocation
of
plan
resources
is
different
from
the
decision
these
employees
and
these
employers
made
with
regard
to
the
allocation
of
those
finite
resources
among
the
members
of
the
participant
groups.
it
is
also
likely
that
there
will
always
be
differences
of
opinion
between
the
states
as
to
what
is
fair
and
what
constitutes
discrimination
and,
therefore,
how
plan
resources
should
be
allocated.
it
is
not
always
clear--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
eeoc
now
would
not
technically
defer
to
a
state
agency.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
if
there
is
coverage
under
both
statutes,
the
eeoc
defers.
if
there
is
not
coverage,
the
eeoc
does
not
defer.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
if
there
is
different
coverage...
do
you
mean
if
the
laws
are
different,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
they
wouldn't
defer.
the
eeoc
is
not
allowed--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
well--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--they
are
preempted
in
the
area
of
employee
benefit
plans.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
the
present
procedure
involves
enforcement.
the
deferral
for
enforcement--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--the
eeoc
can
only
defer
if
the
state
law--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--the
eeoc
may
not
defer
if
the
state
law
doesn't
adequately
cover
the
claim.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
or
if
there
isn't
one.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
there
was
a
deferral
procedure
in
title
vii
before
and
after
erisa
was
passed.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
the
same
one.
before
erisa
was
passed,
there
may
have
been
a
state
law
which
was
preempted
by
erisa
which
no
longer
existed.
the
federal
law
has
not
changed
at
all.
what
was
illegal
in
the
federal
law
before
erisa
was
illegal
after
erisa.
there
is
no
procedure
whereby
a
claim
for
violation
of
state
fep
law
now
gets
to
be
a
federal
cause
of
action.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
i
don't
know
what
they
do,
but
i
would
assume
they
do
the
same
thing
they
do
now
if
the
employee
complains
about
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
marital
status
or
sexual
orientation
or
disability
or
any
of
the
other
bases
for
state
discrimination
that
do
not
apply
in
the
federal
area.
it
is
possible
that
an
employee
today
would
have
a
great
deal
of
different
views
as
to
why
he
was
discriminated
against
which
is
a
point
i
was
about
to
make.
it
is
not
always
clear
what
is
fair
and
unfair.
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
reached
a
contrary
view
nine
days
apart
in
1976
on
the
issue
of
pregnancy.
there
are
many
questions
now
in
sharp
debate
on
the
issue
of
what
constitutes
discrimination,
the
question
of
male/female
retirement
benefits,
questions
relating
to
order
of
layoff
upon
a
work
force
diminution,
questions
relating
to
male/female
death
benefits,
questions
relating
to
the
use
of
actuarial
tables
generally
since
they,
by
and
large,
do
not
purport
to
take
into
account
subgroup
characteristics.
there
are
many
plan
choices
which
may
impact
on
different
groups
in
a
different
way,
orthodontic
coverage,
denture
coverage,
abortion
coverage,
covers
providing
for
compensation
for
eye
glasses.
some
states
have
statutes
which
prohibit
different
treatment
based
on
marital
status,
sexual
orientation,
parenthood,
disability
and
other
factors.
these
possible
limitations
on
plan
choice
lead
to
on
questions
including
the
interplay
of
marital
status
with
sexual
orientation.
is
it
discriminatory
to
limit
benefits
to
a
traditionally
defined
family
group?
should
the
concept
of
widowhood,
of
spouse,
be
expanded?
have
they
already
been
expanded
in
some
states?
no
doubt
society
will
continue
to
refine
its
ideas
in
these
areas.
it
may
be
that
our
national
society
would
express
those
views
in
federal
law
or
rulings
just
as
some
still
have
already
done.
in
the
meantime,
however,
appellees
submit
that
congress
has
concluded
that
more
people
will
be
better
served
by
encouraging
the
establishment,
growth,
and
proliferation
of
employee
benefit
plans
and
within
the
limits
of
federal
discrimination
law
to
allow
the
parties
involved
to
allocate
the
resources
available
in
ways
that
seem
to
them
to
best
serve
their
needs
and
to
be
equitable,
fair,
and
uniform
throughout
all
of
the
united
states.
the
parties
here
made
a
choice
on
allocation
of
benefits
permitted
by
federal
law.
the
state
of
new
york
says
that
the
choice
cannot
be
made.
the
new
york
law
clearly
relates
to
erisa
plans
and
is,
therefore,
preempted
by
514(a)
of
erisa.
we
have
been
told
that
the
broad
preemption
provision
of
erisa
does
not
apply
to
state
fep
laws.
erisa
does,
indeed,
provide
specific
exemptions
of
its
sweeping
preemption
provisions.
it
provides
specific
exemptions
for
state
security
laws,
state
insurance
laws,
state
banking
laws,
and
relevant
state
criminal
laws.
it
does
not
provide
a
specific
exemption
for
state
federal
employment
practice
laws.
erisa
also
provides
in
514(e)
that
it
does
not
alter,
amend,
modify,
or
impair
any
federal
law.
it
is
here,
we
are
told,
that
congress
intended
to
exempt
state
fair
employment
practice
laws
from
exemption.
are
the
state
federal
employment
practice
laws
exempted
from
preemption
by
the
fact
that
no
federal
laws
are
changed?
the
argument
is
that
it
is
not
since
title
vii
provides
that
all
state
laws
not
in
conflict
with
it
are
not
affected
by
it,
all
state
laws.
and,
since
it
is
a
federal
law
not
altered
by
erisa,
its
provision
disclaiming
any
effect
on
state
law
not
in
conflict
with
it
is
not
altered.
and,
it
is
also
argued
that
the
state
fep
laws
have
become
federal
laws
because
of
their
involvement
in
the
enforcement
scheme
of
title
vii.
federal
laws
in
the
securities,
insurance,
and
banking
areas
all
also
contain
similar
provisions
disclaiming
any
intent
to
preempt
state
laws
in
those
areas,
but
congress
nevertheless
specifically
excepted
state
laws
in
these
areas
from
the
preempted
provisions
of
erisa.
the
title
vii
language
is
not
specific.
it
states
that
title
vii
does
not
relieve
any
person
from
any
liability,
duty,
penalty
or
punishment.
the
adea
contains
a
similar
provision,
yet
its
legislative
history
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
its
sponsors
believed
that
all
state
fep
laws
relating
to
age
discrimination
were
preempted
by
erisa.
since
the
language
in
the
enforcement
scheme
is
indistinguishable
for
title
vii,
this
would
seem
to
be
conclusive
evidence
of
the
import
and
effect
of
the
language
in
erisa.
appellants
argue
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
adea
is
different
because
that
federal
law
contains
a
provision
that
age
considerations
are
allowed
under
federal
law
in
connection
with
the
structure
of
employee
benefit
plans
and,
therefore,
the
federal
law
would
not
be
altered
by
the
preemption
of
state
laws
pertaining
to
age
consideration
in
employee
benefit
plans.
with
all
respect,
it
seems
to
appellees
that
the
argument
misses
the
point.
the
policies
of
employee
benefit
plans
under
consideration
today
were
also
fully
allowed
under
federal
law.
there
was
no
conflict
whatsoever
with
title
vii.
in
both
the
case
of
title
vii
and
adea,
the
policy
in
question
would
be
fully
legal
under
federal
law
and
the
preemption
provision
of
erisa
would
apply
to
any
state
law
related
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
including
the
age
aspects
as
well
as
any
other
aspect
of
any
such
state/federal
employment
practice
law
relating
to
any
employee
benefit
plan.
if
the
state
of
new
york
decided,
justice
stevens,
that
a
policy
of
fixing
benefits
for
retirement
at
an
employee's
normal
retirement
age,
a
policy
allowed
under
federal
law,
violated
the
age
provision
of
the
human
rights
law
and
proceeded
to
enforce
such
a
decision,
the
defense
would
be
the
preemption
provision
of
erisa,
the
provision
preempting
all
state
laws
relating
to
employee
benefit
plans.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
integrated
scheme
of
title
vii
relates
only
to
enforcement.
an
employee
complaining
about
the
policy
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
would
not
have
had
the
eeoc
defer
to
the
state
of
new
york
because
the
employee
benefit
plans
of
the
appellees
were
consistent
with
federal
law.
the
person
might
have
been
referred
to
the
state
of
new
york
since
there
was
no
federal
violation.
cooperation
exists
where
federal
and
state
requirements
are
congruent.
the
eeoc
is
not
allowed
to
defer
if
state
law
does
not
adequately
cover
the
complaint
and
it
does
not
defer,
although
it
may
refer,
where
a
federal
law
does
not
cover
the
action
complained
of.
the
scheme
involves
cooperation
in
the
enforcement
of
a
federal
law.
similarly,
the
requirement
that
the
eeoc
accord
substantial
weight
to
the
findings
of
state
agencies
relates
only
to
factual
determination
and
not
to
conclusions
of
law
concerning
the
substantive
provisions
of
title
vii.
none
of
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
appellants
involves
questions
of
substantive
law.
mr.
kremer
lost
his
case
in
this
case
court
because
he
could
not,
under
a
state
law,
found
by
this
court
to
be
at
least
as
broad
as
the
federal
law,
convince
the
state
agency
of
the
facts
necessary
to
support
his
claim.
if
new
york
amended
or
modified
its
law,
would
that
modify,
alter,
amend,
or
impair
title
vii?
if
the
substantive
bonding
and
integration
existed
such
as
suggested
by
the
appellants,
such
an
action
would
necessarily
modify
title
vii.
but,
title
vii
would
be
unchanged.
whatever
action
violated
federal
law
would
be
the
same
both
before
new
york
amended
its
law
as
well
after
new
york
amended
its
law.
no
act
by
an
employer
is
or
becomes
the
basis
for
a
federal
cause
of
action
because
of
the
state
fep
law.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
illegitimate
children
occupy
an
unusual
constitutional
status.
let
me
assume--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--state
law
required
a
payment
to
a
live-in
lover
which
is
the
san
francisco
statute,
which
was
vetoed
by
the
mayor,
as
a
spouse.
it
would
be
preempted
by
state
law.
it
may
be
that
what
you
are
asking
me
is
if
the
law
is
unclear.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
your
honor,
if
that
choice
were
clearly
allowed
under
federal
law,
they
would
be
preempted.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
i
am...
i
don't
know--
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
--insofar
as
an
employee
benefit
plan
is
concerned.
mr.
gordon
dean
booth,
jr.
and
if
that
doesn't
violate
any
provision
of
federal
law,
it
would
be
preempted.
it
would
be
preempted
in
any
event.
it
would
legal
if
it
didn't
violate
federal
law.
title
vii
leaves
virtually
all
state
laws
intact,
but
the
fact
that
it
leaves
all
state
laws
intact
does
not
transmute
those
state
laws
in
federal
law.
if
it
does,
where
is
the
boundary?
title
vii
leaves
all
state
laws
providing
a
penalty
or
imposing
a
duty
intact.
what
about
other
state
laws
relating
to
employee
benefit
plans?
do
any
filing
or
reporting
requirements
apply?
surely
a
penalty
is
provided
for
failure
to
file
a
report.
do
the
state
fiduciary
dues
apply,
state
limitations
on
investments?
title
vii's
procedural
and
enforcement
scheme
is
for
the
joint
enforcement
of
federal
law
and
it
is
comprehensive
and
demonstrates
considerable
confidence
in
the
state.
the
enforcement
scheme
does
not
somehow
serve
as
a
talisman
to
convert
the
state's
substantive
rules
into
federal
laws
so
as
to
preserve
them
from
erisa
preemption.
here,
the
choice
made
on
the
allocation
of
benefits
was
permitted
under
federal
law
and
was
not
permitted
under
state
law.
there
was
no
partnership
in
connection
with
these
plans.
there
would
have
been
no
deferral.
there
was
no
integration,
there
was
no
reliance,
there
was
no
overlap.
the
appellees,
therefore,
submit
that
it
must
be
concluded
from
a
legislative
history,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
the
policies
sought
to
be
effected,
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
all
state
laws
relating
to
employee
benefit
plans;
that
it
was
fully
aware
of
the
broad
nature
of
the
language
it
selected;
that
it
knew
that
some
statutes
might
be
preempted
which
had
not
been
specifically
considered;
and
that
it
nevertheless
made
a
considered
judgment
to
preempt
all
law
relating
to
employee
benefit
plans.
it
had
some
concern
that
attention
might
be
needed
to
deal
with
specific
problems
in
the
future
because
of
this
blanket
approach
and
it
therefore
created
a
commission
specifically
charged
to
study
the
effects
of
preemption
among
other
things.
it
cannot
be
denied
that
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
comprehensive
nature
of
this
provision
and
nevertheless
decided
that
the
public
and
the
nation
would
be
better
served
by
having
only
federal
standards
apply
in
this
relatively
narrow
area
in
order
to
encourage
the
growth
of
plans
as
well
as
the
expansion
of
plan
benefits
without
whatever
inhibiting
or
chilling
effects
which
would
or
might
result
from
state
involvement
through
the
application
of
any
law
relating
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
insofar
as
the
disability
benefit
law
is
concerned,
the
state
cannot
claim
that
the
employee
benefit
plans
of
the
appellees
are
free
from
erisa
coverage.
the
exception
in
the
statute
for
disability
benefit
laws
is
clearly
related
to
plans
not
subject
to
the
coverage
of
erisa.
this
is
a
coverage
definition
and
the
exception
is
to
erisa
coverage.
it
has
been
suggested
that
while
the
appellees
plans
may
not
be
exempt
from
erisa
coverage,
nevertheless,
certain
paragraphs
or
portions
of
the
employee
benefit
plans
are
exempt
from
coverage
and,
therefore,
because
they
are
exempt
from
the
coverage
of
erisa,
are
subject
to
state
regulation
within
the
exception.
erisa,
however,
indicates
that
the
term
"plan"
refers
to
an
integral
unit
or
program,
not
to
isolated
and
subsidiary
provisions
of
a
plan.
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
a
ruling
following
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
would
require
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
a
plan
is
maintained
solely
to
comply
and
that
this
would
impose
an
impossible
intent
test
on
the
statute
which
would
in
turn
allow
wide-spread
avoidance
of
state
law.
even
if
it
could
be
assumed
that
employers
would
seek
to
be
regulated
by
erisa
instead
of
the
state,
there
is
no
reason
to
conclude
that
a
purpose
or
intent
test
is
so
difficult
to
apply.
many
federal
statutes
now
have
such
tests,
securities
laws,
criminal
laws,
anti-trust
laws
to
name
but
a
few.
the
determination
of
purpose
is
not
only
required
by
the
statute,
there
is
no
reason
to
anticipate
any
undue
burden
in
this
application.
the
appellees
submit
that
the
question
for
determination
by
this
court
is
does
erisa
preempt
state
statutes
that
regulate
the
nature
of
the
benefits
an
employer
must
provide
in
his
erisa
regulated
employee
benefit
plan.
the
appelles
submit
that
this
court
should
find
that
a
state
statute
that
eliminates
or
adds
to
an
erisa
covered
employee
benefit
plan
features
that
are
committed
or
not
required
by
federal
law
is
preempted
by
section
514
of
erisa.
thank
you.
