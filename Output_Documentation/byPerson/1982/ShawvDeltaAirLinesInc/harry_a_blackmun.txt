justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
was
going
to
ask,
as
far
as
the
dbl
is
concerned,
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
these
cases
come
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
new
york's
human
rights
law
forbids
discrimination
in
employee
benefit
plans
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
that
state
also
has
a
disability
benefits
law
that
requires
employers
to
pay
sick
leave
benefits
to
employees
unable
to
work
because
of
pregnancy.
a
section,
514(a)
of
the
federal
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
which
we
call
erisa
states
that
with
certain
exceptions
it
supersedes
any
state
law
insofar
as
that
law
relates
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
covered
by
erisa.
and
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
still
another
federal
statute,
the
pregnancy
discrimination
act
of
1978
which
made
discrimination
based
on
pregnancy
unlawful
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
the
appellee
employers
had
benefit
plans
subject
to
erisa
that
did
not
provide
benefits
to
employees
disabled
by
pregnancy.
the
appellees
brought
these
three
separate
declaratory
actions
in
federal
court
alleging
that
the
new
york
human
rights
law
was
preempted
by
erisa
and
the
appellee
airlines
also
alleged
that
the
state's
disability
benefits
law
was
preempted.
and
thus
the
issue
here
is
that
of
preemption
by
the
federal
statute.
the
federal
district
court
held
that
the
human
rights
law
was
preempted
and
as
to
the
disability
benefits
law,
the
court
dismissed
that
portion
of
the
complaint
seeking
relief
from
it.
the
second
circuit
affirmed
as
to
the
human
rights
law
but
as
to
the
disability
benefits
law,
it
held
that
the
federal
statute's
exemption
from
preemption
applied
only
when
a
benefit
plan
is
an
integral
is
maintained
solely
to
comply
with
the
state
disability
law.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
in
part
and
vacate
in
part
those
judgments.
we
hold
that
both
new
york
laws
relate
to
an
employee
benefit
plan
within
the
meaning
of
section
514(a).
we
hold
that
the
human
rights
law
is
preempted
only
insofar
as
it
prohibits
practices
that
are
lawful
under
federal
law.
but
we
also
hold
that
the
disability
benefits
law
is
not
preempted
by
erisa
and
this
decision
is
unanimous.
