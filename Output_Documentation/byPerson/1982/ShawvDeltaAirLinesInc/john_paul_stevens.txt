justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point,
mr.
booth.
i
take
it
your
argument
then
goes
to
any
difference
in
the
plan.
it
obviously
isn't
just
related
to
pregnancy
disability.
it
would
include,
i
take
it,
a
difference
in
the
method
of
computing
years
of
services,
for
example.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
new
york
had,
under
its
human
rights
law,
computed
seniority
in
a
manner
different
than
this
court
approved
in
american
tobacco,
for
example,
and
someone
came
in
and
made
a
claim
under
the
plan
and
said
you
must
count
pre-act
seniority
or
something
like
that.
what
should
the
eeoc
do
with
such
a
complaint?
should
they
refer
it
to
the
new
york
agency
or
say,
well,
we
are
not
interested
in
what
the
new
york
agency
says?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
doesn't
part
of
the
processing
include
the
preliminary
screening
by
the
state
agency
which
first
addresses
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
begging
the
question,
because
the
statute,
at
the
time
it
was
enacted,
there
was
a
state
law.
right
before
erisa
became
effective,
there
was
a
state
statute
in
effect
in
new
york.
the
federal
statute
says,
"enactment
of
erisa
shall
not
alter
federal
statutes
prior
to
the
date
of
enactment,
there
was
a
state
law
which
involved
a
deferral
procedure.
"
"subsequent
to
the
date
of
the
statute,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
there
was
no
longer
a
deferral
procedure.
"
"was
there
or
was
there
not
an
alteration
of
the
federal
law?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
with
a
state
claim
that
has
two
counts
in
it,
one
saying
we
are
not
getting
the
entire
employment
benefit
under
the
pension
plan
and
we
are
entitled
to
it?
secondly,
we
want
back
pay
because
you
miscalculated
my
seniority.
what
does
the
eeoc
do
with
such
a
claim?
it
defers
in
part
and
treats...
there
is
a
law
for
part
of
the
claim
but
not
for
the
other
part.
i
guess
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
booth,
let
me
ask
you
another
question
if
i
may.
supposing
a
state
law
defines
the
child
for
purposes
of
inheritance
as
either
including
or
not
including
an
illegitimate
child,
something
of
that
character.
they
have
their
own
state
definition.
but,
there
is
no
federal
definition
on
the
question
of
what
a
child
is.
does
that
mean
that,
under
you
view,
since
a
plan...
it
would
be
permissible,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
to
exclude
all
illegitimate
children
from
benefits,
say,
that
a
state
law
to
the
contrary
would
be
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
these
are
state
laws
that
relate
to
the
obligation
to
pay
benefits
to
a
person
defined
in
a
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
it
is
perfectly
clear,
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
an
illegitimate
child
or
an
adopted
child
must
be
treated
like
a
natural,
legitimate
child.
but,
as
a
matter
of
negotiation
between
a
union
and
employer,
they
decided
we
will
only
provide
for
legitimate,
natural
children.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
law
to
prevent
it
that
i
know
of
any
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
it
is
negotiated
between
private
parties,
there
is
no
federal
law
that
applies
to
that.
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
anything
permitted
by
federal
law
may
not
be
prohibited
by
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and,
i
am
talking
now
about
who
is
a
child
for
purposes
of
receiving
a
death
benefit
under
a
union/employer
negotiated
plan
which
says
only
natural-born,
legitimate
children
shall
be
treated
as
children
under
this
plan.
