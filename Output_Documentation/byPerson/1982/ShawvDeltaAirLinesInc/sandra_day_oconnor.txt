justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
the
solicitor
general,
as
i
understand
it,
has
suggested
that
what
all
of
this
means
is
that
erisa
would
invalidate
new
york's
substantive
law,
but
not
its
procedural
law,
if
you
will.
would
you
address
yourself
to
that
at
some
point
in
your
discussion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
requires
sort
of
a
strained
interpretation,
doesn't
it,
to
say
that
new
york
law
is
a
federal
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
think
i
understood
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
in
quite
the
same
way.
it
appeared
to
me
that
what
was
being
suggested
was
that
new
york
can
regulate
the
employer
but
not
the
plan
and
that
new
york
could
require
employers
to
set
up
certain,
for
example,
disability
benefits,
plans,
that
do
govern
solely
the
benefits
within
the
state
of
new
york
for
that
employer
and
could
seek
enforcement
in
that
fashion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can't
new
york
require
the
employers
to
do
exactly
that?
can
new
york
enact
a
law
and
say
to
employers
you
must
maintain
a
separate
unit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
how
do
you
read
out
of
the
federal
erisa
statute
the
word
solely?
such
plan
as
maintained
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
applicable
workers'
comp
laws
or
unemployment
comp
laws?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
not
a
normal
reading
of
the
language,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
don't
we
have
to
look
at
the
language
congress
employs
initially
and
in
that
paragraph
it
is
very
difficult
to
resolve
it
in
the
way
you
are
suggesting.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
least
on
the
disability
benefits
law,
new
york
has
the
means
to
solve
the
problem
if
you
follow
the
solicitor
general's
theory,
right?
