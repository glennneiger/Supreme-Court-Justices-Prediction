william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
that
set
forth
in
the
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
say
that,
and
you
are
perfectly
correct
so
far
as
title
vii
is
concerned.
title
vii
did
intend
state
laws
to
survive
and
to
be
used.
but,
i
think
it
is
a
different
question
to
say
that
that
made
the
state
laws
that
were
allowed
to
survive
the
federal
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
simply
because
it
was
allowed
to
survive
after
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
really
title
vii
left
the
decision
as
to
employers
below
of
15
or
less
up
to
the
individual
states,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
really
neutral
as
to
what
kind
of
policy
the
state
enforced
with
respect
to
employers
of
less
than
15.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
that
it
encouraged...
that
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
it
is
simply
left
up
to
the
states,
but
rather
the
states
were,
in
your
words,
"encouraged
to
take
the
first
step?
"
would
you
have
some
of
the
legislative
history?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
after
erisa
was
passed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
they
remain
fully
applicable,
do
they
not,
title
vii
non-discrimination
provisions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
title
vii
non-discrimination
provisions
are
contained
in
the
substance
of
title
vii,
aren't
they?
and,
since
it
is
a
federal
law,
it
would
not
be
preempted
by
erisa.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean,
"go
into
the
states"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
no
question
that
congress
intended
in
1964
that
those
laws
remain
in
effect
if
they
were
in
effect
in
the
states.
it
left
that
entirely
up
to
the
states.
but,
the
question
is
what
did
congress
mean
when
they
enacted
erisa
in
1974?
it
saved
only
federal
laws,
not
state
laws
that
were
otherwise
exempted
from
preemption
by
some
other
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
simply
isn't
correct.
i
think
title
vii
was
put
together
because
congress
felt
many
states
weren't
doing
much
about
employment
discrimination
and
that
a
national
law
was
necessary
because
there
was
such
unevenness
in
the
states.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
now
referring
to
514(d)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
514(a)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
word
"impair"
in
there?
isn't
there
some
ambiguity
in
that
word?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
presently
discussing
that?
