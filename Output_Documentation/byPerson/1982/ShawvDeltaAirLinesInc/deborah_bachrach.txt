ms.
deborah
bachrach
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
distinct
issues.
first,
whether
erisa,
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974,
preempts
the
new
york
state
human
rights
law
to
the
extent
that
law
prohibits
discrimination
in
employee
benefit
plans.
the
second
issue
is
whether
erisa
preempts
the
new
york
state
disability
benefits
law.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
found
both
laws
preempted,
a
result
never
intended
by
congress
and
at
odds
with
the
language
of
erisa.
turning
first
to
the
human
rights
law,
the
dispositive
language
is
in
section
514(d)
of
erisa.
section
514(a)--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--pages
four
and
five
of
the
blue
brief.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
erisa,
section
514(a),
provides
that
erisa
supersedes
state
laws
which
relate
to
employee
benefit
plans.
section
514(d)
directs
that
that
language
shall
not
be
construed
so
as
to
alter,
amend,
modify,
invalidate,
impair,
or
supersede
any
law
of
the
united
states.
to
preempt
the
new
york
state
human
rights
law
would
impair
title
vii.
a
review
of
the
legislative
history
and
the
statutes
makes
clear
the
inter-relationship
between
the
state
fair
employment
laws
and
the
federal
fair
employment
law
and
shows
that
to
preempt
the
new
york
human
rights
law
would,
indeed,
impair
that
statutory
scheme.
title
vii
was
enacted
in
1964.
at
that
time,
more
than
half
the
states
had
fair
employment
legislation.
congress
examined
the
statutes
in
the
states
and
designed
the
federal
scheme
to
supplement
the
state
statutes.
in
fact,
the
role
of
the
state
proceedings
in
the
title
vii
scheme
was
so
integral
that
senator
humphrey
was
lead
to
describe
title
vii
as
a
states'
rights
or
states'
responsibility
bill.
the
importance
of
a
multi-remedy
approach
to
eradicating
employment
discrimination
was
reiterated
in
1972
when
title
vii
was
amended
to
correct
certain
deficiencies
in
the
statute
and
to
strengthen
the
national
policy
against
employment
discrimination.
again,
the
importance
of
a
multi-remedy
approach
on
the
state
level,
on
the
local
level,
and
on
the
federal
level
to
eradicate
employment
discrimination
was
reiterated.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
as
i
understand
the
solicitor's
suggestion,
he
is
saying
that
this
court
need
only
reach
the
situation
where
new
york
law
provides
more
protection
than
state
law,
but
need
not
reach
that
situation
where
the
protections
are
identical.
however,
erisa
permits
no
such
distinction.
it
does
not
support
the
solicitor
general's
approach.
erisa
seeks
to
impairing
any
federal
law
and
it
would
impair
title
vii
equally
if
the
new
york
human
rights
law
were
preempted
to
the
extent
it
went
beyond
title
vii
or
to
the
extent
it
provided
identical
protections
and
in
procedural
protection.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
we
don't
suggest
the
new
york
law
is
a
federal
law.
what
we
suggest
is
that
when
congress
developed
the
title
vii
scheme,
the
foundation
was
the
state
laws.
congress
was
aware,
and
has
always
been
aware,
that
state
laws
were
not
identical
to
the
federal
law.
and,
in
fact,
it
discussed
new
york
law
in
1964
and
noted
that
new
york's
protections
were
greater
than
those
being
offered
by
title
vii
and
congress
intended
the
states'
law
to
survive,
to
be
utilized
as
part
of
the
title
vii
process;
to
give
states
the
opportunity
to
apply
their
laws
first,
and,
indeed--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--first
of
all,
new
york
does
not,
by
any
means,
suggest
that
it
is
a
federal
law,
but
rather
to
preempt
new
york's
law
would
impair
the
federal
scheme.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
no.
that
is
obviously
the
first
step
of
our
analysis,
but
it
was
intended
to
go
beyond.
when
congress
designed
title
vii,
it
intended
the
states
to
go
beyond
title
vii.
title
vii
provided
only
the
minimum
protection.
so,
if
this
court
preempts
the
new
york
law
to
the
extent
it
goes
beyond
title
vii,
small
employers
in
this
country
will
face
no
prohibitions
against
employment
discrimination,
because
title
vii
only
covers
employers
with
more
than
15
employees.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
yes.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
i
think
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
it
encouraged
the
states
to
take
the
first
step
to
eradicate
employment
discrimination.
it
was
a
problem
on
the
state
level,
but
had
not
risen
to
being
a
problem
yet
on
the
national
level.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
1978,
when
congress
was
considering
the
pregnancy
discrimination
amendment--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--yes,
it
was
obviously...
the
history
was
three
and
four
years
later.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
lunch
break,
i
was
discussing
the
1978
pregnancy
amendment
to
title
vii.
at
that
time,
both
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report
make
clear
that
congress
assumed
that
state
laws
prohibiting
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
were
in
effect
and
would
remain
so
after
the
pregnancy
amendment.
the
house
report
and
the
senate
report
examined
the
experiences
of
employers
in
states
prohibiting
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
and
more
than
23
states
have
laws
prohibiting
such
discrimination.
and,
based
on
that,
on
the
experience
at
the
state
level,
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
concluded
that
the
economic
impact
of
these
pregnancy
amendments
would
not
be
unduly
burdensome,
because
employers
in
more
than
23
states
were
already
under
state
law
obligation
to
provide
equal
benefits
for
pregnancy
and
related
medical
conditions.
now,
this
is
particularly
significant
since
the
major
impact
of
the
pregnancy
amendment
was
in
the
context
of
employee
benefit
plans,
medical
plans,
health
plans,
disability
plans.
the
co-sponsor
of
the
pregnancy
amendment
were
senators
williams
and
javits,
who
were
two
of
the
principal
architects
of
erisa
and
it
is
never
doubted
for
a
moment
in
1978
that
state
laws
prohibiting
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy
were
in
effect
and
would
remain
so
in
the
future.
in
fact,
senator
williams
described
these
amendments
as
reinforcing
state
laws
prohibiting
employment
discrimination.
erisa,
the
legislative
history
to
erisa,
in
1974
also
underscores
that
congress
intended
state
laws
prohibiting
discrimination
in
employee
benefit
plans,
all
state
laws
to
remain
in
effect.
erisa
does
not
include
a
non-discrimination
provision,
although
in
the
debates
it
was
stated
on
more
than
one
occasion
that
discrimination
in
benefit
plans
was
to
be
considered
one
of
the
most
serious
forms
of
discrimination.
members
of
the
house
and
senate
were
dissuaded
from
offering
a
non-discrimination
amendment
to
erisa
only
upon
being
reassured
by
erisa's
sponsors
that
title
vii
non-discrimination
provisions
would
be
fully
applicable.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
if
this
court
reverses
the
second
circuit,
they
would
remain--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--we
would
suggest
otherwise.
we
would
suggest
that
title
vii
non-discrimination
provisions
start
with
title
vii
and
go
beyond
title
vii
and
go
into
the
states,
because
the
states--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--that
the
federal
scheme
in
title
vii
was
built
on
the
laws
in
effect
in
1964
in
the
states.
and,
when
congress
developed
the
scheme,
congress
intended
the
state
laws
to
remain
in
effect
and
it
was
aware
at
that
time,
in
1964--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--i
would
state
it
slightly
differently
and
i
would
say
that
what
congress
did
in
1974
was
to
make
sure
that
nothing
would...
that
the
preemption
provisions
of
erisa
would
not
be
construed
as
to
even
alter
in
any
way
the
protections
of
any
federal
law.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
yes,
and
more.
not
only
does
title
vii
saves
state
laws,
but
it
utilizes
those
state
laws
and
it
encourages
the
states
to
go
further.
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
suggest
that
this
court
could
come
up
with
a
workable
preemption
formula
which
would
save
state
laws
that
are
identical
to
title
vii
and
only
preempt
state
laws
which
provide
greater
protection
than
title
vii.
we
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
workable
formula
because
identity
of
statutory
language
does
not
mean
that
the
state
law
and
the
federal
law
give
the
same
protection
and
this
case
amply
demonstrates
that,
because
in
1976,
new
york
state's
human
rights
law
forbid
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
excuse
me.
in
1976,
new
york
state's
human
rights
law
prohibited
sex
discrimination.
in
1976,
title
vii
prohibited
sex
discrimination,
but
in
december
1976,
this
court
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
reached
contrary
conclusions
as
to
whether
or
not
that
prohibition
against
sex
discrimination
included
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
pregnancy.
so,
if
we
try
to
fashion
some
formula
which
says
which
state
laws
fall
on
which
side
of
the
line,
we
are
confronted
with
quite
a
problem,
or,
better
yet,
the
eeoc
would
be
confronted
with
a
problem,
because
every
time
the
complaint
of
discrimination
in
a
fringe
benefit
plan
was
filed
with
eeoc,
before
it
could
decide
whether
to
defer
to
the
state
agency,
as
it
is
required
to
do
by
title
vii,
it
would
first
have
to
determine
what
state
law
said
on
the
subject
of
this
type
of
discrimination.
it
would
then
have
to
decide
what
federal
law
said
on
this
type
of
discrimination
and
only
if
state
law
and
federal
law
were
identical
could
it
then
defer
to
the
state
agency.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
i
believe
that
was
the
solicitor's
argument
only
as
to
the
disability
benefits
law.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
and,
as
to
the
human
rights
law,
the
solicitor
general
took
the
position
that
new
york
state's
human
rights
law
was
preempted
to
the
extent
it
provided
protection
beyond
title
vii
and
it
urged
this
court
not
to
reach
the
situation
where
the
two
statutes
appear
to
be
congruent.
however,
we
would
suggest
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
dividing
line
between
what
appears
to
be
the
same
language
in
theory
and
in
practice
how
state
courts
and
the
federal
courts
have
interpreted
that
language
which
may
not
always
be
the
same.
if
new
york
state's
human
rights
law
is
preempted,
the
eeoc
would
be
unable
to
defer
any
complaints
of
employment
discrimination
in
benefit
plans
to
state
agencies.
that
would
mean
that
the
caseload
of
eeoc
would
rise
dramatically.
it
would
also
mean
that
the
caseload
of
the
federal
courts
would
rise
dramatically
since
the
eeoc
has
no
authority
to
order
the
employer
to
provide
any
relief.
so
that
all
victims
of
discrimination
in
employee
benefit
plans
must
now
go
through
a
court
system,
a
federal
court
system.
and,
the
administrative
agency
process
that
would
ease
the
burden
on
victims
of
discrimination
would
be
eliminated
by
preemption.
this
is
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
taken
pain
to
preserve
state
authority
in
the
area
of
employment
discrimination.
just
last
term
in
the
kremer
case
this
court
looked
at
the
relationship
between
state
laws
and
federal
laws
in
this
area
and
it
noted
the
importance
of
state
proceedings
to
federal
law
in
the
area
of
employment
discrimination
and
as
a
result
of
that
this
court
held
that
state
judgments,
state
court
judgments,
in
the
area
of
employment
discrimination
were
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
in
the
federal
courts.
any
other
decision
would
have
violated
basic
tenants
of
federalism
and
would
have
served
to
decrease
the
incentive
for
states
to
develop
effective
and
meaningful
employment
discrimination
systems.
i
cannot
think
of
anything
that
would
serve
to
reduce
the
incentive
on
states
to
develop
effective
and
meaningful
employment
discriminations
than
to
say
that
states
may
not
prohibit
discrimination
in
any
employee
fringe
benefits,
child
care,
health
benefits,
pension
benefits,
training
programs,
apprenticeship
programs.
the
state
system
would
be
effectively
torn
down
by
not
allowing
us
to
prohibit
those
forms
of
discrimination
which
have
proved
to
be
problematic
on
the
state
level,
but
have
not
yet
risen
to
the
level
of
a
national
problem.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
yes.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
we
think
the
congress
that
enacted
erisa
intended
that
in
the
area
of
employment
discrimination
that
the
principles
enunciated
in
title
vii
control
and--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--it
is
predicated
on
514(d)
and
on
the
specific
legislative
history
where--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--that
the
preemption
provision
may
not
be
construed
so
as
to
any
way
alter--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--a
federal
law.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
title
vii.
and
we
say
that
to
preempt
the
human
rights
law
would
alter,
indeed,
in
many
cases,
impair
the
title
vii
scheme
that
congress
envisioned
in
1964
when
it
enacted
title
vii,
repeated
in
'72
when
it
amended
title
vii
and
repeated
again
in
'78.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
no,
some
states
don't.
most
states--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--title
vii
was
formulated
on
the
assumption
that
the
states
would
take
pain
to
eradicate
employment
discrimination
at
the
local
level.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
no.
but,
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that,
that
congress
hoped
and,
indeed,
set
up
a
system
to
encourage
states
to
enter
the
field
and
that
is
why
it
required
the
60-day
deferral,
the
deferral
to
state
agencies
to
eradicate
this
form
of
discrimination;
to
apply
state
law
in
its
entirety,
state
rules
of
evidence,
state
rules
of
damages,
would
all
apply,
not
simply
for
states
to
apply
federal
law,
but
for
states
to
apply
state
law
and
to
get
a
handle
on
the
types
of
pernicious
employment
discrimination
that
congress
recognized
in
'64
and
that
the
states
recognized
in
the
years
to
come.
as
i
see
that
my
time
is
running
short,
i
would
like
to
briefly
address
the
problem
of
erisa
preemption
of
the
new
york
state
disability
benefits
law,
because
if
the
second
circuit's
decision
is
affirmed,
new
york
will
be
unable
to
apply
its
disability
benefits
law
to
any
employer
unless
that
employer
happens
to
maintain
disability
benefits
in
a
separate
administrative
unit.
this
decision
will
wreak
havoc--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--new
york
could
do
that,
however,
that
was
not
what
congress
intended.
when
congress
enacted
erisa
and
its
predecessor
statute,
the
welfare
pension
plan
and
disclosure
act,
congress
was
aware
of
new
york's
law
and
was
aware--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--we
would
say
that
that
language
has
to
be
read
to
mean
any
plan,
fund,
or
program.
the
definition
of
plan
includes
all
three.
so,
any
program
required
to
be
maintained
by
state
law.
the
term
"solely"
means
only
that
to
the
extent
the
employer
provides
benefits
beyond
what
is
required
by
state
law.
in
that
respect,
the
employer
would
be
governed
by
erisa.
now,
i
am
aware
that
that
is
not
the
most--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--it
certainly
is
not
a
literal
reading
of
the
language.
but,
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
really
the
only
interpretation
that
gives
effect
to
what
congress
intended
which
was
to
preserve--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--yes.
i
understand
that
the
starting
point
must
be
the
language,
but
this
court
has
never
hesitated
to
look
beyond
the
language
when
to
focus
solely
on
the
language
would
lead
to
absurd
results.
and,
i
think
that
is
demonstrated
by
the
literal
reading
suggested
by
the
airlines
here
which
is
to
focus
on
the
purpose
for
which
the
employer
is
providing
disability
benefits.
the
airlines
suggest
that
that
purpose
can
be
gleaned
from
the
type
of
benefits
provided
and
if
employers
provide
benefits
beyond
what
is
required
by
state
law,
then
the
employer
is
not
maintaining
a
plan
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
state
law.
if
we
follow
that
out,
an
employer
who
maintains
less
benefits
than
is
required
by
state
law
or
no
disability
benefits
at
all,
is
also
not
maintaining
a
plan
solely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
state
law,
because,
indeed,
that
employer
is
not
complying
with
state
law.
so,
what
you
have
is
preemption
determined
by
the
employer's
good
will,
economic
judgment,
and--
ms.
deborah
bachrach
--the
solicitor
general's
theory
is
really
not
very
different
than
new
york
state's.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
yes.
and,
it
is,
for
all
practical
purposes,
essentially
what
we
have
argued
all
along;
that
new
york's
disability
benefits
law,
like
the
workers'
compensation
law
of
48
states,
must
remain
in
effect.
that
is
what
congress
intended.
and
that
we
can
continue
to
apply
our
law
as
written
and
to
require
the
mandatory
benefits
to
protect
workers
in
the
state.
i
would
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
deborah
bachrach
briefly,
your
honor.
the
appellees
argue
that
the
human
rights
law
is
preempted
in
its
entirety
to
the
extent
it
seeks
to
prohibit
discrimination
in
employee
benefit
plans
and
that
that
would
not
impair
title
vii
because
title
vii
envisioned
a
joint
enforcement
scheme
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
only
to
enforce
federal
law,
but
that
simply
is
not
correct.
the
deferral
provisions
of
title
vii
were
for
the
state
agencies,
the
state
fair
employment
agencies,
to
apply
state
laws
in
their
entirety
so
that
if
a
complaint
of
race
discrimination
in
a
medical
plan
was
first
filed
with
eeoc,
the
eeoc
would
defer
immediately
to
the
state
agency
to
allow
the
state
to
apply
its
law
in
its
entirety
without
any
preliminary
determination
of
whether,
in
fact,
the
state
law
might
provide
greater
protection
under
the
rubic
of
race
discrimination
than
would
federal
law.
title
vii
envisioned
state
enforcement
of
state
law
in
the
area
of
employment
discrimination.
thank
you.
