hear
arguments
next
in
the
case
of
george
c.

and
others
against
vernon
wallace
and
others.
mr.
mcgrath,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
a
claim
was
brought
by
someone
in
the
military,
marine
corps,
for
example,
and
said
that
the
training
course
was
excessively
harsh
and
violent
and
they
suffered
injury,
where
would
that
kind
of
claim
stand
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
bear
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
murcko.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
high
up
does
this
go?
do
they
sue
the
chief
of
naval
operations,
on
the
theory
that
he
is
the
last
word,
or
perhaps
the
secretary
of
the
navy
for
not
having
the
right
kind
of
officers
on
the
ship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
had...
what
if
they
had
taken
their
complaint
to
the
admiral
of
the
fleet
and
the
admiral
had
brushed
it
off
and
said
these
are
military
command
matters.
is
he
subject
to
suit,
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
an
allegation
was
that
the
admiral
tolerated
this
conduct?
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
trying...
mine
is
just
after
the
event,
the
allegation
is
that
these
matters
were
brought
to
his
attention
and
he
did
nothing
about
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
he
responded
by
pointing
to
the
provisions
of
the
code
of
military
justice
that
permits
the
enlisted
personnel
to
make
complaints
against
their
officers
and
said,
here
are
your
remedies?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there
are
other
remedies
for
military
personnel
within
the
structure
of
the
military,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
limit
this
sort
of
relief
to
peacetime,
or
would
you
carry
it
into
wartime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
discipline
breaks
down,
they
can
use
the
brig,
can't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
discipline
really
breaks
down,
they
can
use
the
brig
or
whatever
the
equivalent
is
on
board
ship.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it'll
encourage
suits
out
of
the
ninth
circuit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
ninth
circuit,
if
we
hadn't
taken
the
case,
do
you
suggest
this
would
have
no
impact
on
suits
by
military
personnel
against
their
officers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sherrier
against
rhodes
was
the
state
militia,
national
guard.
excuse
me,
i
thought
you
were
relating
those
two
things.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
recall
your
brief,
but
did
you
refer
to
any
cases
in
the
british
navy
or
the
british
army
prior
to
1776
where
suits
against
officers
of
the
british
were
sustained?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
mcgrath?
chief
justice
warren
e.
