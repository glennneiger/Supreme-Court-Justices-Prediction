mr.
john
murcko
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
may
please
the
court.
i
represent
five
black
sailors
who
are
here
because
they
were
intentionally
discriminated
against
by
their
commanding
officer
and
other
officers
aboard
the
u.s.s.
decatur
in
job
assignments,
in
promotions,
in
discharges,
as
well
as
in
advancement
in
ratings,
in
skilled
ratings,
in
schooling
for
skilled
ratings,
and
also
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
threatened
with
violence
and
also
subjected
to
various
actions
by
people
who
were
sympathetic
to
the
klan
aboard
the
ship,
and
no
action
was
taken
by
the
command.
before
i
get
into
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
briefly
relate
some
of
the
salient
facts
here,
which
we
think
are
particularly
urgent
and
that
show
the
discriminatory,
the
serious
discriminatory
action
by
the
command.
mr.
john
murcko
no,
we
think
it
only
applies
to
the
officers
that
were
involved
in
the
intentional
acts
of
discrimination
against
the
black
people
who
were
on
that
ship
and
which
deprived
them
of
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
murcko
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
it
would
only
apply
to
those
particular
individuals
that
were
practicing
the
racial
discrimination
and
wouldn't
go
further
than
those
particular
individuals.
mr.
john
murcko
well,
if
he
condoned
it
and
in
some
way
participated
in
it,
then
i
believe
that
he
would
definitely
be
responsible.
mr.
john
murcko
well,
the
thing
is
if
he
had
the
authority
and
the
responsibility
to
take
action
against
these
individuals
and
he
knew
that
the
commander
was
involved
in
intentional
racial
discrimination
and
he
failed
to
take
any
action,
then
i
believe
that
he
would
also
be
a
participant
and
would
be
responsible
for
the
discriminatory
acts
if
they
were
continuing
and
he
knew
that
they
were
continuing.
mr.
john
murcko
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
would
you
please
repeat
the
question?
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that
is
correct.
there
are
certain
remedies.
there
are
certain
remedies
that
are
available.
however,
we
think
that
those
remedies
essentially
are
not
adequate.
they
do
not
provide
the
type
of
relief
that
bivens
states
should
be
provided,
such
as
a
damage
remedy.
in
addition,
under
article
138,
an
individual
does
have
the
right
to
report
his
commanding
officer.
however,
we
believe
that
this
is
a
very
informal
remedy
and
what
occurs
is
that
the
commanding
officer
calls
in
the
individuals
responsible,
another
officer,
another
person,
and
they
informally
discuss
it,
informally
discuss
it.
there's
no
right
to
a
hearing,
there's
no
right
to
subpoena
witnesses,
there's
no
right
to
present
evidence,
it's
just
an
informal
remedy,
essentially,
that
is
ineffective.
in
fact,
numerous
federal
courts
have
held
that
these
remedies,
so-called
military
remedies,
are
ineffective
and
are
futile
for
servicemen
to
pursue
because
essentially
the
military
has
not
had
a
history
of
supervising
and
essentially
eradicating
or
eliminating
the
problems
under
arcticle
138,
a
condition
in
this
case.
we
have
applied
to
the
board
for
the
correction
of
naval
records
and
in
one
case
they
denied
our
relief.
in
other
cases,
they
referred
us
to
the
chief
of
naval
personnel
and
we
still
haven't
gotten
any
effective
relief
from
the
chief
of
personnel,
even
though
we
sent
all
of
the
complaints
that
we
have--
mr.
john
murcko
--no,
there
was
one
appeal
in
this,
there
was
one
article--
mr.
john
murcko
--yes,
you
do
have
a
right,
it
isn't
automatic,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
murcko
there
was
only
one
article
50
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
john
murcko
--no,
there
was
only
one
article
50
and
that
was
regarding
lemons
and
the
fact
that
he
was
punished
for
one
infraction
of
leaving
his
clothes
when
another
person
was
not...
a
white
person
was
not
punished.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that's
correct.
he
could
have
appealed
it,
but
the
thing
is,
it
wasn't
a
question
of
that
particular
violation
there,
it
was
more
a
question
of
the
actions
that
were
taken
by
his
command
against
him
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
denied
any
right
to
take
the
examination
for
his
position--
mr.
john
murcko
--no,
no,
i
said
he
didn't
exercise
it,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
murcko
that's
correct,
sir.
so,
we
feel
that
seaman
wallace
here
had
been
intentionally
discriminated
against
by
commander
chappell,
by
lieutenant
commander
viafore
and
by
lieutenant
jordan
where
they
intentionally
kept
him
out
of
oi
division
after
he
had
been
approved
to
go
into
oi
division
by
the
personnel
development
board,
which
is
a
board
of
five
chiefs
who
make
a
determination
if
a
person
is
qualified.
the
five
chiefs
said
wallace
is
qualified.
in
addition,
his
division
officer
said
yes,
he
is
qualified.
he
should
be
in
the
operations
intelligence
section.
yet
commander
chappell,
as
well
as
lieutenant
jordan,
intentionally
kept
blacks
out
of
the
intelligence
division,
because
they
felt
that
they
could
not
trust
black
people
there,
because
they
did
not
want
blacks
in
positions
of
authority
and
responsibility.
and
so,
as
a
result
of
that,
they
transferred
him
out,
they
transferred
wallace
out
into
the
area
of
the
deck
division.
and
essentially,
he
was
required
there
to
chip
paint
as
well
as
to
swab
the
decks,
which
is
the
traditional
role
of
black
people
in
the
navy.
historically
they
have
been
kept
either
as
stewards
or
as
people
who
worked
in
decks
and
unskilled
jobs.
in
addition,
he
had
been
threatened,
wallace
had
been
threatened
by
his
division
officer
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
be
transferred
out
because
of
the
fact
that
he
was
speaking
up
about
the
treatment
of
blacks
on
that
ship.
also,
wallace
had
been
subject
to
the
actions
of
klan
sympathizers
on
the
ship.
some
sympathizer
hung
a
noose
in
his
work
space.
the
noose
has
been
the
symbol
of
lynching
of
blacks
for
a
long
time.
this
caused
great
consternation
for
seaman
wallace,
put
him
in
great
fear
and
caused
him
great
humiliation.
this
was
done
in
the
presence
of
lieutenant
jordan,
as
well
as
chief
parks.
they
knew
that
it
was
there,
yet
they
didn't
order
it
down.
they
did
not
bring
the
responsible
people
to
task.
and
wallace
complained
to
them
and
they
did
nothing
about
it.
in
addition,
there
was
numerous
graffiti
in
the
work
spaces
that
the
klan
put,
including
kkk>
["].
this
was
reported
to
lieutenant
jordan,
to
commander
chappell.
they
took
no
action
to
clean
up,
to
clean
it
up
or
to
get
the
responsible
people.
and
the
respondents
were
involved
in
trying
to
essentially
clean
up
the
ship
in
that
sense.
ensign
shannon
also
was
discriminated
against.
he
had
been
threatened
by
lieutenant
bianco,
to
be
killed
by
lieutenant
bianco
because
he
left
a
door
open.
and
also,
he
was
given
a
low
evaluation
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
complaining
about
the
treatment
of
blacks
on
the
ship.
after
the
suit
was
filed,
there
were
more
threats
by
these
officers.
hickey
was
threatened
to
be
sent
to
deck
division
because
of
the
fact
that
he
filed
the
suit
and
the
others
were
essentially
required
to
be
in
dangerous
conditions,
including
lemmons
and
richardson,
because
of
the
fact
that
they
filed
the
suit.
moving
on
to
the
argument,
we
think
that
first,
it
appears
that
the
government,
in
their
reply
brief,
concedes
that
in
cases
involving
unconstitutional
conduct
by
officers
are
reviewable
in
federal
court
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
and
that's
on
page
two
and
footnote
two.
so
we
think,
in
this
case,
that
essentially
they
accede
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
court
over
these
issues.
in
addition,
we
feel
that
they
accede
the
question
of
justiciability.
so
the
sole
question
here,
we
feel
at
this
time,
is
the
question
of
damage
remedies
and
we
feel
essentially
that,
in
this
particular
case,
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
black
sailors
should
be
treated
the
same
as
any
other
litigants
in
federal
courts
and
they
are
entitled
to
damage
remedy
for
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
murcko
no,
we
just
limit
it
to
peacetime,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
think
that
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
and
we
stand
behind
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
100
percent.
we
think
that
the
damage
remedy
is
the
narrowest
form
of
remedy
in
the
courts
and
we
feel
that
the
injunctive
relief
that
the
government
said
it
doesn't
oppose
is
much
more
intrusive.
it's
much
more
intrusive
into
the
military
because
of
the
fact
that
it
orders
the
military--
mr.
john
murcko
--that
is
correct.
they
may
oppose
it
in
this
case,
your
honor,
but
as
a
general
rule,
they
said
they're
not
opposing
the
fact
that
a
service
personnel
does
have
the
right
to
go
to
court
and
seek
an
injunction
against
his
superiors
who
are
violating
his
constitutional
right
and
that's
in
writing,
your
honor.
and
so
we
feel
essentially
that
it's
much
more
intrusive,
this
injunction
is
much
more
intrusive
than
any
damage
remedy.
mr.
john
murcko
well,
the
ship
would
probably
have
to
go
to
timbuktu.
i
think
that
that
would
take
a
priority.
mr.
john
murcko
don't
doubt
it
for
one
minute.
mr.
john
murcko
they
have
to
wait
until
they
get
back,
unless
they
transferred
some
of
the
people
off
the
ship,
which
happens
in
many
cases
when
you--
mr.
john
murcko
--pardon?
mr.
john
murcko
no,
the
commander
would
go.
the
commander
would
go.
the
commander
would
go
with
his
ship.
that's
his
obligation,
but
the
people
would--
mr.
john
murcko
--no,
that's
correct.
we
could
not
stop
him,
his
duties
and
obligations
are
to
national
security.
mr.
john
murcko
well,
your
honor,
we
can
just
continue
the
case.
other
cases
are
continued.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that
is
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
i
do
urge
you
to
move
cautiously
here,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
and
in
addition,
we
feel
that
the
government
also
apparently
concedes
that
there
is
still
racial
discrimination
in
the
naval
when
it
states
that
on
page
nine,
footnote
8
of
their
brief,
that
the
u.s.
military
is
making
headway
against
racism.
they
recognize
that
racism
is
a
problem
in
the
military
and
we
feel
that
essentially
there
must
be,
these
individuals
must
have
the
right
to
vindicate
their
rights
to
be
free
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
navy.
we
think
that
an
important
point
that
the
government
makes
essentially
is
that
whether
congress
has
enacted
a
gold
remedy
for
servicemen.
essentially,
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
state
bivens
on
its
head.
because
bivens
states
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
the
constitution
for
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
unless
there
are
special
factors
counseling
hesitation
in
the
absence
of
a
remedy
by
congress.
and
we
think
that
essentially
the
remedy
exists
under
bivens
for
these
black
servicemen,
but
the
government
essentially
is
trying
to
deprive
these
black
sailors
of
the
right
under
bivens
by
saying
that
congress
never,
congress
never
provided
a
remedy.
well,
the
remedy
is
there.
congress
never
provided
an
alternative,
specific
remedy
and
the
thing
is,
we
don't
think
that
that's
required.
but
even
more,
we
feel
that
congress
has
spoken
in
this
area.
in
1976,
it
issued
a
statute,
10
usc
1089,
which
essentially
gave
absolute
immunity
to
military
medical
personnel
for
any
acts
that
they
perform
in
the
military
and
only
makes
the
government
responsible
for
their
acts.
well,
at
that
time,
congress
recognized
that
officers
of
the
military
are
subject
to
liability,
otherwise
they
would
not
have
had
to
pass
this
statute.
and
we
feel
that
by
doing
so,
if
it
intended
to
preclude
liability,
it
would
have
included
all
officers
in
there.
it
would
have
made
all
officers
absolutely
liable.
but
it
did
not
do
so.
it
just
said
medical
personnel
are
not
liable.
and
by
doing
so,
we
think
they
recognized
the
authority
of
dinsman
v.
wilkes
and
wilkes
v.
dinsman
which
holds
that
a
superior
officer
is
responsible
for
the
violation
of
the
rights
of
people
under
his
command.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
murcko
well,
the
thing
is,
congress
could
say
that
but
then
there'd
be
a
different
issue,
justice
white.
then
we'd
have
to
make
a
determination
whether
a
statutory
exemption
or
immunity
would
take
precedence
over
a
constitutional
right.
that
is
another
case.
that
is
not
this
case,
justice
white.
we
feel
that--
mr.
john
murcko
--well,
the
thing
is--
mr.
john
murcko
--well,
we
think
this
court
in
carlson
v.
green
stated
that
the
remedy
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
not
adequate
for
prisoners
because
it
does
not
provide
the
type
of
relief
that
the
constitution
requires
and
that
these
other
relief
that
have
been
passed
by
congress
was
not
adequate
in
vindicating
the
constitutional
rights.
mr.
john
murcko
no,
that's
correct.
no,
the
thing
is
i'm
not
saying
that
congress
can't
provide
a
remedy,
i'm
talking
about
whether
congress
provides
an
immunity--
mr.
john
murcko
--that
is
correct.
in
addition,
we
think
another
important
question
here
is
the
question
of
immunity,
whether
military
officers
are
entitled
to
qualified
or
absolute
immunity.
and
we
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
main
argument
of
the
government
here
is
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
a
breakdown
in
discipline
caused
by
these
particular
types
of
actions.
we
think
that
when
there's
racial
discrimination
involved,
that
the
discipline
has,
the
special
relationship
between
a
sailor
and
his
commissioned
officer
as
well
as
the
discipline,
has
already
broken
down.
it
has
broken
down
by
the
intentional
discrimination
and
we
feel
that
essentially
the
disciplinary
effect
on
a
sailor
is
that
the
damage
action
presupposes
an
obeyance
of
the
orders,
otherwise--
mr.
john
murcko
--excuse
me.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
discipline
doesn't
just
mean
punishment.
discipline
means
also
affecting
the
relationship
as
far
as
people's
attitude
toward
number
one,
the
enlisted
person
has
toward
his
officer
and
number
two,
the
attitude
that
the
officer
has
toward
the
enlisted.
and
we
feel
essentially
that
the
there
must
that
special
relationship
must
be
kept
intact
and
we
say
that
it's
affected
by
the
intentional
discrimination,
long
before
the
suit
is
brought,
the
intentional
discrimination
destroys
that
special
relationship
which
we
think
is
so
important
to
the
national
security
of
our
country.
and
we
think
that
by
the
time
the
suit
is
brought,
it
does
not
affect
the
discipline
because
essentially
what
this
individual
is
trying
to
do
is
vindicate
his
rights
and
try
to
put
a
stop
to
the
intentional
discrimination
action
caused
by
his
superior
which,
in
effect,
is
causing
harm
to
the
military.
mr.
john
murcko
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
encourage
suits
any
more
than
it
would
now,
because
of
the
fact
that--
mr.
john
murcko
--well,
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
have
no
impact
at
all,
but
i'm
saying
that
essentially
there's
an
economic
question
here.
number
one,
there's
a
question
here
of
whether
servicemen
can
afford
to
retain
attorneys
to
bring
suit
on
their
behalf
because
of
the
fact
that
they
make
such
a
low
amount
of
pay.
second,
they
don't
qualify
for
legal
services
under
the
indigency
program
because
of
the
fact
that
they
make
over
$300
a
month.
and
in
addition,
the
fact
is
many
attorneys
will
not
take
these
type
of
case
when
they
know
there
is
no
great
remuneration
involved
for
it.
so
we
don't
believe
that
there's
going
to
be
any
flooding
of
the
gates
for
these
type
of
suits.
and
in
addition,
the
government
only
points
to
approximately
10
suits
in
their
brief
when
there
are
over
two
million
service
personnel.
mr.
john
murcko
well,
if
we
win,
your
honor,
justice
white--
mr.
john
murcko
--that's
correct.
if
we
win
here
and
then
essentially
we'd
go
back
and
all
we're
entitled
to
is
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
mindes
entitles
us
to
a
trial.
so
we've
been
waiting
five
years
for
a
trial,
justice
white,
and
we
haven't
gotten
any
step
closer,
any
closer
to
that.
we
think
essentially
that
the
primary
question
here
is
the
question
of
immunity.
and
we
think
that
the
qualified
immunity
is
the
norm
under
the
harlow
v.
fitzgerald
case.
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
type
of
immunity
that
military
officers
are
entitled
to.
we
think
that
that
gives
naval
officers
adequate
protection
against
suits
by
their
inferiors.
we
think
that
essentially
only
recognized
constitutional
claims
can
be
brought.
in
addition,
we
think
that
any
frivolous
suits
can
be
dismissed
under
a
motion
for
summary
judment.
in
addition,
we
feel
that
there
the
arguments
by
the
government
that
there
is
essentially
an
absolute
immunity
here
has
no
basis
in
the
common
law.
the
common
law
provides
essentially,
as
the
dinsman
case
holds,
that
military
officers
do
not
have
absolute
immunity.
this
court
in
dinsman
v.
wilkes
and
wilkes
v.
dinsman
held
that
military
officers
do
not
have
absolute
immunity.
they
only
have
qualified
immunity.
mr.
john
murcko
i
believe
that
was
the
u.s.
navy,
your
honor.
mr.
john
murcko
no,
i
said
dinsman
v.
wilkes.
dinsman
v.
wilkes.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that's
right.
that's
correct.
but
dinsman
v.
wilkes
says
that
naval
officers,
united
states
navy,
are
answerable
for
common
law
torts
when
they
are
intentional
and
malicious,
so
there
is
no
common
law
basis
for
this
absolute
immunity
the
government
is
asking.
in
addition,
the
judicial
immunity
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
well
as
the
prosecutorial
immunity
is
also
a
rule
in
the
common
law.
but
nowhere
the
common
law
does
it
say
that
military
officers
are
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
so
we
move
on
to
the
constitutional
area.
does
the
constitution
provide
absolute
immunity
for
the
military?
no,
it
does
not.
the
only
area
where
it
provides
constitutional
immunity
are
legislative
functions
and
presidential
functions.
mr.
john
murcko
yes,
that's
correct.
we
do
cite
numerous
cases
from
the
common
law
of
england
which
allowed
suits
against
the
officers
there
for
intentional
violation
of
their
inferior's
rights.
and
damage
actions
were
upheld.
so
there's
a
long
tradition
in
the
common
law
which
allows
a
military
person
to
sue
a
superior
for
intentional
violation
of
his
rights.
so
we
feel,
in
concluding,
essentially
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
should
be
affirmed
and
the
defendant's
right
to
a
bivens
action
should
be
allowed
to
proceed.
thank
you.
