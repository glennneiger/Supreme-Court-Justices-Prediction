justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
would
go
for
the
fifth
circuit
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
you
don't
think
lends
any
support
for
this--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
mean
against
damages
or
injunctions?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
injunctions?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
can't
get
an
injunction
here,
it
wouldn't
be
because
of
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
prayer
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
is
that
a
bivens
cause
of
action
just
shouldn't
lie
in
this
context
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
for
damages
or
for
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
would
all
of
the
personnel
actions
involved
here
have
been
subject
to
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
said
they
oppose
it
in
this
case,
not
because
of
immunity,
but
because
of
other
considerations.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
then,
you
wouldn't
you
would
say
congress
could
say,
in
providing
remedies
before
the
corrections
board
of
corrections,
for
example,
that
this
remedy
shall
be
exclusive.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
actually
said
it
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
if
they
said
it,
it
wouldn't
change
the
situation
much
if
it
was
a
lot
a
pretty
poor
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
think
what
if
we
happened
to
disagree
with
you
and
thought
that
the
provision
of
these
other
remedies
for
some
or
all
of
these
acts
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
at
least
it
presents
the
sort
of
a
situation
where
you
should
not
imply
bivens
remedy.
what
if
we
thought
that
and
disagreed
with
you,
then
do
we
have
to
reach
some
constitutional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
didn't
suggest
that
congress
couldn't
have
provided
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
bivens
remedy
in
the
carlson
against
green
situation,
did
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
provide
a
remedy
and
they
can
also
make
it
exclusive.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
win,
what
will
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
win
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
state
military
officers
or
federals
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you
say
sherrier
against
rhodes?
