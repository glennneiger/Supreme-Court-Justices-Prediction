well,
butz
also
distinguished,
didn't
it,
immunity,
absolute
immunity,
from
suit
for
common
law
torts,
as
compared
to
constitutional
violations
where
it
indicated
qualified
immunity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
we're
dealing
with
alleged
constitutional
torts
or
violations
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
the
wilkes
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
plaintiffs
here
could
ask
for
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcgrath,
i
guess
the
plaintiffs
also
filed
under
section
1985(3).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
briefs
don't
deal
with
that
very
extensively.
how
do
you
address
that
problem?
the
briefs
do
not
deal
with
that
very
extensively,
nor
did
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
believe
that
probably
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
in
a
number
of
this
court's
decisions
in
deciding
whether
damage
actions
should
be
implied
under
1983
or
1985,
on
the
one
hand,
or
under
the
constitution,
in
the
case
of
federal
officials,
on
the
other,
this
court
has
over
and
over
again
stated
that
generally
the
same
considerations
apply
in
either
case.
does
section
1985(3)
reach
actions
by
federal
officials?
