how
about
appeals
from
captains
masts?
they're
not
automatic,
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
you
had
that
right
to
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
a
right
to
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
could
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
said
several
captains
masts,
i
read
in
the
appendix.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
could
have
appealed
that,
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
wasn't
denied
the
right
to
appeal.
i'm
just,
it
doesn't
hurt
the
case
to
admit
one
of
them
was
a
good
one,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
we
don't
have
to
go
all
the
way
with
you,
do
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
ask
you
just
a
simple
question.
you
set
this
case
for
trial
on
july
8
and
on
july
7
this
ship
gets
orders
to
go
to
timbuktu.
what
would
happen?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
doubt
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
to
the
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
the
commander
of
the
ship?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
commander
going
to
depart?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't
stop
him
from
going,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
can't
you
see
a
whole
lot
of
problems?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
go
back
to
what
this
court
said
in
bivens,
that
you
ought
to
move
very
cautiously.
didn't
this
court
say
that
in
bivens.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
don't
you
urge
us
to
move
very
cautiously
here?
