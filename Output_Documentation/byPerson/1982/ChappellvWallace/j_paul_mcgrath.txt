mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
but
one
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
military
personnel
may
be
permitted
to
maintain
a
damage
action
against
their
superiors
for
alleged
constitutional
torts.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
they
may,
at
least
under
certain
circumstances,
and
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
that
ruling.
the
respondents
were
five
black
enlisted
men
who
were
serving
aboard
the
guided
missile
destroyer,
u.s.s.
decatur.
they
sued
their
superiors
from
the
chief
petty
officers
immediately
above
them
on
up
to
the
commander
of
the
ship
and
charged
that
actions
taken
by
those
superior
officers
were
racially
motivated
and
therefore
that
the
equal
protection
rights
of
the
respondents
were
violated.
the
actions
in
question
were
actions
taken
in
the
ordinary
course
of
military
command.
they
involved
assignments
to
particular
parts
of
the
ship
or
to
particular
duties.
they
involved
performance
evaluations.
they
involved
minor
punishments
for
actions
taken
aboard
the
ship.
and
they
involved
scoldings,
or
in
the
words
of
the
record
below,
being
chewed
out
by
their
superior
officers.
the
district
court
dismissed,
on
the
motion
of
the
defendants,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
in
doing
so,
the
court
recognized
that
permitting
an
action
such
as
this
to
be
maintained
had
serious
drawbacks.
the
court
agreed
that
the
mere
maintenance
of
such
an
action
can
be
disruptive
of
military
discipline.
and
the
court
also
expressly
recognized
that
permitting
a
civilian
court
at
the
beginning
of
such
a
process
to
review
the
internal
disciplinary
mechanisms
of
the
service...
of
the
military
services
could
usurp
military
functions.
but
nevertheless
the
court
held
that
a
constitutional
damage
action
could
be
maintained
and
that
the
superior
officers
were
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
and
then
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
consider
whether
this
particular
case
could
continue
in
light
of
a
four-part
test
which
the
court
promulgated.
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
if
allowed
to
stand,
means
at
least
two
things.
first
it
means
that
every
military
commander
is
subject
to
damage
suits
by
his
or
her
subordinate
for
any
command
decision
taken
with
respect
to
them.
and
secondly,
the
decision
below
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
whole
approach
this
court
has
taken
to
intra-military
suits.
and
it
is
extremely
troublesome
in
its
impact.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
no,
mr.
justice
white,
the
fifth
circuit
case
was
a
judicial
review
of
the
intra-military
process
and
it
is
clear
that
in
certain
circumstances
the
review
process
within
the
military--
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
--it
lends
no
support
whatsoever.
we
urge
two
bases
for
reversal
here.
first,
under
the
bivens
case
and
the
cases
following
bivens,
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
no
constitutional
damage
action
will
be
implied
if
special
factors
counsel
hesitation.
well
in
this
case,
the
special
nature
of
the
military
command
structure,
as
framed
by
congress,
and
its
operation,
are
the
special
factors
which
counsel
hesitation
in
implying
a
bivens
remedy.
and
secondly,
under
the
butz
decision,
this
court
has
held,
and
in
cases
following
butz,
this
court
has
held
that
there
should
be
absolute
immunity
afforded
to
governmental
officials
if
those
officials
have
special
functions.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
against
damages.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
not
against
injunctions.
injunctions
could
still
rest.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
if
the
special
functions
of
the
individual
could
not
be
effectively
carried
out
without
absolute
immunity.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
yes.
in
the
butz
case,
they
were
distinguishing
barr
against
matteo
which
had
held
at
least
if
a
federal
officer
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
the
office,
they
were
generally
absolutely
immune
from
nonconstitutional
torts
and
held
that
in
the
constitutional
area
the
situation
was
different
because
by
definition,
the
federal
official
was
acting
outside
of
any
authority
that
the
federal--
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
--yes.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
the
wilkes
case,
which
was
the
1851
decision
of
this
court
which
recognized
that,
at
least
at
that
time,
a
military
superior
could
be
sued
by
essentially...
for
essentially
assault
and
battery,
is
distinguished
on
several
grounds.
first
of
all,
that
case
did
not
deal
with
a
constitutional
tort.
the
question
whether
there
was
a
bivens
type
action,
whether
a
governmental
official
could
be
sued
for
a
constitutional
tort,
was
not
decided
by
this
court
until
1971
in
the
bivens
case
itself.
secondly,
the
wilkes
case,
to
the
extent
it
can
be
read
as
permitting
a
nonconstitutional
tort
action,
is
inconsistent
with
barr
against
matteo.
and
third,
that
case
really
arises
in
a
different
era.
it
arises
in
an
era
when
the
military
was
much
smaller,
did
not
have
the
elaborate
system
of
review
that
has
been
promulgated
by
the
congress
since
then.
it
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
in
feres
and
stencel
aero,
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief.
it
is
not,
in
our
view,
necessary
for
this
court
to
overrule
the
wilkes
against
dinsman
case
in
reversing
the
ninth
circuit,
because
it
did
not
deal
with
a
constitutional
tort.
but
we
feel
that
for
all
those
reasons
it
is
not
controlling.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
not
at
this
point.
for
instance,
under
the
mindes
case
and
others,
what
the
courts
have
held,
including
this
court,
is
that
the
intra-military
actions
are
ultimately
reviewable,
judicially
reviewable.
here
there
were
a
number
of
courses
of
action
that
were
open
to
the
respondents.
they
could
have
sought
action
from
the
board
of
corrections
of
naval
records.
they
could
have
sought
article
138
proceedings
against
their
superiors
and
they
could
have
sought
other
remedies
to
deal
with
the
particular
things
they
were
complaining
about.
at
the
end
of
those
processes,
had
they
availed
themselves
of
them,
and
had
the
carrying
out
of
those
processes
not
been
done
in
accordance
with
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
in
the
constitution,
there
would
have
been
ultimately
judicial
review
under
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
and
other
courts.
but
that
is
a
wholly
different
situation
from
the
one
we
have
here
where
before
taking
any
of
those
actions,
this
suit
was
filed
and,
as
the
record
shows,
as
the
joint
appendix
showed,
they
took
only
in
desultory
fashion,
one
or
two
half-hearted
steps
in
these
directions.
but,
in
any
event,
the
administrative
remedies
were
never
exhausted.
the--
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
--if
you
could
not
get
an
injunction
here,
it
would
not
be
because
of
immunity.
the
injunctive
part
of
the
case,
which
actually
was
not
really
focused
on
by
the
court--
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
--the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
would
be
separate,
that's
correct.
that
the
two
principle
bases
that
we
rely
on
for
saying
that
the
prayer
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
should
not
be
allowed
are,
first
of
all,
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
stated.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
it
should
not
lie
in
this
context
at
all.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
whether
for
damages
or
for
injunctive
relief,
but
we
do
not
rely
on
absolute
immunity
when
we're
discussing
the
equitable
question.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
that
case
would
not
lie.
in
the
feres
decision
of
this
court,
it
was
held
that
a
military...
military
personnel
could
not
sue
the
government
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
at
least
for
actions
taken
within
the
military
context.
and
that
decision
has
been
reaffirmed
a
number
of
times
since
then,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
i
think
that
decision
bears
here
in
this
sense.
in
the
feres
case,
this
court
recognized
that
the
tort
claims
act
was
broad
enough,
on
its
face,
to
permit
suits
by
military
personnel.
yet
the
court
viewed
the
fact
that
suits
by
military
personnel
for
command
decisions
would
have
a
particularly
disruptive
effect
on
military
discipline.
having
found
that,
the
court
refused
to
imply
that
military
personnel
could
sue
their
superiors,
could
sue
the
government
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
actions
by
their
superiors.
and
that,
we
think,
shows
that
this
court
has
paid
a
special
deference
to
congress
in
this
area
of
intra-military
disputes.
the
court
has
been
reluctant
to
add
remedies
onto
those
specifically
applied
by
congress
in
this
area
because
of
the
fact,
and
the
court
has
stated
it
over
and
over
again,
the
threat
of
disruption
of
military
discipline
is
so
great.
the
military,
after
all,
is
a
unique
institution
in
our
life.
it
is
the
only
institution
that
is
designed
to
be
prepared
to
send
men
into
combat.
this
court
has
recognized
over
and
over
again
that
that
single
fact
makes
the
military
command
function
and
military
discipline
an
overriding
concern
and
one
that
the
court
should
be
very
hesitant
to
disrupt.
the
particular
case
before
us,
i
think,
is
a
classic
example
of
why
the
court
should
refrain
from
fashioning
a
new
remedy
here.
the
plaintiffs
were
sailors
on
a
ship.
as
the
record
shows,
that
ship
was
about
to
embark
on
a
five-month
voyage
to
the
indian
ocean
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
iranian
crisis.
that
meant,
obviously,
these
men
would
be
in
very
close
contact
with
their
superiors
during,
perhaps,
very
hazardous
circumstances
for
a
long
period
of
time.
to
import
into
that
situation
the
added
artificial
disruptive
effect
of
an
ongoing
civilian
lawsuit
between
the
subordinates
and
their
superiors
could
not
possibly
have
anything
other
than
a
disruptive
effect.
and
it
is
for
that
reason,
the
very
fact
that
the
existence
of
the
lawsuit
can
disrupt
the
functioning
of
the
military
discipline
process
that
we
especially
urge
that
the
court's
decision
below
was
incorrect.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
they
did
file
under
1985(3),
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
well,
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
does
not
reach
actions
by
federal
officials
in
any
event.
there
has
been
no
decision
by
this
court
on
that
subject.
i
think,
however,
that
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
that
1871
civil
rights
statute,
you
will
not
find
anything
suggesting
it
was
designed
to
go
against
the
federal
government
or
federal
officials.
the
statute
talks,
on
its
face,
about
persons
in
territories
in
the
states
which
would
tend
to
suggest
it
wasn't
meant
to
so
imply,
so
apply,
but
there
is
really
no
definitive
holding
on
that
question.
what
we
would
say,
in
any
event,
is
that
the
court
really
does
not
have
to
reach
that
question,
that
under
cases
such
as
butz
and
carlson
against
green,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
a
bivens
case
would
not
properly
lie
because
it
should
not
be
implied
because
special
factors
do
counsel
hesitation,
that
that
same
reasoning
should
apply
to
1985(3).
both
because
of
that
and
also
because
under
feres
and
other
cases,
this
court
has
been
reluctant
to
imply
new
remedies
in
intra-military
suits.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
yes.
all
of
the
actions
here
would
have
been
subject
to
review.
for
example,
to
the
extent
that
there,
a
number
of
the
complaints
have
to
do
with
performance
evaluation
records.
those
are
all
subject
to
review
by
the
board
of
correction
of
naval
records.
a
number
of
the
actions
are
alleged,
just
bad
acts
by
commanding
officers.
those
are
all
subject
to
review
under
article
138
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
there
were
minor
punishments
involved.
for
instance,
one
of
the
actions
mentioned
in
the
papers
prominently
is
a
$50
fine
for
one
of
the
men's
having
left
his
clothes
out
in
the
work
space
just
before
an
inspection.
that
was
subject
to
the
informal
review
procedures
within
the
military.
in
short,
every
single
action
here
was
subject
to
review
under
those
provisions
and
also,
i
think,
perhaps
even
more
important,
under
the
naval,
navy's
equal
opportunity
program
and
its
regulations,
which
expressly
bar
discrimination
in
any
form
within
the
navy.
i
would
like
to
just
make
one
more
point.
the
number
of
times
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
intra-military
suits
it,
in
each
case,
has
pointed
to
the
fact
that
going
too
far
in
fashioning
new
remedies
would
have
an
intrusive
and
disruptive
effect
on
military
discipline.
and
in
each
case,
it
has
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
military
has
its
own
internal
system
of
justice,
which
has
been
fashioned
by
congress.
we
believe
those
decisions
make
total
sense.
they
make
complete
sense
in
this
case
where,
i
think,
everyone
agrees
that
the
implication
of
a
damage
remedy
would
have
the
greatest
personal
impact
on
the
military
command
process
and
therefore
we
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
be
affirmed...
be
reversed.
mr.
j.
paul
mcgrath
i
have
nothing
further,
mr.
chief
justice.
