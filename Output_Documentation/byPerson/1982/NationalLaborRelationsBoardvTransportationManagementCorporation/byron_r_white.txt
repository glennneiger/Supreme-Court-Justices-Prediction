in
that
respect,
does
the
board
call
it
its
wright-line
test?
is
it
the
wright-line
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
a
1980--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
when
was
the
earliest...
what
was
the
earliest
board's
case
that
articulated
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
it
changed
at
all
in
wright-line?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn't
need
any
help
if
it
was
so
clear
from
the
statutory
language
and
history,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
that
the
general
counsel
must
prove
a
discriminatory
motive
or
anti-union
bias?
how
much
of
one
does
he
have
to
prove?

a
motivating
factor.
justice
byron

the
employer
could
respond
certainly
in
two
different
ways.
one,
he
could
say,
i
am
going
to
meet
the
evidence
of
any
discriminatory
bias
or
any
anti-union
bias.
he
could
say,
perhaps
the
employer
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
and
raised
an
inference,
but
i
am
going
to
meet
that
inference.
i
am
going
to
put
up
enough
evidence
to
at
least
neutralize
that
evidence.
or,
he
could
say,
well,
even
if
there
is
an
inference
of
anti-union
bias,
i
would
have
fired
him
anyway.
and
it's
only
the
latter
that
the
board
claims
the
employer
has
the
burden
of
proving.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
could
come
forward
and
say,
i
didn't
do
it
at
all.
i
didn't
have
any
anti-union
bias.
somebody
just
lied.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
might
win
on
that
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
does
that,
the
general
counsel
still
has
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
wouldn't
be
a
defense.
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
it
just...
he
couldn't
possibly
claim
that
when
he
fired
him,
that
he
would
have
fired
him
for
another
reason,
because
the
reason...
he
didn't
even
know
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
an
administrative
law
judge
really
make
an
error
like
that,
if
things
had
been
so
clear
all
these
years?

was
to
clarify
what
hadn't
been
so
clear.
justice
byron

but...
i
take
it
the
board's
wright-line
test
in
this
very
case
would
not...
it
would
not
result
in
a
conclusion
by
the
board
that
there
had
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
employer
carries
his
burden.
justice
byron

and
you
wouldn't...
so
that
he
couldn't
be
posted
or
there
couldn't
be
a
cease
or
desist
order.
justice

under
the
afl-cio
position,
there
could
be
a
cease
and
desist
order--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
there
could
be
posting.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
board's
view
is
that
if
the
employer
carries
his
burden,
there
has
been
no
unfair
labor
practice.
