justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
you
decided
what
time
you
will
receive
questions
from
the
bench?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
does
the
board
actually
conduct
the
presentation
of
testimony
in
this
kind
of
segmented
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
help
the
board,
if
i
might
ask,
to
have
these
various
presumptions
and
burdens
of
persuasion?
wouldn't
it
be
just
as
easy
for
them
to
hear
from
one
side
and
then
hear
from
the
other
and
then
decide
the
factual
question?
well,
that
is
what
they...
what
they
really
do,
but
i
am
trying
to
specify
the
analysis
used
in
allocating
who
had
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
what
in
issuing
their
decisions,
in
analyzing
the
evidence
that
has
been
introduced.
well,
i
can
see
how
that
would
be
useful
if
the
board
directed
a
verdict
against
someone
saying
that,
you
know,
we
are
going
to
stop
the
proceeding
right
here
because
even
believing
your
evidence,
it's
not
enough
to
even
warrant
a
fact
finding,
but
in
proceedings
that
have
gone
to
completion,
and
the
board
has
heard
all
the
evidence,
how
does
this
rather
structured
and
somewhat
artificial
form
of
analysis
move
the
ball?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
the
employer
found
out
about
the
thievery
after
he
had
fired
the
guy.
now,
wouldn't
the
board
at
least
say
you
had
to
have
the
reason
as
of
the
time
you
fired
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
don't--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--don't
respondents
in
board
proceedings
do
the
same
thing
that
respondents
in
many
other
proceedings
do,
defend
on
the
ground,
a,
i
have
no
anti-union
bias,
b,
if
i
had
anti-union
bias,
it
wasn't
the
proximate
cause
of
the
discharge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
proof
in
this
case
go
before
the
board?
did
the
general
counsel
produce
witnesses
to
suggest
anti-union
animus
before
the
employer's
witnesses
testified?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
say
allege.
do
you
mean
testify
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
at
the
close
of
the
general
counsel's
presentation,
the
employer's
testimony
as
to
the
reason
for
discharge
was
in,
and
the
employee's
testimony
as
to
why
he
was
discharged.
