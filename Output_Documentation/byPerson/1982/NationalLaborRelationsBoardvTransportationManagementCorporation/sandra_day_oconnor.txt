justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
i
thought
there
had
been
some
suggestion
in
the
cases,
anyway,
that
what
the
general
counsel
has
to
prove
is
that
the
employee
would
not
have
been
fired
but
for
the
union
activity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
on
the
legislative
history,
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
would
read
it
and
come
to
a
conclusion
different
than
yours.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ames,
how
do
you
respond
to
the
legislative
history
argument
based
on
senator
ball's
statement
as
articulated
by
mr.
wallace?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
deal
with
senator
ball's
language
specifically?
