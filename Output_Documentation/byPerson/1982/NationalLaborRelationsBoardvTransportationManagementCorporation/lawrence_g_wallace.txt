mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
for
the
third
time
this
term
i
am
here
to
discuss
burdens
of
persuasion
and
burdens
of
production,
this
time
in
the
context
of
the
national
labor
relations
board's
allocation
of
burdens
of
proof
in
a
proceeding
under
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
act
charging
a
discharge
of
an
employee
for
anti-union
animus.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
proceed
with
my
argument
first
by
describing
briefly
but
comprehensively
the
overall
allocation
of
burdens
of
proof
in
such
a
proceeding
which
we
believe
to
be
correct
and
which
we
believe
to
be
a
fair
distillation
of
the
board's
decisions
and
practice.
i
do
this
because
we
believe
that
much
of
the
confusion
in
this
area
stems
from
incomplete
analysis
and
from
an
effort
to
force
all
categories
of
cases
into
an
analytical
framework
that
suits
only
some
categories
of
cases.
and
after
that,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
aspect
of
the
allocation
that
is
at
issue
here,
and
show
that
as
to
this,
the
board
faithfully
follows
the
congressional
intent,
and
that
its
practice
is
consistent
with
principles
reflected
in
this
court's
decisions,
and
then
show
that
these
principles
were
properly
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course,
i
am
just
explaining
why
i
am
not
starting
with
the
facts,
mr.
justice.
questions
from
the
bench
are
welcome
at
any
time.

[generallaughter.]
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
begin
with
in
such
a
proceeding
the
general
counsel,
of
course,
has
a
burden
of
production
and
a
burden
of
persuasion
to
show
that...
we'll
talk
about
discharges
here,
although
this
applies
to
any
8(a)(3)
case
and
to
many
8(a)(1)
cases
involving
other
adverse
action,
but
to
show
that
the
discharge
was
improperly
motivated,
that
anti-union
animus
generally
was
a
motivating
factor
in
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision.
if
he
establishes
that
with
his
evidence,
and
that
evidence
is
uncontroverted,
of
course,
he
has
established
his
case.
so
in
that
sense,
if
he...
if
his
evidence
establishes
that,
there
is
a
burden
of
production
on
the
employer
to
controvert
it
in
some
way,
and
the
usual
manner
of
controverting
it
is
to
show
that
there
was
a
legitimate
reason
or
reasons
for
the
discharge.
there
may
be
other
evidence
introduced
as
well
by
the
employer.
that
evidence
usually
serves
two
purposes,
the
evidence
of
a
legitimate
reason.
one,
to
rebut
the
evidence
that
there
was
an
improper
motivation,
or
two,
to
show
that
the
discharge
would
have
occurred
in
any
event
even
in
the
absence
of
the
improper
motivation.
occasionally,
that
evidence
is
introduced
for
only
the
latter
purpose.
there
are
cases,
and
we
have
cited
some,
in
which
the
employer
admits
that
an
improper
purpose
was
a
motivating
factor,
but
nonetheless
defends
on
the
ground
that
the
same
result
would
have
been
reached
in
any
event.
now,
if
what
the
employer
introduces
is
inherently
incredible,
or
insubstantial
on
its
face,
that
doesn't
really
change
the
case,
and
in
that
sense
his
burden
of
production
has
not
been
satisfied.
but
if
he
has
introduced
something
plausible,
as
was
the
case
here,
he
has
satisfied
that
burden
of
production,
and
then
the
burden
of
persuasion
remains
on
the
general
counsel
to
do
at
least
one
of
two
things.
one,
he
might
try
to
persuade
the
tribunal
that
the
proffered
legitimate
reasons,
and
i
use
"legitimate"
only
in
the
sense
of
non-prohibited,
not
a
value
judgment,
that
the
proffered
legitimate
reasons
were
not
in
fact
a
motivating
factor
at
all.
if
he
carries
that
burden
of
persuasion,
that
is
a
true
pretext
case,
and
he
has
shown
that
only
the
improper
motivation
was
present,
and
the
case
remains
what
it
was
before
that
evidence
was
introduced.
but
if
he
is
unable
to
do
that,
then
the
question
is
whether
in
light
of
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
employer,
the
general
counsel
can
still
satisfy
the
burden
of
persuasion
which
is
on
him
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
improper
reason
was
also
a
motivating
factor.
if
in
light
of
all
the
evidence,
including
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
employer,
the
general
counsel
still
succeeds
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
in
showing
that
anti-union
animus
was
a
motivating
factor,
then--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
not...
it
is
not
segmented
this
way.
we
are
segmenting
it
only
for
analytical
purposes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
arguable
that
the
ball
would
move
with
greater
ease
without
it,
but
this
is
what
the
board
has
been
doing
to
explain
its
decisions,
and
it
is
the
context
against
which
congress
legislated
in
taft-hartley
in
revising
the
law.
i
don't
think
what
they
did
on
this
subject
in
taft-hartley
can
be
understood
without
recognition
that
it
was
done
against
this
background,
and
it
is
the
background
against
which
the
courts
of
appeals
have
divided
in
their
views.
i
think
to
understand
what
has
occurred
in
this
field,
we
have
to
recognize
how
the
board
has
been
analyzing
these
cases,
even
if
it
might
have
been
possible
to
proceed
differently.
and
i
am
almost
at
the
end
of
this
overview.
i
was
saying,
if
the
general
counsel
was
unable
to
show
that
it
was
a
pretext,
the
clearest
way
of
doing
that
would
be
to
show
that
the
reason
didn't
exist
at
all
factually,
or
as
was
the
case
with
one
of
the
reasons
here,
that
the
employer
didn't
know
about
it
until
after
the
discharge
decision
was
made.
or
there
can
be
other
ways
of
showing
it
was
a
pretext,
such
as
by
showing
that
this
was
commonly
done
with
impunity
by
other
employees
to
the
knowledge
of
the
employer.
in
any
event,
if
he
doesn't
succeed
in
showing
that
it
was
a
pretext,
but
nonetheless
carries
his
burden
of
persuasion,
showing
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
anti-union
animus
was
also
a
motivating
factor,
then
we
have
a
true
dual
motive
case,
and
we
have
a
case
in
which
the
general
counsel
has
satisfied
his
burden
of
persuasion
that
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(3)
occurred
by
showing
that
the
adverse
action,
the
discharge
took
place
for
a
prohibited
reason,
because
from
the
beginning,
if
the
discharge
took
place
in
whole
or
in
part
for
a
prohibitive...
for
a
prohibited
reason,
that
was
sufficient
to
show
a
violation.
part
of
the
confusion
stems,
however,
from
the
fact
that
the
board
still
refers
to
this
showing
as
a
prima
facie
case,
and
the
reason
it
does
that
is
because
it
recognizes
the
possibility
of
the
employer
still
establishing
an
affirmative
defense,
by
showing
with
respect
to
a
hypothetical
question
that
the
discharge
would
have
occurred
for
the
legitimate
reasons
even
in
the
absence
of
the
improper
motivation
for
the
discharge.
and
on
that
question,
the
board
has
consistently
placed
the
burden
of
persuasion
as
well
as
of
production
on
the
employer,
and
the
board
has
referred
to
this
as
an
affirmative
defense,
and
the
issue
in
this
case,
the
difference
between
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
focuses
solely
on
this
phase
of
the
analysis.
now,
whether
it
is
proper
for
the
board
to
place
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
this
question
on
the
employer,
or
whether
the
burden
of
persuasion
must
remain
with
the
general
counsel
on
this
question,
and
this
is
a
matter
that
was
addressed
with
great
specificity
in
the
legislative
history
of
taft-hartley,
and
unlike
some
cases
in
which
the
board
appears
before
the
court,
where
we
are
contending
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
act
on
a
specific
matter
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
among
reasonable
alternatives,
and
therefore
should
be
sustained,
this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
an
interpretation
required
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
revision
of
the
act
in
taft-hartley.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
pertinent
materials.
it
was
well
established,
as
we
have
shown
in
cases
collected
starting
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
prior
to
taft-hartley,
that
if
the
discharge
was
motivated
in
whole
or
in
part
by
the
improper
motivation,
a
violation
had
been
shown,
and
that
the
burden
was
on
the
employer
to
prove
as
a
defense
that
he
would
have
reached
the
same
result
in
the
absence
of
the
improper
motivation.
many
board
opinions,
and
we
have
quoted
one
on
page
16,
referred
to
language
used
in
a
well
known
second
circuit
opinion,
nlrb
against
remington
rand,
which
is
cited
at
the
bottom
of
page
16
of
our
brief,
in
which
learned
hand
rejected
the
defense
factually,
although
he
said
it
was
a
proper
defense
for
the
employer
to
make,
in
language
that
was
quoted
and
requoted
many
times,
that
it
rested
upon
the
tort
feasor,
as
he
called
the
employer,
because
the
general
counsel
had
shown
that
he
had
acted
out
of
improper
motivation.
it
rested
upon
the
tort
feasor
to
disentangle
the
consequences
for
which
it
was
chargeable
from
those
for
which
it
was
immune.
and
that
interpretation
was
made
clear
in
annual
reports
to
congress
which
we
have
cited
in
footnote
9
on
page
18,
and
was
criticized
in
the
house
hearings
quite
specifically.
we
have
referred
to
that
also
in
footnote
9.
and
a
change
in
the
law
was
advocated,
and
indeed
the
house
bill
would
have
changed
the
law
specifically
in
that
respect,
and
on
page
18
of
our
brief
we
have
described
the
provision
that
was
in
the
house
bill
to
change
the
law
on
that
question.
that
provision
was
not
in
the
senate
bill,
and
the
conference
committee
struck
it
in
favor
of
retaining
the
existing
practice
before
the
board.
this
was
one
of
many
examples,
as
we
have
reminded
the
court
from
time
to
time,
in
which
the
strategy
of
the
conference
was
against
making
particular
changes
because
they
had
in
mind
larger
objectives
to
be
achieved
in
taft-hartley.
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
act
was
going
to
specify
categories
of
unfair
labor
practices
by
unions,
for
example.
they
wanted
to
overrule
this
court's
packard
decision,
which
had
included
foremen
within
bargaining
units,
and
they
knew
they
had
to
anticipate
a
veto
from
president
truman,
so
they
had
to
keep
together
a
broad-based
coalition
that
would
be
able
to
override
the
veto,
and
other
matters
were
not
being
changed
because
of
their
desire
to
accomplish
these
major
objectives.
and
senator
taft,
in
an
extended
interchange
on
the
floor
in
reporting
the
conference
bill,
and
we
have
quoted
pertinent
portions
of
it
on
page
20
of
our
brief,
an
extended
interchange
with
senator
pepper,
who
was
raising
this
problem
that
the
house
had
tried
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
away
from
the
employer
on
this
issue,
kept
pointing
out
repeatedly
that
this
was
struck
by
the
conference
committee
from
the
house
bill,
and
as
we
say
at
the
conclusion
of
the
excerpt
we
have
here,
under
provision
of
the
conference
report,
the
employer
has
to
make
the
proof.
this
is
the
present
rule
and
the
present
practice
of
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
the
wright-line
test
now.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
first
one
that
we
cite
is
dow
chemical
in
1939,
and
the
one
that
we
have
quoted
on
page
16
is
also
a
1939
case,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
don't
think
wright-line
meant
to
change
the
standard
at
all,
but
it
meant
to
articulate
it
with
the
help
of
this
court's
opinion
in
mt.
healthy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
wasn't
always
articulated
well
by
the
board,
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
until
wright-line,
in
the
cases
in
which
the
board
was
ruling
for
the
general
counsel
and
holding
that
the
employer
did
not
sustain
its
burden
of
proving
that
the
discharge
or
other
adverse
action
would
have
occurred
anyway,
the
board
tended
to
articulate
the
dual
motive
aspect
of
the
case.
but
when
the
board
was
ruling
for
the
employer
in
these
cases,
it
tended
not
to
articulate
that
it
was
a
dual
motive
case.
it
tended
just
to
say
that
the
general
counsel
did
not
sustain
his
burden,
often
saying
that
he
didn't
make
out
his
prima
facie
case,
which
caused
even
more
confusion.
it
was
hard
to
tell
in
those
cases
whether
the
board
really
thought
it
was
a
dual
motive
case
at
all.
we
have
collected
in
our
brief,
in
the
footnote
on
page
37,
footnote
25,
numerous
cases
in
which
the
board
has
sustained
the
employer
and
said
that
he
has
met
his
burden
of
proving
that
the
adverse
action
would
have
taken
place
anyway,
but
they
are
all
cases
from
1981
and
1982,
because
it
was
only
after
wright-line
specified
that
the
mt.
healthy
analysis
should
be
used
that
the
board
began
explicitly
in
ruling
for
the
employer
to
recognize
which
cases
were
dual
motivate
cases
where
the
employer
had
carried
that
burden.
i
think
wright-line
was
an
effort
to
articulate
the
standard
more
clearly,
and
to
bring
about
better
consistency
of
practice
from
case
to
case
before
the
board.
it
wasn't
meant
to
be
a
change
in
the
board's
rule
or
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
very
similar,
but
the
board
has
chosen
not
to
issue
a
remedy
at
all
in
cases
in
which
the
employer
has
sustained
the
burden.
the
board
would
do
what
the
afl-cio
is
advocating,
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order
in
a
hypothetical
case,
in
a
fairly
narrow
category
of
cases.
for
example,
in
our
own
case,
it
was
shown
that
one
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
employer,
that
he
had
left
his
keys
in
the
bus,
was
something
that
the
employer
did
not
know
until
after
the
discharge
had
taken
place.
it
was
a
pretext
in
that
sense.
if
that
had
been...
it
turned
out
that
in
this
case
that
was
something
commonly
done,
it
was
found.
it
would
not
have
justified
the
discharge
anyway.
but
if
that
had
been
a
more
substantial
infraction,
something
that
would
have
justified
a
discharge,
that
he
had
his
hand
in
the
till
or
something
of
that
sort,
and
yet
the
discharge
took
place
because
of
anti-union
animus
before
the
employer
knew
of
that,
the
board
would
find
a
violation,
and
issue
presumably
a
cease
and
desist
order,
but
would
not
order
reinstatement
in
a
situation
like
that,
because
an
affirmative
defense
in
the
sense
of
something
to
mitigate
the
remedy
had
been
shown.
but
they
treat
the
legitimate
reason
for
the
discharge
at
the
time
the
discharge
took
place
as
an
affirmative
defense
that
negates
a
violation.
they
probably
could
have
gone
either
way
on
this
question
consistently
with
the
legislative
history,
but
that
has
been
their
practice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
board.
the
board
could
have,
and
this
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
they
follow--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
course
it's
the
same,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
depends
on
the
evidence
of
what.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
that,
the
general
counsel
has
the
burden
of
proof,
and
he
must
satisfy
the
board
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
have
to
regard
judge
briar's
opinion
as
an
example
of
trying
to
fit
all
categories
of
cases
into
a
framework
that
is
suitable
only
for
some
categories,
and
not
recognizing
that
there
is
this
other
category
of
cases
where
the
general
counsel
has
persuaded
the
board
that
there
was
a
true
dual
motivation,
and
the
question
is
then
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
of
persuasion
on
the
question
of
whether
hypothetically
the
discharge
would
have
occurred
anyway.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
has
to
prove
that
it
was
a
motivating
factor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
motivating
factor,
as
this
court
used
that
term
in
arlington
heights
and
in
mt.
healthy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
by
and
large,
that
would
not
be
enough.
we
have
again
collected
a
number
of
cases
in
another
footnote
in
our
brief,
footnote
19
on
page
31,
to
show
that
speculation
or
suspicion
of
this
kind
has
not
been
enough
to
sustain
the
general
counsel's
burden
of
proof
before
the
board.
we
anticipated
that
this
question
would
come
up,
and
we
have
collected
pertinent
examples
there.
you
don't
always
have
to
have
a
smoking
gun
in
which
you
have
testimony
that
i
was
doing
it
to
get
even
with
him
for
the
union,
but
in
a
case
where
you
don't
have
to
have
a
smoking
gun,
the
circumstantial
evidence
has
to
be
pretty
strong
that
the
employer's
conduct
was
unchanged
from
what
it
had
been
for
years,
and
the
only
difference
is
his
union
activity,
and
others
were
doing
the
same
thing,
and
no
adverse
action
was
taken
against
them,
supported
by
testimony,
that
kind
of
thing.
you
can
prove
cases
by
circumstantial
evidence,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
the
way
that
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
expressed
a
disagreement
with
the
board
on
who
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
as
to
the
affirmative
defense.
they
articulate
the
burden
of
persuasion
being
on
the
general
counsel
to
negate
the
affirmative
defense
by
showing
that
but
for
the
improper
motivation,
the
discharge
would
not
have
taken
place,
and
that
is
precisely
the
issue
in
this
case,
and
the
matter
that
we
think
was
resolved
by
the
legislative
history,
and
the
other
thing
in
the
legislative--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
am
aware
of
that,
but
to
me
the
most
dispositive
thing
in
the
legislative
history
i
have
not
yet
gotten
to,
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court,
and
that
is
something
quoted
on
page
20
from
senator
ball,
right
beneath
the
quotation
that
we
have
of
senator
taft.
what
we
didn't
make
clear
in
the
brief
is
the
context
in
which
senator
ball's
remarks
were
made.
senator
taft's
remarks
were
made
in
reporting
what
the
conference
did
prior
to
the
vote
on
the
conference
report.
senator
ball
made
his
remarks
in
the
debate
on
whether
to
override
president
truman's
veto,
and
he
was
on
the
team
of
proponents,
and
senator
taft
yield
20
minutes
of
debate
time
for
the
proponents
to
senator
ball
for
the
purpose
of
rebutting
certain
specific
items
in
president
truman's
veto
message.
and
the
fifth
of
those
items
was,
as
the
president
said,
"the
bill
would
make
it
easier
for
an
employer
to
get
rid
of
employees
whom
he
wanted
to
discharge
because
they
exercised
their
right
of
self-organization
guaranteed
by
the
act.
"
and
senator
ball
said,
"mr.
president,
what
that
refers
to
is
an
explicit
provision
inserted
in
the
bill
in
conference
saying
that
if
the
employer
proves
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
board
that
he
discharged
an
employee
for
cause,
he
cannot
be
held
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
discharging
him.
"
that
is
exactly
the
rule
which
the
courts
now
require
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
follow.
it
would
be
hard
to
improve
upon
this
as
a
statement
of
burden
of
persuasion
that
would
be
meaningful
to
both
lawyers
and
non-lawyers,
and
this
is
not
impromptu
remarks
in
the
heat
of
debate.
this
is
obviously
a
carefully
prepared
statement
to
fulfill
an
assignment
on
behalf
of
the
proponents
of
the
override,
and
it
was
stated
just
before
the
legally
significant
vote,
the
vote
to
override
the
veto.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
believe
they
are,
but
that
is
debatable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
was
thin.
there
were
two
days
of
hearings
conducted
in
which
the
general
counsel
called
numerous
witnesses.
the
employer's
evidence
was
mostly
by
cross
examination
of
those
witnesses.
and
it
was
something
of
a
smoking
gun
case,
in
which
the
area
manager
was
quoted
as
saying
that
the
discharged
employee
was
"two-faced
for
joining
the
union,
and
i'll
get
even
with
him.
"
and
i
think
in
response
to
the
question
justice
stevens
asked
me
at
the
end,
that
the
findings
of
the
administrative
law
judge
would
certainly
be
more
than
adequate
to
dispose
of
this
case
properly,
and
we
quote
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
6,
in
the
first
footnote
paragraph
on
that
page,
we
quote
those
pertinent...
the
crucial
findings,
that
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
establishes
that
the
decision
to
discharge
him
was
motivated
by
a
desire
to
discourage
union
activities,
and
respondent
would
not
have
fired
him
but
for
his
union
activities.
now,
the
board
adopted
those
findings,
but
said,
as
clarified
herein,
and
what
the
board
apparently
was
concerned
about
was
that
the
administrative
law
judge
wrote
shortly
before
the
board's
wright-line
decision,
and
the
board
was
attempting
to
clarify
it
by
putting
it
in
terms
of
the
wright-line
decision,
and
they
may
well
have
been
worried
that
the
administrative
law
judge's
formulation
of
the
but
for
his
union
activities
might
have
meant
that
the
general
counsel
had
had
the
burden
of
persuasion
on
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
say,
part
of
the
mission
of
the
wright-line
decision
was
to
attempt
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
get
more
uniformity
of
application
of
what
the
rule
had
been
right
along
and
what
congress
had
approved
in
taft-hartley.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
that
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
that
would
go
to
remedy,
and
would
show
that
reinstatement
would
not
be
appropriate,
even
though
a
violation
had
occurred,
because
at
the
time
of
the
discharge
it
was
solely
for
improper
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
back
pay,
i
am
not
positive
what
the
board
would
do,
but
they
certainly
would
not
award
back
pay
for
more
than
the
one
day.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
was--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
to
prove
the
hypothetical
that
the
discharge
would
have
occurred
even
in
the
absence
of
the
improper
motivation,
just
as
it
was
in
mt.
healthy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
that
is...
that
is
where
it
applies.
that
is
a
dual
motive
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
the
thief
case,
the
discharge
took
place
before
they
knew
that
he
was
a
thief,
so
there
wasn't
a
dual
motive
for
the
discharge,
but
there
now
would
be
a
legitimate
reason
in
retrospect
for
the
discharge.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
if
you
could
show
that
it
would
have
been
a
sufficient
reason
in
itself,
and
would
have
produced
the
same
result.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
doubt
that
the
board
would
reinstate
him
at
all
in
that
situation,
but
they
would
probably
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order
telling
the
employer
to
cease
and
desist
for
taking
adverse
action
against
employees
because
of
their
union
activities,
as
they
did
in
this
case.
it
was
proven
that
they
did
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
board's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
then
that
is...
well,
there
is
a
practice
under
title
7
that
an
injunction
would
issue
even
though
the
same
result
would
have
been
reached
for
legitimate
reasons.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
final
footnote
of
this
court's
arlington
heights
opinion,
it
indicated
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
violation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
has
been
the
board's
view
and
practice.
