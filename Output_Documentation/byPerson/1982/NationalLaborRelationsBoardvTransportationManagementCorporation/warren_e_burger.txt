we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
transportation
management
corporation.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.

well,
at
least
they
are
received,
even
if
not
welcomed.

you
are
speaking
now
of
the
board
or
the
hearing
examiner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
the
hearing
examiner?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
enough
if
the
evidence
showed
that
the
employer
was
generally
hostile
to
having
a
union
organized?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ames.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
statement
that
justice
o'connor
has
just
referred
to
had
been
made
by
senator
taft
rather
than
another
senator,
would
that
give
you
more
trouble?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
concurring
opinion
has
about
the
same
status
as
a
concurring
opinion
in
a
multi-member
court.

no,
a
unanimous
decision
is
required
in
my
hypothetical.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes
remaining,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
clarify
something
at
least
for
my
own
reactions.
the
employer
discharges
for
union
activity,
and
after
he
has
given
the
notice
of
discharge
and
carried
it
out,
when
they
audit
the
man's
books,
they
find
that
he
has
embezzled
$25,000.
now,
what
do
they
do?
reinstate
him
for
having
been
fired
for
the
wrong
reason,
and
then
fire
him
for
the
right
reason?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
