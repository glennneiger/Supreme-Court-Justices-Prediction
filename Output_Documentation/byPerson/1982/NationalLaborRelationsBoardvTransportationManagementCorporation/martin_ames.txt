mr.
martin
ames
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
involves
the
proper
allocation
of
the
burden
of
proof
when
an
employer
is
charged
with
discriminatory
employment
conduct
in
violation
of
section
8(a)(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
will
determine...
i
will
discuss
with
you
this
morning
that
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
correctly
concluded
that
the
board
exceeded
its
statutory
authority
when
it
required
this
respondent
to
overcome
rather
than
to
neutralize
the
general
counsel's
prima
facie
case.
i
will
show
this
by
indicating
that
the
board
misapplied
the
role
of
a
prima
facie
case,
failed
to
adhere
to
the
statutory
mandate
of
sections
10(b)
and
10(c)
of
the
act,
and
failed
to
reconcile
with
the
teachings
of
this
court
what
it
considers
an
employment
discrimination
test
as
in
its
holding
in
wright-line.
mr.
martin
ames
i
think
the
legislative
history,
justice
o'connor,
is
not
ambiguous
on
the
issue
as
to
who
has
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof.
that,
i
think,
is
clear
in
the
history
of
the
statute.
i
think
where
the--
mr.
martin
ames
--i
believe
that
when
you
deal
with
senator
ball,
there
is
a
comment
that
is
contra
to
the
legislative
language
itself.
when
you
look
at
10(c),
which
is
intended
to
ensure
that
a
deserving
employee
can
seek
relief,
and
that
is
the
way
10(c)
is
structured,
and
you
read
it
in
conjunction
with
the
rules
of
evidence,
which
are
clearly
articulated
in
10(b),
which
we
see
in
rule
301
of
the
federal
rules,
and
made
applicable
to
the
board,
i
think
we
must
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
and
say
that
it
is
very
clear
on
its
face,
and
that
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof,
and
not
concerned
with
the
shifting
burden,
the
shifting
burden
that
rises
in
the
presumption
of
the
original
prima
facie
showing,
which
would
be
a
burden
of
production
that
devolves
upon
the
employer.
we
recognize
that
some
burden
devolves
upon
the
employer.
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
burden
of
persuasion.
we
believe
that
it
is
a
burden
of
production,
to
come
forward
as
a
prima
facie
case
would
normally
require
the
employer
to
come
forward,
to
give
a
reason
or
reasons
for
his
conduct.
should
he
not
do
that,
he
runs
the
risk,
the
risk
of
not
meeting
the
presumption
raised
by
the
prima
facie
case,
and
thereby
not
dispelling
the
inference
of
harboring
or
possessing
an
impermissible
discriminatory
motive.
mr.
martin
ames
senator
taft's
statements,
i
believe...
no,
it
would
not.
i
believe
senator
taft's
statements
in
the
debates
are
very
clear.
he
was
talking
about
ultimate
burden.
i
believe
he
was
talking
about
that
the
board
must
be
of
the
opinion,
based
upon
only
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
the
employer
either
acted
permissibly
or
otherwise,
that
the
nature
of
the
shifting
burden
was
never
really
addressed
by
congress
in
1947.
what
was
specifically
addressed
in
'47
was
a
bit
of
a
course
correction,
if
you
will.
congress
had
before
it
some
12
years
of
history
of
the
board's
conduct
under
the
act,
and
it
recognized
that
it
was
in
fact
practicing
an
in
part
test,
that
once
a
motivating
factor
was
shown,
notwithstanding
the
employer's
proferred
reason
for
his
conduct,
the
board
would
find
the
employer
having
harbored
some
discriminatory
motive
predicated
on
an
anti-union
purpose,
and
would
find
him
as
violating
section
8.
the
amendment
of
'47
corrected
that
course,
so
that
the
board
cannot
use
the
in
part
motive,
such
that
the
board
must
be
of
an
opinion
completely
based
upon
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that
compelled
the
general
counsel,
i
might
note,
not
to
be
a
lazy
participant.
if
you
follow
logically
what
the
board
has
done
in
its
wright-line
holding,
it
has
allowed
the
general
counsel
to
come
forward
with
a
prima
facie
case
based
upon
a
showing
of
motivation,
of
protected
union
activity,
some
knowledge
of
that
in
the
employer,
and
a
closeness
in
time,
if
you
will,
between
the
employer's
conduct
and
the
employer's
protected
activity.
that
establishes
a
prima
facie
case.
there
is
no
specific
authority
for
that,
but
that
is
the
way
it
operates
in
industrial
relations
cases
before
the
board.
the
board
recognizes
that.
in
its
own
wright-line
test,
in
its
own
holding,
it
says
general
counsel
shall
raise
the
inference.
the
employer
now
must
come
forward.
this
is
the
way
the
act
is
structured.
if
he
doesn't
come
forward,
he
loses,
because
there
is
nothing
before
the
trier
of
fact
to
suggest
to
rebut
a
presumption,
and
the
inference
raised
by
that
prima
facie
cases
is
not
vitiated,
and
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
find
that
it
was
more
likely
than
not
that
the
employer
acted
because
of
his
anti-union
animus.
mr.
martin
ames
justice
white,
i
think
the
board
in
all
honesty
is
confused.
they
get
confused
with
the
handles
they
try
to
apply
to
cases,
whether
it
is
pretext,
dual
motive,
or
any
other
thing
they
are
talking
about.
section
8
is
a...
and
specifically
8(a)(3)
addresses
the
issue
of
discrimination.
what
you
call
it
is
really
not
material.
what
is
material
is
that
the
board
must
raise
an
inference,
a
motivating
factor
for
conduct.
the
employer
must
come
forward
with
a
reason
or
some
reasons
to
show
what
he
has
done.
mr.
martin
ames
yes,
he
might,
and
in
fact
i
might--
mr.
martin
ames
--in
fact,
i
might
comment,
justice
white,
that
that
is
what
happens
generally
in
these
cases.
the
board
makes
a
charge,
or
a
complaint
comes
forward,
and
the
employer
says,
i
didn't
do
it.
it
is
sort
of
like,
if
i
might
use
a
hypo
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
martin
ames
--of
course.
in
the
hypo
i
was
going
to
use
in
response
to
that,
in
the
prima
facie
case,
is
what
we
see
in
tort
law
all
the
time.
two
cars
have
a
collision
at
an
intersection.
a
sues
b.
and
a
claims
that
but
for
the
negligence
of
b,
i
would
not
have
suffered
property
damage
or
personal
injury.
b
says,
i
didn't
do
it.
we
understand
it.
a
must
now
prove
that
but
for
the
negligence
of
b,
i
wouldn't
have
suffered
any
property
damage
or
personal
injury.
that's
the
role
of
the
prima
facie
case.
the
board
violates
that
important
role,
and
in
fact
violates
the
mandate
of
congress
in
its
burden
of
proof
it
established
in
10(c)
in
the
way
it
structured
its...
the
board's
wright-line
test.
mr.
martin
ames
no,
justice
stevens,
i
would
not
agree.
mr.
martin
ames
because
the
employer
doesn't
come
forward
and
say
anything
other
than,
i
fired
him...
before
he
does
that,
he
denies
that
he
has
done
anything
wrong.
mr.
martin
ames
the
numbers
of
cases
that
occurs
are
very
small,
i
would
say.
mr.
martin
ames
if
he
confesses
that
he
harbored
the
improper
motivation--
mr.
martin
ames
--and
that
led
to...
that
was
part
of
his
decision,
and
he
also
had
evidence
of
thievery--
mr.
martin
ames
--i
would
think
i
would
refer
then
back
to
what
i
think
section
8(a)(3)
is
all
about,
justice
stevens.
8(a)(3)
is
structured
in
some
way
to
accomplish
two
things.
on
the
one
hand,
to
ensure
that
an
employee's
employment
status
is
not
going
to
be
adversely
affected
for
his
engagement
in
protected
activity.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
not
intended,
we
believe,
to
provide
him
a
safe
harbor
should
he
engage
in
employment
misconduct.
mr.
martin
ames
in
the
hypothetical
you
have
presented
to
me,
in
fact,
he
might
harbor
this
impermissible
discriminatory
motivation,
but
he
now
has
some
showing
to
make
that
the
employee
engaged
in
misconduct.
the
act
was
not
intended
to
take
sides.
the
act
was
intended
to--
mr.
martin
ames
--yes.
mr.
martin
ames
in
the
hypo
as
i
understand
it
now,
that
is
correct,
but
in
the
instant
at
bar,
the
evidence
of
misconduct
occurred
or
came
to
the
attention
of
the
respondent
prior
to
even
any
engagement
in
protected
union
activity.
mr.
martin
ames
and
in
fact
the
respondent
put
in
motion
the
wheels
to
capture
the
evidence
to
show
that
in
fact
mr.
santola
was
cheating
and
thereby
getting
overcompensated.
to--
mr.
martin
ames
--it
might
apply
if
in
fact
it
occurs
that
the
employer
comes
forward
with
two
reasons.
mr.
martin
ames
as
in
mt.
healthy,
and
in
mt.
healthy,
when
you
discuss
affirmative
defense,
you
are
really
talking
about
the
concept
of
confession
and
avoidance.
in
industrial
relations
cases
before
the
board,
and
there
are
well
over
40,000
a
year
that
come
to
their
attention,
you
generally
do
not
have
that
situation.
you
have
a
situation
where
the
employer
denies
that
he
has
done
anything
wrong
and
he
can
generally
proffer
a
reason
for
his
conduct,
thereby
not
allowing
the
board
to
shift
from
what
they
consider
a
motivating
factor
which
occurs
in
the
prima
facie
showing
to
the
motivating
factor--
mr.
martin
ames
--which
is
nothing
different
than
in
part.
excuse
me.
mr.
martin
ames
judge
rehnquist,
i
think
this
case
is
rather
typical
when
you
look
at
the
fact
pattern
and
the
evidence
before
the
court.
the
employer
put
forth
just
his
reasons
for
terminating
the
employee
involved
in
protected
activity.
he
denied,
of
course,
the
allegation
that
he
violated
8(a)(3),
and
then
in
the
evidentiary
stage
of
this
litigation
he
articulated
the
reasons
for
terminating
the
employee.
and
that's
all
he
did,
simply,
and
what's
happening
in
this
particular
contest
is
that
the
board
is
confusing
what
happens
at
the
litigation
stage,
the
two-part
which
was
mentioned
earlier,
with
the
burdine
structure,
which
is
really
a
three-structured
concept
in
which
the
plaintiff
employee
in
the
title
7
matter
must
establish,
one,
that
she
is
in
a
protected
class,
on
the
ground
of
sex,
and--
mr.
martin
ames
--in
fact,
a
close
reading
of
the
appendix
will
show
you,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
board
not
only
produced
the
employee
to
allege
his
union
activity--
mr.
martin
ames
--but
general
counsel--
mr.
martin
ames
--testify
to.
but
general
counsel
also
called
the
agent
for
the
employer,
and
on
direct
examination,
elicited
from
the
respondent's
agent
the
grounds
for
the
termination,
which
was
cheating
on
his
time
card,
and
thereby
being
overcompensated.
and
in
fact
in
this
case
the
general
counsel
did
both
things.
mr.
martin
ames
yes,
the
trier
of
fact
had
the
entire
matter,
and
the
issue
raised
is
that
as
the
board
concluded,
the
employer
didn't
overcome
the
prima
facie
case.
we
think
that
is
error.
mr.
martin
ames
the
board,
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
has
the
burden
to
prove...
and
incidentally,
in
this
process,
compels
the
general
counsel
to
come
forward
with
sufficient
evidence
to
establish--
mr.
martin
ames
--it
would
be
our
contention
that
the
employer
prevails.
mr.
martin
ames
i
think
that
the
confusion
really
occurs
when
the
board
attempts
to
reconcile
its
wright-line
test,
articulated
by
the
board,
with
burdine,
and
the
confusion
is
very
simple.
the
board
says,
and
specifically
on
page
10
of
its
brief
on
the
merits,
that
its
test
is
fully
consistent
with
burdine,
fully
consistent,
having
recognized
that
the
prima
facie
case
is
an
inference,
and
that
compels
an
employer
now
to
have
an
affirmative
defense.
and
yet
when
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
board's
wright-line,
it
bases
its
understanding
of
an
employment
discrimination
test
on
mt.
healthy.
you
cannot
have
an
employer
with
an
affirmative
defense
and
also
suggest
that
your
employment
discrimination
test
is
also
consistent
with
this
conceptual
approach
of
a
three-part
system
where
the
plaintiff
employee
ultimately
must
bear
the
burden
persuasively
to
show
that
but
for
the
employer's
impermissible
discriminatory
motive,
he
will
not
have
acted
as
he
did.
that
is
the
mandate
of
the
act.
the
act
in
10(c)
and
generally
intends
to
make
it
relatively
easy
and
best
serves
the
parties
in
this
regard
if
it
is
easy
for
them
to
raise
a
prima
facie
case.
that
accomplishes
two
things
principally.
on
the
one
hand,
it
does
not
create
a
heavy
burden
for
the
employee
in
his
quest
for
relief.
he
can
come
forward,
show
that
he
was
involved
in
some
protected
union
activity,
and
he
has
created
a
motivation
for
the
employer.
the
inference
is
there.
the
employer,
on
the
other
hand,
cannot
sid
idly
by.
he
must
be
an
active
participant
in
this
litigation.
he
must
come
forward
and
proffer
a
reason
or
reasons.
if
he
does,
then
he
is
assisted
in
posturing
a
section
8
case
in
a
very
correct
way.
he
joins
the
factual
dispute.
10(c)
now
mandates
that
the
board,
by
compelling
the
general
counsel
to
do
its
work,
and
the
board
has
indicated
that,
in
fact,
in
its
own
rules,
the
general
counsel
should
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
all
section
8
cases,
to
come
forward
with
evidence
to
show
that
the
board
can
find
on
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
employer
either
acted
permissibly
or
otherwise.
in
other
words,
the
board
must
find
the
causal
relationship
between
the
employee's
conduct
and
the
employer's
conduct,
such
that
it
can
be
said
justifiably
that
but
for
that
employee's
engagement
in
protected
activity,
he
would
not
have
suffered
adversely
as
a
result
of
the
employee's
conduct.
that
is
the
mandate
of
the
act,
to
balance
competing
interests.
i
might
point
out
that
the
balancing
of
these
interests
occurred
long
before
wright-line
came
out
of
the
board
in
1980.
i
think
it
came
out
of
to
some
extent
what
this
court
tried
to
say
in
great
dane
in
'67,
which
was
shortly
after
the
adoption
of
the
amendments.
there,
the
court,
in
speaking
to
the
issue
that
a
violation
of
8(a)(3)
normally
turns
on
a
discriminatory
conduct
motivated
by
anti-union
activity
or
attitude
specifically
addressed
the
issue
of
burden
of
proof,
not
the
issue
of
burden
of
persuasion.
and
if
you
would
just
allow
me
for
a
moment,
i
would
like
to
quote
what
we
consider
the
critical
language
in
that
teaching
out
of
great
dane.
it
is
at
page
34
of
388.
"if
the
adverse
effect
of
the
discriminatory
conduct
on
employee
rights
is
comparatively
slight,
an
anti-union
motivation
may
be
proved
to
sustain
the
charge
if
the
employer
has
come
forward.
"
--i'm
sorry,
"is
comparatively
slight,
if
the
employer
has
come
forward
with
evidence
of
legitimate
and
substantial
business
justification
for
the
conduct.
"
the
court
even
as
early
as
'67
recognized
that
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
is
upon
this
board.
section
8
cases
must
be
structured
in
this
way.
it
is
an
ordered
approach
to
joining
a
factual
dispute
and
best
serves
the
parties
which
this
act
intended,
but
more
importantly,
it
compels
the
board
to
maintain
a
degree
of
neutrality
such
that
that
mandate
can
be
carried
out.
thank
you.
