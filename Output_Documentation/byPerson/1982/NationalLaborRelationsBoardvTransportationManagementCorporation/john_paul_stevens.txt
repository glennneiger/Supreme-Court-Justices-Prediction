justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
similar
question,
mr.
wallace,
right
on
this?
how
different
is
your
view
from
the
view
of
judge
briar?
in
other
words,
assume
we
don't
have
an
affirmative
defense,
but
just
a
question
whether
there
is
any
motivating
factor
at
all,
and
the
evidence
is
in
perfect
equipoise.
who
wins?
justice
john
paul
stevens
evidence
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
actual
anti-union
animus
was
a
motivating
factor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
does
the
general
counsel
differ
from
judge
briar's
view
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
in
the
category,
not
the
mt.
healthy
affirmative
defense
category,
but
the
other,
there
is
no
difference,
as
i
understand
you,
between
judge
briar
and
the
general
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
wallace?
you
never
got
to
this
case.
do
you
think
the
board's
findings
in
this
case
are
entirely
consistent
with
your
explanation
of
what
they
should
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ames,
i
am
not
sure
you
have
responded
to
the
second
half
of
justice
white's
question.
assume
you
have
a
case
in
which
the
employer
even
admits,
or
the
evidence
is
so
clear
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
motivated
his
decision
was
anti-union
bias.
he
doesn't
like
the
union.
he
doesn't
want
him
to
organize,
and
so
forth,
and
that
is
established,
but
he
nevertheless
says,
i
would
have
fired
him
anyway,
because
i
subsequently
discovered
that
he
is
a
thief.
now,
in
that
case,
would
you
not
agree
that
the
burden
would
be
on
the
employer
to
prove
that
affirmative
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
assuming
a
case
in
which
he
admits
the
anti-union
bias.
there
are
such
cases.
and
nevertheless
says,
i
would
have
fired
this
gentleman
anyway
because
he
is
a
thief.
you
say
that
he
doesn't
have
the
burden
of
proving
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
i
am
asking
you
about
that
hypothetical
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
that
was
part
of
his
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
he
didn't
even
have
the
evidence
of
thievery
until
after
he
had
fired
him,
just
to
make
it
a
really
clearcut
case.
the
day
after
he
fired
him,
he
found
out
that
he
was
a
thief,
and
he
said,
had
i
known
that
at
the
time,
i
would
have
fired
him
anyway,
and
therefore
you
cannot
order
reinstatement.
wouldn't
you
say
he
has
to
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
hypothetical
is
intended
to
parallel
the
mt.
healthy
case,
in
which
a
person
is
discharged
for
making
a
speech
somewhere,
and
then
the
school
board
wants
to
prove,
well,
yes,
that's
true,
but
upon
reviewing
his
qualifications,
we
can
prove
we
were
not
going
to
renew
his
contract
anyway,
because
he
is
such
a
bad
teacher,
and
there's
an
affirmative
defense,
and
i
thought
in
that
situation
the
board
had
the
burden
of
proving
the
affirmative
defense,
and
i
thought
the
same
might
well
apply
in
the
labor
context,
but
i
guess
you
say
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
give
you
one
other
hypothetical.
supposing
you've
got
three
people
who
make...
a
committee
to
make
discharge
decisions,
and
they
are
very
candid
about
their
reasons,
and
it
takes
all
three
of
them
to
fire
somebody.
two
of
them
say,
i
am
firing
this
man
because
he
is
late
to
work
every
day.
the
third
one
says,
i
am
firing
him
because
he
belongs
to
the
union.
and
that
is
the
three-man
decision.
who
wins?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
assuming
the
facts
are
undisputed
in
my
hypothetical.
it
is
an
easy
question
to
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
day.
will
you
tell
me,
then,
if
that
is
the
case,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
mt.
healthy
affirmative
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
board...
in
this
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
it
apply
when
there
is
proof
that
the
board
accepts
that
there
was
in
fact
an
actual
anti-union
animus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
different
from
my
thief
case?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
but
you
would
say
the
difference
is,
if
you
knew
he
was
a
thief
at
the
time
you
discharged
him,
but
the
thievery
was
only
one
of
the
reasons.
