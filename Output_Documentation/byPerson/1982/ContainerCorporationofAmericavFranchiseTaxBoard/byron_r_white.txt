justice

they
would
also,
i
take
it,
include
the
assets
in
the
calculations.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
wasn't
true
in--
justice
byron
r.
white
--although
there
was
some
interest
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
latcham,
would
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
if
these
subsidiaries
were
all
domestic
subsidiaries
operating
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
these
foreign
subsidiaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
be
making
the
latter
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
same...
so,
the
unitary
argument
is
the
same
whether
these
are
foreign
or
domestic
subsidiaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
i
suppose
the
parent
elected
the
boards.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean,
they
had
the
majority
of
the
directors?
do
you
mean--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
didn't
it
take
a
majority
vote
to
elect
all
the
directors?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
totally
different
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
elected
all
of
the
directors.
they
controlled
the
election
of
any
directors.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
that
they
put
their
own...
what
do
you
call
a
container
person
that
was
on
the
board?
he
also
held
an
office
in
container?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
it
work
out
if
the
subsidiary
has
a
loss?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
two-way
street.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
california
recognize
at
all
that
taxes
have
been
paid
on
some
of
this
income
that
it
has
included
in
this
formula?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
subsidiaries
paid
a
substantial
amount
of
dividends
to
container?
what
happens
to
those
dividends?
is
that
also
included
in
container's
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
california
do
about
a
british
corporation?
suppose
this
were
considered...
container,
is
it
an
illinois
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
if
it
were
a
british
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
with
headquarters
in
new
york.
what
would
california
do,
treat
it
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
didn't
have
a
subsidiary,
if
it
were
just
doing
business
there
and
had
income
from
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
solicitor
general
weighed
in
on
this
question,
not
in
this
case
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
say
just
to
the
extent
it
applies
to
foreign
corporations?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
this
kind
of
a
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
read
the
solicitor
general's
submission
in
the
chicago
railroad
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
disagree
with
your
colleague
on
the
other
side
that
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
on
that
basis,
the
whole
unitary
concept
is
meaningless
anyway.
in
any
situation...
in
any
of
these
situations,
you
could
do
your
work
through
divisions.
justice
byron
r.
white
--doesn't
the
solicitor
general
file
the
written
amicus
brief
in
the
chicago
bridge?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
that
is
a
pending
hearing,
is
it
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
set
for
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
there
is
a
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
what
about
the
same
question
justice
powell
put
to
you
about
his
position
there?
isn't
his
position
there
inconsistent
with
yours
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
argued
japan
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
involved
in
the
so-called
arm's-length
system
of
taxation?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
the
foreign
countries
do
who
are
taxing
these
particular
subsidiaries
involved
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
any
of
the
foreign
countries
put
an
income
tax
on
these
subsidiaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
they
tax
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
do
it
by
an
arm's-length
method?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
they
do
it?
they
don't
do
it
like
california
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
doesn't
use
the
formulary
system
like
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
system
is
unfair?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
whatever
system
it
is
that
venezuela
is
using.
justice
byron
r.
white
unfair
to
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
should
be
able
to
tax
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
parent
here,
so-called
parent,
owned
only
33
%
of
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
talking
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
chicago
bridge?
