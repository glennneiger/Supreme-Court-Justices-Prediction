j.

thank

counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
involves
a
california
franchise
tax
and
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
california.
that
court
sustained
a
tax
levied
under
california's
franchise
tax
act
against
appellant,
container
corporation,
rejecting
container's
argument
that
the
tax
as
applied
to
it
violated
the
due
process
and
commerce
clause
--
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution.
during
the
tax
years
involve,
container
corporation
controlled
some
20
foreign
subsidiaries
located
in
four
latin
american
and
four
european
countries.
the
california
franchise
tax
returns
filed
by
container
admitted,
however,
to
include
any
income
of
these
subsidiaries
and
also
omitted
all
of
its
subsidiaries,
payroll,
property
and
sales
in
calculating
the
share
of
its
net
income
which
was
apportionable
to
california
under
that
franchise
tax
acts
three-factor
formula.
california
took
the
position
that
container
should
have
treated
its
overseas
subsidiaries
as
part
of
its
unitary
business
rather
than
as
a
passive
investment
and
increased
container's
tax
liability
accordingly.
container
then
paid
the
additional
amounts
under
protest
and
sued
in
california
superior
court
for
a
refund,
raising
the
constitutional
challenges
the
increased
tax.
the
superior
court
upheld
california's
assessment
--
assessment
and
the
california
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
and
we
in
turn
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
the
opinion
we
have
filed
doesn't
readily
land
itself
to
oral
announcement
and
i'll
therefore
only
briefly
state
our
holdings
that
lead
to
our
conclusion.
first,
we
hold
that
california's
application
of
the
unitary
business
principle
to
container
and
its
foreign
subsidiaries
was
proper.
second,
we
hold
that
california's
use
of
the
three-factor
formula
of
payroll,
property,
and
sales
to
apportion
the
income
of
the
unitary
business
consisting
of
container
and
its
subsidiaries
was
fair.
third,
we
hold
that
california
had
no
obligation
under
the
foreign
commerce
clause
to
employ
the
arm's
length
analysis
used
by
the
federal
government
and
most
foreign
nations
in
evaluating
the
tax
consequences
of
intercorporate
relationships.
fourth,
we
hold
that
the
double
taxation
occasioned
by
the
california
scheme
is
not
constitutionally
impermissible.
fifth
and
finally,
we
hold
that
the
california
tax
does
not
violate
the
one
voice
standard
under
which
a
state
tax
at
variance
with
federal
policy
will
be
struck
down
if
it
either
implicates
foreign
policy
issues
which
must
be
left
to
the
federal
government
or
violates
a
clear
federal
directive.
