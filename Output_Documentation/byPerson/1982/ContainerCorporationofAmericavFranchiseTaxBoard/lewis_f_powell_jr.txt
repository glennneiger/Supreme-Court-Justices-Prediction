justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
general,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
sg's
position
in
caterpillar.
if
we
happen
to
agree
with
the
sg's
argument
as
presented
in
his
brief
in
that
case,
would
that
mean
that
we
would
have
to
address
you
in
this
case?
if
we
agreed
with
the
solicitor
general's
position
in
caterpillar,
would
that
control
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
relied
explicitly
on
japan
line
and
argued
that
it
was
clear
that
double
taxation
would
result.
he
carried
that
argument
over
into
the
caterpillar
case.
he
also
argued
quite
explicitly
that
the
united
states
government
had
an
interest
in
the
type
of
system
that
the
solicitor
general
supported
in
caterpillar
which
was
quite
different
from
the
unitary
formulary
apportionment
that
you
advocate.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
didn't
think
the
executive
branch
disagreed
with
your
position,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
solicitor
general
at
least
or
rather
explicitly
does
i
wonder
what
you--
