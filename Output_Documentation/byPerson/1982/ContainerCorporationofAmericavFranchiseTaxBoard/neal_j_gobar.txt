mr.
neal
j.
gobar
mr.
acting
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
here,
container
concedes,
apparently
for
the
purposes
of
domestic
taxation,
taxation
of
interstate
commerce
that
is,
and
also
it
concedes
for
the
purpose
of
taxing
its
own
activities
in
canada,
that
the
formula
apportionment
method
is
proper.
however,
it
seeks
preferential
treatment,
a
special
rule,
for
the
major
companies
which
are
doing
business
in
foreign
countries
through
their
subsidiaries.
it
apparently
seeks
to
draw
a
distinction
between
its
activities
through
a
subsidiary
in
a
foreign
country
and
its
activities
which
it
does
itself.
california
applies
the
formulary
apportionment
method,
the
combined
reporting
method,
uniformly
to
all
businesses.
it
feels
that
such
special
treatment
is
inappropriate;
that
its
treatment,
its
even-handed
treatment
of
all
unitary
business
operations
is
proper.
as
indicated,
there
are
two
commerce
clause
arguments
and
there
are
two
due
process
arguments
presented
by
plaintiff.
we
here
will
respond
first
to
the
commerce
clause
arguments.
we
will
talk
about
them
together.
we
feel
they
are
answered
substantially
by
this
court's
decisions
and
language
in
the
mobil
case,
bass,
ratcliff;
and,
secondly,
we
will
go
on
to
the
discussion
of
the
due
process
extraterritorial
argument
which
we
feel
is
most
recently
discussed
and
responded
to
in
this
court's
exxon
case.
thirdly,
we
will
talk
about
unitary
business
facts
which
we
feel
are
shown
to
clearly
exist
under
this
court's
most
recent
woolworth
statement
of
the
rule
and
the
test
and
the
butler
brothers
case
which
clearly
applies
the
unitary
formula
in
a
situation
similar
to
this
and
we
feel
that
the
facts,
as
appear
in
the
record,
unlike
those
partial
statements
of
facts
which
your
honor
has
heard
properly
by
an
advocate
this
afternoon
will
clearly
establish
that
we
have
a
clear
unitary
business
here.
first,
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause
argument,
these
are
predicated
upon
this
court's
1979
japan
line
argument
and
case
and
decision
which
did
not
involve
a
situation
which
we
have
here
and
we
feel
is
not
applicable.
we
feel
this
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
mobil
case
as
well
as
in
the
language
of
the
japan
line
case
itself.
that
case,
which
involved
a
taxation
of
a
foreign
instrumentality
which
was
in
the
united
states
solely
while
moving
in
foreign
commerce,
and
had
been
subject
pursuant
to
a
specific
convention
to
taxation
in
full
at
its
place
of
domicile
is
certainly
the
opposite
of
what
we
have
here.
we
are
here
talking
about
taxing
a
unitary
business.
we
are
here
talking
about
taxing
an
american
company.
the
considerations
before
the
court
in
the
japan
line
are
not
the
considerations
when
we
are
taxing
an
american
company
who
chooses
to
do
business
in
foreign
countries
by
setting
up
separate
subsidiaries
which
it
fully
controls
and
operates
as
part
of
its
unitary
business
rather
than
merely
sending
its
own
employees
there
as
a
division.
unlike
the
japan
line
case,
here
we
have
no
federal
one
voice
which
prevents
combined
reporting.
as
has
been
indicated
by
questions
of
the
court
already,
congress
has
refused
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
to
limit
the
power
of
the
states
to
tax
unitary
businesses
by
formula
apportionment.
congress
has
had
a
number
of
bills
before
it
for
a
number
of
years.
congress
is
the
appropriate
person,
the
appropriate
agency,
to
place
limitations
upon
the
state's
right
to
tax...
to
use
the
formulary
method
of
taxing
particularly
with
respect
to
domestic
corporations.
the
executive
department
at
no
time,
not
withstanding
the
contentions
of
the
solicitor
general
in
a
different
case,
at
no
time,
to
our
knowledge,
has
suggested
that
there
be
any
limitation
placed
upon
the
taxation
by
the
state
of
income
of
a
unitary
business
which
is
controlled
by
an
american
company
such
as
container
here.
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
only
on
one
occasion
was
it
suggested
that
even
activities
of
any
foreign-controlled
company
be
subjected
to
a
different
treatment
than
the
fair
uniform
treatment
which
we
have
by
formula
apportionment.
and,
that
case,
as
indicated,
was
rejected
by
the
senate
and
we
have
no
knowledge
of
any
attempt
by
the
executive
branch
to
pursue
that
matter
further.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
we
are
talking...
when
i
say
"foreign-controlled
company",
i
am
talking
about
a
foreign
company
who
has
a
subsidiary
here.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
which
is
not
this
case.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
that
is
a
very
different
case.
the
commerce
clause--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--i
read
that
just
like
i
read
the
ac
briefs
filed
by--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--yes.
i
believe
that
his
main
concern
is
with
the
foreign
commerce
and
not
with
how
we
tax
our
domestic
companies.
i
believe
the
indications
of
this
court
in
the
japan
line
case,
the
fear
of
retaliation,
with
respect
to
that
other
situation
which
we
do
not
have
here.
i
haven't
seen
any
suggestion
of
any
foreign
country,
nor
do
i
believe
there
is,
that
they
are
concerned
how
the
united
states
taxes
container
corporation.
and
that
is
all
we
are
doing
here.
we
are
taxing
container
corporation.
the
only
question
is
how
do
we
measure
container
corporation's
tax.
i
don't
think
colombia
would
want
us
telling
them
how
they
can
tax
a
company
which
is
in
colombia.
what
these
plaintiffs
are
here
trying
to
do
is
they
are
a
domestic
company
and
they
are
wrapping
themselves
in
a
foreign
flag.
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
we
are
talking
about
taxation
of
a
domestic
company
who
chooses
to
go
into
foreign
countries
and
set
up
subsidiaries.
this
operation
could
have
been
conducted
through
divisions
and
in
that
case
presumably
there
would
be
no
question,
as
this
court
seemed
to
indicate
in
the
mobil
case.
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
appropriateness
of
our
tax.
we
see
no
substantial
distinction
that
there
is
any
basis
for
a
different
rule
since
they
choose
to
do
business
through
subsidiaries.
if
this
were
not
the
case,
form
would
control
over
substance.
and,
as
container
went
to
colombia
in
the
1940's
and
set
up
this
subsidiary
business
and
operation,
they
could
go
there,
start
the
operations,
and
while
it
is
a
loss
operate
it
as
a
division.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
the
unitary
formula
method
should
be
applicable
as
california
has
uniformly
applied
it
regardless
of
the
activities...
whether
the
unit...
you
have
to
have
a
unitary
business,
but
regardless
of
whether
the
unit
is
operated
through
a
single
corporation
or
through
a
parent
in
a
number
of
subsidiaries,
the
treatment
has
to
be
the
same
if
they
are
both
unitary
businesses
to
avoid
the
ability,
which
the
major
companies
here
are
trying
to
retain
in
this
case,
to
shift
their
income
by
switching
from
a
division
situation,
subject
to
formula
apportionment
while
it
is
a
loss,
and
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
when
they
start
they
are
losses,
and
you
run
your
loss
divisions
in
and
that
reduces
your
california
tax.
italy
was
a
loss
during
this
period.
some
of
the
other
foreign
subsidiaries
which
they
have
here,
they
were
allocated,
even
taking
the
cca's
figures,
which
we
feel
are
wrong,
but
even
accepting
their
figures,
some
of
the
income
was
increased,
would
have
been
increased
under
the
formula
method.
so,
it
is
not
a
one-way
street.
we
have
a
fair
method
and
it
goes
either
way.
the
caterpillar
case,
which
was
argued
before
your
honor
last
april,
is
a
good
illustration.
it
is
a
fair,
even,
two-way
street.
needless
to
say,
taxpayers
normally
will
not
come
and
object
if
we
reduce
their
tax
through
the
formula
apportionment
so
the
only
cases
you
will
see
is
where
it
is
increased.
but,
as
we
indicated,
there
is
no
one-voice
situation
here
where...
equivalent
to
that
we
had
in
japan
line.
further,
with
respect
to
the
presentation
of
the
solicitor
general,
in
oral
argument
the
solicitor
general
conceded
that
there
was
no
treaty
anywhere,
any
specific
provision
of
any
treaty
which
precluded
its
use.
so,
he
doesn't
disagree
on
that
point.
and,
as
i
indicated,
we
think
basically
this
is
a
type
of
question,
any
restrictions
on
the
state,
is
a
matter
for
congress
and
for
the
treaty
process
to
be
followed.
this
is
not
a
constitutional
limitation.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
the
oral
argument
in
the
cdi
caterpillar
case.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
last
term.
i
think
it
was
april,
your
honor.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
not
if
it
is
what
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
well,
the
solicitor
general,
in
a
brief
in
caterpillar...
incidentally,
if
i
might
give
the
citation
on
that.
that
was
april
19th
oral
argument
and
reporter's
transcript
page
18.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
he
did
in
that
case.
he
has
not
filed
anything--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--it
is
not
in
tandem
with
this
case.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
it
is
pending.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
it
is
still
undecided
by
this
court.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
that
is
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
well,
he
makes
a
broad
statement.
for
example,
he
says
there
is
double
taxation
in
the
container
corporation.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
and
he
argued
japan
line.
we
strongly
deny
that.
there
is
no
double
taxation
here
in
fact
or
in
law.
so,
if
you
agree
with
him
on
that,
then
we
are
in
a
little
bit
of
trouble.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
the
facts
here
do
not
show
double
taxation,
your
honor,
because
all
california
is
doing
is
apportioning
eight
percent
of
the
total
worldwide
income
to
california.
the
taxpayer
concedes
that
about
seven
percent
of
the
total
worldwide
income
is
possibly
taxable
by
california.
we
have
taxed
only
less
than
one
percent
difference
in
this
taxation.
now,
even
if
you
accept
the
figures
from
colombia,
the
separate
accounting
figures...
first
of
all,
i
would
state,
i
don't
think
anywhere
in
the
record
is
there
any
showing
of
what
the
actual
tax
basis
was
by
any
of
these
countries.
there
is
lots
of
talk
of
separate
accounting
records,
there
is
some
talk...
they
don't
even
know
the
actual
taxes
that
were
paid.
they
say,
but,
our
2952's
reported
to
the
federal
government
show
that
they
are
something
like
this,
but
we
don't
know
what
their
actual
tax
basis
was.
but,
even
if
you
accept
their
figures
and
you
total
the
amount
of
tax
which
the
state
of
california
taxed
and
the
amount
of
tax
which
all
of
them
taxed,
that
is
less
than
15
%
of
the
worldwide
income.
they
simply
have
not
shown
any
improper
tax
by
california.
further--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--i
don't
define
the
term,
your
honor,
and
i
stay
away
from
it,
because,
quite
frankly,
i
think
it
has
been
used
in
many
different
cases
to
mean
different
things.
when
somebody
says
double
taxation,
they
automatically
mean
something--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--we
agree
100
%,
your
honor,
exactly.
you
are
talking...
in
the
property
tax
in
the
japan
line
case,
they
said
we
will
take
a
situs
taxation
approach
and
following
the
treaty
or
whether
the
old
method
of
domocile
or
whatever
it
may
be,
we
will
accept
the
full
tax
at
the
domicile.
the
whole
basic
principle
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here
today,
unitary
apportionment,
is
predicated
on
the
recognition
that
you
cannot
assign
a
site
to
income.
you
have
an
indivisible
item.
whether
you
divide
the
income
of
a
unitary
business
by
separate
accounting
or
formulary
apportionment
or
whatever
method,
you
are
trying
to
divide
something
which
is
indivisible.
and,
the
income
comes
from
the
operation
as
a
whole
and
that
is
why
the
japan
line
analysis
is,
we
feel,
totally
inappropriate
to
be
applied
in
this
particular
case.
we
feel...
we
don't
deny
that
the
court
had
a
legitimate
concern
with
unfair
or
excessive
taxation
by
any
one,
but,
as
applied
to
unitary
apportionment,
we
feel
that
the
standard
has
to
be
basically
the
same
idea
that
we
have
in
the
due
process.
you
have
to
look
to
see
what
the
fair
apportionment
of
the
business
unit.
in
this
case,
the
methods...
the
double
taxation
problem
won't
go
away
by
ruling
for
caterpillar
because...
for
example,
let's
take
colombia
and
venezuela.
first
of
all,
there
are
no
treaties,
no
tax
treaties
between
the
united
states
and
venezuela
or
colombia
or
mexico.
therefore,
they
are
free
to
do
whatever
taxation
any
way
they
want
to.
in
fact,
what
they
do
is
they
don't
allow
deductions
of
expenses
which
are
incurred
out
of
the
country.
therefore,
they
don't
even
allow,
for
their
tax
purposes,
a
deduction
of
any
of
the
expenses
of
the
expertise
which
might
be
provided
by
the
parent.
there
is
no
limit.
they
could
tax
on
an
unlimited
amount
of
income.
they
can
measure
it
any
way
they
want
to.
and,
it
is
indicated
in
the
stipulation
that
even
the
general
accepted
accounting
methods
are
inappropriate,
are
different,
in
some
of
the
foreign
countries
than
they
are
in
the
united
states.
basically,
and
this
also
answers
the
contention
of
the
solicitor
general,
we
just
do
not
have
here
any
one
voice.
the
so-called
arm's-length
method,
there
is
no
suggestion,
there
is
no
showing
that
it
has
been
applied
by
anyone.
and,
on
the
contrary,
the
recent
studies
which
have
been
provided
by
the
u.s.
government
last
year
by
the
general
accounting
office,
show
and
suggest
that
the
so-called
method
of
arm's
length,
which
counsel
for...
which
the
appellant
would
have
this
court
say
is
a
one
voice,
must-have-been-adopted
situation,
there
is
no
uniformity
in
that.
the
gao
says
we
don't
think
it
works
very
well.
in
fact,
the
most
used
method
is
the
apportionment
type
method
and
we
suggest
you
consider
the
federal
government
going
to
apportionment.
a
number
of
commentators
who
are
mentioned...
this
discussion
is
contained
in
the
brief
of
the
multistate
tax
commissioner
in
the
chicago
bridge
and
iron
case.
since
the
solicitor
general's
brief
wasn't
filed
in
this
case,
the
response
was
filed
by
mtc
in
that
case...
shows
that
we
do
not
have
one
voice.
their
method
is
not
working
and
commentators
have
criticized
it
severely.
now,
i
am
not
saying
that
this
is
a
panacea
or
the
easy
answer
or
that
there
are
no
problems
with
taxation
by
the
formula
apportionment.
what
i
am
saying
is
it
is
not
the
type
of
problem
that
is
to
be
solved
by
saying
that
the
due
process
clause
or
the
commerce
clause
prohibits
the
states
from
using
the
method.
we
submit
it
is
the
best
method
available
at
this
time;
that
if
it
is
to
be
restricted,
if
it
is
to
be
used,
it
should
be
done
by
congress
after
appropriate
studies,
after
appropriate
evaluation.
and,
if
there
are
to
be
limitations
upon
the
states'
use
of
it,
there
should...
and,
the
executive
department
feels
it
is
appropriate,
there
should
be
appropriate
hearings
and
evaluation
and
find
a
good
or
better
method.
so
far...
california
has
been
using
this
method
for,
i
think
half
a
century.
we
have
not
found
a
better
method
and
we
don't
think
the
united
states
has
either.
we
think
it
is
the
fairest
method.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
well,
what
is
involved
in
it
is
theoretically
you
take
this
unitary
business,
which
this
court
has
said
by
its
very
nature
is
indivisible,
and
say
we
try
to
divide
it.
we
try
to
assume
that
we
could
separate
these--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--i
have
never
heard
of
a
foreign
country
doing
it.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
only
country
that
has
any
kind
of
regulation
of
any
detail
as
to
what
to
do
in
these
cases
is
the
united
kingdom.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
they
tax
them
by
their
own
separate
accounting
or
whatever
method
they
use.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
i
don't
think
they
do
it
by
an
arm's-length
method,
because,
for
example--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--i
don't
know
the
details
of
how
they
do
it.
all
we
know
from
this
record
is
that
colombia
has
taxed
them
and
other
people
have
imposed
their
income
taxes.
but,
we
do
know,
we
do
know
that
when
colombia
does
tax
the
subsidiary
there,
it
does
not
allow
any
deduction
for
payment
for
services
rendered
in
the
united
states
for
its
effect.
so,
therefore,
we
do
know--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--as
far
as
i
know,
it
does
not
use
a
formulary
method
for
its
own
determination
nor
does
it
use
an
arm's-length
method.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
which,
the
arm's-length
method?
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
whatever
they
use?
yes,
i
think
it
is
unfair.
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
well--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--no,
i
think
they
should
tax
less.
i
think
they
should
tax
less,
because
we
have
shown
here,
your
honor,
that
there
are
substantial
contributions
by
cca
to
these
foreign
subsidiaries.
it
guarantees
or
loans
60
%
of
the
monies
these
foreign
subsidiaries
get
and
there
has
been
no
indication
they
get
any
substantial
payment
for
it.
so,
there
is
no
expense
going
out
of
colombia
and
they
are
taxing
all
of
the
benefits
there.
well,
in
the
united
states,
there
would
either
be
a
formulary
apportionment
or
we
would
have
to...
if
we
applied
an
arm's-length
method,
we
would
have
to
determine
what
is
an
appropriate
method
of
giving
a
deduction
and
reducing
those
amounts.
the
other
problem
with
the...
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
is
there
is
no
uniformity.
even
the
so-called
arm's-length
method
is
not
a
uniformly
adopted--
mr.
neal
j.
gobar
--no,
no,
your
honor.
california
has
no
dispute
with
the
asarco.
we
do
not
try
to
include
any
of
the
subsidiaries
in
asarco
that
were
excluded
there.
we
require
that
there
be
actual
control.
nor
do
we
have
any
dispute
with
woolworth.
we
require
that
there
be
actual
control,
effective
control,
and
we
say
that
there
has
been
and
is
here
actual
effective
control.
all
subsidiaries
were
100
%
owned
or
80
%
in
one
country
and
two-thirds
in
the
other
one
and
there
was,
in
fact,
absolute
control.
and,
with
my
time
running
out,
if
i
may
just
get
to
a
few
points,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
this
case
is
very
unitary.
the
facts
are
set
forth
in
the
brief,
but
there
is
functional
integration
clearly
from
the
record
here.
cca
provided
and
trained
expert
personnel
for
key
corporate
and
operational
jobs
for
the
subsidiaries.
caa
provided
the
machinery
as
well
as
the
expertise
which
was
necessary
to
set
up
these
foreign
companies
and
operate
these
foreign
manufacturing
outfits.
they
provided
90
%
of
the
latin
america's
machinery
directly.
these
amounts
were
$5
million
to
$7
million
a
year.
they
had
technical
service
agreements
wherever
the
country
law
allowed
them
which
specifically
provided
for
furnishing,
at
the
request
of
the
subsidiaries
as
needed,
of
any
technical
or
other
business
assistance.
they
guaranteed
and
loaned
over
60
%
of
the
funds.
they
established
these
subsidiaries
and
participated
in
the
establishment
and
any
capital
decisions
had
to
go
through
the
parent.
it
was
just
the
local
decisions
that
were
left
to
the
operation
locally.
and,
this
is
no
different
than
the
operation
within
the
united
states.
they
were
all
diversified
companies.
exxon
was
a
diversified
company.
they
had
their
separate
divisions
which
had
autonomous
responsibility.
but,
if
they
didn't
operate,
they
were
told
to...
they
were
controlled
and
overruled
as
necessary
above.
they
had
centralized
management.
they
had
an
overseas
division
whose
purpose
was
to
oversee
and
insure
compliance
with
the
standards
and
with
the
profitability
of
the
subsidiaries.
they
used
the
same
auditing
except
for
two
eureopean
subsidiaries.
they
had
overlapping
directors
and
officers.
they
retained
employee
benefits.
people
that
went
to
the
foreign
subsidiaries
retained
employee
benefits
and
obviously
loyalty
to
the
cca.
they
had
to
give
all
financial
and
tax
reports
necessary
to
effect
their
supervision.
and,
in
fact,
it
is
stipulated
that,
in
fact,
cca
controlled,
on
page
14
of
the
joint
appendix,
they
controlled
the
subs.
we
feel
that
these
are
all
indications...
oh,
i
forgot
to
talk
about
mr.
latcham's
flow
of
goods.
they
obtained
through
central
purchasing...
they
obtained,
not
huge
amounts,
but
substantial
amounts.
they
directed
furnished...
i
believe
it
has
been
suggested
at
least
one
percent,
and
these
are
all
estimates,
because
the
records
haven't
been
made
available
in
detail,
but
they
also
procured,
just
like
in
butler
brothers,
they
procured
another
substantial
amount
of
the
raw
materials
which
were
used
by
the
subsidiaries.
when
you
are
dealing
in
foreign
countries,
when
you
are
dealing
in
the
paperboard
packaging,
normally
you
are
not
going
to
be
shipping
raw
materials
long
distances.
you
are
going
to
get
them
locally.
but,
the
mere
fact
that
they
did
have
to
furnish
a
significant
amount
shows
that
the
importance...
it
is
much
more
significant
in
a
case
like
this
that
there
is
a
five
percent
or
six
percent
furnishing.
that
shows
they
are
there.
that
shows
they
are
giving
them
support.
we
feel
that
the
test
of
this
court,
which
has
been
applied
most
recently
in
woolworth,
looking
at
the
economic
realities,
the
income
is
not
derived
from
an
unrelated
business
activity
which
constitutes
a
discreet
business
enterprise.
we
think
they
are
clearly
unitary.
i
am
through.
i
haven't
spoken
of
distortion.
we
feel
no
distortion
is
shown.
thank
you,
your
honor.
