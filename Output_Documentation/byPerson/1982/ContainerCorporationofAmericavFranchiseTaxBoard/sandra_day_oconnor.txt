now,
the
flow
of
goods
test
was
not
really
one
that
was
suggested
by
this
court
in
the
majority
opinion
in
asarco
and
woolworth,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day

mr.
latcham,
in
our
proposed
treaty
with
the
united
kingdom,
the
senate,
of
course,
removed
the
language
that
would
have
denied
the
states
the
right
to
apply
this
formulary
apportionment
which
certainly
is
at
least
an
indicator
that
the
federal
government
isn't
interested
in
speaking
with
one
voice
in
this
area.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
it
is
a
negative
indicator
in
that
argument,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
can
you
say
that
for
in
colombia,
for
example,
where
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
the
amount
of
that
you
have
attributed
for
their
whole
income
down
there?
how
can
you
say
that
the
facts
here
do
not
show
double
taxation?
