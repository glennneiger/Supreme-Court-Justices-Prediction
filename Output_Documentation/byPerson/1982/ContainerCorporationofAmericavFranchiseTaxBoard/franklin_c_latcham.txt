mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
california
court
of
appeals,
the
california
supreme
court
having
declined
to
hear
the
case.
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
trial
court
in
holding
that
container
corporation
of
american,
appellant
herein,
and
its
foreign
subsidiaries
were
engaged
in
one
unitary
business.
however,
the
court,
in
its
opinion,
based
its
opinion
upon
different
legal
standards
than
those
adopted
by
this
court
in
the
recent
asarco
and
woolworth
cases.
the
court
also
rejected
container's
other
constitutional
arguments.
this
case
again
presents
the
unitary
business
issue,
but
in
a
context
different
from
asarco
and
woolworth.
there
the
cases
involved
taxation
by
a
non-domociliary
state
of
dividends
from
foreign
subsidiaries.
here
a
non-domociliary
state,
california,
is
attempting
to
combine
the
parent
and
foreign
subsidiaries'
income
in
one
tax
base
and
apportion
part
of
that
income
to
california
by
the
payroll/property/sales
formula.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
they
would
include
the
subsidiaries'
assets
in
the
calculations,
is
that
your
question?
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
in
the
formula,
that
is
right.
the
subsidiaries'
payroll,
property,
and
sales
are
included
in
the
denominator
of
the
formula.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
which
was
not
true
in
asarco
and
woolworth,
but
the
court
didn't
get
to
that
specific
problem.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
yes.
here,
as
contrasted
with
asarco
and
woolworth,
there
is
immediate
state
taxation
of
the
foreign
subsidiaries'
income
even
though
it
is
not
distributed
to
the
parent.
in
regard
to
the
unitary
issue,
container...
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing
about
the
order
of
our
arguments.
container's
position
is
that
it
may
prevail
on
any
one
of
the
following
arguments:
first,
under
the
due
process
clause
because
container
is
not
unitary
with
its
foreign
subsidiaries;
second,
under
the
due
process
clause
because
california
is
taxing
extraterritorial
income
due
to
distortion
in
the
formula;
third,
under
the
commerce
clause
because
of
double
taxation;
and,
fourth,
under
the
commerce
clause
because
the
california
system
prevents
the
united
states
from
speaking
with
one
voice
in
the
field
of
foreign
relations.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
i
think,
your
honor--
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
--we
would
be
making
the
unitary
argument.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and,
also,
i
think
we
would
be
making...
the
due
process
distortion
argument
is
the
same.
in
regard
to
the
unitary
argument,
container
and
its
foreign
subsidiaries
are
a
separate
business
operation.
now,
i
would
say
in
regard
to
reviewing
the
facts,
container
has
no
quarrel
in
general
with
the
court
of
appeals'
statement
of
fact
except
in
a
few
instances
noted
in
our
main
brief
in
which
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
made
errors
in
its
statement,
but
we
believe
we
would
prevail
on
the
statement
of
facts
in
the
court
of
appeals
case.
we,
of
course,
disagree
with
their
legal
conclusion.
in
any
event,
we
would
invite
the
court
to
read
the
record,
which
is
rather
short,
comprising
a
stipulation
of
facts
and
uncontroverted
testimony.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
yes.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
well,
the
administrative
proceeding
in
california
was
under
a
protest
due
to
the
franchise
tax
board
based
on
their
proposed
deficiency
based
on
the
fact
that
container
and
its
subsidiaries
were
unitary.
so,
there
was
that
informal
administrative
proceeding
in
which
the
franchise
tax
board
held
that
they
were
unitary,
the
deficiency
was
upheld,
we
then
went
to
court.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
well,
we
went
about
stipulating
the
facts
much
as
we
have
done
in
many,
many
cases
in
california.
we
took
statements
from
the
employees
and
principal
officers
of
the
parent
company,
presented
that
information
to
the
franchise
tax...
or
the
deputy
attorney
general
representing
the
franchise
tax
board.
of
course,
he
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
any
questions
or
look
at
any
documents
or
records
he
cared
to
including
the
full
audit
statement
and
that
is
how
i
prepared
it.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
the
total
amount
of
tax
in
controversy
is
approximately
$71,000
for
the
three
years
in
question.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
that
is
right.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
three
years,
yes.
that
is
on
page
nine
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
for
all
intervening
years
up
through
1972,
the
stipulation
says
the
franchise
tax
board
determined
additional
liabilities
due
to
the
proposal
worldwide
combination,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
it
is
a
long
time
ago
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
problem
is
even
with
us
today,
i
am
told,
the
company
and
many
other
companies.
container
is
a
delaware
corporation
with
headquarters
in
chicago.
it
manufactures
and
sells
cartons
and
boxes
within
the
united
states
with
some
sales
to
puerto
rico
and
canada.
the
subsidiaries
are
organized
and
operating
in
six
countries,
three
in
europe,
germany,
the
netherlands,
and
italy,
and
three
in
latin
america,
colombia,
venezuela,
and
mexico.
the
subsidiaries
are
involved
generally
in
the
same
line
of
business
as
the
parent,
however,
the
subsidiaries
are
fully
integrated,
self-sustaining
operational
units.
they
buy
most
of
their
raw
materials
locally.
they
manufacture
and
sell
within
their
countries
of
operation
with
some
sales
into
contiguous
countries,
but
none
into
the
united
states.
the
most
profitable
subsidiaries
are
those
in
colombia
and
venezuela
and
have
substantial
outside
shareholders.
a
third
of
the
shareholders
in
colombia
are
local
people,
20
%
in
venezuela.
the
subsidiaries
make
no
sales
of
raw
materials
or
finished
products
to
the
parent.
the
parent
makes
no
sales
of
finished
products
to
the
subsidiaries
and
only
a
small
percentage,
less
than
one
percent,
of
the
subsidiaries'
purchases
of
raw
materials
to
the
subsidiaries.
these
sales,
incidentally,
were
for
fair
market
value
and
could
have
been
purchased
from
other
parties.
the
subsidiaries
did
no
business
in
california
or
the
united
states.
they
have
no
property,
payroll,
or
sales
in
california
or
the
united
states.
their
business
was
entirely
within
their
own
countries
with
some
sales
to
contiguous
countries.
now,
we
believe
that
under
the
clear
guidelines
of
the
asarco
and
woolworth
cases
that
container
must
prevail
on
the
unitary
issue.
in
those
cases,
the
court
said...
of
course,
you
have
to
have
majority
ownership,
but
the
court
said,
the
following
factors
of
profitability
must
arise
from
the
business
as
a
whole,
functional
integration,
centralized
management,
economies
of
scale.
in
this
case,
there
is
little,
if
any,
functional
integration.
as
i
said,
the
subsidiaries
were
fully
integrated,
self-sustaining
units.
there
was
no
meaningful
product
flow
between
parent
and
subsidiaries.
we
suggested
in
the
main
brief
that
the
court
might
consider
the
product
flow
as
a
bright-line
standard
in
determining
the
unitary
business
doctrine.
we
would
restrict
this,
of
course,
to
manufacturing,
mercantile,
and
producing
business.
this
would
be
an
objective
test
as
compared
to
the
more
subjective
test
involved
in
central
management
and
economy
of
scale.
such
a
test
would
arise
from
the
reason
for
formulary
apportionment
which
is
the
inability
of
the
state
to
determine
where
income
is
earned.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
was
suggested.
it
was
certainly
to
me
inferred
from
the
language
of
the
majority
opinion
in
which
the
court
talked
about
a
flow
of
international
commerce
and
they
did
talk
about
a
flow
of
product
in
the
discussion
of
what
is
functional
integration
in
the
ruling.
the
subsidiaries
all
had
their
own
departments
necessary
to
the
operation
of
their
business
such
as
engineering,
design,
accounting,
personnel,
and
so
forth.
they
occasionally
sought
technical
information
from
container,
but
for
the
most
part,
they
solved
their
own
problems
themselves
or
with
the
use
of
independent
consultants.
as
in
the
woolworth
case,
no
phase
of
any
subsidiaries'
business
was
integrated
with
that
of
the
parent
nor
was
there
centralization
of
management
as
discussed
in
asarco
and
woolworth.
the
subsidiaries'
management
were
solely
responsible
for
the
day-to-day
operation
and
all
other
aspects
of
their
business.
they
were,
incidentally,
mostly
local
people.
container's
only
involvement
was
the
approval
of
major
capital
appropriations
which
originated
from
the
subsidiaries.
of
course,
as
in
asarco
and
woolworth,
there
were
discussions
back
and
forth
between
container
and
the
subsidiaries,
but
the
subsidiaries
management
were
in
control
and
held
responsible
for
the
operations.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
that
the
parent
had
less
than
a
majority
of
the
directors
on
the
overall.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
they
elected
less
than
a
majority.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
no.
i
mean
they
had
less
than
a
majority
of
container
personnel
as--
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
--yes.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
well,
yes,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
yes,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
was
about
to
say
that,
of
course,
in
the
case
of
the
colombian
and
venezuelan
subsidiaries
the
public
shareholders
would
have
the
right
to
elect
directors
and
the
stipulation
of
facts
also
states
that
for
the
most
part
the
container
personnel
who
were
directors
were
not
directly
involved
in
the
operation
of
the
subsidiaries.
as
i
said,
of
course,
there
were
discussions
back
and
forth
between
the
parent
and
subsidiaries
much
like
those
in
the
woolworth
case.
in
essence,
we
maintain
that
container's
management
was
overseeing
its
investment
in
the
subsidiaries.
certainly
there
was
no
economy
of
scale
arising
from
centralized
management
in
this
case.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
i
am
not
suggesting
it
is
the
same
as
if
the
foreign
subsidiaries
were
operating
hotels,
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
have
said,
there
was
occasional
technical
information
and
other
services
that
came
from
container
to
the
subsidiaries
but
we
would
maintain
this
is
not
an
economy
of
scale.
in
other
words,
the
various
departments
of
container
did
not
also
provide
the
same
services
to
the
subsidiaries
so
that
the
accounting
department
of
container
or
the
personnel
department
or
the
tax
or
engineering
were
doing
the
same
work
for
container
and
the
same
work
for
the
subsidiaries.
there
was
not
that
duplication
going
on,
therefore,
there
was
not
a
spreading
of
cost
that
would
come
from
such
duplication.
in
place
of
the
three
tests
stated
in
asarco
and
woolworth,
the
franchise
tax
board
argues
for
a
sweeping
contribution
test
plus
a
presumption
that
corporations
are
unitary
if
they
are
in
the
same
line
of
business.
this
is
essentially
the
test
used
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
in
essence,
we
maintain
the
franchise
tax
board
is
suggesting
that
this
court
should
overrule
asarco
and
woolworth
and
reinstate
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
below
as
the
proper
test
for
a
unitary
business.
going
on
to
due
process
question,
we
believe
that
it
is
clear
that
extraterritorial
income
is
being
taxed
and
that
worldwide
unitary
method
of
california
is
invalid
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
case.
the
facts
here
show
california
is
attempting
to
reach
out-of-state
income.
as
i
have
said,
the
subsidiaries
do
no
business
in
california
or
the
united
states.
they
have
no
payroll
property,
or
sales
in
california
or
the
united
states.
california
is
providing
no
services
to
those
subsidiaries.
in
fact,
there
is
no
showing
that
container's
operational
profits,
that
is
the
profits
it
got
from
its
business
in
the
united
states
and
california,
were
enhanced
by
the
operation
of
the
subsidiaries
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
franchise
tax
board
claiming
that
formulary
apportionment
makes
for
a
better
determination
of
container's
income.
of
course,
the
effect
is
to
shift
substantial
income
from
the
subsidiaries,
particularly
in
venezuela
and
colombia,
to
container,
and,
therefore,
to
california.
but,
we
maintain
the
formulary
apportionment
is
skewed
in
the
international
arena.
it
works
all
right
within
the
domestic
united
states
where
we
have
the
same
political
system
and
a
homogeneous
economy.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
how
does
it
work
if
the
subsidiary
has
a
loss?
then,
indeed,
your
honor,
part
of
the
income
of
container
would
be
apportioned
to
the
subsidiary
and,
of
course,
the
other
way
around.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
well,
it
is
not
a
two-way
street,
of
course,
in
this
case,
because
the
very
substantial
profits
of
the
subsidiaries
which
have
been
going
on
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
as
i
have
said,
in
the
international
arena
in
this
case,
and
we
would
maintain
generally,
especially
in
regard
to
developing
countries
where
you
have
a
much
lower
payroll
and
profitability
is
higher,
you
are
going
to
have
distortion
and
this
case
illustrates;
the
wages
here
in
colombia
and
venezuela,
which
are
the
most
profitable
subsidiaries,
were
lower
and
the
profitability
much
higher.
as
a
result,
half
of
the
income
of
the
venezuelan
and
colombian
subsidiaries
is
apportioned
to
container
and,
therefore,
partly
to
california.
each
of
those
subsidiaries
earned
about
$4
million
a
year.
half
of
that,
$2
million,
by
formulary
apportionment,
is
apportioned
to
container
and
about
30
%
of
the
total
of
the
subsidiaries'
income
is
shifted
to
container.
we,
of
course,
are
using
separate
accounting
as
a
measuring
standard,
but
this
has
been
approved
by
this
court
in
the
norfolk
and
hans
rees
cases
and
considered
by
the
court
in
moorman
and
exxon
as
usable
standards
where
the
taxpayer
introduces
evidence
explaining
why
the
formula
produces
an
unfair
result.
we
have
introduced
that
evidence
in
this
case
by
showing
lower
payrolls
and
higher
profits
in
the
most
profitable
subsidiaries,
those
in
venezuela
and
colombia,
because
of
the
difference
in
political
and
economic
environment
as
between
those
countries
and
the
united
states.
furthermore,
we
are
not
using
separate
accounting
in
this
case
purely
as
an
internal
measure
to
determine
profitability.
we
were
required
to
use
separate
accounting,
or
at
least
the
foreign
subsidiaries
were,
by
the
countries
in
which
they
operate,
so
that
standard
is
set
up
by
those
countries
and
it
is
the
custom
of
nations
to
use
separate
accounting
as
i
will
mention
in
a
moment.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
they
did
not,
your
honor.
they
did
not.
they
certainly
required
it,
however,
in
venezuela
and
colombia.
we
also
maintain
that
california's
worldwide
method
violates
the
commerce
clause
because
it
leads
to
double
taxation,
both
inherently
and
in
this
case.
there
is
a
clear
case
of
double
taxation
here.
california,
by
applying
an
apportionment
method,
is
taxing
income
in
part
which
foreign
countries,
through
separate
accounting,
has
taxed
in
full.
this
is
similar
in
effect
to
the
japan
line
case
where
japan
was
taxing
the
property,
container,
in
full
in
japan
and
california,
by
an
apportionment
method,
was
taxing
them
in
part.
there
is
no
question
that
double
taxation
has
occurred
on
the
facts.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
they
do
not
allow
a
credit
or
any
deduction
for
taxes
paid
in
foreign
countries.
so,
as
far
as
they
are
concerned,
it
is
irrelevant.
as
i
said,
the
subsidiaries
filed
returns
in
these
countries
on
a
separate
accounting
basis
and
paid
the
tax
thereon.
the
board
took
separate
accounting
income,
book
separate
accounting
income,
which
is
very
close
to
taxable
separate
accounting
income,
and
included
that
separate
accounting
income
in
the
tax
base
with
container's
income
and
apportioned
part
of
it
to
california.
the
deficiency
in
this
case
results
from
that
direct
action.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
that
is
not
included
in
container's
income
insofar
as
california
is
concerned,
because
the
commerical
domocile
is
in
chicago.
i
might
mention,
however,
that
california
has
a
special
statute
which
states
that
to
the
extent
dividends
are
paid
to
a
company
with
a
commerical
domocile
outside
of
california
the
interest
deductions
of
the
corporation
are
reduced
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis.
so,
california
does
take
those
separate
dividends
into
account.
the
japan
line
case
noted
that
in
the
field
of
foreign
commerce
as
compared
to
interstate
commerce
double
taxation,
even
though
small
in
amount,
is
a
special
problem
that
would
invalidate
a
state
tax.
this
is
not
a
case
of
the
possibility
of
double
taxation,
double
taxation
has
actually
occurred
because
of
california's
method,
therefore,
we
maintain
it
is
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause.
finally,
we
maintain
that
the
worldwide
unitary
method
impairs
the
ability
of
the
united
states
to
speak
with
one
voice.
double
taxation
here
illustrates
the
problem
through
the
internal
revenue
code
and
the
tax
treaties
entered
into
by
the
united
states
and
many
major
foreign
trading
powers.
a
system
has
been
worked
out
for
avoiding
double
taxation;
that
is
the
separate
accounting
arm's-length
method.
it
avoids
double
taxation
in
this
case.
this
court
long
ago
recognized
that
the
federal
government,
not
the
states,
must
predominate
in
the
field
of
foreign
relations.
japan
line
is
a
recent
case
upholding
that.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
it
is
delaware
headquartered
in
illinois.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
a
british
parent
company?
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
california
treats...
it
applies
the
unitary
method
to
all
multinational
corporations
whether
the
parent
is
headquartered
in
the
united
states
or
in
a
foreign
country.
as
i
understand
your
question--
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
--if
the
british
company
is
an
english,
united
kingdom
corporation
with
a
subsidiary
operating
in
california,
california
would
apply
the
unitary
method
there
also.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
they
would
apply
it,
yes,
in
that
situation.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
well,
i
would
say
in
regard
to
the
treaty,
your
honor,
there
was...
a
majority
of
the
senate
voted
in
favor
of
the
treaty
retaining
that
provision,
but
a
two-thirds
majority
did
not.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
and,
in
the
legislative
history
to
that
treaty,
there
is
considerable
indication
that
many
senators
were
concerned
that
this
problem
should
not
be
taken
up
by
congress
through
the
treaty
mechanism,
but
it
should
go
to
both
houses
of
congress.
so,
i
think
it
is
an
inconclusive
determination
as
to
what
the
senate
meant.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
it
is
a
negative
indicator.
on
the
other
hand,
the
foreign
governments,
as
evidenced
by
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case,
and
have
complained
continuously
about
the
unitary
method.
i
think
the
united
kingdom
is
continuing
to
complain.
as
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
there
was
a
recent
parliamentary
debate
in
which
they
indicated
that
they
had
an
understanding
that
something
was
to
be
done
about
the
problem
and
nothing
has
been
done
and
a
threat
of
retaliation--
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
--i
was
going
to
mention
that
very
point,
your
honor.
the
solicitor
general
did
advise
this
court
in
the
chicago
bridge
case--
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
--that
in
their
view
the
worldwide
unitary
method
as
imposed
by
the
states
does
impair
the
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
carry
out
its
foreign
policy.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
no,
he
did
not,
your
honor.
he
said
that
it
applied
to
u.s.
based--
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
--just
this
kind
of
a
case,
because
chicago
bridge
presents
just
this
kind
of
a
case.
i
will
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
just
a
few
things
in
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
thank
you.
one
thing
in
regard
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
there
is
simply
no
question
that
he
applied...
his
brief
applies
both
to
u.s.
based
companies
and
foreign
based
companies.
he
says
so--
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
--his
submission
in
the
chicago
bridge
case.
mr.
franklin
c.
latcham
that
is
right,
your
honor,
which
certainly
represents
the
position
of
the
united
states
on
this
question
of
worldwide
unitary
apportionment.
and,
it
is
perfectly
clear.
he
says
in
his
brief,
"if,
as
we
submit,
the
court
concludes
that
the
illinois
combined
reporting
requirement,
either,
(a)
creates
a
substantial
risk
of
international
multiple
taxation,
or,
(b)
impairs
federal
uniformity
in
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations.
"
"that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
and
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
"
that,
of
course,
applies
to
a
u.s.
based
company.
the
record
in
the
case...
incidentally,
the
solicitor
general
has
questioned
how...
the
deputy
attorney
general
has
stated
that
the
record
isn't
clear
how
the
tax
returns
were
filed
in
the
foreign
countries,
but
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
page
72,
paragraph
140,
of
the
joint
appendix
that
says:
"the
returns
were
filed",
and
these
were
the
returns
by
the
subsidiaries
"taking
into
account
only
the
applicable
income
and
deductions
incurred
by
the
subsidiary
or
subsidiaries
in
that
country
and
not
taking
into
account
the
income
and
deductions
of
cca
or
the
subsidiaries
operating
in
other
countries.
"
mr.
gobar
has
also
suggested
that
maybe
the
record
isn't
clear
on
the
payment
of
taxes
by
these
subsidiaries.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
joint
appendix,
page
84,
where,
for
the
most
part,
and
i
mean
in
90
%
of
the
cases,
the
actual
taxes
paid
by
the
subsidiaries
are
set
forth.
so
there
is
no
question
about
the
actual
taxes
being
paid.
in
a
few
instances,
it
shows
the
provision
for
taxes
set
up
on
the
books,
but
those
are
distinctly
a
minority
and
certainly
subject
to
the
trusted
nfa.
i
think
the
facts,
and
mr.
gobar
has
mentioned
something
about
the
facts,
i
think
the
facts
are
clear
and
i
needn't
dwell
on
them
any
longer.
i
will
stand
on
our
factual
statement.
the
question
of
whether
congress
should
act
in
the
area,
here
we
have
presented
to
the
court
issues
that
this
court
has
resolved
many,
many
times,
double
taxation,
due
process,
distortion
problems,
the
unitary
question,
those
are
all
issues
that
this
court
has
addressed
recently
and
in
many
times
in
the
past
and
i
would
submit
that
they
shouldn't
be
addressed
again.
i
think
this
is
clearly
a
case
where
california
is
overreaching.
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
taxing
income
earned
outside
the
state
and,
indeed,
outside
the
country
in
foreign
countries.
and,
there
is
no
reason
why
this
corporation
should
have
to
pay
additional
taxes
simply
because
it
is
engaged
in
foreign
commerce.
that
is
certainly
contrary
to
the
constitution.
thank
you,
your
honor.
