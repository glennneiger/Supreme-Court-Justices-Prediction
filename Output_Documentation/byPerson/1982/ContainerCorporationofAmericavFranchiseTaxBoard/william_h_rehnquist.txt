mr.
latcham--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there
were
no
administrative
proceedings
within
the
california
state
tax
system
prior
to
this
that
were
contested?
i
mean,
was
the
record
stipulated
at
the
administrative
stage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
is
the
stipulation...
had
there
been
depositions?
i
am
curious
to
know.
for
instance,
if
i
were
a
state
tax
collection
agency
employee
and
all
of
the
information
were
in
the
possession
largely
of
the
taxpayer...
how
would
you
go
about
stipulating?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
total
amount
of
tax
in
controversy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
difference
california
says
it
can
tax
you
and
what
you
say
california
can
tax
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
is
for
three
years?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
suggesting
it
is
just
as
if
container
had
invested
in
a
chain
of
hotels
in
south
america?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
venezuela
and
colombia
didn't
require
you
to
use
separate
accounting
in
california,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
definition
of
double
taxation
is
a
tax
bill
that
exceeds
your
entire
income?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
in
a
property
tax
concept,
it
was
more
sensible
really,
because
you
could
talk
about
a
specific
piece
of
property
having
a
situs
in
one
state
being
taxed,
two
separate
things,
but
i
am
not
sure
how
much
sense
the
term
itself
means
when
you
talk
about
income
tax.
