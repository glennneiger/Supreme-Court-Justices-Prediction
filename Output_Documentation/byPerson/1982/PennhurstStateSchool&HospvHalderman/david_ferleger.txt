mr.
david
ferleger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondents
that
this
court
should
not
rewrite
sovereign
immunity,
pendent
jurisdiction,
and
comity
law
so
that
the
petitioners
can
win
in
this
court
a
political
battle
they
lost
time
and
again
in
the
pennsylvania
legislature
and
in
the
pennsylvania
courts.
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
reminds
me
of
what
the
attorney
general
said
the
first
day
of
the
pennhurst
trial.
he
said,
"the
commonwealth,
quite
simply,
is
not
defending
pennhurst.
"
certainly
the
abuse
and
dangers
of
pennhurst
are
as
egregious.
the
violations
of
state
law
are
as
clear
today
as
they
were
then
and
the
denial
of
habilitation
is
equally
clear.
the
relief
is
the
issue
here,
apparently,
not
the
liability.
we
have
not
heard
a
word
from
petitioners
defending
the
violations--
mr.
david
ferleger
--pennsylvania
law,
your
honor,
forbids
unnecessary
institutionalization,
forbids
abuse,
and
forbids
denial
of
habilitation.
exactly
what
pennsylvania
law
forbids,
these
defendants
have
done.
in
the
words
of
larson,
these
defendants
are
not
doing
the
business
that
the
sovereign
has
entrusted
them.
mr.
david
ferleger
no
it
is
not
automatically
enough.
but
if
they
act
against
the
authority
of
the
law...
if
they
act
outside
their
authority...
it
is
a
very
clear
and
definite,
not
only
violation,
but
an
action
of
the
sovereign
that
becomes
nonsovereign.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did,
your
honor.
these
defendants
were
acting
in
a
way
that
the
sovereign
had
forbidden
them
to
act.
for
16
years
pennsylvania
law
has
been
clear.
in
the
1966
act,
decisions
of
trial
courts,
regulations--
mr.
david
ferleger
--if
it
was
a
case
of
mistake,
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
story.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
regime
at
pennhurst
that
is
lawless
in
the
extreme
under
state
law.
we
are
not
simply
talking
about
one
mistake--
mr.
david
ferleger
--on
this
point,
your
honor,
there
is
not,
and
the
findings
of
fact,
the
law,
the
conditions
at
pennhurst
have
never
been
challenged.
these
defendants
did
not
petition
for
certiorari
on
the
state
law
issue.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
do
not
think
so.
let
me
tell
you
why.
the
reason
is
that
our
point
on
this
state
law
issue
is
that
these
officials,
whatever
their
bounds
of
discretion,
were
acting
outside
those
bounds
of
discretion,
and
that
that
brings
this
case
to
that
part
of--
mr.
david
ferleger
--well,
with
regard
to
conditions
at
pennhurst,
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
dispute
at
the
trial,
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
dispute
to
this
point.
these
officials
were
acting
in
a
way
that
pennsylvania
law
absolutely
forbids.
and,
under
larson
and
under
treasure
salvors,
both
opinions,
this
kind
of
action
was
totally
unjustified
under
state
law.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
in
that
situation,
we
feel
that
the
federal
questions
that
are
involved
in
this
case
under
article
iii
make
this
case
an
issue...
a
case
to
be
decided
by
the
federal
court.
the
source
of
the
law--
mr.
david
ferleger
--that
is
right.
the
source
of
the
law
makes
no
difference
to
the
relief
that
the
court
can
grant.
in
stern
v.
south--
mr.
david
ferleger
--the
federal
questions
in
the
case--
mr.
david
ferleger
--no
federal
statute...
the
constitutional
provisions
that
are
being
violated
are
those
provisions
against
unnecessary
institutionalization,
parham
and
vitech,
those
provisions--
mr.
david
ferleger
--i
am
talking
about
the
14th
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
david
ferleger
well,
parham
v.
j.r.
and
vitech
in
this
court
have
held
that
unnecessary
institutionalization
is
forbidden
under
the
14th
amendment.
also,
your
honor--
mr.
david
ferleger
--no.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
were
substantial
federal
questions
involved
that
gave
the
court
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
actual
violation
of
the
federal
provisions.
that
is
correct.
but,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
case
under
article
iii,
once
you
have
a
substantial
federal
question...
in
this
case
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
federal
questions
are
substantial...
extends
to--
mr.
david
ferleger
--we
have
substantial
federal
questions--
mr.
david
ferleger
--we
have
substantial
federal
questions
in
this
case.
mr.
david
ferleger
in
terms
of
the
plaintiff's
claims
against
the
defendants...
i
want
to
make
sure--
mr.
david
ferleger
--our
claims
against
the
defendants
as
of
today...
the
substantial
federal
claims...
are
those
of
our
interest,
to
be
free
from
abuse,
to
be
free
from
unnecessary
institutionalization,
and
to
receive
conditions
of
confinement
that
have
some
reasonable
relationship
to
the
purpose,
which
is
habilitation
of
the
confinement.
those
are
substantial
federal
questions,
which
give
the
court
jurisdiction
over
the
pendent
state
claims.
mr.
david
ferleger
we
do
not
need
the
state
statute,
but
because
of
the
principles
announced
by
this
court,
because
of
the
substantial
interest
in
federalism,
the
federal
courts
turn
first
to
the
state
law
violations
before
they
need
to
reach
the
federal
constitutional
violations.
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
state
law
is
the
grounds
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
opinion
does
not
affect
the
remedy
that
can
be
granted.
a
federal
court
can
grant
a
remedy
against
state
officials
even
on
state
law
grounds
so
long...
and
i
agree
with
the
petitioners
on
this
point...
as
it
is
a
prospective
remedy.
the
fact
that
the
remedy
might
cost
money
under
milliken
is
no
reason
to
deny
jurisdiction
entirely.
the
prospective
remedy
in
this
case
was
a
justifiable
remedy
and
not
an
abusive
discretion.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
federal
constitutional
and
the
federal
statutory
issues--
mr.
david
ferleger
--yes,
and
this
case
would
continue.
pennhurst,
as
the
court
is
not
aware,
now
has
about
half
the
residents
it
did
at
the
time
of
the
trial...
many
more
residents...
the
defendants
are
already
in
the
process
of
planning
to
move,
including
nicholas
romeo,
who
was
a
plaintiff
before
this
case
before.
he
has
a
cla
that
is
prepared
for
him.
he
will
be
leaving
shortly.
but,
in
this
case,
we
have
substantial
federal
interest.
the
federal
courts
avoided
imposing
its
own
constitutional
views
on
the
state
because
of
16
years
of
very
clear
decision
by
the
state
courts
leading
up
to
the
in
re
schmidt
case
that
adopt
normalization
principles,
that
adopt
very
clearly
the
right
of
people
to
live
consistent
with
their
treatment
needs
in
as
normal
conditions
as
possible.
mr.
david
ferleger
we
won
on
that
issue
in
the
district
court,
and
i
certainly
would
go
forward.
i
have--
mr.
david
ferleger
--your
honor,
aside--
mr.
david
ferleger
--i
would,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
to
begin
again
in
the
state
courts
with
the
backlogs
that
that
would
involve
with
difficulties
of
jurisdiction,
whether
we
go
to
the
pennsylvania
commonwealth
court
or
to
the
five
county
courts,
those
difficulties...
the
delays
that
would
involve...
would
require
either
that
we
obtain
a
preliminary
injunction
from
the
federal
court
and
proceed
in
two
courts
at
the
same
time,
which
gibbs'
counsel
is
against,
or
that
we
accept
the
delay
and
the
continued
suffering
of
the
600
people
who
remain
at
pennhurst.
and,
that
is
a
decision
that
i
would
not
make.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
third
circuit
usually
takes
about
three
months
from
time
of
argument
to
a
decision--
mr.
david
ferleger
--they
are
up
to
date.
they
are
current.
mr.
david
ferleger
on
remand
from
this
court
we
briefed
both
the
constitutional
and
the
state
law
issues
and
urged
the
court
to
reach
only
the
state
law
issues.
is
this
court...
is
probably
not
aware
pennsylvania
never
had
sovereign
immunity.
pennsylvania
never
asserted
sovereign
immunity
to
any
sort
of
law
suit.
it
was
not
until
a
1978
statute
that
for
the
first
time
sovereign
immunity
existed
in
pennsylvania.
that
statute
came
after
the
judgment
in
this
case.
federal
court
immunity
in
pennsylvania
was
not
mentioned
by
statute
until
1980.
that
is
the
statute
cited
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
david
ferleger
this
is
an
issue
not
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
do
not
recall
that
it
was
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
want
to
turn,
in
my
minute
or
two
remaining,
to
the
mootness
issue.
we
believe
that
the
termination
of
the
master
not
only
moots
the
master
issue
but
it
affects
the
rest
of
the
case
as
well.
the
masters
have
never
supervised
anything.
the
august
12,
1982
opinion
by
the
district
court
tries
to
say
what
it
had
said
earlier.
the
master's
job
was
only
to
monitor
implementation.
that
was
the
sole
job
of
the
master.
it
is
explained
in
the
august
12th
opinion
that
is
in
the
appendix,
and
that
order
appointing
the
special
master
is
now
terminated.
as
to
the
hearing
master
who
was
not
appointed
until
april,
1980,
that
order
was
never
appealed
by
any
party.
it
is
not
before
this
court.
there
is
no
record
before
this
court
on
what
the
hearing
master
does,
or
even
who
he
is.
so,
that
the
hearing
master
issue
certainly
is
nothing
for
this
court.
and,
i
want
to
point
out--
mr.
david
ferleger
--i
believe
that
the
united
states
federal
courts
would
be
immune,
ironically,
from
any
suit
to
recover
the
fees.
the
fees--
mr.
david
ferleger
--but,
there
is
no
place
from
which
the
fees
can
be
returned,
is
my
point.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
commonwealth
paid
money
into
the
federal
courts
registry.
the
federal
court
used
the
money
as
ordered
by
the
federal
court
to
pay
the
masters.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
don't
think
there
is
any
fund
available
for
the
federal
courts
to
do
that.
there
may
be,
but
i
don't
believe
there
is.
mr.
david
ferleger
the
recipients
are
vendors,
sales
people,
stationery
stores,
employees--
mr.
david
ferleger
--no.
the
money
that
was
paid
out
by
the
master's
office
was
a
budget
for
an
office
to
employees,
to
various
vendors
and
sales
people.
mr.
david
ferleger
they
received
their
weekly
salary.
mr.
david
ferleger
i
am
not
certain
that
it
could
because
of
the
immunity--
mr.
david
ferleger
--if
there
is
a
fund
for
which
the
money
can
be
returned.
i
don't
believe
there
is.
the
orders
appointing
the
masters,
i
should
point
out,
page
218a
of
the
appendix,
are
in
the
process
of
being
revised
by
the
district
court
in
any
event...
the
order
appointing
the
hearing
masters...
so
that
i
believe
that
the
special
master's
termination,
the
fact
that
all
the
orders
in
this
court
are
now
in
the
lower
court
are
being
revised,
justify
a
finding
of
both
mootness
and
this
court's
decision
not
to
reach
the
other
issues
in
the
case
as
well.
mr.
david
ferleger
yes.
the
reason
was
when
the
master
was
appointed,
your
honor,
the
state
had
refused
to
come
forward
with
any
plan
to
implement
the
relief
that
was
ordered
by
the
court.
so
that
until
1982,
when
the
state
finally
agreed
to
do
certain
things,
the
federal
court
was
forced
to
do
the
extra
monitoring.
mr.
david
ferleger
only
monitoring,
but
the
monitoring
that
the
defendants
should
have
done
they
didn't
agree
to
do
until
1982.
thank
you.
