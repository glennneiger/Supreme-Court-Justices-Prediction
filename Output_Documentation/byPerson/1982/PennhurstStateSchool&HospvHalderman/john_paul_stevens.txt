justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
go
back
if
i
may.
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
about
the
two
green
cases
that
judge
seitz
relied
upon
in
the
third
circuit.
you
said
they
have
been
implicitly
overruled
by
edelman
against
jordan,
is
that
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
the
holding
is
inconsistent
with--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
your
answer...
i
still
want
to
be
sure,
your
answer
is
that
they
have
been
implicitly
overruled
by
edelman
against
jordan.
my
next
question
is
how
could
cases
that
turn
on
state
law
claim
be
overruled
by
edelman
against
jordan
which
did
not
involve
the
state
law
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
vice
versus
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
equally...
the
converse
would
equally
be
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
become
barred
simply
because
it
is
a
pendent
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question
to
be
sure
i
get
your
theory
correctly?
supposing
we
had
before
us
both
the
federal
claim
and
the
state
claim...
either
federal
statute
or
federal
constitution,
i
would
not
care...
but
both
asking
for
precisely
the
same
relief
that
you
are
discussing
here.
insofar
as
the
claim
relied
on
federal
law,
in
your
view,
would
it
be
a
claim
against
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
does
not
answer
my
question.
my
question
is,
insofar
as
it
relied
on
federal
law,
would
the
claim
be
a
claim
against
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
they
ask
for
precisely
the
same
relief
they
ask
under
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
are
saying
they
could
maintain
the
claim,
but
i
am
asking
you
as
a
matter
of
analysis
whether,
in
your
view,
it
would
be
a
claim
against
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
saying
that
ex
parte
young
in
essence
holds,
even
though
it
is
a
claim
against
the
state,
it
may
be
maintained
notwithstanding
the
11th
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
practical
consequence
this
is
with
a
mixed
claim,
it
would
be
the
duty,
in
your
view,
of
the
federal
court
to
address
the
federal
claim
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
precisely
at
what
stage
of
the
proceedings
did
your
clients
raise
the
11th
amendment
objection
to
the
pendent
state
law
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
had
it
been
raised
before
we
looked
at
the
case
two
years
ago
and
said...
told
the
third
circuit
to
look
at
the
state
law
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
was
the
argument
you
are
making
today
first
raised?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
how
did
you...
just
in
your
brief
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
you
never
filed
a
motion
to
strike
the
state
law
claims
entirely
in
the
district
court,
for
example?
you
never
tried
to
separate
those
out.
