justice
byron
r.
white
and,
why
it
is
barred?
because
it
is
against
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
really
aren't
saying
that
the
11th
amendment
always
bars
the
adjudication
in
the
federal
court
of
a
pendent
claim
where
the
nominal
defendants...
or
where
the
defendants
are
state
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
say...
you
are
saying
it
always
bars
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defendants
here
are
state
officials?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
have
to
get
to
some
more...
you
must
say
something
else
about
the
11th
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
it
must
be
then
considered
a
suit
against
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
if
the
argument
only
is
whether
the
officer
is
properly
carrying
out
his
duties,
duties
which
he
has
the
authority
to
perform--
justice
byron
r.
white
--then
it
is
a
suit
against
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
what
if
the
court
alleged
that
the
state
official
had
no
authority
whatsoever
to
do
what
he
is
doing?
it
is
just
outside
the
perimeter
of
his
duties.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
this
state...
this
case
doesn't
get
into
that
ring?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
would
say
even
if
this
were
a
federal
claim
that
the
relief
granted
in
this
case
would
be
barred
by
the
11th
amendment
in
a
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
edelman
v.
jordan
would
not
bar
that
kind
of
relief
granted
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is...
so
you
do
say
that
the
11th
amendment
should
apply
differently
to
a
federal
claim
and
to
a
state
pendent
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
probably
missed
it,
but
if
we
did
not
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
11th
amendment,
would
the
case
be
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
issue
is
whether
this
suit
is
maintainable
in
the
federal
court
on
this
state
ground.
now
what
allegations
are
the
error
claims
as
to
how
the
state
officials
are
or
are
not
exceeding
their
authority
or
making
a
mistake
in
application
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
have
the
authority
in
general
to
take
care
of
these
patients
and
if
they
just
make
a
mistake
in
the
administration
of
the
law
or
fail
to
abide
by
some
provision
of
law,
you
think
that
is
automatically
enough
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
it
clear
that
that
was
their
deal?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
pennsylvania
law
says
you
shall
not
be
cruel
to
patients,
and
some
court
says,
well,
you
were
cruel.
and,
the
doctor
or
administrator
says,
well
i
wasn't
cruel.
and,
the
court
says,
well,
yes
you
were.
well,
he
says,
i
guess
i
made
a
mistake--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
mean
there
is
not
two
sides
to
the
argument
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
nonfrivolous
arguments
on
the
other
side
to
the
effect
that
these
officers
were
not
breaking
the
law.
of
course,
it
has
been
held
they
were.
but,
if
there
were
nonfrivolous
arguments
on
the
other
side,
would
you
not
think
that
the
11th
amendment
would
bar
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
officials
were
just
lawless,
absolutely
knowingly
lawless?
any
fool
should
have
known?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
we
reversed
on
the
11th
amendment
grounds,
would
you
really
go
forward
with
the
case
on
federal
constitutional
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
your
submission
is
that...
and
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
agree
with
you...
that
the
pennsylvania
officials
are
just
way
out
of
bounds,
and
that
you
could
get
relief
in
the
state
courts
on
state
law
grounds,
apparently,
you
would
think
from
what
you
say,
with
very,
very
little
trouble.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
would
press
the
third
circuit
on
the
constitutional
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
far
behind
is
the
third
circuit,
or
is
it
up
to
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
reaching--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
have
argued
the
federal
issues
in
that
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
just
curious,
if
the
only
duty
the
special
master
was
to
monitor...
it
needed
employees
and
it
needed
to
pay
out
a
lot
of
things
to
vendors
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
special
master
at
one
point
had
much
wider
duties
than
mere
monitoring?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
the
court
had
the
power
it
had
to
exercise
it,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know
whether
you
just
call
it
comity
or
the
option--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
option
not
to
decide
a
state
law
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
constitutional
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
is
necessarily
part
of
the
ashwander
rule,
not
only
to
decide
state
issues
first
but
to
decline
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue?
