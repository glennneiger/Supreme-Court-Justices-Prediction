justice
william
h.
rehnquist
edelman
did
involve
just
a
federal
statutory
claim
with
what
relief
was
ultimately
granted
on
it,
wasn't
it?
it
was
not
a
state
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
authority
for
that
last
proposition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
appointment
of
the
master
is
not
improper,
i
take
it
the
state
could
probably
recover
whatever
was
paid
to
the
master.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
ferleger,
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that
there
were
14th
amendment
violations
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
an
accurate
answer
to
justice
marshall's
question
that
there
are
no
federal
law
violations
actually
found
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
an
alternate
ground
for
affirming
the
third
circuit?
the
third
circuit
treated
this
as
just
a
standard
11th
amendment
type
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
brief
it
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
sir,
about
the
special
master...
so
long
as
the
propriety
of
his
appointment
is
being
challenged,
the
fact
that
he
stopped
serving
would
not
moot
it
because
i
would
think
there
could
be
recovery
of
his
fees.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
the
federal
court
could
order
the
return
of
his
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
masters
who
were
paid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
presume
if
the
district
court
were
told
by
a
higher
court
that
it
had
to
refund
the
money
to
the
state,
the
district
court
would
do
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
the
district
court
would
then
call
upon
the
recipients
of
the
fees
to
reimburse
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
masters
are
vendors
and
stationery
stores?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
the
masters
themselves
receive
some
sort
of
compensation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
i
presume
that
could
be
ordered
returned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
a
district
court
is
told
by
a
higher
court
to
order
it
returned,
there
is
no
difficulty
with
that
ministerial
act
in
the
district
court,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
that
is
a
pendent
federal
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
pendent
state
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gilhool?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
district
court
passed
on
all
three
of
these
on
both
the
federal
statutory,
the
state
statutory--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--did
it
first
reach
the
state
statutory
grounds?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
did
it
reach
first?
i
would
think--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
isn't
that
a
departure
from
what
you
call
the
hoarytradition?
if
you
decide
a
statutory
issue,
you
don't
reach
the
constitutional
issue?
