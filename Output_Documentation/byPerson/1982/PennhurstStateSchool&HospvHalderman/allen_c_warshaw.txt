mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
court.
if
i
may
i
will
address
the
comity
issue
first
and
then
the
master
issue
including
the
mootness
issue.
obviously,
if
you
agree
with
us
that
the
11th
amendment
bars
a
decision
on
the
state
law
issues
in
this
case,
you
need
go
no
further.
however,
even
if
the
11th
amendment
permits
such
claims,
principles
of
comity
do
not.
rather,
those
principles
prohibit
a
decision
based
solely
on
state
law
when
the
likely
result
with
be
a
federal
court
order
requiring
expenditure
of
state
funds
and
controlling
the
operation
of
state
programs
solely
to
implement
state
laws.
in
this
regard,
essentially
three
principles
apply.
first,
federal
courts
must
display
a
strict
regard
for
the
independence
of
state
government.
second,
they
must
avoid
needless
friction
with
a
state's
domestic
policies.
third,
they
must
be
reluctant
to
interfere
with
the
fiscal
operations
of
a
state.
and,
in
addition,
i
would
note
that
this
court
has
recently
counseled
federal
courts
to
show
a
substantial
deference
to
the
judgments
of
qualified
professionals
chosen
by
a
state
to
operate
its
mental
retardation
systems.
each
of
these
principles
was
violated
in
this
case
by
the
third
circuit
as
it
apparently
solely
or
primarily,
for
reasons
of
federal
court
convenience,
sanctioned
a
massive
and
ongoing
intrusion
into
pennsylvania's
domestic
policies,
its
fiscal
operations
and
the
judgments
of
its
qualified
mental
retardation
professionals.
specifically,
in
this
case
the
lower
courts
have
taken
a
vague
right
to
treatment
in
the
least
restrictive
environment,
and
have
assumed
the
power
to
apply
it
in
over
a
thousand
cases.
more
importantly,
they
have
taken
this
supposed
right
from
state
cases
involving
one
person
where
funding
was
not
an
issue
and
have
tried
to
apply
it
on
a
state-wide
basis
where
limited
resources
required
difficult
choices
between
competing
needs,
rights,
and
priorities.
in
short,
the
court
has
essentially
taken
control
of
pennsylvania's
$160
million
community
program
for
the
mentally
retarded.
for
example,
in
july
of
1982,
well
after
the
third
circuit
had
held
that
its
orders
were
based
solely
on
state
law,
the
district
court
roundly
condemned
commonwealth
officials
for
their
failure
to
place
more
plaintiff
class
members
in
clas.
it
found
wholly
unacceptable...
and
i
quote
its
word...
the
state
officials
excuse
and
explanation
that
they
had
expended
available
funds
moving
the
residents
of
another
institution
into
clas.
in
so
doing
it
apparently
found
entirely
irrelevant
uncontroverted
evidence,
testimony
by
a
number
of
state
officials,
that
the
reason
they
had
given
priority
to
the
other
institution
was
that
its
conditions
were
dangerously
deteriorating.
it
was
about
to
lose
federal
approval,
and
it
was
about
to
lose
substantial
federal
funding.
in
contrast,
pennhurst
at
that
time
and
today
has
full
federal
approval,
meets
all
applicable
federal
standards,
and
receives
substantial
federal
funding.
more
recently,
the
court
has
ordered
the
state
to
place
over
270
class
members
in
clas.
it
has
done
so
despite
clear
evidence
that
anticipating
funding
would
not
be
sufficient
to
fund
those
placements.
it
also
ignored
testimony
by
state
officials
that
there
were
simply
priorities
in
the
mental
retardation
area
that
should
have
been
given
higher
priority.
thus,
the
district
court
has
imposed
its
policy,
fiscal
and
professional
judgment
on
defendants
in
a
way
which
is
given
precedence
to
its
decree
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
competing
interests
in
pennsylvania.
moreover,
it
has
done
so
without
any
regard
for
the
many
other
mentally
retarded
people
in
pennsylvania
whose
right
is
presumably
identical
and
whose
need
was
apparently
greater.
this
already
massive
intrusion
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
appointment
of
masters,
who
over
a
five-year
period
at
a
cost
of
over
$3
million
have
monitored
and
supervised
in
detail
and
on
a
daily
basis
the
operation
of
pennsylvania's
programs
for
the
mentally
retarded.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
the
hearing
master...
one
of
the
masters
has
not
stopped,
is
the
first
level
answer
to
that.
in
fact,
there
is
a
hearing
master
in
place
who
resolves
all
disputes
concerning
community
placements.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
that
would
be
our
feeling.
and,
at
the
very
least
there
is
a
contempt
citation
which
is
pending
before
this
court,
if
money
is
still
at
issue.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
by
the
master?
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
there
has
been
no
question.
we
have
paid
up
until
the
time
that
the
legislature
expressed
its
will
and
forbade
us
from
paying
state
monies
for
that
purpose,
which
is
the
subject
of
a
contempt
also
pending
before
the
court.
i
believe
it
is
81-2363
in
a
cert
petition
which
is
pending.
yes,
there
have
been
substantial
monies
at
issue,
and
at
least
judge
garth
in
the
lower
court
recognized
that
should
we
prevail
on
the
master
issue,
we
would
certainly
be
entitled,
in
a
very
real
way,
to
the
$300,000
which
are
still
in
the
custody
of
the
district
court
as
a
result
of
the
contempt
fines.
moreover,
i
should
note
that
there
are
requests
pending
in
the
district
court
to
reinstate
the
master.
and,
in
fact,
throughout
the
course
of
this
litigation,
there
have
been
so
many
disputes
over
implementation,
i
cannot
imagine
that
if
this
case
were
to
be
remanded
in
its
present
form
that
the
district
court
would
not
be
asked
on
a
repeated
basis
to
reinstate
the
now
defunct
special
master.
but,
i
once
again
would
contend,
the
issues
are
identical
as
to
the
special
master
and
the
hearing
master,
and
we
believe
they
are
still
alive
through
the
hearing
master
and
through
the
fines
which
are
being
held
in
the
district
court.
mr.
allen
c.
warshaw
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
it
would
be,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
you
have
to
reach
the
comity
issue
or
the
master
issue
if
the
court
should
not
have
based
its
orders
at
all
on
state
law.
now,
i
would
also
note
in
relation
to
the
master
issue
that
this
is
something
that
at
best
is
necessary
under
extraordinary
circumstances.
yet,
in
this
case
the
court
has
utilized
these
masters
to
supervise
a
community
placement
program
which
even
respondents
conceded
the
last
time
we
were
before
this
court...
at
page
40
of
the
transcript
and
in
addition
at
page
66
of
the
halderman
brief...
was
a
leader
in
the
nation
when
this
case
was
commenced,
and
certainly
the
testimony
at
trial
was
unanimous
on
that
point.
moreover,
as
i
have
noted,
any
argument...
and
this
has
been
made
by
respondents
in
some
respects...
that
the
courts
were
doing
that
which
we
wish
them
to
do
is
belied
by
the
fact
that
the
legislature
explicitly
refused
to
fund
these
masters.
certainly,
the
masters
at
least
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
will
of
pennsylvania's
officials
or
its
legislature.
now
i
think
it
is
our
point
that
this
kind
of
constant
daily
ongoing
intrusion
into
wholly
state
programs,
whether
it
is
accomplished
by
a
court,
by
itself,
or
with
the
assistance
of
masters,
is
the
kind
of
intrusion
that
should
be
undertaken
only
in
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances.
and,
in
this
regard,
i
should
note
that
the
united
states
appears
to
agree
with
us,
insofar
as
we
are
talking
about
the
master.
when,
as
in
this
case,
it
is
based
solely
on
state
law
and
serves
no
federal
purpose
whatsoever,
it
is
an
unacceptable
use
of
the
federal
judicial
power.
it
is
a
use
which
this
court
should
terminate.
thank
you
for
your
consideration.
i
would
like
to
reserve
our
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
