mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
returns
to
this
court
after
a
two-year
absence.
as
the
court
will
recall,
in
1978,
the
district
court,
relying
on
federal
constitutional,
federal
statutory,
and
state
statutory
grounds,
ordered
that
pennhurst
state
school
and
hospital,
a
facility
for
the
mentally
retarded,
be
closed
and
that
all
of
its
residents
be
moved
to
community
living
alternatives
known
as
clas.
on
appeal,
the
third
circuit,
relying
on
the
developmental
disability
act,
the
federal
statute
not
relied
on
by
the
district
court,
essentially
affirmed
the
judgment.
it
did
modify
the
order,
however,
to
allow
some
residents
to
remain
at
pennhurst.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
question
of
mootness,
mr.
chief
justice,
goes
to
the
particular
issue
of
the
special
master
and
alan
warshaw
will
discuss
that
issue.
i
will
discuss
it
first
if
you
would
prefer.
the
third
circuit,
on
the
initial
appeal,
ordered
the
district
court
to
make
individual
determinations
about
the
appropriateness
of
an
improved
pennhurst
for
each
resident.
it
further
ordered
the
district
court
or
master
to
apply
a
presumption
in
favor
of
placing
people
in
cla's
and
said
that
unless
pennhurst
was
the
only
appropriate
place
for
a
resident
cla's
must
be
provided>
["].
this
court
reversed,
finding
that
the
dd
act
did
not
impose
such
massive
obligations
on
the
states.
it
then
remanded
the
case
to
the
third
circuit
for
consideration
of
the
other
issues.
on
remand,
the
third
circuit
issued
exactly
the
same
order,
this
time
resting
its
decision
entirely
on
state
law.
the
court
rejected
our
argument
that
the
11th
amendment
barred
the
order
and,
furthermore,
that
in
the
event
the
11th
amendment
did
not
bar
it,
the
principles
of
comity
should
do
so.
as
a
result
we
believe
that
the
third
circuit
has
expanded
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
at
the
expense
of
state
officials,
state
legislatures,
and
ultimately,
state
courts.
now,
as
i
have
explained,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
particularly
address
the
11th
amendment
issues
on
which
there
is
no
mootness
point,
and
allen
warshaw
will
discuss
the
other
issues.
before
turning
to
the
merits
of
the
11th
amendment
issue,
i
would
like
to
talk
briefly
about
the
relationship
between
the
11th
amendment
and
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction.
for
the
third
circuit,
in
rejecting
our
11th
amendment
argument,
placed
considerable
weight
on
the
fact
that
the
state
law
claim,
on
which
all
of
the
relief
now
rests,
was
a
pendent
claim.
our
position
on
this
issue
is
straightforward.
the
doctrine
of
pendent
jurisdiction
is
not
sufficient
to
override
a
constitutional
bar
like
the
11th
amendment
any
more
than
the
exercise
of
diversity
jurisdiction
or
admiralty
jurisdiction
or
any
other
general
grant
of
jurisdiction
would
be
able
to
do
so.
for
example,
it
would
be
inconceivable
if
the
original
claim
in
chisholm
v.
georgia,
the
very
claim
that
prompted
the
passage
of
the
11th
amendment,
could
now
be
brought
after
the
passage
of
the
11th
amendment
in
federal
court
simply
by
making
it
a
pendent
claim
rather
than
a
diversity
claim
as
it
was
in
chisholm.
without
a
valid
basis
of
jurisdiction
under
article
iii,
of
course,
the
issue
of
the
11th
amendment
is
never
reached,
but
once
valid
jurisdiction
under
article
iii
is
found,
the
question
still
must
be
answered,
is
a
particular
claim
barred
by
the
11th
amendment?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
the
decision
in
green
does
not
ever
address
the
question
specifically,
of
course,
as
to
whether
the
pendent
claim
has
to
be
examined
under
the
11th
amendment.
i
think
that
holding
has
been
seriously
undercut
by
the
holding
in
edelman,
which
the
court
decided
ten
years
ago.
in
edelman
the
court
did
exactly
what
we
are
saying
they
should
do
in
this
case.
it
first
looked
to
see
whether
the
court
properly
exercised
pendent
jurisdiction,
citing
hagans
v.
lavine,
the
leading
case.
it
then,
however,
having
found
that
the
court
did
properly
exercise
pendent
jurisdiction,
went
on
to
conclude
that
the
claim
was
barred
by
the
11th
amendment.
now,
to
the
extent
that
green
is
inconsistent
with
that,
we
think
edelman
is
already
undercut.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is
important
though
to
keep
these
two
issues
separately.
our
position
here
is
that
the
exercise
of
pendent
jurisdiction
does
not
affect
whether
the
claim
is
barred
by
the
11th
amendment.
if
you
find
that
it
is
barred
by
the
11th
amendment,
then
the
exercise
of
pendent
jurisdiction
doesn't
make
any
difference.
now,
the
second
part
of
my
argument,
of
course,
is
that
this
claim,
although
it
is
not
a
federal
statutory
claim,
is
barred
by
the
11th
amendment.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
in
this
particular
case,
yes.
the
short
answer,
and
i
have
a
longer
answer
that
i
will
give,
the
short
answer
is
that
it
is
a
claim
against
the
state
and
it
is
not
taken
outside
of
the
11th
amendment
by
the
unusual
principles
of
ex
parte
young
that
apply
only
when--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no.
i
am
saying
that
it
does
not
always
bar
it
where
the
defendants
are
state
officials.
under
11th
amendment
law--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
defendants
here
are
state
officials
and
there--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
have
lots
more
to
say
about
it,
yes,
your
honor.
but,
the
fact
is,
one
of
the
key
principles,
which
i
will
discuss,
about
the
11th
amendment
is
that
the
fact
that
you
make
state
officials
the
nominal
defendants
doesn't
mean
that
it
isn't
in
practice
a
claim
against
the
state
for
11th
amendment
purposes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
right.
i
think
to
the
extent
you
were
talking
about
the
particular
part
of
green,
which
it
never
really
discusses...
it
never
discusses
the
relationship.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but,
the
holding,
as
it
goes
to
state
officials,
is
inconsistent
with
edelman.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
green
and
siler,
which
is
the
case
that
the
third
circuit
relied
on,
of
course,
didn't
even
discuss
the
11th
amendment
issue.
but,
those
cases
were
decided
at
a
time
when
the
federal
intrusion
into
state
affairs
was
much
greater
than
is
now
recognized
to
be
permissible.
you
know,
we
are
talking
about
a
time
of
substantive
due
process,
lochner
v.
new
york.
those
cases
have
essentially
been
legislatively
overruled
by
the
anti-injunction
acts,
therefore,
the
court
really
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
reconsider
them.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
edelman
v.
jordan,
of
course,
doesn't
discuss
the
issue
of
whether...
i
mean,
does
not
address
the
issue
of
whether
the
particular
claim
at
issue
in
green
would
be
barred
by
the
11th
amendment,
but
it
does
address
the
issue
of
whether
if
a
pendent
claim
is
barred
by
the
11th
amendment
and
i
think
there
are
different
reasons
for
different
types
of
claims.
then,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
pendent
claim
makes
no
difference.
it
is
barred
by
the
11th
amendment
just
as
much
as
if
it
is
a
pendent
claim
as
it
would
be
if
it
was--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
it
was
not
barred
by
the
11th
amendment,
the
fact
that--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
now,
i
obviously
should
get
to
the
11th
amendment
principles
and
while
the
court
has
said
itself
that
its
decisions
in
this
area
are
not
easy
to
reconcile,
i
think
there
are
four
principles
which
are
pretty
clearly
established
by
now.
first
of
all,
the
11th
amendment
does
bar
suits
against
a
state
by
its
own
citizens
as
well
as
by
citizens
of
another
state.
the
court
said
that
in
hans
v.
louisiana.
it
reaffirmed
it
last
term
in
treasure
salvors.
second,
that
the
amendment
also
bars
suits
for
injunctive
relief--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--pardon
me?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct,
justice
brennan.
the
second
principle
is
that
the
amendment
bars
suits,
not
just
for
damages,
but
for
injunctive
relief
as
well.
the
court
reaffirmed
that
principle
last
term
in
cory
v.
white
and
the
language
of
the
11th
amendment
referring
to
any
suit
in
law
or
equity
would
leave
little
doubt.
the
third
principle,
and
the
one
which
justice
white
was
alluding
to
earlier,
the
amendment
bars
suits
against
the
states,
not
just
in
name,
but
in
fact.
although
the
court
took
awhile
to
get
around
to
that
holding,
originally
holding
that
the
state
had
to
be
named
as
a
defendant,
it
is
now
clear,
from
the
cases
of
this
court,
that
the
plaintiffs
could
not
get
around
the
11th
amendment
by
naming
state
officials
as
the
nominal
defendants.
in
such
cases,
as
in
this
one,
the
court
must
look
to
the
nature
of
the
claim
asserted
and
the
nature
of
the
relief
granted
to
determine
whether
the
state
is,
in
fact,
the
real
party
in
interest.
now,
the
fourth
principle
is
the
principle
of
ex
parte
young
which,
where
applicable,
puts
a
limitation
on
the
second
and
third
principles
just
discussed.
according
to
that
principle,
a
federal
court
may
allow
injunctive
relief
against
a
state
official
and
may
do
so
even
if
the
result
is
to
cause
an
expenditure
of
state
funds.
the
reason
for
this
exception,
as
stated
in
young,
is
that
a
state
has
no
power
to
impart
to
a
state
official
any
immunity
from
responsibility
to
the
supreme
authority
of
the
constitution.
thus,
where
there
is
a
conflict
with
the
constitution
or
with
supreme
federal
law,
it
is
not
necessary
to
ask,
as
you
do
in
the
normal
case,
whether
the
state
official
is
acting
within
his
colorable
authority
or
whether
the
impact
of
the
order
is
on
the
state
treasury
because
it
makes
no
difference.
the
state
cannot
confer
an
immunity
from
obedience
to
the
constitution.
now,
while
the
logic
of
ex
parte
young
has
been
questioned,
the
doctrine
of
the
case
has
long
been
thought
necessary
to
the
federal
system,
for
without
it,
the
ability
of
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
federal
rights
would
be
greatly
undercut.
but,
the
doctrine
has
been
severely
limited
to
suit
that
purpose.
for
example,
the
court
has
declined
to
extend
ex
parte
young
to
allow
damages
payable
from
a
state
treasury
even
though
the
claim
is
a
constitutional
one
and
the
logic
of
ex
parte
young
conceivably
could
be
stretched
to
fit
that
case.
here,
there
is
even
less
reason--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--edelman
v.
jordan
and
cases
before
it.
here,
there
is
even
less
reason
to
extend
ex
parte
young
because
the
claim
at
issue
is
not
a
federal
claim
at
all.
it
does
not
involve
any
conflict
with
the
constitution
or
with
supreme
federal
law.
it
involves
only
the
question
whether
the
defendants
are
correctly
carrying
out
their
responsibilities
under
state
law.
that
is
not
the
sort
of
question
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
principles
of
ex
parte
young.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
you
have
to
make
the
examination
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
suit
against
the
state.
in
this
case,
i
think
if
you
apply
the
principles
that
you
do
in
a
normal
case,
it
clearly
is
a
suit
against
the
state.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
a
suit
against
the
state
if
that,
in
fact,
is
what
the
claim
is
and
that
is
what
the
claim
is
here,
that
is
a
suit
against
the
state.
there
obviously
can
be
suits
against
state
officials
that
are
outside--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--the
lesson
of
larson
and
treasure
salvors
last
year
is
that
there
is
some
range
outside
of
colorable
authority
where
you
can't
fairly
say
the
official
is
acting
as
an
official.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
certainly
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it
does
at
all.
you
are
talking
here...
there
isn't
any
question
that
there
is
a
statutory
bar
of
the
type
suggested
in
larson
that
had
to
be
pleaded
in
the
complaint
that
limits
the
power
of
these
officials
to
make
placement
decisions
regarding
institutions
or
cla's
or
any
of
the
professional
decisions
regarding
treatment
of
the
retarded.
the
most
that
the
respondents
say
is
that
they
are
not
carrying
out
their
duties
in
the
way
that
they
should.
but,
the
court
in
larson
has
said
that
a
mere
error
in
the
exercise
of
duties
is
not
enough
to
override
a
governmental
immunity.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
we
certainly
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
distinctions
that
the
court
has
to
look
at
in
deciding
whether
the
suit
is
a
suit
against
the
state.
however,
in
this
case,
even
if
the
court
did
determine
that
it
was
ultra
vires,
we
think
the
court
would
still
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
relief
granted
here.
because
this
is...
the
relief
here
obviously
is
not
going
to
be
paid
for
by
the
individual
defendants.
they
are
not
going
to
create
and
fund
cla's
out
of
their
own
pockets.
and,
the
county
defendants
who
are
here
have
only
administrative
responsibilities.
the
state
will
have
to
pay
every
cent
of
the
costs
required
by
the
order
below.
and,
therefore,
even
if
it
was
regarded
as
outside
the
colorable
authority
of
the
state
officials
as
defendants,
the
relief
ordered
would
still
bring
the
case
back
in
the
class
of
suits
that
are
cases
against
the
state.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
do
not
think
you
have
to
agree
with
every
one
of
the
little
points.
i
think
the
basic
points--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
you
basically
have
to
agree
with
the
point
that
this
is,
in
fact,
a
suit
against
the
state
under
the
accepted
principles
of
these
decisions.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
oh,
absolutely
not.
this
case
is
entirely
consistent
with
ex
parte
young.
now,
what
we
are
saying
is
that
ex
parte
young
is
completely
authoritative
where
it
applies.
and,
where
it
applies
is
when
you
have
a
conflict
with
the
constitution
or
supreme
federal
law.
here
we
do
not
have
that
conflict.
all
you
have
is
an
issue
of
whether
these
state
officials
are
carrying
out
their
duties
properly
under
state
law,
and
that
is
not
the
kind
of
claim
when
any
of
the
immunity
that
is
discussed
in
ex
parte
young
can
be
set
aside.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
insofar
as
the
claim
relied
on
federal
law,
applying
the
principles
of
ex
parte
young,
the
state
could
not
confer
any
immunity
on
the
state
officials.
so,
assuming
it
was
a
state
official
that
was
a
named
defendant,
the
claim
would
be
properly
brought
in
state
court
against
the
state
official
under
federal
law.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
if
it
is...
under
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--as
a
matter
of
analysis,
the
effect
is
the
same
as
it
is
in
the
claim
of
the
state
court.
but,
the
logic
of
ex
parte
young
says
it
does
not
make
any
difference
in
that
case
whether
it
is
the
state--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
is
the
practical
effect
of
ex
parte
young,
yes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
we
are
saying
that
in
this
case
if
the
relief
were
granted
on
a
federal
claim,
that
for
those
purposes
ex
parte
young
would
be
the
controlling
case.
and,
that
does
allow
prospective
relief
against
state
officials.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
edelman
v.
jordan
deals
with
retroactive
relief,
not
prospective
relief.
that
is
correct.
so,
i
would
think
that
edelman
v.
jordan
would
not
bar
relief,
if
the
relief
was
on
a
federal
claim,
which
it
is
not.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
absolutely.
i
think
ex
parte
young
establishes
an
exception
for
federal
claims
that
does
not
apply
to
state
claims
precisely.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
indeed,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
federal
court
to
address
only
the
federal
claim,
because
our
argument
is
that
the
state
claim
must
be
dismissed
under
the
11th
amendment.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
correct.
if...
you
would
not
need
to
say
that
the
claims
are
barred
under
the
11th
amendment
if
you
applied
a
doctrine
of
comity.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
just
a
few
points,
please.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
counsel
seems
to
argue
that
the
11th...
the
14th
amendment
simply
knocks
over
the
11th
amendment
and
then
the
pendent
claims
can
follow
in
behind
it
without
having
been
tested
against
the
11th
amendment
and
he
cites
edelman
for
that
proposition.
edelman,
as
we
discussed
this
morning,
simply
doesn't
stand
for
that
proposition.
the
court
made
exactly
the
inquiry
in
edelman
that
we
say
should
be
made
here,
whether
the
particular
claim
at
issue
was
barred
by
the
11th
amendment.
for
the
prospective
relief
in
edelman,
the
court
found
that
that
claim
was
not
barred
by
the
11th
amendment
under
the
principles
of
ex
parte
young
which
applied
to
that
claim.
for
the
claim
that
dealt
with
retroactive
relief,
it
found
that
it
was
barred
by
the
11th
amendment
because
ex
parte
young
does
not
cover
that
type
of
claim.
our
argument,
as
i
said
this
morning,
is
that
ex
parte
young
does
not
cover
the
kind
of
claim
that
we
have
in
this
case
and,
therefore,
edelman
fully
supports
our
position.
secondly,
counsel
has
said
that
state
law...
i
believe
mr.
ferleger
said...
has
been
clear
for
16
years
and
that
this
is
a
lawless
effort
by
the
state
officials
to
ignore
it.
first
of
all,
we
don't
think
it
was
clear
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
we
don't
think
it
was
clear
when
the
district
court
said
state
law
required
the
closing
of
pennhurst.
we
don't
think
it
was
clear
when
the
third
circuit
on
the
first
appeal
said
that
state
law
did
not
require
the
creation
of
cla's,
but
only
that
to
the
extent
that
there
are
facilities
being
maintained
that
they
provide
adequate
care
and
habilitation
and
frankly
we
don't
think
it
is
clear
now
because
the
decisions
from
the
pennsylvania
court
do
not
deal
with
the
issue
of
how
to
provide
cla's
where
the
legislature
has
not
provided
funding.
those
issues
are
not
present
in
the
state
cases
where
a
single
individual
is
concerned
and
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
funding
for
one
person
is
not
an
issue.
furthermore,
the
district
court,
in
rejecting
a
claim
for
damages,
said
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
the
state
defendants
were
not
carrying
out
the
duties
to
their
best
of
ability
and
had
no
reason
to
know
that
they
were
violating
any
law
or
any
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
at
that
time
and
that
is
at
page
75-a
of
the
original...
of
the
appendix
of
the
original
petition
for
certiorari--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--my
understanding
is
that
the
11th
amendment
issue
was
raised
certainly
on
appeal
the
first
time
to
the
third
circuit
if
not
before.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
was
raised
at
that
time
although
it
was
not
specifically
directed
toward
the
state
law
issues,
because
the
district
court,
of
course,
had
raised--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
was
raised
in
its
specifics
on
the
remand
to
the
third
circuit.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
we
raised
it
in
our
briefs
and,
of
course,
we
argued
it
before
the
third
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
did
address
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
and
they
rejected
it.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the
case...
as
i
understood
it,
those
cases,
those
claims,
were
before
the
third
circuit
on
appeal
at
that
point
so
we
filed
our
brief
with
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
they
should
not
consider
it.
i
have
nothing
further.
thank
you.
