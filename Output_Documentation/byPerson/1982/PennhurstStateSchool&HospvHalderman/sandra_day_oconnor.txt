how
do
you
distinguish
the
holding
of
this
court
about
the
11th
amendment
in
green
v.
louisville
railroad
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
conceive,
then,
that
you
have
to
make
this
ultra
vires
colorable
action
distinction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
suppose,
though,
if
we
decide
it
as
a
matter
of
comity
it
should
not
be
entertained
we
would
then
avoid
the
11th
amendment
inquiry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
that
has
stopped,
so
what
is
left
of
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
there
is
some
issue
about
who
has
to
pay
for
those
services
rendered?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
that
that
was
not
the
case
and
that
it
was
a
colorable
state
claim
here.
then
what
is
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
as
far
as
you
are
concerned,
it
does
not
make
any
difference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
application
of
comity
would
satisfy
all
those
concerns,
however,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
however,
against
that
is
the
required
expenditure
of
large
sums
from
the
state
treasury.
