mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
express
instruction
in
its
remand
in
pennhurst
i,
the
third
circuit,
to
consider
the
state
law
issue
required
that
the
determination
of
two
questions;
first,
the
substantiality
of
14th
amendment
issues
in
this
case;
and,
second,
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
decide
a
state
issue
which
is
pendent
to
a
14th
amendment
claim.
now,
with
respect
to
the
substantiality
of
the
14th
amendment
question
in
this
case,
the
third
circuit
en
banc
was
unanimous
as
to
its
substantiality.
petitioners
asked
no
certiorari
on
the
substantiality
of
the
14th
amendment
question
here.
to
say
that
the
14th
amendment
question
here
is
substantial
is
to
make
a
severe
understatement
given
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
romeo
v.
youngberg.
that
decision...
in
that
case,
the
very
14th
amendment
violations
claimed
in
this
case
were
found
by
this
court
to
violate
the
14th
amendment.
this
is
the
same
institution.
nicholas
romeo
is
one
member
of
the
class
here.
the
continuing
grievous
injuries
and
the
aggression
alleged
in
romeo
were
found
in
this
case
to
have
been
imposed
upon
the
class.
petitioners
sought
no
certiorari
as
to
the
14th
amendment
substantiality.
the
14th
amendment
question
here
is
not
fake
and
it
is
not
contrived.
given
that
then
the
only
question
is
the
power
of
the
court
below
to
proceed
as
it
did.
and,
with
respect
to
power
or
jurisdiction,
what
petitioners'
argument
resolves
to
is
the
source
of
the
law
relied
upon,
whether
federal
or
state,
determines
federal
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
no,
sir,
of
course
not.
those
are
the
comity
questions,
but
i
seek
to
prove
that.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
the
exercise
of
equitable
discretion
as
well.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
but
the
first
question
is
power
and
with
respect
to
it
the
source
of
the
law
argument
has
been
considered
and
rejected
in
gibbs,
exactly
that
argument
was
made
there,
that
resort
to
state
law
deprived
the
court
in
gibbs
of
article
iii
jurisdiction.
gibbs
held
that
federal
courts
have
article
iii
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
whole
case
including
the
state
law
issues
by
virtue
of
the
presence
of
a
real
federal
question.
now,
article
iii
jurisdictional
limits
are
no
less
sacrosanct
than
the
11th
amendment.
once
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
this
court...
in
fact,
chief
justice
marshall
has
consistently
said
the
court
has
it
to
decide
the
whole
case
including
the
state
issue.
now,
edelman
itself,
where
state
defendants
were
defendants
where
the
11th
amendment
was
raised,
dictates
the
result
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
here.
in
edelman,
this
court
approved
an
injunction
on
pendent
grounds
requiring
state
officials
to
timely
decide
public
assistance
claims.
in
edelman,
there
was
a
14th
amendment
claim
and
pendent
jurisdiction.
the
injunction
in
edelman,
prospective
as
here,
and
counsel
has
conceded
there
is
only
prospective
relief
in
this
case,
the
injunction
rested
upon
the
pendent
federal
statute
under
hagans.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
no,
your
honor.
it
was
a
pendent
federal
statute,
but
the
pendent
injunction
here
is
and
can
be
on
no
basis
different
from
the
pendent
injunction
in
edelman
where
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
spending-power
statute
such
as
the
social
security
act,
in
that
case
itself
overrides
the
11th
amendment.
in
edelman,
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
case
and
to
grant
an
injunction,
sourced
in
the
pendent
federal
statute,
had
to
come...
the
power
in
the
face
of
the
11th
amendment
had
to
come
from
the
presence
in
the
case
of
a
real
federal
question.
the
unanimous
and
several--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--14th
amendment
question.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
14th
amendment
question
for
this
court
has
not
held
that
a
spending
power
statute,
for
example,
by
itself
would
overcome
the
11th
amendment.
a
14th...
the
young
accommodation
between
the
14th
amendment
and
the
11th
is,
of
course,
what
is
at
stake
here
and
the
constitutional
claim
here
is
a
14th
amendment
claim.
now,
we
are,
as
i
hope
that
made
clear...
not
saying
that
the
11th
amendment
is
defeated
by
a
state
claim
but
rather
by
the
14th
amendment
federal
question
jurisdiction;
just
as
in
edelman,
the
11th
amendment
could
not
have
been
defeated
by
the
federal
spending
power
statute,
but
only
by
the
presence
of
a
14th
amendment
federal
question.
and,
of
course,
contrary
to
what
petitioners
suggest
in
their
brief
at
page
three,
if
you
can't
get
retroactive
relief
under
the
14th
amendment,
as
this
court
holds,
may
not,
absent
express
congressional
enforcement
of
the
14th
amendment,
you
can't.
then,
you
can't,
of
course,
get
it
under
the
pendent
state
claim.
that,
too,
simply
reflects
the
historic
accommodation
between
the
14th
amendment
and
the
11th.
this
court...
its
unanimous
several
opinions
on
this
count
in
maher
v.
gagne
holds
that
same
effect,
as
i
have
argued
the
injunction
in
edelman
which
you
approved
requires
us
to
seek.
indeed,
petitioners'
argument
that
the
source
of
the
law
relied
upon
is
the
key
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
cannot
be
accepted
unless
you
choose
to
cast
gibbs
in
severe
damnum
unless
siler
and
the
legion
of
cases
cited
by
the
united
states
in
its
brief
at
pages
22
and
23
are
overruled
and
unless
you
choose
to
disapprove
edelman
in
this
regard
as
well
as
townsend
and
swenson
and
king
and
smith
and
such
like.
the
question
then,
justice
white,
given
the
power
on
an
entirely
independent
ground
from
that
argued
by
my
colleague,
mr.
ferleger,
the
ultra
vires
matter,
given
the
power,
then
the
question
is
was
the
decision
to
exercise
it
below,
following
the
instructions
of
this
court
in
its
remand,
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
third
circuit?
the
united
states
suggests
in
its
brief,
and
we
agree
and
submit
to
the
court,
that
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
responsibly
followed
the
guidelines
long
established
by
this
court
in
gibbs,
in
siler
and
in
ashwander.
first,
the
hoary
policy
for
unitary
lawsuits
and
against
splintered
cases,
partaking
of
fairness
to
the
parties,
of
judicial
economy,
of
the
effective
rule
of
law,
avoiding
complex
and
uncertain
questions
of
the
binding
effect
of
factfinding
and
otherwise
that
split
litigation
gives
rise
to
and
to
which
this
court
adverted
in
patsy.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes,
it
did,
long
ago
in
1977.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
no,
your
honor,
it
decided
the
full
run
of
grounds.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
your
honor,
in
its
opinion
the
constitutional
issue
was
first
and
i
believe
the
federal
statutory
issue
second
and
the
state
statutory--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--well,
it
certainly
is
not
a
departure
from
the
hoary
tradition
against
splintered
cases,
but,
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
a
departure
from
the
ashwander
rule
which
petitioners
would
ask
this
court
to
place
in
serious
question
in
this
case.
if
the
district
court,
however,
departed
from
the
ashwander
rule
that
state
claims
should
first
be
decided,
the
third
circuit
did
not
pursuant
to
this
court's
instructions.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
yes,
it
is,
exactly,
your
honor.
and,
if
petitioners
had
their
way,
as
they
said,
i
believe,
in
question
from
you,
justice
white,
earlier,
the
federal
court
could
only
consider
the
constitutional
question.
the
effect
of
that,
your
honor,
is
to
cause
plaintiffs
to
omit
state
claims
and,
hence,
turning
ashwander
upside
down
to
face
federal
courts
entirely
unnecessarily
with
the
question
of
state
law
issues.
now,
the
policy
in
ashwander,
as
you
suggest,
justice
white,
really
derives
from
two
considerations.
one
is
the
policy
against...
a
constitutional
policy
like
the
one
against
splintered
litigation,
a
policy
against
the
unnecessary
decision
of
constitutional
question
for
its
own
sake,
for
the
integrity
of
constitutional
judgments,
the
avoidance
of
prematurity
and
so
on.
but,
there
is
quite
an
independent
policy
of
which
ashwander
and
siler,
which,
of
course,
is
the
father
to
ashwander,
partake
and
that
is
federalism
itself.
one
of
the
reasons
for
avoiding
constitutional
decisions
in
cases
involving
state
defendants
is
precisely
that
they
are
so
intrusive
and
the
constitutional
decision
binds
the
state
officials
forever.
a
decision
on
pendent
state
law
grounds
leaves
state
officials
free
to
try
to
change
state
law
rather
than
exercising
that
freedom.
petitioners--
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
each
of
those
concerns
would
require
that
the
application
of
comity
result
in
the
decision
by
the
federal
court
of
the
state
law.
remember,
that
unlike
fair
assessment,
there
is
no
tax
injunction
case
relative
here.
unlike
younger,
there
is
no
anti-injunction
statute
here.
indeed,
in
this
case,
as
gibbs
put
it,
there
is
especially
strong
reason
for
the
federal
court
to
exercise
its
power
to
decide
the
state
law
issue.
the
gibbs'
reason,
applicable
here,
is
that
the
state
law
issue
here
is
so
closely
tied
to
questions
of
federal
policy.
mr.
thomas
k.
gilhool
ah,
your
honor,
i
think
that
question
is
not
here.
indeed,
i
think
petitioners
have
conceded
here
that
the
relief
granted
below
is
less
costly
than
maintaining
the
wrongs
at
pennhurst.
the
finding
of
fact
by
district
court,
unanimously
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
to
that
effect;
that
the
provision
of
community
relief,
where
it
is
justified
for
the
individual
is
less
costly
than
the
maintenance
of
pennhurst.
again,
petitioners
did
not
seek
certiorari
here
on
that
finding
of
fact.
so,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
each
of
those
considerations
requires
that
comity
be
exercised.
if
i
may,
in
addition
to
pennhurst
i,
where
this
court
found
a
congressionally
expressed
national
policy
to
improve
the
care
and
treatment
of
the
retarded
by
the
use
of
community
facilities--
there
is,
of
course,
the
statute
noted
in
patsy,
the
civil
rights
of
institutionalized
persons
act,
expressive
of
the
same
policy
and
in
schweiker
v.
wilson,
justice
powell
writing
in
dissent
with
others
noted
the
same
federal
policy
and
traced
there
to
the
social
security
act
of
1965
and,
indeed,
as
expressed
there,
justice
powell,
that
policy
rests
in
the
retardation
facilities
and
community
mental
health
act
of
the
congress
of
1962,
precisely
the
act,
precisely
the
federal
act,
passed
in
response
to
the
community
initiatives,
which
invited
the
state
to
look
at
what
it
was
doing
with
retarded
people
and
resulted,
as
the
exhibits
in
the
record
of
this
case
demonstrate,
in
this
very
pennsylvania
statute,
the
act
of
1966.
that
is
park
exhibit
18.
if
i
may
return
just
a
moment
to
the
ultra
vires
argument
made
by
my
colleague,
mr.
ferleger,
let
me
suggest
that
you
cannot
read
the
decision
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
schmidt
or
the
several
opinions
unanimous
as
to
the
meaning
of
state
law
and
its
violation
by
state
defendants
by
all
of
the
members
of
the
third
circuit
en
banc
without
concluding
that
these
state
defendants
placed
themselves
systematically
outside
of
pennsylvania
law
by
their
conduct
with
respect
to
the
people
at
pennhurst.
just
before
i
close,
let
me
be
clear
that
the
county
petitioners
and
their
officials
here
do
not
share
whatever
11th
amendment
immunity
may
be
here
and
so
that
in
all
events
the
orders
below
as
to
them
must
be
affirmed.
and,
finally,
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
confess
that
following
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
pennhurst
i
and
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals,
plaintiffs...
respondents
here
find
no
support
for
the
original
order
appointing
the
special
master
and
in
particular
for
that
part
which
instructed
that
master
to
direct,
organize,
and
supervise
the
implementation
of
relief.
indeed,
the
district
court
itself,
on
the
first
return
of
the
mandate
to
it
after
this
court's
expression,
vacated
those
instructions.
it
also
vacated
the
instructions
to
assist
in
the
planning
of
relief,
a
function,
a
duty
for
which
the
appointment
of
a
master,
i
take
it,
is
unexceptional
when
as
here
the
state
defendants
twice
refused
to
come
forward
to
the
court
with
a
plan
for
implementation.
in
swann,
for
example,
such
a
master
was
appointed
and
this
court,
of
course,
affirmed
generally
there.
mr.
chief
justice.
