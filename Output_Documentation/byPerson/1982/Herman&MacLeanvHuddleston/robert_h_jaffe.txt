mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
issue
before
the
court
today
as
framed
by
cross-petitioner
herman
&
maclean
is
suggested
in
footnote
15
of
this
court's
decision
in
blue
chip
stamps
v.
manor
drug
stores
for
the
implied
action
under
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
in
rule
10(b)5
lie
for
actions
made
a
violation
of
the
1933
act
and
the
subject
of
express
civil
remedies
under
the
1933
act,
the
civil
remedy
provisions
being
section
11
and
section
12(ii).
section
12(i)
for
unregistered
securities
is
not
involved
here.
the
important
fact
here
in...
and
certainly
it
becomes
more
important
fact
in
view
of
some
of
the
comments
made
by
counsel...
is
that
the
fraud
committed
by
herman
&
maclean
was
for
actions
that
for
the
most
part
are
not
covered
by
the
express
provisions
of
section
11
of
the
1933
act
as
they
pertain
to
an
expert
accountant
such
as
herman
&
maclean,
named
as
an
expert
in
a
prospectus;
the
name
in
a
limited
way
only
consented
to
a
certain
portion
of
the
prospectus
or
the
registration
statement
as
being
expertised.
this
distinction
is
highlighted
by
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case.
unlike
most
other
cases
recently
decided
by
this
court
dealing
with
the
scope
of
section
10(b)
and
rule
10(b)5,
cases
such
as
hochfelder,
blue
chip
stamps,
and
santa
fe
industries,
where
the
facts
or
allegations
of
fraud
were
based
on
pleadings
made
in
a
complaint,
this
case
that
comes
before
you
after
a
jury,
a
trial
judge,
a
somewhat
maligned
trial
judge
here,
and
the
fifth
circuit
had
determined
herman
&
maclean
had
violated
rule
10(b)5
and
that
the
trial
record
justified
the
finding
in
scienter
for
a
course
of
conduct
intended
to
deceive
purchasers
of
securities
which
would
meet
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof.
i
call
attention
to
the
court
that
footnote
13
to
the
decision
of
judge
reuben
below...
i
don't
have
to
read
it
precisely;
it
is
the
257(a),
the
letter
dated
may
20,
1969,
in
which
herman
&
maclean
states,
"we
have
calculated
the
expenses
from
the
figures
given
to
us
and
the
contracts
and
the
other
information
obtained.
"
"and
it
would
appear
that
the
total
cost
for
building
the
speedway
and
for
the
initial
cost
to
bring
it
into
operation
would
be
$488,000
above
that
which
would
be
available
from
the
sale
of
the
issue
and
apart
from
mortgage
financing.
"
then
there
is
immediate
larry's
house,
larry
lopati,
president
of
tis.
rare,
after
that
meeting
there
is
another
letter
that
comes
out.
the
letter
is
also
found
in
the
appendix
at
267(a),
june
9,
1969,
for
herman
&
maclean
indicates
that
a
reduced
cost
as
a
consequence
of
that
meeting.
again,
as
found
by
the
court
below,
found
by
judge
reuben
after
reviewing
the
whole
trial
record,
the
costs
that
were
parred
from
the
preparer
of
the
use
of
proceeds
section,
herman
&
maclean,
were
costs
which
in
fact
had
been
contracted
for
prior
to
the
date
of
his
letter,
june
9,
1969.
so
what
we
have
here
is
clear
evidence
according
to
the
jury,
according
to
the
trial
judge,
and
according
to
the
fifth
circuit
review
of
the
whole
record,
that
the
evidence
against
herman
&
maclean
was
not
just
a
possible
gross
negligence
but
of
the
type
of
evidence
that
would
meet
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
fraud.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
justice
o'connor,
that's
a
good
question
because
i
don't
know
the
answer.
this
was
a
sua
sponte
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit.
it
was
never
raised
by
any
party.
i
in
reading
the
decision
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
if
we
got
down
to...
if
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
is
upheld
by
this
court
as
being
the
standard
in
a
civil
fraud
action.
as
to
whether
that's
going
to
apply
to
the
element
of
materiality,
whether
it's
going
to
apply
to
the
element
of
reliance,
whether
it's
going
to
apply
to
the
element
of
causation,
how
are
they
going
to
break
it
down?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
seems
to
apply
across
the
board
as
to
each
particular
element,
as
it's
phrased
in
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
but
i
really
don't
know
what
the
answer
would
be,
and
i
imagine
if
this
court
upheld
that
standard,
it's
going
to
have
to
be
explored
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
differs
from
state
to
state.
i
know
my
state...
i
come
really
from
new
jersey,
not
texas...
it's...
it's
a
preponderance
standard,
for
sure.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
i
think
it
would
be
all
elements,
your
honor.
and
to
deal
with
that
very
quickly,
we
have...
and
i
don't
want
to
deal
with
it
quickly;
this
is
really
important...
we
might
have
met
it
in
this
case,
according
to
the
fifth
circuit,
but
it's
going
to
put
a
very
big
burden
under
the
securities
laws
if
that's
applied
to
all
10(b)5
cases.
what
is
at
risk
here
is
money
damages.
that
was
what
was
at
risk
here,
and
we've
talked
about
it
being
a
lot
of
money
damages.
but
the
fact
remains
it's
still
money
damages.
herman
&
maclean
was
never
required
to
not
practice
in
front
of
the
sec,
not
required
to
limit
their
activities,
were
not
enjoined
in
any
way,
and
the
opprobrium
which
they
attach
to
this
decision
that
meeting
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
does
not
seem
to
comport
with
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
which
would
find
only
in
special
circumstances...
deportation
hearings,
confinement
to
a
mental
institution.
i
don't
think
it
comes
to
that.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
well,
i
think
they
would.
i
think
juries
pay
attention
to
the
charges
of
the
court.
and
one
of
the
things
at
every
trial
is
the
judge
makes
very
clear
even
when
they
pick
out
the
jurors,
are
you
going
to
pick
out...
are
you
going
to
follow
the
directions
of
this
court?
i
remember
in
this
case
there
was
one
juror
that
says,
any
director
that's
involved
in
fraud
i
would
find
liable,
and
then
the
judge
said,
well,
it
might
be
a
difference
of
culpability
under
the
controlling
person
standard,
and
you
are
dismissed.
he
dismissed
that
person
from
the
jury.
i
think
the
jury
has
to
follow
the
law.
the
jury
is
explained
properly
the
differences
between
clear
and
convincing
and
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
they're
going
to
follow
it.
this
jury,
i
felt,
was
a
very
good
jury,
a
discerning
jury
which
made
decisions
between
culpability
as
to
the
various
defendants
here.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
some
of
them,
your
honor,
they
found
were
not
culpable
under
the
scienter
standard,
although
so
had
an
action...
we
had
an
action;
we
don't
anymore...
under
the
texas
securities
act,
which
follows
the
section
11
as
the
negligence
standard.
we
chose
to
go
for
the
scienter
standard
as
to
both
on
the
basis
that
if
there
was
such
a
finding,
we
would
then
get
damages
for
attorney's
fees,
which
we
felt
would
come
under
the
texas
securities
act.
so
i
do
think
there's
a
big
difference.
the
findings
of
fraud
with
scienter
which
herman
&
maclean
admits,
indeed
advocates,
in
its
reply
brief,
are
not
covered
by
the
express
liability
provisions
of
section
11
of
the
1933
act.
conscious
of
these
findings
made
by
the
lower
courts
as
the
scienter,
herman
&
maclean
has
resorted
to
the
defense
of
no
writ,
no
right.
there
was
one
part
of
the
reply
brief
which...
in
which
herman
&
maclean
mention
in
the
reply
brief
that...
that
no
purchaser...
this
is
found
at
page
7
of
the
reply
brief...
no
purchaser
of
the
securities,
certainly
mr.
huddleston,
mr.
bradley,
had
any
basis
from
a
reading
of
the
prospectus
for
relying
on
herman
&
maclean
for
the
accuracy
of
estimated
costs
of
construction.
i
agree
that
when
you
look
at
the
prospectus
you
would
not
know
as
a
purchaser
that
it
was
herman
&
maclean,
as
we
proved
during
trial,
who
was
the
party
essentially
responsible
for
the
use
of
proceeds
section
for
putting
together
the
construction
figures,
because
as
part
of
the
fraud,
an
essential
part
of
the
fraud
found
by
the
jury
in
the
answers
to
special
interrogatories
to
be
in
essence
of
the
fraud,
was
that
they
get
the
engineers
to
give
a
comfort
letter,
which
everybody
connected
with
the
prospectus
knew
was
untrue,
that
they
had
calculated
the
estimated
costs
remaining
and
had
found
it
to
be
accurate.
they
never
did,
and
they
knew
this
to
be
fact.
and
this
was
again
what
was
picked
up
by
judge
reuben.
they
refused
to
give
comfort
concerning
the
construction
costs,
herman
&
maclean
in
its
comfort
letter,
october
30,
1969,
because
they
knew.
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
court
below
found
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
their
participation
in
the
fraud.
and
also,
may
i
say,
it
is
herman
&
maclean,
there
is
an
administrative
process,
herman
&
maclean
is
the
one
that
responds
to
the
letters
of
comment,
which
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
send
in
respect
to
these
registration
statements.
and
that
would
be
found,
for
example,
there
was
a
letter
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
found
at
284
of
the
appendix,
asking
for
updated
financial
statements.
the
person
that
responds
to
this
information
is
herman
&
maclean,
and
they
convinced...
well,
they
certainly
do
not
put
the
information
requested
by
the
securities
commission,
because
if
they
had
done
so,
the
fraud
would
have
been
revealed.
the
material
adverse
financial
information
regarding
the
construction
of
the
speedway
would
have
been
revealed.
it
would
have
been
disclosed.
so
herman
&
maclean
was
definitely
a
direct
participant
as
found
by
the
jury,
as
found
by
the
trial
court.
and
yet
these
are
areas
outside
of
section
11
because
the
use
of
proceeds
section
does
not
come
under
the
liability
area
of
the
section
11.
i
know
that...
i
believe,
i
hope...
that
a
chart
was
handed
up
to
the
court
as
to
the
differences
between
the
two
causes
of
action.
and
regarding
persons
subject
to
liability
under
section
11,
it's
a
narrow
class
of
persons
who
have
a
direct
role,
the
registered
offering
including
experts
only...
we
use
the
word
"expertised"...
portion
of
the
registration
statement.
to
that
portion
of
the
registration
statement
to
which
they
gave
their
consent
to
affix
the
name.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
certified
statement
for
the
year
ending
may
30,
1969.
they
did
not
give
their
consent,
they
claimed
during
trial.
and
indeed,
i
had
an
expert
accountant
testify
who
would
not
ordinarily
view
the
case,
to
the
pro
forma
balance
sheet
which
purported
to
show
the
effect
of
the
issue,
purported
to
show
when
the
issue
was
sold
and
the
moneys
collected,
there
would
be
$93,000
of
working
capital
and
there
would
also
be
$278,000
of
moneys
reserved,
cash
reserved
to
meet
the
expenses
to
the
opening
day.
in
fact,
there
was
half
a
million
dollars'
deficit
in
the
working
capital
position
of
tis
the
day
they
received
the
proceeds
of
the
issue.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
i
think
that's
the
question
which
is
being
put.
my
clients
are
saying,
since
congress
did
not
provide
this
class
of
person
would
be
liable
for
fraud,
of
the
type
of
fraud
found
by
the
jury
here,
he
is
exempt,
he
can
get
away
with
it.
he
can
commit
fraud
with
impunity.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
they
intended
the
liability
to
be
exclusive
under
that
section.
i
think
congress
intended
that
when
the
commission
was--
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
--what's
that,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
because
it's
a
very
strict
liability
section
for
negligence.
now,
where
a
person
states
in
the
prospectus,
i
am,
you
can
rely
upon
me
as
an
expert,
and
he
makes
a
gross
mistake
without
intent,
and
that's
the
whole
point--
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
--he
is
stuck.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
no,
your
honor,
not
under...
there's
no
other
section
providing
for
negligence
standard.
certainly,
10(b)5
is
not
a
negligence
standard.
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
before
you
can
catch
in
that
catch-all
section
of
the
1934
act--
mr.
robert
h.
jaffe
--a
lot
more
than
negligent,
your
honor.
it
has
to
be,
i
think,
a
proof
that
can
meet
rule
9(b)
first
in
the
pleading
before
you
even
get
near
trial.
the
court
is
now
uniformly
looking
at
rule
9(b)
to
plead
fraud
with
particularity,
particularly
in
securities
cases,
as
the
key
way
to
knock
out
these
strike
and
nuisance
suits.
and
i
think
that's
a...
that
is
the
kind
of
procedure
limitation
which
you
are
not
going
to
have
in
a
section
11.
section
11,
you'll
say,
look,
there
was
a
mistake,
gross
mistake,
it's
material.
and
now
they
have
to
come
in
and
defend,
justify;
they
have
to
come
in
and
prove
their
due
diligence,
show
the
chart
that
they
followed
through,
making
sure
they
did
everything.
it's
not
so
in
a
10(b)5
action.
10(b)5
action
to
allege
fraud,
that
court's
going
to
say,
particularity.
in
fact,
there's
a
second
part
of
that
10(b)
which
says
you
can
ever
malice
or
intent
with
generality,
but
the
courts,
i
think,
are
looking
at
the
particularization
of
fraud
even
through
the
intent
portion.
the
second
line
of
offense,
herman
&
maclean
argues
that
this
court
allows
a
private
right
of
action
under
rule
10(b)5
with
respect
to
a
fraud
involving
preparation
and
delivery
of
a
false
and
misleading
prospectus.
it
would
nullify
the
procedure
restrictions,
i.e.,
bring
in
those
procedural
restrictions
then
on
10(b)5.
well,
it's
forgotten
one
of
the
procedure
restrictions
is
the
posting
of
a
bond.
but
that
bond
was
posted
for
two
purposes,
not
only
to
prevent
blackmail
suits
but
to
prevent
defense
against
the
purely
contentious
litigation
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
so
i
think
that
that
type
of
restriction
would
cut
two
ways.
very
briefly,
as
to
the
statute
of
limitations
again,
this
court
has
looked
at
the
statute
of
limitations
question
and
in
the
sense
of
one
of
the
footnotes
in
hochfelder
saying
that
the
state
statute
of
limitations
apply.
it
well
may
be
that
this
court
believes
some
additional
procedural
limitations
may
be
applicable
to
10(b)5.
but
it
has
not
so
ruled,
and
i
think
the
plaintiffs
have
been
under
rule
10(b)5,
have
appropriately
been
following
the
decision
of
the
court.
if
congress
wanted
to
have
a
limitation,
as
they
did
in
another
situation
in
the
1934
act,
in
1938
they
amended
a
certain
provision
under
15(c)1
to
provide
for
a
1-year
and
3-year
statute
of
limitations.
they
could
have
done
so.
they
have
not
done
so.
it
seems
they
have
acquiesced
in
the
decision
of
the
courts
to
allow
a
statute
