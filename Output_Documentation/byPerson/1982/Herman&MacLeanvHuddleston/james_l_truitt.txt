mr.
james
l.
truitt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
issues
presented
in
this
appeal:
the
first
issue
is
whether
or
not
purchasers
of
registered
securities
who
may
sue
under
section
11
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
may
also
have
recourse
to
the
implied
remedies
permitted
under
section
17(a)
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
and
under
rule
10(b)5
of
the
securities
act
of
1934.
the
second
issue
is
whether
in
such
implied
remedies
cases
the
standard
of
evidence
is
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
or
is
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard.
herman
&
maclean
is
my
client.
it
is
a
firm
of
certified
public
accountants
with
offices
in
detroit,
michigan.
herman
&
maclean
were
the
auditors
for
texas
international
speedway
in
connection
with
a
public
offering
of
securities
which
occurred
in
november
of
1969
in
the
heyday
of
the
"go-go
period".
that
offering
of
securities
was
underwritten
on
a
firm
commitment
basis
by
a
group
of
underwriters
headed
by
ladenburg,
thalmann
&
company.
the
offering
of
securities
was
successful.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
i
think
it
has
gotten
to
be,
your
honor.
it's
a
term
which
has
been
applied
frequently.
i
think
there's
a
book
called
'60s
and
early
'70s,
in
which
it
seemed
that
purchasers
or
investors--
mr.
james
l.
truitt
--you
may,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure.
i
haven't
looked
at
that.
but
i
think
it's
a
term
that
has
a
commonly
understood
significance
in
the
securities
industry.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
l.
truitt
the
'60s
and
early
'70s
during
which
the
appetite
for
speculative
securities
seemed
to
be
very
high.
we've
not
had,
except
sporadically,
a
recurrence
of
that
sort
of
appetite
for
speculative
securities.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
the
operations
of
texas
international
speedway
were
not
successful.
on
november
30,
1970,
which
was
some
13
months
after
the
offering
texas
international
speedway
filed
a
petition
for
bankruptcy
under
chapter
10
of
the
federal
bankruptcy
laws.
on
august
25,
1972,
which
was
approximately
21
months
after
the
filing
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
just
short
of
3
years
after
the
effective
date
of
the
public
offering,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
lawsuit
filed
their
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
section
11
of
the
securities
act
of
1933
is
a
piece
of
legislation
directed
specifically
at
public
offerings
of
securities.
it
is
a
statute
which
was
designed
specifically
for
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
section
11
was
intended
by
congress
to
accomplish
certain
things.
it
was
intended
to,
as
this
court
has
observed
in
hochfelder,
to
make
certain
that
all
material
information
necessary
to
permit
an
investor
to
make
an
informed
judgment
would
be
available
for
that
investor.
it
was
also
intended
to
enhance
standards
of
integrity
and
fair
dealing
through
the
imposition
of
specified
civil
liabilities.
and
i
think
the
operative
word
for
my
purposes
in
that
paraphrase
of
hochfelder
is
the
term
"specified".
in
order
to
protect
the
capital
formation
process,
congress
deemed
it
necessary
to
advise
those
persons
participating
in
public
offerings
as
to
what
the
scope
of
their
liabilities
would
be.
congress
did
that
very
specifically
in
section
11.
every
participant
in
a
section...
or
in
a
registration
statement
can
read
section
11
and
tell
precisely
what
the
scope
of
his
liability
is.
whether
he
is
the
issuer,
a
director,
an
officer
of
the
company,
an
underwriter,
or
an
accountant,
he
can
tell
what
his
liabilities
are.
notwithstanding
the
availability
of
section
11,
the
plaintiffs,
as
i
have
said,
chose
to
sue
under
10(b)5
and
17(a).
by
doing
so,
they
accomplished
three
objectives:
they
avoided
limitations
claims,
which
would
have
been
particularly
difficult
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
they
broadened
the
basis
for
liability
of
those
persons
who
they
named
as
defendants.
in
particular
reference
to
my
client,
the
public
accounting
firm,
by
suing
under
10(b)5
rather
than
section
11,
the
plaintiffs
were
permitted
to
allege
that
accountants
are
responsible
for
non-accounting
materials,
for
materials
that
appear
in
the
prospectus,
in
the
use
of
proceeds
table
and
elsewhere,
despite
the
fact
that
those
materials
not
only
were
not
expertised
by
my
client,
by
the
accounting
firm,
but
were
in
fact
expertised
by
other
experts.
probably
the
clearest
example
that
you
can
find
in
section
11
of
the
type
of
representation
for
which
one
expert
is
not
liable;
that
is,
something
expertised
by
another
expert.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
expertised,
a
piece
of
expertised
material
is
material
which
is
included
in
a
registration
statement
on
the
basis
of
the
authority
of
an
expert.
a
prospectus,
and
the
prospectus
in
this
case,
has
a
section
entitled
"experts",
and
it
says,
it
identifies
that
portion
of
the
prospectus
that
is
included
therein
on
the
basis
of
the
authority
of
an
expert.
and
it
identifies
which
expert
it
is
and
what
the
materials
are.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
expert
section
stated
that
the
estimated
cost
of
building
the
speedway
was
expertised
by
a
firm
of
accountants...
excuse
me...
a
firm
of
engineers.
and
yet
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
expertised
by
engineers
and
not
by
accountants,
the
plaintiffs
by
suing
under
10(b)5
were
permitted
to
allege
that
the
accountants
were
responsible
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
those
estimates
were
incorrect.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
well,
the
plaintiffs
allege
both
that
the
accountants
were
acting
as
principal
and
that
they
were
acting
as
aiders
and
abettors;
that
is
to
say
that,
even
though
they
were
not
responsible
for
those
estimates,
they
are
charged
with
knowledge
of
the
incorrectness
of
those
estimates
and
that
that
knowledge
serves
to
satisfy
the
scienter
requirement
of
10(b)5
and
section
17.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
been
borrowed
from
the
criminal
law
without
a
great
deal
of
analysis.
it
has
been
taken
in
whole
from
the
criminal
law.
and
the
courts
have
applied
it
holding
that
the...
that
the
elements
are
an
awareness,
a
generalized
awareness,
that
there
is
some
illegal
activity
going
on
and
the
performance
of
some
conduct
which
materially
contributes
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
illegal
purpose.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
no,
your
honor,
they
do
not.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
there,
not
in
connection
with
the
'33
or
'34
acts.
there
was
a
committee
report,
there
was
a
proposal,
as
i
recall,
in
1959
or
1960,
to
use
the
term
"aider
and
abettor"
in
application
to
certain
administrative
processes.
but
the
commission
advised
the
congress
at
that
time
that
the
aider-and-abettor
analysis
would
apply
only
as
regards
administrative
processes,
sec
regulation,
and
that
it
did
not
at
that
time
regard
the
aider-and-abettor
concept
as
applicable
for
civil
purposes.
in
any
event,
that
legislation
in
which
that
proposal
was
made
did
not
come
to
fruition.
the
other
major
accomplishment
of
suing
under
17(a)
and
10(b)5
rather
than
section
11
has
to
do
with
the
issue
of
damage.
the
damages
provisions
of
section
11
are
well
defined
and
fairly
restrictive.
the
principal
restriction
which
is
operative
generally
is
that
a
participant
in
the
registration
process
is
liable
only
for
an
amount
equal
to
the
price
at
which
the
securities
were
offered
to
the
public.
therefore,
if
you
had
a
situation
in
which
securities
offered
to
the
public
at
$5
a
share
and
trade
thereafter
at
$10
or
$15
a
share,
notwithstanding
that
increase
in
price,
the
participants
in
the
registration
process
under
section
11
are
liable
only
for
$5
per
share.
another
very
important
distinction
in
the
area
of
damages
has
to
do
with
underwriters.
an
underwriter
is
generally
liable
only
for
that
portion
of
the
securities
underwritten
by
him.
there
is
an
exception
where
an
underwriter
receives
compensation
which
is
not
shared
pro
rata
with
all
other
underwriters.
but
aside
from
that,
that
exception,
an
underwriter
may
be
responsible
only
for
that
portion
of
the
securities
which
he
underwrites.
in
the
facts
of
the
present
case,
that
is
fairly
graphically
demonstrated
by
russ
&
company,
which
i
have
chosen
just
because
they're
one
of
the
smaller
underwriters.
they
underwrote
30
units
out
of
the
3,300
units
which
were
sold
in
this
offering.
under
section
11
the
aggregate
liability
of
russ
&
company
would
have
been
$44,000.
under
10(b)5
or
under
17(a),
if
those
statutes
providing
client
remedies,
the
liability
of
russ
&
company
would
be
$4,400,000
plus...
plus...
any
additional
premium
over
and
above
that
which
might
arise
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
those
securities
trade
at
a
premium.
so
the
effect
of
permitting
plaintiffs
recourse
to
10(b)5
and
17(a)
is
to
dramatically
increase
the
exposure
of
certain
defendants.
one
other
significant
effect
is
that
section
11
only
imposes
liability
on
certain...
certain
persons.
not
every
participant
in
the
process
of
preparing
a
registration
statement
or
bringing
an
offering
to
market
is
even
potentially
liable.
for
example,
attorneys
for
underwriters
are
not
liable
under
section
11.
to
use
the
facts
of
our
case,
the
general
contractor
who
was
going
to
build
the
speedway,
which
would
have
been
paid
for
out
of
the
funds
of
this
offering,
was
not
liable
under
section
11.
in
this
case,
however,
the
plaintiffs
were
permitted
to
sue
under
10(b)5
and
17(a),
and
they
were
permitted
to
sue
the
attorneys
for
the
underwriters
and
the
general
contractor.
now,
this
court
has
previously
remarked
on
the
in
terrorem
effects
of
10(b)5
legislation...
excuse
me...
litigation.
it
is
a
terrifying
prospect
because
of
the
large
amounts
which
may
be
involved,
because
of
the
large
expenses
which
are
incurred
in
defending
oneself.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
10(b)5
lawsuits
are
frequently,
if
not
generally,
brought
for
their
settlement
value
because
of
the
fact
that
the
risks
of
trial
can
be
enormous.
the
trial
of
a
10(b)5
lawsuit
is
a
difficult
and
tedious
proposition
for
the
attorneys
and
for
the
judge.
as
a
result
of
that,
federal
judges
frequently
encourage,
even
demand,
that
the
suit
be
settled
before
trial.
and
a
defendant
resists
this
demand
at
his
grave
peril.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
by
calling
counsel
into
his
chambers
and
saying,
gentlemen,
this
is
a
lawsuit
which
i
think
should
be
settled;
i
believe
very
strongly
it
should
be
settled.
now,
those
demands
will
not
always
be
heeded,
but
they
may
be
made,
and
they
were
made
in
this
case.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
well,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
herman
&
maclean
refused
to
settle,
and
it
suffered
five
consequences
of
refusing
to
settle.
first
off,
it
lost
virtually
every
evidentiary
ruling
which
was
made--
mr.
james
l.
truitt
--it
might
have
anyway,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
james
l.
truitt
--it
might
have,
your
honor,
but
if
you
will
let
me
go
on
through
the
other
list
of
things
that
happened,
i
think
there
is
a
pattern--
mr.
james
l.
truitt
--yes,
your
honor,
that
can
be
done,
and
i
am
sure
it
has
been
done.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
more
graphic
than
one
would
normally
find.
getting
back
to
the
evidentiary
rulings
which
might
or
might
not
be
correct
and
which
we
might
or
might
not
have
lost,
secondly,
the
jury
charge.
the
jury
charge
was
given
in
virtually
the
same
language
submitted
by
the
plaintiffs.
the
jury
charge
was
obviously
and
flagrantly
defective.
there
was
no
charge
given
as
to
reliance.
there
was
no
charge
given
as
to
causation.
the
failure
to
give
those
charges
despite
the
insistence
of
the
defendants
that
they
be
given,
required
the
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
this
case
and
remand
it.
thirdly,
the
district
court
bifurcated
this
proceeding
for
two
trials,
a
trial
on
liability
and
then
a
trial
on
damages.
after
the
trial
on
liability
and
without
any
evidence
being
submitted
on
the
issue
of
damages,
a
final
judgment
covering
both
liability
and
damages
was
entered.
fourthly,
attorney's
fees
in
the
amount
of
$1
million
were
awarded
in
this
case,
$500,000
to
come
from
the
amount
recovered
on
behalf
of
the
class,
$500,000
assessed
as
additional
damages
in
complete
disregard
of
the
holdings
of
this
court
which
do
not
permit
under
the
american
rule
the
assessment
of
damages...
the
assessment
of
attorney's
fees
as
additional
damages
without
some
finding
of
wrong-doing
over
and
above
the
establishment
of
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action
in
the
case.
the
district
judge
did
not
pinpoint,
did
not
specify
what
it
was
that
justified
the
assessment
of
these
damages,
these
attorney's
fees
as
damages.
but
that
nevertheless
occurred.
finally,
after
a
judgment
was
entered,
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
for
stay
based
upon
a
supersedeas
bond
which
was
less
than
the
supersedeas
bond
called
for
by
the
local
rule.
a
hearing
was
had
on
that
motion,
and
at
that
hearing
the
district
judge
gave
on
the
record
as
his
only
basis
for
refusing
to
grant
that
motion
the
fact
that
the
defendants
had
refused
to
heed
his
demand
that
the
lawsuit
be
settled.
normally,
the
causal
relationship
between
a
refusal
to
heed
a
settlement
demand
and
the
animus
of
the
district
court
is
a
matter
of
greater
speculation
than
it
is
in
this
case.
but
i
submit
that
it
was
on
the
record
in
this
case.
the
significance
of
this
course
of
events
in
this
appeal
and
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
the
section
11
because
of
its
much
greater
precision
does
not
lend
itself
to
these
kinds
of
in
terrorem
tactics
as
does
10(b)5;
and
therefore,
the
integrity
of
section
11,
i
submit,
should
be
preserved.
getting
over
for
a
moment
to
the
standard
of
evidence
issue
as
it
relates
to
the
resolution
of
the
overlapping
remedies
issue,
the
difficulty
in
briefing
and
deciding
the
standard
of
evidence
applicable
in
an
implied
remedies
case
is
the
absence
of
any
rule
or
decision
to
point
to
to
determine
which
standard
should
apply.
after
preparing
our
brief
and
reading
the
other
briefs,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
it
comes
down
to
is
a
subjective
determination
of
the
degree
of
protection
which
the
court
should
extend
to
persons
accused
of
civil
fraud,
taking
into
account
the
special
damages
to
reputations
which
can
follow
from
a
fraud
judgment.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
this
problem
is
not
a
problem
in
section
11
cases.
there's
no
need
to
attempt
to
determine
which
standard
of
evidence
applies,
because
in
a
section
11
case
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiffs
to
go
forward
and
show
that
a
registration
statement
is
false
and
misleading.
but
once
that
burden
is
satisfied,
then
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
establish
defenses
related
to
lack
of
culpability,
which
every
defendant
other
than
the
issuer
has.
this
is
an
example,
it
seems
to
me,
of
the
superiority
of
the
section
11
cause
of
action,
and
we
don't
find
ourselves
in
this
never-never
world
of
trying
to
determine
by
access
to
federal
common
law
or
by,
as
is
the
case
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
by
reference
to
what
is
deemed
to
be
the
most
comparable
state
statute
of
limitations
period,
the
rule
applicable
to
the
proceedings.
now,
the
question
presented
in
this
appeal
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
straightforward
one,
and
that
is,
whether
the
federal
courts
are
obligated
to
respect
the
express
statutory
remedy
for
registered
offerings
provided
by
congress.
if
the
courts
are
obligated
to
respect
that
statutory
scheme,
then
the
various
elements
of
that
scheme
must
be
respected.
the
statute
of
limitations
period
must
be
respected.
the
other
attributes
of
the
express
remedy
must
be
respected.
when
that
occurs,
it
seems
to
me
there's
no
room
left
for
the
existence
of
implied
remedies.
now,
the
problem
of
analysis
here
seems
to
me
to
be
to
some
degree
a
semantic
problem.
the
plaintiffs
and
the
commission
speak
in
terms
of
cumulative
or
supplemental
remedies.
now,
those
terms
sound
innocuous
enough.
but
the
fact
is
that
one
cannot
permit
a
cumulative
or
supplemental
remedy
to
stand
alongside
an
express
remedy
in
those
circumstances
where
the
cumulative
remedy
provides
a
result
which
is
proscribed
by
the
express
remedy.
and
a
good
example
is
the
limitations
period.
we
can...
a
plaintiff
cannot
both
sue
under
section
11
and
be
forced
to
comply
with
the
limitations
period
provided
by
section
13
of
the
1933
act
and
also
sue
under
10(b)5
and
have
recourse
to
the
longer
limitations
period
provided
by
that
kind
of
action.
the
court
must
select
one
or
the
other.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
congress
has
spoken,
the
court
is
obligated
to
respect
what
congress
has
said.
now,
the
commission
and
the
plaintiffs
point
out
the
fact
that
there
are
preservations
or
remedies
clauses
in
the
1933
and
1934
acts.
and
indeed
there
are.
those
provisions,
however,
do
not
imply
the
existence
of
an
implied
federal
remedy.
section
16
of
the
1933
act
was
enacted
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
doctrine
of
implied
federal
securities
laws
remedies.
it
was
enacted
before
the
securities
act
of
1934
was
enacted.
therefore,
it
could
not
have
been
enacted
in
contemplation
of
a
10(b)5
cause
of
action.
that
provision
seems
to
me
clearly
to
contemplate
the
survival
state
common
law
remedies.
and
i
think
that
that
fact
is
borne
out
by
the
existence
of
section
22
of
the
1933
act.
section
22
provides
that
actions
may
be
brought
either
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
federal
court
and
further
provides
that
if
brought
in
the
state
court
such
actions
may
not
be
removed
to
the
federal
court.
the
'34
act,
section
27
of
the
'34
act,
provides
exactly
the
opposite.
it
provides
that
actions
brought
under
the
1934
act
may
be
brought
only
in
the
federal
courts.
the
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
such
actions.
that--
mr.
james
l.
truitt
--a
purchaser
who
alleges
to
have
been
defrauded
in
connection
with
the
purchase
of
registered
securities--
mr.
james
l.
truitt
--may
sue
under
section
11.
now,
section
11
is
a
fraud
statute.
under
some
circumstances
a
defendant
can
avoid
liability
by
showing
that
he
did
not
act
negligently.
but
the
plaintiff
must
first
show
fraud
at
least
to
the
degree
that
fraud
is
defined
as
there
being
something
false
or
misleading
about
the
registration
statement.
now,
as
to
certain
people,
negligence
is
not
the
standard.
for
example,
as
to
a
director
who
is
trying
to
avoid,
or
an
underwriter
who
is
trying
to
avoid,
liability
with
respect
to
something
appearing
in
the
financial
statements,
he
is
not
required
to
show
negligence
or
he
is
not
required
to
disprove
negligence.
he
is
required
only
to
disprove
that
he
did
not
act
either
recklessly
or
intentionally.
so
that
the
notion
that
section
13
is
a
negligence
statute
and
therefore
constitutes
a
different
sort
of
animal
from
10(b)5
is,
i
think,
an
erroneous
notion.
they
are
both
fraud
statutes.
they
contemplate
different
schemes
and
under
some
circumstances
a
proof
that
a
person
has
not
been
either
negligent
nor
behaved
intentionally
will
provide
a
defense,
but
it's
nevertheless
a
fraud
statute.
now,
if
a
person
finds
himself
outside
the
scope
of
that
statute
because
the
limitations
period
has
run
or
he
wants
to
sue
the
attorney
for
the
underwriters
or
for
any
of
a
number
of
other
reasons,
such
a
person
may
still
sue
in
state
courts.
and
that
is
why
the
preservation
of
remedies
language
is
there.
and
that
is
why
the
'33
act
provides
that
actions
alleging
liability
under
section
11
may
be
brought
in
the
state
courts
and,
if
brought
in
the
state
courts,
must
be
maintained
in
the
state
courts.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
it
would
be
wrong
not
to
permit
recovery
under
section
10(b)
because
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
intended
the
securities
laws,
and
particularly
the
'34
act,
to
be
complete
and
effective.
the
commission
has
cited
in
support
of
that
proposition
section
2
of
the
1934
act.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
unless
there
are
questions,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
truitt
thank
you.
i
want
to
address
myself
first
to
the
what
i
understand
to
be
the
line
of
argument
that
this
court
in
hochfelder
has
approved
the
holding
in
fishman.
i
think
that's
not
true.
i
think
this
court
in
the
hochfelder
case
assumed
the
possibility
that
the
fishman
analysis
was
correct
and
the
possibility
that
there
were
overlapping
remedies.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
in
that
place
in
the
hochfelder
opinion
where
the
language
is
found
to
which
counsel
refers,
the
court
cites
not
only
the
fishman
case,
which
holds
that
there
is
an
overlapping
remedy,
it
also
cites
the
rosenberg
case,
which
holds
that
there
is
not.
i
think
it's
clearly
the
case
because
of
the
fact
that
the
court
has
left
open
the
implied
remedy
issue,
not
only
where
the
overlap
is
between
10(b)5
and
11
but
also
in
other
situations
where
the
overlap
is
between
10(b)5
and
section
18
of
the
'34
act.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
court
has
left
that
issue
open.
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
say
that
the
court
held
in
hochfelder
that
the
implied
remedies,
that
overlapping
remedies
are
to
be
permitted.
now,
if
i
can
address
my
attention
just
for
a
moment
to
the
legislative
reenactment
line
of
argument.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
line
of
argument,
in
effect,
reverses
the
role
of
congress
and
the
courts.
it
assumes
first
that
it
is
the
function
of
this
court
to
enact
legislation
to
establish
remedies.
that
is
the
function
of
congress,
and
where
congress
has
enacted
legislation,
to
establish
remedies,
and
where
it
has
said
that
a
person
may
be
liable
in
them
circumstances
and
not
in
those,
it's
not
appropriate
for
the
court
through
exercising
a
trade-off
or
in
any
other
fashion
to
override
those
limitations
established
by
congress.
even
more
importantly
for
the
legislative
reenactment
argument,
it
assumes
that
it
is
the
function
of
the
congress
to
monitor
the
rulings
of
the
lower
federal
courts
and
where
those
rulings
are
incorrect,
to
reverse
them
by
means
of
amendatory
legislation.
that's
not
the
function
of
congress;
that's
the
function
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
of
this
court.
one
other
serious
problem
with
the
legislative
reenactment
doctrine
is
that
it
applies
only
in
those
circumstances
where
the
holding
in
question
does
not
bear
the
weight
of
legal
analysis.
if
the
holding
in
question
bore
the
weight
of
legal
analysis,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
make
reference
to
legislative
reenactment
as
providing
some
sort
of
independent
support.
one
could
look
simply
at
the
holding
under
question
and
hold
that
that...
that
that
is
correct.
thirdly,
i
think
that
there
is
a
distinction
which
is
sometimes
missed
between
awareness
of
a
holding
and
ratification
of
that
holding
for
example,
the
commission
points
to
the
enactment
of
21(g)
of
the
1934
act
which
provides
that
an
implied
cause
of
action
may
not
be
consolidated
or...
excuse
me,
not
an
implied
cause
of
action...
that
a
private
action
whether
implied
or
express
may
not
be
consolidated
with
a
commission
action
in
the
absence
of
the
consent
by
the
commission.
now,
indeed,
that
statute
does
indicate
an
awareness
but,
i
submit,
does
not
indicate
an
approval.
