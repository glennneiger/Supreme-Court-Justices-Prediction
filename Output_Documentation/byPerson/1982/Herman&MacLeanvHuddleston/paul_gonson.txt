mr.
paul
gonson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
hochfelder
case,
the
accountants
there
urged
that
they
should
not
be
liable
under
section
10(b)
for
mere
negligence.
this
court
agreed
and
held
that
scienter
was
required,
becomes
here
have
been
found
by
a
jury
to
have
acted
with
scienter.
they
ask
this
court
that
they
should
not
be
held
liable
under
section
10(b)
because
section
11
provides
for
liability
for
negligence.
and
they
also
argue
that
their
conduct
is
not
covered
under
section
11.
their
argument
is
that
congress
intended
the
section
11
be
the
exclusive
remedy
for
false
statements
in
a
registered
securities
offering
even
where
the
victims
of
that
falsity
cannot
recover
because
section
11
does
not
apply
to
the
persons
or
the
conduct
involved.
i
will
develop
two
responses.
first,
the
congress
intended
in
1975
when
it
comprehensively
amended
the
securities
and
exchange
act
to
continue
the
section
10(b)
remedy,
including
its
cumulative
nature,
and
that
the
accountants
have
not
carried
their
burden
of
demonstrating
that
congress
intended
to
carve
out
from
that
10(b)5
remedy
protection
for
buyers
for
securities
and
registered
offerings.
second,
that
the
section
11
and
10(b)
remedies
are
very
much
different.
and
an
analysis
of
those
differences
demonstrates
congress'
intent
that
they
should
coexist.
the
central
inquiry,
we
agree,
as
asked
by
justice
white,
is
legislative
intent.
and
this
court
noted
in
the
curran
case
that
the
inquiry
logically
differs
depending
upon
whether
a
court
is
considering
new
legislation
or
legislation
that
congress
amended
following
its
enactment.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
securities
acts
have
been
amended
on
a
number
of
occasions;
the
securities
exchange
act
in
1964,
1975,
and
1977.
i
will
focus
on
1975
because
in
that
year
congress
comprehensively
examined
and
strengthened
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
it
added
55
provisions
to
that
act,
amended
47
provisions,
and
left
85
provisions
unchanged.
it
established
a
new
national
market
systems,
a
new
system
to
clear
and
settle
transactions
in
securities,
and
a
new
system
bringing
municipal
securities
dealers
under
federal
regulation,
greatly
strengthen
sec
regulatory
authority
over
securities
brokers
and
securities
exchanges.
it
strengthened
the
remedies
available
for
sec
enforcement,
but
no
new
private
remedies
were
added,
nor
were
any
changes
made
in
the
express
private
remedies,
nor
was
section
10(b)
touched.
now,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
1975
the
consensus
of
judicial
opinion
regarding
the
availability
of
the
section
10(b)
private
action
was
older
and
even
more
overwhelming
than
the
development
of
the
implied
private
action
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
that
was
upheld
in
curran.
the
extensive
section
10(b)
case
law
included
many
federal
court
decisions
holding
that
a
section
10(b)
remedy
was
available
even
though
the
conduct
may
have
been
covered
by
express
remedy,
including
courts
of
appeals
decisions
from
six
circuits.
in
addition,
there
were
a
great
many
decisions
allowing
recovery
under
section
10(b)
without
any
discussion
at
all
of
whether
an
express
remedy
would
apply,
although
from
the
facts
of
those
cases
it
appears
that
such
express
remedies
probably
would
have
applied,
again
establishing
the
widespread
acceptance
of
the
cumulative
nature
of
the
10(b)
remedy.
congress
was
also
presumably
aware
in
1975
of
this
court's
statement
in
1969
in
the
national
securities
case
that
section
10(b)
was
the
most
litigated
provision
of
the
federal
securities
laws
and
that
some
overlap
in
section
10(b)
with
other
sections
is
neither
unusual
nor
inappropriate.
so
thus
for
the
same
reasons
that
congress'
reexamination
and
amendment
of
the
securities
laws
serves
to
ratify
the
existence
of
a
private
right
of
action
generally
under
section
10(b),
it
serves
also
to
ratify
conspicuous
and
a
uniformly
accepted
characteristic
of
that
right
of
action
in
1975,
its
cumulative
and
supplemental
nature.
indeed,
the
argument
for
the
cumulative
nature
of
the
10(b)
remedy
is
a
fortiori
from
curran.
there
this
court
held
that
new
remedies
added
in
1974
to
the
commodities
exchange
act,
arbitration
and
reparations,
were
limited
and
narrow
in
scope.
it
did
not
substitute
for
the
implied
remedy
either
as
a
means
of
compensating
injured
traders
or
as
a
means
of
enforcing
compliance
with
the
statute.
as
mentioned,
congress
created
no
new
remedies
in
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1975,
adding
strength
to
the
presumption
that
it
intended
to
continue
the
cumulative
nature
of
the
10(b)5
remedy
very
well
established
in
the
case
law.
in
addition
to
legislative
ratification
applying
to
the
cumulative
nature
of
the
10(b)5
remedy,
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
section
11
to
be
the
exclusive
remedy
for
investors
defrauded
in
a
registered
securities
offering.
in
section
16
of
the
securities
act
congress
stated
the
rights
and
remedies
in
that
act
shall
be
in
addition
to
any
and
all
other
rights
which
may
exist
in
law
and
equity.
and
there
is
a
similar
provision
in
the
securities
and
exchange
act.
beyond
that,
congress
declared
the
purpose
in
section
2
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
to
impose
requirements
necessary
to
securities
regulation
and
control
reasonably
complete
and
effective.
this
comported
with
president
roosevelt's
call
for
securities
legislation
with
teeth
in
it.
and
now
to
the
comparison
of
the
section
11
and
10(b)5
remedies.
section
11
is
a
remedy
which,
while
detailed,
is
quite
narrow
in
what
it
covers.
as
has
already
been
pointed
out,
it
reaches
a
list
of
direct
participants
in
an
offering
for
registering...
for
misstatements
in
a
registration
statement.
it
doesn't
reach
others
who
may
have
played
a
role
in
the
alleged
fraud,
such
as,
in
this
very
case,
accountants
other
than
with
respect
to
what
we
now
refer
to
as
the
expertised
portion
of
the
document.
to
the
extent
section
11
does
apply,
it
greatly
expands
liability
imposed
in
common
law.
it
does
not
require
proof
of
fraud.
in
ultramares,
for
example,
cited
by
this
court
in
its
hochfelder
decision,
judge
cardozo,
writing
for
the
new
york
cour
of
appeals,
held
that
accountants
owed
a
duty
to
investors
to
make
their
certificates
without
fraud
but
did
not
owe
a
duty
to
investors
to
make
that
certificate
without
negligence.
but
section
11
creates
a
duty
on
accountants
running
to
investors
to
make
their
certificate
without
negligence.
and
section
11
doesn't
require
proof
of
reliance
or
causation.
10(b)
is
more
like
the
common
law,
requiring
scienter,
causation,
and
reliance.
and
not
only
in
10(b)
must
the
plaintiff
prove
scienter,
but
he
has
the
burden
of
proving
scienter.
in
a
section
11
action
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
showing
absence
for
negligence.
as
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
ross
v.
robbins,
cited
in
our
brief,
there
is
often
a
failure
of
proof
and
the
party
who
has
the
burden
then,
of
course,
loses.
now,
because
this
remedy
under
section
11
favored
plaintiffs
so
substantially,
congress
did
not
extend
this
remedy
to
all
conduct
or
to
all
persons.
and
moreover,
to
prevent
abuse
of
the
remedy,
congress
provided
for
costs,
attorney's
fees
in
some
cases,
and
a
short
statute
of
limitations.
that,
in
a
sense,
is
the
trade-off.
our
point
is
that
because
10(b)
is
a
different
remedy
and
a
more
difficult
one
to
sustain,
if
the
plaintiff
is
able
to
sustain
it
and
proves
fraud
and
the
other
components
of
the
remedy,
then
he
ought
to
be
entitled
to
the
remedy.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
give
the
defendants
the
trade-off
advantages
of
the
short
statute,
security
for
costs
and
so
on
that
are
found
in
section
11.
indeed,
more
than
30
years
ago
fishman
v.
raytheon
pointed
out
that
the
recognition
that
section
10(b)
as
a
different
remedy
provided
the
classical
reconciliation
of
the
express
and
the
implied
remedies.
fishman
was
noted
by
this
court
in
hochfelder
where
this
court's
holding
that
scienter
is
required
under
section
10(b)
rested,
in
part,
on
the
premise
that
the
10(b)
remedy
is
cumulative
of
the
express
remedies
in
the
securities
act.
as
this
court
noted
in
hochfelder,
precisely
because
conduct
which
is
actionable
under
sections
11
and
12(2)
also
is
actionable
under
section
10(b).
adoption
of
the
negligence
standard
under
10(b),
as
was
urged
in
that
case,
would
"allow
causes
of
action
covered
by
sections
11
and
12(2)
to
be
brought
instead
under
section
10(b)
and
thereby
nullify
the
effectiveness
of
the
carefully
drawn
procedural
restrictions
on
those
express
actions.
"
"so
this
overlap
provided
a
reason
for
a
higher
culpability
standard
under
section
10(b).
"
i
close
on
the
point
i
opened
with:
the
defendant
is
an
accounting
firm.
it
is
one
of
the
persons
who
can
be
sued
under
section
11,
but
only
as
an
expert,
where
their
conduct
is
alleged
to
have
gone...
to
go
much
beyond
that.
mr.
truitt
referred
to
allegations.
the
jury
found
that.
there
should
not...
it
is
difficult
to
impute
to
congress
an
intention
that
the
law
in
some
cases
should
provide
a
remedy
for
negligence--
mr.
paul
gonson
--thank
you,
your
honor.
