mr.
truitt,
may
i
ask,
under
your
view,
what
remedy
you
think
a
defrauded
purchaser
of
registered
securities
would
have?
does
that
person
have
a
10(b)5
implied
action,
do
you
think,
or
only
if
he
doesn't
have
a
section
11
remedy,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
do
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
applied
to
proof
of
knowledge
or
scienter
only
or
to
proof
of
all
the
elements
of
the
10(b)--
