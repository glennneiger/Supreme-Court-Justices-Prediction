justice
thurgood
marshall
the
first
two
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
they
raised
two
issues
concerning
the
general
antifraud
provisions
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
specifically
section
10(b).
section
10(b)
prohibits
the
use
of
any
fraudulent
devised
by
any
person
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.
we
have
long
recognized
that
private
parties
can
bring
an
action
for
damages
based
on
section
10(b).
the
first
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
private
right
of
action
exists
under
10(b)
for
fraudulent
activities
when
the
conduct
may
also
be
expressly
attributable
under
a
separate
provision
of
a
related
act,
section
11
of
the
securities
act
of
1933.
section
11
is
a
narrowly
tale
of
provision
that
permits
a
purchaser
of
registered
securities
to
bring
an
action
against
certain
specific
parties
to
a
misstatement
or
omissions
contained
in
the
registrations
statement.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
availability
of
an
expressed
remedy
under
section
11
of
the
1933
act
did
not
borrow
suit
for
damages
under
10(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
we
affirm
that
holding.
section
11
of
the
1933
act
were
designed
to
a
four
special
protection
to
purchasers
of
registered
securities
but
would
be
anomalous
to
deprive
such
purchasers
of
the
protection
against
fraud
when
section
10(b)
of
the
1934
act
provided
to
all
persons
who
deal
in
securities.
the
two
actions
are
distinct
and
address
different
types
of
wrongdoing.
they
may
overlap
on
occasion
but
our
private
--
our
prior
decisions
have
permitted
such
overlap
under
the
security
laws.
the
second
issue
in
these
cases
involves
the
standard
of
proof
applicable
under
an
action
under
10(b).
in
a
typical
civil
suit
for
money
damages,
the
plaintiff
must
prove
their
case
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
plaintiff
in
a
10(b)
action
must
establish
his
case
by
a
higher
standard
“clear
and
convincing”
evidence.
we
reverse
this
holding.
the
higher
standard
of
proof
may
have
been
applied
historically
in
certain
kind
of
law
fraud
actions,
but
these
suits
have
little
relevance
to
modern
actions
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
we
have
only
required
a
higher
standard
of
proof
when
particularly
important
individual
rights
are
at
stake,
such
as
in
deportation
proceeding,
but
here,
the
balance
of
interest
rate
was
a
traditional
standard
of
proof.
accordingly,
the
general
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part
and
otherwise
a
mandate
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
