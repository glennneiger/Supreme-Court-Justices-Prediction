justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
term
of
art,
"go-go
period"
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--can
we
find
it
in
west's
law
or
someplace
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
told
me
what
it
is
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
told
me
what
it
is
yet.
i
would
like
to
know
if
you
are
going
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
now
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
have
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
likely
would
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
the
question
with
respect
to
those
defendants
who
are
subject
to
liability
under
section
11,
is
the
question
whether
congress
intended
their
liability
under
that
section
to
be
exclusive?
is
that
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
that's
just
a
reason
for
saying
congress
didn't
intend
their
liability
to
be
exclusive
under
that
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
provide
for
it
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
have
section
11
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
stuck?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
so
under
another
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
has
got
to
be
more
than
negligent?
