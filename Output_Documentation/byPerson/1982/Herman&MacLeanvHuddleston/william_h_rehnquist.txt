justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
"expertised"
mean?
we
are
getting
an
education.
what
does
mr.
truitt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
theory
on
which
they
do
that,
on
which
the
plaintiffs
seek
to
assess
liability
against
the
accountants
for
something
like
that
which
was
done--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
does
the
concept
of
aiders
and
abettors
in
civil
litigation
come
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
any
of
the
relevant
securities
acts
passed
by
congress
use
the
term
"aiders
and
abettors"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
a
federal
judge
demand
that
a
suit
be
settled
before
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
implied
sanction
which
the
judge
has
to
back
up
what
you
describe
as
a
"demand"?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
isn't
the
common
law
standard
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
in
an
action
for
civil
fraud
across
the
board
as
to
all
the
elements
with
respect
to
which
the
plaintiff
bears
the
burden
of
proof?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
but
in
those
states
where
there
is
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
isn't
it
all
elements,
just
as
i
presume
in
new
jersey
it's
all
elements--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but,
mr.
jaffe,
this
is
a
question
that
might
just
as
well
be
put
to
your
opponent
as
to
you
and
perhaps
is
not
proper
in
light
of
some
of
our
court's
decisions.
but
how
many
juries
do
you
think
would
reach
a
different
result
if
they're
charged
that
you
have
to
find
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
as
opposed
to
a
preponderance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
your
feeling
is
certainly
understandable
in
view
of
their
verdict?
[laughter]
