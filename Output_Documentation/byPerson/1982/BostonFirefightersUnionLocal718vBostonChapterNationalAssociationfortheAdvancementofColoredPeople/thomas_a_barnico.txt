mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
appears
here
today
seeking
reversal
of
orders
entered
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
on
august
7,
1981.
we
thus
seek
the
same
result
as
the
union
petitioners
in
these
cases.
to
accomplish
that
result,
however,
we
bring
a
different
appeal
and
different
arguments
before
the
court.
we
appeal
from
the
unjustified
suspension
of
a
massachusetts
law
that
requires
that
layoffs
in
public
safety
positions
be
made
in
reverse
order
of
seniority.
after
briefly
stating
these
cases,
it
is
my
intention
to
argue
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
by
suspending
that
law
where
no
previous
orders
or
decrees
entered
in
these
cases
concerned
layoffs
and
where
entry
of
the
orders
contradicted
principles
of
federalism
that
govern
the
exercise
of
the
federal
equity
power.
the
orders
at
issues
were
entered
in
on-going
cases
with
long
judicial
histories
and
state-wide
application.
ten
years
ago
the
district
courts
in
these
cases
entered
judgments
and
found
that
state
examination
procedures
for
police
and
fire
positions
unintentionally,
and
i
repeat,
unintentionally
violated
the
rights
of
the
plaintiffs.
remedial
orders
were
entered.
those
orders
required
a
new
examination
and
also
required
preferential
certification
of
minorities
to
local
cities
and
towns.
as
a
result
of
the
preferential
certifications,
the
percentage
of
minorities
in
massachusetts
city
and
town
police
and
fired
forces
increased
substantially.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
orders
that
were
entered
in
august
of
1981,
your
honor,
or
the--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--the
subsequent
decrees
entered
shortly
after
those
original
findings
to
provide
for
the
remedial
phase
of
the
cases
applied
to
the
cities
and
towns
until
the
percentages
of
minorities
reach
a
percentage
commensurate
with
the
percentage
in
the
community.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
not
in
boston,
your
honor,
but
in
many
communities,
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
summer
of
1981,
boston
proposed
layoffs
in
its
police
and
fire
departments.
the
district
court
granted
what
plaintiffs
styled
a
motion
to
modify
prior
remedial
orders.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
our
view...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
our
view
is
by
its
terms
it
has
permanent
application.
that
order
of
august
7,
1981
directed
city
and
state
officials
to
ignore
the
provisions
of
the
state
seniority
statute,
never
challenged
and
never
at
issue--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--yes,
your
honor,
that
legislation
was
passed
in
june
of
1982.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
you
have
a
live
case
here,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
these
cases--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--the
state
is
aggrieved
and--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--the
firefighters
and
police
officers
laid
off
in
the
summer
of
1981
were
reinstated
by
the
terms
of
that
legislation,
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
we
have
a
live
case
here,
your
honor,
because
the
state
defendants
have
been
parties
to
this
case
for
over
ten
years,
are
still
subject
to
the
outstanding
terms
of
those
orders.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
excuse
me?
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mcmahon
could
speak
to
the
permanent
effect
of
the
orders
on
those
back-pay
claims.
since
i
represent
the
state
defendants,
i
rely
on
the
outstanding
effect
of
the
orders
on
the
state
officials.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
orders
of
august
7,
1981,
by
their
terms
apply
to
any
program
for
reduction
in
force.
they
also
apply
currently
to
the
administrative
appeals
brought
by
the
terminated
officers
that
are
now
pending
before
the
civil
service
commission.
in
addition,
your
honor,
we
have
a
third
argument
and
that
is
simply
that
these
cases
continue
in
the
district
court.
we
are
still
subject
to
the
underlying
judgments
of
these
cases.
and,
when
we
return
from
this
case,
the
cases
that
i
mentioned
before
live
with
on-going--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--i
am
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
is
correct.
boston
proposed
layoffs
and
the
issue
was
whether
the
seniority
statute
of
massachusetts
should
govern
the
layoffs
last
time
and--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--the
orders
said
that
the
statute
would
be
ignored
and
percentages...
any
program
of
reduction
in
force
should
be
maintained.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
as
i
said,
your
honor,
there
is
a
current
effect
on
the
civil
service
commission's
adjudication
of
their
appeals.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
that
is
right.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
back
pay
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
controversy
continues
for
those
reasons
that
i
gave
earlier.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
your
honor,
these
cases--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--seniority
only
to
the
time
of
determination.
i
think
mr.
mcmahon
could--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--well,
mr.
mcmahon,
i
think,
could
clarify
that
position,
but
the
back
pay
issue
still
remains
so
that
when
justice
stevens
suggested
that
all
issues
were
taken
care
by
the
reinstatement,
i
add
that
the
back
pay
question
still
remains.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
state
is
an
adjudicator
actually,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
the
commission
will
decide
whether
the
city
will
actually
pay
the
back
pay.
these
cases
pose
important--
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that
continuing
effect
keeps
this
case
alive
before
this
court.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
but,
currently,
your
honor,
the
civil
service
commission
is
prevented
from
even
considering
the
question
of
seniority
in
the
back
pay
and
termination
appeals.
we
are
asking,
as
the
state
adjudicator,
to
be
free
from
an
order
which
currently
prohibits
us
from
making
an
inquiry
that
we
are
bound
to
make
under
the
state
law.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
but,
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
continuing
and
permanent
effect
on
the
state
petitioners
before
you
vacate
these
orders,
vacate
this
case
and
instruct
to
dismiss.
you
can
only
invoke
munsingwear
procedure
so-called
once
you
determine
that
there
is
no
current
and
no
permanent
effect
on
the
state
officials.
and,
we
argue,
of
course,
that
there
is.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
and
that
procedure
that
has
been
used
in
the
past
has
often
been
used
to
vacate
the
underlying
judgments
with
instructions
to
dismiss
which
is
far
different
than
here.
in
this
case,
you
will
not
hear
plaintiffs'
respondents
ask
the
court
to
vacate
the
underlying
judgments
because
those
continue
and
they
have
orders
which
effect
examinations
and
certifications
in
the
future.
my
time
is
expiring
but
my
case
is
not,
i
assure
you.
[laughter]
previous
school
desegregation
and
employment
discrimination
cases
decided
by
this
court
have
required
states
to
address
particular
instances
of
racial
discrimination.
in
these
cases,
implementation
of
a
neutral
testing
device
and
the
hiring
preferences
created
in
the
system
redress
specific
wrongs
and
vindicated
entitlements.
that
entitlement,
however,
didn't
constitute
a
predicate
to
the
most
recent
orders
which
extended
the
remedy.
the
district
court
ignored
fundamental
and
affirmative
limitations
on
the
judicial
power.
the
district
court
ordered
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
approved
a
decree
that
transcended
all
previous
orders
that
were
ever
entered
in
these
cases
and
suspended
a
valid
state
law.
in
closing,
we
acknowledge
the
competing
interests
that
are
pitted
and
the
important
questions
that
are
posed
by
these
cases.
the
district
court
judge
heard
argument
from
these
interests.
he
weighed
these
issues.
out
of
sheer
exasperation,
i
think,
at
one
point
in
the
oral
argument
of
the
case,
he
looked
at
the
parties
below
him
and
commented
that
no
party
had
asked
him
to
retain
the
best
policemen
or
the
best
firemen.
but,
faced
with
those
issues,
he
was
not
free
to
impose
his
own
view
of
who
should
be
retained.
he
was
bound
by
this
court's
previous
determination
limiting
the
scope
of
the
equity
power
to
violations
previously
found.
he
was
bound
by
congress'
express
protection
of
bona
fide
seniority
systems
and
he
was
bound
by
principles
of
federalism
that
prohibited
him
from
suspending
a
state
law
never
challenged
and
never
at
issue
in
these
cases.
he
ignored
those
rules
and
his
orders
must,
therefore,
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
conclude
here.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
a.
barnico
no.
thank
you,
your
honor.
