mr.
barnico,
were
those
original
orders
entered
of
indefinite
duration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
the
original...
sometime
in
the
'70's.
i
don't
know
when
it
was.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
has
that
percentage
yet
been
reached?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
as
far
as
boston
is
concerned,
the
decree
entered
in
the
'70's
still
has
considerable
prospective
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
city
under
the...
or
rather
the
civil
service
commission
under
the
modification
of
1981
is
subject
to
an
express
paragraph,
is
it
not,
of
the
modification
limiting
the
authority
of
the
civil
service
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
take
it
we
would
have
to
vacate
the
entire
decree
if
it
is
moot,
wouldn't
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
including
the
1970
portion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcmahon,
what
is
your
theory
on
how
703(h)
gets
into
this
case
since
the
action
wasn't
brought
under
title
vii?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dittmar,
wouldn't
you
say
that
the
state
could
represent
the
civil
service
commissioners?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
they
are
subject
to
paragraph
four
of
judge
caffrey's
decree,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dittmar,
do
you
know
of
any
case
similar
to
this
where
there
has
been
an
underlying
controversy
that
is
the
subject
of
a
basic
decree
and
then
there
is
a
modification
of
the
decree
and
we
have
simply
said,
well,
this
branch
of
the
case
is
moot
but
the
underlying
controversy
isn't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
ask
mr.
carpenter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
allow
me
to
finish
my
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
really
asking
us
to
go
into
kind
of
a
new
departure,
aren't
you,
where
the
basic
underlying
case
is
not
moot,
to
simply
prune
off
a
little
branch
of
it
and
say,
because
it
is
moot,
the
whole
thing
is
vacated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
underlying
controversy
is
whether
there
should
be
a
minority
quota
requirement
in
the
boston
policy
and
fire
systems,
isn't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
has
been
resolved
by
the
district
court
decree
in
the
'70's.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
was
the
original
decree
entered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
opposing
counsel
said
that
that
decree
had
not
terminated
so
far
as
the
city
of
boston
was
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
that
is
a
live
controversy,
any
modification
of
it
is
a
live
controversy
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
we
decide
mootness
in
terms
of
cases
or
controversies,
not
in
terms
of
orders.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
"clearly
identified
at
the
outset",
what
do
you
mean?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
if
they
took
and
passed
the
examination--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
certainly
before
the
court
in
the
sense
that
when
we
get
to
the
merits
of
reviewing
the
district
court's
injunction
against
firing.
it
might
make
some
difference
as
to
whether
the
district
court
acted
properly
if
all
of
the
hirees
under
the
minority
program
had,
in
fact,
been
discriminated
against
or
if
some
of
the
hirees
had
never
been
the
victims
of
discrimination.
if
that
weren't
the
case,
i
doubt
there
would
be
a
case
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think...
i
know
as
much
about
the
complexity
on
that
particular
issue,
i
think,
as
i
need
to
know.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
reason
for
paragraph
four
of
judge
caffrey's
order
where
it
says
in
the
event
that
a
police
officer's
appeal
of
his
termination
to
the
members
of
the
civil
service
commission
challenges
the
method
of
termination
set
forth
herein.
the
members
of
the
civil
service
commission
are
restrained
and
enjoined
from
disapproving,
invalidating,
or
interfering
with
the
termination
on
that
basis?
