mr.
james
s.
dittmar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
because
the
court
voiced
almost
with
one
voice
a
concern
about
mootness,
i
would
like
to
address
that
issue
briefly.
it
is
a
threshold
issue.
as
the
suggestion
of
mootness,
which
we
incorporated
in
our
brief
in
the
merits,
indicates
we
view
this
case
to
be
moot.
a
massachusetts'
act
of
1982,
chapter
190
which
was
passed
approximately
one
month
after
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court
decision,
mandates
that
all
officers
in
both
departments
who
were
discharged
during
the
reduction-in-force
program
in
1981
be
rehired.
it
also,
modifying
what
would
otherwise
be
standard
principles
of
civil
service
law,
specifies
that
all
of
these
individuals
who
were
laid
off
and
then
rehired
have
lifetime
job
security
from
layoffs
for
lack
of
funds
or
reduction-in-force
programs.
in
addition,
the
city
of
boston
has
begun
rehiring
additional
officers
over
the
last
approximately
nine
months
under
mandates
also
coming
from
that
same
statute
to
raise
and
maintain
levels
of
staffing
in
the
two
departments.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
additional
hiring.
i
did
misspeak.
the
case,
we
believe,
is
moot.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
the
back
pay
is
now,
to
my
understanding,
in
some
instances
pending
before
the
civil
service
commission.
the
pendency
of
that
claim,
however,
does
not
make
this
controversy
before
this
court
still
a
live
controversy.
the
parties
to
that
back-pay
claim
are
not
before
this
court.
indeed,
on
our
side
of
defense
in
this
court
we
have
no
complaint
whatsoever
whether
the
officers
receive
back
pay.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
the
state
could
represent
the
civil
service
commissioners
but
they
sit
as
an
adjudicator
party.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
paragraph
four
of
judge
caffrey's
decree
has,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
has
expired,
because
there
are
no
longer
any
terminations
or
layoffs
with
which
the
civil
service
officials
could
in
any
way
interfere
by
any
action
that
they
take.
moreover,
your
honor,
this
court
nor
the
lower
court
on
any
remand
following
any
action
on
the
merits
can
issue
no
relief
that
has
any
bearing
upon
that
back-pay
claim.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
i
don't
see
how
the
civil
service
commission
could
deny
a
back-pay
claim
because
an
order
which
was
valid
and
not
reversed
nor
vacated
at
the
time
it
was
in
effect
is
subsequently
reversed
on
appeal.
i
believe,
if
anything
in
terms
of
alleviating
what
might
be
perceived
as
a
hinderance
on
the
part
of
the
civil
service
commission,
a
vacation
for
mootness
grants
them
greater
freedom,
because
that
vacates
the
order.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--i
believe
all
of
the
cases
in
which
a
corollary...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
sure.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
no,
quite
the
contrary.
the
basic
underlying
controversy
is
moot
and
my
brethren
are
asking
to
have
you...
because
they
say
there
is
a
little
branch
off
to
the
side
that
is
still
alive
keeps
the
underlying
controversy
alive.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
that
has
been
resolved
by
the
statute.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
well,
as
between...
i
am
sorry,
in
the
'70's,
no,
not
in
the
'70's.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
the
original
decrees,
the
original
decrees
were
in
the
early
'70's,
that
is
true,
but
those
decrees
terminate
by
their
own
terms
once
any
hiring
authority
achieves
a
percentage
representation
of
firefighters
or
police
officers.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
that
is
correct,
but
that
decree
is
not
before
this
court.
none
of
the
parties
to
this
proceeding
have
challenged
any
of
the
original
decrees.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
only
controversy
that
is
here
before
this
court
is
whether
the
modification
was
proper.
the
fact
that
there
is
an
underlying
lawsuit
with
on-going
remedial
measures
in
place
which
are
not
being
challenged,
stays
in
place,
doesn't
make
the
order
which
has
brought
us
all
before
the
court
here
a
live
controversy.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
you
decide
it
in
terms
of...
that
is
true.
there
is...
the
court
has...
the
lower
court
has
continuing
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
but
the
order,
as
to
which
certiorari
was
granted
coming
up
to
this
court,
does
no
longer
represent
a
live
controversy.
that
issue,
the
relief
that
is
sought,
the
controversy,
the
challenges
to
that
relief,
the
arguments
in
support
of
that
relief
are
not
longer
live.
all
of
the
officers
have
been
rehired
and
they
have
all
been
given
permanent
civil
service
job
security
by
virtue
of
statute.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
i
disagree
with
that.
i
understand
that
that
is
their
contention.
i
believe
on
the
face
of
the
order,
your
honor,
it
is
plainly
not
a
permanent
order.
it
was
argued
for
an
entered
to
address
a
specific
reduction-in-force
program
that
took
place
in
the
summer
of
1981.
if
it
were,
indeed,
a
permanent
order
ordering
that
the
city
of
boston
maintains
specific
racial
percentages
indefinitely,
and
in
that
sense,
permanent
as
is
now
contended,
it
surely
would
have
been
challenged
on
the
merits
as
a
matter
of
substantive
and
remedial
law
in
the
lower
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
the
swann,
charlotte,
mecklenberg
case
and
under
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
the
pasadena
board
of
education-spangler
case
and
it
was
never
raised.
there
was
never
any
attack
on
the
invalidity
of
the
order
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
because
it
set
a
permanent
racial
quota,
a
permanent
racial
maintenance
level,
until
that
issue
was
raised
to
defeat
the
suggestion
of
mootness
in
this
court.
and,
if
you
look
at
the
terms
of
the
order,
the
language,
any
reduction-in-force
program
is
plainly
in
there
in
order
to
avoid
any
problems
of
evasion
by
the
manner
in
which
in
the
summer
of
1981
on
the
factual
record
before
the
court
be
programmed
or
structured
in
a
way
that
would
avoid
the
prohibition
of
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
the
legislation
ordering
reinstatement
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
court's
order
except
that
it
followed
the
court's
order.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
was
it
consistent
with
the
court's
order?
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
it
lead
to
the
same...
it
lead
to
a
consistent
result,
that
is
true,
in
the
sense
that--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--no,
no.
the
court
simply
ordered
that
during
the
reduction-in-force
program
the
level
of
minority
representation
obtained
at
the
outset
of
that
program
be
maintained.
the
city
went
ahead
with
a
reduction-in-force
program,
laid
off
a
certain
number
of
minority
and
a
certain
number
of
non-minority
officers
and
then
completed
its
program.
then,
the
legislature
specified
that
everyone
who
had
been
laid
off
should
be
rehired
and
that
additional
staffing
minimums
be
maintained
and
that
would
simply
bring
the
level
of
officers
back
to
where
they
were
before
we
all
started
plus
a
little
bit
more.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
in
the
same
ratio,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
i
can't
answer
your
question
as--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
well,
i
suppose
having
put
the
suggestion
of
mootness
into
the
brief,
i
would
have
to
say,
yes,
we
are
just
as
content.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
responsibility
to
the
court
in
laying
out
the
full
dimensions
of
the
present
circumstances
to
the
court.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
just
that
one
order,
that
is
correct.
and,
i
believe--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--the
rest
of
the
case
remains
alive,
that
is
correct.
i
believe
justice
rehnquist's
suggestion
or
illusion
to...
in
any
kind
of
vacation
in
the
event
of
a
determination
by
this
court
of
mootness,
that
that
vacation
would
effect
to
any
prior
orders.
i
don't
think
that
is
properly
before
the
court
now.
the
only
thing
that
is
before
the
court
is
the
challenge
by
the
certiorari
petitioners
to
the
relief
embodied
in
the
august
7,
1981
order.
indeed,
all
parties
to
this
case
expressly,
expressly
disclaimed
any
challenge
either
to
the
original
judgment
or
to
the
remedial
measures
that
were
in
place
prior
to
august
of
1981.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it
would
have
been
beyond
the
court's
power
to
do
so,
but
i
believe
that
it
would
not
have
been
a
sound
exercise
in
discretion.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
because
i
think
that
in
exercising
discretion
for
remedial
purposes
to
remedy
the
exclusion
of
minorities
from
public
service
a
court
should
be
very
careful
to
consider
the
actual
circumstances
obtaining
before
it,
to
consider
what
extent
of
relief
has
been
accorded
under
the
on-going
remedial
program
which
is
incomplete,
how
far
along
the
remedy
is,
the
extent
of
the
imposition
or
the
frustration
of
the
remedy,
which
an
otherwise
proposed
governmental
action
would
work,
the
burden
that
any
particular
order
would
place
upon
third-party
employees,
and
factors
of
that
sort.
i
don't
believe
that
that
kind
of
set
of
considerations
ought
to
be
considered
in
the
abstract
and
ought
to
be
laid
down
in
advance.
those
ought
to
be
taken
as
the
case
proceeds
in
precisely
the
fashion
in
which
the
district
court...
chief
judge
caffrey
of
the
district
court
did
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
if
the
case
is
not
moot,
i
would
like
to
address
the
merits,
yes,
your
honor.
the
order
that
is
under
review
on
the
merits
is
an
order
that
arises
out
of
a
case
in
which,
through
the
operation
of
massachusetts
civil
service
practices,
minorities
had
been
unconstitutionally
excluded
historically
from
the
police
and
fire
departments
of
the
city
of
boston.
the
district
court
in
both
of
these
cases
in
the
early
1970's
adjudicated
that
minorities
had
been
unconstitutionally
excluded
from
these
two
departments.
a
remedial
program
was
put
in
place
in
order
to
correct
the
effects,
the
condition
of
exclusion
which
these
past
practices
have
brought
about.
the
city
and
the
state
civil
service
officials
were
bound
to
participate
in
that
remedial
program.
it
was
an
order
of
the
court
to
remedy
this
condition
which
the
discrimination
had
accomplished
and
ultimately
they
entered
into
consent
orders
with
respect
to
both
of
the
cases.
the
program
was
on-going
when,
in
the
summer
of
1981,
the
city
of
boston
proposed
and
started
implementing
a
program
such
that
in
six
weeks
approximately
one-half
of
all
black
and
hispanic
firemen
in
the
city
of
boston
and
one-half
of
all
black
and
hispanic
police
officers
were
going
to
be
laid
off.
another
way
of
putting
it
is
approximately
one-half
of
all
of
the
officers
in
both
departments
who
had
been
hired
under
the
remedial
phase
yet
to
be
completed
ordered
by
the
court
were
going
to
be
laid
off.
the
court's
order
came
in
that
context
and
the
court's
order
said
you
may
not
reduce
the
present
percentage
representation
levels
if
you
pursue
this
reduction-in-force
program
which
has
been
placed
before
me
with
statistics
indicating
its
scope
and
impact.
i
believe
the
order
was
proper
and
the
issue
before
the
court
on
the
merits
is
whether
the
district
court
had
the
power
to
issue
such
an
order
to
maintain
and
protect
and
promote
the
original
purposes
of
its
remedial
orders
going
back
to
the
original
adjudications
of
liability
and
whether,
in
this
particular
instance
on
the
matters
and
record
before
the
court,
there
was
a
sound
and
proper
exercise
of
discretion.
i
believe
the
answer
to
both
questions
is
the
court
had
its
power,
had
the
power
and
the
court
properly
exercised
discretion.
my
starting
point
is
that
having
adjudicated
discriminatory
exclusion
of
minorities
from
a
public
governmental
agency,
in
this
case
public
services
agencies,
the
court
has
the
power
to
remedy
the
effects,
the
exclusion
that
the
past
practices
has
brought
about.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
they
started
out
from
scratch,
your
honor.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
two
things,
your
honor.
one,
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
jump
them
up
over
anyone
else
with
a
kind
of
rightful
place,
retroactive
seniority
that
the
court
has
spoken
about
in
several
cases.
and,
equally
significant,
no
attempt
was
made
to
identify,
to
give
notice
to
or
bring
before
the
court
and
adjudicate
who
they
were
out
there
who
had
been
deterred
by
years
and
years
of
exclusion
of
minorities.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
it
was
a
proper
form
of
relief,
however,
in
large
part
because
what
we
had
had
in
the
past
is
we
had
had
the
exclusion
of
minorities
from
the
police
and
fire
departments
and
the
original
remedies,
the
original
remedies
were
the
predicate
for
the
modification.
the
original
remedies
had
been
themselves
a
flexible
compromise
between
the
interests
of
those
who
had
been
discriminated
against,
those
who
were
also
already
in
these
various
forces
and
who
would
be
jumped
over
at
the
time,
and
the
interests
of
the
municipal
authorities
in
managing,
as
much
as
possible
in
the
ordinary
fashion,
their
hiring
and
operations
of
their
departments.
when
the
layoffs
came
in
1981,
however,
because
there
had
been
no
wholesale
attempt
to
locate
and
give
a
remedy
to
all
of
the
victims
of
discrimination
originally
or
even
to
give
a
full
rightful
place,
retroactive
seniority
remedy
to
those
who
were
clearly
identified
at
the
outset,
the
court
once
again,
i
believe,
used
flexibility
to--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--that
would
have
been
individuals
who
had
taken
and
passed
discriminatory
examinations
and
who
could
be
counted...
whose
noses
could
be
counted
so
to
speak.
but,
this
court--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--took
and
failed
the
examination.
did
i
misspeak?
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
took
and
failed
the
old
examinations.
the
unions--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--what
i
am
arguing
for,
your
honor,
is
flexibility
for
the
district
court
in
fashioning
remedies
to
remedy
the
effects
of
long-standing
exclusion
of
racial
minorities
from
government
service.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
no,
no,
no,
no.
many
who
were
hired
were
discriminated
against,
many
who
never
got
hired--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--themselves
were
victims
of
discrimination.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
during
the
remedial
phase--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--if
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
that
there
was
an
element
of
the
original
remedial
measures
was
an
affirmative
action
type
of
order,
that
is
the
case.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
that
is
the
case.
that
is
not
now
before
the
court,
but
that
is,
indeed,
an
accurate
description
of
the
original
orders.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
except
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
complexity
in
this.
for
example--
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
--one
of
the
issues
here
is
that
everyone
who
ultimately
was
hired
had
to
take
civil
service
examinations
and
these
civil
service
examinations
were
never
validated
ever.
and,
in
fact,
given
the
results
over
the
years,
even
since
the
original
decrees,
of
those
examinations
under
eeoc
standards,
they
would
be
prima
facie
invalid
exams.
in
a
sense,
almost
every
minority
applicant
and
ultimately
hiree
during
the
course
of
remediation
here
has
been
a
victim
of
the
same
type
of
discrimination
that
prompted
this
litigation
at
the
outset.
but,
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
confronted
back
in
the
early
1970's
with
governmental
practices
which
had
resulted
in
an
exclusion,
a
dramatic,
virtually
wholesale
exclusion
of
minorities
from
public
service,
public
safety
forces
and
then
confronted
with
an
effort
in
1981
to
go
back
a
great
half
step
of
the
whole
step
that
had
been
taken,
what
was
the
proper
extent
of
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
effect
a
remedy?
and,
i
believe
the
proper
extent
is
defined
by
a
number
of
the
opinions
of
the
justices
of
this
court
indicating
that
race
conscious,
affirmative,
if
you
will,
remedies,
without
requiring
nose
counting
proof
of
individual
victimization,
are
appropriate
where
there
has
been
an
adjudication
by
a
competent
tribunal
looking
at
the
specific
situation
which
is
going
to
be
affected
by
the
remedial
measure
that
there
has
been
unconstitutional
discrimination
and
that
we
have
here.
we
have
it
in
the
original
findings
of
this
court.
the
court
chose
at
the
outset
a
remedial
measure
designed
not
to
leap
over
everyone
who
was
already
there
and
give
the
minorities
who
had
been
discriminated
against
their
rightful
place,
not
even
to
go
out
and
find
all
of
the
minorities
who
had
been
excluded,
but
to
work
some
balance
and
that
balance
was
an
affirmative
action
program.
and,
i
suggest
that
is
an
appropriate
balance
for
a
court
to
strike
in
issuing
a
remedial
or
designing
a
remedial
program.
and,
that
program
was
in
effect
for
a
number
of
years.
it
was
on-going.
the
parties
were
committed
to
it.
then,
in
1981,
the
city
of
boston,
one
of
the
parties
to
that
program,
backed
out
and
said
one-half
of
everyone
who
has
been
hired
we
are
going
to
lay
off
in
six
weeks.
and,
the
court
at
that
time
took
what
i
believe
was
another
flexible
step
to
preserve
the
remedial
program
which
was
incomplete
and
to
promote
the
original
objectives.
it
didn't
advance
the
interests
of
blacks
and
hispanics
over
whites
in
absolute
numbers.
it
didn't
prohibit
any
layoffs
of
minorities.
the
burden
of
the
layoff
program
which
was
instituted
by
the
city
of
boston
fell
on
minorities
as
well
as
on
white
officers.
the
court
did
not
take
away
from
the
city
of
boston
or
the
state
civil
service
officials
for
that
matter
their
powers
and
prerogatives
to
make
the
decisions
that
they
felt
were
appropriate.
the
court
did
not...
the
city
of
boston,
by
the
way,
and
its
police
commissioner
and
its
fire
commissioner
did
not
oppose
the
relief
that
we
sought
in
the
district
court,
did
not
participate
in
the
appeal
even
and
are
obviously
not
before
this
court
today.
there
was
no
trammeling
of
the
interests
of
local
government
in
managing
its
own
affairs.
the
program
was
a
balanced
program
to
the
extent
to
which
the
court's
order
addressed
the
operation
of
a
civil
service
system.
in
fact,
it
provided
that
that
system
should
be
preserved
as
much
as
possible.
the
court's
order
specifically
provided
that
any
individuals
who
were
laid
off
in
accordance
with
the
prohibitory
terms
of
the
order
during
the
course
of
that
program
the
representation
levels
be
maintained
and
even
those
individuals
who
were
laid
off,
they
should
get
restored
to
service
with
full
seniority
as
of
the
time
they
were
laid
off.
and,
indeed,
that
is
exactly
what
happened.
mr.
james
s.
dittmar
the
purpose
of
that
provision,
your
honor,
was
to
insure
that
as
a
matter
of
state
civil
service
law,
if
there
was
compliance
by
the
city
with
the
order,
the
civil
service
commission
would
not
overturn
that
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
require
the
layoffs
of
minorities
in
contravention
of
the
court's
order.
the
court's
order
was
simply...
has
as
it
essence
only
one
provision
and
that
was
that
during
that
program,
and
only
during
that
program,
minority
percentages
be
maintained.
the
other
provisions
of
the
order
were
designed
to
insure
that
that
not
be
sabotaged,
that
is
all.
and,
for
that
matter,
your
honor,
that
provision,
in
my
opinion,
has
no
continuing
validity,
no
continuing
vitality,
i
am
sorry,
i
should
say.
now,
one
other
point
that
is
raised
by
the
unions
is
that
the
burden
of
the
court's
order
falls
on
third
parties.
that
is
true.
i
believe
this
court's
orders
have
clearly
established
that
where
the
highest
national
priority
of
remedying
race
discrimination,
and
in
this
case
we
have
virtually,
as
i
have
said,
exclusion
of
minorities
from
the
police
and
fire
departments
of
the
city
of
boston.
it
is
appropriate
for
third
parties
to
share
that
burden.
it
didn't
fall
all
on
them
as
i
have
pointed
out.
minorities
were
laid
off
and
the
court
was
careful
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
the
provisions
of
the
state
civil
service
seniority
scheme
of
things
in
the
event
of
the
very
kind
of
thing
which
happened
which
was
the
political
solution
to
these
problems
which
was
frustrated
until
the
day
after
the
district
court
order
came
down
was
ultimately
lifted
and
a
resolution
was
found.
seniority
expectations
after
all
are
not
vested
rights.
in
massachusetts
they
are
defeasible
at
any
time
by
will
of
the
legislature.
we
don't
have
involved
here
collective
bargaining
agreements
which
is
the
fruit
of
collective
bargaining
efforts
or
organized
labor.
we
don't
have
an
interference
with
national
policies
favoring
collective
bargaining
arrangements.
in
short,
the
extent
of
burden
that
the
order
places
on
others
is
within
the
permissible
scope
of
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
took
care
not
to
step
any
further
than
it
had
to.
i
would
like
to
just
conclude
by
pointing
out
that
the
efforts
in
this
country
through
legal
measures
to
eradicate
several
hundreds
years
of
race
discrimination
are
not
many
years
old,
barely
25
years,
and
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
what
this
court
has
done
by
way
of
giving
direction
to
the
lower
courts
is
to
vest
the
lower
courts
with
flexibility
to
deal
with
the
very
difficult
circumstances,
practical,
political,
and
economic,
that
they
face.
i
believe
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
exercised
that
kind
of
flexibility
wisely
and
i
urge
the
court
to
affirm
and
not
deprive
the
lower
courts
of
the
needed
flexibility
to
meet
this
pressing
national
challenge.
thank
you.
