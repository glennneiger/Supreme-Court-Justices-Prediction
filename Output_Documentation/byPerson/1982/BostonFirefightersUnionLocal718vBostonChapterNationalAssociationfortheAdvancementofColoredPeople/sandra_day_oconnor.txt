should
the

here
today,
having
to
do
with
the
layoffs,
be
interpreted
as
having
a
permanent
effect
in
your
view?

the
respondents
contended,
and
some
copy
of
a
civil
service
commission
decision
is
attached,
to
indicated
that
our
decision
here
will
have
no
effect
on
the
back
pay
and
that
is
being
resolved
on
different
grounds.
justice

but,
according
to
the
petitioners,
it
is
a
permanent
order
and
any
future
action
by
the
city
or
those
governed
by
the
order
will
have
to
be
taken
in
conformity
with
it.
