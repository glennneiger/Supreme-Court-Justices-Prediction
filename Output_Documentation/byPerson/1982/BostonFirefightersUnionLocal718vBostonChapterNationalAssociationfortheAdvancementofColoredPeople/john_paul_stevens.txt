but
neither
is
seniority.
there
is
a
controversy,
i
take
it,
that
goes
on
under
the
decree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
reinstatement
included
too
with
full
seniority,
isn't
it?
everybody
who
was
discharged
has
been
reinstated
with
full
seniority,
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
assume,
since
you
represent
the
state,
your
denying
that
they
are
entitled
to
back
pay
and
he
contends
they
are
entitled
to
back
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
to
be
sure
i
understand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
position
that
you
would
be
just
as
content
to
have
the
district
judge's
order
of
august
7,
1981
vacated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
improper
in
the
original
decree
for
the
district
judge
to
have
included
provisions
dealing
with
the
contingency
of
possible
reductions
in
force?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
he
have
power
today
to
keep
in
effect
a
portion
of
the
decree
which
would
deal
with
that
contingency
even
if
we
can't
see
it
immediately
before
us?
