mr.
john
mc
mahon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
before
proceeding
to
my
view
of
the
issue,
if
i
could
respond
to
some
of
the
questions
that
had
been
posed
with
respect
to
the
seniority
remedy.
in
effect,
upon
reinstatement,
because
the
officers
had
been
laid
off
for
fiscal
reasons,
they
did
regain
all
their
seniority
back
to
date
of
permanent
appointment.
in
that
case,
the
seniority
issue,
in
terms
of
relief
that
they
are
presently
seeking
before
the
state
agency,
dropped
out
of
the
case.
there
is
a
very
serious
back
pay
issue
that
is
involved
and
it
is
one
which
the
civil
service
commission
is
asked
to
rule
upon.
as
long
as
the
district
court's
august
7,
1981
order
does
exist,
the
civil
service
commission
cannot
rule
upon
that
order.
i
would
submit
to
you
as
a
matter
of
equities
as
to
who
should
bear
the
particular
loss,
the
city
of
boston
or
the
laid-off
officers
if,
in
fact,
the
seniority
suppression
was
not
valid,
that
should
be
an
issue
left
best
to
the
civil
service
commission
of
massachusetts.
there
are
a
variety
of
civil
service
appeals
which
have
come
up,
including
a
police
officer,
superior
officer's
appeal,
which,
i
believe,
justice
o'connor
referenced
in
her
question
and
that
order,
if
i
recall
it,
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
city
of
boston
had
used
a
political
manipulation
to
lay
off
a
small
number
of
police
officers
in
another
group
not
represented
by
the
union
before
you
today.
in
effect,
i
think
the
civil
service
commission
was
stating
that
they
found
that
there
was
a
political
discrimination
involved
in
that
order.
i
have
not
looked
at
it
and
i
apologize
if
i
have
not
quoted
it
correctly,
but
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
based
on
a
different
series
of
proofs
than
would
be
involved
in
this
case.
if
i
could
return
to
my
argument,
the
unions
submit
that
the
issue
before
you
is
whether
a
federal
court
in
an
employment
discrimination
case
can
grant
increased,
competitive
job
security
to
junior
minority
firefighters
who
were
not,
who
were
not
victims
of
past
acts
of
discrimination
by
suppressing
a
bona
fide
seniority
statute
requiring
seniority
layoffs
to
the
detriment
of
senior
non-minority
firefighters
who
were
then
terminated.
i
would
submit
that
this
judicial
override
should
be
reversed
on
statutory
grounds.
if
the
statutory
grounds
are
not
persuasive,
this
judicial
override
should
fail
for
reasons
found
in
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
may
i
note
that
under
current
law
there
are
no
constitutional
violations
that
are
present
on
the
record
before
you.
certainly
washington
v.
davis
has
now
established
that
in
order
to
have
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation
there
would
have
to
be
purposeful,
deliberate
discrimination
shown.
that
is
not
the
case
before
you.
the
plaintiffs...
i
am
sorry,
the
respondents
made
no
challenge
either
to
section
39,
the
massachusetts
seniority
statute,
or
to
layoffs
by
its
terms.
they
made
no
further
assertion
of
any
new
civil
rights
violation.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
in
framing
relief
the
district
court
cannot
disregard
the
congressional
policies
enacted
in
section
703(h)
of
title
vii,
protecting
and
conserving
earned
seniority
rights.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
statute
extends
an
immunity
to
routine
applications
of
seniority
systems
irrespective
of
disparate
impacts.
mr.
john
mc
mahon
your
honor,
there
were
two
actions.
in
the
police
case,
the
police
decision
had
been
adjudicated
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
title
vii's
application
to
municipalities
and
local
governments.
in
the
firefighter
case,
the
plaintiffs',
private
plaintiffs'
complaint
originally
asserted
only
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
sections
1981
and
1983.
that
complaint
was
filed
in
november
of
1972.
the
united
states
filed
a
complaint
repeating
those
same
grounds
and
asserting
a
title
vii
ground
in
february
of
1973.
the
focus
in
both
complaints
was
upon
examinations
conducted
no
later
than
august
1971
and
on
recruitment
techniques.
it
may
be
that
one
could
argue
that
there
was
never
a
title
vii
violation
ever
present
in
these
cases.
however,
i
have
to
note
that
the
record
would
also
show
that
in
april
of
1972
a
boston
eligibility
list
was
established
from
the
august
1971
exam
and
some
86
non-minority
firefighter
appointments
were
made
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
plaintiffs'
complaint.
thereafter,
the
state
agencies
voluntarily
ceased
using
that
list
so
that
there
may
be
a
title
vii
connection
in
that
respect,
but
the
parties
never
focused
on
it
in
litigation
and
the
theories
in
both
cases,
as
they
were
stated
by
the
district
court,
were
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
on
the
constitution,
not
title
vii.
but,
even
if
there
is
a
constitutional
basis
to
this
case,
i
would
conclude
that
the
section
1988
of
42
us
code
would
require
a
district
court
to
shape
relief
in
an
employment
case
based
on
constitutional
grounds
according
to
other
federal
law.
such
other
federal
law
should
be
section
703(h).
you
are
really
redressing,
in
the
constitutional
sense,
individually
violations
and
only
individual
rights
can
be
violated.
i
think
then
that
you
would
use
the
same
sort
of
constructive
seniority
approach
that
this
court
has
approved
in
franks
and
approved
again
in
teamsters
and
has
commented
on
several
times,
most
recently
in
ford
motor
company
and
in
zipes,
in
order
to
extend
rightful
place
relief.
so,
even
under
the
constitution
or
title
vii,
i
think
you
come
to
the
same
result,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
did
establish
four
priority
pools.
the
first
priority
pool,
the
group
a,
consisted
of
all
persons
who
took
the
august
1971
or
earlier
examination
and
failed.
the
second
pool,
with
which
we
are
concerned,
is
the
group
c.
that
consisted
of
all
non-minority
persons
who
could
not
qualify
for
admission
into
groups
a
but
who
had
passed
a
new
examination.
i
would
submit
that
those
persons
who
were
group
c
were
not
victims
of
any
discrimination,
any
act
of
discrimination,
and
that
the
conferral
of
a
random
benefit
upon
them
without
establishing
any
victim
identification
was
not
only
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
teamsters,
but,
indeed,
it
bears
upon
the
claim
that
the
disadvantaged
senior
firefighters
have
that
their
rights
were
invaded
by
the
order
in
the
sense
that
they
lost
an
equal
protection
component
that
the
possessed.
may
i
add
that
the
particular
order
benefit
only
persons
who
were
not
victims
of
racial
discrimination
or
identified
as
victims
of
racial
discrimination;
that
a
use
of
a
racial
classification
should
only
be
approved,
if
it
ever
can
be
approved,
when
it
is
used
as
a
remedy
for
a
person
who
is
a
victim
of
past
identified
discrimination.
in
this
case,
that
surely
was
not
the
use.
instead,
and
i
think
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals'
opinions
reflect
this
fact.
at
the
august
30...
i
am
sorry,
the
july
30,
1981
hearing
before
the
district
court,
and
if
i
could
paraphrase
the
district
court,
they
said
that
the
only
issue
before
the
house
is
an
issue
of
numbers,
whether
we
were
going
to
keep
a
certain
number,
whether
we
were
going
to
decrease
a
certain
number
or
whether
we
were
going
to
increase
a
certain
number.
we
heard
arguments
on
all
the
other
issues.
that
was
the
focus.
it
was
on
percentages.
again,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
states
that
the
purpose
of
the
orders
was
to
maintain
a
semblance
of
racial
balance.
i
would
submit
to
you
that
a
purpose
in
that
direction
is
constitutionally
invalid.
finally,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
again
at
the
impact
of
the
orders
in
terms
of
any
constitutional
justification
for
the
orders.
the
impact
wasn't
dispersed
among
some
amorphous
population.
it
fell
on
83
non-minority
firefighters,
96
non-minority
police
officers.
and,
if
i
can
go
outside
the
record
for
a
moment,
it
actually
fell
on
123
non-minority
firefighters,
yet
they
are
indistinguishable
in
terms
of
advantage
of
obtaining
that
employment,
in
terms
of
the
risks
in
the
kind
of
employment
in
which
they
were
involved.
they
are
indistinguishable
from
the
beneficiaries
of
those
orders
save
in
two
respects.
the
disadvantage
individuals
did
not
share
a
preferred
racial
characteristic
and
they
were
senior.
i
have
concluded.
thank
you
very
much.
