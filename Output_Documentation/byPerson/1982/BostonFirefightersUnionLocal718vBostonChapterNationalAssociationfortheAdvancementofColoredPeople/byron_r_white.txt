what
orders
are
you
talking
about,
reinstatement
and
seniority
or
what?
what
orders
are
you
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
parties
have
had
to
comply
with
the
reduction-in-force
orders.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
issue
in
the
case
was
how
were
they
going
to
discharge
people
when
they
reduced
force?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
orders
were
that
they
wouldn't
govern
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
police
and
fire
department
have
been
complying
with
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
must
continue
to
comply--
justice
byron
r.
white
--unless
the
orders
are
set
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
seniority.
seniority.
those
issues
are
not
here
in
this
case.
but,
they
are
not
moot,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
what
if
this
judgment
is
reversed,
that
that
level
of
force
order
is
invalidated?
wouldn't
the
civil
service
commission
have...
in
short,
the
layoffs
were
invalid.
wouldn't
the
civil
service
commission
have
a
pretty
tough
time
denying
back
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
legislation
ordering
reinstatement
consistent
with
the
court's
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
ask
you
again,
was
it
consistent
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
was
it
consistent
with
the
order
to
maintain
a
particular
racial
balance
in
the
forces?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
ordered
reinstatement
of
the
very
people
that
the
court
thought
should
have
been
laid
off.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
ratio?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
my
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
all
i
needed
to
know.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
rest
of
the
case
remains
alive?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
what
seniority
did
the
blacks
have
or
the
minorities
have
when
they
were
hired
pursuant
to
the
court's
order?
did
they
just
start
out
from
scratch?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
didn't...
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
jump
them
over
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
at
the
time...
so,
when
the
layoffs
started,
the
minorities
that
had
been
hired
were
certainly
junior
to
a
lot
of
other
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
junior
to
a
lot
of
people
who
were
then
discharged
pursuant
to
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
--but,
you
were
making
the
argument
on
behalf
of
those
that
didn't,
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
you
make
that
argument
on
behalf
of
all
those
who
were
hired,
but
whom
you
can't
prove
or
you
don't
allege
were
themselves
ever
discriminated
against.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
just
saying
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
were
hired
pursuant
to
the
court's
order
that
were
never
discriminated
against
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
suppose
there
would
be
much
of
a
case
here
if
you
could
show
that
all
of
these
people
were
in
that
category
of
people
who
could
have
been
given
rightful
place
seniority
when
they
were
hired.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
