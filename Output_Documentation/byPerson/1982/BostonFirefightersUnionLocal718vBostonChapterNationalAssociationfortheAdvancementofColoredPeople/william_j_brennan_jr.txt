justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hasn't
there
been
some
recent
legislation
requiring
the
reinstatement
of
all
those
firemen
and
policemen
who
were
laid
off?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
what
kind
of
case
have
we
got
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone
who
was
aggrieved
has
now
been
reinstated,
hasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone
who
has
been
aggrieved,
every
fireman
and
police
officer
has
been
reinstated,
has
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
ask
you
again
then,
what
kind
of
a
case
do
we
have
here?
do
we
have
any?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
follow
that.
if
the
officers,
whether
firemen
or
policemen,
affected
have,
by
the
latest
legislation,
been
ordered
reinstated
and
have,
in
fact,
been
reinstated,
what
do
the
authorities
have
to
comply
with?
they
are
reinstated
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
left
of
their
appeals?
their
appeals
don't
concern
reinstatement,
do
they?
they
are
trying
to
get
back
pay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
not,
what?
the
reinstatement
is
with
what
seniority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
seem
to
be
too
sure
of
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
barnico,
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
case
is
moot
because
of
these
reinstatements,
i
take
it
we
would
vacate
all
those
orders,
wouldn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
made
the
suggestion
contemplating
that
if
the
suggestion
were
favorably
received
that
is
exactly
what
would
happen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
no
more
stripping
down,
just
that
one
order?
