mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
heard
a
few
remarks
here
which
i
would
like
to
reply
to,
but
before
i
do,
i
would
like
to
urge
upon
the
court
my
original
presentation,
namely
that
the
only
violation
upon
which
the
claimant,
the
grievant
rests
his
claim
for
back
wages
is
the
violation
of
the
employment
contract,
and
the
only
party
that
violated
that
contract
was
the
employer,
not
the
union.
the
union
committed
no
violation
of
the
contract
in
any
respect.
the
only
violation
that
we
are
confronted
with
with
respect
to
the
union
is
that
it
violated
its
duty
to
the
employee
in
its
requirement
that
it
represent
him
fairly.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
oh,
i
think
an
employer
does
have
an
interest,
yes,
sir.
i
agree.
and
that
interest
should
have
been--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--yes,
sir,
and
that
employer
in
this
particular
case
and
in
every
case
makes
a
decision
to
discharge
an
employee
for
just
cause,
and
through
three
steps
of
the
grievance
machinery,
the
employer
persists
in
that
decision.
then
the
union
in
this
particular
case
agrees
with
the
employer.
he
says,
you
have
convinced
us
that
this
employee
has
violated
his
duty
to
the
employer,
and
he
is
subject
to
discharge.
now,
the
employer
and
the
union
in
that
case
have
applied
the
grievance
machinery,
have
decided
in
their
judgment,
which
turns
out
to
have
been
a
wrong
judgment,
decided
later
on
by
a
jury,
that
the
employee
was
justly
discharged.
now
the
question
is,
shall
the
union
be
held
liable
because
it
agreed
with
the
employer
that
the
employee
was
justly
discharged,
a
decision
which
they
did
not
come
to
until
a
jury
later
on
determined
that
there
was
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
i
think
that
the
union
does
have
an
interest...
the
employer
does
have
an
interest,
and
that
the
interest
of
the
employer
is
at
all
times,
especially
since
vaca,
to
make
sure
that
it
has
discharged
the
employee
if
it
is
a
discharge
only
for
just
cause.
i
do
not
think
that
the
intervening
damage
or
the
intervening
act
or
wrongdoing
of
the
union,
a
wrong
committed
against
the
employee,
not
against
the
employer,
should
in
any
way
absolve
the
employer
from
his
wrongdoing.
it
is
just
as
if
a
culprit
who
was
slashing
away
at
his
victim
states
that
but
for
the
failure
of
the
police
to
intervene
in
a
timely
manner,
his
knife
would
not
have
reached
the
throat
of
the
victim,
and
therefore
the
police
are
responsible
for
any
of
the
responsibility
beyond
the
time
when
they
should
have
been
there
and
the
culprit
is
liable
only
for
mayhem.
now,
that
principle
is
clear
in
the
law
of
torts,
and
there
is
no
reason...
and
the
law
of
trusts,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
applicable
here.
as
prosser
stated
it,
where
one
tort
feasor
by
his
act
or
conduct
has
created
a
danger
to
the
plaintiffs
and
the
other
has
merely
failed
to
discover
or
to
remedy
it,
indemnity
will
lie
in
favor
of
the
second
tort
feasor.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
do
in
this
case,
because
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
classification
of
the
union's
wrong
as
a
tort.
some
people
treat
that
as
a
tort.
some
treat
it
as
a
breach
of
trust.
some
treat
it
as
malpractice.
and
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
the
wrong
of
the
union.
now,
the
employer
has
violated
the
contract,
and
caused
damage
to
the
employee.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
no,
the
employer
breached
the
contract
and
caused
the
damage
by
that
breach,
and
it
is
the
only
party
that
broke
the
contract,
but
i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
any
distinction
in
logic
between
the
two
situations.
why
should
the
wrongdoing
of
the
union
to
the
employee
be
a
benefit
to
the
employer
and
not
to
the
employee?
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
i
do,
and
i
think
that
as
a
contract
violation,
the
damages
to
the
employee
is
that
he
has
been
out
of
a
job
from
the
date
of
his
discharge
until
the
date
of
his
reinstatement,
and
that
is
caused
by
the
breach
of
contract,
and
only
by
the
breach
of
contract.
the
only
reason
i
bring
the
tort
analogy
in
is
because
the
employer
in
this
case
is
attempting
to
relieve
himself
of
some
of
those
damages
by
resorting
to
a
tort
or
a
breach
of
duty
by
the
union
to
the
employee,
and
there
is
no
reason
for
doing
so.
now,
in
lincoln
wilson--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--that's
not...
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
be
true
or
not,
your
honor.
we
don't
know
what--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--we
don't
know
what
an
arbitrator
would
have
decided.
we
know
that
a
jury
decided
some...
a
year
later,
but
we
don't
know
what
an
arbitrator
decided,
but
the
only
obligation
of
the
union
was
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
right.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
don't
necessarily
agree
with
that.
i
agree
that
we
must
presume
that
the
union
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--no,
i
don't
assume
that
the
arbitrator
would
rule
otherwise.
i
assume
that
the
employee
was
improperly
represented
by
the
union,
and
therefore
there
should
have
been
an
arbitration
on
the
case,
yes.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
right.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
the
only
wrong
contributed
by
the
union
was
the
wrong
in
not
presenting
the
case
to
arbitration.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
and
that
is
a
damage
which
i
think
the
union
is
liable
for
under
vaca
against
sipes,
but
the
wrong
that
arose
out
of
the
breach
of
contract
is
entirely
the
responsibility
of
the
employer,
because
the
employer
alone
broke
the
contract.
i
don't
think
that
we
can
say
that
there
was
a
divided
liability
as
to
the
breach
of
contract.
what
is
really
being
said
here
is
that
the
union
should
in
some
way
indemnify
the
employer
for
the
period
of
time
when
the
union
might
have
taken
the
case
to
arbitration,
and
didn't
in
breach
of
its
duty
to
fair
representation,
but
there
is
no
agreement
in
the
contract
that
there
should
be
an
indemnification.
there
is
no
agreement
in
the
contract
that
the
union
will
take
the
case
to
arbitration.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
i
don't
say
that
it
has
no
duty,
your
honor,
but
i
say
that
the
only
duty
it
has
is
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
or
will
not
take
the
case
to
arbitration.
now,
that--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--i
think
it
does
have
a
duty
to
act
in
good
faith,
but
it
is
not
a
duty
to
the
employer.
it
is
a
duty
to
the
employee.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
say
that,
as
long
as
there
is
a
duty
of
fair
representation,
but--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--but
it
would
also
be...
create
a
liability
of
the
union
for...
damages.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
yes,
and
those
can
be
very
severe,
and
we
have,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
practice,
we
have
had
very
severe
expenses
in
representing...
in
defending
cases
of
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation.
these
cases
are
proliferating
almost
to
the
extent
of
personal
injury
actions
at
the
present
moment.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
no,
i
don't
think
so.
vaca
against
sipes
indicated
that
it
all
ought
to
be
dealt
with
as
one
ball
of
wax,
and
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
don't
think
it
should.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
not
for
back
wages.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that
and
whatever
other
expenses
are
involved
to
the
employee.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
there
are
discovery,
litigation
expenses.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
such
as
litigation
expenses,
discovery
expenses,
the
counsel
fees,
of
course,
which
are
the
major
cost,
and
in
that
respect,
i
would
like
to
make
a
remark
about
the
suggestion
of
mr.
poff
that
summit
valley
indicates
that
there
would
be
no
counsel
fees
as
damages.
well,
that
isn't
true.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
claim
of
counsel
fees
from
the
defendant,
from
the
plaintiff
against
the
defendant
in
their
lawsuit
between
each
other,
but
that
did
not
indicate
that
there
would
not
be
damages
if
the
lawsuit
for
which
counsel
fees
were
being
asked
was
a
lawsuit
against
a
third
party,
which--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
no,
i
would
say
that
if
the
union
deliberately
in
bad
faith
extended
the...
affirmatively
took
action
which
extended
the
period
of
time
during
which
the
employee
is
out
of
work,
that--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--i
think
that
its
duty
is
to
the
employee,
but
i
don't
consider
that,
your
honor,
to
be
an
exercise
of
bad
faith
to
the
employer
necessarily.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
if
it
is
only
doing
it
for
the
purpose
of
extending
the
liability
of
the
employer,
i
suppose
you
could
consider
it
that,
but
i
consider
that
to
be
a
very
rare
and
very
hypothetical
situation
which
i
can
hardly
contemplate.
i
should
think
the
employer
could
find
relief
against
that
in
some
other
way.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
it
could
go
into
court
and
say,
look,
this
union
is
not
acting
in
good
faith,
and
for
that
reason
i
want
this
proceeding
to
be
halted,
to
obtain
a
restraining
order,
at
least
to
show
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
union's
duty
to
proceed
with
the
arbitration.
there
is
a
duty
under
the
contract
to
proceed
with
the
arbitration
machinery.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
no...
well,
the
duty
here
was
the
duty
not
to
initiate
the
grievance
machinery,
which
is
no
different...
i
wouldn't
say
it
was
no
different,
but
it
is
equivalent
to
the
duty
of
the
employer
not
to
discharge
the
employee
without
just
cause.
the
employer
discharged
the
employee
without
just
cause.
the
union
decided
that
the
employee
was
discharged
for
just
cause,
and
consequently
it
did
not
take
the
case
to
arbitration.
that
is
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
too.
now,
it
turns
out
that
the
judgment
of
the
union
in
deciding
not
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration
was
wrong
in
the
view
of
the
jury.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
it
should
be
resolved,
i
say,
in
a
single
bit
of
litigation.
is
that
what
you
suggest,
your
honor?
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
would
say
that,
but
nevertheless,
the
obligations
and
the
liabilities
are
nevertheless
separate
liabilities,
and
they
are
treated
as
such,
and
the
jury
is
instructed
to
treat
them
as
separate
liabilities.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
would
say,
your
honor,
there
is
a
duty
of
the
union
to
participate
in
good
faith
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
of
the
contract.
it
is
a
procedural
type
of
obligation
to
the
employer.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
and
that
includes
to
go
to
arbitration
provided
that
the
union
believes
that
the
case
warrants
arbitration.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
think
it
does.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
whether
you
would
call
it
a
duty
or
interest,
i
don't
know,
but
it
has
a
definite
interest
in
it,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
duty
to
the
employer,
if
broken,
and
we
will
assume
a
breach,
means
that
the
union
now
has
to
pay
the
damages
for
which
the
employer
is
responsible
because
he
discharged
the
employee
without
just
cause.
i
say
that
there
are
other
damages
that
it
will
have
to
bear,
but
not
that.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
exactly.
that's
right.
i
say
that,
yes.
he
does
not
have
that
obligation.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
right.
the
only
thing
is
that
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that
you
have
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
machinery
that
is
provided
for
in
the
contract,
in
good
faith,
but
there
is
no
duty
to
take
the...
any
case,
so
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned,
to
arbitration.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--no,
sir.
i
think
that
i
can--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--that's
right.
yes.
i
think
i
can
differentiate
it,
your
honor.
i
think
that
when
a
union
considers
an
action
taken
by
the
employer
which
it
believes
to
be
a
violation
of
the
contract,
it
has
to
make
a
decision,
shall
it
take
that
case
to
arbitration
or
not,
and
it
has
to
make
that
decision
in
the
manner
provided
for
in
the
agreement.
now,
the
agreement
doesn't
say
that
the
union
must
take
it
to
arbitration.
there
is
no
agreement
that
i
know
of
that
indicates
anything
of
that
sort.
all
it
says
is
that
if
the
union
is
not
satisfied
with
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
in
the
grievance
machinery,
it
may
appeal
to
an
arbitrator.
now,
its
consideration
of
the
case,
its
investigation
of
the
case
ought
to
be
done
fairly.
whether
that
is
an
obligation
to
the
employer
or
not,
i
am
not
so
sure.
i
think
that
those
things
are
basically
obligations
to
the
employee
whom
the
union
represents.
the
only
obligation
which
i,
in
response
to
your
question,
will
admit
to
so
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned
is
that
it
use...
it
apply
the
administrative
machinery
procedurally
in
a
proper
way,
and
not
take
advantage
of
failings
by
the
employer
in
procedure
or
anything
of
that
sort.
that
is
what
i
would
mean
by
acting
in
good
faith
in
connection
with
the
grievance
procedure.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
no,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
the
jury
was
instructed,
as
i
recall
it...
i
don't
have
them
before
me...
that
it
would
first
have
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
and
then,
if
it
found
that,
then
it
would
then
determine
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
agreement,
and
of
course
the
court
used
the
usual
language
that
has
become
prevalent
in
these
duty
of
fair
representation
cases,
callous,
reckless,
discriminatory,
arbitrary.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
there
was
no...
there
was
no
instruction
as
far
as
i
can
judge
from
reading
the
record
that
the
union
was...
that
the
jury
was
asked
to
find
any
relative
fault.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
it
was
authorized
to
determine
what
damages
were
caused
by
the
employer
and
the
union,
and
the
employer,
and
in
doing
so,
it
apportioned
some
of
the
damages
for
back
pay
to
the
union
and
some
to
the
employer.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
do
not
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
do
not
recall.
i
do
not
recall
whether--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--i
should
think
so,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
brief
shows
that
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
"to
break
the
damages
down
by
determining
a
hyptothetical
date
when
an
arbitration
of
the
grievance
would
supposedly
have
been--
"
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--that's
right.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
don't
recall.
i
wasn't
there,
your
honor.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i
don't
know.
there
should
have
been,
i
agree.
there
shouldn't
have
been
liability
in
this
case.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
it
is
not
preserved.
i
wish
i
could
argue
this
case
right...
could
treat
this
case
right
from
the
beginning.
the
only
finding...
there
were
no
findings
of
fact...
findings
or
facts
or--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--no...
well,
i
am
responding
to
the
question,
but
i
do
want
to--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--the
union
and
the
employer
jointly,
your
honor.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
right.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
right.
and
we
think
that--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--no,
your
honor.
if
the
union
itself
was
responsible
in
any
way
for
the
discharge
of
the
employee,
or
if
it--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
this
case.
this
is
a
case
just
like
that.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
because
i
don't
think
that
the
action
of
the
union,
albeit
a
wrongful
act,
should
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
employer
who
committed
the
violation
of
the
contract.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
yes,
but
the
employee
under
the
principle
i
espouse
will
recover
all
his
back
wages.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
i
think
that
we
do
have
a--
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
--that
they
recover
double?
yes,
i
do,
unless
the
court
is
going
to
impose
punitive
damages,
which
this
court
has
already
decided
are
not
appropriate,
but
the
employee,
so
far
as
the
breach
of
contract
is
concerned,
is
entitled
to
be
made
whole
under
the
law
of
contract
damages,
and
he
is
made
whole
if
the
employer
pays
his
back
pay
in
full.
the
only
thing
that
results
from
assessing
the
union
with
any
part
of
the
liability
is
that
it
doesn't
help
him
at
all.
it
is
the
employer
who
then
gets
a
contribution
from
the
union
to
the
payment
of
those
damages.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
it
is
a
windfall
to
the
employer,
it's
a
windfall
to
the
employer
if
it
now
obtains
part
of
the
damages
which
it
causes
from
the
union
instead
of
paying
them
in
whole.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
i
think
that's
possible.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
but
i
think
it
is
possible.
if
in
that
case
the
employee
cannot
be
made
whole
by
an
action
against
the
employer,
then
i
think
we
would
have
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
damages
have
thus
been
changed,
and
the
damages
to
the
employee
from
the
failure
to
perform
the
duty
of
representation
has
not
in
fact
brought
that
about.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
vaca
against
sipes.
the
union
was
sued
individually
by...
alone,
and
the
court
said
that
there's
no
reason
why
it
can't
be
because
the
union
would
only
be
liable
for
the
damages
that
it
caused
by
its
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation
and
not
by
the
damages
caused
by
the
violation
of
the
contract.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
no.
and
i
think
vaca
against
sipes
said
that.
but
what
i'm
talking
about
is
what
should
the
allocation
be.
i
think
that
it's
proper
for
the
two
claims
to
be
brought
in
one
suit
rather
than
to
have
two
separate
suits.
but
the
allocation
is
the
question
that's
before
this
court,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
union...
the
allocation
should
be
to
require
the
union
to
pay
for
the
wrong
done
by
the
employer
by
its
violation
of
contract,
and
that's
all.
the
union
did
cause
some
damage
to
the
employee
by
requiring
him
to
go
to
court,
retain
counsel
and
suffer
whatever
costs
there
were
in
pursuing
his
claim;
but
those
are
the
only
damages
for
which
the
union
should
be
held
responsible.
now,
i'd
like
to
before...
i
only
have
a
minute,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
holding
the
union
back
pay
will
be
a
considerable
hardship
to
the
union.
this
court
has
considered
that
in
previous
cases.
and
that
the
result
may
well
be
that
a
union
would
prefer
and
would
find
it
more
economical
to
take
all
cases
to
arbitration
rather
than
risk
the
possibility
that
some
jury
is
going
to
second
guess
it
and
decide
that
it
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
that
is
not
what
the
grievance
machinery
is
supposed
to
accomplish.
finally,
these
cases
have
so
proliferated
already
that
insurance
companies
are
approaching
us.
i've
received
since
my
name
appeared
on
the
brief,
i've
received
several
brochures
from
insurance
companies
on
duty
of
fair
representation
which
may
be
a
message
to
me
as
to
what
the
outcome
is
going
to
be.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
what
it
amounts
to,
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
i
think
would
be
quite
regrettable.
i
think
that
the
duty
of
the
union
should
be
severely
restricted,
as
vaca
did,
and
i
think
that
the
principles
of
vaca
and
czosek
against
o'mara,
as
stated
in
those
decisions,
ought
to
be
followed;
that
there
is
no
reason
for
overruling
those
decisions
because
of
the
peculiar
posture
of
this
case.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
well,
the
best
way
and
the
way
that
in
fact
is
that
the
union
membership
isn't
going
to
stand
for
the
union
officers
not
representing
its
employees
fairly.
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
a
union
official
is
to
find
that
a
lawyer
can
accomplish
something
that
a
union
representative
couldn't
accomplish.
so
union
officials
are
very
sensitive
to
their
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
cases
that
come
before
this
court
or
the
courts
generally
are
the
odd
cases,
and
in
most
cases
are
situations
in
which
there's
been
a
hindsight
judgment
made
by
a
jury
that's
sympathetic
in
almost
all
cases
to
the
plight
of
the
employee,
and
in
order
to
give
that
employee
relief,
it
has
to
find
that
the
union
violated
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
that's
the
way
the
instruction
goes
to
the
jury,
and
that's
the
kind
of
situation
that
we're
confronted
with
in
most
of
these
cases.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
right.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
right,
and
i
don't
think
it
should
be
relieved
of
that
defense.
mr.
asher
w.
schwartz
that's
right.
i
would
rather
find
that
to
be
true.
