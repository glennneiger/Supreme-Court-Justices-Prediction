justice
byron

your
suggestion
is
that
the
union
owes
a
duty
to
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
sounds
like
it.
the
union
owes
a
duty
to
the
employer
to
utilize
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
so
that
the
employer's
liability
won't
continue.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
employer
is
at
fault.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
logical
in
your
submission,
i
take
it,
that
the
employer,
if
it
was
held
liable
for
all
the
back
wages,
would
have
a
claim
over
against
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
the
employee
not
be
able
to
have
a
judgment
against
the
employer
for
the
entire
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
the
union
and
the
employer
fight
it
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
the
union
does
owe
a
duty
to
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
duty
that
means
that
such
a
duty
that
the
union
has
to
pick
up
the
back
wages
for
a
period
of
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
duty
to
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
doesn't
join
the
union,
what
if
the
employee
just
sued
the
employer?
could
he
get
a
judgment
against
the
employer
for
the
entire
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
comes
back
and
says,
i
asked
the
union
and
the
union
breached
his
duty,
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
he
proves
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
he
could
never
get
a
judgment
against
the
employer
for
the
entire
amount.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
when
the
union
decides
not
to
go
to
arbitration,
and
let's
assume
that
that
is
an
arbitrary
decision,
and
it
is
a
breach
of
duty
to
the
employee,
do
you
think
when
the
union
acts
in
that
way,
that
at
the
very
same
time
it
is
breaching
a
duty
to
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
hasn't
got
any
duty
to
the
employer
to
take
the
case
to
arbitration.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
breach
of
duty
to
the
employee
is
not
necessarily
a
breach
of
duty
to
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
if
you
do
take
it
to
arbitration,
you
have
a
duty
to
do
so
in
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
try
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wondered
about
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
relative
fault
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
recovery,
though?
what
kind
of
a
recovery
was
it
authorized
to
make
under
the
instructions
against
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
instructions
authorize
it
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
union
is
trying
a
lawsuit
and
it
has
got
a...
and
it
is
being
charged
with
duty
of
representation,
i
would
think
it
would
watch
out
for
itself
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury
as
to
what
kind
of
damages
the
jury
is
authorized
to
find.
if
the
jury
is...
if
the
court
had
expressly
authorized
the
jury
to
divide
up
the
liability
for
back
pay,
which
apparently
it
did,
it
seems
to
me
the
union
would...
you,
certainly,
based
on
what
you
say
here,
would
be
up
on
your
hind
legs
immediately.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
is
just
absolutely
contrary
to
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
did
you
object
to
that
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
an
objection
to
the
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
interested
because
the
union
is
the
one
that
took
the
case
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
you
got
relieved
of
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
grounds
that
you
weren't
liable
for
back
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
really
the
instructions
were
wrong.
mr.
schwartz,
this
case
really
boils
down,
i
gather,
to
a
question
of
the
law
of
damages,
and
it
is
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
union
can
never
be
liable,
just
focusing
on
its
liability
to
the
employee
alone,
can
never
be
liable
for
a
loss
of
pay.
is
that
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no.
why
shouldn't
the
employee
be
able
to
sue
the
union
for
its
breach
of
duty,
not
join
the
employer
at
all
and
say
look,
if
you'd
have
done
what
you're
supposed
to,
take
this
case
to
arbitration,
i
would
have
been
reinstated.
and
i
have
now
proved
breach
of
duty,
and
i
have
proved
a
breach
of
contract,
and
part
of
my
damages
are
that
i've
been
out
of
work
for
longer
than
i
should
have
been,
and
you're
at
fault.
that's
part
of
my
damages
for
your
tort.
it's
true
the
employer's
been
breaching
his
duty
to
me
all
the
time,
but
nevertheless,
it's
part
of
my
damages,
and
i
don't
want
to
have
to...
i
can't
even
join
the
employer.
he's
gone
somewhere
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you'd...
i
supposed
you'd
rather...
i'm
not
sure
whether
you'd
rather
have
it
that
way,
or
would
you
like
the
employer's
defense
sustained,
namely
when
he's
sued,
he
says
well,
you
didn't
follow
the
contract
procedure;
your
agent
didn't
take
the
case
to
arbitration,
and
hence,
the
grievance
ended
the
whole
matter.
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
which
way
would
you
rather
have
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
normally
an
employer
when
he's
sued
can
say
i
move
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
you
didn't
follow
the
available
remedies
under
the
contract.
vaca
relieved
the
union
of
that
defense,
relieved
the
employee
of
that
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
saying
that
the
employer
cannot
rely
on
that
defense
if
the
union
has
breached
its
duty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
would
rather
have
to
face
the
charge
of
unfair
representation
than
to
have
the
defense
sustained.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
poff,
according
to
the
union,
the
union's
position
was
quite
inconsistent
with
the
instructions.
i
mean
the
union's
position
voiced
here
was
inconsistent
with
the
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
union
that
it
was
not
liable.
isn't
it...
wouldn't
it
have
been
possible
for
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
decided
there
was
error
in
entering
the
judgment
against
the
union,
which
was
certainly
consistent
with
the
instructions,
couldn't
it
have
ordered
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
a
new
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
net
effect
of
its
holding
was
that
the
instructions
were
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
those
instructions
then
were
wholly
inconsistent
with
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
union's
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there'd
have
to
be
a
new
trial
because
it
was
a
jury
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
we
would
have
the
authority--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
what
it
did,
that
it
should
have
ordered
a
new
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
suffers
a
substantial
burden
on
these
cases,
i
must
say.
even
if
it
doesn't
have
liability
for
back
pay,
there's
certainly--
justice
byron
r.
white
--certainly
some
financial
outlays
in
defending
the
case
and
in
paying
your
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
part
of
the
judgment...
part
of
the
judgment
is
that
they
must
pay
part
of
them.
