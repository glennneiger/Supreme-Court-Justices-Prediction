mr.
william
b.
poff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
urges
this
court
to
hold
that
the
american
postal
workers
union,
which
has
been
adjudicated
in
this
case
to
have
violated
its
duty
of
fair
representation
to
the
appellant,
in
fact
in
this
case
held
to
have
done
so
maliciously,
recklessly,
and
in
callous
disregard
of
his
rights,
be
held
responsible
to
bowen
for
that
portion
of
his
increased
wage
loss
which
occurred
while
he
was
seeking
the
redress
in
the
courts
which
the
union
has
been
found
to
have
been
responsible
for
seeking
for
him
through
the
process
of
arbitration.
this
case
presents
the
court
with
all
the
parties
and
with
the
necessary
evidential
underpinnning
with
which
to
refine
the
apportionment
of
damage
test
or
principles
which
this
court
has
enunciated
in
a
long
line
of
cases
beginning
with
vaca
versus
sipes,
extending
down
to
czosek
versus
o'mara,
and
to
hines
versus
anchor
motor
freight,
and
at
least
by
passing
reference
in
two
cases
last
year,
the
clayton
case
and
the
mitchell
case,
both
being
section
301
cases.
we
think
that
this
court
has
been
consistent,
although
it
has
not
met
this
issue
squarely,
in
holding
that
the
apportionment
of
responsibility
in
these
cases
between
the
employer
and
the
union
should
be
predicated
upon
relative
fault.
the
court
in
vaca
and
i
think
the
court
in
subsequent
decisions
has
indicated
that
the
union
should
not
be
responsible
for
those
damages
that
have
been
caused
by
the
employer,
nor
should
the
employer
be
held
responsible
for
those
damages
caused
by
the
union.
the
closest
decision
that
this
court
has
had
to
the
case
immediately
before
you
is
the
hines
versus
anchor
motor
freight
case.
there,
the
court
did
not
have
to
meet
this
issue
head
on,
although
it
was
clear
that
it
was
going
to
have
to
be
met
on
remand,
and
you
will
recall
that
justice
stewart
in
a
concurring
opinion
which
was
not
dissented
from
by
any
member
of
the
court,
expressed
his
belief
that
the
apportionment
of
loss
of
wages
in
that
case
should
be
made
on
the
basis
of
fault,
and
that
the
employer
who
had
achieved
a
successful
arbitration
award
in
that
case
should
not
be
held
responsible
for
any
damages
that
had
accrued
subsequent
to
the
arbitration
award
and
prior
to
the
time
that
there
would
be
a
determination
of...
an
untainted
determination
of
the
employee's
rights
and
his
determination
that
he
should
return
to
work.
mr.
william
b.
poff
i
would
assume
not,
sir,
though
i
would
not
think
it
unusual
perhaps
to
find--
mr.
william
b.
poff
--i
would
not
think
you
reticent
to
do
so
if
you
saw
fit,
but
in
this
instance,
at
least,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
comment
at
least
that
that
statement
was
made
by
justice
stewart,
and
i
have
seen
nothing
to
indicate
disagreement
with
it.
i
would
suggest
that
the
fact
that
you
do
have
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
this
kind
of
setting,
in
unfair
labor
practice
cases,
8b
cases,
assessing
back
wage
responsibility
against
unions
indicates
that
there
is
certainly
nothing
anathema
as
far
as
national
labor
policy
is
concerned
against
assessing
back
wages
in
these
kinds
of
situations
where
unions
have
failed
to
represent
employees
fairly.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
national
labor
policy
in
assessing
back
wages,
because
in
fact
section
10(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
expressly
authorizes
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
remedy
cases,
discrimination
cases
in
that
fashion.
in
order
to
adopt
the
position
that
the
apwu
asserts
in
this
case
would,
we
suggest,
emasculate
the
very
purpose
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
there
are
in
these
cases,
we
suggest,
only
about
three
elements
of
damages
that
can
ever
be
assessed
against
a
union
for
a
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
one
would
be
the
possibility
of
back
pay.
a
second
would
be
attorneys'
fees.
a
third
would
be
court
costs
and
related
items
of
damage.
if
the
union
is
successful
in
the
position
in
this
case
that
it
is
in
no
event
liable
for
back
pay
responsibility,
that
only
leaves
attorneys'
fees
and
court
costs.
attorneys'
fees,
as
was
suggested
no
later
than
last
term
with
the
summit
valley
industries
case,
a
secondary
boycott
case
in
which
this
court
refused
to
impose
attorneys'
fees
against
unions,
and
reiterated
the
american
rule,
it
is
unlikely
that
you
will
ever
have
or
that
you
will
often
have
a
situation
such
as
this,
where
you
do
have
a
bad
faith
finding
below
which
would
justify
the
imposition
of
even
attorneys'
fees
against
unions,
and
unless
this
court
is
going
to
carve
out
an
exception
or
unfair
representation
cases
in
the
attorneys'
fee
area,
another
exception
to
the
american
rule,
then
attorneys'
fees
themselves
would
not
in
cases...
in
most
cases
of
unfair
representation
be
an
element
of
damage.
that
would
leave
only
a
court
cost
type
of
figure,
which
in
the
present
case
might
be
indicative
of
what
you
could
expect
in
other
cases,
$1,463
divided
jointly,
so
a
liability
would
be
imposed
upon
the
union
which
would
be
miniscule,
which
would
in
fact
be
less
than
the
cost
that
they
would
incur
to
have
processed
the
grievance
properly
to
begin
with.
so,
we
suggest
that
to
accept
the
position
of
the
american
postal
workers
union
in
this
case
is
to
render
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
a
duty
without
any
sanctions
to
enforce
it,
because--
mr.
william
b.
poff
--you
will
recall,
sir,
that
in
vaca
and
sipes,
two
tests
are
really
stated.
there
is
the
arbitrary
and
perfunctory
standard
referred
to
on
one
occasion
and
the
arbitrary
bad
faith
and
discriminatory
language
in
another.
i
think
it
has
generally
been
accepted
that
the
appropriate
rule
is
arbitrary
bad
faith
or
discriminatory
conduct
by
unions
to
constitute
unfair
representation.
certainly,
if
there
is...
there
have
been
cases,
however,
which
have
gone
off
on
essentially
a
negligence
standard,
relying
upon
the
court's
arbitrary
and
perfunctory
language,
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
those
cases,
that
would
not
be
a
necessary
finding
of
fault
on
the
part
of
the
union
to
justify
the
imposition
of
attorneys'
fees.
and
therefore,
if
the
result
urged
in
this
case
by
the
appellee
is
successful,
then
the
duty
of
fair
representation
which
was
judicially
created
to
achieve
some
balance
and
responsibility
in
this
area
will
be
rendered
of
no
effect.
there
is
also,
of
course,
the
national
labor
policy
which
is
well
recognized
in
support
of
the
arbitral
process,
and
we
would
submit
that
the...
that
employers
in
this
context
submit
to
an
arbitration
agreement
with
the
thought
that
they
will
act
as
they
deem
appropriate
under
the
facts
of
an
individual
case,
that
the
union
will,
if
it
deems
it
necessary,
grieve,
and
that
this
matter
will
then
ultimately
be
settled
by
arbitration
within
a
relatively
and...
a
time
frame
that
can
be
relatively...
be
ascertained
and
predicted
with
some
degree
of
certainty.
if,
as
in
this
case,
the
union
can
by
failing
to
take
a
case
to
arbitration
expand
indefinitely
the
period
of
lost
wage
exposure
that
an
employer
has,
then
the
employer's
intentions
in
entering
into
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
a
grievance
and
arbitration
process
will
have
been
thwarted.
he
did
not
in
essence
bargain
for
an
indefinite
expansion
of
his
liability,
which
brings
us
specifically
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
are
unusual
in
the
many
district
court,
circuit
court
cases
that
have
developed
since
vaca
versus
sipes.
this
case
does
come
to
the
court
with
sound
underpinning
as
to
when
an
arbitration
award
would
have
been
rendered
that
would
have
returned
this
employee
to
his
employment,
and
the
trial
court
below
made
the
specific
finding
that
the
employer
should
bear
the
back
wage
responsibility,
some
$17,000,
from
the
time
of
termination
until
the
time
that
an
arbitration
award
would
have
returned
him
to
his
employment,
and
that
subsequent
to
that
time,
until
there
was
a
judicial
holding
or
until
there
was
a
jury
finding
that
he
should
be
returned
to
work,
this
period
of
time
having
occurred,
and
this
loss
of
wage
having
occurred
because
of
the
union's
reckless,
as
the
jury
found,
malicious,
callous
disregard
of
bowen's
rights
to
take
his
case
to
arbitration,
that
that
period
of
time
was
the
union's
responsibility,
and
some
$30,000
in
wages
were
assessed
against
the
apwu
on
that
basis.
we
think--
mr.
william
b.
poff
--as
to
the
postal
service,
your
honor,
it
was
an
advisory
jury.
as
to
the
union,
it
was
not.
it
sat
in
a
dual
capacity
because
of
the
governmental
character
of
the
postal
service.
and
we
think
that
the
apwu
and
unions
of
like
position
should
not
be
able
to
expand
an
employer's
liability
for
back
pay
indefinitely
by
breaching
this
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
appellee
attempts
to
structure
an
argument
in
this
case
predicated
upon
a
pure
breach
of
contract
analogy
going
back
to
the
smith
and
evening
news
cases.
mr.
william
b.
poff
i
suppose
that
at
root
we
do
not,
your
honor,
despite
our
interest
perhaps
in
the
law
in
this
area.
however,
we
are,
as
you
know,
confronted
with
a
fourth
circuit
holding
that
because
we
did
not
note
cross
appeal
from
the
verdict
below,
which
we
deem
to
be
totally
favorable,
and
did
not
see
any
need
to
cross
appeal
from,
because
of
that
and
because
of
a
footnote
that
was
added
to
this
decision
some
four
months
after
the
initial
decision
was
rendered
in
our
favor,
we
did
not
think
we
would
be
here
in
this
posture.
the
footnote
brought
us
here
because
it
took
away
the
$30,000
of
the
postal
workers
union's
damages
that
would
otherwise
have
been
paid
by
the
postal
service
by
saying
they
would
not
disturb
the
trial
court's
apportionment
of
some
$22,964.12
to
the
postal
service
because
we
had
not
noted
an
appeal
as
to
that.
so,
for
that
reason,
it
is
a
matter
of
some
considerable
concern
to
us.
mr.
william
b.
poff
it
is...
yes.
mr.
william
b.
poff
well,
sir,
i
think
that
our
point
with
regard
to
the
actions
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
belatedly
amending
its
decision
to
take
$30,000
away
from
us
is
one
that
has
been
adequately
briefed,
and
i
do
not
desire
to
discuss
that
at
any
great
length
with
the
court.
we
do,
however,
certainly
take
the
position
that
if
the
apwu
is
excused
from
paying
any
share
of
lost
wages
suffered
by
bowen,
that
he
does
remain
entitled
to
a
full
compensatory
award
from
the
postal
service.
the
smith
versus
evening
news
analysis
which
the
union
engages
in
apparently
in
an
effort
to
reach
the
result
that
no
back
wages
should
be
awarded
against
the
union
in
any
unfair
representation
case
except
one
perhaps
where
they
conspire
initially
with
the
employer,
it
seems
to
us
inapposite
because,
first
of
all,
smith
was
not
an
unfair
representation
case.
it
did
not
involve
a
case
with
a
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure,
and
as
this
court
suggested
last
term
in
united
parcel
service
versus
mitchell,
in
which
you
held...
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute
of
limitations
question
with
a
section
301
case.
you
in
language
in
that
case
point
out
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
analyze
this
kind
of
case
on
a
pure
breach
of
contract
theory,
because
once
you
get
the
tripartite
hybrid
procedure
of
employer,
employee,
and
union,
in
a
section
301
setting,
with
the
threshold
question
being
whether
there
has
been
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
by
the
union,
that
it
is
not
a
true
breach
of
contract
case
any
longer,
that
it
is
a,
i
believe,
in
the
words
of
this
court,
a
creature
of
labor
law,
and
so
we
think
that
for
these
reasons,
that
the
rationale
of
the
apwu
in
its
brief
is
fallacious
and
flawed.
i
would
like,
if
your
honors
please,
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
purposes.
mr.
william
b.
poff
yes,
your
honor.
i
understood
mr.
schwartz
to
concede
in
response
to
questions
that
if
this
employer
had
been
bankrupt
that
the
employee
would
be
entitled
to
recover
his
back
wages
from
the
union
in
this
situation.
i
think
if
that
be
the
result,
and
i
think
it
should
be
the...
it
certainly
should
be
an
admission
that
the
union
is
responsible
for
back
wages
in
this
situation
and
should
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
there
was
some
suggestion
of
hardship
that
this
case
might
impose
upon--
mr.
william
b.
poff
--well,
they
have
taken
the
position,
sir,
that
they're
not
responsible
at
all,
not
that
they're
secondarily
liable;
and
i
took
that
to
be
an
admission
that
they
were
at
least
secondarily
liable.
mr.
william
b.
poff
it
seems
to
me,
however,
that
while
it's
appealing
to
think
of
these
cases
in
terms
of
simple
contract
or
tort
terms
that
the
law
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
more
complex
than
that
and
cannot
be
considered
in
those
terms.
you
are
dealing
here
not
with
one
wrong,
as
they
would
suggest...
the
wrong
by
the
employer...
but
with
two
wrongs.
and
is
there
any
more
equitable
way
in
a
fault
system
of
justice
that
we
have
to
apportion
fault
and
liability
between
these
two
wrongdoers...
in
this
case
malicious,
reckless
wrongdoers...
than
the
trial
court
did
in
this
case.
the
jury
was,
in
response
to
justice
white's
question,
properly
or--
mr.
william
b.

--it
is,
yes,

mr.
william

mr.
william

mr.
william

is
correct,

to
your
question
to

there
were
special
interrogatories--
mr.
william

--submitted
to
the
jury
which
are
part
of
the
appendix
in
this
case.
the
jury
was
asked
to
make
the
apportionment
of
damages.
mr.
william

and
it
did
so
pursuant
to
an
instruction
of
the
court.
mr.
william
b.
poff
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
instead
of
remanding
it
for
a
reallocation
of
damages,
which
i
think
would
have
been
appropriate
perhaps
instead
of
retrial--
mr.
william

is
correct.
mr.
william

beg
your
pardon,

mr.

mr.

i
think

is
obliged
to
go
to

i
think
that
in
this
case
it
most...
it
was
held
by
the
trial
court
and
jury
to
have
been
obliged.
mr.
william
b.
poff
it
does
indeed,
sir.
whether
they
need
to
go
in
order
to
fulfill
their
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
william
b.

and
i...
in
this
case
it
was
held
that
they
did
have
that
obligation.
i
don't
think
there
is
any...
i
think
they
have--
mr.
william

not
have
to
go
to

sir?
mr.
william

oh,
no.

and
i
think,
in
fact,
that
the
place
to...
as
has
been
suggested
by
justice
rehnquist,
the
place
to
police
the
duty
of
unfair
representation,
which
is
going
to
be
a
very
fragile
duty
indeed
if
you
accept
the
union's
position
in
this
case
because
there's
no
sanction.
there's
nothing
that...
the
union
just
breaches
it
with
impunity.
but
it--
mr.
william
b.
poff
--well,
i
would
think,
sir,
that
in
this--
mr.
william
b.
poff
--they
haven't
paid
them
yet,
sir.
[laughter]
mr.
william
b.
poff
part
of
them
at
least.
i
would
suggest,
though,
that
a
proper
policing
of
the
arbitrary
bad
faith
standard
is
the
place
to
control
the
unfair
representation
cases,
not
in
the...
and
to
end
the
area
of
an
appropriate
allocation
of
damages.
because
here
we
have
a
union
that
concededly
is
responsible
for
$30,000
worth
of
mr.
bowen's
lost
wages
and
the
union
contending
that
it
has
no
responsibility
for
those.
