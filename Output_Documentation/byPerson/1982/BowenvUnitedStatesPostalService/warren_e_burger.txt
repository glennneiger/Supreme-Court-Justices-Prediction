we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
bowen
against
united
states
postal
service
et
al.--
mr.
poff,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
etkind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
leave
that,
the
allocation
was
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
shared
fault
here,
was
it
not?
that
the
union's
conduct
had
enlarged
the
total
injury.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
question
about
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
schwartz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
whole
scheme
of
things,
do
you
think
that
an
employer
has
no
interest
in
whether
a
union
carries
out
its
obligations
to
employees
who
are
members
of
that
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
whole
scheme
of
the
system
of
labor
relations,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
this
matter
of
duty,
i
think
there
is
a
certain
ambiguity
in
some
of
the
responses.
i
understood
you
to
say
in
response
to
one
question
earlier
that
you
could
not
say...
you
could
not
say
there
was
no
duty
by
the
union
to
the
employer.
is
that
your--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--but
that
includes
arbitration.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
not
mean
that
the
employer
has
a
very
real
interest
in
the
arbitration
process,
to
preserve
labor
harmony
and
peace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there
is
a
duty
of
some
kind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
are
bifurcating
this
duty,
however
you
define
it.
you
are
now
saying
that
there
is
no
duty
to
go
to
arbitration,
but
there
is
a
duty
that
if
they
go
to
arbitration,
it
must
be
conducted
in
good
faith.
how
do
you
really
separate
those
two
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
one
is
just...
it
is
a
continuous
stream,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
preserve
labor
harmony.
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
arbitration
clause,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
early
in
your
argument,
mr.
schwartz,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
proper
to
have...
i
think
you
used
the
phrase
something
like
"all
one
ball
of
wax",
that
both
these
parties
should
be
sued
in
one
suit
and
that
there
should
be
allocation.
now,
did
i
misunderstand
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
just
joining
the
doctors
and
the
lawyers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now,
mr.
schwartz.
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
poff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
stated
remedy
is
still
available,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
remedy
is
still
available
as
a
result
of
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
justice
powell
will
have
two
judgments
and
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce.
