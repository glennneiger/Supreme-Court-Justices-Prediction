ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
right
of
an
employer
to
rely
on
the
union
to
bring
any
breach
by
it
to
its
attention
within
the
context
of
the
grievance
process
so
that
the
employer
can
rectify
its
wrong
and
prevent
the
accrual
of
additional
damages
is
inherent
in
the
collective
bargaining
system.
as
this
court
frequently
has
recognized,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
contains
a
grievance
arbitration
provision
is
far
more
than
an
ordinary
contract.
the
grievance
process
itself
defines
the
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
is
the
vehicle
by
which
meaning
and
content
are
given
to
that
agreement.
indeed,
the
court
has
described
the
grievance
procedure
as
part
of
the
ongoing
collective
bargaining
process
between
the
union
and
the
employer.
accordingly,
an
act
that
may
be
an
apparent
violation
of
the
contractual
provisions
is
not
a
breach
of
them
until
it
is
determined
to
be
such
within
the
context
of
the
grievance
machinery.
if
it
is
at
that
point
liability
will
be
assessed
to
the
breaching
party
who
took
the
action
that
it
did
with
the
full
knowledge
that
its
conduct
might
subsequently
in
the
grievance
process
be
found
to
constitute
a
breach.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no.
no,
indeed.
the
employer
would
be
liable
for
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
while
the
union
is
going
to
be
liable
for
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
our
argument
is
that
at
the
point
at
which
the...
if
the
union
had
not
breached
its
duty,
and
the
employer
would
have
been
reinstated,
at
that
point
his
damages
would
cease
accruing,
so
that
if
they
continued
to
accrue--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--but
the
union
is
in
a
very
different
position
than
the
attorney.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
because
the
union
is
part...
there
is
a
tripartite
relationship
among
the
union
and
the
employer
and
the
employee,
and
the
union
itself
owes
a
duty
to
prevent
the
continuation
of
this
wrong.
it
is
because
the
union
and
the
employer
are
parties
to
the
contract.
they
are
the
only
parties
to
the
contract.
they
are
the
ones
that
define
what
the
contract
means.
so
that
if
the
union,
because
of
its
breach,
because
of
its
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
is
in
effect
saying
there
is
no
breach
of
this
agreement,
then
the
employer
is
entitled
to
rely
on
that,
and
to
go
on
from
there.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
no--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--it
is...
it
isn't--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--it
is
first
and
foremost
a
duty
to
the
employee
to
represent
him
fairly,
and
really
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
damages
can
the
employee
collect
from
the
union
for
its
breach
of
the
duty
to
represent.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
as
to
those
damages
that
accrue
subsequent
to
what
i
have
been
calling
the
hypothetical
reinstatement
date?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
because
in
our
view
once
the
decision
is
made
in
the
grievance--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--but
the
employer
really
should
not
be
subject
to
that
sort
of
fighting,
because
it
is
acting
in
accordance
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
once
either
it
has
gotten
an
arbitral
decision
in
its
favor
or
the
time
for--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--to
the
employer
in
the
sense
of
cutting
off
its
liability.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
that's
right.
i
might
have
misunderstood
you.
i
don't
mean
a
duty
arising
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
much
as
a
duty--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--that's
what
it
is
going
to
have
to
do,
we
believe.
as
justice
stewart
stated
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
hines--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--oh,
exactly.
yes,
that's
completely
true.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
i'm
sorry?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
no
question
about
that
at
all.
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
hines,
justice--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
but
the
employer
remains
liable?
no,
the
employer
does
not
remain
liable.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
right.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
your
question,
justice.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
the
employer.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
well,
no,
because
he
would
have
to...
the
union...
the
employer
would
have
a
defense
based
on
his
failure
to
exhaust
his
remedies
against
the
union.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
he
would
have
to
prove
that
the
union
breached
his
duty.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
in
that
case,
the
employer
should...
the
employee
should
be
able
to
collect
from
the
employer
up
until
the
point
when
he
would
have
been
reinstated.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
no,
he
could
not
get
a...
unless,
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
the
employer
cooperated
in
the
union's
ongoing
breach,
but
that
certainly
is
not
the
case
here.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
that's
right.
the
original
fault--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--in
the
language
of
torts,
it
would
be
a
superseding
cause,
i
believe.
that's
right.
and
that
is
because...
and
that
is
because
it
doesn't
arise
out
of
tort.
it
arises
out
of
the
national
labor
policy,
which
is
that
rights
are
only
defined
within
the
grievance
procedure.
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself
may
be
violated,
but
the
breach
itself
isn't
determined
until
it
is
within...
within
the
grievance
process.
in
hines,
justice
stewart
stated
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
once
a
grievance
process
is
exhausted,
the
employer's
failure
to
reinstate
discharged
employees
cannot
be
anything
but
rightful
until
there
is
a
contrary
determination.
there
is
no
difference
in
result
whether,
as
in
hines,
an
abrital
award
is
rendered
in
favor
of
the
employer,
or
until
the
time
for
processing
the
grievance
has
expired.
so
the
point
is
that
there
is
no
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
unless
such
a
breach
is
found
in
the
context
of
the
grievance
process.
in
other
words,
the
unique
feature
of
the
grievance
arbitration
process,
the
fact
that
it
is
the
vehicle
for
the
determination
of
the
substantive
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
distinguishes
an
action
on
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
containing
such
a
provision
from
suit
on
an
ordinary
contract.
in
the
latter
case,
damages
continue
to
accrue
up
to
the
time
of
trial,
because
it
is
only
at
trial
that
the
rights
of
the
parties
are
determined.
by
contrast,
where
a
grievance
procedure
is
available
to
the
parties,
their
rights
can
be
determined
substantially
earlier,
so
that
all
parties
can
conform
their
conduct
to
that
determination.
accordingly,
where
because
of
the
union's
wrongs
the
employer's
breach
is
not
brought
to
its
attention
in
the
context
of
the
grievance
procedure,
it
is
only
fair
that
the
union
bear
those
additional
damages
that
flow
from
the
malfunctioning
of
the
grievance
machinery
which
it
caused.
therefore,
in
hines
versus
anchor
motor
freight,
justice
stewart
explained
that
the
union,
not
the
employer,
would
be
liable
for
back
wages
accruing
subsequent
to
an
arbitral
award
that
was
erroneously
rendered
in
favor
of
the
employer
because
of
the
union's
breach
of
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
there
is
no
reason
for
a
different
result
here.
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
justice
stewart
was
alone.
the
union
argues
that
imposing
liability
on
it
for
lost
wages
will
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
to
settle
employee
grievances
short
of
arbitration.
in
the
first
place,
a
rule
that
imposes
liability
on
an
employer
for
these
damages
may
chill
its
right
to
discharge
employees
whom
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
entitle
it
to
dismiss,
thus
modifying
the
parties'
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
any
event,
the
union's
contention
that
the
apportionment
rule
we
urge
would
force
it
to
arbitrate
even
frivolous
grievances
for
fear
that
if
it
did
not,
it
might
be
assessed
back
wages,
is
unfounded.
in
vaca,
the
court
made
clear
that
a
union
can
breach
its
duty
of
fair
representation
only
by
conduct
that
is
arbitrary,
discriminatory,
or
in
bad
faith.
for
example,
here
the
jury
found
that
the
union
had
acted
maliciously,
recklessly,
or
in
callous
disregard
of
petitioner's
rights.
in
our
view,
that
sort
of
conduct
should
be
chilled,
and
moreover,
whatever--
ms.
barbara
e.
etkind
--well,
that
is
true,
but
of
course
this
court
is
faced
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
with
the
jury
and
the
district
court's
findings
that
here
the
union
acted
callously
and
maliciously.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
