mr.
poff,
you
referred
to
justice
stewart's
concurring
opinion
and
commented
that
no
one
dissented
from
it.
do
you
ordinarily
think
you
find
dissents
from
concurring
opinions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
ask
you
to
predict
the
vagaries
of
the
court,
sir.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
poff,
don't
you
think
that
if
there
is
any
requirement
of
egregiousness
in
order
to
find
that
a
union
has
breached
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
that
many
of
those
will
be
accompanied
by
a
finding
of
malice
or
bad
faith?
i
mean,
negligence,
i
would
think,
wouldn't
be
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
of
liability
against
the
union.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
etkind,
do
i
gather
from
your
statement
that
the
government
views
the
kind
of
liability
that
an
employer
and
a
union
would
incur
in
this
situation
as
more
or
less
a
kind
of
joint
liability
for
pretty
much
the
same
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
that
be?
supposing
that
i
am
employed
by
the
united
states,
and
i
think
the
united
states
has
fired
me
wrongly,
and
i
hire
a
lawyer,
and
the
lawyer
eventually
tries
to
get
me
reinstated
but
doesn't
succeed,
and
then
i
go
to
another
lawyer,
and
that
lawyer
succeeds
in
getting
me
reinstated
three
or
four
years
later.
now,
certainly
the
employer
is
liable
all
during
that
period.
now,
i
may
have
a
claim
against
the
first
lawyer,
but
it
is
only
for
malpractice.
he
isn't
obligated
to
pay
me
part
of
my
wages.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
certainly
not
the
prototypical
case
that
the
union
is
going
to
face
if
your
view
prevails,
that
a
guy
coming
back
from
las
vegas
and
turning
down
12
arbitrations
in
one
day,
i
mean,
that
is
a...
i
would
have
liked
to
argue
that
case
to
the
jury
myself,
i
think.
you
are
going
to
get
some
much
grayer
shadings,
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
counsel,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
employer's
breach
is
a
contractual
one,
do
you
think
a
tort
doctrine
is
necessarily
applicable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
prosser's
example
dealt
with
two
tortfeasors
and
the
allocation
of
liability
between
them.
certainly
the
employer
here
is
not
a
tort
feasor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
traditionally,
your
rules
of
damages
under
contract
law,
i
think,
are
quite
different
than
under
tort
law.
for
instance,
in
contract
law,
you
have
got
the
doctors,
like
hadley
against
vacksendale,
that
restrict
rather
significantly
the
kind
of
damages
you
can
ordinarily
recover
in
a
tort
action
under
your
doctrine
of
proximate
cause.
i
think
you
have
to
analyze
it
as
one
being
a
contract
violator
or
breacher,
and
the
other
being
a
tort
feasor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
point
isn't
preserved
here.
we
didn't
grant
the
jury
to
hear
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
counsel,
why
don't
you
limit
yourself
to
the
issues
that
are
presented
here
unless
you
are
responding
to
questions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
if
the
employer
before
trial
has
gone
bankrupt,
and
so
that
it
is
insolvent
and
can't
respond
to
a
judgment
of
damages.
could
the
court
impose
at
least
secondary
liability
on
the
union
for
the
loss
of
that
employer's
payment?
--for
the
loss
of
back
pay
that
the
employer
can't
pay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
could
restrict
the
contours
of
the
union's
liability
substantially,
have
a
much
higher
standard
that
the
jury
had
to
find,
or
a
worse
conduct
and
still
have
a
different
result
than
you
suggest
on
the
allocation
of
damages.
i
mean
the
union's
problems
could
be
cured
in
more
than
one
way.
