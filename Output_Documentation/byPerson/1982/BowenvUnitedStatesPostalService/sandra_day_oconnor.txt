well,
let's
suppose
the
fact
finder
determined
that
the
employer
initially
made
a
wrongful
discharge,
but
that
if
the
union
had
exercised
its
right
to
compel
arbitration,
that
the
employee
would
have
gone
back
to
work
on
date
x,
and
that
as
a
result,
the
employee
has
been
damaged
thereafter
to
the
extent
of
his
loss
of
wages,
and
you
are
saying
under
those
circumstances
the
union
may
not
be
held
liable
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
damages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
is.
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
why
applying
normal
damages
principles
you
can
take
that
view,
assuming
the
fact-finder
makes
the
appropriate
determination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
are
only
talking
now
about
an
employee.
it
is
the
employee
who
is
the
plaintiff.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
under
the
present
posture
of
the
case.
is
there
anything
wrong
in
the
trial
court
seeing
to
it
that
in
the
overall
scheme
of
things,
where
the
employee
is
suing
both
the
employer
and
the
union,
and
where
both
are
liable
for
damages,
that
the
employee
doesn't
make
a
double
recovery,
and
that
there
is
an
apportionment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that
under
the
law
of
damages?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
it
just
windfall
to
the
union
to
be
let
off--
