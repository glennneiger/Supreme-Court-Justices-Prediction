justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
schwartz,
do
you
agree
with
the
suggestion
from
the
bench
that
the
proper
procedure
here
would
have
been
for
the
employer
after
this
litigation
to
institute
a
suit
against
the
union
itself
in
separate
litigation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
it
is
dealt
with
in
one
ball
of
wax,
how
are
you
going
to
give
the
employer
an
opportunity
to
recover,
ever
recover
from
the
union?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
don't
think
it
ever
should?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
would
relegate
it
exclusively
to
possibly
attorney's
fees
and
costs?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
such
as?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
such
as
what?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
union--
--mr.
schwartz,
would
you
please
stay
near
the
microphones?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
schwartz,
if
the
union
deliberately,
as
somebody
has
suggested,
in
bad
faith
prolonged
the
arbitration
proceedings,
say,
for
five
years,
are
you
suggesting
the
responsibility
would
be
on
the
employer
to
pay
the
back
wages
for
the
entire
period
with
no
responsibility
on
the
union?
that
is
your
position?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
i
thought
you
said,
responding
to
justice
stevens,
that
there
was
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
union
to
exercise
good
faith
with
respect
to
the
employer.
did
you
say
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
if
he
extended
it
for
five
years?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
for
example?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
that
duty
breached
in
this
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
court
found,
and
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
it,
that
both
the
union
and
employer
acted
maliciously
and
arbitrarily,
so
that
you
have
the
malice
or...
founds
the
fact
in
this
case
with
respect
to
both
parties.
and
why
shouldn't
the
liabilities
of
the
parties
be
resolved
in
a
single
litigation?
it
is
in
every
other
context
with
which
i
am
familiar.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
first
of
these
is
81-525,
bowen
against
the
united
states
postal
service.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
petitioner,
charles
bowen
an
employee
of
the
postal
service
was
discharged
for
alleged
misconduct.
bowen
filed
a
grievance
with
his
union.
after
considerable
delay
it
declined
to
take
the
grievance
to
arbitration.
bowen
then
brought
suit
in
the
federal
district
court.
he
claimed
that
the
postal
service
had
discharged
him
unlawfully
and
that
the
union
had
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
court
found
that
both
the
service
and
the
union
had
acted
in
reckless
and
callous
disregard
of
bowen's
rights.
the
district
court
apportioned
the
amount
of
bowen's
damages
primarily
his
lost
backpay
between
them.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
district
court's
findings
of
breaches
by
both
parties
but
nevertheless
overturned
the
damages
award
against
the
union.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
rejecting
apportionment
of
damages.
we
hold
that
when
both
the
employer
and
the
union
have
breached
their
obligations
under
the
bargaining
agreement,
the
damage
it
sustained
should
be
apportioned
between
the
two
wrongdoers.
in
this
case,
where
the
union's
default
resulted
in
a
substantial
increase
in
the
damages
suffered
by
bowen,
we
agree
that
the
union
is
primarily
responsible
for
that
increase.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
our
holding
reaffirms
the
governing
principle
announced
in
vaca
against
sipes.
damages
attributed
solely
to
the
employer's
breach
of
contract
should
not
be
charged
to
the
union,
but
increases
in
those
damages
resulting
solely
from
the
union's
wrongdoing
should
not
be
charged
to
the
employer.
justice
white
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
in
the
judgment
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
marshall
and
blackmun
joined.
and
in
all
but
part
iv
of
which
justice
rehnquist
joined.
justice
rehnquist
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
