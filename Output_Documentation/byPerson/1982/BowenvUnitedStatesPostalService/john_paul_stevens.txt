isn't
it
true
that
if
the
union
had
not
breached
its
duty,
those
damages
would
not
have
accrued?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
that
the
way
the
case
comes
to
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
wait
a
minute.
wait
a
minute.
doesn't
the
jury
determination
mean
that
as
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case,
we
must
assume
that
the
employer
breached
his
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
should
we
not
presume
that
an
arbitrator
would
have
reached
the
same
conclusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
the
employer
breached
his
contract,
and
we
assume
the
arbitration
process
works,
the
arbitrator
surely
would
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
assume
the
other,
then
maybe
nobody
should
be
liable
after
the
date
of
the
arbitration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there
had
been,
and
if
there
had
been
no
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
the
damages
would
have
been
cut
off
as
of
the
date
of
the
arbitration.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
both
wrongs
contributed
to
the
damages
post
that
date.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
white
asked
earlier
if
the
union
has
any
duty
to
the
employer
to
be
diligent
and
faithful
in
its
obligation
of
fair
representation
of
the
employee.
do
you
say
it
has
no
duty
to
the
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
have
a
duty
to
act
in
good
faith,
and
does
that
duty
run
to
the
employer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
not
the
employer
have
an
interest
in
having
that
duty
performed
properly?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
say
there
is
no
obligation
at
all
to
the
employer,
that
then
in
subsequent
litigation
the
union
would
always
come
in
and
say,
well,
we
acted
in
bad
faith,
we
were
careless,
we
were
negligent,
but
we
can't
be
liable,
we
don't
owe
you
any
responsibility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
always
help
the
employee,
if
it
took
that
position
in
litigation,
because
then
it
would
pave
the
way
for
a
bigger
recovery
against
the
employer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
fees.
that
would
be
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
that
be
dispositive
of
the
case?
it
seems
to
be
consistent
with
the
position
that
they
are
liable
for
the
damages
that
can
only
be
remedied
by
their
own...
for
what
they
caused,
but
they
can't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i
suppose
they're
not
responsible
at
all
if
recovery
can
be
had
from
the
employer.
they
are
not
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
the
employer's
wrong
to
the
extent
that
the
employer
can
be
compelled
to
pay
damages.
that's...
i
understand
their
position.
