this
was
an
advisory
jury,
wasn't
it?
justice
harry
a.

mr.
poff,
do
you
really
care
about
the
employer's
expended
liability
so
long
as
your
client
gets
paid
off?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
your
alternative
argument.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
may
be
your
stronger
one.
i
don't
know.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
employer
remains
liable.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
say,
but
the
employer
remains
liable
to
the
employee.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
your
theory,
no.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
am
just
following
up
on
justice
white's
inquiry.
but
if
you...
i
take
it
if
the
employee
just
sues
the
employer.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
the
original
fault
was
that
of
the
employer.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
really
speaking
of
an
intervening
cause.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many
joined
justice
stewart
in
his
observations?
