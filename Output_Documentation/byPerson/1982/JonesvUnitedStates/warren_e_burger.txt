chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
jones
against
the
united
states.
mr.
wasserstrom,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
hasn't
this
court,
as
well
as
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
said
there's
no
rational
connection
between
the
possible
sentence
and
the
possible
length
of
stay
after
an
acquittal,
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
the
court
has
said
expressly
that
there's
no
connection,
in
one
case
some
time
ago.
well,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
your
major
point,
perhaps,
or
a
main
point
the
matter
of
where
the
burden
of
proof
lies
at
the
time
of
that
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
that
was
a
civil
case,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
suggest
why
no
evidence
was
offered
on
his
behalf?
was
that
a
tactical
move
to
sharpen
the
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you're
also
asking...
are
you
not
also
asking
that
the
government
must
maintain
the
burden
of
proof
at
all
times?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
you'd
like
to
have
us
import
the
civil
standard
into
the
criminal
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
schwartz.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
wasserstrom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
addressing
the
weight
of
the
evidence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
real
issue
that
we've
taken
this
case
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
jones
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
powell.
