who
presented
it?
justice
byron

white
so
the
government
assumed
at
least
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
no
contrary
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
testimony
of
the
psychiatrist--
justice
byron
r.
white
--psychologist
was
uncontradicted?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
believed
him
and
thought
he
was
right,
the
burden
would
have
been
satisfied.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
by
the
testimony
of
a
psychologist?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we're
free
to
operate
under
that
rule
here
and
say,
whatever
the
rule
is,
it
was
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
think,
unless
you
also
think,
which
i
suppose
you
do,
that
there
should
have
been
a
jury
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
should
have
happened
at
the
hearing
is
that
the
government
shouldn't
have
put
on
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
the
rationale
you
propose
inevitably
would
at
least
be
relevant
to
the
claim,
on
the
very
moment
that
he
is
acquitted
that
he
may
not
be
committed
without
having
a
hearing
in
which
the
government
takes
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
agree
with
you,
the
next
challenge
will
surely
be
the
next
day
after
the
acquittal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
agreeing
with
you
has
a
lot
to
do
with
deciding
about
those
other
rationales.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
after
all,
the
acquittal
was
based
on
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
the
crime
the
person
was
insane.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
at
the
time
that
he
was
tried
or
at
the
time
he's
acquitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
the
case
shouldn't
be
here
at
all,
i
suppose.
