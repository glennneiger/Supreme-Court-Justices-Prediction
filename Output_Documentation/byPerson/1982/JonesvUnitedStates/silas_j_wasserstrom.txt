mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
september
1975
the
petitioner
was
arrested
when
he
tried
to
steal
a
coat
from
a
department
store.
six
months
later
he
was
brought
to
trial
on
a
charge
of
attempted
petty
larceny.
had
the
petitioner
pled
guilty
to
that
offense
or
been
convicted
of
it
after
trial,
he
could
have
received
a
maximum
sentence
of
one
year
in
jail.
he
would
have
been
released,
at
the
very
latest,
in
september
of
1976.
he
would
now
long
since
have
been
a
free
man.
but
petitioner
did
not
plead
guilty
and
was
not
convicted.
instead,
he
raised
an
insanity
defense,
claiming
that
because
he
was
mentally
ill
at
the
time
he
tried
to
steal
the
coat
he
should
not
be
blamed
for
his
act.
the
government
did
not
contest
this
claim
and
the
trial
court
found,
after
a
stipulated
trial,
that
the
petitioner
was
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
on
the
basis
of
this
acquittal
and
on
this
basis
alone,
the
petitioner
was
ordered
committed
indefinitely
to
a
mental
hospital.
that
is,
he
was
ordered
confined
until
he
could
prove
that
he
was
not
mentally
ill
and
dangerous.
the
petitioner
still
remains
confined
in
the
hospital
on
the
basis
of
that
commitment,
even
though
more
than
seven
years
have
now
passed
six
his
initial
incarceration
and
more
than
six
years
have
passed
since
the
time
he
would
have
necessarily
been
released
had
he
been
convicted
rather
than
acquitted.
conceivably,
he
will
remain
committed
in
the
hospital
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
petitioner
contends
that
whatever
the
validity
of
his
initial
commitment
to
the
hospital,
once
he
has
been
confined
there
for
longer
than
he
could
have
been
incarcerated
upon
conviction,
his
commitment
became
an
indefinite
one.
thus,
the
government
was
constitutionally
required
to
prove
the
need
for
his
commitment
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
something
which
the
government
has
yet
to
do
with
respect
to
mr.
jones.
if
it
cannot
do
so
now,
petitioner
submits,
he
is
entitled
to
release.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
our
position
is,
your
honor,
that
he
has
to
be
released
at
that
time
unless
the
government
can
at
that
time
prove
his
commitability
by
the
standards
required.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
it's
our
position
that
question
is
not
raised
in
this
case.
there
are
arguable
justifications
for
that
initial
commitment,
and
we
don't
discuss
one
way
or
another
whether
those
justifications
are
sufficient
to
validate
that
initial
commitment
and
we
don't
think
the
court
need
reach
that
question.
whatever
reasons
there
are
that
might
have
justified
his
initial
commitment,
those
reasons
would
have
justified
only
a
commitment
that
could
have
lasted,
without
the
government
meeting
a
burden
of
proof,
for
as
long
as
he
could
have
been
incarcerated
upon
conviction.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
we
think
the
only
justifications
that
could,
the
only
justifications
that
could
countenance
that
initial
commitment
are
punitive
in
nature,
that
is,
are
a
kind
of
punitive
rationale.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it's
terribly
important
whether
the
word
"punitive"
is
used,
but
i
do
think
that
any
kinds
of
justifications
which
would
justify
the
initial
commitment
are
what
i
would
call
backward
looking
justifications,
that
is,
justifications
that
do
turn
on
the
fact
that
he
was
found
to
have
committed
a
criminal
act
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
whether
they're
treated
as
purely
punitive
or
not
doesn't
seem
to
me
is
important,
or
the
label
that
we
attach
to
them
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
is
important.
the
point
is,
though,
those
rationales
all
do
turn
on
the
nature
of
his
act,
and
his
act
is
one
which,
we
submit,
justifies
confinement
only
for
a
year.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
i
believe
that
the
law
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
in
brown
against
the
united
states
and
in
wade
v.
jacobs,
in
both
of
those
cases
the
court
suggested
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
sentence
that
might
have
been
imposed
and
the
length
that
the
commitment
can
persist
without
the
government
proving
commitability
under
civil
commitment
standards.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
addressed
that
question,
and
i
think
this
is
the
first
case
that
raises
it.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
it
is
true
in
lynch
v.
overholser
this
court
suggested
certain
rationales
for
a
commitment,
but
it
didn't
then
go
on
to
say
whether
those
rationales
were
ones
which
would
justify
an
indefinite
commitment
or
simply
one
that
would
persist
as
long
as
the
sentence
might
have
been
imposed.
and
it's
our
view
that
those
rationales,
whether
you
call
them
punitive
or
not,
are
all
ones
which
evaporate
once
the
insanity
acquittee
has
been
confined
for
as
long
as
he
could
have
been
confined
if
he
had
been
convicted.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
of
course,
the
more
serious
the
crime,
the
longer
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
have
been
imposed
and
the
more
distant
the
rights
that
we're
talking
about,
the
more
distant
in
time
the
rights
we're
talking
about
would
become
available.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
of
course,
there
never
is
an
actual
sentence.
you
mean
the
actual
sentence
that
likely
would
have
been
imposed?
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
all
we're
arguing
for
here
is
that
at
the
time,
once
he's
been
incarcerated
as
long
as
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
have
been
imposed
is
up--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--that
is
what
the
statute
says,
your
honor.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
it's
clear
that
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
we're
not
arguing
that
he
should
automatically
get
out
after
one
year.
all
we're
arguing
is
that
after
one
year
the
state
should
have
to
prove
the
need
for
his
continued
confinement.
we're
asking
this
court
to
in
effect
read
into
the
statute
or
strike
down
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
authorizes--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--he
pled
insanity.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
it
would
be
our
position--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--well,
it
would
be
our
position
that
by
raising
the
insanity
defense
he
shouldn't
be
held
to
have
agreed
to
anything.
the
insanity
defense
is
a
defense
which
is
available
to
him
under
the
district
of
columbia
law.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
the
law...
that's
correct.
but
it's
our
view
that
the
statute,
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
provide
this
protection--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--we
say
that
he
must
have
a
hearing
after
he's
been
confined
for
as
long
as
he
could
have
been
upon
conviction,
not
because
the
statute
suggests
that,
but
because
we
think
the
constitution
requires
it.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that's
right,
he
should
have
had
one
then,
and
he
asked
for
one
then.
he
went,
as
soon
as
he
had
been
incarcerated...
confined,
rather,
for
a
year,
he
asked
for
a
hearing.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that's
when
he
should
have
had
it.
however,
the
relief
we're
asking
for
now
is
simply
that
he
be
given
one
at
this
point,
or
released.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that's
right,
and
for
that
we
rely
on
this
court's
decision
in
addington
against
texas.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
addington
was
a
civil
commitment.
however,
it
seems
to
petitioner
that
there
is
no
way
to
distinguish
addington
from
this
case
once
the
insanity
acquittee
has
been
incarcerated...
confined,
rather...
for
a
year.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
mr.
addington
had
been
committed
seven
times
in
the
eight
years
preceding
his
commitment.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
it's
part
of
the
facts
in
addington.
he
had
been
committed,
and
it's
mentioned
by
this
court
in
its
statement
of
the
facts,
he
had
been
committed
seven
times.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no.
but
i
think
that,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
addington
had
in
fact
been
committed
all
these
other
times,
that
this
court
did
not
consider
that
to
be
relevant
to
its
determination.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rationale
of
addington
is
primarily
based
on
the
liberty
at
stake
there
and
this
court's
determination
that
where
there
was
the
kind
of
massive
curtailment
of
liberty
that's
involved
in
an
indefinite
commitment
to
a
mental
hospital,
one
that
can
last
for
a
person's
life,
that
the
risk
of
error
with
respect
to
that
determination
should
be
borne
disproportionately
by
the
state.
it's
true
that
the
court
mentions
the
fact
that
there
is
the
additional
stigma
attached.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
think
the
liberty
interest
far
overshadows
the
stigma
interest.
but
let
me
say
this--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--it
doesn't
say
it
in
so
many
words,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
opinion.
let
me
say
also,
though,
that
it
seems
to
me
there
is
an
added
stigma
when
a
defendant
who
prevails
on
an
insanity
defense
is
than
ordered
committed
to
a
hospital.
the
hospitalization
itself
may
involve
a
stigma,
and
as
this
court
said
in
vitek
against
jones,
the
hospitalization
itself
also
may
involve
such
things
as
behavior
modification
and
forced
treatment
in
a
way
that
even
a
prison
may
not
involve.
and
so
the
actual
hospitalization,
whether
you
call
it
a
stigma
or
not,
is
certainly
an
oppressive
sort
of
condition.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
the
question
is
whether
he
invites
it
beyond
what
the
constitution
permits.
we'd
agree
that
he
is
making
a
claim
that
he
should
be
held
not
guilty
for
an
act
some
time
in
the
past
because
at
that
time
in
the
past,
at
the
time
he
committed
this
single
act,
he
was
mentally
ill
and
not
responsible
for
his
acts.
that's
all
that
he's
claiming.
he's
not
also
asking
that
he
should
be
committed
to
a
hospital
because
he's
now
mentally
ill
and
dangerous.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
to
begin
with,
there's
no
question
that
society
can
take
that
into
account
in
a
civil
commitment
proceeding.
obviously,
they
could
introduce
in
the
civil
commitment
proceeding
the
evidence
of
his
criminal
activities.
they
could
introduce
into
evidence
the
fact
that
he
had
himself
claimed
that
he
was
mentally
ill
at
some
time
in
the
past.
under
ordinary
evidence
rules
those
kinds
of
things
would
be
admissible.
the
question
is
whether
they
could
take
it
into
account
in
such
a
way
as
to,
simply
because
he
raises
an
insanity
defense,
put
him
in
a
hospital
in
a
situation
where
he
may
stay
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
unless
he
can
prove
that
he's
no
longer
mentally
ill
or
dangerous.
and
simply
because
the
statute
provides
that
is
not
a
reason
to
hold
that
the
statute
is
constitutional.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
there
may
be
some
confusion
about
the
50-day
hearing.
it's
true
that
the
statute
does
provide
a
hearing
for
people
who
are
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
and
it's
an
automatic
hearing
and
it
is
held
50
days
after
the
return
of
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
but
that
hearing
is
a
hearing
at
which
the
government
bears
no
burden
whatsoever.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that
was
because,
we
submit,
the
statute
says
that
unless
he
proves
that
it
shouldn't
be
continued,
it
is
continued.
that's
all
the
50-day
hearing
provides.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no,
he
never
had...
well,
he
didn't
really
have
a
second
hearing.
once
he
had
been
confined
for
over
a
year,
a
legal
challenge
was
raised
to
his
continued
confinement.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
his
attorney
did,
in
his
behalf.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
and
there
was
no
evidence
held
at
that...
no
evidence
was
taken
at
that
time.
it
was
purely
a
legal
question
of
whether,
since
he
had
been
confined
for
over
a
year,
the
government
should
be
forced
to
prove
the
need
for
his
continued
confinement
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
and
the
trial
court
ruled
against
him.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
then
reversed
itself,
and
then
reversed
itself
again.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that's
right,
your
honor.
let
me
say
one
other
thing--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--at
the
50-day
hearing
there
was
evidence
taken
from
a
psychologist,
although
the
statute
requires
that
it
be
a
psychiatrist.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
the
government
put
on
the
only
witness
that
was
put
on
at
that
hearing.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
although
the
statute
didn't
require
it
to
do
so,
it
appears
that
the
government
did
assume
that
burden.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no,
the
defense
counsel
put
on
no
evidence.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
it
was
a
psychologist.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
it
was
uncontradicted.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
clearly
a
burden
of
proof
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
would
not
have
been
satisfied.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
just
because
the
judge...
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
judge
felt
it
was
satisfied.
the
judge
was
not
operating
under
that
burden
of
proof.
the
judge
didn't
think
that
the
government
had
to
prove
anything
at
all,
much
less
had
to
prove
it
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
constitution--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--as
a
matter
of
equal
protection,
although
not
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
we
do
think
that
there
should
have
been
a
jury
trial.
we're
not
arguing
that
due
process
required
one.
your
honor,
the
judge
who
made
the
finding
at
the
50-day
hearing
that
the
petitioner
was
mentally
ill
and
dangerous
was
operating
under
a
statute
which
told
him
he
should
make
that
finding
in
any
case
where
the
petitioner
didn't
prove
that
he
was
entitled
to
be
released.
and
there's
just
no
way,
it
seems
to
me,
to
read
into
his
finding
anything
affirmative
at
all.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that's
right,
they
shouldn't
have.
let
me
suggest
something
else,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
some
extent
that
hearing
may
have
progressed
the
way
it
did
because
the
prevailing
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
that
time
appeared
clearly
to
be
that
the
petitioner
was
going
to
be
entitled
to
his
release
after
a
year
if
the
government
couldn't
meet
civil
commitment
standards.
brown
against
united
states
and
waite
v.
jacobs,
two
cases
from
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals,
had
said
that
once
the
insanity
acquittee
is
committed,
is
confined
for
as
long
as
he
could
have
been
upon
conviction,
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
government
to
prove
the
need
for
his
commitment.
that
was
the
law
in
the
district
of
columbia,
to
the
extent
there
was
any
law,
at
the
time
of
this
hearing.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
the
50-day
hearing,
the
50-day
hearing,
which
came
eight
months
after
the
defendant
was
arrested.
so
you
see,
at
that
time
the
worst
it
appeared
that
mr.
jones'
situation
would
be
was
that
within
three
or
four
months
he
would
be
entitled
to
that
hearing
where
the
government
had
the
burden
of
proof
anyway.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
to
read
into
what
actually
happened
at
that
hearing
what
the
government
would
have
this
court
read
into
it
is
grossly
unfair
to
mr.
jones
and
to
mr.
jones'
lawyer.
that
lawyer
thought
that
no
matter
what
happened
at
that
hearing
after
a
year
his
client
would
be
entitled
to
a
full
civil
commitment
proceeding.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
that
time
it
was
a
civil
commitment
proceeding
at
which
the
burden
of
proof
would
have
been
on
the
government
to
prove
commitability
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that's
right.
the
court
of
appeals
panel
first
ruled
against
the
petitioner
and
then
reversed
itself.
when
it
reversed
itself,
interestingly
enough,
the
government
did
not
proceed
with
civil
commitment
proceedings.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
the
court
of
appeals
each
time
they
decided
the
case
took
a
year,
year
and
a
half,
and
it
decided
it
three
different
times.
but
the
petitioner's,
not
his
trial
counsel,
not
his
counsel
at
the
50-day
hearing,
but
a
counsel
from
the
public
defender's
office,
brought
a
petition
for
his
release
right
after
he
had
served,
been
confined
in
the
hospital,
for
one
year.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
no,
i
think
that's
very
unlikely.
the
lawyer
that
represented
him...
frankly,
i
don't
know
the
lawyer
that
represented
him
at
the
50-day
hearing.
he's
not
a
lawyer
from
the
public
defender
service.
whether
he
didn't
present
evidence
simply
because
he
thought
he
had
none
to
offer
or
whether
he
just
didn't
take
the
trouble
that
maybe
he
should
have
taken
in
trying
to
accumulate
evidence,
or
again,
perhaps
he
simply
was
relying
on
the
fact
that
after
a
year
under
the
prevailing
law
as
it
appeared
to
be
at
that
time
his
client
was
going
to
be
entitled
to
relief
anyway.
and
this
hearing
occurred
eight
months
after
his
incarceration,
eight
months
after
his
arrest
and
he
had
been
confined
from
that
day
forth.
so
the
lawyer
may
simply
have
felt
that
at
this
hearing
it
doesn't
really
matter
much
what
happens;
three
months
from
now
the
government's
going
to
have
to
prove
this
person
is
commitable
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
that,
your
honor,
raises
what
i
think
is
a
very
interesting
point,
which
is
not
in
any
of
the
briefs.
i
was
looking
at
the--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--no,
there
isn't.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
no.
and
interestingly
enough,
when
i
was
looking
at
the
statutes
involved
here,
it
turns
out--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--i
thought
you
meant
in
d.c.
there
may
be
in
other
places.
but
in
the
statute,
where
people
are
civilly
committed
in
the
district
of
columbia
there
is
provision
made
for
the
appointment
of
a
psychiatrist
to
help
him
at
a
release
hearing,
and
he's
paid
if
the
committee
is
indigent.
there
are
no
comparable
provisions
with
respect
to
insanity
acquittees.
so
the
insanity
acquittee
is
not
supplied
with
a
psychiatrist
if
he
can't
afford
to
hire
one,
and
it's
not
even
clear
he's
entitled
to
one
should
he
be
able
to
afford
it.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
as
we
said
in
our
reply
brief,
i
think
we
concede
that
if
our
due
process
argument
fails,
that
is
if
this
court
thinks
that
the
petitioner
here
is
sufficiently
different
from
the
committee
in
addington
that
these
procedures
that
are
accorded
to
him
or
that
are
not
accorded
to
him
meet
due
process
standards,
then
it's
likely
that
the
court
would
uphold
the
difference,
would
on
the
same
theory
uphold
an
equal
protection
claim,
but
not
necessarily.
the
fact
is
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
civil
committees
are
afforded
protections
that
go
beyond
those
which
are
constitutionally
required,
and
we
still
would
argue--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--he
would
have
a
due
process
claim
once
the
ten
years
were
up.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
this
is
because...
this
is
because
the
legislature
in
texas
would
have
said
that
this
kind
of
conduct
merits
a
possible
sentence
of
up
to
ten
years,
and
because
the
rationales
for
committing
people
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
of
that
conduct
are,
if
there's
a
justification
for
commitment
at
all,
ones
that
look
to
the
nature
of
the
conduct.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
think
the
two
in
a
case
like
this
are
almost
coterminous.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
then...
again,
we're
not
conceding
that
a
commitment
based
purely
on
a
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
is
ever
justifiable.
but
this
court,
i
submit,
needn't
reach
the
question
in
this
case.
this
was
not
an
offense
that
carried
anywhere
near
life.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
it's
the
government,
not
us,
that
take
the
position
that
this
commitment
after
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
is
just
like
a
civil
commitment.
its
sole
purpose,
according
to
the
government
in
its
brief,
is
to
commit
people
who
are
mentally
ill
and
dangerous.
we
concede
that
there
may
be
other
purposes
for
an
automatic
commitment
following
a
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
then
this
court
will
have
to
decide
whether
those
other
rationales
which
we
are
not
challenging
will
justify
a
commitment,
automatic
commitment
following
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
i
don't
think
they
do,
your
honor.
the
point
is,
on
whatever
rationale
the
commitment
is
justified,
it's
not
one
that
can
justify
a
confinement
that
lasts
longer
than
the
maximum
sentence.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that's
true.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
and
that's
why
if
the
only
rationale
for
the
commitment
is
a
conclusion
that
he's
presently
mentally
ill
and
dangerous,
it
seems
to
me
it
can't
survive.
but
this
court
in
lynch
v.
overholser,
for
example,
did
mention
other
possible
rationales,
and
it's
clear
that
congress
when
they
enacted
this
statute
had
other
rationales,
that
is
for
the
purpose
of
deterring
false
insanity
pleas
and
trying
to
close
what
congress
perceived
as
a
revolving
door.
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
open
that
revolving
door.
all
we're
asking
is
that
it
not
be
wedged
shut
permanently
with
respect
to
people
such
as
mr.
jones
who
are
found
not
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
all
we're
arguing
here
is
that
it
must
meet
the
addington
standard
of
proof
once
the
petitioner
has
been
confined
for
as
long
as
he
could
have
been
confined
if
he
had
been
convicted.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
again,
your
honor,
it's
because
the
rationales
which
support
his
initial
commitment
are
ones
which
simply
do
not
justify
a
commitment
of
an
indefinite
duration.
they're
ones
which
would
justify,
arguably,
a
commitment
to
the
maximum
term
that
he
could
have
been
subjected
to.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
i
would
see
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
i
don't
think
the
50-day
hearing
as
provided
here
for
is
any
kind
of
due
process
whatsoever.
we
suggest
at
the
end
of
our
brief
that
the
government
has
several
alternatives.
after
a
person
is
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
they
could
right
then
and
there
initiate
civil
commitment
proceedings,
and
if
they
can
show
in
a
way
that
satisfies
those
standards
that
he
is
commitable
he
then
can
be
indefinitely
committed.
or
they
can
wait
until
his
maximum
sentence
is
up,
at
which
time
then
they
have
to
meet
a
standard
of
proof.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
again,
your
honor,
this
court
would
have
to
first
answer
the
question
whether
those
other
rationales
for
an
automatic
commitment
are
justifiable
ones.
we're
not
contending
that
they're
not.
they're
not
raised
by
this
case,
but
those
rationales,
to
the
extent
that
they
exist,
are
ones
which
are
geared
to
the
offense
which
the
person
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
of.
and
therefore,
once
he's
been
confined
for
as
long
as
he
could
have
been
upon
conviction,
he's
entitled
to
release
unless
the
government
can
then
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
is
committable.
i'd
like
to
reserve
who
ever
limited
time
i
have
left.
thank
you.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
make
two
points,
if
i
might.
first,
with
respect
to
the
hearing
that
was
held
after
50
days,
we
would
submit
that,
although
the
government
did
call
the
only
witness
who
testified,
that
witness
in
fact
presented
no
evidence
whatsoever
as
to
the
petitioner's
dangerousness.
her
only
testimony
was
that
he
at
one
point
refused
to
carry
out
a
project
involving
lacquering
some
copper-work
and
gave
some
anxiety
to
his
supervisor.
that
was
the
extent
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to
his
dangerousness.
she
also
said
something
to
the
effect
that,
well,
i
don't
know
what
crime
he
committed
before,
but
whatever
it
was
he
might
very
well
commit
it
again.
she
obviously
did
not
give
any
meaningful
testimony
with
respect
to
dangerousness.
we
don't
know
what
the
judge's
finding--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--well,
our
contention
is
that
it
was
required
to
be
proved
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
in
santosky
against
kramer
this
court
made
clear
that
that
means
qualitatively
meaningful
evidence,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question,
i
don't
think
the
government
would
argue
that
the
testimony
here
would
meet
a
test
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
but
i
submit
there
was
really
no
evidence
whatsoever
on
the
issue
of
dangerousness.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
well,
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
i
hope
the
court
will
decide
that
at
that
hearing
the
burden
was
on
the
petitioner
there,
and
that
and
our
challenges
as
to
the
statute
as
written
in
that
respect,
and
i
hope
the
court
won't
decide
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
somehow
what
happened
in
this
case
makes
it
different.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
we
would
still
have
an
equal
protection
argument,
your
honor.
if
this
court
was
to
rule
that
due
process
did
require
that
evidence
be
shown
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
because
of
addington
and
such
cases
as
that,
then
the
court
would
have
to
address
our
equal
protection
claim,
which
is
that
he
was
not
accorded
all
the
procedural
protections,
such
as
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
which
civil
committees
are
accorded.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
one
final
point.
the
congressional
concerns
which
mr.
schwartz
so
eloquently
described
when
he
began
his
presentation
we
would
submit
are
fully
vindicated
by
the
rule
which
we're
asking
this
court
to
adopt.
that
is,
a
rule
which
says
that
the
petitioner
can
be
confined
under
a
procedure
where
he
bears
the
burden
of
proof,
but
only
so
long
as
he
could
be
confined
had
he
been
convicted.
those
concerns
about
revolving
doors
and
so
on
are
simply
fully
vindicated
under
the
rule
we
ask
this
court
to
adopt.
whatever
burdens
this
court
may
feel
the
defendant
was
saddling
himself
with
when
he
raised
an
insanity
defense,
surely
he
did
not
expect
that
as
a
result
of
raising
that
insanity
defense
he
would
be
treated
worse
than
he
would
have
been
treated
had
he
pled
guilty
or
been
convicted.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
your
honor,
those--
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
--we
would
submit
that
there
are
meaningful
differences
in
the
release
procedures.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
but
we're
not
challenging
them,
because
they
weren't
really
raised
in
the
petitioner's
case.
he
has
not
run
into...
he
has
not
been
hurt
by
those
different
procedures.
that's
why
they're
not
raised
here.
mr.
silas
j.
wasserstrom
that's
right.
now,
it
is
true
that
when
the
government
talks
about
addington
it
mentions
the
fact
that
one
reason
the
court
decided
addington
as
it
did
and
did
not
impose
a
higher
burden
of
proof,
that
is
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
was
because
of
the
safety
valves
that
are
built
into
the
system
after
commitment.
and
so
to
the
extent,
i
think,
that
the
government
itself
relies
on
that
sort
of
thinking,
the
different
release
provisions
that
apply
for
insanity
acquittees
should
perhaps
go
into
this
court's
decision.
but
they
aren't
strictly
speaking
raised
by
this
case,
because
the
petitioner
here
has
not
been
hurt
by
those
differences.
the
major
difference
is
that
where
there's
a
civil
commitment
the
hospital
can
release
the
petitioner
outright
or
give
him
a
conditional
release
without
going
back
to
court,
whereas
with
insanity
acquittees
the
court
has
to
approve
even
conditional
releases.
