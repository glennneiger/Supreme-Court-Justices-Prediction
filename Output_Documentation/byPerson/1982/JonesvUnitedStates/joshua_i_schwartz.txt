mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
to
the
court
for
review
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
a
key
portion
of
the
coordinated
scheme
enacted
by
the
united
states
congress
to
govern
in
the
district
of
columbia
two
critical
problems:
one
is
the
question
of
whether
persons
who
claim
that
because
of
reason
of
mental
illness
they
should
be
excused
from
criminal
responsibility
should
in
fact
be
so
excused.
the
second
is
the
question
whether
it
is
sufficient
that
persons
who
successfully
raise
that
criminal
defense
may
be
treated
like
other
persons
who
are
candidates
for
civil
commitment.
the
question,
in
other
words,
is
whether
it
was
proper
for
congress
to
recognize,
as
it
did,
that
special
procedures
are
warranted
for
the
treatment
of
criminal
acquittees
to
protect
society's
public
interests
in
preventing
the
injuries
that
may
be
caused
by
those
individuals
who
have
been
excused
from
criminal
responsibility
by
reason
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
a
crime.
these
are
issues
that
every
jurisdiction
confronts.
they're
fundamental
to
our
criminal
justice
system.
we
do
not
submit
that
every
jurisdiction
must
answer
them
the
same
way,
and
in
fact,
as
the
briefs
indicate,
there
is
considerable
flux
in
this
area.
we
do
deem
it
very
significant
that
the
majority
of
the
states
have
chosen
to
enact
special
procedures
for
the
handling
of
criminal
acquittees.
but
even
if
that
were
not
so,
in
confronting
this
case
we
think
the
court
should
not
lose
sight
of
the
fundamental
fact
that
congress
or
any
state
legislature
entering
into
this
sphere
must
confront
two
conflicting
imperatives.
one
is
to
convict
only
those
persons
who
may
justly
be
held
criminally
responsible.
at
the
same
time,
a
state
legislature
or
congress
must
provide
adequate
safeguards
to
society.
the
two
procedures
rest,
one
on
the
other.
it's
not
tolerable
to
have
an
insanity
defense
unless
some
mechanism
for
providing
a
tolerable
degree
of
safety
to
society
is
available
to
ensure
another
means
of
protecting
society
from
those
persons
who
do
remain
dangerously
mentally
ill.
the
scheme
that
the
court
is
confronted
with
today
is
actually
the
product
of
several
revisions.
on
two
occasions,
in
1955
and
then
again
in
1970,
congress
reacted
to
decisions
in
two
cases
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
and
in
one
case
a
decision
of
this
court.
and
congress
has
attempted,
made
what
we
think
is
a
constitutionally
acceptable
effort
to
fine-tuning
this
statute
to
meet
various
constitutional
and
statutory
concerns.
the
first
amendment
that's
of
relevance
here
by
way
of
background
occurred
in
1955.
congress
responded
to
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
in
durham
against
the
united
states.
in
durham,
the
d.c.
circuit
acted
to
expand
the
insanity
defense,
adopting
the
rule
that
every
individual
who
can
show...
every
individual
whose
crime
is
the
product
of
mental
illness
or
mental
disease
or
defect
at
the
time
of
the
crime
is
to
be
excused
from
that
responsibility.
congress
was
concerned
that
the
effect
of
the
durham
decision,
abandoning
the
m'naughten
rule
which
had
theretofore
prevailed,
was
to
make
the
insanity
defense
much
more
widely
available.
congress
was
concerned
that
some
mechanism
should
be
provided
to
assure
that
insanity
acquittees
did
not
simply
fall
through
the
cracks
and
that
they
be
appropriately
considered
for
civil
commitment.
the
next
thing
that's
of
relevance
here
is
this
court's
1962
decision
in
lynch
against
overholser.
in
that
case
the
court
was
confronted
with
a
constitutional
challenge
quite
similar
to
the
one
presented
today.
it
was
argued
that
the
1955
version
of
the
statute
at
issue
here,
which
simply
provided
for
an
automatic
indefinite
commitment,
was
unconstitutional
because
it
did
not
provide
for
any
follow-up
hearing
to
determine
the
present
mental
illness
or
dangerousness
of
the
acquittee.
it
was
especially
contended
that
that
procedure
was
unconstitutional
because
under
davis
against
the
united
states
this
court
had
prescribed
the
rule
for
the
federal
courts
that
an
insanity
defense
might
be
sustained
simply
because
the
government
had
failed
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
was
sane
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
the
court
ultimately
found
it
unnecessary,
however,
to
answer
the
constitutional
questions
presented.
the
court
concluded
that
the
statute
as
then
written
did
not
apply
to
persons
such
as
lynch,
who
had
not
affirmatively
availed
themselves
of
the
insanity
defense.
the
court
in
that
case
had
imposed
the
insanity
defense
upon
him.
nevertheless,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
noted
that
whatever
problems
of
rationality
might
infect
such
a
statutory
scheme,
which
is,
as
i
say,
significantly
different
from
the
present
one,
might
well
not
exist
when
the
statute
is
applied
to
persons
such
as
the
present
petitioner,
who
have
affirmatively
availed
themselves
of
the
insanity
defense.
the
issues
which
this
court
was
not
required
to
answer
in
lynch
against
overholser
were
answered
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
bolton
against
harris.
there
the
court
answered
the
constitutional
questions
by
engrafting
onto
the
statute
the
requirement
that
a
second
hearing
be
held
similar
to
the
50-day
hearing
now
required
by
statute,
at
which
time
the
issues
for
the
court
would
be
the
present
mental
illness
and
dangerousness
of
the
acquitted
defendant.
and
the
d.c.
circuit
required
that
that
hearing
conform
generally
to
the
requirements
of
civil
commitments.
in
1970,
congress
enacted
the
reform
statute
for
the
district
of
columbia
courts,
and
among
the
problems
it
addressed
were
those
it
perceived
arising
from
the
decisions
in
lynch
and
bolton
against
harris.
the
court
codified
this
court's...
excuse
me.
the
congress
codified
this
court's
decision
in
lynch,
making
it
clear
that
this
procedure
which
we
are
discussing
today
does
not
have
any
application
to
an
individual
who
does
not
wish
to
raise
the
insanity
defense
but
who
is
nonetheless
adjudicated
to
be
insane.
congress
also
undertook
to
repair
the
constitutional
defect
recognized
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
bolton
against
harris.
congress,
however,
had
options
open
to
it
which
it
as
a
legislature
had
available,
which
were
not
available
to
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
problems
that
the
d.c.
circuit
had
recognized
were
the
absence
of
affirmative
proof
at
the
criminal
trial
of
actual
insanity.
in
addition,
the
d.c.
circuit
had
commented
upon
the
gap,
the
possibility
that
the
mental
status
of
the
acquittee
had
changed
in
the
interval
between
the
time
of
the
crime
and
the
time
of
the
commitment.
congress
undertook
to
repair
both
of
these
problems,
as
i
say.
congress
in
bolton
increased
the
probative
value
of
the
adjudication
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
by
requiring
that
that
defense
could
not
be
made
out
unless
the
court
concluded
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
shown
by
the
defendant,
that
the
defendant
was
in
fact
mentally
ill
and
legally
insane
and
that
that
insanity
was,
under
the
substantive
legal
standard
prevailing,
sufficient
to
excuse
the
crime.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that's
right.
congress,
however,
took
a
different
approach
than
the
d.c.
circuit--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--no,
it
clearly
was
not,
your
honor.
davis,
as
the
court
subsequently
made
clear
in
leland
against
oregon
and
reaffirmed
in
patterson
against
new
york,
davis
was
a
rule
prescribed
by
this
court
through
its
supervisory
power.
it
was
not
a
constitutional
rule,
and
it
appears
therefore
to
have
been
open
to
congress
to
prescribe
a
different
rule
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
it
changed
the
result
of
davis
for
the
district
of
columbia.
i
took
a
different
inference
from
the
term
"overruling",
obviously,
than
was
intended.
it
did
change
the
rule
of
davis
for
the
district
of
columbia,
thereby
creating
a
predicate
which
had
not
therefore
existed
in
to
be
considered
in
prescribing
the
appropriate
procedures
for
the
subsequent
commitment
procedure.
congress,
rather
than
placing
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
government
at
the
follow-up
hearing,
however,
which
was
required,
congress
did
place
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
defendant,
the
acquitted
defendant.
however,
it
compensated
for
this,
in
its
view,
by
requiring
that
the
proof
at
the
criminal
trial
be
affirmative
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
the
particular
thing
of
importance
to
this
court's
decision
that
we
believe
emerges
from
the
legislative
history
is
that
congress
deemed
it
particularly
unacceptable
that
there
be
a
disparity
in
the
burdens
of
proof
between
the
procedures
used
at
the
criminal
trial
and
the
procedures
used
in
the
commitment
phase.
as
this
court's
decision
in
addington
and
its
more
recent
decision
last
term
in
santosky
against
kramer
stress,
the
purpose
of
a
burden
of
proof
is
to
reflect
a
societal
judgment
as
to
the
fair
allocation
of
the
risk
of
error.
congress
believed
that
it
was
unfair
that
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
factfinding
decision
be
allocated
in
a
manner
in
the
commitment
proceeding
that
was
not
coordinated
with
the
allocation
of
the
risk
of
error
at
the
insanity
trial.
so
congress
adopted
comparable
burdens,
in
each
case
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
were
that
not
so,
were
that
not
done,
congress
recognized
that
the
so-called
revolving
door
phenomenon
would
exist.
that
is,
individuals
could
be
adjudicated
to
be
not
criminally
responsible
by
reason
of
insanity
and
merely
because
of
the
disparity
in
the
burdens
of
proof,
not
because
of
a
change
in
mental
status,
that
individual
might
escape
commitment.
congress
thought
it
unacceptable
for
there
to
be
that
disparity.
section
301(d)
therefore
provides
today
for
a
temporary
automatic
commitment.
following
that
temporary
commitment,
which
is
not
to
exceed
50
days,
a
hearing
is
held.
in
that
interim
period,
although
the
statute
does
not
say
so
in
so
many
words,
the
decisions
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
and
the
d.c.
circuit
both
interpret
the
statute
to
require
that
the
hospital
to
which
the
individual
is
temporarily
committed
undertake
a
psychiatric
or
psychological
evaluation.
by
the
way,
so
far
as
we're
aware
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
which
specifies
in
any
way
what
type
of
professional
is
to
undertake
that
evaluation,
and
certainly
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no.
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
government
disagrees
with
the
petitioner's
contention
that
his
present
confinement
rests
upon
that
temporary
commitment
or
upon
his
acquittal.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the
government's
contention
is
that
the
reason
that
mr.
jones
is
today
committed
are
twofold:
one,
a
hearing
was
held
at
the
conclusion
of
50
days.
at
that
hearing
the
only
proof
that
was
presented
was
the
government's
proof,
by
dr.
gertrude
cooper,
a
psychologist
from
st.
elizabeth's
hospital.
she
testified
that
mr.
jones
remained
mentally
ill,
that
he
remained
dangerous
to
himself
and
to
others.
she
testified
that
he
suffered
from
auditory
hallucinations,
that
he
heard
voices
that
other
people
did
not
hear,
that
his
thinking
was
infected
with
delusional
ideas,
and
that,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
was
receiving
900
milligrams
of
thorazine
daily,
a
very
high
dose
according
to
all
the
testimony,
he
nonetheless
continued
to
have
these
hallucinations.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the
statute
on
its
face
does
prescribe
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
acquittee.
that
burden
of
proof
obviously
must
be
subdivided
into
its
two
components,
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion
and
the
burden
of
going
forward.
in
this
case
it
is
perfectly
clear,
we
submit,
that
the
government
bore
the
burden
of
going
forward.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that's
right.
in
fact,
it's
fair
to
say
that
transcript
reveals
a
certain
amount
of
confusion.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
he
also
said
that
this
is
a
bolton
hearing,
and
bolton
of
course
teaches
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government.
but
let's
let...
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion
and
the
burden
of
going
forward
one
at
a
time.
certainly
the
burden
of
going
forward
was
in
fact
borne
by
the
government.
mr.
kraekoff,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
on
the
page
you're
referring
to,
as
i
recall,
said
that
he
thought
the
burden
was
upon
the
defendant,
but
nevertheless
the
government
was
prepared
to
proceed,
and
he
asked
whether
that
would
suit
the
pleasure
of
the
court
and
of
the
petitioner's
counsel.
in
fact,
petitioner's
counsel
had
no
witnesses
and
all
agreed
that
the
government
should
put
on
its
evidence,
and
it
did
so.
furthermore,
that
evidence
was
uncontradicted
and
was
not
challenged
in
any
way
by
the
cross-examination.
indeed,
we
suggest
that
it's
possible
to
read
the
transcript
as
embodying
a
concession
by
petitioner's
counsel
that
the
facts
were
as
the
government's
witness
claimed
they
were.
in
any
event,
what
is
critical,
we
think,
to
the
court's
decision
is
that
this
case
does
not
present
any
issue
about
whether
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
may
be
placed
upon
the
acquittee,
because
it
was
not
in
this
case.
and
furthermore,
we
are
advised
by
st.
elizabeth's
hospital
and
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
it
simply
has
not
ever
occurred
so
far
as
we
know
that
an
individual's
commitment
has
been
continued
simply
because
of
a
lack
of
proof.
that
is,
the
government
always
undertakes
to
present
or
to
sponsor
the
testimony
of
the
doctors
from
st.
elizabeth's
hospital
who
have
examined
the
individual.
there
are
times
when
the
government
does
not
particularly
agree
with
that
testimony.
the
decision
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
united
states
versus
ecker
refers
to
the
peculiar
situation
and
the
fact
that
this
hearing
is
not
always
strictly
adversary
because
the
government,
as
counsel
for
st.
elizabeth's
hospital,
does
not
in
fact
in
its
capacity
as
prosecutor
agree
with
that
testimony.
but
the
testimony
is
nevertheless
provided.
the
hospital
provides
a
report.
it
is
open
to
the
government
to
find
other
witnesses
if
it
wishes
if
it
doesn't
agree
with
that
report.
but
evidence
is
provided
to
support
the
commitment,
and
clearly
the
record
reveals
that
happened
in
this
case
and
it's
our
understanding
that
that
is
the
norm.
the
other
issue
is
the
burden,
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion.
we
would
submit
that
the
relevant
datum
in
this
case
is
the
ultimate
conclusion
of
the
superior
court
in
this
case.
the
court
entered
its
findings,
and
i'd
like
to
read
them
if
i
may,
that
petitioner
"is
mentally
ill
and
as
a
result
of
his
mental
illness
at
this
time
he
constitutes
a
danger
to
himself
or
others.
"
we'd
suggest
that,
particularly
in
light
of
the
absence
of
any
contrary
argument
by
petitioner's
counsel,
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
court
concluded
that,
wherever
the
law
might
place
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion,
the
government
had
successfully
shouldered
it.
and
therefore
we--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--your
honor,
that
may
be
correct.
i
suppose
it's
fair
to
point
out
that
we
had
not
read
this
transcript
at
the
time
we
filed
our
brief
in
opposition
and
these
facts
were
not
called
to
the
court's
attention.
in
fact,
it
was
my
brother
mr.
wasserstrom
who
took
the
initiative
of
submitting
this
transcript
to
the
court
with
a
copy
to
us.
it
may
well
be
that
this
case
does
not
present
all
of
the
questions
or
some
in
the
focus
that
the
court
believed
that
they
were
in
when
it
granted
the
petition.
that's
obviously
not
for
us
to
say.
in
any
event,
it
is
our
contention
that,
although
these
issues
are
not
presented
as
we
see
it
on
this
record,
it
is
of
course
our
contention
that
the
statute
assigning
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion,
as
well
as
adopting
a
burden
of
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
as
the
standard
of
proof,
is
in
any
event
constitutional.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
justice
o'connor,
the
answer
is
clear
that
that
is
not
possible.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the
statute
doesn't...
neither
the
statute
for
commitment
nor
the
statute
on
insanity
defenses...
and
they
are
all
part
of
section
301,
enacted
at
one
time...
does
not
recognize
any
difference.
in
fact,
in
law
there
is
no
defense
of
temporary
insanity.
the
issue
is,
of
course,
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
whether
it's
the
product
of
the
time.
so
of
course
there
is
a
possibility
that
an
acquittal
reflects
temporary
insanity.
of
course,
the
jury's
verdict...
the
jury
makes,
or
in
this
case
the
judge
because
the
right
of
jury
trial
was
waived,
makes
no
finding
on
that
subject.
it
is
not
the
government's
contention
that
the
finding
of
insanity
which
produced
the
crime
is
sufficient
in
itself
to
support
a
commitment.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no,
he
wasn't
incompetent
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
yes,
there
is.
the
standard
for
competency--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--if
you're
incompetent--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--you
cannot
be
committed
under
this
scheme.
the
courts--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--only
if
you
are
independently
found
to
be
mentally
ill
and
dangerous.
the
relevant
decision
is
the
court's
decision
in
jackson
against
indiana.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
but
that
he
nevertheless
had
become
competent
by
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
he
was
committed
because
the
standard
for...
first
of
all,
the
standard
for
competency
in
law
is--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--yes,
after--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--no.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
50
days
elapsed.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
no.
at
the
time
he
was
committed
there
was
a
hearing,
the
hearing
at--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
hearing
was--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--no.
we're
talking
about
two
hearings.
the
defendant
received
a
criminal
trial.
in
this
case
he
was
tried
upon
a
set
of
stipulated
facts.
he
was
committed
for
50
days
to
st.
elizabeth's
hospital.
he
was
evaluated
by
the
doctors
there.
he
was
returned
to
court.
a
second
hearing
was
held.
at
that
hearing
the
government--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--on
the...
i'm
afraid
i--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i
understand
now.
i'm
sorry
for
being
obtuse.
there
was
no
hearing
at
that
time.
petitioner
concedes
that
it
was
nevertheless
lawful
to
commit
him
for
that
50-day
period.
there
is
no
issue
before
the
court
as
to
whether
that
was
lawful.
the
issue
is
whether
the
hearing
that
was
held
50
days
later
is
sufficient
to
continue
his
commitment
in
the
nature
of
a
civil
commitment.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
labels
in
this
area
can
be
confusing
and
they're
rather
arbitrary.
but
the
important
fact
is
that
the
government's
contention
is...
the
government's
contention
is
that
this
commitment
may
be
sustained
as
a
civil
commitment.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
there's
no
need
to
reach
the
issue
that
mr.
wasserstrom
says
that
potentially
exists,
if
the
court
accepts
our
argument
that
addington
is
distinguishable
and
that
this
class
of
individuals
may
be
civilly
committed,
with
the
full
consequences
of
a
civil
commitment,
with
the
procedures
that
are
afforded
under
this
statute.
there
is
no
reason
to
decide
whether
congress
could
in
any
event
adopt
a
verdict
of
guilty
but
mentally
ill
and
sentence
someone
and
empower
a
judge
to
sentence
someone
to
st.
elizabeth's
hospital.
there
is
really
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
that
was
not
congress'
intention.
the
only
question
presented...
the
only
way
the
court
could
reach
that
result
in
our
view
is
if
the
court
rejects
our
arguments
distinguishing
addington.
and
it's
to
those
arguments
that
i'd
like
to
turn
more
directly
now.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
we
are
arguing
that
in
this
case
that
was
a
commitment
hearing
and
that
the
government
did
bear
the
risk
of
nonpersuasion
as
well.
however,
we
would
argue,
should
the
court
view
the
facts
in
a
different
manner,
that
that
nevertheless
was
a
commitment
hearing
and
not
a
release
hearing,
because
the
statute
prescribes
that
the
hearing
must
be
held,
that
the
court
must
make
findings,
determine
the
issues
and
making
findings
and
conclusions
which
are
reviewable
upon
appeal,
and
that
in
effect...
and
that
the
only
way
commitment
can
be
continued
without
a
determination
of
the
issue
of
present
mental
illness
and
dangerousness
is
if
the
defendant
waives
that
hearing.
so
it's
not
possible
for
the
commitment
to
just
go
on
of
its
own
force
unless
the
defendant
exercises
his
right
to
waive
it.
so
that
we
contend
that,
even
if
it
were
not
true,
if
in
another
case
or
if
in
this
case
this
was
not...
the
government
didn't
bear
the
burden
of
proof,
it
still
is
a
commitment
hearing,
which
simply
cannot
be
ignored
as
petitioner
would
have
the
court
do,
as
though
it
had
never
happened.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
we
may
be
saying
other
things,
but
we
are
among
other
things
saying
that,
certainly.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
the
release
procedures
which
mr.
jones
now
confronts
are
the
same
in
material
respect
to
those
that
confront
a
civil
committee.
that
is,
the
standard
prescribed
by
the
statute,
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
of
releasability,
is
the
same
as
that
prescribed
for
civil
committees,
and
the
criteria
for
release
are
the
same.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
would
agree
that
they're
crucial.
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
petitioner
had
not
raised
them
and
therefore
it
declined
to
comment
on
them.
the
judicial
avenues
for
release
are
exactly
comparable,
are
comparable.
there
are
other
avenues
for
release
which
may
or
may
not
be
identical.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
that
is
true.
but
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
jones...
in
fact,
the
hospital
in
mr.
jones'
case,
so
far
as
that
aspect
of
the
statute
is
relevant,
the
hospital
on
one
occasion
recommended
his
conditional
release.
the
court
approved
his
conditional
release.
so
he
has
no
claim
that
he
has
been
injured
by
the
requirement
of
judicial
review.
that
conditional
release,
as
is
mentioned
in
our
brief,
did
not
work
out
and
the
hospital
recommended
that
it
be
terminated.
there's
really
no
occasion
to--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--i'm
afraid,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
the
answer
is
not
really
simple.
the
statute
does
not--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--under
the
statute
as
written,
the
right
to
judicial
hearings
has
the
same...
in
both
cases
has
a
periodic
element.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
they're
six-month
periods
at
which
the
criminal
committee
may
seek
his
release.
on
the
other,
on
the
civil
side,
there
is
no
statutory
procedure.
the
statute
simply
says
you
have
a
right
to
habeas
corpus,
which
the
petitioner
also
has
access
to.
but
a
six-month
period
is
the
requirement
imposed
upon
the
hospital-initiated
medical
review
which
may
lead
to
judicial
review.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
on
the
occasion
of
the
50-day
hearing,
it
is
our
submission
that
in
this
case
he
did.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
he
is
treated
as
a
civil
committee
in
the
sense
that
his
continued
confinement
rests
upon
the
fact
that
he
is
unable
to
show
that
he
is
no
longer
mentally
ill
and
dangerous.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
he
is
entitled
to
go
to
court
periodically
to
review,
to
seek
his
release.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i'm
not
sure
the
meaning
of
that
term.
he
is
entitled
to
go
to
court
and
the
things
he
must
show
are
the
same
things
that
he
would
have
to
show.
therefore,
one
point
that
is
particularly
important
here
is
that
the
effect
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
he
seeks
something
that
a
civil
committee
would
not
have.
he
seeks
to
be
recommitted
de
novo.
that
is
a
substantial
burden
which
is
not
imposed
on
the
state
or
the
government
in
a
civil
case,
and
it
is
our
position
that
were
petitioner's
contention
to
be
accepted
criminal
committees
would
be
better
off
than
the
class
of
civil
committees,
which
strikes
us--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--we
really
don't
say
anything
about
that
issue,
frankly,
mr.
justice
stevens.
there
is
a
decision
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--in
major
respects,
he
clearly
is
treated
the
same
way.
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--the
law
of
the
d.c.
circuit--
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
--in
bolton
versus
harris
is
that
he
is,
and
there's
nothing
further.
mr.
joshua
i.
schwartz
i
frankly
do
not
know
that
the
record
reveals
that.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
i'm
sorry.
my
time
has
expired.
