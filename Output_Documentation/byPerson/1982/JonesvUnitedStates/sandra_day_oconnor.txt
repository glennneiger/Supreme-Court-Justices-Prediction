mr.
wasserstrom,
you're
not
challenging,
as
i
understand
it,
the
initial
commitment.
the
only
question,
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
that
you
raise
is
whether
he
must
be
released
at
the
time
that
the
sentence
period
would
have
expired
under
the
criminal
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
are
not
challenging,
then,
the
standard
or
burden
of
proof
at
the
time
of
his
commitment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
his
initial
commitment
is
not
punitive,
then
how
is
the
statutory
period
of
time
that
he
could
serve
on
the
criminal
charge
relevant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
for
us
to
agree
with
your
position
we
would
have
to
conclude
that
his
initial
commitment
was
punitive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
schwartz,
by
way
of
background
information,
if
you
will,
under
the
present
statutory
scheme
is
it
still
possible
for
an
automatic
commitment
to
be
made
of
a
defendant
who
doesn't
himself
raise
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
but
who
is
acquitted
on
those
grounds,
as
occurred
in
the
overholser
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
how
about,
then,
a
defendant
who
effectively
establishes
a
not
guilty
by
reason
of
temporary
insanity?
is
that
an
automatic
commitment
under
this
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are
some
crucial
procedural
differences,
aren't
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
doesn't
notice
go
to
the
prosecutor
and
you
have
an
opportunity
to
contest
it,
or
something?
