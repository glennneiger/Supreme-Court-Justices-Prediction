justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
the
statute
say
he
should
be
there
until
he's
"eligible
for
release"?
isn't
that
what
the
statute
actually
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
isn't
that
clear?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
doesn't
say
he
automatically
gets
out
in
one
year.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
he
asked
for
this,
didn't
he?
didn't
he
plead
guilty
by
insanity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
so
then
he
says...
i
don't
understand
what
the
one
year
has
to
do
with
it.
he
agreed
to
the
sentence,
that
he
should
be
there
until
he
could
be
released--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--in
very
broad
terms.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
law
says...
the
law
doesn't
say
any
time
that
he
shall
be
given
this
examination,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
do
you
say
he
must
have
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
say
he
should
have
had
a
hearing
four
years
ago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that.
but
your
position
is
that's
when
he
should
have
had
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
also,
probably
the
average
person
doesn't
have
psychiatrists
waiting
around
to
testify
for
them,
isn't
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
is
there
any
organization
of
psychiatrists
like
legal
aid?
justice
thurgood
marshall
psychiatrists
aid
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
"temporary"
here
in
this
case
is
six
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
all
ears.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
any...
as
i
understand
it,
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
but
he
wasn't
insane
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
be
committed
if
you're
incompetent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
question
is,
if
you're
incompetent,
solely
incompetent,
can
you
be
committed
to
st.
elizabeth's?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
in
a
civil
commitment
be
put
in
st.
elizabeth's
because
you're
incompetent?
and
the
answer
is
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
understand
that
in
this
case
they
said
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
he
committed
the
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
was
he
committed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
was
no
hearing
at
all
about
his
competency
at
that
time,
was
there?
i
mean,
after
he
was
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity,
was
there
any
other
hearing
held
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
before
he
was
committed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i'm
talking
about
when
he
was
committed,
there
was
no
hearing
at
all
on
whether
or
not
he
should
be
committed
to
st.
elizabeth's.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
hearing
was
whether
or
not
he
committed
the
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
was
no
hearing
on
that
day?
i've
asked
that
three
times
now.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
day
that
he
was
committed
to
st.
elizabeth's
after
he
had
been
acquitted,
was
there
or
was
there
not
a
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
it
a
civil
commitment
or
a
criminal
commitment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
both?
