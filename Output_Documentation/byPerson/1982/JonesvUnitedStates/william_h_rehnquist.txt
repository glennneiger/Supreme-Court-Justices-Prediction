justice
william
h.
rehnquist
addington
was
a
case
where
the
person
was
being
committed
and
it
was
suggested
that
he
was
insane
for
the
first
time.
here
your
client
was
the
one
who
raised
the
insanity
and
persuaded
the
court
that
he
was
insane.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
didn't
enter
into
the
court's
assessment,
i
don't
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
a
different
burden
of
proof
would
attach
if
he
was
being
committed
for
the
first
time?
do
you
think
that
can
be
fairly
derived
from
addington?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
case
mentioned
one
of
the
interests
is
not
being
stigmatized.
your
client
brought
the
stigma
on
himself
by
pleading
insanity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says
there
are
two
interests,
one
the
one
you've
just
described
and
one
the
stigma.
i
didn't
realize
it
had
treated
them
as
disparate
interests.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
addington
says
that
in
so
many
words?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
invites
that
by
pleading
insanity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
society
can
certainly
take
into
account
his
behavior
in
the
criminal
trial
and
what
he
has
asserted
there
in
determining
what
should
happen
to
him
thereafter.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schwartz,
was
that
in
effect
an
overruling
of
davis
against
the
united
states
by
the
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
effect
it
was
an
overruling
of
davis.
