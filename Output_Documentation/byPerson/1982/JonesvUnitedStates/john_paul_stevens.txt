justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
question
about
your
legal
theory.
are
you
primarily
relying
on
the
due
process
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
troubles
me
about
your
due
process
argument,
supposing
we
have
precisely
the
same
facts,
say
in
texas,
and
say
in
texas
they
had
a
maximum
sentence
of
ten
years
for
this
offense.
i
take
it
under
your
theory
there
would
be
no
due
process
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
otherwise...
different
process
is
required
depending
on
the
length
of
the
sentence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
if
your
case
turns
on
a
comparison
between
his
treatment
and
the
treatment
of
a
person
who
is
convicted
of
the
offense,
you're
really
in
the
final
analysis
relying
on
the
equal
protection
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wasserstrom,
if
you
rely
on
a
comparison
to
the
criminal
proceeding
to
judge
the
adequacy
of
the
insanity
procedures,
would
it
be
constitutional
to
do
away
with
the
50-day
hearing
that
you
now
have
and
substitute
a
hearing
at
the
time
when
the
man
first
becomes
eligible
for
parole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
just
thinking
that
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is,
would
it
be
permissible
to
govern
the
scheduling
of
potential
release
hearings
by
a
schedule
that
just
paralleled
what
would
be
appropriate
if
the
man
had
not
been
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
do.
do
i
understand,
one
of
your
positions
is
that
the
50-day
hearing
in
this
case,
it
was
equivalent
to
a
hearing
at
which
the
government
sustained
the
burden
of
proof
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
and
therefore
is
tantamount
to
a
civil
commitment?
are
you
in
effect
arguing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
not
entirely
clear
on
what
your
view
of
the
legal
significance
of
that
having
been
tantamount
to
a
civil
commitment
hearing
would
be.
are
you
saying
that
his
subsequent
history
has
been
the
same
as
if
he
had
been
civilly
committed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
he
get
the
same
periodic
review
by
the
head
of
the
hospital
and
all
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schwartz,
isn't
this
much
true?
it's
awfully
hard
to
get
all
these
procedures
in
mind,
but
that
if
he
were
committed
as
a
civil
committee
under
the
normal
civil
procedures
he
would
be
entitled
to
have
every
six
months,
at
no
less...
no
greater
period
than
every
six
months,
the
chief
of
the
hospital
make
an
independent
review
of
the
status?
he's
not
entitled
to
that.
you
don't
say
he's
now
entitled
to
that,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
don't
you
have
to
say
something
about
it?
if
you're
saying
he's
treated
exactly
as
though
he
were
a
civil
committee,
don't
you
have
to
tell
us
whether
that
means
he
gets
the
same
periodic
review
that
a
civil
committee
gets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
particular
respects?
let
me
get
that
straight.
in
this
particular
respect,
is
he
entitled
to
the
periodic
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view
of
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
he
received
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question.
i
understand
your
position,
there
was
not
clear
and
convincing
evidence
at
that
hearing.
but
assume
that
we
thought
there
was
just
for
purposes
of
my
question.
would
there
be
anything
left
of
your
case?
and
assume
not
only
that
there
was
clear
and
convincing,
but
that
the
judge
said,
i
think
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
and
i
so
find.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
more
question,
if
i
may,
because
i'm
still
not
entirely
clear
on
your
position.
assume
there
were
a
50-day
hearing,
clear
and
convincing
proof,
and
i
know
this
is
not
realistic,
but
there
were
also
a
jury
trial.
are
you
complaining
of
any
difference
in
the
treatment
of
your
client
after
that
date
and
the
treatment
he
would
have
received
had
he
initially
been
committed
in
a
civil
proceeding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
difference
in
the
sense
of
ability
to
obtain
his
release?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
haven't
really
relied
on
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
case
really
boils
down
to
the
absence
of
what
you
consider
to
be
a
necessary
predicate
for
indefinite
detention,
namely
a
clear
and
convincing
showing
in
a
civil
hearing?
