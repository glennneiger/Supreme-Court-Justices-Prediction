right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
form
the
district
of
colombia
court
of
appeals.
in
the
district,
a
criminal
defendant
is
acquitted
if
he
can
establish
an
insanity
defense
by
preponderance
of
evidence.
he
is
then
committed
to
a
mental
hospital.
in
1975,
petitioner
jones
was
arrested
on
charges
of
attempted
larceny,
a
crime
punishable
by
a
maximum
sentence
of
one
year
imprisonment.
he
successfully
pleaded
insanity
and
was
committed
to
a
mental
hospital.
after
jones
had
been
hospitalized
for
longer
than
a
year,
he
demanded
a
civil
commitment
hearing
at
which
it
would
be
the
government's
burden
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
was
mentally
ill
and
dangerous.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument.
a
judgment
of
not
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity
establishes
two
facts,
first,
that
the
defendant
committed
a
criminal
act
and
second,
that
he
did
so
because
of
mental
illness.
we
hold
that
these
findings
sufficiently
demonstrate
mental
illness
and
dangerousness.
this
is
necessary.
the
involuntary
commitment
is
necessary,
both
for
the
treatment
of
the
defendant
and
for
protection
of
society.
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
required
to
support
a
civil
commitment
but
where
a
defendant
elects
to
plead
insanity,
a
judgment
on
such
plead
is
lawful
when
supported
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
petitioner
argues
also
that
he
may
not
be
confined
to
an
institution
for
a
longer
period
of
time
than
he
would
have
served
in
prison,
but
a
sentence
of
incarceration
is
based
on
a
variety
of
punitive
factors
not
relevant
to
a
hospital
commitment.
moreover,
the
statute
provides
several
ways
and
an
insanity
acquittee
may
obtain
release
including
the
right
to
a
judicial
hearing
every
six
months.
jones
has
not
yet
been
able
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
he
has
recovered
from
his
illness.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
marshall
and
blackmun.
justice
stevens
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
