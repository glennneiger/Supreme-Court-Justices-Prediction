justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wasserstrom,
he
had
the
initial
50-day
release
hearing,
did
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
event,
i
gather
at
the
conclusion
of
that
that
his
confinement
to
st.
elizabeth's
was
continued?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
the
second
hearing
six
months
later
or
some
time
longer
after?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
initiate...
did
he
request
it
at
that
time,
after
he
had
been
confined
over
a
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
the...
that
actually
then
is
the
sequence
before
the
case
gets
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
six
years
ago.
at
the
50-day
hearing,
there
was
evidence
taken,
wasn't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
was
one
stage
in
this
proceeding,
as
i
understand
it,
when
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
civil
commitment
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
reason
this
has
all
taken
six
years
to
get
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
it
were
a
life
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
schwartz,
he
was
entitled
after
the
50-day
period
periodically
to
further
hearings,
was
he
not?
how
long
are
those
periods?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
what
i'm
coming
to...
i
know
your
time
is
running,
and
i
don't
want
to
take
it...
is
there
a
distinction
between
periodic
hearings
for
civil
committees
and
this
kind
of
committee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
the
periods
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
you
suggested
to
my
brother
stevens
that
he
in
effect
had
all
the
procedures
that
a
civil
committee
gets
on
the
occasion
of
the
50-day
hearing,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
if
he
had
been
a
civil
committee.
well,
since
that
date
has
he
been
treated
as
a
civil
committee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
entitled
to
demand
a
periodic
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
civil
committee
or
as
a
criminal
committee?
