justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
correct
that
insofar
as
the
florida
supreme
court
was
talking
about
the
boarding
and
the
stopping,
it
relied
on
federal
cases.
and
then
when
it
got
to
the
search,
it
cited
the
statute,
and
from
that
point
on
in
its
opinion
it
cited
nothing
but
florida
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
asking
us
to
reverse
the
portion
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion
that
cites
nothing
but
florida
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
talking
about
the
majority
opinion,
you're
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
answer
is
florida
doesn't
have
to
follow
those
cases
if
it
doesn't
want
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
in
all
doubtful
cases,
we
should
assume
there's
jurisdiction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
agree
this
is
a
doubtful
case?
you're
saying
that
presumption
should
be
in
favor
of
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
supports
you.
