justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--didn't
she
also
say
that
really
what
she
was
inspecting
for
was
illegal
seafood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
make
a
difference
whether
the
search
was
made
for
safety
violations
or
for
illegal
seafood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
it
was
putrefying
fish
or
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
actually
she
was
inspecting
only
for
illegal
seafood,
nothing
to
do
with
a
safety
violation.
she
hadn't
any
authority
to
do
that,
did
she?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
inspect
for
illegal
seafood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
inspect
for
illegal
seafood?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
state
statute
cover
all
of
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
matter
what
the
purpose
of
the
inspection
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
there's
a
state
statutory
probable
cause
requirement,
whether
it's
for
illegal
fishing
or
for
safety
violations,
is
an
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
there
a
state
statutory
probable
cause
requirement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
require
probable
cause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
if
the
holding
is
that
there
was
a
probable
cause
requirement
as
required
by
state
statute,
why
doesn't
this
case
turn
on
an
adequate
state
ground;
why
do
we
have
to
get
into
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose...
if
we
read
what
the
florida
supreme
court
says,
that
they
turned
this
on
the
statutory
probable
cause
requirement,
because
that's
the
basis
of
it,--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--well,
i
know,
but
both
of
those
were
state
cases,
weren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
asking
you
if
we
don't
read
it
the
way
you
suggest
we
should
and
we
find
that
it
did
rest
on
that
state
probable
cause
requirement,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case
as
far
as
we're
concerned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
not
arguing
that
the
judgment
rests
on
an
adequate
state
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
mccormick,
are
you
talking
about
the
arrests
for
not
having
a
registration
statement?
not
having
a
registration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
page
28
i
think
of
your
brief
you
say
that
those
arrests
were
false
arrests.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
the
one
for
not
having
a
registration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
arrest
was
federally
infirm?
are
you
saying
that
was
federally
infirm?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
constitutionally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
premise
of
your
argument
that
this
judgment,
then,
rests
on
an
adequate
state
ground?
