justice
byron
r.
white
it
smells
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
question
that
the
florida
court
thought
the
stop
was
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
boarding.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
boarding.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
legally
on
the
boat.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
argument
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
you
and
justice
brennan
are
discussing
is
what
occurs
after
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
boarding?
you
were
rejected
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
are
judging
this
case
as
though
the
boarding
was
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
was
the
boarding
constitutional
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
said
the
stop
and
the
boarding
was
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
processed
an
appeal
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
so
we
judge
it
as
though
the
boarding
was
legal
and
from
then
on,
you
say
whatever
happened
was
enough
to
sustain
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
know
that
was
an
issue
here,
the
legality
of
the
boarding.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
can't
rest
on
that
point
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
can't
rest
on
that
point
at
all.
don't
we
judge
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
officers
were
legally
on
the
vessel?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
under
florida
law
he
could
not
have
been
arrested
for
not
having
a
boat
registration
certificate
onboard.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
under
florida
law
it
was
lawful,
that
having
a
registration
certificate
onboard
was
required,
and
that
you
could
arrest
for
not
having
it.
and
suppose
the
officer
said
to
the
captain,
well,
you
don't
have
a
registration
certificate
so
we're
arresting
you
for
that.
now,
if
that
was
a
lawful
arrest,
the
only
way
it
could
have
been
lawful
is
if
it
were
lawful
without
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
are
you
saying
that
they
needed
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
didn't
have
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
florida
supreme
court
says
they
were
required.
justice
byron
r.
white
anyway,
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
says
that
he
could
not...
the
registration
certificate
could
not
be
located.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
after
having
said
that
the
certificate
was
legally
required
to
be
onboard.
anyway,
they
were
legally
on
the
vessel;
there
was
no
registration
certificate
to
be
found.
and
if
they
could
be
arrested
for
that...
there
was
no
misrepresentation,
i
suppose,
then,
about
the
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
suggesting,
which
may
be
quite
right,
that
under
florida
law,
even
if
you
need
a
registration
certificate
onboard,
even
if
you
can
be
arrested
for
not
having
it,
you
may
not
search
the
rest
of
the
vessel,
or
search
the
vessel
at
all,
unless
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
you're
going
to
find
something
besides
the
non-existence
of
a
registration
certificate.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that's
florida
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't.
justice
stevens
suggested
to
you
that
the
requirement
of
probable
cause
is...
that
was
imposed
on
these
officers
is
purely
florida
law.
even
if
they
could
have
arrested
for
not
having
a
registration
certificate.
