ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
search
of
the
san
rafael
was
authorized
pursuant
to
an
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
warrant
requirement
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
on
september
18,
1977,
officer
soli
and
officer
walker,
both
marine
patrol
officers
with
the
florida
marine
patrol
were
traveling
along
near
sugarloaf
key
which
is
close
to
key
west.
they
were
on
their
way
back.
their
tour
of
duty
had
almost
ended
and
they
were
returning
to
port
when
they
came
upon
the
san
rafael.
within
50
feet
of
the
boat
they
put
their
spotlight
on
the
boat,
and
approaching
the
boat
identified
themselves
as
marine
patrol
officers
and
asked,
at
that
point,
if
they
could
see
the
registration
papers
or
the
registration
certificate
for
the
boat
which
is
required
pursuant
to
florida
statutes.
at
that
point,
two
individuals
who
had
departed
the
cabin
area
came
to
the
side
of
the
boat
and
produced
papers.
those
papers
did
not
comport
with
the
statute
requirement,
but
rather,
were
documentation
papers
of
unspecified
nature,
and
tax
receipts
reflecting
the
purchase
of
the
boat.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
those
boats
that
travel
in
the
waters
and
conduct
fishing
activities
in
that
area,
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
believe
it
does.
i
believe
the
statute...
if
there's
a
penalty,
a
second
degree
penalty
for
failure
to
have
it
aboard
and
available,
upon
that
showing...
the
officers
are
not
really...
even
having
to
board
the
boat
is
a
matter
of
standing
on
their
own
boat
and
asking
do
you
have
it.
it's
not
a
matter
of
having
to
board
the
boat
in
this
instance.
and
if
it's
not
available
they
can,
in
fact,
arrest
the
individuals
because
those
statutes
are
very
clear
with
regard
to--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
believe
it
is
part
of
the
petitioner's
reply
to
the
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
i
think
he
can
put
that
as
part
of
his
pleadings.
but
specifically,
the
statutes
applicable
with
regard
to
having
the
registration
onboard
is
371.051,
subsection
5.
and
that's
of
the
1977
statutes.
there
has
been
a
modification,
and
so
i
do
not
have
the
change
because
i
was
looking
specifically
at
the
applicable
statutes.
once
there
was
no
response
by
the
defendants
for
the
certification
papers,
officer
soli,
because
of
the
bobbing
of
the
boats,
asked
if
she
could
board
the
boat.
at
that
point,
consent
was
given
and
she
made
a
statement
at
the
suppression
hearing
and
at
trial
that
the
reason
she
was
boarding
was
to
help
them
find
these
papers
and
also,
to
conduct
a
search,
to
do
her
duty,
is
what
she
said.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that
came...
there
was
a
statement
to
that
effect
later
on,
but
she
was
initially
going
onboard
for
was
for
safety
inspection
and
to
help
them
find
the
papers.
they
apparently
were
confused
with
regard
to
papers.
they
said
no,
they
didn't
have
them,
but
they
were
not
the
owners
of
the
boat,
nor
did
the
papers
that
they
did
tender
have
their
names
on
it.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
the
search,
the
subsequent
search?
we
have
contended
that
there
are
three
bases
upon
which
the
florida
supreme
court
could
have
legitimatized
the
search,
and
that
the
court
missed
its
mark,
actually,
when
they
found
that
the
initial
stop
was
correct.
we
have
contended
first
of
all,
that
an
inspection
was
lawfully
to
ensue,
and
that
by
not
holding
that
that
inspection
was
valid
in
this
case,
they
missed
their
mark.
but
secondly,
we
said
that
as
the
circumstances
developed
in
this
case,
and
that
is
where
officer
soli
followed
the
respondents
to
the
cabin
area
of
the
boat,
she
asked
if
she
could
look
into
the
ice
chest
there,
and
they
gave
consent
for
that.
this
is
part
of
her
inspection.
she
opens
it
up,
finds
no
ice
and
finds
that
there
are
some
bits
of
food
that
have
been
rotting
in
there.
now,
this
triggered--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
don't
remember
it
being
putrefying
fish.
all
i
remember
is
rotten
food.
but
if
that
was
what
the
record--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes,
i
think
it
stinks.
the
point
being--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--she
has
authority...
that's
part
of
the
scope
of
their
authority,
once
they're
lawfully
aboard
the
boat.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
pardon
me?
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
part
of
their
function,
part
of
the
marine
patrol
function
in
florida
is
to
maintain
boating
safety
and
to
maintain
the
maritime,
the
fisheries
and
control
or
regulate
fishing
in
the
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
perhaps
the
majority
of
their
work.
they
look
for
individuals
who
sell
shorttails--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
the
statute
is
very
clear
as
to
the
regulatory
responsibilities
and
the
duties
of
the
marine
patrol
with
regard
to
investigating
all
activities
concerning
marine
life
and
boating.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
also
have
a
general
proviso
in
their
authority
that
they
have
the
right
to
investigate
and
arrest
for
all
violations
of
law
of
florida.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
there's
a
state
statutory
requirement
to
board
the
boat;
371.58
says--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--it
requires
either
consent
or
probable
cause
to
board
the
boat
for
a
safety
inspection.
the
state
would
contend
that
the
officers
in
this
case
had
both
the
probable
cause
and
consent
to
board
the
boat
for
the
safety
inspection
when
the
papers
were
not
produced.
there
was
something
awry
with
this
boat,
and
that
was
sufficient
probable
cause
to
board.
but
more
importantly,
the
record
reflects,
and
of
course--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--because
the
probable
cause
that
the
florida
supreme
court
found
the
search
to
be
in
violation
of
was
a
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
finding
as
opposed
to
the
state
statute.
i
think
the
state
statute
is
limited
to
boarding
the
boat
for
inspection.
the
state
statute
is
very
clear;
it
says
that
you
have
to
have
consent
of
the
owner
or
probable
cause
for
the
officer,
so
he
may
board
the
boat
to
conduct
an
inspection,
to
check
safety
equipment.
that
is
not
the
probable
cause
that
the
florida
supreme
court
found
to
be
the
culprit
in
this
particular
case
with
regard
to
the
searching
of
the
ice
hold
which
came
subsequent
to
this.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
they
cite
to
two
cases.
they
cite
to
hill
and
they
cite
to
tingley
versus
brown.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
they
are,
but
they
are
not
squarely
on
what
we're
suggesting
is
the
probable
cause.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
well,
sir,
i
think...
and
to
answer
your
question
is
a
yes/no
proposition.
yes,
if
you
really
push
me
to
the
wall,
but
no
because
i
believe
this
court
has
modified
its
review
of
an
ambiguous
holding
by
a
supreme
court.
in
delaware
versus
prouse
you
did
it,
and
apparently,
and
i
really
must
admit--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
pursuant
to
delaware
v.
prouse,
that
it
just--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--and
the
boarding,
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
oh,
yes.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that
we're
trying
to
get--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--exactly.
and
i'm
suggesting
that
the
probable
cause
of
the
statute,
371.58,
does
not
concern
the
search.
that
follows
straight
line
fourth
amendment,
which
the
florida
supreme
court
has
always
followed.
but
that
initial
boarding
had
to
be
either
probable
cause
or
consent,
and
that
was
what
the
statute
was
to
control.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that
is
true,
but
i
think
that
is
because
only
of
its
own
practice
of
citing
its
own
decisions--
there's
a
problem
in
this
particular
case
because
the
third
district
court
of
appeals
who
originally
saw
this
on
the
appellate
level
did
not
even
address
the
search
because
they
cut
us
off
at
the
pass
when
they
nixed
us
on
the
initial
stop.
so
therefore,
that
particular
issue
was
not
developed.
it
was
only
developed
when
we
got
to
the
florida
supreme
court
and
we
had
lost.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
the
majority
cites
nothing
but
florida
authority.
the
minority,
justice
alderman
and
justice
mcdonald
disagree
and
say
how
can
you
apply
the
fourth
amendment--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--they
cite
to
chimel
and
they
cite
to
carroll
and
they
say
how
could
you
have
done
this
in
this
particular
case.
because
clearly,
clearly--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--well,
that
is
certainly
one
outcome,
but
florida
has
been...
and
there's
a
host
of
cases
starting
with
state
versus
hetlin
that
have
always...
and
i
repeat
always...
applied
fourth
amendment
in
the
same
way
fourth
amendment
is
to
be
applied
federally.
i
mean,
that
is
the
practice
of
the
state.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
article
i,
section
12
is
in
line
with
that,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
just
modified...
this
last
election
year
we
had
a
referendum
to
codify
how
we
are
going
to
interpret
it,
and
that
is
by
seizing
upon
decisions
of
this
court
in
its
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
so
as
far
as
search
and
seizure
is
concerned,
we
are
following
the
fourth
amendment,
and
if
the
court
is
talking
about
it,
i
believe
their
opinion
is
ambiguous
at
best,
but
certainly
in
the
mode
of
the
fourth
amendment
review.
and
certainly,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
in
that
vein.
once
we're
on
the
boat--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--no,
your
honor.
i
appreciate
the
problem--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--i
think
this
is
a
close
case
to
delaware
versus
prouse,
and
that
case
is
the
case...
you've
accepted
that,
and
i
appreciate
that
in
yesterday's
decision.
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
read
it,
but
there
was
a
problem
in
that
case.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
yes.
[laughter]
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
read
it
but
i
thought
it
might.
but
the
point
is
that
we
don't
really
feel
we
have
that
kind
of
a
problem
in
this
particular
instance,
and
the
history
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
review
of
the
fourth
amendment
has
always
been
under
the
united
states
constitution's
application
of
it.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that
the
state
was
perhaps
a
little
remiss
in
its
briefing
of
the
case
because
we
were
concerned
with
getting
the
stop
found
to
be
okay,
and
we
did
not
ever
think
in
our
mind
that
we
would
lose
the
search.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
i
am
suggesting--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that's
right.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
that's
right.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
they
just
didn't
find
them
persuasive,
i
would
submit.
and
i
might
add
there
was
a
rehearing--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--that
they
ruled
on
a
fourth
amendment
ground
as
opposed
to
an
independent
state
issue?
or
that
they're
applicable,
the
fourth
amendment
is
applicable.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
appreciate
your
question.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
right.
they
cited--
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
--your
honor,
i
don't
know...
i
cannot
pretend
to
understand
what
you
would
draw
from
that.
what
i
would
draw
from
that
is
that
they
just
did
not
appreciate
the
impact
that
those
cases...
and
their
applicability
to
this
particular
instance.
because
again,
the
nature
of
the
case...
it
came
up
to
the
florida
supreme
court
on
certiorari
review,
conflict
certiorari
review,
regarding
the
initial
stop.
the
subsequent
search,
which
became
the
subject
matter
for
grounds
before
this
court,
was
a
secondary
issue
that
they
fortuitously
resolved.
once
the
officers
were
onboard...
or
officer
soli
was
onboard
the
boat,
at
that
point
officer
soli
asked
if
they
could
check
the
ice
hold
that
was
in
the
front
of
the
boat.
garcia
indicated
that...
do
you
have
a
warrant.
officer
soli
said
i'd
like
to
check
for
fish
products.
he
says,
do
you
have
a
warrant.
at
that
point,
officer
walker
testified
in
the
suppression
hearing
and
at
the
trial
that,
we
do
not
need
a
warrant;
we
are
not
going
to
search,
you're
under
arrest
for
failing
to
have
certificate
papers,
your
registration
papers.
at
that
point,
no
time
went
by,
based
on
everybody's
testimony.
garcia
says,
you
got
me,
in
essence,
there's
marijuana
all
over
the
boat.
at
that
point,
miranda
warnings
were
given,
the
officers
asked
him
to
reconfirm
what
he
said.
he
said
there's
marijuana
on
the
boat.
at
that
point,
officer
walker
asked
if
they
would
accompany
officer
soli
to
the
ice
hold,
at
which
point
the
top
or
the
lid
was
removed
and
marijuana...
the
aroma
of
marijuana
was
everywhere
and
apparently,
leaf
materials...
it
was
just
filled
to
the
gills
with
marijuana.
the
state
contends
that
the
minority
opinion
by
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
case
was
instant
to
a
lawful
arrest,
that
it
was
a
probable
cause
search
and
that,
indeed,
indeed,
the
search
of
the
ice
hold
would
have
been
justified
pursuant
to
an
inspection
type
check,
all
justified
the
search,
and
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
incorrect
in
finding
that
there
was
no
consent
and
no
probable
cause.
i
think
a
review
of
the
decisions
concerning
consent...
and
i
think
the
reason
i
am
going
to
consent
is
that
although
the
state
never
specifically
argued
that
consent
was
given
to
search
the
ice
hold,
even
though
there
was
this
kind
of
open
statement
like
there's
marijuana
all
over
the
boat,
the
state
would
contend
that
the
fact
that
somebody's
in
custody,
that
they're
not
able
to
leave...
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
must
be
reviewed,
and
in
this
particular
instance
the
consent
was
there.
but
more
importantly,
the
statement
that
was
given
was
not
coerced
in
any
way,
fashion
or
form.
and,
therefore,
there
was
sufficient...
at
that
point,
when
the
officer
heard
that
garcia
said
there
is
marijuana
all
over
the
boat,
it
developed
the
requisite
probable
cause
to
conduct
the
search
of
the
entire
boat,
as
this
court
has
suggested
in
ross.
more
importantly,
as
soon
as
garcia
and
mr.
casal
were
under
arrest,
the
search
instant
to
a
lawful
arrest
was
appropriate
under
belton.
we're
talking
about
a
vessel
which
is
no
different
than
the
automobile
and
certainly,
the
area
that
was
to
be
searched
was
not
a
private
sector
of
the
boat,
it
was
not
someone's
locker
on
the
boat;
it
was
a
fish
hold
that...
there
are
federal
district
court
cases
that
have
held
that
even
the
fish
hold
is
not
a
private
sector;
it's
open
to
the
public
and
does
not
contain
privacy
protections.
based
on
these
three
arguments,
the
state
would
contend
that
the
florida
supreme
court
erred
in
determining
that
the
particular
search
herein
was
unlawful.
thank
you.
ms.
carolyn
m.
snurkowski
no,
your
honor.
