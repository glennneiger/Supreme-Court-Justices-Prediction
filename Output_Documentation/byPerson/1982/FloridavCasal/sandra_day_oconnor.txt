justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
something
right
here.
now,
does
florida
law
require
every
boat
to
have
a
registration
certificate?
is
that
clear?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
the
absence
of
a
registration
certificate
give
a
right
for
a
valid
custodial
arrest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
statute
part
of
our--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
ever
challenge
the
propriety
of
the
arrest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
concede
now
that
the
arrest
was
lawful?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
says
that
in
this
case,
consent
was
freely
given
to
board
the
vessel
and
to
look
in
the
icebox.
now,
we
have
to
take
that
as
the
correct
finding,
do
we
not?
you
didn't
come
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
dispute
that.
we
have
to
assume
those
things
are
true.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
can't
ask
us
to
disregard
that
state
court's
factfinding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion,
however,
says,
and
i
quote,
"they"
meaning
the
officers,
"then
asked
to
see
the
boat's
registration
certification,
which
is
legally
required
to
be
onboard.
"
and
they
cite
a
statute.
and
we're
supposed
to
disregard
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
were
dealing
with
this
particular
case,
though.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they've
told
us
in
this
case
in
that
sentence
that
it
was
legally
required.
