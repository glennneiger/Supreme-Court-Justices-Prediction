mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendants
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
withheld.
the
grounds
that
are
being
offered
by
the
defendants
in
support
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court,
are,
number
one,
that
the
stopping
was
unlawful;
number
two,
that
the
search
was
unlawful;
number
three,
that
there
was
a
deception
that
was
exercised
by
the
police
officers
in
the
process
of
representing
that
a
search
warrant
was
not
necessary;
and
number
four,
that
the
arrest
was
also
unlawful.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
sir,
that
also.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
no,
i
wasn't
totally
rejected,
as
in
the
brief
by
the
state
i
was
accused
of
using
a
thunderbust,
and
so
i'm
somewhat
restricting
my
shot
right
now
and
eliminating
the
boarding
aspect
of
it.
based
upon
the
arguments
in
the
prior
case,--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--the
boarding
i
don't
believe
was
by
consent
because--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--if
it
was
not
by
consent
then
it
wasn't
constitutional.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
the
florida
supreme
court,
in
interpreting
the
facts--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--they
said
that--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--no,
sir,
i
haven't.
but
as
far
as
the
grounds
for
supporting
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
i'm
not
implying
that
the
boarding
was
unlawful.
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
can
be
withheld,
i
mean,
can
be
sustained
without
analyzing
the
boarding
aspect
of
it.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
judge,
that,
if
you
see
that
the
boarding
was
illegal,
i
don't
want
to
disagree
with
you
in
that
respect
at
all.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
i'm
not
raising
it
at
this
point,
judge.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
and
this
is
the
last
time.
no,
sir.
the
reply
brief
of
the
state
objects
to
the
analysis
of
the
case
on
these
points
by
the
defendants.
we
are
satisfied
with
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
and
that
being
the
case,
we
did
not
file
any
cross-petition
seeking
certiorari.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
ma'am.
is
that
the
propriety
of
the
arrest
was
challenged
initially
by
a
written
pleading
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
and
that
was
back
on
april
3,
1977.
the
arrest
was
objected
to
and
that
was
used
as
one
of
the
grounds
for
the
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
no,
ma'am.
our
position
is
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
in
addition
to
that,
before
the
third
district
court
of
appeals,
our
brief
on
page
21
contains
our
objection
to
the
arrest.
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
our
answer
brief
on
page
18,
19
and
40,
and
argument
number
vii.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
by
that
i
mean
that
they
were
unlawful.
is
that
there
was
no
reasonable
grounds
to
believe...
i'm
talking
now
about
the
initial
arrests.
actually,
we've
got
two
arrests
involved.
we've
got
the
first
arrest--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--they
never
perfected
that.
they
told
the
men
onboard,
they
said,
you're
under
arrest,
but
they
never
followed
it
up
by
any
type
of
a
citation
or
anything
else.
that
is
the
arrest
that
i'm
talking
about
that
was
unlawful.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
no.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
i'm
saying
that
it
was
unlawful
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
florida,
and
by
the
same
token,
if
there
wasn't
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
when
they
were
arrested
for
not
having
the
registration
papers,
by
the
same
token,
it
would
be
federally
infirm.
we're
attacking
the...
or,
we're
supporting
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
these
grounds,
based
primarily
upon
the
langley
struck
doctrine,
the
decision
by
justice
cardozo
in
the
mauley
construction
and
maryland
casualty
case,
as
well
as
gresman
supreme
court
practice,
477,
479.
the
state,
in
its
presentation
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
believe
there
should
be
some
additions
to
it
in
order
that
the
total
picture
can
be
appreciated
in
deciding
this
case.
is
that
to
begin
with,
this
was
off
of
sugarloaf
key,
is
that...
i
don't
know
if
you
justices
are
familiar
with
the
keys,
but
sugarloaf
is
between
marathon
and
key
west,
and
it's
a
rather
remote
area
of
the
florida
keys
and
it
was
approximately
three
miles
offshore.
it
was
about
1:00
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
the
seas
were
rough.
the
evidence
was
that
the
marine
patrol
had
a
suspicion
that
there
was
lobster
being
stolen
from
fishermen's
traps
in
this
area.
further
was
the
evidence
that
they
had
no
reason
for
suspicion
of
any
kind
that
the
defendants
were
involved
in
any
type
of
illegal
activity.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
both
of
the
marine
patrol
officers
said
that
when
they
approached
the
vessel
they
had
no
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
any
kind
that
these
men
were
transgressors
of
the
law.
nevertheless,
they
decided
to
stop
the
vessel.
the
vessel
at
this
time
was
approximately
three
miles
offshore,
the
seas
were
very
rough
and
they
approached
the
vessel
from
the
stern,
and
then
threw
the
floodlight
on
when
they
were
approximately
50
feet
away.
one
of
the
officers
asked
the
pilot
of
the
san
rafael
to
take
the
vessel
out
of
gear
and
to
bring
it
to
a
stop.
of
course,
it's
bring
it
to
a
stop
as
best
you
can
considering
the
roughness
of
the
sea.
when
a
vessel
is
brought...
is
taken
out
of
gear
when
the
seas
are
rough,
it
has
a
tendency
to
be
be
thrown
in
the
direction
that
the
sea
wishes
it
to
be
thrown.
is
that
you
lose
control
of
a
vessel
when
you
take
it
out
of
gear
in
heavy
seas.
the
record
indicates
that
the
marine
patrol
boat
was
pulled
up
alongside
of
the
san
rafael
and
that
the
two
vessels
were
pounding
together
in
the
heavy
sea
while
the
marine
patrol
officer
questioned
the
men
onboard
if
they
had
their
registration
papers.
i
believe
at
this
juncture
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
as
far
as
the
registration
law,
is
that
florida
has
its
registration
law
for
power
boats,
motor
boats
as
they're
called.
most
states
have
their
own
individual
laws
for
registering
motor
boats.
it
used
to
be
that
the
federal
government
had
the
exclusive
right
in
this
area,
but
then
they
delegated
this
to
the
states
and
permitted
the
states
to
pass
their
own
registration
laws.
florida
passed
it,
and
by
definition
under
the
act,
is
that
they
state
that
all
motor
boats...
and
i
believe
this
has
application
to
an
inquiry
by
you,
justice
powell,
is
that
all
motor
boats
must
be
registered.
but
then
what
they
do
is
they
say
that
the
following
vessels
are
not
to
be
considered
as
motor
boats
under
the
act.
they
talk
about
boats
strictly
used
for
racing,
they
talk
about
other
vessels
from
other
states
where
they
are
properly
registered.
and
more
importantly,
they
say
documented
vessels
are
not
labeled
as
motor
boats,
and
they
don't
have
to
have
registration
papers.
the
evidence
was
at
this
point
that
the
defendants
produced
the
documentation
papers
for
the
vessel.
and
even
though
the
documentation
papers
were
produced
clearly
indicating
to
the
police
officers
that
registration
papers
were
not
necessary,
they
insisted
upon
the
registration
papers.
officer
soli
then
requested
permission
to
get
aboard,
and
at
this
time
the
boats
are
still
pounding
together
in
the
heavy
seas,
and
there's
no
indication
inside
of
the
record
that
permission
was
ever
granted.
all
it
is
is
that
she
proceeded
to
get
aboard
and
was
given
assistance
while
getting
aboard
by
the
defendants.
once
aboard,
she
immediately
engaged
in
a
search
of
the
vessel.
is
that
she
states
that
the
purpose
of
going
onboard...
her
true
purpose
in
going
onboard
was
to
find
seafood
products.
the
florida
statute
on
point
370.021
specifically
states
that
there
must
be
reason
to
believe
that
the
conservation
law
has
been
violated
in
order
for
the
marine
patrol
officer
to
conduct
a
search
of
a
vessel
in
that
respect.
so
in
violation
of
that
section
of
the
florida
statute,
she
nevertheless
proceeded
to
try
and
search
the
vessel.
the
first
area
she
went
into
was
the
wheelhouse.
the
record
indicates
that
she
followed
the
men
into
the
wheelhouse.
she
didn't
receive
any
consent
to
go
into
the
wheelhouse;
she
just
went
into
it
from
the
cockpit.
she
then
went
into
the
grocery
box,
and
she
wasn't
looking
for
the
registration
papers
when
she
went
into
the
grocery
box.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
well,
if
the
captain
indicated
that
he
should
follow,
then
i
would
go
along
with
you,
but
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that
the
captain
indicated
to
him
to
follow.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
the
record
indicates
that
once
office
soli
got
onboard,
she
immediately
commenced
to
search
for
seafood
products.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
but
then
she
went
into
the
grocery
box,
and
she
wasn't
following
the
captain
when
she
went
into
the
grocery
box.
she
was
really
conducting
a
search.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
i
did
not
cross-petition,
and
i
believe
it's
our
position
that
it's
not
necessary
for
us
to
cross-petition
based
upon
the
langley-cardozo
decision.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
well,
that's
the
reason
why
i
said
i
don't
want
to
have
our
position
rely
strictly
upon
the
boarding
or
the
illegality
of
the
boarding
of
the
vessel,
because
of
that
point.
but
now
as
far
as
the
icebox
goes,--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--pardon?
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
i
believe
so.
the
icebox
consent
was
given
to
look
in
the
icebox
but
no
place
else.
it
was
after
the
marine
patrol
officer
conducted
a
search
of
the
wheelhouse,
the
grocery
box
and
the
cabin
and
then
the
icebox
that
she
proceeded
to
the
forward
hold
and
indicated
to
garcia
that
she
wanted
to
see
what
kind
of
fish
products
mr.
garcia
had
in
the
forward
hold.
it
was
then
that
mr.
garcia
said,
do
you
have
a
search
warrant.
and
officer
soli
said
all
we
want
to
do
is
take
a
look
in
there
and
see
what
kind
of
fish
products
you
have.
and
he
again
repeated
the
question,
and
this
dialogue
was
going
on
and
officer
walker,
in
the
marine
patrol
boat
alongside
shouted
out
then
and
said,
we
don't
have
a
search
warrant,
we
don't
need
a
search
warrant.
we're
not
searching
your
boat.
you're
under
arrest
for
not
having
your
registration
papers.
and
that's
the
arrest
that
i
was
speaking
about
that
i
say
is
unlawful.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
no.
i
said
it
was
unlawful
because
the
florida
statutes
specifically
state
that
registration
papers
are
not
necessary
for
a
documented
vessel.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
no,
it
didn't.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
it's
supposed
to
be
onboard
a
vessel
for
a
motorboard,
but
this
isn't
a
motorboat.
it's
a
vessel
that
has
documentation--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
then
i
advance
this
as
an
argument
that
was
rejected
by
the
supreme
court.
and
i
believe,
according
to
the
langley
decisions
as
well
as
the
other
authorities
that
i
mentioned,
we're
able
to
advance
not
only
the
arguments
accepted
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
but
also,
those
rejected
by
the
supreme
court.
and
even
arguments
not
even
advanced
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
there's
no
indication
inside
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
that
the
arrest
was
lawful.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
no.
i'm
saying
that
it
was
an
unlawful
arrest
because
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
statute
was
violated.
the
statute
requiring
registration
papers.
registration
papers
were
not
required.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
they
weren't
required
because
it
was
a
documented
vessel.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
they
were
required
by
florida
statute
as
far
as...
there
certainly
is
a
florida
statute
that
says
that
motor
boats
must
have
registration
papers.
but
if
i
may
read
to
you
from
the
record,
this
is
a-15,
this
is
the
testimony
of
officer
walker.
"two
gentlemen
came
out
of
the
wheelhouse.
"
"i
identified
myself
as
mark
walker,
again
with
marine
patrol,
and
i
told
them
that
i
would
like
to
check
their
registration
papers
for
their
boat.
"
"question:
and
did
they
produce
the
registration
papers?
"
"answer:
at
first
he
handed
me
a
white
piece
of
paper
and
the
tax
receipt,
taxes
paid
on
the
boat.
"
"i
assumed
it
was
paid
on
the
boat.
"
"i
told
him
that
that
wasn't
what
i
wanted
to
see,
that
i
wanted
a
small
square
piece
of
paper
which
was
a
florida
registration
certificate.
"
"he
returned
and
handed
me
the
documentation
papers
for
the
vessel,
and
i
asked
him
if
he
was
captain
of
the
boat.
"
"i
don't
remember
whether
he
replied
whether
he
was
captain
or
not.
"
et
cetera.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
that's
correct.
there
was
no
registration
certificate.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
if
they
could
arrest
for
the
registration
papers,
i
think
next...
assuming
that
was
legal
for
purposes
of
argument
at
this
stage...
is
that
the
next
question
is
would
they
have
the
authority
to
search
the
vessel.
and
section
371.58
states
that
you're
able
to
conduct
a
safety
check
with
the
owner
or
operator's
consent,
or
when
there
has
been
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
part
of
that
section
has
been
violated.
now,
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
safety
requirements,
then
i
say,
yes,
you
could.
in
contrast,
if
you
don't
have
your
registration
papers
onboard,
is
that...
for
example,
if
you
don't
pay
your
income
taxes,
i
don't
think
that
would
give
them
the
authority
to
search
the
forward
hold.
and
by
the
same
token,
if
they
don't
have
the
registration
papers
onboard,
i
don't
think
that
would
give
them
the
right
to
search
the
forward
hold.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
i
would
think,
so,
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
carroll
case,
and
i
think
it's
also
consistent
with
state
versus--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--well,
that
portion
of
the
decision,
the
last
two
pages
of
the
opinion
in
chief,
that
deals
with
the
aspect
of
probable
cause
and
the
arrest
is
that
if
all
florida
statutes
that
they
talk
about,
together
with
the
hill
case
and
i
believe
the
taylor
case
and
one
other
case,
and
they
don't
mention
anywhere--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--yes,
sir,
it
certainly
does.
in
addition
to
that,
our
article
i,
section
12
of
the
florida
constitution
which
was
in
force
in
1977
and
which
was
in
force
right
straight
through
the
trial
and
the
appeals
up
until
last
year,
was
a
little
bit
broader
than
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
article
i,
section
12
even
stated
that
any
evidence
that
was
obtained...
that
was
unreasonable
could
not
be
introduced
in
court
proceedings.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
well,
they
changed
the
constitution
and
now
they're
going
along
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
yes,
sir.
it's
suggested
by
the
state
that
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest,
and
that
area,
i
believe
the
chimel
versus
california
is
still
the
law
here
before
the
supreme
court
is
that
there
has
to
be,
number
one,
a
lawful
custodial
arrest,
is
that
there's
been
no
indication
whatsoever
that
there
was
a
lawful,
custodial
arrest
here.
and
that
the
search
be
limited
to
an
area
into
which
the
arrestee
might
reach
in
order
to
grab
a
weapon
or
evidential
item.
is
that
the
forward
hold...
is
that
the
arrest
took
place
in
the
cockpit
of
the
boat.
the
forward
hold
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
cabin.
there's
a
hatch.
the
evidence
is
that
it
required
two
men,
strong
men,
to
be
able
to
lift
the
hatch,
and
before
they
could
even
get
to
it,
there's
fish
traps
located
on
top
of
the
hatch
that
have
to
be
removed.
so
this
would
certainly
not
be
an
area
where
the
arrestee
might
reach
for
a
weapon
or
perhaps
attempt
to
get
some
evidence
and
destroy
it.
the
carroll
exception
is
that...
just
briefly,
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
is
that
it's
our
contention
did
not
exist.
nor
was
there
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
was
onboard.
is
that
the
testimony
of
officer
soli
and
officer
walker
was
that
they
had
no
suspicion
whatsoever
that
there
was
any
contraband
onboard.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
testified
that
they
just
wanted
to
take
a
look
in
the
forward
hold
because
they
thought
they
might
be
able
to
locate
some
lobster.
i
don't
know
how
they're
able
to
say
that
after
they...
assuming
that
they
did
find
the
seafood
products,
that
they
could
identify
those
seafood
products
as
either
being
stolen
or
perhaps
legally
gained.
the
evidence
was
also,
by
the
testimony
of
the
officers,
that
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
boat
either
fished
in
florida
waters
or
ever
sold
fish
products
in
florida
waters.
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
the
traps
were
onboard
the
boat,
and
they--
mr.
arthur
f.
mccormick
--they
stated
that
they
were
on
the
way
to
the
bahamas.
it's
a
caysal
bank
which
is
located
almost
due
east
of
sugarloaf,
approximately
40
miles
into
the
stream.
the
further
position
of
the
state
is
that
this
was
a
lawful
administrative
inspection.
it's
our
position
that
as
far
as
it
being
a
lawful
administrative
inspection,
chapter
370
specifically
states
that
the
only
time
that
you
can
have
an
inspection
is
if
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
conservation
law
has
been
violated.
and
they,
by
their
own
testimony,
stated
they
had
no
reason
whatsoever,
even
a
suspicion,
to
believe
that
the
conservation
law
was
violated.
371
deals
with
registration
papers
and
safety
equipment.
is
that
it's
the
state's
position
now,
which
i
say
lacks
vitality
because
the
first
time
it
was
advanced
was
in
their
reply
brief.
is
that
they
say
that...
the
state
is
contending
that
the
probable
cause
was
gained
by
the
lack
of
papers
onboard,
the
registration
papers.
this
is
the
first
time
that
they
advance
this,
in
their
reply
brief.
and
it's
our
position,
of
course,
that
the
failure
to
have
registration
papers
wasn't...
that
doesn't
give
you
the
probable
cause
to
conduct
the
search.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
question
for
review,
as
indicated
in
their
brief
on
their
petition
for
certiorari,...
it
states
that
the
respondents
were
validly
arrested.
it
stated
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
so
found
that
the
respondents
were
validly
arrested,
prior
to
the
hold
of
the
boat
being
searched.
is
that
nowhere
in
the
opinion
is
there
any
indication
that
the
state
supreme
court
thought
that
the
defendants
were
validly
arrested.
and,
of
course,
this
is
a
pivotal
point,
is
that
if
you...
it
has
to
be
established
in
the
first
instance
that
there
was
a
valid
arrest.
otherwise,
everything
else
pretty
much
collapses.
lastly,
the
decision
mentioned
inside
of
the
defendants'
brief;
namely,
bumper
v.
north
carolina,
which
i
believe
is
very
similar
to
the
case
at
bar,
as
well
as,
of
course,
u.s.
v.
moat,
which
is
at
359
fed
2nd,
and
o.j.
sales,
inc.,
which
is
a
99
supreme
court
case.
is
that
similar
in
kind
where
there's
been
a
misrepresentation,
especially
if
it's
with
reference
to
a
search
warrant
or
it's
represented
to
the
defendant
that
authority
to
search
existed
when,
in
fact,
it
did
not,
is
that
any
statements
made
as
well
as
evidence
received
and
especially
consent
ostensibly
given
does
not
constitute
consent
at
all.
and
as
was
indicated
in
the
case
of
state
v.
taylor,
acquiescence
to
authority
does
not
constitute
consent.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
