when
the
minority
mentions
the
federal
cases
and
the
majority
ignores
it,
what
conclusion
do
i
draw?
justice

i'm
talking
about
the
opinions...
the
majority--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--does
not
mention
the
federal
points--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--which
were
called
to
their
attention
by
the
minority.

so
certainly,
they
read
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
didn't
find
it
persuasive,
why
should
i
find
it
persuasive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
is
that
the
majority
did
not
rule
on
the
fourth
amendment
point
as
such,
they
cited
state
cases.
the
minority
cited
the
fourth
amendment
and
federal
cases.
justice

so,
the
state,
the
majority
knew
about
that,
and
did
not
mention
it.
what
conclusion
do
i
draw
from
that
as
to
the
majority
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
were
the
traps
doing
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
they
didn't
fish,
but
what
were
they
doing
with
traps?
