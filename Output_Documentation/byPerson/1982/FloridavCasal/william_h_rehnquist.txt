justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
mccormick,
supposing
that
a
state
custom
agent,
state
marine
officer,
has
legally
boarded
the
boat
and
there
isn't
just
a
standoff
between
the
captain
or
whoever
it
is.
the
captain
realizes
the
officer
is
there
and
walks
to
the
wheelhouse
and
goes
to
the
wheelhouse
himself.
do
you
think
that
when
the
state
police
officer
comes
from
the
outside
part
of
the
boat
to
the
inside
part
of
the
boat
he
has
to
ask
permission
if
the
captain
has
simply
gone
on
ahead,
indicating
for
him
to
follow?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
the
record
indicate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
from
your
description
of
how
she
got
to
the
wheelhouse,
it
sounds
as
though
she
had
followed
the
captain
there.
not
that
she
pushed
the
captain
over
to
one
side
and
went
into
the
wheelhouse
on
her
own.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why,
again,
do
you
say
it
was
unlawful?
because
they
didn't
prepare
something
like
a
certificate
of
arrest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
saying
there
was
no
offense
for
which--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
didn't
the
supreme
court
of
florida
disagree
with
you
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
unlikely
to
prevail,
whatever
you
may
be
able
to
advance,
on
an
argument
that
says
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
misunderstood
what
the
florida
police
could
arrest
for,
or
what
was
legally
required
to
be
onboard
under
florida
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
happened
last
year,
mr.
mccormick?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
florida
changed
its
constitution?
