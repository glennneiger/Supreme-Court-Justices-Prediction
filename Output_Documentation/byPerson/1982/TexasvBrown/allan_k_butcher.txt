mr.
allan
k.
butcher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
respondent's
position
that
we'd
like
to
review.
the
first
is
the
one
that
mr.
marshall
just
left
off
on,
and
that
is
it
is
respectfully
suggested
that
this
case
is
not
ripe
and
should
be
sent
back
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
clarification
as
to
exactly
what
was
the
basis
of
their
decision.
was
it
in
fact
article
i,
section
9
of
the
texas
constitution,
or
was
it
in
fact
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution?
secondly,
the
respondent
would
state
that
if
the
court
does
reach
the
search
issue,
an
analysis
of
the
case
shows
it
to
be
consistent
with
the
federal
rules
in
the
cases
dealing
with
the
plain
view
seizures.
looking
at
the
first
issue,
that
is,
the
independent
state
grounds,
respondent
would
say
that
this
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
case.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
the
only
mention
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
where
the
court
reprints
the
respondent's
motion
to
suppress.
the
motion
to
suppress
cites
as
a
basis
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
and
article
i,
section
9
of
the
constitution.
those
two
are
juxtaposed.
they
are
next
to
one
another
in
the
respondent's
motion.
other
than
that,
the
words
"fourth
amendment"
or
"united
states
constitution"
do
not
appear
in
the
brief.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
no,
sir,
it's
not.
it's
found
at
556
southwest
second
796.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
556
southwest
second
796.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
no,
ma'am,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
it's
interesting
that
at
least
one
judge
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
does
now
share
that
view,
though.
in
an
opinion
that
was
handed
down
in
1982,
just
last
year,
granted
it's
a
dissenting
opinion
in
synder
v.
the
state,
judge
tiegg,
marvin
tiegg,
wrote
that
he
felt
that
texas
and
the
texas
constitution
affords
individuals
more
protection
than
does
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
no,
he
didn't.
he
goes
on
to
say,
however,
that
his
construction...
well,
this
is
a
direct
quote...
"this
construction
is
in
keeping
with
the
traditions
of
individuality,
privacy
and
personal
liberty
which
have
marked
the
history
of
our
state.
"
so
at
least
one
justice...
judge
is
thinking
along
those
lines.
also,
judge
roberts,
who,
of
course,
recently
retired,
has
noted
several
times
in
opinions
the
use
of
article
i,
section
9,
but
he
has
never
suggested
that
it's
a
different
standard
or
really
expounded
on
it
as
justice
tiegg
or
judge
tiegg
did.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
i
don't
think
so,
sir,
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
so
is
that
coolidge
is
cited.
coolidge
is
the
only
federal
case
that's
cited
in
that
opinion.
and
then
they
go
on
to
show
four
texas
cases
that
have
built
upon--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--well,
it's
certainly
not
clear,
just
as
i
would
suggest
the
entire
opinion
is
not
clear
as
to
what
is
the
basis.
it
could
have
been
article...
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
could
just
as
easily
have
been
article
i,
section
9,
because
the
citing
of
coolidge
can
be
viewed
as
merely
a
jumping
off
point.
in
other
words,
it's
well
recognized
that
states
can
develop
their
own
standards
for
searches
and
seizures
so
long
as
they
don't
fall
below
the
minimum
standards
provided
by
the
fourth
amendment.
those
minimum
standards,
it
might
be
imagined,
are
set
out
in
coolidge,
and
using
coolidge
as
a
starting
place,
they
then
build
a
texas
standard,
and
shown
in
the
cases
that
are
cited:
duncan,
howard,
deloa
and
so
forth.
it's
not
clear--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--yes,
it
would.
in
fact,
that's
exactly
what
the
respondent
asks:
send
the
thing...
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
ask
them
what
was
the
basis.
to
do
otherwise
we
think
is...
invites...
invites
basically
an
advisory
opinion
on
the
part
of
this
court.
if
this
court
hands
down
a
decision
and
decides
against
the
respondent,
it
will
go
back
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
no,
i
wouldn't,
because
this
is
not
a
belton
case.
the--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--no,
it's
not
a
traffic
arrest,
your
honor.
the
arrest
was
not
a
traffic
arrest.
the
stop
was
a
traffic
stop,
but
the
arrest
was
the
arrest
on
controlled
substance.
if
the
court--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--well,
the--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--that's
true,
if
there
was
a
valid
arrest
that
preceded
that.
but--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--a
look
at
the
record
shows
that
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
the
record...
i
understand,
and
i
have
no
good
answer
for
you.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
generally
not.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
you
don't
even--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--your
honor,
you
don't
even
have
to
assume
that.
that's
explicit
in
the
record.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
on
page
28,
for
example,
officer
maples
testified...
the
question
by
mr.
bankston:
"then
the
arrest
of
clifford
james
brown
that
night
was
based
on
your
suspicion
the
balloon
contained
a
controlled
substance,
is
that
correct?
"
"yes,
sir.
"
"that's
correct.
"
in
fact,
not
only
is
it
on
page
28,
but
you'll
also
find
it
explicitly
stated
that
the
arrest
was
based
on
seeing
the
balloon,
at
pages
28,
31,
25
and
27.
the
arrest
was
for
the...
when
he
saw
the
balloon.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
no,
ma'am,
they
didn't.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
that's
correct.
as
far
as
we
know...
mr.
carter
and
i
were
both
trial
counsel...
as
far
as
we
know,
the
balloon
was
not
opened
until
it
got
to
the
crime
lab
where
it
was
analyzed
by
the
chemist.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
perhaps
at
the
same
time
as.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
he
saw
the
balloon.
the
balloon...
when
he...
the
balloon
fell
as
he
exited
the
car.
he
reached
in,
picked
up
the
balloon,
and
the
arrest
was
made
at
that
time.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
it's
conceivable.
under
texas
law,
of
course,
a
custodial
arrest
can
result
from
a
failure
to
produce
a
valid
driver's
license.
as
a
matter
of
practice,
of
course,
usually
only
a
warning
or
a
ticket
at
most
is
given.
i
don't
think
that
that
note
in
the
opinion
squares
with
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
that's
correct.
but
the
problem
again
comes
back
to
the
point
that
the
arrest
was
based
on
the...
on
the
sight
of
the
balloon,
and
there
was
no...
my
memory
is
that
there
was
no--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--could
have
but
didn't.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
and
they
could
have
given
him
a
ticket.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
that
is
correct.
looking
at
the
independent
state
grounds,
i
would
reiterate
that
it's
just
not
clear
as
to
what
the
basis
of
the
court's
opinion.
there
are
instances
where
the
texas
constitution
and
texas
law
holds
the
government
activity
to
a
higher
standard
than
the
federal
rules.
there
are
a
number
of
places
in
the
texas
constitution
that
provide
more
protection,
broader
protections
than
do
federal
law
or
constitution.
for
example,
right
by
trial
by
jury
under
the
sixth
amendment,
of
course,
is
available
to
anyone
charged
with
a
criminal
activity
so
long
as
it's
not
of
a
minor
matter,
that
is,
involving
six
months
or
less
incarceration.
in
texas
under
the
constitution
you've
got
an
absolute
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
any
criminal
matter.
so
if
you've
got
an
overtime
parking
ticket
in
texas,
you
can
have
a
jury
trial
on
it.
the
use
of
oral
confessions
in
the
fifth
amendment
is
much
more
restricted
under
article
3822
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure.
there
are
a
number
of
instances
where
texas
has
chosen
to
have
broader
protections,
and
we
don't
know
that
this
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
in
our
brief
we
have
cited
a
statute,
article
1.06
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure
is...
is
a
prohibition
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
we
did
not
raise
that
in
our
motion
to
suppress,
and
it
was
not
raised
at
trial.
and
under
texas
law,
of
course,
any
appeal,
any
argument
has
got
to
comport
with
what
was
done
at
the
trial
level.
i
included
that
just
to
show
that
there
was
machinery
there
provided
by
the
texas
legislature
dealing
with
exactly
that.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
in
my
next
case
i'm
certainly
going
to
include
that.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
we--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--well,
it's
true
if
it
gave
rise
to
probable
cause.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes.
but
we
would
argue
that
even
if
you
do
apply
the
idea
of
probable
cause
to
these
facts,
you
still
have
got
an
impermissible
search.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
the
reason
is
that
in
the
record
you
don't
have
specific
articulated
rationales
as
to
why
this
officer
thought
he
had
evidence
of
a
crime
before
him.
he,
under
coolidge--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--he
could
have
had
probable
cause.
he
may
have
had
probable
cause,
but
he
didn't
say
it.
it's
not
in
the
record.
in
other
words,
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--i'm
saying
that
the
court--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--no.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
in
order
for
the
court
to
hand
down
a
decision
and
make
an
intelligent
judgment
on
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause,
there
has
got
to
be
evidence
as
to
the
probable
cause.
there
has
got
to
be
evidence
that
that
officer
knew
something.
his
specialized
education,
training,
experience
and
so
forth
alerted
him
to
the
fact
that
an
otherwise
innocent
object,
this
party
balloon--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--well,
that's...
i
think
a
close
reading
of
the
record
doesn't
really
show
that.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
i
understand,
sir.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
his
experience
is
not
clear;
and
that's
really
the
key
issue.
if
he
said
i
know
that
in
that
locale
it
is
common
for
heroin
to
be
carried
in
balloons,
there
would
be
no
question.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
looked
at
what
he
recited
and
found
it
insufficient.
he
didn't
really
articulate.
he
didn't
show
that
he
had
special...
the
specialized
knowledge,
the
wherewithal
to
know
that,
as
i
said
before,
an
innocent
party
balloon
was
in
fact
evidence
of
crime.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
but
they
were--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--yes.
that
would
certainly
arouse
suspicion.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes,
he
did.
that
is
correct.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
he
needs
to
specify
it.
he
needs
to
lay
it
out.
he
has
to
inform
the
court
as
to
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
his
decision.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
the
trial
court
found
that
the
object
was...
they
upheld
the--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--well,
that's
implicit.
they
just
overruled
our
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
there
wasn't
probable
cause
demonstrated
in
that
courtroom
that
day.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
write
out
exceptions
to
the
charge?
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
no,
sir.
that's
not
necessary.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
you
do
have...
well,
you
do
have
to
have
an
objection.
the
objection
has
got
to
be--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--yes,
sir,
we
did.
we
did
object.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
excuse
me.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you.
we
objected
to
the
search.
we
did
not
object
to
the
opening
of
the
balloon.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
that's
correct.
but--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--no,
he
doesn't.
and
that's--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--no,
he
doesn't.
and
that's
where
we
take
exception
with
the
state.
we
agree
that
probable
cause
is
a
proper
standard.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
state...
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
subsequent
to
brown...
in
fact,
in
boyd
v.
the
state,
a
september
1981
case...
looked
at
this
question
of
what
does
"know"
mean
when
they
say
the
officer
must
know
he's
got
evidence
of
a
crime
before
him.
in
that
case
it
involved
the
police
officer
observing
that
defendant
exchanging
a
tinfoil
bindle,
a
tinfoil
packet
for
money.
to
a
layman
the
exchange
of
a
tinfoil
packet
for
money
would
be
a
routine
matter,
certainly
not
evidence
of
a
crime.
that,
however,
was
not
the
evidence.
in
that
case
the
officer
testified
he
was
aware
that
in
that
locale
heroin
normally
is
kept
in
tinfoil
bindles.
thus,
the
court
held
that
the
officer's
specialized
knowledge
gave
meaning
and
a
basis
for
his
conclusion
that
he
had
evidence
of
a
crime
before
him.
that
search
was
upheld,
the
conviction
was
upheld,
and
brown
was
cited
with
approval.
so
they
don't
mean
absolute
certainty.
they
mean
that
he
has
to
have
knowledge
that
otherwise
innocent
items
are
in
fact
evidence
of
a
crime.
this
case
is
very
narrow,
in
my
view.
the
holding
of
the
court
below
just
says
that...
just
takes
the
texas
standard,
which
they
develop
there,
requiring
the
officer
to
articulate
why
he
knew
he
had
evidence
of
a
crime
before
him
and
extends
that
to
opaque
party
balloons...
otherwise
innocent
items.
there's
no
doubt
that
an
officer
walking
down
the
street
and
seeing
a
handgun
on
the
seat
of
a
parked
car
immediately
knows
he
has
evidence
of
crime
before
him.
but
if
it's
an
innocent
item,
something
that
not
on
its
face
is
contraband,
inherently
dangerous,
et
cetera,
then
the
officer
has
got
to
say
why.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes,
sir,
there
is.
it's
illegal
to
have
a
handgun
in
your
automobile
in
texas.
so
as
soon
as
he
saw
it,
he
knew
it.
but
if
he
sees
a
party
balloon,
just
as
if
he
sees
a
brown
translucent
bottle,
as
in
one
of
the
cases
noted
here,
just
as
if
he
sees
a
photographic
negative
on
the
table.
the
case
nicholas
v.
the
state
cited
by
the
court
involved
an
officer
making
an
arrest
of
an
individual
who
is
wanted
in
another
city.
the
officers
walk
in.
there
is
some
negatives
on
the
table.
they
pick
them
up,
have
to
hold
them
to
the
light.
once
they
hold
them
to
the
light
they
see
that
it
shows
that
defendant
engaged
in
sexual
activity
with
a
child.
a
criminal
proceeding
results
from
that.
was
the
negative
evidence
of
a
crime?
yes,
it
was.
was
the
officer
lawfully
where
he
was?
yes.
did
he
inadvertently
come
across
it?
but
did
he
know
that
the
negative
was
evidence
of
a
crime?
no,
he
didn't
until
he
picked
it
up,
held
it
to
the
light
and
saw
it.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
that's
right.
because
it
was
not
immediately
apparent
to
him.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
i--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--it
would
be
if
the
officer
had
said
that.
in
other
words,
the
officer
doesn't
clearly
state
that
he
knows
that
heroin
is
kept
in
balloons
or
that
any
controlled
substance
is
kept
in
balloons.
he
says
that
he
made
an
arrest
the
year
before
involving
a
balloon
and
heroin--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--but
he
didn't
give
any
rational
basis
for
why
he
believed
there
was
a
controlled
substance
in
there.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
well,
i
recognize
i'm
going
counter
to
the...
to
the...
to
the
opinions,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
officer...
the
officer
making
the
stop,
he's
the
one
who
has
to
recognize
that
he's
got
probable
cause
in
front
of
him.
after
the
fact
or
new
information
and
so
forth
i
don't
think
ought
to
reach
back
to
justify
the
seizure.
if
the
officer
at
the
time
of
the
incident--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--no,
sir.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
of
any
texas
cases
on
that
point.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes,
but
that
testimony
was
from
frank
shiller,
the
chemist.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
it
still
would
bother
my
sense
of
justice
if--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--you
will--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--that
the
officer
doing
the
act
did
not
have
the
probable
cause,
and
we
shouldn't
bootstrap
it
with
somebody
else's
knowledge.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
i
think
it
troubles
my
sense
of
justice.
well,
it's
a
close
call.
it's
a
close
call.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
yes.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
it's
not
clear.
they
cite
coolidge
as
a
jumping
off
point,
but...
and
that's
the
thing,
i
think,
that
needs
to
be
kept
in
mind.
coolidge
started...
coolidge
is
1971,
as
i
recall.
the
first
application
of
it
in
texas
was
nicholas,
and
that's
a
1973
case,
and
that
is
the
photographic
negative
case.
then
it
expands
to
1977
with
the
duncan
case
which
is
the
bottle,
the
brown
bottle,
et
cetera.
and
you
don't
find
any
other
federal
cases
cited.
you
will
always
find
coolidge,
then
nicholas,
then
duncan,
then
howard,
now
brown.
i
think
this
is
a
narrow
holding,
and
it
really
carries
forward
a
line
of
cases
that
i
just
recited,
and
just
applies
the
holdings
of
those
cases...
duncan,
howard,
et
al.,
to
a
specialized
set
of
circumstances;
that
is,
green
balloons
in
this
case.
there
is
a
red
balloon
case,
deloa
v.
the
state,
a
1977
one,
where
again
the
officer
making
an
arrest
found
a
red
balloon
on
the
window
sill.
he
seized
it.
it
was
in
fact
heroin.
that
was
ruled
inadmissible,
again
because
the
officer
failed
to
articulate
a
rational
basis
for
his
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
he
had
evidence
of
a
crime
before
him.
so
this
is
not
the
first
balloon
case.
this
is
the
second
balloon
case.
you've
got
a
red
one
in
'77
and
then
one
now.
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
oh,
no.
no.
i'm
sorry.
i
did
not
communicate
effectively.
there
are
cases...
in
fact,
all
of
those...
duncan,
howard,
deloa,
and
nicholas
are
all
examples...
well,
nicholas
would
not,
but
the
others
are
examples.
for
example,
seeing
the--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--examples
of
incidents
where
you
had
an
innocent
item
there
that
did
in
fact
contain
a
controlled
substance,
but
the
officer
was
unable
to
articulate
a
rational
basis
for
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
he
had--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--yes.
now,
again--
mr.
allan
k.
butcher
--that's
correct.
thank
you.
