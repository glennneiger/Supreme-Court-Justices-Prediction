you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.

what
did
you
say
was
observed
in
the
glove
compartment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
firearms
discovered?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
referred
to
the
panel
having
considered
it
and
then
another
step
in
there.
was
belton
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
at
the
time
reconsideration
or
rehearing
was
sought?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
i
thought
you
said
there
was
some
effort
after
that
to
get
reconsideration
by
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ordinarily
isn't
an
inventory
process
something
that
occurs
after
the
vehicle
and
the
person
have
been
taken
to
the
police
headquarters?
you
don't
make
inventory...
inventories
out
on
the
street,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
doesn't
belton
take
care
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
mr.
butcher.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
did
say
here
at
the
top
of
page
31
in
answer
to
the
question,
"so
he
was
arrested
on
the
suspicion
that
the
green
balloon
that
you
found
on
him
contained
a
controlled
substance,
some
type
of
controlled
substance?
"
"yes".
now,
how
much
more
would
you
think
he
would
have
to
articulate
his
reasons?
and
he...
he
had
already
testified
that
he
had
prior
experience
seeing
narcotics
carried
in
just
this
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
said
it
in
all
but
the
words
you've
just
said
it
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
things
that
he
observed,
the
officer
observed
in
the
glove
department...
the
typical
utensils
of
the
narcotics
trade?
everything
but
a
syringe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
can't
he
add
these
things
up,
add
two
and
three
and
four
and
come
to
a
conclusion?
and
he
said
this
was
an
active
medium
drug
area.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
more...
what
more
does
he
need?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
doesn't
have
to
know
in
an
absolute
sense
that
it
is
heroin,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
not
a
chemist.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
isn't
the
balloon
just
like
the
tinfoil
package?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then,
what
did
he
mean...
i'll
read
that
question
to
you
again.
question:
"so
he
was
arrested
on
the
suspicion
that
the
green
balloon
that
you
found
contained
a
controlled
substance,
some
type
of
controlled
substance?
"
"yes,
sir".
how
could
he
say
it
more
plainly
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
trouble
your
sense
of
justice
or
your
sense
of
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
