justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
marshall,
could
i
ask
you,
when
was
the
decision
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you...
had
bolton
been
announced
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
make
of
this
statement
in
the...
in
the
court
of
appeals...
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion:
"we
do
not
here
question
either
the
validity
of
the
officer's
initial
stop
of
appellant's
vehicle
as
part
of
a
license
check
nor
the
propriety
of
the
arrest,
since
appellant
failed
to
produce
a
driver's
license.
"
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
say
they
do
not...
they
apparently
say
he
was
legally
arrested.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
was
legally...
if
he
was
legally
arrested
at
the
time,
what
kind
of
a
search
of
the
vehicle
would
have
been
authorized
under
bolton?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
belton,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
including...
including
the
balloons.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
we...
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case
if
he
was
legally
arrested?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
case
comes
here
to
us
with
the
texas
court
having
said
he
was
legally
arrested.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
to
find
facts.
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
belton
came
down
on
the
same
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
refer...
they
refer
to
the
fact
that
we
do
not
question
the
propriety
of
the
arrest
since
appellant
failed
to
produce
a
driver's
license.
that
sounds
like
it's
a
traffic
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
failure
to
produce
a
driver's
license
ever
an
occasion
for
a
custodial
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
after...
that's
after
you've
got
some
business
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
having
made
an
arrest,
which
requires
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
surplusage
isn't
it
really?
you
don't
mean
to
just
rely
on
plain
view,
if
that's
your
thesis.
you
just
say
any
time
you've
got
probable
cause
to
believe
a
container
has
contraband
in
it,
you
can
hold
it,
seize
it
and
hold
it
at
least
long
enough
to
get
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
you
really
need
to
say.
you
don't
need
to
talk
about
plain
view,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
belton
applies...
let's
suppose
that
i
stop
a...
well,
in
texas
an
officer
stops
a
person
for
speeding
and
gives
him
a
ticket.
and...
and
he
says
well,
i've
stopped
you
and
i'm
giving
you
a
ticket,
and
now
i'm
going
to
search
the
car
and
all
of
the
containers
in
it.
do
you
think
belton
permits
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
i
mean
would
just
giving
a
ticket
for
speeding
justify
the
search
of
the
entire
passenger
compartment
and
any
containers
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
say
a
custodial
arrest.
i
just
said
they
gave
him
a
ticket.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
stopped
him,
and
they
said
you
just
wait
here;
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
ticket,
and
also
i'm
going
to
search
your
interior
of
your
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
call
that
giving
him
a
ticket
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
called
whatever
happened
here
with
respect
to
the
driver's
license
an
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you...
assume
the
court
agreed
with
you
that
it
ought
to
go
back
for
that
purpose,
but
i
suppose
you
would
object
to
saying
to
reconsider
also
in
the
light
of
belton.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
assume
the...
that's
only
because
you
say
that
the
arrest
they
were
referring
to
was
a
traffic
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
asking...
referring
to
this
passage
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
just
saying
we
do
not
question
the
propriety
of
the
arrest
since
appellant
failed
to
produce
a
driver's
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was
an
arrest...
if
there
was
an
arrest
that
is
valid
under
state
law,
then
it
certainly
wouldn't
violate
the
federal
constitution
if
they
searched
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i'm...
i'm
just...
if
you...
if
you
suggest
we
ought
to
send
it
back
to
find
out
what
the
basis
of
their
judgment
was,
if
they
decided
that
it
was
a
federal
ground,
they
would
have
to
also...
i
would
like
to
know
what
they
meant
by
the
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could
have
arrested
him--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
heart
of
your
case,
though,
is
challenging
the
notion
that
viewing
this
tied
off
balloon
gave
probable
cause
to
believe
anything
except
that
it
was
a
tied
off
balloon;
because
if
it
did
give
probable
cause
to
believe
there
was
narcotics
in
the
balloon,
why,
he
could
have
been
arrested,
and
then
the
balloon
could
have
been
searched
on
the
spot.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
mean,
yeah.
that's
the
heart
of
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
saying
that
he
didn't
have
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
that's
a...
do
you
say
that
that
violates
the
federal...
the
fourth
amendment
if
there
was
actual
probable
cause
there
but
the
officer
didn't
know
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know.
you
don't
find
any
cases
like
that
around,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
said
he
did.
he
said
he
thought
so
based
on
his
experience.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
trial
court
find?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
they
upheld,
but
did
they
say
there
was
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
said
there
wasn't
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
the
balloon
had
heroin
in
it,
the
show
was
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
he
could
have
been
arrested
right
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
at...
suppose
at
the
suppression
hearing
the
officer
testified
exactly
like
this,
and
the
judge
said
well,
i
don't
think
you've
really
spelled
out
this...
why
you
thought
that
was...
so
the
prosecutor
says
well,
i'll
call
an
experienced
officer
and
have
him
testify.
and
the
officer
says
a
hundred
thousand
times
he's...
he
gives
all
the
explanation
anyone
could
possibly
give
which
would
indicate
that
at
the
time
in
fact
there
was
probable
cause
to
seize
the
balloon.
now,
would
you
say
that
it
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment
for
that
also
to
have
seized
it
without
being
able
to
testify
to
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you...
do
you...
do
you
have...
do
you
have
cases
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
got
cases
on
the
other
side,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
was
enough
in
this
case
that
the
fellow
who
examined
the...
who
did
the
forensic
examination,
he
said
how
many
drug
analyses
have
you
done?
he
says
thousands.
"and
do
you
find
it's
common
or
uncommon
to
discover
that
there's
controlled
substances
quite
frequently
housed
or
contained
in
balloons
such
as
this?
"
"yes.
"
"it's
quite
common.
"
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
