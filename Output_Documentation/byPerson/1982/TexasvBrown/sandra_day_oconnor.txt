mr.
marshall,
you
didn't
mention,
i
believe,
the
independent
state
ground
issue
in
your
discussion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
texas
law
be
any
different
than
the
federal
law
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
butcher,
can
you
cite
any
texas
case
that's
treated
article
i,
section
9
of
the
texas
constitution
any
differently
than
the
fourth
amendment?
yes,
ma'am,
i
can.
in
the
case
of
escamillia
v.
the
state,
a
1977
case,
it
involved
a
burglary
in
which
a
blood
test
was
involved.
the
defendant
in
that
cause
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
and
based
it
on
the
amendments
four,
five
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
article
i,
section
9
of
the
texas
constitution.
the
analysis
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
was
that
under
this
court's
ruling,
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
did
not
extend
to
the
blood
test.
further,
under
schmurber
v.
california,
the
defendant,
given
those
circumstances,
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
requirement
that
a
search
warrant
be
obtained
prior
to
getting
the
blood
test.
the
court
held
that
although
the
fourth
amendment
may
not
require
it,
article
i,
section
9
did.
is
that
case
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
aware
of
crowell
v.
state,
a
texas
criminal
court
of
appeals
case
which
stated
that
article
i,
section
9
of
the
constitution
of
texas
and
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
are
in
all
material
respects
the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
he
didn't
persuade
his
colleagues,
though.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
butcher,
did
the
respondent
challenge
below
the
opening
and
inspection
of
the
contents
of
the
balloon?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
the
seizure
of
the
balloon.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
seizure
technically
occurred
prior
to
the
arrest,
according
to
the
record,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
your
position?
same
time
as.
