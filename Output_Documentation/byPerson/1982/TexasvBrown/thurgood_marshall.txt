mr.
attorney
general,
if
i
can
go
back
a
little,
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
this
man
was
stopped
and
the
officer
asked
him
for
a
license,
and
he
reached
in
his
pocket
and
said
i
don't
have
a
license
but
i've
got
an
illegal
drug
and
a
dollar
bill?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
i
understood
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
he
was
going
to
bribe
the
officer
with
a
dollar?
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
according
to
you
he
never
did
have
a
driver's
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
he
wasn't
reaching
for
a
driver's
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
would
think
people
are
consciously
aware
of
what
they
have
and
what
they
don't
have
in
their
pockets.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
search
was
made
when
he
was
at
the
back
of
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
moved
to
the
back
of
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there
was
nothing
in
that
car
that
he
could
have
touched.
justice
thurgood
marshall
nothing
that
man
could
do
in
the
back
of
the
car.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
my
understanding
that
in
texas
anybody
with
a
balloon
is
subject
to
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
else
do
you
have
to
have
in
addition
to
the
balloon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't...
the
experience
he
has
in
balloons?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
interested
in
that.
i'm
just
interested
in
if
i
happen
to
be
in
texas
and
i
have
a
balloon
and
i'm
driving,
i'm
subject
to
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
was
all
by
himself,
wasn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let
me
ask
you,
have
you
ever
knotted
a
toy
balloon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
so.
you
didn't
consider
yourself
violating
the
law,
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
humorous
four
years?
it's
humorous?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
right.
mr.
butcher,
doesn't
the
appendix
show
that
they
took
him
out
of
the
car,
took
him
around
the
back
of
the
car,
"read
him
his
miranda
rights
and
arrested
him?
"
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
give
people
miranda
rights
on
traffic
violations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
don't
you
assume
that
he
was
arrested
on
the
major
charge--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--at
that
stage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--mr.
butcher,
getting
back
to
this
question
of
not
raising
the
point
of
opening
the
balloon,
is
it
still
true
in
texas
that
you
have
to
write
out
your
exceptions
during
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
to
the
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
do
have
to
make
exceptions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
just
left
it
there?
you
didn't
raise
it
on
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
raise
it
on
appeal.
