justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
theory
of
the
plain
view
doctrine?
let's
take
the
case
away
from
the
automobile
because
it
raises
belton
and
all
these
other
questions.
say
this
happened
in
an
airport,
and
the
man
had
been
asked
to
show
his
ticket.
he
reached
in
his
pocket,
and
he
pulled
out
by...
say
inadvertently
a
balloon
just
like
this
and
he
at
the
same
time
had
his
luggage
going
through
the
detector,
and
they
say
exactly
what
they
saw
here.
it
would
be
your
view
that
they
could
just
seize
the
balloon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
because
the
person
seeing
the
balloon
has
probable
cause
to
believe
its
contents
are
contraband?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
let
me
take
you
one
step
further.
say
they
saw
all
that,
and
then
he
put
it
back
in
the
suitcase
and
then
carried
it
down
the
way
toward
the
plane.
you
now
know
that
within
the
suitcase...
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
within
the
suitcase
there's
this
contraband.
would
you
have
the
power
to
seize
the
suitcase
and
open
it
because
it's
in
plain
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
here
did
they
also
open
the
balloon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
a
warrant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
couldn't
you
open
the
suitcase?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
exactly
the
point
of
my
question.
why
isn't
the
balloon
a
container?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
position
that
a
law
enforcement
officer
may
seize
a
container
whenever
the
container
is
in
plain
view
and
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
the
container
has
contraband
within
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wonder
if
this
is
really
a
plain
view
case.
you're
not
relying
on
the
balloon
itself
giving
you
an
adequate
basis;
you're
relying
on
these
other
circumstances...
what's
in
the
glove
compartment
and
all
that.
and
you
say
all
of
those
facts
add
up
to
probable
cause
to
arrest
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
you
say...
but
you're
really
not
saying
that
there
was
an
item
all
by
itself
in
plain
view
that
was
subject
to
seizure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's...
that's
exactly
what's
troubling
me.
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument...
it...
it's...
would
be
the
same
case
if
we
had
a
briefcase
in
an
airport
and
a
lot
of
extraneous
facts
that
give
you
probable
cause
to
believe
the
briefcase
has
something,
some
counterfeit
money
in
it.
your
view
is
that
that's
a
plain
view
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
you
can't
see
the
counterfeit
money,
and
here
you
can't
see
the
substance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
want
us
to
analyze
it
as
a
container
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but...
but
do
you
concede
that
it
was
wrong
to
take
a
look
inside
the
balloon
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
under
your
view,
the
plain
view
doctrine
applies
whenever
a
container
which
is
in
plain
view
is...
probably
contains
contraband.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
repeat
that,
please?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
explain
the
language
in
the
texas
court's
opinion
that
justice
white
called
your
attention
to
and
your
opponent's
attention:
the
arrest
is
not
questioned
since
appellant
failed
to
produce
a
driver's
license.
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
does
the
failure
to
produce
a
driver's
license
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
they
could
be
arrested
for
having
a
balloon?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
they
saying
that
even
though
the
officer
should
not
have
seized
the
balloon
and
could
not
rely
on
that
to
support
the
arrest,
nevertheless,
a
custodial
arrest
was
permissible
because
he
didn't
have
a
driver's
license?
is
that
what
they're
saying?
and
hence
you
could...
you
could
search
the
car.
and
then
you
could
go
ahead
and
do
everything.
assuming
that
this
is...
that
in
texas...
you're
telling
us
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
they
can
make
a
custodial
arrest
for
not
having
a
driver's
license.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
if
there's
a
legal
basis
for
the
arrest,
even
if
the
officer
acted
for
the
wrong
reason,
i
suppose
that
would
not
invalidate
the
arrest,
would
it?
i
mean
if
in
fact
he
didn't
have
the
driver's
license,
he's
subject
to
arrest,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
the
texas
court
treat
that
problem?
do
they
consider
it
significant
as
to
whether
the
officer
himself
had
knowledge?
i
mean
maybe
we
don't
require
it,
but
maybe
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
they
do.
or
you're
not
arguing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
question
about
your
texas
procedure.
the
opinion
ends
referring
to
the
negative
case
and
the
brown
bottle
case,
i
guess
it
was.
were
those...
those
are
both
texas
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
they
decided...
do
you
know
whether
they
were
decided
on
fourth
amendment
or
texas
grounds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
isn't
also
a
case.
you
said
there
weren't
any
cases
that
were
decided
on
the
ground
that
the
officer
was
unable
to
articulate
the
reasons
for
the
arrest.
now
you're
saying
that's
such
a
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
examples
of
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
is
it...
are
you
arguing...
i
sometimes
have
difficulty
being
sure
what
you're
arguing...
but
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
a
set
of
texas
cases
that
sets
aside
searches
on
the
ground
that
even
if
there
might
have
been
in
an
objective
sense
probable
cause,
it
was
nevertheless
bad
because
the
officer
could
not
testify
to
facts
that
prompted
him
to
do...
to
make
the
seizure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
that
may
be
a
different
rule
than
we
apply.
well,
those
three
cases
you
say,
though,
didn't
say...
didn't
say
that
objectively
there
might
have
been
probable
cause,
but
the
officer
just
didn't
articulate
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
can
arrest
a
person
on
probable
cause.
