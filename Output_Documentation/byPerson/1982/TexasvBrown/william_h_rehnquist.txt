justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
wonder...
excuse
me.
were
there
two
different
arrests
or
an
arrest
for
two
different
offenses,
one
a
traffic
offense
and
the
other
for
the
drug
offense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
doubt
as
to
which
arrest
the
texas
court
of
appeals
was
talking
about
in
its
opinion
when
it
says
we
don't
doubt
the
validity
of
the
arrest
are
they
talking
about
the
drug
arrest?
well,
they're
saying--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
if
you're
giving
somebody
a
ticket
there's
some...
there's
some
element
of
seizure,
isn't
there?
you
don't
let
a
person
simply
drive
away
when
the
officer
goes
up
and
says
look,
i'm
going
to
write
a
ticket
for
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
free
to
drive
away.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
butcher,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
opinion
of
those
judges...
judge
mccormick,
dowley,
davis...
dissenting
from
the
en
banc
hearing
proposition
treated
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
of
the
panel
as
a
federal
constitutional
case?
they
seemed
to
cite
principally
cases
from
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
asking
you
about
how
you
would
interpret
the
court
of
appeals
panel
opinion.
i'm
asking
you
how
you
would
characterize
the
dissenting
opinion's
treatment
of
the
court
of
appeals
panel
opinion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
would
be
very
easy
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
it
clear.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
last
instance
you
mentioned...
i
think
it
was
about
oral
confessions...
you
referred
to
a
texas
statutory
provision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
that
would
be
apparent
if
the
court
were
relying
on
a
statutory
provision.
they
would
at
least
cite
the
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
in
your
next
case
you
can
raise
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
all
of
our
cases
saying
that
there
was
probable
cause
are
based
on
testimony
in
the
trial
record
that
an
officer
said
yes,
i
saw
this
thing,
and
i
immediately
thought
it
should
be
seized
because
there
was
reasonable
grounds
to
think...
a
lot
of
probable
cause
holdings
of
this
and
other
courts
are
just
common
sense
statements
by
judges
that
if
an
officer
saw
this,
he'd
certainly
have
basis
to
seize
or
search.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
an
officer
know
in
the
case
of
a
handgun
that's
placed
on
the
car...
is
there
a
law
against
carrying
handguns
in
texas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
held
that
that
negative
was
not
seizable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
although
if
it
had
been
a
print
in
the
same
place,
it
would
have
been
seizable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see
what
you
mean
about
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
having
a
different
doctrine
than
the
federal
constitution.
how
do
you
distinguish?
you
described
this
little
process
of
the
tinfoil
package
that
the
officer
said
he
was
accustomed
to
seeing
as
the
mode
of
delivering
drugs.
how
is
that
essentially
different
from
this
case
where
he
said
he
had
had
experience,
prior
experience
with
drugs,
granulated
substances
inside
of
a
toy
balloon?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
first
is
texas
against
brown,
a
case
which
began
in
a
texas
state
court
when
a
police
officer
stopped
a
passing
car
and
asked
the
driver
for
his
driver's
license.
while
the
driver
brown
was
looking
for
the
license,
the
police
officer
involves
saw
him
drop
a
small
green
party
balloon,
knotted
near
the
tip
under
the
front
seat.
the
officer
could
also
see
the
car's
glove
compartment
containing
assortment
of
vials,
and
loose
white
powder.
the
officer
concluded
that
brown
was
probably
carrying
drugs
and
seized
the
balloon.
the
chemical
test
of
the
balloon
later
showed
that
it
contained
heroin
and
brown
was
charged
with
state
law
drug
violation.
the
texas
courts
however,
held
the
balloon
had
been
seized
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
united
states
constitution.
and
that
it
could
not
be
used
as
evidence
against
brown.
today
we
reverse
that
decision
with
all
nine
members
of
the
court
deciding
that
the
plain-view
doctrine
permitted
seizure
of
the
balloon
in
this
case.
the
line
up
is
as
follows:i
have
filed
an
opinion
joined
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
white,
and
justice
o'connor.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
powell
joined
by
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
stevens
joined
by
justices
brennan
and
marshall
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
