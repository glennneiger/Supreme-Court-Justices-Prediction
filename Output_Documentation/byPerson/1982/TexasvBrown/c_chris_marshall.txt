mr.
c.
chris
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
directed
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas.
in
1979
respondent
clifford
james
brown
was
charged
with
a
second
degree
felony
offense
under
state
law
of
possession
of
a
controlled
substance.
this
charge
stemmed
from
an
incident
in
which
respondent
was
found
in
possession
of
a
tied-off
balloon
containing
heroin.
respondent
moved
to
suppress
the
heroin
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
the
product
of
an
illegal
warrantless
seizure,
and
after
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
trial
court,
the
motion
to
suppress
was
denied.
respondent
then
entered
a
plea
of
nolo
contendre
to
the
charge,
reserving
under
state
procedures
his
right
to
appeal
the
seizure
question;
and
he
was
sentenced
to
four
years'
imprisonment.
on
appeal
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
reversed
the
conviction,
holding
that
this
warrantless
seizure
of
the
knotted
balloon
violated
the
plain
view
doctrine
as
announced
in
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire.
the
theory
below
was
that
for
the
contraband
nature
of
that
balloon
to
have
been
"immediately
apparent"
to
the
officer
as
required
by
coolidge,
the
officer
had
to
know
what
was
inside
the
balloon.
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
because
this
balloon
was
opaque,
the
officer
obviously
could
not
see
inside
the
balloon
and
could
not
have
known
what
was
inside.
therefore,
they
found
the
seizure
to
be
improper.
the
state
of
texas
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
or
a
request
for
rehearing,
but
that
motion
for
leave
to
file
was
denied
by
the
en
banc
court,
three
of
those
nine
judges
filing
a
written
dissent
to
that.
it
was
the
belief
of
these
dissenters
that
probable
cause,
not
knowledge,
was
the
standard
to
which
the
seizing
officer
was
held,
and
that
when
proper
regard
was
given
to
the
inferences
that
this
experienced
officer
was
able
to
draw
when
he
saw
the
balloon,
probable
cause
was
evident,
and
the
seizure
was
proper.
to
amplify
on
the
facts
of
the
seizure,
on
june
18th,
1979,
fort
worth
police
officer
tom
maples
and
other
members
of
the
patrol
division
had
set
up
a
roadblock-type
of
driver's
license
check.
they
were
checking,
stopping
each
vehicle
that
came
through
this
roadblock,
checking
the
drivers
for
driver's
licenses
and
checking
the
vehicles
for
expired
inspection
stickers
or
registration
and
license
plate
violations.
they
were
not
checking
the
drivers
for
outstanding
warrants.
they
were
not
looking
for
any
particular
individual.
they
did
not
have
any
members
of
the
narcotics
detail
with
them.
it
happened
to
be
officer
maples
who
stopped
respondent's
vehicle
when
he
came
through
this
checkpoint.
when
officer
maples
asked
the
respondent
to
exhibit
a
driver's
license,
the
respondent
reached
in
his
right
front
pants
pocket,
fumbled
around
in
that
pocket
long
enough
to
alarm
the
officer,
and
caused
him
to
shine
his
flashlight
into
the
car,
this
incident
having
occurred
around
11:00
to
11:15
at
night,
and
when
the
respondent
withdrew
his
hand
from
that
pants
pocket,
the
officer
could
see
him
holding
two
items.
between
his
thumb
and
index
finger
he
was
holding
a
folded
dollar
bill,
but
between
his
two
middle
fingers
where
i've
placed
this
box,
he
was
holding
a
small,
green,
knotted,
opaque,
tied-off
balloon.
the
officer
described
it
as
being
tied
about
a
half
inch
from
the
end,
and
when
mashed
down
it
was
approximately
one-eight
of
an
inch
thick.
the
officer
then
saw
the
respondent
drop
this
balloon
alongside
his
leg
onto
the
car
seat.
the
respondent
reached
over
and
opened
the
glove
box
of
the
vehicle,
presumably
still
trying
to
find
the
driver's
license.
the
light
in
that
box
came
on,
and
inside
there
the
officer
could
see
several
items.
he
saw
what
he
described
as
a
lot
of
loose
white
powder,
a
bag
of
balloons
apparently
just
as
they
had
come
from
the
store,
several
small,
empty
plastic
vials.
the
officer,
having
been
experienced
in
this
sort
of
thing,
formed
the
conclusion
that
there
was
some
sort
of
narcotic
substance
in
that
green
balloon
he
had
first
seen,
so
he
asked
the
respondent
to
step
from
the
car
and
move
to
the
rear
of
the
vehicle,
which
respondent
did
closing
the
door
behind
him.
the
officer
could
then
see
inside
the
vehicle
still,
saw
the
green
balloon
on
the
car
seat
where
the
respondent
dropped
it,
and
he
reached
in
and
picked
up
the
balloon,
noticing
at
that
time
that
it
contained
some
sort
of
powdery
substance
inside.
the
record
also
shows
that
this
officer
was
a
five-year
veteran
of
the
police
department.
he
had
taken
part
in
several
arrests
where
such
balloons
had
been
seized
and
found
to
contain
narcotics.
he
had
made
one
such
arrest
himself
in
the
previous
year
in
which
eight
or
nine
such
balloons
had
been
recovered.
he
had
talked
with
his
fellow
officers
about
the
fact
that
narcotics
were
often
packaged
this
way.
he
had
talked
with
drug
users
about
the
use
of
milk
sugar,
which
is
apparently
what
this
loose
powder
was.
he
knew
from
his
experience
what
those
empty
plastic
vials
could
have
been
put
to.
and
it
was
based
on
this,
the
circumstances
of
seeing
this
balloon
and
his
experience
with
the
narcotics
trade,
that
caused
him
to
believe
the
balloon
contained
narcotics,
caused
him
to
seize
it,
and
caused
him
then
to
place
respondent
under
arrest
for
possession
of
a
controlled
substance.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
three
classes
of
items,
your
honor.
several
empty
plastic
vials...
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
pill
bottles
or
test
tube
type
of
vials...
a
bag
of
balloons,
apparently
a
bag
just
as
they
had
come
from
the
store...
these
balloons
were
empty...
and
he
also
saw
the
balloons,
empty
plastic
vials
and
loose
white
powder.
now,
at
that
time
in
the
record
the
officer
didn't
further
describe
this
powder,
but
after
the
arrest
he
conducted
an
inventory
of
the
vehicle,
found
a
bottle
of
milk
sugar
in
the
back
seat,
and
given
the
record,
it
appears
that
milk
sugar
was
also
what
this
loose
white
powder
was.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
additional
powder
was
itself
a
controlled
substance.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
no,
your
honor.
there
was
some
marijuana
also
found
in
the
back
seat,
but
no
firearms.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
it
was
in
the
spring
of
1981.
the
panel
decision
was
on
march
31st.
we
filed
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
for
rehearing,
which
under
local
practice
is
accompanied
by
the
motion
itself.
that
was
denied
on
july
1st,
1981.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
my
recollection
is
that
it
may
have
been
announced
on
the
very
same
day,
on
july
1st.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
i
believe
what
they
were
talking
about
there
is
what
i
would
refer
to
in
a
moment
as
the
so-called
prior
lawful
intrusion
aspect
of
the
plain
view
doctrine.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--well,
certainly
under
new
york
v.
belton,
a
search
of
the
entire--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--the
entire
passenger
compartment.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
i
believe
the
facts
didn't
develop
that
way,
at
least
the
way
the
testimony
was
developed.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
officer's
testimony
was...
and,
of
course,
there
is
always
that
dispute
about
when
the
formal
arrest
occurred...
was
that
he
did
not
place
the
respondent
under
arrest.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
i
realize
that.
i'm
just
saying
that
i...
as
i
understood
what
they
were
saying
is
that...
and
from
the
record...
the
arrest
was
not
thought
to
have
occurred
until
after
the
balloon
had
been
seized.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
another
thing,
if
i
could
clarify
this,
this
respondent
has--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--this
respondent
has
never
raised,
nor
did
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
address
the
actual
search
inside
the
balloon
but
merely
the
seizure
of
it,
which
i
believe
took
place
when
the
officer
reached
inside
the
car
and
when
he
determined
that
there
was
some
powder
in
the
balloon.
according
to
the
officer's
testimony,
the
arrest
only
occurred
i
suppose
seconds
later
when
he
now
had
decided,
the
officer
had
decided
this
must
contain
some
sort
of
narcotics
in
it,
and
told
the
respondent
he
was
under
arrest
for
possession
of
a
controlled
substance.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
the
officer
did
testify
that
he
issued
a
ticket
for
no
operator's
license,
the
respondent
never
having
produced
one.
and
it
wasn't
developed
in
the
record
whether
he
considered
that
to
be
the
basis
of
a
custodial
arrest.
that
wouldn't--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--that
is
certainly
what
i
thought,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
as
i
say,
i
know
they
said
that,
and
i
think
they
also
were
saying
when
they
don't
question
the
stop
that
they
were
assuming
under
delaware
v.
prouse,
the
initial
stop
of
the
vehicle
was
proper.
the
case
was
litigated
by
the
defense
at
the
trial
court
level
on
whether
the
seizure
of
the
balloon
was
valid
under
the
plain
view
doctrine.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
under
our
state
law
it
would
be
possible
to
make
a
custodial
arrest
for
that.
i
don't
think
it
would
normally
be
the
practice
by
any
means,
but
it
certainly
would
be
possible.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
no,
your
honor,
it
wouldn't
have
been,
because
as
i
said,
my
recollection
is
belton
was
decided
either
on
the
same
day
or
one
day
after
the
court
of
criminal
appeals--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--yes,
your
honor.
i
filed
a
state's
motion
for
rehearing,
but
at
the
time
i
filed
that
belton
had
not
been
decided.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
when
they
declined
to
hear
the
case,
under
state
procedures
we
had
no
ability
to
make
a
second
motion
for
rehearing.
and
again,
as
i
say,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decided
this
under
the
plain
view
doctrine.
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
points
i
had
wanted
to
make
later
is
that
given
a
slightly
different
timing,
a
slightly
different
approach
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
perhaps
this
seizure
could
have
been
justified
under
belton,
even
under
ross,
or
perhaps
under
south
dakota
v.
opperman
as
an
inventory
of
the
vehicle,
which
probably
was
going
to
have
taken
place.
we
think
that
underscores
the
anomalous
nature
of
this
decision
and
shows
what
a
disadvantage
law
enforcement
officers
are
put
to
in
the
state
of
texas
because
of
the
view
of
the
plain
view
doctrine
established
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
there
is
some
testimony
about
this
in
our
record
indicating
that
fort
worth
officers
make
an
initial
quick
inventory
and
fill
out
what
they
called
a
record
sheet.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
that
is
what
he
brought
out
of
his
pocket,
your
honor.
and
i
suppose--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--i
suppose
it's
an
equal
inference
from
the
record
whether
he
was
trying
to
get
the
balloon
out
of
his
pocket
because
he
was
afraid
the
officer
might
come
across
it,
or
if
it
was
just
sheer
bad
luck
on
his
part
that
it
became
wedged
in
his
hand
when
he
may
have
legitimately
been
looking
for
a
license.
perhaps
he
thought
this
dollar
bill
was
his
license,
and
the
balloon
just
accidentally
on
his
part
became
wedged
between
his
fingers.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
i
think
perhaps
since
it
was
described
as
a
folded
dollar
bill,
he
might
have
felt
that
in
his
pocket
and
thought
that
was
a
driver's
license
he
was
about
to
drag
out
of
his
pocket
and
not
a
folded
dollar
bill.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
no,
your
honor,
he
never
produced
one.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
assuming
he
was
consciously
aware
that
he
didn't
have
one,
i
think
that
would
be
true.
i
don't
know.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
i
would
think
most
of
the
time,
but
i
can't
read
the
mind
of
this
respondent.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes,
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
the
issue
we
see
in
this
case
gives
this--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--your
honor,
i
think
they
would
have
the
power
to
seize
the
suitcase.
our
position
is
that
this
phrase
in
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire
about
the
contraband
nature
of
the
item
being
immediately
apparent
means
probable
cause.
and
so
in
your
example
i
think
they
could
seize
the
suitcase.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
at
some
point
they
certainly
did
analyze--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--yes,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
the
only
reason
i
hesitate
there
is
because
of
the...
this
court's
so-called
container
cases...
chadwick
and
sanders.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
your
honor,
it
may
be.
i'm
not
positive.
it
may
be.
but
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
the
only
question
the
respondent
has
ever
brought
up
is
the
seizure
of
the
balloon--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--not
the
opening
of
it.
that's...
it's
a
very
narrow
case
in
that
sense.
he
never
brought
that
issue
up.
in
fact,
the
trial
court--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--yes,
sir.
that
would
be
our--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--yes,
sir.
as
i
say,
coolidge
v.
new
hampshire
talks
about
immediately
apparent
contraband
seizable
evidence.
and
the
problem
we
see
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
opinion
is
that
they
said
officer
maples
had
to
know
what
was
inside.
we
think
the
standard
was
probable
cause.
i
don't
think
there's
any
issue
here
on
the
so-called
prior
intrusion
or
the
inadvertent
discovery.
and
the
only
clarification
and
correction
there
we
seek
is
that
"immediately
apparent"
means
"probable
cause".
we
think
that
is
supported
by
many
of
this
court's
cases,
although
obviously
never
exactly
answered.
warden
v.
hayden
speaks
in
terms
of
probable
cause
to
seize
an
item.
colorado
v.
bannister,
a
pro
curiam
opinion
only
one
term
ago,
talked
about
seizing
items
in
an
automobile
because
the
officer
when
he
saw
these
lug
nuts
and
wrenches
in
the
car
recognized
them
as
meeting
the
description
of
property
that
was
stolen
and
which
he
had
just
received
a
broadcast
about.
this
court
said
because
he
had
probable
cause
to
seize
them,
he
could
do
so
without
a
warrant.
we
think
that's
exactly
the
situation
here.
again,
i
take
no
position,
and
i
personally
obviously
don't
know
what
the
answer
would
be
if
this
were
a
matter
of
going
inside
the
balloon.
but
we
don't
even
know
for
sure
in
this
record--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--well,
i
think
they
would
have
had
to
have
had
probable
cause
to
think
it
was
in
fact
seizable.
i
think
belton,
had
it
applied,
had
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
thought
the
arrest
had
already
occurred,
would
have
allowed
the
officers
to
search
the
vehicle,
presumably
to
retain
any
item--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--well,
i
suppose
that
brings
up
kind
of
an
interesting
problem
again
as
was
alluded
to
earlier:
what
did
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
mean
by
the
arrest.
if
they
thought
it
related
to
the
no
operator's
license
violation,
again,
that
might
have
gotten
them
in
the
car,
but
presumably
they
would
have
had
probable
cause
to
seize
it.
if
they
thought
it
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
a
drug
violation,
then
we
have
the
curious
result
that
although
they
had
probable
cause
to
arrest,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
thought
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
to
seize.
again,
i
can
see
all
the
questions.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
the
seizure
of
the
balloon
was,
yes,
your
honor.
again,
i--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
no.
in
fact,
the
officer
was
clear
that
he
didn't
fear
for
his
safety
or
the
destruction
of
those
items.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
no,
your
honor.
another
problem
we
see--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--well,
we
think
you
have
to
have
probable
cause,
and
it's--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--pardon
me?
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
in
this
case
the
unusual
nature
in
which
this
balloon
was
brought
out
of
his
pocket
and,
in
our
view,
discreetly
or
surreptitiously
dropped
along
his
pants
leg
onto
the
car
set;
the
distinctive
knotted
nature
of
this
balloon
which
the
officer
said
he
associated
with
narcotics;
and
then
what
we
think
are
obvious
narcotics
packaging
items
in
the
glove
box...
the
milk
sugar,
the
powder,
the
plastic
vials,
the
bag
of
balloons.
and
we
think,
as
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
in
u.s.
v.
cortez
made
clear,
probable
cause
to
detain,
to
seize
has
to
be
evaluated
based
on
all
the
circumstances
which
the
officer
sees,
and
including
the
experience
he
has
and
the
inferences
he
can
draw
based
on
that.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
that
is
one
thing,
your
honor.
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
of
what
he
associated
with
balloons,
and
yet
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
give
it
no
legal
weight.
it's
not
even
mentioned
in
their
opinion.
we
think
that
standing
by
itself
is
error
under
cortez.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
on
the
facts
that
you've
stated
that
would
be
true.
again,
we
say
it's
all
the
circumstances.
i
would
think,
for
example,
an
individual
all
by
himself,
one
balloon,
probably
inflated--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--well,
all
by
himself
in
terms
of
another
person,
but
not
all
by
himself
in
terms
of
narcotics
packaging
paraphernalia
in
the
glove
box.
we're
not
saying
that
this
is
a
case
where
a
police
officer
goes
up
to
a
children's
birthday
party
and
starts
arresting
every
child
with
a
balloon
in
his
hand.
but
this
is
an
unusual
balloon...
knotted
a
half-inch
from
its
tip,
all
this
material
in
the
glove
box.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
i
have.
i
don't--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--no,
sir.
i
haven't
have
heroin
inside
those
balloons
either.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
and
i
didn't
have
all
the
other
items
in
the
glove
box.
i
didn't
try
to
drop
it
alongside
my
pants
leg
when
the
officer
was
asking
me
for
a
license.
i
realize
in
some
sense
this
is
almost
a
humorous
case
because
at
least
in
our
view--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--humorous
on
the
facts
of
this
seizure,
that
it
seems,
in
our
view,
which
we
hope
will
prevail
but
which,
of
course,
is
a
matter
for
the
court
to
decide,
that
this
was
so
clearly
probable
cause;
and
yet,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
the
officer
had
to
know
what
was
inside
the
balloon,
says
nothing
about
the
officer's
testimony
concerning
his
experience
with
this
very
type
of
balloon,
everything
else.
it
just
seems
to
us
to
be
clear
error.
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
held
the
officer
to
a
higher
standard
under
the
plain
view
doctrine
than
any
decisions
of
this
court
seem
to
indicate.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
i
suppose
this
balloon
in
context
is
an
item
that's
subject
to
seizure.
i
almost
hate
to
raise
it
because
it
again
brings
up
another
question
that's
not
exactly
raised
here,
but
that
would
this
court's
again
container
cases,
chadwick
and
sanders.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
to
the
extent--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--the
reason
i
don't
want
it
analyzed
as
a
container
case
or
don't
think
it
should
be
is
because
the
container
cases,
chadwick
and
sanders
and
at
least
whatever
dicta
is
left
in
robbins,
are
ones
dealing
with
the
entry
inside
the
container,
not
the
seizure
of
it.
because
as
i
understand
those
cases,
all
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
the
seizure
of
that
container
would
have
been
permissible
on
probable
cause.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
no,
i
don't.
i
don't--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--concede
that.
it's
just
not
raised.
it
never
has
been
raised
by
the
defendant.
the
record
doesn't
even
indicate
for
sure,
for
certain
when
the
balloon
was
opened.
i
know
in
my
brief
i
said
when
the
police
chemist
opened
it,
and
after
reading
that
over
i
realized
that
was
an
unconscious
assumption
on
my
part.
the
record
is
clear
that
officer
maples
did
not
open
it
on
the
scene,
but
beyond
that,
neither
side
developed
when
it
was
opened.
and
therefore,
it's
the
mere
seizure
of
this
balloon
is
what's
at
issue
here.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
as
far
as
the
mere
seizure
of
the
container
is
concerned,
i
believe
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
i
know
this
court
has--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--well,
i
know
there
is
even
to
me
some
indication
in
this
court's
cases
whether
plain
view
is
an
independent
basis,
or
if
your
honor's
suggestion
would
completely
cover
the
waterfront,
so
to
speak.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
again,
had
this
case
been
litigated
differently,
the
facts
turned
out
slightly
differently,
had
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
approached
it
from
a
different
manner,
it
possibly
on
these
precise
facts
could
have
been
held...
could
have
been
decided
as
a
search
incident
to
arrest
where
the...
you
search
the
interior
of
the
vehicle
when
you
arrest
the
occupants.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
not
belton.
i
believe
belton
would
be
limited
to
the
passenger
compartment.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
the
way
belton
sits
right
now
i
would
say
so,
assuming
a
custodial
arrest
were
made
for
the
speeding
and
it's
transported
to
the
station.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
well,
i'm
sorry
then,
justice
white.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
then
i
don't
think
merely
giving
a
ticket
would
authorize
a
belton
type
of
search
of
the
vehicle.
i
certainly
don't.
it
would
have
to
be
a
custodial
arrest
and
not
just--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--i
don't
believe
so,
at
least
not
in
the
sense--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--apparently
so.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes,
your
honor.
that--
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
--that,
of
course,
is
why
i
was
hesitating.
i
know
there
is
something
in
the
nature
of
a
seizure.
whether
it's
the
type
of
arrest
that
invokes
belton
is
what
i'm
not
sure
of.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
very
well.
let
me
mention
that
very
briefly
as
opposed
to
on
rebuttal.
the
defense
has
conceded
that
probable
cause
is
a
standard,
but
instead
says,
or
to
get
around
that
says
this
was
decided
on
state
law
grounds.
the
problem
i
see
with
that
position
is
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
at
the
outset
cited
to
and
quoted
from
coolidge
as
the
controlling
authority
under
the
plain
view
doctrine.
it
did
not
cite
to
state
law
anywhere
in
its
discussion
of
the
merits,
and
we
think
under
oregon
v.
hass,
delaware
v.
prouse,
and
most
recently
oregon
v.
kennedy,
the
citation
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
absence
of
citation
to
state
law
clearly
showed
that
this
was
not
really
based
on
state
law
grounds.
whether
it
could
have
been,
which
is
what
the
respondent
actually
says,
i
don't
know,
but
in
this
case
it
simply
was
not
based
on
state
law.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
i
am
not
aware
of
any
decision
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
that
has
ever
announced
any
special
state
law
plain
view
doctrine.
so
as
far
as
i
know,
the
answer
to
that
would
be
no,
your
honor.
if
i
could
reserve.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
have
time
to
make
just
a
couple
of
points.
first,
i
think
respondent
is
attributing
to
the
state
court
a
finding
it
didn't
make;
that
is,
something
about
articulating
the
basis
for
probable
cause.
my
recollection
is
that
simpson
v.
state,
which
is
cited
in
judge
mccormick's
dissent
below,
will
make
clear
that
texas
has
always
looked
to
the
objective
facts,
not
to
the
officer's
subjective
state
of
mind
to
look
to
probable
cause.
i'd
also
say
that
i
believe
it's
true,
as
justice
white
says,
that
this
case
could
be
decided
in
the
state's
favor
without
mentioning
the
plain
view
doctrine,
because
cases
such
as
chadwick,
sanders,
and
g.m.
leasing
seem
to
indicate
that
the
mere
seizure
of
an
item
can
be
based
on
probable
cause
as
opposed
to
what
might
need
to
be
shown
for
the
search
of
it.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
certainly.
under
u.s.
v.
watson,
you
can
arrest
on
probable
cause.
however,
this
could
be
seen
as
a
plain
view
case
in
the
sense
that
the
officer
did
view
these
items
in
the
car
without
having
to
make
any
search,
any
rummaging
of
the
car;
and
to
that
extent
it
can
be
seen
as
a
plain
view
case,
though
again
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
that
could
be
said
of
most...
said
to
be
true
of
most
any
plain
view
case.
the
point
we
want
to
make
is
that
we
don't
believe
the
plain
view
doctrine,
which
is
what
the
texas
court
relied
on,
should
be
a
restriction
on
the
state's
activities,
on
the
police
officer's
authority.
we
believe
that
probable
cause
is
a
standard,
and
that's
what
should
have
been
applied
here.
mr.
c.
chris
marshall
i
was
going
to
say
something
about
that.
i
believe,
although
i
don't
have
the
case
with
me
because
it
hadn't
been
cited
before,
that
shephardizing
escamillia
would
show
that
it
has
now
been
overruled
because
of
a
recent
amendment
to
the
texas
search
warrant
statute
in
chapter
18
of
our
code
of
criminal
procedure.
and
i
think
that
decision
there
was
based
not
on
state
constitutional
law,
but
on
the
specific
search
warrant
statute
we
had.
and
i
think
in
general
our
article
i,
section
9
is
co-extensive
with
the
fourth
amendment.
i
know
article
i,
section
10
has
recently,
a
month
ago,
been
held
to
be
co-extensive
with
the
fifth
amendment.
that
was
in
a
case
called
ex
parte
shorthaus
just
published
at
640
southwest
second
924.
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
case
where
under
state
constitutional
law
we
have
found
any
special
state
law
plain
view
doctrine
or
any
state
law
unusual
or
peculiar
notion
of
probable
cause.
and
again
on
this
state
law
ground
question,
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
every
state
case
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
cited
here...
nicholas,
duncan,
deloa...
each
one
of
those
the
court
will
find
expressly
relies
on
coolidge.
in
fact,
in
howard
v.
state
the
panel
opinion
in
that
case
says,
"following
the
teachings"
of
coolidge.
we'd
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
and
render
judgment
in
favor
of
the
state
of
texas.
