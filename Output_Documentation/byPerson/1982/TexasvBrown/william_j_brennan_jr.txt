well,
then,
i
suppose...
how
would
you
explain
their
setting
aside
the
conviction
if
they
had
found
he
was
legally
arrested?
because
they
thought
at
that
time
that
the
search
of
the
balloon
was
invalid,
even
if
he
was
legally
arrested.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
without
regard
to
belton,
if
there
was
probable
cause,
as
your
court
of
criminal
appeals
said,
and
the
propriety
of
the
arrest,
that
was
on
probable
cause,
could
they
not
have...
couldn't
the
officers
have
seized
the
balloon
without
regard
to
what
its
contents
were?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i...
i...
i...
i
just
wonder
without
regard
to
belton.
if
there
was
probable
cause
for
arrest
in
these
circumstances
would
there
not
have
been...
would
not
the
seizure
of
the
balloon
have
been
proper
as
incident
to
the
arrest?
