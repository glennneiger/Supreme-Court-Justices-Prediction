mr.
gallagher,
why
do
you
think
the
congress
in
1871
did
not
include
the
equal
protection
language
in
the
first
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
assure
constitutionality
in
its
application
to
the
states,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
explain,
mr.
hing,
what
happened?
these
incidents
occurred.
then
the
complaint
was
amended
in
the
federal
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
include
this
allegation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
then
how
did
the
state
cause
of
action
develop,
and
did
the
state
cause
of
action
include
this
same
allegation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
included
this
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
fact
you
may
never,
notwithstanding
what
we
do,
is
that
right?
