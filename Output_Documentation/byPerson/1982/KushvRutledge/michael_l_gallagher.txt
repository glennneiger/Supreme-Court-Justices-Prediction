mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
turns
on
your
determination
of
the
breadth
of
the
first
clause
of
42
u.s.c.
section
1985(2),
a
reconstruction
era
civil
rights
statute.
the
case
arises
from
the
alleged
mistreatment
of
a
white
college
football
player
by
his
coaches.
respondent
kevin
rutledge
attended
arizona
state
university
in
1977
and
1978
and
played
intercollegiate
football.
the
petitioners
are
frank
kush,
his
former
coach,
two
assistant
coaches,
and
arizona
state
university's
former
athletic
director.
after
mr.
rutledge
left
arizona
state
university
and
transferred
to
the
university
of
nevada
at
las
vegas,
he
filed
a
claim
with
the
arizona
board
of
regents
reciting
a
veritable
chamber
of
horrors
to
which
he
had
been
exposed
while
a
student
athlete
at
arizona
state.
the
filing
of
that
claim
was
a
statutory
prerequisite
to
the
initiation
of
a
lawsuit
in
arizona
against
a
state
agency
such
as
the
arizona
board
of
regents.
that
claim
was
denied
by
arizona
and
mr.
rutledge's
federal
court
lawsuit
followed.
one
of
his
claims
in
the
federal
suit
was
that
mr.
kush
and
others
had
conspired
to
intimidate
witnesses
in
violation
of
14
u.s.c.
section
1985(2).
the
district
court
dismissed
the
entire
lawsuit
as
to
all
defendants.
on
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
as
pertinent
here,
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
mr.
rutledge
had
stated
a
claim
under
the
first
clause
of
1985(2)
and
specifically
held
that
there
was
no
requirement
for
invidiously
discriminatory
class-based
animus
in
such
an
action.
this
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
aligned
it
with
the
third
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
which
previously
had
ruled
the
same
way.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
justice
rehnquist,
this
complaint
in
this
lawsuit
alleges
that
from
the
time
mr.
rutledge
filed
his
claim
against
the
arizona
state
university
board
of
regents,
which
was
prior
to
the
initiation
of
any
suit,
and
continuing
the
conspiracy
supposedly
went
on.
initially,
there
was
no
claim
pending.
as
it
turned
out,
mr.
rutledge
filed
his
case
in
federal
court
and
shortly
thereafter
filed
virtually
the
same
case
in
state
court,
presumably
to
protect
his
one-year
statute
of
limitations
under
1983.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
no,
justice
rehnquist.
however,
the
state
court
case
did.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
my
understanding
of
what
the
ninth
circuit
found
in
that
regard,
justice
rehnquist,
was
that
the
language
in
the
complaint,
the
continuing
language,
if
you
would,
if
you
will,
suggested
that
there
was
intimidation
of
witnesses
going
on
after
the
federal
court
case
had
been
filed.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
well,
that
raises
the
next
question,
justice
rehnquist,
as
to
how
broad
1985(1)
as
to
what
is
a
pending
action.
there
have
been
discussions
as
to
what
"attending
court"
means
in
that
situation.
but
the
ninth
circuit
said,
while
it
was
a
close
question,
it
did
state
a
claim
and
that
it
should
be
remanded,
and
specifically
suggested
that
the
district
court
ask
mr.
rutledge
to
file
an
amended
complaint
setting
forth
in
specificity
the
specific
acts
he
claimed
gave
rise
to
his
cause
of
action.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
there
have
not
been,
justice
rehnquist.
as
i
was
pointing
out,
the
circuits
have
split
on
the
question
of
a
requirement
for
invidiously
discriminatory
class-based
animus
in
a
1985,
section
2,
clause
1
case.
generally
speaking,
1985(2)
deals
with
conspiracies
which
interfere
with
the
judicial
process.
the
language
consists
of
two
clauses
separated
by
a
semicolon.
the
first
clause
prohibits
conspiracies
to
deter
by
force,
intimidation
or
threat
parties
or
witnesses
in
the
federal
court
processes.
the
language
which
follows
the
semicolon,
the
second
clause,
prohibits
conspiracies
to
impede,
hinder,
obstruct
or
defeat
due
course
of
justice
in
any
state
or
territory
with
the
intent
to
deny
any
citizen
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
it
is
the
petitioners'
position
that
a
cause
of
action
under
either
clause
of
1985(2)
requires
a
finding
of
invidiously
discriminatory
class-based
animus.
there
seems
to
be
no
question
today
but
that
that
is
a
co-requirement
under
second
clause
or
state
action
lawsuits.
that
seems
to
be
the
teaching
of
griffin
versus
breckenridge,
1971,
and
all
five
circuits
who
have
directly
dealt
with
the
question
of
1985
have
not
had
any
problem
realizing
that
second
clause
lawsuits
have
to
be
based
on
invidiously
discriminatory
class-based
animus
because
of
the
equal
protection
language.
the
diversity
of
opinion
and
the
problem
arises
because
the
first
clause
simply
does
not
have
equal
protection
language.
we
believe
that
the
analysis
of
this
court
in
griffin
versus
breckenridge
applies
with
equal
vigor
to
the
case
at
bar
and
that
there
should
be
a
finding
that
invidiously
discriminatory
class-based
animus
is
a
requirement
under
either
clause
of
1985(2).
in
griffin
this
court
did
not
engage
in
a
hypertechnical
dissection
of
the
syntax
of
the
language,
but
instead
took
a
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
depth,
with
an
eye
towards
the
realities
of
what
was
going
on
in
this
country
in
1871
when
the
42nd
congress
enacted
the
ku
klux
klan
act,
which
of
course
is
the
original
act
on
which
both
1985(3)
and
1985(2)
are
based.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
i
think,
your
honor,
that
they
were
not
thinking
about
federal
courts
as
much
as
they
were
thinking
about
state
courts.
and
there
were
not
as
many
federal
courts
then.
the
limitation
on
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
was
much
less.
i
do
not
think
they
needed
it
for
a
constitutional
nexus
because
under
article
i,
section
8
or
elsewhere,
obviously,
there
is
no
problem
there.
it
is
very
difficult,
justice
o'connor,
to
discern
what
that
congress
had
in
mind
100
years
ago.
there
is
a
little
something
in
the
legislative
history
for
everyone.
and
as
this
court
expressed
in
navatny,
construction,
statutory
construction
in
these
civil
war,
post-civil
war
era
reconstruction
statutes
have
given
lots
of
difficulty
to
statutory
construction
problems.
there
was
already
a
criminal
statute
in
place,
justice
o'connor,
and
it
had
been
in
place
for
40
some
odd
years
at
the
time,
governing
people
that
would
attempt
to
impede
witnesses
in
federal
court.
i
don't
know
why
the
language
was
not
specifically
included
here.
i
believe
it
was
included
and
sprinkled
throughout
the
act
because
of
the
problems
congress
had--
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
--i
would
agree
with
that,
yes,
justice
o'connor.
and
it
wasn't...
there
was
no
constitutional
problem
with
this
particular
law.
as
this
court
recognized
in
griffin,
1985(2)
was
initially
a
criminal
statute,
but
the
broad
sweep
of
the
language
caused
the
amendatory
process
to
go
into
gear
and
ultimately
the
civil
remedies
provided
by
1985(3)
were
added
to
the
act.
as
you
said
in
griffin
versus
breckenridge,
and
it's
equally
applicable
here,
the
overwhelming
concern
as
expressed
by
the
heated
lengthy
debates
at
the
time
was
with
the
animus
or
the
intent
required.
that's
where
all
the
discussion
centered.
i
might
point
out
that
you
also
said
in
griffin
versus
breckenridge
that
that
was
the
type
of
case,
involving
three
mississippi
blacks
that
had
had
their
constitutional
rights
impaired
because
they'd
apparently
been
associated
with
somebody
someone
thought
was
a
civil
rights
worker,
was
the
type
of
case
that
went
to
the
core
of
what
1985
had
in
mind.
this
case
sub
judice
is
a
far
cry
from
that.
the
country
faced
a
number
of
problems
in
1871...
political,
economic,
social.
it
was
not
the
intent
of
the
42nd
congress
to
solve
every
ill
of
the
times
by
enacting
the
ku
klux
klan
act
back
then.
their
overwhelming
concern
was
with
the
attempted
disenfranchisement
of
the
newly
freed
slaves.
they
were
particularly
concerned
with
the
dangers
presented
by
the
hooded
conspirators
grouping
together
to
deprive
these
newest
citizens
of
their
federal
constitutional
rights.
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
federal
courts
were
somehow
pulled
out
and
examined
to
see
if
added
protection
was
needed
for
the
federal
courts.
it
seems
reasonable
that
what
happened
in
connection
with
the
federal
courts
is
that
congress
intended
to
provide
them
protection
from
the
civil
upheaval
being
caused
by
the
ku
klux
klan
activities
of
the
time,
and
there
simply
was
no
independent
consideration
given.
it
is
abundantly
clear
that
the
problem
congress
was
responding
to
was
racially
and
otherwise
motivated
by
ku
klux
klan
activity.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
were
already
ample
criminal
statutes
on
hand,
they
were
not
attempting...
and
such
statutes,
of
course,
have
never
been
construed
by
this
court
to
create
private
causes
of
action,
and
the
42nd
congress
was
not
attempting
to
do
that
with
1985(2).
they
were
concerned
with
interference
in
the
federal
process,
and
for
that
matter
the
state
process.
but
it
was
only
interference,
we
respectfully
submit,
which
was
grounded
on
invidiously
discriminatory
class-based
animus.
extending
the
coverage
of
1985(2)
past
the
point
ever
intended
by
the
congress
that
enacted
it
will
in
truth
and
in
fact,
we
submit,
not
do
one
thing
to
advance
the
cause
of
justice.
there
are
today
sufficient
criminal
statutes
on
the
books
to
act
as
a
chilling
effect
or
a
deterring
effect
to
people
who
would
interfere
with
the
process.
furthermore,
the
underlying
activity,
the
force,
the
coercion,
the
threats,
are
ordinarily
going
to
be
able
to
be
compensated
for
under
state
tort
action.
lastly,
in
any
event
the
respondent
here
is
not
a
proper
party
to
maintain
this
action.
this
statute,
unlike
1985(3),
does
not
talk
in
terms
of
indirect
suffering.
it
talks
about
direct
action.
admittedly,
the
only
court
that
we
were
able
to
discern
which
has
ever
addressed
this
proposition
is
a
district
court
in
maryland
in
1978,
but
the
holding
was
clear
and
the
holding
was
sound,
and
that
was
that
a
party
does
not
have
a
cause
of
action
for
interference
with
his
witnesses.
one
further
indicia
of
this
is
the
fact
that
1985(2),
first
clause,
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
after
the
fact
retaliation
or
retribution.
it
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
a
juror
or
a
witness
who
has
already
testified
or
already
rendered
his
verdict
and
is
later
harassed,
intimidated
or
threatened.
that
would
indicate
that
someone
with
standing
such
as
respondent
here,
a
party,
who
is
not
himself
intimidated,
would
have
no
complaint
after
the
verdict
had
been
entered
or
after
a
witness
had
already
testified.
and
because
of
the
narrow
issue,
as
we
see
it,
presented
to
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
surely,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
i
don't
think,
in
all
candor,
we
can
go
far
enough,
justice
white,
to
claim
that
they
are
all
barred,
because
in
truth
and
in
fact
a
lot
of
the
underlying
facts
were
presented
to
a
jury.
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
a
jury
heard--
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
--they
could
have
been
had
the
state
court
judge
presumably
not
dismissed
the
1985(2)
count
on,
number
one,
the
ground
it
was
barred
by
res
judicata,
and
number
two
that
it
failed
to
state
a
claim.
that
did
not...
the
civil
rights
actions
were
dismissed.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
yes,
and
the
state
action
had
gone
to
verdict
by
the
time
the
ninth
circuit
remanded,
and
there
have
been
no
further--
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
--i
think
it
may
well,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
well,
there's
no
indication,
of
course,
what
the
district
court's
going
to
do.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
thank
you.
mr.
michael
l.
gallagher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
very,
very
briefly:
a
lot
of
conversation
here
has
left
the
record.
i
would
only
say
that
i've
heard
it
all
before,
four
months
in
trial
in
a
state
court
proceeding.
those
are
the
same
allegations
that
resulted
in
a
defense
verdict
for
mr.
kush
of
any
wrongdoing,
and
i
think
the
court
needs
to
know
that
having
heard
all
of
the
allegations.
the
only
other
point
i
would
make
is
that,
while
the
forty-second
congress
in
1871
clearly
could
have
made
a
law
with
the
expanded
interpretation
as
sought
by
the
respondents
here
and
as
found
by
the
ninth
circuit,
we
respectfully
maintain
that
it
did
not
do
so
in
1985(2).
thank
you.
