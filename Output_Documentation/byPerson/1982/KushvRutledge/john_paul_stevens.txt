justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
involves
the
construction
of
a
provision
of
the
civil
rights
laws
that
was
enacted
in
1871
and
a
statute
commonly
known
as
the
ku
klux
klan
act.
the
provision
in
question
prohibits
the
intimidation
of
witnesses
in
a
federal
judicial
proceeding.
the
question
is
whether
that
provision
only
applies
to
a
case
in
which
the
conspiracy
is
motivated
by
an
animus
toward
a
specific
class
such
as
a
racial
class
or
does
it
apply
to
all
federal
proceedings.
there
was
a
conflict
among
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
question
which
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
and
today
we
hold
that
the
provision
applies
broadly
to
all
federal
proceedings
and
for
that
reason,
in
a
unanimous
opinion
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
