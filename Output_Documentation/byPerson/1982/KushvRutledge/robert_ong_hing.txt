mr.
robert
ong
hing
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
rehnquist...
oh,
justice
rehnquist
isn't
here
right
now.
with
respect
to
the
timing
of
the
amended
complaint,
this
amended
complaint
was
filed
after
the
original
complaint,
and
the
allegation
is
complained
in
the
amended
complaint
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
intimidate
witnesses.
and
this
actually
occurred
from
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
claim
itself,
but
did
occur
between
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
original
complaint
and
the
amended
complaint.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
no,
justice
rehnquist.
this
action
was
filed
originally
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
the
federal
court
proceeding.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
your
honor,
let
me
explain
factually
how
this
occurred,
which
i
think
would
shed
some
light
on
it.
one
of
the
principle
allegations
in
the
complaint,
in
the
amended
complaint,
was
that
the
defendant
kush,
subsequent
to
a
football
game
that
occurred
up
in
seattle,
washington,
and
after
the
defendant
had
shanked
a
punt
and
come
off
the
field,
the
defendant
kush
punched
kevin
rutledge,
on
the
sidelines.
this
was
an
allegation
in
the
complaint.
as
it
turned
out,
several
of
the
players
had
witnessed
that
incident,
and
when
we
filed
the
complaint
in
the
federal
court
the
defendants
did
several
things
to
intimidate
witnesses.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
yes,
mr.
rehnquist,
i
believe
it
does,
because
at
the
point
that
the
action
was
filed
we
immediately
noticed
depositions.
in
fact,
we
noticed
some
20
depositions.
and
it
was
with
respect
to
those
individuals
who
were
being
deposed
or
who
were
being
noticed
for
depositions
that
some
of
this
intimidation
occurred.
meetings
were
held
with
the
football
players
at
which
the
coach
announced:
well,
fellows,
there's
nothing
to
all
of
this,
so
just
ignore
it.
in
the
meantime,
as
it
developed,
several
of
the
players
who
were
sitting
at
this
meeting
said
to
themselves:
well,
gee,
we
saw
this,
and
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
we
had
situations
where
at
the
training
table
the
players
were
called
in
and
asked:
please
sign
cards
as
to
whether
you
saw
anything
happen
up
in
seattle,
washington.
and
the
players
of
course
all
signed
cards:
i
did
not
see
frank
kush
punch
kevin
rutledge.
and
some
of
them
even
went
to
the
extent
of
handing
the
cards
to
the
assistant
coaches,
saying:
well,
tell
kush
that
he
owes
me
one.
and
we
had
other
incidents
where
two
of
the
players,
or
rather
the--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--and
included
the--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--allegation
under
section
1985.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
what
happened,
justice
o'connor,
was
that
the
federal
action
was
subsequently
dismissed
in
its
entirety
by
the
federal
district
court
on
the
ground
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
any
of
the
parties
based
on
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
appealed
that
decision,
but
pending
the
appeal,
because
of
statute
of
limitations
problems
and
not
wanting
to
take
the
risk
of
having
the
statute
run
on
us,
we
of
course
filed
an
action
in
the
state
court
after
the
federal
action
was
dismissed.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
we
did
include
the
1985
claim.
however,
the
trial
court
in
the
state
court
dismissed
the
1985
claim
on
the
grounds
that
the
federal
court
had
already
dismissed
that
claim.
and
therefore
we
have
never
had
a
day
in
court
on
the
1985
claim.
so
regardless
of
what
happens--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--well,
justice
o'connor,
my
assumption
is
that
we
will
have
a
day
in
court
on
not
only
the
1985
claim,
but
depending
on
what
happens
on
the
appeal
in
the
state
court
action
we
may
very
well
have
a
day
in
court
in
the
federal
court
on
all
of
the
claims,
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
plaintiff
made
a
decision
long
ago
that
he
wanted
to
try
this
case
in
the
federal
court,
and
for
very
good
reasons,
and
that
is
that
there
was
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
defendant
locally.
he
was
taking
on
a
hero,
an
idol
of
the
community.
and
it
got
so
serious
that
the
plaintiff's
life
was
threatened,
his
family's
life
was
threatened,
his
attorney's
life
was
threatened.
so
he
wanted
to
have
this
case
tried
in
the
federal
court.
and
if
the
state
court
of
appeals
reverses
and
sends
the
case
back
for
a
new
trial,
then
obviously
at
that
point
the
plaintiff-respondent
would
have
the
choice
of
determining
whether
he
wants
the
case
retried
on
the
merits
in
the
federal
court
or
the
state
court.
now,
kevin
rutledge
in
his
amended
complaint
alleged
that
the
defendants
have
conspired
to
prevent
by
intimidation
and
threat
various
material
witnesses
from
freely,
fully
and
truthfully
testifying
as
to
matters
raised
in
the
within
complaint.
42
u.s.
code
section
1985(2),
the
first
portion,
gives
the
injured
party
a
damage
action
against
those
who
have
conspired
to
deter
by
force,
intimidation
or
threat
any
party
or
witness
from
testifying
in
any
matter
pending
in
any
federal
court.
i
think
the
point
that
counsel
made,
that
kevin
rutledge
is
not
the
injured
party,
certainly
is
not
supported
by
the
statute,
because
the
portion
of
section
1985
which
creates
the
private
action,
which
is
contained
in
the
latter
part
of
subsection
(3)--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--yes.
the
complaint
is
part
of
the
appendix,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
it
is
part
of
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
but
the
enabling
or
the
section
of
the
statute
which
creates
the
private
rights
says
the
party
so
injured
or
deprived
may
have
an
action
for
the
recovery
of
damage
occasioned
by
such
injury
or
deprivation
against
any
one
or
more
of
the
conspirators.
so
i
would
assume
that
a
party
who
brings
an
action
and
who
has
all
of
his
witnesses
intimidated
to
such
an
extent
that
he
can't
produce
his
witnesses
is
in
fact
the
injured
party,
and
i
think
that
it
would
strain
statutory
construction
to
construe
otherwise.
furthermore,
section
1985(2),
first
portion,
does
not
require
that
the
plaintiff
be
the
subject
of
racial
or
class-based
invidiously
discriminatory
animus.
the
significant
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
first
portion
of
section
1985(2)
prohibits
conduct
which
forms
the
basis
for
the
claim
which
is
a
serious
interference
with
the
judicial
process
itself.
so
that
the
question
really
is
whether
congress
gave
the
federal
courts
the
jurisdiction
to
hear
private
damage
actions
without
regard
to
class-based
discriminatory
animus
where
the
action
is
based
on
interference
with
the
judicial
processes
of
the
federal
courts
themselves.
we
suggest
that
congress
clearly
did.
first,
the
language
of
the
statute
supports
this
interpretation.
second,
legislative
history
supports
this
interpretation.
third,
common
sense
and
logic
compels
this
interpretation.
there
is
also
no
question
that
congress
had
the
power
to
so
legislate.
now,
a
close
reading
of
section
1985
shows
that
it
had
basically
four
parts
or
four
prohibited
acts
in
the
first
portion
of
the
statute
prior
to
the
semicolon.
in
the
first
instance,
they
prohibited
the
threatening
of
parties
or
witnesses
who
were
about
to
testify
in
the
federal
court.
the
second
item
was
a
prohibition
against
doing
injury
to
a
party
or
witness
who
had
already
testified
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
your
honor,
that
is.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
i
do
not
believe
so.
but
in
this
case,
under
this
statute
the
congress
made
it
a
private
right
of
action.
in
other
words,
the
argument
that
this
was
already
covered
by
the
criminal
statutes
does
not
mean
that
it
cannot
also
be
covered
by
a
civil
statute
giving
the
injured
party
a
damage
claim,
and
that
is
precisely
what
is
done
in
section
1985(2).
the
third
item
which
the
first
part
of
section
1985(2)
prohibits
is
that
you
cannot
attempt
to
influence
the
verdict
of
a
juror
or
influence
a
juror.
and
the
fourth
item
is
that
you
cannot
injure
a
juror
after
he
has
assented
to
a
verdict.
so
the
first
part
of
section
1985(2)
covers
all
of
those
four
items,
the
first
two
having
to
do
with
witnesses
either
before
or
after
testifying
and
the
second
two
having
to
do
with
jurors
either
before
or
after
participating
in
a
verdict.
and
then
after
the
semicolon,
the
two
items
which
are
prohibited
involve
obstructing
justice
with
intent
to
deny
any
citizen
equal
protection
of
the
law.
but
it
says
"obstructing
justice
in
any
state
or
territory.
"
"so
as
soon
as
you
get
past
the
semicolon
congress
is
talking
about
actions
in
a
state
or
territory,
not
in
the
federal
court,
as
it
was
prior
to
the
semicolon.
"
then
the
second
item
which
is
covered
after
the
semicolon
is
action
to
injure
a
person
who
is
attempting
to
enforce
his
right
to
equal
protection,
and
that
also
presumably
would
be
in
a
state.
so
i
think
clearly
congress
delineated
what
the
limits
were
or
what
the
conditions
were
with
respect
to
the
restricted
or
the
proscribed
acts
before
the
semicolon
and
after
the
semicolon.
there
is
absolutely
no
equal
protection
language
before
the
semicolon.
each
one
of
the
proscribed
acts
relates
to
protection
of
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process
itself.
and
after
the
semicolon
they
don't
talk
about
federal
courts;
they
now
talk
about
acts
in
the
state,
and
you
have
broad,
sweeping
language
with
equal
protection
requirements.
so
the
statutory
language
itself
is
quite
clear,
even
without
regard
to
exploring
the
legislative
intent.
now,
legislative
intent
in
many
instances,
or
rather
in
most
instances,
is
rather
difficult
to
determine,
but
i
think
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
with
respect
to
legislative
intent
in
this
instance.
congress
was
concerned
about
restoration
of
federal
courts
after
the
civil
war.
they
wanted
to
protect
the
functioning
of
the
federal
courts.
there
was
serious
question
as
to
whether
state
courts
were
either
willing
or
able
to
protect
the
rights
of
all
citizens.
and
the
debates
on
the
legislation
show
very
clearly
that
where
congress
was
legislating
with
respect
to
any
matter
which
affected
an
officer
or
agency
of
the
federal
government
they
saw
no
necessity
to
insert
equal
protection
language.
however,
in
other
areas
involving
conspiracies
having
no
direct
impact
on
either
a
federal
officer
or
a
federal
agency,
congress
did
insert
equal
protection
language.
i
think
that
it
certainly
is
not
a
great
extension
of
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
court
to
give
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
private
damage
action
under
the
present
circumstances,
because
each
one
of
those
four
items
which
occurs
in
section
1985,
subsection
(2),
first
phrase
or
first
clause,
involves
matters
which
are
within
the
contempt
power
of
the
court.
and
apparently
congress
felt
that
it
would
assist
the
court
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
its
own
processes
by
giving
private
actions
to
all
parties
who
might
be
damaged
by
such
interference
with
the
judicial
processes
of
the
federal
courts.
finally,
i
think
that
clearly
we
do
not
require
any
fourteenth
amendment
mandate
or
sanction
in
order
to
have
congress
legislate
with
respect
to
the
four
items
occurring
in
the
first
part
of
that
subsection.
the
power
to
regulate
federal
courts
and
to
give
federal
courts
whatever
powers
are
necessary
to
regulate
its
own
functioning
is
found
in
article
i,
section
8,
of
the
constitution.
with
respect
to
the
so-called
split
of
districts,
or
rather
court
of
appeals,
on
this
issue,
i
think
that
a
close
reading
of
the
two
cases,
one
in
the
fifth
circuit,
which
is
the
kimble
case,
and
the
jones
case
which
was
in
the
eighth
circuit,
would
show
that
actually
none
of
those
cases
involved
a
claim
which
fell
within
the
first
portion
of
section
1985,
subsection
(2).
in
kimble,
the
plaintiff
sued
employers
for
denying
him
employment
because
of
his
prior
history
of
filing
lawsuits
under
workman's
compensation
claims.
well,
certainly
that
doesn't
fall
under
any
of
the
four
items
of
the
first
clause
of
section
1985(2).
so
i
think
the
court
correctly
ruled
that
he
didn't
have
a
claim
under
the
first
portion.
with
respect
to
the
jones
case,
that
involved
a
case
where
a
mistrial
was
declared
because
the
u.s.
attorney
had
used
electronic
surveillance
equipment
to
monitor
a
juror
to
determine
whether
the
juror
was
going
to
be
contacted
by
a
party.
now,
that
particular
claim
i
don't
think
falls
under
any
of
the
first
four
items
of
1985(2)
either.
so
a
close
study
of
those
two
cases
would
indicate
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
in
the
opinions
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit
which
is
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
respondent
here.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
your
honor,
i
believe
they
were,
but
i
don't
think
an
examination
of
the
precise
claim
that
each
plaintiff
was
advancing--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--your
honor,
i
believe
they
were.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
and
i
believe
that
the
first
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia,
of
course,
were
correct
in
their
decisions.
but
i
certainly
did
not
see
a
claim
under
the
first
portion
of
section
1985(2)
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
eighth
circuit
cases.
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
griffin
v.
breckenridge,
i
don't
think
that
that
of
course
involves
or
really
is
relevant
to
this
case
at
all,
because
griffin
v.
breckenridge
was
based
on
a
1985
subsection
(3)
claim,
which
very
clearly
contains
equal
protection
language.
furthermore,
the
court
in
griffin
v.
breckenridge
based
its
decision
not
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
on
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
on
the
right
to
interstate
travel.
so
i
don't
think
that
case
is
on
point.
we
certainly
don't
think
that
there's
any
danger
here
of
creating
a
federal
tort
law,
because
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case
a
party
would
already
have
to
be
in
the
federal
court
on
another
matter
in
order
for
him
to
allege
that
his
witnesses
were
being
intimidated.
so
really,
plaintiff
kevin
rutledge
would
have
to
have
another
claim
under
federal
jurisdiction
in
order
to
have
a
1985
subsection
(2)
claim.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
could
be
possible
if
the
plaintiff
were
so
sure
that
witnesses
were
already
being
intimidated
and
he
had
every
intention
of
filing
that
lawsuit
in
the
federal
court.
i
could
see--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
believe
that
a
witness
under
those
circumstances
would
involve
potential
witnesses,
because
theoretically
i
think
it
would
be
rather
hypertechnical
to
take
the
position
that
you
really
don't
have
a
witness
until
you
go
to
trial
and
call
him.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
well,
under
those
conditions,
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
agree.
but
if,
for
example,
you
had
circumstances
under
which
the
public
passion
and
prejudice
against
the
particular
party
was
so
strong
that
he
was
certain
that
he
wanted
to
proceed
in
the
federal
court,
then
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
circumstance.
but
that
would
not
apply
to
this
case
in
any
respect,
because
we
had
a
complaint
filed
at
the
time
the
amended
complaint
was
made
setting
forth
this
1985(2)
claim.
it
was
also
the
position
of
the
plaintiff-respondent
below
that
he
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
member
of
a
class,
and
the
class
of
which
he
was
a
member
was
a
group
of
players
who
did
not
meet
the
standards
of
the
defendant
kush.
and
i
think
that
a
factual
statement
would
explain
why
that
makes
some
sense,
and
that
is
that
beginning
in
1978--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that...
in
that
context
i
would
agree
with
you.
but
the
facts
in
this
case
were
different
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
recognize
that
in
1978
arizona
state
university
suddenly
shifted
from
the
western
athletic
conference,
where
they
were
competing
with
teams
like
wyoming
and
new
mexico
and
texas
el
paso,
to
the
pac
10,
where
they
were
competing
with
teams
like
usc,
ucla,
stanford,
washington,
et
cetera.
at
the
same
time,
under
ncaa
regulations
each
coach
could
give
out
30
scholarships
per
year
to
athletes,
but
no
more
than
95
scholarships
total.
so
this
created
a
situation
where
you
had
to
get
rid
of
some
players.
in
order
to
give
out
30
scholarships
this
year,
you
could
not
have
30
players
stay
on
the
team
from
which
you
had
given
30
scholarships
in
the
three
prior
years.
you'd
have
120
and
the
maximum
is
95.
now,
that
particular
restriction
has
been
responsible
more
than
anything
else
to
the
recent
equalization,
you
might
say,
in
power
among
the
football
teams
in
the
nation.
and
this
restriction
provided
a
grave
problem
for
many
coaches,
but
it
had
no
impact
whatsoever
on
kush
because
he
had
such
an
effective
means
of
getting
rid
of
players
who
did
not
meet
his
standards.
and--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--in
the
complaint
with
respect
to
this
particular
claim,
the
1985
claim?
mr.
robert
ong
hing
that
appears
on
paragraph
56
of
the
complaint.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
i
believe
that's
appendix
e-11
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
e-11.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
right.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
basically.
mr.
robert
ong
hing
basically,
the
situation
was
such
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
rid
of
certain
players,
and
under
ncaa
regulations
you
could
not
get
rid
of
a
player
for
any
athletic
reason.
in
other
words,
once
you
give
a
player
a
scholarship
and
say
come
to
school,
he
in
effect
has
a
scholarship
for
four
years
even
though
he
turns
out
to
be
a
miserable
football
player,
as
long
as
he
comes
to
practice
and
makes
himself
available.
well,
the
defendant
kush
had
an
effective
means
of
getting
rid
of
those
people
in
that
category,
and
the
plaintiff
kush
was
in
that
group
of
people,
the
group
that
were
offered
scholarships
that
did
not
meet
his
playing
specifications
or
expectations
and
players
that
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
in
order
to
make
scholarships
available
so
that
he
could
continue
to
give
out
30
scholarships
every
year
to
incoming
players.
in
conclusion,
the
plaintiff
kevin
rutledge--
mr.
robert
ong
hing
--we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
