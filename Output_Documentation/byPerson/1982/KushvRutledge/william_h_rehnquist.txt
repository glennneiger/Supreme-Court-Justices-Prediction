justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gallagher,
i
would
like
to
get
a
time
sequence
straight
if
i
could.
this
action
alleged
intimidation
of
witnesses
in
the
federal
court
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
federal
court
case
go
to
trial
on
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
the
only
case
in
which
there
could
have
been
witnesses
would
i'm
sure
be
the
state
court
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
there
are
no
witnesses
in
a
case
until
the
case
has
been
tried.
there
may
be
potential
witnesses.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
there
been
any
proceedings
on
remand
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
the
actual
intimidation
occurred
then?
the
state
court
witnesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
witnesses
in
what
proceeding
did
it
claim
was
intimidated,
or
were
intimidated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
could
you
determine
whether...
who
were
witnesses
in
the
federal
court
proceeding
if
there
had
been
no
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
my
concern
can
be
solved
right
there.
you
say
the
statute
extends
to
potential
witnesses,
then,
not
just
people
who
had
been
given
on
witness
lists
immediately
prior
to
trial
or
who
had
been
witnesses
at
depositions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
agree,
then,
that
if
a
complaint
were
not
yet
filed
in
federal
court
there
could
be
no
claim
that
potential
witnesses
in
a
later
to
be
filed
lawsuit
were
intimidated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
define
"witness"
in
that
broader
sense?
i
mean,
a
witness
ordinarily
is
someone
who
is
summoned
to
testify
in
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
isn't
the
harm
which
congress
sought
to
avoid
here
the
harm
to
the
functioning
of
the
federal
courts?
and
if
you
have
no
complaint
filed,
conceivably
you,
if
you
ever
did
file
a
lawsuit,
might
be
in
state
court,
why
is
there
any
offense
to
the
federal
system
if
you
simply,
say,
threaten
an
eyewitness
to
a
traffic
accident?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
have
an
assault
case,
can't
you
say
in
almost
any
assault
case
that
the
person
assaulted
was
a
member
of
a
class
who
didn't
meet
the
standards
of
the
person
who
assaulted
them?
