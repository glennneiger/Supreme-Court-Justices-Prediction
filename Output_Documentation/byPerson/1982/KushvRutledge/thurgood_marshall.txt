the
complaint
here
anyplace?
justice
thurgood
marshall

i
have
an
appendix
here
that
has
nothing,
and
i
mean
nothing.
oh,
that.
well,
now
i
see
what
it
is.
the
petition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
well,
i
got
mislaid
by
this
thing.
i
don't
know
what
this
is.
thank
you.
i
got
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
a
crime,
isn't
it?
that's
a
specific
crime...
to
injure
a
witness--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--can
you
enjoin
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
counselor,
i
have
to
ask
you.
i
still
don't
see
the
clause
or
what
you're
asking
for
in
this
document
here.
i
see
in
one
place
you're
asking
for
$1
million
punitive
damages.
what
exactly
did
you
ask
for
in
your
complaint,
in
a
place
where
i
can
read
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
respect
to
the
case
you're
asking
us
to
decide.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
where
will
i
find
that
in
anything
that's
here
before
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
e-11?
e?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
that's
it.
i
can
see
that.
that's
just
before
count
five?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
some
pleading
i
never
understood
in
my
life.
actual
damages
of
a
million
dollars,
punitive
damage
of
another
million;
that's
all
you
want?
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
except
interest.
