justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
indicated
that
the
state
trial
did
go
forward
and
was
completed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
part
of
your
claim
that
any
federal
issue
is
res
judicata?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
couldn't
all
these
claims
in
federal
court
have
been
presented
in
the
state
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
federal
court...
didn't
the
federal
court...
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
remand
to
the
district
court
to
see
whether
any
claim
survived
the
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
could
be
that...
it
could
be
that
the
district
court
will
decide
that
the
entire
matter
is
res
judicata.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
we're
just
whistling
in
the
breeze.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court...
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
they
thought
that
they
were
deciding
contrary
to
the
fifth
and
the
eighth
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
wrong
in
saying
that
they
were
in
conflict
with
the
fifth
and
the
eighth.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
