mr.
barnett,
as
i
understand
your
position,
the
sandstrom
function
is
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
directed
verdict.
if
so,
why
was
the
case
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
attempted
murder
question
at
all?
why
didn't
the
judge
simply
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law
he
concluded
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
go
to
the
jury
on
that
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why?
you
say
the
instruction
was
the
equivalent--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--of
a
directed
verdict--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--on
the
issue
of
intent.
intent
is
a
necessary
element
of
the
crime,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what's
the
difference
in
this
instance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
a
judge?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--can
you
have
a
directed
verdict
in
connecticut
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
never?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
can
the
judge
just
dismiss
that
count?
