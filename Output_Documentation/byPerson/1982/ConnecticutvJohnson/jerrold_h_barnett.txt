mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case...
this
case
involves
the
question
of
whether
an
admittedly
unconstitutional
instruction
that
posited
the
element
of
intent
as
a
question
of
law,
contrary
to
decisions
of
this
court,
and
which
remained
uncured
in
a
viewing
of
the
charge
as
a
whole,
can
ever
be
considered
harmless
error
by
virtue
of
the
strength
of
the
state's
evidence.
that
is
the
position
that
the
petitioner
has
taken
here
today,
and
it
is
the
position
taken
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
there
is
really
no
question
that
the
error
was
not
corrected
by
the
remainder
of
the
charge.
there
has
been
some
mention
that
the
inference
charge
on
intent,
concededly
permissible
in
the
specific
instructions
on
the
kidnapping
charge,
constituted
some
sort
of
a
cure,
but
the
connecticut
supreme
court
ruled
otherwise
when
it
refused
to
import
the
kidnapping
instructions
into
the
instructions
on
robbery
which
was
the
third
count,
for
the
reason
that
the
structure
of
the
charge
did
not
permit
such
a
construction.
the
initial
error
was
made
common
to
all
crimes
involved
in
the
information.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
that's
the
one
that
appears
on
page
23a,
justice
brennan.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
the
word
"conclusive",
where
the
jury
was
instructed
on
a
rule
of
law
that
every
person
is
conclusively
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
and
necessary
consequences
of
his
act,
and
of
course
in
sandstrom
versus
montana,
this
court
noted
that
"presume"
had
a
common
meaning
of
acceptance
of
a
proposition
as
true
without
proof,
and
"conclusively",
of
course,
has
common
meanings
of
irrefutable,
final,
and
decisive.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
i
do
not
understand
the
state's
position
to
be
such,
your
honor.
i
understand
the
state's
position
to
be
that
a
cure
may
have
been
effected
by
the
specific
instructions
on
kidnapping.
however,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
refused
to
follow
such
a
suggestion
because
of
the
structure
of
the
charge,
and
further,
it
could
only
mean
that
if
the
state's
position
were
made
and
considered,
that
the
jury
would
have
been
submitted
these
crimes
on
two
theories,
one
concededly
unconstitutional,
and
one
claimed
to
be
constitutional,
and
i
believe
that
settled
law
is
that
if
the
theories
are
to
be
viewed
as
alternatives,
that
the
unconstitutionality,
the
admitted
unconstitutionality
would
require
the
convictions
to
be
set
aside.
yes,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
my
position,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
it
would
be
proper
for
an
appellate
court
to
rule
on
the
possibility
of
misunderstanding
solely
from
the
language
of
the
charge,
that
if
there
was
language
which
imported
a
conclusive
presumption
that
the
error
could
only
be
corrected
in
the
charge.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
i
think
that
the
appellate
court
would
have
to
rule
or
would
rule
in
my
opinion
that
there
was
no
violation
of
sandstrom
because
the
charge
has
to
be
considered
as
a
whole.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
i
so
think,
your
honor,
and
i
base
that
on
what
i
am
going
to
posit
to
the
court
is
a
concept
of
what
is
a
jury's
verdict,
and
i
refer
to
language
used
by
justice
rutledge
in
kotteokos
versus
the
united
states,
where
he
said
that
a
verdict
is
more
than
a
judgment
on
the
facts.
a
verdict
is
a
judgment
of
law
rendered
by
a
court
of
laymen,
and
i
think
that
that
language
explains
why
this
court
has
treated
incidents
of
instructional
error
differently
than
it
has
treated
incidents
of
evidentiary
error.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
no,
i
do
not
make
that
suggestion.
my
suggestion
is
that
although
petitioner
has
not
placed
much
emphasis
on
the
word
"conclusively",
that
when
the
connecticut
supreme
court
said
that
the
convictions
had
to
be
overturned
because
the
word
"conclusively"
was
used,
"conclusively"
became
more
than
a
word,
and
i
think
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
shows
that.
"conclusively"
became
a
concept.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
overturned
these
convictions
because
in
its
opinion
this
instruction
withdrew
the
element
of
intent
from
the
jury's
factfinding
function
insofar
as
attempted
murder,
where
it
was
specifically
stated
for
the
second
time,
and
insofar
as
the
crime
of
robbery
was
concerned,
where
nothing
was
stated
as
to
how
the
element
of
intent
should
be
ascertained,
and
it
became
a
sort
of
guessing
game
between
the
invalid
presumption
and
the
subsequent
mention
of
inference
in
the
kidnapping
instructions,
and
by
taking
it
from
the
factfinding
function
of
the
jury,
by
effectively
eliminating
intent
as
an
element
of
the
crime,
what
has
been
done
is
that
the
factual
elements
of
the
crime
have
been
taken
from
the
decision
of
the
only
body
which
is
constitutionally
able
to
make
that
decision,
namely,
the
jury.
and
in
brief,
my
position
here
today
is
that
the
invalid
presumption
amounted
to
a
directed
verdict.
it
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
that
is
true,
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
stated
that
the
court
has
treated
instances
of
instructional
error
differently
from
instances
of
evidentiary
error,
such
as
existed
in
harrington.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
i
am
relying
on
wyler
versus
the
united
states,
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters
and
joiners
versus
the
united
states,
bollenbach
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
yes,
they
were.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
that
is
correct,
but
i
believe
that
this
court
in
chapman
versus
california
mentioned
that
the
rule
adopted
in
that
case,
very
much
like
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
that
preceded
it,
was
not
designed
to
relate
to
substantial
rights,
so
i
think
those
cases
do
become
very
relevant.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
well,
i
think
that
the
idea
of
directed
verdicts
and
their
functional
equivalents
have
been
discussed
by
this
court
lately.
i
refer
to
justice
brennan's
concurrence
in
chiarella
versus
united
states,
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs,
that
where
it...
where
the
error
is
evidentiary,
apparently
from
the
nature
of
the
violation,
the
material
is
admitted
improperly
for
the
jury's
factfinding
determination.
therefore,
on
review,
a
court
can
eliminate
that
tainted
item
and
make
a
determination
of
what
impact
it
had
upon
the
jury,
and
furthermore,
in
evidentiary
matter,
the
jury,
of
course,
is
told
that
it
is
the
supreme
judge
of
facts,
it
may
accept
or
reject
any
evidence.
when
it
comes
to
instructional
error,
the
jury
has
no
choice.
the
jury
is
always
told
that
it
has
a
duty
to
abide
by
the
instructions
given
to
it
by
the
court,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
said
that
the
crucial
assumption
behind
the
constitutional
scheme
of
trial
by
jury
is
that
the
jury
will
listen,
follow,
and
obey
the
instructions.
so
therefore
in
the
case
of
instructional
error,
you
must
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
error
had
an
impact
on
the
jury
in
the
sense
that
they
understood
and
followed.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
it
cannot
be
cured
except
by
other
language
in
the
charge.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
into
the
robbery--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
--conviction.
justice
brennan,
i
believe
it
is
footnote
4
of
my
brief
where
i
mention
that
the
robbery...
the
effect
of
this
court's
decision
on
the
robbery
conviction
will
not
afford
mr.
johnson
one
less
day
in
the
prison.
footnote
3
sets
forth
the
sentences,
which
are
consecutive
and
which
are
concurrent.
and
footnote
4
mentions
that
mr.
johnson
petitioned
this
court,
and
his
petition
was
denied,
and
as
a
result
of
concurrent
sentences
on
robbery
and
kidnapping,
it
really
is
not
factually
going
to
make
much
difference.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
even
on
parole.
it
will
not
make
much
difference.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
that,
on
parole,
i
cannot
tell
you,
your
honor,
whether
it
will
definitely
make
any
difference
or
not.
we
have
had
some
recent
statutory
changes,
and
i
am
not
quite
certain
how
much
credits
would
be
allocated
to
him.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
it
would
increase
his
past
record.
he
is
a
recidivist
at
the
present
time,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
it's
the
robbery.
what
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did
in
its
construction
of
the
charge
is
that
it
took
the
general
instructions
and
analyzed
them
and
found
uncured
error.
then
it
made
an
analysis
between
the
general
instructions
and
the
specific
instructions
on
each
crime.
for
attempted
murder,
the
error
was
compounded.
for
kidnapping
in
the
second
degree,
the
second
charge
in
the
information,
the
court
felt
that
the
error
was
cured
by
the
permissive
inference
language
that
attended
the
description
on
how
intent
should
be
ascertained
for
that
crime.
on
the
third
charge,
robbery
in
the
first
degree,
the
court
went
to
great
lengths
in
describing
the
nature
of
the
intent,
but
it
never
described
how
the
intent
should
be
ascertained,
so
the
jury
was
left
with
two
specific
instructions
which
could
be
construed
as
at
variance
with
each
other,
the
attempted
murder,
admittedly
invalid,
and
the
kidnapping,
admittedly
valid,
plus
the
general
instruction
which
had
been
made
common
to
all
crimes,
and
in
the
truppi
case,
which
is
referred
to
in
a
footnote
in
my
brief,
this
procedure
is
set
forth.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
in
the
truppi
case
held
that
by
giving
a
general
instruction
on
intent,
the
jury
would
interpret
that
general
instruction
every
time
the
court
mentioned
intent.
so
therefore,
when
it
came
to
robbery,
the
court
refused
and
properly
so
to
speculate
on
which
prior
instruction
the
jury
had
adopted,
and
on
that
basis
overturned
the
robbery
conviction
also.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
well,
justice
white,
i
think
that
much
of
it
depends
upon
the
instruction.
where
the
instruction
has
been
given
as
a
conclusive
presumption
and
is
removed
from
the
jury,
i
believe
that
this
court
recognized
in
the
united
brotherhood
case
that...
and
in
the
wyler
case...
that
to
ask
the
court
to
decide
a
factual
element
that
was
not
properly
submitted
to
the
jury
was,
in
effect,
asking
the
court--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
--in
an
evidentiary--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
--yes.
in
the
evidentiary
situations
it's
somewhat
different
because
of
the
nature
of
the
violation
and
the
fact
that
the
inquiry
proceeds
at
a
lower
level,
it
does
not
proceed
on
the
level--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
--oh,
absent
the
evidence?
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
it
is,
but
it
can
perform
it
because
it
can
say
with
some
certitude
that
this
tainted
item
of
evidence
had
no
impact
on
the
jury.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
first,
the
appellate
court
must
assume
that
the
jury
followed
the
instruction.
so
if
the
jury--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
--yes.
that
the
jury
followed
the
instruction,
so
if
in
the
decisional
process
the
jury
used
the
invalid
presumption
as
a
way
to
find
guilt,
it
does
not
affect
a
cure
merely
because
the
appellate
court
can
say
the
jury
would
have
convicted
on
the
evidence
anyway,
because
it
would
show
that
the
jury
did
not
act
properly
in
considering
intent
as
a
factual
element
to
be
adjudged
in
terms
of
all
the
evidence.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
no,
your
honor.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
no,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
if
the
jury
used
an
improper
decisional
process
fostered
by
the
instruction
which
it
must
be
presumed
that
they
followed,
then
that
is
an
error
that
affected
the
verdict.
and
that
is
the
test
under
chapman
v.
california.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
and
the
test
is
not
whether
the
same
result
would
have
been
achieved
had
the
error
not
have
occurred.
that
is
the
test.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
i
must
answer
the
question
this
way,
justice
rehnquist--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
--yes,
i
can
answer
it
yes
or
no.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
but
may
i
explain
my
answer
a
little.
my
answer
is
that,
no,
an
appellate
court
could
not
in
the
case
of
an
instruction
worded
as
this
one,
because
the
wording
of
this
instruction
means
that
it
did
not
reach
the
jury
in
the
manner
in
which
it
is
constitutionally
required
to.
and
for
that
reason
the
confession
and
the
admissions
of
counsel
would
not
act
to
cure.
and
that,
i
think,
is
one
of
the
difficulties
that
courts
have
had
with
the
sandstrom
situation
where
the
instruction
was
capable
of
two
interpretations
and
where
the
claims
may
before
this
court,
somewhat
belatedly,
were
that
the
error
was
harmless
because
assume
it
was
burden
shifting,
the
burden
didn't
matter
because
of
sandstrom's
confession.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
that
is
my
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
if
the
instruction
posited
as
conclusive,
and
i
draw
that
to
the
analogy
to
the
directed
verdict,
that
no
court
has
the
power
to
direct
a
verdict
in
a
criminal
case
no
matter
how
conclusive
the
evidence
may
be.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
i
maintain
that
position.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
well,
it
depends,
if
your
honor
please,
i
submit,
on
what
type
of
error
has
been
committed.
i
maintain
that
position
because
of
decisions
from
this
court
that
there
are
institutions
that
have
certain
functions
and
that
if
the
function
of
one
institution
is
taken
away
from
it,
then
the
error
cannot
be
cured
because
of
the
constitutional
requirement
of
trial
by
jury.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
no,
i
most
certainly
do
not.
i
concede
it
was
the
most
unambiguous
instruction
there
could
be.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
justice
stevens,
perhaps
i
should
start
with
answering
something
that
you
asked
of
ms.
lager.
the
harmless
error
rule
in
connecticut
for
criminal
cases
generally
revolves
about
a
case
called
the
state
v.
evans,
which
is
cited
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
the
section
which
explains
how
the
error
was
considered
below.
state
v.
evans
rests
on
two
premises:
the
connecticut
supreme
court
will
consider
on
a
plain
error
basis
claims
where
error
was
not
claimed
at
the
trial
level
when
a
newly
articulated
constitutional
position
is
announced
by
this
court
and
where
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
may
have
been
deprived
of
a
fair
trial
because
of
denial
of
constitutional
right.
and
in
this
case
the
decision
notes
that
they
have
accepted
claims
made
on
the
basis
that
this
court's
decision
in
sandstrom
v.
montana.
but
they
have
never
ruled
on
a
case
where
the
claim
of
error
involved
an
instruction
stated
conclusively
as
this
one.
subsequently,
in
turcio
v.
manson
in
a
habeas
corpus
case,
convictions
were
reversed.
the
instruction
was
either
the
same
or
similar
to
this.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
no,
if
your
honor
please,
it
means
that
they
have
taken
the
position
that
failure
to
object
to
the
instruction
at
trial
will
not
bar
you
from
appellate
review
in
the
sense
of
wainwright
v.
sykes.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
i
don't
believe
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has
passed
on
that
question.
error
has
been
found
to
exist
or
not
to
exist
according
to
the
language
of
the
instructions.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
they
rejected
it
because
the
error,
the
instructional
error,
was
uncured
by
the
remainder
of
the
charge
and
because
of
its
conclusive,
expressly
stated
conclusive
nature,
removed
the
element
that
could
have
been
interpreted
by
a
reasonable
jury.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
no.
they--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
--the
decision
does
not
expressly
address
that.
but
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
the
decision
that
an
error
of
this
type
can
be
cured
only
in
the
charge.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
that
certainly
would
have
been
error,
justice
powell.
i
think
it
certainly
would
have
been
error.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
yes.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
yes.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
yes,
it
is.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
if
the
judge
had
said--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
no,
you
most
certainly
cannot.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
never.
and
it
is
my
claim
that
this
instruction
was
the
equivalent
of
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
well,
the
question,
your
honor,
is
why
would
the
judge
dismiss
the
count?
we
claim
that
the
count
was
improperly
submitted
to
the
jury
because
the
jury
was
directed
to
find
on
an
element
of
the
count
of
attempted
murder.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
the
jury
still,
as
a
factual
situation,
would...
that
is
the
only,
the
only,
element
in
which
the
conclusive
presumption
was
used.
everything
else
was
posited
as
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
no,
i
haven't,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
connecticut
supreme
court
accepted
the
claim.
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief
in
a
footnote
that
the
statement
in
the
state
v.
ruiz,
referred
to
by
ms.
lager,
was
not
made
in
the
situation
of
an
approved
jury
instruction.
it
was
made
in
a
comment
by
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
to
a
claim
that
the
evidence
in
a
certain
case
was
insufficient
on
which
to
base
a
jury's
verdict
of
guilt.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
yes,
it
is,
sir.
however,
this
is
a
case
on
direct
review,
and
i
think
the
connecticut
supreme
court
was
quite
proper
in
treating
it
under--
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
yes,
yes,
justice
brennan.
mr.
jerrold
h.
barnett
it
did.
and
fully
considered
the
issue.
thank
you,
your
honors,
for
the
privilege
of
addressing
you.
