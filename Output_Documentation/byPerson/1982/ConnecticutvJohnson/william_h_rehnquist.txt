justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
lager,
am
i
right
in
thinking
this
about
the
state's
position,
that
the
questions
as
to
whether
the
instructions
considered
as
a
whole
might
have
improperly
influenced
the
jury
on
the
constitutional
issue
of
burden
of
proof
go
into
deciding
whether
or
not
there
was
so-called
sandstrom
error,
and
then
the
question
of
harmless
error
is
whether
on
that,
on
the
issue
that
the
instructions
were
addressed
to,
the
evidence
was
so
overwhelming
that
probably
no
damage
was
done?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
your
response
assumes
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
at
any
rate
simply
took
one
instruction
in
isolation,
and
said,
look,
this
violates
the
sandstrom
case,
and
then
didn't
treat
the
other
portions
of
the
instructions
that
might
be
assumed
to
counteract
that
effect.
i
read
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut's
opinion
somewhat
differently,
that
they
assimilated
all
the
balancing
of
the
various
parts
of
the
instructions
into
the
final
question,
did
it
improperly
influence
the
jury
in
an
unconstitutional
way,
into
the
question
of
was
there
sandstrom
error,
and
therefore
the
question
of
the
harmlessness
of
that
error
would
have
to
be
taken
somehow
out
of
the...
outside
of
the
instructions,
which
have
already
been
fully
canvassed
in
the
determination
of
whether
there
was
constitutional
error.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
that
extend
to
a
situation
where
the
instruction
on
intent
is
clearly
wrong
under
sandstrom,
and
there
is
no
redeeming
instruction
whatever,
so
that
if
you
are
simply
canvassing
the
instructions,
you
have
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
jury
was
improperly
instructed
in
violation
of
sandstrom,
but
the
testimony
at
the
trial
is
that
the
defendant
took
the
stand
on
the
question
of
intent,
perhaps
was
asked
the
question,
did
you
intend
to
do
this,
and
the
defendant
said,
sure.
they
were
defending
maybe
on
self-defense
or
something
like
that,
so
that
you
would
say
the
error
was
harmless
not
because
of
anything
contained
in
the
instructions,
but
because
the
evidence
on
that
issue
was
so
overwhelming
the
jury
would
have
reached
that
conclusion
no
matter
what
burden
of
proof
it
had
been
assigned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
barnett,
supposing
that
an
appellate
court
reviewing
a
claim
of
sandstrom
error
in
the
charge
to
the
jury
saw
there
was
one
sentence
in
a
very
long
set
of
instructions
that
might
be
interpreted
as
suggesting
a
conclusive
presumption,
but
came
across
seven
or
eight
restatements
of
the
proposition,
as
you
often
get
in
a
series
of
complicated
instructions,
which
simply
used
the...
clearly
spoke
in
terms
of
an
inference
that
was
permissible
under
the
sandstrom
decision.
it
concludes
on
the
basis
of
all
that
that
the
jury
simply
wasn't
misled.
now,
is
the
proper
result
for
that
appellate
court
to
say
there
was
no
sandstrom
error,
or
that
there
was
sandstrom
error
but
it
was
harmless,
without
examining
into
the
evidence
at
all?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
the
appellate
court
concludes
that
it
was
corrected
in
the
charge,
that
there
is
something
that
taken
all
by
itself
might
be
sandstrom
error,
but
other
parts
of
the
charge
really
cured
it,
so
that
the
impact
on
the
jury
was
de
minimis.
now,
is
the
answer
that
the
appellate
court
reaches
in
that
situation
that
there
was
no
violation
of
sandstrom
or
that
there
was
a
violation
but
it
was
harmless
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
barnett,
isn't
your
position
basically
an
attack
on
the
whole
notion
of
harmless
error?
certainly
in
harrington
against
california,
the
court
seemed
to
have
been
faced
with
a
similar
argument,
the
argument
that
you
can't
put
yourself
in
the
position...
an
appellate
court
can't
put
itself
in
the
position
of
jurors,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
it
said,
we
don't
know,
of
course,
what
jurors
sat,
but
our
judgment
has
to
be
based
on
our
reading
of
the
record
and
what
seems
to
be
the
probable
impact
of
two
confessions
on
the
minds
of
an
average
jury.
certainly,
in
that
case,
they
thought
they
could
decide
what
a
reasonable
jury
would
have
done
without
that
particular
unconstitutional
bruton
violation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
cases
are
you
relying
on
for
treatment
of
instances
of
instructional
error?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
of
those
were
trials
in
federal
court,
weren't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
wasn't
the
court
in
those
cases
interpreting
a
statute
of
congress
providing
that
technical
errors
shouldn't
be
used
as
ground
for
reversal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
reason
why
one
should
govern
the
other,
is
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it
won't
make
much
difference.
will
it
make
any
difference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
hypothesis
that
i
posed
to
your
opponent?
supposing
that
the
jury
is
erroneously
instructed
along
the
conclusively
presume
lines
on
the
issue
of
intent;
the
evidence
at
trial
shows
the
defendant
took
the
stand,
admitted
intent,
simply
advanced
a
self-defense
defense
by
way
of
avoiding
a
guilty
verdict.
and
during
closing
argument
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
says,
we
concede
intent,
what
we
are
really
arguing
about
here
is
self-defense;
we
think
you
should
find
him
not
guilty
for
that
reason.
it
goes
to
the
appellate
court.
you
say
they
could
not
say
in
the
light
of
this
situation
that
whatever
burden
of
proof
was
put
on
the
state
with
respect
to
the
element
of
intent,
a
reasonable
jury
would
have
found
it
met
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
cannot
answer
it
yes
or
no?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
going
to
take
some
time
doing
it.
okay.
