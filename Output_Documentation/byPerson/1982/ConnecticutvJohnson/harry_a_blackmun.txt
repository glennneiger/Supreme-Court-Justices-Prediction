justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
did
it
take

years
in

connecticut
court
to
get
decided?
justice
harry
a.

does
this
happen
frequently
in
the
state
of

somewhat
unusual?

--18

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
what
you
just
said.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that's
a
matter
of
discretion
on
the

part.

have
to.
justice

blackmun

obliged

the
second
case
is
no.
81927,
connecticut
against
johnson
coming
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut.
there
is
no
majority
opinion,
so
i
shall
merely
state
the
facts
and
the
result.
in
a
jury
trial
in
a
connecticut
state
court,
the
respondent,
johnson,
was
convicted
of
all
charges
under
a
multicount
information,
including
charges
of
attempted
murder
and
robbery.
the
trial
court's
general
instructions
to
the
jury
included
one
to
the
effect
and
i
quote,
"a
person's
intention
may
be
inferred
from
his
conduct
and
every
person
is
conclusively
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
and
necessary
consequences
of
his
act."
while
respondent's
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
was
is
pending,
this
court
decided
a
case
called
sandstrom
against
montana
which
held
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
violated
by
jury
instruction
of
this
kind,
because
a
reasonable
juror
might
have
viewed
it
as
creating
a
conclusive
presumption
of
intent
or
as
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
intent.
sandstrom
however,
left
open
the
question
whether
if
a
jury
is
so
instructed,
the
error
can
ever
be
harmless.
thereafter,
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
while
affirming
the
respondent's
convictions
on
other
counts,
reversed
his
convictions
for
attempted
murder
and
robbery
because
of
the
instruction.
without
discussing
the
state's
argument
that
the
sandstrom
violation
was
harmless,
the
court
concluded
that
the
conclusive
presumption
language
of
the
general
instructions
was
not
cured
by
specific
instructions
on
attempted
murder
and
robbery.
the
court
affirms
that
judgment.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
joined
by
justice
brennan,
justice
white,
and
justice
marshall,
whereby
we
conclude
that
the
instructional
error
deprived
the
respondent
of
his
constitutional
rights.
justice
stevens,
in
a
separate
opinion,
concludes
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
should
be
dismissed,
because
however,
the
vote
otherwise
was
four
to
four.
he
joined
the
disposition
allowing
the
connecticut
supreme
court's
judgment
to
stand.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
powell
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
o'connor.
