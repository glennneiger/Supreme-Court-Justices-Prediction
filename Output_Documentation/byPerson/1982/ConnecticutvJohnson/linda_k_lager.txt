ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
the
state
prosecution
is
entitled
to
show
that
a
constitutional
error
in
an
unobjected
to
portion
of
a
lengthy,
detailed,
and
elaborate
jury
instruction
is
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
1981,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
foreclosed
the
prosecution
that
opportunity
by
automatically
reversing
the
respondent's
1976
convictions
on
attempted
murder
and
robbery
after
finding
sandstrom
error.
that
finding
of
sandstrom
error
was
premised
solely
on
the
court's
use
of
the
word
"conclusively"
twice,
and
the
balance
of
the
instructions
were
in
fact
described
by
the
connecticut
supreme
court
as
"precise,
elaborate,
and
cast
in
highly
permissive
language.
"
and
the
connecticut
supreme
court
also
found
that
if
the
word
"conclusively"
had
not
been
used
in
this
jury
instruction,
it
would
not
have
found
sandstrom
error.
the
state
maintains
that
a
finding
of
an
arguably
conclusive
presumption
did
not
warrant
automatic
reversal
in
this
case.
furthermore,
the
state
of
connecticut
maintains
that
a
reviewing
court
can
determine
the
impact
of
an
unconstitutional
jury
instruction
on
the
verdict,
and
that
in
this
case,
because
the
instruction
could
have
no
impact
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
the
instruction
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
charged
with
four
crimes
that
took
place
on
saturday
night
and
early
sunday
morning
of
december
20th
and
21st,
1975,
the
weekend
before
christmas.
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
to
this
court
the
sordid
details
of
the
rape
and
the
kidnapping
aspects
of
this
case,
because
they
are
not
before
this
court.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
the
case
was...
excuse
me.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
decided
the
case
in
1981
principally
because
there
were
problems
in
obtaining
the
complete
transcript.
in
fact,
most
of
the
trial
transcript
had
been
obtained
in
1977
and
1978.
then
it
was
discovered
that
there
were
portions
missing.
those
portions
involved
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
in
this
case,
there
were
initially
five
defendants,
and
some
of
the
hearings
on
the
motions
to
suppress
were
conducted
jointly
with
other
defendants.
the
last
portion
of
transcript
involving
the
motion
to
suppress
was
received
by
counsel
on
november
26th,
1980.
the
case
was
then
rapidly
briefed
and
argued
in
june
of
1981
under
a
special
briefing
schedule
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
had
set
up.
what
was
involved
in
this
case--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--this
was
a
somewhat
unusual
circumstance.
there
have
been
problems
in
the
state
of
connecticut--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--with
transcription.
i
think
the
length
of
the
delay
in
this
case
was
somewhat...
extremely
unusual.
in
this
case,
the
victim
clearly
had
ample
opportunity
in
over
five
and
a
half
hours
of
being
with
the
respondent
and
his
five
companions
to
view
them.
in
fact,
in
the
course
of
her
testimony
before
the
trial
court,
she
was
able
to
give
clear
identification
of
the
respondent
and
his
co-assailants
by
details
of
clothing
and
physical
description.
it
was
also
undisputed
that
the
respondent
was
the
leader
of
the
group,
that
he
initiated
the
incident,
that
he
took
the
most
active
role,
and
that
he
was
the
most
vicious,
that
he
gave
directions,
that
he
restrained
the
victim,
that
he
threatened
her,
and
that
he
was
the
first
one
to
rape
her.
the
crucial
facts,
i
believe,
before
the
court
are
those
that
are
surrounding
the
robbery
and
the
attempted
murder,
and
i
will
concentrate
this
afternoon
on
the
facts
surrounding
the
attempted
murder
because
in
my
opinion,
and
the
respondent
virtually
concedes
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
intent
necessary
for
robbery
by
not
even
discussing
those
facts
in
his
brief.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
that
is
correct.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
i
believe
that
what
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did
is
decide
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
it
would
not
review
the
error
in
truppi
as
being
harmless.
its
citations
are
solely
to
federal
cases.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
those
citations
are
to
cases
in
which
the
court,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
was
willing
to
apply
a
harmless
error
rule--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--and
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has
indicated
in
a
decision
that
was
decided
on
january
5th
of
1982,
turcio
versus
manson,
which
was
cited
at
page
3
of
the
respondent's
brief,
in
a
footnote
that
they
would
not
decide
in
the
turcio
case
nor
did
they
decide
in
the
johnson
case,
this
case,
that
there
can
be
no
language
or
other
circumstances
which
could
operate
to
cure
an
intent
instruction
containing
the
phrase
"conclusively
presumed".
subsequently,
in
a
decision
of
march
30th,
1982,
state
against
kervin,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
appeared
to
be
moving
towards
this
court's
total
record
review
analysis
in
determining
whether
a
jury
charge
could
be
harmful.
in
that
case,
they
specifically
emphasized
that
the
charge
should
not
be
examined
in
a
vacuum,
that
it
should
be
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
factual
issues
raised
at
the
trial.
the
challenge
in
that
case
was
premised
on
sandstrom
and
based
on
a
claim
that
an
elemental
portion
of
one
of
the
offenses
was
improperly
given.
in
fact,
there
was
a
dissent
that
would
have
held
that
charge
in
violation
of
sandstrom.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
i
think
that
the
state
of
connecticut
has
a
very
ambivalent
position
with
the
application
of
the
harmless
error
rule,
and
i
think
it
has
adopted
a
case
by
case
review.
i
think
the
reason
that
the
court
declined
to
apply
the
harmless
error
doctrine
in
state
against
truppi,
although
they
considered
the
issue
when
it
was
raised
by
the
prosecution,
was
because
of
the
nature
of
the
instruction
that
was
given
in
that
case,
and
in
this
particular
case--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--it
appears
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
sometimes
entertains
the
instruction...
the
challenge
that
the
error
was
harmless
and
sometimes
it
does
not.
the
only
stated
position
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
has
given
in
this
regard
is
the
one
in
state
against
truppi,
is
that
we
sometimes
apply
the
harmless
error
rule.
it
appears
that
if
the--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--no,
your
honor,
my
position
is
not
that
they
must
apply
the
harmless
error
rule
in
every
case,
but
if
the
prosecution
asks
the
connecticut
supreme
court
to
review
an
error
for
its
harmlessness
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
that
it
must
at
least
use
the
harmless
error
test.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
in
the
context
of
an
unconstitutional
jury
instruction,
yes.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
at
23a,
your
honor,
the
court
was
giving
a
general
instruction
with
respect
to
the
question
of
a
finding
of
intent.
the
second
time
that
the
word--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--that
is
correct.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
found,
however,
that
the
language
of
the
instructions
on
the
kidnapping
offense
was
sufficiently
permissible
and
phrased
solely
in
terms
of
inference
therefore
that
any
error
in
the
general
instruction
was
cured
by
that
specific
one.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
in
fact
the
argument
was
made
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
that
what
was
operating
in
this
case
was
not
merely
a
conclusive
presumption
at
all,
that
the
court's
language
was
ambiguous.
the
respondent
in
fact
makes
quite
a
to-do
about
the
fact
that
the
court
instructed
on
a
rule
of
law,
but
the
rule
of
law
that
the
court
instructed
on
is
as
follows.
"the
intent
is
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
find.
"
that
was
clearly
told
to
the
jurors.
and
then
the
court
said,
"however,
you
should
be
aware
of
the
rule
of
law
that
will
be
helpful
to
you,
and
that
is
that
a
person's
intention
may
be
inferred
from
his
conduct,
and
every
person
is
conclusively
presumed
to
intend.
"
ms.
linda
k.
lager
what
the
connecticut
supreme
court
found
is
that
this
general
instruction
that
appears
at
the
bottom
of
pages
22a
and
23a
of
the
appendix
was
unconstitutional
despite
the
other
language
that
was
used
in
the
qualifying
language
in
the
charge.
it
then
proceeded
to
examine
each
of
the
four
separate
offenses
to
determine
whether
there
was
any
spill-over
from
that
general
instruction.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
the
first
being
the
charge
of
attempted
murder.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
that
is
correct.
in
that
portion,
after
the
judge
explained
to
the
jury
that
they
must
find
that
the
respondent
had
the
specific
intent
to
cause
the
death
of
the
victim,
and
they
must
ask
themselves
what
intention
did
the
defendant
have
in
mind,
did
he
alone
or
participating
with
others
intend
to
commit
the
crime
of
murder,
and
that
no
one
could
look
into
a
person's
mind
and
see
what
the
intention
is.
the
court
went
on
to
say
again
in
an
ambiguous
way,
"the
only
way
to
decide
that
question
is
to
infer
from
the
accused's
conduct
in
the
light
of
the
surrounding
circumstances,
but
as
previously
stated,
every
person
is
conclusively
presumed.
"
we
have--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--that
is
an
aspect
of
the
state's
position.
the
state
is
not
before
this
court
to
relitigate
the
connecticut
supreme
court's
finding
that
the
jury
instruction
violated...
the
"conclusively
presumed"
jury
instructions
violated
sandstrom.
the
state's
argument
is
that
the
other
instructions
in
the
charge
and
the
totality
of
the
entire
record
in
this
case,
including
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt,
would
allow
a
reviewing
court
to
assess
the
impact
of
this
unconstitutional
instruction
on
the
outcome
of
the
case.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
i
would
agree
that
if
the
test
that
was
adopted
would
simply
require
a
canvass
of
the
instructions
to
determine
whether
the
sandstrom
error
was
harmless,
as
the
respondent
has
suggested
in
his
brief,
you
would
have
the
equivalent
of
an
automatic
reversal
rule
given
what
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did
in
this
case.
the
state's
argument
before
this
court
is
that
one
must
look
at
the
instructions
as
part
of
the
entire
trial
record,
and
determine--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--yes,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor's
statement.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
no,
your
honor.
the
state's
position
would
be
that
the
appellant
has
the
initial
burden
of
establishing...
the
defendant
below
would
have
the
initial
burden
of
establishing
that
there
was
sandstrom
error,
and
then
according
to
well
established
principles
of
this
court,
the
burden
would
shift
to
the
prosecution
to
establish
that
error
to
be
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
in
shifting
that
burden
to
the
prosecution,
the
appellate
court
would
be
allowed
to
examine
how
the
instruction
affected
the
outcome
of
the
case.
if
the
appellate
court
could
conclude
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
is
no
reasonable
possibility
that
a
rationale
trier
of
fact
could
have
entertained
a
reasonable
doubt
about
intent,
so
that
the
instruction
resulted
in
a
conviction
where
there
otherwise
would
have
been
an
acquittal,
then,
despite
the
finding
of
sandstrom
error--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--that's
not
precisely
the
analysis
that--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--not
exactly,
your
honor,
because--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--what
an
appellate
court--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--i
think
that
the
word
"conclusive"
had
to
be
viewed
particularly
in
this
case
in
context.
i
think
what
the
jury
in
this
case
would
have
heard
are
the
following
things.
in...
questions
of
facts--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--to
reach
a
conclusion,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
to
reach
a
conclusion.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
well,
that
is
not
exactly
what
the
jury
in
this
case
was
told.
the
jury
in
this
case
was
told
that
intent
was
a
question
of
fact,
that
they
were
the
fact
finders,
that
the
prosecution
bore
the
burden
of
proving
intent
among
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
jury
was
to
examine
and
assess
the
credibility
of
the
victim,
who
was
the
only
one
to
supply
direct
evidence
of
the
acts
of
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
that
the
jury
was
then
to
assess
all
of
the
objective
facts
concerning
the
circumstances,
such
as
the
time
of
day...
it
was
4:00
in
the
morning...
such
as
the
temperature...
it
was
ten
degrees
below
zero...
such
as
the
fact
that
the
victim
unequivocally
identified
the
defendant,
such
as
the
fact
that
the
jury
never
came
back
in
this
case
and
asked
for
reinstruction
on
either
the
attempted
murder
or
the
robbery
charges,
such
as
the
fact
that
the
defense
counsel
never
objected
to
the
instruction
that
was
given,
that
the
issue
of
the
defendant's
intent
was
not
closely
disputed
or
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
the
theory
of
the
defense
did
not
really
in
any
way
involve
either
the
attempted
murder
or
the
robbery
charges.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
well,
at
the
time
that
that
instruction
was
given,
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
court
since
the
sandstrom
decision
would
give
that
instruction,
it
had
been
a
recognized
statement
of
what
i
would
like
to
describe
as
the
standardized
inference
of
intent,
proving
intent
from
an
accused
conduct.
it
is
pretty
clear
that
in
most
cases,
we
don't
have
the
hypothetical
situation
where
the
accused
comes
in
and
says,
i
did
it,
except,
for
example,
in
a
case...
and
that
i
intended
to
do
it.
you
may
have
a
case
like
sandstrom
itself
where
the
accused
admitted
his
act
but
hotly
contested
the
fact
that
he
could
form
the
specific
intent.
therefore,
i
don't
think
the
judge
could
be
faulted
for
giving
this
instruction,
given
the
state
of
the
law,
and
that
there
is
really
a
very
limited
salutary
effect
in
an
automatic
reversal
rule
in
this
type
of
a
case.
indeed,
it
would
probably
be...
the
more
likely
effect
would
be
probably
be
for
the
public
confidence
in
the
administration
of
justice
to
be
undermined
when
the
general
public
hears
that
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
a
case
such
as
this
one,
a
new
trial
has
been
ordered
on
the
attempted
murder
and
the
robbery
counts.
even
if
we
assume
that
the
jury
followed
the
presumption,
the
question
is
also
what
in
fact
would
this
jury
have
done
that
would
have
been
any
different--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--well,
i
think
that--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--i
think
that
in
fact
an
appellate
court--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--i
think
that--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--well,
i've
never
been
on
a
jury
either,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
but
i
think
that
appellate
courts
accepting
and
in
fact
sanctioning
a
standardized
inference
of
intent
understand
what
jurors
do
when
they
attempt
to
find
intent.
what
they
do
is,
they
look
at
the
evidence
to
see
what
acts
and
conduct
have
been
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
they
assess
credibility
and
perform
the
other
functions
that
jurors
do.
they
then
look
to
the
evidence
to
see
the
natural
and
necessary
consequences
of
those
acts
under
the
attendant
circumstances
that
are
established
by
the
evidence.
they
then
ask
themselves,
has
any
countervailing
evidence
been
introduced
in
this
case
which
raises
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
is,
a
doubt
based
on
reason,
not
a
speculative
doubt,
about
the
defendant's
intent,
and
then
they
reason
from
all
of
the
above
to
find
that
intent
has
been
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
in
fact
the
reasoning
process
that
this
jury
engaged
in,
assuming
they
followed
the
charge
in
this
case,
had
to
be
that
process,
because
that's
what
they
were
told
to
do
specifically
in
the
attempted
murder
instructions.
they
were
told
to
examine
all
of
the
circumstances,
to
assess
credibility,
to
draw
inferences.
furthermore,
they
were
told,
properly
instructed
on
the
kidnapping
charge
on
how
to
draw
an
inference
of
intent
from
conduct,
and
the
only
reinstruction
that
the
jury
heard
on
the
issue
of
intent
was
a
reinstruction
on
the
kidnapping
charge.

the
respondent
is
incarcerated
on
the
kidnapping
and
sexual
assault
convictions.

he
is
serving
now
as
a
result
of
the
reversal
an
18
to
36
year
sentence.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
the
consequence
of
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut's
decision
is
that
the
state
is
now
obliged
to
conduct
a
second
trial
of
the
attempted
murder
and
the
robbery
convictions,
bring
this
victim
back
in
after
seven
years
of
the
incident
to
repeat
the
details
of
the
story,
establish
the
same
case.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
he
got
a...
the
consequence
of
the
reversal
was
that
the
minimum
sentence
was
reduced
by
ten
years,
and
the
maximum
sentence
was
reduced
by
20
years.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
he
got
a
28
to
56
year
sentence
originally.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
an
18
to
36
year
sentence.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
why
must
the
state
reprosecute?
ms.
linda
k.
lager
the
state's
position
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
is
that
the
gravity
of
the
offense
is
so
serious
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
reprosecute
the
defendant.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
it
is
a
matter
of
prosecutorial
discretion.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
it
does
not
have
to,
but
as
the
case
stands
now,
it
is
in
a
posture
of
having
a
retrial
on
the
two
counts
that
were
ordered
to
be
retried.
i
would
like
to
reserve--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--twenty-eight
to
56
under
the
original
sentence.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
that
is
correct.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
if
i
may
have
a
moment.
0....
ms.
linda
k.
lager
if
you
look
at
pages
51a
and
52a
of
the
appendix--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--that
would
give
the
sentence.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
the
concurrent
sentence
doctrine
that
was
raised
by
mr.
barnett,
the
sentences,
in
response
to
your
question
earlier,
mr.
chief
justice,
were
10
to
20
years
on
the
attempted
murder
count,
8
to
16
years
on
the
kidnapping
count,
10
to
20
years
on
sexual
assault,
and
5
to
10
years
on
the
robbery,
which
was
concurrent
with
the
kidnapping
offense.
the
effect
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court's
reversal
is
that
the
the
state
of
connecticut
is
obliged
to
retry
the
defendant
on
both
the
robbery
and
the
attempted
murder
counts.
ms.
linda
k.
lager
or
can
exercise
its
prosecutorial
discretion.
as
it
stands
now,
the--
ms.
linda
k.
lager
--if
it
does
not,
the
respondent
has
18
to
36.
but
there
is
certainly
no
question
of
mootness
with
respect
to
the
the
state
of
connecticut,
who
is
the
petitioner
today,
and
the
consequences
to
the
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
as
far
as
the
reversal
of
the
defendant's
conviction
on
those
charges,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
sentence
was
concurrent.
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
harmfulness
of
an
error
should
not
depend
on
an
absolute
rule
concerning
the
point
in
a
trial
where
the
error
occurred.
an
evidentiary
error
may
be
devastating,
and
an
instructional
error
may
be
insubstantial
or
insignificant.
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
announced
a
harmless-error
rule
and
why
it
should
be
appropriately
applied
in
the
proper
case
under
the
correct
circumstances.
thank
you.
