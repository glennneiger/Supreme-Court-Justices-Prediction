r.

do
you
think
it
is
always
improper
for
an
appellate
court
to
say
what
the
jury
might
have
done
under
other
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
an
evidentiary
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
which
the
jury
is
told,
you
consider
all
the
evidence;
and
the
jury
considers
all
the
evidence.
and
then
some
evidence
is
found
to
have
been
improperly
admitted,
and
the
court
finds
harmless
error
on
the
grounds
the
jury
would
have
come
out
that
way
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
unless
the
appellate
court
is
coming
to
a
conclusion
as
to
what
the
jury
would
have
done
absent
the
evidence
or
with
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
it's
performing
in
a
way
a
jury
function.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
certitude
based
on
the
evidence
that
the
jury
couldn't
possibly
have
found
anything
but
that
the
defendant
intended
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
just
told
us
we
should
assume
the
jury's
followed
instructions.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
jury,
you
say
the
appellate
court
is
foreclosed
from
saying,
if
the
jury
had
been
properly
instructed,
it
would
have
found
him
guilty
anyway
because
it
couldn't
have
done
anything
but
found
that
he
intended
what
he
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
can't
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
affected
the
verdict.
