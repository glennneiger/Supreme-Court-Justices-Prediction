we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
connecticut
against
johnson.
ms.
lager,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
drew
back
from
that
instruction
in
the
latter
part,
did
he
not,
where
he
said,
"if
you
believe
the
victim's
version
as
to
the
defendant's
conduct
at
the
bridge,
you
may
presume
he
intended
what
would
be
the
natural
and
necessary
consequences
of
his
actions.
"
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
court's
opinion,
that
discussion
relates
only
to
the
first
count
of
attempted
murder.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did
not
discuss
that,
as
i
recall
it,
in
the
counts
on
kidnapping
and
robbery.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
have
those
figures
again.
you
said
18
to
36
under
the
adjusted
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
down
to
18
to
36,
you
said.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
on
the
assault
charge,
what
was
the
sentence
on
that?
and
were
they
consecutive
or--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--well,
if
it
takes
time,
don't
use
the
time
now.
i
can
check
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
the
word
"conclusive".
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
not
sure
i
understood
the
state's
position
just
as
you
have
stated
it.
i
thought
the
state's
position
was
that
taking
the
record
as
a
whole,
that
is,
the
instruction
as
a
whole,
that
there
was
sufficient
ambiguity
to
afford
a
basis
for
a
harmless
error
holding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
this
kind
of
an
instruction,
is
it
your
position
that
no
amount
of
evidence,
no
matter
how
overwhelming,
could
permit
a
reviewing
court
to
say
that
it
was
harmless
error?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
a
reviewing
court
would
say
that
no
rational
mind
could
have
been
misled
by
the
ambiguity
in
the
instruction
in
the
light
of
the
overwhelming
evidence?
you
would
maintain
that
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
leave
much
left
to
the
harmless
error
rule,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven't
said
very
much
about
the
failure
to
object
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
whole
purpose
of
objections
is
to
give
the
trial
in
the
courts
an
opportunity
to
correct
an
asserted
error,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
ms.
lager,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
blackmun.
