justice

marshall
could
i
put
it
another
way,
that
the
only
way
to
be
successful
is
that
the
appellant
has
to
first
show,
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
is
a
violation
of
sandstrom,
and
secondly,
he
must
show
that
there
is
not
harmless
error.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
you
assume
that
you
put
yourself
in
the
position
of
a
juror
who
is
told
about
this
conclusive
presumption.
and
it
has
no
effect
on
him
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
close,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
get
at
the
word
"conclusive"?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
think
"conclusive"
means
to
the
average
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was
very
simple.
what
does
the
word
by
itself,
"conclusive",
mean
to
the
average
person?
justice
thurgood
marshall
reasonable
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
you
reach
a
conclusion
as
to
a
presumption
that
is...
oh,
yes,
you
reach
a
position
he
is
guilty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
after
all
of
that,
why
did
you
need
the
presumption
instruction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
you
and
i
are
in
the
same
position.
we
don't
know
because
we
were
never
on
a
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
i've
never
been
on
a
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i've
never
been
in
a
jury
room.
