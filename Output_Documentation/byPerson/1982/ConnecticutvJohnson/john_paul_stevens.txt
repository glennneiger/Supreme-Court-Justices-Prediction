justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
are
going
to
argue
that
the
error
was
harmless,
i
think,
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
to
that,
i
am
not
quite
clear
on
your
position
with
respect
to
when
the
harmless
error
argument
should
be
made
in
connecticut.
in
the
state
against
truppi,
the
court
had
an
opinion
in
which
it
discussed
that
it
would
sometimes
entertain
a
harmless
error
challenge
and
sometimes
it
would
not.
now,
if
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
practice
the
connecticut
supreme
court
should
decide,
well,
sandstrom
errors
are
going
to
give
rise
to
automatic
reversal,
would
we
have
power
to
tell
it
it
could
not
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
cite
state
against
zeco,
which
is
a
connecticut
case,
state
against
sorbo,
a
connecticut
case,
elman
against
state,
a
connecticut
case,
state
against
briggs,
a
connecticut
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
what
your
explanation
of
what
the
state
of
connecticut's
position
is
on
harmless
error
on
this
issue.
does
the
court
sometimes
review
it
and
sometimes
not
review
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
that
mean...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
follow
what
you
are
explaining
to
me.
does
that
mean
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
practice
sometimes
entertains
the
challenge
to
instructions
and
sometimes
does
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
your
position
that
they
must
apply
it
in
every
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
state
it
to
be
sure
i
understand
it
correctly.
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
a
state
supreme
court
must
entertain
a
harmless...
must
make
a
harmless
error
examination
every
time
the
prosecutor
asks
it
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
barnett,
may
i
just
ask
you
what
your
understanding
of
the
holding
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court
was?
i
don't
read
in
their
opinion
the
same
theory
of
defending
this
judgment
that
you
advance
in
argument
today.
they
don't
say
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
still
not
sure
i
understand.
does
that
mean
in
your
view
that
they
have
taken
a
position
that
as
a
matter
of
connecticut
practice
they
will
always
consider
a
sandstrom
error
to
be
not
subject
to
harmless
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
all
right.
so
you
are
over
the
wainwright
against
sykes
problem,
you
have
got
the
error
before
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut.
when,
if
ever,
will
they
allow
the
prosecutor
to
say,
well,
granting
there
was
sandstrom
error,
nevertheless
it
was
harmless
because
we
look
at
the
entire
record.
have
they
passed
on
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
do
you
understand
them
to
have
done
in
this
case
as
a
reason
for
rejecting
the
prosecutor's
argument
that
this
error
was
harmless?
why
did
they
reject
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
doesn't
really
meet
the
argument
that
the
prosecutor
makes
that
it
could
also
be
cured
by
the
abundant
evidence
of
guilt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
they
don't
really
deal
with
that
argument,
do
they?
