ms.
lager,
before
you
go
on,
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
23a
and
25a?
was
it
used
in
respect
of
only
one
of
these
offenses,
or
all
of
them?
and
if
less
than
all,
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
would
cover
all
of
the
offenses
charged.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
being
the
charge
of
attempted
murder?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
where
the
25a?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
the
respondent
is
now
incarcerated
on
what
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
are
his
sentences?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
the
consequence
of
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut's
decision
is
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
sentences
did
he
get
on
those
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
had--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--twenty-eight
to
56,
and
he
is
now
serving
a--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
the
one
at
page
23a?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
barnett,
i
gather,
or
do
i,
that
you
think
that
an
examination
of
the
evidence
is
irrelevant
to
the
determination
of
the
issue
we
have
to
decide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
you
suggest
that
we
have
never
treated
for
harmless
error
purposes
instructional
error?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
it
is
irreparable
other
than
by
better
instructions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
in
this
case,
mr.
barnett,
i
appreciate
that
argument
as
to
the
attempted
murder,
where
twice
"conclusive"
was
used,
but
how
do
you
carry
this
as
instructional
error
into
the
other
convictions--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
on
parole?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
another
one?
that's
the
robbery.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
barnett,
do
you
concede
that
the
instruction
in
this
case
was
ambiguous?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
still
had
to
find
the
other
elements,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
connecticut
supreme
court
practice,
or
at
least
that's
what
happened
here,
was
that
notwithstanding
the
failure
to
object--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--they
were
willing
to
entertain
the--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--and
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
it
does
not,
the
respondent
has
15
to
36,
is
that
right?
