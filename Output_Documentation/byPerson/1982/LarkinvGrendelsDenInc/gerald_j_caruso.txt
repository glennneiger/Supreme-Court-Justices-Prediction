mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
a
question
concerning
the
state's
power
to
regulate
alcoholic
beverages.
the
state
law
at
issue
is
massachusetts
general
law,
chapter
138,
section
16(c).
that
statute
prohibits
the
issuance
of
a
liquor
license
to
any
establishment
located
within
500
feet
of
a
church
or
school
if
the
church
or
school
objects
to
the
issuance
of
the
license.
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
addressed
the
issues
presented
here
and
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
concurred
in
that
ruling,
but
reversed
itself
in
an
en
banc
decision
which
is
now
the
subject
of
this
appeal.
the
first
circuit
ruled
that
section
16(c)
violates
the
establishment
clause.
in
the
first
circuit's
view,
the
statute
has
the
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion
because
it
extends
to
churches
but
not
to
all
similarly
situated
institutions
a
more
than
de
minimis
benefit.
in
defense
of
the
en
banc
decision,
grendel's
advances
an
alternative
rationale.
in
grendel's
view,
the
statute
improperly
delegates
legislative
power
to
churches
and
thereby
violates
the
establishment
clause.
the
state
contends
that
section
16(c)
embodies
a
legislative
effort
to
accommodate
competing
interests
and
to
control
the
placement
of
liquor
licenses
in
massachusetts.
we
also
contend--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--yes.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
sure.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes.
there
were
three
claims
that
went
up
on
appeal.
initially,
the
case
was
brought
as
applied
and
facially,
i
might
point
out.
when
it
was
filed
in
the
district
court,
it
was
filed
both
as
an
as
applied
attack
to
the
challenge
and
a
facial
challenge
to
the
statute.
the
district
court,
after
grendel's...
the
commonwealth
moved
to
dismiss
and
asked
the
district
court
to
abstain
on
the
as
applied
section
of
the
complaint,
the
district
court
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss,
we
then
entered
into
an
agreement
of
facts
and
contested
claims
with
grendel's.
those
claims
were
due
process,
establishment
clause,
and
equal
protection,
and
the
sherman
act
claim.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
all
of
that
went
up
to
the
first
circuit.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
well,
insofar
as
the
statutory
claim
was
the
supremacy
clause
claim
under
the
antitrust
laws,
your
honor,
i
think
the
first
circuit...
i
don't
know
why
the
first
circuit
chose
to
proceed
the
way
it
did
on
the
en
banc
review.
if
the
statutory
claim
was
the
antitrust
action
that
your
honor
is
concerned
about,
that
we
look
at
as
a
supremacy
clause
claim,
on
whether
the
statute
should
be
struck
down
under
the
supremacy
clause.
that
was
the
basis
of
grendel's's
claim.
we
defended
against
that
prior
to
the
rice
decision
coming
down,
we
defended
against
that
by
claiming
that
the
sherman
state
action
exemption
applied.
the
district
court
disagreed
with
that.
i
don't
know
if
i
answered
your
question.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes.
the
antitrust
claim
is,
as
well
as
the
as
applied
claim.
those
two
claims
lay
back
in
the
district
court
ready
for
further
adjudication.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
i
should--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--i
should
also
add,
your
honor,
that
the
original
panel
of
the
first
circuit
did
address
that
claim.
judge
campbell
in
his
decision
upheld
the
district
court's
action
holding,
saying
that
the
sherman...
the
state
action
exemption
did
not
apply.
the
en
banc
panel
did
not
address
it.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
that's
what
the
court
said
in
essence,
yes.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
well,
the
first
circuit,
as
you
know,
your
honor,
consists
of
four
judges.
the
original
panel
was
made
up
of
judge
campbell,
judge
coffin,
and
judge
hoffman
out
of
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
right.
now,
when
grendel's
applied
for
a
rehearing
en
banc,
petitioned
for
a
rehearing
en
banc,
judge
breyer
recused
himself
because
of
my
brother's
participation
in
the
case.
judge
breyer
taught
at
harvard
as
well.
so
that
left
judge
barnes,
judge
coffin
and
judge
campbell.
they
all
voted
to
grant
rehearing
en
banc.
so
it
was
the
difference
of
one
judge
that
changed
the
constitutional
issues
here,
results.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
well,
i
think
insofar
as
grendel's
was
challenging
our
statute
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
essentially
claiming
that
the
federal
court
should
strike
down
the
statute
because
it
violated
the
antitrust
laws,
i
frankly,
after
this
court's
decision
in
rice
v.
norman
williams,
don't
think
that
grendel's
claim
is
going
to
prevail
there.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
it
is
another
constitutional
issue
and
it
is
somewhere
in
this
proceeding
that
we
engage
in.
we
think
it's
back
in
the
district
court.
of
course,
if
this
court
chose
to
uphold
the
en
banc
panel's
decision,
all
that
would
be
for
nought
anyway.
the
state
contends,
as
i
said,
that
the
statute
embodies
a
legislative
effort
to
accommodate
competing
interests
and
to
control
the
location
of
liquor
licenses
in
massachusetts.
we
also
contend
that
the
statute
is
well
within
our
broad
twenty-first
amendment
police
powers,
and
it
neither
advances
religion
nor
creates
an
excessive
entanglement
with
religion.
after
briefly
discussing
the
facts,
we
will
direct
our
argument
to
three
main
points:
first,
the
statute
gives
to
churches
only
an
incidental
benefit,
which
does
not
advance
religion;
second,
the
failure
of
the
statute
to
include
all
institutions
similar
to
churches
and
schools
does
not
violate
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
that's
the
final
argument.
we
will
argue
that
section
16(c)
does
not
delegate
legislative
power
to
churches
or
schools.
it
simply
permits
them
to
waive
an
otherwise
applicable
zoning
prohibition
on
the
placement
of
liquor
licenses.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
i
would
not
buy
that,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
well,
your
honor,
here
this
statute
represents
the
legislature's
judgment
of
the
public
interest.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
no,
your
honor.
in
that
case
the
legislature
really--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--the
state
legislature
has
given
to
churches
in
that
case,
or
private
persons
for
that
matter,
anyone,
the
power
to
decide
and
not
decide
whether
or
not
a
liquor
license
should
issue.
that
is
substantially
different
from
this
case.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
here
the
statute
reads
that
no
premises
shall
be
licensed
if
the
governing
body
of
the
church
objects.
here
there
is
a
legislative
prohibition
which
can
be
waived.
it's
a
legislative
protection
for
churches
and
schools,
which
can
be
waived.
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
dispute
between
the
parties,
laws
which
permit
individuals
to
waive
otherwise
applicable
zoning
prohibitions
do
not
delegate--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
and
i
may
not,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
statute
in
the
context
of
its
historical
development,
you
get
a
better
flavor
for
what
the
legislature
is
promoting
here.
the
statute
was
initially
active
as
a
flat
ban.
it
totally
prohibited
liquor
licenses
from
being
issued
within
500
feet
of
a
church
or
school.
subsequently
the
legislature
amended
the
statute
and
permitted
the
issuance
of
a
liquor
license,
but
the
license
applicant
had
to
go
to
the
church
and
school
and
solicit
the
assent
of
the
church
or
school.
finally,
in
1970
the
legislature
amended
the
statute
further
and
permitted
liquor
licenses...
or
relieved
the
applicant
from
soliciting
the
assent
of
churches
and
schools,
and
placed
the
burden
of
objection
on
the
protected
institutions.
so
you
see,
your
honor,
what
the
legislature
has
done
here
is,
the
legislature
has
decided
that
churches
and
schools
shall
be
protected
with
what
we
might
call
a
zone
of
tranquility,
but
the
legislature
has
also
determined
that
if
a
church
or
school
does
not
have
any
objection
to
a
liquor
license
being
within
its
500-foot
zone
of
tranquility
that
the
legislature
is
not
going
to
prohibit
the
license
from
being
there
any
more.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
your
honor,
there's
approximately
26
licensees
in
this
zone.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
well,
your
honor,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
twofold.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
protect
churches
and
schools
from
liquor
license
establishments
and
the
noise
and
dirt
and
abuse--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--well,
yes,
your
honor,
only
in
this
extent.
the
second
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
help
facilitate
the
issuance
of
liquor
licenses.
in
1954
when
the
statute
was
first
passed,
there
were
no
liquor
licenses
in
harvard
square
in
500
feet
of
whatever
church
existed
there.
today
the
legislature--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--only
to
the
extent--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--i
think
they
are
functionally
equivalent,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
your
honor,
only
to
the
extent
that
the
legislature
now
does
not
now--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--no,
i
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
the
legislative
policy
remains
the
same.
simply--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--well,
the
legislature
i
think
now
believes
that
if
a
church
does
not
have...
a
church
may
not
object
to
one,
to
a
liquor
license,
especially
in
a
congested
area
like
harvard
square,
that's
around
the
corner
and
up
the
street.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
i
think
if
the
legislature
had
that
policy
it
would
have.
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
happened
here,
and
that's
why
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
as
it
went
through
the
history
determined
that
the
legislature...
the
legislature's
policy
remained
essentially
the
same.
i
also
might
point
out,
your
honor,
that
here
we're
dealing
with
a
statewide
statute.
the
statute
applies
not
only
to
the
harvard
square
area
of
cambridge,
massachusetts,
but
it
also
applies
to
the
berkshire
hills
and
the
cape
cod
and
the
islands
off
massachusetts.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
that
is--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--that
is
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
we
would
argue,
your
honor...
and
this
was
why
we
asked
that
the
district
court
abstain
in
this
case.
we
would
argue
that
in
that
case
the
person
could
seek
relief,
administrative
or
judicial,
from
the
operation
of
the
statute.
we
believe
that
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
and
the
abcc
will
read
into
any
improper
motives...
will
not
permit
improper
motives
in
a
pleaded
and
proved
case.
this
one
here
is
a
facial
challenge.
and
it
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
the
massachusetts
legislature
does
not
require
a
reason
by
the
church.
however,
the
reason
is
presumed.
the
presumption
is
that
the
church
is
objecting
for
legitimate
police
and
safety
and
health
requirements.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
if
the
church?
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
i
would
rely
back
on
my--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--sure.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
i
would
fall
back
on
my
position,
your
honor,
that
that
case--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--the
option,
your
honor,
was
that
you
couldn't
do
business
in
that
zone
of
protection
at
all
because
there
was
a
legislative
prohibition.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
what
the
legislature
has
done--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--no,
you
don't,
your
honor.
if
you
want
to
open
up
a
bar
and
a
grill
near
a
church--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--the
legislature
has
decided
that
that
is
not
a
suitable
site.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
i
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
i
think
the
legislature
has
determined
that
in
proximity
of
a
church
or
a
school
is
not
a
suitable
site
for
liquor
establishments
unless
there's
no
good
reason
why
the
liquor
establishment
shouldn't
be
developed
there.
we're
talking
about
geographic
locations,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
you
can
apply
for
a
liquor
license,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
if
the
church
objects,
you
would
not
get
it.
unless
the
church
objected--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
well,
your
honor,
once
the
site
is
established
as
being
suitable,
then
the
state
remains
the
official
determining
body
as
to
whether
or
not
the
liquor
license
would
issue.
the
church
is
merely
given
an
opportunity
to
waive
a
legislative
prohibition.
and
the
statute,
your
honors,
has
to
be
viewed
against
the
background,
the
traditional
background
in
this
country,
of
permitting
abutters
to
waive
legislative
zoning
protections.
it
must
be
viewed
in
that--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--no,
your
honor.
there
are
some
that
were
licensed
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
statute.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
in
1954.
some
of
them
were
licensed
between
1954
and
1968,
which
means
that
the
church
mustn't
have
been
there.
and
then
others
were
licensed
after.
there
were
14
that
were
licensed
after
the
church.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
en
banc
panel's
decision
would--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--right,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
very
next
sentence,
the
court
cited
to
the
cusack
case,
which
was
a
case
earlier--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--it's
very
difficult
to
say
what
the
en
banc
panel
was
doing,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
en
banc
panel
said
that
if
you
give
any
benefit
to
a
church
and
do
not
include
enough
other
institutions,
even
a
zoning
benefit,
then
that
zoning
benefit
will
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
right,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
en
banc
panel's
decision
was
much
too
broad.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
under
the
en
banc
panel
decision,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
under
the
en
banc
panel
decision
those
flat
bans
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
well,
in
many
states...
every
single
court
decision
that
we
have
found
has
upheld
this
type
of
statute.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
including
the
flat
bans
and
the
consent
provisions.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
state
courts.
it's
never
been...
well,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
in
big
sandy
versus
city
of--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
your
honor,
i've
never
been
to
new
orleans,
so
i
defer
to
your
knowledge
on
that.
[laughter]
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
they
have,
your
honor,
consistently
on
establishment
clause
grounds.
i
should
say,
even
when
there's
a
consent
provision
the
attacks
have
been
on
both
establishment
clause
and
delegation
issues.
mostly,
the
bans
have
been
presumed,
i
think
we
can
fairly
say,
constitutional.
all
commenters,
all
textbooks
and
am.
jur.
they
all
assume
that
these
flat
bans
are
constitutional,
even
thoughthey
don't
contain
enough
other
types
of
institutions.
and
i
might
say,
your
honors,
that
with
regard
to
the
consent
mechanism
the
cases
seem
to
indicate
that
when
the
use
is
offensive
then
they
don't...
they
permit
these
types
of
consent
mechanisms
when
the
use
is
an
offensive
use
or
viewed
as
an
offensive
use.
and
you
won't
find
many
cases
striking
down
these
consent
provisions
dealing
with
liquor
establishments.
however,
when
the
use
is
one
which
is
not
considered
offensive
or
would
interfere
with
somebody
else's
property,
those
consent
mechanisms
are
usually
struck
down.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
we
do,
your
honor.
in
our
view...
and
in
our
brief
we
argue
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
of
course
gives
us
broad
power
to
determine
where
in
our
commonwealth
liquor
will
be
distributed,
and
that
we
have--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--no.
if
there
were
an
establishment
clause
problem,
your
honor,
we
would
not
defend
against
it
with
the
twenty-first
amendment.
but
we
do
believe
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
this
case
permits
us
to
act
in
this
way.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
but
usually
these
cases
are
as
applied
cases.
this
one
here
is
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
it
was
stipulated
as
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
we
do
know
what
the
facts
are,
only
to
the
extent
that
there
are
other
liquor
establishments
in
the
area.
but
most
of
these
other
cases--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--right,
your
honor.
that
would
be
the
effect.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
that's
the
facial
challenge.
it's
not
just
applicable
to
grendel's
here.
it's
a
statewide
challenge
to
our
licensing
procedure.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
well,
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--well,
your
honor,
if
you
want
to
remand
it
back
and
let
us
have
a
trial
on
the
as
applied
claims
grendel's
makes,
the
commonwealth
may
be
willing
to
do
that.
but
we
entered
into
the
stipulation
believing
that
there
would
be
a
presumption--
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
--we
asked
the
district
court
to
abstain,
your
honor,
from
the
as
applied.
mr.
gerald
j.
caruso
following
the
motion
to...
the
denial
of
our
motion
to
dismiss,
we
viewed
it
as
we
had
no
opportunity
to
get
those
as
applied
claims
back
into
the
state
court,
to
see.
i
also
asked
the
district
court
to
certify
a
question
over
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
we
believed
that
we
would
stand
a
better...
we
would
not
want
the
federal
court
to
decide
the
as
applied
claim
prior
to
a
state
court
looking
at
the
issue.
i
would
like
to
save
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
i
could.
i
thank
you.
