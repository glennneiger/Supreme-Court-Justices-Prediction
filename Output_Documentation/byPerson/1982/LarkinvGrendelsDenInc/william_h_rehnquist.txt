mr.
caruso.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
procedure
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals
before
you
get
anymore
deeply
into
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
it,
the
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
here,
asserted
a
couple
of
constitutional
claims
and
a
statutory
antitrust
claim
in
the
district
court,
did
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
all
of
those
went
up
on
appeal
to
the
first
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
all
of
those--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
in
view
of
all
of
our
talking
in
our
opinions
about
how
at
least
this
court,
and
i
think
we've
said
other
federal
courts
too,
should
first
address
statutory
claims
before
they
reach
constitutional
claims,
isn't
it
a
little
odd
that
the
first
circuit
addressed
constitutional
claims
and
didn't
resolve
the
statutory
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
antitrust
claim
is
still
a
live
one
as
between
these
two
parties,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
wasn't
as
if
the
antitrust
claim
hadn't
been
appealed
to
the
first
circuit.
the
first
circuit
had
it
before
it
and
simply
chose
not
to
address
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
to
dispose
of
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
first
circuit
said
first
of
all
that
you
weren't
entitled
to
summary
judgment
on
your
antitrust
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
the
consent
issue
made
pretty
much
irrelevant
by
cases
like
new
motor
vehicle
board
of
california
v.
orrin
fox,
where
the
court
says
that
almost
any
system
of
private
or
quasi-private
law
could
be
subject
to
the
same
objection?
court
approval
of
an
eviction,
for
example,
becomes
necessary
only
when
the
tenant
protests
his
eviction,
and
he
alone
decides
whether
he'll
protest.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that's
a
permissible
posture
under
our
cases,
to
say
that
we
have
a
statutory
claim
here
but
we're
not
going
to
press
it
right
now,
we're
going
to
press
our
constitutional
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
find
any
authority
in
our
cases
for
saying
that
in
those
circumstances
you
take
the
constitutional
claim
before
you
take
the
statutory
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
only
that's
administrative
assessment.
you're
talking
about
judicial
assessment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
a
distraction
largely
because
you've
made
it
one,
i
think.
the
united
states
attorney
could
certainly
file
a
criminal
action
based
on
these
same
allegations
of
antitrust
claims,
and
i
can't
imagine
any
serious
constitutional
objection
to
that
case
being
tried
on
the
facts
that
were
developed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
statutory
claim
in
each
of
those
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
choice
between
two
constitutional
grounds,
at
any
rate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
concede
that
a
flat
ban
was
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
wasn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
reason
you
have
a
crazy-quilt
in
harvard
square...
we
don't
have
any
information
about
whether
or
not
there
are
crazy-quilts
in
the
other
parts
of
massachusetts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
crazy
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
not
only
look
old,
but
they've
been
scarcely
ever
cited
since
they've
been
decided.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
once.
