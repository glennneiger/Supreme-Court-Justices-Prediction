how
can
you
call
it
a
zone
of
tranquility
with
14
licensees
in
the
zone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
call
it
a
zone
of
tranquility?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
soon
as
one
is
established,
why,
that
purpose
has
been
frustrated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
there's
been
a
change
in
legislative
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
earlier
seemed
to
be
arguing
that
the
three
statutes
were
functionally
equivalent.
i
think
now
you're
saying
they're
quite
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
hasn't
there
been
a
change
in
policy
from
one
that
said
you
can't
have
any
to
one
that
says
you
can
have
26?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
legislature
says,
we
don't
care,
but
if
the
church
cares
it
can't
open.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
as
when
it
prohibited
them
entirely?
how
can
that
be
the
same
as
having
26?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
but
if
you
phrase
it
in
terms
of
the
church
objecting,
then
you're
saying
the
legislature
doesn't
have
its
own
policy.
it
says,
we'll
let
the
church
decide
what
it
wants,
and
that's
a
pure
delegation,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
you
mentioned
cases
holding
that
a
consent
mechanism
is
permissible
if
the
use
is
an
offensive
use.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
some
of
those
cases...
do
they
sustain
a
consent
mechanism
where
there
have
been
some
offensive
uses
within
the
area
and
then
they
have
been
permitted
to
object
to
an
additional
offensive
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
stipulated,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
it
also
stipulated
there
are
a
lot
of
other
taverns
in
the
area?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
do
know
what
the
facts
are.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
the
sherman
act
applies
there
isn't
any
constitutional
issue
remaining.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
then
the
supremacy
clause
requires
that
it
be
enforced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
doctrine
of
avoiding
constitutional
issues
would
be
served
by
addressing
the
sherman
act
claim
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
won
on
the
sherman
act
claim
we
would
avoid
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
did
you
allege
a
conspiracy
between
the
church
and
the
other
licensees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
hold
you
up,
because
i'm
not
really
familiar
with
the
details
of
the
allegation.
does
the
complaint
filed
by
counsel
for
your
client
allege
a
conspiracy
between
the
archbishop
or
the
priest
or
whatever
he
is
and
the
licensees
in
that
community?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
if
it
is
so
alleged,
why
shouldn't
that
case
be
tried?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
must
have
that
evidence
if
you
made
that
allegation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
that's
not
a
fair
reading
of
your
complaint.
in
paragraph
12
you
allege
on
information
and
belief
that
certain
congregation
members,
because
of
their
contributions
to
the
parish
or
otherwise,
exerted
substantial
influence
on
the
governing
board
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
competition.
and
that's
a
factual
allegation,
and
i
certainly
don't
see
any
establishment
clause
problem
in
putting
on
the
witness
stand
some
licensee
and
asking
him
if
he
did
that.
what's
the...
and
you
say
that's
more
sensitive
constitutionally
than
reaching
the
ultimate
constitutional
issue
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
those
allegations
talk
about
the
other
conspirators
and
their
contributions
and
their
attempt
to
influence
the
church;
you
say
you
couldn't
try
to
prove
that
without--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
say
there
are
greater
constitutional
issues
at
stake
there
than
deciding
the
ultimate
issue
on
the
merits
here,
that's
what
you're
saying.
well,
mr.
tribe,
the
only
relief
you
ask
is
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
this
statute.
you
didn't
ask
for
any
injunction
against
violating
the
sherman
act
or
any
damages
for
sherman
act
violation.
the
only
time
you
mention
the
sherman
act
is
in
paragraph
20,
where
you
say
that
it
preempts
the
operation
of
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
more,
you
do
allege
private
agreements,
as
well
as
just
the
facial
effect
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
disagree
with
justice
white's
last
comment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
referring
to
paragraph
12
of
the
complaint,
as
well
as
paragraph
20.
justice
john
paul
stevens
20
refers
back
to
the
private
agreements
alleged
in
12.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
it
violate
the
establishment
clause?
why
did
you
deny
this
okay
for
this
liquor
license?
because...
the
answer
would
either
be,
because
we
were
persuaded
by
our
contributors
or,
alternatively,
because
we
didn't
like
all
the
drinking
in
the
neighborhood.
i
don't
know
what
the
religious
issue
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
i'm
embarrassed
that
i
haven't
examined
the
sherman
act
claim
more
closely
before.
but
am
i
correct
in
noting
that
you
didn't
sue
any
of
the
alleged
conspirators?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
rather
strange
sherman
act
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
if
you
don't
rely
on
the
flat
ban
analogy,
then
your
delegation
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
equally
strong
if
the
power
to
veto
were
given,
say,
to
a
bank
or
to
the
largest
tavern
in
the
neighborhood.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
mr.
tribe,
would
you
suggest
this
statute
could
be
cured
by
allowing
the
veto,
but
it
be
exercised
by
a
vote
among
the
26
existing
tavern
owners?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
26
tavern
owners
are
the
people
allowed
to
vote
in
the
referendum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wouldn't
think
so.
