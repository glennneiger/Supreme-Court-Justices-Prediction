but
in
any
even
it's
another
constitutional
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
held
that
a
flat
ban
within
500
feet
of
any
liquor
establishments
would
be
unconstitutional
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
make
the
consent
issue
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
opinion
below
also
seems
to
me
to
read
that
even
if
a
flat
ban
would
be
sustainable,
this
conditional...
or
this
consent,
the
consent
provision,
renders
it
unconstitutional.
do
you
think
it's
sort
of
an
alternative
holding?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
getting
a
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
was
asking.
they
would
invalidate
that
too,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
under
the
decision
the
consent
mechanism
is
invalidated
statewide
in
all
situations.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
facial
challenge.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we
need
to
be
stuck
with
a
stipulation
about
some
facial
challenge?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
that's
just
making
it
a
broader
constitutional
decision
than
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
the
district
court
be
forced
to
make
a
facial...
to
answer
a
facial
challenge
just
by
a
stipulation,
if
it
would
be
a
much
narrower
decision
if
decided
as
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
stipulated
that
it
was
a
facial--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
still
a
supremacy
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
used
to
make
a
difference...
there
used
to
be
a
difference
in
old
three-judge
court
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
antitrust
issue
i
see
stated
in
your
amended
complaint
in
this
case
was
a
preemption
claim,
that
this
statute
was
invalid--
justice
byron
r.
white
--on
its
face
and
as
applied--
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
its
operation
is
preempted
by
the
sherman
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
but
that
is
a
constitutional
issue
the
way
it's
posed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence
the
statute
may
not
operate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
we...
suppose
we
decided
or
suppose
that
you
would
even
agree
that
there
was
no
entanglement
problem
in
adjudicating
this
case
on
an
as-applied
basis
under
the
first
amendment.
now,
should
the
court
be
stuck
with
a
stipulation
between
the
parties
nevertheless
to
decide
it
on
its
face?
let's
just
suppose
that
it's
claimed
that
the
statute
is
invalid
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
now,
should
the
court
first
get
to
the
applied
issue
or
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tribe,
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
meant
to
invalidate
this
statute
wholly
aside
from
the
consent
issue,
if
there
was
just
a
flat
ban
unconnected
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
take
it
your
argument
in
your
brief
and
here
is
primarily
on
the
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree.
but
you're
not
urging
a
holding
that
flat
bans
are
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
argument,
however,
would
invalidate
the
statute
even
if
it
gave...
if
it
was
a
very
general
consent
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
a
church
was
included,
it
would
be
invalid?
