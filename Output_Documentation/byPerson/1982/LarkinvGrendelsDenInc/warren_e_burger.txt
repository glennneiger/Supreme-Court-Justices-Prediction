chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
larkin
v.
grendel's
den.
mr.
caruso,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
the
case
remained
on
the
statutory
basis,
would
we
be
here
now
on
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
the
case
been
resolved
on
the
statutory
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
not
delegate
to
a
religious
institution
a
power
that
is
perhaps
thought
to
be
a
governmental
power?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
giving
the
church,
whatever
church
is
picked
out,
the
power
to
issue
the
license?
how
is
it
distinguishable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
extent,
mr.
tribe,
do
you
think
the
opinion
of
the
first
panel
is
any
factor
in
this
case?
i
got
the
impression
that
you
thought
it
had
some
standing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
soon
as
an
en
banc
was
voted,
that
vacated
the
first
opinion
and
it's
a
complete
nullity,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
first
circuit
doesn't
have
any
other
practice,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
putting
aside
your
stipulations
in
this
case,
are
you
representing
to
the
court
your
view
that
there
was
no
way
to
decide
this
case
without
reaching
constitutional
issues?
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
someone
else
has
suggested
to
you,
the
framing
of
the
issues
in
the
case
doesn't
control
the
court
on
what
issue
should
be
decided.
now,
again,
do
you
say
there
was
no
way
the
court
could
have
avoided
the
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
thesis
would
avoid
the
establishment
clause
problem,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
tribe,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgments
and
opinions
in
two
cases
to
announce
in
larkin
against
grendel's
den,
incorporated.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
