mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
clarifying
what
i
think
are
some
possible
confusions
about
the
facial
and
as
applied
aspects
of
this
case
and
about
the
sherman
act.
it
i
think
was
not
really
odd
that
the
first
circuit
in
its
en
banc
rehearing
did
not
resolve
the
statutory
claim
first,
because
once
the
original
panel
of
the
first
circuit
had
held
that
parker
v.
brown
was
not
a
bar
as
a
matter
of
law
to
what
might
ultimately
become
an
as
applied
trial
of
our
antitrust
claims,
there
was
no
longer
much
dispute
about
that.
we
were
not
pressing
beyond
the
original
complaint.
we
have
not
pressed
a
facial
challenge
to
this
law
under
the
antitrust
acts.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
would
be
problematic
if
they
were
at
the
same
level,
if
they
were
both
facial
claims.
the
reason
it's
permissible
here
is
that
we
think
there
are
very
strong
constitutional
reasons,
principally
under
the
establishment
clause,
not
to
call
father
arkalian
to
the
stand
and
begin
inquiring
into
what
the
motives
were
for
the
denial
of
the
liquor
license
in
this
case.
indeed,
we
think
that,
as
this
court
did
in
the
lovell
case,
lovell
v.
griffin,
and
in
other
cases
where
the
gravamen
of
the
attack
is
to
the
sweeping
and
unaccountable
nature
of
the
power
delegated,
that
it
should,
and
that
it
was
proper
for
the
lower
courts
to,
resolve
the
facial
challenge
first.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
there's
a
constitutional
supremacy
clause
claim
in
any
event.
edgar
v.
mite
last
term
is
a
case
where
this
court
ultimately
decided
on
constitutional,
rather
than
statutory
preemption
grounds
under
the
williams
act.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
so
there's
no
way
of
avoiding
a
constitutional
issue
here,
isn't
that
right?
that
is,
i
take
it
the
point
is
that
even
the
antitrust--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right,
under
the
kessler.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
clear
here
for
the
additional
reason
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
but
justice
stevens,
i
think
as
justice
white
is
suggesting,
the
court
hasn't
treated
the
preemption
ground--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
sherman
act
claim
here
would
not
avoid
the
fundamental
issue,
which
would
still
be
before
the
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
your
honor,
let
me
suggest
why
that's
not
quite
true.
to
win
on
the
sherman
act
claim,
i
think
we
would
have
to
concede
that
the
first
circuit's
original
panel
decision
that
a
facial
sherman
act
attack
is
implausible
here.
we'd
have
to
concede
that
there's
a
great
deal
in
that.
to
win
on
the
sherman
act
claim,
we
would
have
to
show
that
the
church
in
this
case
was
wielding
its
veto
power
as
part
of
an
anticompetitive
scheme
to
benefit
certain
contributors.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
whatever
this
court
might
hold
in
brown
v.
socialist
workers
party,
argued
this
morning,
there's
very
good
reason
to
believe
that
under
its
entanglement
decisions
an
inquisition
into
the
contributors
of
this
church
and
the
reason
the
veto
was
wielded
in
this
case
and
not
in
others
as
to
the
other
14
licenses
that
have
been
granted
in
the
last
decade
would
pose
such
serious
constitutional
problems--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
is
an
allegation
in
this
case.
that's
what
the
sherman
act
claim
is
all
about,
and
i
hope
the
court
is
not
detained
by
it.
the
sherman
act
claim
suggests
that,
as
justice
brandeis
believed
when
he
testified
on
this
matter
back
in
1891,
that
the
temptation
to
venal
exercise
of
this
kind
of
power--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
alleges--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--because
in
order
to
prove
that,
your
honor,
we
would
anticipate
the
other
side
would
argue
that
the
kind
of
evidence
we
would
need
is
constitutionally--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
have
reason
to
believe
it.
but
in
order
to
probe
it,
in
order
to
probe
it
in
the
way
that
would
be
necessary
to
ultimately
succeed,
we
would
have
to
overcome
another
constitutional
obstacle,
the
obstacle
that
they
suggest
in
their
briefs
when
they
argue
that
administrative
assessment
of
the
church's
concerns...
this
is
at
page
85
of
the
attorney
general's
brief...
that
administrative
assessment
of
the
church's
concerns
and
of
the
reasons
for
the
exercise
of
its
veto
would
itself
create
such
grave
entanglement
problems
as
to
pose
a
constitutional
obstacle.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
but
as
this
court
has
held
in
cases
such
as
serbian
orthodox
and
others,
either
judicial
or
administrative
assessment
of
the
internal
motives
and
workings
of
a
religious
body's
decisionmaking
process
raises
grave
first
amendment
problems.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
act
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--to
file
the
original
complaint.
but
we
are
asking
this
court,
as
we
asked
successfully
the
first
circuit,
to
rule
that
this
law
is
void
on
its
face,
that
its
void
on
its
face
because--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--on
information
and
belief,
yes,
of
course,
your
honor,
and
it
was
asserted
on
that
basis.
the
belief
is
based
on
information
that
we
think
could
be
developed,
but
to
which
there
may
be
constitutional--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--on
the
basis
of
what
was
known
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
but
i
really
think
this
is
a
distraction.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
argument
exactly
could
have
been
made
in
eubank,
where
this
court
facially
invalidated
an
ordinance
giving
power
to
private
parties
to
tell
others
what
to
do
with
their
property,
and
instead,
and
instead
the
court
said
that
the
illustrations
of
abuse
are
simply
relevant
to
showing
how
facially
void
the
law
is.
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
in
lovell.
the
same
argument
could
be
made
in
the
cases
involving--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
in
each
of
those
cases
there
was
a
claim,
but
nonetheless
a
narrower
ground
was
available,
namely
an
as
applied
invalidation.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no,
i
was
only
suggesting
as
a
matter
of
understanding
the
evolution
of
the
antitrust
issue
that
one
look
at
it.
it's
the
other
side--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
that's
correct,
that
is
the
only
opinion
before
this
court,
is
an
opinion
holding
that
this
law
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
i
think
in
understanding
that
opinion
it's
necessary
to
recognize
that
the
entanglement
difficulties
of
assessing
its
validity
as
applied
in
a
particular
case
both
may
have
explained
the
court's
reaching
for
a
facial
ground
and
avoiding
the
antitrust
issue,
which
would
require
a
trial
with
entanglement.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
as
applied.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
correct.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
that
is
what
we
believe.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
therefore
this
court's
practice
of
avoiding
constitutional
issues
would
not
suggest--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
would
say
that
the
inquiry
into
why
the
church
exercised
its
veto
power
is
a--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't
say
it's
impossible,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i'm
only
suggesting
that
we
would--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
ask
for
a
declaration
of
two
kinds,
mr.
justice
white.
we
ask
for
a
declaration
that
the
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments;
and
a
declaration
that
when
applied...
this
is
in
paragraph
2...
as
applied
to
approve
and
effectuate
these
agreements,
it
would
violate
the
sherman
act.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
may
not
so
operate.
hence
the
use
of
the
veto
power
in
this
way
must
be
enjoined
or
at
least
declared
invalid.
now,
i
don't
deny,
justice
stevens,
that
it
is
possible...
and
indeed,
we
originally
drafted--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--we
allege
such
agreements.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
if
we--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
it's...
the
private
agreements
are...
let
me
explain,
justice
stevens.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
correct.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
those
private
agreements
would
have
no
effect
on
grendel's
den
in
this
case
had
they
not
led
the
church
to
exercise
its
veto
power.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
the
only
relief
we
sought
was
not
damages
against
the
private
parties.
the
only
relief
we
sought
was
a
declaration
that
the
church's
exercise
of
this
veto,
because
of
the
underlying
private
agreements,
could
not
be
given
effect
by
the
state
officials.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
state
officials
said,
well,
that's
clearly
an
attempt
to
apply
the
sherman
act
to
state
action,
and
it's
at
that
point
that
the
private
action
becomes
relevant.
the
state
has
not
mandated
these
agreements.
we
therefore
believe
that
at
an
as-applied
trial
it
could
be
shown,
within
the
confines
of
this
court's
delimitation
of
the
parker
v.
brown
doctrine,
that
the
reason
the
veto
was
exercised
was
anticompetitive
agreements
and
therefore
the
state
officials
should
not
have
given
effect
to
the
exercise.
but
it
would
not
be
enough
to
prevail
at
that
trial
to
show
that
there
were
some
people
who
had
unlawful
agreements,
because
that
didn't
hurt
grendel's
den.
to
prevail
we
would
have
to
inquire
into
the
reason
the
veto
was
exercised.
that
inquiry
would
violate
the
establishment
clause
or
at
least
would
raise
serious
problems.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
suppose
if
we
had
to
rest
with
their
answer,
without
pursuing
the
matter
further
through
depositions
and
interrogatories,
there'd
be
no
problem.
but
ordinarily
at
such
a
trial
one
is
able
to
pursue
the
matter
further.
and
the
very
position
the
state
has
taken
in
this
case
is
that
the
reason
this
absolute
veto
is
so
terrific
is
that
it
prevents
one
from
piercing
the
shield
of
the
church
and
going
into
the
reasons.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there
are
two...
i'm
afraid
that
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
is
to
say
that
there
are
two
levels
of
as-applied
analysis
here.
one
is
to
say
that
when
the
statute
is
applied
to
create
a
crazy-quilt
like
this,
in
which
14
licensees,
some
right
around
the
corner,
some
across
the
street,
get
a
liquor
license
and
others
don't,
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
there's
another
kind
of
as-applied
claim,
which
is
to
suggest
that
in
this
case
the
veto
was
applied
either
to
exact
contributions
for
the
church
or
to
advance
the
church's
religious
beliefs.
now,
what
we
suggest
is
that
either
of
those
grounds
is
highly
problematic,
the
second
because
of
the
entanglement
involved
in
the
inquiry
into
the
motives
of
the
church
and
the
first
because
the
invalidity
of
this
blank
check
of
absolute
veto
power
that
is
handed
to
the
church
does
not
depend
upon
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
if
the
state
wants,
as
the
state
of
massachusetts
purports
to
want,
to
allow
the
views
of
churches
to
be
weighed
and
considered
in
making
judgments
that
accommodate
religious
needs,
it
has
ample
means
for
doing
that.
indeed,
the
licensing
authorities
of
massachusetts
are
ready
to
listen
to
the
claims
of
all
neighboring
abutters,
all
churches,
all
others,
as
to
why
they
might
not
want
liquor
in
the
neighborhood
or
why
they
might
want
it
in
some
instances
and
not
in
others.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
can
decide
that
the
judgment...
well,
let
me
see.
i
suppose
there's
no
way
to
have
resolved
ultimately
the
claim
that
grendel's
wanted
to
advance,
the
claim
that
this
veto
should
not
be
enforced,
without
reaching
some
constitutional
issue.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
there
is
no
way
the
court
could
have
avoided
it,
however
we
framed
the
question,
given
the
relief
we
sought,
and
surely
the
parties
have
the
right
to
seek
particular
relief.
the
relief
we
sought
was
the
removal
of
the
burden
of
this
veto.
now,
in
order
to
gain
that
relief
we
would
have
to
have
shown
either
that
the
delegation
of
veto
power
was
unconstitutional,
which
we
believe
we
have
shown
both
under
the
due
process
clause
and
under
the
establishment
clause,
or
that
the
way
in
which
the
veto
was
wielded
in
this
particular
case
and
the
reasons
for
which
it
was
wielded...
not
just
the
private
agreements
that
might
have
lain
behind
it,
the
reasons
the
veto
was
exercised...
violated
our
rights,
either
because
of
the
sherman
act
or
because
of
our
rights
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
way
the
case
could
have
been
framed
to
resolve
that
issue
without
reaching
a
constitutional
question
of
entanglement
and
without
reaching,
even
under
the
sherman
act,
the
question
of
preemption.
for
that
reason,
we
don't
think
that
a
constitutional
issue
has
somehow
been
foisted
upon
the
federal
judiciary
in
this
case.
we
think
it's
unavoidable
in
the
factual
posture
of
a
veto
having
been
exercised
by
a
church.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
because
our
primary
sense
was
not...
the
complaint
here
really
was
that
grendel's
den
was
subject
to
the
absolute
discretion
of
one
neighbor,
the
church,
and
that
that
was
fundamentally
unfair,
that
it
was
threatening
to
put
them
out
of
business,
and
that
it
was
subjecting
them
to
the
kind
of
power
that
the
framers
never
imagined
that
churches
or
other
private
parties
would
exercise.
now,
as
it
happened,
we
also
thought
if
we
could
not
establish
that
that
fundamental
proposition
was
correct
and
that
it
was
facially
void,
that
at
that
point
we
ought
to
have
a
right
in
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
despite
the
constitutional
entanglement
problems,
to
see
relief
from
this
particular
veto.
suing
the
particular
individuals
in
this
case,
rather
than
seeking
invalidation
of
the
delegation
of
power,
would
not
have
given
the
relief
sought,
which
was
this
liquor
license,
and
in
any
event
would
have
raised
very
difficult
problems
of
trial,
given
the
entanglement
problems,
of
finding
out
why
the
church
in
fact
exercised
its
veto.
and
therefore
the
harm
that
we
sought
relief
from,
the
denial
of
the
license,
was
harm
that
could
be
removed
only
by
seeking
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
against
these
state
officials.
the
power
that
was
exercised
here,
and
i
think
this
is
important
in
light
of
justice
rehnquist's
question
about
new
motor
v.
fox,
was
not
just
the
power
to
trigger
a
public
inquiry.
in
new
motor
v.
fox,
as
the
majority
pointed
out
in
justice
brennan's
opinion,
the
only
effect
of
the
refusal
of
the
old
franchisee
to
tolerate
the
incursion
by
a
new
franchisee
was
to
open
up
a
public
hearing.
in
this
case
the
effect
is
far
greater
than
that.
the
effect
is
absolutely
and
totally,
as
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
and
as
the
state
commissioners
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
commission
said,
absolutely
to
veto
the
license
permanently.
and
during
the
ten
years
in
which
that
veto
has
been
exercised,
others
have
been
licensed.
now,
we
don't
think
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
grendel's
den
to
engage
in
a
problematic
inquiry
into
the
internal
motives
of
the
church,
though
if
we
had
to
at
trial
we
would
certainly
try,
in
order
to
obtain
relief
under
the
rather
simple
proposition,
which
i
think
the
framers
would
have
found
self-evident,
that
the
owners
of
property
cannot
be
told
what
to
do
with
their
property
in
the
unfettered,
unreviewable,
unaccountable
discretion
of
a
single
private
body,
namely
a
church.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
happily,
justice
marshall,
there
are
laws
against
bribery.
there
are
no
laws
against
making
contributions
to
a
church
in
order
to
show
that
one
is
good-spirited
and
that
one
is
not
going
to
be
a
problematic
neighbor.
and
the
line
between
a
payoff
and
a
contribution--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
brandeis
feared
that
exactly
this
would
happen.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
1891.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
the
problem
is
an
enduring
one.
it
was
his
point
that,
although
he
was
an
ardent
prohibitionist
and
believed
in
local
zoning
power,
it
was
his
belief
that
the
temptation
to
shade
things
a
little
and
make
decisions
on
impermissible
bases
would
be
irresistible,
but
difficult
to
prove
in
particular
cases.
and
he
was
talking
about
a
veto
power
wielded
by
all
neighbors,
not
a
veto
power
wielded
by
one
neighbor
that
happens
to
be
a
church
dedicated
to
divine
worship.
so
that
the
abuse
that
led
him,
despite
his
belief
about
temperance
and
despite
his
belief
about
the
importance
of
local
zoning,
the
abuse
that
would
inhere
in
this
kind
of
governmental
power
being
delegated
to
private
parties
was
something
that
ought
to
be
prevented
by
not
giving
this
kind
of
veto
power.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
marshall,
that
is
the
necessity
to
which
we
would
be
placed
if
justice
rehnquist's
suggestion
that
there
ought
to
be
an
antitrust
trial--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
is
not,
justice
marshall,
by
any
means
indispensable
to
our
prevailing.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
giving
a
property
owner
that
happens
to
be
a
church
a
power
of
life
and
death
over
nearby
establishments
violates
the
constitution.
it
is
the
sort
of
power
that
in
england
they
had
for
hundreds
of
years,
finally
got
rid
of
in
the
beer
act
of
1830;
the
kind
of
power
that
the
american
colonies
refused
to
give
their
established
churches.
it
is
the
kind
of
power
that
massachusetts
didn't
delegate
when
it
had
a
flat
ban
on
liquor
in
1954.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
happily,
this
case
doesn't
pose
the
issue.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
if
it
were
a
very
narrowly
focused
flat
ban,
it
might
pose
problems.
but
i
do
not
think
the
first
circuit
suggested
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional...
that
is,
if
the
state
were
to
say
that
we
don't
believe
that
liquor
and
religion
mix...
then
the
case
would
be
much
more
like
the
decisions
in
larue
and
bellanca
saying
that
liquor
and
sex
don't
mix,
where
this
court
has
said
that
that's
a
permissible
determination.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
could
nonetheless
be
made
that
when
a
branch
of
alcoholics
anonymous
has
no
veto
power,
that
is
when
a
branch
of
alcoholics
anonymous
is
not
surrounded
by
a
liquor-free
zone,
when
libraries
and
hospitals
are
not
surrounded
by
liquor-free
zones,
to
surround
certain
churches
with
those
zones
might
still
be
preferential
treatment.
but
that
issue
is
not
presented
here.
the
reason
we
have
such
a
crazy-quilt
in
an
area
that,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
is
hardly
tranquil
and
hardly
sober,
namely
the
business
core
of
harvard
square,
the
reason
we
have
such
a
crazy-quilt
is
that
this
is
not
a
flat
ban,
and
because
it's
not
a
flat
ban--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
some
of
the
quilts
might
not
be
as
crazy.
but
the
power
itself--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--or
crazy
at
all.
but
the
way
to
assure
that
those
crazy-quilts
be
avoided
is
not
to
delegate
unreviewable,
unaccountable
power
to
a
single
body
whose
unaccountability
is
even
greater
than
that
of
other
private
owners,
because
in
the
case
of
other
private
owners
there
isn't
even
an
arguable
barrier
under
the
establishment
clause
to
probing
and
not
just
accepting
the
initial
answer
about
what
the
motives
were,
probing
the
real
motives.
here
there
is
a
double
bind--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think,
justice
white,
the
opinion
is
ambiguous.
i
think
they
meant
to
say
there
are
two
infirmities
and
that
they
don't
decide
whether
either
standing
alone
would
suffice.
they
say
it's
a
benefit
to
a
narrow
class.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
and
we
don't
think
it
matters
whether
you
call
it
consent
or
waiver.
we
think
frankly--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
because
we
think
that,
just
as
justice
rehnquist
would
want
to
avoid
the
whole
constitutional
issue,
certainly
that
more
difficult
constitutional
issue
should
be
avoided
here.
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
court
has
never
upheld
and
should
never
uphold
a
provision
whereby
a
single
private
owner,
especially
a
church,
has
an
unaccountable
power
over
the
livelihood
and
property
of
others.
we
also
believe
that
this
court
should
not
subject--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
right.
justice
stevens,
we
make
this
entirely
separate
delegation
argument,
which
we
think
is
strong
enough
to
prevail
whether
it's
a
church
or
not.
we
think
it
is
strengthened
for
two
reasons
because
it's
a
church:
first,
that
violates
the
establishment
clause
principle
of
not
giving
special
privileges
to
churches;--
but
second,
insofar
as
one
might
otherwise
cure
a
delegation
by
implying
some
power
of
review
or
revision
of
the
sort
that
the
state
supreme
court
here
refused
to
find
in
the
earlier
case
that
came
before
it,
that
ability
to
review
the
motives
of
the
delegatee
is
drastically
reduced
when
the
power
is
delegated
to
a
church.
so
in
that
sense
and
in
that
sense
only,
the
claim
is
made
much
stronger
by
virtue
of
the
religious
character
of
the
person
to
whom
power
is
delegated.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
under
the
establishment
clause,
i
think
that's
right,
justice
white.
but
that's
why
it
becomes
i
think
important,
since
someone
might
argue
that
it
violates
the
free
exercise
clause
to
excise
churches
from
that
kind
of
power.
that's
why
we
take
some
solace
from
the
fact
that
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
delegation
of
power
generally
does
not
depend
on
the
fact
that
it's
a
church.
i
want
to
stress
that
this
court
has
never
upheld
unilateral
power
in
a
single
property
owner
to
determine,
without
public
review
or
accountability,
how
others
may
use
their
property.
certainly
new
motor
v.
fox
was
not
such
a
case.
in
new
motor
v.
fox,
one
way
or
the
other
during
the
time
of
the
dispute
between
the
old
and
the
new
franchisee
someone
would
have
to
out
of
luck.
this
is
a
permanent
deprivation
as
long
as
the
church
maintains
its
veto.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
would
certainly
avoid
the
establishment
clause
problem,
and
it
would
be
a
welcome
opportunity
for
this
court
to
remind
people
that
those
decisions,
although
they
may
look
old...
eubank
v.
richmond,
1912;
washington
ex
rel.
seattle
v.
roberge,
1928...
represent
good
law.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
this
court
cited
them
with
approval
in
1976
in
eastlake.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
was
once.
the
reason
i
think
they've
rarely
been
cited
is
that
most
people
have
followed
them
and
obeyed
them.
that
is,
the
effrontery
of
a
state
in
deciding
that
the
livelihood
of
a
restaurant
in
harvard
square
is
going
to
depend
on
one
property
owner's
whim
is
something
that
this
court
has
happily
been
spared
in
most
cases.
this
case
is
worse
in
a
very
special
way.
in
all
of
those
cases
where
the
court
has
gone
in
various
ways
depending
on
factual
nuances,
at
least
it
could
be
said
that
a
neighborhood
of
owners
got
to
vote
somehow
on
whether
a
particular
use
would
be
allowed
or
not.
never
in
this
court
have
we
been
confronted
with
a
situation
where
one
owner
has
a
decisive
veto
power
over
an
otherwise
lawful
activity.
and
why
someone
who
is
subjected
to
that
veto
should
have
to
go
through
a
trial
and
psychoanalyze
the
reasons
the
veto
was
exercised,
something
that
as
a
last
resort
we
would
be
willing
to
do,
before
the
obvious
constitutional
question
is
disposed
of,
is
really
beyond
me.
i
don't
think
anything
would
be
gained
by
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
more
difficult
cases
in
the
area.
i
think
it
was
wrongly
decided,
justice
o'connor.
but
i
think
it's
distinguishable
in
several
ways.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
interpreted
the
purposes
of
the
waiver
as...
of
the
current
veto,
which
they
describe
specifically
in
their
opinion
as
a
veto.
they
said
this
is
the
delegation
of
a
veto
power
at
page
175a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix.
they
said
its
purpose
is
really
no
different
from
that
of
a
waiver.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
cases...
and
it's
not
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
to
interpret
them...
establish
that
it's
not
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
choice
between
waiver
and
veto
that
counts.
what
counts
is
that
other
private
parties
have
been
given
the
power
to
dispose
of
the
fate
of
other
private
parties.
but
even
if
cusack
were
controlling
and
one
said
this
is
a
waiver,
there'd
be
a
fundamental
difference.
in
cusack,
the
owners
of
over
half
the
property
in
the
area
had
to
vote
on
the
matter.
it
was
a
little
like
the
referendum
case
in
which
the
chief
justice
upheld
spot
zoning
by
the
city
of
eastlake.
this
court
could
well
hold
that
the
question
of
when
property
owners
as
a
collectivity
can
be
given
a
kind
of
local
option
over
the
entry
of
nonconforming
uses,
such
as
a
billboard
in
a
residential
area,
is
a
difficult
and
different
question
from
the
question
when
one
property
owner,
not
involved
in
cusack
or
roberge
or
eubank,
can
unilaterally
dispose
of
how
others
may
use
their
property.
that
question
it
seems
to
me
can
lead
to
only
one
answer
if
the
due
process
clause
is
to
mean
rule
of
law
rather
than
subjection
to
someone
else's
whim
and
will.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
would
no
longer
be
a
veto.
if
there
were
a
neighborhood
referendum--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
it
would
be
at
least
a
different
case.
i
wouldn't
recommend
that
the
law
be
so
amended--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--because
i
think
it
would
pose
other
constitutional
problems.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you
very
much.
