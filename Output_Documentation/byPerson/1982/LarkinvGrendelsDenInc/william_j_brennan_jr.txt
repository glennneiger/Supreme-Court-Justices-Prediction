justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
caruso,
i'm
just
curious.
the
initial
panel
decision
was
three
court
of
appeals
judges,
wasn't
it?
and
the
en
banc
was
also
three?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how'd
that
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see,
sitting
by
designation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
true
of
all
26
other
licensed
establishments
in
this
zone?
were
they
all
establishments
which
made
an
application
which
the
church
could
have
objected
to
but
did
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
1954?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1968?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
which
the
church
might
have,
but
did
not,
object?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
caruso,
don't
many
state
statutes
like
this
take
the
form
of
a
flat
ban?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
you
just
suggest
to
my
brother
white
that
they'd
be
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
they
been
tested
in
any
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
including
all
the
flat
bans?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
whether
the
attacks
on
the
flat
ban
statutes
have
been
on
establishment
clause
grounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
caruso,
you
don't
make
any
argument
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
supports
you
on
the
establishment
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
argue
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
makes
this
constitutional
irrespective
of
the
establishment
clause?
