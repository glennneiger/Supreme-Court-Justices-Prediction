mr.
attorney
general,
may
a
church
exercise
what
you
characterize
as
a
waiver
on
a
selective
basis,
so
that
it
would
allow
a
liquor
store
in
one
building
and
deny
it
in
an
adjacent
building?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
permissible
under
the
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that
could
be
done
arbitrarily,
with
no
reason,
no
standard
prescribed
by
the
legislature.
suppose
one
of
the
liquor
stores
was
operated
by
a
friend
of
the
bishop
and
the
other
not?
