justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
statute
said
that
all
liquor
licenses
in
massachusetts
shall
be
controlled
by
a
board
consisting
of
the
leader
of
the
catholic
church,
the
protestant
churches.
you
wouldn't
buy
that,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
may
i
ask
you
the
difference
between
that
one
and
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
did
the
first
one,
i
assumed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
hypothetical
is
the
state
legislature
passed
it--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
assuming
i
understand
why
a
church
would
not
want
a
bar
and
grill
in
its
neighborhood,
how
do
i
understand
that
a
church
wants
a
bar
and
grill
next
door?
i
mean,
what
does
that
promote,
a
situation
where
a
church
wants
a
bar
and
grill
next
door
to
the
church?
now,
what
interest
does
that
promote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
if
the
church
only
has
bars
that
sell
irish
whisky?
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
allows
bars
in
its
neighborhood
that
sell
irish
whisky.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
going
from
there
to
tequila.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i
mean,
i
can
go
anywhere
i
want
to
go.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
should
i,
as
a
legitimate
businessman,
have
to
go
and
ask
a
church
whether
i
can
do
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that's
not
today.
this
is
today.
i
just
got
the
money
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
don't
leave
out
any
of
my
points.
i
just
got
the
money
today
and
i
want
to
open
up
a
bar
and
a
grill,
and
i've
got
to
ask
the
church's
permission.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
no.
it
said
it's
not
a
suitable
site
unless
you
get
the
permission
of
the
church.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
the
state
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
exactly
what
i
said.
i
cannot
open
up
my
business
in
that
area
that's
near
the
church
without
the
permission
of
the
church
to
tell
me
whether
or
not
i
can
spend
my
money
in
my
property.
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
i
get
it
without
the
permission
of
the
church?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
don't
i
have
to
get
the
permission
of
the
church?
justice
thurgood
marshall
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wouldn't
be
new
orleans?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
they
don't
have
any
closing
law
down
there.
they
serve
liquor
24
hours
a
day,
every
day
including
sunday.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
need
more
than
belief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
all
you
have
is
belief.
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
do
you
have
a
right
to
assert
something
on
belief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
information
which
you
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
tribe,
i'm
still
worried
about
the
original
proposition
of
alleging
that
some
dealers
will
pay
off
somebody
and
get
permission.
couldn't
you
just
as
easily
say
that
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
board
itself
might
take
a
little
money
and
throw
the
act
on
that
basis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
that
you've
never
heard
of
anything
like
it
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
18-what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
1982.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree,
but
i
don't
see
the
necessity
for
saying
the
reason
is
because
they'll
take
money
illegally.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
count
me
out
of
that.
