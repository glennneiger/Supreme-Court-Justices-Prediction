arguments
first
this

nigeria.
mr.
chayes,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
absent
that
act
what
would
be
the
situation
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
be
anything.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say,
mr.
chayes,
that
this
dichotomy
that
was
developed
in
1952
is
somewhat
analogous
to
the
old
concept
of
proprietary
and
governmental
functions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
bator?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
state
court
it
could
be
moved
rather
readily,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
could
it?
could
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
case
arise
under
the
'76
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
congress
say
about
state
court
jurisdiction
in
the
'76
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
explanation
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
why
the
state
court
jurisdiction
provision
was
given
and...
with
one
hand
and
taken
away
with
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
shulman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--must
the
complaint
affirmatively
recite
that
the
transaction
on
which
the
claim
is
based
was
a
transaction
involving
the
proprietary
commercial
interests
of
the
sovereign?
must
that
be
affirmatively
stated
in
the
complaint
as
a
basis
for
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
let
it
go
to
the
proof,
the
evidence,
to
determine
that
it
was
a
proprietary
commercial
function.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
on
these
facts
the
case
had
been
brought
prior
to
1976
and
before
the
act?
what
would
you--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--even
if
the
executive
branch
raised
no
objection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
now,
in
1976,
congress
has
said
a
suit
may
be
brought
in
states
and
granting
removal
jurisdiction
to
a
federal
court,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
does
that
act...
does
not
that
action
arise
under
that
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
chayes,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
