mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
suit
on
a
letter
of
credit.
the
only
federal
question
or
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent,
a
foreign
sovereign,
is
immune.
that
issue
can
be
decided
by
a
state
court.
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
applies
to
courts
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
states.
a
state
court
can
apply
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
in
determining
immunity
just
as
it
applies
the
u.s.
constitution
in
determining
the
due
process
limitations
on
personal
jurisdiction.
the
case
of
texas
trading
v....
texas
trading
and
milling
corporation
v.
federal
republic
of
nigeria,
to
which
mr.
chayes
referred,
illustrates
this
point.
in
that
case,
the
court
found
that
nigeria's
activity
in
purchasing
cement
amounted
to
a
commercial
activity
outside
of
the
united
states
under
the
fsia.
it
found
that
harm
to
united
states
companies
that
were
not
paid
on
their
letters
of
credit
constituted
a
direct
effect
in
the
united
states
under
the
fsia.
the
court
then
turned
to
an
analysis
of
the
contacts
with
the
forum
necessary
to
sustain
personal
jurisdiction.
the
court
there
found
that
nigeria's
extensive
use
of
the
morgan
guaranty
trust
company,
through
which
it
had
advised
the
letters
of
credit,
constituted
a
purposeful
availing
itself
of
the
privilege
of
conducting
activities
in
the
united
states
under
the
rule
of
hanson
v.
denckla
and
international
shoe.
now,
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
cited
hanson
v.
denckla
and
international
shoe
and
interpreted
those
decisions
did
not
make
this
case
one
that
arises
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
by
the
same
token,
the
fact
that
the
court
applied
the
fsia
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
commercial
activity
and
a
direct
effect
does
not
make
this
case
one
that
arises
under
the
laws
or
a
law
of
the
united
states.
the
case
clearly
does
not
meet
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule
set
forth
in
the
landmark
case
of
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
v.
mottley.
this
court
should
construe
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
to
provide
jurisdiction
only
when
the
plaintiff
is
a
citizen.
this
is
the
same
thing
that
this
court
did
in
1800
when
it
was
considering
the
judiciary
act
providing
jurisdiction
when
an
alien
was
a
party.
the
court
there
in
mossman
v.
higginson
held
that
the
other
party
had
to
be
a
citizen,
and
the
rule
of
strict
construction
set
forth
in
romero
versus
international
terminal
operating
company
would
support
this
court
in
interpreting
the
statute
to
require
that
the
plaintiff
be
a
citizen
where
there
is
not
a
federal
question,
where
there
is
not
a
case
arising
under.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
i
am
arguing
in
support
of
the
judgment
below,
and
this
is
an
additional
ground
which
i
believe
is
available
to
support
the
judgment.
the
court
below
did
agree
with
the
analysis
that
mr.
chayes
and
mr.
bator
had
put
on
the
case,
which
is
that
the
congress
intended
the
statute
to
apply
when
an
alien
was
a
plaintiff.
however,
that
analysis
is
not
supported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
case.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
do
was
to
adopt
a
restricted
standard
of
immunity
and
to
have
those
standards
determined
judicially
rather
than
politically
by
the
executive
department.
it
does
not
show
a
purpose
to
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
beyond
the
diversity
and
federal
question
jurisdiction
scope
that
they
previously
had.
the
congress
did
contemplate
that
there
would
be
fsia
cases
in
federal
courts,
of
course,
and
normally
there
will
be
litigation
in
the
federal
courts,
because
normally
the
plaintiff
will
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
texas
trading
case
again
illustrates
that
point.
there
were
four
companies
there,
all
of
whom
were
citizens
of
the
united
states.
when
the
plaintiff
is
not
a
citizen,
and
when
the
claim
at
issue
is
not
federal,
article
iii
forecloses
federal
jurisdiction.
all
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
does
in
those
circumstances
is
to
provide
authority
to
pursue
the
claim.
it
is
much
like
the
statute
which
allowed
a
suit
at
law
but
not
a
summary
attachment
to
collect
the
puerto
rican
tax
in
puerto
rico
v.
russell
and
company.
it
is
like
the
act
of
congress
limiting
the
immunity
of
national
banks
from
state
taxation
in
gully
v.
first
national
bank.
the
provision
of
authority
to
pursue
the
claim
does
not
constitute
the
creation
of
the
case
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
reason
why
you
must
plead
it
is
because
the
federal
rules
require
you
to
make
a
statement
of
the
jurisdictional
basis
of
the
claim,
and
that
same
rule,
which
i
believe
is
federal
rule
8,
goes
on
to
say
that
the
claim
itself
is
set
forth
separately.
in
fact,
the
rule
shows
that
the
jurisdictional
statement
is
not
part
of
the
claim.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
your
honor,
the
statute
provides
for
jurisdiction
when
the
foreign
state
is
not
immune.
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
you
allege
it
as
part
of
your
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
justice
marshall,
let
me
draw
your
attention
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
filed
by
guinea
as
an
amicus
curiae,
and
i
quote
from
the
house
report
as
follows:
"an
implicit
waiver
would
also
include
a
situation
where
a
foreign
state
has
filed
a
responsive
pleading
in
an
action
without
raising
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity.
"
we
believe
that
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity
is
an
affirmative
defense.
we
would
answer
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
mr.
chayes
contrary
the
way
he
answered
it.
it
is
true
that
the
jurisdictional
allegations
in
the
complaint
will
refer
to
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
it
also
happens,
by
the
way,
that
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case
urges
that
the
court
solve
the
constitutional
difficulty
by
treating
it
as
if
it
was
not--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
have
the
specific
complaint
of
the
verlinden
company
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
but
the--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--it
is
not...
it
is
not
an
issue
in
the
sense
of
arising
under.
it
is
an
issue
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
decision
that
needs
be
made
in
a
case
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
no
one
challenges
that
before
a
state
can
be
held
liable,
the
state
must
be
held
to
be
not
immune.
the
standards
on
which
that
statement,
that
decision
would
be
made
are
federal
standards.
that
does
not
mean
that
that
constitutes
a
case
arising
under
the
law
of
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
original
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
logical
extension
of
that
point
in
terms
of
the
point
that
justice
marshall
was
making
would
mean
that
a
diversity
case
was
a
case
arising
under
a
federal
law,
because
you
had
to
plead
in
your
case
as
an
element
of
your
case
the
diverse
citizenship
of--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--that
doesn't
vary
appreciably
from
the
fact
that
you
have
to
determine
what
the
citizenship
of
a
corporation
is,
and
the
standard,
which
is
that
the
corporation
would
be
a
citizen
of
the
states
in
which
it
does
business
and
the
state
in
which
it
is
incorporated,
is
a
substantive
law,
if
you
will,
in
that
same
sense.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
the
federal
arbitration
act,
of
course,
does
not
provide
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
mr.
justice,
my
impression
of
the
arbitration
act
is
that
it
is
not
jurisdictional.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
no.
what
the
complaint
must
allege
is
that
there
is
jurisdiction
under
section
1330.
1330
says
that
the--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--because,
among
other
things,
that
is
not
the
only
basis
for
determining
non-immunity.
there
is
also
non-immunity
when
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
immunity.
and
as
i
read
to
the
court
from
the
legislative
history,
one
instance
in
which
a
waiver
takes
place
is
by
the
foreign
sovereign
failing
in
its
responsive
pleading
to
assert
the
defense.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
yes,
there
certainly
would.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
no,
it
does
not
follow,
because
article
iii
requires
two
things.
one
is
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
the
other
is
a
case
or
controversy.
you
must
have
a
case
or
a
controversy
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
if
this
case
had
been
decided
in
a
state
court,
and
the
foreign
state
were
held
to
be
not
immune,
and
the
state
court
went
on
to
hold
that
the
letter
of
credit
was
not
breached,
this
court
would
not
review
the
immunity--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--in
the
case
where
the
judgment
was
entered
against
the
foreign
sovereign--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--then
this
court
would
review,
and
in
that
case
you
would
have
a
case
or
controversy.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
because
in
the
context
of
original
jurisdiction--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--the
whole
basis
of
the
independent
state
ground
rule,
your
honor,
is,
i
believe,
that
whenever
the
court
has
appellate
jurisdiction,
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
a
federal
court
had
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
i
believe
that
is
because
you
are
excluding
from
that
confining
the
words
"case
or
controversy".
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
because
you
do
not
have
a
case
or
controversy
under...
involving
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
until
that
issue
is
raised
and
litigated.
you
could
have
a
case
brought
by
a
plaintiff
against
a
foreign
sovereign,
let
us
say
in
a
state
court,
removed
by
the
foreign
sovereign,
who
does
not
go
on
to
assert
immunity,
and
the
case
would
go
through
the
federal
court
without
a
federal
issue
ever
having
come
up.
in
that
case,
it
would
have
been
an
improper
exercise
of
federal
jurisdiction.
conversely,
you
could
have
a
state--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
no.
it
does
follow
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii
that
that
case
or
controversy
arises
under
federal
law
for
purposes
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
because
at
that
point
in
the
schedule,
you
have
a
case
or
controversy.
you
do
not
have
a
case
or
controversy
for
purposes
of
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
prior
to
1976,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
there
would
have
been
no
way
to
get
into
the
federal
court.
there
is
no
federal
coloration
to
the
case.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
the
case
could
have
been
brought
in
a
state
court.
then
you
would
have
had
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
executive
branch
would
choose
to
make
a
suggestion
of
immunity
or
not.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
what
the
point
is.
there
is
no
great
unusual
aspect
to
a
state
court
making
a
decision
on
a
federal
question.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
correct,
and
i
believe--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
of
when
a
claim
arises,
a
claim
arises
under
a
statute
involves
whether
or
not
the
source
of
the
right
that
you
are
asserting
is
a
federal
law
or
not.
this
is
the...
the
fact
that
there
is
lurking
in
the
background
of
the
case
somewhere
a
federal
issue
does
not
make
the
case
one
arising
under
a
federal
law.
it
makes
it
a
case
in
which
a
federal
question
is
presented
which
may
eventually
be
reviewable
by
this
court
on
appellate
jurisdiction,
because
there
is
then
a
case
or
controversy.
but
it
does
not
mean
that
it
becomes
a
matter
of
original
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
protective
jurisdiction
concept
which
has
floated
about
the
briefs
a
bit,
and
specifically
the
petitioner's
brief
raises
four
areas
in
which
it
suggests
that
there
is
a
protective
jurisdiction
of
some
sort
here.
those
four
areas
are
the
osborn
v.
bank
of
united
states
area
which
mr.
bator
also
sought
to
assert
as
a
basis,
the
removal
of
state
proceedings
against
federal
officers
for
actions
under
color
of
their
office,
the
authority
of
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
sue
in
federal
court
on
a
state
law
claim,
and
then
the
national
mutual
insurance
company
v.
tidewater
transfer
case
and
the
textile
workers
union
v.
lincoln
mills
case.
now,
in
the
first
three
of
those
suggested
bases
of
protective
jurisdiction,
you
see
the
difference
between
a
true
federal
interest
in
the
ultimate
disposition
of
the
case
and
a
collateral
federal
interest
in
one
question
in
the
issue.
in
osborn,
the
basic
powers
of
the
bank,
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
the
bank,
the
whole
aspect
of
the
bank
was
a
matter
of
federal
interest.
in
the
removal
cases,
the
federal
interest
was
the
assurance
that
federal
officers
would
not
be
impeded
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
by
states.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
necessity
for
a
federal
officer
to
be
able
to
perform
his
duties
without
impediment
by
the
state
is
a
federal
matter
of...
basic
to
the
whole
issue.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
is
exactly
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
get
at,
mr.
justice
white,
and
it
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
federal
interest
in
the
ultimate
issue
at
stake
and
the
federal
interest
in
an
issue
along
the
way,
that
the
issue,
the
ultimate
issue
at
stake
here
is
whether
or
not
this
letter
of
credit
has
been
breached,
and
whether
or
not
this
letter
of
credit
is
enforceable,
and
the
federal
government
doesn't
have
any
interest
in
that
question
at
all.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
it's
interest
in
making
sure
that
a
foreign
sovereign
does
not
get
mad
can
be
adequately
taken
care
of
through
appellate
review
of
state
court
determinations
on
non-federal
issues
with
non-diverse
parties.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
you
know,
the
state
has
an
interest,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
making
determinations
as
to
the
enforceability
of
contracts
within
its
state.
the
state
has
an
interest
in
that.
the
state...
the
states
kept
to
themselves
the
interest
to
exercise
those
interests
except
in
those
areas
where
there
was
a
federal
case
because
the
action
arose
under
the
laws
or
where
there
was
diversity.
here
you
don't
have
that.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
yes,
they
did.
every
now
and
again
congress
enacts
some
constitutional
statute.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
your
honor,
congress
clearly
in
the
arm
of
government
to
determine
what
its
federal
interest
is.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
and
this
court...
then
this
court
sits
to
ensure
that
the
congress
does
not
open
federal
courts
to
cases--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--if
it
calls
for--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--yes.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
yes.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
article
iii
of
the
constitution
which
provides
that
the
judicial
power
shall
exist
in
cases
or
controversies
where
there
is
a
case
arising
under
the
laws--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
says
congress
shall
establish
such
inferior
courts,
but
the
constitution
establishes
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states,
not
the
congress.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
your
honor,
the
article
iii--
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
--thank
you.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
this
case
shall
not
be
decided
by
this
court.
this
case
should
be
decided
by
this
court.
but
this
case
could
not
have
been
brought
as
a
matter
of
original
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
right.
it
was,
improperly,
and
this
court
will
have
to
decide
that.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
that
is
the
function
of
the
judiciary,
is
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
legislative
encroachments
on
the
judiciary.
just
as
this
court
can't
render
advisory
opinions,
district
courts
cannot
be
given
original
jurisdiction
over
non-federal
cases
which
are
not
diverse.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
if
it
means
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
have
to
be
a
citizen,
it
is
unconstitutional,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
statute
can
be
read
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
needs
be
an
american
citizen,
in
which
case
the
statute
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
the
statute
is
also
not
unconstitutional
when
the
claim
at
issue
is
a
federal
claim.
it
is
only
in
the
context
where
it
is
a
state
claim
that
is
involved.
mr.
stephen
n.
shulman
all
right.
thank
you.
in
the
tidewater
case,
the
petitioner's
argument
is
based
on
what
subsequent
commentary
has
shown
to
be
the
only
defensible
basis
for
the
decision,
but
there
was
no
majority
in
tidewater
in
favor
of
protective
jurisdiction.
and
in
lincoln
mills,
the
petitioner
also
turns
to
commentary
for
support,
but
the
majority
of
the
court
in
lincoln
mills
premised
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
there
would
be
a
federal
common
law
applied
which
is
an
action
arising
under,
and
the
federal
common
law
to
be
applied
was
on
the
subject
matter
that
the
cases
are
about,
which
is
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements,
the
ultimate
issue,
the
federal
issue
in
the
disposition
of
the
case.
here,
the
ultimate
disposition
is
simply
of
a
letter
of
credit.
that
is
not
a
matter
of
federal
law.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
statutory
law,
or
constitutional
law.
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
