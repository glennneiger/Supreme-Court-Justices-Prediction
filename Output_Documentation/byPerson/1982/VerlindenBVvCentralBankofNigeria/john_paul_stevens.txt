justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shulman,
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
let
me
assume
that
we
are
over
the
statutory
hurdle.
i
understand
you
rely
very
heavily
on
that.
and
then
to
the
constitutional
problem.
and
then
i
assume
also
with
you
that
the
allegation
under
the
federal
statute
is
that
the
immunity
question
is
a
defensive
question
rather
than
part
of
the
affirmative
claim.
would
you
nevertheless
agree
that
if
the
case
had
been
brought
in
a
state
court,
and
the
only
defense
was
sovereign
immunity,
that
there
would
be
appellate
jurisdiction
in
this
court
to
review
a
state
court
judgment
against
the
foreign
sovereign?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
not
then
follow
that
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii,
that
the
case
arises
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
letter
was
not
breached,
but
assume
they
enter
a
judgment
against
the
foreign
sovereign,
is
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
have
a
case
arising
under
this
constitutional
or
federal
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
don't
we
have
that
now,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
article
iii
doesn't
draw
that
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
that
is
true
as
a
statutory
matter,
but
just
confining
our
attention
to
the
language
of
the
first
few
words
of
article
iii,
section
2,
i
am
not
sure
that
you
don't
have
a
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
do
have
a
case
or
controversy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
case
would
not
have
been
reviewable
here,
either.
if
it
stayed
in
the
state
court,
and
there
was
no
federal...
no
defense
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
only
defense
was
that
we
paid
the
bill,
or
whatever
it
might
be,
there
would
be
no
federal
question
for
us
to
review.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
seems
to
me
that
as
long
as
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
is
maintained,
and
if
you
agree
that
we
would
have
appellate
jurisdiction
over
a
state
case
which
has
no
other
federal
question
in
it,
then
does
it
not
follow
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii
that
that
case
arises
under
federal
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
shulman,
in
your
reference
to
the
protective
jurisdiction,
you
took
care
of
the
first
three
problems,
but
you
didn't
get
to
tidwater.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
if
the
operation
of
an
embassy
is
a
proprietary
function.
