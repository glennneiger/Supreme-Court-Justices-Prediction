so
it
was
a...
do
you
think
it
was
grounded
in
the
constitution?
justice

we
don't
need
to
decide
the
case
on
any
broader
basis
for
you
to
win
than
to
say
that
the
congress
may
vest
the
decision
of
any
federal
question
on
that.

whether
it
is
in
defense
or--
justice
byron

white
why
is
that...
why
would
you
say
that
is
arising
under,
or
why
would
you
say
that...
certainly
the
substantive
rule
of
those
removal
cases
isn't
necessarily
federal
law.
justice

you
don't
think
the
federal
government
has
the
same
sort
of
an
interest
in
assuring
foreign
governments
that
they
can
litigate
in
the
right
forum?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
got
an
interest
in
not
making
some
foreign
government
made.
it
probably
has
more
of
an
interest
than
it
has
in
making
sure
some
employee
doesn't
get
mad.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
long
way
around
the
mulberry
bush,
isn't
it?
