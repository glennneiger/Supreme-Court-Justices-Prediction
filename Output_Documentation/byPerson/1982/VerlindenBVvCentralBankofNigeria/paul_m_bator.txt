mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
it
is
the
government's
submission
in
this
case
that
important
diplomatic
and
foreign
relations
interests
of
the
united
states
will
be
adversely
affected
if
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed,
and
if
suits
by
foreigners
against
foreign
countries
are
relegated
to
the
state
courts.
the
single
most
critical
proposition
relevant
to
this
case
is
one
that
oddly
enough
nobody
disputes
at
all.
that
proposition
is
that
it
is
for
congress
to
decide,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
whether
and
on
what
conditions
a
foreign
country
should
be
amenable
to
suit
in
an
american
court,
whether
by
a
plaintiff
or
an
american...
a
foreigner
or
an
american
citizen.
nobody
argues
that
this
question
is
reserved
to
the
states
or
is
governed
by
state
law.
under
its
regulatory
article
i
authority,
congress
has
power
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
the
diplomatic
foreign
relations
and
foreign
commerce
interests
of
the
united
states,
whether
foreign
countries
should
be
amenable
to
suit.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
there
would
be
an
antecedent
question
in
that
case,
justice
rehnquist,
which
is
whether
the
transaction
sued
on
has
such
connection
to
the
united
states
that
it
is
a
legitimate,
rational--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--well,
i
can
conceive
of
a
case
where
the
suit
by
a
foreigner
against
a
foreign
country
would
be
so
foreign
to
any
substantive
american
concern
whatever
that
it
shouldn't
be
in
an
american
court
at
all.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
is
conceivable
that
there
is
a
case
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
united
states,
and
where
it
shouldn't
be
in
an
american
court
at
all,
but
this
statute
and
this
case
is
so
far
from
that
extreme
problem
that
really
this
court,
i
think,
does
not
need
to
be
concerned
with
it.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
assume
that
the
relevant
question
whether
it
would
be
a
rational
judgment
by
congress
to
decide
that
in
regulating
the
foreign
relations
and
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states,
the
case
should
be
assigned
to
an
american
court.
i
would
say
that
that
would--
mr.
paul
m.
bator
--it
may
be...
it
may
be
that...
you
see,
if
the
case
is
going
to
be
in
an
american
court,
then
it
seems
to
me
there
clearly
must
be
protective
jurisdiction
to
put
it
in
a
federal
court.
that
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
question
could
be
divided
into
two
parts.
the
first...
and
the
concern
in
this
case
might
be
thought
of
in
two
stages.
the
first
is
under
what
circumstances
should
an
american
court
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate,
and
that
is
the
question
that
is
subject
to
congress's
regulatory
power.
now,
if
that
question
is
answered
in
the
affirmative,
that
the
transaction
between
the
foreigner
and
the
foreign
government
is
sufficiently
american
to
make
it
legitimate
to
authorize
an
american
court
to
adjudicate
it,
then
the
question
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
congress
nevertheless
to
leave
the
matter
to
a
state
court.
now,
on
that
point,
the
diplomatic
and
foreign
relations
interest
of
the
united
states
comes
into
play,
because
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
the
one
thing
that
was
clear
was
the
judgment
that
a
uniform,
sensitive
national
resolution
of
the
question
of
the
amenability
of
a
foreign
government
to
sue
in
the
courts
of
this
country
needed
a
federal
national
solution.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
no,
i
believe
i
misspoke
if
that
is
the
impression
i
gave.
i
think
that
this
is
a
clear
arising
under
case,
and
no,
the
court
does
not
need
to
go
into
fancy
problems
of
protective
jurisdiction.
why?
in
this
case,
congress
has
exercised
its
undoubted
article
i
regulatory
authority
to
create
a
regulatory
scheme,
which
is
the...
the
scheme
governing
the
amenability
of
foreign
governments
to
sue.
now,
if
there
is
one
thing
clear
about
the
arising
under
clause,
it
is
that
if
congress
has
an
article
i
power
to
create
a
regulatory
scheme,
it
has
a
matching
article
iii
power
under
the
arising
under
clause
to
call
on
federal
trial
courts
to
apply
and
interpret
and
enforce
that
scheme.
that
is,
the
surprising
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
that
although
congress
has
power
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
to
regulate
the
question
of
amenability,
the
constitution
requires
it
to
leave
the
enforcement
of
its
regulatory
scheme
to
a
state
court.
now,
it
is
that
proposition
that
turns
the
osborn
case
on
its
head.
in
this
case,
the
court
does
not
need
to
worry
about
some
of
the
more
far-reaching
conclusions
of
chief
justice
marshall
in
osborn,
just
as
it
doesn't,
i
think,
really
need
to
worry
about
protective
jurisdiction,
because
this
case
is
within
the
core
of
the
arising
under
clause
as
interpreted
in
osborn.
in
this
case,
congress
has
enacted
a
comprehensive
statute
which
governs
this
important
and
sensitive
diplomatic
issue,
and
now
it
says
the
enforcement
of
that
question
and
the
decision
of
issues
under
this
statute
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
courts.
under
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
we
are
in
this
really
anomalous
situation.
that
judgment
says
that
this
plaintiff
must
now
sue
nigeria
in
a
state
court.
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
state
court?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
could
be
removed,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
in
order
for
the
case
to
be
removable
by
the
foreign
government,
it
would
have
to
first
be
determined
that
it
is
a
case
arising
under
federal
law
for
purposes
of
article
iii.
that
is
to
say,
if
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
the
way
it
confers
original
jurisdiction,
it
would
be
very
hard
to
see
how
it
is
constitutional
in
allowing
a
defendant
to
remove
the
case
to
federal
court.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
arises
directly,
as
chief
justice
marshall
explicated
the
clause,
under
this
act
because
in
order
for
this
case
to
be
in
the
court,
at
the
forefront
of
the
case,
the
district
court
must
decide
the
applicability
and
the
meaning
of
this
regulatory
scheme
which
congress
enacted
pursuant
to
its
article
i
power.
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case.
it
wrote
an
elaborate
opinion
on
the
question
whether
nigeria's
contacts
in
this
case
were
sufficient
to
lift
its
immunity.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
congress
permitted
plaintiffs
to
choose
a
state
court,
but
congress
very
plainly
said
that
in
any
case
where
the
plaintiff
chooses
a
state
court,
the
defendant
foreign
government
has
an
automatic
right
to
take
it
to
federal
court,
and
congress
in
its
reports
made
it
very
clear
why
it
wished
that
removal
power
to
exist.
the
report
of
the
senate
and
the
house
says,
in
view
of
the
potential
sensitivity
of
actions
against
foreign
states
and
the
importance
of
developing
a
uniform
body
of
law
in
this
area,
it
is
important
to
give
foreign
states
clear
authority
to
remove
to
a
federal
forum
actions
brought
against
it.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
congress
did
not
feel
it
wanted
to
cut
down
on
the
plaintiff's
right
to
choose
a
forum
if
the
foreign
government
agreed
to
stay
in
state
court.
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
it's
very
significant,
because
we
are
informed
by
the
state
department
that
it
is
absolutely
routine
for
foreign
countries
to
remove
these
cases,
because
foreign
countries
themselves
have
given
ample
notice
that
they
want
suits
against
them
brought
in
the
court
of
national
dignity.
and
that
was
another
reason
for
the
enactment
of
this
statute.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
