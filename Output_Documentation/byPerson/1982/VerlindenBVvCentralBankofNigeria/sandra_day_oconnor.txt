justice

day
o'connor
mr.
chayes,
is
the
absence
of
sovereign
immunity
as
defined
in
the
act
an
element
of
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action,
or
is
it
an
affirmative
defense,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
was
that,
mr.
chayes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
what
provision
of
the
constitution
would
you
determine
under
justice
rehnquist's
example
that
it
could
not
be
in
the
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
would
have
to
rest
it
on
the
federal
protective
jurisdiction
concept.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
your
view,
mr.
bator,
as
i
understand
it,
then,
you
think
we
cannot
simply
resolve
the
case
by
dealing
with
the
arising
under
question
discussed
by
mr.
chayes,
but
in
fact
have
to
also
discuss
the
protective
jurisdiction
question.
is
that
right?
