justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
a
foreign
country
had
no
assets
in
this
country,
how
would
you--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
statute
requires
it.
the
statute
requires
that
there
be
no
immunity.
section
3,
1330a.
doesn't
it
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
is
not
entitled
to
immunity.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
statute
says
it,
you
certainly
have
to
allege
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
says
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
didn't
the
complaint
set
forth
the
reasons
against
sovereign
immunity?
they
went
into
a
little
detail
on
it,
didn't
they?
or
did
i
read
it
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
a
couple
of
weeks
ago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
trying
to
see
how
much
of
an
issue
this
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
congress
say
that
they
had
an
interest
in
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
better...
what
better
area
of
government
is
to
determine
that,
what
the
federal
interest
is,
than
congress?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
congress
said
that
in
this
type
of
case,
the
federal
courts
shall
be
open
to
this
type
of
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
it
violates
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
action
of
congress?
does--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
violate
the
constitution--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--what
provision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
it
also
say
congress
shall
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
in
the
constitution
decided
that
you
cannot
determine
this
action,
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
will
make
the
question
simpler.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what,
if
anything,
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
this
case
shall
not
be
decided
by
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
we
will.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
statute
unconstitutional?
