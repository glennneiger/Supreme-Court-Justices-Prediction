justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
chayes,
before
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
there
would
have
been
no
jurisdictional
basis
for
a
federal
court
to
entertain
this
particular
suit,
would
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
chayes,
you
made
the
statement
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
act
to
concentrate
the
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
opposed
to
state
court
suits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
under
article
i
congress
could
simply
pass
a
statute
that
said
any
time
a
foreign
government
wants
to
sue
or
be...
or
someone
wants
to
sue
a
foreign
government
in
this
country,
we
aren't
laying
down
any
sort
of
law
at
all
to
govern
the
suits,
but
the
federal
district
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
congress
said,
we
don't
care
whether
the
transaction
had
any
rational
connection.
we
want
all
such
suits
brought
here.
and
in
this
particular
case
there
was
no
connection
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
congress
had
said
it
should?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
with
you
on
that
point,
did
it?
i
mean,
it...
i
take
it
it
would
have
liked
to
construe
the
statute
that
way,
but
it
felt
it
just
couldn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
according
to
mr.
chayes,
to
properly
plead
a
case
that
will
entitle
you...
the
district
court
to
have
jurisdiction,
you
have
to
plead
not
only
that
it
is
a
foreign
sovereign,
but
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
immunity.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
have
to
allege
all
of
the
jurisdictional
elements?
for
instance,
in
a
diversity
case,
i
take
it
you
have
to
allege
that
a
is
a
citizen
of
connecticut,
b
is
a
citizen
of
rhode
island,
and
there
is
more
than
whatever
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement
is
in
controversy.
analogously
to
that,
wouldn't
you
have
to
allege
in
your
jurisdictional
allegations
here
that
this
claim
is
one
with
respect
to
which
the
foreign
state
is
not
entitled
to
immunity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
the
difference
is,
diversity,
the
diversity
statute
confers
jurisdiction
only,
without
any
substantive
requirement.
here
you
do
have
the
substantive
requirement
that
is
in
effect
part
of
a
jurisdictional
requirement
that
the
claim
of
sovereign
immunity
be
not
substantively
made
out
under
the
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
has
to
be
a
line
somewhere.
how
about
the
federal
arbitration
act?
all
you
have
to
allege
is
that
it
is
a
contract,
and
provides
for
arbitration.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
yes,
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
is
a
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction.
didn't
the
polygraph
case,
that
bernhard
against
polygraph--
