mr.
abram
chayes
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
may
appear
at
first
glance
to
be
a
technical
and
abstract
one,
but
it
touches
directly
and
deeply
the
power
of
the
national
government
to
regulate
and
protect
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.
congress
in
1976,
acting
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers
over
foreign
affairs
and
foreign
commerce,
enacted
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
which
was
comprehensive
legislation
establishing
circumstances
and
conditions
in
which
suit
may
be
brought
in
the
courts
of
this
country
against
foreign
sovereigns
and
the
procedures
regulating
such
suits.
the
question
here
is
whether
as
an
aspect
of
this
legislation
congress
can,
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
ensure
that
all
such
suits
against
foreign
sovereigns
may
be
brought
in
the
federal
courts,
the
courts
of
the
nation.
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit,
held
that
there
was
an
impenetrable
constitutional
barrier
to
this
congressional
choice.
why?
the
plaintiff
here,
petitioner
in
this
court,
is
verlinden
b.
v.,
a
dutch
corporation.
thus,
the
suit
is
between
a
foreign
corporation
and
a
foreign
sovereign.
the
diversity
clauses
of
article
iii
do
not
cover
such
a
suit.
they
cover
suits
between
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
a
foreign
sovereign,
but
not
between
an
alien
and
a
foreign
sovereign.
so
recourse
must
be
had
to
the
arising
underclause
of
article
iii
which
grants
jurisdiction
in
a
constitutional
sense
to
the
federal
judiciary
over
suits
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
but
judge
kaufmann
below
held
that
this
case
does
not
arise
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
so
he
dismissed
on
the
constitutional
grounds.
it
is
our
contention
here
and
the
main
proposition
in
this
case
that
the
case
does
indeed
arise
under
a
law
of
the
united
states,
and
that
law
is
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act.
jurisdiction
in
this--
mr.
abram
chayes
--absent
that
act
we
don't
believe
there
would
be
jurisdiction.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
sir.
jurisdiction
in
this
case
is
founded
on
the
special
jurisdictional
section
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
that
codified
in
28
usc
1330;
and
that
provides
for
original
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
without
regard
to
a
mounting
controversy
of
any
nonjury
civil
action
against
a
foreign
state
with
respect
to
which
the
foreign
state
is
not
entitled
to
immunity.
so
in
order
for
jurisdiction
to
attach,
the
foreign
state
defendant
must
be
one...
must
be
not
entitled
to
immunity
with
respect
to
the
claim
asserted.
mr.
abram
chayes
we
believe
it
is
an
element
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
because
it
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement
under
1330
that
sovereign
immunity
must
be
absent
the
federal
rules,
and
in
the
absence
of
the
federal
rules,
general
pleading
principles
require
that
the
plaintiff
plead
and
prove
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
order
to
establish
his
case.
we
did
so
in
this
case.
the
situation
is
such
that
the
defendant
cannot
waive
or
concede
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
because
as
we
know
and
as
happened
in
this
case,
the
absence
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
can
be
raised
by
the
court
sua
sponte
or
by
any
party
at
any
time
during
the
course
of
the
case;
and
that's
what
happened
here.
so...
and
the
act
provides,
indeed,
that
in
case
of
a
default
the
court
must
determine
that...
on
the
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
recover,
which
means
that
he
must
determine
that
there
is
no
immunity.
and
the
cases
in
the
lower
courts
in
which
there
have
been
defaults
have
followed
that
practice.
so
that
within
the
narrowest
notion
of
the
arising
underclause,
as
your
honor
suggested,
the
federal
question
of
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
defendant
is
a
central
element
of
plaintiff's
claim...
of
plaintiff's
case
in
every
instance
arising
under
the
act.
but
i
should
say
that
the
act
is
much
more
than
a
jurisdictional
statute
or
a
mere
authorization
to
sue.
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
represents
a
major
departure
in
u.s.
policy.
until
the
act
was
passed,
the
ability
of
a
private
party
to
sue
a
foreign
state
was
totally
a
matter
of
the
discretion
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
national
government.
no
case
against
a
foreign
state
could
be
brought
in
a
state
or
federal
court
where
the
executive
branch
suggested
immunity.
now,
up
until--
mr.
abram
chayes
--well,
that
was
because
of
the
opinions
of
this
court.
mr.
abram
chayes
no.
the
doctrine
dates,
of
course,
from
the
schooner
exchange,
one
of
chief
justice
marshall's
great
opinions,
in
which,
alluding
to
the
fact,
which
has
been
a
dominant
theme
in
sovereign
immunity
jurisprudence,
that
every
case
against
a
foreign
sovereign
touches
the
dignity
of
the
foreign
sovereign,
and
involves
the
foreign
relations
of
the
country,
justice
marshall
established
the
principle
in
the
schooner
exchange
that
foreign
sovereigns
were
absolutely
immune.
that
is,
no
case
of
any
kind
could
be
brought
against
a
foreign
sovereign
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
in
cases
that
arose
from
time
to
time,
for
example,
when
a
case
was
initiated
by
the
attachment
of
a
commercial
vessel
owned
by
the
foreign
sovereign,
the
sovereign
might
appeal
to
the
department
of
state
to
suggest
immunity.
that
is
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
immunity
was
appropriate.
when
the
state
department--
mr.
abram
chayes
--it
is
not
clear,
your
honor.
that
is,
until
1952,
there
were
no
in
personam
jurisdiction
against
a
foreign
sovereign.
the
cases
were
begun
by
attachment
of
a
foreign
sovereign's
property,
but
i
think
you
are
correct.
it
is
what...
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
earlier.
until
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
was
enacted,
it
does
not
appear
that
there
was
jurisdiction
for
a
suit
by
an
alien
versus
a
foreign
sovereign,
although
i
can't
say
for
sure
that
no
such
cases
were
brought.
in
1952,
as
you
know,
again,
as
a
matter
of
executive
policy,
the
united
states
government
adopted
the
restrictive
view
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
state
department
indicated
that
it
would
not
suggest
immunity
in
cases
growing
out
of
the
commercial
acts
of
foreign
sovereigns.
but
that
was
an
act
of
grace
on
the
part
of
the
department
of
state.
the
department
of
state
was
not
bound
by
that,
and
in
fact
in
some
cases
involving
commercial
acts
the
state
department
did
suggest
immunity.
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
tells
us
that
the
court,
this
court,
the
state
courts,
and
the
federal
courts
were
bound
by
the
executive...
by
the
executive
suggestion
and
could
not
disregard
it,
and
in
the
absence
of
a
suggestion,
the
republic
of
mexico
versus
hoffman
tells
us
that
the
court
had
to
follow
the
policies
enunciated
by
the
state
department.
but
as
i
said,
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
has
changed
all
of
that.
in
the
first
instance,
it
judicializes
the
whole
field
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity,
and
remits
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity
to
judicial
determination.
second,
it
codifies
the
restrictive
theory
of
immunity,
and
subjects
foreign
sovereigns
to
suit
in
cases
arising
out
of
commercial
transactions,
ordinary
torts,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
directly
parallel,
both
in
concept
and
language,
to
the
tucker
act
and
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
by
which
the
united
states
has
consented
to
sue
against
itself.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes.
exactly
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact,
we
used
to
talk
about
it
in
latin
and
call
it
use
imperii
and
use
guesti,
but
it
was
the
same
general
kind
of
distinction.
that
is,
now
the
act
doesn't
quite
take
the
old
line.
it
says,
when
the
foreign
sovereign
makes
a
contract,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
is
a
contract
for
guns
for
the
army
or
for
wheat
for
the
starving
poor,
that
is
contract,
and
the
government
ought
to
respond
according
to
the
laws
of
contract.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
contract
is.
or
if
the
ambassador's
car
strikes
a
person,
the
government
ought
to
be
liable,
even
though
that
was
the
ambassador
carrying
out
political
functions
of
the
government.
but
it's
the
same
general
conception,
your
honor.
mr.
abram
chayes
you
could
not
enforce
if
there
were
no
assets.
of
course,
the
situation
until
the
enactment
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
in
1976
was,
you
could
never
get
attachment
against
foreign
assets.
one
of
the
major
departures
of
the
act
was
to
provide
for
enforcement
of
the
judgment
by
attachment
of
the
assets.
the
act
also
defined
the
causes
of
action
which
would
lie
against
the
foreign
sovereign
and
the
extent
of
liability,
so
that
we
see
here
an
extended,
comprehensive
legislative
pattern,
legislative
structure
dealing
with
the
entire
range
of
actions
against
a
foreign
sovereign
expressly
made
binding
on
both
state
and
federal
courts
as
a
pre-emptive
exercise
of
federal
supreme
legislative
power.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
case
falls
within
the
statute.
it
arises...
it
is
a
suit
on
a
contract,
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
cement.
the
defendant
was...
the
central
bank
of
nigeria
is
a
foreign
sovereign.
it
repudiated
the
letter
of
credit
that
financed
the
contract.
the
whole
thing
was
a
commercial
transaction.
the
court
below
in
identical
cases
involving
u.s.
corporate
plaintiffs
held
that
the
contacts
with
the
united
states
were
sufficient
to
bring
this
transaction
within
the
purview
of
section
1605(a)(2)
of
the
act
dealing
with
commercial
claims.
and
second,
the
act
applies
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
to
suits...
statutory
interpretation,
to
suits
against
an
alien...
excuse
me,
suits
brought
by
an
alien
against
a
foreign
sovereign.
the
statute
says
that.
it
says
any
civil
action.
both
courts
below
agreed
that
the
statute
extends
to
suits
brought
by
an
alien
plaintiff.
the
government's
brief,
which
represents
the
views
of
the
justice
department
and
the
state
department,
the
two
executive
departments
that
were
the
draftsmen
of
the
act,
agrees
that
the
statute
extends
to
suits
by
an
alien.
it
is
the
only
way
that
congress
could
have
fulfilled
its
twin
purposes,
which
were
to
provide
judicial
protection
for
american
business
enterprise
in
the
courts
in
suits
against
a
foreign
sovereign,
and
at
the
same
time
to
concentrate
that
litigation
in
the
federal
courts.
and
finally,
i
think
it
makes...
it
is
important
to
note
at
this
point
that
there
is
no
problem
here
of
opening
the
floodgates
to
a
whole
series
of
suits
with
which
the
united
states
has
no
connection,
no
interest,
no
concern.
that
would
be
inappropriate
for
determination
by
the
federal
courts.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes,
sir.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
the
court...
the
act
permits
suit
in
the
state
court,
but
subject
to
a
power
of
removal
by
the
foreign
defendant,
so
any
suit
begun
in
a
state
court
may
be
removed
by
the
foreign
defendant
at
any
time.
it
is
not
subject
to
the
usual
time
limit
on
removal.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
of
course,
that
most
actions
that
have
been
begun
in
state
courts
have
in
fact
been
removed,
and
the
congress
in
the
legislative
history
stated
that
the
purpose
of
the
removal
jurisdiction
was
to
provide
for
concentration
of
the
suits...
of
the
litigation
in
the
federal
courts,
for
two
reasons.
first,
to
ensure
uniformity
of
decision,
and
second,
to
ensure
that
the
delicacy
and
sensitivity
of
the
question
of
suits
against
a
foreign
sovereign
would
be
recognized
in
the
courts
of
the
nation,
the
nation
being
the
one
that
bears
international
responsibility
for
the
acts
of
the
judicial
department.
so,
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
do
want
to
say
that...
what
i
started,
that
there
is
no
problem
here
of
a
flood
of
litigation
that
would
be
inappropriate
for
determination
in
the
federal
courts.
congress
established
a
different
set
of
thresholds
and
limits
than
the
party
plaintiff.
it
required
in
1605(a)
and
1605,
6,
and
7,
the
statutes
withdrawing...
the
sections
withdrawing
immunity,
it
required
that
for
immunity
to
be
withdrawn,
the
transaction
in
suit
had
to
have
substantial
connection
with
the
united
states,
as
was
the
case
here,
where
the
transaction
was
financed
through
the
morgan
bank
in
new
york.
so,
the
alien
will
not
be
able
to
bring
suit
unless
the
transaction
has
substantial
connection
with
the
united
states,
and
once
that
is
so,
it
seems
to
me
hard
to
argue
that
suits
against
a
foreign
sovereign
are
not
most
appropriate
for
determination
in
the
federal
courts.
that
goes
all
the
way
back
to
alexander
hamilton,
who
in
the
81st
federalist
said
that
since
the
nation
will
be
responsible
for
the
judgment
of
its
courts
in
suits
touching
foreign
citizens
and
foreign
affairs,
the
nation...
the
courts
of
the
nation
should
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
them.
we
maintain
that
the
statute
as
so
construed
is
constitutional.
it
is
constitutional
for
the
reason
i
gave
in
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
that
the
plaintiff's
case
contains
a
necessary
federal
element,
the
absence
of
immunity,
and
it
is
constitutional
under
the
teaching
of
the
osborn
case,
which
says
that
where
congress
has
legislated
on
a
matter
within
its
competence,
here
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states,
and
has
legislated
comprehensively,
it
may
grant
jurisdiction
to
cases
arising
within
that...
within
the
ambit
of
that
legislative
program,
even
though
the
particular
case
may
not
be
governed
on
the
merits
by
federal
law.
so,
for
those
two
reasons,
it
seems
to
me
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
makes
it
clear
that
the
statute
as
construed
is
constitutional,
and
this
cases
arises
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
article
iii.
mr.
abram
chayes
yes.
i
will...
i--
mr.
abram
chayes
--that
is
correct.
you
don't
have
to
decide
it
on
any
broader
basis
than
the
basis
that
was
involved
in
my
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
and
we
feel
that
on
that
basis
it
is
a
very
easy
case.
it
is
no
different
than
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
in
which...
which
this
court
has
said
cases
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act
arise
under
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
that
is
exactly
what
this
is.
and
therefore,
although
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
the
osborn
rationale
covers
this
case,
you
are
quite
right,
justice
white,
that
you
don't
have
to
go
anywhere
near
that
far
to
decide
in
our
favor.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
your
honor.
that
issue
was
decided
in
the
consolidated
appeal
below,
with
respect
to
five
cases
that
were
identical
in
terms
of
substantial
connection
with
this
case.
all
of
those
five
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
found,
had
the
substantial
connection,
in
texas
trading,
texas
milling
and
trading
versus
the
republic
of
nigeria.
the
only
thing
that
differentiated
those
five
cases
from
this
one
was
the
citizenship
of
the
plaintiff,
and
the
legislative
history
says
that
the
citizenship
of
the
plaintiff
should
not
constitute
a
connection,
and
of
course
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
under
international
shoe
suggests
the
same
thing.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
your
honors,
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
abram
chayes
mr.
chief
justice...
thank
you.
first,
as
to
your
question
whether
this
case
could
have
been
brought
before
1976,
the
answer
is
no.
what
happened
in
1976
was
that
the
congress
exercised
its
article
i
legislative
power,
and
by
doing
so
created
as
an
essential
aspect,
as
an
essential
part
of
the
plaintiff's
case
here
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity.
as
justice
marshall
suggested,
that
was
pleaded
in
our
complaint.
at
8a
in
the
record,
the
jurisdictional
paragraph
refers
to
section
1330,
and
if
you
look
at
paragraphs
7
to
15...
to
12
of
the
record
and
then
throughout
the
record,
you
will
see
allegations
of
connections
with
the
united
states
designed
to
show
that
the
claim
is
a
proprietary...
based
on
a
proprietary
rather
than
a
governmental
action,
and
that
it
falls
within
1605(a)(2).
that
this
is
an
essential
part
of
the
plaintiff's
case
is
proved
by
the
mine
versus
guinea
case,
the
very
case
that
provided
the
basis
of
the
amicus
suggestion
of
interest.
that
case
has
been
dismissed
below
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia.
although
it
raised
the
same
issue
that
was
here,
the
court
of
appeals
never
reached
that
issue,
because
it
found,
examining
the
issue
of
immunity,
that
guinea
was
immune
in
that
case,
and
therefore
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
it
dismissed.
it
did
that
not
as
a
matter
of
defense
on
the
merits,
but
as
a
threshold
question
at
the
outset
of
the
case,
just
as
we
contend
and
as
justice
o'connor
suggested
in
her
question.
now,
i
would
like
to
leave
with
the
court
the
following
point.
these
cases
will
not
go
away
if
the
court
sustains
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
these
cases
will
not
just
disappear.
they
go
to
the
state
courts.
we
can
imagine
a
case
in
which
olympian
york
company
owns...
a
canadian
company
owns
real
estate
in
the
city
of
new
york.
an
embassy
in
the
u.n.
rents
real
estate
from
the
company,
and
doesn't
pay
its
rent.
the
company
has
to
sue
it
if
the...
judge
kaufman's
opinion
is
right
in
the
housing
court
of
the
city
of
new
york.
that
is,
the
foreign
sovereign
has
to
be
dragged
into
the
housing
court
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
defend
its
lease.
mr.
abram
chayes
no,
because
it
is
a
lease,
and
it
would
be
a
commercial
contract
within
the
meaning
of
1605(a)(2).
and
there
would
be
no
removal,
because,
as
said
before,
if
there
is
no
original
jurisdiction
constitutionally,
there
can
be
no
removal.
thank
you,
your
honor.
