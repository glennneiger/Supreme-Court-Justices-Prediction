justice
thurgood
marshall
on
what
basis
is
it
alleged
that
he
changed
his
mind?
did
he
say,
i
change
my
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
did
we
get
the
conclusion
that
he
did
change
his
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
testimony
also
undisputed
that
before
that,
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
that
he
didn't
get
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
he
didn't
get
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
record
show
that
he
didn't
get
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
he
was
continually
questioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
where
the
waiver
comes
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
initiation
you
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is...
the
initiation
comes
in,
you
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
that?
what
is
initiation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
see.
well,
suppose
he
had
asked
for
a
drink
of
water.
that
would
have
done
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
he...
as
i
understand
the
question,
what
are
you
going
to
take...
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me?
i
don't
see
anything
in
his
statement
that
said
i
want
to
be
questioned.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't...
is
there
anything
in
there
to
suggest
that
to
you,
that
i
want
to
be
questioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes
or
no.
if
you
say
yes,
then
point
it
out
to
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that's
out
of
context.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that
is
out
of
context.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
rule
about
not
asking
any
questions
after
asking
for
a
lawyer
did
not
originate
with
edwards.
it
goes
back
to
around
1935,
in
the
handbook
of
fbi
agents,
which
was
quoted
in
the
miranda
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
it
was
way
back.
it's
not
new.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
miranda
doctrine,
i
thought,
said
that
when
he
asked,
when
he
says
i
want
a
lawyer,
you
quit
questioning.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he
says,
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep,
would
that
do
it?
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
then
there
is
some
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
tell
you
one.
he
says
what
happens
to
me
now,
you
say
you
sit
down
and
wait
for
your
lawyer.
wouldn't
that
be
a
good
response?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
just
gave
him
the
same
miranda
warning
over
again,
the
boiler
plate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
this
16
and
17,
what
was
this,
a
hearing
or
the
trial
itself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
page...
you
just
read
from
page
17.
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
the
joint
appendix.
justice
thurgood
marshall
sixteen
and
17
and
18,
around
in
there.
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
testimony
there.
oh,
that
was
a
pretrial
hearing.
