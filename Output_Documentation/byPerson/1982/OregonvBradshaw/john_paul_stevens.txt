justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
one
question?
does
the
record
tell
us
when
he
first
got
the
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
evidence
that
the
state
made
any
effort
to
get
him
counsel
before
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
was
he
represented
by
retained
counsel
in
the
proceeding
that
followed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was
represented
by
appointed
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so...
but
no
effort
was
made
to
obtain
appointed
counsel
until
after
his
arraignment,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
clear
up
one
other
factual
matter.
is
it
not
correct
that
he
was
handcuffed
before
he
said
he
wanted
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
a
dispute
on
whether
he
said
that
in
the
police
station
or
not.
you
seem
to
just
totally
overlook
his
own
testimony,
which
the
court
of
appeals
said
he
recalled
it
as
being
in
the
car.
you
are
concentrating
on
the
police
officer's
testimony.
each
of
them
testified
contrary
to
his
own
interest,
i
guess,
but
the
court
of
appeals,
as
justice
rehnquist
has
pointed
out,
says
in
so
many
words
defendant
recalls
this
was
while
he
was
enroute
by
automobile
from
the
police
station
to
the
county
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
that's
referring
to
the
well,
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
now,
which
i
guess
must
also...
the
sequence
is
very
puzzling
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
the
one
who
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
proximity
in
time
and
that's
why
it
seemed
to
me
you
ought
to
be
pretty
sure
of
your
facts.
