justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if...
suppose
he
said,
i
want
a
lawyer
and
the
police
terminated,
said
all
right,
the
discussion
is
over,
and
the
defendant
then
says
well,
when
am
i
going
to
get
my
lawyer?
now,
is
that
reopening
the
dialogue?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
i'm
interested
in
what
you
think
reopening
the
dialogue
is.
that
would
be
any
kind
of,
any
way
in
which
he...
any
subject
that
he
reopens
with
the
police
like--
justice
byron
r.
white
--please
tell
my
mother,
or
could
i
have
a
drink
of
water
or
give
me
some
writing
paper,
that's
reopening
a
conversation?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
a
question
about
when
am
i
going
to
get
the
lawyer
that
i
just
asked
you
for,
that
reopens
the
dialogue?
because
it
calls
for
some
kind
of
a
response?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it's
just
a
question
of
voluntariness
and
the
totality
of
the
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand.
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
version
of
the
record,
or
do
you
think
it's
important,
as
to
when
bradshaw
asked
him
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
were?
what's
your
view
of
when
it
took
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
course,
the
officer
testified
that
he...
he
then
asked
me
at
this
time,
which
was
at
the
end
of
the
tape
recording,
i
handcuffed
him
there
and
then
he
asked
me,
at
this
time.
but
there's
testimony
of
hays'--
--i
understand
that.
i'm
trying...
wonder
what
your
view
is.
it
is
one
or
the
other,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
which.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't
matter...
in
your
view
it
could
have
happened
in
the
police
car
and
it
wouldn't
make
a
bit
of
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
the
station,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
