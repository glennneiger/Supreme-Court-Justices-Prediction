mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
today,
the
state
of
oregon
asks
this
court
to
finetune
a
salutary
rule
in
order
to
make
it
more
workable
in
the
real
world.
the
question
is
whether
miranda
versus
arizona
allows
reasonable
police
investigation
into
serious
crime,
including
allowing
the
innocent
to
clear
their
names
from
suspicion,
or
whether
the
miranda
and
edwards
doctrines
will
be
misconstrued
to
imprison
potential
suspects
in
a
web
of
their
privileges
or
prohibit
them
from
changing
their
minds.
this
case
is
here
today
because
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
overextended
edwards
versus
arizona
and
distorted
the
very
protections
this
court
established
in
miranda
versus
arizona.
the
facts,
i
believe,
may
be
briefly
summarized.
bradshaw's
contact
with
law
enforcement
authorities
arose
both
because
he
was
a
suspect
in
a
vehicular
homicide
and
because
he
claimed
to
have
been
the
victim
of
a
criminal
assault.
at
the
request
of
the
oregon
state
police,
he
answered
questions
about
inconsistencies
between
the
story
he
had
volunteered
and
the
accounts
of
other
witnesses.
prior
to
this
questioning,
he
was
advised
of
his
miranda
rights
and
he
was
told
that
he
was
not
under
arrest
and
that
he
was
free
to
leave.
based
on
certain
admissions
that
bradshaw
made
during
questioning
at
the
rockaway
police
station,
corporal
hays
then
placed
him
under
arrest
for
furnishing
liquor
to
a
minor
and
advised
him
again
of
his
miranda
rights.
shortly
thereafter,
when
corporal
hays
suggested
to
the
accused
a
theory
that
bradshaw
had
been
the
driver
of
the
car
and
was
responsible
for
the
homicide,
bradshaw
stated
he
wanted
an
attorney
"before
it
goes
very
much
further.
"
the
interview
was
promptly
terminated
and
bradshaw
was
transported
to
tillamook
county
jail
for
booking.
at
some
point
during
this
process,
bradshaw
asked
the
question,
"well,
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
now?
"
the
testimony
is
unchallenged
that
corporal
hays
then
immediately
reminded
the
accused
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
that
he
did
not
have
to
talk.
bradshaw
stated,
"i
understand".
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
as
far
as
the
record
is
clear,
your
honor,
he
first
received
actual
counsel
sometime
after
his
arraignment
the
following
day.
there
is
no
point
in
this
exchange
i've
described
at
which
counsel
was
available.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
there
is
evidence
that
the
state...
there
is
not
only
evidence,
there
is
testimony
by
corporal
hays
that
he
suggested
that
he
call
an
attorney
and
corporal
hays
further
testified
that
he
believed
that
there
was
time
for
him
during
his
stay
at
the
station
house
to
have
called
an
attorney.
and
the
record
also
shows
that
the
police
contacted,
at
the
request
of
the
accused,
bradshaw,
a
person
by
the
name
of
irma
stockdale,
but
beyond
that,
the
record
is
silent
with
respect
to--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i
do
not
believe
so,
no.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that's
correct,
bearing
in
mind,
of
course,
that
the
events
i'm
describing
occurred
on
a
sunday
evening,
during
the
weekend
period
of
time
in
a
small
town
on
the
oregon
coast.
the
interview...
testimony
is
unchallenged
that,
of
course,
the
accused
was
immediately
reminded
that
he
did
not
have
to
talk
and
that
he
had
the
right
to
an
attorney.
bradshaw
stated
that
he
understood.
in
the
wide-ranging
conversation
that
then
ensued
in
the
drive
to
the
tillamook
county
jail,
no
incriminating
statements
were
elicited,
but
bradshaw
did
agree
to
take
a
polygraph
test
the
next
morning
to
test
the
veracity
of
his
story.
the
next
morning,
which
was
a
monday
morning,
another
oregon
state
police
officer
explained
to
bradshaw
the
polygraph
test
procedures
and
readvised
him
again
of
his
miranda
rights.
he
told
bradshaw
that
although
he
waived
the
right
to
counsel
he
could
stop
the
test
and
speak
to
an
attorney
at
any
time.
bradshaw
then
signed
a
written
acknowledgement
and
waiver
of
his
rights.
the
waiver
included
both
a
consent
to
take
the
polygraph
test
and
a
consent
to
talk
to
the
oregon
state
police.
after
the
test
and
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
initiated
by
defendant's
questions
relating
to
polygraph
procedures,
bradshaw
ultimately
made
the
incriminating
admissions
which
are
in
issue
today.
the
trial
court
found
after
hearing
testimony
concerning
these
events
that
there
had
been
no
threats,
promises
or
inducements
leading
to
these
admissions,
and
that
although
bradshaw
had
once
expressed
a
desire
for
counsel,
he
had
simply
changed
his
mind.
we
come
to
the
court
today
with
three
contentions,
which
i
would
like
to
argue
in
reverse
order
to
the--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--no,
he
didn't
say
that
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
the
trial
court,
of
course,
heard
the
testimony
of
the
corporal,
and
the
defendant
was
present
in
the
courtroom,
and
then
various
of
the
other
police
officers.
and
among
the
facts
that
the
court
was
entitled
to
consider
were
these:
the
defendant,
by
the
time
he
made
these
statements,
had
been
twice
advised
of
his
miranda
rights
and
after
he
asked
the
question,
"what
is
going
to
happen
to
me?
"
he
was
reminded
again
immediately
by
corporal
hays
that
he
had
the
right
to
counsel
and
that
he
did
not
need
to
talk
to
the
police
officer,
and
that
the
testimony
is
uncontroverted
that
he
then
said,
"i
understand".
further
evidence--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--it
is
undisputed
that
he
said,
"i
would
like
an
attorney
before
it
goes
very
much
further.
"
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
but
the
interview
was
promptly
terminated--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes,
the
record
shows
that
he
did
not
get
one.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
sir.
the
questioning
was
promptly
ceased.
corporal
hays
terminated
the
interview
as
soon
as
he
said
"i
want
an
attorney
before
this
goes
very
much
further.
"
it
was
only
when
the
accused
reinitiated
conversation
by
saying
"what
is
going
to
happen
to
me?
"
that
there
is
any
further
dialogue
between
the
police
officer
and
the
accused,
so
far
as
the
record
reflects.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
that's
where
the
initiation
comes
in
and
that's
where
the
waiver
faults.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
what,
i'm
sorry--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--the
initiation,
and
that
is
our
first--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--the
initiation
of
dialogue
between
the
accused
and
the
police.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
might
well
have
been
the
initiation
of
dialogue
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
decision
in
edwards
versus
arizona,
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
are
here
to
determine
today
and
that
is
our
first
contention.
our
contention
is,
in
fact,
that
the
edwards
case
should
squarely
have
controlled
the
disposition
by
this
case
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
but
that
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
misconstrued
this
court's
decision
in
edwards
versus
arizona,
misapplied
it
and
completely
ignored
the
carefully
tailored
footnote
9
of
that
decision.
in
that
decision,
the
edwards
decision,
this
court
stated,
as
an
exception
to
its
rule,
that
further
communications,
exchanges
or
conversations
by
the
police
would
be
an
exception
if
they
were
initiated
by
the
accused
and
of
course,
this
is
precisely
what
happened
in
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
today.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
think
that--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--let
me
answer
your
question--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--there
are
two
separate
questions...
there
are
two
separate
responses
to
your
question,
if
i
may,
and
they
are
terribly
important
so
i
would
like
to
give
them
in
order.
two
issues
have
to
be
separated.
first
of
all,
whether
under
the
edwards
test
including
footnote
9,
defendant
initiated,
reinitiated
dialogue
or
conversations
with
the
police
and
then,
secondly,
whether
thereafter
the
defendant
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
knowingly,
voluntarily
and
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
so
our
point
is,
as
we
understand
the
meaning
of
the
edwards
decision,
is
not
that
the
first
utterance
of
the
defendant
has
to
be
a
total
johnson
versus
zerbst
waiver
in
itself,
which
only
a
law...
honors
graduate
of
a
law
school
could
think
of
to
utter,
but
simply
whether
it
constitutes
a
break
in
the
silence
upon
which
the
defendant
has
first
insisted
upon.
that's
what
happened
here.
this
is
a
classic
textbook
example,
in
our
judgment,
of
what
constitutes
the
initiation
of
dialogue
or
conversations
or
further
exchanges
with
the
police,
within
the
square
meaning
of
the
language
used
in
edwards,
within
the
meaning
of
the
words
that
this
court
established
in
its
wyrick
versus
fields
per
curiam
decision
today...
this
term,
and
actually,
justice
marshall,
a
point
which
you
made
in
your
own
dissenting
opinion
in
wyrick
versus
fields,
in
the
per
curiam
decision.
and
if
i
may,
i
think
that
the
words
that
you
wrote
demonstrate
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make,
when
you
wrote,
"when
a
suspect
commences
a
conversation
with
a
policeman,
he
has
reason
to
expect
that,
as
in
any
conversation,
there
will
be
a
give
and
take
extending
beyond
the
subject
matter
of
his
original
remarks.
"
"it
may
therefore
be
appropriate
to
conclude
that
the
suspect's
waiver
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
extends
to
the
entire
conversation.
"
now,
that's
our
contention
of
the
kind
of
case
that
we
have
today--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
but
it
is
within
the
context,
if
i
may
offer,
of
both
footnote
9
of
the
edwards
decision
and
of
the
language
of
that
decision.
and
again,
let
me
reemphasize
that
what
we
have
are
two
separate
inquiries.
whether
or
not
the
absolute,
apparently
absolute
requirement
of
silence
imposed
by
edwards
once
the
defendant
has
asked
for
his
right
to
counsel
and
secondly,
what
follows
upon
the
initiation
by
the
accused
of
further
conversations
with
the
police.
it
is
our
understanding
that--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i
understand
the
origins
of--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
i'm
not
contesting
our
compliance
with
the
miranda
doctrine,
and
in
fact
that's
precisely
what's
in--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that's
right,
and
the
edwards
decision,
which
construes
the
miranda
decision,
says
there
must
be
no
further
questioning
by
the
police
after
a
right
to
counsel
is
asserted,
and
that
was
scrupulously
honored
by
the
police
in
this
case.
not
only
was
it
honored
because
the
conversation
was
terminated
immediately
but
when
the
defendant
uttered
his
question,
which
reinitiated
the
conversation,
the
very
first
thing
that
the
police
officer
did
was
not
to
pounce
on
the
opportunity
but
rather
to
remind
the
defendant
that
he
had
previously
asserted
a
right
to
counsel
and
previously
asserted
his
right
to
silence,
followed
by
the
defendant's
statement,
"i
understand".
now
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
exemplary
police
procedure
and
yet,
it's
ironic
that
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
purporting
to
apply
the
decision
of
this
court
in
edwards
versus
arizona
said
that
that
was
somehow
improper
police
activity.
and
that
is
what
it
is
that
is
at
issue
today.
and
so
to
repeat
our
first
contention,
it
is
our
judgment,
our
belief
that
what
occurred
here
falls
squarely
within
the
meaning
of
this
court,
both
in
the
text
of
and
in
footnote
9
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
edwards
versus
arizona.
and
consider
the
differences
between
this
case
and
what
was
presented
to
you
in
the
edwards
decision
when
you
concluded,
as
a
court,
that...
unanimously...
that
it
was
inappropriate
for
the
police
to
resume
questioning
of
the
defendant.
unlike
edwards,
in
this
case
the
police
did
not
initiate
the
exchange.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
your
honor,
i...
it's
not
clear
to
me
what
the
court
precisely
meant
by
reopening
the
dialogue,
except
that
i--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
i
think
that's
the
best
meaning
that
can
be
put
on
that
language
because
i
think
any
other
meaning
you
put
on
it,
any
higher
threshold
of
attempting
to
ask
the
court
to
parse
the
defendant's
statements
in
order
to
decide
whether
it's
one
of
substance
or
of
procedure,
one
of
policy,
one
of
trying
to
find
out
where
the
facilities
are
and
so
forth,
would
get
this
court
into
a
hopeless
quagmire
of--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well.
you
see,
i
don't
think--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
did
or
not
but
let
me
suggest
this--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
not
the
initiation
of
dialogue.
that
is
not
the
resumption
of
conversation.
that
is
not
an
exchange.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
sure.
the
court
has
said
initiates
dialogue,
which
presumes
some
intelligent
exchange
between
human
beings
and
not
simply
a
declaratory
statement.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
think
it
certainly
calls
for
a
response
and
i
think
that
it
would
reopen
the
dialogue,
but
let
me
be
very
clear
about
what
we
are
asserting.
we're
not
asserting
that
simply
because
that
reopens
the
dialogue,
that
anything
that's
immediately
said
thereafter
is
fair
game.
we're
simply
saying
that,
having
reopened
the
dialogue,
you
then
have
crossed
the
threshold
which
this
court
set
as
the
basis
beyond
which
you
couldn't
tread
once
a
person
asserted
the
right--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--yes,
but
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
necessarily
an
easy
test
to
be
met,
justice
white.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
we're
simply
saying
that
we
believe
this
court
was
establishing
a
threshold
that
said
we
don't
want
the
police
simply
to
go
back
and
reask
and
reask
and
reask
a
person,
well,
do
you
really
waive
your
right
to
counsel,
did
you
really
mean
it.
so
apparently
the
thrust
of
the
edwards
test,
as
we
understand
it,
was
to
require
some
kind
of
initiation
of
conversation
that
would
not
only
show
that
the
defendant
was
not
standing
firmly
on
his
right
to
silence
but
that
he
wanted
further
information
of
some
kind.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
fine.
i
think
that
under
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
standard
of
waiver
that
that
would
not
be
found
to
be
a
voluntary,
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
of
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
it
probably
would
not
be
met
in
those
cases.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
it's
a
factual
case.
and
let
me
say
this,
that
even
if,
even
in
this
calculus,
what
the
defendant
says
in
the
course
of
the
initiation
of
his
exchange
may
well
bear
on
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
calculus
of
knowing,
intelligent
and
voluntary
waiver.
and
let
me
return
then
to
what,
in
fact,
the
defendant
said
in
this
case
because
it
was
not
may
i
have
a
drink
of
water,
or
when
is
my
lawyer
coming,
again.
it
was
a
question
which
was,
at
worst,
ambiguous.
in
our
judgment,
it
could
well
have
been
a
global
question,
in
the
largest
sense.
what's
going
to
happen
to
me,
as
a
consequence
of
my
involvement
in
the
criminal
justice
process.
that
may
be
why
the
question
was
immediately
followed
by
corporal
hays'
reassertion
and
reminder
to
the
defendant
that
he
might
be
about
to
say
something
very
damaging
and
that
he
ought
to
know
that
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney
and
a
right
to
remain
silent.
but
in
any
event,
it
clearly
was
not
a
trivial
question
that
was
asked
in
this
case,
and
the
police
officer,
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution,
wanted
to
make
it
clear
to
the
accused,
and
the
record
shows
he
did
so
because
he
wanted
to
be
fair
to
the
accused,
that
before
anything
else
transpired,
that
the
accused
was
reminded
of
his
rights.
so
quite
apart
from
whatever
might
be
low-level
exclusions
from
the
notion
of
initiating
dialogue,
this
example
hardly
falls
within
that
outer
periphery.
as
i
mentioned,
unlike
edwards,
the
police
didn't
initiate
this
exchange.
unlike
edwards,
the
accused
was
not
told
by
a
jailer
or
by
a
police
officer
that
he
had
to
talk.
unlike
edwards,
the
accused
did
not
decline
to
meet
with
the
police.
unlike
edwards,
upon
the
reinitiation
of
conversation,
the
police
promptly
showed
exemplary
respect
for
the
defendant's
rights.
unlike
edwards
and
other
cases,
there
is
not
a
whisper
of
police
trickery
or
deceit
in
this
case.
the
facts
show,
in
fact,
a
reasonable
response
by
a
police
officer
to
the
accused's
ambiguous
question
about
his
status
and
the
context
shows
an
abundance
of
caution
lest
the
defendant's
question
could
reasonably
be
understood
to
be
a
global
one.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
of
course,
the
policeman
had
already
offered
that
theory
of
the
case
in
the
tape-recorded
interview
at
the
police
station.
in
fact,
it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
tell
from
the
record
precisely
when
that
occurred
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
trial
judge
felt
that
the
agreement
to
take
the
polygraph
was
itself
not
the
result
of
interrogation
at
all.
now
that
decision,
of
course,
by
the
police
officer...
by
the
trial
judge
was
made
prior
to
whatever
information
of
his
judgment
might
have
been
rendered
by
rhode
island
versus
innis,
decided
subsequently
to
be
the
facts
in
this
case.
but
certainly,
the
ride
in
the
police
car
is
a...
and
the
wide
ranging
conversation
shows
itself
a
low
level
of
coercion,
if
any
at
all.
far
from
the
station
house,
mutt
and
jeff,
two
on
one,
incommunicado
type
questions.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
would
concede
that
at
some
point
there
was
interrogation,
certainly
by
the
time
the
individual
was
interviewed
following
the
polygraph
test.
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
that
the
low-level
wide
ranging
conversation
initiated
by
the
defendant
itself
was
inevitably
characterized
as
an
interrogation.
and
even
if
it
were,
no
incriminating
admissions
whatever
emerged
from
the
conversation
held
by
corporal
hays
and
the
accused,
all
the
way
to
the
tillamook
county
jail
and
in
fact,
nothing
incriminating
happened
until
after
the
conclusion
of
the
polygraph
test,
the
next
morning.
i
think
it's
worth
remembering
from--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--well,
we
have
two
different
occasions
on
which
that
might
have
occurred.
the
record
is
unclear
with
respect
to
the
first
because
we
have
only
the
recollection
of
the
officer,
which
is,
although
it
is
uncontroverted
by
the
accused,
as
to
what
occurred
in
the
rockaway
county
jail
and
enroute
to
the
tillamook
county
jail.
and
there
the
defendant
apparently
repeated
his
story
that
he
had
been
the
victim
of
an
assault
and
the
thrust
of
the
police
officer's
response
to
that
was
a
polygraph
would
help
to
clear
this
up.
and
the
defendant's
apparently
repeated
statements
that
i
want
to
clear
this
thing
up.
now,
that
certainly
is
a
far
cry
from
some
forms
of
interrogation
which
this
court
has
found
to
be
impermissible
and
i
suppose
it's
a
debatable
question
whether
under
the
rhode
island
versus
innis
standard,
it
amounts
to
interrogation
at
all.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
well,
i
believe
that
that's
correct.
it
was
certainly
not
of
a...
the
best
that
can
be
said
of
it
is
that
the
defendant
was
told
that
he
could
clear
up
his
story
by
taking
a
polygraph
test.
and
he
was
told
that
the
police
officer
had
a
different
theory
about
what
had
happened
than
the
theory
offered
by
the
defendant
himself.
the
second...
let
me
conclude
this
portion
of
my
argument
this
way.
if
the
language
in
edwards
about
reopening
dialogue
means
what
it
says,
it's
hard
to
understand
what
other
police
response
would
have
been
appropriate.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
nonresponsive
response.
i
think
that
the
response
that
he
gave
was
the
most
responsible
one
that
a
police
officer
of
this
nation
would
be
asked
to
give
and
that
is,
before
i
say
anything
to
you,
i
want
you
to
understand
you've
already
asked
for
counsel
and
that
you've
already
said...
that
i've
told
you
you
could
be
silent.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
he
reminded
him
of
it.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
sir.
i
believe
he
in
fact
reminded
him
in
a
much
more
extended
way,
which
is
actually
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
transcript
and
is
available
for
the
court's
perusal.
but
here
is
our
problem.
if
the
initiation
standard
of
edwards
means
something
more
than
the
initiation
of
dialogue,
however
trivial
or
however
serious,
then
the
police
officer's
only
response
may
well
be
one
of
silence
because
of
the
officer's
uncertainty
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
question
is
one
of
overall
significance
to
the
case
or
merely
a
trivial
one.
now
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
kafkaesque
imprisonment
of
a
person
in
the
web
of
his
or
her
own
privileges,
the
denial
of
meaningful
information
to
the
accused,
which
members
of
this
court
have
long
condemned
as
being
counter
to
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment.
the
second
point
of
my
argument
is
this,
that
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
standard
was
met
after
the
threshold
of
initiation
was
passed.
the
defendant
has
never
challenged
zerbst
below
and
its
objection
in
this
court
is,
we
believe,
misdirected.
applying
zerbst
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
clearly
a
knowing
waiver.
he
was
told.
he
was
reminded
of
his
rights...
he
was
told
of
his
rights,
read
his
rights
twice,
reminded
a
third
time
and
then,
before
he
took
the
polygraph
that
ultimately
was
the
only
device
that
secured
from
him
his
incriminating
admissions,
he
was
advised
in
oral
and
written
form,
comprehensively
and
exhaustively,
in
eight
checked-off
places
on
a
form
that
he
signed.
it
was
intelligent,
because
he
said
i
understand.
the
trial
court
finding
was
that
there
was
no
duress
or
coercion.
he
said
repeatedly
to
the
officer,
and
the
testimony
is
uncontroverted,
i
want
to
clear
this
thing
up.
unlike
edwards,
he
was
not
told
he
had
to
talk.
it
was
precisely
the
converse.
the
first
thing
that
he
was
told
in
response
to
the
assertion
of
his
rights
was
that
he
had...
he
was
reminded
of
his
rights.
consider
how
far
afield
this
is
from
the
miranda
cases
and
its
progeny
and
the
coercion
that
they
were
designed
to
prevent.
no
wearing
down
of
the
defendant.
no
incommunicado
holding,
no
trickery,
deceit,
no
evidence
of
insufficient
intelligence.
repeated
efforts
to
advise
of
rights,
a
wide
ranging
conversation
about
everything
from
police
officers
one
knows
to
who
lives
in
st.
helens,
oregon,
showing
if
anything
the
low
level
of
coercion,
if
any.
no
undermined
will.
repeated
attempts
by
the
police
to
inform
the
defendant
where
he
stood.
our
final
contention
is
that
if
the
initiation
requirement
of
edwards
must
be
construed
to
compel
the
result
in
the
oregon
court
of
appeals,
then
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
modified
per
se
test
of
edwards
should
be
reformulated
because
we
believe
that
that
modified
per
se
test
establishes
a
distinction
between
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
silence
and
right
to
counsel,
which
is
not
in
that
amendment
itself
and
was
suggested
by
miranda.
and
we
suggest
that
it
is
a
per
se
rule
which
ironically
enough
could
encourage
the
police
rather
than
discourage
them
from
answering
legitimate
questions
that
help
inform
the
defendant
about
his
own
status.
and
of
course,
it
may
completely
exclude
a
voluntary
change
of
mind
of
the
defendant
because
a
particular
initiation
threshold
doesn't
happen
to
be
present
in
a
given
case.
we
fail
to
understand,
and
that's
why
the
perplexity
we
advance
in
our
brief,
why,
though
both
rights
are
derived
from
the
fifth
amendment
and
why
it's
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
silence
that
is
being
protected,
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
silence
is
less
rigorous
than
a
waiver
of
the
derivative
fifth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
our
response
to
the
court
would
simply
be
that
the
request
for
counsel
does
not
invariably
mean
the
defendant
is
less
able
to
protect
his
own
rights
under
all
circumstances.
that
assumption
is
not,
we
believe,
invariably
warranted
by
the
endless
variety
of
facts
which
other
tests
can
better
measure.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
three
quick
remarks
on
the
factual
statements,
two
responses
to
the
public
defender,
and
then
i
will
conclude.
first,
in
reference
to
the
joint
appendix,
on
pages
17
and
18,
there
is
no
basis
for
concluding
that
corporal
hays
put
the
defendant
in
the
squad
car
and
then
immediately
accused
him
of
killing
the
victim.
the
only
evidence
is
that,
on
the
way
from
tillamook...
from
rockaway
to
tillamook,
there
was
a
wide
ranging
conversation
covering
this
and
many
related
matters.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
our
view
is
frankly
that
the
timing
of
the
statement
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
initiation.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
our
view
of
what
is
to
happen
to
me
now,
is
that
it
took
place
either
at
the
station
or
shortly
after
he
went
into
the
police
car.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
our
view
is
that
it
may
be
relevant
to
one
of
many
factors
in
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
formula.
it's
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
initiation.
probably
the
better
reading
is
that
it
probably
happened
in
the
police
station
but
the
court
of
appeals
of
oregon,
as
justice
rehnquist
has
noted,
indicates
that
there
is
some
confusion
on
that.
our
view
is,
in
any
event,
it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that's
correct
because
that's
the
question
of
initiation.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
at
six...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
don't
believe--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--on
the
joint
appendix.
at
pages
what?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
that
would
be
at
the
pretrial
hearing,
which
is
required
in
oregon
under
state
versus
brewton
and
which
is
the
jackson
versus
denno
hearing
of
the
state,
yes.
the
record
would
also
show
that
the
defendant
was
not
handcuffed
prior
to
arrest.
at
bottom,
let
me
summarize
our
response
to
defendant's
arguments
this
way.
there
are
two
fundamental
flaws
to
bradshaw's
argument.
first
of
all,
it
confuses
initiation
and
waiver.
it
telescopes
two
distinct
but
related
inquiries
into
one
which
is
directly
contrary,
in
our
view,
to
the
edwards
footnote
and
to
wyrick
versus
fields.
initiation
is
only
the
threshold
incurring
which
must
be
overcome
after
which
waiver
is
determined.
second,
if
initiation
means
something
more
than
the
simple
face
of
the
language,
which
the
edwards
decision
suggests,
then
this
court
inherits
a
legal
quagmire,
a
hopeless
series
of
legal
rubic's
cubes
of
dispute
as
to
the
meaning
of
thousands
of
potential
utterances
that
might
be
initiated
by
defendant
as
to
whether
they
do
or
they
don't
have
particular
legal
significance.
we
believe
in
fact
that
the
question
uttered
by
defendant
here
did
and
was
related
to
the
investigation.
but
the
point
is,
one
can't
always
tell.
it
ignores
the
give
and
take
of
conversation,
which
this
court
wisely
recognized
in
footnote
9
of
edwards.
the
mixed
conversation,
which
this
court
recognized
would
occur
once
defendant
and
the
police
officers
again
begin
their
conversation.
and
ironically
enough,
if
one
telescopes
both
inquiries,
initiation
and
waiver,
into
one,
as
the
public
defender
would
have
us
to
do,
it
leaves
nothing
for
the
waiver
issue
to
be
decided
under
the
separate
johnson
versus
zerbst
test,
which
this
court
has
set
forward.
in
that
sense--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
