mr.
gary
d.
babcock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
four
criteria
or
things
that
can
be
raised
that
will
show
that
bradshaw
did
not
initiate
the
dialogue
with
the
police
officers
in
this
case.
and
i
would
like
just
to
briefly
mention
these
four
criteria
as
a
useful
test
and
then
get
into
them
a
little
more
elaborately
as
it
relates
to
the
facts
of
bradshaw.
first
of
all
as
it
relates
to
initiation
or
reopening
the
dialogue,
to
initiate,
the
accused
must
say
something
that
is
relevant
to
the
criminal
investigation
to
reopen
the
dialogue.
second,
and
probably
most
important
in
this
case,
there
must
be
some
passage
of
time
between
the
request
for
the
lawyer
and
any
language
that's
claimed
by
the
prosecution
to
be
initiatory.
now,
another
factor
and
the
third
factor
to
be
considered
is
that
if
there
is
any
physical
separation
between
the
accused
and
the
police
officers
in
space
which
goes
along
with
the
time
aspect.
and
fourth,
and
more
important
i
think
probably
is
the
initiation
words
using
implication...
must
be
an
implication
of
giving
up
the
previous
request
for
the
lawyer.
the
defendant
must
move
from
mosley
representing
himself
or
edwards
asking
for
help
over
to
the
mosley
side
of
it,
where
he
is
going
to
represent
himself,
he
is
going
to
keep
the
lines
of
communication
open.
this
court
has
recognized
that
conversations
between
police
officers,
like
in
innis,
are
going
to
happen,
which
are
commonplace,
not
necessarily
relevant
to
the
criminal
investigation.
likewise,
i
think
in
edwards,
this
court
acknowledges
the
fact
that
there
are
going
to
be
conversations
between
the
defendant
and
the
police
officer
that
aren't
necessarily
tied
to
the
criminal
investigation.
examples
have
been
asked
for
and
given
here
today.
now
again
the
idea
here...
we're
not
just
dealing
with
a
mosley
situation,
we're
dealing
with
a
request
for
a
lawyer
which
carries
a
much
heavier
burden
of
proof
because
it
incorporates
also
the
idea
of
the
self-incrimination
aspect.
he's
asking
for
assistance,
for
help.
this
standard...
and
third,
the
idea
of
initiation
is
not
just
a
voluntary
thing,
it
also
involves
the
more
complex
aspect
of
the
intelligent,
understanding;
knowing
waiver
aspect
that
this
court
discussed
about
the
arizona
supreme
court's
interpretation
using
a
consent
fourth
amendment
claim.
it
has
to
involve
the
passage
of
time
and
some
meditation,
some
thought
process,
to
give
up
the
seating
of
interrogation,
which
bradshaw
asked
for
when
he
asked
for
a
lawyer.
now
moving
first
of
all
to
the
words
relevant
to
the
criminal
investigation,
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now,
i
don't
read
the
record
the
same
way
as
the
attorney
general
reads
it.
i
read
it
this
way.
officer
hays,
the
police
officer,
he
arrests
bradshaw
on
the
furnishing
charge
and
at
that
time,
right
within
seconds
he
accuses
him
of
killing
reynolds,
being
responsible
for
killing
reynolds.
then
he
advises
him
of
his
miranda
rights.
and
then
bradshaw
says,
i
want
a
lawyer,
or
words
to
that
effect.
and
then
within
seconds,
although
the
record
doesn't
reflect
this
but
it
has
got
to
be
seconds,
the
only
act
or
the
only
thing
that
happened
between
his
request
for
a
lawyer
and
this
comment
here
about
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now,
is
handcuffing.
and
that
was
at
the
police
station
and
that
was
within
seconds,
i
would
say
to
give
the
state
the
benefit
of
the
doubt,
120
seconds,
two
minutes.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
your
honor,
i've
taken
this
portion
of
the
transcript,
and
i'll
read
it
very
shortly...
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
there--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
you've
got
the
tape
recording
on
the
request
for
the
lawyer.
officer
hays
cuts
off...
he
cuts
off
the
interrogation
and
he
said,
now
you've
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
then
bradshaw
says,
yes,
i
agree
with
you,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
tape.
and
you
have
to
hook
into
the
officer's
testimony
which
i'm
only
taking...
they
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case.
i'm
talking
from
page
23
of
the
transcript,
there
was
several
comments
made
about
where
he
was
going
to
go
and
what
he
would
be
charged
with
and
i
put
him
in
the
police
car.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
no,
your
honor,
i
think
what
had
happened
with
the
court
of
appeals
was
they
construed
edwards
as
a
per
se
rule
and
really
didn't
get
into
weighing
exactly
what
happened.
when
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
the
next
thing
that
happened
on
the
record,
like
i
say,
at
least...
we
don't
know...
i
say
in
the
police
station,
from
this
transcript
reading,
was
his
remark,
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now.
it
was
a
natural
response
to
being
handcuffed.
and
i
think
the
supreme...
or
the
court
of
appeals,
although
they
didn't
get
into
saying,
you
know,
what
they
thought
the
time
was,
i'm
just
taking
officer
hays'
testimony
and
he
did
submit
that
the
police
car
to
take
him
down
to
the
jail--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
i'm
just
using...
yes,
i'm
just
using...
again,
i'm
just
using
officer
hays'
testimony
about
when
the
remark
occurred.
i
thought
everybody
had
agreed
that
this
remark
occurred
in
the
police
station.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
don't
think
they
addressed
it,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
the
assumption
was,
since
they
applied...
i
mean
they
applied
this
rule,
the
assumption
was,
i
thought,
that
although
they
didn't
give
a
reason
for
it,
was
that
when
he
made
this
remark
it
was
not
initiation.
i'm
using
the
time
factor
here
as
a
very
important
fact
in
the
sense
of
the
understanding,
knowing
waiver
aspect.
it
doesn't
really
intelligently...
it
can't
really
intelligently
be
put
into
the
record
unless
it
really
occurs
fairly
close
to
the
request
for
the
lawyer.
now
another
thing
that's
not
mentioned
here,
and
that's
what
i
just
read,
is
that
in
the
police
station
there's
no
ambiguity
with
his
statement
about
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now.
and
we
can
sit
around
and
argue
about
that
but
the
record
shows
that
officer
hays
answered
the
question.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
think
that's
a...
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
classic
case
of
initiation
by
the
accused.
he
initiates--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--innis.
there
was--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
there
was
whether
or
not
there
was
interrogation.
i
don't
think
that
was
an
opening
of
the
dialogue.
i
think
that
was
a
recognition
that
police
officers
are
going
to
talk
about--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--it
was
short
in
time,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i'll
show
you
where
the
shotgun
is.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
well,
your
honor,
assuming
that--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--i
think,
of
course,
if
that's
a
reasonable
reading
of
that,
then,
of
course,
it
would
have
to
have
been
concluded
that
that
was
interrogation,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
it
was
not
interrogation.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
i
conclude
then
that
the
initiation
in
that
case
was
innis.
otherwise
it
was--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--yes.
it
was
sparked,
maybe,
by
those
police
officers.
i
thought
of
innis
only
in
a
sense
that
that
is
a
classic
case
of
initiation
involving
not
a
defense
but
actually,
inculpatory
statements.
i
think
initiation
shouldn't
necessarily
be
limited
to
just
some
kind
of
defense,
i've
got
alibi
witnesses,
but
also,
lookit,
i've
decided
to
let
you
know
where
the
gun
is,
or
whatever
the
case
may
be.
again,
there
is
no
problem
with
calling
this
ambiguous,
as
the
attorney
general
suggests,
because
the
record
shows,
again
the
testimony
of
officer
hays
shows
that
he
answered
his
question.
that
was
after
he
readvised
him,
when
he
made
this
remark,
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now.
a
clear
case,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
the
true,
the
true
example
of
initiation
can
be
found
again
in
officer
hays'
testimony.
right
after
he
readvises
bradshaw
of
his
rights,
after
bradshaw
has
said,
hey,
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now.
then
officer
hays
answers
the
question,
puts
him
right
into
the
police
car
in
the
front
seat
to
talk.
and
if
you'll
look
at
the
record,
the
first
two
things
that
officer
hays
testifies
to
is
i
put
him
in
the
front
seat
to
talk
and
i
accused
him
of
killing
reynolds,
again.
it's
a
classic
case
of
initiation,
very
similar
to
what
happened
in
mosley,
but
they
visited
him
the
next
day.
but
again,
that's
the
real
case
of
initiation
and
not
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now,
right
after
being
handcuffed.
and
that's
in
the
transcript,
and
that's
the
record.
the
one
real
single
factor,
and
i
think
in
this
case,
that
really
stands
out
as
the
most
important
criteria,
if
i
can
get
to
that,
is
the
fact
that
from
the
time
of
the
request
for
the
lawyer
and
from
the
time
that
he
makes
this
remark,
again
we're
talking
about
just
seconds,
even
in
mosley
talking
about
the
self-incrimination
aspect,
there
was
at
least
over
two
hours,
a
different
police
officer
and
a
different
crime,
when
this
standard
of
an
intelligent
waiver
could
be
applied
to
this
case.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand,
if
we're
going
to
use
this
initiation
concept
as
a
rule
that
can
cut
off
and
cease
questioning,
like
happened
with
mosley,
and
apply
this
qualified
rule
and
not
as
strict
rule
where
we
have
to
wait
to
have
a
lawyer
come
in
and
talk
to
him,
where
we
have
to
have
that
buffer,
and
certainly
under
these,
johnson
versus
zerbst
and
all
these
cases,
we
can't
have
bradshaw
making
an
intelligent
decision
to
initiate
this
thing
and
to
reopen
the
dialogue
in
60
seconds.
if
we
take
the
attorney...
and
this
is
also,
i
might
add,
if
you
take
this
event
of
initiation
and
move
it
closer
in
time
to
the
request
for
the
lawyer
and
eventually
where
they
almost
stand
on
top
of
each
other,
we've
almost
got
this
conjunctive
of
bradshaw
saying,
i
want
a
lawyer,
and
what's
going
to
happen
to
me,
now.
as
you
move
these
two
events
closer
and
closer,
i
think
to
have
any
real
meaning
to
initiation,
you
have
to
come
closer
and
closer
to
an
express
form
of
recision
of
that
request.
and
that's
consistent
with
butler,
which
of
course
was
a
nonrequest
for
attorney
cases.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
the
court...
your
honor,
i
don't
know...
again
i'm
reading
off
of
what
officer
hays
says
before
he
puts
him
in
the
police
car.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
record,
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt,
that
he
was
handcuffed
in
between
his
request
for
a
lawyer
and
his
statement,
his
remark.
because
during
the
trip
to
the--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
no,
i'm
sorry.
he
was
arrested
for
furnishing,
which
was
a...
it's
a
violation
in
oregon
that
carries
a
$200
fine
and
i
think,
as
a
matter
of
common
practice,
police
officers
when
they
arrest,
they're
going
to
put
handcuffs
on
him.
i
use
handcuffs
only
in
the
illustrative
sense
of
this
is
probably
why
he
said,
you
know,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
now.
officer
hays
had
about
ten
or
twelve
opportunities
before
this
to
arrest
him
for
the
same
thing.
all
the
way
back
in
the
preceding
night,
on
the
13th.
bradshaw
told
the
police
officers
he'd
given
the
deceased
alcohol.
so
you
see,
officer
hays
had
a
whole
day
and
a
half
to
arrest
him
but
he
didn't
have
probable
cause
on
the
automobile
accident,
on
the
manslaughter
and
that
is
what
he
was
working
for.
and
he
can't
be
criticized
for
that.
innis
recognizes
his
right
to...
in
fact,
we
recognize
the
right
for
him
to
even
interrogate
him
if
he
doesn't
exercise
his
rights.
and
it
is
certainly
a
right
he
exercised.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
your
honor,
as
i
understand
this,
he
was
arrested,
the
officer
said
to
him
i'm
going
to
arrest
you
for
furnishing.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
then
he
said,
you
can't
leave.
now,
he
said,
i'm
going
to
give
you
my
theory
on
this,
bradshaw.
i
think
you
were...
let
me
give
you
the
theory
on
this.
and
then
he
tells
him
that
he's
going
to
take...
and
he
thought
that
he
was
driving
the
vehicle
and
that
he
had
been
injured
and
reynolds
had
died.
then
he
readvises...
or,
i'm
sorry,
he
advises
bradshaw
of
his
miranda
rights.
and
then,
after
he
advises
him
of
his
miranda
rights,
then
bradshaw
exercises
them.
and
then
right
after
that,
the
officer
handcuffs
him.
and
then
right
after
that,
he's
still
in
the
police
station,
he
says
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now.
and
then
bradshaw--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--the
handcuffing.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes,
and
your
honor,
it's...
the
point
i
make
on
that,
if
there
is
a
point
to
be
made,
that
there
is--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--well,
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry
i'm
not...
certainly
i'm
not
trying
to
misstate
the
record.
i'm
going
solely
on
the
basis
of,
and
i
didn't
know...
i'm
going
solely
on
the
basis
of
what
the
officer
testified
to.
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
yes.
well,
my
argument
from
this
particular
record
is
that
the
state
has
the
burden
of
proof.
and
it
is
a
heavy
burden,
as
it
relates...
we
do
know
on
the
face
of
the
record
that
bradshaw
asked
for
a
lawyer.
that's
on
the
face
of
the
record.
and
initiation,
as
i
understand
edwards,
must
be
shown
by
the
accused...
i
mean,
sorry,
by
the
state
that
bradshaw
had
initiated
this
conversation.
the
most
that
shows
up
on
the
face
of
this
record
is
the
remark
of
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now.
and
i
read
that
in
a
context
of
the
trip
to...
from
the
police
station
to
the
jail
encompassed
the
reaccusation
and
then
the
working
out
of
the
agreement
to
take
the
polygraph
examination.
to
view
this...
to
view
this
in
a
context,
if
the
event
of
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now
occurred
after
officer
hays'
second
accusation,
accusing
him
of
killing...
of
killing
reynolds,
then
still
on
the
face
of
this
record,
what
do
we
have
by
way
of
initiation?
the
most
that
bradshaw
ever
said
in
this
case
was
i
understand,
when
officer
hays
readvised
him.
we
don't
have
anything
from
the
defendant's
mouth
initiating
this
dialogue
or
reopening
this
dialogue.
it
was
officer
hays,
as
you
view
the
record
in
any
particular
way
you
want
to
look
at
the
record,
who
kept
the
dialogue
going.
he
asked
him...
officer
hays
asked
him
to
take
the
polygraph
test.
he
reaccused
him.
he
readvised.
we
don't
have
anything
out
of
the
defendant's
mouth
except
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now,
and
i
understand.
there's
nothing
on
this
record.
i
emphasize
the
time
aspect
because,
again,
it's
difficult
to
understand...
i
don't
want
to
be
dogmatic
about
that.
it
may
be
read
differently
by
the
court
of
appeals.
if
you
look
at
this,
though,
at
the
existing
state
of
the
record,
you're
looking
at
a
situation,
if
you
accept
the
state's
argument,
you're
looking
at
a
situation
where
bradshaw
asked
for
a
lawyer,
the
interrogation
ceases,
the
defendant
says
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now.
and
for
the
state
to
be
successful
on
showing
some
form
of
waiver
here,
that's
got
to
be
equivalent
to
saying
no,
officer
hays,
forget
the
lawyer.
and
there's
no
way,
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
to
conclude
that
he
says
i
want
a
lawyer
and
then,
i
don't
want
a
lawyer.
two
other
aspects
of
the
case
that
may
bear
upon
how
you
interpret
this
particular
statement
is,
there
was
no
physical
separation
for
sure
between
officer
hays
and
the
defendant
for
a
very
short
period
of
time.
i
think
we
are
looking
at,
at
the
outside,
the
record's
not
clear,
of
maybe
fifteen
minutes
here.
so
really--
mr.
gary
d.
babcock
--no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
way
to
know
exactly
what
happened
enroute,
though
bradshaw
finally
did
agree
to
take
the
polygraph
examination.
with
the
idea,
again,
of
initiation,
the
fourth
thing
i
would
mention
is
that
there
would
be
some
words,
some
way
to
imply
a
waiver
of
this
request
in
looking
at
the
words
of
initiation,
and
most
certainly,
what's
going
to
happen
to
me
now
doesn't
really
imply
any
kind
of
a
waiver,
i
think,
any
way
you
want
to
read
it,
at
least
in
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
environment.
and
for
this
reason,
i
think
that
as
far
as
all
four
of
these
criteria
that
i'm
talking
about,
the
concept
of
initiation
in
creating
that
buffer
and
that
protection
for
the
accused
is
pretty
much
going
to
mean
not
very
much
any
time
you
say
anything
that's
going
to
allow
the
police
officers
to
reaccuse
you
and
keep
the
dialogue
going.
thank
you.
