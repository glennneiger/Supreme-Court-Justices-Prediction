we
will
hear
argument
next
in
oregon
versus
bradshaw.
mr.
frohnmayer,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
characterize
the
statements
made
by
the
police
officers
in
the
hearing
of
innis,
in
innis
against
rhode
island,
were
suggestive
and
prompting
type
of
statements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
they
suggestive,
were
they
prompted...
were
they
prompting
statements,
to
prompt
an
accused,
an
arrested
person
to
open
up?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
didn't
the
court
indicate
in
rhode
island
against
innis
that
the
statements
made
by
the
police
were
indeed
suggestive
and
of
a
prompting
nature?
and
yet
we
approved
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
attorney
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
babcock?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
innis
against
rhode
island,
how
did
the
challenge
to
the
events
become
initiated?
whose
voice
began
the
discussion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
accused?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
the
police
officer
who
said
to
his
colleague,
in
the
hearing
of
innis,
who
was
two
or
three
feet
away,
it
will
be
a
terrible
thing
if
the
children
in
the
retarded
school
get
hold
of
this
gun
and
the
ammunition,
or
words
to
that
effect.
did
the
police
not
open
the
dialogue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
not
the
crucial
event
come
immediately
after
the
policeman
said
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
innis
then
said--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--i'll
tell
you
where
it
is.
go
up
two
miles
and
one
mile
to
the
left,
or
something
like
that.
did
not
the
police
initiate
that
dialogue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that...
wouldn't
that
a
reasonable
reading
of
innis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
except
the
courts
concluded
that
it
was
not
interrogation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
his
response
was
what
opened
it.
i
see.
in
your
view.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
there
is
anything
unusual
about
handcuffing
where
there
is
a
murder,
a
homicide
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wasn't
sure,
because
you
mentioned
it
several
times.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that's...
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
