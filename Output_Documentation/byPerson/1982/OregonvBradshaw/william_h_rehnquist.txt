justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
defendant
says
i'd
like
a
glass
of
water
and
the
police
officer
says,
fine,
i'll
go
get
you
one,
did
you
really
mean
to
waive
your
rights
or
did
you
really
want
an
attorney?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
you
don't
know
what
he's
said
yet.
all
you
know
is
that
the
police
officer
has
said
two
things,
that
i'll
get
you
a
glass
of
water
and
are
you
sure
you
want
a
lawyer.
now
if
the
defendant
responds
at
that
point,
on
second
thought
i
don't
want
a
lawyer,
then
you
say
johnson
against
zerbst
is
not
met?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
a
factual
inquiry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
some
dispute
in
the
record,
mr.
babcock,
as
to
when
the
statement
was
made,
whether
it
was
made
before
being
shipped
from
rockaway
to
tillamook,
or
whether
it
was
made
during
the
car
journey?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
said
there
was,
or
am
i
thinking
of
the
wrong--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
here's
what
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
said,
at
least
what
it
seems
to
me
it's
saying
and
that
is
on
page
eleven
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
sometime
thereafter,
either
prior
to
or
during
the
course
of
his
transfer
to
the
tillamook
county
jail,
defendant
inquired
of
the
officer...
defendant
recalls
this
was
while
he
was
enroute
by
automobile
from
the
police
station
to
the
county
jail.
the
state
interprets
the
records
as
indicating
the
query
was
made
while
he
was
still
in
the
police
station.
and
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
seems
to
say
there
is
a
dispute
and
really
doesn't
try
to
resolve
it,
as
i
read
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
trial
court
make
a
finding
on
this
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
simply
really
arguing
what's
basically
a
factual
question
to
us.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
they
said
there
was
a
dispute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
therefore,
it
is
not
a
reasonable
reading.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
basis
for
saying
it's
virtually
simultaneous
is
the
fact
that
it
happened
right
after
he
was
handcuffed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
then
if
the
second
hypothesis
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
that
it
occurred
in
the
car
from
tillamook
to...
rockaway
to
tillamook
is
right,
he
certainly
wouldn't...
he
would
have
been
handcuffed
before
he
got
in
the
car,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
either
you're
wrong
or
the
second
hypothesis
of
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
is
wrong.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
any
of
the
oregon
courts
have
engaged
in
fact-finding,
were
bound
to
believe
the
officer's
testimony
perhaps
against
the
best
interests
of
the
state
as
opposed
to
the
defendant's
testimony
against
his
best
interests.
and
most
assuredly
we
can't
resolve
a
factual
dispute
like
that.
you
are
simply
saying
that...
i
mean,
we
are
not
a
jury.
you
can
argue
the
fact
that
the
officer
said
this
and
therefore,
you
ought
to
find
that.
but
that's
really
not
what
we're
here
for.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
as
to
how
long
it
takes
to
go
from
rockaway
to
tillamook?
