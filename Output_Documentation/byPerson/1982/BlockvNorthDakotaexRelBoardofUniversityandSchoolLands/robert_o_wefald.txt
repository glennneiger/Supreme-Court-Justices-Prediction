mr.
robert
o.
wefald
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
threshold
issue
here
is
navigability.
i
have
to
point
out
a
couple
of
things
that
should
be
noted
right
here.
we
have
a
couple
of
things
that
the
petitioners
have
not
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
we
have
evidence
of
navigability.
second
of
all,
we
have
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
finding
that
the
little
missour
river
is
navigable.
navigability
is
a
threshold
question.
without
navigability,
the
state
of
north
dakota
is
out
of
court,
period.
it
is
interesting
also
to
note
that,
of
course,
when
we
review
the
evidence,
brother
claiborne
failed
to
note,
that
the
corps
of
engineers
in
1975,
which
is
exhibit
a
in
the
trial
transcript,
had
a
study
that
concluded
that
the
little
missour
river
was
navigable.
there
is
plenty
of
evidence.
the
characterization
of
baptiste
who
came
down
the
river
in
1804,
who
did
in
fact
make
it
in
a
canoe.
teddy
roosevelt
in
march
of
1886
pursued
bandits
down
the
little
missour
river
in
a
boat
that
he
had
constructed
for
that
particular
purpose.
he
caught
them,
and
took
them
to
jail.
we
want
from
the
government
a
fair
deal,
a
square
deal,
as
teddy
roosevelt
would
have
given
us.
and,
that
is
what
we
have
gotten
in
the
two
lower
courts
in
this
particular
case.
the
little
missouri
river
is
navigable.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
only
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
threshold
question--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--the
threshold
question
is
navigability
and
sovereignty.
the
two
are
tied
together.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
because--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--navigability?
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
they
assert
that
the
river
is
not
navigable,
but
they
have
offered
no
evidence
whatsoever
with
respect
to
non-navigability.
their
reliance,
as
brother
claiborne
said
at
the
district
court
level,
was
simply
on
the
question
of
notice
and
their
statute
of
limitations--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--that
is
correct.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
navigability
and
sovereignty,
it
ties
in
this
way.
the
district
court
found
that
under
the
nullum
tempus
rule
that
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
quiet
title
act,
sub
f,
does
not
run
against
the
sovereign,
in
that
north
dakota
as
the
other
states
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
a
sovereign
with
respect
to
the
retained
sovereign
title
of
the
beds
under
navigable
waters.
and,
hence,
we
have
to
take
the
two
questions
together.
just
like
judge
vansickle
did
at
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
indeed.
in
this
particular
case,
the
question
is
state
sovereignty.
there
may
well
be
areas
in
which
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
to
limit
or
withhold
a
suit
brought
by
a
state.
in
this
particular
case,
because
of
the
sovereign
nature
of
the
claim
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
to
its
waters
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
the
court
found
that
the
statute
of
limitations
did
not
run
against
the
sovereign.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
i
would
hope
so.
that
takes
us
then
to
the
question
of
sovereignty.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
we
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
argument
with
respect
to
that
because
our
claim
would
not
be
under
sovereignty...
retained
sovereignty--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--that
is
correct.
it
may
very
well
bar
others,
but
we
do
not
have
those
particular
issues
here.
we
have
here
today
the
question
of
retained
sovereignty,
and
that
is
what
we
have.
so,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
sovereignty--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--did
the
federal
government
give
up
sovereignty?
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that
is
correct.
it
did.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
the
government
argues
that
it
could--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--it
did,
in
fact,
in
this
case
put
a
condition
on
it.
that
condition,
however--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--the
answer
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
is
that
that
condition
does
not
apply
against
a
sovereign
state
claiming
a
sovereign
interest.
we
agree
with
that
contention,
that
conclusion,
because
under
the
retained
sovereignty,
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
we
are
the
sovereign
with
respect
to
the
bed
of
the
little
missouri
river,
not
the
federal
government--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--yes.
their
argument
is
that--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--with
respect
to
the
bed
of
the
little
missour
river--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--indeed,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that
is
correct.
no
question
about
that.
so
with
respect
to
the
question
of
sovereignty,
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
which
was
that
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
run
against
the
sovereign,
i.e.
the
state
of
north
dakota
acting
in
a
sovereign
capacity.
we
believe
that
that
is
the
correct
interpretation
and
that
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
district
court
ought
to
now
be
affirmed
by
this
particular
court.
with
respect
to
the
one
comment
made
by
brother
claiborne
about
the
states
that
have
filed
the
amicus
brief
and
joined
in
this
issue,
the
problem
that
states
have
is
the
same
problem
any
sovereign
has.
but,
we
cannot
allow
assets
of
a
sovereign
to
be
dissipated
or
to
be
lost
through
an
action
of
its
particular
official.
that
is
exactly
what
the
federal
government
is
claiming.
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
of
north
dakota
cannot
afford
to
have
its
assets
transferred
from
its
public
trust
lands
to
the
federal
government...
exactly
the
converse
to
what
the
federal
government
arguing.
the
petitioners
say
if
this
action
is
affirmed,
the
federal
treasury...
the
federal
government
will
have
lost
an
asset.
and,
i
say
that
is
nonsense
because
that
property
has
belonged
to
the
state
of
north
dakota
since
statehood.
as
far
as
the
question
of
multiple
leases
go,
when
we
should
have
known
about
this,
there
was
not
really
a
problem
because
we
were
leasing
at
the
same
time
the
federal
government
was
leasing.
companies
were
paying
us
the
same
time
they
were
paying
the
federal
government,
taking
dual
leases.
and,
that
was
common.
at
least,
it
was
common
up
to
the
point
when
leases
were
relatively
cheap.
but,
as
it
became
more
expensive--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--that
is
correct.
plus,
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
paying
royalties,
they
did
not
want
to
pay
dual
royalties.
we
think
that
the
record
is
clear
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
north
dakota
does,
in
fact,
own
the
bed
of
the
little
missouri
river,
that
we
own
it
as
a
sovereign
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
and,
that
by
virtue
of
our
sovereignty,
the
statute
of
limitations
found
in
sub
(f)
does
not
apply
to
us.
the
united
states
petitioners
admit
on
page
15
of
their
brief,
they
say
"it
is
common
ground
that
if
the
river
was
navigable
at
statehood,
the
bed
belongs
to
north
dakota.
"
that
is
our
position.
they
also--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--we
would
own
it
nevertheless.
the
question
is
how
do
you
prove
up
the
ownership.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
i
think
that
we
would
have
a
cause
of
action
in
federal
court
without
the
quiet
title
action.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
i
think
under
a
line
of
cases,
the
lee,
larson,
malone
cases,
we
would
have
an
action
against
federal
officers.
take
the
larson
case
in
particular,
a
case
in
1949.
that
one
would
indicate
that
they
would
impose
some
limitations
on
the
lee
holding,
but
it
did
say
that
insofar
as
it
goes
to
a
question...
a
constitutional
question,
we
have
a
right
to
access.
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--we
would
be
happy
for
affirmance
on
any
ground.
on
that
particular
ground--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--i
do
not
believe
that
issue
is
squarely
before
us.
the
petitioners
have
said
we
are
talking
about
the
12-year
statute
of
limitations.
we
are
satisfied
with
the
holding
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirming
the
district
court
that
the
statute
does
not
apply.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
well,
then
i
would
ask
you
to
take
a
look
at
the
other
grounds
we
have
asserted--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--certainly
because
all
of
these
issues
have
been
briefed
by
all
the
parties.
the
entire
record
is
before
the
court.
brother
claiborne,
notwithstanding
his
argument
about
the
12-year
statute
of
limitations,
persists
in
maintaining
the
question
of
navigability
is
still
open.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
right.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
no,
i
do
not
believe
there
is
simply
because
we
in
this
claim
are
a
sovereign,
and
the
statute
of
limitations
does
not
run
against
the
sovereign.
that
is
how--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--insofar
as
we
are
claiming
sovereign
lands,
that
is
correct,
with
respect
to
the
ownership
of
the
sovereign
lands.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that
is
correct,
because
in
this
particular
case
there
can
only
be
one
sovereign
over
the
bed
of
the
river.
it
is
either
the
state
of
north
dakota
or
it
is
the
united
states
insofar
as
it
is
a
riparian
landowner
to
those
places
of
the
riverbed
to
which
it
is
adjacent.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
no,
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
riparian
nature.
our
sovereignty
comes
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
river
is
navigable--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
government
had...
the
federal
government
has
overriding
powers
in
many
areas.
there
is,
however,
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
the
clear
constitutional
argument
that
sovereignty
with
respect
to
these
navigable
river
beds
is
retained
by
the
states.
and
that
is
for
the
states
alone,
and
not
for
the
federal
government.
so,
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
we,
in
fact,
own
the
bed
of
the
little
missouri
river.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
no,
sir,
not
that
i
am
aware.
i
am
aware
of
no
such
thing.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
with
respect
to
private
owners,
we
have
no
particular
problem.
at
least
that
there
is
no--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
there
are
private
riparian
owners.
with
respect
to
private
riparian
owners,
any
claim
that
they
can
assert
is
limited
by
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
in
our
ownership
of
the
riverbed.
so,
they
cannot
hold
it.
and
we
would
clearly
win
as
to
them
in
any
litigation.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
none
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
in
united
states
v.
texas,
that
1892
case,
the
court
clearly
held
that
sovereign
immunity
applies
by
a
suit
brought
against
an
individual.
but,
they
talk
about
suits
between
sovereigns
and
the
need
for
an
opportunity
for
reform.
so,
united
states
v.
texas
clearly
gives
to
the
federal
courts
an
opportunity
to
hear
constitutional
questions
involving
sovereign
governments,
in
this
case
a
claim
of
sovereign
dispute
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
of
north
dakota.
as
to
the
question
of
the
private
owners,
there
may
be
some
lawsuits
going
on.
if
we
have
any
difficulty
with
them,
their
lawsuits
would
be
handled
in
our
state
courts.
now,
there
is,
in
addition
to
the
question
of
the
statute
of
limitations
run
against
the
sovereign,
in
addition
to
the
constitutional
argument
that
we
have
suggested.
there
is
another
line
of
cases,
and
i
believe
several
of
the
cases
have
been
cited
by
the
government...
by
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
on
pages
30
to
34,
davis
v.
passman,
carlson
case.
now,
these
are
cases
that
follow
up
on,
i
think,
the
lee,
larson
and
malone
line
of
cases
with
respect
to
the
ability
of
a
claimant
to
bring
a
claim
against
an
official,
notwithstanding
whether
or
not
there
is
a
particular
statutory
remedy
available.
so,
we
think
there
is
an
adequate
basis
to
get
to
court
with
respect
to
the
claim
we
are
making.
i
guess
i
would
have
to
emphasize
again
that
if
we
were
to
follow
the
logic
of
the
petitioners'
position
here
today,
north
dakota
would
have
been
out
of
court,
would
have
lost
all
of
its
right
to
sue
under
the
quiet
title
act,
five
years
before
the
law
was
enacted.
in
their
brief,
the
united
states
admits
that
this
is
harsh
and
one-sided
on
pages
20
and
27.
nevertheless,
they
assert
that
this
is
a
valid
interpretation.
and,
we
say
that
is
wrong
because
with
respect
to
our
constitutional
scheme
of
government
and
the
retained
sovereignty
of
states,
in
particular
the
additional
states
that
came
into
the
union
after
the
original
thirteen
under
equal
footing
doctrine,
we
have
to
have
the
ability
to
protect
our
sovereign
rights
and
to
have
a
form--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--i
would
assume
that
that
would
be
their
position,
but
their
position
is,
in
fact,
that
there
was
no
access
whatsoever
prior
to
1972.
i
would
assume
that
would
be
their
position
on
it.
and,
of
course,
that
is
a
position
which
we
would
dispute.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
we
did,
indeed.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
and
to
the
district
court
as
well.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
did
not
rule
on
it--
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
o.
wefald
that
is
correct.
that
is
simply
argued
as
an
alternate
ground.
we
do
not
think
that
this
court
has
to
go
that
far
either
because
we
think
the
ruling
of
both
the
district
court
and
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
correct
and
ought
to
be
affirmed.
one
other
point
that
i
would
just
briefly
like
to
address
is
the
so-called
floodgates
argument.
brother
claiborne
mentions
that
somehow
by
affirming
this
decision
we
are
going
to
open
the
doors
to
a
whole
host
of
litigation.
i
simply
do
not
think
that
is
true.
perhaps,
just
exactly
the
converse
may
be
true,
that
if
we
do
not
affirm
this
decision
there
will
be
a
whole
host
of
states
scrambling
right
now
trying
to
identify
any
conceivable
claim
that
could
be
made
by
petitioners
or
like
people
in
the
federal
government,
and
there
would
be
a
whole
host
of
lawsuits
filed
under
the
quiet
title
act
trying
to
beat
the
co-called
12-year
statute
of
limitations
that
may
very
well
run
as
to
many
of
these
people
in
1984.
i
think
that
a
denial,
a
reversal
of
this
claim,
in
fact,
would
increase
litigation.
there
is
no
sense
promoting
litigation
when,
in
fact,
over
the
years
federal
officials
and
state
officials
are
getting
along
reasonably
well
with
respect
to
a
particular
piece
of
ground.
let's
not
generate
cases.
let's
handle
the
cases
as
they
come
up.
and,
i
think
the
floodgates
argument
simply
is
erroneous
in
this
respect.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
like
to
note
that
the
state
of
north
dakata
and
the
29
amicus
states
respectfully
requests
that
this
court
recognize
a
state's
right
to
protect
title
to
sovereign
lands
against
federal
officials
and/or
the
federal
government.
such
a
decision
would
be
in
accord
with
over
150
years
of
case
law
history
recognizing
the
constitutional
equal
footing
doctrine
and
in
accord
with
the
submerged
lands
act.
as
to
that
submerged
lands
act,
i
would
simply
note
that
in
1953
the
congress
of
the
united
states
clearly
expressed
the
intent
and
the
will
of
congress
that
submerged
lands...
that
is
the
beds
navigable
rivers...
belonged
to
the
states.
it
was
a
specific
direction
to
keep
the
federal
government's
hands
off
them.
and,
insofar
as
the
little
missouri
river
is
a
navigable
river,
then
in
accordance
with
the
intent
of
the
congress,
the
federal
officials
in
this
case
ought
not
interfere
with
our
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
little
missouri
river.
thank
you
very
much.
