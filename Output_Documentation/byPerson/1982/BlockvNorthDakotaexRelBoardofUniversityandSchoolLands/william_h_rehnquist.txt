justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
could
they
have
made
such
a
claim,
mr.
claiborne,
before
the
enactment
of
the
quiet
title
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
claiborne,
you
said
the
state
should
have
been
aware
of
the
federal
claim
at
that
time.
now
that
is
a
whole
different
position
than
your
statement
that
the
state
asserted
no
interest
of
its
own.
what
could
the
state
have
done
before
the
enactment
of
the
quite
title
act,
if
it
did
become
aware
of
the
federal
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
your
view,
what
could
it
have
done?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
own
experience
in
private
practice
was
that
invitations
to
the
united
states
to
file
a
suit
to
quiet
title
were
not
often
accepted.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
that
enacted,
mr.
claiborne?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
effect
as
of
the
date
the
thing
came
into
effect
in
1972
of
a
claim,
say,
by
a
state
or
by
anybody
else
against
the
government,
which
had,
say,
accrued
in
1952?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
congress
had
enacted
no
quiet
title
act
here
that
authorized
suit
at
all?
what
could
the
state
have
done
with
respect
to
lands
which
it
claimed
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine?
what,
if
any,
as
against
the
federal
government?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
there
might
have
been
an
eminent
domain
type
of...
jacobs
type
of
cause
of
action
before
1972,
but
not
afterwards,
or
congress
would
have
specified
the
procedure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
issue
of
navigability
before
us?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
how
does
it
relate...
what
is
the
threshold
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
you
have
to
decide
whether
a
stream
is,
in
fact,
navigable
before
you
can
decide
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
against
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
finding
as
to
navigability.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
government
has
not
challenged
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
i
would
think
you
would
be
safe
in
assuming
that
we
would
all
assume
it
was
navigable.
