mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
dispute
is
over
the
bed
of
the
little
missouri
river
in
western
north
dakota,
so
far
as
that
river
lies
in
that
state.
this
is
a
river
which
has
been
described
as
a
raging
torrent
in
the
summertime
and
a
bare
trickle
in
the
winter.
it
is
one
as
to
which
an
explorer
with
the
lewis
and
clark
expedition
in
1804,
after
struggling
down
it
for
45
days,
emphatically
declared
it
non-navigable.
nevertheless,
the
state
of
north
dakota
now
claims
that
bed
on
the
ground
that
it
was
at
the
time
of
its
admission
to
the
state
in
1889
and
today
a
navigable
stream.
we
put
out
of
mind
the
last
35
miles
or
so
of
the
stream
where
it
borders
or
traverses
an
indian
reservation.
that
portion
of
the
riverbed
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
but,
for
the
rest
the
state
claims
the
whole
of
the
bed
saying
that
that
bed
as
the
bottom
of
a
navigable
water
body
inured
to
the
state
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
at
statehood
and
by
virtue
of
its
organic
act
and
by
confirmation
in
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953.
the
united
states,
on
the
other
hand,
claims
substantial
portions
of
the
same
riverbed...
perhaps,
as
much
as
a
third
of
that
riverbed.
the
federal
claim
is
based
on
the
opposite
proposition
that
the
river
was
not
and
is
not
navigable,
and
therefore
did
not
inure
to
the
state
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
or
submerged
lands
act.
the
united
states
claims
partly
as
riparian
owner
of
the
land
immediately
on
the
banks
of
the
river,
sometimes
the
mineral
estates,
sometimes
the
surface
estates,
sometimes
both.
some
of
these
are
public
lands
reserved
and
retained
by
the
united
states
since
the
beginning.
some
of
them
are
lands
reacquired
subsequently.
in
some
cases,
the
united
states
claims
the
bed,
but
not
the
riparian
land.
that
occurred
because
the
state,
which
was
graded
like
most
states,
section
16
and
36,
the
school
sections
in
its
organic
act,
determined
to
reject
the
submerged
portions
of
those
sections
and
to
condemnity
lands
elsewhere,
thereby
waiving
its
claim
to
the
bed
in
those
sections
16
and
36.
as
the
evidence
of
navigability
in
this
case
suggests...
and
we
say
it
suggests
the
non-navigability
of
the
river...
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
state
made
no
claim
with
respect
to
this
bed
for
the
better
part
of
the
first
century
since
it
was
admitted
to
the
state.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
am
saying
they
never
asserted
ownership,
justice
rehnquist,
by
leasing
or
by
granting
patents
with
respect
to
portions
of
the
bed,
or
easements,
or
taking
any
other
action
which
indicates
their
assertion
of
dominion
with
respect
to
that
bed.
indeed,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
north
dakota
never
asserted
in
any
way
any
claim
of
ownership
vis-a-vis
the
united
states
or
vis-a-vis
private
landowners
until
at
the
earliest
1962.
on
the
contrary,
in
1955
when
the
bureau
of
land
management
of
the
department
of
the
interior
specifically
asked
the
state
attorney
general
whether
in
the
state's
view,
the
river
was
or
had
been
at
statehood
navigable
and
accordingly
appertained
to
the
state,
the
express
answer
came
back,
"no,
this
river
has
not
and
is
not
now
navigable.
"
shortly,
thereafter
the
united
states
began
leasing
portions
of
the
bed,
treating
it
as
property
of
the
united
states.
there
were
some
39
such
oil
and
gas
leases
by
october,
1966,
more
than
12
years
before
this
suit
was
filed,
approximately
100
since
that
time.
in
1962,
the
united
states
began
leasing
competitively
which
required
publication
and
notice,
and
we
say,
a
further
reason
why
the
state
should
have
been
aware
of
the
federal
claim.
now,
apparently,
in
that
same
year,
1962,
the
state
itself
granted--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--according
to
the
state's
argument,
it
could
have
filed
suit,
regardless
of
the
quiet
title
act.
we
take
the
opposite
position,
but--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--but
the
state
could
have
granted
leases.
it
could
have
asserted
its
ownership
without...
even
if
it
were
unable
to
file
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
or
it
could
have--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--indeed.
and
it
could
at
least
have
notified
the
united
states
that
it
claimed
the
bed,
and
invited
the
united
states
to
file
a
suit
to
settle
the
matter
judicially.
it
did
none
of
any
of
those
things.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
justice
rehnquist,
our
record
in
this
respect
may
be
uneven,
but
my
impression
is
that
the
united
states
has
been
rather
receptive
to
overcoming
the
power
of
sovereign
immunity
by
itself
instituting
an
action
to
determine
judicially
a
disputed
land
claim
with
states.
that
has
been
the
history
of
the
submerged
lands
act
since
the
first
california
case
through
the
more
recent
case
involving
the
atlantic
coast
states,
united
states
v.
maine.
all
of
those
suits
were
those
which
could
not
have
been
brought
by
the
state,
but
which
the
united
states,
though
maintaining
its
ownership,
determined
it
was
only
right
and
proper
to
have
tested
in
this
court.
in
this
case,
had
that
been
the
view
of
the
united
states,
we
would
have
instituted
such
a
suit.
in
our
view,
this
claim
is
simply
so
lacking
in
merit,
it
does
not
justify
such
an
action.
in
all
events,
they
were
rather
indications
of
the
state's
disclaimer
of
ownership
after
notice.
but
i
will
not
burden
the
court
with
those
details.
that
is
not
what
this
court
is
asked
to
decide.
there
is
a
question
that
undecided
whether
sufficient
notice
was
given
by
the
courts
below,
and
if
our
position
prevails
the
case
would
have
to
be
returned
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination...
a
finding
on
that
question.
at
all
events,
in
1978
the
state
filed
suit
asserting
its
title
to
the
bed
and
seeking
to
enjoin
the
federal
officials
from,
in
their
words,
asserting
ownership
through
the
granting
of
leases
and
other
activity.
the
question
is
whether
that
suit
was
filed
too
late.
now,
although
the
state
sued
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
the
chief
of
the
forest
service
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
land
management,
we
asserted
in
defense
to
the
state's
suit
that
this
was
in
reality
a
suit
against
the
united
states
to
quiet
title
to
land
in
which
the
united
states
claimed
an
interest.
and,
accordingly
a
suit
governed
by
the
federal
quiet
title
act,
section
2409a
of
the
judicial
code.
the
district
court
agreed
and
required
the
state
to
amend
its
complaint
to
allege
that
jurisdictional
basis.
at
this
point,
the
question
before
the
court
was
whether
the
limitations
provision
of
the
quiet
title
act
applied.
now,
that
limitations
provision,
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
3,
is
subsection
(f)
of
2409a.
and,
it
provides
as
follows:
"any
civil
action"...
i
stress
the
word
"any"...
"under
this
section
shall
be
barred
unless
it
is
commenced
within
twelve
years
of
the
date
upon
which
it
accrued.
"
"such
action
shall
be
deemed
to
have
accrued
on
the
date
the
plaintiff
or
his
predecessor
in
interest
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
claim
of
the
united
states.
"
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
1972,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
such
a
claim
would
be
barred
because
while
as
originally
proposed
there
was
a
grandfather
clause
allowing
stale
claims
to
be
filed
within
a
short
period.
ultimately
the
congress
agreed
with
the
suggestion
of
the
federal
representatives
that
that
would
open
the
doors
to
too
many
claims
and
that
rather
than
have
a
six-year
period
it
would
reach
back
twelve
years.
but,
there
would
be
no
grandfather
clause
for
claims
more
stale
than
that.
now,
assuming
that
statute
and
that
limitations
provision
of
the
statute
applied,
the
second
question
was
whether
the
state
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the
federal
claim
more
than
12
years
before
the
suit
was
filed.
the
state's
stance
in
the
district
court
and
ever
since
was
that
the
limitations
provision
was
inapplicable
and
that
the
state
accordingly
should
focus
its
attention
on
the
issue
of
navigability.
the
united
states,
on
the
other
hand,
focused
on
the
threshold
question,
the
jurisdictional
question,
the
limitations
question,
and
produced
evidence
with
respect
to
state
knowledge
of
the
federal
claim
more
than
12
years
before
the
suit
was
filed
and
argued
that
accordingly
the
action
should
be
dismissed.
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
state
holding
that
the
limitations
provision
was
inapplicable
under
these
circumstances
and,
therefore,
made
no
finding
with
respect
to
whether
the
state
had
knowledge,
actual
or
constructive,
12
years
before
the
suit
was
filed.
and
reaching
the
merits,
the
district
court
found
that
the
river
was,
indeed,
navigable,
and
accordingly
that
the
state
had
ownership.
on
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
on
both
points,
and
accordingly
affirmed.
we
petitioned
in
this
court
solely
on
the
limitations
point,
not
because
we
concede
the
navigability
of
the
river,
but
because
we
felt
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
burden
this
court
with
a
purely
fact-bound
question
of
the
navigability
of
this
particular
river.
we
argued
in
all
courts,
including
in
this
court,
that
the
courts
should
not
have
reached
the
issue
of
navigability
because
they
had
no
jurisdiction,
the
action
having
been
barred
by
limitations.
our
argument
is
entirely
straightforward.
we
say
this
is
an
action
which
is
in
effect
a
suit
to
divest
the
united
states
of
lands
which
it
claims
to
own,
which
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity
except
only
as
congress
has
waived
that
bar.
we
say
this
principle
applies
to
states
as
well
as
private
citizens.
we
note
that
in
1972
congress
did
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
the
quiet
title
act,
section
2409a,
in
respect
of
this
class
of
suit,
but
it
did
so
on
express
conditions.
and,
one
of
those
conditions,
subsection
(f)
of
the
statute,
is
that
the
suit
be
filed
within
12
years
after
knowledge,
actual
or
constructive,
of
the
federal
claim.
now,
since
as
the
district
court
held
and
the
court
of
appeals
assumed,
rightly,
we
think,
north
dakota
must
invoke
this
statute.
it
must,
like
any
other
plaintiff,
invoking
the
benefits
of
the
statute
also
be
bound
by
the
conditions,
including
the
limitations
provision.
we
see
no
basis
for
creating
a
special
exception
because
north
dakota's
claim
of
title
here
is
constitutionally
derived
in
the
sense
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
responsible
for
the
state's
alleged
ownership
of
the
riverbed.
constitutional
rights,
like
any
others,
can
be
barred
by
the
failure
to
assert
them
within
a
given
time.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
say,
justice
rehnquist,
first
that
so
far
as
that
claim
was
alleged
against
the
united
states...
and,
of
course,
i
put
aside
such
a
claim
against
private
individuals
as
to
which
there
is
no
bar...
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
would
have
prevented
the
bringing
of
such
an
action.
alternatively,
we
say
that
even
if
that
were
not
true,
since
1972
congress
has
provided
a
leachant
procedure
for
the
assertion
of
such
claims
by
states
of
others
and
that
the
state
has
failed
to
comply
with
the
conditions
of
that
limited
procedure.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
so.
though,
if
we
had
a
different
situation
in
which
the
united
states
for
the
first
time
seemed
to
be
taking
the
state's
sovereign
lands,
even
after
1972,
the
state
would
have
the
option
of
either
suing
us
under
the
quiet
title
act
or
suing
us...
put
claims
under
the
tucker
act.
and,
indeed,
one
of
the
novelties
of
this
case
is
that
the
quiet
title
act
provides
that
if
the
united
states
wishes
to
keep
the
property,
notwithstanding
the
judgment
is
going
against
it,
it
may
do
so.
and,
to
that
extent
the
injunction
entered
by
the
district
court
is
in
any
event
improper.
now,
as
i
say,
constitutional
rights,
like
any
other
rights,
can
be
barred
by
the
failure
to
assert
them
timely.
the
classical
example
being
rights
under
the
just
compensation
clause
which
this
court
and
other
courts
have
held
are
barred
if
not
filed
within
six
years.
states
are
subject
to
limitations,
witness
this
court's
venerable
decision
in
louisiana
v.
united
states.
state
land
claims
can
be
barred
altogether
by
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states.
that
is
true
with
respect
to
trust
lands
that
have
been
granted
to
the
states
in
its
organic
act
as
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
indicate,
and
as
the
most
recent
decision
of
this
court
bearing
on
the
subject,
california
v.
arizona
indicates
that
is
true
even
with
respect
to
the
equal
footing
doctrine
lands.
in
california
v.
arizona
the
court
said
explicitly,
this
suit
would
be
barred
but
for
the
quiet
title
act.
and
the
court
then
construed
the
quiet
title
act
as
waiving
sovereign
immunity,
not
merely
in
the
district
courts
but
also
in
this
court.
a
holding
wholly
unnecessary
if
such
a
claim
was
in
no
event
stopped
by
sovereign
immunity.
now,
of
course,
congress
cannot
take
away
what
the
constitution
has
given.
congress
cannot
take
away
what
congress
itself
has
given
irrevocably.
but
there
is
no
taking
here
in
that
sense.
congress'
failure
to
lift
the
bar
of
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
taking.
much
less
does
a
limitations
provision,
condition
of
such
suit,
amount
to
a
taking.
rights
without
a
remedy
may
be
rare
in
the
law,
but
sovereign
immunity
is
a
classic
example
of
such
rights.
all
sovereigns,
including
the
state
of
north
dakota,
invoke
that
doctrine
from
time
to
time.
here
we
do
not
have
a
right
without
any
remedy.
we
simply
have
a
limited
remedy.
as
i
have
said,
the
united
states
by
and
large
has
been
receptive
to
paving
the
way
to
the
judicial
resolution
of
state
claims,
which
were
otherwise
barred
by
sovereign
immunity,
by
itself
instituting
the
law
suit.
but
there
is
a
limit
to
all
good
deeds.
here
the
united
states
determined
not
to
file
its
own
action,
at
least
not
yet,
and
that
is
the
essence
of
sovereign
immunity,
the
prerogative
not
to
waive
the
prerogative.
now,
the
practical
importance
of
this
question
is
substantial.
if
anything
needs
security,
it
is
land
titles.
if
the
state
were
free
after
adequate
notice
and
almost
a
century
of
default
to
reopen
claims
to
water
bottoms
on
the
ground
that
at
statehood
the
river
was
navigable,
there
would
be
a
spate
of
litigation.
indeed,
judging
from
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case,
filed
by
some
30
states,
there
are
that
many
states
ready,
eager
to
file
stale
claims
against
the
united
states
with
respect
to
submerged
lands.
they
say,
potentially
50
million
acres
are
at
stake.
that
seems
to
us
a
strong
argument
for
holding
the
line
against
claims
that
are
so
stale
that
after
notice
they
have
not
been
filed
for
12
years
or
more.
for
these
reasons,
we
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
courts
below
insofar
as
they
held
the
limitations
provision
of
the
quiet
title
act
inapplicable,
to
vacate
the
declaratory
judgment
with
respect
to
navigability
on
the
ground
that
the
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
to
reach
that
issue,
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
so
as
to
have
it
enter
a
finding
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
north
dakota
had
the
requisite
notice
of
the
federal
claim
more
than
12
years
before
it
filed
this
action.
i
reserve
what
balance
of
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
briefly.
first,
justice
stevens
gave
a
better
answer
in
his
question
to
justice
rehnquist
than
i
did.
when
justice
rehnquist
said
what
could
the
state
have
done
if
it
claimed
the
bed
of
this
river
before
1978?
one
answer
is
it
could
have
sued
the
private
landowners
who
enjoyed
no
sovereign
immunity
and
who,
i
assume,
having
two-thirds
of
the
river,
were
likewise
granting
leases
or
otherwise
exerting
ownership
over
what
they
thought
was
their
portion
of
the
riverbed.
no
such
suit
has,
to
this
date,
been
filed.
now,
addressing
justice
white's
query
with
respect
to
the
alternative
basis
for
affirmance
urged
by
north
dakota,
it
is
fair
to
remind
the
court
that
north
dakota
filed
a
conditional
cross
petition
of
certiorari
as
to
which
the
court
has
taken
no
action.
although,
we
oppose
that
cross
petition
on
reconsideration
in
our
brief,
we
urge
the
court
to
consider
the
issue
raised
there
if
that
issue
is
not
otherwise
available
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
because
it
seems
to
us
wasteful
and,
indeed,
perhaps
only
an
advisory
opinion
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
if
quiet
title
act
applies
certain
results
follow
without
first
deciding
whether
it
is
the
necessary
predicate
for
this
lawsuit.
we
have
addressed
in
our
brief
the
question
whether
this
is
a
suit
within
the
exception
of
bowdoin
and
malone
and
the
larson
case.
that
is
discussed
at
pages
17
to
24
of
our
brief.
we
conclude,
and
i
do
not
have
the
time
to
recite
it
here,
that
this
is
not
one
of
those
exceptional
cases
in
which
one
may
sue
the
officer
rather
than
the
sovereign
on
the
ground
that
the
officer
is
acting
unconstitutionally.
this
is
not
an
officer
straying
on
a
frolic
of
his
own.
this
is
an
officer
acting
on
the
basis
of
the
sovereign
title
of
the
united
states.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
a
suit
to
determine
title.
and
the
judgment
quiets
title
in
north
dakota.
but,
we
do
go
on,
as
justice
white
suggested
in
questioning
my
brother
the
attorney
general...
to
say
even
if
this
suit
did
lie,
or
could
have
lain,
before
1972
as
a
suit
against
the
officer
not
barred
by
sovereign
immunity,
what
congress
sought
to
do
in
1972,
among
other
things,
in
passing
the
quiet
title
act
was
to
say
this
area
of
suits
against
federal
officers
is
unclear.
no
one
knows
with
assurance
whether
in
certain
circumstances
such
a
suit
will
or
will
not
lie.
we
will
simplify
the
law
and
we
will
authorize
suits
directly
against
the
united
states
with
respect
to
land
provided
such
suits
are
filed
within
12
years.
we
say
that
from
that
time--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
was
not
formally
made
a
party,
although
it
should
have
been.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--well,
the
quiet
title
act
says
the
united
states
may
be
joined.
i
take
that
to
mean,
must
be
joined
in
order
for
this
action
to
proceed.
the
district
court
having
held
that
the
suit
must
be...
that
the
complaint
must
be
amended
to
allege
2409a,
should
have
further
required
that
the
united
states
be
formally
joined.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
nobody
objected.
the
united
states
responded
as
the
united
states,
and
the
judgment
runs
against
the
united
states,
and
that
technical
omission
is
one
that
has
never
been
raised
in
this
case.
but,
your
honor
is
right
that
there
is
a
technical
defect
in
that
respect.
in
all
events,
at
page
29
and
the
following
pages
of
our
brief
we
address
this
alternative
point
that
from
1972
onward
congress
determined
that
all
such
suits,
whether
or
not
they
would
previously
lie
against
the
officer,
should
now
be
filed
under
the
following
conditions...
the
limitations
provision
is
not
the
only
condition...
against
the
united
states
itself,
and
we
see
in
that
enactment
no
preservation
of
any
previous
alternative,
but,
on
the
contrary,
a
regular
arising
of
a
now
unique
procedure
which
is
more
satisfactory
than
all
the
skirmishing
that
had
gone
before
about
whether
this
was
properly
a
suit
against
the
officer
or
not.
and,
on
that
alternative
ground,
we
urge
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
well.
