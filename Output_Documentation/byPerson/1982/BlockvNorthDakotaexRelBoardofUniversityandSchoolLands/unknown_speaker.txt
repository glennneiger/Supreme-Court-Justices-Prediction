unknown
speaker
didn't
the
federal
government
give
up
sovereignty
on
its
act...
quiet
title
act?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh,
allowing
itself
to
be
sued.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
it
put
a
condition
on
that?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
that
accurate?
why
can't
you
give
up
some
of
your
own
conditions
and
the
next
question,
don't
you
have
to
abide
by
the
condition?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
are
more
sovereign
than
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position
that--
unknown
speaker
--the
state
is
more
sovereign
that
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
there
are
not
so
many
dual
leases
any
more.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
had
not
been
the
quiet
title
act?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
do
about
it?
unknown
speaker
against
the
secretary?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
is
right.
suppose
we
agreed
with
you
on
that.
could
this
judgment
be
affirmed
on
that
ground?
unknown
speaker
would
it
be
proper
to
affirm
it
on
that
ground?
is
that
issue
before
us,
or
was--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
that?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
proper
at
this
state?
unknown
speaker
would
there
be
any
statute
of
limitations?
suppose
this
were
held
not
to
be
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
but
just
against
a
state
officer
or
against
a
federal
officer
to
tell
him
to
keep
his
hands
off
of--
unknown
speaker
--state
property,
is
there
a
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
no
statute
of
limitations,
ever?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
opposition
is
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
but
you
surely
are
not
saying
that
simply
because
this
is
a
riparian
bed
that
the
state
of
north
dakota
has
a
sovereignty
in
the
governmental
sense
over
it
superior
to
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
but
sovereignty
is
only
in
the
sense
that
you
get
those
lands
at
the
time
you
are
admitted
to
the
union--
unknown
speaker
--but
at
the
time
you
were
admitted
to
the
union
as
when
you
were
a
territory,
you
are
still
subject
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask...
have
claims
comparable
to
the
dispute
between
the
state
and
the
united
states
arisen
between
the
state
and
private
riparian
owners
who
may
also
be
claiming
parts
of
the
riverbed?
unknown
speaker
is
that
because
the
united
states
is
the
riparian
owner
all
along
the
river,
or
you
just
have
not
asserted
any
such
claims
against
private
owners?
unknown
speaker
the
private
owners
have
a
claim
to
title
that
parallels
the
united
states'
claim.
as
i
understand
it,
its
claim
is
based...
part
of
the
bed
is
based
on
the
fact
that
it
is
a
riparian
owner.
unknown
speaker
aren't
there
some
private
riparian
owners?
unknown
speaker
but
i
am
just
wondering...
but
no
such
fights
have
arisen?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
you
treat
the
private
claimants
of
north
dakota
just
like
you
say
the
government
is
treating
north
dakota.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
the
united
states'
position
to
be
that
even
if
you
could
have
sued
secretary
block
or
the
secretary
of
interior
before
the
quiet
title
act
was
passed,
and
it
would
not
have
been
held
to
be
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
just
assume
that.
with
the
passage
of
the
quiet
title
act...
that
the
quiet
title
act
erase
the
possibility
of
that
suit
as
well
as
a
suit
directly
against
the
united
states
unless
brought
within
12
years?
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
present
to
the
court
of
appeals
your
alternate
basis
for--
unknown
speaker
--jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals--
unknown
speaker
--did
not
reach
it...
didn't
have
to.
unknown
speaker
you
are
presenting
that
here
as
an
alternate
ground?
unknown
speaker
then
it
is
a
suit
to
determine
title?
unknown
speaker
was
the
united
states
made
a
party
here,
mr.
claiborne?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
the
quiet
title
act
require
that
the
united
states
be
made
a
party?
unknown
speaker
nobody
has
objected?
