justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
question
if
this
is
what
in
effect
you
are
arguing
that
if
the
state
had
acquired
title
not
through
its
sovereign
status
and
the
navigability
of
the
river
and
so
forth,
but
rather
by
purchase
from
a
private
person
and
so
forth,
would
you
concede
the
statute
of
limitations
would
bar
the
claim
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
you
are
saying
the
statute
does
not
bar
a
state
claim
of
this
kind
although
it
might
bar
other
state
claims.
