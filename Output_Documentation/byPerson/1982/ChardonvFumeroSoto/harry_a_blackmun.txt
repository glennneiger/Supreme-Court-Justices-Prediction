justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
on
american
pipe?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
that
american
pipe
selected
a
suspension
rule
and
rejected
a
renewal
rule,
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
my
question
isn't
really
whether
that
is
isn't
dictum
in
american
pipe,
because
under
either
rule
those
plaintiffs
have
been
taken
care
of.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
plaintiffs'
claims
there
were
found
to
be
timely
under
the
suspension
rule,
but
wouldn't
they
have
been
timely
under
a
renewal
rule
as
well,
and
therefore
isn't
the
statement
on
which
you
rely
in
american
pipe
dictum?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
start
over
again.
your
position
is
that
american
pipe
selected
a
suspension
rule,
and
you
hesitate
a
little
by
saying,
well,
maybe
it
didn't
reject
a
renewal
rule,
and
my
point
is
that
even
if
it
did
purport
to
select
a
suspension
rule,
wouldn't
that
aspect
of
the
decision
be
dictum?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff's
claims
would
have
been
timely
under
either
rule.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
in
american
pipe.
therefore
it
is
dictum.
