justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
something
you
said
about
the
puerto
rico
law?
as
i
understood
you,
you
said
the
first
circuit
fashioned
the
tolling
rule--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--by
applying...
by
saying
that
puerto
rico
would
in
effect
apply
a
counterpart
to
the
american
pipe
case,
but
is
it
not
true
that
with
respect
to
the
second
question,
namely,
for
how
long
the
tolling
period
is,
that
they
relied
on
puerto
rico
law
for
saying
the
statute
starts
to
run
all
over
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
position
really,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
is
not
that
they
tolled
it
for
the
wrong
period,
but
there
should
have
been
no
tolling
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
another
difficulty--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--with
your
argument,
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
first
found
that
there
was
no
puerto
rican
authority
for
tolling
in
the
first
instance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
they...
i
don't
see...
page
16-a
of
the
opinion
says
that
the
puerto
rican
law
provides
there
is
tolling
when
an
identical
cause
of
action
is
filed,
and
then
they
say
the
class
action
is
an
identical
cause
of
action,
and
therefore
under
puerto
rico
law
there
is
tolling.
that
is
the
way
i
read
it
anyway.
what
language
do
you
rely
on
for
a
different
reading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
the
substantive
claims
asserted
in
the
class
action
were
identical
to
those
in
the
subsequent
individual
actions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
there
is
a
puerto
rican
law...
a
rule
that
if
it
is
an
identical
action,
there
is
a
toll.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
question
is
whether
a
class
action
comes
within
that
rule.
that's
the
question,
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
were
telling
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
puerto
rican
law
was
silent
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
in
fact--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
i
didn't
find
in
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
relying
on
your
cert
position.
i
hadn't
found
that
argument
in
your
brief.
that
is
why
i
was
having
trouble
following
it
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
have
the
identity
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
notice
that
in
that
part
of
the
opinion,
that's
the
paragraph
after
they
had
decided
that
the
class
action
was
identical,
and
where
they
were
rejecting
the
estoppel
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
any
event,
you
really
are
asking
us
to
make
a
fairly
close
examination
of
puerto
rican
law,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
second-guess
the
first
circuit
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
what
is
the
source
of
law
that
determined
the
fact
that
there
should
be
tolling?
was
it
federal
or
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
the
consequence
would
have
been
if
the
federal
rule
23
read
the
way
justice
white
says,
that
there
always
should
be
tolling
for
just
this
period,
and
there
were
a
puerto
rican
statute
that
said
there
shall
not
be
tolling
in
any
class
action...
class
action
shall
not
toll?
what
would
be
the
right
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
asking,
would
there
be...
would
there
be
tolling
if
you
had
a
conflict
between
the
language
of
rule
23,
that
talked
about
class
actions
generally,
and
you
had
these
individual
actions
in
which
the
plaintiffs
would
claim
there
was
tolling
on
the
basis
of
rule
23
but
the
defendants
would
say,
no,
but
we
have
a
puerto
rican
statute
that
says
we
never
toll.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
would
the
limitations
issue
be
any
different
if
this
litigation,
which
is
an
individual
litigation
following
the
class
action,
had
been
filed
in
the
state
court
rather
than
the
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
if
justice
white's
hypothesis
is
right,
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
which
applies
and
which
dictates
the
consequence
of
any
class
action--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
any
federal
claim
later
asserted,
what
difference
would
it
make
if
the
federal
claim--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
puerto
rico
court
is
entertaining
the
federal
claim,
federal
cause
of
action
under
1983.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
logic
of
the
contrary
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
substantive
matter
in
a
1983
case.
it
is
a
federal
claim,
even
though
it
is
heard
in
the
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
is...
that
argument
is
just
as
strong
if
the
case
is
in
the
federal
court
as
it
is
in
the
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
is
a
rhetorical
question.
no,
but
your
argument...
your
argument
is
that
it
is
a
procedural
matter,
and
if
it
is
a
procedural
matter,
under
1988,
governed
by
state
law,
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
just
as
strong
whether
the
individual's
action
that
follows
the
class
action
is
filed
in
federal
court
or
in
state
court.
i
don't
see
the
distinction
between--
