justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
partly
wouldn't
you
also
say,
mr.
degooyer,
that
the
last
paragraph
of
the
court
opinion
in
american
pipe
and
construction,
which
at
least
your
opponents
read
to
suggest
made
that
the
suspension
aspect
of
the
ruling
depend
on
the
clayton
act
rather
than
on
a
rule
peculiar
to
federal
class
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
disagree
with
my
statement
or
with
your
opponent's...
what
i
think
is
your
opponent's
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
are
really
two
quite
distinct
positions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
it
your
underlying
position
is
that
american
pipe
is
based
on
the
rule
23
class
actions--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
provides
a
federal
rule
of
tolling
no
matter
what
the
substantive
origin
of
the
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
first
circuit
did
hold
otherwise,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
true...
federal
courts
lots
of
times
have
to
do
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
diversity
cases,
or
in
a
case
like
this,
where
they
have
to
say,
true,
there
isn't
a
decided
puerto
rico
case
on
the
subject.
we
have
got
to
figure
out
what
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
would
do.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
based
almost
entirely,
isn't
it,
on
v
of
the
opinion
in
that
last
paragraph?
it
seems
to
me
you
can
read
the
other
parts,
from
i
through
iv,
and
sense
that
the
court
isn't
relying
much,
if
at
all,
on
the
nature
of
the
substantive
cause
of
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
clayton
act
itself
didn't
in
haec
verba
provide
for
this
kind
of
tolling,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
rule
26
or
whatever
rule
it
is
that
allows
an
imposition
of
sanctions
for
violation
of
discovery
may
not
say
anything
about
dismissal,
but
certainly
the
courts
were
free
to
find
that
dismissal
was
an
appropriate
sanction.
i
think
most
courts
in
saying
that
would
say
they
were
interpreting
rule
26.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
are
talking
about
really
fashioning
a
tolling
rule
in
two
different
ways
under
federal,
aren't
you?
in
tomanio
the
question
was,
do
you
fashion
a
federal
rule
solely
for
1983
type
cases
under
1988
rather
than
a
federal
rule
all
across
the
board
based
on
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
don't
have
the
right
to
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that
is
erie
analysis,
isn't
it?
ragan
was
basically
an
erie
type
analysis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
rule
in
diversity
under
erie
where
you
want
the
case
to
come
out
the
same
way
in
state
courts...
in
federal
courts
as
it
would
in
state
courts?
that
may
have
no
application
to
a
non-diversity
case.
