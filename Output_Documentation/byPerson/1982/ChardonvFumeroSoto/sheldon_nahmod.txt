mr.
sheldon
nahmod
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
as
counsel
for
petitioners
observed,
we
are
here
dealing
with
36
cases.
thirty-six
plaintiffs,
who
are
the
respondents
here,
were
found
by
a
puerto
rico
jury
to
have
lost
their
jobs
for
political
reasons.
they
belonged
to
the
wrong
political
party.
the
issue
in
the
case,
as
set
out
earlier,
is
the
following.
does
puerto
rico
tolling
law,
that
is,
the
puerto
rico
tolling
law
of
renewal,
govern
the
denial
of
class
certification
for
lack
of
numerosity,
or
does
some
other
rule
when
we
are
talking
about
section
1983
federal
class
actions?
indeed,
we
are
talking
about
more
than
section
1983.
we
are
talking
about
section
1981,
1982,
1985,
and
1986
as
well.
there
are
two
considerations
that
i
was
hoping
to
mention
at
the
outset.
the
first
consideration
is
that
puerto
rico
has
a
very
strong
interest
in
having
its
tolling
rule
apply.
the
puerto
rico
tolling
rule
of
renewal
reflects
puerto
rico's
judgment
as
to
the
proper
balance
between
repose
on
the
one
hand
and
fairness
to
injured
parties
on
the
other.
there
is
a
related
interest
in
federalism.
puerto
rico
has
a
spanish
civil
law
based
system.
louisiana
has
a
comparable
civil
law
system,
but
it
is
based
upon
the
french
civil
law.
a
second
threshold
consideration
is
that
there
was
no
unfair
surprise
to
the
defendants
in
these
cases
because
they
knew
about
all
of
these
plaintiffs'
causes
of
action.
no
unfair
surprise,
no
lost
witnesses,
no
stale
memory
at
issue
in
these
36
cases.
by
way
of
background
it
is
important,
i
think,
to
start
off
with
this
court's
decision
in
tomanio.
as
a
general
matter,
this
court
in
interpreting
section
1988
has
held
that
where
federal
statutory
law
is
deficient,
a
federal
court
must
look,
must
look
at
relevant
state
law
unless
that
relevant
state
law
is
inconsistent.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
not
at
all,
your
honor.
that
is
our
second
argument,
that--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--yes,
that's
one.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
maybe
i
didn't
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
if
section
1983
itself
contained
a
statute
of
limitations,
then
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
your
honor--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--yes,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
they
are
basing
their
primary
reliance
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
american
pipe
case.
in
so
doing,
we
submit
that
they
misread
it.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
american
pipe
decision
can
be
broken
down
into
two
important
aspects,
it
seems
to
me.
the
first
aspect
is
what
we
call
in
our
brief
general
tolling.
that
is,
when
a
federal
class
action
is
filed,
whether
it
is
a
23(b)(1),
(b)(2),
or
(b)(3)
class
action,
as
american
pipe
was--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor,
then
we
would...
there
would
be
no
tolling.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
your
honor,
that
depends
upon
which
one
of
our
first
two
arguments
one
looks
at.
it
seems
to
us
with
respect
to
an
interpretation
of
american
pipe
that
this
court
held
in
american
pipe
that
one
looks
at
the
limitation
scheme
underlying
the
particular
substantive
cause
of
action.
in
a
section
in
the
american
pipe
case
itself,
the
substantive
cause
of
action
was
section
5(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
that
provision
provided...
that
provision
set
out
a
suspension
approach
to
tolling.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
but
it
was
based
upon
this
court's--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--your
honor,
when
the
court
in
american
pipe
was
trying
to
balance
the
rule
23
interests
on
the
one
hand
against
the
appropriate
interest
in
the
statutes
of
limitation
on
the
other,
this
court
appropriately,
in
our
opinion,
looked
to
the
congressional
purpose
underlying
the
particular
substantive
cause
of
action.
there
are
numerous...
there
are
at
least
three
different
approaches
to
tolling
that
this
court
could
have
used
in
the
american
pipe
case.
one
possible
approach
to
tolling
is
an
extension
approach.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
and
that
is
because
the
clayton
act
itself
provided
for
suspension.
i
think
this
court
in
american
pipe
felt
bound
to
look
at
what
congress
had
said.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
well,
your
honor,
suppose--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--but,
your
honor,
our
position
is,
suppose
in
american
pipe
the
clayton
act
limitations
and
tolling
schemes
had
provided
for
renewal
of
the
period
of
limitations.
we
submit
that
this
court
in
american
pipe
would
have
set
out
a
tolling
rule
of
renewal,
but
this--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--your
honor,
that
is
because...
i
understand
what
you
are
saying.
that
is
because
the
major
portion
of
the
american
pipe
case
dealt
with
the
general
relationship
between
rule
23
on
the
one
hand
and
statutes
of
limitation
in
general.
this
court
was
explaining
why,
even
with
a
so-called
spurious
or
rule
23(b)(3)
class
action,
this
court
was
explaining
why
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
tolled
for
all
unnamed
members
of
a
class
once
a
class
action
was
filed
in
federal
court.
that
is
the
body,
that
is
the
major
portion
of
the
court's
opinion.
when
it
set
out
all
of
this
in
general
terms,
it
then
went
on
to
deal
with
the
issue
that
we
are
addressing
here:
what
is
the
precise
effect
of
our
general
discussion
in
this
particular
case?
and
the
precise
tolling
effect
had
to
be
obtained
by
looking
at
the
clayton
act
itself,
in
the
same
way
that
we
suggest
in
this
case,
in
these
36
cases,
a
federal
court
would
have
to
look
at
the
limitation
scheme
governing
section
1983
causes
of
action.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
the
clayton
act
on
its
terms,
on
its
own
face,
provided
only
for
suspension.
but
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean,
justice
rehnquist,
when
you
say
for
this
particular
kind
of
tolling.
can
you
explain
that?
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
but
this
court--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--i
think
that's
right,
but
i
think
this
court
had
to
choose
an
appropriate
rule
which
would
accommodate
the
interests
that
reflected
congressional
enactment
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
clayton
act
to
begin
with.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
well,
your
honor,
in
that
case,
we
would
have
to
skip
both
our
first
and
second
arguments
and
get
to
a
very
difficult
and
broad
issue
involving
the
validity
of
that
as
a
practical--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--not
constitutionality,
no.
we
have
raised
no
constitutional
issues
here.
we
are
talking
about
the--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--validity
as
applied
to
these
puerto
rico
plaintiffs
of
the
rule
23...
the
rules
enabling
act
issue.
this
will
be
a
rules
enabling
act
question.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
but
it
also
provides
in
relevant
part
that
the
rules
must
be
procedural
for
one
thing,
and
secondly,
they
must
not
abridge
substantive
rights
under
state
law.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
that
is
our
third
argument.
we
need
get
nowhere
near
the
third
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
if
we
read
american
pipe
narrowly.
this
was
our
first
argument
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
held
in
american
pipe
that
one
must
look
at
the
limitation
scheme
for
the
particular
substantive
cause
of
action,
and
when
we
have
a
section
1983
class
action,
as
justice
white
mentioned
earlier,
we
don't
have
a
particular
statute
of
limitations.
congress
has
left
that
open.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
of
course.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
rely
solely
on
state
law,
both
with
respect
to
general
tolling
effect
and
precise
tolling
effect.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
i
understand,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
a
rule
23
interpretation
now,
general--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--in
that
situation,
assuming
rule
23
as
applied
would
be
valid
under
the
rules
enabling
act,
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
we
would
concede
that.
if
i
understand
your
question.
if
rule
23
itself
provided
that
there
were
a
tolling
rule
of
suspension
in
all
class
actions.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
your
honor--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--your
honor,
that
gets...
your
honor,
we
submit
that
american
pipe
does
not
do
that.
the
american
pipe
rule
is
a
judicially
created
rule
reflecting--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--pardon?
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
it
is
not
an
interpretation
of
rule
23
as
such,
your
honor.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
it
is
a
judicially
created
common
law
procedural
rule.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
it
is
based
upon
or
related
to
the
interests
protected
by
rule
23,
but
your
honor,
rule
23
on
its
face
says
nothing
at
all
about
tolling.
the
advisory
committee
report--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--your
honor,
there
is
a
difference
in
our
opinion
between
a
judicial
decision
interpreting
a
rule
and
a
judicial
decision
which
sets
out
its
own
rule
simply
by
looking
at
interests
set
out
in,
say,
rule
23.
this
court
said
time
and
again
in
the
american
pipe
case
that
it
is
a
judicial...
judicially
created
tolling
rule
that
we
are
setting
forth.
this
court
was
concerned
in
american
pipe
with
its
power,
its
power
to
toll
statutes
of
limitations
in
federal
court.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
but
it
is
a
judicially
created--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--but
your
honor,
that
brings
us
to
section
1988,
because
section
1988
sets
out--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--and
we
would
submit
that
because
of
the
mandate
of
section
1988,
that
is
improper
to
do,
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
rejected
the
propriety
of
a
judicially
created
rule
of
tolling
in
the
board
of
regents
versus
tomanio
case,
in
the
same
way
this
court
rejected
the
propriety
of
a
judicially
created
rule
of
survivorship
in
robertson
v.
wegman.
it
is
inappropriate...
and
this
is
our
second
argument...
it
is
inappropriate
with
section
1983
class
actions.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
well,
your
honor,
the
concession--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--if
the
earlier
concession
was
limited,
we
would
still
argue,
even
if
rule
23
governed
this,
that
one
would
have
to
still
look
at
the
underlying
cause
of
action.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
for
its
limitation
scheme.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
yes,
your
honor.
we
suggest
that
when
this
court
spoke
in
the
tomanio
case
about
section
1988,
it
was
basing
its
reading
of
section
1988
on
the
existence
of
a
void
in
federal
statutory
law.
we
submit
that
the
judicial
tolling
rule
of
american
pipe
if
such
should
be
is
not
a
federal
statute.
it
is
a
judicially
created
rule.
it
doesn't
matter,
it
seems
to
us,
whether
that--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--not
at
all,
no.
section
1988
is
an
independent...
is
a
federal
statute
which
this
court
must
follow
in
section
1983
cases
and
other
cases
to
which
it
might
be
applicable.
this
court
does
not
have
the
power,
we
submit,
under
section
1988,
to
create
a
federal
procedural
common
law
in
this...
in
this
respect,
unless
it
is
inconsistent,
unless
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
policy
underlying
section
1983.
there
has
been
no
such
claim
by
the
petitioners
in
these
cases.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
one
of
our
points.
it
seems
to
us
that...
it
seems
to
us
that
if
indeed
the
petitioners
are
correct
in
their
argument,
then
it
would
make
a
difference
whether
a
section
1983
class
action
were
brought
in
federal
court
or
if
it
were
brought
in
state
court,
because
surely
with
respect
to
what
the
state
court
would
do,
it
would
apply
its
own
tolling
law
of
renewal.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
but
that
is
only...
that
is
only
procedural.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
well,
your
honor,
that
would
only
be,
under
justice
white's
approach,
a
rule
23
interpretation.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
certainly,
a
rule
23
interpretation
does
not
bind
a
puerto
rico
court
or
any
state
courts.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
a
rule...
we--
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
--we
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
this
court,
through
a
rule
23
interpretation,
would
be
setting
out
what
is
a
substantive
matter
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
substantive
law
in
the
same
way
as
the
question
of
when
a
federal
cause
of
action
accrues
this.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
how
so,
your
honor?
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
if
i
may
ask.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
am
sorry.
i
am
a
teacher.
i
am
unaccustomed...
i
apologize.
[generallaughter.]
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
your
honor,
our
third
argument
is
relevant
if
this
court,
first
of
all,
rejects
our
narrow
reading
of
american
pipe,
and
secondly,
it
rejects
our
section
1988
argument
with
respect
to
a
void
in
federal
statutory
law,
which
we
submit
exists,
because
the
american
pipe
rule
is
a
judicially
created
rule
of
tolling
and
does
not
apply,
and
is
not
federal
statutory
law.
if
the
american
pipe
case
is
a
rule
23
interpretation
across
the
board,
and
it
applies
to
all
federal
class
actions,
including
not
just
1983
class
actions
but
diversity
class
actions,
then
we
submit
that
it
would
raise
several...
some
very
serious
problems
under
the
rules
enabling
act,
at
least
as
applied
to
these
puerto
rico
plaintiffs,
because
the
rules
enabling
act
sets
out
a
limitation
on
congressional
power
and
this
court's
power
to
promulgate
rules
of
procedure.
such
rules
must
not
abridge
or
modify
substantive
rights.
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court
has
characterized
its
limitation
scheme
as
substantive.
now,
i
grant
you
that
is
not
enough,
because
whether
substantive
rights
are
abridged
by
a
federal
rule
is
a
question
of
federal
law,
not
a
question
predominantly
of
state
law,
but
yet
this
court
has
in
the
past
looked
to
the
importance
of
the
particular
limitations
scheme
or
the
particular
rule
of
the
state
and
asked
whether
that
is
substantive.
now,
the
court
has
done
so
on
the
ragan
case
and
even
more
recently
in
the
walker
case.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
yes,
but
we
are
using...
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
we
are
using
ragan
and
walker
for
the
proposition
that
one
cannot
separate
limitations
and
tolling
provisions
from
one
another.
mr.
sheldon
nahmod
it
may
have
no
application
to
a
non-diversity
case,
your
honor,
but
as
we
have
argued,
this
is
a
section
1983
case,
and
congress
has
left
certain
matters
silent
in
section
1983
cases.
one
of
those
matters
is
a
limitation
scheme
and
its
tolling
provisions.
so,
there
is
only
an
analogy
to
the
rules
of
decision
act.
we
don't
claim
that
the
rules
of
decision
act
applies
here.
i
think
this
court
suggested
in
the
holmberg
case
in
the
forties
that
the
rules
of
decision
act
does
not
generally
apply
to
federal
statutory
causes
of
action.
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court
has
characterized
its
statutes
of
limitations
as
substantive.
those
statutes
of
limitations
and
tolling
provisions
are
not
designed
for
procedural
fairness
as
such,
but
are
rather
designed
to
protect
states
of
mind
and
social
utility.
it
is
therefore
our
view
that
at
least
as
applied
to
these
plaintiffs
in
these
cases,
the
rules...
rule
23,
given
the
very
broad
interpretation
that
has
been
suggested,
would
violate
the
rules
enabling
act,
and
as
such
it
could
not
validly
be
applied
to
these
puerto
rico
plaintiffs.
your
honor,
if
i
may
say
a
few
more
things
in
connection
with
some
of
the
observations
that
were
made
by
the
defendants,
we
did
not
simply
wait
for
four
or
five
months
after
class
certification
was
denied
to
file
these
individual
lawsuits.
the
plaintiffs
here
moved
for
leave
to
join
as
parties
plaintiffs,
and
that
motion
was
denied,
and
the
motion
for
reconsideration
was
denied
as
well.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
am
finished.
