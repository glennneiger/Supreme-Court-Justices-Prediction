mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
nine
years
ago
this
court,
in
american
pipe
and
construction
company
versus
utah,
held
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
temporarily
suspended
in
federal
class
actions
until
the
district
court
determines
whether
to
certify
the
class.
the
issue
in
the
case
before
the
court
this
morning
is
whether
the
rule
of
american
pipe
applies
to
federal
class
actions
brought
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
we
think
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
yes.
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
held
that
it
applies,
and
only
one
court
to
our
knowledge,
and
that
is
the
court
below
in
the
instant
case,
has
held
that
it
does
not.
the
relevant
facts
are
few
and
undisputed.
the
respondents
are
teachers
in
the
department
of
education
of
puerto
rico.
during
the
1976-1977
school
year,
they
held
temporary
one-year
administrative
positions
in
the
department.
toward
the
end
of
that
year,
they
received
formal
notification
that
their
appointments
would
not
be
renewed.
approximately
one
year
later,
in
june
of
1978,
a
teacher
who
had
received
notification
of
non-reappointment,
mr.
jose
ortiz
rivera,
who
is
not
a
respondent
in
this
case,
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
in
puerto
rico
as
a
class
action
on
behalf
of
himself
and
a
class
of
persons
who
he
contended
had
been
victims
of
discrimination
on
account
of
their
political
beliefs.
relief
was
sought
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983,
and
pendent
state
claims
were
asserted.
the
defendants
were
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
it
is
undisputed
that
as
of
the
date
ortiz
rivera
filed
his
class
action,
the
statute
of
limitations
had
not
yet
run
against
the
respondents.
approximately
two
months
after
the
lawsuit
had
been
filed,
the
district
court
denied
class
certification
on
the
grounds
that
the
class
was
not
so
numerous
as
to
make
joinder
impracticable.
it
is
undisputed
that
thereafter
none
of
the
respondents
took
any
action
on
their
own
behalf
to
press
their
claims
against
the
petitioners
for
five
months,
until
january
of
1979,
when
they
brought
individual
lawsuits.
the
petitioners
filed
answers
in
each
case,
and
in
each
answer
asserted
as
an
affirmative
defense
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run.
eventually,
the
cases
were
consolidated
for
trial,
bifurcated
on
the
issue
of
liability
and
damages.
the
district
court
reserved
decision
on
the
limitations
issue.
the
cases
were
tried
in
january
of
1981,
and
verdicts
were
entered
for
the
respondents.
judgment
was
finally
entered.
on
appeal,
the
first
circuit
found
that
the
respondents'
actions
had
been
timely
filed.
although
the
court
recognized
that
if
the
rule
of
american
pipe
and
construction
company
were
applied
here,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
have
been
suspended
when
ortiz
rivera
filed
his
lawsuit,
but
that
it
would
have
resumed
running
when
class
certification
was
denied,
and
that
the
statute
would
have
expired
as
to
each
respondent
before
and
indeed
well
before
his
individual
action
was
filed.
the
court
concluded,
however,
that
it
could
not
apply
american
pipe
and
construction
company
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
board
of
regents
versus
tomanio,
and
the
court
below
specifically
held
on
the
basis
of
that
decision
that
the
rule
of
american
pipe
and
construction
does
not
apply
to
cases
brought
under
section
1983
of
title
42.
instead,
the
court
felt
constrained
to
look
to
state
law
to
find
the
tolling
rule.
even
though
when
the
court
looked
to
state
law,
or
puerto
rico
law,
it
found,
and
i
quote,
"no
discernible
state
rule"
applicable
to
class
actions,
it
fashioned
a
rule.
it
fashioned
a
rule
by
borrowing
the
aspect
of
american
pipe
and
construction
company,
that
aspect
of
the
rule
that
filing
of
a
class
suit
tolls
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
then
it
found
that
when
class
certification
was
denied,
a
puerto
rico
rule
applicable
in
other
circumstances
came
into
play.
under
that
rule,
the
entire
original
statutory
period
of
limitations
began
to
run
anew.
each
respondent
therefore
had
another
year
within
which
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
even
though
at
the
time
the
class
suit
had
been
filed
most
of
them
had
about
three
weeks
left
remaining
in
their
statutory
period.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
the
court
below,
justice
white?
it
was
that
the...
this
court's
decision
in
board
of
regents
versus
tomanio
interpreting
section
1988
mandated
state
law
and
not
federal
law
applied.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
right.
i
disagree
with
that
entirely,
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
that--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--i
agree
with
your
statement
that
the
opinion
so
reads.
i
disagree
with
the
notion
that
the
american
pipe
rule,
the
suspension
aspect
of
the
american
pipe
rule
is
in
any
way
dependent
upon
the
clayton
act.
there
are
numerous
lower
court
cases,
and
of
course
they
are
not
controlling,
but
there
are
numerous
cases
cited
in
our
brief
where
lower
courts
have
used
the
suspension
rule
in
title
7
cases,
in
various
kinds
of
cases,
securities
cases,
but
more
importantly
to
me,
at
least,
was
this
court's
decision
in
united
airlines
versus
mcdonald.
that
case
was
decided
three
and
a
half
years
after
american
pipe
and
construction
company.
in
that
case,
and
it
was
a
title
7
case,
the
eight
members
of
the
court
that
decided
that
case
all
sat
on
the
american
pipe
court,
which
was
unanimously
decided.
the
issue
in
the
united
airlines
case
was
whether
or
not
american
pipe
and
construction
company
had
any
application,
and
while
the
majority
and
the
minority
disagreed
as
to
the
scope
of
the
rule,
no
one
disputed
the
fact
that
the
rule
would
have
applicability
in
a
title
7
case,
and
indeed
the
minority
so
stated.
so,
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that
at
all.
i
think
there
is
no
limitation
there.
contrary
to
what
the
first
circuit
held,
we
believe
that
the
american
pipe
rule
controls
this
case,
that
it
is
a
uniform
rule
of
federal
procedure,
that
it
applies
generally
to
all
class
actions,
regardless
of
subject
matter
and
regardless
of
the
statute
of
limitations
that
is
applicable.
and
as
i
have
just
discussed,
i
think
that
the
clayton
act
in
no
way
gave
the
rule
its
suspension
aspect.
at
the
same
time,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
rule
is
two
rules,
as
the
respondents
contend.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
american
pipe
opinion
for
that,
in
my
judgment,
and
no
court
has
ever
held
that
this
is
actually
two
rules.
suspension
by
its
very
meaning
means
stopping
temporarily.
this
is
consistent
with
what
the
court
was
doing
in
establishing
the
rule.
it
was
protecting
the
district
court
from
a
flurry
of
activity
while
it
decided
whether
to
certify
the
class.
as
the
court
said
in
american
pipe,
rule
23
is
eviscerated
if
people
will
be
coming
in,
filing
protective
motions
to
intervene
while
the
court
is
deciding
whether
it
is
a
class
or
not.
suspension
fully
satisfies
the
needs
of
judicial
efficiency
and
economy
while
preserving
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
parties
as
of
the
date
the
class
suit
was
filed.
the
analogy
i
use
is,
it
is
snapshot.
there
is
a
snapshot
taken
at
the
date
the
lawsuit
is
filed.
the
rights
and
the
obligations
of
the
parties
are
fixed
at
that
point.
certainly
the
statute
of
limitations
is
fixed
at
that
point.
if
class
certification
is
denied,
the
statute
resumes
running.
everybody
stands
where
they
were
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed.
that
is
fair
to
both
sides.
and
at
the
same
time,
it
fosters
the
court's
and
the
defendant's
interests
in
repose.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
puerto
rico
law
in
a
different
context,
justice
stevens,
if
i
may.
the
statute
that
is
being
construed,
the
puerto
rico
statute
that
is
involved
in
section
5303
of
title
31.
that
statute
very
specifically
refers
to
the
three
methods
of
tolling
under
puerto
rico
law.
there
is
no
question
that
when
tolling
has
properly
occurred
in
puerto
rico,
that
the
statutory
period
begins
running
anew,
but
the
authorities
in
puerto
rico
law
are
absolutely
crystal
clear
that
the
tolling
in
puerto
rico
must
be
not
only
strictly
construed
by
restrictively
construed,
and
i
refer
to
the
case
of
diaz
versus...
diaz
de
deana
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
because
the
result
is
a
running
anew,
even
the
courts
of
puerto
rico
say
that
you
must
restrictively
interpret
that
rule
of
tolling.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
that's
correct.
yet
the
respondents
maintain,
as
we
just
discussed,
that
the
rule
of
american
pipe
itself
is
two
rules.
that
is,
the
federal
rule
is
two
rules,
a
general
tolling
rule
and
a
precise
tolling
effect
rule.
they
derive
that,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested,
from
the
language
in
the
last
paragraph
of
american
pipe,
where
the
court
was
saying
it
remains
to
determine
the
precise
effect
the
commencement
of
the
action
had
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
think
in
our
brief
we
make
clear
at
least
this
is
our
view
that
that
was
the
court's
recapping,
where
we
stood
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
eleven
days
left
to
run
in
the
statute.
the
motions
came
eight
days
after
class
certification
was
denied.
that
was
less
than
eleven
days,
therefore
timely
filed.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
it
was
indeed.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
well,
it
either
would
have
run
or
it
wouldn't
have
run.
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question,
justice--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--we
would
use
the
one-year
puerto
rico
statute
of
limitations,
which
we
are
in
fact
using
right
now.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
yes,
indeed.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
one
year.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
and
that
is
because
section
5303
specifically
covers
the
situation.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
i
certainly
do
say
that,
and
i
also
say
it
is
very
easy
to
say
in
this
case,
because
there
is
no
puerto
rico
law
that
covers
this
situation
as
the
first
circuit
so
said.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
they
are
indeed
two
questions.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
absolutely.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
that
is
entirely
correct.
that
is
our
position
entirely.
and
that
satisfy's
the
rule's
enabling
act
as
far
as
we
are
concerned.
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
look
at
the
reasons
why
the
respondents
have
looked
at
this
rule
of
american
pipe
as
two
rules.
they
have
carved
up
the
general
tolling
part
of
american
pipe
and
said,
we
will
take
the
benefit
of
that.
they
have
then
said,
we
will
go
to
the
puerto
rico
running
a
new
rule,
and
we
will
take
the
benefit
of
that,
and
by
the
way,
that
gives
us
a
substantive
right
to
one
year
under
puerto
rico
law,
and
the
circularity
of
this
reasoning
is
fairly
amazing,
because
now
that
they've
had
the
substantive
right
derived
from
american
pipe,
they
turn
around
and
say
american
pipe
cannot
abridge
that
right
and
therefore
violates
the
rules
enabling
act.
they
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
their
brief
that
refer
to
limitations,
that
allegedly
give
them
a
substantive
right
to
one
year's
worth
of
tolling,
where
in
fact
those
cases
talk
about
the
limitations
of
actions
being
substantive
in
puerto
rico.
that
indeed
is
why
the
tolling
statute
in
puerto
rico
is
to
be
restrictively
construed,
not
merely
strictly
construed.
in
any
case,
as
justice
rehnquist
suggests,
it
is
our
position
that
the
rule
of
american
pipe
clearly
regulates
only
procedure
in
the
federal
courts
in
class
actions.
it
preserves
the
status
quo
as
of
the
filing
of
the
class
action.
it
permits
rule
23
to
operate
as
intended.
it
is
clearly
within
the
congressional
power
delegated,
and
it
would
pass
muster
in
my
judgment
if
this
were
an
erie
case.
it
clearly
passes
muster
in
a
federal
action,
federal
question
case.
and
indeed,
tomanio
and
state
law
never
come
into
play
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
on
the
rule
of
american
pipe.
now,
if
we
turn
to
tomanio,
however,
i
don't
think
tomanio
applies.
the
case
there
is
a
wholly
different
case
from
this
case.
in
tomanio,
there
was
no
compelling
federal
reason,
there
was
no
compelling
reason
at
all
for
federal
tolling.
the
question
presented
there
was,
did
the
pendency
of
mary
tomanio's
state
claims
toll
the
running
of
the
statute
as
to
her
constitutional
claims.
new
york
law
had
no
rule,
had
no
statute.
so
the
lower
courts
fashioned
the
federal
tolling
rule
to
preserve
her
constitutional
claims,
essentially
in
furtherance
of
their
view
of
federalism.
this
court
found
the
absence
of
a
tolling
statute
in
new
york
to
mean
that
new
york
intended
no
tolling
to
occur,
and
that
therefore
the
interests
of
federalism
were
better
served
by
following
the
new
york
no
tolling
rule.
if
that
principle
were
applied
to
this
case,
there
would
be
no
tolling
at
all.
there
is
no
puerto
rico
rule.
there
is
no
puerto
rico
law
that
tolls.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
i
don't...
well,
let
me
say,
what
the
first
circuit
did
was
this,
justice
rehnquist.
they
took
the
federal
rule
of
american
pipe,
which
they
acknowledged
to
be
the
federal
rule.
the
respondents
in
this
case
acknowledged
that
to
be
the
federal
rule.
they
have
even
said
it
mandates
general
tolling.
what
the
first
circuit
said
was,
there
is
no
rule
in
puerto
rico.
i
will
therefore
fashion
a
rule.
they
fashioned
the
rule,
as
i
said
earlier.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
they
fashioned
a
rule
which
they
believed
to
be
state
law,
which
has
no
foundation
in
the
law
itself,
and
which--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--i
certainly--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--there
are
indeed
decided
cases
that
would
indicate
to
the
contrary,
which
we
have
cited
to
the
court
in
our
reply
brief.
we
certainly
understand
that
in
ordinary
circumstances,
the
court...
this
court
will
defer
to
a
circuit
court
in
its
judgment
of
what
a
state
law
may
be,
but
the
only
way
they
have
derived
the
so-called
state
law
here
is
to
say
by
analogy
the
federal
court
has
a
rule
23.
american
pipe
has
interpreted
rule
23
to
mean
this.
we
acknowledge
that
if
rule
23
and
american
pipe
apply,
the
federal
rule,
the
federal
interpretation
of
this
very
rule
23,
here
is
what
happens:
suspension,
resumption,
and
expiration.
they
then
go
and
by
analogy
move
into
rule...
the
comparable
rule
in
puerto
rico
of
procedure,
and
they
say
it
is
modeled
exactly
after
the
federal
rule,
but
we
think
that
puerto
rico
will
not
follow
the
federal
rule
even
though
it
is
patterned
after
that.
it
will
take
the
tolling
portion
of
it
and
then
apply
the
running
anew
portion.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
yes.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
well,
that's--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--absolutely.
i
think--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--i
think
what
we...
what
we
raised
in
the
questions
presented
was
whether
the
rule
of
american
pipe
and
construction
company,
which
is
a
federal
rule,
applies,
and
indeed...
anything
in
this
court's
decision
in
board
of
regents
versus
tomanio
would
preclude
application.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
that
is
certainly
correct.
it
has
been
assumed
that
that
would
be
the
law,
but
it--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
i
have
the
opinion.
if
you
will
forgive
me
for
one
moment,
i
will
look.
0....
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
well,
in
the
first
point...
in
the
first
place,
that...
the
puerto
rico
rule
of
identical
actions
does
not
cover
the
circumstance.
there
is
no
case
anywhere
that
covers
the
identical
question
that
the
first
circuit
drew
on.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
by
the
same
individual
that
refiles,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
well,
indeed,
as
we
have
cited
in
the
caguas
lumberyard
case,
there
is
authority
to
the
contrary
that
the
filing
of
a
purported
class
action
by
a
representative
of
the
class
does
not
involve
any
of
the
other
people
as
so-called
parties
to
the
action.
they
are
not
advancing
their
action
in
court
unless
those
absent
parties
come
in.
the
way
we
read
this
is,
you
can't
simply--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--well,
let
me
find
the--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--if
i
could
only
find
the
rule--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--all
right.
0....
well,
i
don't
have
the
slip
opinion,
justice
stevens.
what
i
have
is
the--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--well,
in
any
case,
it
is
absolutely
true
that
they
said
that
puerto
rico
has
no
discernible
state
rule.
that
is
no...
there
is
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
well,
they
have--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--i
agree
that
puerto
rico
has
by
judicial
decision
held
that
when
an
individual
brings
a
lawsuit
and
it
is
dismissed
for
procedural
reasons
and
he
refiles
a
lawsuit
that
is
identical
to
the
first
lawsuit,
then
he
satisfies
the
identical
requirement.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
that
is
what
the
cases
say.
now,
we
have
found
the
place
that
i
was
looking
for,
and
that
is
at
least
in
the
joint
appendix
at
the
top
of
135-a,
is
where
the
court
says,
"in
the
instant
case,
though,
there
is
no
discernible
state
rule.
"
that
is
after
the
court
has
said
that
it
feels
that
it
must
look
to
state
law
because
of
1988.
it
looks
to
section
1988
but
finds
no
discernible
state
rule
applicable
to
class
action.
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
in
the
tomanio
decision,
there
was
no
compelling
federal
reason
for
tolling,
or
for
federal
tolling.
here,
of
course,
there
is,
and
as
we
have
already
discussed,
this
is
a
class
action.
we
think
that
the
rule
23
special
rules
that
apply
there
have
to
be
given
effect.
it
is
the
federal
procedural
policy
underlying
the
rule,
efficiency
and
judicial
economy,
that
even
give
rise
to
the
tolling
here
in
the
first
place.
even
the
respondents
agree,
as
i
have
said
several
times,
that
american
pipe
mandates
general
tolling.
under
those
circumstances,
we
needn't
even
go
into
the
1988
choice
of
law
analysis,
but
as
we
have
also
argued
in
the
brief,
section
1988
provides
on
its
face
that
state
law
applies
unless
it
is
deficient.
then
you
go
to
federal
law...
i
mean,
then
you
go
to
state
law.
you
apply
federal
law.
if
it's
deficient,
you
go
to
state
law.
in
this
case,
federal
law
is
not
deficient.
american
pipe
provides
the
rule
of
decision,
and
we
think
that
a
decision
of
this
court
interpreting
a
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
has
sufficient
stature
to
qualify
for
the
federal
preference
under
section
1988.
and
as
i
have
said
further
in
discussions
with
justice
stevens,
even
if
we
go
down
to
state
law,
the
court
itself
found
at
least
in
the
tolling
aspect
no
discernible
state
rule,
and
there
is
no
doubt
about
that,
and
then
it
fashioned--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--well,
i--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--no,
i
think--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--no,
i
think
that
regardless
of
what
puerto
rico
law
provides,
that
rule
23
governs
the
tolling
here
as
a
single
rule
of
suspension
and
not
a
two-part
rule.
the
way
i
get
to
that,
justice
stevens,
is,
if
we
had
a
jurisdiction
with
a
law
that
said,
under
no
circumstances
shall
there
be
tolling
at
all,
period,
under
any
circumstance,
if
we
apply
the
two-part
test,
we
toll,
then
what
do
we
do?
we
look
to
state
law,
and
it
says
no
toll.
what
do
we
do?
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
toll,
no
toll?
well,
we've
tolled
once.
then
we
no
toll?
i
think
that
rule
23
provides
a
single
rule
of
suspension
that
is
applicable
in
federal
courts
for
all
the
reasons
that
rule
23
exists,
and
there
should
be
no
exception
for
section
1983
cases,
but
an
affirmance
of
this
case
drives
a
wedge
between
rule
23
and
civil
rights
actions
in
the
federal
courts
when
they
are
brought
certainly
as
class
actions,
but
why
not
drive
a
wedge
between
a
1983
individual
action
and
rule
3?
is
bomar
versus
keyes
in
doubt?
why
not
drive
a
wedge
between
section
1983
cases
and
rule
4?
service
of
process.
mode
of
service.
why
not
drive
it
in
between
rule
6,
computations
of
time?
or
rule
15
on
relation
back
of
amendments?
there
is
no
basis
for
that.
the
federal
courts
have
their
rules
as
housekeeping
rules
to
operate
efficiently,
to
operate
in
the
interest
of
justice,
and
for
all
of
these
reasons,
and
all
the
reasons
that
we
have
discussed,
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
mr.
chief
justice,
thank
you.
simply
two
points.
particularly
in
response
to
the
questioning
of
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor,
i
wish
certainly
to
make
clear
that
while
we
disagree
and
have
disagreed
with
the
first
circuit's
view
of
puerto
rico
law,
our
position
does
not
depend
on
a
finding
by
this
court
that
the
first
circuit
misconstrued
puerto
rico
law.
our
position
is
that
rule
23
controls
either
as
an
overriding
general
federal
rule
of
procedure
or,
if
necessary,
as
the
federal
choice
under
section
1988.
finally,
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that,
as
we
have
suggested
to
the
court,
that
there
is
a
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
rule
of
american
pipe.
its
purpose
is
to
promote
judicial
efficiency
and
economy
by
providing
not
only
that
the
running
of
the
statutes
of
limitations
be
tolled,
but
that
the
tolling
end
as
soon
as
it
has
served
its
purpose.
as
this
court
said
in
american
pipe,
this
rule
of
suspension
is
the
"rule
most
consistent
with
federal
class
action
procedure.
"
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
yes,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
i
would
certainly
say
it
selected
a
suspension
rule,
that's
correct,
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated,
and
if
that
necessarily
implies
rejecting
a
renewal
rule,
that
is
correct,
but
i
don't
know
that
we
need
reach
that.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
i
am
not
certain
i
understand
your
question,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
the
suspension
statement.
is
that
what
your
honor
means?
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
i
am
still
not
sure
i
understand
that
question.
whether
there
was
a
renewal
by
the
filing
of
the
class
action?
is
that
what
your
honor
means?
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
i
think
not.
i
think
what
the
court
was
doing
was
interposing
the
power
of
equity
to
freeze
the
rights
of
the
parties
under
the
statute
of
limitations
as
of
the
time
the
class
action
suit
was
filed
to
determine
whether
the
class
action
should
be
maintained,
and
when
it
concluded
that
it
should
not,
equity
removed
itself
from
the...
from
the
law
and
the
statute
simply
resumed
to
run.
i
don't--
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
--the
plaintiffs
in
this
case?
mr.
john
g.
de
gooyer
i
don't
quite
follow
whether
it's
dictum,
but
i
find
that
they
accepted
and
adopted
a
rule
that
found
them
timely.
yes,
that's
true,
justice
blackmun.
