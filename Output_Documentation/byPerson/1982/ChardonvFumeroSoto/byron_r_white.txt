justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
was
the
ground?
what
was
the
ground
for
rejecting
american
pipe
in
terms
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
this
hadn't
been
a
class
action?
when
the
suit
was
filed,
there
was
a
statute
of
limitations
claim
presented
by
the
defendants.
would
puerto
rico
law
have
applied
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statute
of
limitations
had
already
run?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
not
a
class
action.
it
is
just,
the
plaintiff
files
in
1983...
this
was
a
1983
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
defendant
moves
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
of
limitations
has
already
run.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
it
would
have
been...
my
question
is,
what
law
would...
what
statute
of
limitations
would
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
was
some
claim
of
tolling
in
the
case,
it
would
be
puerto
rico
law,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
for
how
long
it
would
have
tolled?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
i
understand,
but
now
you
say...
now
you
say
that
puerto
rico
law,
however,
does
not...
shouldn't
govern
because
a
class
action
is
involved
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
even
if
the
puerto
rico
law
was
just
as
clear
as
a
bell,
that
you
would...
that
american
pipe,
to
the
contrary,
american
pipe
would
still
govern.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there
was
a
puerto
rico
rule
that
said,
after
tolling,
the
period
starts
running
all
over
again,
even
if
it
was
perfectly
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
american
pipe
would
still
determine
otherwise
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reason
puerto
rico's
statute
of
limitations
is
relevant
to
this
case
at
all
is
because
of
the
absence
of
the
federal
statute
of
limitations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
one?
well,
it's
the
only...
it's
the
only
reason,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
1983
itself
contained
a
statute
of
limitations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
i
take
it
the
submission
on
the
other
side
is
that
although
there
isn't
a
federal
statute
of
limitations,
there
is
a
federal
rule
about
tolling
in
class
actions,
and
therefore,
to
that
extent,
puerto
rican
law
is
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
american
pipe
did
hold
that
in
a
class
action
the
filing
of
the
action
tolls
and
for
just
as
long...
up
until
the
time
the
class
action
is
denied,
and
time
then
begins
to
run
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
puerto
rican
law
said
that
filing
of
the
class
action
does
not
toll
anything
for
the
unnamed
members
of
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
the
first
part
of
american
pipe
doesn't
apply
here
either,
as
a
federal
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
just
with
respect
to
when
the
government
suit
was
filed,
and
then
the
court
went
on
in
the
last
paragraph
and
said
a
similar
concept.
this
is
a
court-crafted
rule
under
rule
23.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
said
a
similar
concept.
it
was
just
by
analogy
that
they
referred
to
the
clayton
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
just
chose
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
just
according
to
how
you
read
it.
it
was
still
a
court
decision
as
to
what
should
apply,
what
the
effect
of
a
class
action
should
be
under
rule
23,
and
it
looked
around
and
said,
well,
by
analogy,
a
case
is
tolled,
a
statute
is
tolled
when
the
government
files
a
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
will
just...
we
will
apply
a
similar
rule
to
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn't
mention
class
actions.
that's
the
point.
it
didn't
say
what
the
effect
of
filing
a
class
action
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
clayton
act
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
suppose...
what
would
you
say
if
rule
23
itself
said
that
when
a
class
action
is
filed,
it
shall
suspend
the
filing
of...
the
running
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
but
only
for
so
long,
but
only
up
until
the
time
the
action
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
constitutionality.
justice
byron
r.
white
validity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
rule
23
is
a
congressional
enactment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think...
you
don't...
suppose
we
read
american
pipe
as
saying
precisely
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
interpreting
rule
23
as
containing
such
a
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
a
construction--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
is
a
construction
of
some
federal
law,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
isn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
certainly
based
on
rule
23.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
however
you
put
it,
it
is
nonetheless
a
federal
law
rule
about
the
impact
of
a
class
action
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be,
but
it
still
is
a
federal
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
suppose
american
pipe
had
just
said
that
we...
in
so
many
words
that
this
is
the
impact
of
a
filing
of
a
class
action
on
the
statute
of
limitations
in
all
kinds
of
actions,
no
matter
what.
we
just
want
to
settle
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
1988
just
says,
the
federal
law
is
in
a
sense
non-existent.
you
concede
that
you
wouldn't
have
this
kind
of
an
argument
if
section...
if
rule
23
on
its
face
announced
the
american
pipe
type
of
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
then
the
federal
law
wouldn't
be
deficient
for
purposes
of
1988.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
can't
supply
the
void,
the
federal
void
for
purposes
of
1988?
