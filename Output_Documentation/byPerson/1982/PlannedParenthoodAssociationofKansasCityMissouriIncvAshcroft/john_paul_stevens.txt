mr.
susman,
where
are
the
findings
on
remand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question
before
you
go
on
to
the
second
doctor
issue?
on
the
hospital
requirement
in
the
second
trimester,
do
you
challenge
any
of
the
district
court's
finding
on
the
remand
as
clearly
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
do
you
challenge
any
of
the
district
court's
findings?
he
found,
for
example,
that
there
is
an
impairment
in
the
number
of
second
trimester
abortions
that
are
performed
in
that
period
by
reason
of
the
hospital
requirement.
should
we
take
that
as
an
established
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
urging
that
we
set
aside
the
finding
as
clearly
erroneous?
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
we
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
finding
is
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
true,
is
it
not
established
that
this
requirement
does
reduce
the
number
of
abortions
that
are
performed
during
this
period?
so
at
least,
it
establishes
some
burden
on
the
choice;
now,
whether
it's
constitutional
is
still
a
separate
inquiry.
but
must
we
not
assume
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
consequence
of
the
statute,
a
fewer
number
of
abortions
in
this
period
are
performed,
at
least
performed
lawfully.
now,
is
there--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
i'm
wondering
is
what
happens
to
these
women
who
want
abortions
during
this
period
and
are
not
going
to
hospitals
by
reason
of
the
statute;
are
they
safer
or
less
safe
by
reason
of
the
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
are
they
going
someplace
else
that
may
be
an
unlawful
choice,
or
are
they
giving
up
their
opportunity
that
they
want?
what
are
they
doing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
number
of
illnesses
or
such,
or
complications
that
were
caused
by
reason
of
second
trimester
abortions
being
performed
other
than
in
a
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ashcroft,
one
other
question.
are
there
any
other
areas
of
medical
debate
with
which
you're
familiar
where
the
state
legislature
in
missouri
has
opted
on
one
side
or
the
other
of
the
debate,
and
said
they
must
do
it
the
safer
way?
or
is
this
just
specifically
abortion-related
legislation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
any
other
counterpart
in
any
other
field
of
medicine
where
the
legislature
has
said,
for
example,
in
heart
surgery
or
something
else,
you
may
perform
one
technique
and
not
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
any
others
which
say
you
must
do
it
in
a
hospital?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
be
a
little
hard
to
enforce,
i
think.
[laughter]
and
who
would
pay
for
it?
the
reservation
of
"absent
emergency"
would
take
care
of
that
problem,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
answer
his
argument
that
the
second
doctor
provides
an
additional
protection
against
using
that
procedure
when
it
may
not
be
the
appropriate
procedure.
