mr.
frank
susman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
today
on
a
case
that
the
eighth
circuit
decided
exactly
one
year
ago
today.
restrictions
in
question
here,
like
all
legislative
abortion
restrictions,
adversely
and
disproportionately
affect
minors
and
indigent
women
who
frequently
lack
the
maturity,
education,
sophistication
and
financial
resources
to
overcome
the
additional
legislative
hurdles
placed
in
front
of
them
while
seeking
to
exercise
some
reasonable
control
over
their
reproductive
functions.
there
are
basically
only
four
of
the
restrictions
at
issue
here
today
before
this
court.
there
were
many
others
decided
by
the
district
court,
and
some
of
those
were
not
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals;
there
were
others
that
were
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
were
not
further
appealed
to
this
court.
those
four
issues
involve
minors,
the
in-hospital
provision
after
12
weeks,
the
requirement
of
two
doctors
being
in
attendance
when
an
abortion
is
performed
on
a
viable
fetus,
and
lastly,
a
requirement
that
pathology
be
done
by
a
certified
pathologist
on
all
specimens
regardless
of
the
length
of
pregnancy.
before
addressing
those
four
issues,
though,
i
would
be
remiss
if
i
did
not
respond
in
part
to
the
argument
and
to
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general,
which
brief
was
jointly
filed
in
this
case
as
well
as
in
the
akron
case,
although
his
argument
was
solely
taken
during
the
time
of
the
akron
matter.
it
seems
that
his
brief...
and
as
supported
by
his
oral
argument
and
he
so
states
on
page
3
of
that
brief...
that
the
primary
underpinning
of
his
argument
is,
and
i
quote,
"that
the
legislature
has
superior
factfinding
capabilities.
"
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
absolutely
not
true;
that
at
best,
it
is
fallacious
and
at
worst
it
is
probably
naive.
initially,
at
least
certainly
in
missouri
and
with
all
other
state
legislatures
with
which
i
am
familiar,
the
assignment
as
to
which
committee
any
particular
piece
of
legislation
goes
has
a
lot
to
do
with
whether
those
in
power
in
that
particular
legislative
body
desire
that
piece
of
legislation
to
pass
or
to
fail.
and
secondly,
the
factfinding
that
goes
on,
if
any,...
and
very
little
goes
on
in
missouri,
and
i
have
attended
many
of
these
legislative
findings
in
these
various
pieces
of
legislation,
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
the
danforth
case...
they
are
not
open
hearings,
they
are
not
hearings
that
invite
an
unbiased,
an
impartial
and
a
fair
hearing
of
evidence.
frequently,
speakers
only
on
one
side
of
the
issue
are
asked
to
attend,
and
there
certainly
is
no
great
factfinding
ability
that
would
be
superior
to
the
type
of
hearing
that
goes
on
in
court.
particularly
the
type
of
open
hearing,
unbiased
hearing,
that
went
on
in
this
case.
as
the
court
is
aware
in
this
case,
it
was
not
just
one,
but
there
were
two
district
court
trials
because
certain
issues
the
appellant
court
felt,
and
particularly
in
regard
to
the
in-hospital
issue,
had
not
been
fully
decided
as
to
the
necessary
facts
that
needed
to
be
resolved,
so
said
the
eighth
circuit,
and
so
it
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
second
trial.
in
addition,
i
would
suggest
the
bootstrap
argument
also
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
that
appears
on
page
9
of
his
brief,
that
legislatures
fully
take
into
account
all
of
the
constitutional
implications
of
those
enactments
which
they
pass
judgment
on
because
of
the
fact
that
they
all
take
an
oath
to
uphold
the
constitution,
which
we
are
here
today
discussing,
is
awesome.
mr.
frank
susman
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
susman
it
is
not
startling,
but
i
do
not
feel
that
they
accurately
do
it.
if,
in
fact,
they
did,
these
cases
would
not
be
here
today.
whether
they--
mr.
frank
susman
--yes,
you
have,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
fact
that
they
may,
even...
although
unintentionally,
not
pay
the
proper
price
for
the
constitution
is
the
reason
that
the
cases
are
brought,
and
often
successfully.
because
they
have
avoided
or
ignored
or
not
correctly
applied
that
oath
which
they
have
taken.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
i
think
he's
being
faithful
to
the
oath
if
he
intentionally
tries
to
apply
it
to
the
best
of
his
or
her
ability.
i
think
the
suggestion
of
heavy
deference
to
the
legislative
judgment
on
policy
issues,
which
is
suggested
very
strongly
by
the
solicitor
general...
and
in
those
cases
that
he
suggests
of
different
segments
of
society
have
strongly
competing
views
is
a
terrifying
thought.
the
entire
concept
of
fundamental
basic
rights
is
sought
to
be
undermined
and
discarded
in
one
fell
swoop.
constitutional
rights
will
then
be
bargained
by
lobbying
interests
in
the
legislature,
and
woe
be
it
to
the
minority
who
seek
to
rely
on
basic
equality,
justice
and
decency
for
their
protection.
a
comment
by
justice
blackmun,
as
to
whether
or
not
roe
versus
wade
or
marbury
versus
madison
was
being
sought
to
be
overruled
i
think
is
apropos.
if
one
is
to
adopt
the
suggestions
of
the
solicitor
general,
179
years
of
constitutional
history
would
appear
to
fly
out
the
door.
i
would
suggest
lastly
in
this
regard
that
the
government's
somewhat
simplistic
suggestion
of
how
to
resolve
this
matter
and
how
to
avoid
any
further
abortion
cases
coming
before
this
court
creates
more
problems
than
it
purports
to
solve.
it
basically
would
eliminate
the
entire
concept,
in
my
opinion,
of
fundamental
rights.
the
first
issue
that
i
would
wish
to
address
in
our
chapter,
in
our
section
that
was
passed,
is
the
issue
of
the
minors.
i
would
somewhat
simplify
this
particular
argument
by
noting
that
with
two
possible
exceptions,
it
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
those
two
exceptions
would
be
whether
or
not
this
act
does
require
or
insure
that
appellate
review
be
swift
and
complete.
respondents
take
the
position
that
since
this
statute
was
enjoined
the
day
following
its
enactment,
the
day
following
it
went
into
law,
since
it
has
never
been
in
practice
in
the
state
of
missouri,
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
missouri
has
waited
to
enact
any
rules
covering
appellate
review
in
these
cases.
i
don't
know
and
would
not
speak
to
the
reason
they
have
waited.
it
is
clear
that
in
the
three
years
since
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books
that
no
rules
have
been
adopted.
but
again,
in
all
candor,
the
statute
has
never
been
in
effect
to
this
date.
the
second
exception
that
i
would
raise
in
addition
to
the
statutory
construction
problem
on
this
issue
of
the
minors
is
that
the
statute
makes
absolutely
no
exceptions
whatsoever
for
any
emergency
of
any
kind,
even
when
life
or
health
is
threatened.
under
all
possible
scenarios,
it
is
necessary
that
the
minor,
if
she
cannot
obtain
the
permission
of
one
parent,
go
to
the
juvenile
court
and
go
through
this
hearing
and
any
subsequent
appeals
that
might
come
along
the
way,
and
receive
the
court's
sanction
for
this
procedure,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
her
life
or
health
is
immediately
being
threatened
by
the
fact
that
the
doctor
cannot
perform
the
abortion.
and
yet,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
section
3
of
this
same
statute
makes
an
exception
of
this
very
like
kind
when
it
is
necessary
to
perform
an
abortion
against
the
minor's
will.
it
says
if
an
abortion
is
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
the
minor,
and
she
doesn't
want
it
and
she
says
no,
then
the
doctor
may
proceed.
but
not
the
reverse.
if
she
wants
the
abortion
and
her
life
or
health
is
threatened,
he
cannot
proceed
until
he
receives,
again,
the
sanction
of
either
one
parent
or
the
court.
with
those
two
exceptions,
then,
we
are
back
to
the
statutory
construction
problem
of
section
188.028.2(4).
the
district
court
found
that
the
state
had
not
made
any
argument
to
convince
it
that
its
interpretation
of
that
statute
was
clear,
that
the
use
of
this
conjunctive
word
"or"
between
the
options
available
to
the
juvenile
court
of
a,
b
or
c,
the
court
had
the
option
to
pick
any
of
those,
and
not
necessarily
in
any
order
and
not
necessarily
by
rejecting
others
first.
the
appellate
court
disagreed.
it
came
to
an
opposite
conclusion.
we
have
suggested
in
our
reply
brief
recently
filed
with
this
court
that
in
light
of
the
difference
of
opinions
of
reasonable
judicial
minds,
that
perhaps
this
court
should
abstain
from
the
issue
inasmuch
as
a
decision
by
the
missouri
state
courts
would,
in
fact,
or
could
possibly
resolve
any
federal
constitutional
question
as
to
what,
in
fact,
the
statute
does
mean.
there
has
never
been
an
opportunity
for
the
missouri
state
courts
to
rule
on
this
issue,
and
perhaps
abstention
is
appropriate.
abstention,
in
an
identical
type
of
situation,
was
the
route
taken
by
this
court
in
1976
in
bellotti
1,
and
that
position
of
abstaining
in
that
kind
of
an
issue
was
recently
affirmed
in
h.l.
versus
matheson
in
referencing
bellotti
1.
the
second
matter
that
we
would
address
is
the
in-hospital
provision.
this
provision
probably
has
the
most
serious
impact
upon
the
actual
delivery
of
abortion
services
than
any
of
the
other
provisions
involved
before
this
court
in
this
case.
and
probably
in
the
other
cases
as
well.
it
is
clear
that
this
provision
would
stop
and
prevent
more
procedures
from
taking
place,
than
any
of
the
other
provisions
involved
or
under
review.
as
justice
rehnquist
indicated
in
the
themopolous
case,
it
is
the
practice
of
this
court
to
take
the
factual
findings
of
the
lower
courts
as
they
find
them.
this
case
is
unique
in
regard
to
the
in-hospital
provision,
as
opposed
to
any
of
the
other
district
courts
that
have
decided
this
issue,
and
there
have
been
many.
this
issue
has
been
decided
by
the
district
court
in
louisiana,
in
kentucky,
in
missouri
and
very
recently
and
unreported
yet,
in
the
last
two
weeks,
by
courts
in
illinois
and
wisconsin.
all
have
found
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
regulation.
there
were
two
separate
district
court
trials
on
this
issue,
as
i
indicated.
and
in
fact,
the
trial
on
remand,
the
second
district
court
trial,...
and
it
was
specifically
remanded
for
this
particular
issue
because
the
appellate
court
said,
we
want
to
know
specifically
whether
or
not
it
is
safer
to
perform
second
trimester
procedures
in
a
hospital
or
in
an
outpatient
facility.
and
while
the
district
court
had
held
the
section
unconstitutional,
they
had
not
in
so
many
words
made
that
factual
finding.
and
when
it
was
sent
back
on
remand
and
the
second
trial
was
held,
respondents
chose
not
to
offer
any
testimony
whatsoever.
and
the
only
additional
witnesses
at
the
trial
on
remand
were
those
offered
by
the
petitioner.
the
district
court
made
some
very
specific
findings.
these
are
all
contained
in
the
joint
appendix
and
the
various
opinions.
they
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
d&e
procedure
is
the
safest
second
trimester
abortion
technique
currently
available.
they
found
that
second
trimester
d&e
procedures
are
currently
performed
in
only
one
hospital
in
the
entire
state
of
missouri,
that
being
in
kansas
city,
missouri
which
is
on
the
western
border.
mr.
frank
susman
these
are
all
in
the
joint
appendix
on
pages
12
through
14...
actually,
12
through
14,
and
then
the
same
findings
by
the
appellate
court,
or
additional
findings,
are
found
on
the
cross-petition
at
a61
and
a116.
the
district
court
went
on
to
find
that
in
the
last
final
year,
when
only
hospitals
could
perform
abortions
in
missouri...
that
being
1979...
that
540
second
trimester
d&e
procedures
were
performed.
the
district
court
ruled
on
this
issue
in
january
of
1980
and
so
it's
fair
to
compare
the
year
of
1980,
if
you
want
to
count
it
as
a
whole
year,
in
which
procedures
were
available
both
in
the
hospital
and
both
outpatient.
the
court
found,
as
opposed
to
the
540
performed
in
a
hospital
when
it
could
only
be
performed
in
a
hospital
in
1979,
that
in
1980
there
were
some
1400
second
trimester
procedures,
700
of
which
were
performed
in
hospitals
and
690
in
outpatient
facilities.
and
so
what
is
clear
is
when
the
outpatient
facilities
began
to
do
them,
they
did
not
draw
from
the
patient
population
of
the
hospitals
who
had
been
doing
them
previously.
what
they
did,
in
fact,
was
merely
help
to
fill
a
certain
portion
of
the
unmet
need
for
second
trimester
procedures.
they
were
not
taking
patients
from
the
hospitals.
in
fact,
as
dr.
henshaw
testified,
who
is
a
national
expert
on
the
issue
of
these
types
of
statistics,
that
missouri
in
1979,
again
with
only
hospitals
to
perform
these
procedures,
was
only
meeting
13
percent
of
the
unmet
need
for
second
trimester
procedures.
and
in
1980,
when
both
hospitals
and
outpatient
facilities
could
perform
them,
the
unmet
need
went
from
13
percent
of
the
met
need
up
to
34
percent;
still
leaving
some
66
percent
of
the
second
trimester
need
unmet
in
missouri.
the
court
also
found
that
there
was
substantial
interference.
it
certainly
was
much
more
expensive,
that
they
were
not
readily
available
by
reason
of
one
hospital
in
the
entire
state
being
on
the
western
border,
and
in
missouri
the
other
major
metropolitan
area,
st.
louis,
is
on
the
eastern
border
of
the
state.
the
appellate
court
found
additional
findings
to
the
district
court.
they
found,
as
was
argued,
that
when
roe
was
decided
in
1973,
a
d&e
procedure
was
virtually
unknown
in
the
united
states.
they
also
found
it
was
the
safest
procedure
known,
and
they
also
made
the
specific
finding
that
non-hospital
second
trimester
d&e
procedures
are
no
more
dangerous
to
maternal
health
than
hospitalized
procedure.
mr.
frank
susman
it
was
true
throughout
the
period
that
they
were
presently
being
performed
in
missouri
and
by
the
physicians
who
were
the
experts
testifying.
mr.
frank
susman
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
probably
not
true.
but
i
think
in
conjunction
with
that
we
have
to
realize
of
what
percentage
of
procedures
we
are
talking
about
that
are
done
beyond
18
weeks.
98
percent
of
all
abortion
procedures
are
conducted
prior
to
the
18th
week.
mr.
frank
susman
because
first
of
all,
all
second
trimester
procedures
were
not
really
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
evidence
only
went
to
the
method
of
d&e,
and
the
other
methods,
the
installation
methods,
whether
they
be
saline,
prostaglandin,
urea
or
a
combination
of
many
other
types
of
chemicals
were
not
in
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
susman
correct.
as
to
whether--
mr.
frank
susman
--then
if
it
does
not
eliminate
that
period
of
time
when
it
is
not
safer,
then
it
has
not
been
narrowly
tailored.
mr.
frank
susman
i'm
not
sure
but
this
requirement
is,
in
fact,
invalid
on
its
face.
i
think
one
has
to
have
factual
evidence
on
this
particular
type
of
requirement.
i
think
the
requirement
itself
on
its
face,
in
fact,
is
very
beguiling
and
very
deceptive.
and
only
when
one
hears
the
evidence
and
listens
to
the
physicians
who
perform
the
procedures,
and
looks
at
the
statistics,
then
can
one
look
past
the
beguiling
nature
of
the
statute
on
its
face
and
see
that,
in
fact,
it
does
not
bear
out
that,
in
fact,
it
is
not
safer.
mr.
frank
susman
yes.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
there
was
no
evidence
discussing
the
higher
range
of
the
second
trimester.
mr.
frank
susman
theoretically,
it
would
even
be
past--
mr.
frank
susman
--it
discussed...
the
experts
who
testified,
and
the
statistics,
mainly
went
through
18
weeks.
mr.
frank
susman
the
district
court
found
through
the
18th
week.
it
makes
a
reference
in
a
footnote,
to
the
18th
week
of
pregnancy.
mr.
frank
susman
judge
elmo
hunter,
now
senior
status.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
your
honor,
although
that's
not
a
complete
answer.
we
have
an
ambulatory
surgical
licensing
law
that
licenses
certain
ambulatory
surgical
centers
as
opposed
to
hospitals.
those
would
be
the
only
two
classes
of
institutions
licensed
by
the
state;
hospitals
and
ambulatory
surgical
centers.
but
the
definition
of
what
is
an
ambulatory
surgical
licensing
center
and,
therefore,
deciding
whether
or
not
you
have
to
apply,
does
not
cover
abortion
facilities,
and
there
is
not
a
single
abortion
facility
in
the
state
that
is
licensed
as
an
outpatient
surgical
center.
mr.
frank
susman
no,
your
honor.
but
it
has
to
do
with
certain
portions
of
the
definition
of
what
is
such
a
facility,
and
abortion
facilities
do
not
fit
into
the
definition.
for
example,
two
of
the
parts
that
i
recall
offhand,
one
says
that
you
must
have,
to
be
in
the
definition,
a
permanent
staff
of
physicians.
many
abortion
facilities--
mr.
frank
susman
--it
just
says
a
permanent
staff.
and
secondly,
it
also
as
part
of
the
essential
definition
says
that
there
must
be
a
physician
present
on
the
site
at
any
time
that
a
patient
is
present.
mr.
frank
susman
abso...
well,
that's
what
the
definition
says,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
susman
both
of
these
clinics
are
not-for-profit
agencies,
tax
exempt
under
the
irs.
mr.
frank
susman
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
been
licensed,
but
the
statute
clearly
does
not
require
it,
no
one
has
ever
suggested
it.
in
fact,
that's
not
true
that
it
hasn't
been
suggested.
letters
have
been
written
to
the
state
by
other
people
suggesting
that
these
places
have
to
have
licenses,
and
the
state
has
never
taken
any
action
in
that
regard,
and
the
clinics
do
not
feel
they
have
to
comply.
i
would
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
clinic
for
reproductive
health
services,
which
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here,
is
licensed,
in
fact,
by
the
city
of
st.
louis.
not
a
state
license,
but
the
city
of
st.
louis
issued
it
a
license.
mr.
frank
susman
dr.
schmidt.
mr.
frank
susman
well,
curiously
enough,
that
same
dr.
schmidt
testified
in
this
case.
now,
of
course,
his
testimony
came
prior
to
the
change
in
the
acog
standard.
but
in
our
case,
he
says...
and
this
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
154...
on
cross
examination
he
admits
that
doing
these
procedures
outpatient
is
acceptable
if
it
works
all
right.
you
know,
the
proof
is
in
the
pudding.
he
might
not
be
comfortable
doing
them,
and
he
doesn't
do
abortions,
if
people
are
doing
them
and
the
bottom
line
is
that
they
work
all
right,
then
it's
acceptable.
and
he
was
then
asked
the
follow-up
question
of
whether
he
knew
of
any
untoward
effects
and
wasn't
it
working
all
right,
and
he
said
yes,
it
was.
i'll
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
frank
susman
first
of
all,
justice
rehnquist,
if
i
might
perhaps
clear
up
some
confusion.
in
the
danforth
statute,
which
was
adopted
in
1974
following
roe
versus
wade,
there
was
a
specific
provision
identical
to
the
one
under
challenge
here
that
said
all
abortions
after
12
weeks
must
be
in
a
hospital.
so
they
were
prohibited
by
law
from
'74
up
to
'79
when
that
same
statute
was
put
into
a
different
chapter
and
just
re-enacted.
so
you
had
a
clear
period
of
from
1973
to
1980
when
all
second
trimester
procedures
statutorily
had
to
be
done
in
a
hospital.
mr.
frank
susman
i
do.
mr.
frank
susman
be
more
than
happy
to.
many
states
adopted
this
kind
of
provision
immediately
following
73
as
the
first
type
of
legislative
response
to
roe
versus
wade.
there
were
no
challenges
anywhere
to
my
knowledge
against
this
type
of
provision
in
those
early
years.
it
was
only
after
medical
advances
and
times
changed.
and
the
changes
that
occurred
were
the
following.
one,
d&e,
which
was
virtually
unknown
in
this
country
in
1973,
became
the
most
prevalent
second
trimester
procedure
in
the
united
states
over
a
period
of
years.
secondly,
the
second
underpinning
of
this
court
in
roe
versus
wade
in
the
dicta
referring
to
hospitals,
was
a
reference
to
the
american
public
health
association's
policy
of
saying
do
them
in
a
hospital.
the
american
public
health
association
changed
their
policy.
planned
parenthood
federation
changed
their
policy.
the
american
college
of
<obgyns>
[=ob-gyns]
changed
their
policy.
and
for
the
first
time,
people
thought,
when
they
were
beginning
to
do
these
things
and
they
were
being
done
successfully
in
those
states
which
had
not
enacted
this
type
of
restriction,
that
those
states
that
had
it
should
be
challenged.
mr.
frank
susman
no.
but
in
fact,
this
court
refers
in
a
footnote
to
relying
upon
the
apha's
standard
of
saying
that
it
should
be
done
in
a
hospital.
and
that
standard
changed.
in
reference
to
the
second
doctor
requirement,
i
think
we
must
note
that
the
state
was
witness
for
the
petitioner,
it's
true,
but
it
was
the
state's
statistician
who,
by
law,
keeps
track
of
all
the
abortion
procedures
done
in
missouri,
that
the
only
form
of
second
trimester
abortion
in
missouri
is
the
method
of
d&e.
and
every
witness,
including
those
for
the
respondents,
agreed
unanimously
and
without
exception
that
there
is
no
chance
of
survival
of
a
fetus
when
one
performs
a
d&e
procedure.
and
therefore,
it
is
totally
irrational
to
require
a
second
physician
to
be
in
attendance
when
no
one
indicated
that
there
was
any
possibility
of
survival.
there
are
no
other
types
of
procedures
done
in
missouri.
at
least,
none
had
been
done
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
frank
susman
that
second
physician,
while
they
might
have
some
idle
conversation,
has
no
direct
say
in
that
decision.
they
are
not
the
surgeon.
and
in
fact,
it
is
standard
policy,
and
there
was
evidence
at
the
trial
to
this
effect,
that
when
you
have
a
second
physician
present,
such
as
at
a
large
university
medical
setting
and
you
have
a
premature
delivery,
that
the
second
patient,
the
child,
once
it
is
born,
does
not
become
the
patient
of
the
neonatologist
whom
you
have
standing
by
until
such
time
as
that
delivering
physician,
the
obstetrician,
chooses
to
turn
that
child
over
to
the
neonatologist.
it
is
his
decision
when
that
turning
over
of
that
second
patient
who
has
come
into
existence
occurs.
he
must
turn
the
patient
over.
merely
being
there
accomplishes
nothing,
particularly
when
in
fact,
no
procedure
is
being
done
in
missouri
that
would
permit
such
a
survival.
we
think
the
analogy
to
the
prohibition
in
the
danforth
case
of
the
saline
procedure
is
identical.
the
court
in
that
case
held...
and
all
of
this
language
is
totally
analogous
here.
you
said
in
1976
the
state
would
prohibit
the
use
of
a
method
which
the
record
shows
is
the
most
commonly
used
nationally
by
physicians
after
the
first
trimester,
and
which
is
safer
with
respect
to
maternal
mortality
than
even
continuation
of
the
pregnancy
until
normal
childbirth.
and
the
latest
study,
which
appears
in
the
july
issue
of
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association
by
dr.
cates
indicates
that
abortion
is
now
as
safe
as
childbirth
up
to
the
16th
week.
and
moreover,
you
went
on
to
say
as
a
practical
matter,
it
forces
a
woman
and
her
physician
to
terminate
a
pregnancy
by
methods
more
dangerous
to
her
health
than
the
method
outlawed.
everything
you
said
then
in
danforth
is
equally
applicable
to
the
provision
under
consideration
here.
the
second
doctor
requirement
i
think
i
have
discussed.
i
would
only
refer
this
court
back
to
its
language
of
collati
in
1979,
in
which
you
said
that
roe
stressed
repeatedly
the
central
role
of
the
physician,
both
in
consulting
with
the
woman
about
whether
or
not
to
have
an
abortion,
and
in
determining
how
any
abortion
was
to
be
carried
out.
this
standard
over
the
past
10
years
has
proven
itself,
i
suggest,
in
exemplary
fashion.
the
medical
community
has
distinguished
itself
by
providing
abortion
services
in
a
safe
and
disciplined
manner.
i
would
disagree
with
my
brother
here
that
there
is
some
great
medical
debate
being
waged
either
in
the
literature
or
in
the
public
forums
of
this
country
over
whether
or
not
it
is
safe
to
do
abortions
outpatient.
there
is
nothing
in
the
literature
to
substantiate
any
such
debate.
certainly,
they
had
medical
experts
at
the
trial;
medical
experts
who
all
were
morally
opposed
to
abortion,
who
had
never
performed
an
abortion.
now,
we've
already
discussed
with
dr.
schmidt,
a
past
president
of
acog
testified
in
our
trial
who
also
testified
in
akron.
and
the
only
medical
expert
they
had
who
had
experience
doing
abortions
and
called
by
them,
dr.
nathanson,
dr.
nathanson
says
it's
just
as
safe
out
of
the
hospital
as
it
is
in.
and
he
is
the
only
expert
they
had
who
had
ever
done
abortions.
abortion
today
is
the
most
widely-publicized
and
scrutinized
medical
procedure
because
of
all
the
legal
implications,
but
the
delivery
of
abortion
health
care
in
this
country
has
not
been
found
wanting
to
any
degree.
excessive
legislation
in
this
field
can
only
produce
the
very
untoward
medical
and
health
consequences
that
the
respondents
would
suggest
to
you
they're
trying
to
prevent.
but
instead,
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
real
purpose
of
all
of
these
statutes
and
of
all
of
these
sections
is
to
thwart
the
free
exercise
of
the
right.
it
is
the
very
essence
of
medicine
that
the
physician
be
able
to
adjust
the
course
and
consequences
of
treatment
to
the
individual
patient.
codifying
medicine
is
the
very
antithesis
of
the
medical
arts.
women
have
more
rights
in
the
third
trimester
after
viability,
for
reasons
of
life
or
health,
than
they
have
under
section
188.028
for
minors
when
even
if
you're
dying,
you
still
have
to
go
to
court
or
get
a
parent,
and
there's
no
exceptions,
or
you
have
in
hospital.
there
is
no
emergency
exception
whatsoever
in
the
in-hospital
requirement,
either.
no
exception.
you're
better
off
being
in
the
third
trimester;
at
least
then
you
have
some
hope.
thank
you.
