hear
arguments
next
in
planned
parenthood
association
of
kansas
city,
missouri
against
john
ashcroft,
attorney
general
of
missouri,
and
the
related
case.
mr.
susman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we've
said
that
in
a
number
of
our
opinions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
that
so
startling
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
one
of
these
generalizations
which
has
the
value
of
many
generalizations.
but
we
have
said
as
much
in
a
number
of
our
opinions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
prior
case
there
was
testimony
referred
to
by
the
president
or
past
president
of
the
american
college
of
obstetricians--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--that
all
second
trimester
procedures
should
be
in
a
hospital.
was
there
any
such
testimony
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ashcroft,
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
it
be
possible
that
one
explanation
might
be
that
they
went
elsewhere
into
another
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
statistic
is
not
too
reliable?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
normally,
on
your
statement
of
the
standard,
we
would
normally
then
accept
that
finding.
is
that
not
so?
well,
you
would
say
that
even
if
we
judge
the
case
on
that
basis,
you
should
win.
that's
your
submission.
even
if
the
number
of
abortions
weren't
what
they
would
have
been
without
the
hospitalization
requirement.
you
say
that
you're
entitled
to
impose
the--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
legislature
of
a
state
constitutionally
require
that
all
childbirths
take
place
in
a
hospital,
absent
an
emergency?
chief
justice

mr.
susman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
