is
that
true
throughout
the
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
is
it
true
about...
the
relative
safety...
is
it
true
throughout
the
second
trimester?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
evidence
showed
that
this
relative
safety
was
true
only
up
to
the
16th
week,
for
example,
the
statute
arguably
might
be
unconstitutional,
to
that
extent.
but
why
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
question
is
whether
hospitalization
is
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
throughout
the
period,
throughout
the
second
trimester.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
is
it
invalid
on
its
face?
this
isn't
a
first
amendment
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
talking
about
the
evidence
that
was
submitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
evidence
did
not
suggest
that
aborting
throughout
the
second
trimester
was
as
safe
as
childbirth.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
it
discuss?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
discuss?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
well,
what
was
the
period
during
which
the
testimony
indicated
that
aborting
was
as
safe
as
childbirth?
for
what
limits?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
found
that...
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
it...
said
it
was
supported
by
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
you
heard
some
questions
in
the
previous
case
about
legislative
history
and
whatnot.
is
there
any
legislative
history
underlying
this
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
keep
no
record
of
hearings?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
legislative
findings
that
precede
this
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
district
court
found
18
weeks.
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
office
would
so
recommend.
