mr.
john
ashcroft
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
balancing
of
rights
reached
by
this
court
in
roe
versus
wade
included
an
explicit
recognition
of
compelling
state
interests
which
justify,
if
not
require,
state
regulation
of
abortions
to
protect
the
individual
health
and
safety
of
citizens.
no
state
can
properly
ignore
this
responsibility;
indeed,
the
state
of
missouri
has
not.
in
the
spring
of
1979
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people,
together
with
the
people
themselves,
wrestled
with
the
concept
of
the
proper
role
for
the
state
of
missouri
in
regulation
abortions,
consistent
with...
consistently
with
constitutional
imperatives.
after
hearings
and
testimony
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature
and
debate
in
both
chambers
of
the
legislature,
along
with
substantial
public
discussion,
the
state
of
missouri
forged
a
comprehensive
program
meeting
its
responsibility
to
safeguard
the
well-being
of
our
citizens,
and
a
program
which
would
be
subject
to
change
by
the
legislature
in
the
light
of
adjusting
factors
that
they
felt
were
necessary.
four
crucial
elements
of
the
state's
comprehensive
program
in
relation
to
that
abortion
regulation
framework
are
before
the
court
today;
the
second
trimester
hospitalization
requirement,
the
second
doctor
requirement
for
abortions
of
viable,
unborn
children,
the
consent
provision
for
minors,
a
pathology
requirement,
and
these
are
to
be
considered
in
this
proceeding.
the
proceedings
before
the
trial
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
were
basically
a
legislative
process
assessing
the
wisdom
of
the
missouri
enactments.
it's
clear,
inasmuch
as
the
enactments
have
never
been
in
place,
they
were
enjoined,
all
of
the
sections
that
were
challenged
were
enjoined
within
24
hours
after
they
went
into
effect.
the
trial
objections
made
by
the
state
relating
to
standing
and
ripeness
were
brushed
aside
as
the
district
court
plunged
headlong
into
its
assessment
of
expert
witnesses.
so
this
is
a
case
where
we
are
assessing
an
uninterpreted,
unenforced
statute,
but
a
statute
which
is
alleged
to
be
one
which
is
infirm
and
unconstitutional.
as
a
result
of
both
the
trial
and
appeal
of
this
case
centered
on
policy-related
testimony
regarding
what
can
best
be
characterized
as
a
significant
debate
within
the
medical
profession.
this
effort
really
replicated
what
a
legislative
process
should
be.
the
legislature
had
drawn
conclusions
about
that
debate
when
it
enacted
the
statutes
earlier.
of
the
four
abortion
matters
raised
in
this
court,
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
substantially
agreed
with
the
legislative
judgment
of
the
missouri
legislature
on
the
consent
issue
relating
to
minors,
and
overruled
the
missouri
legislature
on
the
other
issues,
the
issues
of
a
second
trimester
hospitalization,
a
second
doctor
in
the
event
of
the
abortion
of
a
viable,
unborn
child,
and
a
requirement
for
pathology.
the
requirement
for
hospitalization
for
abortion
procedures
conducted
after
the
12th
week
of
pregnancy
was
ruled
unconstitutional
below.
and
i
believe
that
the
district
court
and
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
erred
in
so
doing.
the
basic
premise
i
believe
that
we
can
understand
from
roe
versus
wade
is
a
premise
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
guarding
and
protecting
the
health
of
individuals;
and
secondly,
that
the
state
can
regulate
to
protect
that
interest.
i
think
given
that
interest
and
the
ability
of
the
state
to
regulate,
most
states
would
accept
that
responsibility
and
so
do.
the
problem
that
we
see
is
that
regulation
is
impossible
if
this
court
is
to
retreat
from
the
bright
line
drawn
in
roe
where
it
divided
the
time
of
a
pregnancy
into
areas
when
the
state
could
exercise
its
judgment.
if,
indeed,
the
courts
are
to
pursue
the
latest
statement
of
the
medical
society
or
even
a
vocal
minority
of
individuals
in
the
medical
community,
to
change
what
is
allowable
in
terms
of
state
statutes,
i
think
we'll
find
states
in
an
impossible
position;
not
only
impossible
in
terms
of
ever
making
judgments
which
can
withstand
tests,
but
we'll
be
finding
ourselves
here
over
and
over
again
relitigating
issues
over
and
over.
roe
clearly
set
forth
some
guidelines,
and
i
urge
this
court
not
to
retreat
from
its
indication
that
there
are
certain
specific
times
in
which
the
state
should
be
able
to
rationally
regulate
in
relation
to
the
compelling
interests
of
the
state.
i
believe
that
there
is
clear
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
the
state
can
rationally
conclude
that
the
facilities
available
in
hospitals
are
reasonably
related
to
the
objective
of
the
preservation
and
protection
of
maternal
health.
i
believe
that
the
record
in
this
case
supports
the
concept
that
the
state
can
rationally
conclude
that
a
second
doctor
at
the
abortion
of
a
viable,
unborn
child
is
rationally
related
to
the
state's
separate
and
distinct
interest
in
the
potential
life
of
that
child.
these
are
concepts
which
are--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--we
believe
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
testimony
that
indicates
that
medical
debate
is
going
on
here
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
as
safe
or
safer
to
require
these
in
the
hospital.
mr.
john
ashcroft
the
finding
is
an
established
fact.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
conclusive
evidence
to
that
regard
in
the
record.
mr.
john
ashcroft
no.
mr.
john
ashcroft
even
if
you
find
that
the
finding
is
correct,
i
am
urging
this
court
to--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--the
state
of
missouri
is
willing
to
concede
that
the
choice
for
an
abortion
in
a
hospital
is
more
difficult
than
the
choice
in
a
clinic
facility.
mr.
john
ashcroft
the
state
is
unwilling
to
concede
that.
while
it
may
be
more
difficult
to
reach
the
decision,
the
state
isn't
in
a
position
to
say
that
that
decision
still
will
not
be
reached.
it
may
not
provide
a
threshold
which
is
so
significant
as
to
impair
anyone's
real
willingness
to
reach
the
decision.
mr.
john
ashcroft
are
they
safer
by
not
going
to
the
hospital
or
less
safe
than--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
case
to
indicate
that
the
women
are
going
to
unlawful
sources
for
abortion.
mr.
john
ashcroft
the
district
court--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--i
think
the
district
court
looked
to
a
time
in
missouri
when
hospitalization
was
required.
that
was
preceding
this
statute.
we
had
another
statute
passed
earlier
which
required
hospitalization.
now,
that
was
not
challenged
at
the
time
it
was
in
effect,
and
it
was
when
this
statute
would
go
into
effect
that
the
challenge
took
place,
and
the
suspension
of...
and
the
availability
of
abortions
in
clinics--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--it
was
based
upon
information
from
a
time
period
when
this
statute
was
not
in
effect,
and
that's
why
the
state
is
reluctant
to
agree
with
the
conclusion
in
that
matter.
mr.
john
ashcroft
it
is
possible.
both
of
the
major
metropolitan
areas
in
missouri
are
located
on
the
border
of
the
state;
either
in
st.
louis
or
kansas
city,
and
there
is
quite
an
exchange
of
clientele.
mr.
john
ashcroft
they
might
go
into
illinois
somewhere.
in
kansas
city,
they
might--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
ashcroft
i
am
suggesting
that
it's
not
an
inevitable
statistic.
i
can
understand
that
the
court
may
have--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--that's
correct.
i
believe
that
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
it.
i
disagree
that
it's
a
conclusion
that
you
have
to
reach.
i
believe--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--yes.
my
view
is
that
there's
a
substantial
compelling
interest
that
exists
already
in
the
state
for
maternal
health.
and
we
have
come...
the
legislature
has
concluded
that
that
interest
is
furthered
and
is
reasonably
related
to
the
hospitalization
requirement;
that
the
imposition
of
that
hospitalization
requirement
is
justified
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
ashcroft
there
is
some
evidence
about
complications
and
deaths
outside
of
hospitals,
but
basically,
this
evidence
which
was
in
the
case
took
place
prior
to
the
suspension
of
the
law,
during
a
period
of
time
when
second
trimester
abortions
were
required
to
be
in
hospitals
in
the
state
of
missouri.
i
think
dr.
willard
cates
of
the
center
for
disease
control
in
atlanta
testified
that
of
the
18
deaths
that
he
had
examined,
11
of
them
had
been
clinic
settings
and
7
of
them
from
hospital
settings,
relating
to
those
deaths
in
those
abortion
cases.
mr.
john
ashcroft
missouri
does
not
record...
other
than
the
fact
that
hearings
may
have
been
held
and
the
like...
that
there
is--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--that's
correct.
there
is,
to
my
knowledge,
no
verbatim
account
of
what
was
said
or--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--not
to
my
knowledge.
it
is
argued
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
change
in
technology
that
has
resulted
in
the
concept
of
hospitalization
for
second
trimester
abortions
being
outdated.
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
record
in
the
case
and
to
analyze
the
testimony
presented.
there
was
an
overwhelming
consensus
among
the
medical
experts
at
trial
that
the
vast
majority
of
abortions
in
post
12-week
pregnancies
belonged
in
the
hospital.
some
of
the
record
is
confusing
because
the
center
for
disease
control
statistics
reflect
what
are
known
as
weeks
of
gestation
rather
than
weeks
of
pregnancy.
weeks
of
gestation
are
counted
from
the
last
menstrual
period,
and
according
to
dr.
cates,
who
is
the
chief
of
abortion
surveillance
there,
you
have
to
subtract
two
weeks
from
any
of
their
statistics
in
order
to
find
out
what
the
real
impact
is
on
weeks
of
pregnancy.
the
only
disputed
area
really
is
early
trimester
d&e
abortions.
there
is
a
dispute
in
the
medical
community
and
a
debate
which
indicates
that
up
to
15,
16,
some
say
up
to
18
weeks
of
gestational
age,
those
can
be
done
safely
in
a
clinic
setting.
mr.
john
ashcroft
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
ashcroft
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
to
any
willingness
to
differentiate
between
the
weeks
of
gestation
statistics,
which
were
supplied
over
and
over
again,
and
the
missouri
statute's
requirement
for
weeks
of
pregnancy.
now,
dr.
cates
of
the
center
for
disease
control,
who
was
the
most
experienced
of
the
witnesses
testifying
in
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs,
indicated
that
at
the
end
of
the
15th
week,
which
would
be
the
end
of
the
13
week
in
pregnancy
terms
rather
than
gestational
terms,
that
hospitalization
would
be
appropriate.
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
in
those
kinds
of
circumstances
when
you
put
him
in
conjunction
with
the
expert
witnesses
of
the
state,
is
an
overlap
perhaps
of
about
seven
days.
it's
important
also
to
note
some
other
things.
of
the
45
percent
of
the
death
cases
that
dr.
cates
investigated,
indicated
that
the
physician
had
made
a
mistake
of
at
least
four
weeks
in
judging
the
fetal
age
before
performing
the
abortion.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
center
for
disease
control
statistics
are
all
arrived
at
after
the
fact
of
the
abortion
through
post-abortion
techniques.
i
don't
think
it's
unreasonable
at
all,
if
we're
talking
about
an
aperture
of
seven
to
maybe
14
days
early
in
the
second
trimester,
to
give
the
state
the
right
to
demand
a
margin
of
safety
inasmuch
as
doctors
who
are
making
the
evaluations
about
whether
or
not
they're
to
conduct
the
abortion
in
a
hospital
or
not
are
frequently
involved
in
having
difficulty
estimating
the
fetal
age
in
the
pre-abortion
context.
after
the
abortion,
it's
clear
that
the
fetal
age
is
easier
to
estimate,
but
that
certainly
doesn't
leave
us
with
much
leeway
or
much
protection.
i
think
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
there
is
a
medical
debate
about
a
small
fragment
of
second
trimester
abortions.
that
medical
debate
relates
to
early
d&e
procedures.
some
would
say
that
those
go
to
the
end
of
the
15th
week
of
gestation
or
the
end
of
the
13th
week
of
pregnancy,
as
dr.
willard
cates
does,
or
some
would
carry
it
as
far
as
the
district
court
found.
in
the
situation
where
there
is
a
medical
debate
that
rages,
and
there
are
significant
medical
experts
and
credible
individuals
who
will
testify
that
they
all
belong
in
a
hospital
in
the
second
trimester,
and
there
is
a
debate
relating
to
just
a
small
aperture
and
just
a
narrow
portion
of
procedures,
i
think
the
state
ought
to
have
the
ability
to
opt
as
a
policy
to
require
second
trimester
hospitalization.
and
i
do
not
believe
the
technology
has
advanced
to
such
a
degree
in
relation
to
this
matter
as
to
take
us
away
from
the
ability
of
the
state
in
scoring
this
debate
to
err
on
the
side
of
safety,
if
you
will,
and
require
its
citizens
who
choose
to
have
abortions
in
the
second
trimester
to
have
them
in
a
hospital
setting.
mr.
john
ashcroft
well
certainly,
this
enactment
is
abortion
related.
but--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--i
don't
know
in
reference
to
a
specific
technique.
now
we
have,
of
course,
a
lot
of
statutes
relating
to
health
care,
the
hospitals,
what
standards
they
have
to
meet
and
those
kinds
of
things
which--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--i
don't
have
an
awareness
of
any
other
statute
requiring
that
a
particular
surgical
procedure
must
be
in
a
hospital.
mr.
john
ashcroft
that's
correct.
mr.
john
ashcroft
that's
correct,
and
it
was
not
allowed
and
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
court.
mr.
john
ashcroft
i
believe
that
it
could.
a
second--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--that
would
be
my
understanding.
mr.
john
ashcroft
no,
i
don't
think
it
would,
and
i
don't
think
the
lack
of
money
would
really
prevent
that--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--we've
made
provision
in
missouri
for
individuals
who
seek...
are
having
children
who
don't
have
the
resources
to
afford
the
hospital
setting
to
be
provided
for
in
the
hospital.
the
second
point
that
i'd
like
to
make
is
to
address
the
issue
of
the
need
for
a
second
doctor
in
the
operating
room,
or
in
attendance
i
would
say
more
specifically
at
the
time
an
abortion
is
performed
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
viable,
unborn
child.
this
is
really
related
to
the
third
trimester
of
a
proceeding.
viability,
according
to
the
medical
experts
who
testified
at
trial,
only
occurs
in
the
third
trimester.
the
earliest
solid
testimony
in
the
record
indicates
that
24
weeks;
the
consensus
i
believe
would
place
viability
at
26
weeks.
roe
v.
wade
indicated
that
there
are,
indeed,
separate
and
distinct
interests
in
the
state
in
the
potential
of
life,
and
that
interest
can
be
protected
reasonably.
it's
my
view
that
the
state
of
missouri
has
harmonized
in
a
significant
way
the
interests
of
the
mother
and
the
interests
of
the
unborn
potential
life
in
its
statute.
and
i
think
it's
done
so
quite
well.
i
should
add
that
in
the
third
trimester,
the
law,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
is
no
right
to
an
abortion
except
when
the
woman's
health
is
endangered,
and
therefore,
we
are
not
talking
about
the
same
kind
of
right
relating
to
the
woman
in
the
third
trimester
that
we
are
in
the
second
and
first
trimester.
we
have
two
sets
of
rights
then
that
are
to
be
guarded
by
the
state
and
two
interests
that
are
present.
the
maternal
health
interests,
and
the
interests
in
the
state
in
the
potential
life.
there
is
significant
testimony
in
the
record,
particularly
the
testimony
of
dr.
elizabeth
james
who
was
the
director
of
neonatal
intensive
care,
a
unit
at
the
university
of
missouri
medical
center,
that
indicates
that
children
who
leave
the
environment
of
the
mother
at
26
weeks
now
have
a
50
percent
chance
of
survival.
at
28
weeks,
the
record
in
the
medical
center
is
a
75
percent
chance
of
survival.
she
provided
testimony
indicating
that
she
thought
it
was
necessary
that
a
second
individual
be
in
attendance
at
the
time,
and
that
that
second
individual
could
be
crucial
in
a
couple
of
ways.
first
of
all,
the
most
important
thing
for
a
premature
child,
a
newborn,
at
that
stage
of
development
is
that
they
begin
to
respirate,
and
the
ability
to
get
respiration
going
is
a
job
which
requires
the
attendance
of
a
physician.
secondly,
circulation,
and
she
indicated
that
heart
massage
may
be
necessary.
she
pointed
to
the
fact
that
this
is
crucial
that
it
be
done
expeditiously
because
a
failure
to
respirate
can
result
in
neurological
damage,
so
that
while
a
child
might
survive,
it
might
not
survive
with
the
same
quality
that
it
would
otherwise
have.
given
the
fact
that
roe
v.
wade
talked
about
the
potential
for
meaningful
life
existing,
i
think
when
we're
talking
about
that
effort
to
make
sure
that
the
respiration
is
there
and
we
avoid
neurological
damage
is
part
of
it,
i
believe
that
we
are
guarding
that
adequately.
the
eighth
circuit
struck
this
down
saying
that
there
are
occasions
when
doctors
might
perform
an
abortion
in
the
period
of
viability
using
the
d&e,
dilatation
and
evacuation,
technique.
that
technique,
concededly,
if
it's
carried
through,
will
destroy
the
fetus.
it
dismembers
the
fetus,
usually
especially
as
in
larger
fetuses
which
you
would
expect
at
late
times
in
development,
as
it
withdraws
the
fetus
from
the
environment
of
the
mother,
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
that
fetus
is
not
going
to
survive.
it
was
thought
then
that
this
statute
be
overbroad
because
we
required
it
in
all
abortions
pursuant
to
the
determination
by
the
physician
of
viability.
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
so
overbroad
and
i
don't
believe
it
is
infirm.
and
the
court
in
beal
versus
doe
indicated
that
it's
not
until
the
time
of
viability
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
unduly
burden
the
decision.
but
it's
pretty
clear
that
in
that
third
trimester
there
are
such
strong
competing
interests
that
the
state
indeed
has
a
right
to
place
a
heavy
burden.
secondly,
i
don't
know
that
in
the
hospital
context,
that
a
second
physician
is
all
that
heavy
a
burden
which
is
imposed
in
this
circumstance.
thirdly,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
sometimes
a
decision
will
be
made
to
use
the
d&e
procedure,
and
the
d&e
procedure
would
not
be
carried
out
as
a
result
of
complications
encountered
in
the
procedure
itself.
at
such
time,
another
procedure
might
be
invoked
to
complete
the
surgery,
and
the
potential
life
should
be
guarded.
another
point
that
i
think
ought
to
be
made
in
relation
to
the
alleged
over-breadth
of
the
statute
in
this
context
is
that
when
the
doctor
who
is
choosing
what
type
of
abortion
ought
to
be
made
is
selecting
between
procedures,
his
awareness
that
a
second
doctor
will
be
involved
in
the
operation
i
think
is
a
therapeutic
influence.
d&e
procedures
are
generally
faster
and
easier
to
conduct,
and
the
one
doctor
in
this
case
that
testified
that
he
used
d&e
procedures
after
viability
is
the
same
doctor
who
testified
that
he
believed
that
the
mother
is
always
entitled
to
a
dead
fetus.
and
that
he
would
do,
and
generally
did,
nothing
to
try
and
protect
the
life
of
any
newborn
that
was
a
result
of
an
abortion;
that
it
wasn't
his
responsibility
and
he
had
no
interest
in
that.
i
don't
believe
that
that's
a
position
which
the
state
of
missouri
can
accept.
we
believe
that
that
potential
for
life
is
valid,
that
it's
real,
that
it's
important
and
that
we
ought
to
protect
it.
and
as
a
result,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
requirement
of
a
second
doctor
after
viability
is
an
overly-broad
requirement.
it
is
a
safeguard.
it
is
perhaps
burdensome,
but
it
is
well
justified
as
a
result
of
compelling
interest
of
the
state;
that
compelling
interest
of
the
state
being
in
relation
to
that
potential
life
of
the
unborn.
mr.
john
ashcroft
the
missouri
law
does
not.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
it
is
a
surgical
practice
for
such
to
be
the
case,
and
i
believe
that
it's
a
good
practice
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
legislature
to
recognize
that
and
to
require
it
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
john
ashcroft
pardon?
mr.
john
ashcroft
yes.
mr.
john
ashcroft
yes,
i
would.
mr.
john
ashcroft
there
are
two
other
issues
which
i
want
to
address
to
the
court
and
call
to
your
attention.
one
has
already
been
addressed
by
mr.
susman
in
this
matter.
that
issue
is
related
to
the
consent
provision
of
the
statute.
these
consent
provisions,
in
my
view,
are
as
close
to
a
direct
response
to
bellotti
2
as
you
could
possibly
get.
it's
almost...
well,
it's
just
very
interesting
that
the
statute
was
passed
three
weeks
before
the
decision,
but
it's
very
close.
if
the
court
has
a
right
to
provide
the
consent
absent
parental
consent,
the
court
is
to
do
that
if
the
plaintiff
is
not
mature
enough
to
make
a
decision
and
only
if
the
plaintiff
is
not
emancipated.
the
court
is
to
first
decide
whether
or
not
there's
adequate
maturity
to
reach
the
decision
on
the
part
of
the
minor.
the
court
secondly
is
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
minor
is,
indeed,
emancipated.
and
thirdly,
the
court
would
provide
for
consent
and
is
limited
to
good
cause
in
providing
that
consent...
and
good
cause
are
the
terms
used
in
the
statute...
requiring
legal
grounds
to
be
used
for
saying
if
in
the
event
the
court
determines
the
statute
not
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
minor,
those
have
to
be
good
cause
grounds
for
denying
it.
the
statute
says
that
the
court
shall
consider
the
emotional
development
of
the
minor,
the
nature
of
the
abortion,
the
possible
consequences
of
the
abortion,
the
alternatives
to
abortion,
the
intellectual
capability
and
understanding
of
the
minor.
we
are
asking
judges,
who
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
who
administer
the
law
fairly.
there
is
an
appeal
procedure
required
in
statute,
and
the
supreme
court
is
directed
in
the
statute,
once
it's
operative,
to
develop
an
expeditious
appeal
in
the
event
that
injustice
is
done
there.
i
believe
that
the
state
has
met
its
burden
in
this
case,
that
it
is
clearly
covered
by
the
bellotti
2
decision,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
consent
provision
which
was
upheld
by
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
mr.
john
ashcroft
i
think
that's
what
the
petitioner
said.
in
his
reply
brief.
that
was
the
first
time
we
heard
about
abstention.
mr.
john
ashcroft
my
answer
is
that
the
state
could
accept
abstention--
mr.
john
ashcroft
--yes,
we
could
easily
do
that.
we
argued
abstention
before
the
eighth
circuit
and
before
the
district
court.
and
this
is
the
first
time
we've
heard
about
abstention
in
this
matter.
mr.
john
ashcroft
no,
we
don't.
mr.
john
ashcroft
i
would
just
assume
that
the
state
courts
would
have
to
accommodate
this
court
by
a
ruling.
mr.
john
ashcroft
indeed,
that
is
what
i
urge
this
court
to
do.
mr.
john
ashcroft
i
don't
remember,
sir.
