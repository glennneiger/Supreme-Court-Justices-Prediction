justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that,
say
a
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
who
takes
an
oath
to
follow
the
constitution
who
writes
an
opinion
that
is
reversed
by
this
court
is
not
being
faithful
to
his
oath?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
ashcroft,
justice
stevens
asked
you
about
a
finding
of
fact
the
district
court
made
that
the
effect
of
the
statute...
and
i'm
simply
repeating
what
i
thought
either
he
said
or
you
said...
that
the
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
cut
down
the
number
of
abortions
actually
performed.
is
that
what
the
district
court
found?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
get
to
my
basic
question
i
want
to
put
to
you.
i
was
under
the
impression
this
statute
had
been
enjoined
from
taking
effect,
and
i'm
curious
to
know
if
the
district
court
did
find
that
this
was
the
effect
of
the
statute,
how
it
could
have
been
other
than
a
very
hypothetical
finding
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
had
never
been
in
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
his
finding
related
to
a
time
period
during
which
this
statute
wasn't
in
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
people
go
from
st.
louis?
east
st.
louis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
east
st.
louis.
you
just
cross
the
bridge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
why
the
70
provision
respecting
hospitals
from
1974
to
79
in
effect
then
was
not
challenged,
whereas
this
one,
which
you
say
is
identical,
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
will
you
tell
me?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
thought
that
our
constitutional
doctrine
should
change
because
views
of
organizations
like
the
american
public
health
association
changed?
