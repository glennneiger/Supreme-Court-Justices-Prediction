mr.
winkler,
i
think
in
your
briefs
you
didn't
deal
with
the
section
306(a)
of
the
multi-employer
pension
plan
amendments,
plan
amendments
act
of
1980.
are
you
going
to
treat
it
in
your
oral
argument?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
guess
i
didn't
notice
that.
i
am
sorry.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
the
brief
of
a
party
in
higdon,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
employees
couldn't
sue
under
those
circumstances,
a
301
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
one
of
the
requirements
for
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
the
union
has
to
represent
the
employees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
8(f)
shed
light
on
whether
the...
one
of
the
requirements
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
that
the
union
represent
the
employees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
in
a
case
where
the
union
had
been
at
one
time
certified
as
the
majority
representative?
