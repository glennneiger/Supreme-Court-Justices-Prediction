well,
mr.
jett,
even
if
we
affirm
the
ninth
circuit
here,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
moving
a
lot
to
the
courts,
wouldn't
it,
unless
your
view
were
adopted
in
the
process?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
respond
to
mr.
winkler's
position,
though,
that
the
board
itself
has
viewed
these
agreements
as
unenforceable?
