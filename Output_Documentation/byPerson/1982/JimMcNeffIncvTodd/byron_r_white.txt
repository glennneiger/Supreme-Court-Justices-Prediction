what
is
necessary
for
the
employer
to
escape
the
pre-hire
agreement
under
the
judgment
that
you
are
attacking.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
is
your...
that
is
your
view.
but
what,
under
the
decision
below,
what
is
necessary
for
the
employer
to
escape?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
notice
of
repudiation
cannot
be
just
a
refusal
to
abide
by
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
it
were...
even
if
a
refusal
to
comply
was
a
notice
as
to
the
future,
it
wouldn't
be
effective
to
negate
obligations
accrued
up
to
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your...
your
view
is
that
nothing
in
the
contract
is
binding
on
the
employer
until
there's
a
majority
representation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
board...
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
it's
the
board's
view
when
the
general
counsel
is
on
this
brief
for
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
not
one
and
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
an
amicus
case.
i
suppose
if
the
board
were
a
party--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
this
case,
and
then
there's
a
brief
filed
on
its
behalf,
you
should
be
able
to
assume
that
it
represents
the
board's
view,
shouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
the
case
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
brief
of
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
not
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
prevail
in
higdon?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
happens
in
a...
outside
the
construction
industry
when...
when
an
employer
purports
to
recognize
a
minority
union
and
execute
a
contract
with
that
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
enforceable
in
a
301
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
give
me
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
the
authority
of
the
board,
but
what
about
the...
what
about
a
301
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
wel,
suppose
that
an
employer
signs...
outside
the
construction
industry,
signs
a
contract
with
a
minority
union
and
perhaps
everybody
promising
to
pay
a
certain
wage,
and
one
day
he
just
lowers
the
wage
unilaterally,
and
then
he
gets
sued
in
a
301
action
for...
for
the
contract
wage.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
they
collect?
could
they
collect
the
promised
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
glazers...
your
case
is
a
fortiori
from
the
glazers
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the...
under
301
what
would
be
the
theory
of...
that
the
employer
would
use
if
he's
sued,
just
like
in
this
case,
and
he
came
back
and
said,
well,
i
sent
you
notice
last
week
that
i
am
repudiating
the
contract?
and
what
does...
what's
the
301
theory
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
different
from
the
board
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that's
a
board
brief,
either,
eh?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
once
you've
signed
the
pre-hire
agreement,
once
the
employer
signs,
under
your
view,
he
is
permanently
stuck
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
is
he
not
subject
to
suit
in
the
301
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
employer,
before
he
can
get
out
of
the
agreement,
he
has
to...
he
has
to
precipitate
a
representation
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
has
to
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
changes
the
burden,
the
pre-hire
changes
the
burden
with
respect...
it
changes
the
normal
rules
with
respect
to
how
a...
how
majority
status
is
to
be
determined?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you...
the
employer,
unless
there
is
some
solid
evidence
of
majority
representation,
an
employer
isn't
normally
required
to
act
like
the
union
is
the
majority
representative.
and
if
he
says,
look,
you've
had
plenty
of
time
to
get...
to
get...
to
get
yourself
organized
and
you
aren't,
and
i
am
repudiating
the
pre-hire
agreement
right
now
because
you
just
don't
represent
the...
the
employers.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
employees.
and
you
say,
well,
no,
the
pre-hire
is
going
to
force
him
to
go
to
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
order
to
prove
that
the
union
isn't
the
majority
representative.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you...
so
you
do
say
that
pre-hire
does
change
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
would
force
the...
you
would
force
the
employer
before
the
board
in
any
case
where
he
seriously
doubted
the...
the
majority
status
of
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
true,
mr.
jett,
that
the...
according
to
your
position,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
where
this
majority
status
issue
is
to
be
litigated
or
even
whether
it
is
to
be.
until
it
is,
you
say
the
contract's
enforceable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
don't...
it's...
it's...
all
you
have
to
say
is
that
the
majority
status
has
never
been
determined
and
you're
suing
for
back
pay,
so
to
speak.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
like
to
go
on
prevailing
on
the
same
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
would
be
necessarily
obligated
to
hear
the
issue
rather
than
defer
to
the
board
and
tell
the
parties
to
take
it
to
the
board
as
a
matter
of
primary
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
jett,
you
don't...
i
don't
think
you're
going
to...
you're
going
to
say
that
every
time
you
sued
on
a
pre-hire
agreement
and
the
employer
said...
said,
sorry,
but
i
am
repudiating
right
now,
you're
not
going
to
wage
a
losing
battle,
you're
not
going
to
litigate
forever
when
you
know
you
don't
have
majority
status.
and
i
am...
i
wouldn't
think
the
employer,
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
it,
or
if
there
is
substantial
doubt
about
it,
is
going
to
litigate
forever
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
certainly
would
agree,
i
suppose,
that
if
the
employer
took
it
to
the
board,
the
question
of
majority
status
to
the
board,
and
he
won,
that
you
haven't
got
any
contract
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
from...
from
at
least
the
prospective.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
is
unilateral
change,
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice,
is
that
it?
