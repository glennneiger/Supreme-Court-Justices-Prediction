may
i
just
ask
one
question
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
the
enforceabilty
of
the
agreement
depends
on
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
a
majority
status.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when,
in
your
view,
is
it
appropriate
for
that
determination
to
be
made?
is
it
your
view
that
the
employer
can
just
wait
until
the
union
sues
to,
in
this
case,
to
collect
the
pension
obligations,
just
wait
until
they
sue
and
then
you
have
a
trial
of
whether
there
is
majority
status?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
say
that
if
the...
if
the
company
had
in
fact
made
the
payments
and
then
realized
that
the
union
never
acquired
majority
status,
that
it
could
sue
for
a
refund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
also
be
true
that
the
employer
could
pay
below
the
union
scale
as
long
as
nobody
complained
about
it
and
then
later
on
the
employees
might
say,
well,
you
signed
the
pre-hire
agreement
which...
well,
in
this
case
i
take
it
there
was
an
undertaking
to
pay
according
to
the
union
scale.
would
that
obligation
also
be
unenforceable,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
a
matter
of
voluntary,
unless
the
employer
voluntarily
elects
to
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
he
said
he
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
winkler,
you
know,
it's
correct
about
your
opponent,
but,
you
know,
the
government
cited
the
r.j.
smith
case.
they
found
it
distinguishable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
solicitor
general
cited
the
r.j.
smith
case
and
seems
to
think
it's
distinguishable.
