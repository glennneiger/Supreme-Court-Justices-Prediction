mr.
wayne
jett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
mcneff
has
argued
from
the
viewpoint
that
because
a
breach
of
a
section
8(f)
agreement
before
majority
status
is
achieved
is
not
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
that
breach
then
cannot
be
remedied
by
a
suit
brought
under
section
301.
however,
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs
that
section
8(a)(5)
cases
and
all
unfair
labor
practice
cases
are
government
litigation
pursued
by
the
government
at
government
expense
to
enforce
rights
and
duties
that
are
created
by
statute
under
the
act.
by
comparison,
private
rights
and
duties
that
are
created
by
private
agreement
have
been
left
to
enforcement
according
to
the
normal
processes
of
the
courts
under
section
301
litigation.
that
is
a
tandem
system
of
handling
labor
disputes
that
has
served
the
country
well
since
1947
when
section
301
was
enacted.
there
is
no
reversal
involved
of
any
section
8(a)(5)
case
in
enforcing
the
contract
rights
in
a
judicial
action.
those
section
8(a)(5)
cases
would
be
exactly
as
valid
with
the
enforcement
of
contract
rights
in
this
section
301
action
as
they
are
presently;
namely,
the
government
would
not
issue
a
complaint
and
would
pursue
litigation
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
to
enforce
a
contract
when
majority
status
is
not
shown.
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
at
least
two
clear
similar
circumstances
in
which...
one
of
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
iron
workers
case.
for
example,
section
8(e)
agreements,
the
hot-cargo
clauses,
are
not
enforceable
by
picketing,
just
as
the
minority
agreement
in
iron
workers
was
not
enforceable
by
picketing
because
of
the
limitations
of
section
8(b)(7).
however,
those
hot-cargo
clauses
are
clearly
enforceable
by
judicial
action.
in
addition,
we
have
also
shown
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
decision
of
this
court,
in
which
it
clearly
recognizes
the
established
rule
of
law
that
nonmandatory
subjects
of
agreement
may
be
included
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
and
when
they
are,
they
are
judicially
enforceable.
however,
they
are
not
enforceable
by
government
litigation
under
section
8(a)(5)
cases.
and
that
is
what
pittsburgh
plate
glass
held.
mr.
wayne
jett
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
it
would
not
be,
because--
mr.
wayne
jett
--because--
mr.
wayne
jett
--according
to
our
argument,
we
would
agree
with
this
court's
decision
in
carey
versus
westinghouse
electric.
this
court
has
said
that
if
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
involved
in
the
execution
of
a
labor
agreement,
the
superior
authority
of
the
board
can
be
invoked
at
any
time
in
order
to
hold
the--
mr.
wayne
jett
--well,
your
honor,
as
far
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
involved
in
a
301
case
in
the
situation
you're
talking
about,
if
there
is
an
allegation
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
board
in
the
form
of
a
charge.
now,
such
a
case
has
just
been
litigated
in--
mr.
wayne
jett
--your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
exact
circumstance--
mr.
wayne
jett
--has
just
been
litigated
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
wayne
jett
it's
the
glazers
case
that
was
cited
in
our
brief.
and
what
happened
is
the
court
said...
and
analyzed
iron
workers
in
doing
so,
analyzed
the
issues
largely
before
this
court.
what
happened
was
they
said
if
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
involved,
it
is
to
be
presented
to
the
board.
mr.
wayne
jett
they
could
sue,
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
wayne
jett
--the...
the
iron
workers...
the
glazers
case
enforces
the
contract
and
says
it
does
so
because
the
unfair
labor
practice
must
be
kept
under
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
that
otherwise
that
would
require
litigation
of
the
intent
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
statutes
in
section
301
cases,
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
glazers
versus
custom
model
case
declined
to
do
that.
and
i...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the--
mr.
wayne
jett
--it
certainly
is
highly
consistent
with
our
case.
it
adopts
the
same
arguments
that
we
have
made.
it
simply
is
a
situation
which
is
outside
the
construction
industry.
and
i
think
it
is
a
more
clear
representation
of
the
ninth
circuit's
view
as
to
whether
employee
representational
issues...
in
other
words,
the
litigation
of
majority
status...
can
be
litigated
before
the
courts
in
section
301
cases
as
opposed
to
before
the
board.
and
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
came
down
in
a
well-reasoned
opinion
there
that
came
out
after...
well,
it
had
not
been
officially
reported
as
yet
at
the
time
of
our
brief,
but
we
cited
it,
and
it
has
been,
of
course,
officially
reported.
but
they
followed
the
same
analysis
essentially
that
we
did
in
analyzing
the
references
to
litigation
of
majority
status
in
iron
workers
and
said
that
that
was
not
by
any
means
a
holding,
it
was
not
a
301
case
that
was
litigated
in
iron
workers,
it
simply
was
a
matter
of
turning
aside
an
invalid
union
argument
made
in
the
iron
workers
case.
now--
mr.
wayne
jett
--your
honor,
we
have
argued
that
repudiation
is
not
a
proper
defense.
we...
we
have
argued
that
there
is
no
right
of
repudiation.
mr.
wayne
jett
we
are
different
from
the
government's
brief
in
that
respect.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
it
is
to
the
extent
that
it
represents
the
government's
views.
however,
i
must
note
that,
as
the
court
has
already
mentioned,
that
this
is
not
a
case
that
has
had
the
benefit
of
being
litigated
through
the
board's
processes
so
that
the
board
itself
has
had
the
benefit
of
a
full
record
and
having
briefs
and
arguments
made
before
the
board
and
developed
it
on
the
basis
of
its
expertise.
mr.
wayne
jett
not
at
all,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
wayne
jett
--the
agreement,
according
to
our
argument,
is
that
he
would
not
be
bound
to
the
agreement
after
the
board
certifies
a
union
election
result
that
the
union
has
lost.
that
is
exactly
the
same
treatment--
mr.
wayne
jett
--an
election
has
to
be
precipitated,
we'll
put
it
that
way.
mr.
wayne
jett
the
employer
may
do
it.
as
the
iron
workers
decision
says,
when
this
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
agreement
was
voidable,
the
precise
means
and
the
only
means
that
this
court
referred
to
was
the
filing
of
a
petition
under
the
proviso.
and
that
filing
of
a
petition,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief,
keeps
all
employee
representation
issues...
the
determination
of
appropriate
bargaining
unit,
the
determination
of
eligibility
of
voters...
all
of
those
aspects
are
kept
before
the
board.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
it
does
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it...
in
order
to
pursue
our
argument,
it
keeps
it
exactly
where
it
has
been
since
301
was
enacted;
and
that
is,
all
employee
representation
issues
are
determined
by
the
board
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
they
always
have.
and
that's
an
awfully
important
aspect.
mr.
wayne
jett
well,
your
honor--
mr.
wayne
jett
--your
honor,
what--
mr.
wayne
jett
--what
it
would
force
him
to
do,
require
him
to
do
is
to
do
what
he
agreed
to
do;
that
is,
perform
according
to
the
agreement
until
there
is
an
expression
of
self-determination
by
the
employees
in
which
they
vote
out
the
union.
mr.
wayne
jett
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
it
does
to
this
extent:
as
this
court
recognized
in
iron
workers,
8(f)
specifically
was
intended
as
an
exception
to
the
general
requirement
of
the
law
that
there
be
majority
status
before
a
contract
can
be
signed.
and
let
me,
if
i
might,
look
specifically
at
the
objectives
of
congress
when
they
enacted
section
8(f).
i
believe
there
are
four
clear
objectives
that
can
be
identified.
the
first
one
is
that
the
employers
in
the
construction
industry
needed
the
ability
to
sign
binding
contracts
that
would
establish
firmly
their
wage
rates
that
could
then
be
used
by
them
in
preparing
bids
that
would
be
entered
into
competitive
bidding
for
construction
projects.
when
those
bids
are
accepted,
the
employer
is
bound
contractually
to
perform
by
them,
and
he
needs
reliable
labor
costs.
otherwise,
he
is
substantially
at
risk.
secondly,
to
the
same
extent,
it
is
very
common
in
the
construction
industry
that
time
is
of
the
essence
in
performing
a
construction
contract
once
he
gets
the
winning
bid.
therefore,
he
needs
a
ready
source
of
labor
that
he
can
call
on
immediately
in
order
to
perform
the
contract.
it's
not
common
at
all
for
the
way
construction
projects
develop
and
bids
are
won,
the
employer
normally
cannot
afford
to
keep
a
full
staff
of
workmen
on
his
staff
and
on
his
payroll.
he
must
have
a
source
of
workmen.
and
he
needs
that
on
a
reliable,
a
contractually
reliable
basis.
now,
from
the
union
standpoint,
there
were
also
two
objectives.
the
unions
needed
to
have
some
approach
to
stabilize
working
conditions
in
their
geographic
areas
over
a
period
of
years.
and
the
legislative
history
clearly
recognizes
that
they
had
been
doing
that
by
the
practices
of
signing
agreements
applicable
to
geographic
areas
over
1,
2,
or
3
years.
i
would
cite
the
legislative
history,
since
it
has
been
questioned
in
the
reply
brief,
pages
423
to
25,
pages
451
and
52,
page
759
and
777.
clearly,
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
validate
the
practice
of
signing
binding
contracts
that
would
stabilize
working
conditions
within
an
area
so
that
the
union
and
the
employer
would
not
have
to
bid
on
a
project
or
to
bargain
on
a
project-by-project
basis
after
the
employees
got
out
on
the
site
where
there
could
be
disruption
of
work
at
the
job
site.
and
fourth,
the
fourth
objective
is
also
a
union
objective.
congress
recognized
that
because
of
the
high
mobility
and
the
short...
shortness
of
jobs
in
the
construction
industry,
that
the
construction
unions
did
need
certain
organizing
mechanisms
that
were
out
of
the
ordinary
for
other
industries.
one
of
those,
they
recognized
that
the
unions
needed
an
exclusive
hiring
hall
to
refer
their
workmen
out,
and
they
also
recognized
a
need
for
the
7-day
union
security
clause.
both
of
those
objectives,
both
of
those
mechanisms
are
expressed
precisely
in
the
wording
of
section
8(f).
now,
i
refer
to
those
objectives
in
some
detail
because
they
must
be
examined
to
recognize
that
every
one
of
those
four
objectives
of
congress
requires
a
binding
contract
in
order
to
achieve
it.
congress
looked
at
the
existing
law
at
that
time
and
said
that,
well,
they've
got
to
have
a
binding
contract
in
order
to
achieve
those
objectives;
right
now
they
have
to
show
majority
status
before
they
can
sign
that.
now,
if
they
were...
if
we
were
to
follow
that
approach,
we
would
have
to
be
ready
for
the
nlrb
to
conduct
elections
and
every
bargaining
unit
from
the
construction
industry.
and
clearly,
the
legislative
history
says
at
several
places
it's
not
feasible
in
the
construction
industry
to
contemplate
having
elections
in
every
unit
in
order
to
certify
the
union
as
the
bargaining
agent.
they
said,
therefore,
because
of
that,
the
infeasibility
of
elections
in
every
unit
and
because
we
need
these
four
objectives
under
the
circumstances
of
the
construction
industry
to
be
met,
we
are
authorizing
the
pre-hire
agreement,
we
are
validating
the
practices
that
have
been
used
by
the
unions,
and
we
are
doing
it
by
enacting
section
8(f).
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
in
order
to
present
a
question
of
employee
representation,
it
is
all...
has
always
been
the
requirement
that
that
question
of
representation
be
presented
to
the
board.
the
cases
are
replete
that
the
board
is
the
administrative
tribunal
that
has
the
expertise
to
make
that
decision.
and
let
me
say
this
about
the
prospect
of
a
transfer
wholesale
of
the
employee
representation
issues
in
the
construction
industry
from
the
board,
where
it's
been
for
the
last
25
years,
into
the
courts.
the
courts
simply
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
continue
absorbing
the
additional
doses
of
litigation
that
they're
getting.
the
litigation
arena
is
too
crowded
already.
and
under
such
a
ruling,
under
301
cases,
both
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
would
then
be
involved
in
litigating
majority
status
issues.
it's
doubly
troublesome
to
contemplate
moving
employee
representation
issues
from
the
board
to
the
courts
for
this
reason.
if
anything,
the
litigation
burden
on
the
courts
would
indicate
that
legislatively
those
burdens
should
be
moved
from
the
courts
to
administrative
tribunals.
and
yet
we
would
have
thousands
and
thousands
of
employee
representation
issues.
in
effect,
every
enforcement
of
a
pre-hire
agreement
would
be
litigated
in
the
courts
rather
than
the
board.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
to
adopt
the
ninth
circuit's
view,
it
would
result
in
moving
majority
status
to
the
courts.
that
was
stated
in
dictum
views
because
even
under
the
ninth
circuit's
view
holding
for
us,
there
was
no
repudiation
here.
but
that
is
why
we
are
pointing
out
it's
so...
it's
such
an
important
aspect
of
this
case
that
the
proper
legal
structure
for
deciding
the
case
is
set,
because
if
it
is...
if
courts
are
led
to
believe
that
those
issues
of
majority
status
of
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit,
all
of
those
things
that
go
into
determining
majority
status,
it's
by
no
means
just
a
situation
of
checking
the
payroll
and
determining
who
is
a
union
member.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
they...
the
board
has
not
reviewed...
viewed
them
as
unenforceable
under
301.
the
board
has
never
decided
that
issue.
it
wouldn't
be
called
upon.
that's
what's
before
this
court.
it
is
unenforceable
from
the
standpoint
that
the
government
will
not
pursue
litigation
at
government
expense
under
section
8(a)(5)
to
enforce
that
agreement.
so
that...
that
would
stand
completely.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
regard
to
the
erisa
amendment
that
basically
the
same
government
attitude
toward
the
enforcement
of
these
private
rights
is
maintained
in
erisa,
because
while
the
erisa
amendment
creates
the
statutory
right
or
obligation
to
perform
the
contract,
there
is
also
a
part
of
that
amendment
that
says
the
secretary
of
labor
will
not
initiate
litigation
to
enforce
that
contract.
and
so
basically,
it
is
simply
a
situation
that
the
board
has
said
and
erisa
has
said
that
the
government
is
not
going
to
expend
its
agency
resources
to
enforce
this
as
a
matter
of
public
policy.
however,
under
the
erisa
amendment,
they
did
add
the
provision
that
entitles
the
private
trustees
to
recover
their
costs
of
pursuing
that
litigation.
so
in
that
respect
of
what
the
erisa
amendment
did
is
simply
add
the
statutory
obligation
that
8(a)(5)
doesn't
provide
for
performance
here,
it
adds
the
statutory
obligation
but
again
it
leaves
the
litigation
in
private
hands
just
as
it
was
under
301.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
i
believe
that
it
is
common
usage
in
erisa
to
speak
in
that
terminology
as
opposed
to
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it--
mr.
wayne
jett
--i
believe
that
erisa,
while
it
intended
collectively
bargained
agreement
to
apply
broadly
to
these
kinds
of
agreements,
i
believe
they
were
not
concerning
themselves
with
the
intricacies
of
unfair
labor
practice
law
in
terms
of
recognizing
the
policies
of
the
board
in
any
detail.
but
i
believe
that
at
the
very
minimum
what
has
to
be
said
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
erisa
amendment
is
that
with
the
citation
of
the
overhead
door
case
that
expressed
disapproval
of
overhead
door
and
mcdowell,
both
of
them
being
clearly
8(f)
cases
in
which
majority
status
was
raised,
the
minimum
that
can
be
said
is
that
congress
intended
that
that
statutory
obligation
in
section
515
applies
to
8(f)
agreements.
they
viewed
those
agreements--
mr.
wayne
jett
--correct,
your
honor,
although
i
would
say
this.
i
don't
believe
the
history
of
section
8(f)
indicates
that
a
pre-hire
agreement
is
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
iron
workers
was...
was
specific
and
express
in
saying
that...
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
move
to
the
status
of
a
section
9
representative
which
would
entitle
it
to
enforcement
under
section
8(a)(5).
but
it
didn't
say
that...
that
this
is
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
my
estimation,
clearly
it's
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
sets
wages
and
working
conditions
for
employees
on
whose
behalf
the
union
bargained.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
it
is,
except
in
8(f)
cases.
and
what
congress
intended
to
do
in
8(f)
was
enable
both
employers
and
unions
to
step
into
the
vacuum
that
exists
before
a
project
is
actually
manned.
mr.
wayne
jett
your
honor,
i
believe
that
section
8(f)
specifically
contemplates
agreements
and
binding
agreements
in
which
it
expressly
is
with
a
minority
union.
that's
specifically
and
expressly
what
8(f)
intends,
that
you
be
able
to
enter
into
binding
agreements
when
it
is
conceded
that
the
union
is
a
minority
union.
that's
what
it
says
on
its
face.
and
the
only...
the
only
point
that
congress
saw
fit
to
protect
was
that
enabling
employers
and
unions
to
step
into
this
vacuum
and
deal
with
binding
contracts
on
the
basis
that
met
the
needs
of
both
parties
was
the
proviso...
they
didn't
want
the
employers
and
the
unions
to
stick
the
employees
with
something
that
the
employees
didn't
want.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history
on
the
purpose
of
the
proviso,
the
clearest
explanation
i
find
of
exactly
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
what
was
bothering
it
on
the
proviso
appears
in
the...
in
the
committee
print
of
the
senate
subcommittee
on
labor
that
was
published
right
at
the
time
the
joint
conference
adopted
the
senate
version
of
section
8(f).
and
that
proviso,
or
that
explanation
on
a
section-by-section
basis
explains
the
proviso
with
a
more
limited
purpose
even
than
what
we
have
discussed
so
far.
it
says
this:
agreements
permitted
by
this
section
may
not
operate
as
a
bar
to
a
petition
for
an
election
sought
by
a
union
not
party
to
such
agreements.
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
in
light
of
that
explanation,
and
what
congress
was
really
worrying
about
when
it
added
the
proviso
is
they...
and
the
legislative
history
shows
clearly
they
were
concerned
about
sweetheart
contracts
between
corrupt
employers
and
paper
unions.
i
cite
the
the
committee
statement
of
the
legislative
history
at
page
967.
and
the
paper
union/sweetheart
contract
motive
is
shown
in
the
legislative
history
at
page
425
and
at
pages
992
and
994.
so
under
that
circumstance,
what
they
were
really
protecting
against
is...
is
the
employees
getting
stuck
with
a
sweet
deal
that
benefited
the
employer
and
the
union
but
not
the
employees.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
that
the
employees
are
disadvantaged--
mr.
wayne
jett
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
jett
in
terms
of
this
contract...
or
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
there
was
neither
repudiation
under
the
ninth
circuit
view
or
a
determination
of
majority
status
until
after
the
period
that
was
enforced
in
the
contract.
and
clearly,
we
would
prevail
on
that
basis.
but
once
again,
it
is
most
important--
mr.
wayne
jett
--it
is
most
important
that
the
right
reasons
be
given
for
that
prevailing;
otherwise,
the
wrong
reasons
will
undoubtedly
lead
to
erroneous
decisions
in
future
cases.
and
certainly,
the
decision
we
believe
of
the
ninth
circuit,
at
least
the
dictum
on
handling
majority
status
in
the
courts,
would
certainly
lead
to
very
erroneous
decisions...
that
is,
the
litigation
of
majority
status
in
the
courts.
now--
mr.
wayne
jett
--your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
an
extremely
important
point
here
and
one
actually
that
the
petitioner
has
taken
both
sides
of.
if
you
look
at
the
opening
brief
of
the
petitioner
here,
they've
argued
that
it
was
improper...
or
that
the
district
court
should
have
deferred
to
the
board,
and
argues
quite
extensively
that
that
should
be
done.
they
are
now
arguing
essentially
that,
yes,
it
ought
to
be
litigated
in
the...
in
the
courts.
now,
we
believe
that
if
the
court
were
to
take
the
view
that,
yes,
the
agreements
are
void
ab
initio,
if
you...
if
you
don't
prove
majority
status
and
they're
a
nullity
from
the
beginning,
it
would
certainly
be
better
to
defer
to
the
board
for
a
determination
of
majority
status
than
to
litigate
in
the
courts.
mr.
wayne
jett
well,
your
honor,
of
course,
our...
our
trustees,
the
parties
respondent
here--
mr.
wayne
jett
--are
in
the
position
of
attempting
to
enforce
the
fringe
benefit
rights,
and
are
in
the
position
that
in
order
to...
if...
if
the
ninth
circuit
were
to
be
taken
at
face
value
on
the
dictum,
would
be
in
the
position
of
having
to
come
up
with
union
majority
status
proved
to
see
whether
it
could
be
proved
to
the
court's
satisfaction
that
that
was
established
before
repudiation.
we
would
not
be
in
the
position,
of
course,
of
going
beyond
what
evidence
is
available.
but
at
the
same
time,
we
would
have
the
prospect
of
needing
to
enforce
contract
rights
that
have
accrued
to
the
employees
involved.
now,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
wayne
jett
--your
honor,
if
we--
mr.
wayne
jett
--from
that
date
forward,
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
have
shown
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
my
letter
citing
the
two
additional
cases
that
was
presented
to
the
court
today,
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
board's
policy
in
that
matter
in
non-construction
industry
cases.
in
a
non-construction
industry
circumstance,
when
a
petition
is
filed
and
goes
to
election
and
the
contract
basically
is
still
in
effect,
the
board's
clear
policy
is
that
the
contract
remains
in
effect
to
the
date
of
board
certification
of
election
results.
mr.
wayne
jett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
but
as
far
as...
and
i
might
refer
to
that.
that's
the
trico
products
case
that
i
cited
today.
it
goes
in
some
detail
into
the
board
policy,
that
to
create
a
hiatus
or
instability
simply
on
the
filing
of
the
petition
would
be
adverse
to
the
policies
of
the
act
because
the
employees
would
be
unsure
of
what
their
rights
are
until
the
time
of
actual
certification.
mr.
wayne
jett
not
necessarily
so,
your
honor.
it
would
be
in
a
situation
in
which
at
least
there
had
been
recognition
of
majority
status,
because,
as
i
said,
that's
a
non-construction
industry
case.
and
that
would
not
necessarily
be
a
board
certification.
in
other
words,
a
petition
can
be
filed
at
a
certain
window
of
time
during
which
the
contract
does
not
present
a
bar,
and
when
the
board
then
proceeds
to
an
election
the
board
says
that
its
clear
policy
is
to
maintain
the
status
quo
of
the
agreement
until
the
time
that
the
election
results
are
actually
certified.
now,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
two
concepts
that
i
think
have...
have
come
round
to
the
argument
that
is
made
by
petitioner
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
most
important
to
deal
with
the
concepts
of
repudiation
and
voluntariness,
in
order
to
clarify
the
way
in
which
they
have
been
intermixed.
repudiation
is
the
concept
that
the
board
has
developed
under
8(a)(5)
cases
in
which
the
employer
can
breach
the
contract--
mr.
wayne
jett
--thank
you.
