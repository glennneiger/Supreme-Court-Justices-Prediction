mr.
james
t.
winkler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
pursuant
to
writ
of
certiorari
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
section
1254.
respondents,
the
operating
engineers
trust
fund,
filed
a
complaint
for
fringe
benefit
collection
pursuant
to
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
the
district
court
on
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
granted
motion
for
summary
judgment
for
respondents.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
decision
passed
on
the
issue
of
the
enforceability
of
minority
pre-hire
agreements
and
noted
in
its
decision
the
conflicting
decisions
of
the
various
circuits
and
that
adopted
what
it
called
to
be
a
middle
ground
between
the
decisions
of
the
eighth
and
tenth
and
the...
on
one
hand
which
state
that
301
actions
are
different
than
unfair
labor
practice
actions
and
the
conflicting
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
adopted
the
nrlb
position
that
the
minority
pre-hire
agreements
are
unenforceable
unless
the
union
represents
the
majority
of
the
employees.
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
what
it
called
a
middle
ground,
that
there
has
to
be
a
notice
of
repudiation;
until
then
minority
agreements
are
fully
enforceable
and
that
the
issue
of
coercion
in
obtaining
the
pre-hire
agreements
is
not
applicable
until
that
notice
of
repudiation.
now,
the
department
interpretation
in
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
section
8(f)
of
the
act
and
this
court's
decision
in
higdon.
higdon
involved
an
unfair
labor
practice
matter,
and
therefore
it
is
important
to
try
and
figure
out
what
effect
an
unfair
labor
practice
context
will
have
in
a
section
301
litigation.
and
in
view
of
that,
it
is
important
to
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
howard
johnson,
which
said
that
the
basic
policies
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
context
cannot
be
ignored
in
a
section
301
case.
in
howard
johnson
it
involved
a
burns
successorship
issue...
excuse
me,
it
involved
an
attempt
by
a
union
to
apply
the
contract
of
a
predecessor
to
a
successor,
and
then
burns
was
not
allowed
in
the
section
8(a)(5)
context.
this
was
again
attempted
in
the
301
context
in
howard
johnson,
and
this
court
would
not
allow
that.
now,
in
order
to
understand
the
board's
position
in
section
8(a)(5),
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
board's
position
in
r.j.
smith.
the
board's
case...
the
case
of
r.j.
smith
was
commented
extensively
by...
upon
extensively
by
this
court
in
higdon.
in
r.j.
smith
it
involved
an
employer
which
had
not
complied
with
the
pre-hire
agreement.
according
to
the
administrative
law
judge
before
the
board,
the
administrative
law
judge
said
that
there's...
noncompliance
had
been
concealed
from
the
union.
and
that's
a
very
important
point.
despite
this
active
noncompliance
by
the
union,
the
board
reviewed
legislative
history
and
decided
that
because
there
was
no
majority
status,
that
the
contract
was
unenforceable.
and
it
is
important
to
note
that
it
did
review
legislative
history
and
in
the...
in
its
interpretation
of
section
8(f)
of
the
act.
it
noted
that
there
are
certain
provisions
that...
there
are
certain
exceptions
in
section
8(f)
that
congress
intended
to
allow...
excuse
me...
congress
intended
to
allow
for
employers
to
have
a
steady
access
of...
a
steady
supply
of
workmen
from
the
labor
organization
and
to...
excuse
me...
the
provisions
that
congress
wanted
to
allow
in
enacting
section
8(f),
it
wanted
to
allow
employers
to
have
two
benefits.
one
was
to
give
the
employers
an
opportunity
to
have
workmen
provided
by
the
union.
because
employers
often
go
from
job
site
to
job
site
in
the
construction
industry,
they
don't
necessarily
have
their
stable
complement
of
employees.
and
secondly,
pre-hire
agreements
would
allow
employers
the
opportunity
to
make
bids
based
on
a
predetermined
cost.
now,
because
of
these
two
benefits,
congress
allowed
pre-hire
agreements
to
be
not
unlawful
under
section
8(a)
and
8(b)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
but
the
board
noted
that
the
section
8(f)
language
itself
showed
the
limits
of
its
effect,
and
it
noted
the
proviso
to
section
8(f)
which
stated
that
an
election
may
be
called
upon
by
any...
by
anybody
and
it
would
not
despite
the
existence
of
the
contract.
now,
normally,
elections
cannot
be
obtained
when
there
is
an
existence
of
a
contract
in
the...
in
any...
excuse
me...
in
any
other
industry.
now,
it
is
very
important
to
note
that
right
after
noting
this
intent
of
the
proviso,
the
board
then
stated
that,
and
i
quote,
"thus,
the
proviso
constitutes
a
statutory
safeguard
against
just
the
sort
of
irresponsibly
imposed
minority
union
representation
which
this
record
reveals.
"
that's
a
very
important
quote.
i
didn't
put
that
in
my
brief
or
the
reply
brief.
the
board
then
went
on
and
said,
because
you
can
file
an
election
petition,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
purpose
to
not
allow
an
examination
of
majority
status
in
the
litigation
of
refusal
to
bargain
in
cases
where
the
employer
is
refusing
to
comply
with
the
agreement.
so
the
old
issue
in
r.j.
smith
was
the
retroactive
application...
was
the
retroactive
enforcement
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
pre-hire
agreement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
argued
that
you
couldn't
look
back
beyond
6
months,
the
statute
10(b),
statute
of
limitations,
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
bryant
and
the
usual
presumption
of
majority
status
that
it
can
only...
usual
presumption
of
majority
status
in
collective
bargaining
agreement
can
only
be
attacked
within
the
last
6
months
by
filing
a
charge
with
the
labor
board
showing
that
it
was
obtained
unlawfully
because
it
was
a
minority
union.
but
the
board
said
that
doesn't
matter
here,
because
it's
not
unlawful
to
enter
into
an
8(f)
agreement.
therefore,
we
can
go
back
beyond
the
6
months
and
look
back,
way
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
agreement
to
find
out
when
it
was,
what
kind
of
an
agreement
it
was,
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
majority
status
to
support
it.
so
the
entire
purpose
of
the
r.j.
smith
decision
was
to
look
back
and
see
whether
or
not
it
could
be
retroactively
applied.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
the
d.c.
circuit
denied
enforcement
and
adopted
the
theory
that
respondents
argue
in
their
brief
that
you
have
to
actually
file
for
a
petition
for
an
election
and
until
that
point
in
time
the
contract
is
enforceable.
the
board
did
not
take
the
petition
for
certiorari
at
that
time.
it
waited
until
the
higdon
case.
and
it's
important
to
note
in
the
higdon
case
it
sort
of
reached
the
issue
in
the
back-door
manner.
higdon
was
an
8(b)(7)(c)
matter
involving
unlawful
picketing
for
recognition.
and
it's
important
to
note
that
the
issue
of
minority
status
is
not
at
all
involved
in
the
issues,
the
basic
element
to
an
8(b)(c)
violation.
an
8(b)(c)
violation
is
made
up
of
basically
picketing
for
an
unreasonable
period
of
time
not
to
exceed
30
days
where
the
object
is
recognitional
and
there
has
been
no
petition
filed
for
an
election
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
minority
status
of
a
union.
the
issue
only
comes
into
effect
in
an
affirmative
defense
if
the
board
has
said
that
the
literal
terms
of
8(b)(7)(c)
do
not
apply
in
a
situation
where
the
union
is
not
seeking
initial
recognition.
in
other
words,
if
it
already
has
a
contract
or
a
bargaining
history,
then
it
can...
then
it
can
picket
for
recognition
beyond
30
days.
however,
the
board
said
that
they
will
not
allow
that
affirmative
defense
where
the
recognition
is
not
based
on
majority
status.
therefore,
the
issue
of
majority
versus
minority
status
was
joined
in
that
case.
and
the
board
relied
on
its
r.j.
smith
decisions
and
its
decisions
under
section
8(a)(5)
of
the
act.
and
the
d.c.
circuit
again
reversed,
and
that's
how
it
came
before
this
court.
and
as
is
shown
by
the
petition
and
briefs
to
the
court
by
the
board,
this
court
passed
not
only
on
the
8(b)(7)
issue
but
it,
in
order
to
reach
that
issue,
it
had
to
go
back
and
pass
on
the
board's
position
in
section
8(a)(5),
and
it
commented
on
the
board's
decision
in
r.j.
smith.
and
it
also
commented
on
and
passed
favorably
upon
the
board's
decision
that
minority
pre-hire
agreements
are
not
enforceable
unless
the
union
obtains
majority
support.
now,
the
board
rule
is
basically
that,
when
a
union
obtains
majority,
the
pre-hire
agreement
is
enforceable.
until
then
it
is
not.
and
you
have
to
look
both
at
the
r.j.
smith
decision
and
also
look
to
the
board's
brief
to
find
out
the
reasons
for
its
policy.
basically,
it
limits
the
purposes
of
the
statute...
excuse
me,
it
limits
the
adaptation
of
the
statute
to
its
purposes.
in
other
words,
once
an
employer
obtains
union
members
from
the
union
hiring
hall,
the
skilled
pool
of
employees,
then
the
union
will
normally
obtain
majority
status,
and
the
agreement
is
therefore
enforceable.
in
situations
where
they
do
not
obtain
that...
do
not
use
that
pool
and
the
union
does
not
obtain
majority
status,
then
the
agreement
is
not
enforceable.
now,
it
is
very
important
to
look
at
the
basic
reasons
behind
the
board's
decision.
this
court
and
the
board
has
said
that
the
voluntary
compliance
of
section
8(f)
agreements,
of
minority
section
8(f)
agreements,
is
not
itself
unlawful
and
has
said
it's
all
right.
now,
the
reasons
for
that
is
not
that
the
voluntary
compliance
of
the
pre-hire
agreement
is
itself
good
for
employees.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
voluntary
compliance
of
minority
pre-hire
agreements
is
in
itself
inconsistent
with
employee
rights.
it's
just
because
of
this
accommodation
to
the
particular
needs
of
the
construction
industry
that
it
has
allowed
this
exception.
and
that
is
why
the
board
said
in
r.j.
smith
that
the
record
revealed
an
irresponsibly
imposed
minority
representation.
now,
you
might
wonder
why
did
the
board
say
that
when
there
is
no
specific
findings
that
any
employee
was
disadvantaged
by
that.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
i
also
did
respond
to
that
in
my
reply
brief.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
okay.
it's
about
the
last
four
or
five
pages
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that
is
correct.
under
the
board's
position,
yes.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
i
don't
believe
so.
just
because
the
board
and
the
courts
say
that
voluntary
compliance
is
all
right.
in
other
words,
they
haven't
violated
any
law
and
they
have
complied.
and
the
board
has
also
said
they
can
unilaterally
make
changes.
they
can
apply
some
and
not
to
others.
in
fact,
in
r.j.
smith
for
a
certain
period
of
time
it
did
make
payments
in
the
trust
fund
on
a
few
of
the
union
employees,
but
those
employees
were
still
the
minority.
there
are
several
things
to
note
about
your
situation
that
may
seem
inequitable
at
first
blush
that
employers
can
wait
until
that
point
in
time.
but
often,
as
the
board
noted
in
higdon,
an
employer
engages
in
two
job
sites
at
the
same
time,
one
using
the
pre-hire
agreement
and
one
not.
and
under
the
ninth
circuit's
notice
of
repudiation
rule,
it's
really
an
all-or-nothing
situation.
i
have
many
clients
that
engage
in
that
type
of
activity.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
the
entire
agreement
is
unenforceable
in
the
board's
position.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that's
right.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
and
it's
because
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
employee
rights
just
to
in
effect
recognize
a
minority
union.
and
it
is
only
enforceable
up
to
a
point
in
time.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
position
taken
by
respondents
and
the
position
taken
by
the
court
below
would
in
effect
reverse
the
board's
r.j.
smith
decision.
the
board's
r.j.
smith
decision
would
not
be
enforced
under
either
interpretation,
because
there
is
no
notice
of
repudiation
and
there
is
no
election
result.
the
respondents
do
cite
a
couple
of
cases
in
support
of
their
position
that...
they
contend
that
the
board
supports
their
position,
and
they
cite
one
8(b)(7)
case
and
they
cite
also
another
representation
case.
i
responded
to
both
of
those
cases
in
my
reply
brief.
but
it
is
important
to
note
that
respondents
did
not
go
to
the
very
issue,
the
enforceability
of
pre-hire
agreements,
which
are
contained
in
section
8(a)(5)
cases.
in
my
reply
brief
i
cited
13
nlrb
section
8(a)(5)
cases
in
response
to
the
position
cited
by
respondents.
now,
i
noted
that
the
position
taken
by
respondents
the...
would
in
effect
reverse
the
r.j.
smith
decision,
would
in
effect
reverse
the
ruttmann
decision,
would
reverse
certain
parts
of
the
corrugated
structures
decision
and
other
decisions
by
the
board.
there
are
also
some...
one
point
to
be
considered
is
that
employees
do
not
necessarily
have
any
detriment
by
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner
herein
or
by
the
board.
in
r.j.
smith,
of
course,
the
board
said
as
a
matter
of
law,
employees
receive
a
certain
detriment
because
of
court
enforcement
and
board
enforcement
of
the
decision.
also,
in
the
ruttmann
decision,
which
was
a
companion
to
the
r.j.
smith
and
also
noted
by
this
court,
the
employees
actually
receive
higher
wages
and
higher
fringe
benefits
rather
than
under
the
pre-hire
agreement
of
the
other
union.
also,
in
the--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
a
few
more
points
i
would
like
to
make.
i
keep
on
referring
to
the
board's
r.j.
smith
decision
because
it
is
the
basis
of
the
board's
policy
and
it
sets
out
the
board's
policy
in
total.
it
is
very
important
to
note
that
not
only
did
respondent
not
rely
on
section
8(a)(5)
cases
in
its
brief,
it
did
not
even
cite
in
its
entire
brief
the
r.j.
smith
decision.
it
is
completely
avoiding
the
board's
position
on
these
matters.
now,
this
court
in
higdon
also
pointed
out
the
very
issue
of
the
enforceability
of
minority
agreements
in
301
litigation
which
was
raised
in
the
afl-cio
brief
and
by
the
board
in
its
reply
brief.
and
this
court
in
higdon
stated
that
301...
in
301
litigation
minority
status
may
be
litigated
just
as
it
is
in
an--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
james
t.
winkler
i
disagree.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be,
because
the...
okay...
they
went
in
the
r.j.
smith
decision,
they
went
all
the
way
back
and
found
that
there
was
no
enforceable
agreement,
and
also
they...
it
was
not...
excuse
me,
there
is
no
notice
of
repudiation
in
r.j.
smith.
the
government
distinction
is
very
simple.
it
simply
says
that
that
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
and
this
is
a
301
litigation.
and
that
i
think
was
discussed
and
resolved
in
the
higdon
decision
itself.
and
also,
it
goes
right
back
to
the
howard
johnson
case
that
says
the
basic
policies
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
should
not
be...
should
also
be
controlling
in
a
301
case.
now,
the
entire
line
of
cases
along
there,
howard
johnson,
were
really
ignored
by
the
government
in
its
case.
it
just
gave
a
blanket
statement.
the
two
are
completely
separate.
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
my
reply
brief,
you
will
see
that
the
entire
history
from
lincoln
mill
and
howard
johnson
on
up
to
higdon
itself
says
you
just
cannot
ignore
the
basic
policies
in
unfair
labor
practice
context.
now
the
litmus
test
to
be
applied
here
is
the
basic
polices.
and
if
you
look
at
those
board
cases
i
cite
in
my
reply
brief,
all
13
of
them,
you
will
find
that
in
those
cases
where
the
statutory
policies
were
intendedly
applied,
the
contract
was
enforced.
when
the
employer
went
to
the
union
hall
and
got
union
employees,
the
contract
was
enforced.
and
when
it
was...
the
employer
used
non-union
employees
on
non-union
job
sites,
the
contract
was
not
enforced
because
that's
against
public
policy.
you
should
also
look,
i
believe,
at
the
board's
land
equipment
case,
which
i
cited
in
my
reply
brief.
respondents
also
were
involved
in
that
case.
the
trust
funds
intervened
in
the
board
proceedings.
now,
in
that
case
the
idea
of
voidability...
a
repudiation
rule
was
brought
up
before
the
board,
and
the
board
again
rejected
it
specifically.
and
the
board
did
find
majority
status
in
that
case.
the
union
did...
excuse
me,
the
employer
did
go
to
the
union
hall,
got
employees,
and
the
employers
are
bound
to
honor
the
agreement.
however,
it
is
only
bound
to
honor
the
agreement
that
to
a
point
in
time
when
the
union
first
obtained
majority
status.
the
board
disagreed
with
the
administrative
law
judge
in
that
case,
which
gave
it
retroactive
enforcement
even
before
that
period
of
time.
now,
that
case
was
enforced
by
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
i
didn't
cite
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
it
was
just
a
memorandum
opinion
at
649
f.
2d
867.
so
what
you
have
here
is
the
ninth
circuit
in
an
unfair-practice
context
enforcing
this
contract
back
to
the
point
in
time
when
they
had
majority
but
not
before.
but
in
the
301
context
the
same
court
would
enforce
that
contract
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning
because
there
was
no
notice
of
repudiation.
now,
getting
to
the
issue
of
the
trust
funds
involved
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
under
section
306(a)
there
is
some
special
reason
that
they
shouldn't
be
bound
to
the
same
rules
by
the
nlrb.
let
me
just
point
out
one
case
i
cited
in
my
brief,
the
district
court
case
of
sorrenton
pointed
out
in
the
minority
agreement,
it's
really
for
the
employees
to
decide
whether
they
want
the
contract
and
that
includes
trust
fund
benefits.
and
the
court
would
be
second-guessing
those
wishes
of
the
employees
if
they
in
fact
gave
them
trust
fund
benefits
or
put
the...
put
the
entire
contract
into
effect.
and
it
pointed
out
also
that
trust
fund
payments
to
benefit...
to
employees
is
not
necessarily
a
benefit
to
them,
it
may
take
away
from
the
ability
of
the
employer
to
give
other--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--i
notice
the
distinction
in
the
language
there.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
they're
talking
about
there.
i
notice
in...
in
higdon
itself,
this
court
was
careful
to
use
the
term
"pre-hire
agreement"--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--oh,
i
would
say
not.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
the
idea
of
collectively--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--collectively
bargained
assumes
that
the--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--that'd
be--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--the
idea
of
collective
bargaining
assumes
the
idea
that
they're
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
employees,
as
the
collective
bargaining
agent
for
those
employees.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
i
do
not
believe
that
they
did.
i
notice
in
the
original
senate
version
they
also
had
the
words
"collectively
bargained".
i
believe
they
also
said...
made
a
reference
to
a
308(a).
and
that's
pointed
out
in
my
reply
brief.
but
i
would
note
that
the
sorrenson
decision
has
some
practical
effect
in
the
board's
deangelo
and
kahn
decision,
which
is
also
cited
in
my
reply
brief.
the
only
issue
in
deangelo
and
kahn
are
really
the
trust
fund
payments.
the
employer
voluntarily
complied
with
the
agreement
on
one
job
site,
but
then
on
another
job
site
it
gave
what
it
would
have
been
the
trust
fund
payments,
it
gave
that
extra
amount
to
the
employees
in
additional
take-home
pay.
it
was
a
federally
funded
project,
and
therefore,
under
the
davis-bacon
act
they
had
to
pay
a
certain
amount,
and
that
amount
was
the
same
as
the
overall
union
contract.
so
the
employees
actually
got
a
greater
take-home
pay
under
that
arrangement.
so
it's
not
like
the
employees
necessarily...
it's
basically
for
the
employees
to
decide
what
they
want,
and
if
they
have
not
chosen
the
union,
the
union
contracts
do
not
apply.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
basically,
if
the...
if
the
unions...
if
it
is
not
established
that
the
union
represents
the
majority
of
the
employees,
then
the
contract
is
not
enforceable.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
they
have
to,
in
effect,
give
a
notice
of
repudiation.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
basically,
if
they
say
not.
they
say
it
can
be
an
open
and
notorious,
and
that
would,
in
effect,
give
notice.
but
they
have
said
that
that
did
not
occur
here.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that's
true.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that's
true.
that's
my
view.
that's
also
the
board's
view.
what
we
have
here
is
basically--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--well,
the
general
counsel
and
the
board--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--are
not
one
and
the
same.
i
don't
mean
that
lightly.
i
mean
i
do
not
believe
that
is
an
accurate
representation
of
the
board.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that's
true.
that's
right
in
the
statute.
and
i
do
not
think
that
it's
an
accurate
representation
of
the
board.
i
might
add,
if
you
compare
the
brief
of
the
general
counsel...
excuse
me,
of
the
government
in
this
case
with
the
brief
of
the
board
given
in
higdon,
they
do
not
match
at
all.
they
are
totally
inconsistent,
and
they
are
totally
contrary
to
each
other.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
oh,
it
should
be
given
some
weight,
but
then
again
i
think
you
should
take
a
look
at
the
board
decisions
itself.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
i
can't
say
that.
i
don't
think
that
he's
speaking
for
the
board.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that's
right.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
well--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--in
higdon
the
brief
was
on
behalf
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
i
know.
but
in
higdon
the
brief
was--
mr.
james
t.
winkler
--filed
on
behalf
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
that's
correct.
and
you
might
as
well
take
the
higdon
brief
and,
you
know,
change
the
caption
and
sign
my
name
to
it.
i
mean
i
am
just
adopting
exactly
what
the
board
is
saying
all
the
way
through.
mr.
james
t.
winkler
yes,
it
did.
i
might
point
out
that
under
306(a),
i
pointed
out
a
few
things
in
my...
in
my
reply
argument.
one
thing
i
would
especially
like
the
court
to
look
at
is
that
in...
i
believe
that
the
issue
raised
was
also
resolved
by
kaiser
where
this
court
said
that
defenses,
labor
law
defenses,
are
not
implicitly
repealed.
and
i
think
that
settles
the
matter.
also,
in
this
matter
you
might
take
a
look...
this
is
really
probably
not
even
a
defense.
there's
a
question
whether
or
not
this
is
even
a
defense
here
if
the
entire
agreement
is
not
enforceable.
also,
i
think
the
initial
premise,
and
i
request
you
to
take
a
good
look
at
my
reply
brief
on
this,
the
initial
premise
was
that
the
legislative
history
in
the
committee
print
was
to
301(a).
it
was
to
301(a)
and
to
(b).
and
the
entire
section
taken
together
shows
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
set
up
a
statutory
right
and
to
give...
so
that
you
can
give
certain
remedies.
and
it's
set
forth
in
(b)
all
the
remedies
that
you
can
give.
you've
got
attorney's
fees,
you
have
liquidated
damages,
you
have
extra
interest
rates.
it's
really
quite
a
penalty.
the
government...
thank
you,
your
honor.
