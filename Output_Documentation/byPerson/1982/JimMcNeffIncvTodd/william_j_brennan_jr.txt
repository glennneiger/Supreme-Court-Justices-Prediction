mr.
winkler,
306(a),
the
language
there
is
collectively
bargained
agreement.
now,
is
there
a
difference
between
a
collectively
bargained
agreement
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
clearly
enough,
a
pre-hire
agreement
is
not
yet
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
may
it
not
be
a
collectively
bargained
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
they
sat
down
and
bargained,
even
though
it
was
a
minority
pre-hire
agreement,
isn't
that--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--collectively
bargained
even
if
it's
not
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
congressmen...
congress
chose
that
language,
"collectively
bargained
agreement",
purposely
to
indicate
maybe
a
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
what
do
you
suggest
is
the
reason
that
that
erisa
amendment
speaks
for
the
collectively
bargained
agreement
rather
than
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
different
thing
than
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
they
may
be
collectively
bargained
even
if
not
collective
bargaining
agreements?
