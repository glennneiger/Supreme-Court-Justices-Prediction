justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
kitching,
when
you
say
that
california
relied
solely
on
state
law,
is
that
true
of
your
declaratory...
prayer
for
declaratory
relief,
as
well
as
your
prayer
that
the
taxes
be...
judgment
be
given?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
realize
that
statute
gave
you
the
procedural
vehicle
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
but
what
was
the
substance
of
your
claim
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
there
had
been
no
preemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did...
i
suppose
in
that
part
of
your
prayer
for
a
declaratory
judgment
you
had
to
discuss
some
federal
authorities?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
in
your
prayer,
perhaps,
and
perhaps
not
in
the
allegations
of
your
complaint.
but
did
you
file
a
memorandum
of
supporting
authorities
along
with
the
complaint
on
a
motion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
trying
to...
i
suppose
everybody
would
concede
that
if
your
claim
had
simply
been
that,
you
owe
us
the
taxes
because
california
statute
xyz
says
you
do,
give
us
judgment,
that
there
is
no...
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine,
there
is
no
raising
of
a
federal
question.
but
i'm
wondering
whether
when
you
add
to
that
a
declaratory
judgment
prayer
you
don't,
based
on
preemption,
you
don't
perhaps
raise
a
federal
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
watson,
perhaps
congress
thought
that
tax
laws
weren't
preempted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
differently
from
pension
trusts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
answer
the
propriety
of
removal
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
suppose
there's
any
doubt
that,
had
the
trustees
sought
to
sue,
they
could
have
found
some
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction.
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
propriety
of
removal
on
the
basis
of
the
state's
complaint.
