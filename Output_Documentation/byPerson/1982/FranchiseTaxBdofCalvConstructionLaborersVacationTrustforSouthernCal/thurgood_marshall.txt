justice
thurgood
marshall
could
the
state
have
filed
this
action
in
the
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
what
grounds?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
301
get
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
complaint
allege
anything
about
301?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
asked
could
this
complaint
have
been
filed
in
a
federal
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
originally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
on
what
basis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
would
agree
to
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'd
have
been
in
there
fighting
just
like
you're
fighting
now,
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
watson,
suppose
the
trust
fund
didn't
pay
its
property
tax.
would
that
be
a
federal
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir,
on
the
building
it
owned.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
reason
it
has
a
defense
is...
well,
let
me
try.
they
didn't
pay
the
property
tax
and
they
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
this
was
an
agreement
they
had
and
all.
would
that
change
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they're
trying
to
take
assets
of
the
fund.
they're
trying
to
get
their
taxes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
both
cases
they're
trying
to
get
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
couldn't
take
the
property
taxes
out
of
that
money
if
there
was
no
other
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
said
"may".
it
didn't
say
they
had
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
