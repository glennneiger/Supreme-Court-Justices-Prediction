you
feel
that
that
is
a
precedent
for
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
is
a
high
public
service,
collection
of
taxes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
there
are
other
means
of
collecting
taxes,
aren't
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
withholding
in
california?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that
was
insufficient
in
these
cases?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
ask
that
because
you
emphasize
the
transient
character
of
these
workers.
normally,
withholding
would
catch
those
that
do
opt,
if
they're
in
there
for
just
a
short
time
and
then
go
out
and
leave
the
state.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
just
a
test
case,
of
course,
but
the
great
sum
of
$308
or
something
like
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
if
we
were
to
vacate
and
remand
this
case
on
your
jurisdictional
approach,
that
doesn't
mean
you've
necessarily
won
it
in
state
court,
does
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
actually,
you
won
it
at
the
district
court
level
on
the
federal
side.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you're
complaining
now
because
you
got
tipped
over
in
the
court
of
appeals.
