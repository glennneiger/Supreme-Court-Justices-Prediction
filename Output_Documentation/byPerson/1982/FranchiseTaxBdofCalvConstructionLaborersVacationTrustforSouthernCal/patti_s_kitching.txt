ms.
patti
s.
kitching
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case
today.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
district
court
ever
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
this
action--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--yes.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
california
tax
collection
statute
has
been
preempted
by
the
provisions
of
the
employee
income
security
act
of
1974,
otherwise
known
as
erisa.
this
lawsuit
began
because
various
taxpayers
were
indebted
to
the
state
of
california
for
income
tax.
there
is
no
question
in
this
lawsuit
concerning
the
validity
of
those
taxes.
these
various
taxpayers
were
employed
as
laborers
in
the
construction
industry
and
were
participants
in
a
vacation
plan
covered
by
selected
provisions
of
erisa.
the
employers
of
these
workers
funded
the
vacation
plan
by
contributing
a
certain
amount
per
hour
to
the
fund
for
each
employee.
the
vacation
fund
paid
out
periodically
the
amount
owing
to
each
employee.
in
order
to
collect
these
workers'
delinquent
income
taxes,
the
franchise
tax
board
of
the
state
of
california
served
what
is
called
an
order
to
withhold
on
the
trustees
of
the
vacation
plan.
this
order
to
withhold
is
a
type
of
levy
authorized
by
the
california
statute.
the
trustees
refused
to
honor
the
levy,
alleging
that
the
california
statute
had
been
preempted
by
erisa.
the
franchise
tax
board
filed
suit
in
los
angeles
superior
court
to
enforce
their
levy
and
to
obtain
a
declaration
that
future
levies
should
be
honored.
the
trustees
removed
the
case
to
federal
court.
the
franchise
tax
board
brought
a
motion
to
remand,
which
was
denied.
the
district
court
found
on
the
merits
for
the
franchise
tax
board,
that
the
statute
had
not
been
preempted.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
found
that
the
statute
was
preempted.
one
member
of
the
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
dissented.
he
found:
first
of
all,
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction;
and
secondly,
that
the
statute
had
not
been
preempted.
before
we
discuss
the
merits
of
preemption,
it
is
necessary
to
first
discuss
the
issue
of
whether
the
district
court
ever
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
this
action.
california
brought
this
action
in
state
court
and
relied
solely
on
state
law
to
collect
the
delinquent
taxes.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
a
state
declaratory
relief
action.
we
rely...
statute,
pardon
me.
we
relied
on
that
statute
to
bring
our
action.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
we
wanted
them
to
honor
future
levies
and
we
alleged
that
their
defense
of
preemption
as
to
why
they
were
not
honoring
our
levies
was
not
a
valid
defense.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
well,
not
necessarily
in
my
prayer
i
didn't
discuss--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--no,
your
honor.
we
only
filed
the
complaint
in
state
court.
that
complaint
was
removed
to
district
court.
am
i
understanding
your
question?
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
no,
i
don't
believe
we
do
under
the
authority
of
this
court,
because
that's
only
anticipating
what
the
defense
of
the
defendant
was
going
to
be,
which
was
going
to
be
based
on
federal
law.
the
franchise
tax
board
was
not
relying
on
federal
law
for
its
cause
of
action
or
for
its
remedy.
it
was
relying
solely
on
state
law.
the
only
way
that
federal
law
entered
the
case
was
by
the
defense
of
the
defendant,
and
the
franchise
tax
board
simply
anticipated
that
defense,
and
under
the
authorities
of
this
court--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--yes,
the
complaint
set
out
the
position
of
the
trustees.
but
again,
that
was
simply
their
defense
to
the
state
cause
of
action.
the
state
was
not
relying
on
erisa
for
anything
in
this
case.
erisa
entered
the
case
as
a
defense,
and
under
the
authorities
of
this
court
anticipating
the
defendant's
defense
does
not
create
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
we
did
not
need
federal
law
to
collect
our
taxes
or
to
receive
a
declaratory
judgment
under
california
law.
as
i
said,
the
trustees
relied
on
erisa
as
a
defense
to
the
california
causes
of
action.
and
again,
as
i
said,
this
court
has
held
for
many
years
that
this
defense
does
not
create
federal
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
the
trustees
argue
that
they
could
have
brought
the
action
in
federal
court.
however,
there
are
problems
with
this
allegation.
first
of
all,
they
did
not
do
that;
and
second
of
all,
any
action
that
they
would
have
brought
in
federal
court
would
have
been
barred
by
the
provisions
of
28
u.s.c.
1341,
the
tax
injunction
act,
which
declares
that
no
district
court
shall
enjoin
the
collection
of
the
tax
where
there
is
a
plain,
speedy
and
efficient
remedy
in
state
court.
this
case
should
have
been
remanded
to
state
court.
that
court
was
competent
to
decide
whether
erisa
preempts
the
california
statute.
if
the
trustees
did
not
prevail
in
the
california
state
court,
they
had
the
option
of
pursuing
this
matter
ultimately
to
this
court.
assuming
for
a
moment
that
jurisdiction
did
exist,
the
second--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--well,
it's
the
position
of
the
franchise
tax
board
that
the
trustees
could
have
defended
in
the
lawsuit
which
had
been
brought
against
them.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
no.
actually,
we
feel
they
could
have
brought
an
action,
too.
had
they
paid
the
money
over,
they
could
have
filed
a
claim
with
the
state
board
of
control,
and
if
that
claim
were
denied
then
they
would
have
the
right
to
bring
an
independent
action
against
the
franchise
tax
board
for
conversion
and
litigate
whether
they
should
have
turned
over
their
funds.
so
we
feel
they
had
adequate
remedies
at
state
law.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
because--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--because
of
28
u.s.c.
1341.
they
clearly
would
have
been
enjoining
the
collection
of
a
tax.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
the
trustees
have
argued
that
erisa
gives
them--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--a
statutory--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--if
they
can
use
a
statute
under
erisa,
they
probably
have
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
going
to
the
principles
of
preemption,
as
this
court
has
stated
many
times
preemption
is
not
lightly
to
be
presumed.
and
regarding
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
california
to
collect
the
revenue,
that
power
should
not
be
preempted
unless
that
was
the
clear
and
manifest
intent
of
congress.
erisa
is
primarily
pension
legislation.
it
comprehensively
regulates
pensions
and
mandates
that
those
benefits
will
not
be
alienated.
by
contrast,
it
only
regulates
welfare
plans
in
the
areas
of
recording
and
disclosure,
fiduciary
responsibility,
and
administration
and
enforcement;
and
it
does
not
mandate
a
non-alienation
provision.
the
vacation
plan
at
issue
in
this
case
is
a
welfare
plan
and
not
a
pension
plan.
erisa's
preemption
provision
is
section
514.
it
provides
that
the
provisions
of
titles
i
and
iv
of
erisa
shall
supersede
any
and
all
state
laws
insofar
as
they
relate
to
any
benefit
plan
described.
the
term
"state"
includes
governmental
entities
which
purport
to
regulate,
directly
or
indirectly,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
benefit
plans.
the
franchise
tax
board
contends
that
preemption
under
514
is
not
limitless.
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
preempt
all
state
laws
which
incidentally
touch
erisa
plans.
it
is
more
reasonable
to
conclude
that
congress
only
meant
to
preempt
state
laws
that
regulated
in
the
same
areas
as
erisa
or
that
interfered
with
the
purposes
of
erisa.
this
interpretation
is
supported
by
the
comments
of
representative
john
dent
and
senator
harrison
williams,
who
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
preemption
clause
was
to
eliminate
the
threat
of
conflicting
or
inconsistent
state
and
local
regulation
of
employee
benefit
plans.
the
california
statute
does
not
relate
to
vacation
plans.
it
does
not
regulate
or
mandate
the
terms
and
conditions
of
any
plan.
it
does
not
conflict
with
the
purposes
of
erisa.
the
preemption
section
has
recently
been
amended.
the
background
of
this
amendment
begins
with
certain
hawaii
statutes
that
required
employers
in
hawaii
to
provide
health
insurance
benefits
for
their
employees.
these
laws
were
challenged
by
an
employer
in
the
case
of
standard
oil
versus
agsalud,
where
the
employer
argued
that
the
health
insurance
laws
were
preempted
by
erisa.
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
and
this
court
affirmed.
in
order
to
save
the
concept
of
the
hawaii
law,
which
was
that
all
employees
in
the
state
of
hawaii
be
provided
with
health
insurance
by
their
employers,
congress
amended
section
514.
this
amendment
exempts
hawaii's
health
insurance
plan
from
preemption
and
states
that
nothing
in
the
new
exemption
shall
be
construed
to
exempt
from
preemption
any
state
tax
law
relating
to
employee
benefit
plans.
the
words
514(a)(5),
which
deals
exclusively
with
the
hawaii
problem.
the
words
must
also
be
interpreted
within
the
context
of
the
agsalud
case,
where
hawaii
unsuccessfully
argued
that
the
payment
required
from
the
employer
was
a
tax.
the
words
"tax
law"
in
the
amendment
were
apparently
a
response
to
what
hawaii
was
attempting
to
classify
as
a
tax.
the
complete
section
514,
the
only
place
i
believe
it's
set
out
in
any
of
the
briefs
is
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
state
of
connecticut
on
pages
10
and
11,
which
sets
out
the
former
section
514
and
the
amendment,
which
are
sections
(5)
and
(6).
the
only
pertinent
comment
in
regard
to
tax
laws
in
the
legislative
history
with
regard
to
the
amendment
comes
from
senator
dole,
who
stated
that
the
amendment
was
intended
to
exempt
hawaii's
health
plan
from
preemption,
but
preclude
hawaii
from
imposing
tax
liability
on
insurance
premiums
or
benefits.
if
senator
dole's
comment
on
tax
laws
is
the
reason
why
the
words
"tax
law"
appear
in
the
amendment,
then
the
california
statute
does
not
fall
within
the
real
of
senator
dole's
concern.
moreover,
there
is
evidence
that
the
hawaii
amendment
did
not
change
the
scope
of
section
514.
according
to
the
senate
committee
on
finance,
the
amendment
"does
not
affect
the
status
under
the
preemption
provisions
of
erisa
of
any
state
tax
law
relating
to
employee
benefit
plans.
"
in
addition,
the
conference
report
explained
that
the
amendment
continues
preemption
of
state
law
"with
respect
to
matters
governed
by
the
reporting
and
disclosure
and
the
fiduciary
responsibility
provisions
of
erisa,
as
well
as
certain
provisions
of
the
administration
and
enforcement
rules
of
erisa.
"
if
the
amendment
is
interpreted
within
the
context
of
the
agsalud
case
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
hawaii
amendment,
then
the
words
514.
it
must
also
be
noted
that
the
amendment
again
uses
the
words
"relate
to".
the
california
statute
did
not
relate
to
benefit
plans
either
before
or
after
the
hawaii
amendment.
with
these
facts
in
mind,
it
is
clear
that
the
california
statute
is
not
affected
by
this
amendment.
the
domestic
relations
cases
have
shown
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
courts
to
define
the
limits
of
erisa's
preemption.
where
courts
have
found
a
high
public
purpose,
they
have
interpreted
the
preemption
section
accordingly.
in
the
area
of
domestic
relations,
almost
all
courts
which
have
considered
the
problem
have
allowed
ex-spouses
and
children
to
levy
on
pension
funds
for
the
collection
of
family
maintenance
or
community
property
rights.
this
is--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--we
feel
that
we
also
have
a
high
public
purpose,
yes,
we
do.
we
feel
that
if
the
domestic--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--certainly,
your
honor,
the
collection
of
taxes,
which
are
the
lifeblood
of
government.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
state
has
the
ability
to
use
all
of
its
cumulative
remedies.
the
state
must
be
allowed
to
use
each
of
the
remedies
which
it
possesses.
sometimes
it
cannot
use
its
other
remedies,
and
this
may
be
the
only
one
that
it
has
left
to
it.
as
in
this
case,
where
we're
dealing
with
transient
workers,
this
may
be
the
only
remedy
that
the
state
has
to
collect
this
outstanding
income
tax.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
the
state
of
california
does
not
have
the
same
purpose,
of
course,
as
the
ex-spouse
and
children.
however,
it
does
have
a
high
public
purpose,
and
the
point
we
are
showing
is
that
when
there
is
a
high
public
purpose
there
are
exceptions
to
erisa
and
the
preemption
does
not
cover
those
areas
where
the
state
can
show
that
it
has
a
high
public
purpose,
and
that
congress
would
not
intend
to
preempt
that
state
law.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
your
honor.
in
these
cases,
some
of
them
were
by
assessment
a
certain
amount
would
have
been
withheld
and
that
would
not
have
covered
the
ultimate
tax
liability,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
well,
in
some
cases
it
would,
your
honor.
in
not
all
cases,
however,
did
it
cover
their
tax
liability.
sometimes
there
are
assessments
after
the
return
is
filed
and
there's
an
audit
and
it's
determined
that
the
taxpayer
owes
more
money.
perhaps
it
hasn't
withheld
enough
money
to
cover
his
tax
liability.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
that's
right,
your
honor.
however,
there
are
over
400,000
people
who
belong
to
vacation
trusts
in
california,
and
millions
of
dollars
per
year
are
contributed
by
the
employers
into
these
accounts.
in
this
case
the
department
of
labor
has
provided
its
opinion
that
the
california
statute
has
been
preempted.
however,
this
opinion
is
of
little
assistance
because
it
simply
cites
sections
of
erisa
and
the
trust
agreement
and
comes
to
the
conclusion,
with
no
legal
analysis.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
department
of
labor
supports
an
preemption
for
domestic
relations
law.
apparently
within
the
context
of
domestic
relations
laws
they
are
not
concerned
with
erisa's
preemption
section,
the
fiduciary
responsibility
section,
or
the
anti-alienation
provisions.
these
are
the
very
sections
which
the
department
of
labor
relies
upon
to
preclude
the
board's
levy.
however,
if
these
sections
are
not
effective
as
to
domestic
relations
laws,
the
franchise
tax
board
contends
they
should
not
be
effective
as
to
state
collection
laws.
in
conclusion,
the
franchise
tax
board
does
not
regulate
nor
relate
to
this
vacation
plan.
there
is
no
tax
being
imposed
on
the
fund
itself.
there
is
no
tax
being
imposed
on
the
benefits
paid.
there
is
no
tax
being
imposed
on
the
employer.
the
money
is
in
the
fund
and
it
belongs
to
the
taxpayer.
it
has
been
levied
upon
to
satisfy
old
tax
liabilities.
if
the
trustees
prevail
in
their
argument
that
all
terms
in
a
vacation
plan
are
protected
from
state
law
by
erisa's
preemption
section,
then
there
is
no
end
to
the
trust's
ability
to
exempt
itself
and
the
assets
of
its
participants
from
any
valid
state
law
or
any
other
state
law.
if
the
trust
provisions
can
prohibit
california
from
levying
on
a
vacation
plan,
could
they
also
provide
that
one-half
of
the
participants'
wages
should
be
considered
vacation
pay
and
not
subject
to
state
tax
or
withholding
at
all?
under
the
argument
of
the
trustee,
that
is
what
could
happen.
it
is
clear
that
the
district
court
never
had
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
furthermore,
with
regard
to
erisa,
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
interfere
with
the
california
revenue
collection
statutes,
which
do
not
regulate
the
terms
or
conditions
of
an
erisa
plan
or
interfere
with
the
purposes
of
erisa.
your
honors,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
you're
correct,
your
honor.
it
should
be
heard
in
state
court--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--yes.
yes,
we
did
win
at
the
district
court
level,
your
honor.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
yes,
we
are.
it
would
start
over
in
the
state
court,
your
honors,
similar
to
the
grace
brethren
case
which
you
had
last
season.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
have
a
few
brief
remarks
in
the
area
of
jurisdiction.
the
adequate
remedy
principle
doesn't
provide
that
they
should
be
able
to
challenge
the
tax,
but
whether
they
can
litigate
the
issue
of
preemption
in
the
state
court.
it
is
our
contention
that
they
could
have
litigated
that
issue
of
preemption
in
a
defensive
manner
in
the
lawsuit
which
we
already
brought
against
them.
they
could
have
raised
the
issue
of
preemption.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
well,
we're
not
talking
about
where
they're
bringing
the
lawsuit.
we're
talking
about
where
they're
defending
the
lawsuit.
and
this
court
has
held
a
state--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
this
court
has
held
many
times
the
state
courts
are
perfectly
capable
and
they're
mandated
to
consider
federal
questions.
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
we
agree
that
it
has
not
changed
anything
under
erisa
and
that
whatever
was--
ms.
patti
s.
kitching
--we
don't
think
the
statute
has
changed
anything.
we
think
if
something
was
not
preempted
before
1982
it
is
not
preempted
now.
if
it
was
preempted
before
it
is
still
preempted.
however,
the
state
of
california
contends
that
their
levy
does
not
relate
to
a
vacation
trust
and
therefore
wouldn't
be
preempted
either
before
or
after
the
amendment.
just
one
further
point.
the
adequate
remedy
principle
does
not
mean
that
they
can
litigate
the
validity
of
the
tax,
but
only
if
they
could
litigate
the
same
issue
that
they
could
have
litigated
in
federal
court,
and
here
that
would
be
the
issue
of
preemption.
and
this
court
has
found
that
state
courts
are
perfectly
capable
of
deciding
any
federal
issues
and
they
are
bound
to
do
just
that.
thank
you
very
much.
