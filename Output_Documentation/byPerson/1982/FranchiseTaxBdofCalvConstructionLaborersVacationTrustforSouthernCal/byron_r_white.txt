justice
byron
r.

well,
what
if
the
trustees
had
gone
to
the
federal
court
in
the
first
place,
beat
you
to
the
courthouse,
and
wanted
a
declaratory
judgment
that
erisa
did
preempt
your
tax
scheme?
do
you
think
there
would
have
been
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aside
from
that
provision,
would
there
have
been
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
go
in
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--their
claim,
their
federal
claim,
is
that
erisa
preempts.
that's
their
sole
claim
in
federal
court.
it
may
be
thrown
out
under
the
injunction
act,
but
otherwise
there
would
be
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
all
these
events
occurred
after
1982?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
'82
amendment
just
confirmed
the
meaning
of
the
prior
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
it
says.
it
really...
it
just
didn't
disturb
whatever
the
law
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
didn't
really
change,
the
'82
amendment--
justice
byron
r.
white
--didn't
purport
to
change
what
the
law
was
or
anything
of
the
kind.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
the
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
your
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
sort
of
like
in
antitrust,
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
antitrust
cases,
and
i
take
it
state
courts
haven't
got
any
jurisdiction.
i
might,
before
you
sit
down:
you're
lucky
that
your
brief
was
filed
in
this
court.
i
didn't
see
a
summary
in
your
brief,
and
i
thought
our
rules
provided
for
a
summary.
usually
briefs
get
sent
back
if
they
don't
have
a
summary,
but
you
were
just
lucky.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
about
502(a)(3),
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
was
congress'
intention,
then,
to
reserve
those
kinds
of
considerations
for
a
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
say
about
the
'82
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument,
then,
after...
or
would
you,
after
'82?
