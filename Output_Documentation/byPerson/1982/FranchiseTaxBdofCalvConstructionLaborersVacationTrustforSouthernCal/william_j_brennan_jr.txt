justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
for
announcement
the
decision
on
82-695,
franchise
tax
board
versus
the
construction
laborers
union.
the
principal
question
in
dispute
between
the
parties
to
that
appeal,
which
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
is
whether
the
employee
retirement
income
security
act
(erisa),
previously
mentioned
by
my
brother
blackmun,
permits
state
tax
authorities
to
collect
unpaid
state
income
taxes
by
levying
on
funds
held
in
trust
for
the
taxpayers
under
an
erisa-covered
vacation
benefit
plan.
we
don't,
however,
decide
the
question.
that's
because
we
hold
that
the
lower
federal
courts
had
no
jurisdiction
to
address
or
decide.
we
therefore
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court
from
which
it
was
removed.
our
reasons
are
set
forth
at
length.
in
an
opinion
filed
to
the
clerk,
that
decision
was
unanimous.
