well,
but
didn't
the
complaint
itself,
though,
refer
to
the
question
about
whether
erisa
preempted
the
levy
and
referred
to
the
position
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
taken
by
the
trust
fund,
the
trustees?
justice
sandra

before
we
leave
jurisdiction,
for
the
tax
injunction
act
to
be
applicable
i
suppose
we
have
to
determine
that
there
was
an
adequate
state
remedy
available.
and
i
wondered
whether
under
california
law
the
trustees,
for
example,
could
have
challenged
the
levy,
since
the
california
statute
seems
to
limit
to
only
the
taxpayers
the
right
to
challenge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
couldn't
have
brought
an
action
had
they
been
concerned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
that
point,
i
suppose
that
the
spouses
and
dependent
children
of
a
beneficiary
under
the
trust
fund
stand
in
a
special
relationship,
because
they
are
among
the
beneficiaries
in
a
sense
themselves,
the
intended
beneficiaries
of
those
funds
ultimately,
unlike
perhaps
the
state
of
california.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
tax
injunction
act,
which
congress
also
passed,
certainly
would
indicate
that
the
district
courts
will
not
enjoin
the
state
tax,
and
grace
brethren
says
that
applies
to
declaratory
judgment
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
watson,
if
i
understood
ms.
kitching
correctly,
she
suggested
that
the
state
remedy
was
for
the
trustees
to
pay
it
over
and
then
sue
for
conversion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
theory?
