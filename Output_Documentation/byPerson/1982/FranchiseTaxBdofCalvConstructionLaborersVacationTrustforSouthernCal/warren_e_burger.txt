we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
the
francise
tax
board
of
california
against
the
construction
laborers
trust.
ms.
kitching,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice

could
you
raise
your
voice
a
little,
ms.

mr.
watson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
the
federal
question
arise
in
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
mr.
watson,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
difference?
what
is
the
significant
difference
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned?
well,
the
significant
difference
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
is
that
it
can
be
argued,
and
i
say
not
necessarily
rightly,
but
it
can
be
argued,
that
the
purpose
of
the
trust
instrument
is
met
when
you
give
the
benefits
to
co-beneficiaries,
a
husband
and
wife,
particularly
in
a
community
property
state
where
they
jointly
own
the
whole
community
property,
with
california
as
a
community
property
state.
when
you
give
the
benefits
to
a
third
party
creditor
not
interested
in
benefits
under
the
trust
fund,
simply
trying
to
latch
onto
those
assets
to
satisfy
some
alleged
debt
incurred
by
one
of
the
beneficiaries,
you
are
defeating
the
purpose
of
the
trust
in
a
way
you
are
not
doing
when
you
give
the
benefits
to
another
person,
a
spouse,
a
husband
or
a
wife,
who
shares
those
benefits
under
california
law
with
the
named
beneficiary
under
the
trust
fund.
well,
i
suppose
if
there
were
a
levy
on
a
life
insurance
policy
that
had
a
large
cash
value
and
a
lot
of
beneficiaries
in
a
community
property
state,
it
wouldn't
be
any
different,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
barrier
to
a
creditor
levying
on
the
cash
value
of
a
life
insurance
policy
in
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
should
there
be
a
difference
because
it's
in
a
controlled
trust?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
purpose
of
the
life
insurance
trust
would
be
defeated,
too.

justice

kitching.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
