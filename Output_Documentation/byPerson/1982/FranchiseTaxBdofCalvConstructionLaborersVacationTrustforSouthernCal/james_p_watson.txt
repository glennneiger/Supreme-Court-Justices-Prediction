mr.
james
p.
watson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
first
address
the
jurisdictional
issue
which
has
been
raised
by
the
state
in
this
case.
the
starting
point
for
the
appellees
is
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
almost
50
years
ago
through
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
the
gully
case.
in
that
case,
justice
cardozo
warned
that
it
would
be
futile
to
attempt
to
determine
the
issue
of
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
future
cases
without
specific
reference
to
the
context
of
the
case.
in
that
case
he
suggested
that
the
court
apply
a
common
sense
accommodation
of
judgment
to
kaleidoscopic
situation
which
characterize
the
law
in
other
areas,
such
as
the
treatment
of
the
problem
of
proximate
cause
in
tort
law.
he
advocated
a
selective
process
which
picks
the
substantial
federal
causes
out
of
the
web
and
lays
the
others
aside.
we
believe
the
court
should
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
this
case
without
doing
violence
to
its
precedents
in
cases
such
as
louisville
&
nashville
railroad
versus
mottley
and
other
cases
of
that
ilk.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
think
the
federal
question
arose
in
the
case,
your
honor,
immediately
when
the
complaint
was
filed.
the
complaint
and
the
exhibits
to
the
complaint
lay
out
the
federal
dispute
in
great
detail.
the
department
of
labor's
opinion
is
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
the
complaint.
it
is
incorporated
by
reference
in
the
complaint.
and
in
paragraph
20
of
the
complaint
the
state
asks
not
merely
for
a
collection
of
the
tax
delinquencies
of
the
laborers;
it
rather
asks
for
a
declaration
of
the
rights
and
obligations
of
all
the
parties,
including
the
trustees
and
the
trust.
that
leads
me
into
the
first
reason
why
federal
question
jurisdiction
must
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
james
p.
watson
that
is
right,
your
honor.
it's
in
the
body
of
the
complaint
and
in
the
exhibits,
not
in
the
prayer.
under
some
ninth
circuit
authorities,
i
might
add,
the
prayer
itself
is
not
considered
part
of
the
text
of
the
complaint,
only
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
incorporated
exhibits.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
would
agree
that
the
board
has
laid
out
the
federal
question
and
stated
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
trust
that
there
is
a
federal
preemption,
that
is
true.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
certainly
the
state
has
a
contention,
however,
also
about
the
effect
of
the
federal
law,
albeit
a
negative
one.
mr.
james
p.
watson
the
declaratory
judgment
action
they
have
filed
is
not
a
federal
remedy
and
their
claim
is
founded
on
a
california
statute,
that
is
clear.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
believe
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
james
p.
watson
well,
i
believe
it
raises
an
issue
under
section
301.
at
least
in
the
ninth
circuit,
it
has
been
held
that
collective
bargaining
agreements...
and
trust
fund
documents
are
considered
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
ninth
circuit
under
the
rehmar
case...
that
third
parties--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--well,
301
gets
here
because
301
provides
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
state
and
federal
courts
of
suits--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--it
did
not
mention
301.
mr.
james
p.
watson
it
could
have.
mr.
james
p.
watson
it
could
have.
mr.
james
p.
watson
on
the
basis
that
the
state
as
a
third
party
under
our
ninth
circuit
law
would
have
the
right,
since
it
asserts
a
claim
arising
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement...
it
says,
the
trust
fund
holds
assets,
the
trustees
are
obligated
to
give
those
assets
to
us--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--in
federal
court,
yes,
we
would.
mr.
james
p.
watson
yes,
i
would,
and
gladly
so.
if
i
may
now
turn
to
the
first
of
my
reasons
why
i
think
there
is
federal
question
jurisdiction
here,
under
section
502(a)(3)
of
erisa
congress
gave
fiduciaries
the
right
to
bring
suit
to
obtain
a
determination
of
rights
and
obligations
under
a
trust
agreement
such
as
this
or
under
erisa
itself,
and
provided
that
federal
courts
would
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
such
suits.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
trustees
in
this
case
that
the
congressional
intent
is
clear
that
federal
courts
decide
these
issues.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
provide
for
exclusive
federal
court
jurisdiction
of
these
cases
unless
congress
intended
that.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
later,
but
let
me
address
that
now,
since
your
honor
brings
it
up.
the
tax
injunction
act,
as
your
honor
has
already
commented,
contains
an
exception
requiring
that
a
plain,
speedy
and
effective
remedy
exist.
otherwise
it
will
be
of
no
effect.
in
this
case,
as
the
court
already
noted
in
colloquy
with
counsel,
the
plain,
speedy
and
effective
remedy
exists,
all
right,
for
the
taxpayer,
but
it
doesn't
exist
for
the
fiduciary.
nor
does
the
taxpayer
have
the
incentive
to
raise
the
legal
issues
the
fiduciaries
would.
we
don't
know
whether
these
taxpayers
owe
these
taxes
or
not.
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
they
probably
do.
if
they
have
a
claim
against
the
state,
it's
only
that
we
don't
owe
the
tax,
we
already
paid
it
in
the
year
in
which
it
was
due.
they
have
no
incentive
to
go
out
and
hire
a
lawyer
and
say,
just
a
minute
here,
these
are
trust
fund
assets
and
you're
breaking
the
trust
agreement.
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
would
even
have
standing
to
raise
such
an
issue
in
a
state
administrative
proceeding
for
refund.
so
it's
clear
that
the
tax
injunction
act
doesn't
provide
the
plain,
speedy
and
effective
remedy
to
the
trustees
in
this
case
that
it
provides
to
the
taxpayer,
and
it's
also
clear
that
the
taxpayer
probably
would
not
raise
the
fiduciary
issue.
a
second
reason,
however,
exists
to
provide
that
the
tax
injunction
act
would
not
apply
here.
in
mitchum
versus
foster,
a
1972
decision
of
this
court
through
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
court
held
that
in
cases
of
conflicts
between
federal
statutes
providing
for
injunctive
remedies
and
the
general
federal
anti-injunction
statute,
that
28
u.s.
code
2283,
the
court
must
look
to
see
whether
application
of
the
general
anti-injunction
statute
would
frustrate
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
subsequent
law
providing
for
injunctive
relief.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
it's
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
that
congress
intended
trustees
to
get
equitable
relief,
declaratory
judgments,
injunctive
relief,
and
did
not
specifically
address
the
issue
of
tax
laws,
although
they
must
have
realized
tax
laws
were
one
possible
area
of
preemption,
and
applying
the
tax
injunction
act
to
prevent
them
from
getting
that
kind
of
relief
in
this
case
would
frustrate
the
clear
congressional
intent
to
permit
them
to
get
instruction
from
the
federal
courts
about
how
to
properly
operate
the
trust
under
erisa.
mr.
james
p.
watson
that's
another
possibility,
your
honor.
but
the
legislative
history
suggests
strongly
to
the
contrary,
and
although
this
gets
into
my
preemption
argument,
it's
clear
from
the
preemption
statute
itself,
which
contains
its
own
exceptions
for
banking
laws,
insurance
laws,
securities
laws,
it
doesn't
mention
tax
laws
and
it
doesn't
mention
state
levies,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
mention
individual
creditors,
even
if
they
are
individual
government
bodies
acting
as
creditors.
that
isn't
in
the
statute,
and,
as
counsel
for
the
state
pointed
out,
the
statute
has
recently
been
amended,
after
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
in
this
case.
if
congress
wanted
to
change
this
statute
and
say,
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
mistake,
we
want
to
make
it
clear
that
state
levy
laws...
not
tax
laws
now,
but
levy
laws,
because
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here...
are
not
preempted,
they
could
have
added
that
in
when
they
amended
514
this
year.
they
did
not
do
so,
and
this
court
in
the
has
dealt
with
the
issue
of
congressional
silence
in
a
way
which
i
think
would
suggest
in
this
case
that,
even
if
congress
didn't
know
in
1974
that
they
were
preempting
state
levy
laws,
they
surely
must
know
now.
and
of
course,
there's
been
litigation
in
other
courts
about
this
matter
also
indicating
that
erisa
preemption
is
very
broad.
so
surely
the
congressional
intent
is
tacitly
in
the
record.
moreover,
there
is
copious
and
i
think
even
redundant
quotes
from
the
sponsors
of
the
original
erisa
bill
set
forth
in
the
briefs
which
show
how
broadly
they
felt
the
preemption
statute
was
to
be
read.
they
did
not
suggest
that
all
common
law
remedies
would
never
apply
to
the
trust
funds,
but
they
did
suggest,
as
in
the
collective
bargaining
cases,
like
lincoln
mills
and
aero
lodge
and
cases
of
that
kind,
that
a
federal
common
law
would
be
developed
by
the
federal
court
to
govern
this
type
of
situation,
and
exactly
that
type
of
thing
ought
to
be
done
in
the
debtor-creditor
type
situation
we
have
here.
we're
not
saying
that
federal
courts
might
not
develop
a
federal
common
law
authorized
by
erisa
that
would
permit
some
kind
of
levy
in
the
future.
but
that
hasn't
been
done
yet
and
it
can't
be
done
under
state
law.
that's
our
main
point.
mr.
james
p.
watson
well,
i
know
of
no
reported
state
case
that
addresses
the
issue
as
your
honor
has
framed
it,
but
the
statute
refers
to
the
taxpayer
as
having
the
remedy.
now,
i
concede
to
the
court
that
probably
when
the
california
statute
was
drafted
nobody
thought
about
trust
funds
like
this,
but
they
surely
must
have
thought
about
third
party
creditors
the
state
might
be
chasing
after
in
order
to
collect
tax
funds,
and
apparently
they
decided
to
leave
it
up
to
the
taxpayer
to
fight
his
own
battle.
mr.
james
p.
watson
oh,
yes,
i
am.
i'm
saying
the
statute
does
not
provide
that.
in
so
many
words,
the
statute
provides
that
remedy
to
the
taxpayer.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i'm
saying...
i'm
saying
to
the
court
that
the
specific
statutory
proceeding
which
is
provided
is
apparently
the
exclusive
remedy,
and
i'm
quite
clear
that
the
board
would
take
the
position
that
the
trust
doesn't
have
the
standing
to
come
into
court
and
say,
wait
a
minute,
mr.
zarate
doesn't
owe
this
tax,
and
that
in
effect
it's
none
of
the
trust
fund's
business
as
long
as
the
trust
fund
holds
assets
payable
to
mr.
zarate,
he
being
one
of
the
taxpayers
in
this
case.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
think
the
statute
is
set
up
in
such
a
way
as
to
require
the
taxpayer
to
fight
his
own
battle,
and--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--if
it
weren't
for
erisa--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--and
it
weren't
for
the
strictures--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--well,
the
state
law
that
also
limits
the
recovery
rights
to
the
taxpayer
also
protects,
also
protects
the
third
party
who
pays
the
money
over
against
suit
or
challenge
by
the
taxpayer.
so
the
trustees
would
have
no
reason
not
to
and
in
fact
would
be
compelled
to
by
the
state.
mr.
james
p.
watson
and
frankly,
if
we
took
just
an
ordinary
third
party,
as
opposed
to
the
trustees,
given
the
protections
the
statute
gives
them
if
they
pay
the
money
to
the
state
and
given
the
judicial
process
the
state
has
to
compel
it,
they
would
have
no
reason
in
the
world
not
to
pay
the
money
over.
i
mean,
the
pressure
comes
from
the
state,
not
from
the
taxpayer,
at
that
point.
they're
facing
suit
by
a
state
agency.
it
can
be
a
fairly
serious
thing.
mr.
james
p.
watson
yes,
and
i
don't
follow
that.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
don't
follow
that.
one
of
the
difficulties
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
has
raised
the
tax
injunction
act
in
its
reply
brief
filed
just
one
week
ago,
so
the
board
does
not
have
the
benefit
of
full
briefs
from
both
parties
on
that.
had
it
been
raised
in
the
original
brief,
i
would
have
addressed
the
matter
in
detail,
and
some
of
the
questions
that
justice
stevens
has
asked
suggest
that
perhaps
the
matter
ought
to
be
looked
into
in
greater
detail.
let
me
pass,
if
i
might,
though,
to
a
second
important
reason
why
federal
question
jurisdiction
ought
to
exist
here.
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
one
of
justice
marshall's
questions,
it's
clear
at
least
under
ninth
circuit
law
that
this
trust
agreement
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
was
signed
by
the
employers
and
the
union.
it
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
section
301
suits,
in
avco
and
boys
market
and
other
suits,
that
the
federal
interest
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
is
pervasive
and,
even
when
such
suits
on
common
law
theories
are
brought
in
state
courts
under
section
301,
they
can
be
removed
by
the
defendant
party
to
federal
court
and
once
in
federal
court
they
must
stay
there.
that's
in
the
aero
case
and
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
this
same
overwhelming
federal
interest
is
present
in
this
case,
not
only
because
this
is
a
form
of
collective
bargaining
agreement,
but
also
because
of
the
very
comprehensive
umbrella
of
erisa
and
the
very
clear
statements
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
section
502
that
congress
wanted
these
questions
resolved
in
federal
courts.
now,
there's
a
third
reason
why
federal
question
jurisdiction
exists
here,
i
believe.
in
1974
in
the
oneida
case
this
court
held
federal
question
jurisdiction
to
exist
in
a
suit
brought
under
a
simple
common
law
ejectment
theory
in
new
york
by
an
indian
tribe,
because
the
court
found
that
inevitably
the
federal
question
would
arise.
it
was
not
a
speculative
issue,
it
was
not
something
lurking
in
the
background
like
gully.
it
was
central
in
the
total
focus
of
the
case.
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
used
the
so-called
pivotal
question
doctrine
to
find
federal
question
jurisdiction.
in
this
case
the
federal
question
isn't
the
pivotal
question;
it's
the
only
question.
there
is
no
other
question
in
the
case.
the
trustees
have
no
other
defense
to
the
payment
of
these
moneys,
we
don't
know
whether
these
taxpayers
owe
the
money,
and
the
state
of
california
gives
the
state
the
right
to
collect
and
leaves
it
to
the
taxpayer
to
fight
it
out
once
they've
gotten
the
money.
mr.
james
p.
watson
if
it
didn't
pay
its
property
tax?
mr.
james
p.
watson
yes.
if
it
didn't
pay
property
tax
on
the
building
it
owns,
i
assume
that
it
would
not
have
a
defense
under
erisa.
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
preempted.
mr.
james
p.
watson
no,
i
don't
think
it
would,
your
honor.
and
there's
a
crucial
difference
between
that
type
of
tax
and
what
we
have
going
on
here,
where
someone
outside,
albeit
a
state
agency,
is
trying
to
take
assets
of
the
fund.
in
this
case,
necessarily--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--well,
they're
trying
to
get
property
taxes.
mr.
james
p.
watson
that's
true.
in
this
case,
though,
they're
trying
to
get
money
set
aside
by
the
trust
to
pay
benefits
to
the
beneficiaries
of
the
trust,
based
entirely
on
a
third
party
dispute.
in
the
case
you
posit,
it's
an
indebtedness
of
the
trust
itself--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--no,
it's
quite
clear
to
me
that
the
trust
as
a
general
debtor
itself
in
the
state
of
california
would
not
have
a
special
position,
although
the
heffernan
case
from
connecticut
does
suggest
that
direct
taxes
on
the
trust
fund
may
be
preempted
by
erisa,
special
taxes
directed
just
at
trust
assets.
but
if
the
trust
owns
real
estate
and
is
subject
to
property
taxes,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
erisa
preemption
provision,
which
says
that
it
preempts
statutes
which
indirectly
regulate
these
trust
funds,
as
this
kind
of
levy
would
by
taking
away
the
benefits
payable
to
the
individuals...
that's
simply
not
the
same
thing.
here
there's
a
very
real
risk
of
depleting
trust
fund
assets
that
were
set
aside
for
another
purpose,
and
that
is
what
we're
concerned
about
here.
i
might
comment
that
the
problem
is
not
made
simpler
by
the
fact
that
this
is
a
state
agency.
an
ohio
district
court,
in
an
opinion
cited
in
the
state's
brief,
has
found
that
general
creditors
can
invade
this
trust.
and
i
might
also
comment
that,
although
we
realize
as
we
stand
before
you
today
that
a
vacation
trust
does
not
seem
by
its
very
essence
to
be
a
very
important
kind
of
trust
fund,
the
court
must
understand
that
congress
treats
the
vacation
trust
in
the
same
way
as
health
and
welfare
trusts
and
apprenticeship
trusts
and
education
trusts
that
provide
medical
and
dental
care
and
visual
care
and
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
james
p.
watson
differently
from
pension
trusts
in
the
sense
that
there's
less
regulation.
but
the
preamble
to
erisa
indicates
that
congress
was
concerned
about
all
these
employee
benefit
plans.
perhaps
this
case
looks
and
sounds
less
weighty
because
we're
not
talking
about
seizing
the
money
payable
for
surgical
benefits
for
a
laborer's
wife
who
has
been
in
the
hospital
and
he
doesn't
have
any
other
money.
since
it's
a
vacation
trust,
it
looks
like
a
check
that's
payable
to
him
for
a
relatively
inconsequential
purpose.
but
by
letting
the
state
invade
this
fund
now
for
this
reason,
the
court
will
open
the
door
to
having
the
health
and
welfare
benefits
taken,
the
educational
benefits
taken,
and
any
other
benefits
that
creditors
want
to
latch
onto.
and
if
the
ohio
court's
theory
were
followed...
and
they
followed
the
dissent
of
the
ninth
circuit...
this
would
not
be
limited
to
state
agencies.
this
would
be
limited
to
any
general
creditor.
so
we
have
i
think
a
rather
significant
federal
problem
in
the
case.
there
is
a
fourth
reason
why
we
think
that
this
is
clearly
a
federal
question
case.
in
two
recent
cases
in
this
court,
jones
versus
rath
packing,
and
the
alessi
case,
alessi
versus
raybestos-manhattan,
this
court
has
accepted
and
heard
cases
on
the
merits
raising
preemption
issues,
the
jones
case
from
the
ninth
circuit,
the
allessi
cases,
two
of
them,
from
the
third
circuit.
both
of
those
cases
were
cases
where
in
the
courts
below
extended
consideration
was
given
to
whether
jurisdiction
existed
under
the
so-called
"arising
under"
language,
and
in
both
cases
the
employers
were
able
to
convince
the
courts
that
that
was
so.
this
court
left
those
findings
undisturbed,
and
since
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
never
waived
i
can
only
conclude
that
this
court
was
satisfied
that
there
was
an
adequate
jurisdictional
ground.
mr.
james
p.
watson
that
is
true,
your
honor,
that
is
true.
however,
the
removal
statute
provides
that
cases
which
could
have
been
brought
in
the
district
court
which
are
arising
under
federal
law
may
be
removed.
and
since
the
preemption
issue
we
believe
furnishes
the
adequate
basis
for,
as
this
complaint
came
to
the
court
and
as
it
was
pleaded,
the
"arising
under"
jurisdiction,
we
don't
think
there's
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
think
your
honor
is
right.
the
court
has
to
take
the
case
as
it
finds
it,
although
i
might
comment
that
the
wong
case,
which
is
discussed
in
some
detail
in
our
brief,
does
indicate
that
courts
have
the
power
to
realign
the
parties,
and
because
of
the
pervasive
federal
interest
and
the
fact
that
all
of
the
features
of
the
dispute
were
known,
it
would
not
be
beyond
the
power
of
the
district
court
in
determining
whether
jurisdiction
existed
to
bring
the
case
originally
to
say,
well,
effectively
the
trustees
can
be
treated
as
plaintiffs
here.
that's
what
happened
in
bacon
versus
wong,
where
the
original
complaint
did
not
adequately
state--
mr.
james
p.
watson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
now
to
move
to
the
preemption
phase
of
the
case
in
the
remaining
ten
minutes
of
my
argument.
as
mr.
justice
powell
has
noted
in
many
opinions
for
this
court,
the
primary
source
for
interpreting
the
statute
is
the
statute
itself.
in
this
case,
we
believe
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
both
the
preemption
provision
and
section
403,
which
limits
the
right
of
the
trustees
as
fiduciaries
to
spend
money
for
the
purposes
set
forth
in
the
trust
agreement
and
for
the
reasonable
costs
of
defraying
trust
expenses,
are
very,
very
clear.
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
the
breadth
of
the
preemption
provision,
we
think
the
legislative
history
wipes
away
that
doubt.
and
i
will
not
take
the
court's
time
this
afternoon
to
quote
that
history.
it
is
extensive
and
in
the
briefs.
the
state
suggests
that,
as
in
the
marital
dissolution
cases,
there
ought
to
be
some
kind
of
implicit
exception
for
state
tax
levies.
they
say
that
state
courts
and
some
federal
courts
have
found
such
an
exception
in
cases
where
pension
benefits
and
other
benefits
had
to
be
divided
between
former
spouses
to
a
dissolved
marriage,
and
they
say,
why
not
us
as
well.
and
we
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that:
one,
it
is
not
clear
from
the
opinions
of
this
court
that
the
marital
dissolution
cases
are
correct.
although
this
court
summarily
dismissed
the
campa
case
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question,
there
is
no
authoritative
opinion
of
this
court
approving
the
reasoning
of
the
lower
court
decisions
in
the
marital
dissolution
cases.
second,
as
was
brought
out
in
the
colloquy
between
counsel
for
the
state
and
one
of
the
members
of
this
court,
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
dividing
benefits
among
co-beneficiaries
of
one
of
these
trust
funds
and
giving
those
intended
benefits
to
a
creditor.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
the
state
is
nothing
more--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--well--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--you're
talking
now
not
about
a
life
insurance
policy
under
one
of
these
controlled
trusts,
but
just
a
general
life
insurance
policy.
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
i
think
that
there
could
be
a
levy
on
such
a
policy.
mr.
james
p.
watson
because
in
this
situation
the
trust
is
controlled
by
erisa
and
erisa
explicitly
in
section
403
limits
the
way
in
which
the
assets
can
be
disbursed,
and
apparently
does
that,
if
i
may
expand
on
that,
because
congress
was
concerned
in
passing
erisa
that
trust
fund
benefits
were
being
dissipated
in
ways
which
cause
the
purpose
of
the
trust
to
be
defeated.
we
all
know
that
the
main
reason--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--well,
it
would.
but
since
it's
a
private
arrangement
and
one
in
which
congress
has
not
injected
itself,
the
federal
interest
is
not
there.
there
could
be
federal
legislation
on
that
at
some
time
in
the
future,
but
absent
that
there
would
be
no
argument
in
a
federal
court
on
it
like
there
is
today.
i
mean,
erisa
is
the
reason
we
are
here,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--oh,
yes,
i
definitely
would.
if
the
court
is
asking,
do
the
new
amendments
to
the
statute
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case
in
any
way,
i
would
say
the
only
way
in
which
they
do
so
is
to
make
it
clear
that
congress
was
satisfied
with
the
result
the
ninth
circuit
reached
in
this
case.
it
is
not
unusual,
as
the
court
knows
from
the
kaiser-mullins
case,
for
congress
to
comment
on
decisions
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
lower
federal
courts,
and
the
legislative
history
in
kaiser-mullins,
many
lower
court
decisions
are
cited.
this
legislation,
which
was
passed
and
signed
just
in
january
of
this
year,
six
months
after
this
decision
was
issued,
two
years
after
the
heffernan
delinquent,
contains
no
indication
that
congress
was
dissatisfied.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i
do,
your
honor.
i
do
think
that.
i
think
that
in
attacking
the
agsalud
problem
and
leaving
this
problem
alone,
congress
was
telling
this
court
and
other
courts
that
it
is
satisfied
with
the
preemption
results
being
reached
by
lower
courts.
mr.
james
p.
watson
that's
exactly
right,
yes.
i
am
not
representing
to
the
court
that
the
legislative
history
specifically
says,
we
think
the
result
the
ninth
circuit
reached
in
this
case
is
a
good
one.
but
by--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--it
didn't
change
it,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
james
p.
watson
that's
exactly
right.
prior
to
the
break
justice
marshall
had
asked
why
it
would
be
that
the
trust
would
have
to
pay
property
taxes
but
would
not
have
to
pay
this
kind
of
levy.
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
in
section
403
of
the
act,
which
provides
that
the
trustees
may
pay
out
trust
assets
for
the
purposes
described
in
the
trust
document
and
also
for
defraying
the
expenses
of
operating
the
trust.
having
a
building,
hiring
employees,
paying
the
taxes
incurred
in
operating
the
trust,
those
are
clearly
permissible
purposes.
mr.
james
p.
watson
it
said
"may".
it
didn't
say
"had
to".
mr.
james
p.
watson
that's
correct.
those
are
clearly
permissible
purposes,
however,
that
don't
raise
the
preemption
problem
here.
finally,
if
i
may
turn
to
one
other
question
that
was
raised
before
the
break,
justice
stevens
had
asked,
well,
couldn't
the
trustees
get
some
kind
of
remedy
in
state
court
using
some
kind
of
common
law
theory.
even
if
the
statute
provides
only
the
taxpayer
has
the
remedy,
surely
the
trustees
can
go
in
and
challenge
this
whole
setup.
the
quick
answer
to
that,
and
it
gets
us
back
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
is
that
section
502
requires
that
the
trustees,
when
they
seek
instruction
from
the
court
about
their
fiduciary
responsibilities
or
their
responsibilities
under
erisa,
it
requires
that
those
suits
be
brought
in
federal
court.
so
if
the
trustees
in
this
case
had
brought
their
own
suit
against
the
state
in
state
court,
the
state
would
have
had
a
total
defense:
the
state
court
simply
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
again,
it
gets
us
back
to
why
this
must
be
a
federal
court
case.
finally,
and
i
will
conclude
on
this
point,
the
state
has
suggested,
in
referring
to
the
marital
dissolution
cases,
that
there's
that
implicit
exception
in
the
act;
perhaps,
as
some
lower
courts
have
stated
and
suggested,
other
high
public
purposes
deserve
an
equal
exemption.
my
response
to
that
is
simply,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
that
every
high
public
purpose
would
create
an
implicit
exemption
to
the
very
clear
preemption
statute.
a
second
response
to
that
is:
how
many
high
public
purposes
are
there
and
who
is
to
decide
what
they
are?
if
the
court
goes
along
with
the
idea
that
levying
on
trust
assets
to
satisfy
tax
delinquencies
of
the
beneficiaries
is
a
high
public
purpose,
we
will
see
many
more
cases
before
this
court
and
lower
courts
where
people
are
asserting
that
their
purposes
are
equally
worthy.
that
is
surely
not
what
the
framers
of
the
act
intended.
it
is
very
foreign
to
the
purpose
of
the
erisa
statute.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
james
p.
watson
the
requirement
is
in
section
502(a)(3)
and
502(e)
of
the
act.
mr.
james
p.
watson
of
erisa.
it
provides
that
the
trustees
may
bring
an
action
seeking
equitable
or
other
relief,
including
injunctive
relief...
which
gets
us
to
the
tax
injunction
act
problem,
as
it
may
conflict
in
this
language
with
that...
to
determine
their
rights
and
obligations
under
the
trust
instrument
or
under
erisa
itself.
now,
in
the
case
your
honor
posited
the
only
defense
the
trustees
have,
the
only
one
we're
asserting
here,
is
that
erisa
prevents
us
from
paying
out
this
money
to
third
party
creditors.
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
suit,
exactly
the
kind
of
question,
that
section
502(e)
says
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of.
and
if
a
state
court
proceeding
were
allowed
to
get
at
that
kind
of
critical
issue
under
erisa
despite
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
language
in
the
statute,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute,
to
keep
these
very
sensitive
questions
in
federal
court,
would
be
completely
frustrated.
mr.
james
p.
watson
i'm
saying
that,
regardless
of
the
remedy
that
the
trustee
sought--
mr.
james
p.
watson
--yes.
i
am
saying
that,
whether
the
trustees
call
the
lawsuit
a
cow
or
a
pony,
whether
they
say
it's
a
state
court
declaratory
relief
action
or
under
some
state
common
law
theory
like
conversion,
it's
clear
that
what
they're
really
looking
for
is
instruction
about
how
to
operate
under
their
fiduciary
obligations
under
erisa,
and
the
statute
says
that's
preempted.
it's
got
to
be
in
federal
court.
mr.
james
p.
watson
that's
exactly
right.
the
state
lacks
the
jurisdiction
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
james
p.
watson
your
honor,
i
apologize
to
the
court
if
there
was
a
defect
in
the
brief.
