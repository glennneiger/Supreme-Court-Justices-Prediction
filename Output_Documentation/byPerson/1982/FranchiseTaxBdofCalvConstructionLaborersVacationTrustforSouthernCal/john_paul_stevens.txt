mr.
watson,
it
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
the
entire
prayer
of
the
complaint,
the
four
paragraphs
after
the
"wherefore",
say
nothing
at
all
about
anything
federal?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
not
also
agree
that
the
reference
to
the
federal
claim
is
in
the
nature
of
what
the
defendants
will
assert
by
way
of
defense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
prayer
for
relief
and
what
they
ask
for
is
not
a
claim
arising
under
federal
law,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
before
you
get
too
far
away
from
the
jurisdictional
question,
on
the
question
of
an
adequate
state
california
remedy,
are
you
telling
me
that,
supposing
the
state
had
levied,
had
a
case
of
mistaken
identity,
for
example,
that
a
person
that
they
said
owed
them
taxes
was
not
really
a
beneficiary
of
the
trust
or
something
like
that...
wouldn't
the
trustees
have
a
remedy
in
resisting
the
levy
in
some
state
proceeding
that
would
be
prompt
and
efficient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
you're
not
questioning
the
fact
that
the
trustee
would
have
a
prompt
and
adequate
state
remedy
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
had
any
obligation
to
comply
with
the
levy,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
think
there
is
any
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
california
law
at
all
that
would
enable
the
trustee
to
question
a
levy
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
the
duty
of
the
trustee
always
would
be
just
to
pay
over
the
money?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
the
trustees
would
just
automatically
pay
over
the
money
in
all
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
assuming
no
erisa
problem,
just
the
state
law,
you
know,
sort
of
garden
variety
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
watson,
let
me
be
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
my
other
question.
where
is
the
requirement
that
the
trustees
must
proceed
in
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
erisa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
saying...
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
what
you're
saying
is
the
reason
there's
no
state
remedy
is
that
erisa
has
preempted
the
state
remedy?
that's
what
you're
argument
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
absence
of
the
adequate
state
remedy,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
is
because
there's
a
provision
in
erisa
which
preempts
what
might
otherwise
be
a
state
remedy?
