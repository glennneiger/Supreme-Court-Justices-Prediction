i
think
you
will
find
there
is
a

although
that
rate
can
vary
from
time
to
time
as
mr.
bator
indicated.

mr.
berlin,
i
guess
you
agree,
do
you
not,
that
the
standard
of
review
that
should
be
applied
in
the
court
is
an
abuse-of-discretion
standard
of
review
in
determining
whether
the
commission
properly
exercised
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
berlin,
it
does
appear
that
adoption
of
the
full
avoided
cost
rule
is
simply
the
upper
limit
of
what
is
permitted
under
the
statute,
so
the
commission
appears
to
have
acted
within
the
framework
of
the
statute
but
simply
set
the
rate
at
the
upper
limits.
isn't
it
in
fact
a
question
of
whether
acting
in
that
way
is
an
abuse
of
discretion?
