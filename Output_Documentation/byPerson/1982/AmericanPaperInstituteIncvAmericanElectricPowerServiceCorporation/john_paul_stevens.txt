but
is
it
not
true,
mr.
bator,
that
at
all
times,
even
though
the
full
avoided
cost
may
be
different
at
different
times
of
the
day
and
so
forth,
at
all
times,
it
is
the
maximum
rate
permitted
by
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
at
any
given
time
of
day,
whatever
that
rate
might
be
if
it
is
equal
to
the
utility's
full
avoided
cost,
it
is
the
highest
the
statute
would
permit
to
be
charged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point,
one
of
the
objections
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
was
that
the
commission
had
not
adequately
explained
its
reasoning.
i
understand
your
argument.
you
think
it
was
made
in
the
same
terms
by
the
commission
that
you
made
it
today.
in
fact,
they
said
in
one
place
that
it
would
not
produce
any
savings
for
consumers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
commission
didn't
assume
there
would
be
savings,
did
it?
mr.
bator's
argument
was
not
disagreeing
with
that
the
commission
said--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
explanation
of
its
own--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
found
public
benefit
because
of
the
reduction
in
the
use
of
coal
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
obviously
true,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
a
public-interest
factor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
sir,
what
part
of
the
statute
did
they
not
comply
with?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
hypothesis
this
is
just
and
reasonable
because
if
they
didn't
buy
the
substitute
power,
they
would
still
have
a
rate
that
the
local
utility
said
was
just
and
reasonable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
congress
could
have
said,
"it
must
be
there",
but
i
think
you
said
they
have
violated
the
statute
by
prescribing
the
statutory
maximum.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
one
of
the
alternatives
the
statute
permits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
broad
question?
under
your
view
of
the
statute,
would
the
commission
have
the
power
to
adopt
a
rule
that
would
give
the
authority
to
a
local
state
commission
to
make
the
decision
on
whether
a
particular
interconnection
should
be
made?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
seemed
to
say
that
section
210
of
the
power
act
is
the
exclusive
authority...
statutory
authority...
for
interconnection
orders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
true,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
require
that
the
federal
power
commission
in
washington
issue
all
those
orders.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
source
of
the
rule-making
authority
you
say
is
there?
is
it
210(a)
of
purpa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
i
understand
your
argument,
but
i
am
not
entirely
sure
the
commission
made
that
argument.
