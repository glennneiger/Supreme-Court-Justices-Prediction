mr.
edward
berlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i,
too,
will
be
dealing
with
the
purchase
rate
rule.
i
suggest
that
if
congress
wished
to
encourage
every
last
drop
of
cogeneration,
it
would
have
legislated
the
100-percent
avoided
cost
rule.
it
did
not
do
that
because
it
wished
the
commission
to
inquire
to
search
out
whether
it
was
possible
consistent
with
the
statutory
objectives
to
share
some
element
of
the
savings
with
the
utility
consumers.
it
did
not
intend
for
the
commission
to
do
what
it
did
which
was
to
automatically
without
that
inquiry
legislate
the
100-percent
rate
which
congress
itself
certainly
could
have.
the
commission
failed
to
inquire.
it
rejected
out
of
hand
the
percentage
of
avoided
cost
possibility
on
the
speculation
that
it
might
not
bring
forth
every
last
drop
of
cogeneration.
it
did
not
even
consider
the
possibility
of
establishing
such
a
percentage
as
a
beginning
rate
allowing
co-generators
to
come
in
and
seek
more
if
that
is
insufficient
in
encouragement
for
them.
mr.
edward
berlin
justice
rehnquist,
it
undoubtedly
is
the
case
that
a
great
deal
of
cogeneration
that
will
be
produced
by
the
rule
will
be
produced
in
response
to
the
legislation
and
of
the
rule
fairly
immediately.
in
fact,
there
is
a
great
flurry
of
activity
as
mr.
bator
has
indicated.
under
the
commission's
rules,
co-generators
have
an
absolute
right
to
a
long-term
contract.
they
do
not
have
to
rely
on
negotiations
apart
from
the
rule
to
get
a
long-term
contract.
under
the
commission's
rules
they
can
get
a
long-term
assurance
of
a
100-percent
rate.
i
suggest
that
if
the
congress
shared
the
view
that
is
assumed
in
your
question,
if
it
wished
to
encourage
every
last
drop,
it
would
have
legislated
a
100-percent
rule.
mr.
edward
berlin
under
304(d)
of
the
commission's
rules,
a
co-generator
at
its
option
can
in
fact
force
a
long-term
commitment
at
100
percent
of
avoided
cost.
mr.
edward
berlin
we
use
the
term,
"to
the
discretion
and
option
of
the
co-generator.
"
if
the
co-generator
is
willing
to
commit
capacity
or
energy
for
any
term,
then
under
that
rule,
the
utility
must
accept
it
and
must
pay
the
full
100
percent
of
avoided
cost
rate.
mr.
edward
berlin
that
is
certainly
correct,
and
i
think
that
shows
the
illogic
in
simply
looking
at
the
utilities'
rate
in
establishing
a
rate
that
will
be
sufficient
to
encourage
cogeneration.
indeed,
even
under
a
100-percent
rate,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
for
any
particular
co-generator
that
will
be
enough.
congress
realized
that.
that's
why
congress
put
in
the
specific
rate
criteria
in
210(b).
it
wanted
the
commission
to
exercise
its
judgment
to
make
some
inquiry,
not
an
intrusive
inquiry,
but
some
inquiry
nonetheless
to
make
certain
that
it
was
providing
enough,
but
not
entirely
excluding
consumers
if
it
was
possible
to
permit
consumers
to
share.
mr.
edward
berlin
quite
frankly,
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
whether
it
is
arbitrary
or
capricious,
a
substantial
evidence
need
not
be
reached
in
this
case
because
it
is
our
contention
that
the
agency
simply
failed
to
carry
out
the
statutory
criteria,
failed
to
apply
the
statutory
criteria.
mr.
edward
berlin
i
think
that
is
probably
correct,
and
we
would
not
dispute.
now,
i
do
note,
although
i
don't
think
it
is
an
issue
in
this
case,
that
the
federal
power
act
itself
makes
substantial
evidence
the
review
standard.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
agency
has
complied
with
the
mandate
imposed
upon
by
the
statute,
and
that
is
what
we
are
arguing.
we
are
contending
that
they
abused
this
discretion.
they
acted
arbitrarily
in
failing
to
give
meaning
to
the
statutory
criteria.
mr.
bator
says
that...
and
i
was
about
to
cite
the
court
to
the
reference
in
the
commission's
opinion
where
they
say,
"there
will
be
no
rate
savings
for
consumers.
"
mr.
bator
construes
the
commission's...
and
the
commission
chose
not
to,
but
he
construes
it
saying,
"the
commission
really
means
there
will
be
no
immediate
savings
for
consumers,
but
there
will
be.
"
i
assume
he
is
implying,
"long-term
savings".
that
is
categorically
wrong.
there
cannot
be
any
rate
savings
for
consumers
in
the
immediate
future
or
over
the
long
term.
the
whole
logic
of
the
100-percent
avoided
cost
rule
is
that
if
a
utility
as
a
consequence
of
the
availability
of
co-generated
power
is
able
to
reduce
its
own
cost
of
generation,
it
must
pay
the
full
measure
of
that
savings
immediately,
tomorrow,
and
in
the
future
to
the
co-generator.
the
utility's
costs
do
not
go
down
one
cent.
its
consumer
rates
cannot
go
down
one
cent.
mr.
edward
berlin
i'm
not
sure
that
is
the
upper
limit
permitted
by
the
statute,
justice
o'connor.
the
statute
provides
and
the
government
concedes
this
in
its
reply
and
it
certainly
made
very
clear
in
the
conference
report
that
the
upper
limit
is
either
the
rate
produced
by
application
of
the
210(b)
criteria
or
the
utility's
avoided
cost
whichever
is
the
lower.
we
suggest
to
you
that
congress
recognized
that
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
might
well
be
lower
than
the
utility's
avoided
cost,
and
that's
why
it
mandated
the
commission
to
inquire.
now,
the
government
endeavors
to
substantiate
the
commission's
rule
by
reasons
similar--
mr.
edward
berlin
--yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
berlin
there
is
nothing
to
preclude
the
commission
from
changing
its
rule
in
the
future,
and
should
it
change
its
rule
and
should
it
lower
the
rate
below
100
percent,
then
there
would
be
a
possibility.
i
was
just
simply
pointing
out
that
i
think
mr.
bator
is
in
error
in
suggesting
that
under
a
100-percent
rule
there
can
be
savings.
there
cannot
be
now
or
in
the
future.
mr.
bator--
mr.
edward
berlin
--absolutely
not.
mr.
edward
berlin
absolutely
not.
the
commission--
mr.
edward
berlin
--not
even
that,
justice
stevens.
the
commission
said
first
very
clearly,
"there
will
not
be
consumer
savings.
"
mr.
edward
berlin
then
it
went
on
and
said,
"commenters
have
pointed
out,
nonetheless,
that
there
may
be
fuel
savings.
"
et
cetera.
mr.
edward
berlin
that
obviously
is
true--
mr.
edward
berlin
--and
we
don't
dispute
it.
mr.
edward
berlin
and
there
is
question
that
it
can
take
that
into
consideration.
mr.
bator
suggests
that
the
alternative
confronting
the
commission
was
either
to
establish
a
100-percent
generic
rule
or
subject
co-generators
to
intrusive
cost-of-service
regulations.
we
obviously
agree
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
subject
co-generators
to
utility-type
regulation,
but
look
at
the
conference
report
that
he
cites
in
his
brief,
footnote
2,
page
2
of
the
reply
brief.
"congress
clearly
did
not
preclude
any
inquiry
into
co-generator
cost.
"
"it
said,.
"
in
fact,
it
cannot
be
contended
that
the
commission
would
be
under
a
great
burden
if
it
undertook
that
responsibility.
there
is
a
companion
rulemaking
which
you
will
find
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
that
companion
rulemaking
defined
qualifying
status...
those
utilities
that
would
qualify
for
purpose
benefits.
in
undertaking
that
rulemaking,
the
commission
said,
"we
must
do
a
market
penetration
analysis.
"
"we
must
anticipate
how
much
cogeneration
would
be
brought
forth
by
a
100-percent
avoided
cost
rule.
"
as
it
says
on
page
b-139,
"we
begin
our
inquiry
by
looking
at
co-generator
costs.
"
the
commission
in
fact
had
a
great
deal
of
information
available
to
it
about
co-generator
costs.
mr.
bator
also
suggests,
"so
i
say
that
when
they
are
burdensome,
there
are
ways
available
without
subjecting
them
to
adjudicatory
case-by-case
inquiry.
"
"permian
basin
is
certainly
a
prime
example
of
what
could
have
been
done.
"
mr.
bator
also
suggests
in
his
brief
that
we
should
give
deference
to
the
commission.
it
is
a
start-up
rule.
it
was
making
predictive
judgements.
again,
he
is
putting
words
in
the
commission's
mouth.
the
commission
never
said
that
this
is
a
start-up
rule,
that
we
are
doing
the
best
that
we
could
in
light
of
limited
facts.
in
fact,
the
companion
rulemaking
shows
that
they
had
a
great
deal
more
information
available
to
them.
the
predictive
judgment
cases
have
never
stood
for
the
proposition
that
you
excuse
compliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
that
you
validate
a
rule
but
fail
to
comply
with
the
statutory
prescription.
i
would
now
like
to
turn--
mr.
edward
berlin
--they
made
no
effort
at
all,
justice
stevens,
to
look
at
any
of
the
210(b)
criteria.
210(b)
says
that
we
should
consider
a
rate
that
is
dressed
in
reasonable--
mr.
edward
berlin
--that,
sir,
is
exactly
what
congress
knew
and
told
us.
if
it
wished
to
capture
none
of
the
savings
for
utility
consumers,
it
would
have
prescribed
and
wished
to
maximize
cogeneration,
would
have
prescribed
a
100-percent
rule.
mr.
edward
berlin
well,
let
me
then
correct
that,
justice
stevens.
mr.
edward
berlin
a
100
percent
avoid
cost
rule
is
certainly
permitted
by
the
statute,
and
if
i
have
given
any
contrary
indication,
let
me
retract
it.
i
suggest,
however,
that
before
the
commission
can
arrive
at
that
100-percent
statutorily
permitted
rate,
it
must
give
deference
to
the
criteria
articulated
by
the
statute.
the
commission
never
did
that.
it
simply
joined
to
the
ceiling
that
congress
had
established
and
said,
"that
is
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
"
let
me
turn
to
interconnection
issue
if
i
can.
the
commission
has
directed
that
in
every
case
in
which
a
co-generator
wishes
to
ship
power
into
a
utility
system,
interconnection
ought
to
take
place
automatically
without
the
need
to
comply
with
the
federal
authority.
we
say
that
may
not
do,
justice
stevens,
under
the
statute.
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face.
here
we
are
dealing
with
two
different
section
210's.
i
hope
i
don't
confuse
it.
we
are
dealing
with
section
210
of
the
federal
power
act
which
is
an
interconnection
provision.
in
purpa
section
210
which
has
the
rate
provision
in
it,
congress
authorized
the
commission
to
exempt
co-generators
from
certain
provisions
of
the
power
act,
but
it
said,
"you
may
not
exempt
them
from
the
interconnection
provision
of
the
federal
power
act.
"
for
mr.
bator
to
prevail
before
you,
he
has
two
hurdles
to
overcome.
he
has
to
show
the
validity
of
his
rule
in
light
of
210(e)(3)(b),
the
non-exemption
provision,
and
if
he
does,
he
must
establish
nonetheless
that
there
is
implicit
authority
in
purpa
to
order
interconnection.
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
government's
argument
really
is
illogical.
the
government
contends
correctly
that
congress
knew
all
along
that
there
must
be
interconnection
authority,
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
"congress
confers
this
authority
implicitly",
though
indeed
the
congress
did
know
that
there
had
to
be
interconnection
authority.
it
provided
that
interconnection
authority
in
the
federal
power
act.
that
was
the
pattern
followed
from
the
very
inception
of
the
legislation.
there
was
always
a
cogeneration
rate
provision
and
a
companion
interconnection
provision
which
from
the
very
first
day
included
co-generators,
small
power
producers.
those
little
guys
that
mr.
bator
was
talking
about
were
always
included
in
the
federal
power
act
interconnection
provision.
when
the
administration
testified
on
the
legislation,
the
deputy
administrator
of
fea,
the
federal
energy
administration,
said,
"the
interconnection
provision
of
the
federal
power
act
would
be
the
vehicles
by
which
co-generators
were
getting
to
connections.
"
he
didn't
suggest
that
there
was
implicit
authority
in
the
companion
cogeneration
provision.
mr.
bator
in
his
reply
brief
says,
"we
can
forget
about
their
testimony.
"
"that
was
addressed
to
the
administration's
bill,
not
to
the
bill
as
enacted
by
the
house,
but
there
was
no
substantial
difference
in
the
respect
that
i
am
now
talking
about
between
those
two
bills.
"
more
to
the
point,
the
testimony
that
the
government
chooses
not
to
deal
with
except
in
a
footnote
reference,
that
of
the
chairman
of
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
charles
curtis,
was
addressed
to
the
house-passed
bill,
the
bill
that
mr.
bator
says
is
relevant
from
a
legislative-history
purpose.
that
bill
bears
some
consideration.
at
that
time,
the
house-passed
bill
contained
two
different
interconnection
provisions:
the
federal
power
act
interconnection
provision
with
transmission
facilities
and
the
cogeneration
interconnection
provision
allowing
interconnection
with
distribution
facilities.
what
does
chairman
curtis,
the
chairman
of
the
agency
that
is
to
administer
the
statute,
say?
he
said
to
congress,
"you
must
pass
the
federal
power
act
interconnection
provision
because
that
will
be
the
vehicle
by
which
all
co-generators
and
small
power
producers,
the
little
guys,
get
the
ability
to
shift
power
into
a
utility
system.
"
mr.
edward
berlin
the
commission
could
certainly
under
my
view--
mr.
edward
berlin
--and
i
totally
advocate
its
responsibility.
i
think
it
may,
justice
stevens,
have
the
capacity
to
delegate
responsibility
to
state
commissions
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
cases.
i
think
it
must,
however,
leave
its
door
open
a
crack
to
allow
someone
who
believes
that
a
federal
interest
is
being
violated,
and
the
federal
interest
here
is
an
interest
in
the
reliability
of
the
interconnector
transmission
network
to
come
before
it
and
raise
that
reliability
question.
mr.
edward
berlin
with
transmission
facilities,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
berlin
that
is
correct,
and
let
me
respond
to
what
i
think
lurks
behind
your
question.
the
government
certainly
implies
that
if
we
prevail,
we
will
be
setting...
we
will
be
requiring
all
of
these
thousands
of
small
windmills
that
mr.
bator
very
vividly
talks
about.
he
doesn't
talk
about
the
amicae
in
this
case,
the
large
paper
companies
and
chemical
companies
and
petroleum
companies
who
will
account
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cogeneration,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
let's
speak
about
his
windmills.
the
statute
certainly
says
that
interconnection
proceedings
ought
to
be
treated
as
adjudicatory
proceedings.
it
references
the
apa
sections.
to
my
mind,
justice
stevens,
that
shows
that
congress
was
very
concerned
about
these
types
of
proceedings.
it
does
now
follow,
however,
that
simply
because
these
are
adjudicatory
proceedings
that
you
must
have
thousands
of
proceedings
before
the
ferc.
i
am
reminded
of
this
court's
decision
in
weinberger
v.
heinsen,
also
an
adjudicatory
situation,
where
i
believe
justice
rehnquist
was
writing
for
the
court,
and
he
said
that
even
in
that
situation
when
you
use
your
rule-making
authority
to
establish
general
rules,
to
establish
congressional
requirements,
if
mr.
bator
is
correct
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
interconnections
will
not
present
issues
worthy
of
adjudicatory
proceedings,
then
we
submit
that
the
commission
can
take
care
of
that
by
using
its
rule-making
authority
by
directing
a
threshold
variable.
what
it
may
not
do
is
to
prevent
a
utility
which
believes
it
has
the
capacity
to
overcome
that
threshold
showing
from
any
opportunity
to
come
before
it.
i
think
my
answer
to
your
question--
mr.
edward
berlin
--no,
i
think
it's
a
general
authority
to
issue
rules
and
regulations
under
the
federal
power
act.
i
suggest
that
if
you
look
at
chairman
curtis's
testimony,
if
you
recognize
that
he
was
addressing
legislation
which
at
that
time
said
that
co-generators
can
obtain
interconnections...
rather
that
distribution
interconnections
were
available
under
the
cogeneration
provisions.
when
you
recognize
that
he
said
that
was
not
going
to
be
the
vehicle
because
we
are
dealing
with
transmission
facilities,
please
enact
the
federal
power
act
interconnection
provision.
that
shows
that
the
government
is
flatly
wrong
in
making
the
voltage-level
distinction
it
tries
to
make
between
transmission
and
distribution
facilities.
in
fact,
it
is
not
a
voltage-level
distinction
at
all.
it
is
a
functional
distinction.
this
court
has
held
facilities
as
low
as
12
kilovolts
in
the
city
of
colton
case
to
be
transmission
facilities.
conversely,
it
has
held
slightly
larger
facilities,
13.8
kilovolts
to
be
distribution
facilities
in
the
connecticut
light
and
power
case.
why
is
that?
the
reason
for
that
is
that
is
not
a
voltage
level
distinction.
it's
a
functional
distinction.
when
power
is
being
shipped
to
an
ultimate
consumer
and
it
is
going
in
one
direction
when
a
utility
controls
the
flow
of
it,
can
protect
its
system,
can
protect
its
other
customers,
that
is
a
distribution
facility,
but
when
someone
who
is
not
under
the
control
of
the
utility
unilaterally
controls
the
flow
of
power
into
a
utility
system,
when
it
is
a
two-way
flow,
and
that
is
what
the
commission's
rules
require...
it
requires
parallel
operation...
then
you
are
dealing
with
transmission
facilities.
congress
recognized
that.
it
recognized
the
transmission
facilities
present
unique
problems,
and
it
dealt
with
those
unique
problems
comprehensively
in
the
210
provisions.
remember,
in
the
210
federal
power
act
provision,
congress
included
from
the
very
inception
co-generators,
small
power
producers,
those
little
guys
who
were
going
to
produce
less
than
80
megawatts.
congress
included
them
because
it
recognized
the
potential
for
reliability
problems,
and
it
recognized
that
was
a
non-delegable
federal
interest
that
ferc
could
not
abdicate
its
responsibility.
now,
let
me
say
a
word
about
210(e)(3)(b).
congress
has
just
finished
writing
210
of
the
federal
power
act
through
all
of
the
things
that
i
have
just
described.
why
did
it
put
in
210(e)(3)(b)?
it
put
in
210(e)(3)(b)
in
conference
at
the
same
time
it
put
in
a
savings
clause
in
the
federal
power
act,
210(12)(e)
and
at
the
same
time
it
put
in
the
necessary-to-encourage
language.
why
do
they
do
that?
what's
the
logical
explanation?
what's
the
fair
reading?
well,
the
fair
reading
was
that
congress
simply
did
not
want
the
commission
to
undo
what
it
carefully
crafted
in
the
federal
power
act
interconnection
provision,
and
that's
why
it
put
in
210(e)(3)(b).
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
repeats
one
argument
that
the
commission
had
offered
and
then
offers
two
new
arguments
that
hadn't
been
made
before.
first
it
contends
that
there
is
really
a
target
applicant
distinction,
that
210(e)(3)(b)
is
intended
to
exempt
co-generators
when
they
are
targets,
but
you
cannot
exempt
them
from
being
targets
for
interconnection
orders,
and
it
points
out
that
when
you
exempt
somebody,
you
exempt
them
from
an
obligation,
from
a
duty,
from
a
burden.
mr.
edward
berlin
a
target
is
the
government's
invention
for
the
justification
of
210(e)(3)(b)
which
says
that
you
cannot
exempt
qf's
or
co-generators
from
the
federal
power
act
interconnection
provision.
the
commission
says
that
what
congress
was
really
saying
there
was
you
cannot
exempt
a
co-generator
when
it
is
the
target
of
someone
else's
efforts
to
interconnect
with
it.
under
210
of
the
federal
power
act,
a
co-generator
can
either
apply
for
an
interconnection
or
it
can
be
the
unwilling
recipient
of
someone
else's
interconnection.
mr.
edward
berlin
yes,
and
that's
when
they
are
a
target.
the
problem
is
that
210
contains
burdens
when
you
are
an
applicant.
indeed,
the
whole
purpose
of
putting
212
in
the
federal
power
act
is
to
impose
burdens
on
those
who
are
applicants
for
interconnection
orders.
secondly,
the
government
implies
that
co-generators
were
included
as
targets
for
the
first
time
in
conference
when
(e)(3)(b)
was
added.
we
suggest
to
you
that
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case.
if
you
look
at
the
house
and
senate
bills
that
preceded
conference
which
the
government
timely
included
as
an
appendix
in
the
reply
brief,
you
will
see
that
they
both
reference
the
possibility
that
cogenerators
could
be
targets
of
interconnection
orders.
finally,
in
a
footnote
to
its
reply
brief,
the
government
contends
that
(e)(3)(b)
talks
about
facilities.
when
discussing
cogenerators
as
targets,
they
talk
about
them
as
facilities,
and
that,
it
implies,
buttresses
its
target-applicant
distinction.
i
point
out,
however,
that
210(e)(1)
which
is
the
provision
which
gives
the
commission
the
authority
to
exempt
cogenerators
from
the
federal
power
act,
from
the
public
utility
holding
company
act,
from
state
laws
also
talks
about
facilities.
carried
to
its
logical
extreme,
it
would
mean
that
the
barrier...
the
barrier
that
congress
was
determined
to
pull
down,
the
barrier
of
regulations,
would
remain
because
under
(e)(1)
the
commission
could
not
relieve
owners,
operators.
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
is
not
addressed
to
facilities.
it's
addressed
to
the
owners
of
those
facilities.
all
of
the
reporting
requirements,
all
of
the
accounting
requirements
would
remain
if
the
government's
highly
technical
reading,
admittedly
in
the
footnote
to
its
brief,
was
sustained.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
