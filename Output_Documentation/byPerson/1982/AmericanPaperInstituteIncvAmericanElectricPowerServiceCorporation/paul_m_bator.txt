mr.
paul
m.
bator
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
two
rules
issued
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
ferc.
under
section
210
of
the
statute
commonly
known
as
purpa,
the
public
utility
regulatory
policies
act
of
1978.
the
government
is
here
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
these
rules
invalid.
it
is
the
submission
of
the
government
that
the
court
of
appeals
misread
the
statute,
that
the
rules
are
valid,
and
that
the
ruling
of
that
court
threatens
to
cripple
an
important
and
an
exciting
experiment
that
congress
set
on
when
it
enacted
purpa.
i
want
to
start
by
giving
some
background
to
put
the
arguments
made
in
our
brief
and
our
reply
brief
in
context.
this
court
is
of
course
familiar
with
purpa
from
its
decision
last
term
in
ferc
and
mississippi.
in
purpa
congress
embarked
on
an
ambitious
attempt
to
encourage
the
development
of
innovative
energy
efficient
technology
for
producing
electric
power.
the
central
point
was
to
lessen
the
country's
dependance
on
foreign
oil,
to
end
the
waste
of
nonrenewable
fossil
fuel,
and
to
encourage
energy
efficiency.
more
specifically,
congress
sought
to
tap
the
tremendous
reservoir
of
potential
energy
potentially
available
from
renewable
sources
and
from
wasted
heat
produced
in
industrial
and
domestic
settings.
there
are
two
technologies
involved.
cogeneration
is
the
simultaneous
production
of
electricity
on
the
one
hand
and
thermal
energy,
heat
and
steam,
on
the
other.
small
power
production
is
the
generation
of
relatively
small
amounts,
less
than
80
megawatts
of
electricity,
from
non-fossil
fuel
and
renewable
sources,
wind,
water,
sun,
organic
materials,
and
waste.
cogenerators
and
small
power
producers
together
are
referred
to
as
qualifying
facilities,
qf's
for
purposes
of
this
case.
in
enacting
purpa,
congress
found
that
cogeneration
of
small
power
production
was
hindered
historically
in
this
country
by
two
things:
the
traditional
electrical
utilities,
the
interests
represented
by
the
respondent
here,
sought
to
preserve
their
monopoly
in
the
production
of
electricity
by
refusing
to
buy
electricity
from
or
selling
back
of
electricity
to
qf's.
secondly,
an
uneconomical
and
rigid
regulatory
environment
deterred
firms
from
entering
the
business
of
unconventional
power
production.
behind
these
two
labels,
cogeneration
and
small
power
production,
there
is
a
world
of
hundreds
of
variagated
technologies.
cogenerators
and
small
power
producers
come
in
all
sizes
and
shapes
from
the
$5,000
back-yard
windmill
producing
maybe
10
kilowatts
to
the
enormous
paper
mill
generating
maybe
300
to
400
kilowatts
of
power
that
may
cost
several
hundred
million
dollars
to
build.
qf's
use
dozens
of
different
fuels
from
walnut
shells
to
garbage,
from
sawdust
to
geothermal
brine.
every
facility
that
needs
a
fair
amount
of
heat
is
a
potential
co-generator,
every
hospital,
school,
every
laundry,
every
apartment
house.
this
is
a
wide-open
road.
it
is
open
to
all
comers.
it
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
traditional
monopolistic
electric
utility
business.
now,
there
are
three
critical
elements
in
the
congressional
plan
for
encouraging
cogeneration
and
small
power
production.
first,
section
210
of
purpa
creates
a
legal
obligation
on
utilities
to
buy
to
and
sell
from
qf's.
second,
congress
instructed
ferc
to
relieve
qf's
from
the
constricting
regulatory
environment
that
surrounded
the
commerce
in
electrical
energy.
the
third
element
in
the
congressional
plan
was
decentralization.
the
states
are
to
play
a
critical
role.
ferc
was
given
one
year
to
issue
general
framework
rules
to
state
the
enterprise,
to
set
it
on
foot.
implementation
was
then
to
go
forward
at
the
state
level.
i
turn
now
to
the
first
rule
in
question
in
this
case.
here
the
commission
addressed
the
question
of
what
rate
is
to
be
paid
by
a
utility
buying
power
from
a
qf.
after
extensive
rule-making
proceedings,
ferc
determined
that
a
two-track
system
should
be
established.
rates
for
old
capacities,
co-generators
and
small
power
producers
already
in
existence
or
under
construction,
those
rates
were
left
on
a
flexible
basis
to
state
commissions.
the
second
track
was
for
new
capacities
not
yet
in
existence.
it
was,
of
course,
here
that
the
central
purpa
purpose
of
encouraging
new
firms
to
come
in
was
in
play.
the
rate
system
for
new
capacity
was
itself
sub-divided
into
two
tracks:
one,
rates
could
be
set
by
negotiation
in
contracts
at
any
level
agreed
to
by
the
parties
thus
allowing
the
marked
full
play.
two,
if
there
is
no
contract,
then
a
purpa
rate
system
comes
into
play.
the
purpa
rate
system
is
that
the
utility
buying
power
from
the
qf
must
pay
the
qf
the
full
avoided
cost
of
that
power.
now,
this
is
in
turn
subject
both
to
state
implementation
and
state
waivers.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
your
honor,
if
there
had
been
a
physical
way
to
state
them
together
simultaneously,
i
would
have
because
they
proceed
in
tandem.
actually,
in
the
regulations
the
very
first
thing
in
the
regulations,
the
very
first
of
the
two,
refers
to
the
full
play
of
negotiated
and
bargained-for
rates,
and
it
is
later
in
section
304
that
we
get
the
full
avoided
rate...
full
avoided
cost.
i
think
it
is
important
that
there
not
be
a
misunderstanding
about
what
the
purpa
system
and
full
avoided
cost
is
because
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
really
had
a
misunderstanding
of
it.
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
that
this
was
a
very
rigid,
flat,
single
uniform
rate.
full
avoided
cost
is
not
really
a
rate
at
all.
it
is
a
rate
system.
it
is
a
dynamic
rate
structure.
it
means
simply
that
the
amount
paid
by
the
utility
to
the
qf
equals
the
cost
the
utility
would
have
incurred
had
that
particular
quantum
of
power
not
been
available
from
the
qf
if
it
had
to
be
produced
by
the
utility.
full
avoided
cost
is
simply
the
cost
the
utility
avoided
by
having
the
qf
power
made
available.
this
means
that
full
avoided
cost
is
anything
but
rigid.
it
varies
from
utility
to
utility.
it
varies
within
each
utility
everytime
fuel
costs
go
up
and
down.
when
opec
puts
down
the
price
of
oil,
full
avoided
cost
goes
down
because
the
power
that
would
have
had
to
have
been
produced
by
the
utility
would
have
been
less.
further,
it
is
important
to
note
that
even
when
fuel
prices
are
flat,
full
avoided
cost
varies
because
the
unit
cost
of
producing
electricity
is
not
uniform.
the
more
power
a
utility
has
to
produce,
the
higher
the
unit
cost
to
produce
it.
it
is
a
firm
rule
of
utility
practice
that
the
most
efficient,
least-costly
facilities
are
turned
on
first
and
are
turned
off
last.
thus,
a
utility
may
have
coal,
oil,
gas-fired
units.
at
a
time
of
low
demand,
the
low-cost
coal-fired
units
come
on
line.
if
demand
goes
up,
the
next
block
of
power
comes
in,
the
higher-priced
fuel-oil-fired
units.
at
times
of
peak
demand,
the
so-called
peakers
come
on.
those
may
be
the
very
high-price
natural-gas-fired
units.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
the
full
avoided
rate
system
is
the
maximum
rate
permitted
by
the
statute.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
it
is
the
highest
that
the
statute
permits.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
but
the
actual
price
involved
varies
not
only
over
these
long
ranges
but
will
vary
even
within
a
given
day.
at
3:00
a.m.
when
demand
is
very
low,
only
the
very
low-cost
facilities
are
on,
and
the
price
avoided
by
the
utility
is
the
low
price.
at
7:00
p.m.
when
demand
high,
if
there
is
qf
power
available,
it
would
be
replaced
relatively
high
priced
oil.
a
qf
that
is
supplying
power
over
16
or
24
hours
a
day...
they
all
do...
does
not
get
just
the
peak
price.
it
gets
the
average
price.
what
this
means
is
that
full
avoided
cost,
since
it
depends
on
the
cost
of
the
power
it
is
replacing,
it
means
that
the
first
qf
that
comes
along
will
always
get
the
highest
full
avoided
cost.
it
is
replacing
the
most
expensive
fuel.
the
next
one
that
comes
along
will
be
replacing
the
next
block,
less-costly
capacity.
the
third
one
that
comes
along
will
be
getting
a
lower
price.
really,
the
beauty
of
the
system
is
that
qf
capacity
replaces
the
least
efficient
utility
capacity
first,
and
the
other
beauty
of
the
system
is
that
the
more
qf
power
comes
in,
the
lower
the
full
avoided
cost.
it
drives
down
the
full
avoided
cost
because
it
will
be
replacing
less
and
less
costly
utility
capacity.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
invalidated
this
rule.
why?
it
did
so
because
it
found
that
the
commission
did
not
adequately
take
into
account
the
interest
of
electrical
utility
consumers.
the
court
of
appeals
evidently
concluded
that
full
avoided
cost
system
would
lead
to
excessive
profits
to
qf's
because
cost
savings
would
not
be
passed
on
immediately
to
utilities
and
their
customers,
and
it
concluded
that
this
violated
the
statutory
command
that
the
rate
be
just
and
reasonable
to
consumers.
our
submission,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
treading
in
an
infinitely
complicated
and
technical
area
entrusted
to
an
expert
commission
really
misapprehended
the
statute,
misapprehended
the
commission's
regulatory
task
under
the
statute,
and
certainly
misunderstood
the
workings
of
the
purpa
rate.
the
court
of
appeals
asserted
that
the
statute
requires
basically
that
qf
profits
be
limited
so
that
all
savings
or
a
lot
of
savings
could
immediately
pass
through
to
customers.
of
course,
this
is
traditional
utility
regulation.
this
is
cost-of-service
regulation
in
which
the
return
to
the
seller
is
limited
in
terms
of
the
seller's
cost,
but
in
this
statute
congress
made
its
intention
clear.
as
the
conference
report
which
is
quoted
at
length
in
our
reply
brief
makes
clear,
congress
did
not
wish
these
entities
to
be
subjected
to
the
cumbersome
case-by-case
cost-of-service
regulation
traditional
in
the
utility
business.
in
other
words,
the
commission
rightly
rejected
cost-of-service
rate
making
here
as
a
solution
because
congress
had
identified
it
as
the
problem.
rate-making
pitched
to
qf
cost
is
really
in
opposite
in
this
industry
for
three
reasons:
the
costs
are
an
infinitely
variagated
set
of
costs
associated
with
an
incredibly
complex
and
various
form
of
technology
and
enterprise.
we
are
talking
about
future
costs.
this
is
new
capacity
in
a
rapidly
developing
and
a
technologically
very
volatile
field.
most
important,
we
are
talking
about
an
industry
that
is
an
at-risk
open-to-all-comers
industry.
it
is
fully
competitive.
so
that
the
problem
of
monopoly
profits
does
not
exist
in
this
case,
and
it
is
in
light
of
this
clearly-expressed
congressional
purpose
that
ferc
determined
that
rather
than
rates
pitched
to
the
seller's
cost,
an
across-the-board
rate
set
by
rule
in
advance
was
necessary.
now,
to
return
to
justice
stevens:
why
start
it
at
100
percent
of
avoided
cost?
why
not
some
lower
figure?
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
might
show
a
savings
in
some
way
with
utility
customers.
our
answer
is
that
the
cost
had
to
be
set
in
advance
in
a
world
of
uncertainty
under
a
statute
whose
principal
purpose
was
to
entice
entrants,
new
firms,
into
the
business.
now,
from
this
advanced
perspective,
this
whole
picture
of
savings
and
excess
profits
is
very
misleading.
you
don't
know
in
advance
what
the
costs
of
that
new
qf
are
going
to
be.
here
is
an
illustration.
suppose
there
is
a
utility
which
has
an
avoided
cost
at
peak
times
and
a
peak
demand
of
eight
cents
a
kilowatt
hour.
it's
true
that
maybe
a
qf
will
come
along
that
has
only
a
four-cent
cost,
and
yet
under
the
purpa
rate,
the
utility
will
have
to
pay
eight
cents.
you
say,
"why
not
set
it
at
six
cents?
"
"the
qf
would
still
be
making
a
profit
and
some
of
the
savings
could
be
passed
along.
"
the
difficulty
is
that
in
advance
you
don't
know
whether
the
qf
that
is
going
to
come
along
has
a
four-cent
cost
or
whether
it
has
a
six-cent
or
a
seven-cent
or
an
eight-cent
or
a
ten-cent
cost.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
absolutely
no,
your
honor.
absolutely
no.
it
is
absolutely
a
comparative
invitation.
you
can
come
in
as
long
as
you
are
more
efficient
than
the
utility.
if
in
my
illustration,
the
qf's
cost
is
nine
cents,
it
won't
come
in
because
it
can't
get
more
than
eight.
now,
suppose
the
commission
had
done
that
which
it
is
constantly
being
invited
to
which
is
set
a
rate
at
less
than
full
avoided
cost.
suppose
the
commission
had
set
a
six-cent
maximum,
75
percent
of
full
avoided
cost.
what
would
be
effective
then?
it
would
have
deterred
from
the
market
qf's
that
could
produce
electricity
at
six
cents
and
seven
cents.
that
capacity
would
never
have
been
built,
and
if
it
is
never
built,
what
do
we
have
in
its
place.
we
have
eight-cent
utility
power.
the
eight-cent
utility
power
is
using
low
efficiency
fossil
fuel
and
not
the
renewable
resource
that
congress
wishes
to
encourage
in
that
case.
finally,
the
court
of
appeals
picture
of
savings
here
is
misleading
because
it
simply
forgets
the
self-correcting
nature
of
full
avoided
cost.
it
may
happen
that
the
first
one
that
comes
in
has
four-cent
cost
and
therefore
gets
a
fairly
high
profit,
but
that
will
attract
other
firms
into
the
business.
the
next
firm
won't
get
that
profit
because
it
has
to
replace
lower-cost
utility
capacity.
it
drives
down.
under
the
purpa
plan
state
commissions
are
constantly
readjusting
full
avoided
cost.
eventually,
full
avoided
cost
should
come
down
to
a
market
clearing
or
equilibrium
rate.
it
is
a
self-correcting
rate.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
your
honor,
that
depends
entirely
on
the
state
implementation.
in
a
sense
what
this
does
is
leave
it
open
to
the
states
to
work
out
the
details,
and
there
is
now
going
on
in
every
state
elaborate
rule
making.
in
a
lot
of
states,
it
is
averaged
out.
there
are
all
kinds
of
systems
being
tried
out.
the
full
avoided
cost
generally
is
reevaluated
from
time
to
time
and
in
some
states
very,
very
frequently.
of
course,
that
really
leads
me
to
my
next
point.
there
is
a
way
in
which
you
can
get
a
guaranteed
grandfather
rate,
and
that
is
to
contract.
that's
the
alternate
track.
that
is
quite
apart
from
the
purpa
rate.
the
qf
and
the
utility
can
bargain
any
rate
they
wish.
in
this
industry
that
is
essential
for
the
qf
because
the
qf
cannot
get
financing
without
a
long-term
contract.
the
purpa
rate
is
too
risky.
it
is
subject
all...
it
may
be
reevaluated
by
the
commission.
it
is
subject
to
the
state
implementations.
it
is
subject
to
every
variation
in
the
price
of
fuel.
there
is
a
lot
of
bargaining
going
on.
qf's
have
the
incentive
to
bargain
because
they
need
long-term
stability
for
financing.
utilities
have
an
incentive
to
bargain.
why?
because
of
the
purpa
rate.
before
the
purpa
rate,
the
utilities
had
no
need
to
bargain.
the
commission
explicitly
found
that
it
is
the
existence
of
the
purpa
maxim
that
would
tilt
the
utilities
into
bargaining,
and
what
is
happening
in
the
industry?
the
southern
california
experience
which
has
been
referred
to
in
the
brief
shows
clearly
that
contracts
are
being
written,
and
they
are
producing
savings
to
utility
customers
because
they
are
below
fully
avoided
cost.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
we
think
that
that
sentence,
which
we
would
have
been
happier
had
they
not
included
it
in
their
opinion,
in
context
refers
to
short-term.
it
is
clear
that
this
system
doesn't
guarantee
short-term
savings,
but
we
think
that
the
commission
report...
and
the
commission
was
operating
under
the
informal
rule-making
statute
of
the
apa.
all
its
obligation
was
to
give
a
concise
general
statement.
it
did
not
have
to
make
findings.
the
standard
of
review
here
is
not
substantial
evidence.
we
think
that
the
commission's
report
and
its
background...
it
was
a
very
sensitive
staff
report
here
that
the
commission
played
off
on.
there
were
rules,
amendments
to
the
rules.
we
think
that
the
entire
record
sensitively
read
clearly
shows
that
the
commission
had
all
these
matters
in
mind.
i
will
add
just
one
more
quick
point
on
this
one,
and
that
is
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
is
all
to
be
considered
experimental.
the
statute
explicitly
told
purpa,
"do
this
fast
in
one
year.
"
"send
this
baby
out
and
let's
see
what
happens.
"
"let
the
states
do
the
implementation.
"
"states
can
come
in
and
get
waivers
if
they
don't
like
it.
"
the
commission
was
told
explicitly
in
the
statute,
"reevaluate
your
role".
the
commission
really
decided
that
this
purpa
system
would
eventually
replicate
market
forces.
it
would
maximize
the
statutory
purpose
for
creating
an
incentive
for
new
firms
to
come
in
all
of
which,
justice
stevens,
without
a
penny
of
extra
costs
for
the
utility
costs.
there
is
no
harm
either
to
the
utility
or
to
the
customer.
that
is
built
into
the
system.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
if
there
are,
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
know.
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
i
am
embarrassed
to
say
that
i
just
don't
know.
we
do
feel,
your
honor,
that
the
commission's
expert
judgment
that
this
was
the...
and
it
was
a
predictive
judgement...
that
this
was
a
good
way
to
start
this
experiment
should
not
have
been
overturned.
this
experiment
is
really
already
succeeding.
that
is,
under
the
purpa
rate
there
are
droves
of
co-generators
and
small
power
producers
coming
in
seeking
to
qualify
under
this
statute
since
1980
under
the
purpa
rules.
about
seven
and
a
half
million
kilowatts
of
capacity
have
been
applied
for
to
qualify
as
qf's
under
purpa.
now,
that
is
the
equivalent
of
seven
or
eight
nuclear
plants,
so
this
baby
is
out
there,
and
it
is
flourishing,
and
the
states
are
adopting
very
many
varieties
of
ways
to
implement
the
fully
avoided
cost
system.
if
the
thing
sours
or
goes
bad
somewhere,
a
state
utility
commission
which
is
the
natural
representative
of
a
consumer
interest.
the
utilities
are
here
rather
piously
telling
us
that
they
are
interested
in
consumers,
but
it
is
historically
the
state
utility
commissions
that
have
protected
the
consumer,
and
if
they
think
this
thing
is
ripping
off
the
consumer,
they
are
quite
free
to
come
in
and
get
a
waiver
or
suggest
a
change.
your
honor,
i
have
only
three
minutes
to
deal
with
my
dazzingly
complicated
second
issue
which
is
the
interconnection
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
here
held
that
the
rule
requiring
utilities
to
hook
up,
to
make
the
physical
interconnection
necessary
to
accomplish
purchase
and
sales
under
purpa
is
invalid.
section
210
of
purpa
requires
utilities
to
hook
in
order
to
purchase
and
sell
power,
and
the
commission
sensibly
ruled
that
the
only
way
to
purchase
and
sell
power
was
to
make
the
physical
interconnection
so
that
you
can
do
it.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
only
way
you
can
do
this
is
to
use
the
enormously
complicated
separate
proceeding
provided
in
section
210
of
the
federal
power
act
to
accomplish
this.
the
arguments
on
this
issue
where
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
misconstrued
the
two
statutes
and
really
issued
a
ruling
threatening
to
cripple
this
experiment
again.
i
will
leave
to
our
brief
and
reply
brief
and
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
yes,
chief
justice,
just
a
few
comments.
the
question
raised
by
mr.
berlin
about
the
legal
obligation
under
the
rules
of
the
utilities
to
enter
into
the
long-term
arrangements,
i
would
like
to
complicate
it
in
a
tricky
reading
of
these
rules.
we
believe
and
the
government
submits
that
it
requires
an
enormous
torture
process
to
be
done
to
the
language
to
those
rules
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
utilities
have
a
long-term
obligation
or
have
an
obligation
to
enter
into
long-term
contracts
with
qf's.
the
simple
reading
and
the
straightforward
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
in
the
absence
of
using
the
purpa
system
you
simply...
each
side
is
wholly
free
to
bargain
or
not
to
bargain
to
a
long-term
contract.
on
the
long-term-saving
question,
justice
stevens,
on
mr.
berlin's
account
of
this
statute,
it
would
be
totally
inexplicable.
why
fix
the
utilities
so
they
will
be
unable
since
the
purpa
rate
went
into
effect
to
obtain
long-term
contracts
at
less
than
fully
avoided
cost?
the
reason
that
long-term
saving
will
inure
to
the
customer
is
the
commission's
rules
explicitly
provide
that
the
availability
of
qf
power
as
it
comes
into
play
should
be
taken
in
account,
should
be
factored
into
the
calculation
of
fully
avoided
cost.
mr.
paul
m.
bator
well,
they
put
it
in
the
rule.
rule
292.304(e)(6)
says
to
the
states,
"factor
it
in".
the
commission
did
explicitly
say
the
other
thing
which
is
that
the
existence
of
the
purpa
rate
would
pit
both
parties
into
negotiation,
and
that
is
what
it
has
done.
and
that
has
already...
we
don't
even
have
to
wait
for
the
long
term.
customers
have
already
realized
savings.
finally,
on
this
one,
the
commission
explicitly
made
a
relevant
modest
disavowal.
they
said,
"this
rulemaking
presents
an
effort
to
evolve
concept
in
a
newly-developing
area.
"
that
is
not
our
invention.
that's
what
the
commission
said.
now,
on
the
interconnection
question,
mr.
berlin
makes
light
of
the
obligations
that
would
be
imposed
if
every
interconnection
had
to
start
with
a
section
210
power
act
proceeding.
my
only
response
to
that,
your
honor,
is
to
sit
down
and
read
section
210
of
the
power
act.
it
requires
an
absolutely
full
evidentiary
hearing,
a
complete
set
of
public-interest
findings.
substantial
evidence
must
support
all
of
these
findings.
there
is
an
absolutely
overwhelming
process.
the
two
statues,
the
power
act
and
purpa,
are
the
product
of
an
enormously
complicated
and
untidy
legislative
process,
and
all
i
have
time
for
is
to
beg
the
court
to
understand
that
there
were
two
very
different
things
going
on
at
the
same
time.
the
power
act
was
dealing
with
a
different
range
of
problems,
and
it
is
really
just
sort
of
an
unhappy
coincidence
that
there
is
a
kind
of
surface
plausibility
to
injecting
this
totally
inapposite
power
act
proceeding
into
the
middle
of
every
purpa
interconnection.
it
makes
no
sense.
it
makes
absolutely
no
sense.
for
these
reasons
and
the
reasons
stated
in
our
brief,
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed.
