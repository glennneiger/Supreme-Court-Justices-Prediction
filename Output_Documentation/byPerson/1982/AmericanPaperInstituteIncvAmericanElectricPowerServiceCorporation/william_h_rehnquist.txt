well,
the
full
avoided
cost
rule
really
doesn't
guarantee
any
qf
a
profit,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
first
qf
in
a
field
of
a
particular
utility
get
kind
of
a
grandfather
right
to
replace
the
highest
cost
power?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
berlin,
why
is
it
irrational
for
the
commission
to
say
that
when
we
want
to
get
this
thing
off
the
ground
we
do
want
to
bring
in
every
last
drop
of
cogeneration
because
then
we
will
know
that
the
co-generators
are
doing
as
well
as
they
can,
and
then
there
will
be
time
enough
to
adjust
and
see
what
proportion
of
those
benefits
are
passed
on
to
the
consumers
later
after
the
co-generators
are
in
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
they
can
get
a
long-term
contract
without
negotiation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
term
as
the
rules
say.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
just
dressing
up
the
same
argument
another
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
just
ask
one
question--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--about
what
you
are
just
talking
about,
mr.
berlin.
you
say
that
there
are
no
prospects
in
store
of
savings
for
consumers
even
down
the
road.
does
the
commission's
action
of
promulgating
this
particular
rule
negate
the
possibility
that
perhaps
three
or
four
years
from
now
after
it
is
satisfied
that
there
are
viable
co-generators
in
the
field
of
changing
the
full
avoided
cost
rule
so
as
to
pass
on
the
savings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
have
heard
about
qf's
and
purpa.
what
is
a
target?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sort
of
like
a
take
over.
