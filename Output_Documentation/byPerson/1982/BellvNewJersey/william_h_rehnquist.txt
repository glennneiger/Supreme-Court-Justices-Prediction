at
least
with
respect
to
pennsylvania
the
sum
was
substantially
cut
down?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
any
part
of
your
position
that
the
state
would
have
a
defense
to
repayment
of
the
money
if,
in
fact,
they
were
found
to
have
violated
the
statute
but
neither
knew
or
should
have
known
that
they
did?
do
you
think
there
is
some
sort
of
an
intent
element?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
secretary's
discretion
in
that
regard
is
reviewable
by
the
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
geller,
in
analyzing
new
jersey's
setoff
position
a
little
further,
what
if
the
secretary
followed
your
advice
and
said
we
are
going
to
give
new
jersey
$990,000
this
year
on
the
condition
that
new
jersey
puts
up
$10,000
of
its
own
and
new
jersey
says,
no,
we
won't
put
up
$10,000
of
our
own.
then
what
does
the
secretary
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
recover
on
what
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
is
something
that
simply
can
be
filed
in
a
district
court
or
registered
and
sued
on
like
a
judgment
on
other
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
direct
recoupment
and
offset
as
it
has
been
used
by
the
various
parties
to
these
conversations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
offset
and
recoupment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
take
the
position
you
are
now
taking
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cole?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
strikes
me
that
your
analogy
to
the
pennhurst
situation
is
by
no
means
a
complete
one.
as
i
recall
in
pennhurst,
congress
had
granted
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
then
the
argument
was
that
because
of
some
things
in
the
legislation
the
states
were
expected
to
put
in
a
great
deal
more
money
if
they
accepted
the
grant.
but,
here,
all
the
money
we
are
talking
about
comes
from
the
federal
government.
it
is
just
a
question
of
whether
the
states
are
expected
to
spend
it
in
accordance
with
the
terms
on
which
they
received
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
identical.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
focus
is
on
what
would
the
state
expect
in
getting
into
this
thing,
don't
you
think
it
is
far
more
likely
that
most
people,
if
they
accept
a
million
dollars
on
certain
conditions,
that
they
do
a
particular
thing
with
that
million
dollars,
would
expect
to
be
held
to
it,
then
if
they
accept
a
million
dollars
and
one
of
the
conditions
that
they
put
in
another
$5
million
of
their
own,
but
the
condition
is
somewhat
vague?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
you
say
allocation
of
risk
as
if
this
were
kind
of
a
joint
venture
and
each...
you
participated
in
the
employment
of
someone
who
made
off
with
some
funds.
but,
here,
if
the
government
granting
to
new
jersey,
new
jersey
misspends
the
funds,
it
seems
to
me
the
risk
would
be
100
%
on
new
jersey
in
a
normal
situation.
it
was
new
jersey
employees
who
did
it.
