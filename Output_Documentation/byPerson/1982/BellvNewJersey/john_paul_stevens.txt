justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
could
you
help
me
on
one
thing?
how
do
you
view
the
order
that
was
entered
by
the
secretary
here?
was
it
an
order
to
pay
or
an
order
defining
the
amount
that
was
due
to
be
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
end
us
saying
this
is
how
much
should
be
paid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
really
isn't
any
order
outstanding
requiring
anybody
to
pay
anybody
else
any
money,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
you
said
it
did
not
require
them
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sets
the
amount,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
happens
if
they
just
say,
well,
that
is
very
nice,
we
owe
you
that
money,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
neither
of
those
actions
is
before
us
now,
is
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
geller,
i
still
am
not
clear
in
my
mind
why
the
secretary
couldn't
do
exactly
what
you
suggested
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
namely,
say
you
want
to
stay
in
the
program
we
are
sure
and
you
are
just
going
to
have
to
pay
$1
million
to
get
$990,000.
that
still
is
a
pretty
favorable
offer
to
the
state.
why
do
you
have
to
litigate
it
when
you
have
got
the
chips
in
your
hands?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
doesn't
that
answer
the
whole
lawsuit?
i
really
don't
understand.
if
you
assert
you
have
a
right
to
do
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and,
judge
higginbotham
in
dissent,
as
i
understood
him,
said,
well,
that
issue
really
isn't
presented
because
you
haven't
tried
it
yet.
he
said
your
future
remedies
are
not
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
they
misread
the
secretary's
orders.
the
secretary's
orders
say
this
amount
should
be
paid
and
they
read
them
as
orders
saying
they
must
be
paid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
why
isn't
all
that
dicta
as
judge
higginbotham
said?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
clearly
weren't.
they
weren't
using
the
common
law
recoupment
power
before--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
didn't
enter
an
order
requiring
any
payment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
geller,
the
order
that
the
secretary
entered
was
that
new
jersey
should
make
the
following
payments
and
lists
dollar
amounts.
surely
they
could
review
the
accuracy
of
the
dollar
amounts,
but
there
wasn't
anything
in
the
administrative
proceeding
as
to
how
the
amount
should
be
paid,
by
what
mechanism
payment
should
be
enforced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
amounts
were
owed,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
decide
how
much
was
owed.
the
district
court
of
appeals
didn't
disagree
with
their
power
to
decide
how
much
was
owed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
hunting,
what
in
your
view
should
the
federal
government
do
if
the
procedures
had
been
fair...
i
know
you
disagree...
and
if
you
really
had
misspent
money
and
clearly
misspent
the
money?
would
there
be
any
remedy
for
the
federal
government
with
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and,
what
should
it
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
is
a
proper
remedy
to
say
you
spend
a
million
dollars
and
we
will
give
you
$950,000
or
whatever,
you
know,
just
give
you
the
amount
less
that
they
claim
you
have
misspent?
is
that
a
proper
way
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
still
am
not
clear
then.
how
could
they...
in
your
view,
is
there
any
way...
assuming
a
case
where
procedures
were
fair
and
the
facts
were
against
you,
a
different
case.
is
there
any
way
the
government
could
get
its
misspent
money
back
from
the
state
of
pennsylvania?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
facts
are
really
irrelevant
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
you
win
no
matter
what
the
facts
are
under
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
hunting,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
understanding
of
exactly
what
is
before
us?
i
notice
in
the
petition
for
review
filed
by
the
state
of
new
jersey,
they
object
to
the
order.
they
ask
for
a
review
of
the
secretary's
order
ordering
new
jersey
to
refund
certain
money,
whereas
your
petition
asks
them
for
a
review
of
an
order
ruling
that
pennsylvania
should
refund
a
certain
amount
of
money.
do
you
think
you
were
ordered
to
pay
the
money
or
there
was
merely
a
determination
of
how
much
money
was
owed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
does
assess
interest,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cole,
are
the
letters
enclosing
the
orders
and
which
the
letters
said
we
expect
you
to
pay
interest,
are
they
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
orders
themselves
don't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
pay
so
much,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more
question,
mr.
cole?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
if,
as
a
condition
of
future
grants
by
the
federal
government,
they
said
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
any
more
money
unless
you
first
repay
the
amount
that
was
determined
to
be
misspent
under
this
audit,
would
they
have
that
power?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
couldn't
even
say
we
will
eliminate
you
from
future
programs
unless
you
repay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
could
they
subtract
from
the
reimbursement
under
such
a
program
the
amount
that
they
found
due
under
this
audit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
is
yes,
they
could
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
there
is
no
question
there
was
an
order,
but
it
is
a
very
strangely
worded
order,
mr.
geller?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
final
in
the
sense
of
determining
the
amount
due.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
nothing
in
there
directing
payment
by
anyone
to
anyone
at
any
particular
point
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
are
they
part
of
the
order
in
your
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
the
follow-up
letters
part
of
the
order
in
your
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
have
to
look
at
those
to
know
what
the
order
means?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
remove
any
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
order?
