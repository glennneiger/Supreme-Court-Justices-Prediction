mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1965,
congress
passed
title
i
of
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act
for
the
purpose
of
expanding
and
improving
programs
designed
to
meet
the
special
educational
needs
of
educational
deprived
children
in
low
income
areas.
congress
chose
to
accomplish
this
purpose
by
use
of
grants
of
federal
funds
to
state
educational
agencies
or
sea's
which
in
turn
would
distribute
the
money
to
needy
local
educational
agencies
or
lea's,
generally
school
districts.
the
respondents
in
this
case,
pennsylvania
and
new
jersey,
have
each
received
over
$1
billion
in
title
i
federal
funds
since
the
start
of
this
program.
now,
in
return
for
obtaining
these
massive
amounts
of
federal
funds,
states
must
agree
to
abide
by
certain
conditions
written
into
the
title
i
statute
and
regulations.
these
conditions
are
designed
to
insure
that
only
eligible
children
receive
title
i
services
and
that
title
i
funds
are
not
used
to
provide
general
aid
to
schools
or
to
replace
state
and
local
funds
that
would
otherwise
have
been
spent
for
participating
children.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
authority
of
the
secretary
of
education
to
recoup
federal
funds
paid
to
the
states
under
the
title
i
program
in
instances
where
the
funds
were
used
in
violation
of
the
assurances
provided
by
the
states
when
they
received
the
federal
money
and
contrary
to
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
statute.
the
facts
here
can
be
briefly
stated.
as
i
noted
a
moment
ago,
the
respondents
have
participated
in
the
title
i
program
since
its
inception
in
1965.
in
the
early
1970's,
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
which
then
enforced
title
i,
performed
audits
of
the
new
jersey
program
for
fiscal
years
1971
through
1973
and
of
the
pennsylvania
program
for
fiscal
years
1968
through
1973.
in
the
final
audit
reports,
which
were
issued
in
1975,
hew
found
that
both
states
had
misapplied
significant
amounts
of
title
i
funds.
specifically
the
auditors
found
that
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
had
improperly
approved
lea
applications
for
use
of
title
i
funds
in
school
attendance
areas
that
didn't
contain
a
sufficiently
high
percentage
or
number
of
children
from
low
income
families
and
that
in
a
few
instances
title
i
funds
had
been
spent
for
general
aid
purposes
rather
than
targeted
to
meet
the
special
educational
needs
of
educationally
deprived
children.
both
states
challenged
these
findings
by
filing
applications
for
review
with
the
administrative
boards
set
up
in
hew
to
consider
title
i
claims
and
after
extensive
administrative
hearings,
the
educational
appeal
board
sustained
the
auditors
findings
in
large
part
and
ordered
new
jersey
to
repay
about
$1
million
and
pennsylvania
about
$400,000.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
oh,
yes.
the
initial
audit
report
was
something
like
$10
million,
i
believe,
but
after
pennsylvania
had
pursued
its
rights
through
the
various
levels
of
review,
the
final
recoupment
decision
was
to
recoup
$422,000
and
to
pay
that
money
to
the
office
of
education.
to
put
that
into
perspective,
by
the
way,
justice
rehnquist,
during
the
period
of
the
audit
here,
1968
through
1973,
for
pennsylvania,
pennsylvania
received
$365
million
in
title
i
funds.
respondents
then
sought
review
of
the
education
appeal
board's
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
vacated
the
board's
decision.
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
secretary
lacked
statutory
authority
to
order
the
repayment
of
this
misspent
funds
because
the
only
express
authorization
to
recoup
was
included
in
the
1978
amendments
to
title
i
and
relying
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
the
overarching
principle
of
this
court's
decision
in
pennhurst
state
school
against
halderman;
that
is
that
the
terms
and
conditions
of
a
federal
grant
must
be
clearly
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
regulations
authorizing
the
grant,
based
on
what
it
called
the
overarching
principle,
pennhurst
case.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
secretary
could
not
recoup
funds
misspent
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
1978
amendments.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
was
an
order
essentially
defining
the
amount
that
was
due
to
be
paid.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
the
secretary
hasn't
yet
decided
what
the
most
appropriate
way
would
be
to
collect
these
monies.
whether
if
pennsylvania
or
new
jersey
didn't
simply
send
the
check
or
a
portion
of
the
check,
a
portion
of
the
total
amount
over
several
years;
whether
some
sort
of
administrative
recoupment
would
be
feasible.
that
question...
that
is
one
of
the
questions
that
i
think
remains
to
be
resolved
on
remand.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
is
an
order
requiring
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
to
pay,
but
the
secretary
hasn't
yet--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
it
sets
the
amount
and
obviously--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
sets
the
amount
and
obviously
the
secretary
would
be
most
delighted
if
the
states
would
pay
that
full
amount,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
think
that
the
secretary
would
have
the
authority
under
the
federal
claims
collection
act
either
to
use
administrative
offset,
if
that
would
be
feasible,
and
we
submit
that
it
would
be
feasible
under
title
i,
or
to
bring
an
action
in
district
court
for
suit
on
the
prior
judgment
to
recover
that
amount
of
money.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
is
correct.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
administrative
determination
of
liability.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
it
is
not
so
clear
under
the
statute.
the
state
can
only
have
its
application
disapproved
if
it
is
currently
not
in
compliance
with
the
statute
and
not
for
past
non-compliance.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
whether
in
theory
that
is
a
possibility--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
states
can--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--would
have
to
sue
because
there
would
be
no
offset
possible
presumably
in
that
situation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
yes.
this
is
not
a
penalty.
this
is
just
a
restitution.
but,
it
is
not
simply
our
decision.
there
are
a
number
of
safeguards
in
the
system
to
make
certain
that
our
decision
is
a
correct
one.
there
is
an
initial
audit
report
which
the
states
can
challenge
and
then
there
is
a
final
audit
report
which
the
states
can
challenge
and
then
there
is
an
appeal
to
the
education
appeal
board
which
is
a
neutral
administrative
agency
composed
in
large
part
by
non-government
personnel.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
submits
an
application
simply
saying
that
it
will
abide
by
the
assurances...
it
will
abide
by
the
conditions
in
the
statute
and
regulations.
all
of
the
money
in
this
program
comes
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
in
this
case
particularly
i
don't
think
there
are
any
gray
areas
as
to
the
states'
non-compliance.
pennsylvania,
for
example--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
there
are
two
separate
questions
here.
one
is
should
the
state
have
known
that
it
was
violating
the
statute?
that
is
not
an
issue
that
is
before
the
court
right
now.
pennsylvania
didn't
even
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
had
violated
the
statute.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
should
the
states
have
known
that
if
they
were
found,
after
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings,
to
have
violated
the
statute,
should
they
have
known
that
a
remedy
that
the
secretary
could
have
pursued
was
to
recoup
the
misspent
funds?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
issue
is
not...
the
substantive
issue
of
whether
the
states
of
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
violated
the
statute
is
not
before
the
court.
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that
is
correct.
the
only
question
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
is
whether
if
the
state
has,
in
fact,
violated
the
statute,
does
the
secretary
have
available
to
him
the
remedy
of
recoupment?
let
me
say
that
these...
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
obscure
or
arcane
provisions
of
the
statute
or
regulations
that
the
states
couldn't
possibly
have
known
they
were
violating,
although
i
understand
that
the
states
attempt
to
paint
that
picture
in
their
brief.
we
are
dealing
here
with
requirements
in
the
statute
and
regulations
that
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
title
i
program.
as
i
said,
new
jersey
conceded
before
the
education
appeals
board
that
it
had,
in
fact,
violated
the
statute
by
miscalculating
the
amount
of
eligible...
number
of
eligible
school
attendance
areas.
and,
pennsylvania
didn't
even
challenge
the
finding
of
violation
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
have
admitted
they
have
violated
it
here.
but,
we
think
that
these
are
issues
that
remain
to
be
litigated
on
remand,
whether
the
state
violated
the
statute,
if
they
could
reraise
that
issue
not
having
raised
it
the
first
time
around.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
there
certainly
is
no
intent
element,
but
there
is
an
element
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
in
determining
whether
to
pursue
his
recoupment
remedy
and
there
have
been
instances,
including
one
that
is
cited
in
the
education
appeal
board's
decision
in
this
case,
in
which
a
state
may
have
relied
on
certain
program
directives
of
the
secretary
in
doing
certain
thing.
and,
even
if
that
might
have
violated
the
statute,
the
secretary
would
not
be
allowed
to
recoup.
but,
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
would
think
that
the
secretary's
discretion
to
recoup
would
be
reviewable
like
any
other
administrative
decision
on
an
arbitrary
or
carpricious
basis.
but,
if
there
has
been
a
clear
statutory
violation,
especially
if
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
statute
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
whole
title
i
program,
i
can't
imagine
how
any
decision
to
recoup
would
be
considered
arbitrary.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
there
certainly
is
nothing
and
that
is
to
be
encouraged.
in
fact,
the
third
circuit,
in
its
opinion,
refers
to
the
fact
that
lea's
and
sea's
frequently
do
that
and
the
secretary
is
only
too
happy.
this
is
not
a
penalty
program.
everyone
is
trying
to
accomplish
the
same
goal
here.
we
are
not
trying
to
catch
the
sea's
and
lea's
in
slip-ups.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
situation
in
which
it
has
been
determined
that
the
state
and
local
educational
agencies
in
the
past
have
misapplied
substantial
amounts
of
federal
funds
which
they
received
for
a
particular
purpose
but
didn't
use
for
that
purpose.
the
only
question
here
is
what
are
the
secretary's
remedies?
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
we
are
here...
i
think
there
is
some
confusion
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
states
at
least
as
to
what
its
concession
is.
pennsylvania
does
not
concede
that
prior
to
1978
any--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
new
jersey
has
in
its
brief
a
very
peculiar
suggestion
as
to
what
setoff
is.
let
me
give
the
court
some
round
numbers
so
we
can
all
understand
what
we
are
talking
about.
let's
assume
that
the
state
in
an
upcoming
fiscal
year
was
entitled
to
receive
$1
million
in
title
i
funds
and
let's
assume
that
the
secretary
has
determined
on
the
basis
of
substantial
evidence
that
in
the
past
that
state
has
misused
$10,000
of
title
i
funds.
what
new
jersey
is
suggesting
in
its
brief
is
that
the
secretary
should
simply
only
give
the
state
$990,000
of
title
i
funds
for
the
upcoming
fiscal
year
and
that
is
all
they
would
have
to
spend.
well,
that
is
not
a
setoff
at
all.
the
government
is
simply
repaying
itself
for
misused
money.
that
penalizes
title
i
beneficiaries,
the
low-income
children,
twice.
it
penalizes
them
once
when
the
funds
were
originally
misspend
and
it
penalizes
them
a
second
time
when
the
amount
of
money
being
provided
for
the
program
in
the
upcoming
fiscal
year
is
lower
than
it
should
be.
that
is
precisely
the
sort
of
setoff
that
the
third
circuit,
we
think
quite
correctly,
said
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
goals
of
the
title
i
program.
that
is
not
how
the
secretary
views
his
setoff
authority.
what
the
secretary
would
propose
to
do,
if
it
ever
came
to
an
administrative
setoff,
would
be
to
give
that
state
$990,000,
but
to
extract
a
commitment
from
the
state
to
spend
$1
million
that
year
in
the
title
i
program.
new
jersey
has
never
conceded
that
that
is
what
it
is
willing
to
do.
if
it
would,
then
we
would
not
be
here
as
to
new
jersey.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
we
have
argued
that
section
414,
which
provides
the
audit
authority,
and
section
415,
which
is
the
section
to
which
you
have
just
referred,
together
do
provide
explicit
authority.
and,
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1970
amendments
to
the
statute
which
put
those
sections
into
the
statute.
congress
quite
clearly
said
that
this
will
facilitate
the
secretary's
use
of
his
administrative
audit
and
recoupment
authority
under
the
education
statutes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
first
of
all,
let
me
say
the
situation
never
come
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
understand,
justice
rehnquist.
there
have
been
several
dozen
occasions
in
the
past
in
which
the
secretary
has
determined
that
a
state
has
misspent
past
grant
funds
and
they
have
always
paid
up,
but
in
the
situation
that
you
posited,
the
secretary
would
not
do
anything
that
would
jeopardize
the
title
i
program
in
that
state.
what
the
secretary
would
probably
do
in
that
situation
is
bring
a
suit
in
district
court
to
recover
on
the
judgment.
it
would
not
be
a
de
novo
action
to
reconsider
what--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
judgment
of
the
education
appeals
board
which
presumably
would
have
been
an
appeal
to
a
court
of
appeals
and
affirmed
such
as
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
i
think
it
can.
and,
in
fact,
that
happens
all
the
time
under
a
great
many
federal
programs,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
the
child
labor
act,
which
provide
for
civil
penalties
through
an
administrative
process
and
if
the
defendant
refuses
to
pay,
what
the
government
will
do
is
bring
a
civil
action
for
recovery
of
that
judgment.
that
is
very
common
administrative
procedure.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
would
assume
that
it
would
never
come
to
that.
that
is
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
the
third
circuit
found
that
prior
to
1978
we
had
no
right
to
do
that
and
that
is
why
this
case
is
here
and
why
this
case
is
of
tremendous
importance.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
that
the
third
circuit
misunderstood
what
the
secretary
was
trying
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think...
the
third
circuit
said
that
the
secretary
could
not
use
his
common
law
recoupment
authority
in
this
class
of
case
for
two
reasons.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it
is
not
dicta
because
judge
higginbotham
assumed
that
the
secretary
was
not
proceeding
under
his
common
law
recoupment
authority.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
believe
they
were,
justice
stevens.
i
believe
the
secretary
has
used
his
common
law
authority
as
codified
in
the
federal
claims
collection
act.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that
is
because
the
federal
claims
collection
act
requires
the
secretary
to
consider
a
number
of
options
in
determining
how
to
recovery
the
money
and
that
was
the
question
that
the
secretary
hadn't
yet
decided...
hadn't
yet
had
to
reach
because
the
states
had
not
yet
said
that
they
were
not
going
to
pay
the
money
if,
after
they
had
had
their
administrative
proceedings,
it
was
found
that
they
owed
it.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
is
more
than
an
i.o.u.
i
think
it
is
like
collecting
on
a
contract
that
has
been
breached.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no,
i
think
the
secretary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
secretary's
administrative
ruling
obviously
was
a
ruling
that
this
money
had
to
be
paid.
the
question
that
hadn't
yet
been
reached
is
whether,
for
example,
it
would
be
paid
in
installments,
it
would
be
paid
by
administrative
recoupment
from
the
upcoming
title
i
funding,
whether
if
none
of
those
were
feasible,
whether
it
would
be
the
subject
of
a
lawsuit
in
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
am
not
certain,
justice
marshall,
what
you
mean
by
an
i.o.u.
there
has
been
an
administrative
determination
here
after
full
evidentiary
proceedings
that
the
money
was
owed
and
what
the
states
have
done
is
taken
an
appeal
of
that
administrative
ruling
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
statutory
procedure
that
congress
set
up
in
1978.
and,
this
is
a
review.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
third
circuit's
decision
that
the
administrative
proceedings
were
erroneous
because
the
secretary
had
essentially
no
cause
of
action
prior
to
1978
to
proceed
either
administratively,
either
under
his
statutory
authority
or
under
his
common
law
authority
administratively.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
understand
that,
justice
stevens,
but
there
had
been
a
final
administrative
ruling
that
the
amounts
were
owed
and--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
that
is
what
we
are
reviewing
here,
whether,
in
fact,
the
secretary
had
any
power
to
order
these
states--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
as
an
audit
matter,
but
certainly
not
as
a
matter
of
power
to
order
a
recoupment
of
that
amount
of
money
and
that
is
what
is
before
the
court
at
the
moment.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
the
third
circuit
held
that
that
is
impermissible
in
the
context
of
the
title
i
program.
it
did,
i
think,
on
the
basis
of
two
misconceptions.
one
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i
believe
not,
justice
o'connor.
what
the
third
circuit
did
not
reach
but
suggested
that
the
secretary
might
be
able
to
do
is
to
bring
a
civil
action,
a
de
novo
civil
action
to
recover
this
money,
although
even
there
they
left
the
suggestion
open
that
prior
to
1978
there
would
be
no
authority,
no
cause
of
action
in
effect
to
bring
such
an
action.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think...
there
are
really
two
questions
here
and
they
are
separate.
i
think
the
court
has
to
keep
them
separate
as
it
analyzes
this
case.
the
first
question
is
prior
to
1978
did
the
secretary
have,
in
effect,
a
cause
of
action
to
recover
this
money
at
all?
respondents
are
quite
adamant
that
prior
to
1978
there
was
no
cause
of
action
available
to
the
secretary
to
recover
this
money.
the
second
question
is
if
there
was
a
cause
of
action
to
recover
the
money
prior
to
1978,
how
did
the
secretary
have
to
pursue
his
cause
of
action?
in
other
words,
could
he
do
it
through
administrative
procedures
or
offset?
the
third
circuit
clearly
answers
that
question
in
the
negative.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
offset
is
just
one
manner
of
achieving
a
recoupment.
it
is
our
principal
submission
that
the
federal
government,
when
it
makes
a
grant
subject
to
express
conditions
such
as
those
in
title
i,
has
an
inherent
right
to
recover
monies
expended
by
the
grantee
in
violation
of
the
express
conditions
of
the
grant
and
that
the
government
may
exercise
its
right
of
recoupment
by
offsetting
the
amounts
involved
against
sums
otherwise
due
to
the
grantee.
we
believe
that
conclusion
adheres
to
the
very
nature
of
the
grant
which,
as
this
court
said
in
pennhurst,
is
very
much
like
a
contract.
it
is
well
settled
in
cases
dating
back
more
than
a
century
in
this
court
that
the
government
may
recover
monies
without
resort
to
express
statutory
authority
when
it
is
paid
for
services
that
were
never
provided.
the
use
of
grant
funds
for
purposes
not
authorized
by
congress
constitutes
precisely
such
an
instance
of
non-performance
of
the
terms
of
an
agreement.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
at
that
point,
offset
would
not
be
available
because
no
future
funds
would
be
going
to
the
state
under
the
program.
and,
i
assume
that
the
secretary,
as
i
said
earlier,
would
have
to
bring
a
civil
suit
to
recover
on
the
judgment,
enter
in
the
administrative
proceedings.
but,
that
would
not
be
a
de
novo
review.
the
court
would
not
be
reconsidering
whether
the
statute
had
been
violated.
now,
let
me
just
briefly
in
the
short
time
remaining
explain
the
number
of
the
legislative
developments
which
we
think
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
secretary
had
this
authority
prior
to
1978.
first
of
all,
as
i
alluded
to
a
moment
ago,
there
was
a
long
history
of
administrative
recoupment
upheld
by
this
court
even
in
the
absence
of
express
statutory
authority.
but,
we
have
much
more
than
that
here.
we
have,
first
of
all,
the
1966
federal
claims
collective
act
which
was
passed
well
before
any
of
the
monies
in
this
case
were
misexpended
which
clearly
codifies
the
common-law
principles
and
says
that
the
federal
government
can
use
all
means
including
administrative
offset
to
recoup
debts
owed
to
it.
we
have
after
that
in
1970
the
statutes
that
justice
o'connor
alluded
to,
sections
414
and
415
of
the
general
education
provisions
act.
the
legislative
history
of
those
provisions
make
it
clear
once
again
that
congress
was
aware
that
the
secretary
had
been
exercising
his
audit
and
recoupment
authority
since
the
very
outset
of
the
program
in
1965.
two
years
later
in
1972
the
secretary
set
up
the
title
i
audit
hearing
board
to
consider
title
i
claims.
the
regulations
setting
up
that
board,
which
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
beginning
at
page
158,
quite
clearly
explain
that
the
secretary
will
be
engaging
in
audit
and
recoupment
functions.
and,
on
page
160
and
161,
it
is
made
quite
clear
that...
for
example,
no
action
will
be
taken
by
the
office
of
education
with
respect
to
the
collection
of
the
amounts
due
to
be
owing
if
there
has
been
a
claimed
filed.
this
is
in
1972,
once
again
a
clear
indication
of
the
secretary's
audit
and
collection
authority.
two
years
after
that,
in
1974,
congress
passes
20
usc
884,
a
statute
of
limitations
for
the
title
i
program,
saying
that
no
funds
can
be
recovered
unless
they
have
been
misspent
less
than
five
years
before
a
final
audit
determination.
there
would
have
been
absolutely
no
reason
for
congress
to
have
passed
the
statute
of
limitations
in
1974
for
purposes
of
the
title
i
program
if
respondents
were
right
that
until
1968,
1978
the
secretary
had
absolutely
no
authority
to
recover
any
funds
under
the
title
i
program.
respondents
have
never
given
any
convincing
explanation
of
what
the
1974
statute
of
limitations
was
intended
to
do
if
they
are
right
as
to
what
the
secretary's
powers
are.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
secretary
audits
every
state.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
every
three
years.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
every
three
years.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that
may
well
be
although
the
provisions
of
the
statute
and
regulations
are
not
as
obscure
as
the
respondents
would
have
the
court
believe.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't...
well,
let
me
say
this.
despite
the
impression
that
the
respondents
would
give--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
understand
that
justice
white,
but
it
is
important
to
understand,
especially
in
light
of
the
submission
respondents
have
made
to
this
court,
that
there
really
are
very,
very
few
requirements,
important
requirements,
imposed
on
the
states
by
title
i
in
the
statute
and
regulations
and
even
as
to
those
requirements,
there
are
very
few
that
the
auditors
are
concerned
about
and
the
violation
of
which
would
lead
to
a
recoupment.
now,
all
of
these
obscure
requirements
they
refer
to,
recordkeeping
and
all
the
rest,
those
are
not
the
sort
of
requirements
we
are
concerned
about
here.
the
title
i
statute
is
intended
to
supplement
the
regular
school
programs
of
educationally
deprived
children
in
low-income
areas.
all
that
the
auditors
are
concerned
about
are
whether
title
i
funds
are
being
used
to
supplement
rather
than
supplant
regular
school
programs,
whether
they
are
going
to
the
schools
that
were
intended
by
congress
and
whether
the
programs
are
being
targeted
to
educationally
deprived
children.
it
is
somewhat
ludicruous
in
a
case
like
this
where
new
jersey's
errors
in
failing
to
comply
with
the
statute
were
purely
mathematical,
miscomputations,
or
in
a
case
which
pennsylvania
did
not
even
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
had
violated
the
statute.
for
the
respondents
to
make
a
primary
submission
to
this
case
that
title
i
grant
recipients
just
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
requirements
of
the
statute
here
are.
finally,
in
just
going
through
this
legislative
history,
in
1978,
when
congress
finally
put
expressed
recoupment
authority
in
the
statute,
in
part
i
think
because
congress
was
concerned
that
the
secretary
hadn't
been
adamant
enough
in
pursuing
his
recoupment
authority,
the
legislative
history
again
makes
it
quite
clear
that
they
were
not
giving
the
secretary
any
new
powers.
we
quote
from
the
house
report
in
our
brief.
they
were
simply
reiterating
what
the
powers
were
that
the
secretary
already
had,
putting
in
a
new
procedural
framework
in
which
to
exercise
those
powers
and
granting
certain
additional
due
process
rights
to
the
grantees.
so,
we
think
it
is
inconceivable,
when
one
looks
at
the
history
of
the
entire
title
i
program
from
1965
on,
for
any
grantee
at
any
point
to
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
free
to
misspend
grant
funds
and
would
not
have
to...
would
not
run
any
risk
of
having
to
account
to
the
federal
government
for
the
amount
of
the
misused
funds.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
i
think
the
third
circuit...
i
had
trouble
with
that
portion
of
the
third
circuit's
opinion
as
well,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
what
the
third
circuit
must
have
meant
is
that
section
415
was
intended
for
the
situation
where
the
federal
government
accidentally
sends
more
money
to
the
state
in
one
year
than
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
title
i
program.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
misspending
of
money
by
the
states,
just
in
the
following
year
the
federal
government
might
be
able
to
make
that
up.
the
third
circuit
gave
a
very
bizarre
interpretation
of
section
414
and
415,
saying
that
those
were
just
informational
provisions
in
order
for
the
federal
government
to
be
able
to
gather
information.
it
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
those
provisions
which
explicitly
refers
to
the
secretary's
audit
and
recoupment
authority
from
1965
onward.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
depends
what
they
mean
by
recoup.
as
long
as
they
didn't
mean
what
new
jersey
meant.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
as
long
as
the
offset
is
what
new
jersey
takes
the
offset
to
mean
which
is
simply
to
reduce
the
amount
of
title
i
funding
in
the
future
but
not
requiring
the
states
to
make
up
the
difference.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
just
one
or
two
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
case
involves
in
many
ways
a
very
confusing
array
of
statutes
and
i
just
want
to
clarify
one
thing
that
respondent
pennsylvania
may
have
confused
in
our
discussion
of
the
withholding
remedy
under
the
pre-1978
statute
which
is
section
241j
of
title
xx.
that
remedy
only
applies
to
current
violations
of
the
act.
the
secretary
could
not
have
used
that
remedy
for
past
violations
of
the
act
and
it
is
an
extremely
drastic
remedy,
the
one
that
new
jersey
or
pennsylvania
was
suggesting
to
use,
because
prior
to
1978
all
of
the
funds
to
a
sea
or
a
lea
and
not
just
an
amount
that
is
equal
to
the
amount
of
past
misspent
funds
would
have
had
to
be
withheld
even
if
section
241j
were
to
cover
past
withholdings.
now,
secondly,
justice
stevens'
question,
there
is
no
question
that
there
was
an
order
to
repay
the
money.
the
only
thing
that
was
left
open
was
the
method
of
collection.
the
federal
government
has
been
proceeding
the
way
the
federal
claims
collection
act
expects
it
to
proceed.
in
other
words,
to
make
an
initial
request
for
repayment,
but
if
that
is
not
met
with
a
check
for
the
full
amount,
then
to
consider
a
number
of
other
options
as
to
how
to
collect
the
money.
and,
we
haven't
reached
that
point
yet
in
the
collection
process.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
i
think
even
if
your
question
were
correct
in
assuming
that
this
was
a
final
order
in
some
way,
that
would
simply
to
to
whether
the
education
appeal
board--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
the
follow-up
letters
make
quite
clear--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--they
are.
in
fact,
one--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--one
of
them
is
appended
to--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
to
inform
one's
self
of
what
the
secretary
means--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
now,
i
know...
i
can't
really
resist
the
temptation,
much
as
i
thought
i
should,
to
rebut
what
the
respondent
new
jersey
has
just
said
about
the
technicality
of
the
violations
here.
i
would
simply
refer
the
court
to
page
43a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
a
description
of
the
way
that
new
jersey
computed
the
amount...
the
number
of
its
eligible
schools
in
newark,
new
jersey,
including
certain
things
in
the
enumerator
of
a
fraction
but
not
in
the
denominator
and
as
a
result
having
a
great
extra
number
of
eligible
schools
in
the
new
jersey
school
district.
now,
finally,
i
would
just
like
to
refer
the
court
to
a
recent
decision
which
just
came
to
our
attention
a
few
days
ago.
it
is
a
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
decided
on
april
5th.
it
is
commonweath
of
kentucky
versus
donovan.
it
is
a
case
involving
the
ceta
program
but
in
many
ways
it
involves
the
issues
presented
here.
and,
the
sixth
circuit,
we
think
quite
correctly,
rejected
a
pennhurst
type
argument
that
a
state
did
not
have
to
pay
over
essentially
misspent
funds
because
the
particular
remedies
were
not
explicitly
stated
in
the
statute.
thank
you.
