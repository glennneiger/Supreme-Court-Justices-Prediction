chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
bell
against
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania.
mr.
geller,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything,
mr.
geller,
to
prevent
the
states
when
it
approaches
some
project
involving
expenditure
of
these
funds
and
they
think
they
might
be
in
the
gray
zone,
is
there
anything
to
prevent
them
from
submitting
the
question
to
the
secretary
in
charge
of
the
grants
and
saying,
may
we
spend
the
money
for
this
project
or
this
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
a
state
has
received
all
of
the
money,
has
it
in
hand,
has
spent
it
and
has
misspent
some
of
it
and
then
informs
the
secretary
that
they
want
to
withdraw
from
the
program.
what
is
the
remedy
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
then?

justice

ms.
hunting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
a
state,
when
it
receives
a
grant
from
the
federal
government
under
an
explicit
statute
bound
to
know
the
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
left
me
somewhat
confused
as
to
the
obligations
of
the
state.
let's
take
an
extreme
case.
the
state
gets
several
hundred
million
dollars
in
grants
for
this
program,
but
they
decide
that
the
governor
of
the
state
needs
an
official
residence
so
they
spend
a
million
dollars
to
provide
an
official
residence
for
the
governor
and
then
because
they
have,
as
some
of
the
seaboard
states,
they
have
got
water
available
they
buy
a
yacht
for
the
governor.
now,
are
you
suggesting
for
one
minute
seriously
that
the
federal
government
cannot
make
the
state
account
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
about
just
withholding
the
next
grant,
from
the
next
grant
that
they
receive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
there
was
an
invasion
as
you
call
it
that
way,
wasn't
there
an
invasion
by
the
state
into
the
pockets
of
the
federal
taxpayers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
cole?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
state...
the
federal
government
could
refuse
to
honor
any
future
grants
until
the
debt
was
satisfied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
correct
it
for
the
future
and
not
worry
about
the
past?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
would
make
any
difference
whether
you
were
dealing
with
a
yacht
case
or
misapplying
funds
from
one
program
to
some
other
perfectly
legitimate
program
of
the
state?
do
you
think
legally
for
the
purposes
you
are
here
there
is
any
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be...
in
your
view,
it
would
require
an
affirmative,
explicit
statute
to
create
that
and
that
common
law
or
debtor/creditor
standards
would
not
apply,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
your
view
of
the
pre-1978
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
in
your
view,
must
this
court
now
decide
whether
you
are
right
about
that
1978
amendment
and
the
legal
rights
of
the
two
parties
prior
to
1978?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
geller?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
resume
arguments
at
1:00.
