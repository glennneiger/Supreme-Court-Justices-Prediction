well,
mr.
geller,
it
is
a
little
hard
to
understand.
if
the
secretary
thinks
setoff
is
available
and
if
the
states
concede
that
it
is
available,
and
at
least
one
of
them
has,
why
isn't
that
a
solution
and
why
are
we
here?

does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you,
that
helps
clarify
it.
is
it
your
position
that
section
415
of
the
general
education
provisions
act,
which
provides
that
there
can
be
adjustments
for
overpayments,
provides
explicit
authority
for
setoff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
geller,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
certainly
can
be
interpreted
as
holding
that
it
permits
that
offset
against
perspective
grants
is
permissible
under
section
415.
and,
that
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
holding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
said
that
direct
recoupment
was
impermissible,
but
it
indicated
that
the
offset
would
be
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
geller,
i
do
have
one
more
inquiry,
if
i
may,
because
i
still
don't
understand
what
it
was
that
ca-3
was
talking
about.
in
its
opinion
it
said,
"we
are
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
department's
arguments
concerning
the
operative
effect
of
section
415.
"
"it
is
clear
that
whatever
adjustments
are
authorized
under
this
provision,
they
are
to
be
accomplished
by
means
of
an
offset
against
current
or
perspective
grant
disbursements.
"
"the
department's
actions
in
this
case
are
very
much
different
and
it
can't,
therefore,
invoke
the
authority.
"

ms.
hunting,
before
you
get
to
another
point,
how
is
it
that
you
think
that
section
415
couple
with
the
claims
collection
act
provided
no
remedy
for
the
federal
government
before
1978?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
the
general
education
provisions
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
expressly
allows
adjustments
for
overpayments
and
that
coupled
with
the
claims
collection
act
would
appear
to
have
provided
some
pre-1978
remedies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
is
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
put
that
kind
of
a
gloss
on
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
any
reason
why
it
shouldn't?
i
mean,
what
is
the
fundamental
different
between
some
kind
of
accidental
overpayment
versus
the
kind
of
thing
that
happened
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
don't
need
to
reach
that
question
if
we
were
to
find
that
the
statutory
authority
before
1978
authorized
some
kind
of
recovery,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
i
guess
the
main
thrust
of
the
court
of
appeals'
reason
for
not
finding
the
pre-1978
authority
was
its
view
that
if
it
had
existed
the
1978
legislation
would
not
have
been
necessary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
perhaps
that
argument
isn't
correct
either
if
there
is
a
difference
between
offset
and
outright
recovery
in
some
other
fashion.
