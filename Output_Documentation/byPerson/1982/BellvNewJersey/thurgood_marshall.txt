mr.
geller,
isn't
this
like
collecting
on
an
i.o.u.
which
i
always
thought
you
couldn't
collect
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
that
the
only
ruling
was
was
that
you
owe
this
money,
not
that
you
must
pay
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
to
me
is
an
i.o.u.--
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
these
details
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
to
worry
us
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
we
have
to
decide
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
there
is
something
we
do
have
to
decide.
assuming
that
everything
the
government
says
on
the
facts
is
correct,
that
the
money
was
not
used
properly
and
according
to
law,
how
can
i
get
my
tax
money
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
the
federal
government
gave
new
jersey
the
money
to
do
with
as
they
pleased?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
the
federal
government
is
going
after
the
state
treasury.
i
think
the
federal
government
is
going
after
its
money
which
the
state
treasury
took.
