ms.
margaret
hunting
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
briefs
in
this
case,
there
has
been
some
strong
language
used
to
characterize
pennsylvania's
program
in
an
effort
to
justify
the
severe
and
unauthorized
penalty
which
is
now
seeks
to
impose.
i
want
to
make
to
day
only
three
points
with
respect
to
his
challenge.
my
first
point
is
that
pennsylvania
conducted
its
title
i
program
in
good
faith
and
this
is
not
a
case,
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
where
we
should
have
known
that
we
were
in
violation
of
a
set
of
complex
regulations.
ms.
margaret
hunting
your
honor,
we
agree
with
that.
the
state
was...
and
this
is
my
third
point,
which
is
that
the
state
was
under
an
explicit
statute
and
that
we
were
entitled
to
rely
on
that
statute
not
only
for
our
responsibilities,
but
also
for
the
extent
of
our
liabilities.
in
connection
with
that
also,
i
want
to
make
one
other
point
which
is
that
when
a
title
i
program
is
out
of
compliance,
the
statute
gives
the
state
an
opportunity
to
correct
that
program
before
the
imposition
of
any
penalty
and
that
penalty
can
be
lifted
upon
the
correction
of
the
program.
this
is
part
of
the
statute
and
has
been
ignored.
that
opportunity
has
been
denied
in
this
case.
as
to
our
first
point,
regarding
our
actual
program,
i
would
like
to
make...
point
out
one
thing,
that
as
mr.
geller
observed,
this
statute
envisioned
a
partnership
between
the
state
educational
agency
and
the
federal
agency
in
operating
and
administering
this
grant.
instead
of
a
partnership
which
is
cooperative
with
complimentary
responsibilities
and
liabilities,
the
federal
agency's
policy
of
pursuing
an
unauthorized
repayment
authority
which
it
claims
to
exist
is
a
divisive
and
conflicting
method
of
enforcing
this
program
which
is
causing
the
states
and
the
federal
government
to
fall
apart
in
confusion
in
battling
over
little
petty
disputes
and
interpretations
which
could
be
resolved
and
should
be
resolved
for
the
benefit
of
the
program.
ms.
margaret
hunting
the
amounts
are
not
petty,
your
honor.
they
are
definitely
not
petty.
this
case
originally
was
a
$10.5
million
audit
as
was
pointed
out
earlier.
ms.
margaret
hunting
but,
the
disputes
themselves
can
result
in
petty
bickering
which
divides
us
on
the
question
of
interpretation
and
makes
administration
of
the
program
extremely
difficult.
for
example...
and,
i
wish
to
dispute
at
this
point
the
characterization
that
we
haven't
challenged
our
facts
with
respect
to
this
case.
we
have
not
specifically
talked
about
the
facts
before
the
third
circuit,
but
we
have
challenged
the
procedures
used
to
find
those
facts
and,
therefore,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
facts
have
accurately
been
found.
in
our
particular
case,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
agency
was
demanding
a...
the
federal
agency
is
demanding
reimbursement
for
a
school
district
operated
program
where
the
title
i
program
was
being
operated
at
the
same
time
as
a
busing
for
desegregation
program
was
being
operated.
in
this
particular
circumstance,
there
was
a
lot
of
confusion,
and
this
is
just
an
example
of
our
type
of
case,
a
lot
of
confusion
about
the
eligibility
of
students
who
were
being
bused
from
an
eligible
area
into
an
illegible
area.
both
the
federal
and
the
state
administrators
were
confused
on
this
subject
and
when
the
state
sought
advice,
which
was
recommended
in
a
suggestion
by
this
court
just
a
few
moments
ago
that
advice
be
sought
from
the
federal
officials,
when
the
state
sought
this
advice,
the
federal
officials
were
unclear
as
to
how
to
handle
the
situation.
they
admitted
that
they
had
confusion
in
their
own
office
and
that
there
was
a
philosophical
gulf
dividing
them
on
how
to
handle
this
particular
situation.
we
tried
to
follow
what
direction
we
could
get.
we
implemented
a
program
and
the
panel
itself
declared
that
this
program
was
exemplary,
the
panel
that
heard
this
case.
however,
when
the
auditors
came
out
to
review
the
program,
they
found
that
the
program
was
out
of
compliance
with
these
regulations
and,
therefore,
a
decision
was
made
regarding
a
difficult
issue,
which
administrators
and
educators
could
not
agree
on,
by
a
group
of
auditors
who
were
not
trained
in
the
law
or
in
education.
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
this
is
not
the
type
of
program
that
we
should
have
known
was
in
violation.
ms.
margaret
hunting
your
honor,
i
wish
to
give
you
this
characterization
of
our
case
in
order
to
refute
some
of
the
challenges
that
have
been
made
and
some
of
the
language
that
has
been
used,
that
we
have
converted
funds,
that
we
have
squandered
money,
because
this
is
certainly
not
the
case.
i
don't
think
it
ever
has
been
disputed--
ms.
margaret
hunting
--i
will
go
on
with
my
next
point.
ms.
margaret
hunting
we
took
the
same
position,
your
honor.
we
didn't
talk
about
the
facts
in
the
third
circuit
because
we
stressed
the
point
at
that
time
that
the
procedures
were
unfair
and
that
the
facts
were
not
properly
arrived
at.
and,
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
title
i
that
this
is
an
evolving
program
and
this
kind
of
an
example
can
show
how
it
is
evolving
and
the
statute
is
perfectly
reasonable
in
not
assigning
liability
and
not
requiring
the
states
to
underwrite
this
kind
of
evolution
of
a
program.
ms.
margaret
hunting
your
honor,
i
think
the
remedy
is
contained
in
the
statute
for
the
way
the
federal
government
should
handle
that
kind
of
case.
ms.
margaret
hunting
it
should
follow
the
statutory
penalties
of
withholding
or
application
disapproval.
the
withholding
penalty
can
be
a
very
effective
remedy
for
the
federal
government.
ms.
margaret
hunting
no,
your
honor,
and
it
is
particularly
improper
because
they
want
to
couple
that
with...
that
power
to
offset
with
an
order
that
the
state
make
up
the
difference
and
that
the--
ms.
margaret
hunting
--no,
your
honor.
we
feel--
ms.
margaret
hunting
--well,
i
don't
believe
they
are
irrelevant
because
in
this
case
it
is
a
case
of
good
faith.
ms.
margaret
hunting
under
our
argument,
we
would
win
no
matter
what
the
facts
are,
your
honor,
because
there
was
no
assignment
of
liability
in
that
statute.
even
if
the
conduct
was
criminal,
the
state
treasury
was
not
responsible
for
this.
but,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
federal
government
or
the
state
could
go
against
the
individuals
responsible
for
the
criminal
conduct
and
achieve
reimbursement
that
way
or
it
doesn't
mean
that
if
the
penalties
provided
in
the
statute
were
not
sufficient
to
enforce
the
statute
that
the
federal
government
couldn't
go
and
seek
stronger
penalties
to
be
written
into
the
act
as
they
eventually
were
in
1978
or,
as
it
suggests
itself
in
its
own
brief,
that
they
could
switch
to
a
penalty...
to
a
reimbursement
system
instead
of
having
a
forward
paid
system
and,
therefore,
if
the
state
continued
to
misspend
funds
they
could
just
fail
to
reimburse
them.
ms.
margaret
hunting
your
honor,
the
state...
we
would
dispute
that
the
state's
treasury
was
responsible
for
that
misexpenditure.
absolutely
the
government
could
pursue
with
criminal
penalties
for
civil
fraud,
for
reversionary
interest
in
these
items
that
were
purchased.
ms.
margaret
hunting
well,
if
the
program
continued
to
be
misadministered,
then
they
could
withhold
from
the
next
grant.
but,
we
submit
that
the
treasury
has
never
been
made
liable,
the
state's
treasury
has
never
been
made
liable,
has
never
been
required
to
underwrite
criminal
conduct
or
fraud
or
any
other...
or
just
doubt
as
to
how
to
administer
the
program
or
any
other
misexpenditure
in
this
grant.
and,
i
will
explain
in
my
second
point
why
that
is
a
fair
result.
ms.
margaret
hunting
section
415
is
the--
ms.
margaret
hunting
--that
is
the
payment
provision
of
the--
ms.
margaret
hunting
--we
have
to
agree
with
the
third
circuit
and
with
mr.
geller's
position
on
that,
that
that
relates
to
overpayments,
meaning
accidental
payments
to
the
states
that
were
in
excess
of
what
the
state
was
entitled
to
or
perhaps
a
situation
where
a
program
did
not
need
to
expend
all
of
its
funds
for
some
reason,
a
teacher
didn't
show
up
or
something.
this
would
be
what
we
consider
an
overpayment.
it
doesn't
relate
to
grant
misexpenditures.
ms.
margaret
hunting
the
third
circuit
noticed
that
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
legislative
history
on
this
point
as
to
exactly
what
legislative
history
attached
to
that.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
section
applies
to
the
kind
of
offset
that
we
are
talking
about
here.
it
talks
about--
ms.
margaret
hunting
--your
honor,
i
think
that
provision,
as
the
third
circuit
noted,
is
talking
in
terms
of
adjustments
of
grants
in
a
bookkeeping
kind
of
situation
like
that.
it
would
not
apply
in
this
sort
of
situation
because
in
this
situation
the
federal
government
is
asking
for
a
reimbursement
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
asking
for
offset,
the
offset
is
being
coupled
with
an
invasion
of
the
state's
and
its
localities'
educational
programs
by
the
federal
government
to
direct
them
how
to
spend
their
money.
ms.
margaret
hunting
your
honor,
initially
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
case
is
not
a
case
of
willful
disregard
of
the
regulations;
that
this
case
is
a
case
where
we
attempted
at
all
times
to
put
on
a
good
program
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
a...
i
believe
that
congress
has
the
right
to
decide
and
its
decision
should
be
given
authority
that
when
it
assigns
liability
for
a
program,
and
in
this
case
it
did
not
assign
liability
to
the
state,
that
that
decision
should
be
put
in
effect.
the
state,
i
believe,
as
the
grantee
is
entitled
to
rely
on
the
terms
of
the
grant.
and,
in
this
particular
case,
the
grant
guaranteed
to
the
states
an
opportunity
to
correct
its
program
and
to
lift
the
enforcement
mechanism
when
its
program
was
brought
into
compliance.
the
statutory
provision
of
withholding
can
only
be
applied
until
the
grant
program
is
brought
into
compliance
and
this
is
not
a
discretionary
provision
of
the
statute
that
requires
the
agency
to
notify
the
states
of
the
problem
and
then
it
requires
the
agency
to
lift
that
enforcement
provision
and
refund
the
program
when
the
program
is
in
compliance.
this
is
a
benefit.
this
obviously
is
designed
to
benefit
the
program.
it
is
a
positive,
therapeutic
method
of
enforcing
the
program
and
it
was
the
will
of
congress
that
this
is
the
method
to
be
used.
instead,
the
agency
has
ignored
this
particular
remedy,
has
not
ever
used
it
and
has
ignored
its
obligation
under
the
remedy
which
is
to
give
timely
advice
and
then
to
exercise
the
penalty.
this
is
coupled
with
a
notice
to
the
states
that
this
program
is
out
of
compliance
and
gives
it
an
opportunity
to
identify
what
is
wrong
with
the
program
and
then
to
correct
it.
instead,
what
the
federal
government
has
done
has
been
to
give
the
notice
to
the
state
at
the
same
time
it
gives
the
retroactive
penalty.
this
is
the
complete
opposite
of
the
point
that
congress
was
trying
to...
the
scheme
that
congress
was
trying
to
effect
in
creating
a
withholding
remedy.
and,
all
of
this,
this
imposition
of
this
penalty,
was
done
not
only
without
statutory
authorization
but
not
even
with
regulatory
powers
being
assigned
by
its
own
regulating
power
in
this
case.
the
federal
government
had
no
regulations.
even
a
hearing
board
was
not
created
by
regulations
but
was
merely
the
subject
of
a
notice
in
the
federal
register.
my
third
point
is
that
the
states
are
entitled
to
rely
on
the
terms
of
the
statute
when
they
accept
the
grant.
the
statute
has
assigned
not
only
the
responsibilities,
but
the
liabilities
that
pertain
to
the
state
in
administering
this
program.
it
is
not
only
our
liability,
but
the
federal
government's
responsibility
which
is
defined
in
the
enforcement
provisions
of
this
act.
it
is
not
unreasonable
that
congress
should
have
assumed
that
the
enforcement
scheme,
structure,
into
the
act
would
be
sufficient
to
manage
this
program.
congress
has
not
been
proved
wrong
in
this
regard.
there
has
been
no
evidence
of
purchases
of
yachts
or
purchases
of
governors'
mansions.
ms.
margaret
hunting
it
looks...
the
document
that
we
received
is
a
letter
that
compels...
it
states
the
amount
that
is
owed.
it
says
we
are
to
repay
it
and
for
every
day
we
don't
repay
it
interest
is
assessed.
ms.
margaret
hunting
yes.
ms.
margaret
hunting
so,
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
make
just
three
basic
points;
that
when
a
state
accepts
a
grant,
it
is
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
statute
in
effect
at
the
time
it
accepts
the
grant
to
determine
its
liability
and
to
determine
the
extent
of
its
liabilities.
for
the
federal
agency
to
go
outside
the
statute
denies
the
state
its
rights
under
it.
thank
you.
