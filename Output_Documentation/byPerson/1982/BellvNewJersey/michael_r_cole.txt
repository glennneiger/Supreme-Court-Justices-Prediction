mr.
michael
r.
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
a
number
of
questions
asked
of
ms.
hunting
and
particularly
justice
stevens'
last
question,
we
had
been
under
the
assumption
in
the
third
circuit
that
we
were
appealing
an
order
to
pay
money.
i
don't
think
the
federal
government,
the
secretary
ever
disabused
us
of
that
notion.
indeed,
as
ms.
hunting
points
out,
both
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
the
state
of
pennsylvania
received
letters
with
the
final
administrative
determination
saying
you
shall
please
send
us
your
check
and
for
each
day
that
you
delay
we
will
tack
on
interest
at,
i
think,
an
average
annual
rate
of
about
12
%.
it
wasn't
until
this
court
through
the
solicitor
general's
brief
the
secretary
suggested
that
that
was
just
an
initial
step.
so,
i
think
it
is
important
to
start
the
analysis
of
the
third
circuit's
decision
with
precisely
what
that
court
had
before
it.
it
had
before
it
challenges
to...
orders
from
the
secretary
that
we
characterized
as
orders
that
state
funds
be
used
to
pay
deficiencies
found
in
order
determination.
and,
it
was
in
that
setting
that
the
third
circuit
looked
to
title
i
as
it
was
in
place
in
the
years
in
question.
and,
for
new
jersey,
that
is
really
federal
fiscal
years
1970,
1971,
and
1972,
to
determine--
mr.
michael
r.
cole
--i
believe
they
are,
justice.
i
am
quite
sure
they
are.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
the
orders
themselves...
you
are
quite
right...
say
their
determination
is
new
jersey
should
pay.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
but,
the
letters
that
accompany
them...
and
i
think
we
may
have
quoted
from
the
letters
in
our
brief.
the
letters
accompanying
them
said,
please
remit
your
check
and
also
stated
that
interest
would
be
assessed.
so,
the
question
before
the
third
circuit
was
did
title
i
permit
the
secretary
to
require
an
expenditure
of
state
funds
as
a
result
of
an
order
of
determination.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
i
think
you
would
strain
the
language
of
the
statute
as
it
existed
in
1978,
chief
justice.
the
statute
allowed
the
federal
government
to
withhold
future
grant
loans
and
also
to
suspend
payments
until
you
brought
yourself
into
compliance.
now,
i
have
always
construed
that
to
mean
that
you
cured
any
past
failing
and
that
there
was
a
recordkeeping--
mr.
michael
r.
cole
--that
is
correct.
our
essential
argument
and
that
was
adopted
by
the
third
circuit
is
that
this
statute,
if
it
allocates
any
risk
of
mistake
at
all
by
its
silence,
must
allocate
that
risk
of
loss
by
mistake
to
the
federal
government,
not
to
the
state
treasury.
and,
the
third
circuit
found
that
because
there
is
no
unequivocal
statement
of
congressional
intent
that
the
state
should
be
underwriting
this
program
in
terms
of
bearing
the
risk
of
loss.
we
are
not
dealing
with
a
yacht
case
here
and
i
understand
that
the
facts
are
not
before
you.
but,
i
think
the
new
jersey
case
shows
you,
you
know,
what
type
of
mistake
we
are
dealing
with.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
not
for
the
purposes
of
our
argument.
it
makes
no
difference,
because
our
argument
says
that
the
state
treasury
is
not
exposed.
we
don't
have
to
address
the
yacht
hypothetical
or
the
governor's
mansion
hypothetical
to
make
a
determination
whether
individuals
may
be
exposed.
but,
the
state
treasury
is
not
exposed
under
the
statute
prior
to
the
1978
amendments.
and,
we
say
that
because
congress
has
not
given
a
clear,
unequivocal
indication
that
the
states
were
to
assume
this
risk
when
entering
into
the
program.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
that
is
correct,
chief
justice,
because
we
are
dealing
in
a
grant
area
and
we
are
dealing
with
a
principle,
if
not
directly
on
point,
at
least
sufficiently
analogous
to
the
principle
this
court
adopted
in
the
pennhurst
decision,
that
the
conditions...
we
are
dealing
in
an
area
that
makes
it
like
a
contract.
you
have
got
to
set
forth
your
conditions
clearly,
unequivocally,
or
the
states
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
any
ambiguity
there.
i
would
also
point
out
under
common
law,
the
third
circuit
never
reached
the
question
of
what
common
law
rights,
if
any,
the
government
had.
it
merely
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
government
could
administratively
make
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
you
had
spent
money
properly.
and,
having
made
that
determination,
whether
it
could
order
you
to
repay
it
either
directly...
and,
i
suspect
they
would
make
the
same
determination
as
to
mr.
geller's
proposed
variance
of
offset
which
says
you
don't
have
to
pay
it
directly
but
you
have
to
pay
it
indirectly
because
you
have
to
underwrite
the
cost
of
the
title
i
program.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
you
are
quite
right.
that
is
what
i
said,
you
know,
pennhurst
is
analogous.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
it
is
not
directly
on
point,
because
you
are
talking
about
imposition
of
an
affirmative
obligation.
we
are
talking
about
the
imposition
of
a
risk.
but,
we
submit
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
a
remedy
or
an
affirmative
undertaking
in
the
pennhurst
analysis.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
the
answer
to
your
question
is
i
don't
think
that
is
clear,
justice,
because
this
allocation
of
risk
to
the
states,
either
by
way
of
liability
of
a
private
action
as
the
court
addressed
in
rosado
or
in
liability
in
order
determination.
there
is
something
that
doesn't
follow
as
night
to
day.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
if
i
may,
justice
rehnquist,
here
is
where
i
think
you
should
understand
what
is
involved
in
the
new
jersey
case
and
why
we
are
talking
about
it
in
terms
of
risk.
title
i,
its
basic
policy
was
to
address
the
needs
of
the
educationally
deprived
student
and
because
of
the
relationship
with
low
income
and
educational
privation
it
targeted...
title
i
funds
were
to
be
targeted
to
areas
where
there
was
a
high
concentration
of
low-income
students.
now,
newark...
we
were
here
in
newark
and
we
were
disallowed
in
newark
precisely
because
newark
is
too
poor.
what
you
had
in
newark
is
you
had
a
unique
circumstance
of
an
impoverished
city
with
a
high
incidence
throughout
its
district
of
low-income
population
and
you
had
the
problem
of
incomplete
statistics.
i
think
everybody
recognized
that
we
didn't
follow
the
normal
federal
approach
to
determining
eligibility.
but,
even
the
secretary
recognizes
that
we
shouldn't
have
followed
that
approach
in
the
case
of
newark
because
the
statistics
you
needed
were
simply
not
available.
so,
everybody
recognized
you
had
to
have
an
alternative
approach
and
the
dispute
here
is
whether
the
alternative
approach
for
calculation
that
we
used
is
acceptable.
the
secretary
found
it
was
not.
the
secretary
opted
for
a
more
conservative
approach
than
that
that
had
been
done
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
on
recalculation
and
by
the
district
in
the
first
instance.
secondly,
what
is
at
dispute
here
is
whether
the
entire
newark
school
district
should
have
been
declared
a
title
i
district.
the
areas,
the
attendance
areas
that
the
secretary
is
disallowing
in
this
audit,
in
some
of
them
only
one
out
of
every
three
students
on
the
secretary's
own
numbers
is
a
afdc
recipient.
i
think
that
is
true
in
five
areas--
mr.
michael
r.
cole
--no,
you
don't,
justice,
but
what
i
am
pointing
out--
mr.
michael
r.
cole
--justice
marshall,
our
position
on
that
is
that
the
federal
government
made
the
choice
initially
that
there
should
be
no
recoupment
in
the
sense--
mr.
michael
r.
cole
--without
exposing
the
new
jersey
treasury
to
risk,
yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
that
is
correct,
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
if
the
federal
government
is
not
pursuing
a
course
of
action
that
would
affirmatively
impose
obligations
on
the
state
treasury,
the
answer
is
no.
but,
as
i
understand
the
position
on
offset,
they
would
want
the
state
treasury
to
make
up
the
difference
in
the
loss
of
grant
funds.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
with
respect,
justice
marshall,
that
would
be
true
if
we
had
that
money.
that
money
has
been
spent.
it
has
been
spent
on
children.
so,
in
fact,
they
are
going
after
the
state
treasury.
i
started
to
say
before
in
common
law
the
third
circuit
never
decided
what,
if
any,
common
law
rights
the
federal
government
had
against
the
state
government.
i
would
point
out
on
that
score
that
all
the
cases
cited
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
involve
individuals
or
involve
situations
where
a
particular
program
has
a
regulatory
scheme
in
effect
which
imposes
that
liability.
i
know
of
no
case
where
common
law
rights
against
state
government
have
been
found
other
than
the
west
virginia
case
where
it
was
a
non-explained
dictum.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
no,
you
do
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
that
is
correct.
they
could
not
find...
i
believe
it
is
section
185...
would
have
served
any
purpose
had
the
authority
had
existed
as
the
federal
government
has
alleged.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
that
is
true,
but
from
our
standpoint,
we
take
the
view
that
the
third
circuit
probably
concluded
that
there
were
no
affirmative
funding
obligations
on
the
state
prior
to
1978.
under
common
law,
i
would
make
one
last
point
and
of
course,
we
all
know
that
in
common
law
the
principle
of
sovereign
immunity
extends
to
state
governments
as
well
as
the
federal
government
so
it
is
somewhat
anomalous
to
talk
about
the
federal
government
being
in
the
same
position
vis
a
vis
the
state
as
a
private
creditor
at
common
law,
wherein
common
law
that
private
creditor
would
have
had
no
rights
whatsoever
against
the
state
government
because
of
sovereign
immunity.
just
very
briefly
in
summary
we
say
that
the
legislation
that
existed
for
title
i
prior
to
1978
did
not
impose
any
risk
on
state
treasury.
in
addition,
there
were
no
regulations
adopted
by
the
secretary
which
assumed
that
he
had
this
authority
or
intended
to
impose
it.
the
first
regulations
were
adopted
after
1978.
the
secretary's
regulations
prior
to
that
time
with
respect
to
title
i
referenced
only
the
withholding
and
the
suspension
of
funding
as
remedies
for
violations
of
any
assurance
given.
so,
it
is
a
case
where
the
secretary
did
not
by
regulation
assert
the
power.
the
statute,
we
say
on
its
face,
does
not
provide
for
the
remedy
the
secretary
seeks
to
invoke
and
for
that
reason
and
as
a
matter
of
fairness
this
court
should
not
find
that
the
state
treasury
is
liable
for
any
misexpenditures
prior
to
1978.
after
1978
the
problem
does
not
exist
because
congress
has
affirmatively
provided
the
authority
the
secretary
seeks
to
exercise.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
not
prior
to
1978.
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
i
don't
think
the
withholding
or
suspension...
i
think
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
that
provision.
what
they
could
do
is
the
change
of
state
from
a
grants
funding
program
to
a
reimbursement
program
and,
therefore,
really
strictly
police
its
expenditures
in
the
future.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
well,
the
position
that
we
took
in
our
brief
is
that
they
have
some
offset
authority.
mr.
michael
r.
cole
under
that
position,
yes.
