justice

white
and
surely
the
secretary
could
terminate
the
state's
participation
in
the
program
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
part
of
its
duty
though
is
to
repay
and
it
refuses
to
repay.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
just
says,
well,
if
this
is
the
way
you
are
going
to
interpret
the
statute
and
our
agreement,
we
just
want
to
quit.
i
suppose
they
could
quit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
secretary
would
have
to
sue.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
whether
or
not...
whether
or
not
the
states'
position
is
arguable
in
the
sense
that
arguably
and
reasonably
it
might
have
believed
it
was
not
violating
the
statute;
that
you
have
the
right
to
recoup
if
you
decide
retrospectively
that
is
what
the
contract
means
or
that
statute
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
kind
of
program
where
the
state
initially
submits
a
plan
and
it
is
approved?
justice
byron
r.
white
another
thing,
would
you
think
that,
to
put
it
crudely,
would
any
fool
have
known
that
the
state
was
not
in
compliance
or
is
it
a
close
case?
is
it
a
gray
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
say
the
states
should
have
known.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
just
so
happened
that
a
majority
of
the
court
thought
that
if
the
state
should
have
known
why
then
it
should
pay
the
money
back?
but,
if
it
was
just
arguable,
it
may
not
have
ever
participate
in
the
program
if
it
had
known
those
were
the
conditions.
what
if
the
majority
of
the
court
felt
that
way?
i
guess
that
issue
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
understand
that.
and,
neither
is,
i
guess,
whether
or
not
the
states
should
or
should
not
have
known
that
it
was
violating
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
understand
what
you
are
arguing
now,
you
wouldn't
take
it
in
this
then
if
the
court...
suppose
we
held
for
you
in
this
case--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
if
we
reserved
the
question...
what
if
we
said
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
where
the
state
knew
or
should
have
known
that
it
was
violating
the
statute
and
they
admitted
they
violated
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
geller,
does
the
secretary
audit
every
single
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
three
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
a
state
may
not
even
know
that
it
is
in
violation
until
there
is
an
audit
which
may
be
three
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
in
this
case--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
what
if
they
really
were
obscure?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
i
don't
suppose
every
auditor
has
the
same
view
as
another
auditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
geller,
suppose
the
third
circuit
had
said
that
you
could
recoup
by
offset?
you
probably
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
they
had
held
that
you
could
recoup
by
offsetting
these
misspent
funds
against
future
funds?
