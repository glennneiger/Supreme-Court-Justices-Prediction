mr.
dane
r.
gillette
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--the
date
of
the
criminal
act
was
july
the
7th,
1976.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
reversed
respondent
joseph
slappy's
1976
california
state
convictions
for
rape,
forcible
oral
copulation,
robbery,
burglary,
and
false
imprisonment,
because
it
concluded
that
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
been
violated.
we
submit
that
the
result
is
an
unwarranted
expansion
of
the
sixth
amendment
based
in
part
upon
a
misreading
of
the
state
trial
record.
in
addition,
we
submit
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
unfairly
criticized
the
state
trial
judge
for
failing
to
conduct
an
inquiry
that
was
not
reasonably
required
by
the
record
before
it.
the
facts
of
the
crime
can
be
quickly
summarized.
mr.
slappy
first
accosted
the
victim
early
on
the
morning
of
july
7th,
1976,
in
a
liquor
store
in
san
francisco.
after
being
ordered
to
leave
the
store,
slappy
went
to
the
apartment
building
where
the
victim
lived,
and
there
he
waited
in
the
lobby
until
she
returned
home.
when
she
entered
the
building,
slappy
grabbed
her,
forced
her
into
the
basement,
and
there
stole
her
jewelry
and
committed
the
sex
offenses.
after
the
victim
managed
to
escape
from
slappy,
she
almost
immediately
found
a
police
officer
and
gave
him
a
description
of
her
assailant.
mr.
slappy
was
arrested
two
blocks
from
the
apartment
building
and
approximately
15
minutes
later.
he
was
wearing
a
distinctive
afro
wig
such
as
the
victim
had
described,
and
was
wearing
a
distinctive
green
jacket
such
as
the
victim
had
described.
in
his
pockets--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--none,
your
honor.
there
has
never
been
a
challenge
either
in
the
california
courts
or
in
the
federal
courts
on
habeas
corpus
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
these
convictions.
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
are
talking
about
the
scales
of
justice
being
poised
between
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
slappy
is
clearly
guilty,
and
the
only
real
issue
is
whether
he
received
a
fair
trial.
now,
the
more
critical
facts
which
pertain
to
the
issues
before
this
court
are
those
which
relate
to
his
relationship
with
the
attorney
who
represented
him
at
trial.
at
his
initial
arraignment
in
municipal
court,
the
san
francisco
public
defender's
office
was
appointed
to
represent
mr.
slappy.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that
arraignment...
i
don't
know
the
precise
date,
your
honor.
it
would
have
been
within
a
day
or
two
of
july
the
7th.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
well,
the
facts
relating
to
the
crime
and
the
time
and
that
such
were
not
initially
before
the
court
because
they
had
never
been
presented
to
the
lower
federal
courts.
however,
the
complete
transcripts
of
both
this...
well,
of
the
two
trials,
because
there
was
a
mistrial
as
to
two
of
the
counts,
have
been
submitted
to
the
court.
they
were
lodged
last
week
per
your
request.
as
to
some
of
those
other
points,
for
example,
mr.
goldfine's
hospitalization,
the
reason
that
is
not
in
the
record
is
a
point
that
i
will
get
to
in
just
a
moment,
if
i
may.
now,
after
the
san
francisco
public
defender
was
appointed
to
represent
mr.
slappy,
he
assigned
harvey
goldfine
to
represent
him,
and
mr.
goldfine
conducted
the
preliminary
examination,
and
he
also
conducted
what
was
later
described
as
a
voluminous
investigation.
mr.
goldfine
was
scheduled
to
try
the
case,
and
that
was
scheduled
to
begin
on
september
the
23rd,
1976.
on
september
17th,
six
days
before
trial,
the
friday
before
trial,
the
case
was
reassigned
from
mr.
goldfine
to
bruce
hotchkiss,
an
equally
experienced
senior
trial
deputy
with
the
san
francisco
public
defender.
the
reason
for
the
reassignment
was
that
mr.
goldfine
had
been
hospitalized
with
appendicitis.
mr.
hotchkiss
met
briefly
that
day,
on
friday,
with
mr.
slappy
and
advised
him
of
the
reassignment.
he
met
again
with
him
briefly
on
monday
morning
in
court,
and
then
on
tuesday
spent
in
excess
of
three
hours
with
him
discussing
the
case,
met
with
him
again
wednesday
morning,
again
wednesday
afternoon.
on
thursday,
september
23rd,
in
the
morning,
a
jury
was
selected
and
empaneled.
that
afternoon,
mr.
slappy,
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
complained
to
the
judge
that
in
his
opinion
mr.
hotchkiss
had
not
had
an
adequate
opportunity
to
prepare.
he
believed--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--no,
your
honor,
it
had
not,
but
a
jury
had
been
empaneled,
and
at
that
point
it
may
have
been
necessary
to
declare
a
mistrial
rather
than
simply
a
continuance,
because
jeopardy
had--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--it
does
now,
yes.
the
record
that
was
in
the
certiorari
petition
and
that
came
up
from
the
ninth
circuit
did
not,
but
all
of
those
facts
and
dates
and
times
are
contained
in
the
complete
trial
transcript
which
is
now
before
your
honor.
mr.
stevens
advised
me
this
morning
that
they
had
been
received.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
no,
they
had
not.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
no,
they
had
not.
the
jury
was
empaneled
in
the
morning,
and
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
afternoon
session,
at
which
time
the
prosecutor
would
have
begun
his
opening
statement
and
begun
to
present
evidence,
mr.
slappy
made
this
complaint,
saying--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--that
is
how
the
state
trial
judge
characterized
it.
he
had
characterized
it
as
a
motion
by
slappy
for
a
continuance
in
order
to
allow
mr.
hotchkiss
to
prepare.
mr.
hotchkiss
responded
that
in
fact
he
was
fully
prepared.
he
had
had
six
full
days.
he
had
had
an
opportunity
to
meet
with
mr.
slappy.
he
was
fully
familiar
with
the
record,
including
that
complete
investigation
conducted
by
mr.
goldfine,
and
that
in
his
opinion
a
continuance
to
allow
him
to
prepare
further
was
not
necessary.
that
is
how
the
trial
judge
characterized
it,
and
that
is
how
he
responded
to
it,
as
a
motion
for
continuance
until
mr.
hotchkiss
could
prepare.
at
no
time
during
this
hearing
on
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day
of
trial
was
mr.
goldfine
mentioned
by
mr.
slappy.
he
did
not
ask
to
have
goldfine
represent
him.
he
did
not
identify
goldfine
as
his
attorney.
he
did
not
say
that
he
wanted
goldfine
to
continue
to
represent
him.
the
only
reference
in
the
record
on
that
day
to
mr.
goldfine
is
by
mr.
hotchkiss
who,
as
he
is
explaining
to
the
judge
the
reason
for
the
reassignment
of
the
case,
says
in
passing,
i
was
assigned
the
case
last
friday
because
mr.
goldfine
is
in
the
hospital
with
appendicitis.
on
the
second
day
of
trial,
friday,
the
24th
of
september,
mr.
slappy
interrupted
mr.
hotchkiss's
cross
examination
of
the
victim
several
times,
complaining
about
the
manner
in
which
the
cross
examination
was
being
conducted.
what
he
was
objecting
to
were
leading
questions
by
mr.
hotchkiss
and
attempts
to
limit
the
witness's
testimony.
later,
the
judge
told
mr.
slappy
that
in
fact
that
was
a
standard
technique
of
cross
examination,
and
had
often
been
found
to
be
very
effective.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
this
comes
on
the
second
day.
i
am
just
getting
to
that.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
no,
on
the
first
day
he
only
refers
to
hotchkiss,
and
he
refers
to
him
as
"my
attorney",
referring
to
the
attorney
who
is
in
court
with
him
today,
saying,
i
don't
think
that
this
attorney
has
had
an
opportunity
to
prepare.
he
makes
no
reference
to
any
other
attorney
ever
having
represented
him.
but
now--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--oh,
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
he
refers
to
him
as
p.d.>
["]--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--sometimes
they
describe
them--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--in
even...
well--
0
[generallaughter.]
there
have
been
instances
when,
unfortunately,
they
have
been
described--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--i
think
it's
a
common
shorthand
reference
in
the
courts--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--by
the
district
attorneys--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--and...
the
d.a.
yes,
your
honor.
certainly
it's
a
term
which
when
used
by
a
defendant
will
identify
his
attorney
and
not
the
police
department.
again
in
response
the
judge
had
a...
during
a
recess
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
of
that
second
day
of
trial,
mr.
slappy
repeated
the
complaints
he
had
made
the
day
before,
and
said,
i
don't
think
that
this
attorney
is
prepared,
and
again,
mr.
hotchkiss
fully
outlined
his
preparation,
including
the
fact
that
he
was
going
to
have
three
full
days,
not
just
the
weekend,
but
the
additional
day
of
monday
because
of
prior
judicial
commitments
by
the
court
in
which
to
discuss
the
case
further
with
mr.
slappy,
prepare
him
to
testify
if
necessary,
to
prepare
the
defense.
now,
at
this
time,
mr.
slappy
did
make
reference
to
goldfine.
he
does
refer
to
him
as
p.d.
goldfine>
["]
in
the
course
of
his
conversations,
and
says,
he
was
my
attorney
and
he
still
is,
but
he
says
that
in
the
context
of,
and
i
haven't
seen
him
for
five
weeks.
again,
he
did
not
request
a
substitution.
he
did
not
ask
that
goldfine
represent
him,
and
he
did
not
identify
goldfine
as
his
attorney.
in
fact,
he
said
that
he
had
nothing
against
mr.
hotchkiss,
and
specifically
said
that
he
did
not
think
hotchkiss
was
a
bad
p.d.--
on
the
third
day
of
trial,
which
was
a
tuesday,
september
the
27th,
mr.
slappy
flatly
refused
to
cooperate
any
further
with
mr.
hotchkiss.
he
was
now
declaring
that
his
attorney
was
mr.
goldfine,
that
his
only
attorney
was
mr.
goldfine,
and
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
hotchkiss.
he
asked
on
several
occasions
to
leave
the
courtroom,
but
did
not.
he
stayed
in
court,
and
occasionally
disrupted
the
proceeding
with
outbursts
and
questions
and
statements,
much
as
he
had
done
the
previous
friday.
in
this
trial,
he
was
convicted
of
robbery,
burglary,
and
false
imprisonment,
but
the
jury
deadlocked
on
the
sex
offenses,
and
a
retrial
was
scheduled,
which
began
about
two
weeks
later,
on
october
the
6th,
1976.
this
was
in
front
of
a
different
san
francisco
superior
court
judge,
but
mr.
hotchkiss
continued
to
represent
mr.
slappy.
during
this
proceeding,
mr.
slappy
was
described
by
the
second
trial
judge
as
deliberately
disruptive.
the
judge
noted
that
he
occasionally
slept
through
the
proceedings,
and
that
in
his
opinion,
the
trial
judge's
opinion,
mr.
slappy
was
simply
trying
to
create
a
record.
characteristic
of
his
behavior
was
an
event
which
occurred
as
the
jury
was
being
taken
out
by
the
bailiff
to
begin
their
deliberations.
mr.
slappy
suddenly
stood
up
and
said
in
front
of
the
jury,
"i
want
to
testify".
now,
he
had
been
asked
prior
to
that
by
his
attorney
to
testify,
and
he
had
said,
"no,
i
am
not
going
to.
"
and
had
flatly
refused.
now,
however,
as
the
jury
is
getting
ready
to
begin
deliberations,
he
decided
he
wants
to
testify,
not
unlike
a
tactic
or
a
ploy
he
had
pulled
in
the
first
trial.
there,
the
jury
had
returned
to
have
certain
testimony
reread.
as
they
were
being
led
out
to
continue
their
deliberations,
mr.
slappy
suddenly
jumped
up
and
said
to
this
jury,
"there
are
two
sides
to
every
story,
and
you
haven't
heard
mine.
"
he
had
also
refused
to
testify
in
the
first
trial.
in
the
second
trial,
mr.
slappy
was
convicted
of
rape
and
forcible
oral
copulation.
all
five
of
these
convictions
were
affirmed
by
the
california
court
of
appeal
in
january,
1978,
and
the
state
supreme
court
denied
hearing.
in
december,
1978,
the
federal
district
court
judge
in
the
northern
district
of
california
denied
slappy's
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
finding
that
in
his
opinion
the
complaints
which
were
made
by
slappy
with
respect
to
his
attorneys,
to
his
attorney,
had
been
properly
handled
by
the
state
trial
judge.
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed,
and
in
june
of
1981,
in
an
opinion
filed
by
a
three-judge
panel
of
that
court,
concluded
that
an
essential
element
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
is
the
right
to
a
meaningful
attorney-client
relationship.
it
concluded
that
the
failure
of
the
state
trial
judge
to
inquire
into
how
long
mr.
goldfine
might
be
unavailable
violated
that
right,
and
it
equated
this
failure
to
conduct
the
inquiry
with
a
violation
of
slappy's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
in
our
view,
this
extension,
this
expansion
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
unwarranted
and
unnecessary,
and
we
suggest
that
it
is
based,
at
least
in
part,
upon
a
misreading
of
the
trial
record
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
deliberately
disruptive.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
well,
that's
what
they
said,
but
that's
not
true.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
the
ninth
circuit
modified
in
part
its
opinion
in
response
to
our
petition
for
rehearing
and
hearing
en
banc,
saying
in
that
amendment
that
slappy
in
their
view
was
acting
in
good
faith
when
he
asked
to
have
goldfine,
and
was
not
being
disruptive
or
uncooperative.
that
isn't
true,
in
part
because
at
the
time
of
the
continuance
request
he
wasn't
asking
for
goldfine.
he
was
asking
to
be
assured
that
hotchkiss
was
prepared.
but
moreover,
we
have
always
argued
that
slappy
is
a
manipulative
and
disruptive
defendant
and
that
his
behavior
from
the
beginning
of
the
first
trial
to
the
end
of
the
second
trial
illustrates
that.
particularly
in
the
first
case,
he
consistently
looked
for
one
way
or
another
to
try
to
stop
the
case
or
disrupt
it.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
no,
he
did
not.
he
made
actually
a
great
many
efforts
to
try
to
get
mr.
slappy
to
cooperate
with
the
case,
and
on
several
occasions
when
slappy
said,
"i
want
to
leave
the
courtroom,
let
me
out
of
here.
"
the
judge
said,
well,
i
think
it
is
to
your
advantage,
please
sit
down
and
please
remain,
and
tried
several
times
to
discuss
with
him.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
no.
we
do
not.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
from
the
second
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
it
does.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes.
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
the
sixth--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--yes?
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
precisely.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
precisely.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
no,
i
think
not,
and
i
can
address
that
right
now,
and
i
would
like
to,
because
it
is
important
to
emphasize
here
that
as
the
ninth
circuit
saw
it,
the
sixth
amendment
violation
was
not
simply
that
mr.
hotchkiss
rather
than
mr.
goldfine
represented
slappy,
but
rather
that
the
judge
did
not
conduct
the
inquiry,
which
in
its
view
was
required
by
the
record.
now,
i
think
as
far
as
determining
whether
the
state
trial
judge
was
obligated
to
conduct
that
inquiry,
one
framework
for
analyzing
that
issue
is
to
look
at
the
conflict
of
interest
counsel
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
over
the
last
few
years.
the
first
of
those
cases
was
holloway
versus
arkansas
in
1978,
in
which
it
held
that
where
you
had
three
defendants
represented
by
a
single
public
defender
who
said
that
in
his
view
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest,
that
the
failure
by
the
trial
judge
in
that
case
to
respond
to
that
request
by
the
defense
attorney,
coupled
with
the
requests
by
the
three
individual
defendants
for
separate
counsel,
constituted
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
not
just
because
they
had
a
single
attorney,
but
because
no
response
was
made
to
the
requests
for
separate
counsel.
holloway
was
followed
in
1980
by
cyler
versus
sullivan.
there
you
had
three
defendants,
each
represented
by
the
same
two
retained
attorneys.
at
no
time
during
the
state
proceedings
was
there
ever
any
objection
to
this
joint
representation,
nor
did
it
appear
in
the
record
that
there
ever
was
an
actual
conflict
of
interest.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
unless
the
trial
judge
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest,
he
was
under
no
sui
sponte
duty
to
conduct
an
inquiry
into
the
possibility
of
a
conflict
of
interest.
then,
finally,
in
1981,
in
wood
v.
georgia,
the
court
found
that
where
you
had
defendants,
several
defendants
represented
by
the
same
attorney
who
had
been
hired
by
the
defendants'
employer,
and
who
appeared
to
perhaps
have
a
conflict
of
interest
as
between
the
interests
of
the
defendants
and
the
interests
of
the
employer,
that
on
those
facts,
the
trial
judge
was
reasonably
required
to
conduct
an
inquiry
because
he
reasonably
should
have
known
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
should
have
determined
whether
it
existed,
and
if
so,
whether
that
conflict
was
waived
by
the
defendants.
i
think
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
which
is
really
much
closer
to
cyler
than
it
is
either
to
holloway
or
to
wood
v.
georgia.
the
trial
judge
was
faced
with
a
specific
objection
by
mr.
slappy,
which
was
that
he
did
not
think
hotchkiss
was
prepared.
he
was
not
faced
with
a
request
by
mr.
slappy
or
any
statement
by
mr.
slappy
that
he
wanted
mr.
goldfine
to
represent
him.
the
only
way
that
you
can
support
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion
that
an
inquiry
was
required
on
this
record
is
if
you
agree
with
what
i
think
is
the
underlying
assumption
of
the
ninth
circuit,
which
was
that
when
it
became
apparent
to
the
judge,
or
when
the
judge
became
aware
through
the
statements
of
hotchkiss
that
there
had
been
a
substitution
of
one
deputy
public
defender
for
another
deputy
public
defender,
at
that
moment,
absent
any
objection
from
mr.
slappy,
the
judge
was
required
to
conduct
the
inquiry.
we
submit
that
he
was
not,
unless
he
knew
or
reasonably
should
have
known
that
slappy
was
objecting
to
that
substitution,
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
suggests
that
he
did.
the
judge's
only
obligation,
we
submit,
on
these
facts,
was
to
ensure
that
mr.
hotchkiss
was
prepared
and
was
capable
of
providing
effective
assistance
of
counsel
because
he
had
enough
time
to
read
the
record,
to
meet
with
his
client,
and
to
prepare
a
defense.
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
on
these
facts
really
doesn't
hold...
well,
what
it
really
holds
is
that
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
continuous
representation,
because
it
is
going
to
obligate
a
trial
judge
any
time
he
is
aware
that
there
has
been
a
substitution
of
counsel
to
conduct
that
inquiry
regardless
of
any
objection
by
the
defendant.
now,
that
brings
me
back
to
what
the
sixth
amendment
held...
excuse
me,
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
as
an
extension
of
the
sixth
amendment,
namely,
the
right
to
a
meaningful
attorney-client
relationship.
the
sixth
amendment,
this
court
has
held,
prohibits
a
trial
judge
from
arbitrarily
interfering
with
the
development
of
the
attorney-client
relationship,
from
arbitrarily
or
unnecessarily
interfering
with
the
ability
of
the
defense
attorney
to
represent
his
client
and
meet
with
his
client.
it
does
not,
however,
we
submit,
guarantee
a
meaningful
attorney-client
relationship,
for
that
can
occur
only
through
the
mutual
cooperation
of
the
defendant
and
the
attorney.
if
such
a
relationship
fails
to
develop,
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
there
has
been
judicial
interference
with
the
opportunity
or
ability
of
the
attorney
and
the
defendant
to
develop
that
relationship.
where
all
we
have
is
a
failure
by
a
trial
judge
to
conduct
an
inquiry
into
the
reasons
why
a
public
defender
substituted
one
trial
deputy
for
another
trial
deputy,
that
is
not
the
type
of
interference
which
this
court
has
condemned
and
which
can
be
said
to
have
interfered
with
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
be
represented
effectively
by
counsel
at
trial.
that,
of
course,
is
the
key
to
all
sixth
amendment
cases,
assuring
that
the
defendant
received
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
a
mere
substitution
of
one
trial
deputy
from
a
public
defender's
office
for
another
trial
deputy
in
and
of
itself
is
not
the
kind
of
act
which
is
likely
to
have
an
adverse
impact
upon
the
effective
representation
of
the
defendant
or
to
otherwise
prejudice
the
defendant.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
we
do.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
the
definition
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
as
california
has
recently
formulated
it,
which
was
based
in
part
on
language
in
some
federal
opinions,
is
that
it
must
be
shown,
in
order
to
establish
that
counsel
was
not
effective,
the
defendant
must
show
that
he
failed
to
act
in
a
manner
to
be
expected
of
reasonably
competent
attorneys
acting
as
diligent
advocates,
and
that
that
failure
resulted
in
the
withdrawal
of
a
potentially
meritorious
defense.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
well,
the
federal
courts
have
used
that
standard.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
the
withdrawal
of
a
meritorious
defense?
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
that
may
be--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--i
think
that
is--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--the
ninth
circuit,
i
believe,
does
have
that
standard.
i
think
it
is
contained
in
the
de
coster
cases
in
the
district.
now,
as
far
as
the
defendant
in
this
case
receiving
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
record,
it
is
clear
that
he
was
represented
by
a
senior
trial
deputy
from
the
public
defender's
office,
very
experienced,
who
had
six
full
days
within
which
to
review
the
record.
it
is
clear,
as
you
will
see--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--well,
he
had
six
days--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
what
i--
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
--i
am
not
saying
that
he
necessarily
did
use
all
those
six
days.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
he
had
that
opportunity,
and
i
think
that
the
state
trial
judge
in
this
case
was
required
to
take
mr.
hotchkiss
at
his
word
when
he
said,
i
am
fully
prepared.
i
have
had
what
i
feel
to
be
a
reasonable
enough
opportunity
to
review
the
record,
to
review
the
preliminary
hearing
transcript.
there
has
been
a
complete
investigation,
and
i
am
familiar
with
it.
and
i
think
that
is
expressed
when
you
examine
his
cross
examination
of
the
victim.
it
is
very
complete.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
he
did,
your
honor.
he
did.
he
indicated
that
in
his
view
the
case
was
being
handled
in
a
very
effective
manner.
that
would
be
on
the
second
day
of
the
trial,
he
had
made
reference
to
that,
noting,
for
example,
in
particular,
his
long-term
contacts
and
experience
with
mr.
hotchkiss.
i
think,
your
honors,
because
it
is
clear
from
this
record
that
this
defendant
was
represented
by
an
attorney
who
was
prepared,
who
was
able
to
provide
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
and
who
did
provide
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
that
mr.
slappy
did
receive
a
fundamentally
fair
trial.
the
ninth
circuit
was
incorrect,
and
we
urge
that
it
be
reversed.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time,
if
i
may,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
a
couple
of
points
i
would
like
to
make.
what
we
see
as
one
of
the
critical
difficulties
with
this
ninth
circuit
opinion
was
suggested
by
the
questioning
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
mr.
justice
powell,
and
that
is
that
carried
to
its
logical
extreme,
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
would
permit
an
indigent
defendant
or
any
defendant
to
seek
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
solely
on
the
grounds
that
he
did
not
have
what
he
perceived
to
be
a
meaningful
attorney-client
relationship
with
the
attorney
who
represented
him
at
trial.
what
it
does
is
to
transfer
the
sixth
amendment
determination
of
whether
the
sixth
amendment
has
been
satisfied
from
whether
he
had
an
attorney
to
whether
he
had
an
attorney
that
he
liked.
it
makes
it
a
subjective
test,
and
that
simply
is
not
the
obligation
under
the
sixth
amendment.
he
must
have
an
attorney.
he
must
have
an
attorney
who
was
individually
responsible
to
his
undivided
interests,
and
whose
actions
are
independent
of
the
public
defender
or
the
government
agency
which
funds
that
office.
but
the
mere
fact
that
he
says,
i
didn't
like
him,
or
i
couldn't
get
along
with
him,
standing
alone,
cannot
establish
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
now,
mr.
bassi
has
suggested
that
what
mr.
slappy
was
trying
to
do
here
was
simply
say
in
the
best
way
he
could
what
he
really
wanted,
which
was
to
have
goldfine.
if
what
he
wanted
was
to
have
mr.
goldfine
represent
him,
it
took
no
sophistication,
no
great
feat
of
art
for
him
to
say,
i
want
mr.
goldfine.
even
when
on
that
first
day
of
trial,
when
mr.
hotchkiss
told
the
judge,
i
was
reassigned
to
the
case
because
mr.
goldfine
is
in
the
hospital,
slappy
said
nothing.
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
dane
r.
gillette
that's
correct.
our
position
is
that,
first,
that
the
judge
had
no
duty
to
inquire
on
this
record,
but
that
even
if
there
had
been
a
request,
or
you
can
infer
a
request,
the
judge's
only
obligation
was
to
ensure
that
the
public
defender
who
was
assigned
and
who
was
present
at
trial
had
the
opportunity
to
prepare,
had
access
to
the
record,
had
an
opportunity
to
meet
with
his
client,
and
was
ready
to
proceed.
mr.
hotchkiss
had
an
obligation
when
asked
by
the
trial
judge
if
he
was
ready
to
proceed
to
say,
yes,
he
was,
if
in
fact
he
was
ready.
he
had
an
obligation
as
an
officer
of
the
court
not
to
mislead
the
judge.
the
final
point
i
want
to
make
here
is
that
what
really
happened,
what
is
really
happening
in
this
case
is
that
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
has
once
again,
unfortunately,
confused
its
power
to
have
supervisory
control
over
the
federal
trial
courts
with
its
responsibility
in
cases
of
habeas
corpus
not
to
set
aside
state
convictions
unless
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation.
if
the
ninth
circuit
wants
to
say
that
defendants
who
are
represented
by...
who
are
being
tried
in
federal
district
court
and
are
being
represented
by
federal
public
defenders
have
these
kinds
of
rights,
that
is
fine.
they
can
do
that.
they
have
that
supervisory
power.
we
see
nothing
in
the
sixth
amendment
which
compels
it
as
an
aspect
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
because
of
that,
we
submit
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
was
incorrect,
and
again,
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
it.
