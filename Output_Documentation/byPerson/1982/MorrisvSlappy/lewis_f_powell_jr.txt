mr.
bassi,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
how
would
you
define
a
meaningful
relationship
between
a
lawyer
and
his
client?
i
have
heard
it
used
in
other
connections,
but
i
never
heard
it
used
before
with
respect
to
client--

justice

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
if
you
had
the
leading
defense
counsel
at
the
san
francisco
bar
appointed
to
represent
a
defendant,
and
he
had
done
all
of
the
investigating
that
any
lawyer
would
have
done,
but
on
the
first
day
of
trial
the
defendant
said,
judge,
i
just
don't
trust
this
fellow,
and
i
don't
have
a
meaningful
relation
with
him?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
even
in
those
circumstances
there
would
be
any
right
to
have
the
second
leading
lawyer
in
san
francisco
represent
him?
