justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
was
the
date
of
that
arraignment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
papers
before
us
don't
have
anything
about
the
date
of
the
arraignment,
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
date
of
mr.
goldfine's
hospitalization,
all
of
which,
it
seems
to
me,
are
somewhat
pertinent.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
that
point,
had
any
evidence
come
in?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
again,
the
record
before
us
doesn't
show
that,
does
it?
