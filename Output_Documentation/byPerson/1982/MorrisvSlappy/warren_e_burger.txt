chief

e.

we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
morris
against
slappy.
mr.
gillette,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
avoid
an
interruption
later
on,
i
could
not
put
my
finger
on
the
date
of
the
criminal
act
that
was
charged
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
challenge
here
to
the
verdict
as
such?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
that
no
evidence
had
gone
in
at
the
time
he
made
this
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
opening
statements
had
been
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
notice,
counsel,
and
it
may
not
be
terribly
important,
but
in
the
appendix
here,
the
conversations
reflecting
what
mr.
slappy
said,
the
public
defender
is
simply
indicated
by
p.d.>
["]
now,
did
he,
slappy,
in
the
courtroom
call
the
public
defender
p.d.>
["],
or
is
that
the
reporter's
shorthand?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
did
he
use
the
abbreviation
p.d.>
["]?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
way
people
describe
the
public
defender
in
california?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
p.d.?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at,
is
this
the
vernacular
of
the
street,
as
it
were,
or
is
this
a
common--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--in
the
courtrooms.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
d.a.--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
pattern
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
slappy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
his
references
to
the
p.d.--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
trial
judge
at
any
point
in
the
trial
express
any
appraisal
of
the
performance
of
the
p.d.?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
bassi?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bassi,
you
are
here
by
our
appointment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
did
not
check
in
the
record
to
see,
did
you
argue
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
were
there
by
appointment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
was
your
first
contact
with
the
case,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
trial
judge
didn't
have
any
difficulty
in
making
that
evaluation,
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
said
it
several
times,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
you
think...
you
are
suggesting
the
judge
perhaps
was
just
protecting
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
suggest
that
here
there
was
a
last
minute
appointment,
or
that
there
was
a
lack
of
opportunity
to
investigate
and
prepare,
on
this
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
link
that
just
to
this
meaningful
relationship
concept.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
to
the
effective
assistance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--this
man's
conduct
during
the
trial,
and
the
judge's
observation
about
it,
would
it
be
irrational
for
someone
looking
at
the
record,
not
having
been
there,
to
conclude
that
this
man,
slappy,
was
deliberately
trying
to
make
a
record
of
no
meaningful
relationship
with
his
counsel?
would
it
be
irrational
to
reach
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
was
interrupting
the
proceedings
constantly,
wasn't
he,
and
the
judge
reprimanded
him,
what,
two
or
three
or
four
times?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
was
rational
conduct
on
his
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
or
to
ask
for
an
opportunity
to
make
these
points
to
the
judge
in
chambers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
only
because
the
court
required
him
to
come
to
chambers
after
his
outburst.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
innocent
or
indigent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
indigent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bassi,
if
you
were
to
prevail
here,
then
the
consequence
would
be,
the
case
would
go
back
for
a
third
trial?
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
the
crime
took
place
in
1975
or
six?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
seventy-six.
and
so
this
woman
who
was
the
complaining
witness
would
have
to
appear
again
if
the
case
were
to
be
tried.
and
that
would
be
six,
given
the
month
that
we
are
in,
it
might
be
seven
years
after
the
crime
and
the
first
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
gillette?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i

and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
morris
against
slappy
and
for

the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed.
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
with
directions
to
reinstate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
marshall
has
joined.
and
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
the
