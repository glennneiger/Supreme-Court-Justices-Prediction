justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
chief
justice
referred
to
it
in
terms
of
a
motion.
would
you
describe
it
as
a
motion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
the
second
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
comment
was
just
addressed
only
to
the
first
trial?
correct.
the
first
judge
never
made
any
specific
comments
on
the
record
that
in
his
opinion
slappy
was
being
disruptive
or
manipulative,
but
rather
went
out
of
his
way
to
try
to
get
him
to--
--this
pattern
appears
in
both
trials.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bassi--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
made
a
comment
a
moment
ago
that
goldfine,
the
original
attorney,
i
believe,
had
done
voluminous
research.
i
didn't
catch
that
in
the
record.
is
it
somewhere
in
the
record?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
personally
done...
does
the
record
indicate
that
was
personally
done
by
mr.
goldfine?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
the
custom
of
the
public
defender's
office
in
san
francisco,
do
you
know,
to
have
most
of
the
legwork
in
investigations
done
by
actual
lawyers,
or
just
by
investigators?
or
is
there--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
now,
the
powell
case
involved
appointment
of
the
entire
bar
of
the
county,
and
that
has
never
been
done
since,
has
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
a
court
finds
that
a
client
was
afforded
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
could
he
nonetheless
seek
habeas
relief
on
the
grounds
that
although
his
assistance
was
effective,
he
didn't
have
a
meaningful
relationship
with
his
attorney?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
were
back
in
the
ninth
circuit
arguing
this
case
on
appeal,
as
i
understand
you
did,
and
you
concluded
the
part
of
your
argument
devoted
to
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
let's
assume
you
made
one.
and
the
three
judges
there
say,
well,
we
think
this
man
received
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
now,
what
else
have
you
got
to
say?
and
then
you
go
on
and
say,
well,
i
want
to
point
out
that
even
if
you
think
he
got
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
i
want
to
raise
the
point
that
he
didn't
have
a
meaningful
relationship
with
his
counsel.
now,
do
you
think
that
is
a
separate
point
that
the
ninth
circuit
or
any
other
court
should
consider
after
finding
that
he
had
effective
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
burton
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
case
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
always
a
legitimate
interest
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
in
going
to
trial
if
the
case
has
been
set,
the
prosecutor
is
ready,
the
witnesses
are
ready?
the
burden
is
always
on
the
person
who
wants
to
postpone
the
trial
in
that
situation,
whether
it
is
a
defendant
or
a
prosecutor,
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
he
made
a
determination
in
denying.
he
said,
i
hear
your
motion
for
a
continuance.
i
am
going
to
deny
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
your
constitutional
point,
what
it
finally
boils
down
to?
not
a
point
that
the
california
court
of
appeals
could
reverse
on
error,
but
that
a
federal
court
could
set
aside
a
state
conviction
because
a
state
trial
judge
confronted
by
a
pro
se
motion
for
a
continuance
doesn't
go
through
the
precise
formulations
that
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
him
go
through?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
set
forth
in
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
cyler,
yes.
he
played
center
field
for
the
chicago
cubs
in
1933.
right
field.
right
field?
okay.
