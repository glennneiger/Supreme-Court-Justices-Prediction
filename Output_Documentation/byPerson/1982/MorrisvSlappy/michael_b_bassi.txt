mr.
michael
b.
bassi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
or
not
mr.
slappy
received
a
fair
trial.
the
issue
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court
impacting
upon
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
the
federal
district
court
does
as
it
impacts
upon
the
right
to
counsel.
the
right
to
counsel
is
fundamental
and
essential
to
a
fair
trial.
there
seems
to
be
two
strains
in
the
federal
cases
which
indicate
that,
and
i
would
cite
avery,
for
example,
as
one
strain,
indicating
that
the
courts
have
recognized
that
a
request
for
a
continuance
would
necessarily
have
some
impact
upon
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
there
are
other
cases,
and
i
would
cite
burton
and
candy,
that
recognize
that
the
impact
of
a
request
for
a
continuance
affects
the
right
to
counsel.
burton
and
gandy
never
reached
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
court
would
have
to
reverse
on
the
issue
of
right
to
counsel;
rather,
decided
the
case
on
fair
trial.
the
more
recent
cases
of
laura,
which
is
out
of
the
third
circuit,
and
linton
v.
perini,
out
of
the
sixth
circuit,
definitely
discuss
the
issue
of
a
continuance
and
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court
definitely
impacting
upon
the
right
to
counsel
rather
than
on
the
fair
trial
side
of
the
train
of
thought
in
the
federal
cases.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
the
issue
is
not
effective
assistance
of
counsel
as
we
see
it,
and
the
court
does
not
have
to
reach
that
issue
by
a
narrow
ruling
in
this
case.
the
trial
court,
as
the
record
reflects,
was
concerned
with
moving
its
calendar
and
providing...
moving
slappy
towards
a
trial.
the
court
was
aware,
though,
that
slappy's
requests
for
a
continuance
were
a
request
for
representation
by
a
specific
public
defender.
when
slappy
filed
his
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
third
day
of
trial,
indicating
that
his
attorney
was
in
the
hospital,
the
court
specifically
stated
to
him,
we
have
been
through
this
already,
mr.
slappy,
on
monday.
there
is
nothing
new
added.
and
i
would
refer
this
court
to
the
joint
appendix,
on
page
30.
the
california
court
of
appeal,
in
deciding
the
appeal
by
the...
excuse
me,
the
respondent,
indicated
on...
in
its
opinion
at
page
c-3
of
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
appellant's
real
object
at
trial
apparently
was
that
he
preferred
to
be
assisted
by
another
deputy
public
defender
who
had
originally
been
assigned
to
the
case
but
had
been
relieved
in
order
to
have
surgery
for
appendicitis.
appellant
told
the
court,
"i
am
happy
with
the
public
defender,
but
it
is
just
no
way,
no
possible
way
that
he
has
had
enough
time
to
prepare
this
case.
"
that
language
is
reflected
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
12.
the
trial
court--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--the--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--no,
he
didn't,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
as
to
the
choice
of
initial
appointment,
no,
the
client
doesn't
have
a
right.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
after
there
is
an
attorney-client
relationship
established,
we
would
submit
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
maintain
that
relationship
if--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--well,
then,
this
is
why
the
trial
court
is
the
final
arbiter
in
the
exercise
of
proper
discretion.
if
the
attorney
dies,
the
trial
court
can
naturally
substitute
another
defender.
if
the
defender
leaves
the
office,
the
trial
court
can
naturally
substitute
another
public
defender.
but
the
trial
court
cannot
over
the
objections
of
the
defendant
arbitrarily
impose
another
attorney
on
the
defendant,
which
it
did
in
this
case.
the
trial
court
made
no
balancing
in
the
exercise
of
discretion.
it
should
have
inquired
at
least
into
the
nature
and
extent
of
goldfine's
interests
as
to...
it
should
have
inquired
as
to
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
relationship
between
goldfine
and
slappy,
because
slappy
vehemently
objected
throughout
the
trial
as
to
the
imposition
of
hotchkiss.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
he
did
not
specifically
state,
i
want
harvey
goldfine.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
he
did
not
specifically
state
harvey
goldfine.
no,
he
didn't,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
he
said--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--correct.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
correct.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
no,
that's--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--the
trial
judge--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--on
the
issue
of
who
should
have
been
his
counsel,
the
hearing
should
have
been
made
prior
to
the
trial
beginning
at
the
time
that
slappy
made
his
objection
as
to
who
his
counsel
was,
and
that
was--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
objection--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--he
doesn't
say
that
until
the
second
day
of
trial.
but
the
record
reflects
that
slappy
felt
that
hotchkiss
was
not
prepared.
hotchkiss
admits
on
the
second
day
of
trial
that
he
hadn't
prepared
slappy
for
direct
or
cross
examination.
slappy
indicates
that
he
hadn't
viewed
the
scene.
the
trial
judge
on
the
third
day,
when
slappy
specifically
requests
goldfine,
states
that
this
matter
has
been
already
reviewed
on
the
first
day
and
nothing
new
has
been
added.
i
think
the
record
fairly
reflects
slappy
at
least
thought
the
only
attorney
that
could
represent
him
at
that
late
date
was
the
attorney
who
was
suddenly
replaced
by...
removed
because
of
illness.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes,
i
did.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes,
i
was.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
he
stated
on
the
second
day
of
trial,
p.d.,
mr.
goldfine>
["],
or
p.d.
goldfine>
["].
he
does
specifically
refer
to
mr.
goldfine
on
the
second
day
of
trial.
on
the
third
day
of
trial,
he
states,
"my
attorney
is
in
the
hospital.
"
but
on
the
second
day
of
trial,
he
only
mentions
the
attorney
by
name
at
that
point.
but
that
issue
is
not...
does
not
create
a
waiver
problem
for
us,
because
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
as
fact,
that
the
right
to
counsel
had
been
violated.
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
is
bound
by
comity
to
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
judge
when
ruling
on
an
issue
of
law
in
this
case.
as
the
ninth
circuit
properly
found,
the
right
to
counsel,
the
meaningful
attorney-client
relationship
established
between
goldfine
and
slappy,
was
violated.
therefore,
whether
or
not
slappy's
version
of
the
events
were
correct
or
hotchkiss's
version
in
stating
that
he
was
actually
prepared,
the
court
never
had
to
reach
those
issues,
and
they
never
found
whether
slappy
was
correct
or
whether
or
not
slappy
had
properly
raised
the
issue
on
the
first
day
of
trial
or
not.
they
found
the
court's
failure
to
properly
exercise
discretion.
even
in
the
ruling
on
a
continuance,
the
court
made
no
contrary
findings
as
to
the
government's
need
to
go
to
trial,
and
i
submit
slappy
had
a
second
trial
almost
within
a
month,
so
the
trial
calendar
couldn't
have
been
that
crowded.
they
made
no
findings
as
to...
the
court
made
no
balancing
at
all,
and
in
that
event
it
violated
the
right
to
counsel
by
not
weighing
his
attorney-client
relationship
with
his
previous
lawyer.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
the
same
attorney
that
represented
him
in
the
first
trial,
mr.
hotchkiss,
and
in
fact--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--it
is
difficult
to
tell
from
the
record
whether
or
not
there
was
effective
representation,
partially
because
slappy
didn't
testify.
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
jury
was
hung
on
two
counts
could
be
taken
either
way.
had
he
been
represented
by
goldfine,
who
did
the
voluminous
investigation,
whom
slappy
trusted--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--on...
yes,
on
the
second
case.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
i
am
referring
to
the
first
case.
he
could
have
been
acquitted
on
the
first
case.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
the
second
case,
it
is...
he
refused
to
testify
again,
and
you
really
can't
tell
from
the
record.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
no,
i
am
not
submitting--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--i
am
sorry,
i--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--is
the--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--the--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--i
submit
you
can't
tell
from
the
record,
your
honor,
because
slappy
refuses
to
testify,
because
his
right
to
counsel
was
violated
in
the
first
trial.
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
indicated
that
it
would
be
irrelevant
as
to
effectiveness.
i
don't
think
the
court
can
tell...
i
can't
tell
from
the
record
whether
he
was
effective
or
not.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
the
trial
judge
indicated
in
the
first
trial
that
there
was
an
effective
representation
by
mr.
hotchkiss,
but--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--he
did.
but
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
could
be
looked
upon
as
self-serving
by
the
trial
judge,
because
he
insisted
that
mr.
slappy
go
to
trial
with
mr.
hotchkiss.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
i
think
that
could
be
inferred
from
those
statements,
your
honor.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
is
an
intentional
statement
by
the
trial
judge,
but
there
was
heated
dispute
in
this
trial
who
was
mr.
slappy's
lawyer,
the
conduct
of
the
trial
by
mr.
hotchkiss,
and
i
do
submit
that
slappy
was
not
acting
in
bad
faith.
the
record
reflects
that
generally
his
comments
were
reflected...
reflected
towards
the
identity
of
his
counsel.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes,
justice?
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
the
statements
by
mr.
hotchkiss,
actually
by,
i
think
it's
the
district
attorney,
mr.
dondero,
on
the
first
day
indicate
that
there
was
voluminous
investigation
done,
that
the
investigators
from
the
public
defender's
office
had
been
down
to
the
scene
three
and
four
times,
speaking
to
witnesses.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
actually,
mr.
hotchkiss
does
indicate
that
the
investigation
was...
i'm
sorry.
the
judge
indicates
that
to
mr.
slappy
in
discussing
the
request
for
a
continuance,
that
voluminous
investigation
had
been
done.
apparently,
there
had
been
a
colloquy
prior
to
the
motion
for
a
continuance
on
the
record
between
the
public
defender,
the
district
attorney,
and
the
trial
judge,
which
is
not
reflected
in
the
record,
but
is
indicated
from
the
judge's
comments,
that
he
was
assured
by
the
public
defender
and
by
the
district
attorney
that
hotchkiss
was
ready
to
try
the
case.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
i
think
the...
they
have
an
investigative
staff
in
the
san
francisco
public
defender's
office.
the
general...
the
staff
is
understaffed,
actually,
and
i
think
if
the
work
can
be
done
by
an
investigator,
it
is,
but
i
think
generally
the
lawyer
goes
out
and
takes
a
look
at
the
scene,
and
will
try
and
talk
to
witnesses
if
he
can.
i
don't
think
that
is
the
rule
generally,
but
i
think
most
conscientious
public
defenders
do
do
that,
particularly
if
the
case
is
going
to
trial.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stevens,
does
the
attorney-client...
does
the
sixth
amendment
contain
a
meaningful...
a
right
to
a
meaningful
attorney-client
relationship,
we
submit
that
it
does.
the
interests
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
providing
assistance
to
the
defendant
to
meet
the
intricacies
of
the
law
and
in
meeting
the
advocacy
of
the
public
prosecutor
mandate
that
there
must
be
some
nexus
between
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
and
the
providing
of
an
attorney.
powell
v.
alabama
recognized
that
there
must
be
more
than
just
an
attorney
provided
at
the
last
minute.
there
must
be
investigation--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--no,
it
hasn't,
your
honor.
but
part
of
the
reasoning
behind
powell
in
my
understanding
is
that
the
last
minute
appointment
prevented
any
investigation,
communication,
or
interaction
between
the
defendants
and
the
attorneys
appointed
to
represent
them.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
i
submit
that
there
was
a
last
minute
appointment
resulting
in
the
failure
of
any
attorney-client
relationship
being
established.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
no,
we
are
not
arguing
effective
assistance,
because
we
don't
feel
that
the
record
is...
first
of
all,
that
the
court
has
to
reach
this
issue.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
if
the
trial
judge
were
to
make
an
adequate
inquiry,
and
in
finding
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
that
there
would
be
some
prejudice
to
the
relationship
between
the
client
and
the
attorney,
but
on
the
other
side
found
a
legitimate
need
to
move
the
case
towards
trial
and
did
so,
then
i
suggest
that
prejudice
to
the
defendant
does
not
override
an
adequate
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trial
judge.
what
is
essential,
though,
is
that
there
be
an
adequate,
an
adequate
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes.
the
cases
indicate,
and
i
cite
burton,
for
example,
that
the
courts
have
considered
both
the
right
to
counsel
and
effective
assistance
of
counsel
as
two
separate
issues,
and
that
while
interrelated,
they
necessarily
are
separate
in
the
analysis
of
whether
or
not
effective
assistance
has
been
provided.
in
response
to
your
question,
would
the
habeas
corpus
apply
to
effective
assistance,
yes,
it
would,
but
under
the
full
and
fair
trial
doctrine,
i
submit
that
the
right
to
counsel
should
be
analyzed
under
the
theories
of
gandy
and
burton,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
there
has
been
the
establishment
or
provision
of
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
burton
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
it
is
a
case
from
the
d.c.
court.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
if
the
judge
held...
yes,
it
would,
if
the
judge
completely
exercised
discretion.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
submit
that--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--it's
enough
as
to
whether
or
not
there
has
been
investigation,
but
as
to
a
complete
exercise
of
discretion,
the
court
has
to
consider
other
factors.
in
this
case,
the
court
considered
only
whether
or
not
mr.
hotchkiss
was
going
to
represent
mr.
goldfine.
it
considered...
it
didn't
consider
at
all
whether
or
not...
i'm
sorry...
mr.
hotchkiss
was
going
to
represent
mr.
slappy.
it
considered...
it
did
not
consider
the
nature
and
extent
of
goldfine's
illness.
it
didn't
consider
whether
or
not--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--well,
his
illness,
i
think,
is
critical
in
this
case,
because
it
is
apparent--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--hopefully,
it
wasn't
that
critical.
he--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--yes,
justice.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
i
think
the
american
bar
association
standards
for
criminal
justice
put
it
well,
and
that
is--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--trust
and
confidence.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
they
don't
use
the
words
"a
meaningful
relationship",
but
they
do
utilize
the
words
"trust
and
confidence
are
essential
to
the
lawyer-client
relationship.
"
and--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--i
think
that
is
one
aspect
in
the
exercise
of
discretion
that
the
court
must
look
to.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
if
the
court
properly
exercised
discretion
and
found
no
legitimate...
and
found
there
was
a
legitimate
interest
in
going
to
trial
for
the
prosecution,
then
the
court
is
fully
within
its
discretion
to
order
the
defendant
to
continue
to
trial
with
the
first
attorney
or
by
himself.
the
key
here
is
not
that
the
defendant
conclusively
binds
the
trial
judge,
but
that
the
trial
judge
exercise
his
discretion
by
fully
looking
at
the
issue.
i
submit--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--there
is
always
a
legitimate
interest
the
prosecutor
can
set
forth
in
going
to
trial,
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
submit
that
the
trial
judge
is
best
positioned
to
make
the
final
determination
who
shall
prevail.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
the
trial
judge
did
not
make
a
complete
inquiry
into
the
matter,
though,
and
that
is
the--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--when
it
impacts
upon
the
right
to
counsel,
the
federal
habeas
reviewing
court
may
review
a
state
court's
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
counsel
has
been
provided.
i
think
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
as
set
forth
in
cyler,
and
i
think
justice
frankfort--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--in
cyler
v.
sullivan.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
well,
i
submit
that
it
wouldn't
be
irrational,
but
i
am
not
conceding
the
point
that
that
was
his
purpose.
the--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--that
is
in
the
record,
your
honor.
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
i
think
in
light
of
wainwright,
rose,
and
angle,
that
that
is
the
type
of
conduct
that
is
necessary
for
a
defendant
to
assert
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
i
think
that
he
did
make
some
of
the
points
in
chambers.
possibly
he
felt--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--the
court
asked
him
not
to
make
outbursts
on
the
record,
but
i
submit
that
these
were
outbursts
by
an
uneducated,
indigent
man
trying
to
assert
his
rights
in
the
best
way
possible.
i
think
the
record
doesn't
reflect--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--indigent.
indigent.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
i
would
submit
possibly
he
was
innocent
if
the
effectiveness
of
counsel
isn't
demonstrated
on
the
record.
the
right
to
counsel
is
so
important
that
i
think
it
is
necessary
that
the
defendant
make
the
objection,
and
make
it
in
the
best
way
he
can.
he
tried
on
the
first
day
of
trial,
and
succeeded
on
the
second
and
third.
it
is
clear
that
in
the...
in
the
original
motion
for
the
continuance
and
request
for
specific
counsel,
that
his
attorney
completely
ignored
his
request,
asserting
that
he
was
ready
to
go
to
trial,
and
at
that
point
the
indigent
was
effectively
pro
se
and
without
counsel.
the
important
point
that
we
would
like
to
stress
in
this
case
is
that
the
defendant's
objection
does
not
conclusively
bind
the
trial
court,
that
if
the
trial
court
properly
exercises
discretion,
even
if
it
is
prejudicial
to
the
defendant
to
remove
counsel
or
to
go
to
trial
or
have
the
defendant
go
to
trial
pro
se,
the
trial
court
can
properly
make
that
determination,
but
only
after
it
fully
exercises
discretion.
the
case
which
mr.
gillette
cited,
holloway,
we
feel
is
the
most
similar
to
this
case,
not
whether
the
defendant
had
a
fair
trial,
but
whether
the
trial
court's
exercise
of
discretion
or
failure
to
do
so
impacted
on
his
right
to
counsel.
we
submit
that
the
issue
between
effectiveness
of
counsel
and
identity
of
counsel
is
often
difficult
to
draw,
but
slappy's
objections
in
this
case
go
more
to
the
identity
of
his
counsel
rather
than
the
sufficiency
of
counsel's
preparation
and
the
effectiveness
of
hotchkiss
at
the
trial.
per
se
reversal
is
the
appropriate
standard
when
the
right
to
counsel
is
interfered
with.
the
interests
of
providing
per
se
reversal,
and
i
think
it
is
demonstrated
by
the
conflicting
opinions
in
the
circuits,
are
that
you
can
have
an
evenhanded
application
of
the
rule
for
right
to
counsel.
if
the
case
is
analyzed
in
terms
of
effective
assistance
of
counsel
or
an
abuse
of
discretion
resulting
in
the
denial
of
a
fair
trial,
you
find
conflicting
opinions,
for
example,
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
itself.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
well,
all
five
counts
would
be
retried
again.
i
guess
you
could
call
that
a
third
trial.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
seventy-six.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
she
would,
but
she
doesn't
seem
to
be
adverse
to
appearing,
because
she
has
filed
a
civil
suit
against
the
landlords,
and
that
is
cited
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
chief,
which
was
recently
decided
by
the
california
court
of
appeals.
so
her
civil
lawsuit
is
going
on
in
this
case
at
this
time.
the
position
i
advocate
gives
the
defendant
a
strong
basis
with
which
to
confront
the
advocacy
of
the
prosecutor.
a
meaningful
attorney-client
relationship
between
client
and
attorney
is
essential
to
providing
the
right
to
counsel.
absent
a
meaningful
attorney-client
relationship,
the
trust
and
confidence
necessary
for
the
defendant
to
convey
essential
facts
to
his
attorney
and
for
his
attorney
to
give
him
competent
advice
which
the
defendant
can
rely
on
are
absent.
the
attorney
effectively
works
in
a
vacuum,
and
particularly
in
the
criminal
justice
area,
where
plea
bargaining--
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
--yes,
sir?
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
that,
your
honor,
i
can't
speculate
on,
and
i
think
that
is
the
type
of
speculation
which
this
court
refuses
to
engage
in
when
the
fundamental
right
to
counsel
is
violated.
mr.
michael
b.
bassi
the
position
allows
the
trial
court
to
preserve
the
traditional
relationship
between
attorney
and
client
when
warranted,
and
to
exercise
discretion
in
achieving
the
legitimate
interests
of
society
when
warranted.
we
do
submit
that
the
failure
to
adequately
exercise
discretion
violated
the
right
to
counsel,
and
that
this
court
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
effectiveness
of
assistance
of
counsel.
thank
you.
