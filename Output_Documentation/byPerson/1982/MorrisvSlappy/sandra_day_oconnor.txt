justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--may
i
ask
before
you
go
on,
under
your
version,
i
suppose
we
could
conclude
that
the
trial
judge
was
correct
in
the
first
instance
in
treating
the
comments
of
the
defendant
as,
at
best,
a
motion
for
a
continuance--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--because
no
reference
was
made
at
all
to
his
first
assigned
attorney.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
we
did
that,
we
would
never
reach
this
sixth
amendment
question,
would
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bassi,
it
was
really
the
third
day,
not
the
second
day,
that
the
defendant
first
mentioned
his
original
attorney,
isn't
it?
wasn't
it
the
third
day
of
trial
before
that
occurred?
