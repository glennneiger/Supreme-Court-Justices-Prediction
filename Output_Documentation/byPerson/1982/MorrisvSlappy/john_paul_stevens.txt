justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
gillette,
may
i
ask
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
second
trial,
after
the
mistrial
on
the
two
offenses,
the
judge
there
said
he
thought
that
the
respondent
was
uncooperative
and
deliberately
misbehaving.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
also
in
the
ninth
circuit,
after
they
issued
their
first
opinion,
they
wrote
a
second
opinion
in
which
they
said
at
the
time
of
the
continuance,
which
i
guess
was
before
the
first
trial,
they
thought
he
was
acting
with
sincerity
and
the
state
didn't
disagree
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you.
what
is
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
your
position
is,
he
was
uncooperative
all
the
way
through.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
first
trial
judge?
did
he
say
anything
on
that
precise
point,
whether
he
thought
he
was
sincere
or
just
disruptive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
just
as
one
other
question,
is
that
even
assuming
he
was
sincere
all
the
way
through,
you
don't
think
there
is
this
constitutional
right
to
a
meaningful
relationship
with
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't.
mr.
gillette,
isn't
it
fair
to
infer
at
least
from
some
of
the
trial
judge's
comments
at
the
very
end
of
the
trial
that
he
did
think
mr.
slappy
was
just
making
a
record
for
an
appeal?
look
at,
if
you
will,
joint
appendix
52,
which
i
take
it
is
a
partial
transcript.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gillette,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
take
the
position
here
that
the
defendant
was
effectively
represented
by
counsel
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
what
is
the
correct
statement
of
the
standard
for
determining
whether
there
was
effective
representation
of
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
consider
that
an
acceptable
statement
of
the
federal
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
stop
you
right
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
a
federal
district
court
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
have
the
right
to
set
aside
a
conviction
because
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
state
trial
judge,
if
there
was
not
an
unfair
trial?
