justice
thurgood
marshall
wait
a
minute.
what
in
the
record
says
that
he
had
six
full
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
telling
me
that
a
public
defender
in
california
only
works
on
one
case
at
a
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
you
don't
try
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
know
and
i
know
that
they
handle
five...
i'm
not
saying
they
don't
do
it
properly,
but
they
handle
several
cases
at
the
same
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
full-time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
at
any
time
explain
why
it
wasn't
effective
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
an
indigent
does
not
have
a
right
to
a
particular
public
defender?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
is,
at
one
time
when
i
was
handling
the
assignment
of
pro
forma
cases
on
the
second
circuit,
one
of
the
prisoners
insisted
that
he
be
represented
by
edward
bennet
williams,
but
he
didn't
have
that
right,
did
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
does
your
client
have
a
right
to
any
particular
public
defender?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
initial.
i
said
the
right
to
a
particular
public
defender
at
any
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
he
resigns.
or
died.
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
read
the
joint
appendix,
he
didn't
mention
the
other
lawyer
until
the
second
day.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
want
the
word
"specific".
did
he
mention
it
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
say
that
he
had
a
prior
public
defender?
he
didn't
say
a
word
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
he
said
was,
this
man
didn't
get
in
until
tuesday
night.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all
he
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
now
the
trial
is
proceeding,
and
at
that
stage
he
comes
in
and
tells
the
judge,
you
know,
there
was
another
public
defender.
he
is
supposed
to
stop
the
trial
and
go
into
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
should
he
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
should
he
have
had
the
hearing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
slappy
did
not
make
an
objection
to
mr....
he
objected
to
the
counsel
he
had
at
that
time.
i
read
this
record.
he
said
he
didn't
have
time
to
prepare
the
case,
that
he
came
in
tuesday,
and
i
didn't
see
him
again
until
this
morning.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
will
you
point
me
where
in
the
record
he
says
that
i
object
to
this
man
representing
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
represented
him
in
the
second
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
say
he
wasn't
properly
represented
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
second
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
second
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
talking
about
the
second
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
isn't...
when
a
man
refuses
to
testify,
that
says
that
he
is
not
represented
by
counsel?
i
am
talking
about
the
counsel
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
raised
it...
is
the
counsel
point
in
the
second
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
so,
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
inadequacy
of
counsel
in
the
second
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
so,
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
bassi,
suppose
the
judge
holds
a
hearing
and
finds
that
there
has
been
a
thorough
investigation
made,
and
all
that
is
in
a
voluminous
file
in
the
public
defender's
office,
and
that
no
more
investigation
is
needed.
would
that
be
satisfactory?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
let
me
read
to
you.
"mr.
goldfine
did
voluminous
investigation
in
the
case.
"
"my
feeling
is
that
all
the
investigation
that
needed
to
be
done
and
that
should
be
done
and
quite
possibly
that
could
be
done
had
been
done.
"
that
was
testimony
before
the
judge.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
you
say
that
was
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
his
illness
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
critical
to
him.

justice
thurgood

when
you
read--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--when
you
read
his
testimony,
couldn't
you
get
the
feeling
that
if
goldfine
had
tried
this
case
and
hotchkiss
had
been
in
the
hospital,
he
would
have
made
the
same
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
try
my
best.
