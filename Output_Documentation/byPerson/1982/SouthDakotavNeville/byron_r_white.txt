justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
evidence
is
inadmissible
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
case
goes
back
on
that
basis
and
there
is
an
acquittal,
you
are
through.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
said
there
wasn't
a
final
judgment
and
didn't
review
the
case,
then
the
evidence
is
inadmissible
and
you
could
never
get
review
if
there
is
an
acquittal.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we
have
jurisdiction
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
lack
of
finality?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
because
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
not
finality,
is
it?
is
it
an
independent
state
ground
of
some
kind?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
we
dismissed
this
case
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
the
case
went
back,
the
evidence
would
be
inadmissible,
but
not
only
for
the
constitutional
reason
but
for
irrelevancy
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
even
if
we
reversed,
even
if
we
reversed
the
constitutional
ruling,
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
wouldn't
be
admissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
other
two
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
these
other
two
grounds
ever
get
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota
for
exclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
case
is
tried
as
an
acquittal,
the
state
cannot
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
a
question
of
finality;
it
is
a
question
of
an
independent
state
ground,
really.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
final
enough,
but
it
makes
the
ruling
irrelevant
in
this
case.
however
you
decide
this
ground
will
make
no
difference
in
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
quite
important,
as
justice
stevens
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
is
in
the
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
case
resolves
itself
down
to
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
abused
his
discretion
under
the
state
statute,
do
you
think
that
is
the
kind
of
a
case
this
court
would
review
under
any
circumstances,
an
abuse
of
discretion,
even
if
it
was
the
grossest
kind
of
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
byron
r.
white
here
at
a-35
it
says
two
questions
are
presented.
this
is
in
the
petition
for
intermediate
appeal.
one
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
but
secondly,
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
statement
made
after
having
been
advised
of
miranda
rights
and
after
having
waived
those
rights
would
in
any
case
be
admissible
regardless
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
that
subsume
the
admissibility
of
the
statements
on
other
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
doesn't
it?
it
just
says
are
there
any
other
reasons
with
respect
to
a
disability.
no.
i
think
isn't
a
fair
reading
of
that
second
question
that
it
refers
to
the
"i'm
too
drunk"
comment,
which
they
then
did
reverse
on
and
remand
for
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
very
tactful,
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
just
ask
you.
your
petition,
your
motion
to
suppress
was
based
solely
on
constitutional
grounds,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
make
the
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
further
grounds
that
the
procedures
utilized
by
the
arresting
officer
in
advising
the
defendant
of
his
potential
rights
were
violative
of
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
think
the
trial
court's
ruling...
and
you
submitted
the
findings
of
fact,
the
proposed
findings
of
fact,
and
he
adopted
them,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
signed
them.
and
on
page
829
at
roman
numeral
iii,
is
that
based
on
a
state
statute
or
is
that
a
holding
that
failure
to
advise
of
the
right
to...
failure
to
advise
that
the
refusal
could
be
used
against
him
and
failure
to
advise
of
his
right
to
counsel,
are
those
constitutional
rulings?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
based
on
the
state
statute
or
the
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
arguably
it
could
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
that
is
what
you
said
it
was.
that
is
what
your
motion
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
this
doesn't
refer
to
the
statute.
i
suppose,
whether
it
is
federal
or
state
ground,
it
is
still
the
law
of
the
case,
which
we
have
no
power
to
review
unless
it
has
been
raised--
--it
sure
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
it
strange;
it
really
is
strange
that
the
state
would
appeal
one
ground
for
excluding
the
evidence
but
it
would
make
absolutely
no
difference
in
the
disposition
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
will
this
evidence
ever
be
admissible?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
we
reverse
this
judgment
and
say
it
is
quite
constitutional
to
introduce
the
evidence,
at
least
as
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned,
it
is
constitutional,
it
is
not
forbidden.
how
can
you
ever
get
the
evidence
in
in
the
light
of
these
rulings
in
the
trial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
is
a
ruling
that
the
failure
to
advise
him
excludes
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
remanded
it
back
for
voluntariness.
