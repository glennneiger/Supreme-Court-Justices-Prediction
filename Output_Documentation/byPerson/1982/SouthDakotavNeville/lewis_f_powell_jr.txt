justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
before
you
go
on,
i
think
your
brief
expressly
agrees
that
the
issue
before
us
was
stated
correctly
in
the
attorney
general's
brief,
and
that,
of
course,
was
only
the
constitutional
question.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course,
agreement
can't
confer
jurisdiction
on
us,
but
i'm
wondering
now
what
is
your
position.
in
other
words,
what
do
you
urge
us
to
do?
