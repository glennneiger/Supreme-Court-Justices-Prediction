justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
the
state
prevails
on
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
court,
nevertheless
your
courts
may
reaffirm
the
setting
aside
of
the
conviction
on
one
of
the
other
two
grounds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
hasn't
been
any
trial
here,
yet.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
only
on
appeal
from
denial...
or
grant
of
a
motion
to
suppress.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
you
thought
when
we
granted
the
cert,
that
issue
had
been
resolved
by
our
grant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
this
is
a
compelled
refusal.
as
i
understand
it,
the
statute
gives
him
a
privilege
to
refuse,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it?
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
how
is
it
compelled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
could
under
schmerber
be
compelled
to
give
the
blood
sample,
could
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
could
have
strapped
him
down
and
just
gone
ahead
and
taken
it,
as
long
as
they
had
appropriate
medical
procedures.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
the
state
was
after
was
the
blood
sample,
was
it
not?
the
state
wasn't
after
a
refusal.
they
are
not
interested
in
the
refusal.
they
didn't
want
to
have
evidence...
they
wanted
the
blood
test
so
they
could
make
a
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
intoxicated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
have
difficulty
understanding
how
you
can
argue
there
is
any
compelled
refusal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
very
strange.
