chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
can
be
compelled
in
an
open
court,
can
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
easier,
i
suppose,
to
compel
a
breathalyzer
test
or
a
blood
test
than
it
is
a
handwriting
test
because
you
can't
tie
a
man
down
and
force
him
to
give
a
handwriting
example,
can
you,
but
you
can
tie
him
down
and
take
a
blood
test
or
a
breathalyzer
test.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
you
in
effect
arguing
that
since
the
court
has
held
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
state
to
compel,
to
compel
the
extraction
of
blood,
a
fortiori
if
the
blood
is
admissible,
the
refusal
to
do
it
is
admissible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we
will
resume
there
and
have
your
argument
at
1
o'clock,
counsel.
mr.
gienapp,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
was
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
conceding,
at
least
sub
silentio,
that
there
was
no
constitutional
issue
involved,
if
they
were
inviting
the
legislature
to
pass
a
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
said
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
you
said.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
your
interpretation
of
it?
i
thought
that
is
what
you
said.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
on
state
constitutional
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
curious
that
in
the
earlier
case
that
you
referred
to,
that
they
made
no
reference
to
any
state
constitutional
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
trial
judge
explain
why
he
thought
it
was
irrelevant,
and
if
he
didn't,
do
you
have
any
suggestion
as
to
support
that
ruling?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
irrelevancy
was
hardly
the
correct
label
for
that
if
that
was
the
basis
of
the
ruling.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
understand
that.
that
this
evidence,
if
we
reverse
and
send
it
back
as
a
new
trial,
that
this
evidence
is
not
going
to
be
admitted
in
evidence.
and
why?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
irrelevancy
was
one
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
it
is
a
different
trial
judge,
who
might
think
that
this
was
quite
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
an
advisory
opinion
when
that
is
the
only
question
that
brings
you
two
gentlemen
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
we
aren't
bound
by
what
either
of
you
say,
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
stand
mute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
refuse
to
speak.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
clarify
that.
if
he
doesn't
shake
his
head
one
way
or
the
other,
doesn't
utter
a
word,
stands
mute
in
the
literal
sense,
do
you
say
that
south
dakota
law
makes
that
testimonial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
is
testimonial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
including
standing
mute
and
saying
nothing
and
refusing
to
submit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
is
irrelevant,
there
was
no
need
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
went
back
to
the
trial
court
in
your
state,
and
the
judge
enters
and
makes
findings
and
conclusions
in
which
he
just
says
it
is
irrelevant,
period,
then
that
is
subject
to
review
by
the
higher
courts
in
the
state
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
basis,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
we
have
any
authority
to
review
an
abuse
of
discretion
issue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
south
dakota
against
neville
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
justice
o'connor.
