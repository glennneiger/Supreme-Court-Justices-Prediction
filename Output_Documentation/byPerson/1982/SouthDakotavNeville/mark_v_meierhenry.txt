mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
from
the
state
of
south
dakota,
and
it
was
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
granted
in
may
of
this
year
to
review
a
case
involving
the
refusal
by
an
individual
in
the
state
of
south
dakota
to
submit
to
a
blood
test.
the
facts
are
very
brief
but
important
to
this
issuer,
and
i
will
go
through
them
quickly.
about
9
o'clock
in
the
evening
of
the
19th
of
july,
1980,
the
defendant
was
stopped
by
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
city
of
madison,
south
dakota.
he
was
stopped
for
the
reason
that
he
failed
to
stop
at
a
stop
sign,
and
when
he
was
pulled
over,
he
was
asked
two
questions:
number
one,
to
get
out
of
the
car,
and
number
two,
for
his
driver's
license.
as
he
got
out
of
the
automobile,
he
staggered,
fell
against
the
car
to,
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
the
officer,
get
his
balance.
he
also
smelled
of
alcohol,
the
odor
of
alcohol.
when
asked
for
his
driver's
license,
he
said:
i'm
not
going
to
lie
to
you,
i
don't
have
one,
i
lost
it
because
of
a
prior
dwi...
which
is
driving
while
intoxicated,
our
statute
in
south
dakota.
after
he
failed
a
series
of
sobriety
tests,
he
was
taken
down
to
the
station.
he
was
advised
of
his
miranda
warnings
and
he
was
advised
of
the
south
dakota
implied
consent
statute
and
asked
if
he
would
take
a
blood
test,
and
he
refused.
he
was
read
the
implied
consent
statute
a
second
time,
he
refused
a
second
time,
and
on
the
third
occasion,
he
again
was
read
the
implied
consent
statute
and
he
refused.
that
was
at
the
police
station.
the
defendant
made
a
motion
to
suppress
his
statements,
his
refusal
to
take
this
blood
test,
and
the
trial
court
did
suppress
the
refusal
and
any
related
evidence,
basically
on
three
grounds:
number
one,
that
the
statute
of
south
dakota
was
unconstitutional;
number
two,
that
it
was
not
relevant
evidence;
and
number
three,
that
mr.
neville
had
not
been
advised
that
if
he
refused
to
take
the
test,
that
fact
of
refusal
would
be
used
against
him.
and
i
will
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
law
changed
in
south
dakota.
it
was
passed,
became
effective
july
1,
1980.
this
occurrence
was
some
19
days
after
the
passage
of
that
statute.
and
that
statute
in
part
reads:
"if
a
person
refuses
to
submit
to
chemical
analysis
of
his
blood,
urine,
breath
or
other
bodily
substance
as
provided
in
other
subsections,
such
refusal
may
be
admissible
into
evidence
at
the
trial.
"
this
court
granted
the
state's
request
to
look
at
this
issue,
whether
this
statute
that
i
have
just
read
to
you...
which
allows
the
fact
of
the
refusal
to
take
a
test
to
determine
blood
alcohol
content
of
a
motorist
to
be
admitted
into
evidence
at
the
subsequent
trial
of
the
motorist
for
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
alcohol...
violates
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
if
you
look
in
the
appendix
on
page
9,
there
is
a
card
that
is
given
to
each
police
officer
that
is
a
part
of
the
statute
and
explains
their
rights.
it
does
inform
them
if
they
do
not
take
the
test
they
may
lose
their
license
for
up
to
a
year.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
perhaps.
i
guess
i
would
point
out
that
the
reason
this
individual
was
not
advised
of
the
fact
that
his
refusal
could
be
used
against
him
is
explained
by
the
police
officer
in
the
appendix,
which
is
the
cards
from
pierre,
which
is
the
state
capitol
and
where
these
things
are
mailed
out
of,
had
not
updated
the
new
card.
i
might
inform
the
court
now
that
each
individual,
if
this
is
found
constitutional,
and
are,
in
fact,
being
advised
that
the
refusal
could
be
used
against
them.
so
that
portion
of
the
case,
because
of
this
19
days,
the
bureaucracy
did
not
set
into
operation
quick
enough,
is
the
only
reason
that
this
individual
was
not
so
advised.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
i
don't
believe
it
would,
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
would
not
make
it
so
inadmissible.
it
might
be
something
that
the
state
court
would
consider,
but
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
but
that
issue
has
been
remanded
back
to
the
trial
court.
the
only
thing
that
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
decided
was
that
the
statute
itself
was
unconstitutional
because
it
violated
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
i
think
not
because
that
goes
more
to
the
matter
of...
he
also
ruled
as
to
relevancy,
which
could
change
from
judge
to
judge.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
but
this
court
can
decide
the
issue
of
whether
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
it
will
under
south
dakota
law
because
i
think
these
other
matters
will
fall
into
place
after
that,
if
it
is
admissible
and
not
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
the
relevancy
issue,
first
of
all,
can
be
decided
because
the
legislature,
in
the
first
place,
said
it's
relevant.
this
was
on
a
motion
to
suppress,
i
might
point
out.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
there
has
been
no
trial.
number
one,
our
legislature
has
said
in
the
statute
it
is
relevant,
so
i
think
that
issue
is
a
matter
of
evidentiary
law
in
our
state;
the
trial
judge
was
just
erroneous,
he
is
wrong
on
that
issue.
and
i
think
that
had
that
issue
been
covered
or
approached
by
our
south
dakota
supreme
court,
the
trial
judge
may
have
been
overruled
on
that
point,
and
i
would
have
to
say
to
the
court
we
are
speculating
at
that
point.
but
on
that
point
i
think
it
is
clearly
relevant,
mainly
because
the
legislature
says
it
is,
plus
some
evidentiary
reasons.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
guess...
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
the
answer,
quickly,
is
yes,
we
could.
what
the
state
wants
is
the
results
of
the
test.
not
before
this
court
are
the
statements.
that
has
not,
again,
been
reached
by
the
south
dakota
supreme
court.
but--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
i
think
you
must
decide
it
because,
if
you
will
look
at
the
lower
court,
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
case
in
a
footnote,
they
are
obviously
going
to
follow
this
court
in
the
sense
that
as
arbitrator
of
the
fifth
amendment,
plus
i
don't
believe
they
ever
considered
the
relevancy
issue.
if
they
did,
they
would
have
to
rule,
and
they
did,
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
of
relevancy,
and
i
don't
see
how
relevancy--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
correct.
but
i
believe
if
you
will
look
at
a
footnote,
i
believe
it
is
footnote...
not
the
famous
footnote
9
in
schmerber,
but
i
think
it
is
also
footnote
9
in
the
northwestern
citation,
that
they
have
in
effect
indicated
that
the
fifth
amendment,
as
pointed
out
by
this
court,
although
our
amendment
to
our
state
constitution
has
a
little
different
wording,
that
they
would
take
the
same
interpretation
and
it
is
not
more
expansive
than
found
here.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
is
correct.
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
fact
of
refusal--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that's
true.
and
in
most
regards
these--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
guess
we
can't
go
forward
in
state
court
unless
the
fifth
amendment...
the
primary
issue
is
the
fifth
amendment,
and
as
this
court
knows,
we
have
two
appellate
circuits
of
the
federal
system,
states
on
either
side
of
the
issue.
our
statute
that
talks
about
the
refusal,
we
feel,
is
within
the
fifth
amendment.
the
evidence
we
are
searching
for,
which
is
the
evidence
that
disappears...
the
minute
the
individual
is
arrested
and
taken
into
custody,
it
begins
to
disappear,
it's
evidence
that
will
disappear--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--well,
i
think
the
test--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--we
are
not
submitting
at
this
point
that
we
could
get
his
comments
in.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
but
we
believe
that
our
south
dakota
legislature
in
passing
this
statute
that
allows
the
fact
of
refusal
to
be
put
into
evidence
had
a
number
of
things
in
mind:
first
of
all,
to
remove,
or
to
rather
allow
the
jury
to
know
all
the
facts,
number
one.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
think
it's
important
that
when
we
look
at
the
trial
of
cases,
i
mean
the
day-to-day
functioning
of
our
lowest
courts
that
try
these
matters,
that
we
take
certain
things
into
account.
first
of
all,
this
is
a
subject
that
is
well
known
by
the
population.
we
even
have
lawyers
that
have
some
reputation
writing
books
on
the
best
seller
list
about
driving
while
intoxicated.
so
it
is
something
people
know
about.
i
doubt
if
you
can
take
12
citizens
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
put
them
in
the
jury
room,
and
they
aren't
aware
that
there
is
blood
tests
and
should
be
in
cases.
so
it
is
important,
number
one,
that
those
of
us
that
enforce
the
law
can
show
the
jury
that
we
have
done
it
adequately
and
properly.
on
the
back
of
every
south
dakota
driver's
license
this
implied
consent
law
is
written.
the
individual
in
the
jury
room
can
pull
out
his
driver's
license
and
know
there
should
be
a
blood
test
and
that
there
is
a
duty
and
a
requirement
to
take
it.
and
we
should
be
able
to
indicate
to
the
jury
first
of
all
we
have
followed
the
proper
procedures,
we
allowed
this
individual
or
at
least
offered
the
blood
test
to
them,
and
if
they
did
not
avail
themselves
of
it,
fine.
we
should
also
be
able
to
put
that
in.
so
it
is
relevant
to
show,
first
of
all,
that
we
have
followed
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
in
the
handling
of
a
defendant.
secondly,
it
does
show
consciousness
of
guilt,
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
federal
system,
and
it
is
part
of
the
progeny
of
gilbert
v.
california,
the
fisher
case
and
the
enge
case,
but
i
thought
it
interesting
to
see
what
would
a
federal
district
judge
do
when
he
reads
and
finds
out
that,
number
one,
handwriting
samples
are
admissible,
and
so
he
issues
an
order...
and
this
is
not
pleading
evidence,
a
handwriting
samples,
obviously...
he
orders
the
defendant
to
give
the
court
or
the
prosecution
a
sample
of
his
handwriting
and
he
fails
to
do
so.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
he
can,
your
honor,
and
u.s.
v.
askew
upheld
that
out
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
this
court
denied
cert.
well,
what
is
even
more
interesting
is
what
happens
to
that
right
of
refusal.
here
is
the
suggested
pattern
federal
jury
instructions,
out
of
divett
and
blackmar,
and
i'm
paraphrasing
a
little
bit,
but
here
is
what
the
judge
would
tell
the
jury
in
a
federal
case:
there
is
evidence
that
the
defendant
after
his
arrest
refused
to
furnish
a
sample
of
his
handwriting.
it
was
a
lawful
order
and
not
in
violation
of
the
defendant's
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
refusal
to
obey
the
order
is
not
sufficient
to
show
guilt.
you
may,
however,
consider
the
defendant's
refusal
and
may
give
it
such
weight
as
you
think
it
is
entitled
to
as
tending
to
prove
consciousness
of
guilt.
that
is
what
would
happen
in
the
federal
system,
not
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
handwriting,
and
an
inference
of
guilt
or
at
least
tending
to
prove
consciousness
of
guilt.
now,
divett
and
blackmar
is
not
the
supreme
court,
obviously,
but
it
is
the
suggested
pattern
jury
instructions
that
we
all
use
and
has
not
been
found
by
any
court
to
be
improper.
so
here
south
dakota
tried
to
fashion
a
remedy,
and
all
the
court
is
aware
of
the
reason
for
these
implied
consent
laws,
and
we
are
another
state,
don't
want
to
hold
our
citizens
down
and
forcefully
take
this
blood
sample.
we
don't
want
that
in
the
state
of
south
dakota.
but
we
have
made
some
conditions.
one
of
the
conditions
not
discussed
here
is
that
if
you
refuse
to
take
your
blood
test,
you
lose
your
license
for
one
year.
that
is
also
common.
but
we
have
got
another
hooker
in
south
dakota,
and
it
is
if
you
don't
take
the
test,
you
automatically
lose
your
license
for
a
year,
but
if
you
plead
guilty
before
the
separate
hearing
on
the
refusal,
the
civil
hearing
on
the
refusal,
then
we
won't
take
your
driver's
license
away.
so
in
a
way,
even
though
you
refuse,
if
you
plead
guilty,
admit
your
guilt,
which
is
some
kind
of
compulsion,
you
aren't
going
to
lose
your
license
for
a
year.
obviously,
that
is
usually
to
the
defendant's
advantage
and
it
hasn't
been--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--no,
because
i
think
only
those
defendants...
we
have
discussed
that
before.
probably
the
only
time
we
would
see
it
is
on
the
third
offense.
it
is
a
felony.
if
an
individual
took
an
opportunity
on
his
second
offense
to
do
so,
he
may
go
in
and
attack
in
the
federal
system
his
plea
on
the
second
offense,
trying
to
throw
that
out
so
it
isn't
a
felony,
because
the
third
offense
is
a
felony.
that
is
the
only
reason
i
could
ever
see
you
would
see
it
in
the
federal
courts,
is
an
attempt
to
play
the
system
against
itself
and
say
"i
was
compelled".
so
if
you
look
at
the
handwriting
sample,
which
some
of
the
justices
of
this
court
in
various
decisions
have
said
is
a
real
physical
evidence,
if
you
can
compel
in
the
federal
system
someone
to
take
a
handwriting
sample,
you
can
compel
them
to
take
a
blood
test.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
some
other
things
that
are
involved,
too.
handwriting
is
hand
writing,
and
in
the
askew
case
it
took
19
months
for
the
federal
judge
to
get
a
sample.
maybe
he
learned
to
write
left-handed
in
the
meantime
or
something.
but
i
think
the
fact
is
it
is
pleading
evidence
and
it
is
scientifically
acceptable.
we
know
when
we
talk
about
a
1.5
blood
count
in
courts,
and
the
jury,
perhaps,
knows
what
the
issue
is,
what
we
are
talking
about.
it
is
probably
the
best
evidence
there
is.
it
protects
mr.
gienapp's
client
as
much
as
it
helps
the
state
in
determining
what
is
his
blood
count.
if
mr.
mason...
or
mr.
neville,
i
mean,
who
is
experienced
in
this
area,
would
have
come
out
with
a.05,
he
probably
would
have
never
faced
the
charges.
so
it
is
an
independent
test
that
is
reliable
and
valuable,
whereas
otherwise
you
are
left
with
oral
testimony:
staggering,
slurred
speech.
so
we
believe
that
the
south
dakota
statutory
scheme,
which
is
similar
to
most,
is
constitutional,
and
the
refusal
that
we
are
arguing
here
today
is
not
that
his
words
can
go
in...
"i'm
too
drunk,
i
can't
pass
the
test.
"
it
is
simply
that
another
witness,
maybe
it's
the
nurse...
ours
is
required
to
be
taken
by
medical
people...
that
a
nurse,
medical
technician
or
the
officer
observed
the
defendant
refused
to
take
the
test.
and
then
the
jury
knows
why.
those
of
us
that
have
defended
and
prosecuted
these
cases,
you
must
realize...
just
as
was
pointed
out
in
this
court
when
you
approved
the
instruction
of
possession
of
recently
stolen
property...
there
are
certain
things
in
life
that
this
court
can
recognize
and
know
goes
into
criminal
cases
or
into
the
affairs
of
life,
and
one
of
them
is
in
a
driving
while
intoxicated
case,
the
jury
expects
a
blood
test.
they
are
waiting
to
see
the
blood
test.
and
the
state,
if
it
puts
in
its
refusal,
it
settles
the
issue.
there
is
no
blood
test
because
none
was
taken.
it
isn't
that
it
was
a
bad
test
and
the
state
didn't
want
to
put
it
in
and
is
in
some
way
trying
to
push
guilt
onto
this
person.
on
the
other
hand,
it
isn't
as
if
something
was
done
improperly
and
the
court
didn't
allow
it.
it
isn't
the
defendant
through
some
lawyer's
trick
keeping
this
from
us
so
that
we
don't
know
what
the
blood
test
is.
it
is
simply
a
physical
and
real
fact
that
no
blood
test
exists,
and
that
is
as
real
and
physical
as
handwriting
or
any
of
the
other
factors
that
we
can
put
into
evidence.
so
it
is
in
a
way
the
type
of
real
evidence
that
under
our
system
that
the
jury
expects
to
see
and
should
see.
they
should
be
told
the
whole
facts
because,
otherwise,
what
happens?
and
this
court
has
read
the
record
and
all
of
us
are
familiar.
the
officer
is
told:
forget
these
facts;
testify
truthfully
about
everything,
but
leave
this
out.
you
can
testify
as
to
the
individual's
slurred
speech,
you
can
testify
to
all
these
matters,
but
when
you
get
down
to
the
station
house
and
the
defendant
exercises
his
statutory
power
to
refuse,
even
though
our
legislature
said
to
be
a
driver
in
south
dakota
you
have
to
agree
to
take
this
blood
test,
that
is
a
requirement
on
our
citizens,
but
we
are
going
to
give
you
the
power
to
refuse...
not
the
right
to
refuse...
i
think
that's
a
misnomer
in
all
the
cases...
the
power
to
refuse,
and
he
exercises
that
power,
we
are
going
to
inform
the
fellow
citizens
on
the
jury
why
there
is
no
blood
test,
why
they
haven't
gotten
what
most
of
us
expect
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
think
that
all
of
us
would
look
at
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
and
try
to
determine
how
much
of
the
words
we
can
put
in.
i
think
you
would
expect
this
type
of
record
to
come
out:
question:
"was
he
given
a
blood
test?
"
"no,
he
wasn't".
"did
you
offer
him
one"?
"yes,
i
did".
"well,
why
didn't
he
take
the
blood
test?
"
"i
read
him
the
implied
consent
clauses--
"
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
i
was
going
to
get
to
it,
and
i
would
say
by
his
words
and
actions
he
indicated
he
refused.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
because
it
is
going
to
be
different--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--i
guess
the
state
believes
we
do
have
a
right
to
do
it.
i
guess
in
the
limiting
nature
of
the
question
presented
and
ruled
upon
in
the
lower
court,
we
feel,
i
guess,
it
would
be
dicta
in
this
case
to
do
so.
but
we
believe
we
should
be
able
to
put
those
comments
in.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
we
submit
that
first
of
all,
the
evidence
itself
is
constitutional.
it
would
appear
that
schmerber
has
said
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
we
are
saying
that
the
blood,
were
it
taken
from
the
individual
over
his
objection,
could
be
offered
at
trial.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
is
what
we
would
say,
that
the
base
evidence
that
we
are
seeking
here,
and
the
state
prefers
to
have
rather
than
a
refusal,
is
a
blood
test.
we
can
draw
the
blood,
we
can
give
it
to
another
witness,
and
the
results
of
those
tests
can
be
testified
to.
that
is
the
base
evidence.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
is
correct.
and
i
believe
every
state
jurisdiction
has
used
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
the
schmerber
case
and
so
forth
and
made
all
kinds
of
different
interpretations
of
what
the
fifth
amendment
says,
and
only
this
court
can
do
that
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
u.s.
constitution.
our
court
has
indicated
that
it
will
follow
the
lead
of
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
on
what
the
fifth
amendment
means,
obviously,
and
secondary,
that
our
state
constitution,
although
they
used
slightly
different
words,
will
follow
the
fifth
amendment
precept
under
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
i
believe
it
follows.
i
believe
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
unusual
is
legislatures,
some
legislatures
have
given
the
individual
the
power
to
refuse,
the
power
not
to
have
their
body
invaded;
but
then
they
have
also
put
the
duty
to
take
the
consequences,
which
are
not
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
consequences
are
not
as
extreme
as
what
would
be
allowed
under
the
united
states
constitution
of
taking
it
by
force.
so
we
feel
that
it
is
logical
to
say
that
the
fact
it
doesn't
exist
is
through
no
fault
of
the
state's,
is
not
the
state's
fault.
this
individual
exercised
his
power
by
statute
not
to
have
the
test
taken,
and
that
should
be
brought
to
the
fact
finder.
i
can't
imagine
a
state
or
federal
judge
trying
one
of
these
cases
not
listening
to
why
there
wasn't
a
blood
test.
he
may
say,
well,
i'm
going
to
hear
it
and
then
if
it's
irrelevant
i
will
strike
it
out,
as
all
of
us
are
familiar
that
court
trials
do.
i
can't
believe
anyone
trying
to
find
the
facts
of
this
issue
would
not
expect
to
know
why
there
wasn't
a
blood
test:
why
hasn't
the
state
done
its
job;
where
is
this
blood
test?
that
is
to
our
disadvantage,
obviously,
and
we
wouldn't
want
to
put
it
in
if
it
wouldn't
help
us,
obviously.
but
the
public
has
a
right
to
know...
or
the
jury,
i
should
say,
the
jury
has
a
right
to
know
what
are
the
facts
of
this
case
as
long
as
it
doesn't
violate
the
fifth
amendment,
and
it
does
not,
in
our
opinion,
because...
obviously
we
can
take
the
handwriting
example.
to
me
it
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
the
refusal,
that
fact,
should
be
put
in.
it
goes
to
the
indication
of
intoxication.
we
can
testify
as
to
slurred
speech,
not
necessarily,
depending
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
miranda
warning,
what
was
said;
but
the
manner
in
which
an
individual
talked
is
something
the
officer
can
comment
on,
that
he
staggered.
all
these
things
are
observations
that
have
to
be
testified
to.
and
when
we
come
to
the
test,
we
are
saying
it
is
in
the
same
regard.
had
he
done
what
state
law
requires,
there
would
be
a
test.
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
the
refusal
or
any
of
his
comments.
had
he
done
what
he
agreed
to
do
when
he
got
his
south
dakota
driver's
license
or
operate
a
motor
vehicle
in
our
state,
he
would
have
consented
to
the
blood
test.
but
he
exercised
his
power
not
to
do
so.
it
seems
very
reasonable
under
the
united
states
constitution
that
a
state
attempting
to
give
its
citizens
or
any
visitors
the
power
to
refuse
this
bodily
intrusion
are
then
more
limited
in
their
evidentiary
presentation
to
a
jury
than
if
they
said,
we
don't
care,
we
don't
care,
we're
going
to
hold
them
down,
we're
going
to
hire
big
officers
and
we're
going
to
find
large
nurses
and
we're
going
to
take
the
blood
tests,
and
then
we're
going
to
put
in
the
evidence
of
how
the
individual
struggled
and
swore
and
punched
someone,
then
we
have
a
felony,
perhaps,
assaulting
an
officer.
this
is
not
reasonable.
this
is
not
what
the
fifth
amendment
should
do
when
a
state
is
attempting
to
have,
through
a
power
that
it
has
been
issued,
a
reasonable
way
in
which
to
get
evidence
which
is
allowed
under
the
fifth
amendment.
we
would
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment,
and
i
would
keep
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
we
respectfully
disagree
with
our
colleague
here.
if
you
will
look
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
the
statute
that
is
19-13-28.1.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that
says,
notwithstanding
another
provision,
such
refusal...
it
says
that
if
someone
violates
32-23-10,
such
refusal
is
admissible
into
evidence.
but
it
all
hangs
upon
whether
or
not
10.1
is
constitutional.
if
it
is
not
constitutional,
then
this
is
a
nullity
because
we
can't
use
the
fruits
of
an
unconstitutional
statute
to
admit
it.
i
disagree
with
mr.
gienapp.
the
relevancy
issue
falls,
and
he
says
the
right,
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--yes,
it
will.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
very
clearly,
because
then
the
statute
19-13-28.1
says
that
the
refusal
evidence
is
admissible
without
regard
to
relevancy,
without
regard
to
what
mr.
gienapp
misintends.
he
refers
back
to
the
fact
that
you
have
to
be
advised
that
if
you
don't
take
the
test,
you
could
lose
your
license
for
a
year.
our
legislature
nor
no
court
has
ever
said
you
have
to
be
advised
that
your
refusal
will
be
used
against
you.
that
has
not
been...
i
disagree
with
mr.
gienapp
on
that
point.
the
state's
position
is
that
if--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--it
is
the
state's
position
that
should
this
court
find
that
this
is
constitutional,
the
trial
judge
does
not
have
the
discretion
and
would
subsequently
reverse
his
ruling.
his
ruling
is
based
first
of
all
that
it
is
unconstitutional.
since
it
is
unconstitutional,
then
he
would
have
to
have
an
advising
of
rights,
and
besides
that,
he
says,
since
this
is
unconstitutional--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--it
is
irrelevant.
what
we
are
contending
to
this
court
is
that
we
need
a
final
judgment
here.
to
argue
otherwise
as
if
any
trial
judge
in
our
state
always
held
that
it
is
irrelevant
and
it
is
also
unconstitutional,
we
would
never
get
the
issue
presented
to
anyone.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
well,
we
think
it
is
clear...
it
was
remanded
back
on
a
miranda
issue.
obviously,
why
would
they
remand
it
back
if
it
were
irrelevant.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
yes,
but
that
goes
to
relevancy.
why
would
they
remand
it
if
it
was
irrelevant?
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
why
would
we
go
through
the
trauma
of
going
through--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--but
that
only
occurred
in
the
response,
the
refusal.
no.
and
of
course,
we
have
adopted
basically
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--because
they
interpreted
this
court's
ruling
under
schmerber
to
be
it
was
unconstitutional,
just
as
the
trial
judge
did.
if
that
is
the
case,
your
honor,
then
it
also
makes
a
nullity
our
subsequent
statute
that
says
it
is
admissible.
mr.
gienapp
used--
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
--that
is
perhaps
true,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
v.
meierhenry
no,
i
don't...
obviously
not.
it
would
not
involve
any
federal
question
or
constitutional
issue
on
the
part
of
the
state.
thank
you.
