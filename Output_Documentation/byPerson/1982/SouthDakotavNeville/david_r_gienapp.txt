mr.
david
r.
gienapp
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
attorney
general
has
indicated,
the
issue
in
this
particular
case
presented
to
this
court
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
south
dakota
statute
allowing
into
evidence
an
individual's
refusal
to
take
a
blood
alcohol
test.
this
refusal
is
committed
pursuant
to
a
south
dakota
statute
that
was
in
existence
long
before
this
statute.
since
1960
south
dakota
has
statutorily
allowed
an
individual
to
refuse
to
take
a
blood
alcohol
test,
not
without
some
certain
civil
penalties,
but
allowed
that
permission.
in
1980
this
statute
was
passed
by
the
south
dakota
legislature
allowing
evidence
of
that
refusal
into
evidence
at
the
trial
for
the
dwi,
which
is
the
south
dakota
vernacular,
i
guess,
for
driving
while
intoxicated,
the
formal
charge
in
south
dakota.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
it
was
perhaps
a
year
and
a
half
later
after
a
decision
of
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
that
held
that
such
a
refusal
was
not
admissible
without
a
statute,
basically.
i
believe
that
case
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
and
i
believe
it
is
state
v.
oswald.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
no,
i
don't
believe
they
really
invited
the
legislature--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--well,
i
don't
know
if
they
specifically
said
in
the
absence
of
a
statute.
that
is
an
interpretation
that
was
given
to
it
when
the
statute
presently
in
existence
was
presented--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--no,
your
honor.
my
interpretation
is
that
they
merely
said
point
blank
it's
not
admissible,
not
referring
to
the
constitutional
issue
or
otherwise.
there
was
a
subsequent
case
where
they
inferred
that
there
was
not
a
constitutional
issue,
which
they
specifically
overruled
in
their
decision
in
state
v.
neville.
referring
briefly
to
the
attorney
general's
comments
on
the
background
of
this
case,
the
motion
to
suppress
was
made
and
granted
on
three
separate
and
distinct
grounds,
one
of
them
being
the
constitutional
issue,
one
of
them
being
the
relevancy
issue,
and
one
of
them
being
the
issue
that
the
arresting
officer
did
not
comply
with
the
statutory
procedure
under
south
dakota
law
prior
to
asking
for
the
blood
alcohol
test,
a
statute
which
is
a
situation
that
is
precedent
to
taking
that
particular
test.
the
appeal
was
made
to
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
only
on
the
constitutional
grounds.
the
other
two
grounds
granted
at
the
trial
court
level
remain
and
stand
today.
the
attorney
general
indicated
that
the
statute
is
relevant
and
that
a
ruling
that
it
was
irrelevant
under
the
statute
by
the
trial
judge...
i
don't
agree
with
that
particular
comment
because
the
statute
as
it
is
worded
is
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge.
it
does
not
say
it
is
admissible,
it
does
not
say
it
shall
be
admissible;
it
says
it
may
be
admissible.
the
trial
judge
in
this
particular
case
ruled
that
it
was
not
admissible
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
irrelevant
and
immaterial
to
that
particular
factual
situation.
the
issue
as
it
is
presented
to
this
court
is
solely
on
the
constitutionality
and
solely
on
the
fifth
amendment
aspect
of
the
case.
it
is
petitioner's...
respondent's
position
that
this
particular
statute
is
unconstitutional,
is
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
for
the
reasons
set
forth
in
schmerber
v.
california
and
for
the
logic
that
follows
those
particular
reasons.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
i
question
jurisdiction,
your
honor,
in
my
reply
to
the
writ
for
certiorari.
i
question
whether
there
is
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
because
of
two
other
grounds
that
the
matter
has
already
been
suppressed
on
at
the
trial
court
level
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
no,
these
are...
yes,
these
are
independent
state
grounds,
although
they
have
not
been
rule
on
per
se
by
the
south
dakota
supreme
court.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that
would
be
a
possibility
also.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
no,
they
did
not,
not
in
state
v.
oswald,
and
i
don't
believe
in
state
v.
maher
did
they
either.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
they
would
have
the
chance
to
have
the
federal
question
reviewed
in
a
different
case
where
there
was
not
the
error
in
following
statutory
procedures
in
advising
someone
of
the
implied
consent
right,
or--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
could
i
follow
up
one
further
comment,
justice
rehnquist.
the
south
dakota
decision,
though,
did
decide
it
on
both
the
state
and
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
their
history
has
been
such
that
they
do
not.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
he
is
convicted,
it
would
be
likewise;
the
issue
would
not
be
reviewed
because
i,
obviously,
would
not
raise
it
if
it
were
not
introduced
at
the
trial
court
level.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that
is
correct,
and
also--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
the
trial
court
did
not
explain
why
it
was
irrelevant,
your
honor,
at
least
that
i
can
recall,
and
it
is
not
in
the
record.
my
explanation
might
very
possibly
be
that
the
south
dakota
statute
that
we
are
referring
to,
of
course,
is
discretionary,
as
i
have
defined.
it
says
may
be
admissible.
south
dakota
has
an
evidentiary
rule
much
like
the
federal
rule
which
says
that
evidence
should
not
be
admitted
unless
its
probative
value
exceeds
its
prejudicial
effect,
or
vice-versa.
that
would
be
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
could
see
for
a
trial
judge
making
such
a
decision.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
could
be.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
not
in
this
particular
case,
no.
they
did
not
raise
those
on
the
intermediate
appeal,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that
is
my
interpretation
of
it,
and
i
feel
that
i
raised
that
to
some
extent.
i
haven't
raised
it
in
my
briefs
here,
but
i
raised
it.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
it
is
a
question
of
finality
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
ruling
within
the
state.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that
is
my
interpretation
of
what
has
taken
place
up
to
this
time,
your
honor.
in
the
petition...
or
in
the
south
dakota
supreme
court,
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
made
the
general
statement
that
other
issues
raised,
we
don't
need
to
reach
or
we
deem
to
be
without
merit.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that
is
my
recollection,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--the
petition
for
intermediate
appeal--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--the
petition
for
intermediate
appeal,
sir...
i
don't
have
the
case,
or
the
page
number
off
the
top
of
my
head...
is
embodied
in
the
appendix
for
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
and
that
would
specify
the
entire
reasons
for
the
appeal
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
yes.
it's
on
page
a-33
of
the...
excuse
me...
of
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
i
guess...
let
me
correct
myself
in
looking
at
this
petition
for
intermediate
appeal.
the
petition
says
the
appeal
is
from
the
entire
order,
a
portion
which
declares
it
unconstitutional.
so
the
reference
is
to
the
entire
order,
but
the
other
portions
of
the
order
were
basically
affirmed
by
the
south
dakota
supreme
court.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
or
deemed
them
to
be
without
merit.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that
basically
does
not
include,
first
of
all,
the
third
ground,
which
relates
to
the
statutory
requirements.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
and
those
were
the
only
two
issues
briefed,
basically,
in
the
south
dakota
supreme
court,
that
particular
situation.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
yes.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
they
remanded
the
propriety
of
the
statement
for
further
trial
court
proceedings
within
the
confines
of
miranda.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
basically,
your
honor,
i
have
no
problem
with
the
court
deciding
the
issue.
i
did
raise
the
issue
in
my
reply
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
i
did
raise
it
at
that
particular
level.
i
did
not
raise
it
in
this
brief.
i
guess
i
am
placed
in
a
position
where
i
am
representing
an
individual
client
technically
in
this
particular
case.
regardless,
in
my
opinion,
regardless
of
whether
this
court
reaches
the
issue
or
not,
it
is
not
going
to
be
introduced
against
my
individual
client.
i
hope
that
is
some
type
of
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
because
of
the
other
two
grounds
found
at
the
trial
court
level
for
the
non-admissibility
of
this
particular--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--right.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
then
i
get
into
the
res
judicata
rule
of
the
case
situation.
i
would
argue
that--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--no.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
also
i
feel
that
the
third
issue
is
so
obvious
under
south
dakota
law
that
no
new
judge
is
going
to
decide
contrary
to
that
because
there
is
a
south
dakota
statute
that
says
these
specific
rights
should
be
given,
and
as
the
attorney
general
indicated,
the
new
cards
weren't
out
yet,
subsequent
to
july
1st.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that
would
be
a
correct
assumption.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
well,
you
know,
i
followed
through
on
the
appeal
with
good
faith
and
obviously
feel
that
it
is
an
issue
that
there
is--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
i
briefed
only
what
the
state
briefed
in
their
particular
brief.
i
believe
i--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--i
believe
i
did
raise
a
question
on
that
regard
in
my
reply
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that,
i
guess,
would
be
a
proper
summation
of
my
feelings
in
that
regard.
[laughter]
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
i
feel,
though,
going
to
the
constitutional
issue,
and
it
is
respondent's
position
that
schmerber,
that
this
is
clearly
communicative
or
testimonial
under
the
dictates
of
schmerber.
schmerber
specifically
states
that
blood
test
results
were
admissible
only
because
it
was
neither
petitioner's
testimony
nor
evidence
relating
to
some
communicative
act
or
writing
by
the
petitioner.
here
we
have,
through
statutory
authority,
basically
a
situation
where
the
state
has
passed
a
statute
allowing
a
compelled
testimonial
response
into
evidence.
under
the
procedures
in
south
dakota
in
arrests
such
as
this,
under
the
way
things
happen
in
a
dwi
case
such
as
this
and
the
way
it
happened
in
this
particular
case,
this
individual
is
advised
of
these
rights,
erroneously
here,
but
advised
of
these
rights,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
these
rights,
after
he
is
in
custody,
he
is
compelled
to
give
a
testimonial
response.
this
statute
now
seeks
to
introduce
into
evidence
at
a
criminal
trial
this
very
compelled
testimonial
response.
i
feel
that
it
is
clearly
communicative
and
testimonial.
i
do
not
follow
and
cannot
see
the
state's
argument
that
it
is
real
or
physical,
because
it
falls
exactly
within
the
wording,
the
outlines,
the
statements
in
schmerber
v.
california.
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
fulfilled
only
when
the
person
is
guaranteed
the
right
to
remain
silent
unless
he
chooses
to
speak
in
the
unfettered
exercise
of
his
own
will.
when
you
are
told
that
you
have
to
give
me
a
response,
you
have
to
tell
me,
that
i
want
you
to
tell
me--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
you
are
talking
testimonial,
and
as
this
court
has
indicated,
testimonial
can
be
other
than
actual
word
of
mouth;
it
can
be
a
nod
of
the
head,
a
nod
of
the
head
"no"
or
this
type
thing.
under
south
dakota
law--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--he
was
basically
requested
by
the
law
enforcement
officer
to
give
him
a
response.
that
response
was
communicative,
that
response
was
testimonial.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
he
wasn't
within
the
implied
consent
right
told
that.
but
to
follow
that
particular
question
one
step
further,
the
attorney
general's
position,
which
i
don't
necessarily
concur
with,
that
just
the
refusal,
the
fact
of
refusal
is
admissible,
under
south
dakota
law
and
under
decisions
of
the
south
dakota
supreme
court,
muteness
is
considered
a
refusal.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
muteness.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
to
stand
mute.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
yes.
to
refuse
to
speak
is
considered
a
refusal.
to
state
"i
don't
want
to
take
that
test
until
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
an
attorney.
"
under
south
dakota
law
is
considered
to
be
a
refusal.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
south
dakota
law
states
that
that
is
a
refusal.
and
under
the
attorney
general's
position,
that
just
the
fact
of
a
refusal
is
what
should
be
introduced,
if
a
person
stood
mute,
that
would
be
introduced
as
a
refusal.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
i
don't
necessarily
say
the
muteness
is
testimonial.
i
say
in
this
particular
factual
situation,
where
there
is
an
actual
verbal
response,
it
is
testimonial;
but
it
is
still
a
compelled
response.
the
muteness
is
basically
compelled
because
he
has
got
to
do
something,
either
answer
or
remain
mute,
and
it
is
going
to
be
used
against
him.
and
it
is
basically
going
into
the
private
mind
of
the
individual.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
it
is--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--if
i
said
compelled--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--yes.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
if
i
said
and
used
the
words
"compelled
refusal",
i
was
erroneous.
i
should
have
said
"compelled
response"
or
"compelled
testimony".
he
didn't
have
to
refuse,
but
whatever
he
said
was
compelled
because
he
was
being
told
at
that
particular
time.
if
he
had
acquiesced
to
the
blood
test
and
said,
"yes,
i'll
take
the
blood
test,
i'm
too
drunk,
i'll
never
pass
it,
but
i'll
take
it.
"
i
guess
i
would
consider
that
also--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
i
think
that
would
be
a
proper
assumption.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
it
is
compelled,
the
testimonial...
as
i
indicated,
it
is
not
compelled
refusal,
it
is
compelled
communicative
or
testimonial
response.
it
would
be
no
different
than
a
situation
without
the
benefits
of
miranda
where
your
fingerprints
are
being
taken,
which
is
obviously
a
legitimate
police
function,
and
the
police
officer
says,
"do
you
really
want
these
fingerprints
taken?
"
and
you
make
the
testimonial
response,
"no,
i
don't
because
they
are
probably
going
to
show
up
on
the
gun.
"
that
basically
by
the
inquisition
is
compelled
and
it
is
testimonial
under
schmerber
and
it
would
not
be
admissible.
it
would
be
what,
basically
in
the
footnote
of
schmerber
in
that
situation,
the
testimonial
by-product
that
was
discussed
there.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
as
a
defense?
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
no,
that
could
be
put
into
evidence.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
yes,
that
could
be
put
into
evidence.
but
what
i
am
stating
is
that
the
representation
by
the
attorney
general
that
all
they
wanted
was
the
refusal
into
evidence,
the
fact
of
a
refusal,
the
fact
of
the
refusal
could
mean
many
things.
i
feel,
as
i
believe
justice
stevens
referred
to
this
morning,
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
there.
if
it
is
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment,
then
and
in
that
situation
it
is
not
admissible
whether
it
is
just
called
a
refusal
or
the
actual
words
are
used.
if
it
is
not
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment,
then
i
think
the
actual
words
would
be
as
admissible
as
the
fact
of
just
a
refusal
because
the
south
dakota
statute
does
not
say
that
the
fact
of
refusal
should
be
admitted;
the
south
dakota
statute
merely
says
the
refusal
may
be
admitted.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
it
is
my
position
it
is
compelled.
the
individual
does
not
have
to
give
any
testimonial
or
communicative
response--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--that's
correct.
he
is
not
required
to
take
the
test
and
he
is
not
required...
he
has
the
option,
but
it
is
a
compelled
option
by
the
very
inquisition,
and
the
results
of
that
option
are
testimonial
or
communicative.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct.
but
you
have
a
situation
where
the
rights
used
state
that
what
do
you
want
to
do,
do
you
wish
to
take
this
test?
and
you
are
not
going
to
find
a
situation
where
someone
stands
mute
that
often,
because
it
is
an
actual
questioning,
it
is
an
actual
interrogation
compelling
this
particular
response.
and
the
basic
rights
and
problems
that
the
fifth
amendment
seeks
to
protect
and
the
dangers
in
this
type
of
situation
are
indicative
in
this
case.
not
that
there
was
any
abuse,
but
you
have
a
situation
where
he
was
advised
of
these
rights
three
times.
can
law
enforcement
officers
then
continue
to
advise
and
get
the
refusal
that
is
most
susceptible
to
what
they
would
like
to
introduce
at
trial?
under
this
statute
they
could.
and
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
compelled
response
was
not
given
only
once
but
three
times.
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
refuse,
but
there
is
not
a
constitutional
right
for
the
state
to
create
a
statute
which
compels
an
individual
to
give
testimonial
or
communicative
statements.
if
the
state's
argument
that
it
is
circumstantial
evidence
of
guilt,
if
that
argument
is
carried
to
its
logical
extreme,
then
theoretically
the
fifth
amendment
would
no
longer
protect
any
communication
that
could
also
be
characterized
as
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
state
of
mind;
and
i
submit
that
virtually
any
testimonial
or
communicative
statement
can
be
interpreted
and
argued
as
being
circumstantial
evidence
of
a
state
of
mind.
the
general
also
argues
that
this
is
necessary
to
bring
so
juries
know
what
went
on.
i
submit
that
the
only
reason
they
want
it
is
to
show
through
compelled
testimonial
response
an
inference
of
guilt.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
although
they
have
stated
here
that
their
main
concern
is
so
that
there
is
not
any
question
that
the
individual
was
not
given
the
opportunity
to
take
a
test--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--i
don't
feel
that
it
is
proper,
and
i
never
have...
and
i
have
tried
a
number
of
these...
argued,
when
the
refusal
wasn't
admitted,
argued
why
wasn't
there
a
refusal.
i
don't
feel
that
is
proper
argument
because
i
think
that
it
is
totally
improper
argument
by
a
defense
counsel.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
there
would
be
some
question
amongst
other
defense
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not
i
have
high
standards.
[laughter]
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
thank
you.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that
would
be
a
constitutional
ruling.
that
particular
statement
is
not--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--well,
the
failure
to
advise
that
the
refusal
could
be
used
against
him
was
a
violation
of
state
law,
yes.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
order--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--and
i
believe
on
page
a-32,
then,
the
actual
three
items
in
the
order
are
listed
there.
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
the
state,
i
believe,
was,
of
course,
interested
in
the
broader--
mr.
david
r.
gienapp
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
my
opinion.
