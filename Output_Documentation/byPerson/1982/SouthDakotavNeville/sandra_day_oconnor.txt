well,
didn't
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
say
in
that
regard
that
it
affirmed
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
suppressing
the
admission
of
refusal
evidence
and
that
it
need
not
address
the
other
issues
raised
on
appeal,
or
deemed
them
to
be
without
merit.
it
didn't
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
counsel,
if
it
isn't
compelled,
how
can
it
violate
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
is
not
required
to
take
the
test
and
he
is
not
required
to
answer,
is
he?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota.
a
south
dakota
statute
permits
a
person
suspected
of
driving
while
intoxicated
to
refuse
to
submit
to
a
blood
alcohol
test.
but
the
statute
authorizes
revocation
of
the
driver's
license
of
a
person
refusing
to
take
the
test.
the
statute
also
allows
evidence
of
the
refusal
to
be
used
against
the
person
at
trial.
two
police
officers
suspected
the
defendant,
neville
of
drunk
driving
and
asked
him
to
submit
to
a
blood
alcohol
test.
neville
refused
and
the
state
tried
to
introduce
evidence
of
his
refusal
at
the
trial.
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
ruled
an
introduction
of
the
evidence
would
violate
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
we
now
reverse
and
remand
because
the
officers
did
not
force
the
defendant
to
refuse
the
test,
the
defendant
has
not
been
compelled
to
testify
against
himself
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
hold
also
that
it
is
not
fundamentally
unfair
in
violation
of
due
process
to
use
the
defendant's
refusal
to
take
the
blood
alcohol
test
as
evidence
of
guilt,
even
though
the
police
failed
to
warn
him,
it
could
be
so
used.
justice
stevens
joined
by
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
