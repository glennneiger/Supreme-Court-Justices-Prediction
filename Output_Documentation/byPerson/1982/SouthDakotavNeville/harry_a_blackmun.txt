justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
statute
doesn't
require
that
he
be
informed
specifically
that
it
may
be
admitted
in
evidence.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
the
new
york
statute
does.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
it
require
that
he
be
advised
that
it
could
be
used
with
respect
to
the
revocation
or
reissuance
of
his
driver's
license?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
do
you
think
the
legislature
drew
a
distinction
between
the
two?
oversight?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
was
merely
going
to
add
that
if
he
is
acquitted,
however,
the
issue
cannot
be
reviewed.
