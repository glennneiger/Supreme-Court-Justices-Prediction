justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
attorney
general,
does
that
mean
that
the
failure
to
give
him
this
advice
would
make
the
evidence
inadmissible
no
matter
how
we
ruled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
trial
judge
ruled
it
would,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
will
happen
if
the
trial
judge
on
the
remand
says,
well,
maybe
the
statute
is
constitutional,
but
the
evidence
is
still
inadmissible
because
of
this
reason?
then
would
you
have
another
appeal
to
the
south
dakota
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
won't
determine
whether
it
is
admissible
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
mean
it
is
still
conceivable,
at
least,
that
the
trial
judge
will
say
this
evidence
is
inadmissible
for
two
reasons
that
the
united
states
has
no
business
telling
me
how
to
decide:
one,
that
it
is
not
relevant,
and
two,
you
didn't
give
the
advice
you
are
supposed
to
give
under
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
on
the
procedure.
they
also
sent
back,
as
i
remember
it,
the
question
with
the
admissibility
of
his
statement...
i'm
too
drunk
to
take
the
test...
or
he
said
something
like
that,
as
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
trial
judge
may
well
rule
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
issue.
say
he
says
again
that
that
statement
is
inadmissible.
would
you
be
able
to
ask
for
review
of
that
in
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
much
more
probative
than
the
test
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
possible...
the
reason
i
ask
these
questions
is
i
want
to
be
sure
we
have
a
final
judgment
here.
is
it
not
possible
that
on
a
second
appeal
on
that
issue
to
the
state
supreme
court,
they
might
decide
that
the
evidence
is
inadmissible
for
one
of
the
other
two
reasons,
relevance
or
failure
to
give
advice?
i
just
wonder
if
we
know
we
have
something
we
must
decide
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no,
i
understand
that.
but
they
did
also
say
that
it
was
unconstitutional
under
your
state's
constitution
as
well
as
the
federal,
too,
as
i
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
isn't
quite
true
because
there
could
be
another
appeal.
if
you
appeal
on
the
question
of
whether
"i'm
too
drunk
to
testify",
that
issue,
you
will
be
back
in
the
south
dakota
supreme
court
again
where
it
might
bring
up
all
these
issues.
that
is
a
state
case.
that
is
a
state
issue.
well,
that
is
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
i
know
in
this
case
you
are
not
arguing
about
the
conversation
"i'm
too
drunk"
because
that
has
not
been
determined
yet,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
put
in
the
fact
of
refusal,
just
as
a
matter
of
evidentiary,
you
couldn't
ask
for
the
conclusion,
did
he
refuse.
wouldn't
you
have
to
ask
what
did
the
officer
say
to
him
and
what
did
he
say?
so
wouldn't
you
necessarily
have
to
consider
whether
the
conversation
that
took
place
was
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
object
on
the
grounds
it
calls
for
a
conclusion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
made
the
objection
right
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me...
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
right
or
wrong,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
just
as
a
normal
evidentiary
matter,
that's
the
way
you
put
this
kind
of
conclusion
into
evidence,
by
putting
in
the
conversation
that
took
place.
i'm
really
not
quite
sure
why
you
are
afraid
to
argue
that
you
have
a
right
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
really
answer
the
ultimate
question
whether
you
can
put
in
the
refusal
unless
the
trial
lawyer
knows
how
he
is
going
to
go
about
doing
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
didn't
raise
those
grounds
on
their
appeal,
then
aren't
they
the
law
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
realize
that.
so
this
evidence
can
never
go
in.
in
any
event,
no
matter
what.
so
that
it
is
purely
an
advisory
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
wouldn't
answer
it.
if
they
raised
them.
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
representation
to
the
court.
you
are
telling
us
that
the
state
did
not
seek
to
reverse
those
two
rulings,
the
error
in
relying
on
the
irrelevance
that
the
trial
judge
said,
and
the
fact
that
no
advice
was
given.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
they
raised
it,
the
supreme
court
wouldn't
have
had
to
reach
them
because
they
had
another
reason
for
reversing.
then
we
would
just
decide
this
case
and
remand
it
to
the
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
refer
to
the
question
of
whether
it
was
inadmissible
because
of
irrelevance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
the
state
supreme
court
treated
both
of
those
issues
in
its
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
"i'm
too
drunk"
comment
and
the
constitutionality
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you
are
really
saying
is
you
would
be
happy
to
have
us
give
you
an
advisory
opinion
on
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
voluntariness
of
the
"i'm
too
drunk"
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no
ruling
that
the
"i'm
too
drunk"
statement
was
irrelevant.
and
there
really
couldn't
be,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
supreme
court
drew
a
distinction
between
the
refusal
and
the
"i'm
too
drunk"
statement.
they
sent
one
back
and
they
disposed
of
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
clearly
it
is
not
admissible
in
a
case
where
it's
totally
irrelevant.
it
wouldn't
be
admissible
in
a
child
custody
case,
for
example.
[laughter]
