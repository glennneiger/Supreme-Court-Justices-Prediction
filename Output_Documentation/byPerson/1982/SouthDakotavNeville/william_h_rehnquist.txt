justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
anyone
argue
that
that
burdens
your
federal
right
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
evidence
is
constitutional?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
really
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
fifth
amendment
or
sixth
amendment
or
whatever
it
is
that
would
prevent
it
from
being
offered
at
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
can't
say
that
here
so
far
as
the
south
dakota
courts
are
concerned.
all
we
can
say
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
fifth
amendment
that
prevents
them
from
being
used
by
the
south
dakota
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gienapp,
was
that
1980
amendment
that
you
just
spoke
about
in
response
to
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
were
to
prevail
on
that
basis,
the
state
would
really
be
at
quite
a
disadvantage,
wouldn't
it,
because
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota
opinion
in
this
case
seems
to
speak
only
in
terms
of
the
federal
constitution.
and
if
that
decision
were
unreviewable,
you
would
be
in
kind
of
the
same
situation
as
the
state
of
california
was
in
the
case
of
california
against
stewart.
if
it
goes
back
to
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota's
opinion,
the
state
simply
can't
use
the
evidence
and
it
will
never
have
a
chance
to
have
the
federal
question
reviewed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
there
a
suggestion
in
the
opinion
that
that
court
views
the
two
as
coterminous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
thought
we
knew
what
we
were
doing.
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
really
what
the
statute
says?
that
the
defendant
must
or
the
accused
dwi
guy
when
he
gets
out
of
the
car
must
speak
up
and
say
something?
or
just
that
if
he
doesn't
agree
to
take
the
test,
which
i
take
it
would
require
some
sort
of
consent,
the
fact
of
his
failure
to
agree
can
be
admitted
in
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
wasn't
compelled
to
shake
his
head,
certainly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
he
certainly
wasn't
compelled.
he
was
free
just
to
stand
mute,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
muteness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
what
most
cases
are
about.
isn't
the
prosecution
trying
to
show
some
sort
of
inference
of
guilt?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
anyone
who
has
tried
one
of
those
cases
knows
that
if
you
don't
put
in
the
test,
the
defense
lawyer
is
going
to
get
up
and
that
is
going
to
be
his
big
pitch
to
the
jury:
why
didn't
the
state
make
a
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
other
defense
counsel
adhere
to
your
high
standards
in
that
regard?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
always
appeal
that
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota,
making
it
clear
that
you
appeal
both
points,
and
perhaps
you
have.
