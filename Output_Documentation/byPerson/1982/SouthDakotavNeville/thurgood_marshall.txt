mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
got
a
man
that
staggers
around,
he
can't
walk
straight,
he
is
falling
all
over
the
lot,
and
he
says
"i
can't
take
the
test
because
i'm
drunk.
"
what
do
you
need
the
test
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
enough
to
convince
any
jury
that
he
is
drunk?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that,
but
i'm
just
saying
factually
then
you
wouldn't
have
had
all
this
trouble,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
killing
a
gnat
with
a
sledge
hammer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
didn't
ask
for
an
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
but
after
it
was
here,
after
it
was
granted,
you
conceded
that
the
constitutional
issue
posed
by
the
state
was
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
counsel,
i
have
a
problem.
you
ask
him
to
take
a
blood
test
and
he
stands
mute,
says
nothing.
can't
you
put
that
in
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
either
side.
put
in
evidence
the
fact
that
he
was
asked
to
take
a
blood
test
and
he
just
stood
mute
and
said
nothing.
nothing
to
stop
you
from
putting
that
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
