justice
john
paul
stevens
did
those
cases
raise
constitutional
questions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is...
is
your
view
that
the
case
turns
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
application
for
the
right
to
take
the
bar
exam,
or
would
it
be
the
same
case
if
they
had
never
applied,
and
just
made
an
attack
on
the
rule
collaterally?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
say
it
was
a
little
clearer
case
of
a
constitutional
claim
of
substance.
there
was
an
old
illinois
case,
i
know,
that
denied
admission
to
women,
and
supposing
you
had
that
kind
of
a
rule.
would
a
woman
have
to
apply
for
admission
before
she
could
bring
a
collateral
attack
on
the
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
trying
to
understand
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
is
it
your
view
that
the
jurisdiction
is
so
exclusive
that
every
attack
on
the
rule
must
be
made
by
seeking
admission
to
the
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
limit
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
you
limit
that
contention
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals?
you
wouldn't
apply
it
generally
to
state
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
probably
don't
think
it
would
be
valid
as
applied
to
state
courts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
reason
it
may
be
is
that
at
least
as
to
one
of
the
applicants,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
he
applied
for
anything
other
than
discretionary
relief
from
the
rule
as
opposed
to
a
holding
that
the
rule
was
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
he
just
asked
for
discretionary
relief,
it
might
be
just
like
a
case
where
he
had
done
nothing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
third
view,
you
wouldn't
draw
a
distinction
between
a
license
for
a
doctor,
say,
and
a
license
for
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
know,
but
he
starts
his
petition
by
saying
he
seeks
a
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
last
line
is,
for
the
foregoing
compelling
reasons,
rule
so
and
so
should
be
waived.
so
it
is
a
request
for
a
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
was
appellate
jurisdiction
in
this
court
to
review
that
determination?
say
he
had
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
after
the
denial.
could
we
have
reviewed
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
one
that...
which
one
is
page
21?
that
is
hickey.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
this
petition,
they
entered
an
order
denying
it
and
saying
we
refuse
to
waive
the
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
that
was
an
appealable
order
in
this
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt,
but
you
say
he
couldn't
bring
an
independent
proceeding
in
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
am
asking
you,
did
he
have
any
remedy
at
all?
could
he
have
direct
review
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we've
got
the
petition
in
front
of
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
you
read
the
petition,
did
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
order
denying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
answer
is
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
other
words...
i
think
i
understand
your...
your
position
is,
his
only
remedy
is
by
filing
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
and
then
direct
review
here,
and
at
his
first
opportunity
he
must
raise
all
the
questions
he
wants
to
raise,
and
then
we
could
review
them,
and
he
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
said
he
bypassed--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--all
he
did
was
ask
for
a
waiver,
and
he
is
done
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
would
be
no...
was
there
a
timeliness
requirement
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
an
adjudication
that
really
doesn't
bar
him
from
just
starting
all
over
again
wherever
he
wanted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
rather
strange
case
of
adjudication.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
has
to
raise
factual
questions
to
make
out
his
constitutional
claim?
in
other
words,
say
he
alleges
he
was
denied
because
of
his
race
or
something,
and
the
other
side
denies
it.
can
the
factual
determination
be
made
by
the
party
that
denies
the
allegations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
mean,
i
am
just
asking
you.
i
am
trying
to
get
the
structure
of
the
whole
setup.
how
would
it
work
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
kind
of
an
exhaustion
requirement.
