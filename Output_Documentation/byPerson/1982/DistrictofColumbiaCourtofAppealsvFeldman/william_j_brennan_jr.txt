mr.
rezneck,
are
there
any
areas
at
all
in
which
judgments
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
are
reviewable
other
than
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
after
that
phase-out,
judgments
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
would
be
reviewable
only
by
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
federal
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
i
say
federal
court
of
appeals
to
distinguish
that
court
from
the
local
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
the
top
court
of
the
district
judiciary.
the
district
of
columbia
requires
an
applicant
for
admission
to
the
district
of
columbia
bar
to
be
a
graduate
of
a
law
school
approved
by
the
american
bar
association.
and
neither
the
respondents
in
this
case,
who
are
applicant's
for
admission
to
the
district
of
columbia
bar,
was
graduated
from
an
approved
law
school
and
the
local
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
has
the
last
word
on
bar
admissions
in
the
district,
denied
the
respondent's
petitions
for
waiver
of
the
rule.
respondents
then
filed
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
against
the
local
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
challenging
the
denial
of
the
waivers
and
also
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
rule.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
it
lacked
subject-matter
jurisdiction.
and
the
federal
court
of
appeals
court
of
appeals
reversed
that
dismissal.
we
in
turn
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
federal
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
united
states
district
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
challenges
to
state
court
decisions
and
for
this
purpose,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
is
treated
like
a
state
court
in
particular
cases
arising
out
of
judicial
proceedings
even
if
those
challenges
alleged
that
the
state
court's
action
was
unconstitutional.
review
of
those
decisions
maybe
had
only
in
this
court.
thus,
to
the
extent
that
the
respondent
sought
review
in
the
district
court
of
the
local
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals'
denial
of
the
waivers,
they
had
no
--
the
district
court
lacked
subject-matter
jurisdiction
over
their
complaints.
but
united
states
district
courts
do
have
subject-matter
jurisdiction
over
general
challenges
to
state
bar
rules
promulgated
by
state
courts
in
nonjudicial
proceedings,
which
do
not
require
review
of
a
final
state-court
judgment
in
a
particular
case.
accordingly,
here
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
over
the
elements
of
respondents'
complaints
involving
a
general
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
district
of
columbia
rule.
the
judgment
of
the
federal
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
vacated.
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
we
have
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
justice
stevens
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
