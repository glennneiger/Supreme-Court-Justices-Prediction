mr.
michael
f.
healy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
requested
the
opportunity
to
present
a
brief
argument
this
afternoon
on
behalf
of
mr.
hickey
because
of
certain
important
distinctions
between
mr.
hickey's
case
and
that
of
mr.
feldman.
again,
since
mr.
rezneck
did
not
take
the
opportunity
to
highlight
any
of
the
facts,
let
me
take
a
few
moments
to
do
that.
after
a
distinguished,
a
long
and
distinguished
career
in
the
united
states
navy,
mr.
hickey
decided
to
retire
from
the
navy,
having
attained
the
rank
of
commander,
and
to
enter
into
a
new
profession,
the
practice
of
law.
in
march
of
1975,
he
enrolled
the
potomac
school
of
law,
a
newly
established
law
school
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
in
fact,
mr.
hickey
was
a
member
of
its
first
class.
potomac
was
not
accredited
by
the
american
bar
association.
indeed,
because
of
its
newness,
it
had
not
even
been
through
the
extensive
aba
accreditation
process.
however,
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
had
followed
a
practice
for
some
time
of
granting
waivers
from
its
requirement
that
applicants
for
the
bar
examination
be
graduates
of
an
accredited
law
school.
in
the
spring
of
1978,
mr.
hickey
applied
for
such
a
waiver.
the
petition
submitted
on
mr.
hickey's
behalf
emphasized
certain
aspects
of
his
qualifications.
it
also
emphasized
his
many
years
of
service
to
the
country.
his
navy
career
spanned
20
years.
he
received
numerous
decorations
for
valor
in
connection
with
almost
200
combat
missions
as
a
navy
fighter
pilot.
it
emphasized
his
age...
at
the
time
he
was
47
years
old...
his
family
situation,
and
the
resulting
need
to
embark
on
his
new
career
as
soon
as
possible.
what
it
did
not
emphasize
or
address
in
any
way
was
a
claim
of
a
present
right
to
admission
to
the
bar.
it
did
not
raise
any
legal
arguments.
the
d.c.
circuit
so
found.
petitioners
in
this
case
do
not
really
contest
that
fact.
instead,
what
they
claim
is
that
mr.
hickey
should
not,
and
it
is
their
words,
mr.
feldman
because
he
did
not
present
any
claims
to
the
district
court.
now,
whether
mr.
feldman
presented
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
his
act
judicial
or
not,
i
think
mr.
sussman
has
addressed
that,
and
i
don't
think
that
they
were,
but
in
mr.
hickey's
case,
there
was
no
presentation
of
any
legal
arguments.
petitioner's
contention
that
he
is
nonetheless
barred
from
federal
district
court
is
very
intriguing
in
that
light,
since
the
fundamental
basis
of
their
decision
that
the
action
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
in
mr.
feldman's
case
was
a
judicial
act
is
the
presentation
of
this
letter.
no
letter
was
submitted
in
mr.
hickey's
case.
having
said
that,
i
think
we
have
to
look
back
at
certain
fundamental
principles
of
federal
court
jurisdiction.
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
had
no
action
been
taken
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
had
mr.
hickey
gone
in
the
first
instance
to
federal
district
court,
the
federal
district
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
his
claims.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
mr.
rezneck--
mr.
michael
f.
healy
--mr.
rezneck,
when
pressed
this
afternoon,
justice
white,
did
say
that.
in
his
brief
he
says
he
doesn't
have
to
address
the
question.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
your
honor,
let
me
say
there
should
be
no
dispute.
0
[generallaughter.]
the
cases
are
very
clear,
and
we
have
cited
a
number
of
them
in
footnote
5
of
our
brief,
the
various
circuit
courts
that
have
considered--
mr.
michael
f.
healy
--your
honor,
i
think
that
contention
is
respectfully
without
merit.
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
cases
of
key
v.
doyle
or
swain
v.
pressley,
as
cited
by
mr.
rezneck,
if
one
looks
at
the
senate
report
and
the
house
of
representatives
report
in
connection
with
the
passage
of
that
act,
that
the
intention
of
the
statute
was
to
make
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
at
best
equivalent
to
the
highest
courts
of
the
various
states.
with
respect
to
the
comity
claim
that
he
also
makes,
i
don't
think
there
is
really
any
difference,
but
in
fact
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
is
still
a
creature
of
the
federal
government.
it
is
not
a
state
court.
so,
if
anything,
it
is
less
than
a
state
court.
so
i
think
that
issue
drops
out.
having
said,
and
i
think
the
cases
support
us,
that
mr.
hickey
could
have
gone
in
the
first
instance
to
district
court,
mr.
rezneck
still
argues
that
the
summers
case
applies.
again,
the
fact
that
mr.
hickey
never
raised
his
constitutional
claims
takes
us
out
of
the
summers
case
entirely.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
your
honor,
you
might
have
a
question
of
standing
at
that
point,
and
in
fact
in
the
district
court
counsel
for
petitioners
argued
that
because
we
had
not
made
a
formal
application
after
having
been
denied
the
waiver,
that
we
didn't
have
standing.
judge
greene
thought
that
there
wasn't
any
merit
to
that
argument.
clearly,
we
have
the
requisite
constitutional
standing
by
having
made
the
petition
for
a
waiver.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
we
had...
as
the
d.c.
circuit
found,
mr.
hickey
in
his
petition
acknowledged
that
the
rule
applied
to
him,
and
would
on
its
face
have
barred
him
from
sitting
for
the
bar
examination.
he
sought
a
waiver.
when
that
waiver
was
denied,
then
the
requisite
standing...
he
had
been
denied
admission
to
the
bar.
that
is
correct.
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
not
a
claim
of
right
to
admission
to
the
bar.
there
may
be
a
point
in
time
that
one
must
do
something
in
order
to
gain
the
requisite
standing
in
order
to
have
one's
federal
claim,
but
the
question
addressed
in
the
summers
case
was
whether
the
applicant
there,
as
he
had,
had
raised
his
fourteenth
amendment
claims
in
an
adjudication
by
the
state
court.
therefore,
having
claimed
a
present
right
to
the
bar,
and
having
litigated
federal
questions,
therefore,
this
court's
power
to
review
on
certiorari
had
attached.
if
there
is
no
claim
of
right--
mr.
michael
f.
healy
--it
says
that
a
petition
for
waiver
will
not
be
granted.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
were
denied
admission
to
sit
for
the
bar
examination.
however,
that
is
not
an
adjudication--
mr.
michael
f.
healy
--justice
o'connor,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
a
difference
between
judicial
power
and
a
judicial
act.
i
would
not
dispute
the
fact
that
the
general
administration
of
the
bar
is
something
that
has
been
given
to
the
courts
to
administer
in
all
of
the
states,
but
what
the
other
courts
that
have
considered
it
since
that
time
and
what
the
supreme
court
has
said
in
summers
and
as
the
seventh
circuit
said
in
ktsanes,
what
you
have
to
decide
is
whether
the
judicial
power
has
been
exercised
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
rise
to
a
case
or
controversy
which
then
becomes
something
that
can
be
reviewed
in
this
court
if
federal
jurisdictional
questions
are
raised.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
yes,
your
honor,
it
did,
and
what
we
then
did
in
federal
district
court
was
to
contend
that
the
rules
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face
and
as
applied.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
in
the
state
court
situation?
mr.
michael
f.
healy
the
ktsanes
court,
the
seventh
circuit
decision...
it
is
k-t-s-a-n-e-s...
said
that
an
application
for
a
waiver
from
the
court's
rules
does
not
become
a
judicial
act
within
the
meaning
of
summers,
and
that
one
has
the
right
subsequently
to
go
to
federal
court.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
yes,
sir.
if
the
highest
court
of
a
state
rules,
having
been
presented
with
claims
against
one,
one
must
take
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
in
this
case,
we
did
not
submit
any
federal
questions...
we
did
not
submit
any
state
law
questions
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
if
one
submits
purely
a
state
law
question,
one
could
still
go
to
federal
court.
if
one
simply
asked
for
a
waiver,
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
a
ruling
by
the
state
court
and
in
judicial
capacity.
mr.
michael
f.
healy
it
is
merely
an
administrative
act
denying
a
request
for
a
waiver.
finally--
mr.
michael
f.
healy
--thank
you,
sir.
