justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rezneck,
do
you
think
your
case
stands
on
any
different
footing
than
if
you
were
representing
the
highest
court
of
a
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
respect
does
it
stand
on
a
different
footing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rezneck,
it
seems
to
me
i
have
seen
perhaps
in
some
new
york
proceedings,
if
someone
is
dissatisfied
with
what
might
be
classified
as
an
administrative
action
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
they
apparently
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york,
which
is
obviously
subsidiary
to
the
court
of
appeals.
would
there
have
been
any
possibility
of
initiating...
of
either
of
these
respondents
initiating
action
in
the
superior
court
of
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
is
that
statute
that
confides
the
jurisdiction
or
the
responsibility
for
admission
to
the
bar
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
that
you
rely
on
to
say
that
the...
that
court
of
appeals
is
in
a
different
position
here
than
the
highest
court
of
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
rezneck,
what
if
i
went
before
the...
or
what
if
my
wife,
assuming
she
were
admitted
to
the
bar,
went
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
applied
for
admission
to
that
court,
saying
that
she
was
admitted
to
practice
in
the
state
of
arizona,
the
district
of
arizona,
and
the
ninth
circuit
says,
no,
we
don't
admit
women
to
practice
here?
is
there
any
review
that
she
could
have
of
that
ruling?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
that
would
be
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
within
our
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
assume
it
would
be,
and
i
assume
that
respondents
here
are
claiming
that
there
was
a
clear
constitutional
violation,
and
your
answer
isn't
that
there
wasn't
a
violation,
but
that
whatever
the
case
with
respect
to
that
may
be,
there
is
no
remedy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
really
a
different
claim
that
you
presented
to
the
united
states
district
court
than
was
presented
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
shouldn't
you
at
least
have
gone
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
with
your
constitutional
claim
as
a
matter
of
exhaustion
before
you
went
to
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
those
1983
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
authority
do
you
have
other
than
1983
claims
that
there
is
no
principle
of
exhaustion
available
here?
i
think
your
colleague
wants
to
call
your
attention
to
something.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
even
if
the
decision-maker
is
the
highest
court
of
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hasn't
the
reason
for
saying
on
occasion
that
you
don't
have
to
raise
constitutional
issues
before
an
administrative
tribunal
is
that
typically
such
a
tribunal
may
be
made
up
of
an
engineer
and
a
doctor
and
an
architect,
who
probably
don't
have
too
much
expertise
in
constitutional
questions,
but
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
apply
where
the
administrator
is
a
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
one
likes
to
sue
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that
is
true.
anything
that
was
litigated
or
might
have
been
litigated
is
barred.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
mr.
hickey
had
gone
in
the
first
instance
to
the
district
court
without
ever
having
gone
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
what
would
his
constitutional
claim
be
if
he
had
never
made
application
to
be
admitted
to
the
district
of
columbia
bar?
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
waiver,
but
he
had
a
hunch
that
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
wouldn't
give
it
to
him?
do
you
think
the
federal
court
would
really
pass
judgment
on
that
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
i
understood
mr.
sussman,
he
said
that
he
stated
their
constitutional
positions
but
he
didn't
really
tender
them.
