counsel,
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
a
waiver?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
else
could
you
get
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
you
get
to
any
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
did,
didn't
you,
petition
and
ask
them
to
waive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
right
did
you
have
to
ask
them
for
a
waiver?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
that
had
been
by
a
state
court,
you
would
have
had
a
right
to
go
into
the
federal
district
court.
that
is
your
theory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
where
is
that
case?
the
citation
of
that
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
highest
court
of
the
state
rules
against
you,
and
that
gives
you
a
right
of
action
in
the
district
court
of
that
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
waiver
or
anything.
my
question
was,
if
the
highest
court
of
the
state
rules
against
you
on
anything,
where
do
you
get
the
right
to
appeal
that
to
a
united
states
district
court?
that
is
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
apply
that
to
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
i
say
state
or
federal
questions
in
my
hypothetical?
i
didn't
say
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
it?
