mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
these
two
cases
are
here
on
a
single
issue,
whether
the
federal
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
have
jurisdiction
to
review
prior
decisions
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
denying
applications
to
the
d.c.
bar
or
the
d.c.
bar
examination
by
particular
applicants.
rather
than
burdening
the
court
with
a
recital
of
the
facts
of
these
cases,
which
are
fully
set
out
in
the
brief,
i
thought
it
would
be
useful
if
i
outlined
at
the
outset
the
routes
by
which
an
applicant
may
obtain
admission
to
the
d.c.
bar
as
they
bear
on
these
cases.
there
are
three
possible
routes.
one
is
graduation
from
an
aba;approved
law
school
and
success
on
the
d.c.
bar
examination,
and
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
neither
of
these
applicants
met
that
standard.
that
particular--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--neither
took
the
bar
examination,
and
neither
was
a
graduate
of
an
aba
approved
law
school.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
on
the
circumstances
presented
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
each
one
was
not
permitted
to
take
the
d.c.
bar
examination.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
that
requirement
of
graduation
from
an
aba
approved
law
school
prevails
in
most
jurisdictions
in
the
united
states.
its
validity
has
never
been
undermined
by
any
court,
to
my
knowledge,
and
when
an
effort
was
made
to
challenge
it
here
several
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
the
challenge
did
not
present
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
second
route
for
admission
to
the
d.c.
bar
is
admission
on
motion
of
a
person
who
is
a
member
of
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
of
any
other
state
or
territory,
and
who
has
been
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law
for
five
of
the
eight
years
preceding
the
application.
this
is
subsection
(c)
of
the
court's
rule
46
that
we
have
been
dealing
with.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
teaching
at
an
aba
approved
law
school
qualifies
under
this
rule
as
being
engaged
in
the
practice
of
law,
and
mr.
feldman,
as
his
brief
indicates,
has
been
doing
that
for
some
period
of
time
at
rutgers
camden,
which
is
an
aba
approved
law
school.
in
other
words,
mr.
feldman
can
be
admitted
on
motion
to
the
d.c.
bar
after
the
specified
time
period.
he
is
not
forever
barred
from
the
d.c.
bar
by
the
fact
that
he
did
not
graduate
from
an
aba
approved
law
school.
the
third
route
is
that
a
person
who
is
a
graduate
of
an
unaccredited
law
school
is
eligible
to
take
the
d.c.
bar
examination
upon
completion
of
24
credit
hours
in
an
aba
approved
school.
this
is
the
so-called
24-hour
rule,
which
is
involved
in
mr.
hickey's
case.
there
are
six
aba
accredited
law
schools
in
the
district
of
columbia.
there
are
two
in
mr.
hickey's
home
state
of
maryland.
there
are
172
in
the
united
states
as
a
whole,
and
24
credit
hours
at
any
one
of
them
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
court's
24-hour
rule,
and
mr.
hickey
is
still
entirely
eligible
to
do
that.
thus,
there
are
several
different
routes
into
the
d.c.
bar.
the
one
route
which
we
submit
is
not
available
is
for
a
frustrated
bar
applicant
to
go
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
obtain
a
coercive
order
against
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
nullifying
a
prior
decision
of
that
court,
and
requiring
it
to
abandon
its
own
rules
for
admission,
and
that
is
what
both
the
respondents
have
attempted
to
do
here.
i
would
like
to
identify
for
the
court
several
important
interests
which
we
regard
as
being
at
stake
in
this
case.
first,
and
i
suppose
most
obvious,
is
the
interest
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
in
maintaining
its
independence
and
its
authority
in
a
matter
which
has
been
expressly
confided
to
it
by
congress,
admission
to
its
bar,
and
the
governing
statute
here,
i
think,
is
about
as
explicit
as
it
could
be.
this
is
section
2501
of
title
xi
of
the
d.c.
code:
"the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
shall
make
such
rules
as
it
deems
proper
respecting
the
examination,
qualification,
and
admission
of
persons
to
membership
in
its
bar.
"
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
are
not
talking
here
about
admission
to
the
bar
of
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia,
which
are
entirely
free
to
regulate
their
own
bars
as
they
see
fit,
and
they
do
so.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
i
do,
because
of
the
court
reorganization
act,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that
considering
the
history
of
regulation
of
the
bar
in
the
district,
which
was
originally
confided
to
the
u.s.
district
court
as
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
you
had
a
considered
judgment
by
congress
expressed
in
that
statute
transferring
that
jurisdiction
to
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
as
the
highest
court
of
the
district
of
columbia.
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
what
implications
can
fairly
be
drawn
from
that
transfer
of
jurisdiction.
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
precedent
in
this
court
under
the
court
reorganization
act,
specifically
the
swain
versus
pressley
decision
by
justice
stevens
on
behalf
of
the
court
several
years
ago,
which
construed
a
different
provision
of
the
court
reorganization
act
as
conferring
less
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
district
court
here
than
would
be
true
on
federal
district
courts
elsewhere
in
the
country
because
of
the
provisions
and
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
court
reorganization
act.
so,
i
do
think
that
we
stand
on
a
different
and
on
a
stronger
footing
here
in
the
district
for
an
absence
of
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
then
it
is
a
state.
it
would
depend,
of
course,
as
to
whether
the
act
of
congress
had
anything
to
say
about
control
over
admission
to
the
bar.
normally
that
would
not
be
the
case
when
a
state
is
admitted.
here
we
do
have
a
statute
which
deals
explicitly
with
the
subject
of
control
of
admission
to
the
bar,
and
of
course
there
isn't
any
congressional
statute
applicable
anywhere
else
in
the
united
states
except
in
the
district
of
columbia.
so
that
we
have
that
statute
to
interpret
and
apply
here,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
prior
history
in
the
district
of
columbia
of
regulation
of
the
bar.
as
i
was
indicating,
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
is
not
in
any
sense
attempting
to
control
the
bars
of
other
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
feldman,
for
example,
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit.
his
name
appears
on
briefs
in
cases
in
that
court,
and
in
the
reports
of
decisions
in
cases
in
that
court.
while
he
was
in
washington,
he
was
eligible
to
practice
in
the
federal
district
court
here,
because
he
was
associated
with
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
federal
district
court.
in
other
words,
we
are
concerned
solely
here
with
admission
to
the
local
bar,
and
that
is
the
right
to
practice
in
the
local
court
system
and
to
hold
oneself
out
as
admitted
to
the
general
practice
of
law
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
overturns
or
undermines
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
court
reorganization
act
of
1970,
which
was
the
transfer
of
jurisdiction
over
the
local
bar
from
the
federal
court
to
the
u.s....
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
and
i
would
suggest
that
a
few
lines
of
the
history
here
are
instructive,
because
as
i
think
this
court
knows
from
its
prior
decisions
under
the
court
reorganization
act,
and
as
i
certainly
well
remember
when
i
came
to
washington
to
practice
20
years
ago,
we
had
this
unique
hybrid
court
system
here,
where
you
had
a
federal
court
system
that
was
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
not
limited
jurisdiction,
you
had
a
local
court
system
that
was
entirely
subordinated
to
the
federal
court
system,
and
you
had
a
local
bar
which
was
under
the
control
of
the
u.s.
district
court.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
it
was...
well--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--the
superior
court
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
municipal
court
was
certainly
not.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
there
was
separate
admission
to
the
municipal
court
bar.
if
one
was
a
member
of
the--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--no.
if
one
was
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
u.s.
district
court,
one
was
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
municipal
court,
and
i
believe
also
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
as
it
then
was,
so
that
you
had
really
a
mirror
image
situation
of
what
prevails
now.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
same
situation
prevailed,
because
that
was
prior
to
court
reorganization.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
the
superior
court,
and
it
was
then
that
the
superior
court
became
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction.
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
became
the
highest
court--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--correct.
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
became
the
highest
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
and
both
federal
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
were
reduced
to
the
status
of
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction,
like
other
lower
federal
courts
in
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that
there
may
be
one
provision
in
the
court
reorganization
act
that
deals
with
certain
types
of
criminal
cases
where
you
have
a
joinder
of
d.c.
code
and
u.s.
code
offenses
in
the
local
court
system.
i
think
there
is
some
provision
which
may
still
exist
for
review
of
such
cases
by
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals,
although
that
may
be
part
of
the
phase-out.
there
was
some
transitional
reviewing
jurisdiction
even
after
the
court
reorganization
that
existed
for
some
years,
but--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--only
by
this
court.
that's
correct.
and
that
was
a
key
provision
of
the
court
reorganization
act,
that
decisions
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
were
made
directly
reviewable
here
instead
of
in
the
lower
federal
courts
as
they
had
been
previously,
and
the
independence
and
control
over
the
d.c.
bar
which
was
confided
by
congress
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
had
been
scrupulously
respected
by
the
federal
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
present
case.
there
has
been
an
unbroken
line
of
cases
in
the
federal
district
court
which
had
dismissed
suits
by
frustrated
bar
applicants
as
not
being
the
business
of
the
federal
district
court
in
washington.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
some
did.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
they
had
gone
into
the
district
court
originally,
in
the
first
instance?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
you
don't,
of
course,
have
to
reach
that
question
here,
because
of
the
case--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
if
we
were
pressed
to
take
a
position
on
that
because
the
facts
required
it,
i
think
our
position
would
be
that
the
will
of
congress
is
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
bar
admission
should
be--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
because
there
is
no
act
of
congress
that
would
govern
in
such
situations.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
haven't
had
to
face
that
question,
and
of
course
it
is
not
necessary
to
face
the
question
that
you
put
in
these
cases,
because--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--i
think--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--i
think
that
there
are
three...
i
have
thought
about
this,
and
i
think
that
there
are
three
possible
approaches
that
could
be
taken,
and
there
are
authorities,
i
think,
that
support
each
of
them.
they
all
lead
to
the
same
result
here.
i
think
one
could
conclude
that
on
the
basis
of
the
court
reorganization
act,
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
from
start
to
finish
is
confided
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
there
is
an
intermediate
position,
which
is
that
where
applicants
have
gone
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
or,
for
that
matter,
to
a
state
court
in
the
states,
and
have
obtained
an
adverse
decision
from
the
state
court
or
in
this
case
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
that
they
cannot
then
go
into
the
federal
district
court
to
seek
review
or
to
relitigate
any
issues
that
were
before
the
local
court.
and
i
think
there
is
a
third
position,
which
i
know
finds
support
in
a
decision
by
judge
marrage
and
in
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
the
woodard
case
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
which
is
that
bar
admissions
matters
are
of
such
paramount
importance
to
the
states
that
whether
it
is
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
states,
they
belong
in
the
state
court
system
from
start
to
finish,
subject...
and
i
always
emphasize
subject...
to
final
review
in
this
court.
so,
under
any
of
those
views,
of
course,
these
cases
would
be
decided
exactly
the
same
way,
in
favor
of
dismissal
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
not
under
that
third
view.
that
is
probably
the
broadest
approach.
it
certainly
isn't
necessary
to
the
decision
of
this
case,
but
there
is
very
respectable
authority
in
the
fourth
circuit,
and
i
think
also
in
the
ninth
circuit,
taking
that...
taking
that
point
of
view.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
really
an
accurate
summation
of
what
happened
here,
because
i
know
that
the
respondents
here
have
attempted
to
avoid
the
effect
of
the
summers
case--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--by
asserting
that
all
that
they
were
doing
was
asking
for
a
waiver,
and
that
they
were
not
in
any
sense
making
a
so-called
claim
of
right
which
would
create
a
justiciable
controversy
and
lead
to
a
judicial
determination.
i
would
point
out
that
if
you
read
their
petition
carefully,
that
you
will
see
that
each
respondent
was
asserting
in
his
petition
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
that
he
was
qualified
to
practice
law
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
he
was
qualified
for
admission
to
the
d.c.
bar,
or
at
least
to
take
the
d.c.
bar
examination,
by
reason
of
the
unique
circumstances
of
his
particular
case.
in
fact,
they
necessarily
had
to
assert,
and
they
did
in
fact
assert
that
they
were
qualified
to
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia
because
that
was
a
predicate
for
them
to
be
eligible
for
a
waiver.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
claim
of
right
on
which
the
court
was
capable
of
taking
judicial
action.
i
would
like
in
that
connection
just
to
refer
to
a
couple
of
points
in
the
record
on
that.
let's
take,
for
example,
petitioner
mr.
hickey
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
this
is
at
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix.
his
first
point:
"petitioner
is
substantively
qualified
to
sit
for
the
bar
examination.
"
in
other
words,
he
was
asserting--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--that
is
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
right,
20a.
that
is
the
hickey
petition.
"petitioner
is
substantively
qualified
to
sit
for
the
bar
examination.
"
that
was
a
predicate
to
his
request
for
a
waiver,
that
he
met
the
qualifications,
other
than
in
the
one
respect
of
not
having
graduated
from
an
aba
law
school.
his
counsel,
and
i
emphasize
that
both
these
litigants
were
represented
by
distinguished
law
firms,
and
it
seems
to
me
unrealistic
to
say
that
what
has
happened
here
was
somehow
a
trap
for
the
unwary,
which
is
the
phrase
that
they
have
used.
at
page
24
of
mr.
hickey's
petition,
his
counsel
stated,
after
reviewing
the
unique
circumstances
of
his
case,
"far
more
than
most,
this
man
has
earned
the
right
to
sit
for
the
bar
examination.
"
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--he
does,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
terminology...
i
don't
think
that
the
terminology
of
a
request
for
a
waiver
can
be
determinative
of
the
question
whether
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
made
a
judicial
determination
in
his
case.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
this
is
simply
a
pleading
matter.
there
have
been
numerous
cases
in
the
circuits
in
which
people
asked
for
exceptions,
for
exemptions.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
are
you
speaking
of
the
hickey
case
specifically?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that's
the
hickey
petition.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
right.
i
understand
that
there
may
be
different...
somewhat
different
considerations
as
between
the
two
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
think
that
the
question
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
over
that
kind
of
decision
is,
i
think,
unsettled
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
court
would
have
constitutional...
article
iii
jurisdiction
to
review
it,
because
it
is
a
matter
which
arises
in
the
district
of
columbia,
where
all
law
is
federal,
and
i
think
that
you
will
find
in
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
the
pernall
case--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that
he
could
if
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
he
explicitly
had
not
raised
federal
constitutional
questions,
assuming
that
that--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--right.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
there
is
a
question
on
the
petition
as
written
as
to
whether
there
would
be
statutory
jurisdiction
under
1257.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
an
unsettled
question.
i
really
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
there
would
clearly
be
constitutional
jurisdiction,
because
it
is
a
federal
matter,
by
virtue
of
arising
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
think,
if
i
may
try
to
be
responsive
to
your
point,
because
i
understand
what
you
are
seeking
here,
that
he
could
have
raised,
whether
he
did
so
explicitly
or
not,
he
could
have
raised
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
either
in
that
petition
or
on
a
petition
for
reconsideration
following
the
denial
of
his
waiver,
any
and
all
federal
constitutional
questions
which
he
later
asserted
in
his
suit
in
the
district
court,
and
i
would
suggest
that
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
of
a
bypass
of
available
remedies.
that
is
one
way
to
characterize
it.
or
a
splitting
of
claims.
that
is
another
way
to
characterize
it.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
be
his
first
opportunity,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
he
could
have--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--he
could
have
gone...
he
could
have
gone
back
and
raised
any
and
all
federal
constitutional
or
statutory
questions
by
way
of
petition
for
reconsideration
after
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
imposing
an
unreasonable
burden
on
him
if
the
alternative
is
to
inject
the
federal
court
system
and
to
review--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--no.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
that
is...
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
we
have
taken
the
position
in
the
district
court--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--we
took
the
position
in
the
district
court,
your
honor,
that
if
mr.
hickey
wants
to
renew
this
process
and
apply
for
a
waiver
and
raise
any
and
all
of
those
questions
now,
he
is
free
to
do
that
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
now
and
the
court
will
hear
him.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
one...
i
suppose
one
could
presuppose
or
postulate
that
you
could...
you
could
have
formulated
an
action
perhaps
against
the
admissions
committee
in
the
superior
court.
i
think
under
the
statutory
framework
here,
where
jurisdiction
over
the
bar
is
so
clearly
confided
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
that
from
a
procedural
standpoint,
these
petitioners
proceeded
correctly,
which
was
to
file
a
petition
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
as
an
original
matter.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
rely
on
it
as
making
a
congressional
allocation
of
jurisdiction
between
local
and
federal
courts
which
has
no
counterpart
in
any
federal
statute
applying
elsewhere
in
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
would...
that
is
correct.
i
would
be
arguing
for
the
same
result,
because
there
is
a
long
line
of
cases
in
the
circuit
and
district
courts
holding
that
a
bar
applicant
who
goes
to
the
state
court
system
first
cannot
thereafter
seek,
in
effect,
collateral
review
of
the
state
court
decision
by
going
to
the
federal
courts.
that
is
a
line
of
authority
which
is
summarized
by
the
tenth
circuit
in
a
case
called
doe
versus
pringle.
we
would
certainly
make
that
argument
if
this
case
arose
in
new
jersey.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
there
is
a
lot
of
language
in
these
cases,
and
i
may
say,
if
i
might
speak
to
that
point,
that...
because
i
think
it
does
give
some
additional
strength
here
to
the
idea
that
it
is
entirely
rational
to
construe
the
congressional
purpose
here
as
conferring
this
jurisdiction
exclusively
on
the
court,
on
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
judges
who,
although
article
i
judges,
admittedly,
are
nevertheless
nominated
by
the
president,
are
confirmed
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states,
are
used
to
dealing
with
questions
of
federal
constitutional
and
statutory
law
as
their
daily
staple.
this
is
a
court
which
has
shown
itself
over
the
years
since
it
was
made
the
highest
court
of
the
district
to
be
fully
receptive
and
congenial
to
claims
of
federal
constitutional
law.
this,
almost
above
all
courts,
i
suppose,
in
addition
to
the
federal
court
system,
is
a
court
which
can
properly
be
entrusted
with
the
determination
of
federal
constitutional
or
other
questions,
subject
to
ultimate
review
by
this
court.
in
other
words--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--if
the...
if
that
was
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit?
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
i
would
think
she
would
have
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
that
would,
it
seems
to
me,
be
a
clear
constitutional
violation
by
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
no,
i
think
that...
the
case
that
you
put
is
really
an...
is
in
the
sense
that
you
have
the
judicial
determination
by
the
ninth
circuit
acting
in
a
judicial
capacity
which
would
be
reviewable
in
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari,
just
as
here
it
is
our
position
that
you
had
a
judicial
determination
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
acting
in
a
judicial
capacity
which
was
reviewable
by
this
court,
but
not
in
a
lower
federal
district
court.
so,
i
don't
see
any
conflict
or
divergence
between
the
two
cases.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
you
are
speaking
on
review
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
again,
i
think
that
really
goes
to
a
question
which
has
not
ever
been
settled
in
the
district
of
columbia,
because
as
justice
marshall's
opinion
which
i
referred
to
in
pernall--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
it
may
be
reviewable
as
a
decision
on
federal
law,
all
of
which
decisions
are
ultimately
reviewable
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
yes,
it--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--if
in
fact
he
didn't
raise
them,
that
would
pose
a
question,
but
he
pleaded
the
facts
which
would
support
the
very
constitutional
claim
that
he
articulated
as
a
constitutional
claim
when
he
got
to
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
my
point
would
be
that
with
respect
to
the
question
here,
which
is
the
allocation
of
jurisdiction
between
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
and
the
federal
district
court,
that
if
he
could
have
raised
those
questions--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
and
obtained
a
full
and
fair
hearing
of
them,
and
there
is
no
contention
to
the
contrary--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--that
he
cannot
go
to
the
federal
district
court
under
the
scheme
that
is
in
effect
in
the
district
of
columbia.
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
point,
but
if
forced
to
it,
that
would
also
be
our
position.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
but
i
emphasize
that
he
is
entirely
free
to
seek
to
raise
those
questions
now
if
he
chooses
to
do
so,
assuming
he
did
not
do
so
before,
and
of
course
i
am
only
referring
to
mr.
hickey
in
this
regard.
there
is
no
question,
i
think,
on
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
that
mr.
feldman
raised
those
federal
constitutional
questions
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
well,
of
course,
we
don't
have
anything
like
that
here.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the
state
court
system,
at
least
in
the
first
instance,
subject
to
review
by
this
court,
would
provide
the
factfinding
mechanism
by
which
such
a
question
would
be
adjudicated.
now,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
if
you
could
demonstrate
that
that
mechanism
was
inadequate,
just
as
in
other
contexts,
and
didn't
provide
a
fair
and
adequate
remedy
in
the
state
court
system,
that
would
provide
a
basis
for
going
to
the
federal
courts.
i
think
that
is
true
in
habeas
corpus,
and
it
is
true
in
a
number
of
other
contexts.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
we
are
not
disputing
that
proposition
at
all,
but
again,
that
doesn't
arise
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
let
me
just
respond
very
briefly
to
a
couple
of
points.
mr.
feldman's
counsel
has
asserted
that
he
did
not
raise
federal
constitutional
questions
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
record
clearly
is
contrary
to
that.
if
one
examines
his
letter
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
which
is
at
pages
6
to
15
of
the
joint
appendix,
one
will
see--
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
--six
to
15.
one
will
see
such
questions,
for
example,
this
court
must
give
him
some
opportunity
to
show
that
his
unique
training
and
experience
have
provided
him
with
adequate
qualifications
to
practice
law.
a
flat
rejection
of
mr.
feldman's
application
without
according
him
that
opportunity
would
represent
the
very
kind
of
irrebuttable
presumption
that
the
supreme
court
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
have
expressly
condemned.
the
district
court
found
explicitly
that
he
did
more
than
seek
a
rule
46
waiver.
he
in
fact
raised
constitutional
and
statutory
issues
before
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
a.
rezneck
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
his
own
complaint,
which
i
think
may
be
the
best
evidence
on
this,
his
own
complaint
in
the
district
court,
page
41,
and
he
is
describing
the
proceedings
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
and
he
says,
"finally,
counsel
argued
that
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
rule
46
violated
both
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
federal
antitrust
laws
insofar
as
it
conclusively
denied
admission
to
the
bar
to
all
persons
except
graduates
of
an
aba
accredited
law
school.
"
i
think
the
record
is
clear
here
that
he
did
raise
those
questions,
that
he
certainly
could
have
taken
them
to
this
court
on
certiorari
from
the
decision
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
he
did
not
do
so.
he
sought
a
bypass
or
a
short
circuit
by
going
to
a
federal
district
court.
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
permissible.
with
respect
to
mr.
hickey
in
that
regard,
while
mr.
hickey
did
not
articulate
his
claims
in
the
same
way,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
his
petition
will
show
that
mr.
hickey
claimed
before
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
that
he
was
qualified
to
take
the
d.c.
bar
exam.
judge
robb,
who
dissented
in
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals,
said
that
he
could
see
no
difference
in
constitutional
principle
between
a
claim
of
right
of
admission
to
the
bar
and
a
claim
of
right
to
take
the
bar
exam,
and
that
each
tendered
an
issue
before
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
which
was
reviewable
here,
and
was
not
brought
here.
i
just
wanted
to
comment
in
conclusion
on
the
point
raised
by
justice
o'connor.
if
this
court
should
find
that
the
decision
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
in
each
of
these
cases
was
a
judicial
determination,
which
we
submit
it
was,
what
the
result
should
be.
we
submit
that
the
result
should
be
a
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
and
a
reinstatement
of
the
judgments
of
dismissal
of
the
district
court.
that
is
so
for
two
reasons.
it
would
be
an
effort
to
relitigate
in
the
district
court
a
judicial
determination
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
and
there
is
clearly
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
to
do
that
under
a
long
line
of
cases,
and
alternatively,
it
would
be
res
judicata
either
on
the
theory
that
the
same
facts
and
theories
in
essence
were
pleaded
in
both
courts,
or
alternatively,
that
all
theories
could
have
been
pleaded
in
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
and
were
not
and
are
still
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
so,
either
way
you
go
on
that
question,
once
you
conclude
it
is
a
judicial
determination,
i
submit
that
the
result
here
should
be
a
dismissal
of
both
cases,
which
is
what
both
district
court
judges
found
should
be
done.
thank
you.
