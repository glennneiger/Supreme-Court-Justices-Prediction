justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
some
suggestion,
at
least,
that
feldman
raised
his
constitutional
issue
with
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
now
have
a
problem,
i
suppose,
of
splitting
a
cause
of
action,
possibly,
and
neither
of
the
federal
courts
ruled
on
that
issue,
did
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
your
filing
was
judicial
in
character
initially,
then
presumably
we
would
be
faced
with
what
to
do
with
the
splitting
of
the
cause
of
action
or
the
res
judicata
problem.
would
we
then
have
to
remand
on
that,
or
should
we,
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
should
that
be
remanded,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ex
parte
garland
says
that
it
is
a
judicial
action,
doesn't
it,
the
exclusion
of
attorneys
from
the
bar
is
an
exercise
of
judicial
power.
