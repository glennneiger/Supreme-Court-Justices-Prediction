we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
and
others
against
feldman
and
hickey.
mr.
rezneck,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
neither
of
them?
did
they
ever
get
to
the
second
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
they
were,
as
i
understood,
the
problem
is
that
they
were
barred
from
taking
the
examination.
that
is
the
issue,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
suppose
before
alaska
was
admitted
to
the
union
it
had
the
same
kind
of
a
problem.
once
it
was
admitted...
that
is,
the
federal
courts,
territorial
judges
performing
certain
functions.
once
it
was
admitted
to
the
union,
it
comes
in
on
an
equal
footing
with
all
other
states,
and
also
with
equal
burdens,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
those
days,
mr.
rezneck,
there
was
a
municipal
court
which
is
somewhat
like
the
superior
court
now.
is
that
correct?
somewhat.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhat.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
performed
functions
somewhat
like,
but
broader.
now,
in
those
days,
what
was
the
situation
on
practicing
before
the
municipal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
have
to
take
an
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
when
the
municipal
court
later
became
the
court
of
general
sessions,
did
the
same
practice
prevail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
it
went
from
the
court
of
general
sessions
to--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--like
any
other...
like
any
other
state
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
mr.
rezneck.
i
don't--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--oh,
in
the
joint
appendix.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
were
representing
the
state
of
new
jersey
in
the
same
set
of
facts,
would
you
be
making
different
arguments,
except
that
you
think
you
have
an
additional
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
case
in
which
there
is
some
suggestion
that
there
is
the
risk
that
the
federal
courts
would
become
superboards
of
law
examiners?
one
of
the
cases
has
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
sussman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
all
jurisdictions
have
the
same
patterns?
if
virginia
elects
to
allow
private
study
as
a
predicate
for
taking
the
bar,
does
that
mean
other
states
must
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
need
not
spend
your
time
establishing
that
there
are
other
ways
to
learn
the
law.
roscoe
pound,
i
think,
did
not
go
to
a
law
school
in
the
conventional
way,
and
neither
did
justice
jackson
fully,
but
that
isn't
the
issue
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
now
that
you
are
here,
are
you
in
the
position
of
saying
that
this
court
sits
to
review
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
51
or
two
or
three,
depending
on
how
you
count
puerto
rico--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
that
the
rule,
whatever
the
rule
is,
should
be
the
same
for
a
jurisdiction
which
would
not
permit
a
person
to
sit
for
examinations
to
be...
to
practice
medicine
unless
they
had
graduated
from
a
school,
a
medical
school
accredited
by
the
american
medical
association
or
some
other
such
body?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
healy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rezneck,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
six?
