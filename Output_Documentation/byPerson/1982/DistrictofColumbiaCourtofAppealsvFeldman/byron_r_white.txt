justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
do
you
say
about
the,
again,
on
the
waiver,
that
this
is
just
a...
i
know
your
rule,
but
please
waive
it?
that
is
all
that
happened
here,
in
one
case,
at
least.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
wouldn't...
if
the
constitutional
issues
weren't
raised,
we
normally
wouldn't
review
those
issues.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
he
could
have
raised
them,
and
i
know
your
position
is
that
whether
he
raised
them
or
not,
the
federal
court
has
no
role
in
this
matter
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
until
he
does
raise
those
issues,
at
least
some
federal
issue,
some
federal...
is
the
decision
reviewable
here,
other
than...
just
other
than
the
refusal
to
waive?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't
include
constitutional
issues.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
didn't
raise
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
normally
require
something
more
than
a
record
that...
on
the
basis
of
which
a
constitutional
issue
could
have
been
raised.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
he
could
never
go
to
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
couldn't
go
there
in
the
first
instance
without
going
to
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the
same
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
don't
think
this
case
is
properly
here,
i
would
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
come
here,
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
dispute
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understood
mr.
rezneck
to
say
that
the
federal
court
has
no
role
at
all,
that
if
you
want
to
challenge
these
rules,
you
go
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
don't
say
there
isn't
a
dispute
about
it,
because
he
has
just
made
the
dispute--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there
is
no
other
situation
that
has
the
statute
that
mr.
rezneck
claims
makes
a
special
case
out
of
the
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
have
standing?
because
for
all
practical
purposes
you
had
asked
for
admission
to
the
district
of
columbia
bar
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
didn't
interpret
it
as
having
requested
admission
to
the
bar.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
judgment
or
its
order...
it
says,
you
are
not
entitled
to
admission.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
this
rule
keeps
you
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
certainly
said
this
rule
is
sufficient
to
keep
you
out.
