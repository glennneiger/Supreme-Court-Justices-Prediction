mr.
robert
m.
sussman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
going
back
to
the
initiation
of
proceedings
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
system,
and
to
sketch
for
this
court
some
of
the
facts
that
mr.
rezneck
omitted
to
present.
i
would
like
to
begin,
if
i
can,
by
mentioning
mr.
feldman's
qualifications
and
legal
training.
mr.
feldman
elected
to
educate
himself
as
a
lawyer
not
by
going
to
law
school,
but
by
reading
law,
that
is,
pursuing
a
program
of
legal
study
in
a
law
office,
which
is
a
recognized
method
of
training
for
the
bar
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
in
a
number
of
other
jurisdictions
around
the
country.
mr.
feldman
completed--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--no.
i
think
that
the
states
have
reasonable
latitude
in
that
regard,
subject
to
constitutional
principles,
and
there
is
no
necessary
requirement
that--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--well,
i
think
the
issue
here,
your
honor,
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
hear
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
requirements
for
bar
admission
in
the
district
of
columbia.
we
have
not
presented
our
position
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
issue
that
we
have
addressed
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
jurisdictional
issue,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
issue
which
is
now
before
the
court.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
mr.
feldman
was
admitted
in
virginia,
and
subsequently
in
maryland,
after
passing
the
bar
exams
of
both
states,
and
he
decided
to
become
associated
with
a
law
office
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
as
a
result,
and
quite
naturally,
he
sought
admission
to
the
district
of
columbia
bar.
upon
filing
his
admission
papers
with
the
committee
on
admissions,
he
was
informed
that
the
rule,
rule
46
of
the
court
of
appeals
barred
mr.
feldman
at
the
threshold
from
being
considered
for
admission
to
the
bar,
because
the
rule
required
graduation
from
an
aba
accredited
law
school,
and
mr.
feldman
had
not
attended
such
a
school.
mr.
feldman
nevertheless
felt
that
his
qualifications
were
good,
that
he
had
had
a
thorough
legal
education.
he
had
a
commitment
to
the
standards
of
the
profession,
and
he
hoped
that
he
could
find
some
way
to
persuade
the
bar
admission
authorities
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
consider
his
qualifications
on
their
merits.
the
committee
on
admissions
advised
mr.
feldman
that
the
only
way
he
could
be
considered
for
admission
to
the
bar
was
if
there
were
a
waiver
of
the
requirement
of
graduation
from
an
aba
accredited
law
school.
it
further
advised
mr.
feldman
that
there
was
one
body
and
one
body
only
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
could
grant
such
a
waiver,
and
that
was
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
itself.
mr.
feldman's
next
step
was
to
submit
a
petition
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
asking
the
court
to
waive
the
requirement
of
aba...
graduation
from
an
aba
accredited
law
school
and
consider
his
individual
qualifications,
and
i
would
like
to
stress
what
issues
were
raised
by
that
petition
and
what
issues
were
not,
because
i
think
that
these
are
the
matters
on
which
the
jurisdictional
issue
before
this
court
will
turn.
mr.
feldman
in
his
petition
asked
solely
for
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals.
he
said
in
essence,
i
acknowledge
that
i
didn't
attend
an
aba
accredited
law
school.
i
acknowledge
that
the
rule
on
its
face
bars
my
admission.
but
i
think
that
i
have
pursued
a
course
of
legal
education
which
is
entitled
to
some
consideration,
and
i
appeal
to
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
waive
the
rule
and
take
a
look
at
my
individual
qualifications.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
no,
i...
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
sits
to
review
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
state
court
systems,
but
i
do
think
that
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
sit
to
enforce
constitutional
rights
in
cases
where
constitutional
issues
have
been
properly
raised,
and--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--well,
i
think
it
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
d.c.--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--well,
that's
right.
i
think
we
would
be
happier
to
be
in
the
district
court
litigating
the
merits
of
mr.
feldman's
constitutional
claims,
and
i
don't
think,
to
address
a
point
that
mr.
rezneck
raised,
that
we
could
have
sought
review
in
this
court
from
the
denial
of
the
waiver
of
petition,
because
the
only
issue
that
was
raised
by
the
waiver
petition,
and
clearly
the
only
issue
which
was
addressed
in
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
the
rule
requiring
graduation
from
an
aba
accredited
school
should
be
waived.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
i
think
that
on
the
merits,
there
are
certain
constitutional
principles
which
should
be
applied
to
all
accreditation
schemes,
whether
they
are
schemes
involving
the
practice
of
medicine,
the
practice
of
law,
or
the
practice
of
any
other
profession,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
anomalous
if
the
federal
courts,
lower
federal
courts
were
free
to
entertain
constitutional
claims
involving
the
legality
of
a
state's
accreditation
scheme
for
medicine
but
not
to
entertain
exactly
the
same
claims
when
they
arise
in
connection
with
admission
to
the
bar.
and
i
must
say
that
i
believe
that
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
the
very
broad
rule
which
mr.
rezneck
is--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--no.
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
you
mean,
how
else
could
we
get
to
the
court
on
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--i
think
the
constitutional
claim
that
we
asserted
in
the...
in
the
district
court
and
in
our
complaint
is
not
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
a
waiver,
but
that
rule
46,
both
on
its
face
and
as
administered
over
a
period
of
time
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
was
unconstitutional.
i
don't
think
that
we
would
contend
that
every
applicant--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--we
did
but
we
didn't
request
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
and
indeed
that
is
the
very
point
that
we
are
making.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
i
think
that
is
precisely
the
issue.
i
don't
think
that
we
sought
a
waiver
as
a
matter
of
right.
we
believed
that
a
fair-minded
and
reasonable
decision-maker
would
grant
a
waiver
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--oh,
i
think
it
is
a
very
different
claim,
and--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--well,
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized
that
where
a
litigant
is
attempting
to
raise
a
constitutional
issue,
the
litigant
has
a
choice
of
forum.
that
is
to
say,
that
if
the
litigant
wishes
to
press
the
constitutional
claim
in
the
federal
court,
the
federal
court
should
be
available.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
monroe
v.
pape
is
one
of
those
cases.
the
england
case
is
another
case.
those
are
cases
arising
under
1983,
but
i
would
not
say
that
they
are
any
different
from
the
claim
pressed
here,
which
arises
directly
under
the
constitution
and
1331.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
our...
in
our
brief
are
1983
cases,
but
i
would
say
beyond
that
that
the
exhaustion
requirement
as
i
have
always
understood
it
is
a
requirement
in
most
cases
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
that
is
to
say,
if
there
is
a
reasonable
prospect
of
obtaining
administrative
relief
from
the
relevant
decision-makers
one
is
obligated
to
attempt
to
obtain
that
type
of
relief
before
then
going
into
court
and
claiming
that
the
decision-maker
has
acted
unlawfully.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
rule
which
says
that
one
is
obligated
to
raise
before
the
decision-maker
in
an
administrative
context
not
only
issues
of
discretion
but
issues
of
law
as
well,
particularly
issues
of
federal
law,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--even
if
the
decision-maker
is
the
highest
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
i
would--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--well,
your
honor,
if
i
can
respectfully
disagree,
i
think
that
in
the
absence
of
strong
countervailing
policy
considerations,
a
litigant
is
entitled
to
litigate
constitutional
issues
in
the
federal
court.
the
choice
of
forum
is
with
the
litigant.
now,
i
think
that
the
policy
behind
an
exhaustion
requirement,
be
it
in
the
administrative
context
or
in
the
judicial
context,
is
to
give
a
chance
for
the
administrator
to
address
those
issues
which
are
peculiarly
within
the
competence
of
that
administrator,
perhaps
in
the
hope
that
a
controversy
in
the
constitutional
sense
will
be
avoided.
now,
here,
we
went
to
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
to
seek
that
type
of
relief
which
was
uniquely
within
the
province
of
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
to
grant
us.
we
wanted
a
waiver
from
the
rule
because,
quite
frankly,
we
felt
that
if
there
was
any
prospect
of
attaining
admission
to
the
bar
administratively
and
informally,
much
better
to
do
that
than
to
proceed
directly
in
federal
court
and--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--well,
that's
right.
that
was
not
an
appealing
prospect,
and
we
wanted
to
make
very
sure
that
we
had
exhausted
all
possibility
of
obtaining
admission
within
the
confines
of
the
d.c.
administrative
process
for
bar
admission
before
going
to
federal
court
and
raising
our
constitutional
claim.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
your
honor,
i
think
that
we
advised
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
that
we
were
contemplating
raising
constitutional
issues.
we
identified
what
those
issues
were,
but,
and
this
is
quite
important,
we
did
not
submit
them
for
decision.
we
told
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
that
these
are
issues
that
we
are
prepared
to
raise
in
federal
court
if
and
when
the
waiver
application
is
denied.
and
i
think
that
the
order
issued
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
disposing
of
the
waiver
application
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
character
of
our
petition.
the
order
entered
by
the
court
says
that
the
petition
for
a
waiver
is
denied.
it
does
not
say
that
rule
46
has
been
examined
under
the
constitution
and
has
been
upheld.
so,
it
is
true
that
we
advised
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
were
constitutional
issues
we
wanted
to
pursue,
but
we--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--that's
right,
neither
of
the
courts
ruled
on
that
issue,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
an
issue
which
one
has
to
decide
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
petition
was
merely
administrative
in
character.
if
the
petition--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--well,
i
think
you
are
right,
if
you
conclude
that
the
petition
sought
judicial
action,
the
issues
remaining
are
res
judicata
issues.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
and
i
don't
think
that
classifying
the
petition--
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
--no,
i
think
that
you
can
decide
the
res
judicata
issue
without
considering
whether
there
was
an
impermissible
splitting
of
the
cause
of
action.
we
have
contended
in
our
brief
that
if
there
was
a
cause
of
action
asserted
by
the
waiver
petition,
it
was
a
very
different
cause
of
action
from
that
which
was
advanced
in
the
complaint
in
the
district
court.
and
of
course
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
res
judicata
that
if
the
second
case
brings
forward
a
different
cause
of
action
from
the
first
case,
then
there
is
no
res
judicata
bar.
the
issues
presented
in
the
second
case
can
be
heard.
mr.
robert
m.
sussman
well,
though,
i
think,
your
honor,
with
deference,
that
the
threshold
question
is
whether
the
causes
of
action
are
the
same.
if
the
causes
of
action
are
the
same,
the
issue
is
not...
if
the
causes
of
action
are
different,
excuse
me,
the
issue
is
not
one
of
res
judicata,
but
collateral
estoppel,
and
then
the
question
is
not
what
issues
could
have
been
raised,
but
rather
what
issues
were
in
fact
raised
and
decided.
now,
i
would
make
one
further
point
in
that
connection
which
is,
let's
assume
that
the
causes
of
action
are
absolutely
the
same
in
the
waiver
petition
and
the
district
court
complaint.
let's
also
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
denial
of
the
waiver
petition
was
action
taken
in
an
administrative
capacity.
we
would
still
say
that
mr.
feldman
was
entitled
to
do
precisely
what
he
did,
which
was
to
put
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
on
notice
that
he
planned
to
raise
constitutional
claims,
reserved
those
constitutional
claims
for
litigation
in
federal
court,
and
then
thereafter
asked
for
a
federal
court
decision.
so,
i
think
that
if
the
court
does
find
it
necessary
to
address
the
res
judicata
issues,
which
we
don't
think
are
before
the
court
for
decision,
there
is
not
just
one,
but
several
grounds
for
concluding
that
there
is
not
a
res
judicata
bar
to
considering
the
constitutional
issues
raised
by
mr.
feldman's
complaint.
thank
you,
your
honor.
