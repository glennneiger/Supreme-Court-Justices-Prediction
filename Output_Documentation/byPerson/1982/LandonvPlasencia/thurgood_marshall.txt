the
due
process
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
really
mean
is,
they
got
due
process
on
this
type
of
a
hearing,
but
it
wouldn't
be
due
process
on
a
deportation
hearing.
are
you
arguing
that
there
are
different
degrees
of
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
different
types
of
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
some
are
a
whole
lot,
and
some
are
a
little?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
that
they
should
improve
the
exclusionary
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
we
tell
them
what
to
do?
could
we
tell
them
what
type
of
rules
to
set
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
conceivably,
or
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
manulkin,
getting
back
to
what
the
government
said,
suppose
the
rule
is
changed
which
says
simply
that
at
an
explusion
hearing
you
have
the
exact
same
as
the
deportation
hearing.
would
you
be
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
want
to
rewrite
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
rather,
you
want
us
to
rewrite
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
really
want
us
to
do
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
more
can
we
do
than
say
that
they
must
give
due
process?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
had
she
lived
in
the
united
states
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
she's
got
three
children
that
are
getting
ready
to
go
in
the
army.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
she
bring
those
children
with
her?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
they
were
american
citizens.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
guess
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
couldn't
i...
i
could
personally
distinguish
on
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
importing
illegal
aliens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
is
a
distinguishing
proposition,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wait
a
minute.
let
me
understand
you
correctly.
she
is
now
free.
you
want
us
to
order
her
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
you
want
her
held
for
deportation.
you
want
us
to
say
that
she
should
be
held
for
deportation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
your
client
agree
with
you?
