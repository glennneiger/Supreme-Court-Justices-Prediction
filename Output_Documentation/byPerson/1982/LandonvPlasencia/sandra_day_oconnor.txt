justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
schulder,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
assuming
an
exclusion
proceeding
is
the
proper
proceeding,
that
the
alien
is
entitled
to
due
process
at
that
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
process
is
due,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
some
specific
period
of
time
has
to
be
given
in
which
to
prepare
for
the
hearing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
schulder,
just
to
clarify
it,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
this
court
could
be
asked
to
simply
determine
whether
she
was
entitled
to
a
deportation
proceeding
or
an
exclusion
proceeding,
and
if
it
were
determined
that
she
were
entitled
to
an
exclusion
proceeding,
just
remand
it
for
that
without
attempting
to
spell
out
all
of
the
requirements
for
that
proceeding.
is
that
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
manulkin,
if
we
could
go
back
to
the
chew
case
for
a
minute--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--would
you
agree
that
the
chew
decision
does
not
give
returning
resident
aliens
a
right
to
treatment
that
is
identical
to
that
of
a
continuously
present
resident?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
agree.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
manulkin,
if
the
alien
had
been
out
of
the
country
for
five
years
under
your
theory,
would
that
alien
be
entitled
on
coming
back
in
to
say,
it
isn't
true,
i
contest
this,
and
therefore
be
entitled
to
a
deportation
hearing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
comes
back
in
and
says,
no,
no,
that
is
not
true,
i
want
a
deportation
hearing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
difference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
your
theory,
those
facts
should
be
determined
at
a
deportation
hearing.
what
is
the
difference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
shouldn't
the
government
be
entitled
to
proceed
at
an
exclusion
proceeding,
as
the
statute
might
well
indicate,
and
simply
afford
the
alien
whatever
process
is
due?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent
is
a
permanent
resident
alien.
she
made
a
brief
visit
to
mexico.
on
her
return
to
the
united
states,
she
was
denied
admission
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
after
an
exclusion
hearing
and
a
determination
that
she
had
attempted
to
smuggle
aliens
across
the
border.
respondent
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
district
court
vacated
the
ins's
decision
and
ordered
it
to
proceed
against
respondent,
if
at
all,
only
in
a
deportation
proceeding.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
and
hold
that
a
permanent
resident
alien
returning
to
this
country
from
a
brief
visit
abroad
is
not
a
statutory
matter
entitled
to
a
deportation
proceeding
rather
than
an
exclusion
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
alien
is
excludable.
we
hold,
however,
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
alien
is
entitled
to
due
process.
we
remand
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
determine
what
procedures
are
required
in
the
exclusion
hearing
and
whether
a
respondent
was
accorded
due
process.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
