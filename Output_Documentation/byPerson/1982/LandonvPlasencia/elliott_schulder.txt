mr.
elliott
schulder
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
in
this
immigration
case
is
whether
a
permanent
resident
alien
who
is
believed
by
immigration
authorities
to
be
excludable
from
the
united
states
on
his
return
from
a
trip
abroad
is
entitled
to
litigate
the
issues
of
his
entry
and
excludability
in
a
deportation
hearing,
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case,
rather
than
in
an
exclusion
hearing,
as
congress
mandated
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
before
proceeding
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
would
like
to
put
this
question
into
some
perspective
by
briefly
reviewing
some
of
the
pertinent
statutes.
the
immigration
act
preserves
a
long-standing
distinction
between
aliens
arriving
at
the
border
seeking
admission
to
this
country
and
aliens
who
are
already
within
the
united
states.
aliens
who
are
arriving
at
the
border
seeking
admission
or
readmission
who
are
believed
not
entitled
to
enter
are
subject
to
exclusion
proceedings.
aliens
who
are
within
the
united
states
who
are
believed
not
entitled
to
remain
are
subject
to
deportation
proceedings.
the
immigration
act
provides
various
categories
of
excludable
aliens,
and
also
provides
procedures
governing
the
exclusion
of
inadmissible
aliens.
under
8
usc
1225,
every
alien
arriving
at
a
u.s.
port
of
entry
and
seeking
admission
or
readmission
to
this
country
is
subject
to
inspection
by
an
immigration
officer.
if
the
alien
does
not
appear
beyond
a
doubt
to
the
immigration
officer
to
be
entitled
to
land,
he
is
detained
for
an
exclusion
hearing
that
is
conducted
before
an
immigration
judge.
these
exclusion
procedures
apply
whenever
an
alien
attempts
an
entry
into
the
united
states.
the
term
8
usc
1101
(a)(13),
as
any
coming
of
an
alien
into
the
united
states
from
a
foreign
country.
however,
there
is
an
exception
to
this
broad
definition
in
the
case
of
permanent
resident
aliens.
a
return
to
the
united
states
following
an
unintentional
departure
by
a
lawful
permanent
resident
alien
is
not
regarded
as
an
entry.
in
rosenberg
versus
fleuti,
this
court
held
that
an
innocent,
casual,
and
brief
trip
abroad
is
deemed
not
to
have
been
intended
as
meaningfully
interruptive
of
an
alien's
permanent
residence.
the
statute
interpreted...
the
court
interpreted
the
statute
in
this
way
in
order
to
protect
resident
aliens
from
unsuspected
risks
and
unintended
consequences
of
wholly
innocent
actions.
one
of
the
factors
that
the
court
noted
in
fleuti
as
being
crucial
in
determining
the
nature
of
an
alien's
trip
is
whether
the
purpose
of
the
trip
was
to
accomplish
an
object
contrary
to
the
policies
reflected
in
our
immigration
laws.
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
respondent,
a
native
and
citizen
of
el
salvador,
was
admitted
to
the
united
states
as
a
permanent
resident
alien
in
1970.
on
june
29th,
1975,
respondent
was
returning
from
a
two-day
trip
to
mexico
with
her
husband
when
she
was
arrested
at
the
border
for
attempting
to
smuggle
six
illegal
aliens
into
this
country.
respondent
was
detained
for
an
exclusion
hearing
to
determine
whether
she
was
excludable
under
a
provision
of
the
immigration
act
that
provides
for
the
exclusion
of
any
alien
who
knowingly
and
for
gain
aids
the
attempted
illegal
entry
of
aliens
into
this
country.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
the
husband
is
a
united
states
citizen.
mr.
elliott
schulder
no,
he
was
not
charged
with
any
offense,
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
am
aware.
the
record
doesn't
reflect
otherwise.
the
exclusion
hearing
was
held
the
following--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--absolutely,
yes.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
as
this
court
noted
in
kwong
hai
chew
versus
colding,
that
a
resident
alien
returning
from
a
trip
abroad
is
entitled
to
notice
of
the
charges
and
an
opportunity...
and
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
charges.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
the
constitution
mandates
a
fixed
period
of
time.
the
period
would
have
to
be
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
preparing
adequately
to
respond
to
the
charges
in
any
given
situation.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
that's
correct.
the
court
construed--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
court
in
kwong
hai
chew
strongly
suggested
that
it
would
have
constitutional
problems
with
the
regulation
that
it
construed.
mr.
elliott
schulder
it
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
hold
that
there
was
an
absolute--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
immigration--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
immigration
service
has
accepted
that
case,
and
the
district
of
columbia--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
implications
of
the
case,
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
decision
in
kwong
hai
chew
versus
rogers
that
an
alien,
resident
alien
is
entitled
to
due
process--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--no,
your
honor.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
immigration
service
has
essentially
acceded
to
the
strong
suggestion
by
this
court
in
kwong
hai
chew
versus
colding
that
any
procedure
involving
a
returning
resident
alien
that
appears
to
be
contrary
to
due
process
would
be
struck
down
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
but
this
court
in
kwong
hai
chew
and
in
the
later
cases
that
discuss
kwong
hai
chew
do,
i
believe,
make
the
point...
kwong
hai
chew
was
not
a
due
process
case
as
such,
but
in
rosenberg
versus
fleuti,
for
example,
the
court
described
kwong
hai
chew...
the
decision
in
kwong
hai
chew
as
having
constitutional
overtones.
i
concede
that
there
was
no
absolute
constitutional
holding
in
that
case,
but
for
these
purposes,
in
any
event,
the
immigration
service
has
accepted
the
proposition
that
a
returning
resident
alien
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
and...
notice
and
a
hearing,
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
charges.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
regulations
themselves
do
not
differentiate,
but
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
its
decisions
has
differentiated
between--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
only
standard
that
i
am
specifically
aware
of,
your
honor,
is
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
has
said
that
an
alien
may
be
excluded
on
the
basis
of
charges
that
are
not
necessarily
included
in
the
formal
written
notice
of
the
charges
received
prior
to
a
hearing.
however,
the
alien
is
entitled
to
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
charges.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
specific
holding
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
that--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--it
is
not
absolutely
clear
from
the
record
what
the
notice
was.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes,
the
immigration
service's
regulations
provide
that
the
immigration
judge
must
advise
the
alien
of
the
right
to
obtain
counsel--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--at
the
outset
of
the
hearing,
the
alien
is
so
advised,
but
the
notice
of
charges
that
is
required--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
the
service's
current
regulations
provide
that
the
alien
is
to
be
informed--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--at
the
time
of
the
hearing
here,
there
was
no
such
provision
that
the
alien
be
informed
of
the
availability
of--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--that's
correct.
at
the
conclusion
of
respondent's
exclusion
hearing,
the
immigration
judge
found
that
respondent
was
excludable
based
on
clear,
convincing,
and
unequivocal
evidence.
this
is
the
same
standard
that
applies
in
deportation
hearings.
in
addition,
the
judge
found
that
respondent
had
made
an
entry
because
she
engaged
in
conduct
contrary
to
the
immigration
laws.
thus,
under
fleuti,
respondent's
departure
was
not
unintended
within
the
exception
to
the
entry
doctrine
in
the
immigration
act.
after
exhausting
her
administrative
appeals,
respondent
petitioned
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california.
the
district
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
immigration
service
with
directions
to
proceed
against
respondent,
if
at
all,
only
in
deportation
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
and
held
that
whenever
a
resident
alien
returning
from
trip
abroad
claims
that
his
trip
was
not
meaningfully
interruptive
of
his
permanent
residence,
the
issues
of
entry
and
excludability
must
be
litigated
in
deportation
and
not
in
exclusion
proceedings.
thus,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
holding,
every
returning
resident
alien
coming
back
from
a
trip
abroad,
no
matter
the
duration
or
no
matter
the
purpose
for
which
that
trip
was
undertaken,
is
automatically
entitled
to
return
to
this
country
so
long
as
that
alien
claims
that
his
departure
was
not
meaningfully
interruptive.
there
is
no
basis
in
law
for
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
it
is
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
by
holding
that
resident
aliens
are
entitled
to
deportation
proceedings,
has
disregarded
the
clear
distinction
that
congress
drew
in
the
immigration
act
between
exclusion
proceedings
and
deportation
proceedings.
if
there
is
one
thing
that
is
clear
in
the
area
of
immigration
law,
it
is
that
congress
has
broad
authority
over
immigration
matters,
including
particularly
the
admission
of
aliens
into
this
country.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
has
interfered
with
the
congress's
exercise
of
its
authority.
the
court
purported
to
base
its
decision
on
kwong
hai
chew
versus
colding,
and
the
subsequent
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
kwong
hai
chew
versus
rogers,
which
established
that
the
immigration
authorities
at
an
exclusion
hearing
have
the
burden
of
proving
excludability.
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
assumed
that
the
immigration
service
has
ignored
the
burden
of
proof
requirement
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
kwong
hai
chew
versus
rogers,
but
in
fact,
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
the
immigration
service
has
accorded
returning
resident
aliens
a
hearing
at
which
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proving
excludability,
so
that
the
court's
decision
is
based
on
a
totally
erroneous
impression
of
the
type
of
procedures
that
are
available
at
an
exclusion
hearing
to
a
resident
alien.
respondent
has
tried
to
defend
the
holding
below
by
raising
some
additional
arguments.
respondent
first
argues
that
the
procedures
available
to
permanent
resident
aliens
in
exclusion
proceedings
do
not
satisfy
due
process
standards.
we
disagree
with
respondent's
framing
of
the
issue
here.
the
government,
as
i
mentioned
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
fully
agrees
that
resident
aliens
should
receive
procedures
that
meet
due
process
standards,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
resident
aliens
are
entitled
to
a
deportation
hearing
rather
than
to
the
exclusion
hearing
that
congress
provided
for
in
the
act.
if
the
procedures
at
exclusion
hearings
need
to
be
strengthened
to
meet
due
process
standards,
the
remedy
is
to
provide
proper
safeguards
in
exclusion
hearings,
not
to
provide
aliens
with
a
right
to
deportation
hearings,
which
is
simply
contrary
to
congress's
decision
in
establishing
exclusion
hearings
in
the
immigration
act.
respondent
also
argues--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--yes,
we
believe
that
respondent
did
receive
due
process,
but
we
like
to
point
out
that
respondent
did
not
really
raise
the
due
process
issues
that
she
is
now
raising
here
in
the
courts
below.
for
example,
the
claim
about
inadequate
notice
was
never
raised
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that
is
clearly
an
argument,
yes.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
deportation--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--i'm
not--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--there
are
different
types
of
due
process,
depending
on
the--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--well,
our
position
is
that
it
is
not
absolutely
necessary
that
the
precise
procedures
that
happen
to
be
available
in
deportation
hearings
have
to
be
provided
in
exclusion
hearings.
there
are
different
levels.
that
is
true.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct,
but
the
point,
the
major
point
that
we
make
here
is
that
even
if
there
was
a
problem
here
in
terms
of
the
process
that
was
provided,
the
ninth
circuit's
remedy
was
totally
wrong.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
if
the
immigration
service
is
informed
of
the
deficiencies
in
any
of
its
procedures
in
exclusion
hearings,
it
should
be...
it
would
provide
for
regulations,
i
would
think.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct,
but
i'm
saying
that
the
service
most
likely
would
provide
specifically
for
regulations
that
would
deal
with
permanent
resident
aliens
in
an
exclusion
setting.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
the
court
conceivably
could
say
that
the
particular
procedures--
mr.
elliott
schulder
--the
court
could
certainly
say
that
the
procedures
that
were
made
available
here
were
not
adequate,
but
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
earlier
is
that
the
issue
really
is
not
properly
presented
here,
because
it
hadn't
been
presented
either
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
because
of
the
peculiar
posture
of
the
case,
there
is
really
no
basis
for
relying
on
this
as
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
since
the
proper
remedy
if
due
process
was
not
provided
would
not
be
to
send
the
case
back
for
a
deportation
hearing,
but
instead
to
send
the
case
back
for
an
exclusion
hearing.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
she
certainly
had
the
opportunity
to
raise
that
claim
in
the
district
court.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
she
did
argue
that
she
was
entitled
to
the
procedural
safeguards
of
the
deportation
hearing,
but
what
the
record
actually
shows
is
that
she
was
arguing
for
an
entitlement
to
entry
into
the
country
and
being
placed
in
deportation
proceedings
rather
than
to
the
same
types
of
safeguards
that
happen
to
be
available
in
the
deportation
context.
mr.
elliott
schulder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
respondent
attempts
to
justify
the
court
of
appeals
decision
by
arguing
that
somehow
it
is
unfair
for
a
resident
alien
to
be...
to
have
both
the
issues
of
entry
and
excludability
turn
on
a
single
immigration
offense.
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
respondent
was
found
to
have
attempted
to
smuggle
illegal
aliens
into
the
country,
and
that
finding
established
both
that
she
was
excludable
and
also
that
she
had
made
a
meaningful
interruption
of
her
permanent
residence,
and
thus
had
been
attempting
an
entry.
but
we
have
responded
to
this
argument
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
6
through
8,
and
i
would
essentially
like
to
rely
on
that,
but
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
respondent's
argument
essentially
is
that
the
immigration
act
requires
the
immigration
service
to
admit
a
resident
alien
into
the
country
because
of
an
alleged
immigration
violation.
in
other
words,
if
the
entry
and
excludability
issues
both
turn
on
an
immigration
offense
rather
than
on
two
other
factors,
technical
violations,
then
the
immigration
service
must
allow
the
alien
to
enter.
we
don't
think
that
congress
conceivably
intended
this
result
when
it
established
separate
proceedings
for
exclusion
and
deportation
of
aliens.
finally,
i
must
emphasize
that
there
is
no
danger
of
a
resident
alien
being
excluded
if
he
has
not
made
an
entry.
if
the
evidence
in
an
exclusion
hearing
shows
that
the
trip
was
in
fact
innocent,
casual,
and
brief,
the
exclusion
hearing
must
be
terminated,
and
the
alien
must
be
allowed
into
the
united
states.
so
that
there
is
no
danger
here
that
an
alien
will
be
found
excludable
where
in
fact
the
evidence
shows
that
the
resident
alien,
at
least
under
the
terms
of
the
immigration
statute,
was
not
in
fact
making
an
entry.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
elliott
schulder
we
submit
that
it
is
sufficient
at
the
time
of
returning
to
the
country.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
held
to
that
effect
in
the
palatian
case.
mr.
elliott
schulder
absolutely.
in
fact,
respondent's
testimony
acknowledged...
she
herself
acknowledged
that
she
did
intend
to
bring
these
aliens
in
illegally.
the
only
issue
at
the
hearing
was
one
of
whether
she
had
done
it
for
gain
or
not.
that
went
to
the
excludability
question,
not
to
the
entry
question.
mr.
elliott
schulder
i'm
not
exactly
aware,
but
i
believe
there
was
a
statement...
i
believe
there
were
statements
from
the
alien
witnesses
that
were
admitted.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
these
were
statements
that
were,
i
believe,
admitted
into
evidence.
they
are
part
of
the
administrative
record.
mr.
elliott
schulder
well,
she
was
paroled
into
this
country
by
the
district
director.
as
far
as
we
know,
she
is
living
in
this
country.
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
schulder
yes,
your
honor.
respondent
has
conceded
here
that
greater
procedural
protections
could
be
provided
for
resident
aliens
in
exclusion
proceedings.
i
think
it
is
quite
apparent
from
mr.
manulkin's
argument
that
what
respondent
really
wants
here
is
the
opportunity
to
be
eligible
for
a
whole
variety
of
discretionary
forms
of
relief
that
are
available
to
aliens
only
in
a
deportation
context,
and
not
in
an
exclusion
context,
but
due
process
does
not
entitle
an
alien
to
these
substantive
forms
of
relief.
it
is
congress
and
the
statute
that
provides
which
aliens
in
which
types
of
proceedings
are
entitled
to
certain
substantive
remedies.
i
think
it
is
simply
a
distortion
of
the
whole
statutory
scheme
to
allow
resident
aliens
like
respondent
to
be
placed
in
deportation
proceedings
where
they
will
be
given
all
kinds
of
substantive
remedies
that
congress
specifically
declined
to
give
to
these
people
when
it
separated
exclusion
proceedings
from
deportation
proceedings
in
the
statute.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
respondent's
claims
of
inadequate
notice
and
the
other
procedural
deficiencies
that
she
alleges
are
a
red
herring
here.
she
could
have
raised
these
claims
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
and
in
fact
she
was
represented
by
counsel
in
a
motion
to
reopen
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
and
if
her
claims
had
been
rejected,
she
could
have
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
to
this
court
raising
the
due
process
claims.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
she
did
not
raise
any
of
these
claims
either
before
the
bia
or
in
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals.
finally,
i
think
justice
o'connor
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
she
asked
my
adversary
whether
he
conceded
that
where
an
alien
has
taken
a
trip
of
five
years
or
of
extended
duration,
whether
he
would
still
be
arguing
that
there
was
an
entitlement
to
a
deportation
proceeding.
counsel
conceded
in
response
to
that
that
there
would
not
be
such
entitlement,
but
the
whole
point
of
this
case
is
where
and
in
what
forum
is
the
determination
made
as
to
whether
the
trip
was
brief
or
not.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
number
of
cases
has
held
that
fairly
extensive
trips
abroad
do
not
amount
to
extensive
enough
visits
to
interrupt
permanent
residence.
and
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
point
in
response
to
respondent's
argument
relying
on
kwong
hai
chew
versus
colding,
the
language
that
a
resident
alien
is
to
be
assimilated
to
an
alien
continuously
residing
and
physically
present.
at
page
596
of
volume
344
of
u.s.
reports,
it
is
true
that
the
court
said
for
purposes
of
his
constitutional
right
to
due
process
we
assimilate
petitioner's
status
to
that
of
an
alien
continuously
residing
and
physically
present
in
the
united
states.
but
several
pages
later,
on
page
601,
the
court
says,
it
may
well
be
that
an
alien's
ultimate
right
to
remain
in
the
united
states
is
subject
to
alteration
by
statute
or
authorized
regulation
because
of
a
voyage
undertaken
by
him
to
foreign
ports.
the
point
of
our
submission
here
is
that
the
determination
whether
an
alien
is
entitled
to
reenter
the
united
states
after
a
trip
abroad
is
to
be
made
in
an
exclusion
setting,
as
congress
provided
in
the
immigration
statute.
the
ninth
circuit,
and
respondent
here,
have
provided
absolutely
no
justification
in
law
for
departing
from
the
statutory
scheme.
thank
you--
