justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
service
has
not,
as
i
understand
it,
drafted
separate
regulations
to
cover
the
kind
of
hearing
that
is
required
for
a
returning
permanent
resident
as
opposed
to
a
brand
new
person.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
anything
other
than
deportation
regulations
and
exclusion
hearing
regulations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
don't
in
your
actual
rules
differentiate
between
the
two
kinds
of
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can
we
tell
from
its
decisions,
for
example,
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question?
what
kind
of
advance
notice
is
the
returning
permanent
resident
entitled
to
receive
before
being
put
on
trial?
ten
minutes,
or
24
hours,
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sounds
like
there
is
no
requirement
of
advanced
notice
in
advance
of
the
hearings,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
and
here,
what
was
the
notice?
i
don't
think
we
can
even
tell
from
the
record.
it
may
have
been
ten
minutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
person
be
advised
of
any
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
in
advance
of
the
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing,
is
what
happened
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
advice
include
advice
as
to
how
to
find
a
lawyer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
hearing
as
conducted
in
this
case
did
not
comply
with
the
regulations
that
you
now
have
in
effect.
would
not
have
complied
had
those
regulations
been
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
once
more?
is
it
the
government's
position
that
at
this
particular
hearing,
this
person
did
receive
due
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
i
understand
you,
you
do
concede
that
the
process
required
in
the
exclusion
of
a
permanent
resident
alien
may
be
greater
than
the
process
required
for
an
alien
who
is
not
a
permanent
alien.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
also
say
that
the
process
given
here
satisfies
your
concept
of
that
intermediate
level
of
process
that
the
constitution
requires.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
would
the
proper...
you
say
the
remedy
isn't
to
require
a
deportation
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
remedy
is
to
require
sort
of
an
intermediate
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
how
should
that
be
done,
assuming
that
we
thought
you
were
wrong
on
the
adequacy
of
the
process
in
this
case?
how
should
the
rules
for
such
a
hearing
be
formulated?
you
are
saying,
well,
they
don't
have
deportation,
and
if
you
conceded
that
the
exclusion
rules
were
not
adequate
in
this
intermediate
category,
what
is
to
be
done
in
the
government's
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
case
has
sort
of
a
peculiar
procedural
history,
because
the
alien
was
successful
in
persuading,
i
guess,
both
the
magistrate
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
she
was
entitled
to
a
deportation
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
really
wasn't
an
occasion
for
her
to
say,
well,
in
the
alternative,
if
i
don't
get
that,
i
should
at
least
get
something
more
than
i
received
in
this
particular
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
on
the
meaningful
departure
exception
to
the
general
rule?
what
point
in
time
is
relevant
for
determining
the
alien's
intent
when
a
criminal
activity
is
disclosed
as
we
assume
was
true
here?
is
it
important
whether
the
intent
to
engage
in
criminal
activity
was
held
at
the
time
of
departure,
or
is
it
sufficient
if
it
is
at
the
time
of
return?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
satisfy
that
clearly
here
even
if...
assuming
your
proof
is
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point,
on
the
gain,
the
trial
examiner,
the
judge,
whatever
he
was
called,
on
page
33
of
the
abstract
asked
one
of
the
witnesses
if
it
was
the
witness's
understanding
that
he
was
going
to
pay
the
alien
an
amount
of
$200
after
he
arrived
in
los
angeles,
and
he
said
yes,
he
had
that
understanding,
although
he
didn't
indicate
whether
it
was
based
on
conversation
with
the
alien.
one
thing
puzzled
me
in
reading
this.
i
wonder
where
the
trial
judge
got
the
basis
for
that
question.
does
the
trial
judge
look
at
affidavits
during
the
hearing
that
are
not
made
a
part
of
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
they
be
things
that
the
trial
examiner
would
look
at
in
an
ex
parte
fashion
during
a
hearing
of
this
kind?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
mr.
schulder,
where
is
the
respondent
now?
is
she
in
this
country?
