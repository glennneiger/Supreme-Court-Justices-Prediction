mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
begin
argument
with
a
little
discussion
of
the
manner
of
the
framing
of
the
issues
by
the
court
below,
by
the
petitioner,
and
by
the
respondent,
because
i
think
that
will
tend
to
simplify,
at
least
for
my
purposes,
further
argument,
the
reasoning
behind
our
argument
or
behind
our
briefs,
and
behind
the
decision
and
the
rationale
of
the
court
below.
the
court
below
stated
the
issue
as
whether
plasencia
was
entitled
to
have
her
violation
of
the
immigration
laws
and
the
purpose
of
her
trip
determined
in
deportation
rather
than
exclusion
proceedings.
now,
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
respondent--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--in
the...
i
am
sorry.
are
you
asking
whether
the
notice
is
different
in
the
two,
deportation
and
exclusion?
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
yes.
in
a
deportation
proceeding,
the
title
8
of
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
section
242,
does
require
seven
days'
notice
be
given
to
a
deportee.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
the
content
is
different--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--from
the
record...
i
was
not
present
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
but
from
the
record,
i
can
only
determine
that
the
notice
was
written
to
her
a
few
minutes
before
the
judge
proceeded,
the
immigration
judge
in
this
case
proceeded
with
the
presentation
of
the
case
and
allowed
the
trial
attorney
to
go
forward,
and
from
the
record
again,
i
only
discern
that
the
judge
read
that
you
are
being
charged
with
aiding
and
abetting
the
entry
of
aliens
into
the
united
states
for
gain,
the
illegal
entry
of
those
aliens,
although
i
will
say
that
the
notice
itself
was
a
little
difficult
to
read,
and
i
noticed
that
someone
in
fact
had
to
make
some
marks
over
it
to
be
read.
now,
in
a
deportation
proceeding,
the
notice
is
somewhat
different.
there
is
an
order
to
show
cause
that
is
issued
on
the
respondent
that
has
a
number
of
factual
allegations,
such
as
in
her
case
it
would
have
said,
you
are
a
native
and
citizen
of
el
salvador,
you
entered
the
united
states
as
a
permanent
resident
on
whatever
date
it
was
in
1970,
march,
1970,
and
you
left
the
united
states
and
departed
from
the
united
states
on
such
and
so
date,
and
you
were
charged
with,
and
found
with
aliens
in
your
automobile,
upon
your
re-entry
to
the
united
states
on
such
and
so
date.
and
then,
after
those
allegations
of
fact
are
being
charged,
then
it
will
say
the
legal
ground
for
charge
of
deportability.
in
this
case,
it
would
have
said
that
therefore,
you
are
excludable
from
the
united
states
under
section
212(a)(31)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
now,
that
is
the
way
a
deportation
notice
would
in
fact
be
presented
to
her
seven
days
before
the
hearing
was
to
commence,
and
then,
of
course,
at
that
hearing
it
is
simply
an
arraignment
type
of
a
hearing,
where
she
is
just
asked
to
plead,
do
you
admit
the
facts
and
admit
deportability
or
deny
them?
if
in
fact
she
has
counsel
present,
counsel
in
almost
all
instances
will
ask
for
some
additional
time
in
which
to
review
the
evidence
against
her.
now,
in
an
exclusion
proceeding
such
as
this
at
the
border,
it
is
extremely
difficult,
most
obviously,
for
any
alien
who
does
not
speak
our
language
and
is...
in
this
case,
mrs.
plasencia,
of
course,
was
at
san
isidro,
100
miles
from
her
home
in
los
angeles,
and
it
was
extremely
difficult
for
her
at
that
remote
location
to
obtain
counsel
with
approximately
maybe
12
hours'
notice.
it
is
hard
to
tell
from
the
record.
it
looks
as
though
she
was
arrested
the
evening
before,
and
the
hearing
concluded
at
11:00
a.m.
the
next
morning,
so
she
probably
had
around
12
hours
to
obtain
counsel.
they
were
not
wealthy
people,
and
so
they
may
very
well
have
had
to
have
contacted
one
of
the
organizations
in
los
angeles
that
were
able
to
do
pro
bono
or
other
kinds
of
free
representation.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
the
difficulty
that
we
feel
there
is
with
that
type
of
a
route
would
be
the
preclusion
of
all
of
those
sections
of
the
immigration
act
that
are
not
regulation
but
statutory
sections,
such
as
a
stay
of
deportation
in
section
243(h),
which
she
would
very
possibly--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--well,
we
certainly
don't...
yes,
we
certainly
don't
want
to
cause
a
multiplicity
of
litigation.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--no.
we
do
not,
justice.
what
we
basically
wish
for
this
court
to
do
is
to
recognize
the
respondent
in
the
position
of--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--i
think
chew
v.
colding
is
our
answer.
i
think
the
chew
v.
colding
decision
in
1953
is
the
answer.
if
you
assimilate
mrs.
plasencia
to
the
status
of
a
continuing
permanent
resident
who
continues
to
reside
in
the
united
states
even
after
and
even
during
a
brief
visit
outside
the
united
states,
then
she
must
be
given
deportation
proceedings,
if
she
has
in
fact
assimilated
to
that
status.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
in
fact,
i
believe
he
was
an
american
merchant
seaman,
that's
correct,
yes,
and
he
had--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--on
a
ship,
and
for
four
months
he
had
been
gone
from
the
united
states,
and
he
was
without
any
visible
family,
or
there
were
no
particular
hardships
in
terms
of
his
home.
his
home
was
the
ship.
and
also,
he
was
also
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
policies
of
the
immigration
laws
in
that
his
presence
in
the
united
states
the
attorney
general
felt
would
be
opposed
to
the
national
interest,
and
in
that
regard
he
was
excludable,
and
of
course
in
our
case
it
is
similar.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
no.
no,
he
did
not
bring
back
illegal
aliens.
we
would
argue
that
the
evidence
is
not
completely
clear
in
this
case
whether
mrs.
plasencia,
if
in
fact
there
had
been
a
charge
of
smuggling
aliens,
would
have
been
convicted
of
a
charge
of
aiding
and
abetting
illegal
entry,
and
that
her
husband
in
fact
was
driving
the
car.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
yes.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
no.
no,
i
would
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
and
the
reason
i
don't
agree
with
that
is
because
of
the
language
in
the
chew
v.
colding,
that
specific
language
that
says,
"to
protect
a
status
described
in
those
cases
as
assimilated
to
that
of
an
alien
continuously
residing
and
physically
present
in
the
united
states.
"
that
chew
was
to
be
considered
in
that
light,
and
then,
of
course,
the
chew
v.
rogers
decision,
which
was
five
years
later,
in
1958.
the
d.c.
circuit,
upon
remand
from
this
court,
made
the
determination
that
we
will...
the
court
will
remand
for
deportation
proceedings
mr.
chew,
and
i
think
that
is
a
correction
that
we
have
to
make
of
the
government's
brief.
if
you
read
the
last
sentence,
in
fact,
of
the
chew
v.
rogers
decision,
it
specifically
says
we
are
remanding
for
deportation
proceedings.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
yes,
that
is
true,
and
agrees,
they
felt,
agreed
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
case
was
in
fact...
you
are
right...
begun
before
1952,
but
in
actuality
this
court's
decision
was
rendered
in
1953,
after
the
1952
immigration
act.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
no,
it
did
in
one
sense.
section
101(a)(13)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
which
defined
entry,
they
did
in
the
footnotes
describe
some
of
the
congressional
intent
as
to
the
reasoning
behind
this
change
that
was
upcoming
in
the
'52
act
in
that
statute,
which
dealt
with
the
harshness
of
the
strict
entry
rule,
and
it
dealt
very
carefully
with
the
64
years,
as
it
stated
in
the
footnotes,
of
cases
that
had
come
before,
that
had
tried
to
accept
to
that
strict
harshness.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
no.
it
basically
was
talking
about
what
the
definition
of
entry
was
to
be
in
the
1952
act,
and
by
the
time
the
court's
decision
in
fact
was
published,
the
'52
act
was
history.
it
had
in
fact
been
promulgated,
and
passed
by
congress.
i
think
i
would
like
at
this
point
to
again
restate
the
issue
difference
in
terms
of
the
emphasis
by
the
government
and
the
respondent.
the
government
states
the
charge
of
excludability
itself,
just
the
charge
calls
for
a
conclusion
of
meaningful
departure,
and
therefore
calls
for
a
conclusion
of
exclusion
rather
than
deportation,
not
the
proof
of
the
charge,
the
making
of
the
charge
by
the
immigration
service.
the
respondent
emphasizes
that
the
person
is
a
returning
permanent
resident
who
has
lived
in
the
united
states,
has
a
home
in
the
united
states,
had
been
admitted
to
the
united
states
as
a
permanent
resident
at
one
time,
had
gone
through
all
of
the
inspection
process,
had
been
given
a
permanent
resident
card,
and
then
made
a
brief
visit,
a
two-day
visit
to
tiajuana,
and
was
returning
from
that
two-day
visit.
now,
the
question
is
not
whether
the
charge
of
smuggling
aliens
or
aiding
and
abetting
illegal
entry
is
true
or
false
at
that
point,
until
there
has
been
a
hearing
to
make
that
determination.
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
the
district
director
of
immigration
handed
this
piece
of
paper,
which
was
the
exclusion
notice,
to
mrs.
plasencia,
the
mere
handing,
that
act
of
handing
that
to
her,
made
her
excludable
instead
of
deportable.
that
is
what
we
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
understanding,
that
approach,
and
we
feel
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
rosenberg
versus
fleuti,
which
is
what
we
would
like
to
see
happen
in
this
case,
which
is
that
a
deportation
proceeding
should
have
been
initiated
under
section
241(a)(1)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
which
states
that
a
person
is
now
deportable
if
they
were
at
the
time
of
any
entry
excludable.
now,
of
course,
the
32
grounds
of
excludability
are
encompassed
within
section
241(a)(1),
so
the
government
certainly
would
have
not
been
prejudiced
by
the
bringing
of
that
deportation
charge,
and
through
section
212(a)(31),
could
have
then
been
adjudicated
in
a
deportation
setting,
and
it
is
possible
that
the
conclusion
of
that
case
would
have
been
that
she
was
found
excludable
because
she
had...
deportable
because
she
had
been
excludable
at
the
time
of
entry.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
the
evidence
is
very
difficult
from
the
20-some
pages
of
transcript
to
determine,
i
feel.
i
feel
it
is
very
conflicting
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
possible
that
she
was
the
smuggler,
whether
that
was
in
fact
a
matter
of
gain
on
her
part
when
$25
was
paid
to
her
husband
for
gas.
i
think
it
is
a
very
difficult
proof
by
the
government,
and
in
fact
i
might
even
suggest
that
there
might
have
been
some
reason
for
the
government
not
going
forward
on
a
criminal
charge.
the
question
was
asked
earlier
in
that
regard.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
you
mean,
if
she
had
remained
in
mexico
for
five
years?
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
no,
no.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
no.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
because
we
feel
that...
we
agree
with
the
shaughnessy
versus
mezei
decision
of
this
court
when
it
stated
that
mr.
mezei,
having
left
the
united
states
for
19
months
to
go
to
hungary
without
the
permission
of
this--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--no,
no,
because
in
that
particular
case,
there
is
not
a
brief
visit
outside
the
united
states,
in
either
shaughnessy
versus
mezei
or
the
factual
situation
that
you
just
presented.
we
are
not
arguing
with
the
fact
that
the
immigration
service
has
the
right
to
control
its
borders
as
to
persons
who
are
not
residing
therein.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
i
think
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
with
a
person
put
into
that
situation
would
be
the
sections
dealing
with
the
amelioration
of
the
hardships
attendant
to
being
deported
from
the
united
states,
such
as,
i
mentioned
earlier
section
243(h)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
which
states
that
a
person
can
apply
for
a
stay
of
deportation
if
there
is
a
well-founded
fear
of
the
likelihood
of
persecution
on
the
basis
of
race,
religion,
or
political
opinion.
now,
this
particular
individual,
for
example,
mrs.
plasencia,
has
a
u.s.
citizen
husband,
four
permanent
resident
children
who
were
coming
of
military
age,
who
were
getting
older.
taking
this
family
back
to
el
salvador
might
have
given
her,
and
a
showing
to
the
court
and
proof
to
the
court
that
she
has
a
fear
of
likelihood
of
returning
to
el
salvador
with
this
family,
might
well
have
occasioned
the
immigration
judge
to
grant
a
stay
of
deportation,
but
as
the
cases,
and
this
court
is
one
of
the
decision-makers
on
that
issue,
that
243(h)
does
not
apply
to
a
person
who
is
a
respondent
in
exclusion
proceedings.
so
she
would
be
precluded
from
making
that
application
for,
in
the
vernacular,
asylum
or
refugee
status.
also,
another
preclusion
would
be
section
244(a)(1)
and
244(d)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
in
that
she
could
not
apply
for
a
suspension
of
deportation
in
an
exclusion
proceeding.
again,
the
courts,
this
court
and
other
courts
have
found
that
that
application
could
not
be
made
in
an
exclusion
proceeding
by
an
excludee
only
by
someone
who
is
in
deportation
proceedings,
and
of
course
she
could
maybe
very
easily
show
that
it
would
be
extreme
and
unusual
hardship
to
herself
and
her
family
to
in
fact
return
to
el
salvador,
a
country
in
the
middle
of
a
civil
war
and
great
strife,
and
where
maybe
u.s.
citizen
men
are
not
to
be
invited
to
remain,
and
permanent
resident
children
are
not
going
to
be
treated
in
a
hospitable
fashion,
especially--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
she
has
been
living
in
the
united
states.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
how
long
had
she
been
living
in
the
united
states?
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
this
occurred
in
1975,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
under
the
possible
statute
of
limitations,
i
believe
not.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
yes.
yes,
i
believe
that
could
be
brought.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
the
government
did
have
written
statements
from
all
of
the
witnesses,
as
we
understand
it,
and
written
statements
are
admissible
in
deportation
proceedings
when
there
is
unavailability
of
the
individuals
to
testify,
so
i
believe
the
government
would
be
very
little
prejudiced
by
holding
a
deportation
hearing
today.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
particular
case,
i
might
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
written
statements
that
were
presented
as
evidence
in
court
were
never
read
to
mrs.
plasencia,
but
yet
she
was
being
asked
to
cross
examine
the
maker
of
those
statements.
she
was
not...
she
was,
if
you
will
look
at
the
transcript
of
the
record,
she
was
handed
the
statement
in
english,
saying,
do
you
object
to
the
admission
of
this
statement,
but
there
is
no
indication
that
it
was...
she
doesn't
read
english...
that
it
was
ever
translated
to
her.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
she
had...
it
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
only
one
of
those
was
a
son,
but
she
had
come
to
the
united
states
in
probably
the
late
sixties,
about
1968,
and
then
immigrated
in
1970.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
yes,
she
did.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
no,
the
children
never
became
american
citizens.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
they
are
still
permanent
residents.
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
her
husband
is
a
u.s.
citizen,
and
in
fact
he
immigrated
her
to
the
united
states
in
1970
while
remaining
here,
which
was
through
an
adjustment
of
status
type
of
approach,
which
precludes
her
from
having
to
go
back
to
san
salvador
to
obtain
her
permanent
residence.
i
really
believe
that
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
overrule
chew
v.
colding.
looking
at
the
case,
looking
at
this
case,
the
facts
of
the
two
cases,
i
cannot
see
any
substantive
differences.
it
has
been
mentioned
that
mr.
chew
did
not
leave
for
a
foreign
country,
yet
the
ship
did,
of
course,
stop
in
foreign
ports.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
because
he
was
a
danger
to
national
security,
as
i
would--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--it
would
be
a
matter,
i
suppose,
of
weighing
which
is
more
in
violation
of
immigration
policy,
to
aid
and
abet
illegal
entry
or
to
become
a
danger
to
national
security.
i
am
not
maybe--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--it
only...
like
i
said,
your
honor,
in
the
footnotes,
discussed
101(a)(13),
which--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--yes,
it
does.
you
are
right.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
no,
you
are
right,
it
does
not
go
into
a
long
discussion
of
the
1952
act,
but
i
believe
i
would
differ
in
that
it
did
in
fact
construe
the
situation
of
a
continuing
permanent
resident
as
to
the
amount
of
procedural
protections
and
due
process
that
that
individual
is
entitled
to,
whatever
the
statute
is,
whether
it
was
a
pre-'52
statute
or
a
post-'52.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
it
did
attempt
to
limit--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--well,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
you
are
right,
that
it
did
construe
a
regulation,
and
i
believe
that
it
did
attempt
to
narrow
at
the
very
latter
part
of
the
case,
after
it
had
already
said
these
words
in
different
contexts
three
or
four
times,
"assimilated
to
the
status
of
a
continuing
permanent
resident.
"
it
said
that
four
times
through
the
case,
and
it
is
very
difficult
unless
you
read
chew
having
been
outside
the
united
states
for
four
months,
our
client
having
been
outside
the
united
states
for
two
days,
both
challenging
immigration
policies--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--that
is
basically
true.
that
is
basically
true,
your
honor.
you
were
dealing,
again,
like
you
said,
with
a
regulation,
not
a
statute.
here
we
do
have
a
statute.
the
statute,
of
course,
does
include
an
element
of
gain,
and
i
think
it
is
important
also
for
this
court
to
become
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
is
different
for
criminal
proceedings
than
it
is
for
civil
proceedings.
section
1324,
title
8
of
the
united
states
code
talks
about
smuggling
of
aliens
as
being
a
crime,
but
it
does
not
bother
to
mention
the
word
"gain".
gain
is
not
an
element
in
the
criminal
context.
it
is
only
in
the
immigration
context.
and
because
of
that,
it
is
really
a
more
difficult
prove
up,
i
would
guess,
for
the
government
in
a
criminal
context,
and
again
i
draw
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
government
did
not
proceed
against
either
mr.
or
mrs.
plasencia
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
bringing
a
criminal
charge,
and
in
fact
if
they
had,
we
might
not
be
here
today,
because
we
would
then
have
had
procedural
protections
in
that
criminal
context.
we
would
have
had
right
to
counsel,
and
notice,
and
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
rights,
as
you--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--well,
it
wouldn't,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
help
her
if
she
were
found
guilty,
your
honor.
it
would
in
fact
cause
an
easier
situation
for
the
immigration
judge
to
present
the
conviction
as
evidence
of
excludability,
and
then
we
might
have
a
little
different...
more
difficulty
with
the
government
in
arguing
against
them.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
they
did
not
though,
your
honor.
they
did
not.
they
didn't
proceed
against
either
one.
the
evidence
was
very
contradictory,
and
they
might
have
read
the
evidence,
and
they
might
have
seen
that
this
one
witness,
the
number
one
witness
in
the
case,
in
fact
made
contradictory
statements
the
night
before
under
oath
in
both
cases.
she
even
misstated
her
name.
she
misstated
how
much
money
supposedly
was
to
be
promised,
$300
the
night
before,
$250
the
next
morning.
she
misstated
the
fact
that
it
was
the
wife
of
her
uncle
that
she
was
traveling
with.
in
fact,
during
the
hearing
she
says,
i
have
no
family.
so
if
you
look
at
the
contradictions
of
her
evidence,
i
think
the
united
states
attorney's
office
just
decided
that
this
would
be
a
very
difficult
case
to
prosecute.
i
think
i
would
like
to
draw
finally
the
attention
to
the
differences
in
exclusion
and
deportation
proceedings
and
the
particular
prejudices
to
mrs.
plasencia
in
this
case.
we
have
already
talked
about
the
stay
of
deportation,
the
notice
of
charges.
the
continuances
that
are
granted
regularly
in
deportation
proceedings,
i
think,
are
crucial.
an
immigration
attorney
must
in
fact
prepare
seven,
ten,
twelve,
fifteen
weeks,
sometimes,
for
a
case
such
as
this,
to
be
ready
to
argue
it,
and
i
would
like
to
ask
this
court
to
find
that
mrs.
plasencia
will
be
held
in
deportation
proceedings,
and
that
it
will
be
the
obligation
of
the
government
to
prove
her
deportability,
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
not
overturn
chew
v.
colding.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
your
honor,
we
are
arguing--
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
--i
feel...
that
is
my
position,
if
we
are
asking
for
an
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
well,
certainly
not.
certainly
not.
i
would
agree
with
you
that
she
does
not
want
to
be
held
in
deportation
proceedings,
but
we
are
asking
for
an
affirmance
of
the
lower
court's
determination.
we
feel
that
is
our
obligation.
thank
you.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions.
mr.
gary
h.
manulkin
thank
you.
