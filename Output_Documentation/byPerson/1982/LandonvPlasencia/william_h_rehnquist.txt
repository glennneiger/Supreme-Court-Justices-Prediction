justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schulder,
kwong
hai
chew
just
construed
a
regulation,
didn't
it?
it
didn't
involve
any
constitutional
holding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
language
in
knauff
versus
shaughnessy,
that
whatever
the
procedure
authorized
by
congress
is,
it
is
due
process
so
far
as
an
alien
denied
entry
is
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
certainly
didn't
hold
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
circuit
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
can
overrule
the
knauff
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
naturally,
any
procedure
contrary
to
the
due
process
would
be
struck
down
under
the
due
process
clause,
but
knauff
says
whatever
procedure
congress
provides
is
due
process.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
she
raise
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
chew
had
simply
taken
passage
on
an
american
ship,
hadn't
he?
he
hadn't
deliberately
left
the
country
the
way
your
client
had.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
on
an
american
ship.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
didn't
deliberately
leave
for
foreign
soil,
the
way
your
client
did.
and
he
didn't
bring
back
illegal
aliens,
either,
did
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
that
shows
is
that
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
agrees
with
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
chew
was
actually
decided
prior
to
the
immigration
act
of
1952,
when
the
congress
codified
all
of
these
immigration
policies.
the
concept
of
entry
before
1952
was
purely
a
judicial
one.
it
was
codified
in
1952.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it
didn't
purport
to
construe
the
1952
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
chew
when
the
1952
act
wasn't
before
the
court,
attempted
to
cast
doubt
on
the
1952
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
chew
also
simply
construed
a
regulation.
it
didn't
make
any
holding
on
any
constitutional
issue.
when
did
it
construe
the
1952
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
footnote
discusses
it
in
two
sentences.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
in
the
long
discourse
which
you
are
suggesting.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
chew
contain
the
statement
that
all
we
are
doing
is
construing
this
regulation
and
saying
it
wasn't
authorized
by
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
it
quite
successfully
limited
it.
i
don't
think
justice
bergman
was
incapable
of
limiting
an
opinion
like
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here,
the
statute
clearly
authorizes
what
was
done,
and
in
chew
they
simply
held
the
statute
didn't
authorize
what
was
done.
