we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
hensley
against
eckerhart.
mr.
boicourt,
i
think
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
cover
frivolous
claims
made
if
they
showed
they
spent
the
time
on
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
anyone
looking
at
the
record
of
the
time
identify
accurately
the
items
for
which
you
say
no
fee
should
be
allowed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand
you
to
say
you
are
not
limiting
this
to
frivolous
claims,
that
your
emphasis
is
on
successful
claims.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
claims
on
which
relief
was
granted.
chief
justice

mr.
eichner,
let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify
some
of
these
things
for
myself
with
a
hypothetical.
this
extends
the
question
justice
white
was
just
putting.
suppose
you
have
a
hypothetical
case
with
three
claims,
and
two
of
them
are
successful
and
one
isn't,
and
the
time
records
which
most
lawyers
keep
and
all
lawyers
should
keep
if
they
want
to
get
paid
show
that
the
time
was
spent
about
equally
on
the
three,
just
to
make
the
arithmetic
simple
here.
in
your
view,
are
the
lawyers
entitled
to
recover
on
the
ones
on
which
they
did
not
prevail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
assume
at
least,
whether
they
are
totally
separate
or
not,
that
they
are
readily
identifiable,
or
not
readily,
but
reasonably
identifiable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
help
it
out
by
saying
the
complaint
has
count
1,
count
2,
count
3,
and
that
their
interrelationship
is
limited
to
the
fact
that
they
involve
the
same
people
and
the
same
institutions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
eichner.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
boicourt?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
