mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
as
oral
argument
is
presented
in
this
case
today,
the
litigation
is
in
its
tenth
year.
the
only
issue
remaining
for
resolution
before
this
court
is
one
involving
the
attorneys'
fees
awarded
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
case
will
require
an
interpretation
and
application
of
the
civil
rights
attorneys'
fees
awards
act
of
1976,
title
42,
section
1988.
on
behalf
of
petitioners,
i
urge
the
court
to
adopt
the
principle
that
award
of
attorneys'
fees
under
the
statute
should
fairly
and
accurately
reflect
the
extent
to
which
a
plaintiff
has
prevailed
on
the
substantial
claims
in
his
case.
i
ask
the
court
to
accept
the
principle
that
the
attorneys'
fees
award
act
does
not
compensate
a
plaintiff
in
a
civil
rights
case
for
his
failures,
and
it
does
not
penalize
a
defendant
in
a
civil
rights
case
for
his
substantial
successes.
on
the
facts,
the
district
court
approved
in
this
case
an
attorneys'
fee
award
of
over
$133,000.
that
represented
2,557
principal
hours
as
found
by
the
trial
court.
again,
that
award
was
affirmed
per
curium
by
the
court
of
appeals.
no
attempt
was
made
by
the
district
court
to
proportion
the
fee
to
reflect
the
extent
to
which
the
plaintiff
succeeded
on
claims
and
the
extent
to
which
the
defendants
successfully
defended,
in
effect,
demonstrating
that
no
constitutional
deprivation
had
occurred
with
respect
to
certain
claims
in
the
lawsuit.
the
district
court
itself
found
in
its
opinion
relating
to
fees
that
the
defendants
did
prevail
on
some
of
the
issues.
nevertheless,
it
awarded
in
practical
effect
fees
for
every
hour
spent
by
plaintiff's
attorneys
on
the
case
without
respect
to
whether
they
prevailed
or
lost
on
specific
issues.
this
case
involved
a
comprehensive--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
were
a
few
claims
in
this
case
that
because
they
were
not
abandoned
prior
to
trial
had
become
close
to
being
frivolous
by
being
presented
in
the
courtroom.
there
were
other
claims
in
the
case
which
were
unsuccessful
which
i
do
not
claim
to
you
were
frivolous.
nevertheless,
they
were
unsuccessful.
and
congress
provided
fees
for
prevailing
civil
rights
litigants,
not
fees
for
merely
asserting
a
civil
rights
claim.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
by
the
time
they
got
to
the
point
in
the
lawsuit
where
they
were
trying
to
prove
that
defendants
over-relied
upon
medication
in
controlling
the
patients
in
the
forensic
unit,
that
had
become
frivolous,
because
their
own
experts,
all
of
whom
had
been
contacted,
employed
some
years
in
advance
of
the
case,
did
not
support
the
claim.
they
all
came
to
the
courtroom
and
testified
there
was
no
evidence
of
overmedication
of
patients.
i
think
their
failure
to
abandon
that
was
frivolous.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i
think
with
respect
to
the
mail
policy,
the
fact
that
the
mail
policy
of
the
forensic
unit
was
amended
in
1977...
that
was
during
the
duration
of
the
lawsuit.
there
was
also
some
contemporary
eighth
circuit
precedent
which
dealt
with
mail
issues
in
the
prison
context.
i
think
their
failure
to
have
abandoned
that
claim
and
to
have
presented
it
at
trial
when
it
was
clearly...
the
mail
policy
was
consistent
with
what
was
being
done--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--well,
with
respect
to
a
couple
of
those
issues,
i
think
they
become
frivolous
by
the
time
the
trial
occurred.
i
am
not
taking
the
position
that--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--that
is
my
position.
i
would
think
they
would,
because
many
of
these
experts,
again,
had
been
retained
some
years
in
advance
of
trial.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
the
district
court
accepted
a
voluntary
dismissal
after
a
substantial
number
of
hours
had
been
spent
by
both
sides.
plaintiffs,
i
think,
have
suggested
in
their
brief
that
their
lawsuit
had
something
to
do
with
some
voluntary
action
on
the
part
of
the
defendants,
but
in
real
point
of
the
fact,
that
motion
for
voluntary
dismissal
came
very
close
after
this
court's
decision
in
national
league
of
cities
versus
yuser.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
didn't
apply
to
states.
again,
this
lawsuit
involved
a
multi-claim
attack
on
the
forensic
unit,
fulton
state
hospital.
now,
as
that
name
implies,
the
forensic
unit
is
a
mental
institution
designed
to
provide
care
and
treatment
to
dangerous
mental
patients,
patients
who
for
the
most
part
have
been
involuntarily
committed--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--i
think
because--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--i
think
he
should.
he
has
the
burden
of
proof,
just
like
any--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
that
will
often
occur,
and
i
think--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--i
have
not
seen
any
books
like
that
in
the
eighth
circuit,
because
he's
going
to
get
compensated
no
matter
what
he
spent
his
time
on.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i
think
they
should
be
required
as
a
general
matter
to
indicate
what
specific
area
of
their
lawsuit
time
is
being
expended
on
as
they
keep
their
records.
it
is
pretty
easy
to
devote
a
sentence
or
a
short
clause
to
saying,
preparing
an
expert
for
testimony
on
staff
matters,
and
saying,
researching
the
matter
of
the
mail
policy.
i
don't
think
that's
an
unreasonable
burden.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i
think
he
looked
pretty
closely
to
the
records,
your
honor,
but
it
was
in
the
context
of
his
attempting
to
follow
a
previous
eighth
circuit
precedent
which
he
believed
foreclosed
him
from
reducing
the
fee
because
of
unsuccessful
claims.
i
think
that
was
more
addressed
to
the
matter
of
duplication
of
effort
among
counsel.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
well,
i
think
when
he
addressed
that
issue
he
cited
directly
language
from
opinions
out
of
the
eighth
circuit,
and
somewhat
dissimilar
cases,
but
the
language
clearly
indicated
a
position
of
the
eighth
circuit
that
all
hours
were
to
be
compensated,
and
i
believe
that
the
opinion
read
as
a
whole
indicates
that
he
was
following
that
precedent.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i
think
it's
a
fair
reading
in
this
regard,
your
honor.
what
the
judge
did,
it
is
very
clear
from
the
entire
record
of
this
case
that
there
were
failures,
substantial
failures
on
behalf
of
plaintiff's
attorneys,
but
once
that
one
reduction
was
made
for
one
attorney
who
was
inexperienced,
all
hours
claimed,
every
hour
claimed
that
was
requested
was
compensated,
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
in
any
way
the
extent
to
which
successful
claims
on
behalf
of
defendants
should
have
been
taken
into
account.
he
in
effect
rejected
the
theory
which
i
presented
to
him,
i
think,
because
of
the
eighth
circuit
precedent
which
he
followed.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
the
most
clear
eighth
circuit
precedent
is
brown
versus
bathke,
which
involves
what
i
think
creates
a
distinction
which
should
be
made.
brown
versus
bathke
has
language
of
apparently
very
adverse
character
to
our
position,
but
it
involved
an
alternative
legal
theory
case
as
opposed
to
a
multiple
claim
case.
that
is,
several
different
legal
theories
of
recovery
all
in
support
of
a
common
form
of
relief.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
again
with
respect
to
the
issues
which
were
litigated
in
the
case,
pursuant
to
local
rules,
counsel
on
the
morning
the
trial
of
this
case
began
agreed
there
were
24
issues,
substantial
claims
which
remained
to
be
litigated
in
the
case.
i
will
freely
admit
with
respect
to
some
of
those
24
claims
that
they
were
related,
cannot
be
substantially
distinguished.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
what
i
was
attempting
to
do,
your
honor,
is
demonstrate...
i
think
on
the
face
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
on
the
merits,
the
district
court,
it
is
clear
that
there
were
some
substantial
failures.
it
is
made
even
more
clear
by
the
pretrial
order
filed
on
the
day
before
the
case
began,
because
in
many
instances
the
court
did
not
take
up
or
consider
its
opinion
on
the
merits.
certain
claims
which
were
made
and
proof
were
offered
on
those
claims
at
trial,
and
the
court
just
ignored
them
in
its
opinion.
i
think
that
demonstrates
the
plaintiffs
failed
to
prevail
on
those
particular
claims
and
that
their
time
should
be
discounted.
now,
with
respect
to
these
24
claims,
and
again,
some
of
them
were
related,
most
of
them,
i
submit,
were
not,
the
court
ordered
relief
on
six.
i
believe
that
each
of
these
claims
or
the
vast
majority
of
these
claims
were
truly
separable,
fractionable,
that
they
would
have
served
as
an
independent
basis
for
a
one-issue
lawsuit.
for
the
claims
that
lost,
that
would
have
been
an
unsuccessful
one-issue
lawsuit,
and
no
attorneys'
fees
under
any
interpretation
of
the
statute
can
be
awarded
to
a
party
who
does
not
prevail
at
all.
the
principle
which
i
am
trying
to
get
the
court
to
adopt
i
think
is
consistent
with
sound
public
policy.
fee
shifting
makes
sense
only
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
civil
rights.
only
when
it
is
found
that
a
defendant
has
deprived
another
person
of
a
civil
right
should
he
be
required
to
pay
his
opponent's
counsel
for
substantiating
that
claim.
there
is
no
question
that
the
civil
rights
attorneys'
fees
award
act
was
intended
as
an
inducement
to
civil
rights
litigation.
i
assume
that
my
opponent
will
argue
at
great
length
this
afternoon
that
the
theory
that
the
petitioners
espouse
would
deter
civil
rights
litigation,
but
the
awards
act,
the
fees
act
will
encourage
exactly
that
kind
of
litigation
which
it
rewards.
if
the
merit
of
a
claim
is
not
going
to
be
the
key
factor
in
a
judicial
determination
as
to
whether
fees
should
be
rewarded...
awarded
for
time
spent
establishing
that
claim,
then
i
submit
to
you
that
the
merit
of
the
claim
will
not
be
the
key
factor
in
the
decision
of
counsel
whether
to
include
that
claim
in
his
original
litigation
or
whether
to
abandon
that
claim
in
an
attempt
to
narrow
the
scope
of
his
lawsuit
before
it
comes
to
trial.
as
a
result--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--yes,
i
believe
they
can,
your
honor.
if
the
burden
of
proof
is
carried
by
plaintiff's
counsel
and
his
lawsuit
that
has
served
as
a
catalyst
to
voluntary
action
by
defendants,
i
think
the
time
reasonably
expended
to
accomplish
that
voluntary
action
should
be
compensated,
but
only
that
time
reasonably
expended
up
until
the
voluntary
action
took
place.
if
he
continues
to
litigate
that
claim
after
the
voluntary
action
and
up
through
the
end
of
trial,
the
end
of
the
litigation,
the
time
after
that
voluntary
action
takes
place
should
not
be
compensated.
i
submit
that
the
rule
in
the
eighth
circuit
which
in
effect
results
in
all
hours
being
compensated
regardless
of
the
relative
success
of
the
parties
in
the
various
claims
at
issue
would
and
does
create
an
imposition
on
the
courts.
it
must
encourage
frivolous
pleading
and
congested
court
dockets.
one
of
the
most
important
functions
of
a
district
court
judge
is
to
narrow
the
scope
of
litigation
in
front
of
him,
to
get
the
parties
to
agree
to
make
the
case
as
workable
and
as
presentable
in
the
courtroom
as
is
possible.
there
is
no
incentive
for
a
civil
rights
litigant
in
the
eighth
circuit
to
narrow
the
scope
of
his
issues,
because
he
will
be
rewarded
for
all
time
expended
on
the
case,
regardless
of
how
many
unmeritorious,
unsuccessful
issues
are
included
in
his
case.
i
think
that
frustrates
the
ability
of
the
trial
judge
to
effect
a
narrowing
of
the
issues,
to
make
case
workable...
make
cases
workable,
and--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
decision
of
the
judge
that
says
that.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
were
some
issues
that
at
the
time
of
trial
had
become
frivolous.
i
don't
take
the
position
that
because
issues
are
not
frivolous,
are
of
substance,
that
that
would
change
my
position,
that
the
act
requires
or
provides
for
compensation
for
prevailing,
for
winning.
even
if
the
issues
were
not
frivolous,
were
substantial,
but
he
lost,
he
still
should
not
be
paid
for
his
time
spent
on
it.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
sir.
the
judge
said
that
some
issues
were
won
by
plaintiffs
and
some
issues
were
won
by
defendants,
and
he
paid
them
for
all
their
hours.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
no,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
expect
the
trial
judge
to
say
that.
he
doesn't
intend
to
be
reversed.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i
think
in
this
particular
case
because
time
records
were
not
kept
which
were
in
any
way
related
to
various
claims
of
the
course
of
the
lawsuit,
it
would
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
do
that
except
the
trial
judge.
that
is
why
i
don't
ask
this
court
to
find
what
a
reasonable
fee
should
be
in
the
case,
or
determine
how
many
issues
i
won
and
how
many
issues
my
opponents
won.
i
ask
that
the
case
be
remanded
so
the
district
court
can
do
that,
that
he
had
control
of
the
case
throughout
the
entire
years
of
this
litigation--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--yes,
your
honor,
there
has.
that
is
one
reason
why
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
some
position
be
taken
by
this
court.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
well,
that's
interesting.
including
the
eighth
circuit,
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuits
have
a
line
of
cases
with
language
very
similar
to
the
eighth
circuit,
contrary
to
my
position.
with
respect
to
four
circuits,
different
panels
within
the
circuit
have
disagreed
on
the
issue
on
their
face,
but
within
the
circuit
there
are
conflicts.
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
four
others,
the
cases
support
my
position.
this
is
a
classic
example
of
a
true
split
in
the
circuits.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor.
the
preponderance
of
the
total
number
of
cases
support
my
position,
that
attorneys'
fees
are
not
to
be
awarded
for
unsuccessful
claims,
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
trial
court
to
determine
how
successful
the
litigants
were
and
to
fashion
an
award
which
fairly
reflects
that
success.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
the
case.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
successful--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
my...
i
don't
want
to
give
the
impression
my
argument
rises
or
falls
with
respect
to
whether
a
particular
claim
was
frivolous.
that
is
not
my
point
at
all.
it
is
whether
or
not
it
was
successful,
because
the
fees
act
rewards
prevailing
civil
rights
litigants.
it
does
not
reward
someone
merely
for
asserting
a
civil
rights
claim.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
if
he
gives
up
completely
with
respect
to
all
claims,
yes.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
if
the--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--any
time
remedial
action,
whether
ordered
by
the
court
or
voluntary
on
behalf
of
defendant
is
the
direct
result
of
the
lawsuit,
the
hours
expended
in
establishing
that
relief
should
be
compensated.
i
don't
argue
that
position.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
well,
that
is--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--yes,
if
the
preparation
was
reasonably
related
to
the
matter
of
their
successes,
i
would
allow
the
compensation.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
not
if
they
lost,
no.
in
this
case,
they
substantially
lost.
they
lost
a
lot
more
than
they
won,
and
i
don't
see
why
my
client
should
pay
their
attorneys
for
unsuccessfully
suing
them.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
yes,
as
it
is
implied
for
a
multiple
claim
case.
yes,
your
honor.
and
again--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--that
is
correct
in
the
multiple
claim
case.
conscientiousness
is
not
to
be
rewarded.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
and
again,
that
case
involves
the
alternative
legal
theory
situation.
that
is,
more
than
one
theory
or
cause
of
action
in
support
of
common
relief.
so
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
the
distinction
be
made
between
that
and
this
multiple
claim
lawsuit,
in
which
the
relief
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
issue
itself
and
the
nature
of
the
claim.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
that
would
not
be
the
case
only
if
the
plaintiff
could
demonstrate
his
burden
of
proof
that
the
time
spent
was
reasonably
related
to
securing
the
actual
relief
awarded.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
in
the
multiple
claim
situation,
yes,
your
honor.
again,
that
was
an
alternative
legal
theory
case,
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
type
of
circumstances
we
have
here.
not
only
is
the
eighth
circuit
rule
an
imposition
on
the
courts
that
will
lead
to
more
court
congestion.
it
is
an
imposition
on
the
resources
of
defendants.
if
there
is
no
incentive
for
the
plaintiff's
attorney
to
narrow
the
scope
of
his
litigation
when
pled
or
when
prepared
for
trial,
the
defendant
in
civil
rights
litigation,
the
institutions,
the
programs,
the
statutes
that
get
sued
in
this
type
of
litigation,
have
to
expend
vast
amounts
of
resources
to
defend
these
cases
in
the
courtroom.
it
is
very
hard
to
negotiate
claims
when
the
plaintiff's
attorney
knows
that
all
hours
he
expends
on
his
total
case
are
going
to
be
compensated,
regardless
of
his
success
on
individual
claims.
the
shotgun
approach
to
lawsuit
is
a
drain
on
the
resources
of
states
and
other
types
of
people
that
have
to
defend
these
types
of
lawsuits.
the
parameters
of
civil
rights
litigation
must
not
be
contained
solely
within
the
imagination
of
a
plaintiff's
attorney.
there
must
be
some
other
control
over
that
litigation,
and
if
these
are
going
to
be
awarded
for
all
hours,
who
is
going
to
exercise
the
control?
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
trial
judge
to
narrow
that
case
because
there
is
no
incentive
for
the
plaintiff's
attorney
to
do
so.
in
addition,
attorneys'
fees
do
cause
a
penalty
to
be
levied
against
defendants.
i
think
that
was
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
the
attorneys'
fees
award
act,
and
in
the
context
of
other
attorneys'
fees
provisions
this
court
has
found
that
congress
intended
to
penalize
defendants
who
deprive
others
of
their
civil
rights.
but
when
a
claim
is
successfully
defended,
when
there
is
found
to
have
been
no
deprivation
of
anyone's
civil
rights,
why
should
the
defendant
be
required
to
accept
the
burden
of
his
adversary's
fees?
that
is
not
consistent
with
that
purpose.
otherwise,
the
prevailing
party
language
of
the
statute
means
nothing.
now,
again
in
this
case
there
were
truly
fractionable
claims,
claims
that
could
have
been
one-issue
lawsuits
which
were
unsuccessful.
for
example,
a
one-claim
lawsuit
on
the
validity
of
the
defendant's
mail
policy
would
have
been
unsuccessful.
no
fees.
a
one-issue
lawsuit
on
the
claim
that
defendants
overmedicated
their
patients
would
have
been
unsuccessful.
no
fee.
an
unsuccessful
lawsuit
on
the
claim
that
defendant's
staff
was
constitutionally
inadequate
would
have
been
unsuccessful.
why
should
a
fee
attach
to
these
totally
unsuccessful
constitutional
claims
merely
because
they
were
under
the
umbrella
of
a
lawsuit
which
included
some
other
claims
which
resulted
in
limited
relief
being
afforded?
it
is
an
inequitable
result.
in
addition,
the
statute
requires
the
exercise
of
discretion.
it
says
a
court
may
in
its
discretion
award
to
the
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
under
the
eighth
circuit
rule,
there
is
no
discretion.
if
all
that
must
be
shown
is
that
one
claim
was
successful,
then
all
hours
will
be
compensated
at
the
prevailing
hourly
rate.
where
is
there
room
for
the
trial
judge
to
use
his
discretion?
where
is
there
authority
for
him
to
fashion
an
award
which
is
fair
to
all
parties,
and
reflects
the
extent
to
which
a
plaintiff
actually
demonstrated--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--i
think
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
for
him
to
award
a
claim--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--excuse
me.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
but
that
is
where
he
can
actually
exercise
his
discretion
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
unless
he
can
show
that
the
hours
spent--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--were
reasonably
related
to
the
actual
relief
ultimately
granted--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
possible
for
them
to
claim,
yes,
that
their
proof
or
that
their
time
expended
on
the
mail
policy
had
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
privacy--
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
--that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i'm
not
sure
i
really
researched
that
subject.
i
have
been
looking
at
counsel
fees
in
civil
rights
cases.
mr.
michael
l.
boicourt
i
want
to
briefly
discuss
the
matter
of
legislative
history
which
has
been
discussed
by
my
opponent
this
morning.
congress
established
or
set
forth,
said
it
was
passing
section
1988
for
two
purposes,
to
attract
competent
counsel
to
civil
rights
litigation
and
to
avoid
windfalls
to
attorneys.
now,
competent
counsel
hopefully
will
competently
plead
and
competently
narrow
the
scope
of
their
litigation
before
it
gets
into
the
courtroom.
the
act
has
secured
that
purpose.
counsel
are
being
attracted.
before
1976,
there
was
no
provision
for
shifting
of
fees.
more
importantly
is
the
matter
of
windfalls
to
attorneys.
i
submit
that
an
attorney
who
tries
to
establish
a
civil
rights
claim
and
fails
does
not
succeed,
loses.
the
result
is
the
court...
or
the
defendant
is
vindicated
with
respect
to
that
claim.
if
he
is
compensated
for
his
hours
spent
on
that
claim,
he
is
receiving
a
windfall,
and
congress
said
that
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
avoid.
we
also
discussed
the
language
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
counsel
for
a
prevailing
party
should
be
paid
is
traditional
with
attorneys
compensated
by
a
fee-paying
client.
now,
in
the
first
place,
it
says
for
a
prevailing
party,
and
my
position
obviously
is
that
first
you
have
to
prevail
on
the
claim
to
be
a
prevailing
party
for
attorneys'
fees
purposes,
but
the
same
argument
was
presented
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
copeland
versus
marshall,
and
their
response
was,
and
i
quote,
"it
does
not
follow
that
the
amount
of
time
actually
expended
is
the
amount
of
time
reasonably
expended.
"
"in
the
private
sector
billing
judgment
is
an
important
component
in
fee
setting.
"
that
court
concluded
that
time
spent
on
non-prevailing
claims
should
not
be
compensated.
