justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
dismissal
of
count
2
of
the
original
complaint?
the
one
that
claimed
that
the
forced
performance
of
work
if
it
had
no
therapeutic
value
violated
the
thirteenth
amendment
prohibition
against
involuntary
servitude.
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
accepted
a
voluntary
dismissal
on
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
count
2
of
the
original
complaint,
the
involuntary
servitude
count?
would
you
say
that
that
was
in
the
severable
category
with
respect
to
the
other
counts
of
the
complaint,
or
do
you
think
that
was
part
of
your
overall
umbrella?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says...
at
least
where
i
am
looking
at
the
joint
appendix
on
page
4,
it
says
count
2.
perhaps
there
is
a--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
here
you
received
some
compensation
for
work
on
count
2,
did
you
not?
i
am
referring
to
page
228
of
the
joint
appendix.
there
is
an
entry
for
may
29th,
'75,
research
and
drafting
of
plaintiff's
memorandum
of
law
on
the
applicability
of
the
eleventh
amendment
to
plaintiff's
claim
for
damages
in
count
2.
i
merely
raise
the
question,
there
are
several
complaints
in
the
joint
appendix.
at
least
three.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
agree
that
was
severable,
and
you
took
a
voluntary
dismissal
of
it,
how
under
your
own
theory
of
how
the
fee
statute
should
be
administered
were
you
entitled
to
be
paid
for
that
particular
item
of
work?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
eichner,
what
was
it
you
were
awarded
in
this
case,
something
like
$130,000?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if,
as
justice
powell
has
hypothesized,
the
defendant
agreed
to
do,
right
after
you
had
filed
the
complaint
and
the
memorandum
of
authorities
in
opposition
to
a
summary
judgment,
because
the
counsel
for
the
state
was
so
impressed
by
your
arguments,
he
said,
well,
i'll
give
you
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
which
turns
out
to
be
exactly
what
you
ultimately
got
after
years
of
litigation?
wouldn't
you
be
entitled
to
something
more
than
just
hours
spent,
if,
kind
of
in
a
rather
dramatic
legal
move,
you
get
a
whole
lot
without
spending
a
lot
of
time?
