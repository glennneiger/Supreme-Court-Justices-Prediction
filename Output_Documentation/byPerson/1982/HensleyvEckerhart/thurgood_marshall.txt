justice
thurgood
marshall
excuse
me,
counsel.
one
point
before
that.
would
you
have
the
lawyer...
wouldn't
he
have
to
keep
books
saying
that
today
at
ten
minutes
after
2:00
i
am
working
on
point
3
of
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
he
have
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
thought.
well,
wouldn't
he
spend
all
of
his
time
bookkeeping?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
while
he's
working
on
point
2
he
finds
an
answer
to
point
3?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
have
to
keep
books
on
that.
have
you
ever
seen
any
books
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
have
you
seen
any
books
that
lawyers
keep
that
they
are
working
on
point
1
of
section
c
of
point
3
in
the
brief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
this
judge's
opinion
that
said
he
paid
him
for
working
on
frivolous
matters?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
do
you
get
your
basis
for
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
judge
say
he
paid
them
for
the
lost
ones?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
question
was,
did
the
judge
say,
i
am
paying
you
for
the
lost
ones?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
you
say
the
position
is
that
if
somebody
claims
they
denied
their
civil
rights,
and
they
bring
a
lawsuit,
and
the
other
side
gives
in
immediately?
would
that
be
a
successful
lawsuit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
completely
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
if
he
goes
to
trial,
then
you
have
to
prorate
it.
but
if
he
gives
up
up
front,
you
don't
prorate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
i
am
warning
you,
my
next
question
is,
if
you
give
up
halfway
through,
will
you
split
it
in
half?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
know
it
is
brought
on
by
the
lawsuit
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
seen
cases
settled
on
the
day
of
trial
that
have
been
in
preparation
for
six
years.
you
would
allow
them
to
receive
fees
for
their
preparation
even
if
you
didn't
go
to
trial,
would
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
wouldn't
after
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
a
question
that
is
tangential.
i
don't
think
it
matters
to
the
case.
did
you
find
out
in
the
regular
equity
cases
in
state
or
federal
courts
any
instance
where
counsel
fees
were
questioned
on
appeal?
not
in
a
civil
rights
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
right.
i
was
just
wondering.
it
doesn't
matter
at
all
to
me.
