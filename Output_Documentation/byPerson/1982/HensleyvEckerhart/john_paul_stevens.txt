justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
district
judge
did
find...
i
don't
know
just
what
he
did,
but
he
said,
"after
a
close
review
of
the
detailed
time
records
of
these
two
attorneys
and
an
opportunity
to
review
the
work
of
both
attorneys,
the
court
concluded
that
the
amount
of
time
spent
by
mr.
berkowitz
and
mr.
bastian
both
in
trial
and
in
non-trial
activities
is
reasonable
and
their
efforts
are
not
duplicative
of
others.
"
doesn't
that
kind
of...
i
don't
know
what
the
judge
did,
but
doesn't
it
indicate
he
did
look
pretty
closely
at
what
their
time
had
been
spent
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
he
say
that
he
didn't
think
he
had
the
authority
to
reduce
it?
he
didn't
give
any
enhancement,
and
he
did
chop
off
about
300
hours
of
the
youngest
lawyer
in
the
group.
is
there
anything
in
his
opinion
that
says
he
thought
he
didn't
have
the
power
to
chop
off
a
pert
of
the
fees
if
he
thought...
you
know,
it
was
basically
unsuccessful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
read
its,
and
i
just
didn't
get
that
out
of
it,
to
be
honest
with
you,
that
he
was
under
the
impression
the
eighth
circuit
required
compensation
for
all
hours
regardless
of
how
useless
the
lawyer's
time
might
have
been.
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any...
what
is
the
eighth
circuit
precedent
that
most
clearly
states
what
you
say
their
view
of
the
law
is
on
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
i
think
you'd
have
a
stronger...
i
would
understand
that
as
a
stronger...
but
does
he
cite
that
case,
the
district
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
he
does,
i
see,
on
page
a-11.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
i
have
got
the
brown
opinion
in
front
of
me.
i
notice
the
eighth
circuit
does
say
that
the
issues
which
are
clearly
frivolous,
that
are
manufactured,
do
not
represent
time
which
has
been
reasonably
expended
on
a
matter,
and
thus
any
time
claimed
for
them
can
be
properly
disregarded
by
the
court.
so
that
is
the
rule
of
the
eighth
circuit.
you
disregard
time
spent
on
frivolous
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
question
that.
but
than
i
gather
this
is
the
sentence
that
you
take
issue
with.
"attorneys'
fees
for
a
claim
which
is
reasonably
calculated
to
advance
a
client's
interest
should
not,
however,
be
denied
solely
because
that
claim
did
not
provide
the
precise
basis
for
the
relief
granted.
"
that
is
what
you
want
us
to
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
it
was
a
reasonable...
the
reasonable
work
of
a
lawyer
who
was
conscientiously
trying
to
represent
his
client,
for
which
he
would
normally
be
paid
by
a
private
client.
you
would
say
he
should
not
be
paid
in
the
civil
rights
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
test
is
reasonably
calculated
to
advance
a
client's
interests.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
court
says
it
should
not
be
denied
solely
because
that
claim
did
not
provide
the
precise
basis
for
the
relief
granted.
and
your
view
is
that
it
should
be
denied
solely
because
it
did
not
provide
the
precise
basis
for
the
relief
granted.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
my
question.
is
it
your
view
that
the
compensation
should
be
denied
solely
because
the
claim
did
not
provide
the
precise
basis
for
the
relief
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
eichner,
can
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question?
do
you
think
the
standard
that
the
district
judge
followed
in
this
case
or
one
who
follows
the
12
johnson
factors
is
any
different
from
the
standard
followed
in
fixing
fees,
say,
in
an
antitrust
case,
or
in
a
trust
case,
all
sorts
of
cases
where
courts
fix
fees?
do
you
think
this
is
a
special
standards,
or
is
this
just
the
regular
standard?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
that
the
award
given
in
this
case
was
more
liberal
than
would
have
been
appropriate
in
any
other
kind
of
litigation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
frankly
don't
see
much
difference
between
the
johnson
factors
and
factors
i
run
into
in
countless
other
situations.
