counsel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
will
put
an
easy
question
to
you
that
may
clarify
your
position.
assume
you
had
a
1983
suit
against
prison
officials,
and
the
complaints
alleged
were
that
there
was
double
bunking
and
that
the
law
library
was
inefficient.
you
won
on
one
of
those
issues.
you
submitted
a
bill
based
on
1,000
hours.
should
there
be
any
apportionment
or
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
have
you
read
our
opinion
on
romeo
last
term?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
the
lawyers
in
that
case
should
win
100
percent
on
everything
they
claimed?
they
lost
on
their
major
contention
in
this
court.
i
think
you
could
assume
they
did.
we
reversed
the
court
below
on
right
to
treatment.
they
won
on
some
issues.
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
it,
you
can
pass
that
up.
what
i
really
would
like
to
ask
you--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--do
you
want
to
answer
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
this
case,
you
requested
an
enhancement
fee
over
and
above
the
multiplication
results
that
hourly
rates
would
provide.
the
district
judge
did
not
allow
it.
would
you
view
that
as
a
two-way
street
so
that
hourly
charges
that
arguably
were
expended
reasonably
by
counsel
but
nevertheless
produced
a
poor
result
should
be
discounted?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
it
ought
to
go
only
up,
but
not
down?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--you
would
never
discount.
while
you
are
thinking
about
that,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
after
you
brought
this
lawsuit,
you
had
so
impressed
counsel
for
the
hospital
that
they
agreed
to
everything
you
requested
before
you
had
even
taken
discovery
depositions,
and
you
had
only
recorded
50
hours
of
time.
would
you
be
entitled
to...
suppose
you
charged
$200
an
hour.
that
is
$10,000,
i
think.
was
that
the
limit...
would
that
be
the
limit
of
your
fee?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
that
would
be
$10,000
in
this
case,
and
you've
won
a
victory
that
was
probably
worth
millions
of
dollars,
perhaps?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
are
saying
results
are
of
no
importance.
