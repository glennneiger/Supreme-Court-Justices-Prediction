mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
depends
on
whether
we
are
talking
about
a
situation
such
as
we
had
here,
where
there
was
one
overall
broad
claim,
that
is,
a
constitutional
right
to
treatment,
and
the
specific
aspects
under
that
broad
claim,
and
those
subparts
being
related
to
each
other
in
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
claim,
or
were
they
perhaps
three
totally
separate
claims
which
didn't
necessarily
relate
to
each
other.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
well,
i...
i
have
to
repeat
that
it
comes
back
to
what
extent
those
claims
relate
to
each
other
or
not.
if
they
were
three
separate
actions
that
could
have
been
brought
as
three
totally
separate
lawsuits,
and
the
work
involved
in
claims
1
and
2
wouldn't
necessarily
relate
to
the
preparation
and
preparing
of
claim
3,
then--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--well,
again,
it
is
going
to
be
a
factual
determination
by
the
district
court
to
what
extent
do
those
varying
claims
relate
to
each
other.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
that
was...
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
count
3,
which
was
the
uncompensated
labor,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
in
any
case,
the
uncompensated
labor
claim
was
a
separate
claim.
it
is
unlike
what
went
to
trial
in
this
lawsuit.
what
went
to
trial
in
this
lawsuit
was
count
3,
which
was
the
claim
that
plaintiff's
constitutional
right
to
treatment
was
being
violated,
and
then
within
that
claim
there
are
various
specific
subparts
and
aspects,
but
the
uncompensated
labor,
which,
by
the
way,
was
in
a
time
period
prior
to
when
we
are
seeking
fees
for,
would
be
considered
in
that
case
a
separate
claim.
the
mere
fact
that
it
had
as
its
subject
the
same
institution
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you
get
time
for
all
of
it.
it
really
ties
again,
coming
back
to
the
question
presented
by
the
chief
justice,
what
is
the
extent
of
interrelatedness
and
interconnectedness
between
the
various
claims.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
well,
the
specific
answer
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
is
yes,
there
was
time
on
the
uncompensated
labor
claim
which
was
after
1975.
we
didn't
ask
for
fees
prior
to
'75,
but
the
work
after
january,
'75,
we
sought
fees
for,
and
the
example
that
you
just
cited
was
work
which
we
sought
and
obtained.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
because
it
is
an
incorrect
understanding
that
we
were
wholly
unsuccessful
on
that.
we
obtained
minimally
catalytic
relief
on
that
claim.
there
were
two
parts
to
it.
one
was
the
injunctive
claim
which
sought
that
the
defendants
compensate
the
residents
of
fulton
state
hospital
for
labor,
and
that
was
effectuated
by
the
lawsuit.
there
was
a
second
part
which
was
the
back
wages
claim.
that
is
the
part
which
was
dismissed,
your
honor.
there
are
two
parts
to
it.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
yes.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
i
don't
wish
to
or
intend
to
duck
the
question,
but
quite
honestly,
i
am
unfamiliar
enough
with
prison
litigation
to
know
which...
how
much
those...
the
preparation,
trying,
and
litigating
of
those
claims
would
necessarily
relate
to
each
other,
and
i...
i
would
have
to
come
back
to,
that's
the
real
issue,
how
much
do
those
two
interrelate.
for
example,
in
this
lawsuit,
time
spent
on
the
overmedication
claim,
on
which
there
was
not
relief,
was
related
both
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
as
well
as
the
actual
trying
of
the
lawsuit
to
the
physical
environment,
where
we
obtained
significant
relief.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
your
honor--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--yes
and
no.
i
want
to
answer
it
in
that
the
analysis,
that
is,
the
answer
to
the
question...
congress
intended
a
two-part
analysis
determining
whether
or
not
a
person
is
entitled
to
a
fee.
the
first
part
is
a
determination
whether
or
not
they
are
prevailing
parties
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
once
you
find
that
the
party
is
a
prevailing
party,
there
is
a
separate
second
analysis,
so
in
the
romeo
case,
i
can't
answer
specifics
because
i'm
not
familiar
with
it
enough,
but
the
first
threshold
test
is
whether
or
not
there
are
prevailing
parties
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
prevailing
party
issue
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
it
was
not
appealed,
and
the
issue
is
whether...
what
time
is
reasonably
expended
in
this
lawsuits,
and
whether
the
district
court
awarded
the
all
time...
in
conformity
with
all
time
reasonably
expended
standard.
and
so
the
answer
to
the
question
in
romeo
would
be,
you
would
have
to
go
through
that
two-step
process.
one,
are
there
prevailing
parties,
and
two,
assuming
that
they
were,
you
would
exclude
compensation
for
time
which
was
in
bad
faith,
clearly
meritless,
or
three,
wholly
separable
or
distinguishable
that
they
in
no
way
contributed
to
the
ultimate
result
achieved.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
the
district
court
began
with
an
analysis
of
whether
or
not
plaintiffs
were
a
prevailing
party
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
yes,
implicitly,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--i
would
like
to
explain
the
answer
to
you,
which
is
that
in
the
portion
of
the
fee
decision
where
the
district
court
examined
the
amount
of
the
fee
after
finding
the
prevailing
party
issue,
the
district
court
said,
defendants
have
argued
for
a
mathematical
mechanical
approach,
which
fails
to
take
into
account
the
interrelatedness
and
interconnection
of
the
various
claims.
presumably--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--by--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--by
rejecting
an
approach
which
doesn't
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
claims
are
interrelated
and
interdependent,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
clear
that
the
court
was
doing...
was
finding
that
they
did
interrelate
and
interconnect.
the
issue
in
this
case,
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
district
court
complied
with
section
1980(a)
in
its
fee
award;
specifically,
whether
the
court
was
correct
when
it
analyzed
the
case
as
a
whole
and
looked
to
the
ultimate
results
achieved,
thus
rejecting
the
mechanical
and
mathematical
approach
urged
by
defendants.
resolution
of
that
question
involves
a
narrow
question
or
issue
of
statutory
construction.
that
undertaking
begins
with
the
statute
itself.
the
fees
act
is
a
broad
congressional
charter
authorizing
courts
to
award
a
prevailing
party
a
reasonable
attorneys'
fee
as
part
of
costs.
congress
accompanied
this
statute
with
a
substantial
legislative
history
consisting
of
both
the
senate
and
house
report,
both
of
which
have
been
authoritatively
cited
by
this
court.
in
the
context
of
attorneys'
fee
awards,
the
legislative
history
is
especially
instructive
in
light
of
this
court's
holding
in
alyeska
that
the
circumstances
under
which
attorneys'
fee
awards
are
to
be
awarded
and
the
range
of
discretion
of
courts
in
making
those
awards
are
matters
for
congress
to
determine.
congress...
in
the
legislative
history,
congress
anticipated
a
number
of
issues
which
would
accompany
a
fee
shifting
statute,
and
provided
specific
guidance
for
resolution
of
those
issues.
in
a
section
of
the
legislative
history
which
addresses
the
method
of
computing
the
amount
of
the
fee,
congress
explicitly
stated
what
the
proper
standard
was
to
be.
"in
computing
the
fee,
counsel
for
the
prevailing
party
should
be
compensated,
as
is
traditional
with
attorneys
for
fee-paying
clients,
for
all
time
reasonably
expended
on
a
matter.
"
congress
provided
further
direction
on
this
issue
by
stating
that
proper
fee
computation
had
taken
place
in
two
specific
cases,
the
davis
versus
county
of
los
angeles
case
and
the
stanford
daily
versus
zirker
case.
those
cases
established
that
the
all
time
reasonably
expended
standard
does
not
permit
apportioning
the
fee
award
to
only
winning
claims.
in
the
davis
case,
which
was
a
title
7
suit,
defendants
had
argued
for
a
proportional
fee
reduction.
the
court
specifically
held
it
was
not
legally
relevant
that
a
certain
amount
of
limited
time
and
effort
was
devoted
to
issues
which
were
either
not
litigated
or
upon
which
they
were
not
successful.
instead,
the
court
looked
to
the
ultimate
results
achieved,
and
found
that
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
fees
for
all
time
reasonably
expended.
in
the
stanford
daily
case,
the
court
similarly
disapproved
of
a
proportionality
analysis
and
rejected
defendant's
argument
that
there
should
be
a
reduction
in
fees
for
the
hours
expended
on
unsuccessful
work.
the
court
held
that
although
fees
were
to
be
denied
for
clearly
meritless
claims,
they
were
to
be
granted
for
legal
work
reasonably
calculated
to
advance
their
client's
interest.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
i
think
it
is
the
same
test,
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
the
proper
test
is
looking
at
the
case
as
a
whole
and
awarding
fees
for
all
time
reasonably
expended,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--what
i
said
is
that--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--once
somebody
is
found
to
be
a
prevailing
party,
they
are
entitled
for
all
time
reasonably
expended,
and
that
three-part
explanation
that
i
did
in
answer
to
your
question
was
what
goes
into
a
finding
of
what
time
is
reasonably
expended.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
yes.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
that--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--i
believe
the
district
court
found
that
the
reason
for
not
awarding
an
enhancement
factor
was
that
the
same
factors
and
considerations
as
the
johnson
factors
which
go
to
enhancement
were
already
taken
into
account
in
the
reasonable
fees,
so
that
there
was
no
reason
to
repeat
those
same
factors
and
award
upwards.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
this
case,
i
don't
believe
presents
the
issue
of
enhancement
of
fees.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
the
limit
of
the
fee
would
be
whatever
hourly
rate
you
were
asking
for
for
those
number
of
hours.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
yes,
because
it
relates
to...
the
method
of
awarding
fees
relates
to
the
number
of
hours,
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--the
results
are
important.
they
are
one
of
the
johnson
factors.
but
the
determination
of
reasonable
fee
is
tied
to
the
number
of
hours.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
$133,000,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
well,
i
come
back
to
the
same
point.
i
think
that
the
results
obtained
are
one
of
the
johnson
factors,
and
the
district
court
considered
that,
but
i
think
the
fee
is
generally
tied
to
the
number
of
hours.
congress's
citation
of
the
fee
computation
in
the
davis
case
and
stanford
daily
case
endorses
a
two-step
process
for
determining
reasonable
attorneys'
fees.
as
i
said
before,
first
is
whether
or
not
the
person
is
a
prevailing
party
or
not,
and
once
they
are
found
to
be
a
prevailing
party,
the
second
portion
of
that
two-step
process
is
a
look
at
the
case
as
a
whole
to
see
what
time
was
reasonably
expended.
now,
legal
sources
are
considered
reasonably
expended
unless
they
are
brought
in
bad
faith,
spent
on
clearly
meritless
claims,
or
devoted
to
claims
so
wholly
unrelated,
so
distinguishable
and
separable,
that
they
in
no
way
contributed
to
the
ultimate
result
achieved.
the
district
court's
fee
analysis
in
this
case
is
fully
consistent
with
the
standard
provided
by
the
act
and
the
legislative
history.
the
court
analyzed
whether
plaintiffs
were
a
prevailing
party,
and
found
that
based...
looking
just
at
the
court
order
of
relief,
there
was
substantial
enough
relief
to
find
that
plaintiffs
were
the
prevailing
party,
so
much
so
that
the
court
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
look
at
those
issues
which
were
mooted
prior
to
trial.
secondly--
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
--i
think
the
process
is
generally
the
same.
i
think
that
the
civil
rights
area
is
special
to
some
extent,
because
congress
has
singled
that
out
as
a
particularly
important
place
for
vigorous
enforcement
of
civil
rights,
and
found
that
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
was
particularly
tied
to
the
enforcement
of
civil
rights,
and
therefore
directed
the
courts
to
use
the
broadest
and
most
flexible
standards
to
ensure
the
enforcement
of
the
civil
rights.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
no,
i
don't
believe
that
the
award
in
this
case
was
more
liberal
at
all.
i
thought
you
were
asking
whether
it
is
generally
the
same.
mr.
stanley
j.
eichner
no,
there
is...
there
is
a
difference
of
views
within
the
circuits
between
the
so-called
johnson
factors
and
the
loadstar
analysis,
and
various
courts
have
been
critical
of
the
johnson
factors
because
they
find
them
not
that
precise
and
hard
to
work
with,
and
they
have
gone
to
a
loadstar
analysis.
that
issue
is
not
presented
in
this
case,
and
regardless
of
which
approach
you
use,
that
is,
whether
you
use
johnson
or
loadstar,
an
issue
which
needs
to
be
determined
prior
to
deciding
which
approach
is
going
to
be
the
determination
of
what
constitutes
compensable
hours,
and
that
is
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case,
and
that
needs
to
be...
that's
an
issue
which
must
be
decided
prior
to
employing
either
one
of
those
standards.
we
aren't
necessarily
arguing
for
the
johnson
factors
per
se.
we
would
suggest
that
that
is
one
permissible
approach.
it
is
the
factors
which
were
specifically
endorsed
in
the
legislative
history,
and
the
district
court's
employment
of
the
johnson
factors
was
correct.
it
was
not
incorrect.
after
the
district
court
had
resolved
the
prevailing
party
issue,
it
then
turned
to
the
amount
of
the
fee.
defendants
had
argued
for
an
automatic
across
the
board
reduction
in
fees,
suggesting
that
the
amount
of
the
fee
should
be
tied
to
the
amount
of
court-ordered
relief.
the
district
court
properly
rejected
those
suggestions,
finding
that
such
an
approach
was
improper
for
a
number
of
reasons,
that
it
was...
that
is,
it
was
incapable
of
giving
consideration
to
the
relative
importance
of
issues.
it
doesn't
address
the
interrelation
of
issues,
the
difficulty
of
identifying
issues,
nor
the
extent
of
prevailing
on
various
issues.
instead,
the
court
looked
to
the
johnson
factors
to
analyze
the
case
and
specifically
the
results
obtained
factor
of
johnson
to
analyze
the
ultimate
accomplishments
of
the
case
as
a
whole.
the
district
court
realized
that
in
the
seamless
fabric
of
those
accomplishments,
that
is,
vindication
of
plaintiff's
constitutional
rights,
and
substantial
changes
in
the
treatment
environment,
no
time
was
spent
on
clearly
meritless
or
unrelated
claims.
by
looking
at
the
case
as
a
whole
and
evaluating
the
claims
within
the
context
of
the
ultimate
results
achieved,
the
district
court
exercised
discretion
in
the
manner
intended
by
congress.
with
that
as
a
background,
let's
examine
what
the
results
were
of
this
lawsuit.
first
of
all,
plaintiffs
had
to
establish
that
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
treatment.
defendants
had
vigorously
fought
against
it,
arguing
that,
one,
there
was
no
such
a
right,
and
two,
to
the
extent
that
such
a
right
existed,
it
would
be
inapplicable
to
this
class
of
plaintiffs.
the
court
found
the
existence
of
such
a
right,
and
then
proceeded
to
analyze
the
six
aspects
of
the
treatment
environment
policies
and
conditions.
the
court
awarded
court
order
relief
on
five
out
of
six
aspects:
physical
environment;
individual
treatment
plans;
least
restrictive
environment;
visitation
and
telephone;
and
seclusion
and
restraint.
in
view
of
the
substantial
relief
that
plaintiffs
really
did
accomplish
in
this
lawsuit,
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
the
district
court
as
a...
found
that,
"the
significance
of
this
case
cannot
be
measured
in
dollars
and
cents.
"
"it
involves
constitutional
and
civil
rights
of
the
plaintiff
class,
and
resulted
in
a
number
of
changes
regarding
their
conditions
and
treatment
at
the
state
hospitals.
"
"not
only
should
plaintiffs
be
considered
prevailing
parties
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
they
are
parties
who
have
obtained
relief
of
significant
import.
"
"plaintiff's
relief
affects
not
only
them,
but
numerous
other
institutionalized
patients
similarly
situated.
"
it
is
also
important
to
point
out
that
not
only
is
the
proportionality
formula
unsupported
by
the
applicable
law,
but
it
discourages
precisely
the
zealous
representation
which
the
fees
act
seeks
and
the
code
of
professional
responsibility
requires.
as
pointed
out
and
argued
in
some
detail
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
american
bar
association,
under
the
code
of
professional
responsibility,
attorneys
are
required
to
represent
clients
zealously
within
the
law.
if
the
case
is
novel
or
complex,
it
is
difficult
to
predict
which
of
several
good
faith
arguments
plaintiffs
would
ultimately
prevail
upon,
and
therefore
to
represent
a
client
zealously
and
ethically,
counsel
must
explore
various
aspects
of
the
case,
develop
all
the
evidence,
and
present
supportable
issues
to
the
court.
to
reward
only
those
successful
claims

the
necessary
early
explanatory
stages
of
the
lawsuit,
invites
overly
conservative
tactics,
and
would
prohibit
high
risk
but
deserving
actions
entirely.
petitioner's
narrow
construction
penalizes
counsel
for
acting
in
conformity
with
the
canons
and
zealously
pursuing
the
client's
interests.
not
only
has
the
state
argued
for
an
unsupportable
standard,
they
have
also,
we
believe,
mischaracterized
some
of
the
facts
in
this
lawsuit.
over
and
over
again,
they
have
made
statements
that
plaintiffs
prevailed...
lost
on
more
things
than
they
won.
without
reciting
the
long
list
of
the
accomplishments,
i
would
simply
refer
the
court
to
the
chart
which
begins
on
page
25
of
our
brief,
which
analyzes
in
some
detail
the
claims
of
constitutional
violations
that
were
in
the
complaint,
and
then
compares
those
claims
with
the
relief
actually
ordered
by
the
court.
coming
back
to
the
ethical
issue
involved,
as
some
courts
have
noted,
it
hardly
furthers
the
mandate
to
use
the
broadest
and
most
flexible
remedies
available
to
us
to
enforce
the
civil
rights
law
if
we
so
directly
discourage
innovative
and
vigorous
delving
in
a
changing
area
of
the
law.
that
mandate
is
best
served
by
encouraging
attorneys
to
take
the
most
advantageous
position
they
can
that
is
possible
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
their
clients.
defendants
have
urged
adoption
of
what
they
call
a
standard
principle
to
guide
the
lower
courts
in
fashioning
fees
under
section
1988.
the
appropriate
standard
and
method
for
applying
the
fees
act
has
already
been
articulated
and
delineated
by
congress
in
the
act
and
its
legislative
history.
in
making
the
fee
award
in
this
case,
the
district
court
acted
in
consonance
with
the
standard
and
method
of
analysis
intended
by
congress.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
that
is
the
presentation.
