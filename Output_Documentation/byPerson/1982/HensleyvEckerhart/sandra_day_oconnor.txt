--should
we
really
look,
though,
at
the
ultimate
relief
sought
in
the
broad
terms
of
the
complaint,
or
at
a
pretrial
order
list
of
issues
in
seeing
if
the
attorneys'
fees
allowed
were
reasonable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
statute
prohibits
giving
attorneys'
fees
for
the
so-called
catalytic
results
if
the
lawsuit
is
filed
and
relates
to
several
claims,
and
before
it
comes
to
trial
the
defendants
change
the
practice,
and
it
isn't
necessary
to
go
to
trial
on
it?
under
the
statute,
can
attorneys'
fees
be
secured
for
those
results?
