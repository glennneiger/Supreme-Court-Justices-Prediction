justice
byron
r.
white
they
must
have
known
what
their
experts
were
going
to
testify
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
issue
come
up
in
other
circuits?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
have
other
circuits
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
express
examples
of
courts
paring
down,
sorting
the
case
out
as
between
what
is
won
and
what
has
been
lost.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
there
has
been
part
won
and
part
lost
and
the
district
court
doesn't
go
through
that
process
in
the
circuits
that
agree
with
you
they
set
it
aside
and
tell
him
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
the
trial
judge
has
no
discretion
to
pay...
to
award
fees
on
a
single
issue
claim
that
could
have
been
a
separate
lawsuit
on
which
there
is
a
loss.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
i
have
no
discretion.
justice
byron
r.
white
his
discretion
is
just
to
award
a
reasonable
fee
on
issues
that...
on
which
the
plaintiff
prevails.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
i
understand,
but
your
position
is,
there
is
no
discretion
to
award
fees
for...
on
issues
that
the
plaintiff
does
not
prevail
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
impossible
in
the
examples
you
gave
us,
these
single-issue
claims,
these
claims
that
could
have
been
single-issue
lawsuits.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
position
is
that
the
judge
had
absolutely
no
discretion
to
award
any
fees
with
respect
to
that
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
that's
where
the
confusion
is
on
counts
2
and
3.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
court,
the
district
court
in
this
case
went
through
this
catechism
that
you
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--where
do
you
find
that
in
its
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
sure
they
did,
and
then
i
take
it
that
they
said
as
long
as
the
party
receives
some
of
the
relief
requested,
the
status
as
a
prevailing
party
will
not
be
jeopardized,
and
then
they
just...
and
rejects
the
suggestion
that
he
should
put
aside
any
of
these
claims.
was
there
any
finding
that
they
were
interrelated?
justice
byron
r.
white
implicitly?
where
is
it
even--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
may
well
be
true,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
court
didn't
go
on
and
say
that
these
are
interrelated
claims.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
certainly
a
different
test
than
you
suggest
to
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what...
i
thought
you
said
you
were
only
supposed
to
award
fees
for
time
spent
on
successful
claims
and
on
other
claims
that
are
interconnected
or
interrelated.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
quite
a
different
test
than
awarding
time
spent
that
is
reasonably
calculated
to
advance
a
client's
interests.
