mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
act
434
was
adopted
by
the
legislature
of
alabama,
the
state
had
a
very
simple
and
understandable
tax
scheme
for
the
severance
taxation
of
oil
and
gas
production.
the
tax
was
imposed
on
all
of
the
oil
and
gas
produced.
there
was
a
definition
of
who
were
the
producers
of
that
gas
or
oil.
it
included
both
the
royalty
owner
and
the
working-interest
owner,
each
of
whom
bore
the
ultimate
incidence
of
the
tax
in
accordance
with
his
or
its
ratable
ownership
of
oil
or
gas
produced.
when
act
434
was
passed,
however,
we
find
a
drastic
change
in
the
alabama
scheme.
because
the
legislature
comes
along
and
for
the
first
time
with
respect
to
the
two
percent
increase
that
was
provided
by
that
statute
exempts
the
royalty
owner...
the
royalty
owner's
share
of
production...
from
any
portion
of
the
tax
increase.
the
language
of
the
statute
was
"any
person
who
is
a
royalty
owner
shall
be
exempt
from
the
payment
of
any
increase
in
taxes
herein
levied
and
shall
not
be
liable
therefore.
"
to
make
doubly
clear
the
intent
of
the
legislature,
they
then
proceeded
with
what
is
called
in
the
briefing
in
this
case
the
pass-through
prohibition
in
which
they
say,
"the
privilege
tax
herein
levied
shall
be
absorbed
and
paid
by
those
persons
engaged
in
the
business
of
producing
or
severing
oil
or
gas
only.
"
"and
the
producer
shall
not
pass
on
the
cost
of
such
tax
payments
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
consumer.
"
"it
being
the
express
intent
of
this
act
that
the
tax
herein
levied
shall
be
borne
exclusively
by
the
producer
or
severer
of
oil
or
gas.
"
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
that--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--as
construed
by
the
state,
that
is
what
it
means.
but
that
construction,
if
your
honor
please,
comes
in
a
background
of
a
statutory
scheme
where
the
statutory
definition
of
producers
unchanged
by
act
434
covers
both
the
royalty
owner
and
the
working-interest
owner.
and
so
any--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--well,
it
depends,
if
the
court
please,
on
whether
they
have
by
implication
repealed
the
definition
of
producer
which
we
do
not
think
that
they
have
because,
among
other
things,
the
statute
continues
to
say
that
the
tax
shall
be
imposed
on
all
of
the
production
including
the
share
of
the
royalty
owner.
now
this
comes
in
a
posture
where
the
evidence
showed
my
clients,
for
example,
had
leases
where
the
land
owner
would
expressly
agree
to
pay
his
proportionate
share
of
severance
taxes.
we
had
gas
sales
contracts
where
the
purchaser
would
expressly
agree
to
pay
any
increase
in
severance
taxes.
and,
because
of
the
existence
of
those
contracts,
our
first
contention
is
that
there
has
been
an
unconstitutional
impairment
of
contracts.
our
second
contention
is
that
there
has
been
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
now,--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--yes,
i
do,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
recall
your
question
to
mr.
crowe
on
that
subject.
as
we
endeavor
to
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
the
commissioner
is
engaged
in
an
absolutely
impermissible
attempt
to
rewrite
the
clear
language
of
the
statute.
when
you
say,
as
the
language
that
i
just
said,
does
say
that
the
tax
has
got
to
be
absorbed
by
the
producer,
and
that
he
cannot
pass
it
on
to
anybody
else,
how
can
the
commissioner
say
to
the
contrary?
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
i
do
not
understand
the
language
of
the--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--i
do
not
understand
what
the
supreme
court
has
said.
i
see
what
the
commissioner
has
said,
and
i
can
read
very
clearly
what
counsel
for
the
commissioner
said
at
an
earlier
date.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
40
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
find
a
quotation
from
exhibit
19...
plaintiff's
exhibit
19...
in
which
counsel
for
the
commissioner
construed
the
act
and
expressly
said
that
it
prohibited
and
pass-through
to
anybody.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
well,
that
is
certainly
an
additional--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--that
is
certainly
an
additional
question
if
your
honor
please.
and,
it
is
one,
of
course,
that
we
addressed
in
our
brief
that
the
government...
as
amigee
has
addressed.
we
do
say
that
it
has
been
preempted,
and
it
is
interesting
in
this
regard
and
in
connection
with
justice
o'connor's
question
that
in
the
state's
initial
brief
they
urged
this
complete
misreading
of
the
statute
claiming
that
we
could
pass-through
as
long
as
we
fraudulently
represented
that
we
were
doing
something
else.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
yes,
i
expect
to,
and
i--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--well,
it
seems
to
be
that
we
have
three
questions.
we
have
got
the
supremacy
question
as
the
preemption
question.
we
have
the
impairment
of
contracts.
we
have
got
the
equal
protection
question.
and
those
are
the
only
grounds
we
assert
on
behalf
of
my
clients.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
we
presented
all
of
those
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
yes.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
i
beg,
sir.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
no,
we
did
not.
we
presented
the
preemption
question
solely
on
the
ngpa.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
we
have
not,
sir.
my
clients
have
not.
the
reason...
a
reason
being,
first
that
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
statutory
prohibition
and
its
conflict
with
the
ngpa
is
not
a
severable
item.
the
legislature
of
alabama
never
intended
to
say
you
cannot
pass-through
as
to
gas
but
you
can
as
to
oil.
so
that
if
it
is
bad
under
the
ngpa,
it
is
bad.
and,
it
gets
stricken.
and,
we
think
that
is
the
easy,
clear
argument.
in
the
second
place,
two
of
my
clients
are
engaged
in
the
tully
litigation.
it
is
their
belief
that
the
epaa
issues
are
properly
addressed
in
the
federal
courts,
the
federal
court
system
at
topeka.
if
we
were
asked
to
express
an
opinion,
and
if
this
court
cares
to
pass
on
an
epaa
thing,
we
certainly
agree
with
the
position
taken
by
amigee
in
its
brief
on
that
question.
but,
we
did
not
argue
that
in
our
brief.
what
this
act
has
done,
is
not
only,
you
see,
to
tax
the
producer,
the
working
interest
owner,
on
his
own
share
of
production,
but
has
required
that
he
pick
up
the
tax
and
pay
it
on
the
royalty
owners'
interest
share
of
production.
completely
contrary
to
the
definition
of
who
shall
be
producers...
completely
contrary,
we
believe,
to
this
court's
opinion
in
barwise
v.
sheppard.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
see
that
when
the
state
addresses
the
impairment
question
here,
he
makes
no
effort
to
try
to
meet
the
kinds
of
tests
that
the
court
has
laid
down
in
blazedale
and
his
progeny
insofar
as
the
circumstances
under
which
contracts
may
be
impaired.
all
he
does
in
substance
is
to
say
that
the
legislature
probably
was
trying
to
avoid
being
perceived
as
levying
a
consumer
tax.
now,
that
may
be
a
good
political
reason
for
a
member
of
the
legislature,
but
it
certainly
in
our
judgment
does
not
express
the
kind
of
broad
public
general
societal
purpose
that
is
required
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
constitutional
impairment.
and
in
this
instance,
our
reasonable
contractual
expectations
were
certainly
destroyed.
even,
justice
o'connor,
if
the
state
were
correct
in
rewriting
the
statute
as
they
attempted
to
do,
how
do
they
take
the
part...
what
about
the
royalty
owner?
what
do
they
say
about
that?
do
they
say
that
the
royalty
owner
has
to
pay
its
tax?
do
they
rewrite
that
too?
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
our
clients
are
lessees
and
also
royalty
owners.
we
are
both
working
interest
and
royalty
owners...
and
are
royalty
owners.
so
we
submit
that
as
far
as
the
impairment
question
is
concerned,
there
is
complete
absence
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
really
address
the
tests
in
blazedale
and
his
progeny.
when
you
get
to
the
equal
protection
aspects
of
the
matter,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
definition...
look,
if
the
court
will,
at
the
impact
of
what
this
does.
if
you
have
got
a
royalty
owner...
if
you
have
got
a
lease--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
preemption...
on
preemption
the
ngpa...
and
that
is
the
only
argument
that
we
make
in
our
brief,
and
i
will
address
that
only
rather
than
the
epaa
question.
the
ngpa
clearly
says
that
to
the
maximum
lawful
price
may
be
added
severance
taxes
imposed
by
the
state.
flat
language
of
the
statute
says
that.
i
submit
to
your
honor,
there
is
no
way
to
read
this
statute...
this
pass-through
prohibition
in
this
statute...
without
saying
that
the
legislature
of
alabama
has
directly
sought
to
nullify
that
provision
ngpa.
there
is
a
clear
and
direct
conflict.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
well,
may
i
just
go
back
again,
if
i
may
to
that
page
40
on
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
we
still--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
to
get
to
the
preemption
question
which
i
think
is
the
first
one
that
your
honor
put
to
me...
i
think,
yes,
we
would
have
a
conflict
with
ngpa.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
the
tax,
right.
you
may...
and
they
do
not
say,
for
example...
they
set
a
maximum
lawful
price
based
on
the
factors
of
escalation
and
so
on.
they
do
not
say
we
can
up
that
any
two
percent
and
then
having
done
that
just
say
we
have
had
a
price
increase
so
we
have
met
the
alabama
statute
as
currently
interpreted
by
the
commissioner.
yes,
i
think
we
would
clearly
continue
to
have
the
preemption
problem
in
the
case.
as
to
whether
we
would
continue
to
have
any
impairment
or
equal
protection,
i
think
your
honor
started
asking
me
to
just
say
that
we
are
going
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
right.
i
would
be
here
on
the
other
two
questions--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--and,
we
would
indeed
still...
even
the
commissioner's
argument,
of
course,
does
not
get
to
the
royalty
owner
exemption.
even
if
he
can
rewrite
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
like
he
claims
to,
there
is
no
way
for
him
to
say
that
we
had
any
right
to
go
and
deduct
from
the
royalty
owner...
payments
to
the
royalty
owners
taxed
on
his
proportionate
share
of
the
production.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
we
have
not...
we
are
making
a
claim
for
the
two
percent
that
we
have
paid
to
the
state
under
what
we
consider
to
be
a
nonseverable
unconstitutional
statute.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
we
have
paid
the
money
to
the
state.
it
is
being
held
in
escrow
pending
the
resolution
of
the
case.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
i
did
not
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
yes,
i
would
say
that
we
do
because
we
have
not,
in
fact,
passed
through
the
taxes,
you
see.
we
have
just
paid
the
money
to
the
state.
and,
if
the
court
were
to
now
say,
for
example,
that
we
are
not
going
to
declare
the
entire
act
unconstitutional,
we
consider
it
severable,
but
we
are
going
to
nullify
on
preemption
grounds
and
on
equal
protection
and
on
impairment
of
contract,
or
whatever,
these
unconstitutional
provisions,
then
presumably
we
would
have
some
chance
of
going
after
the
people
with
whom
we
had
contracts.
but
only
those
with
whom
we
had
contracts.
as,
for
example,
if
we
sold
crude
oil
on
the
spot
market
during
the
time
that
this
act
was
in
effect,
we
got
no
contract
to
get
no
more
money
from
those
people.
we
were
prohibited
by
the
state
from
adding
the
severance
tax
to
the
price.
we
paid
the
tax
on
that
sale.
but,
we
cannot
go
back
and
say
to
somebody,
say
there
would
be
two
percent
more
to
you
in
those
days
if
we
had
been
able
to
pass
it
through.
so,
yes
we--
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
--right.
mr.
c.
b.
arendall,
jr.
and
the
two
percent,
not
the
four
percent,
the
two
percent
is
paid
under
protest
and
is
in
escrow--
