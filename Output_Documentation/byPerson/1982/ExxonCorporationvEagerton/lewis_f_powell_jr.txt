justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
are
you
making
claim
for
the
taxes
that
you
did
not
pass-through
before
this
latest
interpretation
by
the
alabama
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
money
you
have
already
paid
out?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
if
the
court
interpretation
is
correct,
you
still
have
claim
for
back
taxes
that
you
should
not
have
had
to
pay?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
you
accept
the
new
interpretation
by
the
commissioner
that
the
tax
can
be
passed
through
if
you
hide
it
enough,
do
you
still
have
a
claim
assuming
you
accept
his
interpretation...
for
back
taxes...
the
taxes
you
could
not
pass
through.
perhaps
i
do
not
understand
it.
