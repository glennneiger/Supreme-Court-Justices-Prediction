as
taxes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
so,
i
am
curious
how
you
establish
your
injury
if
the
commissioner's
present
position
is
correct.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
have
the
proof
in
front
of
us
that
would
clearly
establish
that
your
clients
could
not
have
increased
the
price
to
take
care
of
this--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
they
allow
escalation
of
prices.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
other
words,
we
don't
really
know
whether
your
clients
suffered
any
injury.
would
we
have
to
remand
to
determine
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
we
don't
know,
if
i
may
pursue
it
further,
whether
they
could
have
passed
it
on
in
some
other
form?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
have
a
position
on
the
question
of
the
position
now
taken
by
the
commissioner
that
the
tax
in
effect
could
be
passed
on
if
you
call
it
something
else
and
just
raise
the
price?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
that
alabama
supreme
court
opinion
was
equivocal
on
that
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
language,
at
least,
does
not
make
it
crystal
clear,
and
i
wonder
whether
that
is
not
a
question
for
the
state
law
courts
rather
than
a
question
for
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
the
language
of
this
alabama
statute
says
that
the
producer
cannot
pass
on
the
tax
either
directly
or
indirectly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
are
arguing
he
can
do
it
indirectly,
are
you
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
really
decided
that
question?
