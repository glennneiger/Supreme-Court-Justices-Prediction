mr.
rae
m.
crowe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
piece
of
legislation,
passed
in
alabama
in
1979,
involves
several
constitutional
questions
which
have
been
raised
by
producers
or
servers
of
natural
gas
and
crude
oil
within
the
state.
it
was
introduced
in
1979
by
representative
hines
of
escambia
county,
one
of
the
state's
largest
producing
counties
insofar
as
oil
and
gas
production
is
concerned.
it
initially
was
introduced
to
increase
the
tax
two
percent
state-wide.
representative
hines,
according
to
the
record,
had
failed
to
pass
this
legislation
in
three
previous
occasions.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
he
can
pass
legislature
under
local
courtesy
if
it
affects
only
his
county,
he
being
the
only
representative
from
the
county,
from
that
district,
in
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
yes.
when
he
encountered
the
difficulty
with
the
speaker
of
the
house,
by
his
own
testimony,
in
the
governor's
office,
in
the
house
ways
and
means
committee,
he
submitted
a
very
important
amendment,
we
submit,
as
a
matter
of
legislative
history.
this
tax
was
four
percent.
it
was
increased
to
two
percent.
at
the
foot
of
the
taxing
paragraph,
he
entered
a
so-called
depth
proviso
which
provided,
in
effect,
that
provided,
however,
that
the
increase
shall
be
limited
to
well
producing
in
a
smackover
formation
at
the
depth
of
15/15.8.
his
county
was,
according
to
the
record,
the
only
county
in
the
state,
then
and
now,
producing
hydrocarbons
in
this
geological
interval
at
this
depth.
he
represented
to
the
committees
and
on
the
floor
that
his
amendment
had
made
the
bill
local,
applied
to
his
own
county.
he
was
quoted
in
the
newspapers
as
having
said
this.
and,
the
bill
passed
with
no
nays
essentially.
accordingly,
the
bill
received
local
courtesy.
the
chairman
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
so
testified.
the
legislative
journal
entries
show
that
the
bill
was
carried
on
the
journal
as
an
uncontested
local
bill
along
with--
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
--it
makes
a
difference
in
this
respect:
our
clients
are
non-escambia
county
producers
which
were
not
expected
to
have
been
taxed
under
the
legislation.
once
the
bill
had
been
passed,
the
commissioner
of
revenue,
the
appellee
here,
construed
it
legally
to
be
a
state-wide
measure.
refund
suits
were
filed
by
the
producers,
the
non-escambia
county
producers;
uncontested
legislative
history
in
the
form
of
journal
entries,
physical
notes,
limiting
the
revenues
only
to
escambia
county.
there
was
no
contrary
legislative
history.
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
reads
that
the
act,
under
the
legislative
history,
was
clearly
and
without
any
question
a
local
act
applying
only
to
one
county
out
of
67.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
i
realize
that
this
court
does
not,
justice
rehnquist,
involved
generally
in
statutory
construction
of
state
statutes.
but,
when
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
ruled
that
they
would
not
look
at
the
legislative
history,
we
contend
we
were
not
given
a
fair
hearing
as
a
matter
of
due
process
when
they
totally
ignored
the
uncontroverted
legislative
history,
including
statements
from
the
sole
sponsor
of
the
local
bill.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
i
think
we
cite
in
our
brief
two
cases
that
indicate...
one
is
a
missouri
case,
the
brinkerhoff
case,
where
this
court
held
that
actions
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
deprived
the
litigants
there
of
due
process.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
they
said
they
could
not
stray
into
the
mazes
of
conjecture.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
under
circumstances,
however,
where
there
is
uncontroverted
testimony
from
the
sponsor
himself,
the
sole
and
only
sponsor,
that
it
was
his
intention
to
tax
his
own
county
to
address
a
revenue
shortfall
in
his
own
county.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
well,
first,
during
the
currency
of
this
act,
they
were
prohibited
from
passing
through
the
severance
taxes.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
as
a
tax.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
all
right.
justice
o'connor,
the
contracts
fix
a
price.
they
fix
a
definite
price.
the
national
gas
policy
act
for
various
categories
of
natural
gas
fix
a
price.
and,
either
by
virtue
of
the
maximum
statutory
ceiling
price
and/or
by
virtue
of
the
contract
provisions
themselves,
we
could
only
charge
the
price
either
permitted
by
law
or
agreed
to
by
contract,
but
were
permitted
to
pass
on
taxes
under
the
express
wording
of
the
contract.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
the
contracts
are
in
the
record.
and,
of
course,
the
law
is
that--
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
--the
contracts?
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
i
am
not
certain
whether...
the
price
escalation
was
not
involved
here.
i
am
not
sure
whether
they...
some
of
them
may
have
and
some
of
them
may
have
not
depending
upon--
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
--i
think
you
do
know,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
clients
who
could
not
pass
through
the
severance
statutes
as
agreed
upon
and
had
to
swallow
that
tax
suffered
the
loss
of
the
amount
of
tax
that
they
could
not
pass
through.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
i
think
they
could
not
have
because
the
ngpa
mandates
the
maximum
price
in
both
intra
and
interstate
commerce
and
the
contracts,
some
of
which
predated
the
ngpa,
specified
what
that
price
would
be.
turning
for
a
moment
to
the
equal
protection
arguments
that
we
have
advanced
to
the
court
with
respect
to
the
royalty
owners
exemption,
the
act
in
question
exempted
the
royalty
owners
from
the
two
percent
increase,
but
apparently
left
the
royalty
owners
subject
to
the
four
percent
portion
of
the
tax.
the
record
shows
that
we
had
both
leases
as
well
as
the
contracts,
to
which
justice
o'connor
referred,
which
specifically
provided
in
the
case
of
the
leases
that
the
lessee
and
the
lessor
will
share
and
bear
the
severance
tax
pro
rata.
so,
we
are
contending
that
we
have...
that
the
royalty
owner
exemption
should
be
held
unconstitutional.
the
class,
we
submit
to
the
court,
is
one
of
ownership.
there
is
a
mineral
fee,
if
the
court
will,
a
producing
mineral
estate.
the
royalty
owner
owns
a
share
in
it
as
a
joint
tenant.
the
lessee
owns
a
share
in
it
as
a
joint
tenant.
this
court
has
held
in
barwise
v.
sheppard
that
an
oil
and
gas
lease
constitutes
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
common
or
joint
adventure
with
the
profits
to
be
shared
pro
rata
in
accordance
with
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
lease.
thus,
we
submit
that
a
lessor
is
a
royalty
owner
and
the...
is
a
land
owner,
and
the
lessee
is
likewise
a
land
owner
under
the
jurisprudence
of
alabama
and
most
oil
producing
states.
there
are
three
reasons
for
this.
the
alabama
code
specifically
provides
that
the
tax
will
be
levied
in
proportion
to
ownership.
the
alabama
code
specifically
provides
that
producers
shall
include
a
royalty
owner.
the
alabama
code
specifically
says
that
the
tax
is
levied
on
the
full
stream
of
the
well
including
that
known
as
the
royalty
interest.
furthermore,
the
code
provides...
and
this
is
not
in
any
of
the
briefs
and
perhaps
it
should
have
been...
the
code
provides
that
the
severance
taxes
in
lieu
of
ad
valorem
taxes
and
ad
valorem
taxes,
of
course,
being
a
tax
on
real
estate
and
we
say
that
the
only
reasonable,
logical,
fair
classification
is
that
of
ownership
of
the
production
from
the
mineral
fee
and
that
there
is
no
reasonable
classification
that
can
be...
where
it
says
four
percent
of
the
tax
will
be
borne
equally,
but
two
percent
will
be
borne
unequally
and
disproportionate
to
the
ownership.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
another
reason
that
makes
the
tax
regressive.
royalty
percentage
is
very
widening.
this
record
shows
some
royalties
up
to
over
50
%.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
well,
i
think
it
is
a
question
of
classification
and
equal
protection
within
the
price.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
well,
it
does
not
apply
equally
even
between
lessees.
mr.
rae
m.
crowe
well,
what
i
am
saying,
i
think,
is,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
tax
does
not
apply
equally
between
either
royalty
owners
or
working
interest
owners
or
land
owners.
and,
if
that...
the
land
owner
should
be
the
criteria
for
making
a
distinction
between
one
molecule
of
gas
and
another
molecule
of
gas;
that
the
royalties'
gas
should
be
the
same
share
of
production
as
the
working
interest.
in
fact,
the
largest
royalty
owner
in
mobile
county
is
one
of
the
major
oil
companies.
one
of
the
major
paper
companies
is
probably
the...
owning
a
lot
of
land...
is
probably
second.
so
there
is
no
societal
distinction
between
the
royalty-interest
side
and
the
working-interest
side.
it
simply
is
that
some
people
prefer
to
invest
on
the
royalty
side
and
others
invest
on
the
working-interest
side.
in
the
barwise
case
which
i
previously
referred
to,
it
was
a
texas
tax
involved
which
was
equally
imposed
on
the
full
production
of
the
well
both
on
the
lessor
and
the
lessee.
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
reasonable
classification
as
to
both
the
lessor
as
it
was
to
the
lessee.
our
authority
for
the
proposition
we
are
submitting
to
the
court
is
a
1937
decision
of
this
court
in
barwise
v.
sheppard.
