justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
he
able
to
pass
legislation
all
by
himself
or
does
the
legislature
pass
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
is
it
actually...
is
the
bill
actually
enacted,
at
least
in
form,
by
the
whole
legislature?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
federal
claim
do
you
make
out
of
all
these
facts?
i
mean,
doesn't
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
have
the
final
say
as
to
whether
or
not--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
alabama
supreme
court,
i
take
it,
heard
your
argument
on
legislative
history.
they
just
didn't
highlight
the
legislative
history.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
are
lots
of
opinions
from
this
court
that
say
the
same
thing,
aren't
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
speak
only
for
myself,
but
i
hope
you
have
a
better
federal
claim
than
that
one.
mr.
crowe,
on
a
slightly
different
subject,
as
i
understand
it,
the
commissioner
now
takes
the
position
that
the
act
in
question
does
not
prohibit
producers,
working
producers,
from
passing
through
the
increase
in
severance
taxes
just
so
long
as
they
don't
do
it
as
taxes.
now,
if
that
position
is
correct,
how
have
your
clients
suffered
any
injury?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
constitutionally
in
front
of
us
about
a
regressive
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
i
agree
with
you,
but
you
said
you
are
arguing
now
that
the
tax
is
regressive
and
a
regressive
tax
isn't
an
unconstitutional
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no
taxes
apply
equally.
some
people
are
taxed
and
some
are
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
your
clients
royalty
owners?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
the
citation
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
it
is
11a.
i
am
sorry.
i
have
the
jurisdictional
statement.
you
are--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
does
say
that
you
can
raise
your
price
by
the
amount
of
a
severance
tax
if
you
have
separately
billed
or
charged
the
severance
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
give
you
two
examples.
suppose
there
is
a
charge
made
of
a
quoted
price
of
a
dollar
and
to
that
is
added
a
two
percent
severance
tax,
so
your
bill
is
$1.02
per
item.
now,
is
that
permissible
under
alabama
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
perhaps
you
could
just
answer
that
and
then--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but,
supposing
you
have...
you
bill
the
person
$1.02
and
say
two
cents
of
this
is
for--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but,
do
you
think
you
could
recover...
do
you
think
you
could
raise
your
price
under
the
ngpa
if
you
did
it
that
way?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
breckenridge,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
interpreted
as
narrowly
as
conceivable
the
anti
pass-on
provision
where
the
legislature
said
you
can't
pass
it
on
directly
or
indirectly?
i
suppose
maybe
you
might
have
read
that
requirement
the
same,
that
the
only
way
to
absorb
it
is
after
you
declare
a
dividend
to
the
stockholders
you
have
to
take
the
tax
out
of
that
dividend.
but,
the
alabama
supreme
court
came
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
and
said
that
really
all
we
are
talking
about
is
you
can't
add
it
to
a
quoted
price.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
use
both
of
those
arguments
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
discussion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
where
they
cite
the
state
case
of
hayden
against
watson
at
page
9
of
the
appendix?
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
seems
to
simply
talk
in
terms
of
the
power
of
the
legislature
to
establish
classification.
was
that
a
response
to
a
federal
equal
protection
argument
by
the--
