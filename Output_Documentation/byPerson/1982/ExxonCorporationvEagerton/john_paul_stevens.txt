justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
what
you
actually
put
into
escrow
in
the
state?
you
paid
the
two
percent
increase.
first
of
all,
you
had
a
four
percent
tax
before.
i
want...
say
you
had
an
example
where
you
had
a
75
percent
working
interest
and
a
25
percent
royalty.
under
the
four
percent
you
paid
75...
four
percent
of
75
percent
of
the
production,
and
under
the
two
percent
you
pay
100
percent.
so,
and
you
paid
100
percent
regardless
of
the
size
of
the
working
interest.
is
that
correct?
and
all
that
money
is
in
escrow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
whole
two
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
mr.
breckenridge,
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
only
way
the
producer
can
get
the
increase
under
the
federal
statute
is
to
identify
it
as
the
recovery
of
the
severance
tax?
and
isn't
that
the
one
thing
the
state
law
prohibits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
go
over
the
ceiling
by
a
certain
percent,
doesn't
he
have
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
for
federal
purposes
that
the
extra
amount
being
charged
is
to
recover
the
state
severance
tax?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
is
that
permitted
under
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
what
does
the
state
law
prohibit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
put
on
to
recover
the
severance
tax.
that
is
prohibited
by
state
law.
but
that
is
what
he
must
do
under
federal
law
to
get
the
increase.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
state
interest
in
requiring
the
billing
procedure
to
follow
a
precise
form,
one
form
rather
than
another?
i
can
understand
a
state
law
that
says
you
can't
pass
it
on,
but
what
is
the
purpose
for
a
state
law
that
says
you
can
pass
it
on
provided
you
do
it
in
the
following
form.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
really
care
whether
there
is
a
reason
for
it
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
it
palpably
arbitrated,
say
you
must
follow
this
form
rather
than
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
you
cannot
identify
a
rational
basis
for
doing
it
for
that
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
tell
me
what
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
saying
must
bill
in
this
particular
way?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
their
due
process
argument.
their
equal
protection
argument
is
the
fact
that
there
is
an
exemption
for
royalty
for
the
non-working
interest
owners.
that
is
their
equal
protection
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
right
about
the
label,
but
let's
talk
about
the
royalty
owner
problem
for
a
minute.
how
do
you
answer
that
one?
let
me
ask
you,
in
the
legislation
ten
months
later,
did
you
change
the
statute
in
this
respect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that
is
still
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
justify...
say
you
have
one...
two
producers,
one
has
a
50
%
working
interest
and
the
other
has
a
75
%
working
interest.
they
both,
say,
pay
the
same
tax,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
same
rate
and
the
same
dollar
amount
if
they
produce
the
same
amount.
and,
the
exemption...
does
not
the
exemption
mean
that
the
smaller
working
interest
pays
a
higher
rate
on
his
actual
earnings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
have
got
100
%
of
production.
you
pay
two
percent
on
100
%
production
even
though
his
economic
interest
is
only
50
%,
isn't
that
right?
isn't
that
their
argument?
maybe
i
don't
understand
their
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
understand
they
are
making
an
equal
protection
argument
based
on
the
exemption
for
the
royalty
interest,
because
the
economic
effect
of
the
exemption
is
to
produce
distortions
in
the
rates
paid
by
those
who
actually
produce
the
gas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
again,
what
is
the
rational
basis
for
charging
one
producer
a
higher
rate
simply
because
he
has
a
different
percentage
interest
in
the
lease?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
if
you
construe
the
statute
your
way,
it
does
have
the
affect
of
charging
different
producers
different
rates
for
the
same
amount
of
gas
being
produced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
producer...
if
the
producer
has
a
smaller
percentage
interest
in
the
lease
and
they
all
pay
two
percent
on
total
production,
the
producer
with
the
smaller
percentage
is
paying
a
higher
percentage
on
what
he
actually
earns.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
irony
here
is
that
the
smaller
your
working
interest
the
higher
your
tax.
go
ahead.
