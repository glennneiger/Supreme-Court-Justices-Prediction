justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
exxon
corporation
against
eagerton
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
crowe,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me,
counsel,
i
am
a
little
uncertain
why...
if
the
enactment
passed
the
legislature,
what
difference
does
it
make
how
it
got
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
arendall,
you
mentioned
two
questions
that
you
saw
in
this
case.
i
must...
i
have
this
case
confused
with
some
other
case
on
the
calendar.
i
had
been
under
the
impression
that
at
least
one
question
was
whether
this
area...
this
alabama
statute...
had
been
preempted
by
federal
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
not
heard
the
word
preemption
from
anyone
yet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
going
to
discuss
the
preemption
issue
in
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
missed
that.
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
breckenridge,
i
am
sure
it
must
be
apparent
to
you
now
that
we
are
somewhat
interested
in
the
preemption
question,
and
we
want
you
to
be
sure
to
address
that
in
your
own
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
breckenridge.
thank
you,
gentlemen,
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
pennhurst
state
school
against
halderman.
