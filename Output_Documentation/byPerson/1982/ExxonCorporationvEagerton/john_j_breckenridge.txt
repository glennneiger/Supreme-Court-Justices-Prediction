mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
was
going
to
address
the
arguments
that
they
raised
as
they
raised
them,
but
i
sitting
here,
determined
that
this
court
is
highly
interested
in
the
preemption
clause,
and
i
better
get
to
that
first
and
not
delay
any
longer.
it
is
the
position
of
the
commissioner
of
revenue
that
there
is
no
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
and
thus,
there
is
no
preemption
issue.
the
ngpa,
the
natural
gas
policy
act,
the
only
federal
statute
that
we
are
talking
about
here
today...
and
let
me
say
why
i
say
that...
the
trial
court
did
not
say
anything
about
the
epaa
and
neither
did
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
this
court
has
been
asked
to
look
at
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
see
if
it
is
correct
or
not.
there
is
nothing
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama's
decision
whatsoever
about
the
epaa.
so,
i
would
like
to
address
my
preemption
clause...
preemption
question
solely
to
the
natural
gas
policy
act.
what
the
natural
gas
policy
act
says...
the
particular
section
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act
that
is
in
dispute...
what
it
says
is
that
the
first
seller
of
the
natural
gas
is
allowed
to
raise
the
maximum
lawful
price
to
reflect
recovery...
and
it
uses
the
word
recovery...
of
certain
items...
and
they
are
listed
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e.
and
item
a
is
state
severance
taxes.
item
b
is
cost
of
transportation,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
these
are
all
deemed
costs
under
the
ngpa
that
allows
a
first
seller,
or
producer...
a
working
interest...
a
producer,
first
seller
to
recover
his
costs.
now--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
alabama
supreme
court,
when
faced
with
this
statute...
first
of
all,
they
had
certain
rules
of
statutory
construction
to
give
the
appellants
equal
protection
and
due
process
that
they
have
to
follow.
and,
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
is--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
believe
so,
yes
ma'am.
and
i...
let's
go
to
the
language
they
used.
"the
two
acts
were
aimed",...
this
is
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
speaking,...
"the
two
acts
were
aimed
at
entirely
different--
"
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--yes,
justice
rehnquist.
it
is
page
12
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
page
12.
ngpa,...
"are
aimed
at
entirely
different
purposes.
"
"in
other
words,
although.
"
--and
this
is
the
point
i
want
to
emphasize,...
"although
it
would
be
perfectly
permissible
for
the
oil
and
gas
companies
to
raise
the
price
for
the
first
sale
of
natural
gas,
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act--
"
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--let
me
emphasize
the
language
i
am
speaking
about.
"in
other
words,
although
it
would
be
perfectly
permissible
for
the
oil
and
gas
companies
to
raise
the
price
for
the
first
sale
of
natural
gas,
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
natural
gas
policy
act,
all
that
act
79-434
requires
is
that
the
increase
in
severance
tax
mandated
by
that
act
be
borne
by
the
producer
or
severer
of
the
oil
or
gas.
"
"thus
the
pass-through
prohibition
contained
in
act
no.
79-434
does
not
conflict
with
the
natural
gas
policy
act
of
1978,
and
the
trial
court's
findings
to
that
effect
is
due
to
be
reversed.
"
now,
what
they
said
is
that
under
the
alabama
law
and
a
reading
of
the
ngpa
it
is
perfectly
permissible
for
the
first
seller
of
the
natural
gas
to
include
in
the
maximum
lawful
price
the
increase
in
the
tax,
just
so
long
as
he
does
not
tack
it
on
as
a
tax.
now,
i
take
strong
exception
to
something
that
mr.
crowe
said...
i
mean
mr.
arendall
said...
he
said
that
the
natural
gas
policy
act
requires
clearly
in
its
language
that
the
tax
be
added
to
the
maximum'
lawful
price
as
a
tax.
let's
look
at
what
the
act
really
says.
i
do
not
have
the
joint
appendix
cite
for
this.
it
is
15
u.s.c.
section
3320(a)
1.
"a
price
for
the
first
sale
of
natural
gas
shall
not
be
considered
to
exceed
the
maximum
lawful
price
applicable
to
the
first
sale
of
such
of
such
natural
gas
under
this
part
if
such
for-sale
price
exceeds
the
maximum
lawful
price
to
the
extent
necessary
to
recover.
"
and
then
it
says
subdivision
one,
"state
severance
taxes
attributable
to
production
of
such
natural
gas
and
borne
by
the
seller.
"
if
you
look
on,
it
also
allows
the
recovery
of
the
cost
of
transportation,
the
additional
increased
cost
of
production--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
do
not
think
so,
justice
stevens.
i
think,
sure
he
can
give
an
itemized
billing,
but
he
cannot
add
a
surcharge
or
surtax
as--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
would
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
yes
sir,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
the
state
law
simply
prohibits
billing
the
consumer,
when
he
gets
the
gasoline
or
the
fuel
oil
or
whatever
it
is
used
for,
saying
the
price
of
this
gasoline
is
$1.09
a
gallon
plus
3
cents
increase
severance
charge.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
but,
the
federal
law
does
not
prohibit...
the
federal
law
does
not
require
that
the
tax
be
added
to
the
maximum
lawful
price.
it
says
it
shall
be
included
in
the
maximum
lawful
price.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
that
is
correct.
and
i
think
justice
stevens
says
when
you
send
somebody
that
bill
where
you
have
increased
your
maximum
lawful
price,
you
think
it
is
okay
for
them
to
tell
the
buyer
why
the
price
is
increased...
that
it
is
due
in
this
instance
to
an
increase
in
the
state
severance
tax.
and
i
say,
yes,
i
think
it
is
permissible
to
tell
the
buyer
that
the
increased
maximum
lawful
price
has
been
increased
because
of
a
two
percent
severance
tax
in
alabama.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
if
you
say
the
price
is
a
dollar
plus
two
percent
tax...
as
we
go
into
a...
can
i
draw
an
analogy
real
quick?
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
would
say
that
you
could
not
do
it
that
way.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
you
could
do
it
that
way.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
yes,
i
think
you
could.
and,
to
answer
one
of
justice
o'connor's
questions,
what
injury
have
they
suffered
if
they
are
allowed
to
pass
along
the
tax?
how
have
they
been
harmed?
they
are
allowed
to
pass
along
the
tax
and
i
don't
see
what
they
say...
how
they
have
been
injured.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
in
alabama,
we
have
certain
rules,
statutory
construction,
that
the
commissioner
of
revenue
has
to
follow
and
even
the
supreme
court
follows
these
rules
in
alabama
and
that
is
that
you
don't
try
to
find
out
the
motives
of
why
the
legislature--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--as
long
it
is
not
palpably
arbitrated
erroneously.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
think
they...
i
think
the
legislature
has
full
discretion.
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
said
over
and
over
again
that
legislatures
have
wide
discretion
in
where
they
want
to
levy
the
tax
and
who
they
want
the
tax
to
fall
on.
i
think--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
think
a
rational
basis
could
be
identified.
i
assume
that
the--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
assume
that
the
legislature--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
assume
that
the
legislature
of
alabama
decided
that
they
did
not
want
to
be
perceived
as
levying
another
consumer
tax,
but
wanted
the
tax
to
be
upon
the
producers
and
that
is
what--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--let's
look
at
what
the
alabama
supreme
court,
some
of
the
rules
they
were
fared
with
when
they
saw
this
conflict.
the
rules
of
alabama
and
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
are
that
when
two
statute...
when
a
statute
is
before
the
court
and
there
are
two
interpretations,
one
of
which
will
require
a
holding
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
and
another
interpretation
that
will
save
the
statute,
that
the
courts
are
duty
bound
to
adopt
the
interpretation
that
will
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
legislature
is
presumed
to
have
acted
reasonably
and
not
to
have
passed
unconstitutional
law.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
in
answering
justice
o'connor's
questions
about
did
they
specifically
say
that
the
producers
could
do
this,
they
said,
look
at
both
of
the
laws,
we
think
it
is
perfectly
permissible
to
raise
the
maximum
law
for
price
just
so
long
as
you
don't
pass
it
along
as
a
consumer
tax.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
that
is
the
language
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
used
and
we
assume...
the
commissioner
has
to
assume
that
they
meant
what
they
said.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
no,
justice
marshall.
i
would
say
what
they
say
is
maximum
lawful
price
can
be
raised,
but
that
the--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--it
can
be
raised...
the
statute
says,
and
i
believe
alabama
supreme
court
says
implicitly
that
it
can
be
raised
an
amount
to
recover
the
cost
of
their
paying
the
tax.
now,
one
of
the
things
about
the
bill
is
that
the
tax
has
to
be
borne
by
the
seller.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
that
was
the
amount
that
was
necessary...
this
is
the
amount
i
am
allowed
to
recover
from
you
for
my
paying
the
state
of
alabama
severance
tax.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
it
is
not
a
tax
on
you,
no,
sir.
it
is
a
tax
on
me
and
i
am
allowed
to
pass
it
on--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--no,
sir.
i
am
allowed
to
recover
my
costs.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
sir?
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
rehnquist.
the
appellants
have
also
raised
certain
issues
about
the
contract
clause
and
they
have
cited
the
barwise
case
as
we
have
cited
the
barwise
case.
i
think
the
barwise
case,
the
united
states
supreme
court
case,
barwise
v.
sheppard,
is
more
in
favor
of
the
state
of
alabama
or
the
commissioner
of
revenue's
interpretation
than
the
appellant
oil
company.
it
is
almost
black-letter
law
in
america
that
parties
to
a
private
contract
cannot
limit
a
state's
ability
to
levy
taxes
or
to
select
upon
whom
those
taxes
are
to
fall.
clearly
two
individuals
or
two
corporations
can't
get
together
and
say,
as
between
us,
we
are
going
to
bind
the
state
of
alabama
or
any
other
state
and
say
that
they
can't
levy
additional,
increased
taxes
on
us.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
and
i
am
sure
that
the
court
realizes,
that
every
tax
of
any
kind
to
some
extent
affects
a
contract
right.
any
tax
that
i
can
think
of
to
some
extent
affects
somebody's
contract.
it
is
just
inconceivable
that
the
state's
sovereign
right
to
tax
can
be
taken
away
by
a
contract
between
private
corporations.
there
is
an
implicit...
the
commissioner
submits
that
there
is
an
implicit
limitation
on
the
right
to
contract
that
must
recognize
the
sovereign
right
of
a
state
to
exercise
its
power
of
taxation.
as
justice
holmes
has
said
in
the
barwise
case
or
was
quoting
the
barwise
case,
"when
these
rights
are
subject
to
state
restrictions
cannot
remove
them
from
the
power
of
the
state
by
making
a
contract
about
them.
"
i
would
like
to
go
back
for
a
moment
about
the
natural
gas
policy
act
and
raise
an
issue
that
we
raised
in
our
briefs
and
that
is
that
the
alabama
statute
contains
a
severability
clause.
the
alabama
statute
we
are
talking
about
is
over
four
pages
long
and
the
main
sentence
we
are
talking
about
is
simply
that,
one
sentence.
it
is
the
position
of
the
commissioner
of
revenue
that
should
this
court
decide
that
the
pass-through
prohibition
is
pre-empted
under
the
supremacy
clause
by
the
ngpa;
that
because
of...
that
contains
a
severability
clause
which
says
that
should
any
portion
of
this
act
be
deemed
unconstitutional
the
remainder
of
the
act
shall
stand,
shall
survive;
that
the
court,
as
the
very
least,
would
have
to
send
it
back
down
to
the
state
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
determine
whether
or
not...
what
effect
the
severability
clause
has.
now,
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
less
than
ten
months
later
the
legislature
of
alabama
adopted
the
identical
language
of
that
79-434
and
they
left
out
one
sentence,
the
pass-through
prohibition,
and
they
added
on
sentence
that
allowed
unitization
method
of
reporting.
we
think
this
is
highly
persuasive
that
the
pass-through
prohibition
was
not
an
essential
part
of
the
79
act
so
as
to
cause
the
whole
act
to
fall.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
am
not
clear,
justice
white,
on
what
other
grounds
you
are
referring.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
if
the
court
rules,
for
instance,
that
the
pass-through
prohibition--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--let's
look
at
the
contract
clause.
what
the
oil
companies
are
saying
is
that
because
of
the
anti
pass-through
prohibition
their,
contracts
were
invalidated
because
they
can't
pass
along
the
tax.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
don't
understand
how
you
could
pass
on
the
contract
clause.
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
say
here.
if
the
anti
pass-through
provision,
if
you
strike
it
down,
if
this
court
strikes
it
down,
it
is
out.
where
is
the
contract
clause
question
then?
the
contract
clause
also
hinges
on
the
anti
pass-through
prohibit.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
can
address
that
now.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
the
court
could--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
don't
think
so.
i
could
suggest--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--no,
sir.
i
will
say
why.
i
think
what
the
court
would
do
is
if
it
decided
to
strike
down
the
pass-through
prohibition
and
send
it
back
down
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
usually
this
prudent
court
waits
until
the
state
supreme
court
has
ruled
on
that
question
before
it
will...
the
state
supreme
court
may
strike
the
whole
statute
down,
it
may
not.
but,
we
would
never
get
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
equal
protection
argument
is...
if
i
may
go
over
what
the
equal
protection
argument
is,
they
are
saying,
because
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
refused
to
accept
their
version
of
the
legislative
history,
things
they
call
legislative
history,
that
they
were
denied
equal
protection
in
the
state
court.
that
is
all
that
is.
it
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
language
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
if
the
court
decides
to
address--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--justice
stevens,
i
would
sorely
disagree
with
you
because
not
only
do
they
say
due
process,
but
they
say
we
were
denied
equal
protection
because--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--with
regard
to
the
royalty
owner
exemption,
no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
let
me
reiterate.
there
were
only
two
changes
in
the
statute
ten
months
later;
one,
the
anti
pass-through
prohibition
was
deleted,
and
a
method
of
reporting
on
the
unitization
method
was
added.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
yes,
sir,
same
rate
of
tax.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
see
it
that
way.
i
think
that
a
50
%
working-interest
owner
would
still
pay
at
the
rate
of
two
percent
and
a
75
%
owner--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying
honestly.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
well,
with
regard
to
that
answer--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
no,
sir.
the
oil
companies
for
lessees...
the
testimony
in
the
volumes
of
record
go
from
anywhere
from
1/8
to
1/16
to
1/32.
it
is
just
whatever
the
market
will
bear.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
as
the
income
tax
burdens
people
with
a
higher
income
than
people
who
make
less.
the
legislature
has
the
discretion
to
set
the
rate
of
tax
and
they
can
decide...
they
have
the
clear--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
don't
think
a
royalty
owner
is
a
producer
under
the
increase.
i
disagree
with
that
assertion
right
away.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
if
you
construe
it
my
way?
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
say
the
royalty
owner
for
the
two
percent
increase
is
not
a
producer
so
it
would
not--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--if
they
all
pay
two
percent
on
their
production
and
one
producer
produces
more,
is
a
larger
producer
than
the
others,
i
don't
see
how
that
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
smaller
producer
could
produce
more.
i
could
make
$1
million
and
pay
income
on
$1
million
or
i
could...
i
don't
see
where
that
is
denial
of
equal
protection.
what
we
are
doing
here
is
so
long
as
you
treat
every
member
of
the
class
or
subclass
the
same
you
are
not
denying
them
equal
protection.
if
you
keep
royalty
owners,
all
of
the
royalty
owners
one
way
and
all
the
producers
another
way,
but
so
long
as
you
treat
them
the
same,
you
are
not
violating
equal
protection.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
they
say
both.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
think
they
did.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
yes,
i
think
it
was,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
yes.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
none
come
to
mind.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
that
is
correct.
the
one
that
comes
readily
to
mind
in
alabama
is
the
coal
severance
tax
that
is
levied
on
producers.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
as
i
understand
justice
stevens'
example,
what
we...
he
says
you
seemed
to
be
treating
smaller
producers
at
a
different
rate
than
the
larger
producers.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
but,
then,
they
are
different.
they
are
smaller
producers.
we
are
not
saying
they
are
different.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
disagree,
because--
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
--i
disagree,
because
they
can't...
neither
one
of
them
can
pass
a
law
on
the
increase
to
the
royalty
owner.
they
are
both
going
to
bear
100
%
of
the
tax.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
think
the
court...
the
statute
does
not
say
that
at
all.
the
statute
says
the
increase
in
the
severance
tax
will
be
borne
by
the
producer
and
shall
not
be
passed
along
to
the
royalty
owner.
so,
the
fact
that
he
has
got...
the
producer
is
going
to
pay
100
%
of
the
severance
tax
on
the
amount
of
oil
and
gas
that
he
severs
and
the
fact
that
he
has
got
a
royalty
owner
and
one
of
his
competitors
does
not
have
to
share
his
proceeds
with
a
royalty
owner
does
not
mean
that
they
are
being
denied
equal
protection.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
i
don't
believe
by
paying
the
severance
tax
will
cause
them
to
lose
it.
at
any
rate,
he
is
going
to
pay
the
same
rate.
i
believe
that
if
i
pay
income
tax
that
i
am
going
to
pay
a
different
rate
than
somebody
else
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
will
wind
up
with
less
money
than
someone
else,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
i
am
being
denied
equal
protection
by
the
income
tax
laws.
mr.
john
j.
breckenridge
the
appellants
exchange
and
getty
and
union
have
raised
up
here
again
the
question
of
whether
the
alabama
statute
is
a
local
law
or
a
general
law.
we
feel
like
the
state
of
alabama
has
the
ultimate
competence
to
answer
that
question
and
we
feel
like
the...
the
commission
feels
like
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
answered
that
question
fully.
before
i
finish,
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
severability
clause
though.
if
the
court
decides
to
agree
with
appellants
with
regard
to
the
pre-emption
question
and
the
anti
pass-through
prohibition,
it
is
the
position
of
the
commissioner
of
revenue
that
the
case
must
be
sent
back
down
to
alabama
to
determine
the
effects
of
the
state's
severability
clause.
and,
we
would
also
like
to
say
that
appellant
exxon
and
gulf
and
louisiana
land
and
exploration
have
drawn
the
analogy
that
the
royalty
owner
exemption
and
the
anti
pass-through
prohibition
are
the
same
and
they
are
not.
the
royalty
owner
exemption
says
that
the
producer
is
prohibited
from
passing
the
tax
along
to
the
royalty
owner
and
it
says
that
the
royalty
owner's
interest
is
exempt
from
the
tax
is
what
it
says.
the
anti
pass-through
prohibition
says
that
the
producer
cannot
pass
the
tax
along
to
the
consumer.
the
royalty
owner
is
not
the
consumer
of
the
gas.
what
he
is,
he
is
a
lessor
usually
or
contributes
in
some
manner,
investing
in
the
drilling
of
the
well.
to
say
that
the
royalty
owner
is
in
the
same
position
as
the
consumer
is
a
gross
distortion
of
the
facts
in
the
opinion
of
the
commissioner
of
revenue.
