justice

that
means
the
working
interest,
i
think.
justice

normally.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
two
percent
specifically
excluded
the
royalty
owner...
the
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
else
can
you
win
this
case
except
on
a
federal
constitutional
ground
such
as
preemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
did
you
present
all
of
those
to
the
alabama
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
returning
to
justice
o'connor's
question
of
a
while
ago,
if
the
commissioner...
the
state
commissioner
is
correct
that
the
law
does
not
permit
pass-throughs,
as
long
as
you
do
not
say
you
are
passing
through
the
tax
in
so
many
words,
do
you
think
there
is
any
necessary
conflict
with
the
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that.
i
just
said
if
he
is
correct.
now,
let's
just
suppose...
just
suppose
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
expressly
said,
this
law
does
not
forbid
pass-throughs
as
long
as
you
do
not
call
what
you
are
passing
through
a
tax
expressly.
now
suppose
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
had
said
that.
would
you
be
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
still
be
making
your
equal
protection
contract
clause
arguments?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
be
making
your
preemption
arguments?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
say
you
may
pass-through
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
say
yes.
you
would
still
be
here
on
the
other
two
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that
is
the
purpose,
i
would
think
it
would
violate
the
prohibition
of
the
alabama
law
however
you
showed
the
severance
tax
on
your
bill.
if
you
put
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
and
say,
by
the
way,
two
cents
of
the
above
$1.02
charge
is
severance
tax,
i
would
think
you
are
right
in
the
teeth
of
the
purpose
of
the
alabama
law.
you
are
then
telling
the
consumer,
don't
blame
the
feds,
blame
the
legislature.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
assumes
you
get
by
the
other
grounds
that
would
invalidate
the
two
cent
tax,
the
two
cent
increase.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
equal
protection
and
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
pre-emption
ground
wouldn't
question
the
validity
of
the
two
cent
increase?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
see,
the
reason
i
said...
suppose
we
thought
that
the
pass-through
provisions
were
invalid
under
the
ngpa--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wouldn't
we
still...
would
we
still
have
to
pass
on
the
equal
protection
and
the
contract
clause
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
equal
protection?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
wouldn't
we
have
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wouldn't
we
have
to
address
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
are
right
on
the
equal
protection,
if
that
issue
is
properly
here,
and
if
they
are
right
on
it,
it
means
that
the
two
cent
exclusion
of
the
royalty
owner
is
unconstitutional,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
to
decide
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
exemption
is
for
royalty
interest,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
another
standard
royalty
rate
in
alabama?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
justice
stevens
has
to
be
correct,
doesn't
he,
that
if
the
tax
is
paid
by
the
working
interest
and
the
royalty
interests
are
exempt,
then
this
tax
burdens
some
producers
more
than
others.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
breckenridge,
do
your
opponents
say
base
their
equal
protection
argument
on
the
discrimination
among
producers
or
do
they
say
that
you
may
not
exempt
royalty
owners?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
say
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
--aren't
there
a
lot
of
severance
taxes
that
just
hit
the
working
interests
around
the
country
and
exempt--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
is
not
unheard
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
is
not
unheard
of
to
exempt
royalty
owners
from
severance
tax
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
true,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
equal
protection
argument
insofar
that
it
is
based
on
a
discrimination
among
producers.
justice
byron
r.
white
two
producers
producing
exactly
the
same
amount
of
oil
are
going
to
pay
different
amounts
of
tax
or
they
are
going
to
pay
the
same
amount
of
tax,
but
they
have
less
economic
interest
in
the
oil
that
is
produced,
one
of
them
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
tax
is
going
to
be
more
burdensome.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be...
that
may
be
so,
but
if
i
am
delivering
tax
free
to
the
royalty
owner
50
%
and
still
paying
$100,000
severance
tax,
and
my
competitor
is
delivering
only
25
%
tax
free.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
just
suggest
to
you
that
two
producers
in
the
position
that
justice
stevens
posited
to
you
one
of
them
is
going
to
end
up...
one
of
them
is
going
to
end
up
with
less
money
in
his
pocket
than
the
other.
