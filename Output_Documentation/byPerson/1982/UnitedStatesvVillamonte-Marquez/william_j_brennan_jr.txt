justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
alito,
you
have
been
addressing
the
merits
from
the
beginning.
what
about
mootness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
it
the
government
that
got
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
instead
of
a
dismissal,
couldn't
you
have
sought
a
stay
of
mandate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
you
waive
reinstatement
by
the
course
you
took,
dismissing
instead
of
getting
a
stay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
still
don't
understand.
why
did
the
government
seek
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not
a
stay
of
the
mandate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
was
it...
why
was
dismissal
sought?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
had
the
impression
it
was
on
the
government's
motion.
me,
too.
am
i
wrong?
the
government
can't
dismiss
the
indictment,
can
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
alito.
may
i
ask
you,
in
that
respect,
did
the
government
argue
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
no
reasonable
suspicion
was
required
or
only
that
the
officers
in
fact
had
reasonable
suspicion?
which
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
did
you
argue?
did
you
argue
one
or
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
that,
the
original
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
alito,
that
your
asserted
power
to
board
without
reasonable
suspicion
would
not
apply
in
the
case
of
boats
not
capable
of
going
to
sea,
for
example,
like
river
barges
and
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
it
is
a
barge
incapable
of
going
to
sea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
they
could
board
those
under
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
would
it
make
any
difference,
for
example,
if
it
is
on
waters
that
don't
empty
into
the
seas,
a
lake
or
something
like
that?
they
can
still
do
all
this?
