mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honors,
the
boarding
of
the
henry
morgan
ii
was
pursuant
to
19
usc
1581.
this
statute
grants
government
agents
broader
powers
of
search
and
seizure
than
any
statute
which
has
previously
come
before
the
court
for
constitutional
consideration.
it
is
even
broader
than
the
statute
that
was
before
the
court
in
brignoni-ponce,
because
in
that
particular
situation
there
was
at
least
a
geographic
limitation
on
the
powers
of
border
controls
to
conduct
roving
and
random
patrols
and
stops
of
vehicles
near
the
border
with
mexico.
there
are
absolutely
no
limitations
within
the
statute
on
the
powers
of
customs
agents
to
seize
or
search
vessels
and
vehicles.
the
agents
may
stop,
board,
and
search
any
vessel,
any
time,
any
place
in
the
united
states.
therefore,
the
time,
place,
manner,
and
scope
of
the
boarding
and
search
of
the
vessel
is
left
to
the
unbridled
discretion
of
the
agent
in
the
field,
which
this
court
has
always
considered
as
an
evil
in
this
type
of
case.
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeal
was
that
the
reasonableness
standard
of
the
fourth
amendment
required
that
customs
agents
possess
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
law
violation
before
boarding
a
vessel
in
inland
waters
pursuant
to
19
usc
1581.
there
was
a
limitation
on
these
broad
powers
that
were
placed...
that
customs
agents
enjoyed
placed
on
it
by
the
fifth
circuit.
i
think
very
definitely
that
the
true
nature
of
this
particular
patrol
is
important
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
insofar
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
this
patrol
was
instigated
and
executed
because
of
information
which
a
customs
agent
had
received
on
the
prior
day,
on
march
5th,
1980,
that
there
were
two
vessels
in
the
hackberry,
louisiana,
area
laden
with
marijuana.
pursuant
to
that
information,
this
patrol
was
formed,
which
included
not
only
u.s.
customs
agents,
but
included
louisiana
state
police
narcotics
agents.
in
fact,
this
was
not
a
mere
administrative
search
for
documents.
this
was
clearly
an
investigatory,
a
criminal
investigatory
search
that
was
made
in
order
to
obtain
evidence
to
substantiate
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
very
significant,
because
if
the
search
was
primarily
one
to
obtain
criminal
evidence
to
support
a
criminal
prosecution,
the
competing
interests
of
the
government
and
the
individual
are
changed.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
only...
only
the
facts
that
were
adduced
at
the
trial,
your
honor,
indicates
that.
as
i
stated,
the
patrol
was
formed
basically--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no.
i
don't
think
that
either
of
the
lower
courts
did
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
don't
think
they
were
requested
to
do
so,
your
honor,
but
the
testimony
that
was
taken
at
trial
clearly
reflected
that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that
is
really
what
i
am
emphasizing
here.
well,
in
that
respect,
i
wanted
to
bring
out,
however,
the
true
nature
of
it,
because
this
court
on
many
other
occasions--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
think
the
objective
facts
of
this
particular
case
indicate
that
it
was
a
criminal
search.
first
of
all,
the
presence
of
the
louisiana
narcotics
agents
in
the
patrol,
his
presence
can
only
be
explained
by
the
very
fact
that
it
was
a
criminal
search
seeking
to
obtain
evidence
for
a
criminal
prosecution.
there
is
no
other
explanation
for
his
presence
there
except
that
fact.
and
as
i
stated
before,
they
were
looking
for
marijuana.
that
was
the
reason
why
the
patrol
was
ever
formed,
and
why
the
boarding
was
executed.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
they
certainly,
your
honor,
do
not
have
the
right
to
board
under
19
usc
1581.
there
is
a
federal
statute
which
was
cited
by
the
government,
i
think
19
usc
507.
however,
this
particular
statute,
the
very
nature
of
it
indicates
that
congress
intended
that
any
assistance
given
by
a
person
to
customs
agents
in
that
particular
respect
was
for
the
furtherance
of
a
criminal
search,
or
a
search
in
criminal
cases.
so,
at
least
under
the
federal
regulations
or
federal
statutes,
state
narcotics
agents
do
not
have
the
right
to
board
a
vessel.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
did
not
specifically
ask
him
that
question.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
i
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
he--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--correct.
his
testimony
did
indicate,
however,
that
they
were
looking
for
marijuana.
his
testimony
did
indicate
that.
but--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
in
this
case
if
you
take
all
of
the
facts
as
they
are
presented,
and
as
the
testimony
indicated,
that
it
should
lead
to
a
conclusion,
your
honors,
that
it
was
in
fact
a
criminal
investigatory
search.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
think
they
could
have
done
that,
your
honor.
the
question,
i
think,
in
this
case
was
whether
or
not
the
boarding
was
legal,
and
not
whether
or
not...
although
i
did
contest
that
the
search
that
took
place
after
the
boarding
was
illegal.
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
decide
that
particular
question.
the
fifth
circuit
only
held
that
the
boarding
itself
was
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
situation...
even
if
we
assume
that
the
government,
as
the
government
contends,
that
the
boarding
in
this
case
was
purely
an
administrative
documentation
check,
only
in
very
unique
and
limited
circumstances
may
even
an
administrative
inspection
or
search
of
private
premises
be
accomplished
with
an
administrative
warrant...
without
an
administrative
warrant
or
without
a
valid
substitute
therefore.
i
think
the
government
tried
to
argue
that
this
particular
inspection
fell
under
the
colonnade-biswell
exception.
but
this
particular
exception
was
a
very
narrow
exception
to
the
general
rule,
which
requires
a
warrant
for
administrative
inspections
of
residential
and
commercial
premises.
the
exception
allowed
warrantless
regulatory
searches
of
a
pervasively
regulated
business
to
further
an
urgent
federal
interest,
by
statute.
however,
the
statute
is
very
limiting
in
these
particular
types
of
cases.
the
statute
limits
the
time,
scope,
and
place
of
these
types
of
searches,
and
unless
you
have
a
valid
statute
which
carefully
and
narrowly
limits
these
particular
inspections,
then
you
need
either
an
administrative
warrant
or
some
substitution
for
an
administrative
warrant,
which
we
suggest
in
this
case
would
be
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
law
violation.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
i
think
insofar
as
that
is
concerned,
that
vessels,
with
respect
to
your
particular
answer,
vessels
are
not
that
much
different
in
mobility
certainly
than
automobiles
are.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
in--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
in
united
states
versus
demanett,
which
was
a
lower
court
case,
they
were
faced
with
that
particular
proposition.
in
fact,
the
same
proposition
has
been
cited
by
the
government
here.
and
that
particular
court
held,
there
has
to
be
some
way
other
than
complete
unbridled
discretion
in
the
hands
of
the
agent
in
the
field.
they
did
not
rule
out
some
type
of
border
or
some
type
of
check
point
search.
they
did
not
rule
that
out.
and
certainly
in
the
calcasieu
ship
channel,
which
is
not
a
very
wide
body
of
water
at
all,
there
certainly
could
have
been
that
type
of
thing
in
the
calcasieu
ship
channel,
where
this
particular
vessel
was
sited.
there
could
have
been
a
check
point
type
situation.
besides
that,
insofar
as
the
documentation
checks
go,
and
insofar
as
the
documentation
laws
and
other
regulatory
objectives
of
this
particular
statute
go,
the
minimal
or
the
minimum...
it
certainly
would
not
benefit
that
much,
random,
suspicionless,
warrantless
boardings
of
vessels
would
not
necessarily
benefit
the
documentation
laws
to
such
an
extent
that
it
would
outweigh
the
tremendous
possibility
of
abuse
and
threat
to
the
privacy
of
the
individual
that
this
statute
allows.
i
think
in
biswell,
the
court
stated
that
if
the
statute
offers
a
great
possibility
of
abuse,
and
there
is
a
tremendous
threat
to
the
privacy
of
the
individual,
then
you
cannot
fall
within
the
colonnade-biswell
exception.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
using
the
rationale
that
the
court
used
in--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
first
of
all,
the
check
point
can
be
seen
by
all
the
vessels.
there
is
less
of
a
subjective
intrusion.
there
is
less
fear
that
might
be
engendered
when
you
see
a
check
point
where
other
vessels
are
being
stopped.
there
is
a
regular
pattern
that
is
followed
in
stopping
all
of
the
vessels
that
may
be
coming
into
a
particular
point.
and
in
that
respect,
it
follows
the
martinez-fuerte
rationale,
that
permanent
check
points
are
not
as
much
an
intrusion
into
the
privacy
of
the
individual
as
a
roving
patrol
that
makes
random
suspicionless
searches.
and
that
is
the
difference
between
the
check
point
and
any
of...
the
random
searches.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
so.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
had
a
regular,
a
set
check
point,
that
that
might
be
all
right
under
the
martinez-fuerte
rationale.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
at
least
they
could
have
in
this--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
i
have
never
seen
one,
your
honor.
that
is
an
alternative
that
would
be
available.
but
certainly
there
has
to
be
some
alternative
other
than
subjecting
every
person
that
is
in
inland
waters
lawfully,
either
for
recreational
purposes
or
vacational
purposes,
to
random,
suspicionless,
dragnet-type
searches.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
this--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
yes,
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--insofar
as
the
border
search
is
concerned,
your
honor,
there
is
no
right
to
privacy,
and
that
has
been
historically
true,
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
so
held
for
many
years,
but
this
was
not
a
border
search,
and
insofar
as
this
particular
body
of
water
was
concerned,
it
covers
an
area
of
35
statute
miles
from
lake
charles,
louisiana,
to
the
coast
of
louisiana.
this
vessel
was
18
miles
inland,
and
there
are
many
pleasure
vessels
that
ply
that
particular
waterway.
there
definitely
is,
but--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
in
that
particular
case,
though,
you
have
a
set
point
of
customs
or
border
inspections.
i
think
in
this
particular
case
the
border
rationale
would
be
applicable.
in
that
case,
if
they
flew
from
a
foreign
country
and
landed
at
a
particular
point
in
the
united
states,
where
there
were
regular
inspections
and
regular
searches,
i
think
the
border
search
rationale
would
apply,
as
it
did
in
ramsey.
in
ramsey--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
in
that
particular
case,
your
honor,
it
would,
first
of
all,
seem
very
unusual
for
a
very
small
plane
to
be
flying
in
from
mexico
and
flying
at
a
very--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
it
may
not
be
unusual,
however,
i
think,
but
those
particular
facts
might
give
rise
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
law
violation,
and--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
i
think
in
a
particular
situation
where
there
is
a
plane,
and
a
plane
is
different
than,
i
think,
a
vessel
in
this
particular
case.
if
a
plane
flies
in
from
mexico
into
the
united
states,
and
even
if
it
is
400
miles
from
the
border,
i
think
the
border
rationale,
the
border
search
rationale
could
apply.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that
way.
in
fact,
i
think
it
was
in
united
states
versus
whittaker
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
customs
agent
sited
the
vessel
off
the
coast,
and
kept
it
under
surveillance,
and
during
the
course
of
the
surveillance
there
were
certain
articulable
facts
which
were
generated
because
of
the
nature
of
the
boat,
the
type
of
the
spray
that
it
was
throwing,
the
sluggish
nature
of
its
movement.
they
followed
her
inland
and
then
boarded
her,
and
the
fifth
circuit
said,
that's
fine.
you
can
do
that,
because
you
saw
the
border
crossing.
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
just
held
that
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
to
establish
a
border
crossing
here.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct.
there
was
absolutely
no
facts.
when
the
boat
was
initially
sited,
your
honor,
it
was
anchored.
it
was
anchored
18
miles
inland
in
the
calcasieu
ship
channel.
the
sails
were
furled.
there
were
no
persons
on
board.
there
was
absolutely
no
activity
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
it
is
very
close
by,
your
honor.
it
is
not
the
calcasieu
ship
channel,
but
it
is
very
close
by,
and
officer
wilkins,
incidentally,
testified
that
there
are
hundreds
of
pleasure
vessels
in
calcasieu
lake
which
would
have
access
to
the
calcasieu
ship
channel.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
it
was
just
a
registration,
your
honor,
i
think,
that...
showing
where
the
vessel
was
purchased,
where
the
vessel
was
made
and
where
the
vessel
was
purchased.
there
is
something,
i
think,
that
is
very
interesting
here.
one
of
the
officers
testified
at
trial
that
the
decision
was
made
before
they
even
started
the
patrol
that
every
vessel
in
the
calcasieu
ship
channel
was
going
to
be
boarded.
they
didn't
care
whether
or
not--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
it
helps
me,
i
think,
your
honor,
in
showing
that
there
is
a
tremendous
amount
of
possibility
of
abuse.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
no,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
in
a
random--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--a
random
search,
your
honor,
is
what
it
was.
a
random
patrol.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
but
there
is
not
the
regularity
that
a
roadblock
would
have.
people
would
not
be
able
to
see
that
other
vessels
were
being
stopped
necessarily.
they
were
roaming
the
entire
area
of
the
calcasieu
ship
channel,
35
miles.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
that
was
their
purpose.
the
record
doesn't
reflect
whether
or
not
they
actually
did.
but
they
did
site
this
particular
vessel.
but
the
broadness
of
this
particular
statute
is
very
important,
because
the
court
has
always
held
that
whenever
there
is
unbridled
discretion
in
the
hands
of
the
officer
in
the
field,
then
you
have
a
problem
here,
and
this
particular
statute
does
not
make
any
provision
whatsoever
concerning
the
procedures
that
are
to
be
used
when
these
boardings
take
place.
now,
the
government
has
said,
well,
this
boarding
only
deals
with
the
weather
decks
or
the
places
that
you
can
see.
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
the
statute
simply
says
that
you
can
board
and
examine
the
documents
and
the
manifest.
you
can
board
and
inspect
and
search
the
vessel.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor,
i
am
challenging
it
as
it
was--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--it
was
unreasonable
under
the
constitution,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct.
the
basis...
what
was
the
basis
of
the
particular...
what
was
the
constitutional
basis
of
the
search?
the
government
is
saying
that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--of
the
boarding.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
of
the
boarding.
that's
correct.
they're
saying,
well,
this
was
an
administrative
documentation
check.
but
the
rule
is
that
unless
it
falls
under
a
very
narrow
exception,
a
search
of
private
property
must
be
conducted
either
with
an
administrative
warrant
or
a
substitution,
or--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
but
congress
cannot
authorize
the
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--the
record
shows
that
they
boarded...
i
contend
that
they
boarded
in
order
to
conduct
a
search.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
the
record
would
show
that,
too,
your
honor,
but
they
did
board,
and
then
supposedly
they
saw...
they
smelled
marijuana,
looked
toward
the
hold,
and
there
were
some
burlap
sacks.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
i
don't
have
anything
to--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
that
is
what...
that's
what
the
testimony,
that's
what
the
testimony
reflected.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
the
boarding
itself.
the
boarding
itself.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
very
possibly
they
could
have
boarded,
yes.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
the
record
absolutely
doesn't
reflect
that
they
smelled
it
before
they
boarded
the
vessel,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
the
record
does
show
that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
am
saying,
your
honor--
0
[generallaughter.]
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
board
the
vessel
in
the
first
place.
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
board
the
vessel--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--even
an
administrative
search.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
not
at
random.
not
roving
patrols,
of
border
patrols.
in
brignoni-ponce
the
court
made
that
very
clear.
because
you
are
subjecting
numerous
people
who
are
lawfully
on
the
highways
to
interruption
of
their
freedom
of
passage,
and
that's
what
happens
when
you
have
this
random
border
patrol.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
or
right
to
travel.
absolutely,
your
honor.
right
to
travel.
right
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
governmental
interference
in
your
passage.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
that's
correct.
he's
covered
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
he
came
from
colombia.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
colombia,
your
honor.
colombia.
he
did
come
from
colombia.
but
just
because
the
government
says,
well,
we
have
a
right
to
inspect
documentation,
doesn't
mean
that
that
is
going
to
be
constitutional.
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
carte
blanche
just
to
stop
either
any
vessel
or
either...
or
vehicle
just
to
check
the
documentation.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
if
it
entailed--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--it
depends
on
whether
it
was
a
stop.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
it
is
interfering.
it
depends--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--not
unless
he
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
initially
to
make
the
stop.
the
issue
is,
can
the
stop
be
made?
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
he
had
already
stopped.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
he
was
anchored.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
that
would
be
a
minimal
intrusion.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
that
would
definitely
be
a
minimal
intrusion.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
what
i
think
that
the
government
is
trying
to
do
in
this
particular
case
is
convert
19
usc
1581
into
a
writ
of
assistance
that
gives
customs
agents
total
power
to
do
anything
they
want
insofar
as
vessel
checks
are
concerned
without
any
fourth
amendment
or
constitutional
constraints,
and
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do
in
this
particular
case.
and
the
possibility
that
this
will
lead
to
abuse
is
very
real.
they
don't
have
the
right
to
conduct
random,
suspicionless,
warrantless
stops,
whether
it
be
for
a
documentation
check,
or
for
a
safety
check,
or
what
have
you.
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
here.
the
standard
of
reasonableness
applies.
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases,
in
brignoni-ponce,
in
almeida-sanchez,
and
other
cases,
that
the
random...
this
discretion,
the
unbridled,
unconstrained
discretion
in
the
hands
of
the
officer
in
the
field
is
what
is
very
important
insofar
as
the
application
of
the
reasonableness
standard
to
the
fourth--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
i
think
insofar
as
three
miles
from
the
coast
is
concerned,
your
honor,
that
there
could
have
possibly
been
a
border
type...
a
border
search
rationale
applied.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
i
think
if
it
is
that
close
to--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
think
it
can
be
a
matter
of
degree.
if
you
are
right
at
the
coast,
if
you
are
one
mile--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
not
any
time
you
cross
the
border,
your
honor,
no.
if
there--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
i'm
just...
i'm
just
saying
that
there's
a
possibility
the
court
of
appeal
might
have
found
that
this...
if
it
had
been
three
miles,
or
closer
to
the
border,
there
may
have
been
a
border
search
rationale
applied,
because--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
that
would
be
unreasonable,
your
honor.
that
would
be
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor.
not
a
permanent
check
point
or
an
inspection
station.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
unreasonable.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
i
think...
your
honor,
i
think
that
might
be
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
certainly,
they--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
would
say
the
border
of
the
united
states,
the
coast
of
the
united
states,
is
three
miles...
there's
a--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
think
it's
three
miles
off
the
coast,
your
honor,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
so.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
it's
customs
waters.
i
think
that's
referred
to
customs
waters,
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
if
i...
i
think
so.
i'm
not
sure
about
that
point,
your
honor.
it
may
be
12
miles
off
the
coast.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
at
a
permanent
type
check
point,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
if
they
find--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--if
they
find
marijuana,
then
the
person
is
subject
to
being
arrested
and
prosecuted.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
this
is
a
roving
patrol,
random
type
search
that
leaves--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
the
only
difference,
too,
your
honor,
is
that
it
is...
it
was
made
pursuant--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor.
there
is
also
a
difference
in
that
it
was
made
pursuant
to
a
federal
statute
which
grants
broad
powers
of
search
and
seizure
which
are
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
this
was
a
random
search
by
a
roving
patrol,
and
i
think
this
court
in
prior
decisions
has
held
that
this
is
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
thank
you.
