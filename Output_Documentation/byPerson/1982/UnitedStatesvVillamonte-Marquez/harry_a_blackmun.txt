harry

certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
in
so
many
words
said
that
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
put
it
another
way.
i
suppose
you
feel
that
the
indictment
is
merged
in
the
judgment
in
any
event.
that's
what
your
brief
says.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
that's
a
good
way
of
describing
it.
