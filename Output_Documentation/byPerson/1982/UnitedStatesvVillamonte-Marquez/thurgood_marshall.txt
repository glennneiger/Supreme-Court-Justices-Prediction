justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
don't
dismiss
the
indictment.
they
just
don't
prosecute
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
told
justice
stevens
that
you
couldn't
name
a
single
case
where
the
indictment
was
dismissed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
say
it
if
you
can't
name
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
narcotics
agent
testify?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
ask
him
that
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
did,
you
could
have
found
out,
couldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
didn't
ask,
and
you
ask
us
to
draw
a
conclusion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
you
could
have
brought
out
of
the
witness.
justice
thurgood
marshall
indicate
is
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
indicate
is
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
check
point
in
the
canal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
seen
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
with
that,
but
at
least--
--they
didn't
board
to
search.
they
did
not
board
to
search.
they
didn't
search
until
they
saw
in
plain
view
the
contraband,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
what
the
record
shows?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about...
not
you.
i'm
talking
about
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
anything
to
dispute
that
they
did
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
say
supposed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
say
supposed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
they
did.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
didn't
board
to
search.
they
searched
after
they
saw.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
is
wrong
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
they'd
passed
by
the
boat
and
had
smelled
it,
could
they
have
boarded
it
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
they
very
possibly
have
done
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know,
i
am
with
you
on
one
point.
i
don't
understand
these
crooks
that
always
leave
everything
out
in
plain
view.
0
[generallaughter.]
but
the
record
shows
it
was
in
plain
view.
that's
what
the
record
shows.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
away
from
that.
they
had
a
right
to
look
for
the
papers
of
that
boat.
they
had
that
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
while
they
were
looking
for
the
papers
of
the
boat,
they
saw
marijuana
on
every
place
except
nailed
to
the
mast.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
look
to
see
whether
it
was
papered
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
right
to
stop
a
car
to
see
if
it
is
registered?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
right
to
travel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
man...
there's
only
one
man
on
the
boat.
he
couldn't
speak
english.
he
had
the
right
to
travel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
he
come
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
even
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
stop
by,
take
his
bullhorn,
and
say,
have
you
got
papers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
say
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
interfering
with
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
here
he
had
already
stopped.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
he
have
asked
him,
do
you
have
papers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
over
the
bullhorn,
could
he
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you
for
agreeing
to
one
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
few
minutes
ago
you
said
it's
all
right
to
stop
and
search
for
bugs
and
things.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
while
they
are
looking
for
it
they
find
marijuana.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
they
find
marijuana.
justice
thurgood
marshall
while
they
were
searching
the
lettuce.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
only
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
difference,
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
on
that,
will
you
please
put
in
a
copy
of
your
order
which
the
u.s.
attorney
filed,
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
right
here
in
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
doesn't
say...
it
just
says
he's
the
one.
if
it
hadn't
been
for
him,
it
wouldn't
have
been
done.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
some
cases
pending
on
that,
isn't
that
correct,
down
in
florida?
