does
this
case
fit
within
the
border
exception?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
that
the
foreign
registration
of
the
vessel
would
not
be
sufficient,
i
mean,
the
obvious
markings
from
the
outside
of
the
vessel
showing
it's
a
foreign
vessel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
fit
within
a
traditional
border
search
exception
as
cause
to
believe
that
the
vessel
had
had
foreign
contacts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
underlying
basis
for
this
authority
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
govern
entry
into
this
country
from
beyond
our
borders
of
foreign
goods
and
vessels?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
primary
thrust?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
is
just
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
it
should
extend,
for
instance,
to
a
full
right
to
board
and
search
a
small
pleasure
boat
on
an
inland
lake.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
a
rule
that
is
limited
to
the
open
seas
or
adjacent
waterways
and
customs--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes,
but
you
are
arguing
for
a
much
broader
rule,
if
i
understood
you
correctly.
you
certainly
did
in
answer
to
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
different
factors
that
play,
though,
when
you
are
dealing
with
vessels
on
open
waters
which
just
don't
lend
themselves
to
staying
put
long
enough
to
go
get
your
administrative
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but,
of
course,
with
vessels
we
don't
have
roads.
they
go
anyplace
that
there
is
open
water,
and
it
makes
it...
you
can't
put
up
a
roadblock,
like
you
could
for
automobiles,
to
check
registrations
and
licenses.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
how
do
you
deal
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
this
isn't
really
the
inland
water
situation,
though,
here,
is
it?
it
is
the
extension
of
the
open
sea,
and
in
customs
waters,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
would
also
agree
that
there
is
no
real
right
of
privacy,
is
there,
for
anyone
entering
our
borders
from
abroad?
