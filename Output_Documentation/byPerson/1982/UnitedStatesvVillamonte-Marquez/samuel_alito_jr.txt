mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
since
before
the
adoption
of
the
fourth
amendment,
customs
officers
have
been
authorized
by
federal
statute
to
conduct
suspicionless
boardings
of
vessels
for
the
purpose
of
checking
their
documents.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
such
boardings
in
inland
waters
constitute
unreasonable
searches
or
seizures.
the
facts
of
this
case
may
be
briefly
summarized.
at
about
11:30
in
the
morning,
in
march,
1980,
a
patrolling
customs
officer
spotted
a
40-foot
sailboat
equipped
with
a
diesel
engine,
anchored
about
18
miles
inland,
in
the
calcasieu
river
ship
channel,
which
is
a
waterway
connecting
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
the
customs
port
of
entry
at
lake
charles,
louisiana.
the
officer
and
those
on
board
his
boat
had
never
before
seen
a
sailboat
in
that
waterway,
which
is
traveled
by
large
commercial
vessels.
on
the
stern
of
the
sailboat
was
the
name
of
the
vessel,
the
henry
morgan
ii,
and
its
hailing
port,
"basilea",
which
it
turns
out
is
the
latin
translation
for
basel,
switzerland.
although
the
officer
did
not
recognize
the
name
"basilea",
he
correctly
believed
that
it
denoted
a
foreign
port.
at
this
time,
a
large
freighter
was
heading
up
the
ship
channel,
and
it
created
a
huge
wake
that
caused
the
sailboat
to
rock
so
violently
back
and
forth
that
it
appeared
it
was
about
to
capsize.
in
fact,
at
one
point
the
sailboat's
mast
actually
touched
the
water,
and
its
keel
emerged
from
the
water.
the
customs
officer
called
out
to
respondent
hamparian,
who
was
the
only
person
visible
on
deck,
and
asked
if
he
was
all
right,
but
hamparian
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders,
which
suggested
to
the
officer
that
he
was
unable
to
speak
english.
the
officer
then
decided
to
board
the
vessel
for
the
purpose
of
checking
the
documents.
he
did
so,
and
while
examining
the
documents,
he
detected
the
odor
of
burning
marijuana.
he
also
saw
through
an
open
hatch
burlap-wrapped
bales
of
what
he
believed
was
marijuana.
the
respondents
were
then
arrested.
the
boat
was
searched.
fifty-eight
hundred
pounds
of
marijuana,
with
a
street
value
of
about
$7
million,
was
seized.
respondents
were
convicted
of
drug
offenses,
but
their
convictions
were
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity,
and
therefore
the
officer
was
prohibited
from
boarding
the
vessel
in
inland
waters
for
the
purpose
of
checking
the
documents.
with
these
facts
in
mind,
it
bears
emphasis
that
the
only
authority
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
authority
to
board
the
vessel
and
check
the
documents,
and
not
the
authority
to
search
any
other
portion
of
the
craft.
it
also
bears
emphasis
that
the
henry
morgan
ii
was
not
a
small
american
boat
on
an
inland
lake.
it
was
a
seagoing
foreign
vessel
on
a
ship
channel
connecting
the
open
sea
with
the
customs
port
of
entry,
and
it
was
located
just
a
relatively
short
distance
from
the
open
sea.
our
position,
of
course,
is
that
suspicionless
boardings
and
inspections,
whether
on
inland
or
customs
waters,
are
reasonable,
and
therefore
do
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
strong
evidence
of
their
reasonableness
that
they
were
authorized
by
the
first
congress,
which
of
course
proposed
the
bill
of
rights
to
the
states,
and
they
have
been
continuously
authorized
by
statute
ever
since.
why
is
this
so?
first,
because
there
is
simply
no
other
adequate
alternative
way
of
enforcing
the
documentation
laws,
and
the
documentation
laws
serve
many
vital
functions.
they
are
the
primary
method
of
identifying
vessels.
they
serve
to
regulate
the
entry
and
departure
of
persons
and
goods
traveling
by
water.
they
are
used
in
collecting
import
and
tonnage
duties,
in
conserving
natural
resources,
and
promoting
safe
shipping
and
boating.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
your
honor,
this
case
is
certainly
not
moot.
both
sides
retain
legally
cognizable
interests
in
the
outcome
of
this
case.
if
the
decision
below
is
reversed,
and
respondent's
convictions
are
reinstated,
the
government
will
be
able
to
seek
their
extradition.
they
may
be
arrested
and
imprisoned
if
they
are
ever
found
in
the
united
states,
and
at
a
minimum,
reversal
of
the
decision
below
will
provide
grounds
for
their
exclusion--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--the
government
had
the
indictment
dismissed
merely
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
the
court
of
appeals
mandate,
but
i
think
this
court's
decisions
establish
that
ministerial
acts
of
that
sort,
which--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--we
could
have,
your
honor,
and
that
might
have
been
a
preferable
procedure,
but
it
is
merely
a
technical
matter.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
a
reversal
of
the
decision
below
would
permit
the
reinstatement
of
the
indictment
and
the
convictions,
and
therefore--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
think
you
just
reinstate
the
convictions.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
and
the
sentence.
and
then
if
they
are
ever
again
found--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that's
correct,
and
i
think
that's
what
would
happen.
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
was
purely
a
technical
matter,
and
it
would
certainly--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--justice
stevens,
i
must
confess,
i
don't
know
what
happens
as
a
technical
matter
to
the
indictment
when
the
conviction
is
reinstated,
but
i
think
that
when--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
i
see
no
reason
why
the
indictment
cannot
be
reinstated.
certainly
if
an
indictment
is
improperly
dismissed,
it
may
be
reinstated
when
that
decision
is
reversed.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
been
done
on
this
state
of
facts.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i'm
afraid
i
can't.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
certainly,
he
was.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
it
was
done...
it
was--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
won't
dispute
the
fact
that
that's
probably
the
preferable
alternative,
but
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--as
a
fact,
i
don't
know,
justice
brennan.
i
think
it
was
done
to
comply
with
the
court
of
appeals
mandate,
at
a
time
before
the
final
decision
to
seek
review
in
this
court
was
made.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
it
reversed
and
remanded
with
instructions
to
take
proceedings
consistent
with
the
decision,
and
since
the
principal
evidence
at
trial
was
the
evidence
that
had
been
suppressed,
i
believe
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
think
that's
correct.
otherwise,
we
would
have
to
seek
a
stay
in
every
case,
and
if
the
stay
was
denied,
every
stay
case
in
which
it
was
denied
would
have
to
go
up
to
this
court,
and
if
the
stay
was
not
granted,
the
case
would
become
moot.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
yes,
it
did.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
don't
know
on
whose
motion.
i
know
that
we
did
not
object
to
it.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
it
certainly
can't.
it
can
only
move
or
not
object
to
a
defense
motion.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
we
know
what
the
record
is.
i
don't
know--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--that
is
certainly
correct,
but
when...
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
when
the
convictions
are
founded
upon
the
discovery
of
contraband,
the
suppression
of
that
contraband
necessarily
means
that
there
will
no
longer
have
been--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
assume
there
was,
justice
white.
i
have
not
reviewed
it.
and
looking
here
at
the
docket
sheets,
it
is
not
clear
which
party
moved
for
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
respondent's
argument
on
mootness
is
not
based
on
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
it
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the...
that
respondents
had
been
deported,
and
it
is
for
that
reason--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
believe
the
dismissal--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
don't
think
i
can
say
more
than
that
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
was
merely
a
technical
matter,
done
to
comply
with
the
court
of
appeals
mandate.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
there
was
not
a
requirement
of
dismissing
the
indictment
in
a
legal
sense.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
would
have
meant
an
outstanding
indictment--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--which
would
have
called
for
a
trial
within
a
certain
amount
of
time
under
the
speedy
trial
act,
and
if
there
could
be
no
retrial,
which
in
fact
there
could
not
be,
unless
the
decision
suppressing
the
evidence
was
reversed--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--or
stayed,
then
compliance
with
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
as
a
practical
matter
would
have
necessitated
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
that's
right,
justice
stevens,
but
our
position
is
that
making
such
a
stay
motion
is
not
necessary
to
preserve
a
live
controversy.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
we
don't
have
authority
for
that
proposition
because
it
was
not
respondent's
contention
at
any
point
that
dismissal
of
the
indictment
was
what
mooted
this
case.
their
argument
was
that
deportation
is
what
mooted
the
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
at
the
minimum,
we
hope
to
make
authority
for
that,
justice
white.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
certainly
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
a
practical
matter,
suppression
of
the
evidence
meant
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
if
the
court
is
interested--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
i
believe
at
a
certain
point
there
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
can't
name
one
offhand.
we
would
be
happy
to
brief
the
issue.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
critical
evidence
is
suppressed
and
a
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court,
the
indictment
is
dismissed
because
a
new
trial
is
impractical,
and
that
was
what
happened
here,
and
i
am
sure
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
understood
was
going
to
happen
when
they
decided
this
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
there
are
cases
that
would
permit
reinstatement
of
the
complaint
after...
after
that.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
believe
if
that
was
done
truly
to
comply
with
the
mandate
of
an
appellate
court
reversing--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
if
the
practical
effect
of
the
appellate
ruling
is
to
make
any
further
proceedings
in
the
trial
court
impossible,
i
think--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--thank
you.
as
i
was
saying,
there
are
two
reasons
why
suspicionless
boardings
and
document
inspections
are
necessary.
first--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--we
certainly
raised
the
question
of
whether
reasonable
suspicion
was
required.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
we
argued...
in
our
petition
for
rehearing,
we
argued
both
points.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
initially
before
the
trial
we
merely
argued
that
reasonable
suspicion
was
present,
but
we
did
that
for
two
good
reasons.
first,
the
district
court
had
found
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion.
we
believed
he
was
correct.
we
still
believe
he
was
correct.
second,
and
more
important,
there
were
prior
binding
fifth
circuit
cases
holding
that
reasonable
suspicion
was
needed
for
boarding
in
inland
waters,
and
therefore
we
saw
no
need
to
urge
affirmance
of
the
district
court
decision
on
the
ground
that
prior
decisions
binding
on
the
panel
ought
to
be
reversed,
but
after
the
panel
rendered
its
decision,
then
we
raised
the
issue
of
whether
reasonable
suspicion
was
needed
in
our
petition
for
rehearing.
there
are
no
other
adequate
means
of
enforcing
the
documentation
laws
besides
suspicionless
boardings.
in
addition,
because
of
the
long
history
of
pervasive
federal
regulation
of
most
aspects
of
maritime
activity,
persons
aboard
vessels
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
have
a
greatly
reduced
expectation
of
privacy,
especially
with
respect
to
the
vessel's
documents.
let
me
first--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--it
does
not
fit
within
the
classic
border
exception,
but
we
believe
it
is
necessary
to
effectively
police
the
sea
border.
the
sea
border
is
nothing
but
an
imaginary
line
three
miles
from
the
coast.
now,
if
a
suspicionless
boarding
and
document
check
is
allowed
only
when
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
a
vessel
has
crossed
the
border,
that
is
an
impossible
standard.
unless
the
customs
officer
actually
observes
the
vessel
crossing
the
border,
he
will
usually
have
no
way
of
detecting
whether
a
border
crossing
has
taken
place.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
we
believe
that
any
foreign...
persons
on
any
foreign
vessel
within
united
states
waters
have
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy,
at
least
with
respect
to
their
documents.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
your
honor,
i
hesitate
to
analogize
this
too
closely
to
border
searches
on
land,
because
the
sea
is
simply
not
like
the
land.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
that's
correct,
and
with
an
airplane
you
can
usually
detect
on
radar
whether
it
has
in
fact
crossed
the
border,
and
with
scheduled
airlines,
you
know
in
advance
where
they
are
coming
from.
there
is
no
way
of
gathering
analogous
information
concerning
a
vessel.
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
suspicionless
boardings
and
inspections
are
necessary.
when
a
vessel
enters
u.s.
waters,
there
is
really
no
way
of
knowing
where
it
is
coming
from,
what
it
is
carrying,
and
whether
it
has
complied
with
any
of
the--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
if
it
was
a
foreign
vessel,
of
course,
it
would
have
foreign...
it
would
have
foreign
documents.
now,
this
was
a
vessel--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--each
country
has
its
own
documentation
system.
this
was
a
french-registered
vessel
bearing
swiss
markings.
i
don't
know
what--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--as
soon
as
it
entered
customs
waters,
it
was
required
to
report
its
arrival
promptly
to
customs,
and
if
it
was
to
go
any
further,
it
would
need
a
cruising
license,
or
else
it
would
have
to
make
entry
again--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--it
had
entered
customs
waters
and--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--we
were
looking
for
its
basic
foreign
registry
documents,
where
was
it
registered,
what
sort
of
vessel
was
it.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
correct.
the
federal
statute
authorizes
an
inspection
of
any
documents.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
think
this
may
vary
from
country
to
country.
for
federally
documented
vessels,
they
are
pieces
of
paper
that
are
usually
kept
in
the
bridge.
on
a
numbered
american
boat,
there
is
a
small
certificate
of
number
which
is
sometimes--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
is
often
if
not
usually
impractical
to
do
that
without
boarding
the
boat.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
because
boats
rock
back
and
forth
and
hit
each
other.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
he
may
do
that,
perhaps.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
he
may
do
that
perhaps,
but
part
of--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
i
don't
know
what
their
response
would
be
in
a
specific
case,
but
part
of--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
reasonable
first
to
inspect
the
documents,
and
then
after
doing
so--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
part
of
a
documentation
inspection
is
examining
the
main
beam
number,
which
necessitates
a
visit
to
a
portion
of
the
hold.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
is
required
to
make
a
satisfactory
identification
of
the
vessel.
i
believe
it
is
part
of
the
standard
procedure
in
checking
the
documentation
of
a
foreign
vessel.
otherwise,
there
is
no
reliable
way
of
knowing
what
sort
of
vessel
this
is.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
there
is
a
statute,
19
usc
1581(a),
that
authorizes
customs
officers
to
board
any
vessel
in
any
part
of
the
united
states
to
check
its
documents
and
to
examine
the
vessel.
that
would
entail
the
authority
to
examine
the
documents
and
check
the
main
beam
number.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
authorizes--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--it
is
in
a
statute,
and
in
the
regulations,
but
it
is--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--it
says,
to
search
the
vessel.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
says,
it
conveys
the
broad
power
to--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--the
statute
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
page
1-a.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
that
is
true
with
any
foreign
vessel
entering
a
port.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
i
would
suppose
that
someone
attempting
to
set
the
record
for
the
smallest
vessel
to
make
a
trans-atlantic
crossing
would
be
subject
to
those
entry
requirements.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
that
is
why
a
vessel
like
the
henry
morgan
ii
cannot
have
any
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
u.s.
waters.
on
a
vessel
like
that,
customs
is
expressly
authorized
by
statute
to
put
someone
on
board
and
leave
him
there
as
long
as
the
vessel
is
in
u.s.
waters.
now,
as
i
was
saying,
inspection
of
the
vessel's
documents
is
vitally
important
in
performing
all
of
these
important
national
functions,
and
this
is
so
because
there
is
simply
no
other
way
of
effectively
enforcing
the
documentation
laws.
the
markings
on
vessels,
as
we
have
attempted
to
show
in
the
brief,
are
simply
not
satisfactory.
they
can
be
easily
falsified.
they
are
not
very
revealing,
especially
in
the
case
of
a
foreign
vessel,
and
even
in
the
case
of
an
american
vessel,
they
do
not
disclose
very
much.
respondents
have
suggested
a
number
of
alternatives,
but
i
want
to
stress
that
none
of
these
would
be
satisfactory.
certainly
hailing
a
vessel,
as
they
suggest,
is
no
substitute
for
looking
at
the
documents,
because
it
requires
the
customs
officers
to
take
the
word
of
the
persons
on
board.
checking
the
documents
only
in
the
case
where
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
border
crossing,
as
i
have
tried
to
show,
is
also
not
acceptable,
nor
is
it
satisfactory
to
check
with
the
documentation
office
by
radio,
for
a
number
of
reasons,
including
the
fact
that
the
information
available
from
that
office
is
severely
limited.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
that's
correct,
but
what
is
at
issue--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--what
is
at
issue
here
is
the
search...
is
the
boarding
and
document
check
in
this
particular
case,
which
involved
such
a
large
sea-going
foreign
vessel.
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
address
other
applications,
but
certainly--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
am
not
asserting
that
that
authority
would
not
apply
in
those
instances,
because
customs
has
enforcement
responsibilities--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--i
think
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--yes,
they
could.
customs
has
the
responsibility
for--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--it
would...
i
believe
the
authority
would
extend
to
any
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states,
because
customs
has
the...
has
enforcement
authority
that
goes
beyond
policing
the
entry
of
goods
coming
from
abroad,
although
that
is
perhaps
their
most
highly
visible
responsibility.
they
also
have
the
duty
to
enforce
all
the
shipping
and
navigation
laws,
and
this
would
justify
boarding
many
miles
further
inland
than
the
one
in
this
case.
but
i
want
to
stress
that,
of
course,
it
is
only
the
situation
here
that
is
at
issue.
let
me
now
explain
very
briefly
why
suspicionless
boardings
and
inspections
of
vessels
entail
a
much
lesser
intrusion
upon
protected
privacy
interests
than
land
inspections
to
which
they
are
sometimes
compared.
first
of
all,
when
a
documentation
check
is
made,
a
vessel
is
detained
only
briefly,
if
at
all.
the
inspecting...
the
boarding
officer
does
not
search
the
whole
vessel.
he
only
searches
the
documents
and
makes
a
visit
to
the
hold
to
look
at
the
main
beam
number
if
that
is
appropriate
based
on
the
type
of
vessel.
he
doesn't
search
the
cargo
or
the
cabins
or
the
passenger
compartments.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
one
of...
that
is
one
of
the
bases
for
this
authority,
but--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--it
is
the
primary,
but
not
the
exclusive
basis.
as
i
was
saying--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--well,
we
are
specifically
not
making
that
argument,
but
i
think
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
that
any
rule
that
would
draw
a
distinction
between
commercial
and
non-commercial
vessels
would
be
extremely
unworkable.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
isn't
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
and
that--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--we
are
arguing
for
a
much
broader
rule,
but
in
this
case
all
that
is
involved
is
a
vessel
located,
as
i
said,
a
relatively
short
distance
from
the
coast.
we
think
that
the
necessity
for
suspicionless
boardings
and
document
checks
is
most
important
in
that
area,
but
the
statute
authorizes
boardings
and
inspections
in
other
areas,
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
to
the
extent
it
goes
further
than
what
was
necessary
here,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
right.
we
have
a
40-foot
foreign
vessel,
i
want
to
stress,
located
not
very
far
from
the
coast,
and
although
it
is
masquerading
as
a
pleasure
vessel,
in
fact,
it
is
engaged
in
a
very
lucrative,
although
illegal,
trade.
it
is
carrying
a
$7
million
cargo.
this
is
not
a
pleasure
vessel,
and
a
rule
that
tried
to
draw
a
distinction
between
pleasure
vessels
and
commercial
vessels
would
be
subject
to
just
this
sort
of
abuse.
people
engaged
in
violations
of
the
documentation
laws
would
use
the
sort
of
vessels
that
are
commonly
employed
for
recreational
purposes,
and
would
document
them
for
recreational
use.
the
invasion
of
privacy
involved
in
stopping
a
vessel
and
conducting
a
document
check
is
significantly
different
from
what
is
involved
in
conducting
a
discretionary
vehicle
stop
on
land.
first,
and
probably
most
important,
vessels
simply
do
not
play
the
same
central
role
in
the
lives
of
the
average
person
as
a
passenger
car
does.
i
suspect
that
most
of
the
people
in
court
today
used
a
passenger
car
this
morning,
and
they
will
use
one
tonight.
i
doubt
that
many
people
here
used
a
vessel
or
will
use
one
later
in
the
day.
land
vessels
have
not
historically
been
subject
to
the
same
close
regulation
as...
excuse
me.
land
vehicles
have
not
been
subject
to
the
same
close
supervision
as
vessels.
in
fact,
the
early
statutes
from
which
customs
authority
derives
specifically
required
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
for
searches
on
land.
in
sum,
the
important
interests
served
by
the
documentation
laws
in
our
judgment
far
outweigh
their
minimal
intrusion
upon
privacy
interests,
and
for
that
reason
customs'
long-standing
authority
to
conduct
suspicionless
boardings
and
inspections
should
be
sustained.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
two
very
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
if
the
court
wishes,
we
will
submit
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
issue
of
whether
dismissal
of
the
indictment
mooted
this
case.
second,
i
want
to
emphasize--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
we
will
look
into
that.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
well,
your
honor,
as
i
said,
that
was
done
not
because
they
had
no
further
interest
in
pursuing
this
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
it
was
done
because
he
wanted
to
comply
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
only
other...
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
i
am
sorry.
the
only
other
point
i
would
like
to
add,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
that
the
crux
of
this
case
is
that
until
a
documentation
inspection
is
conducted,
it
is
not
possible
to
know
what
sort
of
vessel
customs
is
dealing
with,
and
that
is
why
it's
necessary,
and
that
is
illustrated
graphically
by
this
particular
case.
here,
if
the
henry
morgan
ii
had
been
a
documented
boat
from
basilea,
louisiana,
or
mississippi,
or
alaska,
it
would
have
had
exactly
the
same
markings,
and
here,
a
customs
patrol
in
a
louisiana
ship
channel
came
across
a
boat
that
bore
the
outward
markings
of
a
landlocked
country
5,000
miles
away.
the
hailing
port
was
written
in
latin,
and
although
the
vessel
bore
swiss
markings,
it
was
actually
of
french
registry.
because
situations
like
this
come
up
all
the
time,
it
is
necessary
to
conduct
a
documentation
check
to
determine
whether
any
further
procedures,
including
a
full-scale
border
search,
is
appropriate.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
i
believe
it
is
necessary
to
do
that,
because
until
you
inspect
the
documents,
you
cannot--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--we
believe
the
statute
is
constitutional,
and
that
is
what
it
provides.
i
think
this
case
is--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
all
that
was
conducted
here
was
a
document
check.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that's
correct.
a
document
check
was
conducted
here,
and
those
are
reasonable
because
they
are
necessary
for
enforcing
many
important
national
laws.
thank
you.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
no,
it
is
in
any
part
of
the
united
states
or
in
customs
waters.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
a
search
could
be
made
100
miles
off
the
coast
by
the
coast
guard
pursuant
to
a
different
statute
which
authorizes
boardings
on
the
high
seas
of
any
vessel
subject
to
u.s.
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose--
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
--there
are
many
cases
pending
on
that
issue,
and
that
authority
has
generally
been
upheld
by
courts
of
appeals
based
upon
reasoning
analogous
to
the
arguments
we
have
advanced
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
quite
a
few.
there
have
been
a
number
of
them.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
that
authority
has
been
sustained
by
at
least
three
or
four
circuits,
and
cert
has
been
denied
on
numerous
occasions.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
we
did
in
our
petition
for
rehearing.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
we
did
not
do
it
initially
because
of
settled
fifth
circuit
authority,
and
because
we
had
won
on
alternative
grounds
in
the
district
court.
mr.
samuel
a.
alito
jr.
but
we
raised
it
in
the
petition
for
rehearing.
