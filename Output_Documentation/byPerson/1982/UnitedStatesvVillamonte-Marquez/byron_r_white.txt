justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
have
to
reinstate
the
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
sentence,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
what
your
brief
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
was
indicted,
and
he
was
convicted
while
the
indictment
was
outstanding.
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
disputes
there
was
an
indictment
at
one
time.
and
that...
and
the
only
requirement
for
indictment
is
under...
that
he
be
indicted
before
he
is
tried,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
mandate
went
back
down,
it
went
back
down
to
the
district
court,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
dismissed
the
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
whose
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
we
know
what
the
record
is,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
some
transcript
made
at
that
time
of
what
happened
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
hope
to
make
some
authority
for
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
alito,
what
particular
document
or
documents
did
this
particular
sailing
vessel
need,
even
though
it
was
from...
even
if
you
believed
it
was
from
a
foreign
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
documents?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
what
documents...
did
that
vessel
need
any
document
required
by
united
states
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
it
hadn't
entered
the
united
states
yet.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
just
asking
you
again,
at
the
point
where
the
vessel
was
boarded,
what
document
were
you
looking
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
permitted
under
the
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
documents
like
that
sort
of
mobile,
or
are
they
attached
to
a
vessel
somewhere,
or
are
they...
can
you
hand
them
around,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
this
gentleman
had
said,
yes,
he
understands
english,
and
you
want
some
documents,
i
shall
hand
you
the
document,
and
don't
board
my
boat?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
captain
boarding
your
boat?
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
the
rocking
back
and
forth?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
said
to
you,
i
will
board
your
boat
and
bring
my
documents?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
would
be
your
response
for
the
united
states
if
he
said
that
and
he
said,
stay
off
my
boat,
but
i'll
bring
you
my
document?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
and
if
they
complied,
you
wouldn't
board
his
boat,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
for
a
foreign
vessel
at
18
miles
from
the
coast?
is
that
required,
that
you
look
at
the
beam
number?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
a
statute
or
some
regulation
that
says,
please
look
at
the
beam
numbers?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
you
get
that
latter
authority,
to
check
the
beam
number?
you
don't
need--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
is
done
in
a
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
examine
the
beam
number?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
examine...
search
the
vessel
for
a
beam
number,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
then
certainly
isn't
limited
to
vessels
who
you
see
on
the
stern
may
come
from
a
foreign
port.
it
is
just
any
vessel
anchored
18
miles
from--
justice
byron
r.
white
--isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
have
to
win
based
on
having
us
accept
a
fact
like
that,
you
may
be
in
trouble.
your
real
case
is
that
whatever
the
reason,
this
boarding
was
improper.
whether
it
was
an
administrative
or
any
other
kind
of
a
boarding,
it
was
improper.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
you
really
have
to
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
we
know?
how
do
we
know
whether
it
is
the
true
nature
of
it?
we
don't
have
any
findings
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
lack
of
some
kind
of
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
that
help
you?
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
like
a
roadblock.
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
not
going
to
pick
and
choose.
we're
going
to...
everybody
in
sight
is
going
to
have
a
document
check.
justice
byron
r.
white
random?
it
isn't
random
at
all
if
you're
going
to
stop
every
vessel
you
see
in
that
lake.
nothing
random
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
like
setting
up
a
roadblock
and
saying,
everybody
who
goes
through
this
roadblock
is
going
to
have
to
show
his
registration
certificate.
justice
byron
r.
white
stopping
everybody
in
sight?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
to
show
to
win
that
the
boarding
was
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
show
that,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
show
that
the
boarding
was
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
search?
of
the
boarding.
justice
byron
r.
white
congress
has
said
that
that
doesn't...
that...
here
is
what
we
think
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
you
should
be
able
to
board
any
vessel
for
a
documentation
search.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
is
the
same
rule
whether
it
was
three
miles
from
the...
two
miles
from
the
coast,
three
miles
from
the
coast,
18
miles
from
the
coast,
or
100
miles?
a
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
close.
it
is
close.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
have
already
crossed
the
border.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
time
you
cross
the
border,
you
can
search?
you
can
not
only
board,
you
can
search
the
entire
vessel?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
within
three
miles,
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
it
wasn't
customs.
the
state,
the
state
says,
any
time
you
cross
our
border,
you
have
to
be
searched.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
a
vessel,
it
can
unload
anywhere
along
the
beach,
and
here
is
a...
here
is
the
state's
border,
three
miles
out
in
the
ocean,
or
nine
miles,
some
places
in
the
gulf,
and
the
vessel
has
crossed
the
border
of
the
state.
you
don't
know
where
it's
going
to
tie
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
go
into
some...
it
may
just
unload.
it
just
may
anchor
50
yards
off
the
coast
and
unload.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
state
could
stop
that
and
insist
on
a
search
to
see
if
it
is
carrying
something
that
is
contrary
to
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
it
isn't.
assume
for
the
minute
it
isn't.
what
is
the
border
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
border?
what
is
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that's...
you
mean
the
customs
waters
is
three
miles?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
your
submission,
it
sounds
like,
your
most
recent
one,
anyway,
is
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
boarding
was
all
right,
but
that
you
aren't
pushing
for
any
kind
of
a
rule
that
you
can
search
any...
you
can
board
any
vessel
that
you
find
anchored
18
miles
off
the
coast.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
saying
any
vessel
you
find
anchored
or
under
way
18
miles
off
the
coast
or
any
distance
off
the
coast,
for
that
matter,
you
can
stop
and
make
a
document
check?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
not
arguing
about
the
search,
i
don't
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
arguing
that
the
search
provision,
part
of
the...
is
constitutional?
