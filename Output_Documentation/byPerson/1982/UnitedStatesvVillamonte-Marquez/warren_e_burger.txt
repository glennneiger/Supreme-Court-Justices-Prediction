we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
united
states
against
villamonte-marquez.
mr.
alito,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
address
itself
to
the
indictment
or
merely
set
aside
the
judgments?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
your
position
that
if
you
were
complying
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals,
you
can't
be
charged
with
any
waiver?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wouldn't
necessarily
follow
that
there
would
be
a
new
trial,
if
the
only
evidence
the
government
had
was
the
evidence
that
was
suppressed.
the
government
routinely
dismisses
indictments,
or
just
doesn't
pursue
an
outstanding
indictment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
was
consistent
with
the...
if
not
ordered,
it
was
certainly
consistent
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals?
well,
supposing
you
had
a
civil
case
where
plaintiff
got
a
judgment
in
a
negligence
case,
and
the
appellate
court
set
it
aside
and
sent
it
back
for
a
new
trial,
and
the
plaintiff
went
in
and
moved
to
dismiss
his
complaint.
could
you
reinstate
the
judgment
after
the
complaint
was
dismissed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
let's
get
on
with
the
merits
of
the
case
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
pursue
this,
not
on
a
little
sailing
vessel
down
there,
but
a
british
or
a
swedish
or
a
norwegian
or
a
dutch
vessel
comes
into
the
new
york
harbor.
before
they
can
open
a
hatch
or
discharge
a
passenger
or
do
anything,
our
people
board
it
and
look
at
the
papers,
do
they
not,
and
they
are
permitted
by
statute
to
do
it,
and
they
can
inspect
the
ship
from
stem
to
stern
and
top
to
bottom.
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
is
a
40-foot
sailboat
or
a
300-foot
cruise
vessel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
this
includes
the
health
officers,
and
the
customs
officers,
and
a
whole
range
of
people,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
event,
we
haven't
got
a
lake
case
here
today,
have
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ieyoub.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
they
asked,
requested
to?
do
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
state
police
of
the
border
states
haven't
any
right
to
cooperate
with
federal
customs
people
and
the
fbi
and
whatnot
in
keeping
drugs
out
of
the
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
that
when
these
officers
stood
on
the
deck
of
this
craft,
they
were
there
illegally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
when
they
detected
the
odor
of
burning
marijuana,
they
could
not
legally
do
anything
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
could
they
take
the
vessel
in
tow,
and
take
them
to
a
united
states
magistrate
and
get
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
a
check
point
be
less
of
an
intrusion
on
privacy?
and
you
have
just
conceded
that
a
check
point
could
have
been
set
up
along
this
waterway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
there
be
less
intrusion
of
the
privacy
if
the
customs
boat
had
pulled
alongside
and
said,
200
yards
north
there
is
a
check
point,
pull
your
craft
in
for
inspection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
for
the
check
point,
they
could
have
the
stop
and
the
search
without
suspicion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
as
someone
pointed
out,
chicago
or
minneapolis-st.
paul
are
thousands
of
miles
away
from
the
mexican
border,
but
a
plane
from
acapulco
has
got
to
stop
and
be
boarded
and
inspected
completely
when
it
makes
its
first
landing
in
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
papers
in
fact
were
found
on
this
craft
when
they
boarded?
what
kind
of
papers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
alito?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything...
your
time
is
not
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
take
your
argument
to
be,
as
applied
here,
it
meets
constitutional
standards.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
in
mind
how
many
times
we
have
denied
certiorari
on
boardings
off
the
florida
coast
and--
--both
ways.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
both
ways.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
