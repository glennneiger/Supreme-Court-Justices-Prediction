justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
aware
of
any
cases
in
which
a
conviction
had
been
reinstated
without
the
indictment...
i
mean,
a
conviction
had
been
reinstated
without
an
indictment
being
in
the
case,
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
never
heard
of
it.
i
have
thought
about
this
quite
a
bit,
and
i
can't
think
of
an
analogy.
i
am
not
sure
it
is
moot.
i
think
maybe
you
are
right
about
mootness.
but
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
have
a
conviction
in
a
case
where
there
is
no
underlying
pleading.
i
mean,
you
couldn't
enter
a
judgment
in
a
case
if
nobody
ever
filed
a
complaint.
how
can
you
have
a
conviction
without
an
indictment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
it
ever
been
done,
to
your
knowledge,
under
this
set
of
facts?
i
am
just
puzzled
by
this
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can't
cite
us
any
case
in
which
it
has
been
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
required
was
that
you
set
aside
the
conviction
and
suppress
the
evidence,
which
normally
would
lead
to
a
new
trial.
i
don't
see
why
there
was
any
requirement
of
dismissing
the
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
have
complied
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
without
dismissing
the
indictment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
stayed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
would
have
necessitated
a
motion
for
a
stay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
don't
have
any
authority
for
that
proposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
after
the
prevailing
party
moved
to
dismiss
his
own
complaint?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
wasn't
necessary
to
comply
with
the
mandate.
it
clearly
wasn't
necessary.
if
it
sent
it
back
for
a
new
trial,
you
don't
have
to
go
in
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question?
i
know
it
has
been
asked.
i
am
a
little...
not
entirely
clear
on
your
answer.
justice
brennan,
i
believe,
asked
you,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
did
you
argue
that
reasonable
suspicion
was
not
necessary?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
