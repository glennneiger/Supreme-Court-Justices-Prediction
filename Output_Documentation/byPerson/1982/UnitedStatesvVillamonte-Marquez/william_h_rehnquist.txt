justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
border
searches
of
airplanes?
you
can
make
a
border
search
of
an
airplane
at
an
airfield
in
chicago,
can't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
government
is
right,
and
i
realize
you
argue
they
are
not,
that
suspicionless
boardings
are
permissible
under
the
statute
and
don't
violate
the
constitution,
what
difference
does
it
make
what
motive
the
investigators
had?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
have
any
finding
from
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
search
was
primarily
to
obtain
incriminating
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
i
mean,
i
asked
you,
did
either
of
the
lower
courts
make
a
finding
such
as
you
are
now
saying
apparently
should
have
been
made?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
plane
was
sited
by
customs
officials
on
the
arizona-mexican
border
as
coming
in
from
mexico,
and
they
were
able
to
trace
it
by
radar,
say,
to
simply
a
small
landing
field
in
northern
arizona,
northern
new
mexico.
do
you
think
those
customs
officials,
if
they
were
able
to
wire
their
compatriots
wherever
it
landed,
would
have
to
have
some
sort
of
a
warrant
or
reasonable
suspicion
before
inspecting
that
plane?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
accept
my
factual
hypothesis,
if
you
will.
and
it
isn't
unusual.
it
isn't
unusual
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
know
why
that
would
be,
but
supposing
the
government
didn't
argue
any
law
violation,
they
just
said,
we
can
make
a
suspicionless
inspection
in
the
nature
of
a
border
search
here,
even
though
you
are
400
miles
from
the
border.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
customs
officials
had
seen
your
client's
boat
crossing
the
three-mile
limit
or
12
miles,
whatever
it
is
in
louisiana,
they
could
have
stopped
it
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
in
fact
it
turned
out
that
the
boat
had
crossed
the
border.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
what
shows
as
lake
calcasieu
on
the
roadmap?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
what
you
call
the
calcasieu
ship
channel
what
shows
as
lake
calcasieu
on
the
roadmap,
or
is
that
further
up?
it
is--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
suppose
they
are
two...
the
ship
channel
and
the
lake
are
two
separate
things?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
that
would
be
all
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you
are
challenging
is
the
application
of
the
statute
to
your
particular
case,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
you
can't
call
up
a
bunch
of
hypotheses
that
might
occur
under
the
statute
that
didn't
happen
in
this
case
to
urge
a
court
to
conclude
that
what
happened
in
this
case
was
wrong.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
is
unreasonable
for
a
state
to
put
up
an
inspection
station
at
its
border
and
search
for
citrus
that
may
cause
plant
disease
in
that
state?
