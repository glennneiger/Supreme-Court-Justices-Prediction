chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
place.
mr.
horowitz,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
explanation
in
the
record,
or
do
you
have
one,
for
the
delay
from
friday
to
monday?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
there
magistrates
on
duty
over
the
weekend
in
the
southern
district,
if
that
is
where
this
was?
the
eastern
district.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
some
districts--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--is
it
not
true
that
in
some
districts
there
is
24-magistrate
service,
seven
days
a
week,
if
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
why,
though.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
that
they
called
the
u.s.
attorney
and
he
said,
wait
until
monday.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
all
the
record
shows.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
clark.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
stereotypes,
you
mean
applying
the
profile?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
used
the
term
stereotypes.
do
you
mean
by
that--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--oh,
i
thought
you
said
stereotypes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
speaking
of
the
person
or
of
the
bag?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
know,
as
we
hear
these
cases,
mr.
clark,
we
are
all
aware
that
we
don't
judge
the
validity
of
a
search
by
the
fruits
of
a
search.
nevertheless,
three
or
four
times
a
week
we
sit
here
and
hear
counsel
making
all
the
points
that
are
made,
and
in
every
case
the
only
reason
the
case
is
here
is
because
heroin
or
opium
or
cocaine
was
discovered.
now,
it
isn't
your
job,
of
course...
you
are
the
advocate
here.
it
isn't
your
job
to
say
how
the
government
should
do
it,
but
only
how
the
government
can't
do
it.
it
is
an
almost
intractable
problem,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
murder
cases
and
kidnapping
cases
we
don't
have
uniformly
a
search
and
seizure
problem,
and
almost
uniformly
and
invariably
we
have
that
problem
in
drug
prosecutions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
mr.
clark
have
any
time
remaining?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
horowitz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
