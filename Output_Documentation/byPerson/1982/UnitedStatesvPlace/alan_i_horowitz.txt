mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
presented
here
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
police
conduct
undertaken
to
investigate
suspicion
of
illegal
activity
as
it
arises
in
a
public
place.
specifically,
when
circumstances
arise
that
give
police
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
an
individual
is
carrying
contraband
in
his
suitcase,
is
it
reasonable
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
for
the
police
to
detain
that
suitcase
for
a
limited
time
in
order
to
conduct
a
specific
limited
course
of
investigation
to
confirm
or
dispel
their
suspicion,
in
this
case,
to
arrange
for
a
sniff
by
a
narcotics-detecting
dog?
the
court
of
appeals
held,
and
respondent
argues--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
there
is
no
contention
here
that
the
dog
sniff
itself
was
unconstitutional,
given--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
the
90-minute
period
of
time
during
which
the
respondent
was
dispossessed
of
his
luggage.
the
court
of
appeals
held,
and
respondent
argues,
that
such
conduct
is
unreasonable
unless
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
suitcase
contains
contraband,
the
same
standard
that
would
justify
arresting
the
individual.
the
facts
underlying
this
case
can
be
summarized
as
follows.
two
florida
narcotics
detectives
on
duty
at
miami
airport
observed
respondent
behaving
in
a
manner
characterized
by
the
district
court
as
"odd,
if
not
bizarre".
to
the
trained
eyes
of
the
agents,
this
behavior
seemed
designed
to
detect
surveillance,
and
created
a
suspicion
in
their
minds
that
respondent
was
a
drug
courier.
the
officers
also
noted
that
respondent
had
purchased
his
ticket
with
cash,
and
that
there
were
certain
discrepancies
in
the
information
on
his
baggage
tags.
they
approached
respondent
in
the
boarding
area,
and
had
a
brief
conversation
with
him,
but
they
terminated
that
conversation
to
allow
respondent
to
catch
his
flight
to
new
york.
the
florida
detectives,
however,
called
ahead
and
communicated
all
of
the
information
they
have
obtained
to
dea
agent
gerard
whitmore,
who
was
stationed
at
laguardia
airport.
agent
whitmore
and
his
partner
watched
respondent
as
he
alighted
from
the
flight
in
new
york.
they
also
observed
him
engaged
in
a
series
of
maneuvers
that
appeared
to
them
to
be
designed
to
detect
and
evade
surveillance,
and
that
indicated
to
these
officers
as
well
that
respondent
likely
was
a
drug
courier.
after
respondent
retrieved
his
bags
from
the
baggage
claim,
the
agents
approached
him,
identified
themselves,
and
informed
him
that
he
was
suspected
of
carrying
narcotics.
respondent
immediately
stated
that
he
had
recognized
the
agents
as
policemen,
a
remark
he
had
also
made
to
the
officers
in
florida.
when
asked
whether
the
bags
he
was
carrying
were
his,
respondent
said
that
they
were,
and
then
he
falsely
stated
that
he
had
already
been
surrounded
by
a
gang
of
agents
in
miami
who
searched
both
his
person
and
his
bags.
respondent
subsequently
refused
a
request
by
the
officers
to
consent
to
a
search
of
his
bags,
and
then
asked
them
whether
he
was
under
arrest.
agent
whitmore
informed
him
that
he
was
free
to
leave,
but
that
his
luggage
would
be
kept
and
taken
to
a
judge
to
determine
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant.
the
agents
explained
to
respondent
that
they
would
not
open
the
luggage
without
a
warrant,
and
that
they
would
return
it
to
him
if
no
warrant
was
issued.
some
further
conversation
ensued,
in
which
respondent
retracted
his
earlier
admission
of
ownership
of
one
of
the
bags,
and
asked
the
officers
whether
some
arrangement
could
be
made
or
whether
something
could
be
fixed
up
so
that
he
could
still
leave
the
airport
with
his
bags.
ultimately,
respondent
stated
that
he
had
pressing
engagements
and
did
not
wish
to
remain
with
his
luggage,
and
the
agents
gave
him
a
number
for
him
to
contact
them
to
arrange
for
the
return
of
his
luggage.
the
agents
then
took
the
luggage
to
the
customs
mail
handling
facility
at
kennedy
airport
to
arrange
for
exposure
to
a
drug-detecting
dog.
approximately
90
minutes
after
the
luggage
was
taken
from
respondent,
the
dog
reacted
positively
to
one
suitcase.
after
a
search
warrant
was
obtained,
the
suitcase
was
opened,
and
substantial
quantities
of
cocaine,
marijuana,
and
lsd
were
found.
the
district
court
denied
a
motion
to
suppress,
finding
that
agent
whitmore
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
respondent's
suitcase
contained
contraband,
and
that
this
suspicion
justified
the
temporary
detention
of
the
luggage
to
arrange
for
the
dog
sniff.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
majority
accepted
the
district
court's
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion,
but
held
that
the
detention
of
a
suitcase
based
on
such
suspicion
could
last
no
longer
than
could
a
temporary
detention
of
a
person,
and
hence
the
90-minute
detention
here
was
unconstitutional
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
was
90
minutes
from
the
time
they
took
the
bag--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
afterwards,
i
imagine
they
got
a
warrant--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
imagine
they
held
the
bag
until
the
suppression
hearing.
once
they
had
probable
cause,
they
held
it
until
they
could
get
a
warrant,
and
then
they
got
a
warrant
and
opened
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
over
the
weekend,
then...
and
beyond
that,
i
would
think.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
before
they
got
the
warrant,
yes,
they
held
it
over
the
weekend.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
in
the
record.
also,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggests
that
respondent
ever
called
them
to
find
out
about
getting
his
bag
back,
so
there
was
nothing
they
could
have
done
with
it
anyway.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
can't
know
in
this
case,
because
respondent
never...
in
the
course
of
his
conversation
with
them
at
the
airport,
he
didn't
seem
very
concerned
about
getting
his
bag
back.
he
never
gave
them
his
address
where
he
was
going
to
be
or
told
them
anything
about
how
to
return
it
to
them.
the
only
thing
that
was
left
was
that
respondent
was
going
to
call
them
to
arrange
to
get
it
back.
so,
as
i
said
to
justice
marshall,
i'm
not
sure
how
they
could
have
returned
it
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
practice
is
to
give
it
back
to
them
as
expeditiously
as
possible.
if
they
knew
where
respondent
was,
they
would
just
have
it
delivered
to
where
he
was.
if
he
lived
ten
minutes
from
laguardia
airport,
it
would
be
another
ten
minutes
after--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
they
didn't
know
where
he
was.
he
didn't
tell
them.
i
am
sure
since
he
knew
there
was
cocaine
in
the
suitcase,
his
idea
was
to
get
as
far
away
as
possible.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
eventually
they
arrested
him,
yes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there
is
not
a
published
policy
on
this.
the
dea
informs
me
that
as
a
general
rule,
they
do
deliver
the
luggage
directly
to
the
people,
and
it
might
well
be
unreasonable
for
them
not
to.
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
record
says
they
told
him
that
they
would
return
it
to
him.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
suggested
they
wouldn't
have
done
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
first
of
all,
if
the
person
is
concerned
about
getting
his
baggage
back
immediately,
an
innocent
person,
for
example,
might
well
have
gone
with
them
and
would
have
gotten
it
back
immediately
after
the
90
minutes,
even--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--wasn't
he
innocent?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
he
hadn't
been
convicted
yet
but
he
did
have
cocaine
in
his
suitcase.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
that
is
not
the
only
way
he
can
do
it.
that
is
the
most
expeditious
way
he
can
do
it.
he
has
a
choice,
though.
it
is
not
like
a
terry
stop.
the
point
of
a
terry
stop
is
that
he
is
not
free
to
leave.
here
he
is
free
to
leave.
he
is
also
free
to
go
with
his
suitcase
if
he
is
concerned
about
it.
the
other
thing
is,
a
person
who
doesn't
want
to
go
with
his
suitcase
but
still
is
interested
in
getting
it
back
as
quickly
as
possible
would
ask...
it
would
obviously
occur
to
him
to
ask
the
agents
how
he
is
going
to
get
it
back,
and
to
give
them
information
that
would
enable
them
to
return
it
to
him
as
quickly
as
possible.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
they
had
dogs
stationed
on
a
permanent
basis
at
laguardia?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
it
is
hard
to
know.
presumably,
there
wouldn't...
i
guess
the
35
minutes
involved
in
driving
to
kennedy
would
not
have
been
needed.
it
is
possible
the
dog
would
be
busy
at
another
part
of
the
airport.
there
is
still...
i
think,
justice
rehnquist,
that
even
if
there
were
dogs
at
laguardia,
i
would
have
to
say
that
there
might
be
a
detention
necessary
to
some
extent.
they
can't
always
have
the
dog
and
the
handler
right
at
the
gate
where
the
airplane
arrives.
i
think
the
martell
case
from
the
ninth
circuit,
with
this
court's
holding
involving
the
same
issue,
is
a
case
where
the
dog
was
at
the
same
airport,
but
there
were
still...
and
in
fact
the
dog
was
called
even
before
the
suspects
were
approached,
but
there
was
still
some
delay
involved
in
actually
arranging
the
sniff.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
the
question
is
whether
the
delay
here
was
reasonable--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
in
theory
if
the
court
approves
of
detention
on
a
reasonable
suspicion,
that
there
would
be
cases
where--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
true,
but
i
think
you
also
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
an
inconvenience
for
the
agents
themselves,
and
that
they
are
not
going
to
want
to
go
through
this--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
think
they
will
want
to
do
it
only
in
cases
where
they
have
a
really
strong
suspicion.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
what
is
a
strong
suspicion
to--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
there
are
cases
where
the
agents
in
their
own
mind,
based
on
their
experience,
may
have
a
75
to
80
percent
probability,
but
they
know
that
they
have
not
met
the
objective
standard
of
probable
cause
for
going
to
a
magistrate.
i
think
it
has
to
be
recognized
there
are
going
to
be
cases
like
that,
where
to
some
extent
the...
part
of...
where
they
can
show
a
reasonable
suspicion--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
true.
well,
i
mean,
i
have
to
agree
that
there
are
going
to
be
cases...
i
mean,
that
is
true
even
when
you
get
a
warrant
on
probable
cause.
there
are
going
to
be
cases
where
it
turns
out
that
the
search
should
not
have
been
done.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
exactly,
but
the
intrusion
that
is
involved
in
those
cases
is
much
greater,
and
therefore
here
the
probability
should
be
lowered.
that
only
makes
sense.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
as
i
understand
it,
the
agents--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
agents
were
informed
by
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
that
no
magistrate
was
available
at
that
time
until
monday.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
now,
what
they
would
have
done
if
place
had
called
and
sought
to
get
his
luggage
back
at
that
point,
i'm
not
sure,
but
at
least
in
this
case,
since
there
wasn't
anything
else
they
could
do
with
the
luggage
anyway,
it
didn't
seem
unreasonable
to
wait
until
monday.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
know
for
sure.
i
know
that
magistrates
are
supposed
to
be
on
duty
other
than
from
9:00
to
5:00
during
the
week,
but
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
reluctance,
that
there
is
some
scale
as
to
when
they
should
be
bothered
at
those
times.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that's
correct.
i
should
say
that
at
this
time,
they
had
probable
cause,
though.
i
mean,
at
that
point,
we
are
not
dealing
any
more
with
the
detention
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion,
but
a
detention
on
probable
cause,
which
is
set
forth
in
chadwick,
that
they
are
entitled
to
detain
the
luggage
until
they
can
get
a
warrant.
the
constitutional
provision
involved
here
protects
individuals
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
now,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
probable
cause
standard
which
is
required
for
the
issuance
of
warrants
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
every
search
and
seizure.
reasonableness
does
not
necessarily
equal
probable
cause.
i
think
the
basic
principles
in
this
area
are
fairly
well
settled.
we
know
that
a
permanent
seizure
or
the
arrest
of
a
person
can
be
conducted
only
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause.
similarly,
the
permanent
seizure
of
effects
is
generally
justified
by
probable
cause.
on
the
other
hand,
terry
and
its
progeny
recognize
that
a
temporary
investigative
detention
of
a
person
can
be
conducted
on
less
than
probable
cause,
on
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity.
by
the
same
token,
as
is
demonstrated
by
van
leeuwen,
a
temporary
detention
of
effects
can
also
be
based
on
a
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
that's
really
the
justification
for
the
investigative
stop
in
cases
like
terry,
brignoni-ponce,
and
michigan
against
summers.
that
was
the
justification
for
the
frisk
in
terry,
for
the
search,
but
of
course
the
officer
in
terry
was
not
in
any
danger
until
he
actually
approached
the
subject.
he
could
have
turned
around
and
walked
around
the
block.
what
was
the
justification
for
the
approach
in
these
cases,
and
is,
i
think,
well
set
forth
by
the
court
in
adams
against
williams,
is
that
an
officer,
when
he
has
a
strong
suspicion
that
a
crime
was
about
to
be
committed,
is
not
supposed
to
just
turn
his
back
and
walk
away
and
sit
idly
by
while
it
happens.
michigan
against
summers
and
dunaway
against
new
york,
however,
state
that
there
are
time
limits
on
the
detention
of
a
person
that
can
be
based
on
reasonable
suspicion.
at
some
point,
when
that
temporary
detention
becomes
close
to
the
intrusiveness
of
an
arrest,
it
must
be
justified
by
probable
cause.
now,
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
exact
same
standard
that
applies
to
when
a
temporary
detention
of
a
person
becomes
overextended,
does
that
also
apply
to
the
temporary
detention
of
effects,
even
though
the
intrusion
onto
a
person's
liberty
is
obviously
much
less?
we
submit
that
there
cannot
be
this
equality,
and
that
it
must
be
that
a
detention
of
effects
can
be
extended
for
a
longer
period
of
time,
for
example,
the
90
minutes
involved
in
this
case.
the
court
has
on
many
occasions
stated
the
basis
on
which
the
reasonableness
of
a
police
action
is
to
be
determined.
it
is
judged
by
balancing
the
intrusion
on
the
individual's
fourth
amendment
interests
against
its
promotion
of
legitimate
government
concerns.
now,
in
making
that
balancing
here,
i
think
the
strong
government
concerns
involved
are
clear.
the
government
has
a
vital
interest
in
alleviating
the
narcotics
problem
in
this
country,
and
in
detecting
and
apprehending
drug
offenders.
when
officers
reasonably
suspect
an
individual
of
transporting
narcotics
through
an
airport,
they
obviously
have
a
strong
interest
in
preventing
him
from
escaping
and
placing
those
drugs
irretrievably
into
the
chain
of
distribution.
that
interest
is
much
stronger
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
they
know
that
if
they
can
preserve
the
status
quo
for
a
short
time,
they
can
either
confirm
that
suspicion
or
it
will
be
dispelled.
thus,
under
the
rule
established
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
officers
in
this
case
were
placed
in
the
position
of
allowing
a
person
they
strongly
suspected
of
carrying
drugs
to
escape
from
right
under
their
noses,
while
they
are
left
with
the
knowledge
that
if
they
had
just
had
a
little
bit
more
time
to
investigate,
they
could
have
developed
probable
cause,
arrested
him,
and
seized
the
drugs.
now,
weighed
against
this
strong
government
interest
is
what
we
feel
is
a
fairly
limited
intrusion
caused
by
the
temporary
detention
involved
here,
and
that
is
simply
the
dispossession
of
respondent's
luggage
for
the
time
required
to
complete
the
dog
sniff.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
that
it
has
never
been
contended
that
this
is
no
intrusion
at
all.
it
is
an
interference
with
the
respondent's
possessory
interest
in
his
suitcase
for
a
limited
period
of
time,
and
it
is
a
seizure
that
is
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment.
what
is
contended
here
is
that
this
intrusion
is
sufficiently
small
that
it
is
justified
by
reasonable
suspicion
of
criminal
activity,
and
does
not
require
the
strictest
standard
of
probable
cause.
now,
to
illuminate
this
point,
it
is
useful
examine
the
detention
here
in
light
of
the
intrusive
aspects
associated
with
other
police
actions
that
normally
require
probable
cause.
the
biggest
category
of
these,
of
course,
is
investigative
searches,
which
usually
can
be
conducted
only
on
probable
cause.
those,
of
course,
involve
an
invasion
of
privacy,
which
the
court
has
many
times
recognized
as
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment
protection.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
search
until
a
warrant
based
on
probable
cause
was
obtained.
there
was
no
invasion
of
privacy
whatsoever.
the
principle
that
the
core
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
privacy
finds
its
expression
in
many
areas
of
fourth
amendment
law.
for
example,
in
the
warrant
area,
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
protections
of
a
warrant
are
much
more
necessary
in
the
area
of
searches
than
they
are
in
seizures.
warrantless
seizures
from
public
places
are
generally
recognized
as
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment,
as
are
warrantless
arrests.
similarly,
in
chadwick,
a
case
where
this
court
held
that
the
police
were
not
allowed
to
search
a
footlocker
in
that
case
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
until
they
had
obtained
a
warrant,
the
court
also
stated
that
it
was
clear
that
they
were
entitled
to
detain
that
footlocker
without
a
warrant
while
they
were
seeking
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
and
also,
in
the
immigration
area,
the
court
has
recognized
that
roving
border
patrols
are
empowered
to
effect
seizures
of
cars
suspected
of
carrying
aliens
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion,
but
they
are
not
empowered
to
search
those
cars
without
probable
cause.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
would
say
yes.
the
short
answer
is
yes.
i
think
the
police
are
still
entitled,
that
there
is
still
a
much
lesser
intrusion
involved
in
the
seizure
of
something
like
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
as
we
said
in
our
brief,
we
think
it
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
police
to
keep
all
of
that
material.
i
mean,
there
is
no
reason
why
they
can't
allow
persons
to
take
keys
and
their
wallet
or
something
like
that
out
of
a
pocketbook.
in
this
case,
of
course,
you
don't
really
have
anything
like
that,
because
the
luggage
was
checked.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
they
may
not
allow
private
access
in
the
sense
of
a
person
going
behind
a
locked
door
and
taking
whatever
he
wants
out
and
disappearing,
but
certainly
a
person
could
open
the
suitcase,
say,
somewhere
within
the
view
of
the
officers,
but
in
a
way
that
doesn't
expose
the
other
contents
of
the
suitcase.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
let
me
just
say,
if
you
had
a
briefcase
sitting
on
the
desk,
and
you
opened
it
with
the
top
towards
me
so
that
i
couldn't
see
what
was
in
there,
and
took
a
couple
things
out
and
then
closed
it
again,
i
think
the
officers
would
be
entitled
to
see
what
you
had
taken
out
of
the
briefcase,
but
i
don't
see
why
they
would
see
what
is
in
there.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
things
that
a
person--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
we
do
want
to
watch
what
is
taken
out.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
agree,
but
i
don't
consider
that
a
search
of
the
suitcase.
if
the
person
says
he
needs
his
car
keys
out
of
there,
and
he
is
asked
to
show
his
keys,
i
just
don't
think
that
many
persons
would
consider
that
much
of
an
intrusion
on
their
personal
rights
to
have
to
show
their
car
keys
to
agents.
i
think
most
people
would
recognize
that
that
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
thing
for
the
agents
to
do
in
these
circumstances,
once
they
were
going
to
detain
the
suitcase.
this
case
similarly
involves
no
detention
of
the
person.
dunaway
and
summers
say
that
even
a
temporary
detention
can
require
probable
cause
if
it
rises
to
a
level
of
intrusiveness
close
to
that
associated
with
an
arrest.
this
case
is
clearly
nothing
like
an
arrest
at
all,
since
the
person
is
not
detained.
finally--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
you
would
have
to
have
some
reason
to
suspect
that
there
were...
in
the
wallet.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
i
understand
you
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
are
contained
somewhere
in
the
briefcase,
but
i
think
it
would
be
an
impossible--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--including
possibly
in
the
wallet,
but
i
think
you
might
need
somewhat
more
focused
suspicion
if
he
was
going
to
ask
for
a
search
of
the
wallet.
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
look
at
the
wallet
certainly
from
the
outside,
which
might
give
him
some
indication
of
whether
there
was
something
else
concealed
in
there.
again,
the
kind
of
suspicion
that
arises
in
this
case
doesn't
usually
focus
on
wallets
and
briefcases.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
the
officer
would
be
entitled
to
say
that
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
leave
with
the
paper
bag
unless
you
let
me
see
to
some
extent
what
is
in
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
first
of
all,
i
mean,
we
are
talking
aut
the
general
rule
here.
all
of
these
questions,
i
think,
are
directed
at
some
exceptional
case
where
the
person
says
he
has
some
private
matter,
and
in
this
case,
these
suitcases
that
were
actually
checked
with
the
airline.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
certainly
don't
think
that
people
put
the
things
that
they
can't
do
without
for
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
luggage
that
they
check
with
the
airlines.
if
they
do,
they
are
making
a
big
mistake,
because
they
are
likely,
without
any
intervention
from
dea
agents,
to
find
that
their
luggage
has
not
arrived.
the
case
of
hand
luggage
is
a
little
different.
i
think
in
that
case
it
is
much
more
credible
if
a
person
claims
that
he
has
something
that
he
has
to
be
able
to
take
out,
but
i
do
think
the
agents...
it
is
only
reasonable
to
allow
the
agents
to
take
some
precautions
when
they
allow
the
person
to
remove
it.
perhaps
i
should
just
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
a
view
brief
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
court
has
to
consider
the
implications
of
respondent's
argument
that
this
detention
here
can
be
effected
only
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause,
keeping
in
mind
justice
stevens'
comment
that
we
are
dealing
with
probabilities
here.
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause,
even
sometimes
probable
cause
only
in
the
judgment
of
an
officer,
and
not
approved
by
a
magistrate,
police
are
entitled
to
search
a
person's
effects.
they
are
entitled
to
search
his
home.
they
are
entitled
to
arrest
him.
they
are
entitled
to
imprison
him,
even
though
in
some
of
those
cases,
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
probable
cause
standard,
we
know
that
the
suspicion
is
going
to
turn
out
to
be
wrong.
here,
the
intrusion
is
so
much
less
that
it
must
be
reasonable
to
allow
the
intrusion
on
the
lesser
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion,
even
though
in
some
cases
this
may
permit
a
baggage
detention
where
the
person
turns
out
not
to
have
contraband
in
his
suitcase.
i
think
to
graphically
illustrate
the
sort
of
reasonable
suspicion
standard
that
we
are
talking
about,
you
might
consider
a
case
where
the
police
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
some
of,
say,
a
group
of
ten
people
have
contraband
in
their
suitcases,
and
they
know
that
three
or
four
of
them
have
heroin
in
their
suitcase,
but
the
other
six
or
seven
do
not.
is
it
really
reasonable
for
the
police
to
allow
all
ten
of
them
to
walk
out
of
the
airport,
knowing
that
they
are
allowing
40
pounds
of
heroin
to
go,
or
should
they
be
able
to
detain
all
ten
suitcases
for
the
hour
and
a
half
necessary
to
bring
a
dog
over
to
sniff
them?
i
would
also
say
that
it
may
be
that
in
some
of
these
cases,
there
is
going
to
be
some
slight
incremental
intrusion
that
does
not
occur
in
the
general
case
just
because
of
the
detention,
the
cases
that
justice
o'connor
and
justice
stevens
were
talking
about,
where
perhaps
a
person
has
to
take
some
personal
effects
out
of
his
suitcase
that
he
needs
immediately.
i
should
say
first
that
this
is
the
typical
case,
the
one
we
have
here,
and
none
of
these
lower
court
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs...
there
have
been
many
cases
like
this
already.
they
all
involve
luggage,
and
none
of
them
involve
cases
where
personal
effects
had
to
be
taken
out,
but
even
in
those
unusual
cases,
i
still
think
the
detention
is
reasonable.
the
additional
intrusion
of
having
to
show
your
keys
or
something
like
that
to
the
officer
is
really
quite
incremental,
especially
in
the
airport
context,
where
things
like
carry-on
luggage
and
purses
have
been
already
subjected
to
a
search
through
an
ex-ray
machine
before
you
could
get
on
the
plane.
in
an
unusual
case
where
there
is
a
drastic
inconvenience
to
the
person
involved
in
a
luggage
detention,
that
might
be
different,
and
the
court
could
consider
that
case
when
it
comes
up.
i
would
also
like
to
make
a
couple
of
factual
points.
there
was
some
discussion
about
why
one
of
the
bags
wasn't
returned
over
the
weekend.
in
fact,
the
agents
applied
for
a
search
warrant
for
both
bags,
so
it
was
certainly
necessary
for
them
to
keep
them
both
during
that
time.
as
far
as
why
they
didn't
apply
for
a
warrant
before
the
weekend,
we
don't
necessarily
say
that
that
was
correct.
they
probably
should
have
applied
for
it
over
the
weekend.
but
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
issue
presented
in
this
case,
which
is
just
the
legality
of
the
detention
for
the
period
required
to
establish
probable
cause.
it
might
be,
if
for
some
reason
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
was
somehow
a
fruit
of
the
additional
detention
that
took
place
over
the
weekend,
that
that
would
be
a
different
question.
but
it
is
not
presented
here.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
ordinarily
the
court
is
entitled
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
on
other
grounds.
briefly,
it
wouldn't
do
that
in
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
itself
didn't
reach
that.
i
think
it
is
open
on
remand.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
court
denied
the
cross-petition
in
this
case
certainly
suggests
to
the
parties
that
it
wasn't
going
to
consider
that
issue
here.
it
is
still
open
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
if
there
was
not
reasonable
suspicion,
then
they
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
detain
the
luggage.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
mean,
we
concede
that
they
had
to
have--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
right.
no,
i
agree.
the
warrant
would
probably
be
a
fruit.
