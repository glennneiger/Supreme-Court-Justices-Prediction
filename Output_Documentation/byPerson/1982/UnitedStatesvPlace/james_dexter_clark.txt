mr.
james
dexter
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
had
not
planned
to
address
myself
to
specific
factual
issues
or
discussions.
however,
in
light
of
some
of
the
questions
from
the
court,
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
resolution
of
some
of
the
facts
that
have
been
raised
by
the
members
of
the
court.
for
example,
i
think
it
was
pointed
out
that
at
miami,
when
mr.
place
was
initially
detained
by
the
public
safety
officers
there,
he
was
detained
and
certain
information
was
acquired
under
the
so-called
drug
courier
profile.
what
was
omitted
was
the
fact
that
in
light
of
the
investigation
conducted
by
these
officers,
their
suspicions
were
quelled.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
ballard
from
the
fifth
circuit,
where
the
drug
courier
profile
was
conveniently
itemized,
one
of
the
things
that
these
officers
look
for
is
whether
or
not
the
ticket
is
issued
in
the
same
name
as
the
identification
that
is
produced
by
the
detainee.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
name
coincided
without
exception.
also,
in
the
ballard
case
it
is
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
facts
that
they
look
for
is
whether
or
not
the
luggage
is
hand-carried
luggage,
and
whether
or
not
he
is
only
carrying
one
bag.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
reason
they
called
ahead
to
laguardia
was,
in
the
words
of
judge
platt,
the
presiding
district
court
judge,
in
his
opinion,
was
why
mr.
place
made
a
mistake.
as
he
was
leaving
to
go
and
board
the
plane,
he
turned
to
the
officers
and
addressed
them
and
said,
i
knew
that
you
were
police,
that
you
were
law
enforcement
authorities
all
the
time.
based
on
that,
detective
mcgavock,
who
was
the
primary
investigating
officer,
became
suspicious,
and
ran
down
and
retrieved
information
from
the
name
tags
on
the
two
suitcases.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that's
correct.
but
for
that
particular
comment,
the
officers
did
say
on
the
record
that
their
suspicions
were
quelled,
and
that
is
why
they
did
not
further
detain
him,
but
actually
allowed
him
to
plane.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
a
specific
reading
of
the
record
will
determine
that
the
information
that
was
relayed
by
detective
mcgavock
to
agent
whitmore
in
new
york
made
no
mention
of
this
supposed
disparity.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
pointed
out
in
the
record--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--the
disparity
existed
in
the
fact
that
there
was
a
strikeover
in
the
numerical
sequence
of
the
numbers.
the
addresses
were
1885
south
ocean
boulevard,
1865
south
ocean
boulevard,
which
apparently
had
some
degree
of
raising
detective
mcgavock's
suspicions.
that
fact
was
not
relayed
to
gerry
whitmore
in
new
york.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that's
correct.
we
do
not
dispute
that
they
called
ahead
and
alerted
dea
to
mr.
place's
imminent
arrival
on
the
airline
flight.
the
other
thing
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
that
although
the
officers
had
the
two
suitcases
subjected
to
a
dog
sniff
approximately
90
minutes
after
the
bags
were
seized,
they
achieved
a
result
of
positive
on
one
bag
and
nothing
on
the
other
bag,
and
they
took
no
steps
during
the
weekend
to
contact
mr.
place
so
he
could
get
back
the
bag
that
was
not
the
subject
of
the
search
warrant.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
they
had
his
address.
they
had
discovered
it
through
their
own
investigation.
they
also
had
his
telephone
number.
they
also
had
his
credentials
as
being
verified
by
his
driver's
license,
and
his
ticket
coincided.
it
was
certainly
not
incumbent,
at
least
at
this
point,
on
mr.
place
to
seek
out
his
bags.
we
have
already
been
pointed
out
that
at
least
50
percent
or
more
of
these
cases
are
not
going
to
turn
out
to
be
subjects
of
investigation,
and
yet
there
are
no
steps,
at
least
known
to
the
government
at
this
point,
as
to
how
the
dea
plans
to
get
these
bags
back
into
people's
hands.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
certainly
not.
but
it
just
goes
to
show
that
the
government's
position
that
a
detention
of
bags,
and
i
might
add,
so
far,
it
has
been
approaching
three
years
since
the
bag
has
been
detained,
both
bags,
that
is,
that
such
a
detention
is
not
one
that
is
involving
fourth
amendment
rights.
they
seem
to
say
that
personalty,
items
of
personalty
should
be
adjudged
by
some
lesser
standard.
and
with
that,
i
would
like
to
turn
from
the
discussion
of
the
facts
and
go
to
what
we
feel
is
the
thrust
of
our
legal
argument,
and
it
is
basically
a
two-pronged
argument.
first,
we
ask
that
this
court
not
expand
the
so-called
terry
exception
to
the
probable
cause
warrant
requirement,
and
second--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
so-called
terry
exception.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
the
so-called
terry
exception.
we
ask
that
this
court
not
expand
that
exception
to
include
these
detentions
that
are
actually
seizures
of
items
of
personalty,
and
we
would
also
ask
the
court
to
reject
the
proposal
of
the
government
in
judging
these
types
of
seizures
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
u.s.
constitution.
the
respondent
rejects--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--those
are
my
two
major
arguments.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
your
honor,
we
concede
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
to
approach
mr.
place.
we
attempted
to
raise--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--well,
quite
frankly,
we
argued
this
at
the
second
circuit,
and
cross-petitioned
to
this
court,
and
we
did
take
the
position
that
the
suspicions
that
were
raised
by
the
drug
courier
profile
were
not
sufficient
to
warrant
the
initial
approach.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
it
was
denied,
your
honor.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
reasonable
suspicion
existed.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
perhaps.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
correct.
perhaps
they
felt
that
the
case
could
also
be
reversed
on
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
principles
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
of
the
bags,
and
did
not
want
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
drug
courier
profile
search,
which
they
have
reached
on
numerous
occasions
due
to
the
proximity
of
laguardia
airport,
being
located
in
the
second
circuit.
the
other
thing
that
we
would
like
to
point
out
is,
we
reject
the
government's
position
that
seizures
of
suitcases
are
less
intrusive
than
seizures
of
people,
and
i
believe
justice
o'connor
and
justice
stevens
have
already
raised
the
question
as
to
what
is
a
person
going
to
do,
and
the
question
also
about
the
facts
of
the
wallet
and
whether
there
might
be
some
glassine
item
in
it.
i
would
like
to
address
that
particular
issue
that
as
to
police
conduct,
i
thin
we
have
some
insight
into
how
law
enforcement
authorities
are
going
to
act
in
situations
where
a
person
is,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
going
to
have
to
go
into
their
briefcase
to
retrieve
their
automobile
keys.
it
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
in
miami,
detective
mcgavock,
while
watching
mr.
place
open
a
hand-held
bag
that
he
had
with
him,
positioned
himself
so
that
he
could
view
the
contents
of
that
bag.
i
think
that
it
is
not
a
supportable
position
to
think
that
law
enforcement
authorities
are
going
to
allow
persons
who
are
being
detained
under
the
suspicion
that
they
are
carrying
narcotics
to
go
into
their
bags
to
retrieve
keys
or
other
items
that
they
need
at
that
very
moment.
as
far
as
the
proposition
that
seizures
of
items
of
personalty
are
less
intrusive
than
seizures
of
persons,
that
cannot
stand.
first
of
all,
in
order
to
detain,
a
term
which
i
use
because
i
have
been
more
or
less
led
into
it
by
the
government...
detain,
detain,
detain...
i
prefer
the
term
seize.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
of
the
bag.
the
reason
you
have
to
seize
a
bag,
and
you
cannot
detain
it,
and
the
reason
why
it
is
much
more
constitutionally
offensive,
is
that
you
cannot
detain
a
bag
without
also
detaining
the
owner
of
the
bag.
the
entire
premise
behind
terry
was
to
allow
a
brief
detention
and
investigatory
questions
by
law
enforcement
authorities
to
determine
the
identity
of
the
suspect
and
to
ask
that
suspect
to
explain
his
presence
in
a
particular
area,
to
dispel
the
suspicions
that
the
officers
might
have.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
pardon
me?
mr.
james
dexter
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
he
certainly
went
his
way,
but
the
point
is
that
the
detention
of
the
bag
is
even
more
intrusive
because
his
bag
did
not
go
its
way,
and
it
is
only
through
the
questioning
of
mr.
place
or
someone
in
his
position
that
suspicions
can
be
quelled
as
to
a
bag.
therefore,
you
have
to
detain
both.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
my
position
would
be
that,
first
of
all,
if
they
had
insisted
on
that,
they
would
have
arrested
mr.
place
as
well
as
the
bag,
and
they
admitted...
the
officers
even
admitted
to
mr.
place
that
they
did
not
have
even
a
reasonable
enough
suspicion
to
hold
him.
they
did
feel
that
they
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
hold
the
bags.
i
do
not
think
that
they
would
be
in
a
better
position.
the
only
position
that
i
can
offer
the
government
to
place
them
in
a
better
situation
in
this
case
would
have
been
to
have
had
a
dog
with
them
at
the
time
the
bags
and
mr.
place
were
seized.
and
the
only
way
i
can
justify
that
is
not
because
the
detention
becomes
less
offensive,
but
because
if
the
dog
had
been
present,
the
dog
could
have
smelled
the
bags
at
that
time
and
made
the
determination.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
some
reasonable
detention
of
the
bag?
mr.
james
dexter
clark
your
honor--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--i
can
read
van
leeuwen
and
conclude
otherwise
on
several
significant
points.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
significant
points
are
that
first,
in
van
leeuwen,
the
owner
of
the
two
parcels,
the
defendant,
voluntarily
relinquished
those
bags
into
the
u.s.
mail.
these
two
suitcases
were
seized
from
the
immediate
possession
and
control
of
mr.
place.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
way
i
understand
van
leeuwen,
they
said
that
at
some
point
in
time,
even
a
seizure
such
as
the
one
in
this
case
will
become
unreasonable,
but
the
reason
that
such
a
seizure
in
the
van
leeuwen
case
was
not
considered
unreasonable
was
because
the
defendant
had
voluntarily
relinquished
the
bags,
and
for
the
period
of
time
that
they
were
detained,
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
probably
not
even
aware
that
a
seizure
was
occurring,
because
until
the
addressee
in
van
leeuwen
became
aware
that
the
parcels
had
not
arrived,
and
contacted
mr.
van
leeuwen,
he
probably
was
going
about
his
merry
way,
and
his
mobility
was
not
restrained,
as
it
certainly
was
in
this
instance.
also,
in
van
leeuwen,
the
probable
cause,
the
factual
determination
of
the
facts
that
eventually
led
to
probable
cause
for
the
search
of
the
two
parcels,
was
obtained
through
independent
sources.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
the
case
seems
to
suggest
that,
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
case,
by
language
utilized
in
the
case
itself,
limited
the
holding
of
that
case
to
the
facts
as
presented
by
that
case.
we
are
here
today
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
take
the
position
that
indeed
bags,
items
of
personalty,
can
be
detained
on
less
than
probable
cause.
we
would
suggest
that
they
not
be,
because
of
the
fact
that
such
detentions,
if
you
want
to
call
them
detentions,
are
more
intrusive
than
detentions
of
personalty.
another
reason
that
we
say
that
such
a
detention
is
more
intrusive
is
that
an
item
of
personalty
by
its
very
nature,
you
either
have
it
or
you
don't.
there
is
no
sliding
scale
of
investigation
that
can
eventually
allow
this
bag
to
leave
the
presence
of
the
officers
until
they
want
it
to
leave
the
presence
of
the
officers.
you
are
either
possessed
of
the
bag
or
you
are
dispossessed.
in
a
terry
situation
involving
a
human
being
that
can
verbalize
and
talk
and
quell
suspicions,
then
obviously
the
detention
is
allowable.
but
a
bag
should
be
treated
differently.
we
would
also
suggest
that
in
this
same
vein,
the
suitcases
were,
if
you
will,
arrested,
were
arrested,
and
that
we
all
know
that
when
you
arrest
something,
a
person,
probable
cause
is
required.
the
police,
the
drug
enforcement
agents
had
custody
and
control
over
these
bags.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
cross
examination,
detective
whitmore,
when
i
posed
to
him
the
question,
"detective
whitmore,
when
you
seized
these
bags.
"
and
when
he
responded
with
the
answer,
he
said,
"you
mean,
when
we
took
the
bags.
"
and
i
asked
him
if
he
had
a
problem
with
me
using
the
word
"seize".
and
he
said,
"yes,
i
have
a
problem
with
you
using
the
word
"seize",
because
to
me
that
means
that
we
had
taken
custody
and
control
of
these
bags.
"
i
said,
"well,
when
you
took
these
bags,
you
had
custody
and
control
of
them,
didn't
you?
"
he
said,
"yes".
and
i
said,
"when
you
took
these
bags,
you
didn't
give
mr.
place
any
choice
as
to
whether
you
were
going
to
take
them
or
not,
did
you?
"
and
he
said,
"no".
"well,
then,
you
seized
them,
didn't
you?
"
and
he
said,
"yes".
so,
the
bags
were
seized.
they
were
arrested.
probable
cause
is
required.
the
suitcases
were
immobilized.
the
suitcases
became
the
focal
point
of
the
investigation.
the
suitcases
were
moved
from
one
location
to
another.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
your
honor,
i
believe...
i
was
going
to
reserve
for
my
closing
statement
a
request
that
prior
to
reaching
a
decision
in
this
case,
that
the
members
of
this
court
review
the
opinion
that
was
written
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire.
i
was
on
the
airplane
yesterday
coming
up
here,
and
i
had
a
companion
and
was
attempting
for
not
the
first
time
to
explain
some
of
the
nuances
and
intricacies
of
a
fourth
amendment
case,
and
i
had
an
opportunity
to
review
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire,
and
in
so
doing--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--section
2,
and
as
i
recall--
mr.
james
dexter
clark
--yes,
but
anyway,
at
section
2,
page
454,
mr.
justice
bradley
is
quoted,
and
then
mr.
justice
stewart,
who
wrote
the
opinion,
adds
some
language
of
his
own,
and
in
reading
that
particular
section,
i
handed
it
to
my
companion
and
i
said,
read
this.
i
said,
this
is
why
we
are
going
to
washington
today,
and
this
is
why
i
hope
the
supreme
court
affirms
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
i
can
presume
that
the
court
is
very
concerned
about
the
governmental
interests
involved
in
the
narcotics
trafficking
problem
today,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
governmental
interest
in
narcotics
and
the
trafficking
in
narcotics
is
any
more
important
than
the
governmental
interest
in
preventing
murder
or
armed
robbery.
i
think
the
governmental
interests
that
are
intended
to
be
balanced
in
determining
whether
or
not
fourth
amendment
searches
and
seizures
are
reasonable
are
the
types
of
governmental
interests
that
we
have
in
the
brignoni-ponce
case,
involving
border
crossings
by
immigrants
or
aliens.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
i
think
that
is
probably
all
the
more
reason
that
this
court
should
be
very
aware
and
cognizant
of
the
preservation
of
fourth
amendment
rights
which
have
been
jealously
guarded
by
this
court
throughout
its
history,
most
significantly
in
the
twentieth
century,
but
certainly
from
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century,
when
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
as
being
the
historical
precedents
for
fourth
amendment
rights...
i
hate
to
see
an
erosion
of
those
rights
merely
directed
at
the
prevention
of
narcotics
trafficking.
i
think
that
is
a
selective
governmental
interest
that
will
not
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
it
presently
stands
before
this
court.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
government
apparently
takes
the
position
that
privacy
denotes
only
an
opportunity
to
be
free
from
visual
inspection.
in
other
words,
the
position
that
because
the
bags
were
not
searched,
that
is,
opened,
until
a
warrant
had
been
issued,
the
intrusion
into
mr.
place's
privacy
was
protected,
i
think
that
is
a
rather
narrow
view
of
what
privacy
is.
privacy
certainly
has
as
one
of
what
i
perceive
to
be
three
elements
the
visual
inspection,
but
it
also
has
the
right
to
be
free
from
governmental...
unwarranted
governmental
interference,
and
the
right
to
personal
security.
personal
security
and
the
right
to
be
free
from
interference
were
certainly
not
preserved
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
in
the
cases
of
chadwick
and
sanders,
this
dichotomy
or
actually
trichotomy,
three
elements
of
privacy,
is
recognized.
in
chadwick
and
sanders,
of
course,
we
were
dealing
with
items
of
personalty
again.
items
of
personalty
were
seized
after
the
officers
had
probable
cause.
they
were
not
searched,
they
were
not
visually
inspected
until
after
a
warrant
had
issued.
this
court
accepted
that
proposition,
and
noted
that
the
contents
of
the
bag
were
the
primary
privacy
interest
of
these
two
defendants,
sanders
and
chadwick,
and
that
those
particular
privacy
interests
were
protected.
i
see
implicitly
in
those
decisions
the
fact
that
this
court
recognizes
that
there
is
more
to
privacy
than
being
protected
from
a
visual
inspection.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
dexter
clark
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
the
court,
without
being
redundant,
i
do
want
to
just
basically
pick
up
where
i
began
by
stating
that
i
was
pointing
out
to
the
court
what
i
feel
to
be
significant
in
that
it
is
implicitly
present
in
arkansas
versus
sanders
and
the
chadwick
cases,
and
that
is,
i
have
divided
the
right
to
privacy
into
three
elements
as
opposed
to
the
one
which
is
proposed
by
the
government.
it
is
the
government's
proposition
that
privacy
includes
only
protection
from
visual
inspections
in
these
types
of
cases.
i
would
also
include
among
the
right
of
privacy
the
right
of
personal
security
and
the
right
to
be
free
from
unwarranted
intrusions.
in
the
chadwick
case
and
in
the
sanders
case,
the
items
of
personalty,
the
footlocker,
baggage
that
was
seized,
probable
cause
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
seizure,
and
that,
to
me,
indicates
that
personal
security
and
freedom
from
unwarranted
intrusions
was
protected.
obviously,
that
was
not
the
case
in
this
particular
instance,
because
personal
security
and
the
right
to
be
free
from
intrusion
was
certainly
not
afforded
to
mr.
place.
i
would
also
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
what
i
feel
is
not
the
status
of
the
law
with
regard
to
the
reasonableness
proposition
that
is
being
urged
by
the
government.
they
would
have
the
court
base
all
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
questions
on
the
test
of
reasonableness,
and
i
believe
that
they
will
rely,
as
they
have
indicated
in
their
brief
and
especially
in
their
reply
brief,
on
michigan
versus
summers,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
reading
of
michigan
versus
summers
gives
an
ad
hoc
reasonableness
test
as
the
standard
for
measuring
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
questions.
and
i
look
back
and
take
the
michigan
versus
summers
case,
by
balancing
it
against
dunaway,
and
in
writing
the
summers
case,
mr.
justice
stevens
took
pains
to
point
out
that
the
seizure
in
that
case
was
distinguishable
from
that
in
dunaway.
dunaway
goes
directly
to
the
point
of
rejecting
the
reasonableness
test,
and
in
the
summers
case,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
distinguishing
factors
were
that
a
warrant
to
search
the
house
where
mr.
summers
was
had
previously
been
issued
establishing
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
search
that
particular
house.
also,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
detention
of
mr.
summers
in
the
context
and
under
the
circumstances
of
the
factual
situation
was
not
the
type
of
detention
that
would
lead
to
prolonged
interrogation,
as
was
the
case
in
dunaway.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
michigan
versus
summers
stands
for
the
general
proposition
that
reasonableness
is
a
standard
by
which
all
fourth
amendment
questions
can
be
tested.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
do
so,
as
pointed
out
in
the
dunaway
case,
would
be
to
put
in
the
hands
of
law
enforcement
officers
the
first
instance
of
determining
whether
or
not
reasonableness
existed.
in
closing,
i
ask
and
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
second
circuit's
decision,
and
i
ask
that
this
court
utilize
the
issues
which
are
raised
by
this
case
to
inform
us
all
that
fourth
amendment
rights
will
not
be
diluted
as
proposed
and
put
forth
by
the
government
in
this
case.
thank
you.
