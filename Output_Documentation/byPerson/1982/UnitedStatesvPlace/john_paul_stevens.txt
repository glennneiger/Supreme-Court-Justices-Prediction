mr.
horowitz,
could
i
follow
up
on
justice
rehnquist's
question?
i
guess
we
are
dealing
in
probabilities
here,
aren't
we?
you
want
the
right
to
take
the
luggage
away
based
on
reasonable
suspicion,
which
i
suppose
is
a
standard
of
maybe
30
or
40
percent
of
the
time
you
would
be
right.
doesn't
that
mean
that
conversely,
60
or
70
percent
of
the
time
you
might
be
wrong,
and
you
would
have
to
return
the
luggage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
probably
over
half
the
cases,
because
if
you
have
more
than
50
percent
probability,
you
would
have
probable
cause,
and
you
want
to
have
a
lesser
degree
of
probability
to
justify
the
seizures--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
they
do
want
to
do
it
in
a
significant
number
of
cases
in
which
they
really
are
not
that
sure
they
will
find
anything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
probable
cause
should
be
enough.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
they
want
to
do
it
on
less
than
probable
cause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
want
the
rule
to
cover
the
agent
who
has
only
a
30
percent
likelihood
of
success.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
as
i
say,
we
are
dealing
with
probability.
if
you
have
a
probable
cause
standard,
why,
then
the
likelihood
of
an
unsuccessful
search
is
much
less.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
your
distinction
between
a
search
and
a
seizure
getting
a
little
fuzzy
right
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
do
want
to
watch
what
is
taken
out,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn't
let
him
go
into
the
men's
room,
say,
all
by
himself
with
the
suitcase
and
perhaps
dispose
of
its
contents,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
question,
following
up
on
justice
o'connor's.
supposing
you
didn't
have
many,
many
pounds,
as
you
did
in
this
case,
but
you
have
a
purse
or
a
briefcase,
and
some
concentrated
item.
i
don't
know
if
any
of
these
drugs
can
be
detected
by
small
quantities.
small
enough
that
they
might
be
concealed
within
a
small
glassine
package
or
something
that
might
in
turn
be
inside
the
wallet
where
there
is
money.
would
you
say
that
the
agent
could
supervise
the
withdrawal
of
the
wallet
from
the
purse
to
be
sure
there
is
nothing
inside
the
wallet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
reasonable
suspicion.
that
is
the
basis...
that
is
why
we
got
into
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--including
possibly
in
the
wallet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
the
suitcase
has
in
it
a
big
paper
bag,
and
the
man
says,
i
have
some
private
papers
in
this
paper
bag
that
i
want
to
take
out
of
the
suitcase,
and
you
think,
well,
maybe
that
is
really
the
marijuana.
what
do
you
do
in
that
case?
do
you
let
him
take
the
paper
bag,
or
do
you
examine
the
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
have
not
solved
justice
o'connor's
predicament.
