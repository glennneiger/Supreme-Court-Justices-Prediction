justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
are
you
contesting
basically
the
issue
relating
to
the
seizure
and
detention
of
the
luggage
as
opposed
to
the
subsequent
exposure
to
the
dog
sniff?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
all
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
seizure
and
detention.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
presumably
the
justification
for
the
terry
type
search
and
detention
of
the
person
was
the
protection
of
the
officers
from
the
use
of
weapons
by
the
person
detained.
that
justification,
of
course,
is
not
present
with
the
seizure
and
detention
of
luggage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
would
you
think
that
you
would
apply
the
same
theory
you
are
arguing
should
be
applied
here
to
the
seizure
and
detention
of
a
handbag
or
briefcase
from
a
person?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
it
might
be
a
sufficient
intrusion
that
it
obviously
involves
detaining
the
person?
for
instance,
if
your
keys
and
money
and
all
the
means
of
getting
away
from
the
airport
are
contained
in
your
purse
or
briefcase,
is
that
not
in
effect
a
detention
of
the
person?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
you
really
say
that,
because
most
people
put
private
personal
possessions
in
their
luggage
and
handbags
and
briefcases.
i
think
it
is
rather
a
common
problem,
so
you
need
to
be
aware
of
it
when
you
are
trying
to
urge
an
expansion
of
a--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
they
discovered
that
he
had
a
false
address
on
his
luggage
tags.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
disparity
existed
in
fact.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
any
event,
it
didn't
satisfy
the
police
in
miami.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
he
hadn't
given
them
an
address
or
a
means
whereby
they
could
contact
him.
