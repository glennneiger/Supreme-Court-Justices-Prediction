justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
horowitz,
are
you
in
a
position
to
say,
what
if
the
sniffing
dogs
at
kennedy
had
come
up
negative,
or
whatever
the
expression
is?
how
much
time
in
addition
to
the
90
minutes
would
have
been
required
to
get
the
baggage
back
to
the
respondent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
is
there
some
ordinary
practice
after
you
take
a
person's
bags
to
get
it
back
to
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
time
means
something.
if
they
say,
we'll
return
it
to
you
in
a
couple
of
days,
really,
it
makes
the
90-minute
analysis
kind
of
fall
apart.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
are
in
a
position
to
deliver
it
to
him
immediately
after
the
dog
sniff,
then
perhaps
your
90-minute
time
period
is
justified.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
then
your
distinction
about--
--wasn't
he
innocent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
distinction
then
about
the
difference
between
inconvenience
in
seizing
luggage
and
seizing
the
person
kind
of
falls
apart,
if
the
only
way
the
person
can
get
his
luggage
back
is
to
go
with
his
luggage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
way
of
saying
from
the
record
how
long
the
detention
of
a
bag
that
turned
up
negative
on
the
sniffing
would
have
taken
if
the
government
had
had
dogs
at
laguardia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
certainly
going
to
be
some
delay.
it
is
just
a
question
of
how
long.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
opponent
contests
the
government's
assertion
there,
and
says
that
the
government,
if
it
is
sequestering
an
effect
for
purposes
of
later
search,
isn't
going
to
allow
unilateral
access
to
a
bag
to
get
something
out
of
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
perhaps
it
is
too
short
a
time
for
argument
to
explain
how
that
might
be
done.
your
saying
so
doesn't
convince
me
that
it
could
be
done.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
clark,
you
say
the
suspicions
in
the
case
of
your
client
were
quelled
at
miami.
then
why
did
the
miami
agents
call
ahead
to
laguardia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn't
really
accurate,
then,
to
say
their
suspicions
were
quelled,
because
they
did
call
ahead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
return
of
one
bag
and
the
search
of
the
other
really
wouldn't
help
your
client
much
in
this
case,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
very
case,
your
client's
baggage
was
seized,
and
he
went
his
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
government
would
be
in
a
better
position
here
if
it
had
not
only
detained
the
bag
and
taken
it
to
kennedy,
but
insisted
that
your
client
go
with
it.
is
that
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
some
minimal
detention
is
justified
under
terry,
is
it
not,
if
there
was
in
fact
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
the
bag.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
van
leeuwen
and
conclude
otherwise.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
van
leeuwen
court
didn't
rely
on
that
at
all.
it
said
that
there
had
been
a
detention
that
wouldn't
have
been
justified
under
less
than
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
may
factually
distinguish
van
leeuwen,
but
the
case
does
hold
that
a
parcel
as
opposed
to
a
person
may
be
subjected
to
some
sort
of
reasonable
detention
on
a
terry
type
analysis,
and
not
requiring
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
the
court's
opinion
or
the
opinion
of
the
plurality?
which
part
of
coolidge?
