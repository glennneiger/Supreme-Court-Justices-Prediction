mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
has
several
issues
in
it
that
are
of
great
importance
doctrinally
to
fourth
amendment
law
and
to
federal
law
enforcement.
if
you
analyze
the
sequence
of
events
that
arose
here,
you
begin
with
the
initial
contact
between
the
agents
and
mr.
royer,
and
there
is
an
issue
whether
at
that
point
you
had
a
seizure
of
his
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
simply
a
contact
not
regulated
by
the
fourth
amendment.
that
issue
is
important
because
if
you
had
a
seizure,
you
can
consider
in
the
effort
to
justify
that
seizure
only
the
facts
known
to
the
agents
at
the
time
they
first
approached
mr.
royer,
and
not
facts
that
they
learned
during
the
initial
interview
with
him.
now,
when
the
situs
of
the
transaction
moved
from
the
concourse
to
the
office
nearby,
you
have
a
question
whether
that
movement
was
either
fully
voluntary
and
not
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment,
as
was
said
in
mendenhall,
or
a
continuation
of
an
investigative
detention,
or
an
arrest
requiring
probable
cause.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
first
to
the
arrest
issue,
because
i
believe
that
is
what
the
state
court
rested
on.
there
is,
of
course,
a
final
issue
as
to
whether
the
consent
to
the
search
of
the
suitcases
was
voluntary.
i
won't
address
that.
i
don't
think
it
was
decided
by
the
lower
court.
the
rationale
of
the
lower
court
was
a
fruits
rationale,
that
even
if
the
consent
was
voluntary,
it
was
the
product
of
an
antecedent
illegal
seizure
of
mr.
royer's
person.
now,
i
think
it
is
crystal
clear
that
the
lower
court
used
the
wrong
test
in
identifying
whether
mr.
royer
was
under
arrest
at
the
time
he
was
moved
to
the
office
and
the
consent
was
secured.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
district
court
of
appeal,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
en
banc.
the
opinion
that
is
under
review
here.
that
opinion
suggests
that
the
criterion
for
determining
whether
there
was
an
arrest
requiring
probable
cause
is
whether
the
suspect
was
free
to
leave.
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
if
he
reasonably
believed
he
was
free
to
leave,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
not
for
my
point.
i
absolutely
agree
that
the
test
is
an
objective
one,
and
not
his
subjective
belief
or
the
subjective
intentions
of
the
officer.
but
the
point
that
i
am
making
here
is
that
the
test
of
free
to
leave
is
a
test
that
distinguishes
not
arrests
from
non-arrests,
but
fourth
amendment
seizures
from
non-seizures,
and
it
is
well
settled
that
fourth
amendment
seizures
consist
of
two
kinds
of
things,
the
terry
type
investigative
detention
or
an
arrest.
one
can
be
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
not
amounting
to
probable
cause;
the
latter
requires
probable
cause.
now,
in
deciding
whether
what
happened
here
was
an
arrest,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
strains
the
english
language
and
the
logical
structure
of
fourth
amendment
analysis
to
call
this
an
arrest.
if
you
view
these
events
as
occurring
to
an
innocent
traveler
who
has
mistakenly
been
seized
upon
as
a
possible
drug
courier
by
the
agents,
it
would
be
quite
clear
to
that
person
that
he
had
not
yet
been
arrested,
that
he
was
being
detained
for
a
brief
course
of
investigation
which
would
result
in
his
release
if
he
knew
he
was
innocent
after
the
officers
looked
in
the
luggage.
it
did
not
have
the
indicia
of
duration.
if
you
compare
it
to
dunaway,
you
are
talking
about
moving
him
a
number
of
miles
to
the
police
station,
keeping
him
for
an
indefinite
period
until
he
confessed.
from
the
standpoint
of
mr.
dunaway,
even
if
he
were
innocent,
he
would
have
perceived
what
happened
to
him,
i
think,
quite
clearly
as
being...
having
the
essential
attributes
of
a
formal
arrest,
which
is
the
language
the
court
used
last
term
in
michigan
against
summers.
now,
it
is
important
in
our
view
not
to
place
undue
emphasis
in
defining
an
arrest
on
the
factors
that
the
lower
court
here,
the
en
banc
court
relied
upon,
which
is
movement
or
detention
or
extended
custody
beyond
a
momentary
stop,
because
those
factors
may
arise
in
many
contexts
where
we
believe
that
they
can
be
legitimately
done
as
part
of
an
investigative
detention,
for
instance,
the
detention
of
a
suspected
robber
near
the
scene
of
the
robbery
and
the
question
whether
he
could
be
moved,
let's
say,
a
block
to
the
scene
of
the
robbery
for
purposes
of
a
show-up
without
having
probable
cause.
now,
let
me
say
finally
on
the
arrest
issue
that
if
you
don't
say
this
was
not
an
arrest,
that
does
not
leave
the
subject
of
investigative
detentions
unregulated
under
the
fourth
amendment.
an
investigative
detention,
like
an
arrest,
must
be
reasonable,
and
you
have
the
ability
to
say
in
this
case
that
the
detention
under
the
circumstances
may
have
been
unreasonable,
but
calling
it
an
arrest,
i
think,
would
be
most
unfortunate.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
is
a
difficult
question.
we
know
what
a
formal
arrest
is,
but
i
think--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
don't
have
to.
i
can
know
what
it
isn't
when
i
don't
see
it--
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--without
knowing
necessarily
exactly
what--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
think
what
you
would
look
at
is
the
duration
and
the
reasonable
understanding
of
the
individual
as
to
whether
he
is
likely
to
be
charged
with
a
crime
or
held
for
an
indefinite
period
until
he
is
presented--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--he
couldn't
have
thought...
well,
i
think
it
is
very
important
that
you
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
an
innocent
person,
because
the
purpose
of
these
rules
is
to
protect
against
innocent
people
being
mistakenly
seized
upon
and
imposed
upon
by
police
officers.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
we
are
not--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
the
purpose
of
what...
what
occurred
here,
which
took
about
ten
to
fifteen
minutes,
was
to
secure
his
consent
and
then
carry
out
on
the
basis
of
his
consent
the
examination
of
his
luggage.
if
it
had
turned
up
nothing,
he
clearly
would
have
been
released.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
the
suspect
would
know
what
would
happen.
that
is,
that
he
would
give
his
consent.
there
is
nothing
in
this
situation--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
is
not
his
subjective
state
of
mind.
it
is
what
a
reasonable
person
in
his
situation
would
perceive
based
on
the
officer's
conduct.
i
think
that
is
very
important.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i...
well,
let
me
say
this.
we
strongly
disagree
that
there
was
a
seizure
at
the
point
of
initial
contact.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
test
for
whether
there
is
a
seizure
is
whether
the
person
reasonably
believes
that
he
is
free
to
leave.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
in
the
circumstance,
i
think
it
is
very
important
in
the
circumstance
in
which
there
is
no
clarification
either
by
a
statement
from
the
officer
or
an
inquiry
from--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--certainly
not.
the
search
has
to
be
based
on
a
consent.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
consent
was
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
seizure.
our
position
is
that
if
at
the
time
they
moved
him
to
the
office
he
had
been
seized,
they
had
ample,
reasonable
suspicion--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
search
would
have
to
be
consensual
in
that
case
because
there
was
no
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
saying
that
that
does
not
convert
what
would
otherwise
be
a
valid--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--it
is
a
somewhat
extended
seizure
beyond--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--michigan
against
summers.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
michigan
against
summers.
not
really
in
mendenhall,
because
mendenhall
rested
on
a
consent
rationale,
but
in
summers
quite
clearly
there
was
an
extended
seizure
of,
i
think,
quite
considerably
longer
duration
than
this,
which
involved
moving
him
a
distance
equal,
i
assume,
to
the
distance
that
he
was
moved
in
this
case.
so
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--but
the
court's
discussion
first--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--i
understand,
but
if
you
look
at
the
court's
analysis,
the
court
begins
by
creating
an
analytical
framework
within
which
the
issue
is
to
be
decided.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
have
exactly
like
that.
we
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
justifying
an
investigative
detention,
an
investigative
detention--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
i
am
not
sure
what
that...
i
think
that
the
detention
in
summers
was
investigative.
they
were...
the
execution
of
the
warrant
was
an
investigation,
and
it
was
an
investigation
which
as
it
happened--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
warrant
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
warrant
did
not
authorize
the
detention
of
summers.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
