--at
what
point
in
time
did
the
arrest
become
illegal?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

do
you
agree
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
to
ask
questions?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

what
do
you
mean
by
a
contact?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

so
there
was
a
limited
terry
type
stop
or
seizure
up
to
what
point?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
think
the
conversation
became
unlawful
at
the
moment
the
request
was
made
to
see
the
driver's
license?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
klein,
in
the
summers
decision
that
has
been
mentioned,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
individual
there
was
not
free
to
walk
away.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
rationale
of
that
case,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
under
circumstances
that
create
a
reasonable
suspicion,
the
officers
may
detain
an
individual
for
a
period
of
time.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
probable
cause
to
detain
the
individual
outside
of
his
home?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
refresh
my
recollection,
mr.
klein.
did
the
court
in
sumner
rely
on
terry?
that
was
my
recollection.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
a
terry
type
limited
seizure,
was
my
recollection.
