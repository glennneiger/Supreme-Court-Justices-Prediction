mr.
calvin
l.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
petition
to
review
the
decision
of
the
florida
third
district
court
of
appeal
in
which
the
florida
third
district
court
of
appeal
reversed
both
the
appellate
panel
and
the
trial
court
upon
their
denial
of
the
defendant's
motion
to
suppress.
the
facts
are
extremely
simple.
the
defendant
was
arrested
at
the
miami
international
airport
carrying
65
pounds
of
marijuana
in
his
luggage.
the
state's
witness,
detective
johnson,
an
experienced
narcotics
officer,
testified
generally
as
to
his
training
and
profile,
so-called
a,
so-called
d,
a
profile,
and
the
fact
that
he
observed
thousands
of
passengers
each
week
at
the
miami
international
airport
eight
hours
a
day,
five
days
a
week.
on
january
3rd,
1978,
about
noon,
the
defendant
appeared
at
the
airport.
detective
johnson
testified
that
in
his
experience
and
detective
magdalena's
experience,
it
was
undeniable
that
the
defendant's
conduct
and
demeanor
attracted
their
attention.
the
defendant
was
extremely
nervous,
pale,
uneasy,
looking
about,
and
detective
johnson
testified
that
in
his
experience,
the
defendant
was
not
a
so-called
white
knuckled
flier,
but
rather
was
concerned
about
being
detected.
the
bags
the
defendant
was
carrying
were
very
heavy.
he
had
produced
an
extremely
large
roll
of
cash
to
pay
for
his
ticket.
the
defendant
was
observed
placing
on
the
airline
identification
labels
the
name
of
holt,
and
his
ticket
apparently
was
also
in
that
name
also.
it
was
undisputed
below--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
when
they
examined
his
ticket
and
license
upon
request
at
the
initial
encounter
with
the
defendant,
your
honor.
it
was
undisputed,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
including
through
the
defendant's
testimony,
that
they
approached
him
and
asked
him
if
he
had
a
moment
to
talk,
and
he
said,
fine.
the
defendant
himself
testified
that
upon
request--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor,
they
identified
themselves
as
narcotics
officers,
and
said,
may
we
speak
with
you
a
moment.
the
defendant
himself
testified
that
he
voluntarily
produced
his
ticket
and
his
license
for
their
examination.
they
immediately
noticed
the
discrepancy
between
his
ticket
and
the
baggage
and
the
license,
and
he
explained
that
someone
else
had
made
the
reservation
for
him.
johnson
then
told
the
defendant
that
they
believed
that
he
was
carrying
narcotics,
and
would
he
come
to
a
room
a
few
feet
away
for
further
discussion.
johnson
said
the
defendant
was
thoroughly
cooperative
throughout
the
transaction.
the
detectives
were
in
plain
clothes.
they
displayed
no
insignia.
they
carried
weapons
but
they
were
concealed.
they
did
not...
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
that
they
blocked
his
path
in
any
way.
they
were
courteous
at
all
times.
they
did
not
threaten--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--he
followed
them
to
the
room.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
he
did
not
say
anything.
he
went
with
the
room
to
them.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
your
honor.
there
is
not
a
mendenhall
type
warning,
if
you
will,
in
this
circumstance.
the
defendant
proceeded
to
the
room,
as
did
sylvia
mendenhall,
without
discussion.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
the
ticket
was
in...
evidently
was
in
detective
johnson's
possession
at
all
times,
but
it
was
never
taken
out
of
the--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--pardon
me?
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
but
the
ticket
actually
never
left
the
defendant's
possession.
it
was
always
right
there
with
him,
with
detective
johnson,
as
they
were
carrying
out
the
discussion,
and
as
they
went
to
the
adjacent
room.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
never
left
his
presence.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
he
would
first
of
all
have
to
ask
to
get
the
ticket
back.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
that's
correct,
which
he
did
not
do
in
this
case,
of
course,
but
there
was
also,
as
an
indication
of
the
nature
of
the
transaction,
the
defendant
indicated
himself
that
he
understood
all
that
was
going
on,
and
there
was
no
physical
contact
at
any
time.
detective
johnson,
i
think
important
to
this
court's
consideration
here,
testified
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
adjacent
room
to
avoid
any
embarrassment
to
the
defendant
and
to
avoid
any
possible
violence
in
the
crowded
airport
area.
in
the
room,
which
was
40
feet
away,
they
again
asked
him
if
they
could...
they
initially
asked
him
for
his
consent
to
open
his
suitcase,
and
they
told
him
again
that
they
suspected
him
of
transporting
narcotics.
in
response,
the
defendant
produced
a
key,
unlocked
one
of
the--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think
in
view
of
the--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
view
of
the
extremely
agitated
condition
of
the
defendant,
i
think
a
frisk
would
have
been
appropriate,
but
it
was
not
done.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
two
suitcases.
onof
the
suitcases,
he
had
the
key.
he
unlocked
it.
the
other
suitcase,
he
did
not
have
he
key,
but
he
said
that
they
could
go
ahead
and
open
it
if
they
wanted
to,
and
thereupon
they
opened
it,
and
it
contained
the
marijuana.
the
entire
transaction
took
ten
to
fifteen
minutes.
the
initial
approach
took
a
matter
of
only
a
few
minutes.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
detective
johnson
specifically
testified
that
when
people
refused
to
talk
to
them,
that
if
they
don't
have
enough
facts,
they
let
them
go.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--there
is
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other,
your
honor.
now,
i
was--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--no,
your
honor,
there
was
no
specific
advisement.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not
specifically
advise
him
of
that.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not
specifically
advise
him
of
that.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
well,
they
asked
him
that,
these
questions,
your
honor,
and
the
trial
court
accepted
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
in
fact
the
transaction
was
totally
voluntary.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
your
honor,
i
certainly
wouldn't
have
gone.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i
didn't
know...
i
would
not
have
known
they
were
armed.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
pardon
me?
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i
have
been
to
the
airport
and
made
observations
of
couriers.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
it
was
not
immediately--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
your
honor--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--your
honor,
i
probably
would
assume
they
were
armed.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
your
honor.
that
was
the
defendant's
testimony.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
that
was
not
accepted
by
the
trial
court
in
this
case.
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
voluntary
nature
of
this
transaction,
which
seems
to
be
the
court's
concern,
we
would
submit
that
there
was
evidence
which
the
trial
court
chose
to
believe
in
this
case
that
the
transaction
was
a
voluntary
transaction.
the
defendant
was
a
22-year-old
college
educated
college
graduate.
he
had
a
degree
in
communications.
the
detectives
approached
him,
asked
him
if
he
had
a
moment
to
talk.
the
defendant
voluntarily
produced
his
identification
and
ticket.
he
was
asked
if
he
would
accompany
them
to
a
room
a
few
feet
away.
he
was
asked
if
he
would
consent
to
the
search.
the
defendant
produced
a
key
for
one
bag,
and
said
it
was
all
right.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
the
state
court
certainly
did,
but--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--the
panel
decision
in
the
trial
court
did
not
find
that
he
was
arrested,
your
honor.
what
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
is
reinstate
the
panel
decision
and
withdraw
corresponding--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--they
made
a
finding
based
upon
the
fact
that
his
luggage
had
been
detained
and--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--this
was
in
no
means
an
arrest,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
florida
third
district
en
banc
held,
that
it
was
an
arrest.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
it
is
a
mixed
question
based
upon
the
facts
presented.
we
would
submit--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--i
think
objectively,
the
reasonable
person
innocent
of
crime
is
the
standard
which
this
court
has
articulated.
in
particular,
your
honor,
the
defendant
himself
said
in
the
room
that
he
was
not
under
arrest.
i
think
that
totally
belies
the
third
district
court
of
appeals
conclusion
that
he
was
under
arrest.
in
particular,
we
would
point
to
the
fact
that
the
numerous
reasons
announced
by
the
third
district
court
of
appeals
as
reasons
for
the
arrest
were
not
thought
of
or
dreamed
up
by
anybody
in
the
trial
court.
in
fact,
the
argument
in
the
motion
to
suppress,
the
defendant
said
he
did
what
he
did
because
they
were
police
officers.
that
is
the
only
reason
he
offered
whatsoever.
he
offered
no
other
reason
for
the
detention
which
he
claimed.
we
are
here
years
later
arguing
matters
which
the
trier
of
fact,
the
defendant,
and
the
police
officers
never
thought
of.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
the
en
banc
court.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
record
in
the
trial
court
is
what
we
are
bound
by
here,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
think
there
was
another
thing
that
was
determined
by
the
third
district
court
of
appeal
en
banc.
they
kept
calling
it
the
police
room.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i
think
that
if
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
the
trial
court
to
base...
for
the
trial
court
to
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
was
a
voluntary
transaction,
that
that
must
be
flagrantly
erroneous,
it
must
be
clearly
erroneous,
and
must
be
a
substantial
departure
from
the
constitutional
law
of
this
court.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
well,
that--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
we
have
argued
vigorously
in
our
brief
that
the
standard
here
is,
as
this
court
found
in
mendenhall,
is
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
was
totally
mistaken
in
substituting
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
trier
of
fact
as
to
the
issues
of
fact
before
the
trial
court,
and
that
is--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
you
have
my
offer
in
the
brief,
your
honor,
that
in
fact
after
an
extensive
argument
with
judge
schwartz,
i
stated
to
him
that
in
fact
i
wasn't
there,
i
don't
know
what
the
officers
would
have
done.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
there
was
a
concession,
but
the
concession
was
qualified
in
a
certain
context,
and
that
context
was
that
in
fact
if--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor,
they
do...
they
did,
but
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
the
concession
is
a
dispositive
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i
think
that
the
officers
would
not
have
let
him
leave,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
is...
speculating
what
they
might
have
done
is
not
the
issue.
the
question
is
what
did
they
do.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
innocent
of
crime.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
certainly
it
could
be
a
voluntary
transaction,
irrespective
as
to
the
officer's
intent
in
the
case.
they
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
voluntary
transaction,
and
your
honors,
i
think
at
the
point
where
the
defendant
said,
no,
i
don't
want
to
give
you
consent
to
look
in
my
suitcase,
and
i
want
to
leave,
i
think
that
circumstance
is
a
different
circumstance
than
what
transpired
here.
at
that
point,
the
officers
would
have
had
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
detain
the
defendant
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution,
but
they
never
reached
that
point.
that's
why
my
concession,
which
is
put
in
the
footnote
in
the
third
district
court
of
appeal,
if
we
accept
the
concession
as
it
is
stated
facially,
which
i
say
is
absolutely
incorrect,
and
not
in
proper
context,
that
concession
does
not
affect
the
outcome
here.
the
question
is
what
the
record
shows
as
to
what
transpired
in
the...
between
the--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--no,
your
honor.
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i
have
only
offered
my
statement
of
the
context
of
that
remark.
that
is,
i
stated,
if
the
defendant
had
refused
consent,
then
the
officer--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--because
it's
not
relevant
to
a
determination
of
the
constitutional
issues
here,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
i...
my
analysis
of
the
third
district
court
of
appeal
decision
is
that
they...
the
en
banc
decision,
that
is,
that
they
flatly
decided
that
because
his
luggage
had
been
detained,
and
that
because
his
ticket
was
still
in
the
possession
of
johnson,
that
in
fact
those
factors
created
a
situation
where
he
was
not
free
to
leave
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
flatly
because
of
those
factors.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
district
court
of
appeal.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
frost
went
off
and
said,
as
a
matter
of
law,
when
you
keep
a
defendant's
ticket,
he
is
absolutely
detained.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
they
were
applying
that
ruling
in
frost.
frost
went
on
and
made
a
number
of
other
rulings,
but
they
were
applying
that...
that
is
the
single
factor
which
they
say...
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
are
detained.
now,
that
conflicts
with
elmore,
and
elmore
just
flatly
says,
just
because
the
officer
has
gotten
the
ticket
does
not
mean
you
are
detained.
you
are
not
detained
until
he
leaves
your
presence
with
that
ticket,
and
elmore
is
the
leading
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
frost
absolutely
disregarded
and
severely
criticized
the
elmore
court,
which
was
brought
to
its
attention.
that
holding
was
brought
to
its
attention.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor,
i
have--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
first
of
all,
your
honor,
we
certainly
do
not
abandon
any
arguments
we
raise
in
our
extensive
brief,
including
the
good
faith
exception.
i
would
like
to
address
why
the
voluntariness
issue
in
this
court
should
be
overturned,
and
that
is,
this
court's
various
holdings,
and
we
quote
united
states
versus
price
that
a
finding
of
consent
should
not
be
overturned
unless
it
is
clearly
erroneous.
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
not
so
overwhelming
that
either
this
court
or
the
district
court
of
appeal
en
banc
should
overturn
both
the
panel
opinion
and
the
trial
court
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
the
defendant
just
stated
that
this
was
a
police
room,
and
the
witnesses
so
testified.
in
fact,
johnson
was
asked,
"is
that
an
official
police
room.
"
"no,
it's
a
closet
that
has
shelves
on
one
end.
"
"do
you
have
any
police
paraphernalia
whatsoever
in
that
room?
"
"no,
because
it's
an
area
that
we
really
couldn't
secure
very
well.
"
the
police
room
is
something
that
the
third
district
called
this
room.
it
is
not
something
that
it
was
in
fact.
with
respect
to
why
the
defendant
was
stopped...
assuming
the
defendant
was
detained...
excuse
me...
when
he
was
taken
to
the
room,
he
was
not
detained
because
he
had
american
tourister
luggage,
your
honor.
he
was
detained
because
of
numerous
facts
and
circumstances,
not
the
least
of
which
included
the
profile
as
a
written
indication
of
the
officers'
experience,
and
particularly
his
efforts
to
avoid
detection
as
are
observed
by
the
officers,
and
particularly
johnson's
observations
of
the
defendant's
counter-surveillance,
if
you
will.
certainly,
normal
airline
passengers
don't
conduct
counter-surveillance
to
see

the
alias
was
discovered
at
the
very
moment
of
the
initial
contact
with
the
defendant,
your
honor,
and
that
alias,
elmore,
and
partino,
cited
in
our
brief,
elmore
said,
"it
would
be
a
failure
of
duty
had
the
federal
agents
not
detained
elmore
at
that
point
to
investigate
him
further.
"
now,
that
is
detained
to
investigate
further,
which,
assuming
this
was
a
detention,
that
it
was
absolutely
lawful
under
elmore.
elmore
also
said,
"upon
these
facts,
profile
or
no
profile,
the
officers
also
had
a
right
to
ask
the
defendant
if
he
would
consent
to
the
search
of
his
luggage.
"
patino
reached
exactly
a
similar
result.
with
respect
to
the
test
to
be
applied,
your
honors,
there's
a
two-part
test
here
that
we've
argued
in
our
brief.
first
of
all,
terry
and
mendenhall
held
that
there
is
no
detention
unless
there
is
physical
force
or
a
show
of
authority,
and
neither
one
of
those
circumstances
was
present
in
this
case.
the
second--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--that
is
not
a
show
of
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
it's
a
show
of
the
officers
not
wanting
to
have
a
nervous
courier
react
to
the
fact
that
he
was
about
to
be
taken
out
in
the
everglades
and
left
in
the
trunk
of
an
automobile.
these
officers
identify
themselves
for
that
specific
reason,
that
the
courier
realizes
that
he
is
not
being
trailed
by
somebody
else.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
you
want
to
show
them
the
authority
to--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--alleviate
their
fear
that
somebody
who
is
not
lawful
and
who--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--it
is
not
a
show
of
authority.
merely
identifying
oneself
as
a
police
officer
is
not
a
show
of
authority.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
pardon
me?
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
he
does
it
by
announcing
to
the
defendant,
you
stay
here,
some
sort
of
announcement,
some
sort
of
indication
to
the
defendant.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
merely
a
request
to
open
the
bag
is
not
a
show
of
authority,
your
honor.
this
court
has
so
held
in
schneckloth.
if
this
court
accepts
that
announcement
of
identification
is
a
show
of
authority,
then
we
are
out
the
window
on
the
mere
contact
concept,
which
this
court
accepted
in
mendenhall.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
his
whole
thing
apparently
rests
at
this
point
on
whether
or
not
the
movement
to
the
room
is
some
sort
of
detention.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
merely
a
request.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
that's
a
different
circumstance.
exactly.
that
is
a
show
of
authority.
now,
the
second
part
of
the--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--stay
right
here,
we
are
going
to
get
a
warrant,
that
certainly
is
an
exercise--
mr.
calvin
l.
fox
--assuming
that
had
been
held
in
the
trial
court,
that
would
be
an
exercise
of
authority.
your
honor,
there
is
a
second
part
to
our
analysis
here
as
to
the
test
to
be
applied
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
there
must
be
a
balancing
test
between
the
public's
interest
in...
the
compelling
public
interest
in
law
enforcement
and
the
de
minimus
intrusion
which
is
present
in
this
case,
and
we
would
urge
this
court
to
follow
the
balancing
test
as
articulated
in
michigan
versus
summers.
thank
you.
