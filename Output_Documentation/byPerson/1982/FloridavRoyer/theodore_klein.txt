mr.
theodore
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
royer
was
walking
in
the
airport,
he
was
stopped
by
the
police,
told
that
they
suspected
him
of
carrying
drugs.
he
was
moved
into
a
converted
storage
closet.
they
keep
his
tickets.
they
get
his
bags
without
his
consent.
he
is
told
by
the
police
that
they
would
like
to
look
in
his
bags
to
either
confirm
or
dispel
their
suspicions,
and
he
opens
the
bags.
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
theodore
klein
--the
officer
opens
the
bags.
mr.
theodore
klein
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
contend
that
there
was
any
consent
whatsoever
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
the
exact
words
of
the
agent
when
questioned
about
this
issue
of
consent
was,
we
told
them
we
suspected
him
of
carrying
narcotics,
and
we
asked
him
to
open
the
bags
to
either
confirm
or
dispel
our
suspicions.
mr.
royer,
without
saying
a
word,
took
his
key
out
of
the
bag...
out
of
his
pocket,
opened
the
bag,
unlocked
it,
and
then
the
officer
actually
did
the
opening
of
the
bag.
mr.
theodore
klein
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
klein
we
say
that
it
was
not
voluntary,
your
honor.
we
say...
our
position
basically
under
these
circumstances
is
that--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
he
could
have
said
very
many
things.
mr.
theodore
klein
he
could
have
said
a
number
of
things.
mr.
theodore
klein
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
klein
all
right,
your
honor.
if
he
had
said
that,
then
i
think
that
there
would
be
no
consent
at
all,
if
he
said
you
can
open
my
bags
when
you
get
a
warrant.
i
think
that
would
be
quite
clear
that
there
would
be
no
consent
whatsoever
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
we
can
go
on
the
basis
of
either
the
state's
concession
at
oral
argument
or
as
they
now--
mr.
theodore
klein
--no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
state's
argument
that
is
set
forth
in
their
reply
brief
points
out
specifically
on
page
9,
it
said,
what
would
have...
what
would
have
happened
after
that
is
that
certainly
in
that
event
the
officers
could
have
readily
sought
other
means
of
gathering
information,
including
the
use
of
a
trained
narcotics
dog.
so
i
think
that
their
basic
argument
is
that
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
the
consent
was
ultimately
granted,
then
this
individual
was
not
going
anywhere
until
the
police
had
completed
their
investigation.
now,
we
maintain
that
either
this
situation
represents
the
most
expansive
terry
stop
that
has
ever
been
recognized,
and
possibly
the
most
coercive
consent
that
could
ever
be
validated,
or,
as
we
say,
that
it
was
an
illegal
arrest,
and
regardless
of
the
nomenclature,
it
was
tantamount
to
an
arrest--
mr.
theodore
klein
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
it
is
impossible
to
say
at
the
precise
moment
when
it
occurred.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
i
would
concede
that
there
was
reasonable
suspicion
for
the
officers
to
approach
the
defendant
in
the
airport
and
to
engage
in
a
contact,
and
nothing
more.
mr.
theodore
klein
a
contact
is
a
voluntary
encounter,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
footnotes
in
terry,
and
all
of
its
progeny,
it
is
a
voluntary
encounter.
the
police
are
not
isolated
from
citizenry.
they
are
permitted
to
talk
to
them
and
to
go
and
engage
and
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
something
that
arouses
their
suspicions
any
further.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
we
maintain
that
there
was
a
limited
encounter
that
took
place
in
the
form
of
the
conversation,
and
then
beyond
that
i
think
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
say
that
anybody
who
is
approached
by
officers
in
a
public
place,
regardless
of
whether
they
are
guilty
or
they
are
innocent,
and
the
standard
is
an
innocent
person,
we
maintain
that
an
innocent
person
who
is
asked
by
officers
to
please
show
his
driver's
license
and
his
ticket,
that
it
is
unreasonable
for--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
we
maintain
that
at
the
point
that
they
asked
for...
at
the
point
that
he
was
asked
for
his
driver's
license
and
his
ticket,
at
that
juncture
a
reasonable
person
would
not
feel
that
they
were
free
to
walk
away.
it
is
natural
for
an
individual,
whether
they
are
guilty
or
they
are
innocent,
when
they
are
approached
by
a
police
officer,
to
produce
those
documents.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
michigan
versus
summers
was
a
highly
limited
situation,
and
i
think
that
the
underlying
rationale
there
was
that
the
issue
of
probable
cause
had
already
been
submitted
to
a
neutral,
detached
magistrate.
mr.
theodore
klein
no,
your
honor.
it
was
probable
cause
for
the
search
of
the
house,
and
under
those
circumstances,
a
limited
seizure
detention
of
the
individual
was
appropriate
in
order
to
ascertain
if
there
was
going
to
be
any
evidence
that
was
turned
up
in
the
house.
but
i
don't
think
the
michigan
versus
summers
reflects
the
proper
model
for
determination
of
the
issues
here.
mr.
theodore
klein
it
was
the
owner
of
the
house.
mr.
theodore
klein
that's
correct,
and
that
was
really
the
underlying
rationale,
that
a
neutral,
detached
magistrate
had
issued
a
search
warrant,
and
i
think
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
that
function
should
be
served
by
someone
in
that
position
rather
than
those
who
are
on
the
front
line
such
as
police
who
are
often
engaged
in
the
competitive
aspects
of
ferreting
out
crime.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
it
was
a
terry
extension.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
it
was
a
terry
type
limited
seizure.
mr.
theodore
klein
but
it
was
based
upon
the
rationale
of
a
neutral
magistrate
already
having
secured
a
warrant,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
way
that
that
can
be
justified
under
those
circumstances,
and
it
was
justified
on
the
basis
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
any
individual
or
any
proof
that
might
turn
up
during
the
course
of
the
search
itself,
which
is
far
more
intrusive
in
and
of
itself
than
the
seizure
of
the
individual.
now,
what
our
position
is
is
that
whatever
terry
stop
may
have
been
justified
in
the
first
instance
in
this
matter
became
increasingly
more
custodial
and
ultimately
culminated
in
an
illegal
arrest.
the
traditional
dividing
point
has
always
been,
of
course,
probable
cause.
the
terry
case
recognized
an
intermediate
step
which
was
limited
in
nature
and
in
purpose.
it
is
between
the
contact
and
an
arrest.
articulable
suspicion
permits
a
limited
seizure
of
the
person,
but
it
must
be
done
with
the
clear
caveat
that
whatever
intrusion
takes
place
pursuant
to
this
seizure
must
be
limited
to
that
which
made
its
initiation
permissible
in
the
first
place.
so
that
asking
a
seized
driver
to
get
out
of
his
car
for
the
immediate
safety
of
the
officer
has
been
upheld.
a
patdown,
as
in
terry,
has
been
upheld.
in
fuenta,
martinez,
martinez
fuenta,
border
stop
inquiry
with
reference
to
immigration
status
has
been
upheld,
but
none
of
those
cases
and
none
of
the
terry
line
of
cases
have
expanded
the
intermediate
step
to
the
extreme
here
without
either
requiring
probable
cause
or
calling
it
an
arrest.
so
therefore
the
real
question
is,
is
what
happened
here,
up
to
the
actual
point
of
the
search
of
the
luggage,
can
it
be
justified
as
a
terry
stop.
now,
first
of
all,
i
think
it
is
important
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
mendenhall--
mr.
theodore
klein
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
theodore
klein
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that
whatsoever.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
i
have
no
problem
with
that
whatsoever.
mr.
theodore
klein
even
under
certain
circumstances,
a
movement
may
be
appropriate,
but
it
was
the
combination
of
factors
here.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
that
is
true,
but
if
that
is
the
case,
then
every
time
that
the
police
conduct
a
so-called
terry
stop,
and
they
want
to
avoid
embarrassment
to
the
subject
of
the
terry
stop,
that
would
in
their
rationale
permit
them
to
move
him
off
to
some
isolated
place.
mr.
theodore
klein
and
then
conduct
whatever
it
is
that
they
want
to
do.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
the
lapse
of
time
is
only
one
factor,
and
i
don't
think
this
is
critical
in
this
case.
the
lapse
of
time
has
been
held
to
be
a
long
time
to
be
reasonable.
in
michigan
versus
summers,
two
hours
was
reasonable.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
klein
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor--
mr.
theodore
klein
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
quite
follow
the
question.
if
there
is
an
initial
terry
stop--
mr.
theodore
klein
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
he
could,
if
the
circumstances
were
right.
if
they
hadn't
engaged
in
any
more
coercive
conduct.
mr.
theodore
klein
like
taking
his
ticket,
as
they
did
here.
like
going
and
getting
his
bags
and
putting
them
in
the
room,
isolating
him,
as
they
did
here,
advising
him,
now,
we
suspect
you
under
these
circumstances
of
carrying
narcotics,
we
would
like
you
to
open
the
bag
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
in
there.
mr.
theodore
klein
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
i
think
that
placing
him
in
that
kind
of
a
coercive
atmosphere
makes
it
more
likely.
i
think
it
is
unreasonable
after
an
individual
such
as
this
has
been
removed
to
a
room,
they've
gotten
his
bags,
they've
gotten
his
ticket,
they
tell
him,
now,
we
suspect
you
of
carrying
narcotics,
and
we
would
like
you
to
open
up
the
bag
in
order
to
confirm
or
dispel
our
suspicions,
i
think
it
is
unreasonable
to
think
that
anybody,
guilty
or
innocent,
can
simply
say,
well,
i've
had
quite
enough
of
this,
gentlemen,
i've
got
to
go
on
my
way.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
it's
both.
it's
both.
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
consent--
mr.
theodore
klein
--we
don't
have
to.
mr.
theodore
klein
i
believe
that
it
is.
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
easiest
way
to
decide
this,
is
that
this
was
a
coerced
consent
under
the
circumstances,
and
regardless
of
whether
or
not
we
call
it
an
arrest
or
not,
it
is
a
clear
confinement
which
exceeds
the
scope--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
exact--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
exact
holding
of
the
court--
mr.
theodore
klein
--they
said
that
regardless
of
the
exact
nomenclature
employed
to
describe
this
situation,
it
is
unimportant.
mr.
theodore
klein
i
don't
have
the
supplemental
appendix.
i
am
reading
under
the
section
that
is
consent
invalid,
and
then
then
it
says...
royer
involuntarily
confined
is
the
first
section,
and
then
the
second
section,
number
two,
it's
page
50.
mr.
theodore
klein
pardon
me?
that's
correct.
the
section
that
says
no
probable
cause.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
it
says,
"for
all
practical
purposes,
he
had
been
placed
under
arrest
when
the
alleged
consent
was
given.
"
"the
exact
nomenclature
employed
to
describe
this
situation
is,
however,
unimportant.
"
i
don't
think
that
the
term
"arrest"
should
be
dispositive
of
the
situation,
because
of
his
precise
situation.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
the
consent...
there
was
no
consent,
is
our
position,
is
therefore
invalid,
but
irrespective
of
that,
it
was
a
terry
stop
that
exceeded
the
scope
of
what
is
reasonably
necessary.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor,
it
did,
and
in
connection
with
that,
the
court's
inquiry
of
the
government
as
to
when
a
seizure
becomes
an
arrest,
and
the
government
was
unable
to
come
up
with
a
clear
definition.
well,
i
like
the
definition
that
the
government
itself
gave,
and
that
was
in
their
brief
in
this
case.
they
advert
to
their
brief
in
the
michigan
versus
summers
case,
and
on
page
10,
they
point
out
in
their
brief
that
after
saying
that
dunaway
made
it
clear
that
the
formal
label
is
not
dispositive,
that
"probable
cause
is
required
whenever
there
is
a
sufficiently
substantial
invasion
of
the
suspect's
freedom
of
movement.
"
"what
constitutes
a
sufficiently
substantial
deprivation
of
liberty
to
require
probable
cause
remains
to
be
fleshed
out.
"
"if,
however,
a
detention
is
deemed
to
be
of
sufficient
severity
to
fall
within
this
category,
its
lawfulness
will
not
be
evaluated
by
reference
to
a
general
reasonable
analysis,
but
will
ordinarily
depend
solely
upon
the
existence
of
probable
cause.
"
that's
what
we
have
here,
your
honor.
i
maintain
that
the
terry
stop
exceeded
the
initial
reason
for
the
intrusion.
it
was
unnecessary
to
expand
it
to
the
point
that
it
was.
it
was
unnecessary
under
these
circumstances,
and
therefore
constitutionally
unreasonable.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
by
the
time
he
was
asked
for
his
consent,
he
was
under
arrest,
and
i
think
that
it
is
impossible
to
single
out
any
of
those
crucial
elements
that
i
have
adverted
to,
and
the
court,
the
florida
court,
the
appeals
court
did
not
try
to
distinguish
between
those
crucial
elements,
and
i
think
that
the
government
is
incorrect
when
they
say
that
the
sole
basis
of
the
florida
court's
position
about
an
illegal
arrest
was
based
upon
his...
the
reasonable
apprehension
that
he
was
not
free
to
go.
that
was
merely
one
of
the
factors
that
the
florida
court
adverted
to
in
making
its
ultimate
determination
that
an
arrest
had
occurred.
it
specifically
cited
the
other
instances
of
misconduct
indicating
that
the
man
was
not
free
to
go,
such
as
the...
and
that
he
was
in
effect
in
a
classic
case
of
imprisonment.
mr.
theodore
klein
no,
your
honor,
i
have
not
as
yet,
but
i
will
be
glad
to
address
that
point.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor,
and
on
that
particular
point,
what
our
problem
is
is
that
this
is...
this
terry
stop
was
based
upon
the
so-called
profile,
drug
courier
profile,
and
the
government
has
submitted
in
their
orange
book
to
the
court
a
compilation
of
the
law
and
the
cases,
and
they
point
out,
for
one
thing,
that
there
is
no
national
profile,
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
a
perusal
of
the
cases
that
they
have
in
their
book
shows
that
all
of
the
elements
are
contradictory.
in
one
case,
it
is
the
last
passenger
off
the
plane.
the
next
time,
it
is
the
first
passenger.
no
bags,
heavy
bags,
or
empty
bags.
walking
very
fast,
very
slow.
a
one-way
ticket,
a
round-trip
ticket.
mr.
theodore
klein
they
are
always...
not
always.
sometimes
nervous.
nervousness
seems
to
be
a
factor
in
atlanta
but
not
necessarily
in
los
angeles.

[generallaughter.]
mr.
theodore
klein
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
klein
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
it
is
very
much
like
analyzing
why
the
stock
market
has
gone
up
the
previous
day.
it
permits
the
police
to
take
what
is
essentially
a
hunch.
they
select
out
the
factors
that
fit.
they
give
it
a
label,
and
they
mask
what
is
essentially
a
hunch
and
essentially
arbitrary
action--
mr.
theodore
klein
--there
is
nothing.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
in
some
instances,
that's
true.
first
of
all,
though,
we
are
dealing
with
a
particular
case,
and
here,
this
case,
the
officer
had
all
of
one
month's
experience.
he
had
been
on
the
job
since
november.
this
was
january.
mr.
theodore
klein
all
right.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
all
right,
your
honor,
because
we
are
talking
about
what
essentially
must
be
individualized
suspicion,
and
a
perfect
example
here
is
that
some
of
the
characteristics
that
were
adverted
to
by
the
officer
in
his
testimony
as
to
why
he
suspected
this
person
was
because
he
was
carrying
american
tourister
luggage.
he
said
he
was
carrying
one
old
suitcase,
one
new
suitcase,
and
he
put
them
up
near
the
counter,
and
most
people
carry
their
luggage
with
them.
now,
the
profile
has
its
place.
it
is
an
excellent
administrative
tool
for
the
police
to
use
to
single
out
possible
suspicious
activity
for
further
investigation,
but
it
should
not
be
used
as
a
justification
for
intruding
on
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
theodore
klein
because
the
fact
of
being
part
of
a
profile
in
and
of
itself
should
not
be
used
in
connection
with
a
terry
stop
as
a
substitute
for
individualized
suspicion.
i
think
every
case
since
terry
has
talked
about
individualized
suspicion
as
to
why
it
was
that
a
particular
element
in
the
profile
was
or
was
not--
mr.
theodore
klein
--i
still
think
that
he
needs
to
make
an
individualized
determination
in
every
instance.
i
think
that
that
sort
of
statistical
approach--
mr.
theodore
klein
--i
still
think,
your
honor,
under
those
circumstances,
that
he
has
to
be
able
to
articulate
whether
or
why
any
particular
item
of
behavior,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
on
or
off
the
profile--
mr.
theodore
klein
--he
can
use
a
combination
of
all
of
them,
but
he
still
must
articulate
why
it
is
that
he
believes
that
these
things
lead
him
to
suspect
that
a
crime
is
being
committed.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
i
still
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
that
there
has
got
to
be
some
showing
that
in
this
particular
case
that
they
suspect
him
of
a
crime,
because
each
of
those
things
are
innocent
in
and
of
themselves.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
mendenhall
case
in
footnote
number
6,
justice
powell
specifically
indicated
that
a
mere
profile
match
in
and
of
itself
would
not
take
the
substitute...
it
would
not
be
a
substitute
for
that
sort
of
individualized
suspicion.
its
appearance
on
the
profile
may
or
may
not
have
significance,
but
the
mere
fact
that
it
does
appear
on
the
profile
cannot
be
used
as
a
substitute
to
make
the
determination
that
in
fact
a
suspicion
of
a
crime
has
been
committed.
there
still
must
be
something
that
is
articulated
as
to
why--
mr.
theodore
klein
--no,
i
believe
that
it
has
a
very,
very
useful
approach,
to
single
out
from
the
very
large
universe
of
people
those
whom
there
is
some
unusual
activity
that
would
cause
the
police
then
to
go
and
conduct
a
further
inquiry.
mr.
theodore
klein
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
klein
well,
i
think
we
must
look
at
things
at
the
point
prior
to
the
search.
otherwise...
we
can't
look
at
it
afterwards
as
a
bootstrapping
sort
of
thing,
because
in
every
case
in
which
there
is
a...
a
criminal
case
in
which
there
is
a
motion
to
suppress,
it
means
that
it
works,
but
the
determination
still
must
be
made
prior
to
the
actual--
mr.
theodore
klein
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
no,
they
were
65
together,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
it
was
an
aggregate.
yes.
mr.
theodore
klein
they
were
heavy
suitcases,
your
honor.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it.
but
the
fact
that
somebody
is
carrying
heavy
suitcases
does
not
give
one
the
kind
of
articulable
suspicion
that
a
crime
is
being
committed.
mr.
theodore
klein
pardon
me.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
it
is
a
factor,
but
it
still
does
not
show
why
a
crime
has
been
committed.
the
fact
that
it
is
american
tourister,
or
that
it
is
a
heavy
suitcase,
the
fact
that
the
person
looked
nervous...
and
by
the
way,
there
is
a
case
that
says...
pointed
out
as
one
of
the
characteristics
that
the
defendant
looked
very
calm,
so
again,
there
is
a
contradiction
to
every
single
one
of
these
items
that
occurs.
mr.
theodore
klein
no,
i
believe
that
it
is
very
useful
for
the
police
to
go
and
to
make
the
initial
contact
so
that
they
don't
have
to
just
select
people
out
at
random
to
see
whether
or
not
they
are
drug
couriers
in
an
airport,
and
at
that
point,
then,
they
would
go
and
make
their
contact.
now,
if
the
state
and
the
government
are
fearful
of
a
person
getting
away
with
crime,
the
police
don't
have
to
shrug
their
shoulders
and
simply
walk
away.
they
can
still
limit
the
intrusion
to
the
reason
within
the
terry
standards.
mr.
theodore
klein
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all,
your
honor.
they
could
do
it--
mr.
theodore
klein
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
if
you
would
apply
that
to
this
case,
then
there
would
be
no
seizure
at
all
in
the
first
instance,
but--
mr.
theodore
klein
--yes,
your
honor,
there
are.
mr.
theodore
klein
first
of
all,
the
ticket
was
handed
back
in
mendenhall.
the
trial
court
made
a
specific
finding
in
mendenhall
that
mrs.
mendenhall
had
agreed
to
go
to
the
room
in
a
spirit
of
cooperation.
she
was
never
told--
mr.
theodore
klein
--all
right.
she
was
never
told
either
out
in
the
concourse
or
in
the
office
that
she
was
suspected
of
carrying
narcotics,
so
that
there
is
a
focus
issue
that
is
involved
there.
there
was
no
retrieval
of
her
luggage.
she
was
advised
in
the
room
of
her
right
to
refuse.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
again,
i
still
would
have--
mr.
theodore
klein
--if
that
took
place
out
in
the
concourse,
i
would
have
no
problem
with
it,
and
in
fact
i
think
that
if--
mr.
theodore
klein
--yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
now
we
are
beginning
to
build
hypothets
that
i
can't
answer,
because
i
think
that
it
may
or
may
not
be.
mr.
theodore
klein
then
we
are
closer
to
a
mendenhall
situation.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
then
perhaps
we
get
closer
to
a
mendenhall
situation,
but
that's
not
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
and
i
think
again
in
order
to
determine--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
that's
correct,
but
i
think
in
order
to
determine
these
issues
of
the
scope
of
the
terry
seizure,
that
we
have
got
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
terry
poll
stars,
and
see
what
it
is
that
is
sought
to
be
accomplished,
and
one
of
the
things
that
must
be
determined
is
how
far
we
can
extend
this
terry
stop
without
running
afoul
of
the
original
principle.
the
whole
object
of
all
of
the
terry
cases,
including
the
investigative
stop
cases,
is
that
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
must
be
limited
to
the
reason
for
the
initial
seizure,
and
that
is
what
justified
the
terry
rationale
in
the
first
place.
now,
if
we
limit
that
under
these
circumstances
to
the
terry
seizure,
then
i
think
it
is
clear
that
whatever
occurs
should
occur
out
there
in
the
concourse.
it
is
constitutionally
unreasonable
to
take
all
the--
mr.
theodore
klein
--why
should
it
be?
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
i
agree,
but
that
is
what
the
court
has
said,
that
that
is
the
test,
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
way--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
the
cases
have
said
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
"seizee"
is
under
the
reasonable
belief
that
he
was
not
free
to
walk
away.
i
think
it's
a
very,
very
difficult
rationale
to
apply,
but
nevertheless
that
is
the
standard
that
this
court
has
adopted--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
i
think
that
it's
a
number
of
cases
that
follow
terry,
and
i
think
that
under...
i
can't
recall
exactly
which
of
those
cases,
but
the
question
has
always
been
stated
under
whether
or
not
the
seizee--
mr.
theodore
klein
--all
right.
my
own
feeling
is
that
that
is
an
unworkable
standard,
that
it
ought
to
be
a
standard
as
to
whether
or
not...
whether
or
not
some
act
is
done
by
the
police
officer
that
would
reasonably
indicate
that
the
defendant
was
not
free
to
go,
not
the
subjective
standard
of
what
was
in
the
defendant's
mind,
because
that's
an
impossible
standard
to
apply,
and
i
think
that
looking
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities
rather
than
from
the
subjective
standard
of
the
defendant
makes
a
lot
more
sense.
and
looking
at
it
from
that
standard,
if
a
police
officer
asks
an
individual
on
the
street
or
anywhere,
can
i
see
your
license,
it
is
unreasonable
to
believe
that
the
person
thinks
that
he
can
freely
walk
away
without
giving
up
his
license
or
without
arousing
further
suspicion.
mr.
theodore
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
again,
we
are
talking
about
what
would
happen
afterwards
on
the
basis
of
a
hypothetical.
now,
if
the
state
and
the
government
are
fearful
of
a
person
in
mr.
royer's
position
getting
away
with
crime,
the
police
do
not
have
to
shrug
their
shoulders
and
walk
away.
they
can
still
limit
the
intrusion
to
the
reason
within
the
terry
standards
and
yet
carry
on
with
a
number
of
efficacious
techniques.
they
can
continue
the
brief
seizure
on
the
spot.
they
can
continue
the
questioning.
they
can
ask
there
if
he
would
consent.
they
can
check
with
the
ticket
agent.
they
can
do
a
dog
sniff
of
his
luggage.
also,
they
know
that
he's
getting
on
a
plane,
and
they
know
where
he's
going
to--
mr.
theodore
klein
--pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
klein
how
long?
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
standard
just
has
to
be
one
of
whether
or
not
it
is
reasonable,
and
i
don't
think
that
they
can--
mr.
theodore
klein
--your
honor,
if
it's
a
seizure
on
the
spot,
i
think
that
they
could
retain
his
ticket.
that
would
be
a
means
of
holding
him
on
a
leash,
because
if
there
is
a
proper
terry
seizure
in
the
first
instance,
then
i
would
think
that
under
those
circumstances
it
would
be
reasonable
to
hold
their
ticket
while
they
are
questioning
him
on
the
spot,
but
if
they
are
going
to
attempt
to
remove
him
to
some
other
place,
then
in
order
to
expand
that,
they've
got
to
have
some
legitimate
reason
why
it
is
necessary
to
go
to
another
place
other
than
the
general
law
enforcement
objectives.
mr.
theodore
klein
i
think
that
that
would
be
appropriate
under
those
circumstances.
they
can
ask
for
a
consent
there,
but
it
was
merely
the
coercive
elements
that
inhered
in
the
situation
in
this
instance.
also,
they
know...
i
started
to
give
some
reasons
as
to
why
it
was
that
they
could
conduct
it
in
another
manner.
he
is
getting
on
a
plane
for
new
york,
so
they
know
very
well
where
he
is
going
to
be
for
the
next
two
and
a
half
hours.
and
the
agent
testified
in
this
case
that
he
is
in
constant
communication
with
agents
in
every
other
city
throughout
the
country,
checking
on
passengers
coming
and
going
in
these
instances,
so
it
is
very
easy
for
them
to
do
what
they
have
to
do.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
it
is
not
just
the
movement
of
the
15
steps.
first
of
all,
they
put
him
into
a
converted
storage
closet.
it
could
be
five
steps,
but
once
they
move
behind
a
door
which
is
only
three
inches
wide--
mr.
theodore
klein
--it
was
defined
by
the
police
as
a
converted
storage
closet.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
the
officer
did
testify,
contrary
to
what
the
state
says,
that
it
was
a
police
room.
it
was
outfitted
with
a
desk
and
two
chairs,
and
it's
impossible
to
say.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate.
mr.
theodore
klein
pardon
me?
mr.
theodore
klein
yes.
mr.
theodore
klein
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
would
be
an
element,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
is
dispositive
at
all.
i
think
that
the
coercive
elements
that
all
combined
in
this
case
added
up
to
the
situation
that
existed
here.
mr.
theodore
klein
it
could
be
an
illegal
arrest.
mr.
theodore
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
i
would
say
that
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
klein
if
there
was
probable
cause,
even...
oh,
if
there
was
probable
cause,
no.
i
would
say
not.
under
schneckloth
it
would
be
an
acceptable...
it
would
be
an
acceptable
standard.
mr.
theodore
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor,
it
could.
