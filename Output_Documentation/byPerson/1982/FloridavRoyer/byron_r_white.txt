justice
white
that
was
on
his
baggage,
you
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
identify
themselves
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
did
he
say
when
they
asked
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
they
indicate
that
he
didn't
need
to
go,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
once
it
was
handed
over.
did
he
hand
it
to
the
police?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
when
they
first
stopped
him
he
had
said
no,
i
don't
particularly
care
to
talk
to
you,
i
don't
particularly
care
to
identify
myself,
or
hand
you
over
my
ticket?
would
he
have
been
free
to
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
had
said,
when
they
asked
him
to
go
into
the
other
room,
he
had
said,
no,
i
don't
want
to,
the
testimony
is,
they
would
have
let
him
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
gets
to
the
room,
and
they
say,
may
we
search
your
suitcase,
and
he
says,
no,
you
may
not.
what
is
the
testimony
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
officers
were
in
plain
clothes,
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fact
that
they
were
armed
wasn't
immediately
evident.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
how
you
can
miss
it.
but
they
did
say
they
were
narcotics
agents.
justice
byron
r.
white
unarmed.
and
unarmed,
that
is
rather
rare,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
had
been
accosted
by
two
narcotics
agents
who
identified
themselves,
would
you
assume
they
were
armed
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
difficulty
with
that
submission
is
that
the
state
courts
found
that
he
was
detained
against
his
will.
they
found
he
was
arrested.
justice
byron
r.
white
must
we
overturn
that
to
relieve
you
of
this
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
we
have
to
disagree
with
the
florida
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
made
a
finding
based
on
the
record,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
it
was,
you
do
say,
turn
that
conclusion
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
must
a
state
have...
must
a
state
appellate
court
have
some
standard
about
overruling
its
trial
courts?
what
standard
does
the
constitution
require?
here
surely
the
florida
appellate
court
overruled
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
be
that
if
it
applied
the
wrong
legal
standard
in
adjudicating
the
federal
constitutional
question,
we
could
certainly
correct
that,
and
even
if
it
didn't
apply
the
right...
even
if
it
applied
the
right
standard,
we
could
disagree
with
it
if
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
officers
may
have
decided
in
their
own
minds,
we
will
never
let
him
go,
but
a
reasonable
person
might
have
thought
that
he
was
free
to
go.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
en
banc
court
did
find
that
the
defendant
was
under
the
reasonable
impression
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave,
not
just
a
subjective
impression,
but
on
the
objective
facts,
he
was
under
a
reasonable
impression
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave.
so
that
in
order
to
find
for
you,
we
must
disagree
with
that
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
was
under
the
reasonable...
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
was
under
the
reasonable
impression
he
was
not
free
to
leave.
that
is
what
they
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that
it
said
whether
he
reasonably
believed
he
was
free--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
is
quite
different.
that
is
quite
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
apparently
agree
that
there
was
a
seizure,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
you
say
that
if
you
accept
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeal's
finding,
at
least
there
was
a
seizure.
there
may
not
have
been
an
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
but
you
do
agree
that
at
least
it
is
the
right
test
for
the
seizure,
if
a
person--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
is
the
right
test
for
seizure.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
state
that
even
if...
if
there
was
a
seizure
here,
under
the
right
test,
and
you
haven't
said
there
wasn't
yet,
you
wouldn't
think
that
would
give
the
officers
ipso
facto
the
right
to
search
his
luggage.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
assume
everybody
agreed
there
was
a
valid
terry
stop.
there
is
a
quick
frisk,
and
the
fellow
says,
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question.
may
i
search
your
luggage?
the
fellow
says,
sure,
and
right
on
the
spot,
right
then,
in
30
seconds,
the
luggage
is
searched.
you
say
that,
a,
there
is
a
seizure,
but
b,
it
is
a
completely
consensual
search.
that
is
your--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
and
your
only
difference
is
that
they...
instead
of
searching
him
on
the
spot,
they
moved
him
into
another
room.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
certainly
extends
the
seizure,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
we
ever
approved
that
kind
of
seizure?
mendenhall.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
summers?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
was
incident
to
the
issue
of
the
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here's
a
person
who
came
out
of
the
house
that
was
about
to
be
searched.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
nothing
like
that
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
one
is...
we
don't
have
any
cases
justifying
this
long
of
an
investigative
detention.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
was
at
least
authorized
by
a
warrant,
which
is
the
whole
argument
here--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
there
was
no
warrant
for
the
search
of
the
luggage.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
was
the
person
detained
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
house
was
covered
by
a
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
what
i
asked
your
colleague?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
voluntary
stop,
even,
you
would
say
that
is
a
voluntary
stop,
a
quick
patdown
and
one
question,
may
i
search
your
luggage.
the
man
says
yes.
the
luggage
is
searched.
wouldn't
the
only
question
be
the
question
whether
the
consent
was
voluntary?
you
wouldn't
say--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
you
wouldn't
say
that
just
because
there
was
a
seizure,
a
momentary
seizure
under
terry,
that
his
consent
to
search
would
be
an
invalid
fruit?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that...
let's
assume
there
was
a
valid
terry
stop
here
initially.
just
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
had
then
asked
him,
may
we
search
your
luggage,
and
he
said
yes,
and
they
searched
it
right
on
the
spot,
no
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
just
the
movement
into
the
other
room?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
just
the
lapse
of
time,
or
is
it
the
change
of
atmosphere
which
makes
it
reasonable
for
somebody
to
think
that
he
is
still
being
detained?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
let's
concede
there
was
an
initial
seizure,
as
in
my
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
terry
stop
and
seizure,
and
then
he
is
just
moved
somewhere,
and
they
ask
him,
may
we
search
your
luggage,
and
he
says
yes.
that
consent
then
is
bad,
although
it
wouldn't
have
been--
justice
byron
r.
white
--a
voluntary
stop
initially--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
a
seizure,
and
they
take
him
away
to
another
place,
and
five
minutes
later
they
ask
him,
may
we
search
your
luggage,
and
he
says
yes.
you
think
that
is
necessarily
a
fruit
of
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
can
consent
to
searching
his
luggage
initially--
justice
byron
r.
white
--under
a
valid
stop,
why
can't
he
validly
consent
to
it
five
minutes
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
makes
it
more
likely
that
he
would
consent
to
searching
his
bags?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
conclusion
then
that
his
consent
is
coerced,
or
that
there
is
an
arrest
and
a
fruit
of
an
invalid
arrest?
that
is
a
completely
different
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
need
to
get
to
the
arrest
then.
it
is
just
a
coerced--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it's
just
a
coerced
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
below
didn't
decide
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
below
said
there
was
an
arrest
and
a
fruit
of
an
invalid
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
it
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
said
there
was
an
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
we
have
held
that
even
so-called
voluntary
consents
or
voluntary
statements
after
an
invalid
arrest
are
still
fruits--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
inadmissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
finding
them
coerced.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
submission
here?
is
it
that
the
consent
was
coerced
and
therefore
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
thereupon
became
an
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
haven't
argued,
unless
i
have
missed
it,
that
there
was
not
even
any
grounds
for
a
valid
terry
stop
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
part
of
your
submission,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
always
nervous.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
say
again
that
in
your
position
the
profile
is
perfectly
useless.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
not
suggesting
that
they
have
to
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
go
up
and
ask
the
fellow
just
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
let's
assume
on
these
facts
you
applied
the
rationale
of
the
plurality
in
mendenhall.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
would
you
be
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
mendenhall.
justice
byron
r.
white
apply
that
to
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
facts
aren't
really
different
from
mendenhall,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
there
more
of
a
seizure
here
than
there
was
in
mendenhall?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
finding.
i'm
talking
about
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
there
was
no
reasonable
suspicion
in
this
case,
there
was
just
the
profile,
and
assume
we
agreed
with
you
that
that
doesn't
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion,
but
nevertheless
it
did
sort
this
person
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
go
up
to
him,
and
you
say,
may
i
ask
you
some
questions?
we
are
narcotics
officers,
and
we
suspect
you
of
carrying
narcotics.
we
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
may
we
search
your
luggage,
and
he
says
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
goes
up
to
him,
we
are
narcotics
officers,
we
suspect
you
of
carrying
narcotics,
but
we
have
no
articulatable
suspicion
about
that.
one
question.
would
you
come
over
and
let
us
search
your
luggage
in
this
room
over
here?
and
he
says
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
doesn't
say...
now
they
just
say,
will
you
come
over
to
this
room,
and
he
says
yes,
and
he
gets
over
there,
and
they
say,
may
we
search
your
luggage.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
justice
stewart
said
that
is
just
complete
consent
all
the
way
down,
no
seizure,
no
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
of
the
government's
arguments
is
that
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
the
test
of
a
seizure
be
what
the
seizee
reasonably
thought
about
whether
he
was
free
to
go
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
because
on
that
basis,
you
probably
will
never
permit
the
police
to
go
up
to
anybody
and
say,
may
i
ask
you
a
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
it
rest
on
some
act
of
compulsion
or
show
of
force
by
the
police?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
cases
was
that?
what
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
one
case,
have
five
justices
agreed
to
that?
it
was
justice
stewart's
opinion
joined
by
one
other
justice
in
mendenhall.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
one
way
to
find
out,
and
that
is
by
saying
no.
justice
white
the
size
of
a
closet
with
a
desk
and
two
chairs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
the
officers
said,
we
hereby
arrest
you,
and
then
they
asked--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
let's
assume
there
was
even
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
say,
may
we
search
your
suitcase,
and
he
says
yes.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
consent
necessarily,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
case
turned
on
the
voluntariness,
it
could
be
found
completely
voluntary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
still
could
be
a
difference
between
asking
a
person,
may
we
search
your
luggage,
and
saying
to
him,
stay
right
here,
now,
open
your
luggage,
we
are
officers.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
an
exercise
of
coercion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
or
saying,
now,
open
your
luggage,
we
order
you
to
open
your
luggage.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
the
respondent,
royer,
was
stopped
by
police
officers
as
he
was
about
to
board
a
plane,
the
florida
airport.
the
officers
told
him
he
was
suspected
of
carrying
drugs.
he
accompanied
them
to
a
room
off
the
concourse
and
there
he
consented
to
the
search
of
his
luggage,
which
the
officers
had
retrieved
from
the
airline.
drugs
were
found
in
each
of
two
suitcases.
the
trial
judge
denied
royer's
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence,
but
--
and
he
was
convicted.
the
florida
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
conviction
holding
that
when
royer
gave
his
consent,
he
was
being
illegally
detained
and
hence,
his
consent
was
tainted
and
the
evidence
was
inadmissible.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
affirm
that
judgment.
however,
there
is
not
an
opinion
for
the
court.
i
have
filed
an
opinion
stating
why
justice
marshall,
justice
powell
and
justice
stevens
and
myself
would
affirm
the
judgment.
justice
brennan
would
also
affirm
and
has
filed
an
opinion.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
--
justice
blackmun
and
justice
rehnquist
have
each
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
chief
justice
