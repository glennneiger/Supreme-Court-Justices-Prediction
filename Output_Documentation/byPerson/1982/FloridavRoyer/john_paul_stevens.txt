justice
john
paul
stevens
who
had
possession
of
the
ticket?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wait
a
minute.
you
said
never
left
his
possession.
i
thought
he
handed
it
to
the
detective.

justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
was
in
the
possession
of
the
detective.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
he
wanted
to
get
on
the
airplane,
he
would
have
had
a
little
difficulty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fox,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
you
mentioned
the
violence
concern
that
the
officer
expressed.
do
you
think
the
facts
that
were
known
to
the
officer
at
the
time
he
requested
the
ticket
would
have
justified
a
frisk
of
the
passenger
for
weapons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
officer
frisk
the
passenger?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
go
ahead.
well,
isn't
it
also
true
they
showed
them
their
badge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
also
said
they
had
been
expecting
him,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
fox,
just
to
interrupt
for
a
moment,
what
is
the
court
that
we
should
look
to
for
the
facts,
the
trial
court
or
the
appellate
court?
it
is
a
state
court,
and
i
suppose
we
have
a
limited
right
to
disagree
with
them
on
the
facts,
and
the
appellate
court
did
say
he
was
in
fact
not
free
to
leave.
they
said
that
unequivocally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
standard
of
review
do
we
follow
in
deciding
whether
or
not
a
state
appellate
court
was
wrong
in
disagreeing
with
the
state
trial
court
on
the
facts?
is
it
clearly
erroneous,
or
substantial
evidence,
or
what
is
the
standard
we
should
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
it
have
a
concession
that
the
state
made
at
the
oral
argument
before
that
court
which
they
refer
to
that
the
state
conceded
at
oral
argument
that
the
officers
would
not
have
permitted
royer
to
leave?
we
don't
have
that
before
us,
but
they
had
it
before
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
telling
us
there
was
no
such
concession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i
am
suggesting
to
you
is,
we
have
something
different
before
us
than
they
had
before
them.
they
heard
your
argument
there.
we
didn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
the
issue
is
what
a
reasonable
person
would
have
thought
about
whether
he
was
free
to
leave?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
frey,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question?
you
say
the
court
used
the
wrong
test
in
the
free
to
leave
business
for
an
arrest.
how
would
you
phrase
the
test
of
an
arrest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that
is
the
wrong
test,
you
ought
to
know
what
the
right
test
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
have
a
test
to
propose
to
us
that
is
better?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
under
that
test,
if
one
believed
the
testimony
that
the
man
said...
he
must
have
thought
he
was
going
to
be
charged
with
a
crime,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
an
innocent
person
who
is
just
patient
and
knows
if
he
waits
out
several
hours,
say,
in
the
room--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--he
knows
he
will
get
free
eventually.
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
arrest
turns
on
what
happens
after
the
investigation
is
over?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
it
all...
so
you
are
backing
into
a
corner
where
it
is
the
suspect's
state
of
mind
that
determines
whether
the
officer's
conduct
constitutes
an
arrest,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
can
they
continue
the
questioning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
long
can
they
continue
the
questioning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
they
retain
the
man's
ticket
while
they
do
the
questioning,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
i
understand
you
to
say,
then,
that
if
they
had
asked
him
in
the
terminal
rather
than
in
the
office
to
open
the
bags,
you'd
have
no
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
an
officer
make
a
show
of
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
an
officer
make
a
show
of
authority
if
he
doesn't
by
identifying
himself
and
showing
the
authorization
to
act
as
an
officer?
