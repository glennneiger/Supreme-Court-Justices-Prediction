justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
precisely
does
the
holding
that
something
was
an
arrest
mean?
is
that
basically
a
factual
issue
or
a
legal
issue,
or
is
it
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
imply
a
determination
by
whoever
is
making
the
finding
that
subjectively
the
person
felt
he
was
not
free
to
go,
or
that
objectively
a
reasonable
person
in
his
position
would
not
have
felt
free
to
go,
which
of
those
two?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fox,
could
you
turn
to
page...
if
you
have
it
before
you,
page
49
of
the
supplemental
appendix,
which
i
think
contains
the
opinion
of
the
d.c....
or
perhaps
you
are
familiar
enough.
i
just
wanted
to
read
you
one
sentence
which
i
think
is
what
the
dca
said
about
this
thing.
do
you
call
them
dca's
in
florida?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
said,
"applying
the
test
adopted
in
frost,
it
is
obvious
that
royer,
as
he
himself
testified,
was
under
the
reasonable
impression
that
he
was
not
free
to
leave
the
presence
of
the
officers.
"
and
then
i
guess
it
is
a
cite
to
the
frost
opinion.
now,
why
did
they
incorporate
the
test
adopted
in
frost
in
what
would
otherwise
appear
to
be
pretty
much
of
a
factual
finding?
did
frost
say
something
about
when
you
would
find
that
someone
was
under
a
reasonable
impression?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
were
simply
applying
frost
to
this
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
reading
from
in
the
supplemental
appendix?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
probable
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says
royer
had
been
placed
under
arrest,
no
probable
cause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
point
are
you
trying
to
make.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
point
are
you
trying
to
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
arbitrary
about
following
a
hunch?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
personally
am
not
persuaded
that
police
officers
enjoy
running
around
after
red
herrings
or
running
after
people
who
really
aren't
going
to
provide
any
leads
or
clues.
shouldn't
the
courts
give
some
deference
in
this
situation
to
the
considered
experience
of
law
enforcement
personnel,
just
on
the
basis
that
they
are
the
ones
on
the
scene,
and
probably
know
a
little
bit
more
about
it
than
we
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
profile
was
presumably
devised
by
people
other
than
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
one
month's
experience
have
to
do
with
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
government
could
produce
evidence,
which
i
take
it
it
hasn't
here,
that
if
each
of
these
elements
of
the
profile
when
they
were
run
down,
70
percent
of
the
follow-ups
indicated
a
person
who
was
probably
guilty
of
some
offense
and
30
percent
didn't.
now,
would
you
say
that
an
officer
couldn't
simply
apply
that
profile
across
the
board
if
it
were
documented
in
that
way,
without
making
any
further
individualized
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
individualized
determination
he
makes
was
that
this
person
whom
i
am
following
now
exhibits
eight
of
the
ten
characteristics
that
the
profile
says
to
look
for,
and
each
of
those
ten
characteristics
is
documented
by
experience?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not
past
experience?
if
80
percent
of
the
follow-ups
in
the
past
of
people
with
a
particular
kind
of
luggage
have
indicated
that
you
find
a
guilty
person,
why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
adequate
basis
of
using
that
in
the
case
of
an
expert
who
comes
along?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
but
that
is
a
very
fallacious
approach
of
the
undistributed
middle,
which
really
doesn't
mean
anything
in
this
kind
of
situation.
you
say...
you
keep
referring
to
what
you
think
and
what
you
believe.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
cases
from
this
court
support
your
view
that
a
profile
of
this
sort
is
not
usable
in
any
circumstances?
