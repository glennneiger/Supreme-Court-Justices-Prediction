chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
florida
against
royer.
mr.
fox,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
the
officer
find
out
that
he
bought
a
one-way
ticket,
if
that
was
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
carrying
two
suitcases,
was
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
court
of
appeals
of
florida
have
anything
before
it
that
we
haven't
before
us
in
this
case
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--with
the
consent
of
your
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
he
get
the
key?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
that
was
not
voluntary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--don't
you
think
he
could
have
said,
you
can
open
my
bag
when
you
get
a
warrant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--i
am
just
posing
one
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
just
posing
one
hypothetical,
not
many.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we
don't
know
what
would
have
happened,
whether
he
would
have
been
detained
while
they
went
to
get
a
warrant,
or
whether
they
would
have
opened
it
without
a
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
state's
concession
isn't
evidence
in
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
indicated
that
you
thought
the
initial
stop
was
perfectly
valid,
the
stop
and
the
inquiry.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
it
was
about
roughly
15
steps
from
where
they
then
stood
to
the
room.
at
what
point
did
he...
you
say
he
became
under
arrest?
the
first
step,
fifth
step,
tenth
step?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
particular
item
or
the
combination
of
all
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
worked
pretty
well
here,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
worked
pretty
well
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
were
emphasizing
the
individual
components
here
some
time
back.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
turned
out
that
one
of
these
suitcases
weighed
65
pounds.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
quite
a
lot
for
two
suitcases
for
the
size
indicated
by
this
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
standing
alone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
standing
alone.
but
it
is
one
of
the
factors,
you
would
concede.
chief
justice
burger
the
logical
result
of
what
you
say,
that
they
could
have
required
him
to
open
his
suitcases
right
on
the
spot--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--in
your
response
to
justice
stevens,
but
because
he
takes
15
steps
to
save
him
some
public
embarrassment,
then
they
lose
some
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
call
it
a
closet.
how
big
was
the
room,
as
long
as
you
have
defined
it
as
a
closet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
fox,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
they
discover
that
he
was
using
a
false
name,
at
least
a
different
name?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
friend
has
conceded
that
they
could
have
told
him
to
open
the
bags
immediately
on
the
spot.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
show
of
authority
or
an
exercise
of
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
florida
against
royer
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
justice
white.
