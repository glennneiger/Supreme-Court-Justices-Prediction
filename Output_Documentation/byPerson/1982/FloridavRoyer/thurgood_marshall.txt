did
the
officers
at
any
time
tell
him
that
he
was
free
to
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
also
tell
him
that
he
was
free
not
to
turn
his
ticket
loose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
did
they
also
tell
him
he
didn't
have
to
go
to
the

with
them?
justice
thurgood

[generallaughter.]
is
there
any
evidence
that
he
knew
that
they
were
armed?
and,
i
mean,
how
many
people
do
you
know
wouldn't
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn't
go?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
tried
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
the
only
reason
we
disregard
this
finding
of
the
court
that
you
did
make
a
concession
is
that
you
deny
it
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
else
do
we
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
other
reason
do
you
have
for
us
to
disregard
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
they
say
they
were
officers?
isn't
that...
they
showed
him
a
badge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it
a
show
of?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
must
not
object
to
the
word
"authority".
you
want
to
show
them
the
authority
to
protect
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
to
show
them
authority.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
want
to
show
them
authority
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
asked
him
to
open
the
baggage.
would
that
be
a
show
of
authority?
