justice
marshall
well,
does
the
statute
do
that,
or
the
person
who
pickets
do
that?
justice
marshall
what...
what
infers
that
this
court
would
be
influenced
by
one
person
holding
a
sign?
justice
marshall
well,
is
that
what
congress
has
said?
justice
marshall
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
any
other
building
in
this
city
that
has
this
special
protection?
justice
marshall
well,
how
do
you
single
this
one
out?
justice
marshall
well,
those
people
couldn't
have
come
in
here
and
talked
to
us.
justice
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals,
i
am
talking
about
my
own
opinion.
justice
marshall
i
also
would
not
go
to
one
of
their
meetings,
either,
i
give
you
my
word.
justice
marshall
do
you
assume
that
the
people
who
come
into
this
court
come
in
and
talk
to
us?
justice
marshall
well,
i
don't
understand
your
point.
you
want
to
influence
the
people
who
pass
by
this
building
because
they
will
influence
us?
justice
marshall
is
that
what
you
think?
justice
marshall
because
you
can
save
your
time.
justice
marshall
what
is
a
constitutional
lawyer?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
a
little
different
than
your
case.
justice
marshall
well,
who
paid
your
clients?
justice
marshall
well,
that's
the
difference.
