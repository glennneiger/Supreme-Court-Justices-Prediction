mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
pristine
first
amendment
activity
may
be
absolutely
forbidden
anywhere
on
the
grounds
of
this
court
despite
the
fact
that
such
expression
is
not
basically
incompatible
with
the
normal
uses
of
the
sidewalk
that
surrounds
the
court,
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
manner
of
expression
in
which
my
clients
were
engaged...
that
is,
dissemination
of
printed
matter...
is
allowed
on
the
sidewalks
surrounding
the
court,
which
is
to
say
that
the
washington
post
is
allowed
to
disseminate
its
particular
views
through
its
newspaper.
and
we
submit
that
the
statute
at
issue
is
totally
unnecessary
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
this
court
and
that
congress
has
specifically
addressed
the
concerns
of
the
appearance
of
justice
when
it
promulgated
1507
and
made
a
specific
and
considered
legislative
judgment
which
is
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
of
1507,
that
upon
a
balancing
of
interests
certain
speech
could
be
prohibited;
namely,
speech
which
is
directed
toward
influencing
the
court.
and
we
submit,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
that
1507
amply
protects
the
appearance
of
justice
interests.
moreover,
we
would
point
out
that
section
13k
was
not
passed
by
congress,
at
least
as
reflected
in
the
legislative
history,
based
on
the
assumption
that
some
protection
was
needed
beyond
that
provided
by
1507.
in
fact,
13k
was
enacted
prior
to
promulgation
and
enactment
of
1507.
both
statutes
were
considered
by
the
same
congress,
the
81st
congress,
in
1949.
however,
examination
of
the
legislative
histories,
which
we
detail
in
our
briefs,
reveals
that
13k
was
really
a
housekeeping
measure
that
in
1949
for
some
reason
the
legal
counsel
to
the
district
of
columbia
determined
it
no
longer
possessed
authority
to
commission
special
officers
to
police
this
court.
at
that
time,
the
marshal
of
this
court
went
into
conference
with
the
court
and
consulted
apparently
with
legislative
counsel
to
the
house
of
representatives,
and
the
legislative
scheme
which
was
modeled
after
the
scheme
applying
to
the
capitol
was
enacted.
and
13k
virtually
identically
tracks
the
language
of
the
capitol
statute,
193g,
which
was
invalidated
as
being
spatially
unconstitutional
in
the
jeannette
rankin
case.
now,
mr.
lee
has
pointed
out
that
the
test
articulated
by
this
court
in
grayned
should
be
applied
to
this
case.
and
we
agree
with
that.
and
that
test
is
whether
the
manner
of
expression
is
basically
incompatible
with
the
basic
and
normal
use
of
the
area
in
which
the
expression
takes
place.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
a
lone
leafletter
or
a
lone
sign
holder
who
is
expressing
their
views
on
this
court
in
a
peacable,
silent,
and
orderly
manner
is
not
doing
something
that
is
basically
incompatible
with
the
normal
use
of
the
sidewalk.
now,
the
government
would
have
the
court
hold
that
the
grounds
of
the
court
are
more
akin
to
a
military
base
as
in
greer,
or
a
prison
as
in
adderly,
than
the
public
sidewalk
that
it
actually
is.
as
the
court
i
am
sure
is
aware,
there
is
a
bus
stop
outside
and
tourists
come
to
the
court.
the
sidewalk
is
basically
like
any
other
sidewalk
save
for
the
fact
that
it
borders
this
court.
now,
the
government
also
states
that
this
is
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction.
however,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
believe
pointed
out,
it
is
difficult
to
categorize
this
statute
as
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction,
since
it
totally
forbids
any
expressive
activity
on
the
grounds
of
this
court.
now,
in
heffron
the
court
held
that
the
statute
at
issue
was
the
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction,
pointed
out
that
the
members
of
the
krishna
sect
were
not
totally
forbidden
from
reaching
their
intended
audience
but
rather,
like
all
other
commercial
and
other
enterprises
at
the
state
fair,
were
confined
to
a
particular
area
on
the
state
fair
grounds
and
in
an
area
where
the
public
was
expected
to
pass.
moreover,
the
court
noted
that
members
of
the
krishna
sect
were
free
to
walk
around
the
court...
excuse
me,
the
state
fair
grounds
and
orally
proselytize
their
view
without
restriction.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
we
would
have
no
quarrel
with
that.
obviously,
any
party--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--because
the
statute
is
not,
we
submit,
subject
to
a
limiting
construction,
both
because
of
its
vagueness...
namely,
the
time
to
define--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
we
would
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
that
section
13l--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--yes.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
we
would
certainly
accept
a
limiting
construction
that
would
make
13k
inapplicable
to
the
sidewalk
surrounding
the
court,
but
i
submit
that
the
better
disposition
would
be
to
hold
that
rather
than
this
court
rewriting
the
statute,
that
the
marshal
is
provided
under
13l
with
ample
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
to
preserve
the
decorum
and
dignity
of
this
court.
and
the
better
mechanism
for
dealing
with
the
issues
in
this
case
would
be
to--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--the
basic
reason--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--the
basic
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
i
don't
believe
this
court's
function
is
to
rewrite
statutes.
and
moreover,
the
first
portion--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--yes.
well,
as
i
say,
we
would
have
little
problem
if
the
court
held
that
13k
cannot
be
applied
to
the
sidewalk.
that
achieves
the
result
which--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
i
think
the
first
part
of
this
statute
presents
a
prohibition
against
assemblages
and
processions,
no
matter
the
purpose.
and
judge
mckinnon,
dissenting
in
the
court
below,
when
he
analyzed
the
statute,
also
pointed
out
that
the
first
part
of
the
statute...
and
the
statute
as
the
court
knows,
is
written
in
the
disjunctive...
prohibits
processions
and
assemblages
without
mentioning
the
purpose.
and
then
the
second
aspect
of
the
statute
goes
into
prohibiting
expressive
activity.
and
the
first
part
of
the
statute
is
so
absurdly
vague
and
overbroad
that
we
would
submit
that
that...
if
the
court
was
to
place
the
limiting
construction,
it
should
also
make
clear
that
the
first
part
of
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
overbroad.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
well,
my
client
has
in
the
past
in
fact
been
charged
under
the
first
part
of
that
statute.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
that's
correct.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
i
do,
too.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
well,
in
fact,
judge
oberdorfer,
the
district
court
judge,
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
that
he
did
not
feel
that
our
client's
conduct
was--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--because
the
marshal's
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
it
does--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--no,
but
the--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
my
clients
are
outside
on
the
court
sidewalk,
the
marshal
has
told
them
they
have
to
leave
and--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--no,
but
if
the
marshal
and
the
supreme
court
police
are
free
to
apply
the
statute--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
the
superior
court
placed
a
limiting
construction
on
the
statute,
limiting
it
to
the
intent
to
influence.
and
when
mr.
zywicki--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
i
agree.
in
my
opinion--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
the
statute
is
overbroad,
we
believe,
and
on
its
face
can
be
attacked--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
your
honor,
after
being
threatened
with
arrest
repeatedly,
we
believe
that
our
client
had...
has
standing
under
the
overbreadth
doctrine
to
attack
the
statute
on
its
face
as
applied
to
persons
whose
situations
are
not
before
the
court
as
well
as
to
their
own
situation.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
no,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--the
superior...
obviously,
i
want
to
win
the
case.
but
we
are
pointing
out
that
when
it
comes
to
the
way
the
first
amendment
is
honored
on
the
streets,
it
is
one
thing
for
us
to
say
that
obviously
the
marshal
or
the
police
should
not
apply
the
statute--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
as
i
say--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
we
submit
in
this
case
that
the
court
has
to
address
the
spatial
constitutionality
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
being
administered
against
all
expressive
activity.
and
despite
a
court's
limiting
construction
of
the
statute,
the
superior
court
is
vested
with
jurisdiction
over
criminal
prosecutions
under
this
statute.
when
our
firm
represented
individuals
in
that
court
and
attacked
the
statute's
constitutionality,
the
court
did
place
a
limiting
construction
on
the
statute,
limiting
it
to
influence
picketing.
when
mr.
zywicki
wanted
to
come
to
the
court
again
to
distribute
leaflets
concerning
central
america,
we
told
him
we
did
not
view
that
as
being
within
the
limiting
construction
and
he
could
safely
do
that.
and
when
he
came
to
the
court
and
informed
the
supreme
court
police
that
the
statute
in
his
understanding
had
been
narrowed,
the
police
said,
well,
it
has
not
been
narrowed.
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
way
that
the
first
amendment
is
applied
by
the
police
does
not
provide
the
deference
to
the
first
amendment
that
is
necessary.
and
in
fact,
the
police
are
often
telling
people
that
they
may
not
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights
even
though
technically
they
may
be
incorrect
in
their
interpretation
of
this
statute.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
no.
we
believe
that
the
plaza
area,
beyond
the
plaza
area
a
statute
could
prohibit
all
expressive
activity.
the
government
makes
several
arguments
which
we
feel
are
without
merit.
i
have
already
addressed
the
time,
place,
and
manner
argument.
the
government
also
argues
that
this
is
a
minimal
intrusion
on
individual's
rights.
however,
it
is
not
a
minimal
intrusion
on
the
rights
of
persons
who
wish
to
reach
the
audience
of
persons
who
frequent
this
court.
persons
who
frequent
this
court
tend
to
have
more
of
an
interest
in
justice
issues
than
persons
who
may
frequent
other
areas.
and
an
individual
may
wish
to
reach
those
persons
because
they
have
a
more
sensitive
concern
over
justice
issues,
whether
those
issues
arise
in
central
america
or
whether
they
may
concern
pending
legislation
in
congress;
for
example,
to
limit--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--only
those
of
us
who
are
at
the
lectern,
your
honor.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
not
necessarily
because
they
will--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--no.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
no.
the...
their
desire
to
reach
persons
who
frequent
the
grounds
of
this
court.
we
are
not
attempting,
or
they
are
not
attempting,
to
influence
the
court,
but
they
are
trying
to
reach
people
who
do
frequent
the
court.
for
example,
constitutional
lawyers
who
come
to
this
court
may,
if
they
receive
a
leaflet
about
a
certain
issue,
become
concerned
with
that
issue
and
decide
to
donate
their
time
to
that
particular
issue.
a
person
across
the
street
would
have
no
ability
to
reach
the
constitutional
lawyers
who
come
to
this
court--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--a
constitutional
lawyer,
your
honor,
is
one
who
devotes
his
or
her
practice
to
the
study
of
the
constitution
and
the
prosecution
and
defense
of
constitutional
issues;
for
example,
myself.
[laughter]
most
of
the
cases
that
i
have
handled
deal
with
constitutional
issues
rather
than
business
law
issues
or
tax
issues
or
matters
of
that
sort.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
the
government
has
also
made
an
argument
that
this
statute
is
really
narrower
than
section
1507.
but
we
would
submit
that
this
statute
is,
quite
to
the
contrary,
much
broader
than
section
1507.
the
government
also
points
out
that
to
invalidate
13k
would
force
the
police
to
make
content-based
discrimination
in
determining
whether
or
not
particular
demonstrators
or
leafletters
are
attempting
to
influence
the
court.
however,
1507
reflects
the
congress'
concern
in
striking
the
balance
between
the
rights
of
individuals
to
express
their
views
and
the
rights
of
the
government
to
protect
the
integrity
of
its
processes.
and
really,
that
is
the
basic
interest
at
issue
in
this
case:
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process.
and
in
other
cases
which
have
analyzed
that
interest
in
other
contexts...
for
example,
brown
against
hartledge
and
other
cases...
the
court
has
still
applied
the
traditional
first
amendment
analysis.
and
we
would
submit
that
this
statute
cannot
withstand
application
of
traditional
first
amendment
analyses.
it
is
not
content-neutral.
the
overbreadth
of
the
statute
requires
the
marshal
to
selectively
determine
who
to
enforce
it
against
and
who
not
to
enforce
it
against.
secondly,
the...
there
are
not
other
areas
where
a
leafletter
may
reach
persons
who
frequent
this
court.
therefore,
the
statute--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--well,
there
are...
the
concerns
that
are
applicable
to
jails
and
military
bases
are
concerns
that
are
quite
different
to
a
public
sidewalk
surrounding
a
branch
of
the
national
government.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
except
that,
your
honor,
when
james
madison
introduced
the
first
amendment
to
the
first
assembled
congress,
the
original
language
limited
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
to
the
legislature.
and
congress
rejected
that
view
and
broadened
it
to
include
the
government,
which
does
include
all
three
branches.
now,
1507
protects
the
interest
in
protecting
this
court
against
influence
picketing.
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
1507.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
because
the
due
process
clause,
which
is
also
a
constitutional
guarantee,
affords
parties
the
right
to
an
impartial
tribunal
which
is
not
influenced
by
speech
specifically
directed
toward
issues
that
are
before
the
tribunal.
and
therefore,
due
process
considerations
support
the
sort
of
choice
congress
made.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
no.
as
long
as
the...
the
case
is
not
pending
before
this
court
or
it's
not
directed
toward
an
issue
which
is
pending
in
this
court.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
then
i
believe
1507
applies.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
well,
i...
then
the
statute
could
be
attacked
on
the
grounds
on
which
we
are
submitting,
and
the
prosecution
in
that
case
would
have
chosen
the
wrong
statute
in
which
to
prosecute
the
individual.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
by
the
court,
in
conclusion
we
would
simply
submit
that
this
statute
was
not
based
on
considered
judgments
of
congress
that
the
first
amendment
may
be
absolutely
rendered
inapplicable
to
this
court;
rather,
the
statute
was
passed
along
with
the
other
scheme
of
which
13k
is
a
part
to
generally
protect
this
court.
the
other
interests
which
are
advanced
by
the
government...
decorum
and
dignity...
are
protected
by
the
other
aspects
of
the
statute
which
are
not
being
attacked:
the
statutes
which
forbid
the
makings
of
orations,
engaging
in
disruptive
or
disorderly
conduct,
and
the
authority
that
the
marshal
has
under
13l
to
promulgate
whatever
regulations
may
be
reasonable
to
assure
the
decorum
and
dignity
of
this
court.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
yes,
because--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--it
is
a
device,
the
vending
machine
is
a
device
designed
or
adapted
to
bring
into
public
notice
an
organization;
namely,
the
washington
post.
and
every
day
when
the
person
from
the
post
comes
and
puts
in
their
newspaper,
as
the
government
conceded
in
the
district
court,
that
statute
is
being
violated.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
that
is
another
problem.
[laughter]
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
your
honor,
i
did
not
write
this
statute.
but
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute
prohibit
any
device
designed
or
adapted
to
bring
into
notice
any
organization,
movement,
or
party.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
washington
post
daily
is
allowed
to
distribute
through
the
printed
word
its
views--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--if...
exactly.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
well--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--nobody.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
also--
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
--no.
[laughter]
it
is
a
different
theory,
the
theory
being
that
once
the
forum
is
open
to
a
particular
medium
of
expression,
then
the
government
is
hard-pressed
to
justify
closing
it
to
the
same
medium
of
expression.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
yes.
that
is
that
the...
whoever
has
allowed
dissemination
through
printed
matter
to
the
post
and
also
met
forum
but
is
depriving
my
clients
of
their
rights.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
well,
the
post
itself,
because
of
the
ambiguity
of
the
term
"device",
the
post
itself
may
be
a
device
which
with
its
banner
contains
a
reference
to
the
organization
of
the
washington
post.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
yes.
mr.
sebastian
k.d.
graber
yes.
the
facts
are
that
my
clients
were
very
near
the
vending
machines
and
the
curb
line
of
the
street.
