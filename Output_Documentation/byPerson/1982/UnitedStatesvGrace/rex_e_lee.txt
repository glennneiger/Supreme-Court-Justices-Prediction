mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
constitutionality
of
40
u.s.c.
section
13k
which
prohibits
picketing,
leafletting,
and
demonstrating
in
the
supreme
court
building
and
on
its
grounds.
a
related
statutory
section,
13p
defines
the
supreme
court
grounds
as
extending
to
the
curb
of
each
of
the
four
streets
enclosing
the
block
on
which
the
building
is
located.
the
appellees,
zywicki
and
grace,
after
making
several
attempts
between
may
of
1978
and
march
of
1980
to
distribute
leaflets
or
demonstrate
with
a
sign
on
the
supreme
court
grounds,
and
on
each
occasion
being
informed
by
supreme
court
police
officers
that
the
conduct
was
prohibited,
brought
this
action
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
section
13k's
ban
is
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
dismissed
their
action,
and
the
court
of
appeals
by
a
two-to-one
decision
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
section
13k
is
a
content-neutral
congressional
restriction
on
a
place
within
which
one
manner
of
first
amendment
activity,
demonstrating
and
leafletting,
may
occur.
this
court
made
it
clear
in
heffron
versus
krishna
consciousness
that
time,
place,
or
manner
restrictions
have
been
upheld
providing
three
criteria
are
satisfied.
they
are:
first,
that
it
must
be
content-neutral;
second,
that
it
must
serve
a
significant
governmental
interest;
and
third,
that
it
leaves
open
ample
alternative
channels
for
communication.
this
statute
clearly
applies
to
all
demonstrating
and
leafletting
activity
without
regard
to
content.
the
remaining
issues
therefore
concern
the
significance
of
the
governmental
interests
and
the
adequacy
of
alternative
channels
for
communication.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
clearly,
where
it
leaves
open,
if
that
is
the
reason
for
the
alternative...
adequacy
of
the
alternative
channels
inquiry.
just
as
in
greer
versus
spock,
there
was
no
opportunity
for
political
advertising
or
political
activity
within
the
military,
for
instance.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it...
it
may
be...
it
may
be
that
in
addition.
but
the
no-public-forum
concept
is
the
notion
that
there
are
certain
kinds
of
places
where
certain
kinds
of
activity
are
not
to
be
permitted.
and
this
is
not
a
restriction
on
all
types
of
first
amendment
expression.
it
is
a
restriction
on
one
type
of
expression;
namely,
picketing,
leafletting
and
demonstrating
within
an
identified
place,
the
same
as
you
had
in
heffron
and
in
greer
versus
spock
and
in
grayned
versus
city
of
rockford.
so
that
what
is
brought
into
place
so
long
as
it
is
content-neutral
is
the
consideration
of
the
comparative
interest
of
the
government
on
the
one
hand
in
identifying
a
certain
limited
place
in
which
one
manner
of
restriction
is
to
be
upheld,
and
also
the
alternative
means
of
communication.
with
regard
to
the
congressional
objective,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
the
government
does
have
a
substantial
interest
in
restricting
picketing
and
other
forms
of
expression
in
or
near
courthouses,
but
concluded
that
these
legitimate
concerns
are
fully
addressed
by
another
statute,
18
u.s.c.
section
1507,
which
prohibits
picketing
or
parading
in
or
near
any
federal
courthouse
with
the
intent
of
influencing
a
judge,
juror,
witness,
or
court
officer.
the
court
of
appeals
reasoning
that
section
13k
is
outside
congress'
constitutional
authority
because
its
purposes
are
adequately
accomplished
by
another
statute
is
flawed
in
several
respects.
the
first
is
that
it
is
a
non
sequitur.
i
know
of
no
authority,
and
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
suggested
none,
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
constitution
prohibits
congress
from
enacting
two
separate
statutes
that
address
the
same
problem
in
overlapping
ways.
indeed,
that
proposition
is
squarely
rejected
by
this
court's
holding
in
o'brien,
united
states
versus
o'brien,
that
the
existence
of
a
statute
prohibiting
non-possession
of
a
draft
card
did
not
interdict
an
overlapping
statute
prohibiting
mutilation.
second,
the
court
of
appeals
premise
is
in
fact
incorrect.
it
is
true
that
section
1507
overlaps
one
of
section
13k's
purposes;
namely,
attempts
to
influence
the
courts'
decisions.
but
section
13k
also
reaches
another
congressional
objective
that
is
not
covered
by
section
1507
but
is
equally
legitimate;
that
is,
protection
against
the
appearance
of
impropriety,
against
the
inference
that
the
processes
of
the
nation's
highest
court
are
or
may
be
influenced
by
demonstrators
or
leafletters.
section
13k
stands
as
a
congressional
assurance
to
the
people
of
this
nation--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
is
just--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
inference
against
which
congress
may
legitimately
protect
is
the
inference
that
would
be
drawn
by
the
people
that
because
of
the
mere
existence
of
picketers
on
the
supreme
court
grounds,
that
the
court's
decisions
are
in
fact
influenced
by
that
kind
of
process.
it--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--what
congress
has
said
is
that
picketing
and
demonstrating
activity
within
the
narrow
space
of
the
supreme
court
block
is
incompatible
with
the
traditional
purposes
for
which
this
court
is
to
be
used.
among
the
considerations
that
congress
could
properly
have
taken
into...
into
account
were
the
same
consideration
that
this
court
relied
upon
in
cox
versus
louisiana,
and
i
am
quoting,
that
"a
state
may
protect
against
the
possibility
of
a
conclusion
by
the
public
that
the
judge's
action
was,
in
part,
a
product
of
intimidation
and
did
not
flow
only
from
the
fair
and
orderly
working
of
the
judicial
process.
"
significant
in
that
respect,
justice
marshall,
in
our
view,
is
the
distinction
between
the
holding
in
cox
and
that
in
edwards
versus
south
carolina.
those
two
cases
were
handed
down
within
just
a
couple
of
years
of
each
other.
they
involved
remarkably
similar
demonstration-type
activities,
one
of
which
was
held
constitutionally
protected
and
the
other
not.
there
are
only
two
significant
differences
so
far
as
i
am
aware.
one
is
the
difference
between
the
places
where
the
two
demonstrations
occurred.
the
state
capitol
grounds
in
edwards
and
the
courthouse
grounds
in
cox.
demonstrations
on
the
grounds
of
an
elected
legislative
body
are
not
only
compatible
with
the
legislative
function,
they
reflect
the
fact
that
in
our
representative
system
of
government
the
pressure
of
popular
opinion
is
properly
brought
to
bear
on
legislative
policy
makers.
by
contrast,
as
this
court
observed
in
cox,
government
may
protect
not
only
against
such
pressure
in
fact
being
brought
against
the
courts,
it
may
also
protect...
and
this
is
a
quote
from
this
court's
opinion
in
that
case...
"the
judicial
process
from
being
misjudged
in
the
minds
of
the
public.
"
and
as
this
court
said
just
last
term
in
clements
versus
fashing,
that
whereas
a
legislator
will
vote
with
due
regard
for
constituent
views,
it
is
a
serious
accusation
that
a
judge
made
a
politically
motivated
decision.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
precisely
my
point,
justice
stevens.
it
is
the
distinction
between
activity
which
is
directed
toward
the
court
and
its
activities,
which
wouldn't--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
but
it
could
affect
the
appearance,
because
permitting
the
leafletter
and
the
demonstrator,
the
sign
carrier
and
the
leaflet
distributor
on
the
grounds
of
the
court--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--whether
it
is
about
south
american
politics
or
whatever,
the
mere
presence
on
the
grounds
of
that
person
engaging
in
that
kind
of
activity
leads
to
a
possible
inference
that
that
kind
of
activity
may
influence
the
court's
decisions,
because
passersby,
observers
of
that
activity,
may
very
well
not
read
what
is
in
fact
on
the
leaflet
and
only
draw
the
inference
that
leafletting
is
in
fact
occurring
and
may
have
an
influence
on
the
court's
decision,
regardless
of
the
content.
it's
the
speech-plus
kind
of
notion
that...
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
contexts.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
matter
of
linedrawing
is
a
difficult
one.
and
it
could
extend
across
the
street.
and
your
point,
of
course,
illustrates
just
how
narrow
really
is
the
disagreement
between
the
government
and
our
opponents,
because
everyone
agrees,
i
take
it...
the
court
of
appeals,
the
appellees,
and
the
amicus...
that
congress
could
properly
prohibit
any
kind
of
leafletting
or
other
activity
within
the
building
itself.
so
that
the
only
spatial
issue
that
we're
talking
about
in
the
protection
of
this
kind
of
interest
is
whether
you
can
extend
it,
whether
congress
can
extend
it,
from
the
edge
of
the
building
to
the
edge
of
the
curb.
now,
it
could,
of
course,
be
extended
across
the
street,
which
would
make
it...
and
in
my
opinion,
that
would
also
be
constitutional...
but
those
kinds
of
lines
are
the
kinds
of
lines
that
are
traditionally
drawn
by
legislatures
and
they
reflect
the
kind
of
policy
kind
of
judgment
that
we
have
traditionally
entrusted
to
the
legislatures.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
have
some
question
of
whether--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
i
have
some
question
whether
the
wearing
of
a
campaign
button
would
actually
come
within
the
strictures
of
the
statute
itself.
if
it
simply
happens
to
be
something
that
is
a
matter
of
the
individual's
apparel
and
is
not
done
in
a
demonstrating
kind
of
fashion,
then
it
might
not
come
within
the...
within
the...
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
and
i
think
that
that
one,
justice
o'connor,
for
reasons
that...
i
think
that
that
one
has
been
laid
to
rest
by
this
court's
decisions
over
a
period
of
time
from
broderick
against
oklahoma
and
culminating
with
last
term's
decision
in
new
york
versus
ferber.
certainly,
the
disparity
between
the
clearly
prohibitable
activity
on
the
one
hand
and
the
arguably
protected
activity
on
the
other
in
this
case
is
much
lesser
than
it
was
in
new
york
versus
ferber.
and
as
i
read
that
case,
this
court
said
in
very
clear
terms
that
what
you
take
into
account
is
the
comparison
between
the
legitimate
scope,
the
legitimate
sweep
of
the
statute,
and
the
possible
impermissible
applications.
and
that
so
long
as
the
impermissible
is
not
substantial,
then
you
do
not
reach
the
constitutionality
of
a
hypothetical
case
in
the
process
of
deciding
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
not,
justice
marshall.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
that
is
in
its
very
nature
the
kind
of
judgment
that
we
entrust
to
legislatures
for
several
reasons
as
a
matter
of
linedrawing.
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
a
judicial
judgment.
but
as
this
court
said
initially
in
grayned
versus
city
of
rockford,
the
question
is
whether
the
particular
type
of
expression
is
compatible
with
the
purpose
of
the
particular
place
in
which
it
occurs
at
a
particular
time.
the
inquiry
then
is
whether
the
expression
activity
is
or
is
not
compatible
with
the
purpose
of
the
particular
place.
now,
how
and
by
whom
is
this
issue
of
compatibility
to
be
resolved?
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
a
judicial
decision
because
it
is
an
issue
on
which
the
constitutional
holding
turns.
but
it
is,
i
think,
significant
in
this
respect,
that
the
restriction
in
the
cox
case,
in
grayned,
and
in
greer,
all
represented
specific
particularized
determinations
by
the
authorized
policy
makers
concerning
that
issue
of
compatibility,
concerning
the
compatibility
of
demonstrations
with
the
particular
purposes
for
which
a
particular
place
was
intended.
the
statute
in
cox,
for
example,
dealt
specifically
with
picketing
near
a
courthouse.
that
was
the
legislative
determination
that
was
involved
in
that
case.
the
anti-noise
ordinance
in
grayned
prohibited
disruptive
noise
on
the
school
ground.
and
the
regulation
in
greer
pertained
to
one
particular
military
reservation.
now,
compare
that
with
edwards
versus
south
carolina.
the
law
allegedly
violated
in
edwards
versus
south
carolina
was
a
breach
of
the
peace
statute
which
contained
no
legislative
judgment
concerning
whether
demonstrations
were
compatible
with
the
grounds
surrounding
a
legislature.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
legislative
determination
is
conclusive,
because
it
is
not.
but
neither
is
it
irrelevant.
as
this
court
observed
in
grayned,
a
precise
statute
gives
this
court
the
assurance
that
the
legislature
has
focused
on
the
first
amendment
interests
and
has
determined
that
other
governmental
policies
compel
regulation.
the
reason
was
best
explained,
perhaps,
by
professor
kalven,
that
in
the
difficult
balancing
processes
that
these
cases
force
upon
the
court,
it
has
the
benefit
of
a
council
of
a
deliberate,
specific,
and
relevant
legislative
judgment.
the
legislative
judgment
underlying
section
13k
is
likewise
deliberate,
specific,
and
relevant,
and
it
is
that
picketing,
demonstrating,
and
leafletting
on
the
supreme
court
grounds
are
incompatible
with
the
use
to
which
that
particular
area
should
be
put;
specifically,
the
prevention
of
the
public
perception
of
impropriety
in
the
judicial
process.
let
me
say
just
a
word
about
the
adequacy
of
alternative
channels
for
communication.
the
impact
of
this
statute
on
the
appellees'
legitimate
first
amendment
interests
is
really
quite
minimal.
in
greer
versus
spock
the
court
upheld
a
ban
on
partisan
political
speeches
and
demonstrations
within
a
military
reservation,
observing
that
the
people
at
fort
dix
could
attend
political
rallies
out
of
uniform
and
off
base.
there
were
other
means
for
the
expression
of
that
particular
kind
of
political
communication.
and
similarly,
the
heffron
opinion
stressed
alternative
means
and
places
for
the
practice
of
sancratan,
which
was
the
religious
objective
in
that
case.
these
alternatives
did
not
represent
the
demonstrators'
first
choices,
but
in
each
of
those
cases
the
place
restriction
was
upheld
and
in
each
the
disparity
between
the
demonstrators'
first
choice
and
the
alternative
was,
if
anything,
greater
than
in
this
case.
all
that
section
13k
requires
is
that
the
demonstrators
move
not
off
the...
off
base
and
out
of
uniform,
many
miles
away,
but
20
feet
farther
away,
clearly
a
lesser
spatial
sacrifice
than
was
involved
either
in
greer
or
heffron.
and
this
illustrates--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
even
the
court
of
appeals
and--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
of
course.
it...
this
statute
has
nothing
to
do
with
voluntary
conversations
that
members
of
the
court
might
choose
to
have
with
any
person.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
understand.
the
narrowness
of
the
disagreement
between
our
position
and
that
of
the
appellees
demonstrates
that
the
final
matter
is
really
one
of
linedrawing,
that
it
is
the
kind
of
linedrawing
that
lies
within
the
congressional
objective,
and
that
if
in
the
interest
of
preserving
the
appearance
of
military
propriety,
which
was
one
of
the
objectives
that
was
upheld
in
greer
versus
spock,
is
proper,
then
certainly
a
congressional
objective
should
be
similarly
upheld.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
only
this,
justice
stevens...
i
guess
two
things.
one
is,
we
know
of
no
reason
why
any
member
of
the
court
should
be
recused.
in
our
view,
there
is
no
closer
interest
of
any
member
of
the
court
that
is
involved
in
this
case
than
would
be
involved
in
a
case
concerning
the
court's
jurisdiction,
the
kind
of
issue
that
the
court
is
called
upon
to
pass
on
with
some
frequency;
and
secondly,
that
the
strong
congressional
policy
reflected
in
28
u.s.c.
section
1252,
that
the
constitutionality
of
congressional
statutes
be
decided
by
this
court
should
counsel
against
disqualification.
and
for
that
reason,
we
know
of
no
reason
that
any
member
of
the
court
should
be
disqualified.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
with
regard
to
the
most
recent
exchange
between
mr.
graber
and
the
court,
i
think
that
what
that
illustrates
is
the
wisdom
of
two
messages
that
i
see
emanating
from
this
court's
opinion
in
new
york
versus
ferber
that
came
down
last
term.
and
those
two
messages
are
that
where
you
have
a
statute
that
is
attacked
as
being
either
overbroad
or
vague,
that
the
first
thing
you
look
for
is
to
see
if
there
isn't
some
way
that
a
common-sense
narrowing
interpretation
of
the
statute
can't
save
its
constitutionality.
that
is
particularly
appropriate
in
this
instance,
because
unlike
the
statute
in
broderick
and
in
new
york,
this
is
a
congressional
statute,
and
therefore
the
interpretative
stewardship
lies
within
this
court
itself.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
insofar
as
ms.
grace
and
her
sign
are
concerned,
i
think
she
did.
and
i
think
that
one
is
fairly
clear.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
device.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
movement,
i
would
say,
the
party
or
the
movement
is
the
movement
that
her
papers--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--first
amendment.
the
movement
is
the
movement
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
first
amendment
movement.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
her
individual
view,
her
individual
view,
which
may
have
been
shared
by
other
people,
that
this
court
is
not...
is
not
interpreting
in
the
proper
way
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
very
possible.
[laughter]
nevertheless,
it
does
come
within
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--let
me
say
two
things.
one
is
that
i
think
we
should
give
at
least
something
that
approaches
the
deference
to
administrative
agencies
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
interpreting
the
statutes,
the
judgment,
the
interpretation
that
is
given
to
it
by
the
marshal.
certainly,
it's
not
binding,
but
neither
is
it...
is
it
totally
irrelevant.
and
the
marshal
has
interpreted
this
statute
as
prohibiting
generally
picketing-type
activity.
and
the
picketing-type
activity
certainly
does
include
the
carrying
of
a
sign.
the
second
message
that
comes
out
of
this
court's
holding
in
new
york
versus
ferber
is
that
because
you
can
find
one
isolated
element
of
unconstitutionality,
that
you
don't
throw
out
the...
the
entire
statute.
therefore,
both
the
construction
alternative
and
also
the
on-its-face
approach
as
opposed
to
the...
or
excuse
me,
the
as-applied
approach
as
opposed
to
the
on-its-face
approach
are
two
messages
that
come
clearly
from
this
court's
decision
of
last
year
in
new
york
versus
ferber.
now,
finally,
as
to
whether
this
really
is
just
a
place
restriction,
mr.
graber
expresses
the
view
that
it
totally
forbids
expressive
activity.
and
that
clearly
is
his
view.
that
is
the
way
that
he
would
interpret
the
statute,
because
of
his
example
including
everything
from
the
washington
post
to
the
pepsi
cola
truck.
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
it
is
not
the
way
the
marshal
has
interpreted
it,
and
this
court's
opinions
clearly
teach
that
you
don't
interpret
the
statute
in
such
a
way
that
is
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
purpose
of
interpretation
is
to
save
rather
than
to
condemn.
as
a
statute
that
prohibits
picketing-type
activities,
demonstration
kinds
of
activities,
it
is
a
statute
that
falls
squarely
within
the
ambit
of
what
this
court
has
held
in
greer
versus
spock,
heffron,
and
the
other
cases.
it
forbids
only
one
kind
of
expressive
activity;
namely,
the
picket
sign,
the
leafletting,
the
parading.
just
as
the
court
said,
one
of
the
basics
for
the
court's
holding
in
greer
versus
spock
was
that
the
kind
of
political
activity
that
was
involved
in
that
case
might
create,
and
i
am
quoting,
"the
appearance
that
the
military
was
acting
as
a
handmaiden
for
partisan
political
causes
or
candidates.
"
if
the
preservation
of
military
appearances
justifies
a
place
limitation
on
demonstrations,
then
we
submit
that
a
fortiori
a
congressional
judgment
affecting
a
much
smaller
place
in
the
interest
of
preserving
public
confidence
in
the
judiciary
should
also
be
upheld.
and
now,
finally,
aside
from
all
other
considerations,
it
should
lie
within
the
legitimate
authority
of
congress
to
identify
a
limited
number
of
places
which
serve
as
symbols
of
certain
congressionally
determined
national
values.
and
where
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
those
symbolic
purposes,
congress
may
further
determine
that
those
few
places
are
to
enjoy
a
special
environment
free
of
the
picketer
and
free
of
his
signs.
and
if
congress
wants
to
take
special
steps
to
prevent
the
grounds
of
this
court
from
becoming
another
hyde
park
or
even
a
lafayette
park,
in
symbolism
of
the
dignity
and
decorum
and
total
judicial
values
that
are
represented
by
this
court,
not
only
as
representative
of
its
own
work
but
also
the
work
of
the
entire
federal
judiciary,
then
that,
we
submit,
lies
within
the
legitimate
prerogative
of
congress
so
long
as
it
is
content-neutral,
and
this
one
clearly
is,
and
so
long
as
there
are
adequate
alternative
channels
for
communication,
and
clearly
there
are.
for
this
reason,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
