justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
how
can
that
interest
justify
prohibiting
the
leafletting
in
this
case
involving
some
central
american
political
situation?
justice
stevens
but
that
leafletting
couldn't
even
affect
the
appearance,
which
is
your
present
justification,
i
understand.
justice
stevens
just
confine
it
to
the
leafletter
about
south
american
politics,
where
you
have
no
cases--
justice
stevens
--well,
if
that's
a
sufficient
justification,
i
suppose
the
statute
could
extend
across
the
street,
too.
justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
they
haven't
had
to
raise
it
in
this
case.
you're
talking
about
within
the
building,
but
is
it
in
your
mind
perfectly
clear
that
the
statute
could
prohibit
the
wearing
of
a
campaign
button
within
the
building,
for
example?
justice
stevens
and
that
statute
may
do
that.
justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general--
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
question--
justice
stevens
--on
this
appearance
point?
in
your
jurisdictional
statement
you
pointed
out
that
the
disqualification
statute
provides
that
we
should
not
sit
in
a
case
in
which
our
impartiality
might
reasonably
be
questioned.
and
i
wonder...
and
the
other
side
has
suggested
that
that
statute
might
apply
to
at
least
some
members
of
the
court...
i
wonder
if
you
have
anything
further
to
say
on
that
subject
other
than
what
you
have
said
on
it.
justice
stevens
did
you...
did
you
take
the
position
in
the
lower
court
that
you
didn't
even
violate
the
statute?
justice
stevens
well,
then
how
do
we
even
get
to
a
constitutional
question?
justice
stevens
are
we
bound
by
the
marshal?
justice
stevens
because
if
it's
perfectly
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
your
clients
didn't
violate
it,
why
do
we
have
to
have
a
major
constitutional
case
out
of
a
very
petty
dispute?
justice
stevens
you
then
went
into
a
district
court
and
said
he
shouldn't
do
this,
and
the
judge
could
have
said,
you're
absolutely
right,
but
he
didn't
have
to
decide
any
constitutional
question,
did
he?
justice
stevens
well,
they're
not
if
they
obey
the
district
court
order
that
tells
them
not
to.
justice
stevens
no,
but
i
am
leaving
out
the
intent
to
influence.
i
don't
see
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
how
your
client
violated
either
of
the
two
clauses.
you
weren't
engaged
in
a
parade;
and
you
didn't
use
a
flag,
banner,
or
device
designed
to
bring
into
public
notice
any
party,
organization,
or
movement.
justice
stevens
so
how
do
we
get
to
any
constitutional
question?
justice
stevens
well,
but
can
some
stranger
come
in
and
just
say,
i
want
to
have
a
statute
held
unconstitutional
even
though
i
didn't
violate
it
and
there's
no
basis
for
prosecuting
me
under
it?
justice
stevens
or
statutory
construction
issues?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
you
gave
an
example
earlier
in
your
presentation
about
the
sale
of
the
washington
post
within
the
area
covered
by
the
statute.
you
don't
contend
that
violates
the
statute,
do
you?
justice
stevens
what
part
of
the
statute
does
that
violate?
justice
stevens
this
is
in
a
very
different
theory
of
why
the
post
would
violate
the
statute
now.
you're
saying...
you're
abandoning
your
suggestion
just
because
the
sign
that
says
"washington
post"
on
the
vending
machine,
that
doesn't...
that's
really
pretty
far
out.
and
that
would
make
the
sign,
i
suppose,
on
the
men's
room
violate
the
statute.
justice
stevens
well,
but
i
am
asking
you
why,
why
it
violates
the
statute.
i
am
not
asking
about
the
constitutional
theory
now.
and
you
have
another
theory
on
the
post
other
than
the
fact
they
have
their
sign
on
the
vending
machine?
justice
stevens
well,
but
forget
your
client
for
a
moment.
how
does
the
post
violate
the
language
of
this
statute
by
being
sold
within
the
building
or
wherever
it
is
sold?
justice
stevens
okay.
i
understand.
mr.
graber,
is
it
agreed
by
both
sides
that
your
clients
were
on
the
public
sidewalk
and
not
any
closer
to
the
grounds
or
building--
justice
stevens
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
think
these
people
violated
the
statute?
justice
stevens
and
what
is
the
party,
organization,
or
movement?
justice
stevens
there
is
a
device,
but
what
did
it...
was
it
apt...
did
it
bring
into
public
notice
any
party,
organization,
or
movement?
and
with
what
party,
organization,
or
movement
did
that
sign
bring
into
notice?
justice
stevens
her
sign
just
quoted
the
first
amendment.
justice
stevens
the
first
amendment
movement.
justice
stevens
that's
subversive.
[laughter]
and
that's
a
narrow
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
maybe
she
was
applauding
our
interpretations.
justice
stevens
it's
certainly
difficult
for
me
to
identify
the
party,
organization,
or
movement
that
that
sign...
that
that
sign
brings
into
public
notice.
