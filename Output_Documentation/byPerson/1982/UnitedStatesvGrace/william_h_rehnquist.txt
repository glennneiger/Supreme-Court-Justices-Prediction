justice
rehnquist
generally,
do
you
think
that
a
regulation
which
in
effect
says
no
time,
no
place,
no
manner
can
really
be
called
a
time,
place,
and
manner
regulation?
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
for
one
wouldn't
think
of
greer
versus
spock
as
a
time,
place,
and
manner
restriction.
i
think
of
it
as
a
no-public-forum
case.
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
jail
case,
mr.
graber?
i
suppose
people
who
are
interested
in
prison
conditions
would
much
prefer
to
present
their
message
right
at
the
prison
or
right
at
the
jail.
and
yet
adderly
and
jones
certainly
suggest
that
even
though
that's
your
message,
you
have
simply
got
to
find
somewhere
else
to
do
it.
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
this
isn't
just
a
branch
of
the
national
government.
it's
the
judicial
branch
which
not
only,
in
hamilton's
words,
was
the
least
dangerous
branch
but
is
also
thought
to
be
the
one
that
should
be
least
influenced
by
public
opinion.
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you
think...
if
you
read
the
petition
for
grievance
provision
the
way
we
do,
why...
why
would
you
concede
that
influence
picketing,
is
it
all
wrong
or
can
it
be
limited
at
all
by
congress?
if
people
are
petitioning
for
redress
of
grievances
when
they
go
before
a
courthouse
where
someone
is
being
tried
and
say,
we
want
this
guy
convicted
whatever
the
evidence
is,
why
don't
you
call
that
a
petition
for
redress
of
grievances?
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
it's
your
position
that
you
can
picket
or
leaflet
or
demonstrate
on
the
sidewalk,
at
least
around
the
court,
about
an
injustice
in
central
america
but
that
you
couldn't
complain
about
anything
about
justice
in
this
country?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
sidewalk
around
the
court
and
in
issue
that
is
pending
in
this
court?
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
this
statute,
someone
picked
up
under
this
statute
and
charged
under
this
statute?
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
pepsi
cola
delivery
truck
at
the
back?
[laughter]
justice
rehnquist
you
can't
be
serious.
[laughter]
justice
rehnquist
oh,
but
a
court
construing
any
statute
under...
in
any
jurisdiction
tries
to
construe
it
with
some
notion
as
to
what
the
evils
the
legislature
intended
and
what
a
common-sense
construction
of
the
statute
would
result
in.
there
may
be
close
cases
under
the
language,
but
i
can't
believe
that
the
pepsi
cola
truck
or
the
washington
post
circulation
man
really
are
violating
the
statute.
justice
rehnquist
if
you
pay
for
it.
justice
rehnquist
--than
that?
