justice
white
mr.
graber,
would
you
be
here
if
the
statute
just
forbad
what
it
forbids
now
on
the...
inside
the
building
or
on
the
steps?
what
if
it
permitted...
treated
the
sidewalks
like
any
other
public
sidewalk?
justice
white
well,
why
should
the
statute
be
held
unconstitutional
on
its
face
then?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what...
this
is
a
federal
statute,
and
it's
a
federal
court.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
state
statute,
and
in
other
cases
where
a...
it
is
claimed
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
it's
overbroad,
we
have
simply
said,
well,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
insofar
as,
but
otherwise
constitutional,
which
is...
the
statute
is
then
no
longer
overbroad.
justice
white
your
client
would
win
his
case.
justice
white
but
the
statute
wouldn't
be...
wouldn't
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
white
why
do
you
think
that's
a
better...
better
mechanism
than
to...
if
congress
could
just
repass
the
statute
and
it's
the
very
same
statute
but
limit
it
to
the
steps
and
the
inside
of
the
building,
why
should
we
send
it
back
to
congress
and
make
them
do
that?
justice
white
because
all...
all
they'd
do
is
say...
say
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
it
might
be
applied
to
the
sidewalks.
justice
white
well,
this
court,
after
all,
the
overbreadth
doctrine
is
an
invention
of
this
court.
normally,
you
take...
you
declare
statutes
unconstitutional
as
applied.
and
that's
normally
what
you
do.
and
it's...
it's
just
a
judicial
invention
to
strike
a
statute
down
on
its
face
for
overbreadth,
isn't
it?
justice
white
but
you
want
more
than
that.
justice
white
may
i
ask,
mr.
graber,
what
standing
do
you
have
to
quarrel
with
the
first
part
of
the
statute?
your
client
didn't
violate
that,
did
he?
justice
white
but
none
of
the
incidents
in
the
record
would
violate
the
first
part
of
the
statute.
justice
white
in
fact,
i
wonder
if
they
violate
the
second
part
of
the
statute.
justice
white
well,
you
really
just
want
to
win
your
case,
don't
you?
justice
white
what
if
you
had
made
two
arguments,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
and
the
court,
you
say,
this
statute
doesn't...
didn't
apply
to
this
conduct
whatsoever.
and
secondly,
if
it
does,
it's
unconstitutional.
and
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said,
well,
or
the
lower
courts
had
held,
well,
we
know
that
we
can
construe
the
statute
to...
it
should
be
construed
to
exclude
this
conduct,
but
we
just
would
rather
reach
the
overbreadth
argument?
justice
white
now,
what...
normally,
you
don't
reach
constitutional
questions
if
you
don't
have
to,
as
justice
stevens
indicates.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
third
case
is
united
states
against
grace
which
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
this
case
began
when
the
two
appellees
appeared
on
the
public
sidewalk
in
front
of
this
building,
one
carrying
a
picket
sign
and
the
other
distributing
leaflets.
they
were
then
threatened
with
the
rest
of
the
authority
being
a
federal
statute
which
forbids
the
kind
of
conduct
that
appellees
were
engaged
in
anywhere
on
the
supreme
court
grounds
which
are
expressly
defined
as
including
the
public
sidewalks
surrounding
the
building.
the
appellees
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies,
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
the
statute
was
invalid
on
its
face
as
an
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
we
affirmed,
but
on
the
narrower
ground
that
--
that
the
statute
is
invalid
under
the
first
amendment
as
applied
to
a
conduct
occurring
on
the
public
sidewalks
which
historically
and
traditionally
are
public
forums
for
expressive
activity.
otherwise,
the
judgment
is
vacated.
justice
marshall
and
justice
stevens
have
each
filed
opinions
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
