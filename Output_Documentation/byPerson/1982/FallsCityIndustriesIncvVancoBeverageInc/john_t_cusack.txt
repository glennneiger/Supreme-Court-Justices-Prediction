mr.
john
t.
cusack
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
questions
for
the
court.
the
first
is
was
the
district
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
in
affirming
the
district
court
clearly
erroneous
in
making
two
factual
findings
which
are
key
to
this
case.
the
first
question
if
whether
falls
city
sustained
its
burden...
and
its
burden
of
showing
that
its
persisent
and
substantial,
from
10
to
29
percent
price
discrimination
throughout
the
entire
period
resulted
from
its
good
faith
attempt
to
meet
competition.
the
second
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
vanco
established
competitive
injury
when
it
showed
it
lost
volume
and
profits,
even
in
light
of
the
fact
that
it
absorbed
substantial
price
increases
by
falls
city,
and
it
lost
these
profits
and
lost
these
sales
due
to
falls
city's
persistent
and
substantial
price
discrimination.
in
regard
to
the
meeting
competition
question,
one,
falls
city
never
competed
on
the
basis
of
price.
and
this
was
found
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
judge
holder
said
that
falls
city
"was
not
meeting
competition."
"its
action
was
to
get
a
higher
price
in
indiana
than
in
kentucky."
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
section
2(b)
"is
designed
to
allow
a
seller
to
defend
against
genuine
price
competition."
and
that
the
district
court
found
that
falls
city
in
setting
its
indiana
price
was
simply
taking
advantage
of
its
competitor's
policies
of
charging
higher
prices
in
indiana
than
in
kentucky
and
other
states.
and
i've
got
to
say
it
to
this
court,
the
testimony
of
mr.
tate
was
that
in
the
thirteen
states
where
they
sold
beer,
the
price
was
higher
in
indiana
than
anywhere
else,
and
he
guessed
that
all
brewers
charged
a
higher
price
in
indiana
than
somewhere
else.
and
i
am
appalled
that
the
amicus
could
take
the
side
of
falls
city
under
these
circumstances.
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
are
not
clearly
erroneous
and
"there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
falls
city
first
adopted
a
nondiscriminatory
pricing
structure
and
then
reduced
its
prices
when
necessary
to
defend
against
competition."
falls
city
admitted
at
trial
and
also
in
the
deposition
of
mr.
tate
which
took
place
a
year
before
when
he
was
asked
by
judge
holder
the
following
question,
and
the
focus
was
on
the
higher
indiana
price.
the
courts:
"well,
the
price
is
fob
at
your
dock."
"why
is
the
indiana
price
higher
than
kentucky
under
the
policy
of
your
company?"
mr.
tate:
"well,
because
we
followed
the
leaders,
the
pricing
of
the
leaders
of
the
beers
in
indiana
as
far
as
their
dock
prices
were
concerned."
falls
city
throughout
the
period
never
decreased
its
prices
in
indiana,
but
throughout
raised
its
prices
continuously
in
both
indiana
and
kentucky.
and,
in
fact,
on
six
separate
occasions
by
letters
dated
the
same
dates
and
for
price
increases
effective
the
same
exact
dates
they
sent
out
price
increase
letters
to
both
customers
in
indiana
and
kentucky.
how
is
that
an
evidence
of
good
faith?
as
an
example:
price
increase
letter
dated
january
20,
1977,
effective
january
1,
1977.
the
letters
are
identical
except
one
letter
says
kentucky,
the
other
says
indiana,
and
the
prices
are
higher.
for
example,
24
16-ounce
cans,
the
price
in
kentucky
is
$4.45;
the
price
in
indiana
is
$5.00...
a
55-cent
difference.
they
raised
the
indiana
price
15
cents;
they
raised
the
kentucky
price
a
dime.
the
differential
is
now
60
cents.
how
can
this
possibly
be
any
evidence
of
good
faith
meeting
competition
when
you
continuously
throughout
the
period
raise,
raise,
raise,
in
both
markets,
but
you
preserve
the
differential?
mr.
john
t.
cusack
both
states,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
i'm
sorry.
that's
a
slip.
i
worked
on
the
pabst
case
where
we
had
states
as
a
separate
market
for
purposes
of
brewery
mergers.
it's
clear
that
henderson...
just
a
very
fast...
it's
clear
the
market
is
the
same;
that
the
henderson-evansville
market...
it's...
it's
a
geographically
isolated
area
where
people
in
kentucky
work
in
indiana
and
people
in
indiana
work
in
kentucky.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
our
client
competes,
your
honor,
with
beer
distributors
in
the
relevant
geographic
market,
which
is
the
henderson...
the
evansville-henderson
smsa,
and
including
to
some
extent--
mr.
john
t.
cusack
--no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
our
client
sells
to
retailers
in
indiana
who
have
an
indiana
basic
permit.
it
is
the
consumers,
however,
who
buy
beer
in
both
markets.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
submit
that
when
people
buy
beer
in
virginia
and
live
in
the
district
of
columbia,
or
vice-versa,
and
in
maryland,
they
do
the
same
thing.
all
states,
as
i
understand
it,
have
a
requirement
that
you're
not
supposed
to
take
beer
across
a
state
line,
and
it
is
ignored
completely.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
your
honor,
i
submit
it's
not
unlawful
if
it's
not
enforced.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
your
honor,
if
the
law
was
enforced
to
the
letter,
i
submit
the
bridges
over
the
potomac
would
be
very
crowded
with
policemen.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
the
reality
of
it,
your
honor,
is
that
it's
a
market.
whiting,
indiana,
your
honor,
and
chicago,
that's
a
market.
you've
got
liquor
stores
on
whiting,
indiana
on...
on
what
is
it,
indianapolis
boulevard,
and
people
from
indiana
are
going
there
all
the
time.
it's
never
been
enforced.
the
thing
in
evansville,
yes,
at
one
time
in
1974
the
retailers
in
evansville
got
the
state
excise
police
to
put
some
policemen
on
the
bridge
to
stop
cars.
it
created
such
a
terrible
furor
that
they
stopped.
the
point
is
that
the
area
is
so
obviously
an
isolated,
unified
geographic
market.
and
i
submit--
mr.
john
t.
cusack
--yes.
and,
your
honor,
they
did
for
a
short
time
pick
people
up
going
into
kentucky,
but
they
stopped.
and
that's
the
evidence
in
the
case,
that
they
stopped
doing
this;
and
that
it
was
common
knowledge.
articles
in
the
evansville
newspapers
or
ads
in
the
evansville
newspapers,
cheapest
beer
in
the
tri-state
area.
it's
a
continuous
crossover.
the
one
bit
of
evidence
we
didn't
put
in
our
brief
which
i
think
is
interesting,
mr.
powell
of
the
house
of
beverages,
which
is
the
big
liquor
store
in
kentucky
along
the
strip
where
so
many
people
from
indiana
went,
he
complained...
his
deposition,
incidentally,
was
taken
by
mr.
adler...
he
complained
at
the
time
he
was
losing
tremendous
liquor
sales
to
lower
indiana
prices.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
indiana
law,
the
one-price
law,
applies
to
sales
of
liquor
as
well
as
beer.
why
is
it
that
liquor
was
cheaper
in
indiana
than
in
kentucky
while
beer
was
so
much
more?
it
was
an
artificially
set
price.
west
virginia
is
a
one-price
state.
west
virginia
was
priced
cheaper
by
falls
city
than
indiana.
why
is
indiana
discriminated
against?
it's
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
the
price
system
in
this
case
i
submit
is
simply
this:
the
system
by
which
falls
city
and
its
brewer
competitors,
with
the
noticeable
exception
of
drury's,
continuously
charged
a
higher
price
in
indiana
than
they
did
in
other
states.
the
evidence
shows
that
falls
city
was
not
meeting
competition
in
good
faith,
was
never
interested
in
competing
on
the
basis
of
price,
nor
ever
competed
on
the
basis
of
price,
and
never
set
up
a
nondiscriminatory
pricing
structure
as
commanded
by
the
statute.
and
when
falls
city
received
any
pressure
in
regard
to
its
high
and
discriminatory
prices
in
indiana
such
as
in
1973
with
the
attempt
by
the
principal
of
vanco
to
get
the
indiana
legislature
to
pass
a
law
that
brewers
would
not
charge
higher
prices
to
indiana
distributors
than
it
did
to
distributors
in
adjoining
states,
or
the
threat
of
the
pendency
of
this
lawsuit
and
the
institution
of
this
lawsuit,
falls
city
turned
to
its
major
brewers,
competitors,
members
of
the
united
states
brewers
association,
for
help
in
order
to
perpetuate
this
persistent
and
substantial
price
discrimination.
how
is
that
possibly
in
good
faith?
contrary
to
the
repeated
testimony
from
mr.
tate,
and
he
told
judge
holder
that,
"i
have
never
ever
known
a
small
brewery
our
size
to
step
out
and
lead
the
parade."
--in
reference
to
prices...
and
he
told
mr.
adler,
"we
sort
of
followed
along
what
pabst
and
stroh
did
in
most
cases."
and
it's
not
refuted
by
falls
city
in
its
reply
brief.
falls
city
led
off
at
least
one
price
increase
in
indiana,
the
july
1974
price
increase,
on
which
day
falls
city
also
increased
prices
in
kentucky.
and,
incidentally,
falls
city
never
really
showed
who
the
leading
brewers
were
in
kentucky,
but
a
document
submitted
by
mr.
tate
in
evidence
shows
that
from
1962
to
1969
falls
city
was
the
leading
brewer
in
kentucky.
and
this
cry
that
they're
so
small
and
put
upon
i
think
should
be
evaluated
in
that
light.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
but
large,
your
honor,
in
relation
to
the
market;
large
in
relation
to
where
they
were
selling
beer;
large
in
relation
to
kentucky,
southern
indiana,
parts
of
ohio,
tennessee,
west
virginia.
it
was
a
regional
brewer
which
had
substantial
sales
in
those
states.
as
i
say,
number
one
in
indiana...
excuse
me...
in
kentucky
until
1969
where
it
dropped
from
'70...
in
'71
to
second
place,
and
that's
as
far
as
the
statistics
go.
your
honor,
the
court
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
court
in
staley
said...
and
it's
true
as
it
was
then...
and,
incidentally,
the
thrust
of
our
argument
in
the
seventh
circuit
was
the
staley
case,
which
we
think
is
the
finest
decision
by
the
court
in
regard
to
good
faith
meeting
competition...
that
you
cannot
meet
competition
by
following
the
higher
prices
of
your
competitors.
in
staley
the
court
said...
this
court
said
the
statutory
test
is
whether
respondents
by
their
basing
point
system
adopted
a
lower
price
in
good
faith
to
meet
an
equally
low
price
of
a
competitor.
this
test
presupposes
that
the
person
charged
with
violating
the
act
would
by
his
normal
nondiscriminatory
pricing
methods
have
reached
a
price
so
high
he
would
reduce
it
in
order
to
meet
the
competitor's
equally
low
price.
instead
they,
staley,
maintained
their
own
prices
at
a
level
of
the
competitors'
high
price
based
upon
the
competitor's
high
cost
of
delivery
by
including
phantom
freight
in
their
own
delivered
prices.
vanco
is
a
better
case
than
staley.
there
are
no
cost
savings
in
southern
indiana
over...
in
indiana
over
the
twelve
other
states
where
falls
city
sold
beer,
as
mr.
tate
stated
that
his
costs
were
identical
in
all
states.
he
also
said
in
regard
to
that
that
the
identity
of
his
competitors
in
both
states
were
practically
identical.
a
footnote
in
staley
states
that
the
chairman
of
the
house
conferees
on
the
robinson-patman
act
had
presented
a
conference
report
emphasized
with
illustrations
that
the
2(b)
procedural
provision
cannot
be
construed
as
a
carte
blanche
exemption...
exception
to
violate
the
bill
so
long
as
a
competitor
can
be
shown
to
have
violated
it
first,
nor
so
long
as
that
competition
cannot
be
met
without
the
use
of
oppressive
discriminations
in
violation
of
the
obvious
intent
of
the
bill.
in
staley
the
court
also
stated
the
commission's
conclusions
in
regard
to
the
meeting
competition
defense
"it
seems
inescapable
that
staley's
discriminations
such
as
those
between
purchasers
in
chicago
and
decatur
were
established
not
to
meet
equally
low
chicago
prices
of
competitors
there,
but
in
order
to
establish
elsewhere
the
artificially
high
prices
whose
discriminatory
effect
permeates
respondent's
entire
pricing
system."
lastly,
the
court
said,
"we
cannot
say
that
a
seller
acts
in
good
faith
when
it
chooses
to
adopt
such
a
clearly
discriminatory
pricing
system,
at
least
where
it
never
attempted
to
set
up
a
nondiscriminatory
system."
falls
city,
as
in
the
case
of
staley,
maintained
their
own
prices
at
the
level
of
their
competitors'
high
prices,
did
not...
and
did
not
meet
the
test
that
the
person
charged
with
violating
the
act
would
by
his
normal,
nondiscriminatory
pricing
methods
have
reached
a
price
so
high
that
he'd
reduce
it
in
order
to
meet
the
competitor's
equally
low
price.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
interesting
thing
about
it
is
they
admitted...
the
court
in
staley
also
said
that
some
of
the
phantom
freight...
there
was
some
phantom
freight
and
there
was
some
valid
freight,
and
they've
got
that
chart
in
there
where
some
of
the
prices
were
perfectly
fair.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
well,
i
think
that's
probably
right.
it
depended
upon
where
the
customers
were
located
primarily,
and
the
difference
between
the
kansas
city
plant
and
the
chicago
plant.
but,
you
know,
in
staley
you
had
at
least
some
freight
absorption
because
the
sucrose
was
sold
and
delivered
to
the
customer.
here
you
have
no
such
a
situation,
your
honor,
because
it's
all
fob
the
plant,
which
is,
incidentally,
my
understanding
of
what
happens
throughout
the
brewing
industry
based
on
my
experience.
all
beer
is
sold
fob
the
brewery.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
solicitor
general's
representative
has
mentioned
the
1955
attorney
general's
report
on
the
antitrust
laws.
it's
the
attorney
general's
national
committee
to
study
the
antitrust
laws.
that
report
states
at
page
184,
"we
recommend
that
the
term
"good
faith"
be
utilized
solely
to
test
the
seller's
adherence
to
the
basic
objectives
of
the
meeting
competition
proviso,
facilitating
price
reductions
in
genuine
response
to
competitive
market
pressures
in
order
to
equalize
an
opportunity."
"in
practice
this
will
disqualify
the
seller
to
whom
meeting
of
competition
is
only
an
incidental
by-product
of
a
scheme
to
monopolize
or
other
objective
inimicable
to
overall
antitrust
policy."
and
i
submit
that
it
is
inimicable
to
overall
antitrust
policy
for
all
brewers
to
charge
higher
prices
in
indiana
merely
because
their
competitors
do
so.
and
to
stand
around
in
a
circle
and
to
point
with
each
other
is
a
perversion
of
the
legislative
intent,
and
contrary
to
what
congressman
ottoback
talked
about;
and
that's
really
what
they're
talking
about.
they
have
relied
on
the
ingliss
case
out
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
am
very
happy
that
they
have
relied
on
that.
i
represented
american
bakeries
company
in
that
case.
after
a
five-week
jury
trial
our
client
was
held
not
liable.
the
distinction
between
ingliss
and
the
distinction
between
vanco
is
simply
this:
in
ingliss
there
was
intense
competition,
and
the
prices
went
down.
not
so
in
vanco.
the

the

competitive
nature
of
the
northern
california
market."
"in
all
cases
continental
responded
to
some
activity
of
lower
prices
offered
by
its
competitors."
"although
this
court
recognizes
that
the
question
of
good
faith
is
appropriately
left
for
the
jury,
it
cannot
let
stand
what
it
views
as
a
totally
erroneous
result."
mr.
john

cusack
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
well,
it--
mr.
john
t.
cusack
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
it
was
the
higher
price.
the
artificially
high
indiana
price
was
the
illegal
price,
the
discriminatory
price,
your
honor.
i
don't...
there's
no
evidence
where
their
other
prices
were.
we--
mr.
john
t.
cusack
--yes,
your
honor.
i
say
the
higher
price
was
the...
the
price
that
falls
city
focused
on
was
the
higher
indiana
price.
that
was
the
illegal
price.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
that
was
the
discriminatory
price,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cusack
well,
it's
supposed
to
be--
mr.
john
t.
cusack
--yes,
your
honor,
according
to
the
rules
of
the
court.
well,
it's
a
good
faith
test.
it
can
be
an
unlawful
price,
but
if
you
think
it
is
a
lawful
price,
it's
a
subjective
test,
as
judge
williams
said
in
california.
if
you
think
it's
a
lawful
price,
you
can
meet
it.
