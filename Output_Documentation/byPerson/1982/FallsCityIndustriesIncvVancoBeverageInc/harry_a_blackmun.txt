justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
by
way
of
certiorari
to
the
--
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it's
an
antitrust
case
that
centers
in
section
2(a)
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
by
the
robinson-patman
act.
the
case
doesn't
lend
itself
very
well
to
description
from
the
bench.
i
think
it
suffices
to
say
that
the
petitioner
is
a
louisville
kentucky
brewer
which
sold
its
beer
to
the
respondent,
the
sole
wholesale
distributor
for
petitioner's
beer
in
evansville
and
vanderburgh
county,
indiana,
at
a
higher
price
than
the
petitioner
charged
its
only
distributor
in
henderson
county,
kentucky,
just
across
the
ohio
river.
under
indiana
law,
brewers
were
required
to
sell
to
all
indiana
wholesalers
at
the
same
price
and
wholesalers
were
prohibited
from
selling
to
out-of-state
retailers
and
retailers
could
not
purchase
beer
from
out-of-state
wholesalers.
the
respondent
distributor
sued
the
brewer,
alleging
price
discrimination
that
violated
the
act
and
the
trial
court
held
that
the
distributor
had
established
a
prima
facia
case.
that
court
rejected
the
brewer's
defense
that
it
was
merely
meeting
competition
in
kentucky
and
hence
was
immune
from
liability
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
do
hold
that
competitive
injury
was
shown.
the
defense
of
meeting
competition,
however,
is
not
defeated
on
the
theory
that
the
price
difference
resulted
from
increases
in
indiana
rather
than
decreases
in
kentucky.
the
standard
governing
the
requirement
of
a
good
faith
response
is
the
standard
of
prudent
businessman,
responding
fairly
to
what
he
reasonably
believes
is
a
situation
of
competitive
necessity.
the
trial
court
did
not
address
the
crucial
question
whether
the
kentucky
prices
remained
lower
than
the
indiana
prices
in
response
to
competitor's
prices
in
kentucky.
and
for
that
reason
we
reverse
and
remand.
the
decision
is
by
unanimous
court.
