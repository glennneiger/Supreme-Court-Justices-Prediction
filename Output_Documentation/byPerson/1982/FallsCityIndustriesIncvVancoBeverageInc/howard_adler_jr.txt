mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
asking
the
court
to
reverse
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
upheld
a
district
court
judgment
finding
that
falls
city
had
violated
the
robinson-patman
act
in
its
sales
of
beer
to
the
respondent
vanco,
which
was
a
distributor
of
falls
city
and
other
beers
in
evansville,
indiana.
it
is
our
position,
and
the
united
states
in
the
federal
trade
commission
agreed,
that
the
lower
courts
applied
a
legally
erroneous
interpretation
of
section
2(b)
of
the
robinson-patman
act
in
rejecting
falls
city's
good
faith
meeting
competition
defense.
we
also
contend
that
the
lower
courts
misapprehended
this
court's
morton
salt
decision
and
applied
an
overly
lenient
test
of
competitive
injury
under
section
2(a)
of
the
act.
i
expect,
unless
there
are
questions,
to
rest
on
our
brief
on
the
section
2(a)
competitive
injury
point,
and
in
the
time
i
have
in
oral
argument
to
address
the
meeting
competition
issue.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
i
think
there...
i
think
the
court
erred
in
finding
a
single
market,
but
i
think
at
the
posture
of
the
case
in
this
court
there
was
a
failure
to
prove
competitive
injury,
even
assuming
a
single
market.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
oh,
i
think
it's
a
very
important
issue,
and
if...
if
there
were
not
a
single
market...
that
is,
if
the
wholesalers
in
the
two
markets
were
not
in
competition
with
each
other...
these
would
not
be
actionable,
discriminatory
sales
under
section
2(a).
but
even
to
some
degree
they
are
in
competition
with
each
other,
there
are
still
many
other
matters
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
prove
regarding
causal
connection
between
the
price
differential
and
the
kind
of
injury
to
competition
and
the
kind
of
business
injury
that
is
actionable.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
i
think
that
is
somewhat
of
a
mixed
question.
our
problem
with
the
2(a)
case
is
that
the
court,
both
courts,
and
particularly
most
explicitly
the
court
of
appeals,
articulated
a
standard
of
injury
based
on
a
misapprehension
of
morton
salt
under
which
injury
was
virtually
presumed.
and
so
it
didn't
make
the
kind
of
careful
analysis
of
market
factors.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
there
would
be
no
robinson-patman.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
and
that
would
certainly
be...
that
would
be
one
way
the
case
could
have
ended
and
should
have
ended.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
are
many
factual
components
in
that,
and
i
think
in
our
posture--
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
--i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
delve
into
the
record
to
second-guess
that
determination
by
the
lower
courts.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
only
as
part
of
the
whole
complex
of
factors
that
the
court
failed
adequately
to
consider
because
of
its
simplistic
view
of
what's
required
on
proof
of
injury
under
2(a).
had
the
lower
courts
done
as
this
court
said
in
standard
oil
and
made
a
real
appraisal
of
competitive
facts,
we
would
have
prevailed
on
the
market
issue;
we
would
have
prevailed
on
all
kinds
of
causation
issue.
and
on
2(a)
i
think
realistically
the
courts,
lower
courts,
seventh
circuit,
should
be
instructed
that
they
cannot
presume
injury
and
that
they
should
make
a
searching
analysis
of
the
fact
to
see
whether
the
requisite
injury
is
shown.
the
courts...
the
morton
salt,
we
have
no
objection
to
it
per
se,
but
we
think
it
is...
has
been
misapplied.
the
standards
are
too
lenient.
the
courts
find
injury,
find
single
markets,
find
effects
on
competition
without
the
requisite
analysis
of
the
competitive
facts,
and
that
is
made
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
address
the
meeting
competition
issue
which
presupposes
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
of
injury.
we
don't
think
that
there
was,
but
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
of
injury,
we
believe
that
the
lower
courts
erred...
and
this
is
strictly
a
matter
of
law...
in
the
legal
standard,
in
the
things
that
they
thought
were
required
in
order
to
establish
a
good
faith
meeting
competition
defense.
the
robinson-patman--
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
i
assume
a
violation...
i
assume...
for
purposes
of
arguing
the
good
faith
meeting
competition--
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
--i
assume
a
violation,
which
the
court
said
in
standard
oil.
even
assuming
a
prima
facie
violation,
this
court--
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
--for
purposes
of
the...
for
the
purpose
of
the
2(b)--
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
--argument.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
yes.
the
sole
question
on
2(b)
is
whether
the
different
price,
even
though
assuming
for
analytical
purposes
that
it
created
a
prima
facie
violation--
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
--i'm
going
to
assume
that
for
purposes
of
the
section
2(b)
argument.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
yes.
unless
we
are
in
good
faith--
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
--meeting
lower
prices
of
competition.
this
whole
matter
arose
because
of
an
industry-wide
practice
of
not
only
falls
city
but
all
brewers
of
charging
different
prices
to
their
distributors
in
different
states.
falls
city
followed
that
practice.
vanco's
other
suppliers
followed
that
practice.
all
brewers
did.
and
there's
no
dispute
on
this.
the
court
expressly
found
that
other
brewers
had
different
prices
for
their
distributors
in
the
kentucky
portion
of
the
relevant
market
that
were
lower
than
the
prices
they
had
in
indiana.
faced
with
that
industry-wide
situation,
the
question
is
what
practical
alternatives
did
falls
city
have.
the
district
court
said
it
should
have
eliminated
the
competition...
the
discrimination
by
either
raising
the
price
or
lowering
the
price;
that
is,
raising
its
price...
excuse
me...
lowering
the
price
in
indiana
to
the
kentucky
level
or
else
raising
the
kentucky
price
so
that
it
would
be
equal
to
the
indiana
price.
this
was
not...
these
are
not
really
workable
alternatives.
this
was
not
anything
that
any
other
brewer
did.
it
would
have
meant
because
indiana
law
requires
all
wholesalers
to
be
charged
the
same
price
that
falls
city
would
have
had
to
undercut,
underprice
below
its
competitors
throughout
the
state
of
indiana,
not
just
to
vanco.
and
falls
city
president
testified
that
would
be
economically
disadvantageous,
and
there
is
no
obligation
to
price...
in
a
free
market
system
to
price
below
your
competition.
the
alternative
of
pricing
in
kentucky
at
the
higher
indiana
level
would,
of
course,
have
put
falls
city
above
its
competition,
and
this
is
precisely
what
we
believe
section
2(b)
is
intended
to
avoid...
the
problem
of
a
competitor
being
forced
to
price
above
the
competition,
above
the
price
level
of
its
competition.
judge
schweigert
in
his
dissent
found
a
much
better
answer:
charge...
for
falls
city...
charge
the
indiana
price,
which
was
a
free
market
normal
price,
charge
the
lower
price
in
kentucky
because
that
was
necessary
to
beat
the
competition
there;
and
he
said
that's
the
essence
of
a
good
faith
meeting
of
competition
defense.
i
think
that's
in
line
with
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
with
regard
to
section
2(b),
that
it's
a
pragmatic...
that
good
faith
is
a
pragmatic
and
flexible
concept
and
so
forth.
and
the
pragmatic
and
sensible
approach
here
was
for
falls
city
to
do
what
it
did,
follow
the
indiana
price,
follow
the
kentucky
price,
be
competitive
in
both
areas
with
the
brands
that
it
followed
which
were
the
nonpremium,
popular-priced
type
of
brands,
which
indeed
it
followed
through
market
information
and
the
like,
as
was
abundantly
testified
to
during
the
trial.
vanco
now
contends
that
the
good
faith
meeting
of
competition
question
was,
i
quote,
"a
pure
question
of
fact".
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
argued
to
the
court
extensively,
about
five
pages
of
its
brief,
under
the
heading
that
the
proffered
defense
was
contrary
to
settled
law.
and
it
argued
to
the
court
two
propositions:
section
2(b)
does
not
apply
unless
there
is
customer-by-customer
pricing;
that
the
use
of
a
price
system
is
not
meeting
competition
as
contemplated
by
2(b).
it
also
argued
that
the
meeting
of
competition
defense
depends
upon
a
lowering
of
prices;
that
you
are
not
meeting
competition
if
you
are
unable
to
raise
prices
because
of
competition;
there
must
be
an
actual
price
decrease.
we
submit
that
there's
no
difference
in
the
law
or
in
logic
or
in
economics
or
anything
else
between
lowering
a
price
to
meet
competition
and
being
unable
to
raise
a
price,
as
falls
city
was
unable
to
raise
its
kentucky
price
because
had
it
raised
it
would
not
have
been
competitive.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
vanco's
legal
argument.
its
rejection
of
the
2(b)
defense
proffered
by
falls
city
rested
on
two
pivotal
and
we
believe
clearly
erroneous
legal
propositions.
one
is
that
section
2(b)
does
not
justify
price
differences
that
result
merely
from
the
adoption
of
a
competitor's
discriminatory
pricing
structure;
that
the
act
places
emphasis
on
individual
situations
and
doesn't
apply
to
the
adoption
of
an
overall
pricing
structure.
secondly...
the
second
proposition
that
the
court
articulated
was
that
the...
2(b)
didn't
apply
because
the
discriminatory
pricing
resulted
not
from...
from
price
increases
in
indiana,
not
from
price
decreases;
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
falls
city
had
a
price
structure
and
then
reduced
its
prices...
this
is
the
court's
word...
reduced
its
prices
where
necessary
to
defend
against
competition.
so
that
contrary
to
what
vanco
has
said,
the
rejection
of
the
2(b)
defense
rested
clearly
on
two
legal
propositions,
both
of
which
are
erroneous,
both
of
which
depart
from
past
interpretations
of
2(b)
by
this
court,
both
of
which
are
antithetical
to
the
notion
that
you
should
accommodate
the
robinson-patman
act
with
other
goals
of
antitrust,
the
procompetitive
goals.
and
it
resulted
in
an
interpretation
that
prevented
falls
city
and
would
prevent
others
from
being
competitive,
i.e.,
maintaining
its
lower
competitive
price
in
kentucky.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
the
only
factual
finding
that
could
be
made
is
that
of
course
falls
city
raised
its
prices
in
indiana
when
competition
permitted.
the
testimony
on
this...
and
there's
no
two
ways
about
it,
and
there's
no
finding
to
the
contrary...
was
that
falls
city
was
a
price
follower.
it
was
a
small,
struggling
brewer.
it
was
driven
out
of
business.
it
went
out
of
business
in
1978
as
have,
as
you
know,
many
other
brewers.
and
it
was
a
price
follower,
a
price
taker.
and
that
is
clear
in
the
record.
and
when
competition
went
up
in
indiana,
it
went
up
with
the...
when
competition
permitted.
competition
didn't
permit
it
to
go
up
in
kentucky,
and
it
stayed
down.
and
that's
how
the
difference
arose.
and
one
can
look
at
it
and
say
okay,
the
differential
arose
because
of
raising
prices
in
indiana.
the
differential
arose
because
it
was
faced
with
different
competitive
circumstances
in
the
two
areas...
lower
prices
in
kentucky,
higher
prices
in
indiana.
it
was
a
price
taker
and
price
follower
in
both
circumstances.
vanco
here
now
is
making
a
big
attack
on
the
good
faith
and
the
reasonableness
of
falls
city's
pricing
practices.
it
makes,
as
we
showed
in
our
reply
brief,
a
rather
minimal
attempt
to
defend
the
legal
theories
which
it
successfully
persuaded
the
court
of
appeals
to
adopt,
and
it
seeks
now
to,
for
example,
cast
a
taint
of
illegality
on
falls
city's
pricing
saying
that
it
was
engaged
in
parallel
pricing,
collusive
pricing,
noncompetitive
pricing
and
the
like.
but
the
court
expressly
found
that
there
was
no
agreement
on
price
fixing;
it
rejected
the
claim
of
price
fixing.
and
those
allegations
i
think
are
totally,
totally
without
legal
significance.
falls
city
on
this
record
was
following
free
market,
lawful,
legitimate
competitive
prices
in
all
of
its
markets.
there
are
other
points
made
by
the
respondent
regarding
falls
city's
pricing.
they
say,
for
example,
that
it
didn't
show
anything
about
the
competitive
analysis
that
led
it
to
adopt
lower
prices
in
kentucky.
but
the
record
is
unequivocal
that
falls
city
got
pricing
information
through
its
sales
and
from
distributors
and
others;
that
it
made
every
reasonable
effort
that
a
business
in
this
position
would
make
to
keep
abreast
of
competitive
conditions,
and
using
that
information
it
set
these
prices.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
howard
adler,
jr.
i
think
it's
open
the
court,
but
it
isn't
the
question
presented
in
the
petition,
and
it
hasn't
been
briefed
by
the
parties,
although
this
court
certainly
could
entertain
that
issue
if
it
were
disposed
to
do
so.
