mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
department
of
justice
and
the
federal
trade
commission
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
seventh
circuit
used
the
wrong
legal
standard
when
it
rejected
the
meeting
competition
defense
raised
in
this
case.
we
therefore
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
error
and
should
be
reversed.
both
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
district
court
believe
that
the
meeting
competition
defense
was
unavailable
because
the
price
difference
here
resulted
from
uneven
price
increases
rather
than
some
identifiable
price
decrease.
the
courts
below
thought
it
necessary
to
find
some
lowering
of
prices
in
the
state
of
kentucky
before
the
defense
could
be
sustained.
this
holding
finds
no
support
in
the
literal
language
of
the
statute.
section
2(b)
only
requires
the
seller
to
show
that
his
lower
price
was
made
in
good
faith
to
meet
competition,
not
that
he
lowered
his
price
compared
to
some
pre-existing
standard.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals'
departure
from
the
statute's
literal
requirements
threatens
to
undermine
an
important
statutory
purpose.
during
periods
of
general
inflation
price
competition
often
may
take
the
form
of
moderate
price
increases
rather
than
outright
price
cuts.
in
this
situation
the
lower
price
of
the
seller,
even
though
it
is
the
end
product
of
a
moderate
price
increase,
may
well
be
a
form
of
competitive
self-defense
of
the
very
kind
which
congress
meant
to
protect.
in
addition,
if
the
law
really
did
require
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
then
sellers
like
falls
city
would
be
enforced
to
engage
in
costly
and
artificial
conduct
such
as
hiking
all
of
their
prices
to
a
particular
level
for
a
period
of
time
and
then
cutting
selectively
certain
prices
thereafter.
this
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
and
would
only
aggravate
the
problem
of
inflation
in
our
economy.
the
district
court
also
was
of
the
view
that
the
meeting
competition
defense
requires
proof
that
prices
were
adjusted
on
a
customer-by-customer
basis,
and
in
affirming
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
used
language
indicating
that
it
was
of
this
same
view.
this
also
was
a
mistaken
interpretation
of
the
statute.
section
2(b)
permits
a
price
difference
if
the
seller
shows
that
his
lower
price
to
a
purchaser
or
to
a
group
of
purchasers
was
made
in
good
faith
to
meet
the
price
of
a
rival.
the
test,
as
this
court
frequently
has
held,
is
flexible
and
pragmatic,
not
technical
or
doctrinaire.
the
seller
need
only
show
a
reasonable
and
good
faith
effort
to
meet
the
forces
of
competition.
the
statute
doesn't
attempt
to
dictate
what
method
the
seller
must
use
in
different
market
situations.
nothing
in
the
statute
or
its
legislative
history
says
that
a
seller
cannot
adopt
an
area-wide
price
when
that's
reasonably
necessary
to
meet
actual
competition.
as
the
facts
of
this
case
show,
the
seller's
rival
may
have
a
single
price
of
its
own
throughout
the
entire
region,
or
a
group
of
sellers
of
slightly
different
products
may
have
a
range
of
prices.
in
either
event,
a
single
price
which
is
reasonably
adjusted
to
meet
actual
competition
prevailing
in
the
area
is
a
permissible
response.
customer-by-customer
pricing
often
would
be
a
complete
waste
of
time
when
a
larger
rival
charges
a
single
price
throughout
the
area
and
could
impose
substantial
burdens
on
small
sellers
attempting
to
survive
in
a
competitive
market
environment.
now,
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals,
nothing
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
staley
case
requires
a
rejection
of
falls
city's
meeting
competition
defense
here.
staley
rested
on
the
conclusion
that
the
sellers
there
lacked
good
faith
because
they
copied
an
artificial
basing
point
system
which
imposed
substantial
phantom
or
unearned
freight
charges
on
particular
purchasers.
the
court
concluded
that
the
basing
point
system
was
inherently
unlawful
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
and
therefore
its
adoption
could
not
be
characterized
as
good
faith
action.
in
addition,
the
ftc
explained
in
its
opinion
in
the
staley
case
that
the
basing
point
system
was
the
product
of
collusion,
and
that
also
undercut
any
claim
of
good
faith
action.
now,
in
this
case,
by
contrast--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--as
this
court
held
in
staley,
it
isn't
necessary
to
prove
precisely
what
the
prices
were.
it
is
necessary
to
prove
a
good
faith
and
reasonable
effort
to
approximate
what
reasonable
and
believable
prices
were.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
if...
if...
no,
it
could
not
deliberately
undercut
prices
in
kentucky,
but
it--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--and
it
did
just
that.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
it
did
that.
it
made
a
reasonable
effort
to
monitor
those
prices.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
it...
if...
there
was
evidence
to
the
effect
that
this
was
a
regional
beer
that
didn't
command
the
same
premium
price
that
budweiser
and
other
beers
commanded,
which
would
permit
a
little
bit
of
an
undercutting
under
our
analysis.
but
here
there
wasn't
even
that
element
of
undercutting.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
point
is
made
in
the
'55
attorney
general's
study
on
the
antitrust
laws
which
we
subscribe
to.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is
it,
period.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
these
additional
standards
that
are
talked
about
in
the
lower
court
opinions
are
completely
without
statutory
basis.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and
long
as
there
was
a
good
faith
effort
to
meet
prices
charged
their
customers
in
the
state
of
kentucky,
that
is
it.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
and--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--well,
if
vanco
was--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--if
vanco
was
the
only
customer
in
the
state
of--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--indiana
and
there
were
lower
prices
prevailing--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--in
kentucky,
the
differential
would
be
permissible,
yes.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
indiana
does
indeed
compel
a
single--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--throughout
the
state.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
no,
that's
correct.
vanco
argues,
nonetheless,
in
this
case
that
falls
city
acted
with
bad
faith
because
it
matched
what
it
calls
artificially
high
prices
in
the
state
of
indiana.
with
deference,
we
submits
that
this
amounts
to
name-calling
without
any
legal
substance.
vanco
failed
to
prove
that
the
prices
were
unlawful
under
the
sherman
act
or
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
and
merely
characterizing
them
as
high
or
artificial
doesn't
make
them
unlawful.
in
the
absence
of
collusion
each
seller
is
permitted
to
charge
its
profit-maximizing
price.
this
is
the
very
essence
of
a
free
enterprise
competitive
system.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
that
is...
that
is
a
possibility.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
but
there
are
state
law--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--yes,
but
there
are
state
law
barriers
between
the
states
that
prevent
arbitrage
back
and
forth.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
the
indiana
price
could
be
lowered,
but
there
were
state
laws
that
prevented
sales
back
and
forth
from
the
states
that
could
result
in
competition
producing
different
price
levels.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
well,
what
it
does
is
explain
that
different
pricing
structures
could
occur
in
the
states
without
the
presence
of
collusion.
that's
the
significance
of
the
state
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
in...
well,
they...
it
is
the
same
market
pursuant
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
but
it's
undeniable
that
there
are
legal
restrictions
that
to
some
extent
at
least
carve
differences
between
these
two
markets.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
because
the
court--
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
--we
think
that
it's
sufficient
under
section
2(b)
for
the
defendant
to
show
that
there
was
a
price
prevailing
in
each
state
that
was
different,
that
its
competitors
were
charging
that
price,
and
that
it
reasonably
attempted
to
match
that
price,
and
that
that
is
all
that
section
2(b)
requires.
mr.
stephen
m.
shapiro
we
don't
concede
that
because
there
is
the
undeniable
fact
of
a
difference
between
the
two
markets.
even
though
you
can
characterize
them
as
one
market,
as
the
district
court
did,
there
are
vastly
different
legal
frameworks
that
the
two
states
operate
under.
and
you
may
well
characterize
that
as
a
bifurcation
of
the
markets,
which
we
certainly
wouldn't
quarrel
with,
but
these
are
realities
of
the
two
markets
that
we
think
can't
be
discounted
and
that
definitely
do
explain
the
different
price
levels
that
your
honor
mentioned.
