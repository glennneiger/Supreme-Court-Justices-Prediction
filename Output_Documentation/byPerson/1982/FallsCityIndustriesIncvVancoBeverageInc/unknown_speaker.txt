unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
have
a
question
about
that,
counsel.
do
you
agree
there's
one
market
in
this
case,
or
do
you
think
there
are
two?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the
question
whether
there
is
one
or
two
markets
is
relevant
to
the
competitive
injury
issue?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
adler,
i
guess
both
the
district
court
found
one
market
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
is
that
a...
whether
or
not
there's
one
or
two
markets,
is
that
a
question
of
fact
or
law?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
were
two
markets
here
there
wouldn't
be
any
robinson--
unknown
speaker
--no.
then
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
so,
i
don't
understand
why
you
don't
argue
the
question
of
whether
there
are
one
or
two
markets.
if
it's
a
question
of
law,
and
we
may,
notwithstanding
the
current
finding--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you're
not
willing
to
argue
that
there
are
two
markets.
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
address
it
in
your
petition
either,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
one
other
case?
then
your
submission
is
that
we
should
assume
for
purposes
of
analyzing
the
good
faith
defense
that
the
law
required
as
a
prima
facie
matter
your
client
to
charge
the
same
price
in
kentucky
and
indiana.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
how
will
we
get
to
the
2(b)
defense?
don't
you
assume
a
violation
first
and
then
say
we
can
defend
against--
unknown
speaker
--correct.
that's
what
i
mean.
unknown
speaker
which
means
that
you
assume
you
were
under
a
duty
to
charge
the
same
price
in
kentucky
and
indiana.
except
for
the--
unknown
speaker
--correct.
unknown
speaker
except
for...
unless
you
can
defend
that
under
2(b).
unknown
speaker
right.
you
said
you
don't
argue
that
today.
you're
going
to
assume
that.
unknown
speaker
right.
which,
in
turn,
is
all
i'm
suggesting.
you
are
therefore
assuming
for
the
purpose
of
the
argument
you're
about
to
make--
unknown
speaker
--that
you
are
under
a
duty,
a
statutory
duty,
to
charge
the
same
price
in
kentucky
and
indiana.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
adler,
did
the
court
not
also
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
your
client
raised
its
prices
in
indiana
not
for
competitive
reasons
but
for
other
reasons,
and
what
do
we
do
with
a
factual
finding
like
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
before
you
start,
would
you
mind,
do
you
think
it's
open
to
the
court
to
address
the
question
whether
there
are
one
or
two
markets?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shapiro,
may
i
interrupt
a
minute?
what
do
you...
in
the
government's
view
what
did
the
defendant
have
to
prove
to
establish
the
good
faith
meeting
defense
about
the...
what
did
it
have
to
prove
is
going
on
in
kentucky
to
justify
the
defense?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view
is
the
defense
made
out
if
the
price
of
falls
city
in
kentucky
was
lower
than
any
of
its
competitors?
unknown
speaker
it
must
prove
there
were
prices
in
kentucky
that
were
at
least
as
low
as
its
prices.
unknown
speaker
does
it
have
to
prove
anything
about
the
quality
of
the
products
being
sold
by
the
competition?
if
there
were
normally
premium
beers
and
standard
price
beers
would
that
be
relevant?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your...
but
under
your
analysis
it
then
would
have
been
permissible
even
if
they'd
undercut
by
no
more
than
the
reasonable
margin
between
the
premium
and
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
do
i
understand,
mr.
shapiro,
that
all
really
they
had
to
do
to
prove
the
meeting
competition
defense
was
that
in
good
faith
they
met
the
lower
kentucky
price,
period?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
they
had
to
do.
unknown
speaker
and
area
pricing
and
all
that
becomes
quite
irrelevant,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
true
if
falls
city
was...
if
this
particular
plaintiff
was
the
only
customer
in
indiana?
unknown
speaker
they
charged
the
low
price
in
kentucky,
had
one
indiana
customer
in
the
same
market
and
they
charged
him
an
extra
30
percent.
unknown
speaker
because
they
can
get
away
with
it.
because
he's
willing
to
pay
it.
unknown
speaker
in
indiana.
unknown
speaker
in
kentucky.
unknown
speaker
even
though
he's
the
only
customer.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
part
that's
because
the
indiana
statute
compels
him,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
wouldn't
compel
a
price
higher
than
they
charged
in
kentucky,
though.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
demonstrable
that
the
higher
price
is
above
the
free
market
price
because
competition
has
set
the
kentucky
price,
and
it's
all
one
market.
unknown
speaker
we
must
assume
that
the
indiana
price
is
above
the
price
that
a
free
market
would
set,
if
you
assume
it's
all
one
market.
unknown
speaker
because
your
submission
is
the
kentucky
price
is
set
by
competitive
forces.
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
there
was
no
state
law
barrier
to
lowering
the
indiana
price.
unknown
speaker
unless
you
take
the
position
justice
brennan
suggested
that
there
are
two
markets
here,
how
is
that
relevant?
unknown
speaker
there
can
be
different
pricing
structures
in
the
same
market?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
government's
position
on
whether
there
were
one
market
or
two,
whether
there
was
one
market
or
two?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that's
relevant
and
you
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
that
to
make
an
intelligent
analysis
of
the
competitive
defense?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
not
agree
that
if
the
price
in
kentucky
is
set
by
competitive
forces
and
if
the
price
in
indiana
is
in
the
same
market,
necessarily
the
price
in
indiana
is
above
the
market
price?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cusack,
you
used
the
term
"both
markets".
unknown
speaker
did
you
mean
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
your
client
compete
with...
with
whom
does
your
client
compete?
unknown
speaker
does
your
client
sell
to
any
single
customer
that
the
distributors
in
henderson
sell
to?
unknown
speaker
but
aren't
they
doing
so
illegally
when
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
the
entire
competition
that
you're
concerned
with
here
is
unlawful
competition,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
but
if
the
laws
were
enforced
to
the
letter,
there
would
be
no
competition--
unknown
speaker
--well--
unknown
speaker
--you'd
better
be
careful
about
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia.
they
do
pick
you
up.
[laughter]
i
mean
don't
assume
it's
just
like
out
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
took
that
to
mean
small
in
relation
to
the
giants,
not
to
the
locals.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cusack?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
the
court
in
staley
gave
some
weight
to
the
fact
that
staley
had
throughout
its
entire
pricing
structure
the
element
of
phantom
freight
built
in,
so
there
was
kind
of
a
unitary
price
structure?
unknown
speaker
but
it
was
almost
a
coincidence
that
they
were
fair
in
staley.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cusack,
do
you
believe
the...
do
you
believe
the
brewers
were
violating
the
robinson-patman
act
by
selling
at
different
prices
in
the
two
states?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the...
so
the
people
who
were
charged
higher
prices
in
indiana
should
have
been
able
to
sue
the...
any
brewer
or...
right?
unknown
speaker
and
their
lower
price
in
kentucky
was
illegal.
that's
your...
everybody--
unknown
speaker
--everybody's
lower
price
in
kentucky
was
illegal.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
or
the
other
price
was
illegal.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
the--
unknown
speaker
--does
the
lower
price
that
a
competitor
is
meeting,
is
that
supposed
to
be
a
legal
price
or
not?
unknown
speaker
does
the
price
that
you're
meeting
have
to
be
a
lawful
price?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the...
i
suppose
the
brewers
who...
whom...
who
you
say
were
violating
the
robinson-patman
act
by
charging
different
prices
in
two
states
could
cure
their...
could
cure
what
was
wrong
by
raising
the
price
in
kentucky.
