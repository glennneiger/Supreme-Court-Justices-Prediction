justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
put
on
any
evidence
to
say
that
it
wouldn't
happen
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
kind
of
evidence
was
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
you
know
what
the
fbi
is
going
to
do
next
year?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was,
do
you
know
what
the
fbi
is
going
to
do
tomorrow?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
what
the
senate
is
going
to
do
tomorrow?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are
gone
right
now,
you
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
senate
say,
and
the
fbi
will
never
do
it
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
understand
what
your
answer
is.
i
asked
you,
could
you
predict
what
the
fbi
was
going
to
do
in
the
future.
that
is
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
truthful
answer
could
possibly
be,
you
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could
have
answered
that
15
minutes
ago.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
brown,
can
i
back
you
up
just
a
minute?
what
relationship
in
time
was
there
with
this
95,000
vote
for
this
woman
and
the
revival
of
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
you
don't
see
any
connection
to
it.
i
am
not
blaming
you
for
it
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
connect
it
if
it
is
that
far
apart.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
true
that
in
an
equity
case
decided
as
of
the
time
the
judgment
is
entered
and
as
of
this
moment,
is
it
not
true
that
there
is
not
one
iota
of
evidence
that
the
fbi
or
any
other
government
agency
is
doing
anything
against
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
or
is
it
not
true?
if
it
is
true,
give
it,
and
let
me
hear
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
you
will
answer
my
question
yes
or
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
had
a
suit
for
$6
million.
they
didn't
mention
me
either.

justice
thurgood

this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio.
the
court
there
held
that
certain
campaign
disclosure
provisions
of
the
ohio
campaign
expense
reporting
law
cannot
be
constitutionally
apply
to
the
ohio
socialist
workers
party.
the
ohio
statute
requires
every
political
party
to
report
the
names
and
addresses
of
campaign
contributors
and
recipients
of
campaign
expenditures.
the
district
court
concluded
that
if
appellees
were
compelled
to
identify
all
contributors
and
recipients,
those
identified
might
be
subject
to
public
harassment
and
hostility.
accordingly,
that
court
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
disclosure
provisions
against
the
appellees.
we
hold
that
the
ohio
statute
cannot
be
constitutionally
applied
to
the
socialist
workers
party.
the
first
amendment
protects
against
to
compel
disclosure
of
political
association
and
beliefs.
in
our
view,
a
state
may
not
compel
a
minor
party
to
disclose
the
identities
of
campaign
contributors,
all
recipients
of
campaign
expenditures.
if
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
a
disclosure
will
subject
them
--
subject
those
identified
to
threats,
harassment,
or
reprisals,
such
a
reasonable
probability
was
demonstrated
by
the
evidence
of
governmental
and
private
hostility
toward
appellees.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
affirmed.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
o'connor
joined
by
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
