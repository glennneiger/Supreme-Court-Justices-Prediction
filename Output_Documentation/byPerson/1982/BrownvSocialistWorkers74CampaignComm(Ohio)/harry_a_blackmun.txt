justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
judgment
itself
you
are
referring
to.
mr.
brown,
there
was
no
determination
as
to
facial
validity,
was
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
specifically?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
far
is
pittsburgh
from
the
ohio
line?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what
about
pollard
against
roberts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
was
a
republican
candidate.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
just
don't
want
you
to
give
up
so
easily.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
brown,
time-wise,
where
does
the
line
of
demarcation
come?
suppose
the
fbi
had
announced
last
week
that
it
was
terminating?
is
the
case
any
different?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose
it
is
three
years
ago.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
position
is
that
it
has
to
be
unreasonable
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
conclusions
of
the
three-judge
court
have
to
be
unreasonable
on
the
evidence
that
was
submitted.
if
it
is
eleven
years
ago,
it
is
unreasonable.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
it
was
three
years
ago--
