mr.
gary
elson
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
the
provisions
of
ohio's
campaign
expense
reporting
act,
which
requires
campaign
committees
to
file
reports
setting
forth
various
information
concerning
their
receipt
and
expenditure
of
campaign
funds.
this
case
was
initiated
in
1974
by
various
socialist
workers
party
candidates
and
their
campaign
committees
along
with
several
unnamed
persons
who
claimed
to
have
made
contributions
to
or
received
expenditures
from
those
campaign
committees.
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
entered
soon
after
this
case
was
filed,
and
it
enjoined
the
application
of
the
disclosure
provisions
of
the
ohio
law
to
the
socialist
workers
party
candidates
and
their
committees
throughout
the
pendency
of
this
action.
the
case
was
tried
in
february
of
1981,
and
on
june
25,
1981,
a
three-judge
panel
held
that
the
disclosure
provisions
of
ohio
revised
code
sections
3517.10
and
3517.11
are
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
socialist
workers
party
and
the
class
represented
by
the
individual
appellees
in
that
case.
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
erred
in
so
holding
because
it
misapplied
the
test
established
by
this
court
in
buckley
versus
valeo,
in
1976.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
it
is
a
matter
of
applying
the
law
of
the
case
in
buckley
versus
valeo.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
we
are
going
to
have
to
apply
the
facts
to
the
law.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
absolutely
not.
we
think
the
buckley
test
is
most
acceptable.
we
think
the
district
court
in
applying
the
facts
in
this
case
to
the
buckley
test
misapplied
the
buckley
test.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
it
is
one
of
those
cases
where
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
because--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--not,
i
don't...
you
don't
have
to
dispute
any
of
the
court's
factual
findings.
what
i
am
asking
you
to
do
is
find
that
the
court
applied
this
court's
buckley
standard
improperly.
it
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
obviously,
the
buckley
test
itself
requires
a
mixed
law
and
fact
consideration,
your
honor.
specifically,
and
this
is
our
primary
point
in
this
case,
specifically,
the
evidence
presented
in
the
district
court
did
not
demonstrate
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
disclosure
of
the
names
of
contributors
to
socialist
worker
party
candidates
in
ohio
and
the
disclosure
of
the
names
of
persons
receiving
funds
from
swp
candidates'
campaign
committees
would
subject
those
contributors
or
recipients
of
expenditures
to
threats,
harassment,
or
reprisals,
which
is
what
this
court
said
to
look
for
in
buckley
versus
valeo.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
that
is
an
application
of
this
court's
standards
to
the
facts
in
the
case.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
the
bottom
line
question.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
coming
out
of
buckley
versus
valeo.
it
is
the
application
of
this
court's
buckley
test--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--we
are
saying
that
the
record
considered
as
a
whole
does
not
support
the
finding
made
by
the
district
court
in
this
case.
as
we
go
through
our
discussion
of
the
case,
i
will
further
explain
why
i
think
the
totality
if
the
evidence
does
not
support
that
finding.
in
this
case,
despite
joining
unnamed
john
doe
plaintiffs
who
allegedly
contributed
to
or
received
campaign
funds
from
the
socialist
worker
party
candidates,
the
appellees
failed
to
produce
any
evidence,
any
evidence
in
the
district
court
of
any
actual
or
threatened
harassment
of
a
single
contributor
or
recipient
of
campaign
expenditures
in
ohio.
additionally,
and
this,
justice
white,
is
the
biggest
problem
we
have
with
the
evidence,
additionally,
the
vast
majority
of
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
appellees
in
this
case
pertained
to
historical
past
activities
of
agencies
of
the
federal
government
over
which
the
state
of
ohio
has
absolutely
no
control.
moreover,
the
activities
of
these
federal
agencies
took
place
irrespective
of
and
in
the
absence
of
ohio's
campaign
expense
reporting
law.
there
is
no
cause
and
effect
relationship
between
our
act
and
the
conduct
and
the
misconduct
of
the
fbi.
of
the
127
exhibits
admitted
into
evidence
at
trial
on
this
case,
121
of
those
exhibits
pertained
solely
to
fbi
activities
which
were
discontinued,
which
were
discontinued
in
1971.
this
case
went
to
trial
in
1981.
our
position
is
that
this
fbi
conduct
and
misconduct
may
not
be
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
it
is
of
no
material
of
probative
value
certainly
in
1981,
especially
in
view
of
the--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
we
cited--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--we
cited
the
oregon
case
which
contained
references
to
affidavits--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--i
have
a
good
feeling
of
what
the
fbi
is
not
going
to
do
next
year.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that.
i
doubt
if
the
fbi
knows
that.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
okay.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
1981.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
i
wasn't
trial
counsel,
so
i
can't
say
with
certainty
what
happened,
but
i
think
originally
the
tro
was
entered
on
the
premise
that
the
case
would
be
rapidly
tried,
and
for
various
reasons,
just
like
any
lawsuit,
it
did
not
get
rapidly
tried.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
we
have
had
several
cases
in
our
office
that
took
that
long,
your
honor.
i
guess
that
is
why
i
said
that.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
it
was
never
converted.
the
original
tro
entered
in
this
case
in
and
of
itself
by
the
original
trial
court
was
rather
strange
in
that
the
court
entered
a
tro
during
the
pendency
of
the
action
which
would
not
expire
until
the
case
was
decided
by
a
three-judge
panel
which
hadn't
even
been
empaneled
yet.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
i
certainly
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
rehnquist.
like
i
said,
i
didn't
file...
for
appeal.
i
wasn't
trial
counsel.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
yes,
they
requested
the
temporary
restraining
order.
i
don't
know
whether
they
requested
it
for
the
entire
pendency
of
the
action
or
not,
but
even
if
they
did,
i
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
civil
rules.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
my
predecessors
in
this
case
never
challenged
that,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
they
most
certainly
did.
i
do
believe--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--well,
the
state
is
now
terribly
upset
about
it.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
they
didn't
know
at
the
time
it
was
going
to
take
six
years.
i
imagine
that
it
was
tolerated
through
time
on
the
premise
that
the
case
would
be
decided
much
more
rapidly
than
it
was.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
it
has
some
relationship
to
no
threats
or
harassments...
because
we
weren't
listing
their
identities,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
detract
from
my
argument
that
the
fbi
evidence
is
very,
very
stale
and
of
no
future
probative
value,
which
is
my
major
evidentiary
argument,
and
which
i
think
is
the
key
to
this
case.
justice
marshall,
you
asked
me
about
what
the
fbi
was
going
to
do
tomorrow,
and
i
can't
stand
here
and
tell
you
that,
but
the
senate
empaneled
a
select
committee
to
study
intelligence
operations--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--i
don't
know
what
the
senate
is
going
to
do
tomorrow,
but
i
do
know
that
the
senate
committee
found--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--i
do
know,
justice
marshall,
that
the
senate
found
that
the
fbi
did
terminate
its
conduct
and
its
misconduct
vis-a-vis
the
socialist
workers
party
and
its
candidates
and
its
party
members
in
1971.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
no.
the
fbi
has--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--justice
marshall,
i--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--that
is
correct.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
no,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
suggest
resumption
of
the
cointelpro
program,
which
was
the
fbi's
disruption
and
harassment
program,
which
was
specifically
addressed
to
the
socialist
workers
party,
directed
to
the
socialist
workers
party,
and
in
the
oregon
case
there
were
affidavits
submitted
by
the
fbi
which
said
that
they
had
discontinued
that
program.
since
that
time,
congress,
recognizing
that
the
fbi
and
other
intelligence
agencies
have
a
tendency
during
times
of
stress
in
this
country
to
get
out
of
hand,
has
enacted
legislation
which
will
further
preclude
the
probability,
not
the
possibility,
i
understand
that,
but
the
probability
of
future
programs
like
this
being
started
in
this
country.
so,
my
answer
is,
no,
i
can't
predict
what
is
possible,
but
i
can
predict,
justice
marhall,
what
is
probable,
and
it
is
not
probable--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--okay.
i'm
sorry.
in
our
case,
if
reference
to
the
fbi
and
the
multitude
of
its
real
or
alleged
improprieties
were
to
be
deleted
from
this
case,
it
is
our
position
that
there
would
be
nothing
left
of
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
appellees
in
the
district
court
but
a
small
collection
of
isolated
and
unrelated
incidents
of
verbal
and
illegal
physical
abuse
directed
toward
socialist
worker
party
members,
candidates,
and
party
headquarters
around
the
country,
along
with
a
very
limited
number
of
employment
terminations,
which
had
more
to
do
with
inappropriate
behavior
on
the
job
than
with
political
beliefs
or
even
political
conduct.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
in
certain
instances,
not
all
of
them.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
justice
o'connor,
there
is
not
one
thread
of
evidence
in
this
record
presented
by
the
appellees
which
showed
any
harassment
of
any
recipient
of
an
expenditure.
did
the
state
argue
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
two
categories,
and
say,
well,
maybe
you
have
evidence
going
to
contributors,
but
you
have
none
insofar
as
the
expenditure
requirement
is
concerned?
that
argument
was
made.
we
sort
of
got
caught
off
guard
by
the
trial
court's
decision
in
this
case.
we
thought
it
was
going
to
go
just
to
contributors.
the
trial
court's
decision,
the
injunction
decision
ultimately,
the
unconstitutionality
as
applied
decision
went
to
both
contributors
and
expenditures,
but
as
i
read
the
buckley
test,
the
buckley
case,
there
isn't
a
word
in
that
case
about
recipients
of
expenditures
being
exempted
from
the
disclosure
requirements
of
a
state
or
the
federal
statute.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
no,
i
don't
think
the
state's
interest
is
really
different.
ohio's
statute
is
not
exactly
like
the
federal
statute.
ohio
has
no
limitations
on
the
amount
that
can
be
contributed
to
any
given
candidate's
campaign.
ohio
did
not
originally
have
or
does
not
have
limitations
on
the
amount
of
expenditures
a
candidate
can
make.
ohio's
act
is
the
least
restrictive
means
of
regulating
the
electoral
process
in
this
manners,
justice
o'connor.
we
simply
say,
let
the
people
know
how
candidates
raise
their
money.
let
the
electorate
know
how
they
spend
their
money.
and
we
feel
that
will
deter
actual
corruption,
will
deter
the
appearance
of
corruption
and
impropriety,
and
will
give
the
electorate
an
informed
basis
upon
which
to
make
rational
judgments
at
the
ballot
box.
that
is
the
least
restrictive
means
available
to
regulate
this
area
of
the
electoral
process.
another
thing
about
the
evidence
presented
in
this
case,
it
certainly
doesn't
establish
that
there
is
any
causal
relationship
between
the
disclosure
requirement
from
which
the
appellees
seek
exemption
and
the
harassment
they
claim
will
occur
if
compliance
is
required.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
this
in
the
case.
obviously,
ohio's
disclosure
statute
is
supported
by
the
same
public
policy
arguments
as
which
supported
the
federal
campaign
election
act,
which
this
court
addressed
in
buckley
versus
valeo.
those
are
very,
very
important
public
interests,
and
the
ohio
statute
is
no
different
in
that
sense
from
the
federal
act,
and
this
court
was
asked
to
grant
blanket
exemptions
for
minority
parties
from
the
disclosure
provisions
of
the
federal
act,
and
this
court
did
not
see
fit
to
do
so.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
well,
as
i
read
the
buckley
test,
your
honor,
it
creates
a
very...
a
reasonably
loose
standard.
it
doesn't
only
go
to
harassment
which
could
be
caused
by
the
governments,
the
state
government.
it
also
goes
to
harassment
which
could
be
brought
forth
by
private
citizens,
for
example,
if
that
is
responsive
to
your
question.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
that's
correct,
and
the
burrells
case
in
1934.
the
major
distinction,
and
i
think
this
is
very
notable
and
should
be
brought
out
in
this
argument,
is,
naacp
versus
alabama
was
a
case
which
enunciated
a
general
first
amendment
principle.
however,
the
state
interest
underlying
or
involved
in
naacp
versus
alabama
was
in
no
measure
comparable
to
the
state
interest
involved
in
this
case
or
in
the
buckley
case.
it
was
a
mere
discovery
dispute
in
naacp
versus
alabama,
versus
a
piece
of
reform
legislation
directed
at
the
electoral
process
in
our
case
and
in
the
buckley
case.
there
is
a
very
important
distinction
there.
one
of
the
other
things
brought
out
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
buckely
case
which
we
would
like
to
address
is
the
discussion
of
a
minor
party's
impact
on
the
election
process
in
any
given
state.
this
court
said
that
a
minor
party's
impact
on
elections...
when
it
addressed
that
issue,
it
looked
to
whether
or
not
minor
parties
were
likely
to
win
in
any
given
election.
we
think
that
that
focus
is
a
little
bit
misdirected.
it
is
more
than
just
whether
or
not
a
minor
party
is
likely
to
win
an
election.
it
is
more...
the
true
question
concerns
a
minor
party's
potential
impact
on
the
outcome
of
any
given
election.
if
it
has
that
impact,
it
is
more
than
just
a
mere
minor
party
that
appears
on
the
ballot,
has
no
impact,
and
goes
away.
in
ohio,
for
example,
in
the
1974
gubernatorial
election,
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
nancy
brown
laser,
ran
for
governor
in
ohio
as
the
socialist
worker
party
candidates.
nancy
brown
laser
received
95,000
votes
in
ohio's
1974
gubernatorial
election.
jim
rhodes
beat
the
other
candidate,
the
other
major
party
candidate,
john
gilligan,
by
13,500
votes
in
ohio's
1974
gubernatorial
election.
obviously,
nancy
laser
had
a
very
important
impact
on
the
outcome
of
our
gubernatorial
election.
if
a
mere
12
percent
of
the
people
who
voted
for
this
minority
party
candidate,
12
percent
of
the
minority
party
candidate's
votes,
if
those
would
have
been
switched
to
john
gilligan,
he
would
have
been
governor
instead
of
jim
rhodes,
who
won
by
13,500
votes.
a
minor
party
can
have
more
impact
on
elections
than
just
winning
the
election.
we
think
that
is
an
important
thing
to
take
into
consideration
in
this
case.
another
example
of
that
is
the
ford-carter
presidential
race
in
1976.
in
ohio,
carter
beat
ford
by
11,000
votes,
and
yet
there
were
three
minority
groups
which
pulled
more
than
the
vote
differential
between
the
two
major
candidates.
mccarthy
got
58,000.
the
american
independent
candidate
got
16,000,
and
collectively,
the
other
independent
candidates
got

mr.
gary
elson
brown
and
the
revival
of
this
case?
mr.
gary
elson
brown
well,
it
was
a
1974
election,
and
this
case
was
filed
in
1974.
at
that
time,
there
was
a
tro
entered
which
did
not
allow
the
people
of
the
state
of
ohio
to
know
where
nancy
brown
laser's
money
was
coming
from.
now,
as
far
as
the
revival
of
the
case
in
1981,
it
is
six
years
later,
i
mean,
if
that
is
your
question,
justice
marshall.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
it
is
not
a
matter
of
connecting
so
much
as
a
matter
of
arguing
to
this
court
that
a
minority
party
is
more
than
just
a
winner
and
a
loser.
it
impacts
on
elections.
i
bring
that
example
out
to
show
you
that
it
did
it
in
ohio.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
that
is
basically
correct.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
i
don't
know
that
it
was
squarely
argued.
i
did
not
present
the
argument.
in
reviewing
the
case,
it
appears
that
the
appellees
requested
that
relief
and
the
state
of
ohio
disputed
it,
so
in
that
sense
i
think
it
was--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--there
were
post-trial
briefs
filed
in
this
case,
and
it
was
argued--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--yes.
it
was
argued
generally.
it
wasn't
argued
as
specifically
as
i
argued
it
in
this
reply
brief.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
in
the
post-trial
briefs
filed
after
the
trial,
yes,
that
was
generally
argued,
that
the
statute
is
neither
unconstitutional--
mr.
gary
elson
brown
--correct.
yes.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
that
is
the
trial
court's
burden.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
went
through
the
evidence
vis-a-vis
contributors,
and
at
the
end
of
the
trial
court
decision,
it
said,
based
upon
the
totality
of
the
evidence
adduced
at
trial,
we
conclude
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
swp
party,
both
vis-a-vis
contributions
and
expenditures.
there
was
no
independent
analysis
in
the
trial
court's
decision
on
expenditures,
justice
rehnquist.
the
quote
i
just
referred
to
appears
on
page...
appendix
page
a-29
of
our
jurisdictional
statement,
which
is
part
of
the
trial
court's
decision.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
i
may
have
missed
that,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
that's
right.
i
referred
to
the
court's
conclusion
where
it
found
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
no
determination
as
to
facial
validity?
mr.
gary
elson
brown
there
was
in
the
sense
that
the
appellees
in
this
case
in
their
complaint
asked
that
the
statute
be
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
and
the
trial
court
refused
to
do
that.
i
think
in
that
sense
there
was
a
finding
of
facial
unconstitutionality,
because
the
plaintiffs
had
asked
for
it,
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
it
is
not
referenced,
but
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
denied,
and
the
appellees
had
asked
for
it
in
their
complaint,
justice
blackmun.
one
of
the
other
points
we
want
to
make
in
our
oral
argument
is,
we
want
to
clear
up
a
misconception
contained
numerous
times
in
the
appellees'
brief
regarding
the
issue
of
anonymity.
anonymity
in
ohio
for
political
contributions
is
not
illegal.
it
is
not
a
dirty
word.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
recognized
in
our
campaign
reporting
act.
for
example,
revised
code
section
3517.13(f)
allows
up
to
$100
in
cash
contributions
to
be
given
to
any
particular
candidate.
there
is
no
prohibition
on
giving
these
anonymously.
revised
code
section
3517.10(b)(4)(e)
provides
for
the
giving
of
25
contributions
at
any
specific
social
or
fundraising
event,
and
again,
contrary
to
the
allegations
contained
in
the
appellees'
brief,
the
law
does
not
require
someone
to
attend
that
social
function
or
that
fundraising
event
merely
because
they
donated
the
$25.
so,
again,
there
is
another
example
of
anonymous
contributions.
and
thirdly,
and
perhaps
more
importantly,
revised
code
section
3517.10(c)
specifically
recognizes
anonymous
contributions
in
ohio
politics
and
details
how
they
are
to
be
reported
by
political
candidates.
your
honor,
i
see
a
light
is
on.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
five
minutes,
your
honors,
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court,
we
just
have
a
couple
of
brief
points
we
would
like
to
make
on
rebuttal
in
regard
to
two
specific
cases
which
have
been
previously
decided
in
this
country.
one
of
them
is
the
paul
young
case
involving
the
socialist
workers
party.
in
that
case,
the
soclialist
workers
party
lost.
the
district
court
required
the
socialist
workers
party
to
disclose
the
identity
of
its
contributors
and
the
recipients
of
its
expenditures,
yet
in
this
case,
the
swp
has
presented
no
evidence
of
any
harassment
in
oregon,
despite
the
fact
that
they
present
extensive
other
evidence
of
nationwide
problems
in
the
evidence
in
their
case.
again,
i
think
they
could
have
presented
direct
evidence
on
the
question
regarding
potential
harassment
of
contributors
or
expenditure
recipients
out
of
the
oregon
situation
if
there
had
been
any
harassment,
threats,
or
reprisals.
the
other
case
we
would
like
to
refer
to
briefly
is
the
fec
versus
hall
tiner
case,
which
mr.
buckley
just
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
his
letter
this
week.
that
case
involves
the
communist
party
rather
than
the
socialist
workers
party,
but
that
case
is
a
very
telling
case,
because
the
evidence
there
showed,
and
incidentally,
the
court
created
an
exemption
for
the
communist
party
in
the
fec
case,
and
the
evidence
in
that
case
showed
that
there
are
numerous
federal
statutes
currently
subjecting
members
of
the
communist
party
to
both
civil
disabilities
and
criminal
liability.
secondly,
membership
can
cause
a
naturalized
citizen
to
have
his
citizenship
revoked.
the
evidence
also
showed
that
in
many
states
it
is
currently
illegal
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
fourth,
contributors
to
the
communist
party
are
proscribed
by
many
state
statutes
throughout
the
country,
and
most
importantly,
there
was
evidence
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
by
the
assistant
director
of
the
fbi
that
even
though
the
cointelpro,
the
harassment
program
of
the
fbi,
even
though
the
cointelpro
program
was
terminated
in
1971,
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
is
currently
under
active
surveillance.
that
is
very
distinguishable
from
this
case,
where
the
government
has
testified
that
there
is
no
longer
any
cointelpro
programs
vis-a-vis
the
socialist
workers
party.
they
are
not
under
active
surveillance
in
this
country.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
justice
blackmun,
there
is
no
way
for
me
to
stand
here
and
say
there
is
a
definite
way
to
draw
that
time
line.
a
three-judge
panel
or
trial
court
or
this
court
has
to
bring
its
experience
to
bear
on
that
question,
but
last
week
is
a
far
cry,
ten
or
eleven
years
ago,
and
the
issue
coming
out
of
the
buckley
versus
valeo
test
is
the
future
reasonable
probability
that
disclosure
is
going
to
result
in
threats,
reprisals,
or
harassment.
if
it
just
ceased
last
week,
i
think
that
would
be
a
different
case
than
we
have
here,
where
it
ceased
eleven
years
ago.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
well,
like
i
say,
there
is
no
way
to
definitely
draw
the
line,
but
the
further
you
go
back
into
the
past,
the
less
likely
it
has
any
current
probative
value.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
i
don't
understand
about
have
to
be
unreasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
that's
correct.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
gary
elson
brown
if
it
was
three
years
ago,
i
would
stand
here
and
say
it
was
probably
still
unreasonable.
last
week,
i
would
be
much
less
prone
to
say
that.
your
honor,
in
closing,
i
think
clearly
in
consideration
of
this
matter,
the
district
court
incorrectly
applied
the
standards
set
forth
by
this
court
in
buckley
versus
valeo
by
failing
to
require
the
socialist
workers
party
to
properly
establish
that
a
reasonable
probability
in
the
future
of
threats,
reprisals,
or
harassment
to
contributors
or
recipients
of
expenditures
would
result
from
their
compliance
with
the
disclosure
requirements
of
our
statute.
thank
you,
your
honor.
