mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
about
the
right
to
exercise
first
amendment
freedom
of
association
by
contributing
to
the
socialist
workers
party
election
campaigns
in
ohio
without
having
the
fact
of
that
financial
association
or
tie
with
the
socialist
worker
party
candidates
disclosed
to
the
public.
the
three-judge
court
applied
the
law
for
the
cases
like
this
that
this
court
announced
in
1976
in
buckley
against
valeo,
and
found
that
under
the
first
amendment,
the
socialist
workers
party
campaigns
in
ohio
were
exempt
from
the
ohio
disclosure
law.
the
three-judge
court
found
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
compelled
disclosure
of
the
contributors'
names
would
lead
to
threats,
reprisals,
or
harassment
from
either
government
officials
or
private
parties.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
the
facts
in
this
case,
your
honor...
we
take
exception
to
the
attorney
general's
statement
of
the
facts
in
the
case.
the
attorney
general,
in
dealing
with
the
facts
in
the
case...
let
me
begin
with
the
most
recent
evidence
and
work
back.
in
the
one-year
period
before
trial,
the
record
shows
that
22
members
of
the
socialist
workers
party
were
fired
because
they
belonged
to
the
socialist
workers
party.
in
the
state
of
ohio,
four
people
lost
their
jobs
because
they
were
members
of
the
socialist
workers
party.
in
ohio,
there
were
about
60
socialist
workers
party
members.
if
you
translate
that
7
percent
into
major
party
proportions,
it
means
thousands
of
democrats,
thousands
of
republicans
would
lose
their
jobs
annually
in
ohio
on
account
of
their
political
associations.
we
showed
that
there
were
bullets
fired
at
a
socialist
workers
party
headquarters
while
people
were
exiting
from
a
speech
that
was
given
at
that
place.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
the
bullets,
your
honor,
were
in
pittsburgh,
not
in
ohio.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
your
honor,
the
evidence
from
other
states...
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
attitudes
in
ohio,
we
think,
are
any
less
hostile
towards
socialist
workers
party
adherents
than
they
are
anywhere
else.
we
had
in
ohio,
within
the
year,
a
threat
from
the
nazis
that
if
a
somewhat
similar
event
would
take
place
in
ohio,
the
nazis
would
be
there
and
they
would
kill
people.
now,
the
police
were
called
in,
and
there
was
no
violence,
but
that
event
in
ohio
took
place
under
police
protection.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
pittsburgh
is
about
50
or
60
miles
from
the
ohio
line,
justice
blackmun.
it
is
closer
to
cleveland
than
it
is
columbus,
where
this
case
was
tried.
there
were
other
incidents
in
the
last
year
as
well.
at
the
place
where
the
shots
were
fired,
people
scrawled
kkk
on
the
outside
of
the
socialist
workers
party
offices.
campaign
literature
was
first
turned
into
the
shape
of
a
cross
and
set
on
fire
and
a
candidate's
automobile
was
also
set
on
fire.
now,
with
respect
to
this
most
recent
evidence,
the
state
says
that
all
it
amounts
to
is
isolated,
unrelated
incidents,
as
if
these
things
were
bolts
out
of
the
blue
and
took
place
in
a
vacuum.
it
is
as
if
they
were
a
bunch
of
coincidences.
to
view
them
that
way
is
to
ignore
or
deny
that
hostility
to
communist
ideology
in
this
country
is
pervasive,
and
to
suggest
that
these
things
are
unusual
or
unrelated
denies
the
reality
of
the
attitudes
that
are
common
in
this
country.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--well,
some
of
the
presidents
have
lost
their
jobs,
too,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
the
causes
for
events
like
that...
when
the
shots
were
fired
at
the
socialist
workers
party
meeting
place,
there
wasn't
any...
no
one
prominent
in
that
sense
was
present.
the
fire
was
directed
at
people
whose
names
were
not
necessarily
known
to
anybody.
the
shots
were
fired
on
account
of
what
those
people
stood
for.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well
your
honor,
i
think
you
can
draw
the
inference
that
with
respect,
say,
to
the
abnormal
people,
they
are
going
to
be
directing
their
fire
at
people
such
as
the
socialist
workers
party
in
inordinate
numbers,
since
they
are--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--they
may
be
directing
their
fire
at
candidates
for
president,
or
presidents.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
these
people
aren't
leaders.
they
would
like
to
be
leaders,
but
they
receive
very
few
votes,
and
nevertheless
attract
plenty
of...
more
than
their
share,
if
we
were
to
look
at
it
that
way,
of
violence.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be
our
point.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
borne
out
by
the
record.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
the
targets
here
were
not
as
prominent
as
the
victims
of
those
republican
and
democratic
attacks,
those
major
party
victims.
they
were
nobodies
compared
to
people
who
were
attacked,
and
when
we...
the
violence
in
this
case,
i
have
only
described
the
violence
in
a
one-year
period,
only
the
violence
in
a
one-year
period.
there
is
more
violence
than
that.
that
was
just
the
one-year
period.
the
socialist
workers
party
offices
were
attacked
in
1978
in
chicago,
and
they
have
been
attacked
in
california,
san
diego
and
los
angeles
as
well.
the
state
says
that
the
evidence
from
before--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
none
at
all,
your
honor.
there
is
no
connection
between
the
disclosure
statute
and
knowing
where
the
socialist
workers
party
office
is
located.
when
it
comes
to
evidence
of
harassment
or
threats
or
reprisals
on
account
of
disclosure,
we
have
very
little
evidence
of
that.
the
reason...
we
have
some
evidence
from
1973,
after
1971,
when
harassment
was
supposed
to
have
stopped.
in
1973,
the
fbi
looked
up
and
found
out
that
some
individual
had
contributed
$10
to
a
socialist
workers
party
campaign,
had
displayed
a
poster
in
favor
of
the
socialist
workers
party
and
had
recommended
that
people
vote
either
for
the
socialist
workers
party
or
for
somebody
else.
the
fbi
confronted
that
person,
told
that
person
that
they
knew
what
he
was
up
to,
and
they
were
going
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
in
the
future.
the
reason
there
is
so
little
evidence,
direct
evidence,
is
that
there
hasn't
been
any
disclosure
to
speak
of.
there
has
been
no
disclosure
in
this
case,
and
the
socialist
workers
party
has
prevailed
in
six
courts
or
administrative
tribunals
around
the
country
when
they
have
made
the
same
sort
of
case
that
we
are
making
right
here.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
in
buckley
against
valeo,
we
think
that
that
opinion
invited
exactly
this
sort
of
a
lawsuit
to
be
brought
when
there
was
evidence
based
upon
past
or
present
harassment
of
members,
and
it
doesn't
require
that
there
be
a
direct
cause
and
effect
relationship.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
it
talks
about
flexibility
in
proof,
evidence
of--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--it
would
require
people
to
be
harassed,
to
expose
themselves
in
this
first
amendment
area
to
dangerous
consequences
on
account
of--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--well,
we
do
have
some
evidence
of
harassment,
that
1973
incident,
and
there
is
another
one
in
the
record
as
well
in
which
the
government
accounting
office
gave
people
some
trouble
when
they...
that
is
in
exhibit
129,
both
those
episodes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
the
clearly
erroneous
standard
applies
here,
your
honor.
this
is
a
factual
determination.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
if
names
are
disclosed,
it
will
subject
the
people
to
threats,
harassment,
or
reprisals.
it
is
a
probability.
whether
or
not
there
is
a
real
risk
involved
in
that...
in
making
disclosure.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
it
is
based
upon
historical
facts.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
it
is
not
just
a
foreboding.
on
account
of
historical
facts,
one
can
draw
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
reasonable
probability,
which
is
a
factual
determination.
and
that
is
what
the
three
judges
from
ohio
found
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--your
honor,
what
we--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--rule
52
says
that
the
findings
in
matters
like
this
of
the
trial
court
should
not
be
set
aside
unless
they
are
clearly
erroneous.
now,
the
record,
we
think,
is
so
powerful
and
overwhelming
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
conduct
the
trial
de
novo,
in
effect,
on
the
record
evidence,
this
court
would
verify
the
decision
that
the
trial
court
made,
but
rule
52,
the
pullman
standard
case
last
year,
we
think,
is
appropriate
and
applies
here.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
on
expenditures
either,
your
honor,
because
with
no
disclosure--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--there
is
none
at
all
on
expenditures
as
such,
but
in
that
connection,
we
think
that
the
considerations
when
it
comes
to
disclosure
of
who
gets
the
money,
where
the
disbursements
go,
are
very
similar
to
the
considerations
that
go
into
the
contributors'
names.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
the
case
of
peter
zenger
comes
to
mind
in
that
connection.
peter
zenger
was
a
printer,
not
a
politician,
and
peter
zenger
was
put
on
trial
on
account
of
what
appeared
in
that
journal
in
new
york.
so
that
is
a
good
example
of
where
campaign
money
goes.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
it
is
remote
in
time
and
place,
but
i
think
it
is
appropriate
nevertheless,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
a
good
deal
of
what
appeared
in
peter
zenger's
journal
was
published
anonymously.
it
appeared
as
advertisements
that
everybody
could
translate
into
the
politics
of
the
time,
and
the
people
who
published
anonymously
weren't
put
on
trial.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
i
wouldn't
see
that
that
is
any
greater
interest,
your
honor.
it
is
an
interest
that
one
can
discern,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
any
greater
than
the
interests
that
support
contribution
disclosures.
the
historical
evidence,
so-called.
the
state
says
that
the
evidence
that
the
fbi
stopped
harassment
of
the
socialist
workers
party
in
1971,
the
record...
i
have
already
referred
to
one
incident
in
the
record
from
1973,
when
the
fbi
harassed
somebody.
in
1976...
they
also
say
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
black
bag
jobs
by
the
fbi
stopped
in
1966.
there
is
evidence
in
our
record
of
a
burglary
committed
by
an
fbi
informant
on
a
socialist
workers
party
office
in
1976.
the
fbi
file
in
cleveland
comes
right
down
to
1978,
with
hostility
toward
the
socialist
workers
party,
evidence
from
the
1978
document.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
it
relied
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
it
does
not
mention
that,
your
honor.
it
says,
however,
that...
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
at
the
top
of
page
814,
it
says
that,
"the
political
views
of
the
swp
are
unpopular
with
many
americans,
and
plaintiffs
have
offered
substantial
evidence
of
both
governmental
and
private
hostility
toward
and
harassment
of
swp
members
and
supporters.
"
and
then
at
the
end
it
says
it
relies
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
the
first
sentence
that
i
read
is
the
preface
for
the
rest
of
the
few
pages
of
findings
of
fact,
where
there
are
specific
references.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--it's...
let
me
answer
you
this
way,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
there
is
an
inference
that
federal
hostility
toward
the
socialist
workers
party
continues.
the
fbi
announced
in
1976
that
its
internal
security
investigation
of
the
socialist
workers
party
was
at
an
end,
the
internal
security
aspects
of
it.
the
record
is
filled
with
references
to
other
u.s.
federal
agencies
who
have
had
a
long-standing
interest
in
the
socialist
workers
party.
the
military
intelligence
agencies.
the
defense
supply
construction
center,
part
of
the
military
intelligence.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
the
secret
service.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
ever
stopped.
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
continue,
either,
but
one
would
have
thought
since
the
fbi
made
an
announcement
that
it
was
closing
down
its
investigation
in
1976
that
there
would
be
a
similar
announcement
with
respect
to
other
agencies.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
the
record
shows
that
they
were
investigating,
they
had
an
interest
and
were
investigating
the
socialist
workers
party,
and
the
evidence
comes
all
the
way
down
to
the
fall...
to
a
few
months
before
trial,
actually.
the
u.s.
navy
caused
three
of
the
firings
to
take
place
in
new
york.
so
that
was
federal
hostility
within
a
few
months
of
the
trial,
in
new
york.
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
in
the
record
as
well
with
respect
to
private
hostility
toward
the
socialist
workers
party.
some
of
the
firings
were
obviously
the
result
of
private
hostility.
there
is
also
evidence
that
people
would
contact...
voluntarily
contact
the
fbi
and
volunteer
their
services
as
informants.
there
is
evidence
that
the
fbi
was
able
to
recruit
a
network
of
contacts
at
21
colleges
and
universities
in
the
vicinity
of
cleveland
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
socialist
workers
party
to
see
what
they
were
doing
and
were
not
doing.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
might
theoretically
be
possible.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
the
circumstances
in
which
that
would
take
place.
in
buckley,
the
court
said
that
minor
parties
could
get
an
exemption.
now,
there
are
places
and
circumstances,
i
suppose,
in
which
a
democrat
hasn't
won
or
a
republican
hasn't
won
in
100
years,
and
perhaps
one
could
generate
out
of
that
sort
of
background
a
minor
party
characterization.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
justice
blackmun,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--that
was
a
republican.
the
republicans
were
the
people
whose
campaign
contributions
would
have
been
revealed
in
pollard
against
roberts
were
it
not
for
the
decision
in
pollard
against
roberts.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
let
me
explain
why
this
case
took
so
long
to
get
here.
it
was
filed
in
1974.
the
parties
gave
the
temporary
restraining
order
class-wide
effect
throughout.
it
was
by
agreement
of
the
parties.
the
thing
on
file
was
a
temporary
restraining
order.
the
parties
gave
it
a
class-wide
effect.
but
the
reason
why
it
was
delayed
was
because
buckley
against
valeo
was
in
the...
was
working
its
way
up
toward
the
supreme
court,
and
there
was
then
a
lengthy
battle
with
the
fbi
over
discovery
of
the
fbi
records
from
cleveland.
after
those
records
were
finally
revealed
in
a
highly
excised
form,
we
stopped
fighting
the
fbi
and
took
what
they
gave
us
in
that
excised
form
and
moved
forward
fairly
promptly
toward
trial.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
the
people
who
are
connected
with
the
socialist
workers
party
have
been
subjected
to
threats,
harassment,
and
reprisals
in
the
past
and
right
down
to
the
time
of
trial
from
government
sources
and
from
private
sources.
this
is
exactly
the
sort
of
evidence
that
the
court
in
buckley
against
valeo
said
would
be
necessary
for
a
minor
party
to
qualify
for
an
exemption
from
a
campaign
disclosure
law.
this
is
also
exactly
the
sort
of
evidence
about
the
dangers
of
being
associated
with
the
socialist
workers
party
which
establishes
that
it
is
dangerous
to
have
your
name
identified
as
a
person
to
whom
an
expenditure
has
been
made.
people
who
receive
expenditures,
not
only
printers,
but
landlords,
other
such
people,
are
just
as
apt...
the
inference
seems
just
so
perfectly
natural.
they
are
just
as
apt
to
be
harassed
on
that
account
as
are
people
who
make
contributions.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
but,
your
honor,
the
people
who
become
landlords
for
the
socialist
workers
party
deliberately
choose
to
deal
with
them,
and
they
might
very
well
not
want
it
to
be
known
that
that
is
where
they
were
making
their
money.
the
same
for
the
printers.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
i
suggest
that
it
would
be
harmful
to
many
people
if
it
were
known
that
they
were
making
their
money
by
dealing
with
the
marxist
ideologists.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
we
have
no
evidence,
your
honor,
that
the
hilton--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--we
do
have
evidence,
not
about
the
hilton,
your
honor,
but
that
the
fbi
did
harass
swp
landlords
in
the
past,
not
because
they
were
discovered
to
be
landlords
on
account
of
the
disclosure
laws,
but
because
the
found
it
out
some
other
way,
and
they
discovered
that
neighbors
and
friends
were--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--it
is
a
party's
interest,
your
honor,
but
there
are
other
kinds
of--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--the
socialist
workers
party,
their
contributors,
and
people
who
have
received--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
when
it
comes
to--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--there
are
other
kinds...
even
with
respect
to--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--it
would
deter
such
people,
your
honor,
but
there
are
other
kinds
of
recipients
as
well.
i've
got
exhibit
f
from
the
record
here.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
you
would
reduce
the
number
of
printers,
your
honor.
i
think
that
seems
quite...
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
number
of
printers
that
would
be
available...
this
shows
other
kinds
of
recipients
of
funds,
not
in
the
order
of
magnitude
of
landlords
and
printers.
it
shows
people
getting
$20,
$7,
$23,
amounts
like
that
to
pay
for
xerox,
postage,
such
things
as
that.
these
are
the
people
who
do
the
legwork
for
the
campaign,
little
people.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
well,
you
pay
somebody
to
go
and
buy
that,
your
honor,
and
that
is
what...
you
have
to
say,
to
whom
paid,
and
the
purpose
of
the
expenditure.
now,
there
are
other
people--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the...
it
says
here...
there
are
other
people
who
are
named
here.
central
national
bank
is
listed
as
a
recipient
for
service
charges.
other
sorts
of
recipients
would
be
people
whose
carfare
was
reimbursed.
expenses
in
connection
with
the
campaign
such
as
that.
in
buckley,
this
court
suggested
that
one
could
qualify
for
an
exemption
from
disclosure
if
the
party
came
forward
with
proof
similar
to
the
proof
in
naacp
against
alabama.
our
case
is
very
similar
to
naacp
against
alabama.
there
was
violence
against
people
in
naacp
against
alabama,
and
it
was
violence
principally,
not
exclusively,
against
leaders
in
the
naacp.
reverend
shuttlesworth
is
mentioned
twice.
martin
luther
king
is
mentioned.
another
person
who
is
not
famous
but
who
had
made
speeches
is
mentioned
by
name
as
having
been
assaulted.
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
there
was
evidence
of
government
hostility
in
the
state
of
alabama.
there
is
evidence
of
government
hostility
in
this
case,
and
there
was
some
evidence--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--very
little,
your
honor,
but
there
is
some.
the
lieutenant
governor
made
a
request
to
the
fbi
in
one
situation
about
a
member
of
the
young
socialist
alliance,
and
it
shows
at
another
point
that
the
fbi
was
working
with
the
cleveland
police
department,
but
there
isn't
that
much.
and
in
naacp,
there
is
some
evidence,
but
not
as
much
evidence
as
there
is
in
this
case,
of
economic
reprisal.
when
it
comes
to
people
being
fired
we
have
in
this
case
a
substantial
amount
of
evidence
coming
right
down
to
the
time
of
trial,
and
the
cases
are
quite
comparable.
in
my
remaining
minutes,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
one
other
argument
that
is
in
the
appellant's
brief,
the
nominating
petition
argument,
so-called.
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
ohio,
socialist
workers
party
candidates
have
to
collect
signatures
on
nominating
petition--
mr.
thomas
d.
buckley,
jr.
--thank
you.
