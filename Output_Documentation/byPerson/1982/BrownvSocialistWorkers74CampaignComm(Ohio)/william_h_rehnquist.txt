justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
clearly
a
violation
of
civil
rules,
if
you
would
want
to
challenge
it.
you
can't
enter
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
say
it
extends
for
months
and
months.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
done
at
the
behest
of
opposing
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
brown,
do
you
think
the
language
in
buckley
is
addressed
to
any
sort
of
harassment
or
bothering
that
might
result
from
the
fact
of
disclosure
of
persons
of
the
statute
or
is
it
addressed
more
particularly
to
harassment
that
would
be
perpetrated
by
the
entity,
governmental
entity
requiring
disclosure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
the
buckley
statement
as
i
read
it
is
based
on
some
of
the
earlier
cases
like
naacp
versus
alabama,
and
naacp
versus
button.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
at
the
trial
stage,
where
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiffs
to
prove
each
and
every
element
of
their
complaint,
and
they
are
seeking
to
strike
down
two
different
statutory
sections,
i
suppose
the
burden
is
on
the
trial
court
if
he
is
going
to
find
for
the
plaintiffs
to
consider
whether
each
one
of
those
sections
is
unconstitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
law
is
presumed
constitutional
until
someone
presents
a
sufficient
case
to
convince
the
court
that
it
isn't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
in
ohio?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
evidence
in
other
states
is
uniformly
transferrable
to
ohio?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
point
would
be,
i
suppose,
that
they
attract
more
violence
than
similarly
situated
republicans
and
democrats.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
buckley,
the
offices,
i
take
it,
would
be
attacked
quite
apart
from
any
disclosure
requirement.
i
mean,
there
is
a
certain...
a
party
chooses
to
make
itself
public
in
a
certain
sense,
open
streetfront
offices,
campaign
headquarters,
and
it
doesn't
require
any
statutory
disclosure
for
people
to
know
if
you
are
conducting
any
sort
of
a
campaign
to
know
where
your
campaign
headquarters
are.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
in
a
sense,
it
was
something
that
you
brought
about
yourself.
i
mean,
if
you
had
wanted
evidence
and
thought
it
would
be
forthcoming
by
application
of
the
disclosure
statute,
you
could
have
refrained
from
asking
for
the
temporary
restraining
order
over
a
period
of
six
years.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
it
doesn't
require
it
to
be
a
direct
cause
and
effect
relationship?
is
there
anything
in
buckley
against
valeo
that
says
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
still
doesn't
go
to
what
it
is
you
are
trying
to
prove.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
you
produce
evidence
of
harassment
other
than
showing
that
somewhere
there
has
been
the
fact
of
harassment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
even
you
concede
that
the
case
of
peter
zenger
is
somewhat
remote
in
time
and
place,
though?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
rely
on,
for
instance,
the
1978
document?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
mentions
several
pieces
of
evidence
specifically,
as
i
recall.
did
it
mention
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
buckley,
supposing
that
in
a
presidential
year,
there
is
a
very
hotly
fought
battle
between
the
republican
candidate
and
the
democratic
candidate
for
president,
and
let's
say
in
a
particular
congressional
district
in
ohio
the
thing
is
even
more
hot,
and
it
is
just
a
very
bitter,
hostile
rivalry,
with
a
lot
of
rock-throwing,
things
you
don't
ordinarily
see
in
strictly
major
party
campaigns,
but
this
is
a
little
bit
different.
do
you
suppose
that
either
the
republican
candidate
or
the
democratic
candidate
or
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
could
come
in
and
make
a
showing
under
those
circumstances
that
they
ought
not
to
be
required
to
disclose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow,
does
it,
counsel?
wouldn't
some
people
feel
differently
about
someone
who
took
a
printing
job
from
the
socialist
workers
party
as
simply
a
commercial
deal,
or
a
landlord
who
rented
premises
to
them,
that
he
was
in
the
business
of
renting
to
anyone
who
came
along,
as
opposed
to
someone
who
voluntarily
contributed?
he
wasn't
in
the
business
of
contributing.
he
chose
the
socialist
workers
party.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
any
landlord
deliberately
chooses,
but
do
you
think
it
is
exactly
the
same
sort
of
choice
as
making
a
voluntary
contribution
to
a
political
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
do
you
pay
to
get
the
postage?
the
united
states
post
office,
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
buy
stamps
through
a
middleman?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
evidence
of
hostility
from
the
state
of
ohio?
