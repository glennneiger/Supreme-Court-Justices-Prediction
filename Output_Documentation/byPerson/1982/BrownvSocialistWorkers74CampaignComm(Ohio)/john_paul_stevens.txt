justice
john
paul
stevens
general
brown,
you
mentioned
the
age
of
the
evidence.
the
opinion
indicates
the
temporary
restraining
order
had
been
filed
on
something
like
february
7th,
1975.
the
case
wasn't
tried
until...
am
i
correct
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happened
during
those
six
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
just
like
any
lawsuit,
i
hope.
six
years
with
a
tro
outstanding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
they
even
convert
it
to
a
preliminary
injunction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
gave
them
total
relief
for
six
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
the
state
really
couldn't
have
been
terribly
upset
about
it,
if
they
let
it
sit
for
six
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
it
is
upset.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
the
character
of
that
order
might
have
some
relationship
to
the
fact
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
threats
or
harassment
since
1975,
or
the
people
would
be
in
contempt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
brown,
may
i
follow
up
on
a
question
justice
o'connor
asked
you
a
bit
ago
about
the
difference
between
the
disclosure
requirement
with
respect
to
contributions
on
the
one
hand
and
expenditures
on
the
other?
in
your
reply
brief,
you
say
there
is
nothing
to
support
the
order
insofar
as
it
relates
to
expenditures,
as
i
understand
the
second
point
of
your
reply
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
didn't
understand
you
to
make
that
argument
in
your
opening
brief,
and
i
am
just
wondering,
was
that
squarely
argued
to
the
district
court,
that
distinction
between
the
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
they
dispute
it
in
the
sense
of
saying,
there
isn't
enough
evidence
to
support
any
relief,
and
over
and
above
that,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
on
the
expenditure
part
of
it,
which
seems
to
me
might
well
have
been
argued
below.
i
am
just...
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
force
to
your
argument,
but
i
am
just
wondering
if
the
district
court
had
a
fair
opportunity
to--
--well,
were
there
trial
briefs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
reply
brief
it
is
set
out
very--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
there
is
a
stronger
statement
on
a-27,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
finding
itself
relates
only
to
contributions.
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
cited
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
that
it
establishes
in
ohio
public
disclosure
that
a
person
is
a
member
of
or
has
made
a
contribution
which
create
a
reasonable
probability
of
harassment.
but
there
is
nothing
about
expenditures.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
wasn't
doing
commercial
printing,
either.
he
was
printing
things
he
wanted
to
say,
was
he
not?
i
mean,
i
assume
your
client
is
going
to
go
out
and
hire
some
printer
or
some
billboard
or
some
office
or
something
like
that.
i
am
not
sure
they
are
all
in
the
same
class
as
peter
zenger.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
hilton
hotel
rented
a
room
for
a
meeting.
do
you
think
they
would
get
bombed
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
exactly
the
point.
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other.
