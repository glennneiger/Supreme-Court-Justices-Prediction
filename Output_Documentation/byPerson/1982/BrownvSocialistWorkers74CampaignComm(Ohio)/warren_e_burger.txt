chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
brown
against
the
socialist
workers
campaign
committee.
mr.
brown,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
record
that
suggests
any
resumption
of
that
kind
of
activity
over
the
last
ten
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
buckley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
evidence
is
there
in
the
record
to
support
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record?
don't
disturb
your
argument.
let
us
know
later.
let
me
know
later.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
appropriate
to
draw
any
inferences
or
base
findings
on
the
proposition
that
within,
i
guess,
about
five
years
or
six
three
presidents
have
been
either
shot
or
shot
at?
two
of
them
shot
at,
or
attempted
assaults
on
them
with
firearms,
and
one
actually
struck.
i
am
just
wondering.
can
we
draw
any
inferences
from
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
is
there
a
general
inference
that
there
are
a
certain
percentage
of
abnormal
people
in
a
large
country
like
this
who
will
do
abnormal
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
putting
my
question
to
you
about
three
attempts
on
presidents'
lives
in
just
recent
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you
suppose
the
efforts
were
made
on
three
occasions...
if
you
go
back
20
years,
it
would
be
five
or
six
occasions...
on
presidents
and
presidential
candidates?
can
you
really
draw
an
inference
from
that
except
that
there
is
a
certain
percentage
of
abnormal
people
at
large?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
candidates
for
president.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
to
leaders
of
other
kinds,
leaders
of
groups
which
some
abnormal
people
find
objectionable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
is
hardly
borne
out
by
the
records,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
three
attempts
on
republican
presidents
and
successful
activities
towards
the
democratic
candidates
and
one
president.
frankly,
you
lose
me
on
your
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
they
haven't
been
engaging
in
any
such
activity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
counsel.
you
may
continue,
mr.
buckley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
buckley.
you
have
covered
that
in
your
brief,
i
am
sure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
brown?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgments
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
brown
against
the
socialist
workers
campaign
committee
of
ohio
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you,
justice
