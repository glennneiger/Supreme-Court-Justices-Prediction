justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
just
a
factual
argument
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
claim
the
court
used
the
wrong
standard,
legal
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
question
then,
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
we
independently
arrive
at
it,
or
do
we
have
to
find
that
the
court
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
says,
concludes,
i
infer
from
these
historical
facts
which
he
has
found,
which
you
don't
dispute,
or
nobody
disputes
about,
i
infer
or
predict
that
there
would
be
reprisal
or
some
injury
in
the
future
if
there
is
disclosure.
now,
you
say
that
is
not
a
factual
finding.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
a
finding.
he
says,
i
find
that
there
would
be
injury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
bottom
line
findings
that
are
still
facts.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
any
such
finding
as
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
ever
challenged
on
that
ground,
that
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
improperly--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
have
them.
was
it
argued
in
the
briefs?
justice
byron
r.
white
--post-trial
before
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
we
could...
well,
what
do
you
think
our
standard
of
review
is
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
factual
determination,
that
there
will...
it
is
a
prediction?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
certainly
isn't
a
historical
fact
finding.
i
mean,
that
is
about
the
future.
it
is
a
prediction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be.
it
is
an
inference
about
what
will
happen
in
the
future
from
historical
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
we
can't
disagree
with
the
inferences
the
three-judge
court
drew
unless
we
find
the
inference
is
clearly
erroneous.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
can't
make
an...
you
submit
that
we
can't
make
an
independent
judgment--
justice
byron
r.
white
--based
on
the
historical
facts
as
to
what
the
future
might
hold.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
argument
about
contributors,
though,
is
that
the
socialist
workers
party
will
be
damaged
because
contributors
will
be
put
off.
you
won't
get
your
contributions.
isn't
that
right?
this
is
the
party's
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
whose
interests
are
you
representing
here,
the
socialist
workers
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
their
contributors,
but
the
only
reason
you
can
represent
the
contributors
is
because
it
might
cool
them
off
to
have
their
names
disclosed.
do
you
think
there
is
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
expenditures,
that
the
party
won't
be
able
to
find
people
to
take
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
can't
find
a
landlord,
or
you
can't
find...
of
course,
everybody
is
going
to
know
who
your
landlord
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
rent
a
hotel
room?
you
can't
find
any
secretaries
to
work
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
printers?
you
can't
find
a
printer
to
print
for
you?
because
they
may
be
harassed?
