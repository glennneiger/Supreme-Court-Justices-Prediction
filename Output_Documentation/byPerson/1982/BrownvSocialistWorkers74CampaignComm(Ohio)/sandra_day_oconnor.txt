justice

o'connor
mr.
brown,
the
ohio
statute
requires
two
things,
as
i
understand
it,
one
a
disclosure
of
contributions,
contributors,
names
of
contributors--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
secondly,
disclosure
of
payment
of
expenditures
to
other
people.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
about
the
effect
of
requiring
disclosure
of
the
payments
of
expenditures
to
others,
as
opposed
to
evidence
of
harassment
of
members
of
the
party,
which
presumably
might
include
contributors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
state's
interest
is
different
as
between
disclosure
of
expenditures
and
disclosure
of
contributors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
buckley,
was
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
effect
on
disclosure
of
expenditures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
some
limited
evidence,
is
your
argument,
as
to
the
effect
on
contributors,
but
is
there
any
at
all
on
the
expenditures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
they
are
really
quite
different?
for
instance,
there
might
be
a
disclosure
of
expenditure
of
where
you
get
printing
done?
don't
you
think
it
is
much
less
likely
that
there
would
be
harassment
of
a
commercial
printer
who
was
paid
to
do
a
job
than
there
would
be
of
a
contributor
to
a
cause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
buckley,
would
you
concede
that
the
state
might
have
conceivably
even
a
greater
interest
in
requiring
disclosure
of
expenditures
than
contributions
in
an
effort
to
discourage
the
payment
of
bribes
or
buying
votes,
or
something
of
that
kind?
