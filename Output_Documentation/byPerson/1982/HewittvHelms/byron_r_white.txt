justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
good
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
fishman,
was
there
a
written
summary
of
the
hearing
on
december,
what
was
it,
8th,
december
8th?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
printed
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
thank
you
very
much.
and
is
that
same
true
of
the
january
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
i'll
find
it.
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
is
it
critical
to
your
case
that
the
physical
conditions
of
confinement
for
a
person
in
administrative
custody
be
both
as
severe
as
those
for
a
disciplinary
confinement
and
also
significantly
different
from
one
in
the
general
population?
the
reason
i
ask
that
is,
as
i
understand
the
government's
brief,
they
say
in
the
federal
system
to
which
you
just
referred
the
administrative
confinement
is
very
much
like
the
general
population.
would
you
say
you'd
have
the
same
claim
in
those
conditions?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
on
behalf
of
anybody
else.
oh,
yes
it
does.
