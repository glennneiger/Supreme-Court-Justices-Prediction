justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you
explain,
though,
what's
the
difference
between
the
two
charges?
they're
both
for
assaulting.
they
were
just
different
guards
at
the
same
riot?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
same
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
it
really
related
to
the
same
incident
and
the
second
one
was
just
merely
more
specific
in
identifying
the
particular
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
first
one
related
to
a
different
correctional
officer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
i'm
sorry,
but
i'd
like
to
interrupt
you,
if
i
may,
once
more
on
these
two
charges,
because
the
chief
justice's
question
concerned
me.
the
second
one,
i'm
just
looking
at
it,
says
misconduct
date,
january
1979.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
the
charge
itself
says,
misconduct
date,
1/19/79.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
it
says.
page
41a
of
the
record,
of
your
appendix,
joint
appendix.
whereas
the
earlier
one
says,
misconduct
date,
12/3/78,
which
was
the
date
of
the
riot.
so
i
wonder
if...
the
chief
justice
had
suggested
that
it
was
while
he
was
in
detention,
and
i
guess
that
seems
to
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
earlier
one
uses
the
term
"misconduct
date"
to
refer
to
the
date
of
the
riot.
look
at
37a.
is
it
quite
clear
that
this
is
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--see,
he
was
given
the
charge
on
the
4th
and
it
refers
to
the
misconduct
date
as
the
3rd.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
made
me
think
that
the
later
one,
when
it
says
misconduct
date
january
19,
probably
meant
what
it
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt.
thank
you
for
clearing
it
up,
because
it's
just
confusing.
incidentally,
mr.
attorney
general,
the
formal
criminal
charges
were
dropped?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
just
ask,
is
it
your
view
that
since
there's
no
liberty
interest
at
all
and
since
administrative
custody
is
physically
the
same
as
disciplinary
custody,
that
without
giving
any
hearing
whatsoever
an
inmate
could
be
put
in
administrative
custody
for
the
entire
period
of
his
confinement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
raises
in
my
mind?
as
i
remember
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
there
was
some
discussion
of
the
fact
that
the
evidence
adduced
against
him
was
this
anonymous
witness,
i
mean,
the
officer
reported
an
anonymous
report,
and
that's
all
there
was,
and
that
that
was
not
sufficient
as
a
constitutional
matter.
didn't
the
third
circuit
so
hold?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
isn't
it
true
that
your
damage
proceeding
is
going
to
go
forward
on
that
issue
no
matter
what
we
do
with
this
other
issue?
i
just
wonder,
how
much
bearing
does
this
issue
we're
discussing
today
have
on
the
hearing
that
you
contemplate,
which
i
gather
will
take
place
no
matter
what
we
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that.
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
also
argue
that,
even
if
they
changed
all
the
labels
and
made
everything
administrative
and
gave
you
no
hearings
at
all...
and
your
opponent,
of
course,
says
they
could
do
that.
but
your
objection
is
largely,
as
i
understand
it...
would
also
be
based
on
the
fact
that
there's
a
significant
physical
difference
in
the
character
of
the
custody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
not
contend,
if
i
understand
your
argument
correctly,
that
it
amounted
to
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
but
that's
because
the
state
hasn't
challenged
the
holding
that
it
was
insufficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
we
know
whether
it
was
a
corrections
officer?
your
opponent
said
there
was
a
corrections
officer
testified.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
clarify?
which
hearing
was
it
that
the
inmate
had
the
witness
testify
at?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
december
8th.
because
the
january
22nd
hearing,
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
one
insufficient.
and
i'm
correct
in
recalling,
you
don't
challenge
that
determination?
