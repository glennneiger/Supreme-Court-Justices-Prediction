justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meanwhile,
mr.
attorney
general,
i
gather
he
was
in
administrative
custody
and
confined
as
such,
wasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
how
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
january
22nd
is
what,
after
the
final
hearing
he
had?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
he
changed
after
january
22nd
from
administrative
custody
to
disciplinary
custody?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
difference
between
disciplinary
and
administrative
custody
in
terms
of
what
the
prisoner
experiences?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
either
case
he's
treated
the
same
way,
isn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
the
conditions
of
administrative
confinement
differ
from
the
conditions
of
disciplinary
confinement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
the
only
difference?
i
mean,
you've
just
been
telling
us
that
in
disciplinary
confinement
the
prisoner
may
not
even
speak
in
a
normal
tone
of
voice.
is
that
true
if
he
were
in
administrative
confinement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
he's
in
administrative
confinement,
he
has
only
ten
minutes
a
day
for
exercise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
no
showers
available?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there's
just
no
difference
in
that
as
to
confinement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
administrative
or
disciplinary,
it's
the
same
thing,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
he's
now
on
parole?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
contemplate
would
happen
in
the
further
proceedings
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
directed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
1983?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be
the
51
days,
would
it?
