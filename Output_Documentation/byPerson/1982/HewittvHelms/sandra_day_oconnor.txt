justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
zimmerman,
would
you
tell
us
what
section
of
the
pennsylvania
code,
or
sections,
you
believe
governed
the
proceedings
in
this
instance
against
the
prisoner?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
the
pennsylvania
courts
interpreted
the
section
95.104(b)(3)
to
mean
that
administrative
custody
may
be
maintained
so
long
as
there
has
been
no
determination
on
the
misconduct
charge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
the
only
differences
in
the
administrative
custody
and
the
disciplinary
custody
the
effect
on
parole
status
and
pre-release
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
assert
that
administrative
custody
does
affect
the
parole
release?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
qualifier
there,
that
if
no
behavior
violation
has
occurred
he
is
to
be
released?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
your
position
that
"if
no
behavior
violation
has
occurred.
"
is
not
a
predicate
to
the
release
within
ten
days
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
no
pennsylvania
case
so
holding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
clarify
again
how
administrative
custody
affects
parole
or
pre-release?
i
don't
think
i
understood
your
statement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
has
an
indirect
effect.
