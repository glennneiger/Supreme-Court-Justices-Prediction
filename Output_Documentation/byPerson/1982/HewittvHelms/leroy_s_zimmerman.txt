mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
issue
of
whether
regulations
promulgated
by
pennsylvania's
prison
authorities
create
the
expectation
of
a
liberty
interest
in
prisoners,
requiring
due
process
before
a
prisoner
can
be
transferred
from
general
population
to
administrative
segregation
pending
the
completion
of
an
investigation
into
a
riot
at
the
state
prison
in
huntington,
pennsylvania.
on
december
3rd,
1978,
a
group
of
inmates
attempted
to
force
their
way
into
the
control
center
of
the
institution.
a
riot
ensued.
several
guards
were
injured.
it
was
necessary
to
call
upon
the
pennsylvania
state
police,
local
law
enforcement
agencies,
and
additional
corrections
personnel
to
quell
the
disturbance.
the
prison
authorities
immediately
initiated
an
investigation.
they
segregated
the
suspected
participants
and
attempted
to
restore
order
to
the
institution.
the
respondent
was
one
of
18
inmates
suspected
of
direct
involvement
in
the
riot
and
of
assaulting
corrections
officers.
the
following
day,
december
4,
1978,
the
respondent
was
given
a
copy
of
a
misconduct
report
charging
him
with
the
assault
on
officers
and
conspiracy
to
disrupt
prison
operations
by
attempting
to
take
over
the
institution's
control
center.
on
december
8,
1978,
he
was
given
a
hearing,
at
which
he
appeared,
and
it
was
determined
that
the
investigation
was
incomplete,
that
he
should
remain
in
administrative
segregation
pending
the
completion
of
the
investigation,
and
a
further
review
of
his
status
was
scheduled
for
january
2nd,
1979.
on
that
day,
respondent
was
present
at
a
hearing
before
the
program
review
committee,
where
it
was
decided
that
his
status
should
remain
unchanged
pending
completion
of
the
ongoing
investigation
by
the
pennsylvania
state
police.
on
january
19,
1979,
the
respondent
was
charged
specifically
with
a
second
misdemeanor
in
connection
with
an
assault
upon
sergeant
phillips,
a
corrections
officer,
on
december
3rd,
1978.
within
three
days,
on
january
22nd,
1979,
he
was
given
a
hearing,
at
which
he
was
present,
and
determined
to
be
guilty
of
the
second
misconduct
charge
and
thereby
confined
to
disciplinary
segregation
for
a
period
of
six
months.
the
sources
of
a
liberty
interest
are
our
fourteenth
amendment,
which
protects
life,
liberty
and
property,
and
in
this
particular
case
we
focus
on
liberty.
the
cases
of
meachum
and
montanye
support
our
pennsylvania
position
that
administrative
custody
is
within
the
normal
range
of
a
lawful
conviction
and
sentence.
the
residue
of
liberty
in
the
inmate
after
a
lawful
conviction
and
a
lawful
sentence
does
not
include
any
right
to
remain
in
the
general
population
of
the
prison.
the
fact
that
changes
are
adverse
to
an
inmate
does
not
give
that
inmate
a
right
to
due
process.
a
liberty
interest
can
be
created
by
statute
or
by
regulation.
we
focus
on
regulation
in
this
particular
case.
to
create
that
liberty
interest,
there
must
be
a
clear
and
explicit
and
direct
mutual
expectation
that
a
liberty
interest
is
to
be
created,
and
the
state
must
be
bound
to
do
or
to
refrain
from
doing
something
that
can
be
determined
by
objective
standards.
prison
authorities
must
have
the
latitude
to
exercise
discretion
in
carrying
out
their
duties
and
responsibilities
inside
these
prisons.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
your
honor,
the
relevant
sections,
we
believe,
are
first
section
107...
107
appears
at
page
46
of
our
brief.
107
is
a
general
policy
statement
of
when
to
use
administrative
custody.
in
order
that
the
prisons
remain
safe,
the
officials
must
have
the
discretion
and
the
latitude
to
segregate
inmates
in
order
to
maintain
that
security
and
safety.
there
are
times,
and
the
list
is
contained
in
95.107,
where
an
individual
who
poses
a
threat
to
other
inmates
must
be
segregated,
or
a
threat
to
staff,
or
to
himself,
or
he
poses
an
escape
risk,
or
he
needs
protection
himself
from
other
inmates.
now,
i
think
that
107
is
the
first
section
that's
relevant
here
in
our
inquiry.
but
then,
of
course,
it's
necessary
to
go
to
section
95.104(b)(3),
which
is
page
43
of
our
brief.
and
that
too
represents
a
policy
statement
for
when
to
use
administrative
custody,
for
investigations.
and
that
was
the
focus
in
this
particular
case.
there
was
an
investigation
under
way.
the
court
said
that
prison
society
is
different
from
society
at
large--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--your
honor,
in
hughes
v.
rowe,
in
reading
the
case
the
key
unclear
point
was
the
effect
of
administrative
segregation
in
those
regulations
in
that
case.
one
opinion
noted
that
the
administrative
segregation
appeared
to
result
in
a
loss
of
good
time,
which
certainly
we
would
then
concede
puts
it
within
wolff.
however,
if
the
record
does
not
reflect
any
serious
security
problem
or
if
that
administrative
segregation...
and
this
is
hughes,
in
my
opinion...
administrative
segregation
was
for
investigative
purposes,
we
feel
that
it's
in
that
sense
similar
to
our
case.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
your
honor,
the
respondent
was
given
a
notice
of
his
charge
on
december
4,
1978,
the
next
day,
and
a
hearing
on
december
8,
1978,
within
six
days.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
our
regulations
in
pennsylvania
provide
that
an
inmate
has
the
opportunity
to
be
present,
to
call
witnesses
on
his
behalf,
and
to
speak.
he
did
speak.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
record
does
not...
yes,
he
was.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
a
witness
present
at
that
hearing
and
he
had
the
opportunity
to
speak,
sir.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
january
2nd
is
a
hearing
conducted
by
the
program
review
committee.
at
that
hearing
he
had
the
same
opportunity
to
speak.
our
regulations
provide
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
call
a
witness,
to
have
a
witness
present,
to
have
that
witness
speak
on
his
behalf,
and
that
a
determination
is
made.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
a
written
summary
was
made
of
those
hearings.
a
verbatim
transcript
is
not
made.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
your
honor,
he
was
in
administrative
custody.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
from
december
3rd,
right
after
the
riot
in
the
prison,
until
january
22nd,
a
total
of
51
days.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
january
22nd
is
the
day
that
he
had
a
full-blown
wolff-type
hearing,
at
which
he
had
the
opportunity
to
speak,
call
witnesses,
and
be
heard.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
at
the
conclusion,
one
of
the
determinations,
of
course,
at
that
january
22nd
hearing
was
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
second
misconduct
charge.
at
that
time
it
was
determined
that
he
should
serve
six
months
in
disciplinary
custody.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
well,
in
pennsylvania
prisons,
your
honor,
the
physical
setup,
disciplinary
custody
is
much
the
same
as
administrative
custody
and
not
at
all
dissimilar
to
general
population,
either.
the
basic
difference,
of
course,
is
the
purpose.
disciplinary
is
punitive
and
administrative
is
that
tool
which
we
have
provided
in
pennsylvania
with
these
regulations.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
he
is.
there
is
a
basic
difference,
and
that
goes
to
what
the
effect
of
that
custody
is.
in
disciplinary
custody
there
is
no
question
that
it
affects
his
parole
and
it
would
affect
his
pre-release
status.
in
administrative
custody--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--your
honor,
we
don't
have
good
time
in
pennsylvania.
in
administrative
custody,
there
is
no
effect
on
parole
or
on
pre-release
status.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
january
22nd
hearing
dealt
with
the
two
misconducts,
in
essence.
however,
the
first
misconduct
that
he
was
charged
with
generally
on
december
4th
was
withdrawn
without
conclusion
at
the
january
22nd
hearing,
and
the
finding
of
that
hearing
committee
was
on
the
second
misconduct
charge,
where
he
was
confined
to
disciplinary
for
six
months
at
that
hearing.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes.
in
both
instances
he
was
accused
of
physically
assaulting
guards.
the
guards
suffered
serious
injuries,
and
he
was
one,
as
i
said,
of
18
inmates
that
were
segregated
on
the
night
of
december
3rd,
1978,
as
a
result
of
this
prison
riot.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
they
were
different
guards,
your
honor.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
first
date...
the
dates
are
the
same,
december
3rd,
1978.
in
the
first
misconduct
charge,
at
that
time
this
whole
riot
was
in
operation.
a
charge
was
prepared
and
given
to
him
the
next
day,
and
there
wasn't
the
specificity
of
the
particular
guard
at
that
time.
this
investigation
was
continuing
and
was
under
way.
the
second
misconduct
charge
was
specific.
they
assaulted
sergeant
phillips,
a
corrections
officer.
and
that's
the
one
he
was
ultimately
determined
to
be
guilty
of
and
confined
on.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
same
incident,
different
individuals,
and
more
specificity
in
the
second
misconduct.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
there's
a
reference
to
a
different
corrections
officer.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
104(b)...
to
answer
that
question,
justice
o'connor,
there
have
been...
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
pennsylvania
cases
interpreting
that
section.
prison
authorities
must
have
this
latitude
because
the
court
has
said
prison
society
is
different
from
our
society
at
large,
and
it's
essential
that
our
administrators
provide
the
safety
and
the
security
of
the
inmates,
the
staff
and
the
communities
at
large,
where
there
is
always
concern
where
prisons
are
located.
the
prisons
are
different
in
many
ways.
they
are
places
where
there
are
large
numbers
of
violent
people
congregated.
there's
a
great
deal
of
resentment
and
hostility
in
our
prisons.
prisoners
far
outnumber
corrections
officials.
and
the
signs
of
potential
violence
are
subjective.
administrators
recognize
those
signs
by
virtue
of
the
amalgam
of
their
experience,
their
intuitive
powers,
and
perhaps
their
sixth
sense
as
well.
for
those
policy
reasons,
it
is
essential
that
the
court
continue
to
permit
prison
administrators
to
possess
the
latitude
to
exercise
discretion
unless,
unless
the
state
through
its
regulations
or
statutes
binds
itself
to
limit
that
discretion.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
second
charge,
justice
stevens,
was
filed
on
january
19.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
misconduct
date
was
not
the
19th.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
that
must
be
an
error.
the
incident
occurred
on
december
3rd.
all
of
the
assaults
occurred
on
that
night.
however,
he
was
not
charged...
i
think
it's
the
wording
there.
he
was
not
charged
until
january
with
the
second
misconduct,
the
specific
one
against
sergeant
phillips.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
the
misconduct
in
the
joint
appendix
at
37a,
misconduct
90908,
he
was
give
that
charge
on
december
4th,
and
the
alleged
misconduct--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--the
3rd
was
the
date
of
the
incident,
the
riot,
the
day
before.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
page
30a
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
misconduct
date
is
stated,
december
3rd,
1978,
90986.
and
at
30a
in
the
second
paragraph,
justice
stevens.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
subsequent
to
the
january
22nd
hearing--
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
--those
were
dismissed
against
him,
yes,
sir.
the
regulations
here
do
not
bind
pennsylvania
prison
officials
do
no
bind
pennsylvania
prison
officials
to
do
or
to
refrain
from
doing
what
can
be
determined
by
objective
standards.
section
95.107(a)(1),
which
is
at
page
46
of
our
brief,
that
is
the
general
policy
statement
of
when
to
use
administrative
segregation
and
the
purposes
i
mentioned
a
few
moments
ago...
protection
of
the
prison
society
by
segregating
inmates
who
pose
a
threat,
who
may
be
an
escape
risk.
all
these
factors
are
subjective
and
require
predictive
judgments
on
the
part
of
our
prison
officials.
also
at
issue,
of
course,
is
95.104,
which
i've
argued...
is
at
page
43
of
our
brief...
which
i
said
is
a
similar
policy
statement
for
using
administrative
custody.
because
these
factors
are
subjective
in
nature,
there
is
no
liberty
interest
created.
if
this
court
finds
no
liberty
interest,
then
it
need
go
no
further.
if
the
court
finds
a
liberty
interest,
i
urge
the
court
to
reject
the
third
circuit
court's
conclusion
that
the
full
range
of
procedures
prescribed
in
wolff
must
be
provided.
many
of
the
same
considerations
which
we
contend
militate
against
a
finding
of
a
liberty
interest
are
also
relevant
to
the
issue
of
what
process
is
due.
specifically,
the
factors
considered
are
subjective
and
they
are
predictive
as
well.
the
government
has
an
overriding
concern
for
the
security
in
the
institutions.
the
consequences
of
administrative
custody
are
minimal.
thus,
all
of
these
reasons
dictate
against
requiring
the
full
range
of
trial-like
procedures
required
by
the
court
below.
in
this
case,
the
prisoner
got
as
much
as
the
constitution
requires,
if
indeed
the
constitution
requires
anything.
thank
you.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
briefly.
my
opponent
referred
to
the
hoss
case
and
to
the
i.c.u.
consent
decree.
the
hoss
case
is
a
district
court
in
1978
that
dealt
with
a
single
prisoner
in
confinement
for
five
years.
and
we
feel
that
that
decision
relating
to
one
prisoner
has
no
precedential
impact
or
binding
effect,
and
we
urge
this
court
to
reject
that
reasoning
in
the
hoss
case.
and
in
connection
with
the
reference
to
the
i.c.u.
consent
decree,
the
consent
decree
was
in
the
nature
of
a
class
action,
styled
as
a
class
action
and
a
general
challenge
to
prison
conditions,
and
it
was
settled
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
in
a
consent
decree.
now,
it's
our
position
that
the
genesis
of
the
regulation
is
not
relevant.
it's
the
clear
and
precise
language
of
the
regulation
in
pennsylvania
examined
that
does
not
create
the
mutual
expectation
that
is
necessary
for
a
liberty
interest.
the
regulation
in
place,
in
question
here,
was
in
effect
before
the
decision
in
that
consent
decree.
one
point
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to.
i
said
our
regulations
in
pennsylvania
require...
provide
for
a
person
to
have
a
hearing
and
to
call
a
witness.
and
in
answer
to
a
question,
justice
marshall,
i
answered
your
question
that
our
regulations
provide
for
that
and
that
i
made,
as
attorney
general
i
made,
an
inquiry
into
our
staff
to
determine
whether
in
fact
a
witness
was
present.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
i
believe
i
answered
the
question
that
way.
i
want
to
make
sure
i
did
at
this
time.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
that
he
was
there.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
i
made
an
inquiry,
justice
marshall,
to
determine
that
a
witness
was
there
at
that
hearing,
sir.
i
wanted
to
clarify
my
position.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
there
was
also
a
witness
on
behalf
of
the
inmate
at
that
hearing.
that
was
the
question
i
believe
that
was
asked.
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
there
is
a
record.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
yes,
sir.
it
does
not
mention
that
there
was
a
witness
there
on
behalf
of
the
inmate.
mr.
leroy
s.
zimmerman
at
page
39a
of
the
joint
appendix
and
40a,
the
reference
to
the
action
on
that
date,
the
misconduct
and
the
hearing
committee's
action,
you'll
see
the
block
there,
the
inmate
entered
a
plea
