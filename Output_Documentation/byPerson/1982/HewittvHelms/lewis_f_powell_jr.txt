--deferment

mr.
fishman,
i'm
not
entirely
clear
as
to
the
full
scope
of
your
claim.
i
do
understand
that
you
are
arguing
that
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
to
have
held
your
client
from
december
3rd
until
january
22nd
without
a
full
due
process
hearing,
a
wolff-type
hearing.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
22nd
that
resulted
in
the
six
months
of
confinement.
you're
not
objecting
to
that
hearing,
are
you,
in
terms
of
its
adequacy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
your
complaint
doesn't
include
that,
as
i
read
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
is
the
adequacy
of
the
due
process
at
the
january
22nd
hearing
before
this
court
in
this
case?
