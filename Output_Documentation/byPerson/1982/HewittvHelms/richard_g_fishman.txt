mr.
richard
g.
fishman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
wolff
versus
mcdonnell
revisited
with
a
slightly
different
twist.
whether
the
segregated
confinement
in
this
case
is
legally
or
technically
administrative
custody,
these
prison
officials
considered
it
disciplinary
in
its
nature
from
its
inception,
based
on
a
single
triggering
event,
the
disturbance,
and
not
based
on
the
respondent's
general
background
or
record.
and
i
think
some
of
the
facts
need
to
be
clarified
for
purpose
of
showing
my
point.
on
december
3rd,
that
same
evening,
the
respondent,
mr.
helms,
was
taken
from
his
cell
in
the
general
prison
population
and
placed
in
a
disciplinary
cell
in
segregation
under
investigation
for
suspected
involvement
in
the
disturbance
that
evening.
he
was
charged
with
a
misconduct
or
disciplinary
rule
violation
within
24
hours
of
his
confinement
on
the
3rd.
now,
the
december
8th,
1978,
hearing
committee
report,
that's
the
disciplinary
tribunal.
it's
in
dispute
in
this
case.
it's
our
position
no
hearing
was
taken
on
that
particular
date,
that
his
case
was
merely
continued
due
to
insufficient
information
and
pending
the
results
of
a
state
police
investigation.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
for,
on
that
issue.
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
in
response
to
paragraph
19
of
the
complaint,
stated
that
the
first
hearing
on
the
misconduct,
the
first
adjudication
or
factfinding,
did
not
take
place
until
january
22nd
of
1979,
or
51
days
later.
now,
it's
important
to
note
that
on
that
report
of
the
hearing
committee
on
december
8th
it
was
labeled
at
the
top
"misconduct
report".
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
they
remanded
it
for
a
determination
factually
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
a
hearing
in
respect
to
the
procedures
that
mr.
helms
asked
for.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes,
there
was
some...
it
had
been
decided
on
summary
judgment
initially
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
felt
that
there
were
some
contradictory
statements,
the
answer
to
the
complaint
that
i
just
mentioned,
the
paragraph
19
stating
that
the
first
adjudication
was
on
the
22nd
of
january,
and
then
the
statement
that
mr.
helms
signed
on
the
8th
which
indicated
the
opposite,
that
he
had
a
hearing
on
that
day.
that's
what
the
remand
was,
to
clarify
that
discrepancy.
moving
on,
the
status
review
of
january
2nd,
1979,
by
the
program
review
committee,
which
you've
heard
mentioned,
said
"continue
helms
in
disciplinary
custody",
even
though
he
hadn't
been
convicted
of
anything
as
of
that
date.
and
even
the
petitioners
at
page
14--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--of
a
misconduct
or
a
disciplinary
rule
violation.
he
hadn't
been
found
guilty
or
responsible.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
no,
but
i'm
trying
to
show--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--a
finding.
at
this
point
there
had
been
no
finding
one
way
or
the
other,
but
it
said
"continue
in
disciplinary
custody".
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
the
prison
officials
considered
this
disciplinary
from
its
inception,
regardless
of
whether
technically
or
legally
it
was
administrative
custody.
and
as
i
said
in
the
brief
at
page
14,
they
stated
he
was
confined
in
segregation
because
he
was
charged
with
a
major
misconduct.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
conditions
of
administrative
custody
were
the
equivalent
of
punitive
or
disciplinary
segregation.
and
the
conditions
that
mr.
helms
experienced
until
he
had
this
hearing
on
the
22nd
of
january
involved
sensory
deprivation
in
its
true
sense.
he
was
confined
in
a
cell
almost
24
hours
a
day.
the
only
time
he
got
out
was
between
five
and
ten
minutes
a
day
for
exercise,
three
or
four
days
a
week.
if
he
attempted
to
as
much
as
talk
in
a
normal
tone,
he
was
threatened
with
an
institutional
misconduct.
in
december
and
january,
showers
were
virtually
nonexistent.
studies
have
indicated,
as
i
tried
to
show
in
my
brief,
that
this
kind
of
confinement
can
and
often
does
lead
to
adverse
mental
effects
upon
the
inmate.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes,
but
i
think
in
this
case
it's
a
question
of
degree,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
confinement
involved
here
that
i've
described
is
what
naturally
inures
as
part
of
a
pennsylvania
sentence.
and
i
believe
that
the
potential
of
this
kind
of
confinement
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
pennsylvania
evolved
from
the
1700's
and
1800's
in
quaker
thought
of
segregated
or
solitary
confinement
to
the
congregate
or
general
population
idea
that
we
have
today.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
no.
we
believe
that
the
collateral
consequences
are
the
same.
under
pennsylvania
law--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--yes.
even
the
petitioners
in
their
briefs
said
or
conceded
that
it
may
result
in
a
delay
in
a
parole
hearing
or
delay
of
release
on
parole.
pennsylvania
law
and
policy,
justice
o'connor,
requires
that
his
status
be
reported
to
the
parole
board,
the
conduct
involved.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
i
would
say
yes.
they're
worse,
because
it's
indefinite
in
length.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
well,
yes.
here
that's
what
happened.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
virtually
none,
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
i'd
like
to--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--no.
but
in
this
case
i
do.
first
of
all,
there's
been
discussion
about
the
regulation
95.104(b)(3).
i
believe
justice
o'connor
brought
that
up
earlier.
that
regulation
provides
in
all
cases
the
inmate
must
be
released
within
ten
days.
in
addition--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--no,
i
believe
the
"but
in
all
cases"
is
afterwards,
so
that
it
would
not
be
conditioned
on
a
behavior--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
well,
there
is
a
pennsylvania
case,
hoss
versus
cuyler,
which
i
cited
in
my
brief,
which
interprets
the
same
regulation
as
stating
that
it
creates
a
liberty
interest
in
the
freedom
from
the,
and
the
words
are,
"harsh
conditions
of
administrative
custody"
in
pennsylvania.
and
one
of
the
points
i'd
like
to
make
is,
regardless
of
how
one
looks
at
the
wording
itself
of
these
regulations,
these
regulations
came
out
of
a
federal
court
consent
decree
called
i.c.u.
versus
shapp.
the
state
voluntarily
entered
a
consent
decree.
the
regulations
were
issued
as
a
result
of
it.
so
if
the
standard
for
creating
a
liberty
interest
is
the
mutual
expectation,
it's
definitely
present
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
that
was
a
general
conditions
suit.
there
were
many
issues
in
that
case,
from
disciplinary
confinement
to
access
to
law
libraries
and
so
forth.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes,
he
was,
because
the
court
of
appeals
decision
throwing
out
the
misconduct
conviction
did
not
take
place
until
much
afterwards.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
well,
the
record
is
unclear
on
that.
he
did
serve
more
than
his
minimum
release
date,
but--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--eventually,
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
1980.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
direct
connection.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
no.
i
believe
the
record
is
unclear
on
that,
that
particular
point.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
well,
the
pennsylvania
statutes,
as
well
as
the
policies
of
the
board
of
probation
and
parole
in
pennsylvania,
require
that
the
conduct
of
the
individual
be
reported
by
prison
officials
as
well
as
investigated
by
the
parole
board.
in
addition,
program
involvement
or
lack
of
it,
in
terms
of
rehabilitative
program,
is
also
reported
to
the
parole
board.
here
in
this
confinement...
i
don't
think
i
mentioned
this...
he
lost
his
institutional
job.
he
was
denied
any
access
to
the
program.
so
what
i'm
saying
is,
that
starts
with
a
negative--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--yes,
yes,
an
indirect
effect.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
also
found
in
this
case
that
the
institution
returned
to
normal
within
a
day
of
the
disturbance
of
december
3rd.
and
i've
already
mentioned
about
the
104(b)(3),
that
regulation
holding
someone
in
investigative
status.
there
was
another
regulation,
administrative
directive
004,
which
required
the
results
of
the
state
police
investigation
to
be
communicated
to
the
superintendent
of
the
institution
prior
to
the
criminal
charges
being
filed.
here
they
were
filed
on
december
11th
and,
as
we
heard
earlier,
they
were
dismissed.
yet
still
helms
did
not
have
his
hearing
until
the
22nd
of
january.
in
addition,
lieutenant
kyler,
who
was
the
charging
officer
and
who
had
submitted
two
affidavits
in
this
case,
the
second
one
appearing
at
page
82
of
the
joint
appendix,
indicated
that
he
was
informed
to
go
ahead
regardless
of
the
status
of
the
criminal
case,
to
go
ahead
with
the
institutional
disciplinary
charges.
so
my
point
being
that
the
delay
here
i
do
not
think
was
justified.
also,
in
terms
of
the
question
of
burden,
the
second
set
of
admissions
in
this
case
indicates
that
between
december
3rd
of
1978
and
january
21st
of
'79
215
wolff-type
hearings
were
conducted
in
the
institution,
19
of
which
went
to
individuals
allegedly
involved
in
the
disturbance.
there's
been
no
factual
evidence
presented
or
even
suggested
that
that
in
any
way
impeded
the
operation
of
the
institution
or
prevented
them
from
returning
to
normal.
in
addition,
there
was
no
evidence
presented
or
suggested
that
the
process
that
mr.
helms
claimed
was
due
and
which
prison
officials
claimed
that
they
provided
on
december
8th
would
in
any
way
impede
the
operation
of
the
facility.
now,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
concerning
prison
officials
in
a
riot
or
on
the
even
of
an
emergency
should
not
be
saddled
with
disciplinary
procedures
or
procedural
due
process.
what
i
think
has
become
lost
in
that
argument
is
that
we're
not
asking
for
procedures
in
that
context.
i
think
the
law
is
clear
from
this
court
and
through
the
third
circuit
as
well
that
in
an
emergency
those
procedures
can
be
done
away
with.
it's
afterwards
that
we're
asking
for
procedures.
now,
in
terms
of
liberty
interest,
here
we're
talking
about
the
basic
freedom
to
move
about.
we're
not
talking
about
an
individual
who's
seeking
some
minimum
security
status,
parole
or
some
kind
of
privilege.
mr.
helms
sought
what
he
had
prior
to
december
3rd,
1978,
the
freedom
to
move
about
in
the
general
prison
population
where
he
was
located
on
that
date.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
i
do
not
believe
the
restrictions
involved
in
here
can
in
any
way
be
considered
what
naturally
inures
in
a
pennsylvania
sentence.
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
decision
making
process--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
there's
a
damage
issue
pending
in
the
case.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
no.
he
was...
the
criminal
charges
were
dismissed.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
no,
no
civil
actions.
and
i
would
believe
also
the
evidence
in
this
case
indicates
no
legally
sufficient
evidence
that
he
was
even
involved
in
the
disturbance,
and
that
would
be
our
position.
in
terms
of
the
decision
making,
there's
almost
always
going
to
be
a
triggering
event
or
series
of
triggering
events,
as
you
had
in
this
case.
and
i
believe
that
the
decision
making
is
objective.
in
my
brief
i
attempted
to
explain
how
the
bureau
of
prisons,
in
dealing
with
incoming
inmates
in
making
custody
or
security
decisions,
looks
at--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
well,
there
would
be
two...
there
would
be
a
possibility
that...
there
was
a
remand
on
the
issue
of
good
faith.
if
the
lower
court
would
find
that
good
faith...
that
the
legal
issue
on
informants
was
not
clearly
established
at
this
time,
then
we
would
receive
no
money
damages
assuming
we
established
liability.
that
would
then
take
us
to
the
administrative
custody
situation,
and
the
lower
court
would
have
to
make
a
decision,
assuming
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
8th,
it's
remanded
and
there
was
no
hearing,
there
would
then
have
to
be
a
good
faith
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
issue
of
right
to
procedural
due
process
in
the
administrative
custody
context
was
established.
so
that
we
could
theoretically
get
damages
for
the
period
of
time
he
was
in
administrative
segregation--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--even
if
we
didn't
prevail
for
the
whole
six
months
of
the
disciplinary.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
correct,
51
days.
now,
in
terms
of
objective
decision
making,
i've
mentioned
how
the
bureau
of
prisons
looks
at
the
factors,
assigns
points
to
them,
and
then
tries
to
turn
the
professional
impressions
into
objective
decision
making.
in
the
disciplinary
context,
you
take
the
facts,
you
apply
them
to
the
elements
of
the
charge,
and
you
come
out
with
a
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence.
in
the
administrative
context,
you
also
apply
the
facts
to
the
elements.
they
may
be
different,
but
you
come
out
with
a
decision
of
a
security
risk
or
a
safety
concern.
that
is
in
the
situation
where
you
don't
have
a
triggering
event
as
here,
and
i
believe
the
thought
processes
are
the
same.
even
if
you
take
the
position,
well,
whatever
facts
are
involved
still
have
to
be
filtered
through
the
subjective
analysis
of
the
decision
maker,
the
nuances
or
subtleties
that
might
be
involved
here
are
certainly
no
greater
than
what
was
involved
in
the
psychiatric
diagnosis
in
vitek
versus
jones.
and
there
this
court
found
procedural
due
process
was
required,
even
though
the
decision
makers
were
some
of
society's
most
highly
trained
professionals.
and
some
of
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
indicated
that
where
there
has
been
rampant
violence
in
an
institution
or
situations
of
individual
rapes
that
the
custody
decisions
are
being
made
on
the
basis
of
gut
feelings
or
insufficient
data,
and
that's
what
i
think
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
here.
procedural
due
process
will
guard
or
help
guard
against
the
possibility
of
disciplinary
custody
being
labeled
administrative,
but
without
the
procedural
protections...
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
we've
asked
for,
in
addition
to
a
wolff-type
hearing,
we've
asked
for
written
notice
and
a
written
statement
of
the
evidence
relied
upon
and
reasons
for
the
action
taken.
that
has
import
for
the
inmate
in
terms
of
helping
him
prepare
or
present
a
case,
but
also
for
correctional
administrators.
it
makes
for
a
record
to
help
base
subsequent
decisions
on.
in
addition,
if
the
prison
official
was
not
present
at
the
initial
decision
it
becomes
crucial
to
understand
what
has
happened
in
the
case.
now,
in
my
brief
i
also
ask
for
the
discretionary
ability,
the
discretion
being
with
the
chairman
of
the
hearing,
to
allow
questioning
by
the
inmate
and
compelling
the
attendance
of
witnesses.
pennsylvania
allows
for
that
presently
in
its
disciplinary
system,
and
i
cited
in
my
brief
a
survey
that
shows
that
most
jurisdictions
or
the
majority
of
jurisdictions
have
some
type
of
framework
set
up
in
the
administrative
custody--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--he
did
what?
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
no,
i
do
not
believe
he
did
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
i
think
what
he
was
referring
to,
i
think,
was
the
correctional
officer
who
testified
against
him.
but
i'm
not
aware
that
there
was
a
witness
presented
in
his
case.
i
believe
that
the
burden
involved,
since
most
of
the
jurisdictions
have
some
type
of
framework
set
up,
is
minimal.
i
also,
in
looking
at
the
federal
system
in
the
bureau
of
prisons,
in
what
is
known
as
control
unit
cases,
where
an
individual
is
considered
a
threat
or
is
unable
to
function
in
a
less
secure
environment,
an
escape
risk
or
he
presents
some
type
of
danger,
that
individual
presently
gets
what
is
in
essence
a
wolff
type
hearing.
in
weighing
the
factors
and
in
helping
to
reduce
the
risk
of
error
and
guard
against
abuse,
i
think
these
procedures
are
absolutely
necessary,
and
we
would
request
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
it
stated--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--yes.
it's
page
39
and
40
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
that's
in
the
record
also.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
well,
i
think
one
thing.
my
facts
are
a
little
bit
different,
because
i
say
that
it's
disciplinary
custody
also
because
of
the
conditions.
i
think
the
conditions
are
worse
than
in
the
federal
situation.
but
also
because
of
what
the
prison
officials
thought
it
was.
i
think
they
thought
it
was
disciplinary
in
nature
from
the
beginning.
that
was
the
beginning
of
my
argument.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
i
would
say
that
the
custody
here
is
so
severe
that
it
cannot
in
any
way
be
considered
part
of
the
normal
pennsylvania
sentence
that
one
expects.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
i
don't
think
this
court
has
to
reach
that
issue.
but
when
you
look
at
the
question
of
sanitation
and
virtually
no
showers
for
two
months
and
virtually
no
exercise
and
not
being
able
to
speak
in
a
normal
tone,
you
might
decide
that
way.
but
i
don't
think
that
has
to
be
decided
in
my
case.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
not
in
a
general
sense.
in
this
specific
case--
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
--well,
it
did,
because
we
challenged
the
basis
of
the
conviction
on
the
informant's
testimony,
and
the
court
of
appeals...
that
issue
isn't
before
this
court,
but
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
my
position
that
the
january
22nd
hearing
was
defective.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
no.
mr.
richard
g.
fishman
correct.
