justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
fishman,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold
with
respect
to
whether
that
first
hearing
on
december
8th
had
or
had
not
taken
place?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they
didn't...
they
made
some
comment
in
their
opinion,
didn't
they,
about
the
fact
that
your
client
had
signed
some
sort
of
a
statement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
second
of
the
two
cases,
hewitt
against
helms
comes
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
aaron
helms,
the
respondent,
was
serving
a
prison
term
in
a
pennsylvania
prison.
during
his
term,
he
was
involved
in
a
riot
which
several
prison
guards
were
injured.
as
a
result,
the
prison
officials
confined
helms
to
what
they
called
“administrative
segregation.”
this
meant
that
he
would
be
restricted
to
his
cell.
the
officials
ordered
this
confinement
because
they
believe
helms
pose
a
threat
to
the
security
and
safety
of
other
prisoners
and
guards
at
the
prison.
they
were
also
investigating
the
possibility
that
misconduct
charges
should
be
brought
against
him
because
of
his
role
in
the
prison
riot.
helms
later
sued
the
officials
in
the
federal
district
court,
claiming
united
states
constitution
required
the
prison
officials
to
hold
a
formal
trial-like
hearing
before
they
could
place
him
in
an
administrative
segregation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
agreed
with
helms
and
held
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
special
hearing
to
determine
whether
it
is
proper
to
place
him
in
administrative
segregation.
we
have
concluded
that
while
helms
was
guaranteed
some
protection
under
state
law
and
the
due
process
clause,
the
prison
officials
afford
him
all
of
the
constitution
required.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
and
in
part
by
justice
blackmun.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
a
part
–
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
