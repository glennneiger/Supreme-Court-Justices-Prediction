justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel,
i
think
you
mentioned
that
the
regional
director
filed
a
petition
with
the
federal
district
court
seeking
to
enjoin
the
entire
state
action.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
have
stated
the
result
of
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
district
court
file
an
opinion?
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
district
court
file
an
opinion?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
ms.
corwin?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
we
are
not
giving
you
much
of
an
opportunity
to
argue
your
case,
but
i
have
a
couple
of
questions.
do
you
agree
that
the
complaint
in
the
state
court
on
its
face
alleged
an
action
of
malicious
libel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
end
result
of
the
board's
decision
that
was
enforced
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
to
enjoin
the
prosecution
of
that
suit,
is
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
so
the
effect
of
all
of
it
is
that
the
libel
suit
cannot
go
forward
in
the
state
court,
so
that
the
labor
board
where
a
federal
court
enforces
its
order
may
enjoin
a
libel
suit
bona
fide
on
its
face?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
which
in
effect
decides
the
issue
of
malice
in
a
libel
suit,
doesn't
it?
in
effect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
could
both
of
these
cases
have
gone
forward
simultaneously
at
the
same
time,
the
state
suit
and
the
proceeding
before
the
administrative
law
judge?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
was
a
state
suit
prosecuted
while
the
labor
proceeding
was
going
on?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
and
some
depositions
were
taken.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
never
went
to
actual
trial,
did
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
it
had
gone
to
trial
and
a
verdict
and
judgment
entered
on
it
for
the
plaintiff
before
the
labor
board
acted.
would
it
have
been
obligated
to
respect
that,
or
what
would
have
happened
then?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
there
were
a
final
judgment
in
the
state
court,
do
you
think
the
board
would
defer
to
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
on
the
libel
issue.
that
is
all
that
is
involved
in
the
state
court.
