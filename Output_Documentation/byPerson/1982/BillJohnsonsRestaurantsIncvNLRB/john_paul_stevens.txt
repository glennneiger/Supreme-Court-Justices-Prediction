justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
ms.
corwin,
in
his
own
findings
he
did
conclude
that
the
respondent
did
not
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
filing
his
lawsuit.
in
two
or
three
places,
he
says
something
similar
to
that.
so
he
had
to
make
that
inquiry
before
he
made
that
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
a
little
hard
for
me
to
understand
a
lawsuit
that
has
no
reasonable
basis
succeeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
administrative
law
judge
looked
at
the
facts
and
said
those
attacks
were
true.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
you
can't
say
he
didn't
look
at
the
merits
of
the
case,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
go
farther
than
motive.
they
go...
i
mean,
maybe
he
is
right.
i
am
not
reaching
that
question.
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can
argue
that
he
didn't
look
at
the
merits
of
the
lawsuit,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
corwin,
would
you
agree
that
your
theory
as
you
have
given
it
to
us
in
response
to
justice
white's
questions
is
quite
different
from
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
did
rely
squarely
on
the
absence
of
any
reasonable
basis
in
fact,
and
on
that
finding?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
additional
evidence
of
improper
motive,
but
i
think
it
was
critical
to
their
holding
that
there
was
a
finding
that
has
not
been
challenged,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
cert
petition,
that
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
in
fact,
which
is
quite
different
from
your
theory.
your
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
there
is
improper
motive,
no
matter
how
good
the
lawsuit
is,
there
is
still
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i
don't
want...
you
don't
have
to
repeat
that,
but
all
i'm
suggesting,
that's
a
very
different
theory
than
the
court
of
appeals
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
i
wonder
if
the
suit
can
really
be
characterized
as
that
devastating
if
it
is
frivolous
on
its
face.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
once
they've
got
their
side
presented
to
the
state
court
judge,
he
found
no
significant
merit
to
the
complaint,
and
the
risks,
it
seems
to
me,
were
minimal
after
that
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
true,
they
had
damned
them,
and
the
complaint
is
for
a
lot
of
money,
but
you
know,
there
are
a
lot
of
complaints
like
that
that
don't
have
any
merit
to
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
for
it.
we
have
such
a
finding
that
everybody
agrees
is
true.
so,
i
mean,
what
is
the
jeopardy?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
we
have
to
assume
there
is
no
merit
to
the
suit,
i
believe,
in
analyzing
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
sure
are.
they
can't
go
forward
with
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
certainly
must
follow
that
the
case
is
over
in
the
state
court,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
misunderstood.
it
is
pending.
