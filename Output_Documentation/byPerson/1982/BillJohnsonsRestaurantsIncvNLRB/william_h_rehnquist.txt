justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
katz,
were
these--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--questions
of
federal
law,
state
law,
or
some
of
both?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
administrative
law
judge
examined
issues
that
were
concededly
of
state
law,
such
as
whether
there
was
a
publication
under
the
arizona
law
of
libel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
federal
question
could
be
pending
before
the
state
court.
i
was
more
interested
in
whether
the
administrative
law
judge
also
examined
question
that
were
concededly
only
of
state
law.
did
the
administrative
law
judge
say
there
wasn't
anything
to
the
suit
under
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
an
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
katz,
what
do
you
mean
by
the
board
going
forward?
do
you
mean
going
forward
with
any
of
the
possible
proceedings
against
the
employer,
or
do
you
mean
just
going
forward
in
making
a
determination
as
to
the
merits
of
the
employer's
state
court
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
katz,
do
you
know
what
the
first
case
decided
by
the
board
was
in
which
the
conducting
of
a
state
lawsuit
was
found
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know
that.
i
agree.
what
if
the
administrative
law
judge
made
the
finding
of
fact
that
the
employer
bore
extreme
animus
and
anti-union
sentiment
against
the
employees
in
filing
this
suit,
and
made
a
second
finding
of
fact
that
the
suit
was
not
pre-empted
under
any
federal
doctrine,
was
well
grounded
in
state
law,
and
would
in
all
probability
succeed,
and
that
goes
to
the
board?
would
they
say
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
corwin,
how
many
administrative
law
judges
are
there
for
the
national
labor
relations
board,
just
an
order
of
magnitude?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
each
of
them
grounded,
say,
in
the
libel
law
of
all
the
50
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
we
are
right
back
to
the
hypothetical
that
justice
white
put
to
you,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me...
i
realize
you
prefer
not
to
answer
the
question,
and
certainly
there
may
be
good
reasons
for
it,
but
if
you
are
now
going
to
again
stress
motive
rather
than
the
merit
of
the
suit,
it
seems
to
me
you
do
have
to
face
up
to
the
hypothetical.
what
if...
there
is
no
question
that
all
100
administrative
law
judges
would
have
found
anti-union
animus,
and
yet
any
objective
lawyer
viewing
the
merits
of
the
state
court
suit
would
have
said
it
is
grounded
in
fact
and
will
probably
succeed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
earlier
answer
to
me
was
that
the
100
administrative
law
judges
don't
have
to
be
grounded
in
state
law
because
all
they
look
at
is
animus.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
was
it
addressed
to
a
reasonable
basis
of
the
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
to
the
judge,
to
that...
to
the
extent
he
made
that
sort
of
a
finding,
would
have
to
know
something
about
the
law
of
the
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
broad
outlines
of
what?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
libel
law
is
uniform
throughout
the
50
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
do
you
know
when
malice
is
necessary,
without
turning
to
the
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
a
conclusion
of
bad
motive
is
enough
even
though
it
were
decided
that
the
lawsuit
had
merit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--when
was
the
first
time
after
1935
that
the
board
entered
an
order
such
as
this
requiring
the
cessation
of
a
state
court
lawsuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
more
interested
in
the
chronology
of
it.
so,
for
the
first
15
years
after
the
enactment
of
the
wagner
act,
there
were
no
such
orders
entered
by
the
board?
