mr.
katz,
would
you
concede
that
perhaps
the
national
labor
relations
board,
through
its
administrative
law
judge,
could
still
consider
issues
relating
to
whether
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
here
to
have
filed
the
state
suit
at
least
for
purposes
of
giving
other
remedial
relief
other
than
the
cease
and
desist
order,
for
example,
requiring
payment
of
costs
of
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
see
in
the
act
that
would
affect
the
timing
of
the
board's
jurisdiction
in
that
regard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
if
the
board
had
limited
its
relief
to
an
order
that
court
costs
or
legal
fees
be
paid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
katz,
in
this
instance,
unless
i
am
mistaken,
your
client
was
found
by
the
board
to
have
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
prosecuting
the
suit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
are
not
challenging
that?
that
is
not
an
issue
you
raised
in
your
cert
petition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
issue
really
wasn't
raised
in
your
petition,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
read
your
petition
as
challenging
the
power
of
the
board
to
order
you
to
cease
and
desist
from
the
state
court
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
action
of
the
board
was
initiated
before
the
state
court
suit,
on
allegations
of
unfair
labor
practice,
and
then
it
develops
that
the
suit
is
filed
and
they
expand
the
case?
you
say
they
have
to
stop?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
your
position
would
be
that
if
what
had
happened
here
was
that
bill
johnson's
had
threatened
a
lawsuit,
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
go
ahead
and
process
a
complaint.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
the
suit
is
filed
by
bill
johnson's,
then
it
must
stop
what
it
is
doing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
your
position
that
what
the
board
has
to
do
is
to
simply
find
whether
the
employer
had
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
the
alleged
facts
he
is
relying
on
occurred?
or
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
what's
the
board's
standard
in
these
cases?
that
is
what
i
think
we
are
concerned
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
determination
of
whether
the
lawsuit
has
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact
just
a
means
of
assessing
whether
it
was
filed
for
a
retaliatory
purpose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
is
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
we
do
if
we
read
it
that
way,
in
your
view?
then
what
action
should
this
court
take,
assuming
we
read
it
as
saying
there
has
to
be
a
finding
of
no
reasonable
basis
in
fact?
they
really
weren't
entitled
to
affirm
on
that
basis,
were
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
corwin,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
would
indicate
congress
thought
about
the
possibility
that
an
employer
or
union
prosecution
of
a
state
court
suit
could
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
my
question
was
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
legislative
history,
and
i
thought
perhaps
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
way
to
accommodate
the
parallel
interests
here
short
of
ordering
a
cease
and
desist
of
the
state
suit?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
middle
ground
or
other
means
of
accommodating
these
interests?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
payment
of
fees
and
expenses
and
letting
the
state
court
determine
the
merits
of
the
action
would
be
an
accommodation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
i
see.
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
the
state
court
deny
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
libel
aspects?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
isn't
that
waiting
to
go
to
trial?
