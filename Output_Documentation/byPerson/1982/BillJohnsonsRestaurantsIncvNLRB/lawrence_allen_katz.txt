mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
restraints
should
be
placed
upon
the
power
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
interfere
with
civil
proceedings
instituted
in
state
court
and
growing
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
the
civil
litigation
in
this
case
was
a
suit
filed
in
the
arizona
superior
court
by
petitioner,
bill
johnson's
restaurants,
against
several
persons
who
were
demonstrating
in
front
of
the
restaurant
in
september,
1978.
the
suit
alleged
that
the
protesters
had
defamed
the
restaurant
by
publishing
leaflets
which
accused
the
restaurant
in
engaging
in
a
refusal
to
pay
lawful
overtime,
in
sexually
harassing
waitresses,
in
discharging
a
waitress
for
union
activity,
and
maintaining
filthy
restrooms.
the
suit
also
asked
for
injunctive
relief
and
for
damages
for
misconduct
occurring
during
the
demonstrations.
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
some
controversies
arising
out
of
labor
disputes
are
so
deeply
rooted
in
matters
of
local
concern
and
responsibility
that
the
state
courts
have
primary
jurisdiction
to
hear
and
determine
these
controversies
even
though
they
may
touch
on
matters
of
federal
concern
as
well,
and
i
refer
here
to
suits
growing
out
of
labor
controversies
involving
defamation,
involving
violence,
involving
trespass
and
other
torts
out
of
such
labor
disputes
where
the
public
peace
and
order
are
threatened.
in
these
cases,
the
state
has
been
held
to
have
an
overriding
interest
in
the
resolution
of
the
controversy.
despite
this
history,
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
in
the
present
case
ordered
the
restaurant
to
withdraw
its
civil
suit
and
to
compensate
the
defendants
for
all
expenses
incurred
by
them
in
the
defense
of
the
suit,
including
expenses
incurred
by
them
in
the
prosecution
of
their
counterclaims.
the
board
does
not
justify
its
order
in
this
case
by
any
finding
that
the
complaint
filed
by
the
restaurant
on
its
face
asked
for
relief
barred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
board
does
not
justify
its
order
in
this
case
by
any
finding
that
the
complaint
filed
by
the
restaurant
was
pre-empted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
or
that
it
raised
issues
that
were
already
pending
before
the
board.
instead,
the
board
attempts
to
justify
its
intrusion
into
the
parties'
civil
litigation
by
a
finding
that
the
restaurant's
suit
constituted
an
effort
to
retaliate
against
those
demonstrators
who
were
outside
its
premises.
to
reach
that
result,
the
board
performed
adjudicatory
responsibilities
that
should
have
been
performed
by
the
state
court.
after
the
restaurant
filed
its
suit,
the
board
compelled
the
restaurant
to
demonstrate
that
the
suit
had
some
reasonable
factual
basis,
that
it
had
merit.
considerable
evidence
was
presented
before
the
board's
administrative
law
judge
on
the
same
questions
that
were
then
pending
in
front
of
the
state
trial
court.
for
example,
were
the
offensive
statements
of
the
demonstrators
true
or
false?
did
the
demonstrators
publish
those
statements
knowing
them
to
be
true
or
false?
did
the
demonstrators
improperly
obstruct
or
interfere
with
the
restaurant's
operations?
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
questions
of
defamation
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute
are
questions
of
state
law.
the
questions
should
have
been
heard
and
determined
by
the
state
court.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
publication
was
not
at
issue,
but
other
questions
decided
by
the
administrative
law
judge,
justice
rehnquist,
were
in
fact
then
pending
before
the
state
court.
for
example,
were
the--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--yes,
he
did.
your
honor,
the--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--it
is
purely
a
state
law
question.
the
administrative
law
judge
determined...
the
administrative
law
judge
determined
that
in
fact
the
statements
on
the
relief
work
were
truthful,
and
in
fact
the
demonstrators
had
not
engaged
in
obstructions
or
interference
with
restaurant
property,
and
that
in
fact
the
restaurant's
lawsuit
lacked
a
reasonable
basis,
and
his
interpretation
had
to
be
one
of
state
law,
because
the
issue
was
one
of
state
law.
the
board--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--justice
o'connor,
i
would
say
that
the
responsibility
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
that
circumstance
would
be
to
wait
until
the
state
court
had
issued
its
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
lawsuit.
at
that
point,
if
the
state
court
had
failed
to
issue
sufficient
relief
to
protect
the
federal
rights
that
were
then
at
issue,
or
to
protect
the
rights
of
employees
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
board
certainly
had
the
opportunity
to
take
another
look
at
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
that
was
in
front
of
it
and
to
determine
whether
the
interests
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
required
supplemental
relief
to
be
ordered.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
section
10(j)
of
the
act
would
allow
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
file
a
petition
with
the
united
states
district
court
in
order
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
act
and
the
interests
of
employees
against
any
direct
infringement
that
might
occur
during
the
prosecution
of
that
suit.
for
example,
if
the
plaintiff
in
such
a
state
suit
engaged
in
discovery
which
the
board
determined
might
have
an
adverse
impact
on
a
proceeding
then
pending
before
the
board,
it
is
arguable
that
the
board
could
apply
under
section
10(j)
to
the
united
states
district
court
and
obtain
an
appropriately
limited
injunction.
in
this
case,
the
board
might
well
have
been
able
to
do
that,
but
instead--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--yes,
your
honor.
that
would
be
an
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act,
and
this
court
has
recognized
two
or
three
exceptions
to
the
anti-injunction
act
in
the
past,
and
i
think
one
of
them
would
be
applicable
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
when
the
board
has
to
act
in
aid
of
its
own
jurisdiction.
if
there
is
an
issue
pending
before
the
board
which
has
also
been
raised
before
the
state
court,
or
if
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court
threaten
to
impact
directly
on
the
proceedings
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
that,
i
believe,
is
what
congress
intended
section
10(j)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
be
used
for,
and
the
board
could
go
into
the
district
court
and
petition
for
appropriate
limited
injunctive
relief.
in
this
case,
the
board
did
not
seek
an
appropriate
limited
injunction
from
the
district
court.
the
board
petitioned
the
district
court
under
section
10(j)
for
an
injunction
restraining
the
entire
lawsuit
that
had
been
filed
in
the
state
court.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
while
the
state
court
suit
was
still
pending?
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
i
think
that
would
be
an
unwarranted
infringement
on
the
state
suit.
i
think
any
remedy
that
would
come
out
of
the
state
proceeding
was
within
the
original
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court,
and
the
board
could
only
interfere
with
that
proceeding
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
direct
impact
on
a
matter
pending
then
before
the
board.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
finding.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
it
has
not.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
i
think
that
if
the
civil
suit
on
its
face
were
to
allege
a
cause
of
action
barred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
then
the
administrative
law
judge
arguably
would
have
authority
to
take
action
and
perhaps
that
might
include
even
the
restraint
of
that
suit.
i
think,
for
example,
of
the
1970
machinists
case
and
the
1972
textile
workers
case,
in
which
unions
had
allegedly
violated
the
act
by
seeking
to
impose
fines
on
employees
who
had
engaged
in
conduct
that
was
against
the
union
constitution,
but
the
conduct
had
been
engaged
in
after
the
employees
had
resigned
from
the
union.
such
a
complaint
may
well
state
a
cause
of
action
barred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
in
those
cases
the
board
held
an
unfair
labor
practice
had
occurred,
and
the
board
enjoined
the
state
court
action
to
enforce
the
fines.
that,
of
course,
is
not
our
case,
because
the
state
court
complaint
filed
in
this
case
did
not
allege
a
cause
of
action
barred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
pre-empted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
result
of
it
was
that
the
federal
district
court
refused
to
issue
the
order
requested
by
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
yes,
included
in
our
opening
brief
as
appendix
c
are
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
of
the
district
court.
i
might
point
out,
if
your
honor
will
refer
to
exhibit
b
attached
to
our
brief,
which
is
a
selection
from
the
transcript
of
proceedings
before
the
district
court,
district
judge
crane
did
suggest
to
the
board
that
he
would
be
willing
to
consider
an
order
enjoining
the
respondent
from
interfering
with
proceedings
before
the
board,
but
the
board
did
not
pick
up
on
that
suggestion,
and
did
not
ask
for
any
more
limited
injunction.
instead,
it
asked
only
for
the
complete
restraining
order
against
the--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--the
district
court's
order
was
entered.
an
appeal
was
filed
but
was--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--he
did
file
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--he
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
produced
by
the
board
to
indicate
that
the
state
court
suit
lacked
a
reasonable
basis.
he
found
no
basis
for
determining
that
in
fact
an
unfair
labor
practice
had
occurred
in
the
filing
of
the
state
suit.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
there
was
an
appeal
initially
taken.
that
is
not
part
of
the
record
before
the
court.
it
was
later
withdrawn.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
it
is
difficult
to
read
the
national
labor
relations
board,
because--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i
read
the
board's
papers
filed
in
this
court
as
taking
the
position
that
if
the
suit
is
motivated
by
the
desire
to
retaliate,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
well,
although
the
board
is
willing
to
look
at
the
merits
of
the
state
court
suit
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
has
a
foundation
in
fact--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i
think
that's
a
fair
conclusion
from
the
position
the
board
has
taken.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
even
in
the
absence
of
an
unlawful
motivation,
a
suit
which
had
a
coercive
impact
on
employees
might
well
be
a
violation
of
section
81.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
that's
not...
well,
yes,
i
think
i'd
have
to
concede
that.
the
court
of
appeals
would
require
the
suit
have
no
basis.
it
is
not
clear
the
board
would
do
that.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
restaurants
also
had
a
lawful
objective
on
its
face,
and
then
the
ninth
circuit
went
on
to
say
that
the
proper
test
of
the
legitimacy
of
a
state
cause
of
action
is
whether
the
plaintiff
has
evidence
to
support
his
allegations.
now,
we
agree
with
that
holding,
but
we
disagree
with
the
ninth
circuit
as
to
the
appropriate
forum
in
which
such
evidence
should
be
tested.
simply
put,
our
position
is
that
the
nlrb
is
not
entitled
to
adjudicate
or
to
restrain
a
pending
state
court
lawsuit
which
has
a
lawful
objective
on
its
face
and
its
properly
subject
to
state
court
jurisdiction.
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
that
there
might
be
some
situations
in
which
the
state
court
suit
asks
for
relief
barred
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
such
a
case,
the
board
might
arguably
have
the
right
to
restraint
that
suit,
but
in
so
considering,
the
board
might
take
into
account
the
motive
for
filing
the
suit.
for
example,
there
have
been
a
number
of
suits
where
employers
have
sought
injunctions
against
activity
that
was
clearly
protected,
such
as
picketing.
in
such
cases,
it
has
been
the
board's
habit
to
evaluate
the
motive
for
such
suit,
and
if
the
board
determines
that
the
motive
is
one
of
good
faith,
the
board
has
typically
not
restrained
the
state
court
suit.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
well,
we
are
certainly
challenging
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
has
occurred
in
the
filing
of
the
suit,
and
more
importantly,
we
are
challenging
the
process
by
which
the
board
reached
its
conclusion
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
had
existed.
the
board--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--the
only
issue
that
i
think
you
may
be
referring
to
that
is
missing
from
the
petition
is
a
challenge
to
the
specific
findings
that
the
leaflet
was
truthful
and
did
not
constitute
defamation.
we
did
not
challenge
the--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--and
the
ability
of
the
board
to
find
that
a
suit
filed
in
state
court
which
has
a
lawful
purpose
on
its
face
and
is
subject
to
state
court
jurisdiction
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board
now
asserts
the
right,
and
it
is
a
very
broad
right,
to
conduct
a
threshold
scrutiny
of
litigation
involving
labor
disputes
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
plaintiff's
motivation
is
to
use
an
apparently
lawful
suit
in
order
to
retaliate
against
the
defendant
for
conduct
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
believe
the
board
has
no
such
power.
when
a
civil
suit
has
a
lawful
objective
on
its
face,
and
is
subject
to
state
court
jurisdiction,
the
state
court
interest
is
superior.
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
balancing
of
interests,
when
we
are
involved
with
a
labor
dispute,
when
there
are
some
federal
rights
at
issue,
and
when
there
are
some
state
rights
to
be
protected,
but
when
the
suit
has
a
lawful
objective,
it
is
properly
subject
to
state
court
jurisdiction,
that
balancing
test
requires
that
the
state
court
interest
be
superior,
and
that
the
state
court
bears
responsibility
for
trial
on
the
merits
and
for
all
appropriate
relief.
concern
that
the
litigation
may
be
motivated
by
improper
considerations
should
not
allow
the
board
to
subject
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit
to
an
administrative
trial
of
the
civil
complaint
in
order
to
assess
his
motive
by
evaluating
the
factual
and
the
legal
support
for
his
civil
claims.
if
the
board
does
intend
to
determine
that
the
weakness
in
a
plaintiff's
suit
justifies
an
inference
that
the
suit
was
brought
for
retaliatory
purposes
and
is
therefore
an
unfair
labor
practice,
then
the
board
must
await
the
decision
of
the
state
court,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state
court
fails
to
provide
sufficient
relief
to
accommodate
the
interests
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
board
still
has
the
ability
to
step
in
and
to
award
the
proper
relief.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
we
want
the
state
court
to
be
able
to
go
forward--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--but
without
interference
from
the
board.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
well,
in
the
linn
case,
and
in
the
farmers
case--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--well,
for
one
thing,
if
the
employer
has
to
go
forward
and
demonstrate
the
merit
of
his
suit
to
an
administrative
law
judge
and
to
the
board,
he
is
doing
so
under
the
possible
threat
that
his
suit
is
orderly
drawn.
that
is
certainly
an
interference
with
the
suit.
he
must
do
so
without
pretrial
confrontation
of
witnesses.
he
must
do
so
without
discovery.
he
must
do
so
without
a
civil
judge,
and
without
a
civil
jury.
and
if
he
fails
carrying
that
burden
to
prove
his
case
in
front
of
the
administrative
law
judge,
then
me
might
be
ordered
to
have
his
suit
withdrawn
and
to
pay
the
other
side's
expenses.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
i
would
not
presume
that
that
would
happen
in
all
cases,
but--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--well,
it
might,
but--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i
am
not
sure
that
a
victory
in
the
state
court
would
be
meaningful
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
national
labor
relations
board--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--well,
i
don't
know
that
the
board
would
not
try
and
interfere
in
some
way
with
those
damages.
for
example,
the
board
might
rule
that
the
employer
has
no
right
to
collect
those
damages.
we
don't
know,
because
this
is
a
new
area
for
the
board.
the
board
has
not
in
the
past
extended
itself
this
way.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
your
honor,
i
construe
linn
and
farmers
to
require
that.
in
the
linn
case,
this
court
said--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--no,
no
such--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--no
such
ruling
was
necessary
in
the
linn
case,
but
i
think
it's
a
necessary
corollary
in
the
linn
case.
i
would
submit
that
this
court
could
not
have
intended
to
allow
state
courts
to
have
pre-emptive
jurisdiction
to--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--all
right.
let
me
correct
that.
pre-emptive
is
not
a
good
word
to
use.
i
don't
believe
this
court
would
have
allowed
the
state
courts
to
have
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
well,
all
right.
i
stand
corrected.
let
me
say--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--excuse
me?
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
if
the
state
court
under
linn
is
not
pre-empted
from
going
forward--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--yes,
but
it...
i
don't
think
it
would
be
consistent
with
linn
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
have
the
right
to
make
a
preliminary
disposition
of
the
merits
of
the
state
court
suit
in
order
to
decide
if
the
state
court
can
go
forward,
and
that's
what
the
board
is
asking
here.
the
board
is
saying,
even
if
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction
under
linn--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--well,
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i
think
that
the
board
cannot
interfere
with
a
pending
state
suit.
i
think
the
board
cannot
go
forward
because
there
are
procedures
that
the
employer
will
be
required
to
go
through
in
the
board
that
will
adversely
impact
on
his
ability
to
go
forward
in
the
state
case.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
i
mean
the
latter.
if
the
employer
were
alleged
to
have
committed
a
series
of
unfair
labor
practices,
one
of
which
was
the
filing
of
a
civil
suit
which
is
alleged
to
be
retaliatory,
i
would
certainly
concede
that
the
board
can
go
forward
to
adjudicate
the
other
unfair
labor
practices,
and
perhaps
to
look
at
the
entire
pattern
and
say,
this
employer
is
engaged
in
a
course
of
conduct
which
constitutes
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
must
be
stopped,
but
even
in
such
circumstances,
the
board
could
not
restrain
the
pending
state
court
suit.
once
the
state
court
suit
had
run
its
course,
and
informed
by
the
decision
and
the
findings
in
the
state
court,
the
board
might
then
decide
to
supplement
the
relief
it
had
provided
by
a
further
order
enjoining
the
commencement
perhaps
of
subsequent
state
court
proceedings
which
might
be
a
part
of
that
same
pattern
and
practice
of
coercive
conduct.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
no,
your
honor.
the
board's
authority
to
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
based
on
a
threat
to
file
a
lawsuit
is
not
challenged
here,
nor
is
the
board's
authority
to
enjoin
an
employer's
intention
to
commence
something
if
there
is
sufficient
substantial
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
employee
is
going
to
engage
in
some
conduct,
including
perhaps
a
suit
which
would
be
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
of
course
that
is
not
this
case.
our
case
is
one
in
which
a
state
court--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
that
is
not
only
my
contention,
justice
o'connor.
it
is
what
the
board
has
held
for
many,
many
years.
one
year
before
our
civil
suit
was
filed,
the
board
decided
the
case
of
essie
nichols
marcey,
in
1977,
cited
in
our
papers.
in
that
case,
the
employer
had
threatened
to
file
a
lawsuit
and
the
employer
had
filed
a
lawsuit.
the
board
found
the
threat
to
file
the
lawsuit
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board
found
that
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
itself
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
agree
with
that
decision.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
the
first
case
that
comes
to
mind,
your
honor,
is
the
1960
case,
i
believe
it
is,
of
clyde
taylor,
although
i
remember
the
clyde
taylor
overruled
a
case
called
w.t.
carter,
which
may
have
been
on
the
same
issue.
the
w.t.
carter
case
and
the
clyde
taylor
case
are,
of
course,
opposites.
in
clyde
taylor
there
was
a
finding
that
the
employer
had
as
part
of
a
bad
faith
effort
to
stop
a
union
campaign
filed
a
civil
suit.
nevertheless,
the
board
in
that
1960
case,
adopting
the
dissent
in
w.t.
carter,
decided
many
years
before,
held
that
even...
without
specifically
saying
so,
the
court
held
that
even
the
bad
faith
motive
which
it
had
found
would
not
deprive
the
employer
of
the
right
to
file
a
civil
action
in
court,
because
the
right
of
an
individual
to
go
to
court,
to
seek
judicial
protection
of
his
claims,
was
too
important
to
be
declared
an
unfair
labor
practice.
what
the
board
has
done
in
the
23
years
since
clyde
taylor
is
really
reverse
itself
almost
completely.
we--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
let
me
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may,
congress
has
provided
some
circumstances,
by
statute,
in
which
the
board
may
seek
to
protect
federal
interests
even
when
there
is
a
pending
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
no,
i
would
not
say
that.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
i
don't
read
the
statute,
your
honor,
as
saying
the
board
has
the
right
to
enjoin
a
state
court
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstand.
if
the
state
court
proceeding
directly
interferes--
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
--with
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
performance
of
its
functions,
yes.
then
it
does
have
the
right
to
enjoin
that
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
not
where
the
board
has
to
try
and
adjudicate
the
state
court
action
in
order
to
determine
what
the
underlying
motive
is
for
the
proceeding.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
the
state
court
action
on
its
face
interferes
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
or
interferes
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
recognize
that
the
board
has
some
expertise
in
evaluating
an
employer's
motivation
for
suit,
and
some
interest
in
the
prevention
of
retaliatory
suits,
but
we
submit
that
an
employer's
request
for
judicial
relief
stands
on
a
different
footing
from
any
other
kind
of
conduct
that
might
be
coercive
or
directly
interfering
with
employee
rights.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
i
think
all
suits
are
coercive,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
and
i
think
plaintiffs
in
all
civil
suits,
especially
in
suits
arising
out
of
labor
disputes,
are
likely
to
bear
some
ill
will
toward
the
defendants.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
in
order
for
the
suit
to
be
coercive
in
such
a
manner
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
can
intervene,
the
suit
has
to
ask
for
relief
which
is
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
or
the
suit
has
to
include
some
procedure,
for
example,
a
specific
abuse
of
process
which
interferes
with
the
conduct
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
or
with
the
national
labor
relations
act.
your
honor,
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
allen
katz
i
have
nothing
further
to
add,
your
honor.
