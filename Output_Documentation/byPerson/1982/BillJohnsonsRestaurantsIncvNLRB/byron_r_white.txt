justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
clearly
a
state
law
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
was
the
result,
as
justice
powell
asked?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
he
file
an
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
was
his
reason
for
denying
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
any
appeal
taken
from
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
how
do
you
read
the
national
labor
relations
board
views
in
this
case?
in
order
to
make
out
the
unfair
labor
practice
which
they
found,
according
to
them,
is
it
necessary
to
prove
not
only
an
anti-union
bias
or
a
harassment,
but
also
that
the
action
have
no
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
what
the
administrative
law
judge
said,
but
i
don't
read
the
board
as
relying
on
that
other
factor
at
all,
just
a
finding
that
the
suit
was
motivated
by
an
anti-union
bias
or
by
retaliation.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
the
suit
has
any
foundation
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
even...
assume
that
it
does
have
a
foundation
in
fact.
the
board
would
still
find
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
that's
true
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
reviewing
the
board
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
would
require
that
the
suit
have
no
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
must
the
board
hold
its
hand?
why
must
the
board
hold
his
hand?
why
shouldn't
the...
if
the
state
court
can
go
forward,
why,
well
and
good.
but
that
is
all
you
want,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what...
how
is
it
interfering
with
your
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
is
it
interfering
with
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
usually
you
could
get
to
trial
in
a
libel
case
in
a
state
court
before
the
board
would
ever
reach
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
a
lot
of
them,
it
would,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
you
won
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not.
you
may
be
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
you
would
nevertheless
have
damages
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
where
we
have
said
that
not
only
may
the
state
court
go
forward,
but
that
the
board
must
defer
to
the
state
proceedings?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
was
no
issue...
i
don't
remember
we
ruled
that
made
any
such
ruling
as
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
the
board
couldn't
go
forward
with
its
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
pre-emptive?
we
didn't
say
it
was
pre-emptive.
you
just
said
they
weren't
pre-empted.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
didn't
even
say
they
had
primary
jurisdiction.
we
just
said
they
had
jurisdiction
to
go
forward.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that's
all
we
said.
we
just
said
they
were
not
pre-empted
from
going
forward.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
said
the
interests
of
the
two
proceedings
were
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree.
that
is
a
different
question.
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that...
if
you
win
on
that
issue,
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
the
board
can't
go
forward.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
would
say
is,
the
board
shouldn't
interfere
with
the
state
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
corwin,
i
am
sure
you
will
make
it
clear
as
to
what
the
board's
position
is
as
to
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
labor
law,
national
labor
law,
the
board
must
find
not
only
that
the
suit
is
retaliatory
or
harassing
or
in
bad
faith,
but
also
that
the
state
suit
has
no
basis
in
fact
in
order
to
make
out
the
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
he
wouldn't
have...
so
that
if
he
has
the
unlawful
motivation,
that's...
the
unfair
labor
practice
is
complete
at
that
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
and
if
they
find
that
his
motivation
is
anti-union
or
whatever
it
takes
to
make
an
unfair
labor
practice,
it
could
be
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
would
be
found
even
if,
even
if
on
any
objective
basis
the
lawsuit
had...
wasn't
frivolous,
or
that
it
had
a
foundation
in
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
and
i
would
suppose
it
would
consider
whether
or
not
the
suit
had
a
foundation
in
fact,
but
even
if
they
found
that
it
had
a
foundation
in
fact,
it
could
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that's
the
way
i
read
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
your
brief,
the
answer
would
be
yes,
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
concede
all
the
anti-union
animus
there
is,
but
what
if
there's...
what
if
this
case
is
well
grounded
in
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
had
in
your
brief
already.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
brought
a
complaint...
he
pursued
a
complaint
when
the
district
judge,
the
united
states
district
judge
had
said
that
the
state
court
suit
was
not
frivolous,
and
it
had
a
basis
in
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
general
counsel
decided
not
to
pursue
that
in
the
court
system,
but
to
take
it
to
the
board,
and
he
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
failed.
and
it
failed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
found
it
right
on
the
point
of
whether
there
was
a
decent
basis
for
the
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
was
one
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
now
sounds
like
you
have
answered
the
question
you
were
very
reluctant
to
answer
a
while
ago,
if
you
answered
yes
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
it
is
only
relevant
to
determination
of
motive,
and
it
is
not
an
independent
factor
required
to...
for
the
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
correct?
that
it
is
not
an
independent
factor?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
have
answered
the
question.
yes,
and
you
really
answered
it
yes,
it
seems
to
me.
if
the
basic
inquiry
is
motive,
bad
motive,
and
lack
of
merit
of
the
suit
is
simply
an
element
that
goes
to
make
up
bad
motive,
now,
am
i
faithfully
following
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
just
expressed
absolutely
no
reluctance.
you
said
it
is
only
relevant
to
determining
motive.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that,
that
that
is
what
the...
it
seems
to
me
we
really
ought
to
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
i
thought
they
had
relied
on...
i
agree
with
justice
stevens,
they
had
relied
on
the
lack
of
reasonable
basis
as
an
independent
required
element
in
the
proof
of
the
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
they
may
have
violated
chainery
for
affirming
on
a
ground
that
you
say
the
board
doesn't
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
corwin,
ms.
corwin,
you...
i
don't
know
whether
you
were
up
here
for
the
argument
in
the
wright-line
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there,
the
board
eschewed
any
suggestion
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
was
complete
upon
proof
of
motivation,
that
if
the
employer
could
come
back
and
prove
that
a
non-discriminatory
or
a
non-biased
ground
would
have
caused
him
to
discharge
the
person
anyway,
it
wasn't
an
unfair
labor
practice
at
all.
why
shouldn't
the...
in
this
case,
the
employer
be
permitted
to
come
back
and
say,
i
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
lawsuit
and
i
would
have
filed
it
anyway--
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
if
i
had
an
anti-union
bias.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
he
may
have.
but
on
your
position,
he
wouldn't...
it
would
be
irrelevant.
the
board
would
say
to
him,
don't
waste
our
time.
once
the
motivation
is
proved,
the
case
is
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
were
found
that
the
lawsuit
was
well
grounded
in
fact,
and
in
state
law,
it
would
be
difficult
to
say,
wouldn't
it,
that
part
of
the
motive
of
filing
the
lawsuit
was
to
vindicate
the
employer's
reputation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
responded
well
enough.
