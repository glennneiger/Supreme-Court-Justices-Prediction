we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
bill
johnson's
restaurants
against
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
katz,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
saying,
i
take
it,
that
the
statute,
the
federal
statute,
2283,
i
think,
has
not
expressly
authorized
this
kind
of
restraint
to
be
put
on
the
board.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
scope
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
inquiry
to
determine
whether
there
is
harassment
that
would
interfere
with
the
board's
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understand...
let
me
see
if
i
understand
your
argument.
first
your
argument
is
that
congress
has
not
expressly
or
otherwise
authorized
any
interference
by
the
federal
courts
with
the
state
court
proceedings,
that's
number
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
number
two,
and
they
have
not
shown
that
it
was
necessary
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board,
which
is
the
second
leg
of
the
statute.
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
second
statement
that
i
just
postulated
to
you.
if
it
interferes
with
the
jurisdiction
and
functioning
of
the
labor
board,
then
they
can
enjoin
the
state
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
it
that
the
statute
says?
i'm
just
relying
on
the
statute,
which
i
would
assume
for
your
case
you
ought
to
be
relying
on.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
interferes
with
the
labor
board's--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
say
it
does
not
interfere
with
it
here,
and
on
the
other
leg
of
the
statute,
it
is
not
an
interference
which
has
been
expressly
authorized
by
congress.
the
statute
is
expressly
authorized
by
an
act
of
congress.
this
is
not
such
a
suit,
you
say,
this
interference.
this
federal
injunction
has
never
been
expressly
authorized
by
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
this
setting
it
must
be
coercive
in
a
specific
way
under
the
federal
statute,
that
is,
coercive
in
the
way
that
it
interferes
with
the
exercise
of
the
union's
guaranteed
rights.

justice

chief
justice

maybe
this
is

[generallaughter.]
maybe
this
is
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
state
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
katz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fine.
very
well.
thank
you,
counsel.
the
case
is
submitted.
