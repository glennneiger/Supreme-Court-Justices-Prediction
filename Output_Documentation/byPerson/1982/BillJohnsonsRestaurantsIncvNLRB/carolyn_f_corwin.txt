ms.

f.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
justice
white,
the
response
to
that
is
that
the
issue
before
the
board
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
whether
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
whether
there
has,
for
example,
been
a
coercive
interference
with
protection
of
rights,
employee
rights
under
section
7.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
the
issue
that
the
board
considers
in
a
situation
like
this
one,
in
which
the
allegation
is
that
the
bringing,
the
filing
and
prosecution
of
the
civil
suit
itself
is
coercive
conduct,
and
is
thus
an
unfair
labor
practice,
is
essentially
the
motivation
of
the
employer--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--to
the...
there
are
a
number
of
different
sorts
of
evidence
that
can
be
used.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
the
unlawful
motivation
is
the
central
focus
of
the
inquiry.
the
board
has
recognized
that
the
filing
of
a
civil
suit
for
the
purpose
of
retaliation
has
an
inherently
coercive
effect,
and
to
that
extent
effect
is
part
of
the
calculus,
but
the
board's
essential
inquiry
in
a
charge
like
this
is,
what
is
the
employer's
motivation.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
that
the
board
frequently
considers
many
different
sorts
of
evidence.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
think
that
is
conceivable,
but
i
think
the
board
looks
at
many
different
sorts
of
evidence,
including
whether
the
suit
has
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
have
to
say
that
i
don't
think
there
has
been
a
case
like
that
before
the
board.
it
is
certainly
not
this
case,
in
which
there
were
a
lot
of
different
kinds--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i...
my
answer
to
that
is
that
a
case
like
that
has
not
arisen.
i
think
it
is
an
open
question
before
the
board.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
in
this
case
you
have
many
different
sorts
of
evidence
that
the
board
found.
you
have
the
statements
of
the
employer's
supervisors
to
get
even
with
the
employees.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
am
simply
reluctant
to
commit
the
board
at
this
point
to
that
sort
of
hypothetical.
it
seems
to
me
that--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
board
does
in
this
area
is
an
accommodation.
the
clyde
taylor
rule,
which
is
still
in
full
effect,
requires
the
board...
the
board
has
made
the
judgment
that
it
must
accommodate
the
interest
to
litigate
with
the
concern
for
rights
under
the
act,
and
i
think
that
the
board
may
never
be
faced
with
the
hypothetical
you
suggest.
it
may
just
not
be
very
likely.
it
is
not
clear
that
the
general
counsel
would
ever
bring
such
a
complaint
before
the
board.
i
am
simply--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
think
the
district--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--yes.
that's
correct,
and
that
is
the
normal
procedure
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
in
this
case,
i
think
there
was
an
initial
effort
to
get
temporary
relief,
and--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--that's
correct.
the
district
judge
was--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
think
that
was
not
the
only
point
in
the
district
judge's
mind.
i
think
the
transcript
to
which
mr.
katz
referred--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
the
transcript
reflects
that
the
district
judge
was
quite
reluctant
to
step
in
at
that
point.
the
district
judge
had
before
it
the
affidavits,
but
did
not
have
the
four
days
of
administrative
hearings
that
the
administrative
law
judge
of
the
board
had,
and
was
quite
reluctant
to
step
in
and
order
the
suit
to
be
stopped.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know
the
order
of
magnitude.
i
think
co-counsel
has
indicated
that
there
are
approximately
100,
but
i
myself
have
not--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--indeed
not,
and
that
is
not
what
the
administrative
law
judge
attempts
to
do
in
a
case
like
that.
the
issue
before
the
board
is
not
the
merits
of
the
state
court
claim.
the
issue
before
the
board
is
the
motive
of
the
employer
in
bringing
a
suit
like
this.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
don't
want
to
try
to
evade
the
question.
the
concern
is
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
the
board
has
attempted
to
accommodate
interests,
and
i
hesitate
to
commit
the
board
before
it
faces
a
case
of
the
sort
that
you
are
describing.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
no.
no,
i
must
go
further
to
explain.
they
look
at
a
number
of
different
types
of
evidence,
all
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
suit
is
motivated
for
a
protected
activity
or
anti-union
animus.
there
are
many
different
sorts
of
evidence,
and
one
that
employers
frequently
urge
and
in
fact
which
this
employer
urged
is
that
the
administrative
law
judge
take
a
look
to
see
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
in
fact
for
the
suit.
here,
the
employer...
the
petitioner
urged
at
the
administrative
law
judge
stage
that
it
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
suit,
and
the
general
counsel
responded
with
evidence
on
that
point.
the
finding
of
the
administrative
law
judge
was
not
addressed
to
the
merits
of
that
claim.
it
was
not
the
same
sort
of
inquiry
as
the
state
court.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
was
addressed
to
the
reasonable
basis
of
the
suit
as
one
indication
of
the
motive
of
the
employer.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
think
that
the
judge
may
need
to
know
something
about
whether
a
particular
statement
is
true
or
false.
i
think
perhaps
the
broad
outlines
most
administrative
law
judges
would
be
familiar
with.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
of
the
state...
of
the
components
of
libel
law,
for
example,
the
truth
or
falsity
of
a
statement.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
the
inquiry
of
the
administrative
law
judge
is
very
limited,
and
to
the
extent
there
is
an
examination
of
this
reasonable
basis
concept,
it
is
confined
to
the
sorts
of
questions
like,
is
the
statement
true
or
false,
is
there
any
indication
that
there
was
malice.
it
is
really
a
very--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
that
if
one
gets
into
the
sort
of
questions
that
require
further
legal
analysis
or
further
inquiry
into
state
law,
i
simply
don't
think
that's
the
sort
of
thing
the
administrative
law
judge
is
going
to
do.
it
is
a
very
basic
inquiry.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
the
inquiry
of
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
lawsuit
is
not
the
same
inquiry
as
who
is
going
to
prevail
under
the
particular
state
law,
and
how
the
merits--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
in
this
case,
for
example,
you
had
the
employer
state
that
it
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
lawsuit
because
on
the
face
of
it
simply...
it
simply
stated
state
law
claims,
and
that
was
the
end
of
that,
and
you
had
the
employer
saying,
i
filed
the
lawsuit
because
i
felt
that
i
was
personally
attacked
for
filthy
restrooms
and
unwarranted
sexual
advances.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
he
looked
at
some
very
basic
facts
of
the
case.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
no,
i
don't
argue
that
he
didn't
look
at
the
merits.
i
suggest
he
did
not
have
the
task
of
deciding
the
merits,
and
in
fact
what
he
did
in
this
case
was
to
see
whether
the
employer
had
presented
any
evidence
that
might
support
some
sort
of
a
reasonable
basis
for
bringing
the
suit.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
that
is
one
possibility.
i
think
it
depends
on
what
the
employer
suggests.
the
employer
could
come
forward
and
say,
i
thought
such
and
such
was
true
because
people
informed
me
of
x
or
y.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
again,
i
would
have
to
reiterate
that
the
board
is
concerned
with
what
the
employer's
motive
is.
the
board
inquiry
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
what
sort
of
intent
did
an
employer
have,
what
sort
of
effect
does
the
conduct
have.
is
this--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--yes.
it
is
an
indicator.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
is
an
indication
among
many
of
what
the
employer's
motive
was,
whether
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
protected
activity.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that
is
correct,
and
i
didn't
mean
to--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--that's...
it
only
goes
to
the
question
of
motive,
of
the
employer's
motive.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
my
reluctance
to
address
that
is--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--it
is
certainly
relevant
to
determining
motive,
but
my
concern
is
that
i
don't
know
how
the
board
would
weigh
the
evidence
in
a
suit
such
as
the
one
that
you
suggest.
i
think
it
is
certainly
correct
to
say
that
the
reasonable
basis
inquiry
goes
to
motive.
it
is
simply
that
i
don't
know
whether
there
would
ever
be
a
case
in
which
that
was
the
only
evidence
of
intent.
i
think
it
is
far
more
likely
that
you
are
going
to
have
what
you
have
in
this
situation,
in
which
you
have
evidence
of
the
employer
making
statements
ahead
of
time,
a
week
ahead
of
time,
that
petitioner
would
get
even
with
these
employees,
and
particularly
with
mrs.
helton,
one
of
the
waitresses
who
had
filed
a
charge
with
the
board.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
yes.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
we
have
not
questioned
that.
i
think
i
can
say
that
we
would
accept
that.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that
is
correct.
at
least
to
enforce
the
court's
cease
and
desist
order
requiring
dismissal
of
that
suit.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that
is
the
result
only
after
the
board
has
found
that
the
filing
and
prosecution
of
the
suit
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
the
employees
for
the
exercise
of
their
protected
rights.
only
after
finding
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute,
the
federal
labor
laws,
does
the
board
then
identify
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
provide
a
remedy
for
that.
in
this
case,
the
remedy
is
dismissal
of
the
civil
suit
and
reimbursement
of
legal
expenses.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
decides
whether
the
employer
has
violated
the
federal
statute.
that
is
the
inquiry
of
the
board.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
in
fact,
yes,
that
is
what
occurred
in
this
case.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
yes,
that's
correct.
the
state
suit
was
prosecuted
through
several
stages.
on
the
day
that
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
that's
correct.
some
depositions
were
taken.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
did
not
go
to
trial.
there
was
a
preliminary
injunction
stage
at
which
the
court
denied
a
preliminary
injunction
to
the
employer
and
vacated
the
temporary
restraining
order.
there
were
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment,
and
that
occurred
after
the
administrative
law
judge
hearing
but
before
the
final
decision
came
out
from
the
administrative
law
judge.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
the
board's
reaction
to
that
development,
had
it
occurred,
which
it
did
not
in
this
case,
but
had
it
occurred,
i
think
would
depend
on
the
circumstances
in
which
that
judgment
were
entered.
if
it
were,
for
example,
a
default
judgment
because
the
waitresses
here
couldn't
afford
to
hire
a
lawyer
and
to
pursue
the
suit
to
that
extent,
i
don't
think
the
board
would
feel
constrained
by
any
default
judgment,
for
example.
if
it
were
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
i
think
again
it
would
depend
on
what
the
board
could
identify
in
the
decision
as
relevant
to
its
inquiry
into
motive.
i
think
obviously
the
board
would
think
twice
about
what
a
state
court
had
found
on
the
merits,
but
again,
it's
conceivable
that
a
trial
court
would
err
in
the
state
and
that
the
employee
wouldn't
have
the
money
to
pursue
an
appeal.
the
waitresses
in
this
case
may
not
be
able
to
pursue
this
sort
of
litigation
through
to
the
state
supreme
court,
and
again
the
board
might
consider
a
situation
like
that.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
again,
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
in
this
case,
there
were
two
causes
of
action.
one
was
a
business
interference
claim
which
was
dismissed
by
the
state
court.
the
libel
action
is
still
alive.
but
again,
i
suggest
it
would
really
depend
on
the
circumstances.
i
think
the
board
might
well
take
something
like
that
into
account
if
it
were
convinced
that
the
waitresses
had
been
able
to
be
represented
by
good
legal
counsel
that
pursued
their
claims
and
that
in
fact
the
determination
was
an
appropriate
one
in
light
of
the
procedural
circumstances
here.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
relied
not
only
on
the
lack
of
reasonable
basis
in
fact,
but
i
think
it
recognized
that
there
were
other
indications,
other
significant
indications,
such
as
the
statement
about
getting
even,
the
statement
by
a--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
have
tried
to
suggest
that
the
reasonable
basis
inquiry
is
simply
an
element
of
the
conclusion
as
to
whether
the--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
spent
considerable
time
on
the
reasonable
basis
point,
but
i
think
it,
too,
recognized
that
it
goes
to
whether
the
motive
of
the
employer
is
one
that
violates
the
federal
labor
laws.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
that
was
a
significant--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
don't
read
the
court
of
appeals
decision
that
way.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
refer
to
the
other
sorts
of
evidence
that
the
get
even
evidence,
the
circumstances
of
the
lawsuit.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
simply
don't
read
them
as
having
affirmed
on
that
basis.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
it
seems
to
me
that
they
had
a
lot
of
things
in
mind,
and
that
obviously
the
discussion
of
the
evidence
took
up
more
room
in
the
opinion
than
the
statements
about
the
get
even
and
the
circumstances
of
the
suit.
i
don't
know
what
to
respond
about
a
remand,
because
i
simply
think...
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
read
to
use
reasonable
basis
as
an
indication
of
whether
there
was
in
fact
a
motive
or
not.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
yes.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--in
fact,
i
think
that's
what
the
employer
tried
to
do
in
this
case.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
indeed
not.
i
think
the
board
considers
carefully
the
employer's
reasonable
basis
argument
that
the
board
considers
that
this
can
be
something
that
might
tend
to
countervail
other
evidence
of
motive.
i
think
that
the
analogy
perhaps
to
the
issue
you
are
raising
in
the
transportation
management,
the
wright-line
test,
is
that
this
might
be
analogized
to
a
pretext
case
in
which
only
one
motive
was
found.
it
is
not
a
dual
motive
case
here.
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
the
reason
for
filing
the
suit
was
to
retaliate
against
mrs.
helton
for
filing
her
charge,
her
initial
charge,
and
to
harass
the
employees
for
having
engaged
in
their
protected
activity,
and
it
concluded
that
there
was
no
other
motive.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
that
is
part
of
my
reluctance
in
responding
to
your
hypothetical,
because
i
think
the--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--in
a
case
like
that,
i
think
the
general
counsel
might
hesitate,
and
think
that
the
evidence
was
close,
and
that
the
motivation
was
not
as
clear
as
it
was
in
a
case
such
as
this
one.
in
this
sort
of
case,
i
think
petitioner's
view
takes
you
to
the
conclusion
that
a
particular
sort
of
coercive
conduct
that
may
be
analogous
to
other
sorts
of
coercive
conduct
that
employers
use,
that
that...
the
particular
form
of
conduct
that
this
employer
chose
somehow
ought
to
be
immunized
from
the
coverage
of
the
federal
labor
laws.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i
am
not
aware
of
anything
in
the
legislative
history.
i
think
one
can
look
to
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute
and
in
a
case
such
as
the
retaliatory
suit
we
have
here,
one
can
say,
it
fits
fairly
clearly
within
the
language
of
the
statute,
in
that
it's
intended
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
protected
rights,
it's
intended
to
discriminate
against
the
employee
for
the
invocation
of
the
processes
of
the
board,
so
i
think
our
starting
point
is,
it
comes
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
now,
this
court
has
on
several
occasions
indicated
that
the
board
has
considerable
discretion
to
identify
unfair
labor
practices.
they
are
not
enumerated
in
the
act.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
yes,
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
i
think
here
we
can
look
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
this
kind
of
conduct
falls
pretty
clearly
within
it.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
mr.
katz
referred
to
the
carter
suit,
which
was
quite
early
on.
i
don't
have
the
date.
it
must
be
around
1950
or
so.
there
have
been
a
series
of
suits
involving
various
factual
situations,
and--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--i
am
simply
unaware
of
any.
i
suspect
that
there
were
not,
but
i
really
don't
know.
the
rule
that
the
board
follows
and
has
followed
since
1960
is
the
one
referred
to
as
the
clyde
taylor
rule,
and
that
is
that
the
general
practice
of
the
board
is
to
not
find
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
case
of
good
faith
litigation.
that
is
the
general
rule,
and
that
continues
to
be
applied
today.
however,
the
board
has
recognized
that
in
a
case
like
this,
when
you
have
employees
who
are
just
faced
with
the
devastating
effect
of
a
retaliatory
suit,
a
suit
for
half
a
million
dollars
in
punitive
damages,
that
that
can
provide
such
a
coercive
effect
that
at
least
in
the
case
where
you
have
clear
proof
of
retaliation,
that
the
suit
was
brought
for
the
purpose
of
harassment,
that
here
you
have
an
unfair
labor
practice,
here
you
have
to
step
apart
from
the
general
rule
of
clyde
taylor
and
conclude
that
this
sort
of
retaliatory
suit
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
think--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
to
some
extent,
they
have
been
accommodated
already
in
the
general
rule
that
good
faith
litigation
will
not
be
the
basis
for
an
unfair
labor
practice.
in
the
narrow
class
of
cases
we
are
talking
about
here,
where
the
board
has
found
that
the
suit
is
brought
for
the
purpose
of
harassment,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
can
vindicate
the
federal
right,
that
you
can
protect
the
employee
rights
that
the
act
guarantees
and
that
you
can
deter
the
sort
of
coercive
employer
conduct
you
have
here
without
issuing
a
cease
and
desist
order
as
you
would
against
any
unfair
labor
practice,
telling
the
employer
to
stop.
and
i
think
that
there
simply
isn't
another
remedy
that
is
going
to
be
very
effective.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
reimbursement
of
legal
expenses
may
get
you
part
of
the
way
there,
but
it
doesn't
do
anything
to
solve
the
question
of
the
employees,
these
waitresses,
who
are
forced
to
engage
legal
counsel,
to
pay
out
a
lot
of
expenses
on
things
like
depositions
and
trials
and
so
on.
that
is
the
sort
of
coercive
conduct
the
act
was
designed
to
deter
and
to
prevent,
and
to
provide
a
remedy
for.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
one
can
provide
that
sort
of
remedy
by
simply
saying,
all
right,
we
will
let
this
unfair
labor
practice
proceed.
that
is
simply
not
the
sort
of
remedy
that
congress
intended
in
the
case
of
coercive
conduct
of
a
particularly
devastating
type
like
the
suit
you
have
here.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
well,
i
think
that
the...
what
occurred
in
this
case
is
an
example
of
what
can
happen.
even
with
a
suit
like
that,
the
employees
were
notified
on
monday
morning
that
a
temporary
restraining
order
hearing
would
be
held
at
noon.
they
attended
that.
they
had
an
order
entered
against
them.
they
were
served
with
a
complaint
for
half
a
million
dollars.
and
the
employer
sought
to
take
their
depositions
beginning
the
following
wednesday,
two
days
later.
i
think
you
have
to
do
a
lot
of
sorting
out--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i...
that's--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
that
is
true
for
part
of
the
litigation
here.
the
libel
claim
is
still
pending.
the
state
court--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--well,
i
think
for
purposes
of
federal
law
you
do.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
state
court
is
required
by
federal
law
to
defer
to
the
board's
finding.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
i'm
sorry?
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
no,
it
is
not.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
my
understanding
is,
it
has
been
held
in
abeyance.
that
is,
the
libel
portion
of
the
suit
has
been
held
in
abeyance--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--pending
the
outcome--
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
--yes.
ms.
carolyn
f.
corwin
yes,
that
is
correct.
