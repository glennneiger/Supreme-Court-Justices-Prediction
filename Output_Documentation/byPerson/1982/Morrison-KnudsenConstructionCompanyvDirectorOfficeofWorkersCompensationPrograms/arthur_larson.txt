mr.
arthur
larson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
under
the
longshoremen's
compensation
act
should
employer
contributions
into
union
trust
funds
for
health
and
welfare,
pensions
and
training
for
the
first
time
in
history
be
included
in
the
concept
of
the
individual's
average
weekly
wage
for
purposes
of
calculating
his
benefits,
adding
on
the
average
of
30
%
to
40
%
to
those
benefits
which
now
stand
at
88
%
of
take-home
pay?
the
legal
issue,
of
course,
is
the
intent
of
congress.
unfortunately,
all
the
three
major
indicators
of
that
intent,
the
clear
language
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
and
of
its
amendments,
and
above
all,
the
fact
that
congress
could
not
possibly
have
intended
an
interpretation
of
the
act
that
would
severely
damage
the
functioning
of
the
act
and
its
ability
to
carry
out
its
purposes.
first,
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
why
this
case
came
as
such
a
bombshell
to
the
compensation
community.
workers'
compensation
has
been
with
us
for
70
years
and
the
longshoremen's
act
for
55.
during
that
time
literally
tens
of
millions
of
cases
have
been
disposed
of
on
the
understanding
that
wages
meant
wages
along
with
traditional
non-cash
wage
substitutes
such
as
board
and
lodging.
now,
suddenly
we
are
being
told
that
all
those
thousands
of
judges
and
administrators
and
lawyers
and
employers
and
employees
and
unions
were
wrong
all
along
in
what
they
thought
wage
included
and
overnight
we
are
supposed
to
accept
a
new
meaning
of
wage
which,
believe
it
or
not,
will
raise
benefits
above
pre-injury
take-home
pay
and
all
this
by
judicial,
not
legislative
action.
mr.
arthur
larson
yes.
there
is
a
bill
pending
in
congress
right
now...
there
was
a
bill
last
year
which
passed
the
senate.
the
bill
pending
in
congress
now
has
a
small
clause
in
there
which
in
effect
would
undo
the
effect
of
this
for
the
future.
mr.
arthur
larson
so
far
this
year
i
don't
think
anything
has
happened.
mr.
arthur
larson
no,
they
took
no
action
last
year.
now,
of
course,
there
are
two
reasons
at
least
why
this
doesn't
really
affect
this
decision
very
much.
the
first
is,
as
we
all
know,
it
is
a
long
distance
between
introducing
a
bill,
especially
on
workers'
compensation,
and
getting
it
passed.
but,
the
other
is
that
even
if
it
were
passed,
enormous
damage
would
be
done
just
in
cases
now
pending.
a
lot
of
them
are
hanging
fire
right
at
the
moment.
but,
even
more
seriously,
under
the
very
permissive
reopening
provisions
of
the
longshoremen's
act,
tens
of
thousands
of
cases
would
be
reopened
on
the
theory
that
there
was
a
mistake
of
fact
in
the
determination
of
the
benefits.
so,
most
of
the
damaging
consequences,
as
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief,
would
happen.
mr.
arthur
larson
there
are,
of
course,
all
kinds
of
benefits
under
this
plan
and
the
various
others
that
occur
and
under
some
plans
the
medical
payments
go
on
during
disability
and
others
they
don't.
of
course,
in
the
case
of
death
cases,
they
would
not
go
on.
but,
what
we
keep
coming
back
to
in
this
case
is,
of
course,
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
intent
of
congress
is
very
well
expressed
in
this
case
in
the
short
but
very
specific
definition
we
have
been
provided
which
is
that
wages
means
the
money
rate
at
which
the
service
rendered
is
recompensed
under
the
contract
of
hire
in
force
at
the
time
of
injury,
including
the
reasonable
value
of
board,
room,
housing,
lodging,
or
similar
advantage
received
from
the
employer
and
gratuities
received
in
the
course
of
employment
from
others
than
the
employer.
now,
the
simplest
way
for
the
court
to
dispose
of
this--
mr.
arthur
larson
--the
principal
distinction...
this
is
the
one
that
has
always
controlled
these
cases
of
so-called
similar
advantage.
there
are
two
things:
similar
advantage
means,
if
it
means
anything,
having
a
clear
and
present
cash
value
now
and
also
being
paid
directly
by
the
employer
to
the
employee.
those
are
the
distinctions
under
which...
for
example,
vacation
pay
is
included
and
overtime
and
under
certain
circumstances
transportation.
well,
obviously,
the
fund
payments
aren't
the
money
rate.
that,
in
the
common
term,
is
the
cents
per
hours
paid
to
the
employee.
it
certainly
isn't
board,
it
isn't
lodging,
it
isn't
housing,
and,
as
i
have
just
indicated,
it
isn't
similar
advantage.
now,
there
is
another
way
this
court--
mr.
arthur
larson
--well,
i
think
in
almost
every
case
it
is
either
furnished
directly
or
the
money
is
furnished
directly,
but
it
has
a
present
cash
value
and
this
is
a
traditional
thing
and
it
is
written,
of
course,...
it
is
written
right
into
the
statute
so
it
can't
be
controversial.
mr.
arthur
larson
they
might,
yes,
but
they
are
not
paid
by
the
employer
to
the
employee.
that
is
one
of
the
difficulties.
and,
they
are
not
written
into
the
statute
as
part
of
the
definition
which
makes
a
crucial
distinction.
i
think
another...
a
simply
way
the
court
could
dispose
of
this
case
would
be
by
direct
application
of
the
rationale
of
potomac
electric
power
company
against
the
director
decided
by
this
court
just
two
terms
ago.
there
this
court
held
that
since
the
longshoremen's
act
was
copied
verbatim
from
the
new
york
one
and
since
it
employed
terms
which
had
accepted
meaning
in
1927
when
the
longshoremen's
act
was
passed,
congress
should
be
deemed
to
have
intended
the
meaning
that
prevailed
at
that
time.
now,
to
carry
out
over
to
the
present
situation,
it
is
only
necessary
to
observe
that
when
the
longshoremen's
act
was
first
passed
the
meaning
of
wages
that
we
are
talking
about
was
not
only
dominant,
which
is
the
word
in
pepco,
it
was
absolutely
universal.
but,
now
i
think
we
can
carry
this
down
to
the
present
more
cogently
by
applying
the
pepco
principle
to
the
1972
amendments
which
were
in
effect,
the
re-enactment...
they
were
such
massive
amendments...
particularly
because
the
central
concern
of
the
1972
amendments
was
exactly
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
the
benefit
level.
the
remedy
chosen
by
congress
to
deal
with
that
benefit
level
problem
was
to
make
the
ceiling
flexible
and,
indeed,
the
benefits
went
from
$70
a
week
to
$500.
now,
as
you
recall,
the
heart
of
the
1972
amendments
was
a
sort
of
trade
off
between
the
longshoreman
giving
up
his
rights
of
unseaworthiness
against
a
ship
in
exchange
for
a
dramatic
increase
in
compensation
benefits.
now,
the
point,
for
present
purposes,
is
that
in
striking
this
balance
everybody
had
to
start
from
a
common
understanding
of
what
wages
included.
if
it
had
ever
occurred
to
anybody
that
a
new
meaning
of
wage
was
going
to
come
along
that
would
in
itself
raise
the
benefits
30
%
to
40
%,
can
anybody
suppose
that
this
same
balance
would
have
been
struck.
this
was
not
an
oversight.
by
1972,
these
fund
contributions
into
union
plans
were
a
very
conspicuous
feature
of
the
labor
sea
and
congress
had
just
a
few
years
before
had
to
deal
with
it
in
connection
with
the
davis-bacon
act
which
has
a
sort
of
parallel
history
to
the
longshoremen's
act
and
it
dealt
with
it
by
simply
writing
a
detailed
provision
into
the
davis-bacon
act
spelling
out
that
union
fund
contributions
are
included
in
the
concept
of
wage.
now,
in
'72,
congress,
in
connection
with
the
longshoremen's
act,
theoretically
could
have
done
the
same
thing.
mr.
arthur
larson
yes.
mr.
arthur
larson
'64.
mr.
arthur
larson
yes.
congress
could
have
theoretically
done
this,
but
in
the
thousand
pages
of
testimony,
no
one
even
thought
of
suggesting
it,
not
because
they
weren't
aware
of
it,
but
it
just
didn't
occur
to
anybody
as
being
even
remotely
practical
and
there
were
a
lot
of
reasons
for
that,
but
i
think
the
most
obvious
is
that
while
the
davis-bacon
act
is
a
collective
figure
for
a
whole
area,
under
the
longshoremen's
act
you
have
to
determine
an
individualized
figure
for
every
single
employee
and
that
would
have
been
administratively
absolutely
impossible.
now,
as
to
the
third
and
final
part
of
the
congressional
intent,
i
am
going
to
take
again
as
my
text
a
passage
from
pepco
in
which
this
court
said
it
is
not
to
be
lightly
assumed
that
congress
intended
the
act
to
produce
incongruous
results.
well,
the
decision
below
would
produce
results
that
are
not
only
incongruous
but
severely
damaging
to
the
entire
functioning
of
the
system.
the
first
most
serious
damage
that
i
would
briefly
mention
and
that
is
that
benefits
would
actually
go
above
pre-injury
take-home
pay.
now,
this
is
the
ultimate
nightmare
of
workers'
compensation
or
any
social
insurance
system.
a
couple
of
quick
ways
to
demonstrate
this--
mr.
arthur
larson
--take-home
pay.
mr.
arthur
larson
well,
they
would
even
do
that
in
some
cases,
but
i
am
making
the
mildest--
mr.
arthur
larson
--in
many
cases
they
would
go
above
gross
pay.
in
high
salary
brackets,
they
definitely
would.
mr.
arthur
larson
yes.
they
would
definitely...
there
are
elaborate
calculations
in
some
of
our
briefs,
full
tables
of
what
would
happen.
and,
since
the
disparity
as
to
take-home
pay
obviously
has
a
lot
to
do
with
taxes,
the
higher
you
go
in
salary
brackets,
the--
mr.
arthur
larson
--they
do
now,
yes.
mr.
arthur
larson
they
do
now,
yes.
mr.
arthur
larson
there
would
be
a
great
difference
in
the
amount
by
which
they
exceeded.
mr.
arthur
larson
well,
the
comptroller
general
pointed
this
out
in
his
report
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
i
am
simply
quoting
him
when
he
says
that
in
some
cases
it
is
at
least
theoretically
possible
to
show
that
the
present
thing
could
go
above.
but,
what
would
happen
under
this
decision
below
is
practically
all
of
the
benefits,
and
certainly
on
the
average,
would
go
above
prior
take-home
pay.
take
the
atlantic
and
gulf
contract
for
example.
under
the
atlantic
and
gulf
contract,
which
is
typical
of
the
longshoremen's
contracts,
the
take
home
pay
for
a
year
averages
$20,200.
the
compensation
benefit
payable
on
that
is
$24,100
a
year.
mr.
arthur
larson
under
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
now,
needless
to
say,
the
impact--
mr.
arthur
larson
--twenty
thousand
two
hundred
is
the
take-home
pay.
mr.
arthur
larson
that...
i
can
give
you
the
exact
figures.
the
amount
paid
into
the
pension
fund,
the
contributions,
on
a
wage
of
$12.80
was
4.59.
mr.
arthur
larson
well,
the--
mr.
arthur
larson
--i
am
including
them
all,
of
course.
mr.
arthur
larson
no,
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
arthur
larson
but,
you
see,
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
in
the
last
amounts
of
this
incentive
to
the
worker
and
what
he
sees
obviously
is
if
he
works
he
gets
$20,200
and
if
he
doesn't
work
he
gets
$24,100
and
no
amount
of
talk
about
the
employee's
value
of
what
goes
into
the
fund
will
make
much
difference
to
him,
because,
you
see,
there
is
not
a
direct
pipeline
of
that
fund
contribution
from
the
employer
into
the
pockets
of
the
employee.
it
goes
into
a
trust
fund
and
he
may
or
may
not
some
day
profit
by
it.
mr.
arthur
larson
well,
they
wrote
this
into
the
act
definitely
because
room
and
board...
and,
of
course,
they
had
to
write
tips
in.
mr.
arthur
larson
he
doesn't
see
it
as
in
many
cases
he
never
will
see
it.
there
is
a
very
indirect
relation
between
what
goes
into
these
funds
and
what
comes
out.
for
example,
in
mr.
hilyer's
case,
he
didn't
work
long
enough
to
get
anything.
some
of
the
people
who
were
working
side
by
side
with
him
got
credit
for
years
and
years.
no
contributions
were
ever
paid.
that
is
the
nature
of
the
plan.
mr.
arthur
larson
that
is
right.
probably
the
most
damaging--
mr.
arthur
larson
--i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
arthur
larson
i
want
to
say
with
all
my
heart
that
nothing
in
the
world
can
compensate
people
for
the
loss
of
a
husband
and
the
compensation
act
never
has
pretended
to
do
anything
like
that.
it
doesn't
even
pay
for
pain
and
suffering.
it
doesn't
pay
for
loss
of
consortium.
it
doesn't
even
pay
all
your
wages
back
that
you
lose.
it
is
a
very
arbitrary
and
rough
and
ready
scheme
mainly
designed
so
that
it
will
be
virtually
automatic
and
self-executing.
less
than
a
month
ago
this
court
in
the
lockheed
case
put
its
finger
right
on
it.
it
said
the
purpose
of
workers'
compensation
is
to
pay
benefits
that
are
fixed
and
immediate
and
without
litigation.
well,
as
for
being
fixed,
they
won't
be
fixed
at
all
because
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
an
individual,
tailor-made
calculation
for
each
employee
in
relation
to
each
employer
as
to
each
fund,
and
some
employers
have
ten
of
them,
against
the
backdrop
of
controversy
about
what
kinds
of
benefits
should
go
in.
we
just
have
a
small
sample
here.
there
are
many,
many
others.
and,
the
worst
controversy
of
all
is
how
do
you
evaluate
all
these
assorted
plans?
some
are
on
a
per-hour
basis,
some
are
on
a
per-tonnage
basis,
some
of
them
are
on
an
arbitrary
actuarial
basis
in
which
the
employee
simply
pays
in
whatever
is
necessary.
so,
far
from
being
immediate,
the
benefits
would
be
delayed
by
years,
and
as
for
being
without
litigation,
of
course,
litigation
will
be
enormously
increased.
there
is
another
very
direct
way
in
which
the
worker
is
going
to
get
hurt.
let
me
just
say
here
i
think
everybody
realizes
that
this
whole
system
of
compensation
is
all
about
the
worker.
it
is
not
about
insurance
companies,
it
is
not
about
employers,
it
is
about
the
worker.
and,
if
the
system
gets
undermined,
the
worker
and
his
dependents
are
going
to
be
the
ones
that
ultimately
lose
and
this
is
one
of
the
ways
they
are
going
to
lose,
by
the
delay
in
their
payments
for
years,
whereas
now,
at
least
so
far
as
this
item
is
concerned,
they
are
virtually
automatic.
but,
there
is
another
way
that
could
even
be
more
seriously
damaging
to
particular
employees.
in
new
york
harbor,
for
example,
the
compensation
premium
is
$84
to
$87
per
hundred
of
payroll.
in
some
canadian
ports
that
are
competitive,
it
is
$3.00.
three
to
four
thousand
jobs
have
already
been
lost
from
new
york
harbor
to
canadian
points.
now,
that
may
partially
explain
the
fact
that
neither
the
international
longshoremen's
association
nor
any
other
union
of
longshoremen
has
joined
in
this
litigation.
in
the
district
of
columbia,
about
15,000
jobs
were
lost
in
six
years
largely
for
the
same
reasons
which
may
explain
the
fact
while
the
<aflcio>
[=afl-cio]
district
council
filed
a
brief
in
a
petition
for
certiorari,
they
have
not
filed
a
brief
on
the
matter.
mr.
arthur
larson
thank
you.
