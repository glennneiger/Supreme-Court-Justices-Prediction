justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
larson?
when
you
are
making
that
argument,
would
the
benefits
go
above...
you
say
above
take-home
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
above
gross
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
clearly
they
wouldn't
go
above
gross
pay
if
you
included
the
fringe
benefits
as
part
of
gross
pay?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
you
include
in
gross
pay
the
payments
to
the
pension
funds
and
the
like?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
is
true,
if
it
is
higher
than
gross
pay
even
including
fringe
benefits,
i
suppose
it
is
possible,
even
under
your
view,
that
benefits
may...
if
you
define
wages
the
way
you
argue,
benefits
may
in
some
cases
exceed
wages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
do
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
would
be
no
difference
under--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but,
the
mere
fact
that
they
exceed
is
not
a
critical
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
that
example,
$20,200
is
the
take-home
pay
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
would
the
comparable
figure
be
if
you
included
the
amounts
paid
to
the
pension
funds
on
behalf
of
that
employee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
the
figure
comparable
to
the
$20,200
figure?
is
it
more
than
$4,000?
i
think
it
is.
so,
you
actually
have
an
example
that
doesn't
support
your
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
really
comparing
oranges
with
apples
when
you
include
the
payments
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
$20,200
figures,
does
that
include
the
amounts
paid
into
the
pension
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
the
$24,000
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
have
made
a
similar
argument
in
1927
if
the
employee
had
a
very
low
take-home
pay,
but
got
free
room
and
board
and
a
lot
of
tips.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
leonard,
there
really
isn't
any
dispute
about
the
fact
that
the
fringe
benefits
are
benefits.
everybody
agrees
with
that.
let
me
ask
you
this
question
if
i
may.
is
it
not
correct
that
if
you
are
right
in
your
reading
of
the
word
"wages",
that
that
would
also
apply
to
disability
cases
as
well
as
death
cases.
i
am
talking
about
the
word
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
you
heard
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
isn't
it
true
that
that
is
for
a
rather
different
purpose
to
be
sure
that
the
total
compensation
package
meets
the
local
area
standard
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
the
purpose
of
the
davis-bacon
act
quite
different?
it
is
to
be
sure
that
the
compensation
paid
by
the
government
contractors
is
as
high
as
the
local
prevailing
wage
standard
and
they
include
in
that
computation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
statute
requires
that
they
pay
at
least
as
high,
wages
at
least
as
high
as
the
prevailing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--correct,
for
that
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
that
in
a
dissenting
opinion
if
i
remember
correctly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
talking
about
the
miller
act
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
wasn't
i
in
dissent
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
i...
was
i
not
in
dissent
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
i
was.
