mr.
larson,
would
you
tell
us
what
happened
to
the
legislation
that
had
been
introduced
in
the
congress,
i
guess,
to
overrule
the
decision
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
house
take
any
action
on
the
bill?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
last
year
the
house
took
no
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
assuming
you
are
correct,
what
happens
to
things
like
medical
insurance
premiums
that
might
be
paid
to
a
fund
by
the
employer
in
the
future?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
that
is
the
problem.
so,
if
you
are
right,
how
do
we
distinguish
in
the
future
between
payments
such
as
rent
and
board
and,
on
the
other
hand,
medical
insurance?
i
mean,
what
is
the
line?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
larson,
i
suppose
that
some
payments
by
an
employer
of
board
or
lodging
might
not
be
paid
directly
to
the
employee
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
certain
medical
benefits
have
a
present
cash
value
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
medical
benefits
for
the
family?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
the
question
is
whether
it
is
a
similar
advantage.
now,
how
would
you
treat
that
to
the
extent
that
it
would
go
to
the
family
for
their
medical
care?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
should
we
treat
it
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
principle
is
exactly
the
same.
i
mean,
if
we
were
to
affirm,
you
would
have
exactly
the
same
calculation
for
benefits
for
those
who
were
injured.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
i
suppose
the
question
under
the
statute...
you
are
dealing
with
a
statute...
is
whether
these
contributions
to
the
funds
constitute
a
"similar
advantage"
under
the
statutory
language.
