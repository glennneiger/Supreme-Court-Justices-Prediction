mr.
george
s.
leonard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
we
have
before
us
has
hardly
been
described
to
you.
we
are
talking
about
a
death
benefit
case.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
compensation
case.
you
have
heard
great
things
about
the
atlantic
and
gulf
contract
which,
of
course,
has
no
place
in
the
record.
you
have
heard
about
tens
of
millions
of
cases
without
one
being
named.
you
have
heard
of
tens
of
thousands
of
reopened
cases
which
are
about
to
happen
which
aren't
going
to
happen
as
far
as
we
know,
because,
after
all,
very
few
people
have
died.
vacation
pay
and
overtime
was
described
to
you
as
coming
within
the
field
of
similar
advantage
when,
in
fact,
they
are
perfectly
ordinary
pay.
they
are
the
money
rates
at
which
the
contract
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
death
takes
place.
we
have
exhibit
three
in
this
case
in
the
record.
it
is
a
contract
between
the
union
that
hilyer
belonged
to
and
the
employers
including
this
employer.
it
is,
in
fact,
three
multi-employer
trust
plans.
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
not
talking
about
some
indefinite
cloud
called
fringe
benefits.
we
are
not
talking
about
compensation
for
disability,
and
as
i
believe
one
of
the
gentlemen
before
me
argued,
we
don't
want
to
encourage
them
not
to
come
back
to
work.
but,
hilyer
isn't
about
to
come
to
work.
he
is
in
an
entirely
different
category.
if
this
court
recalls
the
rasmussen
opinion,
the
history
of
the
'72
amendments
was
gone
into
in
great
detail
to
show
that
the
death
benefit
and
compensation
were
two
entirely
different
things
in
the
mind
of
congress
at
the
time
they
passed--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--no,
they
don't
make
the
distinction
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
there
is
such
a
distinction;
namely,
it
is
a
death
benefit
under
section
9
of
the
act.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
in
one
case
the
employee
gets
it
and
in
the
other
case
the
beneficiaries
or
relics
get
it.
that,
to
me,
seems
to
be
a
significant
legal
difference
and
that
is
what
the
statute
provides.
it
may
be
that
the
fact
they
are
calculated
in
much
the
same
way
is
the
overruling
factor
but
we
must
remember,
as
in
the
potomac
case
which
was
cited
to
you,
congress
has
specifically
provided
for
the
length
of
time
that
any
disability
may
continue
and
that
isn't
the
case
in
a
death
benefit.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no.
may
i...
there
is
every
effort
on
the
petitioners'
side
to
make
it
appear
that
it
comes
under
the
similar
advantage
language.
actually
what
the
statute
says
in
plain
terms
is
that
it
is
the
money
rates
at
which
the
employment
is
compensation,
is
recompensed,
i
believe,
is
the
actual
word
used
by
the
statute.
it
is
every
form
of
recompense.
there
is
nothing
about
the
employee
having
to
receive
it.
he
has
to
receive
a
similar
advantage
from
the
employer,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
receive
the
money
rates.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
answer
is,
yes,
they
could
because,
number
one,
in
the
case
that
you
decided
in
january
of
this
year,
the
bowen
case,
you
held
that
a
negotiated
contract
such
as
this
one
was
considerably
superior
to
the
old
employment
contract.
in
effect,
what
you
were
saying
there
was
that
this
is
part
of
modern
labor
practice
and
it
is.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
is
the
bowen
case
which
you
decided
on
january
11,
i
believe.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
i
can
look--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--the
point
was...
you
pointed
out
at
that
time--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--in
alessi
and
one
other
case
you
have
already
held
that
the
union
has
an
absolute
right
as
a
trustee
to
come
into
court
and
see
to
it
that
the
employer
does
pay
into
the
fund
as
he
is
required
to
do
by
the
contract.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
i
don't
think
the
employer
is,
but
the
employee
is
because
that
is
what
congress
said.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
employee
can
come--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
yes,
i
do.
under
the
labor
management
relations
act,
the
employee
has
a
right
to
go
into
court
to
ascertained
that
the
money
is
being
put
into
the
trust
in
his
name,
the
amount
of
it,
that
is
the
value
of
it,
and
if
it
is
not
being,
to
take
such
steps
as
he
needs
to
to
see
to
it
that
the
employer
contributes.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
this
comes
back
to
a
fact--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
your
honor,
and
never
will
be.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
he
didn't
have
the
life...
i
am
sorry.
are
there
any
other
benefits
did
you
say?
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
the
time
he
took
off
for
coffee
breaks
constituted
part
of
his
wages,
but
we
have
not
sued
for
it.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
answer,
i
think,
is
probably
so.
there
are
certain
what
are
known
in
one
legislative
history
as
bona
fide
fringe
benefits
which
would
be
part
of
wages
even
if
not
in
the
particular
union
contract.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
would
depend
on
the
terms
of
erisa.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
employee
retirement--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--no.
i
believe
these
funds
are
handled
on
an
insurance
basis.
they
pay
off
the
people
for
whom
they
are
vested.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
the
insurance
benefits,
of
course,
are
applicable
immediately.
in
other
words,
every
employee
is
covered
by
the
insurance
benefit.
he
is
covered
at
all
times
by
the
training
benefit.
the
pension,
of
course,
he
does
not
vest
until
a
certain
amount
of
time.
and,
the
question,
of
course...
that
is
the
question
in
this
case.
how
do
you
value
the
future
of
a
person
who
has
been
killed?
i
don't
know.
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you,
i
can't
find
any
cases
that
are
specifically
on
it.
i
can
find
a
section
of
the
tax
statute
that
refers
to
it,
but
it
is
the
only
one
i
can
find
and
that
is
highly
indefinite
and
we
will
get
to
that
in
a
moment.
now,
what
i
wanted
to
say
is
that
the
compensation
community,
i
believe
it
was
described
by
dr.
larson,
some
800
insurance
companies,
65
employers
and
the
united
states
now
are
opposed
to
me.
and,
i
represent
only
the
claimant
in
this
case.
i
don't
represent
any
other
respondent.
but,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
entire
case
being
made
here
is
a
case
of
extraordinary,
literally
extraordinary
exaggeration
if
the
record
is,
in
fact,
the
basis
upon
which
this
case
is
to
be
determined.
i
have
already
said
there
is
no
atlantic
and
gulf
contract.
in
fact,
there
are
no
maritime
workers
in
this
case
at
all.
this
is
a
district
of
columbia
adoption
of
the
case,
not
necessarily
something
else
which
i
don't
know.
justice
stevens,
i
believe
your
question
was
directed
right
to
it;
namely,
they
put
it
in
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
compensation
and
they
take
it
out
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
fact
and
thereby
achieve
a
result.
what
is
the
actual
fact
on
the
record?
this
man
gets
68
cents
an
hour
in
these
three
benefits.
that
is
a
total
of
$27
a
week.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
is,
of
course,
this
case.
i
agree.
if
this
case
were
decided
for
the
plaintiff--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--the
widow
and
her
two
sons
as
the
court
of
appeals
put
it,
he
would
get
a
total
addition
of
$27
a
week,
68
cents
and
hour,
constituting
approximately
9
%
increase,
9-1/2
%
increase
in
his
wages.
i
simply
don't
know
on
the
basis
of
this
record
where
the
$22,000
a
year,
where
the
$24,000
a
year,
the
tens
of
millions
of
cases,
the
tens
of
thousands
of
reopened
cases,
the
nightmare
of
compensation
run
wild,
i
don't
know
where
these
come
from.
they
are
certainly
not
in
this
record.
let
me
be
perfectly
frank
about
it
because
i
have.
i
myself
now
am
going
outside
the
record.
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this.
i
don't
know
that
these
facts
are
true.
but,
according
to
the
department
of
labor,
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics,
in
their
bulletin
2140
of
1981,
they
point
out
that
two-fifths
of
all
employers
at
the
present
time
are
funding
such
benefits
as
we
are
talking
about.
they
identified
11
employer-paid
benefits,
two-fifths
of
which
are
being
paid
for
by
the
employers.
they
identified
17
employee-paid
benefits
which
i
presume
the
employees
are
paying
for.
that
is
stock
sharing.
and,
if
this
court
will
recall,
it
had
in
the
ford
case,
the
ford
decision,
the
interesting
question
of
access
to
the
company
cafeteria
which
you
held
to
be
an
actual
benefit
and
part
of
a
man's
wages.
now,
i
have
to
rescind
that.
you
didn't
say
it
was
part
of
his
wages,
but
you
said
it
was
part
of
his
recompense.
it
was
something
he
was
entitled
to
get.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
social
security
is
offset
by
the
benefits
you
receive
from
workmen's
compensation.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
i
do
not
know.
i
do
know
that
in
the
alessi
decision
of
this
court
you
held
that
pension
trust
benefits
could
be
offset
from
social
security
and
the
same
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
benefits
were
described
as
being
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
which
had
to
be
negotiated.
and,
if
you
will...
by
the
way,
the
citation
on
that
case
i
referred
to
about
the
cafeteria
prices
is
the
ford
motor
company
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
which
you
pointed
out
that
access
to
the
company
cafeteria
was
a
very
definite
benefit
and
it
is,
of
course.
whether
it
is
part
of
wages
is
an
entirely
different
story.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
if
these
are
recompense,
and
i
believe
they
are,
what
we
are
talking
about
today
is
an
entirely
different
labor
picture
than
we
had
more
than
half
a
century
ago
when
this
case...
when
this
was
first
passed.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
heard
your
question
and
your
question
is
does
it
apply
to
disability
and
i
said,
yes.
and,
what
is
the
thing
here
is
very
interesting.
you
see,
an
employee
now
can
deduct,
defer
is
the
right
word,
the
income
from
these
benefits
until
he
retires,
until
he
actually
receives
them.
in
fact,
he
never
pays
any
tax
on
the
medical
insurance
at
all.
he
never
pays
any
tax
on
the
training
if
he
doesn't
take
it.
but,
i
found
three
cases
which
have
rather
odd
benefits
which
are
not
part
of
the
contract
and,
therefore,
were
taxable.
number
one,
where
the
employee's
children
are
paid
educational
benefits
out
of
the
plan.
it
was
held
to
be
income
to
the
employee.
where
the
employee
received
strike
benefits
from
the
union
to
keep
them
from
going
back
to
work.
that
was
held
to
be
income
on
which
he
had
to
pay.
now,
the
title
26
is
very
clear
about
this.
title
26
in
effect
says
that
everything
a
person
receives
directly
or
as
a
third-party
beneficiary,
which
is
this
case,
is
income
on
which
he
must
pay
taxes.
then
congress
passed
the
multi-employer
pension
plan
amendments
act
which
added
sections
401
to
422
to
the
title
26
and
in
401
it
is
provided
that
these
payments
by
the
employer
into
pension
plan
trusts
are
not
to
be
taxed
to
the
employer
until
he
receives
them,
then
they
are
to
be
taxed
to
the
employee.
meanwhile,
the
employer,
however,
is
totally
entitled
to
deduct
as
payroll
expense
all
of
these
payments.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no.
i
have
trouble
with
the
training
fund.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
this
happens
to
be
one
case
in
which
i
going
to
join
with
the
petitioners.
they
take
everything
from
mrs.
hilyer's
point
of
view,
whereas,
in
fact,
the
statute
has
everything
from
mr.
hilyer's
point
of
view.
nevertheless,
from
her
point
of
view,
she
can't
go
back
to
work
without
some
kind
of
retraining.
so,
in
the
sense
that
he
had
it
to
improve
his
job
which
brought
money
home
to
her,
you
see,
the
equivalent
is
her
ability
to
go
out
and
earn
money
to
bring
home.
so,
i
have
to
say
with
the
petitioners
that
in
this
case
we
should
look
to
mrs.
hilyer
instead
of
mr.
hilyer,
because
his
possibility
of
getting
that
training
is
gone
forever.
her
necessity
is
still
in
existence.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
yes,
i
think
it
definitely
should
be
included
in
wages,
because
the
question
we
have
here
on
wages
is
really
a
very
simply
one.
as
long
as
employees
can
defer
taxability
and
employers
can
get
it
immediately,
there
is
going
to
be
a
strong
union
push
to
put
more
and
more
benefits
into
a
wage
package,
into
a
contract.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
already
told
you
that
the
department
of
labor
has
identified
some
28
benefits
of
which
11
are
employer
paid.
i
can
go
further
than
that.
i
found
a
conference
board
report
which
specializes
in
employee
benefits
and
they
say
that
dental
benefits,
prescription
drugs,
optical,
hearing
aid...
and
i
will
come
to
the
last
one
in
a
moment...
are
all
new
types
of
benefits
which
most
unions
today
are
seeking
to
obtain.
eight-four
percent
of
employers
today
are
paying
for
these
benefits.
now,
i
don't
think
this
is
any
indication
that
the
employer
wants
to
pay,
that
this
is
out
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart,
that
this
is
what
has
loosely
been
called
a
contribution.
it
isn't
a
contribution
at
all.
it
isn't
a
fringe
benefit.
it
isn't
anything
but
part
of
what
the
employer
is
paying
in
order
to
get
this
man
on
his
payroll.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
believe
we...
we
come...
let
me
put
that...
let
me
answer
that
this
way
if
i
may.
the
new
benefit
which
has
currently
only
been
adopted
by
20
employers
with
87
more
now
considering
it
is
called
the
cafeteria
benefit
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
ford
case
which
was
the
access
to
the
company
cafeteria.
a
cafeteria
benefit
is
where
the
employer
says
i
will
pay
$10
an
hour
for
this
man.
i
will
pay
him
$7
in
salary
and
$3
and
you
can
split
that
up
into
any
kind
of
benefit
you
want.
now,
that
is
called
a
cafeteria
benefit.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
because
the
union
asked
them
to.
and,
he
can...
since
the
employee
can
defer
it
and
it
doesn't
cost
him
any
money
one
way
or
the
other,
it
is
exactly
what
he
wants
to
do.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
it
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
to
the
union.
it
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence
to
the
employer.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
i
suppose
that
the
answer
is
that
they
probably
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
unions
are
supposed
to
represent
their
workers.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
what?
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
workers
get
tax
deferment
for
all
of
the
benefits
that
apply
to
the
wages.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
what?
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
employer
deducts
it
immediately
as
part
of
his
payroll.
that
is...
this
is
the
thing
that
we
are
going
to
see,
more
and
more
of
these
benefits.
the
take-home
pay
with
the
various
deductions
is
going
to
be
down
to
a
minimum
and
the
tax
deferral
scheme,
if
we
continue
the
way
we
are
going,
is
obviously
going
to
take
over
the
labor
market
sooner
or
later.
these
benefits
are
going
to
get
larger
and
larger.
mr.
george
s.

davis-bacon,
federal
employees,
miller
act,
national
labor
relations
act,
the
social
security
act,

and
the

mr.
george
s.
leonard
because
i
can
take
each
one
as
being
tied
in
to
workmen's
compensation
directly.
let's
take
the
davis-bacon
act.
it
wasn't
cited
to
you.
it
wasn't
quoted
to
you.
but,
what
is
says
that
on
public
buildings
labor's
wages
are
to
include
the
employer
payments
to
the
unions
and
that
is
to
be
counted
when
adjusting
the
compensation
of
the
worker.
that
is
what
it
says
in
the
davis-bacon
act.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
don't
have
quotations
marks
around
it
so
i
cannot
say
that
is
so.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
know
that...
i
am
sorry,
i--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--are
you
suggesting
that
they
would
pay
a
higher
compensation
on
the
basis
of...
for
a
laborer
on
a
public
building
than
one
on
another
building?
i
don't
believe
that
was
ever
congress's
intent.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
at
least
as
high
then
would
include
the
fringe
benefits.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
correct.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
now,
i
am
clear
that
the
employer
payments
to
unions
is
part
of
the
statutory
language.
i
am
clear
that
these
are
to
be
counted
in
and
i
quote,
"adjusting
compensation
for
injuries"
from
the
statute.
that
is
40
usc
276(a).
let's
take
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
because
this
is
a
rather
remarkable
parallel.
assuming
that
congress
doesn't
particularly
want
to
distinguish
between
the
two,
which
it
might
well
do,
we
take
section
8171
of
the
federal
employees
compensation
act...
that
is
title
5,
81...
starting
at
8114...
and
that
applies
to
non-appropriated
fund
activities.
now,
remember,
these
are
civilian
people
and
they
are
brought
under
this
act
we
are
now
talking
about,
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act.
in
other
words,
congress
is
saying
in
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
this
covers
non-appropriated
fund
activities
and
their
personnel
come
under
workers'
compensation.
let's
take
the
miller
act.
this
i
can't
go
very
far
because
of
your
statement
before,
mr.
justice
stevens,
because
these
are
sums
justly
due
the
employees,
because
that
is
exactly
what
you
said
and
there
is
no
point
in
going
into
it.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
what?
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
was
the
miller
act
case.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
it
was
what?
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
let
me
go
back
for
a
moment
to
davis-bacon
as
a
matter
of
fact.
as
part
of
the
general
exaggeration
of
these
facts,
we
have
a
very
curious
happening
in
davis-bacon.
remember,
you
were
told
that
the
amendment
to
this
act
went
back
to
1964
and
that
it
had
a
parallel
history
to
the
workmen's
compensation
act?
it
was
never
amended.
it
was
supplemented
but
never
amended.
you
see,
there
never
was
a
definition
that
kept
out
fringe
benefits
in
the
davis-bacon
act.
congress
was
intent
on
seeing
that
they
were,
in
fact,
put
in
to
the
act
and,
therefore,
supplemented
it
in
1964,
almost
20
years
ago
which
shows
that
congress
is
really
not
behind
the
times.
let
me
take
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
have
already
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
benefits
are
negotiable
and
that
leads,
of
course,
to
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
created
employee
trusts.
apparently
congress
distrusted
the
unions
on
these
funds
to
the
extent
that
it
created
the
trust
form
of
handling,
gave
the
right
to
the
union
and
to
the
individual
to
make
sure
that
the
contributions
were
put
into
it.
and,
in
section
17
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act
it
is
provided
that
whatever
you
have
received
from
one
of
the
union
benefit
plans
you
may
have
to
return
if
you
get
workmen's
compensation.
you
may
have
to
put
it
back
into
the
trust.
now,
nothing,
i
think,
could
be
clearer
than
to
show
that
what
is
paid
into
these
trusts,
if
paid
out
without
compensation,
must
be
put
back
if
you
get
compensation.
the
interrelationship
of
the
two
is
fascinating.
by
the
way,
there
is
a
typo
in
the
hilyer
brief.
it
says
it
is
section
7
when
in
fact
it
is
section
17,
but
it
has
been
identified
two
or
three
other
places
as
17.
that
is
on
page
24.
let's
come
down
to
the
social
security
act.
as
i
have
already
mentioned,
you
have
to
offset
both
disability
and
compensation
and
pension
trust
benefits
from
what
you
receive
under
medicare
and
under
erisa.
you
have
in
tax...
i
have
already
talked
about
the
fact.
i
take
it
that
this
court
is
fully
familiar
with
section
501(c)
of
the
title
26
which
in
section
5
exempts
all
labor
organizations
from
tax,
which
in
section
17
exempts
benefit
plan
trusts
such
as
these
three
from
tax.
in
section
22
also
exempts
government
retirement
funds
from
tax.
and,
congress
passed
a
law,
as
you
probably
know,
in
the
economic
recovery
tax
act
that
forbids
the
internal
revenue
service
from
issuing
any
regulations
on
how
to
tax
these
benefits
and
this
runs
through
the
end
of
1983
and
probably...
and,
since
this
is
the
third
extension,
i
am
sure
it
will
be
extended
again
or
it
is
reasonable.
thank
you
very
much.
