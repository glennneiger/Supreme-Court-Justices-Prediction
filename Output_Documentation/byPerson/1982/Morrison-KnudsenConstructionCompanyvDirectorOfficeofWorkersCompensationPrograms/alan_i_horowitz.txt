mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
discuss
what
i
believe
is
the
underlying
premise
of
the
respondent's
contention
in
this
case
and
that
is
looking
at
wages
contemporaneously
any
common
sense
notion
of
wages
must
include
the
contributions
and,
therefore,
whatever
the
intent
of
congress
was
in
1927,
the
statute
today
must
be
construed
to
cover
them.
this
premise
is
false.
in
fact,
common
sense
does
not
dictate
that
these
contributions
must
be
covered
and
that
is
particularly
true
in
the
workers'
compensation
context.
such
contributions
are
generally
not
treated
as
wages
in
other
contexts
and
they
have
never
been
so
treated
under
the
longshoremen's
act.
this
is
so,
because
the
contributions,
even
as
viewed
in
the
abstract,
are
quite
different
from
ordinary
wages.
they
are
paid
to
union
administered
funds
and
they
benefit
particular
employees
only
in
an
uncertain
and
indirect
way.
moreover
and
more
important,
in
the
specific
workers'
compensation
context,
they
are
unlike
wages
in
that
they
generally
do
not
represent
income
loss
to
the
employees'
beneficiaries
by
reason
of
his
disability
or
death
and,
therefore,
income
that
must
be
made
up
by
the
longshoremen's
benefit
in
order
to
pay
expenses
that
the
widow
will
have
to
pay
later.
i
would
like
to
speak
first
to
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier
about
whether
there
is
really
value
to
some
of
these
things
that
must
be
replaced.
one
thing
that
is
important
to
note
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
itself
never
attempted
to
value
these
benefits.
it
is
true
that
something
like
medical
insurance
does
have
a
value
to
the
worker
and
to
his
family,
but
the
court
of
appeals
never
made
any
effort
to
assess
that
value.
it
just
arbitrarily
picked
these
contributions
that
are
made
by
the
employer
to
these
funds.
these
contributions
are
not
made
to
the
benefit
of
a
particular
employee.
they
are
just
made
to
the
funds
in
general.
now,
the
fund
invests
those
contributions
in
a
way
that
does
rebound
to
the
benefits,
to
the
benefit
of
employees
as
a
whole
but
not
in
a
way
that
rebounds
the
benefit
of
a
particular
employee.
i
think
that
can
be
seen
by
looking
at
the
pension
plan
involved
here.
employees
make
contributions
or...
excuse
me,
the
employer
makes
contributions
for
every
hour
worked
by
and
employee,
but
an
employee
does
not
necessarily
receive
pension
credit
for
each
of
those
hours.
there
is
a
certain
minimum
level
he
must
reach
before
any
pension
credits
are
accrued.
he
may
receive
the
same
pension
credit
for
different
levels
of
hours
that
he
works
and
unless
he
vests,
which
in
this
case,
i
believe,
requires
ten
years
of
service,
something
mr.
hilyer
never
had,
he
does
not
ultimately
receive
any
pension.
now,
as
far
as...
in
the
specific
longshoremen's
context,
whether
it
makes
sense
to
consider
these
contributions
within
the
wage
base,
i
think
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
question
of
whether
there
is
going
to
be
a
double
recovery
by
including
these
benefits
in
the
wage
base.
the
fact
that
they
may
have
value
to
the
employee
at
the
time
he
is
working
for
the
employer
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
his
beneficiaries
need
money
to
cover
those
expenses
once
he
has
become
disabled
or
died.
i
think
it
would
be
instructive
to
look
at
each
of
the
benefits
on
their
own
in
assessing
this.
life
insurance
is
the
most
obvious
example.
it
is
true
that
mr.
hilyer
received
a
benefit
when
the
union-administered
funds
were
used
to
purchase
a
life
insurance
policy
on
his
life.
but,
now
that
he
has
passed
away,
there
is
certainly
no
need
for
his
beneficiary
here
to
receive
a
benefit
to
cover
the
expenses
of
purchasing
such
a
policy
on
her
own.
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
policy
on
mr.
hilyer's
life.
in
fact,
she
has
already
received
the
benefits
of
that
policy
which
was
paid
out
when
he
died.
the
same
is
true
of
other
types
of
benefits
that
are
purchased
by
these
employer
contributions
through
the
union-administered
funds.
disability
insurance,
unemployment
insurance,
there
is
certainly
no
need
for
mrs.
hilyer
to
go
out
and
purchase
on
here
own.
the
training
fund
that
is
specifically
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
certainly
not
for
the
benefit
of
mrs.
hilyer.
indeed,
it
seems
to
be
not
for
the
benefit
of
particular
employees
at
all.
the
same
is
true
of
pensions.
and,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
pensions
to
some
extent,
because
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
mentioned
pensions
as
something
that
mrs.
hilyer
would
have
to
go
out
and
purchase
on
her
own
later.
the
purpose
of
a
pension
fund
is
to
provide
for
the
replacement
of
income
upon
retirement.
now,
the
need
to
receive
these
pension
payments
is
triggered
by
a
specific
event,
retirement
or
the
ending
of
a
person's
employment.
that
has
already
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
hilyer
is
not
going
to
retire
in
the
future
and
the
death
benefit
that
he
received
under
the
longshoremen's
act
begins
upon
his
death
and
will
continue
up
through
the
period
that
he
would
have
been
working
and
beyond
the
period
when
he
would
have
retired.
so,
in
that
sense,
the
death
benefit
itself
is
its
own
pension.
so,
there
is
no
reason
for
mrs.
hilyer
to
go
out
now
and
invest
in
an
annuity
or
something
like
that
to
provide
a
pension.
the
longshoremen's
act
has
already
provided
that
pension
for
her.
so,
for
her
to
receive
an
additional
benefit
by
including
the
pension
contributions
in
her
wage
base
is
nothing
more
than
a
double
recovery.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
director--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
director...
well,
we
mention
that
in
our
brief.
the
director
took
a
different
litigating
position
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
i
should
say
though
that
the
administrative
practice
under
this
act
has
always
been
consistent.
it
dates
back
to
well
before
1968
when
this
memorandum
was
written.
these
contributions
have
never
been
included
in
the
wage
base
by
employers,
by
claimants,
or
by
the
agency.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
pardon
me?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the
decision
was
made
to
take
this
position
in
the
court
of
appeals.
probably
there
wasn't
adequate
consultation
at
the
time,
but
since
it
has
been
rethought--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--who
represented
the
director?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
department
of
labor,
i
believe.
i
would
like
to
speak
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
rent
payments,
which
are
specifically
authorized
by
the
statute
should
perhaps,
under
the
theory
propounded
by
petitioner,
really
ought
not
be
considered
in
the
wage
base
either
if
they
are
paid,
say,
directly
to
the
apartment
building
rather
than
the
employee.
i
think
there
is
a
big
difference
between
that
situation,
where
there
is
essentially
a
shortcut
taken
in
the
payment,
rather
than
paying
the
money
to
the
employee
who
then
passes
it
on
to
the
apartment
building,
the
money
is
paid
directly
to
the
apartment
building.
that
is
nothing
more
than
a
shortcut,
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
detour
and
a
very
long
and
uncertain
detour.
the
money
is
not
paid
directly
to
the
employee.
it
is
paid
to
these
funds.
but,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
the
funds
are
not
simply
a
channel
like
the
court
of
appeals
said,
for
the
money
to
be
passed
on
to
the
employees.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
employee
has
died
and
if
the
union
had
given
him
an
insurance
policy
to
cover
the
medical
benefits
for
his
entire
family,
that
probably
is
an
expense
that
the
beneficiaries
would
have
to
pick
up
afterwards.
in
a
disability
case
i
am
not
sure
that
would
be
so
because
these
insurance
policies
often
continue
for
disabled
employees.
i
think
my
answer
to
that
question
has
to
be
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
act
as
a
whole
and
at
these
benefits
as
a
whole.
there
is
no
way
under
the
statutory
definition
really
to
distinguish
between
life
insurance,
medical
insurance,
training
funds,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
similar
advantage
for
many
of
the
reasons
specified.
the
money
is
not
paid
directly,
the
benefits
received
by
the
employee
are
very
uncertain.
what
i
would
say
is
that
it
does
make
some
economic
sense
for
medical
insurance
benefits
to
be
included
in
the
wage
base
as
i
think
it
does
not
make
economic
sense
for
pension
and
life
insurance
benefits.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
general
rule
for
the
totality
of
cases.
and,
if
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
slight
under-recovery
by
the
claimant
because
in
some
cases
there
may
be
medical
insurance
that
she
perhaps
should
get
credit
for
or
whether
there
is
going
to
be
a
very
significant
under-recovery
because
a
lot
of
fringe
benefits
are
going
to
be
lumped
in
that
make
no
economic
sense.
i
think
the
court
has
to
follow,
i
think,
what
is
the
best
reading
of
the
statutory
definition
and
not
include
these
benefits.
now,
the
fact
that
there
is
some
need
to
pay
for
medical
insurance
may
be
something
that
congress
took
into
account
in
setting
the
percentages
of
wages
that
the
employees
are
actually
going
to
receive
for
benefits.
i
would
also
like
to
note
that
in
numerous
other
contexts--
