when
was
the
davis-bacon
act
amended
to
include--
justice
william

rehnquist
--'64?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william

rehnquist
of
course,
the
employee
in
1927
saw
a
right
with
his
monthly
paycheck
the
benefit
of
a
rent
payment
or
a
food
payment.
and,
an
employee
today
doesn't
see
on
a
monthly
basis
the
pension
payment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leonard,
i
didn't
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
to
suggest
that
it
would
treat
the
computations
differently
in
the
case
of
death
benefits
than
in
the
case
of--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leonard,
what
if
the
contract
in
this
case
had
provided,
in
addition
to
the
things
it
does
provide
for,
that
the
employer
would
contribute
five
cents
an
hour
for
each
worker
to
a
fund
to
build
a
gymnasium
for
the
workers
on
his
property?
would
you
say
that
would
be--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
case
was
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
is
the
other
party?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
don't
bother.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
a
case
involving
whether
or
not
a
union
was
liable
for
damages
resulting
from
failure
to
properly
represent.
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
workmen's
compensation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
that
to
me
does
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
an
employee
who
has
a
contract
with
the...
a
collective
bargaining
contract
with
the
employer
is
necessarily
on
the
same
footing
as
the
union
would
be.
the
union
is
a
direct
recipient
of--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
think
the
employee
could
come
into
court--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--would
you
wait
and
let
me
finish
my
question,
please?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
employee
would
have
the
same
standing
to
come
into
court
in
a
situation
such
as
that
raised
in
the
alessi
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
he
gets
them.
he
doesn't
really
get
them,
does
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
his
widow.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
leonard,
is
that
true
of
the
training
fund
too?
if
an
employee--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
would
think
if
an
employee
gets
restraining
he
doesn't
then
realize
income,
does
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
don't
think
the
training
fund
payment
should
be
included
in
the
wage?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
these
are
more
attractive
to
the
employer
than
straight
wage
raises
because
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
pay
tax?
does
he
have
to
pay
taxes
on
money
that
he
puts
into
a
pension
fund
or
medical
fund
or
training
fund,
the
employer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
more
attractive
to
the
employer
than
paying
$10
in
wages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
matter
of
no
consequence--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
if
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
the
union,
why
do
they
ask
for
it?
why
do
they
prefer
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
suggesting
that
the
workers
want
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
suggesting
that
really
the
workers
prefer
the
7-3
cafeteria--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
congress
recognized
that
in
the
case
of
the
davis-bacon
act
and
amended
the
statute
accordingly.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
recite
all
those
seriatim?
