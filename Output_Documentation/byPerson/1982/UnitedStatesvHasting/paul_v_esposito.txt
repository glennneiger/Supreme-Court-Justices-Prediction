mr.
paul
v.
esposito
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
the
remedial
powers
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals.
like
chapman,
it
involves
comments
on
the
failure
to
testify,
and
like
chapman,
for
purposes
of
review,
the
error
was
conceded,
but
there
are
significant
differences.
in
chapman,
at
the
time
the
comment
was
made,
the
courts
had
not
yet
found
that
that
type
of
comment,
at
least
in
the
state
court
setting,
was
constitutional
error.
however,
in
this
case,
long
before
the
comment
had
been
made,
the
courts
of
appeals
had
found
that
this
type
of
comment
was
in
fact
constitutional
error.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
yes.
we
are
not
trying
to...
we
are
not
here
today,
your
honor,
asking
this
court
to
overrule
chapman
in
any
regard.
we
find...
we
feel
that
this
case
presents
a
significant...
this
case
is
significantly
different
from
chapman.
chapman
involved
the
question,
of
course,
of
whether
a
fifth
amendment
comment
could
ever
be
harmless
error,
and
the
court
said
it
did.
this
case
questions...
this
case
questions
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals,
whether
they
have
the
power
to
refrain
from
applying
chapman
in
an
appropriate
case
in
order
to
deter
misconduct
which
stands
in
violation
of
repeated
decisions
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
recognize
that
last
point.
the
federal
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
has
repeatedly
dealt
with
this
problem,
the
exact
problem,
indirect
comments
that
a
defendant
didn't
contradict
or
deny
or
refute
evidence,
and
it
has
repeatedly
held
the
same
thing.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
respondents
contend
that
it
would
be
pursuant--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--they
did
not
discuss
supervisory
power,
your
honor.
respondents
would
contend
that
that
power...
the
existence
of
that
power
would
support
their
judgment,
and
therefore
it
may
be
a
ground
for
affirmance
of
the
decision,
even
though
the
court
didn't
discuss
it.
what
happened
here,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
that
it
does
not
foreclose
it.
first
of
all,
in
bruno,
the
court
indicated
that
the
harmless
error
statute
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
commands
of
congress
and
respondents
contend
that
it
very
logically
and
easily
flows
that
it
would
not
respond
to...
would
not
apply
to
constitutional
violations
either.
let
me
make
a
point
about
the
legislative
history,
since
the
court
directed
some
questions
to
it.
the
statute
was
repealed
in
1947,
i
believe.
it
was
repealed
because
of
the
enactment
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
following
year,
in
'48,
it
was
realized
that
the
federal
rules
did
not
apply
to
the
courts
of
appeals
in
the
supreme
court,
so
it
was
in
fact
re-enacted.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
i
am
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
i
know
when
it
was
repealed.
i
am
not
quite
clear
why
it--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--there
was
a...
federal...
civil
and
criminal
procedure,
your
honor.
i
should
be
saying
the
criminal
rules
here.
so
it
was
re-enacted,
and
re-enacted
to
bring
back
the
provision,
albeit
with
the
language
change,
but
it
was
re-enacted
to
bring
back
the
provision
of
391,
which
was
basically
discussed
in
the
bruno
case,
back
into
the
federal
law.
so,
there
really
is,
from
respondent's
view,
and
what
we
see
of
the
legislative
history,
no
change
in
the
legislative
intent.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
your
honor,
we
believe
that
if
the
court...
excuse
me,
if
the
congress
had
intended
to
change
it,
there
would
have
been
much
more
discussion.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
because
the
commands
of
this
court
or
the
reading
of
this
court
was
so...
was
so
very
clear.
in
the
language
of
the
legislative
report...
in
the
bill
that
was
enacted,
in
the
bill
in
which
it
was
re-enacted,
all
that
bill
was
doing
was
to
make
typographical
change,
delete
sections
that
should
have
been
deleted
before,
add
sections
that
shouldn't
have
been
deleted.
it
was
mainly
a...
how
do
i
say
it?
a
bill
just
to
make
the
minor
changes.
there
wasn't
any
substantive
law
change
that
was
intended
by
the
bill.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
well,
the
closest
i
can
find,
your
honor,
is
the
house
report
on
the
bill,
which
just
very
briefly
talked
about
it,
and
again,
i
would
contend
that
that
indicates
that
congress
was
not
intending
a
substantive
change
that
may
change
the
prior
readings,
prior
readings
of
the
court,
and
there
is
some
language,
very
briefly,
by
senator
o'connor
the
senator
from
maryland,
i
believe,
who
also
indicated
that
this
bill
doesn't
really
mean
to...
wasn't
meant
to
make
a
great
substantive
impact
in
the
law.
so,
we
contend
that
there
is
still...
there
is
still...
the
statute
is
inapplicable,
and
furthermore,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history,
in
fact,
nothing
in
chapman
itself
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
harmless
error
rule
itself
was
meant
to
take
away
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
court
to
deter
repeated
misconduct.
that
is
a
point
i
think
that
has
to
be
brought
out
in
this
case.
the
seventh
circuit
has
addressed
this
problem
in
the
past.
they
have
told
the
prosecutors
that
these
types
of
comments
are
wrong.
they
have
threatened
summary
reversals,
and
in
fact,
to
make
their
point
perfectly
clear,
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
circulate
an
unpublished
opinion
to
all
the
united
states
attorneys
within
the
circuit
with
instructions
to
either
give
a
copy
of
that
opinion
to
the
assistant
attorneys
or
to
issue
an
explanatory
memorandum.
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
opinion
is
so
short
is
because
the
court
was
just
so
terribly
frustrated
with
what
was
going
on.
it
had
said
enough,
when
you
look
back
at
the
decisions
in--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
that's
correct.
i
think...
as
i
say,
i
think
they
just
felt
enough
was
enough,
and
they
just
decided
to
put
the
foot
down
right
here
and
now,
and
it
was
this
case
that
they
did.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
closely,
your
honor,
in
that...
in
the
type
of
comment
that
was
involved.
in
the
comments...
in
the
cases
that
are
referred
to
in
our
brief,
the
comments
were
either
that
the
defendant
had
not
denied
evidence,
had
not
refuted
evidence,
had
not
contradicted
evidence.
in
this
case,
the
contention
was
that
the
defendants
had
not
challenged
evidence,
a
different
word,
but
the
same
intent.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
different
cases.
some
involved
robberies.
i
think
there
was
a
mail
forgery,
one
case.
the
basic
facts,
the
substantive
crimes
were
different,
but
the
language
was
the
same,
and
the
standard
was
the
same.
there
was--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--because
they
were
tired
of
giving
warnings,
your
honor,
and
they
felt,
we
believe,
from
the
history
of
this
problem,
that
warnings
were
no
longer
going
to
do
the
job.
it
was
becoming
increasingly
clear
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
they
had
again
applied
chapman,
it
wouldn't
do
any
good.
what
they
were
trying
to
do
is
eliminate
the
problem.
after
speaking
to
the
problem
a
number
of
times,
after
warning
prosecutors,
the
problem
wasn't
being
eliminated,
and
that
is
what
those--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--as
opposed
to
the
others,
their
conviction
is
reversed.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
was
trying
to
clear
up
a
problem
that
won't...
or
hopefully
will
not
reoccur
in
the
future.
they...
in
a
sense,
they
do
get
a
benefit,
but
so
does
the
system,
and
i
think
that
is
what
the...
that's
what
the
court
was
interested
in,
protecting...
protecting
the
system
of
justice
so
that
these
types
of
comments
would
not
occur
in
the
future.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
your
honor,
it
may
very
well
have
been
appropriate
for
the
court
to
state
the
basis
on
which
it
was
acting
for
the
benefits
of
this
court
and
for
people
who
have
to
read
the
decisions.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
i
think--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--there
are
two
parts
to
this
opinion,
your
honor.
the
first
part,
the
part
that
is
up
for
review
today,
is
a
published
opinion.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
yes.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
the
second...
the
second
part
is
an
unpublished
order.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
the
unpublished
sections
are
not
before
the
court.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
this
part
is
published,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
your
honor,
in
the
last
decision,
united
states
versus
rodriguez,
the
decision
that
immediately
preceded
this
case,
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
this
matter
may
be
something
that
should
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
attorney
general
himself,
the
matter
of
his
repeated
comments.
the
court
did
not
bring
this
matter,
as
far
as
i
determined
from
the
decision,
the
court
did
not
bring
the
matter
up
to
the
attorney
general,
and
i
can
only
conclude
that
they
had
reassessed
the
matter
and
said
that
it
would
be
best
to
handle
this
through
a
reversal.
i
think
there
is
one...
well,
there
are
two
problems
possibly
in
terms
of
discipline.
one
is
is
a
possible
separation
of
powers
problem.
what
type
of...
in
terms
of
the
types
of
discipline
that
the
court
may
be
able
to
invoke
against
a
prosecutor.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
disciplined
by
the
district
court,
your
honor?
or
by
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
either.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
they
thought
the
comment
was
proper
in
the
first
place.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
the
court
may
have
been
able
to
issue
an
order,
a
rule
to
show
cause,
as
you
suggest.
the
problem--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--no,
i
think--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--i
have
never...
i
have
never
seen
the
power
exercised,
but
i
would
like
to
address
your
point,
your
honor.
the
problem
that
respondents
see
from
the
mere
approach
of
discipline
is
that
while
it
very
well
may
deter
this
prosecutor,
and
in
fact
it
may
deter
other
prosecutors,
it
doesn't
really
get
the
point
home
to
the
prosecutorial
system
as
to
what
this
problem
is.
it
doesn't
necessarily
get
them
to
change
their
practices,
to
change
the
educational
practices,
the
training
practices
of
prosecutors
before
they
get
to
the
trial.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
part
of
the
business
is
the
education
of
prosecutors,
and
that
is
part
of
the
basis
for
the
harmless
error
rule
itself.
certainly
the
harmless
error
rule
is
designed
in
the
first
instance
to
affirm
a
conviction,
to
affirm
the
result
when
the
result
did
not
prejudice
the
defendant,
but
the
rule
goes
farther.
it
tells
a
prosecutor,
it
tells
the
government
itself
that
conduct
that
was
committed
at
trial
was
wrong,
it
was
improper,
and
hopefully
through
the
force
of
that
decision
itself
it
coerces
a
prosecutor
not
to
repeat
those
comments
in
the
future.
that
is
where
the
education
comes
in,
through
the
proper
use
of
the
rule.
i
think
what
is
happening
in
the
seventh
circuit,
and
i
believe
what
the
seventh
circuit
is
despairing
of
through
a
reading
of
all
these
opinions
is
the
fact
that
in
a
sense
that
harmless
error,
the
rationale
is
being
broken.
rather
than
using
the
harmless
error
rule
to
affirm
the
result,
it
is
being
used
to
justify
the
conduct.
people
are
forgetting
that
there
is
error
and
just--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--because
it
is
still,
your
honor,
a
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
and
it
still
has
an
effect
on
the
system
itself.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
it
affects
the
system
in
the
way
a
prosecutor...
a
trial
is
conducted.
our
system
requires
certain
norms
of
conduct
within
it.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
just
because,
your
honor,
of
the
basic
manner
in
which
the
prosecution
is
being
gathered,
in
which
the
system
is
being
gathered.
i
guess
you
can
say
the
same
thing,
your
honor,
of
a
coerced
confession
or
any
other
type
of
constitutional
problem.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
it
may
be.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
the
seventh
circuit
has
dealt
with
this
particular
issue
in
eight
cases,
and
they
have
come
throughout
different
districts
in
the
circuit.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
the
court
wasn't...
the
problem
has
appeared
in
other
circuits.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
first
circuit,
eleven
years
ago,
the
first
circuit
adopted
a
rule
under
its
supervisory
powers
to
provide
for
reversals
for
comments
on
the...
indirect
comments
like
this
comment
on
the
failure
to
testify
where
certain
preconditions
aren't
established.
the
court
of
appeals
had
threatened
to
employ
that
rule
in
the
seventh
circuit,
but
didn't
go
so
far
as
to
do
it.
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
standards
that
can
be
applied.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
something
that
has
to
be
an
unlimited
review.
it
is
something
that
the
seventh
circuit
can
use
to
reach
a
result
whenever
it
wants.
supervisory
powers,
of
course,
are
to
be
reluctantly
exercised.
i
think
that
is
clear
from
this
court's
case
law.
but
it
is
a
discretionary
power,
too,
and
where...
and
in
determining
whether
to
exercise
the
discretion
in
cases
of
this
type,
in
the
case
of
this
type
is
repeated
misconduct
which
the
prosecutor's
failure
to
conform
to
decisions,
the
court
should
look
first
of
all
to
the
type
of
error
involved,
dealing
with
constitutional
error,
command
of
congress.
it
should
look
to
whether
they
have
addressed,
that
particular
court
has
addressed
the
problem
in
the
past,
whether
it
has
set
forth
a
clear
legal
principle,
whether
it
is
a
principle
that
can
be
applied
broadly
to
many
types
of
cases
such
as
this
type
of
case,
and
whether
that
principle
has
been
disseminated
in
sufficient
time
to
give
prosecutors
the
practical
means
of
incorporating
the
principle
into
the
methods
of
prosecution.
any
of
these
factors
are
met,
and
they
are
certainly
met
in
this
case,
the
number
of
times
that
the
court
has...
has
to
deal
with
the
problem
in
a
sense
becomes
an
aggravating
factor,
making
the
exercise
even
more
appropriate.
if
the
court
didn't
abuse
its
discretion
in
this
regard,
the
decision
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
i
argue
first
of
all,
your
honor,
that
the
statute
is
inapplicable.
secondly--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--the
statute,
because
it
wasn't,
as
i
read
the
case
law,
bruno,
and
extend
the
case
law,
your
honor,
it
wasn't
designed
to
apply...
the
case
cited
wasn't
designed
to
apply
to
violations
of
statutes.
in
fact,
in
bruno,
the
statute
involved
was
the
present
day
304.81,
commenting
on
the
failure
to
testify.
it
seems
to
me
it
very
logically
follows
that
if
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
statutes
it
wasn't
meant
to
apply
to
the
constitutional
violation.
even
assuming,
your
honor,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
statute
could
be
applied,
may
be
applicable,
we
contend
that
the
harmless
error
statute
was
not
intended
to
deprive
the
court
of
their
traditional
supervisory
powers,
powers
that
are
recognized
in
mcnabb,
powers
that
are
recognized
in
donnelly
versus
dechristoforo,
for
instance,
to
deter
prosecutorial
misconduct.
those
powers,
we
believe,
are
still
there,
and
absent
something
much
clearer
that
would
indicate
that
the
congress
meant
to
take
away
that
power,
that
supervisory
power
is
there.
in
sum,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
above
all,
the
supervisory
powers
are
the
powers
of
flexibility.
they
enable
the
courts
to
determine
whether
a
rigid
application
to
a
particular
legal
principle
is
really
going
to
frustrate
rather
than
promote
the
interests
of
justice,
and
when
it
does,
it
allows
the
courts
to
bend
slightly
the
system
to
really
meet
and
to
effectuate
in
a
good
sense
the
overall
administration
of
justice.
we
believe
that
is
what
the
court
did
here.
they
weren't
trying
to
overrule
chapman.
they
did
not
create
a
per
se
rule
in
the
seventh
circuit.
they
were
just
trying
to
say,
in
this
case,
we
will
put
our
foot
down
here.
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
in
going
back
to
those
cases,
you
will
not
see
the
words
"supervisory
power"
invoked
except
to
the
extent
that
the
court
discusses
flannery,
which,
in
that
case
the
first
circuit
invoked
their
supervisory
powers.
so
that
is
correct.
if
the
court
wants
specific
findings
as
to
the
power
basis,
it
may
very
well
have
to
remand
the
case
or
at
least
read
the
decision.
when
the
court
reaches
its
decision,
you
can--
mr.
paul
v.
esposito
--that
may
be
appropriate,
if
the
court
does
not
feel
that
a
decision
just
on
the...
does
not
feel
that
it
cannot
just
act
on
the
basis
of
supervisory
powers.
it
is
something
that
would
be
used
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
affirm.
