mr.
john
f.
depue
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
depue
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
a
federal
appellate
court
may
summarily
reverse
a
conviction
because
of
the
prosecutor's
improper
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
present
evidence,
without
first
making
an
assessment
for
prejudice
under
the
constitutional
harmless
error
standard.
briefly
summarized,
the
government's
evidence
showed
that
during
the
early
morning
of
october
11th,
1979,
three
teenaged
girls
and
a
male
companion
were
driving
in
the
vicinity
of
east
st.
louis,
illinois,
when
their
car
was
forced
off
the
road
by
five
men
driving
a
turquoise
cadillac.
after
both
cars
had
come
to
a
halt,
the
girls
were
pulled
from
their
car.
one
of
them
was
raped.
the
men
then
forced
them
into
the
cadillac,
drove
them
across
the
interstate
boundary
into
st.
louis,
missouri,
where
they
repeated
their
sexual
assaults
at
three
different
locations.
following
the
girls'
release,
one
of
them
led
the
police
to
the
apartment
where
she
had
been
taken
by
her
abductors.
there,
the
officers
arrested
respondent
stewart
and
found
items
of
clothing
belonging
to
the
victims.
they
also
located
the
turquoise
cadillac,
learned
that
it
was
registered
to
respondent
williams,
and
found
williams'
latent
prints
on
the
car
from
which
the
girls
had
been
taken.
these
developments
also
resulted
in
the
apprehension
of
the
remaining
respondents,
each
of
whom
was
identified
by
at
least
one
of
the
victims
during
a
lineup
the
following
morning.
at
their
ensuing
trial
for
rape
and
a
mann
act
violation,
each
of
the
victims
again
identified
each
respondent
as
a
participant
in
the
abductions.
the
defense
did
not
put
on
the
defendants
themselves
as
witnesses.
instead,
their
defense
was
calculated
to
discredit
the
girls,
their
credibility
and
the
accuracy
of
their
identifications
by
reference
to
the
girls'
activities
just
before
and
just
after
the
abductions
took
place.
for
example,
they
elicited
testimony
from
the
girls
during
cross
examination
that
they
had
been
out
drinking,
in
violation
of
parentally-imposed
curfews
and
that
they'd
gotten
lost
on
the
way
home
from
a
tavern.
and
that
just
after
the
abductions,
their
initial
identifications
and
descriptions
of
respondents
were
not
very
accurate
and
were
confused.
mr.
john
f.
depue
it
bears,
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
argument
that
we
will
see
that
the
prosecutor
presented
subsequently,
because
we
maintain
it
was
a
direct
reference
to
what
the
defendants
were
actually
doing.
in
addition,
respondents
presented
witnesses
of
their
own
who
testified
that
just
before
and
just
after
the
alleged
abductions,
the
physical
appearances
of
respondents
were
not
at
all
correspondent
with
those
as
described
by
the
victims.
the
prosecutor
in
his
summation
first
discussed
the
posture
of
the
government's
case.
he
then
turned
to
respondents'
case
and
he
made
the
following
statement,
which
appears
at
page
21
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
i'm
going
to
quote
it
verbatim
from
the
record
because
of
its
centrality
to
these
proceedings.
he
said,
"let's
look
at
the
evidence
the
defendant
put
on
here
for
you
so
that
we
can
put
that
in
perspective.
"
"i'm
going
to
tell
you
what
the
defendant
did
not
do.
"
"defendants
on
cross
examination
and--
"
when
respondents
objected
on
the
ground
that
they
didn't
have
to
testify
at
all,
the
prosecutor
continued,
"that's
right,
they
don't.
"
"they
don't
have
to.
"
"but
if
they
do
put
on
a
case,
the
government
can
comment
on
it.
"
"the
defendants
at
no
time
ever
challenged
any
of
the
rapes,
whether
or
not
that
occurred,
any
of
the
sodomies.
"
"they
didn't
challenge
the
kidnapping,
the
fact
that
the
girls
were
in
east
st.
louis
and
were
taken
across
to
st.
louis.
"
"they
never
challenged
the
transportation
of
the
victims
from
east
st.
louis,
illinois
to
st.
louis,
missouri,
and
they
never
challenged
the
location
or
whereabouts
of
the
defendants
at
all
relevant
times.
"
"they
want
you
to
focus
your
attention
on
all
the
events
that
were
before
all
of
the
crucial
events
of
that
evening.
"
"they
want
to
pull
your
focus
away
from
the
beginning
of
the
incident
in
east
st.
louis
after
they
were
bumped,
and
then
the
proceeding
events.
"
"they
want
to
focus
to
the
events
prior
to
that.
"
following
this,
the
defense
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
fifth
amendment
grounds.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
motion,
commenting
that
to
his
view,
this
was
simply
a
commentary
of
the
posture
of
the
cases
and
didn't
implicate
fifth
amendment
issues
at
all.
the
seventh
circuit,
however,
disagreed,
characterizing
the
remarks
as
a
pointed
allusion
to
respondents'
failure
to
take
the
stand,
and
held
that
they
constituted
a
clear
violation
of
this
court's
decision
in
griffin
versus
california.
although
the
court
acknowledged
that
the
crimes
were
heinous
and
that
the
evidence
of
guilt
was
clear,
it
refused
to
assess
for
prejudice
under
the
constitutional
harmless
error
standard.
instead,
after
alluding
to
the
fact
that
prosecutors
in
the
seventh
circuit
had
continuously
disregarded
admonitions
not
to
make
arguments
that
implicated
fifth
amendment
rights,
they
stated
that
to
their
view,
application
of
the
constitutional
harmless
error
standard
would
impermissibly
compromise
the
defendants'
fifth
amendment
rights.
it's
the
government's
position
that
this
reasoning
is
in
direct
violation
of
this
court's
decision
in
chapman
versus
california,
violates
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
and
contravenes
broader
rules
regarding
the
formulation
of
remedies
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
john
f.
depue
justice
rehnquist,
we
didn't
seek
to
address...
we
didn't
feel
we
needed
to
address
that
in
our
brief,
although
we
do
not
concede
that
it
was,
in
fact,
a
violation
of
griffin.
we
didn't
feel
that
that
was
a
cert
worthy
issue,
and
therefore,
we
didn't
raise
it.
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
justice
o'connor,
you
certainly
do.
now,--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--no,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
justice
stevens,
we
assume
that
it
is.
we,
however,
do
not
concede
that
it
is.
mr.
john
f.
depue
oh,
certainly,
chief
justice
burger.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
presented
witnesses
of
their
own
who
said
that
they
saw
these
people
shortly
after
midnight
and
approximately
at
6:00
o'clock
in
the
morning.
and
in
addition
to
this,
one
of
respondents'
mothers,
respondent
stevens'
mother
actually
saw
stevens
and
the
girls
and
testified
that
to
her
observation,
everything
that
was
going
on
was
consensual.
so
in
fact,
these
were
challenged
to
a
certain
extent,
and
there
were
people
who
could
have
testified
to
the
contrary.
now,
of
course,
in
chapman
versus
california,
a
state
prosecutor,
relying
on
a
provision
of
the
state
constitution,
directly
and
repeatedly
commented
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
and
the
inferences
of
guilt
that
could
be
extracted
from
that.
the
trial
judge
followed
suit
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury.
following
that
trial,
however,
this
court
in
griffin
versus
california
held
that
the
provision
of
the
california
constitution
upon
which
he
had
relied
was
unconstitutional.
when
chapman's
own
case
came
before
this
court,
chapman
held,
argued
that
all
errors
of
a
constitutional
magnitude,
and
griffin
errors
in
particular,
should
be
deemed
reversal
per
se,
and
thus
not
subject
to
review
under
the
harmless
error
standard.
this
court,
however,
squarely
rejected
that
proposition.
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
f.
depue
now,
when
the
case
came
before
this
court,
the
court
rejected
that
argument,
and
held
that
griffin
violations,
just
like
any
other
non-constitutional
violations,
could
be
deemed
harmless
and
thus
not
a
basis
for
reversal.
it
reversed
chapman's
conviction,
but
only
after
first
satisfying
itself
that
given
the
less
than
overwhelming
posture
of
the
evidence,
it
could
not
be
satisfied
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
prosecutor's
pointed
and
repeated
allusions
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
was
not
harmless.
in
the
wake
of
chapman,
and
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
virtually
without
exception
held
that
the
constitutional
harmless
error
standard
applies
to
violations
of
griffin.
they
have
therefore
reversed
convictions
only
when
after
canvassing
the
evidence
in
its
totality,
looking
at
the
argument
in
its
proper
context,
they
couldn't
be
satisfied
that
it
didn't
contribute
to
the
conviction.
this
approach,
we
maintain,
is
not
only
mandated
by
the
chapman
decision
itself,
but
by
broader
principles
of
revenue
recently
articulated
by
this
court.
in
united
states
versus
morrison,
the
third
circuit
dismissed
an
indictment
because
a
government
agent
had
made
improper
remarks
to
the
defense
counsel
about
the
competency
of
her
own
lawyer,
to
the
defendant
about
the
competency
of
her
own
lawyer.
this
court,
however,
reversed,
finding
that
dismissal
was
unwarranted
absent
any
evidence
that
the
alleged
sixth
amendment
violation
could
have
prejudiced
the
defendant
and
the
proceedings
in
any
way.
in
doing
so,
the
court
admonished
the
courts
of
appeals
that
after
identifying
a
constitutional
error,
the
proper
approach
was
to
assess
the
damage,
and
to
tailor
a
remedy
that
was
commensurate
to
the
injury
received
as
a
result
of
that
violation,
and
then
a
broader
approach
would
impermissibly
infringe
upon
other
legitimate
interests.
in
the
context
of
a
chapman
violation...
of
a
griffin
violation,
this
means
that
once
the
court
has
determined
that
the
violation
occurred,
it
has
got
to
look
at
the
amount
of
prejudice
that
resulted
in
determining
whether
other
events
at
trial
offset
it.
it
cannot
summarily
reverse.
of
course,
harmless
error
principles
are
not
simply
a
matter
of
judicial
self-restraint.
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
and
rule
52(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
both
expressly
prohibit
a
court
of
appeals
from
reversing
a
conviction
on
the
basis
of
errors
or
defects
that
do
not
substantially
affect
the
nature
of
the
proceedings.
respondent
argues,
however,
that
the
harmless
error
statute
and
rule
52(a)
are
inapplicable
to
this
case
because
the
error
involved
is
of
a
constitutional
magnitude.
this
court
has,
however,
squarely
rejected
this
reasoning
in
chapman
itself.
there,
the
court
accepted
the
policy
embodied
by
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
which
was
to
require
an
assessment
of
prejudice
in
all
cases
without
regard
to
whether
the
error
was
of
a
constitutional
or
non-constitutional
magnitude.
respondent's
principal
contention,
however,
is
that
the
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
was
free
to
disregard
the
chapman
standard
and
fashion
a
remedy
of
its
own
as
a
prophylactic
measure
because
of
the
alleged
repeated
violations
of
the
griffin
standard
within
the
circuit.
in
the
first
place,
nothing
in
the
decision
of
that
court
even
suggests
that
it
was
in
fact
relying
on
its
supervisory
power.
the
court's
language
that
it
felt
the
application
of
a
harmless
error
standard
would
impermissibly
compromise
the
defendant's
fifth
amendment
rights
suggests
that
it
simply
didn't
believe
that
the
harmless
error
standard
was
sufficient,
a
sufficient
mechanism
to
protect
the
defendants
against
fifth
amendment
violations.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
seventh
circuit
could
not
adopt
a
reversal
per
se
rule
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power.
in
the
first
place,
as
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
sherman
versus
united
states
long
ago,
the
supervisory
power
entails
the
formulation
of
standards
for
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
when
congress
has
not
specifically
legislated
to
that
end.
where,
however,
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
constitutional
power
to
regulate
the
courts
has
expressly
articulated
a
standard
that
is
applicable
to
the
issue,
here,
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
and
rule
52(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
the
courts
of
appeals
are
not
free
to
disregard
that
standard
and
fashion
a
remedy
of
their
own
in
the
exercise
of
their
supervisory
power.
mr.
john
f.
depue
pardon,
justice--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--this
court
can't
do
so
either,
justice
brennan,
because
the
federal
harmless--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--no,
your
honor,
but
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
says
that.
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
justice
o'connor.
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
first,
and
most
importantly,
the
version
of
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
upon
which
justice
frankfurter
relied
in
bruno
was
amended
in
1948.
the
language
upon
which
justice
frankfurter
relied
was
deleted.
that
is
the
word
"technical",
the
phrase
"technical
errors".
as
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
broulette,
and
as
i
believe
is
one
of
the
principal
cannons
of
construction,
that
where
a
court
deletes
critical
language,
the
presumption
is,
it
intends
to
change
the
standard.
second,
in
chapman
versus
california,
of
course,
this
court
expressly
held
that
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
applies
to
errors
of
a
constitutional
magnitude.
therefore,
bruno
has
no--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--no,
your
honor,
it
wasn't.
that
was
a
state
case.
mr.
john
f.
depue
no,
it
wasn't,
justice--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--no,
i
certainly
don't,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
f.
depue
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
degree
of
certitude
between
the
constitutional
harmless
error
standard
and
the
standard
for
non-constitutional
errors
is
different.
mr.
john
f.
depue
i
suggest,
justice
stevens,
that
there
may
be
some
instances,
indeed
many
instances,
where
indirect
allusions
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand
may
be
deemed
harmless,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
depue
no,
it
wouldn't.
mr.
john
f.
depue
well,
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
as
i
said
before,
that
it
depends
upon
the
context
of
the...
that
it
depends
on
the
context
of
the
situation.
that
you
simply...
you
simply
cannot
say
that--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--it
always
affects
the
constitutional
right.
mr.
john
f.
depue
of
course,
the
statute...
the
statute
applies,
but
the
statute
simply
says,
you've
still
got
to
assess
the
presence.
the
standard
is
simply
different.
second,
even
where--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--there
may
be
some
cases
of
that
nature,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
don't
think
this
is
one
of
them,
but
there
certainly
may,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
the
constitutional
harmless
error
statute
of
fahy
versus
connecticut.
now,
even--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--absolutely
not,
because
that
would
pervade
the
entire
nature
of
the
proceedings.
that
sort
of
thing
is
not
subject
to
any
kind
of
an
accurate
assessment,
but
this,
we
believe,
is,
because
the
court
can
look
at
that...
look
at
that
remark,
look
at
how
pervasive
and
how
direct
it
is,
look
at
the
evidence,
look
at
the
judge's
instruction,
and
all
sorts
of
other
things,
and
determine
whether
there
was
adequate
damage
control
done
to
deem
that
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
even
where
it
is
otherwise
permissible
to
employ
the
supervisory
power
for
didactic
or
prophylactic
purposes
over
agents
of
the
executive
branch,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
such
authority
should
be
exercised
sparingly,
and
only
in
the
face
of
intentional
transgressions
of
legal
norms.
in
this
regard,
we
believe
that
this
particular
case
is
a
most
inappropriate
vehicle
for
exercising
such
authority.
any
didactic
benefits
that
arguably
might
result
from
a
reversal
here
will
surely
be
outweighed
by
the
cost
to
the
victims
who
must
again
relive
their
harrowing
ordeal
at
respondent's
hands.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
the
universally
accepted
test
for
determining
whether
a
griffin
violation
has
occurred
embraces
both
intentional
and
unintended
reference
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
remarks,
although
not
intended
as
comments,
are
later
subject
to
a
construction,
a
reasonable
construction
that
the
jury
could
reasonably
infer
that
they
are
related
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
it
is
a
rare
case
indeed
that
a
prosecutor
in
the
wake
of
griffin
and
chapman
sets
out
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify.
most
reversals
for
chapman
and
griffin
violations
occur
where
an
appellate
court
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
and
after
looking
at
the
totality
of
the
evidence,
the
posture
of
the
defense
case,
the
defense
theory,
the
totality
of
the
prosecutor's
remarks,
concludes
that
the
prosecutor
overstepped
an
indistinct
line
between
perfectly
permissible
commentary
upon
the
posture
of
the
defense
case
and
impermissible
reference
to
the
defendant's
personal
failure
to
rebut
damaging
evidence.
it
is
not
surprising,
given
the
highly
subjective
nature
of
this
assessment,
that
appellate
courts
will
frequently
reach
different
conclusions
on
very
similar
factual
situations
and
arguments.
i
believe
that
this
case
is
a
perfectly
good
example
of
that.
the
court
of
appeals
found
a
clear
griffin
violation
here.
the
linchpin
of
respondent's
argument
is
that
this
was
intentional
misconduct
by
the
prosecutor,
yet
the
trial
judge,
who
was
able
to
listen
to
this
evidence,
who
saw
it
come
in,
to
listened
to
the
argument,
found
that
there
wasn't
a
griffin
violation
at
all,
that
what
the
prosecutor
was
doing
was
simply
commenting
upon
the
strengths
and
the
weaknesses
of
the
case.
indeed,
while
it
is
true
that
the
prosecutor
did
use
the
word
"defendant",
no
objective
person
could
have
viewed
his
argument
as
a
commentary
upon
the
defendant's
personal
failure
to
testify.
rather,
it
is
perfectly
obvious
from
the
context
of
the
prosecutor's
remarks
here
that
they
were
intended
as
a
commentary
upon
what
the
defendant's
lawyers
were
doing.
he
used
the
word
"defendant"
just
as
i
am
using
the
word
"respondents"
today.
mr.
john
f.
depue
i
don't
think
that
you
would
have
this
type
of
violation
where
the
defendant
testified,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
type
of
argument
arises
in
the
context
where
you
have
a
non-testifying
defendant,
the
defense
puts
on
a
case,
and
the
prosecutor
during
his
closing
argument
says,
points
out
to
the
weaknesses
in
the
defense
case,
which
is,
of
course,
one
of
the
mainstays
of
proper
argument.
the
question
arises
when
he
does
that,
pointing
out
to
the
weaknesses
of
the
defense
case,
whether
he
transgresses
what
i
call
a
very
indistinct
line
between
talking
about
weaknesses
and
talking
about
the
defendants
themselves,
and
this
is
precisely
why
i
maintain
that
most
of
these
so-called
griffin
violations
are
totally
unintentional,
because
most
arise
in
the
context
of
talking
about
the
posture
of
the
evidence,
and
this
is
precisely
what
the
prosecutor
was
doing
in
this
particular
case.
he
was
talking
about
the
scope
of
cross
examination,
that
respondents
during
cross
examination
peripherally
examined
the
victims,
talked
about
their
misconduct
before,
talked
about
the
lack
of
certitude
of
their
identifications
afterward,
but
left
totally
unscathed
their
rendition
of
the
critical
events.
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
your
honor,
1948,
i
believe.
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
precursor
to
that
was
rescinded
in
1947,
and
that
precursor
had
the
word
"technical"
in
it.
the
key
language
which--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--yes,
justice
rehnquist.
then
it
was
amended
in
1948.
the
word
"technical"
was
deleted.
finally,
in
united
states
versus
payner,
this
court
just
18
months
ago
held
that
courts
of
appeals
cannot
exercise
a
supervisory
power
in
a
manner
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
controlling
decisions
of
this
court.
payner,
of
course,
also
involved
an
intentional
transgression
by
a
government
agent,
and
by
contrast
with
this
case.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is,
however,
directly
contrary
to
the
controlling
decision
of
this
court
in
chapman
versus
california.
it
therefore
cannot
stand.
thank
you.
mr.
john
f.
depue
we
maintain,
justice
stevens,
that
you
certainly
could
make
that
decision,
because
the
evidence
is
so
clear.
however,
we
acknowledge
that
this
case
will
have
to
be
remanded
for
the
assessment
of
other
errors.
the
court
of
appeals
left
undecided
a
number
of
errors
in
an
unpublished
decision
that
it
issued
contemporaneously
with
this
one.
so,
the
case
is
going
to
have
to
be
remanded,
and
we
would
certainly
not
have
any
strenuous
objections
if
the
court
were
to
remand
this
issue
as
well.
mr.
john
f.
depue
precisely,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
f.
depue
this
because...
for
three
reasons.
first--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--the
first
is
the
harmless
error
statute.
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
justice
brennan,
and
my
authorities
for
that
again
is
one
case
cited
in
our
brief,
which
is
united
states
versus
palermo,
and
another
case
that
recently
came
to
my
attention
that
was
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
of
which
i
have
apprised
respondents,
united
states
versus
national
city
lines,
which
is
cited
at
334
us
573,
and
the
pertinent
language
is
at
page
589.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
f.
depue
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
have--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--i
think
it
is
questionable.
i
think...
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals
bar,
it
certainly
could.
mr.
john
f.
depue
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
f.
depue
precisely.
and
the
two
alternatives
that
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
was,
the
district
court
itself
could
have
disciplined
the
individual,
and
finally,
the
department
of
justice
could
have
and
would
have
disciplined
an
individual
who
intentionally
violated
chapman.
the
point
i
would
like
to--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--yes,
justice
marshall.
i
believe
i
can.
i
don't
particularly
want
to
use
the
individual's
name,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
within
the
last
eight
months
a
prosecutor--
mr.
john
f.
depue
--we
have
never
had
an
incident
like
this
reported.
no,
justice
marshall.
where
this
particular
type
of
violation
was
reported
to
the
office
of
professional
responsibility.
but
as
i
have
said,
within
the
last
eight
months,
we
had
a
prosecutor
who
was
reported
for
making
improper
comments
before
a
grand
jury,
and
he
ended
up
resigning.
mr.
john
f.
depue
no.
mr.
john
f.
depue
i
know
of
no
examples.
i
would
like
to
dispel
the
notion
that
has
been
created
by
respondents
and
by
the
court
below
that
this
is
a
pervasive
and
recurring
problem
in
the
seventh
circuit.
to
support
this
proposition,
in
both
the
decision
in
this
case
and
the
preceding
rodriguez
decision,
they
cited
a
total
of
eight
cases,
i
believe,
that
occurred
over
some
20
years.
in
only
one
of
these
cases
was
there
an
actual
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
which
the
seventh
circuit
found
was
inadvertent.
in
two
of
the
cases,
they
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
griffin.
in
the
remaining
cases,
they
found
that
remarks
like
"undisputed"
or
"uncontested"
transgressed
this
indistinct
line
that
i
have
discussed
previously,
and
therefore
constituted
what
i
would
term
technical
violations
of
griffin.
you
simply
cannot
use
a
supervisory
power
as
a
prophylaxis,
assuming
it
was
otherwise
amenable,
as
a
prophylaxis
for
prohibiting
unintended
misconduct.
this
was
the
essence
of
judge
larson's
dissent
in
rodriguez.
inadvertent
remarks
aren't
subject
to
a
didactic
lesson.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
concerning
whether
the
phrase
"substantial
rights"
would
preclude
application
of
the
constitutional
harmless
error
standard
in
this
case,
or
in
any
other
case
involving
constitutional
errors,
no,
the
substantial
relates
not
to
the
nature
of
the
right
but
to
the
nature
of
the
injury.
if
substantial
right
were
construed
to
implicate
the
nature
of
the
right
involved,
no
constitutional
error
could
ever
be
deemed
harmless,
because
they
are
all
substantial.
mr.
john
f.
depue
no,
it
didn't
rely
on
the
harmless
error
statute,
but
it
certainly
said,
let
the
statute
and
the
principles
embodied
in
that
statute
apply
to
errors
of
a
constitutional
magnitude,
which
are
invariably
substantial
rights.
mr.
john
f.
depue
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
applied,
of
course,
the
constitutional
harmless
error
doctrine
to
errors
of
a
constitutional
magnitude.
justice
brennan
asked
me
before
whether
the
court
has
ever
held
that
it
can
override
a
statute
under
its
supervisory
power.
in
both
palermo
and
in
national
city
lines,
the
court
said
precisely
that,
that
it
could
not.
thank
you.
