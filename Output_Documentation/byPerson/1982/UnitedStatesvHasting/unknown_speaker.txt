unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
have
to.
unknown
speaker
the
way
you
phrased
the
question
presented,
you
assume
it
is.
you
say
whether
the
closing
argument
that
constitutes
improper
comment
upon
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
justifies
reversal.
so
you
are
assuming--
unknown
speaker
--well,
are
there
other
ways
than
testifying
that
they
could
have
challenged
this?
in
other
words,
by
establishing
that
they
were
in
new
york
city
attending
the
world's
fair
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
mr.
depue,
if
this
court
had
accepted
the
argument
in
chapman
against
california,
i
assume
they
pretty
much
would
have
emptied
the
california
jails,
wouldn't
they,
because
that
had
been
the
standard
practice
in
california
before
griffin
was
decided.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
about
this
court?
unknown
speaker
what
about
this
court?
unknown
speaker
any
decision
of
this
court
that
has
said
that?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
bruno
case,
which
indicated
that
section
2111
was
concerned
basically
with
etiquette
of
trials
and
formalities?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
that
is
correct,
mr.
depue.
was
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
at
issue
in
the
california
trial
that
gave
rise
to
the
appeal
in
chapman
against
california?
unknown
speaker
so
it
wasn't...
the
federal
harmless
error
statute
was
not
involved
at
all
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
a
different
standard
that
the
court
applied
than
the
harmless...
the
statutory
harmless
error
standard.
you
don't
suggest
that
the
griffin
standard
is
the
same
standard
that
was
described
in
justice
rutledge's
opinion
in
kotteakos,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
which
was
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
says
that
you've
got
to
be
sure
that
the
error
does
not
affect
the
substantial
rights
of
the
parties.
now,
do
you
suggest
that
commenting
on
the
failure
of
the
witness
to
get
on
the
witness
stand,
failure
of
the
defendant
to
get
on
the
witness
stand
does
not
affect
a
substantial
right?
unknown
speaker
they
may
be
deemed
harmless,
but
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
would
you
say
that
a
comment
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
witness
stand
does
not
affect
his
constitutional
right
not
to
testify?
unknown
speaker
then
the
statute
simply
does
not
apply.
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying,
in
some
situations
the
comment
on
the
failure
to
testify
affects
the
right,
constitutional
right;
in
others
it
does
not
affect
the
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
then
it
may
well
be
harmless,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
statute
doesn't
apply.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
that,
for
example,
if
television
covers
an
event
in
which
a
crime,
a
murder
takes
place,
that
the
evidence
then
corroborated
by
other
eye
witnesses
is
so
conclusive
that
no
comment
by
the
prosecutor
would
constitute
reversible
error?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
error,
conceding
that
there
is
an
error,
would
be
harmless
in
view
of
the
overwhelming
nature
of
the
evidence.
is
that
your
view?
unknown
speaker
under
your
view,
if
the
defendant
didn't
have
a
lawyer,
and
the
evidence
was
just
as
clear
as
you
hypothesize,
could
that
error
ever
be
harmless?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
made
a
distinction,
or
if
you
have
i
have
missed
it,
between
a
case
where
the
defendant
testifies
and
one
in
which
he
does
not
take
the
stand
at
all.
is
that
a
significant
difference?
unknown
speaker
mr.
depue,
do
you
know
when
28
usc
2111,
the
present
harmless
error
statute,
was
amended
to
have
its
present
form?
unknown
speaker
was
that
the
time
of
the
codification?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
one
that
the
court
construed
in
bruno.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
is
it...
it
is
not
the
government's
position
that
this
court
should
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
there
is
harmless
error,
but
rather
we
should
direct
the
court
of
appeals
to?
unknown
speaker
and
your
view
is
that...
what
you
are
asking
us
to
say
is
that
they
may
not
make
a
harmless
error
determination...
i
mean,
they
must
make
a
harmless
error
determination;
they
may
never
exercise
supervisory
power
on
a
question
like
this,
even
if...
even
if
they...
even
if
we
thought
they
had
here,
and
i
understand
your
position
is,
they
didn't.
unknown
speaker
and
this
because
of
the
harmless
error
statute.
unknown
speaker
but
primarily--
unknown
speaker
--the
harmless
error
statute
you
argue
forecloses
the
exercise
by
the
courts
of
appeals
of
supervisory
power.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
is
there
any
circumstance
in
which
comment,
direct
comment
by
the
prosecutor
on
the
failure
to
testify,
on
the
defendant's
failure
to
testify
could
be
harmless
error?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
discussion
not
to
follow
chapman,
is
pursuant
to
what,
supervisory
power?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
i
can't
tell
from
its
opinion
anything
about
supervisory--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
might...
i
guess
you
have
to
address
the
government's
position,
then,
that
the
harmless
error
statute
forecloses
the
court
of
appeals
from
doing
what
it
did
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
were
promulgated,
as
i
recall,
in
1934.
why
did
congress
not
get
around
to
repealing
this
thing
that
they
felt
was
inconsistent
with
it
until
1947?
unknown
speaker
was
it
in
conflict
with
their
rules
of
criminal
procedure
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
don't
you
think
the
dropping
of
the
word
"technical"
after
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
bruno
had
referred
to
it
as
kind
of
a
matter
of
etiquette
and
that
sort
of
thing,
meant
that
congress
intended
a
little
more
bite
to
the
thing
than
it
had
before?
unknown
speaker
why
need
there
be
any
discussion
if
congress
chooses
to
enact
something
which
in
fact
changes
it?
unknown
speaker
but
how
can
you
be
so
sure
of
that
when
in
fact
the
words
come
out
differently
than
were
in
the
previous
thing,
and
when
it
in
fact
had
been
repealed
for
a
year?
i
mean,
it
is
not
as
if
you
are
just
codifying
something
that
has
always
been
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
go
look
back
at
them,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
your
suggestion
that
this
is
why
they
did
it
they
certainly
didn't
reveal
in
what
they
wrote
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
mr.
esposito,
you
speak
of
this
series
of
seventh
circuit
cases.
how
do
the
facts
of
those
cases
compare
with
this
one?
do
you
have
any
idea?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
underlying
facts
of
the
charges
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
pick
this
case
particularly
when
they
had
let
a
dozen
or
so
go
by?
unknown
speaker
so
these
defendants
as
contrasted
with
the
others
in
perhaps
less
offensive
crimes
were
particularly
fortunate.
unknown
speaker
mr.
esposito,
if
you
are
correct
that
the
court
does
continue
to
have
some
supervisory
power
to
set
aside
convictions
despite
the
provisions
of
section
2111,
should
not
the
court
be
required
to
at
least
articulate
the
fact
that
it
is
exercising
the
supervisory
power,
and
to
set
forth
the
factors
that
informed
its
decision,
and
to
consider
the
public
interest
in
maintaining
a
conviction
in
a
crime
of
this
nature?
aren't
those
things
all
appropriate
for
the
court
to
have
to
consider
and
to
articulate?
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
if
i
might
ask
this
question,
isn't
it
particularly
anomalous
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
set
an
example,
which
it
seemed
to
have
been
doing,
in
an
order
which
is
an
unpublished
order
which
the
parties
are
forbidden
to
cite
in
other
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
a
published
opinion,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
is.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
misunderstood.
i
thought--
unknown
speaker
--i
misunderstood.
unknown
speaker
so
this
part
they
did
publish,
the
part
we
are--
unknown
speaker
--has
the...
excuse
me.
has
the
court
of
appeals
ever
undertaken
to
exercise
any
form
of
supervisory
power
by
disciplinary
action
against
a
lawyer
who
breaks
some
of
the
ground-rules?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
not
the
district
court
have
plenary
jurisdiction
on
admitting
lawyers
to
practice
in
the
district
court
and
in
turn
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
would
the
court
of
appeals
exceed
its
supervisory
powers
or
its
powers
generally
if
they
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
why
a
lawyer
who
violated
rules
in
their
view
should
be
disciplined,
or
the
order
to
show
cause
would
be
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
disciplined?
unknown
speaker
either,
or
both.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
the
district
court
wouldn't
have
been
disciplining
him,
because
they
thought
it
wasn't
even
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
speaking
of
is
the
supervisory
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
over
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
want
to
divert
you.
i
just
wondered
whether--
unknown
speaker
--if
the
court
had
ever
undertaken
to
exercise
such
a
power.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
business
is
that
of
the
court
of
appeals?
the
court
of
appeals
isn't
in
the
business
of
educating
prosecutors.
it
is
in
the
business
of
reviewing
on
an
appellate
basis
decisions
of
the
district
courts,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
so
long
as
it
is
harmless
error,
why
should
the
court
of
appeals
worry
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
effect
does
it
have
on
the
system
if
it
is
harmless
error?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
the
norms
of
conduct
are
set
up,
and
then
reversals
are
not
to
occur
if
there
is
only
harmless
deviation
from
them,
and
by
hypothesis,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
harmless
deviation
from
them.
why
should
that
concern
anybody?
unknown
speaker
it
is
bigger
than
both
of
us?
unknown
speaker
was
this
widespread
throughout
the
seventh
circuit?
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
other
circuits?
unknown
speaker
mr.
esposito,
i
gather
your
answer
to
the
government's
argument
is
that
exercise
of
supervisory
power
is
not
foreclosed
by
the
harmless
error
statute.
why?
because
the
statute,
you
argue,
is
inapplicable
to
this
situation.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
inapplicable?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
i
gather
from
your
colloquy
with
justice
o'connor,
since
there
is
nothing
in
this
opinion
to
tell
us
this
was
reached
on
the
basis
of
supervisory
power,
we
can't
conclude
that
it
was
without
going
back
to
all
those
cases,
the
eight
of
them
that
you
have
cited
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
and
tell
the
court
of
appeals
if
in
fact
u.s.
did
this
on
supervisory
power,
tell
us
so,
and
your
reasons
for
doing
it.
unknown
speaker
before
you
go
on,
let
me
inquire
on
this
point.
in
your
view,
if
a
prosecutor
who
was
admitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
practice
before
the
court
of
appeals
had
committed
a
gross,
not
a
marginal
or
the
kind
that
you
say
here
is
incidental,
but
a
gross
violation
of
the
matter
of
commenting
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
testify,
could
the
court
of
appeals
discipline
that
lawyer?
or
suspend
him?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
assume
that.
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
there.
but
you
agree
that
they
could
suspend
him
from
practice
for
some
period
of
time
as
one
kind
of
discipline.
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
would
be
that
the
conduct
here
doesn't
rise
to
any
such
level.
unknown
speaker
can
you
name
me
any
case
that
it
happened?
unknown
speaker
did
you
have
any
before
eight
months?
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
before
the
court,
where
the
court
disciplined
the
u.s.
attorney.
unknown
speaker
any
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
follow
at
all.
it
would
mean
no
constitutional
error
would
be
covered
by
the
harmless
error
statute.
it
could
still
be
deemed
harmless
under
chapman
against
california
under
the
reasoning
of
that
opinion,
which
did
not
rely
on
the
harmless
error
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
did
not
say...
i
just
reread
it...
that
the
principles
of
that
statute
applied.
it
said
there
is
a
constitutional
harmless
error
statute
which
they
formulated
in
that
case.
