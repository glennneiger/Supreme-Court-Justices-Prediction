mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
turn
first
to
the
single
question
considered
by
the
colorado
district
court.
further,
there
are
already
in
existence
through
routes
by
ogden
and
the
rio
grande
line
between
points
in
the
northwest
or
excluded
territory
and
the
colorado
common
points
and
points
east
to
the
colorado
common
points.
the
commission
divided
five-to-five
on
that
issue
of
fact
and
therefore
refused
to
grant
the
relief
which
rio
grande
requested
and
the
basis
of
through
routes
being
in
existence.
we
accept
the
definition
of
a
through
route
which
counsel
for
the
railroads
have
put
forward
orally
and
in
briefs.
unlike
the
rest
of
the
parties
before
the
court,
we
accept
thompson
of
the
unites
states,
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
as
laying
down
the
controlling
test
for
the
existence
of
a
through
route.
the
thompson
case
was
decided
while
this
case
was
pending
before
the
commission
for
decision,
perhaps
it
had
a
heavy
impact
upon
the
commission.
in
the
thompson
case
this
court
held
that
a
through
route
did
not
exist
where
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
shipment
had
ever
been
made
over
the
alleged
through
route
or
that
the
carriers
had
ever
offered
through
service
over
the
route
and
the
court
stated,
“in
short,
the
test
of
the
existence
of
a
through
route
is
whether
the
participating
carriers
hold
themselves
out
as
offering
through
transportation
service."
then
this
court
stated
that
otherwise
in
that
case.
the
carrier's
course
of
business
negatives
the
existence
of
a
through
route
and
that
was
the
test
which
the
commission
sought
to
apply
on
that
issue
in
this
case.
on
its
report,
the
commission
put
it
this
way,
"it
is
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
carriers
in
this
proceeding
hold
themselves
out
as
offering
through
transportation
service
from
and
to
the
points
here
concerned
by
the
ogden
gateway
as
indicated
by
their
course
of
business
in
respect
of
traffic
over
the
routes
in
question.
the
facts
bearing
upon
the
existence
of
through
routes
are
essentially
undisputed.
as
you've
been
told
for
a
period
of
time
beginning
in
1897
through
routes
and
joint
rates
applying
to
such
routes
were
in
existence
to
and
from
points
in
the
excluded
territory
and
from
and
to
points
east
of
colorado
via
ogden
and
the
rio
grande
line.
by
1912,
union
pacific
had
progressively
canceled
these
joint
rates.
so
far
as
the
record
shows
the
union
pacific
has
never
formally
or
in
terms
purported
to
cancel
through
routes
with
the
rio
grande
and
ogden.
the
evidence
as
to
actual
shipments
over
the
rio
grande
via
ogden
falls
into
several
categories.
during
world
war
ii,
about
19,000
carloads
destined
to
the
excluded
territory,
that
is
coming
from
points
in
the
south
and
east,
were
diverted
by
rio
grande
to
union
pacific
at
ogden
or
salt
lake
city.
these
were
shipments
which
have
been
originally
routed
to
destinations
in
the
excluded
territory
via
rio
grande
and
carriers
such
as
southern
pacific,
western
pacific
with
which
rio
grande
does
have
through
routes
and
joint
rates.
but
these
shipments
were
diverted
by
rio
grande
to
union
pacific
at
ogden
or
salt
lake
pursuant
to
war
time
emergency
routing
orders
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
paragraphs
15
and
16
of
section
1.
also,
during
world
war
ii
several
special
trains
of
troops
and
military
equipment
were
initially
routed
from
southern
and
eastern
points
to
points
of
the
northwest
territory
by
rio
grande,
ogden,
union
pacific.
again,
in
february
1949
when
union
pacific's
main
line
through
cheyenne
was
blocked
with
snow,
union
pacific
diverted
it
to
rio
grande
between
denver
and
utah
junctions
of
those
two
lines
about
1400
carloads.
this
diversion
too
was
pursuant
to
icc
service
orders.
now,
in
addition
to
this
war
time
or
emergency
shipments
there
was
evidence
of
other
scattered
shipments.
in
1948,
a
representative
year
there
were
37
carload
shipments
moved
on
through
bills
of
lading
issued
by
union
pacific
or
other
connecting
carriers
in
the
north
from
points
in
the
northwest
territory
by
union
pacific,
ogden,
rio
grande
to
utah
and
colorado
common
points
served
by
both
union
pacific
and
rio
grande.
and
in
the
same
year
there
were
18
westbound
--
18
carloads
westbound
from
points
in
the
east
by
rio
grande,
ogden,
union
pacific
to
destinations
in
the
northwest
territory.
applying
the
thompson
case
the
commission
made
the
following
findings
as
to
these
actual
shipments.
first
discussing
the
war
time
and
emergency
diversions
of
traffic
the
commission
said,
this
is
at
volume
two
of
the
transcript,
page
1526,
“these
movements
as
well
as
those
under
service
orders
were
made
under
emergency
conditions
and
not
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
carrier's
business.
they
show
only
that
the
rio
grande
routes
were
physically
practicable
and
have
no
bearing
upon
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
these
routes
constitute
through
routes
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
as
used
in
the
act.”
in
order
words,
the
commission
was
recognizing
that
on
those
war
time
and
emergency
diversion
of
traffic,
the
carriers
involved
had
no
choice.
they
acted
under
the
actual
of
potential
compulsion
of
the
commission's
emergency
routing
orders
in
paragraphs
15
and
16
of
--
of
section
1.
more
generally,
the
commission
found
there
is
no
indication
that
any
of
the
defendants
has
ever
solicited
any
traffic
from
and
to
the
areas
here
concerned
for
routing
over
a
rio
grande
route
by
which
a
higher
combination
rate
is
applied
or
has
ever
used
such
a
rio
grande
routing
except
where
called
upon
to
do
so
by
routing
specified
by
a
shipper
or
by
prior
connecting
carrier.
in
the
other
words,
so
far
as
this
record
shows
the
commission
said,
“the
carrier's
course
of
business
has
been
and
is
to
use
the
union
pacific
routes
except
where
called
upon
to
use
the
rio
grande
routes
by
force
of
shippers
or
connecting
carriers'
routing.
the
whole
course
of
conduct
of
union
pacific
so
far
as
revealed
has
been
for
many
years
and
is
now
to
guard
jealously
it's
long
haul
and
not
open
commercially
the
rio
grande
routes
on
this
traffic.”
so,
the
commission
concluded
that
there
were
at
that
time
no
through
routes
over
the
rio
--
or
over
the
rio
grande
via
ogden
or
salt
lake
city.
in
the
evidence
in
support
of
that
conclusion
can
be
summarized
as
--
very
briefly,
it's
undisputed
that
union
pacific
has
not
held
itself
out
in
any
affirmative
or
soliciting
sense
as
offering
through
transportation
service
with
rio
grande
by
ogden.
the
--
the
record
in
this
case
bristles
with
statements,
recognitions,
and
testimony
by
shippers
and
everyone
else
concerned
that
it
was
the
policy
of
union
pacific
to
hold
on
to
it's
long
haul
from
the
northwest
on
it's
own
lines
through
(inaudible)
of
cheyenne
pleased.
with
it
the
commission
correctly
held
that
the
war
time
and
emergency
routing
did
not
constitute
a
course
of
business
or
any
offer
by
union
pacific
of
through
transportation
service.
in
1948,
as
represented
here,
there
were
evidence
of
a
the
total
of
55
carload
shipments
which
moved
on
through
bills
of
lading
over
rio
grande
at
the
higher
combination
rates.
and
the
commission
characterized
these
scattered
commercial
shipments
as
of
an
isolated
nature,
isolated
in
that
that
they
compare
with
total
shipments
of
a
122,000
carloads
moving
in
and
out
of
the
northwest
territory
each
year.
union
pacific
representative
testified
as
to
these
55
shipments,
for
example,
that
they
were
obligated
to
comply
with
the
routing
specified
by
shippers.
and
rio
grande
points
to
this
and
says
that
section
15
(8)
of
the
intestate
commerce
act
only
gives
a
shipper
the
right
to
choose
between
alternative
existing
through
routes.
so,
they
argued
that
if
union
pacific
felt
compelled
as
its
representative
testified
to
honor
that
the
--
to
honor
shippers'
choice
of
routing
that
they
must
have
been
doing
so
under
compulsion
of
section
15
(8)
which
gives
a
choice
only
between
through
routes
and
that
this
amounts
to
an
admission
that
through
routes
were
in
existence.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
evidence
that
some
perhaps
all
of
these
1948
scattered
commercial
shipments
were
routed
by
shippers
who
did
not
--
who
did
not
know
or
who
overlooked
the
fact
that
joint
rates
were
not
applicable
over
the
rio
grande.
and
one
of
these
shipments
for
example,
the
difference
between
joint
rates
over
union
pacific
and
combination
rates
over
rio
grande
amounted
to
$866.
five
members
of
the
commission
joining
in
a
majority
report
held
that
there
must
be
proof
that
through
routes
existed
in
a
practical,
commercially
feasible
sense.
they
were
impressed
by
the
general
thrust
of
section
15
(3)
and
(4)
as
interpreted
only
a
few
weeks
before
by
this
court.
sections
which
represent
careful
congressional
restriction
of
the
power
to
prescribe
new
through
routes
and
the
five
commissioners
felt
that
it
would
be
an
evasion
of
section
15
(4)
defined
that
a
through
route
existed
merely
on
a
showing
that
an
on
occasional
shipper
perhaps
through
an
advertence
specified
movement
over
the
alleged
through
route
despite
the
prohibitively
higher
combination
rates.
on
the
same
evidence,
the
remaining
five
commissioners
were
of
the
view
that
through
routes
were
in
existence
as
alleged
by
rio
grande.
as
stated
in
--
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
commissioners
mahaffey,
splawn
and
cross
concurred,
they
view
the
situation
as
follows,
“all
of
these
evidence
clearly
supports
the
finding
that
the
routes
are
existing
established
through
routes
over
which
through
routes
apply
and
that
the
railroad
participating
therein
consent
to
their
use
as
through
routes
and
freely
hold
themselves
out
as
ready
and
willing
to
perform
transportation
service
wholly.”
and
further,
after
--
after
referring
to
this
court's
decision
in
thompson,
the
three
dissenting
commissioner
said,
“here
is
--
here,
there
is
substantial
evidence
of
a
holding
out
that
through
transportation
will
be
furnished
and
that
execution
of
such
offers
by
the
issuance
of
through
bills
of
lading.”
i
should
point
out
that
those
commissioners
dissenting
relied
upon
the
evidence
of
actual
shipments
both
--
that
those
consisting
at
the
war
time
emergency
routings,
diversion
of
traffic
and
the
--
the
commercial
shipments
as
evidenced
by
the
typical
year
1948.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
you
will
appreciate
i
don't
wish
to
be
too
dilemmatic
in
view
of
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
of
course
they
were
dealing
with
this
situation.
in
this
situation
at
least
the
difference
between
joint
rates
and
combination
rates
was
substantial
of
whether
that
would
always
be
true,
i'm
not
confident
to
say.
in
this
case
the
difference
between
joint
rates
which
would
otherwise
be
applicable,
where
the
transcontinental
joint
rates
applicable
to
all
these
routes.
the
difference
between
those
joint
rates
and
the
combination
rates
was
so
great
as
to
amount
to
a
commercial
closing
of
the
route.
out
of
a
122,000
carloads
of
shipments
a
year
as
in
1948,
only
a
total
of
55
both
eastbound
and
westbound
were
shipped
by
rio
grande,
through
shipments
between
the
eastern
points
to
the
northwest.
then
from
that,
the
five
commissioners
concluded
that
the
roads
were
in
fact
commercially
close
as
though
there
had
been
a
--
a
barrier
placed
across
the
track.
and
the
other
--
the
other
commissioners,
the
other
five
commissioners
in
effect
that
that
there
have
been
some
shipments
through.
they've
been
made
on
through
bills
of
lading.
the
routes
are
at
least
technically
open.
the
rates
which
apply
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
therefore,
we
should
find
that
the
through
routes
existing.
now,
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
test
to
be
applied
as
between
this
division
between
the
commissioners
is,
what
fair
concept
test
for
through
route
were
best
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
congress
particularly
in
section
15.
in
section
15,
particularly
in
section
4,
congress,
and
this
is
the
result
of
repeated
--
repeated
legislative
consideration
has
laid
down
real
restrictions
and
the
power
of
the
commission
to
establish
through
routes
which
will
require
a
carrier
to
short-haul
itself.
and
everybody
admits
that
in
this
situation
the
establishment
of
the
through
routes
or
the
finding
of
the
through
routes
exist
and
it
subjects
union
pacific
to
substantial
short-hauling,
that's
undisputed,
short-hauling
which
brings
the
case
with
--
within
section
15
(4)
and
the
limitation
which
congress
has
carefully
drawn
up
to
protect
carriers'
long-haul.
now
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
rio
grande
filed
a
complaint
in
which
it
alleged
that
through
routes
existed
and
that
union
pacific
was
violating
sections
1,
3
and
15
by
--
by
failing
to
establish
reasonable
joint
rates
with
rio
grande.
so,
the
first
test
--
the
--
the
first
issue
the
commission
had
to
decide
as
posed
by
rio
grande's
complaint,
was
whether
or
not
through
routes
were
already
in
existence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
left
through
--
it
left
the
rio
grande
without
relief
on
that
theory.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
rio
grande
carried
the
burden
of
persuading
in
effect
of
majority.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
yes.
but
only
at
the
higher
--
only
in
--
prohibitively
high
combination
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
that
was
the
first
question
the
commission
had
to
decide.
that
--
that
was
the
issue
strongly
controverted
by
union
pacific.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
no.
the
union
--
rio
grande
was
very
much
dissatisfied
of
what
they
had
before
them.
they
asked
the
commission
to
hold,
to
find
that
through
routes
were
in
existence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
thereafter
to
order
rio
--
to
order
union
pacific
and
the
other
defendant
railroads
to
establish
joint
rates
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
with
rio
grande
over
those
routes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
they
did
indeed.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
only
affirmative
action
they
have
that
--
the
only
affirmative
action
they
asked
for
was
the
establishment
of
joint
rates
that
was
on
the
assumption
as
they
claim
in
their
complaint
that
the
through
routes
were
already
in
existence.
but
since
it
was
denied
by
the
defendant
carriers
that
through
routes
did
exist,
the
first
issue
that
the
commission
had
to
resolve
was
whether
or
not
through
routes
were
in
existence.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
each
of
the
10
did.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
each
of
the
10,
they
simply
disagreed
with
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
indeed,
it's
not.
i
--
i
can
only
say
that
the
basic
facts
involved
are
essentially
undisputed
and
as
your
honor
knows,
the
district
--
the
district
court
in
colorado
resolved
them
by
--
by
holding
--
by
finding
that
through
routes
did
in
fact
exist.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
nebraska
court
never
passed
upon
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
issue
of
the
existence
of
through
routes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
was
not
presented
to
them.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
fair,
by
implication.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
adjournment
yesterday,
i
had
presented
the
facts
relating
to
the
issue
of
whether
through
routes
were
already
in
existence
between
the
so-called
excluded
or
northwest
territory
and
via
ogden
in
the
rio
grande
to
points
in
the
eastern
and
southern
parts
of
the
united
states.
to
summarize
those
facts
very
briefly,
union
pacific
does
not
offer
through
transportation
with
rio
grande
on
the
traffic
here
involved,
admittedly,
by
publishing
with
rio
grande
only
prohibitively
higher
combination
rates.
union
pacific
seeks
to
preserve
its
own
long-haul
on
this
traffic.
substantial
war
time
and
emergency
routings
of
traffic
have
been
made
via
rio
grande,
ogden
and
union
pacific.
in
addition,
a
trickle
of
commercial
shipments,
totaling
55
and
they're
represented
at
the
year
1948,
have
passed
over
rio
grande
via
ogden
and
the
union
pacific.
the
opposing
views
on
this
issue
within
the
commission,
i
submit,
pinpoint
this
difficult
question.
is
it
enough
that
a
through
route
exist
in
a
technical
sense
and
that
a
shipper
who
is
willing
to
pay
the
higher
combination
rate
may
specify
the
alleged
through
route
and
that
connecting
carriers
will
comply
with
such
a
shipper's
routing
instruction
and
issue
a
through
bill
of
lading?
or
must
there
be
a
proof
that
a
through
route
exist
in
a
realistic
commercial
sense
in
that
the
connecting
carriers
affirmatively
hold
themselves
out
as
providing
through
transportation
over
the
particular
route
or
in
the
sense
that
shippers
make
a
substantial
use
of
the
alleged
through
route?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
there
is
no
evidence
on
union
pacific,
on
any
of
the
other
carriers
refusing
to
honor
a
routing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
specified
by
shipment
--
specified
by
shippers
via
rio
grande.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
sir.
those
facts,
i
think,
i've
--
i've
just
summarized
in
capsule
form
and
those
facts
so
far
as
i
know
are
substantially
undisputed
by
any
of
the
parties.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
evidenced
by
representatives
of
union
pacific
and
rio
grande
and
--
and
that
--
by
that
--
by
that
testimony
while
it
did
not
necessarily
meet
was
not
contradictory.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.if
what
the
rio
grande--
if
what
the
union
pacific
witness
was
referring
to
was
section
15
(8),
that
would
be
so.
15
(8)
of
the
act
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
didn't
specify.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
shipper
has
arrived.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
the
shipper
have
the
choice
of
routing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
from
that
rio
grande
contends
and
the
district
court
held
that
this
amounted
to
an
admission
by
union
pacific
that
the
through
routes
here
in
issue
were
in
existence
because,
contends
rio
grande,
section
15
(8)
gives
the
shipper
the
choice
of
routing
only
where
there
are
two
--
two
or
more
through
routes
in
existence.
where
there
are
two
or
more
through
routes
in
existence,
the
shipper
can
specify
which
are
the
through
routes
he
wishes
to
use.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
would
be
evidence.
now
--
but
there
--
there
still
is
the
question,
the
basic
question
which
divided
the
commission,
further
evidence
that
occasional
shipments
are
routing
--
with
the
--
with
the
shippers
routing
being
honored
by
the
carriers
over
the
alleged
through
route.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
--
that's
correct.
now
--
so,
the
issue
is,
it
divided
the
commission
5-to-5
where
there
--
where
a
through
route
exists
in
a
technical
legal
sense
--
whether
--
whether
that
is
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
through
route
for
the
purposes
of
the
act
in
view
of
the
--
of
the
safeguards
which
congress
in
section
15
(4)
has
thrown
around
the
carrier's
long-haul.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
if
a
through
route
does
not
exist
in
even
a
technical
legal
sense
then
the
carrier
is
not
--
is
not
the
--
the
receiving
or
originating
carrier
is
not
obligated
to
issue
a
through
bill
of
lading.
of
course,
it
couldn't.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
if
there
--
if
--
if
between
carriers
a
and
b,
it's
--
if
it's
clear
that
--
that
there's
no
through
route,
then
--
then
the
originating
carrier
need
issue
a
bill
of
lading
only
covering
the
transportation
service
which
it
offers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
whereas
if
--
if
carriers
a
and
b
have
joined
in
a
through
route
then
the
originating
carrier
must
issue
a
bill
of
lading
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
covering
the
entire
service
which
it
is
offering
either
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
the
connecting
carrier
with
whom
it
has
a
through
route.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
and
if
there
are
alternative
through
routes
then
section
15
(8),
it
gives
the
shipper
the
right
to
specify
which
of
the
alternative
through
routes
to
be
employed.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
sir,
i
agree
entirely.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
i
--
and
i
refer
to
the
5-to-5
division
merely
as
--
as
evidencing
that
--
that
it
was
considered
a
difficult
question.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
since
the
burden
of
proof
or
persuasion
was
upon
rio
grande,
the
commission's
report,
full
report
concurred
in
by
five
members
of
the
commission
in
finding
--
in
--
in
which
it
was
found
that
through
routes
did
not
exist,
that
that
should
be
treated
as
the
order
of
the
--
of
the
commission
which
was
open
to
challenge
in
the
courts.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
i
am
about
to
take
it,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
no
--
no
intention
of
trying
to
stay
on
fence,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
our
position.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
understand.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
i
understand,
sir.
my
answer
--
perhaps,
i
can
answer
the
question
this
way.
all
10
members
of
the
commission
participating
in
the
proceeding
treated
the
long
report
concurred
in
by
five
commissioners
as
representing
the
agency
decision.
the
others
in
their
separate
reviews
refer
to
themselves
as
partly
concurring
or
partly
dissenting
and
referred
to
the
long
report
as
the
majority
report.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
--
i
have
to
take
that
position,
your
honor,
otherwise
there
--
there'd
be
a
gap
in
the
administration
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
perhaps
they
had,
sir.
i
think
--
i
think
we
have
to
take
the
position
we're
taking.otherwise
rio
--
otherwise
i
think
rio
grande
to
be
in
the
position
of
being
denied
a
forum
of
what's
claimed.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
you're
entirely
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
facts
which
--
which
both
group
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
pointed
out
were
the
same
facts
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
and
--
and
are
not
challenged
by
any
part
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
if
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
that's
also
true,
sir.
that
as
to
the
basic
facts
to
which
the
standard
was
to
be
applied,
all
--
all
of
the
commission
will
agree.
in
fact,
those
facts
are
not
disputed
in
this
litigation
at
all.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
have
to
say
that
they
could
not
have
refused
to
accept
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
other
shipment
because
--
because
rio
grande's
officers
or
one
of
rio
grande's
--
one
of
union
pacific's
officers
testified
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
they
were
obligated
to
honor
the
--
the
shipper's
route.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
their
basic
position,
i
think
i'm
stating
their
position
fairly,
is
that
they
have,
as
a
practical
realistic
commercial
matter,
closed
the
route
by
refusing
to
join
with
rio
grande
in
--
in
joint
rates
and
--
and
in
--
in
joining
rio
grande
only
in
combination
rates
which
is
an
--
for
practical
purposes
are
prohibitively
high.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
part.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
--
that
there's
more
than
that
here
and
that
the
record
bristles
with
statements
or
concessions
that
--
that
union
pacific's
course
--
course
of
business
has
been
to
protect
its
long-haul
on
this
traffic.
that
it
in
no
way
solicits
in
any
affirmative
sense
at
all
traffic
to
be
handled
on
a
through
route
and
joint
rates
with
rio
grande.
well,
that
has
been
their
--
one
of
their
basic
commercial
positions
through
many
years
since
1912.
and
that
in
fact
very
few
shipments
have
moved
at
this
higher
combination
rates
leaving
aside
the
--
the
war
time
and
emergency
shipments.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir,
it
would
be.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
--
on
this
record
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
unable
to
say
how
important.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
this
record,
the
--
the
entire
emphasis
has
been
on
the
rates,
the
--
the
rate
disparity.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly,
where
the
disparity
is
as
great
as
it
is
in
this
case.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
they
could
publish
in
their
--
publish
in
their
tariffs
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
to
--
to
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
to
--
to
the
effect
that
they
would
not
provide
through
transportation
with
rio
grande
even
at
combination
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
can
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
put
this
by
--
by
implication,
the
statute
authorizes
a
carrier
to
cancel
through
routes
and
joint
rates
but
the
commission
may,
after
a
hearing,
block
that
cancelation,
set
--
set
aside
such
cancelation.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
can't
find
it
now,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry.
but
in
--
but
in
effect,
it
provided
that
a
carrier
may
cancel
existing
through
routes
and
joint
rates
and
subject
to
veto
by
the
commission.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it's
very
--
be
very
glad
to.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
think
the
question
as
to
what
should
be
the
proper
test
for
the
existence
of
a
through
route
must
be
resolved
largely
in
terms
of
what
test
is
necessary
to
carry
out
the
congressional
purpose
in
section
15
(4).
by
repeated
amendments
to
section
15
(4),
as
this
court
has
noted,
congress
has
laid
down
a
clear
purpose
to
protect
railroad
carriers
in
their
long-hauls
and
has
done
this
by
carefully
restricting
the
commission's
power
to
prescribe
new
through
routes.
in
the
thompson
case,
the
court
told
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
the
policy
of
section
15
(4)
was
not
to
be
evaded
by
using
a
too
easy
test
as
to
the
existence
of
--
of
through
routes.
specifically
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
fact
that
through
transportation
between
two
carriers
is
physically
possible
in
the
sense
that
there's
a
physical
interconnection
between
the
two
lines.
but
that
is
not
enough
to
establish
the
existence
of
a
through
route.
the
court
said
that
rather
the
test
is
whether
the
participating
carriers
hold
themselves
out
as
offering
through
transportation
service
and
the
court
could
have
otherwise
of
whether
the
--
whether
the
carriers
course
of
business
reflects
the
existence
of
a
through
route.
and
i
submit
that
in
view
of
that
policy
of
section
15
(4)
against
carriers
being
forced
to
short-haul
themselves,
that
the
holding
out
or
the
course
of
business
required
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
through
route
should
consist
of
representative
conduct
of
carrier,
that
the
facts
should
affirmatively
show
that
the
carrier
either
affirmatively
offers
through
transportation
or
that,
without
objection
by
the
carriers
which
--
which
is
being
short-hauled,
the
public
is
making
a
substantial
use
of
the
alleged
through
route.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
union
pacific
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
--
at
combination
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
advertised
may
be
too
strong
a
word.
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
i
could
use
that
fairly.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
--
i
can
say
this
at
no
time
did
union
pacific
take
any
formal
action
to
cut
off
the
--
the
old
through
routes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
believe
that
is
correct,
sir.
so,
applying
those
principles,
the
correct
principles
which
we
--
we
deduced
from
the
thompson
decision,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
evidence
of
substantial
war
time
and
emergency
shipments
by
union
pacific,
ogden
and
rio
grande
should
be
disregarded.
those
shipments
were
neither
voluntary
on
the
part
of
--
of
union
pacific
nor
representative
of
its
course
of
business.
there
were
diversions
of
traffic
made
under
the
compulsion
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
emergency
routing
powers.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
my
answer
to
that
would
be
that
the
holding
out
is
not
a
realistic
holding
out.
it's
a
holding
out
of
through
transportation
service
only
at
prohibitively
high
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
shippers
by
and
large
have
decided
that
they
don't
want
to
pay
those
rates
and
that
out
of
121,000
carloads
of
the
traffic
which
is
what's
here
involved
between
the
northwest
territory
and
points
in
the
east
and
south.
in
1948,
only
55,
both
eastbound
and
westbound,
moved
over
to
higher
combination
rates
over
rio
grande.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
there's
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
at
--
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
at
least
some
of
these
--
some
of
those
shipments
were
made
through
inadvertence
by
shippers
who
didn't
--
who
did
not
realize
that
joint
rates
were
not
applicable.
and
we
think
that
these
few
commercial
shipments,
total
of
55
in
the
represented
year
of
1948,
again
are
too
few
to
constitute
either
--
to
reflect
either
an
effective
realistic
holding
out
by
rio
grande
or
to
constitute
any
substantial
use
by
shippers
with
the
union
pacific's
acquiescence.
after
finding
that
through
routes
via
rio
grande
were
not
already
in
existence,
the
commission
considered
whether
it
should
prescribe
new
through
routes
and
joint
rates
applicable
to
those
routes.
under
the
standards
and
limitations
of
--
of
paragraphs
(3)
and
(4)
of
section
15,
section
15
(3)
empowers
the
commission
whenever
deemed
by
it
to
be
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest
to
establish
new
through
routes
and
joint
rates
applicable
to
such
routes.
however,
since
it
would
--
it's
conceded
that
the
routes
proposed
here
would
require
union
pacific
to
short-haul
itself,
the
commission
also
had
to
take
into
consideration
and
stated
that
it
was
taking
into
consideration
the
restriction
of
section
15
(4)
which
provides
that
in
establishing
any
such
through
route,
the
commission
shall
not,
except
as
provided
in
section
3,
require
any
railroad
to
short-haul
itself
with
provisos
and
the
pertinent
exception
here
is
unless
the
commission
finds
that
the
through
route
proposed
to
be
established
is
needed
in
order
to
provide
adequate
and
more
efficient
or
more
economic
transportation
service.
i
would
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
reiterated
contention
of
union
pacific
in
briefs
and
in
oral
argument
that
the
commission
treated
this
case
as
a
financial
needs
case
in
violation
of
the
command
of
section
15
(4)
that
through
routes
which
would
short-haul
the
carrier
shall
not
be
established
by
the
commission
to
assist
another
carrier
in
meeting
its
financial
needs.
now,
that
contention
of
union
pacific
is
simply
not
true.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
not,
before.
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
correct,
sir.
but
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
to
restrict
the
commission's
power
to
establish
new
routes
which
would
short-haul
the
carrier.
and
it's
in
the
light
of
that
continuing
persistent
congressional
purpose
shown
in
repeated
amendments
to
section
15
(4)
that
we
think
the
test
to
be
adopted
for
determining
whether
through
routes
are
already
in
existence
should
be
a
realistic
practical
test.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
can
voluntarily
short-haul
themselves
without
any
restriction
in
the
statute.
now,
this
case
was
not
tried
as
a
financial
needs
case.
the
record
doesn't
--
doesn't
begin
to
contain
evidence
on
which
the
commission
could
treat
it
as
a
financial
needs
case.
and
the
commission
specifically
stated
in
reaching
our
conclusions
herein
that
no
consideration
has
been
given
to
the
financial
needs
of
the
complainant.
indeed,
the
principal
evidence
as
to
financial
need
presented
in
this
case
with
the
union
pacific
witness
testified
that
it
--
its
financial
needs
were
greater
than
those
of
rio
grande.
the
commission's
ultimate
finding
and
this
is
in
volume
two
of
the
record
at
page
1578
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
from
the
very
beginning,
union
pacific
has
been
taking
the
position
that
rio
grande
was
bringing
before
the
commission
a
financial
needs
case
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
than
a
--
than
a
consistent
position.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
what
i
--
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
the
record
does
not
begin
to
contain
the
complete
financial
data
on
which
an
agency
would
have
to
determine
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
just
quite
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
--
of
course.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
--
the
financial
affairs
of
both
carriers
are
matters
of
--
of
public
knowledge.
the
commission's
ultimate
finding
was
that
it
is
necessary
and
desirable
in
the
public
interest
in
order
to
provide
adequate
and
more
economic
transportation
that
through
routes
and
joint
rates
over
such
routes,
the
same
as
apply
over
union
pacific
in
its
connecting
lines,
be
established
via
ogden
in
connection
with
the
rio
grande.
that
the
commission
sharply
limited
its
order,
was
best
establishing
new
through
routes
to
the
following
commodity,
to
carload
shipments
of
granite
and
marble
monuments
from
vermont
and
georgia
to
points
in
the
northwest
territory
and
then
more
important
to
carload
shipments
of
ordinary
livestock,
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables,
dried
beans,
frozen
poultry,
frozen
foods,
butter
and
eggs,
from
origins
in
the
excluded
territory
to
destinations
east
and
south
of
the
following
area.
it
was
excluded
from
this
grant
of
through
routes,
this
area
that
was
excluded
for
the
reason
that
for
destinations
in
that
area,
the
commission
found
that
the
use
of
rio
grande's
routes
was
too
circulus
for
the
establishment
of
--
of
through
routes
to
those
points
to
be
in
the
public
interest.
the
commission's
ultimate
findings
were
based
upon
the
following
facts
as
to
the
needs
of
shippers,
not
as
to
the
needs
of
rio
grande
but
as
to
the
needs
of
shippers.
and
in
view
of
the
statements
made
to
this
court
yesterday
that
there
was
no
record
that
there
were
neither
findings
nor
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
order
in
this
respect.
this
evidence
is
set
forth
in
considerable
detail,
first
in
the
commission's
report
in
the
record
at
volume
two,
pages
1547
and
page
1564
and
on
the
government's
brief
in
--
between
pages
20
and
36.
summarizing
that
evidence
briefly,
the
excluded
northwest
territory
produces
substantial
quantities
of
livestock,
vegetables,
fresh
fruits
generally.
there,
it
developed
an
elaborate
system
from
marketing
these
commodities
which
involves
extensive
use
of
intransit
privileges
such
as
feeding,
packing,
freezing
and
so
on.
these
intransit
privileges
are
available
in
practically
all
railroads
including
both
rio
grande
and
union
pacific
but
as
a
practical
matter,
shippers
can
afford
to
use
this
intransit
privileges
on
a
particular
carrier's
line
only
if
after
reprocessing
or
freezing,
as
the
case
may
be,
the
commodities
can
be
reshipped
on
the
balance
of
joint
rates.
similar
of
these
commodities
can
be
reconsigned
while
on
route
as
buyers
and
markets
are
found,
only
through
reconsignment
--
only
through
rerouting
can
be
done
at
joint
rates.
now,
to
illustrate,
sheep
and
cattle
produced
in
the
northwest
area,
the
area
serve
by
union
pacific,
are
desirable
for
feeding
and
breeding
purposes.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
good
grazing
areas
in
utah
and
colorado
in
the
areas
served
by
the
rio
grande.
livestock
is
fattened
in
those
feeding
and
grazing
areas
and
reshipped
to
other
parts
of
the
country.
if
livestock
is
moved
from
the
excluded
area
for
feeding
in
area
served
only
by
rio
grande
in
utah
and
colorado,
that
livestock,
after
feeding,
can
be
reshipped
to
points
beyond
the
rio
grande's
lines
only
if
the
combination
rates
which
are
substantially
higher
than
would
be
the
balance
of
joint
rates.
the
result
is
to
deprive
livestock
growers
in
the
excluded
territory
of
the
market
for
their
livestock
represented
by
the
feeding
lots
in
utah
and
colorado
served
only
by
the
rio
grande
and
it
deprives
the
feeders
served
only
by
the
rio
grande
of
access
to
the
feeding
stock
produced
in
the
northwest
area.
a
similar
situation
exists
with
respect
to
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
which
are
grown
in
substantial
volume
either
in
idaho,
washington
and
oregon.
there
exist
on
the
rio
grande,
a
point
served
only
by
the
rio
grande,
numerous
processors,
dealers
in
such
commodities
but
if
they
buy
fruits
and
vegetables,
potatoes,
produced
in
the
excluded
territory
for
processing,
packing
and
so
on,
on
the
rio
grande
that
can
--
they
cannot
ship
such
commodities
after
processing
in
transit
to
points
beyond
the
rio
grande
except
at
the
higher
combination
rates.
and
in
the
case
of
the
fruits
and
vegetables,
potatoes,
there's
still
a
further
factor.
those
commodities
are
frequently
shipped,
put
on
cars
and
started
moving
generally
toward
the
east
at
a
time
when
--
when
a
--
before
a
buyer
has
been
obtained.
so
that
the
right
to
reconsign
as
buyers
are
found
or
as
a
buyer
has
lost
and
another
buyer
is
found
is
very
important.
those
reconsignment
privileges
exist
on
practically
all
railroads
including
union
pacific
and
rio
grande,
but
the
reconsignment
privileges
are
practically
unavailable
unless
they
can
be
exercised
on
through
rates
and
on
a
balance
of
--
on
joint
rates
or
on
a
balance
of
joint
rates.
for
example,
if
an
idaho
shipper
routes
a
carload
of
potatoes
under
--
via
rio
grande
and
while
on
rio
grande
he
finds
a
buyer
at
a
point
beyond
--
beyond
rio
grande's
lines,
he
can
reroute
only
at
the
higher
combination
rates.
that
means
that
he
will
probably,
in
most
instances,
have
to
sell
the
potatoes
at
a
sacrificed
price
rather
an
attempt
to
reconsign
them
or
reroute
them
at
the
combination
rates,
that's
called
a
pocket
market.
in
the
case
of
the
same
shipper,
for
example,
these
ships
bound
to
oklahoma
on
--
on
a
through
route
by
union
pacific
and
then
wants
to
reroute
into
the
southeastern
part
of
united
states
as
he
finds
a
buyer,
he
can
do
so
only
at
the
higher
combination
rates.
that's
because
the
union
pacific
and
shipments
coming
out
of
the
northwest
territory
will
allow
through
routes
to
the
north
--
to
destinations
in
the
southeast
or
in
the
shipments
that
utilize
union
pacific
long-haul
to
either
omaha
or
kansas
city.
the
shipment
ends
up
down
here.
if
the
idaho
shipper
wants
to
reconsign
the
points
to
the
southeast,
he
can
do
so
only
at
the
higher
combination
rates,
whereas
to
such
a
shipper,
the
entire
southwest
area
is
a
pocket
market.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
those
were
the
commodities
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
as
to
which
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
those
were
the
commodities
as
to
which
a
convincing
showing
as
to
a
particular
shipper
need
was
made
because
the
--
the
commission,
in
--
in
order
to
find
through
routes
in
this
situation
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
new
through
routes
had
to
find
both
the
public
interest,
general
public
interest
as
required
by
section
15
(3)
and
it
also
had
to
find
under
section
15
(4),
since
short-hauling
was
involved,
that
--
that
there
was
a
need
for
adequate
and
economic
or
efficient
transportation.
and
to
find
that,
it
looked
and
relied
only
upon
specific
proof
of
some
specific
shipper
need
and
had
--
had
found
that
specific
shipper
need
in
the
need
for
growers
of
these
commodities,
livestock
and
the
fruits
and
vegetables
in
the
northwest,
to
have
access
to
the
markets
represented
by
transit
facilities,
marketing
and
--
and
processing
facilities
on
the
rio
grande
and
--
plus
their
need
to
be
able
to
ship
to
rio
grande
points
and
still
be
able
to
reconsign
to
other
points
at
the
balance
of
joint
rates
rather
than
that
prohibitively
higher
combination
rates.
that
is
why
the
commission's
order
was
so
limited.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
their
--
their
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
strong
position
is
that
these
--
that
these
broader
markets
embodied
in
the
commission's
order
for
producers
of
livestock,
fruits
and
vegetables
in
the
northwest
should
be
made
available.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
not
parties,
they
appeared
as
--
as
witnesses.
some
were
parties,
others
appeared
as
witnesses.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
the
department
of
agriculture
appealed
only
from
the
nebraska
decision.
they
took
an
appeal
solely
from
nebraska
decision,
solely
for
this
reason,
the
nebraska
court
cut
down
the
scope
of
the
relief
which
the
commission
granted.
the
nebraska
court
upheld
the
commission
to
order
only
as
to
commodities
which
are
initially
routed
to
points
on
the
rio
grande
for
intransit,
the
operations
there
and
the
department
of
agriculture
took
an
appeal
from
that
limitation.
they
contend
as
to
the
united
states
and
the
commission
that
the
nebraska
court
should
not
have
restricted
the
order,
that
as
to
fruits
and
vegetables
in
particular,
it
should
have
left
the
order
intact
so
that
the
shippers
of
fruits
and
vegetables
in
the
northwest
territory
may
exercise
reconsignment
privileges
effectively
along
--
along
the
rio
grande
as
well
as
intransit
privileges.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
distinction
should
have
been
made
there
because
they
did
not
take
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
sir
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
your
honor,
which
record
is
this?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
should
make
it
clear
that
the
commission
did
not
find,
indeed
rio
grande
does
not
contend
that
union
pacific
does
not
render
good
service
on
its
routes.
the
commission
made
no
finding
that
union
pacific
does
not
render
adequate
service
on
its
routes.
the
commission's
finding
was
that
these
shippers
of
these
specified
commodities
in
the
northwest
territory
need
through
routes
and
joint
rates
via
rio
grande
in
order
to
--
to
take
advantage
of
the
markets
represented
by
the
intransit
facilities
served
only
by
rio
grande
points
and
in
order
--
to
be
able
to
exercise
effectively
reconsignment
privileges
over
the
rio
grande.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
your
reference
to
the
record
at
117,
are
you
referring,
sir,
to
the
material
beginning,
"the
union
pacific
operates
about
9000
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
--
no
sir.
we
don't
see
any
inconsistency
there
for
this
reason,
that
there
--
no
one
challenges
the
fact
that
union
pacific,
on
its
routes,
furnishes
adequate
transportation
service.
the
commission's
order
was
based
upon
the
proposition.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
adequate
for
moving
these
commodities
along
union
pacific's
routes.
what
the
commission
found,
the
basis
for
its
action
was
that
shippers
or
the
commodities
in
question
in
the
northwest
territory
needed
through
routes
and
joint
rates
via
ogden
and
rio
grande
in
order
to
have
access
to
the
marketing
facilities
and
processors
on
the
rio
grande,
points
on
the
rio
grande
not
served
by
union
pacific.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
based
on
entirely
on
that.
that's
why
the
commission's
order
establishing
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
on
--
on
up's
routes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
--
but
the
commission
didn't
operate
just
on
the
basis
that
it
would
be
nice
in
some
general
way
to
have
an
additional
through
route.
it
acted
only
on
the
basis
of
a
showing
and
only
as
far
as
that
showing
went,
the
particular
commodities,
that
there
was
a
specific
need,
specific
needs
of
specific
groups
of
shippers
for
the
through
routes
and
joint
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
the
commission
--
the
commission's
order
will
have
to
rest
upon
the
basis
which
it
gave
for
it,
and
the
basis
it
gave
for
it
was,
as
i
say,
these
specific
--
specific
needs
of
these
--
the
shippers
of
these
particular
commodities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
at
prohibitive
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
--
at
prohibitive
disadvantages.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
of
the
higher
combination
rates.
they
were
not
--
there
is
a
--
they
were
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
the
ship
--
i
will
admit
that
the
shipments
and
monuments
are
rather
minute
in
comparison
to
the
shipments
of
livestock
and
fruits
and
vegetables.
but
the
--
