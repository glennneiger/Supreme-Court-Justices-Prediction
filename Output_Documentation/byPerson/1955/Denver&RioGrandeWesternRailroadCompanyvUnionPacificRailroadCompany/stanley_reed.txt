a

entirely
with
the

i
understand
that,
but
there
--
i
--
i
said
a
joint
rate.
justice
stanley

if
--
if
--
it
turns
a
--
if
you
got
what
you
wanted
here
so
that
you
could
come
through,
would
the
shipper
have
the
choice
of
--
justice
stanley
reed
no
--
there's
no
division
of
freight
or
anything
like
that?
justice
stanley

what
the
--
the
commission

on
the
fact
that

either
discriminatory
to
the
shipper,
are
discriminatory
between

is
it
not?
justice
stanley

i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
--
i
don't
understand
what
--
what
you
say
about
15
(4)
and
that
the
provisions
of
section
3
can't
be
taken
into
consideration,
you'll
have
to
deal
with
15
(4).
justice
stanley
reed
why
--
why
is
that
accepted
in
15
(4)
there
except
as
provided
--
section
3
in
this
title?
justice
stanley
reed
but
you
--
you
would
nullify
it.
necessarily,
you
would
--
you'd
take
section
3
which
applies
for
--
against
unreasonable
purposes
or
undue
purposes
(inaudible)
so
that
you
can
short-haul.
there's
--
there's
no
situation
like
that.
justice
stanley
reed
i
was
expressing
an
opinion
about
that.
i
don't
understand
why
you
held
section
3
proviso
in
there
if
it
wasn't
so
perfectly
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
five-to-five,
did
it
leave
the
all
through
routes
in?
well,
how
--
how
did
the
motion
come
or
how
did
the
request
come
forth
the
commission
for
a
declaration
on
that
there
was
a
through
rate?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
why
--
why
solely
if
there
were
rates
before?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

--
the
through
routes,
as
to
the
combination
though
not
a
joint
rate.
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
--
do
you
challenge
any
of
the
facts
since
it
were
relied
on
by
the
colorado
court?
justice
stanley
reed
there
was
evidence
by
the
traffic
witnesses
of
the
union
pacific
that
--
that
they
had
moved
that
way?
justice
stanley
reed
no,
but
what
i'm
thinking
about
looking
aren't
on
these.
that
the
principal
traffic
witness
of
the
union
pacific
testified
of
shipper
who
was
willing
to
pay
the
higher
combination
rate,
had
the
right
to
specify
under
15
(8)
(inaudible)
via
the
rio
grande.
and
then
it
said
this
is
going
to
--
the
court
said
that
this
would
only
be
where
there
was
a
through
rate
--
through
route.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

referring
to
as
i
understand.
justice
stanley
reed
no
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
he
simply
said
that
any
ship
that
comes
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
and
move
over
the
rio
grande
from
whatever
the
point
of
origin
was
to
the
point
of
destination
east
of
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
then
if
you
--
if
you
accept
that,
there
would
be
(inaudible)
that
there
was
a
through
route.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
have
wanted
to
have
routed
but
if
there
is
a
right
through
route.
there's
a
difference
between
the
case
of
the
shippers
who
may
be
routed
and
one
where
there
is
a
right
to
demand
that
they
be
routed.
justice
stanley
reed
are
you
saying
(voice
overlap)
--if
they
only
have
a
through
route,
he
must
still
may,
must
he
not,
the
originating
carrier
issue
a
through
bill
of
lading?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
does
that
--
except
in
the
very
unusual
situation
of
stoppage
of
transit,
it
would
always
be
commercially
an
unfeasible
ship
with
a
higher
rate
i
take
it.
justice
stanley
reed
how
would
--
how
would
the
union
pacific
have
--
assume
that
there
were
--
is
a
route
here,
how
could
the
union
pacific
have
got
away
with
it?
justice
stanley
reed
and
have
that
been
approved
--
justice
stanley
reed
by
the
icc?
justice
stanley
reed
and
that's
not
under
any
specific
provisional
statute?
justice
stanley
reed
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
is
there
a
statutory
authority
authorizing
to
cancel
through
routes?
justice
stanley
reed
perhaps,
you
would
give
us
--
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
ginnane,
what
--
what
is
the
interest?
why
wasn't
--
this
order
of
the
commission
was
restricted
in
this
particular
commodity?
justice
stanley
reed
there
--
there
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
--
that
moves
in
this
way.
justice
stanley
reed

you
say

justice
stanley

do
you

do
you
speak
also
for
the
department
of
agriculture?
justice
stanley

what
is
there

(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
if
the
department
of
agriculture
had
--
had

that
you
suggest
then
why
did
they
take
