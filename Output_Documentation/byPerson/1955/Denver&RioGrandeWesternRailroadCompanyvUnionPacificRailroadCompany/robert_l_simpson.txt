mr.
robert
l.
simpson
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
try
to
confine
my
remarks
to
about
five
minutes.
i
am
an
assistant
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
washington
and
i'm
appearing
here
today
along
with
mr.
overcash,
for
these
states
of
washington,
oregon,
wyoming,
montana
and
nebraska.
these
five
states
have
intervened
to
these
proceeding
from
the
very
inception
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
we
have
been
in
opposition
to
the
proposal
of
the
rio
grande.
i
am
only
going
to
try
to
very
briefly
touch
upon
one
or
two
matters
as
they
reflect
the
record
in
respect
to
my
part
of
the
country,
the
pacific
northwest.
these
states
before
the
icc,
made
it
undisputedly
clear
that
in
there
area,
there
was
no
need
for
the
proposed
routes
of
the
rio
grande.
it
was
made
just
as
clear
that
the
granting
of
financial
relief
through
this
bridge
line
railroad
by
approving
its
proposals
in
the
absence
of
any
need
or
benefit
from
the
route
would
adversely
affect
our
economy
in
the
existing
services.
now,
we're
presently
served
in
the
pacific
northwest
by
some
five
transcontinental
railroads,
the
milwaukee,
the
southern
pacific,
the
great
northern,
the
northern
pacific
and
the
union
pacific.
this
record
shows
without
contradiction.
first
in
respect
to
the
state
of
washington
that
there
was
not
one
shipper
who
was
in
favor
of
the
proposed
routes
of
the
rio
grande,
all
the
shipper
witnesses
that
intervened
in
this
proceeding
from
the
state
of
washington,
opposed
without
exception,
the
proposal
of
the
rio
grande.
they
showed
conclusively
that
there
was
no
need
for
this
longer
route.
out
of
the
four
states
of
oregon,
washington,
montana
and
wyoming,
but
two
individual
shippers
from
the
state
of
oregon
came
forward
on
behalf
of
the
rio
grande.
one
of
those
two
testified
that
the
only
purpose
of
having
the
route
available
would
be
in
the
event
of
some
emergency
and
the
other
witness
made
no
present
claim
for
any
need.
these
states
also
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
union
pacific
provides
the
fastest
and
the
shortest
and
the
most
economical
route
to
the
southern
and
eastern
markets.
now,
they
attempted
to
point
out
and
did
so
successfully
that
the
wastefulness
involved
in
the
longer
and
more
circuitous
route
would
ultimately
have
to
be
borne
by
the
shippers
from
that
area.
we've
learned
up
there
from
other
painful
experience
because
we're
so
far
from
distant
markets
in
the
east
and
the
south
that
were
pretty
much
dependent
for
fast
and
low
cost
transportation.
it's
clear
to
us
that
a
railroad
that
would
propose
to
offer
us
a
longer
route
cannot
and
will
not
be
able
to
provide
more
adequate
or
economic
service.
yet
the
commission
--
mr.
robert
l.
simpson
now,
they
were
--
mr.
robert
l.
simpson
our
state
commission,
justice
douglas,
presented
testimony
in
opposition
to
the
route
and
presented
testimony
showing
that
the
union
pacific
route
was
the
shortest
and
the
fastest
and
the
most
economical
route.
mr.
robert
l.
simpson
the
diversion
which
must
of
course
result
from
approving
the
proposal
of
the
rio
grande
means
that
shippers
for
one
thing,
who
are
not
informed
about
transportation
matters
and
are
part
of
the
country
particularly
those
in
the
east,
they
won't
necessarily
have
the
control
over
the
shipments
and
even
though
there
is
no
compulsion
to
use
the
route
of
the
rio
grande,
assuming
its
proposals
are
accepted,
nevertheless,
because
these
shippers
are
not
convergent
with
transportation
facilities
and
routes
in
our
part
of
the
country,
not
having
this
control,
that
traffic,
nevertheless,
can
be
diverted
to
the
longer
lines
of
the
rio
grande.
if
there
is
diversion
which
there
unquestionably
will
be,
if
the
proposal
of
the
rio
grande
is
sustained,
that
means
of
course
a
resulting
loss
of
revenue
to
the
carrier,
to
up.
any
loss
of
revenue,
of
course,
must
be
made
up
someway
either
by
effectuating
economies
which
ultimately
will
result
in
effecting
the
party
and
the
degree
of
service
in
our
part
of
the
country
or
could
very
possibly
result
in
an
increase
in
the
level
of
rates.
and
we're
not
very
favorably
impressed
of
--
in
our
part
of
the
country
as
to
increase
rates
because
of
the
disadvantage
we
now
have
because
of
our
distance
from
these
markets.
i
hope
by
now
we
have
explained
somehow
the
feeling
that
generated
our
commission
and
the
shippers
in
our
area
to
oppose
this
complaint.
mr.
robert
l.
simpson
if
it
would
result
in
--
mr.
robert
l.
simpson
that's
right
mr.
justice,
if
it
would
adversely
affect
the
existing
transportation
facilities
in
our
state.
mr.
robert
l.
simpson
unquestionably.
that's
the
only
reason
i
am
here.
mr.
robert
l.
simpson
both
ways,
your
honor,
because
particularly
the
producers
and
the
shippers
in
the
east
that
are
less
converging
with
the
traffic
conditions
in
the
pacific
coast
than
our
own
shippers.
our
own
shippers
won't
be
using
the
rio
grande.
mr.
robert
l.
simpson
that's
absolutely
correct.
one
more
point
before
i
close.
the
commission
sought
to
justify
its
report
or
order
by
saying
that
producers
and
shippers
in
the
pacific
northwest
are
entitled
to
have
their
products
moved
with
expedition
to
as
many
markets
as
possible
in
over
as
many
routes.
and
they
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
shippers
in
the
pacific
northwest
are
debarred
or
excluded
as
the
map
will
show.
the
incredible
thing
to
us
is
that
the
commission
was
capable
of
indulging
in
such
language
when
there
was
a
single
shipper
who
even
made
such
a
statement,
let
alone
was
there
a
single
shipper
from
the
state
of
washington
who
even
testified
on
behalf
of
the
rio
grande.
it's
particularly
alarming
to
me
as
a
lawyer
that
this
administrative
agency
would
choose
to
ignore
the
voluminous
testimony
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
pacific
northwest.
i
hope
i
can
leave
with
you
the
impression
that
this
record
is
devoid
of
any
need
for
the
proposed
routes
of
the
rio
grande.
thank
you
very
much.
