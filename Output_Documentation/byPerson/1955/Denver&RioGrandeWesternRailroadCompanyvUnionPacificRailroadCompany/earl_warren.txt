mr.
collins,
could
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you
have
three
minutes
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
collins,
perhaps
you'd
like
to
--
to
give
us
some
memorandum
on
the
history
of
--
of
this
matter
and
if
you
will
do
that,
mr.
holman,
you
may
have
an
opportunity
to
answer
if
you
wish
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
just
as
you
please.
if
you
wish
to
do
it,
you
may.
if
you
don't,
why
--
you
don't
need
to.
now,
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
refer
to
another
matter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yesterday,
i
asked
you
about
the
question
of
adequacy
and
what
the
language
of
the
commission
was
in
finding
that
the
facilities
of
the
union
pacific
were
adequate.
and
you
referred
me
to
that
portion
of
the
report
of
the
commission
which
is
entitled,
"opposition
testimony"
in
which
it
said
its
present
facilities
are
adequate
to
move
over
its
own
direct
routes,
the
present
volume
of
traffic
in
any
additional
volume
that
may
be
anticipated
in
the
foreseeable
future.
now,
today,
mr.
holman
points
out
to
us,
under
the
heading
“general
discussion
and
ultimate
fact
findings,”
the
following
language,
"while
the
true
service
over
defendant's
routes
in
general
is
as
satisfactory
to
the
shipping
public
as
the
service
which
could
be
provided
over
routes
including
the
rio
grande
via
ogden
or
salt
lake
city,
this
is
not
true
with
respect
to
the
commodities
we
have
enumerated."
then
jumping
to
the
latter
sentence
of
that
same
paragraph,
it
says,
"on
such
traffic,
the
defendant's
routes
are
inadequate
unless
economical
and
are
the
rio
grande
routes."
now,
would
you
explain
the
difference
between
those
two
and
which
is
binding
on
us
--
binding
on
us
insofar
as
the
question
of
adequacy
is
concerned.
