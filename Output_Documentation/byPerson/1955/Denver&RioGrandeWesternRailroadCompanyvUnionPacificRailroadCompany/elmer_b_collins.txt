mr.
elmer
b.
collins
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
it
won't
disturb
your
honors
on
their
--
their
readjusting
here
so
that
you
can
have
the
advantage
if
you
look
at
my
map.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
you
might
say
that
in
view
of
the
shortness
of
time,
i
will
discuss
such
points
as
i
--
as
i
can
and
pray
that
the
court
will
consider
the
points
on
brief
that
i'm
unable
to
discuss
during
the
time
that
i
have.
we
have
divided
our
time
as
i
told
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
i
presume
the
chief
justice
has
the
division
between
the
union
pacific
northern
railroad,
the
attorney
general
of
colorado
or
rather
of
washington
and
the
attorney
general
of
nebraska
or
their
assistants.
now,
if
i
could
persuade
your
honors
to
forget
the
smog
and
confusion
in
which
the
rio
grande
has
attempted
to
disguise
it's
case
and
let
me
tell
you
that
the
case
as
we
see
it
and
we
think
and
appeal
it
in
this
area
here
which
we
cross-hatched
in
green.
i
hope
your
honors
can
see
it.
in
fact,
if
there's
a
doubt
in
which
we
could,
but
it's
what's
called
the
northwest
area
or
as
they
choose
to
call
it
“closed
door”
area.
there
is
--
originate
and
terminate
about
172,000
cargoes
of
freight
a
year.
it
moves
eastward,
it
points
in
eastward,
mostly
east
of
the
missouri
--
mississippi
river
and
north
of
the
ohio
river
and
the
westbound
traffic
originating
mostly
in
that
eastern
area
and
a
little
bit
in
the
south
moves
westward
over
the
northern
lines
up
here,
the
great
northern
milwaukee
and
northern
pacific
are
all
in
the
union
pacific
routes
which
are
shown
on
this
map
in
red.
the
rio
grande
route
is
shown
between
ogden
and
denver
and
the
broken
flat
line
and
it
is
that
172,000
cars
that
move
over
these
routes
which
the
commission
found
these
as
much
as
50%
shorter
than
routes
or
some
routes
that
would
be
made
over
the
rio
grande.
and
actually,
the
movement
over
the
rio
grande
from
this
point
where
we
start
east
from
pocatello
direct
through
cheyenne,
if
the
traffic
was
--
had
to
be
moved
down
to
ogden
and
there
given
to
the
rio
grande,
it
would
take
219
more
miles
of
transportation
work
to
get
it
to
omaha
and
199
more
miles
to
get
the
same
shipment
to
omaha
on
its
way
to
its
ultimate
destination.
you
understand
that
that
the
traffic
moved
between
the
northwest
area
and
the
area
east
of
the
mississippi
river
and
all
the
rio
grande
ones
is
the
substitute
or
part
of
its
line
for
the
lines
on
which
the
traffic
originates
and
terminates
and
the
president
of
the
rio
grand
railroad
said
it's
--
it's
sole
purpose
was
to
improve
its
financial
position
by
taking
a
bridge
haul
out
of
this
traffic
that
goes
from
the
--
moves
between
the
west
coast
and
the
east
coast.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
that
pierce
the
dilemma,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
see
how
you're
ever
going
to
give
effect
to
that
financial
needs
prohibition
of
section
15
(4)
if
the
commission
is
going
to
say,
“well
we
didn't
consider
it.”
i
--
i
don't
know
what
--
what
circumstances
there
could
be
if
--
under
which
the
commission
would
confess
that
it
had
considered
financial
needs
of
a
railroad
in
--
in
the
face
of
the
statute
that
would
tell
him
even
without
going
to
court
that
you're
making
a
void
order.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
yes,
it
is,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
i'll
help
you
out.
the
commission's
report
is
replete
with
everything
that
would
lead
up
to
saying,
“well,
we
--we
are
unable
to
make
an
order
here
because
you
say
you
want
to
improve
your
financial
position
and
we
are
prohibited
from
granting
an
order
for
that
purpose.”
all
through
the
commission's
report,
there
is
emphasis,
reemphasis
and
reiteration
of
the
importance
of
bridge
traffic
to
the
rio
grande
railroad
and
the
recital
of
its
bankrupt
condition
which
finally
--
which
ended
in
1947.
the
--
the
financial
importance
of
bridge
traffic
to
the
rio
grande
runs
all
through
the
report
until
they
get
up
to
the
final
point
of
--
of
discussion
and
trying
to
arrive
at
a
decision,
they
point
out
that
the
rio
grande
increased
it
state
of
traffic
from
other
routes
for
a
bridge
haul,
326%
in
the
15
years
before
it
filed
its
complaint
and
the
rio
grande
said
that
we
can't
live
without
taking
money
from
or
rather
taking
traffic
in
revenues
from
other
carriers
which
we
neither
originate
and
--
or
nor
terminate
and
it's
the
traffic
in
which
there's
generally
conceded
to
be
the
greatest
amount
of
net
money
because
you
don't
have
the
expensive
gathering
and
delivering
expenses.
so
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
sir.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
that's
correct,
its
president
so
testified.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
no.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
would
not
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
the
commission
could
not
make
an
order,
diverting
traffic
from
existing
through
routes
to
a
new
proposed
route
if
--
just
because,
i
say
it
would
not
be
prevented
by
the
mere
incident
that
it
might
result
in
some
enhancement
of
that
railroad's
position.
but
when
a
railroad
like
the
rio
grande
that
has
been
bankrupt
throughout
most
of
its
career,
unfortunately,
and
has
been
trimming
of
its
branch
lines
abandoning
them
in
order
to
work
as
what
it
calls
a
bridge
line
and
then
comes
to
the
commission
in
its
non
early
mercenary
position
and
i
--
i
think
we
should
consider
the
fact
that
it's
out
for
the
money
and
the
only
way
to
get
it
is
from
the
carriers
that
originate
and
terminate
the
traffic
and
are
hauling
it
between
the
termini
of
the
existing
through
routes.
you
--
i
don't
think
that
you
have
in
this
case
what
you
could
easily
imagine
you
would
have
in
a
case
brought
by
shippers
who
wanted
better
transportation
to
result
from
the
proposed
through
routes.
you
don't
have
that
situation
here.
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
rio
grande
stood
by
and
it
finally
build
up
its
line,
as
its
president
testified
through
the
period
of
--
of
its
last
bankruptcy,
until
they
reached
the
points,
they
said,
“well,
now
we
think
we
can
compete
for
this
traffic
so
we'll
try
to
cut
in
on
it
and
we'll
bring
a
complaint.”
they
went
out
and
as
they
admit,
they
solicited
a
lot
of
shippers
to
come
and
help
them
out
to
win
the
case
and
brought
them
in
and
mr.
holman
was
speaking
for
them
just
now,
so,
he
said.
so,
the
rio
grande
i
think
was
cognizant
of
all
these
difficulties
that
stood
in
its
way
and
tried
to
disguise
its
complaint
or
at
least
ride
through
the
commission
on
a
public
interest
complaint,
but
its
own
financial
interest
and
its
financial
gain
cannot
be
forgotten.
now,
i
think
you've
--
you've
had
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
your
honor,
the
commission,
although
accepting
the
invitation
presented
in
the
rio
grande's
confused
complaint
which
alleged
violations
of
about
every
section
of
the
act
that
it
thought
could
have
any
application
to
anybody.
commission
accommodated
it
with
findings
but
went
ahead
and
said
explicitly,
"any
order
giving
the
rio
grande
railroad
what
it
wants
in
this
case
will
have
to
be
based
on
clause
(b)
exception
to
the
short-haul
provision
of
section
15
(4)."
so
that
in
the
--
in
numerous
cases
which
this
court
has
rendered
decisions
wholly,
that
where
the
commission
has
explicitly
adopted
a
legal
basis
and
--
and
puts
its
order
on
that
basis,
you'll
the
test
the
validity
of
the
order
on
that
basis
and
not
on
something
else.
now
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
we
--
you
--
we're
not
trying
to
sustain
it?
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
mr.
justice,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
to
have
to
say
this
but
i
--
i've
been
trying
for
seven
years
to
find
out
on
what
section
of
the
act
they
specifically
put
any
claim
of
theirs.
i
don't
know
what
they've
been
doing.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
court
in
nebraska
did
this,
if
understand
his
opinion
correctly,
it
said
there
can
be
no
section
3
paragraph
one
violation
here
because
the
shippers
suppose
to
be
preferred
are
located
on
one
railroad
and
those
supposed
to
be
prejudiced
are
on
the
other.
and
then
they
said,
the
evidence
--
after
putting
that
aside
they
said
the
evidence
will
not
support
a
finding,
the
commission's
finding
that
service
by
the
--
over
the
union
pacific
routes
or
this
traffic
that
moves
over
the
union
pacific,
no
evidence
will
support
a
finding
that
that
service
is
inadequate
because
the
commission
had
found
that
to
the
adequate,
the
route
shorter,
the
time
in-transit
24
hours
at
least
in
two,
the
change
is
shorter
and
very
sensibly
it
seems
to
me
the
court
says,
“you
can't
--
you
can't
have
inadequacy
of
transportation
and
--
of
traffic
that
actually
moves
over
the
union
pacific,”
and
consequently,
you
can't
condemn
those
routes
under
section
15
(4),
so
as
to
reach
it
under
clause
(b).
you
have
no
necessity
to
invoke
clause
(b)
on
that
traffic.
but
then
the
court
did
this
strangest
thing,
it
turn
around
and
said,
"there
is
evidence
that
will
support
a
finding,"
although
the
commission
didn't
make
the
finding.
the
court
said,
“the
service
by
a
way
of
the
rio
grande
having
its
higher
rates
and
its
longer
route
and
so
forth
is
inadequate
and
also
inefficient
and
uneconomical.”
i
think
the
commission's
report
was
in
such
a
confused
state
that
it
got
the
nebraska
court
confused.
i
should
say
that
the
commission
held
that
it
could
not
order
the
--
any
of
the
relief
the
rio
grande
wanted
unless
it
first
condemned
existing
routes.
and
undoubtedly,
if
adequacy
is
to
be
tested
by
anything,
i
mean,
adequacy
of
transportation
which
is
the
standard
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
this
is
to
be
tested
by
anything.
it
must
be
by
the
type
service
that
the
existing
routes
conformed.
so,
the
--
the
commission
and
then
these
shorter
routes,
with
a
shorter
time,
adequate
the
commission
properly
held
to
or
any
foreseeable
volume
of
this
traffic
from
the
northwest
area
to
the
east
and
from
the
east
to
the
west
without
going
over
this
mountainous
road
which
the
commission
found
in
the
rio
grande,
to
be
longer,
slower,
less
favorably
situated
and
with
the
most
onerous
operating
conditions
of
any
of
the
western
lines
named
in
its
complaint.
but
the
commission
and
its
desperation
to
find
the
ground
on
which
to
condemn
the
union
pacific
routes
and
divert
some
of
the
traffic
to
the
rio
grande
said
that
our
routes
were
inadequate
because
at
points
on
the
rio
grande
they
are
not
available
and
higher
rate
supply.
in
other
words,
the
union
pacific
routes
and
for
that
i
refer
to
all
the
routes
that
have
a
joint
rate
as
we
go
through
the
northern
lands,
we
are
condemned
and
to
be
short-haul
because
we
don't
serve
territory
or
stations
that
is
located
400
or
500
miles
or
several
hundred
miles
south
of
us
through
the
rocky
mountains.
now,
this
court
have
such
a
case
before
it,
in
the
very
first
one
that
came
here
involving
a
shorter
haul
ordered
by
the
commission
after
it
got
the
power
to
compel
through
routes
and
joint
rates.
it's
interstate
commerce
commission
against
the
northern
pacific
railroad
and
it's
cited
in
our
brief
and
it's
216
u.s.
in
which
the
commission
being
anxious
to
have
as
many
routes
as
possible
and
that
was,
and
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute
was
one
of
its
mysterious
here.
the
commission
said
that
it
issued
an
order
telling
the
northern
pacific
railroad
on
traffic
to
seattle
to
join
with
the
union
pacific
routes
from
portland
or
the
union
pacific
had
no
route
then
from
portland
to
seattle,
join
with
the
other
carriers
from
portland
to
seattle
to
get
a
through
route
over
this
longer
area
to
seattle,
then
over
the
northern
pacific
at
that
time,
the
statutes
said
that
the
commission
may
make
through
routes
and
joint
rates
if
no
reasonable
--
no
reasonably
satisfactory
route
exist.
well,
the
commission
pointed
out
that
these
people
like
to
go
through
salt
lake
city
and
they'd
like
to
see
different
territory
going
one
route
and
coming
back
another.
but
yet,
it
said
that
the
northern
pacific
route
was
about
equidistance,
it
had
this
good
service
and
all
of
that.
well,
this
court
said
that,
“well,
that
might
be
a
reason
for
a
preference,
it's
not
a
reason
for
condemning
the
existing
routes
and
you
can't
short-haul
it
on
that
theory.”
this
--
this
is
just
a
repetition
of
that.
now,
i
intended
to
--
to
tell
you
some
more
of
the
weird
things
which
the
commission
did.
it
proposes
the
short-haul,
the
shorter,
faster,
adequate,
direct
lines
by
adding
a
longer,
more
onerous
and
slower
line.
on
those
facts,
it
is
my
contention
that
the
commission
cannot
at
anytime
make
an
order,
short-hauling,
the
existing
routes,
so
long
as
those
facts,
as
to
those
other
facts
and
there
so
found
by
the
commission
are
not
disputed.
they
can't
dispute
the
physical
and
geographical
situation.
the
commission
next
misconstrued
it's
authority
under
this
clause
(b)
which,
i
might
say,
authorizes
that
the
short-haul
existing
routes
is
the
--
if
the
commission
finds
that
the
proposed
through
route
is
needed
to
provide
adequate
and
the
more
efficient
or
more
economic
transportation.
now,
the
commission
says,
“well,
the
union
pacific
provides
transportation
services
that
are
as
--
as
good
as
any
of
the
rio
grande
could,”
but
the
shippers'
testimony
suggest
a
need
for
more
adequate
transportation.
i
--
i
suggest
to
your
honors
if
we're
to
add
a
limitless
word
like
“more”
in
front
of
the
quote
--
phrase,
more
adequate
and
more
efficient,
why
then,
the
commission
has
found
a
way
completely
around
the
--
or
the
interpretation
that
it
puts
on
clause
(b)
because
every
route
it
adds
that
could
say
would
make
it
more
adequate.
then
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
where's
the
--
perhaps
the
--
brief
at
page
25
of
the
--
of
the
brief
in
the
nebraska
record,
number
117,
118
and
119
and
you'll
find
the
beginning
of
the
commission's
report.
and
at
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
beg
your
pardon?
this
--
well,
the
--
the
record
of
the
same
colors,
transcript
of
record
in
numbers
117,
118
and
119,
that's
from
the
nebraska
court.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
oh,
25,
that's
where
the
commission's
report
begins.
i
mean,
to
read
the
number,
there's
a
way
the
clerk
read
them,
but
it
now
--
i'll
find
you
in
just
a
moment.
where
you
find
that
number,
it
serves
a
--
at
--
under
the
--
the
discussion,
under
the
nebraska
record,
page
61,
beginning,
opposition
testimony
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
you'd
see
a
discussion
of
the
union
pacific's
testimony.
and
at
the
top
of
--
of
page
62
as
numbered
--
three-numbered,
i
mean
that's
the
record
number,
there
are
other
pages,
the
commission
report
number.
where
it
says
the
union
pacific
has
over
$600
million
invested
in
the
routes
concerned,
its
present
facilities
are
adequate
to
move
over
its
own
direct
routes.
the
present
volume
of
traffic
and
any
additional
volume
that
maybe
anticipated
in
the
foreseeable
future
and
then
it
goes
on
to
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
can't
imagine
what
else
it
could
be,
sir.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
it
doesn't
say
that
we
claim
this
for
our
facilities.
it
says
that
they
are
adequate
to
move
over
these
routes,
any
amount
of
traffic
from
--
from
the
foreseeable
future.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
it's
a
finding,
if
the
commission
is
capable
of
making
one.
it's
--
it's
the
commission's
taking
out
of
its
own
brain
and
putting
on
paper
what
it
finds
from
the
testimony
that
we
put
in
the
records.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
think
every
--
every
justice
of
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
--
commission's
habit
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
--
of
making
a
series
of
what
you
referred
to
as
--
as
basic
findings
before
they
reach
the
ultimate
conclusions,
but
they're
finally
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i'm
sorry,
but
that's
the
case
and
every
report
of
the
commission
as
i
read
for
30
years.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
i
might
have
been
if
i
hadn't
left
them.
you
will
find
the
conclusions
and
the
--
at
the
page
73
of
that
record
and
you'll
find
general
discussion
and
ultimate
findings
of
fact
beginning
at
page
67.
and
there,
they
--
they
--
we
might
say
edge
up
toward
the
thing
they
finally
say
and
that
is
that
it's
--
it's
in
the
public
interest,
(inaudible)
and
desirable
in
the
public
interest
to
have
that
the
--
and
mind
you,
this
is
their
finding
and
this
is
another
important
contention,
at
least
i
think
it's
important,
that
i
make
on
behalf
of
the
railroads
in
attacking
the
commission's
order.
we
say
the
whole
order,
the
only
order
they
issued
should
be
enjoined
and
annulled,
for
reasons
that
i
have
indicated
up
to
now.
but
when
it
came
to
the
ultimate
finding,
the
commission
said
and
we
find
that
it
is
necessary
and
desirable
in
the
public
interest
which
is
the
--
which
is
the
language
of
paragraph
3
of
section
15
of
the
act
which
chief
justice
vincent
said
in
the
thompson
case
in
243
u.s.
in
june
1952,
is
the
general
language
of
the
act
where
no
short-hauling
is
involved.
the
commission
then
went
on,
have
to
say
it's
necessary
and
desirable
in
the
public
interest
that
these
through
routes
and
joint
rates
be
required
by
the
rio
grande
or
these
commodities.
to
--
i
don't
understand
this
lighting
system,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
mean
my
times
is
--
is
--
my
30
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
oh.
well,
i
just
going
to
take
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
the
lights
went
on
and
i
didn't
know
what
it
meant.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
all
right.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
okay.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
oh,
okay.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
it's
all
right,
thank
you,
sir.
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
understand.
but
instead
of
making
the
findings
required
by
clause
(b)
of
which
the
commission
said
explicitly
that
it
revoke
--
that
it
invoked
and
was
making
the
basis
of
its
order,
said
the
shippers'
testimony,
indicated
the
need
for
more
adequate
transportation.
it
did
not
find
that
the
routes
by
way
of
the
rio
grande
were
needed
and
this
court,
mr.
justice
black
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
against
the
united
states
in
323
u.s.
specifically
of
clause
(b)
said
that
the
word
needed
in
clause
(b)
was
not
redundant
of
or
with
the
general
language
in
section
15
paragraph
3,
that
congress
had
a
purpose
in
using
these
other
and
different
words
in
clause
(b).
so,
the
commission
did
not
find
the
rio
grande
route
was
needed.
it
did
not
find
that
the
route
would
provide
more
efficient
transportation
and
that
is
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
qualities
of
transportation
which
this
court
has
said
ever
since
the
transportation
act
1920
was
one
of
the
basic
concerns
of
congress.
that
is
efficiency
as
well
as
adequacy
of
transportation.
then
the
commission
said
or
found
that
the
rio
grande
route
was
necessary
to
provide
more
economic
routes,
more
economic
transportation
and
i
submit
to
you
that
all
that
means
is
that
the
commission
has
misjudged
the
statutory
pattern
because
what
it
is
done
is
to
reduce
the
rio
grande
rates
from
the
combination
level
down
to
equalized
them
with
union
pacific
route
rates
and
that
isn't
what
the
statute
means.
it
means
that
this
proposed
route
over
here
was
have
merits
of
its
own
which
will
give
the
public
adequate,
more
efficient
and
more
economic
transportation
what
the
--
which
the
existing
routes
can't
give.
it
doesn't
give
the
commission
authority
to
simply
substitute
the
joint
rates
for
the
combination
rates
and
then
sit
back
and
say,
“well
now,
transportation
is
more
economic
and
the
routes
are
justified
because
it's
obvious
that
ordering
rates
over
the
rio
grande
equal
to
those
already
in
existence
over
the
union
pacific
for
many
years,”
does
not
provide
for
the
shipper
anymore
economic
transportation
than
he
has
and
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
possibility
of
anybody
justifying
the
--
the
economy,
as
we
know
economy
that
is
a
standpoint
of
which
can
be
done
with
the
least
effort
and
the
least
expense
in
transporting
over
the
rio
grande
as
in
transporting
over
the
union
pacific
because
you've
got,
let's
say
219
miles
of
additional
transportation
over
the
most
onerous
operating
miles
in
the
country,
a
pure
economic
waste
there.
so,
none
of
the
--
the
essential
findings
were
made
by
the
commission
even
to
justify
clause
(b),
then
it
departed
not
only
from
that
finding,
which
it
had
been
invoked.
it
adopted
the
new
one
of
all
possible
routes
for
perishable
products
and
if
that
is
to
be
done,
then
everytime
the
commission
says
a
segment
of
traffic
in
its
judgment
needs
all
possible
routes,
then
reasonable
through
routes,
a
standard
of
the
act
and
adequacy
of
transportation,
as
circuit
judge
johnsens
says,
"the
carriers
might
as
well
forget
any
possible
protection
under
the
short-haul
prohibition
of
the
act."
then,
not
only
did
the
commission
substituted
its
own
standard
for
the
statutory
standard,
after
finding
itself
unable
to
make
the
findings
required
by
clause
(b),
but
of
all
things,
seizing
upon
perishable
products
as
is
its
justification
for
short-hauling
the
existing
routes,
turn
around
and
put
ordinary
livestock
in
there
with
--
within
the
classification
of
perishable
food
products,
not
being
satisfied
to
that
it
tossed
in
dried
beans
within
that
classification
and
that
not
being
enough,
they
put
it
in
westbound
marble
and
granite
tombstones
from
georgia
and
vermont.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
why,
they
get
slabs
of
this
stone,
mr.
justice
burton,
as
i
understand
it.
they
are
(inaudible)
down
to
some
suggested
sizes
and
then
--
or
maybe
pretty
well-furnished
and
polished
off
and
they
--
they're
delivered
to
a
fabricator
at
brigham
city,
utah
and
if
i
happen
to
be
the
--
if
my
folks
happen
to
be
the
purchaser
of
its
product
where
they
carved
my
name
on
it,
that's
called
a
fabrication
in-transit.
they
put
that
then
over
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
it
could
be
in-transit,
that's
right.
it
--
they
could
stock
it
long
enough
to
do
this
finishing
and
put
the
printed
matter
on
it.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
oh,
yes,
yes.
stop,
depart,
we
unload.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
that's
right,
that's
right.
so,
they
can
get
a
monument
wrapped
off
at
carload
rate.
well,
i
--
i
hope
that
--
i
was
understood
when
i
mentioned
these
things.
the
commission
first
did
not
make
the
findings
and
did
not
adhere
to
clause
(b)
which
it
explicitly
invoked
and
on
which
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court,
you
will
adjudge
the
validity
of
the
order
it
issued.
it
adopted
the
standard
of
perishable
food
products
as
required
in
the
marketing
system,
requiring
all
possible
routes
for
that
and
then
couldn't
even
stick
by
the
standard
that
it
has
been
invented
and
adopted
as
its
own,
it
went
out
and
dragged
in
ordinary
livestock,
dried
beans
and
indestructible
marble
and
granite
tombstones.
now,
if
this
--
if
this
order
of
the
commission
can
be
sustained,
then
as
circuit
judge
johnsen
truly
says,
"we
might
as
well
forget
the
thought
of
any
protection
of
a
long-haul"
which
this
court
said
in
the
thompson
case,
was
guaranteed
by
section
15
(4)
of
the
act
subject
to
these
exceptions.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
the
--
the
rio
grande
seems
to
confine
it
to
--
to
satisfy
itself
with
the
--
with
some
theory
that
--
that
the
union
pacific
or
other
railroads
can
--
can
violate
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
require
us
to
take
the
shipment
when
intended.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
paragraph
11
of
section
20,
sir.
it's
known
as
the
bills
of
lading
act,
when
the
shipment
is
--
is
tendered
us
or
traffic
is
received
we
must
take
it
and
issue
a
bill
of
lading.
now,
they
tell
us,
the
way
to
have
avoided
this
was
to
put
in
the
tariff
or
notice
that
we
are
not
going
to
accept
your
shipments
and
then
we
would
not
have
to
issue
a
bill
of
lading
and
by
violating
the
bills
of
lading
act,
we
could
gain
protection
of
our
long-haul
under
section
15
(4).
i
--
i
know
of
no
law
and
i
have
cited
a
lot
of
decisions
in
the
railroads
briefs
which
hold
that
we
cannot,
by
any
publication
in
the
tariff
or
by
any
self-serving
declaration
escape
any
of
our
obligations
as
a
common
carrier.
my
associates
we're
going
to
say
some
things
to
you
and
i
thank
you.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
if
it
please
the
court.
you
might
known
right
now
but
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i'd
like
to
suggest
first
of
all
that
this
--
all
this
talk
about
whether
or
not
through
routes
and
joint
rates
were
in
existence
by
the
rio
grande
is
wasted,
if
it
ever
amounted
to
this
thing.
it
became
moot
when
the
commission
knocked
that
off
the
ground
in
a
way
by
saying
that
the
routes
are
necessary
in
the
public
interest,
but
next
to
what
extent?
to
the
extent
that
joint
rates
are
necessary
on
particular
a
commodity.
they
have
as
to
whether
or
not
through
routes
existed
has
been
played
up
by
the
rio
grande
in
an
effort
to
get
this
case
back
to
the
commission
and
get
a
fresh
start
and
see
if
they
can
--
better
--
better
order
than
they've
had.
the
commission
said
the
rates
--
the
routes
are
needed,
of
course,
they
can
brush
a
short-haul
prohibition
aside
just
for
the
use
of
the
words
then
they
could
say
as
it
is.
the
next
step,
to
what
extent
are
the
--
they
wouldn't
argue
and
come
to
discover
on
everything
--
every
commodity
in
tariff.
they
said
they'll
need
it
on
these
commodities,
the
perishable
commodities
because
we
think
that
perishable
commodities
need
every
possible
route
thus
going
far
beyond
in
the
statutory
(inaudible)
then
as
i
said,
the
court
yesterday,
they
reached
out
and
brought
in
dried
beans
and
livestock
under
that
tent
and
then
that
not
being
enough
brought
in
the
westbound
tombstone.
now,
may
i
say
to
the
court
that
their
effort
to
the
efforts
of
counsel
for
the
rio
grande
suggest
that
there's
confusion
in
the
thompson
case
is
futile
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
thompson
made
it
definitely
clear
that
the
publication
by
each
--
each
railroad
that
connects
it
with
the
next
one
of
its
local
joint
rate
did
not
result
in
the
establishment
of
through
routes
and
we
get
upon
the
point
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
touching
awhile
ago
that
if
that
would
be
so
then
the
through
routes
power
given
to
the
commission
in
1906,
19
years
after
the
original
act
required
the
publication
of
local
rates
by
each
carrier,
is
all
a
futile
gesture
and
unnecessary
surplus.
and
the
idea
that
the
union
pacific,
by
not
making
some
note
in
its
tariff
or
tariffs,
saying
that
the
route
is
close
as
i
have
said
to
you
yesterday
and
i
point
to
discussion
in
page
--
of
the
railroads
brief
in
number
333,
the
colorado
case,
page
76.
i've
cited
cases
there
which
said
--
say
that
we
can't
put
any
kind
of
a
--
of
a
wording
in
a
tariff,
it
will
--
will
prevent
us
from
carrying
out
a
statutory
duty.
they
might
as
well
say
that
we'll
publish
another
so
we
won't
pay
our
income
tax
because
the
duty
is
just
as
binding
on
us
to
act
as
a
common
carrier,
to
accept
shipments
when
they're
offered
at
whatever
rate
is
published.
we're
compelled
to
publish
rates
and
to
accept
shipments
and
all
of
these
--
these
pathetic
talk
about
our
having
never
put
a
roadblock
or
torn
up
the
tracks
or
having
published
the
futile
note
in
the
tariffs
saying
the
route
is
closed
is
without
the
--
the
slightest
substance
and
nothing
but
an
effort
to
get
this
case
back
to
the
commission
to
take
a
fresh
start
for
seven
more
years
of
this
onerous
litigation.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
you
--
your
honor,
you
have
--
you
have
to
give
in
--
the
tariff
publishes
a
little
more
credit
than
they
deserve,
but
i'd
like
to
give
as
the
language.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
tariffs
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
that
we
were
on
trial
before
the
commission.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
tariffs
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
we
were
on
trial
before
the
commission.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
yes.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
no,
i
don't
understand
that
he
asked
me
about
the
tariffs
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
cancellation
back
in
1976.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
eastbound
rates
and
here's
the
tariff,
eastbound
rates
from
points
subject
to
the
western
gateway's
name
herein
do
not
apply
on
traffic
delivered
by
the
union
pacific
to
connecting
lines
at
junction
points
in
the
state
of
utah.
that's
the
rio
grande
railroad.
that's
meant
that
the
lower
joint
rate
would
not
apply
on
traffic
delivery.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
that's
all
as
to
eastbound
traffic.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
same
thing
for
westbound
traffic.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
can't
be
sure
of
that.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
we
will
trace
our
tariff
history
back
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
--
as
far
as
we
can
if
you're
interested
in
it.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
we
--
we
don't
have
in
this
record
the
tariffs
that
were
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
no,
i
didn't
say
anything
about
the
two
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
your
honor,
it
doesn't
mean
what's
in
the
record.
i
think
we're
confined
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
tariffs
were
put
into
the
record.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
we
have
never
contended
that
we
said
anything
about
through
routes,
but
let
me
--
let
me
suggest
that
you
look
at
the
--
at
the
cases
i've
cited,
proceedings
that
took
place
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
at
the
time
that
some
of
these
old
rates
were
canceled.
i
have
pointed
at
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
--
i
have
the
railroads
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
union
specific
in
one
--
number
333,
where
i
show
that
in
three
to
four
of
those
old
proceedings
that
took
place
at
the
time
those
rates
were
canceled,
the
commission
said
the
union
pacific
offers
tariffs
opposing
to
cancel
through
routes
and
joint
rates.
and
the
discussion,
all
the
way
through,
showed
that
the
commission
thought
it
was
canceling
the
through
routes
as
well
as
the
joint
rates
and
nobody
ever
had
any
such
thought
as
you
now
hear
it
thence
until
the
right
man
dug
it
up
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
--
i
don't
see
it
admittedly
but
one
of
them
was
--
was
the
ogden
gateway
case
and
maybe
i'm
looking
the
wrong
brief
and
two
or
three
others
there
which
repeat
that
the
commission
was
canceling
through
routes
to
the
extent
that
authorized
the
tariffs
as
well
as
joint
rates.
now,
that's
the
language
it
used
and
that's
what
at
all
it
was
doing
50
years
ago.
they
come
to
you
now
and
tell
you
they
didn't
do
it.
we've
got
a
new
theory
about
it
so
the
result
is
that
the
through
route
have
been
there
all
the
time
but
if
they
held
then
they've
been
there
on
every
railroad
in
this
country,
every
connecting
railroad.
they
were
not
there
for
any
other
reason
according
to
their
argument
except
because
joint
rates
were
published
and
the
lines
physically
connected.
if
that's
so
then
a
joint
rate
is
all
as
--
i
mean
the
through
route
is
forever
there
and
nobody
can
do
anything
about
it.
it's
then
is
a
through
route
under
compulsion
and
the
--
the
whole
statutory
pattern
becomes
distorted.
the
page
that
now
i
had
in
mind,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
63
of
this
light
grey
brief,
number
3333.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
the
brief
--
it's
the
opening
brief
in
the
colorado
case.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
sir?
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
well,
the
union
pacific
and
the
other
seven
railroads
that
joined.
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
your
honor,
i
have
never
seen
a
more
confusing
and
fuzzy
and
puzzling
paragraph
and
inconsistent
piece
of
writing
in
my
life
than
that
--
mr.
elmer
b.
collins
--
paragraph.
now,
they
say
first
that
the
union
pacific
routes
can
make
it
in
at
least
24
hours
shorter
time.
for
traffic,
this
traffic
moves,
mind
you,
from
the
northwest
to
atlantic
city
in
new
york.
the
question
is
getting
it
from
the
west
origin
to
the
east
in
termini.
and
yet
they
say
it
is
not
true
that
we
can
do
all
that,
haul
perishable
goods.
and
why
can't
we?
they
don't
explain.
they
don't
tell
us
why
we
can't
haul
perishable
goods
that's
passed
or
pass
at
the
rio
grande.
they
tell
us
that
perishable
goods
need
a
lot
of
transit
services,
after
telling
us
in
the
first
place
that
they
must
travel
with
expedition
and
care.
then
they
tell
us
that
they
must
stop
for
periods
which
under
the
tariff
could
be
as
long
as
12
months.
(inaudible)
privilege
is
what
puts
the
commission
itself
in
this
case
and
this
court
wants
in
the
decision
in
305
u.s.by
mr.
justice
reed,
that
is
a
commercial
operation
and
not
a
transit
--
not
a
transportation
service.
so,
then
next
they
say,
the
shippers
in
the
northwest,
who
now
have
the
union
pacific
routes
and
a
few
of
whom,
20
--
22
of
whom
as
against
73,
the
commission
says
are
debarred.
the
73
denies
that
they're
debarred
and
they
denied
that
they
want
the
long
routes.
they
say
they
are
satisfied
but
the
commission
says
you
were
debarred
no
matter
what
you
say
from
these
markets
in
the
country
because
you
can't
ship
over
the
rio
grande
at
the
same
rate
you
can
over
the
union
pacific
railroad.
they
each
testified
that
they
reached
every
market
in
the
country
in
the
all
48
states
--
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
they
say
we
--
we
ship
our
goods
to
every
state
in
the
48
states
and
to
six
foreign
countries.
now,
that
came
both
from
rio
grande
witnesses
and
witnesses
that
uphold
the
rio
grande.
i
--
i
say
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
commission
has
--
has
so
obviously,
to
me
in
that
paragraph,
contradicted
itself
that
i
see
no
way
to
reconcile
the
--
the
statements
in
it.and
if
the
union
pacific
routes
are
inadequate
because
we
don't
serve
points
that
might
want
to
go
through
a
commercial
operation
called
transit
located
along
the
rio
grande
then
we
are
sunk
indeed
and
so
is
the
rail
--
the
railroad
in
the
country.
