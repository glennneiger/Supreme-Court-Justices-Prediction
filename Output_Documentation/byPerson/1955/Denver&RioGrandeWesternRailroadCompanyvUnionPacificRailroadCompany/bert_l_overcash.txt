mr.
bert
l.
overcash
may
it
please
the
court.
judge
johnsen
in
his
opinion
in
the
omaha
case
characterized
this
proceeding
as
another
attempt
by
the
commission
to
gain
a
new
foothold
under
another
disguise.
i
wish
to
discuss
in
the
few
minutes
of
my
disposal,
the
misuse
by
the
commission
of
the
various
sections
of
the
act
particularly
section
13
(4).
preliminary
to
that,
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
joint
briefs
of
these
states,
emphasizes
in
some
detail
legislative
background
and
legislative
history
of
amendments
to
this
act
that
we
think
are
important.
in
the
colorado
brief,
there
are
--
there
is
reference
to
15
(3)
and
15
(8)
as
to
amendments,
in
the
nebraska
case
15
(4)
and
section
3
(1).
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
may
i
suggest
to
you
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
read
page
56
of
our
nebraska
brief
on
the
matter
of
cancellation
of
terms.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
they're
both
white.
now,
the
mishandling
of
various
provisions
of
the
act
is
an
--
is
an
important
part
of
what
judge
johnsen
describes
as
the
confusion
in
which
this
whole
report
is
wrapped.
this
court
will
appreciate
that
it's
very
difficult
to
explain
confusion,
much
less
rationalize
it.
i
--
i
will
attempt
however
to
at
least
identify
to
the
court
what
we
think
is
the
confusion
in
this
report.
it
begins
all
right
by
referring
to
section
15
(4)
as
a
basis
for
the
order.
and
upon
that
basis
the
report
should
be
considered
as
to
what
it
meets
the
requirements
of
15
(4).
but
the
report
goes
on
and
roams
all
over
the
act
and
ends
up
with
the
finding
of
a
violation
of
section
1
and
section
3
(1).
that
report
denies
and
find
there's
no
violation
of
section
3
(4)
except
as
to
the
local
bamberger
railroad.
now,
we
contend
that
there's
no
support
for
the
findings
of
violation
and
they're
completely
irrelevant.
with
reference
to
section
1,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record,
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
rates
in
support
of
the
finding
that
the
rio
grande's
combination
rates
are
unreasonable
is
a
comparison
of
the
combination
rate
with
the
joint
rate
and
they
say
the
combination
is
higher.
but
this
court
has
said
repeatedly,
the
combination
rates
are
always
higher
and
that
is
wholly
insufficient
evidence
to
support
a
violation
of
section
1.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
length
of
haul
or
various
factors
that
go
into
rate
making,
competition,
the
cost
of
service,
density
or
volume
of
traffic
or
transportation
conditions.
turning
to
section
3
(4),
which
has
mr.
holman
stated,
is
the
only
section
involved
here
in
which
a
carrier
can
make
a
complaint
against
another
carrier.
the
commission
found
no
violation
of
that
section.
no
discrimination
was
established
by
the
rio
grande
against
any
of
the
214
defendant
railroads.
and
the
reason
the
commission
so
held
was
because
there
was
no
showing
of
similarity
of
transportation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
findings
of
the
commission
showed
the
contrary.
now,
this
finding
of
the
commission
on
section
3
(4)
precludes
the
rio
grande
from
maintaining
in
this
action
that
there's
any
violation
to
which
it
can
lay
hold
out.
turning
to
section
--
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
the
omaha
court
eliminated
section
3
(1)
that
i'm
going
to
discuss
and
of
course
there
was
no
violation
of
3
(4).
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
no.
the
majority
and
minority
both
in
the
omaha
case
said
there
was
no
violation
in
section
3.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
there's
a
court
--
well,
the
--
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
the
union
pacific
and
all
the
states
cross-appealed.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
well,
in
all
of
the
points
that
were
adverse
to
us.
but
there
--
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
they
found
a
--
they
affirmed
a
violation
of
section
3
(4),
as
i
remember.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
on
november.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
but
no
other
finding
of
violation.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
i
don't
think
we
cross-appealed
because
we
insisted
there
was
no
violation.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
i
don't
recall
the
specification
of
the
--
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
now,
turning
to
--
turning
to
section
3
(1)
that's
the
shipper
section,
undo
preference
and
prejudice
in
shippers.
the
commission
found
a
violation
of
3
(1).
we
suggest
that
that
was
baseless
for
the
reason
that
that's
a
shipper
section
and
the
railroad
couldn't
invoke
it
and
the
intervention
of
shipper
was
ancillary
to
the
rio
grande's
complaint,
subordination
to
it
and
did
not
broaden
issues
and
establishes
it
as
a
shipper
case.
we
also
point
out
that
there's
--
the
finding
of
dissimilarity
under
section
3
(4)
required
a
similar
finding
under
section
3
(1)
and
there
is
no
basis
for
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
section
3
(1)
in
this
case.
there's
other
reason,
we
urged
the
history
of
the
proviso
of
section
3
(1)
at
page
83
of
our
brief
and
the
--
the
fact
that
there
was
no
showing
in
this
record
of
the
classic
requirements
of
a
shipper
discrimination
case
on
which
you
can
base
a
finding,
the
violation
of
3
(1).
now,
in
that
connection
and
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
shipper
violations,
many
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
rate
disadvantage
that
is
referred
to
here
as
to
processors
and
feeders
on
the
rio
grande
is
compared
with
the
union
pacific
is
a
natural
and
a
proper
relationship.
the
record
shows
without
dispute
that
there's
processors
and
feeders
in
western
nebraska,
wyoming,
and
northeastern
--
northern
colorado,
who
have
the
joint
through
rates
to
the
--
to
idaho
and
these
processors
have
an
advantage
over
the
processors
and
feeders
on
the
rio
grande.
but
the
record
also
shows
that
these
same
processors
and
feeders
in
nebraska,
wyoming,
and
northern
colorado
have
a
disadvantage
with
those
same
processors
when
they
get
their
materials
and
supplies
from
arizona
and
new
mexico.
in
other
words,
the
territory
adjacent
to
wherever
you're
located,
you're
shorter
and
you
have
a
lower
rate
and
that's
a
natural
and
a
proper
application
of
rules
of
rates
and
the
rio
grande
has
an
advantage
on
new
mexico
and
arizona
and
a
disadvantage
on
their
--
farther
territory,
farther
away.
and
they
--
in
this
proceeding
they
want
--
they
want
the
advantage
both
ways.
they
want
all
the
advantages
and
then
of
the
disadvantages.
so,
i
say
to
you
under
3
(1)
factually
there
is
no
case
in
addition
to
the
other
points.
now,
with
reference
to
the
handling
of
these
sections,
i
want
to
emphasis
that.
section
1
and
3
deal
with
the
reasonableness
and
the
equity
of
charges
to
shippers
under
similar
conditions,
section
15
(4)
and
15
(3)
deal
with
an
entirely
different
subject,
that
is
the
adequacy
and
the
efficiency
of
transportation
facilities.
now,
you
can't
create
through
routes
under
section
1
or
3
and
you
can't
reduce
rates
or
equalize
rates,
or
equalize
transit
charges
under
sections
15
(3)
and
(4).
there's
a
direct
remedy
in
these
respective
sections
and
you
can't
give
one
class
of
sections
for
the
purpose
of
remedy
and
matters
in
other
sections.
our
brief
at
page
74
refers
to
a
long
line
of
cases
in
which
the
commissioner
said
that
they
can't
invoke
section
1
in
order
to
avoid
the
requirements
of
section
15
(4).
now,
with
reference
to
the
use
of
section
15
(4)
which
they
apparently
use
here,
the
through
route
section,
the
commission
did
to
cure
violations
of
section
1
and
3.
let
me
specifically
refer
this
court
to
page
100
of
our
nebraska
brief.
we
point
out
there
that
when
the
through
route
section
was
added
to
the
law
in
1906,
it
contained
a
definite
provision
that
section
15
(4)
could
be
used
to
enforce
any
provision
of
the
act
and
then
in
1910
the
congress
eliminated
that
sentence
entirely
from
the
act
and
that
elimination
is
a
direct
indication
and
statement
of
intention
that
section
15
(4)
could
no
longer
be
used
to
enforce
other
provisions
of
the
act.
now,
i
realized
that
there
is
a
provision
in
section
15
(4),
a
parenthetical
sentence
except
as
provided
in
section
3.
but
that
means
if
it
means
anything
that
they
must
have
intended
at
sometime
to
write
some
provisions
into
section
3
with
reference
to
through
routes,
it
can't
be
use
as
a
complete
nullification
of
section
15
(4).
furthermore,
the
meaning
of
that
exception
is
moot
here
because
there's
no
violation
of
section
3
on
this
record.
well,
this
court
in
a
long
line
of
cases
has
held
that
section
15
(4)
cannot
be
subverted
or
nullified
by
any
other
provision
of
the
act.
the
recent
thompson
case
pointed
this
out
that
the
form
of
the
order
couldn't
be
used
to
avoid
the
requirements
of
15
(4).
previous
to
that
in
the
stickell
case,
323
u.s.
this
court
found
a
rate
disadvantage
but
bottomed
the
case
entirely
on
section
15
(4).
in
the
chicago,
i.
and
l.
case,
270
u.s.,
the
opinion
points
out
that
under
the
guise
of
section
3
this
court
will
not
permit
a
through
route
to
be
created
under
section
15.
in
the
central
new
jersey
case,
the
same
holding
was
made
with
reference
to
the
use
of
section
3
by
indirection.
the
saint
louis
southwestern
case
involving
discrimination
against
paducah,
kentucky
carefully
pointed
out
that
in
removing
the
discrimination
this
court
would
not
say
that
any
new
route
had
to
be
created.
so,
we
say
to
the
court
that
you
can't
under
this
legislative
history
and
under
these
decisions
use
15
(4)
as
a
means
of
remedying
what
you
say
or
other
violations
of
the
act.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
oh,
what
i
say
is
that
you
can't
have
a
case
and
say
there's
a
violation
of
section
1
or
3
and
we'll
enforce
in
remedy
that
violation
by
establishing
a
through
route
under
15
(4).
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
i
don't
know
why
that
exception
is
there
and
i
don't
have
any
legislative
history,
but
it's
never
been
construed
your
honor
to
mean
that
you
can
nullify
section
15
(4)
wherever
you
have
a
claim
under
section
3.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
i
--
i
don't
think
you
can,
mr.
justice
reed.
i
--
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
my
own
feeling
is
that
that
language
means
except
as
provided
in
section
3
there
--
there
would
have
to
be
a
provision
in
section
3
with
reference
to
through
routes
before
that
section
would
come
into
play
and
there's
an
omission
in
section
3
now
on
that
general
subject.
but
anyhow,
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
matter
is
moot
because
we
--
we
contend
and
we
believe
the
record
establishes
that
there
is
no
violation
of
section
3
here.
now
--
i
beg
your
pardon
about
that.
i
inquire
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bert
l.
overcash
in
conclusion,
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
position
of
these
five
states,
our
conviction
is
that
the
great
tragedy
in
this
whole
case
is
the
disregard
and
the
neglect
of
transportation
policy.
this
court
said
in
the
rock
island
case
that
this
declaration
of
policy
goes
to
the
basic
power
of
the
commission
and
that
policy
emphasizes
economy
and
efficiency.
now,
in
this
report
of
60
pages,
this
court
will
not
find
one
sentence
in
that
report
of
the
commission
discussing
transportation
policy
and
yet
this
situation
here
is
the
exact
reverse,
the
complete
reverse
of
every
prior
through
routes
case.
if
the
court
will
read
the
subiaco
case
and
the
stickell
case
rendered
by
this
court
and
the
(inaudible)
case
rendered
by
the
commission
in
276
i.c.c.,
the
court
will
find
that
in
all
prior
through
route
cases.
the
new
route
was
either
shorter
or
most
--
more
efficient
or
save
time
or
something
and
in
this
case
you
have
the
absolute
reverse
of
that
situation.
and
yet,
for
the
first
time
in
history
where
this
about
change
in
the
invocation
of
through
routes,
the
commission
has
not
in
the
entire
report
given
one
sentence
to
a
consideration
of
that
policy.
i
suggest
to
the
court
in
our
brief
that
under
that
tanzola
case,
a
recent
three-judge
opinion
on
that
point
alone
this
order
should
be
set
aside
because
the
court
said
so
in
that
case
that
when
there's
a
refusal,
when
they
give
no
consideration
to
this
important
requirement
of
the
act
that
that
alone
should
set
aside
the
entire
report.
so,
in
conclusion
i
submit
to
this
court
that
if
the
technique
in
approach
that
is
adopted
in
this
case
is
sufficient
to
sustain
this
order.
then
as
stated
by
judge
johnsen
in
the
omaha
case,
the
railroads
of
this
country
and
i
might
add
the
state
commissions
and
the
shippers
they
represent
may
as
well
forget
entirely
the
provisions
and
restrictions
and
protection
that
this
court
has
always
given
them
under
section
15
(4)
of
the
act.
