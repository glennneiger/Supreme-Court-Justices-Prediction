when
the
nebraska
court
limited
the
order
to
in-transit
privileges,
did
that
actually
cut
out
some
of
the
through
routes,
that
--
i
mean,
some
of
the
joint
rates
that
had
been
allowed?
justice
harold
burton
and
--
and
--
justice
harold
burton
the
same
commodities
but
only
--
only
--
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
when
you
--
when
you
used
the
term
through
route,
you
also
mean
joint
rate?
justice
harold
burton
might
be
a
combination
--
justice
harold
burton
might
be
a
combination
of
all
the
local
rates.
justice
harold
burton
well,
you're
--
aren't
you
then
bound
to
always
have
through
routes?
justice
harold
burton
if
you
--
if
you
want
the
ship,
pay
the
--
the
local
rates
right
through?
justice
harold
burton
why
are
you
discussing
those?
would
you
explain
to
me
what
the
in-transit
services
are
that
are
rendered
to
marble
and
the
granite?
justice
harold
burton
was
done
in-transit
instead
of
that
--
either
end
of
the
shipper?
justice
harold
burton
but
if
--
if
a
carrier
establishes
a
through
route
himself,
they
may
thereby
short-haul
themselves.
