in
order
to
close

what

that's
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
always
had
the
physical
through
route.
you
can't
pair
up
the
tracks.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
do
you
have
to
do?
do
you
have
to
refuse
to
accept
the
shipment
or
a
shipment
is
tendered
by
--
supposing
your
through
rates
are
cancelled,
joint
rates
are
cancelled,
the
shipper
wants
to
route
--
paying
the
combined
higher
rate
over
the
through
route,
under
your
--
under
your
definition
of
closing
does
the
--
anything
short
of
refusing
to
take
that
shipments
suffice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
must
refuse
to
take
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
if
he
does
take
it,
why
that's
an
indication
that
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
if
these
routes
are
opened?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
these
routes
are
opened,
however,
why,
you
don't
get
tangled
up
to
15
(4)
at
all,
or
if
rio
grande
doesn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
that
provision
after
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
you
would
rather
have
the
efficiency
of
the
union
pacific
and
the
competition
of
the
rio
grande?
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
the
better
use
of
your
community,
in
your
environment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
must
think
it
would
or
you
wouldn't
be
under
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
color?
justice
john
m.
harlan
since
the
commission
split
five-to-five
on
it,
what
is
your
view
about
what
the
real
test
of
that
through
--
the
close
through
route
is?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
a
difficult
question
now,
my
part
apparently
use
--
you
--
you
equate
of
this
--
part
of
the
commission
acquitted
a
--
a
through
route
with
a
joint
rate.
once
you
take
off
the
joint
rate
then
the
through
route
becomes
long
distant
commercially
non-existent
because
by
hypothesis
nobody
is
going
to
ship
over
in
a
more
expensive
route.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
true
that
the
difference
between
the
five
who
thought
there
was
a
through
route,
and
the
others
who
thought
that
there
was
not
a
through
route
is
really
not
a
difference
of
fact
over
the
facts.
it's
a
difference
over
the
legal
standing.
isn't
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
the
real
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
dispute
about
by
the
facts.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'll
accept
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
more
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
before
you
go
on?
i
hate
to
interrupt
you.
but
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
freedom
of
the
rio
grande
had
a
shipment
been
tendered
as
a
--
as
the
freedom
the
rio
grande
had
a
shipment
been
tendered
to
--
or
the
union
pacific,
i
mean,
the
shipment
been
tendered
for
a
through
route
in
chicago,
could
it
have
refused
to
accept
shipment
via
the
rio
grande?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
they
could
not
have
refused?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
how
can
the
rio
grande
--
how
could
the
union
pacific
have
closed
the
through
route
to
the
rio
grande
except
by
failing
to
publish
a
joint
rate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
in
other
words,
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
the
concept
of
the
through
route,
an
open
through
route,
does
not
exist
apart
from
the
commercial
feasibility
which
means
the
existence
of
a
joint
rate,
that's
what
you're
really
saying
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
it
--
was
the
qualification?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
ginnane,
in
the
days
when
the
through
routes
with
joint
rates,
the
union
pacific
and
the
rio
grande,
they
were
part
of
the
union's
pacific
announced
tariff
--
announced
routing
schedules,
i
suppose.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
happened
after
they
canceled,
after
the
union
pacific
canceled
the
joint
rates?
did
the
through
routes
still
continue
to
be
shown
on
the
union
pacific's
tariffs?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
it
put
a
combination
rates
as
distinguished
from
the
joint
rates
or
what
happened?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
routes
themselves
still
were
advertised?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
if
a
shipper,
looking
at
the
union
pacific's
tariffs,
at
any
time
after
1897,
whatever
that
date
was,
he
would
find
a
route
advertised
or
stated
in
the
tariffs
at
a
combination
rate
which
included
the
rio
grande
to
points
east,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
applying
your
own
test,
why
doesn't
this
inclusion
of
the
through
route
in
the
tariff
represent
a
holding
out
by
the
union
pacific
to
that
business,
applying
your
own
test?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
for
the
shipper
to
decide.
maybe
he'd
like
--
he's
willing
to
pay
those
routes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
isn't
because
of
a
lack
of
holding
out
by
the
union
pacific,
that's
because
the
shippers
prefer
to
take
a
cheaper
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
examples
of
those
tariffs,
modern
tariffs,
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
add
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
add
to
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
what
your
subsequent
tariffs
after
cancellation
showed
as
well?
justice
john
m.
harlan
