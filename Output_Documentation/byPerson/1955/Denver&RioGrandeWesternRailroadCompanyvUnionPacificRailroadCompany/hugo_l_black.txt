but
suppose
the
commission
had
taken
the
other
position.
now,
what
effect
would
the
failure
to
find
in
favor
of
d
&
r.g.
have?
in
other
words,
what
is
the
duty
of
the
court,
when
the
commission
divided
five
and
five,
on
the
point
where
the
burden
is
on
the
railroad
to
make
its
claim,
divided
5-to-5?
what's
the
duty
of
the
court
in
connection
with
deciding
those
facts
anew
or
as
to
deciding
those
facts
for
the
first
time?
what
is
your
idea
of
the
function
of
the
court
there
as
of
--
in
reviewing
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
that
supplement
the
findings
or
lack
of
findings?
justice

well,
the
--
the
duty
is
on
the
commission
to
make
findings,
if
it
can,
of
facts.
one
party
alleges
certain
facts.
the
commission
finds
it's
against
that
party
by
dividing
5-to-5.
can
the
commission
supplement
the
position
taken
in
the
trial
of
that
to
please
the
court
by
a
new
position
it
takes
into
court
or
--
justice

did
it
have
to
take
it
in
a
commission
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
your
view,
if
i
get
it,
i'm
--
i'm
a
little
far
from
it,
i
don't
recall
the
case
exactly
but
your
view
seems
to
be
that
since
they
were
advised
to
file,
the
commission
has
acted
on
to
something.
so,
that
gives
--
that
was
--
that
did
amount
to
a
fact
finding
by
them
against
the
d
&
r.g.,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
are
--
the
fact
that
they
are
now
taking
that
position
in
the
court
is
not
a
mere
--
not
a
supplementing
of
finding
of
fact
but
taking
the
position
that
the
facts
were
found
by
a
failure
to
find
by
a
majority
of
the
other
way?

mr.

you

you
concede
that
that
conflicts
it
all
of
your
statement
that
the

that

to

rendered

that

give

if
it

justice

so,
the
commission
found
according
to
your
brief
on
page
51
that
their
ultimate
finding
was
that
the
establishment
of
said

were
necessary
and
desirable
in
the
public
interest
in
order
to
provide
adequate

more
economic

you
do
not
think
that
conflicts
at
all
with
what
is
said
at

has
been
made?

that's

and
over
on
the

it

that

and
you
refer
to
the
commission's
findings
on
your
page

where
the
commission
found
that
the
establishment
of

entirely

so,
from
your
standpoint,
it's
wholly
immaterial
that
they

that
