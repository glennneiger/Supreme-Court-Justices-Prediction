mr.
frank
e.
holman
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
appear
here
in
behalf
of
the
denver
and
rio
grande
western
railroad,
the
appellant
in
appeal
number
117,
which
is
the
first
appeal
in
point
of
time
while
in
this
court
of
this
series
of
appeals.
i'm
sure
the
court
is
already
weary
with
its
morning
labors
and
looking
forward
to
the
recess
which
i
understand
is
at
2
o'clock.
but
i
will
begin
and
proceed
as
far
as
possible
to
that
point.
i
am
also
authorized
to
speak
in
behalf
of
the
various
intervenors
who
have
filed
briefs
here
on
the
rio
grande
site.
one
of
those
intervenors
is
represented
by
mr.
william
j.
hickey
and
is
the
american
short
line
railroad
association.
there
are
several
intervenors
represented
by
mr.
lee
j.
quasey.
these
intervenors
represent
a
number
of
live
stock
associations,
cattlemen's
associations,
and
only
refers
to
our
second
page
rather
of
his
reply
brief
where
is
a
list
of
these
intervenors.
i
am
also
authorized
to
speak
for
the
public
service
commission
of
utah
and
the
public
utilities
commission
of
the
state
of
colorado,
and
a
large
number
of
other
intervenors
represented
by
mr.
john
r.
barry.
perhaps,
it
should
be
said
in
passing
to
the
court
that
i
was
not
one
of
counsel
in
any
of
the
proceedings
below.
and
hence,
i
have
approached
the
issues
in
these
appeals
from
a
study
and
an
examination
of
the
record.
the
appeals
in
numbers
117,
118,
and
119
are
from
a
three-judge
statutory
district
court
of
nebraska.
the
appeals
in
numbers
332,
333,
and
334
are
from
a
judgment,
one
of
a
three-judge
statutory
federal
court
in
the
district
of
colorado.
all
of
these
appeals
concern
the
validity
of
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
of
january
12,
1953.
the
appeals,
as
you
know,
have
been
consolidated
for
briefs,
arguments,
and
disposition.
the
proceedings
before
the
commission
were
initiated
by
a
complaint
of
the
denver
and
rio
grande
western
railroad
company
against
the
union
pacific
and
a
large
number
of
other
railroads.
there
were
many
intervenors
on
what
may
be
termed
as
the
side
of
the
rio
grande
and
what
may
be
termed
the
side
of
the
union
pacific.
but
these
intervenors
spoke
for
themselves,
as
the
record
will
show.
now,
if
the
court
please,
before
undertaking
to
argue
any
of
the
controverted
issues,
i
would
like
the
privilege
of
making
a
preliminary
factual
statement
in
an
attempt
to
clarify
the
proceedings
below
and
to
outline
the
position
that
the
parties
take
in
this
court.
this
factual
statement,
however,
will
be
better
understood
if
you
will
permit
me
to
call
your
attention
briefly
to
the
statutes,
which
admittedly,
control
a
determination
of
the
issue.
as
you
are
well
aware
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
united
states
code,
title
49
as
a
preamble,
a
declaration
of
national
transportation
policy.
and
it
recites,
in
general,
that
the
act
is
designed
to
promote
safe,
adequate,
economical,
efficient
transportation
among
the
several
carriers
and
to
encourage
the
establishment
and
the
maintenance
of
reasonable
charges
for
transportation
service
without
unjust
discriminations,
undue
preferences
or
advantages.
now,
a
great
deal
will
be
said
here
today
by
all
counsel
with
respect
to
section
15
(4)
of
that
act.
there
is
nothing
complicated
about
this
section,
in
my
view.
in
simple
english,
it
is
designed
and
we
admit
that,
it
is
designed
to
protect
the
railroad,
unless
it
consents
to
waive
the
privilege
in
what
is
called
its
long
haul,
which
is
the
longest
haul
it
can
make
over
its
own
rails
when
participating
in
the
movement
of
traffic
on
a
through
route
over
several
connecting
railroads.
but
this
privilege
of
protecting
its
long
haul
is
not
in
the
nature
of
an
absolute
right.
this
would
produce,
if
fixed
(inaudible)
monopoly
of
traffic.
so,
congress
wisely
empowered
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
establish
new
through
routes
whenever
the
commission
found
it
to
be
in
the
public
interest,
and
found
that
the
no
through
route
is
needed
in
order
to
provide
adequate
and
more
efficient
or
more
economic
transportation.
when
no
through
route
exists,
and
one
is
to
be
established
--
i
have
the
red
light
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
thank
you.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
a
brief
reference
perhaps
should
be
made
which
come
under
this
litigation.
section
1
(4)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
you
all
know
deals
with
the
matter
of
reasonable
rates
in
fares
and
charges
and
requires
every
common
carrier
to
furnish
transportation
on
reasonable
request
and
to
establish
such
just
reasonable
rates,
fares
and
charges.
now,
1
(5)
which
is
somewhat
complimentary
to
that
merely
declares
that
unjust
and
unreasonable
charges
were
in
part,
there
over
prohibited,
which
were
unlawful.
section
1
(3)
or
rather
3
(1)
of
the
act
is
what
we
call
the
provision
with
respect
to
discrimination,
as
if
we
pointed
out
that
that
is
discrimination
as
between
shippers
in
localities,
and
not
between
carriers.
over
section
3
(4)
deals
with
the
matter
of
discrimination
as
between
carriers.
this
section,
3
(4)
requires
carriers
to
afford
reasonable,
proper,
and
equal
facilities
for
the
interchange
of
traffic
between
respective
lines
and
connecting
lines
and
forbids
them
to
discriminate
between
their
respective
lines
and
connecting
lines
and
rates
and
fares
and
charges.
section
15
of
the
act
is
sometimes
said
in
a
general
way
to
implement
these
other
provisions
since
the
other
provisions
are
merely
declarations
of
law,
15
empowers
--
15
(1)
empowers
the
commission
to
prescribe
just
and
reasonable
railroad
rates,
fares
and
charges,
and
so
on.
and
15
(3),
by
way
of
further
implementation
authorizes
and
requires
the
commission
on
average
deem
necessary
and
desirable
in
the
public
interest
to
establish
through
routes
and
joint
rates,
fares
and
charges
so
much
with
the
statute
or
the
statutory
background.
you're
all,
of
course,
familiar
with
definition,
what
had
occurred
to
me,
we
might
as
well
bring
them
out
and
then
i
will
proceed
to
the
factual
statement
as
such
that
through
route
as
merely
an
arrangement
expressed
or
implied
or
established
by
the
commission
between
connecting
railroads
for
the
continuous
carriage
of
goods
from
one
originating
point
to
another.
a
through
rate
so-called,
is
a
general
term
that
applies
in
a
general
way
to
any
through
carriage
of
goods
or
one
type
of
a
through
rate
is
a
joint
rate,
which
is
ordinarily
lower
than
a
combination
rate
or
a
combination
of
locals
as
it's
called.
a
competitive
joint
rate
is
a
type
of
joint
rate
which
is
identical
as
between
common
points
of
origin
and
common
points
of
destination.
that's
of
some
importance
here
if
i
may
turn
to
this
map
which
one
of
my
associate
said
that
succeeded
in
shutting
my
clients
off
from
me.
for
example
at
this
point
here,
portland,
by
the
way
this
map
is
an
enlargement
of
the
map,
exhibit
c,
in
the
brief
and
it's
supported
by
the
record.
the
southern
pacific,
for
example,
will
take
a
shipment
coming
down
on
this
long
route
and
going
to
st.
louis
at
the
same
competitive
joint
rates
with
the
union
pacific
will
take
it
and
carry
it
on.
well,
the
competitive
rate
is
a
rate
that's
identical
from
an
identical
point
of
origin
on
a
through
route,
to
an
identical
point
of
destination.
a
fuller
and
i
think
the
best
exposition
to
this
mode
of
rates
and
charges
and
so
on
as
found
in
mr.
brandeis'
--
mr.
justice
brandies'
note,
note
4
in
st.
louis
in
southwestern
railway
versus
united
states,
245
u.s.
at
139.
now,
as
i
have
indicated,
these
appeals
arise
out
of
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
all
the
issues
stemmed
from
that
order.
we
believe
that
the
issues
maybe
best
clarified
by
propounding
certain
factual
inquiries.
first,
what
was
the
situation,
the
factual
situation
which
caused
the
rio
grande
to
file
its
complaint
before
the
commission?
two,
what
relief
did
that
complaint
seek?
three,
what
relief
did
the
commission
grant?
four,
what
is
the
position
of
the
parties
in
this
court
with
respect
to
the
action
of
the
two
united
states
district
courts?
now,
as
to
the
first
inquiry,
the
situation
which
caused
the
rio
grande
to
file
its
complaint,
turning
to
the
map,
we
have
shown
the
routes
of
the
union
pacific,
not
all
of
them
because
some
of
them
are
not
of
any
particular
important,
but
generally,
the
routes
of
the
union
pacific
in
red,
and
the
rio
grande
in
green.
the
rio
grande
has
2400
miles
of
railway,
extending
generally
between
ogden,
utah,
denver,
colorado,
and
other
colorado
common
points,
colorado
springs,
pueblo
and
trinidad.
the
union
pacific
has
two
eastern
terminals
sometimes
set
with
the
omaha
but
actually
counted
for
us
and
then
came
pacific.
the
union
pacific
would
be
first
in
the
line
from
omaha
in
the
state
of
wyoming
from
its
other
terminals
that
proceeds
to
denver
then
up
and
joins
the
line
there
and
comes
into
ogden,
utah
which
is
what's
called
the
“closed
gateway”
here.
it
has
a
short
--
got
a
branch
running
from
(inaudible)
when
it
reaches
ogden,
we
have
suggested
in
the
brief
that
it
has
two
branches
of
a
wye.
one
branch
of
the
wye
comes
down
south
through
utah
and
southern
nevada
and
through
the
los
angeles
area.
the
other
branch
of
wye
goes
up
here
to
the
northwest
and
then
there
is
branch
also
to
butte,
montana.
these
are
the
crucial
points
in
the
sense
in
connection
with
the
gateway
situation.
now,
at
various
points
in
the
brief,
there
is
something
of
a
change
terms.
for
example,
in
certain
places
in
the
commission
order,
this
area
north
of
ogden
was
called
“excluded
area.”
it's
the
area
in
which
the
union
pacific
declined
to
accord
joint
competitive
rates
coming
down
to
ogden,
going
over
the
rio
grande
and
going
south
and
east.
in
some
places,
it's
called
the
northwest
area.
in
other
places,
it's
called
the
“closed
door”
territory.
those
terms
are
interchangeable.
we
call
it
the
“closed
door
territory”,
it's
the
ogden
gateway
that
follow
it
and
that
area
is
close
to
the
rio
grande.
now,
rio
grande
is
connected
at
denver
with
four
railroads,
the
rock
island,
the
burlington,
sante
fe
and
the
colorado
southern.
at
colorado
springs
with
the
burlington,
sante
fe,
colorado
southern,
at
(inaudible)
with
the
sante
fe
and
the
missouri
pacific
and
the
colorado
southern
and
trinidad
with
the
sante
fe
and
the
colorado
southern.
in
other
words,
the
rio
grande
is
not
a
detached
railroad
situated
by
itself
in
the
center
of
the
continent.
it
is
connected
up
here
with
all
the
main
lines
from
two
traffics
and
here,
it
has
its
connection
with
the
western
pacific,
out
at
salt
lake
through
the
coast
and
at
ogden
with
the
southern
pacific.
so
that
in
a
general
way
is
the
factual
situation
with
respect
to
the
location
of
the
railroads.
that
is
the
two
main
railroads
that
we're
talking
about.
the
other
railroads
are
in
black
and
certain
routes
have
been
designated
which
i'll
call
to
your
attention
in
a
moment.
now,
as
we
put
it
and
we
put
it
without
any
intention
of
being
rhetorical,
we
say
that
this
“closed
door”
territory
in
here
is
maintained,
it's
a
kind
of
a
union
pacific
monopoly
as
that
a
kind
of
principality
in
which
they
undertake
to
say
to
various
connecting
roads
whether
they
will
entertain
traffic
on
through
routes
with
joint
competitive
rates
or
not.
when
--
since
they
do
entertain
traffic
up
here,
generally
speaking
from
huntington
in
here
with
the
northern
transcontinental,
they
do
entertain
here,
go
over
the
shipment,
may
go
over
route
number
nine
and
way
down
here
and
into
st.
louis
at
a
joint
competitive
rates.
but
it
may
not
come
down
through
ogden
all
over
the
rio
grande
and
going
to
st.
louis
at
a
joint
competitive
rates
or
a
competitive
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
e.
holman
that's
exactly
what
i
want
to
come
to
now.
now,
we've
indicated
several
routes
here.
route
one
is
the
union
pacific.
the
union
pacific,
of
course,
from
many
points
in
this
area,
coming
through
(inaudible)
where
it's
cutoff,
and
what
breaks
down
in
denver,
on
a
little
shorter
milage
from
ourselves,
put
it
in
to
kansas
city.
but
the
second
shortest
route
of
all
these
routes
in
which
they
short
route
themselves,
that
that
short
route
is
the
rio
grande
with
reference
to
the
first
route,
the
union
pacific
coming
through
here
where
the
shortest
route
is
in
2167
miles
to
st.
louis.
often,
they
don't
come
by
that
route
as
the
record
shows.
they
come
down
to
ogden
and
come
through
it
but
giving
them
credit
for
that,
that
route
is
2232
miles
from
this
portland
area
through
st.
louis
or
it's
3%
longer
than
their
shortest
route.
now,
the
rio
grande
comes
and
our
route
is
only
9%
longer
than
the
shortest
of
the
union
pacific.
these
others
range
up
to
45
where
the
shipment
coming
down
here
from
north
portland
coming
down
route
number
nine,
through
--
pass
up
to
santa
rosa,
goes
to
st.
louis
at
a
competitive
joint
rate
on
a
through
route,
but
a
shipment
may
not
come
down
through
this
way
and
over
the
rio
grande
at
a
competitive
joint
rate
and
a
through
route.
so
that
the
--
without
taking
the
turns,
with
all
those
routes,
this
map
and
it's
the
same
map
which
you
have
in
the
brief
indicates
this
mileage
of
differentials
and
the
other
railroads
with
whom
the
union
pacific
was
short-haul
itself,
but
we're
not
sure
it's
all
itself
with
the
rio
grande.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
that's
right,
yes.
then
here
is
another
situation,
i
should
call
to
your
attention.
the
union
pacific
accords
us
a
through
route
and
a
joint
competitive
rate
from
the
los
angeles
area
through
the
salt
lake
and
the
provo
gateways.
in
other
words,
shippers
of
fruit,
then
cattle
and
livestock
and
so
on,
who
want
to
use
the
rio
grande
to
get
into
this
area,
have
a
through
route
and
a
competitive
joint
rate
over
the
rio
grande
in
this
area,
but
this
area
they
do
not.
and
one
of
our
contention
is
that
under
the
statute
that
gives
a
preference
to
these
growers
down
in
california
and
nevada,
if
i
may
say
so,
over
the
shippers
and
growers
in
that
area.
now
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
frank
e.
holman
well
15
(8),
mr.
justice
reed
and
in
our
view,
that
somewhat
designed
or
denied
by
the
union
pacific.
a
shipper
has
a
choice
of
a
through
route,
only
if
one
as
in
existence
and
he
has
that
choice
if
it's
in
existence
even
though
there
is
no
competitive
joint
rate,
even
though
it's
combination
of
locals.
other
words,
i'm
coming
immediately
to
that,
shippers
can
and
do
use
the
rio
grande
provided
they
pay
a
higher
rate.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
well,
there
are
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
oh
yes.
he
always
has
a
choice.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
no.
no,
that's
right.
he'd
have
the
choice.
now
then,
as
to
the
relief
sought
by
the
rio
grande,
the
rio
grande
and
its
complaint
before
the
commission
alleged
that
through
routes
are
already
in
existence,
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
a
matter
of
law
through
this
ogden
gateway.
originally,
through
routes
and
competitive
joint
rates
were
in
existence
when
the
oregon
short
line
railway
operated
this
line
across
huntington
up
to
butte
and
the
oregon
western
railroad
and
navigation
operated
the
other.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
record
that
in
1897
and
from
then
on
through
routes
existed
and
competitive
joint
rates
existed
over
these
lines
that
we
are
now
talking
about.
what
the
union
pacific
says
that
when
they
took
control
of
those
lines,
beginning
in
1906,
they
reacquired
the
oregon
short
line
and
the
oregon
railroad
and
navigation
that
--
then
they
cancelled
the
competitive
joint
rates
and
that
everybody
should
have
known
that
they
meant
by
that
to
cancel
the
competitive
through
routes.
we
take
the
position
fundamentally
and
that's
why
in
our
brief
on
here,
we
argue
first
what's
called
the
colorado
case
because
that
case
held
that
the
commission
erred
as
a
matter
of
law
in
failing
to
hold
the
through
routes
were
in
existence.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
if
their
remand
is
broad
enough,
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
has
so
stated
in
its
--
in
its
brief
when
we
go
along
with
that.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
15
(3)
wouldn't
be
out.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
it
goes
back
under
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
--
15
(3)
and
--
and
these
other
sections,
15
(4)
would
be
out,
yes,
quite
right.
there
is,
however,
and
i
want
to
directly
represent
my
interveners,
i
have
a
kind
of
a
double
task
here
and
i'd
like
to
clear
that
up
if
i
may.
through
routes
and
competitive
joint
rates
were
granted
by
the
commission
on
certain
commodities
under
the
authority
they
had
in
15
(4).
so,
it
does
necessarily
follow
as
some
of
our
interveners
contend
if
you'll
examine
their
briefs
does
necessarily
follow
that
they
want
to
give
up
on
those
particular
commodities,
livestock
for
example,
and
have
it
all
sent
back
to
the
commission.
but
logically,
what
you
have
suggested
is
correct.
now,
i
want
to
also
verify
the
issues
by
referring
you
to
the
cross-hatched
map
so-called
in
the
brief
because
i
think
it's
quite
important
that
you
have
both
as
to
colorado
and
the
nebraska
case
exactly
what
the
commission
held.
that's
a
little
difficult
at
first
or
at
least
it
was
for
me.
if
you'll
go
to
appendix
c
at
page
135
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
that's
our
opening
buff
brief,
the
rio
grande
opening
brief,
yes,
page
135,
appendix
c.
now,
there's
a
cross-hatched
map
which
is
also
a
map
that's
in
the
record
and
you
will
note
that
there
is
an
area
that's
cross-hatched
covering
parts
of
eastern
colorado,
kansas,
nebraska,
north
dakota,
wisconsin
and
running
down
southerly.
i
never
could
understand
quite
why
it
projected
down
southerly
into
what
might
we
called
rio
grande
territory,
but
it
does.
now,
in
order
--
because
they
were
operating
under
the
restrictions
of
15
(4),
the
commission
felt
that
there
was
a
right
under
that
that
the
union
pacific
should
be
protected
on
its
long-haul,
at
least
so
far
as
-
was
possible.
so,
under
the
commission
order
now
on
these
eight
or
10
commodities
that
are
listed,
the
commission
gave
us
through
route
and
competitive
joint
rate
out
of
this
closed
door
territory,
coming
down
here
but
not
to
denver,
not
the
colorado
springs.
you'll
notice
that
little
line
on
the
cross-hatch,
that
colorado
going
south
from
denver,
leaves
denver
in
these
points
in
the
cross-hatched
territory,
that's
forbidden
territory
to
us
under
the
commission
order.
so,
that
we
control
the
short-haul
ourselves.
we
pick
up
freight
here
in
this
area
within
the
rio
grande
territory.
we
can't
ship
it
over
our
line
and
have
it
go
in
there
under
the
commission
order,
but
we
have
to
deliver
it
at
denver.
in
other
words,
the
one
effect
of
the
commission
order
is
that
we're
compelled
to
short-haul
ourselves
on
our
end
in
order
to
preserve
their
long-haul
so
that
the
commission
order
doesn't
give
us
competitive
joint
rates
and
the
through
routes
to
any
of
those
colorado
common
points.
also,
if
you'll
note,
we
have
to
ship
through
this
designated
area
and
on
some
--
to
some
points
south
and
east
in
order
to
get
these
rates.
so,
without
going
into
that
farther,
i
did
want
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
order
protects
the
union
pacific
under
15
(4)
to
the
farthest
extent
of
its
long-haul,
clear
through
on
its
lands
to
denver,
omaha
and
so
on
except
that.
kansas
city,
missouri
and
omaha
since
they
are
also
focal
points
or
gateways,
we'd
have
to
go
through
those
to
get
a
shipment
down
to
springfield,
illinois
so,
if
we
have
a
through
shipment,
we
can
go
into
omaha
and
on.
but
we
can't
operate
within
our
own
territory
here,
colorado
common
point,
we
have
to
short-haul
ourselves
under
this
order.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
not
at
all
and
we're
not
appealing
here.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
that's
--
that's
quite
correct.
i
was
only
trying
to
make
clear
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
--
that
the
commission
did,
yes.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
yes.
--
my
own
mind.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
yes,
essentially.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
oh,
no.
we
never
went
up.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
no.
oh,
no.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
oh,
we
--
we
answered
--
we
stayed
in,
and
were
through
that
case
all
the
way
along.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
yes.
and
we
reserved
the
right
specifically.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
no,
no,
no,
not
at
all.
no,
we
never
withdrew
at
all.
we're
quite
active
in
it.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
oh,
yes.
because
the
commission
allowed
us
competitive
joint
rates,
only
limited
by
commodities
and
territory.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
the
commission
or
the
nebraska
court
restricted
that
by
allowing
competitive
joint
rates
only
on
shipment
that
have
in-transit
privileges
on
the
rio
grande,
so
that
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
only
if
in-transit.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
so,
the
enigma
--
that
decision
is,
if
i
may
pursue
that
inquiry,
is
--
that
if
--
if
a
shipper
here
wants
to
ship
on
the
through
route
where
the
railroad
isn't
put
to
the
expense
of
permitting,
unloading
and
so
on,
he
has
to
pay
a
higher
rate
(inaudible)
on
oklahoma
city
and
if
he
is
going
to
put
the
railroad
to
in-transit
privileges.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
well,
mr.
quirk,
you
handle
that,
will
you
answer
that
please?
i
was
not
aware
that
there
was
any
such
withdrawal
of
petition.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
yes.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
well,
i
was
not
aware
of
it,
your
honor.
may
we
answer
that
fact
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
--
because
mr.
quirk
handled
that
case?
oh
yes,
the
government
helps
me
out.
it
shows
that
we
filed
an
amended
petition
to
intervene.
and
there
was
an
order
allowing
that.
now,
thank
you.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
yes.
now,
the
position
of
the
parties
then
comes
to
this.
the
union
pacific
and
its
interveners
contend
that
the
colorado
court
should
be
reversed,
the
nebraska
court
should
be
reversed,
the
commissioner
order
should
be
reversed
in
its
entirety
and
the
rio
grande
should
be
accorded
no
relief
whatever.
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
but
not
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
secretary
of
agriculture,
the
record
will
show
was
quite
active
in
favoring
the
opening
up
of
this
closed
door
territory
and
testified
among
other
things
that
it's
in
our
brief
and
he
didn't
think
it
would
lose
the
union
pacific
any
business
at
all.
it
would
develop
the
territory
and
open
it
up
to
shipment.
but
at
least
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
united
states
contends
that
the
colorado
court
should
be
reversed.
the
government
is
on
our
side
with
respect
to
the
nebraska
decision
and
contends
all
including
the
united
states,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture
contend
that
the
nebraska
decision
modifying
interstate
commerce
commission
order
should
be
reversed
and
the
commission
order
of
january
12th,
1953
should
be
restored.
the
rio
grande
and
its
interveners
contend
that
the
colorado
decision
should
be
affirmed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
commission
with
instructions
that
through
routes
via
the
ogden
gateway
are
in
existence
and
that
the
rio
grande
is
entitled
to
have
the
case
reconsidered
and
decided
by
the
commission
freed
of
the
limitations
of
15
(4).
we
believe
there's
a
part
of
such
remand,
the
nebraska
decision
should
be
reversed
from
the
commission's
order
set
aside
insofar
as
it
denies
relief.
there
might
be
no
need
of
setting
it
aside
or
again
responding
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
to
the
affirmative
relief
that's
been
granted
because
we
have
through
routes
now
and
competitive
joint
rates
on
eight
commodities.
we
--
we
don't
have
it
on
grain
and
lumber
and
many
other
things.
now,
as
to
the
argument
of
the
controverted
issues,
first
of
all,
as
i
have
indicated,
the
rio
grande
complaint
alleged
the
existence
of
through
routes,
alleged
they
were
in
existence
during
the
days
of
the
ogden
short
line
railroad
and
the
ogden
railroad
and
navigation
company.
that
matter
was
considered
a
great
length
for
the
commission
and
it
ended
up
by
division
of
opinion
of
five-to-five
between
the
members
of
the
commission
as
to
the
existence
of
through
routes.
the
colorado
court
proceeded
on
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
no,
sir.
no,
it
may
be
a
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
--
a
competitive
joint
rate.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
that's
right.
oh,
yes.
we
have
--
we
have
the
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
well,
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
no,
because
they
can
under
15
(8)
as
we
believe
and
under
15
(7),
they
can
publish
in
their
tariffs
if
they
wish
to
do
so
that
through
routes
have
been
discontinued
and
it's
quite
important
that
the
public
and
the
carriers,
and
everybody
should
know
whether
there
has
been
a
discontinuance
of
through
routes.
they're
discontinued
and
put
in
operation
most
everyday.
mr.
hickey
brought
me
a
whole
series
of
sheets
at
my
hotel
room
the
other
day
which
show
and
they're
in
this
record
too,
which
show
that
sometimes
they
cancel
the
rate
and
leave
the
through
route.
and
we
suggest
that
that's
what
the
union
pacific
did
here
because
through
shipments
did
move
over
as
the
evidence
shows.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
--
the
through
route
was
used
even
at
the
higher
rate.
the
government
has
suggested
one
point
that
that
use
was
inadvertent
and
unintentional.
well,
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
for
several
instances
where
people
paid
the
higher
rate.
mr.
barry,
here
in
his
brief
shows
where
a
sheep
grower
paid
$60
to
$70
dollars
more
a
car,
i
think
it
is,
because
he
thought
he
could
get
better
feeding
privileges
along
the
rio
grande,
which
are
these
stock
people
up
in
this
area.
they
--
they
have
plenty
car
loads
of
stock.
they
may
want
to
send
one
or
send
10
car
loads
along
the
union
pacific
and
10
along
the
rio
grande
that
these
people
in
wyoming,
know
that
they've
got
to
send
all
their
stocks
through
wyoming,
the
price
of
hay
goes
up
and
things
change.
but
if
you
get
competition
and
sometimes
even
at
the
higher
rate,
as
is
shown
in
mr.
barry's
brief,
they've
shipped
out
of
this
closed-door
territory
in
order
to
get
certain
economic
advantages
along
the
rio
grande.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
well,
i'm
coming
to
that
right
now.
here
is
what
it
has
to
do.
it
has
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
its
intention,
as
shown
by
its
tariff,
when
it
changes
its
rate
is
to
close
the
through
route
and
that
is
the
practice.
the
--
it's
been
done
over
and
over
again
and
the
union
pacific
has
merely
claimed
that
the
cancellation
of
the
--
the
competitive
joint
rate
meant
the
cancellation
of
the
through
route.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
what
they've
done
here
is
use
these
as
standby
through
routes,
that
when
the
union
pacific
gets
in
the
storm
conditions
as
said
here,
and
wants
the
through
routes.
it
doesn't
go
to
interstate
commerce
commission
and
get
a
temporary
through
route.
it
has
drastic
routes,
the
through
routes
over
our
land
here.
the
evidence
shows
a
great
many
shipments
that
have
been
made
so
that
this
is
a
standby
through
routes
and
there
is
no
such
animal
so
to
speak,
in
the
law.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
that's
right.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
it
must
refuse
to
take
it.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
yes.
it
doesn't
have
to
take
it,
yes.
it
doesn't
have
to
take.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
that's
right.
well,
that's
--
that's
covered
at
considerable
length
that
mr.
hickey's
brief
at
pages
9
and
10.
you'd
turn
to
mr.
hickey's
brief
at
page
9
and
10.
you'll
find
that
whole
problem
discussed.
our
--
our
resume
of
it
is
merely
this
that
if
when
a
railroad
cancels
competitive
joint
rates
over
through
routes
at
which
is
also
to
close
the
through
routes,
it
could
do
so
legally
and
factually
by
simply
publishing
in
its
tariffs
that
it
will
not
thereafter
issue
a
through
bill
of
lading.
it
can
issue
a
local
bill
of
lading
or
accept
shipments
which
are
routed
by
shippers
over
the
previous
existing
through
routes.
the
union
pacific
failed
to
take
this
significant
and
essential
step
for
effectually
closing
the
through
routes
over
the
rio
grande
via
the
ogden
gateway
and
the
--
yes,
that's
the
brief,
mr.
hickey's
brief,
9
and
10,
that's
in
here
pages
9
and
10.
so,
we
--
to
summarize,
take
the
position
that
the
colorado
court
was
correct
when
it
found
on
the
undisputed
evidence
in
the
case
that
these
through
routes
have
never
been
cancelled
here.
well,
that
would
be
enough
if
that
is
the
fact,
but
also,
if
shippers
had
been
using
them
as
through
routes.
that's
another
established
one
of
through
routes.
i
haven't
time
for
the
moment
to
refer
to
that
evidence,
what
--
the
evidence
is
in
the
brief
as
to
the
actual
use
of
that.
now,
so
much
for
that,
the
next
point
in
the
colorado
decision
is
the
judgment
to
the
effect
that
the
error
of
the
commission
in
this
regard
or
assuming
that
it's
--
it's
a
legal
error,
not
administrative
finding.
the
evidence
was
undisputed,
counsel
on
cross-examination
by
chairman
aldrich
submitted
the
through
routes
were
in
existence
but
they
merely
have
to
pay
a
higher
price.
the
chief
traffic
witness
of
the
union
pacific,
mr.
(inaudible)
admits
that
through
routes
were
in
existence,
but
they
had
to
pay
a
higher
price.
but
then
they
said
a
through
route
maybe
closed
commercially.
if
you
have
the
economic
deterrent,
that
closes
it.
all
the
evidence
showed
that
some
people
want
to
use
the
rio
grande
badly
enough
that
they
went
ahead
and
shipped
anyway
even
at
the
higher
rate.
now,
the
question
comes
up
as
to
the
error
of
the
commission,
i'll
take
another
five
minutes
out
of
my
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
--
15,
that
the
error
of
the
commission
prejudiced
the
entire
proceeding.
union
pacific
contends
strongly
that
the
commission
wouldn't
do
anything
more
about
this
if
it
went
back.
well,
we
don't
know
of
course.
we
can't
prejudge
what
the
commission
would
do,
free
to
this
limitation,
but
in
all
events,
you
have
situations
like
this
which
are
important.
certainly,
when
the
commission
in
order
to
preserved
the
long-haul
under
15
(4)
through
the
line
and
west
side
of
denver,
and
will
not
give
at
a
through
route
to
denver,
if
they're
reconsidering
it
without
the
limitations
of
15
(4),
would
be
rather
ridiculous
not
to
give
us
a
through
route
to
the
colorado
common
points
into
our
own
territory.
so,
if
one
had
time,
there
are
many
situations
in
this
picture
whereby
the
commission
except
as
judge
phillips
solved
to
the
self
imposed
limitation
would
have
a
freedom
of
action
where
they
could
have
taken
a
different
view
of
the
matter.
now,
i'm
sorry
i
have
hardly
reached
the
--
i
haven't
reached
the
nebraska
case,
the
government
will
be
most
interested
in
that.
i
do
want
to
get
to
this
view
before
you
however,
as
to
the
nebraska
case.
i
did
make
an
analysis,
a
careful
analysis
of
the
commission
opinion.
it's
very
long,
somewhat
involved,
what
those
are,
but
i
think
that
findings
are
substantial,
that
the
findings
support
the
conclusions
and
that
the
evidence
supports
the
findings
and
that
there
is
evidence
there.
the
main
thing
and
perhaps
the
only
thing
i
have
time
for
with
respect
to
the
nebraska
case
is
that
it's
inevitable
on
any
view
of
the
nebraska
case
to
come
to
any
other
conclusion,
but
that
the
court
substituted
its
administrative
judgement
for
the
administrative
judgment
of
the
commission.
an
opinion
was
delivered
here
this
morning
which
touched
upon
that
question.
because
the
only
change
they
made
was
the
same
evidence
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
the
only
change
they
made
was
--
which
still
have
the
eight
commodities,
we
still
have
the
area,
the
open
area
beyond
this
restricted
area
what
--
they
reduced
it
by
saying
that
the
need,
the
public
need
and
the
public
necessity
was
only
for
shipments
out
of
this
closed-door
territory
which
went
over
the
rio
grande
and
required
in-transit
privileges
which
leaves
the
anomaly
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
that
if
you're
a
shipper
in
the
idaho
area
and
you
want
to
ship
potatoes
through
(inaudible),
you
have
to
pay
a
higher
rate
if
you
use
the
rio
grande
and
if
you
want
to
ship
into
salt
lake
city
and
have
them
unloaded
and
sorted
and
processed
and
despite
of
all
that
expense,
the
shipper
who
has
in-transit
privileges
get
a
--
gets
a
cheaper
rate
on
the
shipper
who
ships
right
through.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
if
the
court
please.
not
to
belabor
the
discussion
that's
just
taken
place
that
arose
originally,
i
think,
with
the
chief
justice's
question
yesterday
of
counsel
of
the
union
pacific
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
the
union
pacific's
facilities
are
adequate.
and
counsel
directed
your
honors'
attention
then
only
to
the
statement
under
opposition
testimony.
and
that,
i
submit,
is
not
a
finding
and
was
not
so
intended.
the
real
finding
which
hasn't
yet
been
called
to
the
attention
of
this
court
is
on
page
1574
of
consolidated
record
roman
numeral
ii.
and
thereafter,
the
intervening
discussion
of
opposition
testimony
and
pro-testimony,
here
is
the
finding
while
the
through
service
over
defendant's
routes,
that's
the
union
pacific's
routes,
in
general
is
a
satisfaction
to
the
shipping
public
as
the
service
which
could
be
provided
over
routes
including
the
rio
grande,
this
is
not
true
with
respect
to
the
commodities
we
have
enumerated.
now,
there's
claim.
well,
there
isn't
time
here
to
show
what
the
evidence
was
on
that
but
there
is
the
claim.
now
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
that's
right.
yes.
now,
i
do
not
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
15
(4),
15
(4)
is
the
statute
which
i
frankly
confessed
in
the
beginning
which
creates
a
monopoly
in
behalf
of
a
railroad
in
connection
with
the
privilege
of
preserving
its
long-haul.
but
15
(4)
has
nothing
to
do,
the
matter
of
establishing
new
through
routes
under
the
restrictions
therein
contained.
i
submit
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
in
the
colorado
case.
and
so,
i
would
like
to
go
to
that
situation
and
in
the
brief
time
at
my
disposal
attempt
to
clear
up,
if
not,
the
point
of
view
of
others
at
least
to
present
clearly
the
point
of
view
of
the
rio
grande
because
this
question
of
through
routes
was
concededly
the
first
and
paramount
issue
in
this
litigation.
the
rio
grande
had
an
unquestioned
right
under
the
statutes
to
resort
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
asked
for
a
decision
upon
this
allegation
that
through
routes
were
in
existence.
not
that
they
were
to
be
established
under
15
(4).
that
wasn't
the
complaint.
the
action
went
off
on
that
later.
but
the
through
routes
were
actually
in
existence.
now,
there
were
two
prongs
to
that,
not
one
but
two.
first
of
all,
that
through
routes
had
been
established
and
competitive
joint
rates
had
been
established
admittedly
when
we
were
operating
in
relation
with
the
oregon
short
line
and
the
(inaudible)
and
then
when
the
union
pacific
took
over
control
of
those
routes,
it
cancelled
only
the
competitive
joint
rate
and
never
made
a
notation
on
the
tariff
or
never
put
anybody
on
notice
or
ever
suggested
that
the
through
routes
were
cancelled
or
were
intended
to
be
cancelled.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
i
think
so,
your
honor.
now,
how
are
we
met
and
i'm
still
on
the
first
form,
not
on
the
question
of
user
at
all,
not
on
the
question
of
shipments
which
is
there
theretofore
to
this
problem.
we
are
met
in
this
case
by
the
statement
that
because
there
was
a
higher
rate,
the
routes
were
commercially
(inaudible)
now,
i
submit
that
this
court
has
settled
that
question.
in
the
great
northern
case
and
in
the
virginia
case
and
another
cases
that
the
formula,
and
that's
how
simple
it
is
and
the
union
pacific's
defense
that
the
mere
possession
of
a
higher
rate
automatically
close
the
through
routes.
of
course
the
commercial
deterrent
kept
the
shipments
down.
the
wonder
is
we
had
55
cars
in
the
typical
year.
we
only
use
the
typical
year
48.
the
wonder
is
that
there
were
enough
shippers
willing
to
pay
that
higher
rate.
it
wouldn't
have
been
much
longer
if
we'd
only
had
10
cars.now,
on
these
government
shipments,
there's
a
point
there
to
be
cleared
up.
yes,
these
shipments
were
under
service
orders.
what
a
service
order
merely
compels
the
carrier
to
take
the
shipment,
it
doesn't
compel
it
to
settle
that
competitive
joint
rates
which
the
union
pacific
did
on
those
shipments
and
they
were
perfectly
willing
it
took
no
compulsion
when
19,000
cars
were
shifted
from
western
pacific,
it's
one
of
our
allied
lines
in
southern
and
they
took
them
over.
they
took
them
over
on
a
through
route
basis.
in
other
words,
required
to
take
them
but
they
weren't
required
to
take
them
on
a
through
route
basis.
and
if
there
was
no
through
route
then
if
you
look
at
section
15
(4),
you'll
find
that
the
commission
has
the
power
in
any
emergency
if
there
is
no
through
route
to
establish
a
temporary
through
route
for
that
emergency.
and
so,
the
commission
itself
recognized
when
it
merely
enter
--
issued
a
service
order
that
the
through
routes
were
there
unavailable
and
could
be
used.
now,
that's
one
form
of
it,
i
say,
and
we
might
stand
on
that
alone
and
not
be
compelled
to
show
any
shipments
at
all.
what
the
other
form
is
this
question
of
user
and
of
holding
out
and
we're
told
that
it's
not
realistic
because
the
union
pacific
never
went
out
or
actively
solicited
traffic.
does
anyone
suppose
down
here,
where
we
have
through
routes,
why
user's
consent
that
the
union
pacific
ever
goes
above
the
prospective
costumers
in
that
area
and
urge
--
assumed
to
ship
over
the
rio
grande?
you
don't
have
to
have
active
solicitation.
what
is
a
holding
out?
as
we
stated
in
our
brief,
the
merchant
on
the
street
who
has
his
door
open
for
business
is
holding
out.
he
doesn't
need
to
go
out
into
the
street
and
urge
costumers
to
come
in
to
his
shop.
a
holding
out
is
merely
being
open
for
business
on
a
certain
basis
and
the
union
pacific
and
all
its
trade
officers
have
been
open
for
business
on
a
through
route
basis
and
never
have
they
refused
to
issue
a
through
bill
of
lading.
now,
may
i
clear
up
another
matter?
mr.
justice
harlan
has
been
interested
in
this
question
of
2011
and
mr.
collins
said,
as
i
understood
him,
that
under
2011,
a
railroad
is
compelled
to
issue
a
through
bill
of
lading.
on
--
of
you
return
to
our
brief.
at
page
47,
our
opening
brief,
you'll
find
this
section
is
discussed
and
i
think
carefully,
2011
requires
--
and
that's
basically
a
section
so
that
the
shipper
will
have
a
receipt
and
he
can
sue
for
damages,
for
negligence
and
other
matters.
and
so,
the
section
does
provide
that
a
common
carrier
must
give
a
receipt
or
a
bill
of
lading
but
it
does
not
say
through
bill
of
lading.
and
justice
--
mr.
ginnane
very
frankly
admitted
a
railroad
may
decline
to
which
the
through
bill
of
lading.
now,
in
48
is
the
section
you
were
reaching
for,
if
i
may
say
so,
section
6
(1)
which
empowers
railroads,
in
fact,
requires
railroad
to
publish
these
tariffs
and
it
distinguishes,
as
you
see
on
page
48
of
our
brief,
it
says
that
they
must
publish
the
tariffs
and
they
may
show
when
a
through
route
and
joint
rates
have
been
established.
if
no
joint
rate
or
through
route
has
been
established
if
no
joint
rates
or
through
if
it
has
been
of
service
to
several
carriers
on
such
through
route
so
(inaudible)
and
keep
open
for
the
public
inspection
as
aforesaid
and
so
on.
so
as
mr.
hickey
indicated
in
his
brief
and
he's
much
a
much
abler
commerce
lawyer
than
i
pretend
to
be,
mr.
hickey
in
his
little
brief
for
the
american
short
line
railroad
association
has
fully
explained,
i
believe,
this
whole
situation
of
how
a
railroad,
by
filing
a
tariff
if
it
wants
to
also
cancel
the
through
routes
may
do
so.
if
it
does
then
some
shipper
and
interested
party
may
come
in.
now,
it
has
been
said
here
that
this
is
a
question
of
fact,
this
question
of
the
existence
of
through
route.
yes,
it's
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
through
routes
were
ever
established
there
and
compared
to
the
joint
rate,
but
i
submit
to
you
as
this
case
reached
the
colorado
court,
it
was
not
a
question
of
fact.
it
was
strictly
a
question
of
law
because
there
was
no
disagreement
at
all
on
the
basic
fact,
and
i
don't
think
it
will
--
quite
true
to
say
if
i
may
say
so
that
there
must
have
been
something
in
the
nature
of
a
motion
here,
mr.
justice
reed,
where
a
decision
was
reached.
we
were
entitled
to
a
decision
on
that
question,
not
if
it
was
merely
an
administrative
matter.
what
if
the
facts
were
undisputed?
this
court
has
always
considered
it
a
question
of
law
and
it's
so
admitted
in
the
union
pacific's
brief
or
we
considered
it
a
question
of
law
as
to
whether
through
routes
are
in
existence
or
not.
and
that
brings
us
to
the
thompson
case
and
i
want
to
finish
on
that
note.
in
the
thompson
case,
there
were
no
through
routes
of
any
kind
and
no
shipments
had
ever
gone
forward.
there
was
no
background
that
the
through
route
ever
having
been
established
or
a
competitive
to
a
greater
existence.
and
so,
the
difficulty
here
is
that
this
commission
was
concerned
about
the
thompson
case
and
query
and
this
is
my
last
query,
does
is
take
five
shipments
under
the
thompson
case
or
10
or
50
or
20
or
55?
and
whatever
result
comes
from
this
litigation,
if
i
may
say
so,
whether
rio
grande
prevails
or
union
pacific,
i
think
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
clarify
the
thompson
case
and
make
a
claim
so
that
no
commission
again
divide
by
its
class
on
this
important
issue,
i
think.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
well,
your
honor
may
i
answer
theirs.
they
raised
it
and
i
think
i
should
be
in
the
answering
position
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
e.
holman
i
would
like
very
much
to
do
it,
but
i'd
like
to
answer
theirs.
mr.
frank
e.
holman
yes.
