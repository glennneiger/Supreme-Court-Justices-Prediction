justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
--
if
that
is
sustained
in
the
other
cases,
in
fact,
it
wraps
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
add
your
position
if
--
if
that
decree
is
affirmed
here,
then
it
goes
back
to
the
position
under
15
(3)
and
15
(4)
is
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
as
it
goes
back
from
the
15
(3).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
15
(4).
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
appeal
from
the
commission
order
in
the
nebraska
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you're
not
questioning
the
commission
to
limit
--
the
limitations
of
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
just
want
to
clear
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
that's
quite
correct.
now
then,
the
matter
got
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
commission
made
no
such
finding
as
i'm
going
to
show
in
a
moment.
there
was
a
failure.
there
was
a
vote
five-to-five
on
that
question
and
when
i
come
to
argue
the
controverted
issue,
i'm
going
to
point
out
that
there
was
a
total
failure
of
the
commission
to
reach
any
decision
upon
the
basic
point
alleged
in
the
complaint
in
which
all
through
this
case
has
been
considered
the
crucial
question.
i
don't
mind
going
to
that
right
now,
your
honor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
correct.
and
due
to
the
commission's
compulsion
which
the
colorado
court
held
was
an
error
in
law
that
they
could
only
operate
under
15
(4)
and
its
restrictions
and
because
of
those
restrictions,
that's
why
we
don't
get
competitive
joint
rates
there
because
it's
a
restrictive
statute.
now,
the
union
pacific
after
the
commission
decision
and
its
preferred
connections
assailed
the
commission
order
by
filing
their
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska,
omaha
division
claiming
that
the
rio
grande
was
entitled
to
no
relief
of
any
kind.
the
nebraska
courts
sustained
the
order
of
the
commission
in
part
and
overruled
it
in
part.
it
restricted
the
application
of
these
competitive
joint
rates
and
through
routes,
the
shipments
which
would
be
accorded
in-transit
privileges
along
the
rio
grande.
in
other
words,
that
it
was
a
two-shipment
of
potatoes
to
(inaudible)
and
it
wasn't
to
be
unloaded
and
reloaded
or
sorted
which
is
one
of
the
in-transit
privileges
then
under
the
commission
order,
there
is
no
competitive
joint
rates
and
through
routes.
the
omaha
decision
was
a
two-one
decision
and
it
modified
the
commission
order
to
that
extent
by
restricting
it
to
shipments
that
are
to
be
accorded
in
transit
privileges,
and
the
shipper
would
have
to
know
for
he
started
where
he
was
going
to
have
in-transit
privileges
along
the
rio
grande.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
denver
and
rio
grande
is
neutral
in
the
nebraska
proceedings,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
you
came
in
and
then
came
--
it
went
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
well,
i
thought
there
was
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
intervened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
nebraska?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
ask
for
leave
to
withdraw
after
the
meeting
--
never
mind,
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
holman,
does
your
--
clear
up
my
own
confusion,
i'm
looking
at
page
103
of
the
nebraska
record
tell
me
what
the
order
along
the
denver
and
rio
grande
as
to
withdrawing
petition
of
intervention
means,
page
103.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
same
as
the
immaterial,
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
rates
can
we
attach
to
that
testimony
in
view
of
the
explicit
statement
of
the
commission
in
the
first
opinion
or
the
commission
opinions,
if
that's
what
it
is,
that
they
have
not
taken
into
account
the
financial
needs
of
the
rio
grande?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
--
of
course
ipse
dixit
of
the
commission
can't
sustain
a
baseless
finding.
therefore,
i
should
think
our
problem,
my
problem
is,
that
if
the
commission
says
so,
i
must
naturally
give
it
respect,
but
if
the
record
contradicts
it
then
i'll
be
reject
the
conclusion
and
accept
the
record.
now,
is
that
the
situation
from
your
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
trying
--
your
time
is
short,
but
this
is
--
it
seems
to
me
a
very
important
point.
congress
for
including
--
sufficiently
refused,
made
an
important
enactment
or
amendment
in
1940
on
this
very
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
joint
routes,
and
joint
rates
in
order
to
--
for
the
financial
need
of
another
road.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
railroad
is
not
a
mercenary
institution
and
the
central
rio
grande
wouldn't
have
brought
this
complaint
before
the
commission
unless
it
wanted
to
make
some
money
out
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
but
is
that
--
[laughs]
therefore,
it
can't
be
that
merely
because
it
will
be
profitable
to
a
road,
you
have
joint
route
which
it
seeks
with
the
commission
that
that
disable
the
commission
from
granting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
this
amendment
seems
to
me,
rather
crucial
to
this
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
being
specific
isn't
trying
to
sustain
this
order
as
a
mean
of
preventing
or
correcting,
violation
of
other
provisions
of
the
act,
is
it
or
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
then
the
rio
grande
which
is
not
right
to
sustain
this
order
as
a
mean
of
correcting
other
established
by
--
violations
of
other
provisions
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let's
take
it
apart
from
them.
the
district
court
of
nebraska,
did
it
sustain
in
a
bona
fide
way
in
which
it
did,
the
commission's
order
as
a
means
of
correcting
violations,
say
of
section
3?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
suggesting
that
there
are
no
specific
findings
and
we
have
to
excavate
from
this
long
report
what
may
be
attributable
to
the
commission
as
its
findings,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
there
are
no
findings
such
as
are
required
by
the
rules
that
courts
could
make,
and
the
findings
are
embedded
in
the
totality
of
their
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
we
not
blame
for
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
actually
making
(inaudible)
of
these,
i
mean,
in
point,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
make
(inaudible),
does
it
--
i
mean,
these
points.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
judge
johnsen
called
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
pertain
particularly
as
to
your
shipments
from
the
northwest
which
also
apply
to
shipments
to
the
northwest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
beside,
if
the
shipper
doesn't
indicate
over
what
route
it
goes,
the
carrier
could
choose
the
route,
whichever
way
he
chooses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
--
did
the
district
court
find
any
violation
of
section
3?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
did
they
find
a
violation
of
3
(1)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
there
--
i
ought
to
know
what
i
don't,
that
cross-appeal
by
the
union
pacific
in
that
omaha
court
did
not
so
find?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
their
cross-appeal
as
to
a
violation
of
section
3?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
adverse
to
what?
i
haven't
made
myself
clear.
the
district
court
in
nebraska
did
not
find
a
violation
of
section
3,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
november,
what's
in
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
union
pacific
cross-appealed
on
the
failure
to
find
--
the
failure
by
the
district
court
to
find
a
violation
in
section
3
apart
from
that
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
the
(inaudible)
--
i'm
sorry,
i
mixed
my
(inaudible)
rio
grande?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
this
is
before
us,
you
needn't
argue
it,
it's
because
it's
--
it's
the
challenge
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
both
--
the
both
--
both
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
each
of
the
five
except
of
the
thompson
case
test
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
each
of
the
two-five?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
was
the
determination
by
the
respective
five
that
it
did
or
didn't
fall
within
an
accepted
and
acknowledged
test.
and
that
is
a
question
of
fact
rather
than
a
question
of
law,
isn't
it?
now,
the
court
of
appeals
--
are
we
to
make
this
determination
of
facts?
this
isn't
just
a
--
just
a
subtle
dialectic
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
suggest
that
that's
to
the
other
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
it
must
have
implied
the
facts
on
it
on
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
refusal
to
operate
as
though
through
existence
that
you
will
prove
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ginnane,
may
i
revert
to
justice
reed's
earlier
question?
in
the
course
of
your
reply
you
said
that
the
commission
was
divided
5-to-5.
now,
let
me
clear
up
in
my
mind.
the
commission
was
divided
5-to-5
in
the
matter
that's
before
it
then
before
its
divided
5-to-5,
the
claims
of
the
denver
&
rio
grande
that
there
was
an
existing
route
did
not
prevail,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thereupon,
the
denver
&
rio
grande
--
what
preceded
before
the
colorado
district
court
to
enjoin
that
order
claiming
error
and
that
it
did
not
find
a
through
route.
but
in
that
proceeding,
the
commission
evidently
upholds
the
denver
&
rio
grande.
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
therefore,
the
commission
before
the
denver
court
took
the
position,
not
5-to-5
but
as
a
body,
as
a
litigant,
that
there
wasn't
a
through
route.
and
the
case
then
came
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
the
joint
brief
of
the
united
states,
the
commission
and
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
you
want
all
three,
the
government
and
litigant,
wants
that
decree
of
the
denver
court
reversed.
so,
i
don't
understand
what
this
5-to-5
clause
is
except
that
it
shed
illumination
on
what
the
commission
had
thought
but
so
far
as
the
position
of
the
government
and
the
icc
and
the
department
of
agriculture
is
concerned,
you
are
here
urging
this
court
there
was
error
on
the
part
of
denver
court.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
i
raise
the
question
is
because
in
your
answer
to
justice
harlan
yesterday
when
he
asked
you
what
the
question
was
or
what
you
represented
the
position
of
the
commission,
you
said
was
commendable
candor
or
appropriate
candor
--
candor
appropriate
on
the
part
of
(inaudible)
they
probably
get
credit
for.
but
that's
so
difficult
to
perhaps,
a
doubtful
question
on
which
you
cared
for,
take
a
dogmatic
position.
i
take
it
that
the
commission
is
here
taking
a
dogmatic
position.
by
dogmatic
meaning
if
it's
such
a
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
suggest
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you
moved
away,
the
commission
has
moved
away
from
5-to-5
as
an
affirmative
commission
here
as
part
of
its
position,
if
i
may
quote
eminent
authority,
a
positive
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
that
there
is
no
or
there
was
no
rule
of
(inaudible)
that's
correct
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
--
i
take
it
that
when
the
commission
appeared
in
court,
whether
the
division
in
court
or
this
court,
is
the
commission's
action
not
merely
counsel
but
the
commission
that
is
authorizing
one
position
rather
than
another,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
agree
with
that
at
all.
if
i
understand
the
situation,
the
fact
that
five
can
find
one
way
and
five
can
find
other
way
doesn't
prove
a
difference
in
standards,
it
proves
a
difference
in
applications
of
the
standard,
namely,
whether
the
fact
is
printed
within
the
standard.
as
i
read
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
read
the
--
all
the
opinions
of
the
icc,
they
all
rested
on
what
was
laid
down
in
thompson.
there
was
no
difference
of
view
as
to
what
is
to
be
applied
but
in
applying,
it
gave
us
a
different
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
members
of
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
reach
a
different
conclusion
on
the
same
record
of
borrowing
the
same
standard
to
be
applied
to
the
same
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
truth
--
it
is
true
to
admit
that
through
billing
is
also
important
to
shippers,
wholly
apart
from
a
joint
rate.
the
--
the
service
through
billing
afford
advantages
to
a
shipper,
wholly
apart
from
the
--
the
case
quoted
by
the
chief
justice
earlier.
it
may
be
willing
to
pay
more,
to
possess
the
advantages
especially
in
private
advantages
but
it
is
a
nuisance
to
have
to
get
separate
billings
at
each
particular
permit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
through
billing
apart
from
joint
rate
is
a
factor
in
a
joint
route
in
a
--
in
a
through
route,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
about
this
part
generally.
through
billing
is
a
factor
in
--
in
transportation's
affair,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
that
come
under
the
statute,
in
1940?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
still
further
restricted
the
mitigating
or
relieving
power
of
the
commission.
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
the
whole
--
the
whole
--
the
government
knows
that
the
legislature
or
as
to
protect
against
short-hauling,
does
that
it
bears
suddenly
in
the
course
of
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
thing
--
well,
i
haven't
read
the
evidence
to
where
--
i
haven't
read
the
evidence
but
how
did
that
get
into
the
case
if
the
question
of
needs
--
of
the
railroad's
needs,
financial
needs,
wasn't
interfered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
first
the
--
i'm
referring
to
your
statement
that
says
but
to
which
i
got
the
impression
that
the
evidence
of
the
record,
of
the
rest
of
evidence
dealing
with
the
financial
conditions
of
the
route,
particularly
the
denver
&
rio
grande
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
now
say
that
the
union
pacific
said,
we
are
in
greater
need,
don't
take
away
our
--
don't
divert
traffic
from
us
because
we
--
we
have
more
greater
need
of
revenue
than
the
--
than
the
rio
grande
in
which
i
might
jump
to
the
conclusion
quite
too
hastily
that
there
must
have
been
some
discussions
of
financial
needs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
how
much?
if
i
went
through
the
record,
what
would
i
find
on
that
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
the
financial
of
the
denver
&
rio
grande,
it
was
a
matter
of
corporate
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
--
private
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
icc
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
reading
in
this
court
of
the
investigation
order
for
the
matters
that
come
before
it
on
that
subject,
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
a
good
deal
of
that
regarding
the
denver
&
rio
grande
in
this
very
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
any
of
the
--
who
operated
in
the
northwest
as
parties
before
the
commission
in
your
present
shipper's
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
mr.
ginnane,
the
counsel
for
the
department
of
agriculture
joined
the
party
to
your
brief
in
asking
that
the
judgment
of
the
colorado
district
court
should
be
reversed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
adequate
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
doesn't
that
--
doesn't
that
make
you
encompassed,
judge
johnson,
opposition,
that
that
would
allow
every
other
that
would
always
allow
another
route
that
is
available
to
be
opened
up
and
thereby
this
short-haul
existing.
certainly,
if
you
got
another
one
then
there
must
be
conditions
like
that
throughout
the
country.
it's
always
better
to
have
another
--
another
--
what
do
you
call
this,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
mean
needed
--
when
you
mean
needed,
it
would
be
cheaper
for
them
to
do
it
that
way
or
more
advantageous,
is
it
not,
but
it
isn't
adequate
from
the
point
of
view
of
transportation.
i
suggest
that
judge
johnson's
argument
can't
be
met
by
that
if
it's
remarking
but
by
--
that's
always
when
you
have
another
one
with
this
particularly
wanted
in
this
case
where
you
--
where
you
have
the
other
routes
available
that
is
shorter
or
longer,
slower
and
all
the
other
disadvantages
than
what
rio
grande
has
over
the
great
union
pacific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
they
couldn't
get
to
the
market
but
to
say
to
get
to
the
market
with
certain
advantages
of--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it
was
added
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
prohibitive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
the
union
pacific.
you
take
the
monument
(inaudible)
would
have
element
of
humor
about
it
i
think
that
there
two
films
with
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
it
--
whom
you
saw
a
vegetable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
the
livestock
can't
get
to
where
there'll
be
--
where
they
might
have
a
market
merely
means
that
they've
had
a
medium
market,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
please,
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
collins,
tell
us
the
precise
words
in
the
tariffs
that
were
in
existence
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
before
the
commission,
the
precise
words
out
of
the
union
pacific
tariffs
filed
to
the
commission
referring
to
the
acceptance
of
shipment
that
also
go
with
the
rio
grande.
what
are
the
exact
words
of
the
tariff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
difficulty
in
time,
perhaps
you
--
with
the
chief
justice's
permission,
give
us
a
memorandum.
i
would
like
to
know
exactly
what
this
tariff
stated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
rather
than
to
this
litigation
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
does
it
say?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
produce
a
memorandum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
--
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
the
tariff
stated
on
this
question,
namely,
that
the
tariffs
in
mr.
holman's
suggestion
because
the
tariff
invited
business
to
where
a
man
doesn't
have
a
shoe
store
where
there
have
never
been
a
shop.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
has
that
been
the
formula
ever
since
your
cancelation
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough.
i
think
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
it
doesn't
say
anything
except
what
you
read,
is
that
