mr.
milton
c.
denbo
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
going
to
present
the
argument
for
king
edward
and
budd
and
mr.
hughes
will
present
the
argument
for
the
may
tobacco
company.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
clarify,
since
there's
--
there's
been
some
confusion
on
this
point
precisely
what
the
contentions
here
are.
king
edward
insists
or
contends
that
the
employees
and
its
packing
plant
in
quincy
are
within
the
exemption
which
section
13
(a)
(6)
of
the
act
grants
to
employees
employed
in
agriculture
as
that
term
is
defined
in
section
3
(f).
the
budd
company,
as
ms.
margolin
has
several
times
stated,
does
not
claim
that
this
exemption
applies.
if
in
fact
the
court
agrees
with
the
holding
of
the
court
below
that
the
agricultural
exemption
does
apply
to
the
packing
plant
of
king
edward
then
that
disposes
of
a
case
as
far
as
king
edward
is
concerned.
it
is
only
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
contention
that
our
next
inordinate
contention
arises
which
is
that
under
section
13
(a)
(10)
of
the
act,
the
employees
and
king
edward's
packing
plant
are
engaged
in
performing
operations
which
are
described
in
that
section,
that
the
administrator's
definition
of
area
of
production
insofar
as
it
contains
a
population
limitation
is
unauthorized
and
that
until
the
administrator
does
issue
a
valid
definition
excluding
the
employees
at
king
edward's
packing
plant,
he's
not
entitled
to
the
injunction
in
which
he
sought
here
in
the
district
court.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
was
about
to
say
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
that's
true
--
that's
true.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
just
stated
for
me,
as
far
as
budd
is
concerned,
the
section
13
(a)
(10)
exemption
is
the
one
which
we
claim
applies
to
its
employees
and
it's
the
only
claim
we
have
with
respect
to
budd.
i'd
like
to
state
that
so
far
as
the
section
13
(a)
(6)
exemption
is
concerned
contrary
to
a
statement
ms.
margolin
made
yesterday
that
is
an
exemption
only
from
the
wage
and
hour
provisions
of
the
act.
it
is
true
that
there
is
also
an
exemption
in
another
section
of
the
act
from
the
child
labor
provisions
for
employees
and
agriculture
when
outside
of
school
hours.
that's
in
section
13
(c)
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case
and
serves
a
totally
different
purpose.
there
is
no
child
labor
problem
involved
here
nor
does
the
section
upon
which
we
rely
grant
any
exemption
from
the
child
labor
provisions.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i'm
about
to
state
the
facts
in
the
king
edward
case,
sir,
mr.
justice
reed,
if
i
may.
now,
with
this
explanation
as
to
our
contentions,
i
would
like
now
because
i
do
not
believe
that
the
facts
as
to
the
operations
of
the
packing
plants
here
had
been
fully
stated,
set
forth
what
we
regard
as
the
salient
facts
in
the
king
edward
case.
king
edward
operates
farms
in
the
gadsden
county,
florida
on
which
it
grows
under
cheesecloth
shade,
united
states
type
62
tobacco.
this
type
of
tobacco
is
grown
only
in
three
counties
in
florida
and
in
two
adjacent
counties
in
georgia
and
nowhere
else
in
the
world
except
in
--
in
consequential
amounts.
when
the
tobacco
leaves
are
harvested,
they
are
carried
immediately
to
curing
barns
located
on
the
farm.
there,
they
are
hang
on
sticks
to
dry,
permitted
to
absorb
moisture
and
then
re-dried.
after
the
tobacco
turns
into
a
shade
of
brown,
it
is
packed
loosely
in
boxes
and
carried
to
king
edward's
packing
plant
here
involved,
located
in
quincy,
about
13
miles
from
the
farms.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
don't
believe
the
--
the
record
shows,
mr.
justice
reed,
and
i
frankly
don't
know.
it's
four
to
six
weeks,
i
believe.
i
don't
think
the
record
does
indicate
how
long
it
hangs.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
it
goes
to
a
curing
on
the
barn.
i
don't
like
to
characterize
it
as
the
first
curing
because
as
i'll
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
goes
through
a
curing.
i'll
state
in
a
moment.
that's
all
part
of
a
continuos
process
which
results
in
this
fermented
tobacco.
the
--
when
the
tobacco
arrives
at
the
packing
plant,
it
is
piled
in
bulks
on
the
floor.
and
in
answer
to
a
question
to
mr.
justice
clark,
whatever
heating
equipment
there
is
in
the
plant
is
just
equipment
which
heats
the
entire
plant,
not
anything
which
is
specifically
in
there
to
heat
the
bulks.
the
entire
fermentation
operation
is
just,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
found,
a
natural
process.
during
a
period
of
about
two
to
four
months,
these
tobacco
leaves
in
the
box
are
shifted
about
in
order
to
air
them
and
in
order
to
make
certain
that
the
changes
in
the
leaves
throughout
the
bulk
will
be
uniform.
after
they've
been
there
for
two
to
four
months,
they
are
sprayed
with
water
to
keep
them
pliable
for
handling.
they
are
thereafter
graded
by
hand
and
then
re-bulked
to
dry
out
for
a
further
period
of
two
to
four
months
after
which
they
are
valid
for
sale
to
the
cigar
manufacturer.
now,
in
king
edwards's
case
the
only
tobacco
that
it
handles
in
this
packing
plant
is
tobacco
it
grows
itself
on
its
farms.
as
we
see
them,
the
--
there
are
several
facts
which
i
think
should
be
emphasized.
first,
the
transfer
of
the
leaves
from
the
barns,
the
packing
plant,
must
be
prompt
in
order
to
avoid
any
harm
to
the
natural
changes
that
are
taking
place
in
the
leaf.
the
entire
process
of
treating
the
leaf
from
the
time
it
is
hanged
in
the
curing
barns
until
the
fermentation
is
completed
in
the
packing
plant
is
one
continuos
process
of
natural
transformation
within
the
leaf
necessary
to
assure
the
desired
color
and
appearance
of
the
leaf.
the
process
is
a
drying
one
accompanied
by
chemical
changes
which
start
at
the
barn
and
continue
throughout
the
bulk
sweating.
there
is
no
dividing
point
between
the
changes
appearing
at
the
two
places.
second,
the
entire
process
is
completed
without
adding
any
external
or
artificial
element
or
stimulation.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
operation
is
entirely
a
natural
way,
only
the
temperature
and
humidity
are
regulated
both
at
the
barns
and
in
the
packing
plant.
third,
the
bulk
sweating
and
baling
of
a
tobacco
at
the
packing
plant
are
customary
and
essential
operations
to
prepare
king
edward's
tobacco
for
market.
the
court
of
appeals
below
so
found
and
the
record
amply
supports
this
finding.
ms.
margolin
has
a
question
to
some
of
the
assertions
in
our
brief
on
this
subject
in
a
moment
or
two
when
i
get
into
the
legal
argument,
i
shall
answer
some
of
the
things
she
said.
fourth,
the
king
edward's
packing
plant
operations
are
clearly
not
industrialized
and
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
plant
has
extensive
or
expensive
equipment.
now
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
king
edward
does
have
two
other
packing
plants.
the
record
shows
they're
not
involved
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
they
buy
that
after
it's
been
cured
on
the
--
in
--
in
barns
on
the
farm.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
yes.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
said
there's
no
expensive
--
the
record
doesn't
show
any
expensive
equipment
involved
in
the
king
edward
packing
plant.
in
this
matter
of
actual
fact,
the
district
court
virtually
so
found.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
she's
talking
about
the
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
she's
--
she
was
speaking
about
budd.
i'm
talking
about
king
edward
now.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
as
i
--
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
but
i'll
answer
that
right
now,
chief
justice
warren.
the
--
the
record
does
show
that
budd
does
have
equipment
and
it's
characterized
as
expensive
equipment
and
a
request
for
admission
that
budd
made
in
which
the
government
answered
yes.
but
when
you
examine
that,
you
find
that
the
only
equipment
they're
talking
about
there
is
equipment
for
humidifying
and
temperature
control.
i'd
like
to
read
that,
if
i
may.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
are
you
talking
about
king
edward?
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
they
were
paying
75
cents
an
hour
in
the
other
client,
yes.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
other
than
the
one
involved
here.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
that
was
the
law
--
what
the
law
--
that
was
the
requirement
at
the
time,
yes.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no
--
no.
i
was
going
to
read
to
you
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
it's
on
page
42
of
the
budd
record.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
the
record
in
the
budd
case,
each
has
the
same
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
color
but
on
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
on
page
42.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
it
starts
with
the
words,
"that
the
bulking
and
handling
to
be
successfully
and
efficiently
and
economically
carried
out
requires
a
tremendously
large
amount
of
equipment,
including
a
steam-heated
packing
house
equipped
with
humidifying
sprays,
bulking
platforms,
casing
machinery
and
sprays,
thermometers
and
thermometer
tubes,
bulk
covers,
baling
boxes
and
presses,
wax
paper,
baling
mats,
packing,
sorting
and
grading
tables."
now,
i
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
--
that
is
nothing
more
than
a
description
of
the
humidifying
machinery
as
the
district
court
said.
the
district
court
had
that
before
it
and
characterized
this
as
machinery
for
humidifying
and
controlling
the
temperature
of
the
plant.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
oh,
i
won't
deny
that.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
my
point
is
that
i
would
hardly
characterize
a
plant
containing
this
type
of
equipment
as
a
industrialized
plant
and
on
that
very
point
i've
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
chief
justice
warren,
i'm
unable
to
answer
the
question
because
i
didn't
handle
this
case
for
budd
in
the
district
court
and
i
think
it
was
probably
uncalled
for.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
it
doesn't
show
what
is
in
the
king
edward
plant.
of
my
own
knowledge
i
think
it
is
probably
substantially
the
same.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
the
judge
--
if
you
will
look
at
his
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
opinion
which
appears
in
--
it
was
king
edward
record
at
page
76.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
in
a
supplemental
opinion,
he
said
--
i'm
sorry,
it's
on
page
75.
he
says,
“this
statement
may
be
accurate
as
to
the
case
made
out
by
king
edward."
meaning
in
the
statement
that
it
doesn't
have
any
equipment
for
appropriate
humidification
and
curing
the
tobacco.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
on
page
75,
your
honor.
if
you'll
notice
there's
a
roman
numeral
ii
and
then
the
next
paragraph
starts.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
those
are
the
king
edward
record
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
oh,
yes.
he
said
the
statement
may
be
accurate
as
to
the
case
made
out
by
king
edward
but
upon
the
whole
record
before
the
court,
it
clearly
and
very
definitely
occurred
that
the
packing
houses
are
equipped
with
machinery
for
the
appropriate
humidification
and
curing
the
tobacco
and
no
harm
is
done
to
king
edward
by
retaining
this
language
in
memorandum
decision.
i'd
like
to
say
also,
your
honor,
that
i
don't
regard
the
fact
that
the
plant
may
be
--
may
have
equipment
as
really
of
a
great
materiality
in
determining
whether
the
agricultural
exemption
applies.
this
court
said
as
much
in
waialua
case.
it
said
it
in
just
those
words
that
no
matter
how
mechanized
or
industrialized
the
plant
may
be,
it's
still
is
within
the
exemption
if
it
falls
otherwise
within
the
language
and
purpose
of
the
exemption.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
within
the
language
which
is
preparation
for
market,
delivery
to
storage,
delivery
to
market
and
delivery
to
carriers
for
transportation
to
market,
examples
of
practices
incidental
to
or
in
conjunction
with
farming
operations.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
oh,
yes.
i
recognized
that
the
court
listed
this
as
a
possible
factor
in
the
waialua
decision.
but
it
also
specifically
indicated
that
it
would
not
be
controlling
by
any
means.
in
connection
with
this
in
very
matter
as
to
how
industrialized
these
plants
are,
we
referred
in
our
briefs
to
various
department
of
agriculture
publications
and
i
have
deposited
with
the
clerk
for
the
court's
convenience
two
of
these
department
of
agriculture
publications
and
i
like
to
call
attention
to
certain
figures
which
appear
on
pages
49
and
84
of
circular
249
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
which
figures
show
quiet
clearly
how
unskilled
really
the
work
involved
here
is
and
how
these
are
hardly
plants
that
one
would
characterize
as
huge
industrialized
plants
like
for
example
the
sugar
mill
that
was
involved
in
the
waialua
case.
this
is
nothing
like
that
whatsoever.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
size
also
as
the
court
said
in
that
case.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
it
is
not
controlling.
now,
finally,
as
very
material
fact
here
is
the
fact
that
the
employees
at
the
packing
plant
are
about
the
same
as
those
who
work
earlier
in
the
year
in
planting,
growing,
harvesting
and
barn
curing
the
tobacco.
ms.
margolin
is
completely
in
error
in
stating
that
we
erroneously
said
that
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
the
record
fully
supports
our
statement
to
that
effect.
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
point
out
the
particular
places
in
the
record
which
clearly
support
it,
including
findings
of
both
the
district
court
upon
which
she
relies
heavily
and
similar
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals.
but
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
if
any
are
included
in
its
opinion,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
and
it
said
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
i'm
--
i'm
perfectly
happy
to
be
bound
by
those
findings.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
the
district
court
said
specifically
that
a
majority
of
the
--
of
the
workers
in
the
packing
plant
work
at
other
times
of
the
year
on
the
farms.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
again,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
in
the
waialua
you'll
refer
to
the
factor
of
whether
the
employees
interchange
between
the
farms
and
the
packing
plant
as
a
factor
to
determine
the
application
of
the
exemption.
it's
only
for
that
reason
that
i
mentioned
it.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
oh,
yes.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
that's
what
you
held
in
--
in
the
waialua
case
--
that
was
--
was
held
in
the
waialua
case.
now,
directing
myself
to
the
exemption
for
agriculture
or
employees
employed
in
agriculture,
we
submit
that
the
language
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i'm
talking
about
section
(3)
(f)
now
which
defines
agriculture.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
3
(f).
you'll
find
that
set
forth
in
--
on
page
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
95
of
our
brief.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i'm
talking
about
sections

13(a)
(6)
exempts
employees
employed
in
agriculture
and
section
3
(f)
defines
the
word
agriculture.
we
submit
the
language,
the
legislative
history,
the
controlling
case
law,
including
waialua
and
the
published
and
outstanding
administrative
interpretations
of
the
department
of
labor
all
show
that
the
employees
of
king
edward
here
when
engaged
at
its
packing
plant
in
handling
and
preparing
for
market,
only
the
tobacco
which
king
edward
grows
on
its
farms
are
exempted.
taking
up
first
the
statutory
language,
section
3
(f),
defining
agriculture
is
divided
into
two
distinct
branches.
the
first
branch
sets
forth
what
this
court
is
characterized
as
the
primary
meaning
of
agriculture,
farming
and
all
its
branches,
cultivation
and
tillage
of
the
soil,
production,
cultivation,
growing
and
harvesting
of
agricultural
commodities.
then
there
is
a
second
distinct
branch,
agriculture
in
which
this
court
has
called
the
broader
meaning.
agriculture
includes
practices
whether
or
not
themselves
farming
practices
performed
either
by
a
farmer
or
on
a
farm
as
an
incident
to
or
in
conjunction
with
farming
operations
including
--
i
should
have
said
in
conjunction
with
such
farming
operations,
including
preparation
for
market,
delivery
to
storage,
delivery
to
market,
delivery
to
carriers
for
transportation
to
market.
now,
king
edward
is
a
farmer
conducting
the
farming
operation
as
listed
in
the
statutory
definition
of
producing,
cultivating,
harvesting
and
agricultural
commodity.
and
so
far
as
its
packing
plant
activities
are
concerned
of
bulking,
sorting
and
baling
the
tobacco,
they,
we
submit,
constitute
practices
performed
by
king
edward,
a
farmer
as
an
incident
to
or
in
conjunction
with
its
farming
operations,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
facts
that,
first,
it
does
this
work
only
with
respect
to
the
tobacco
it
grows
itself.
secondly,
the
activities
of
its
packing
plant
employees
as
found
below
are
essential
to
prepare
the
tobacco
for
market.
and
third,
the
preparation
of
the
tobacco
from
the
time
it's
first
hung
in
the
curing
barn
until
the
fermentation
is
completed
and
the
packing
takes
place
in
the
packing
plant
is
one
continuous
and
integrated
process
largely
performed
by
the
same
employees
who
grow
and
harvest
the
tobacco
on
king
edward's
farms.
these
operations,
we
say,
come
within
the
words
preparation
for
market
which
appear
in
the
statutory
definition
as
an
example
of
the
incidental
and
conjunctive
practices
congress
meant
to
exempt.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
oh,
yes.
this
very
record
has
such
a
case,
mr.
justice
reed.
he
sells
it
to
a
packing
plant.
budd
is
such
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
a
packing
plant.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no.
you
mean
the
basis
on
which
the
sellers
made?
the
record
here
is
silent
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
on
that.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
that's
as
to
the
auction
warehouse
which
i'm
going
to
deal
with.
yes,
that
takes
place
in
--
places
like
(inaudible)
like
kentucky.
most
of
the
tobacco
in
this
country
is
sold
that
way
but
not
this
particular
tobacco.
here,
the
--
the
record
doesn't
show
and
i'm
advised
by
the
people
in
the
industry
that
the
farmer
may
make
an
arrangement
in
advance
with
a
particular
plant,
under
which
that
plant
will
finance
him
or
he
doesn't
need
financing.
he'll
have
the
tobacco
prepared
and
he'll
carry
it
to
the
packing
plant
and
they
may
take
that
tobacco
on
a
50/50
basis
with
him
or
they
may
take
that
tobacco
and
for
a
fee,
sweat
it
for
him
and
then
return
it
to
him
or
they
take
it,
they
grade
it,
determine
what
the
price
will
be,
pay
in
that
price
after
deducting
certain
expenses
and
that's
that.
it's
not
in
--
in
a
variety
of
ways.
they
don't
normally,
as
i'm
told,
send
people
around
on
farms
to
look
over
the
--
that
the
--
the
crop
as
it's
grown.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
the
farmer
takes
then
himself.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
you
grade
it
after
it's
been
docked
in
the
packing
plant.
there's
a
finding
to
that
effect
in
this
record,
mr.
justice
clark
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
the
court
of
appeals
so
said.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
said
so
on
page
92
of
the
king
edward
record.
the
court
of
appeals
said
primarily
because
it
cannot
be
graded
until
it's
been
processed.
there's
no
market
as
an
earlier
stage
for
this
type
of
tobacco.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no.
they
sometimes
do
that,
mr.
justice
clark,
as
--
as
matter
of
fact.
that
is
not
the
usual
practice.
when
a
man
brings
in
his
tobacco,
these
tobacco
experts,
i'm
advised,
can
tell
immediately
if
it
looks
like
a
very
outstanding
crop.
if
it
does,
they'll
pay
him
off
immediately.
the
usual
practice
is
to
pay
him
after
the
tobacco
has
been
graded.
that's
not
in
the
record.
it's
not
in
the
record
--
i
--
at
all.
the
fact
that
he's
paid
after
it's
been
graded.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
this
subject
at
all.
this
operation,
i
repeat,
of
preparing
this
tobacco
in
the
packing
plant,
we
feel
quite
strongly,
falls
within
the
example
given
in
the
statute
of
incidental
and
conjunctive
practices
of
a
farmer,
namely,
preparation
for
market.
we
say
that
preparation
for
market
with
respect
to
type
62
tobacco
must
mean
the
operation
here,
they,
being
the
preparatory
operations
upon
this
tobacco
before
it's
marketed
by
king
edward.
now,
on
the
question
of
--
of
whether
in
fact
these
operations
are
essential
to
prepare
the
tobacco
for
market,
i
might
say
first
that
so
long
as
we
establish
that
in
fact
king
edward
is
doing
this
work
upon
its
tobacco
in
preparing
it
for
market,
i
don't
think
it
makes
too
much
difference
whether
in
fact
this
work
can
be
characterized
as
--
as
essential
to
get
the
tobacco
ready
for
market.
but
the
fact
remains
that
in
this
very
record
we
have
findings
that
this
is
customary
and
essential
work
to
prepare
king
edward's
tobacco
fro
market.
moreover,
the
district
court,
upon
which
ms.
margolin
relies
so
heavily,
itself
called
this
work
preparation
for
market.
in
the
king
edward
record
at
page
59,
the
district
court
said,
"the
process
of
growing,
harvesting
and
drying
this
tobacco
in
the
barns
on
the
farms
where
the
tobacco
was
grown
and
in
bulking,
curing
and
preparing
the
tobacco
for
market
in
the
packing
house
was
the
same
as
that
generally
outlined
heretofore."
they
called
it
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i'm
going
to
come
to
that
in
just
--
just
a
couple
of
moments,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
realized
yesterday
you
said
that
you
thought
--
you
asked
ms.
margolin
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
you
asked
ms.
margolin.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
might
also
say
on
this
question
of
whether
this
work
is
essential
to
prepare
the
tobacco
for
market.
this
comprehensive
agriculture
definition
goes
far
beyond
readying
something
for
market,
the
language
upon
which
the
government
relies
in
this
supplemental
appendix
they
filed
from
a
department
of
agriculture
publication,
which
publication,
i
might
add,
may
or
may
not
have
any
application
to
the
case
here.
we
don't
know.
it
certainly
can't
be
permitted
to
impeach
findings
which
appear
in
the
record
with
respect
to
this
particular
case
and
operation.
but
that
comprehensive
language
goes
way
beyond
readying
for
market.
it
includes
such
things
as
delivery
to
market,
delivery
to
carriers
who
catch
fish
in
the
market,
things
that
take
place
up
to
the
point
where
the
farmer
disposes
of
his
product.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
this
agricultural
exemption,
we
submit,
fairly
and
reinforces
the
conclusion
that
these
operations
are
within
the
statutory
language.
congress
started
with
a
very
broad
definition
of
agriculture
and
as
it
worked
its
way
through,
the
bill
worked
its
way
through
the
passage,
the
exemption
was
made
more
and
more
inclusive.
congress
made
a
claim
that
it
wished
to
exempt
such
“processing”
operations,
it
used
that
word
processing
in
such
operations
as
(inaudible)
bottling,
apple
packing,
cotton
ginning,
hog
slaughtering
when
performed
by
the
farmer
upon
his
own
produce
and
it
also
made
a
claim
that
it
desired
that
result
regardless
of
the
exemption
status
under
the
act
of
processing
done
by
an
independent
plant
separate
from
the
grower.
it
enacted
section
13
(a)
(10)
to
deal
with
that
latter
situation,
and
i'll
come
to
that
shortly.
i
would
just
like
to
say
this
further
word
about
the
legislative
history.
i
don't
believe
that
any
legislative
history
could
be
much
clearer
on
congressional
intent
to
exempt
such
operations
as
we
have
here
--
as
is
this
legislative
history
and
its
fully
reviewed
in
the
--
in
our
brief.
i
come
now
to
the
cases
and
i'll
take
up
the
question
of
the
waialua
case
right
away.
we
submit
that
the
only
two
decisions
of
the
court
dealing
with
this
agricultural
exemption,
namely,
the
farmers
irrigation
case
and
the
waialua
decision
show
that
the
operations
here
are
exempt
and
for
these
reasons.
the
factors
which
the
court
emphasized
in
the
waialua
case
are
largely
present
here.
the
court
there
indicated
that
virtually
all
forms
of
quasi
industrial
processing
upon
agricultural
commodities
other
than
sugar
milling
are
enumerated
in
section
13
(a)
(10)
and
if
they
are
enumerated
there,
the
implication
of
the
decision
was
there
within
the
agricultural
exemption
when
performed
by
the
farmer
upon
his
own
products.
and
as
we'll
show,
the
operations
that
take
place
here
are
among
those
enumerated
in
13
(a)
(10).
this
is
not
like
sugar
milling
which
is
not
in
13
(a)
(10).
the
operations
here
are
handling,
packing,
storing
and
drying
in
agricultural
commodity.
king
edward's
growing
operation
is
substantial
and
it's
not
a
mere
façade
for
in
otherwise
industrial
operation.
the
product
resulting
from
king
edward's
operations
is
fermented
tobacco
leaf
which
involves
only
natural
changes
in
the
leaf
which
--
this
differs
from
milling
sugar
cane
which
transfers
that
cane
by
a
manufacturing
process.
and
here,
the
same
employees
work
on
the
farm
and
on
the
packing
plant
and
they're
not
typical
factory
workers
but
largely
--
but
unskilled
farmer
--
laborers
largely
engaged
in
manual
work,
the
packing
plant
operation
is
not
industrialized.
these
are
all
the
factors
the
court
--
virtually
all
of
the
factors
the
court
emphasized
in
waialua
as
being
pertinent
to
a
determination
of
whether
the
exemption
applies
but
it
doesn't.
now,
we
say
they're
present
here
even
though
they
were
absent
in
waialua.
now,
the
government
argues
that
there
is
no
exemption
under
this
agricultural
exemption
if
the
operation
is
not
exempt
under
section
13
(a)
(10)
and
they
say
the
operations
here
are
not
exempt
under
13
(a)
(10).
therefore,
they're
not
within
the
agricultural
exemption.
well,
to
this
we
reply
that,
first,
the
operations
here
are
among
those
enumerated
in
13
(a)
(10)
and
secondly,
the
statements
upon
which
the
government
relies
in
the
waialua
case
are
applicable
only
to
sugar
milling
which
this
court
recognized
was
a
unique
boarder
line
case
and
those
statement
cannot
be
given
the
sweeping
construction
for
which
the
government
contends.
for
example,
you
have
ginning
of
cotton
which
is
an
operation
except
under
section
13
(a)
(10)
if
performed
within
the
area
of
production.
well,
obviously,
there
are
some
gins
that
are
not
within
the
area
of
production
and
that
doesn't
mean,
certainly,
that
a
farmer
who
gins
his
own
cotton
isn't
within
the
agricultural
exemption.
this
court
said
otherwise
and
waialua
said
that
such
a
farmer
was.
but
the
government's
argument
would
mean
that
that
person
is
not
exempt
because
there
are
always
some
cotton
gins
that
are
not
within
the
area
of
production
and
therefore
they're
--
the
operation
is
sometimes
not
exempt
under
13
(a)
(10).
we
think
that
the
court
in
waialua
meant
to
apply
the
--
its
decision
there
to
sugar
milling,
a
unique
border
line
case,
i
repeat
to
use
the
language
of
the
--
of
this
court
and
not
generally
to
the
type
of
situation
we
have
involved
here.
now,
the
government
recognized
in
this
very
record.
it
--
it's
been
relying
upon
admissions
and
requests
for
admissions
and
in
this
very
record
it
admitted
that
the
all
embracing
agricultural
exemption
didn't
depend
upon
the
13
(a)
(10)
exemption
for
independent
operators
and
it
repeated
that
in
testimony
before
congress
as
late
as
1949.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
administrative
interpretations
that
are
published
and
outstanding
by
them,
they're
--
they're
original
interpretation
specifically
exempted
the
operation
we
have
here
when
performed
by
a
farmer
upon
his
own
product
and
it's
never
been
changed.
this
case
represents
their
effort
to
change
it.
it's
never
been
changed.
it
was
in
effect
on
the
date
of
the
1949
amendments
and
were
repeated
in
general
terms
by
the
department
of
labor
to
the
house
labor
committee
in
hearings
preceding
the
1949
amendments.
the
government
has
no
support
and
those
amendments
are
otherwise
aren't
overturning
this
interpretation
of
almost
17
years
standing.
this
is
like
the
hauling
of
sugarcane
that
was
involved
in
waialua,
where
their
initial
interpretation
exempted
it,
they
tried
to
say
they
had
changed
it
and
this
court
said
they
had
not,
this
is
precisely
the
same.
the
original
interpretation
which
has
never
been
changed
until
they
brought
this
case
was
that
these
operations
are
exempt.
i
turn
now
to
the
budd
case
and
to
the
argument
on
section
13
(a)
(10)
which
applies
both
to
king
edward
and
budd
if
the
court
does
not
--
of
the
view
that
king
edward
falls
within
the
agricultural
exemption.
the
facts
of
budd's
packing
plant
operation
are
very
much
the
same
as
those
of
king
edward.
the
major
difference
is
that
budd
does
not
grow
its
own
tobacco
rather
it
gets
tobacco
from
farmers
in
the
locality
within
a
radius
of
about
30
miles.
the
--
we've
already
gone
through
the
matter
of
what
the
record
shows
with
respect
to
the
equipment
in
budd's
plant.
the
employees
there
do
work
earlier
in
the
year
harvesting
and
barn
curing
the
tobacco
which
they
thereafter
handle
at
budd's
packing
plant.
now,
the
exemption
under
section
13
(a)
(10)
applies
to
employees
who
meet
three
requirements.
first,
they
must
perform
the
operations
which
are
described
in
that
section.
secondly,
they
must
be
performing
those
operations
for
market.
and
thirdly,
they
must
be
performing
them
in
the
area
of
production
as
defined
by
the
administrator.
as
to
the
first
two
requirements,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
were
satisfied
and
as
to
the
third
requirement,
the
court
of
appeals
--
well,
the
plants
do
satisfy
the
definition
as
to
mileage,
limit
their
distance
from
farms
where
the
tobacco
is
grown
but
they
don't
satisfy
the
population
requirement.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
that
requirement
was
invalid
as
applied
here.
so
far
as
the
for
market
of
limitation
is
concerned,
the
government
does
not
deny
that
the
packing
plant
operation
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
are
you
talking
about
the
area
production
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
don't
mean
anything
but,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
other
than
that
was
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
yes.
but
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no.
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
in
a
footnote
that
the
facts
of
this
case
were
such
as
to
show
the
peculiar
inappropriateness
of
the
2500
population
limitation.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
it's
very
possible.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
i
was
not
going
to
jump
into
that
--
at
this
point,
but
i
shall
do
so.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i'll
do
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
i
don't
necessarily
mean
any
ad
hocness
but
i
do
think
that
it's
very
possible
that
a
2500
population
limitation
might
be
valid
in
some
circumstances
with
respect
to
certain
agricultural
commodities,
not
here.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no.
i'm
not
going
to
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no.
i'm
arguing
that
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
there
were
no
--
within
no
rational
meaning
of
the
term
"area
of
production”
in
this
limitation
apply
here.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
let
me
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
let
me
give
you
the
facts
as
to
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
yes.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
yes.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
administrator
himself
in
his
area
of
production
definition
recognized
the
necessity
for
varying
mileage
distances
depending
upon
various
agricultural
commodities
in
various
operations.
for
tobacco,
the
mileage
distance
is
50
miles,
for
ginning
cotton,
its
10
miles.
it
maybe
--
not
exactly
learned
about
these
various
mileages
but
this
is
the
idea
and
for
fruits
and
vegetables,
15
miles.
also,
he
has
varying
tolerances
for
the
periphery
around
cities
or
towns
of
varying
population.
now,
in
view
of
certain
facts,
i'll
--
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
in
a
moment,
we
insist
that
there
is
the
same
necessity
for
deviating
from
his
inflexible
2500
population
test
as
there
was
by
his
own
recognition
for
deviating
from
any
absolute
mileage
limitation
with
respect
to
all
commodities.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no,
they
all
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
2500
applies
to
all
of
them.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
i
--
i
can
suggest
various
alternatives
to
how
he
might
define
this
term.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
there
must
some
alleviation
for
a
hard
situation
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
as
is
this
one.
now,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
a
map
of
ours
on
page
76
of
our
brief
which
is
not
our
map
but
a
map
we
produced
from
a
department
of
agriculture
publication
which
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
not
--
not
the
record.
it's
our
brief.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
we
reprinted
a
map
from
a
department
of
agriculture
publication
which
we
think
shows
pretty
plainly
how
the
town
of
quincy
is
in
the
very
heart
of
the
growing
of
type
62
tobacco.
it's
a
small
agricultural
community
is
this
town
of
quincy,
60%
of
all
of
the
--
of
this
type
of
tobacco
which
is
grown
within
30
miles
of
quincy
is
packed
in
plants
in
quincy,
largely
by
the
same
employees
who
grow
it,
in
this
small
compact
area
around
quincy
is
the
only
locality
in
the
united
states
for
this
tobacco
has
grown.
the
principal
source
of
cash
income
in
quincy
is
the
raising
of
type
62
tobacco
and
50%
of
the
wage
earners
in
the
area
actually
reside
on
farms.
we
think
that
these
facts
and
this
department
of
agriculture
map
show
plainly
that
quincy
is
in
the
very
heart
of
the
area
of
production
of
type
62
tobacco
and
that
the
administrator
should
have
allowed
some
deviation
from
his
inflexible
2500
population
test
just
as
he
allowed
it
in
other
respects
with
respect
to
different
mileages
in
different
sizes
of
towns.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
it
applies
to
all
agricultural
commodities.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
yes,
and
that
--
precisely,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
say
that
it
should
--
the
regulation
here
should
provide
a
--
a
deviation
from
2500
and
our
facts
establish
that
beyond
per
venture.
the
administrator
himself
recognized
that
a
population
test
was
not
necessary
at
one
time.
in
the
original
regulations,
he
had
no
population
test
and
from
1941
to
1947,
he
had
no
population
test.
in
a
short
time
between
1939
and
1940
he
had
it
then
he
dropped
it
because
it
resulted
in
inequalities
and
discriminations
and
he
reinserted
it
only
after
this
court's
decision
in
holly
hill.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
that's
right
--
that's
right.
now,
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
i'd
like
to
say
that
that
particular
limitation
is
an
unauthorized
limitation.
he
isn't
authorized
to
put
it
in
just
that
way
across
the
board
without
allowing
this
flexibility
in
circumstances
such
as
we
have
here
where
it's
perfectly
clear.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
you
can
petition
for
an
amendment
under
their
regulations,
your
honor,
but
they
had
never
considered
individual
applications.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no
--
no.
it
wasn't
done
here.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
they
had
never
considered
that
particular
kind
of
an
application
over
there.
they
do
this
on
an
industry
wide
basis.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
oh,
i
think
he
has
power
to
do
it.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
it
would
be
fruitless
in
this
case.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
it
would
be
fruitless
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
by
their
own
statements,
they
don't
regard
this
operation
as
falling
within
13
(a)
(10)
for
other
reasons.
their
very
--
their
hearing
officer
who
held
the
last
hearings
on
the
area
of
production
regulations
said
that
an
example
of
a
misunderstanding
is
the
proposal
of
the
one
group
of
cigar
tobacco
processors
who
appeared
at
the
hearing
and
they're
talking
about
our
group.
it
was
stated
on
their
behalf
that
in
the
bulking
operation
overtime
does
not
constitute
a
problem.
their
appearance
was
directly
toward
the
minimum
wage
exemption
under
13
(a)
(10).
the
courts
have
reviewed
and
approved
the
administrator's
position
that
the
bulking
of
cigar
leaf
tobacco
was
not
among
the
operations
enumerated
in
13
(a)
(10).
under
these
circumstances,
regardless
of
the
definition
of
area
of
production,
the
administrator
is
without
authority
to
consider
employees
engaged
in
bulking
exempt,
as
to
that
we
say
they're
wrong
of
course.
that's
one
of
our
arguments
here,
but
it
would
be
totally
fruitless
to
make
any
such
application
to
him
because
that's
his
position.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
then
we're
out.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
you
mean
that
we'd
--
aren't
bulking?
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
mean
that
bulking
is
not
under
13
(a)
to
where
--
we're
out
of
court
then.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
but
--
but,
your
honor,
if
we're
not
doing
something
which
is
in
13
(a)
(10),
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
as
to
whether
we're
within
the
area
of
production
or
not.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
have
my
very
grave
doubts
that
we
could
ever
get
any
such
relief
at
the
department
of
labor.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
that's
precisely
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
no.
i
think
he
has
the
power,
certainly.
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
--
be
arguing
this
otherwise.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
agree
with
what
you
say,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
i
--
i
don't
think
he
would
exercise
this
authority.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
he
can
but
he
wouldn't.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
our
--
our
--
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
oh,
yes.
i
think
it
probably
will.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
if
it
were
exercised,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
well,
i
--
[laughs]
i
would
like
to
turn
over
the
balance
to
mr.
hughes.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
chief
justice
warren,
in
view
of
the
fact,
the
respondents
--
i
mean
the
government
does
not
filing
its
reply
brief
when
according
to
the
rules
they
should
have.
i
wonder
if
we
might
have
some
time
to
respond
to
whatever
they
might
say
within
that
very
short
time.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
we
have
the
two
days
after
she
files
hers.
mr.
milton
c.
denbo
thank
you.
