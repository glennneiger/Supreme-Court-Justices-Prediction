may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
this
case
which
is
really
two
cases
consolidated
was
instituted
by
the
secretary
of
labor
to
enjoin
the
three
respondents
from
violating
the
minimum
wage
and
record-keeping
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
suits
were
brought
against
just
two
of
these
respondents,
king
edward
and
budd
companies
and
the
may
company
intervened
on
the
ground
that
the
same
issues
in
fact
and
law
are
similar
issues
of
fact
and
law
were
involved.
our
three
plaintiffs
operate
tobacco-bulking
plant
in
quincy,
florida.
the
cases
present
several
issues
relating
to
the
very
complex
exemptions
in
a
fair
labor
standards
act
for
employees
engaged
in
farming
and
practices
incidental
to
farming
and
to
certain
agricultural
operations
and
one
of
the
sections,
which
is
not
raised
here,
a
third
one
relates
to
certain
processing
operations.
the
three
--
the
three
sections
with
which
the
cases
is
primarily
concerned
are
printed
in
the
separate
appendix
of
the
government
and
starting
on
page
one.
and
i
think
i
should
briefly
point
out
the
differences
in
those
sections
at
the
background
to
the
facts
here.
the
agriculture
exemption
with
which
this
court
has
some
familiarity,
it
was
concerned
with
that
in
the
waialua
case
last
term,
is
a
complete
wage
hour
and
child
labor,
minimum
wage,
overtime
and
child
labor
exemption
for
farming
and
this
court
described
their
practices
which
are
really
incident
to
farming.
the
section
13
(a)
(10)
exemption
is
also
related
to
operations
that
are
--
but
which
are
performed
on
agricultural
or
horticultural
commodities
and
it
is
also
from
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
provisions
not
the
child
labor
however.
but
it
is
restricted
to
the
operations
--
operations
carried
on
within
the
area
of
production
as
the
defined
by
the
administrator.
this
court
has
recognized
that
section
13
(a)
(6)
is
related
to
the
agriculture
exemptions
as
the
two
were
designed
to
meet
to
equalize
the
situation
between
the
agriculture
exemption,
their
farming
activity
and
operations
which
--
which
might
be
close
to
the
farming.
now,
it
does
--
section
13
(a)
(10)
does
include
some
processing
operations
but
not
the
word
processing
which
we
think
is
significant.
it
doesn't
include
processing
generally,
but
it
does
specify
certain
things
which
are
processing
operations.
section
(c)
which
is
the
other
exemption
in
7
(c)
which
is
the
other
exemption
in
the
act
which
has
something
to
do
with
operations
on
agriculture
on
agriculture
commodity,
section
(c)
--
7
(c)
is
just
from
the
overtime
provisions
of
the
act.
that
is
not
the
minimum
wage.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
that
section
is
on
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
7
(c)
is
on
page
--
starts
on
page
1
of
their
separate
appendix.
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
is
an
exemption.
these
are
all
three
exemptions
which
has
some
relation
to
agriculture
or
agricultural
operations.
but
7
(c)
is
--
is
quite
different
from
the
agriculture
exemptions
which
is
3
(f),
the
definition,
quite
different
from
that
in
section
13
(a)
(10).
section
7
(c)
has
--
is
just
from
the
overtime
as
i
state
and
it
is
full
of
the
word
“processing.”
we
think
that's
quite
significant
and
i'll
come
back
to
it.
the
other
two
sections
have
nowhere
used
the
word
“processing.”
section
7
(c)
is
just
full
of
the
word.
and
section
7
(c)
so
far
as
agricultural
and
horticultural
of
commodities
are
concerned
also
limits
the
exemption
to
the
area
of
production
as
defined
by
the
administrator.
now,
the
two
other
exemptions,
the
ones
that
were
commented
on
by
this
court
in
the
waialua
case,
their
purpose
is
to
exempt
things
that
are
essentially
farming
or
practices
incident
to
farming.
i
think
the
legislative
history
makes
that
clear
that
that
was
the
purpose
and
although
section
13
(a)
(10)
did
cover
some
other
operations
and
some
processing
operations.
the
apparent
reason
for
it
was
because
there
were
some
representation
that
sometimes
those
things
were
performed
that
--
frequently
that
they
were
characteristic
of
farming
activities
enclosed
to
them.
in
section
7
(c),
on
the
other
hand,
which
is
just
the
overtime
exemption,
is
not
particularly
concerned
with
farming.it
is
frankly
and
candidly
a
processing
exemption.
it
is
not
particularly
concerned
with
farming
and
its
purpose
was
not
to
--
was
not
particularly
for
farming.
its
purpose
was
to
relieve
processes,
the
processes
there
mentioned,
of
the
overtime
provision
during
peak
seasons
of
their
operations.
it
was
not
peculiarly
concerned
with
--
with
farming.
now,
the
reason
we
think
that
is
important,
the
significant
of
that,
is
that
if
the
exemption
is
construed,
as
the
court
below
construed
it
and
respondents
urged
here
that
it'd
be
construed,
the
agriculture
exemption
in
13
(a)
(10),
then
7
(c)
is
meaningless
because
the
other
two
exemptions,
they
have
a
complete
exemptions
from
overtime
and
minimum
wages,
and
section
7
(c)
which
covers
processing
operations
gives
only
an
overtime
exemption.
and
if
those
processing
operations
are
included
under
either
one
of
the
others,
there
would
be
no
rhyme
or
reason
for
section
7
(c).
now,
to
get
back
to
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
all
three
of
the
respondents
here
operate
tobacco-bulking
plant
in
quincy,
florida.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
any
individual
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
--
of
all
the
--
the
exemptions
read
any
employee
or
any
individual
and
then
engaged
in
certain
--
engaged
in
certain
operation,
but
it
is
the
exemption
of
the
employee
who
is
engaged
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
section
7
(c)
indicates
of
any
employer.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
its
just
--
that's
just
from
the
overtime
and
its
very
carefully
restricted
and
i
might
point
put
that
the
area
of
production
definition
is
in
7
(c)
(2)
for
--
for
horticultural
and
agricultural
commodity.
some
of
the
other
things
are
exempted
without
reference
to
area
of
production,
but
the
horticultural
and
agricultural
commodity
is
all
subject
even
in
7
(c)
to
the
area
of
production
definition.
the
three
respondents
here
are
all
operating
so
far
as
physical
characteristics
of
their
plant
and
their
process
is
concerned.
their
plant,
their
tobacco-bulking
plants
are
all
pretty
much
alive.
those
plants
process,
what
is
known
as
type
62
sumatra
tobacco,
which
is
used
exclusively
for
cigar
wrappers.
that
type
of
tobacco,
like
all
of
types
of
tobacco,
requires
some
pretty
extensive
curing.
this
type
requires
to
somewhat
different
kind
of
curing
and
fermentation,
but
our
tobacco
require
some
--
some
kind
of
very
long
term
curing
when
it
comes
from
the
farm.
this
type
of
tobacco
is
--
has
to
be
a
special
agent
called
(inaudible)
pick
and
it
is
put
it
in
the
barn
as
it's
picked
and
goes
through
a
preliminary
barn
curing
process
which
is,
as
--
as
we
read
the
evidence
on
it
and
the
expert
description
of
it,
it's
primarily
a
drying
operation
wherein
the
moisture
content
is
reduced
between
85%
and
80%
down
to
25%
to
10%.
when
it
reaches
a
--
the
stage
where
it
is
ready
for
the
bulking
plant,
the
farmer
takes
it
to
the
bulking
plant
and
this
tobacco
is
located,
i
think,
from
13
to
30
miles
from
the
various
bulking
plants.
it
all
comes
within
a
30-mile
distance
from
the
plant.
it's
taken
by
the
farmers
to
the
bulking
plants
which
is
located
in
the
town
of
quincy
in
this
case.
the
bulking
plant
is
a
large
scale
industrial
plant.
it's
not
a
simple
adjunct
like
a
farm
or
like
barns
or
like
silos
or
packing
ship.
the
respondent's
description
which
seems
to
imply
the
contrary
is
plainly
refuted
by
their
own
testimony.
respondent,
budd,
asked
for
an
admission
of
fact
and
we
are
somewhat
surprise
that
their
assertion
that
this
--
that
the
plants
do
not
require
tremendous
amount
of
industrial
machinery
because
they
specifically
asked
for
an
admission
--
requested
an
admission,
and
i'm
quoting,
“that
tremendously
large
amount
that
these
plants
require
a
tremendously
large
amount
of
valuable
and
expensive
equipment.”
and
that's
on
--
on
--
in
their
request
for
admissions.
now,
the
government
objected
to
admitting
that
because
we
said
we
didn't
know
what
the
facts
were
in
that
respect
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
the
court
overruled
the
government's
objection
and
that
was
left
and
then
--
then
the
government
admitted
it.
so
that
is
undisputed
that
these
--
these
plants
require
a
tremendously
and
i'm
quoting,
“a
tremendously
large
amount
of
valuable
and
expensive
equipment.”
now,
it
suggested
that
that
would
not
apply
to
the
other
two
respondents.
the
trial
court
found
otherwise.
the
trial
court
found
that
these
plants
judging
from
the
description
of
the
process
and
from
the
similarity
of
it
that
there
was
a
sufficient
evidence
to
--
to
infer
that
the
same
kind
of
equipment
was
required
in
all
three
of
the
plants
and
i
think
from
reading
the
--
virtually
identical
affidavits
of
the
various
respondents
as
to
the
nature
of
the
process,
it
will
become
evident
that
--
that
that
is
true
of
all
three
plants
and
we
have
put
in
our
supplemental
appendix
a
quotation
from
the
department
of
agriculture
bulletin
which
specifically
states
that
this
type
of
--
of
operation
does
require
large
scale
equipment
and
that
is
why
it's
usually
done
as
an
independent
large
scale
business
by
the
bulking
plants.
now,
the
bulking
process
itself
requires
the
placing
of
the
leaves
in
bulks
of
some
3000
to
4000
pounds.
this
much
is
needed
in
order
to
retain
and
generate
sufficient
heat
for
the
sweating
and
fermentation
process.
it's
obvious
therefore
that
the
ordinary
small
farmer
is
not
in
a
position
to
do
that
bulking
on
his
own
tobacco.
it
requires,
according
to
the
admitted
evidence
or
about
100
--
not
less
than
100
acres
or
not
much
less
than
100
acres
a
year,
to
acquire
that
much
tobacco
to
put
in
the
bulking
process.
the
bulks
must
be
--
the
temperature
of
the
bulks
must
be
closely
controlled
and
watched
at
all
times.
the
whole
process
is
quite
an
extended
one
requiring
from
six
to
12
months
or
more.
it's
the
bulking
process.
it
requires
the
breaking
down
and
rebuilding
of
the
bulks
at
regular
intervals
every
six
or
eight
days.
the
piles
--
the
bulks
are
turned
completely
inside
out,
although
in
a
sense,
and
i
might
mentioned
here
too
that
the
budd
request
for
admission
also
asked
for
an
admission,
that
above
all
this
process
requires
a
skill
--
special
skill
and
experience
that
i
mentioned
that
point
in
connection
with
the
contention
that
this
is
ordinary
farm
labor
which
i
will
come
back
to
later,
although
in
a
sense,
this
is
--
there
--
the
bulking
process
is
somewhat
a
continuation
of
the
barn
curing
process
because
it's
believe
that
some
of
the
fermentation
starts
in
this
preliminary
barn
curing.
the
process
is
very
obviously
quite
a
different
one.
it
requires
quite
a
different
sort
of
control
machinery
and
skill.
i
might
also
point
that
entirely
different
wage
scales
are
maintained
for
the
bulking
plant
employees
from
what
is
maintained
for
the
farm
labor.
the
fact
that
the
farmer
does
not
ordinarily
do
this
for
himself
is
--
is
undisputed.
there
some
300
growers
of
this
type
of
tobacco
in
the
--
in
the
neighborhood
of
quincy
and
only
five
or
1.6
operate
--
1.6%
operate
bulking
plants
which
bulk
only
their
own
tobacco.
the
three
respondents,
as
i
say,
all
their
plants
are
all
engaged
in
pretty
much
the
same
operation.
they
differ
in
this
respect
that
budd
purchases
all
of
the
tobacco
it
bulks.
it
grows
no
tobacco
itself.
the
respondent
king
edward
and
may
in
the
plants
involved
in
this
litigation,
bulk
only
tobacco
grown
--
their
own
grown
tobacco.
king
edward,
although
in
the
plants
that's
in
this
litigation,
bulks
only
its
own
grown
tobacco
in
that
plant.
also
operates
two
other
plants
in
which
it
bulks
tobacco
or
purchased
from
other
farmers.
and
the
amount
of
tobacco
it
purchases
from
--
from
other
farmers
that
it
bulks
is
substantially
greater
than
the
amount
of
its
own
that
it
bulks.
so
there's
no
question
that
king
edward
is
also
engaged
in
a
large-scale
tobacco
bulking
business
which
we
--
we
think
the
fact
show
is
separate
and
apart
from
its
farming
operations.
the
--
all
three
respondents
in
the
court
below
claimed
that
they
were
exempt
on
the
both,
the
agriculture
exemption
and
the
13
(a)
(10)
exemption.
the
respondent,
budd,
has
abandoned
that
petition
in
this
court
and
admits
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
the
agriculture
exemption.
the
trial
court
held
that
none
of
the
respondents
were
entitled
to
either
one
of
these
exemptions
because
they
were
not
engaged
in
agriculture
as
define
in
the
statute
and
they
were
not
engaged
in
any
of
the
--
any
agricultural
operation
covered
by
section
13
(a)
(10).
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
ruled
that
king
edward
and
--
respondents,
king
edward
and
budd,
were
--
were
engaged
in
agriculture
and
because
--
merely
because
they
process
only
their
own
grown
crop
and
--
that
all
three
of
the
respondents
might
be
entitled
to
the
exemption
under
13
(a)
(10)
if
the
administrator
would
issue
a
valid
definition
but
held
that
the
administrative
definition
was
invalid.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
decision
was
before
the
waialua
case.
so
that
it's
conceded
that
if
the
administrator's
definition
of
area
of
production
if
this
is
regulation
defining
area
of
production
is
valid.
concededly,
budd
is
not
entitled
to
the
exemption.
none
of
them
are
entitled
to
the
13
(a)
(10)
exemption.
that
will
then
leave
the
question
as
to
whether
the
exact
same
kind
of
processing
plant
of
king
edward
and
--
and
respondent,
may,
whether
their
exact
--
precisely
the
same
processing
plant
can
be
said
to
be
exempt
as
a
mere
incident
to
farming
activity.
i
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
conceded
that
if
the
area
of
production
definition
by
the
administrator
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
is
valid,
if
it's
valid.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
they're
under
13
(a)
(6)
at
all,
they
--
they
are
subject
to
irrespective
of
--
and
even
assuming
they
are
under
13
(a)
(6),
that
any
of
them
come
within
those
operation.
assuming
they
are,
they
still
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
exemption
if
the
administrator's
definition
of
area
of
production
is
valid
because
none
of
the
three
meet
the
area
of
production
requirement
of
the
administrative
definition.
they're
all
located
in
the
town
of
quincy
which
has
a
population
of
6500
or
more.
and
under
the
--
one
of
the
criteria
and
i
--
when
it
come
to
this,
i
don't
think
i'll
have
much
time
to
discuss
it
today,
under
the
--
one
of
the
criteria
of
the
administrative
definition
is
that
the
plant
to
be
exempt
must
be
located
in
a
rural
area
which
for
purposes
of
the
definition
is
defined
as
if
a
town
of
not
more
than
2500
population.
so
that
if
that
is
valid,
then
definitely
the
respondent
budd
is
not
entitled
to
any
exemption
even
assuming
its
operation
is
one
of
those
mentioned
in
13
(a)
(10).
now,
the
other
two
respondents
would
not
be
entitled
to
that
exemption,
but
then
the
question
is
whether
they
--
they
can
exempt
under
the
definition
of
agriculture
on
the
theory
that
this
bulking
plant
operation
is
really
an
incident
to
farming.
i
barely
have
time
to
just
call
attention
to
the
--
well,
my
help
is
to
summarize
the
government's
contention.
the
government's
contention
is
that
none
--
none
of
these
respondents
are
entitled
to
either
exemption
that
they
are
--
they
are
not
engaged
that
this
bulking
operation
is
not
an
incident
to
farming,
that
it
is
not
one
of
the
operations
enumerated
in
section
13
(a)
(10)
and
that
even
if
it
is
one
of
those
operations,
none
--
none
of
the
respondents
meet
the
area
of
production
requirement.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
--
i
think
we
would
say
it
is
a
--
a
fortiori
recognizing
that
the
court
did
--
did
replace
some
qualifications
on
that
dictation,
but
we
think
considering
the
whole
analysis
of
the
decision,
this
is
a
fortiori
case.
the
only
difference,
i
would
say
that
could
be
found
in
the
two
cases,
is
it
that
there
was
an
express
mention
of
sugar
milling
in
section
7
(c)
which
the
court
suggested
might
make
that
sui
generis.
but
i
think
the
--
the
general
opinion
in
the
waialua
case
would
certainly
a
fortiori
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
hereto
this
is
not
a
mere
incident
to
farming
and
that
certainly,
it
--
it's
analogous
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
held
that
the
mere
fact,
the
mere
fact
that
the
grower
is
processing
only
his
own
crop
is
not
enough
to
make
it
agricultural.
ms.
bessie
margolin
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
adjourned
yesterday
afternoon,
i
was
making
the
point
that
the
waialua
decision
certainly
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
processor
is
processing
only
his
own
crop
that
that
mere
fact
was
not
sufficient
to
make
it
a
--
an
operation
or
a
practice
that
is
really
incident
to
farming,
that
the
waialua
decision
said
that
there
were
many
other
factors
which
were
at
least
as
pertinent
and
even
more
pertinent
to
the
question
of
whether
the
operation
is
really
an
incident
to
farming.
in
connection
in
the
--
in
the
waialua
case,
the
names
and
quite
a
few
of
those
factors
and
summarize
the
factors
which
the
--
which
the
administrator
has
repeatedly
called
attention
to.
along
those
factors
of
course
is
the
one
as
to
whether
farmers
ordinarily
carry
on
its
operation.
other
factors
where
the
size
of
the
farming
is
compared
with
the
size
that
they
--
of
the
industrial
operation,
the
extent
of
industrialization.
there
are
two
factors
that
--
that
the
respondent
here
rely
upon
which
i
think
are
important
to
bring
out
in
the
factual
background
because
respondents
represent
these
--
these
factors
in
a
way
quite
differently
from
what
we
think
the
record
shows.
and
i
might
say
in
explanation
of
the
apparent
difference
in
the
statements
the
--
of
the
respondents
and
the
statement
of
the
facts
in
the
government's
brief.
these
cases
were
really
three
cases
or
two
cases
but
with
three
respondents.
they
were
tried
on
or
decided
on
motions
and
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
and
most
of
the
evidence
was
in
the
form
of
affidavits.
so,
there
has
been
some
confusion
as
to
whether
a
particular
affidavit
relates
to
all
three
respondents
or
whether
it
relates
to
just
the
one
respondent
who
put
it
in.
but
i
think
that
confusion
was
clarified
by
the
trial
court's
finding
that
it
was
obvious
from
the
record
as
a
whole
that
all
of
these
plants,
all
of
--
three
of
them
are
pretty
much
alike
in
physical
operation
and
in
the
process.
the
only
difference
being
that
two
of
them
process
only
tobacco
grown
by
themselves
whereas
the
budd
plant
admittedly
purchases
all
the
tobacco
that
it
processes.
so
that
the
differences
in
our
statement
and
the
respondents'
statement,
i
think,
and
they
explained
on
that
basis,
respondents'
attempt
to
say
that
certain
facts
that
are
in
there
as
to
king
edward
like
the
equipment
fact
that
there's
no
evidence
on
the
record
at
all
that
king
edward
requires
any
equipment.
then
few
pages
later,
it
says
budd's
plant
is
the
same
as
king
edward's
and
so
--
so
budd
must
not
have
had
any
equipment,
when
the
fact
is,
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
that
respondent
budd
itself
put
in
the
evidence,
specifically
put
in
the
evidence
that
a
tremendous
amount
of
valuable
equipment
was
required
to
operate
one
of
its
plant.
now,
there
are
two
other
factors
in
the
factual
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that
is
one
--
certainly
one
of
the
factors
as
to
whether
how
industrialized
is
the
plant.
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
factors.
we
don't
say
that's
decisive
but
that's
one
of
the
factors
to
take
into
account.
certainly
on
the
farming
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
they
--
it's
--
it's
largely
humidifying
and
spraying
and
--
and
machinery,
drying
and
heating
and
controlling
and
thermometers,
large
thermometers.
this
--
i
have
described
the
process
yesterday
and
it
is
fully
described
in
the
briefs
and
my
time
is
so
limited
but
there
is
--
it
is
clear
that
the
--
the
process,
the
fermentation
process
is
a
long
one
and
requires
continuos
control
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
and
machinery
of
the
bulk
and
--
and
the
machinery
are
quite
extensive.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
--
they
have
to
spray
it
with
water
and
quite
--
there's
as
much
addition
of
water,
if
not
more
addition
of
water
than
there
is
lost
in
the
whole
process.
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
don't
understand.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
--
the
--
the
tobacco
is
up
to
--
keep
the
heat
and
keep
the
--
above
generating
the
--
as
a
heat.
i
don't
pretend
to
know
too
much
about
this,
you
have
to
have
a
huge
bulk
and
it
kind
of
--
it
retains
the
heat
and
the
fermentation
occurs
in
that
process.
but
it
isn't
a
simple
volunteering
process
that
respondents
attempt
to
represent
it
to
be.
it's
quite
different
and
requires
as
i
say
all
this
expensive,
a
tremendous
industrial
equipment
and
plant,
it's
a
steam-heated
plant
and
it
has
these
sprays
and
the
thermometers,
these
large
thermometers.
and
there's
no
question
if
you
read
the
description
of
the
equipment
in
budd's
--
in
budd's
request
for
an
admission
that
this
is
quite
an
industrialized
plant.
now,
coming
to
the
two
factors
which
they
also
rely
on
and
i
think
that
their
--
their
brief
also
represents
it
in
a
way
quite
different
from
the
record.
the
first
is
and
the
question
of
the
interchange
of
employee,
this
court
said
--
recognized
that
that
might
be
a
factor
as
the
administrator
has.
now,
the
respondent
makes
the
statement
that
all
of
the
employees
and
this
plant
are
ordinary
tobacco
farm
laborers.
they
just
make
that
flat
statement
in
the
brief,
page
7.
i
want
to
ask
the
court
to
please
put
a
question
mark
by
that
because
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
support
any
such
sweeping
statement.
there
is
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
rested,
by
the
way,
not
on
evidence
but
on
the
fact
that
the
government
never
denied
the
repeated
assertions
of
respondent
that
more
than
50%
of
the
workers
in
the
plant
--
that
more
than
50%
of
them
also
work
part
of
the
time
on
farms.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
no
basis
for
the
sweeping
statement
that
this
were
--
that
all
these
employees
are
farm
laborers.
and
on
the
contrary,
we
think
that
the
court's
finding
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
did
not
include
all
the
worker,
that
the
court's
finding
is
just
as
consistent
with
the
conclusion
that
these
were
essentially
industrial
workers
who
sometimes
also
worked
on
farms.
and
this
was
apparently
the
view
of
the
trial
court
because
they
found
that
they
were
not
engaged
in
farming.
so,
there's
no
evidence
that
all
in
the
record
is
to
the
relative
amount
of
time
the
employees
spend
in
the
bulking
plants
and
working
on
farms.
and
in
the
absence
of
that
evidence,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
assumed
that
they
were
more
farm
work
laborers
than
they
were
bulking
plant
laborers.
and
i
might
remind
the
court
that
this
is
the
question
of
exemption
which
the
court
has
recognized
that
the
burden
of
proof
to
prove
that
the
conditions
have
been
met
as
upon
the
employer
claimed.
now,
the
other
factor
and
as
i
pointed
out
that's
just
one
factor,
the
interchange
of
employees
we
say
is
a
factor.
we
think
it's
outweighed
by
all
the
other
factors.
the
other
factor
is
important
because
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
rested
its
decision
to
a
considerable
extent
on
it.
and
that
relates
to
the
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
bulking
process
is
essential
to
the
marketing
of
this
type
of
tobacco.
the
opinion
doesn't
state
just
what
it
means
just
whose
market
its
talking
about,
but
we
say
there
is
no
basis
in
the
record
for
respondents'
repeated
assertion
that
it
had
--
the
assertion
on
pages
15
and
16
and
i
ask
the
court
put
a
question
mark
by
those
assertion,
that
this
means
that
there
is
no
market
at
an
earlier
stage
for
type
62's
backup,
that
it
cannot
be
marketed
until
after
it
is
bulked.
those
are
the
statements
in
respondents'
brief.
if
they're
referring
to
the
farmers
market
and
the
--
apparently,
the
implication
there
is
that
this
is
the
farmers
market.
if
they're
referring
to
the
farmers
market,
this
is
refuted
specifically
by
the
regular
practice
for
both
respondent
budd
and
king
edward
to
purchase
this
tobacco
before
it's
bulked.
they
purchased
it
before
it's
bulked.
now,
what
king
edward
does
on
the
other
two
plants
is
not
involved
in
this
suit.
budd
admittedly
purchases
all
of
the
tobacco
involved
and
king
edward
purchases
about
two-thirds.
the
--
the
1951
figure
shows
that
the
total
amount
bulk
in
all
three
of
its
plants
was
--
two-thirds
of
it
was
purchased
from
other
grower.
now,
in
these
instances,
the
farmers
certainly
have
a
market
for
their
tobacco
before
it's
bulked,
before
it's
processed.
the
farmer
is
finished
with
the
tobacco
when
he
takes
it
to
the
--
when
he
leaves
it
at
the
bulking
plant
and
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
bulking
process
unless
he
happens
to
be
hired
as
one
of
the
employees
in
the
plant
in
which
case
i
can
assure
you
he
would
want
to
get
the
minimum
wage.
but
so
far
as
his
capacity
as
a
farmer
is
concerned,
he
has
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
bulking
process.
now,
the
price
he
will
eventually
receive
for
his
product
may
be
determined
on
the
grade
after
the
bulking.
but
he
has
disposed
of
it,
definitely
and
irrevocably
before
the
bulking
process
starts.
now,
there's
also
other
evidence
in
the
record
which
shows
pretty
clearly
we
think
that
the
bulking
process
in
these
cases
is
incident
to
the
manufacture
of
cigars
rather
than
incident
to
farming.
for
example,
the
record
shows
that
the
budd
plant
is
closely
affiliated
with
the
budd
cigar
manufacturing
company
or
one
of
the
husband
members
who's
a
respondent
in
this
case
is
the
president
of
the
budd
cigar
manufacturing
company
which
is
at
the
same
address
--
the
same
address
is
the
bulking
plant,
it's
right
next
door
and
it
has
the
same
address.
and
over
two
thirds
of
the
tobacco
bulked
at
the
budd
plant
is
sold
to
the
budd
cigar
manufacturing
company.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
question
is,
is
this
an
incident
to
farming
or
is
it
an
incident
to
manufacturing?
and
we
say
that
all
the
factors
here
militate
in
favor
saying
this
is
not
an
incident,
a
true
incident
to
farming,
this
is
really
an
incident
to
manufacturing.
now,
the
same
is
true
--
a
similar
situation
with
king
edward.
the
record
shows
that
king
edward
is
closely
affiliated
with
the
john
swisher
&
son
cigar
company
which
is
a
well-known
manufacturer
of
cigars.
the
king
edward
cigar,
i
think,
is
one
that's
most
permanently
known
and
swisher
is
the
president
--
carl
s.
swisher
is
the
president
of
the
king
edward
company
and
king
edward
sells
over
50%
of
its
tobacco
to
swisher
and
company,
the
cigar
manufacturers.
we
think
that
evidence
is
very
significant
in
showing
that
this
bulking
process
is
more
--
is
done
more
than
incident
to
the
cigar
manufacturing
than
it
is
on
behalf
of
the
farmer,
that
it's
much
closer
to
the
manufacturing
than
it
is
to
the
farmer.
ms.
bessie
margolin
now
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
section
7.i'm
talking
about
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
to
--
to
clarify
this
--
when
i
referred
to
--
to
the
agricultural
exemption,
i'll
refer
to
that
as
the
farming
exemption,
13
(a)
(10)
is
the
other
one
which
is
i
referred
to
and
i
did
confuse
--
i
didn't
--
i
was
told
subsequently
that
i
confused
the
section,
mr.
justice
reed,
and
i'm
sorry.
section
13
(a)
(10),
i'll
refer
to
as
the
area
production
exemption
and
the
13
(a)
(6)
are
the
agriculture
--
the
farming
exemption.
i've
been
talking
about
the
farming
exemption
thus
far.
i'll
come
now
to
the
area
of
production
exemption.
and
i
point
out
that
budd
admits
that
it
is
not
entitled
to
the
farming
exemption,
it
must
come
under
the
area
of
production
exemption
if
it
is
entitled
to
an
--
an
exemption
at
all.
and
it
also
if
king
edward
--
respondent
king
edward
and
may
are
not
engaged
in
farming
as
we
think
--
as
we
think
we've
shown
they
are
not,
they
too
are
interested
in
finding
out
whether
they
are
under
the
area
of
production
exemption.
so,
on
the
area
of
production
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
the
most
important
issue
here
and
i'm
sorry
i've
taken
so
much
time
getting
to
it.
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
is
the
most
comprehensive
and
this
is
the
thing
that
--
this
is
the
question
that's
most
important
generally
in
the
administration
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
would
not
necessarily
take
care
of
both
cases
unless
you
agree
with
us
that
king
edward
and
may
are
not
engaged
in
farming.
if
you
agree
with
us
on
that,
this
takes
care
of
the
--
of
all
three
cases.
now,
the
area
production
definition
is
attacked
on
by
respondents
and
by
the
amici
on
various
grounds
and
i
think
that
when
the
court
start
digging
into
the
grounds
and
i
hope
you
will
read
what
the
administrator
and
it
has
the
findings
he
made
in
--
when
he
first
issued
this
definition
as
well
as
those
he
made
in
1951
after
he'd
been
in
operation
for
four
years
when
--
i
think
when
you
read
that
you
will
realize
that
it
is
an
extremely
difficult
task.
we've
been
struggling
with
it
and
trying
awfully
hard
to
do
a
fair
job
in
taking
into
account
the
proper
economic
factors
which
this
court
said
we
should
in
the
holly
hill
case.
before
i
plunge
into
that,
i
just
want
to
say
that
the
effort
in
this
definition
which
was
issued
about
nine
years
ago
was
two
years
after
the
holly
hill
decision
holding
the
other
definition
invalid.
this
was
--
there
was
two
years
of
hearings
and
then
this
redefinition
was
issued
and
every
effort
was
made
and
it's
fully
explained
in
the
administrator's
findings
to
meet
the
geographic
boundary
guards
and
taking
into
account
at
the
same
time
all
of
the
complicated
economic
factors.
now
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
were
hearings
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
were
--
they
were
hearings
on
the
basis
of
which
it
was
framed,
i
think.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
--
my
recollection
is
that
he
did
not.
now,
of
course
in
the
second
hearings
in
the
--
in
1951,
there
--
he
did
have
this
outstanding
and
so
well,
he
was
--
it
was
specifically
directed
to
this
and
--
and
all
of
the
objections
that
are
being
raised
by
the
amici
and
the
respondents
here,
all
those
objections
were
placed
before
him
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
specific
recommendations
they're
making.
the
administrator
delayed
his
decision
after
the
1951
hearings
and
these
all
appears
in
those
1951
finding.
he
delayed
his
decisions
to
thoroughly
and
carefully
explore
the
feasibility
of
following
out
this
suggestion.
it
wasn't
just
cast
aside
as
the
--
well,
that
--
that's
something
that
we
don't
think
we
can
do.
he
made
--
he
--
he
investigated
the
bureau
of
the
census
data,
the
--
the
internal
revenue
data.
he
made
a
special
survey
to
see
whether
he
could
secure
any
data
on
which
he
could
base
criteria,
which
would
consider
--
which
would
enable
him
to
distinguish
between
urban
and
rural
area.
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
i
think
it's
pretty
well-known.
he
--
i'm
sure
he's
--
there's
no
question
here
that
he
hasn't
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
given
the
proper
notice.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
they
--
it's
--
it's
--
they
have
public
hearings
and
also
a
lot
of
private
conferences.
it
isn't
a
formal
adjudication
procedure.
but
they
fully
follow
the
--
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
administrative
procedures
act
and
there's
no
--
i
don't
think
anyone
has
raised
any
question
as
to
notice
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'm
not
--
that's
why
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
i
would
like
to
get
on
to
the
--
to
the
particular
parts
of
this
definition.
the
definition
as
we
say
does
plainly
follow
the
requirement
that
it
be
stated
in
geographic
bounds.
the
two
--
the
two
basic
criteria
are
--
are
one
that
the
plant
be
located
in
--
within
a
particular
mileage
distance
of
the
source
of
its
commodities
and
that
it
be
located
in
a
rural
area
which
is
prescribed
in
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
definition
to
be
a
town
of
not
more
than
2500
population.
now,
the
main
attack
--
the
main
attack
has
been
on
the
selection
of
this
2500
population,
although
the
amici
here
and
i
think
respondents
too
assert
that
the
administrative
test
is
really
one
just
of
mapping
out
the
areas
where
the
crop
is
produced.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
spend
much
time
on
that
because
in
traders
compress
case,
i
think,
clearly
pointed
out
that
this
court's
decision
in
holly
hill
couldn't
have
meant
that
all
the
administrator
was
suppose
to
do
was
to
mark
out
the
production
areas
where
the
crop
is
produced.
and
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
respondents
themselves
seriously
rely
on
that.
mr.
todd,
who
represented
the
traders
compress
--
identified
the
traders
compress
case
is
the
case
which
three
years
ago,
the
tenth
circuit
upheld
this
definition
and
this
court
denied
certiorari,
there
was
no
conflict
at
that
time.
mr.
todd,
who
represented
the
traders
compress,
represents
most
of
the
amici
here.
he
--
he
put
all
of
his
--
his
objections
and
criticisms
before
congress
in
--
in
1948
and
1949
and
congress
--
congress
declined
to
do
anything
about
it.
so,
this
is
his
third
attempt
to
--
probably
the
third
or
fourth
attempt
to
get
something
done
by
--
on
the
basis
of
the
same
data
and
the
same
proposal.
ms.
bessie
margolin
holly
hill
has
a
suggestion
which
was
made
during
the
hearings
--
during
both
hearings,
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
during
the
1951
hearing.
they
say
that
the
--
it's
--
the
population
shouldn't
be
controlling.
there
should
be
a
flexible
test
of
where
--
where
is
the
main
source
of
income
of
the
community.
is
it
essentially
from
agriculture
or
is
it
essentially
from
industries?
the
administrator
went
very,
very
thoroughly
into
the
possibilities
of
that
because
superficially
it
sounds
logical.
they
say
that
taking
of
a
--
an
inflexible
population
test
that
you
--
you're
going
to
get
some
communities
which
are
really
essentially
rural
but
they
have
a
population
over
2500.
and
they
say
that's
the
case
of
quincy.
if
i
have
time,
i'd
like
to
show
how
unreliable
their
--
their
evidence
is
on
their
assertion
that
quincy
is
just
a
little
rural
agricultural
town.
but
the
administrator
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
the
holly
hill
was
not
concerned
with
that
because
they
didn't
decide
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
there
was
at
that
time
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
holly
hill
does
say
that
and
i
might
call
your
attention
to
the
fact,
justice
reed,
that
at
the
time
of
the
holly
hill
case,
there
had
been
in
effect
a
definition
just
like
this
and
that
was
involved
in
holly
hill.
and
this
court
did
not
pass
on
the
validity
of
that
rural
area,
i
think
less
accurately
called
population
test.
we
sometimes
--
i
believe,
they
refer
to
it
as
population
test.
i
think
it's
more
accurately
called
rural
area
test.
if
that
rural
area
test
was
in
the
--
that
definition
which
this
court
said
it
was
unnecessary
to
rule
on
at
that
time
and
--
but
the
holly
hill
decision
did
say
--
did
point
out
that
--
that
the
legislative
history
showed
that
congress
intended
some
distinction
between
rural
and
--
and
urban
areas
and
i
think
you'll
find
the
legislative
history
is
full
of
that.
now,
i'll
come
to
one
point
on
that
because
--
that
respondents
rely
on
--
particularly,
because
they
say
that
the
--
the
legislative
history
on
the
difference
between
urban
and
rural
community
is
in
their
favor
and
they
refer
to
what
i
might
call
the
winchester
colloquy
between
senator
connally
and
senator
schwellenbach.
and
they
say
in
that
--
they
--
they
claim,
in
fact
the
amici
say
that
senator
schwellenbach
categorically
stated
that
packing
of
apples
in
winchester,
virginia
would
be
exempt
as
within
the
area
of
production
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
population
of
winchester
was
more
than
$10,000
--
10,000
person.
the
short
answer
to
this
is
--
and
they
rely
very
heavily
on
this,
the
amici
and
the
respondents,
the
short
answer
is
that
--
that
senator
schwellenbach
did
not
make
this
statement
either
categorically
or
otherwise.
on
the
--
and
on
the
contrary,
he
was
most
careful
to
qualify
his
--
his
--
all
of
his
statement
with
references
to
the
--
he
--
he
say
if
they
meet
the
conditions
of
the
proposal.
now,
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
colloquy,
which
is
in
our
separate
appendix
on
page
26
--
no,
62,
senator
connally
asked,
“would
not
the
effect
of
this
amendment
be
to
exempt
all
industrial
warehouses
in
packing
plants
in
the
apple
territory.
there
is
no
limit,
the
condition
is
that
they
are
packing
plants
and
if
they
are,
they
are
exempt."
senator
schwellenbach
answered,
“if
a
packing
plant
is
working
upon
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
in
their
raw
and
natural
state
within
the
immediate
production
of
the
area,
it
would
be
exempt.”
in
other
words,
it
is
exempt
if
it
meets
the
exemption,
then
when
he
comes
--
then
comes
the
question
about
the
largest
apple
packing
plant
in
the
world
in
winchester,
virginia
and
senator
connally
said,
“that
would
be
exempt,
would
it
not?”
and
i
call
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
didn't
mention
the
population
of
winchester.
and
this
was
senator
schwellenbach's
answer,
“if
the
work
is
done
in
that
plant,
if
it
is
as
described
in
the
amendment,
it
would
be
exempt."
and
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
senator
schwellenbach
carefully
qualified
his
answers,
he
just
said
if
they
meet
the
condition.
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
if
the
proposal
he
was
talking
about
at
the
time
did
not
contain
a
provision
for
the
definition
by
the
--
by
the
administrator
and
in
his
(inaudible),
immediately
thereafter,
he
had
a
colloquy
with
senator
black.
and
senator
black
asked
him
specifically,
“what
about
area?
what
would
be
the
definition
of
area,
would
it
be
possible
to
define
it
more
clearly?”
and
senator
schwellenbach
said,
“i
gave
considerable
thought
to
that.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
possible
and
that
is
something
which
the
board,
which
is
accused
of
receiving
too
much
power,
would
have
to
decide
it,
would
have
to
provide
the
definition.”
now,
to
be
noted
too
that
senator
schwellenbach
wasn't
--
was
not
from
the
state
of
virginia,
he's
from
the
state
of
washington
and
there's
no
indication
at
all
that
he
had
any
idea
what
the
population
of
winchester,
virginia
was.
and
he
certainly
never
said
anything
to
indicate
what
he
thought
was
of
the
population
of
the
--
the
proper
standard
to
be
applied.
he
said
that
would
have
to
be
left
to
the
administrator.
now,
finally,
i
might
point
out
that
senator
schwellenbach
was
secretary
of
labor
at
the
time
this
definition
was
issued
and
i
think
if
senator
schwellenbach
had
felt
that
it
went
beyond
the
authority
of
the
administrator
or
that
it
was
unreasonable
that
he
would
not
have
committed
it
to
go
into
effect
or
to
continue
in
--
in
effect.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
remaining
reason
--
minutes
for
rebuttal.
ms.
bessie
margolin
where
we
said
that
bulking
might
be
--
might
be
among
the
things
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it
--
it
has
not
been
specifically
modified
and
i
think
that's
what
--
where
some
of
the
confusion
has
come
in.
it
was
issued
way
in
1939
and
--
and
even
in
that
bulletin
if
your
honor
will
recall,
it
is
stated
that
an
operation
done
on
a
farm
or
where
the
product
is
processed,
the
process
is
just
processing
his
own
product,
even
though
it's
off
the
farm,
it
might
be
agriculture.
and
among
the
examples
giving
--
given
was
bulking.
that
has
caused
us
a
lot
of
headaches
just
like
the
original
interpretation
we
put
out
and
we
gave
an
example,
sugar
milling,
if
it
were
done
by
the
employer
just
on
his
own
crop.
after
the
bowie
case
and
--
and
the
administrator
to
that
extent
is
responsible
for
some
of
the
confusion
and
i
think
the
court
probably
realizes
by
now
that
this
is
an
extremely
complex
and
difficult
subject
area
and
it's
extremely
widespread
and
we
had
made
our
mistakes
frankly
too.
but
after
the
bowie
case
came
out,
we
did
come
out
specifically
and
say
with
respect
to
sugar
milling
that
apparently
the
administrator
went
too
far
in
saying
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
farmer
or
that
the
processor
was
just
processing
his
own
crop,
put
him
into
agriculture,
we
said
that
--
that
we
went
too
far.
well,
we've
also
said
the
same
thing
about
bulking.
now,
we
haven't
--
we
--
we
have
put
in
our
supplemental
appendix
and
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
to
go
over
this
because
i
want
to
get
to
the
point
on
the
legislative
history
of
area
of
production,
but
we
put
in
our
supplemental
appendix
the
context
of
the
decision
--
of
the
opinions
of
the
administrator
that
respondents
rely
on.
and
the
court
will
find
that
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
he
has
qualified
it
carefully
by
saying,
“if
you
meet
these
conditions."
the
conditions
which
this
court
set
forth
in
the
waialua
opinion
in
addition
to
other
conditions
which
this
court
says
are
also
pertinent.
in
every
--
in
every
one
of
these
opinion
since
the
bowie
case
in
relation
to
canning
and
vegetable
and
in
relation
to
tobacco.
the
administrator
has
been
very
careful
to
--
not
say
that
they
would
be
engaged
in
agriculture.
he's
been
very
careful
to
say
if
you
meet
these
tests
and
i
think
you'll
see
in
the
context
that
that
--
that
he
has
been
careful
to
say
that,
although
he
may
have
been
originally
responsible
for
some
of
the
confusion.
now,
to
come
back
to
the
area
of
production
thing,
i
think
that
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
regulation
of
general
application
applies
to
numerous
industries,
operations
on
over
300
--
more
than
300
commodities
and
necessarily
it
may
not
--
any
definition,
a
regulation
may
not
operate
in
every
particular
case
to
carry
out
the
full
intent
of
congress,
assuming
that
that
intent
is
as
clear
as
respondent
seem
to
think.
but
the
fact
that
it
might
operate
in
a
particular
case
under
those
circumstances
certainly
wouldn't
invalidate
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
this
court
said
in
holly
hill,
that
that
is
precisely
the
thought
of
--
of
standard
that
have
to
be
left
to
the
administrator
and
not
to
the
diversities
and
inevitable
contingencies
or
the
other
way
around,
contingencies
and
inevitable
diversity
of
particular
litigated
cases.
that
the
simple
answer
to
this
thing,
to
this
whole
question
and
there
is
a
simple
and
decisive
answer
and
the
court
does
not
need
to
concern
itself
with
all
the
headache
the
administrator
has
had
trying
to
see
what
is
the
feasible
definition.
and
by
the
way,
respondents'
proposals
have
been
very
seriously
considered
by
the
administrator
and
if
the
court
will
read
our
supplemental
appendix
setting
forth
the
findings
of
the
hearing
officer
which
were
adopted
by
the
administrator,
you
will
see
how
carefully
and
thoroughly
the
administrator
has
explored
just
as
precisely
their
suggestion
here
that
he
look
into
the
income
and
try
to
determine
and
he
considers
specifically
whether
it
would
be
feasible
to
have
an
escape
clause.
well,
it
was
obvious
that
there's
not
enough
data
or
--
or
there's
simply
not
the
data
available,
any
reliable
data
and
everyone
would
be
coming
in
to
ask
for
the
escape
clause
and
he
had
no
data
on
which
to
--
to
base
the
decision
which
would
have
an
escape
clause.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
doubt
it.
very
seriously,
this
record
is
--
is
quite
meager
as
--
as
the
court
realizes
by
this
time
because
it
was
done
on
motions
for
summary
judgement
and
cross-motion.
but
i
come
now
to
the
simple
answer.
there
is
a
simple
and
decisive
answer
to
this
area
of
production
question
and
that
is
that
congress
has
ratified
in
1949
amending
act.
the
--
this
definition
has
been
before
congress
repeatedly
--
repeatedly
and
all
of
the
same
criticisms
that
are
made
here
were
made
to
congress.
in
fact,
the
administrator
and
the
secretary
themselves,
these
excessive
administrators
and
secretary
have
told
congress
that
--
that
we're
not
satisfied
with
this
definition.
we've
knocked
ourselves
out
trying
to
get
one
that
would
not
result
in
--
in
inequity.
we
don't
think
it
can
be
done
if
we're
--
if
we're
limited
to
geographic
boundary
that
there
bound
to
be
some
inequity.
and
congress,
although
repeatedly
asked
to
these
--
through
these
other
things,
decided
not
to
do
anything.
they
have
declined
specific
proposals.
they
have
declined
specific
proposals
by
mr.
todd
and
in
1949,
when
the
proposal
was
made
to
transfer
this
authority
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
they
declined
to
do
that.
they
went
ahead
and
enacted
several
other
amendments,
many
other
amendments
because
they
reviewed
the
fair
labor
standards
act
comprehensively
and
there
was
a
proposal
to
amend
section
13
(a)
(10).
some
people
wanted
the
area
of
production
exemption
taken
out
entirely.
others
wanted
it
translated
--
function
transferred
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
but
congress
and
its
--
the
legislative
history
on
that
is
in
our
supplemental
appendix.
they
decided
that
for
a
variety
of
reasons
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
subject
and
their
interest
in
enacting
other
amendments
at
that
--
at
that
time.
they
decided
to
--
to
leave
the
law
as
it
was
and
it
--
that
was
specifically
said
so
in
the
house
manager's
report
in
reporting
why
they
had
adopted
the
senate
version.
and
it
was
--
they
just
specifically
decided
and
they
put
in
this
express
provision
when
they
enacted
the
other
amendments.
they
put
in
this
section
(c)
--
16
(c)
provision
which
expressly
kept
in
effect
any
regulation
order,
interpretation
of
the
administrator
in
effect
at
the
time
at
the
--
on
the
effective
date
as
to
the
language
on
the
effective
date
of
the
amendment
--
of
the
amending
act.
there's
no
question
that
this
definition
was
in
effect
on
the
effective
date
of
the
1949
amending
act
and
that
it
--
it
was
not
inconsistent
with
anything
in
that
act
because
that
--
it
has
been
specifically
left
unchanged,
section
13
(a)
(10)
and
the
definition.
ms.
bessie
margolin
1949
amendment.
oh,
yes,
it
was
after
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
is
1946.
so,
there's
no
question
that
it
was
in
effect
that
they
considered
it
and
they
deliberately
decided
that
they
would
leave
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
the
status
of
things
as
they
were.
everyone
wants
some
improvement
of
this
and
we
hope
someday
we'll
get
it
from
the
legislature
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
but
it
is
a
legislative
question.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
language
of
16
(c)?
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
--
the
language
of
that
act
is
section
16
(c)
and
it
is
quoted
in
our
brief.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
it
specifically
keeps
in
effect
any
regulation
order
or
interpretation
of
the
administrator
in
effect
on
the
effective
date
of
the
act
and
this
was
in
effect.
and
i
say
that
is
the
simple
answer,
although
i
don't
want
it
--
i
don't
want
to
have
it
inferred
that
we
agree
with
everything
that
respondents
--
or
much
of
anything
that
they
said
about
the
operation
of
this
standard
in
their
particular
case.
and
i
might
say
that
so
many
questions
have
developed
which
i
--
during
the
oral
argument
which
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
we
filed
a
reply
brief
and
if
the
court
would
permit
it,
i'd
be
glad
to
try
to
clarify
some
of
these
questions
that
have
come
up
during
the
oral
argument
in
the
reply
brief.
ms.
bessie
margolin
thank
you,
sir.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
about
--
with
--
like
at
least
a
week
if
i
may
because
of
the
problem
of
printing
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
there
are
just
few
matters
which
i
think
i
could
get
up
in
the
--
in
two
or
three
days.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
there
is
one
item
that
i
might
on
that.
ms.
bessie
margolin
with
this
act.
they
are
talking
about
the
1949
amending
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they're
talking
about
the
act
they
were
then
enacting
which
was
--
which
was
a
pretty
comprehensive
act
amending
quite
a
few
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
--
i
--
because
they
referred
in
other
point
to
the
--
they
referred
in
other
point
to
the
1938
act.
so,
they
--
they
must,
at
that
point,
be
referring
to
this
act,
the
1949
act.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
we
had
this
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
discussion
when
the
question
first
came
up
in
connection
with
the
(inaudible)
case
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
i
think
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
of
this
act.
that's
right.
and
so,
the
first
part
of
sentence
is
referring
to
the
--
all
the
regulation's
interpretation
under
the
1938
act
shall
remain
in
effect
except
to
the
extent
inconsistent
to
this
act.
i
don't
think
they
referred
to
this
act.
