i
don't
recall
in
holly
hill
that
it
said
the
size
of
the
town
made
any
difference.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

--
justice
stanley

say
it
and
where

the
idea
of
a
size
of
a
town
having
anything
to
do
with
the
company?
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
does
a
farmer
do
with
a
tobacco

he
cuts
them?
justice
stanley

how
many
days,
weeks
or
months
does

tobacco
hang
on

barn?
justice
stanley

and

its
first
curing
in

justice
stanley

of
the
--
of
a
curing.
justice
stanley

and
--
and
held
that
so
far
as
they
work
on
the
farm
they
were
free
as
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
and
so
far
as
they
work
in
the
plant,
processing
plant,
they
were
not,
is
that
it?
justice
stanley

well,

--

--
justice
stanley
reed
but
which
section
you're
talking
about?
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
--
do
you
happen
to
know
how
a
farmer
that
doesn't
have
a
packing
plant
--
where
he
sells
his
tobacco?
justice
stanley
reed
no,
no.
justice
stanley
reed
how
does
he
sell
it?
does
the
packing
plant
man
go
out
to
his
farm?
justice
stanley
reed
well
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
i'm
--
i'm
familiar
with
other
kinds
of
tobacco
where
they're
sent
into
a
warehouse
and
they're
sold
at
the
warehouse.
justice
stanley
reed
the
farmer
hauls
it
in
and
makes

justice
stanley

have
you
--
justice
stanley

(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
(a)
(6)?
justice
stanley
reed
or
--
or
(10)?
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
this
is
--
(f)
is
nothing
but
a
definition
of
what
is
made
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
--
the
mere
fact
that
you're
engaged
in
agriculture,
it
doesn't
take
you
out
unless
you
come
within
one
of
the
others.
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
that
probably
depend
on
what
is
preparation
for
market?
justice
stanley
reed
that
depend
on
the
phrase
"preparation
for
market?"
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that
was
true
with
waialua
too?
justice
stanley
reed
and
what
i
have
in
mind
is
that
--
as
i
understand
the
--
the
records
here
is
they
--
this
tobacco
could
have
been
marketed
completely
away
from
the
farm
without
going
through
this
process,
it's
--
it's
in
the
packing
plant.
justice
stanley
reed
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
certainly,
what
the
other
farmers,
perhaps
a
majority
of
them,
take
their
tobacco
from
their
farms
and
deliver
to
the
processing
plant
after
it
has
gone
through
the
first
of
the
curing
process?
justice
stanley
reed
so,
at
that
time,
all
tobacco
could
be
sold,
ready
for
the
market.
justice
stanley
reed
and
i
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
i
recognize
the
distinction
you
made
in
waialua
that
there
the
sugar
cane
was
priced,
but
also
other
sugar
cane
farmers
could
have
sold
their
sugar
cane
before
it
is
priced
and
take
it
to
the
processing
plant
and
just
take
it
to
the
farming
houses.
