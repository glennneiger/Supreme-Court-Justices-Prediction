if
we're
with
you
on
the
--
on
the
branch
of
the
case
that
you're
about
to
enter,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
others?
justice
felix

that
was
not
my
intention,
i
just
want
to
know
whether
this
isn't
the
most
comprehensive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
would
take
care
of
the
whole
--
of
the
cases,
both
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
by
understanding
of
a
process
--
of
the
administrative
process,
the
hearings
you
speak
of,
were
the
hearings
directed
through
a
--
through
a
proposed
regulation
or
were
they
hearings
on
the
basis
to
which
the
regulation
is
framed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
make
any
difference
with
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
there's
a
--
there
was
a
hearing
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
isn't
it,
it
was
framed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
not
addressed
themselves
to
a
proposal
which
was
before
them,
is
that
right?
justice
felix

i
don't
--
i
don't
know
because
i
don't
recall.
does
the
statute
define
the
kind
of
notice
that
could
give

give
you
before
the
promulgation
of

as
i
say
or
is
that
known
in
the
industry
as
a
freight
or
whatever
it's
called.
justice

no,
no,
no.
i
--
justice

i
just
want
to
know
what
the
process
is

justice

i'm

justice

do
that

so

as

that
(inaudible)
justice

you
said
$2500
(inaudible)
invalid
so
far
as
applied
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
there
--
well,
there's
some
special
circumstances
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
a
suggestion
that
this
is
a
dairyman's
drink
so
far
as
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mistake,
that's
what
i'm
--
that
is
--
it
is
to
that
that
my
question
is
directed
to.
the
implications
so
far
as
applied
here
means
it
might
be
applied
elsewhere,
it
would
be
all
right,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
with
an
expert,
what
the
--
what
is
the
peculiar
which
would
make
a
validly
--
roughly
the
sum
2500
population
there,
it
was
not
in
reference
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
so
far
as
applied
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
requires
that
this
--
there's
some
ad
hocness
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
isn't
sufficient
to
show
that
the
general
rule
otherwise
valid,
every
classification
is
a
little
bit
like
the
(inaudible),
it
--
it
was
the
only
situation
where
you'll
be
dealing
with
a
difficulty.
it
isn't
enough
to
show
that
in
this
case
wherein
(inaudible)
or
an
unfairness
or
a
hardship
or
call
it
what
you
will

burden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

in
this
case,
you're
not
arguing
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
(inaudible)
--
what
you
say
here,
you
reply
--
you
imply
here
that
we
have
to
imply
your
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
here
or
is
there
--
is
--
is
your
argument
that
administrative
cannot
draw
a
line
as
2500
because
they
only
go
on
less
or
more.
here
--
when
you
say
here,
i
want
to
know
why
here
rather
than
somewhere
--
in
some
other
case.
what
does
--
what
is
there
about
here
that
this
was
from
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
your
argument
if
you
--
if
you
will
tell
me
the
facts,
make
it
appear
that
there's
something
peculiar
about
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
however
it
may
be
true
that
he
may
classify
referrinf
to
a
record
of
25
--
a
population
of
2500
in
this
case,
it
would
be
something
so
arbitrary
it
is
not
to
be
within
the
rule-making
power,
is
that
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
just
want
to
know
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
--
is
there
any
escape
clause
in

in
this
regulation
--
justice

frankfurter
--
as
to
other
commodities?
are
there
other

justice

that
they
all
give
a
fix
--
they
all
(voice

--
justice
felix

all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
he
said
2500
to
exempt
something
or
rather
that
it
will
be
all
right,
is
that
it?
justice

(voice

some
alleviation
for
a
particular
hard
situation.
justice

right.

it

he
