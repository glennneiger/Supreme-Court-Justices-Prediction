mr.
mark
f.
hughes
may
it
please
your
honors.
i
appear
for
the
may
tobacco
company
and
perhaps
i
should
be
happy
at
the
fact
that
up
to
this
point
there's
been
practically
nothing
said
about
may
tobacco
company.
however,
that
may
be
i
--
in
the
short
time
alloted,
i
want
to
make
clear
the
reasons
why
on
the
record
in
the
may
case
we
fall
within
the
agricultural
exemption.
the
agricultural
exemption
is
the
exemption
appearing
in
section
3
(f),
that
is
to
say
3
(f)
defines
agriculture
and
may
i
interpose
by
saying
it
doesn't
define
farming,
it
defines
agriculture
which
is
a
much
broader
term
and
if
an
employee
is
employed
in
agriculture
then
under
the
section
13
(a)
(6),
he
is
exempt
from
the
wage
and
hour
provisions
of
the
law.
now,
we
filed
a
separate
brief
and
our
brief
is
the
white
covered
smaller
brief
and
appearing
at
page
7
of
that
brief
is
the
relevant
statutory
provision
which
i
shall
come
to
in
just
a
moment.
but
i
wish
first
to
emphasize
that
there
were
two
records
as
must
be
apparent
to
your
honors
from
the
fact
that
you're
dealing
with
two
separate
transcripts
of
record.
these
cases
were
consolidated
by
the
district
judge
solely
as
a
matter
of
his
convenience
but
the
records
are
different
and
in
his
opinion
he
says
so
in
so
many
words.
he
says
that
the
facts
as
to
the
king
edward
case
and
as
to
the
may
case,
which
is
my
case,
are
quite
different
from
those
in
the
budd
case.
now,
i
stress
the
fact
that
we
are
intervenors
only
in
the
king
edward
case
and
that
the
record
before
your
honors
on
this
motion
for
summary
judgement
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
are
the
moving
and
opposing
affidavits
on
our
particular
motion.
now,
coming
to
the
factual
situation,
let
me
say
this
that
if
we
--
if
we
establish
the
fact
under
section
3
(f)
that
we
are
within
the
exemption
then
it
is
unimportant,
in
fact,
you
don't
even
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
the
exemption
provided
by
section
13
(a)
(10)
applies
to
us.
and
so
in
our
brief,
we
have
briefed
only
that
one
point
and
we
have
relied
entirely
upon
the
brief
of
budd
and
king
edward
for
the
proposition
that
we
are
also
covered
by
the
section
13
(a)
(10)
exemption
and
we
simply
adopt
their
argument.
now,
quickly
on
the
facts
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
(a)
(10)?
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
13
(a)
(6)?
well,
we-
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
well,
no.
well,
we
say
we
do
come
under
section
13
(a)
(6),
your
honor.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
that
--
that
is
correct
and
we
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
no,
sir.
in
our
--
our
principal
point
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
--
our
principal
point
is
this,
that
may's
employees
who
worked
in
its
packing
plant
are
engaged
in
agriculture
as
agriculture
is
defined
in
section
3
(f)
of
the
act
and
because
they
are
engaged
in
agriculture,
they
are
exempt
under
section
13
(a)
(6)
of
the
act
because
section
13
(a)
(6)
of
the
act
says
in
so
many
words
that
an
employee
employed
in
agriculture
is
exempt
from
the
wage
and
hour
provisions
of
the
act.
so,
it
is
to
that
proposition
that
--
and
that
alone
that
our
brief
is
directed
and
i
want
briefly
to
give
you
our
factual
situation
because
it's
important.
may
owns
its
own
farms
in
gadsden
county.
may
owns
only
one
packing
plant
and
i
use
the
word
“packing
plant”
advisedly
because
that's
what
it
is
and
that's
what
it
has
always
been
known
as
and
that's
how
it's
referred
to
in
the
record.
at
--
may
only
does
the
bulking
of
its
own
tobacco
in
its
own
tobacco
plant.
may
does
not
do
any
bulking
and
by
that
i
mean
the
process
which
mr.
denbo
has
described,
the
piling
and
re-piling.
it
does
not
perform
any
of
those
functions
on
anybody
else's
tobacco,
only
its
own
tobacco.
now,
i
repeat
also
that
the
--
what
occurs
here
and
it's
been
loosely
referred
to
as
processing
is
nothing
but
a
curing
operation,
the
tobacco
is
picked,
it's
first
put
in
the
curing
barns,
the
tobacco
barn
as
we
know
it
where
it
remains
for
a
while
and
then
is
transferred
immediately
to
the
packing
plant.
and
this
packing
plant,
what
is
it?
it's
been
referred
to
as
a
highly
industrialized
operation.
well,
what
it
amounts
to
is,
it
--
it
is
a
heated
enclosure
and
in
that
heated
enclosure,
all
that
happens
is
that
these
people
who
perform
the
--
the
functions
on
the
farm
of
tilling
the
soil
and
picking
the
tobacco
also
perform
this
function
and
all
that
they
do
is
to
put
this
into
piles
of
3500
to
4000
pounds
of
tobacco
and
after
those
piles
have
settled
for
a
while,
they
pull
them
apart
again
and
re-pile
them
so
that
what
was
inside
comes
to
the
outside
and
so
that
there
is
an
even
distribution
of
temperature
and
an
even
curing
of
the
tobacco.
but
the
big
point,
your
honors,
is
that
from
the
time
it's
picked
until
the
time
it
emerges
from
that
packing
plant
for
sale,
it
is
still
tobacco
leaf.
it
has
changed
from
green
to
brown
but
it's
still
tobacco.
it
has
--
had
no
manufacturing
process
to
which
it
has
been
subjected.
it
hasn't
been
stemmed.
it
hasn't
been
cooked.
in
short,
nothing
has
been
done
to
it
except
to
aid
the
natural
process
of
curing
and
it's
no
different
than
the
ripening
of
an
apple
or
the
ripening
of
a
tomato.
and
so,
i
want
to
implant
that
on
your
honors
minds.
that's
what
the
record
says.
there
can't
be
any
possible
question
about
it
as
far
as
the
may
company
is
concerned
and
i
now
turn
--
and
i
would
like,
your
honors,
to
parse
with
you
in
point
one
of
our
brief,
the
language
of
the
agricultural
exemption.
and
i
repeat,
it's
an
exemption
of
agriculture
and
it's
not
an
exemption
of
farming.
it's
a
much
broader
term.
and
what
does
--
what
does
section
3
say?
it
exempts
farming
in
all
its
branches
including
the
tillage
of
the
soil
plus
something
else
and
what
is
that
plus
something
else?
it's
any
practices
performed
by
a
farmer
and
here's
a
farmer,
that's
all
we
are
and
it's
conceded
that
the
operation
up
to
the
time
it
leaves
the
curing
barn
to
go
the
packing
plant.
it's
conceded
that
up
to
that
point
we're
within
the
exemption.
but
at
that
point,
where
--
these
are
practices
performed
by
a
farmer
as
an
incident
to
and
in
conjunction
with
the
farming
operations
and
what
are
they
in
this
case
including
preparation
for
market.
now,
in
our
case,
the
may
record,
the
record
is
transparently
clear
and
the
court
found
that
what
was
done
here
was
essential
for
the
marketing
of
our
tobacco.
and
our
tobacco
is
not
sold
until
all
that
process
has
been
completed
at
which
time
we
sell
it
to
cigar
manufacturers
who
use
it
for
cigar
wrapper.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
100
acres
is
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
yes.
so,
i
say,
your
honor,
under
the
plain
language
of
the
act,
we
are
covered.
now,
i
come
to
waialua
and,
your
honor,
waialua
is
not
--
this
is
not
an
a
fortiori
case.
waialua
as
we
construe
it
and
properly
read
supports
us
because
as
i
read
waialua,
the
big
thing
that
bothered
the
majority
of
this
court
was
that
there
was
an
actual
manufacturing
operation
involved.
in
that
case,
the
sugar
cane
was
actually
milled.
it
was
subjected
to
a
machining
process.
as
a
result
of
which,
it
was
transformed
into
two
other
substances,
namely,
raw
sugar
and
molasses.
now,
i
say
you
can't
fail
to
read
the
case
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
that
was
the
big
factor
that
influenced
the
majority
and
even
then,
they
said
that
it
was
a
borderline
case.
in
addition
to
that,
the
majority
opinion
listed
seven
factors
and
it
said,
“these
are
the
factors
you
use
in
--
in
trying
to
measure
whether
a
thing
is
farming
or
isn't
farming.
and
it's
the
totality
of
those
factors,
not
one
alone
that
counts
but
the
totality
of
them."
and
in
that
case,
the
--
as
i
remember
it,
waialua
failed
to
meet
three
of
the
seven
tests.
here,
we
meet
them
all
and
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
because
i
haven't
got
it
to
spell
them
out
except
to
say
that
on
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief,
we
very
tersely
describe
with
record
references
how
we
meet
every
single
one
of
those
tests.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
now
that
if
may
is
not
exempt,
then
the
language
practices
performed
by
a
farmer
as
an
incident
to
or
in
conjunction
with
such
farming
operations
including
preparation
for
market
as
that
appears
in
section
3
(f),
i
say
that
that
is
--
is
rendered
meaningless.
if
your
honors
say
that
we
aren't
covered
by
that,
then
i
can't
conceive
of
any
kind
of
agriculture
that
would
be
covered
by
it.
now
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
yes,
sir,
it
does.
and
i
--
i
remind,
your
honor,
that
in
our
case,
there
is
a
finding
that
it
was
essential
for
market.
mind
you,
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
it
has
to
be
essential
if
--
even
if
it
were
desirable
it
would
suffice.
but
there's
a
finding
here
that
what's
done
in
our
packing
plant
which
is
nothing
more
than
controlling
humidity
and
temperature
so
that
the
leaf
goes
through
this
natural
transformation.
that
is
all
by
way
of
preparation
for
market
because
we
don't
sell
until
all
that
has
been
done
and
the
--
and
the
cigar
manufacturer
doesn't
buy
from
us
until
that's
been
done.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
well,
your
honor,
the
record
is
that
in
our
case
it
--
it
is
the
--
the
packing
plant
is
10
miles
away
from
the
farm
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
--
but
that
--
that's
just
happenstance
actually.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
throw
--
true
but
that's
not
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
well,
it
--
it
could
be.
but
we
have
put
it
this
way.
if
we
did
not
have
our
own
packing
plant,
we
of
course
could
have
--
have
either
sold
or
made
arrangements
with
some
other
packing
plant
to
take
this
tobacco
of
ours
and
pile
it
and
re-pile
it,
this
pure
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
--
pure
and
simple
manual
operation
that
it
doesn't
involve
any
industrialization
whatever,
the
simplest
kind
of
manual
labor.
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
caught
the
flavor
of
your
honor's
question,
but
i
--
i
do
concede
that
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
--
i
do
concede
that
if
we
didn't
have
a
packing
plant,
we
could
have
had
our
--
had
our
tobacco
processed
by
others,
in
which
event,
i
think
if
we
had
those
people
who
got
it
would
come
within
the
section
13
(a)
(10)
exemption.
but
our
case
isn't
that
case.
we
do
our
own
bulking
and
i
repeat
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
what
the
statute
says,
"including
preparation
for
market.”
it
doesn't
say
that
--
that
you
must
--
in
other
words,
it's
not
a
mandatory
provision
here.
the
statute
says
that
it
suffices,
if
that
is
what
you
do
to
prepare
it
for
market
and
there's
no
question
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
exactly,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
well,
your
honors,
i
--
i'm
afraid
i've
trespassed
on
your
honors
time.
i
--
mr.
mark
f.
hughes
--
i
have
some
other
points,
i've
made
them
in
the
brief,
but
i'll
have
to
rest
on
the
brief.
