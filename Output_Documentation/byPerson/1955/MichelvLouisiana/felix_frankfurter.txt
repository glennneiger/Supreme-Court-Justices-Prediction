justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
that
is
the
practice
and
that
in
this
case,
that
practice
was
criminatory
disregarded?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
they
singled
out
this
on
the
next
day
as
the
practice
from
the
certain
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
your
duty
to
(inaudible),
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
throughout
state
against
wilson,
(inaudible)
your
legislature
as
(inaudible)
that's
what
202
means,
probably
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
the
purpose
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
construction
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
placed
upon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
we
bound
to
follow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
can
--
we
can
say
that
the
chief
justice
probably
was
right
and
the
court
was
wrong?
can
we
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
state
what
--
if
you
would
be
good
enough
to
state,
to
what
proposition
your
argument
(inaudible)
now
what
is
it
that
you're
going
to
argue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
time?
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
mean
between
the
second
and
the
third?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
not
yet
been
appointed
so
as
to
have
the
responsibility
of
taking
the
necessary
steps
for
defense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
thing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
well-known
fact
that
you
want
to
take
judicial
notice
that
they're
discriminating
your
--
the
negroes
that
kept
off
the
grand
jury
term?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
with
the
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
(inaudible)
about
the
wilson
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
your
legislature,
perhaps
the
statute
has
said
a
year
after
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
for
the
power
of
amending
the
criminal
code
--
criminal
procedure
of
louisiana.
is
that
the
effective
(inaudible)
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
have
to
have
it
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned.
it
may
violate
your
constitution
but
doesn't
violate
the
federal
constitution
for
you
to
have
only
two
branches
of
government.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
the
question
of
the
--
the
attack
on
the
petit
jury
is
also
involved
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
but
in
your
case,
it
isn't
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
sir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
thought
i
was
i
would
really
confirm,
there
is
in
this
case,
in
your
view,
the
michel
case,
no
challenge
for
the
petit
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
made
no
challenge
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
that
that
might
infer
therefore,
that
the
petit
jury
was
chosen
without
discrimination
because
of
absence
of
colored
people
--
people
under
them
at
that
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
so
mr.
schreiber
remarks
about
this
common
knowledge,
judicial
notice
that
he's
taking
that
there's
a
discrimination
affecting
the
(inaudible)
to
the
grand
jury?
but
when
it
comes
to
the
petit
jury
they
--
the
--
they're
no
observance
of
the
requirement
of
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
touching
on
that
but
what
is
interesting
to
me
is
that
i
evidently
may
rightfully
infer
to
what
you
said
that
there
is
observance,
few
observance
of
constitutional
requirement
against
discrimination
as
the
petit
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
sort
of
disturbs
my
assumption
that
louisiana
is
disregardful
of
the
duty
of
having
colored
people
in
the
part
of
the
administration
of
justice.
considering
the
fact,
one
would
expect
if
there's
is
going
to
be
discrimination
just
as
if
say--
whereas,
from
the
north,
i
actually
expect
more
discrimination
process
to
petit
jury
as
to
the
grand
jury.
it's
certainly
is
a
new
light
on
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
fust?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
got
the
impression,
perhaps
they're
only
(inaudible)
that
there
was
testimony
in
the
trial
court
before
judge
hertz
in
which
there
was
oral
testimony
both
by
mr.
schreiber
and
the
judge
himself,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
can
you
please
tell
me
where
i
could
find
that
in
this
man's
original
documents
which
is
the
bill
of
exception,
do
you
have
before
that
or
if
i
ask
the
clerk
to
handle
this
would
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
perhaps
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
there
is
--
is
printed,
isn't
it,
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
on
one
of
your
questions
about
--
i'll
try
to.
am
i
right
in
inferring
on
the
basis
of
symphonious
since
i've
been
here
that
the
term
of
grand
juries
is
apt
to
be
longer?
is
apt
to
be
rather
longer
in
southern
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long?
justice
felix
frankfurter
six
months?
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
cutoff
period
it's
varied
of
course
with
the
time
in
which
the
indictment
has
had
the
approval
--
the
indictment
is
handed
down
by
your
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
instead
of
having
a
fixed
time
with
reference
to
the
case,
you
would
get
a
--
you
have
a
general
arithmetic
term
with
reference
to
the
whole
term
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
this
statute,
but
that
there
is
--
does
this
grant
you
under
the
laws
of
the
other
southern
states
are
engaged
to
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
of
the
term
did
they
--
how
many
days
in
the
term
do
they
actually
exist?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
if
you
would
just
--
were
to
mention.
i
noticed
the
reading
in
the
wilson
case
in
the
report
that
counsel
--
one
of
the
counsel
for
the
state
was
mr.
hertz.
is
this
the
person
judge
hertz?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
he
knew
about
this
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
202,
the
whole
--
the
requirement
on
that.
he
was
counsel
in
the
wilson
case
which
dealt
with
this
problem
of
202.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
judge
hertz.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
judge
hertz.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
hertz?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
very
important
if
he
was
the
assistant,
if
he
is
the
same
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
ever
--
if
he
had
some
familiarity
with
the
problem
about
the
filing
the
requirement
of
where
and
the
challenge
to
be
arraigned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
wouldn't
mind
my
correction,
the
court
found
the
no
federal
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
it
approved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
anyway
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
merely
verbal
correction
sometimes
is
casually
complicated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
--
between
saying
that
the
federal
--
that
the
construction
placed
upon
your
statute
by
your
supreme
court,
it
raises
no
federal
question
and
a
specific
instant
in
which
an
otherwise
valid
statute
may
in
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
not
give
an
opportunity,
a
timely
opportunity
to
challenge
there's
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
particular
application
or
rather
a
particular
application
are
an
otherwise
valid
statute,
may
lay
the
federal
question
or
the
statue
itself
in
its
--
or
their
reapplication
was
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
that's
what's
involved
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'd
suppose
the
real
question
is
whether
we
can
say
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
couldn't
answer
that
question
in
the
way
that
you
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course
no
state
court
can
by
absence,
a
complete
absence
of
fact
and
saying
there's
a
fact
where
there
isn't.
or
by
distorting
what
obviously
lies
on
the
surface
of
the
record
and
calling
it
a
finding
of
fact
preclude
a
constitutional
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
to
say,
well,
he
preferred
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
speaking
for
myself.
i
don't
see
what
is
the
argument
about
they
--
that
--
that
202
had
been
construed
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
construed
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
out
of
(inaudible)
shows
that
construction
does
not
remotely
touch
his
federal
constitutional
rights.
what
is
there
to
argue
that
this
judicial
legislation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
judicial
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably,
that's
what
we'll
see
in
wilson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
presumably,
that
was
here
in
320
u.s.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
part
of
--
may
i
ask
before
you
sit
down
the
--
for
him
(inaudible)
what
is
the
volume
of
criminal
cases
in
your
parish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
are
up
for
arraignment
--
up
for
arraignment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
those
6000
or
7000
how
many
goes
to
a
different
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
10
--
10%?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
section
of
the
judge
presiding?
that's
rather
one
of
the
most
troublesome
a
phenomena
of
criminal
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
even
new
orleans
judges
play
what
--
play
the
judge's
presiding
to
that
extent
on
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
there's
a
truer
version.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
may
i
ask
you
this?
have
you
contended
and
are
you
now
contending
that
there's
a
practice
to
disregard
the
three-day
limit
of
which
and
that
this
case
is
a
discriminatory
failure
to
apply
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
contending
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
know
if
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
the
statute
--
the
implication
of
that.
whether
demurrer
filed
or
not
filed.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
you're
contending
that
this
case
is
a
discrimination,
meaning
by
that
a
conscious
refusal
or
even
mechanic
refusal
by
a
judge
not
to
apply
202
when
the
time
was
up
in
that
effect
is,
is
in
all
other
instances
such
litigation
is
allowed.
are
you
contending
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
it's
a
question
of
when
he
appointed
you.
the
question
is
assuming
that
literally,
technically,
arithmetically,
the
three
days
have
expired,
what
i'm
asking
is
whether
in
--
in
--
on
every
other
case
or
as
a
matter
of
habit,
the
course
of
business
before
the
criminal
courts
in
this
parish,
they
did
not
apply
202
as
it
applied
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
contending
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
telling
me,
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
in
every
other
case
that
they
disregarded
the
requirement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
make
that
position?
did
you
argue
that
before
the
supreme
court
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
argue
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
202
is
practically
a
dead
letter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
did
you
present
this
as
a
question
for
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
the
question
that
you
put
on
page
4
of
your
brief
in
this
main
argument
includes
the
fact
that
this
is
a
departure
from
our
norm
and
therefore
the
discrimination.
and
therefore
the
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
this
--
i'd
just
like
to
call
your
attention
to
state
the
--
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
last
february.
and
your
brief
was
filed
here
and
all
these
printer
form
and
what
the
judge
said
is
that
between
all
that
time,
the
reflection
on
the
case,
you
didn't
think
of
this
important
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
why
he
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
well
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
it
state
here?
now,
you
think
it's
a
point
of
great
importance.
you
say
you
had
it
in
mind
but
before
you
--
you
rejected
the
raising
of
it
but
now
you
think
it's
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
didn't
you
raise
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
you
didn't
reject
it
so
far
as
notice
to
this
court
is
concerned?
so
far
as
notice
for
the
state
is
concerned,
you
rejected
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
you
had
it
in
mind
but
you
didn't
--
decided
not
to
put
it
in
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
becker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
i'd
like
to
ask
you
why
you
stated
mr.
hubert
was
wrong
in
what
he
said
about
the
wilson
case.
you
said
he
was
wrong
in
stating
in
this
court
found
that
mr.
--
merely
denied
certiorari.
you
were
counsel
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
filed
an
appeal
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
have
the
records
before
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
filed
a
jurisdiction
of
statement
as
to
--
as
of
an
appeal
claiming
the
statute
as
unconstitutional.
the
state
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
appealed
from
the
supreme
court
per
curiam,
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed.
it's
a
period
of
the
decision
based
upon
a
nonfederal
ground
adequate
to
support
him.
i
am
bound
to
say
that
mr.
hubert
was
entirely
correct
on
what
he
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
is
the
court
said
there's
no
federal
question
in
attacking
that
statute.
justice

frankfurter
(voice

justice

where
and

now,
if
you
don't
need
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix

all
i'm
saying
is
that
he
stated
correctly
what
our

show

what
your

should

1950,

it?
isn't
that
right?
justice

1950?
he
wasn't
brought

when
did
the

rule

have
a

on

event?
justice

i'm
not
confused
with
anything.
i
want
to
know
when

i'm
confused
about
a
lot
of
things
and
not
about
the

i'm
about

i
want
to

when

to
trial
after
he
was
in
the
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
year
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
said
--
that
can't
be.
i'm
curious
to
know.
i
happened
to
have
an
interest
as
to
when
it
made
the
crime
be
brought
to
trial
with
the
--
to
the
instance
--
the
consequences
implications
of
failure
to
do
so.
it
was
decided
and
when,
in
december
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
about
the
jurisdiction
of
october,
1952,
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
i
understand,
all
right.
well,
now,
let's
find
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
third
thing
we
follow,
a
separate
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
to
say,
is
that
--
i
want
to
know
the
date
of
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
he
brought
to
trial?
when
was
this?
when
did
the
state
move
with
a
beautiful
trial
again?
that's
what
i
want
to
know,
part
of
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
happened
in
the
meantime?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
first
time
the
state
sought
to
bring
him
to
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
waited
another
year.
they
waited
for
the
other
codefendant.
you
don't
have
to
try
codefendants
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
justice
harlan's
question
becomes
relevant.
then
justice
harlan's
question
becomes
relevant.
how
do
you
know
that
counsel
may
not
have
thought
instead
of
that
pleading
on
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
can
this
--
how
can
i
get
this
feeling
from
mr.
mahoney
through
the
record,
the
fact
that
he
did
nothing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
brought
up
by
a
very
able
district
attorney
who
thought
being
told
before
than
one.
the
philosophy
of
the
prosecution
is
press,
press,
press
and
the
philosophy
of
the
defendant
is
delay,
delay,
delay
and
file
to
recover.
or
maybe
mr.
mahoney
was
brought
up
by
a
district
attorney
at
the
same
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
know,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
you
know
how
mr.
mahoney
felt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
they
can
--
everything,
whatever
desirable
to
inform
on
the
activities
when
i
get
to
be
able
to
inform
the
administration
within
six
months.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
see
how
any
of
these
former
district
attorneys
could
affect
this
file.
so,
i
wonder.
and
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
could
attribute
to
a
new
administration
the
fact
that
counsel
had
been
timely
at
end
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
to
just
as
you
did.
i
--
to
be
very
careful
not
to
--
with
respect
to
your
comment
to
your
administration.
and
i'm
wondering
why
there
should
have
been
a
change
by
the
situation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
differences
before
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
was
wondering
whether
if
that
was
in
the
record
in
your
(inaudible)
is
there
any
particular
reason
why
it
shouldn't
--
why
a
different
situation
should
be
revealed
in
the
theory
of
the
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
merely
suggest
that
that's
not
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
the
virtue
that
your
office
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
he's
just
indicated
--
he's
just
indicated
that
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
the
--
the
problem
should
have
been
discussed
had
any
illumination
at
all
on
that
little
theory.
and
that
in
any
illuminations
from
the
decision
of
this
court
which
are
(inaudible)
that
a
state
can
be
put
on
the
defendant
the
burden
of
proving
his
sanity
in
(inaudible)
on
the
extent
of
which
a
state
is
to
be
allowed
to
control
its
criminal
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
statute
of
limitation
said
you
can't
prosecuted
after
six
years
after
the
commission
of
the
crime.
but
if
he
--
if
he
could
say
--
to
say
that
nine
years,
he'd
be
prosecuted
nine
years
after
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
to
cut
off
of
50
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
in
its
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
a
legitimate
defense
to
its
crime?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
you
retreat
from
the
statute
of
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
was
a
perfect
defense
to
a
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
and
he
doesn't
go
to
the
man
--
it
goes
to
the
man
who
is
within
a
skip
only
by
one
day.
but
he
doesn't
go
to
a
man
for
a
year.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
fellow
distinguished
that
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
when
he
was
and
when
he
wasn't
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
--
consider
the
court
--
the
court
applies
the
constitution
to
apply
and
find
this
court.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
statute
in
louisiana?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
the
information
honoria?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
statute
refuted
the
when
--
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
see
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
is
your
presence
he
now
called
on
the
procedure
of
guide
is
still
around
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
prepared
to
state
as
a
matter
of
knowledge
that
in
every
case
during
last
10
years
in
which
a
negro
was
indicted
with
the
new
orleans
parish
was
supposed
to
be
applied
to
(inaudible)
constitutionality
of
the
grand
jury
at
that
time.

felix
frankfurter
