mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
at
the
time
the
judge
told
you
he
intended
to
appoint
you
that
he
also
said
he
was
going
to
appoint
some
other
lawyers?
chief

earl

also
to
defend
this
same
man?
chief

yes.
chief

mr.

chief
justice
earl

you
may
file
it.
chief

chief

john

versus
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
fust,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
appears
in
the
record,
mr.
fust?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
term?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
they
repudiate
wilson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
let
me
--
i
think
i
guess
i
didn't
understand
you.
do
you
mean
that
in
the
chianelli
case,
counsel
for
the
state
repudiate
wilson
versus
louisiana?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fust,
you
--
you
said
you
had
three
questions.
you
raised
two
of
them.
would
you
take
just
a
couple
of
minutes
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
raise
your
third
point
and
answer
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hubert.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
--
in
the
record,
mr.
hubert,
or
anything
within
your
knowledge
showing
how
many
negroes
on
the
average
are
among
those
thousand
that
go
into
the
box?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
what
is
the
system?
well
--
well,
the
question
that's
in
my
mind
is
this.
i
--
i
think
there's
some
--
in
one
of
these
cases
there's
the
statement
that
there
were,
i
think
6,
6
out
of
2500
in
the
in
--
in
the
box.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
find
those
and
there's
three
of
those
were
--
were
men
over
80
years
old
until
they're
unable
to
serve
these
jurors.
would
that
be
an
--
approximate
the
situation
or
would
it
be
entirely
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
--
was
this
a
case
in
which
they
offered
to
show
that
there,
there
were
only
six
in
the
panel
and
that
the
three
of
them
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
were
over
80?
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps,
it
might
be
one
of
the
other
case
that
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
try
to
find
out
if
there
were
such
a
custom
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
knew
about
what
business?
i
--
i
just
want
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
he
told
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
assist
and
not
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
not
be
on
a
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
--
is
there
any
question
about
the
fact
that
mr.
fust
was
appointed
on
the
fourth
day
after
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
that
wouldn't
make
--
that
wouldn't
be
very
informative
to
either
mr.
fust
or
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
his
associates
so
far
as
what
had
to
be
done
before
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why'd
he
appoint
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
he
appoint
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
was
--
was
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
mr.
schreiber
told
--
according
to
the
judge
at
the
time
he
appointed
him
that
he
was
going
to
appoint
mr.
fust
or
somebody
else
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
assist
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
he
was
--
he
was
appointed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
was
not.
he
was
not
appointed
on
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hubert,
as
--
as
i
understood
mr.
schreiber
when
he
was
in
court
on
the
2nd,
the
judge
said
to
him,
"i'm
going
to
appoint
you
to
represent
the
defendant
in
this
case.
and
i'm
also
going
to
appoint
some
other
lawyers
to
represent
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
at
that
time,
was
there
anything
said
about
appointing
him
just
to
assist
him
or
--
or
was
there
anything
to
infer
that
they
weren't
equals
in
--
in
the
case
and
acting
in
a
way
that
would
require
collaboration
between
them
as
to
what
they're
going
to
do
in
an
important
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that,
you're
saying?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
event
that
he
accepted
it,
now,
is
there
anything
in
there
to
show
that
on
this
occasion
mr.
schreiber
did
accept
it
on
the
2nd?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
it
is
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
but
this
says,
this
--
this
part
you
just
read
said
that
the
--
the
judge's
testimony
was
that
that
if
he
accepted
that
he
would
appoint
another.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
didn't
say
that
he
accepted
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hubert,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
assuming
that
--
that
mr.
schreiber
was
appointed
on
the
2nd
of
march
and
there's
no
controversy
about
that
at
all.
but
assuming
also
that
he's
--
he
did
not
do
anything
for
this
client
until
after
his
time
had
expired
whether
it
was
willfulness
or
neglect
or
whatever
it
might
have
been.
and
as
a
result
this
man
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
--
to
move
in
--
in
court
to
course
his
indictment,
would
he
have
had
effective
representation
of
counsel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
this
--
as
this
court
has
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that's
perfect
--
that's
perfectly
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
if
your
associate
is
going
to
answer
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
won't
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
mr.
schreiber
correctly
when
in
--
in
understanding
him
to
say
that
--
that
had
been
done
on
many
other
occasions,
was
being
done
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
when
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
permitted
them
to
make
this
--
make
this
afterwards.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duplantier.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
before
we
conclude
this
case
i'd
like
to
ask
mr.
--
mr.
schreiber
if
he
will
file
a
memorandum
concerning
those
cases
where
this
--
where
202
has
been
departed
from
as
you
--
as
you
mentioned
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
becker,
may
i
ask
you
concerning
this
practice
that
mr.
schreiber
has
spoken
of
as
to
--
to
the
applicability
of
section
202.
he
stated
you
were
more
familiar
than
--
than
he
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
--
mr.
becker
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
--
that
isn't
precisely
the
point
i
asked.
mr.
schreiber
said
that
since
the
wilson
case,
that
202
was
not
invoked
in
the
manner
it
was
--
has
been
invoked
in
this
case
and
under
these
circumstances.
and
he
cited
some
other
cases
and
--
and
he
said
inferentially
that
that
was
--
it
was
more
or
less
the
practice
not
to
--
not
to
invoke
it
in
circumstances
of
this
kind.
and
all
i
wanted
to
know,
he
--
he
admits
that
you
knew
the
practice
for
those
days
better
than
he
did.
and
i
--
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you
what
that
means?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
where
was
that
--
when
then
did
he
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
becker.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
becker.
mr.
hubert,
if
you
should
desire
to
--
to
answer
this
gentleman,
you
may
feel
free
to
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
hubert.
chief
justice
earl
warren
next
case
is
number
36,
clifton
alton
poret
verus
--
and
edgar
labat,
petitioners,
versus
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
lozes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
this
one,
the
other
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
offer
a
proof
as
to
how
he
left
and
why
he
left?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
confession
of
labat
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
take
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duplantier.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
--
would
it
be
consistent
with
your
argument
mr.
duplantier
to
address
yourself
to
this
last
case
first?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
is
there
any
statute
in
your
state
requiring
a
man
to
be
tried
within
a
given
number
of
days
and
yet
it's
according
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
proof
--
what
was
the
proof
of
being
a
fugitive?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
conceive
that
the
validity
of
your
position
depends
upon
whether
he
was
a
fugitive
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
didn't
know.
suppose
he
--
he
was
away
for
some
other
reason.
he
didn't
know
about
the
indictment
against
him.
would
your
--
would
you
still
maintain
your
present
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
different
theory.
i
--
i
suppose
in
new
orleans
police
department
like
most
police
departments
of
large
cities
have
clearly
hundreds
and
maybe
thousands
of
warrants
of
arrest
that
they
have
not
searched
for
one
reason
or
another.
and
would
you
say
that
in
all
those
cases
that
the
rights
of
the
defendants
are
--
are
running
their
rights
to
avail
themselves
of
the
full
procedure
set
up
by
louisiana
are
running
now
even
though
they
--
they
have
not
been
arrested
and
brought
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
that's
the
most
unusual
and
the
most
efficient
police
department
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
it
doesn't
have
hundreds
and
thousands
even
of
--
of
warrants
somewhere
in
--
in
the
police.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
experince
--
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
many
indictments
does
your
grand
jury
return
in
a
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
75
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
whatever
kind
of
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
between
50
and
75?
chief
justice
earl
warren
up
to
30
in
a
year?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
mention
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
--
i
would
like
--
just
one
more
question
and
i
hope
not
to
bother
you
anymore
during
your
argument.
but
suppose
a
man
was
indicted
on
the
last
day
of
the
term.
and
for
some
reason
or
other
whether
it
was
the
inactivity
of
the
sheriff
or
activity
on
the
part
of
the
--
the
person
who
is
accused
or
whatever
it
might
be,
for
some
reason
or
other,
a
warrant
was
not
served
for
four
days.
then
the
defendant
was
arrested
and
brought
into
court,
would
it
be
incumbent
upon
him
to
establish
that
he
had
not
been
trying
to
avoid
arrest
during
those
three
to
four
days
in
order
to
be
--
to
have
available
to
him,
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
for
the
reasons
that
you're
here
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
there
any
statute
in
--
in
louisiana
that
specifically
says
that
a
man
shall
lose
any
rights
while
he
is
avoiding
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we'd
have
to
do
that
with
the
man
who
wasn't
arrested
for
four
days
would
he
leave.
he
was
to
have
the
opportunity
to
--
to
make
such
a
motion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
just
locked
himself
up
in
his
house
and
--
and
refused
to
admit
anyone.
then
and
that
it
went
on
for
three
or
four
days
and
until
the
fourth
day
after
the
grand
jury
was
adjourned,
you
would
think
that
he
could
be
deprived
of
his
right
to
make
such
a
motion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
want
to
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
by
reward?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
get
that.
but
i
get
back
to
the
question
that
justice
black
who
asked
you.
do
you
know
of
any
statute
in
any
state
that
deprives
a
--
an
accused
person
of
any
rights
he
may
have
on
his
trial
or
the
procedure
leading
up
to
it
because
he
is
a
fugitive
from
justice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
could
just
well
say
--
if
you
could
just
well
say
that
if
he
wasn't
indicted
it
seems
to
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
--
your
don't
say
anything
about
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
no.
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
duplantier,
does
the
court
say
that
he
did
anything?
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
man
--
man
can
be
an
able,
conscientious
lawyer
and
he
might
under
given
circumstances
do
nothing
for
--
now
all
i
ask
is
and
i
don't
argue
and
all
i'll
ask
you
is
what
does
the
record
show
that
he
did
for
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
offer
the
observation
that
when
mr.
mahoney
did
that,
he
wouldn't
be
--
be
the
able,
conscientious,
upright
lawyer
that
the
supreme
court
said
he
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
honorable
opportunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
have
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
this
is
your
time
now
after
--
i
think
you
have
some
time
left
gentlemen,
a
little.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
schreiber,
justice
frankfurter
had
one
question
he
wanted
to
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
what
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
harlan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
want
to
say
anything
to
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
all
right,
gentlemen.
