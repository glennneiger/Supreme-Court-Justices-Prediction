mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
yes.
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
handled
the
wilson
case.
i
applied
to
this
court.
my
learned
counsel
on
the
other
side
is
--
is
in
error.
he
read
the
report
that
this
court
dismissed
an
appeal.
this
court
never
granted
certiorari
in
the
wilson
case.
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
certiorari
was
refused
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
federal
question
involved
in
the
interpretation
of
article
202
of
the
louisiana
court
of
criminal
procedure
at
that
time
which
is
now
the
revised
statutes
of
louisiana.
and
it's
taken
right
out
word
for
word.
there
wasn't
--
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
said
in
refusing
the
writ
of
certiorari
that
there
was
no
federal
question
involved.
that
the
state
had
the
right
to
interpret
its
own
statutes
as
long
as
that
interpretation
was
not
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
an
accused.
i
think
that
is
the
point
on
this
saying.
but
i
might
say
this
that
throughout
the
wilson
case,
is
the
first
time
that
article
202
was
ever
invoked
against
any
defendant,
white
or
colored,
in
louisiana.
that's
the
only
time
it
was
ever
invoked
to
my
knowledge
after
28
years
of
criminal
law
practice.
202
was
only
invoked
for
the
first
time
in
the
wilson
case.
learned
counsel
on
the
other
side
cannot
cite
a
case
from
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
which
article
202
of
the
court
of
criminal
procedure
was
ever
invoked
until
the
wilson
case.
now,
in
as
far
as
the
procedure
which
the
different
justices
have
asked
counsel
in
louisiana,
we
have
a
system
in
louisiana
of
selecting
grand
juries
and
petit
juries
which
does
not
--
is
not
the
same
as
in
other
states.
now,
up
until
the
case
of
pierre
--
pierre,
there
were
no
negroes
ever
served
on
petit
juries
or
grand
juries
in
louisiana.
it
was
the
pierre
case
which
is
the
case
that
came
from
the
24th
judicial
district
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
parish
of
jefferson,
in
which
this
court
forced
the
state
of
louisiana
to,
at
least,
put
the
names
of
colored
people
on
the
petit
jury.
the
state
of
louisiana,
never
at
any
time,
put
a
colored
person
on
any
jury,
petit
or
grand
jury.
and
in
the
cases
of
pierre
versus
state
of
louisiana,
this
court
forced
the
state
of
louisiana
to
put
colored
people
on
the
petit
juries.
now,
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
is
to
have
the
state
of
louisiana
do
the
same
thing
in
as
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned.
and
each
time
that
there
is
a
case
in
which
that
is
invoked,
they
come
up
and
use
202
since
the
wilson
case.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
in
my
--
my
humble
opinion,
i
think
that
the
decision
in
the
wilson
case
was
a
decision
to
deny
to
wilson
his
constitutional
rights
and
of
due
process
of
law
because
if
that
statute,
with
all
due
respect,
had
been
interpreted
as
written
to
deny
him
the
right
to
question
the
grand
jury
would
certainly
have
been
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law
and
had
been
unconstitutional.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
article
202
has
been
invoked
except
about
three
cases.
and
strange
as
it
may
seem,
that
in
each
one
of
those
case,
the
defendant
is
a
colored
person.
and
each
time
it's
been
invoked,
it's
been
attacked.
an
attack
has
been
made
upon
the
grand
jury
that
filed
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
because
no
colored
person's
won
the
grand
jury.
and
that's
the
only
time
to
my
knowledge
in
louisiana
that
it
has
been
used.
now
--
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
in
the
chianelli
case
--
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
in
the
chianelli
case
which
is
a
white
man,
counsel
for
chianelli
used
the
--
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
to
walk
in
the
morning
of
the
trial
and
file
his
motion
to
quash.
that's
what
he
did.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
he
did
it
the
morning
of
the
trial.
that
chianelli
was
coming
to
trial
--
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
--
and
the
judge
--
the
trial
judge
in
--
in
the
chianelli
case
said,
"oh,
no.
the
--
i'm
not
going
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
state
versus
wilson
because
that
applied
--
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
was
--
was
referring
to
grand
juries
and
not
to
petit
juries
and
i'm
going
to
overrule
your
motion
to
quash
this
indictment.‚Äù
that's
the
situation.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
yes,
justice
frankfurter?
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
no,
i
filed
an
application
for
writs
of
certiorari,
sir.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
dismissed.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
meant
to
say
this,
justice
frankfurter.
that
there
was
no
writ
of
certiorari
granted
that
i
know
of
in
that
case.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
it
was
an
appeal.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
i
agree
with
you.
i
agree
that's
what
--
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
--
the
court
said,
yes.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
the
wilson
case.
this
court
said
that
there
was
no
federal
--
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
well,
i
mean
in
the
matter
that
he
said
that
there
was
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted.
and
then
it
was
dismissed.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
that's
what
i
meant
for
the
--
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
--
that
he
was
wrong.
mr.
rudolph
f.
becker,
jr.
oh,
yes.
that
there
was
no
federal
--
federal
question
involved.
that's
exactly
what
this
court
has
held.
