justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
in
open
court
when
he
said
on
appointing
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
came
through
the
mail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
motions
filed
down
there
very
often?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
any
of
them
filed
when
you
--
you're
assistant
district
attorney?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
statute
require
that
notice
be
passed
on
the
attorney's
appointment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
that's
just
accustomed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
custom
of
that
written
notice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
was
--
why
was
he
served
with
notice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
seems
that
the
judge
introduced
her
to
mr.
schreiber
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
understand
the
record
is
that
she
--
the
judge
introduced
her
to
mr.
schreiber
and
told
her
on
march
the
2nd,
this
is
the
lawyer
i
appointed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
judge
went
further,
he
said
on
that
same
day,
march
the
2nd
as
you
said
to
me
that
mr.
schreiber,
if
you
don't
mind
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
case
but
you
might
obtain
the
arraignment
to
give
me
another
week
(inaudible)
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
on
march
the
2nd?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
altogether
be
correct
to
says
that
there
are
only
three
days
if
you
accept
the
judge's
statement
as
correct
as
here
he
said
on
march
2nd,
to
mr.
schreiber,
according
to
the
judge,
he
told
him
that
he's
going
to
appoint
him
and
so
forth.
and
that
mr.
schreiber
had
said
--
asked
him
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
look
it
over
and
continue
the
matter
for
a
week.
and
what
was
the
object
in
continuing
it
for
a
week
to
give
them
in
that
question
up
till
he
look
it
over?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
makes
you
get
ready
to
see
what
he
would
want
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
true
and
maybe
that's
the
letter
of
the
law.
what
if
the
lawyer
was
in
and
they're
talking
about
this
point,
they've
been
talking
about
this
point.
and
the
judge
says,
"i'm
going
to
ask
of
the
--
has
told
the
(inaudible)
maybe
you
got
to
get
a
lawyer.
and
they
didn't
get
a
lawyer.
and
then
he
tells
him
he
hadn't
got
any.
and
the
lawyer
says,
well,
i'd
like
to
have
it
put
it
in
the
open.
he
says,
well,
i
am
going
to
appoint
somebody
else
to
help
you.
and
he
does
put
it
off
to
him.
i
would
think
that
most
lawyers
under
those
circumstances
would
think
that
the
matter
was
over
for
a
week.
and
they
--
they
had
a
right
to
ignore
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
thing
nothing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
except
consider
whether
or
not
what
they
would
do
and
--
and
particularly
when
the
appointment
comes
later
in
writing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
after
your
appointment
comes
in
writing,
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
entirely
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you'll
look
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you'll
look
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
record,
of
course,
you
don't
claim
of
that
record
but
not
be
explained
by
what
the
testimony
shows
on
the
other
pages.
at
page
35,
do
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(inaudible)
have
to
take
it
exactly
as
it
says
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
get
--
what
i
get
from
this
statement
on
35
that
she
has
a
question
that
--
that
he
didn't
know
exactly
as
he
stands
and
appointed
definitely
but
he
says
now,
i'm
going
to
appoint
you.
he
said,
well,
give
me
a
week
that
an
opportunity
to
look
it
over.
well
then
i
suppose
an
opportunity
to
look
it
over
is
an
opportunity
to
look
it
over.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
that
even
the
judge
says
he
had
been
in
since
february
23rd.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge
said
he
had
discussed
the
matter
with
him
cursorily
--cursorily
right
after
the
date
of
the
first
arraignment
which
was
february
23rd.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
came
there
without
a
counsel
but
he
didn't
claim
the
appointment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
not
a
new
matter.
and
that
if
--
if
there
was
a
new
matter
insofar
as
whether
he
was
definitely
from
that
moment,
charged
to
the
fixed
responsibility
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
it
also
means
in
perjury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i'd
suppose
that
the
question
of
whether
under
the
circumstances
here,
taking
it
all
into
consideration,
in
this
said,
that
we
have
to
say
that
he
was
charged
with
the
responsibility
there
at
the
time
when
the
court
told
him
he
had
a
week
to
file
the
papers
so
that
his
prime
interest
--
final
interest
in
the
law
in
case
he
didn't
do
it.
and
i
don't
see
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
me
that
what
it'd
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
that
that
is
required.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
understand
that
we
have
a
right
to
consider
the
circumstances
on
constitutional
question.
and
that
we
are
not
bound
only
by
what
the
supreme
court
and
the
state
says
in
its
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
any
cases
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
fell
on
questions
of
circumstances
and
the
effect
as
it
with
the
relation
to
a
man's
constitutional
protection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise,
i
think
this
court
said
that
you
--
we
don't
have
chance
to
protect
the
constitution
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
reading
the
right
at
all
in
many
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
were
mistaken
--
suppose
they
were
mistaken,
they
had
taken
away
from
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
of
any
statutory
provisions
in
louisiana
with
reference
to
the
selection
of
juries
or
grand
juries
or
motions
to
be
made
in
connection
with
the
things
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
it
has
never
been
held
--
where
--
where
it
never
been
held
that
they
could
not
be
waived?
i
would
be
surprised
if
it's
other
than
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
usually
with
reference
to
the
motions
so
that
the
grand
jury
and
the
venire
and
so
forth,
either
sides
can
waive
all
of
these.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
what
i
had
in
mind
was
this.
will
that
suppose
that
you
had,
has
been
the
prosecuting
attorney
at
this
time
and
you
said,
well,
times
up
or
that
the
--
we're
going
to
waive,
we're
going
to
let
you
make
that
motion
in
6
days
or
10
days.
and
you
had
gone
through
this.
do
you
have
any
doubt?
do
you
think
there's
any
possibility
that
the
state
supreme
court
would
avail
that
you
couldn't
waive
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
this.
and
--
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
what
i
mean
is
that
that
kind
of
proceeding
with
reference
to
view
this,
with
a
motion
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
ordinarily
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
--
perhaps
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
that
there,
speaking
of
the
circumstances
that
if
--
if
this
particular
defendant
has
had
no
--
conceding
that
as
assumed.
he
had
no
lawyer
hired,
no
lawyer
appointed
and
the
time
expires.
what
--
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
we
didn't
hold
in
the
avery
case
that
a
rigid
law
to
that
effect
would
have
complied
with
due
process.
it
--
it
was
in
the
nature
of
examining
the
circumstances
such
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
a
while
ago
in
connection
to
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
it
was
applied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
must
mean
by
6000
or
7000
to
include
misdemeanor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
indictments
in
louisiana
secret?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
when
they
have
not
been
arrested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that
somebody
has
notified
poret?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
warrant
of
arrest
served
on
poret?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
served?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
was
that
after
the
time
that
it
expired
with
the
one
--
within
which
he
could
filed
the
motion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
try
him,
but
you
can't
set
up
your
defense.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
many
times
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
would
be
cut
off
of
his
constitutional
defense,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
he
didn't
plead
his
constitutional
defense
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
he
was
arrested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
many
of
those
files?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
three
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
support
the
state
statute
that
accomplished
the
same
result
by
providing
that
any
man
indicted
for
rape
or
murder,
who
flees
from
this
jurisdiction
knowing
that
there
is
an
indictment
against
him
stays
away
for
a
year
shall
not
be
permitted
to
plead
or
file
any
charge
that
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
him
was
formed
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
valid
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you'd
have
to
take
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
accomplishes
that
result.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
say
that,
of
course,
if
they
had
provided
that
the
man
who
pled
should
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
plead
self
defense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
draw
a
distinction
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
attempts
on
the
merit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
defense
that
the
grand
jury
had
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
what
--
the
same
thing
would
apply
if
i
would
ask
you
the
question
if
he's
going
to
be
tried
by
a
judge.
and
it
was
provided
that
any
man
who,
i
suppose,
any
man
who
plead
knowing
that
he
was
charged
by
for
the
crime
that
he
waived
the
privilege
of
telling
him
to
apply
some
prejudice
of
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
be
different
because
they
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
another
difference
that
he
put
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
one
of
them
is
that
he
would
be
tried
by
this
judge
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
other
is
that
it's
an
indictment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
whatever
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
do
you
think
it's
not
a
legitimate
defense,
a
right
to
legitimately
defend
yourself
in
carrying
the
jury
best
put
it
on
another
(inaudible)
remedy
and
remember
that
the
relation
of
the
person
to
it
is
conducted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
the
grand
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
of
course,
the
statute
of
limitation
provides
that
the
set
by
aside
would
wait
for
something
to
happen.
you
don't
try
to
do
anything
that
you
then
waive
the
right.
you
--
you
can
be
positive.
you
--
you
just
do
that.
you
can
trust
that
statute
of
limitation
with
that.
but
if
you
have
--
if
you
get
away
and
make
it
is
impossible
to
try
that
that's
to
prosecute.
the
point
i
want
to
know,
but
evidence
said
that
even
a
similar
criminal
case
that
can
cut
off
the
man's
right
to
defend
himself
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
a
certain
ground
that
the
law
allowed
to
defend
either
with
reference
to
the
merits
of
the
crime
or
with
reference
to
the
validity
of
the
procedure
above
the
due
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
outside
of
this
one
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
appointment
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
case
of
which
calls
for
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
as
if
you'd
just
filed
it
and
had
to
get
a
new
indictment
it's
likely
to
have
a
later
number
and
to
be
tried
later
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
be
a
new
case
and
it'd
take
its
place
along
with
the
new
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
that
law?
