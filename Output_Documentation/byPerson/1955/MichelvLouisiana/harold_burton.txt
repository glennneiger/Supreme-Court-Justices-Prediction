justice
harold
burton
suppose
we
heard
the
opinion
that
the
judges
per
curiam
stated
was
correct
that
you
were
appointed
on
may
the
2nd.
would
it
be
a
denial
of
due
process
that
you
only
had
three
days
in
which
to
file
this
motion?
justice
harold
burton
concerning
the
fact
that
louisiana
apparently
has
held
that
it
is
reasonable.
justice
harold
burton
but
you
had
three
days
after
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
in
which
to
file?
justice
harold
burton
you
had
three
days
after
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
in
which
to
file?
justice
harold
burton
now,
if
you
had
been
appointed,
do
you
think
it
was
--
three
days
was
not
enough
if
we're
to
recognize
due
process?
justice
harold
burton
of
passing
what?
justice
harold
burton
but
of
course
that
doesn't
mean
this
that
you
point
out
you
did
nothing
between
the
second
and
the
fifth.
you
started
on
the
--
on
the
fifth
and
you
completed
your
motion
within
four
days
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
you
say
you
didn't
have
them
before?
so
if
you'd
started
on
the
second,
you
ended
on
the
fourth?
justice
harold
burton
well,
you
took
two
days
actually
to
file
it?
justice
harold
burton
you
took
two
days?
justice
harold
burton
well,
if
you'd
started
on
the
second,
you
had
been
done
on
the
fourth?
justice
harold
burton
have
those
other
articles
been
repealed?
justice
harold
burton
you
want
us
to
overrule
wilson?
justice
harold
burton
on
the
grand

justice
harold

jury
panel.
justice
harold

justice
harold

(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
mr.
hubert,
you
referred
to
page
6
of
your
brief.
did
you
file
a
brief
in
this
case?
justice
harold
burton
i
see.
justice
harold
burton
and
do
nothing?
justice
harold
burton
on
page
3
of
the
record,
the
minute
of
the
court
shows
that
the
court
appointed
mr.
schreiber
to
represent
the
defendant
in
this
matter.
on
motion
of
the
defendant,
the
court
ordered
arraignment
to
continue
to
--
to
march
the
9th,
who
made
the
motion
for
the
defendant?
justice
harold
burton
he
must
have
been
acting
then
on
march
the
2nd?
justice
harold
burton
if
the
--
if
the
record
purports
to
speak
verity.
justice
harold
burton
nor
do
they
have
to
be
deliberate.
justice
harold
burton
when
did
it
run
out,
do
you
mind?
justice
harold
burton
(voice

--
justice
harold
burton
under
the
statute
in
the
wilson
case
he
had
until
march
8,
1951,
is
that
it?
justice
harold
burton
now,
is
that
your
contention
because
he
didn't
know
about
it
that
therefore
he
gets
extra
time
justice
harold
burton
do
you
--
do
you
take
the
same
position
whether
he
was
within
the
state
or
outside
of
the
state?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
no,
i
mean
he's
up
in
the
hills
and
doesn't
hear
about
it?
justice
harold
burton
well
does
--
does
everybody
who
stays
away
in
the
hills
therefore
get
--
get
extra
time,
but
if
they
--
if
they
stay
downtown
they
don't?
justice
harold
burton
how
much
time
was
he
given?
justice
harold
burton
how
much
time
would
you
give
him,
three
days
after
he
gets
back,
or
what?
justice
harold
burton
that
was
in
the
case
--
justice
harold
burton
--(voice

--
that
the
man
never
could
be
tried,
but
in
this
case,
you
could
be
re-indicted.
justice
harold
burton
i
say
any
case
which
you've
just
recited
to
justice
black,
man
never
could
be
into
tried.
but
in
--
in
the
case
we
have
here,
the
man
could
be
re-indicted.
justice
harold
burton
that's
to
a
different
situation.
justice
harold
burton
well,
mr.
mahoney
couldn't
they
have
gotten
anything
much
by
delay
by
filing
to
court
--
justice
harold
burton
--
but
he's
been
getting
of
that
as
it
was.
justice
harold
burton
what
could
mr.
mahoney
--
what
could
mr.
mahoney
that
will
accept
the
--
in
quashing
in
this
indictment?
justice
harold
burton
that
was
mean
of
the
man's
reindictment.
justice
harold
burton
yes.
(inaudible)was
a
little
time.
justice
harold
burton
and
possibly
he
would
too.
justice
harold
burton
he
might
get
a
constitution
white
grand
jury
the
second
time
too.
