justice
tom
c.
clark
they
impel
a
new
grand
jury
when
the
old
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
one
impaneled
that
day
in
court
when
you're
there?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
notice
is
not
in
the
record?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you're
depending
on
your
appointment
being
effective
on
the
sixth.
that's
right
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
or
fifth.
why
didn't
you
put
the
notice
in
the
record?
it
would
show
when
you
were
served.
well,
then
you'd
have
support
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
fact
might
be
possible
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
does
the
record
show
particular
circumstances
of
which
poret
asked
louisiana?
i've
read
the
opinion
of
the
court.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand
what
they
say
is
there.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
was
--
does
the
record
show
that
he
was
known
immediately?
justice
tom
c.
clark
from
the
word
fugitive
from
(inaudible)
case
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
that
he
was
a
fugitive
from
justice?
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
was
alleged
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
when
was
labat
arrested?
justice
tom
c.
clark
labat
was
arrested
almost
immediately.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
was
the
order
--
he
gets
arrested
before
his
indictment?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
record
--
the
record
show
why
they
arrested
labat
or
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes
i
know
but
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
because
he
was
identified
by
the
victim?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
don't
know
why
it's
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
is
the
--
and
he
didn't
asked
before
the
expiration
of
the
time
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
already?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
on
what
statute
or
what
court
decision
do
you
base
your
computation
of
the
--
of
the
extra
time?is
there
any
authority
for
that
or
just
that
he
should
have
reasonable
time?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
if
on
your
theory,
it
--
it
does
take
all
of
the
sharpness
out
of
the
wilson
case
not
and
the
statute.
i
mean,
it
just
varies
with
the
information
getting
to
the
--
to
the
accused
person.
if
mr.
schreiber's
man
hadn't
--
hadn't
heard
about
it
why
he
wouldn't
be
--
he
wouldn't
have
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
would
that
not
make
your
rule
then
if
the
--
if
he
--
he
must
answer
within
the
term
of
the
grand
jury
or
three
days
thereafter
or
such
later
time
as
he
hears
about
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
so,
that's
merely
in
interest
of
orderly
trial
of
the
case
so
that
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
out
of
the
way
before
he's
post
the
merits?
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
did
you
put
in
on
the
basis
that
you
had
no
knowledge?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
with
which
anything
has
ever
held
that
a
man
must
be
to
the
charge
of
(inaudible)
before
his
arrested?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
know
of
any
--
any
other
state
that
this
is
the
rule
had
been
held
because
a
man
pleads
he
can
be
penalized
in
his
defense
although
he
could
be
prosecuted
in
court
and
convicted
for
pleading
(inaudible)
do
you
know
of
any
answer
in
which
in
the
state
held
for
inference
the
he
could
be
deprived
of
setting
up
an
appeal
except
(inaudible)
on
the
ground
that
he
hadn't
filed
it
while
he
was
pleading?
justice
tom
c.
clark
or
that
he
had
--
he
has
any
--
couldn't
plead
not
guilty
unless
he
filed
--
unless
he
pleaded
not
guilty
while
he
was
pleading?
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
did
you
put
it
on
the
basis
of
knowledge.
i
would
suppose
that
he
has
the
right
to
be
notified
at
the
time
will
include
the
right
of
that
procedure
or
had
to
be
informed
of
it
under
the
constitution
to
have
some
concern
on
it
would
include
the
right
to
file
your
defenses
at
that
time,
whatever
they
are.
and
we're
not
just
talking
about
shifting
it
on
the
basis
of
whether
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
(voice
overlap)
--
seek
the
information
outside,
the
fact
he's
not
arrested.
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
he's
not
in
a
jury.
what
does
that
help?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
would
suppose
your
defense
if
you
had
any
would
be
to
help
the
man
that
hasn't
been
arrested.
he
hasn't
--
that
he's
not
charged
with
the
crime,
informs
him
by
arrest.
and
yet
they
say
is,
before
he's
arrested,
he's
already
waived
the
defense
on
a
constitutional
ground.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
defense
does
he
have?
if
--
if
it
could
be
done
on
this,
why
couldn't
it
be
done
on
self-defense?
justice
tom
c.
clark
unless
the
jury
provided
that
he
has
to
file
a
plea
of
self-defense
and
its
reasonable
time
which
can
be
done.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
then,
that
he's
not
arrested.
and
he
doesn't
file
it
within
that
number
of
days
or
that
number
of
months.
and
the
court
comes
along
and
said,
"well,
you
can't
file
that
plea
of
self-defense.
you
have
pled.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
court
found
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
those
all
are
capital,
the
30?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
police
serves
--
does
the
police
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
we
can
put
or
obtain
on
that
with
the
police
but
maybe
the
--
detain
this
man
behind
the
process?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes
and
that
is
that
he
--
he
can
still
be
prosecuted.
now,
tell
us
the
statute
anywhere
from
this
--
in
this
country,
in
any
state
of
the
union
or
the
federal
statute
which
says
that
in
addition
to
not
being
able
to
escape
prosecution,
he
shall
have
legitimate
defensive
and
cut
it
off
which
the
constitution
provided
to
him.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
have
they
tried
to
separate
on
this?
