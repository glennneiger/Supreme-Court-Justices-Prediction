mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
(inaudible)
by
the
grand
jury
in
1950.
he
was
not
informed
of
the
indictment
against
him.
he
was
not
arrested
on
the
alleged
crime
until
october
of
1952.
the
time
had
proscribed
--
long
proscribed
when
he
was
arrested
and
brought
to
the
jurisdiction,
the
court
of
louisiana
jurisdiction.
that
was
a
year
and
seven
months.
the
time
had
expired
already
when
he
was
placed
in
the
parish
prison.
when
he
was
placed
in
the
parish
prison,
the
case
was
set
for
arraignment
for
october
25th.
he
was
brought
down
the
3rd
of
october.
he
was
set
for
the
25th
of
october,
1952
and
i
was
retained
the
afternoon
of
the
24th.
so,
on
the
morning
of
the
25th,
on
arraignment,
i
went
to
court.
and
i
asked
the
court
for
a
continuance
of
the
arraignment
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
me
to
file
pleadings
in
the
case.
on
--
the
court
granted
me
until
november
7,
1952
to
file
those
pleadings.
on
november
the
7th,
1952,
we
appeared
in
court
and
we
filed
our
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
the
--
when
we
filed
the
motion
to
quash
the
indictment,
the
state
asked
for
a
continuance.
and
the
court
granted
them
until
november
17th
to
their
continuance
to
answer
of
filing
the
pleadings
in
answer
to
my
motion
to
quash.
on
november
--
on
november
17th,
1952,
the
state
filed
its
demurrer
to
my
motion
to
quash
claiming
that
the
--
the
motion
was
filed
too
late.
now,
the
only
difference
between
my
case
and
the
case
of
michel
and
labat
is
that
my
client
poret
wasn't
even
arrested.
he
didn't
have
counsel
at
the
time
that
--
the
time
limit
expired.
he
had
three
days
after
march
the
5th,
1951.
that
is
until
march
the
8th.
he
had
until
march
the
8th,
1951,
to
file
his
motion
to
quash
under
article
202
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
that
the
man
was
not
arrested.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
he
was
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
that's
--
that's
correct,
sir.
yes,
sir.
he
was
in
a
penitentiary
in
tennessee
during
the
part
of
that
time.
and
the
state
of
louisiana
attempted
to
get
him
back
from
the
penitentiary
of
tennessee.
and
the
state
of
tennessee
refused
the
extradition
and
said
that
he
would
have
to
stay
there
until
he
served
his
time.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
what's
that,
sir?
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
labat
was
tried
with
correct
judgments.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
filed
a
motion
for
a
severance
and
the
district
attorney
took
the
witness
stand
and
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
use
a
confession.
i
filed
my
motion
on
the
ground
that
labat
had
committed
--
confessed.
and
he
had
involved
poret
in
his
confession.
that
was
the
basis
to
my
motion
for
a
severance.
and
when
the
district
attorney
took
the
witness
stand
and
said
he
was
not
going
to
use
a
confession
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
there
was
no
need
for
a
motion
for
a
severance
because
that
was
the
basis
of
my
motion,
was
that
they
were
going
to
use
confession
of
labat.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
actually
--
actually
sir,
i
would
say
yes.
but
the
case
against
labat
was
fixed
for
trial
two
or
three
times
before
poret's
incarceration
or
his
arrest.
the
case
was
fixed
for
trial.
i
think
at
one
time,
according
to
the
record,
while
poret
was
in
the
penitentiary
in
tennessee.
and
it
was
continued
one
time
by
the
state
i
believe
and
one
time
by
the
defense,
if
that
answers
justice
clark's
question.
but
in
this
case,
in
poret's
case,
he
had
no
opportunity,
whatsoever,
to
file
his
motion
to
quash
before
the
time
limit
expired.
under
our
jurisdiction,
the
purpose
of
an
arraignment
is
to
inform
the
accused
of
what
he
is
being
tried
for.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
arraignment.
is
to
inform
him
of
the
case
and
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him.
so,
that
i
say
that
in
the
case
of
poret
that
he
was
denied
due
process
of
law.
this
much,
as
the
time
limit
had
expired
a
long
time,
a
year
and
seven
months
before
he
was
ever
brought
to
the
jurisdiction
of
louisiana.
and
surely
while
he
was
in
the
penitentiary
in
tennessee,
he
couldn't
obtain
counsel
to
defend
the
case
in
louisiana.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
it
--
the
--
the
only
thing
i
know,
sir
is
this
that
they
look
for
poret
and
couldn't
find
him,
that's
all
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
that
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
looked
for
poret
two
days
after
the
alleged
crime
was
--
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
i
think
that's
what
the
record
discloses.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that
he
was
a
fugitive
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
the
state
urged
that
he
lost
his
rights
because
he
was
a
fugitive
from
justice.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
put
poret.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
the
state
offered
no
proof
any
further
than
the
show
that
sheriff
went
to
poret's
mother's
home
where
poret
was
supposed
to
have
lived.
and
that
upon
inquiries,
he
was
told
that
poret
was
not
there.
he
went
back
a
second
time
looking
for
poret
and
was
told
again
that
poret
was
not
there
and
that
they
hadn't
seen
poret.
but
the
state
offered
no
evidence,
whatsoever,
to
show
why
poret
if
he
left
--
left
the
jurisdiction
all
of
that
the
city
in
new
orleans.
they
showed
--
didn't
show
a
--
there's
no
scintilla
of
evidence
to
show
why
he
left.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
indictments
are
not
secret
sir.
they
are
brought
in
by
the
grand
jury
they
filed
in
court.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
even
when
they
haven't
been
arrested.
they're
filed
in
the
clerk's
office
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
code.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
the
defendant
is
--
we
call
it
capias.
it's
warrant
under
the
common
law.
it's
a
warrant
of
arrest.
when
the
indictment
is
brought
in
by
the
grand
jury,
it's
recorded
in
the
court.
and
a
warrant
of
arrest
or
a
capias
issues
for
the
--
for
the
arrest
of
the
individual
who
is
indicted.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
it
was
attempted
to
be
served
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
it
was
never
served,
except
in
the
penitentiary
in
tennessee.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
one
year
--
one
year
and
the
seven
months
after
the
time
expired
for
him
to
file
his
motion
under
article
202.
that
the
facts
are
in
on
page
3
and
4
of
my
brief.
we
set
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
what's
that
sir?
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
almost
immediately,
the
day
after
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
oh
yes,
yes.
he
was
arrested
by
the
police.
i
think
it
was
the
day
after
the
alleged
offense.
but
you
--
you
--
the
--
you
see
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
they
arrested
labat,
i
understand
on
--
on
this
crime.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
now
that
he
was
identified
later
by
the
victim
not
before
his
arrest
--
not
before
his
arrest.
i
believe
he
was
identified.
his
name
was
brought
in
by
another
witness,
but
not
by
the
prosecuting
witness
until
after
he
was
arrested.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
what's
that?
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no
sir.
i
had
--
no,
poret
was
not
brought
into
the
case
by
the
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
right.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
in
the
record
doesn't
show
it
because
that
is
where
i
found
my
motion
for
a
severance.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
the
confession
of
labat
implicated
poret.
and
that's
how
the
authorities
were
looking
for
poret.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
--
that's
something
i
couldn't
answer
sir.
it
was
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
the
record
doesn't
show
that
at
all
and
i
--
i
don't
have
knowledge
of
that
fact
at
all.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no
sir,
the
only
thing
that
i
got
into
the
case
was
when
he
was
brought
back
from
the
penitentiary
from
tennessee
and
that
wasn't
until
october.
well,
he
was
brought
back
on
october
the
3rd,
1952.
and
i
entered
the
case
on
october
the
25th,
1952.
so
in
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
something
i
don't
know
either
mr.
justice
--
the
court
--
i
know
that
the
--
it
was
not
--
he
was
there
nine
months.
he
--
he
had
nine
months
more
to
serve
in
his
term
in
--
in
tennessee
when
the
state
of
louisiana
issued
extradition
for
him
to
be
retuned.
in
other
words,
it
was
nine
months
before
his
time
in
the
penitentiary
was
up
in
tennessee.
they
issued
extradition.
and
the
authorities
of
tennessee,
the
governor
refused
extradition
and
said
that
louisiana
would
have
to
wait
until
he
finished
his
time
in
the
--
the
tennessee
penitentiary
before
they'd
let
come
back.
and
when
he
finished
that,
they
sent
him
back
or
that
was
louisiana
setup
and
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
extradition
or
no
extradition,
the
time
limit
had
expired.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
already
before
they
asked
extradition
in
this
case.
you
see,
his
time
limit
expired
in
--
in
march
the
8th,
1951.
and
the
state
didn't
know
that
he
was
in
the
penitentiary
in
tennessee
until
long
after
march
the
8th,
1951.
it
was
sometime
later
in
1951
that
they've
discovered
it.
it's
in
the
record
of
mr.
raul
(inaudible)
who
wrote
letters
to
the
authorities
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
he
also
testified
as
to
when
that
was
done.
that
is
in
the
record
in
the
poret
case.
he
was
the
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
not
because
he
didn't
know
about
it,
but
because
he
didn't
have
any
opportunity
to
file
a
motion
to
quash.
and
he
had
no
--
he
didn't
have
counsel
to
advice
him
to
file.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
no.
and
i
say
--
i
say
this
that
under
the
wilson
case,
if
he
was
in
the
state,
if
he
was
--
if
he
was
informed
to
this
indictment
against
him
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
well,
i
say
that
--
that
he
couldn't
have
possibly
had
filed
his
motion
to
quash
if
he
wasn't
there
and
he
didn't
know
anything
about
this.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well
sir,
this
is
the
first
--
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
--
this
particular
point
has
arisen.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
what's
that
sir?
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
i'd
say
that
as
--
as
soon
after
the
--
he
gets
back
as
the
court
of
the
district
of
tennessee
see
in
our
jurisdiction
that
if
the
court
doesn't
fix
the
cases,
the
district
attorney
fixes
the
cases
and
he
fixes
the
arraignments
for
trial.
the
court
doesn't
control
their
fixing
of
cases.
the
district
attorney
fixes
the
case
for
trial
and
he
fixes
the
arraignments
also
for
a
hearing.
and
as
soon
as
the
district
attorney
fixed
it
for
arraignment
is
when
we
came
in
and
asked
for
a
continuance
so
that
we
could
file
the
pleas
and
--
and
the
judge
also
who
was
the
(inaudible)
in
the
court
granted
me
until
november
the
7th.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
there
is
no
--
i
have
no
authority.
there's
no
statute
for
him
to
have
extra
time.
the
law
is
silent
on
it.
but
i
take
their
position
that
unless
the
defendant
is
informed
of
an
indictment,
there's
no
possible
way
for
him
to
know.
you
just
--
people
just
don't
go
down
in
the
court
house
when
the
grand
jury
returns
and
indictment
comes
with
returns
of
indictment
to
see
if
there's
any
indictment
return
against
them.
the
ordinary
procedure
is
that
when
the
indictment
is
returned,
a
warrant
of
arrest
issues
and
that
informs
that
warrant
of
arrest,
informs
the
defendant
as
to
the
crime
for
which
he
is
to
stand
trial.
and
if
that
is
done,
then
i
say
that
he,
under
the
wilson
case
he
would
have
until
the
third
judicial
day
after
the
grand
jury
time.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
or
mr.
schreiber's
man
--
mr.
schreiber's
man
had
not
been
--
been
arrested.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
would
say
yes.
in
other
words,
an
individual
to
be
charged
with
the
laxity
would
have
to
know
something
of
the
--
of
the
crime
that
he's
going
to
be
charge
with.
here,
you
have
a
man
that's
--
that's
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
entirely.
you
discover
him
out
of
the
jurisdiction.
when
you
do
discover
him
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
i'd
--
i
would
say
that
--
that
we
have
article
285
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
that
if
the
time
has
expired
for
him
to
file
his
motion
to
quash
that
he
he'd
--
he
would
have
up
until
the
arraignment
to
file
his
motion
to
quash.
you
see,
we
have
several
articles
pertaining
to
motions
to
quash
time
limits.
in
answer
to
your
question
sir,
if
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
--
indict
him
under
the
--
the
reading
of
the
of
the
statute,
we'll
say
that
three
judicial
days
of
the
time
which
would
be
the
first
three
days
of
the
grand
jury
time.
if
the
grand
jury
indicted
the
individual
on
the
fifth
to
sixth
day
of
the
time,
obviously,
if
the
crime
was
committed
after
that,
after
that
third
day
had
expired,
obviously,
we
wouldn't
have
an
opportunity
to
file
his
motion
to
quash.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
last
three
days.
now,
there
is
another
article
of
our
code
which
is
article
285
which
also
says
that,
if
his
case
goes
to
trial
sooner
than
that
time,
he
should
file
his
motion
to
quash
before
arraignment.
in
other
words,
they
don't
indict
a
person
in
louisiana
and
then
wait
until
the
grand
jury
goes
out
of
session
and
three
days
after
that
before
the
file.
it's
very
possible
that
the
man
could
be
indicted
on
march
the
1st,
1951.
the
grand
jury
goes
out
of
office
on
the
8th
and
his
trial
would
come
up
before
the
time
limit
expired.
it
could
be
set
for
the
6th
of
march
or
the
5th
of
--
before
the
8th
day
of
march
could
be
set.
now
then,
he
would
file
his
motion
to
quash
before
arraignment
or
at
arraignment.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
correct,
sir.
that's
to
keeping
him
from
after
going
to
trial
file
his
motion
to
quash
afterwards
of
doing
the
trial
of
the
case.
that's
what
article
285
is
designed
for.
but
i
say
that
in
the
--
in
poret
case,
that
he
was
denied
due
process
of
law
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
--
he
had
no
knowledge.
he
had
no
--
he
couldn't
have
filed
it
within
the
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
just
from
the
records.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no
sir,
i
don't
know.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no
sir,
i
don't
know
of
any.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no
sir,
i
don't
know
of
any
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
i
mean
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that
is
the
point.
if
he
would
--
if
he
is
denied
because
he's
not
in
jurisdiction,
the
right
to
file
a
motion
to
quash
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
that
he
--
he
wouldn't
know
about
it.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
correct.
that
is
exactly
what
we
--
what
we
contend
in
this
case,
sir.
and
i
say
this
that
to
--
to
deprive
him
of
that
right
would
be
the
same
to
defy
him
on
the
right
of
arraignment
or
the
right
if
he
had
filed
by
a
jury.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
self-defense,
it
could
be
done
just
the
same.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that
--
that's
exactly
my
position.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
you
can't
set
up
any
defense
of
self-defense.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
what's
that,
sir?
i
didn't
get
you.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
he
could.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
correct,
sir.
yes,
sir.
so
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
you
cite
he
would
be
cut-off
from
his
constitutional
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
right,
sir.
that's
correct.
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
that's
what
it
amounts
to
in
the
poret
case.
and
we
submit
and
as
far
as
clifton
poret
is
concerned
that
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
rights
n
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
even
challenge
the
grand
jury
panel
and
the
venire.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
thank
you,
your
honor?
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
i'll
--
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
was
--
i
was
going
to
answer
two
points
before
i
address
myself
to
that
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
if
the
court
pleases.
one
point
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
raised
earlier
about
the
question
of
why
this
man
wasn't
tried
for
so
long
and
i
think
mr.
justice
clark,
has
given
the
same
answer
which
i
would.
and
i
don't
mean
to
--
to
explain
the
delay
or
excuse
it.
we
were
not
in
the
office
at
the
time.
i
don't
really
know.
but
i
do
know
that
the
trial
was
continued
on
two
occasions
and
that
about
a
year
before
the
trial
was
held.
and
about
at
the
time
of
the
last
continuance
or
a
little
while
before
that
they
were
notified.
the
state
was
that
this
man
would
be
available,
the
codefendant
for
prosecution
in
louisiana,
within
a
reasonable
time
after
that
last
continuance.
and
apparently
the
decision
was
made
then
that
it
was
better
to
wait
a
few
more
months
than
to
try,
to
try
the
two
of
them
separately.
so
that
that's
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
and
it's
--
it's
a
problem
which
we
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
which
we
constantly
fight.
which
we're
aware
of
and
which
we
are
working
to
(inaudible)
we
--
we
are
working
very
hard
at.
there's
no
statute
that
i
know
of.
we
do
have
a
constitutional
provision
that
a
defendant
can
insist
upon
a
speedy
trial.
and
he
has
the
right
to
file
a
motion
to
go
trial
himself
because
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
good
teachers
of
criminal
law
teach
that
every
day
of
delay
is
beneficial
to
the
defendant.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
i
meant
good
district
attorney.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
he's
a
good
former
of
district
attorney,
excuse
me,
mr.
justice.
the
second
point
that
--
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
raised
and
i
--
and
i
can
well
agree
that
i
too
would
be
concerned
if
these
were
a
singling
out
of
a
particular
defendant,
that
the
state
had
decided,
well,
now
we're
going
--
we're
going
to
use
202
in
this
case
and
we
never
have
used
it
before,
but
we're
going
to
use
it.
i'd
like
state
to
the
court
that
in
the
18
months
during
which
we
have
prosecuted
in
the
new
orleans,
there
hasn't
been
a
single
instance
in
which
a
motion
to
quash
was
filed
after
the
delay
provided
in
article
202.
so
that
certainly,
for
the
last
18
months,
it's
safe
to
say
that
no
counsel
has
allowed
the
time
of
three
days
beyond
the
grand
jury
term
to
expire
without
filing
these
motions.
and
there
have
been
some
of
them
filed.
but
there
has
not
been
one
single
instance
where
they
have
been
filed
too
late.
and
i
think
that's
important
because
i
think
it
shows
that
in
the
great
many
cases,
these
things
are
filed
timely
and
that
the
reason
why
there's
not
more
jurisprudence
in
--
in
louisiana
supreme
court,
on
202,
is
that
there
are
only
few
cases
in
which
counsel
have
not
filed
these
things
timely.
now,
with
respect
to
defendant
poret
in
his
claim
that
this
article
202
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
my
point
was,
mr.
justice,
that
in
18
months
that
i
can
state
to
the
court
my
own
experience,
there
hasn't
been
a
single
instance
in
which
defense
counsel
has
allowed
the
time
provided
in
202
to
expire.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
so,
that
there
wasn't
a
single
opportunity
for
the
state
to
file
a
demurrer
based
on
article
202.
and
i
--
and
i
suggest
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
that
that
situation
may
very
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
would
say
that
there
are
certainly
three
that
i
know
of.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
i
mean
since
the
last
18
months
which
is
what
i
was
suggesting
here,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
these
are
much
earlier.
yes,
sir.
and
i
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
and
i
suggest
that
the
fact
that
there
are
only
a
few
file
too
late
in
the
last
18
months,
probably
accounts
for
the
lack
of
--
of
a
few
of
them
being
filed
prior
to
that.
counsel
filed
them
timely.
hence,
there's
no
reason
for
motion
to
demur,
for
a
demurrer
by
the
state.
and,
of
course,
all
counsel
don't
file
it
at
all.
so,
that
is
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
[laughs]
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
could
do
what
mr.
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
i
didn't
mean
to
attribute
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
wasn't
different.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
and
that
is
why
this
is
the
case
in
which
this
is
raised.
and
that's
my
answer
to
the
suggestion
that
we're
singling
out
this
man
here
for
following
a
demurrer.
that
the
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
don't
think
that
those
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
and
we
don't
claim
any.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
but
my
--
my
point
is
that
lack
of
these
things
in
the
last
18
months
means
that
there
probably
weren't
many
before
it.
hence,
no
demurrers.
hence
no
202.
now,
with
respect
to
poret's
claim
that
this
--
this
is
a
non-constitutional
application
of
article
202
because
he
was
not
in
the
jurisdiction
because
he
wasn't
notified
because
he
wasn't
arrested.
i
suggest
to
the
court,
first
of
all,
that
the
record
at
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
that
poret
was
a
fugitive.
there
are
--
there's
a
--
there's
ample
evidence
in
the
record
that
not
only
the
--
the
criminal
sheriff
who
was
our
counterpart
(inaudible),
not
only
that
office,
but
the
police
department
made
constant
and
persistent
efforts
to
locate
this
man.
there's
a
return
of
the
deputy
sheriff
indicating
that
he
had
been
told.
i
think
that's
in
the
record
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
that
he
had
been
told
by
this
man's
relatives
that
he
had
left
the
day
after
this
crime
was
committed.
there
is
additional
evidence
which
is
not
in
this
record
in
the
lower
court
upon
which
the
state
court
made
its
finding
both
the
district
court
and
the
supreme
court
that
poret
was
a
fugitive.
now,
this
wasn't
made
without
any
opportunity
to
poret
to
prove
to
the
court
that
he
was
not
in
fact
a
fugitive,
but
that
it
was
in
good
faith
in
leaving
the
jurisdiction.
there
was
a
hearing
held
at
which
the
defense
had
a
right
to
present
any
evidence
that
it
wanted
to
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
was
a
fugitive.
and
unless
my
recollection
is
wrong,
poret
presented
no
evidence,
not
his
own
anyone
else's.
and
all
of
the
evidence
presented
by
the
state
indicated
that
he
was
in
fact
a
fugitive
from
justice.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
was
he
in
tennessee
at
the
time?
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
this
was
in
a
hearing
in
the
criminal
district
court
in
orleans
parish
on
the
--
on
the
demurrer
of
the
state
because
he
raised
the
point,
you
can't
apply
this
to
me.
i
didn't
know
anything
about
him.
the
court
went
into
the
question
of
whether
he
was
not
a
fugitive.
and
made
a
finding
that
he
was
based
upon
ample
record.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
the
proof
is
that
--
that
the
sheriff's
office
made
several
attempts
almost
immediately
after
this
crime
to
locate
him
at
a
place
where
he
was
known
to
have
lived.
he
wasn't
there.
the
return
of
the
sheriff
is
with
an
advice
that
he
left.
he
left
yesterday.
this
was
a
day
after
the
crime.
and
the
police
department
and
the
district
attorney's
office
testified,
we
tried
to
find
this
man.
we
did
everything
we
could.
he
was
nowhere
to
be
located.
now,
this
is
a
native
of
new
orleans.
he
turns
up
at
the
tennessee
penitentiary.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
if
the
state
absent
to
defend
in
his
own
testimony
could
never
do
any
better
than
that
than
to
show
that
here's
a
man
who's
living
in
this
jurisdiction
until
the
date
that
he
commits
a
crime.
he
leaves
the
next
day.
we
tried
to
find
him
consistently.
we
can't
locate
him
and
he
turns
up
in
the
penitentiary
in
tennessee.
and
i
--
and
i
suggest
that
that's
ample
evidence
that
he
was
in
fact
a
fugitive,
especially,
when
you
consider
that
he
introduced
nothing
at
all
to
rebut
that.
makes
no
serious
argument
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
that
he
wasn't
a
fugitive.
none
in
his
brief
here.
no
evidence
of
it.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
found
and
gave
him
a
hearing
on
the
question.
we're
not
going
to
file
this
202.
apparently,
the
district
court
wouldn't
have
applied
if
he
had
--
had
he
been
in
good
faith
in
being
absent.
we're
not
going
to
apply
it
said
the
district
court
until
we
hear
evidence
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you're
a
fugitive.
so
that
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
don't
know
that
i'm
prepared
to
concede
that,
i
don't
know
that
that
i'm
given
a
lot
of
thought
to
it
mr.
justice
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
warren
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
because
i
think
that
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
frankly
don't
know.
i
frankly
don't
know
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
i
--
i
think
that
record
here
as
it's
presented
to
this
court
positively
shows
that
he's
a
fugitive.
and
i
--
i
frankly
don't
know
what
my
position
would
be.
i
don't
know
what
this
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
had
said
that
court
--
i
don't
know,
of
course,
what
the
court
would
have
done,
but
i
said
that
the
court
apparently
wanted
to
know
whether
he
was
a
fugitive
because
it
took
evidence
on
the
point
at
district
court.
and,
of
course,
the
supreme
court
found
him
to
be
a
fugitive.
supreme
court
of
louisiana
did
and
bases
its
conclusion
that
202
runs
even
in
the
absence
of
an
arrest
because
he
was
a
fugitive.
that
i
can
state
to
the
court
definitely.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana's
finding
here
that
202
did
run
against
it.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that
--
yes,
i
do.
i
do.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
and
i
say
that
202
as
--
as
interpreted
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
says
exactly
that.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
it
does.
and
i
--
and
i
suggest
that
the
basis
for
the
validity
of
that
position
is
that
louisiana
has
a
valid
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
these
things
are
filed
early
in
the
proceedings,
not
necessarily,
in
relation
to
the
proceedings
against
this
defendant
but
with
respect
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
wilson,
the
concern
of
louisiana
is
that
we
are
going
to
have
to
justify
this
grand
jury.
and
therefore
we
have
a
right
to
insist
that
this
plea
may
be
made
early.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
think
the
difference,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
louisiana
has
no
valid
interest
in
denying
a
man
the
right
to
plead
self
defense
because
he's
been
a
fugitive,
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
or
because
the
mere
passage
of
time.
whereas
we
have
a
valid
interest
in
depriving
him
of
that
right
to
attack
our
grand
jury
which
we
have
to
justify.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
i
certainly
do.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
do.
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
another
distinction
is
that
he
has
no
--
he
has
no
constitutional
right
to
a
grand
jury
as
such
as
he
would
to
the
plea
of
self
defense
or
whatever
other
plea
that
he
might
have
in
the
trial
of
the
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
don't
think
my
answer
would
be
the
same.
no,
sir
because
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
because
we
have
no
valid
interest
in
--
in
making
him
raise
a
prejudice
of
a
judge
at
a
--
at
an
--
at
a
date
when
a
judge
is
still
there
to
testify
that
he's
not
biased.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
and
this
is
an
indictment
surely.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
but
over
and
above
that,
i
think
that
if
you
examine
the
--
the
rationale
of
the
wilson
decision
that
where
the
court
goes
into,
why
we
have
202.
and
remember,
mr.
justice
black,
the
202
does
not
apply
only
to
grand
jury.
the
attacks
on
grand
jury
is
based
on
federal
grounds.
our
grand
jurors
have
to
read
and
write.
they
have
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
state.
there
are
many,
many
other
qualifications.
and
if
you
can
do
this
thing
two
years
later,
the
state
is
simply
not
going
to
be
able
to
justify
the
panel
of
its
grand
jury.
and
if
the
defendant
as
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
pointed
out
can
extend
this
time
simply
by
fleeing,
if
he's
a
--
if
he's
a
good
fleer,
he
can
--
he
can
extend
it
to
the
point
that
we
could
never
justify
the
grand
jury.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
think
this
that
it
indicates
the
length
to
which
this
court
will
go
to
protect
the
state's
right
to
regulate
its
criminal
procedure
given
a
valid
interest
which
i
say
we
have
here
and
which
is
exhibited
by
the
wilson
case.
and
which
i
think
has
made
a
point
about
wilson.
now,
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
would
answer
that
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
believe
that,
in
first
place,
in
new
orleans
we
have
ten
warrants
of
arrest
resulting
from
grand
jury
indictments
where
they
have
not
arrested
defendants.
and
i
would
answer
you
further
that
in
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
whatever
cases
we
do
have,
those
people
are
fugitives.
and
it's
been
well
established
that
they
are.
the
police
departments
are
being
debauched
everyday
for
it.
and
i
say
that
if
we
prove
they're
fugitives,
very
definitely
their
time
has
ran.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
let
me
not
mislead,
your
honor.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
let
me
not.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
let
me
not
mislead,
your
honor.
i'm
talking
about
warrants
resulting
from
grand
jury
indictments.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
now,
we
filed
--
we
filed
those
of
information
in
all
felonies
other
than
grand
--
other
than
capital
cases.
and
i
say
resulting
from
grand
jury
indictments
where
202
would
be
applicable
i
should
think
that
there
are
less
than
10.
and
maybe
less
than
half
a
dozen
capital
cases
where
defendants
are
not
arrested.
and
i
say
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
state
could
and
would
prove
that
those
people
are
fugitives.
and
they
usually
turn
up
in
penitentiaries
in
other
states.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
a
--
a
rough
guess
would
--
i
should
think
this
would
be
right
within
10%.
no,
in
a
year,
75.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
capital
indictments.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
that
was
total
indictments
i
would
--
it's
between
50
and
75,
i
would
say.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
not
that
many.
mr.
hubert
thinks
30.
i've
never
--
i've
never
made
a
count.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
--
i
frankly
think
it's
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
it's
more
than
that.
but
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
certainly
in
capital
cases,
we
have
very
few
on
or
books
that
have
not
been
arrested,
very
few.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
what
i
--
i
would
say
that
our
grand
jury
doesn't
indict
in
other
than
capital
cases,
(inaudible)
indictments
in
a
year
other
than
capital
cases.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes
and
no.
the
police
--
the
police
serves
--
doesn't
actually,
the
police
found
and
served
the
process
but
they'll
pick
him
up
and
bring
him
to
the
sheriff
and
he
serves.
but
the
sheriff
serves
him
also.
i
mean
the
police
department
is
out
looking
for
people
if
that's
--
if
that's
what
your
honor
driving
definitely.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
think
technically,
that's
correct
in
--
in
louisiana.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes.
that's
correct
in
louisiana,
technically,
but
i
think
it's
practical
now
that
the
police
department
has
most
of
it.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
would
say
no
that
it
would
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
be
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
prove
that
he's
--
he
was
a
fugitive.
i
might
add
one
other
thing.
and
i'm
just,
of
course.guessing
more
or
less
what
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
would
do.
but
i
--
i
guess
it
because
of
what
mr.
hubert
has
characterized
this
meticulous
concern
for
federal
rights
and
they
have
evidenced
it.
that
in
the
michel
case,
the
court
indicated
that
had
it
found
no
appointment
of
counsel
on
march
2nd
that
they
--that
they
may
have
reached
a
different
result
because
they
recognized,
of
course,
the
federal
right
to
counsel.
this
court
has
held
that
a
man's
entitled
to
counsel.
and
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
goes
into
the
question
of
whether
he
is
a
fugitive
as
of
indicating
to
me
that
they
may
reach
a
different
result
if
the
proof
is
different
on
the
question
of
fugitive
here.
if
he's
not
a
fugitive,
the
court
might
reach
a
different
result.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no.
but
i
think
that
--
that
i
can
--
i
can
bridge
that
gap
for
this.
that
202
makes
no
exceptions.
202
says
that
if
you
don't
file
it
within
three
days
that
is
the
end.
and
the
state
is
not
here
claiming
that
we
are
reading
into
202
something
which
makes
it
apply
to
a
fugitive.
202
on
its
face
applies
to
everyone.
this
defendant
is
here
asking
and
asked
the
louisiana
supreme
court
to
read
into
202
an
exception
with
respect
to
fugitives
which
louisiana
supreme
court
refused
to
do
and
i
suggest
probably
so.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
would
answer
that
the
same
way
that
i
think
the
louisiana
supreme
court
indicated
by
its
very
finding
that
that
this
man
was
a
fugitive.
that
if
a
situation
is
presented,
where
a
man
has
not
himself
contributed
to
this
thing,
that
they
would
reach
a
different
result.
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
would
answer
that
the
same
way.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
if
--
if
his
locking
prevented
an
arrest,
i
think
that's
correct.
and
i
suggest
that
it
is.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
think
that
it
ought
to
be.
i'd
like
to
--
to
pass
from
this
point
of
whether
he's
a
fugitive
which
i
think
is
amply
--
amply
justified
to
the
second
point
which
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
passed
upon.
on
this
particular
question,
i'd
like
to
read
from
page
21
of
our
brief.
it's
just
short
and
it
will
take
a
minute.
in
answer
to
poret's
objection,
you
can't
apply
202
to
me
because
he
says,
“i
don't
know
anything
about
this
indictment
and
therefore,
it's
unconstitutional
to
file
against
me.”
“it's
not
true,”
says
the
supreme
court."
and
i
think
the
reasoning
is
--
is
very
fine.
that
the
defendant
poret
was
denied
an
opportunity
to
file
his
motion
timely.
he
was
indicted
on
december
11,
1950,
had
until
march
8,
1951,
a
period
of
almost
three
months
in
which
to
file
his
motion
to
quash.
now,
why
--
why
didn't
he
file
it?
his
own
actions
to
avoid
for
prosecution
caused
him
not
to
avail
himself
for
the
right
to
challenge
the
jury.
this
is
a
choice
which
he
exercised,
says
the
supreme
court.
during
this
time,
he
could
have
filed
a
motion.
he
was
a
fugitive
by
his
own
choice
and
will.
if
we
concede
that
his
flight
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
file
a
motion
timely,
he
himself
knew
about
the
situation
which
made
it
impossible.
to
our
minds,
it
would
be
improper
to
hold
that
the
prescriptive
period
provided
on
the
statute
is
applicable
to
the
accused
held
under
arrest
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
but
is
not
applicable
to
the
accused,
who
of
his
own
will,
the
court
has
absconded
to
avoid
prosecution.
such
a
holding
would
be
tantamount
to
rewarding
the
absconding
person
for
his
right.
moreover,
the
article
provides
for
prescriptive
theory
which
runs
against
the
accused
and
he
can't
by
any
acts
of
his
own
extend
the
time
provided
for
in
this
statute.
now,
i
suggest
that
actually
what
this
gets
itself
down
to
is
this.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
found
that
there
is
no
exception
to
202
with
respect
to
fugitives.
and
on
a
well
recognized
principle
which
we've
already
discussed,
this
court,
i
think
will
accept
that
finding,
unless
--
unless
it's
unreasonable
and
unless
it's
designed
to
--
to
hurt
--
to
--
to
deprive
somebody
of
a
federal
right.
and
unless
it's
unreasonable.
then
it
violates
the
due
process.
the
issue
gets
down
to
this.
is
it
unreasonable?
is
it
unconstitutional
for
the
state
of
louisiana
to
refuse
to
reward
someone
who
is
a
fugitive
because
he
was
successful
in
his
flight?
it
gets
down
to
that
narrow
point.
is
it
unreasonable
or
is
it
therefore
unconstitutional
for
the
state
of
louisiana
to
provide
that
a
fugitive
shall
not
get
any
special
privileges
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he's
a
fugitive.
congress
does
virtually
the
same
thing.
and
we
cite
the
--
the
statute
of
limitations
and
everyone
that
i
could
find
says
the
same
thing.
we
treat
certain
people,
if
you're
not
prosecuted
within
the
certain
time,
you
can't
prosecute.
what
about
a
fugitive?
congress
says
that
we're
going
to
reward
him
because
he
pled
no.
that
statute
of
limitations
will
not
apply
to
a
fugitive.
i
can
find
--
and
i
could
find
none
that
does
and
i
submit
that
the
logic
behind
that
statute
of
limitation,
certainly
it's
a
different
thing.
but
the
logic
behind
the
refusal
to
reward
a
fugitive
is
as
applicable
here.
the
supreme
court
says
we
are
faced
with
this
problem.
will
we
reward
a
fugitive?
and
says,
"no,
we
will
not."
and
this
court
must
be
told
that
it's
refusal
to
reward
a
fugitive
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
reward
him
because
he
gets
--
if
--
if
your
honor,
if
i
can
state
this
--
the
rationale
of
202
again
in
the
wilson
case.
the
state's
in
a
better
position
to
justify
the
composition
of
its
grand
jury.
it
has
a
judge
there
who'll
may
be
dead
later
on.
it
has
the
jurors
there,
who
may
have
left
the
jurisdiction.
there
are
many,
many
reasons
why,
at
an
early
stage,
the
state
can
better
justify
the
composition
of
a
grand
jury.
now,
if
a
defendant
can
flee
and
--
and
thereby
extend
the
period
provided
in
202,
he
gets
the
real
reward.
because
the
state
may
not
have
available
information
and
it's
likely
that
it
won't,
which
it
would
have
had
available,
had
he
not
fled
and
had
the
theory
provided
202
run
against
them.
that's
what
i
say.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
--
i
suggest
that
202
doesn't.
202
deprives
him
of
that
because
he
doesn't
file
it
within
the
three
days.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
of
course.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i'm
--
i'm
reminded
that
every
prescriptive
statute
deprives
a
defendant.
every
statute
of
limitations
deprives
a
defendant
of
a
right
which
he
would
have
if
he
were
not
a
fugitive
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he's
a
fugitive.
congress
provides
that.
if
you're
not
prosecuted
with
a
certain
term,
you
can't
be.
this
man's
a
fugitive.
you
can't
deprive
him
because
of
a
fugitive
have
a
real
right.
the
defense,
statute
of
limitations,
no
defense.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
it's
a
certainly
a
deprivation
of
a
defense
which
he
otherwise
would
have
had
he
not
fled.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
and
that's
a
defense
which
he
certainly
would
have
--
had
he
not
fled.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
i
can't
--
i
can't
call
the
court's
attention
to
any
such
statute.
i
know
of
none.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir,
no
defense,
whatsoever.
the
state
of
louisiana
justice
black
as
i
understand
the
law
could
provide
that
anytime
there's
a
successful
attack
upon
the
grand
jury
that
the
district
attorney's
affidavit
charged
in
the
crime
shall
serve
as
sufficient
warrant
for
his
prosecution.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
a
--
a
petit
jury,
yes,
sir.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
of
course,
i'm
--
i'd
--
i'd
rather
not.
to
beg
with,
your
honor,
the
question.
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
--
to
--
to
--
skip
about
but
i'd
rather
not
debate
the
question
which
this
court
has
precluded.
and
that
is
that
defense
stage
cannot
discriminate
in
selecting
like
the
grand
juries.
i
have
to
accept
that.
i'm
willing
to
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
except
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
i'll
state
again
that
i
--
i
can
't
call
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
cannot
do
that
because
i
know
it's
not.
but
i'll
--
i'll
say
again
that
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
don't
retreat
from
it.
i've
--
i've
tried
not
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
i
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
certainly,
it's
--
it's
a
better
defense
than
a
grand
jury
indictment
being
invalid.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
mean
to
retreat
from
it
and
i
suggest
that
it's
a
much
better
defense
than
this.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
pardon
me?
i
only
step
back
one
step
at
a
time.
now,
i'd
like
to
get
for
just
one
moment
to
the
question
of
--
of
this
petition
of
labat
and
his
contention
that
he
wasn't
represented
by
effective
counsel.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
something
you
already
have
noticed.
that
mr.
mahoney
was
supported
about
two
months
before
the
grand
jury
time
i
think.
he
did
nothing
conceded
--
concededly
until
about
a
year
and
two
months
later
when
he
got
out
of
the
case.
but
he
was
in
the
case
for
over
two
months
while
its
prescriptive
period
in
202,
the
statute
of
limitations
was
running.
we
call
the
court's
attention
in
brief
to
several
cases
from
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
where
the
courts
have
held
and
i
suggest
properly.
number
one,
first
of
all,
that
there's
a
presumption
that
counsel
was
confident.
man
is
licensed
to
practice
law,
we
assume
in
the
absence
of
the
showing
to
the
contrary
that
he
is
competent.
secondly,
that
his
incompetence
must
be
such
as
to
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court
before
the
court
would
set
aside
proceedings
on
the
ground
of
ineffective
counsel.
he
must
make,
says
--
says
the
circuit
court
a
sham
and
a
mockery
of
the
proceedings.
now,
with
this
background,
what
have
we
here
to
indicate
whether
or
not
mr.
mahoney
was
effective,
whether
he
was
a
competent
counsel?
the
only
thing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
is
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana's
language
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
which
the
supreme
court
has
never
said
about
me
or
about
a
lot
of
lawyers
whom
i
know.
and
which
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
said,
mind
you,
not
in
just
complimenting
mr.
mahoney
that
he's
a
nice
fellow
or
was,
but
because
there
was
an
attack
made
upon
him
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
that
he
was
not
competent
and
ineffective
and
what
does
the
court
say?
able,
learned,
distinguished
counsel,
there's
the
court
which
licenses
him
and
regulates
him
in
his
law
practice.
would
you
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i'm
going
to
get
to
that.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well
i've
already
stated
that
the
record
shows
that
he
did
nothing
for
a
year
and
two
months.
and
i
was
about
to
demonstrate
i
hope
that
if
--
that
that
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
that
mr.
mahoney
could
do
for
this
man,
the
best
thing
in
the
world.
and
in
retrospect,
if
i
were
representing
him,
i'd
have
done
exactly
the
same
thing.
and
why
was
it?
because
what
could
mr.
mahoney
have
done
inside
of
this
period
of
a
year
and
two
months.
come
into
court
and
say,
i
realized
i've
got
an
electric
chair
case,
it's
a
very
tough
case
on
the
facts
and
i
realize
that
the
state
witnesses
might
die
or
leave
the
jurisdiction
or
get
caught
and
that
the
facts
may
not
be
able
to
be
proved
in
a
year,
but
i
want
you
to
try
my
man
tomorrow.
that's
what
he
could
have
done.
he
could
have
said,
"i
want
you
to
put
this
man
in
trial,
right
now."
now,
aside
from
that,
the
only
other
thing
he
could
have
done
was
file
this
motion
to
quash.
and
i'd
like
to
examine
what
the
result
of
that
would
be.
assuming
that
the
motion
to
quash
was
time
--
was
timely
filed
and
then
it
was
valid.
it
would
result
in
a
finding
by
the
district
court,
and
counsel
was
called
in
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
at
least
one
our
judges
has
so
found
that
the
grand
jury
was
improperly
(inaudible).
so
then
what
happens?
i
suggest
that
within
a
period
of
a
very
short
time,
this
man
would
be
indicted
again
by
a
valid
grand
jury.
but,
instead
of
that
what
does
mr.
mahoney
do?
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
i
--
he
made
very
well
and
all
the
counsel
in
this
case
made
very
well.
i
don't
say
that
it
was
true
but
it
could
be
may
very
well
have
reached
the
positive
determination.
i
would
rather
not
file
this
thing
timely
and
why?
because
if
i
don't'
file
it
timely,
then
i
can
attack
202
as
being
unconstitutional
after
my
trial.
then
i'll
get
a
trial
by
petit
jury
and
i'll
take
my
chances.
i
might
get
a
good
verdict
from
that
jury.
if
i
don't,
i
haven't
lost
anything
because
then
i'm
not
effective
counsel.
i
haven't
done
anything,
202
doesn't
hurt
him
and
as
a
result
he
gets
another
trial
and
another
chance
at
a
good
jury
verdict.
so
that
i
suggest
that
it
--
it's
--its
as
--
as
indicative
of
strategy
and
instigation
to
not
to
file
this
motion,
as
it
is
to
file
it.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
i
don't
know
if
he
was
representing
this
defendant
and
wanting
to
give
him
every
possible
opportunity
that
he
could.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
if
he
was
convinced
that
202
was
unconstitutional,
i
don't
know
that
--
that
there's
anything
dishonorable
about
raising
the
point.
if
he's
convinced
that
it
is,
and
if
he's
convinced
that
there's
going
to
be
a
finding
that
he
is
not
effective
counsel,
i
don't
know.
but
i
suggest
it
certainly,
you
get
down
to
this
on
the
point
of
effective
counsel.
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
file
but
because
mr.
mahoney
didn't
file
this
motion,
that's
it
--
that's
the
only
thing
he
could
have
done,
except
to
bring
his
man
to
the
trial
and
how
they
offer
verdict.
that's
the
only
thing
he
could
have
done.
and
counsel
asked
this
court
to
be
--
to
go
pretty
far
to
hold
that
a
man
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
described
he's
able,
competent,
and
experienced,
learned,
that's
he's
ineffective
counsel
such
as
to
shock
the
conscience
of
the
court
because
he
doesn't
file
a
motion
to
quash.
an
indictment
based
upon
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
is
that
so
--
i
said
so
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
let
me
state
that
mr.
mahoney
may
have
known
that
the
grand
jury
was
in
fact
properly
constituted.
i
don't
know.
he
may
have
known
that
it
was.
we
can't
assume
that
it
was
not
and
that
he
just
sat
by
and
so
i'm
going
to
let
this
man
lose
his
rights.
he
cannot
assume
that.
so
that,
the
mere
lack
of
filing
of
this
motion
is
suggested
as
sufficient
reason
for
finding
by
this
court
that
mr.
mahoney
is
not
effective
counsel.
and
if
that's
true,
when
does
202
ever
have
any
application?
every
time
somebody
doesn't
file
it,
the
defendant
didn't
have
effective
counsel,
so
the
court
releasing
of
the
limitation
provided
in
202
and
202
never
applies
to
anybody
because
we
just
don't
ever
file
them
until
the
three
days
are
up
and
then
he
had
no
effective
counsel
because
it
wasn't
raised.
and
therefore,
the
limitation
doesn't
apply
against
him.
he
has
not
been
represented
by
effective
counsel.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
sir.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
know
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
was
in
bed
but
he
certainly
was
and
i
do
know
this.
as
far
as
i
remember,
mr.
mahoney
and
of
course
i've
been
told
by
the
people
he
wasn't
in
bed
when
this
two
months
was
running.
and
certainly
he
wasn't
in
bed
the
day
the
court
consulted
him
and
said,
"will
you
take
the
support
with
mr.
mahoney?"
mr.
mahoney
was
--
was
one
of
the
best
known
criminal
lawyers
in
new
orleans.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
[laughs]
well,
now.
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
judge.
i
didn't
want
to
go
out
of
the
record
on
the
point
but
the
point
is
that
he
was
in
fact
distinguished.
he
probably
handled
more
appointments
than
any
other
lawyer
in
new
orleans
ever
did.
and
--
and
we
call
the
court's
attention
in
--
in
a
supplement
to
our
brief.
and
the
defendant
also
agreed.
this
man
was
honored
by
the
--
by
the
community,
by
the
criminal
court
bar
association
to
which
probably
all
of
these
people
belong
as
a
--
as
a
fine
man
for
his
contribution
to
criminal
justice.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
appointments
to
represent
defendants
in
--
in
cases
at
the
request
of
the
court.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
he
--
he
had
and
he
had
done
as
much
of
that
kind
of
services
and
i
think
anybody
in
the
history
in
the
world.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
not
only
requires
appointment,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes
and
requires
a
man
with
at
least
five
years
experience
which
i
suggest
is
further
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no
sir,
we
have
been
in
the
last
period
since
at
least
in
our
knowledge
we
pay
expenses
and
we
charge
like
the
expenses
on
that.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
think
it's
in
the
1928
code
of
criminal
procedure.
i
don't
know
how
far
back.
i
think
it's
not
in
our
constitution
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
oh
yes.
i
think
it
goes
back
to
all
(inaudible)
we're
early
on
it,
our
first
constitution.
i'm
not
certain
enough
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
think
very
little,
very
little.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
i
avoided.
there's
going
to
be
a
reply
i
made
to
preserve
(inaudible)
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
i
would
try
to
be
very
brief,
your
honors.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
perhaps
mr.
mahoney
in
doing
nothing
for
this
client
was
engaging
in
some
significant
strategy.
i
wish
to
call,
your
honors
attention
to
the
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney
on
page
25
of
this
brief.
he
says,
"mahoney
may
have
determined
that
such
an
attack
would
be
in
vain
since
he
may
have
known
as
a
fact
that
there
had
been
no
systematic
exclusion.
i
submit
that
the
district
attorney
in
--
in
making
that
statement
in
his
brief
is
contrary
to
judicially
admitted
facts
of
the
newspaper
or
articles
which
reported
our
brief
showing
that
it's
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
at
least
there's
a
prima
facie
case
in
louisiana
for
showing
that
there's
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
grand
jury.
it's
a
common
knowledge.
i
have
newspapers
all
over
the
place
but
i
have
quoted
one
of
them
in
my
brief
which
i
think
succinctly
--
states
the
point.
now,
i
submit
that
if
mr.
mahoney
tried
to
do
the
other
thing
and
that
is
say
well,
i'll
let
my
client's
rights
pass.
i've
got
a
capital
case.
this
man
may
be
electrocuted
but
i'm
going
to
let
this
delays
run
and
then
i'll
come
and
try
to
--
to
confuse
the
court
and
maybe
get
a
writ
out
of
the
supreme
court.
i
submit
that
that
statement
of
its
very
nature
would
indicate
that
that
mr.
mahoney,
if
he
did
that,
well
then
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing
and
certainly
he
wasn't
an
effective
counsel.
he
was
--
was
ineffective.
if
--
if
he
tried
to
let
a
--
a
substantial
delay
when
he
had
a
prima
facie
case,
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
a
matter
of
--
i
would
say
that
the
courts
--
the
criminal
district
court
of
the
parish
of
orleans
takes
judicial
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
at
least
there's
a
prima
case
of
discrimination
on
juries
and
the
lawyer
lets
it
pass
in
the
hope
of
getting
some
type
of
writ
from
this
court
of
something.
i
--
i
just
would.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
he
would
have
gotten
first
of
all
a
quashing
of
the
indictment.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
possibly
so.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
possibly
his
client
might
not
have
been
reindicted
with
a
constitutional
jury.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes,
but
at
least
i
would
say
that
if
i
have
a
prima
facie
case
of
an
unconstitutional
grand
jury
indicting
my
client,
and
i
have
a
means
of
procedure
whereby
i
can
get
a
constitutional
grand
jury
then
i
certainly
as
astute
counsel
should
file
the
motion
and
have
my
client
indicted
by
a
constitutional
grand
jury.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
he
might
have
and
he
might
have
not
your
honor,
but
the
fact
is
i
think
that
as
was
stated
by
someone,
this
man
is
entitled
to
a
constitutional
grand
jury
and
a
constitutional
trial
and
he
didn't
get
it
under
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
i
am
not
prepared
to
state
that
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
customarily,
it
set
all
for
about
a
--a
week
to
10
days
--
15
days
at
which
time
the
district
attorney
comes
in
and
files
an
answer
to
the
motion
to
quash.
as
i
say
customarily,
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
then
that
--
then
that
is
tried.
customarily,
when
the
motion
is
timely
made,
since
your
honor
asked
to
this.
it's
not
in
the
record.
customarily,
if
the
motion
is
timely
made,
and
it's
not
a
particularly
(inaudible)
case,
the
district
attorney
in
the
past
is
often
pleased.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
nothing
in
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
no,
no,
nothing
to
do
with
when
the
case
was
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
well,
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
but
my
point
is
that
you
--
if
you
filed
it
and
the
lower
court
quashed
it
or
you
went
to
the
supreme
court
when
you
finally
came
back
and
needed
to
be
reindicted
again,
what
i
submit
that
the
second
time
that
he
would
be
reindicted,
he
would
be
reindicted
by
a
constitutional
grand
jury.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
a
brand
new
case
just
as
this
case
will
be
if
your
honors
remanded
and
we're
show
that
this
grand
jury
was
unconstitutional
the
it
will
be
up
for
further
proceedings.
but
i
submit
further
if
your
honor
please
that
in
the
events
that
this
court
should
see
fit
to
remand
the
case
of
the
codefendant,
poret,
who
was
indicted
on
the
same
indictment
as
labat,
the
same
physical
piece
of
paper
by
the
same
grand
jury
for
reasons
not
as
cited
by
labat
but
which
were
recited
by
poret.
in
other
way,
the
substantial
--
although
the
codefendants
have
tried
at
the
same
time,
there
are
substantial
factual
differences
in
the
question
of
article
202
that
if
your
honors
should
see
fit
to
remand
poret's
case,
then
under
the
law,
your
honors
should
also
remand
this
case.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
under
the
louisiana
jurisprudence
which
says
as
follows,
when
a
motion
to
quash
--
if
it
--
while
a
motion
to
quash
is
limited,
while
a
motion
to
quash
a
particular
indictment
was
limited
in
effect
to
the
defendant
invoking
it,
a
motion
to
set
aside
as
a
venire
if
sustained
had
the
effect
of
declaring
the
venire
bad
and
illegally
drawn
and
the
jurors
composing
it,
no
longer
jurors
and
no
indictment
or
conviction
by
them
would
stand.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
that's
state
versus
revels
in
31
louisiana
(inaudible)
which
is
cited
on
page
24
of
my
brief.
in
other
--
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
now,
well
that's
the
--
that's
the
point
i
wish
to
get
over.
and
with
that
your
honors,
i
wish
to
submit
remand.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
yes
i
would.
mr.
adrian
g.
duplantier
the
louisiana
statutes
which
was
mentioned
to
the
effect
that
a
person
must
have
practiced
law
for
five
years
before
he
can
represent
the
person
in
the
criminal
case.
i
don't
believe
mr.
fust
has
been
practicing
five
years
in
1952.
it
couldn't
have
been
a
chief
counsel.
mr.
schreiber
must
have
known
that.
my
recollection
is
that
mr.
fust
graduated
in
1950.
