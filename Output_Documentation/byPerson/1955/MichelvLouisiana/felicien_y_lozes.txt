mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
defendant,
edgar
labat,
whose
codefendant
with
clifton
poret
in
number
36.
at
the
outset,
let
me
say
that
i
feel
that
i
am
somewhat
in
agreement
with
mr.
hubert
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
others
with
the
general
approach
towards
article
202.
however,
it
is
my
contention
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
article
202
by
this
court,
so
as
to
ascertain
if
due
process
has
been
afforded,
the
petitioner
depends
upon
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
case.
and
this
court
might
consistently
say
in
one
case
of
article
202,
deprived
him
of
due
process
because
of
the
manner,
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
administration
of
article
202,
either
through
a
design
of
the
state
officials
or
possibly
through
negligence
or
over
side
of
the
state
officials.
i
think
the
important
point
and
the
real
point
before
this
court
is
whether
in
fact,
in
fact,
based
on
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
case,
the
administration
of
article
202
by
the
court,
the
lower
court,
by
the
state
officials,
the
district
attorney
and
by
the
supreme
court,
and
by
everyone
who
had
anything
to
do
with
the
case,
whether
in
fact
the
defendant
and
petitioner
here
was
denied
the
right
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
what
gives
this
court
its
strength,
its
power
and
its
validity,
the
right
to
inquire
and
the
right
to
say,
“we
have
seen
discrimination.
we
have
seen
a
refusal
of
due
process
and
we
will
strike
it
down.”
now,
gentlemen
of
the
court,
the
facts
of
the
case
of
edgar
labat
insofar
as
they
applied
to
the
motion
to
article
202
are
relatively
simple
and
on
page
1
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
and
two,
they're
clearly
indicated.
the
record
shows
that
edgar
labat
was
arraigned
on
january
3rd,
1951.
the
record
shows
that
the
above
name,
defendant
in
person,
was
placed
at
the
bar
of
the
court
to
be
arraigned
on
charges
filed
against
him.
and
after
hearing
the
indictment,
together
with
the
endorsements
thereon
read,
the
defendant,
unattended
by
counsel,
at
arraignment,
the
defendant
unattended
by
counsel
pleaded
not
guilty
thereto,
circumstance
number
one.
the
court
informed
the
defendant
of
the
seriousness
of
the
charges
and
inquired
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
employ
counsel
by
his
trial.
the
defendant
notified
the
court
that
his
family
was
in
the
process
of
hiring
counsel
for
his
defense.
the
court
notified
the
defendant
to
let
the
court
know
on
friday,
january
5th,
if
he
had
retained
counsel.
that's
two
days
to
give
to
a
full
ignorant
negro
and
the
record
shows
that
the
hospital
orderly
right
to
employ
counsel
--
time
to
employ
counsel
in
a
capital
case.
and
i
might
say,
parenthetically,
a
case
in
which
it
is
difficult
sometimes
to
get
counsel.
so,
he
then
see
january
5th,
two
days
later,
edgar
labat
is
brought
before
the
court
and
the
record
says,
“the
court
this
day
appointed
e.
i.
mahoney
as
counsel
to
represent
the
accused,
counsel
notified.”
and
then,
the
record
speaks
with
an
eloquent
sounds
for
one
year
and
24
days
and
the
next
minute
entry
is
january
29th,
1952,
trial
continued
withdrawal
of
counsel.
and
turning
over,
we
see
the
pertinent
part,
e.i
mahoney,
esquire,
moved
the
court
to
allow
him
to
withdraw
his
name
as
counsel
of
record.
and
then,
later
on
through
the
record,
we
find
that
the
defendants'
employed
attorney
came
into
the
case
either
in
march
or
in
june.
and
i
have
studied
the
record
as
carefully
as
i
can
and
i'm
unable
to
ascertain
just
when
mr.
gill,
the
defendants
then
employed
counsel,
came
into
the
case.
it
--
the
record
does
indicate
that
mr.
gill
was
sitting
in
the
courtroom
at
the
time,
here.
but
later,
there
is
testimony
indicating
that
maybe
mr.
gill
came
in,
in
march,
and
maybe
he
came
in,
in
june.
incidentally,
i
might
state
that
i
did
not
come
into
this
case
until
after
rehearing
was
refused
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
the
record
shows
that
he
did
nothing.
i
do
know
that
for
a
substantial
part
of
that
time,
i
personally
know
because
i
knew
mr.
mahoney.
and
i
think
that
everyone
knows
that
is
around
the
court
that
mr.
mahoney
was
in
bed
for
some
seven
months
of
this
period
of
the
year.
now,
just
what
exactly
mr.
mahoney
was
doing
from
the
time
he
was
appointed
until
after
the
three
days,
after
the
end
of
the
grand
jury
time
run
out?
i
do
not
know.
the
record
does
not
state.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
it
ran
out
in
this
case
on
march
5th,
1951
in
the
last
day,
or
rather
the
last
day
upon
which
to
file
would
be
march
8th,
1951.
and
when
the
grand
jury
expired
on
march
5th,
and
the
three-day
period
would
be
march
8th,
as
i
count.
now,
what
mr.
mahoney
did
from
january
until
march
because
i
see
by
the
record
there's
nothing.
mr.
mahoney
is
dead
now,
so
he
can't
even
be
of
any
help.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
we
cannot
tell
from
the
record,
your
honors.
and
of
course,
i
--
i
took
the
record
as
it
--
as
it
came
to
me,
but
i
think
it
is
significant
that
the
only
thing
that
mr.
mahoney
did
in
this
case
was
to
withdraw
from
it
when
apparently,
a
year
later,
this
defendant
family
apparently
got
to
gather
some
money
to
employ
mr.
gill
and
at
about
that
time,
mr.
gill
seems
to
be
hovering
in
the
background
of
the
case
because
the
minute
entry
says
mr.
gill
was
in
court.
so,
it
can
only
be
my
conclusion
from
this
record
that
this
defendant,
during
all
of
the
time
that
his
rights
were
running
out
of
--
was
represented
by
virtually
no
counsel,
counsel
who
did
nothing
whatever
for
him
and
there
was
no
way
of
course
of
getting
that
into
the
--
into
the
record
other
than,
“here
is
the
record,”
at
the
time
that
we
took
up
the
case.
however,
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
however,
the
issue
of
these
defendants'
failure
to
have
effective
and
adequate
representation
by
counsel
was
raised
by
mr.
gill
in
one
of
his
first
or
second
motions
to
quash,
attacking
the
grand
jury
and
it
was
an
issue
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
it
was
a
definite
issue
in
my
petition
for
certiorari
and
it
is
a
definite
issue
in
my
brief
before
this
court
today.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
december
11th,
1950,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
no,
no.
i
think
your
honor
is
confused
with
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
pardon
me.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
he
was
arrested
--
he
was
arraigned
on
january
3rd
and
he
was
not
brought
to
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
january
3rd,
1951.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
december
11th,
1950.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
no,
sir.
that
is
not
this
defendant,
the
other
defendant.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
the
codefendant.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
yes.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
no,
there
are
separate
briefs.
mr.
becker
has
one
brief
and
i
have
one.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
that's
poret
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
poret
was
the
one.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
in
this
case,
the
defendant
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
december
11th,
1950.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
as
best
i
can
see,
february
24th,
1953.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
in
the
meantime
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
looking
at
it
hurriedly.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
in
the
meantime,
the
codefendant
was
not
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
and
as
i
say,
nothing
was
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
nothing
was
done
by
anyone
as
i
stated
in
my
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
i
submit
your
honor
that
this
defendant
was
deprived
of
a
substantial
right
or
substantial
procedure
of
right.
and
i
submit
that
the
--the
record
indicates
that
mr.
mahoney
never
really
felt
that
he
was
ever
going
to
be
in
this
case.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
the
fact
that
he
did
nothing.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
well,
of
course,
all
i
know
is
what
--
what
the
record
shows
that
time.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
well,
your
honor,
as
i
say,
nothing
was
done
for
this
defendant
and
his
rights
ran
out.
now,
here
is
what
i
say,
the
circumstances,
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
case,
and
that
is
why
i
argued
in
point
2,
point
2
of
my
brief
that
the
legal
issue
that
petitioner
was
faced
with
at
the
time,
namely,
the
right
to
go
in
and
challenge
the
grand
jury
under
article
202
was
a
complex
one.
that
is
why
i
quoted
extensively
in
my
brief
from
the
law
review
authorities,
from
the
professors
at
tulane
and
at
louisiana
state
university
who
point
out
that
article
202
is
one
of
the
confusing
technicalities
of
criminal
law.
they
point
out
that
in
many
instances,
article
202
can
be
used
as
a
means
of
circumventing,
the
right
to
make
a
plea
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
yes.
the
only
comment
i
can
say
on
that,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
that
is
a
standard
phrase
used
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
describe
attorneys,
especially
elderly
attorneys
like
mr.
mahoney
who
had
been
practicing
some
52
or
53
years
at
the
time
that
he
was
appointed
in
this
case
and
there
was
some
70
--
i
believe
76
or
78
years
of
age
at
the
time
that
he
was
appointed
in
this
case.
and
that's
just
a
standard
phrase
that
they
say,
“well
he
had
represented
by
able
counsel.”
that's
--
that's
my
only
comment
on
that.
i
don't'
think
it's
a
finding
of
fact
or
anything
else.
i
do
say
that
the
circumstances
was
such
that
labat,
the
defendant,
not
mr.
mahoney,
not
--
not
the
lawyer
but
the
defendant
whose
life
the
state
of
louisiana
seeks
to
take
in
this
proceedings,
the
defendant
could
not
have
intelligently
waived
his
right.
under
the
circumstances,
when
a
lawyer
was
appointed
and
they
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
hire
a
lawyer,”
and
nobody
does
anything
for
him,
the
state
doesn't
do
anything.
he
languishes
in
jail
for
all
that
time,
and
then,
the
state
comes
up,
“article
202,
your
blocked
from
asserting
your
rights,
article
202.”
and
then
you
say,
“labat
waived
his
right.”
how
could
he
have
made
an
intelligent
choice?
no
one
--
no
one
explained
anything
to
him.
he
didn't
have
anything
and
the
complex
situation
of
whether
article
202
applies,
whether
article
--
the
other
various
articles
that
have
been
quoted
in
here
apply,
whether
he
had
a
right
to
go
in
and
file
it
before
a
later
arraignment
and
i
might
say
on
that
score,
i
know
in
--
and
i've
been
with
the
exception
of
the
war
years.
i
was
in
the
district
attorney's
office
prior
to
the
war,
and
since
the
war
have
been
not
exclusively
in
the
criminal
practice,
but
i
have
followed
substantially
the
criminal
practice.
and
i
know
i
have
only
three
cases,
when
article
202
was
used
in
connection
with
the
attack
on
grand
juries
and
i
--
i
even
--
i
mean,
it
have
to
ever
come
in
anywhere.
i
know
of
only
three,
and
those
are
the
wilson
case,
the
labat
case
and
the
michel
case,
the
two
cases
here
before
you
today.
in
all
other
cases
and
in
that
--
and
in
that
choice
to
the
grand
jury
that
mr.
fust
filed
with
the
court,
judge
o'hara
where
as
he
simply
stated
that
whenever
defendants
come
in
and
timely
attack
the
grand
jury,
they
cop
out
of
plea.
so,
here,
we
have
a
situation
wherein
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
they
cop
out
of
plea,
words
to
the
effect
that
they
get
a
--
they
get
a
--
a
lesser
plea,
their
plea
to
a
lesser
offense.
they
come
in
on
a
capital
case,
attack
the
grand
jury
on
the
ground
that
is
discriminatory.
and
the
district
attorney
gives
them
as
judge
o'hara
says,
“an
acute
technical
advantage.”
he
lets
them
plead
to
something
less.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
mr.
gill
came
into
the
case
--
that
is
confusing
from
the
record,
either
in
march
or
in
june.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
he
filed
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
sometime
in
june.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
i
do
--
i
do
not
know
either.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
well,
by
that
time,
under
any
interpretation
of
article
202,
that
--
that
delay
had
already
elapsed.
now,
may
i
go
because
i
want
to
save
some
time
for
my
colleague,
mr.
becker.
may
i
go
to
the
--
the
next
point
in
the
case
that
i
have
argued
and
submitted
on
the
brief
and
that
is,
that
again,
where
this
court
should
assume
the
jurisdiction
in
the
case
of
this
type
to
a
right
or
to
permit
a
defendant,
to
assert
his
federal
rights
in
these
two
well-known
instances
and
i
submit
that
they
both
apply
in
this
case.
and
i
give
the
well-known
instances
that
were
given
by
this
court
by
the
minority
in
the
recent
case
of
williams
versus
georgia
at
the
last
term
of
this
court.
and
that
is,
first,
where
the
circumstances
give
rise
to
an
inference
that
the
state
court
is
guilty
of
an
evasion,
namely,
an
interpretation
of
a
state
law
with
the
specific
intent
to
deprive
a
litigant
of
a
federal
right.
and
i
submit
that
a
clear,
accurate
analysis
of
the
wilson
case
in
all
of
its
circumstances
and
all
of
its
surroundings
will
show
that
the
court
took
the
plain
meaning
of
a
law
which
said,
“you've
got
to
--
you've
got
three
days
here.”
the
motion
was
filed
sometimes
after
that
and
they
reinterpreted
that
so
as
to
put
a
new
time
limit
on
it
and
say,
“ah,
we
got
a
new
time
limit
on
it.”
three
days
after
the
time,
you're
still
too
late
so
you're
electrocuted.
now,
i
submit
that
that
was
an
interpretation
which
later
the
court
itself
said,
“he's
trained
judicial
legislation,
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
that.”
but
we
got
--
we've
got
an
interpretation
here
on
the
wilson
case,
the
(inaudible).
now,
the
law
review
writer,
dr.
bennett
of
louisiana
state
university,
an
outstanding
authority
says,
“this
article
202
as
interpreted
in
the
wilson
case
provides
a
very
complex
situation
especially
when
defendants
are
not
represented
by
counsel
at
arraignment.”
and
the
louisiana
--
i
mean
the
tulane
university
commentator
says,
“this
is
one
of
the
devices
used
by
the
courts
of
louisiana
to
sidestep
the
issue
of
racial
discrimination
in
criminal
cases.”
now,
gentlemen,
you've
held
further
and
secondly
that
where
a
state
law
honestly
though
applied,
and
this
is
a
ground
that
i
would
prefer
to
go
on,
honestly,
though
it
may
be
and
even
dictated
by
presidents,
throws
such
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
enforcement
of
federal
rights
that
it
must
be
struck
down
as
unreasonably
interfering
with
the
vindication
of
those
rights.
now,
we
submit
that
it
has
been
judicially
admitted
here
that
for
the
--
since
the
time
of
men,
the
memory
of
men
run,
not
to
the
country
of
louisiana
has
never
released.
the
parish
of
orleans
has
have
--
never
had
a
negro
on
the
grand
jury
until
just
about
a
month
ago
or
month
and
a
half
ago.
we
submit
that
that
shows
a
prime
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination.
we
submit
that
we
--
this
defendant
should
have
a
right,
having
a
prima
facie
case
before
the
court
should
have
a
right
to
show
it.
we
submit
that
it
is
a
result,
either
of
deliberate
evasion
or
even
though
they
are
honestly
applying
it,
the
obstacles
placed
in
the
way
of
these
defendants
or
actually
asserting
the
right
mean
even
getting
a
day
in
court
as
set
up
and
as
--
as
modelled
up
by
louisiana
with
article
202
is
such
that
it
should
be
struck
down
by
this
court.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
no,
no,
your
honor,
but
when
all
of
the
circumstances
as
indicated
in
this
case
--
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
felicien
y.
lozes
that's
right,
because
he
never
had
the
right
to
have
his
day
in
court
to
show
it.
and
i
submit
that,
your
honor,
in
smith
versus
texas,
this
court
very
amply
expressed
the
rule.
it's
--
this
court
said
in
the
last
lines
of
that
case
at
311
u.s.on
page
128,
“if
there
has
been
discrimination,
whether
accomplished
ingeniously
or
ingeniously,
the
conviction
cannot
stand.”
finally,
your
honors,
i
submit
that
since
both
labat,
my
client,
and
poret,
mr.
becker's
client
were
indicted
by
the
same
grand
jury
and
under
the
same
indictment
itself
that
if
for
any
reason,
your
honors,
should
find
that
a
new
trial
should
be
granted
to
poret,
mr.
becker's
client,
then
the
same
new
trial
should
be
granted
to
my
client
because
the
louisiana
law
has
held
for
some
80
years
that
if
the
grand
jury
falls,
the
indictment
under
is
--
is
illegal.
thank
you.
