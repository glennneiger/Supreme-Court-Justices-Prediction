justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
be
the
9th
of
march?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
your
local
ground
rules
on
timeliness
of
this
motion
as
construed
in
the
wilson
case,
you
had
until
the
5th
of
march
to
make
your
motion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
docket
entries
reflect
your
appointment
on
the
second
remark.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
in
fact
get
a
written
notice,
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
date
of
the
notice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
date
of
the
notice
--
what
date
note
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
date
of
the
notice
carry?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
--
you
make
no
claim
that
as
a
lawyer
you
didn't
know
what
the
wilson
case
held?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
what
hour
of
the
day
on
the
fifth
you
got
your
formal
notice
of
appointment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
puzzles
me
is
the
formality
of
drawing
a
notice
of
motion.
we
would
do
it
for
10
minutes
and
knowing
as
what
you
did
about
the
wilson
case,
even
assuming
that
you
considered
you
had
no
responsibility
on
the
fifth.
you
had
plenty
of
time
to
file
a
standby
motion
there,
didn't
you?
then
as
for
your
adjournment
to
get
up
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
affidavits
or
whatnot.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
reason
i
asked
the
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
the
date
of
your
appointment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
it
--
excuse
me.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
it
--
does
it
appear
in
the
record
whether
judge
hertz,
at
the
time
he
appointed
or
talked
to
mr.
schreiber
about
the
possibility
of
appointing
you,
have
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
designate
you
or
somebody
else
to
act
with
him?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
addition,
you
mean,
to
himself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
does
it
come
about
that
if
the
petit
and
grand
juries
are
drawn
under
the
same
box
that
no
negro
has
ever
served
on
a
grand
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
apart
from
the
timeliness
of
this
motion,
do
you
think
that
a
sufficient
showing
was
made
to
entitle
them
to
a
hearing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
continue?
under
your
practice,
does
the
court
have
a
right
to
extend
the
time
beyond
the
202
period?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
in
that
case
it
had
been
made?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
to
miss
the
judge's
statement
that
he
is
continuing
the
cases.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
mr.
mahoney
doing
in
the
meantime?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
how
can
he
--
how
can
we
tell
from
this
record
whether
he
just
made
a
deliberate
choice
not
to
make
a
motion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
lozes,
on
mr.
mahoney,
we
have
this
much
in
the
record.
your
supreme
court
characterizes
him
as
--
it
says,
“the
defendant,
labat
was
represented
by
able,
learned
and
experienced
counsel
appointed
by
this
court
to
represent
him.”
i
assume
that
refers
to
mr.
labat
or
mr.
mahoney,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
any
attempt
made
at
the
hearing
to
show
what
mahoney's
condition
was?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
it
is
me,
chief
justice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
want
to
ask
you
whether
at
the
time
the
demurrer
proceeding
was
tried
before
judge
heard
you
made
the
claim
that
you'd
understood
that
the
extension
of
the
arraignment
had
operated
to
give
you
a
--
an
extension
of
the
time
to
file
your
motion
to
quash.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
find
anything
on
the
record
to
--
that
indicates
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
point
is
you
didn't
make
it.
that's
--
