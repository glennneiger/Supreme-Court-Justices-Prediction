mr.
george
h.
fust
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
just
to
finish
the
answer
of
mr.
schreiber
to
your
question.
i
was
appointed
by
judge
hertz
after
court
had
adjoined
at
about
1:30
on
the
afternoon
of
friday,
march
the
6th.
it
has
been
our
contention
that
until
judge
hertz
made
his
final
appointment
of
counsel
that
actually
we
weren't
under
any
duty
to
act.
now,
since
i
was
appointed
on
the
fourth
judicial
day
following
the
term
if
we
are
accept
--
or
if
we
are
to
accept
the
wilson
decision
as
being
correct.
we
say
that
it
was
impossible
to
comply
with
the
wilson
case
and
file
our
motion
to
quash
within
the
three
judicial
days
following
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury's
term.
and
before
i
start
into
my
main
argument,
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
which
he
put
to
mr.
schreiber.
is
it
a
fact
that
the
courts
and
lawyers
at
taking
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
has
been
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
grand
juries
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
i
have
before
me
a
document
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
but
i
would
ask
leave
of
this
court
to
make
it
a
part
of
the
record
because
it
is
a
very
important
document.
the
document
is
judge
william
j.
o'hara's
charge
to
the
present
grand
jury
in
which
he
states
in
part
and
i'll
make
this
very
brief,
“every
grand
jury
selected
in
orleans
--
orleans
parish
within
the
memory
of
man
has
been
an
all
white
grand
jury.”
i
like
very
much,
sir,
to
make
this
a
part
of
our
record.
mr.
george
h.
fust
thank
you,
sir.
the
states,
your
honor,
has
in
its
second
argument
said
--
say
that
federal
courts
as
a
general
rule
must
accept
the
interpretation
placed
upon
state
statutes
by
state
courts.
we
admit
that
the
state
of
louisiana
has
the
right
to
pass
a
procedural
law
and
that's
what
article
202
is.
we
further
admit
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
has
a
right
to
interpret
that
law.
but
we
believe
and
we
think
that
the
facts
show
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
did
not
interpret
this
law
in
the
instant
case
and
in
the
case
of
state
versus
wilson,
that
what
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
did
was
to
substantially
and
materially
amend
the
law.
we
would
like
to
call
your
--
mr.
george
h.
fust
i'm
afraid
so,
sir,
because
we've
got
the
three
branches
of
government
--
mr.
george
h.
fust
sir,
we'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
language
used
in
article
202,
which
if
you
run
as
we
referred
to
it
maybe
found
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
article
202,
”all
objections
to
the
manner
of
selecting
or
drawing
any
juror
or
jury
or
to
any
defect
or
irregularity
that
can
be
pleaded
against
any
array
or
venire
must
be
filed,
pleaded,
heard
or
urged
before
the
expiration
of
the
third
judicial
day
of
the
term
for
which
said
jury
shall
have
been
drawn,
etcetera.”
for
50
years
or
more
prior
to
the
wilson
case,
the
statute
meant
what
it
said
that
all
motions
to
quash
must
be
filed,
pleaded
or
urged
before
the
expiration
of
the
third
judicial
day
of
the
term
which
said
jury
shall
had
been
drawn.
that
is
if
the
grand
jury's
term
started
on
the
first
of
the
month,
then
all
objections
must
be
made
before
the
end
of
the
third
day
of
that
month.
if
a
man
was
indicted
after
the
third
day
of
the
grand
jury's
term,
then
there
were
other
articles
in
the
louisiana
criminal
code
which
would
govern
a
situation,
those
articles
being
numbers
284,
286,
and
287.
all
of
which
are
quoted
in
our
brief
on
page
24.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
however,
stated
for
the
first
time
in
the
wilson
case
and
then
repeated
its
opinion
in
our
case
that
article
202
meant
that
all
objections
to
a
jury
or
jurors
must
be
made
before
the
expiration
of
the
third
judicial
day
following
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury's
term.
and
in
the
case
now
before
your
honors,
the
supreme
court
has
made
the
same
ruling.
we
submit
that
the
language
of
article
202
is
clear
that
it
permits
of
no
other
meaning
except
that
the
third
day
of
the
grand
jury's
term
means
the
third
day
from
the
day
the
term
started
and
not
the
third
day
after
the
term
has
ended.
i
got
a
notice
from
this
--
from
the
clerk
of
this
honorable
court
that
this
case
would
be
argued
on
the
8th
day
of
november.
the
language
was
clear
and
here
we
are.
suppose,
your
honors,
we
had
appeared
here
on
december
the
8th
and
you'd
say,
"well,
where
were
you,
mr.
schreiber?
where
were
you
mr.
fust
on
november
the
8th?"
we
said
--
we'd
tell
you,
“well,
your
honors,
on
the
louisiana
interpretation
of
this
language
we
had
a
right
to
be
here
on
december
the
8th.”
i
don't
think
we
would
get
very
far
with
that
argument.
mr.
george
h.
fust
i
don't
believe
so,
sir.
as
i've
stated,
we
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
did
more
than
interpret
article
202
in
its
decision
in
the
wilson
case.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
fust
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
remaining
minutes
we
have
left,
counsel
for
petitioner
will
attempt
to
put
three
questions
before
the
court
and
if
possible
answer
those
questions
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court.
question
number
one,
did
petitioner
in
fact
have
effective
counsel
in
time
for
him
to
comply
with
article
202
as
interpreted
in
the
wilson
decision.
your
honors,
we
submit
that
when
mr.
schreiber
was
told
by
judge
hertz
that
you
are
appointed
as
of
this
day,
march
the
2nd,
of
which
was
the
day
the
grand
jury
term
ended
and
he
was
further
told
by
judge
hertz
that
other
counsel
will
be
appointed
in
this
case.
mr.
schreiber
did
not
know
at
that
time
whether
he
would
be
the
chief
counsel
or
whether
other
counsels,
whether
it
would
be
one
or
more,
would
be
in
charge
of
the
case.
as
it
turned
out,
i
was
appointed
on
march
the
6th
which
was
the
fourth
judicial
day
following
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
term.
and
at
that
time
--
mr.
george
h.
fust
no
dispute
whatsoever.
it's
uncontradicted,
sir.
at
that
time
judge
hertz
told
me
he
was
appointing
me
to
assist
mr.
schreiber
and
that
i
should
get
in
touch
with
mr.
schreiber.
that
he
would
not
send
the
usual
notice.
i
immediately
attempted
to
get
in
touch
with
mr.
schreiber
but
did
not
succeed
in
doing
so
and
instead
i
called
upon
the
defendant
who
was
in
the
parish
prison
at
the
time
and
for
the
first
time
learned
the
facts
of
this
case.
early
the
next
morning,
which
was
a
saturday,
i
succeeded
in
getting
in
touch
with
mr.
schreiber.
and
for
the
first
time,
he
and
i
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
the
facts
of
this
matter
and
we
decided
to
file
this
motion
to
quash.
and
it
was
filed
monday
morning
before
arraignment.
and
we
think
that
it
was
timely
filed,
especially
it
was
timely
filed
if
we
were
to
consider
the
article
202
as
it
had
been
considered
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
for
many,
many
years
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
wilson
case.
because
prior
to
the
wilson
case,
they
had
five
articles
which
dealt
with
objecting
to
indictments
by
grand
juries.
article
202
is
only
one
of
those
five
articles.
articles
284,
285,
286
and
287
of
the
criminal
code
were
the
others.
under
article
202,
if
a
person
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
within
the
first
three
days
of
its
term
and
had
counsel
then
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
file
any
objections
to
that
grand
jury
before
the
expiration
of
the
third
judicial
day
of
the
term.
that
was
counting
from
beginning
of
the
term.
if
a
person
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
at
anytime
after
the
grand
jury's
third
day,
by
then
you
have
these
other
articles
which
provided
that
any
objections
to
the
grand
jury,
because
they
only
dealt
with
indictments,
these
other
articles
284,
285,
286
and
287
report
to
grand
juries
only,
not
to
petit
juries.
any
objections
to
the
grand
jury
must
be
urged
in
a
motion
to
quash,
must
be
pleaded
before
the
arraignment,
which
we
did
in
this
case,
and
must
be
pleaded,
filed
and
the
heard,
before
the
trial
in
any
event.
now,
what
happens
under
the
interpretation
given
to
article
202
in
the
wilson
case?
your
honors,
it
renders
these
other
articles
dealing
with
indictments
by
a
grand
jury,
articles
284,
285,
286
and
287
useless,
useless
in
any
instance
where
the
state
wants
to
take
advantage
of
a
late
appointment.
mr.
george
h.
fust
no,
sir.
they're
still
in
effect,
very
much
so,
sir.
even
now,
if
a
judge
of
any
our
sections
of
the
criminal
district
court
was
to
appoint
a
lawyer
in
the
last
couple
of
days
following
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury's
term.
first
of
all,
as
mr.
schreiber
pointed
out,
that
lawyer
may
not
know
of
his
appointment
until
he
gets
his
official
notice.
when
he
gets
that
official
notice,
then
he's
got
to
take
it
upon
himself
to
immediately
find
out
about
his
case,
about
the
facts
and
see
whether
he
should
file
a
motion
to
quash
such
as
we
filed
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
in
interpreting
article
202
in
the
wilson
case
actually
was
guilty
of
judicial
legislation.
we
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
is
beginning
to
doubt
in
its
own
mind
the
wisdom
of
its
decision
because
we
see
in
one
of
the
--
of
one
of
the
latest
cases
to
come
before
that
court,
namely,
the
state
of
louisiana
versus
joseph
chianelli
of
which
--
the
copy
of
which
opinion
is
the
main
part
of
the
record
by
the
way.
and
in
the
chianelli
case,
your
honors,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
this
to
say
and
we
quote,
"we
conceive
that
this
court's
interpretation
of
article
202
in
the
wilson
case
may
have
been
somewhat
strained.
we
can
see
likewise
that
it
might
be
considered
by
some
to
have
been
judicial
legislation
rather
than
judicial
interpretation.”
nevertheless,
this
court's
construction
and
interpretation
of
article
202
in
the
wilson
case
has
been
approved
by
this
court,
the
same
court
in
two
recent
cases.
and
they
name
our
case,
the
michel
case
and
the
labat
case
which
your
honors
will
also
have
argued
before
you.
in
--
mr.
george
h.
fust
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
fust
no,
sir.
judge
hertz
did
not
tell
mr.
schreiber
who
he
was
going
to
designate.
he
just
told
mr.
schreiber
that
he
would
appoint
other
counsel,
period.
mr.
george
h.
fust
in
addition
to
himself.
mr.
george
h.
fust
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
fust
that
does
appear
in
the
record.
that's
correct
--
mr.
george
h.
fust
--
sir.
now,
to
show
you
further
the
confusion
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
on
this
issue,
these
are
their
closing
remarks
in
this
chianelli
decision.
"we
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
under
the
--
the
interpretation
given
to
article
202
by
the
wilson
case
and
others
following
it,
an
accused
can
indefinitely
--
can
indefinitely
delay
the
trial
of
his
case
by
waiting
until
the
date
fixed
for
trial
to
object
to
the
petit
jury.
this
case
incidentally
concerns
the
petit
jury
and
i
have
one
more
remark
to
state
about
this
case
after
i
finish
here.
however,
to
avoid
these
unnecessary
delays,
article
202
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
requires
legislative,
not
judicial
action
but
the
legislature
in
amending
this
article
should
be
careful
not
to
incorporate
it
--
in
it
any
provision
that
would
subject
the
statute
to
an
attack
on
the
ground
of
denial
of
due
process
--
process
of
law.
actually,
if
article
202
is
correctly
interpreted,
the
intent
of
the
legislature
would
have
been
met.
article
202
is
enacted
to
cover
both
grand
juries
and
petit
juries,
and
if
you
interpret
article
202
to
mean
the
first
three
days
of
the
jury's
term,
right
then
it
would
do
exactly
what
the
legislature
wanted
it
to
do,
have
all
attacks
against
petit
juries
urged
before
the
trial.
and
not
to
have
the
trial
and
then
give
them
an
opportunity
to
attack
the
petit
jury.
mr.
george
h.
fust
not
in
our
case,
sir,
but
--
mr.
george
h.
fust
--
in
the
chianelli
case.
mr.
george
h.
fust
no,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
fust
it
has
been
made.
mr.
george
h.
fust
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
fust
that's
correct,
sir.
and
an
--
an
amusing
thing
about
the
chianelli
case,
the
state
in
the
chianelli
case
is
urging
that
the
motion
to
quash
is
not
good
because
it
wasn't
filed
within
the
first
three
judicial
days.
mr.
george
h.
fust
of
the
term.
they
just
changed
their
position.
mr.
george
h.
fust
the
state
did,
not
the
state
of
louisiana,
the
attorney
who's
representing
the
state.
however,
the
state
supreme
court
reversed
the
trial
judge
in
this
matter.
mr.
george
h.
fust
exactly,
sir,
exactly.
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
george
h.
fust
sir?
mr.
george
h.
fust
no,
the
supreme
court
did
not.
the
--
the
supreme
court
stuck
to
its
decision
of
state
versus
wilson.
mr.
george
h.
fust
no,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
fust
no,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
fust
you
may
infer
that,
sir.
we
were
satisfied
as
counsel
for
michel
that
the
petit
jury
was
satisfactory
to
us
and
to
our
clients.
mr.
george
h.
fust
largely
so,
sir.
you
are
correct.
i
think
the
document
that
i
was
allowed
to
introduce
into
the
record
yesterday
will
prove
that.
no
negro
has
ever
served
on
a
grand
jury
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
mr.
george
h.
fust
that's
correct,
sir.
because
we
--
we
do
have
juries,
petit
juries
down
in
louisiana
with
negroes
included.
mr.
george
h.
fust
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
h.
fust
the
third
question
was
has
there
been
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
grand
juries
in
all
ends?
and
i
think
that
we
have
shown
that
by
the
information
which
we
were
prepared
to
offer
and
prove
in
support
of
our
motion
to
quash.
but
we
were
not
allowed
to
--
to
even
offer
it,
even
though
we
filed
a
motion
to
perpetuate
testimonies,
we
weren't
allowed
to
do
it.
and
the
comment
i
have
to
make
here
that
as
long
as
article
202
is
allowed
to
have
the
interpretation
as
called
for
in
the
wilson
case
then
i'm
afraid
that
this
court
is
allowing
something
to
exist
which
will
allow
the
--
allow
for
continued
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
grand
