mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
may
it
please
the
court.
if
your
honors
please,
this
case,
the
case
of
the
state
of
louisiana
versus
john
michel
and
the
case
that
is
immediately
following
this,
the
case
of
the
state
of
louisiana
versus
labat
and
poret
are
both
petitions
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
for
writs
of
certiorari
from
capital
convictions
for
the
crimes
of
aggravative
rape.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
defendants
are
negroes.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
--
the
prosecuting
witnesses
were
in
one
case,
the
case
of
john
michel,
a
young
white
lady.
in
the
case
of
the
state
of
louisiana
versus
labat
and
poret,
it
was
an
older
white
lady.
now,
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
defendants,
through
their
counsel
filed
motions
to
quash
their
indictments
and
both
of
them
haven't
been
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
for
the
parish
of
orleans.
both
of
them
filed
motions
to
quash
the
indictments
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
a
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
juries
in
the
parish
of
orleans
since
time
memorable
and
from
these
particular
grand
juries
that
indicted
these
defendants.
in
both
of
these
cases,
we
stood
ready
to
prove
that
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
which
is
coextensive
with
the
parish
of
orleans
is
approximately
one-third
negro,
consisting
of
some
230,000
people
--
230,000
negroes
of
which
there
were
countless
numbers
that
were
prominent,
educated,
businessmen
and
professional
men.
and
countless
numbers
of
whom
they
had
been
educated
in
elementary
schools,
high
schools
and
universities
of
which
we
had
a
--
have
a
negro
university
in
the
city
of
the
orleans
since
1869.
having
filed
our
motions
to
quash
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
state
filed
demurrer
to
our
motions
to
quash
on
the
grounds
that
the
motions
to
quash
were
filed
too
late.
and
in
both
of
the
cases,
the
state's
demurrer
was
sustained
and
we
were
denied
the
opportunity
and
the
right
to
offer
our
evidence
in
support
of
our
motion
to
quash.
and
in
both
of
these
cases,
if
your
honor
--
honors
please,
we
are
here
complaining
that
that
action
has
denied
to
our
clients,
the
defendants
in
these
particular
cases
the
due
process
of
law
that's
guaranteed
to
them
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
the
fact
--
now,
i
answer
it
in
this
way,
sir.
the
fact
that
there
has
been
a
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
juries
in
the
parish
of
orleans
is
a
judicially
admitted
and
proven
fact.
just
recently,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
motion
to
quash
such
as
this
was
sustained
by
one
of
the
--
the
trial
judges
for
the
parish
of
orleans.
it
is
judicially
admitted
and
it's
judicially
proven
that
there
has
been
such
a
systematic
exclusion.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
not
in
this
particular
case.
we
didn't
get
that
far.
we
only
got
as
far
as
to
file
our
motion
to
quash
to
which
the
demurrer
was
filed,
the
demurrer
was
sustained.
we
did
not
get
to
offer
--
offer
(inaudible)
now
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
you
mean,
presuming
--
presuming
that
there
was
a
sufficient
amount
of
time
alloted
to
counsel?
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
best
way
that
i
can
answer
that
is
to
cite
to
your
honors,
in
which
i
propose
to
do
in
the
case
of
powell
versus
alabama,
wherein
this
court
had
said
that
not
only
does
the
defendant
have
the
right
to
counsel
but
he
also
has
the
right
to
effective
counsel
appointed
at
a
time
and
under
such
circumstances
whereby
the
counsel
is
going
to
render
to
that
particular
defendant
the
effect
of
aid.
now,
of
course,
one
of
these
cases
are
--
is
going
to
come
up
involving
a
period
of
time.
in
our
particular
case,
the
time
interval
is
an
extremely
sharp
interval.
and
all
of
this
time,
question
arises
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
article
202
of
our
code
of
criminal
procedure
in
the
state
of
louisiana
provides
in
substance
that
attacks
on
the
grand
jury
or
a
petit
jury
must
be
urged
before
the
expiration
of
the
third
judicial
day
of
the
term
for
which
the
jury
has
been
impaneled
of
the
term
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
certainly,
there
--
there
must
be
a
time
beyond
which
you
cannot
urge
motions
to
quash.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
my
co-counsel
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
then
we
--
we're
(voice
overlap)
saying
that
first
of
all,
this
man
at
that
time,
when
his
time
was
running
out,
we
say
that
he
did
not
have
an
attorney
by
virtue
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
and
we
say
secondly,
that
if
your
honors
feel
that
he
did
have
an
attorney,
then
by
no
means
he
--
did
he
have
an
attorney
who
was
rendering
to
him
the
effect
of
aid,
both
of
which
falls
within
the
purview
of
the
powell
versus
alabama
case,
which
set
both
of
those
rules.
now,
if
your
honor
--
honors
please,
the
--
the
time
interval,
the
date
sequence
in
this
particular
case
is
applying
of
crime
importance.
this
crime
is
allegedly
had
been
committed
on
february
the
10th,
1953.
the
defendant,
john
michel
was
arrested
on
or
about
february
the
13th,
1953.
he
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
on
or
about
february
the
19th,
1953.
he
was
initially
brought
up
for
arraignment
two
judicial
days
following
the
return
of
his
indictment
on
february
the
23rd,
1953.
now,
i'd
like
to
deviate
here
to
tell
you
just
a
little
bit
something
about
the
grand
jury
for
the
parish
of
orleans,
the
grand
juries
for
the
parish
of
orleans
are
selected
to
serve
for
a
six-month
period.
there's
one
of
them
that's
impaneled
in
september
to
serve
until
the
following
march
and
then
a
new
grand
jury
is
in
impaneled
to
serve
from
march
until
september.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
this
was
the
grand
jury
that
had
been
selected
in
september
1952
to
serve
until
march
1953.
now,
this
man
was
indicted
by
that
grand
jury
on
february
the
19th,
shortly
before
their
term
was
expiring.
he
was
brought
up
on
february
the
23rd,
1953,
two
judicial
days
following
the
return
of
his
indictment.
at
that
particular
time,
he
was
asked
by
judge
hertz,
the
trial
judge,
if
he
was
represented
by
a
counsel.
he
told
he
was
not
and
he
--
judge
hertz
asked
him,
was
he
going
to
be
able
to
employ
counsel
and
he
told
the
judge
that
he
thought
that
his
family
was
going
to
be
able
to
get
money
to
employ
a
counsel.
so
judge
hertz
continued
the
arraignment
until
the
following
monday,
february
23rd
was
a
monday,
and
he
continued
the
arraignment
until
march
the
2nd
the
following
monday.
now,
just
so
happened
that
on
that
particular
monday,
march
the
2nd,
the
term
of
that
grand
jury
was
expiring.
that
was
their
last
day
in
office
and
a
new
grand
jury
was
being
impaneled
on
that
day.
now,
during
the
course
of
this
ensuing
wait,
when
judge
hertz
continued
this
arraignment,
he
discussed
with
me
whether
i
will
take
the
case
and
i
told
him
if
i
could
help
the
court,
i
would
take
the
appointment.
however,
he
didn't
appoint
me,
he
merely
discussed
the
case.
on
march
the
2nd,
and
incidentally
i'm
not
deviating
from
the
record.
if
your
honors
please,
this
is
all
born
out
by
the
record.on
march
the
2nd,
this
man
was
brought
up
again
for
arraignment
and
i
have
to
be
sitting
down
in
court
on
other
business.
and
the
judge
asked
him,
had
he
been
able
to
employ
a
counsel
and
he
said
no.
so
the
judge
pointing
to
me,
he
says
--
well,
he
says,
“i'm
going
to
appoint
mr.
schreiber
to
represent
you."
the
judge
had
also
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
appoint
several
attorneys
in
the
case.
so
nothing
further
happened.
the
judge,
he
recites
solely
in
the
record.
the
judge
continued
the
arraignment
himself
for
another
week
until
the
following
monday.
he
continued
the
arraignment
because
he
said
that
--
i
had
said
that
i
didn't
know
anything
about
the
case
which
i
did
not
and
that
he
wanted
to
give
me
time
to
look
into
the
case
and
so
forth.
so
he
continued
the
arraignment
for
one
week,
five
judicial
days
after
that.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
the
9th
of
march,
yes.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
that
is
correct,
sir.
we
--
under
the
ruling
(voice
overlap)
of
the
wilson
case,
we
had
until
the
--
until
the
5th
of
march.we
need
to
file
a
motion.
now,
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
there
is
another
practice
that
we
have
and
that
is
the
serving
of
written
notice
of
appointment
on
counsel.
in
many
instances
of
course
as
you
know
the
judge
does
not
discuss
appointment
--
appointments
with
counsel.
he
appoints
them.
he
--
he
tells
the
--
the
clerk
to
send
him
a
notice
and
a
notice
is
sent
out.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
judge
said
i
am
going
to
appoint
mr.
schreiber
and
myself,
i
received
my
written
notice
on
march
the
5th.
now,
i
did
not
consider
myself
to
have
been
appointed
as
this
man's
counsel
until
such
time
as
i
received
that
written
notice
from
the
court
of
my
appointment.
i
considered
my
appointment
need
to
be
a
very
indefinite
thing
up
until
that
particular
time.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
it
was
--
it
was
in
open
court
and
he
said,
"i
am
going
to
appoint
mr.
schreiber
in
open
court.”
now
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
the
--
the
endorsement
--
the
endorsement
to
the
indictment
shows
that
i
was
appointed
on
march
the
2nd
and
of
course
there
is
where
the
great
difference
of
opinion
came
up
between
myself
and
judge
hertz's
born
out
by
the
transcript
as
to
exactly
when
i
was
appointed.
i
felt
that
it
was
indefinite
up
until
the
time
that
i
received
confirmation
of
it
and
of
course
the
--
actually,
his
--
his
recollection
of
it
was
not
too
good
either
because
he
said
that
--
that
he
had
appointed
mr.
fust
on
march
the
2nd
too.
this
is
also
in
the
record.
whereas,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
doesn't
even
show
that
mr.
fust
was
ever
appointed
or
he
appeared
with
me
at
all
times,
in
all
stages
of
proceedings.
however,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
he
was
ever
appointed
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
fust
himself,
took
the
witness
stand
and
testified
that
the
first
notice
that
he
had
of
his
appointment
was
on
march
the
6th
when
judge
hertz
told
him
that
he
was
going
to
appoint
me
and
that
he
was
not
going
to
send
him
a
written
notice
and
mr.
fust
said,
"well,
it's
not
necessary
that
you
send
me
a
written
notice.
i'll
accept
this
as
being
my
appointment."
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
received
it
on
march
the
5th,
which
is
purposely
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
don't
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
do
not
know,
sir.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
no,
sir.
they're
--
they
are
served
by
a
sheriff
and
deputy
sheriff.
of
course
you
can
appreciate
the
fact
there's
a
time
interval
that
is
involved.
the
arraignment
takes
place
on
--
on
the
2nd
then
he's
got
to
down
to
the
clerk's
office
and
the
clerk
issues
the
--
issues
the
notice
and
then
he
has
to
go
to
the
--
to
the
sheriff's
office
and
the
sheriff
serves
it,
he's
receiving
it
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
receiving
it
only
three
days
later,
it
is
a
good
period
of
time.
customarily,
it
takes
a
little
bit
longer
than
three
days.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
he
does.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
that
is
not
in
this
record.
but
we
--
it's
a
--
i
think
it's
judicially
admitted
the
fact
that
it
was
served
approximately,
let's
say
march
the
5th.
and
the
return
was
made
in
the
record
and
i
admit
that
i
received
at
that
time.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir,
immediately.
the
old
one
is
not
discharged
until
a
new
one
is
impaneled.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
there
was
one
--
no,
we
have
six
--
six
sections
of
the
criminal
district
court
for
the
parish
of
orleans
and
they
rotate
the
grand
jury.
their
designated
section
a,
b,
c,
and
so
forth
and
they
rotated,
a
has
it
for
one
six
months,
and
b
gets
the
next
one
and
so
forth.
this
did
not
happen
to
be
judge
hertz's
grand
jury,
neither
one
of
them,
either
the
new
one
or
the
old
one
as
i
recall
it.
it
was
in
some
other
section.
so
anyway,
we
--
we
went
ahead
and
we
filed
our
motion
to
quash
on
march
the
9th.
now,
through
our
motion
to
quash,
the
--
the
state
filed
the
demurrer
and
as
i
have
recited
to
your
honors,
the
state's
demurrer
was
sustained
and
we
never
got
the
opportunity
to
offer
evidence
in
support
of
our
motion
to
quash
and
that
is
what
we
are
here,
we're
complaining
about
it.
now,
the
reason
why,
if
your
honors
please,
the
reason
why
this
demurrer
was
filed
was
because
of
the
state,
the
case
of
state
versus
wilson.
now,
article
202
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
of
the
state
of
louisiana
does
not
say,
does
not
say
that
it
has
to
be
filed
before
the
third
judicial
day
following
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
term.
article
202,
he
says
it
has
to
be
filed
before
the
third
judicial
day
of
the
term
for
which
the
grand
jury
has
been
impaneled.
it
was
the
case
of
state
versus
wilson
that
came
along
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
of
the
day,
yes.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir,
of
the
term.
that's
of
the
term.
that's
what
--
what
202
says.
the
case,
state
versus
wilson
came
along
and
in
the
case
of
state
versus
wilson,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
interpreted
of
--
in
that
particular
article
to
mean
following
the
expiration
of
the
term.
so
that
if
--
if
in
our
particular
case,
if
202
would
have
been
applied
literally,
our
time
for
filing
that
motion
would
have
expired
on
the
first
three
--
the
first
three
days
of
the
grand
jury
term.
but
the
case
of
state
versus
wilson
came
along
and
as
a
consequence,
the
state
urged
that
our
time
expired
or
after
the
expiration
of
the
third
judicial
day
following
the
grand
jury
term.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
no.
no,
sir,
i
--
no,
sir,
i
do
not
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
that
was
on
the
books
at
the
time?
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
it
was
on
the
books
at
the
time.
the
case,
state
versus
wilson
was
decided
in
the
--
in
the
early
1940s.
i
do
make
a
claim
to
certain
practice
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
all
of
which
also
is
born
by
the
record
that
we
had
filed
here
with
your
honors
and
that
is
the
practice
of
permitting
motions
to
quash
to
--
such
as
this
to
be
filed
at
any
time
before
--
before
arraignment.
although,
the
grand
jury
term
has
long
expired
--
long
expired,
we
cite
two
cases
in
here
where
the
state
permitted
a
motion
to
quash
such
as
this
to
be
filed
long
after
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
term.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
am
--
i
am
saying
that
--
that
that
was
the
practice
that
is
born
out
by
the
record
and
i
do
say
that
it
was
disregarded
in
this
particular
case,
as
well
as
that
of
the
case
following
this,
labat
and
poret.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
just
say
that
they
did
it.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
don't
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
--
i
can't
say
that
the
case
was
singled
out.
i
would
not
infer,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
my
state
of
louisiana
and
in
my
parish
of
orleans
that
we
have
a
discriminatory
practice
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
do
not
think
--
i
do
not
think
that
--
that
it
was
such.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
think
that
--
that
in
this
particular
case,
article
202,
the
provisions
as
interpreted
by
state
versus
wilson
was
literally
applied.
it
is
the
law.
there's
no
question
about
it.
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
it
is
the
law.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
and
if
you
bound
to
follow
that
construction
and
could
find
no
fault
with
that
construction
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
no,
i
don't
think
that
you
are
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
is
high
bound
to
follow
the
--
the
interpretation.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
didn't
want
to
get
on
the
case
of
state
versus
wilson.
my
co-counsel
here,
mr.
fust,
was
going
to
talk
about
the
case
of
state
versus
wilson
and
i
don't
want
to
steal
his
thunder.
i
--
i
wanted
to
--
if
possible,
explore
the
powell
versus
alabama
case.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
am
going
to
address
--
address
my
remarks
toward
the
--
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
powell
versus
alabama,
wherein
this
court
held
four
propositions.
one
is
that
under
the
due
process
law
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
right
of
counsel.
and
secondly,
that
he
is
entitled
to
the
right
of
counsel
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding.
and
the
third
thing
that
that
case
held
was
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
are
surrounding
the
case,
dictate
the
necessity
for
a
counsel
in
some
cases
more
than
in
others.
and
the
fourth
thing
that
the
case
of
powell
versus
alabama
held
was
that
that
right
to
counsel
was
at
a
time
and
under
such
circumstances
as
court
rendered
effective
aid
to
the
defendant.
and
if
your
honors
please,
we
say
with
reference
to
that,
that
first
of
all,
this
man
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
at
the
time
when
his
time
was
running
out.
at
the
time
those
--
during
those
three
--
three
days
when
his
time
was
running
out.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir,
between
the
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
and
we
say
that
regardless
of
what
the
record
shows
and
rightfully
or
wrongfully,
i
am
here
admitting
the
fact
that
during
those
three
--
three
days,
i
did
absolutely
nothing.
i
did
nothing
until
i
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
state
what
sir?
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
if
your
honors
pleases,
i
think
--
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
capital
case,
the
fact
that
a
motion
to
quash
an
indictment
is
a
technical
pleading,
the
fact
that
it
takes
time
and
deliberation
and
facts,
facts
that
are
not
readily
available
in
order
to
perfect
a
good
motion
to
quash.
the
fact
also
that
in
this
particular
case
it
was
a
court
appointment.
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
i
believe
that
those
three
judicial
days
as
applied
to
this
particular
case,
now
these
facts
that
i
have
recited
to
you,
i
think
that
it
is
an
unreasonable
--
unreasonably
short
period
of
time
to
expect
action.
now,
i
can
only
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
this
particular
--
this
particular
point
has
ever
come
before
the
courts
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
in
the
case
of
state
versus
wilson,
it
was
a
motion
to
quash
that
had
been
filed
long
after
the
grand
jury
term
had
expired.
the
--
it
wasn't
this
three-day
interval.
it
just
--
just
so
happened
that
on
this
--
this
march
the
2nd,
that
grand
jury
term
expired
on
that
very
same
day
and
that's
--
that's
a
fact
that
complicates
this
particular
--
not
complicates
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
by
way
of
passing?
yes.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
think
that
something
that
this
court
should
consider
very
definitely
whether
--
whether
that
--
those
three
--
three
days
is
an
unreasonably
short
period
of
time.
however,
that's
not
our
main
contention.
our
main
contentions
are
first,
that
he
never
had
counsel
during
these
days
and
if
--
if
the
record
--
if
you
are
high
bound
to
follow
the
--
the
per
curiam
of
the
judge
and
follow
the
endorsement
on
the
indictment,
then
we
say
very
definitely
that
he
did
not
have
effect
of
counsel
during
those
--
those
three
days.
and
i
mean
whether
it
was
rightfully
done
or
wrongfully
done,
the
fact
remains
that
he
didn't
have
it
and
according
to
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
the
motion
was
filed
on
march
the
9th,
which
was
the
fifth
judicial
day
following
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
term.
march
the
2nd
was
monday,
march
the
9th.
and
of
course
we
don't
have
any
--
any
court
on
saturday
and
sunday,
so
as
the
fifth
judicial
day
following
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
oh,
we
prepared
it.
actually,
it
was
filed
the
second
judicial
day
after
--
after
i
received
the
notice
of
my
appointment.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
don't
follow
you,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
time
permitting.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
it's
time
permitting.
i'm
not
sure
what
was
happening
on
the
second
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
--
and
during
the
fourth.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
i
say
actually
that
the
very
court
that
--
the
trial
court,
this
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
we
cite
in
here
the
case
of
--
of
alfred
dowell.
i
think
that's
his
--
his
name.
in
the
testimony
that
--
that
we
took
in
support
of
our
answer
to
our
demurrer.
the
--
we
offered
in
evidence
the
indictment
in
the
case
of
state
of
louisiana
versus
alfred
dowell.
it's
contained
on
page
31
of
our
transcript.
and
in
that
case
--
that
was
a
case
pending
before
section
a
of
the
criminal
district
court
for
the
parish
of
orleans.
and
in
that
case,
the
motion
to
quash
was
filed
on
the
same
grounds
and
judge
o'hara,
the
presiding
judge
of
section
a,
quashed
the
indictment.
and
of
course
we
have
had
the
--
which
is
outside
the
record
but
judge
--
the
present
grand
jury
is
judge
o'hara's
grand
jury.
and
judge
o'hara,
he
has
placed
several
negroes
on
the
grand
jury,
which
is
the
first
time
that
that
has
ever
happened.
these
--
these
are
facts
that
have
been
offered
in
support
of
other
motions
to
quash
such
as
this
and
these
--
these
are
judicially
proven
facts
and
i
think
by
virtue
of
the
action
taken
by
judge
o'hara,
they
are
also
judicially
admitted
facts.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
on
march
the
2nd.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
this
--
no,
that
was
the
last
day,
that
was
the
last
day
of
the
--
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
john
michel.
that
was
the
last
day
of
that
term.
the
new
grand
jury
was
impaneled
on
march
the
2nd.
they
--
the
--
the
one
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
they
hold
the
grand
jury
in
office
until
--
they
usually
swear
the
grand
jury
in
about
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
and/or
at
10:30,
when
the
court
opens
and
they
hold
one
grand
jury
in
office
until
such
time
as
the
second
one
has
been
sworn
in
and
the
minute
that
the
second
one
has
been
sworn
in,
the
judge
discharged
the
first
--
discharges
the
first
one.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
no,
sir.
the
record
would
not
show
that.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
i
can't
--
i
can't
say
mr.
justice.
i
can't
say
at
what
time
on
the
fifth
i
received
the
notice.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
the
--
the
notice
--
the
notice
may
have
been
served
on
my
secretary,
which
is
customarily
what
happens.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sheriff
doesn't
wait
until
i
arrive
in
my
office.
he
leaves
it
--
leaves
it
with
the
secretary,
he
leaves
it
with
one
of
your
law
partners,
anything
like
that.
and
actually,
i
could
not
say
on
--
at
what
time
i
received
the
particular
notice.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
no
sir,
it
is
not
in
the
record.
but
the
notice
wouldn't
--
the
notice
wouldn't
die.
i
don't
think
the
sheriff's
return
shows
the
time.
it
shows
the
date
and
it
shows
the
person
on
whom
it
was
served
but
i
don't
think
it
shows
the
time.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
there's
no
--
the
--
it's
testified,
there's
testimony
in
the
record
when
--
when
i
was
appointed
--
i
mean
when
i
--
when
i
received
the
notice,
it's
not
controverted.
i
--
i
took
the
witness
stand
myself
and
testified
that
i
received
it
on
march
the
5th.
there's
--
there
was
no
contrary
evidence
offered.
the
motion
wasn't
brought
out
to
show
that
it
wasn't
true.
so,
if
your
honors
please,
that
is
the
gist
of
our
complaints
about
this
action
and
more
particularly,
the
point
that
i
have
sought
to
explore
is
that
--
that
has
a
bearing
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
powell
versus
alabama.
we
say
very
definitely
that
this
man
even
if
this
court
holds
that
he
did
have
counsel,
we
say
very
definitely
the
man
did
not
have
effective
counsel.
and
going
further
with
reference
to
the
case
of
state
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
we
raised
it
in
our
petition.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
oh,
yes,
sir.
we
raised
this
--
we
raised
this
in
louisiana.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
of
this
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
the
--
this
is
--
this
is
raised
by
way
of
bill
of
exception.
number
one
--
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
we
reserved
42
bills
of
exception.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
and
this
was
--
this
was
bill
number
one
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
bill
number
one
was
submitted
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
and
there
is
--
there
is
the
further
--
the
further
point
that
i
would
like
to
raise
and
that
is
that
your
honors
have
to
consider
the
practice
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
your
honors
have
to
consider
the
fact
that
written
notice
is
given.
your
honors
have
to
consider
the
fact
that
motions
to
quash
are
permitted
to
be
filed
at
any
time
before
arraignment.
and
in
this
particular
case,
that's
exactly
what
has
done
--
what
was
done.
your
honors
have
to
consider
which
is
borne
out,
all
of
this
is
borne
out
by
the
record.
your
honors
have
to
consider
in
--
in
many
instances
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
show
--
to
show
that
the
arraignment
is
the
crux
of
the
thing
that
in
many
instances
and
in
several
of
the
--
in
the
cases
cited
by
us,
the
court
permits
the
withdrawing
of
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
an
indictment
in
order
that
a
motion
to
quash
may
be
filed.
now,
your
honors
also
have
to
consider
that
this
--
this
arraignment
from
march
the
2nd
until
march
the
9th
was
not
continued
by
me.
i
didn't
continue
the
arraignment.
it
was
continued
by
the
court
and
that
is
borne
out
by
the
transcript
of
the
record
too.
so
that
your
honors
have
to
consider
that
if
i
did
wrong
in
not
hurrying
out,
rushing
to
file
this
motion
to
quash,
that
i
was
definitely
misled
not
--
not
purposely
by
the
court
or
anything
like
that.
i
was
just
misled
by
the
practice
into
thinking
that
i
had
time
before
that
arraignment
need
to
file
this
motion
to
quash
and
that's
what
was
done.
it
was
filed
before
the
arraignment.
it
was
filed
the
fifth
judicial
day
following
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
term.
it
was
filed
the
second
judicial
day
after
i
received
a
written
notice
of
my
appointment.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
they
have
been
--
they
have
been
recently.
as
a
result,
the
line
of
jurisprudence
that
this
court
has
decided
and
that
they're
being
filed
quite
considerably
where
a
negro
and
a
white
person
is
--
is
involved.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes
sir,
i
was.
that's
--
that's
the
reason
why
i
know
about
--
about
the
dowell
case
and
the
green
case.
i
was
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
section
b
and
the
green
case
came
before
my
section
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
mean
that's
how
we
know
about
this.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
oh,
i
know
about
the
wilson
case.
the
--
the
thing
is
that
i
just
very
definitely
didn't
feel
that
i
have
been
appointed.
it
--
it
was
a
very
inconclusive
thing.
it
was
not
such
as,
"you
are
appointed
mr.
schreiber,"
or
anything
like
that.
i
don't
know
the
endorsement
on
the
indictment
is
made
by
a
clerk.
i
don't
know
what
endorsement
was
made
--
made
on
the
indictment
by
a
clerk
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
inconclusive
thing.
the
judge
says
--
as
he
says
in
the
transcript,
i
continued
the
case
to
give
you
time
to
look
into
it
and
so
forth.
it
was
completely
inconclusive.
now
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
don't
believe,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
think
it's
just
accustomed.
i
don't
believe
the
statute
requires
it.
i
think
it's
just
accustomed,
but
it
is
accustomed.
it's
an
unvarying
custom
as
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
judge
hertz
told
mr.
fust,
"i'm
not
going
to
send
you
a
written
notice."
and
mr.
fust
said,
"well,
it's
not
necessary
that
you
send
me
a
written
notice.
i'll
accept
this
as
being
my
appointment."
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
that's
borne
out
also
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
--
by
the
record,
by
judge
hertz's
testimony
in
this
record,
not
by
my
testimony.
judge
hertz's
says
that.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
if
your
honor
pleases
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
--
that
is
borne
out
of
the
--
by
the
record.
the
--
mr.
hubert
was
mistaken.
the
case
that
we
cite
in
here,
the
robert
green
case,
that
never
did
go
to
the
state
of
--
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
nor
did
the
alfred
dowels
case
go
to
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
these
two
cases
as
i
recall
the
circumstances,
the
robert
green
case
was
eventually
(inaudible),
if
i
remember
correctly.
i
was
out
of
the
district
attorney's
office
at
the
time
but
if
my
recollection
of
it
is
that
it
was
eventually
(inaudible)
the
alfred
dowels
case
is
the
case
where
judge
o'hara
quashed
the
indictment.
now,
those
were
the
two
cases
where
the
court
long
after
the
expiration
of
the
grand
jury
term
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
the
defendant
had
pleaded
to
the
indictment,
had
pleaded
not
guilty,
had
been
arraigned,
permitted
the
withdrawing
of
that
plea
of
not
guilty
in
order
that
a
motion
to
quash
could
be
filed.
that
is
cited
in
the
testimony
taken
in
support
of
--
or
our
--
our
answer
to
the
demurrer
filed
by
the
state.
what
happened
in
the
thing
is
the
--
that
we
filed
our
motion
to
quash,
the
state
filed
their
demurrer
to
our
motion
to
quash.
we
filed
an
answer
to
their
demurrer.
in
support
of
our
answer
to
the
demurrer,
we
took
notes
of
evidence
where
i
testified,
mr.
fust
testified
and
the
judge
testified.
and
all
of
that
is
in
this
record.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
the
testimony
is
here.
we
made
it
part
of
the
bill
of
exception
that
we
presented
to
the
state
of
louisiana.
and
it's
in
that
testimony
where
judge
hertz
says,
"i
continued
the
case.”
i
didn't
continue
it.
when
judge
hertz
says
you
requested
the
continuance,
i
had
to
say
well,
judge,
i'll
have
to
take
exception
to
that.
i
was
on
the
stand
testifying
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
--
i'll
have
to
take
exception
to
that.
i
didn't
continue
it.
and
he
says,
no.
he
says,
i
contended
it.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
so
all
of
that
is
part
of
it.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
will
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
will
say
with
reference
to
this
particular
case
that
this
is
the
first
case
following
the
wilson
case,
that
in
my
knowledge
where
a
--
a
demurrer
was
filed
to
a
motion
to
quash
of
this
type.
now,
in
my
experience
it
does
not
extend
back
into
the
wilson
case.
mr.
becker's
experience
does
extend
that
far
back.
he
perhaps
can
answer
that
better
than
i
can.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
this
is
the
first
case
where
they
did
it.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
say
it
happened.
now,
i
would
not
say
either
judge
hertz.
and
i
would
not
say
that
judge
hertz
deliberately
waited
up
until
a
certain
time
he
had
so
forth
to
appoint
me
not
by
any
means
at
all.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
mr.
justice
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
don't
have
to
make
that
contention,
it
happened.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
all
of
this
went
before
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
i
--
i
--
of
course
in
our
practice
before
louisiana,
we
reserved
those
with
exceptions.
and
we
present
these
bills
into
--
to
the
supreme
court
before
a
review.
then
we
argue
our
bills
before
the
supreme
court.
now,
all
of
the
things
that
we
are
talking
about
are
part
of
our
bill
of
exception
number
one.
now,
as
i
say
we
reserved
42
bills.
now,
whether
i
specifically
call
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana's
attention
to
this
specific
thing
or
not,
i
cannot
say
yet
at
this
time.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
no.
if
your
honor
pleases,
we
do
not
do
solely.
i
might
say
that
with
reference
to
that
in
that
we
were
not
going
to
urge
this
question
of
time
before
this
court.
last
week,
mr.
fust
and
i,
we
conformed
with
reference
to
this
case.
and
we
felt
that
we
would
be
making
a
big
mistake
if
we
did
not
urge
what,
at
this
particular
time,
we
consider
to
be
a
very,
very
important
issue
in
this
case.
and
unfortunately,
this
brief
was
printed
by
--
by
this
--
by
the
--
the
court
and
we
had
no
time,
this
only
happened
last
week.
we
had
no
time
to
get
another
--
issue
a
supplemental
brief
and
a
request
that
it
be
printed
so
that
we
come
up
here
and
we
orally
urge
at
this
particular
time.
but
it
is
--
it
is
raised
in
our
petition
for
writs
of
certiorari.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
no,
sir.
well,
it
--
it
--
we
thought
of
this
important
point.
we
did
know
whether
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
--
we
didn't
know
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
--
whether
--
no,
sir,
not
in
our
brief.
in
our
petition
we
have
raised
it.
but
we
didn't.
at
that
particular
time
we
--
we
didn't
think
that
--
that
it
was
important
for
many
reasons.
maybe
we
just
didn't
want
--
want
to
raise
it
because
we
didn't
think
we
were
going
to
get
any
results
out
of
it.
however
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
--
it
is
a
significant
point.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
we
didn't
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
we
didn't
reject
it.
there
are
a
lot
of
points
that
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
no,
sir,
the
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
that's
the
only
thing.
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
put
it
in
our
brief.
of
course,
our
brief
is
only
a
written
--
a
written
argument.
and
we
raise
it
at
this
time
by
way
of
oral
argument.
and
as
matter
of
fact
with
the
--
the
request,
the
--
that
we'd
like
to
make
to
the
court
that
we
be
given
the
time
to
file
a
--
supplement
brief
covering
this
particular
point,
if
your
honors
would
like
to
have
it
by
way
of
written
brief.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
yes,
sir,
we
do.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
it's
an
alternative
position.
it's
not
inconsistent.
it's
an
alternative.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well,
this
--
this
wilson
--
this
wilson
case
has
--
has
been
a
disturbance
in
the
state
of
louisiana
ever
since
it
was
decided.
and
it
is
purely,
the
wilson
case
is
purely
a
question
of
law.
we
have
here
--
we
are
urging
at
this
particular
time
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
in
accordance
with
the
judgment
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
powell
versus
alabama.
we
can't
prove
anything
or
any
of
the
points
raised
by
powell
versus
alabama
without
bringing
some
of
these
facts
in.
but
we
did
make
them
up
in
the
record.
we've
got
them
in
that
--
in
that
record.
of
course,
the
wilson
case
is
purely
a
--
legal
question.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
in
its
interpretation
of
article
202,
whether
it,
by
virtue
of
that
interpretation
has
to
deny,
not
only
to
this
defendant
but
to
the
defendants
coming
after
him
and
to
subsequent
defendants
coming
after
them,
the
due
process
of
law.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well
all
of
the
testimony
that
was
taken
at
that
particular
time
is
--
is
in
the
record.
i
was
testifying
because
--
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
well
my
point
throughout
the
entire
thing,
i
--
i
say,
assert
in
there
very
definitely
that
i
did
not
consider
myself
to
have
been
appointed
by
the
court
on
march
the
2nd.
i
positively
assert
that
in
there.
and
a
few
other
things
are
--
now
like
this
question
of
who
was
chief
counsel.
now,
that
came
as
a
very
great
surprise
to
me
when
judge
(inaudible)
said
to
mr.
fust
in
due
deference
to
you,
mr.
fust,
i
only
appointed
you
to
assist
mr.
schreiber.
and
mr.
schreiber
was
to
be
the
chief
counsel
that
had
never
come
up
until
that
particular
time.
it
came
as
a
very
great
surprise
to
me.
and
all
of
the
--
the
testimony
that
was
taken,
the
--
the
facts
surrounding
the
appointment
and
so
forth,
it
was
all
perpetuated
because
we
felt
we
would
have
to
commend
that
they
need
to
the
consideration
of
this
court
and
wanted
to
make
up
a
good
record
in
that
respect
because
very
definitely
may
not
positively
assert
that
i
did
not
feel
that
i
had
been
appointed
and
certainly
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
this
chief
counsel's
presence.
does
that
answer
you,
sir?
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
may
i,
your
honor.
mr.
gerard
h.
schreiber
i
knew
what
--
the
record
there
is
that
mr.
fust
and
i
had
no
contact
with
each
other
prior
to
march
the
6th.
i
didn't
know
anything
about
mr.
fust.
mr.
fust
didn't
know
anything
about
me.
the
remand
is
in
the
--
in
the
record.
he
called
me
on
march
the
6th
and
then
told
me
that
he
had
been
appointed
in
the
case
too,
with
me.
and
so,
we
got
together
on
march
the
7th.
but
there
was
no
discussion
made
before
that
who
was
going
to
be
appointed
or
anything
else,
see.
and
this
is
all
borne
out
and
very
specifically
by
the
record.
