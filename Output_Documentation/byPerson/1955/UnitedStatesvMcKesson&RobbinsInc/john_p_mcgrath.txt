mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
it
is
our
position
here
today
that
the
present
status
of
the
fair
trade
controversy
can
fairly
be
said
to
be
that
congress
intends
to
permit
or
condone,
if
you
will,
price
fixing
and
the
elimination
of
price
competition
where
trademark
or
brand
competition
exist
under
certain
circumstances.
the
circumstances
being
that
it
says
to
each
state,
"you
are
at
liberty
to
fix
your
public
policy
on
this
subject."
and
it
says
to
each
manufacturer
of
trend
--
trademark
or
branded
goods,
"you
are
at
liberty
to
fix
your
business
policy
on
this
subject,
namely,
to
impose
price
maintenance
contracts
down
the
stream
of
commerce
or
to
withhold
the
imposition
of
such
price
maintenance
contracts."
now,
regarded
in
that
light
we
have
the
situation
of
mckesson
and
robbins
which,
of
course,
in
addition
to
having
74
wholesale
divisions
where
it
sells
products
manufactured
by
all
the
people
in
the
drug
business,
manufactures
and
markets
through
a
segment
of
its
organization
known
as
--
as
mckesson
laboratories
at
bridgeport,
a
volume
of
--
of
its
own
manufactured
and
branded
products
which
in
the
year
in
question
here,
amounted
to
approximately
$11
million.
and
those
branded
trademark
products
manufactured
by
mckesson
is
price
fixed.
now,
this
chart,
i
have
no
serious
difficulties
with
it,
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
with
regard
to
the
$763,767
shown
as
mckesson
manufacturing
sales
to
independent
wholesalers,
only
283,000,
approximately,
of
that
amount
or
about
one-third
where
to
divisions
or
to
wholesale
dealers
whose
trading
areas
overlapped,
trading
areas
of
mckesson
and
robbins
wholesale
divisions.
the
other
480,000
were
sold
to
wholesale
dealers
whose
trading
areas
did
not
overlap.
with
regard
to
the
$200,000
of
sale,
showing
--
shown
in
the
middle
of
the
chart
between
independent
wholesalers
and
mckesson
wholesale
divisions,
the
testimony
is
that
these
were
courtesy
sales.
in
other
words,
if
wholesaler,
an
independent
wholesaler
needed
a
mckesson
brand
product
in
a
hurry
and
didn't
want
to
get
it
from
bridgeport,
he
could
conveniently
get
it
from
the
nearest
wholesale
division,
he
would
do
it.
but
i
think
the
average
was
$1600
a
year
with
each
of
these.
so
it's
really
a
de
minimis
situation
and
a
courtesy
situation.
now
with
regard
to
this
column
on
the
right
where
one-and-three-tenth
million
are
sold
to
selected
chains,
that
should
be
viewed
with
the
reservation
that
no
challenges
made
to
the
retail
sales
of
mckesson
since
it
does
not
operate
at
the
retail
level.
but
it
also
should
be
born
in
mind
that
the
reason
why
we
abandoned
that
20%
discount,
three
years
after
this
case
was
started,
is
because
no
point
was
made
of
the
fact
that
we
were
making
direct
sales
to
retailers
in
the
complaint
or
at
anytime
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
and
when
the
district
court
said,
"i
reject
the
per
se
doctrine
with
respect
to
fair
trade
price
fixing
and
i
ask
you
to
produce
some
proof
of
an
additional
restraint
other
than
a
restraint
which
exist
from
the
mere
authorization
to
price
fix."
in
other
words,
some
restraint
that
flows
from
the
integrated
nature
of
the
distributive
process
as
performed
by
mckesson,
then
they
seized
upon
this
20%
discount
as
a
differential
in
treatment
by
mckesson
laboratories
to
retailers
from
that
accorded
retailers
by
the
wholesale
divisions
of
mckesson
and
by
independent
wholesalers.
and
they
said
here,
we
point
out,
is
the
additional
restraint
which
judge
murphy
said
would
have
to
be
produced
and
rather
than
confuse
where
up
to
that
point
was
an
issue
of
law
by
this
contention
that
we
were
giving
a
20%
discount
to
retailers
who
bought
direct
certain
quantities
from
mckesson
laboratories,
we
abandoned
the
term,
the
discount
term
because
it
was
meaningless.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
point
we
make
about
--
about
this
20%
discount
is
that
really
a
chain
store
is
a
hybrid
operation.
they
perform
not
only
a
retail
function
but
they
also
perform
at
least
part
of
the
wholesale
function.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
in
one
of
these
walling
cases,
phillips
against
walling,
that
at
times
the
--
there
is
a
--
an
overlapping.
the
court
said
some
agency
must
provide
a
machinery
to
move
all
merchandise
form
the
producer
to
the
retailer.
regardless
of
what
this
function
is
called,
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
wholesale
chain
stores.
once
they
assume
enough
importance
to
justify
a
warehouse
are
engaged
in
wholesaling
as
well
as
retailing.
that's
the
reason
for
the
20%.
the
average
sale,
believe
it
or
not,
from
a
wholesale
--
from
a
wholesale
drug
firm
to
a
drugstore
is
$45.
they
served
on
almost
the
daily
basis
if
not
completely
on
a
daily
basis
by
their
wholesalers.
and
this
20%
discount
applies
only
to
purchasers,
single
orders
of
$1000
or
more.
and
in
the
drug
business,
anybody
who
buys
from
a
wholesale
house
$1000
or
more
is
buying
because
it
is
--
is
able
to
warehouse
and
its
servicing
a
number
of
stores
and
not
merely
one.
so
that
we
think
this
million
--
three
is
out
of
the
case.
and
i
come
now
to
--
to
the
situation
with
respect
to
mckesson
setup
and
the
development
of
this
case.
actually,
the
mckesson
laboratories
is
operated
completely
independently
of
each
one
of
its
wholesale
divisions.
the
personnel
is
different,
top
management,
yes,
the
same.
but
each
one
of
these
mckesson
wholesale
divisions
operates
as
an
independent
wholesale
house.
the
price
fixing
contracts
are
vertical
contracts
in
the
sense
that
they
are
all
--
they
all
have
their
origin
at
the
source
of
the
product
with
the
manufacturer
and
they
are
all
in
a
transaction
of
sale
between
a
buyer
and
a
seller.
there
is
no
horizontal
dealing
between
wholesale
divisions
as
such
and
wholesale
--
independent
wholesalers
that
has
any
relation
to
the
fixing
of
prices.
the
price
is
already
fixed
when
the
product
enters
the
stream
of
commerce
when
it
leaves
the
door
of
the
manufacturer.
and
we
say
that
the
subsequent
relationship
or
the
subsequent
circumstance
that
would
respect
to
other
products,
mckesson
maybe
in
competition
wholesale
with
other
independent
wholesalers
is
irrelevant
and
does
not
relate
back
to
taint
the
validity
of
the
original
transaction.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
believe
so
but
i
can't
answer
that
question
categorically.
they
don't
have
a
--
actually
this
--
the
price,
the
retail
price
is
fixed,
and
everything
is
done
with
reference
to
that
retail
price.
in
other
words,
the
wholesale
price
is
25
off
the
retail
and
then
the
wholesaler
has
the
privilege
of
giving
discounts
depending
upon
quality
purchases
by
retailers,
not
however,
to
exceed
certain
stated
amounts.
10%
and
5%
or
overall
of
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
sir?
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
yes.
off
the
--
off
the
retail
sales
price.
now,
i
had
the
impression
that
when
the
schwegmann
case
was
decided,
it
represented
a
reassertion
by
congress
of
its
approval
of
the
fair
trade
philosophy
when
that
philosophy
met
the
approval
of
the
legislatures
of
the
respective
states.
i
didn't
think
that
it
could
be
successfully
argued
that
the
failure
to
change
certain
language
in
the
reassertion
of
that
philosophy
could
give
any
comfort
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
apparently,
it
has.
this
suit
was
started
before
the
mcguire
act
was
passed.
we
believe
that
when
the
mcguire
act
was
passed,
despite
the
fact
that
it
represented
a
reassertion
of
congressional
approval
in
the
form
that
congress
indicated
that
it
could
be
permitted.
the
department
of
justice
took
the
view
that
if
a
sufficiently
now
interpretation
of
the
language
could
prevail,
that
then,
its
lawsuit
might
survive.
now,
in
order
to
have
the
lawsuit
survive,
of
course,
it
has
become
necessary
for
the
government
to
ask
this
court
to
repudiate
the
exposition
of
congressional
intention
which
was
expressed
by
senator
humphrey.
and
before
we
dismiss
it
as
the
view,
what
he
said
as
the
view
of
a
single
individual
and
not
necessarily
the
collective
view
of
congress
and
not
necessarily
indicating
that
the
president
adopted
it
and
all
the
other
criticism
that
can
be
made,
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
we
should
look
at
what
--
what
was
said
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
said
in
order
to
determine
what
weight
is
to
be
given
to
it.
because
after
all,
that
is
the
question.
what
weight
should
be
given
to
it?
now,
what
senator
humphrey
said,
he
said
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
he
said
it
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
by
senator
sparkman
which
appears
on
page
14
of
our
brief.
senator
sparkman
said,
"mr.
president,
i
should
like
to
ask
the
senator
from
minnesota
one
or
two
questions
in
order
to
be
absolutely
clear
in
my
own
mind
that
in
order
that
the
record
maybe
absolutely
clear.
i
propound
these
questions
to
the
senator
from
minnesota
because
i
know
of
the
great
interest
he
has
in
this
proposed
legislation,
the
work
he
has
done
on
it
and
his
understanding
of
the
facts
and
the
background.
therefore,
i
should
like
to
ask
his
opinion
on
these
two
questions."
now,
as
i
understand
it,
senator
humphrey
led
the
fight
for
this
bill
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.so,
that
it
was
quite
a
logical
thing
for
these
questions
to
be
addressed
to
him.
and
it
is
in
that
context
in
--
in
those
circumstances
that
senator
humphrey
said,
and
i
think
what
he
said
as
it
appears
in
the
middle
of
page
16
where
we've
italicized
it
bears
repetitions.
while
in
one
sense
firms
in
this
position
function
not
only
as
producers
but
also
as
wholesalers
and
retailers,
they
may
still
lawfully
make
contracts
with
other
wholesalers
and
retailers
when
in
making
such
contracts
they
act
as
producers
of
a
trademark
or
branded
commodity
rather
than
as
wholesalers
and
retailer.
and
that
we
submit
is
the
situation
we
have
here.
and
if
this
court
has
in
mind
that
immediately
or
very
shortly
following
that
colloquy,
a
vote
was
taken
on
the
bill
and
the
vote
was
64
in
favor
and
16
senators
against,
i
think,
and
we
have
further
in
mind,
that
not
a
single
senator
took
issue
with
the
views
expressed
by
senator
humphrey
as
to
what
the
bill
was
intended
to
accomplish.
i
think
it's
reasonably
fair
to
say
that
what
senator
humphrey
said
represented
the
intention
of
the
senate.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
think
the
economic
justification
from
my
point
of
view
is
the
fact
that
fair
trading
as
a
philosophy
won
the
argument
in
congress
over
the
outlawing
of
price
fixing
whatever
its
purpose.
i
say
i'm
therefore,
not
called
upon
to
justify
a
--
a
philosophy
which
congress
has
authorized
the
states
to
adopt.
now,
i
think
that's
all
i
have
to
do
here.
i
say
this
that
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
yes,
sir.
and
i
say
that
the
limitation
that
it
put
on
this
doctrine
was
to
prevent
horizontal
price
fixing
by
dealers
at
whatever
functional
level
so
long
as
they
are
at
the
same
functional
level.
and
i
say
that
is
not
what
we
do
here
and
i
invite
examination
of
the
intention
of
congress
and
of
our
action
under
this
statute
by
the
test
whether
any
greater
economic
danger,
any
greater
restraint
of
competition
exist
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
we
are
wholesalers
as
well
as
manufacturers
then
would
exist
if
we
were
not.
and
i
say
that
if
--
i
say
if
mckesson
did
know
wholesale
business
but
was
merely
a
producer,
its
price
fixing
policy
would
eliminate
price
competition
among
all
wholesalers
distributing
its
products,
no
greater
consequence
follows
under
the
present
situation.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
i
don't
see
how
a
manufacturer
could
discriminate
in
fixing
prices
between
two
different
dealers
at
--
at
the
same
level
of
distribution.
and
therefore,
i
would
say
i
couldn't
possibly
give
the
same
answer
and
i
think
the
crux
of
the
situation
lies
in
the
difference
between
the
situation
you
point
out
and
the
one
that
confronts
us.
now,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
attribute
to
congress
an
intention
to
discriminate
against
the
so-called
"integrated
manufacturer"
who
occupies
another
level
by
--
in
a
stream
of
distribution
as
well
as
the
manufacturing
end,
when
no
greater
economic
consequence
flows
from
the
existence
of
such
integration.
and
we
have
a
situation
in
the
doubleday,
doran
case
which
was
before
the
federal
trade
commission
which
presented
another
aspect
of
this
problem,
and
i
think
helps
to
put
it
in
proper
focus.
and
there,
it
was
not
a
question
of
manufacturer
and
wholesaler.
the
integration
there
was
between
a
publisher
of
books,
the
source
of
the
product
and
a
retail
store
maintained
by
the
publisher.
and
it
was
said
--
it
was
contended
that
since
the
publisher
was
in
competition
at
the
retail
level
with
other
retailers
that
therefore,
there
was
a
violation
of
the
mcguire
act
proviso.
and
in
passing
on
that,
the
federal
trade
commission,
which
we
recognized
as
having
some
expert
capacity
in
this
field,
unanimously
rejected
such
a
--
a
proposed
interpretation
of
the
statute.
and
they
said,
"we
can
take
judicial
notice."
this
is
at
page
21
and
22
of
our
brief,
"we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
many
manufacturers
are
partially
integrated
and
engaged
to
a
lesser
or
greater
degree
in
some
form
of
wholesaling
or
retailing
activity."
and
the
fact
is
that
integration
is
a
widespread
practice
in
almost
every
line
of
business
and
it
is
free
throughout
the
united
states.
it
goes
on
to
say,
in
determining
congressional
intent,
there's
a
strong
presumption
that
congress
does
not
act
in
a
vacuum
and
knows
what's
going
on
contemporaneously.
and
he
points
out
that
no
--
no
economic
basis
for
the
interpretation
contended
for
by
the
government
is
--
is
obvious
from
the
facts.
points
out
that
it
would
require
vast
changes
in
the
manufacturing
and
distribution
practices
of
firms
throughout
the
country
if
such
a
construction
would
be
place
upon
it.
and
concludes
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
discriminate
against
partially
integrated
concern.
now,
i
think
that
since
we
have
to
recognize
a
condonation
on
the
part
of
congress
of
the
elimination
of
price
competition,
and
certainly,
the
likelihood
of
the
effect
of
price
fixing
at
the
source
being
--
having
an
impact
at
the
subsequent
levels
of
distribution
was
pointed
out
quite
clearly
in
the
schwegmann
case
by
mr.
justice
douglas
when
he
urged
that
--
that
the
limitation
that
retailers
be
at
least
given
the
privilege
of
voluntary
--
voluntary
agreement
or
acquiescence
in
the
price
fix
before
they
were
bound
by
it.
that
it
seems
to
me
indicate
the
fact
that
congress,
after
the
caveat
contained
in
the
schwegmann
case,
saw
fit
to
reassert
its
approval
of
price
fixing,
both
with
respect
to
signers
of
agreements
and
non-signers
is
an
indication
that
militates
against
the
argument
that
congress
intended
to
discriminate
against
the
partially
integrated
producer.
now,
against
these
arguments,
we
are
confronted
by
the
government
with
the
invocation
of
the
per
se
doctrine.
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument,
they
say
yes
but
price
fixing
is
traditionally
invalid,
illegal
per
se
and
therefore
you
have
the
burden
of
showing
facts
which
take
you
out
of
the
condemnation
contained
in
the
sherman
act.
now,
i
--
i
proceed
to
make
this
argument
with
some
trepidation
but
i
make
it
--
i
confess
with
conviction
also.
i
think
the
per
se
doctrine
is
gone.
that
is
the
traditional
doctrine.
as
i
understand
the
concept,
that
price
fixing
is
inherently
bad
to
use
the
language
in
the
government
brief
or
to
use
other
languages
by
the
government
that
is
conclusively
presumed
to
be
unreasonable.
when
you
say
that
price
fixing
is
illegal
per
se,
you're
using
an
absolute
like
purity
or
perfection
when
soap
as
99%
and
44%
percent
pure,
it's
not
pure.
similarly,
if
price
fixing
is
inherently
illegal,
you
can't
do
it.
you
don't'
as
the
government
suggests
embark
on
an
inquiry
to
determine
--
i
forgot
the
language
--
says,
"in
determining
the
legality
of
any
given
price
fixing
agreement.
well,
you
don't
inquire
to
determine
the
legality
of
a
price
fixing
agreement.
if
it's
illegal
per
se,
you
just
inquire
--
is
it
a
price
fixing
agreement
and
if
it
is,
it's
bad."
now
it's
in
that
sense
that
i
say
that
when
such
a
doctrine
is
invoked,
its
full
power
should
be
appreciated
and
i
doubt
that
the
government
counsel
have
fully
appreciated
the
significance
of
the
concept
to
which
they're
urging.
i
think
they
did
in
certain
language,
at
page
31
of
their
brief,
where
they
take
judge
murphy
to
test
by
saying
it
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
say
as
the
court
did
that
the
per
se
doctrine
is
in
applicable
"absent
a
factual
showing
of
illegality."
the
whole
import,
says
government
counsel,
of
the
per
se
doctrine
is
that
no
such
factual
showing
of
illegality
need
be
made.
well,
i
agree.
if
i
have
the
concept
of
--
of
the
per
se
doctrine
correctly,
i
agree.
but
then
how
do
we
account
for
what
they
say
at
page
27
of
their
brief,
the
bottom,
when
they
say,
"in
short
absent,
a
special
exemption
by
congress,
price
fixing
agreements
in
or
affecting
interstate
commerce
are
not
only
illegal
but
illegal
per
se."
it
seems
to
me
they
commit
the
same
offense
for
which
they
take
judge
murphy
to
test.
i
say
that
if
there
is
anything
left
of
the
per
se
doctrine,
it's
a
water
down
version
and
it
isn't
the
inherent
illegality,
the
--
the
very
essence
of
wrong
and
taint
which
cannot
be
rationalized
into
something
right.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
i
think
the
bill
that
created
the
exemption
killed
the
doctrine.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
the
miller-tydings
act
put
an
end
to
the
per
se
doctrine
because
it
said
it's
--
it's
no
longer
wrong
if
the
state
--
they
delegated
to
the
states
the
right
to
say
it
was
right.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
you
don't
inquire.
as
i
understand
the
concept
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
as
i
understand
the
concept,
you
can't
inquire
the
circumstances.
now,
in
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
you're
dealing
with
an
absolute.
the
fact
that
there
are
circumstances
it's
all
right,
other
circumstances
not
all
right
rebuts
the
notion
of
--
of
absolute
wrong.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
i
think
the
problem
that
we
have
here
and
i
--
i
see
no
point
in
laboring
the
doctrine
of
per
se
or
not
per
se
where
not
for
the
fact
that
the
--
as
i
see
the
government's
position
an
attempt
is
being
made
here
to
convert,
what
started
as
a
conclusive
presumption
of
illegality
into
a
rule
of
evidence
by
which
the
government
can
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
us
by
saying
we
now
have
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
i
say
per
se
illegality
and
exception
can't
coexist.
and
i
say
that
if
there's
a
conclusive
presumption
of
illegality
and
congress
removes
that
by
statutory
mandate,
the
government
has
no
right
to
say
that
upon
the
ashes
of
that
conclusive
presumption
they
can
write
a
rebuttable
presumption
so
as
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof
to
us
to
justify
what
we
are
doing
when
--
when
congress
said
what
we're
doing
is
alright.
but
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
i
hope
i'm
not
arguing
with
anybody
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
i
think
so,
but
i
think
that
the
government
counsel
has
introduced
the
question
of
burden
of
proof
here.
at
--
at
the
top
of
page
25
of
the
government
brief,
they
mentioned
that
their
position
is
set
forth
in
terms
of
two
basic
propositions,
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
24.
one,
that
the
agreements
are
illegal
per
se
unless
exempt
under
the
miller-tydings
and
mcguire
acts,
another
at
page
25,
they
say
the
first
relates
to
the
government's
burden
of
proof.
now,
i
say
that
when
--
when
you
talk
about
illegal
per
se
unless
exempt,
you're
talking
about
contradiction
of
terms,
number
one,
and
i
say
i
won't
stand
for
the
government
employee
shifting.
it's
burden
of
proof
onto
me
by
saying
that
they
have
the
right
to
arrive
on
the
curtails
of
a
doctrine
that
no
longer
exist
and
say
that
we're
doing
something
wrong.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
is
that
the
(inaudible)
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
i
say
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
i
say
that
it's
entirely
possible
that
--
that
a
horizontal
contract
between
two
wholesalers
neither
of
whom
is
a
producer
could
be
a
violation
but
i
say
that
--
that
when
the
price
fixing
occurs
at
the
manufacturing
level,
the
mere
fact
that
the
--
the
--
there
maybe
a
wholesale
activity
of
the
manufacturer
does
not
vitiate
a
price
fixing
agreement
to
which
was
between
buyer
and
seller
was
vertical
and
perfectly
and
perfectly
legal.
actually,
judge
murphy
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
actually
the
competition
occurs
at
a
later
stage
in
the
stream
of
commerce
after
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
i
--
i'd
like
to
test
it
this
way.
i
don't
say
that
it's
impossible
for
the
government
to
make
out
a
case
against
the
manufacturer
who's
also
a
wholesaler.
and
perhaps
that
illustrates
the
point
that
i've
been
trying
to
make.
it
maybe
conceivable
that
practices
may
develop
which
one
factually
proven
frustrate
the
intention
of
congress
as
expressed
in
this
statute
and
upon
the
introduction
of
--
of
proper
proof
indicating
that,
a
case
would
be
made
out
of
violation.
but
i
say
we're
not
violating
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
--
to
demonstrate
that
we're
doing
something
more
than
we
would
be
doing
if
weren't
in
the
wholesale
business
at
all.
that
puts
our
finger
right
on
the
--
on
the
crux
of
the
argument.
i
don't
think
we're
required
to
say
here
that
the
wholesalers,
that
no
activity
between
us
and
independent
wholesalers
could
be
--
could
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
i
think
it's
possible
that
there
could
be
violation
by
--
by
some
illicit
agreement
between
the
wholesalers
which
might
relate
back
to
control
the
action
of
the
manufacturer
upon
proof
of
such
a
situation,
there
would
be
a
violation.
but
judge
murphy
said,
"you
can't
rely
on
the
rule
of
evidence
but
you
have
to
come
forward
and
show
additional
proof
of
restraint."
some
restraints
which
exist
above
and
beyond
that
which
is
inherent
in
the
price
fixing
which
congress
says,
is
proper.
we
say,
we
concur
in
that.
the
government
has
not
come
forward
with
any
proof
of
any
such
abuse,
and
for
that
reason,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
i
agree
that
if
the
statute
is
read
and
construed,
as
senator
humphrey
said
it
was
intended,
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
case
and
i
would
be
perfectly
content
to
stop
there
where
not
for
the
point
that
is
made
by
the
government
with
respect
to
the
invocation
of
this
per
se
doctrine
as
a
rule
of
evidence.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
the
--
the
other
sales
are
made
by
the
wholesale
divisions
of
mckesson
which
there
were
74
of
those
throughout
the
united
states
setup
geographically
by
area.
the
mckesson
manufacturing
division
is
just
one
out
setup
on
bridgeport
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
sir?
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
that's
right.
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
well,
there's
(voice
overlap)
there's
an
organizational
difference
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
but
actually
--
mr.
john
p.
mcgrath
i
--
i
know
of
no
economic
difference.
no,
sir.
the
mckesson
wholesale
divisions
are
just
as
much
bound
by
the
price
fixed
originating
at
the
manufacturing
level
as
the
independent
wholesalers
are.
i
think
that
concludes
my
argument.
