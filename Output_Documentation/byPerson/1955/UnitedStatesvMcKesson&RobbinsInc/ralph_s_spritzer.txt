mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
we
have
in
this
case
a
question
whether
certain
prize
fixing
agreements,
more
specifically,
certain
agreements
providing
for
resale
prize
maintenance
are
exempted
from
the
normal
operation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
question
is
a
narrow
statutory
one.
it
turns
on
the
language
of
the
miller-tydings
act
and
of
the
subsequent
mcguire
act.
stated
in
what
have
become
popular
terms,
the
question
is
whether
the
particular
agreements
which
the
government
sought
to
enjoin
here
for
within
the
so-called
"fair
trade"
exemption.
let
me
invite
to
the
court's
attention
early,
the
specific
words
with
which
we
are
here
concern.
and
i
might
say
preliminary
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
words
are
the
same
in
the
miller-tydings
act
of
1937
and
in
the
mcguire
act
of
1952.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
came
up
after
trial.
actually,
it
was
a
very
limited
trial
in
which
the
parties
relied
primarily
on
documents
and
on
certain
depositions.
the
government
had
previously
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
theory
that
on
the
admitted
facts
or
undisputed
facts
this
could
be
enjoined.
that
motion
was
denied.
subsequently,
it
went
to
trial
at
which
time
the
government
stood
basically
on
its
position
that
the
district
judge
had
urged
in
denying
the
motion
for
summary
judgement
though
it
did
as
i
point
out
later,
suggest
that
it
had
something
further
provide
on.
now,
your
honors,
of
course,
recall
the
federal
fare
trade
legislation,
to
use
that
term,
permits,
broadly
speaking,
resale
price
maintenance
in
respect
of
branded
or
trademark
goods
which
have
competition
from
other
goods
of
the
same
general
character
that
permission
from
federal
law
being
conditioned
upon
the
particular
agreement
being
legal
under
relevant
state
law.
but
this
authorization,
this
immunity
from
the
effect
of
the
sherman
act
is
explicitly
limited
by
a
rather
pointed
proviso
which
is
the
center
of
controversy
in
this
case.
and
that
proviso
paragraph
is
setout
among
other
places
in
the
government's
opening
brief
at
page
38.
it
begins
by
stating
in
substance
that
nothing
in
the
exemption
statute
shall
make
lawful.
and
then,
i
will
quote
the
exact
words
which
we
have
italicized
there
on
printed
page.
"nothing
contained
in
the
paragraph
shall
make
lawful
agreements."
now,
i'm
quoting,
"between
manufactures
or
between
producers
or
between
wholesalers,"
and
that
phrase
particular
important
in
this
case
and
then
going
on,
"or
between
brokers
or
between
factors
or
between
retailers
or
--
and
again
we
emphasize
specially,
between
persons,
firms
or
corporations
in
competition
with
each
other."
now,
that
language,
as
the
court
will
note
by
granting
further
down
the
page
is
identical
for
all
practical
purposes
with
the
language
of
the
proviso
in
miller-tydings.
now,
with
that
proviso
in
mind,
let
me
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
but
in
this
respect,
there
was
no
change.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
proviso
is
identical.
as
your
honor
will
see
on
page
39,
we
go
on
and
quote
from
miller-tydings
and
your
honor
will
find
the
same
proviso,
"noting
shall
make
lawful
agreements
between
wholesalers
or
between
persons,
firms
or
corporations
in
competition
with
each
other.
this
was
not
something
which
congress
chose
to
change
when
it
passed
the
mcguire
act.
and
if
i
may
anticipate,
the
little
in
argument
i
will
make
later,
that's,
perhaps,
the
particular
significance
because
this
suit
was
brought
and
publically
announced
before
the
mcguire
act
was
passed
and
congress
was
told
about
a
tendency
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
antitrust
when
he
testified
in
relation
with
the
mcguire
act.
but
that
--
that
is
running
ahead
of
my
story,
i
would
like
to
pause.
now
that
we
have
the
proviso
in
mind
and
before
the
court
to
indicate
just
what
mckesson's
operations
are
and
what
particular
contracts
are
involved
in
this
suit
under
the
sherman
act.
we've
request
the
distribution
to
the
court
of
a
--
of
a
diagram,
that
i
see
your
honors
have.
this
is
something
we
prepared,
it's
not
in
the
nature
of
anything
of
record,
and
it's
purely
to
illustrate
the
facts
as
we
understand
them
and
i
think
they're
not
substantially
in
dispute.
now,
mckesson
is
a
manufacturer
of
drugs.
it
is
also
a
wholesaler
of
drugs.
it
has
various
divisions
but
it's
one
corporation
with
one
president,
one
chairman,
one
management.
the
wholesale
divisions
and
actually
there
are
some
70
odd
such
divisions
operate
in
various
sections
of
the
country,
mckesson
doing
a
virtually
nationwide
business.
the
wholesale
divisions
handle
mckesson
brand
products
which
are
prepared
or
package
by
the
manufacturing
division
and
they
also
handle
the
products
of
other
drug
manufacturers.
indeed
the
volume
of
products
of
other
drug
manufactures
handled
by
the
wholesale
division
far
exceeds
the
volume
of
the
mckesson
brand
products.
mckesson,
in
other
words,
is
in
the
general
drug
wholesaling
business
and
is,
indeed,
the
largest
wholesaler
of
drugs
in
the
united
states.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
and
as
i
say,
their
own
brand
products
are
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
total
handle.
but
we
are
concern
in
this
case
only
with
mckesson's
own
branded
products
and
hence
for
purposes
of
this
litigation,
the
other
products
can
be
put
completely
to
one
side.
now,
let
me
indicate
briefly
on
this
diagram,
the
distribution
channel
so
far
as
mckesson
brand
products
are
concerned.
largest
part
of
that
merchandise
--
those
as
indicated
by
the
arrow
in
the
center
of
the
page
going
downward,
the
largest
part
of
mckesson
brand
products
go
--
goes
from
the
manufacturing
division
to
the
mckesson
wholesale
divisions
which
in
turn,
of
course,
resales
to
the
retail
trade.
now,
another
segment,
another
portion
of
that
merchandise
shown
by
the
arrow
appearing
on
the
righthand
side
of
the
diagram
is
distributed
directly
by
mckesson
manufacturing
division
to
the
retail
trade.
those
sales
have
been
made
by
mckesson's
to
selected
desirable
attempt,
largely
or
exclusively,
i
think,
the
large
drug
chains
such
as
walgreens
or
peoples.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
we
are
contending
and
i'll
come
to
that,
your
honor,
in
a
moment.
that
mckesson's
agreements
with
the
independent
wholesalers
violate
this
proviso.
that
brings
me
to
the
third
channel
of
distribution
which
i
hadn't
yet
stated.
it's
represented
by
the
arrow
that
appears
on
the
lefthand
side
of
the
page.
that's
the
third
channel,
sales
by
mckesson's
manufacturing
division
to
independent
wholesalers
who
in
turn
sell
these
mckesson
brand
products
to
the
retail
drug
trade.
there
is
an
arrow
moving
from
right
to
left
in
the
center
of
the
page
which
shows
only
that
the
independent
wholesalers
buy
some
of
the
mckesson
brand
products
from
mckesson
wholesale
division
operating
in
the
field.
so,
they
buy
most
of
them
from
the
manufacturing
division
which
is
in
connecticut.
now,
the
independent
wholesalers
compete
with
mckesson
in
selling
drugs
to
the
retail
trade.
there's
no
question
about
that.
it
was
agreed
by
representatives
of
mckesson
who
testified
on
deposition.
it
reflected
in
stipulations
which
are
of
record
and
the
court
below
so
found.
it
appears
that
some
of
the
independent
wholesalers
have
trade
territories
which
are
virtually
identical
with
trade
territories
served
by
individual
wholesale
divisions
of
mckesson.
as
to
others,
it
appears
that
there's
substantial
overlapping
and
even
as
to
those
independent
wholesalers
who
do
not
compete
with
mckesson
wholesale
division
in
selling
to
the
retail
trade.
there
is
still
competition
with
mckesson
because
those
independent
wholesalers
do
compete
with
mckesson's
manufacturing
division
in
seeking
the
patronage
of
these
large
retail
drug
chains.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
they
--
they
both
sell
in
the
same
retail
trade.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
that
represents
the
whole
market
and
not
any
particular
fragmentation
of
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
how
real
that
competition
would
be,
one
might,
of
course,
question
since
normally
to
operating
divisions
of
the
same
company.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
our
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
at
all
about
the
legality
of
agreements
with
retails.
we
don't
question
that,
we
never
challenge
to.
it's
not
an
issue
under
the
complaint.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
the
only
question
is
whether
mckesson
can
fix
the
prices
at
which
the
wholesale
competitors
of
mckesson
may
sell
mckesson
brand
products.
and
we
say
that
they
cannot
because
by
definition,
mckesson's
agreement
with
the
independent
wholesalers
is
an
agreement
between
wholesalers
and
if
there
any
question
as
to
that,
it's
certainly
clear
that
it's
an
agreement
between
persons,
firms
or
corporations
in
competition
with
one
another.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
provided
mckesson
itself
was
not
doing
business
in
competition
with
those
independent
wholesalers.
in
other
words,
we
have
no
objection
to
the
proposition
that
a
manufacturer
may
bind
wholesalers
under
miller-tydings
and
mcguire.of
course,
he
can
just
as
he
combine
retailers
or
--
or
anybody
else
in
the
line
of
distribution.
the
question
is,
whether
he
is
given
that
permission
by
the
federal
act
when
in
some
capacity
or
other,
he
is
engaged
in
competition
with
the
very
persons
whom
he
would
bind
by
contract.
and
if
this
proviso
clause
is
to
be
given
the
plain
effect
of
the
words,
it
would
seem
that
no
such
agreement
is
immune
from
the
sherman
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
they
do.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
not
involved
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
the
government
didn't
alleged
that
there
was
any
consort
of
action
between
mckesson
and
independent
wholesalers
in
respect
of
product
of
other
manufacturers.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
may
be
that
many
of
those
other
drug
manufacturers
do
fair
trade
but
that
of
course
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
problem
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
with
the
other
drug
manufacturers?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
none
that
appears
--
none
charge,
none
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
as
i
think
i've
already
indicated,
perhaps,
without
saying
so
explicitly.
mckesson
has
fair
trade
contracts
with
each
and
every
one
of
the
90
odd
independent
wholesalers
who
handle
mckesson
drugs.
and
if
those
contracts
and
those
along
which
are
challenged
by
this
suit
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
that
--
that
bring,
it
may
do.
the
point
i
just
wish
to
call
up
your
honors
attention
in
stating
the
facts.
we've
shown
also
on
the
chart
the
discounts
which
are
permitted
or
given,
as
the
case
maybe,
under
the
arrangements
which
mckesson
had
when
this
suit
was
brought.
as
your
honors
will
notice
the
independent
wholesalers
could
buy
from
mckesson's
manufacturing
division
at
25%
off
the
list,
and
list
as
here
use
means
mckesson's
wholesale
list.
then
when
they
sold
in
turn
to
the
drug
retailers,
they
were
required
to
charge
a
minimum
price
which
was
no
less
than
14.5%
off
list.
now,
if
you'll
compare,
you
will
see
on
the
right
side
of
the
diagram
that
mckesson's
manufacturing
division,
when
it
sold
to
these
selected
large
chains
gave
on
quantity
purchases
up
to
20%
off
list
as
contrasted
with
the
14.5%
which
the
independents
could
get.
that
was
the
maximum,
the
independent
to
give
in
those
circumstances
could
they
give
anymore
no
matter
how
big
the
order.
i
should
add
in
fairness
to
appellee
here
that
on
the
eve
of
trial
in
march
1955,
some
three
years
after
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
brought.
mckesson
did
abandon
this
last
mentioned
practice
and
said
that
henceforth,
the
independent
wholesalers
could
give
equivalent
discounts
on
equivalent
quantity.
but
apart
from
that
question
as
to
whether
mckesson
was
undercutting
the
prices
which
it
established
for
its
competitors,
we
say
that
we
have
here
a
pure
legal
issue.
we
say
that
we
thank
these
words
say
without
any
qualification
and
as
pointedly
as
they
can,
that
nothing
in
federal
fair
trade
legislation
shall
make
lawful
resale
price
maintenance
agreements
between
wholesalers
or
between
persons,
firms
or
corporations
in
competition
with
each
other.
and
mckesson's
a
wholesaler.
it's
the
largest
in
the
country.
the
independent
wholesalers
are
also,
by
definition,
wholesalers.
and
apart
from
that,
there's
no
dispute
that
the
independents
do
compete
with
mckesson
with
both
of
its
manufacturing
and
its
wholesale
divisions
in
selling
mckesson
brand
products
to
the
retail
trade.
now,
it
was
on
that
basis,
deeming
it
clear,
that
these
agreements
were
not
within
the
exemption
of
the
mcguire
act,
that
the
government
moved
for
summary
judgment
in
the
district
court.
that
was
in
the
southern
district
and
that
motion
was
denied
by
judge
murphy
who
wrote
in
extended
opinion.
i
think
the
gist
of
that
opinion
maybe
conveyed
by
this
single
sentence
which
i
will
quote
from
it.
it
appears
in
the
record
of
21.
judge
murphy
said,
"this
court
is
unwilling
at
this
stage
of
case
law
development
of
legislatively
sanctioned
resale
price
fixing
to
hold
illegal
per
se
fair
trade
agreements
because
the
producer
is
also
a
wholesaler
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
some
injury
inchoate
or
consummate
to
competition."
many
said
further
on
the
following
page
that
he
would
not
apply
the
doctrine
that
price
fixing
is
per
se
illegal
absent
a
factual
showing
of
illegality.
then
on
that
basis,
he
said
that
the
case
should
go
to
trial.
he
also
stated
that
if
it
appeared,
for
example,
that
mckesson's
agreements
with
the
independent
wholesalers
were
--
and
again
i'm
quoting
from
the
opinion,
this
time
from
record
23,
"if
it
appeared
that
the
agreements
were
a
first
step
toward
and
with
the
intent
to
gauge
consumers,
that
might
suffice
prima
facie
as
violation
of
the
sherman
act
outside
the
privilege
of
the
fair
trade
statutes."
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
he
took
it
and
i
think
erroneously
that
the
per
se
doctrine
didn't
apply
to
--
to
resale
price
maintenance
agreements
any
longer.
he
thought
that
since
congress
has
dealt
with
the
subject
of
resale
price
maintenance
that
such
agreements
had
to
be
considered
in
each
case
on
their
facts
to
find
out
if
there
was
some
additional
restraint
as
he
put
it.
indeed,
the
--
the
first
sentence
which
i
quoted
earlier,
i
think,
is
the
clearest
reflection
of
that
(voice
overlap)
on
record
21.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
exactly.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
--
that's
our
full
argument
on
that
branch
of
the
case.
i'm
not
going
to
attempt
to
detail
the
cases
here
in
which
this
court
has
for
40
or
more
years
said
that
price
fixing
agreements
are
per
se
illegal
and
in
which
it
is
held
that
particularly
in
relation
to
resale
price
maintenance
agreements.
those
cases
extend
from
the
dr.
miles
decision
in
1911,
certainly
down
through
the
schwegmann
case.
and
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
nothing
is
per
se
in
the
field
of
resale
price
maintenance.
now,
we
think
it's
perfectly
plain
from
cases
like
the
(inaudible)
case
and
the
schwegmann
case,
other
cases
which
post
date
their
trade
legislation.
but
the
question
is
whether
you're
within
the
exemption
or
whether
you're
outside
of
it.
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
changed
preexisting
law
in
respect
of
agreements
which
are
outside
the
exemption.
and
from
that
view,
i
may
say,
i
don't
think
there's
ever
been
any
dissent
by
any
single
justice
of
this
court.
now,
mckesson
does
not,
as
i
have
read
their
brief,
rely
on
judge
murphy's
position
in
this
court.
they
have
somewhat
different
argument
to
which
i'll
come
in
a
moment.
but
before
i
do,
perhaps
i
should
say
a
word
about
what
occurred
at
the
trial.
after
summary
judgment
was
denied
--
was
denied,
the
matter
went
to
trial
before
judge
clancy.
the
government
had
taken
depositions
of
two
officers
of
mckesson
and
they're
also
on
file
in
connection
with
the
papers
filed
in
support
and
in
opposition
to
the
motions
for
summary
judgment,
various
interrogatories
and
answers
and
various
stipulations.
no
oral
testimony
was
taken.
the
government
reasserted
its
position
that
these
agreements
were
per
se
illegal
on
the
admitted
facts.
it
also
made
the
argument
that
if
some
peculiar
injury
to
competition
had
to
be
shown
beyond
that
which
is
presumed
to
result
from
price
fixing
generally,
there
was
a
showing
of
such
additional
injury
or
restraint
in
as
much
as
it
appeared
that
mckesson
had
undercut
in
dealing
with
the
large
drug
chains,
the
prices
which
it
had
bound
the
independent
wholesalers
to
charge
in
dealing
with
the
same
trade.
now,
judge
clancy
rejected
the
government's
legal
theory,
expressed
his
agreement
with
judge
murphy
stating
incidentally
that
he
thought
that
judge
murphy
had
established
the
law
of
the
case
and
then
he
found
insufficient
to
show,
as
he
put
it
additional
restraint,
this
factor
of
undercutting
which
i
have
just
mentioned.
now,
as
i
indicated
a
moment
ago,
i
think,
mckesson's
position
in
this
court
is
somewhat
different
from
judge
murphy's
reasoning
in
denying
summary
judgment.
as
i
understand
its
brief,
it
doesn't
argue
that
the
per
se
rule
is
now
inapplicable
to
resale
price
maintenance
as
such.
what
it
does
argue
is
that
it
is
within
the
statutory
exemption.
it
says
that
the
words
or
rather
the
prohibition
on
agreements
between
wholesalers
is
not
to
be
applied
when
the
wholesaler
is
also
a
manufacturer.
it
says
in
other
words,
“we
sell
to
the
independent
wholesalers
in
our
manufacturing
capacity.”
therefore,
the
court
should
not
consider
our
fair
trade
contracts
with
the
independent
wholesalers
as
constituting
agreements
between
wholesalers.
it
also
argues,
and
i
think
this
is
essentially
the
same
argument
differently
expressed,
that
the
proviso
should
not
be
applied
where
there
is
a
buyer-seller
relationship
as
between
the
parties
to
the
agreement,
which
is
really
tantamount
to
saying,
we
think,
the
proviso
should
not
be
applied
to
resale
price
maintenance
as
ordinarily
conceived.
now,
we
think,
there
are
number
of
objections
to
this
theory
or
suggestion
that
mckesson
may,
for
purposes
of
application
of
the
statute
change
its
character
or
identity
at
will.
in
the
first
place,
congress
did
not
add
after
the
phrase
between
wholesalers,
the
words
which
mckesson
would
interpolate,
i.e.
unless
one
of
the
parties
is
also
a
manufacturer.
moreover,
mckesson
did
not
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
my
argument
would
be
the
same.
now,
mckesson,
moreover,
did
not
cease
to
be
a
wholesaler
merely
because
the
fair
trade
contracts
which
he
executed
with
independent
wholesalers
were
signed
by
an
officer
in
the
manufacturing
division
rather
than
in
the
wholesaling
division.
the
fact
remains
that
it
competes
with
these
people
and
competes
with
them
in
its
capacity
as
wholesalers.
i
should
also
mention,
i
think,
that
even
we
go
along
with
the
suggestion
that
you
can
somehow
divorce
the
manufacturing
and
wholesaling
operations
here,
the
fact
remains
that
both
its
manufacturing
division
and
its
wholesaling
division
sell
to
the
retail
trade
and
they
both
compete
with
the
independent
wholesalers.
so,
whatever
possible
question
one
might
have,
and
we
hardly
think
it
would
be
a
serious
one
as
to
the
application
of
the
between
wholesalers
phrase,
we
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
real
question
as
to
the
application
of
the
final
phrase
in
the
proviso
paragraph
between
persons,
firms
or
corporations
in
competition
with
each
other.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
sir.
they
are
operating
divisions
of
the
same
corporation
which
has
a
unified
management.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
or
concede
that
the
case
would
necessarily
be
different
if
it
were
--
if
they
were
subsidiary
corporations
but
they're
not.
mckesson
also
claims
support
for
the
view
that
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
preclude
the
dual
manufacturer,
that
is
the
manufacturer
who
operates
also
as
a
wholesaler,
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
preclude
it
from
using
fair
trade,
claims
support
for
that
in
legislative
history.
now,
before
turning,
as
i
will
very
briefly,
in
a
moment
to
the
committee
reports
and
the
debates,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
background
facts
which
we
think
are
key
importance
if
there's
any
necessity
at
all
in
this
case
of
looking
the
legislative
history.
the
first
is,
that
all
of
the
states
which
have
fair
trade
laws,
have
in
those
laws
phrases
similar
to
what
appears
in
this
proviso
paragraph.
all
of
them
state,
that
agreements
between
wholesalers,
between
producers,
between
retailers
are
not
permitted.
there's
some
--
there
are
some
variations
in
language.
some
say
between
wholesalers,
others
between,
and
among,
and
so
on.
but
they
all
have
comparable
language.
the
federal
act
took
over
that
language
and
it
added
the
further
final
phrase
or
between
persons,
firms,
or
corporations
in
competition
with
each
other.
now,
that
last
phrase
was
added,
as
senator
tydings
stated,
was
added
to
the
miller-tydings
bill
at
the
suggestion
of
the
attorney
general
to
remove
certain
objections
which
he
had
and
for
purposes
of
clarity.
but
the
point
i
would
emphasize
particularly
here,
is
that
we
don't
have,
in
this
case,
a
situation
like
--
well,
a
situation
where
it
can
be
argued
as
it
was
in
the
schwegmann
case.
that
the
federal
act
needs
to
be
broadly
interpreted
in
order
to
give
play
to
the
basic
scheme
of
the
state
laws,
because
the
fact
here
is,
that
all
of
the
state
laws
have
comparable
language
and
have
had
since
their
inception.
now,
there's
a
second
point
which
stands
out
from
the
standpoint
of
history.i've
already
alluded
to
it.
and
that
is
that
the
present
suit
was
filed
in
1951
and
it
was
publicly
announced
by
the
attorney
general
at
that
time.
it
was
filed,
that
is
to
say,
after
miller-tydings
and
before
mcguire.
and
as
i've
also
indicated
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
antirust
called
the
attention
of
this
suit
to
the
congressional
committee
in
the
course
of
his
testimony
which
dealt
with
many
faces
of
the
mcguire
act.
now,
the
committee
didn't
comment
on
that,
didn't
comment
on
this
suit
and
we
don't
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
that
i
--
that
the
context
clearly
shows
that.
he
was
talking
about
many
aspects
of
fair
trade
and
he
did
in
the
course
of
his
testimony
and
we've
given
the
full
references
to
the
court
in
our
brief,
refer
to
this
suit
and
indicate
its
nature.
now,
i'm
not
attempting
to
put
more
weight
on
that
than
it
can
bear.
i
don't
say
that
congress
said
we
approved.
it's
a
fine
thing
you
brought
a
suit.
it
didn't.
it
didn't
make
any
comment
one
way
or
the
other
in
the
committee
report.
now,
all
we're
saying
is
that
congress
was
on
notice
and
that
this
was
one
aspect
of
the
miller-tydings
act
that
it
didn't
choose
to
change.
we've
discussed
in
our
brief
at
some
length
the
committee
reports
and
the
debate
on
miller-tydings
and
the
mcguire
act,
i
only
attempt
to
indicate
very
briefly
here
of
what
we
think
is
shown.
the
proviso
paragraph
wasn't
added
to
miller-tydings
until
the
bill
reached
the
floor.
and
probably,
as
a
result
of
that,
there
was
very
little
comment
in
the
committee
report.
in
any
event
all
that
the
committee
report
say
is
that
--
well,
it
paraphrased
the
proviso
and
then
add
the
comment
that
horizontal
contracts
are
not
authorized.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
had
the
comment
that
horizontal
agreements
are
not
authorized.
judge
murphy
summarized
the
legislative
history
in
his
opinion.
he
said
he
found
it
wholly
unilluminating.
he
stated,
and
we
think
quite
correctly
on
this
point,
that
the
committee
reports
have
language,
such
that
i've
just
indicated,
reflecting
a
general
disapproval
of
agreements
between
competitors,
but
they
do
not
have
anything
concretely
discussing
the
situation
in
which
the
dual
entrepreneurs,
that
is
the
company
like
mckesson
finds
it
here.
now,
mckesson
doesn't
find
anything
either
to
support
its
position
in
the
committee
reports.
hasn't
cited
anything.
in
them
in,
we
don't
think
there
is
anything.
it
relies
rather
on
statements
of
two
individual
legislators.
one
statement
made
when
miller-tydings
was
before
congress
and
another
statement
made
when
the
mcguire
act
was
before
congress.
the
first
of
these
doesn't,
in
our
view,
support
mckesson's
position
at
all.
the
second
is
entirely
favorable
to
mckesson's
position
but
it
represents,
we
submit,
nothing
more
than
the
views
of
one
legislator,
not
concurred
in
or
disagreed
with
for
that
matter
by
any
other
legislator
who
had
no
official
connection
with
the
bill.
let
me
turn
first,
however,
to
the
first
statement.
we
set
that
forth
in
the
government's
brief
in
a
long
footnote
appearing
at
pages
59
and
60.
the
first
sentence
of
that
statement,
and
it's
a
statement
by
representative
mclaughlin
who
was
a
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee.
the
first
sentence
is
a
paraphrase
of
the
proviso.
and
then
on
page
60,
there
is
the
italicized
language
upon
which
mckesson
relies.
representative
mclaughlin
said,
"as
an
example,
the
act
would
not
allow
two
manufacturers
of
similar
trademark
articles"
--
as
for
instance
and
i'll
skip
some
of
that,
"to
agree
between
themselves
as
to
the
prize
at
which
their
respective
article
shall
be
sold."
now,
we
have
no
disagreement
with
that
statement.
we
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
proviso
clause
would
forbid
two
manufacturers,
let
us
say,
of
different
branded
items,
the
manufacture
of
calox
tooth
powder
and
dr.
lyons
tooth
powder
from
getting
together
in
saying
that
each
of
them
would
follow
a
certain
price
fixing
program
in
relation
to
the
product
of
each.
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that,
that
the
proviso
has
no
application
to
agreements
by
two
manufacturers
or
two
wholesalers
in
relation
to
a
single
trademark
commodity.
indeed,
representative
mclaughlin
said
at
the
outset
of
that
sentence
as
an
example.
now,
turning
to
the
second
statement
upon
which
mckesson
relies,
and
this
one
is
relevant
though
we
don't
thinks
authoritative.
that
set
forth
at
pages
66
and
67
of
the
government's
brief.
it's
a
statement
by
senator
humphrey.
it
was
made
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
during
the
debates
on
the
mcguire
bill.
and
he
quite
specifically
mentioned
the
case
of
a
producer
who
sells
to
consumers,
retailers
and
wholesalers
alike.
excuse
me.
not
only
did
he
mention
the
case
but
he
went
on
to
say,
"such
firms
may
make
resale
price
maintenance
contracts,"
i'm
now
quoting
him,
"with
both
wholesalers
and
retailers."
well
it's
perfectly
plain
that
senator
humphrey
didn't
think
that
the
between
wholesalers
phrase
ought
to
be
applied
to
a
wholesaler
who
is
also
a
manufacturer.
we
note
that
he
did
not
discuss
how
one
reads
that
of
the
statute,
the
other
phrase
which
we
think
important
between
persons,
firms,
and
corporations
in
competition
with
one
another.
but
in
any
event,
we
submit,
that
this
is
a
statement
which
can
hardly
overcome
the
express
language
of
the
statute.
senator
humphrey
was
not
a
--
an
author
of
miller-tydings
or
of
mcguire.
he
was
not
a
member
of
any
committee
which
considered
either
of
those
bills.
there's
no
indication
as
to
whether
anybody
else
in
the
senate
or
in
the
house
agreed
with
senator
humphrey's
position
that
the
attorney
general's
suit
against
mckesson
was
unjustified
and
we
hardly
think
in
the
circumstances
that
such
a
statement
coming
from
an
individual
legislator
can
have
great
weight.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
because
senator
sparkman's
participation
was
passive
rather
than
active
in
this
at
the
time
of
this
discussion.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
really
recall
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
this
bill
was
originated
in
the
house
and
it
was
taken
over
by
the
senate.
so,
no
one
in
the
senate
was
in
any
sense
an
author
of
this
bill,
whether
senator
sparkman
was
at
that
time
a
member
of
the
judiciary
committee
(voice
overlap)
i
couldn't
tell
you
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
there
are
no
basis.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
was
not
in
charge
with
the
bill
at
that
time.
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
committee,
i
--
don't
recall
but
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
while
a
question
more
generally
in
nature,
he
listed
at
this
comment
by
senator
humphrey
that
it
seems
clear
enough
that
senator
sparkman
didn't
affirm
it
or
disaffirm
it
after
the
statement
was
made.
our
position
in
short
on
the
legislative
history
is
that
there
is
nothing
authoritative
and
that
the
language
here
which
is
clear
can
hardly
be
disregarded
especially
since
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
familiar
canon
that
exemption
provisions
are
not
to
be
extended
beyond
their
plain
terms
is
clearly
applicable.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
like
to
address
myself
brief
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
raised
as
to
the
possible
economic
objections
which
congress
might
have
which
reasonable
men
might
have
to
price
fixing
between
competitors
which
would
perhaps
not
be
applicable
in
equal
degree
to
other
types
of
resale
price
maintenance
agreements.
before
doing
that,
however,
i
would
say
that
we
do
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
actually
need
not
go
beyond
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
either
to
legislative
history
or
to
speculation
about
economic
policy.
because
it
is
an
exemption
provision
and
these
are
words
which
are
as
plain
as
words
can
be
persons
in
competition
with
one
another
and
we
have
confession
that
they
compete.
but
if
one
does
go
to
this
question
of
economic
theory,
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
a
variety
of
considerations
which
congress
might
reasonably
feel,
would
make
it
more
dangerous
to
allow
price
fixing
in
this
area.one
of
these
is
this.
if
you
allow
competitors
to
get
together
to
fix
the
price
of
product
a,
it
may
be
that
the
understandings
which
are
reached
there
will
not
stop
at
that
point
and
that
they'll
flow
over
into
forbidden
territory
there
--
is
every
indication
throughout
the
discussion
of
this
proviso
that
congress
was
afraid
about
getting
together
competitors
that
was
enactment
to
it.
maybe
it
felt
that
if
competitors
got
together
at
(inaudible)
that
you
couldn't
confine
it
within
the
boundaries
of
--
of
purely
trademark
products.
then
there
are
other
considerations
which
we
think
might
lead
to
similar
conclusions.
we
think
that
they
are
dangerous
when
an

which
are
not
present
with

manufacturer,
it
does
so.
because
if
a
manufacturer
who
was
also
an
important
wholesaler,
price
fixes
at
the
wholesale
level,
he
is
in
a
position
to
offer
the
wholesalers
the
advantage
of
price
rigidity
if
they
buy
from
him
while
threatening
them
at
the
same
time
with
impressive
competition
if
they
buy
from
other
manufacturers.

we
think
that
that

by
an
individual
legislator
as
to
what

would
have.
now,
i
would
seriously
doubt
that
such
an
expression
of
an
opinion
by
an
individual
legislator
even
if
he
where
in
some
more
direct
connection
with
the
legislation,
and
senator
humphrey
was,
could
prevail
as
against
language
which
is
this
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
explicit.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
