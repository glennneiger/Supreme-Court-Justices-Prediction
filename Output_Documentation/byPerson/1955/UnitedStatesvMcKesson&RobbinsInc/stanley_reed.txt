well,
then
there
is
species
of
competition
between
mckesson
wholesale
divisions
and
mckesson
manufacturing
division
in
selling
to
the
drug
retailers?
justice
stanley
reed
your
objection
to
mckesson's
manufacturing
division
agreeing
that
they
use
the
same
prices
when
the
come
to
the
drug
retailers,
same
fix
prices?
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
mean
to
sell
at
the
same
prices.
perhaps,
a
variation
in
that
but
they
--
they
get
an
agreement
with
the
drug
retailers
that
--
that
they
will
not
sell
below
in
this
price.
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
that.
so
that
leaves
the
only
thing
the
independent
wholesalers
at
mckesson's
wholesale
division?
justice
stanley
reed
but
if
you
cut
out
the
wholesalers
and
had
--
merely
mckesson
agreeing
with
the
independent
wholesalers
that
the
independent
wholesalers
would
require
drug
retailers
to
sell
at
a
fix
prize?
justice
stanley
reed
that
would
be
alright.
justice
stanley
reed
is
it
--
is
it
a
written
contract
that
mckesson
has
of
the
independent
wholesalers?
justice
stanley
reed
and
do
they
have
the
same
contract
with
--
with
their
own
wholesale
divisions?
justice
stanley
reed
14.5%
is
off
the
list.
justice
stanley

14.5%
is

the
list
of
price.
