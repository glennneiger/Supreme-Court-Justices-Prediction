justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
case
came
up
on
summary
judgment
or
after
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim
that
those
violate
the
--
the
mcguire
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
form
this
chart?
you
say
that
both
independent
wholesalers
and
mckesson
wholesaler
divisions
handle
nonmckesson
products,
products
other
than
mckesson's
products
as
well
as
mckesson
product
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
fair
trading
with
those
products
between
the
two
wholesalers
--
two
groups
of
wholesalers
shown
in
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
find
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
whether
there's
any
fair
trading
as
between
mckesson
wholesale
divisions
and
independent
wholesalers
are
nonmckesson
products?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
only
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
these
wholesaler
divisions,
are
they
separate
corporations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
the
--
what
was
his
comment
that
call
your
attention
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
confuse
me
because
i
thought
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
these
contracts
were
not
within
--
were
--
were
not
within
the
mcguire
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
in
the
case
on
both
sides
whatever
they
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could,
perhaps,
i
ought
to
address
this
to
the
government
but
since
it's
throughout
your
business
practice,
would
you
look
at
this
chart
for
a
minute.
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question?
what
i
want
to
ask
you
is
this,
mr.
mcgrath.
take
the
line
that
from
manufacturing
division
through
mckesson
wholesale
division
through
the
drug
retailers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
indicates,
there
are
some
sales
that
are
ultimately
made
to
drug
retailers
from
the
--
by
that
rule.
what's
the
difference
between
that
method
of
sale
and
the
--
and
the
line
that
goes
straight
down
from
the
manufacturing
division
to
the
drug
retailers,
leaving
out
this
question,
the
special
discount,
what's
the
difference
of
the
two
operations?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
just
one.
these
are
simply
distribution
of
it.
aren't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so,
that
in
essence
there's
not
difference
in
--
in
between
those
two
methods
of
sale
and
they
were
made
directly
from
a
--
from
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
there
economic
difference?
