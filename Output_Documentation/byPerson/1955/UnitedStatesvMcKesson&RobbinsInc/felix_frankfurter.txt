wasn't
the
entire
act
contended
to
the
clarification
of
what
--
what
might
call
--
some
of
the
--
they
lack
ambiguities,
the
lack
of
clarities
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
change.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
market
in
each
products
and
all
the
rest
of
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
for
the
--
the
bear
section
of
my
eyes
drug
dealers
if
the
arrow
is
going
to
the
mckesson's
wholesale
division,
the
arrows
going
to
independent
wholesalers
(inaudible)
or
reach
are
intended
for
to
obtain
drug
dealers,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
going
to
be
a
little
difficult
right
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
market?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
thing
on
this?
that
was
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show,
i
mean
the
--
is
it
relevant
whether
mckesson
as
fair
trade
restriction
against
retailers
who
it
supplies
directly
with
the
same
economic
consequence
as
the

which
it
speaks
define,
the
independent
also
reselling
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
the
tenor
of
this.do
i
infer
from
the
quotation,
i'm
going
to
the
opinion
that
he
rejected
the
rulings
of
this
court
that
price
fixing
is
in
it
of
itself
violates
the
(inaudible)
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
government's
position
is
that
the
mcguire
act
merely
lifted
that
bar
to
the
extent
that
it
lifted
it
--
to
the
extent
that
(inaudible)
the
law
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
is
that
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
judge
murphy's
opinion
as
i
gather
from
your
(inaudible)
per
se
illegal
has
been
replaced
by
(inaudible)
and
then
on
and
therefore,
the
--
nothing
is
per
se
anymore
violated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wouldn't
have
to
--
it
wouldn't
have
to
interpolate
that,
there
might
be
another
word
between
all
the
wholesalers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
i'm
sure
that
it
has
been
relevant
and

referred
to
it
but
(inaudible)
appear
this
remark
by

wherein
most
of
the

justice
felix
frankfurter
the
colloquy
senator

classification
shed
any
light
on
our
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,he
was
--
senator
sparkman
at
that
time
on
judiciary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
my
mind
is
that
if
this
is
a
remark
made
by
an
individual
member
that
is
non-authoritative
as
you
have
indicated
to
a
man
in
charge
of
the
bill,
(inaudible)
the
senate
would
have
a
great

that
it's
just
a
spontaneous
intervention.

justice

mr.
mcgrath,
may
i
ask
you
as
i
hope
that
(inaudible)
may
i
ask
you
from
your
point
of
view
what
is
the
economic
justification
or
position
that
you're
taking
as
i
hope
you
will
tell
us
what
the
objection
is
apart
from
the
20%
discount
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
(voice
overlap)
upon
the
statute
of
this
doctrine,
did
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
give
the
same
answer
if
the
sale
of
your
wholesale
division
have
30%
off
of
this
as
against
25%
to
the
others
and
the
discount
allowed
for
your
retailers,
the
retailer
from
your
wholesale
division
are
up
to
20%
as
against
the
restricted
14.5%.
