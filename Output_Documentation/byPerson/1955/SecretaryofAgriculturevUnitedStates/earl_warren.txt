secretary
of

commission,
et

mr.
frankel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed
mr.
frankel
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
frankel,
although
your
time
is
just
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
you
say,
though,
that
the
moment
the
shippers
change
or
shift
from
rail
to
trucks
that
they
become
less
fastidious
about
the
kind
of
eggs
they
eat?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well
how
do
you
account
then
for
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no
but
there's
a
great
shift,
is
there
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
from
railroad
--
from
railroad
to
trucks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
also
there's
a
great
--
a
great
void
between
the
--
the
damage
done
by
railroads
and
those
done
by
trucks.
now,
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
these
same
shippers
will
not
be
as
critical
about
the
eggs
they
--
they
receive
by
truck
as
they
were
by
the
--
of
those
that
they
receive
by
rail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howell,
i
--
i
would
like
to
ask
you
what
reason
you
can
assign
for
shippers
being
less
diligent
in
collecting
the
damages
for
breakage
when
they
ship
by
truck
than
when
they
ship
by
train?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
reasonable
answer
to
that
as
far
as
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
they
--
when
they
have
a
right
of
action
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
should
there
be
--
why
should
there
be
so
much
--
more
breakage
there
than
in
--
say
in
the
western
part
of
the
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howell.
mr.
zearfaus.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
one
mr.
zearfaus?
chief
justice
earl
warren
brief
for
intervening
railroads?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
by,
we
help
you
and
you
help
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the--
how
about
the
fellow
who's
careful
about
his
eggs
and
--
and
sends
them
in
the
first
class
shape
and
he
has
paid
his
tolerance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
will
it
--
will
it
be
a
simple
as
you
say
if
this
goes
through
because
i
understand
you
from
the
briefs
that
you
have
to
--
have
to
pay
damages
in
most
of
your
shippers
anyway,
in
new
york
because
you're
that
high
in
your
breakage.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
in
most
and
practically
all
your
shipments
into
new
york
that
we're
--
that
we're
talking
about
here,
your
rate
of
breakage
is
more
than
the
3%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
--
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
claims
anyway
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
why
would
it
bring
about
uniformity
just
to
--
just
to
give
a
tolerance
that
that
everybody's
got
to
pay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
charges
everybody
the
same,
regardless
of
the
distance
or
--or
any
of
the
other
factors
that
are
involved.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
fair
to
the
--
is
that
fair
to
the
policy
we
don't
have
that
much
breakage?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
if
there
are
any
other
commodities
where
the
commission
has
set
a
tolerance
comparable
to
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
frankel.
