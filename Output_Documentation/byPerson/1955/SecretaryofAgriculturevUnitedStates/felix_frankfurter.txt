you
mean
a
class
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
interrupt
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
to
infer
from
that
you
have
used
the
general
question
to
all
that
is
pending
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
need
to
hear
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
government
has
made
sure
that
do
not
alter
findings
without
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true
at
all
with
the
issue
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
at
this
point
in
view
of
another
district
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
different
from
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
implying
that
the
--
that
the
regulations
of
section
20
(11)
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that
one's
here
(inaudible)
comes
in
the
conclusion
of
the
said
grain
(inaudible)
that
in
every
shipment,
every
usable
shipment,
which
i
am
saying
if
they
couldn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
pretend
--
let's
pretend
that
the
regulation
that
it
wouldn't
(inaudible)
relatively
small,
it's
normal
and
delicate,
couldn't
they
been
(inaudible)
new
rule
about
defined
proof
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
the
egg
is
wrecked?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
would
like
to
just
compromise
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
allow
me
to
read
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
on
page
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't'
mean
--
it
doesn't
mean
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
to
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
regulation
given
to
the
carriers
liability
and
gives
liability
without
a
clause
referenced
and
they're
not
bringing
to
court
in
an
equity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
howell,
how
would
you
account
do
you
see
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
west
or
north?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
also
the
shipping
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
the
problem
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
i
must
see
now,
whether
it
will
establish
whether
the
record
shows
that
is
left
(inaudible)
in
fact
holding
or
whether
there
are
alleged
lawsuits
to
bring.
according
to
the
latter,
that
might
be
absorbed
but
it
might
be
absorbed
from
the
lower
rates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
you
do
not
know
the
answer
is
physical.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
old
common
law,
that's
the
basis
of
liability.
and
under
the
commerce
act,
amendment
became
a
law,
it
was
lifted.
it
was
an
opinion
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
commission
--
does
the
commissioner
agree
one
of
the
position
that's
made
from
this
question.
but
when
did
the
letter
find
any
regulation
that
the
commission
as
well
as
carrier
had
the
independent
view
of
the
5%.
in
other
words,
may
the
commission
upon
the
problems
of
carrier
is
going
to
be
(inaudible)
a
certain
way
through
testing,
may
the
commission
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
find
the
test
and
no
more
has.
and
that's
--
that
is
as
i
understand
it
is
informed
when
they're
talking
of
generalities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
nothing
is
done
about
it.
would
commission
with
the
finding
that
it
has
no
legal
implication
with
that?or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
finding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
would
it
be
binding
for
us
to
preclude
the
requiring
of
a
20
(11)
from
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
not.
now,
suppose
you
said
as
the
carrier
--
carrier
is
operating
because
nobody
objects
or
suspicious
of
him.
suppose
you've
got
a
situation
like
this.
there
is
a
contention.
and
there
is
inquiry
within
all
of
the
commission
is
the
fact
that
the
commission
make
affirmatively
an
order.
thanks
to
the
certain
limitation
on
liability,
certain
basis
of
recovery
for
loss.
does
that
make
a
difference
before
the
commission?
is
it
an
order
that
i
can
see
of
the
record
on
the
part
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
ideal
numbers
are
lowered
by
the
commission
it
represents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
difference
is
that
you
lumped
them
altogether
in
the
common
law
you
actually
it
individually.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
do
you
really,
what
does
it
need
to
ensure
he's
making
a
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
real
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
cost
is
involved
in
getting
certificate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
$15
per
car?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
--
you
are
giving
me
--
you
spoke
that
the
policy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
in
the
decision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
the
record
show
--
the
statute
which
there
is
the
actual
litigation
over
these
principles
and
to
which
comes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
doesn't
rely
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
your
argument
is
let
me
go
to
the
litigation.
it's
part
of
the
difficulty
of
moving
your
position
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
these
claims
are
numbered
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
i
have
it.
it's
constantly
is
a
larger
number.
there
are
two
big
ones
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
are
you
going
to
tell
me?
is
this
running
into
the
hundreds
or
tens
or
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
but
that's
different
here
we
have
to
redo,
work
your
argument
in
the
general
direction
to
move
in
the
decision.
that
it's
not
within
your
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
difference
(inaudible)
to
legislation
the
court
held
that
in
determining
decision
is
to
take
averages
we're
supposed
to
accomplish
this
is
on
the
shell
eggs
in
the
proper
decision
in
one
wherein
if
too
much
was
done
it
would
tolerate
it.
but
for
this
(inaudible)
but
it
was
allowed.
the
court
said
that
that
should
be
completely
read
(inaudible)
it
is
unfairly
dealt
with,
then
from
anytime
a
--a
federal
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it's
only
certain
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
only
covered
a
percent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
in
what
percent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
--
what
is
the
foundation
of
that?
is
that
what's
coming?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
every
one
of
their
vendors
have
shipped
off
these
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
it's
3
or
4.5%?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
(inaudible)
to
the
fact
the
inherent
--
the
inherent
difficulty
to
prove
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
object
of
the
question
is
to
establish
in
here
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that's
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
