mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
direct
appeals
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
for
the
district
of
utah,
which
by
a
divided
vote
sustained
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
approving
certain
tariff
regulations
to
the
nation's
railroads.
under
the
commission's
order,
which
i
shall
describe
more
fully
in
a
while,
the
railroads
all
over
the
country
are
free
in
all
circumstances
for
specified
percentages
of
damage
in
egg
shipments
delivered
by
them.
a
number
of
protestants
appeared
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
opposed
these
regulations.
the
protestants
included
egg
shippers
all
over
the
country,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
his
role
as
statutory
representative
of
the
agriculture
community,
the
department
of
the
army
on
behalf
of
the
national
military
establishment,
which
buy
the
lot
of
eggs.
the
united
states
with
the
statutory
defendant
as
it
is
in
all
such
cases
in
the
court
below.
however,
it
aligned
itself
with
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
urging
that
the
commission's
order
and
the
regulations,
the
commission
approved
were
invalid
and
the
united
states
is
here
again
aligned
with
the
secretary
in
urging
reversal.
now,
i'm
here
to
argue
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
and
the
united
states.
we
filed
a
joint
brief.
three
other
appellants,
egg
shippers
have
filed
a
separate
brief
also
urging
reversal,
are
substantially,
on
the
grounds
we
pressed
with
differences,
of
course,
in
the
answers
and
detail.
now,
these
other
appellants
have
relinquished
their
time
for
oral
argument
and
i
shall
present
as
fully
as
i
can,
the
grounds
on
which
we
commonly
urge
reversal.
now,
the
regulations
have
approved,
issued
with
the
commission's
approval
by
the
railroad
appear
at
--at
pages
52
through
54
of
volume
1
of
the
record.
and
we
are
concerned
here
particularly
with
section
6
and
7
of
these
regulations,
which
are
at
pages
53
and
54
of
the
record.
these
regulations
if
you
can
see
provide
that,
“on
eggs
placed
in
packages
at
rail
point
of
origin
of
the
shipment,
the
railroads
are
in
no
case
to
be
liable
for
damage,
where
the
damage
does
not
exceed
3%
of
the
contents
of
the
packages
containing
damaged
eggs.”
section
7
provides
that
where
the
eggs
are
placed
in
packages
at
points
elsewhere
than
a
the
rail
point
of
origin,
the
limitations,
well,
i
shouldn't
say
limitation,
that's
our
issue.
the
percentage
for
which
the
railroads
are
not
to
be
liable
is
5%.
in
both
cases,
the
3%
and
5%
regulations,
if
carrier
liability
is
shown,
that
liability
is
not
to
be
for
anything
except
the
excess
over
the
3%
and
5%.
so
that
in
all
cases,
the
railroads
are
not
liable
for
either
3%
or
5%.
now,
both
of
these
sections
contained
a
--
an
exception.
and
that
exception
provides
that
where
the
shipper
has
obtained
a
federal
or
a
state
grading
certificate
showing
the
amount
of
damage
in
the
eggs
at
the
rail
point
of
origin
the
percentage
for
which
the
railroad
is
not
to
be
liable
is
to
be
that
amount
plus
1%.
now,
we
argued
below
on
a
number
of
grounds
that
these
regulations
were
unreasonable
and
unlawful
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
but
our
main
argument
was
then
and
my
main
argument
here
will
be
that
these
are
limitations
of
liability
forbidden
by
section
20
(11)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
is
it
is
set
out
and
printed
in
part
at
pages
20
and
21
of
the
government's
brief.
in
a
word,
our
position
has
been
that
regulations,
which
declare
as
this
do,
that
no
claim
shall
be
allowed
for
specified
percentages
of
the
damage,
our
position
has
been
that
this
is
clear
and
unmistakable
limitation
of
liability
forbidden,
admittedly,
limitations
of
liability
are
forbidden
by
section
20
(11).
we
have
a
segment
that
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
doesn't
turn
on
the
3
or
the
5,
your
honor.
now,
i
--
i
should
say
we
have
a
second
point,
less
important,
but
also
in
itself
an
independent
ground
for
reversal
which
is,
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
do
not
sustain
its
order
approving
these
regulations
in
this
case.
but
our
main
argument
is
that
no
such
regulations
could
be
valid
under
section
20
(11)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
a
class
regulation,
which
covers
all
shipments
in
advance
without
regard
to
these
particular
facts
of
any
particular
case
and
the
evidence
in
any
particular
case.
now,
i'm
pleased
to
report
that
for
both
of
these
arguments,
it's
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
wade
through
the
evidence
in
these
too
cumbersome
volumes
of
the
record.
however,
the
court
will
want
to
have
as
the
concrete
setting,
which
these
issues
arise
had
recognized
that
we
are
seeking
to
overturn
an
administrative
determination.
and
before
proceeding
with
my
argument,
i
shall
review
in
some
detail
the
findings
and
the
conclusions
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
are
not
--
we
do
not
raise
the
question
of
substantiality,
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
findings.
we
do
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
--
well,
i
--
i
had
hoped
that
the
outset,
then
to
report
of
the
secretary.
we
do
contend
and
this
is
another
point,
to
which
you
need
consider
only
the
commission's
findings.
we
contend
that
there
was
a
finding,
contained
inconsistencies
and
deficiencies,
which
makes
them
insufficient
to
support
this
order.
but
for
that,
you
need
only
look
at
those
findings
in
the
commission's
report.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
right.
and
for
that,
i
may
slip
occasionally
and
make
reference
to
the
evidence
for
illustrative
--
illustrative
purposes
but
i
think
i
can
barely
say
that
as
our
positions
presented
in
this
court,
we
have
not
raised
those
questions
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
findings.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
can't
visualize
the
possibility
of
the
court's
not
agreeing
but
i'm
trying
to
imagine
it,
i
would
say
that
we
have
a
serious
problem
getting
you
to
read
the
evidence
on
the
basis
of
the
questions
we
presented
to
you.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
i
should
say
that
the
--
the
egg
shippers
have
raised
questions
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and
i
have
heard
and
i
appreciate
the
question
because
although
i
don't
represent
the
egg
shippers,
i
should
do
nothing
to
damage
their
case.
they
may
have
fairly
presented
the
problems
with
the
evidence
and
then
i
do
regret
my
(inaudible)
i
hope
to
make
up
with
by
demonstrating
that
you
don't
have
to
read
the
evidence,
anyhow.
now,
in
the
commission's
report,
which
appears
beginning
at
page
12
of
the
record
and
it
goes
on
at
page
43,
the
commission
noted
at
the
outset
that
beginning
after
1941,
the
railroads
had
been
paying
large
claims
for
damage
to
shell
egg
shipments.
i
emphasize
that
they've
paying
them,
not
merely
receiving
them.
but
the
commission
pointed
out
in
its
findings
that
the
problem
had
not
been
a
serious
one
prior
to
world
war
ii.
in
1941,
the
total
of
damage
payments
for
the
entire
country
was
$110,000
a
modest
figure.
thereafter
however,
the
amount
rose
steadily
and
very
sharply
reaching
a
peak
of
some
$2,300,000
in
1947.
now,
the
findings
show
that
there
were
no
changes
in
the
chickens
or
the
eggs
or
in
the
practices
of
the
people
packing
them.
the
commission
did
find
that
during
the
war
and
for
sometime
thereafter,
poor
railroad
equipment
and
inexperienced
railroad
personnel
had
contributed
to
this
damage.
the
commission
then
noted
that
this
situation,
this
deficiency
in
the
railroad,
had
apparently
improved
at
some
point
after
the
war.
but
the
high
post-war
damage
claims
as
contrasted
with
the
modest
pre-war
claims
continues.
now,
there
is
no
finding
in
the
commission's
report
to
indicate
why
this
should
have
been
so,
why
there
was
difference
between
the
low
pre-war
and
the
high
post-war
claims
for
damage
to
show
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
the
commission
also
found
that
this
increase
in
the
war
years
and
the
years
after
resulted
almost
entirely
from
a
great
increase
in
claims
on
the
eastern
seaboard
on
eggs
coming
to
the
eastern
seaboard
and
particularly
to
new
york.
the
commission
expressly
found
that
generally
there
had
been
no
increases
in
the
south
or
the
west
and
the
southwest.
but
that
in
new
york,
the
increase
was
so
dramatic
as
to
account
for
substantially
all
of
this
nationwide
increase
in
claims.
now
on
that,
the
shippers
testified
and
this
is
reviewed
in
the
commission's
findings
that
the
high
damage
claims
in
new
york
could
be
accounted
for
by
rough
handling
of
cars,
poor
switching
and
its
loading
operations
in
new
york
area.
the
commission
stated
that
it
was
unable
to
determine
from
this
record
that
this
explanation
accounted
for
the
situation
in
new
york.
the
carriers
on
the
other
hand
suggested
that
consignees
in
new
york
are
more
fastidious
and
that
this
accounted
for
the
high
claims
in
new
york.
the
commission
expressly
rejected
that
attempted
explanation
as
being
unsupported
by
the
record.
the
upshot
on
this
striking
difference
between
the
eastern
seaboard
and
the
rest
of
the
country
is
that
there
is
no
finding
anywhere
in
the
commission's
report
as
to
why
this
difference
exist.
no
finding
despite
the
fact
that
they
ultimately
issued
regulations
of
nationwide
applicability
over
the
protests
of
shippers
across
the
nation.
the
commission
made
another
important
finding.
it
found
that
on
trucks,
the
damaged
egg
is
negligible.
for
the
railroads,
the
commission
later
approved
tolerance
regulations
based
through
substantial
extent
on
the
proposition
that
most
of
these
tolerance
percentages
are
taken
up
in
damage
in
the
egg
when
the
shipper
gives
them
to
the
carrier.
now,
the
commission
found
that
shipping
practices
are
uniform
throughout
the
country.
there
is
no
finding
in
the
commission's
report
to
explain
why
then
there
is
negligible
damage
on
trucks
with
these
uniform
practice
and
the
supposed
handling
by
the
shipper
to
the
carrier
of
damaged
egg.
why
there
is
no
damage
on
trucks
was
mentioned
and
this
--
our
damage
on
the
railroad
confined
for
these
in
figures.
on
this,
the
commission
merely
found
and
it
has
figures
to
demonstrate
this
that
in
the
late
years
of
the
last
decade,
there
was
a
dramatic
shift
of
the
egg
shipping
business
from
the
railroads
to
the
trucks.
now,
the
findings
show
that
thousands
of
cases
of
eggs
are
shipped
to
all
parts
of
the
country
with
no
damage,
arriving
in
good
order.
and
this,
of
course,
includes
new
york,
people
in
new
york
who've
eaten
soft-boiled
eggs
know
that
some
eggs
get
to
new
york
without
being
broken.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
large
amounts
of
them
do.
there
all
are
extremely
large
and
impressively
large
claims
for
damage
in
new
york.
if
i
mentioned
here
your
point,
it
seems
to
us
in
court
that
in
new
york
to
some
degree
and
in
the
rest
of
the
country
for
a
very
marked
degree,
eggs
are
shipped
and
arrive
without
damage.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
records
does
not
show
that,
your
honor.
the
shippers
who
have
switched
from
the
railroads
to
the
trucks
are
presumably
making
the
same
shipments.
in
fact,
shippers
from
the
far
west
testified
in
the
record
that
their
shipments
from
there
to
new
york
arrive
more
quickly
by
truck
than
by
train
which
in
addition
to
the
lower
damage
and
better
service
that
was
one
of
their
reasons
for
switching
to
the
trucks.
now,
the
commission
did
find,
and
we
don't
excuse
this
finding,
that
eggs
are
fragile,
that
a
substantial
amount
of
them
are
imperfect
when
they
are
given
to
the
carrier.
and
that
some
are
inevitably
damaged
in
transit.
at
pages
31
and
32
of
the
record,
the
commission
reviewed
certain
studies
on
this
problem.
one
study
by
the
department
of
agriculture
showed
that
in
115
cars
of
eggs,
there
has
been
1.4%
of
stains
and
dirties,
dirty
to
stained
eggs
or
eggs
stained
from
contact
with
broken
eggs.
dirty
eggs
are
eggs
with
adhering
--
they're
usually
from
the
nest
and
not
a
kind
of
imperfection
that
would
be
likely
to
be
a
part
of
the
damage,
a
carrier
would
have
to
pay
for.
in
these
115
cars,
there
was
found
an
average
of
1.4%
stains
and
dirties,
1.9%
checked
eggs.
checked
eggs
are
eggs
with
some
imperfection
in
the
shell
usually
are
not
visible
through
the
naked
eye
with
the
shell
membrane
intact
so
that
the
egg
does
not
leak
or
in
any
way
spewed
its
content.
1.4%
stains
and
dirties,
1.9%
checked
eggs
and
1/10th
of
1%
designated
loss
in
this
study
by
department
of
agriculture
of
eggs
as
they
were
about
to
be
handed
to
the
carrier
for
shipment.
now,
other
studies
showed
varying
percentages.other
studies
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
the
railroads
themselves
showed
percentages
of
this
kind
of
imperfection
ranging
from
below
1%
to
upwards
of
3%
and
in
some
individual
cases,
7%.
now,
concentrating
on
this
3.4%
study,
i
should
emphasize
that
over
half
of
this
month's
total
of
3.4%
was
the
1.9%
checks
which
the
commission
pointed
out
was
a
kind
of
imperfection
which
could
not
be
detected
by
the
kind
of
inspection
performed
by
the
company
at
destination.
these
checks
were
detected
by
candling
and
clicking,
candling
is
process
of
holding
an
egg
before
a
light
to
examine
its
interior
quality
and
its
exterior
imperfections
not
visible
to
the
naked
eye.
clicking
is
a
process
i
can't
describe
expertly
that
involved
bumping
eggs
together
to
tell
by
the
sound
about
imperfections
that
can't
be
seen.
according
to
the
record,
to
a
trained
ear
a
perfect
shell
gives
a
clear
and
bell-like
tone
when
the
eggs
are
--
come
together
and
click.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
the
court
please,
before
lunch,
i
was
reviewing
these
studies
that
played
an
important
part
in
the
commission's
decision,
studies
showing
undetected
imperfections
in
eggs
given
to
the
carrier
for
shipment.
i
pointed
out
that
in
one
study
there
was
3.4%
of
such
imperfection
made
up
of
check,
stains
and
only
one
tenth
of
one
percent
eggs
was
designated
as
loss.
i
also
pointed
out
that
more
than
half
of
this
1.9%
was
a
kind
of
imperfection
that
could
not
be
discovered
by
the
kind
of
inspection
made
at
destination.
and
i
said
that
other
study
showed
varying
percentages
of
this
kind
of
imperfection.
please
review
it
at
pages
31
and
32
of
the
record
in
the
commission's
finding.
now,
the
inspection
at
destination
does
not
include
candling
and
clicking.
it's
a
joint
inspection
by
the
carrier
and
the
consignee
which
is
purely
visual
and
the
commission's
findings
also
show
that
at
least
equal
or
greater
amounts
of
imperfections
of
the
same
kind
as
those
shown
in
the
other
tests
are
undetected
at
the
destination.
that
is
to
say,
after
eggs
are
accepted
as
being
in
good
order
by
the
consignee
with
the
bad
eggs
put
aside,
studies
by
the
department
of
agriculture
showed
imperfections
of
the
same
kind
check,
stains,
dirty,
and
lost
eggs
totaling
from
3.9%
to
7%.
but
more
the
materials
before
it,
the
commission
concluded
that
for
eggs
packed
at
points
other
than
the
rail
point
of
origin,
the
5%
tolerance
would
be
reasonable
because
the
damage
for
which
the
carrier
is
not
responsible
averages
that
amount.
now,
i
emphasize
the
word
averages
because
it
plays
a
critical
part
in
our
argument.
similarly,
the
commission
held
that
the
3%
tolerance
for
eggs
packed
at
the
rail
point
of
origin
would
also
be
reasonable
because
of
the
same
theory
of
averages.
the
district
court
majority
found
that
this
problem
of
damage
and
the
tolerance
regulations
issued
because
of
this
was
a
part
of
the
whole
problem
of
rate
regulations,
and
the
kind
of
problem
confided
to
the
expertise
and
judgment
of
the
commission.
it
found
that
the
commission
findings
were
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
that
the
decision
and
the
carriers
regulations
it
approved
must
therefore
be
sustained.
judge
(inaudible)
dissenting,
concluded
that
these
regulations
were
limitations
of
liability
and
were
therefore
prohibited
by
section
20
(11)
of
the
act.
now,
as
i've
said,
we
agree
with
judge
(inaudible)
20
(11)
is
set
out
at
pages
20
and
21
of
the
government's
brief.
and
since
we
think
that
the
statute
almost
by
its
terms,
decides
this
case
in
now
favor,
if
the
court
will
be
indulge
me
i'd
like
to
read
it.
it
says
that
any
carrier
subject
to
the
act
receiving
property
for
interstate
transportation
shall
issue
a
receipt
or
bill
of
lading
therefore,
and
shall
be
liable
to
the
lawful
holder
thereof
for
any
loss,
damage,
or
injury
to
such
property
caused
by
it.
a
no
contract
receipt
rule
regulation
or
other
limitation
of
any
character
whatsoever,
shall
exempt
such
common
carrier
from
the
liability
hereby
imposed.
and
then,
in
language
which
may
almost
be
somewhat
repetitious
for
our
purposes,
this
point
about
limitations
of
liability
is
reemphasized.
the
statute
says
that
the
carrier
shall
be
liable
to
the
lawful
holder.
it
said
receipt
or
bill
of
lading
of
any
party
entitled
to
recover
thereon
for
the
full
actual
loss,
damage,
or
injury
to
such
property
caused
by
it,
again,
not
withstanding
any
limitations
of
liability
in
any
form
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
any
limitations
of
liability
in
any
form
in
regulation
or
another
form
is
unlawful
and
void.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
of
course
your
honor,
these
regulations
in
this
case
are
promulgated
by
the
railroads.
these
are
to
tell
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
until
set
aside
as
unreasonable
or
unlawful
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
by
the
commission,
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
they
presumably
offer
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
they
now,
have
the
sanction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
that
the
commission
has
held
them
to
be
valid.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
and
interstate
commerce
commission
has
so
treated
it.
the
commission
has
taken
as
we
presented
it,
the
problem
whether
these
regulations
issued
by
the
railroad
are
lawful
under
section
20
(11).
it
held
that
they
were.
and
it
recognized
that
the
question
is,
are
they?
and
the
statute
as
it's
just
been
pointed
to
me
refers
expressly
to
any
rule
or
regulation
or
any
tariff
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
not
being
permitted
to
contain
any
limitation
of
liability.
and
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
they've
been
variously
referred
to.
these
are
regulations,
a
pair
of
regulations.
they're
part
of
the
consolidated
freight
transportation
and
nobody
has
doubted
and
anytime
in
this
litigation
that
it
if
these
regulations
can't
be
squared
with
20
(11),
they
are
void.
the
whole
issue
has
been,
can
they
be
held
valid
against
this
sweeping
language
of
20
(11)
outlawing
any
limitation
of
liability
in
any
form.
as
a
matter
fact,
two
effects
of
section
20
(11)
are
undisputed.
first,
it
codifies
the
common
law
rule
that
carry
a
liability.
i
think
our
friends
on
the
other
side
have
some
ambiguities
in
there
briefs
with
their
emphasis
on
the
words
in
20
(11)
"caused
by
it".
but
there's
no
dispute
really
about
what
"caused
by
it"
means.
the
commission
itself
sets
it
out
in
its
report
at
page
40
of
the
record.
that
"caused
by
you",
refers
to
the
familiar
standard
of
the
liability
form
carrier.
that
is,
the
carrier's
liable
--
i'm
reading
the
commission's
word
at
page
40
at
the
record
--
for
failure
to
transport
safely
goods
entrusted
to
its
care,
unless
the
loss
or
damage
was
due
to
one
of
certain
causes
such
as
acts
of
god,
the
public
enemy,
the
act
of
the
shipper
or
the
nature
of
the
goods.
it
is
undisputed
that
when
the
carrier,
when
the
shipper
in
a
suit
for
damage
to
its
goods
proves
that
the
goods
were
given
to
the
carrier
in
good
order,
that
they
would
deliver
in
that
order
and
proves
the
amount
of
his
damage,
then
the
burden
is
upon
the
carrier
to
bring
himself
within
one
of
these
exceptions,
acts
of
god,
et
cetera.
now,
the
second
point
which
has
been
undisputed
of
which
i
should
emphasize
is
that
section
20
(11)
outlaws
any
limitation
of
liability
in
any
form
whatsoever.
and
it's
been
undisputed
that
if
regulations
of
this
kind
contain
limitations
of
liability,
they
are
void.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
--
the
--
the
answer
to
that
question
your
honor
is
the
answer
to
the
commission's
decision
as
we
see
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right.
and
there
are
causes
of
damage
in
the
transportation
of
goods
for
which
a
carrier
is
not
liable.
one
of
those
is
the
inherent
nature
of
the
goods.
if
the
carrier
can
show
in
the
particular
case
against
a
particular
holder
of
the
bill
of
lading
that
in
that
case,
the
damage
of
that
holder
of
bill
of
lading
is
claiming
compensation
for
was
caused
by
the
inherent
nature
of
the
goods,
then
of
course
we
can
see
that
the
carrier
is
not
liable.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
the
commodity
is
say
grain,
and
if
the
facts
show
that
grain
frequently
shrinks
but
sometimes
expands
when
its
shipped
then
our
argument
would
be
to
that
conclusion,
although
in
the
one-grain
case
that
your
honor
maybe
referring
to,
that
our
opponents
rely
on
the
physical
facts
are
different.
i
think
that
there
--
that
unrevealed
decision
is
probably
wrong
but
i
think
we
have
a
much
easier
situation
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
could.
it
could
find
for
example
and
this
is
purely
a
hypothetical
case
because
there's
no
case
in
history
where
it
has
found
it.
it
could
find
a
grain
always
in
every
case
(inaudible)
and
then
nobody
would
be
worried
about
economy,
but
supposed
it
found
that
any
shipper
coming
into
it
could
to
claim
that
the
carrier
loss
2%
of
its
grain
is
absolutely
for
close
in
every
case
from
showing
that
this
grain
didn't
shrink,
it
expanded.
it
--
it
accumulated
moisture
and
gained
in
weight
and
that
what
happened
is
that
the
carrier's
employees
took
off
with
100
pounds
of
grain.
now,
if
the
commission
on
physical
facts
like
that
and
knows
of
a
physical
fact
in
the
real
world
that
grain
sometimes
shrinks
and
sometimes
expands.
if
on
facts
like
that
it
approved
tolerance
regulations
of
uniform
application,
we
think
that
they
would
be
invalid.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right
and
--
i
keep
trying
to
lift
over
grained
eggs
because
i
recognize
fully
that
on
the
physical
fact,
your
honor
puts.
we
have
a
harder
case.
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
say
simply
that
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
which
i
suppose
strictly
is
true.
but
i
think
in
fairness
i
have
to
say,
that
as
we
read
the
statute,
and
if
we
read
the
(inaudible)
opinion
of
justice
holmes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
he
was
dealing
with
a
specific
case
with
a
specific
shipment
and
as
it
applied
to
that
shipment,
he
held
that
a
regulation
of
approved
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
invalid
because
it
denied
to
that
shipper
in
that
case
recovery
for
his
full
actual
loss
on
the
facts
of
that
case.
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
not
in
relation
to
a
problem
of
natural
shrinkage
and
here
we
have
a
problem
of
unnatural
breakage
if
you
plea.
so,
i
think
it's
--
it's
--
i
think
we
have
an
easy
case
here.
i
think
the
grain
case
is
a
relatively
difficult
one.
i've
tried
i've
to
say
in
full
honesty
to
the
court
that
the
rule
we
contend
for
in
our
judgment
extends
to
that
grain
situation.
but
then
i
emphasize
to
win
this
case
first
that
you
don't
have
a
problem
of
any
such
difficulty
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
case,
mr.
justice,
in
which
you
have
a
--
a
physical
law
of
the
undeviating
kind
that
would
lead
me
to
agree
with
the
suggestion
that
following
these
regulations
are
valid.
now,
here
we
have
a
case
where
it
demonstrates
that
thousands
of
carloads
of
eggs
are
shipped
all
over
the
country
without
damage,
without
any
damage
at
least
that
is
reflected
in
damage
claimed.
and
the
commission
found
that
the
differences
in
claim,
claims
asserted
and
paid
by
the
railroad
where
they
liability.
but
the
difference
cannot
be
attributed
to
differences
in
the
particularness
or
fastidiousness
of
the
consignees
or
the
claim
of
consciousness
of
the
consignee.
now,
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
may,
your
honor.
and
10%
of
the
shippers
of
a
due
have
even
inspections
that
are
referred
to
in
the
record
and
in
the
commission's
finding
part,
primarily
as
they
are
entitled,
grading
inspections.
they
are
to
determine
the
grade
of
the
egg.
they
do,
in
determining
grade
ascertain
the
amount
of
imperfections
in
the
egg.
now,
i'll
--
i'll
lift
the
head
of
my
argument
to
say
this.
that
if
the
affirmative
part
of
this
regulations,
the
3.5%
tolerances,
if
those
are
invalid
as
applied
to
eggs,
the
exception
we
think
is
equally
invalid.
and
that's
true
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
exception
itself
incorporates
1%
tolerance
in
addition
to
the
amount
of
imperfections
found
in
the
eggs
at
the
origin.
second,
i
might
say
that
this
inspection
which
causes
the
shipper
if
he
wants
it,
from
$11
to
$15
of
carload
is
not
one
that
the
average
shipper
voluntarily
undertakes
and
pays
for
it
and
is
not
one
that
the
commission
undertook
here
to
compel
any
shipper
he
make.
in
our
judgment,
it
is
--
it
would
be
at
most,
although
we
claim
the
exception
is
unlawful
too.
it
would
be
at
most
and
of
lawful
voluntary
alternative
to
an
unlawful
affirmative
tolerance
regulation
which
in
fact
i
will
apply
to
the
great
majority
of
shipment.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
think
the
one
percent
is
unlawful,
but
i
was
saying
something
additional.
i
was
saying
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
you
have
to
strike
down
the
affirmative
part
of
this
regulation,
the
three
and
five
percent
tolerances
which
in
fact
are
of
the
greatest
concerns,
and
if
you
agree,
too,
that
the
1%
is
subject
to
the
same
infirmity,
then
all
you'd
have
left
is
a
kind
of
shred
of
an
exception.
without
anything,
that
it
would
be
an
exception
too.
and
you
would
be
faced,
if
you
wanted
to
save
anything,
with
the
problem
of
writing
new
regulation
for
the
carrier
which
is
a
function,
we
assume
the
court
would
be
unwilling
to
undertake.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
other
point
with
respect
to
this
grading
certificate
inspection.
in
my
statement,
i
pointed
out
that
no
inspection
comparable
to
this
government
inspection
is
made
at
destination.
that's
a
quick,
visual,
joint
carrier-consignee
inspection
which
the
findings
of
the
commission
show
leave
undetected
the
same
amount
of
the
same
kind
of
imperfections
that
this
origin
inspection
show.
there's
no
candling
or
clicking
as
this
government
inspections
include.
therefore,
if
you
left
this
exception
to
stand,
and
if
it
had
any
function
at
all,
it
would
place
on
the
shipper's
shoulders,
not
only
the
ordinarily
undetected
origin
damage,
but
also
the
same
kind
of
damage
which
is
undetected
by
consignees
at
destination.
now,
the
shippers
in
this
case,
and
their
testimony
pointed
out
that
it
would
be
agreeable
to
them,
if
you
could
have
a
system
of
comparable,
fair
inspection
at
both
ends
of
the
trip.
but
you
don't
get
that
in
this
certificate
exception
which
even
apart
from
this
1%
tolerance
which
--
to
which
our
argument
go
directly
even
apart
from
that,
is
an
unfair
and
unreasonable
imposition
on
the
shipper.
and
as
i
say,
the
commission
did
not
present
it
as
an
imposition
but
merely
as
a
voluntary
device,
now
you
used
by
10%
of
shippers
by
which
they
could,
in
the
commission's
view,
escape
what
we
think
is
the
clearly
unlawful
impact
of
these
3%
and
5%
tolerances.
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
don't
think
we
--
that
it's
possible
to
reach
that
problem
on
these
findings.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
it
wasn't
that
view
and
we
say
that
view
is
incorrect
first,
because
the
commission
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
it
depends
on
what
one
means
by
true,
mr.
justice
reed.
if
it's
true
as
an
average
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
would
to
meet
it
on
that
ground
because
that's
the
commission's
ground,
an
average
loss
of
1%,
thousands
of
carloads,
and
almost
all
of
those
that
go
to
the
west
and
the
pacific
coast
shippers
are
screaming
about
these
regulations,
arrive
with
no
damage.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
commission
says
so.
we
think
not.
but
assume
it
is.
assume
that
it
is
an
average
loss
of
1%.
that
means
by
definition
and
by
the
commission's
findings
in
this
case
that
there
were
there
losses
above
1%
and
below
1%.
now,
what
about
the
shipper
who
has
no
imperfections
in
his
egg,
is
a
holder
of
the
bill
of
lading
under
section
20
(11).
he
is
entitled
to
recover
his
full
actual
loss
under
section
20(11).
now,
of
course,
this
was
the
burden
on
carriers.
this
court's
decision
at
the
common
law
as
well
under
section
20
(11),
recognized
that
this
is
a
high
standard
of
care.
and
in
the
real
facts
of
the
real
world,
i
have
no
doubt
that
carriers
sometimes
pay
for
losses
which
an
omniscient
mind
would
know
they
were
not
responsible
for
this.
but
under
their
high
burden
of
proof,
resulting
from
a
familiar
rule
of
public
policy,
that's
part
of
the
risk
of
doing
business
that
they'd
bear
that
cannot
be
solved.
the
commission
at
pages
63
and
64
of
its
brief
tells
us
that
it's
a
(inaudible)
tells
us
that
there's
nothing
wrong
with
averages
because
averages
have
been
used
from
time
immemorial
in
making
rates.
an
average
risk
of
loss
and
risk
of
damage
claim
is
a
familiar
component
of
the
rates
the
commission
will
authorize.
we
agree
with
that.
we
agree
that
in
a
rate
proceeding,
the
commission
might
well
take
into
account
the
amount
of
damage
claim
the
carriers
have
being
paying
on
it.
well,
i
might
mention
in
that
connection
that
if
final
means
clear,
that
the
carriers
are
losing
money
on
carrying
eggs,
even
with
this
high
damage
claims
in
new
york.
i
refer
only
to
the
record
for
those
situations,
i
mean
including
those
situations.
if
you
look
at
page
1016
of
the
record
in
the
second
volume,
you'll
discover
that
while
this
investigation
was
in
progress,
there
was
a
change
in
rates
that's
very
pertinent
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
1016.
prior
to
september
1950,
the
carload
rates
on
poultry,
butter,
cheese
and
eggs
had
all
been
the
same.
in
september
1950,
while
this
investigation
was
underway,
the
railroads
reduced
their
rates
on
poultry,
butter,
and
cheese
by
what
it
said
here
to
be
about
$150.
they
left
the
rates
on
eggs
the
same.
now,
it's
entirely
reasonable,
although
this
is
not
a
rate
case
and
there's
no
evidence
on
it.
it's
entirely
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
reason
the
carriers
left
their
egg
rates
high,
and
reduced
the
others,
is
that
it
cost
them
more
to
carry
eggs.
now,
in
publishing
rate
and
in
the
commission's
approval
or
disapproval
of
rates,
this
is
a
valid
consideration.
it's
not
valid
because
section
20
(11)
forbids
its
validity
in
dealing
with
this
problem
of
claims
by
holders
of
bills
of
lading
to
recover
in
each
case
the
full
actual
loss
they
are
able
to
prove.
let
me
refer
to
one
other
page
of
the
record
that's
interesting
on
this
rate
question.
at
page
1165
--
1165,
there
is
a
table
showing
over
the
years
involved
in
this
case,
the
net
income
of
railroads
from
carrying
eggs.
and
very
interestingly,
it
shows
with
index
figures
that
between
1939
and
1948,
when
this
eastern
seaboard
problem
was
drawing
and
egg
damage
claims
on
the
eastern
seaboard
were
rising,
the
net
income
of
the
railroad
from
the
carriage
of
eggs
after
payment
of
the
claim
was
60%
higher
in
1948
than
it
had
been
in
1939.
now,
i
don't
feel
that
we
have
to
argue,
that
we're
really
equipped
to
argue
in
this
case
that
the
railroads
are
getting
rich,
or
going
broke
on
the
carriage
of
eggs.
the
important
thing
is
that
this
is
not
a
rate
proceeding.
you
can't
answer
those
questions
on
this
record.
and
if
as
the
commission
says,
these
averages
are
valid
in
rate
proceedings,
and
we
agree,
then
they
ought
to
be
presented
in
rate
proceedings,
and
if
the
carriers
as
we
think
the
record
makes
doubtful.
but
if
the
carriers
are
losing
money
on
the
carriers
of
eggs,
their
remedy
is
through
that
familiar
device
of
a
rating
fee
and
fragility
which
is
after
all
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
eggs
don't
break
themselves.
they're
fragile.
fragility
and
risk
of
damage
claims
generally
is
one
of
the
most
familiar
and
elementary
considerations
in
a
rate
proceeding.
this
court
had
mentioned
it.
the
commission
mentioned
it
in
its
brief
and
countless
decisions
of
the
commission
testify
to
that.
now,
with
the
rate
rise,
if
there
is
a
problem,
it
can
be
solved.
it
cannot
be
solved,
we
say,
by
this
use
of
averages
to
control
every
single
case,
no
matter
what
any
shipper
can
show
and
preclude
every
shipper
from
collecting
3%
or
5%
of
the
damage
even
when
he
shows
in
a
particular
case
that
his
eggs
were
smashed
up
by
the
utter
carelessness
and
negligence
of
the
railroad.
now,
this
is
not
a
problem
for
abstract
study.
the
fact
is
that
the
railroads
who've
been
paying
these
claims
before
this
regulation,
that
is,
recognizing
their
liability
on
it,
are
well
able
to
distinguish
between
the
various
causes
of
damage
to
particular
shipment.
now,
we
--
there
is
in
the
record
an
exhibit
35
which
shows
the
study
by
the
freight
claim
division
of
the
association
of
american
railroads,
breaking
down
the
causes
of
damage
in
various
kinds
of
shipments
and
specifically
in
egg
shipments.
and
their
investigation
showed
that
in
such
and
such
a
percentage
of
cases,
the
damage
was
due
to
bad
equipment.
in
such
and
such
a
percentage,
the
damage
was
due
to
negligence
of
employee
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
and
then
after
they
investigate,
in
one
case
where
they
find
they
were
negligent,
they
may
well
pay
the
claim.
in
another
case,
where
they
find
that
they
were
not
at
fault,
that
they
believe
they
were
not,
they
don't
pay
the
claim.
and
everybody
knows
particularly
since
it's
unlawful
to
pay
for
a
claim
that
the
railroads
don't
pay
them
unless
they
think
they're
liable.
but
the
commission
says
here,
“the
railroads
were
paying
large
claims,
paying
them
because
they
were
liable.”
so,
they
instituted
these
regulations
to
improve
that
situation.
that
is,
to
reduce
the
amount
of
claims.
now,
that
it
seems
to
us
is
in
its
barest
and
most
obvious
point
a
reduction
of,
a
limitation
of
liabilities.
and
in
fact,
the
evidence
shows
that
these
tolerances
cut
the
claim
by
35%
to
40%
because
the
tolerances
applied
which
you
see,
not
as
a
percentage
of
the
whole
shipment
but
as
a
percentage
of
the
eggs
in
the
damaged
cases.
so
that
if
a
shipper's
claim
let's
say
for
10%
of
the
eggs
in
the
damaged
cases,
a
5%
tolerance
doesn't
cut
the
claim
5%.
it
cuts
it
in
half.
and
experience
working
under
this
kind
of
tolerance
had
shown,
according
to
the
railroads
on
their
testimony,
that
the
face
amount
of
claim
is
to
cut
about
35%
or
40%
by
the
application
of
--
of
these
tolerances.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
can't
tell,
your
honor,
because
this
is
an
odd
sort
of
record
which
we
think
is
a
rather
deficient
finding.
here's
that
situation
to
see
in
new
york.
the
commission's
report
gives
no
suggestion
of
an
answer
to
that
(inaudible)
situation.
in
the
rest
of
the
country,
the
railroads
are
having
no
problem.
now,
if
you
authorize
a
tolerance
of
this
kind,
it
seems
to
us
that
you
encourage
the
railroads
all
over
the
country
and
the
truckers
because
they
will
be
included
next.
some
of
them
are
in
this
consolidated
freight
transportation,
now.
you
encourage
them
to
light
up
a
bit
on
how
careful
they
are
with
eggs
because
now
they
can
break
5%
of
them.
whereas
in
the
south,
the
west
and
the
southwest
they
haven't
been
breaking
any.
that
makes
no
difference.
they
can
eat
them.
and
it
makes
no
difference.
if
you
do
it
by
means
of
grades
and
continue
the
stringent
policy
of
the
common
law
as
codified
in
20
(11),
the
railroads
retain
their
incentive
to
find
out
why
they're
breaking
so
many
eggs.
now,
commissioner
mitchell
who
wrote
the
commissions
of
food,
at
the
hearing
where
the
court
presented
and
covering
a
period
of
over
a
year,
at
page
877
of
the
record
reflected
some
exasperation
that
perhaps
this
record
justifies.
he
said
at
record
877,
“i
think
the
railroads
ought
to
be
discovering
what
is
going
on
in
new
york.
god
knows
we've
been
trying
to
get
them
to
do
it.”
then
a
few
pages
later
at
884,
he
said,
“so
we
get
down,
don't
we,
to
a
question
of
what
shall
we
do
as
to
new
york
rather
than
shall
we
penalize
the
whole
nation.”
well,
commissioner
mitchell
never
got
any
answers
to
his
question
before
this
report
showed.
and
for
reasons
that
we
can't
explain,
the
report
he
wrote
to
the
commission
does
penalize
the
whole
nation
for
a
situation
concentrated
in
new
york.
now,
that
seems
to
us
to
be
an
unreasonable
solution
of
the
problem.
it's
not
the
kind
of
solution
the
commission
is
set
up
to
reach.
it
doesn't
promote
a
wise
transportation
policy.
it
doesn't
get
at
the
important
problem
that
shippers
and
carriers
alike
are
concerned
with,
why
are
all
these
eggs
breaking?
everybody
knows
apart
from
this
record
that
eggs
can
be
carried
without
being
broken.
they
have
bounced
along
in
trucks
without
being
broken.
they
were
carried
in
trucks
and
trains
before
1941
without
being
broken.
these
inevitabilities
and
inherent
damages
and
averages
were
no
problem
before
194.
and
they
are
no
problem
now,.except
in
new
york.
now,
we
think
that
apart
from
20
(11),
and
this
is
our
second
claim,
the
commission's
order
would
have
to
be
upset
because
the
findings
don't
support
it
--
don't
support
this
kind
of
nationwide
relaxation
of
carrier
liability.
and
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
oh.
well,
the
--
the
regulation
provides
--
let's
take
the
3%
tolerance.
there's
a
3%
to
5%.
the
regulation
provides
that
the
carrier
shall
not
be
liable
except
for
the
excess
over
3%
of
the
amount
of
eggs
in
the
cases
containing
damage.
you
can
take
the
total
number
of
eggs
in
the
cases
showing
damage
and
3%
percent
of
that
is
cut
off.
carrier
is
in
no
case
liable
for
that.
now,
usually
shipments
are
not
(inaudible)
the
shipper
consignee
will
be
claiming
5%,
6%,
7%,
10%
of
the
damage,
of
the
contents
to
the
damaged
eggs
as
his
loss
which
is
entitled
to
recovering.
now,
let's
suppose
he
claimed
6%
and
that
he
claims
for
6%
on
$200.
now
the
tolerance
is
3%.
so,
you
cut
it
in
half
and
you
cut
off
$50
of
it.
and
the
railroads
experience
has
shown
that
the
effects
of
the
5%
tolerance
is
to
cut
without
consideration
of
liability,
the
base
amount
of
claims
some
35%
to
40%.
and
in
some
studies
more
than
that.
so,
what
we
say
is
that
the
findings
doesn't
support
the
order
in
anyway.
and
that
this
use
of
the
averages
to
cover
every
case
regardless
of
what
the
shipper
can
show
is
unlawful.
it
stamps
the
rule
of
section
20
(11)
and
the
common
law
rule
that's
codified
on
its
head
instead
of
leaving
the
burden
upon
the
carrier
to
show
an
accepted
cause
for
which
he
is
not
responsible.
it
says
the
shipper,
not
only
will
we
presume
that
that
cause
has
been
shown
conclusively,
but
no
matter
what
you
show,
you
can't
recover
above
any
--
for
anything
below
3%
or
5%.
and
of
that
we
say
may
rightly
reflect
the
problem
that
can
--
can
be
solved
by
rate.
it
can't
be
solved
by
this
kind
of
tolerance
because
this,
we
submit,
is
an
unlawful
limitation
of
liability.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right.
it
doesn't
bring
the
burden
on
the
shipper.
except
that
you
describe
as
a
burden
and
insurmountable
one.
the
shipper,
no
matter
what
he
shows
can
never
recover
for
3%
or
5%
percent.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
it's
--
it's
very
difficult
for
me
--
for
me
to
read
these
regulations
as
providing
that.
it
says,
“no
claim
shall
be
allowed,
no
claim.”
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
think
there
may
be
ambiguity
for
this
before
its
construction.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
assuming
i
agreed,
i
would
still
argue
that
the
regulations
are
invalid.
but
i
think
in
fairness
to
our
understanding
that
it
says
i
also
have
to
emphasize
that
i
do
not
agree
that
under
these
regulations,
if
they
were
risked,
a
shipper
can
even
recover
if
he
shows
negligence.
at
least,
you'd
have
to
revise
them
and
--
and
make
sure
they
said
that
before
--
before
we'd
agree
what
they
do.
but
even
if
they
did,
we
say
that
since
the
carrier's
liability
going
way
back
and
certainly
under
section
20
(11)
is
much
broader
than
a
liability
from
mere
negligence.
tolerance
regulations
that
chop
that
liability
down
are
forbidden
by
20
(11).
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
can
i
ask
where
are
you,
sir?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
--
i
think
that
you
said
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
think
the
regulation
say
that.
i
don't
think
the
regulation
say
that.
they
say,
“no
claim
shall
be
allowed,
period.”
but
let
me
accept
that
as
a
gloss
on
the
regulations
an
odd
way
to
get
a
gloss
for
carrier
regulations.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
accepting
it
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
egg
shippers
don't
always
have
a
lawyer
at
hand
when
they've
lost
$25
on
a
shipment
a
day.
the
record
showed
that
in
considering
claims
for
egg
damage,
the
railroads
operating
under
these
tolerances
have
been
chopping
off
the
tolerance
percentages
all
over
time
without
considering
it.
now,
it
maybe
that
if
the
egg
shippers
can
periodically
get
the
course
they
can
have
this
clause
enforced.
it
has
not
been
enforced.
and
then
i
would
add
that
even
if
it
is
rated
to
the
regulations,
we
insist
on
the
dominion
and
long
standing
standard
of
carrier
liability
which
--
of
which
the
wisdom
is
demonstrated
by
this
court's
repeated
decision.
and
we
argue
the
fact
standard
is
violated
by
these
regulations.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
87%.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
the
court
please.
it's
in
our
situation,
are
friends
pending
the
commission
seem
less
happy
with
its
findings
than
we
are.
on
this
question
of
truck
damage,
is
this
--
are
we
talking
about
damage
as
reflected
in
claims
or
damage
as
reflected
in
damage?
now,
the
commission
found,
i
read
from
the
record
of
39.
the
record
indicates
that
in
the
transportation
of
eggs
by
motor
truck,
the
amount
of
shell
damage
is
negligible.
and
that's
based
on
eight
shippers
who
said
they
--
the
eggs
came
in
on
trucks
and
there
was
no
damage.
now,
we
accessed
that
finding.
and
we
think
that
they
must.
there
are
similar
findings
in
the
record
about
plain
damage.
the
shell
damage
is
negligible.
and
that
simply
that
some
people
make
claims
and
other
people
are
generous
to
the
truckers
or
what
not
and
don't
make
claims.
the
commission
expressly
rejected
that
suggestion
which
--
which
is
revived
here.
what
we're
talking
about
is
shell
damage
as
reflected
in
broken
eggs
and
claims.
they're
not
simply
as
an
inference
from
who
files
claims
and
who's
generous
and
who
doesn't.
now,
our
friends
have
argued
that
this
tolerance
regulation
ought
to
be
upheld
because
all
it
does
is
relieve
them
from
paying
the
damage
for
which
they're
not
liable.
now,
they
don't
need
a
regulation,
i
believe,
in
--
from
paying
for
damage
for
which
they're
not
liable.
although
it
does
that
for
them.
now,
they
say
this
does
it
in
a
uniform
way.
well,
this
as
i
think,
the
chief
justice
suggested
is
an
arbitrary
and
procrustean
kind
of
uniformity,
achieved
by
treating
things
that
are
in
fact
various
as
though
they
were
all
the
same.
now
we
are
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
that's
the
difficulty
that
all
lawyers
face
and
some
are
thankful
for
because
it
makes
them
busy
men.
but
the
fact
is
the
railroads
say
it's
hard
for
us
to
prove
in
any
case
that
we're
not
liable.
so,
here,
we
announce
the
regulation
that
proves
in
every
case
that
we're
not
liable.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
--
i
think
this
is
of
no
help
to
them,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
forbidden
solution.
now,
we're
not
talking
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
the
question,
your
honor.
and
i,
of
course,
spend
my
time
here
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
asserting
our
answer.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
now,
all
of
these
is
based
on,
your
honor,
is
not
a
law
of
chemistry
or
physics.
as
the
commission
says
exclusively
in
this
report,
this
is
a
rule
based
on
averages.
now,
you
could
strike
an
average
with
respect
to
almost
any
kind
of
commodity.
if
you
look
at
page
25
of
the
record,
you'll
find
that
the
railroads
break
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
with
for
some
reason
a
great
deal
of
sewer
pipe
tool.
now,
you
could
get
experts
to
come
in
and
tell
about
the
average
amount
of
sewer
pipe
or
(inaudible)
or
automobiles
or
what
not
that
gets
broken
for
which
the
railroads
are
not
responsible.
and
i
take
it
there
is
such
an
average
somewhere
in
the
world.
and
then
on
that
basis,
in
terms
of
the
arguments
our
friends
made,
you
would
have
an
average.
and
then
you
would
have
the
basis
for
a
rule
and
for
uniformity.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
not
permissible
under
section
20
(11).
now,
if
--
i
--
i
should
add
this.
that
what
you're
dealing
with
here,
after
all,
is
a
problem
simply
of
fragility.
eggs
are
fragile.
tea
cups
are
fragile.
for
some
reason,
sewer
pipe
seems
to
be
fragile.
and
it's
clear
as
i've
emphasized
with
both
the
trucks
and
the
railroads,
that
fragile
eggs
fragile
tea
cups
get
broken
to
some
extent
but
also
don't
get
broken
to
a
large
extent.
if
you
sanction
this
unprecedented
effort,
then
i
can
see
no
reason
why
would
sewer
pipes,
tea
cups
and
everything
in
the
world,
there
should
not
be
similar
tolerance
regulations
based
upon
averages.
now,
that's
never
been
done.
as
to
the
suggestion
of
a
settled
administrative
practice
it
will
of
become
the,
as
a
government
lawyer
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
giving
weight
to
the
administrative
practice
if
there
is
one.
there
isn't
any
here.
the
egg
case
in
1919,
was
a
case
where
the
railroads
proposed
general
tolerance
regulations
for
egg.
the
commission
was
asked
by
the
shippers
to
strike
them
down
as
unreasonable
with
no
mention
of
section
20
(11).
on
that
ground
alone,
unreasonable
then,
the
commission
struck
down
those
regulations
with
one
narrow
and
totally
unimportant
exception.
that
exception
was
the
so-called
current
receipts
which
are
run
to
the
next
case
as
they
come
from
the
farmer
without
sorting,
there's
a
certain
number
of
broken,
cracked
and
otherwise
damaged
eggs.
as
to
this,
you
will
see
in
the
commissions'
report
the
shippers
"practically
conceded"
that
the
5%
tolerance
rule
would
be
reasonable.
and
reasonableness
was
only
issue
they
had
raised.
in
other
words,
they
in
effect,
stipulated
for
a
5%
tolerance
as
the
current
decision.
this
record
show
to
us
current
receipts
aren't
shipped
commercially.
they
are
wholly
on
import.
the
shippers
didn't
care
about
it.
they
won
the
case.
because
as
all
other
eggs
which
are
shipped
commercially,
the
commission
then
found
that
such
a
tolerance
rule
would
be
unreasonable.
now,
there's
only
one
case
in
the
commission,
only
one.
and
that
is
the
case
involving
grain
tolerance
ruling
in
41
i.c.c.where
section
20
(11)
is
even
mentioned.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
i
discussed
the
possible
bearing
of
our
argument
in
that
rule
and
i
won't
repeat
it,
except
to
say
that
that
is
the
single
instance
in
which
the
commission
has
approved
a
tolerance
rule
over
the
contention
that
it
was
forbidden
by
section
20
(11).
now,
that
decision
seems
to
have
caused
nobody
any
trouble.
it's
never
been
reviewed
and
appears
to
be
unimportant.but
that's
the
only
case
that
counsel
on
either
side
has
found,
that
discusses
20
(11)
with
all
the
way
to
where
it
narrowly
accorded
to
settle
the
administrative
practice.
we
think
that
this
isolated
and
unrevealed,
apparently
unimportant
decision,
doesn't
come
up
to
the
standard
that
should
be
impressive
to
this
court.
i
want
to
ask
you
to
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan.
what
justifies
the
2%
difference
between
eggs
shipped
from
railpoint
of
origin
and
egg
shipped
from
elsewhere,
all
right?
we
read
the
findings,
nothing
does.
the
commission
found
that
the
practices
of
shippers
are
uniform.
that
in
truck
transportation,
damage
is
negligible.
that
the
egg
packed
away
from
the
railpoint
of
origin
are
truck
to
the
railpoint
of
origin.
in
this,
we
can
find
no
basis
with
the
2%
tolerance.
we
think
the
commission's
only
findings
require
that
it
be
rejected.
finally,
in
answer
to
the
point
discussed
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
by
mr.
zearfaus,
my
information
although
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record
today,
is
the
serious
little
litigation
over
these
claims.
and
before
they
introduced
these
regulations
to,
as
we
see
it,
limit
their
liability,
the
carriers
were
in
many
cases
paying
them.
and
exhibit
35
shows
that
they
don't
regard
this
as
being
a
problem
with
uniformity.
instead,
they
find
themselves
perfectly
able
to
determine
in
many
cases
that
one
thing
or
another,
one
thing
different
from
another,
caused
the
damage
in
any
particular
shipment.
they
thought
their
own
report
at
page
1167
of
the
records
shows
that
between
1939
and
1948,
when
these
damage
claims
were
rising,
the
damage
caused
the
eggs
from
improper
handling
in
trains'
yards
or
stations,
increased
15
times.
this
is
their
own
statistics
that
damage
caused
by
defective
(inaudible)
equipment
increased
eight
times.
that
damage
cause
by
improper
refrigeration
or
ventilation
increased
34
times.
now,
they
have
apparently,
in
paying
these
claims
on
the
basis
that
they
are
able
to
make
the
particular
individual
determinations
in
particular
cases.
the
rule
now,
that
regardless
of
what
they
determine
and
regardless
what
the
shipper
shows,
they
are
absolutely
not
liable
for
3%
or
5%
of
the
damage
or
1%
plus
this
very
questionable
certificate
showing.
that
rule,
we
think,
is
--
is
just
inconsistent
with
section
20(11).
thank
you.
