mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wonder
if
that
the
exemption
of
my
argument
would
be
good
enough
referred
to
my
brief.
i's
one
of
the
white
briefs.
and
particularly
to
the
regulations
which
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
it's
the
one
of
the
white
ones.
i'm
sorry
i
asked
printer
to
give
a
different
color
but
he
didn't.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes
sir.
(inaudible)
and
would
you
be
good
enough
to
refer
to
page
61
down
at
the
bottom,
particularly
referring
to
section
6.
and
these
are
the
regulations
which
the
commission
approved
and
which
now
formed
the
subject
of
a
tariff
which
is
on
file
with
the
commission
and
which
is
in
effect
today.
and
they
already
attack
the
regulation.section
6
on
eggs
placed
in
packages
at
rail
point
of
origin
of
the
shipment,
no
claim
shall
be
allowed
with
the
physical
damage
to
the
egg
at
destination
does
not
exceed
3%
of
the
contents
of
the
package
pertaining
damaged
eggs.
where
damage
exceed
3%,
claims
shall
be
allowed
for
all
damages
in
excess
of
3%
percent
if
investigation
develops
carrier
liability.
now,
we
proceed
to
exception
where
bona
fide
certificates
of
federal
or
state
egg
inspection
agencies
showing
extent
of
physical
damage
to
eggs
determined
at
rail
point
of
origin
of
the
shipment
immediately
prior
to
tender
for
rail
transportation
indicate
the
actual
shell
damage
to
be
other
than
2%,
the
percentage
of
actual
damage
as
shown
on
such
certificates,
plus
1%
shall
be
used
in
lieu
of
3%
specified
in
this
section."
now,
the
point
i
want
to
make
in
connection
with
that
is
that
no
shipment
has
to
accept
the
2%
origin
damage.
if
he
wants
to,
he
may
give
to
the
railroad
a
federal
or
state
egg
inspection
certificate
and
we
will
take
that
percentage
as
shown
in
that
certificate
and
add
1%
for
the
transit
damage
about
which
i
shall
speak
later
and
that
will
be
the
amount
which
he's
claimed
will
be
reduced.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
$11
for
cases
in
that
--
of
301
for
$400
up
to
400,
$15
for
401
to
600
cases.
i
would
say
approximately
$15
per
car,
because
i
imagine
they
load
around
$400,
i
mean
400
cases
per
car.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes.
i
imagine
that
would
be
about
a
fair
statement.
and
in
addition
to
that,
i
might
state
this
point
that
the
testimony
from
the
witness,
one
of
the
witnesses
from
the
department
of
agriculture
was
to
the
effect
that
if
the
shippers
wanted
this
service
throughout
the
nation,
that
the
department
could
furnish
them.
they're
about
to
employ
a
number
of
inspectors
but
they
--
there
is
a
self-sustaining
service
and
they
could
furnish
it,
so
it
has
no
question
about
that.
now,
the
point
i
want
to
make
particularly
is
this
that
this
damage,
this
origin's
damage
take
this
in
the
the
place
of
eggs
before
the
railroads
ever
get
them.
now,
that's
the
first
point.
and
the
second
point
is
that
in
connection
with
the
transit
damage,
it
is
our
contention
on
the
commission
so
found
that
there
is
always
a
certain
amount
of
transit
damage
due
to
the
inherent
nature
of
the
case,
the
fragility
of
the
shell
egg
and
the
fact
that
some
of
the
eggs
which
have
been
damaged
may
leak
and
therefore
wet
the
fillers
and
cracks
and
that
will
cause
additional
damage
during
transportation.
that
is
the
damage
that
we
want
to
get
out
of
a
damage
claim.
its
damage
for
which
the
railroads
are
not
responsible
under
any
circumstances
at
common
law
or
any
law.
no
one
would
be
responsible
for
damage
which
was
in
a
consignment
or
a
package
before
they
ever
received
them.
and
insofar
as
the
inherent
nature
is
concerned,
the
inherent
nature
is
one
of
the
four
common
law
exceptions
to
a
common
carriers'
liability.
and
that's
what
we
want
to
get
out
of
these
egg
claims.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes.
and,
i
want
first
to
point
out
to
you,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
the
testimony
for
the
most
part
came
from
witnesses
for
the
department
of
agriculture.
we
made
studies
of
our
own
and
that
the
two
dovetail.
they
both
fit.
the
testimony
that
i
have
mentioned
here
in
my
brief
is
from
a
mr.
hyman,
chief
of
the
dairy
and
poultry
inspection
in
grading
division
of
the
--
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture.
now,
i'm
wrong
about
hyman.
it's
mr.
miller,
he
is
--
he's
the
chief
of
the
research
department.
if
you
will
refer
to
pages
23
and
24
of
my
brief,
you
will
find
the
--
that
if
a
particularly
at
23
and
down
going
through
the
testimony
as
to
these
that
upon
which
the
commission
based
its
findings.
the
department
took
150
--
150
carloads
of
eggs.
they
had
them
inspected
at
point
of
origin.
and
they
followed
them
through
to
destination.
and
that
in
connection
with
those,
you
will
find
the
study
of
the
--
of
the
115
cases
at
the
top
of
page
24
of
my
brief.
it
refers
to
exhibit
number
22
in
the
record
and
is
at
page
1130
of
the
record.
the
stained
and
dirties
were
one
decimal
four,
the
checks
for
one
decimal
nine
and
the
loss
that
is
the
leakers
and
cracked
and
so
forth
was
one-tenth
of
1%
making
a
total
of
three
decimal
4%.
now,
this
same
witness
conducted
another
investigation
with
respect
to
737
other
cars.
and
he
found
that
practically
substantiated
what
he
had
learned
from
the
first.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
the
--
the
witness
ascertain
--
that
is,
made
a
comparison
of
what
the
damage
was,
that
there
were
115
cars
at
destination
as
contrasted
with
what
they
were
at
point
of
origin.
and
he
came
up
with
the
difference
of
additional
damage
of
one
decimal
7%.
and
i
might
state
that
those
eggs
were
all
examined
in
the
same
way
at
both
ends
of
the
movement.
they
were
both
--
there
were
candled
at
origin,
they
were
candled
at
destination.
now,
there
was
something
said.
please
refer
to
advice
of
our
opponents
here.
that
the
inspection
at
destination
is
not
a
casual
inspection.
we're
not,
as
matter
of
fact,
the
witness
from
the
department
that
refuse
to
say
that
it
wasn't
--
that
it
was
an
--
an
inspection
that
was
just
sort
of
a
casual
thing.
i'd
like
read
to
yous
from
page
338
of
the
record.
question
-
in
other
words,
the
inspection
for
damage
is
not
as
rigid
as
an
inspection
--
as
the
creating
inspection?
answer
-
i
wouldn't
say
it
wasn't
his
region,
that
bridge
of
mr.
madison,
i
would
say
it
does
not
go
into
as
much
detail
from
the
standpoint
of
the
determinations
made.
now,
the
commission
also
mentioned
that
with
respect
to
the
inspection
at
new
york.
it
said
that
certainly
the
inspection
at
new
york
is
being
performed
with
the
view
of
affecting
all
damaged
eggs.
and
the
result
certainly
showed
that.
as
the
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
you're
probably
right
sir.
but
i
--
i
was
interrogated
from
the
bench
and
i
thought
maybe
i
had
to
go
through
with
it.
that
is,
it
is
a
fact
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
that
this
--
that
there
is
substantial
justification
for
the
figures.
but
then
that
other
thing,
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
is
this
particular
point
which
justifies
our
contention
and
supports
the
commission
and
its
statement
that
this
1%
damage
is
a
damage
which
you
may
expect.
mr.
hyman
about
whom
i
referred
before
and
who
testified
for
the
department
of
agriculture
stated
that
it
was
humanly
impossible
to
handle
eggs
without
some
damage.
now,
here
is
a
colloquy
appearing
at
page
343
of
the
record
between
mr.
hyman's
counsel.
this
question
that
said,
asked,
you
say
that
it
is
impossible
to
eliminate
every
check
in
cracked
eggs
from
the
case
of
eggs
in
the
process
of
creating
eggs?
yes,
sir.
and
then
later,
question
-
you
pointed
out
it
was
humanly
impossible
or
at
least
impractical
to
pack
a
perfect
car
--
you
have
never
seen
a
perfect
car
have
you?
no,
i
haven't.
question
-
then
there
was
a
normal
expectancy
of
shell
damage
in
every
car
that
is
loaded.
is
there
not?
now,
the
point
before
to
add
about
this
is
that
the
impression
seems
to
be
that
--
that
there
are
some
perfect
shipments
of
eggs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
department
of
agriculture
itself
allows
a
certain
amount
of
tolerance
in
connection
with
the
various
grades
of
eggs.
for
the
double
a
grade,
i
believe
they
allow
about
11%
and
for
the
so-called
a
grade
about
7.5%.
now,
that
takes
in
for
all
types
of
damages
and
so
forth.
it
takes
in
--
in
connection
with
the
double
a
as
i
understand
it
about
5%
checks
that
is,
the
shell
is
broken,
but
the
membrane
is
still
intact.
so,
you
see
that
what
we
have
done
and
what
the
commission
has
approved
is
nothing
more
than
what
the
trade
itself
does
and
what
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
does.
we
try
to
make
something
which
is
in
conformity
with
the
trade
practices
and
with
what
the
government
itself
designed.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
i
don't
think
--
that's
true.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
increase
in
rate
takes
into
account
damage
where
which
the
railroad
is
not
responsible.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
it
takes
into
account
the
hazard
that
the
railroad
has
because
it's
got
something
which
through
its
negligence,
it
might
break.
but
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
sir,
between
what
the
insurance
is
in
the
rate
on
one
hand
as
for
the
railroad's
negligent
handling
or
the
railroad's
liability
even
under
its
common
law
liability
on
the
one
hand
as
contrasted
with
railroads
being
held
liable
for
something
that
you
did
before.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
that
hazard
of
transportation
is
a
factor
in
making
a
rate,
yes.
but
i
don't
--
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
damage
raising
the
rate
for
damage
for
which
you
cannot
be
held
responsible
either
at
common
law
or
something
for
which
you
wouldn't
be
liable
as
in
the
case
like
this
where
the
damage
exists
before
you
get
it.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
that's
right.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
we
try
to
get
that
up
to
this.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
we
probably
could.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
we
could
probably
would
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
this,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this.
that
we
have
lost
practically
all
of
the
egg
business.
and
the
reasons
which
the
shippers
give
us
on
this
record
are
these.
first,
that
the
rates
are
lower
and
they
give
refrigeration
service
for
which
we
make
an
extra
charge.
and
then
secondly,
they
say
they
have
less
trouble
with
the
--
their
claims
on
one
hand
but
--
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
--
people
on
the
west
coast
indicated
that
it
was
sort
of
a
give
and
take
proposition.
they
helped
us
and
we
helped
them.
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
explanations
as
to
why
we
don't
have
these
claims
in
connection
with
the
trucks.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
well,
some
of
these
carriers
are
exempt
carriers,
some
are
contract
carriers
and
they'll
do
a
little
favor
for
a
fellow
that
might
work
late,
a
little
late
some
nights
and
make
a
delivery.
and
therefore,
if
this
driver
when
unloading
the
crates
happens
to
drop
one
of
the
"forget
it
john"
you
helped
us.
and
they're
not
going
to
bother
with
it.
that
was
one
of
the
explanations
that
we
received
in
connection
with
the
--
the
hearing
out
of
los
angeles.
now,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
to
say
that
i
can't
tell
you
why
the
claims
in
connection
with
the
truck
business
are
negligible.
in
fact,
there
are
claims.
the
record
shows
there
are
claims,
but
they
also
--
a
shipper,
the
shippers
also
contend
that
they
are
negligible
in
contrast
with
ours.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
that
one
fellow
gave
was
that
he
had
trouble
getting
paid.
i
mean,
why
bother
with
it,
apparently.
i
don't
know.
but
then
i
say
it
is
all
pretty
much
a
matter
of
conjecture
and
the
--
and
the
record
is
that
they're
helpful
in
connection
with
that
face
of
the
matter.
and
i
don't
think,
i
don't
want
to
enter
--
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
let
me
give
you
this
further
point
which
i
promise
you
to
give
you
in
the
first
instance.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
i
suppose
there
are
hundreds
and
literally
thousands
of
shippers
who
don't
file
claims
for
damage
in
connection
with
eggs
which
existed
at
the
time
that
eggs
were
tended
for
rail
transportation.
now,
if
we
raised
the
rates
on
the
shipments
of
those
fellows
who
look
at
it
let
us
say
from
a
fair
standpoint
and
don't
do
like
some
of
this
consignees
do
at
new
york
city
and
take
(inaudible)
smashed
or
cracked
egg
that
they
can
find.
it
isn't
fair
to
the
fellow
who
wants
treat
us
fair
to
raise
his
rate
because
somebody
else
does
something
else.
and
i
think
that
is
a
conclusive
and
good
explanation
of
why
would
we
shouldn't
increase
the
rates
even
if
we
could.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
i
think
as
to
him,
he's
--
he
is
in
the
position
that
insofar
as
he
is
concerned,
the
public
good
as
to
the
--
he
has
to
deploy
to
the
public
term.
now,
let
me
discuss
that
phase
of
it
a
little
bit.
first
of
all,
judge
powell
said
to
you,
"the
railroads
are
permitted
to,
even
at
common
law,
to
make
the
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
with
respect
to
receipt
of
freight.
so
that
fraud
and
imposition
won't
be
imposed
upon
him.
at
section
1,
paragraph
6,
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
admonished
the
railroads
to
do
that
very
thing.
section
15,
paragraph
1,
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
gave
the
interstate
commerce
commission
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
those
rules,
regulations
and
practices
were
just
and
reasonable.
and
then
you
go
to
the
section
2
of
the
act
and
you'll
find
that
(inaudible)
shall
not
be
guilty
of
unjust
discrimination.
section
3
say,
you
shall
not
be
guilty
of
undue
prejudice
or
preference.
now,
all
of
those
things
to
my
mind
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
the
provisions
of
section
20
(11)
of
the
act.
because
the
interpretation
which
we
ask
you
to
place
upon
section
20
paragraph
11
of
the
act
will
do
away
with
discrimination.
it
will
do
away
with
prejudice.
it
will
assist
us,
the
railroads,
in
getting
away
from
making
involuntary
rebates
and
it
will
result
in
uniformity.
and
as
a
consequence,
something
which
has
been
justified
by
a
record
such
as
this
one
here
of
thousands
of
pages
in
applied
hearings
hours
of
hours
both
interstate
commerce
commission
and
this
board
of
experts
certainly
ought
to
be
given
credence
and
certainly
you
want
to
have
the
benefit
of
what
was
done
there.
so
that
every
time
some
shipper
of
eggs
has
lawsuit
against
this,
we
may
not
be
compelled
to
go
into
court,
and
endeavor
to
prove
the
same
type
of
thing
that
we
too,
we
hope
once
for
all
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
no,
it
is
but
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
i
say
we
did
but
and
probably
not
so
many
now
since
we
don't
get
too
much
of
the
business.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
but
the
fact
that
is
in
your
question.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
so,
we're
not
going
to
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
well,
this
way.
now,
let
me
refer
you
to
the
so-called
watermelon
cases
which
were
tried
in
philadelphia
some
years
ago.
their
suits
were
dropped
for
damage
to
shipments
of
watermelon.
and
the
railroads
introduced
testimony
to
experts
that
there
is
always
a
certain
number
of
watermelons
that
are
broken
during
the
course
of
transportation.
and
the
question
was
then
less
--
left
before
the
court
whoever
was
tried
without
a
jury
went
to
court
with
the
jury
while
it
was
described
without
a
jury,
as
to
what
--
what
the
normal
expectancy
of
breakage
of
watermelons
moving
in
such
distances.
one
judge
will
say
one
thing.
another
judge
will
say
another.
and
now
the
jury
will
say
another.
it's
just
like
the
question
of
rates.
when
that
of
course
made
the
administrative
tribunal,
established
the
rates
and
passed
upon
their
determination.
one
jury
could
say
one
thing
at
being
a
jury
the
question
of
common
law,
what
was
to
unreasonable
and
what
was
the
reasonable
rate.
one
jury
would
say
one
thing.
another
would
say
another.
the
administrative
body
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission
gives
the
uniformity.
it
gives
the
uniformity
with
respect
to
the
problem
itself.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
that's
right.
that's
true.
now,
the
very
point
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
the
question
--
the
question
is
who's
going
to
know
what
the
breakage
is
unless
they
give
us
the
state
or
federal
inspection
certificate.
at
the
point
of
origin
is
the
time
that
we
should
be
told
what
is
the
condition
of
the
consignment.
we
accept
the
consignment
in
appearance
with
order
of
the
condition,
contents
in
tradition
if
contents
are
unknown.
but
they
don't
have
too
hard
at
job
to
--
to
establish
before
a
jury
that
the
condition
was
excellent
and
there
was
nothing
with
that
thing.
but
what
we
hope
to
do
here
is
to
establish
what
we
know
to
be
the
fact
that
there
is
some
damages
here.
and
to
avoid
necessity
in
every
lawsuit
of
attempting
to
establish
what
is
the
normal
expectancy
of
breakage
of
eggs.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
my
impression
is
the
claim
to
pay.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes.
as
to
its
relation.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
no,
they
wouldn't,
sir.
you'd
probably
participate
in
order
for
him
to
establish
the
ordinary
claim
of
the
amount
of
damage
then
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
they're
numbered.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
oh,
i
think
that's
pretty
well
--
or
pretty
well
scattered
in
new
york
city
area.
i
think
so.
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
i
don't
know.
i
can't
say
as
a
matter
of
fact.
so,
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
it.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
what
i
understand
it's
charged
in
new
york
city
as
contrast
to
charge.
do
you
remember?
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
have
seen
in
it
in
the
record?
mr.
frankel
was
concerned
enough
to
direct
my
attention
to
page
27
of
the
record.
you
will
find
that
on
page
27
(inaudible)
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
(inaudible)
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
that's
right.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
no
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
i
think
it
comes
mostly
from
indiana,
wisconsin,
out
in
the
mid-west
section.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
i
don't
think
that's
the
reason
why
they
came
by
truck.
i
think
they
come
from
the
mid-west
section.
mostly,
the
traffic
comes
from
there.
in
connection
with
this
interpretation
which
we
placed
upon
section
20,
paragraph
11
of
the
act,
i'd
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
certain
things
which
we
feel
justifies
the
--
the
interpretation
which
we
do
place
upon.
the
submission
as
far
back
as
1916,
i
believe,
and
probably
before
that
passed
upon
how
it
answers
in
connection
with
shipments
of
grain.
and
it
had
practically
before
the
same
type
of
questions
which
are
raised
here
today,
limitations
and
liability,
depriving
a
man
of
jury
trial
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
passed
them
by
and
describe
certain
limitations
in
connection
with
shipments
of
grain.
and
then
in
1919,
in
connection
with
this
(inaudible)
situation
they
prescribed
a
tolerance
of
5%
in
connection
with
eggs
which
were
known
as
currently
(inaudible)
are
the
eggs
that
come
directly
from
the
nest
to
the
market.
now,
we
think
that
the
settled
administrative
construction
over
such
a
long
period
of
time
well
over
14
years
is
entitled
to
wait.
and
we
also
think
this
that
section
20,
paragraph
11
act
was
amended
seven
times
since
those
cases
were
cited.
and
while
it
was
amended,
those
seven
times
congress
even
though
these
cases
were
reported
to
it
by
the
commission
in
its
annual
report
to
congress,
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
make
any
changes
in
connection
with
this
phase
of
section
20
paragraph
11
which
is
under
consideration
here
today.
and
we
think
that
that
is
entitled
to
wait
in
considering
the
interpretation
of
that
section
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
range
--
the
range?
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
weighing
tolerances
in
connection
with
the
shipments
called
where
they
have
a
water
content
and
the
water
sips
through
during
the
course
of
transportation.
i
can't
recall
any
other.
i
don't
know
if
there's
gasoline,
but
i
can't
recall
it.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
i
think
it
is.
i
think
that
there
is.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
of
what
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
but
don't
we
do
that
here?
we
do
that
here.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
we
do
that
here,
except
that's
to
transfer
them.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes,
any
shipper
that
comes
to
us
with
a
certificate
and
shows
that
he's
got
1%
or
one
half
of
1%
damage
as
to
point
of
origin,
that
will
be
taken
in
consideration.
and
that
total
will
be
deducted
from
his
rate
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
--
except
for
the
transportation
that
the
(inaudible)
does,
regardless
of
what
it
is.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
regardless
to
what
it
might
be.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
then
we'll
add
1%.
everybody
had
to
take
at
1%.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
the
foundation
for
that
is
based
upon
the
studies
made
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
by
the
railroads
that
when
the
eggs
reached
destination
there
is
that
much
more
damage
and
that
if
they
do
--
due
to
unreasonable
thing.
now,
i
might
mention
in
connection
with
the
army,
the
army
which
is
one
of
the
litigants
here
proposing
this
sort
of
thing.
they
have
a
protection
with
their
eggs
for
export.
they
allow
3%
tolerance
at
the
point
of
origin
and
4.5%
tolerance
with
destination
when
they
purchase
them
from
their
vendees--
the
vendors.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
no,
they're
not
correct.
that's
the
point.
they
--
they
won't
--
they
--
they
will
take
as
good
order
shipments
of
eggs.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes,
that's
3%
of
origin,
4.5%
destination.
now,
there's
something
else
i
do
want
to
mention
before
i
conclude
my
argument.
and
that
is
in
connection
with
off
rail
certificate.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
our
testimony
there
is
not
as
complete
as
the
other.
i
think
we've
got
enough
to
substantiate
what
the
commission
has
found.
the
fact
is
that
according
to
the
record,
witness
miller
and
this
was
the
man
from
the
department
of
agriculture
said
this
at
page
365
of
the
record.
"these
two
studies,
i
think,
will
show
rather
clearly
at
approximately
4%
of
the
eggs
as
delivered
by
producers
and
sold
to
the
first
buyers
are
in
a
check
condition.
and
that
an
additional
1%
was
worth
of
check
while
traveling
from
the
first
buyer
to
the
second
buyer."
this
would
mean
that
when
mid-western
eggs
arrived
with
the
carload
assemblers
of
the
plant
in
mid
west
area
states,
or
reached
wholesale
as
in
the
northeast,
approximately
5%
of
them
would
be
checked.
then
there
are
--
there
are
also
further
place
in
his
testimony
where
he
said
they
would
also
be
in
those
eggs
about
12%
of
stains
and
dirties.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
this
statement
by
the
witness
from
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange.
he
doesn't
just
say
how
many
members
were
--
were
confirmed
as
a
member
for
that
exchange
but
they
are
the
dealers
in
dairy
products.
and
in
the
old
case
which
judge
powell
referred
to
many
years
ago
where
he
said
they
represented
500
dairy
sellers
in
the
state
--
in
the
city
of
new
york.
but
this
gentleman,
mr.
winters,
testified
at
page
634
of
the
record
this
way.
please
let
me
--
if
you
please,
let's
read
this
colloquy
between
commissioner
mitchell
and
the
witness.
mr.
mitchell,
"you
say
today
you
would
rather
have
your
eggs
shipped
to
you
that
are
rehandled
and
repacked
at
the
railway
because
they
come
in
a
better
condition.
is
that
the
reason?"
the
witness,
"we
feel
so,
yes.
we
don't
want
any
factors
to
enter
into
the
field
that
might
damage
the
eggs,
any
extra
handling."
in
other
words,
i
suppose
you
mean
that
somebody
packed
these
packs
of
the
eggs,
puts
them
on
a
truck
and
transfers
them
20
miles
of
the
railway."
mr.
mitchell,
"i
mean
eggs
that
are
not
repacked
or
rehandled
at
the
railway.
the
witness,
"we
try
not
to
handle
those
kind
of
eggs."
mr.
mitchell,
"do
you
believe
that
trucking
of
eggs
150
to
200
miles
damage
the
eggs
any
extent?"
the
witness,
"there
is
always
hazard
that
an
extra
handling
will
damage
eggs."
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
well
i
--
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
no,
we
do
not
think
it
does.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
oh,
i
--
i
thought
i
did.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
provisions
of
section
20,
paragraph
11
as
i
should
have
read
in
injunction
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
and
the
interpretation
that
we
placed
upon
it,
we
think,
that
put
the
--
the
--
that
provision
in
a
--
in
a
situation
where
all
provisions
of
the
act
may
be
given
the
full
benefit
of
what
congress
intended
they
should
give
to
us.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
that
is
true.
yes
we
did.
that's
my
point.
mr.
william
f.
zearfaus
under
--
under
1
paragraph
6,
we
got
the
right
that
--
we're
asked
--
we're
opposed
to
it.
under
6
(1),
we're
told
to
make
regulations
which
are
necessary
for
them
to
see
which
way.
that's
the
act
reads.
and
also
our
tariff
under
section
6
of
the
tariff,
under
there
section
6
of
the
act.
well,
i
thank
you
very
much.
