what
difference
does
it
really
make
to
the
railroads
which
way
this
thing
goes?
because
if
they
have
to
pay
to
the
full
extent
without
tolerances,
if
they
are
without
any
tolerances,
it
surely
reflected
those
lost
payments
were
reflected
in
the
increase
of
rates.
what
difference
does
it
make
to
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about,
inherent
price.
i
suppose
it's
theoretically
possible
to
transfer
--
to
transport
eggs
without
breaking.
the
commission
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
found
it
was
done
in
trucks
for
example?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
ask
you
theoretically
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
the
conductors
on
the
railroad
cars
to
be
given
eggs
and
i
suppose
that
could
take
them
down
without
any
trouble
on
breakage.
and
doesn't
the
application
of
the
inherent
price
moves
of
eggs
pre-suppose
unlike
gasoline
there's
average
of
operating
for
example.
doesn't
it
pre-suppose
some
standard
which
the
railroad
having
followed
is
relieved
of
liability
for
as
it
measures
up
to
a
minimum
standard.
and
doesn't
that
vary
from
the
--
doesn't
that
impose
a
different
standard
in
the
common
law
rule
of
absolute
liability
subject
to
this
exceptions
on
which
is
in
inherent
advice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
your
tolerance
on,
on
rail
shipment
so-called,
is
3%
and
on
all
pre-shipment
is
shipment
is
5%.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
evidence
in
the
--
what
evidence
is
there
in
the
record
to
justify
that
difference
of
2%?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
couldn't
find
it.
