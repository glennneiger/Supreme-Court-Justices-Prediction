mr.
samuel
r.
howell
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
appellee
railroad
and
i
have
agreed
upon
a
division
of
the
argument.
i
shall
argue
the
issue
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
approve
the
tolerance
rules
that
are
here
on
appeal.
now,
the
--
the
damage
claim
problem
to
egg
is
not
a
new
problem.
it
didn't
just
arrive
during
world
war
ii,
when
this
counsel
says
that
there
was
a
source
of
equipment
and
they
were
overcrowding
the
cars,
but
this
is
a
problem
that
has
confronted
the
commission
for
over
40
years.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
back,
in
1911,
the
commission
conducted
an
investigation
involving
the
same
questions
that's
raised
here.
how
to
reduce
the
damage
claims
or
to
make
it
possible
for
the
railroad
to
--
to
avoid
having
to
pay
claims
on
property
that
it
didn't
damage.
and
that
was
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
company
versus
the
b&o
railway
decided
in
1911.
and
then
in
1919,
the
commission
again
considered
the
question
of
claims
on
damages
to
shelled
eggs.
and
that
was
the
case
of
the
national
poultry,
butter
and
egg
association
versus
the
b&o
railroad.
and
that's
reported
in
36
i.c.c.
and
there
it
prescribed
a
5%
tolerance
rule
which
is
--
is
--
which
is
very
similar
to
the
rule
that's
involved
in
this
case.
and
that
stood
the
test
of
time
until
1948
when
the
railroads
filed
another
(inaudible)
with
the
commission
and
--
and
proposed
to
change
that
rule
and
so
as
to
include
a
--
a
rule
that
would
cover
the
damage
that
occurred
during
transit
due
to
the
inherent
nature
of
these,
of
the
eggs
and
also
to
cover
the
pre-existing
damage
to
eggs
before
the
railroads
ever
receive
them.
now,
that
is
the
history
of
this
thing.
it
isn't
something
new.
the
carriers
that
applied
their
best
to
solve
this
problem
as
is
shown
in
the
commission's
decision.
and
the
commission's
found
that
despite
all
of
the
efforts
of
the
railroad
has
made
where
the
--
wherein
it
had
used,
made
test
--
tests
in
--
in
connection
with
the
unloading
of
the
eggs
in
the
cars,
putting
the
eggs,
placed
them
crosswise
and
lengthwise
and
there
were
other
sets
of
--
of
combination.
and
but
using
rubber
pads
for
bunkers
and
taping
the
eggs
together
with
--
with
adhesive
so
as
to
make
them
a
compact
unit
so
as
to
prevent
any
vibration
or
shaking
or
jolting
that
would
cause
them
to
break.
so,
the
--
the
commission
found
that
the
--
although
that
the
railroads
have
--
have
done
their
utmost
to
eliminate
damage
to
eggs
at
destination,
little
improvement
could
be
expected.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
but
your
honor
i
can
answer
that.
there
--
there
is
an
answer
to
it
and
the
commission
considered
that
problem.
no
matter
where
the
destination
of
the
egg
is,
there
is
always
the
same
amount
of
--
or
of
--
and
have
this
average
amount
of
5%
damage
existing
in
the
egg
crates
at
the
point
of
origin
where
those
eggs
have
been
packed
away
from
the
--
the
real
point
of
origin.
there
is
that
much
damage
pre-existing
in
those
eggs
before
the
carrier
ever
laid
his
hands
on
them
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
regardless
of
whether
they
went
east
or
west
or
north
or
south,
those
eight
days
damages
in
those
eggs,
crates
before
the
carrier
puts
his
hands
on
them.
and
therefore,
it
would
not
be
fair
and
just
for
the
carriers
to
continue
to
have
to
pay
damages
that
they
didn't
cause.
and
that's
exactly
what
these
rules
are
directed
against.
now,
as
to
the
truck
situation,
of
course,
we
dare
the
--
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
it's
in
the
record
or
not
but
the
--
the
trucks,
the
truck
--
truck
--
truck
transporters
i
believe
do
not
have,
they
call
as
rule.
they
--
they'd
operate
without
any
rules.
and
of
course,
it's
not
known
whether
the
--
that
the
companies
are
as
--as
fastidious
when
they're
shipping
eggs
by
truck
as
they
are
by
rail.
i
--
i
don't
know
that.
it's
not
in
the
--
in
the
record.
but
it's
--
of
course
we
have
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
if
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
the
--
i
--
i
don't
know
that
--
that
there's
anything
in
the
record
on
that,
your
honor.
but
i
was
trying
to
answer
the
questions
enough.
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor.
that
it's
(inaudible)
and
if
the
prices
were
raised
on
the
cost
of
shipping
eggs
by
rail
any
more
than
they
are
now,
there
would
not
be
an
egg
moved
by
then.
and
that
then,
so
the
raising
of
the
price
of
their
transportation
according
to
--
in
view
of
this
situation
here,
it
is
not
the
answer
to
the
problem.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
not
relative
to
our
purpose
anyway,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
your
honor,
you
know,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
the
difference
in
the
damage?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
oh.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
can
answer
that
question,
i
--
i
didn't
know
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
your
honor,
i
couldn't
have
account
that.
except
that
i
do
know
that
the
shippers
have
gone
to
the
trucks
for
two
or
three
reasons.
one
is
that
the
truck
can
come
to
the
shipper's
warehouse
and
pick
the
eggs
up
and
make
delivery
at
the
destination.
and
it's
more
convenient
to
the
shipper
to
use
the
trucks.
and
then
again,
the
-
the
freight
rates
fix
those
prices
involved.
there
the
trucks
handle
a
property
cheap
on
a
cheaper
rate
basis
than
do
the
railroads.
and
so,
the
--
that's
the
reason
why
that
the
traffic
has
gone
away
from
the
railroads
to
the
truck
line.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
but
if
your
honor
please.
the
answer,
i
think,
is
that
the
record
shows
that
there
are
less
damage
claims
filed
on
truck
shipments.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
filed.
yes,
your
honor
or
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
do
not
know
the
actual
physical
fact
of
that.
and
i
--
i
don't
know
that
it's
in
the
record,
the
counsel
for
(inaudible)
should
be
able
to
answer
that
then
he's
--
he's
specified.
now
the
--
the
real
question,
i
think
presented
here
is
when
there
is
pre-existing
damage
to
goods
delivered
to
our
railroad
and
when
kinds
of
damage
occurs
due
to
the
inherent
nature
to
goods
of
which
the
railroad
is
not
responsible,
does
the
commission
have
the
power
to
approve
a
regulation
designed
to
relieve
the
railroads
from
such
damage?
now,
of
course,
the
commission
does
have
that
power
and
it
is
to
be
found
in
section
1
(6)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
requires
the
railroads
in
the
first
instance
to
publish
reasonable
rules,
regulations
and
practices
designed
to
cover
the
--
the
delivery,
receipt,
the
transportation
and
the
--
the
handling
of
--
of
freights
--
of
freight.
and
section
15
(1)
empowers
the
commission
to
investigate
any
such
rule,
regulation
or
practice
as
is
filed
by
the
--
by
the
railroads
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
reasonable
and
just.
and
whether
or
not
they
are
unlawful.
and
if
the
commission
should
find
after
hearing
that
there
--
these
rules
and
regulations
are
unjust
and
unreasonable,
then
the
commission
is
--
is
enjoined
by
congress
to
establish
what
will
be
the
just,
reasonable,
rule
and
practice
to
be
followed.
now,
with
the
--
with
this
in
mind,
these
provisions
in
mind,
the
question
is
presented
whether
they
are
affected
by
the
provisions
of
section
20
(11),
particularly
the
clause
which
prohibit
the
carrier
from
limiting
his
liability
in
the
connection
with
the
safe
handling
of
freight.
now,
there
was
no
rule
at
common
law
in
the
first
place,
that
made
the
carrier
liable
for
damages
to
goods
which
the
carrier
didn't
cause.
and
in
order
for
that
damage
which
occurred
during
the
course
of
transportation
due
to
the
inherent
of
the
goods.
there
was
no
rule
like
that.
and
under
the
common
law
a
carrier
will
--
a
carrier,
of
course,
was
liable
as
counsel
has
said
as
an
insurer
for
the
safety
of
the
handling
of
the
property
except
for
the
--
an
act
of
god
and
the
public
enemy
and
--
and
the
acts
of
the
shipper
and
the
inherent
nature
of
the
goods.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
--
who
attends
to
--
well,
we
--
we
think
that
it
has.
i
--
still
--
doesn't
expressly
in
--
in
words.
well
in
--
not
in
--
in
words
(inaudible)
but
--
and,
of
course,
have
interpreted
the
end
--
the
end
to
the
statute.
now
section
20
(11)
and
merely
we
state
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
into
the
general
statutes,
sir.
or
maybe
there's
--
maybe
this
statute.
in
a
--
in
a
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
would
be
in
the
general
statutes
but
i
am
sure
that
courts
have
interpreted
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
and
that
--
that's
the
--
to
answer
the
question
of
justice
reed
and
able
to
have
given
justice
reed.
now,
the
section
20
(11)
i've
just
about
to
say,
nearly
reached
this
--
the
common
law
rule
of
liability.
but
it
doesn't
add
anything,
any
greater
liability
to
the
rule.
now,
the
tolerance
rules
approved
by
the
commission
are
not
predicated
upon
any
sort
of
carrier
liability.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
fact
to
the
court.
the
commission
found
that
in
its
report.
and
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
under
the
--
it
stated
--
i
missed
maybe
that
was
an
unfortunate
word.
the
commission
stated
that
the
--
in
its
--
in
its
decision
that
the
liability
imposed
here
is
not
predicted
upon
or
rather
that
the
--
that
the
rules
are
not
predicted
upon
in
a
sort
of
common
carrier
liability
but
rather
upon
the
inherent
nature
of
the
goods
that
the
common
carriers
hold.
in
this
case,
eggs
which
are
--
agree
--
as
agreed
in
the
record
are
very
fragile,
very
easily
to
break
and
that
the
--
even
they
--
in
the
packing
and
the
breaking
operations
as
described
in
the
department
of
justice
is
impossible
to
even
carry
those
on
without
causing
some
of
--
some
damage
to
the
egg,
even
in
just
the
packing.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
in
the
record.
the
--
the
evidence
is
in
the
record.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
there
--
there
is
a
finding
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
there's
a
finding
to
that
effect,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
they're
based
on
averages
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
i
think
that's
what
the
--
the
record
shows.
as
i
say
the
counsel
for
the
railroads
that
fall
to
that
question
will
fall
in
here,
still
of
the
argument
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
is
a
--
i'm
sure,
there's
a
finding
to
that
effect.
it's
based
on
evidences
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
believe
you
have,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
if
the
carrier
filed
a
tariff
under
20
(11)
and
the
commission
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
will
be
binding
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
think
it
would.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
no,
your
honor
it
would.
nothing
binding
to
that.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
don't
believe
there
could
be
any
difference
in
the
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
it's
my
understanding
of
the
--
of
the
law.
now,
the
--
suppose
rules
approved
by
the
commission
as
i've
been
saying
a
moment
ago
when
diverted
here.
the
--
that
these
rules
are
not
predicated
upon
carrier
liability.
but
they
are
rather
predicated
upon
the
damage
that
exist
this
--
that
--
that
exist
in
carload
shipments
(inaudible)
at
the
time
they're
offered
to
the
carrier
for
transportation.
and
whether
they
have
the
--
the
right
to
protect
themselves
against
claims
for
such
laws
where
they
are
not
responsible.
i
use
the
commissioner's
contention
that
the
1%
tolerance
were
approved
covering
the
transit
damages
come
within
the
common
law
exceptions
of
inherent
rights.
because
of
the
--
the
evidence
shows
that
the
--
there's
the
approximate
amount
of
1%
or
more
damage
found
in
the
cases
at
--
the
egg
case
at
destination
than
there
was
at
origin.
and
that
this
was
due
to
the
inherent
nature
of
the
egg.
now,
this
finding
was
based
upon
evidence
that
was
presented
by
the
department
of
agriculture
who
--
which
made
studies
to
determine
the
amount
of
breakage
in
the
eggs
and
damage
to
eggs
before
the
eggs
were
delivered
to
the
carrier.
and
that
percentage
was
--
was
recorded.
the
same
inspector
using
the
candling
process
that
destination
as
they
used
at
the
--
at
origin.
and
--
and
re-inspecting
those
same
cases
that
were
marked
at
destination
discovered
that
there
was
additional
amount
of
damage
in
them
for
about
--
to
be
settled
about
one
and
seven-tenths
percent.
now,
that
was
the
testimony
that
was
furnished
by
the
department
of
agriculture
who
furnished
these
studies,
made
the
studies
and
furnished
the
evidence
at
the
request
of
the
commission
for
the
purpose
of
solving
the
very
problem
that
is
here
before
us
today.
now
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
it
--
it
would
not
be,
your
honor,
because
even
in
trucks
--
which
was
the
evidence
shows
there
that
the
amount
of
damage
which
the
commission
says
was
negligible.
that's
predicated
on
the
claims
that
were
filed.
we
don't
know
how
much
breakage
there
was
to
go
with
the
eggs
there.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
oh,
yes.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
that
might
be
different
but
yet
it
involves
the
same
inferences
and
well
i
don't
know
that
there's
a
--
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
through
them
all.
well,
the
reason
why
these
rules,
if
the
court
please,
are
--are
reasonable
and
why
they
should
be
approved
because
they
--
they
devise
a
uniform
method
of
eliminating
from
--
from
shipments
of
eggs,
the
amount
that
were
in
damaged
condition
before
the
carrier
ever
received
them.
and
in
that
way
it
would
avoid
at
what
amounts
foremost
to
involuntary,
if
not
it
does
involve
in
the
amount
to
involuntary
rebates
for
the
carrier
to
have
pay
shipper
for
damages
in
the
--
to
the
property
that
was
in
a
damaged
condition
before
the
shipper
ever
delivered
it
to
the
carrier
is
exactly
what,
what
is
involved
here.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
he
does
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
the
shipper
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
you
tell
me.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
all
as
i
think
in
some
--
in
the
--
many
of
these
regulations
they
may
fall
somewhat
unevenly.
i
don't
know
what
to
do
here
particularly
because
of
the
carrier
--
if
a
shipper
--
that
these
--
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
damages,
if
the
shipment
he
gets
contains
few
or
no
damages.
the
rules
do
not
bother
him
at
all.
he's
not
affected
by
it.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
(inaudible)
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
but
it's
conceivable
that
they
might
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
to
correct
that.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
i
don't
believe
the
commission
intended
to
--
to
side
somebody
based
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
it
does
in
--
in
effect
--
it
does
as
far
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
for
some
people
to
maybe
pay
some
damages.
i
mean
pay
something
that's
probably
was
for
eggs
that
were
in
their
shipment
it
was
not
damaged.
but
i
--
i
don't
know
if
that
is
true
but
that
could
--
could
happen.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
let's
say
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
oh,
hold
on.
i
don't
intend
--
i
don't
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
that
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
if
the
court
please.
we
don't
know
that
he
--
that
what
he
had
that
many
eggs
and
they
placed
--
were
placed
when
they
were
--
when
they
were
packed
because
the
evidence
shows
that
there
is
damage
in
there
in
every
crate
and
of
course
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
no,
not
--
it's
not
--
it's
not
that
yet
matter.
on
the
average
he
would
have.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
and
it
may
be
possible
that
some
shipper
would
have
less
damage
than
others.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right
and
i
--
i
believe
that
the
--
this
court
held
that
the
commission
could
do
that
in
the
assigned
party.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
i
--
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
unless
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
that
--
that
is
correct,
only
if
this
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
we
think
the
--
they
do
not
--
we
think
they
do
have
the
right
to
do
it
under
the
theory
of
the
assigned
car
cases
and
here's
another
--
another
case
i'd
like
to
--
but
on
that
--
that
this
court
held
in
--
i
can't
find
that
the
--
it's
not
here
right
now
but
it's
the
--
the
case
in
which
you've
held
mentioned
the
--
and
so
the
assigned
car
cases
and
also
in
the
new
england's
division
cases.
the
court
held
there,
this
court
held
that
the
commission
may
approve
rules
and
the
regulations
are
enter
orders
that
would
have
general
application
although
they
wouldn't
affect
every
railroad
or
every
rate.
but
yes
they
may
file
such
a
--
may
approve
about
the
rule.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
i
could
not
answer
that
question.
but
i
have
my
own
ideas
about
it.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that
the
truckers,
of
course,
will
--
they
--
they
move
fast.
they'd
come
up
and
they'll
back
up
against
the
--
the
loading,
unloading
dock
or
the
car.
they'll
have
a
load
of
eggs
and
these
consignee
is
anxious
to
get
them.
and
they
get
them
to
start
as
soon
as
possible.
and
he
brings
the
man,
the
trucker
does,
and
say
"here
they
are."
and
--
and
of
course
if
the
consignee
begins
to
complain
about
it,
the
truckers
as
well
you
could
take
them
or
leave
them.
i
--
i
--
don't
know
(inaudible)
there
are
some
--
something
to
that
is
the
effect
--
an
attitude
to
that
effect
on
the
part
that
truckers
i
think
that
maybe
the
consignees
will
--
will
take
the
--
now,
that's
the
--
my
own
right
there.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
not
if
they
have
damage
of
course
in
the
--
if
the
eggs
are
leaky
they
wouldn't
to
that.
but
i'm
talking
about
a
--
a
new
inspection
like
it's
conducted
by
the
consignees
at
places
like
new
york.
and
new
york
is
not
the
only
place
in
the
country
where
there's
lots
of
damage
found
in
eggs.
i'm
not
talking
of
damaged
economy
but
where
the
claims
are
private
also
in
philadelphia
and
in
boston
and
--
and
baltimore
and
pittsburgh
and
new
jersey
on
--
at
the
other
point.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
if
the
court
please.
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
think
it's
immaterial
anyway
because
if
the
--
if
the
ship
doesn't
have
any
--
and
at
this
proportion
he
was
not
affected
unless
he
had
damaged
the
eggs
and
the
crate
by
this
--
by
this
rule.
and
the
carriers
i'd
like
to
plead
that
sought
with
the
court
that
the
carriers
are
not
exempt
from
any
liability
which
they
caused
themselves.
and
the
--
and
the
commission
report
and
its
order
intended
only
to
relieve
the
carriers
from
paying
for
damages
that
were
preexisting
in
the
shipments
before
the
carrier
ever
received
them
and
then
when
such
damage
has
occurred
during
transit
that
was
due
to
the
inherent
nature
of
the
eggs.
and
that
was
all
that
the
commission
intended
to
be
suited
liable
and
intend
to
be
a
suit
on
the
party's
hearing.
in
fact
your
honors
might
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
the
--
the
testimony
shows
with
respect
--
adduced
of
the
hearing
and
agree
much
on
them
is
punished
by
the
department
of
agriculture
when
the
appellant
in
this
case
which
showed
that
there
was
--
and
of
course
other
--
and
railroad
testimony
would
show
that
there
was
more
damage
existing
in
the
egg
crates
as
i
understood,
remember
the
record.
they're
existing
with
respect
to
the
eggs
that
were
packed,
transported
in
the
country,
delivered
to
the
packing
class
in
the
country
and
they
have
swapped
into
the
--
at
the
railway.
then
there
was
to
those
eggs
that
were
packed
at
the
rail
point
of
origin,
if
there's
a
difference
and
that
justifies
the
commission's
findings
in
that.
if
i'm
not
mistaken
--
if
i'm
mistaken
about
that
mr.
zearfaus
in
apology
will
correct.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
of
course
i
have
not
planned
to
discuss
the
evidence
on
--
on
this,
but
then
got
into
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
