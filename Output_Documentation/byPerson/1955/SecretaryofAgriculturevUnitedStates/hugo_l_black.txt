how
can
you
find
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they're
finding.
it
would
emphasized
for
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
findings
with
evident
distortion
from
the
commission
from
full
investigation
of
the
fact.
they
have
found
that
every
shipper
--
shipment
of
eggs
throughout
the
country
separately
and
distinctly
losses
3%
from
inherent
weaknesses
of
the
egg.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
there
was
a
finding
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
there
was
a
finding
already
made
from
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
amount
to
as
to
the
shipper?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
amount
to
as
to
the
shipper?
it
can
tell
to
accept
less
than
the
value
of
the
common
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
that
there
may
be
a
uniform
rule
to
the
advantage
of
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
the
issue
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
person
--
i
don't
believe
you're
quite
meeting
the
issues
as
i'd
see
it.
maybe
i
don't
see
it
correctly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
--
there's
no
question
in
here
that
the
affect
of
the
rule
that
some
people
would
have
eggs
destroyed
who
cannot
get
the
full
value
of
the
egg
that
were
destroyed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
eggs
will
not
be
destroyed
to
that
extent.
so
he
losses
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
some
other
men
who
may
have
--
they
have
just
the
opposite
effect.
but
what
you
are
claiming
here
is
the
i.c.c.
to
make
it
have,
has
the
power
to
do
what
it's
done,
now
which
is
to
lump
it
altogether
to
say
that
we
can
put
--
make
every
--
every
person
who
would
ship
the
eggs
to
have
some
law
whether
he
had
a
law
to
none.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
keep
from
being
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
claim
that
that
there
is
a
universal
rule
that
every
shipper,
throughout
the
country
who
ships
eggs
is
bound
to
have
3%
of
his
eggs
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
some
of
it
would
have
1%,
we'll
say
and
some
of
them
5%.
and
you
have
one
who
can
say
3%.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
about
the
man
who's
only
had
1%
loss,
who
has
to
recover
for
eggs
to
the
extent
--
the
same
as
though
he'd
lost
5%.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
3%
damage
in
every
crate
that
showed
up--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
from
what
you
said
at
the
beginning,
commission
reads
the
conclusion
that
the
trial
by
lawsuit
method
on
proof
of
individual
loss
of
damage
was
resulting
in
bad
injury
to
the
railroad.
that
they
were
having
to
pay
some
time
when
they
shouldn't
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they've
tried
to
work
it
out
by
putting
a
--
relieving
them
from
the
damages
of
loss,
injury
that
might
--
that
in
view
of
the
lawsuit,
to
that
individual
lawsuit
by
applying
a
general
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
do
it.
but
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
in
rate
cases
that
i
think
we
have
some
of
them
that
ordinarily,
this
grade
agent
--
the
grading
agent
is
still
taken
into
account
the
lawsuits
on
the
account
of
injuries
to
persons
or
injuries
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
takes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
that
is
individual.
here
as
i
understand
it,
the
argument
is
in
the
right.
that
you're
entitled
to
get
your
damage
--
damage
suit
for
use
on
the
average
of
what
the
actual
law
did.
now,
are
you
not
allowed
then
in
your
rate
cases
and
do
you
not
take
into
account
when
you
fix
the
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
of
course
you
can't
meet
this
with
the
common
law
and
no
other
law
insofar
as
i
know
has
ever
held
that
any
company,
railroad
or
otherwise
is
liable
to
damages
which
doesn't
exist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
but
if
you
were
fix
rates
now
and
had
a
rate
and
want
to
fix
one
time,
would
you
not
take
into
account
how
much
it's
been
costing
you
to
individually.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
whether
you
--
whether
you
actually
injured
them
or
not.
whether
some
shippers
had
got
more
than
they
could,
others
have
gone
(inaudible)
wouldn't
you
put
in
the
big
and
show
how
much
you've
been
losing
year
by
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
was
always
the
part
of
the
rebate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
the
question
i
gave
because
(inaudible)
it's
pretty
well
understood
by
people
who
ship
things
that
they
pay
the
rate.
it's
fixed.
it's
fixed
now
and
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
but
it's
also
been
pretty
generally
understood
in
accepting
there'
a
rule
throughout
the
country
that
a
man
who
files
a
lawsuit
can
recover
his
full
damage.
and
the
other
fellow
who
has
more
damages
can
recover
more.
somebody
else
who
had
less
can
recover
less.
buying
is
more
intriguing
with
pattern
of
what
i've
seen
either.
for
this
to
handled
as
a
rate
model
instead
of
this
guy
is
need
of
--
as
whatever
that
is.
