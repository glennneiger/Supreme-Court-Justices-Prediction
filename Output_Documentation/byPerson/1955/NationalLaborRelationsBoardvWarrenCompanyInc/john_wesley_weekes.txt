mr.
john
wesley
weekes
may
it
please
the
court.
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
the
most
forceful
and
the
most
persuasive
argument
that
could
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
lower
court
points
out
that
different
considerations
apply
in
an
enforcement
proceeding
and
in
a
contempt
proceeding.
in
an
enforcement
proceeding,
the
board
is
entitled
to
a
decree
despite
prior
performance
that
in
a
contempt
proceeding,
the
court
points
out
that
it
is
the
judge
and
the
judge
alone
of
the
facts
and
the
judge
of
what
will
best
vindicate
its
own
decree
and
serve
the
public
policy.
it
points
out
that
it
is
the
judge
of
the
respondent's
acts
and
attitude.
and
of
conditions
arising
after
the
enforcement
decree
between
that
and
the
petition
for
contempt
that
in
the
case
at
bar,
conditions
had
changed
between
the
enforcement
decree
and
the
petition
to
contempt
that
through
no
fault
of
the
employer,
and
so
the
court
found.
there
had
been
a
depletion
in
the
ranks
of
the
union
adherence
that
five
of
the
six
employees
involved
had
notified
the
employer
that
they
no
longer
wish
to
be
represented
by
a
union
that
this
was
voluntary,
not
instigated
by
their
--
by
the
employer
in
any
way.
then
the
employer
--
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
was
there
a
hearing
before
the
court?
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
no,
sir.
there's
a
hearing
before
the
court
on
the
contempt
issue.
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
yes.
this
circuit
had
a
hearing.
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
no,
on
the
record.
the
record
was
--
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
that's
right,
and
by
affidavits
and
--
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
no,
sir.
the
employer
petitioned
the
board
to
conduct
an
election
to
determine
fairly
the
wishes
of
the
employees.
they
had
requested
time
and
again
of
the
union,
the
opportunity
for
an
election
to
determine
through
secret
ballot
what
the
wishes
of
the
employees
were.
this
request
made
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
an
election
to
determine
by
secret
ballot.
the
majority
status
was
flatly
denied
by
the
board.
now
these
were
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court,
the
judge
of
the
facts
in
a
contempt
proceeding.
and
the
fifth
circuit
said,
"it
would
not
hold
the
respondent
in
contempt
where
it
appear
that
the
board,
by
refusing
to
lend
its
assistance
to
a
decertification
election
is
responsible
for
the
situation
as
now
exist.
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
a
contempt
adjudication
would
result
in
a
violation
of
the
act
and
of
the
public
policy
for
which
it
stands.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
act
of
1947
which
certainly
confirmed
the
belief
that
the
act
and
the
amendments
were
passed
not
for
the
protection
of
the
employer,
not
for
the
protection
of
the
union
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
employee
and
him
alone.
his
right
to
participate
in
union
activities
or
to
refrain
from
such
participation
was
to
be
safeguarded
at
all
times.
and
even
before
the
1947
act,
the
courts
frequently
decreed
enforcement
condition
upon
an
election
to
be
held
by
the
board
to
determine
the
majority
staffs
in
view
of
change
conditions.
as
early
as
in
1938
with
the
second
circuit
in
the
remington
(inaudible)
case
said
that
in
granting
enforcement
--
in
granting
enforcement
that
it
conditions
change
or
had
changed,
the
employer
should
challenge
the
power
of
the
union
and
must
invoke
an
inquiry
of
the
board
if
it
did
not
bargain
with
the
union.
and
the
court
speaking
through
judge
learned
hand
said,
"if
it
does
so,
that
is
invoke
the
inquiry,
we
shall
treat
that
to
refusal
that
is
to
bargain
as
a
contempt
until
after
the
labor
board
has
certified
the
results.
and
other
courts
granted
similar
relief
where
there
was
a
good
--
there
was
good
course
to
believe
that
the
union
no
longer
represented
the
majority.
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
the
company
furnished
wage
information
--
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
and
they
bargain
in
conference.
they
met
in
two
occasions.
they
discussed
a
proposed
contract.
they
did
furnish
wage
information.
now,
we
did
not
bargain
or
attempt
to
bargain
to
a
conclusion
because
of
the
ever
present
thought
that
the
union
did
not
represent
a
majority.
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
the
circuit
court.
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
after
the
board's
order,
it
consisted
of
several
parts.
it
consisted
of
reinstatement
of
employees.
we
did
that.
there
were
four,
i
believe,
four
discharged
employees
all
laid
off
as
the
record
showed
but
the
board
found
that
they
had
been
discriminatorily
laid
off.
they
were
reinstated.
their
back
wages
were
paid.
the
board
notified
the
respondent
to
post
notices
to
cease
and
desist
from
saving
practices.
these
notices
were
posted.
they
--
they
met
with
the
union
again
--
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
but
the
--
for
bargaining
but
expressing
the
doubt
throughout
of
the
majority's
status
of
the
union.
the
company
felt
it
knew
its
employees,
that
there
had
been
a
turnover
and
that
only
two
of
the
original
compliment
were
left.
they
felt
that
they'd
knew
the
--
the
wishes
of
the
employees
that
they
didn't
want
--
it's
not
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
told,
i
can
not
say.
but
anyway,
the
company
was
feeling
the
whole
time
that
this
union
did
not
represent
a
majority.
mr.
john
wesley
weekes
after
the
order
of
the
court,
they
only
met
one
time
and
i
would
not
say
that
that
was
serious
bargaining,
if
your
honor
pleases,
yes.
it
was
confronted
at
all
the
times
with
the
doubt
as
a
majority
status.and
in
the
interval
was
this
petition
presented
to
the
man
written
form
by
the
employees
stating
that
they
didn't
want
any
union
representing
them
for
bargaining
purposes.
now,
under
the
old
proceedings
and
before
the
act
of
1947,
the
board
would
not
yield
in
its
decisions
and
repeatedly
refused
to
grant
elections
in
such
instances
of
changed
conditions.
but
the
congress
took
note
of
the
situation
under
the
practice
and
enlarged
the
right
of
petition
in
representation
cases
in
the
reply
of
the
board
to
hold
election.
speaking
of
the
past
practices
of
the
board,
the
senate
labor
committee
said,
"despite
the
absence
of
discriminatory
language
in
the
act,
the
board
refused
to
entertain
petitions
filed
by
employees
who
wished
to
demonstrate
that
the
current
or
a
certain
bargaining
representative
is
not
the
choice
of
the
majority.
the
committee
bill
would
make
it
necessary
for
the
board
to
entertain
petitions
from
the
employees
irrespective
of
the
kind
of
the
reliefs
sought.
so
to
correct
the
abuses,
congress
abducted
the
provisions
of
section
9
(c)
in
the
1947
act,
enlarging
the
right
of
petition
on
the
part
of
the
employee
and
employer.
and
it
was
a
conference
committee
that
reported
significant
changes
in
operations
may
require
a
redetermination
of
the
bargaining
representation.
similarly,
a
substantial
expansion
or
diminution
of
the
working
force
might
require
special
treatment.
the
conference
committee,
the
senate
labor
committee,
the
house
labor
committee
clearly
expressed
the
mandate
that
an
election
must
be
held
upon
a
petition
except
when
and
only
one
instance
where
an
election
had
been
held
in
the
previous
12
months.
and
no
election
has
ever
been
held
in
this
employer's
plant.
congress
fully
guaranteed
that
no
union
would
be
thrust
on
the
employees
by
adding
in
the
1947
act
to
section
7
that
employees
might
refrain
from
participation.
employee
shall
have
the
right
to
refrain
from
any
and
all
of
such
activities.congress
was
positive
in
its
purpose
to
protect
the
employee
and
give
expression
to
his
will.
now,
the
facts
presented
relied
upon
by
the
board
or
the
--
in
cases
relied
upon
the
--
by
the
board
are
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
facts
in
the
case
at
bar.
in
the
brooks
case
which
mr.
findling
has
mentioned,
there
has
been
an
election
in
which
the
union
won
eight
to
five.
one
week
later,
there
was
a
change
in
heart
on
the
part
of
the
employees.
there
had
been
an
election.
there
was
no
election
in
the
case
at
bar.
in
the
brooks
case,
there
was
no
petition
for
decertification.
in
this
case,
there
was.
in
the
brooks
case,
this
court
pointed
out
the
employees
or
employer
should
submit
the
grievance
to
the
board
and
petition
for
relief.
this
we
did.
and
in
the
great
(inaudible)
case
which
it
cites
that
is
under
an
old
statute
and
did
not
contain
the
provisions
of
section
7
and
9
(c)
(1)
and
therefore
we
contend
it's
inapplicable.
and
we
say
that
it
may
be
assumed
that
this
practice
of
the
old
board
under
the
old
act
was
under
review
by
the
congress
in
the
writing
of
the
1947
act
and
was
the
practice
at
which
it
was
striking.
now,
we
contend
that
our
course
of
conduct
had
been
repeatedly
approved
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
in
other
courts
as
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
the
lower
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
dismissing
the
contempt
petition.
it
said,
"under
these
circumstances,
we
think
that
the
court,
instead
of
vindicating
would
(inaudible)
itself
and
its
own
decree
and
do
violence
to
the
act
if
it
ordered
the
employer
to
force
upon
its
employees
as
bargaining
agent,
a
union,
not
(inaudible)
merely
because
some
six
years
before,
the
board
had
ordered
the
employer
to
recognize
it
as
bargaining
agent
for
its
then
employees.
