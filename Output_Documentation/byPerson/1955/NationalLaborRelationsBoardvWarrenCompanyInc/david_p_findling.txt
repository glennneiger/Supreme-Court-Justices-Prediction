mr.
david
p.
findling
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
brought
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
firth
circuit,
which
dismissed
the
board's
petition
to
adjudge
the
warren
company
in
contempt
of
an
enforcement
decree.
the
enforcement
decree
had
been
entered
in
the
conventional
enforcement
proceedings
in
the
court
below
under
section
10
(e)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
among
other
things
required
the
company
to
bargain
collectively
with
lodge
46
of
the
machinists
union.
the
court
below
had
recognized
in
the
enforcement
proceedings
that
under
the
applicable
substantive
law
and
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
was
obliged
to
enter
the
enforcement
decree
requiring
bargaining
with
the
union,
despite
the
union's
inability
to
maintain
its
majority
membership
among
the
employees
after
the
refusal
to
bargain
and
other
unfair
labor
practices.
but
the
court
held
in
the
contempt
proceeding
that
the
different
consideration,
and
that's
a
quotation
from
the
court's
opinion,
the
different
considerations
applicable
to
contempt
as
distinguished
from
enforcement
proceedings
committed
it
in
its
discretion
to
accept
as
a
defense
in
the
civil
contempt
proceedings,
the
lost
of
majority
which
it
had
recognized
was
not
a
defense
to
the
entry
of
the
enforcement
decree.
we
think
that
in
taking
this
position,
the
court
exceeded
the
permissible
limits
of
its
legal
discretion
and
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
court
was
found
to
give
effect
to
the
enforcement
decree
by
compelling
obedience
to
it
through
the
imposition
of
civil
contempt
sanction.
the
facts
as
they
are
set
forth
in
the
board's
petition
to
adjudge
the
company
in
contempt
was
substantially
admitted
in
the
company's
answer,
and
may
i
think
the
--
fairly
summarized
as
follows.
after
the
usual
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
under
section
10
of
the
act,
the
board
found
on
june
30,
1949,
that
the
company
had
violated
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act
by
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union.
professing
a
doubt
as
to
the
union's
majority
status
when
in
fact
it
had
no
such
doubt
and
at
the
same
time,
making
an
election
to
determine
the
employees
true
wishes
impossible
by
dismissing
four
--
by
discharging
four
of
the
eight
employees
in
the
unit
because
they
had
joined
the
union
and
by
engaging
another
acts
of
intimidation
and
coercion
with
respect
to
the
employees
unionization.
after
the
board's
decision
order
issue,
the
company
took
steps
to
comply
with
the
reinstatement
requirements
as
the
payment
of
back
pay
to
the
employees
discharge.
it
also
post
the
notices
required
by
the
board's
order.
but
it
did
not
comply
with
the
bargaining
requirements
of
the
order.
in
that
respect,
as
the
undisputed
fact
show
the
company
despite
repeated
request
by
the
union
for
bargaining
conferences
met
with
the
union
only
once
during
this
period.
that
was
on
september
8,
1950
when
the
union
submitted
a
contract
proposal
and
the
company
took
no
position
on
it
except
to
say
that
it
would
consider
the
proposed
contract
and
let
the
union
know
whether
the
contract
was
acceptable
and
if
the
contract
was
not
acceptable,
it
would
submit
counter
proposals
with
respect
to
the
provisions
that
were
unacceptable.
this
promise,
the
company
never
kept
thereafter
despite
the
union's
repeated
request
for
a
statement
of
its
position
on
the
contract
or
prepare
the
meetings.
instead,
on
august
6,
1951,
the
company
wrote
the
union
that
only
two
of
the
eight
employees
comprising
the
union
--
the
unit
continued
to
be
employed
in
the
plant,
but
the
company
therefore
doubted
the
continued
majority
status
of
the
union
and
that
it
would
be
glad
to
meet
on
august
16
and
here
i
quote
from
the
letter
which
is
at
41
of
the
record,
“to
discuss
this
feature
and
what
proof
you
have
of
the
majority
status.”
at
about
the
same
time
on
august
14,
the
board
instituted
the
enforcement
proceedings
in
the
court
below
to
which
the
company
responded
that
although
there
were
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
upon
which
to
face
the
board's
findings
and
order,
the
order
should
nevertheless
not
be
enforced
because
--
and
here
again
i
quote,
and
this
is
at
pages
1
and
2
of
the
record,
“the
order
has
been
obeyed
in
all
of
its
provisions
and
because
of
changed
condition,
not
attributable
to
respondent's
conduct
and
the
references
obviously
is
to
the
turn
over
among
the
employees
in
the
unit
normal
cost
of
business.”
the
union
does
not
now
represent
a
majority
in
this
small
unit
and
respondent
should
not
be
required
to
bargain
fairly
with
it.
the
court
below
rejected
that
defense
in
the
enforcement
case
principally
on
the
authority
of
this
court's
decision
in
national
labor
relations
board
against
mexia
textile
mills
in
339
u.s.
the
court
pointed
out
that
in
that
case,
this
court
had
expressly
ruled
that
compliance
with
the
order
did
not
affect
the
board's
right
to
an
enforcement
decree
in
as
much
as
the
act
contemplated
that
there
be
immediately
available
to
the
board,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
court's
opinion,
“an
existing
court
decree
to
serve
as
a
basis
for
contempt
proceedings
in
the
event
a
renewal
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
occurs
after
the
enforcement
order.”
in
its
opinion
on
enforcement,
the
court
below
also
pointed
out
that
the
same
case
settled
the
doctrine
that
the
union's
allege
lost
and
i'm
reading
again,
“may
not
be
urged
as
a
defense
in
an
enforcement
proceeding.”
and
so
on
august
7,
1952,
the
court
below
entered
its
decree
enforcing
the
board's
order
including
as
i've
said,
the
bargaining
provision.
the
union
thereupon
immediately
renewed
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
on
certain
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
august
7,
1952,
your
honor.
the
decree
is
at
pages
3
to
7
of
the
record.
mr.
david
p.
findling
that's
the
date
of
the
opinion,
your
honor.
the
decree
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
date
of
the
judgment,
the
decree
was
entered
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
in
the
fifth
circuit,
your
honor,
they're
separate
document.
the
union,
thereupon,
immediately
as
i've
said
renewed
its
request
for
bargaining.
but
the
company
persisted
in
its
refusal.
and
on
august
26,
1952,
which
was
only
19
days
after
the
decree
had
been
entered
and
of
the
time
when
of
course
there'd
been
no
further
meetings
or
bargaining
between
the
parties.
the
company
wrote
a
letter
to
the
board
with
a
copy
to
the
union
in
which
it
again
took
the
position
that
it
had
already
complied
with
the
board's
order
that
the
union
no
longer
represented
a
majority
of
the
employees
since
only
two
of
the
original
complement
in
the
union
continued
to
be
employed
in
the
plant
and
the
company
further
took
the
position
that
while
the
lost
of
majority
was
not
a
defense
in
the
enforcement
case,
it
was
a
defense
in
further
proceedings.
and
again,
the
further
proceeding
is
a
quotation
from
the
company's
letter.
mr.
david
p.
findling
there
are
two
intervening
circumstances
that
the
company
realized
then
but
they
had
not
yet
occurred.
they
occurred
later
in
november
and
january
of
1953,
your
honor.
and
if
i
may,
i
refer
to
those
as
i
reach
that
point.
thereafter,
until
january
1953,
the
company
engaged
in
rather
extended
correspondence
with
both
the
board's
officers
and
the
union
in
which
it
profess
the
willingness
to
meet,
but
at
the
same
time,
continued
to
withhold
forth
right
recognition
from
the
union
by
repeatedly
questioning
the
unions
majority
status
among
the
men
abandoning
the
plant
by
asking
new
proof
of
the
union's
majority
and
by
ignoring
the
union's
request
for
wage
information
in
another
data
which
the
union
had
requested
--
which
the
union
was
asking
for
because
it
insisted
that
such
information
was
necessary
in
order
for
it
to
bargain
intelligently.
and
finally,
when
on
january
19,
1953,
a
meeting
was
finally
arranged
with
the
company
and
this
was
the
only
meeting
after
the
court
decree
and
only
the
second
meeting
between
the
parties
in
the
entire
history
of
their
relationships
since
the
board's
order
was
entered
in
june
1950.
the
company
flatly
took
the
position
that
it
hesitated
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
matter
of
a
contract
because
of
its
doubts
as
to
majority
and
that
asked
the
union
to
consent
to
a
board
election
to
redetermine
its
status
as
the
employees
agent.
the
union
refused
to
do
so
in
substance
taking
the
position
that
under
the
board's
order
and
the
course
decree,
the
company
continued
to
be
obliged
to
bargain
with
it.
and
the
board,
on
march
4,
1953,
sustained
the
union
in
this
position
in
effect
and
dismissed
a
petition
for
a
new
election
and
this
is
one
of
the
circumstances
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
petition
for
a
new
election.
dismissed
a
petition
for
a
new
election
which
the
company
had
filed
on
january
27,
1953
and
which
it
had
supported
by
a
letter
dated
november
3,
1952
and
that's
the
second
new
circumstances,
the
receipt
of
this
letter
from
november
3,
1952
which
was
signed
by
five
of
the
six
employees
then
in
the
unit
and
which
said
in
effect
that
the
employees
did
not
want
the
union
to
represent
them
and
asked
that
the
union
be
--
be
certified
as
their
representative.
so,
i
say
that
was
attached
to
the
company's
petition
to
the
board
for
a
new
election
which
petition
of
the
board
rejected.
now,
despite
this
rejection
of
the
company's
petition,
the
company
refused
to
answer
still
another
request
by
the
union
for
bargaining.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
p.
findling
the
--
the
refusal
was
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
the
company
which
appears
at
page
70
--
70
of
the
record.
this
is
down
near
the
bottom
of
that
page.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
page
70,
yes,
your
honor.
that
letter
that
starts
--
so
the
board
had
considered
your
request
for
review
of
the
original
direct
and
refusal
issue
notice
appearing
in
that
case
has
sustained
his
dismissal
of
the
petition
in
substance
because
you
continued
to
be
obliged
to
bargain
with
--
with
the
union
pursuant
to
the
board
order
and
the
enforcement
decree.
mr.
david
p.
findling
it
--
it
means,
your
honor
that
because
the
company
had
not
yet
complied
with
the
bargaining
requirements
of
the
order,
thereby,
reestablishing
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
employees
were
truly
free
to
express
their
wishes
as
to
organization.
the
board
would
not
hold
a
new
election.
in
other
words,
the
board's
order
and
the
enforcement
decree
continued
to
have
vitality
for
purposes
of
compelling
bargaining
between
the
company
and
the
union
until
there'd
been
a
reasonable
bargaining
between
the
parties
either
to
an
impasse
or
a
contract.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
essentially
the
same
theory
as
what's
announced
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
franks
brothers
case
that
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
it
last
for
a
reasonable
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
no,
your
honor,
it
last
for
a
reasonable
time
and
there
are
decisions
of
the
board
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
northwestern
photo
engraving
for
example
in
which
within
six
months
approximately,
after
the
entry
of
a
court
decree
requiring
bargaining,
the
board
processed
a
petition
for
a
new
election
to
determine
the
employees'
wishes.
mr.
david
p.
findling
it
did
it
in
that
case
because
it
appeared
that
the
company
and
the
union
had
met,
they
had
bargained
in
good
faith,
and
although
no
contract
resulted
because
they
could
not
agree
on
the
substantive
terms
of
an
agreement,
the
vitality
of
the
decree
had
exhausted
itself
for
purposes
of
that
situation
because
by
virtue
of
the
bargaining,
the
prior
refusal
of
bargain
had
been
remedied.
and
the
situation
was
re-established
in
the
plant
when
the
employees
were
free
to
vote
in
an
election
without
the
influence
of
the
company's
prior
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
once
--
once
the
employer
has
refused
to
bargain,
obviously
there's
been
an
impact
on
the
employees'
organizational
efforts.
in
the
first
place,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
franks
and
in
mexia,
the
employees
are
discouraged
in
their
organizational
efforts
when
the
employer
refuses
to
deal
with
their
representative.
moreover,
the
employees
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes
they
may,
your
honor.
but
it's
entirely
conjectural
what
the
reasons
are.
what
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
as
--
as
long
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well
your
honor,
the
point
is
that
it
may
reasonably
be
--
have
a
--
it's
certainly
reasonable
from
the
board's
experience
to
assume
that
when
a
union
is
rejected
by
the
employer
although
the
employees
have
already
freely
selected
at
that
time.
one,
the
employees'
adherence
to
the
union
is
discouraged,
second,
the
union's
ability
to
maintain
itself
from
the
plant
either
by
the
adherence,
the
continued
adherence
of
the
old
people
or
by
the
increments
in
membership
from
among
new
people
is
affected.
and
unless
the
board
--
and
so
it's
a
matter
of
conjecture
what
the
employees
might
have
done,
but
for
the
unfair
practice
and
the
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
the
board
had
rejected
that
claim
in
the
unfair
practice
proceeding
and
the
court
had
approved
it
in
the
enforcement
procedure.
mr.
david
p.
findling
the
last
three
selection
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
your
honor
is
the
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
you
must
read
that
letter
in
light
of
the
board
decisions
on
the
same
point
including
cases
like
northwestern
photo
engraving
to
which
i
refer.
mr.
david
p.
findling
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
for
the
board
to
establish
that
that
was
the
very
reason.
i
think
it's
enough
that
it
could
say
that
it
may
be
the
reason.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
but
in
view
of
the
applicable
board
presence
on
the
point
and
so
on,
i
would
say
that
this
letter
had
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
board's
decisions
on
the
--
on
the
particular
subject.
and
so
far
as
the
three-year
delay
is
concerned,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
it
seems
to
me
that
every
one
of
the
cases
involving
bargaining
which
has
reached
this
court
has
involved
longer
delays
than
three
years.
it's
just
inherent
in
the
situation.
and
if
mere
delay
is
to
be
the
controlling
fact
that
the
act
becomes
a
--
a
merry-go-round
and
the
employer
is
permitted
by
his
own
unfair
refusal
of
bargain
to
create
a
situation
in
which
he
escapes
the
statutory
obligation
to
bargain.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well
i
don't
know.
of
course
they
could
--
we
could
reach
a
point
where
the
letter
was
--
was
susceptible
to
an
erroneous
construction.
i
don't
believe
the
company
had
any
doubt
as
to
what
the
implications
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
the
board
does
have
power
to
grant
the
election
if
it
believes
that
in
these
circumstances
of
the
case
of
free
expression
of
employees
which
it
is
possible.
but
it's
been
the
board's
position
consistently
sustained
by
this
court
that
until
there
has
been
some
recognition
in
bargaining
with
the
union
in
compliance
with
the
statute,
the
circumstances
don't
permit
the
pre-election
ordinarily.
mr.
david
p.
findling
your
honor,
i
believe
we
could
require
the
company
to
bargain
with
the
--
i'm
assuming
when,
your
honor
said
the
union,
it's
the
same
union
but
different
compliment
of
employees.
the
board
could
require
the
employer
to
bargain
with
the
union
which
had
been
selected
by
the
employees
at
the
last
time
the
employees
were
free
to
express
a
choice
as
the
unionization
free
to
express
a
choice
of
the
employer
improper
influence.
now
here,
that
situation
was
never
created
because
the
company
never
met
the
bargain
with
that
union.
mr.
david
p.
findling
now
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would.
mr.
david
p.
findling
oh
yes,
your
honor.
the
board's
new
jurisdictional
standards
to
which
i
think,
your
honor
is
referring
don't
turn
on
the
number
of
employees
in
the
plant.
it
turns
on
the
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
flow
of
commerce,
flow
of
goods
and
so
on
into
an
outer
(inaudible)
of
the
state.
mr.
david
p.
findling
not
--
not
vested
in
number
of
employees,
your
honor.
now,
the
court
below
rejected
the
--
dismiss
the
board's
petition
to
judge
the
company
in
contempt
on
june
30,
1954.
the
court
held
that
the
union
did
lost
its
majority
status
even
before
the
enforcement
decree
and
that
while
such
a
loss
was
not
a
defense
in
the
enforcement
case
as
i've
said,
it
was
a
defense
in
the
contempt
proceedings
because
and
i'd
like
to
quote
here
again
from
the
court's
opinion,
“in
such
a
proceeding,
the
court
determines
for
itself
what
order
will
best
serve
the
public
interest
and
at
the
same
time
vindicate
its
own
decree
and
it
will
not
in
disregard
of
the
plain
language
of
the
act.”
and
this
is
at
record
82
that
employees
are
entitled
to
choose
their
own
bargaining
representative
and
may
not
have
one
not
of
their
own
choosing
force
upon
them
issue
a
contempt
order
which
has
the
effect
of
doing
so.
and
your
honors,
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
questions
to
me
and
my
answers
to
him
have
indicated
our
disagreement
with
the
court's
view
that
to
require
the
company
to
bargain
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
would
be
repugnant
to
the
act
because
it
would
be
to
impose
a
representative
on
the
employees
not
chosen
by
the
mandate
of
the
plant.
and
so
i
want
to
address
myself
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
to
the
second
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
took.
that
is
that
in
the
--
in
the
contempt
case,
it
had
a
--
an
unlimited
discretion
to
determine
for
itself
whether
or
not
the
loss
of
majority
should
be
accepted
as
a
defense.
of
course,
we
think
the
court
was
wrong
in
that
and
the
principle
case
on
the
point
is
of
course
the
union
tool
against
wilson
in
259
u.s.
in
that
case,
this
court
pointed
out
that
even
in
civil
contempt
proceedings;
the
power
of
a
court
is
not
the
discretion
of
the
court,
is
not
so
unlimited
that
it
can
refuse
to
apply
well
settled
principles
of
law
to
--
a
conceded
state
of
facts.
and
this
--
this
court
later
pointed
out
in
the
penfield
cases
--
in
the
penfield
case
and
jacksonville
paper
as
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
grant
or
withholding
of
remedial
relief
in
civil
contempt
is
not
wholly
discretionary
with
the
judge
but
must
be
measured
by
the
private
or
public
rights
that
the
law
under
decree
seek
to
protect.
now
here,
the
statute
from
which
the
court
of
appeals
derived
its
enforcement
powers
in
the
first
place
was
designed
to
prevent
in
remedy
unfair
labor
practices.
and
the
machinery
which
congress
has
set
up
to
achieve
that
purpose
contemplated
coordinated
action
of
dual
responsibility
on
the
part
of
the
court
as
well
as
the
board.
the
court's
responsibility
under
the
statute
was
to
apply
its
injunctive
and
contempt
powers,
the
only
sanctions
that
the
statute
imposes
to
compel
obedience
to
proper
board
orders
which
have
been
enforced.
but
the
--
the
court's
discretion
therefore
we
say
was
governed
by
those
standards
and
by
this
legislative
purpose
and
policy
and
by
this
responsibility
which
congress
had
imposed
other
the
act.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
would
leave
out
the
word
up
to
it,
your
honor.
although,
we
did
contempt
there
was
a
criminal
violation
but
that's
not
here.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
believe
myself
that
it
was,
your
honor.
but
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
here
is
whether
civil
contempt
sanctions
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
had
to
be
applied.
mr.
david
p.
findling
we
--
we
joined
allegations
in
criminal
contempt.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
said
--
we
brought
criminal
proceedings
as
well.
we
asked
the
court
to
initiate
them,
the
court
refused
and
we
didn't
bring
that
aspect
of
the
case
here.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well
we
--
in
our
petition,
we
alleged
a
willful
disobedience
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well
your
honor,
if
it's
willful,
we've
got
an
a
fortiori
case
as
to
civil,
i
would
say.
mr.
david
p.
findling
as
i
say
in
my
own
view,
the
view
of
the
board
was
that
this
was
a
willful
disregard.
that's
why
we
brought
criminal
contempt
proceedings
as
well
as
civil.
the
court
saw
fit
to
dismiss
the
criminal
as
well
as
the
civil
of
course.
we
didn't
take
the
criminal
case
here
because
for
one
thing
that
different
questions
approved
involved
different
burden.
and
we're
interested
primarily
in
enforcement
of
the
statute,
not
in
the
--
not
in
the
imposition
of
applying
some
penalties
for
prior
misconduct.
it's
one
way
of
getting
obedience,
of
course.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
can
--
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
said
there,
your
honor
that
we
tried
it.
mr.
david
p.
findling
my
--
my
guess
is
although
i
haven't
exhausted
the
cases
on
that
we
would
have
had
--
we
had
such
a
right.
the
international
longshoremen's
cases
here
involving
criminal
on
our
petition
which
the
court
has
enacted
on
involving
criminal
--
criminal
contempt
case.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
except
that
i
don't
believe
we
have
to
prove
that
it's
willful.
it's
enough
that
there
was
a
decree.
it
was
not
obeyed
for
company's
motives
state
of
mind
when
it
failed
to
comply
is
irrelevant.
we're
entitled
in
civil
contempt
to
have
the
decree
obeyed
by
the
imposition
of
civil
contempt
sanction.
and
whether
it's
also
criminal,
i
think
it's
not
relevant.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
--
i
believe
that
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances,
perhaps
the
kind
of
circumstances
to
which
your
honor
himself
referred
in
the
brooks
case
as
exceptions
to
the
normal
rule
prior
to
the
amendments
to
the
act
that
the
board
would
not
hold
a
new
election.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
certainly
a
--
the
mere
change
in
personnel
in
a
plant
in
the
normal
course
of
business
would
not
warrant
holding
a
new
election,
because
as
i've
said,
the
experience
shows
that
the
refusal
to
bargain
has
had
an
impact
on
the
employees.
and
if
the
union
had
been
accepted
in
the
plant
in
the
first
place,
it's
fair
to
assume
that
it
would
have
had
a
chance
to
get
adherence
from
the
new
man
and
so
on.
it's
a
conjectural
situation.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
would
say
the
time
would
never
be
effective.
but
certainly
not
the
time
involved
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
with
the
19
days
of
the
decree,
the
company
was
asking
the
union
to
reestablish
its
position
among
demand
in
the
plant.
