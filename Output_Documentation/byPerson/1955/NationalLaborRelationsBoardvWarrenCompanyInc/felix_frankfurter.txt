isn't
it?
justice
felix

how
do
you
accept
that
letter?
what
--
apart
from
what
it
said
and
imply
that
the
view
of
the
enforcement
order
outstanding,
it
couldn't
order
(inaudible)
an
election.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what's
the
theory
on
which
the
--
here
the
case
was
decided
by
this
--
what's
the
theory
of
(inaudible)
the
affidavit
filed
by
employee
(inaudible)
particularly
whereby
it
should
deviate
union.is
it
that
they
--
unfair
labor
practice
greater
--
brought
about
that
condition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
there's
got
to
be
a
visitation
of
the
--
of
the
elicit
conduct
of
the
employer,
is
that
right?
justice
felix

does
that
--
is
that
a
matter
of
law
that
influence
last
after
how
long?
justice

(inaudible)

why

case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
sitting
down
and
bargaining
with
the
union,
it
is
plainly
wrong
to
represent
the
employee
three
years
after
the
original
unfair
labor
practice.
was
that
--
what
bearing
on
that
on
the
issue
whether
the
influence
has
(inaudible)
or
not?
is
that
--
is
that
a
psychological
statute
and
must
continue
in
three
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
bearing
does
it
have
if
they
do
agree?
does
that
prove
that
the
influence
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
may
be
--
they
may
have
--
they
may
be
disaffected
from
the
union
for
reasons
of
their
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
see
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
psychologically
no
matter
it's
relevantly
proved
that
the
fact
that
they
don't
bargain
and
the
fact
that
they
do
bargain,
establishes
whether
or
not
the
employees
are
disaffected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
--
is
this
case
a
claimant
from
the
outset
that
the
employers
were
disaffected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
--
then
the
question
is
--
and
we
have
held
that
no
matter
what
(inaudible)
the
selection
applied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
in
it
of
itself
prove
they're
claiming
the
request
for
an
election.
and
they
think
because
presumably,
the
--
the
influence
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
is
still
operative,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
must
read
that
from
this
letter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
three
years
(inaudible)
and
is
it
a
psychological
fact
or
is
it
a
reasonable
fact
in
the
injunctive
relation
that
--
when
from
the
beginning
there
was
a
claim
(inaudible)
the
employers
(inaudible)
that
that's
the
explanation
for
their
disaffect
of
the
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
didn't
even
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
nothing.
you
just
said
that
we
rejected
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
why
the
order
is
enforced.
when
it
comes
to
contempt,
we've
got
a
different
problem.
and
then
the
employer
said,
i've
carried
out
everyone
in
correction
except
the
bargaining.
and
this
is
a
futile
(inaudible)
because
i
know
the
independent
feeling
of
the
manager
that
this
is
not
their
union,
some
other
(inaudible)
and
so,
you
have
an
election
and
i
can
well
understand
the
board
said
it
is
our
judgment
on
the
basis
of
our
experience
that
this
kind
of
influence
last
this
long.
and
therefore,
we
reject
it.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you
can
kind
of
form
a
letter.suppose
they
said
we
think
we
have
no
power
to
get
an
election
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
(inaudible)
in
a
case
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
(voice

fact
of
this
thing.
this
is
an
awfully
futile
performance
because
the
company
could
sit
down,
bargain
with
the
employee
an
(inaudible)
they
were
done
in
good
faith
sided
bargaining
with
the
employees
(inaudible)
in
anything
what
they
see
in
the
union
and
not
to
allow
the
election.
you
then
have
to
have
an
election,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
this
kind
of
situation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
will
come
before
the
court
involving
six
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
plain
remedy
is
to
the
(inaudible)
disobedience
of
the
board
from
the
court's
order,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
clear
about
that
but
was
it
accurate
and
if
it,
what
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
want
to
know
why
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
the
real
proceeding
--
the
real
proceeding
claim
to
be
by
similar
proceeding
against
the
individual
order.
that's
why
the
corporation
assistance
done
by
competing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
this
is
about
the
(inaudible)
enforcement
and
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
have
to
initiate
not
the
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
refusal
--
if
you're
right
of
the
distant
refusal
to
sit
down
and
do
what
you're
told
to
can't
be
--
on
which
it
presents
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you
whether
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it's
the
most
effective
way
of
getting
to
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
have
a
right
to
appeal
from
--
to
dismiss
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
can't
be
--
can't
be
not
willful
because
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
the
policy
of
the
court,
no
matter
what
showing
is
made
and
in
fact
it
turned
over
in
the
--
in
the
labor
board
or
an
internal
(inaudible)
within
the
union,
i
don't
know
any
union
with
rivalry
or
what.
is
it
the
rule
of
the
board
never
to
grant
or
a
petition
for
an
election
when
there
is
disobedience
(inaudible)
on
the
claim
that
the
union
is
really
(inaudible),
is
that
the
policy
of
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
problem.
