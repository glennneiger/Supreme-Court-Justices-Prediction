mr.
jacob
kossman
now,
the
service
contends
that
because
the
word
“witnesses”,
another
statutory
provision
such
as
federal
trade
commission,
the
whole
list
that
the
government
decided
on
page
41,
an
incomplete
list
has
been
held
to
mean
witnesses
there
that
by
analogy,
the
word
“witnesses”
in
the
immigration
nationality
act
also
means
parties
involved.
but
the
subpoena
provision
in
235
(a)
is
not
the
slightest
in
analogous
for
those
subpoena
provisions
in
the
other
agency
that
has
been
outlined
at
page
41,
and
not
only
is
a
different
by
looking
at
it,
but
the
context,
the
legislative
history
and
the
spirit
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
supports
our
view
that
the
immigration
service
is
trying
to
smuggle
something
in
here
that
has
no
business.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
one
difference
is
this,
they
have
authority.
they
have
jurisdiction.
the
subpoena
in
the
scc,
commanding
to
do
something,
to
find
out
something,
bring
in
books
and
what
not,
the
scc
can
issue
an
order.
here
--
here,
the
immigration
naturalization
service,
the
immigration
inspector,
he
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
naturalized
citizen.
we're
dealing
with
the
citizen
here,
not
an
alien.
the
law
has
been
clear
over
the
--
even
before
the
(inaudible)
case
and
it
was
perfectly
explained
there
that
the
judiciary
has
no
voice
when
it
comes
to
the
alien.
but
here,
we're
dealing
with
the
naturalized
citizen.
he
has
gone
through
this
examination
and
reexamination
in
--
by
immigration
inspectors
and
he's
won
his
judgment
in
court.
so,
to
answer
the
question
right
off
the
back,
they
have
no
jurisdiction,
whereas
the
federal
trade
commission
in
the
morton
salt
act
they
can
hand
down
a
new
order.
they
say,
“you
have
to
do
something
about
it.”
and
the
court
generally
refers
to
--
when
the
decree
comes
up
back
again
to
the
agency
to
see
whether
they
are
complying
with
it.
is
the
court
want
to
send
back
an
order
to
the
immigration
naturalization
service,
the
immigration
inspector
to
see
whether
they're
complying,
whether
the
citizen
has
complied
with
what
he
has
complied,
otherwise
he
wouldn't
have
obtained
his
citizenship?
well
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
in
the
congressional
investigation,
of
course,
personal
subpoena,
the
--
there
is
a
certain
purpose
that
the
--
the
congressional
committee
is
supposed
to
ask
questions
about
it,
in
line
of
that
particular
purpose.
and
of
course,
if
they
don't
ask
anything
that's
relevant,
the
question
would
come
up
at
that
stage
of
the
game.
but
here,
from
the
very
nature
of
it,
there's
a
difference
between
this
case
and
the
oklahoma
case
and
all
of
those
cases
because
this
is
not
a
question
that
the
investigation
is
made
in
order
to
discover
whether
coverage
will
exist.
here
from,
the
outset,
coverage
never
exists.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
where
do
they
get
that
power?
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
i
--
i
--
that's
correct.
we
--
i
go
--
i
will
contend
two
things.
first,
statutory
authority
wasn't
granted.
and
secondly,
congress
wouldn't
have
the
power
to
grant
that.
but
of
course,
with
the
policy
of
this
court,
you
consider
constitutional
questions
last,
not
first.
now,
by
just
looking
at
the
subpoena
provision
here,
we
see
it
doesn't
compare,
doesn't
compare
to
any
of
the
subpoena
provisions
in
the
regular
--
regulatory
or
federal
trade
commission
and
scc.
for
instance,
a
typical
example
of
the
subpoena
provision
of
the
federal
trade
commission
would
state,
relating
to
any
matter
under
investigation,
or
the
security
exchange
commission,
that
reads,
“the
commission
made
in
this
--
in
this
discretion,
make
such
investigations
as
a
deemed
necessary.”
then,
skipping
down,
“any
member
of
the
commission
is
empowered
to
administer
oust
subpoena
witnesses,
compel
their
attendance.”
but
what
do
we
have
here?
section
235
(a)
of
the
immigration
act
isn't
in
this
broad
general
form.
it
reads
as
follows,
“the
first
part
of
the
subject,
sentence
of
section
235
(a)
contains
specifications,
and
therefore,
limitation.”
here
is
the
way
it
goes,
“the
attorney
general
and
then
the
immigration
officer
shall
have
the
power
to
require
by
a
subpoena
the
attendance
and
testimony
of
witnesses
before
immigration
officers
and
special
inquiry
officers
relating
to
the
privilege
of
any
person
to
enter,
reenter,
reside
in,
or
pass
through
the
united
states.”
and
then,
and
only
then,
follows
this
phrase,
“or
concerning
any
matter
which
is
material
and
relevant
for
the
enforcement
of
this
act
in
administration
of
the
service.”
now,
if
this
sentence
was
that
the
government
argues,
the
general
subpoena
power
analogous
to
the
subpoena
power
that
we
find
in
the
scc,
federal
trade
commission
or
through
every
agency
subpoena
provision,
especially
the
ones
mentioned
on
page
41,
all
the
government
had
to
do
is
to
read
and
they
would
see
it's
entirely
different
than
this
subpoena
provision.
they
--
they
don't
have
the
specification.
now,
here's
what
the
government
does
on
page
11
of
its
brief.
they
say,
the
plain
language
supports
its
theory
and
quotes,
“the
subpoena
provision.”
that
is
there
version
of
it.
“the
attorney
general
and
then
the
--
and
the
immigration
officer,”
skip,
skip,
skip,
“shall
have
power
to
require
by
subpoena
the
attendance
and
testimony
of
witnesses
before
immigration
officers,”
skip,
skip,
skip,
skip,
skip,
skip,
--
shown
by
the
asterisk,
“concerning
any
matter
which
is
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
and
administration
of
the
service.”
now,
if
that
is
the
way
congress
had
written
that
subpoena
provision,
then
i
couldn't
argue
that
this
subpoena
provision
wasn't
a
general
provision,
and
then
i
have
to
argue
the
constitutional
phase
of
it.
but
here,
the
government
is
simply
not
playing
all
the
notes
as
they
were
written,
and
only
by
skipping
and
leaving
gap,
half
of
the
sentence
they
arrived
at
the
subpoena
provision
which
in
form
is
analogous
to
the
subpoena
provisions
found
in
the
other
administrative
agencies.
mr.
jacob
kossman
what
would
the
other
provision
cover?
the
--
the
best
answer
to
that
is
what
the
service
themselves
have
stated
when
they
asked
for
that
provision
before
congress,
and
that's
almost
a
rather
cynical
position
for
the
immigration
officer
for
the
immigration
service
to
try
to
say
that
this
business
of
matter
includes
denaturalization.
here
is
what
took
place.
in
the
various
documents
prepared
by
the
service
for
the
congress
before
the
passage
of
the
act,
that
here
is
what
they
specifically
stated.
it's
on
page
18
of
the
government's
brief.
in
the
document
entitled,
"original
of
analysis",
and
i'm
reading
from
the
government's
brief
on
page
18,
listen.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would've
known
that
if
the
government
had
imprinted
it,
they
read
--
they'd
put
it
this
way.
“the
second
objective
which
the
service
would
like
to
see
accomplished
in
connection
with
this
subsection,
235
(a),
is
to
provide
specific
authority
to
administer
rousing
the
question
not
only
aliens
who
seek
to
enter.”
the
emphasis
is
on
the
word
“enter”
there,
the
united
states,
“but
also,
nationals
of
the
united
states
and
the
compelled
testimony
by
subpoena
in
such
cases.”
in
this
case,
the
respondent
minker
has
been
a
resident
of
pennsylvania
for
the
past
40
years.
it
is
believed,
that
it
is
the
intent
of
this
section
to
accomplish
that
purpose,
but
the
service
believes
that
certain
amendments
of
language
are
necessary
in
order
that
they
may
be
no
doubt
concerning
the
authority
of
service
officers
in
these
respects.
we
also
wish
to
see
the
power
to
administer
oaths,
and
to
take
and
consider
evidence
extended
to
any
matter,
which
is
material
and
relevant
to
the
administration
of
this
act
in
the
service.
we
have
in
mind
in
that
regard,
the
fact
that
under
administrator
regulation
contained
in
8
c.f.r.
part
95,
there
are
provisions
for
disciplinary
action
against
the
attorney.
another
person
is
authorized
for
practice
before
the
service
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
there
is
doubt
whether
under
existing
law,
any
officer
of
the
service
has
the
authority
to
administer
oaths
and
take
evidence
or
compel
testimony
in
such
cases
to
attain
the
foregoing
objectives.
now,
i'll
skip
on
the
other
side,
insert
concerning
any
matter,
which
is
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
the
act
and
administration
of
the
service.
then
in
another
document,
entitled,
"initial
draft",
for
the
--
prepared
by
the
service
for
the
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
my
argument
is
this.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
my
answer
--
that
is
the
--
the
way
i
look
at
it
is
this.
the
service
is
that
this
additional
phrase
be
put
in.
it
wasn't
referred
in
the
act,
in
the
prior
act.
now,
they
gave
these
reasons
why
they
wish
to
have
that
particular
phrase
put
in,
and
they
so
stated
that
that's
the
theory.
and
then
other
piece
of
--
on
page
20,
the
additional
draft,
they
asked
--
they
put
it
this
way,
“in
addition,
this
subsection
contains
a
provision
permitting
inquirer
under
oath
and
by
subpoena
concerning
any
matter
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
in
the
administration
of
the
service.”
these
provisions
will
be
of
great
value
in
connection
with
such
matters
as
for
example,
investigation
of
applications
for
admission
to
practice
as
attorneys
or
representative
before
the
service
and
board
of
immigration
appeals.
now,
they
never
said
at
that
particular
time
that
if
--
that
is
if
i
can
conceive
--
if
your
question
was,
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
particular
phrase?
i'd
given
the
services
meaning.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
if
they
had
written
the
phrase,
this
investigating
phrase,
the
same
as
it's
written
in
all
the
other
agencies,
one
little
broad
sentence
that
simply
says,
“any
matter
under
investigation,”
that
would
be
enough
to
incumbent
as
the
word
denaturalization
proceedings
as
well
as
the
immigration.
but
where
they
have
specified
reenter,
privilege
of
a
person
to
enter,
reenter,
or
any
other
matter,
it
seems
that
by
specifying
certain
details,
the
principle
of
ejusdem
generis
and
then
following
with
or
any
other
matter
that
they
cannot
say,
“or
if
any
other
matter
is
greater
in
scope
than
what
precedes,'
plus,
their
own
--
their
own
reason
for
putting
that
phrase
in.
that
is
my
--
i
believe
my
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
now,
unfortunately,
the
various
courts
of
appeals,
in
construing
this
section,
didn't
have
access
to
these
documents.
a
very
vexing
problem
as
mr.
justice
jackson
has
printed
out
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
united
states
versus
the
public
utility
commission.
certainly,
it
might
well
advance
if
the
query
of
the
second
circuit
which
felt
the
words,
“concerning
any
matter
which
is
essential
or
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
and
the
administration
of
the
service
would
have
no
meaning.”
in
other
words,
they
felt
that
they
have
to
have
some
meaning,
and
since
that
phrase
by
itself
is
analogous
to
the
other
agency
provisions,
so
they
decided
on
that
basis.
as
judge
medina
quoted,
“there
are
these
significant
words
to
be
left
hanging
in
the
air
as
it
were,
and
given
no
effect
whatever,”
i
submit
that
there's
a
possibility
that
if
he
had
known
about
what
congress
themselves,
what
had
been
told
by
the
services,
but
there's
even
more
than
that
because
the
--
the
legislative
history
itself,
the
legislative
history
itself
shows
that
it
might
be
revealed
by
the
senate
and
house
reports,
it's
all
in
the
brief.
this
--
it
was
specifically
disclosed
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
this
provision
to
sanction
the
indiscriminate
questioning
or
harassment
of
citizens
returning
to
the
united
states,
but
it
was
only
to
be
used
by
immigration
officers
when
the
person
was
coming
into
the
united
states,
and
was
suspected
that
they
haven't
been
expatriated
which
of
course
would
be
automatic.
that
was
the
reason
why
they
changed
the
word,
"persons",
they
called
it
a
"privilege
of
persons"
lifting
it
bubbly
from
--
from
the
(inaudible)
case,
which
talked
about
the
privilege
of
--
of
aliens,
and
made
it
much
broader
which
they
had
a
right
to
do.
the
government
doesn't
argue
because
as
the
word,
“persons”
has
been
used
instead
of
aliens
that
have
encompass
the
citizens,
there
are
people
who
claimed
as
the
result
of
the
last
wars
that
they
are
citizens.
so,
this
is
perfectly
proper
for
congress
to
say,
“privilege
of
any
person
coming
in,
because
if
a
man
says
he's
a
citizen
and
they
are
stealth,
they
can
investigate,
they
can
subpoena.”
but
here,
there
is
no
doubt.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't,
i
want
to
relieve
the
government
of
at
least
one
burden.
in
fact,
the
only
burden
still
we
have
noticed,
a
registered
letter
was
sent
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization.
it's
on
page
4
of
the
record,
which
it
says,
“you
are
advised,
your
attendance
is
commanded
in
accordance
with
above
referred
to
subpoena,
in
order
that
you
may
give
testimony
in
connection
with
and
relating
to
the
possible
institution
of
proceedings
seeking
the
revocation
of
your
naturalization,
in
accordance
with
section
340,”
an
administrative
hearing,
in
order
to
find
that
they
have
enough
evidence
to
possibly
seek
his
revocation.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
if
the
court
pleases.
if
there
only
has
a
judgment,
and
we
submit
that
a
judgment
is
not
subject
to
that
collateral
attack
piece.
he
had
a
judgment
that
he
won
in
court
with
the
government
on
the
other
side
in
1945.
now,
to
say
that
they
would've
find
--
have
good
cause,
simply,
we
--
we
submit
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
we
--
we
don't
say
that
the
immigration
officers
have
no
right
to
go
out
and
investigate,
and
so
do
every
other
agency
and
citizen.
what
we
say
is
that
there
is
no
power
given
here
to
do
that
by
subpoena.
and
that
certainly
cannot
be
such
a
terrible
person
if
the
only
way
that
they
can
try
to
take
away
his
citizenship
is
by
words
from
his
own
mouth.
so
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
the
government
has
no
right
to
do
that
unless
there
is
a
good
cause.
mr.
jacob
kossman
this
is
--
this
is
something
that
they
can
only
do
on
a
rumor.
the
--
this
is
something
that
the
--
the
legislative
history
forbids
this.
but
besides
the
legislative
history
forbidding
this,
we
have
internal
evidence
in
the
statute
itself
which
--
which
shows
that
they
simply
don't
have
the
power.
now,
the
subpoena
power
is
usually
found
another
administrative
agency
in
a
separate
section.
you
have
it
under
evidence
or
investigation.
here,
we
have
jammed
in
a
section
that
deals
specifically
with
inspection
of
aliens.
now,
in
the
very
same
section,
there's
an
exact
provision,
words
for
word,
as
--
as
the
subpoena
sentence
except
that
the
subpoena
is
not
granted
and
the
word,
"persons"
is
used
instead
of
witnesses.
now,
that's
very
important
because
it
shows
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
distinction
between
subpoena
and
witnesses,
and
subpoena
and
persons.
here's
the
way
it's
written,
just
two
sentences
above
in
the
same
section.
the
attorney
general
and
the
immigration
officer
shall
have
power
to
administer
oaths
and
for
taking
considered
evidence
of
or
from
any
person.
they
don't
use
--
they
use
the
word
witness
in
the
subpoena
provision
to
sentences
later.
from
any
or
from
any
person
touching
the
privilege
of
any
alien
or
person
he
believes
or
suspects
to
be
an
alien,
to
enter,
reenter,
pass
through
or
reside
in
united
states,
or
concerning
any
matter
which
is
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
and
the
administration
of
the
service.
in
other
words,
you
have
exactly
the
same
provision
for
gathering
all
the
evidence
they
want
to,
minus
the
subpoena
provision.
when
they
give
you
the
subpoena
provision,
they
leave
--
they
changed
the
word
“persons”
to
“witnesses”.
now,
certainly,
the
normal
course,
the
normal
meaning
of
a
word
“witnesses”,
is
to
be
a
witness
against
someone
else.
this
court
has
in
cases
decided
in
view
of
the
nature
of
denaturalization
and
deportation.
the
word,
“entry”
doesn't
even
have
a
common
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
“entry".
now,
as
this
court
therefore
rather
decided
that
the
word
“witness”
doesn't
mean
witness,
but
means
witnessed
something
else.
now,
there
is
more
--
there
is
more
internal
evidence
which
shows
that
the
third
circuit
was
--
was
correct
in
their
interpretation.
in
all
the
other
agencies,
every
one
of
them,
there
is
a
subpoena
provision,
but
there's
only
one
subpoena
provision.
here,
what
do
we
find?
we
also
find
that
despite
the
contention
of
the
government
of
a
general
power
existed
in
section
235
(a),
that
congress
found
if
necessary
to
specifically
grant
the
subpoena
power
in
335
(b),
in
the
same
act
in
regard
to
pre-naturalization
examination.
now,
we
don't
find
separate
grants
of
powers
in
other
administrative
agencies,
it's
only
given
once.
once
is
enough.
now,
therefore,
we
have
a
right
to
contend
that
if
the
subpoena
power
under
section
235
(a)
as
applied
to
all
matters
connected
with
enforcement
of
the
act,
it
would
have
been
be
necessary
to
repeat
it
in
335
(b).
now,
the
government
very
cleverly
tries
to
distinguish
the
--
why
two
different
subpoenas
have
been
given.
they
said,
“oh,
one
is
investigating,
and
the
other
is
judicial,
quasi-judicial,
a
hearing.”
but
no
other
administrative
agency
has
two
different
subpoena
provisions
even
though
those
two
different
functions
exist.
so,
therefore,
going
to
the
internal
evidence
of
the
--
of
the
act,
we
say
that
it's
no
general
power
of
subpoena
granted
which
the
government
contends
and
which
they
only
establish
by
cut
now
half
with
asterisk.
mr.
jacob
kossman
none,
none.
mr.
jacob
kossman
none,
never,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
glad
the
court
calls
to
my
attention
because
there
was
--
i
have
a
little
memorandum
here.
back
--
back
in
1917,
there
was
a
provision
allowing
the
commissioner,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
to
institute
suit,
denaturalization.
that
was
taken
away
which
it
shows,
shows
that
congress,
as
far
as
--
when
it
comes
to
aliens,
congress
and
this
court
allows
practically
unlimited
power
in
--
in
handling
the
alien
situation.
it
comes
to
the
citizenship
and
revocation
of
citizenship.
it's
strictly
a
judicial
proposition.
mr.
jacob
kossman
in
section
340
of
this
act
and
it's
in
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
56,
56
in
the
government's
brief
where
it
said,
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
district
attorney."
now,
there's
another
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
correct.
there
is
not
a
single
word
or
syllable
in
the
entire
act,
except
for
section
340,
and
we
come
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
regulation
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
--
and
unless
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
unless
that
this
court
wishes
to
read
that
it's
in
235
(b)
by
virtue
of
that
or
any
other
matter
which
is
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
and
the
administration
of
the
service.
in
other
words,
this
court
will
have
to
reach
something
into
there,
which
the
service
never
contended
before
the
passage
of
the
act
existed,
and
which
congress
has
specifically
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
it's
just
the
opposite,
just
the
opposite.
i
have
quoted
in
the
brief
reports
of
congress,
the
house
and
senate
in
which
they
said
that
this
provision
must
not
be
used
to
harass
citizens.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
senator
mccarran
when
president
truman
had
vetoed
the
bill,
and
there
was
a
question
whether
the
--
he
said,
“there's
nothing
to
worry,”
senator
mccarran
paraphrasing
his
words.
he
said,
“there's
nothing
to
worry.
the
rights
of
private
citizens
aren't
going
to
be
involved
in
this
case.
the
immigration
inspectors
aren't
going
to
decide
whether
a
crime
has
been
committed.”
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that
is
correct.
they've
--
investigations
perhaps
but
not
subpoenaing
provisions.
mr.
jacob
kossman
the
investigative
power
might
come
from
the
senate
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
no,
i
couldn't
say
he
gave
it
specifically.
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
reach
something
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
--
i
had
not
granted,
nothing,
not
a
single
word
specifically.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct.
mr.
jacob
kossman
and
i
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
that's
correct,
and
i
deny
that
congress
has
the
power
to
--
to
give
that
to
administrative
legislation.
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
also,
the
separation
of
powers.
here,
you
have
a
collateral
attack
that
is
as
late
back
as
in
1830,
chief
justice
marshall
in
spratt
versus
spratt
says
you
can't
attack
a
judgment
and
a
judgment
of
naturalization
was
referring
to
by
collaterally.
what
do
i
have
there
to
question
a
--
a
naturalized
citizen
and
immigration
officer.
there's
something
in
congress
in
the
fact
that
a
citizen,
a
naturalized
citizen
has
to
appear
in
an
examining
room
to
defend
his
right
that
he
won
in
the
court
room,
but
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
well,
if
the
court
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
we
say
congress
didn't
grant
it
here,
and
i
also
say
that
if
congress
did
grant
it
here,
that
this
court
with
deference
i
believe
would
say
it
was
an
unconstitutional
plan.
now
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
but
--
well,
it's
here
now,
at
the
second
phase
of
that.
i
have
--
in
other
words
--
mr.
jacob
kossman
i
--
i'm
sustaining
that,
which
i
have
--
i
have
the
right
to
bring
up.
its
--
its
their
petition.
i
have
a
right
to
bring
up
anything
that
would
sustain
the
--
the
court
belows
verdict.
now,
i
have
to
call
what
mr.
justice
just
remarked
in
section
287
of
the
immigration
nationality
act.
they
specifically
defined
the
powers
of
the
immigration
officers
and
employees.
now,
certainly,
if
they
intended
to
give
the
subpoena
power
to
the
immigration
officers
for
denaturalization
purpose,
they
would've
mentioned
it
there.
well,
now,
the
exact
words
of
senator
mccarran
was,
“nothing
in
the
bill
which
would
permit
unreasonable
invasion
of
privacy
of
citizens
or
with
citizens
returning
from
abroad,”
because
someone
was
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
word
“persons”
had
been
used
instead
of
the
word
“witnesses.”
and
so,
it
doesn't
apply
to
citizens.
now,
there's
--
the
public
interest
can't
suffer.
in
the
recent
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
united
states
versus
vivian,
an
individual
subpoena
to
testify
against
someone
who
had
to
be
deported,
and
under
235
(b),
and
the
seventh
circuit,
mindful
of
the
minker
case,
which
was
not
cited
by
the
government,
and
mindful
of
the
barnes
case
which
uphold
the
government's
contention
which
was
cited
by
the
government,
therefore,
less
stated,
“we
don't
have
to
await
the
decision
of
this
court
on
those
two
because
--
on
those
two
cases
because
the
witness
is
not
a
party.”
so,
they've
decided
and
we
--
we
submit
there's
nothing
here
to
prevent
subpoenaing
witnesses
in
order
to
testify
against
aliens
and
--
and
people
to
be
deported
and
what
not.
and
the
seventh
circuit
takes
cognizance
of
that
view.
oh,
yes,
i
just
found
that
little
note.
in
1918,
denaturalization
laws
were
amended
to
allow
the
commissioner
of
naturalization
to
enter
suit
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
under
section
15,
but
this
was
deleted
in
1940.
so,
i
think
that's
a
little
bit
of
evidence.
in
other
words,
we
have
everything
which
shows
that
congress
did
not
--
did
not
wish
to
give
power
to
the
administrative
agency
to
subpoena
citizens
internally
and
externally.
mr.
jacob
kossman
yes,
but
in
the
old
section,
the
commissioner
had
the
power
to
institute
suit
of
immigration.
that
has
been
removed.
it's
only
the
district
attorney
who
can
do
that.
well,
i
thought
it
might
show
that
congress
has
eliminated
something.
certainly,
the
government
might
well
have
argued
that
the
commissioner
had
the
power
to
institute
suit
as
many
federal
--
many
federal
agents,
they
have
a
right
to
federal
trade
commission,
scc.
now,
there's
just
another
thought.
we
had
the
doctrine
of
the
actual
construction
of
statutes.
our
--
our
philosophy
is
that
in
this
type
of
case
that
we
see
what
the
spirit
is.
i
mean,
we
know
that
the
letter
of
the
law
kill
us
but
the
spirit
give
us
life.
and
in
this
kind
of
a
preceding,
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
to
avoid
the
harshness
that
would
come
about
as
a
result
of
delivering
millions
of
naturalized
citizens
into
the
hands
of
investigate
--
immigration
inspectors
who
don't
need
good
cause
in
order
to
wish
she
was
subpoenaed.
that's
a
tremendous
power
to
give
an
administrative
officer.
and
how
has
it
worked
out?
the
government's
brief
shows
in
1500
investigations
where
they
brought
in
individuals
that
they've
only,
i
think
20
or
30
revocations
have
resolved
it.
now,
certainly,
that's
too
great
power.
mr.
jacob
kossman
that,
i
--
i
wouldn't
know.
that
i
wouldn't
know.
there's
another
thought.
the
second
circuit,
when
they
decided
this
case,
they
didn't
know
that
the
third
circuit
had
decided
that
--
that
they
quoted
the
district
court
in
its
opinion,
although
the
district
court
had
been
reversed.now,
the
second
circuit
end
up
--
may
i
finish
it?
mr.
jacob
kossman
all
right.
the
second
circuit
in
their
opinion,
said,
“this
would
be
a
wonderful
being
in
order
to
help
find
subversives
in
the
country,”
although
they
dud
state
that
subversives
were
not
involved
in
the
particular
case.
now,
in
our
sociological
times,
i
mean
the
touchstone
of
interpretation
of
statutes
is
not
based
on
the
fact
as
to
whether
subversives
or
bad
people
may
lose
their
particular
citizenship.
we
submit
that
when
a
citizen
is
confronted
with
an
administrative
challenge
to
his
right
to
retain
his
citizenship
that
he
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
witness
within
the
meaning
of
section
235
(a),
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed.
the
constitutional
arguments
that
i
have
in
my
brief
only
come
into
play
if
this
court
feels
that
power
was
given
in
235
(a),
to
subpoena
naturalized
citizens.
