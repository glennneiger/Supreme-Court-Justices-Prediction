minker.
mr.
frankel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case
or
the
--
or
the
third
circuit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
frankel,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
happens
if
the
man
doesn't
respond
to
the
subpoena?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
it
informed,
it's
an
order
of
directing
obedience
to
the
subpoena.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
frankel,
i
suppose
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
the
--
the
government
would
have
the
right
to
take
the
testimony
of
this
witness
in
the
lawsuit
itself,
would
it
not
under
340?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
would
the
government
suffer
if
it
was
--
if
their
right
to
take
this
testimony
was
limited
to
the
lawsuit
that
it
provided
for
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
the
--
does
the
--
the
person
who's
being
investigated
have
the
benefit
of
a
court
to
--
to
advise
him
and
to
see
that
the
questions
that
were
asked
are
proper
or
--
or
is
it
just
this
immigration
officer
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
as
far
as
you
see,
the
government
would
suffer
no
injury
if
--
if
this
testimony
was
required
to
be
taken
in
this
lawsuit
where
it
would
be
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
seems
to
me,
the
government
has
provided
against
those
irresponsible
lawsuits
that
you
seem
to
fair
as
against
the
citizen
when
it
says
that
it
should
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorneys
with
respect
to
districts
upon
affidavit,
showing
that
cause
therefore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
kossman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
the
subpoenas,
mr.
kossman,
in
those
trade
commission
cases
from
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
same
thing
would
have
applied
to
a
congressional
investigation,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
finish
your
statement.

mr.
fay.
the
counsel
sitting
in
the
rear
of
the
room,
please
refrain
from
disturbing
the
court,
this
is
not
a
conference
room
and
there
is
a
place
for
that
for
the
lawyers,
please.
you
may
proceed
mr.
fay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
frankel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
initiating
proceedings
where
he
finds
wrong
doing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
--
i'm
asking
the
--
i'm
asking
about
the
veterans'
administrator.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
how
about
the
--
how
about
the
administrator
of
affair
--
of
the
wage
and
labor
with
the
power.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
wouldn't
do
that,
would
he
not,
under
the
specific
command
of
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
such
command
in
this
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
mean
the
naturalization
commissioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
are
speaking
of
whom
now,
the
--
the
attorney
general
or
the
commissioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
speaking
of
whom,
the
attorney
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
that
isn't
the
question.
it
isn't
the
attorney
general
who
has
subpoenaed
this
man,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
frankel,
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
just
one
question
to
get
to
your
position
clear.
let's
take
an
entirely
different
field
from
immigration.
but
a
field
over
which
the
attorney
general
has
a
jurisdiction
or
investigating
and
initiating
prosecutions
or
--
or
some
kind
of
civil
action.
would
he
have
the
right
to
delegate
to
the
fbi,
for
instance,
the
right
to
issue
subpoenas
and
compel
people
to
come
in
and
testify
before
that
agency
in
the
absence
of
specific
language
authorizing
him
to
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
well,
then
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
that
clearly
from
this
situation
that
we
have
here?
if
--
if
the
naturalization
act
does
not
give
the
immigration
commissioner
jurisdiction
over
the
denaturalization
of
citizens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
now
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
point
where
--
that's
the
point
where
--
where
we
--
we
break.
does
the
commissioner
of
immigration
have
the
right
to
initiate
a
proceeding
for
denaturalization?
if
you
--
if
you
tell
me
that
he
does,
that
will
solve
a
great
problem
for
me
but
in
the
absence
of
such
a
right,
i'm
in
trouble
on
this
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
see.
