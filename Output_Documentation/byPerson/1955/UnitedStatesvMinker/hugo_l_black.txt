do
you

but
you
wouldn't
in

would
you?
justice

black
i
thought
you
said
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
had
the

does
this

in
summoning
a

to
appear

agency,
or
i

this

who

(voice

black
that
these

they

black
well,
the
--
justice

l.
black
is
there
any
indication
--
are
there
--
there
maybe
in
this
act
that
the
word
witness
was
intended
to
be
used
broad
enough
to
cover
any
person,
accept
one
summon
to
participate
as
a
witness
in
some
kind
of
hearing
that
was
authorized
by
law.
i
mean
the
statute
because
i
haven't
read
the
(inaudible)
but
the
witness
says
i
have
always
understood
it,
generally
referred
to
a
person
summoned
to
give
testimony
in
some
kind
of
hearing,
either
administrative

or
judicial.

if
the

finds
and
it
summons
somebody
and
notify
them
to
appear

are
they

the
general
meaning
of
the
term
if
they
want
to
make
an
investigation?
notify
somebody
to
appear
before
them,
do
they
--
do
they
appear
as
witnesses
or
do
they
appear
just
because
they're
notified?
the
word
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
have
is
witnesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
that
indicates
in
this
act
that
persons
are
--
are
to
be
classified
as
witnesses,
were
asked
to
do
nothing
but
come
and
give
as
some
kind
of
evidence
not
in
a
hearing
of
any
kind
but
to
be
used
by
some
kind
of
executive
agents
here
to
get
some
kind
of
proof
to
be
used
in
some
hearing
conducted
somewhere
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'm
talking
--
i'm
talking
about
the
kind
of
place,
they
are
summoned
to
talk
in.
either
this
is
a
--
the
word
witness
usually
limited
to
one
who's
notified
to
appear
and
give
evidence
or
testimony
in
a
proceeding
or
is
it
--
does
it
include
generally
people
who
are
notified
to
appear
before
an
executive
agent
and
share
for
deputy
share
of
fbi
or
someone,
simply
to
give
them
some
information
so
that
they
can
use
it
in
connection
with
use

getting
them
later
to
serve
as
witnesses
in
a
hearing
which
is
--
which
isn't
used
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do?
now,
which
part
of
this
act
gives
the
authority
to
summon
a
witness,
call
a
person
a
witness
who
is
merely
to
give
information
to
be
used
by
an
executive
officer
who
has
no
authority
to
conduct
the
hearing?
justice

no,
i
had

i
had
your

here

i

i
don't
know
which
part

in
your

now,
to
do
any
petition
for
certiorari
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
which
part
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
immigration
officers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
what
now,
concerning
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
agency
given
them
power
in
the
act
to
hold
hearings
in
connection
with
those
who
enter,
reenter,
reside
in,
or
pass
through
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
authorized
and
to
hold
those
hearings
with
reference
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
were
they
authorized
the
hold
hearings
with
reference
to
denaturalizing
citizens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
have
final
power,
do
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
final
power
to
hold
hearings
and
conducts
here
investigative
hearings
to
reach
a
final
decision
subject
to
courts
to
such
judicial
reviews
it
has
concerning
all
of
these
matters
here
that
aliens
residing
in
and
so
forth
that
are
mentioned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
do
not
have
any
power
at
all
with
reference
to
denaturalizing
citizens.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
same
thing
to
be
said
about
the
fbi,
wasn't
it?
they
are
--
they
are
supposed
to
get
up
the
information
and
give
to
the
--
to
the
--
for
the
enforcement
of
that
law
and
whether
it's
all
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
this
a
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
the
attorney
general's
order,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
66,
that's
the
attorney
general's
order
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
a
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
purport
to
give
the
immigration
officers
any
authority
to
denaturalize
citizens
or
to
try
cases
against
them
in
any
way
and
to
hold
hearings
against
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
they
were
broadening
it.
did
they
indicate
in
any
way
that
the
immigration
department
could
conduct
the
hearings,
preliminary
hearings
or
any
other
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
had
a
duty,
i
suppose,
it's
like
the
duty
of
the
sheriff
and
policeman
and
the
fbi
to
get
at
aliens.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
fact
here
usually
look
to
deputy
sheriffs
and
policemen,
required
warrants
and
find
a
good
cause
would
--
would
authorize
them
ordinarily
without
statutory
authority
to
summon
people
to
testify
before
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
can
--
if
you
can
find
specific
language
in
the
act
like
that,
that
i
think
is
still
is,
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
i
have
some
recollections
there.
and
i
think
it's
very,
very,
very
specific
to
amend
investigatory
power
as
to
what
it
--
what
they'd
investigate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
but
it
does
have
to
speak
clearly,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
something
before
that
though
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
that
we
put
the
attorney
general
which
the
immigration
department
has
a
great
deal
of
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
hold
on.
your
argument
there,
is
it
done
necessarily
to
say
that
anything
that
the
immigration
board
wants
to
do
has
to
do
any
duty
it
has
to
perform,
any
kind
or
character,
they
can
summon
witnesses,
any
witness
who
might
know
anything
about
what
they
want
to
investigate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
if
there's
a
similar
practice
of
investigations
by
the
immigration
department
in
connection
with
alleged
crimes
committed
by
aliens
and
by
naturalized
citizens
in
connection
with
their
obtaining
evidences.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
could
be,
couldn't
he,
under
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
whole
duty
as
to
investigate
with
reference
to
a
crime
as
i
understand
it,
to
investigate
something
like
the
old
prohibition
and
use
it
here,
crimes
under
the
prohibition
law.
under
your
argument,
i
--
i
suppose
that
the
agency
would
necessarily
have
power
to
summon
any
--
any
witnesses
it
saw
fit,
subpoena
him
to
give
evidence
so
that
you
could
prepare
your
investigation
to
prosecute
the
man
for
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
investigate
those
crimes
against
the
immigration
law
besides
the
--
the
fbi
who
investigates
other
crimes,
do
they
not?
and
to
prepare
them
for
charges
and
trials.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
like
the
post
office
inspectors
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
the
post
office
inspectors,
do
they
have
authority
to
summon
people
before
them
to
give
evidence
in
connection
with
crimes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
think
of
any
reason
of
policy
which
would
justify
giving
that
power
to
the
immigration
board
in
connection
with
investigative
power?
it
wouldn't
likewise
apply
to
giving
the
same
power
to
the
fbi.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
could
be
if
your
position
is
sustained
for
denial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
know
a
distinction
between
the
two,
logically?
