justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
on
the
brief,
i
don't
know
if
the
first
--
your
first
question
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
it's
controverted
by
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
happened
merely
as
a
matter
of
construction,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
no
possession
of
any
constitution
of
difficulty
which
might
lead
one
way
or
the
other
in
construction
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
refuse
it.
refuse
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
scheme
is
--
this
--
this
is
a
scheme
based
on
the
brimson,
the
procedure
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
originally
formulated
the
interstate
commerce
act
they
have
stated
in
the
brimson
case,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
generally
or
particularly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
was
the
--
what
does
it
say
to
you
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
it's
fair.
it
is
a
fair
inference
or
was
it
there
--
wasn't
fair
inference
that
the
original
subpoena
is
in
notice
that
the
inquiry
for
the
record
sought
to
legality
of
the
citizenship
and
therefore
was
directed
upon
the
denaturalization
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
that
--
i
thought
that
the
explication
of
what
the
subject
matter
was,
they
told
him
as
much,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
it's
calculated
for
the
free
denaturalization?
is
that
the
objection
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
accept
yours
for
the
--
for
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
it
faces,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
would
like
to
ask
you
is
whether
in
the
other
administrative
subpoenas,
the
icc,
the
scc,
that
is
the
normal
terminal
of
the
inquiry,
whether
those
inquiry
--
certainly,
that
doesn't
prove
the
icc
as
i
put
it
on
that,
that
it's
somehow
through
this
case.
but
as
to
the
other,
these
are
investigations.
would
it
make
a
difference
even
though
there
has
any
case
come
up
in
which
in
an
investigation
by
the
scc
or
to
the
icc
and
a
man
is
asked
to
appear
before
the
icc
or
the
scc,
the
examiner
at
a
time
that
to
his
knowledge,
he's
committed
under
investigation
by
the
grand
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
an
instance
where
a
man
is
deemed
to
be
a
witness
in
the
general
--
in
a
general
class,
a
witness
at
a
time
in
the
deportation
of
defendants.
now,
i'm
well
aware
that
--
i'm
not
a
--
i'm
well
aware
that
a
denaturalization
proceedings
not
a
criminal
proceeding,
in
that
sentence.
i'm
also
aware
that
if
something
partaking
a
very
serious
consequence,
and
therefore,
the
proceeding
is
really
directed
against
the
deprivation
of
an
important,
something
there
before
of
great
importance.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
word
“witness”
is
--
is
the
relevant
or
descriptive,
appropriate
word
for
witness,
who
he
is,
a
potential
defendant,
either
in
a
criminal
situation,
a
criminal
proceeding
or
in
a
proceeding
like
denaturalization.
all
of
this
is
a
matter
of
construction,
whether
when
we
--
when
authorities
give
it
to
summon
witnesses
is
a
natural
dealing
of
the
word
to
cover
a
person
who
will
find
himself
next
week
in
all
likelihood
to
defend
him
of
denaturalization
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
all
i
am
suggesting
is
there
may
be
differences,
not
in
a
manner
of
constitutional
law,
but
in
a
manner
of
construction
that
this
is
a
statute.
it's
about
--
it
isn't
a
statute
directed
toward
deprivation
there
before
his
rights.
the
other
administrative
subpoena
so-called
are
very
appropriate
facilities
for
the
inquiry
instances,
industrial
activity,
economical
activity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
particular
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
particularly
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
particularly
why
would
be
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
trouble,
because
i'm
going
to
(inaudible)
because
the
subpoena
doesn't
disclose
of
what
it's
about
and
i
raise
the
difficulty
that
the
subpoena
disclose
it
all
too
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
kind
of
investigation
in
order
to
find
out
whether
it
should
be
put
into
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
don't
deny
--
you
don't
deny
power
of
congress
to
--
to
provide
for
an
investigation
before
the
legal
officers
of
government
find
a
piece
of
paper
and
impart
a
petitioner
or
give
a
magazine,
or
whatever
it
was.
you're
denying
that
they
can
have
a
prejudicial
investigatory
power
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
there
should
be
a
judicial
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
generality
derived
as
incumbent
from
the
convict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
based
on
a
judgment
and
you're
sustaining
it
on
a
constitutional
objection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
part
of
--
is
that
old
section
15
through
the
present
law
under
this
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
seen
--
i've
seen
very
serious
discussion
whether
governor,
certainly
not
participating
having
been
born
in
paris.
but
he
stated
specifically
in
connection
with
possibilities
and
to
--
would
you
mind
telling
us.
i
mean
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
justice
reed
right
about
it,
as
in
questions
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
might
have
been
in
paris,
his
origin
for
naturalized
citizens
brought
as
a
child.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
you
or
anybody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you
have
said
--
or
indeed
anybody
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
isn't
one
thing
for
congress
to
define
explicitly
or
perhaps
the
best
to
authorize
an
official
like
the
attorney
general
by
a
regulation
to
set
up
an
investigatory
process
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
another
source.
or
officer
of
united
states
in
charge
of
investigating
whatever
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
come
and
talk
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
talk
to
him
because
i
don't
want
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
your
--
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
has
--
the
--
the
investigation
may
result
in
conclusions
which
are
duly
here
and
which
would
duly
notify
--
would
be
before
us.
and
the
only
thing
is
this
one,
the
thing
gets
to
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
deny
--
i'm
not
denying
what
you
refer.
i'm
merely
questioning
what
you
deny
to
be
sure
from
in
criminal
prosecution.
but
am
i
wrong
in
saying
that
with
one
exception
about
which
i'm
not
informed,
and
you
tell
me,
every
blessed
one
of
the
investigative
subpoena
provisions
included
on
your
page
41,
relate
to
agencies.
i
take
it,
none
of
which
under
the
humphrey
doctrine,
members
of
none
of
which
could
be
dismissed
by
a
person
the
united
states
in
the
humphrey
doctrine
against
an
act
of
congress
in
giving
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
was
so,
they
all
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let's
have
a
great
provision
listed
down
the
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that,
i
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i
hope
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
don't
mind
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
said
with
the
exception
of
the
veterans
administrator
about
which
i
don't
know
and
about
--
actually,
you
might
be
right.
i'm
not
sure,
i'm
not
sure
but
--
or
all
the
evidence,
i
should
think
formal
in
the
humphrey
doctrine.
look
at
federal
trade
commission,
security
exchange
for
the
holding
company,
i
don't
throw
in
that
like
interrelations
act.
they're
all
agencies
of
very
considerable
administrative
distinction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
of
which
--
all
of
which
have
so-called
quasi
adjudicatory
functions,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
may
be
decides
--
may
be
veteran
administration
in
your
brief
to
41,
the
page
41
which
are
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
the
one.
it
may
be
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
an
impressive
footnote,
but
when
i
came
to
think
about
it,
it
means
the
--
the
--
appears
in
my
mind,
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to
make
that
these
are
very
different
bodies
with
very
different
functions,
although
of
course,
as
to
each
one,
criminal
statutes
are
probably
in
the
statutes
which
would
require
initiation
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
is
that,
this
having
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
notice
they
--
you
--
it
might
en
jeopardize
any
projection
of
fore
findings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
even
more
careful
next
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
a
lot
of
stuff
in
the
provision
which
cover
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
strange
if
you
would
speak
of
it
of
merely
--
gives
some
other
influence
to
follow
enforcement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
didn't
mean
the
amendments
and
what
it
said
about
and
what
we
--
but
the
service
wouldn't
think
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
yes
but
this
is
the
obvious
one
in
the
act
as
to
your
subversive
pursuance,
judge
medina,
preoccupation
depriving
of
the
department
and
occasionally
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
his
preoccupation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
naturalization
act
was
or
was
(inaudible)
made
substantive
changes
with
regard
to
denaturalization,
the
bearer
in
the
old
section
13
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever,
i
forget
that
that's
the
(inaudible)
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
this
act,
but
the
--
what
was
the
naturalization
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
40.
all
right,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
act
of
1952
weighed
substantively
to
steer
it
against
the
potential
--
the
potentially
denaturalized
citizens?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
was
because
of
the
old
controversy
by
the
extreme
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
substantively.
