motion

what?
justice
stanley
reed
motion
to
quash
what?
justice
stanley
reed
which
had
been
issued
by
the
immigration
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
and
not
to
quash
the
action
of
the
court
compelling
him
to
appear.
justice
stanley
reed
he
made
the
motion
to
quash
in
the
district
court?
justice
stanley
reed
until
that,
there
was
a
subpoena
that
had
no
compulsive
power?
justice
stanley
reed
and
then
he
made
a
motion
to
quash
it.
now,
that's
--
justice
stanley
reed
why
--
why
would
he
pay
any
attention
to
it
at
all?
justice
stanley
reed
what
if
there's
no
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
mr.
frankel,
is
there
any
distinction
between
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
and
--
and
the
proceeding
of
--
of
deporting
a
man
or
excluding
him,
those
being
administrative
proceedings
only
but
--
but
this
section
340
provides
for
a
judicial
proceeding
to
--
to
cancel
the
citizenship
of
a
--
of
a
person?
and
not
only
that,
but
it
states
how
the
judicial
proceeding
shall
be
initiated.it
shall
be
initiated
upon
affidavit,
showing
good
cause
therefore
by
the
united
states
attorneys.
now,
isn't
there
a
distinction
between
those
two
kinds
of
proceedings
so
--
so
that
the
--
the
subpoena
power
in
taking
a
testimony
of
witnesses
in
the
administrative
procedure
might
be
different
from
that
in
--
under
this
act?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
mr.
frankel,
on
--
on
page
5
of
the
--
of
the
record,
that
is
as
i
understand
is
the
order
directing
mr.
minker
to
appear.
justice
stanley
reed
now,
before
that,
he
had
--
had
the
proceeding,
which
he
sought
to
quash
the
subpoena.
justice
stanley
reed
and
on
its
phase,
that
order
doesn't
give
him
any
notice
of
what
this
is
going
to
be,
why
it's
become?
justice
stanley
reed
it
refers
to
the
fact
that
as
the
matter
of
abraham
minker
would
respond
that
he's
notified
to
appear.
now,
is
it
your
argument
that
he
was
told
in
the
--
in
that
former
proceeding
where
he
moved
to
quash
the
original
subpoena
because
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
i
think,
from
what
you
said.
justice
stanley
reed
that
--
that's
where
he
learned
about
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
what
it
was?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
--
well,
this
is
an
--
an
answer
to
subpoena,
is
it?
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
he's
ordered
to
appear.
justice
stanley
reed
it's
the
only
--
it's
the
subpoena
that
has
any
piece
to
it.
justice
stanley
reed
and
--
and
yet,
it
doesn't
show
what
he's
to
appear
for.
justice
stanley
reed
they
try
to
find
out
because
they
have
been
informed.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
same
statute,
to
put
the
duty
on
the
district
attorneys
institute
denaturalization
proceedings
on
that
charge
so
that
they
won't
be
able
to
find
out
that
they're
interested
so
that
they're
going
to
take
away
the
subpoena.
justice
stanley
reed
i'd
like
to
do
that
(inaudible)
--
the
only
difference
between
you
and
the
government,
exactly
it
is.
the
government
will
be
advised
to
cross-petition,
the
denaturalization
that
they
would
assert
it
was
a
good
cause.
justice
stanley
reed
right.
justice
stanley
reed
many
cases
have
been
barred.
justice
stanley
reed
the
act
--
the
act
applies
to
every
citizen
of
the
united
states,
doesn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
if
they're
--
if
they're
naturalized
or
natural
born.
justice
stanley
reed
why
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
it's
simply
that
--
justice
stanley
reed
investigatory
--
justice
stanley
reed
just
as
every
citizen
could
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
constitution
is
made
of.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
constitution
made.
justice
stanley
reed
well
--
justice
stanley
reed
who
makes
the
--
who
--
who
furnishes
the
information
to
the
district
attorney
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
to
the
procedings
they
brought?
justice
stanley
reed
this
investigation
is
to
get
that
evidence,
wasn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
that
but
this
particular
exception,
235
(a),
is
intended
to
give
an
opportunity
for
the
immigration
service
to
gather
the
evidence
that
they're
going
to
present
to
the
district
attorney,
isn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
what
they
thought.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that's
this
section
does
purport
to
arrange
for
the
immigration
service
to
gather
evidence.
i'm
not
using
the
word
subpoena.
justice
stanley
reed
in
order
to
submit
it
to
the
united
states
attorney,
doesn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
is
this,
mr.
fay,
the
nature
of
grand
jury
proceeding?
justice
stanley
reed
then
they
have
three
subpoenas?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
they
were
voluntary,
weren't
they?
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
in
--
in
denaturalization,
does
it
--
every
--
is
it
always
requisite
that
there
should
have
been
a
crime
committed
by
the
person
who
--
who's
denaturalized?
justice
stanley
reed
not
at
all,
no.
justice
stanley
reed
but
would
--
would
--
could
he
obtain
a
--
a
naturalization
certificate,
which
would
be
subject
to
be
withdrawn
unless
he
had
committed
some
crime
in
--
in
obtaining
and
sworn
falsely
as
misrepresented
his
age
and
so
forth
or
his
locality
from
which
he
came?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
in
terms
of
the
protection,
he
may
have
when
he
went
before
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
establishment.
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
that
and
it
is
because
of
that
that
i'm
asking
whether
any
inquiry
could
be
made
and
would
not
lead
to
criminal
prosecution
if
possible.
