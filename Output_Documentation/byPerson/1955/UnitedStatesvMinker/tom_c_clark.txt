you
said
administrative
subpoena,
is
the
subpoena
here?
is
the
subpoena
in
the
record?
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
he
--
was
he
summoned
to
appear
before
the
administrative
hearing?
justice
tom
c.
clark
why,
would
it
to
be?
was
anybody
to
be
there,
with
him,
and
the
officer?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
there
any
provision
in
the
act
unless
--
any
provision
in
the
act
which
specifically
gives
the
board
or
the
immigration
official
power
and
authority
to
conduct
hearing
in
connection
with
denaturalization?
justice
tom
c.
clark
has
there
ever
been?
justice
tom
c.
clark
where
has
--
where
has
congress
placed
the
power
for
denaturalization?
justice
tom
c.
clark
page
56
of
the
government's
brief,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about,
section
340?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
only
part
of
the
act
which
specifically
grant
authority
to
conduct
any
kind
of
administrative
or
any
kind
of
hearing
in
reference
to
denaturalization?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
this
is
found
in
the
general
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
original
clause
to
which
reference
has
been
made,
or
any
other
proceedings
under
this
act?
justice
tom
c.
clark
unless
it's
in
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
anything
in
the
report
to
the
committees
or
the
hearings
that
you
know
of
that
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
give
denaturalization
power
hearings
to
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
are
arguing
as
i
gather
it
that
congress
has
given
four
hours
to
the
administrative
agency
to
make
all
kinds
of
investigation
about
aliens?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
to
summon
aliens.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
has
not
expressly
granted
power
anywhere
in
this
bill
or
any
bill
in
the
past
to
conduct
to
administrative
hearings
and
subpoena
citizens.
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
connection
with
denaturalization.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
as
the
investigative
power?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
has
that
been
given
specifically?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
i'm
just
trying
to
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
comes
you
suppose
from
the
general
power
to
investigate
with
reference
to
aliens
that
you
denied
that
that
can
be
applied
to
citizens.
justice
tom
c.
clark
until
the
--
at
least
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
as
long
as
they're
citizens?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you're
going
on
this
court's
opinion
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
they're
entitled
to
due
process.
is
that
what
you
want?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not,
maybe
--
maybe
it
might
no
be
in
congress.
the
question
is,
did
congress
grant
it
here
as
told?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you're
not
raising
a
constitutional
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
not
here
now.
justice
tom
c.
clark
just
to
say,
those
citizens,
if
this
subpoena
this
--
subpoena
these
witnesses.
justice
tom
c.
clark
say
the
citizens,
would
you
say
that
be
subpoenaed
in
the
act
to
be
there
as
witness
if
they
would
not
be
there
as
parties.
you
can't
denaturalize
the
natural-born
citizens.
you
couldn't
have
it
just
as
citizen,
a
natural-born
citizen
would
be
comparable
to
this
one.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
thought
that
the
counsel
on
the
previous
case,
as
based
on
his
fact,
here
you're
bringing
in
the
party
to
which
the
--
more
than
the
fact
that
he's
a
citizen.
justice
tom
c.
clark
there
is
a
subpoena
section,
isn't
it,
mr.
fay,
in
section
--
page
66
of
your
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
section
287,
part
four.
then
you
may
ask
and
the
words
only
says,
they
may
issue
be
as
advised,
this
in
connection.
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
--
not
any
other
--
not
any
overruling
statute
to
give
the
fbi
the
power
to
subpoena,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
don't
attack
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
regulation,
do
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
don't
attack
that
regulation
and
you
think
it
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
that's
in
any
proceedings,
you
have
to
say
that
investigation
to
given
that
denaturalization
without
proceeding,
i
suppose.
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
i
read
the
stipulation
though
that
alien
from
any
party
which
is
interested
in
the
proceeding
would
issue
a
subpoena,
rather
asks
for
expedition
as
part
of
this
directly
--
and
directly
to
manage
himself.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
only
thing
and
definitely
thing
it's
said
on
then
--
you
can
--
would
be
in
order
to
find
this
at
all
or
determine
whether
is
at
all
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
whether
if
you'd
file
--
filing
the
suit
in
court.
