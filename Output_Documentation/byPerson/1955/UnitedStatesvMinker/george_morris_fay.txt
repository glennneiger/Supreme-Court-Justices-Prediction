mr.
george
morris
fay
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
the
companion
case
of
united
states
versus
minker.
the
questions
are
similar
to
the
questions
presented
in
that
case.
the
facts
in
the
instant
case
might
be
briefly
examined
before
and
claim
into
my
argument.
the
two
petitioners
here,
salvatore
and
joseph
falcone,
were
brothers.
they
were
born
in
italy
and
immigrated
to
this
country
in
1907
with
their
parents.
they
were
naturalized
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
1925.
they
continued
to
live
in
this
country
thereafter.
in
1952,
the
petitioner,
salvatore
falcone,
was
residing
in
florida.
he
was
away
from
the
city
and
his
residence
at
the
time
when
an
immigration
officer
visited
there
and
left
words
that
when
he
returned,
he
should
report
to
the
immigration
office.
he
voluntarily
went
down
upon
his
returning
to
the
city.
he
submitted
--
he
was
informed
that
a
charge
have
been
made
against
him
that
he
was
an
alien.
he
submitted
his
naturalization
certificate
and
at
that
time,
he
answered
all
questions
that
were
propounded
to
him
by
this
hearing
officer.
seven
months
later,
he
received
a
letter
from
the
immigration
office,
telling
him
to
come
in
again
and
to
bring
with
him
his
naturalization
certificate
on
an
official
manner.
he
again
appeared,
tendered
his
certificates
and
answered
all
questions
that
were
propounded
to
him
at
that
time
by
the
immigration
officer.
simultaneously
in
utica,
new
york,
his
brother,
petitioner
joseph,
had
received
an
identical
letter
for
his
appearance
at
the
utica
office
on
the
same
day
that
salvatore
was
appearing
in
florida.
he
also
appeared.
he
appeared
with
counsel
and
propounded
to
question
to
the
examiner
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry.
he
was
refused
any
explanation.
and
on
the
advice
of
counsel,
he
refused
to
make
a
statement
as
requested
by
the
hearing
officer.
two
months
later
in
june
of
1953,
the
petitioner
joseph
falcone
was
served
with
a
subpoena
in
a
nature
of
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
bring
with
him
his
certificate
of
naturalization,
his
birth
certificate,
and
his
certificate
of
entry
to
this
country.
he
again
appeared
at
the
office
of
immigration
service
with
counsel.
counsel,
at
that
time,
informed
the
hearing
officer
that
they
were
appearing
specially
to
question
the
validity
of
the
subpoena
with
respect
to
its
direction
against
a
citizen
of
this
country.
at
the
same
time,
counsel
voluntarily
submitted
for
examination,
aside
from
the
subpoena,
the
certificates
of
naturalization,
original
entry
and
birth
certificate.
but
after
further
questioning
by
the
hearing
officer
and
the
insistence
on
counsel
that
the
petitioner
joseph
should
not
answer
the
questions,
the
hearing
was
terminated.
at
that
stage,
the
counsel
for
petitioner,
joseph
falcone,
asked
if
he
could
have
the
right
to
purchase
a
transcript
of
the
stenographic
notes
that
were
taken
at
the
hearing.
he
was
refused
that
right
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
confidential
records
of
the
united
states
government.
it
couldn't
be
furnished
to
him.
ten
days
later,
his
brother,
petitioner
salvatore,
received
an
identical
subpoena.
the
court
already
knows
how
that
subpoena
is
worded,
in
re
salvatore
falcone.
no
explanation
on
the
face
of
the
subpoena
as
to
the
purpose
or
the
nature
of
the
investigation.
he
also
appeared
at
the
office
with
counsel
and
raised
a
special
plea
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
immigration
officer
to
subpoena
him
there
for
questioning.
he
too,
tendered
his
naturalization
certificate
to
prove
that
he
was
a
citizen.
thereafter,
in
september
of
1953,
the
united
states
attorney
moved
in
district
court
for
an
order
to
show
cause
why
this
subpoena
should
not
be
enforced.
there
was
a
hearing
before
district
court
judge
foley
in
utica,
new
york.
the
evidence
was
all
presented
and
judge
foley
ruled
at
that
time
and
his
opinion
appears
at
page
26
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
in
number
47.
judge
foley
refused
to
enforce
these
subpoenas.
and
he
predicated
his
refusal,
"on
the
ground
that
the
limitation
of
this
administrative
subpoena
power
in
my
judgment
must
be
kept
within
the
confines
of
the
provisions
as
stated
and
restricted
to
such
purpose.
and
there's
not
the
slightest
indication
in
the
legislative
background,
nor
the
terms
of
the
provisions
that
it
may
be
used
for
the
investigative
purpose
here
sought
against
a
naturalized
citizen."
the
language
appearing
on
page
32
of
the
record.
then
going
over
to
page
34,
he
concluded
that
if
the
subpoena
here
were
allowed
to
stand,
the
judicial
procedure
for
the
--
revocation
of
naturalization
certificates
would
be
preempted
by
administrative
action.
and
the
provisions
for
personal
notice,
60-day
time
period
to
answer
in
section
340
(a)
of
the
act
would
be
empty
words.
thus,
it's
apparent
that
the
facts
in
the
instant
case
differ
slightly
from
those
in
the
minker
case.
here,
there
was
compliance
by
these
two
citizens
with
this
form
of
command
that
was
issued
by
the
immigration
service.
in
the
minker
case,
it
was
a
motion
to
crush
the
subpoena
which
ended
in
a
contempt
citation
when
the
respondent
refused
to
appear
as
ordered
by
the
district
court.
this
case
was
taken
by
the
government
to
the
second
circuit.
and
that
circuit
ruled
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
deciding
that
the
subpoena
should
not
be
enforced.
and
the
circuit
predicated
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
the
arm
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
would
be
strengthened
if
the
court
was
to
read
a
broad
interpretation
into
the
language
of
section
235
(a),
and
that
the
immigration
service
would
more
readily
be
in
a
good
position
to
fair
it
out
subversives
or
those
who
were
seeking
under
a
cloak
of
recent
citizenship
to
do
injury
to
our
government.
they've
conceded
as
the
record
compel
them
to
do
so
that
there
was
no
evidence
or
even
any
inference
that
the
petitioners,
salvatore
or
joseph
falcone,
had
any
knowledge
of
or
any
participation
in
--
subversive
activities
of
any
kind
whatsoever.
now,
counsel
for
the
respondent
minker
has
dwelt
on
the
internal
construction
of
section
235
(a)
and
of
the
act
as
a
whole
as
a
guide
for
the
interpretation
of
the
power
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
administrative
agency
by
the
words
which
have
been
added
to
section
235
(a).
counsel
pointed
out
that
in
changing
the
word
person
from
alien,
there
was
no
intent
to
enlarge
it
to
the
extent
that
would
include
citizen.
that
in
using
the
word
privilege,
the
congress
amply
used
the
word
that
necessarily
applies
to
the
position
of
the
alien
as
he
stands
in
this
country
but
has
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
position
of
the
citizen
who
certainly
has
a
right,
not
a
privilege
to
reside
in
the
united
states.
and
finally,
that
the
word
witness
as
used
by
the
congress
in
the
statute
didn't
necessarily
in
its
common
accepted
terms
and
certainly
in
this
field
of
an
area
of
privacy
much
more
restricted
than
in
regulatory
statutes
or
economic
activities
of
business.
and
that
accordingly,
that
congress
never
intended
the
word
witness
to
mean
a
party
who
would
be
subject
to
a
revocation
act
at
a
later
day.
finally,
respondent
counsel
has
argued
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
section
235
that
necessarily
would
result
in
a
restrictive
use
of
that
particular
proviso.
petitioner
now,
assuming
that
section
235
(a)
is
as
broad
as
the
government
contends,
would
like
to
point
out
the
power
that
necessarily
flows
from
such
an
interpretation
into
the
evasion
of
the
privacy
of
citizens.
there
was
mentioned
in
the
fact
that
there
are
over
8
million
naturalized
citizens
in
this
country.
it
seems
not
unreasonable
to
plea.
mr.
george
morris
fay
well,
counsel
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
well,
if
the
broadest
interpretation
was
given
to
the
words,
it
could
be
conceivably
extended
to
that
extent.
mr.
george
morris
fay
but
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
it
could
practically
be
extended
to
that
extent,
your
honor,
yes.
but
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
concept
of
what
congress
was
dealing
with
here,
namely,
the
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
naturalization
certificates
of
citizens
who
acquired
it
by
naturalization,
i
suppose
to
the
natural-born
citizen.
mr.
george
morris
fay
it
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
it
is
conceivable
that
this
statute
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
can
be
used
to
subpoena
him.
mr.
george
morris
fay
and
if
this
section
235
is
given
the
broad
contention
that
the
government
claims
for
it,
it
is
quite
possible
that
he
could
be
subpoenaed
to
answer
that
query.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
believe,
yes.
but
i
draw
a
distinction
between
the
power
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
intrinsically
from
the
constitution
to
subpoena
in
relation
to
its
investigatory
power
as
to
the
power
which
they
in
turn
can
delegate
to
administrative
agencies
that
might
invade
other
constitutional
rights
of
the
individual.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
george
morris
fay
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i'm
sorry,
i
missed
the
first
part
of
your
sentence
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
think
the
distinction
is
well
taken,
your
honor,
but
i
still
believe
that
under
the
--
the
235
(a),
have
given
the
broad
construction
contended
for
by
the
government
that
the
citizen,
whether
a
natural
--
denaturalized
or
american
born,
would
be
subject
to
the
subpoena
and
would
have
to
come
in
to
prove
his
naturalization
status
or
his
native-born
status.
mr.
george
morris
fay
well,
i
feel
that
the
counsel
for
respondent
did
point
out
to
the
court
the
difference
between
the
consequences
of
the
use
of
the
word
witness
in
its
normal
accepted
things
which
excludes
a
party
in
the
sense
that
he
is
going
to
be
the
object
of
an
action
of
the
same
antagonist
that's
bringing
the
action
against
him
in
the
subpoena
form.
mr.
george
morris
fay
well,
i
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
i
said
only
in
the
subpoena
form,
your
honor.
i
was
using
the
term
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
action
in
the
sense
that
they
were
directing
the
subpoena
to
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
petitioner's
concept
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
of
the
word
used.
mr.
george
morris
fay
well
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
don't
think
that
that
thought
which
your
honor
expresses
is
spelled
out
any
place
in
its
eye.
but
from
the
standpoint
of
construction,
petitioner
certainly
contend
that
the
word
witnesses
would
mean
someone
who
is
capable
of
having
knowledge
of
an
act
that
is
to
be
used
against
another
party,
not
the
sense
that
it
is
a
party
to
the
act.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it
can
--
it
is
capable
of
being
used
in
both
senses.

prior
to
the
act
of
1952,
that
was
the
extent
of
the
subpoena
power
with
a
little
different
change
in
wording.
mr.
george
morris
fay
but
congress
added
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
under
the
first
part
of
the
section
235,
the
--
the
inspection
other
than
the
physical
and
mental
examination
of
aliens,

be
conducted
by

--
provided
in

inquiry.
mr.
george
morris
fay
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
george
morris
fay
we
contend
they
are
not,
sir.
and
that
the
only
place
for
such
authority
is
in
the
third
part
of
the
act,
that
congress
segregated
it
into
two
or
three
parts.
the
second
part
dealing
with
entry
and
exclusions,
the
third
part
of
the
act
which
contains
section
340
(a)
dealing
with
naturalized
citizens
or
other
citizens
who
might
be
suspected
of
being
aliens.
but
we
contend
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
second
part
of
this
act
and
certainly
not
in
section
235
(a)
that
gives
them
the
right
to
subpoena
the
citizen
in
court.
mr.
george
morris
fay
how
was
that
sir?
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
our
contention,
sir,
yes.
mr.
george
morris
fay
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
george
morris
fay
the
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
the
immigration
service
is
supposed
to
present
to
him
sufficient
evidence
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
to
show
cause.
mr.
george
morris
fay
it
well
maybe,
your
honor,
but
the
petitioner's
contention
is
that
the
evidence
should
not
be
obtained
by
the
subpoena
to
the
party
against
whom
the
evidence
is
going
to
be
used.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i'm
not
even
confident,
your
honor,
that
the
language
is
broad
enough
to
sustain
that
proposition.
and
that
the
--
any
investigation
with
relation
--
as
far
as
the
subpoena
power
is
concerned
now
only.
mr.
george
morris
fay
in
other
words,
it's
our
contention
that
the
service
has
the
right
to
investigate
and
to
secure
evidence
the
same
as
other
investigative
forces
do
without
subpoena
power
and
submit
that
to
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
george
morris
fay
all
right,
sir,
yes.
mr.
george
morris
fay
it's
capable
of
the
interpretation,
your
honor.
mr.
george
morris
fay
specifically?
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
specific
language.
i
merely
suggested
it
was
capable
of
the
interpretation.
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
black,
yes.
mr.
george
morris
fay
those
are
the
instructions
listed
by
the
attorney
general,
sir.
mr.
george
morris
fay
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
george
morris
fay
no,
your
honor,
this
is
a
code
of
regulations
as
mr.
justice
clark
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
morris
fay
he
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
no
sir.
no,
287.4
related
to
the
subpoena
power
and
who
may
issue.
it
is
the
regulation
promulgated
by
the
attorney
general
and
submitted
then.
but
even
at
that
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
2
--
28
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
george
morris
fay
as
applied
to
the
citizen,
yes,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
language
in
287.4
that
makes
a
reference
to
the
citizens,
sir.
it
requires
primarily
to
the
alien
and
the
word
issues
throughout
alien,
and
as
used.
and
it
has
reference
to
part
two
of
the
act
which
again
deals
with
entry
and
exclusion
and
not
with
naturalized
citizens.
mr.
george
morris
fay
under
the
second
part
of
the
act
until
it
--
we
proceed
in
the
--
the
court
under
the
third
part
of
the
act.
mr.
george
morris
fay
but
petitioner
maintains
that
that
is
in
proceeding
relative
to
entry
or
exclusion
in
the
dealing
he
gave
them.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
language
that
could
be
so
construed,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
george
morris
fay
well,
they'
all
require
to
have
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
before
filing
a
suit.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
morris
fay
there
is
under
the
interpretation
that
the
government
is
asking
for.
it
certainly
has
like
a
relationship
to
it
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
--
i
believe
the
--
the
consequences
that
flow
from
this
power,
if
it
is
once
conceded
to
exist
by
this
court,
such
as
the
government
contends,
is
best
illustrated
by
the
facts
in
this
case.
here,
these
petitioners
had
three
appearances
before
an
immigration
officer.
there
was
no
notice
in
the
subpoena
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
investigation.
they
asked
for
the
notice
that
are
--
they
asked
for
the
purpose
of
itt
mr.
george
morris
fay
no
sir,
not
three
subpoenas,
three
appearances,
i
say,
mr.
justice
reed.
mr.
george
morris
fay
the
first
two
were
in
compliance
with
an
oral
request,
a
written
letter
and
finally
the
subpoena.
but
they
asked
for
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
and
we're
refused
any
explanation
which
leads
petitioner
to
believe
that
even
on
the
face
of
the
subpoena,
it
might
be
subject
to
the
possible
construction
that
they
were
without
jurisdiction
and
that
they
were
relying
on
the
broader
language
for
denaturalization
or
revocation
which
is
incorporated
in
the
act
of
1952,
but
was
not
in
the
law
at
the
time
these
petitioners
received
their
naturalization
certificate.
congress
did
broaden
the
field
upon
which
you
could
denaturalize
a
person
in
this
act
of
1952.
when
they
said
it
no
longer
has
to
be
for
fraud,
it
can
merely
be
for
a
material
concealment
or
a
willful
misrepresentation
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
not
even
of
a
material
mind.
mr.
george
morris
fay
there
is
no
word
in
the
statute
that
i
can
say
that
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
our
concept,
your
honor.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
can't
conceive
of
it,
your
honor,
no.
finally,
all
of
these
undesirable
consequences
can
be
eliminated
if
the
construction
is
placed
on
this
235
(a)
by
this
court.
that
if
--
to
follow
that,
of
judge
foley,
that
it
was
never
conceived
by
congress
that
it
should
be
used
against
the
citizen
and
restrict
the
sole
method
of
procedure
to
340
(a)
under
part
three.
in
addition,
the
cases
which
the
government
cites
that
petitioner
contends
are
not
authority
for
the
invasion
of
privacy
that
would
result
from
the
issuance
of
this
subpoena
here.
their
cases
involve
primarily
economic
activities.
they're
directed
against
corporate
entities,
usually
records
of
the
object
of
the
subpoena.
witnesses
are
usually
officers
or
sole
proprietors
of
business
who
are
coming
in
to
testify
about
the
activities
of
their
business
which
the
petitioner
concedes
that
the
administrative
agencies
can
regulate.
finally,
in
some
other
cases,
the
witness
is
an
alien
rather
than
a
citizen.
and
the
petitioner
can
--
is
convinced
that
there
is
a
substantial
difference
between
the
two
with
rare
exception
of
every
one
of
the
statutes,
as
outlined
in
shapiro
v.
united
states
that
contained
this
subpoena
power,
also
contain
an
immunity
clause
and
it's
significant
here
that
congress
didn't
immunize
the
citizen
against
any
testimony
he
might
give
under
compulsion.
contracts
then,
the
corporate
entity
with
the
individual,
the
regulatory
problem
against
the
prosecution
of
the
individual
in
trying
to
take
a
certificate
away
from
him.
the
current
activities
to
the
remote
past
event
here
of
one
item
of
alleged
misstatement
of
fact
or
a
concealment.
and
finally,
the
production
of
records
against
that
vital
difference
of
oral
testimony.
it
seems
to
petitioner
that
congress
would
have
spoken
pretty
emphatically
and
unclearly
if
it
had
any
knowledge
that
the
immigration
service
had
an
intention
that
section
235
(a)
or
the
new
language
that
was
to
be
added
to
that
old
section
that
now
becomes
235
(a)
was
to
be
used
against
the
naturalized
citizens.
mr.
george
morris
fay
i
think
inherently
the
immigration
service
has
the
right.
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
morris
fay
or
anybody.
mr.
george
morris
fay
or
indeed
anybody
but
certainly,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
not
against
the
subject
who
is
going
to
be
--
in
effect
the
defendant
in
a
proceeding
shortly
thereafter.
mr.
george
morris
fay
yes.
mr.
george
morris
fay
yes.
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
morris
fay
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
american
--
mr.
george
morris
fay
--
of
--
of
the
american
way
of
life.
and
i
think
it's
best
exemplified
by
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
hughes'
opinion
in
the
macintosh
case
there
where
he
concluded
that
if
there
are
two
possible
interpretations
that
can
be
given
to
the
act,
the
one
most
hospitable
to
the
citizen
should
be
the
one
that
we
would
see.
