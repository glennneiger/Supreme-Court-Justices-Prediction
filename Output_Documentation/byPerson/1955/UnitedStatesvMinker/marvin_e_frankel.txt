mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
on
certiorari
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
falcone
case,
which
follows,
presents
the
same
problem.
the
question
in
both
cases
is
whether
under
section
235
(a)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952,
the
attorney
general
and
immigration
officers
have
power
to
subpoena
a
person
in
an
administrative
investigation
to
determine
whether
judicial
proceedings
should
be
brought
to
seek
revocation
of
that
persons'
naturalization
on
a
ground
that
it
was
unlawfully
procured.
section
235
(a),
which
gives
rise
to
the
problem,
appears
in
the
government's
brief,
beginning
at
page
51.
the
particular
sentence,
on
which
the
controversy
turns,
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
52.
some
six
lines
from
the
bottom
of
the
page
reads
as
follows,
“thus,
the
attorney
general
and
any
immigration
officer,
including
special
inquiry
officers,
shall
have
power
to
require
by
subpoena
the
attendants
and
testimony
of
witnesses
before
immigration
officers
and
special
inquiry
officers,
and
the
production
of
books,
papers
and
documents
relating
to
the
privilege
of
any
person
to
enter,
reenter,
reside
in,
or
pass
through
the
united
states,
or
concerning
any
matter
which
is
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
and
the
administration
of
this
service.”
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
focusing
on
the
particular
words
that
are
in
dispute,
we
have
used
asterisks
and
set
out
the
pertinent
coercion
of
the
statute
as
we
read
it.
the
facts
are
not
disputed
and
may
be
simply
stated.
in
september
1953,
the
respondent,
minker,
was
subpoenaed
under
section
235
(a),
and
directed
to
appear
before
an
immigration
officer.
before
the
date
directed
for
his
appearance,
he
moved
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
to
quash
the
subpoena.
the
motion
to
quash
was
denied
in
an
opinion
by
judge
welch
that
begins
at
page
13
of
the
record,
and
the
primary
issue
there
as
it
was
below
and
as
it
is
here,
and
as
it
is
in
the
falcone
case
which
follows
was
whether
section
235
(a)
authorized
the
subpoena
of
this
kind
for
this
kind
of
investigation.
following
the
denial
and
the
motion
to
quash,
a
letter
was
addressed
to
minker,
directing
his
appearance
in
accordance
with
the
subpoena.
when
he
failed
to
appear,
an
order
was
sought
in
the
district
court
in
accordance
with
section
235
(a)
to
require
to
compel
his
obedience.
the
order
was
issued
and
minker
again,
failed
to
appear,
disobeying
the
district
court's
order.
on
motion
of
the
government,
he
was
held
in
contempt
by
the
district
court
and
fined
$500.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
that
judgment
of
contempt
was
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
government
that
section
235
(a)
authorizes
the
use
of
subpoenas
in
investigations
of
the
type
involved
here
that
is
in
investigations
to
determine
whether
a
naturalization
certificate
has
been
fraudulently
procured
and
whether
proceedings
in
court
for
its
revocation
should
be
instituted.
the
court
held,
however,
that
the
word
“witnesses”
in
section
235
(a)
does
not
include
in
an
investigation
of
this
type,
the
persons
whose
certificate
of
naturalization
is
being
investigated.
and
on
this
ground
held
that
there
was
no
power
to
subpoena
minker,
and
as
i
say,
reversed
the
judgment.
as
i
pointed
out
in
summarizing
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
problem
here
can
be
broken
down
into
two
parts.
first,
the
question
whether
in
investigations
of
the
type
in
these
cases
of
the
subpoena
power
in
section
235
(a)
may
be
used
at
all.
and
if
that
question
is
answered
affirmatively,
there
was
a
further
narrower
question
on
which
the
court
below
decided
the
case,
whether
the
person
whose
naturalization
is
under
inquiry
can
be
subpoenaed
under
that
--
under
section
235
(a).
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
the
--
there
are
two
cases,
your
honor.
the
first
question
is
not
in
controversy
in
this,
the
minker
case.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
kind
of
investigation
was
certainly
--
the
word
the
court
used
was
certainly
a
matter
as
to
which
section
235
(a)
applied,
that
is,
it
was
an
investigation
of
a
problem,
material
and
relevant
in
the
enforcement
of
the
act,
and
therefore,
came
within
that
language
of
section
235
(a).
and
what
i
would
like
to
do
since
these
are
two
half-hour
cases
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
correct
your
honor.
it
agreed
with
the
second
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit,
a
case
from
which
is
pending
before
the
court
on
petition
for
certiorari,
so
that
all
three
courts
of
appeals
have
unanimously
agreed
that
the
subpoena
power
in
section
235
(a)
is
available
for
denaturalization
investigations
of
this
type.
what
i
would
like
to
do
because
this
first
point
is
controverted,
though,
we
have
won
it
in
the
three
courts
is
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
by
our
opponent.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
first,
since
it's
a
broader
point
in
some
ways
that
--
and
perhaps
illogically
a
prior
point
to
state
just
summarily
our
position
on
it,
and
then
turn
to
the
second
question
on
which
we
have
our
quarrel
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
briefly,
we
think
the
three
courts
of
appeals
are
right
for
the
reasons
i've
already
sketched,
i
think.
we
think
that
the
language,
any
matter,
which
is
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act,
clearly
includes
the
matter
of
investigating
to
see
whether
the
powers
of
the
attorney
general
and
the
duties
of
the
attorney
general
with
respect
to
revocation
of
fraudulently
obtained
naturalization
certificates
should
be
exercised
and
asserted.
we
think,
moreover,
that
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
as
to
this,
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision
would
have
emanated.
this
broad
language,
any
matter,
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act,
was
deliberately
and
purposefully
added
when
section
16
of
the
1917
immigration
act
was
carried
over
into
section
235
(a)
of
the
1952
act.
therefore,
the
language
that
applied
pretty
plainly
only
the
questions
of
exclusion
and
deportation
at
the
instance
of
the
immigration
service,
this
broad
additional
language
was
added.
and
though
our
opponents
attempt
now
to
limit
the
subpoena
power
in
235
(a),
still
to
exclusion
and
deportation
of
aliens,
we
think
that
could
only
be
accomplished
by
assuming
and
we
think
this
is
an
unavailable
and
improper
assumption
that
congress
didn't
know
what
it
was
about
when
it
added
this
broad
plain
language.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no
your
honor,
the
three
--
the
only
three
courts
of
appeals
which
have
considered
it
are
the
third,
second
and
fifth,
and
they
have
all,
without
dissent,
agreed
with
us
on
this
broad
question.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
problem
throughout
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
belatedly
and
we
think
insubstantially,
there
are
suggestions
of
constitutional
problems
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
which
were
never
raised
below.
and
we
think
even
as
a
source
of
attempting
to
generate
construction
doubts,
this
kind
of
tardy
act
for
--
to
raise
constitutional
problem
should
be
rejected.
now,
turning
to
the
narrow
question
on
which
the
third
circuit
decided
this
case
against
the
government,
the
court
and
its
analysis
of
this
problem
begins
on
page
18
of
the
record
and
--
and
i
plan
to
pitch
my
argument
to
some
extent
on
a
criticism
of
--
of
this
analysis.
the
court
of
appeals
began
with
a
proposition
that
the
word
“witnesses”
is
an
ambiguous
word.
it
said
that
there
are
many
occasions
where
it
is
difficult
to
know
whether
the
word
“witnesses”
includes
a
party.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
--
this
is
the
third
circuit
case
and
--
and
the
opinion
--
i
refer
to
page
18
of
this
slim
minker
record
where
the
opinion
begins
with
this
statement
to
the
problem.
in
this
connection,
the
court
refers
to
three
state
cases,
dealing
with
state
discovery
statutes
where
the
problem
of
what
the
word
“witnesses”
includes
was
considered,
and
where
i
think
in
each
instance,
the
state
court
held
that
it's
particular
discovery
statute
when
it
was
referred
to
witnesses
did
not
refer
to
a
party.
now,
we
think
that
the
error
of
the
third
circuit
begins
right
here.
i
think
it's
significant
that
although
it
mentioned
these
state
cases,
unlike
the
second
circuit
and
unlike
the
district
judge
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
reference
whatsoever
to
any
of
the
many
statutes
and
cases
dealing
with
the
administrative
subpoenaed
power,
which
is
what
concerns
us
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
was
summoned
to
appear
before
an
immigration
officer.
this
is
an
investigative
inquiry.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there,
the
summons
was
only
to
him.
he
didn't
come.
in
the
falcone
case,
the
two
falcone's
did
come
and
they
came
with
their
lawyers.
the
immigration
service
for
its
purposes,
did
not
invite
guests
in
the
subpoena,
but
there's
no
indication
that
others
than
the
--
than
minker
would
be
excluded.
it's
simply
a
subpoena
to
him
as
his
customary
directing
his
appearance.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
the
court
please,
i
had
turned
to
the
question
on
which
the
third
circuit
decided
this
case
against
the
government.
the
holding
that
when
the
--
when
section
235
(a)
gave
power
to
subpoena
witnesses,
it
did
not
include
power
to
subpoena
a
party
who
is
under
investigation
and
who
might
be
a
party
to
some
subsequent
judicial
or
administrative
adjudication.
at
page
41
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote,
we've
collected
a
list,
by
no
means,
complete,
of
federal
statutory
provisions
granting
administrative
subpoena
power.
in
all
of
this
and
in
others,
the
statute
provides
power
to
subpoena
witnesses.
and
that
word,
“witnesses”
in
this
context,
whatever
else
it
includes
or
excludes
has
always
been
understood
to
include,
perhaps
above
all
a
person
or
a
corporation,
which
was
himself
or
itself
under
investigation,
the
person
who
in
the
language
of
the
morton
salt
case
is
in
the
best
position
to
give
information
and
may
be
least
willing
to
do
so.
in
this
context,
unlike
the
context
of
the
discovery
statutes
the
court
below
referred
to,
we
think
the
word
“witnesses”
is
perfectly
clear.
whoever
it
includes,
it
certainly
includes
a
party
who
is
himself
being
investigated.
in
fact,
the
decision
below,
in
a
way,
gives
a
reverse
twist
to
the
problem
as
it
has
usually
be
--
been
presented
in
this
administrative
subpoena
cases.
as
the
court
knows,
in
cases
like
oklahoma
press
publishing
company
against
walling
and
others,
the
question
is
frequently
been
raised
by
a
party
subpoenaed
whether
he
could
be
subpoenaed.
and
the
argument
has
frequently
been
made
that
he
was
not
covered
by
the
act,
not
within
the
area
of
the
administrative
agencies
concerned
that
there
was
no
probable
cause,
no
coverage.
those
cases
have
all
assumed
at
the
very
least
that
if
the
person
wants
himself
a
proper
subject
of
investigation,
then
he
certainly
could
be
subpoenaed
and
there
is
no
need
here,
of
course,
to
go
into
the
extent
of
the
inquiry
into
coverage
just
as
it's
been
presented
in
those
cases.
i
mentioned
them
only
because
they
show
vividly
what
we
think
is
the
clear
error
of
the
court
below
in
its
construction
of
the
word
“witnesses”
in
this
kind
of
context.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
in
this
case,
as
in
practically
all
the
federal
statutes,
the
administrative
agency
has
no
power
of
compulsion.
it
is
authorized
to
go
to
a
district
court
as
the
immigration
service
did
in
this
case
to
seek
an
order
compelling
obedience
to
the
subpoena
and
the
sanction
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
order
is
simply
an
order
of
the
court
directing,
commanding
obedience
to
the
subpoena.
and
it
is
in
this
particular
case,
the
disobedience
of
that
district
court
order
that
led
to
the
judgment
of
content.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
has
their
--
whether
it
be
described
as
discretion
or
something
else.
there,
it
is
not
an
automatic
rubber
stamp
operation
as
the
decisions
go.
a
party
may
contend
that
a
subpoena
is
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
pardon?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
that
--
the
--
the
provision
for
district
court
enforcement
is
a
continuation
of
section
235
(a)
and
it
--
it
appears
on
page
53
of
our
brief.
at
the
end
of
the
sentence,
which
i
read
only
incompletely,
providing
for
the
subpoena
power
it
says,
“into
that
end,
the
attorney
general
and
the
immigration
officers
may
invoke
the
aid
of
any
court
of
the
united
states.”
and
then,
it
goes
on,
“and
to
provide
for
an
order
by
the
district
court,
compelling
obedience
to
the
subpoena
with
the
sanction
for
disobedience
of
that
order
a
possible
judgment
of
content.”
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
court
can
refuse
it
and
of
course
there
are
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
refuse
to
grant
the
court
order
of
compulsion,
that's
right,
your
honor.
a
party
may
come
into
court
and
assert
that
a
subpoena
is
oppressive
or
unfair
or
that
it
seeks
information
that
is
not
within
the
competence
of
the
agency
to
demand
or
request
as
our
friend
on
the
other
side
points
out,
if
the
immigration
service
sort
to
ask
a
question
about
some
subject
wholly
outside
its
field
about
a
person's
tax
returns
unless
it
could
show
some
relevance
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act,
that
might
be
a
proper
basis
for
opposing
a
subpoena,
or
in
any
particular
case,
the
claims
have
privilege
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
in
--
in
this
case,
as
in
the
falcone
case,
the
subpoena
itself
does
not
state
the
subject
matter.
here,
on
the
argument,
on
the
motions
to
quash
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
made
clear.
in
falcone,
in
the
order
to
show
cause
why
there
should
not
be
an
order
of
compulsion
by
the
district
court.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
pardon?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
in
this
case,
a
motion
by
minker,
to
quash
the
subpoenas.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
which
had
been
issued
by
the
immigration
service
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
preceeded
the
later
order,
compelling
him
to
appear.
the
chronology
is
this,
the
subpoena
was
issued
before
the
return
day,
he
moved
to
quash
the
subpoena,
he
moved
in
the
district
court
to
quash
the
subpoena.
his
motion
was
denied.
he
nevertheless
failed
to
respond
to
the
subpoena.
then,
the
service,
the
immigration
service,
through
the
united
states
attorney
went
to
the
district
court
for
an
order
of
compulsion,
and
the
only
serious
issue
that
have
been
presented
on
the
motion
to
quash,
that
is
the
power
to
issue
a
subpoena
of
this
kind
under
235
(a),
that
issue
having
been
resolved
on
the
hearing
and
in
the
opinion
on
the
motion
to
quash
and
order
of
compulsion
followed.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
all
the
proceedings
in
this
case
occurred
in
the
same
district
court
before
the
same
district
judge.
although,
i
take
it
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
in
every
case.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
correct,
your
honor,
just
like
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
his
motion
to
quash
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
might
pay
attention
to
it
because
he
wanted
at
the
earliest
opportunity
to
establish
his
claim
that
there
was
no
power
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
don't
think
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
his
bringing
on
that
motion
presents
any
special
problem
to
the
court
now,
because
following
the
denial
of
the
motion,
he
still
refused
to
obey
and
then
we
have
an
order
of
the
district
court
compelling
obedience
and
the
judgment
of
content
which
is
the
judgment
from
which
the
appeal
was
taken.
so,
i
suppose
that
whether
we
assume
the
motion
to
quash
was
ill-advised,
or
premature
or
not,
makes
no
difference
at
this
point.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
we
think
not,
your
honor.
and
in
great
many
of
these
provisions
we
cite,
relating
to
administrative,
investigative
subpoena
power
which
is
what
concerns
us
here.
the
acts
to
which
they
relay,
contained
provisions
for
proceedings
of
one
kind
to
another
in
court,
civil
or
criminal.
now,
it's
always
been
clear
that
there
was
no
inconsistency
between
those
provisions
for
court
proceedings
and
the
authority
to
use
an
administrative
subpoena
for
investigative
purposes.
the
investigative
subpoena
is
used
and
to
bring
it
to
this
context,
it's
used
to
determine
whether
there
is
the
good
cause
that
or
to
exist
before
a
--
an
action
is
brought
to
denaturalize
the
person,
whether
it
--
whether
the
good
cause
exist
in
terms
of
the
affidavit
or
in
terms
of
knowledge
of
the
u.s.
attorney
in
this
problem
and
another
case
pending
that
--
that
i
won't
go
into.
but
the
agency
in
every
case,
whether
it's
under
the
federal
trade
commission
or
whether
it's
the
scc
that's
simply
determining
whether
somebody
has
solved
securities
fraudulently
or
whether
it's
the
veterans
administrator
determining
whether
a
school
under
the
gi
bill
has
committed
a
fraud
or
an
alleged
veteran
has
fraudulently
obtained
rights
or
claims.in
every
one
of
these
cases,
the
agency
may
be
and
frequently
is
seeking
to
determine
whether
it
ought
to
go
to
court
to
prosecute
this
person,
either
civilly
or
criminally.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
dates
from
that
at
least,
yes
your
honor.
you
have
--
and
--
and
many
decisions,
i
might
say,
make
this
distinction
between
the
power
of
administrative
investigation
which
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
compared
to
a
grand
jury's
proceedings
or
a
pretrial
discovery
between
that
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
judicial
proceedings
on
the
other
hand
that
the
investigating
agency
may
be
authorized
or
under
a
duty
to
bring
inappropriate
circumstances.
so,
we
think
the
court
below
was
wrong
when
it
said
that
there
was
a
conflict
or
an
inconsistency
between
the
creation
on
the
one
hand
of
a
judicial
proceeding
for
revocation
of
fraudulent
certificates
of
naturalization.
and
our
claim
on
the
other
hand
that
the
immigration
service
could
use
the
subpoena
power
in
its
investigation
to
determine
whether
such
a
case
ought
to
be
brought.
that
--
that
is
a
familiar
pattern
of
administrative
investigation
followed
by
appropriate
judicial
proceedings.
and
as
--
as
i
say,
the
statutes,
which
have
conferred
the
subpoena
power,
refer
repeatedly
in
all
of
these
instances
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
others
simply
to
witnesses,
and
that
in
every
case
includes
at
least
the
person
who
is
under
investigation.
now,
this
does
not
mean
that
either
at
the
administrative
stage
or
at
the
judicial
stage,
any
of
the
protections
of
a
person
are
denied.
the
fifth
circuit,
which
like
the
second
circuit,
has
agreed
with
us
on
this
problem,
has
had
occasion
recently
to
uphold,
for
example,
a
claim
of
privilege
by
a
person
subpoenaed
in
an
investigation
of
this
kind.
and
where
a
claim
of
privilege
is
appropriate,
we
assume
that
it
will
be
asserted
and
vindicated
in
the
courts
which
are
the
only
agencies
that
have
any
power
of
compulsion
of
--
in
this
area.
so,
in
short,
agreeing
with
the
court
below
and
the
other
two
circuits
that
investigations
of
this
type
are
covered
by
235
(a).
what
we
assert
in
this
case
is
that
the
narrow
basis
of
decision
of
the
court
below
is
incorrect
and
that
the
naturalized
citizen
whose
certificate
is
being
inquired
into
may
be
subpoenaed
in
such
an
investigation.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
they
don't
have
generally
a
subpoena
power,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
there
is
no
--
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
by
a
subpoena.
and
of
course,
there,
you
run
into
problems
of
self
incrimination
which
in
a
criminal
context
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes
--
not
well,
in
--
in
the
criminal
context,
the
--
the
privilege
may
well
be
a
privilege
not
to
be
subjected
to
inquiry
at
all.
here,
in
a
--
in
an
appropriate
case,
a
person
may
say
that
question
that
you're
undertaking
to
ask
me
is
improper
and
i
plead
my
privilege
to
it,
and
that
kind
of
claim
may
be
upheld.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
appears
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
ordinally
before
an
immigration
officer.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
these
are
subordinate
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
statute
does
not
in
terms
provide
for
such
notice,
and
i
might
say
that
this
is
equally
true
of
all
the
other
statutes
we
cite
which
simply
say,
usually
in
very
broad
language,
“for
the
purposes
of
this
act
or
for
any
purposes
which
the
administrator
deems
material
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act,
subpoenas
maybe
issued.”
now,
in
an
appropriate
case,
i
think
a
person
might
properly
demand
some
information
as
to
the
nature
of
the
investigation.
in
both
of
these
cases,
long
before
the
proceedings
began
to
win
their
way
up
through
the
courts,
these
people
knew.
and
usually,
it's
a
practical
matter
before
a
subpoena
is
issued,
there
have
been
interviews
and
people
do
know.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
because
i
think
our
opponents
implicitly
at
least
take
a
different
view
that
as
these
cases
have
come
up,
there
has
been
no
issue
presented
as
to
the
propriety
of
these
subpoenas
on
grounds
that
they
didn't
give
adequate
notice,
and
i
want
to
make
that
accurately.
there
was
in
the
motion
to
quash
an
assertion
that
there
was
not
adequate
notion
--
notice
of
the
nature
in
the
investigation
that
the
fact
was
secured,
and
when
minker
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
that
problem
dropped
out
of
the
case.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it
was
secured
by
the
--
the
immigration
service,
stating
the
purpose
of
the
investigation.
and
the
district
court
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
purpose
is
in
investigation
of
the
lawfulness
of
denaturalization
of
the
respondent,
minker.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
you
ask
is
that
a
fair
inference,
your
honor?
i'd
say
on
this
slim
record,
i
would
not
be
prepared
to
assert
that
you
should
draw
that
inference.
what
i
am
saying
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
oh,
yes.
by
the
time
--
you
see,
before
he
was
ever
ordered
to
obey
the
subpoena
that
is
on
his
motion
to
quash
at
the
earlier
or
at
the
latest.
he
knew
and
judge
welch
in
his
opinion
states
the
purpose
of
this
investigation
as
an
inquiry
into
petitioner's
naturalization
obtained
in
1945.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that
--
that
is
unquestionably.
no,
i
--
i
would
put
it
differently,
your
honor,
i
think.
i
would
say
that
this
is
an
inquiry
to
determine
whether
there
are
possible
grounds
for
a
revocation
proceeding.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there
are
many
such
inquiries
and
relatively
few.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that
is
the
possibility,
which
faces
us,
yes
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
at
a
time
when
it's
under
investigation
by
the
grant
jury,
i
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
say
that
it
is,
and
of
course
this
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
may
i
answer
him,
mr.
chief?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
in
--
first,
i
want
to
start
generally
with
the
so-called
regulatory
situations
and
then
i
want
to
come
closer
to
home
with
this
denaturalization
situation
and
the
functions
of
the
immigration
service.
in
all
of
the
statutes,
generally,
the
subpoena
power
exists
for
the
purposes
of
this
act
and
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
of
the
particular
act
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
which
is
commonly
an
act
including
criminal,
as
well
as
civil
fractions.
as
the
court
knows
and
among
the
places,
it
has
been
pointed,
it's
in
mr.
justice
cardozo's
dissent
in
jones
against
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
but
i
think
it's
a
familiar
learning
that
these
investigations
frequently
do
lead
to
criminal
prosecution.
the
fact
that
they
may
disclose
or
may
lead
to
demands
or
requests
for
information,
having
a
possible
basis
in
the
criminal
prosecution
is
reflected
i
think
in
--
in
the
common
appearance
in
this
statutes
of
compulsory
testimony,
immunity
provisions,
and
in
the
cases
where
absence
of
such
a
provision
claims
that
privilege
have
been
asserted.
and
the
fact
is
that
whether
it's
in
the
internal
revenue
service
or
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
or
into
the
securities
and
exchange
act,
administrative
inquiries
have
served
not
infrequently
as
basis
for
criminal
prosecution.
and
you
look
at
the
cases
on
their
face
as
somebody
violating
the
record
keeping
requirements,
or
the
minimum
wage
requirements.
the
answer
to
that
question
and
it
is
commonly
to
somebody
who
is
charged,
who
is
called
in
on
subpoena.
the
answer
to
that
question
may
be
a
material
fact
in
a
criminal
prosecution,
and
it
turns
out
to
be
the
case,
not
infrequently.
in
this
area,
as
the
court
below
itself
has
held,
subpoenas
to
potential
deportees
have
been
used
for
a
long
time,
and
have
been
upheld,
and
we
are
in
an
area
that
this
kind
of
sui
generis
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
compare
closely
denaturalization
with
deportation.
both
are
serious
matters.
now,
in
deportation,
the
subpoenas
have
been
used
in
just
as
where
to
inquire
into
grounds
for
possible
deportation,
and
such
a
defender
over
the
right
of
privacy
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
held
for
a
unanimous
court
that
answers
to
such
question
should
be
compelled,
that's
bilokumsky
against
tod.
and
so,
when
congress
provided
this
subpoena
power
for
any
matter,
material
and
relevant
in
the
enforcement
of
this
act,
when
you
look
at
this
act,
we
think
you
realize
that
it
does
concern
grave
matters.
and
there
is
a
history
of
subpoenaing
the
person
who
is
potentially
liable
to
suffer
from
these
serious
sanctions.
and
so,
we
say
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
gravity
of
this
for
construing
the
word
“witnesses”
differently
from
the
way
it's
been
construed
in
a
precisely
pertinent
context
for
70
years.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
that's
conceded,
your
honor.
at
least
our
opponent
in
falcone
conceives
that
we
could
get
pretrial
discovery,
which
is
a
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
it's
hard
to
say
whether
the
government
would
suffer
or
naturalized
citizens
would
suffer.
when
the
--
pardon
me
--
when
the
power
of
administrative
investigation
is
given,
it
is
given
not
simply
to
bring
lawsuits
but
to
see
where
the
lawsuits
should
be
brought.
in
a
great
majority
of
the
cases,
they
are
not
brought.
now,
i
think
it's
true
that
the
argument
against
us
is
calculated
to
make
it
necessary
or
desirable
that
we
bring
more
lawsuits
and
accomplish
through
the
pretrial
discovery
with
the
subpoena
issued
by
a
district
court
clerk
rather
than
a
district
director
of
the
immigration
service,
exactly
at
the
same
end,
but
as
we
note
in
our
brief
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
the
procedure
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
the
procedure
would
be
substantially
identical,
your
honor,
substantially
identical.
the
interrogation
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
their
positions
are
not
taken
in
a
court
room,
neither
is
this
inquiry
made
in
the
court
room,
but
as
these
cases
reflect
and
as
lansky
and
savoretti
which
i
referred
to
shows
in
a
holding
the
deponent
just
as
in
a
pretrial
discovery,
goes
to
the
court
everytime
he
thinks
something
is
being
attempted
that
he
ought
to
resist.
and
that,
as
we
see
it,
is
--
is
not
materially
different
in
the
administrative
investigation
from
what
it
is
in
the
pretrial
discovery
situation.
in
both
cases,
it
takes
place
in
somebody's
office.
i
think
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
the
government
would
suffer
an
injury
in
the
sense
that
the
public
suffers
an
injury,
one,
where
unnecessary
lawsuits
are
insisted
upon.
i
think
the
same
thing
might
be
set
at
the
administrative
investigatory
power
under
any
of
these
statutes.
you
might
say,
”why
should
we
enforce
this
as
it
was
written?”
you
can
do
the
same
thing
in
pretrial
discovery.
our
argument
is
that
the
power
was
given
with
respect
to
any
matter,
material
and
relevant
in
the
enforcement
of
this
act
that
the
power
of
administrative
inquiry
is
a
sanitary
power,
but
the
government's
fact
to
gathering
processes
are
necessary
and
important
in
the
proper
administration
of
the
act,
and
that
this
plain
terms
so
it
not
to
be
paired
away
on
a
ground
that
some
other
procedure,
other
than
the
one
we
think
congress
clearly
authorized
might
throw
more
expense
and
more
trouble
to
the
government
and
the
parties
ultimately
accomplish
the
same
end.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
in
these
cases
even
--
even
when
they're
brought
in
court.
unfortunately,
we
don't
win
every
single
one
of
them.
now,
these
investigations
under
the
attorney
general's
regulations
are
not
to
be
started
unless
there
is
a
prima
facie
showing
a
ground
for
revocation.
so,
we
will
assume,
as
we
should,
that
in
using
the
subpoena
power,
the
officers
will
behave
properly.
they
won't,
at
random,
drag
in
the
seven
or
eight
or
ten
million
naturalized
citizens.
then,
if
--
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
naturalized
citizen
is
asked
questions,
in
the
ordinary
case,
he
answers
where
he
want
subpoena
may
be
used.
now,
supposed
he
either
refuses
to
answer
questions
or
refuses
to
obey
a
subpoena,
under
bilokumsky
against
tod,
which
reflects
common
experience
in
declaring
that
silence
may
be
a
very
significant
evidence,
taking
the
alien
--
the
naturalized
citizen's
refusal
to
clear
up
these
problems,
together
with
the
prima
facie
grounds,
the
immigration
officer
is
supposed
to
have
had
to
start
the
investigation.
i
think
in
the
normal
case,
we
would
certainly
have
enough
to
warrant
bringing
the
suit
under
340
(a)
even
assuming,
which
is
not
settled
by
this
court,
that
a
good
cause
affidavit
is
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
such
a
suit.
and
there,
we
would
be
with
a
pretrial
discovery,
no
more
protection
than
the
person
investigated
as
of
now,
no
less
or
more
compulsion
than
he
has
now.
but
only
as
we
see
it,
one,
a
deviation
from
the
perfectly
authorized
procedure
congress
gave
the
attorney
general.
and
two,
a
consequence
in
increased
lawsuits
that
effective
administrative
investigation
can
avoid
as
it
has
avoided
them
in
so
many
cases
mentioned
in
our
brief.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
but
if
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
say
he
learned
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
learned
not
later
than
that.
you
see,
your
honor,
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
whether
this
subpoena
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he's
ordered
to
appear?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well
it's
--
you
could
call
it
that,
it's
the
order
enforcing
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
it's
--
it
refers
to
the
administrative
proceedings
captioned
in
re
abraham
minker
--
minker
in
which
he
is
to
appear,
the
opinion
beginning
on
page
13,
and
i
refer
specifically
at
page
14.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
you
look
at
the
last
three
lines
of
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
now,
the
opinion
rendered
earlier
than
this
order,
in
the
--
on
the
motion
to
quash
observes
and
there
is
no
factual
dispute
on
it,
on
this
that
those
proceedings
concerned
the
possibility
of
revoking
minker's
certificate
of
naturalization.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
opinion?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes
your
honor,
it
begins
on
page
13.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
order
denying
the
motion
to
quash?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes
your
honor.
the
motion
to
quash
is
on
page
12.
the
order
denying
the
motion
to
quash
is
on
page
16,
and
from
13
to
16
appears
the
opinion.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
because
i
think
it
would
be
a
misfortune
to
trivialize
this
case
at
this
point
that
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
a
person
can
properly
oppose
a
subpoena,
and
i
think
in
appropriate
cases,
he
can
because
he
hasn't
any
information
as
to
why
he's
being
called
in.
there's
no
issue
here
about
that.
in
this
case,
we
are
the
petitioner,
but
there
was
no
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
it
and
there's
no
issue
raised
in
minker's
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
say
assuming
--
assuming
this
is
a
legitimate
basis
for
opposing
a
subpoena.
it
is
not
open
in
this
court.
now,
on
the
remand,
if
such
issues
are
ought
to
be
raised,
although,
the
people
know
perfectly
well
the
subject
matter
of
the
inquiry,
they
may
be
considered
by
the
district
court.
but
we
don't
think
that
these
cases
in
one
of
which,
we've
petitioned
and
the
other
of
which
we
have
consented
to
certiorari,
where
this
important
general
issue
of
statutory
construction
is
--
is
presented
should
be
put
it
away
on
these
problems
that
never
were
raised
at
appropriate
stages
in
these
proceedings
or
have
been
abandoned
before
the
case
has
came
to
this
court.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
--
i
think
that
the
government's
pass
in
these
cases
is
to
meet
your
attack,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
we
think
it's
clear,
the
nature
of
this
inquiries
and
that
--
that
it
is
in
large
part
that
where
a
nature
that
poses
the
problems
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
address
myself
first
to
the
question
that's
been
discussed
at
some
length
in
both
mr.
kossman's
argument
and
mr.
fay's
argument.
the
answer
--
our
answer
to
which
i
would
put
this
way.
in
the
administrative
subpoena
power,
the
administrative
investigative
subpoena
power,
as
it
is
grown
up
over
the
long
years,
there
is
no
necessity
in
order
to
find
such
a
power
that
there'll
be
a
power
of
hearing
or
adjudication
on
the
subject
matter
to
which
the
power
relates.
that's
a
long
sentence
and
let
me
try
to
explicate
it.
the
administrator,
the
wage
--
the
administrator
has
clearly
a
subpoena
power,
the
power
that
was
before
this
court
in
oklahoma
press
publishing
company
against
walling.
he
uses
the
subpoena
power
as
the
court
knows
to
get
facts
to
determine
whether
he
will
bring
an
action
in
court.
he
has
no
power
himself,
although
it
has
been
urged
that
he
ought
to
have
to
adjudicate
the
subject
as
to
which
he
investigates
and
for
which
this
court
has
upheld
his
subpoena
power.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
it
depends,
your
honors.
of
some
of
these
investigations,
criminal
prosecutions
result.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
for
one
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
can
i
name
two
or
three
that
--
that
answers
that?
the
veterans
administrator.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
social
security
administrator.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
oh.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there
are
exceptions,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes
of
course,
your
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
sir,
you're
--
you're
wrong
about
some
of
them
and
--
and
that's
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
the
--
the
administrator
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
has
the
subpoena
power
with
respect
to
matters
as
to
which
he
does
not
have
adjudicating
power.
now,
let
me
say
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
this
one
further
thing.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
this
footnote
--
this
footnote,
your
honor,
was
not
written
for
this
purpose.
i
would
like
permission
to
go
beyond
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
this
footnote.
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
these
--
the
--
the
narrow
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
scope
of
the
subpoena
power
has
never,
to
my
knowledge,
been
measured
by
the
scope
of
the
adjudicating
power.
and
it
is
no
answer
to
our
argument,
as
i
see
it,
that
the
subpoena
power
is
available
for
the
purposes
we
assert
here
to
say
that
this
is
not
a
subject
on
which
the
attorney
general
can
adjudicate.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
unfortunately
i
--
i
didn't
copy
out
the
language
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
let
me
read
the
language
of
the
veterans
pension
act.
it
says,
"for
the
purposes
of
the
laws
administered
by
the
veterans
administration,
there
shall
be
a
power
to
subpoena
witnesses."
now,
it's
been
held
and
i
think
it
falls
squarely
within
that
language
that
schools,
taking
money
from
veterans
under
the
g.i.
bills
can
be
investigated
and
are
subject
to
that
subpoena
power
of
the
veterans
administrator
when
he's
inquiring,
whether
there
maybe
civil
or
criminal
fraud
in
their
use
of
government
money
through
the
g.i.
bill.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
the
way
--
the
way
these
matters
work
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
would
refer
them
to
the
attorney
general,
your
honor.
just
as
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
would
refer
criminal
prosecutions
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
command
of
this
act
is
that
the
attorney
general
is
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
all
the
provisions
of
this
act.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
--
that
means
the
attorney
general
and
with
appropriate
delegations
which
are
authorized
by
the
statute,
his
delegee.
now,
i
think
it
should
be
born
in
mind
that
235
(a),
the
provision
we're
discussing
here,
refers
to
the
attorney
general
and
any
immigration
officer.
it
gives
this
subpoena
power
in
terms,
unlike
the
old
1917
act
to
the
attorney
general
whose
powers
and
responsibilities
are
--
and
this,
i
think,
is
quite
undisputed,
coextensive
with
this
act
with
its
civil
and
criminal
provisions.
now,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
attorney
general.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well
the
attorney
general
has
broad
powers
of
delegation
under
the
act.
these
people
were
subpoenaed
by
a
district
director
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
in
section
103
(a),
your
honor.
i
believe
it's
103
(a)
18.
no,
it's
103
(a).
it
says
"the
attorney
general
shall
be
charged
with
the
administration
and
enforcement
of
this
act
and
all
other
laws
relating
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
of
alien".
then
down
below,
it
said
"he
is
authorized
to
appoint
employees
and
to
delegate
to
them
or
any
officer
or
employee
of
the
department
of
justice
in
his
discretion
any
of
the
duties
and
powers
imposed
upon
him
by
this
act."
there's
no
question
of
the
due
delegation
of
the
subpoena
power
in
the
regulations
that
were
discussed
by
mr.
fay
with
mr.
justice
clark.
and
there
is
no
question,
i
think,
that
for
purposes
of
the
statutory
construction
problem
before
the
court,
it's
the
same
as
if
this
subpoena
had
been
issued
by
the
attorney
general.
this
is
a
function
of
the
attorney
general
being
performed
with
no
question
as
to
the
propriety
and
the
delegation
by
his
duly
authorized
and
barely
high
ranking
subordinate.
now,
i
say
and
it's
hard
to
demonstrate
this
briefly
but
i
believe
it's
clear
that
the
administrative
investigative
power
as
it
has
for
years
and
coupled
with
the
subpoena
power,
has
never
been
restricted
to
the
areas
where
the
administrative
authority
can
make
an
adjudication.
now,
i
think
this
act,
section
235
(a),
appropriately
reflects
that
proposition
which
i
had
thought
was
clear.
after
conferring
the
subpoena
power
--
i'm
now
referring
to
page
53
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
minker
case,
the
case
preceding
this
one.
after
referring
or
granting
the
subpoena
power,
for
purposes
of
any
matter
which
is
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
and
the
administration
of
the
service.
the
act
goes
on
to
provide
an
enforcement
power
in
the
district
court.
and
the
next
sentence
says,
"any
united
states
district
court
within
the
jurisdiction
of
which
investigations
or
inquiries
are
being
conducted,"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
provide
for
their
enforcement
of
this
subpoena.
now
this,
i
submit,
is
part
of
a
familiar
pattern.
this
pattern
of
administrative
subpoena
for
investigative
purposes,
not
linked
to
or
limited
by
the
scope
of
the
adjudicating
power
that
the
agency
may
have
mr.
justice
cardozo
said,
the
investigations,
these
administrative
investigations,
armed
with
the
subpoena
power
are
quite
appropriate
even
where
their
objective
may
be
to
turn
up
material
for
criminal
prosecution.
and
it's
clear
that
the
agencies
that
have
this
subpoena
power
do
not
have
the
power
to
conduct
criminal
prosecutions.
and
so
here,
i
say
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
is
only
given
the
power
and
duty
to
enforce
the
revocation
provisions
in
court
is
no
reason
for
denying
his
subpoena
power
but
as
part
of
a
very
old
scheme,
is
appropriate
reason
to
grant
it
to
him
when
congress
had
spoken
as
we
think
so
clearly.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
and
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
now,
i
want
to
go
to
those
words
again
and
see
how
clear
they
are
in
the
light
of
the
time,
the
circumstances
and
the
personnel
who
wrote
it.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
we
may
--
we
may
wind
up
quarreling
about
the
phrase
--
the
word
specific
but
he
needs
statutory
authority
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
to
do
that,
we
concede.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
--
i
think
when
i
read
what
you
rather
quickly,
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
you
cannot
have
the
subpoena
power
without
statutory
authorization.
our
issue
here
is,
"do
we
have
the
statutory
authorization
for
the
kind
of
subpoena
power
we
have
asserted?"
now,
my
further
point
is
that
when
you're
construing
a
statute
like
this
which
grants
the
subpoena
power,
it
is
not
a
valid
argument
to
say
this
subpoena
power
doesn't
extend
to
subject
x
because
as
to
subject
x,
you
don't
have
any
adjudicating
power.
i
am
saying
that
congress,
over
and
over
again,
has
given
a
power
of
investigation
coupled
with
a
subpoena
power
relating
to
questions
as
to
which
the
particular
official
could
not
adjudicate
but
could
only
bring
an
action
in
court
if
his
investigation
turned
up
immaterial.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
the
stautute
contemplates
just
that.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
want
to
tell
you
two
things
very
quickly,
if
i
may.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
want
to
tell
you
first
that
the
attorney
general
has
the
duty
and
the
power
to
initiate
denaturalization
proceedings
in
the
court.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
then
i
want
to
say
that
this
subpoena
power
that
we're
concerned
with
here
is
the
attorney
general's
subpoena
power.
now,
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
doesn't
run
around
the
country
and
serve
subpoenas
or
even
sign
them,
has
never
been
a
material
issue
in
this
case.
it's
clear
under
the
act,
and
nobody
has
quarreled
with
us,
that
he
can
delegate
that
power.
in
8
cfr,
287.4,
which
was
discussed
with
mr.
justice
clark,
that
new
delegation
has
been
made.
so
what
we
say
is,
that
this
is
clearly
a
matter
material
and
relevant
in
the
enforcement
of
this
act
which
is
one,
the
kind
of
matter
for
which
the
attorney
general
is
responsible,
and
two,
the
kind
of
matter
as
to
which
he
has
been
given
the
subpoena
power
subject
to
appropriate
delegation.
now,
i
want
to
talk
about
this
language
and
try
to
make
our
point
that
it
clearly
covers
this
kind
of
subpoena.
the
language
says,
the
subpoena
may
be
used
concerning
any
matter
which
is
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right
and
i
--
if
--
if
our
skip
--
skip
has
been
too
slippery,
i
want
to
apologize,
we
didn't
intend
it
that
way.
but
we
do
intend
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
i
--
i
was
just
touched
by
the
description
of
our
asterisk
but
they
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
we've
never
thought
of
them
in
quite
that
powerful
way
and
--
and
i
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
what
i
want
to
say
about
this
language
is
this.
this
language
was
deliberately
and
purposefully
added
to
the
former
subpoena
provision.
when
mr.
kossman
says,
"it
would
be
fine
to
compare
this
language
with
other
general
subpoena
power
language
which
it
precisely
resembles,
he
largely,
we
think,
concedes
our
case
because
this
language
wasn't
just
an
old
thing
that
was
slipped
in
at
some
prior
time
but
the
attention
of
congress
was
focused
precisely
on
this
new
additional
broad
clause.
now,
what
did
the
congress
revoke
to
the
1952
act,
think
of
when
it
thought
of
matters
which
are
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act.
what's
our
evidence?
the
senate
committee
listed
six
broad,
overall
significant
achievements
of
the
1952
act.
one
of
them
was,
that
the
act
heightened
up
and
made
more
stringent
the
naturalization
and
denaturalization
provisions.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there's
only
one
--
well
there
are
a
lot
of
provisions.
but
when
i
--
what
i'm
saying
now
is
this.
this
is
plain
language.
denaturalization
is
in
plain
language
material
and
relevant.
now,
the
question
is,
"should
we
take
it
out
or
should
we
leave
it
in?"
and
we
say
that
when
this
congress
thought
of
what
was
material
and
relevant
in
the
enforcement
of
this
act,
when
it
thought
of
the
hardcore
of
essential
functions
of
the
immigration
service,
one
of
the
few
things
you
would
immediately
think
of
is
denaturalization.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
not
in
this
amendment.
no
instances
were
given.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
they
gave
an
example.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
they
gave
an
example.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
they
gave
an
example
that
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i'm
not
saying
this
was
a
preoccupation,
if
you
please.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
are
concerned
not
with
the
particular
example
that
the
immigration
and
natural
--
naturalization
service
gave,
although,
note,
that
it's
an
example,
it
doesn't
relate
to
an
alien
and
doesn't
relate
to
deportation
or
exclusion.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
10
minutes
remaining
in
this
case,
i
should
like
to
return
to
the
broad
point
with
which
the
argument
of
these
two
cases
started.
namely,
the
point
on
which
the
second,
third
and
fifth
circuits
have
all
unanimously
agreed
that
the
subpoena
power
under
section
235
(a)
extends
to
investigations
to
determine
whether
revocation
proceeding
should
be
brought.
now,
the
investigation
of
such
cases
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
in
the
minker
case
has
long
been
a
familiar
function
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
it
was
perfectly
familiar
to
the
congress
which
wrote
the
1952
act.
that
act
as
the
court
knows
resulted
from
a
three-year
study
of
immigration
and
nationality
and
naturalization
problems
and
their
administration.
and
the
functions
of
the
service
with
respect
to
this
problem
of
revocation
were
clear
to
all
as
they
have
been
clear
to
all
familiar
with
this
area
of
the
law
for
50
years.
the
common
commission,
the
president's
commission
on
the
immigration
and
naturalization
laws
in
this
volume
whom
shall
we
welcome
going
over
the
functions
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
on
page
127,
listed
the
central
functions
as
follows.
"a
--
the
service
is
concerned,"
the
commission
said,
"with
the
admission
or
exclusion
of
immigrants,
the
apprehension
and
removal
of
deportable
aliens,
the
conduct
of
naturalization
proceedings
and
the
preparation
of
denaturalization
cases.”
this,
as
i
say,
has
long
been
familiar
to
everyone
that
the
immigration
service
conducted
this
kind
of
investigative
activity
with
respect
to
possible
cases
of
revocation.
now,
it's
against
this
background,
we
suggest,
that
section
235
(a)
must
be
read.
section
235
(a)
extends
the
power
of
subpoena
for
purposes
of
administrative
investigation
to
any
matter
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
it
--
it
says,
"any
matter"
and
we
contend
generally
said,
"it
was
not
to
be
read
anymore
narrowly
than
it
--
than
it
reads."
it
ought
to
mean
"any
matter."
and
what
we
say
is
that
if
exceptions
ought
to
be
read
into
that
broad
language,
certainly,
in
exception
ought
not
to
cover
this
familiar
central
and
important
kind
of
function
of
the
immigration
service
which
had
long
been
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act.
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
--
if
it
is
fairly
a
matter
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
or
the
administration
of
the
service,
both
categories
are
stated
in
this
general
language.
the
subpoena
power
is
available
as
it
is
in
other
areas
of
administrative
law.
for
example,
in
this
footnote
on
page
41
of
our
minker
brief,
we
cite
38
u.s.c.131.
now,
that
says,
"for
the
purposes
of
the
laws
administered
by
the
veterans
administration,
the
administrator
of
veterans
affairs
shall
have
the
power
to
subpoena
witnesses.”
now
recently,
we
had
two
cases,
one
in
the
fifth
and
one
in
the
eighth
circuit
where
the
administrator
undertook
to
use
this
subpoena
power
in
connection
with
educational
and
training
statutes
of
congress
to
obtain
testimony
and
records
from
schools
at
which
veterans
were
taking
such
training.
both
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
upheld
the
use
of
the
subpoena
power
for
this
purpose.
this
was
for
the
purposes
of
one
of
the
laws
administered
by
the
veterans
administration
and
as
such,
it
came
within
this
broad
grant
of
the
subpoena
power.
those
two
cases
by
the
way
are
general
trade
school
against
the
united
states
in
212
f.2d
656,
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit
last
year
and
carol
vocational
institute
against
the
united
states
in
211
f.2d
539
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
last
year.
now,
what
we
say
is
that
if
as
all
three
circuits
have
held,
this
kind
of
problem
is
a
matter
material
and
relevant
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
that
sustains
the
conclusion
of
those
courts
because,
"as
to
any
such
matter,"
the
statute
says,
"the
subpoena
power
is
available."
so,
there's
no
need
to
look
elsewhere
in
the
act
to
find
a
power
of
investigation
and
subpoena
with
respect
to
any
such
specific
matter.
that
power
is
given
precisely
in
section
235
(a).
and
the
question
is
as
it
was
considered
by
the
three
circuits,
as
it's
been
considered
by
the
parties
on
both
sides,
is
this
kind
of
investigation
such
a
matter.
if
it
is,
investigation
and
subpoena
are
provided
for
here.
now,
nobody
has
suggested
because
i
think
the
suggestion
would
be
baseless
that
the
attorney
general's
regulations
in
8
cfr
340.11,
providing
for
denaturalization
investigation
are
improper,
unreasonable,
unauthorized
or
that
the
similar
regulations
in
the
--
under
the
prior
act
which
provided
with
similar
investigations
were
improper.
what
has
happened
now
is
that
the
subpoena
power
which
formerly
was
available
only
for
exclusion
and
deportation
is
now
available
for
any
matter,
material
and
relevant
to
the
--
to
the
enforcement
of
this
act
and
the
kind
of
investigation
undertaken
in
these
--
in
these
cases
is
such
a
matter.
now,
there
remains,
and
i'll
discuss
it
briefly,
the
question
whether
the
person
who
--
whose
naturalization
certificate
is
under
investigation
is
a
witness
within
the
meaning
of
235
(a).
and
on
that,
we
review
in
the
briefs
and
i
mentioned
yesterday
it's
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
an
administrative
investigation.
that
in
such
an
investigation,
there
are
no
parties
as
this
court
and
other
courts
have
held
for
this
purpose.
the
administrative
agency
functions
in
a
way
analogous
to
the
grand
jury
and
whose
proceedings
similarly,
there
are
no
parties.
now,
under
the
1917
act
when
the
subpoena
power
was
available
for
deportation
proceedings,
it
was
clear
and
it
was
held
by
the
third
and
ninth
circuits
and
a
few
district
courts
which
considered
the
problem
that
for
deportation
purposes,
a
subpoena
could
be
used
to
compel
the
testimony
in
attendance
of
a
person
whose
possible
deportation
was
being
considered.
now,
when
the
statute
has
been
broadened
so
that
it
covers
any
matter,
we
say
there
is
no
reason
for
reading
the
word
"witnesses"
more
narrowly.
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
that
congress
obviously
concerned
with
this
problem
of
denaturalization
and
broadening
this
familiar
subpoena
provision
would
warrant
the
word
"witnesses"
read
differently
from
the
way
it
had
been
read
so
as
to
exclude
the
person,
to
paraphrase
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
morton
salt
case,
the
person
best
able
to
give
the
information
sought
and
possibly
least
anxious
to
do
so.
so,
we
say
that
on
both
points,
the
propriety
of
the
subpoenas
in
these
cases
is
clear.
the
propriety
of
congress'
power
to
undo
fraudulent
naturalization
certificates
has
been
sustained
by
this
court.
there
is
nothing
harsh
or
shocking
about
the
concomitant
exercise
through
the
executive
of
the
power
to
get
the
facts
to
determine
whether
this
should
be
done.our
opponents
have
conceded
that
this
could
be
done
on
pretrial
discovery.
congress,
we
think
clearly
authorized
the
performance
of
this
function
as
a
matter
of
administrative
investigation.
we
think
that
this
way
of
handling
the
problem
is
a
sensible
one
and
a
fair
one,
always
backed
by
the
power
of
the
courts
to
prevent
oppression
and
unfairness
and
after
all
as
in
discovery,
the
courts
here
have
the
only
power
of
compulsion
to
enforce
these
subpoenas,
the
high
standard
of
proof
to
denaturalize,
the
admitted
seriousness
of
denaturalization.
these
remain
unchanged,
but
nobody,
we
think,
seriously
did
not
dodge
the
power
of
congress
to
authorize
such
investigations
and
we
think
it
is
clearly
done
so
in
235
(a).
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
act
of
1940,
your
honor?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
you
mean
this
act?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
act
of
1952?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there
was
a
nationality
act
of
1940.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
don't
know
certainly.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
probably
not,
your
honor.
now,
i
will
say
that
the
word,
"fraud"
was
dropped
because
it
was
thought
that
there
had
been
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
substantively,
the
naturalized
citizen
has
as
tied
a
hole
on
his
naturalization
certificate
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
substantively
as
he
ever
had.
procedurally,
congress,
i
think
made
clear,
its
desire
that
in
proper
cases,
revocation
proceedings
be
pursued
expeditiously.
for
example,
congress
rewrote
the
rule
this
court
wrote
in
(inaudible)
and
now,
because
congress
was
anxious
that
fraudulent
naturalization
certificates
be
wiped
out
as
quickly
and
expeditiously
as
possible,
it
provided
that
state
rules
regarding
vacation
of
decrees
in
term
time
could
contrary
to
the
(inaudible)
decision
be
invoked
to
vacate
naturalization
decrees.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
oh,
no
your
honor,
not
at
all.
for
example,
the
person
may
fail
to
meet
the
good
moral
character
requirement
though
he
has
not
committed
a
crime.
he
may
fail
to
meet
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
the
resident's
requirement.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
the
--
that
under
section
1425
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
insofar
as
the
investigation
armed
with
this
subpoena
power,
may
seek
answers
to
questions
which
could
lead
to
criminal
prosecution,
the
privilege
is
available.
now,
last
month
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
your
honor.
last
month,
the
costello
case
was
before
this
court
and
certiorari
was
denied.
and
there,
there
was
a
plea
of
privilege
on
pretrial
discovery
in
a
denaturalization
suit.
the
plea
of
privilege
was
rejected
because
there,
the
statute
of
limitations
had
ran
on
criminal
prosecution
on
those
matters
as
to
which
the
plea
was
interposed.
it's
a
harder
question
if
the
statute
has
not
ran
on
the
criminal
prohibition
against
fraudulent
obtaining
of
naturalization,
whether
questions
could
be
asked
which
would
surmount
a
plea
of
privilege.
but
of
course,
i
would
add
that
we
have
no
pleas
of
privilege
here,
but
simply
a
like
its
refusal
to
avail
the
subpoenas.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
regulations
of
the
attorney
general
provide
for
the
investigation
by
immigration
officers
of
criminal
violations
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
laws.
i
know
of
no
case
where
a
person
has
been
subpoenaed,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
he
has
committed
a
crime.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
the
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
always
bearing
in
mind
that
the
plea
of
privilege
is
available.
other
agencies
too
as
--
i've
mentioned
only
one
example,
mr.
justice
cardozo's
observation
in
the
jones
case.
other
agencies
too
investigate
criminal
violations
of
their
laws.
and
the
subpoena
provisions
in
the
various
statutes
contain
--
either
contain
a
compulsory
testimony
and
immunity
provision
or
are
opened
to
claims
of
privilege.
but
in
either
case,
it
is
a
proper
and
is
not
an
--
infrequently
happened
that
an
administrative
agency
is
investigating
a
possible
criminal
violations
of
the
laws
it
administers.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
the
internal
revenue
authorities
do
have
such
power
and
i
might
say
in
that
connection
that
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
reply
brief
filed
by
mr.
fay
that
this
power
to
compel
a
testimony
under
the
internal
revenue
laws
is
not
used
with
respect
to
possible
criminal
violation.
and
that
suggestion
is
based
on
the
testimony
of
a
revenue
agent
at
a
criminal
trial.
well,
the
testimony
is
misleading
and
the
fact
is
as
i
think
the
court
knows
from
its
examination
of
tax
evasion
cases
that
these
investigative
powers
are
used
with
respect
to
criminal
violations.
the
--
the
very
heart
of
the
subject
of
the
investigation
for
internal
revenue
purposes
is
whether
somebody
has
underpaid
his
tax,
and
that
is
customarily
an
element
in
a
criminal
offense.
the
person
comes
in,
he
may
plead
his
privilege,
but
i
have
brought
with
me
a
mimeograph
of
the
internal
revenue
service
which
quite
clearly
shows
by
its
restrictions
on
the
use
of
this
power
that
subpoenas
are
used
in
cases
where
there
may
be
possible
criminal
violations.
and
then,
as
i
say,
the
privilege,
if
it
is
appropriate,
is
available.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
i
said
that
literally,
this
extends
the
investigation
of
crimes.
i've
checked
with
our
immigration
people
and
i
know
of
no
case
where
the
subpoena
has
used
--
been
used
in
a
criminal
investigation.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
not
--
there's
no
need
for
the
court
to
go
this
far.
we
don't
have
a
criminal
investigation
here.
we
have
--
you
see,
let
me
say
this.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
there
might
be
one
and
i
don't
think
in
this
case,
the
court
ought
to
reach
that
more
difficult
problem.
take
--
take
this
point.
in
criminal
prosecutions,
the
government
does
not
have
available
to
it
pretrial
discovery
against
the
defendant.
our
opponents
conceive
that
this
way
of
finding
the
facts
is
available
with
respect
to
denaturalization.
on
the
same
way,
when
you
subpoena
in
somebody
for
purposes
of
a
purely
criminal
investigation,
you
trench
on
the
area
of
the
privilege
and
you
may
raise
a
question
which
does
not
arise
here
as
to
whether
you
would
have
bring
him
at
all.
now,
i
know
of
no
case
in
the
immigration
service
so
far
where
there
has
been
done.
and
what
i
say
is
that
if
you
apply
the
plain
language
of
235
(a)
to
reach
this
matter,
which
we
think
is
squarely
within
it,
it's
unnecessary
now
to
decide
how
you
would
treat
a
matter
where
purely
criminal
investigation
was
being
fortified
by
the
use
of
the
subpoena.
thank
you.
