justice
harlan
now,
absent
--
absent
a
allegation
that
the
state
knew
that
he
was
using
perjured
testimony
what
federal
question
do
you
ask?
justice
harlan
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
really
arguing
is
that
if
you
have
a
little
perjured
testimony
in
the
state
prosecution
then
you
can't
that
you
don't
raise
a
federal
question
as
the
state
knew
about
but
if
you
have
a
lot
of
it
and
you
do
raise
a
federal
question
even
though
the
state
didn't
know
about
it.
justice
harlan
comes
out
in
a
case
that
goes
that
far.
justice
harlan
perhaps
i
shouldn't
ask
you
this
question
but
i'm
just
curious.
it
was
such
an
extraordinary
sentence
in
view
that.
was
any
application
made
within
the
state
for
executive
clemency?
justice
harlan
perhaps
i
shouldn't
have
asked
the
question
in
this
period.
justice
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
going
back
to
the
page
4?
as
i
read
this,
this
is
--
is
all
consistent
with
this
having
gone
back
a
couple
of
times
on
the
same
day.
i
understand
the
state
denied
the
allegation.
justice
harlan
is
this
the
present
petition
that
we're
looking
at?
justice
harlan
oh,
i
see.
justice
harlan
still
it
falls
short
on
that
allegation,
doesn't
it,
the
same
what
i've
suggested.
i'm
saying
that
it
was
and
simply
a
single
taking?
justice
harlan
mr.
bowen
--
justice
harlan
do
you
regard
this
sentence
as
a
very
unusual
one
for
this
type
of
offense?
justice
harlan
if
you
--
if
your
opponent
has
got
no
objection,
i
--
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
think
led
to
these
sentences.
it's
practically
a
life
sentence
on
this
man
for
stealing
six
animals.
justice
harlan
well,
you
should
better
not.
