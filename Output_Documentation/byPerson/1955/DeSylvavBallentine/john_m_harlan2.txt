justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
suppose
the
thrust
of
that
argument
would
lose
some
weight
if
children
is
--
held
to
exclude
the
illegitimates.
justice
john
m.
harlan
illegitimate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
--
as
to
the
question,
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
are
you
clear
about
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can't
the
statute
be
read,
now,
i
was
looking
at
it,
can't
the
statute
be
read
under
your
construction
as
giving
her
the
whole
title
to
the
copyright
and
to
--
she
can
dispose
of
it
by
will?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
not.
well,
that's
the
question
i
had.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
say
this
expiration
would
have
been
in
1909
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
an
illegitimate
child
a
dependent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
--
i'm
confused
as
to
what
your
position
is.
i
thought
a
moment
ago,
you
led
me
to
believe
at
least
that
you
were
construing
this
statute
just
the
way
you'd
approach
the
construction
of
a
will.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
let
me
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
you
had
a
will,
of
course,
and
the
word
"children"
is
used
in
it,
it's
a
question
of
the
intent
of
the
testator.
now,
is
it
your
contention
here
that
the
use
of
the
word
children
is
to
be
determined
by
what
congress'
intent
was
in
using
that
word
in
the
statute
or
is
congress'
intent
to
be
--
to
be
construed
in
terms
of
the
way
that
word
is
used
in
the
--
under
state
law,
the
fact
it
has
under
state
law
dependent
upon
the
domicile
of
the
person
concerned,
the
child
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
reference
to
state
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then
you
do
throw
state
law
situs
as
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
obviously
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
nature
of
things
as
far
as
the
widow
and
widower
are
concerned,
it
has
to
be
in
the
disjunctive,
doesn't
it?
you
can't
have
both
--
