mr.
theodore
kiendl
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
involved
the
construction
of
the
renewal
of
sections
of
the
federal
copyright
act.
the
opinion
below
was
by
circuit
judge
stephens.
it
was
concurred
in
by
circuit
judge
chambers
and
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
by
circuit
judge
fee.
we
should
point
out
immediately
that
the
dissenting
opinion
of
circuit
judge
fee
went
off
on
a
jurisdictional
ground
which
is
not
being
raised
or
presented
to
this
court
in
connection
with
this
appeal.
the
action
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california
in
the
central
division
by
the
guardian
ad
litem
of
the
estate
of
the
infant
and
illegitimate
son
of
the
late
george
de
sylva.
the
action
was
brought
against
his
widow
and
the
action
was
one
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
which
this
infant
through
his
guardian
ad
litem
attempted
to
get
a
declaration
of
his
rights
under
the
renewal
section
of
the
copyright
law
and
an
accounting
from
the
widow
of
george
de
sylvia
where
the
moneys
and
benefits
and
advantages
that
she
derived
from
renewing
the
copyrights
herself.
the
facts
were
all
--
either
stipulated
or
undisputed
and
they
were,
i
can
recite
them
fairly
briefly,
substantially
these.
george
de
silva
was
a
prolific
and
a
very
outstanding
songwriter,
a
writer
of
popular
music
with
such
famous
individuals
as
jerome
kern
and
george
gershwin
and
others.
he
had
collaborated
during
a
long
period
of
time,
most
of
--
this
half
of
the
20th
century,
in
producing
a
number
of
very
popular
song
hits.
the
list
of
most
of
them
is
contained
in
one
of
the
briefs
in
this
case.
i
only
mentioned
two
that
probably
some
members
of
this
court
are
familiar
with.
one
song
was
"california
here
i
come"
another
was
"april
showers"
and
songs
of
that
general
character
were
in
the
portfolio
that
this
particular
individual
was
the
author
of
or
collaborated
with
others
and
being
the
author
of.
during
the
last
28
years
of
his
life,
he
had
copyrighted
a
great
many
of
this
song
hits.
he
died
in
the
year
1950
and
he
left
him
surviving
this
widow
who
obtained
renewals
on
the
copyrights
as
he
came
to
be
eligible
for
renewal
and
of
course
many
more
of
them
will
become
illegible
for
renewal
from
now
on
until
the
year
1978,
28
years
after
his
death.
he
also
left
him
surviving
an
infant
son.
a
son
born
out
of
wedlock
but
the
son
whose
paternity,
the
late
george
sylva
acknowledged
during
his
lifetime.
and
the
son
came
in
and
on
the
proposition
that
under
the
provisions
of
the
copyright
act
he
had
equal
rights
with
the
widow.
he
sued
for
this
declaratory
judgment
and
in
accounting
of
the
proceeds
of
what
the
widow
would
obtain
through
which
of
these
renewals.
the
case
came
on
in
the
district
court
but
was
not
tried.
it
was
disposed
of
on
motion.
both
sides
made
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment
and
on
this,
what
we
say
here
was
substantially
agreed
statements
of
fact.
the
district
court,
the
district
judge
decided
the
case
in
favor
of
the
widow.
there
was
no
opinion
in
the
district
court
but
there
were
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
which
appear
here
in
the
transcript
of
record.
and
the
substance
in
effect
of
them
were
that
the
widow
was
the
sole
and
exclusive
owner
of
those
renewal
rights
that
became
illegible
for
renewal
during
her
lifetime
and
that
the
infant
son
was
not
entitled
to
any
accounting,
whatsoever.
however,
we
should
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
did
hold
that
the
son,
the
illegitimate
son
was
a
child
of
george
de
sylva
within
the
meaning
of
the
provisions
of
the
copyright
law.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
i
don't
know
how
it
came
to
reach
it,
your
honor,
but
he
reached
it
and
exist
--
contained
in
the
findings
of
fact,
one
of
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
record,
i
can
take
the
time
to
point
it
out
of
--
it's
in
there.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
well,
he
decided
both
questions,
one
definitely
on
our
favor
and
gave
us
summary
judgement,
the
other
definitely
against
the
son
as
other
proposition.
now,
when
judgment
was
ended
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff,
guardian
ad
litem
took
an
appeal
and
the
defendant
widow
cross-appealed,
cross-appealed
from
the
conclusion
of
law.
i
think
it's
--
the
conclusion
of
law
is
number
two.
i
have
a
note
of
it
here,
on
page
32
of
the
transcript
of
record
which
said
that
the
infant
was
a
child
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
law
and
both
appeals
came
on
to
be
heard
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
all
that
he
said,
your
honor
please,
is
left
contained
in
the
conclusion
of
law
which
appears
on
page
32,
number
two,
that
stephen
william
ballentine,
that's
the
child,
is
a
child
of
george
g.
de
sylva,
deceased,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
relating
to
copyrights.
it
says
nothing
else
in
the
record
anywhere
to
indicate
anything
to
the
contrary.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
reversed
and
the
conclusion
of
law
from
which
the
defendant
widow
appeals
was
affirmed.
so
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
went
against
us
on
both
grounds.
we
then
applied
for
and
obtained
this
certiorari.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here,
the
defendant
widow
below,
that
the
answers
to
the
two
questions
that
came
up
before
the
court
of
appeals
were
--
and
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
those
answers
were
wrong.
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
right
and
that
it
should
be
reinstated.
in
the
opinion
of
judge
stephens,
it
took
this
form.
he
posed
and
he
answered
two
specific
questions.
the
first
question
appears
at
page
49
of
the
record
and
as
it
--
they're
both
very
short.
may
i
read
them?
the
first
question,
at
page
49
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
is
the
widow
in
a
class
with
a
child.
judge
stephens
proceeds
to
discuss
that
question
and
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
it
should
be
answered
in
the
affirmative,
putting
the
widow
in
the
same
class
with
the
child.
he
then
propounds
opposers
to
the
second
question
at
page
56
of
the
record.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
question
is
there
set
forth
as
a
heading,
is
the
illegitimate
child
excluded
from
all
rights
under
the
renewal
privileges
of
the
copyright
act?
and
after
discussing
that
question,
judge
stephens
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
should
be
answered
in
the
negative
so
that
the
illegitimate
child
was
not
excluded
by
that
court
from
the
rights
from
renewal
privileges
under
the
copyright
act.
now,
we
come
at
once
to
the
precise
and
exact
language
of
the
statute
itself.
the
statute
in
section
24
of
the
copyright
law
and
for
convenience
we
have
put
it
in
as
an
appendix
to
--
to
our
brief
and
it
appears
at
page
21
of
our
brief.
it's
headed
section
24,
duration,
renewal
and
extension
and
it
provides
in
the
first
part
that
the
copyright
should
endure
for
28
years.
and
then
it
further
provides,
and
this
is
the
vitally
important
provision
of
the
act.
it
must
be
construed
in
this
case.
it
provides
down
toward
the
bottom
part
of
the
page
that
the
author
of
such
work,
if
still
living
or
the
widow,
widower
or
children
of
the
author
if
the
author
be
not
living
or
if
such
author,
widow,
widower
or
children
be
not
living
then
the
author's
executors
or
in
the
absence
of
a
will,
his
next
of
kin
shall
be
entitled
to
a
renewal
and
extension
of
the
copyright
for
a
further
period
of
28
years.
now,
as
we
read
that
language
segregating
it
entirely
from
any
of
the
familiar
aids
to
statutory
construction
and
taking
the
words
just
as
they
appear
to
find
out
what
congress
actually
said.
we
think
those
words
are
susceptible
of
only
three
possible
constructions.
one,
that
we
advance
and
that
we
think
is
sound
and
two
others
that
we
reject.
the
first
one
is
taking
the
language
and
the
principal
language,
of
course,
is
widow,
widower
or
children.
we
take
that
language
in
what
we
call
the
"alternative
sense.
"giving
to
the
word
"or"
its
alternative
dictionary
meaning,
either
the
widow
or
the
children,
one
or
the
other
but
not
both.
and
if
we
consider
that
possible
construction
of
the
language,
it
seems
to
us
it
comes
to
the
ridiculous
conclusion
that
congress
has
left
it
suspended
in
midair
as
to
what
was
going
to
determine
which
one
of
the
two
would
take
if
both
didn't
take.
and
that
construction
is
not
adopted
by
either
party
to
this
appeal
and
we
submit
is
unsound
and
should
not
be
adopted.
the
second
sense,
the
second
possible
construction
of
the
language
and
the
one
that
we
here
urge
upon
this
court
is
construing
the
words
"or
children"
in
the
substitutionary
sense
in
the
sense
that
dictionaries
define
the
word
"or"
in
most
instances.
if
there'd
be
no
widow,
then
in
that
event
the
children
are
substituted
in
our
place
and
we
rely
for
that
construction
--
pardon
me,
i
have
slight
cold.
we
rely
for
that
construction
on
a
line
of
cases
involving
the
law
of
wills,
testamentary
transfers
of
property
by
will
where
a
testator
leaves
his
property
either
real
or
personal
property
to
a
named
individual
or
his
child.
and
these
various
cases
the
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
there,
i
think,
there
are
eight
of
them,
all
hold
that
in
that
situation
the
child
only
takes
in
substitution
for
the
named
individual
if
a
named
individual
be
not
alive
at
the
time
of
the
death
of
the
testator.
but
the
plaintiffs
here,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
the
guardian
ad
litem
claims
that
that
situation
is
wholly
inapplicable
to
the
disposition
of
this
contention
for
the
reason
that
those
cases
involved
only
testamentary
transfers.
they
don't
involved
a
copyright
law.
they
referred
to
the
law
of
inheritance
from
the
law
of
succession
and
consequently,
have
no
application
here
but
we
don't
quite
see
the
reasoning
behind
that.
it
seems
to
us,
if
the
language
is
susceptible
of
that
construction
under
a
will
it
would
be
susceptible
of
that
construction
under
the
copyright
law.
and
we
think
those
cases
are
clearly
analogous
to
a
situation
here
presented.
and
we
want
to
call
the
court's
specific
attention
to
one
rather
interesting
case
that
were
found
by
--
not
counsel
for
the
petitioners,
by
one
of
the
counsel
for
--
one
of
the
friends
of
the
court
and
that
is
the
cutting
case,
cutting
v.
cutting,
a
rather
old
case
decided
in
1881
in
the
district
court
of
oregon.
and
it's
referred
to
in
the
brief,
trial
by
the
motion
picture
association
in
this
case
as
amicus
at
page
7.
that
case
involved
the
construction
of
a
provision
of
the
donation
act,
the
federal
donation
act
where
the
donees
where
married
persons
and
it
contained
this
provision
and
i
read
just
a
sentence
from
page
7
of
their
brief."
and
either
shall
have
died
before
the
patent
issue.
the
survivor
and
children
or
heirs
of
the
deceased
shall
be
entitled
to
the
share
or
interest
of
the
deceased
in
equal
proportions."
there
was
a
case
where
the
federal
statute
used
both
the
word
"and"
and
the
word
"or,"
both
the
conjunctive
and
the
disjunctive.
and
in
interpreting
the
language
in
that
case,
the
district
court
of
oregon,
i
think,
it
was
then
the
circuit
court
decided
that
the
words
"the
heirs"
would
have
to
be
construed
as
meaning
that
the
heirs
could
only
take
in
the
form
of
children.
the
act
substitutes
then
for
children
in
case
there
are
no
children.
that
decision
we
think
is
quite
apposite
to
the
situation
that
we
are
contending
for.
now,
the
third
possible
construction
is
the
one
that
the
plaintiff,
respondent
contends
for.
they
say
that
the
words
"widow"
or
children
mean
in
substance
widow
and
children
that
the
word
"or"
is
both
conjunctive
and
disjunctive.
and
that
we
submit
purely
from
the
standpoint
of
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
that
injects
into
the
statute
something
that
is
not
there.
but
if
we
leave
this
strict
language
of
the
statute
and
go
to
those
age
which
enabled
courts
to
construe
and
interpret
the
provisions
of
federal
statute.
we
come
first
to
the
question
as
to
what
was
the
purpose,
what
was
the
object
of
this
particular
statute.
now,
of
course
we
all
know
in
its
fundamental
that
the
copyright
act
was
the
exercise
by
congress
of
the
power
committed
to
it,
specifically
by
section
8
of
article
1
of
the
constitution
which
provides
that
congress
should
have
power
to
promote
the
progress
of
science
and
the
useful
arts
by
securing
for
a
limited
time
to
authors
the
exclusive
right
to
their
writing.
and
if
that
constitution
provision
indicates,
as
we
think
it
does,
that
the
purpose
of
the
objective
of
the
copyright
act
was
to
provide
additional
benefits
for
the
authors
of
these
writings
then
we
submit
that
the
contention
and
interpretation
advanced
by
the
respondent
here
is
untenable
and
would
defeat
the
very
purpose
of
the
act.
for
it
--
it
seems
to
us
it
must
be
obvious
that
if
we're
going
to
put
any
value
into
the
writings
of
an
author
that
value
is
determined
by
the
marketability
of
his
product.
what
can
you
sell
it
for?
how
much
will
the
market
pay
for
it?
and
if
the
prospective
purchaser
is
unable
to
acquire
a
good
and
sufficient
title,
if
there
be
any
cloud
on
that
title,
the
value
of
the
writing
depreciates
and
diminishes
and
in
some
instance
might
vanish
entirely.
and
if
the
prospective
purchaser
of
the
moving
picture
rights
of
a
play
or
the
perspective
purchaser
of
a
musical
competition
--
a
composition
has
got
to
deal
with
all
these
people
in
order
to
get
good
and
sufficient
title,
we
submit
he
will
refuse
to
negotiate
or
bargain
it
all.
must
he
go
and
find
the
widow
of
the
songwriter
and
the
legitimate
children
of
the
songwriter?
and
must
he
exhaust
the
possibility
of
there
being
any
illegitimate
children
in
order
to
acquire
the
kind
of
a
title
that
he
needs
with
the
exclusivity
that
is
so
essential
to
the
production
of
a
motion
picture
play
or
to
the
production
of
music?
of
course,
he
is
not
going
to
do
that.
and
we
say
that
means
that
the
value
of
the
word
is
seriously
depreciated.
there
is
a
case
cited
in
the
brief
for
the
motion
picture
association
again
in
this
case
which
i
think
i
should
call
to
the
court's
attention
and
we
call
it
to
the
court's
intention
not
--
attention
not
because
we
are
familiar
with
the
facts
but
as
a
sort
of
a
hypothetical
situation.
there's
a
play
on
broadway
that
is
a
tremendous
success.
it
was
produced
by
an
american
playwright
but
it
was
based
on
a
following
play
by
a
foreign
author.
the
one
of
the
great
motion
picture
companies
were
interested
in
acquiring
the
motion
picture
rights
to
that
play.
and
negotiations
had
continued
to
the
point
where
there
were
some
suggestion
of
the
payment
of
something
over
a
half
million
dollars
for
the
motion
picture
rights
of
that
play
when
suddenly
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
case.
and
the
prospective
purchase
there
forewarned
by
the
decision
for
which
we
are
appealing,
went
to
the
trouble
as
a
prudent
businessman,
tried
to
ascertain
what
was
the
true
situation.
and
the
situation
that
developed
reputedly
was
that
the
foreign
author
of
the
play
had
children.
he
had
twice
as
many
reputedly,
illegitimate
children
that
were
known
and
there
were
some
indication
that
there
were
unknown
illegitimate
children
that
could
not
be
located.
in
that
situation,
the
negotiations
evaporated
and
the
american
playwright
of
that
play,
at
least
for
the
time
being,
was
deprived
of
a
very
substantial
sum
of
money.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
that
is
correct,
sir.
but
it
is
in
the
light
of
the
decision
of
the
court
below
that
children
included
to
the
--
mr.
theodore
kiendl
--
illegitimate
and
that
took
place.
so
that
we
say,
judging
this
by
the
purpose
of
the
statute
desired
to
accomplish.
the
construction
that
we
contend
for
is
the
one
that
should
be
adopted
by
this
court.
now,
we
pass
to
another
aid
to
construction
and
that
is
the
history
of
the
act
itself.
that
history
was
very
carefully
reviewed
by
this
court
in
1942
in
the
fisher
company
against
witmark
case
and
i
don't
want
to
go
through
that
entire
history
but
very,
very
briefly.
the
first
copyright
act
was
adopted
in
1790
and
it
provided
for
an
original
term
of
14
years
and
the
renewal
term
of
14
more
years.
but
it
confined
the
renewal
to
a
situation
where
the
author
was
living
at
the
end
of
the
first
term.
if
the
author
died
before
the
end
of
the
first
term,
the
copyright
determined
and
the
author's
work
went
into
the
public
domain.
40
years
after
the
adoption
of
that
original
statute,
approximately
40
years
after,
in
the
year
1831,
the
copyright
act
was
substantially
revised
and
the
term
--
the
original
term
was
put
up
from
14
years
to
28
years
and
the
"renewal
term,"
as
i
call
it,
continued
for
14
years
but
there
was
a
provision
that
its
family,
the
widow
and
children
would
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
that
14
year
renewal
term.
the
exact
language
of
that
statute
was
this,
and
i
hate
to
read
so
much
but
it's
quicker
to
read
than
to
try
to
paraphrase
and
i
want
to
be
accurate
in
each
of
these
instances.
the
language
of
that
statute
is,
"if
the
author
being
dead
shall
have
left
the
widow
or
child
or
children,
either
or
all
living,
the
right,"
--
that's
the
copyright,
"continued
to
such
widow
and
child
or
children
for
this
renewal
period
of
14
years."
now,
that
statute
remained
unrevised
on
the
books
from
1831
for
another
period
of
almost
40
years
until
1870
when
the
copyright
act
was
again
substantially
revised
after
considerable
legislative
consideration.
there
were
hearings
in
1870,
i
think,
public
hearings,
but
in
any
rate
the
act
was
given
very
serious
consideration
before
it
was
substantially
revised
in
1870.
and
there
the
act
provided
instead
of
what
was
in
the
1831
act,
that
the
renewal
should
go
to
the
author
or
his
widow
or
children,
if
he
be
dead,
they
shall
have
the
same
right
for
a
period
of
14
years.
there
the
conjunctive
that
was
in
the
19
--
1831
statute
was
omitted
from
the
1870
statute
and
the
language
either
all
living
that
was
in
the
1831
statute
was
admitted
in
the
1870
statute.
another
period
of
almost
40
years
went
by
when
in
1909
pursuant
to
a
message
from
president
roosevelt
to
the
congress
regarding
the
necessity
of
considering
the
revision
of
a
copyright
act,
a
new
copyright
act
was
enacted
in
1909.
and
that
copyright
act
contained
the
same
provision
so
far
as
the
words
"widow
or
children"
were
concerned
but
in
many
respects
changed
the
pre-existing
law.
it
was
that
act
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
in
his
opinion
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
witmark
case
as
one
that
was
adopted
after
elaborate
legislative
considerations
and
it
was
pointed
out
in
that
opinion
that
the
19
--
the
1909
act
differed
very
substantially
from
the
bills
that
have
been
previously
introduced
in
that
situation
during
the
prior
years
from
the
president's
message
in
1906,
i
think
it
was
until
1909.
but
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
1909
revision
the
congress
was
not
unmindful
of
the
prior
provisions
in
the
act
regarding
widow
or
children
because
there
they
went
to
the
trouble
of
putting
in
and
inserting
in
the
revised
act
an
additional
word,
the
word
"widower"
to
cover
the
possibility
perhaps
of
the
existence
of
an
authoress
rather
than
an
author.
now,
we
claim
that
that
history
of
the
act
shows
clearly
that
congress
intended
to
get
away
from
the
provisions
of
the
1831
act
by
the
1870
act
that's
been
in
existence
ever
since
and
that
--
that
statutory
history
shows
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
put
the
widow
in
a
separate
and
distinct
class
from
the
children.
now,
the
plaintiff
claims
precisely
the
opposite
of
that
and
they
--
i
say
the
plaintiff
was
a
guardian
ad
litem,
regarding
ad
litem
claims
that
there
was
a
provision
in
a
draft
of
a
bill
that
was
submitted
to
congress
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1909
legislation
which
provided
for
the
separation
of
the
widow
and
children
into
two
distinct
classes,
that
that
draft
was
not
adopted.
consequently,
it
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
to
create
two
separate
classes
but
only
one.
the
clause
in
the
draft
that
they
refer
to
reads
that
the
copyright
may
be
further
renewed
by
the
author
or
he
is
--
he
be
dead,
leaving
a
widow,
by
his
widow
or
in
her
default,
or
if
no
widow
survive
him,
by
his
children.
we
point
out
--
mr.
theodore
kiendl
i'm
reading
from
quotation
of
that
clause
in
the
draft
that
appears
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
at
page
9.
we
point
out
in
connection
with
that
draft
language
in
a
--
an
entirely
different
view
that
there's
no
indication
in
the
history
of
that
legislation
that
that
was
intended
to
be
either
a
restatement
of
the
existing
law
or
a
correction
of
the
existing
law.
but
it
was
in
connection
with
the
law
that
was
quite
radically
different
from
the
one
that
was
finally
adopted.
it
had
an
entirely
different
term
in.
it
covered
the
periods
so
far
as
music
--
musical
authors
were
concerned.
those
that
wrote
popular
music
could
cover
the
one
single
term
and
the
term
for
life
plus
a
period
of
50
years.
but
the
guardian
also
claims
that
the
changes
that
were
made
in
19
--
in
1870
and
in
1909
were
not
intended
to
interfere
in
anyway
with
preexisting
rights
that
they
have
remained
exactly
the
same
as
they
had
been
in
1831
and
continued
in
that
same
condition
right
down
to
date.
we
hardly
think
that's
any
adequate
explanation
for
the
various
substantial
and
radical
changes
in
the
statute
that
we've
already
referred
to.
now,
another
aid
to
statutory
constructions
would
be
what
comfort
we
could
possibly
get
from
the
decisions
of
the
courts
and
from
the
text
writers
and
the
commentators.
so
far
as
court's
decisions
are
concerned
there
were
none
that
squarely
determined
this
point.
but
there
are
two
decisions
that
contain
intimations
or
suggestions
that
we
think
can
only
be
construed
as
very
favorable
to
our
side
of
this
controversy.
the
first
run
is
in
the
case
of
silverman
against
the
sunrise
pictures
which
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
in
an
opinion
written
by
judge
hart.
there,
the
question
presented
was
simply
stated
by
judge
hart
as
one
whether
the
rights
under
copyright
law
resulting
from
an
application
by
only
some
of
the
asset
law
of
the
author
preserved
the
right
to
a
renewal
of
a
copyright.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
very
famous
book
written
by
an
authoress
and
the
copyright
that
she
had
acquired
expired
in
1915.
she
died
in
1909,
six
years
before
the
expiration
of
the
original
term.
she
left
a
will.
the
will
provided
for
the
copyright
to
go
to
a
certain
specific
way.
the
will
was
probated.
the
executors
qualified.
they
administered
the
estate.
they
were
discharged
in
1911.
and
when
1915
came
around,
the
28th
year
of
the
original
copyright,
two
of
the
authoress'
sisters,
only
part
of
her
heirs
at
law
or
next
to
kin
applied
for
and
obtained
the
registration
renewal.
when
the
motion
picture
company
that
tried
to
buy
the
moving
picture
rights
to
that
book
was
about
to
produce
the
motion
picture,
someone
came
in
and
suggested
that
he
was
going
to
do
it.
so,
the
motion
picture
company
brought
suit
to
obtain
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
this
infringer
from
doing
what
he
threatened
to
do.
the
infringer
only
took
the
position
that
the
motion
picture
company
had
no
title
to
that
renewal.
the
district
court
denied
the
application
for
the
preliminary
injunction.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
granted
the
preliminary
injunction
and
in
the
course
of
the
opinion,
judge
hart
said
this,
he
said
that
the
purpose
of
these
renewal
provisions
was
to
give
to
the
persons
enumerated
in
the
order
of
their
enumeration
a
new
right
or
estate.
we
say
that
that
seems
to
us
to
mean
very
clearly
that
the
court
there
considered
that
the
person's
enumerated
from
the
section
in
the
order
of
their
enumeration,
that
is
the
author,
the
widow,
the
children,
the
executor
and
the
next
of
kin
took
in
that
order
just
as
we
contend
here.
now,
that
decision
was
not
necessary
for
the
disposition
of
that
case
but
it
seems
to
us
to
be
indicative
of
what
the
thought
was
at
that
time
at
least
and
that
was
in
the
year
1921
and
we
come
to
the
decision
of
this
court,
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
there
was
a
case
where
the
sole
question
was
whether
there
was
anything
in
the
act
that
prohibited
an
author
from
assigning
his
renewal
rights
prior
to
the
time
that
he
had
secured
them
and
this
court
answered
that
question
in
the
negative.
in
the
opinion
in
that
case,
although
it
does
not
appear
in
the
body
of
the
opinion
and
is
in
a
footnote,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
you
had
this
to
say
regarding
the
situation
there.
may
preface
that
for
a
minute
by
calling
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
case
involved
musical
--
a
piece
of
popular
music,
"when
irish
eyes
are
smiling."
and
there
were
three
coauthors
including
chauncey
olcott,
two
of
them
were
dead.
mr.
ball
was
dead
and
mr.
olcott
were
dead
and
they
both
left
children.
in
the
footnote
in
that
case
this
was
said,
ball
and
olcott
are
no
longer
living
and
under
section
23,
and
i
again
digress
section
23
is
the
present
section
24
exactly,
and
under
20
--
section
23,
their
interest
in
the
renewal
passed
to
their
widows.
now,
of
course
that
wasn't
essential
to
that
decision
and
maybe
considered
in
the
nature
of
over
the
dicta
but
it
seems
to
us
indicative
of
the
trend
of
judicial
thinking
on
that
subject.
i
pass
from
the
court
decisions
to
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
we
cite
in
our
brief.
we
cite
it
as
the
opinion
of
the
assistant
attorney
general
fowler
but
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
we'd
like
to
correct
that
to
this
extent
that
that
opinion
indeed
signed
by
a
assistant
attorney
general
fowler
was
approved
specifically
by
attorney
general
wickersham
and
it
was
an
opinion
on
copyright
law
that
was
sent
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
it
says
squarely
that
this
extensions
or
renewal
rights
under
the
1909
copyright
act
shall
pass
to
persons
and
in
the
order
mentioned
just
exactly
as
the
court
said
in
the
silverstein
case
that
i've
read.
now,
that
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
who
was
rendered
one
year
after
the
act
was
enacted.
we've
also
pointed
out
a
number
of
text
writers,
lecturers
who've
taken
substantially
the
same
position
that
we've
taken
here.
one
is
the
article
in
corpus
juris
and
corpus
juris
secundum
on
copyright
law
by
mr.
hale
in
which
he
takes
the
same
position.
another
is
an
article
in
american
jurisprudence
that
takes
the
same
position
and
there
are
others
that
we
mentioned.
we
did
rely
to
some
extent
on
a
statement
contained
in
a
book
on
copyright
law
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
de
wolf.
we
referred
to
it
at
page
11
in
our
brief
where
mr.
de
wolf
said
squarely,
the
renewal
can
only
be
obtained
by
the
beneficiaries
expressly
named
in
the
law
and
by
then
in
the
author
names,
i.e.
the
person
having
the
first
right
is
the
author,
if
living
at
the
end
of
the
original
term.
if
he
is
not
living,
then
the
widow
or
widower
is
entitled
to
renew.
if
there
is
no
widow
or
widower,
the
children
come
in.
we
submitted
that
to
the
court,
a
square
support
for
our
position
but
we
were
rather
surprised
than
indeed
temporarily
a
little
embarrassed
when
we
received
the
brief
submitted
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
on
behalf
of
the
register
of
copyrights
in
which
he
called
attention
to
another
statement
by
the
same
mr.
de
wolf
who
was
a
copyright
lawyer
and
one
time
the
acting
register
of
copyrights,
a
statement
in
the
letter
that
he
had
sent
to
a
very
prominent
copyright
lawyer
in
new
york,
in
the
year
1944.
in
passing,
i
would
like
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
the
solicitor
general
says
specifically
that
the
office
of
the
register
of
copyrights
is
not
taking
any
position
on
the
issue,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
illegitimate
child
is
a
child
within
the
meaning
of
the
section,
that's
a
footnote
at
page
3
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
and
in
connection
with
the
other
question,
the
more
important
one
we
think,
at
the
end
of
the
brief,
the
solicitor
general
brief
states
that
the
memorandum
doesn't
dares
that
there
can't
be
no
question
as
to
the
correct
legal
interpretation
of
the
section
that
its
purpose
is
to
repeal
what
mr.
de
wolf
said
in
1944.
the
copyright
office
has
never
felt
that
the
matter
was
clear
enough
to
justify
taking
the
position
that
a
child
could
not
renew
so
long
as
the
widow
is
living.
now,
in
connection
with
this
statement
of
mr.
de
wolf's,
the
letter
is
included
as
an
appendix
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
at
pages
26,
27
and
28
and
the
letter
starts
with
a
statement
from
mr.
de
wolf,
the
question
of
whether
the
widow
takes
precedence
over
the
children
and
renewal
copyrights
has
never
been
settled.
my
own
view
is
that
they
are
members
of
one
class
which
is
somewhat
different
from
the
view
he
took
in
1925
that
i
have
read,
but
he
goes
on
to
explain
at
the
end
of
that
letter,
i'm
reading
from
the
bottom
of
page
27,
at
any
rate
the
office
has
never
felt
that
the
matter
was
clear
enough
to
justify,
taking
the
position
that
a
child
could
not
renew,
so
long
as
the
widow
is
living.
our
policy
as
you
know
is
to
register
the
renewal
in
the
name
of
any
beneficiary
which
seems
reasonably
entitled
and
leave
the
apportionment
of
interest
among
various
beneficiaries
to
be
settled
by
them
or
by
a
court
if
needs
should
arrive.
we
--
after
receiving
that
brief
obtained
a
copy
of
the
letter
to
which
that
is
an
answer
and
it's
a
letter
from
mr.
johnson,
rather
famous
copyright
lawyer
who
participated
in
connection
with
the
hearings
in
the
1909
act,
in
that
letter
we
had
included
in
our
reply
brief
and
it
shows
clearly
that
mr.
johnson
at
least
squarely
supported
the
view
for
it
--
for
which
we
are
here
contending.
now,
there
are
other
grounds
contended
for
by
circuit
judge
stephens
in
his
opinion
below
that
we
could
call
attention
to.
do
i
have
a
few
more
minutes
your
honor?
yes,
the
light
will
come
on
when
you
--
when
you
(inaudible)
he
said
that
in
construing
this
act
there
was
no
separating
phrase
between
the
words
"widow
and
children"
and
that
consequently
there
were
four
categories
instead
of
the
five
that
we
contended
for.
the
first
category
was
the
author
and
that
was
qualified
by
the
words
"if
still
living."
the
second
category
was
the
"widow
or
children"
and
that
was
qualified
by
the
words
"if
the
author
be
not
living."
the
third
category
was
the
executors
and
if
there
were
no
will,
the
fourth
category,
the
next
of
kin.
now,
that
conclusion,
we
submit,
does
not
construe
the
language
as
it's
written
but
rather
puts
into
the
language
something
that
is
not
there,
although
mr.
circuit
judge
stephens
does
say
in
his
opinion
that
he's
giving
to
the
word
"or"
it's
full
disjunctive
meaning
and
we
can't
comprehend
just
what
was
meant
by
that,
how
you
can
give
the
word
"or"
it's
full
disjunctive
meaning
by
converting
it
into
the
word
"and."
i
just
want
to
pass
hurriedly
to
the
second
question
in
the
case,
this
question
regarding
illegitimacy.
the
word
"children"
has
been
in
this
statute
continuously
since
1831.
that
it
mean
in
1831
to
1870,
to
exclude
illegitimate
children,
to
include
them
from
1870
on
or
did
it
mean
this
one
and
the
same
thing
at
all
times.
there
is
no
intimation
anywhere
in
the
statute
that
the
word
"children"
included
illegitimates.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
congressional
intention
to
include
illegitimates
in
the
word
"children"
as
used
in
the
statute.
and
at
common
law
we
all
agree,
under
the
law
of
england,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
statutes
would
always
be
construed
when
they
contain
the
word
"children"
to
exclude
"illegitimates."
and
we
think
the
same
thing
has
been
true
in
this
country
to
a
very
large
extent,
although
concededly
there
are
some
decisions
that
indicate
somewhat
to
the
contrary.
but
there
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
mccool
against
smith
decided
in
the
year
1861
in
66
united
states
where
this
court
said
--
can
i
just
read
too
short
sentences?"
by
the
rules
of
common
law,
terms
of
kindred
when
used
in
the
statute
include
only
those
who
are
legitimate
unless
a
different
intention
is
clearly
manifest.
this
is
conceded
by
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
in
error,
the
proposition
is
too
clear
to
require
either
argument
or
authority
to
sustain
it.
now,
the
court
below
mentioning
that
very
decision,
says
it
probably
would
have
been
more
correct
if
it
had
been
confined
to
questions
involving
title
or
inheritance
to
real
property,
but
that
it
was
not
applicable
to
the
situation
of
construing
the
word
"children"
under
the
copyright
law.
and
the
court
below
cite
some
cases
which
involved
questions
we
think
can
be
distinguished
from
the
one
here
involved
where
there
were
such
words
as
"children
and
--
or
dependent
relatives"
and
the
words
"dependent
relatives"
in
connection
with
the
word
"children"
were
used
to
include
illegitimates.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
i
should
think,
if
your
honor
it
please,
you
have
to
take
the
former,
the
first
proposition
you
suggested,
construe
it
under
the
federal
law.
the
word
"children"
is
used
in
the
federal
law.
it
has
specific
meaning
at
the
time
it
was
put
in
the
federal
law.
we
think
it
continues
to
have
that
same
meaning
down
to
date.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
to
be
ascribed
to
it.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
and
--
then
the
state
decisions
bring
up
the
question
of
possible
dependency
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
we
think
that
is
so,
that
has
been
so.
but
here
there
were
decisions
in
this
very
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
we
thought
were
absolutely
our
way.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
two
of
them.
i
can't
pronounce
the
first
name
of
the
first
case
because
it
was
a
chinese
girl
and
the
first
name
was
--
begins
with
ng,
i
suppose
that's
pronounced
a
name,
but
there
are
two
cases,
one
was
ng
suey
hi
against
the
commissioner
of
education,
the
other
was
louie
wah
you
against
the
commissioner
of
education.
those
cases
were
cases
of
comparatively
recent
origin
decided
unanimously
by
the
same
ninth
circuit
court
and
they
were
decided
in
1927
and
1928
under
these
circumstances.
a
chinese
girl
on
the
first
case,
a
chinese
boy
or
man
in
the
second
case
tried
to
enter
this
country
and
they
were
stopped
by
the
immigration
authority.
they
suit
out
writs
of
habeas
corpus
to
compel
their
admittance
to
this
country.
the
district
court
discharged
the
writs,
denied
them
admittance,
they
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
refusal
to
admit
them.
in
that
situation,
there
was
a
statute
which
appears
in
the
opinion
at
page
66.
the
statue,
the
immigration
statute
or
citizenship
statute
contained
this
language,
"all
children
born
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
whose
fathers
maybe
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
are
declared
to
be
citizens
of
the
united
states."
and
under
that
statute,
these
two
children,
both
illegitimate,
contended
that
the
very
language
of
that
statute
the
"word
children"
included
them
specifically.
the
court
said
no.
now,
when
this
case
came
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit,
they
didn't
distinguish
that
case,
they
didn't
quite
overrule
it,
although
apparently
they
rejected
the
reasoning
of
the
opinion
below,
the
opinion
in
the
two
other
cases.
there
they
said
this,
"mr.
--
circuit
judge
stephens,
sir,
we
don't
think
that
the
doctrine,"
that's
the
doctrine
of
nullius
filius,
"the
doctrine
so
squarely
considered
and
met"
--
i'm
sorry,
we
don't
think
the
doctrine
was
so
squarely
considered
and
met.
in
either
case,
as
to
require
us
to
hold
that
it
applies
under
the
principle
of
stare
decisis
but
although
the
opinions
weren't
extended
in
either
of
those
two
chinese
immigration
cases,
we
submit
that
that
doctrine
was
squarely
considered.
it
had
to
be
squarely
considered.
it
was
the
only
doctrine
involved
in
the
case.
it
was
the
only
issue
in
the
case
and
it
had
to
be
squarely
met
and
it
was
squarely
met
and
decided
in
our
favor.
now,
i
have
two
other
points
that
i'd
like
to
make
rather
hurriedly.
in
reading
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
some
members
of
this
court
make
it
the
impression
that
they
are
applying
to
the
principles
here
involved
some
measure
equity
or
good
conscience
that
the
defendant
widow
in
this
case
is
invoking
harsh,
and
ancient
doctrines
to
defeat
these
children,
this
child,
this
illegitimate
son
of
a
right
provided
by
a
federal
statute
and
the
whole
tenor
of
the
brief
is
that
the
statute,
as
we
interpret
it,
would
constitute
a
preference
or
a
priority
for
this
widow
that
she's
been
discriminated
in
favor
of
and
against
children,
legitimate
or
illegitimate.
we
submit
that
that
just
isn't
so.
that
the
statute
in
fact,
as
we
understand
it,
prefers
that
it
--
prefers
anybody,
the
children
of
the
author
because
here
is
a
situation
where
an
author
during
the
last
28
years
of
his
life
produces
a
lot
of
music
books
and
he
copyrights
them.
those
copyrights
become
illegible
for
renewal
after
his
death,
after
28
years
and
the
first
period
of
five
years
or
10
years
or
however
long
the
widow
may
normally
be
expected
to
outlive
him.
those
renewal
rights
belong
to
her
and
to
her
exclusively.
but
during
the
entire
remainder
of
the
second
renewal
--
of
the
second
period
for
the
renewal,
the
period
in
this
case
would
be
probably
from
1960
to
1978.
the
renewal
rights
on
all
these
words
passed
exclusively
to
the
children
so
that
there's
no
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
widow
under
the
statute
but
the
discrimination
of
any
as
in
favor
of
the
children
who
inherit
--
who
don't
inherit
to
take
despite
the
laws
of
inheritance,
despite
any
will
whatever
remains
and
accrues
after
the
death
of
the
widow.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
i
think
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
we
think
absolutely
not.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
the
renewal,
of
course,
you
can't
renew
a
copyright
until
after
27
years
have
expired.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
it's
only
during
the
28th
year
that
you
can
renew
it.
and
if
the
widow
be
dead,
of
course,
she
can't
renew
it.
consequently,
we
don't
see
that
she
has
any
right
that
she
can
take
in
those
renewed
periods
after
her
death
by
will
or
otherwise
that
they
all
pass
unimpaired
to
the
children
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
contention
raised
by
anybody
to
the
contrary.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
he
could
assign
his
rights
under
fisher
against
--
mr.
theodore
kiendl
--
witmark
and
no
question
about
that
during
his
lifetime
and
that
would
be
valid,
if
he
were
living
at
the
time
that
the
copyright
became
illegible
for
renewal.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
no,
he
had
no
right
to
assign
away
the
widow's
rights
or
the
children's
rights.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
only
his
own
rights.
now,
one
other
thing
and
we
think
this
is
a
rather
important
consideration
for
this
court
and
that
is
that
this
copyright
law
singularly
enough
is
absolutely
silent
as
to
any
division
or
distribution
that
should
be
made
if
the
plaintiff's
contention
is
sound
whether
the
widow
takes
one
half,
the
child
takes
one
half,
if
there
are
five
children,
does
the
widow
take
one-sixth
and
each
one
of
the
five
children
take
one-sixth.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
statute
regarding
that
and
we
point
out
that
in
other
statutes,
comparable
statutes,
we
think
the
donation
act
that
was
involved
in
the
cutting
case
to
pay
an
allowance
to
the
statute
that
we
cite
in
our
brief.
they
both
provide
in
situations
analogous
to
that
contended
for
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
to
her
estate.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
if
she's
exercised
the
right
of
renewal
promptly,
that
belongs
to
her.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
that's
right,
sir,
for
that
particular
renewal.
now,
under
those
two
statutes
there
is
a
provision,
specific
provision,
that
they
take
an
equal
proportions
or
an
equal
shares.
there's
nothing
of
that
kind
in
this
copyright
act
and
we
submit
that's
another
consideration
that
warrants
the
conclusion
that
congress
had
in
mind
from
1870
on
to
date
that
the
widow
takes
and
becomes
the
sole
owner
of
those
renewal
rights
that
accrue
or
mature
or
become
eligible
during
her
lifetime.
we
therefore
submit
that
their
decision
below
was
wrong,
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
our
favor
should
be
reinstated.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
we
have
nothing
more
to
add,
your
honor.
