justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
end
case
whether
in
deciding
that
he
was
the
child
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
law,
a
child
in
the
copyright
law
should
be
given
a
definition
as
such
or
whether
he
was
child
because
local
laws
applied
in
that
with
california
law.
that
indicates
that
it's
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kiendl,
do
we
not
have
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
whether
the
statute
needs
to
be
construed
as
a
federal
statute
in
the
meaning
as
such
or
rather
the
term
children
is
to
be
construed
referring
to
state
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
follow
your
argument
mr.
kiendl
that
it
is
to
have
a
--
if
it
were
a
federal
meaning
but
there
are
statutes
of
course
that
--
that
was
(inaudible)
the
appropriate,
this
court
has
said
that
children,
that
local
state
meaning
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
applied
to
all
the
first
education
that
--
for
the
estate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
argue
whether
under
the
copyright
statute
the
scope
of
the
meaning
of
the
content
of
"for
children"
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
criminal
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
arguing
that
children
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
include,
covers,
recognized
illegitimacy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
matter
what
the
statute
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
generously
taken
a
lot
of
needless
territory,
i'd
like
to
say.
i
know
that's
(inaudible)
to
either
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
do
think
one
has
to
come
to
the
questions
--
a
position
in
this
case
whether
children
is
a
class
--
the
scope
of
which
is
to
be
defined
by
state
law
or
whether
it
is
--
it's
a
concept
that
has
to
get
meaning
in
interpreting
a
federal
law
irregardless
of
what
hardly
we
would
say,
irregardless
of
what
state
law
requires.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
one
has
to
face
that
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
the
state
--
state
law
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
understand
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
put
to
you
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
a
very
simple
one.
here,
the
federal
statute
will
give
certain
rights
to
children,
now,
i
do
not
think
it
is
universally
true
that
children
in
any
statute
include
illegitimate
as
well
as
legitimate
children.
i
should
think
until
very
recently
would
be
opposite
to
the
defense.
now,
if
children
in
a
federal
statute
is
to
be
given
the
meaning
that
we
have
to
--
the
court
has
to
give
to
us
as
a
matter
of
federal
construction,
that's
one
problem.
if
children
in
the
context
of
this
statute
requires
the
court
to
look
the
pleading
and
scope
and
concept
of
children
according
to
the
domiciliary
state
which
the
controversy
arises
then
we
have
to
look
to
california
law
and
of
course
this
court
has
--
when
a
--
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
what
california
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
we
think
--
the
hutchinson
case
precisely
brings
out
the
point
to
which
i
--
you
define
the
difficulty
to
its
question,
namely,
the
hutchinson
case
went
not
on
the
--
not
on
the
construction
of
what
the
term
meant
that
is
true
nationwide
but
it
said
it
can
be
referred
to
be
governed
by
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
hutchinson
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
case
in
which
in
the
federal
statute
creating
certain
rights
and
certain
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
court
held
that
the
content
of
the
class
must
be
determined
by
that
into
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
that
--
if
that
rule
wouldn't
be
adapted
in
this
case
then
we
look
to
california
and
we
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
this
long
history
of
social
policy
and
since
they
look
to
what
california
has
decided
to
include
under
the
term
called
next
of
kin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
if
we
--
if
that
is
the
rule,
if
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
mean,
if
the
principle
of
that
case,
namely,
that
rights
created
by
the
--
by
a
federal
statute
are
to
be
given
its
application
regarding
the
beneficiaries
according
to
who
would
be
the
beneficiary
under
state
law
then
they
look
to
the
state
law
and
they
don't
follow
by
--
the
roman
law
and
unfairness
to
illegitimate
children
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
think
that's
quite
right
but
you
--
you
can't
--
you've
got
to
give
some
guiding
consideration
meaning
to
those
who
hold
the
other
view,
because
the
other
view
would
have
to
be
that
it
is
federal
law
that
governs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
could
extend
on
california
law
which
makes
--
recognize
illegitimate
children,
children.
then
you
must,
in
another
case
which
--
in
which
another
state
in
which
that
is
not
the
law
reached
the
opposite
conclusion.
you
can't
say
it
depends
on
whatever
law
favors
your
position.
that
is
not
a
rule
of
law,
that's
a
rule
of
preference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
view
what
the
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
your
position,
then
you
don't
look
to
state
law.
i
understand
that
too
but
i
don't
understand
switching
which
ever
position
seems
to
bring
about
the
result
you
desire.
i
can
understand
that
as
a
human
preposition
but
not
as
a
lawyer's
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
congress
thought
it
necessary
to
put
in
widower
shows
how
little
--
how
little
light
one
can
get
from
the
mere
words
of
the
statute
because
in
merely
changing
social
condition,
in
lieu
meaning,
the
terms
certain
these
days
after
dealing
with
this
kind
of
a
subject
since
they
have
the
word
widow,
could
be
read
to
mean
male
or
female
and
therefore
widow,
unless
congress
thought
it
necessary
to
be
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
they
provide
for
distribution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
any
light
of
what
was
intended
by
congress
other
than
the
words
in
the
statute?
any
light
at
all,
just
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
--
congress.
i
believe
you
to
say
that
congress
presented
that
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
nothing
more
than
the
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
light,
gets
it
all,
or
it
has,
it's
a
one
child,
referring
to
your
view,
gets
one
quick
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
you
inferred
the
intention
of
congress
(inaudible)
to
the
dissenting
opinion,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest,
he
did
in
this
ground,
they
didn't
want
to
spill
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
merely
find
the
intention
of
congress.
