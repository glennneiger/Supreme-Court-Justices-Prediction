mr.
max
fink
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
george
g.
de
sylva
was
a
composer
and
author
of
songs.
in
his
earlier
years,
some
of
his
compositions
became
very
important.
some
of
those
were
renewed
during
his
lifetime
and
some
of
his
songs
were
not
renewed
within
the
statute,
section
24
of
title
17
of
the
copyright
act.
and
it
is
those
compositions
which
were
not
renewed
during
the
lifetime
of
the
decedent
which
concern
us
in
this
case.
the
questions
presented
here
are
as
follows.
first,
does
the
surviving
spouse,
in
this
case
the
widow,
take
those
renewed
copyrights
granted
by
congress
to
certain
dependents
of
the
deceased
author?
does
the
widow
take
those
renewals
to
the
exclusion
of
the
child
or
children?
and
secondly,
is
an
acknowledged
illegitimate
child,
a
child
within
the
meaning
of
section
24
of
the
act.
i
believe
it
would
be
appropriate
to
say
and
the
record
reveals
that
the
child
here
was
not
just
an
illegitimate
child
out
of
the
blue.
this
child
enjoyed
the
company
and
society
and
the
love
of
his
father,
and
in
respect
to
the
law
of
california,
is
an
acknowledged
child,
formally
fully
acknowledged.
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
child
was
fully
legitimated,
was
one
that
was
not
admitted,
and
for
that
reason
that
issue
was
not
decided
in
the
trial
court
because
the
court
felt
that
under
the
facts
of
the
case
which
were
admitted
and
stipulated
in
most
instances
that
the
child
was
a
child
within
the
meaning
of
section
24
of
the
act.
mr.
max
fink
we
will
argue
--
mr.
max
fink
it
is
our
contention
that
a
child
is
the
progeny
of
human
parents
and
is
a
child
under
every
--
any
law
--
mr.
max
fink
--
particular
--
no
matter
--
mr.
max
fink
no
matter
what
the
--
what
the
state
law
maybe.
however
--
mr.
max
fink
well,
i
--
i
believe
that
since
the
question
has
been
raised
that
we
should
also
urge
that
in
the
event
of
the
status
of
the
child
comes
in
question
here,
we
will
argue
that
that's
status
must
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
domicile
which
has
the
strongest
social
interest
in
the
persons
within
his
domicile.
mr.
max
fink
i
believe
that
--
mr.
max
fink
yes.
we
do
face
it
and
we
believe
that
the
decisions
of
the
courts
adequately
demonstrate
that
this
child
is
a
child
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
law
in
question
here
and
is
a
dependent
recognized
by
at
law.
mr.
max
fink
yes.
mr.
max
fink
however,
i
believe
that
we
should
be
accorded
the
privilege
suggesting
that
if
the
status
of
the
child
becomes
an
issue
in
this
cause
and
no
matter
what
your
honors
would
--
would
wish
to
pass
upon,
that
that
status
must
be
determined
in
accordance
with
state
law
and
that
there
is
no
federal
law
which
may
determine
the
status
of
a
child
in
california.
mr.
max
fink
well
--
mr.
max
fink
perhaps
i
can
--
mr.
max
fink
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
max
fink
well,
may
i
cover
the
subject?
i
should
like
first
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
--
excuse
me
--
we
are
concern
here
only
with
the
renewal
clause
of
the
copyright
act.
in
other
words,
the
copyright
under
our
present
laws
granted
for
28
years
with
the
right
given
to
certain
classes
of
persons
to
obtain
that
renewal
for
an
additional
28
years.
and
that
our
matter
here
involves
only
the
renewal
provision
of
the
act.
we
note
first
of
all
that
the
renewal
provisions
of
the
act
contemplates
dependents
of
the
author,
and
that
the
act,
the
renewal
act,
was
adapted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
dependents
of
an
author.
and
we
suggest
without
painstaking
the
child
regardless
of
the
legal
status
of
its
parents
is
a
dependent
of
the
author.
now,
this
matter
has
been
before
the
courts
on
numerous
occasions
not
in
the
precise
or
problem
presented
here.
but
the
courts
have
consistently
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
renewal
act
is
to
protect
the
widows
and
the
children
of
the
deceased
author
from
the
supposed
improvidence
of
authors.
the
--
there
is
no
other
reason
for
having
a
split
term
of
copyright.
congress
had
before
it,
rather
the
copyright
law,
contentions
were
made
that
there
should
be
one
long
term
of
copyright
protection.
the
congress
consistently
since
the
very
--
the
first
enactment
in
1790,
the
copyright
laws
provided
in
this
country
a
split
term
and
the
reason
for
the
split
term
or
second
term
of
copyright
is
to
give
a
new,
a
fresh
and
unfettered
right
directly
to
those
persons
whom
congress
designates
as
the
dependents
of
the
author.
we
must
assume
that
congress
recognized
that
it
would
be
shocking
to
have
the
--
those
dependents
of
one
who
has
contributed
great
good
suffer
from
lack
of
funds.
as
we
have
enunciated
in
the
cases
that
the
second
provision
of
the
second
copyright
is
clearly
intended
to
protect
the
widow
and
children,
and
the
debates
in
congress
indicate
clearly
that
that
was
the
purpose
for
the
renewal
portion.
and
we
suggest
that
there
was
not
much
reason
for
a
split
term
of
copyright
except
that
the
second
term
given
fresh,
given
new
directly
to
these
persons
designated
by
the
statute.
that
gives
them
a
new
and
unfettered
right
and
claim.
and
we
therefore
submit
that
the
copyright
act
itself
is
the
strongest
and
most
persuasive
argument
that
the
concept
of
nullius
filius,
as
known
in
the
ancient
law,
does
not
apply.
it
is
true
that
in
the
early
stages
of
the
common
law,
there
was
a
concept
of
nullius
filius
which
arose,
i
believe,
as
a
matter
of
evidence.
it's
easy
to
prove
the
marriage,
church
records
and
no
other
evidence
was
submitted.
however,
this
doctrine
has
been
considerably
changed
and
transplanted
and
all
of
the
cases,
i
believe,
without
any
specific
exception,
have
applied
that
doctrine.
there
are
exceptions
which
i
believe
have
been
--
have
been
from
time
to
time
of
old
rule
which
have
applied
that
doctrine
only
to
matters
of
inheritance
and
to
no
other
matter.
we
note
that
the
--
renewal
portion
of
the
copyright
act
is
not
a
hereditament.
the
new
right
goes
directly
not
through
any
estate
to
the
widow
and
the
children.
and
it
is
--
mr.
max
fink
well
this
court
has
ruled
in
the
case
where
the
opinion
was
announced
by
justice
frank
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
case
of
fisher
versus
witmark,
318
u.s.
has
considered
great
number
of
the
problems
which
we
are
considering
here
today,
although,
not
our
specific
type
of
case.
and
the
court
clearly
recognized
--
this
court
has
recognized
that
these
rights
go
direct
to
the
statute
so
it
directly
provides.
it
is
true
that
if
the
author
is
not
living
--
mr.
max
fink
yes
sir,
yes.
they
--
the
renewal
right,
the
franchise
which
the
government
grants.
mr.
max
fink
well,
the
cases
have
all
consistently
held.
mr.
max
fink
the
cases
have
all
uniformly
held
including
the
pronouncement
of
this
court
and
the
fisher
versus
witmark
case
that
the
renewal
right
goes
directly
to
those
persons
name
and
does
not
go
into
an
estate.
and
of
course,
we
suggest
that
is
still
the
law.
now,
the
word
children,
of
course,
may
vary
from
time
to
time
as
justice
holmes
has
said
in
the
case
of
towne
versus
eisner,
245
u.s.,
the
word
is
not
a
crystal,
transparent,
and
unchanged.
it's
the
skin
of
a
living
thought.
and
they
vary
greatly
in
color
and
content
according
to
the
circumstances
from
the
time
on
which
it
is
used.
it's
also
been
said
that
words
have
different
connotation
dependent
upon
circumstances,
the
time
of
social
aspects.
the
ancient
doctrine
of
nullius
filius
if
applied
by
this
court
would
mean
the
following.
because
of
common
law,
there
were
no
adaptions,
there
were
no
legitimations,
there
were
no
acknowledgments,
it
would
mean
to
all
children
born
of
a
void
or
illegal
marriage,
all
children
born
of
punitive
marriage,
all
children
born
of
a
meretricious
relationship,
all
children
adopted,
all
the
children
acknowledged,
all
the
children
legitimate,
would
all
be
left
out
of
the
benefits
conferred
by
congress
upon
the
dependents
of
an
author.
and
in
this
day
and
age,
this
could
not
be
the
result
that
was
intended
and
it
cannot
be
the
law.
mr.
max
fink
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
recognize
that
the
statute
--
the
statute
which
we
have
today
is
in
substance,
a
formulation
insofar
as
widow
and
children
are
concerned,
of
the
same
statute
that
we
had
in
1831.
but
it
has
been
reenacted
with
varying
degrees
on
numerous
occasions,
it
was
reenacted,
for
example
in
1940
with
slight
changes
that
deal
with
subjects
with
which
we're
not
concerned
here.
the
law
was
codified
in
1947,
now
our
section
24.
and
each
of
these
reenactments
of
this
law
must
be
viewed,
i
believe,
separately
as
the
intention
of
congress
at
the
time
of
each
of
the
reenactments.
it
maybe
well
to
cite
to
the
court
the
case
first
national
bank
versus
beach,
301,
united
states
in
which
it
is
held
that
even
words
of
a
statute
do
not
have
a
changeless
connotation
and
that
they
just
likewise
change
with
time
and
with
surrounding
condition
and
color.
but
particularly
in
this
case,
insofar
as
the
doctrine
of
nullius
filius
is
concern,
i
would
say
even
in
1831,
its
application
then
and
prior
to
that
time
were
strictly
in
matters
of
inheritance
and
the
right
to
hold
church
--
of
a
church
office.
it
has
never
been
applied
consistently
beyond
that
point.
and
since
the
statute
in
1831
which
provided
the
renewal
right
to
dependents
specifically
granted
the
right
directing
to
those
dependents
not
through
any
estate.
it
becomes
clear
that
the
right
was
never
a
hereditament
to
be
construed
at
any
time
under
the
term
nullius
filius.
mr.
max
fink
he
is
a
dependent
under
--
mr.
max
fink
so
far
as
--
we
know
illegitimate
child
is
a
dependent
under
every
social
concept
that
we're
under
the
law
of
this
country
generally
and
universally,
i
believe,
a
dependent
of
his
father
and
of
his
mother
and
was
universally
provide
that
there
is
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
parents
to
support
their
child.
and
peculiarly
enough,
i
believe
in
this
country,
universally
in
this
country
at
least,
laws
require
that
child
to
support
its
parents.
no
distinction
is
made
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates
insofar
duty
of
support
is
concern.
now
the
question
is,
are
we
to
punish
this
particular
child
in
this
society
which
we
live
for
something
that
his
parents
were
responsible
for.
petitioner
relies
on
the
case
of
mccool
versus
smith
mentioned
yesterday,
66
u.s.,
but
i
believe
we
should
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
case
was
again
considered
23
years
later
by
this
honorable
court
in
the
case
of
hutchinson
investment
company
versus
caldwell,
152
u.s.
and
the
court
in
1894
reconsidering
that
case
expressly
limited
the
application
of
the
mccool
case
to
the
particular
statute
in
the
state
of
illinois
that
has
to
do
with
next
of
kin.
and
by
the
way
the
term
next
of
kin
is
quite
a
different
term
from
the
word
child.
it's
quite
a
different
term
from
the
word
dependent
also.
petitioners
--
mr.
max
fink
there
are
several
cases
to
which
i
will
cite
to
your
honor
which
that
rule
has
been
held.
mr.
max
fink
yes,
and
there
are
--
mr.
max
fink
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
fink
that
is
true
in
the
hutchinson
case
and
in
subsequent
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
max
fink
i
believe
one
of
the
leading
cases
on
that
--
on
the
same
subject,
your
honor,
is
the
case
of
seaboard
air
line
versus
kenney
which
is
240
u.s.
cited
in
1916.
in
which
the
court
clearly
held
that
who
are
next
of
kin
is
to
be
determined
by
the
legislation
of
the
particular
estate
involved.
mr.
max
fink
but
that
deals
with
who
are
next
of
kin,
not
who
is
a
child.
mr.
max
fink
well,
if
i
--
i
believe
that
i
should
cover
the
ground
in
case
some
of
the
other
honorable
justices
may
hold
some
different
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
max
fink
well,
it
was
contended
in
the
seabord
case
that
there
should
be
a
federal
law
or
to
produce
uniformity,
and
of
course,
the
court
--
this
court,
honorable
court
held
in
1916
that
to
attempt
to
produce
uniformity
upon
such
a
subject
in
federal
law
would
merely
promote
a
greater
disharmony
and
irreconcilable
differences
in
all
the
other
forms
in
the
several
states.
mr.
max
fink
yes,
your
honor,
we
--
we
do
if
we
--
if
--
in
the
alternative,
if
i
may
suggest.
mr.
max
fink
i'm
personally
constrained
to
--
my
personal
feeling
is
that
a
child
is
a
child
under
the
--
mr.
max
fink
and
--
and
that
--
to
that,
when
the
word
child
is
used
not
next
of
kin
or
similar
words
of
import
in
a
will,
the
word
child
to
be
determined
from
the
dictionary
is
a
progeny
of
human
parents.
but
if
the
court
wants
to
look
further
and
--
mr.
max
fink
--
and
referring
to
the
statutes.
mr.
max
fink
well,
we
look
to
both.
the
statutes
of
california
is
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
provide,
first
of
all,
a
child
is
a
dependent
and
must
be
supported
whether
he
is
acknowledged
or
not.
and
this
is
true
not
only
in
the
civil
law
or
section
of
the
civil
law
but
also
true
under
the
criminal
law.
and
we
also
find
the
city
of
california,
it's
printed
out
in
our
briefs
that
the
parent
has
the
right
to
have
an
illegitimate
child
support
the
parent
in
the
event
the
parent
was
indigent.
mr.
max
fink
no,
we
are
not.
this
is
the
thought
that
i
wish
to
point
out
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
heirship
here
because
this
is
something
that
congress
bestows
directly
upon
the
classes
of
persons
involved.
by
the
way,
the
petitioner
yesterday
cited
the
two
california
cases,
the
chinese
cases
which
we
--
were
decided
in
1928
by
the
same
circuit
that
decided
our
case.
we
call
them
the
yellow
peril
case
or
the
invasion
of
the
yellow
horde
because
at
that
time
in
california,
there
was
considerable
opposition
to
the
in
--
tremendous
influx
of
asiatics.
and
the
court
in
our
case,
the
very
same
circuit
decided
these
cases,
29
years
after
those
decisions,
those
decisions
by
the
way
stand
alone,
has
renounced
those
decisions
and
taken
an
entirely
different
view
after
considering
those
cases.
however,
and
i
should
also
note
that
despite
the
two
california
asiatic
cases,
the
--
allegedly
congress
adapted
a
statute
because
of
the
difficulty
of
proving
that
the
child
had
american
blood
in
its
veins,
adapted
the
statute
that
required
that
a
child
either
be
legitimate
or
legitimated
in
order
to
become
--
brought
into
the
country
from
a
foreign
country
and
become
a
citizen.
and
--
however,
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
copyright
act.
there
is
no
provision
in
the
copyright
requiring
the
child
be
legitimate
or
otherwise.
i
should
mention
that
even
after
the
adaption
of
the
--
of
the
citizenship
statute
requiring
a
legitimate
or
legitimated
children
that
the
case
of
compagnie
generale
transatlantique
was
decided,
that
was
27
da
f.supp.
in
which
the
court
of
claims
held
that
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
had
--
who
had
acknowledged
an
illegitimate
child
living
in
cuba,
at
the
time
he
lived
in
cuba
that
that
child,
even
under
the
statute
of
citizenship
became
a
citizen
of
this
country
by
that
acknowledgement.
with
due
apology
to
the
court,
i
don't
tend
to
ride
with
the
homes
and
the
heirs
as
both
but
i
do
believe
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
look
to
status,
we
should
consider
the
cases
this
court
has
passed
on,
passed
upon
in
the
past
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
law
of
the
domicile
which
has
the
strong
social
interest
in
the
relationships
of
people
should
be
looked
to,
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
child
is
a
child
within
the
meaning
of
an
act.
mr.
max
fink
i
--
mr.
max
fink
oh,
exactly
to
the
contrary.we
don't
construe
the
statute
as
a
testamentary
disposition
at
all.
it
is
a
grant
of
benefits
directly
by
congress
to
dependents.
mr.
max
fink
it
is
our
contention
that
since
the
federal
copyright
statute
has
no
provision
differentiating
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children,
acknowledged
children,
adopted
children,
or
any
other
type
of
children
who
would
be
excluded
by
the
rule
of
nullius
filius.
that
congress
intended
to
provide
for
children
who
are
the
children
of
the
author
or
the
child
of
the
author
and
his
dependents.
mr.
max
fink
without
reference
to
state
law.
the
state
law
may
only
be
inquired
into
if
this
court
is
of
the
--
should
reach
the
opinion
that
somehow
this
matter
is
related
to
intestacies
in
which
case
the
child
is
nevertheless
an
heir
to
the
law
of
california.
mr.
max
fink
in
general.
mr.
max
fink
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
middleton
versus
luckenbach,
226
f.2d,
the
question
arose
out
of
the
federal
death
act
which,
i
believe,
is
analogous
to
our
case
where
several
people
were
--
lost
their
lives
on
the
high
seas.
in
that
case,
several
cases
being
joined,
the
parents
sued
for
damages
for
the
loss
of
their
illegitimate
children
and
those
illegitimate
children
also
sued
for
damages
for
lost
of
their
--
lives
of
their
parents.
under
that
federal
death
statute,
the
court
stated
and
i
quote,
“there
is
no
right
of
inheritance
involved
here.
it
is
a
statute
that
confers
recovery
upon
dependents,
not
for
the
benefit
of
an
estate,
but
for
those
who,
by
our
standards,
are
legally
or
morally
entitled
to
support."
i'll
read
on.
"hence,
consideration,
humane
considerations
and
the
realization
that
children
are
such
no
matter
what
their
origin
alone
might
compel
us
to
the
construction
that
under
present
day
conditions,
our
social
attitude
warrants
a
construction
different
from
that
of
the
early
english
view."
the
court
there
goes
on
to
say,
“the
purpose
and
object
of
the
statute
is
to
continue
the
support
of
dependents
after
a
casualty.
to
hold
that
these
children
or
the
parents
do
not
come
within
the
terms
of
the
act
would
be
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
act.
the
benefit
conferred
beyond
being
for
such
beneficiaries
or
society's
welfare
in
making
provision
for
the
support
of
those
who
might
otherwise
become
dependent.
the
rule
that
a
bastard
is
nullius
filius
applies
only
in
cases
of
inheritance.
even
in
that
situation,
we
have
made
very
considerable
advances
towards
giving
illegitimates
the
right
of
capacity
to
inherit
by
permitting
them
to
have
inheritable
blood.
the
cases
also
hold
that
congress
recognized
--
and
by
the
way,
the
debates
of
congress
enacting
the
statutes
hold,
that
congress
recognized
it
by
the
very
event
of
death,
the
children
and
dependents
of
the
author
are
that
much
more
dependent
upon
the
value
of
the
renewed
copyright
and
upon
the
benefits
which
flow
from
it.
but
the
case
of
green
v.
burch,
a
california
case,
the
court
there
stated
that
the
doctrine
nullius
filius
is
no
longer
suitable
to
the
needs
of
the
people
and
it
cannot
be
regarded
as
part
of
the
law
today.
that
case
involved
a
state
statute
which
gave
benefits
to
the
children
or
dependents
of
soldiers,
persons
in
the
armed
forces.
we
must
all
bear
in
mind
considering
the
statute
that
the
author
is
often
a
female.
and
even
to
common
law,
a
child,
illegitimate
child
inherits
from
his
mother,
if
we
want
to
speak
in
terms
of
inheritance.
and
certainly,
as
a
child
with
a
mother
and
we
must
ask
petitioner
the
question,
suppose
in
this
case
the
author
had
been
a
woman.
would
petitioner
contend
that
the
child
of
that
woman
is
not
entitled
to
receive
the
benefits
of
the
--
bestowed
upon
it
by
the
act
of
congress.
the
--
referring
to
the
language
of
the
statute
discussed
yesterday,
copyright
act
as
it
now
reads
as
to
these
important
provisions
of
it
to
our
cause
that
the
author
of
such
work,
if
still
living
or
the
widow,
widower
or
children
of
the
author
if
the
author
be
not
living,
or
if
such
author,
widow,
widower
or
children
be
not
living,
then
the
author's
executors
or
in
the
absence
of
a
will,
his
next
of
kin
shall
be
entitled
to
renewal.
i
should
mention
even
though
in
the
absence
of
a
--
of
the
author,
the
widow,
and
children
that
--
the
widower
and
children
that
even
though
at
that
point,
the
executor
has
a
right
to
apply
for
renewal,
the
renewal
rights
do
not
go
onto
the
estate.
i
wish
particularly
to
note
the
language
of
the
section
which
clearly
demonstrates
that
there
are
four
classes
of
persons
entitled
to
obtain
the
renewal
right
and
each
one
of
these
classes
is
clearly
be
marked
and
defined
by
qualifying
phrases
at
the
end
of
each
class.
as
the
statute
reads,
the
author
of
such
work
is
still
living,
that's
the
first
class
or
the
widow,
widower
or
children
of
the
author,
if
the
author
be
not
living
is
your
second
class.
third,
if
the
author
be
not
living
or
such
author,
widow,
widower
or
children
be
not
living,
then
the
author's
executors,
qualifying
phrases,
each
separate
class
be
marked
separately.
mr.
max
fink
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
max
fink
goes
--
well,
this
has
been
a
question
and
this
troubled
the
copyright
bar
for
some
time.
presumably,
the
executor
has
a
power
of
appointment
to
give
those
copies
--
those
renewed
copyrights
directly
to
those
named
in
the
will
or
to
appoint
them
to
the
next
of
kin.
that
issue
is
not
before
us
here
but
it
has
not
been
completely
and
settled
except
that
the
cases
have
time
and
time
repeated
--
time
and
again
repeated
the
executor
may
apply
for
in
the
absence
of
a
--
of
children,
of
widow,
in
the
absence
of
a
widower.
but
they
do
not
go
into
the
estate
where
you
can
claim
some
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
mr.
max
fink
there
the
--
there's
no
case
directly
in
point,
your
honor,
with
the
exception
of
the
case
decided,
i
believe,
in
1916
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
government
in
which
the
executor
brought
an
action,
but
apparently
in
that
case
the
renewal
had
already
been
had
by
the
widow
and
children
in
the
case
of
two
authors
who
jointly
contributed
to
the
work.
and
the
court
there
held
that
the
widow
and
the
children
in
each
case
had
obtained
the
legal
right
to
the
copyright.
all
of
the
cases
however
mention
the
point
including
the
--
this
court
--
the
case
of
fisher
versus
witmark,
318
u.s.
and
it
seem
to
indicate
clearly
that
the
rule
is
that
they
do
not
go
into
the
estate.
the
argument
is
made
by
counsel
that
the
word
“or”
appears
between
the
class,
widow,
widower,
or
children.
therefore,
there
is
some
disjunctive
offered
in
that
sense
indicated.
the
word
“or”
as
used
in
the
act
and
by
the
way
which
is
demonstrated
by
the
very
next
clause
were
clearly
the
word
“or”
again
is
used
in
the
conjunctive
sense
in
the
same
statute
is
certainly
intended
to
create
the
class
of
widow,
widower
or
children.
the
words
again,
or
the
author
of
such
work
if
still
living,
or
the
widow,
widower
or
children
of
the
author,
if
the
author
being
not
living,
or
if
such
author,
widow,
widower
or
children
be
not
living,
then
the
author's
executors.
certainly,
what
the
congress
meant
was
that
if
the
author,
widow,
widower
and
children
were
all
not
living.
we
are
accustomed
to
saying
the
word
“or”
and
“and”
as
coordinating
particles
sometimes
not
precisely
used
and
quite
often,
they're
used
in
the
sense
of
“and/or”.
we
contend
insofar
as
the
class,
widow,
widower
and
children
are
concerned
that
the
word
“or”
is
actually
used
in
the
conjunctive.
in
other
words,
it
means
that
any
one
of
the
class,
widow,
widower
or
children
may
apply
for
the
renewal.
mr.
max
fink
but
if
they
all
own
it.
mr.
max
fink
that's
true.
and
the
entire
clause
is
phrased
in
the
disjunctive
that
--
to
the
effect
that
anyone
may
apply.
i
should
note
that
the
1831
statute
where
the
widow,
widower
had
no
rights.
the
1831
statute
talk
about
a
widow
and
children
before
the
widow
--
widower
arrived
upon
the
scene
by
the
1909
act.
very
clearly
in
that
act,
they
used
the
words
anyone
of
them
acting
and
the
requirement
that
any
one
of
them,
the
requirements
of
that
additional
clumsy
language
was
eliminated
by
revamping
of
the
statute
to
provide
widow,
widower
or
children,
which
means
anyone
of
them
acting.
mr.
max
fink
it
was
contended
by
petitioner
that
the
word
“or”
here
in
the
same
clause
is
--
if
it's
not
completely
disjunctive
is
used
in
the
alternative
and
they
depend
upon
cases
relating
to
wills
for
this
intention.
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
law
that
where
the
word
“or”
appears
in
a
--
even
a
will
or
a
deed,
that
this
word
means
substitution
or
altered.
it's
only
by
reading
the
four
corners
of
the
will
that
one
--
that
the
judge
is
permitted
to
determine
the
true
meaning
of
that
word.
and
i
suggest
that
reading
the
four
corners
of
our
statute
also
in
order
to
reach
that
determination,
we
will
find
that
the
word
is
used
not
only
in
the
conjunctive
but
also
in
the
disjunctive
in
that
same
clause
meaning
that
anyone
of
them
may
act
to
renew,
the
widow,
widower
or
children
and
if
they
all
have
rights
or
injustice,
in
a
case
of
a
savings
bond
where
you
have
it
payable
to
jane
doe
or
john
doe,
they
certainly
both
have
rights
in
that
bond.
mr.
max
fink
well,
absence
the
community
property
law
and
--
no,
i've
none.
and
it
has
always
been,
i
believe,
general
opinion
certainty
if
congress
in
1909
and
in
earlier
times
when
the
statute
was
enacted
and
reenacted
that
children
always
share
in
the
estate
of
the
intestate.
i
turn
now
to
the
act
of
1831
which
is
the
first
act
that
granted
rights
to
widows
and
children
and
i
note
that
the
1790
act,
which
was
our
first
act,
our
first
--
congress
enacted
an
act
which
gave
to
the
author
the
right
to
have
a
copyright
of
14
years.
and
if
he
was
living
at
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
year,
he
could
renew
for
another
14
years.
1831
is
the
first
time
the
women
and
children
appeared
on
the
scene.
this
act
reads
that
if
1831
act,
that
if
at
the
expiration
of
the
aforesaid
term
of
years,
such
author
be
still
living
or
being
dead
shall
have
left
a
widow
or
child
or
children,
either
or
all
of
them
living,
the
same
exclusive
right
shall
be
continued
to
such
author,
designer,
or
engraver
or
if
dead
then
to
his
widow
and
children
--
widow
and
child
or
children
was
the
word
used
for
the
further
term
of
14
years.
now,
this
act
demonstrates
three
things.
first,
it
is
clear
that
even
in
1831,
congress
did
not
wish
to
prefer
a
spouse
to
the
children,
treated
them
all
alike.
and
we
all
admit
the
1831
statute
very
clearly
demonstrates
then
to
such
widow
and
child
or
children
for
the
further
term
of
14
years
that
they're
all
treated
alike.
this
is
conceded
by
even
in
amicus
curiae.
it
is
clear
that
even
in
1831
then,
that
congress
did
not
prefer
a
widow
over
the
child
or
children.
secondly,
from
this
1831
statute,
we
gather,
that
even
in
1831,
congress
saw
no
insurmountable
problem
regarding
the
percentage
of
how
they
were
going
to
share,
which
was
presented
to
us
here
yesterday
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
max
fink
they
--
they
--
the
provision
merely
provides
that
the
widow
and
child
or
children
take
the
renewal
copyright
and
the
cases
and
the
commentators
on
the
subject
have
indicated
that
this
is
a
tenancy
in
common,
they
share
in
common.
that
was
intended
by
congress
and
that
is
the
law.
mr.
max
fink
in
the
statute
itself,
only
in
the
cases
and
the
comments
of
the
writers.
mr.
max
fink
no
particular
congressional
reference
that
i
have,
your
honor.
mr.
max
fink
now
--
well
except
that
the
act
--
mr.
max
fink
-–
clearly
provides,
your
honor,
if
i
may
suggest
that
if
the
author
be
dead
then
the
renewal
right
goes
to
such
widow
and
child
or
children
and
this
is
a
grant
to
them
jointly.
and
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
problem
on
that
score
that
the
words
are
clear
both
in
that
act
as
well
as
in
all
acts
subsequent
to
that
time
that
the
grant
is
a
joint
grant,
a
joint
right.
another
important
--
mr.
max
fink
well,
of
course,
that
doesn't
concern
us
here
because
the
--
mr.
max
fink
you
see,
only
that
one
child.
mr.
max
fink
but
--
mr.
max
fink
--
in
my
--
it
is
my
view
and
the
view,
i
believe,
of
the
more
eminent
writers
in
this
subject
with
which
i
am
pleased
to
agree
that
the
wife
and
children
share
pro
rata
to
the
number
of
people.
another
important
incident
of
this
act
of
1831
where
the
widow
and
children
were
first
granted
the
right
of
renewal
is
that
we
noticed
that
in
--
even
in
1831,
congress
saw
no
problem
in
the
marketability
of
the
product
of
the
copyright
where
--
and
here
we
have
clearly
that
if
someone
wanted
to
get
the
entire
right
of
the
widow,
and
from
1831
on,
and
the
children
had
to
enter
into
the
grant.
and
may
i,
at
this
time,
suggest
to
your
honor
that
there
has
been
a
clamor
from
the
very
inception
of
copyright
by
legislation
of
the
library
of
congress
meeting
call
prior
to
the
1909
act
by
the
so-called
class
of
assignees,
the
publisher's
studios,
and
so
forth,
who
buy
properties.
they
wanted
a
long
term.
they
wanted
to
acquire
all
of
the
rights.
this
is
going
on
and
the
subject
has
been
studied
time
and
time
again.
and
congress
has
nevertheless,
on
each
occasion,
reenacted
the
split
term
of
copyright
in
order
to
give
that
new
protection
to
the
dependents
of
the
author,
free
and
unfettered
from
agreements,
arrangements
made
prior
to
that
time.
and
frankly,
this
practical
argument
that
they
have
to
go
to
more
than
the
--
just
the
widow
for
renewal
right,
is
a
bit
suspicious
because
in
the
first
place,
in
most
writings,
particularly
music,
there
are
always
several
collaborators.
each
of
them
has
an
undivided
interest.
there
is
always
the
next
of
kin
who
may
be
there
to
pick
up
the
renewal
right
at
the
time
that
it
accrues,
maybe
no
wife
or
no
children.
certainly,
we
don't
know
that
the
wife
is
going
to
survive
28
years.
we
don't
know
who
the
next
of
kin
is
going
to
be,
we'd
only
know
a
wife
the
man's
going
to
be
married
to
at
the
end
of
28
years.
these
problems
are
not
new
and
they're
multitudinous
if
one
sets
out
to
grasp
the
entire
right
that
all
persons
may
ever
have
in
a
particular
copyright,
in
order
to
ensure
themselves
the
continuation
of
56
years
of
undisturbed
possession
of
all
rights
under
the
copyright,
he
would
have
to
contract
with
a
great
number
of
people
including
many
that
could
not
be
known
at
the
earlier
date.
of
course,
under
the
arguments
made,
that
the
copyrights
be
worth
more
in
the
hands
of
the
widow,
she
doesn't
have
to
share
with
the
children.
well
of
course,
this
is
true.
but
we
are
mindful
of
the
--
of
the
language
of
one
of
our
great
justices
who've
said
that
merely
because
something
is
worth
more
in
the
hands
of
one
than
in
the
hands
of
the
other
does
not
mean
that
one
should
lose
his
rights.
in
any
event,
we
come
to
an
adaption
of
the
act
of
1870
following
the
adaption
of
the
act
--
of
the
earlier
act
of
1831
and
adapting
this
act,
this
is
what
the
commissioners
of
revision
stated.
they
said,
if
the
bill
was
examined
by
the
committee,
that's
the
house
committee
on
revisions
of
laws
and
was
found
to
embody
all
the
provisions
of
existing
law
in
brief,
clear
and
precise
language.
we
will
remember
that
the
earlier
act
had
in
it
considerable
language,
it
wasn't
necessary
to
the
task.
and
so
the
1870
act,
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
adapted
the
word
that
the
author,
if
he
be
still
living
or
his
widow
or
children
if
he
be
dead,
shall
have
the
same
exclusive
right
continued
for
the
further
term
of
14
years.
and
this
is
certainly
a
brief,
clear,
and
concise
language.
the
--
in
1909
or
our
present
section
as
it
now
stands
was
so
far
pertinent
here
was
concerned
was
adapted.
there
were
acts
pre
--
there
were
bills
proposed
that
the
widow
take
first
and
the
children
second.
however,
those
bills
were
completely
rejected.
and
the
report
of
the
committee,
the
60th
congress
states
among
other
things
that
instead
of
continuing
the
renew
--
right
of
renewal
to
the
author
if
still
living
or
to
the
widow
or
children
of
the
author
if
he
be
dead,
we
provide
that
the
author
of
such
work
if
still
living
may
apply
for
the
renewal
or
the
widow,
widower
or
children
of
the
author
if
the
author
be
not
living
or
if
such
author,
widow,
widower
or
the
children
be
not
living,
then
the
author's
executors
or
the
absence
of
will
is
next
of
kin
may
apply
for
the
renewal.
in
this
respect,
even
the
1909
act
retained
the
formulation
of
the
preceding
acts
and
that's
the
act
of
which
we
are
confronted
today.
now,
we
want
to
bear
in
mind
that
there
were
--
this
act
of
1909,
the
act
of
1870,
the
reenactments
and
there
were
--
and
reenactments
in
between
and
reenactments
since
and
all
during
this
time,
the
copyright
officer
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
statute
have
continuously
and
constantly
taken
the
clear
position
which
has
been
publicized
to
all
that
the
children
and
the
widow
share
equally
in
the
renewal
rights.
there
are
instructions
for
renewing
applications
so
show
and
this
has
been
their
practice
and
known
to
all.
that
this
is
the
better
practice.
that
this
is
the
appropriate
practice.
that
this
practice
was
publicized.
it's
clearly
indicated
in
the
briefs,
by
respondent's
brief
as
well
as
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
government,
which
shows
that
this
has
been
the
practice
this
many
years.
and
i
am
somewhat
surprised
that
one
would
claim
at
this
late
date
that
this
has
not
been
the
practice.
now,
when
it
comes
to
interpreting
our
statute
which
i
suggest
by
its
four
corners,
evidence
is
that
the
women
and
the
surviving
husbands,
surviving
widowers
and
the
children
all
share
as
a
class.
if
we
interpret
it
in
accordance
with
equity
and
conscience,
i
think
we
must
all
agree
that
a
child
is
as
much
in
need
of
support
as
is
a
widow.
a
child
is
also
a
dependent
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
harlan
holds
the
question
yesterday
as
to
whether
if
a
widow
renews
a
copyright,
she
then
owns
it
all
to
the
exclusion
of
a
child
if
--
if
the
court
interpreted
all
that
way.
and
we
suggest
without
painstaking
that
the
law
is
very
clear
that
if
a
widow
was
permitted
to
renew
to
the
exclusion
of
the
children,
she
would
then
own
the
entire
copyright
and
if
she
died
the
next
day,
it
would
go
to
her
estate
and
whoever
she
may
devise
or
acquitted
once
it
has
been
renewed
or
she
could
give
it
away,
do
whatever
she
may
wish
with
it.
the
child
would
have
no
interest
whatsoever
if
this
court
should
happen
to
rule
as
contended
for
by
petitioner.
now
this,
with
the
--
the
--
there
are
many
text
writers,
article
writers
in
cases
cited
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
briefs
of
the
government
with
regard
to
the
--
the
opinion
and
the
practice
that
the
widow,
widower,
and
children
share.
and
because
mr.
--
because
the
petitioner
yesterday
made
some
reference
to
a
letter
written
by
mr.
ligon
johnson
or
to
mr.
ligon
johnson,
i
should
like
to
read
to
this
court,
if
i
may,
a
letter
from
richard
c.
de
wolf,
acting
register
of
copyright
to
mr.
ligon
johnson
on
april
22,
1944
with
respect
to
the
same
problem
which
he
considers
whether
the
widow,
widower
and
children
share
together.
the
copyright
office
in
this
letter
stated,
“my
own
view
is
that
there
are
--
they
are
members
of
one
class.
consequently,
one
member
of
the
class
may
file
application
for
renewal
and
thereby
obtain
a
legal
title
holding
the
renewal
copyright
in
trust
however
by
the
other
members
of
the
class.
if
would
seem
to
me
that
if
it
had
been
the
intention
to
give
the
widow
a
right
of
renewal
to
the
exclusion
of
the
children,
the
language
of
the
section
would
have
read
that
the
copyright
could
be
renewed
by
the
widow
if
the
author
is
not
living
or
if
neither
author
nor
widow
is
living,
then
by
the
children.
the
tenor
of
the
discussions
in
regard
to
the
renewal
provisions,
as
you
may
recall,
and
here
we
asked
reference
to
discussions
in
congress.
the
tenor
of
discussion
on
the
ground
of
renewal
provision
you
may
recall,
seems
to
emphasize
the
desirability
of
the
authors
being
able
to
provide
for
his
family.
let
us
suppose
that
an
author
has
been
married
two
or
more
times
and
that
children
survived
him
by
an
earlier
marriage,
then,
do
you
think
that
the
loss
would
intend
the
widow,
that
is,
the
person
who
was
his
wife
at
the
time
of
his
death
to
take
the
entire
renewal
copyright
to
the
exclusion
of
the
children?
the
difficulty
in
giving
a
valid
title
to
the
renewal
copyright
under
the
terms
of
the
existing
law
is
obvious
as
is
frequently
been
brought
to
our
attention.
however,
it
would
be
almost
as
great
if
the
question
were
one
of
a
number
of
children
as
it
is
with
the
widow
included
along
with
the
children,
so
also
of
the
next
of
kin
or
indeed
of
several
joint
authors.
petitioners
make
so-called
practical
arguments,
and
they
argue
that
many
deals
fall
through
because
they
can't
clear
rights,
well,
frankly
clearing
rights,
clearing
expectancies
that
may
accrue
at
the
end
of
28
years
has
always
been
a
problem
and
one
which
the
so-called
assignee
class
as
distinguished,
if
i
may
say,
from
the
individual
writer-author
have
always
been
concerned
with.
and
they
have
some
difficulty
in
clearing
them
because
human
affairs
do
change,
marriages
change,
then
they
have
more
children,
more
next
of
kin
at
the
time
the
renewal
right
arises,
and
this
is
multiplied
by
the
number
of
authors
who
contribute
to
a
single
work.that
has
never
really
posed
a
problem.
now
we
suggest
to
your
honor
that
these
matters
outside
the
record
such
as
the
argument
regarding
the
$500,000
deal
lost
by
one
of
the
studios,
i
believe
we
can
say
from
our
own
knowledge
that
these
deals
are
quite
often
lost
for
many
reasons,
most
of
which
are
generally
unknown
and
certainly
the
record
here
is
silent
upon
many
such
deal.
i
believe
that
i
may
say
without
painstaking
that
as
a
practical
matter,
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case
has
demonstrated
that
the
child
receives
$100,000
out
of
performance
royalties
as
--
and
as
a
bonus
more
than
what
have
been
received
by
mr.
and
mrs.
de
sylva.
i
think
i
should
point
out
to
mrs.
de
sylva
probably
granted
her
rights
some
years
ago
was
indicated
by
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
to
some
of
the
publishers.
if
she
had
those
rights
grant
over
again
today,
it
would,
of
course,
be
much
more
valuable.
and
that
was
the
intent
and
purpose
of
congress,
to
protect
those
rights
so
that
when
they
do
become
available,
those
people
who
are
dependent
can
realize
upon
them
fully
and
so
that
they
are
not
fully
disposed
off
before
their
true
value
is
known
and
established.
there
are
a
great
number
of
works
that
have
been
split
in
the
second
period
between
different
publishers,
one,
two
or
more
publishers.
there
is
a
reason
for
it.
there
is
an
economic
reason.
and,
of
course,
although
this
court
can't
decide
this
matter
based
upon
economic
reasons
which
don't
appear,
i
suggest
without
apology
and
in
the
first
place,
there
are
literally
many
thousands
of
copyrights
each
year
particularly
a
case
and
is
for
compositions.
but
older
copyrights
would
become
lost
and
forgotten
were
it
not
for
this
renewal
period
and
the
right
to
go
out
and
renegotiate
and
make
a
new
deal
and
let
somebody
else
--
somebody
new
put
some
money
on
it
and
exploit
it
to
keep
it
available.
secondly,
that
it
is
true
that
over
the
first
28-year
period,
it
may
--
a
publisher
may
become
decadent
for
that
matter
or
retire
from
the
business
and
merely
wait
until
the
public
comes
and
finds
the
article
and
purchase
it
from
him
before
he
is
duly
bound
to
pay
a
royalty.
and
it
is
our
opinion
that
renewal
period
were
realized
more
if
those
who
obtained
the
renewal
are
free
to
deal
with
it
in
their
own
fashion.
we're
cognizant
of
the
fact
this
court
has
ruled
the
fisher
versus
witmark
case
announced
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
author
himself
has
the
right
to
agree
to
assign
his
renewal
if
and
when
he
should
survive
and
acquire
it.
and
i
assume
that
by
the
same
token,
others
could
grant
their
renewal.
i
should
mention
that
decision
--
there
were
some
dissent.
justice
douglas
and
justice
--
justice
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe,
contended
even
there
that
the
author
should
not
be
permitted
to
part
with
--
to
agree
to
part
with
his
renewal
right
if
and
when
he
survived
to
receive
it.
and
it
indicates
the
desire
of
congress
and
the
act
itself
to
at
least
preserve
this
renewal
rights
so
that
when
they
do
accrue,
they
maybe
realized
upon.
it's
true
the
author
may
deal
with
his
renewal
right
only
if
he
lives
and
survives
to
renew
it.
mr.
max
fink
no,
your
honor.
there
hasn't
--
mr.
max
fink
the
opinions
in
that
case
are
not
--
mr.
max
fink
no.
i
--
i
--
mr.
max
fink
i
merely
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
even
in
that
case,
the
renewal
right
was
so
carefully
guarded
for
the
future.
that
even
in
that
case,
it
was
only
decided
that
you
can
agree
to
convey
a
way
to
your
renewal
rights
if
you
survive
to
the
time
when
it
accrues.
and
even
that
was
decided
by
some
difference
of
opinion
in
this
court.we
are
--
i
believe
do
not
intend
to
construe
congress'
intentions
from
that
decision,
your
honor.
now,
i
repeat
again,
if
i
may,
that
the
arguments
that
this
copyright
should
be
free
and
unfettered
and
so
that
the
assignee,
so-called
class
of
assignees
are
free
to
go
out
and
deal
with
them
and
tie
them
for
the
--
for
a
56-year
period
so
that
assignees
would
have
less
people
to
deal
with
when
they
go
out
to
acquire
a
copyright
and
to
ensure
themselves
the
posterity
in
that
copyright.
these
arguments
have
been
made
time
and
time
again.
history
of
all
legislation
on
the
subject
reveals
it
and
congress
has
continuously
rejected
most
of
those
arguments
and
has
enacted
legislation
here
which
clearly
specifies
that,
number
one,
the
right
goes
only
to
those
persons
designated
by
congress.
and
only
in
the
classes
or
classifications
in
which
congress
has
designated.
they
must
survive
and
be
available
to
apply
it
for
the
renewal
at
the
time
it
accrues.
