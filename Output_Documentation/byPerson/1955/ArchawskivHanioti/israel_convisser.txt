mr.
israel
convisser
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
israel
convisser
i
was
retained
to
argue
this
case
only
about
a
week
ago,
and
so
i
must
apologize
to
this
bench
for
the
fact
that
my
research
has
not
been
as
extensive
as
i
should
have
liked
to
have
been.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
propose
to
argue
a
point
not
raised
in
the
brief
and
propose
to
cite
some
cases
not
cited
in
the
brief,
i
respectfully
ask
leave
to
file
the
supplemental
memorandum,
if
i
may.
mr.
israel
convisser
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
should
also
call
the
attention
--
mr.
israel
convisser
that
this
is
an
action
in
tort
which
is
exclusively
a
land
tort
and
basically
outside
the
cognizance
of
admiralty
that
the
rule
in
admiralty
is
that
jurisdiction
of
torts
is
controlled
by
locality
or
situs.
and
that
if
this
is,
in
fact,
an
action
in
tort,
all
of
the
alleged
acts
of
fraud
having
been
committed
upon
the
land,
there
was
no
maritime
situs
to
give
it
admiralty
jurisdiction.
that
point
has
not
been
argued
in
the
brief.
the
brief
has
argued
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
this
case
if
it
be
deemed
to
be
an
action
upon
contract
which
i
think
is
demonstrably
not
so.
but
before
i
touch
that
argument,
i
must
--
mr.
israel
convisser
the
case
came
up
on
very
shortened
transcripts.
it's
about
10
pages
long
but
i
have
looked
at
the
record
of
the
case.
the
libel
is
there.
and
the
libel,
i
submit,
is
clearly
a
libel
in
tort.
and
i
propose
to
demonstrate
that,
if
i
may.
but
before
i
reach
that
point,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
found
a
maze
of
complications
in
this
case
with
many
questions
of
which
they
determined
only
one,
namely,
the
jurisdictional
question,
should
this
court
disagree
with
the
second
circuit?
i
submit
that
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
would
be
to
remand
that
to
afford
the
court
of
appeals
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
other
questions
of
which
there
are
many
in
this
case.
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
but
it's
treated
or
as
though
it
were
a
contract
action
based
upon
fraud.
and
my
position
is
that
the
libel
is
exclusively
a
libel
in
tort.
mr.
israel
convisser
well,
i
must
--
i
must
apologize
and
say
that
i
didn't
try
to
brief.
but
i
think
that
the
--
the
context
of
the
brief
is
such
that
the
argument
went
all
upon
the
theory
that
even
if
this
were
a
contract
based
upon
fraud,
it
would
not
be
cognizable.
now,
i
would
like
to
call
some
facts
--
mr.
israel
convisser
well
i
--
mr.
israel
convisser
yes.
i
wish
to
answer
your
question,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
i
understand.
they
came
up
to
this
court.
parts
of
the
transcripts
are
the
hearings
in
the
baltimore
case
of
todd
against
city
of
athens
which
was
the
foreclosure
of
the
lien
of
the
todd
shipyards
of
a
repair
bill
on
the
ship
that
was
supposed
to
convey
these
passengers.
there
was
also
a
portion
of
the
record
in
the
hearing
held
by
judge
ryan
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
consider
whether
or
not
to
vacate
the
attachment
of
another
vessel
owned
by
the
basil
shipping
company,
and
that
attachment
was
vacated.
now
that
is
the
entire
record
in
this
case.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
record
does
not
support
any
of
the
allegations
of
this
libel.
i
also
--
mr.
israel
convisser
i
presume
that
the
record
that
i
saw
here
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
cannot
answer
your
question
more
categorically.
mr.
israel
convisser
this
transfer,
it
has
the
libel.
it
has
a
copy
of
the
libel.
it
does
not
have
a
copy
of
the
answer.
mr.
israel
convisser
i
believe
sir,
that
it
is
self-evident
than
it
is
--
mr.
israel
convisser
--
and
i
do
so
argue.
mr.
israel
convisser
i
do
so
argue.
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
that
is
correct.
mr.
israel
convisser
that
is
correct,
sir,
unless,
you
wish
to
read
some
of
the
other
questions
in
the
case.
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
libel
--
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
that
is
my
proposition,
sir.
now,
i
have
also
--
i
already
mentioned
--
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that's
in
that
transcript
that
justice
frankfurter
just
pointed
out.
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
i
presume
so,
but
they
did
note,
sir,
that
that
is
presumably
what
the
libelants
intended.
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
not
of
a
tort,
sir?
mr.
israel
convisser
well,
is
it
not
the
remedy
that
is
imposed
by
law
and
does
not
the
law
describe
the
act
out
of
which
the
remedy
arises
either
as
a
contract
or
a
tort?
mr.
israel
convisser
very
well,
sir,
then
i
--
i
must
try
to
--
to
persuade
you
against
your
--
your
judgment
now.
but
in
order
to
--
mr.
israel
convisser
may
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
fact
that
has
not
yet
been
mentioned.
that
the
cooperate
owner
of
the
city
of
athens,
a
hungarian
corporation
by
the
name
of
sociedad
naviera
transaltantica,
was
not
named
as
a
respondent
in
this
libel.
that
the
single
respondent
named
in
this
case
is
basil
hanioti.
he
is
the
only
person
who
was
sued
here.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors,
if
you
read
this
libel
in
connection
with
that
fact,
in
context
with
that
fact,
you
must
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
is
an
action
against
basil
hanioti
for
his
fraud
as
a
result
of
which
the
libelant
sustained
--
that
is,
they
do
not
even
asked
for
damages
for
the
fraud.
if
you
will
read
the
ad
damnum
clause,
they
seek
restitution
as
on
a
recession
of
the
contract
for
fraud.
mr.
israel
convisser
sir,
i
--
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
what
they
alleged
is
that
hanioti
set
up
this
corporation
to
limit
his
liability.
and
that
that
itself
is
not
sufficient
to
create
alter
ego
--
mr.
israel
convisser
well
i'm
sorry,
sir.
then
i
--
i
perhaps,
i
don't
recognize
the
scope
of
my
own
argument.
i
thought
that
this
case
was
here
for
review
of
all
questions.
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
be
happy
to
limit
myself
to
whatever
question
you
think
is
appropriate.
mr.
israel
convisser
sir,
i
--
i
question
whether
no
objection
has
been
raised.
i
don't
have
the
--
i
don't
even
have
the
answer
to
the
libel
here.
mr.
israel
convisser
but
--
mr.
israel
convisser
may
i
say,
sir,
that
so
far
as
i
understand
the
law
of
alter
ego,
it
is
not
sufficient
that
there
be
merely
limitation
of
liability.
there
must
be
something
in
addition
to
that
and
i
think
that
the
cases
so
hold
that
these
libelants
recognized
that
that
was
their
problem,
and
that
seeking
to
hold
basil
hanioti,
who
by
the
way
has
been
subjected
to
an
order
of
arrest
because
of
fraud,
that
in
seeking
to
subject
the
--
this
person,
basil
hanioti,
they
necessarily
have
to
allege
that
he
committed
a
fraud
upon
them
in
order
to
be
able
to
effect
the
piercing
of
the
corporate
there.
the
cases
hold
that
mere
limitation
of
liability
is
not
enough.
there
must
be
something
else
and
i
should
like
to
submit
the
cases
to
your
honors.
mr.
israel
convisser
a
different
situation
might
have
been
presented,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
if
--
mr.
israel
convisser
but
before
any
question
can
be
raised
as
thought
this
were
the
sociedad
naviera.
the
fact
is
justifying
the
piercing
of
the
corporate
veil
must
first
be
--
be
alleged
and
proved.
were
--
were
sociedad
naviera
a
defendant?
perhaps,
it's
still
dubious
in
my
mind
but
i
don't
have
the
time
to
argue.
perhaps,
a
cause
of
action
in
contract
might
be
made
out
against
sociedad
naviera,
and
an
--
as
an
ancillary
to
that,
under
the
swift
case,
it
might
have
been
held
or
alleged
that
basil
hanioti,
by
virtue
of
his
fraudulent
acts,
utilized
the
corporation
as
his
alter
ego
and
therefore
was
responsible.
mr.
israel
convisser
but
they
--
they
have
to
--
they
have
to
make
an
allegation
to
justify
the
piercing
of
a
corporate
veil
and
that
is
where
their
--
their
allegations
of
fraud
come
in.
i
would
like
to
--
to
submit
to
your
honors
this
basic
dilemma
that
i
think
confronted
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
as
i
have
note
--
as
i
have
mentioned
to
you,
the
decree
of
the
district
court
provided
for
an
order
of
arrest,
this
was
pursuant
to
the
civil
practice
act
of
new
york.
their
dilemma,
however,
was
this,
that
if
they
brought
the
action
for
breach
of
contract
in
this
case,
they
will
not
entitle
to
an
order
of
arrest
under
the
new
york
civil
practice
act.
the
case
of
novotny
against
kosloff,
decided
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
214,
new
york
12
so
held
and
the
court
actually
said,
“a
liability
to
responding
damages
for
a
nonperformance
of
the
contract
in
refusing
to
carry
it
out.”
in
this
case,
for
discharging
the
plaintiff
in
violation
of
its
terms,
it
cannot
be
said
to
be
incurred
until
the
breach
is
actually
committed,
and
is
unrelated
to
the
fraud
in
the
making
of
the
contract.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
the
civil
practice
act
provides
for
an
order
of
arrest
for
an
action
in
fraud.
but
in
that
case,
they
are
impelled
upon
the
other
one
of
the
dilemma
because
an
action
in
fraud,
a
land
tort
is
not
cognizable
in
admiralty.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
you
must
read
the
libel
with
this
in
mind.
this
is
the
dilemma
that
confronted
the
risk
for
the
petitioners.
this
is
the
dilemma
that
they
had
to
solve.
and
if
--
if
you
hold
that
this
was
an
action
for
breach
of
contract
cognizable
in
admiralty,
which
i
respectfully
submit
would
not
be
warranted,
then
it
seems
to
me
this
case
should
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
whether
there
was
warrant
for
issuing
the
order
of
arrest.
if
on
the
other
hand,
you
read
the
libel
as
i
submit
it
must
be
read
as
one
stating
a
cause
of
action
in
tort
against
an
individual
with
whom
there
was
no
contractual
liability
alleged
or
proved
except
on
the
basis
of
the
theory
of
alter
ego,
then
you
have
a
case
clearly
sounding
in
fraud
which
is
a
land
tort.
i
have
jumped
into
my
argument
because
of
the
questions
that
were
raised,
but
i
wish
to
submit
to
the
court
some
of
the
facts
that
i
have
gleaned
from
the
record
in
this
court.
the
city
of
athens
was
purchased
by
this
hungarian
corporation
for
$430,000.
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
that
ship
was
held
free
and
clear
of
any
lien
or
mortgage,
however,
substantial
repairs
and
under
--
and
alterations
were
undertaken
of
this
vessel
and
were
performed
by
the
todd
shipyard
corporation.
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
expected,
that
the
bill
would
run
anywhere
from
$80,000
to
$200,000.
the
total
repair
bill,
and
there
was
a
second
repair
necessitated
by
heavy
weather
damage,
ran
to
close
to
$750,000.
nevertheless,
the
city
of
athens
had
completed
four
roundtrip
voyages.
the
sail
of
the
city
of
athens,
a
forced
sail,
brought
$400,000.
now,
these
libelants
intervened
in
the
proceedings
in
baltimore
in
order
to
assert
a
lien
for
their
passage
money
and
they
were
represented
by
their
present
counsel.
they
asserted
that
that
money
was
used
for
the
purchase
of
supplies,
for
the
payment
of
the
crew,
and
for
the
payment
of
part
of
the
todd
shipyards
bill.
and
indeed,
the
record
shows
that
$270,000
were
paid
to
todd
shipyards.
the
commissioner
who
heard
the
evidence
made
this
finding.
he
said
a
shipowner
must
necessarily
secure
funds
from
freight
or
passengers,
and
if
it
purchases
supplies
for
its
vessels
or
has
them
repaired,
it
is
only
from
such
funds
unless
it
borrows
the
money
on
its
personal
credit
or
that
of
the
vessel,
that
such
purchases
are
--
or
repairs
can
be
paid
for.
from
the
record
here,
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
passage
moneys
were
so
employed
resulting
in
certain
liens
being
reduced
or
paid
off.
mr.
israel
convisser
it
is
not
in
the
transcript
but
the
record
is
here.
i
examined
the
record
here.
if
you
wish
the
page
citation,
sir,
this
that
i
read
to
you
is
from
the
hearings
before
the
commissioner,
page
71
of
the
record
in
the
case
of
todd
against
the
city
of
athens.
a
transcript
of
some
of
the
testimony
is
here
in
this
court,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
if
i
--
if
you
wish.
mr.
israel
convisser
very
--
very
well,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
oh,
yes.
that
--
before
i
get
to
that,
there
is
one
further
point
that
i
wish
to
make.
the
passage
tickets
in
this
case
were
purchased
according
to
the
record
on
file
here
from
the
months
of
february
until
july.
between
february
and
july,
at
least
two
and
possibly
three
roundtrip
voyages
were
made
by
the
vessel.
the
ship
was
libeled
on
january
--
on
july
15,
i
believe.
only
five
tickets
were
sold
after
that
date
and
since
tickets
were
being
sold
all
over
the
united
states
and
europe,
it
may
reasonably
be
assumed,
i
submit,
that
this
was
simply
because
of
the
difficulty
in
time
of
getting
it
known
that
the
voyages
would
have
to
be
canceled.
i
think
from
this,
it
is
difficult
to
assume
that
there
was
any
fraud
here.
the
district
court
rounded
its
decision
on
the
insolvency
of
the
corporate
owner
of
the
vessel.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
it
actually
was
insolvent,
you
had
a
ship
for
which
$430,000
was
paid.
surely,
it
was
worth
more
than
that
after
the
expense
of
repairs
and
alterations.
what
was
the
value
of
that
ship?
no
evidence
of
what
money
there
was
in
the
treasury
of
the
corporation.
the
fact
--
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
sir,
if
i
understand
the
question,
the
core
of
the
problem
is
whether
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
israel
convisser
sir,
i
do
not
deny
--
mr.
israel
convisser
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
one
further
thing
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
fraud
and
then
i
shall
go
to
the
question
--
the
other
question.
i
respectfully
submit
that
if
you
read
this
libel
and
script
from
it
the
allegations
of
fraud,
it
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
against
anyone.
and
if
i
am
given
leave
to
submit
a
--
a
supplemental
memorandum,
i
think
that
perhaps
i
can
satisfy
the
court
of
the
points
that
i
have
made
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
considering
this
to
be
a
case
in
fraud
that
is
in
tort.
now,
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
this,
as
an
action
in
contract,
is
cognizable
in
admiralty.
the
bryer
case
which
is
relied
upon
rather
heavily
by
the
petitioners
was
one
in
which
there
have
been
a
union
of
ship
and
cargo.
the
failure
of
the
ship
to
carry
the
goods
gave
the
case
a
maritime
situs.
and
in
that
sense,
it
is
not
analogous
to
this
case
where
there
was
no
union
of
ship
and
cargo
or
ship
and
passengers.
the
only
other
real
case
on
which
the
petitioners
rely
is
the
case
of
swift
against
compania
columbiana
which
is
cited
both
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
in
respondent's
brief.
in
that
case,
this
court
pointed
out
that
fraud
is
not
the
business
of
admiralty.
and
i
presume
that
they
were
there
talking
about
fraud
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
in
tort
or
in
contract.
however,
the
court
said
that
that
would
not
prevent
admiralty
from
protecting
its
jurisdiction
once
it
have
it.
but
i
submit
that
before
there
was
any
jurisdiction
for
admiralty
to
protect,
it
must
first
acquire
it.
now,
in
the
swift
case,
what
happened
was
that
a
libel
was
filed
for
the
cargo
damage
arising
out
of
negligence
of
a
ship
that
was
presumably
wrecked.
the
libel
was
filed
against
the
corporate
owner
of
the
vessel
and
an
attachment
was
asked
against
another
vessel
that
it
owned.
the
next
day,
a
supplemental
and
demanded
libel
was
filed
alleging
that
the
corporation
had
transferred
the
vessel
to
a
dummy
corporation
that
it
had
set
up
for
that
purpose.
the
court
held
that
having
had
jurisdiction
of
the
original
libel
as
it
clearly
did,
it
could
protect
its
jurisdiction
even
with
respect
to
the
allegations
of
fraud.
now,
the
--
the
case
of
silva
versus
the
finance
company,
and
united
transportation
both
decided
in
the
second
circuit,
i
submit,
are
sound
law
today.
as
this
court
has
sometimes
noted,
decisions
are
sometimes
made
in
general
terms.
but
in
those
cases,
the
quasi
contracts
which
they
said
were
not
cognizable
in
admiralty
arose
in
the
case
of
united
transportation
out
of
a
fraud
because
of
the
common
officer
of
the
two
corporations
who
put
through
this
contract.
and
in
the
silva
case,
because
it
was
an
action
against
a
person
who
was
not
a
party
to
the
maritime
contract,
namely,
the
finance
company.
before
my
time
expires,
i
wish
to
address
myself
to
one
question
and
that
is
the
appealability
of
the
orders.
a
decree
was
entered
on
december
6th.
on
december
7th,
a
motion
was
made
to
vacate
the
default.
the
moving
party
urged
not
only
that
the
default
was
not
willful,
but
also
that
the
warrant
of
attachment
was
not
authorized.
the
court
so
treated
the
motion
because
in
the
opinion,
which
is
in
the
transcript,
he
addressed
himself
to
the
propriety
of
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
of
attachment.
and
so
as
i
submit
that
a
motion
to
modify
a
judgment
as
this
in
effect
was
at
least
involved
is
a
rule
under
50
--
is
within
rule
59
(e)
which
timely
filed
as
this
one
was,
told
the
time
within
which
the
statute
of
--
the
--
the
time
to
appeal
starts
to
run.
and
rule
73
so
holds.
i
think
it's
rule
73
which
says
that
a
rule
made
under
section
--
rule
59
--
stops
the
time
running.
in
any
event,
there
were
two
other
motions
--
two
other
appeals
filed
from
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
vacate
the
default,
they
were
timely
made,
they
were
appealable
orders
and
the
case
was
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
once
surely
a
court
can
decide
the
jurisdictional
question
at
any
time.
besides,
i
regret
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
argue
this
thing
more
extensively,
may
i
have
leave
to
file
a
supplemental
memorandum.
mr.
israel
convisser
yes,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
may
i
have
it
typed
or
(voice
overlap)
mr.
israel
convisser
(inaudible)
i
desire
--
one
way,
i
desire
in
the
(inaudible)
question
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter?
mr.
israel
convisser
and
that
is
respect
--
with
respect
to
the
proofs
as
introduced
in
this
case
on
trial
in
the
southern
district.
we
had
intervened
that
the
interim
action
in
baltimore
back
in
1947
and
hoped
and
tried
to
establish
a
maritime
lien.
since
our
contracts
were
all
executory,
the
decisions
were
that
we
had
no
maritime
lien.
but
at
that
time,
annuity
was
lowered
back
from
france
where
he
had
fled.
and
he
appeared
before
the
district
court,
a
man
on
his
own,
and
said
he's
going
to
tell
the
court
the
truth.
he
testified
before
a
commissioner,
missed
to
put
questions
to
him.
he
admitted
under
oath
that
these
corporations
were
simply
paper
corporation's
dummies.
he
controlled
them
all,
it's
in
the
record
--
it's
in
the
record
on
file
on
this
court.
it's
libellant's
exhibit
2.
and
that
testimony,
under
oath
in
the
baltimore
district
court
was
introduced
in
evidence
in
southern
district.
and
i
think
that
answers
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
on
the
evidence
and
judge
walsh
went
through
the
evidence
very
carefully
and
so
that
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
in
rem
proceeding
and
their
decisions
have
been
(inaudible)
substantially
the
same.
mr.
israel
convisser
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
it's
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
israel
convisser
(inaudible)
your
honor.
mr.
israel
convisser
it's
the
district
court
decision
is
under
the
name
of
acker
and
others
against
the
city
of
athens,
1
--
no,
i'm
sorry,
that's
the
court
--
circuit
court,
177
f.2d,
961.
the
district
court
decision
is
under
the
name
of
todd
shipyards
against
the
city
of
athens,
83
f.supp.67
and
judge
chestnut
went
into
a
--
quite
extensively
wrote
quite
a
length
of
the
opinion
and
he
held
there
that
these
passengers'
claims
were
clearly
within
admiralty.
but
unfortunately,
they
were
enforceable
in
rem
because
the
passengers
never
set
for
the
board
to
ship,
they
got
to
new
york
and
he
didn't
bring
the
ship
to
new
york.
todd
hit
it
and
that
was
it.
mr.
israel
convisser
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
israel
convisser
he
found
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
he
found
it
on
--
and
he
owns
his
own
admission
of
his
own
testimony.
he
asked
the
--
commissioner
asked
the
question,
“do
you
mean
to
tell
me
these
were
nothing
but
paper
corporations?"
and
these
were
practically
his
words.
“yes,
sir,
i
control
them
all.”
