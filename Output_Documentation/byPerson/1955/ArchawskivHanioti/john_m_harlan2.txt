can
you
give
one
second
to
your
argument
if
the
deal
was
too
late?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
raise
your
broader
point
to
point
for
a
degree,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
argue
on
page
48
that
the
government
of
the
libelous
fraud
that's
--
not
a
french
fraud
that's
real
fraud.

(inaudible)
first
page.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
substance
was
to
say,
â€œwell,
maybe
you
could
read
this
as
a
tort
but
will
construe
the
--
the
plaintiff
most
favorably
to
sustain
the
cause
of
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
let
me
say
that,
as
if
the
libel
is
here
to
stating
having
dealt
with
it
as
a
suit,
a
quasi
contract
they
--
then
the
judge
ends
up
and
says
that
the
libel
in
view
to
stating
some
sort
of
a
claim
based
upon
tortuous
conduct
in
the
nature
of
fraud.
it
seems
to
have
been
the
intent
of
the
pleader
in
a
case
against
(inaudible)
jurisdiction
even
clearer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
any
of
this
--
in
this
record
before
us?
