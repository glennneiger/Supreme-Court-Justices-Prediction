mr.
harry
d.
graham
if
it
please
the
court.
well,
this
is
--
may
i
start
your
honor?
mr.
harry
d.
graham
yes,
you
may
proceed.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
now,
this
is
an
admiralty
action
involving
some
350
odd
passengers
who,
back
in
1947,
prepaid
passage
fares
for
voyages
on
board
a
honduran
flagship
known
as
the
city
of
athens,
to
various
ports
in
europe.
they
had
prepaid
their
fares
for
someone
as
prior
to
july
of
1947
and
the
voyage
as
to
which
they
had
prepaid
their
fares
were
to
commence
with
the
voyage
on
july
the
17th
and
thereafter.
the
respondent,
on
the
appointed
date,
did
not
provide
the
vessel
to
carry
these
passengers.
the
vessel
having
been
liable
by
a
statutory
creditor
or
lienor,
and
he
was,
therefore
--
he
therefore
default
and
then
providing
the
transportation
for
these
passengers,
and
these
passengers
sued
in
admiralty
for
the
recovery
of
the
prepaid
fares
which
they
had
paid,
which
they
received
no
transportation.
they
received
the
decree
in
the
district
court
through
southern
district
of
new
york
and
they
extended
their
respective
fares
which
they
paid
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
decree
of
the
district
court
holding
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
causes
of
action
for
these
passengers
was
not
within
admiralty.
and
because
(inaudible)
comes
to
this
court
on
writ
--
writ
of
certiorari
granted
on
october
the
24th,
1955,
the
questions
involved
are
whether
admiralty
has
jurisdiction
of
action
seeking
recovery
of
prepaid
passage
moneys
paid
as
consideration
on
the
maritime
contracts
of
transportation?
which
maritime
contracts
have
breached
by
nonperformance?
the
second
question
is
whether
the
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
in
admiralty,
after
the
proofs
are
in,
is
controlled
by
allocations
of
the
libel
or
by
the
proofs
as
reconciled
to
the
libel,
in
other
words,
the
scope
of
review
in
a
court
of
appeals.
and
the
third
question
involved
is
whether
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
actually
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
court
decree.
the
facts,
as
found
by
the
district
court,
comes
to
this
court
undisturbed
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
the
libel,
the
libelants
alleged
subordinate
allocation
showing
fraud
upon
the
part
of
the
respondent
such
as
absconding,
concealing
himself,
making
himself
judgment
proof
during
the
time
endeavoring
to
procure
jurisdiction
over
him
to
pursue
their
causes
of
action.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
causes
of
action
for
these
passengers
was
simply
the
old
common
law,
form
of
indebitatus
assumpsit,
money
having
received
in
which
admiralty
had
no
jurisdiction.
our
contention
is
that
admiralty
does
have
jurisdiction.
the
jurisdiction
is
conferred
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
article
3
section
2,
conferring
judicial
power
in
the
federal
courts
to
all
cases
of
admiralty
in
maritime
jurisdiction.
now,
the
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts,
some
few
years
shortly
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
was
a
subject
for
congress.
and
congress,
in
1789,
rendered
a
legislative
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
article
3
of
the
constitution
and
the
scope
of
jurisdiction.
in
1848,
this
court
rendered
its
first
decision
wherein
it
covered
the
jurisdiction
of
admiralty
over
contract
actions
which
prior
to
that
--
prior
to
1848,
apparently
had
not
existed.
in
that
particular
case,
the
new
jersey
steam
navigation
against
merchants'
bank,
now
this
court
held
that
it's
the
subject
matter
of
the
contract
which
determines
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
and
once
the
admiralty
has
jurisdiction
of
the
contract,
the
jurisdiction
may
not
be
confined
to
any
one
particular
remedy
on
the
contract,
but
all
remedies
are
--
are
available.
but
the
question
then
now
as
it's
(inaudible)
down
here,
whether
or
not,
because
these
petitioners
brought
their
actions
on
admiralty,
the
remedies
are
less
than
they
would
have,
had
they
pursued
them
at
common
law
if
they
were
able
to
pursue
them
in
a
common
lower
court.
now,
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
that
freight
is
to
consideration
for
the
use
of
vessels.
and
that
it
applies
also
to
the
consideration
paid
by
passengers
for
their
transportation.
now,
whether
the
transportation
be
for
cargo,
for
cadavers,
or
for
human
beings,
the
consideration
is
freight.
and
that
the
--
the
term
"freight"
is
one
which
is
always
been
within
the
jurisdiction
of
admiralty
and
the
shipowner,
for
many
years,
has
always
been
able
to
sue
an
admiralty
to
recover
freight
which
he
has
earned
for
the
performance
of
the
contract
of
maritime
transportation.
there
had
never
been
any
question
about
that.
now,
the
situation
in
this
particular
case
is
that
the
passengers
prepaid
the
freight
and
they
received
no
transportation.
it
was
our
contention
that,
under
the
doctrine
of
equality,
under
the
law
or
equal
application
of
the
law
and
plain
common
sense,
that
if
the
shipowner
could
sue
a
shipper
or
a
passenger
for
the
consideration
due
to
him
for
contract
of
transportation,
that
passenger
has
reciprocal
right
to
sue
the
shipowner
in
admiralty
to
recover
the
earnings
of
prepaid
freights,
which
is
what
they
did
in
this
particular
case.
now,
there
are
not
many
cases
involving
passengers
in
the
law
reports.
but
those
cases
which
are
on
the
law
reports
hold
that
passing
these
actions
for
recovery
of
prepaid
freights
are
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
a
hundred
years
ago,
the
second
circuit
held
in
(inaudible)
that
the
moneys
having
received
pursuant
to
a
contract
for
passenger
transportation
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
admiralty
that
the
duties,
the
implied
duties
annexed
to
a
marine
contract
of
carriers
just
as
maritime
as
to
contract
itself.
and
that
the
implied
duty
to
refund,
money
having
received
to
which
the
shipowner
having
earned
was
just
as
maritime
passed
the
contract.
now,
during
the
tendency
of
this
cause
before
this
court
on
the
writ,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
rendered
the
decision
which
i
have
arranged
with
the
clerk
to
provide
to
the
court
on
february
the
24th,
1956,
which,
in
effect,
repudiates
the
authorities
upon
which
that
same
court
had
reversed
the
decree
in
this
particular
case,
the
archawski
case.
the
decision
on
reargument,
dated
february
the
24th,
1956,
virtually
adapts
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
in
this
particular
case.
and
it
clarifies
its
previous
original
decision
of
december,
1955,
which
had
not
yet
been
reported
at
the
time
of
the
briefs
in
behalf
of
the
petitions
were
filed
in
this
court.
now,
this
court
has
stated
back
around
1933
in
krauss
against
dimon
lumber
ship
company,
that
admiralty
is
not
concerned
with
the
form.
admiralty
is
concerned
only
with
the
subject
matter.
and
it
is
--
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again
that
when
a
case
is
up
for
review,
the
reviewing
court
must
take
the
whole
record
before
end
and
reconcile
the
facts
to
the
pleadings
to
do
justice
where
justices
do.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
they
cited
two
of
their
own
precedents,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
one,
is
a
question
--
is
a
question
of
whether
or
not
these
passenger's
actions
are
in
quasi
contract.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
assume
they
are?
mr.
harry
d.
graham
well
that
was
the
very
subject
the
chief
clark
left
with
your
honor
and
--
mr.
harry
d.
graham
he
apparently
doesn't
know
the
history.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
the
earlier
cases
were
the
two
cases
that
this
court
itself
had
cited.
it's
on
two
--
two
opinions.
silva
against
bankers
commercial
and
the
--
mr.
harry
d.
graham
yes.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
the
passengers
on
the
cobb
case,
there
had
been
a
breach
of
the
contract
of
carriage.
and
the
passengers
in
the
cobb
case
were
suing
for
the
considerations
which
they
had
paid
for
the
contract
of
carriage.
and
the
court
there
labeled
them
as
money
haven't
received.
and
they
held
--
mr.
harry
d.
graham
well,
they
held
that
that
was
an
implied
agreement
annexed
to
the
contract
of
transportation.
and
that
where
a
contract,
by
implication
arises,
it
acquires
the
same
cloak
as
the
original
contract.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
well,
on
that
--
on
that
particular
question,
your
honor,
i
cannot
answer
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
court
of
appeals.
a
similar
situation
to
the
case
that
bars
the
henry
w.
breyer
which
arose
down
in
the
fourth
circuit,
and
then
which
the
shipowner
at
the
time
he
was
soliciting
the
freights
or
the
cargos
was
insolvent.
and
the
only
reason
the
vessel
did
not
break
ground
was
because
of
insolvency.
there,
the
court
held
that
the
breach
of
contract
was
not
only
cognizable
and
the
admiralty
is
a
breach
of
contract
but
it
was
also
a
maritime
tort.
and
that
constructively,
the
shipowner
was
guilty
of
fraud
and
it
was
within
the
admiralty
of
jurisdiction
and
the
--
they
permitted
the
shippers
to
recover
their
prepaid
unearned
freights.
now,
the
server
on
the
united
transport
and
company
cases
cited
by
the
second
circuit
when
they
reversed
the
archawski
case
are
not
even
apposite
particularly
a
case
at
--
at
bar.
in
the
silva
case,
the
shipowner
had
extended
himself
and
had
a
mortgage
on
the
vessel
and
he
was
assigning
the
unearned
freight
moneys
as
they
came
in
to
the
mortgagee.
the
mortgagee
collected
them
with
the
knowledge
that
they
were
not
earned.
the
shippers
did
not
sue
the
shipowner,
they
sued
the
mortgagee
directly
which
is
distinguished
in
this
particular
case
to
case
before
the
bench.
and
there
--
mr.
harry
d.
graham
that
was
the
silva
case,
your
honor.
and
then
the
--
the
allocation
lied
upon
by
the
circuit
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
which
is
by
judge
learned
hand,
united
transportation
and
lighterage
company
against
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad.
the
libelant
and
the
proctor
are
--
the
respondent,
both
corporations
had
a
common
officer
amongst
them
or
between
them,
and
there
had
been
some
fraud
on
the
part
of
this
common
officer.
and
each
of
the
corporations
were
suing
the
other
in
admiralty
and
they
endeavored
to
set
up
what
purported
to
be
a
cross
libel
for
a
contract
entered
into
by
this
officer
on
the
ground
of
fraud.
and
this
contract
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
contract
that
was
on
before
the
court
which
is
entirely
distinct
in
the
situation
that
we're
confronted
with
here
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
very
simple
proposition
here
in
this
case,
and
it
brings
itself
right
down
to
this,
that
if
a
shipowner
can
sue
a
shipper
or
a
passenger
for
the
transportation
which
he
assigned
by
performing
the
contract,
then
on
the
reciprocity,
or
under
equal
application
of
the
law,
the
passenger
should
have
the
same
right
and
same
relief
to
sue
the
shipowner
for
the
prepaid
earning
passage
moneys.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
i
--
i
rest
on
the
krauss
case,
you
honor.
i
think
the
krauss
case
clarifies
the
manner
and
i
also
rest
upon
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
this
recent
decision
which
they
have
practically
repudiated
their
other
decisions.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
it
was
dicta,
your
honor.
in
the
krauss
case,
it
appeared
to
be
dicta.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
it
appeared
to
be
dicta
in
the
krauss
case.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
i
see
no
distinction
whatsoever.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
the
question
before
the
court
in
krauss
case
was
whether
or
not,
the
libelant
could
enforce
his
claim
for
this
overpayment
in
rem.
that
was
the
question
before
the
court.
but
during
the
argument,
counsel
for
the
respondent
first
raised
the
argument.
he
said,
"this
court
is
without
jurisdiction.
the
cause
of
action
for
money
had
been
received."
and
because
he
raised
it
from
--
my
reading
in
the
case
because
he
raised
it,
mr.
justice
stone
commented
upon
it.
and
he
said
it
was
immaterial
in
the
form
of
the
action
--
mr.
harry
d.
graham
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
d.
graham
oh
i'm
sorry.
yes,
sir.
the
notice
of
appeal
in
the
final
decree
was
filed
108
days
filing
the
entry
of
the
final
decree.
and
there
was
no
leave
of
the
court
below
extending
the
time
within
which
to
appeal
procured
by
the
respondent.
we
contend
that
an
appeal
is
not
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
it
is
a
statutory
right
and
compliance
with
the
statute
must
be
met.
in
admiralty,
a
respondent
has
90
days
within
which
to
take
an
appeal.
we're
not
concerned
with
the
common
law
or
the
civil
rules
that
were
stated
here,
we're
concerned
with
admiralty
where
they
have
three
times
to
figure
this
within
which
to
appeal.
and
we
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
decree
of
the
district
court.
and
respectfully
request
that
the
circuit
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
be
reversed
and
the
instruction
be
--
we
happen
to
give
in
to
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
reinstate
its
final
decree.
