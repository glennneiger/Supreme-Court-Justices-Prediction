justice

frankfurter
what
was
the
theory
--
what
was
the
theory
of
decisions
told
here?
what
was
the
theory
of
the
cases
which
reflected
or
which
took
the
line
of
this
decision,
namely,
quasi
contractual
recovery
though
it's
really
a
form
of
--
of
remedy
under
a
--
existing
contract
--
repudiated
contract
or
a
frustrated
contract
is
outside
of
the
admiralty
committee.
what
was
the
theory?
how
did
they
get
that
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
know
but
why
do
i
want
know
way
back
that
sends
their
precedence.
what
is
the
--
what's
the
source
of
--
what
seems
to
me
a
staged
briefly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
assume
they
are
--
assume
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
law
of
recovery
if
the
contract
is
frustrated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
know
that
--
there
must
have
been
something
as
i
can
go
very
objective
to
that
inclusion,
what
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
tell
me
--
you
said
a
little
while
ago
the
play
back
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
did
they
get
off
and
what
do
regard
as
the
right
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
can't
be
--
it's
common
law
--
on
a
contract
(inaudible)
as
something,
that
was
a
technical
common
law
action
on
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
i
want
to
know
is
well,
what
lead
the
court
to
disregard
in
event
that
the
--
i
did
a
content
in
order
find
out
the
source
of
error
and
error
received.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
rest
on
the
krauss
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
rest
down
the
krauss
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
judge
hand
said
that
they
--
they
did
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
of
the
very
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
saying
the
contract
imply
the
facts
that
they
shouldn't
overcharge
and
say
the
contract
implies
with
the
fact
that
if
you
don't
get
any
report,
you
stay
back
for
the
considerations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
--
i
don't
see
why
it's
particularly
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
didn't
have
the
cause
of
action,
he
wouldn't
have
a
lien
to
being
derived
from
the
cause
of
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
before
you
move
on,
may
i
ask,
what
is
a
form
that
we
can
look
to?
what
--
what
is
the
record?
is
there
anything
else
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
arguing
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
may
i
ask
(inaudible)
more
should
the
decree
on
page
12
was
entered
upon
all
trial
proceedings
seeking
for
proof.
now
--
now
that
enumeration
of
equal
materials
were
all
trial
proceedings
and
pleadings
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
--
is
the
libel
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you,
am
i
right
in
suggesting
that
you
must
argue
from
the
libel,
the
libel
in
the
libel
or
as
for
a
tort.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
the
remotest
idea
where
it's
so
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
on
the
basis
of
what
--
to
what
i
must
address
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
say
that
this
libel
on
the
face
show
that
it
is
a
fraud
action
(inaudible)
all
i
have
to
do
is
read
the
libel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
have
to
bother
by
anything
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
on
which
point
as
whether
what
is
--
what
the
cause
of
action
is
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
statement
in
the
(inaudible)
of
the
libel,
i
will
throw
this
out
of
being
a
libel
for
land
cause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
--
i
should
think
by
that,
then
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
blow
away
paragraph
6
of
the
libel.
anything
of
that
remains
on
the
face
of
it,
i
don't
have
to
travel
outside
of
that.
it's
a
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
an
obligation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
they
say
an
obligation
that
--
the
tort
is
an
obligation
imposed
by
law
whereas
an
undertaking
by
a
person
is
an
obligation
(inaudible)
to
which
the
law
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
i
--
if
i
can
construe
it
one
way
or
the
other
and
(inaudible)
say
that
everybody
could
complete
the
cause
of
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
why
do
--
do
you
have
to
try
to
establish
that
a
pleading,
even
assuming
its
ambiguous
phrase
which
heretofore
by
all
the
parties
and
by
all
the
courts
as
indeed
a
controversy
arising
out
of
an
agreement
can't
be
construed
there's
a
controversy
arising
out
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
also
mentioned
it
on
the
argument
and
was
not
reasonable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
isn't
--
well,
this
is
the
place
to
argue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
for
myself
to
suggest
the
libel
which
charges
that
the
named
libelee
is
an
alter
ego
for
somebody
not
sued
and
no
adjudication
is
made
on
that,
no
contest
is
made
in
reference
to
that,
i
should
think
it
really
late
in
the
game
at
the
third
and
the
second
appellate
review
to
open
up
questions
which
might
properly
be
opened
up
and
not
just
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
had
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
therefore,
we
restrict
it
within
the
scope
of
review.
this
is
not
an
(inaudible)
of
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
argue
the
question
on
which
they
presumably
the
case
was
essentially
voir
dire?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
ask
or
wish
on
this
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
argue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
suppose
everything
you're
saying
so
--
suppose
everything
you're
saying
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
deal
with
the
core
of
a
problem
that
money
was
paid
for
a
trip
and
they
didn't
get
the
trip.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
what
i'm
saying
--
but
you're
now
saying
that
there
was
or
wasn't
a
fraud
at
a
different
offense.
certainly,
the
core
of
the
problem
is
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
fraud,
it
doesn't
mean
if
a
fellow
pays
--
pays
in
advance
or
passing
them
on
in
advance
is
for
any
reason,
the
best
reasons
in
the
world.
the
ship
doesn't
go,
the
money
has
to
be
restored.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
that
was
fraud
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
their
decisions
on
the
question
whether
these
were
--
these
were
screened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
were
very
precious
appearances
and
not
reality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
was
decided
by
the
court
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
their
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
it
(inaudible)
you
say
that
the
issue
where
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
has
been
actually
adjudicated
in
the
fourth
circuit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
the
matter
which
you
suggested
to
judge
walsh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
passed
on
it.
