mr.
john
r.
benney
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
district
court
did
carry
out
the
mandate
of
this
court,
it
is
previously
here.
and
that
the
district
court
did
have
before
it
judge
goodman
on
the
hearing
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
the
contact
here
were
harmless.
in
this
court's
prior
opinion,
it
stated
and
i
believe
we
have
it
in
our
brief
at
page
--
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
24,
it
announced
the
rule
that
any
private
communication,
contact
or
tampering
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
jury
man
during
a
trial
about
the
case
was
being
presumptively
injurious
or
prejudicial.
but
that
that
presumption
was
not
conclusive
and
it
could
be
overcome
by
evidence,
as
i
understand
this
court's
decision.
but
the
burden
is
heavily
on
the
government
to
do
that
and
we
say
the
government
has
met
that
burden
in
this
case.
there
was
a
hearing
of
about
three
days,
i
believe.
the
government
presented
the
testimony
of
26
witnesses,
everyone
who
could
possibly
have
any
knowledge
of
the
affair.
the
judge
was
not
very
scrupulous
in
following
the
rules
of
evidence
and
he
let
in
most
everything
that
came
on.
he
gave
the
petitioner
ample
opportunity
to
cross-examine
and
the
petitioner
did
make
a
searching
--
conduct
searching,
cross-examination,
the
government's
principal
witness.
now,
we
say
that
evidence
was
sufficient
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
prejudice
that
the
trial
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
any
manner
in
finding
petitioner
was
not
harmed
by
these
incidents.
now,
petitioner's
counsel
adverts
to
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
seem
to
narrow
this
court's
opinion
down
to
the
f.b.i.
investigation
where
he
let
in
all
of
the
evidence
on
the
contact
with
the
juror
and
as
i
see
his
decision,
it
decides
it
on
all
questions.
now,
it's
true
that
mr.
satterly
contacted
juror
smith
in
this
case
during
the
trial.
that
is,
he
came
to
his
house.
he
had
legitimate
business
for
coming
to
his
house
and
this
juror
smith
was
an
insurance
broker
and
real
estate
broker
and
mr.
satterly
had
have
some
insurance
business
with
him
and
he
had
--
he
didn't
come
under
a
protest.
he
came
there
for
business
reasons
and
while
he
was
there
he
made
this
statement,
"i
know
bones
remmer
very
well.
he
sold
cal-neva
club
for
850,000
on
top
of
the
table
but
he
--
he
got
$350,000
under
the
table,
has
about
$300,000
that
he
doesn't
--
i
believe
the
printer
apparently
didn't
like
the
word
"daresn't"
so
he
--
he
corrected
it,
"doesn't
touch.
why
don't
you
make
a
deal
with
bones."
now,
those
are
the
words
he
said.
and
mr.
smith,
as
the
court
found,
was
a
very
upright
and
conscientious
jury
man.
that
statement
bothered
him
a
little.
and
he
said
in
his
testimony
that
he
didn't
consider
it
a
serious
joke
in
his
own
mind
at
that
time,
but
that
he
--
that
satterly
was
accustomed
to
joking
with
him,
bantering
and
playing
jokes
and
hunting
and
shooting
his
--
someone
who
testified
here
that
he
was
shooting
the
other
man
--
mr.
smith
decoys
when
he's
hunting.
he
said
--
what
bothered
him
was
the
trial
judge's
instructions.
every
act
--
before
every
recess,
the
trial
judge
admonish
the
jurors
to
be
careful
about
talking
to
anyone
else
or
to
let
anyone
else
talk
to
them
about
it,
about
the
case
if
they
persisted.
now,
he
--
he
was
--
he
had
a
little
trouble
in
his
mind.
mr.
satterly
shut
up
quickly
when
mr.
smith
demonstrated
with
him,
he
couldn't
talk
to
him
about
it.
but
mr.
smith
thought
maybe
that
came
within
the
judge's
instructions
and
being
a
conscientious
man,
he
finally
decided
to
relieve
his
mind.
he
would
have
to
report
it
to
the
judge.
he
did
report
it
to
the
judge
and
at
the
time
he
reported
it
to
the
judge,
he
chose
the
judge,
he
didn't
think
it
was
serious.
he
thought
it
was
a
joke.
that
word
joke
is
being
used
a
great
deal
in
here,
i
think,
what
he
did
was
he
didn't
consider
the
serious
remark.
it
was
a
passing
remark
made
in
a
joking
fashion
to
him
and
he
stopped
immediately.
he
told
the
judge
that.
the
judge
seemingly
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
and
he
told
him
to
treat
it
as
such.
now,
some
moment
is
made
to
the
fact
that
the
judge
called
in
the
f.b.i.
well,
it
was
not
an
--
exactly
the
point
of
what
the
judge
thought
of
it.
it
was
the
point
with
which
smith
thought
of
it.
smith
told
the
judge
at
that
time
--
we
think
that
was
evidence
that
corroborates
smith.
the
judge
testified
that
smith
told
him
contemporaneously
with
this
contact
with
him.
a
--
a
very
few
days
later,
the
f.b.i.
man
called
upon
him
in
his
office.privately,
we
admit
we
make
no
--
no
goings
about
that.
everything
was
done
here
that's
been
said
practically
in
the
way
of
factual
approach
to
the
juror.
we
--
the
f.b.i.man
in
talking
to
him
received
the
same
statement
that
he
didn't
think
that
satterly
was
serious
about
it.
he
thought
it
was
a
jocular
remark.so,
so
far
as
smith
was
concerned
that
end
of
the
matter.
the
judge,
when
the
f.b.i.
man
came
in,
he
told
him,
"he
thought
it
was
a
joke."
f.b.i.
man
made
a
report.
now,
we
say
that
that
is
strong
evidence
to
support
the
judge's
findings
that
smith
was
not
prejudiced.
if
he
didn't
take
the
remarks
seriously
then
it
follows
that
he
wasn't
prejudiced
in
the
remark
or
wouldn't
carry
it
along
with
him.
now,
the
judge
made
--
had
the
investigation
made.
he
probably
had
some
doubt
in
his
mind
of
what
this
man
satterly
was
doing
or
what
he
was
up
to.
he
probably
thought,
well,
we
better
investigate
him
and
see
what
he
did
said
--
say.
now,
the
--
the
conference
or
the
report
by
smith
to
the
judge
apparently
was
a
very
hurried
thing
and
between
the
recess
of
the
court
in
the
morning.
and
it's
quite
understandable
that
the
judge
couldn't
take
time
when
his
trial
was
on,
he
adjust
the
recess
to
call
a
further
--
further
recess
to
go
on
with
it
until
he
found
out
a
little
more
about
it.
so,
he
called
for
the
investigation
and
the
f.b.i.
man
did
investigate.
now,
there
is
further
testimony
that
smith
never
considered
it.
he
testified
that
he
never
consider
this
as
coming
from
the
defendant
which
of
course
supports
his
idea
that
it
wasn't
serious.
do
you
know
--
have
any
idea
it
was
coming
or
emanating
from
the
defendants
at
all
in
anyway
fashion.
so,
his
--
his
view
was
that
it
was
not
coming
from
the
defendant
and
that
if
he
had
thought
that
satterly
was
serious,
he
would
have
thought
merely
that
satterly
was
probably
just
trying
to
make
a
deal
on
his
own
since
--
feeling
him
out
to
see
whether
or
not
he
might
be
subject
to
something
if
he,
satterly,
wanted
to
going
in
a
little
farther
with
it.
now,
he
had
a
right
probably
to
think
along
those
lines.
satterly,
quite
didn't
--
didn't
seem
to
have
any
--
he
was
working
in
gambling
establishments.
didn't
seem
to
have
any
regular
business
or
profession,
perhaps
he
made
his
money
on
his
ways.
i
don't
know
it,
inferences
somewhat
along
that
line.
now
--
now
--
when
--
now,
there
is
also
evidence
by
mrs.
satterly
who
said
that
her
husband
was
always
a
joker.
she
testified
that.
satterly
by
the
way
could
not
recall
whether
or
not
--
he
could
not
recall
rather
that
he
had
made
the
remark.
he
said
if
he
had
made
such
a
remark,
it
was
only
in
fun.
now,
we
say
all
of
that,
the
totality
of
things
there
were
something
that
the
district
court
could
rely
on
a
showing
that
mr.
smith
wasn't
prejudiced
by
the
remark
itself
and
we
say
that
the
fact
that
he
didn't
consider
is
coming
from
the
defendant
adds
to
that
and
supports
it.
and
we
say
that
the
judge's
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
the
f.b.i.
agent
that
smith
told
them
contemporaneously
with
the
act
incident
that
he
didn't
consider
it
seriously.
we
think
that
is
a
corroboration
of
mr.
smith's
statement
after
hearing
here
that
he
didn't
consider
it
seriously
at
the
time
and
considered
it
was
made
in
a
jocular
mood
at
that
time.
now,
later
on
in
the
hearing,
mr.
smith
testified
that
he
wiped
the
matter
from
his
mind
after
the
--
he
talked
to
the
judge
and
the
f.b.i.
man.
he
had
nothing
more
in
his
mind
about
it
that
it
--
he
wiped
it
from
his
mind,
it
--
to
the
extent
that
he
forgot.
now,
we
say
all
of
these
things
tied
in
together
make
a
picture
from
which
the
court
could
reasonably
find
that
mr.
smith
was
not
prejudiced
at
any
time.
we
must
remember
that
this
was
a
long
trial.
it
went
on
for
weeks
after
this
and
mr.
smith
said
that
when
he
came
out
to
the
courtroom
after
the
verdict
had
been
rendered
and
the
newspaperman
were
waiting
to
meet
him
and
asked
him
about
it
that
he
was
dumbfounded
that
it
came
up
again
at
the
question.
he
was
astonished
by
the
whole
thing.
said
he'd
--
he'd
wiped
it
from
his
mind,
didn't
remember.
he
dismissed
the
whole
thing
from
his
mind.
now,
i
want
to
make
one
statement
about
the
satterly
statement
itself.
now,
it
is
--
there's
an
inference
in
there,
of
course,
there
some
quite
of
an
inference
in
there
of
bribery
or
some
imaginative.
possibly,
you
can
conjecture
that
the
man
meant
some
bribery
under
some
circumstances
but
it
isn't
a
direct
and
persistent
attempt
with
the
man
who
had
the
potential
service
fee
power
to
carry
it
through.
he
made
the
statement.
he
stopped.
mr.
smith
knew
he
was
going
to
leave
reno
permanently
the
next
day
at
least
he
told
him.
he
was
on
his
way,
that
is,
everything
packed
when
he
come
by.
the
reason
he
came
by
to
smith
because
he'd
had
an
accident
with
his
automobile
and
got
another
automobile
and
he
had
to
have
his
insurance
transferred.
but
he
knew
he
was
going
to
leave
reno
the
next
day
and
going
to
leave
the
state.
so,
we
say
that
taking
all
that
in
its
totality,
it
--
it
isn't
like
a
persistent
offer
to
bribe
somebody,
a
definite
offer
to
bribe.
it
isn't
as
serious
as
that
in
my
opinion
and
in
situations
where
there
is
a
strong
implication
that
it
comes
from
one
of
the
parties
in
the
case.
here,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
implication
at
all
that
mr.
satterly
was
there
at
the
behest
of
the
defendant
or
any
other
party
in
that
case.
and
mr.
smith
felt
the
same
way
about
it
and
he
was
the
man
contacted.
he
isn't
a
--
a
man
who
was
evasive
in
any
fashion.
he
isn't
a
man
who
can
say
anything
about
it.
he
wanted
to
relieve
his
mind.
he
wanted
to
be
honest
about
it.
he
went
to
the
judge
and
i
think
he
did
relieve
his
mind.
i
think
instead
of
hurting
the
defendant
by
going
to
the
judge,
i
think
he
helped
the
defendant.
he
relieved
his
own
mind
of
any
prejudice
of
any
he
ever
had.
any
lingering
doubts
that
he
had
if
he
had
any.
he
says
they
were
on
the
judge's
instructions,
not
that
it
came
from
the
defendant
or
not
that
he
was
serious.
but
he
was
a
little
worried
about
the
judge's
instructions.
now,
we
think
all
of
those
things
tie
in.
now,
mr.
smith
testified
directly,
he
didn't
have
any
prejudice
in
his
mind.
that
was
admitted
by
the
trial
judge
with
a
great
deal
of
misgiving.
he
was
afraid
that
authorities
might
be
divided
as
to
whether
that
was
admissible.
now,
there
are
authorities
to
the
effect.
it
is
admissible
if
it's
corroborated
and
we
say
it's
corroborated
here,
there's
something
corroborated
here
because
smith
testified
he
didn't
consider
it
seriously
and
that
was
corroborated
by
the
judge's
testimony
and
by
the
f.b.i.
agent's
testimony
of
what
smith
said
contemporaneously
with
the
contact.
so,
we
say
that's
corroborated.
now,
we
have
--
we
have
the
situation
then.
to
sum
up,
we
have
another
matter
of
the
(inaudible)
jury.
now,
i
don't
understand
the
record
of
saying
that
a
deputy
marshall
told
him
that
somebody
had
been
approached.
he
asked
him
if
he
heard
of
any
such
a
thing
and
when
he
asked
him
why
he
said,
"well,
i'm
just
curious."
now,
that
the
--
they
didn't
--
the
district
judge
didn't
seem
to
find
that
there
was
another,
that
the
evidence
on
that
did
find
that
the
evidence
was
so
vague
and
he
didn't
make
finding
on
that.
but
he
said
he
didn't
make
a
finding
that
there
was
no
--
no
significance
to
it,
no
prejudice.
he
didn't
say
anything
that
would
cause
him
to
--
to
put
prejudice
in
his
mind
and
i
think
the
judge
was
correct
in
making
that
finding.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
judge
that
he
was
correct
in
his
findings
on
these
things.
and
we
say
that
under
a
well-established
rule
of
this
court
laid
down
in
the
--
both
the,
i
believe
in
a
civil
matter
in
the
group
of
investors,
i
believe
it
is,
comstock
versus
group
of
investors.
i
have
to
find
that
in
my
brief,
that
--
and
the
delanay
case
and
smith
case.
they're
all
cited
on
our
--
i
can't
seem
to
(inaudible)
in
a
second.
on
those
--
on
those
cases
they
--
let
me
find
it
now,
comstock,
32
--
page
32
of
our
brief,
i
believe.
in
those
cases,
this
court
has
laid
down
the
rule
and
is
followed
pretty
closely
that
when
there's
a
concurrent
findings
of
two
courts
below,
this
court
won't
disturbed
them
unless
an
very
exceptional
error
has
been
made.
now,
we
say
there's
been
no
such
error
made
here
because
there
was
ample
evidence
before
the
district
court
to
support
his
decision.
now,
his
--
since
he
has
made
that
decisions,
since
he
has
made
the
finding
that
there
was
no
harm
in
conformity
with
this
court's
mandate
and
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
this
case
to
find
out
if
it
was
harmful.
petitioner's
says,
"oh,
well
there's
a
heavier
burden
than
that
on
the
government.
he
says
you
got
to
show
not
only
that
there
was
no
actual
harm
but
you
got
to
show
that
there
was
no
reasonable
possibility
of
harm.”
well,
now
he
--
he
seems
to
rely,
i
believe,
on
several
cases.
he
relies
on
stone,
113
f.2d
ca6
and
he
relies
on
little,
73
f.2d
861,
and
he
also
relies
on
marine
case,
a
district
court
case
in
delaware
but
that
seems
to
me
there's
two
particular
cases
there,
stone.
stone
stated
that
it
could
--
the
prejudice
could
be
overcome
only
by
showing
that
no
harm
might
be
done.
marine
said,
could
be
overcome
only
if
it
was
shown
that
no
harm
could
have
taken
place.
and
the
little
case
seems
to
hold,
there
isn't
overcome
unless
the
contact
was
necessarily
harmless.
now,
we
say
the
rule
of
those
three
cases
if
applied
here
is
in
conflict
with
this
court's
opinion
in
sending
it
back
down.
this
court
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
presumption
is
rebuttable.
now,
we
say
if
you
apply
or
could
be
a
rule
or
might
be
a
rule
or
unnecessarily
rule,
that
turns
the
presumption
into
a
conclusive
presumption
and
there
is
no,
shall
i
say
mathematical
way
of
showing
there's
no
factual
way
of
showing
whether
there
could
be
harm
or
whether
there
might
be
harm
or
necessarily
be
harm.
if
there
was
no
actual
harm
then
what
has
the
defendant
to
complain
of,
no
actual
harm.
now,
i
--
we
believe
that
this
court
laid
down
the
correct
law
when
it
sent
the
case
back
and
that
it
meant
what
it
said.
it
said
go
down
and
handle
the
hearing
and
determine
if
it
were
--
if
it
was
harmful
to
petitioner,
if
it
was
grant
a
new
trial.
we
say
that
was
what
the
court
did.
it
found
as
a
fact
and
that
there
was
no
necessity
of
it
to
go
into
speculation
as
to
what
might
be
or
what
could
be,
what
necessarily
might
be,
et
cetera.
now,
we
say
that
if
a
rule
is
laid
down
in
this
class
of
cases
which
foreclosess
all
fact
finding
then
it
opens
a
door
to
put
some
pretty
serious
abuses.
we
say
that
it
would
make
it
possible
every
little
jury
contact.
now,
we're
living
in
an
age
when
juries
aren't
locked
up
and
made
to
pass
while
they
are
going
through
their
deliberations,
as
they
once
were.
they
are
left
--
he
may
leave,
permitted
to
go
home.
now,
it
seems
humanly
impossible
that
there
may
not
be
a
transgression
of
the
judge's
orders
once
in
a
while
but
if
there
is
a
transgression,
we
say
this
court
has
laid
down
the
correct
rule
that
go
into
the
matter,
hold
a
hearing
and
point
out
that
there
was
any
actual
harm
done.
now,
if
there's
enough
evidence
to
do
that,
that
is
all
there
is
necessary
and
there's
no
need
of
a
new
trial.
if
it
wasn't
actually
harm,
we
don't
see
why
it
is
so
important
that
there
couldn't
have
been
any
harm,
or
might
have
been
any
harm.
now,
as
i
say,
if
that
--
if
the
answer
--
if
the
--
the
theory
underlying
that
is
that
we
must
that
all
then
is
to
protect
the
jury
system
which
--
which
of
course,
i
agree
that
we
must
protect
the
jury
system.
it
seems
though
we
mustn't
open
the
door
to
grave
abuses
of
the
jury
system.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
just
as
bad
to
open
the
door,
as
it
would
be
to
protect
the
system.
you're
going
to
protect
it
in
the
manner
that
may
destroy
it,
that's
dangerous.
i
--
i
could
--
a
state
of
--
a
statement
of
justice
cardozo
in
snyder
versus
massachusetts,
291
u.s.
122,
this
was
not
a
case
of
this
kind.
this
was
where
--
it
was
a
view
by
the
jury
without
the
defendant's
presence,
but
he
said
concerning
these
very
thin
things
that
come
on
in
criminal
cases.
he
says
there
is
danger
that
the
criminal
law
will
be
brought
into
contempt,
i
put
some
starts.
if
gossamer
possibilities
of
prejudice
to
a
defendant
or
can
nullify
a
sentence
pronounced
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
in
obedience
to
law
and
set
the
guilty
free.
now,
we
think
that
if
he
closes
the
door
to
fact
findings
and
make
conclusive
presumptions
that
it's
what
that
does,
it
would
open
the
door
to
abuses
and
make
every
contact
no
matter
what
something
that
you
couldn't
answer.
now,
we
don't
believe
the
lower
court
to
be
that.
mr.
john
r.
benney
no.
mr.
john
r.
benney
if
you
made
a
conclusive
presumption
out
of
it.
if
you
play
a
rule
of
law
which
makes
it
a
conclusive
presumption
then
of
course
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
this
court
to
send
it
back
down.
it
could
have.
it
knew
that
the
f.b.i.
investigated.
it
knew
that
he
was
contacted
through
the
precise
words
he
said
were
not
before
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
john
r.
benney
harm.
mr.
john
r.
benney
that
is
a
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
in
--
when
the
case
was
here
previously,
whether
there
was
any
harm
to
petitioner.
now,
the
judges
found
that.
mr.
john
r.
benney
that's
right.
mr.
john
r.
benney
and
the
court
has
found
that
there
was
no
harm
on
those
facts.
mr.
john
r.
benney
now,
we
say,
the
only
reviewable
problem
here
would
be
whether
the
judge
abused
his
discretion.
we
think
that's
the
only
reviewable
proposition
that
comes
before
this
court
in
the
ultimate.
did
he
really
--
did
he
abuse
his
discretion?
was
there
any
reasonable
amount
of
evidence
there?
was
there
--
could
--
i
would
say
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
--
that
there
was
harm
done.
mr.
john
r.
benney
the
burden
is
on
the
government.
we
admit
that's
--
this
court
told
us,
the
burden
was
on
the
government.
we
met
that
burden.
we
went
ahead
with
the
evidence,
went
on
with
26
witnesses.
we
did
all
of
that
and
we
say
now
it's
true.
i
--
i
don't
agree
your
honors
that
judges
should
talk
to
jurors
by
themselves
or
i
don't
believe
that
they
ought
to
call
in
the
f.b.i.
during
a
case.
but
--
and
it
may
will
be
that
the
court
made
a
mistake
in
doing
that.
but
we
say
that
matter
was
before
the
court
before
and
the
court
sent
it
back
for
a
hearing
on
the
facts
to
determine
harm,
and
we
say
therefore
that
if
you
can't
say
now
that
it
would've
lay
him
off
at
that
time,
that
it
would've
come
out
anything
more
than
come
out
at
this
time.
a
record
was
made
of
what
was
said
and
done,
not
only
by
the
judge
and
but
by
the
f.b.i.
man.
now,
it
does
seem
that's
a
little
different
from
everyone
calling
on
his
own
memory
at
this
late
date
to
determine
this.
they
are
corroborated
by
written
writings
that
were
made
contemporaneously
with
that.
now,
we
say
that
there
was
ample
evidence
here
to
do
that,
to
show
no
harm.
the
court
was
right
in
doing
it.
that
the
court
did
follow
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
for
it
to
follow
in
determining
whether
there
was
harm,
and
that
it
was
not
under
any
duty
to
apply
a
rule
of
any
other
quantum
or
measure
of
evidence
in
order
to
decide
the
case.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
should
be
affirmed.
