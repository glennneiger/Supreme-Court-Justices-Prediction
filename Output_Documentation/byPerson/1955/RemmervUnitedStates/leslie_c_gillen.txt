mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
these
questions.did
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
income
tax
case
receive
a
fair
trial
at
the
hands
of
an
impartial
jury
when
unknown
to
the
defense,
these
things
were
happening
during
the
trial.
a
friend
of
the
jury
foreman
met
with
and
conversed
with
the
jury
foreman
and
told
him
that
the
defendant
was
a
tax
evader
and
proposed
to
him
the
possibility
of
receiving
a
bribe.
the
f.b.i.
investigated
the
matter.
an
f.b.i.
agent
interviewed
this
juror
during
the
trial.
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
and
the
united
states
attorney
prosecuting
the
case
determined
to
keep
this
matter
concealed
completely
from
the
defense
which
they
did.
and
later,
a
deputy
united
states
marshal
in
charge
of
the
jury
revealed
the
happening
to
a
second
juror
and
told
this
second
juror
that
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
tamper
with
the
jury.
now,
it
may
please
the
court
before
embarking
upon
the
facts
that
i
believe
should
be
considered
here.
may
i
take
a
moment
of
the
court's
time
to
record
to
the
court
the
judicial
events
that
brought
this
case
before
this
court
today?
the
petitioner
was
indicted
for
three
income
--
three
income
tax
years
returns
for
himself
and
his
wife.
on
february
22nd,
1952,
he
was
convicted
or
two
of
these
years
and
that
the
jury
disagreed
as
to
one
other
year
which
happen
to
be
the
largest
year
involved.
the
trial
lasted
for
three
full
months
and
this
was
an
involved
and
closed
network
case
and
the
jury
deliberated
for
two
days.
now,
a
tiny
motion
was
made
for
a
new
trial
and
included
in
that
motion
was
a
motion
for
a
hearing
on
the
extraneous
jury
contacts
which
incidentally
came
to
the
attention
of
the
defense
for
the
first
time
through
inquiries
by
newspaper
reporters,
the
morning
after
the
verdict
was
returned.
the
court
denied
a
hearing
of
the
extraneous
jury
contacts
and
this
was
upheld
by
a
decision
of
the
appellate
court
for
the
ninth
circuit.
this
court
held
that
it
was
error
to
deny
the
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
extraneous
jury
contacts
and
remanded
the
matter
to
the
district
court
with
a
directive
that,
an
inquiry,
a
full
hearing
should
be
given
to
the
jury
incident
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
incident
complained
of
was
harmful.
the
matter
was
assigned
to
united
states
district
judge
goodman
of
the
northern
districts
of
california
and
the
hearing
was
held
in
reno
--
in
carson
city,
nevada.
the
--
judge
goodman
on
july
10th,
1954
made
a
finding
and
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
he
found
that
the
incident
was
harmless.
the
petitioner
petitioned
this
court
for
a
rehearing
which
was
granted
and
the
entire
matter
that
is
the
extraneous
jury
incident
and
the
other
points
that
had
been
raised
in
the
initial
appeal
were
remanded
by
this
court
to
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
when
that
was
done,
the
petitioner,
because
this
particular
jury
question
had
never
been
briefed
or
orally
argued
particularly
since
the
remanded
hearing,
the
petitioner
petitioned
the
circuit
court
for
permission
to
file
briefs,
seriatim
briefs
and
to
present
an
oral
argument.
the
circuit
court
ordered
that
concurrent
briefs
to
be
filed
and
denied
the
right
to
argue
and
part
of
the
matter
submitted
without
argument.
the
circuit
court
returned
a
per
curiam
opinion
in
which
no
reference
are
mentioned
or
discussion
was
contained
concerning
any
point
that
was
raised
including
of
course
this
jury
point.
now,
the
--
the
petitioner
then
appealed
to
this
court
and
certiorari
was
granted
and
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
the
first
opportunity
that
we
have
or
that
we
have
had
to
present
oral
argument
on
this
particular
point.
the
petitioner
wishes
to
present
to
this
court
three
major
contentions.
the
first
contention
is
that
the
evidence
developed
--
that
they
developed
at
the
remanded
hearing
before
the
district
court,
not
only
fails
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
prejudice
but
on
the
contrary,
it
reveals
such
a
shocking
disregard
for
simple
justice
as
to
leave
no
conclusion
except
the
prejudice
resulted.
our
second
major
contention
is
that
the
district
judge,
judge
goodman,
assigned
to
the
remanded
hearing
misconstrued
the
scope
of
this
court's
order
with
regard
to
what
sort
of
a
hearing
should
be
held.
and
third,
we
contend
that
district
judge
goodman
applied
incorrect
rules
to
the
presumption
of
prejudice.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
very
briefly
the
facts
in
this
matter
are
these.
the
trial
started
on
november
28th
in
carson
city,
nevada
and
as
i
have
indicated,
the
court
ended
on
february
22nd,
1952.
on
the
night
of
december,
18th,
when
the
trial
was
a
little
more
than
two
weeks
under
way,
mr.
i.
j.
smith,
the
juror,
who
later
became
a
foreman
of
the
jury
and
incidentally,
there
were
two
alternate
jurors
who
sat
throughout
the
trial.
mr.
smith
received
a
visit
at
his
home
from
one
satterly.
now,
mr.
satterly
was
a
professional
craft
dealer.
he
was
a
felon.
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
felony
and
had
served
time
in
oregon
penitentiary.
he
was
a
business
client
of
mr.
smith's.
he
was
a
hunting
companion
of
mr.
smith.
he
was
a
friend
whom
mr.
smith
described
as
one
whom
he
knew
quite
well.
the
ostensible
purpose
of
the
visit
was
insurance
business.
present
at
the
visit
were
the
two
wives
of
the
two
men.
the
wives
sat
at
one
end
of
the
living
room,
the
two
men
setup
the
other
end
of
the
living
room
and
a
conversion
was
had
and
during
the
conversation,
mr.
satterly
said
to
mr.
smith,
"you
are
on
the
jury.
i
know
bones
remmer
very
well.
he
sold
cal-neva
for
$350,000
on
top
of
the
table.
i
believe
he
got
rather
$850,000
on
top
of
the
table.
i
believe
he
got
$350,000
under
the
table.
he
has
$300,000
that
he
daresn't
--
d-a-r-e-s-n-t
touch.
"why
don't
you
make
a
deal
with
bones?"
now,
in
order
to
avoid
any
confusion,
i
might
explain
to
the
court
that
petitioner,
elmer
f.
remmer
has
a
nickname,
bones,
and
is
commonly
known
as
bones
remmer.
and
i
might
also
explain
to
the
court
that
the
cal-neva
referred
to
here
is
a
summer
resort
in
lake
tahoe
and
it
is
so
situated
that
the
state
lines
of
nevada
and
california
run
through
its
main
lobby
so
that
legitimate
gambling
takes
place
on
the
nevada
side
of
the
resort
and
the
california
side
of
the
resort
was
simply
a
summer
resort,
and
remmer
had
owned
controlling
shares
ultimately
in
the
cal-neva
corporation.
now,
that
was
a
quote,
the
exact
quote
which
i
gave,
your
honor,
which
was
found
in
the
f.b.i.
or
presented
by
the
f.b.i.
agent
who
investigated
the
matter.
now,
when
this
was
said
to
mr.
smith,
mr.
smith
replied
heatedly
and
angrily
and
raised
his
voice
to
such
a
pitch
that
it
attracted
the
attention
of
his
wife
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
he
admonished
mr.
satterly,
"i
am
on
the
jury.
i
can't
discuss
this
case
or
you
can't
discuss
this
with
me."
smith
fretted
over
this
incident,
the
true
meaning
and
the
true
intention
of
these
remarks
by
mr.
satterly
for
two
whole
days
as
he
sat
on
the
jury.
and
on
december
the
28th,
he
determined
that
he
should
report
the
matter
to
the
trial
judge,
federal
judge
foley
of
the
district
of
nevada.
and
during
the
court
recess,
the
morning
recess
of
the
court,
he
went
into
the
judge's
chambers
and
he
reported
the
matter
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
called
in
his
secretary
and
had
her
take
down
in
shorthand
what
mr.
smith
said
and
the
quote
that
mr.
smith
attributed
to
mr.
satterly.
now,
for
some
reason
we
know
not
why,
mr.
smith
didn't
give
judge
foley
the
entire
conversation
at
that
time
but
he
reported
to
judge
foley
that
this
was
what
satterly
said
and
i
quote
from
the
shorthand
from
the
stenographer's
notes
that
were
made
at
that
time.
he
said
that
mr.
satterly
said
to
him,
"i
know
bones
remmer.
you
are
a
member
of
the
jury,
why
don't
you
make
a
deal
with
me?"
and
for
some
reason
or
other,
he
didn't
make
any
reference
to
the
cal-neva
incident
or
the
cal-neva
reference
by
satterly.
the
trial
judge
as
i
say
called
in
a
secretary,
she
took
a
note
down
and
that
became
an
exhibit
at
the
hearing
before
judge
goodman.
later
that
day,
the
trial
judge
called
in
the
prosecuting
deputy
united
states
attorney,
the
man
who
was
prosecuting
the
case
and
confidentially
revealed
to
him
what
smith
had
reported.
and
together,
they
determined
that
the
f.b.i.
should
be
called
in
to
make
an
investigation
and
together,
they
determined
that
this
matter
should
be
concealed
from
the
defense.
and
they
were
quite
frank
afterwards,
both
to
the
public
press
and
at
the
hearing
before
judge
goodman
as
to
why
they
concealed
it
from
the
defense.
they
suspected
that
the
defense
had
inspired
satterly's
visit
to
smith
and
if
this
were
so,
they
wanted
to
catch
the
defense
red-handed.
now,
on
december
22nd,
two
days
later,
an
f.b.i.
agent
by
the
name
of
collister
visited
and
questioned
mr.
smith.
and
at
that
time,
mr.
smith
gave
the
agent
a
more
complete
statement
of
what
had
transpired
in
the
satterly
visit.
and
at
that
time,
he
gave
mr.
collister
this
more
comprehensive
quote
and
may
i
quote
that
again,
he
quoted
--
mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
at
page
167
of
the
hearing
before
judge
goodman,
the
remanded
hearing
and
it
is
an
exhibit,
is
it
(d),
is
it
not?
mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
sir?
mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
yes,
your
honor.
it
had
begun
on
november
the
28th
and
continued
throughout
with
some
recesses.
mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
sir?
mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
there
were
saturday
and
sunday
recesses
and
later
on
in
the
trial,
may
it
please
the
court,
due
to
some
blizzards
there
was
a
recess
and
also,
there
was
a
christmas,
one
or
two-day
christmas
recess
because
christmas,
the
christmas
season
had
intervened.
i
might
--
might
read
from
page
67
this
exhibit
--
167
this
exhibit,
these
were
the
notes
of
the
f.b.i.
agent.
smith
"yes,
i'm
busy
everyday."
he
said,
and
that
refers
to
satterly.
"i
know
bones
remmer
very
well.
he
sold
cal-neva
club
for
$850,000
on
top
of
the
table,
believed
he
got
$350,000
under
the
table,
has
about
$300,000
that
he
daresn't
touch.
why
don't
you
make
a
deal
with
bones?"
smith
stopped
him.
"you
know
jim.
i'm
not
supposed
to
talk
about
that
case
over
there.
i'm
on
the
jury.”
no
more
was
said.
the
court
had
questioned
him
not
to
talk
about
the
case
but
a
person
persisted
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
thought
that
satterly
was
feeling
him
out,
i
don't
believe
he
has
been
in
contact
with
remmer
but
believe
he
would
make
arrangements
if
reception
been
cordial.
remmer
watched
smith
enter
judge's
chambers
to
talk
to
judge
during
recess
thursday
morning,
thought
it
over,
decided
to
report
it
and
so
on.
now,
if
i
may
proceed.
on
december
the
24th,
1951,
the
f.b.i.
agent
made
a
preliminary
report
to
the
prosecuting
deputy
united
states
attorney
and
in
that
report,
he
said
that
he
had
found
no
evidence
to
connect
the
defense
with
satterly
or
satterly's
visit.
and
it
might
be
noted
here
that
the
f.b.i.
agent
had
not
attempted
to
contact
satterly
or
to
interview
satterly
or
nobody
from
the
f.b.i.
had.
sattery
--
satterly
had
left
the
state
but
satterly's
new
out-of-state
address
had
been
provided
by
smith
or
arranged
to
be
obtained
by
smith
for
the
agent.
on
january
the
4th,
the
agent
reported
his
findings
to
the
trial
judge.further
investigation
was
suspended
but
the
investigation
was
not
closed.
in
fact,
it
was
not
closed
for
better
than
two
months
later.
in
fact,
it
was
not
closed
until
16
days
after
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
and
as
i
have
stated
to
the
court,
the
defense
knew
nothing
with
these
goings
on
throughout
the
entire
trial
and
until
the
morning
after
the
verdict
was
returned
when
newspaper
reporters
came
and
made
inquiries
of
us
as
to
what
we
would
have
done
if
we
had
known
that
these
things
had
been
going
on.
now,
on
january
the
4th,
1952
when
the
f.b.i.
agent
reported
to
the
judge
what
he
had
found
out.
the
f.b.i.
agent
told
the
judge
about
the
reference
to
cal-neva
and
the
over-the-table
purchase
price
and
the
under-the-table
purchase
price
incidentally,
cal-neva
--
remmer's
interest
in
cal-neva
was
sold
along
time
after
the
closing
bracket
of
the
indictment
period,
years
later.
however,
the
cal-neva
--
remmer's
financial
connections
with
cal-neva
corporation
was
a
very
important
issue
in
the
trial
because
his
growing
account
and
various
other
things
had
been
testified
to
by
numerous
witnesses
throughout
the
trial.
in
fact,
it
was
referred
to
in
the
opening
statement,
the
trial
judge
knew
that
it
was
an
issue
and
the
trial
judge
learned
as
the
trial
went
along
before
smith
reported
to
him
and
after
smith
reported
to
him
that
cal-neva
was
a
very
important
issue.
now,
apparently,
from
the
record,
the
first
that
the
trial
judge
heard
of
the
cal-neva
reference
by
satterly
and
his
visit
to
smith
was
when
the
reporter
reported
the
matter
--
the
agent
reported
the
matter
to
him.
the
trial
judge
did
nothing
to
mitigate
whatever
had
occurred
here
in
the
way
of
prejudice
or
bias.
he
--
he
didn't
declare
a
mistrial.
he
didn't
call
in
the
defense
although
in
january
the
4th,
he
was
advised
there
was
no
evidence
the
defense
had
any
culpability
in
this
thing.
he
didn't
replace
smith
by
one
of
the
alternate
jurors
and
he
didn't
even
make
--
but
in
our
opinion
would
be
--
have
been
a
very
feeble
and
futile
attempt
to
disabuse
smith's
mind
of
any
bias
that
he
may
have
had.
and
may
it
please
the
court,
throughout
this
entire
trial
then,
smith,
later
became
foreman
of
the
jury,
smith
was
left
on
tenterhooks.
smith
was
left
without
any
knowledge
or
information
as
to
what
was
happening
to
this
investigation.
for
all
he
knew,
he
was
under
scrutiny
and
suspicion
himself
throughout
the
trial.
for
all
he
knew,
satterly
might
have
been
contacted
by
the
nationwide
f.b.i.
organization
and
for
all
he
knew
satterly
for
self-preservation,
realizing
that
it
was
a
serious
matter
might
have
attempted
to
turn
the
tables
on
him
and
said,
"i
didn't
proposition
smith.
smith
propositioned
me.
i
didn't
suggest
the
bribe
to
him.
he
suggested
the
bribe
to
me."
for
all
mr.
smith
knew,
those
things
were
going
on
behind
his
back
and
we
may
well
realize
what
could
have
been
the
natural
reactions
of
mr.
smith
while
he
sat
through
that
jury
with
this
cloud
hanging
over
his
head.
certainly,
it's
not
unreasonable
to
believe
that
mr.
smith
felt
that
his
position
was
a
very
precarious
one.
certainly,
when
he
became
foreman
of
the
jury
and
commenced
on
his
deliberations
with
the
jury,
mr.
smith
must
--
as
any
human
being
would
have
felt,
must
have
felt
or
must
have
considered
seriously
what
will
be
thought
of
me
or
what
will
even
happen
to
me
if
i
dare
vote
for
an
acquittal
in
this
case.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
third
--
the
fourth
extraneous
contact
took
place
with
another
juror
by
the
name
of
curnow,
his
friend
with
whom
he
belonged
to
a
pistol
team,
the
deputy
united
states
marshal
boyd,
he
was
one
of
the
marshals
in
charge
of
the
jury
encountered
him
during
the
trial
at
the
time
which
he
placed
at
about
the
middle
of
the
three
months
--
of
the
three
months
trial
and
asked
him
if
he
had
been
approached
by
anyone
on
the
outside
about
the
case
and
told
him,
and
there
are
two
statements
made
by
mr.
(inaudible)
on
this,
told
him
that
somebody
had
attempted
to
bribe
the
juror
or
told
him
that
somebody
had
attempted
to
approach
a
juror.
now,
coming
from
a
government
official
who
is
also
his
friend,
it
can
readily
be
conceived
that
this
left
its
mark
upon
mr.
(inaudible)
mr.
(inaudible)
when
this
matter
was
called
to
his
attention
by
mr.
boyd,
remembered
that
he
had
seen
a
woman
juror,
a
mrs.
mack
walking
into
the
judges
chambers
and
he
concluded
that
it
mustn't
have
been
mrs.
mack
who
was
involved
in
this
attempted
approach.
now,
as
it
developed
a
long
time
later,
mrs.
mack
had
paid
during
the
course
of
the
trial
a
visit
to
the
judge
in
his
chambers.
and
mrs.
mack
had
gone
there
for
an
altogether
different
mission
something
to
do
with
the
health
problem
of
her
own.
but
certainly,
this
impression
that
was
left
with
(inaudible)
was
carried
into
the
jury
room
by
him
when
he
deliberated.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
in
its
previous
decision
in
this
case
--
in
its
previous
decision
in
this
case
stated
that
any
--
in
a
criminal
case,
any
private
communication,
contact
or
tampering
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
juror
during
a
trial
about
the
matter
pending
before
the
jury
is
for
obvious
reasons
deemed
presumptively
prejudicial.
if
not
made
in
pursuance
of
no
on
--
rules
of
court
and
instructions
and
directions
of
the
court
made
during
the
trial
with
full
knowledge
of
the
parties.
now,
fitting
the
facts
as
i
have
related
them
to
your
honors
with
the
example
laid
down,
we
find
the
facts
to
reveal
this.
there
were
four
direct
private
communications
and
contacts
involving
two
jurors
during
the
trial.
they
were
about
the
matter
pending.
they
were
not
made
in
pursuance
of
known
rules
of
the
court
and
the
instructions
and
directions
of
the
court
made
during
the
trial
and
they
were
without
the
full
knowledge
of
the
parties
because
as
i
have
said
throughout
the
entire
trial,
the
defense
was
ignorant
of
all
these
going
on
--
goings
on
behind
their
backs.
for
those
reasons,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
contend
that
the
petitioner
by
reason
of
these
extraneous
communications
with
the
jurors,
the
petitioner
was
prejudiced
in
four
specific
respects.
first,
satterly's
pretended
acquaintanceship
incidentally
developed
later
on
at
the
remanded
hearing,
two
and
half
years
later
that
satterly
didn't
know
remmer
at
all,
only
knew
him
by
sight,
knew
his
nickname,
bones.
satterly's
pretended
acquaintanceship
with
remmer
and
satterly's
pretended
knowledge
that
remmer
had
gotten
$350,000
under
the
table
and
therefore,
evaded
tax
to
that
extent.
and
the
fact
that
recounting
the
issue
had
become
a
very
important
issue
throughout
the
trial
in
our
opinion
was
never
negative
and
that
impression
was
left
with
the
jurors
who
knew
about
it
or
heard
about
it
particularly
mr.
smith.
second,
the
evidence
taken
at
the
remanded
hearing
does
not
establish
that
satterly's
bribery
proposal
was
harmless
or
was
a
joke.
and
third,
dependency
of
the
f.b.i.
investigation
throughout
the
trial
which
kept
smith
on
tenterhooks
and
led
him
to
believe
that
he
might
be
under
suspicion
and
scrutiny
and
the
defense
being
kept
in
ignorance
and
certainly
under
suspicion
because
satterly's
--
satterly
had
never
been
contacted
or
interviewed
to
determine
what
he
meant
by
his
remarks,
we
submit
respectively
deprive
petitioner
of
a
fair
trial.
now,
the
court
--
this
court
in
its
previous
opinion
in
this
case
recognizes
this
danger
in
this
language.
the
sending
of
an
f.b.i.
agent
--
i
quote,
the
sending
of
an
f.b.i.
agent
in
the
midst
of
a
trial
to
investigate
a
juror
as
to
its
conduct
is
bound
to
impress
the
juror
and
is
very
apt
to
do
so
unduly.
a
juror
must
be
of
free
to
exercise
his
functions
without
the
f.b.i.
or
anyone
else
looking
over
his
shoulder.
now,
certainly
mr.
smith
was
left
to
believe
having
received
no
further
information
on
the
subject.
he
was
left
to
believe
that
the
f.b.i.
and
perhaps
the
--
the
trial
judge
and
perhaps
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
lord
knows
who
else
was
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
he
sat
there
deliberating,
listening
to
the
evidence
and
ultimately
deliberating
on
the
jury.
now,
on
the
case
--
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
reference
has
been
made
and
in
fact
it
was
adapted
and
capitalized
upon
by
the
government
in
this
case
that
satterly's
approach
may
have
been
an
innocuous
approach,
may
have
been
a
joke
and
the
speculation
that
it
was
a
joke
has
gathered
momentum
in
the
case.
now,
i
would
like
the
court's
permission
to
just
analyze
whether
anybody
that
was
concerned
with
this
matter
at
anytime
treated
it
as
a
joke.
smith
didn't
treat
it
as
a
joke
first
because
when
the
approach
to
him
was
made,
he
replied
angrily
to
a
client
and
a
friend.
he
raised
his
voice
heatedly
so
that
it
attracted
his
wife's
attention.
he
worried
and
fretted
for
two
days
and
then
he
went
in
and
reported
the
matter
to
the
trial
judge
during
the
trial.
now,
the
trial
judge
didn't
treat
it
as
a
joke.
he
had
his
secretary
take
down
a
memorandum
in
shorthand
and
get
the
exact
words
that
were
spoken
and
they
even
noted
the
time
that
the
report
was
made,
11:05
on
the
morning
of
december
the
20th
that
mr.
smith
came
into
the
chambers
and
reported
this.
the
trial
judge
didn't
take
it
as
a
joke
or
consider
it
as
a
joke
when
he
called
in
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
the
government
and
confidentially
told
him
what
had
happened.
now,
the
prosecutor
didn't
take
it
as
a
joke
when
he
and
the
judge
decided
to
call
in
the
f.b.i.
to
make
an
investigation
to
see
whether
all
this
was
inspired
by
the
defense.
and
they
didn't
take
it
as
a
joke
when
they
decided
to
keep
it
from
the
defense
because
they
felt
if
they
let
the
defense
in
on
it,
it
would
frustrate
the
investigation
that
they
were
going
to
have
the
f.b.i.
make.
now,
the
f.b.i.
didn't
take
it
as
a
joke
because
the
f.b.i.
agent
had
to
get
an
official
clearance
from
washington
d.c.
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
make
the
investigation.
and
the
f.b.i.
in
washington
d.c.
didn't
consider
it
as
a
joke
because
they
gave
official
authorization
for
the
investigation
to
be
made
and
the
f.b.i.
agent
didn't
consider
it
as
a
joke
when
he
went
and
interviewed
mr.
smith.
and
mr.
smith
didn't
consider
it
as
a
joke
when
he
enlarged
on
the
visit
of
satterly.
and
none
of
the
government
officials
were
involved
and
that
thing
considered
as
a
joke
when
they
held
the
investigation
opened
and
didn't
close
it
until
16
days
after
the
trial
had
ended
and
the
petitioner
had
been
convicted.
and
certainly,
mr.
boyd,
the
deputy
united
states
marshal
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
didn't
consider
it
as
a
joke
when
he
told
his
friend,
(inaudible)
that
somebody
had
been
--
had
made
an
attempt
to
bribe
or
an
attempt
to
tamper
with
the
jury.
and
so
we
say,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
certain
--
certainly
this
was
not
at
anytime
considered
a
joke
by
anyone
concerned
and
this
mere
speculated
contention
that
it
might
have
been
a
joke
is
something
that
it
is
now
being
used
--
is
now
being
as
an
excuse
for
the
flagrant
conduct
of
this
entire
matter.
no
attempt
was
ever
made
even
though
it
might
have
been
to
have
abuse
smith's
--
disabuse
smith's
mind
of
the
possibility
that
here
was
a
serious
thing
that
he
was
involved
in.
we
feel
that
even
if
the
attempt
have
been
made
that
it
would
have
been
futile
because
we
feel
it
from
the
very
moment
that
this
incident
occurred
with
satterly
and
smith
began
worrying
about
it
that
smith
was
fatally
infected
with
prejudice.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
petitioner
contends
that
judge
goodman
applied
incorrect
rules
or
rather
judge
goodman
misconstrued
the
scope
of
this
court's
directive
on
the
remanded
hearing.
judge
goodman
interpreted
this
court's
remand
to
mean
that
this
court
intended
by
the
words
that
were
used,
intended
that
an
inquiry
should
be
made
to
determine
whether
the
visit
of
the
f.b.i.
agent
to
mr.
smith
alone
was
harmful
and
to
ignore
all
the
other
things
in
the
--
and
the
results
of
those
other
things
that
occurred
subsequently.
we
don't
believe
that
judge
goodman
was
warranted
in
adapting
such
a
limited
interpretation
because
this
court
in
its
opinion
used
interchangeably
the
plural
firm
of
--
form
of
the
word
"incidents"
as
well
as
the
singular
form
of
the
word
"incident".
we
had
asked
for
a
comprehensive
hearing
from
the
trial
judge
and
from
the
circuit
court
and
from
this
court
to
determine
just
exactly
what
happened,
and
we
believe,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
this
court
was
and
is
now
concerned
with
everything
that
happened
that
may
reasonably
have
created
a
prejudice
in
the
minds
of
any
juror
or
a
juror
whether
it
was
an
incident
or
whether
it
was
several
incidences.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
our
final
major
contention
is
that
judge
goodman
applied
incorrect
rules
as
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
--
presumption
of
prejudice,
i
beg
your
pardon,
presumption
of
prejudice.
he
followed
--
he
did
not
follow
the
rule
that
has
been
consistently
adhered
to
by
all
of
the
decided
cases
that
we
have
read
passing
on
this
problem.
those
cases
hold
that
the
presumption
of
prejudice
requires
a
new
trial
unless
the
circumstances
foreclose
any
reasonable
possibility
of
harm.
and
we
understand
that
all
the
petitioner
has
to
do
is
to
show
that
the
overt
thing
occurred
and
then
from
what
occurred
is
to
be
determined
whether
or
not
any
reasonable
harm
would
have
come
or
whether
or
not
the
presumption
has
been
overcome
by
showing
that
it
was
entirely
innocuous
thing
as
some
of
the
cases
related
where
a
judge
--
trial
judge
steps
to
the
door
of
the
jury
room
and
says,
“do
you
jurors
want
to
go
to
lunch
now
or
later
today?”
the
--
we
say,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
hearing,
the
remanded
hearing
not
only
failed
utterly
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
prejudice
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
developed
some
additional
things
from
which
the
only
conclusion
that
could
be
reached
was
that
prejudice
resulted.
now,
judge
goodman
in
misapplying
the
rules
concerning
such
an
incident
as
this
stated
in
his
opinion
as
follows.
and
i
will
read
from
page
38
of
the
hearing
transcript
which
is
part
of
judge
goodman's
opinion.
he
says,
"but
that
means,
that
decision
would
rest
on
conjecture
and
hypothesis
and
not
fact.
the
supreme
court
had
the
power
to
decide
the
question
involved
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
did
not
do
so,
hence,
our
decision
must
be
on
fact."
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
found
in
this
court's
previous
opinion
--
previous
opinion
at
page
229
of
remmer
versus
the
united
states,
347
u.s.229.
this
court
said,
we
do
not
know
from
this
record
nor
does
the
petitioner
know
what
actually
transpired
or
whether
the
incidents
that
may
have
occurred
were
harmful
or
harmless.
and
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
why
this
court
didn't
decide
that
at
the
time.
in
other
words,
there
had
never
been
a
hearing
held
to
determine
just
exactly
what
had
happen,
what
had
transpired
and
now,
there
was
a
hearing
held
to
determine
just
what
had
happened.
and
that
hearing
we
submit
wasn't
to
be
limited
to
one
thing,
it
was
to
be
limited,
it
was
to
encompass
anything
that
may
have
violated
the
sanctity
that
surrounds
a
jury
in
any
case.
we
feel,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
judge
goodman
took
the
position
of
removing
the
burden
which
this
court
has
said
rest
heavily
upon
the
government
when
such
a
thing
occurs
as
this,
remove
the
burden
from
the
government
and
place
it
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
petitioner.
and
in
effect
require
the
petitioner
to
prove
that
he
had
been
harmed
rather
than
insist
that
the
government
prove
that
the
facts
did
not
reveal
reasonably
that
any
harm
could
have
been
--
could
have
befallen
the
petitioner.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
respectfully
suggest
after
having
read
every
decided
case,
i
believe,
extent
involving
the
extraneous
contacts
with
jurors.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
most
flagrant
case
of
record.
we
believe
that
it
is
far
more
flagrant
that
what
occurred
even
in
the
mattox
case
because
in
this
case,
the
judge
participated
in
what
went
on
and
the
judge
honestly
though
he
may
have
done
it
instead
of
attempting
to
mitigate
the
harm
was
to
--
which
was
done
actually
exercise
judgment
which
exaggerated
or
--
or
aggravated
what
harm
may
have
been
done.
and
we
submit,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
conclusion
that
all
of
these
things
that
i
have
related
to
this
court
lead
inevitably
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
prejudice
that
was
never
overcome
that
befell
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
answer
one
or
two
contentions
made
by
my
opponent.
he
began
by
saying
very
lightly
that
mr.
smith
after
this
encounter
with
mr.
satterly,
that
it
bothered
his
mind
a
little
and
that
he
reported
it
to
the
judge
and
after
that,
the
weight
of
this
burden
was
taken
off
his
shoulders
and
he
thought
no
more
about
it,
everything
was
fine
after
that.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
throughout
the
entire
trial
mr.
smith
was,
as
i
pointed
out
before
i
left,
uninformed
of
what
kind
of
an
investigation
was
being
made,
what
was
being
developed
by
it,
what
was
the
result
of
it,
whether
he
was
being
watched
or
not.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
find
and
the
record
reveals
that
on
the
very
night
of
february
22nd,
1952,
immediately
after
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
and
was
discharged.
and
on
their
way
home
that
mr.
smith
was
still
fretting
over,
and
worrying
over,
and
puzzled
over
the
contact
that
he
had
from
mr.
satterly
--
with
mr.
stterly.
there
was
an
arrangement
between
these
jurors,
an
expanse
sharing
arrangement
that
they
would
ride
back
and
forth
those
who
lived
in
reno,
back
and
forth
to
carson
city,
a
distance
30
miles
where
the
case
was
being
tried.
and
mr.
smith,
a
juror,
mr.
timken,
juror
mrs.
mack,
and
a
juror
--
alternate
juror
morris
rode
back
and
fought
together.
as
they
were
riding
back
to
reno,
after
returning
the
verdict
on
the
night
of
february
22nd,
1952,
as
the
record
reveals,
mr.
smith
advised
or
informed
mr.
timken
that
during
the
trial,
he
had
been
approached
by
someone
and
that
he
was
not
sure.
but
that
he
was
being
felt
out
to
see
whether
or
not
he
would
be
amenable
to
taking
a
bribe
and
that
he
had
reported
it
to
the
judge
and
that
is
found
at
page
184
of
the
remanded
hearing
transcript.
the
question
was
by
the
united
states
attorney,
"do
you
recall
during
that
trip?"
this
is
the
trip
home,
"the
conversation
between
you
and
mr.
smith
and
mrs.
mack?"
answer
"it
was
a
general
conversation,
what
a
relief
it
was
to
be
through
with
the
thing
and
what
a
strain
it
had
been
and
so
on
and
so
forth."
and
then
he
says,
i
think
this
is
the
concluding
lines
of
his
answer.
mr.
smith
mentioned
that
he
didn't
know
whether
he
had
been
approached
or
not,
and
so
he
reported
it
to
the
judge
and
it
was
passed
over.
that
was
about
the
text
to
the
thing.
i
couldn't
say
word
for
word.
and
on
the
next
page,
he
was
asked
whether
during
the
trip
--
whether
during
the
trip
to
from
carson
city
to
reno,
"did
mr.
smith
tell
you
at
that
time,
what
happened
to
him?"
answer
"that
as
you
mean
as
to
satterly?”
question
“yes.”
answer
“he
didn't
use
any
name
as
i
can
remember
and
as
i've
said,
it
was
mentioned
in
a
casual
way.
he
--
he
had
thought
possibly,
he
had
been
approached,
and
he
had
brought
it
to
the
judge.”
now
--
and
the
question
"he
mentioned
it
on
that
trip?"
answer
"yes.
that
night."
now,
that
was
the
night
after
the
--
immediately
after
returning
the
verdict.
now,
on
that
night
when
they
got
from
carson
city
to
reno,
they
changed
automobiles
and
mr.
smith
drove
mrs.
mack
to
her
home
at
another
part
--
in
another
area
of
reno.
and,
at
that
time,
at
her
front
door,
they
had
a
conversation.
and
that
is
found,
may
it
please
the
court,
at
page
174
and
page
175
of
the
remanded
hearing
transcript.
and
this
was
--
i
believe,
the
jury's
examination
--
oh,
this
is
cross-examination
and
by
myself,
question
“mrs.
mac,
did
mr.
irving
jay
smith
ever
thanked
you
for
participating
in
finding
mr.
remmer
guilty
on
some
of
the
counts
of
the
indictment
and
tell
you
that
he
had
been
under
pressure?"
answer
"he
did."
and
on
page
175,
i
might
read
the
answer,
"and
when
and
where
did
he
say
that?"
answer
"that
night
he
brought
me
home
from
carson
city
on
february
23rd,"
it
was
the
22nd,
she
made
an
error
on
the
date,
"and
picked
up
his
car,
mr.
timken's
house
and
brought
me
to
my
home
at
105
gardener
street.
i
asked
mr.
smith
if
owed
him
any
money
and
he
said,
no,
and
i
thanked
him
for
the
ride.
and
he
also
said
to
me,
i
want
to
thank
you
too
mrs.
mack
because,
i
had
been
under
terrible
pressure."
and
lower
down
on
the
same
page
175.
question
"did
you
ask
mr.
smith
what
he
meant
by
his
remark
that
he
was
under
pressure?"
answer
"i
didn't
truly
ask
mr.
smith,
no.
he
said,
sometime
i
will
discuss
it
or
we
will
to
get
together
and
talk
or
something
of
that
kind,
and
i
thanked
him
and
said
good
night."
now
--
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
a
few
days
later
or
rather
two
weeks
later,
mr.
smith
met
mr.
morris,
the
alternate
juror,
mr.
morris
wasn't
on
the
home
trip
from
carson
city
to
reno
that
night
because
the
jury
had
been
out
two
days,
the
alternate
jurors
had
been
excused
so
that
mr.
morris
wasn't
riding
on
that
occasion.
and
two
weeks
later,
he
had
met
mr.
--
mr.
smith
and
mr.
morris
met
in
reno.
mr.
morris
had
by
this
time
seen
the
publications
in
the
daily
press
about
this
incident
that
had
occurred
during
the
trial,
incidentally
that
as
--
has
always
been
a
very
significant
thing.
throughout
a
three
months
trial,
the
defense
was
kept
completely
in
the
dark
about
this
contact,
the
f.b.i.
investigation,
everything
else.
but
the
deputy
united
states
marshal
knew
about
it,
and
the
press
knew
about
it
because
immediately
after
the
--
the
jury
went
out,
the
press
went
to
the
united
states
attorney
and
went
to
the
judge
and
asked
them,
what
about
this
contact
that
was
made
with
the
jury?
it
appears
that
a
lot
of
people
knew
about
it
but
certainly
the
defense
didn't
know
about
it.
now,
when
mr.
morris,
elton
morris,
the
alternate
juror
and
mr.
smith
met,
mr.
morris
had
seen
this
in
the
newspapers
and
mr.
morris
asked
mr.
smith
about
it.
and
the
question
is
--
and
the
answer
is
on
page
221
of
the
same
remanded
hearing
transcript.
question
"well,
did
mr.
smith
tell
you
that
the
man
told
him
--
mr.
leslie
c.
gillen
i
beg
your
pardon?
221,
your
honor,
of
the
--
of
the
remanded
hearing,
judge
goodman's
hearing.
the
question
was
asked,
"well,
did
mr.
smith
tell
you
that
the
man
told
him
if
he
strung
along
with
mr.
remmer
as
a
juror
in
the
case
that
he
could
make
himself
some
month
--
make
himself
a
lot
of
money."
answer
"well,
there
were
words
to
that
effect."
question
"by
the
way,
do
you
know
satterly
yourself?"
answer
"i
didn't
know
him
till
he
was
here,
don't
know
who
he
was."
and
again
on
page
222,
mr.
morris
testified.
question
"tell
me
what
he
said
that
is
in
regard
to
what
he
thought
about
mr.
satterly
approaching
him."
answer
"that
he
had
known
that
man.
that
he
joked
a
lot.”
did
he
evidently
figured
it
was
a
joke
--
that
he
evidently
figured
it
was
a
joke?
the
reason
he
took
it
to
the
judge,
he
kind
of
wondered
if
the
man
was
feeling
him
out
or
wasn't
feeling
him
out
and
he
just
wanted
to
know
what
to
do
about
it,
the
reason
he
took
it
to
the
judge."
this
was
cross-examination.
now,
i
would
like
to
answer
with
regard
to
what
my
opponent
said
about
the
curnow
act.
now,
the
curnow
incident
was
dismissed
by
judge
goodman
in
a
footnote
of
his
opinion.
but
mr.
curnow
set
a
good
deal
or
more
about
this
contacted
that
was
made
with
him
by
the
deputy
united
states
marshall,
both
in
testimony
and
in
--
in
an
affidavit
that
he
made
for
an
agent
mcgee
of
the
f.b.i.
the
--
curnow's
testimony
is
found
at
page
209
of
the
particular
testimony,
i'm
going
to
refer
to,
of
the
remanded
hearing.
he
was
asked,
"now
mr.
--
now,
mr.
curnow
did
you
say
to
mr.
mcgee,
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
agent
that
you
have
noted
that
mrs.
mack,
one
of
the
two
women
jurors
had
gone
into
the
judge's
chambers,
and
you
thought
at
the
time
mr.
boyd's
remark
therefore
concerned
her.
however,
you
later
learned
that
she
had
been
mentioning
an
illness
problem
to
the
judge,
is
that
so?"
answer
"yes."
question
"so
in
other
words,
when
mr.
boyd
talked
to
you
about
some
juror
here
being
contacted,
you
recalled
that
you
had
seen
mrs.
mack
going
into
the
judge's
chambers
and
you
thought
she
was
the
juror
who
was
approached,
is
that
correct?"
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
was
an
exhibit
taken
from
the
united
states
attorneys'
office
and
put
in
by
the
petitioner
of
this
hearing,
of
this
remanded
hearing.
and
in
that,
and
that
is
found
at
page
210
it
says,
defendant
exhibit
f
and
that
was
a
statement
taken
on
march
23rd,
1954
at
reno,
nevada
by
f.b.i.
agent
mr.
mcgee,
who
was
evidently
investigating
in
preparation
for
remand
hearing
for
the
united
states
attorneys'
office.
and
that
reads
impart,
i
was
a
juror
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
elmer
remmer.
i
did
not
at
anytime
receive
any
information
from
i.j.
smith
during
the
course
of
the
trial
that
he
had
been
approached
by
a
person
concerning
a
matter
possibly
connected
with
the
trial.
i
do
recall
that
during
the
trial
i
was
asked
by
deputy
united
states
marshal
hue
boyd,
whether
i
had
heard
of
anyone
being
contacted
that
is
anyone
on
the
juror
--
jury.
mr.
boyd
also
asked
me
whether
anyone
on
the
jury
had
discussed
anything
indicating
that
someone
on
the
jury
had
been
contacted.
i
answered
mr.
boyd
on
the
negative,
since
no
such
matter
had
come
to
my
attention.
i
--
and
then
later
in
--
in
the
same
affidavit
probably
page
211,
the
same
transcript,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
had
noticed
that
mrs.
mack
had
gone
into
the
judge's
chambers
and
i
thought
at
the
time
that
boyd's
remark
might
therefore
concern
her.
however,
i
later
learned
that
she
had
been
mentioning
an
illness
problem
to
the
judge,
so
that
mr.
boyd
and
mr.
curnow
had
discussed,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
there
had
been
an
approach
or
a
contact
with
a
juror
and
nothing
had
ever
been
done
to
negative
or
that
in
mr.
curnow's
mind
or
to
disabuse
mr.
curnow's
mind
of
what
might
have
happened.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
--
we
cannot
conceive
how
counsel
can
contend
that
the
presumption
of
prejudice
was
overcome
here
in
the
light
of
these
overt
acts
that
were
established
at
the
remand
hearing
and
that
were
presented
to
your
honors
this
morning.
we
cannot
see
how
counsel
can
distinguish
this
case
from
the
mattox
case.
and
in
our
opinion,
we
feel
that
this
case
is
more
flagrant
even
as
i
have
said
in
the
mattox
case.
the
court
will
remember
that
in
the
mattox
case,
the
matters
complained
of
was
that
where
that
the
--
that
the
bailiff
who
was
in
charged
of
the
jury,
had
apparently
in
a
friendly
way,
not
an
f.b.i.
agent
investigating
a
juror,
but
this
bailiff
had
in
a
friendly
way
advised
the
jurors
that
he
had
some
information
on
this
case
that
this
wasn't
a
first
man
that
mattox
had
killed,
that
mattox
had
killed
another
man.
now,
let
us
--
let
us
compare
that
with
what
happened
here.
a
man
approaches
a
juror
and
proposes
the
possibility
of
a
bribe.
now
as
we
said
it
didn't
take
it
as
a
joke,
despite
what
counsel
said.
he
didn't
take
it
as
a
joke
said
smith
didn't
because
he
raised
his
voice
angrily
at
this
man
that
he
knew
who
was
given
the
joking.
he
raised
his
voice
angrily.
he
fretted
about
it
for
two
days,
and
he
then
went
and
reported
it
to
the
judge
and
two
days
after
that,
an
f.b.i.
agent
was
accusing
him
about
the
thing.
the
judge
was
setting
a
motion
in
the
investigation.
the
prosecuting
attorney
was
setting
a
motion
in
the
investigation.
the
defense
was
kept
in
dark
--
in
the
dark
about
the
thing.
now,
very
closely
akin
to
the
mattox
case
is
the
contact
between
boyd
and
the
--
the
juror
curnow
and
that
of
course
was
a
remark,
not
about
something
that
the
petitioner
has
done
but
about
something
that
was
being
done
with
the
juror.
and
it's
not
unreasonable
to
believe
that,
the
only
conclusion
that
could
have
been
drawn
by
mr.
curnow
or
the
only
conclusion
that
could've
been
drawn
by
mr.
smith
was
that
any
illicit
proposal
or
any
improper
conduct
toward
the
jury
was
certainly
not
being
done
by
the
government,
it
was
being
done
by
the
defense.
that's
the
only
conclusion
that
they
could've
arrived
at.
and,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
became
--
it
became
--
insofar
as
mr.
smith
was
concerned,
it
became
most
harmful
because
of
the
reference
to
the
under
the
table
county,
the
corporation
transaction.
because
the
record
will
show,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
there
were
numerous
witnesses
testifying
right
at
the
time
that
this
was
going
on
about
cal-neva,
making
it
a
very
important
issue.
december
the
19th,
there
was
testimony
about
the
petitioner's
relation,
financial
relations
with
cal-neva.
december
the
19th,
there
was
testimony
on
that.december
the
18th,
mr.
smith
was
contacted
by
satterly.
december
the
20th,
there
was
testimony
of
that
--
about
that
commencing
at
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
the
original
transcript
of
the
trial
at
page
1599.
at
10:05
that
morning
there
was
a
--
10:05
that
morning
--
no
at
11:05
that
morning,
i
beg
your
pardon,
10:55
that
morning,
there
was
a
recess
taken,
it
is
noted
in
the
record,
and
the
shorthand
reporter's
notes
are
at
least
this
--
the
judge's
secretary's
note
showed
that
she
took
down
this
memorandum
of
mr.
smith's
visit
to
judge
foley
at
11:05
and
there
was
a
reconvening
of
the
court's
morning
session
at
11:15.
on
december
the
20th,
there
was
testimony
about
cal-neva
and
the
petitioner
on
january
the
2nd,
1952,
there
was
testimony
about
it
from
two
witnesses.
on
january
the
3rd,
there
was
testimony
about
it
from
two
witnesses.
and
on
january
the
4th,
the
day
that
--
that
judge
foley
received
the
report
from
mr.
collister,
there
was
a
day's
recess
because
one
of
the
government
attorneys
had
to
be
at
hearing
at
san
francisco.
and
on
the
following
court
day,
which
is
was
a
monday,
january
7th,
now
the
judge
had
received
the
report,
telling
them
for
the
first
time
about
this
important
issue
was
discussed
by
satterly
and
also
telling
him
that
the
investigation
showed
no
connection
between
the
defense
and
sattery.
on
january
the
7th,
there
was
further
testimony
about
cal-neva
and
also,
on
january
the
8th
and
for
practically,
every
other
day
during
the
taking
of
testimony
reference
was
made
about
the
cal-neva
transaction.
and
mr.
smith
was
hearing
that
everyday.
and
mr.
smith
was
remembering
everyday
that
satterly
said,
"i
know
this
man,
this
defendant
very
well.
he
sold
this
place
for
$850,000.
he
got
$350,000
under
the
table.
he
has
$300,000
that's
available.
why
don't
you
make
a
deal
with
him,
you're
on
the
jury?"
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
submit
that
no
reasonable
purchase
can
review
these
facts
and
say
here
there
was
presented
a
situation
which
could
not
reasonable
have
caused
either
one
of
these
jurors
to
have
a
--
a
--
an
incurable
prejudice
against
the
defendant
in
this
case
either
to
distress
and
dislike
from
what
they
thought
might
be
going
on
or
for
fear
of
their
involvement
that
they
too
should
be
charged
with
oppression.
thank
you.
