chief
justice
earl

mr.
o'brian,
when
if
we
--
if
we
decided
that
you
were
right
in
that
respect,
would
we
reach
on
to
these
other
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
decided
you
were
right
in
that
respect,
we
wouldn't
reach
these
other
questions
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
o'brian
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
suppose
you
have
disposed
of
these
trucks
through
the
chattel
mortgage
device
rather
than
conditional
sales
contract,
could
the
state
have
taxed,
the
--
the
entire
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
being
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
they
--
even
though
the
carrier
owned
--
owned
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
could
they
--
could
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
were
reasons
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
took
in
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
in
possession
of
carrier.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does
not
to
state.
and
doesn't
the
state
have
the
right
to
--
to
fix
the
priority
of
its
tax
lien?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
the
state
said
that
it
would
--
it
would
come
before
the
priority
of
the
tax
lien
would
come
before
the
--
the
seller's
mortgage
rights,
what
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
in
answer
to
justice
burton
as
i
recall
that
--
that
there
was
a
difference
between
the
two.
now,
between
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now,
my
question
is
this.
is
it
a
constitutional
difference
or
is
it
something
that
the
state
can
wipe
out,
if
it
desires
to
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
mean
this.
could
--
could
the
state
say
that,
we
will
treat
a
conditional
sales
contract
exactly
as
we
treat
a
chattel
mortgage
for
--
for
tax
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
this
being
a
--
a
conditional
sales
contract
in
this
case,
in
new
york
it
would
have
to
be
treated
as
a
chattel
mortgage.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
the
state
use
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
the
state
do
that
constitutionally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
state
doesn't
claim
to
do
that.as
i
understand
they
claim
to
tax
these
--
these
vehicles
for
the
use
that
they
make
of
their
highways.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
wouldn't
tax
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
would
have
taxed
voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
personally
if
the
--
they
wouldn't
tax
your
company
personally
if
the
--
if
the
three
trucks
were
not
--
were
not
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
tax,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
what
i
mean.
i
mean
the
distinction
between
looking
to
the
--
looking
to
the
vehicles
for
their
tax
and
looking
to
the
seller.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
trucks
are?
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
secrecy
provision
that
would
prevent
the
--
the
head
of
your
department
from
advising
them
on
inquiry,
the
amount
of
the
tax
due?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
o'brian.
