justice

what
--
what
would
be
here
--
what
would
there
have
to
be
in
here
exactly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
sure
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
i
quite
understood,
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
some
argue
that
--
some
length
about
what
the
state
law
provide
as
though
that
was
a
violation
of
state
law.
is
that
what
you
rely
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
this?
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
from
your
argument,
i
quite
understand
you.
suppose
new
york
law
had
simply
provided
that
a
tax
of
a
--a
certain
amount
should
be
imposed
on
a
carrier
for
road
purposes
and
it
should
be
a
lien
on
every
vehicle
that
was
used
on
that
road
by
that
carrier
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whoever
had
the
title
to
the
vehicle.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
say
that's
fair?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
you
haven't
had
the
title,
but
it
was
used
on
the
highway,
could
they
have
taxed
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
mean
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
company
had
--
had
the
title
for
the
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
carrier.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
have
done
that.
but
what
you
claim
is
that
because
someone
has
a
title
to
the
property,
besides
the
carrier,
new
york
could
not
attach
a
lien
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
--
on
where
it
takes
the
whole
three
vehicles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
suppose
you
have
let
the
company
use
them
and
the
state's
taxing
plan
is
to
tax
as
a
whole
in
the
aggregate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
carry
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
that
choice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
if
nothing
can
be
imputed
to
you
you're
challenging
the
right
of
the
state
to
put
a
tax
on
a
carrier,
all
the
vehicles
used
on
a
carrier's
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
same
as
to
tax
them
differently
if
you
are
own
the
title
to
the
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
are
you
a
stranger
if
you
let
your
company
be
used
by
that
carrier,
even
though
you
have
a
lien.
are
you
a
stranger
to
that
carrier
business
so
that
the
constitution
forbids
the
state
to
hold
your
vehicle
than
theirs
both
liable
for
the
total
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
suppose
nobody's
property
was
on
there
except
people
who
had
conditional
sale.
how
could
the
state
collect
the
tax
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
--
if
it
desires
to
put
a
tax
according
to
the
vehicle's
use,
that
the
vehicle
that's
--
they're
operating
on
the
road.
justice
hugo
l.
black
should
it
be
hampered
or
the
constitution
hampered
and
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
get
just
the
same,
whoever
owns
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
were
your
clients.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
--
that
they
--
happen
to
be
your
client.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
so,
most
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
have
to
be
given
in
the
statute?
i
think
you
have
a
much
shorter
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
equal
protection
requires
it
and
due
process
requires
it.
and
they
ask
it
and
did
ask
it.
and
that
put
the
question
here.
this
court
could
say
that
equal
protection
required
it
or
due
process
required
it.
have
they
asked
to
challenge
the
amount
of
tax
imposed
on
the
carrier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
issue
that's
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
don't
have
to
take
all
the
burden
you
assume.
i
don't
have
to
take
all
the
burden,
even
if
your
law
says
they
couldn't
have
notice.
that
you
couldn't
have
it.
that
can
be
raised
if
they
challenge
it
on
that
ground.
then
comes
here.
and
i
should
think
that
whether
your
statute
provides
you
or
not,
certainly,
if
due
process
provides
it
or
equal
protection
provides
it,
they're
entitled
to
get
it,
when
they
raise
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
i
have
--
the
question
i
put
was
this.
this
court
very
frequently,
unanimously
sometimes
hold
that
whether
a
statute
provides
for
notice
or
not,
it
has
to
be
given.
i
assume
from
what
you
say,
that
your
statute
does
not
specifically
provide
for
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
speaking
for
myself,
i
would
view
this
case
very
differently
but
what
he
was
asking
here
and
he
has
it
here
is
to
get
a
right
to
challenge
him,
out
of
tax
imposed
on
the
carrier.
that
would
be
one
question.
i
understood
the
question
as
quite
differently.
new
york
could
not
impose
a
tax
on
the
carrier
--
hold
this
particular
vehicles'
right
for
the
whole
tax
of
the
carrier.
now,
has
there
been
any
denial
to
the
appellants
here
of
a
right
to
challenge
--
i'm
not
talking
about
what
your
statute
says.
has
there
been
any
denial
by
the
courts
of
the
new
york
up
to
this
time
in
this
case
of
a
right
to
challenge
the
amount
of
the
tax
due
by
the
carrier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
you
get
the
position,
as
i
understand
it
on
the
authority
of
the
--
the
lockett
case
as
chief
justice
stone
wrote
that.
i've
noticed
you'd
cited,
anderson
against
lockett
