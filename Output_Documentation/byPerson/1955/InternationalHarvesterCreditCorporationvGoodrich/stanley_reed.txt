is
this
to
save
the
contract
in
here,
mr.
o'brian?
justice
stanley
reed
is
it
conditional
sale?
justice
stanley
reed
ordinary
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
and
you
--
justice
stanley
reed
but
you
--
you
agreed
to
execute
a
transfer
to
the
buyer
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
on
payment?
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
i
have
no
question
about
that.
justice
stanley
reed
it
isn't
understood.
justice
stanley
reed
--
vehicle.
justice
stanley
reed
why
--
why
do
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
owner
can't
object
to
this
tax?
justice
stanley
reed
don't
focus
to
the
international
wholly.
justice
stanley
reed
he
couldn't
come
in
and
say
this
tax
is
too
much?
justice
stanley

(voice

justice

(voice

100,000
miles
instead
of
a
50,
if
he
can
prove
that
the
50,000
miles
was
all
that
the
trucks
had
run.
justice
stanley
reed
that
international
couldn't
make
that
objection?
justice
stanley
reed
no.
justice
stanley
reed
so,
it's
the
one
--
your
going
to
against
property
and
you're
taking
it
on
a
tax
that's
twice
as
high
as
it
should
be.
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
solicitor,
i
--
i
understand
that
the
position
of
the
appellant
here
is
if
it's
perfectly
all
right
for
them
to
have
held
for
the
views
that
their
trucks
made
it
to
the
road
but
that
it
is
contrary
to
equal
protection
and
due
process
unless
they're
waiting
constitutionally.
are
you
to
charge
them
up
with
the
cause
of
the
--
what
--
of
the
tax
for
the
carriers
prior
to
the
time
that
their
trucks
went
on
the
road
or
could
they
use
during
the
time
their
truck
was
on
the
road
of
any
other
truck?
justice
stanley
reed
and
now
that
--
do
you
understand
that
that
requires,
that
the
tax
should
be
laid
on
the
particular
truck,
is
that
the
appellant's
decision?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
--
i
don't
understand
that.
i
understand
his
opposition
is
to
the
levying
on
your
--
his
--
your
trucks
of
the
tax
for
the
period
prior
to
the
time
that
he
had
a
truck
on
the
road.
justice
stanley
reed
and
your
position
is
that
this
is
a
tax
on
the
carrier
that
is
barely
measured
by
the
carrier's
use
of
trucks
and
that
you
put
a
lien
on
all
trucks
that
belong
to
the
carrier
during
--
while
it's
still
were
used
by
the
carrier
during
that
period?
justice
stanley
reed
and
how
do
you
get
the
right
to
collect
against
these
trucks,
these
three
trucks?is
there
a
provision
of
the
act
that
says
that
these
trucks
are
covered?
justice
stanley
reed
the
tax
should
be
a
joint
with
several
liability
upon
both
the
carrier
and
the
owner
of
the
truck?
justice
stanley
reed
but
if
that's
what
--
justice
stanley
reed
such
a
tax
shall
be
upon
the
carrier
except
that
where
the
carrier
is
not
the
owner
of
such
vehicular
use,
the
tax
shall
be
a
joint
in
from
several
liability
upon
both.
justice
stanley
reed
and
that
--
i
just
--
i
don't
understand
that
--
he
ruled
what?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
if
you
can't
bring
an
action
against
then
where
do
you
get
the
--
the
liability
of
the
international
harvester
trucks
for
obligations
for
taxes
that
existed
prior
to
the
time
of
their
trucks
went
there?
justice
stanley
reed
how
--
how
do
you
assess
the
tax
under
the
statute?
when
is
it
assessed?
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
stanley
reed
so
--
so,
nothing
was
--
could
have
been
assessed
against
these
three
trucks
until
they
went
into
operation?
