mr.
moore
if
the
court
please.
at
the
time
the
court
adjourned
last
night,
i
was
--
had
averted
to
the
paradox
of
this
case,
which
i
mentioned
in
the
opening
and
that
we
are
here
because
we
passed
a
tax,
the
highway
use
tax,
which
was
apportioned,
fairly
apportioned
to
the
use
of
the
highways.
now,
as
an
illustration
it
was
open
to
the
new
york
legislature
to
measure
this
tax
by
a
number
of
ways.
they
could
have
had
a
flat
fee
imposed
for
the
use
of
the
highways,
a
yearly
flat
fee.
they
could
have
a
gross
receipts
tax
measured
by
the
gross
receipts
of
the
carrier.
all
of
these
taxes
are
recognized
as
much
easier
to
administer.
now,
if
the
new
york
legislature
had
adopted
this
type
of
legislation.
it's
certainly
the
teaching
of
the
(inaudible)
case
and
the
railroad
reorganization
cases
i
cited
yesterday,
that
a
lien,
such
as
the
lien
in
question,
would
be
perfectly
valid
and
constitutional.
and
i
think
that
that
is
impliedly
admitted
in
the
appellants
brief
because
they
state
that
there
are
taxes
where
apportionment
is
not
practicable.
and
it
seems
to
be
the
rationale
here,
that
because
we
have
passed
a
tax,
imposed
the
tax
in
a
fair
way
and
apportioned
it
to
the
use
of
the
highways
that
we
have
now
lost
our
sovereign
right
to
effectively
collect
it.
and
i
don't
--
mr.
moore
well,
let
me
see
the
--
mr.
moore
well,
i
think
--
mr.
moore
let
me
use
this
illustration,
your
honor.
the
california
gross
receipts
tax
is
a
tax
based
on
the
gross
receipts
of
the
carrier.
now,
there
is
no
relation
between
that
tax
and
the
individual
use
of
the
highway
by
a
particular
truck.
mr.
moore
well,
the
analogy
i'm
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
if
we'd
had
this
gross
receipts
tax
and
we
had
asserted
our
lien
against
these
vehicles,
which
were
in
the
possession
of
the
carrier,
then
they
couldn't
come
in
and
say,
“now,
you
must
apportion
this
lien
and
assert
your
lien
only
for
that
part
of
the
tax
that
our
vehicles
were
instrumental
in
building
up,"
which
is
just
what
they
are
doing
here.
mr.
moore
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
would
characterized
the
tax
mainly
if
a
law
does
as
a
tax
on
the
carrier
measured
by
the
use
of
the
vehicles,
i
think,
there
is
some
distinction.
it
is
not
on
the
trucks
themselves
and
the
only
point
i
try
to
make
on
this
and
i'll
--
i'll
leave
it
with
this,
is
that
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
to
argue
that
a
constitutional
question
arises
because
of
the
possibility
of
apportioning
the
enforcement
of
the
tax
when
one
does
not
exist,
when
the
tax
can't
be
enforced
is
not
supported
by
the
precedence,
it's
not
supported
by
logic
and
i
don't
believe
it's
supported
by
reason
because
the
consequences
would
be
that
if
--
if
effective
enforcement
means
are
open
only
if
you
have
a
tax
which
is
not
measured
accurately
like
our
is
that
the
states
would
be
driven
to
this
other
form
of
taxation.
mr.
moore
well,
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
expresses
a
general
policy
and
i'm
coming,
that
leads
right
into
my
next
point
which
is
the
property
interest
here
affected.
i
would
say
that
it
expresses
a
policy
of
new
york,
that
new
york
will
not
recognize
a
reservation
of
legal
title
in
the
hands
of
a
person
who
puts
a
nine-ton
truck
in
the
possession
control
and
use
of
a
carrier,
that
it
will
not
recognize
that
reservation
of
title
to
defeat
its
lien
for
the
collection
of
the
taxes.
mr.
moore
i
would
say
--
mr.
moore
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
only
policy
in
new
york
is
expressed
in
the
uniform
conditional
sales
act
and
it
is
our
view
of
this
--
mr.
moore
it
--
it
has
to
be
filed
as
any
--
any
conditional
sale
is.
mr.
moore
your
--
your
honor,
it's
quite
correct
in
the
statement.
now,
turning
to
the
property
interest
here
involved,
we
come
down
to
the
point
that,
that
basically
what
this
case
comes
to
is
whether
the
action
of
the
new
york
legislature
in
cutting
off
this
reservation
of
security
title
is
an
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
action.
and
that
must
be
judged
certainly
in
the
light
of
the
people
who
are
being
cut
off
and
in
the
light
of
the
security
of
the
nature
of
the
interest
that's
being
cut
off.
now,
these
appellants
are
not
exactly
strangers
to
this
problem
of
the
highways
that
in
their
brief,
they
--
they
indicate
that
they're
better
of
if
you
have
bad
highway
systems
because
then
they
can
collect
more
money
for
newer
trucks
and
repairs.
now,
i
--
i
can't
take
that
as
a
various
serious
statement
of
policy.
the
--
the
article
they
sell
has
no
economic
value
unless
new
york
and
the
other
states
are
going
to
provide
these
highways
for
its
use.
they're
the
ones
who
put
the
carrier
in
a
position
to
incur
this
tax,
they
put
in
--
in
possession
and
control
and
use
of
the
trucks
and
they
concept
that
they
be
used
on
our
highways
to
make
earnings
so
we
can
pay
their
obligation
and
save
up
some
money
to
buy
some
more
trucks.
so,
certainly,
their
connection
with
the
problem
is
an
intimate
one.
now,
what
is
their
property
interest?
i
--
i
don't
think
we
have
any
quarrel
here
about
chattel
mortgages
or
conditional
sales.
essentially,
these
are
to
be
the
third
person,
the
third
party
in
new
york,
they're
treated
essentially
the
same.
they're
treated
as
a
security
device
and
it
is
a
limited
property
right.
i
can
see
that's
a
property
right
but
certainly,
a
limited
one.
and
what
we
have
done
here,
as
i
mentioned
before,
is
in
effect
--
merely
amend
--
put
another
restriction
into
the
conditional
sales
act
and
these
people
are
in
no
different
position
than
the
person
who
takes
saleable
goods
who
puts
them
in
the
hand
of
a
retailer.his
reservation
of
title
is
not
--
is
not
other
than
new
york
as
against
the
purchaser
regardless
of
any
filing.
now,
turning
to
analogies,
they're
certainly
nothing
new
or
noble
about
taking
the
property
of
one
person
to
pay
the
obligations
of
another,
provided
the
person
whose
property
is
taken
has
putted
by
his
own
free
will
into
this
position
which
could
be
regardless
someone
has
a
position
of
jeopardy.
your
honor
will
--
your
honors
will
recall
certainly,
many
of
the
liens,
the
all
system
of
the
strength
for
writ
which
is
now
abandoned
in
new
york,
the
innkeeper's
lien,
all
of
these
devices
cut-off
not
only
a
security
tittle
but
complete
title
to
the
property.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
best
analogy
is
the
old
agister's
lien.
under
the
old
statutes,
an
agister
was
a
man
who
owns
some
pasture.
and
when
cattle
were
placed
in
that
pasture,
he
had
a
lien
on
the
cattle
for
the
value
of
the
porridge
they
consumed
and
that
new
york,
at
least,
that
lien
was
superior
to
the
lien
of
a
prior
encumbrance,
sir.
and
the
state
here,
we
claim,
is
in
the
role
of
the
modern
agister.
their
pastures
were
on
highways,
they're
being
consumed,
the
cattle
with
the
trucks,
and
all
we're
doing
is
asserting
a
new
form
of
agister's
lien.
now,
adverting
to
the
secrecy
provisions
of
the
act,
there
is
nothing
new
or
noble
about
these.
any
tax
which
is
a
tax
so-called
“self-imposed”
where
the
tax
payer
is
required
to
file
returns,
generally
contains
some
provisions
that
employees
of
the
state
or
the
federal
government
who
have
custody
of
the
returns,
kept
divulge
business
information.
they're
in
those
returns
and
it's
passed
to
protect
this
tax
payer
and
that's
all
the
new
york
statute
provides.
now,
there's
nothing
in
the
new
york
statute
which
indicates
that
had
these
people
come
to
the
state
tax
commission
and
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
outstanding
tax
liability
that
they
would
not
have
been
informed.
now,
this
argument
is
not
a
new
one.
it
was
made
in
the
appellate
division
in
the
first
court
where
this
was
argued
in
the
analogy
of
other
new
york
statutes
which
have
been
so
interpreted
was
pointed
out.
but
more
importantly,
there
was
nothing
that
prevented
these
conditional
vendors
from
going
to
the
vendee,
who
obviously
was
anxious
to
engage
in
this
transaction,
and
requiring
him
to
provide
them
with
certified
copies
of
the
tax
returns
he
had
filed.
it
--
it
seems
from
the
statute
that
they
could
get
a
certified
copy
from
the
tax
department
of
these
returns
so
that
it
certainly
the
information
was
available
as
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller.
mr.
moore
as
--
as
we
read
the
provision,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that
the
fact,
whether
or
not
a
tax
was
due
in
the
amount
of
the
tax
could
have
been
divulged.
now,
there
isn't
any
--
i
admit
there
is
no
regulation
that
says
that
but
certainly
on
the
reading
of
this
statute
and
from
this
record
which
doesn't
--
and
on
this
record,
there
was
no
inquiry
of
any
kind.
now,
the
statute
has
since
been
amended
to
provide
four
periodic
reports
by
the
state
tax
commission
of
delinquencies.
but,
of
course,
admittedly,
this
doesn't
procure
anything.
there
may
be
delinquencies
here
that
the
state
tax
commission
doesn't
know
anything
about.
but,
finally,
in
--
in
conclusion,
there
has
been
a
restraint
placed
on
the
way
these
people
want
to
do
business.
there
has
been
a
restraint
placed
on
this
security
title
of
theirs.
it
was
a
restraint
placed
by
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
broad
power
to
collect
its
revenues.
it
was
a
restraint
but
certainly,
is
amply
warranted
by
the
report
of
this
legislative
committee
by
the
very
nature
of
the
industry
that
they
were
regulating.
and
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
the
new
york
legislature
and
they
studied
careful
act
has
going
to
unwarranted
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
thing
and
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
that's
the
position,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
appellants.
mr.
moore
i
don't
think
the
appellant
claims
that
the
tax
is
laid
on
the
truck
but
the
appellant's
position
is
that
although,
admittedly,
the
tax
is
not
on
the
truck,
it's
on
the
carrier
that
it's
measured
by
the
truck
and
since
it
would
be
possible
for
us
to
--
in
effect,
run
on
accounting
proceeding
everytime
we
wanted
to
foreclose
the
lien
that
we're
required
by
the
constitution
to
do
it.
mr.
moore
that,
that
and
also
for
any
taxes
while
he
had
trucks
on
the
road
but
they
were
measured
by
other
trucks.
that
is
his
position,
your
honor.
mr.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
that's
our
position.
mr.
moore
i
think
that's
a
correct
statement
of
the
question
your
honor.
i
would
accept
it.
mr.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
the
act
very
specifically
provides
that
--
that
any
truck
in
the
possession
of
the
carrier
that
--
that
when
it
is
used
on
the
highways,
that
a
lien
attaches
to
it
for
all
of
the
taxes.
mr.
moore
no.
there
is
no
--
we
claim
no
liability
--
mr.
moore
--
against
the
conditional
vendor.
mr.
moore
well,
that
is
the
--
the
point,
your
honor,
that
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
ruled
on
when
he
said
that
that
did
not
refer,
that
the
word
“owner”
in
there
did
not
refer
to
the
holder
of
a
security
title
like
a
conditional
vendor.
and
the
administration
of
the
tax,
there
has
been
no
attempt
--
mr.
moore
he
ruled
that
that
provision
of
the
tax
did
not
refer
to
a
conditional
vendor
and
that
there
was
no
liability
on
a
conditional
vendor
for
the
tax,
no
liability
for
the
tax.
but,
there,
of
course,
is
the
liability
we
claim
under
the
lien,
a
liability
of
his
property
subject
to
the
lien.
mr.
moore
no,
we
could
not,
your
honor.
mr.
moore
yes.
mr.
moore
we
say
that
when
international
harvester
company
put
those
trucks
in
the
possession
of
this
carrier
and
the
possession
and
control
and
use
of
this
carrier
that
they
subjected
them
to
a
lien
for
all
of
the
taxes
of
the
carrier,
which
were
then
existing,
and
for
the
taxes
that
accrued
against
the
carrier
while
he
had
them
in
his
possession.
mr.
moore
the
tax
is
assessed,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
monthly
reports
--
mr.
moore
--
filed
by
the
carrier
and
then
--
mr.
moore
not
against
the
trucks,
no,
your
honor.
but,
of
course,
nothing
is
assessed
against
the
trucks
except
against
them.
it's
assessed
against
the
carrier.
we
assert
the
lien
against
the
trucks
but
there
could
be
no
--
the
carrier
would
have
incurred
no
liability
under
the
highway
use
tax
measured
by
these
trucks
until
such
time
as
the
trucks
came
into
his
possession.
