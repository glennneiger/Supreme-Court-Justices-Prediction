mr.
o'brian,
do
you
conceive
that
if
instead
of
a
conditional
sale,
you
had
a
chattel
mortgage
arrangement
that
your
position
would
have
been
different?
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
--
the
state
(inaudible)
is
the
same
way
as
it
would
be
to
chattel
mortgage.
justice
harold
burton
but
you
insist
on
that
being
a
difference
between
the
two?
justice
harold
burton
as
i
understood
you
mr.
o'brian,
you
do
not
dispute
that
new
york
could
have
taxed
in
there,
put
a
lien
upon
your
property
or
your
vehicles
when
you
state
had
made
it
in
the
highway?
justice
harold
burton
you
object
to
the
enlarging
of
that
lien
for
the
use
of
the
other
--
justice
harold
burton
well,
at
least
theoretically
the
other
tractors
are
subject
to
the
tax
too,
aren't
they?
justice
harold
burton
at
least
theoretically,
the
other
12
--
12
tractors
are
subject
--
justice
harold
burton
--
to
the
tax?
justice
harold
burton
well,
there
--
there,
yes.
because
then
there
would
be
something
that
would
--
you'd
benefit
by
wouldn't
you.
that
the
other
trucks
that
would
be
liable
to
the
tax,
too.
justice
harold
burton
well,
that
wags
it
out,
i
understand
that.
justice
harold
burton
--
i
understand
that.
justice
harold
burton
suppose
they'd
have
--
justice
harold
burton
--
suppose
they
--
suppose
x
company
they
had
traditional
sales
through
their
contracts
on
the
other
12
trucks.
and
they'd
--
had
taken
the
excess
trucks,
instead
of
yours.
