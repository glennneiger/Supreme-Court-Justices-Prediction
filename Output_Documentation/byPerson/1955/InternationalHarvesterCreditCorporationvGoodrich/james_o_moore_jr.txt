mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
great
paradox
of
this
case
is
one
that
mr.
o'brian
hasn't
mentioned
and
that
is
that
we
are
here,
new
york
is
here,
today,
solely
because
the
new
york
state
legislature
tried
and
succeeded
in
enacting
an
equitable
highway
truck
structure
because
if
we
hadn't
set
up
this
tax
that
apportions
the
cost
and
the
burden
of
the
highways
and
the
people
who
use
it
most.
if
we
hadn't
set
up
this
apportionment,
this
claim
could
never
be
made
here
at
--
in
collecting
the
tax,
even
though
we
didn't
have
to
apportion
strictly
in
imposing
it.
the
claim
here
as
in
collecting
it
we
have
quote
about
that
apportionment.
now,
this
legislation
was
not
hastily
conceived.
it
isn't
something
that
was
improvised.
it
was
drawn
after
two
years
of
study
by
joint
legislative
committee.
and
it
was
drawn
in
recognition
of
the
problems
that
would
be
involved
in
collecting
and
administering
the
tax.
the
joint
legislative
committee
refused
to
compromise
with
equity.
they
refused
to
put
on
a
flat
tax
which
would
have
been
available
to
them
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
they
insisted
and
putting
out
a
tax
that
was
apportioned.
and
the
trouble
here
arises
right
from
that
conscious
choice.
now,
naturally
in
adopting
this
tax,
then
recognizing
the
burdens
in
collecting
it,
we
have
these
enforcement
provisions
and
we
have
this
lien
provision
which
is
here
in
dispute.
and
the
statute
makes
very
clear.
there
isn't
any
question
at
all
here
about
statutory
construction.
it
makes
very
clear
that
put
these
appellants
on
notice,
that
put
anybody
else
in
their
place
on
notice
that
the
state
was
going
to
insist
to
the
fullest
extent
on
its
lien
priority
here.
and
that
the
state
was
going
to
recognize
for
the
purpose
of
defeating
the
collection
of
the
tax
any
security
reservation
of
title.
these
appellants
knew
that
when
they
entered
into
these
transactions
and
the
statute
put
them
on
notice
of
it.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
and
it
gave
the
same
lien
priority.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
--
i
think
it
--
it
would
your
honor
as
against
anybody
who
put
the
carried
in
possession
of
property.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
new
york
state,
we
have
a
tax
right
now
which
i'm
going
to
take
up
later.
but
it's
been
our
books
for
150
years
that
the
tax
collector
of
any
county
can
seize
any
personal
property
in
the
possession
of
a
tax
debtor
that
the
owner
of
the
title
of
that
property
has
no
right
to
object
to
the
seizure.
that's
put
on
the
new
york
statute
books
for
150
years.
it's
been
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
time
and
time
again
in
the
cases
cited
on
our
brief
at
some
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
a
tax
on
the
real
property
of
a
tax
debtor
in
the
county.
he
owes
his
taxes.
he
doesn't
pay
them.
the
tax
collector
can
seize
any
personal
property
in
his
possession
which
he
can
find
in
the
county.
and
it
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
personal
property
he
seizes.
it's
--
it's
a
--
a
tax
collection
priority
which
is
well-known
to
new
york.
it's
been
upheld
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
--
i
would
say
under
income
tax
that
we
would
have
the
same
right,
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
--
i
say
yes,
your
honor,
provided
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well
--
well,
because
it
is
not
a
denial,
for
this
reason,
your
honor,
that
the
state
--
if
the
state
can
show
that
this
is
a
measure
that's
necessary
in
the
collection
of
its
revenue.
now,
i
don't
have
to
go
this
far
in
this
case
because
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
your
--
your
honor,
in
--
in
this
particular
case,
i'm
not
going
that
far
because
i
have
a
direct
connection
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would
say
there's
a
very
obvious
administrative
reason,
your
honor,
that
after
all
proceedings
to
enforce
the
tax
are
intended
to
be,
summary
proceedings
to
--
to
allow
the
state
to
have
a
prompt
collection
of
its
revenue.
that's
been
recognized
in
a
numeral
cases.
now,
if
the
state
in
--
in
a
summary
proceeding
is
going
to
be
required
to
give
notice
to
anybody
who
has
a
claim
in
this
property,
that
is
trying
to
proceed
against
summarily
why,
administratively
it's
going
to
destroy
the
whole
preceding.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
yes.
because
the
tax
is
imposed
on
the
carrier.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
oh,
i
think
it
makes
this
difference,
your
honor.
that
--
that
if
we're
taking
$5000
out
of
their
pocket,
it's
only
because
they
can't
collect
from
the
person
to
whom
they
sold
the
property.
they
can't
collect
the
debt
that
they
have
originally
entered
into.
that's
why
it's
coming
out
of
their
pocket.
we're
not
trying
to
interfere
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
say
he
can't
litigate
it,
your
honor,
because
we're
not
imposing
the
tax
on
them.
now,
it's
coming
out
of
his
pocket,
but
he
has
a
right
over
unless
he's
waived
it
against
this
person
with
whom
he's
doing
business.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
all
i
can
say
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
--
that
traditionally,
i
don't
think
that
any
of
these
tax
lien
provisions
or
certainly
none
of
the
common
law
lien
provisions
provided
for
such
notice
to
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
in
--
in
the
case
of
the
carrier
we
do,
your
honor,
although
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
say
that
the
owner
can't
--
that
carrier
or
the
owners
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
--
i
say
that
the
owner
can't,
your
honor,
because
we're
not
imposing
a
tax
on
the
owner.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
no.
that
right
is
given
to
the
person
upon
whom
the
tax
is
imposed.
now,
he
can't
come
in
and
contest
the
tax
anymore
than
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
any
other
tax.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i
would
say
this
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
--
i
think
that
international
standing
in
the
shoes
of
a
taxpayer
probably
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
--
could
make
the
objections.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
--
i
take
this
position,
your
honor.
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
right
to
protect
--
to
protest
the
tax
is
given
on
the
statute
clearly
to
the
carrier.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
right
given
specifically
in
the
statute
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well
--
well
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
no.
there's
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
no.
that
issue
was
not
here,
your
honor.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
take
the
position
here
that
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
there'll
be
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
there
is
no
such
denial
on
this
record,
your
honor.
it
comes
here
on
a
stipulated
statement
of
facts
that
raises
no
question
as
to
it.
in
answer
to
--
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
i
state
quite
frankly
that
the
statute
does
not
provide
notice.
it's
our
position
that
notice
to
this
--
to
the
carrier
is
--
is
notice
to
these
conditional
vendors
and
the
--
that
if
they
want
to
contest
the
tax
they
must
do
it
in
the
his
shoes
of
the
carrier.
that's
the
way
i
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
contradict
the
facts
in
his
--
in
his
dissent,
your
honor
at
all.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
no.
no,
sir.
well,
turning
now,
to
the
--
the
priority
question
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
great
challenge
here
as
to
the
state
sovereign
right
of
priority
has
been
recognized.
new
york's
rights
have
been
recognized
many
times
in
this
court,
in
the
marshall
case
specifically
was
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
the
marshall
case
recognized
--
cited
a
new
york
case
known
as
new
york
terminal
versus
gaus.
and
in
the
gaus
was
the
case
of
the
new
york
franchise
tax,
which
is
the
tax
on
the
privilege
of
exercising
a
corporate
franchise
in
new
york.
and
in
the
gaus
case
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
lien
--
the
lien
for
that
tax,
the
lien
and
the
property
of
the
corporation
was
a
lien
prior
to
the
prior
encumbrances
which
had
been
placed
on
that
property.
and
the
same
principle
was
followed
in
the
lower
federal
courts
in
the
reorganization
cases
involving
the
new
york
ontario
and
western
railway
company.
now,
both
--
in
both
of
those
cases
are
--
are
authority
for
the
preposition
that
--
that
where
you
have
this
kind
of
a
tax,
which
is
a
tax
really
on
the
privilege
of
using
the
highways.
that's
the
way
this
tax
is
imposed
just
as
in
the
gaus
case
there
was
a
tax
and
the
privilege
on
the
privilege
of
exercising
the
corporate
franchise
that
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
new
york
terminal
versus
gaus,
your
honor
in
204
new
york.
both
of
those
cases
held
that
the
tax
could
be
made
prior
to
the
prior
encumbrance
and
the
--
the
same
holding
has
--
has
followed.
the
--
the
holding
that
there
is
no
need
to
apportion
or
breakdown
this
tax
and
to
run
an
accounting
proceeding
every
time
you
try
to
enforce
it,
as
followed
in
many
of
the
--
the
courts
the
last
resort
of
the
state,
which
was
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
this
brings
me
to
the
point
i
mentioned
in
opening
that
the
reason
we're
here
is
that
we
set
up
this
fair
and
apportioned
tax.
this
court
has
held
that
we
were
required
only
to
arrive
at
a
rough
approximation.
and
that
the
administrative
burdens
on
the
state
might
well
justify
the
state
in
disregarding
these
key
factors
which
we
don't
disregard
in
our
tax
such
as
mileage.
now
--
so,
it
was
opened
us
to
put
on
a
flat
fee
or
the
type
of
tax
as
in
the
capitol
greyhound's
tax
and
had
we
done
that,
these
appellants
couldn't
be
here
complaining
because
as
they
themselves
admit
that
these
are
valid
taxes
which
you
can't
breakdown.
and
seemingly,
the
rationale
of
this
argument
is
because
we
have
tried
to
be
fair,
because
we
have
a
right
to
this
apportionment
that
we've
somehow
limited
our
sovereign
right
to
collect
the
tax.
and
certainly,
the
--
the
necessity
for
this
measure
has
been
upheld
by
the
new
york
courts.
it's
backed
up
by
not
only
the
presumption
of
rationality
which
this
court
will
accord.
the
new
york
legislator
is
backed
up
by
the
very
facts
surroundings
this
trucking
industry.
and
it
seems
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
which
would
indicate
that
the
act
of
the
new
york
legislator
in
adopting
this
measure
to
protect
their
revenue
was
arbitrary
act
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
if
i
can
answer
your
honor's
question.
if
we'd
had
a
flat
tax,
i
think
it's
conceded
in
the
--
in
the
appellant's
brief.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
but
if
we
had
a
flat
tax,
there
isn't
any
way
that
you
can
apportion
a
flat
tax
to
--
to
taxes
that
have
been
run
up
but
this
--
by
truck
a,
b,
or
c.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
and
--
but
--
but
we
could
assert,
certainly
our
whole
lien
for
the
whole
--
i
--
i
mean
the
state
could
assert
a
lien
on
their
one
truck
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
for
all
of
the
taxes.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
well
--
you
could
have
--
by
stating
that
way,
you
change
the
form
of
the
question?
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
don't
think
i
had
changed
it,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
no
--
no.
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
i
--
i
think
it
is
your
honor.
and
--
and
it's
our
--
our
claim
here
that
it
all
boils
down
right
to
that
but
in
--
but
--
but
that
kind
of
a
--
of
a
lien
priority
has
been
upheld
on
the
gaus
case.
it's
been
upheld
in
the
railroad
reorganization
cases
and
just
--
mr.
james
o.
moore,
jr.
that
--
that
is
quite
correct
your
honor.
in
those
cases,
it
was
not
raised
except
to
this
extent.
in
the
railroad
reorganization
cases,
the
fund
involved
was
a
fund
that
the
state
had
advanced
for
grade
crossing
elimination.
so,
if
there
had
been
any
constitutional
requirement
that
you
--
that
you
can
find
the
lien
of
the
tax
to
the
property
on
which
--
under
which
the
tax
arose
was
perfectly
feasible.
