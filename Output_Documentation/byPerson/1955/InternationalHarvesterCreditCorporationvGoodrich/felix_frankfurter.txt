would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
giving
an
illustration
of
--
of
what
would
be
if
(inaudible)
on
that
carrier
if
--
if
the
conditional
vendor
is
not,
who
would
be
an
owner
without
being
a
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
owner
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
seizing
is
suspend.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
seizing,
the
personal
property
filed,
there
were
seized
and
about
personal
property,
these
were
suspended,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
you
don't
have
a
statute
in
which
the
case
is
saying
lien
priority
not
to
(inaudible)
on
highway
tax
but
to
(inaudible)
income
tax
of
the
carrier,
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
lien
priority,
the
same
notice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they're
favored
of
income
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
everything
you
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
of
tax
in
their
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although,
the
owner,
the
lien
owner
or
the
conditional
vendor
in
my
point
of
view,
the
mortgagee,
mortgagors
couldn't
contend
to
claim
tax
which
the
tax
payer
himself
could
claim.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
tax
then
can
be
challenged,
the
validity
of
that
and
prove
that
(inaudible)
doesn't
own
it,
that
someone
puts
property
into
the
possession
of
the
taxpayer
and
have
his
property
taken
away
to
pay
for
tax
without
being
given
the
challenge
the
validity
of
that.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
it's
not
of
denial
of
legal
protection
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
it
isn't
more
necessary
in
the
case
of
a
non-taxpayer
with
the
property
being
seized
although
you
are
(inaudible)
and
in
the
case
of
a
taxpayer?
i
don't
follow
that
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
okay.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
we
shouldn't
be
--
be
(inaudible)
be
allowed
to
challenge
as
it
flashed
on
the
owner
or
the
conditional
vendor?
what
--
what
administrative
reasons
are
there,
by
the
conditional
vendor
can
challenge
in
rightfulness,
the
extent
of
the
tax
by
which
the
property
was
taken
when
the
carrier
can't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
carrier
--
the
carrier
could
protect
procedure
and
get
the
criteria
to
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
taking
$5000
out
of
that
man
is
possible.
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
the
carrier
$5000
or
the
owner
by
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
coming
out
of
their
pocket
before
you're
taking
it,
just
it
did
in
coming
out
of
the
carrier's
pocket
and
he
can
resist.
and
he
can
stop
the
--
collecting
it
and
--
and
litigate
the
question.
but
this
fellow
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
that
that
makes
any
difference
so
far
as
the
state
action
is
concerned.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned
that
the
state
is
asserting
the
power
against
him
that
our
(inaudible)
on
his
part
to
contest
it
whereas,
that
if
he
does
it
against
the
carrier,
the
carrier
can't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
do
not
know
this,
in
the
case
of
the
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
say
that
you
got
under
the
assertion
of
power
by
the
state,
the
practical
purpose
which
differentiates
between
the
carrier
and
the
owner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
want
to
be
clear
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
represent
the
state
of
new
york
and
its
law
and
we're
not
making
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
speak
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
have
to
take
the
law
as
implied
here
and
not
as
we
want
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
i
can
relate
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
follow
that
the
--
was
the
equitable
the
necessity
is
this.
(inaudible)
it
either
would
have
had
a
flat
tax.
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
you
would
have
a
tax
giving
certain
generalized
statute
which
currently
doesn't
involve
a
concern
existing,
existing
to
this
opinion
that's
legal
at
all
so
that
included
the
inescapably
on
ordinarily
of
this
kind
namely,
the
imposition
of
--
of
accumulated
arrears
on
vehicles
other
those
have
been
taxed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
how
high
it
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
that
have
a
flat
tax
in
dollar
amount
over
a
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
should
remove
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
it's
leading
to
the
same
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
problem
here
is
the
divided
monetary
interest
in
reducing
the
problem
that
that
way
there
was
a
problem.
so
far
as
i
know
that
problem
is
not
the
original
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
by
the
(inaudible)
that
the
--
that
the
interest
concentrated
is
one
person
with
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
just
say,
i
don't
understand
the
equations
you're
making
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
the
flat
tax,
no
matter
how
high
would
be
with
reference
to
the
vehicle
that
uses
the
highway.
i
don't
suppose
that
flat
tax
anywhere,
the
tax
flat
on
one
car
or
one
vehicle
for
the
use
of
the
highway
by
other
vehicles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
such
a
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
very
--
all
taxes
are
taxes
people.
we
may
speak
of
them
as
taxes
on
things
but
ultimately
a
person
is
taxed
for
something
and
a
gross
tax
on
a
carrier
is
the
most
conventional
and
obvious
kind
of
a
tax,
they
tax
this
on
gross,
subject
to
the
common
cause,
a
problem
which
we
haven't
got
or
is
the
next
(inaudible)
i
don't
see
what
they
(inaudible)
in
fairness
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
some
different
problem
to
get
it,
maybe
that
if
--
if
a
conditional
vendor
will
walk
into
your
--
put
property
in
the
possession
of
a
lessee
or
a
vendee
or
a
mortgagee
and
the
things
is
--
the
thing
is
so
intermingled
with
the
--
make
a
separation
that
that's
that,
a
status
in
the
crime
upon
imposing
a
tax
that
it
could
impose
a
valid
tax
because
intermingling
of
ownership
bars
separation.
but
here,
it
is
exquisitely
--
to
exquisitely
put
a
tax
on
vehicles,
the
use
of
the
highway
by
something
which
a
vehicle
had
no
relation
to
the
user.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
new
york
has
any
legislation
which
surrounds
upon
conditional
sales?
is
that
unequal
and
can
we
say
or
infer
that
this
expresses
a
policy
by
new
york
adverse
to
conditional
sales?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
what
i
wanna
know
is
whether
--
that's
merely
stating
another
word,
the
legal
question
in
this
case.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
there
is
any
policy
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
indicate
that
selling
the
conditional
sale
in
accordance
leads
to
abuses
because
under
cover
of
conditional
sales,
true
ownership
may
be
covered.is
there
anything
in
the
--
in
new
york
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
looks
upon
those
transactions
as
--
as
potentially
made
fair
in
this
commercial
transactions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
be
--
if
they
like
just
have
to
be
filed
or
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
roughly
speaking,
would
you
--
would
i
be
wrong
in
saying
that
new
york
doesn't
look
upon
conditional
sales
and
other
than
legitimate,
conventional,
how
many
place
commercial
transaction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
isn't
--
the
question
really
isn't
--
allow
you
to
measure
whether
(inaudible)
profiting
you
can
enforce
what
you
measure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
bring
an
action
of
debt
within
the
colloquy
or
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
what
that
ruling
means?
