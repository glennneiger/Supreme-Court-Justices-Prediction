did
you
try
to
get
the
information?
unknown
speaker
it
could
be
a
crime
to
attempt
to
get
it,
will
it?
unknown
speaker
would
be
a
crime
to
give
to
him
to
you?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
knew
there
was
lien
on
you,
whether
you
own
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
had
been
a
tax
lien
on
this
--
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
been
a
tax
lien,
when
you
bought
these
upon
this
you
--
you
would
have
been
liable
the
--
the
part
of
the
vehicles
would
have
been
liable
for
that
tax
lien?
unknown
speaker
if
there'd
been
tax
lien,
a
sale
lien.
unknown

no
--
no,
just
a
(voice

--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
before
the
--
before
you
do
that
as
there's
one
factual
thing.
unknown
speaker
your
company
is
not
carrier
--
carrier,
is
it,
the
international
credit
corporation?
unknown
speaker
you're
--
well,
the
international
credit
corporation.
unknown
speaker
it
does.
well,
it
--
it
isn't
the
case?
unknown
speaker
but
it
isn't
all
the
vehicles
of
the
credit
corporation
then
that
are
subject
to
this
lien.
it's
only
the
ones
that
were
used
on
the
new
york
roads.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
has
anything
been
seized
except
the
three
that
were
operated
on
the
road?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
those
are
the
only
three
--
unknown
speaker
--
that
have
been
seized?
unknown
speaker
but
the
--
but
not
in
your
own
name,
in
the
name
of
the
carrier?
unknown
speaker
the
lien
is
not
against
you
as
i
understand
it.
the
lien
is
against
the
three
vehicles
that
you
obtained
from
the
carrier.
unknown
speaker
your
own
three
vehicles
--
unknown
speaker
--
which
you
allowed
to
be
used
and
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
--
new
york
says
came
under
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
lien
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
--and
that's
their
only
liability.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
liability
that
your
client
has
are
the
three
trucks?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
that's
our
position.
but
that
isn't
--
unknown
speaker
oh,
new
york
claims
$3800
or
$3900.
all
the
taxes
that
accrued
against
this
carrier
and
that
is
--
but
--
that's
our
trouble.
if
this
were
a
case
where
the
tax
commission
as
it
could
have
done
under
this
statute,
when
it
came
to
levying
its
lien
have
allocated
against
us,
the
amount
of
taxes
shown
by
the
returns
filed,
this
case
would
not
be
here.
but
our
property
is
taken
to
satisfy
the
liabilities
of
someone
else,
namely,
the
carriers.
bear
in
mind,
appellees
insist
that
this
tax
is
--
is
even
now
not
on
us.
and
not
[laughs]
on
our
vehicles.
that
sounds
very
paradoxical
but
our
--
we're
like
that
(inaudible)
was
imprisoned
in
the
(inaudible)
case
where
mr.
justice
hughes,
said
whether
he
was
there
by
breach
of
contract
or
from
misdemeanor
didn't
make
any
difference
to
him
because
he
was
in
jail.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
these
theories
are.
the
cold
reality
is
that
our
property
has
been
seized
to
pay
a
tax
and
penalties
for
which
we
are
not
liable
and
which
were
incurred
by
the
carrier
and
the
reason
for
it
is
said
to
be,
the
only
justification,
is
said
to
be
this
provision
of
the
statute
about
the
lien
applying
to
all
vehicles
as
against
--
that
he
has
against
the
taxpayer.
now,
our
view
is
this.
that
the
--
the
state
could
seize
only
the
--
only
the
interest
that
the
carrier
had
in
these
vehicles.
he
had
the
right
under
any
theory
to
use
in
possession,
whether
we
retain
the
title
or
not.
all
that
he
had
under
the
conditional
sale
contract
was
the
right
to
use
them.
but
instead
of
seizing
that
right
and
undertaking
to
settle
that
right
they
--
they
have
seized
the
property
of
the
creditors.
now,
may
i
call
attention
to
the
question
of
what
this
lien
is?
because
that
is
--
that
is
something
on
which
there
is
a
sharp
difference
of
opinion.
i'm
not
stopping
to
distinguish
those
cases
where
it
meant
--
meant
innocent
parties
have
been
--
have
been
caught
in
the
toils
of
the
law
because
they
permitted
their
--
their
vehicles
to
be
loaned
and
used
for
illegal
purposes.
and
i'm
not
stopping
to
distinguish
the
cases
where
a
public
policy
as
declared
by
the
legislature
has
made
special
exceptions.
but
this
a
case
where
there
was
no
benefit
to
us
and
therefore
no
lawful
tax
could
have
been
imposed,
constitutionally,
except
for
the
use
of
our
trucks.
now,
note
--
note
what
this
--
note
what
this
lien
is,
if
this
lien
--
this
lien
is
a
caveat.
statute
says,
the
lien
shall
attach
at
the
moment
the
vehicle
goes
upon
the
highway.
and
we're
quite
familiar
with
the
rules
of
law
which
hold,
as
i
have
said,
that
where
a
tax
is
impose
of
an
inchoate
character
like
that
and
later
on
it
becomes
fixed
in
a
mound,
then
that
dates
back.
now,
we
don't
contest
that
in
this
case,
but
here
was
a
secret
lien.
this
lien
and
i
think
i
speak
advisedly.
this
lien
was
not
--
unlike
that
lien
of
the
collector
of
internal
revenue.
those
liens
have
been
so
often
before
the
courts.
those
are
liens
where
the
collector
files
a
liquidated
claim
and
he
files
it.
he's
required
by
law
to
file
it.
now,
in
this
case,
this
lien
was
not
required
to
be
filed
anywhere.
it
was
what
justice
cardozo
called
in
the
maclay
case
a
caveat.
it
was
noticed
that
if
that
they
take
--
that
if
the
carrier
that
--
that
it
was
noticed
that
if
the
carrier
did
not
pay
his
taxes,
then
this
would
become
a
liquidated
lien.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
of
these
--
of
these
tractors,
i
go
back
to
that,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
the
right
of
the
carrier
has
been
extinguished
in
this.
the
appellants
were
the
--
now
the
legal
--
now
the
legal
owners.
now,
this
lien
is
in
short
a
sort
of
a
cloud
on
title.
it
--
its
floating
there.
if
the
man
pays
his
bills,
there
is
no
lien.
it's
--
it's
in
the
area.
it's
noticed
that
there
may
be
a
lien
literally.
and
in
--
in
that
case
the
--
in
--
in
--
and
--
and
there
you'll
have
a
situation
where
the
--
the
purpose
of
a
lien,
the
traditional
lien,
the
common
law
lien,
the
purpose
of
a
lien
was
to
give
notice
to
a
purchaser
or
a
--
or
an
interested
party
that
there
was
a
lien.
so
that,
and
this
all
important,
he
might
go
to
the
recording
office
or
the
assessment
office
or
the
state
tax
commission
and
ascertain
whether
there
was
a
liquidated
lien.
but
in
this
case,
and
i
keep
emphasizing
it,
the
state
itself
made
that
impossible
because
it
made
it
a
crime
to
disclose
anything
about
--
about
this
delinquency.
now,
it's
significant,
i
think,
in
that
connection,
although
not
at
all,
of
great
importance,
that
the
legislature
of
this
last
year
following
the
opinion
below,
in
this
case,
has
added
a
clause
to
the
secrecy
provision
and
of
which
authorizes
the
state
tax
commission
periodically
to
print
lists
of
tax
delinquents
under
this
statute,
so
that
men
can
now
ascertain.
but
the
lien,
and
my
point
is,
in
this
case
owing
to
these
peculiar
facts,
the
lien
was
legally
ineffective
as
against
the
property
right
of
--
of
these
appellants.
