mr.
john
lord
o'brian
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
having
been
noted
by
this
court
last
october.
it
involves
a
controversy
between
the
appellants
who
were
manufacturers
of
tractors
and
motor
vehicles
and
the
action
of
the
state
tax
commission
in
levying
what
is
called
colloquially,
the
highway
use
tax
of
new
york
city.
the
parties
submitted
their
dispute
by
a
stipulated
case
in
accordance
to
the
new
york
practice
to
the
appellate
division
of
the
third
department
which
--
which
it
decided
against
the
--
the
appellants
and
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court,
the
majority
of
the
court
wrote
no
opinion
but
affirmed
one
judge,
judge
van
voorhees,
dissenting
in
an
--
a
short
and
very
strong
opinion
which
is
part
of
the
transcript
of
record
before
you.
the
--
if
i
may
briefly
state
the
facts
instead
of
the
question
at
law
the
furthest,
i
think
i
can
make
it
relatively
clear
and
also
narrow
the
issues.
these
appellants,
i
make
no
distinction
between
them,
the
international
harvester
company
and
the
brockway
company
are
the
same
both,
what
i
i
say
for
one
applies
to
the
other.
as
the
international
credit
company
here,
harvester
credit
company,
is
merely
the
assignee
of
the
rights
of
the
harvester
company.
it's
a
--
it's
a
finance
corporation.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
here.
in
the
spring
of
1953,
the
--
these
two
companies
sold
to
the
eastern
carting
company
three
tractors,
international
sold
two
and
brockway
one.
these
tractors
are
the
motored,
the
motor
vehicle
that
hitch
on
to
the
trailers
and
tow
them.
and
at
that
time
each
of
these
vendors
took
a
--
took
a
conditional
sales
contract
after
a
down
payment.
and
those
contracts
were
recorded
as
required
by
law.
and
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
anywhere
of
lack
of
good
faith
on
the
part
of
anybody.
the
--
that
was
in
february
and
march
of
1953,
that
these
vehicles
were
purchased.
in
the
following
january,
the
eastern
carting
company
having
before
them
on
all
of
these
contracts,
the
appellants
exercising
their
rights
under
the
contract
replevied
their
--
their
tractors.
that
was
in
accordance
with
the
legal
procedure
provided.
they
were
sold
at
public
auction
bid
in
by
the
two
appellants.
the
international
company
immediately
resold
its
tractors.
one
to
a
massachusetts
corporation,
which
ceased
to
have
anything
to
do
with
new
york,
the
highways.
the
other,
too,
was
connected
to
the
corporation.
brockway
still
had
possession
of
it.
this
--
this
replevin
then
took
place
in
--
in
january,
in
a
--
i
beg
you
pardon,
january
22nd
of
1954.
april
21st
following
that,
the
state
tax
commission
for
the
first
time
gave
notice
that
it
was
attaching
under
its
--
under
the
lien
provided
by
statute
all
three
or
two
of
these
--
two
of
these
tractors
and
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
third.
it
being
the
contention
and
the
--
the
state
tax
law
and
i
can
narrow
this
proceeding
somewhat,
this
highway
tax
law,
in
the
case
before
you,
presents
no
question
of
the
right
of
the
state
to
levy
the
tax
in
the
--
measured
in
the
way
that
it
is
measured
in
the
statute.
that
is
to
say,
there's
as
in
addition
to
other
taxes,
this
tax
shall
be
from
the
carrier
except
where
the
carrier
is
not
the
owner
of
such
vehicular
unit
and
the
tax
shall
be
joined
and
--
and
i
beg
your
pardon,
where
the
carrier
is
not
the
owner,
the
tax
should
be
joined
in
several
liability
upon
both
the
owner
and
the
carrier.
this
tax
is
based
on
the
gross
weight
of
each
particular
vehicle
and
the
number
of
miles
it
is
operated
on
the
public
highways
in
this
state
and
so
forth.
the
tax
for
each
vehicle
shall
be
computed
by
multiplying
the
number
of
miles
operated
on
the
public
highways
in
the
state
by
the
appropriate
weight
group.
that
is,
these
are
tractors
of
more
than
18,000
pounds.
when
an
vehicular
--
well
i
will
not
read
the
rest
of
it
because
it
doesn't
apply
to
it.
now,
the
next
section
provide
how
this
tax
is
to
be
paid
--
is
to
be
paid.
there's
no
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
the
--
the
first
section
of
this
statute.
we
raise
no
question
of
the
validity
of
the
way
the
tax
is
to
be
measured
or
its
fairness.
but
when
it
comes
to
the
payment
of
the
tax
then
our
controversy
arises.
at
the
time
of
filing
a
return,
that
is
once
a
month,
as
required
by
this
article,
each
carrier
shall
pay
the
tax
commission,
the
tax
imposed
for
a
period
covered
by
the
return.
the
regulation,
the
company
regulation
provide
--
that's
in
detail,
how
that
is
to
be
done.
the
form
of
the
return
should
be
filed
once
a
month.
and
the
tax
shall
be
due
and
payable
at
the
time
of
filing
the
return
and
so
forth.
now
then,
the
fees,
taxes,
penalties
and
interest,
accruing
under
this
article
shall
constitute
a
lien
upon
all
motor
vehicles
and
vehicular
units
of
each
such
carrier.
the
lien
shall
attach
at
the
time
of
the
operation
of
any
motor
vehicle
or
vehicular
unit
of
such
carrier
within
the
state
and
it
shall
remain
effective
until
the
fees,
taxes,
penalties
and
interest
are
paid
or
the
motor
vehicle
is
sold.
such
liens
--
that
this
where
our
dispute
arises.
such
liens
--
well
that's
a
lien
for
all
the
taxes
of
the
carrier,
not
--
not
the
taxes
on
our
particular
unit.
this
carrier
operated,
it
is
stipulated,
15
of
these
vehicles
at
--
at
this
time.
except
the
law
says
such
lien
shall
be
paramount
to
all
prior
liens
or
encumbrances
of
any
character
and
to
the
rights
of
any
holder
of
the
legal
title
in
or
to
such
motor
vehicle
or
vehicular
unit.
now,
the
--
the
case
as
presented
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
is
--
is
a
case
presented
on
the
theory
of
lien
priority,
the
state
having
enacted
this
statute.
the
appellees
that
take
the
position
that
that
lien
is
paramount
to
all
other
rights
in
these
vehicles.
our
position
is
a
very
simple
one,
that
shocking
as
it
may
sound,
our
vehicles
have
been
seized.
our
property
interest
in
our
vehicles
have
been
seized
to
pay
the
total
liabilities
of
a
carrier
for
the
highway
use
taxes,
penalties
and
interest
for
which
we
are
not
liable,
have
not
been
liable
and
could
not
be
liable
under
the
statute.
now,
the
reason
from
my
making
this
last
statement
in
this
form
is
this.
this
statute
contained
another
section,
which
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
here,
providing
that
the
--
in
those
instances
where
the
carrier
is
not
the
owner
of
the
vehicle.
the
owner
may
file
the
return
on
his
own
behalf
and
--
and
maintain
the
records
required
by
the
statute.
and
he
shall
be
jointly
and
severally
liable
with
the
carrier
for
the
payment
of
the
tax.
now,
the
first
anomaly
here
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
ruled
in
a
formal
opinion,
which
is
quoted
in
the
briefs
of
both
of
the
parties
here,
has
ruled
that
the
holder
of
a
--
that
a
conditional
vendor,
which
we
were
originally
here,
is
not
an
owner.
and
that
he
is
not
liable
for
the
payment
of
the
tax
nor
is
he
permitted
to
file
under
this
section,
the
necessary
documents
which
would
clear
away
any
lien
on
the
vehicle.
that
is
the
first
element
in
this
case
that
gives
singularity
to
it
and
takes
it
a
little
out
of
the
--
takes
at
the
great
deal
out
of
the
ordinary.
now,
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
that's
one
of
the
question.
[laugh]
we've
been
trying
to
secure
an
answer
for
from
the
commission,
your
honor.
the
--
under
the
new
york
law,
frankly,
a
conditional
vendor
is
the
holder
of
a
security
interest
and
the
case
of
the
tax
commission
is
based
on
the
theory,
i
think
you
will
find,
that
a
--
that
there
are
just
two
liens,
one
of
the
state
and
one
of
the
conditional
vendor.
therefore,
the
state
is
given
priority
by
law
and
that's
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
case.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
there's
no
owner
at
all
in
this
--
in
this
--
in
that
--
in
that
situation.
that's
one
of
the
anomalies.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
now,
the
other
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
beg
your
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
there's
another
element
in
this
case.
after
we
--
you'll
notice
that
as
already
said,
i
hope
you'll
notice,
that
after
we
replevined
our
property
and
we
were
now
in
the
position
of
having
recovered
our
property
and
being
the
sole
owners
of
the
property
before
the
state
took
any
action
to
perfect
its
inchoate
lien.
now,
we're
perfectly
familiar
with
the
cases
which
hold
that
where
an
inchoate
lien
attaches,
it
--
it's
dated
back
to
the
--
when
this
is
liquidated
to
the
time
when
--
when
the
lien
first
acquired.
we
--
we're
perfectly
well-acquainted
with
those
cases
and
i'm
not
trying
to
put
them
to
one
side.
but
in
this
case,
the
appellees
say,
secondly,
that
we
had
imputed
knowledge
of
this
statute
and
that
these
appellant
took
--
wanted
to
take
the
risk
of
selling
their
--
their
tractors
on
a
conditional
sale,
knowing
that
this
statute
undertook
to
place
a
lien
upon
all
vehicles
owned
by
the
carrier.
then
--
or
operator,
that
i
should
say
by
the
carrier.
then
we
were
put
on
notice
and
we
are
held
to
the
doctrine
of
implied
consent.
now,
right
in
this
connection
comes
the
second
thing
on
--
on
this
question
of
who
owned
this
property,
may
i
--
may
i
quote
from
the
appellees'
brief.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no,
it
is
not.
but
there's
no
disagreement
between
the
parties.
it's
some
ordinary
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
that
with
the
title
was
reserved
in
the
--
in
the
vendor
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--until
the
property
is
fully
paid
for.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes
--
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
--
i
think
that's
correct
you
using
my
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
the
--
now,
let
me
call
attention
to
the
third
peculiarity.
in
our
prayer
we
find
ourselves
in
this
case.
this
is
not
a
prior
lien
case
at
all.
the
cold
reality
is
that
we
are
here
today
with
our
property
seized.
our
property
interest,
will
you
call
it
a
conditional
vendor's
right
or
whether
you
call
this
the
reservation
of
title
or
what
not,
it
was
what
is
concededly
on
this
record
over
$5000.
and
it
was
seized
and
has
appellees
brief
state
here,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
imposition
of
a
tax
upon
the
appellants
or
upon
the
trucks,
which
the
appellant
--
in
which
the
appellants
held
a
security
interest.
the
new
york
highway
use
tax
is
imposed
upon
the
carrier,
eastern,
and
as
construed
by
the
attorney
general,
the
appellants,
as
conditional
vendors,
have
no
liability
for
the
payment
of
eastern's
taxes.
but
here,
we
are
with
our
property
seized
and
the
taxes
by
the
way
which
are
included
in
the
claim
against
us,
include,
as
stipulated
here,
the
taxes
measured
by
the
use
of
our
three
particular
vehicles
which
is
--
which
is
all
right.
secondly,
these
taxes
in
--
in
of
the
--
this
liabilities,
let
me
say,
include
taxes
incurred
by
the
carrier
by
the
use
of
vehicles
other
than
these
three
others,
his
other
12
vehicles
used
the
roads
in
this
period.
and
they
also
include,
the
taxes
incurred
for
periods
both
prior
to
our
sale
of
the
trucks
to
eastern
and
subsequent.
in
fact,
these
taxes
as
stipulated
include
a
year
--
a
year
that
use
of
other
trucks
before
our
trucks
were
sold
at
all.
and
the
taxes
in
--
then
that
they
include
also,
of
course,
the
subsequent
taxes.
but
the
--
but
in
this
connection,
we're
not
only
being
coerced
to
pay
these
taxes.
many
of
us
pointed
out
the
dissenting
opinion
below,
the
bulk
of
which
were
accrued
to
the
carrier
before
we
ever
saw
that
carrier.
now,
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
set
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
think
a
conditional
sale
is
--
is
stronger
position.
but,
your
honor,
that
very
question
has
been
discussed
[laugh]
a
--
a
great
deal
without
conclusion.
that
justice
cardozo
in
the
maclay
case
raised
up,
or
conjured
up
quite
a
number
of
those
refinements
of
the
difference
in
essence
between
different
kinds
of
liens,
judgment
liens,
mortgage
liens,
chattel
mortgage
liens.
and
then,
if
i
may
use
aa
an
expression
of
the
man
i
admire
very
much,
he
threw
up
his
hands
and
said
it
was
unnecessary
in
that
case
to
get
into
all
these
refinements.
so
that
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
exactly.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
and
i
also
--
i'll
speak
on
-
of
this
point
later,
pardon
me.
i
also
claim
that
at
the
time
the
state
undertook
its
--
to
impose
its
lien,
you
see
the
state
waited
22
--
27
months.
and
then
for
the
first
time,
these
appellants
learned
that
the
carrier
owed
back
taxes.
now,
the
other
singular
feature
--
i
don't
like
--
keep
using
this
word
but
it
is
a
singular
feature,
is
this.
under
the
new
york
statute,
this
--
this
very
statute,
new
york
state
forbad
any
information
in
regarding
to
--
to
tax
delinquencies
under
this
statute
or
tax
liens
under
this
statute
or
any
information,
whatever
related
to
the
--
the
--
to
the
tax
imposed,
it
forbad
the
disclosure
and
made
it
a
crime
for
any
person
connected
with
--
with
this
collection
in
an
official
capacity
to
disclose
to
anybody,
except
the
owner.
so
that
we
--
so
that
here
is
something
entirely
new
in
tax
law.
here
is
the
state
by
--
we
are
told,
for
example,
that
we
are
put
on
notice.
here,
you
--
you
know
that
this
lien
was
provided
by
statute
and
yet
you
sold
your
trucks.
well,
you
consented
to
what
just
has
happened
since.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
the
record
is
silent
on
that
but
it
--
but
it
--
i
think
we
may
--
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
our
opponents
that
we
--
we
do
not
show
that
we
attempted
to
get
it.
but
it
was
a
crime.
it's
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
don't
know.
but
bear
in
mind,
your
honors,
that
there
is
no
reason
for
the
appellants
to
suspect
that
there
are
any
unpaid
taxes
here,
until
the
day
that
they
knew,
they
were
properly
received.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
i
want
to
discuss
that
question
of
lien
separately,
pardon
me,
in
just
a
moment,
your
honor.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no.
we
raised
an
old
question.
for
example,
let
me
narrow
this
issue
further.
i've
already
said
that
this
case
is
not
like
the
capitol
greyhound
case
or
these
cases
where
it's
difficult
to
break
down
--
break
down
taxes
and
--
and
allocate
taxes.
so
that
your
court
certainly
is
very
familiar
with
all
of
those
cases.
that
isn't
this
kind
of
a
case
in
this
case,
under
the
regulation
of
the
tax
commission
itself,
the
--
the
owner
was
obliged
to
file
each
month,
a
statement
for
each
vehicle
that
he
operated,
identifying
the
vehicle,
giving
the
date
of
the
trip,
the
permit
and
the
vehicle
numbers,
the
destination,
the
number
of
miles
traveled
each
day.
can
the
stat
and
the
regulations
then
provide?
this
is
in
--
in
our
reply
brief
to
this
appendix.
that
at
the
end
--
that
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
files
his
return,
he
totals
for
each
vehicle
separately,
how
far
it
has
traveled.
so
that
at
the
time
the
--
time
the
tax
commission
seized
our
property,
they
had
in
their
possession
a
complete
and
accurate
statement,
presumably
it's
accurate,
of
what
use
have
been
made
on
the
highway
of
our
vehicle
and
that
is
open
to
them
to
tax
that
and
when
they
came
to
imposing
their
lien.
they
were
confronted
with
no
difficulty
so
far
as
allocating
the
part
of
the
lien.
we
frankly
concede
that
although
we
did
not
operate
these
trucks
of
ours,
that
--
that
we
may,
that
the
lien
may
be
fairly
enforced
against
us
for
the
use
of
our
own
trucks.
but
that
isn't
this
case.
this
case
involved
not
only
all
the
back
taxes
on
the
other
trucks,
but
it
includes,
as
stipulated,
something
over
$500
in
penalties
that
were
assessed
against
the
carrier
because
he
had
filed
incorrect
returns
or
he
had
filed
no
returns.
in
other
words,
penalties
for
a
misbehavior
of
the
carrier
--
carrier
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
tax
earned
by
the
use
of
the
highway.
and
so,
we
are
presented
--
were
presented
with
that
situation.
and
bear
in
mind,
the
attorney
general
has
ruled
that
we
are
not
liable
for
any
of
these
taxes
by
a
sort
of
a
mystic
of
the
word
“lien”.
this
is
converted
into
a
--
a
liability
against
us
for
growing
out
of
something
we
couldn't
have
been
liable
for
except
these,
our
three,
the
use
of
our
three
vehicles
might
have
justified
it.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
it
--
its
--
pardon
me?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
oh,
well,
now
wait
a
minute.
i
--
i
beg
you
pardon
--
pardon
me.
but
if
this
were
a
--
a
general
judgment
or
something
of
that
sort
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
a
--
a
general
tax.
now,
this
tax,
bear
in
mind,
is
a
specific
tax
for
the
use
of
the
highways.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
that
and
the
tax
law
itself
declares
the
purpose
of
it
by
declaring
that
the
purpose
of
this
tax
is
to
provide
revenue
for
the
maintenance
of
the
highway
and
to
collect
these
taxes
from
the
persons
who
most
benefit
from
them,
namely
the
heavy
truck
owners.
so
that
--
let
me
turn
back,
if
i
may,
to
the
question
of
the
tax
itself.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no.
well,
it's
the
international
harvester
company,
no.
we're
manufacturers.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
that
--
that's
just
an
ancillary
finance
corporation.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no
--
no.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no,
there
--
it's
all
three.
let
me
put
it
this
way.
these
appellants
had
three
tractors.
they
were
used.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
the
carrier
had
12
more
tractors
and
he
been
operating
the
whole
fleet
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
without
paying
any
taxes
on
them.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
and
now,
our
property
is
seized
to
pay
those
tax
liabilities
incurred
by
the
carrier
although
neither
of
these
appellants
ever
operated
a
--
a
truck
on
the
roads.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no.
those
are
the
only
ones
that
belong
to
us.
those
are
the
ones
we
replevied.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
we're
--
we're
--
they
are
seized
and
we're
assessed
the
total
liability
for
all
of
these
taxes
that
have
accrued
back
as
far
as
january
of
1952.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
oh,
no.
well,
that
those
taxes
were
levied
against
the
tax
but
the
lien
and
the
liability
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.our
--
our
own
three
vehicles,
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
that
is
correct.
now,
our
primary
contention
is
that
--
that
entirely
apart
from
this
statement
of
the
attorney
general,
we
could
not
have
been
made
liable
for
these
--
for
these
taxes
as
conditional
vendors
because
we
didn't
use
the
highways.
it
is
true
that
we
consented
to
the
use
of
our
trucks,
but
we
--
we
did
not
use
the
truck
in
the
highways.
and
no
benefit,
going
back
to
the
old
rule
that
no
man
may
be
required
to
pay
a
tax
where
there
is
no
benefit
that
accrues
to
it.
there
was
no
benefit
to
us
in
--
in
the
legal
sense
except
that
it's
a
part
of
appellees,
i
think,
weekly
assert
that
our
trucks
had
a
market
because
they
could
be
used
on
the
highways
and
therefore
there
was
some
relationship.
there
was
no
relationship
between
these
appellants
and
the
carrier
aside
from
the
sale
of
those
trucks.
that's
the
only
connection
with
this
whole
of
a
liability,
the
fact
that
three
of
their
trucks
were
in
his
position.
now,
let
me
turn
if
i
may
to
the
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
now,
new
york
doesn't
claim
anymore
does
it?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes,
sir.
except
i
wouldn't
called
it
enlarging
of
the
lien.
we
--
we're
being
tax,
bear
in
mind,
the
attorney
general
said
we're
--
we're
not
liable
for
this
tax.
we
--
we
answer
that,
he
says
as
a
conditional
vendor
we're
not
liable
for
this
tax.
but
our
property
is
seized
for
the
purpose
of
paying
this
tax.
that
--
that's
the
nub
the
case.
and
--
but
now,
it
will
be
said
that
well,
after
all,
you
have
notice
of
this
tax.
you
might
have
known
there'd
be
some
tax.
all
you're
complaining
about
is
that
the
tax
is
larger
than
you
thought
it
would
be.
that
is
not
our
case.
we
say
that
this
tax
must
have
a
foundation
in
law.
that
there
was,
except
for
our
three
vehicles,
there
was
no
relationship
between
us
and
the
circumstances
that
gave
--
gave
rise
to
this
tax.
now,
it
will
also
be
urged
that
it
vested
the
state
tax
commission
to
say,
how
this
should
be
levied.
and
they
take
the
position
that
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
this
is
the
way
the
tax
should
be
levied,
all
put
into
one
ball
of
wax
and
--and
assessed.
we
say
that
cannot
hold.
that
--
that
is
not
legal
as
against
us.
that
they
can't
do
that.
there's
nothing
in
this
statute,
may
i
emphasize,
either
that
would
prevent,
if
you
read
and
interpret
the
state
tax
commission,
when
it
came
to
enforcing
its
lien
against
the
(inaudible)
that
--
that
these
are
problems.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
would
or
have
prevented
that
from
charging
us
the
correct
amount
of
--
of
our
taxes.
but
that
isn't
what
they
did.
and
i
keep
--
i
keep
repeating
that
and
perhaps
too
much.
in
other
words,
we
say
the
state
neither
the
state
nor
the
tax
commission
have
the
power
to
impose
on
us
a
liability
that
concededly,
that
incurred
against
another
and
compel
us
to
pay
the
full
amount
of
that
liability
for
no
other
reason
than
that
at
one
time
we
sold
three
trucks
under
vendor's
--
under
vendor's
contract.
and
so
far
as
being
given
notice
to
this
concern,
i
have
already
referred
to
that.
the
doctrine
of
imputation
of
knowledge
does
not
apply
in
this
case
because
all
the
knowledge
that
was
given
us
was
notice
that
there
would
be
a
lien
and
unless
taxes
were
paid.
we
--
and
--
and
the
state
did
not
liquidate
its
claim
until
after
we
became
the
sole
owners
of
--
of
the
property.
now,
the
--
there's
one
other
feature
of
this
which
--
which
i
think
goes
perhaps
to
the
looseness
of
the
statute
itself
and
may
explain
something
of
what
has
happened
here.
this
statute
carries
with
it
the
regulations
made
by
the
tax
commission.
the
tax
commission
in
addition
to
the
--
what
i
have
read
as
to
how
returns
should
be
made
and
the
separate
milage
and
the
separate
tax
assessed
against
each
vehicle.
in
addition
to
that,
the
--
the
tax
commission
provides
that
before
the
tax
commission
can
proceed
to
enforce
its
rights
against
the
carrier,
i'm
talking
about
the
eastern,
they
must
give
him
notice.
they
must
assess
the
tax.
they
must
give
him
notice.
they
must
--
they
must
give
him
notice
of
any
--
they
must
propose
sale.
they
must
give
him
a
hearing.
and
the
statute
also
provides,
as
you
will
see
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
that
so
far
as
our
carrier
concerned,
he
is
also
given
a
specific
right
of
court
review.
not
one
of
those
protective
rights
is
given
us
under
this
statute
on
the
theory,
apparently,
that
we're
merely
--
we're
merely
conditional
vendors
who
merely
hold
the
title
to
this
problem.
we
have
no
review.
we
have
never
had
had
a
hearing.
we
never
had
a
notice
and
--
and
over
and
beyond
that
the
--
if
we
pay
this
tax
under
this
coercion,
we
have
no
right
over
against
anyone
by
first,
the
legal
procedure
taken
in
good
faith
and
in
ignorance
of
the
existence
of
these
statutes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
of
--
of
what
came
out
of
these
taxes,
for
example.
it's
entirely
conceivable
that
the
argument
about
that
we're
presenting
here
have
been
made
through
the
tax
commission
at
the
time,
a
different
result
would
have
been
to.
but
i
think,
your
honor,
in
speaking
of
due
process,
where
a
man
is
being
subjected
to
a
liability,
there
must
be
some
element
of
due
process.
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
that
there
was
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
i
said
that
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no.
i
am
relying
on
the
fact
that
it's
pointed
out
in
dissenting
opinion
below.
this
was
a
violation
of
due
process,
substantive
due
process
in
that
our
property
has
been
confiscated.
now,
the
reason
i
won't
use
the
word
“confiscated”
is
that
we
have
no
right
over
against
anyone.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
that's
virtually
what
this
statute
says.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
i
say
that
under
the
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
you
mean
the
carrier?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
oh.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
it
could
attach
a
lien
to
it
for
the
use
of
that
particular
vehicle.
now,
i'm
--
i'm
--
perhaps
i
better
restate
this.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
make
--
we
make
no
--
no
question.
but
that
as
to
the
three
vehicles
which
we
sold,
knowing
there
it'd
be
used
on
the
road,
that
we
make
no
question
that
we
can
be
lawfully
required
under
a
lien,
the
lien
to
pay
that
tax.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
because
it's
levied
on
the
use
of
--
of
the
three
vehicles.
that
is
to
say
the
state
can
enforce
that
lien
against
our
three
vehicles
against
us.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
that
cannot
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
that
cannot
be
done
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
that
cannot
be
done
constitutionally.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
benefit
that
can
--
or
opportunity
in
the
language
of
the
cases
that
can
be
imputed
to
us
by
the
use
of
those
13
other
tractors.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
disputing
the
right
of
the
state
to
tax
the
carrier
--
the
carrier.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
if
they
undertake
to
impose
a
lien,
that
lien
against
us,
a
stranger
they
must
on
our
theory,
allocate
against
us
the
amount
of
that
tax.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
our
theory
is
that
even
as
against
the
carrier,
the
state
would
be
confined
to
the
carrier's
property
right
in
that
property.
that
is,
he
had
the
right
to
possession
and
use
of
the
property.
but
in
this
case
they've
seized
the
whole
property
of
the
creditor.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
there
are
other
methods
by
which
it
can
collect
tax
that's
besides
this.
i
mean
in
--
under
the
regulation.
these
people
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
i'll
put
it
--
may
i
put
it
the
other
way?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
by
the
way
--
by
the
way
around.
we
--
we
sold
these
trucks.
and
as
you
say
we're
put
on
notice
in
the
status
of
a
lien
that
for
any
--
there
would
be
a
lien
for
any
unpaid
taxes.
now,
insofar
as
the
carrier
is
concerned,
that's
a
matter
of
no
concern
to
us.
it's
(inaudible)
to
levy
on
all
of
his
vehicles
for
all
of
his
taxes
but
they
cannot
levy
on
us.
our
only
property
right
was
in
these
three
vehicles.
and
we
hold
the
title
to
these
vehicles.
and
instead
of
the
--
and
--
and
we
liquidated
the
title.
we're
the
sole
owners
now,
today.
today
this
--
this
lien
is
served
after
all
of
these
things
been
going
through
with
it.
can
the
state
come
in
and
arbitrarily
tax
us
for
all
the
liabilities
and
all
the
penalties
for
misbehavior
that
the
carrier
has
incurred
under
the
statute?
no.
because
these
--
all
taxes
must
have
a
basis.
the
basis
as
was
held
by,
your
honor,
in
many
of
my
(inaudible)
of
this
court
in
capitol
greyhound's
case
for
example.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
those
are
owned
by
the
carrier.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
pardon
me,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
the
point
i've
been
trying
to
make.
if
we
pay
this
tax
under
this
coercion
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
he
can't
sue
anybody.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
we
can't
sue
the
tax
commission.
we
can't
sue
the
--

no

mr.

well,
that
wasn't

worst
of

course.

mr.

they

mr.

yes.
that's
quite
so,
your
honor.
that's
usually
the
case
i
think
in
this
court.
mr.
john
lord

my
chief
interest
in
this
is
my
client,
sir.
mr.
john
lord

your
honor.
mr.
john

no.
mr.
john

no.
that
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference.
they
have

--
mr.
john

no.
that
wouldn't
have
an
effect
--
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
thought
you
meant,
could
they
have
taxed
us.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
as
the
--
mortgagees.
--
could
they
have
taken

could
they
have
taken
the
three
trucks

--
for
the
purposes
--
mr.
john
lord

while
they
were
----
mr.
john
lord

--
in
the
possession
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
of
the
carrier
--
of
the
carrier?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
think
there
the
old
cases
would
apply
that
would
limit
the
right
of
seizure
to
the
value
of
the
property
right
of
the
carrier
in
those
trucks.
it
wasn't
outstanding
interest
there
--
the
--
in
the
chattel
mortgage.
but
that
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
oh,
yes.
and
i'm
not
contesting
that
although
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
i
haven't
given
any
thought
to
tell
the
truth
to
--
the
right
of
anybody
but
of
conditional
vendor
here.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
oh,
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
that
is,
could
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
the
--
of
--
of
public
policy,
restrict
the
right
of
a
chattel
mortgagee
and
make
it
--
a
mortgagor
and
make
it
different
from
this?
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
they
said
(inaudible)
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
by
saying
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
i
think
--
i
think
they
might.
except
that
i
still
insist
that
they
cannot
tax
me.
they
cannot
measure
a
tax
against
me
by
the
amount
of
somebody
else's
property
or
somebody
else's
taxes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
yes.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no
--
no,
your
--
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
no.
they
--
the
tax
--
that's
--
that's
one
of
the
paradoxes
of
this
case.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
from
taxes
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
well,
i
--
that
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
what
--
what
the
motive
is.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
but
the
attorney
general
has
ruled,
your
honor,
that
this
is
--
this
is
the
paradox
that
we
are
not
liable
for
this
tax
because
we
did
not
use,
ourselves,
the
highways.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
the
--
the
trucks
were
used.
but
this
is
not
a
tax,
the
appellee
say
in
their
brief
upon
us
nor
is
it
a
tax
upon
the
vehicles.
it's
a
tax
only
upon
the
carrier.
but
it's
lifted
over
by
this
lien
argument
here
and
impose
on
us
and
we
say
that
cannot
be
done
because
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
property
rights
that
we
cannot
be
taxed.
and
that
this
question
in
another
form
has
been
before
this
court,
i'm
sure
many
times
about
the
measure
of
the
tax.
this
statute,
it
describes
exactly
how
the
tax
have
been
measured,
according
to
the
use
of
each
vehicle.
this
isn't
one
of
those
numerous
cases
where
it's
difficult
to
break
down
taxes.
and
they
--
they
know
what
use
has
been
made
of
this
vehicle
--
of
these
three
vehicles.
they
come
in
then
and
--
and
impose
on
the
theory
that
they
--
that
the
state
has
a
power
to
impose
a
lien
and
do
by
to
a
lien
something
you
could
not
do
in
any
other
way
but
simply
saying
there's
a
lien
on
all
vehicles.
they
say
that's
sufficient
excuse
for
what
the
state
has
done
in
this
case.
we
say
that
cannot
be
done
in
the
--
in
the
light
of
the
fundamental
conception
of
property
rights.
tax
--
the
amount
of
taxes
must
be
measured
by
the
benefit
or
the
opportunities,
or
the
results
to
a
particular
taxpayer
or
group
of
taxpayers.
and
therefore,
i
end
where
i
began.
that
here
we
are
with
our
property
seized
and
admittedly
seized
for
a
tax
to
which
we
never
were
liable
and
--
and
measured
not
by
the
use
of
the
three
vehicles
we
sold
but
measured
by
all
the
vehicles
that
the
this
--
this
carrier
own.
and
going
back
to
a
time
where
as
justice
van
voorhees
said
in
his
opinion
that
some
of
these
taxes
accrued
even
before
the
appellant's
vehicles
were
manufactured.
and
--
and
we
are
called
on
to
pay
them.
the
--
my
time
--
the
--
let
me
--
may
i
read
just
two
or
three
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
sentences
from
the
--
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
--
the
one
--
one
opinion
below
that
took
our
view
of
the
matter.
he
said
that,
it
starts
off,
it's
in
the
transcript
of
record
at
pages
20
and
21.
it's
only
one
page.
he
said,
"appellants
could
not
have
ascertained
the
tax
liabilities
of
the
vendee
prior
to
the
sale."
he
means
because
of
the
secrecy
provision,
even
if
the
books
of
the
tax
commission
have
been
opened
to
them
in
as
much
as
a
vendee
had
filed
incorrect
tax
return.
highway
use
taxes
accruing
with
respect
to
vehicles
sold
can
be
given
priority
over
appellant's
property
interest
in
those
vehicles.
but
it
seems
to
me,
they
constitute
depravation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law
and
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
to
subject
the
recognized
security
interest
of
a
conditional
vendor
to
taxes
which
have
accrued
against
the
conditional
vendee
without
reference
to
these
vehicles
and
in
substantial
part
before
they
were
delivered
to
the
conditional
vendee
or
even
manufactured.
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
if
it
please
the
court.
i
believe,
i
have
four
minutes
and
if
i
may
briefly
make
three
brief
statements,
i
should
be
satisfied.
some
question
--
let
me
--
let
me
restate
the
realities
in
which
we
find
ourselves.
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
arisen
under
this
particular
statute
and
the
first
case
that
we
know
of
for
an
attempt
has
been
made
anywhere
to
enforce
a
lien
of
the
sort
here
described
against
anyone
except
the
carrier.
in
the
second
place,
this
is
also
one
of
the
first
cases
that
has
arisen
in
years.
i
--
i
submit
this
was
a
little
different,
this
view
where
this
court
have
been
confronted
boldly
with
the
naked
assertion
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
the
--
the
property
of
one
man
may
be
taken
to
pay,
not
--
not
liabilities
but
to
pay
a
tax
lien
for
a
use
of
the
highways
for
which
he
is
not
liable
in
law.
that
is
the
situation
we
find
ourselves
in.
nobody
has
said
anything
of
another
point,
i
think,
and
that
is
that
before
the
lien
was
--
this
inchoate
lien
was
asserted
and
so,
as
we
say
liquidated
by
the
state
firmed
up
by
the
assessment
and
notice
to
the
carrier.
before
that
happened,
the
--
these
appellants
had
by
proper
legal
proper
--
process
recovered
their
three
trucks
and
were
now
the
sole
owners
of
those
trucks.
the
legal
effect
of
that
is
that
they
had
extinguished
all
of
their
rights
against
the
carting
company
and
therefore,
if
they
pay
this
tax,
they
have
no
recourse
against
anyone
with
which
to
recover
it.
now,
allusion
was
made
secondly
by
counsel
to
the
fact
that
summary
process
is
--
is
well
recognized
in
the
collection
of
taxes.
but
summary
process
at
which
is
often
brought
into
question
in
connection
with
federal
taxes,
summary
process,
so
this
court
declared
in
phillips
against
the
commissioner
is
justified
in
certain
cases
because
in
those
cases,
adequate
judicial
review
is
provided
for
the
person
who
is
against
to
whom
the
lien
is
asserted.
on
the
question
of
due
process,
the
lower,
in
the
submission
of
--
in
the
submission
of
this
case,
the
stipulated
submission,
the
point
was
expressly
reserved
in
a
separate
paragraph
that
--
that
these
parties
had
had
no
notice
of
the
delinquency
of
the
assessment
or
the
--
or
the
existence
of
liabilities
and
they
were
given
not
--
no
fair,
adequate
and
timely
notice,
thereby,
permitting
their
property
to
be
--
to
be
taken
without
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard
etcetera,
etcetera
in
violation
of
constitutional
right.
and
the
lower
court
commented
on
that
without
really
passing
upon
it,
related
it
to
the
secrecy
provisions.
and
--
and
in
our
briefs,
we
raised
the
same
question
of
--
of
lack
of
due
process.
it
is
true
that
the
record
does
not
show
that
these
parties
ever
asked
a
hearing.
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
we
have
assumed
that
the
record
was
silent
on
that
because
--
because
there
was
no
provision
in
the
statute
under
which
we
could
obtain
a
hearing
and
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
we
ever
made
a
demand
for
information
from
the
tax
commission
as
to
these
trucks.
it
is
silent.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
view
stated
by
my
opponent
that
we
could
have
obtained
if
we
had
sought
a
certified
copy
of
--
of
the
delinquent
records.
that
is
a
right
granted
--
certified
company
be
granted
by
the
tax
commission
to
federal
officials
or
to
officials
of
government
who
have
a
special
interest.
but
there
is
no
provision
for
the
granting
of
any
rights
to
us
that
there
is
an
explanation,
a
possible
explanation
for
that,
based
purely
on
conjecture,
i
admit,
and
that
is
that
when
the
statute,
draftsman
of
the
statute
used
the
word
"owner",
he
may
have
meant
to
include
a
conditional
vendor
and
make
him
jointly
liable
for
the
collection
of
the
tax.
he
may
have
meant
that
and
that
would
have,
of
course,
included
the
right
of
the
conditional
vendor
to
have
all
these
statutory
reservations
of
procedure.
now,
let
me
submit
one
final
statement,
if
the
court
will
permit,
and
go
back
to
the
flat
realities
of
the
situation
that
we
have
and
that
is
this,
we're
perhaps
admittedly
our
property
has
been
ceased
to
pay
taxes
assessed
against
the
cartage
company,
that's
not
in
dispute.
they
were
incurred
by
the
cartage
company
through
the
use
of
a
fleet
of
trucks,
13
other
trucks
in
addition
to
our
12
other
trucks,
in
addition
to
our
three.
and
they
--
these
taxes,
the
bulk
of
them,
at
the
analysis
of
the
submitted
statement
will
show,
accrued
against
the
carrier
before
we
sold
our
three
trucks
to
the
carrier.now,
those
facts
are
submitted
and
that
establishes
the
fact
that
this
tax
sought
to
be
--
i
am
trying
to
get
a
word
--
away
from
the
ambiguity
of
the
word
"liabilities".
these
taxes
now
assessed
against
us
by
this
lien
process
were
taxes
measured
by
the
use
of
other
vehicles
than
ours
on
the
highway.
that's
the
heart
of
this
--
of
this
assertion
and
the
commission
asserts
that
nevertheless,
this
seizure
--
this
seizure
may
be
made
legal
through
their
interpretation
of
the
lien
provision
of
the
statute.
we
have
conceded
that
our
taxes
--
that
out
trucks
may
be
taxed
by
a
tax
measured
by
their
use.
but
by
the
use
of
this
lien
provision,
and
i
don't
intent
to
reiterate
what's
been
said
on
it,
by
the
use
of
this
lien
provision,
by
the
interpretation
of
this
lien
provision
made
by
the
state
tax
commission,
they
have
sought
and
are
seeking
here
to
do
something
that
i
think
has
never
been
approved
by
this
court,
namely,
they
are
seeking
to
impose
by
indirection,
those
taxes
for
which
we
are
not
liable
upon
us.
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case
and
that,
i
think,
violates
as
i
said
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
property
rights
in
relation
to
taxation
as
laid
down
in
knowlton
against
moore
and
many,
many,
many
cases
of
this
court.
and
that
is
the
case
that
we
leave
with
you,
your
honors.
thank
you.
