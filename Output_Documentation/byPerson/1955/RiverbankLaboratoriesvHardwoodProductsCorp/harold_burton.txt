justice

burton
but
the
very
fact
that
it
interpreted
that
law
as
of
today
meant
that
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
that
is
still
the
law
today,
did
it
not?
justice
harold
burton
well,
it
--
justice
harold
burton
mechanically,
it
did
announce
it
from
the
bench.
justice
harold
burton
and
said
there's
some
--
justice

mr.
rosenfield,
you're
familiar
with
our
case
at
perkins
against
18/09
justice
harold
burton
well,
in
that
case,
wasn't
it
the
fact
that
there,
the
ohio
court
--
the
ohio
courts
in
their
old
decisions
had
felt
bound
by
the
old
federal
court
decisions
without
paying
attention
to
the
international
shoe?
and
then,
the
current
supreme
court
of
ohio
felt
still
bound
by
it,
and
we
said
they
were
not
bound
by
those
--
those
old
decisions
but
they
had
a
leeway
to
either
accept
or
not
accept
in
the
light
of
the
international
shoe
case
and
send
it
back
to
them
to
decide.
well
now
--
justice
harold
burton
--
haven't
we
the
same
case
here
except
it's
already
been
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
harold
burton
well,
but
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
what
we
did
in
that
case
was
to
send
it
back
to
them
to
decide
what
they
would
do
in
the
old
cases
in
the
light
of
the
international
shoe
case.
and
here,
that's
already
been
done
hasn't
it
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit?
they've
looked
at
the
old
cases
and
they've
looked
at
the
international
shoe
case.
they
must
be
familiar
with
it
in
the
seventh
circuit
and
they
say,
“that's
still
the
law
of
the
illinois.”
justice
harold
burton
well,
but
they
knew
it.

harold
burton
