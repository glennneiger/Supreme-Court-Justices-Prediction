mr.
rosenfield,
your
time
has
expired,
but
your
entire
time
was
taken
up
answering
questions.
if
you
should
like
five
minutes
more
to
summarize,
you
may
--
you
may
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
literature
of
the
company
shows
that
did
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fox.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
had
he
been
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
that
capacity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
that
--
what
was
that
special
meaning,
“doing
business?”
what
was
that
special
meaning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
--
what
direct
authority
do
you
have
on
that
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
they
have
said
that
in
your
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
--
we'll
recess
now.
that's
half
an
answer
to
my
question
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
had
said
that
through
a
reason
was
the
answer
and
that's
all
--
all
that
you
had,
but
then
i
ask
you,
well
if
--
if
congress
do
it
and
you
said
congress
could
very
easily
have
said
that
it
wanted
that
way.
how
would
you
set
it
if
--
if
you
are
going
to
say
it
other
than
congress
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
found
that
they
were
doing
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
they
didn't
want
to
do
that,
maybe
they
want
to
do
exactly
what
they
said
and
--
and
confine
it
to
those
who
were
authorized
the
registry
to
do
business
for
those
who
were
actually
doing
business
in
the
state.
maybe
they
didn't
want
to
go
as
far
as
to
say
for
who
was
found
in
that
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
thing
that
i
can't
quite
understand
is
--
is
what
leads
you
to
say
that
congress
must
have
meant
doing
business
according
to
the
understanding
of
state
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
its
venue
a
question
of
a
substantive
law
or
a
question
of
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it's
procedural
which
procedure
should
apply
in
the
federal
case,
federal
or
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
rule
in
--
in
illinois
concerning
the
maintenance
of
an
action
by
an
illinois
resident
for
an
injury
caused
in
illinois
by
nonresident?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
i
was
talking
about
was
not
the
federal
rule
but
the
illinois
rule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
yes
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
this
question
on
bearing
on
--
on
the
facts
in
this
case.
suppose
this
resident
agent
or
whatever
--
whatever
you
designate
him
as,
in
the
state
of
illinois
went
out
to
service,
one
of
this
acoustical
machines
and
blew
up
the
building
and
destroyed
property
and
injured
citizens
of
illinois.
could
they
maintain
in
the
illinois
courts
an
action
against
this
company
that
he
is
working
for
assuming
negligence
was
established?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
took
--
took
a
mechanic
with
him
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
prohibited
from
doing
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
was
he
prohibited
by
his
duties
from
doing
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
he
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
just
advised
them
what
to
do
and
he
advised
them
negligibly
and
they'd
followed
his
advice
and
blew
up
the
building.
would
you
sue
the
--
would
you
sue
the
company
then
in
--
in
illinois
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
as
to
whether
he
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
i
thought
he
advised
architects,
i
thought
he
advised
city
officials
as
to
what
they
should
put
in
to
their
building
codes
from
the
standpoint
to
safety
factors
and
acoustical
factors
and
so
forth.
if
he
could
advise
the
whole
city
as
to
what
they
should
do
with
such
instruments,
why
couldn't
they
advise
a
single
client
of
this
--
of
this
firm
what
to
do
with
their
particular
instruments?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
did
go
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
understood
it,
you
--
you
stated
that
he
knew
more
about
the
acoustical
business
of
the
company
and
about
these
instruments
than
anyone
else
in
the
--
in
the
company
and
he
was
authorized
to
go
out
and
--
and
answer
complaints
about
the
--
about
these
instruments
if
anything
went
wrong.
now,
was
he
just
to
go
there
to
those
places
and
record
what
people
told
him
and
remained
silent
and
do
nothing
and
send
it
back
to
wisconsin
and
--
and
let
them
do
whatever
is
necessary
or
--
or
did
he
in
the
ordinary
course
of
his
business,
would
he
in
the
ordinary
course
of
his
business
advising
what
--
what
ought
to
be
done
for
as
to
make
this
operable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
is
it
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page
is
it
in
the
record
that
shows
you
it's
a
mere
messenger?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
did
it
show
in
the
record
here
that
on
these
occasions
when
he
went
out
responding
to
complaints
by
the
--
these
people
that
all
he
did
was
act
as
a
messenger
boy
as
you're
stating?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
that's
for
a
new
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
new
parts
of
the
equipment
and
for
replacing
the
equipment,
but
what
is
there
to
show
that
when
he
went
out
and
responded
to
these
complaints,
if
--
if
there's
anything
wrong
with
that
that
he
couldn't
give
them
the
advise
necessary
to
--
to
adjust
it
so
that
it
would
be
useable.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
added
complaint
either
in
illinois
or
in
any
--
any
part
of
the
country,
where
would
--
where
would
people
send
their
complaint
into
if
it
was
in
the
acoustical
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
your
own
--
as
i
understand
it
from
exhibit
b
on
page
149,
your
own
literature
says
riverbank
sound
insulating
doors
manufactured
under
patent
license
by
hardwood
products
corporation,
neenah
wisconsin,
acoustical
department,
75
east
wacker
chicago,
illinois.
now,
isn't
that
an
invitation
to
--
to
the
people
you
deal
--
deal
with
to
communicate
with
them
in
the
acoustical
department?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fox
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
a
moment.
your
time
has
expired
and
we've
taken
most
of
your
time
for
--
to
ask
you
questions.
you
may
have
five
minutes
to
summarize
if
you
wish
to
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
