justice
felix
frankfurter
could
this
case
have
been
brought
in
--
in
an
illinois
state
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
i
don't
understand.
if
there
was
--
if
it
was
not
waived
into
this,
according
to
illinois
law,
as
expounded
by
the
court
of
appeals
by
your
(inaudible),
your
court
of
appeals,
how
would
it
be
doing
business?
how
would
it
be
--
how
can
it
be
the
basis
of
the
--
well,
i
understood
the
proceeding
of
illinois
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
latest?
we've
just
heard
this
morning
for
the
case
of
1910
is
controlling
so
far
as
the
federal
courts
are
concerned
you're
going
to
find
out
what
state
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
elicit
from
you
what
i
do
not
know
at
all.
i
know
no
knowledge
of
it,
except
what
i
read
in
this
opinion
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
reading
as
to
what
my
understand
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
why,
not
as
a
forecast
of
what
you
would
think
the
illinois
supreme
court
will
do
by
--
by
reason
of
the
international
shoe
case,
but
what
the
court
of
appeals,
your
court
of
appeals
has
acquaint
authority
to
pronounce
that
illinois
law
said
in
the
illinois
law
when
they
wrote
this
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
my
question
to
you
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
basis
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
concedes
to
be
the
law
of
illinois,
could
this
sue
just
prevail,
assuming
you
could
prevail
on
the
merits?
could
this
--
could
the
illinois
court
have
jurisdiction
according
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
concede
to
be
illinois
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
something
of
that
was,
the
view
of
the
illinois
for
the
court
of
appeals
regarding
what
the
illinois
law
is,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
by
meaning
there
is
no
illinois
law,
meaning,
you
couldn't
go
to
a
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
as
finding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is,
if
i
follow
you,
that
there
is
illinois
law
which
--
which
said
in
the
past
by
the
decision
of
the
court
that
a
defendant
in
the
position
of
this
defendant
and
the
circumstances
like
under
these
circumstances
would
bar
suit
in
the
illinois
state
court
because
of
the
overriding
authority
of
the
--
of
this
court
regarding
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
is
that
that
ground
of
non-jurisdiction
has
been
cut
from
under,
has
been
removed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
have
to
find
out
what
illinois
law
is
within
the
control
of
illinois.
illionius
on
the
subject
as
we
all
know
that
decisions
are
mountainous
of
multitudeness
and
there
--
every
which
way,
and
there
is
a
local
law
as
well
as
the
federal
law,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
illinois.
i'm
talking
my
general
knowledge
of
law
tells
me.
take
new
york
about
which
i
know.
take
new
york.
new
york,
apart
from
any
question
of
what
the
--
the
due
process
was
required
had
its
own
law
of
what
doing
businesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we're
not
concerned
whether
it
did
or
it
didn't.
we're
not
concerned
with
it
because
this
is
illinois
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
the
supreme
court
of
--
then
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
in
saying
this
is
illinois
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
take
on
the
bigger
burden
that
you've
got?
if
you
are
right,
if
you
are
right
--
i
know
lawyers
like
to
do
it
and
judges
sometimes.
if
you
are
right
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
is
illinois
law,
and
illinois
law
was
based
on
a
decision
and
decision
of
this
court,
and
this
court
has
eaten
its
past
decisions
then
this
isn't
illinois
law
and
that's
predicated.
you
don't
have
to
go
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
problem
of
whether
it's
erie-tompkins
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
isn't
that
your
first
argument
not
your
last
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
we
have
to
take
on
this
not
easy
question
for
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
take
on
if
what
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
illinois
isn't
illinois
law?
it
was
an
end
of
the
matter,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
between
a
state
court,
may
on
a
problem
of
this
--
or
to
say,
“we
haven't
got
a
voice
of
our
own.
we
just
have
to
echo
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
tells
us,”
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
lead
to
it
juristically
speaking
or
a
state
court
may
say,
“whether
we
are
or
aren't
heard
by
the
due
process
clause
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court,
this
is
our
state
law.”
now,
you
can
deny
to
that,
do
you?
you
say
that
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
deposition
in
filing
your
deposition,
you
were
acting
on
the
assumption
that
if
you
could
bring
yourself
on
an
--
on
allegations
of
facts,
on
allegations
of
facts,
to
your
legal
argument,
on
allegation
of
the
fact
that
international
shoe,
that
international
shoe
took
care
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
said
in
effect,
“as
we
have
interpreted
the
illinois
cases,
under
illinois
cases,
you
were
not
doing
business
and
paid
no
attention.”
this
is
your
argument
that
illinois
cases
rested
on
the
construction
of
the
due
process
clause
of
this
court
and
they
paid
no
attention
to
the
latest
in
answer
to
this
court
as
to
what
is
doing
business
within
the
due
process
clause
in
the
international
shoe,
that's
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rosenfield,
i
--
i
sent
for
bull
against
boston
&
maine
but
until
i
get
a
chance
to
read
it
myself.
would
you
tell
me
the
part
where
that
case
play
in
your
argument
because
in
canvas
fabricators
case
to
which
the
court
of
appeals
merely
affirmed
has
having
disposed
of
these
questions.
they
rely
mainly
on
bull
against
boston
&
maine.
now,
the
bull
against
boston
&
maine
do
what
mr.
justice
burton
has
suggested,
namely,
although
it
didn't
have
to,
a
state
is
limited
by
the
due
process
clause
but
it
may
have
a
narrower
line
towards
them,
then
the
due
process
draw
the
line
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
it
can't
–
a
state
can't
allow
the
suit
where
a
person
isn't
amenable
to
judicial
process
according
to
due
process
law.
but
a
state
may
go
on
a
narrower
line
and
due
process
clause
is
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
happily
--
if
--
if
you
happily
not
draw
the
line,
and
therefore,
hasn't
been
with
many
cases
which
i
have,
you
wouldn't
put
any
limits
to
the
diversity
of
view
the
courts
might
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
trying
to
go
(inaudible)
what
i
want
to
know
is
i
think
it's
susceptible
of
objective
proof,
namely,
has
illinois
given
any
evidence
that
it
determined
what
is
doing
business,
otherwise
then,
by
what
is
--
by
what
itself
it
is
compelled
to
decide
in
view
of
this
court's
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
requires
a
critical
review
of
illinois
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
citation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
looking
at
the
–
an
older
case.
they
all
go
back
--
a
good
many
of
them
go
back
which
follows
(inaudible),
does
it,
37
u.s.
and
that's
what
this
case
is,
booz
against
texas
&
pacific
railway
company,
is
that
right?
do
you
remember?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
one
of
the
old
ones
throughout.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
only
two
minutes
left
and
you
haven't
merely
reached
the
--
the
sensitive
question
on
which
you'd
like
this
court
to
pronounce.
so,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
assume
that
illinois
says,
“we
follow
the
--
we
have
to
follow
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
for
all
this
time
(inaudible)
the
united
states
now
becomes
more
liberal
as
we
phrased
then.
it
allows
a
suit
even
where
--
on
a
subtle
merely
solicit
business
but
we
think
that
is
menarche
as
the
basis
of
opening
our
court.
suppose
that's
illinois
law.
suppose
they
say,
“we
don't
have
to
be
as
restrictive
as
prior
decisions
report
the
basis
but
we
think
it's
pretty
good.”
anyhow,
we
shall
follow
that
as
a
local
law.
can
you
entertain
that
hypothesis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
entertain
it.
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
any
state
would
deny
its
own
citizens'
access
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
think
of
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say
--
what
would
you
say
to
what
this
court
has
said
to
become
pretty
debarred
of
what
erie-tompkins
mean
if
you
--
to
be
drawn
out
of
the
state
court.
you
can't
stay
in
the
federal
court
or
the
state
out
of
which
you
would
be
going
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
except
–
except
of
illinois
plaintiffs
suing
this
alleged
in
of
what
they
infringed
as
unfair
competition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
an
illinois
person
doing
an
illinois
corporation
couldn't
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
what
the
out-of-state,
the
out-of-state
plaintiff
having
advantage
of
the
in-state
plaintiff,
would
be
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
new
york
doesn't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rosenfield,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
be
pressing
you
but
i
must
act
before
this
hypothesis
that
you're
wiling
intellectually
to
entertain
but
might
be
difficult,
in
fact,
to
agree.
now,
if
illinois,
if
illinois
make
the
rule
which
was
generated
by
the
constitutional
decisions
of
this
court,
the
local
law,
assume
that
was
a
local
law,
then
we
reach
now
to
the
question
of
whether
that's
erie-tompkins
or
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
do
you
remember
the
case
--
do
you
recall
a
case
of
this
court,
people
against
commissioner
or
the
other
way
around
in
which
this
court
said
that
--
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
is
illinois
law,
is
illinois
law
as
far
as
making
decisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
you
say
if
–
if
i
obedient
to
decision
of
this
court
says,
“well,
that
is
(inaudible)
to
know
more
about
their
divorce
of
illinois
law.
and
therefore,
i
must
be
obedient
to
what
they
tell
me
is
illinois
law.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
get
me
out
of
that
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
forgive
me
for
saying
i
think
i
understand
your
argument
but
how
did
it
help
to
get
me
out
of
the
box?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
said
--
but
it
said
that
the
latest
in
all
those
pleadings
to
this
case
is
bull
&
company
and
boston
&
maine.
so,
does
that
mean
you
suggest
you
thought
of
bull
&
company
and
see
whether
i
can,
in
good
conscience,
interpret
that
decision
to
be
an
expression
of
illinois
law
under
influence
and
uncontrolled
by
a
federal
law?
and
if
it
is
and
it
is
a
federal
law,
and
if
it
isn't
then
you
suggest
for
some
reason
or
rather
in
connection
to
both
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
pay
no
attention
to
international
shoe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
--
do
i
infer
that
if
the
international
shoe
case
governed
and
there
was
doing
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
your
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
maybe
your
is
that
illinois
has
a
local
rule
narrowly
than
international
shoe
will
permit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
your
--
what
is
--
how
would
you
document
that?
how
would
you
–
what
are
the
cases
that
you
involve
for
that
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
--
including
international
shoe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
your
position
implies
as
it
is
or
carries
with
it
your
test
for
the
establishment
that
those
illinois
cases
did
not
depend
on
what
they
call
was
the
requirement
of
due
process
and
expounded
by
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
if
a
state
goes
beyond
what
you
have
to
call
the
floor,
why
would
it
be
bothering
to
say
that
it
must
give
heat
to
the
floor
when
it
goes
deep,
can
go
beyond
it
and
does
go
beyond
it?
what's
the
relevance
in
these
illinois
cases?
are
there
reference
to
the
compulsive
duty
to
follow
this
court
if
they
don't
have
to
follow
defies
having
a
ceiling
above
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
doubt
it
would,
myself,
speaking
for
myself.
i
have
no
doubt
it
could.
i
have
difficulty,
however,
in
trying
to
explain
state
cases
which
could
go
beyond
riding
in
an
atmosphere
which
indicates
that
they
must
be
awfully
observant
not
to
go
beyond.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
international
shoe
is
very
–
merely
10
years
old.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
extent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
in
--
(inaudible)
if
this
case
is
precisely
this
case
have
been
brought
exactly
that
the
record
as
it
is
had
been
brought
today
for
section
17
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.(voice

--
justice
felix

would
--
would
--
justice

if
this
were
brought
--
if
it's
brought
in
the

if
it
was
broadened
a
bit,
it
could
be
brought
in
the
state
courts.
offhand,
i
don't
see
any
difficulty
in
bringing
it
to
the
federal
court.
that's
why
i
asked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
precise
litigation,
the
record
as
it
is,
that
it
applies
today
when
it
was
applied.
would
the
illinois,
the
new
--
the
amendment,
the
old
civil
practice
act,
take
care
of
it
and
therefore,
would
the
district
court
properly
retain
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
--
you
would
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
you
would
go
to
the
fact
to
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
not
because
that
the
--
the
--
illinois
has
a
feeling
instead
of
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
transaction
of
any
business
within
this
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
be
within

there's
no
transactions
of
any
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
doesn't
state
here
arising
from
the
doing
of
any
of
the
said
act,
the
transaction
of
any
business.
it
wasn't
the
transaction
here
in
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
was
no
transaction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
illinois
here?
justice

and
