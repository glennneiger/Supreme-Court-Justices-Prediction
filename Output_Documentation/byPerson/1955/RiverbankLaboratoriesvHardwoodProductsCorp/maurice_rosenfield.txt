mr.
maurice
rosenfield
this
case,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
seventh
circuit,
involves
a
wisconsin
corporation's
defense
to
a
diversity
suit
of
chicago
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
doing
business
there.
the
exact
issue,
which
this
creates
on
this
court,
is
whether
this
defense
is
to
be
tested
on
the
merits
by
state
law
under
the
erie
rule
or
whether
it
is
governed
by
the
principles
announced
by
this
court
in
the
international
shoe
case,
or
whether
it's
is
governed
by
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code
enacted
in
1948.
the
action
wanted
to
enjoin
a
common
law
tort.
the
infringement
of
the
name
riverbank
is
applied
to
acoustical
doors.
the
key
facts
bearing
on
the
question
of
doing
business
are
these.
the
defendant
is
a
wisconsin
corporation
with
its
home
office
at
neenah,
wisconsin.
it
has
maintained
a
chicago
office
for
30
years.
its
acoustical
division,
which
is
called
as
acoustical
department,
is
headquartered
at
chicago.
the
acoustical
--
the
acoustical
department
of
chicago
solicited
business
in
illinois
and
throughout
the
country,
and
supervised
other
agents
located
elsewhere.
sales
manuals
and
literature
went
from
the
department
headquarters
of
chicago
all
over
the
country.
the
chicago
headquarters
of
the
acoustical
department
was
responsible
for
sales
everywhere.
the
agent
in
charge
of
the
chicago
office
knew
more
about
acoustics
than
the
chief
executives
of
the
company.
his
compensation
reflected
his
special
contributions
to
the
development
of
the
company's
product.
shipments
by
the
defendant
into
illinois
amounted
to
over
$500,000
a
year
and
into
the
chicago
area
about
$100,000,
but
it
is
true
that
the
sales
blanks
here
are
used
by
the
defendant,
had
a
clause
printed
on
the
back
requiring
all
orders
to
be
accepted
at
the
home
office.
on
consideration
of
these
facts,
the
district
court
overruled
the
motion
to
dismiss,
proceeded
to
the
merits
and
granted
an
injunction.
it
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
case
was
brief
and
argued
on
the
merits.
the
defendant,
however,
preserved
this
jurisdictional
point
and
persuaded
the
court
to
that
effect,
holding
the
lower
court
lack
jurisdiction
it
reversed
for
dismissal.
its
decision
was
based
entirely
on
an
illinois
rule
that
when
orders
are
solicited
subject
to
acceptance
at
a
home
office,
the
corporation
is
not
doing
business
and
is
not
suable.
a
couple
of
preliminary
points
to
put
this
issue
in
contest,
first,
this
case,
raises
no
question
of
venue
under
the
federal
venue
statute.
our
opponents
characterized
the
case
as
raising
a
question
of
venue
under
section
1391
(c)
of
the
judicial
code.
if
the
court
accepts
that
characterization
of
the
case,
it
must
reverse
it
because
venue
may
be
satisfied
in
one
of
two
ways,
then
you
can
be
laid,
either
where
all
the
plaintiffs
reside
or
where
the
defendant
resides.
there
is
one
plaintiff
here
and
that
plaintiff
resided
in
the
district
--
in
the
division
where
the
case
was
brought.
since,
therefore,
a
venue
was
satisfied
under
1391
(a).
there
is
no
occasion
at
all
to
look
to
1391
(c).
the
second
preliminary
issue
is
this,
the
defendant
pleads
for
trial
at
neenah,
wisconsin
under
the
laws
of
wisconsin.
this
is
a
misleading
statement
of
the
alternative.
the
alternative
was
not
and
never
was
trialed
in
the
state
court
of
wisconsin.
the
alternative
to
trial
in
the
district
court
of
chicago
was
trialed
in
the
federal
court
at
milwaukee.
neenah
happens
to
be
in
the
milwaukee
federal
district,
the
southern
district
of
wisconsin,
90
miles
from
chicago,
and
it
would
have
been
one
of
these
two
federal
courts.
more
than
that,
both
of
them
obviously
are
within
the
seventh
circuit,
so
that
this
case,
if
the
decision
holds,
must
go
back
to
another
federal
court
within
the
same
circuit
only
to
--
only
to
return
to
that
circuit
for
decision
on
the
merits,
and
it
must
go
to
that
court
on
the
merits
since
it's
important
enough
to
be
here.
it
will
be
important
enough
to
either
side
to
take
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
decision
on
the
merits.
this
has
deeper
implications
though,
just
then
that
the
parties
have
been
subjected
to
expense
in
delay
in
the
federal
judicial
system
to
inconvenience
and
burdens.
a
deeper
significance
is
that
it
points
out
exactly
what
the
issue
is
on
the
business.
not
doing
business
defense
is
raised
in
diversity
cases.
the
issue
is
in
what
the
federal
district
does
at
fair
administration
of
justice
permit
this
case
to
be
tried.
that's
all
that's
involved
when
it
is
in
--
when
the
issue
was
raised
in
a
--
in
a
diversity
case.
now,
when
the
issue
arises
in
the
state
court,
it's
really
a
bad
issue
too,
no
matter
how
perverse
a
plaintiff's
judgment
may
have
been
in
selecting
his
forum.
no
court
has
ever
been
known
to
dismiss
him
on
the
merits.
the
object
of
the
decision
obviously
is
to
get
the
case
tried
on
the
merits
in
some
other
place,
a
more
preferred
forum.
now,
this
court
has
exercised
control
over
state
excess
in
this
field.
that
is
when
the
states
go
too
far
in
taking
these
cases
against
corporations.
it
has
always
exercised
control
over
the
states
under
the
due
process
clause
for
63
years
from
st.
clair
against
cox
in
1882,
160
u.s.
to
the
international
shoe
case
in
1945.
this
control
was
in
jurisprudential
terms
involving
the
nature
of
corporate
personality
presence,
whether
a
corporation
was
present
or
could
be
present
outside
of
the
state
which
created
it.
in
1945,
this
court
reconsidered
the
entire
matter,
reevaluated
the
principles
and
changed
the
due
process
test
to
one
of
fairness,
decency,
substantial
justice,
stating
that
what
is
required
is
a
balancing
of
convenience,
an
estimate
of
inconvenience
and
this
meant
an
evaluation
to
both
sides,
not
just
the
corporate
defendant,
but
in
the
evaluation
of
the
plaintiff's
position
as
well
as
the
defendant's
position.
in
the
new
terms
of
the
international
shoe
case,
the
control
device
was
indistinguishable
from
a
doctrine
of
forum
non-convenience.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
could
this
case
have
been
brought
in
an
illinois
state
court?
yes,
sir,
it
could.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
hasn't
been
a
decision
in
the
state
court
of
illinois
on
this
question
since
the
international
shoe
case
in
1945,
all
of
the
decisions.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
but
this
is
a
question
of
due
process
of
law.
the
state
--
all
of
the
state
court
of
illinois,
all
of
the
decisions
of
the
state
court
of
illinois
are
in
federal
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
said
that
illinois
law
is
that
a
corporation
which
solicits
orders
subject
to
the
acceptance
of
its
home
office
is
not
doing
business
in
illinois
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
basing
it
on
illinois
decisions
which
preceded
international
shoe.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
according
to
what
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
whether
there's
any
law
--
whether
there's
any
illinois
law
at
all
on
doing
business.
there
is
no
illinois
law
on
doing
business.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no,
i
mean,
if
there
was
--
that
the
illinois
decisions
are
federal
–
are
decisions
on
federal
constitutional
law.
they
are
decisions
on
due
process
of
law
since
this
court
exercised
for
63
years,
control
over
the
--
over
illinois
as
well
as
the
other
states.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
cut
from
under
them
totally
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
by
decision
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no,
sir.
there
is
no
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
would
suggest,
sir,
that
new
york
never
had
its
own
law
of
doing
business.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
well,
i
would
suggest
that
illinois
had
--
never
had
any
law
of
doing
business.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
is
not
only
wrong
in
saying
this
is
illinois
law.
it's
wrong
in
saying
that
there's
any
such
thing
the
state
law
of
doing
business.
all
there
has
ever
been
is
federal
constitutional
law.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
by
the
referring
--
by
referring
to
illinois
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
argument
is
made
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
argument
is
made
in
the
brief.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
the
court
misapplied
illinois
law?
that
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
it
--
it
referred
to
--
it
referred
to
a
dead
law.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
is
possible.
it
is
--
it
is
possible,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
it
is
possible,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
that
ground.
if
this
court
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
view
of
illinois
law
and
dead
law.
dead
law
made
dead
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
international
shoe
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
mechanically
applied.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
mechanically
applied
decisions
of
the
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
but
it
just
looked
to
decisions
preceding
the
international
shoe
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
mechanically
applied
them
without
looking
--
without
reevaluating,
without
noticing
that
the
underlying
policy
considerations
had
been
fully
reevaluated
by
this
court,
without
noticing
furthermore
that
--
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
several
times
announced
that
it
is
following
the
supreme
court
decisions,
that
it's
its
duty
to
change
the
--
its
own
decisions
to
fit,
to
follow
the
decisions
of
the
united
states
supreme
court.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
illinois
has
done
the
former.
it
has
not
--
it
is
said
that
we
follow
the
supreme
court
decisions
in
this
field
and
he
quote,
“the
decisions
in
this
state
as
the
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i'm
reading
from
page
14
and
15
of
my
brief,
sir,
“the
decisions
of
this
state
as
to
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
federal
amendment
must
be
controlled
by
the
decisions
of
the
federal
courts,
rather
than
by
the
decisions
of
our
own
or
other
state
courts.”
it
is
our
duty
under
the
law
to
overrule
if
necessary
even
our
own
decisions,
and
follow
the
rule
laid
down
by
the
federal
supreme
court
in
matters
of
this
kind.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
question
arose
through
a
motion
of
the
defendant
corporation
to
dismiss
the
--
the
suit.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
there
was
a
written
reply
in
their
affidavits.
there
were
depositions,
testimony.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
there
are
--
there
are
depositions.
the
depositions
of
their
--
their
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
were
not
doing
business.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
were
not
doing
business.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
doing
business.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
we
took
the
depositions
of
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
we
filed
these
depositions
in
the
court.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
just
the
depositions
of
their
officers
and
employees.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
showing
all
the
facts
on
the
nature
of
their
activities
in
the
state
of
illinois.
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
a
brief
was
filed
and
the
--
the
matter
was
argued
before
the
district
judge.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
by
arguing
that
the
defendant
was
doing
business
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
and
that
it
was
controlled
by
international
shoe
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
court
agreed
with
us.
the
district
judge
agreed
with
us,
sir,
that
the
defendant
was
doing
business
under
the
international
shoe
test
and
dismissed
--
and
denied
the
motion,
preceded
to
the
merits.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
precisely,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
is,
sir.
the
district
judge
--
you
were
speaking
of
them,
the
district
judge
who
overruled
the
defense?
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
i
am,
mr.
justice
burton.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
decided.
that
case
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
decided
to
take
the
case.
that
case
did
not
involve
an
ohio
plaintiff,
an
ohio
citizen,
in
order
that
it
involved
a
cause
of
action
arising
out
of
ohio.
nevertheless,
that
court
on
remand
to
it
took
the
case,
decided
to
take
the
case.
it
recognized
that
this
defendant
was
doing
business
within
your
test
of
the
international
shoe
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
but
they
didn't
even
consider
the
international
shoe
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
didn't
–
they
didn't
even
look
at
the
international
shoe
case,
refused
to
hear
argument
on
the
international
shoe
case,
simply
referred
to
the
illinois
decisions
preceding
the
international
shoe
case,
thus,
bringing
the
bare
all
the
dead
law,
all
the
law
that
you
dented
in
the
international
shoe
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
question
is
always
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
question
is
always
one
of
federal
constitutional
law.
that's
the
only
--
that's
the
question
that
has
ever
been
in
this
--
in
these
cases.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
raises
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
exactly.
there
is
no
state
policy
to
deny
its
own
citizens'
access
to
its
own
courts.
not
only
has
no
state
ever
done
this
on
grounds
of
state
policy,
but
it's
unthinkable
that
any
state
would
deny
its
own
citizens'
access
to
its
own
courts.
all
that
has
happened
here
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
been
controlling
state
action
on
this
field
under
the
due
process
clause,
and
it
has
done
so
since
1882,
first,
in
jurisprudential
terms,
later
in
terms
of
fairness,
and
in
--
a
forum
non-convenience
approach.
the
forum
non-convenience,
the
definition,
the
test
established
in
the
international
shoe
case
is
identical
to
a
background
of
forum
non-convenience.
and
now,
and
simultaneously
with
this
court's
change
of
the
test,
congress
codified
forum
non-convenience
under
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code.
and
the
question
arises
as
to
why
this
question
is
not
covered
in
it's
entirety
in
the
federal
court
system
by
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
do
you
mean
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
do
you
think,
sir,
that
any
state
would,
as
a
matter
of
its
own
policy,
deny
its
own
citizens'
access
to
its
courts?
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
sir,
we
have
read
every
case
since
--
every
state
case
since
international
shoe.
and
not
one
case
--
not
one
state
case
since
international
shoe
has
any
state
court
deliberately
chosen
a
narrower
rule
than
it
may
take
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
illinois
is
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
was
a
critical
reading,
a
very
simple
reading
and
a
very
easy
answer
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
do,
and
the
illinois
decisions
make
it
very
clear
that
this
is
only
a
question
of
federal
due
process
of
law.
may
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
in
addition
to
the
case
you
--
the
bull
case,
that
you
also
look
at
pembleton
against
illinois
commercial
men's
association
relied
on
the
bull
case.

107
to
108
or
124
north
eastern
355
--
359.
now,
there's
a
quote
form
that
case
on
page
14
and
--
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief,
“whether
the
illinois
supreme
court
makes
it
perfectly
obvious
that
its
decision
rest
on
federal
due
process
of
law.”
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
don't
remember
the
burroughs
case.
there
are
so
many
due
process
cases.
the
leading
one,
the
one
that
started
the
chain
in
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
stated
is
st.
clair
against
cox.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
now,
there
is
also
a
new
illinois
statute,
mr.
justice,
that
we
have
brought
to
your
attention
past
since
this
case
in
which
the
illinois
courts
--
the
illinois
statute
is
designed
to
go
as
far
as
the
--
your
decision
in
international
shoe
case
were
permitted
to
go.
that
analysis
is
on
page
22
of
the
record.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
but
i
will
entertain
that
hypothesis.
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
all
right.
my
question
then
is
a
--
a
diversity
case
hearing
in
(inaudible)
this
is
illinois.
does
that
illinois
rule
control
that
diversity
litigation
or
is
a
plaintiff
like
you
in
a
position
to
say,
“no,
we're
in
the
federal
court.”
according
to
the
supreme
court's
decision
it
is
enough
that
we've
got
the
exact
circumstances
in
the
international
shoe,
and
therefore,
it's
going
to
debar.
that's
the
real
question
you
want
to
raise
it.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
point
i
would
say
that
what
illinois
has
done
is
announce
a
rule
of
forum
non-convenience,
announce
its
version
of
a
rule
of
forum
non-convenience.
since
under
the
rule
you
mentioned,
mr.
justice,
it
is
not
dismissing
on
the
merits,
but
deciding
where
this
case
ought
to
be
tried
within
--
within
the
judicial
system.
that
is
the
idea
of
forum
non-convenience.
the
federal
courts
have
their
own
view
of
forum
non-convenience
as
codified
in
1404
(a),
regulating
the
same
question.
there
is
no
difference
in
test.
the
test
is
one
of
fairness,
decency,
justice.
i
assume
illinois'
rule
of
forum
non-convenience
would
be
in
those
terms,
convenient
to
the
parties
and
witness
--
witnesses.
that
is
the
rule.
that
is
the
--
that
is
exactly
what
is
served
by
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
but
when
you
have
said
that
you've
--
you've
done
it
in
cases
dealing
with
discrimination
between
a
residence
and
non-residence,
accidental
results
depending
upon
diversity.
these
cases
always
involve
diversity
conditions.
there
is
no
element
of
discrimination,
whatever,
and
there
is
no
--
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
not
because
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
this
always
involved
diversity
conditions
between
a
local
citizen
and
a
foreign
corporation.
now,
when
you
have
both
elements
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
well,
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
a
--
a
non-resident
plaintiff
and
a
non-resident
corporation,
you
have
an
order
to
give
a
different
question.
you
have
there
a
question,
a
real
question
of
forum
non-convenience.
is
illinois
the
proper
forum
here?
did
the
cause
of
action
arise
here?
neither
the
parties
are
illinois
citizens.
that
is
a
pure
question
of
forum
non-convenience.
that's
not
what
we
have
here
at
all.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
we
have
a
contest
here.
we
have
a
contest
here
of
an
illinois
citizen
against
the
foreign
corporation,
and
i
am
suggesting
that
the
case
of
an
--
of
a
state
citizen
against
the
foreign
corporation
is
an
easy
one
for
state
policy,
that
no
state
would
ever
deny
its
own
citizens
access
to
its
courts.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
could.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
could,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
because
when
a
foreign
--
you
mean
you're
raising
the
question
of
a
distinction
with
--
to
the
woods
case?
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
in
the
woods
case,
at
least
there
was
a
high
probability
that
the
local
citizen
as
a
defendant
was
not
suable
anywhere
else.
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
we
know
if
a
foreign
corporation
is
suable
at
least
that
it's
domicile
and
perhaps
other
places
as
well.
furthermore,
there
was
a
strong
policy
involved.
in
the
–
in
the
woods
case,
the
strong
policy
was
the
policing
of
the
state
qualification
laws.
there
was
no
strong
policy
here.
there
is
no
state
policy
at
all
to
leading,
to
throwing
out
an
–
a
local
citizens
in
the
state's
own
courts.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
ragan
case
related
to
the
cause
of
action.
the
ragan
case
was
tied
in
substantively
to
the
length
of
the
cause
of
action.
there's
nothing
substantive
here.
no
state
has
ever
been
known
to
dismiss
one
of
these
cases
with
--
with
prejudice
around
the
merits.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
mr.
justice,
this
case
involved
a
trade
name,
which
was
used
and
created
in
the
state
of
illinois,
that's
the
plaintiff
side
of
it.
the
defendant
used
this
trade
name
in
an
--
in
an
acoustical
department.
these
were
--
the
trade
names
were
used
as
related
to
acoustical
doors.
the
acoustical
department,
the
defendant's
business
was
headquartered
in
illinois.
that
was
its
main
headquarters.
it
solicited
business
from
those
headquarters
throughout
the
country,
not
only
in
illinois,
but
everywhere.
sales
manuals
and
literature
went
from
this
office
all
over
the
country.
the
representative
of
the
company
in
charge
of
that
office
knew
more
about
acoustics.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
in
illinois,
yes,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
argument
is
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
argument
is
based
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
argument,
sir,
is
based
entirely
on
the
point
that
the
sales
blanks,
the
sales
orders
had
a
provision
on
the
reverse
side
requiring
acceptance
at
the
home
office.
this
is
a
trivial
thing.
it's
--
it's
a
routine
clause
found
in
stationary
--
found
in
blanks
that
are
purchasable
in
stationary
stores
any
place
which
illustrates
the
manipulability
of
this
kind
of
a
defense
that
is
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
had
an
office
with
--
as
i
remember
it,
one
agent
in
charge,
perhaps
several
other
employees.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
lived
in
illinois.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
they
worked
from
that
office.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
out
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
everywhere,
not
just
soliciting
orders
in
illinois
but
everywhere.
they
were
the
acoustical
department
of
this
business.
and
where
so
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
headquarters
of
the
acoustical
department
and
this
whole
problem
involved
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
i
beg
your
pardon?
nationally
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
the
headquarters.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
evidence
shows
that.
may
i
point
to
page
149
of
the
record?
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
literature
of
the
company
itself.
if
you
will
look
at
the
bottom
of
page
149,
sir,
you'll
observe
from
the
bottom
of
page
149,
the
acoustical
department
is
noted,
is
located
at
75
east
wacker,
chicago,
illinois.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
there
has
been
no
denial
that's
the
truth.
it's
brought
out
in
the
depositions.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
--
the
headquarters
of
its
acoustical
department
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
--
its
acoustical
division.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
now,
the
acoustical
division
is
not
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it's
--
that's
exactly
what
the
lawsuit
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
at
neenah,
wisconsin,
its
home
office.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
district
court
overruled
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
the
district
court
overruled
the
motion
in
its
entirety.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
illinois
grounds.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
we
raised
it.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes,
sir.
and
the
illinois
court
--
the
illinois
court
of
appeals
is
on
record
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
was
--
the
whole
point,
the
whole
issue
of
doing
business
was
a
minor
issue
in
the
briefs
before
the
illinois
supreme
court.
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
on
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
no,
we
were
in.
the
district
court
had
agreed
with
us.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
agreed
and
has
overruled
the
defense.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yields
to
1404.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
yes.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
well,
may
i
point
out
to
you
--
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
is
more,
sir,
than
a
question
of
illinois
law.
it
is
a
question
of
technique
under
the
erie
rule.
that
is,
do
you,
under
the
erie
rule,
mechanically
look
to
any
decisions
of
the
state
of
illinois?
is
there
no
craftsmanship,
no
technique
involved?
just
an
examination
in
the
state
law,
find
the
case,
and
if
it
not
been
changed
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
regardless
of
its
grounds,
you
follow
it.
that
is
not
only
a
question
of
the
application
of
illinois
law.
it
is
also
a
question
of
technique
under
the
erie
rule.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
well,
isn't
it
--
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
do
that
at
all.
it
didn't
evaluate.
it
didn't
evaluate
illinois
decisions.
mr.
maurice
rosenfield
it
stopped
with
a
decision
of
the
illinois
--
of
the
illinois
court
which
i
thought
was
applicable
without
evaluating
how
the
illinois
courts
would
decide
the
question
today.
thank
you,
sir.
i
thank
you.
