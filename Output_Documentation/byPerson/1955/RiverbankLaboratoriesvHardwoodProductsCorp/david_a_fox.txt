mr.
david
a.
fox
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
not
care
to
dwell
on
the
factual
situation,
but
mr.
justice
black
has
inquired
concerning
the
situation
in
illinois
and
the
matter
of
this
defendant's
activity
there.
it
is
true
that
a
piece
of
literature
which
is
in
exhibit
and
which
is
in
the
record
designates
the
chicago
office
of
the
defendant
as
the
acoustical
department.
but
the
record
is
unusually
complete
in
this
matter.
unusually
complete
whereas
question
of
this
sort
is
raised
on
a
preliminary
motion
and
the
record
shows
what
the
activity
was
actually
in
illinois.
they
had
an
agent,
a
mr.
hydeman,
who
was
the
agent
who
solicited
orders
to
be
forwarded
to
neenah,
to
be
filled
there.
in
connection
with
that,
he
sold
all
the
products
of
this
defendant
company,
both
acoustical
doors
and
a
great
deal
of
wood
mill
work
beyond
the
acoustical
doors.
mr.
david
a.
fox
as
an
actual
process
of
the
manner
of
soliciting
this
business,
contractors,
builders,
owners
of
projects,
which
require
building
materials,
were
persuaded
to
include
such
doors
in
their
specifications.
and
ordinarily,
the
salesman
didn't
get
an
order.
the
orders
were
placed
directly
with
neenah,
wisconsin.
once
the
person
with
responsibility
it
was
to
repair
the
specification,
had
decided
to
introduce
that
product
into
the
plan.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
didn't
use
any
printed
form
and
it
didn't
say
anything
on
the
back
of
it
because
we
didn't
have
any
--
all
of
the
orders
were
placed
on
stationary
that
the
customer
furnished.
his
order
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
or
they
purchased
order.
mr.
david
a.
fox
as
far
as
the
chicago
acoustical
department
did,
it
solicited
orders
for
both
acoustical
doors
and
for
all
kind
of
doors.
mr.
david
a.
fox
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
over
a
considerable
territory.
mr.
david
a.
fox
and
over
a
considerable
territory
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
it
extended
as
far
down
as
texas.
the
territory
varied
at
times
and
as
far
east
as
new
england.
mr.
david
a.
fox
and
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
would
say
that
it
might
have
reached
that
number
at
times.
it
was
a
part
of
a
total
territory
which
was
served
by
other
agents
of
the
company
as
well.
and
as
far
as
being
a
--
an
acoustical
department,
it
was
from
the
standpoint
of
solicitation
of
business
only.
we
did
--
there
was
no
manufacturing
facility,
no
stock
of
goods,
no
facility
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
no,
indeed.
this
man
was
a
subordinate
employee.
there
was
a
sales
manager
or
there
was
an
executive
officer
of
the
company
that
supervised
that
activity
at
neenah.
so
that
the
--
because
the
origination
of
this
designation
in
the
literature
of
this
acoustical
department
was
that
we
had
a
subordinate
here
who
became,
as
mr.
rosenfield
had
told
you,
quite
well
advised
in
acoustical
matters.
he
knew
more
than
his
superiors
did
in
certain
phases
of
that.
the
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
he'd
been
merely
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
he'd
been
in
--
he
had
been
with
the
defendant
company
for
30
years
more
or
less,
approximately.
mr.
david
a.
fox
pardon?
mr.
david
a.
fox
as
far
as
the
business
that
he
did
was
concerned,
it
was
done
in
chicago,
obviously.
mr.
david
a.
fox
he
lived
in
chicago.
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes.
that's
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes.
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes.
mr.
david
a.
fox
no,
indeed,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
if
the
illinois
rule
was
coincident
with
the
international
shoe
case,
it
wouldn't
be
the
slightest
question
and
i
wouldn't
be
here
today
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
arguing
this
matter.
mr.
david
a.
fox
and
i
think
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
--
that
i
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
no,
indeed.
mr.
david
a.
fox
there
was
adequate
presence
under
international
shoe
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
and
i
dont't
argue
the
point
at
all.
mr.
david
a.
fox
precisely.
mr.
david
a.
fox
the
bull
case
and
the
burroughs
case.
and
there,
your
honor
asked
a
question
which
i
believe
should
be
answered
here,
what
is
the
most
recent?
1931
is
the
answer
to
that
question.
now,
although
there
is
a
great
deal
of
water
under
the
bridges
since
1931
as
we've
heard
mentioned
here
today,
there
isn't
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
including
international
shoe
and
international
shoe
such
what
i
call
the
floor
and
then
they
indicates
that
the
ceiling
is
some
finite
and
perceptible
distance
above
the
floor
if
the
state
chooses
to
put
the
ceiling
there.
now,
i
believe
the
state
of
illinois
has
not
chosen
to
press
that
ceiling
against
the
floor
that
there
is
a
perceptible
and
a
substantial
space.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
illinois
cases
and
the
place
where
the
language
occurs
which
mr.
rosenfield
has
mentioned
as
in
this
pembleton
versus
illinois
commercial
men's
case
i
believe.
and
there,
if
a
problem
that
was
before
that
court
was
whether,
not
the
state
of
illinois
but
i
believe
it
was
a
state
in
nebraska
had
gone
below
the
floor,
so
to
speak,
that
was
then
defined
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
david
a.
fox
it
wasn't
--
pardon.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
said
the
peculiarity
of
that
decision
was
that
you
had
an
illinois
court
interpreting
a
nebraska
law.
and
it
pointed
out
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
no,
this
is
pembleton
versus
illinois
commercial
men's
case.
it
was
pointed
out
there
that
the
state
of
illinois
and
nebraska
too
had
to
give
heat
to
this
lower
limit
which
there
i
refer
to
as
the
floor.
and
it
was
that
that
was
referred
to
and
not
the
opposite
because
the
question
in
that
case
was
whether
a
judgment
obtained
in
the
state
of
nebraska
could
be
enforced
in
the
state
of
illinois
where
the
jurisdictional
facts
did
not
satisfy
that
then
existing
recognized
requirements
as
to
due
process.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
was
trying
to
–
perhaps,
i
did
not
make
a
claim
that
that
language
which
occurs
in
those
illinois
decisions
when
they
were
attempting
to
locate
the
floor,
not
the
ceiling.
they
were
coping
with
the
question
of
whether
a
state
had
gone
beyond
what
was
permissible
under
the
constitution
to
take
jurisdiction
of
a
defendant.
that's
the
point
i
was
attempting
to
make,
is
that
you
cannot
apply
that
language
too
freely
to
the
question
of
whether
the
state
might
choose
to
have
a
gap
between
the
two
requirements.
mr.
david
a.
fox
well,
i
am
not
able
to
add
logic
and
reason
to
any
such
observation
if
it
was
made.
i
--
i
would
say
that
the
state
can
go
beyond,
and
that
they
have
practically
all
of
them
gone
beyond.
there's
very
few
who
have
not
on
this
question
of
doing
business,
and
i
would
say
this.
mr.
david
a.
fox
no,
indeed.this
is
a
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
this
is
a
theoretical
argument.
i
do
not
know
the
decision,
mr.
justice
black
that
holds
such
a
thing.
mr.
david
a.
fox
1948.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
would
say
no.
it
was
not
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
a.
fox
it's
a
question
of
venue
and
there
isn't
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes.
mr.
david
a.
fox
it's
a
question
of
federal
statute
and
i
wish
to
point
out
that
this
matter
is
brought
here.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
would
say
that
it's
an
affirmative
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
affirmative
question
if
it's
procedural
without
that
aspect
that
would
be
true,
but
we
have
a
section
of
the
statute
to
be
construed
and
i'm
in
complete
disagreement
with
my
opponent
here
as
to
the
applicable
statute.
i
say
it
is
section
1391
(c)
and
that
section
states,
“a
corporation
may
be
sued
in
any
judicial
district
in
which
it
is
incorporated
or
licensed
to
do
business
or
is
doing
business.
and
such
judicial
district
shall
be
regarded
as
the
residence
of
such
corporation
for
venue
purposes.”
now,
the
federal
jurisdiction
in
diversity
situations
as
well
in
--
as
in
federal
question
cases,
being
founded
as
it
is
on
the
constitution
is
such
that
if
congress
had
so
intended,
it
had
the
power
to
grant
nationwide
jurisdiction
of
all
classes
of
litigants
to
each
and
every
district
court,
federal
district
court.
now,
congress
saw
fit
to
specify
the
geographical
locations
of
term
of
residents
or
litigants
where
these
cases
should
be
brought,
and
it
would
be
to
deny
the
scope
and
effect
of
this
broad
federal
jurisdictional
power,
rather
than
to
strengthen
it
to
say
that
congress
didn't
have
the
right
to
make
that
decision.
and
in
this
instance,
we
have
a
section
of
the
statute
which
is
directly
applicable
that
says,
“a
corporation
can
be
sued
where
it's
incorporated,”
and
that
is
directly
a
question
of
state
law
as
to
be
ascertained
in
that
fashion
only
where
it
is
licensed
to
do
business,
which
is
also
a
question
of
state
law
to
be
ascertained
and
like
other
or
where
it
is
doing
the
business.
and
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
that
section
of
the
statute
which
is
a
part
of
the
judicial
code,
which
came
into
being
in
1948,
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
mr.
justice
douglas
were
on
the
committee,
conferred
the
connection
with
that
thing,
and
no
doubt
perhaps
even
gave
attention
to
this
particular
part
of
the
enactment.
the
phrase,
“doing
business”
had
a
very
definite
specific
technical
meaning,
which
had
been
acquired
in
the
light
of
these
state
rules.
now,
let's
say
the
state
rules
had
been
abducted
under
a
misapprehension
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
it
meant
that
degree
of
activity
which
each
individual
state
decided
without
contravening
the
due
process
requirements
of
the
constitution
was
sufficient
for
their
purposes
to
take
jurisdiction
of
a
formed
corporation.
mr.
david
a.
fox
the
only
authority
i
have
on
the
point
is
through
a
reason.
here
was
a
phrase
having
the
existing
technical
meaning
throughout
the
bar
and
throughout
the
decisions
relating
to
the
subject.
in
1948,
where
this
carefully
worked
over
provision
of
the
judicial
code
employs
it.
there
had
been
no
comprehensive
revision
of
the
code
since
1911,
and
a
great
deal
of
attention
was
applied
in
bringing
that
up
to
the
best
standards
possible,
and
congress
drew
on
every
source
available
and
had
a
great
deal
of
assistance.
now,
i
have
been
able
to
find
nothing
in
a
way
that
debate
would
indicate
that,
but
certainly,
we
come
here
now
and
say,
“is
there
a
superimpose
on
this
rule?”
is
there
a
superimpose
over
the
rules
of
the
states,
a
broad
general
definition
of
doing
business?
i
say
no.
if
congress
had
meant
and
had
intended
that
a
corporation,
a
foreign
corporation
under
the
circumstances
such
as
we
have
here
was
to
be
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
from
the
basis
of
the
test
of
international
shoe,
it
would
have
been
a
very
simple
matter
to
say
so
in
the
legislation.
mr.
david
a.
fox
prior
to
1948,
there
was
somewhat
of
an
enigma
in
the
law.
corporations
had
not
been
mentioned
at
all
in
connection
with
this
type
of
legislation.
everything
was
phrased
in
terms
of
natural
persons
and
everything
was
made
dependent
upon
the
decision
of
law
which
had
been
developed
and
first
granted
a
corporation,
the
equivalent
of
citizenship.
finally,
it
had
been
elaborated
into
the
question
of
residents
and
finding
to
the
question
of
whether
it
could
migrate.
now,
if
we
are
to
search
for
a
meaning
for
the
phrase,
i'd
say
we
have
to
take
it
against
that
background.
and
the
background
had
fully
evolved
then,
had
developed
a
meaning
for
the
term
which
is
specific
in
each
state
and
quite
definite
there.
now,
as
i
say,
need
we
investigate
under
what
misapprehension
the
state
may
have
adapted
the
rule
if
the
rule
is
satisfactory
to
the
state?
and
many
very
advantageous
provisions
no
doubt
are
in
the
law
and
are
retained
in
the
law
today
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
their
origin
might
be
open
to
some
criticisms
such
as
been
made
here
in
this
question.
mr.
david
a.
fox
directly
prior
to
the
recess,
your
honor
had
a
question
which
i
had
--
had
neglected
to
answer.
we
believe
you
had
asked
what
authority
i
had
in
my
assertion
that
congress
had
utilized
this
term
in
a
technical
sense.
mr.
david
a.
fox
perhaps,
i
would
have
had
reverted
to
the
language
of
enactment
that
existed
before
1948,
where
the
word
"found"
was
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
the
word
found
was
utilized.
there
was
an
ambiguity
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes,
whether
--
whether
a
party
maybe
found,
originally,
the
enactment
had
referred
to
the
residents
of
the
plaintiff,
i
believe,
and
the
place
where
the
defendant
was
found
and
there
had
been
difficulty
in
trying
to
reconcile
those
two
different
terms
used
apparently
for
the
same
purpose.
and
if
they
had
intended
that
it'd
be
a
mere
matter
of
the
place
where
found,
then
it
would
have
abolished
the
word
residents
entirely
and
to
put
the
defendants
entirely
on
the
word
found.
that's
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
that
i
believe
is
the
logical
conclusion
and
i
believe
that
although
this
case
presents
a
narrower
point
and
this
is
involved
in
a
diversity
situation
in
the
erie
doctrine
is
present
that
that
when
a
question
does
arise,
it
may
have
to
be
considered
as
even
in
the
federal
case
as
long
as
section
1391
(c)
remains
in
its
present
form.
that
question
may
have
to
be
decided
as
well
is
whether
the
state
rule,
the
technical
meaning
of
doing
business
is
using
that
language
will
be
applicable
in
a
federal
question
case.now
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
i'd
say
that
on
this
ground,
your
honor,
that
the
basis
of
a
doctrine
of
erie
versus
tompkins
is
that
there
is
not
and
that
doctrine
renounces
the
existence
of
some
kind
of
a
super
distilled
over
dominating
law
where
the
question
is
one,
which
is
ordinarily
decided
by
the
states.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
would
say
that
it
could
be
treated
as
procedural.
i
--
i
would
think
that
would
be
the
natural
category
using
that
term
in
its
technical
meaning.
but
under
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
the
state
rule
as
it
effects
this
procedural
question
should
apply.
now,
it
is
not
procedural
in
the
sense
of
the
manner
in
which
the
court
has
conducted.
it
is
a
right,
which
is
--
has
its
outcome
determinative
effect
and
the
doctrine
of
erie
versus
tompkins
has
its
vitality
because
of
the
versatility
that
it
has.
and
that
drives
out
versatility,
i
believe,
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
this
court
has
not
have
difficulty
over
this
simple
distinction
between
substantive
and
procedural.
it
went
to
the
fact
of
what
would
happen
and
whether
or
not
the
case
would
have
preceded
in
the
state
court
or
whether
it
would
not
have
proceeded
in
the
state
court.
and
the
decisions
have
made
it
plain
that
it
is
--
that
is
the
result
of
this
to
be
the
criterion
and
not
any
narrow
question
of
technical
meaning.
the
--
the
importance
here
in
this
case
of
not
adopting
an
exception
to
the
erie
rule
has
very
plainly
brought
out
by
the
fact
that
you
can
treat
this
thing
if
you
want
under
a
technical
term
of
procedure
but
the
result
would
be
diametrically
opposite.
the
case
would
proceed
in
the
federal
court
while
they
block
down
the
street
and
the
state
court
case
would
be
dismissed.
and
that
is
a
sort
of
thing
erie
doctrine
is
applicable
to.
and
as
i
say,
the
vitality
of
a
doctrine
has
always
depended
upon
the
versatility
that
this
court
has
been
able
to
give
to
it
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
any
difficulty
at
all
in
applying
the
general
principle
of
the
doctrine
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
fox
if
i
understand
the
new
enactment
that
has
come
into
effect
in
illinois
now
as
of
the
first
of
the
year
in
which
mr.
rosenfield
has
made
reference,
that
a
nonresident
can
be
sued
under
the
--
so,
in
fact,
is
called
in
the
state
of
illinois
now
only
if
four
categories
of
matters
are
involved.
first,
if
there
is
a
transaction
out
of
which
the
cause
of
action
arose
which
occurred
in
illinois.
second,
if
there
is
property
located
in
illinois
which
is
involved.
third,
is
whether
there
is
a
tort
committed
in
illinois
and
fourth,
whether
there
is
a
contract
of
insurance
insuring
a
risk
in
illinois.
mr.
david
a.
fox
now,
this
is
the
new
illinois
rule
effective
as
of
the
first
of
the
year.
mr.
david
a.
fox
and
it
provides
interestingly
enough
that
whether
the
party
is
a
resident
of
illinois
or
not
can
be
sued
in
those
four
categories.
but
if
the
defendant
is
a
nonresident
and
the
action
doesn't
fall
in
the
four
categories,
the
state
of
illinois,
in
order
to
avoid
the
crowding
of
its
courts,
does
not
want
to
have
to
entertain
those
suits.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
believe
so.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
fox
in
this
case,
that
we
had
no
agent
in
illinois
that
was
performing
any
such
function.
this
was
a
man
who
solicited
orders
only.
mr.
david
a.
fox
he
had
on
occasion
have
been
called
upon
because
of
complaints,
he
would
go
and
find
out
what
the
customers
complaint
was
and
report
that
to
the
home
office
and
then
it
would
be
attended
to
under
directions
from
the
home
office.
he
was
not
--
he
had
no
kit
or
tools.
he
was
not
a
mechanic.
he
--
he
did
not
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
no,
i
say
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
he
did
not
engage
in
that.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
don't
think
there
was
a
positive
prohibition,
no,
but
he
did
not
engage
in
that
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
it
was
expected
of
him
to
do
that
either.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
--
i
suppose
that
if
he
had
the
authority
to
give
such
advice
and
gave
it
that
that
would
be
the
case,
but
that
is
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes,
indeed.
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
your
honor,
certainly,
to
the
extent
that
the
man
knew
the
subject
matter,
he
might
give
such
advise
but
he
--
there
is
no
record
--
instance
in
this
record
where
it
engaged
in
that
kind
of
an
activity.
mr.
david
a.
fox
he
specified
--
he
assisted
architects
in
specifying
the
doors
and,
of
course,
he
was
not
a
registered
architect
and
he
was
not
one
who
could
take
responsibility
for
that
sort
of
a
thing
under
any
licensing
law
with
reference
to
engineers
and
architects
that
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
he
did
refer
it
back
to
the
home
office.
mr.
david
a.
fox
there
were
others
in
the
company
besides
his
superiors.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
--
i
didn't
want
to
leave
the
impression.
he
was
the
person
in
the
company
that
knew
all
there
was
to
know
about
this.
there's
no
--
no
one
else.
i
said
certain
of
his
superiors
knew
less
than
he
did
about
this.
but
there
are
others
in
the
company
who
were
the
experts
in
the
acoustical
manufacturer
of
these
doors.
that
was
all
done
in
this
concept.
and
he
did
as
a
fact
referred
back
to
the
home
office.
he
--
he
was
a
mere
messenger
in
that
regard
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
and
i'm
going
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
to
get
this
complaint.
mr.
david
a.
fox
well,
this
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
that
is
--
that
is
certainly
true,
your
honor.
the
--
the
question
that
i
was
answering
was
when
--
in
a
case
of
a
complaint,
how
did
he
function.
and
this
is
not
in
the
question
of
a
complaint,
but
in
a
question
of
selecting
the
doors
in
the
first
instance
that
he
was
advised
--
advising
architects.
there
is
one
instance
in
the
record
that
is
typical
here
where
the
--
the
navy
had
--
some
of
these
doors
and
they
were
having
difficulty
with
sound
passing
through
and
he
called
upon
the
facilities
of
the
plaintiff
here
to
furnish
the
expert
to
go
and
actually
analyze
what
was
wrong.
mr.
david
a.
fox
on
page
103
of
the
record,
he
was
asked
the
question
in
the
adjustment
of
a
complaint,
“did
you
ever
have
any
authority
to
refund
the
customer
of
any
money?”
answer“oh,
no.”
“any
adjustment
of
any
complaint
that
you
have
the
authority
to
replace
the
merchandise
with
a
new
door?
answer
“not
unless
it
was
part
of,
not
unless
it
was
approved
by
the
main
office.”
it
might
be
a
suggestion
i
made
but
approval
would
have
to
come
in
the
main
office
to
do
it.
that
is
the
witness,
hydeman
himself.
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes.
mr.
david
a.
fox
the
--
the
mere
circumstances
of
--
of
his
activity,
he
was
a
salesman,
he
was
to
obtain
the
taking
of
these
orders
and
sending
them
all
to
neenah.
when
a
complaint
came
from
a
customer
that
--
that
a
door
that
he
--
that
had
been
furnished
didn't
come
up
to
expectations,
as
the
court
below
seemed
to
indicate
that
that
was
ancillary
to
salesmanship
of
a
poorly
satisfied
customer,
one
who
would
ignore
and
not
respond
to
would
be
the
worst
kind
of
sales
tactics.
and
so
the
man
would
go
and
find
out
what
the
complaint
was
and
then
that
would
be
referred
to
the
home
office.
mr.
david
a.
fox
probably
to
neenah,
to
the
--
to
the
home
office.
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
for
this
instance,
but
the
people
that
this
man,
hydeman,
was
personally
in
contact
would
--
would
probably
go
to
him.
mr.
david
a.
fox
that
--
that
may
well
be,
your
honor,
but
i
say
that
--
that
the
record
shows
what
the
activity
was.
this
piece
of
literature
describes
something
that
cannot
be
determined
from
mere
terminology
used.
you
have
to
go
and
see
what
was
this
man's
activity
and
that
is
very
thoroughly
detailed
in
the
record.
and
it
shows
that
his
activity
was
essentially,
primarily
the
solicitation
of
orders
to
be
accepted
at
neenah.
these
other
things
such
as
in
acoustical
department
if
your
honor
call
that
or
ancillary
to
that
main
duty
and
then
the
bull
case.
there
were
factors
ancillary
to
the
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
main
purpose
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
i'll
make
the
summary
much
more
brief
than
that.
this
is
a
case
that
comes
under
section
1391
(c)
of
the
statute.
it
involves
venue.
the
federal
jurisdictional
power
is
not
challenged.
it
exists.
the
mere
fact
that
it
exists
does
not
mean
that
it
has
to
be
exercised.
the
first
reason
that
the
term
doing
business
is
to
be
interpreted
as
we
suggest
is
that
the
enactment
itself
and
circumstances
surrounding
it
indicate
that
congress
intended
that
the
technical
meaning
that
had
been
attributed
to
the
term
should
apply.
second,
the
decisions
which
i
have
not
mentioned
but
which
are
mentioned
in
the
brief
in
the
lower
courts
uniformly
wherever
they
have
actually
considered
the
question
have
come
to
the
conclusion
of
the
principle
of
erie
versus
tompkins
applies.
and
third,
it's
important
not
to
introduce
a
major
exception
to
the
doctrine
of
erie
versus
tompkins.
and
this
case
can
easily
be
comprehended
within
that
doctrine
because
of
the
versatility
of
the
doctrine.
mr.
david
a.
fox
you
mean
how
that
section
apply
to
it,
your
honor?
it
would,
of
course,
apply
to
any
case
brought
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
david
a.
fox
and
the
question
is
would
this
case
be
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
tried
in
illinois
under
that
section.
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes.
mr.
david
a.
fox
no.
my
answer
is
no
and
the
reason
--
the
answer
is
no
that
this
defendant
here
does
all
of
its
manufacturing
--
mr.
david
a.
fox
--
in
neenah,
wisconsin.
mr.
david
a.
fox
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes
because
the
new
sealing
though
with
that
section
that
you're
referring
to,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes.
mr.
david
a.
fox
the
--
the
thing
that
is
an
issue
must
arise
out
of
the
transaction
in
the
state.
mr.
david
a.
fox
yes,
arising
from
the
doing
of
any
of
these
acts
is
the
purpose
to
those
four
categories
is
that
illinois
wants
to
take
cognizance
only
if
the
transaction
out
of
which
the
cause
of
action
arises.
mr.
david
a.
fox
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
fox
not
out
of
which
this
cause
of
action
arose.
it
hasn't
--
there
hasn't
been
shown
to
be
any.
can
you
see
this?
the
defendant
practically,
the
date
the
patent
expired
was
enjoined
preliminarily
in
using
this
word.
mr.
david
a.
fox
i
think
it
is.
it's
just
those
four
categories
that
are
permissible.
