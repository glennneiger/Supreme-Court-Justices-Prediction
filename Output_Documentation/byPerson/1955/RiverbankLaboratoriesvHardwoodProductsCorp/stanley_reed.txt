how
--
how
did
this
question
arise?
justice
stanley
reed
is
there
any
written
reply
of
yours
to
that?
justice
stanley
reed
where
is
your
â€“
where
is
your
written
reply?
justice
stanley
reed
no,
no,
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
they
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
that
they
were
not
before
the
court.
justice
stanley
reed
whatever
words
they
used,
i
don't
know.
justice
stanley
reed
well
now,
what
--
what
did
you
file
in
the
court
in
answer
to
that?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
did
you
file
nothing?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that's
evidence.
justice
stanley
reed
did
you
take
any
procedural
step
in
answer?
did
you
file
an
answer
to
the
motion
that
they
file?
justice
stanley
reed
showing
certain
facts?
justice
stanley
reed
and
then,
did
you
file
a
brief?
justice
stanley
reed
and
you
raised
what
sort
of
a
question
then?
how
would
you
raise
this
question?
how
did
you
raise
it?
justice
stanley
reed
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
say
--
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you
didn't
say
to
--
that
the
position
of
the
defendant
would
be
contrary
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
stanley
reed
but
in
the
international
shoe
case,
the
international
shoe
company
was
taken
into
the
state
and
they
raised
a
question
that
it
was
contrary
to
the
federal
constitution
for
such
a
denial
of
due
process
as
to
make
them
come
where
they've
never
been.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
very
present
situation
from
what
you
have
here,
is
it?
justice
stanley
reed
that
whether
a
person
is
doing
business
in
the
state
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
this
--
this
illinois
citizen
could
go
to
the
state
of
the
residence
of
the
foreign
corporation
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
and
be
in
federal
court?
justice
stanley
reed
why
should
this
go
just
as
much
as
the
foreign
corporation
should
come
to
him?
justice
stanley
reed
there's
no
--
there's
no
distinction.
justice
stanley
reed
how
--
how
do
you
distinguish
the
ragan
case?
justice
stanley
reed
where
--
where
did
you
first
raise
this
federal
question,
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
and
you
raised
it
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
when
you
came
here?
justice
stanley
reed
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
argued
in
the
illinois'
court?
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
what
it
had
been?
because
you
were
out,
weren't
you?
justice
stanley
reed
oh,
the
district
court
agreed
with
you?
justice
stanley
reed
it
first
came
up
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stanley
reed
you're
talking
about
international
shoe?
