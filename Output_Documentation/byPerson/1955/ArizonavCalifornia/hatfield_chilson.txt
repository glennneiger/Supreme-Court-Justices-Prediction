mr.
hatfield
chilson
if
the
court
please,
due
to
the
limitations
of
time,
i've
been
requested
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the
four
upper
basin
states
of
colorado,
wyoming,
utah,
and
new
mexico.
i
wish
to
state
first
that
i've
been
authorized
on
behalf
of
utah
and
new
mexico,
who,
by
the
master's
report,
had
been
recommended
to
be
made
parties
to
this
action
in
their
lower
basin
capacities.
i've
been
authorized
to
say
that
utah
and
new
mexico
do
not
accept
to
the
master's
report.
therefore,
i
may
present
this
case
in
this
light
that
in
the
upper
basin
capacities,
colorado,
wyoming,
utah,
and
new
mexico
have
identical
interest.
so,
during
this
argument,
when
i
refer
to
the
upper
states
or
the
upper
basin
states
or
the
states
of
the
upper
division,
i
will
be
referring
to
those
four
states
in
their
upper
basin
capacities.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
i'm
speaking
for
all
four
of
them.
mr.
callister,
attorney
general
of
utah,
mr.
wilson,
special
assistant
attorney
general
of
new
mexico,
and
mr.
george
guy,
attorney
general
of
wyoming,
have
asked
me
to
do
that.
first,
let
me
say
that
the
upper
basin
states
are
most
jealous
of
their
water
rights.
colorado
in
particular
has
evidenced
that
by
much
litigation
in
this
court.
if
we
felt
that
we
had
a
real
estate
in
this
lawsuit,
we
would
not
have
to
be
requested
to
be
here.
we
would
be
clamoring
to
get
in.
i
would
like,
if
i
can,
briefly,
to
tell
you
why
we
think
we
have
no
state
in
this
particular
lawsuit.
as
it's
been
stated
here,
the
colorado
river
compact
did
only
one
thing
about
division
of
water.
it
divided
water
between
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin.
it
did
not
divide
the
water
use
within
either
basin.
so,
when
i
speak
of
the
upper
basin
share
of
the
waters,
i
speak
of
the
water
use
to
which
the
upper
basin
is
entitled
under
the
colorado
river
compact,
and
when
i
speak
of
the
lower
basin
share,
i
will
be
referring
to
the
lower
basin
share
of
the
waters
under
the
compact.
now,
as
i
said,
the
compact
made
no
division
of
water
use
within
either
basin.
the
framers
of
the
compact
left
that
as
a
future
matter
to
be
determined
as
an
internal
affair
between
each
basin.
in
1948,
the
upper
states,
following
the
spirit
of
the
compact,
got
together
by
agreement
and
made
a
division
of
the
upper
basin
share
among
the
upper
basin
states.
now,
at
that
time,
the
upper
states
faced
essentially
the
same
problems
which
the
lower
basin
is
now
facing,
because
the
lower
basin
has
been
unable
to
agree
on
a
division
of
the
lower
basin
share.
so,
they
have
come
into
this
court
and
asked
the
court
to
do
by
judicial
decree,
what
the
upper
states
did
by
agreement
in
the
form
of
the
upper
colorado
river
basin
compact.
therefore,
the
essential
and
only
purpose
of
this
action,
if
the
court
please,
is
a
division
of
the
lower
basin
water
use.
it's
not
to
determine
how
much
water
the
lower
basin
is
entitled
to
because
that
has
already
been
determined
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
we
have
divided
the
pie
by
the
compact.
the
lower
basin
has
its
share.
the
lower
basin
states
are
now
involved
in
trying
to
cut
up
their
share
among
the
lower
basin
states.
now,
the
claims
of
the
parties
show
that,
i
want
to
emphasize
that,
arizona
by
its
complaint
is
not
claiming
one
drop
of
water
out
of
the
colorado
river
system,
except
such
as
the
lower
basin
is
entitled
under
the
colorado
river
compact.
and
then,
her
claim,
she
states
that
the
waters
to
which
she
is
entitled
are
subject
to
the
availability
of
that
water
to
the
lower
basin.
now,
there
--
they
are
attempting
to
divide
it
in
specific
amounts
of
acre
feet.
the
upper
basin
realized
that
the
flow
of
any
stream
varies.
the
negotiators
of
the
compact
thought
they
were
dealing
with
20,000,000
acre
feet
per
annum.
it
now
appears
at
least
over
a
long
period
of
time
that
the
supply
of
the
river
is
materially
less,
somewhere
around
15,000,000,
16,000,000
acre
feet
perhaps.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
mr.
justice,
in
the
--
in
the
aired
west,
no
one
can
make
any
insurance
as
to
what
the
future
stream
flow
is
going
to
be.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
even
for
10
years,
and
that's
the
reason
that
the
upper
basin
states
tried
to
be
realistic
about
this
thing,
and
--
and
they
divided
the
upper
basin
share
in
percentages.
if
there's
no
water,
you
get
nothing.
if
there's
a
100
acre
feet,
you
get
your
share.
if
there's
a
20,000,000
acre
feet,
you
still
get
your
percentage
share.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
among
the
forums.
now
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
by
percentages,
the
upper
basin
compact,
except
for
one
instance.arizona
has
a
little
area
in
the
upper
basin.
we
allocated
arizona
50,000
acre
feet.
the
rest
of
it
is
divided
in
percentages.
colorado
gets
51%
and
75%
of
the
upper
basin
share.
utah
gets
a
percentage
and
wyoming
a
percentage.
now,
california,
of
course,
contends
that
in
this
action
to
divide
lower
basin
water
use
that
we
are
necessary
parties.
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
review
the
four
principle
contentions.
that
is
there
the
four
principle
contentions
of
california
as
i
understand
it.
now,
the
first
is
that
this
is
an
action
on
a
contract
that
the
contract
is
the
colorado
river
compact,
and
that
since
we
are
parties
to
the
compact,
therefore,
we're
necessary
parties.
the
second
principle
contention
is
not
to
avoid
litigation
in
the
future.
this
court
should
anticipate
the
possible
areas
of
conflict
between
the
two
basins
and
decide
them
on
this
action.
the
third
principle
contention
is
that
the
determination
of
the
issues
which
have
to
be
determined
to
divide
the
lower
basin
share
of
the
water
are
such
that
the
upper
states'
interest
are
affected
and
no
effective
decree
can
be
entered
without
their
presence.
and
the
fourth
is
that
the
claims
of
the
united
states
require
the
presence
of
the
upper
states.
now,
let
me
refer
first
to
this
contention
that
this
is
an
action
on
the
colorado
river
compact.
we
most
seriously
contend
that
this
is
not
an
action
on
the
colorado
river
compact.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
compact
does
one
thing.
it
divides
the
water
use
of
the
river
between
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin.
it
makes
no
division
into
our
basin
and
that
was
by
intent.
the
negotiators
of
the
compact
by
intent
limited
this
division
between
the
two
basins.
therefore,
this
action
to
divide
the
lower
basin
water
use
is
an
action
to
determine
a
matter
of
side
scope
of
the
compact,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
an
action
on
the
compact.
and
in
such
a
division,
whether
it
be
on
the
upper
basin
or
the
lower
basin,
the
division
of
interbasin
water
use
is
an
internal
affair,
which
does
not
require
the
acquiescence
or
the
presence
of
the
states
of
the
upper
basins.
now,
that
principle
has
been
recognized
on
several
occasions,
your
honors.
the
first
was
--
it
was
recognized
by
the
negotiators
of
the
compact,
the
commission
which
--
which
negotiated
the
compact.
and
i
refer
to
the
hoover
dam
documents
which
gave
the
history
of
the
negotiation
and
we'll
quote
just
briefly.
participants
has
stated
that
the
negotiations
would
have
broken
up
but
for
mr.
hoover's
proposal,
that
the
commission
limit
its
efforts
to
a
division
of
water
between
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin
leaving
to
each
basin
the
future
internal
allocation
of
its
share.
it
was
also
the
same
principle
that
the
states
of
one
basin
are
not
necessary
parties
to
the
division
of
water
use
within
the
other
basin.
it
was
also
recognized
by
the
congress
and
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
by
section
4
(a)
of
that
act,
they
authorized
arizona,
california
and
nevada
to
enter
into
an
agreement
for
the
division
of
the
lower
basin
share
of
the
waters.
the
congress
did
not
require
the
participation
of
the
upper
states
in
that
agreement
or
that
the
upper
states
acquiesce
therein.
the
congress
treated
it
as
an
internal
affair
between
those
parties.
and
it
was
recognized
again
in
the
negotiation
and
ratification
of
the
upper
colorado
river
basin
compact.
when
the
congress
consented
to
that
compact,
they
did
not
require
that
california
and
arizona
had
to
acquiesce
therein
or
had
to
participate
in
the
negotiations
or
had
to
ratify.
it
was
treated
by
everyone
that
it
is
an
internal
affair
which
they
can
take
care
between
themselves.
now,
less
there
be
any
misunderstanding,
if
the
court
please.
i'd
like
to
say
right
here
that
if
the
time
should
come
that
the
lower
basin
states
come
into
this
court
and
say
the
lower
basin
of
the
river
is
being
deprived
of
water
because
the
terms
of
the
upper
basin
compact
are
such
and
the
operation
under
the
upper
basin
compact
is
such.
that
it
is
depriving
us
of
water
under
the
colorado
river
compact,
the
upper
states
are
going
to
have
to
face
that
issue
and
they're
going
to
have
to
litigate
it.
now,
i'll
give
the
court
an
example
here
shortly
of
what
i
mean.
it
seems
--
it
seems
fair
to
us
therefore
that
this
is
not
an
action
on
the
compact,
but
it's
an
internal
affair
for
each
basin
and
that
we're
not
necessary
parties.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
second
principal
contention
and
that
is
that
this
court
should
anticipate
possible
areas
of
conflict
between
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin
and
to
avoid
suits
in
the
future
decide
them
in
this
particular
litigation.
now,
the
master
found
that
there
was
no
justiciable
controversy
between
the
upper
states
and
the
parties
to
this
cost,
and
that
whatever
the
possibility
of
a
future
controversy
may
be,
there
exists
no
sound
equitable
reason
for
now
joining
the
upper
states
in
this
litigation.
and
we
believe
that
the
findings
of
the
master
are
justified
because
there
is
no
allegation
anywhere
that
the
upper
states
are
exceeding
their
rights
or
evading
their
obligations
under
the
compact.
now,
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
upper
states
under
the
compact
are
relatively
simple
and
that
the
--
the
principle
right
they
have
is
to
--
is
the
apportionment
by
article
iii
(a)
in
perpetuity
to
beneficially
consume
7,500,000
acre
feet
of
water
per
annum.
their
principal
obligations
are
two.
under
article
iii
(d),
the
upper
states
are
not
to
deplete
the
flow
of
the
river
below
at
lee's
ferry,
below
75,000,000
acre
feet
in
each
10-year
period.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
if
the
court
please,
at
that
time,
there
will
be
undoubtedly
an
innervation
conflict.
the
lower
basin
will
--
will
take
one
stand
and
of
course
we
will
take
the
stand
which
is
most
favorable
to
us.
and
if
that
time
comes,
unless
it
can
be
adjusted
by
negotiation
between
the
interested
parties,
i
assume
that
this
court
will
have
to
decide
what
will
happen.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
no
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
we
have
no
fear
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
we
have
no
fear
of
--
of
such
a
decree,
your
honor,
because
they're
just
dividing
their
share
if
the
--
if
the
flow
of
the
river
over
a
period
of
years
should
--
let's
take
a
very
extreme
case.
should
--
i
can't
think
of
the
word,
produce
only
5,000,000
acre
feet,
then
surely,
neither
basins
can
get
7,500,000
out
of
a
5,000,000
acre-foot
supply.
what
the
division
will
be
under
those
circumstances
is
a
matter
either
for
a
negotiation
or
litigation
when
that
happens.
but
until
that
time
happens,
i
see
no
reason
for
attempting
to
foresee
that
situation
and
try
and
decide
it
in
this
action
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
we
wouldn't
be
here
in
this
capacity.
we
would
be
here,
your
honor,
asking
to
get
into
this
lawsuit.
and
we
all
as
well
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
well,
let
me
put
it
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
oh,
i
--
i
was
going
to
say
i
can
get
out
of
it
that
way,
are
used
at
the
present
time
including
what
is
called
commitment
that
is
projects
that
are
so
far
along
that
the
waters
committed
this
2,500,000
acre
feet
per
annum.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
yes.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
2,500,000.
now,
mr.
frank
spoke
of
this
reclamation
project
that
we're
asking
congress
for
it.
if
we
are
successful
in
getting
that
depending
on
the
details
of
the
plant,
we'll
have
a
1,000,000
to
a
1,700,000
acre
feet
of
consumptive
use
which
might
possibly
bring
our
total
use
up
to
4,200,000
of
the
7,500,000.
and
that
will
take
according
to
the
bureau's
estimates,
approximately
33
years
to
construct
that
reclamation
project.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
i
can
go
in
to
that
now,
your
honor,
if
you
wish.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
i
was
going
to
come
to
it
later.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
well,
but
that's
too
dangerous
to
our
rights.
we
--
we
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
i'm
afraid
that
we
would
feel
that
any
action
taken
would
be
so
persuasive
in
future
litigation
that
we
could
not
afford
this
to
stay
out
because
these
--
these
water
rights,
the
colorado
river
is
the
last
major
source
supply
of
water,
your
honor,
for
the
development
of
most
of
that
upper
region.
i
mean
from
now
on
forever.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
if
this
claim
were
against
the
river
system
rather
than
against
the
lower
basin
share
under
the
compact,
we
would
feel
that
way
i
am
sure.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
well,
yes,
i
think
we
thought
very
carefully
about
this
thing,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
we
are
convinced.
let
me
--
let
me
turn
now
to
this
second
class
of
question
again
that
we
should
foresee
the
future
just
as
an
example
of
one
of
the
things
that
california
wants
to
determine.
they
say
that
at
some
time
in
the
future,
the
upper
basin
may
so
increase
its
uses
or
so
utilize
its
water
that
it
will
affect
the
quality
of
the
water
delivered
at
lee's
ferry
and
therefore,
california
will
be
deprived
of
some
right
which
it
claims
under
the
compact.
now,
the
compact
does
--
doesn't
mention
quality
of
water,
but
for
the
purpose
here,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
let's
assume
that
it
does.
california
does
not
say
that
we
are
affecting
the
quality
of
the
water
at
lee's
ferry.
they
say
that
we
may
at
some
time
in
the
future
do
so.
and
i
use
that
as
an
illustration
to
try
and
--
and
tell
the
court
why
it
misses
the
matter
of
so
great
importance
to
us.
we
feel
it
would
be
very
prejudicial
to
the
upper
states
to
have
to
litigate
its
interbasin
rights
and
obligations
upon
assumptions
and
conjecture
of
a
fact
situation
that
may
--
may
or
may
not
exist
many
years
in
the
future.
colorado
has
had
very
bitter
experience
where
this
matter
of
attempting
to
foresee
the
future
in
interstate
stream
matters
and
it
--
it
hasn't
been
good
on
the
whole,
and
we
--
we
think
that
really
that
it
is
very
prejudicial.
the
courts
have
many
times
pointed
out
the
value
of
the
fact
situation
which
exist
in
determining
rights
and
obligations
such
as
these
and
we
say
we
are
entitled
to
a
fact
situation
where
california
or
the
lower
basin
can
say
to
us,
“you
are
now
doing
something
which
is
depriving
us
of
some
right
which
we
claim
under
the
compact.”
i
won't
labor
that
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that
was
the
purpose
california
recites
in
the
joinder
motion
is
the
determination
of
all
of
these
easy
questions
of
interpretation
of
interbasin
rights
and
obligations
under
the
compact.
now,
i
don't
misunderstand
it.
that
isn't
the
only
basis
for
their
motion
but
it's
one
of
the
contentions
to
their
motion.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
no,
interbasin.
that's
between
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
well,
now,
we
--
we
don't
believe
in
this
case.
there
are
any
interbasin
questions.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
yes.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
well,
of
course,
we've
been
intrigued
by
california's
concern
for
our
prayers.
[laughter]
i
would
--
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
next
point
which
may
answer
it
in
some
respect
without
being
fastidious
about
it,
and
that
is
the
third
contention
that
there
are
in
this
case
to
divide
the
water
use
within
the
lower
basin,
there
are
certain
issues.
the
determination
of
which
are
going
to
affect
our
rights,
and
time
doesn't
permit
a
detailed
discussion.
we've
done
it
in
our
briefs,
but
let
me
--
let
me
just
take
the
one
question
that
has
been
mentioned
here,
the
method
of
measurement
of
beneficial
consumptive
use.
that's
what
they're
talking
about.
how
are
you
going
to
measure
the
beneficial
consumptive
use?
now,
you've
got
--
you've
got
two
things
to
make.
in
this
case,
the
thing
that
they're
going
to
measure
is
the
consumptive
use
for
the
division
of
the
lower
basin
water
use
among
the
states
of
the
lower
basin.
the
upper
basin
states,
when
they
approach
the
--
the
conference
table
to
try
and
negotiate
a
settlement,
they
have
exactly
the
same
problem
as
the
lower
basin
has
now.
we
have
to
decide
how
to
--
how
to
measure
beneficial
consumptive
use.
we
have
to
determine
what
we
were
going
to
do
with
the
reservoir
losses
in
the
upper
basin.
we
have
to
decide
what
we
were
going
to
do
with
the
united
states
claims
and
--
and
there
as
here,
the
claims
of
all
the
states
far
exceeded
the
--
the
upper
basin's
share
of
the
waters
under
the
colorado
river
compact.
we
have
the
same
problems,
so
we
--
we
adopted
a
method
of
measurement
of
beneficial
consumptive
use
by
the
upper
basin
compact
for
the
division
of
the
upper
basin
water
among
the
upper
basin
states.
now,
we
don't
contend
that
that
is
binding
on
the
lower
basin.
they
can
use
any
method
of
measurement
they
wish
to
divide
their
lower
basin
water
use.
now,
again,
may
i
say,
the
time
may
come
where
it
can't
be
soon
because
under
any
theory
of
method
of
measurement
or
consumptive
use,
they
can't
say
that
2,500,000
out
of
7,500,000
use,
no
matter
how
you
measure
it,
but
at
some
time
in
the
future
when
the
upper
basin
approaches
its
full
utilization
of
its
7,500,000
acre-foot,
the
lower
basin
may
come
into
this
court
and
say,
“the
method
of
measurement
which
the
upper
basin
using
is
inaccurate.
and
therefore,
by
using
that
method
of
measurement,
they
are
depriving
us
of
certain
waters
which
we
are
entitled
to
under
the
compact.”
and
when
they
make
that
allegation,
we
are
going
to
have
to
stand
trial
if
--
if
we
think
that
we're
right.
if
we
are
using
an
inaccurate
method
of
measurement,
of
course,
we
won't
have
to
back
down
and
say,
“we
will
still
use
it
to
divide
the
water
use
among
the
upper
states,
but
so
far
as
interbasin
obligations
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
--
interbasin
obligations
are
concerned
between
one
basin
and
another,
we
will
have
to
use
the
method
which
this
court
shall
determine
is
an
accurate
method
and
that's
the
only
thing
that
is
in
question
here.
they
can
use
whatever
method
they
want
and
we
can
use
ours.
and
from
practical
experience,
if
the
court
please,
while
we're
on
that,
let
me
say
that
when
the
time
comes,
they're
--
they're
getting
down
to
measuring
the
last
few
drops
of
water,
but
i
doubt
if
there's
any
one
method
of
measurement
that
can
be
use
in
that
basin.
in
the
upper
basin,
we
have
over
8000,
gentlemen,
over
8000
separate
diversions
under
all
kinds
of
conditions,
little
vegetables
that
will
arrogate
a
few
acres,
big
vegetables
arrogate
a
lot
of
acres
in
basin
uses
out
of
basin
uses,
8000
and
i
defy
anyone
to
find
a
method
by
which
you
can
measure
diversions
less
returns
to
the
river.
so,
we
have
had
to
be
practical
about
it.
and
so,
we
have
adopted
what
we
call
the
mainstream
depletion.
we
measure
the
inflow
into
a
tributary
and
we
measure
the
outflow
from
that
tributary
and
the
engineers
by
computations
figure
out
the
consumptive
use.
now,
the
definition
of
consumptive
use
is
easy.
beneficial
consumptive
use
is
nothing
more
than
the
water
that
is
burned
up
by
the
activities
of
man,
but
when
you
come
to
measuring
it,
it
may
be
quite
a
job
and
may
depend
entirely
on
the
area
or
the
use
it's
made.
it's
easy
when
you
have
a
transbasin
diversion
as
california.
it's
easy
to
measure
it
because
you
just
measure
the
water
they
take
because
none
of
it
returns
to
the
river.
all
right,
let
me
now
--
now
mention
the
claims
of
the
united
states.
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
the
petition
of
the
united
states
is
confined
to
the
claims
of
the
use
of
water
in
the
lower
basin
of
the
river.
the
master
found
that
the
united
states
did
not
attempt
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
this
action
beyond
its
original
purpose
of
dividing
the
lower
basin
water
use.
the
petition
for
intervention
nowhere
asserts
any
claims
for
relief
against
the
upper
basin
or
the
upper
basin
states.
neither
did
the
united
states
move
for
a
joinder
of
the
upper
states
as
being
necessary
for
determination
of
the
united
states
claims,
and
--
and
i'll
be
frank.
if
the
united
states
have
joined,
have
moved
to
join
the
upper
states,
we
would
have
opposed
that
motion
the
same
as
we're
opposing
the
motion
for
--
of
california,
and
for
a
very
good
reason,
the
untied
states
cannot
play
that
the
upper
states
are
depriving
the
united
states
of
one
drop
of
water
use
to
which
they're
entitled
in
the
lower
basin,
and
we
would
oppose
it
for
another
good
reason.
we,
at
all
times,
have
acted
in
entire
good
faith
for
the
united
states
of
america.
in
the
upper
basin
compact,
we
included
a
provision
which
said
that
all
uses
of
the
united
states,
its
instrumentalities
and
its
words
which
included
the
ambiance
that
all
those
uses
in
the
upper
basin
are
to
be
charged
against
the
share
of
the
state
in
which
the
use
is
made.
the
united
states
can
use
the
entire
7,500,000
acre-foot
of
apportionment
that
the
upper
basin
has
and
it
will
not
affect
the
lower
basin
one
i
order,
because
it
will
be
charged
against
the
share
of
the
state
in
which
the
use
is
made.
and
so,
the
upper
--
the
lower
basin
is
now
faced
with
the
--
with
the
same
problem
of
what
to
do
with
this
united
states
claims.
but
why
should
we
be
embroiled
in
this
litigation
when
we
have
taken
care
of
the
united
states
in
the
upper
basin?
and
i
would
like
to
conclude,
your
honors,
just
for
this.
the
--
the
upper
basin,
as
i
said,
after
the
negotiation
of
the
compact,
knew
that
they
faced
this
problem
of
dividing
among
the
states
of
the
upper
basin
their
share
of
the
waters.
they
did
it
by
a
negotiation
around
the
compensate
which
--
and
by
an
interstate
compact,
which
i
understand
is
considered
preferable
than
to
fight
it
out
in
court.what
i
want
to
point
out,
it
was
not
an
easy
task.
as
i
mentioned
before,
the
claims,
the
total
claims
of
the
states
in
the
upper
basin
far
exceeded
the
7,500,000
acre
feet
that
we
have
to
divide.
we
also
knew
that
if
in
a
long
period
of
drought,
the
water
supply
of
the
river
went
down,
we
might
not
have
7,500,000
acre
feet
left
after
meeting
the
iii
(b)
commitment
to
deliver
75,000,000
in
each
10
years
of
lee's
ferry.
so,
they
divided
it
in
percentages,
but
it
was
--
it
was
a
tough
job
because
when
it
came
to
the
percentages,
every
state
realized
now
that
this
was
the
last
water
hold
that
they
had
to
go
on
from
now
and
forever
to
take
care
of
their
future
development
in
that
area
and
that
the
only
source
was
the
colorado
river
and
so
there
was
a
fight
by
each
of
these
states
for
as
high
percentages
possible.
but
they
--
they
did
give
and
take
colorado
for
example
that
furnishes
over
70%
of
the
supply
of
the
colorado
river
accepted
as
its
share
51.75%
of
the
upper
basin's
portion.
now,
that
was
--
colorado
thought
that
it
was
making
a
great
concession.
and
the
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
one
of
the
principle
factors
which
caused
these
states
to
reduce
their
claims
in
order
to
arrive
at
this
agreement
was
the
desire
to
avoid
litigation.
they
had
all
had
experience,
colorado
particularly,
and
as
i
said
before
it
hasn't
all
been
good.
and
--
and
they
wanted
to
avoid
litigation.
and
so,
that
was
one
of
the
prime
factors,
but
now,
we
are
told
by
the
proponents
that
having
gone
to
that
trouble,
the
upper
basin
compact
has
failed
as
--
of
its
purpose,
because
we
are
still
to
be
involved
in
the
litigation
in
dividing
the
lower
basin
water
use.
not
only
that,
but
we
are
told
that
if
in
the
division
of
the
lower
basin
water
use,
the
lower
basin
uses
certain
principles
or
methods
that
these
are
then
to
be
imposed
upon
the
upper
basin
in
the
absence
of
any
allegation
that
the
upper
basin
compact
is
depriving
the
lower
basin
of
any
water,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
we
are
not.
that
these
principles
and
methods
that
are
going
to
be
used
in
the
lower
basin
are
going
to
be
imposed
on
the
upper
basin
and
if
they
are
contradictory
to
any
provision
in
the
upper
basin
compact,
the
compact
is
to
be
thrown
out
the
window.
so,
why
did
we
negotiate
a
compact?
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
please
that
this
violates
our
sense
of
justice
somehow,
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
master's
report
should
be
accepted
and
this
motion
should
be
denied.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
i
--
i
speak
for
colorado,
wyoming,
utah,
and
new
mexico,
but
only
for
utah
and
new
mexico
in
their
upper
basin
capacity.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
in
the
lower
basin
capacities
where
there
have
been
made
parties,
they
do
not
wish
to
accept
to
the
master's
report
in
that
regard.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
until,
your
honor
i
will
--
i
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
until
the
lower
basin
said
that
by
the
use
of
our
system,
we
are
then
depriving
them
of
water
to
which
they're
entitled
in
the
lower
basin.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
unless
it
could
be
done
by
negotiation.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
in
our
brief,
we
took
each
--
each
eight
--
each
issue
in
the
lower
basin
dispute
and
showed
wherein
we
have
lack
of
interest.
i
might
just
one
mention
--
mention
one
other
thing
while
we're
about
it.
this
matter
of
--
of
surplus,
nobody
has
pointed
out
that
the
compact
says
that
there's
--
that
there
shall
not
be
a
further
division
of
the
surplus
till
1963,
and
if
california
stables
that
they
have
in
their
exceptions
are
correct,
i
don't
know
what
interest
we
have
in
surplus
because
by
their
own
figures,
we
--
the
most
that
we
can
use
in
the
upper
basin
of
our
7,500,000
is
only
6,200,000
acre
feet.
so,
what
interest
we
have
in
surplus
at
this
stage
of
the
game
when
our
use
is
only
2,500,000
acre
feet,
i
failed
to
understand.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
no,
your
honor,
but
i
have
considered
this
and
i
have
so
reported
to
my
employer
which
is
the
colorado
water
conservation
board,
which
is
the
official
state
agency
in
the
interstate
water
matters
in
colorado.
and
this
matter
came
up
i
pointed
out
to
you,
that
if
this
court
does
adopt
a
method
of
measurement
of
beneficial's
consumptive
use
for
division
of
lower
basin
waters
that
if
and
when
the
time
came
that
we
got
into
interbasin
litigation
as
to
what
method
should
be
used
to
measure
interbasin
rights
and
obligations,
we
might
be
faced,
not
with
res
judicata,
but
with
a
persuasive
effect
of
a
prior
decision
of
this
court
and
we
face
that
realistically
we
--
we
know
it.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
no,
it
may
--
it
may
take
different
methods
of
measurement.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
if
the
court
please,
i
look
at
this
way.
that
as
long
as
those
methods
if
they
are
accurate
in
other
words
you
can
measure
water
by
acre
feet
or
second
feet
or
minors
inches
and
so
on
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
--
and
you
always
get
the
same
result.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
but
there
can
be
an
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
mainstream
depletion
as
a
method
of
measurement
is
accurate
or
whatever
it
is.
there
can
also
be
an
argument
as
to
whether
diversions
less
returns
is
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
yes,
only
it's
more
difficult.
when
you're
measuring
consumptive
use,
it's
--
it's
a
lot
more
difficult
than
to
measure
out
2,800,000
acre
feet
of
water
under
a
contract
to
arizona
or
that
is
--
assuming
it
was
in
terms
of
diversions
rather
than
in
terms
of
beneficial
consumptive
use.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
you
bet
they
cannot,
no
sir.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
no,
the
only
thing
i
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
well
--
mr.

that's
right,
but
in
--
in
case
i
get
your
--
your
idea
correctly,
justice,
i
--
the
--
the
compact
i
think
is
a
firm
division
as
between
the
upper
basin
and
lower
basin.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
yes
--
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
it
was.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
they
--
they
can
come
in
collision,
there's
no
question.
my
point
is
that
until
the
upper
basin
approaches
its
full
utilization.
mr.
hatfield
chilson
that's
right.
thank
you.
