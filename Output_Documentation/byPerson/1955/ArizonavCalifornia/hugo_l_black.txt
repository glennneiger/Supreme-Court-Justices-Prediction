justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
about
--
the
effect
of
your
argument
has
challenged
that
they
litigate
the
compact
on
the
ground
that
is
a
count
to
apportion
more
water
than
they
limit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
would
be
the
result
if
they
have
attempted
it
during
your
argument
to
apportion
more
water
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
turned
out
that
in
that
way
and
there
has
to
be
a
strict
apportionment,
is
it
your
idea
that
you
couldn't
do
that
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
--
maybe
i
don't
--
maybe
i
completely
understood,
it
wouldn't
deprived
from
the
evidence.
as
i
gather
it,
you
have
a
compact
which
it
says,
seven
and
half
upper,
seven
and
a
half
lower,
the
--
with
some
unknown
excess.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
gather
it,
because
i
thought
that
you're
arguing
that
in
reality
there
are
so
many
claims
by
the
government
that
it's
impossible
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
being
true,
if
that
were
true,
would
that
be
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
compact
or
do
you
think
its
supposed
to
be
right
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
something
would
have
to
give
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
compact
itself
or
--
or
else
the
court
will
have
to
undertake
the
chance
of
revising
the
compact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
invoke
it.
in
the
plain
language
that
would
mean
deciding
how
much
each
of
the
states
should
have
rather
or
--
or
division,
instead
of
having
decided
by
the
compact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
but
what
i
--
what
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
is
as
i
see
it
(inaudible)
you're
to
make
these
states
a
party
because
the
compact
won't
work
as
it
is,
they
can't
divide
it
according
to
its
terms.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
the
compact
is
invalid,
therefore,
the
whole
thing
is
challenged
and
therefore,
all
of
the
states
have
to
be
a
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
won't
work,
the
compact
is
no
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying
that
whether
it's
to
be
set
aside
or
not,
if
it's
not
set
aside,
the
issues
that
are
raised
that
it
must
be
rewritten
for
the
reapportionment
of
the
water,
so
as
to
use
in
your
term,
to
see
whether
it's
burden
of
the
lost
flow,
meaning
the
burden
of
the
loss
being,
which
one
gets
left
in
it
provided
in
the
compact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
totally
fine,
unless
some
--
that
idea
i
have
is
regrettable.
i
do
not
require
you
make
them
--
the
claim
to
make
them
necessary
a
party
to
the
idea
(inaudible)
based
on
what
you
said
(inaudible)
it's
a
strong
argument
(inaudible)
for
this
--
for
this
reason.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
saying
that
on
the
circumstances
repeatedly
is
bound
to
develop
that
you've
got
to
provide
a
different
allotment
of
the
water,
the
seven
and
a
half
million
to
the
upper
and
seven
and
half
million
to
the
lower.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
--
and
if
the
salvaged
water
would
be
treated
differently,
you'd
have
several
different
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
all
get
down
to
the
argument
that
since
there
--
i
accept
this
as
it
might,
since
the
issues
raised
may
require
a
change
in
the
allotment
or
apportionment
of
water
in
the
compact,
maybe,
you
must
have
all
the
parties
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can't
do
that
even
by
the
laws
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
we
--
do
we
know
what
the
lower
basin
water
is
in
fixed
gallons?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
beneficial
is
used
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
that
the
definition
--
what
the
definition
of
beneficial
use
would
be
adopted
here.
it
wouldn't
also
aspire
to
the
upper
basin
statement
so
far
as
what
they
have
to
send
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
problem
especially
on
that
thing?
suppose
it
would
proceed
to
the
case,
arizona's
contention
should
be
different.
it
should
be
decreased
that
they
had
the
2,800,000
of
acre
which
california
(inaudible)
25
years
of
our
--
our
brief
has
suggested
or
other
(inaudible)
it
turned
out
that
the
upper
basin
would
not
get
it
and
said
it
could
not
keep
that
75
--
seven
and
a
half
million.
what
then
could
the
court
should
agree
here,
the
actual
binding
or
with
the
upper
division
as
to
the
(inaudible)
applied
to
the
seven
and
a
half
million.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
at
that
--
at
that
time,
let's
suppose
the
present,
that
arizona
had
found
the
use
for
all
the
water,
they
get
for
individual
use,
would
that
be
upset
if
the
situation
should
develop
whether
it
was
not
15,000,000
a
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
not
to
some
extent
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
distribution
this
might
lay
down?
the
--
it's
impossible
to
continue
for
both
states,
as
the
right
had
developed
and
matured
and
which
would
have
to
be
upset
by
reason
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
had
this
to
my
mind.
if
the
decree
which
is
rendered
as
decree
in
this
party
from
the
lower
basin
on
account
of
the
present,
undoubtedly,
a
present
existing
controversy
in
the
course
of
this
substance,
can
we
--
can
that
be
settled
here
now
as
between
then
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
not
later
have
to
be
upset
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
unless
it's
done
on
a
percentage
basis
rather
than
on
a
basis
--
basis
of
2,800,000
and
4,300,000
enclosed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
be
the
difference?
would
it
take
practical
speaking
instead
of
this
course
considering
on
the
basis
that
was
going
to
allow
2,800,000,
4,300,000
and
actually
wanted
to
--
it
took
the
percentage
instead
of
the
gallon
of
the
acre.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
i
was
asking
was,
if
we
are
going
to
deny
that,
what
would
be
the
practical
difference
from
the
states,
arizona,
california,
and
nevada?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
the
disadvantage
or
advantages
today
of
the
seven
and
a
half
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
it
if
the
growing
of
percentage
basis
that
could
never
follow
the
upper
basin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
your
contention
was
a
basis
for
adopting
that,
it
would
assume
that
that
would
be
the
(inaudible),
would
it
not
undercut
all
of
the
objections
as
made
by
california?
justice
hugo
l.
black
among
--
among
the
statement
of
the
lower
basin.
what
they
--
what
california
says
is
that
you
are
asking
for
a
certain
number
of
acre
feet.
they
say
that
can't
be
done,
can't
traditional
render
as
to
it.
because
of
a
chance,
there
will
not
be
15,000,000
acre
feet
or
16,000,000
acre
feet.
and
that's
where
they
say,
“you
are
asking
for
a
decree
which
may
affect
these
percentages,”
and
they
are
right
on
their
assumption.
but
if
your
--
if
the
case
was
treated
on
the
basis
of
a
percentage
division
between
the
states
that
are
now
having
controversy
among
themselves,
i
assume
their
diction
does
not
lie.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
get
it
back
the
percentages
or
by
figures?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
time
would
come
in
those
two
obligations
unfixed
upon
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
upper
basin
here
that
is
--
i
have
reasons
here
that
if
this
case
should
go
along
between
these
parties
and
a
7,500,000
acre
feet
is
pushing
among
these
numbers
of
the
lower
basin.
that
if
he
and
that
case
might
at
sometime
in
the
future
that
this
possible
conflict
arise
affect
the
upper
basin
tribe.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
no
idea
of
such
as
decree
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
the
division
between
these
parties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
is
no
petition
that
has
considered
what
you
say
it
did,
suppose
it
should
have
for
the
division
now
in
perpetuity
on
the
basis
that
--
that
the
southern
basin
--
that
the
southern
basin
must
get
seventy
five
hundred
or
seven
million
five
hundred
acre
feet
for
all
times
irrespective
how
much
the
northern
basin
have,
would
you
then
feel
that
(inaudible)
to
the
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
see
here
is
a
petition
which
doesn't
move
at
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
--
which
simply
ask
for
a
decree
divided
up
among
themselves
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
which
would
not
be
binding
on
you
in
anyway
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
he
used
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
even
he
would
yield
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
just
not
ask
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
impression.
justice
hugo
l.
black
2,500,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
do
you
speak
for
all
of
the
states
in
the
northern
basin?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
then
this
case
as
its
progresses,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
essentially
gave
the
definition,
your
viewpoints
that
you
would
still
be
free
to
use
any
--
use
--
you
take
space
in
the
upper
basin,
any
definition
you
desire
out
of
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
until
it
became
a
system
proposition
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
short,
your
position
is
that
if
that
you
have
decided
among
yourselves
that
was
in
your
right,
there
would
be
no
consideration
between
them,
that's
not
an
important
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
divide
it
if
you
can
take.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
if
they
given
up
the
reports,
they
can
decide
with
their
faith.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
later
on,
they
should
become
a
system
controversy
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
then
it
would
be
up
to
the
court
to
settle
the
meaning
of
the
term.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
satisfied,
all
that
you
have
satisfied
that
there's
nothing
in
and
no
--
and
in
no
way
the
suggestion
by
california
that
has
been
called
on
you
to
attend
of
to
affect
your
rights
and
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
you
were
made
a
party
and
the
court
did
define
the
consumptive
benefit,
the
beneficiary
consumptive
use
of
whatever
is
turned
in,
that
it
would
thereby
upset
you
if
you
were
a
party,
it
would
upset
your
plan
among
yourselves
and
in
your
division.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
contented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
and
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
court
(inaudible)
a
controversy
between
the
exemption
of
that
(inaudible).
suppose
that
we
were
to
render
it
either
upon
percentage
basis
or
on
the
figures,
figure
basis
that
(inaudible)
composed
other
than
the
difference
subject
to
change,
conditions
in
the
future,
with
reference
to
the
(inaudible)
of
preservation.
why
would
it
be
necessary
then
to
have
this
--
this
project?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
possible
to
get
it
on
anything
except
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
had
been
appropriated
in
the
northern
basin
already?
how
much
according
to
the
allocations
by
this
compact
had
left
upon
(inaudible)
justice

was
that
governor
johnson's
statement
of
what
he
thought
colorado
is
entitled
to?
[laughs]
justice

black
it
hasn't
been
done.
i
mean,
hostility
has
been
done.
it
has
not
been
fulfilled,
divided
in
perpetuity,
it's
on
the
border.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
basin
--
justice
hugo

black
i
don't
know
quite
the
sentence
in
perpetuity
in
division
in
the
northern
basin,
whatever
it
maybe
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
i
suppose
75,000,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
it
would
be
defeated
by
a
shortage
--
justice
hugo

black
--
of
the

of
the
basic
fund.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
it
--
if
there
is
a
controversy
between
the
dams
as
now
as
(inaudible)
how
can
it
be
done
under
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
divide
it
among
your
parties
on
the
basis
of
this.
now,
you
did
on
this
--
justice

black
--
you
could
not
(inaudible)
and
i
don't
suppose
(inaudible)
divide
it
all
if
it
was
(inaudible)
under
the
basis
if
we
know
what
excess
we
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
suppose
that
that's
spread
over
that
--
usually,
they
always
use
the
same
statement
as
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
california
be
heard
of
these
people
of
arizona
(inaudible)
or
is
arizona's
claim
to
get
any
of
the
water
already
in
use.
justice
hugo

and
is
that
the
basis
of
the
controversy
now?
justice

what
is
it
about?
justice

black
all

you
are

how
much

in

justice

black
well,
did
you
--
you
used
how
much
lately?
justice

how
do
they
say
you're
entitled
to
have?
justice
hugo

3,800,000.
justice

black
and
advice
them
all
the
legal
arguments,
would
you
find
(inaudible)
how
you
can
be
very
effective
on
that
by
stating
to
have
legal
thing.
justice

why
do
they
keep
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
to
be
action
if
they
ever
acquired
this
(inaudible)
but
why?
does
it
have
to
be
granted
as
in
fact,
of
that
factor?
justice

how
would
california
be
heard

not
having
this
people
in
a
practical
decree.
justice

black
what
other
decree?
justice

black
then
the
practical
reason
where
you

much
for

mexico
is
here.
justice

what
