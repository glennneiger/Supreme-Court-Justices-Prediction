mr.
northcutt
ely
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
accompanied,
your
honor,
by
attorney
general
brown
of
california,
who
has
kindly
yielded
his
time
so
that
our
time
may
not
be
divided.
this
is
a
suit
which
was
brought
by
the
state
of
arizona
against
the
state
of
california
and
seven
public
agencies
of
our
state
to
a
quiet
title
to
specific
quantities
of
water
from
the
colorado
river
system
for
declaratory
relief
and
for
an
injunction.
we
are
here
upon
exceptions
to
a
report
of
a
special
master
upon
california’s
motion
to
join
the
remaining
four
states
of
the
colorado
river
basin,
wyoming,
colorado,
new
mexico
and
utah,
nevada
and
the
united
states
having
intervened
in
this
case.
there
are
two
groups
of
issues
in
the
case,
one
relating
to
the
claims
of
the
states,
the
other
relating
to
the
claims
of
the
united
states.
i
may
say
that
this
is
the
fourth
suit
brought
in
this
court
by
arizona
relating
to
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river.it
is
the
first
in
which
he
has
not
joined
all
of
the
other
six
states.
the
first
action
in
1931
was
to
set
aside
or
declare
void
the
colorado
river
compact
and
to
declare
invalid
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
a
second
suit
in
1934
was
to
perpetuate
testimony
of
the
negotiators
of
the
compact
to
prove
certain
contentions
of
arizona
as
to
interpretation.
and
the
third
suit
in
1935
was
to
ignore
the
compact
and
for
equitable
apportionment.
this
is
not
an
equitable
apportionment
suit
in
which
a
state
asked
the
court
to
determine
for
it
the
quantity
of
water
of
an
interstate
stream
theretofore
undetermined
as
was
the
case
in
wyoming
versus
colorado,
or
kansas
versus
colorado,
or
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
or
even
in
the
last
colorado
river
suit.
here,
arizona
asked
a
court
to
quiet
title
in
perpetuity
to
quantities
of
water
which
she
says
have
already
been
fixed
and
determined
by
the
colorado
river
compact
and
the
boulder
canyon
project
act,
which
she
already
owns,
that
these
quantities
were
fixed
for
the
three
states
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada
by
the
colorado
river
compact
and
that
her
share
was
carved
out
by
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
and
contracts
made
thereunder.
now,
i
may
say
at
the
beginning
that
we
think
that
arizona
overstates
the
collective
rights
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada
against
the
upper
states
of
colorado,
new
mexico,
utah
and
wyoming
under
the
colorado
river
compact
to
the
extent
of
about
a
million
and
half
acre-feet
per
year.
and
if
that
is
true,
a
decree
based
upon
such
an
assumption
would
be
futile,
an
advisory
opinion
and
based
upon
a
fallacy
at
that,
unless
the
four
upper
states
whose
obligation
is
involved
here
and
who
must
furnish
80%
of
the
water
or
thereabouts
involved
in
this
suit
are
joined
and
bound
by
the
adjudication.
now,
second,
as
to
the
claims
of
the
united
states,
when
the
government
intervened
here,
it
claimed
a
total
of
approximately
12
million
acre-feet
of
water
for
various
purposes
which
is
about
half
again
as
large
as
the
combined
claims
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada.
these
are
for
federal
purposes.
and
in
addition
thereto,
claimed
an
unspecified
quantities,
the
right
for
the
complete
control
of
the
river,
the
utilization
of
a
full
capacity
of
all
of
its
reservoirs,
aggregating
some
28
million
acre-feet
for
flood
control
navigation,
treaty
requirements
and
other
federal
purposes.
we
say
that
on
the
phase
of
the
government’s
petition,
these
federal
claims
are
claims
against
the
waters
of
the
entire
system
and
not
claims
against
arizona,
california
and
nevada,
and
that
they
may
not
be
adjudicated
in
the
absence
of
all
seven
states.
we
accordingly
move
to
join
the
four
upper
states.
that
motion
was
referred
to
a
special
master.
he
filed
a
report,
recommending
adversely
that
our
motion
be
denied
except
with
respect
to
the
states
of
new
mexico
and
utah
in
their
limited
capacity
with
respect
to
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin
which
i’ll
explain
in
a
moment.
he
found
that
the
colorado
river
compact,
which
i’ll
shortly
describe,
so
insulated
the
interest
of
the
four
upper
states
from
the
interest
of
the
three
lower
states
that
these
controversy,
now
before
the
court,
with
respect
to
arizona,
california,
nevada
and
united
states,
although
justiciable
as
to
the
present
parties
is
not
justiciable
as
to
the
absent
parties
in
consequence
of
this
insulation
established
by
the
compact.
we
maintained
to
the
contrary
that
in
the
classic
language
from
shields
versus
barrow,
which
has
been
the
laws
since
1855,
that
the
absent
states,
not
only
have
an
interest
in
the
controversy,
but
an
interest
of
such
a
nature
that
a
final
decree
with
respect
to
the
parties
now
before
the
court
cannot
be
made
without
either
affecting
that
interest,
or
leaving
a
controversy
in
such
a
condition
that
its
final
termination
may
be
wholly
inconsistent
with
equity
and
good
conscience
in
the
language
of
the
court
and
that
they
should
be
joined
as
necessary
parties.
i
will
deal
with
a
question
of
justiciability
as
i
describe
the
elements
of
the
controversy
now
before
the
court.
first,
with
the
respect
to
the
issues
arising
from
the
colorado
river
compact,
next,
with
respect
to
those
arising
from
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
as
the
effect
of
claims
of
the
states,
and
finally,
the
independent
claims
of
the
united
states
as
they
affect
all
seven
states
in
our
view.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
it
has
intervened.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
has
not
asked
for
time
at
this
argument.
we
are
arguing
in
the
dark
to
some
degree
as
to
the
effect
to
the
government’s
claim.
we
take
one
view
of
the
phase
of
the
petition
and
what
it
means.
we
ask
before
the
master
that
the
united
states
be
called
upon
then
and
there
to
state
whether
his
claims
are
against
the
waters
of
the
entire
system
as
we
think
they
clearly
must
be
for
reasons
i'll
explain.
the
special
master
declined
the
call
upon
the
united
states
for
clarification.
he
said
he
was
going
to
obtain
it
but
in
a
formal
way
later.
judge
hayden
died
as
you
know.
so
far
as
i
know
without
obtaining
from
the
department
of
justice
such
a
clarification
and
we
do
not
have
here
any
formal
statement
from
the
department
of
justice
except
--
except
a
motion
filed
in
this
court
for
a
determination
by
the
court
of
what
they
call
certain
legal
issues
arising
from
the
master's
report
and
which
the
court
overruled
at
the
time
that
it
granted
oral
--
the
present
oral
hearing.
this
is
essentially
a
suit
on
contract.
as
i
said,
it
is
not
like
the
equitable
apportionment
cases
with
which
you're
familiar
heretofore.
there's
a
contract
here
between
essentially
the
four
upper
states
and
the
three
lower
states.
it's
a
suit
on
the
contract,
another
contract
which
is
evidence
by
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
and
a
limitation
act
which
the
project
act
required
the
legislature
of
california
to
enact
if
the
project
act
should
become
effective
in
1929
without
the
ratification
by
arizona
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
now,
let
me
explain.
the
compact
was
signed
in
1922
by
the
representatives
of
the
seven
states.
it
was
ratified
promptly
in
january
or
shortly
thereafter
in
1923
by
six
legislatures.
arizona's
legislature
rejected
it,
in
both
houses.
in
1925,
the
legislature
of
colorado
proposed
reciprocal
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
they
acted
upon
it
and
voted
it
down
in
both
house
as
the
journal
of
the
legislatures
bears
on
--
will
show
for
1923.
in
so
doing,
the
reservations
were
offered,
voted
upon
which
would
have
the
effect
of
excluding
the
gila
river
from
the
compact,
i'll
come
to
that
point
in
a
moment.
but
even
with
those
reservations,
the
compact
was
voted
down
in
both
houses.
the
state
of
--
the
legislature
of
colorado
in
1925,
to
overcome
this
stalemate
proposed
reciprocal
legislation,
which
would
make
the
compact
effective
as
six-state
document
waiving
ratification
by
the
seventh.
and
such
legislation
was
enacted
by
the
six
states
in
the
period
1925
to
1929.
when
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
came
before
congress
for
the
fourth
time
to
suing
johnsonville,
in
1928,
to
authorize
the
construction
of
what
is
now
known
as
hoover
dam
and
the
all-american
canal.
the
senators
of
the
upper
basin
states
insisted
that
there
be
incorporated
in
it,
a
provision
that
if
six
states
only
should
ratify,
then
in
that
event,
the
state
of
california
should
enact
this
limitation
act,
limiting
her
right
in
the
colorado
river,
so
that,
as
they
put
it,
if
arizona
stayed
out,
and
california
took
all
of
the
water
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
by
the
compact,
arizona
in
that
event
might
appropriate
free
of
the
compact
in
the
upper
basin
with
all
the
water
twice.
limitation
act
was
imposed
upon
us
or
the
protection
of
the
upper
states.
that
act
was
enacted
by
california.
the
project
act
provided
that
at
the
end
of
six
months,
the
president
of
the
united
states
should
proclaim
either
one
alternative
or
the
other
to
have
been
accomplished
either
seven-state
ratification
or
six-state
ratification
plus
the
limitation
act.
and
in
that
event
and
that
event
only,
should
the
project
act
go
into
effect.
now,
we
say
that
the
limitation
act
limiting
our
rights
which
came
into
existence
as
a
compliment
of
a
six
state
compact
and
in
consequence
of
arizona's
rejection
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
and
the
seven-states
compact
are
mutually
exclusive
covenants.
the
limitation
act
was
required
of
us
if
there
were
six-state
compact,
it
was
not
required
if
there
was
seven-state
compact.
arizona
here
sues
upon
both.
she
says
that
she
ratified
the
colorado
river
compact
in
1944,
15
years
after
the
expiration
of
the
six
months
period
to
which
i
referred
but
that
--
she
not
only
as
a
party
to
the
seven-state
compact
but
that
she
may
hold
california
to
the
limitations
upon
us
imposed
by
the
limitation
act.
now
the
limitation
act
provides
in
terms
as
to
the
project
act
that
this
agreement
between
california
and
the
united
states
was
for
the
expressed
benefit
of
arizona,
colorado,
nevada,
new
mexico,
utah
and
wyoming.
and
consequently,
we
say
that
we
are
liable
upon
one
or
the
other
of
these
agreements,
not
both
but
that
the
four
states
of
the
upper
division
are
necessary
parties
here
to
the
determination
of
which
shall
control.
they
are
the
expressed
joint
beneficiaries
of
the
limitation
act
if
arizona
sues
upon
it,
they
must
be
joined.
they
are
the
parties
to
the
seven-state
colorado
river
compact
which
if
it
exists
at
all,
replace
the
limitation
act.
now,
the
reason
why
the
colorado
river
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon,
sir?
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
question
--
we
--
we
say
at
our
pleadings
that
arizona
did
not
effectively
ratify
it.
we
say
that
for
several
reasons,
first,
to
the
exploration
of
the
15-year
period.
second,
the
fact
that
there
has
never
been
a
presidential
proclamation
of
a
seven-state
compact.
there
was
a
proclamation
in
29
that
seven
states
had
failed
to
ratify,
six
states
had,
and
for
other
reasons
but
the
primary
one
is
it
by
the
time
arizona
ratified
or
purported
to
in
1944
should
already
brought
to
this
court
three
times.
the
colorado
river
compact
in
one
form
or
another
had
laid
before
the
court
interpretations
of
it
which
in
the
first
case,
in
1931,
happened
to
coincide
almost
precisely
with
our
own
and
said
for
that
reason
she
wanted
no
part
of
it
and
rejected
it.
and
that
consequently,
the
california
projects,
which
i'll
mention
in
a
moment,
had
gone
ahead
with
expenditures
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars,
literally.
in
the
development
of
their
works
based
upon
water
rights
as
set
forth
in
the
compact,
as
everyone
understood
it,
when
--
when
arizona
ratified
if
she
did
it
all
in
1944,
she
did
so
with
announced
interpretations
that
they
are
the
diametric
reverse
of
that
and
which
she
attempts
to
establish
in
his
suit.
but
we
say
that
if
the
compact
did
become
a
seven-state
compact
in
1944,
then
as
to
arizona.
our
obligations
upon
the
limitation
act
are
ended
but
she
is
one
of
six
joint
beneficiaries
and
we
cannot,
we
think,
proceed
safely
without
the
presence
of
the
four
upper
states
as
other
joint
beneficiaries
to
be
bound
by
that
decree.
now,
the
compact
itself,
which
i'll
--
these
terms
i'll
come
shortly,
was
--
came
into
existence
in
this
way
in
1922.
the
colorado
river
arises
in
the
--
the
colorado,
extends
for
some
1700
miles
through
the
straits
of
colorado,
utah,
arizona,
the
long
arizona,
nevada
border,
the
arizona-california
border,
and
finally,
into
the
gulf
of
california.
in
its
lower
regions
and
in
the
--
just
before
leaving
the
united
states,
it
travels
along
the
realm
of
the
imperial
valley,
an
area
of
the
center
is
below
sea
level,
270
feet.
this
valley
was
an
imminent
and
continually
endanger
of
destruction
by
floods.
the
river
broke
in
1905
and
was
shutoff
with
great
difficulty
in
1907.
there
was
urgent
and
growing
need
for
a
flood
control
dam
upon
the
lower
river.
that
was
objected
to
by
the
upper
states
because
of
their
fear
that
the
doctrine
of
priority
of
appropriation,
irrespective
of
stateline
which
was
proclaimed
by
this
court
in
wyoming
versus
colorado
while
the
compact
was
being
negotiated.
we
had
it
make
it
possible
for
the
lower
states
to
appropriate
all
of
the
stored
flood
waters
as
they
have
therefore
--
theretofore
appropriated
all
of
the
natural
flow
and
expand
their
uses
to
such
a
degree
that
the
junior
appropriations
in
the
upper
basin
might
never
expand.
they
wanted
a
reservation,
a
protection
against
the
law
priority
of
appropriation
before
this
dam
should
be
authorized,
and
that
was
obtained
in
the
colorado
river
compact.
now,
the
compact,
as
signed
in
1922
provides
this.
it
divides
the
--
defines
first
the
colorado
river
system
as
being
a
colorado
river
and
its
tributaries
within
the
united
states.
and
the
most
significant
tributary
with
respect
to
this
lawsuit
is
the
gila,
which
arises
in
new
mexico,
traverses
arizona
and
empties
into
the
mainstream
near
yuma.
the
--
it
divides
the
basin
geographically
into
an
upper
basin
and
a
lower
basin
with
a
division
line
passing
through
lee
ferry,
a
point
in
northwestern
arizona.
and
it
divides
the
states
into
two
groups,
an
upper
division
and
a
lower
division.
the
upper
division
comprising
the
four
states
we
seek
to
join
here.
and
as
in
that
shows
the
basins
and
the
divisions
do
not
coincide.
there's
a
reason
for
that
which
i'll
explain
in
a
moment.
the
compact
does
not
purport
to
impose
obligations
upon
or
give
rights
to
any
individual
state.
what
it
does
do,
in
article
iii
(a),
is
to
apportioned
in
perpetuity
to
the
upper
basin
and
to
the
lower
basin
respectively.
the
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
per
year
in
perpetuity,
which
it
declare
shall
include
all
water
necessary
to
supply
any
rights
which
may
now
exist.
it
is
an
apportionment
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system.
article
iii
(b)
gives
the
lower
basin
the
right
to
increase
its
use
by
one
million
acre-feet
per
year.
now,
those
two
articles
together
dispose
of
the
consumptive
use
of
16
million
acres-feet
per
year.
but
the
compact
recognizes
that
this
is
not
all
the
water.
at
the
time
of
its
negotiation,
it
was
thought
that
there
was
perhaps
four
of
five
million
acre-feet
more.
we
know
from
later
water
records
that
the
quantity
and
excess
of
the
16
million
is
less
than
that.
article
iii
(c)
directs
that
if
the
united
states
shall
make
a
treaty
with
mexico,
the
mexican
water
shall
be
supplied
if
possible
out
of
this
surplus
above
the
16
million
acre-feet
fixed
by
article
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b).
if
that
surplus
is
deficient,
the
two
basins
will
each
yield
half
the
deficiency.
in
articles
iii
(f)
and
iii
(g)
provide
for
conferences
after
40
years,
that
is
after
october
1,
1963,
to
apportion
this
surplus
above
the
requirements
of
iii
(a),
iii
(b)
and
iii
(c).
now,
those
provisions
all
deal
with
the
consumptive
use
of
water.
there
is
an
addition,
a
provision,
article
iii
(d)
that
provides
that
the
four
states
of
the
upper
division,
colorado,
new
mexico,
utah
and
wyoming,
will
not
deplete
the
flow
of
the
river
at
lee
ferry
below
an
aggregate
of
75
million
acre-feet
in
each
period
of
10
consecutive
years.
and
article
iii
(c),
to
which
i
referred,
adds
that
the
upper
division
will
increase
that
delivery
if
necessary
to
supply
one-half
of
the
deficiency
of
mexico.
now,
that
provision
deals
with
a
corpus.
it
is
a
block,
an
aggregate
of
wet
water
to
be
placed
in
the
river
or
allowed
to
flow
at
lee
ferry.
it
is
not
an
apportionment
of
consumptive
use,
75
million
acre-feet
delivered
at
lee
ferry
and
used
along
the
stream
will
not
support
consumptive
uses
of
75
million
acre-feet
in
10
years
because
upon
any
theory,
the
return
flow,
which
goes
into
mexico,
is
not
a
part
of
the
consumptive
use
in
the
lower
basin.
and
i
emphasize
because
i'll
return
to
it
with
a
distinction
between
consumptive
use,
which
is
what
is
apportioned
by
the
compact
and
corpus,
the
guarantee
of
wet
water
at
lee
ferry.
there
are
two
--
there
a
number
of
questions
in
--
of
compact
interpretation,
which
are
at
issue,
here
in
the
brief
but
i
shall
select
two
of
them
because
they're
controlling
in
my
view.
the
first
is,
what
is
beneficial
consumptive
use
and
second,
whether
the
seven
and
a
half
million
which
is
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
per
annum
is
the
water,
simply,
of
the
mainstream,
or
whether
it
includes
the
waters
of
the
tributaries,
particularly
the
gila.
now,
the
first
question
as
to
what
is
beneficial
consumptive
use
arises
in
this
way,
arizona
asked
a
declaration
from
the
court
that
this
expression,
which
appears
only
in
articles
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b),
fixing
the
rights
between
basins
shall
be
defined.
and
the
definition
she
wants
is
that
this
means
the
man-made
depletion
of
the
virgin
flow
of
the
mainstream,
everyone
agrees
that
consumptive
use
doesn't
mean
the
amount
diverted,
it's
less
than
that.
california
says
that
the
term
has
the
same
meaning
in
the
colorado
river
compact
as
it
is
defined
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
and
in
the
mexican
water
treaty
and
as
this
court
defined
it
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming.
it's
defined
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
as
diversions
less
returns
to
the
river.
now,
the
difference
between
the
two
methods
of
--
the
two
definitions
are
simply
this,
on
arizona's
definition,
there
would
be
no
accounting,
no
liability
no
charge
for
the
use
of
so-called
salvaged
water.
that
is
water
which
went
to
the
sea
in
the
state
of
nature
or
was
burned
up
by
evaporation
losses
or
seeped
into
the
sands
but
which
has
been
salvaged
by
the
activities
of
man
in
reclamation
projects
and
dams
and
put
to
use.
and
if
that
water
may
be
used
by
the
lower
basin
in
addition
to
the
seven
and
a
half
million
apportion
of
article
iii
(a)
and
in
addition
to
the
million
acre-feet
of
additional
use
permitted
by
article
iii
(b).
there
is
about
a
million
and
a
half-acre
feet
of
uses
of
waters
of
that
category,
so-called
salvaged
water.
arizona
alleges
that
the
difference
between
the
two
methods,
the
two
definitions
on
the
gila
alone
amounts
to
about
1
million
acre-feet
and
there
is
about
a
half
a
million
additional
upon
the
mainstream.
now,
the
question
therefore
is
whether
the
lower
basin
may
use
all
together
eight
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
including
salvaged
water
or
eight
and
a
half,
plus
one
and
half
or
10
million
acre-feet.
now,
the
question
affects
the
upper
basin
in
this
way.
if
the
lower
basin
is
entitled
to
use
the
so-called
salvaged
water,
the
million
and
a
half
acre-feet,
without
any
accounting
for
it
under
articles
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b),
it,
of
course,
diminishes
to
that
extent
the
surplus
above
the
16
million
covered
by
those
two
articles,
it
is
an
invasion,
a
use
of
the
surplus.
a
surplus
is
an
undivided
common
fund
in
which
all
seven
states
have
undivided
interests.
it
is
a
buffer
or
cushion
which
protects
the
lower
basin
and
the
upper
basin
from
the
obligation
to
mexico.
the
mexican
water
shall
come
out
of
it
first.
and
it
protects
the
upper
division
from
their
obligation
under
article
iii
(c)
to
increase
their
deliveries
above
75
million
acre-feet
in
10
years.
to
the
extent,
the
surplus
is
diminished,
all
seven
states
are
affected.
and
at

our
brief

project
and
which

the
arizona
theories.

and

revised

reducing
the
quantity
of

to
that
shown
--
for
the
critical
quarter
century
of
1930
to
1954
which
is
13,650,000
acre-feet.
now,
if
arizona's
theories
apply
so
that
there
is
no
charge
for
the
use
of
salvaged
water,
the
end
result,
as
shown
in
the
last
line
on
that
table,
is
that
there
is
a
deficit
in
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
colorado
river
compact
plus
the
treaty
with
mexico.
and
that
burden
must
fall
either
upon
a
reduction
in
the
use
in
the
upper
basin
of
the
seven
million
and
half
acre-feet
apportioned
to
them
if
they
make
good
upon
their
75
million
acre-feet
guarantee
or
if
they
don't
make
good
on
that
guarantee,
then
upon,
we
reflected
in
a
diminution
of
uses
in
the
lower
basin.
the
upper
basin
is
consequently
affected
by
the
definition
of
the
term
beneficial
of
consumptive
use,
not
only
as
applied
in
the
upper
basin
to
measure
their
rights
but
as
applied
in
the
lower
basin
to
measure
our
rights.
and
as
we
say,
the
arizona
complaint
is
framed
upon
the
theory
that
there
is
available
to
the
lower
basin
under
the
compact
an
aggregate
of
some
million
and
half
acre-feet
more.
then
we
think
is
there
under
the
meaning
of
beneficial
consumptive
use
which
was
the
one
contemporarily
accepted
and
reported
by
the
compact
negotiators
and
was
submitted
by
arizona
to
this
court
in
1931.
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
lee
ferry
is
the
dividing
line
between
the
two
basins
fixed
by
the
compact.
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
obligation
under
article
iii
(d)
is
to
be
measured
at
lee
ferry
and
meters
are
installed
there
for
that
purpose.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
that
is
the
--
the
great
--
the
gap
in
this
case.
there
is
no
way
to
interpolate
or
translate
the
one
method
into
the
other.
it
rises
there
in
this
way
to
take
the
gila
river
as
an
example,
some
2,400,000
acre-feet
flow
in
measured
streams
in
the
gila
area.
that
water
is
converted,
burned
up,
used
in
arizona
to
grow
crops
and
support
cities.
in
the
state
of
nature
of
that
same
flow,
reaching
the
mainstream
would
have
been
diminished
by
the
long
sandy
stretches
of
the
gila
arizona
says
by
at
least
one
million
acre-feet.
that
is
the
matter
of
conjecture.
nobody
was
there
to
measure
it
before
the
white
man
came.
but
assuming
that
that
is
the
case,
then
the
difference
between
the
two
theories
is
this,
shall
the
uses
upon
the
gila
be
measured
only
in
the
amount
they
diminished
the
flow
at
the
mainstream
or
shall
they
be
measure
in
the
quantities
of
water
actually
consumed.
we
are
required
in
california
by
the
expressed
terms
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
to
measure
our
uses
as
diversions
less
returns
to
the
river.
it
makes
no
difference
what
in
the
state
of
nature
might
have
reach
the
mexican
border.
we
are
charged
with
diversions
less
returns
to
the
river,
the
more
rigorous
of
these
two
methods.
the
mexican
water
treaty
provides
for
a
reduction
in
the
deliveries
of
a
million
and
half
acre-feet
guarantee
to
mexico
in
the
proportion
that
the
consumptive
uses
in
the
united
states
are
diminished.
and
the
treaty
defines
consumptive
use
just
as
we
defined
it
and
as
the
court
did
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming.
the
substitution
of
the
depletion
theory
for
the
actual
consumptive
use
measurement,
what
as
i
say,
result
in
a
difference
of
a
million
and
half
acre-feet.
now,
the
second
question
here
is
whether
the
compact
apportions
to
the
lower
basin
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
from
the
mainstream
or
apportions
that
quantity
from
the
colorado
river
system
including
the
tributaries.
that
was
the
specific
issue
upon
which
arizona's
legislature
rejected
the
compact
in
1923,
and
upon
which
arizona
brought
suit
in
this
court
in
1931
to
set
the
compact
aside.
article
ii
(a)
defines
the
colorado
river
system
as
including
the
tributaries
as
well
as
the
mainstream
and
article
iii
(a)
apportions
the
waters
of
the
system,
and
it
directs
that
there
shall
be
included
in
this
apportionment
all
rights
then
existing.
now,
the
rights
on
the
gila
are
the
oldest
that
arizona
has.
they've
been
in
--
in
existence
since
1870
with
their
bounds.
now,
if
the
uses
on
the
gila
are
two
million
acre-feet,
as
we
say
they
are,
and
if
the
lower
basin
has
apportions
of
seven
and
half
million
acre-feet
of
consumptive
use,
then
we
have
left,
out
at
the
mainstream
in
the
lower
basin,
for
division
in
this
decree,
approximately
five
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
under
article
iii
(a).
if
arizona's
method
of
measuring
consumptive
use
were
sustained
and
the
uses
on
the
gila
were
valued
at
only
about
one
million
acre-feet,
then
they
may
be
divided
by
the
decree
in
this
case
on
the
mainstream
under
article
iii
(a),
apportioned
in
perpetuity,
only
six
and
half
million
acre-feet.
but
arizona
here
seeks
to
quiet
title
in
the
lower
basin
to
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
of
water
from
the
mainstream
and
she
must
do
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
figure
that
she
wishes
quieted
in
herself.
let
me
explain.
she
claims
from
the
mainstream
the
specific
figure
of
2,800,000
acre-feet
under
article
iii
(a),
apportioned
in
perpetuity.
the
compact
doesn't
make
that
apportionment
to
her.
it
makes
no
apportionment
to
any
state
individually.
but
she
says
that
the
rights
of
california
were
fixed
by
the
limitation
act
in
--
in
iii
(a)
water
at
4,400,000
acre-feet
per
annum,
which
they
were.
and
the
300,000
acre-feet
is
a
fair
allocation
to
nevada
and
what
is
left
after
deducting
4,400,000
for
california
and
300,000
for
nevada
from
seven
and
a
half
million
in
the
mainstream
is
2,800,000
acre-feet
for
herself
of
waters
apportioned
by
article
iii
(a).
and
she
says
she
holds
a
contract
with
the
secretary
of
interior
made
in
1944
which
she
does,
which
authorizes
the
delivery
in
arizona
from
the
mainstream
of
2,800,000
acre-feet.
now,
that
contract,
which
she
pleads,
is
the
next
as
one
of
her
exhibits,
recites
on
its
face
that
it
does
not
declare
what
part
of
the
2,800,000
acre
feet
covered
by
that
agreement
is
apportion
of
article
iii
(a),
how
much
is
covered
of
article
iii
(b)
nor
how
much
the
surplus.
but
arizona
says
that
her
right
to
the
waters
apportioned
and
perpetuity
from
the
mainstream
of
article
iii
(a)
is
2,800,000
acre-feet.
and
she
arrives
with
that
only
upon
the
assumption
that
the
lower
basin
may
claim
from
the
mainstream,
seven
and
half
million
acre-feet,
without
deduction
for
any
uses
upon
the
tributaries.
now,
she
gets
rid
the
gila
river
by
identifying
it
with
article
iii
(b),
which
says
that
the
lower
basin
may
increase
its
uses
by
one
million
acre-feet
per
year.
and
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
uses
on
the
gila
are
the
oldest
she
has,
she
identifies
him
with
his
increment
of
additional
new
uses
permitted
by
article
iii
(b).
and
the
reason
she
says
is
that
the
negotiators
of
the
seven
states
of
sta.
fe,
in
1922
agreed
that
arizona
should
have
that
million
acre-feet
and
that
it
should
be
identified
with
the
gila
river.
now,
that
is
a
testimony
which
she
wanted
to
perpetuate
in
their
suit
here
in
1934,
the
testimony
of
the
negotiators,
and
the
court
rejected
it,
telling
it
would
never
become
admissible,
that
it
was
in
flat
contradiction
of
the
terms
of
the
compact
among
other
reasons.
nevertheless,
she
annexes
to
her
pleadings
here,
the
ex
parte
statements
of
one
of
her
negotiators
and
of
others
to
--
to
identify,
make
that
same
identification
of
the
gila
with
article
iii
(b).
now,
what
this
all
comes
to
is
this,
arizona
says
that
the
seven
and
half
million
apportion
of
article
iii
(a)
is
identical
with
the
75
million
acre-feet
guaranteed
by
the
states
of
the
upper
division
at
lee
ferry
each
decade,
that
one
is
simply
10
times
the
other.
now,
there
are
many
reason
why
that
cannot
be
so,
either
physically
or
legally,
and
they
were
spelled
out
for
the
court
clearly
by
mr.
dean
acheson,
then
counsel
for
arizona
in
the
1931
case
in
which
he
showed,
i
think,
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
of
the
states,
that
the
75
million
acre-feet
guaranteed
at
lee
ferry
includes
two
components,
the
water
required
to
sustain
the
uses
on
the
mainstream
in
the
united
states
below
lee
ferry
and
water
from
mexico.
whereas
the
seven
and
half
million
apportioned
by
article
iii
(a)
in
perpetuity
of
consumptive
use
includes
two
components,
but
not
the
same
two,
uses
on
the
mainstream
plus
the
uses
on
the
gila
and
the
tributaries.
in
other
words,
the
75
million
acre-feet
includes
some
water
from
mexico.
now,
heretofore,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
states
of
the
upper
division
have
not
yielded
from
their
position
that
if
they
deliver
75
million
acre-feet
in
every
decade
at
lee
ferry,
they're
entitled
to
credit
for
some
deliveries
to
mexico.
the
effect
of
arizona's
contention,
if
the
decree
were
issued
as
she
wishes
it,
would
be
the
quiet
title
in
perpetuity
to
--
in
favor
of
the
lower
basin
to
all
of
that
75
million
acre-feet
guaranteed
by
iii
(d)
as
though
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
and
containing
no
water
available
for
delivery
to
mexico.
now,
consequently
the
four
upper
states
are
surely
affected
by
the
issue
of
whether
they
must
deliver
at
lee
ferry
every
decade,
75
million
acre-feet,
including
the
water
from
mexico,
or
75
million
plus
water
from
mexico.
the
claim
of
arizona
that
all
are
2,800,000
acre-feet
can
be
taken
from
the
mainstream
as
absolutely
central
to
her
case.
she
says
she
must
quiet
title
to
that
quantity
under
article
iii
(a)
in
perpetuity
to
finance
the
projects
that
she
wants
to
build.she
can't
do
it
unless
she
first
establishes
to
your
satisfaction
that
the
three
states
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada
have
a
right
to
the
75
million
acre
feet
at
lee
ferry
as
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin.
that
is
the
submerged
foundation
of
arizona
suit,
the
right
to
the
75
million
acre-feet,
the
right
to
seven
and
half
million
acre-feet,
all
from
the
mainstream.
and
we
say
that
that
--
a
decree
based
upon
that
assumption
would
be
based
upon
an
allusion
directly
contrary
to
the
terms
of
the
compact
and
that
a
decree
so
based
would
leave
this
controversy
in
the
language
of
shields
versus
barrow
in
such
conditions
as
to
be
wholly
inconsistent
with
equity
and
good
conscience.
we
would
be
confronted
by
a
decree,
quiet
in
title
in
arizona
to
2,800,000
acre-feet
upon
the
assumption
that
the
three
states
of
arizona,
california
and
nevada
owned
seven
and
half
million
acre-feet
in
the
mainstream
under
article
iii
(a),
whereas
the
four
absent
states
are
free
at
a
later
time
to
say
“that
is
not
so”,
that
the
three
lower
states
had
available
for
division
only
five
and
half
million
or
six
and
half
million.
and
this
is
a
suit
to
quiet
title
in
perpetuity
to
the
rights
derived
from
this
inter
basin
compact.
now,
i
desire
to
refer
briefly
to
the
question
i
mentioned
earlier
as
to
whether
arizona
has
effectively
ratified
the
compact,
and
if
so,
whether
california
is
released
from
the
--
her
obligation
under
the
limitation
act.
that
comes
to
this.
it
is
a
grossly
equitable
position
for
arizona
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir,
for
the
reasons
i
will
state.
we
say
it
is
a
grossly
inequitable
position
for
arizona
to
hold
california
in
1944
or
1955
to
a
result
that
she
could
not
have
obtained
by
timely
ratification
of
the
compact
in
1929,
namely,
to
our
limitation
act,
enacted
only
on
condition
that
seven
states
did
not
ratify
and
then
by
delay
having
the
advantage
of
that
plus
whatever
rights
she
claims
here
under
the
compact.
if
this
were
a
--
involved
only
arizona
and
california,
if
this
--
if
this
covenant
run
only
to
--
to
arizona,
we
might
safely
ask
the
court
to
rule
that
if
arizona
ratified
in
1944,
we're
--
we
are
released
from
that
covenant,
the
limitation
act.
it
is
a
covenant
which
runs
jointly,
the
six
states.
arizona
is
one
of
them,
one
of
the
six
joint
obligees.
consequently,
we
think
it
essential.
it
is
axiomatic
that
if
one
of
several
joint
obligees
or
joint
beneficiaries
sues
upon
an
agreement,
he
must
join
--
join
the
obligees
for
the
very
reason
involved
here,
to
protect
the
obligor
against
later
harassment
by
suits
by
others.
now,
the
special
master,
upon
that,
held
that
the
upper
states
weren't
affected
one
way
or
the
other.
that
they
couldn't
sue
on
this
california
limitation
act,
i
don't
know
why.
and
that
they
were
not
interested
in
whether
arizona
was
or
was
not
a
party
to
the
compact.
now,
arizona
alleges
a
breach
of
the
limitation
act
by
california.
we
deny
it.
but
if
there
is
a
breach,
the
breach
alleged
is
that
we
claim
more
water
than
we're
entitled
to.
if
there
is
a
breach,
it
runs
against
all
of
the
joint
obligees.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
he
held
that
it
dealt
solely
with
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin,
that
the
upper
states
had
no
interest
in
those
waters
and
that
consequently,
they're
unaffected
by--
whether
california
had
broken
the
limitation
act
or
whether
arizona
could
sue
on
it
but
they
could
not
because
it
dealt
only
with
lower
basin
waters.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
am
unable
to
say
how
he
reached
that
conclusion.
he
just
states
it
as
a
flat
conclusion
that
the
limitation
act
deals
only
with
the
lower
basin
waters,
therefore,
the
upper
states
are
not
concerned
with
it.
now,
what
he
says
is
directly
contrary
for
legislative
history
of
the
document.
it
was
imposed
upon
us
by
the
upper
basin
states
for
their
protection
of
arizona
state
out
of
the
compact.
and
if
she
is
out,
as
this
court
held
in
--
in
the
first
of
these
cases
in
1931,
she
is
free
to
appropriate
water
without
regard
to
the
apportionments
made
by
the
compact.
and
in
such
event,
the
upper
states
would
be
very
much
interested
in
holding
california
down
to
the
limitation
they
imposed
upon
us.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
we
say
that
that
applies
to
any
rights
claimed
by
arizona,
under
the
limitation
act.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
the
adjustment
act
was
passed
in
1940
to
redefine
the
--
the
power
rates
to
hoover
dam.
it
--
it
contains
nothing
directly
relevant
to
our
present
problems.
the
limitation
act
is
an
act
of
the
california
legislature
passed
in
1929
in
response
to
the
demand
of
section
4
(a)
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
the
requirement
of
the
limitation
act
appears
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
itself.
it
is
in
section
4
(a).
section
4
(a)
provides
that
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
shall
not
take
effect
unless
either,
one,
the
seven
states
ratify
the
compact
and
the
present
so
proclaims
or
after
six
months
failing
seven-state
ratification,
if
six
states
ratify
and
california
enacts
the
limitation
act
which
i
referred.
now,
when
i
refer
to
the
4,400,000
acre-feet,
let
me
say
that
the
limitation
act
and
the
project
act
both
provide
that
california
may
have
an
addition
of
that
4,400,00
acre-feet,
one-half
of
the
excess
or
surplus
waters
unapportioned
by
the
compact.
that
limitation
was
a
very
severe
restriction.
california
pleads
that
we
have
present
perfected
rights
in
1929,
that
this
projects
built
using
water
which
had
rights
to
the
extent
of
4,950,000
acre-feet
and
that
we
have
valid
appropriations
of
six
million
acre-feet.
now,
i
should
like
to
come
to
the
claims
of
the
united
states.
so
far,
i
have
dealt
with
those
of
the
states
and
i've
tried
to
demonstrate
that
arizona's
quiet
title
action
could
not
be
sustained
here
except
upon
interpretation
of
the
compact
which
assume
obligations
in
the
four
upper
states
much
greater
than
they
have
ever
heretofore
admitted,
greater
than
we
believe
exist
and
that
a
decree
based
upon
those
assumption
would
be
advisory
and
an
allusion,
unless
they
are
bound
by
it.
the
claims
of
the
united
states
are
in
a
--
quiet
a
different
category.
the
12
million
acre-feet,
united
states
claims
here,
falls
into
four
groupings.
and
the
question
is
whether
these
are
claims
against
the
waters
of
the
entire
system
and
against
all
seven
states,
or
whether
as
the
special
master
found
their
claims
against
only
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin.
of
the
principal
--
the
four
principal
categories
are
as
follows,
first,
the
government
claims
water
to
serve
its
treaty
with
mexico
in
amount
of
1,500,000
acre-feet
measured
up
to
boundary.
article
10
of
the
treaty
expressly
guarantees
this
delivery
and
i
quote
“from
any
and
all
sources.”
it
is
a
systemwide
obligation.
now,
recall
that
article
iii
(c)
of
the
compact
provides
that
the
--
this
water
from
mexico
shall
come
out
of
the
surplus.
and
if
this
surplus
is
deficient,
the
upper
basin
states
must
supply
half
of
the
deficiency.
certainly,
it
would
be
impossible
for
this
court
to
find
that
arizona,
california
and
nevada
must
yield
the
water
to
supply
the
mexican
water
treaty
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
court
without
these
four
upper
states
present
to
decide
what
proportion
of
it
they
must
yield.
because
the
quantity
that
each
of
the
two
basins
must
yield
from
its
own
consumptive
uses
is
fixed
by
the
quantity
of
the
surplus
which
is
to
first
bear
of
the
mexican
burden
and
the
quantity
of
the
surplus
in
turn
depends
upon
whether
arizona
and
the
lower
basin
states
can
or
cannot
use
the
million
and
a
half
acre-feet
of
it
without
any
accounting
as
salvaged
water.
the
second
category
that
the
government
claims
for
is
for
indians
in
arizona
and
california,
a
million
and
three
quarters
acre-feet
of
diversion
rights.
it
alleges
that
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
the
use
of
water
are
in
no
way
subject
to
or
affected
by
the
colorado
river
compact.
and
it
specifically
denies
that
the
indian
uses
are
to
be
charged
to
the
basin
and
to
the
state
in
which
they're
located.
the
government's
indian
claims
are
therefore
claims
against
the
waters
of
the
entire
system.
they
existed
before
the
compact
did.
the
compact
relates
that
these
indian
claims
are
unaffected
by
it
and
the
government
we
know
intends
to
assert
that
these
indian
claims
are
therefore
waters
which
are
claims
against
the
entire
system
independent
of,
ahead
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
we
will
resist
that
claim
with
a
proper
time,
but
the
united
states
and
its
motion
here
for
a
determination
of
certain
legal
issues
including
that
one,
i
told
you
on
october
20th
that
if
the
indian
claims
are
held
to
be
against
the
river,
as
distinguished
from
the
lower
basin,
as
defined
by
the
colorado
river
compact,
that
conclusion
would
have
far
reaching
effect
upon
the
interest
of
all
the
states
to
the
colorado
stream
system
and
it
would.
now,
the
issue
where
the
water
for
the
indians
is
to
come
from
is
in
the
case,
its
here
now,
this
is
not
an
additional
issue.and
that
issue
must
be
decided,
it
requires
a
joinder
of
the
absent
states
to
whom
we
share
that
burden.
now,
the
third
category
puts
united
states
claims
water
as
to
serve
the
contracts
that
--
that
it
has
made
under
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
these
aggregate
about
eight
and
a
half
million
acre-feet,
they
are
to
be
supplied
from
storage
at
hoover
dam.
this
quantity,
the
government
--
the
government
alleges
that
all
of
these
contracts
were
valid
and
binding
obligations.
all
three
of
these
states
now
here
rely
upon
such
contracts,
arizona,
california
and
nevada.
now,
the
eight
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
covered
by
these
contracts
manifestly
must
include
some
surplus
because
arizona
conceives
that
she
uses
on
the
gila
river
one
million
acre-feet,
we
says
it's
two
million,
so
that
in
any
event,
the
water
contracts,
lake
mead,
include
from
one
to
two
million
acre-feet
of
surplus
beyond
the
aggregate
of
the
quantity
specified
by
articles
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b).
and
the
question
here,
which
is
one
of
the
gravest
in
the
whole
case,
is
whether
the
united
states
by
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
and
the
impounding
of
the
waters
there
has
appropriated
the
unappropriated
surplus
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system,
and
may
dispose
of
them
by
contract.
that
is
different
from
the
problem
that
confronted
the
court
in
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
or
kansas
versus
colorado,
or
the
other
cases
in
which
united
states
asserted
the
ownership
of
unappropriated
waters
flowing
in
the
stream.
here,
the
problem
is
whether,
by
the
construction
of
works,
an
aid
of
navigation,
the
impounding
of
the
water
behind
the
dam,
the
united
states
has
acquired
title
if
it
did
not
have
it
before
to
the
waters
that
salvaged
and
stored
there
and
may
dispose
of
them
by
its
own
contract.
and
that
is
one
of
the
grave
issues
of
the
case,
did
or
did
not
the
united
states
appropriate
the
unappropriated
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system,
the
surplus
waters
and
may
disposed
of
them
by
contract.
now,
the
special
--
pardon,
sir?
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
disposed
of
the
claims
of
the
united
states,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
two
places,
in
a
total
of
page
and
half
and
he
brushed
them
aside
on
the
grounds
that
the
united
states
had
asked
to
have
its
title
quieted
against
the
parties
to
this
cause
and
claim
that
its
rights
for
adverse
to
the
parties
of
this
cause.
it
had
not
named
the
upper
states
therefore
these
claims
do
not
run
against
them.
well,
if
that
were
the
true
rule,
it
would
dispense
that
all
they
rule
as
a
joinder
that
if
the
united
states
is
an
intervener
here,
did
not
name
the
upper
states
as
defendants,
they
didn't
have
to
be
joined
even
though
its
claims
could
not
be
adjudicated
in
their
absence.
now,
we
just
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
he
says
that
that's
true.
we
think
that
they
--
no,
we
disagree
with
him.
we
think
the
united
states,
by
the
assertion
of
claims
of
12
million
acre-feet,
50%
more
than
the
--
is
awarded
to
the
lower
basin
by
article
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b)
combined,
necessarily
in
larger
scope
of
the
--
of
the
action.
and
that
is
quite
an
addition,
i
might
say,
to
the
unspecified
claims
for
flood
control
and
navigation,
that
to
which
i
come
next.
the
12
million
acre-feet,
to
be
precise,
11,785,000
that
the
government
claims
for
specified
rights
here,
is
an
addition
to
the
claim
it
makes
for
the
right
to
utilize
the
full
capacity
of
the
diversion,
the
carriage
and
storage
structures
describe
in
its
petition
for
flood
control
navigation
and
other
federal
purposes.
now,
what
that
mean
is
this,
that
the
government
claims
the
right
to
discharge
water
from
hoover
dam
to
make
room
for
an
expected
flood.
to
waste
that
water
to
the
sea,
and
of
course,
it
has
that
right,
under
the
terms
of
the
project
act
which
directs
that
the
reservoir
shall
be
used
first
for
navigation
and
flood
control,
second,
for
river
regulation
and
third,
for
the
satisfaction
of
present
perfected
rights.
now,
when
the
united
states
claims
the
right
to
discharge
precipitably
millions
of
acre-feet
from
hoover
dam
to
the
gulf
of
california
destroy
any
opportunity
for
its
consumptive
use.
how
can
it
be
said
that
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
this
proceeding
is
confined
to
the
rights
relating
to
waters
of
the
lower
basin.
those
rights
fixed
by
the
compact
are
rights
to
beneficial
consumptive
use.
this
is
a
right
asserted
by
the
united
states
to
destroy
water
in
needs
of
flood
control
and
deprive
anybody
with
right
to
its
consumptive
use.
now,
these
are
asserted
as
paramount
rights.
the
government
doesn't
use
that
word,
but
that's
what
they
are.
and
in
this
action,
the
united
states
and
these
states
don't
appear
here
as
equals.
if
these
are
paramount
rights
of
the
united
states
to
release
the
water
for
flood
control
that
we
had
anticipated
a
right
to
use
for
consumptive
use
in
these
states,
it's
a
right
superior
to
any
of
ours.
and
they
--
this
court
held
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
in
1931,
that
the
united
states
may
exercise
its
constitutional
functions
without
regard
to
the
police
regulations
of
any
state,
arizona
in
that
case.
and
if
that's
true,
then
no
consort
of
states
and
an
interstate
compact
may
acquire
for
themselves
in
any
insulation
against
those
government
powers.
now,
that
again
is
one
of
the
gravest
questions
in
the
case
--
what?
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
i
think
not
sir.
i
don't
think
it
would
change
the
constitutional
situation
at
all.
the
compact
exist
only
in
consequence
of
the
consent
of
congress
to
it
but
that
does
not
mean
if
the
states
have
acquired
powers
overwriting
the
constitution
with
ones
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
correct,
sir.
and
also,
there
is
--
i
should
make
this
clear,
that
the
colorado
river
compact
negotiators
in
article
iv
optimistically
wrote
in
their
provision
that
the
colorado
river
had
seized
to
be
navigable.
but
that
if
the
congress
should
find
otherwise,
the
compact
should
still
be
regarded
as
binding.
congress
did
find
it
otherwise
in
sections
1
of
the
project
act
that
directed
that
the
dam
be
built
in
aid
of
navigation.
and
in
section
6,
directed
that
the
waters
be
used
for
navigation
and
flood
control
and
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
in
1931,
the
constitutionality
of
that
act
and
the
validity
of
the
construction
of
hoover
dam
were
sustained
upon
the
navigation
power.
now,
these
are
not,
as
i
say
claims
against
arizona,
california
and
nevada,
these
are
claims
for
federal
purposes
with
respect
to
which
all
seven
states
were
on
an
equal
footing.
the
united
states
asked
an
adjudication
of
its
rights,
and
the
fact
that
it
didn't
name
these
four
upper
states,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
didn't
name
nevada
either.
nevada
hadn't
yet
intervened
when
the
government
file
is
petitioned
here.
surely,
it
does
not
--
by
that
fact
restrict
the
burden
of
these
federal
obligations
to
arizona
and
california
or
arizona,
california
and
nevada.
now,
the
special
master
has
found
that
utah
and
new
mexico
are
necessary
parties
here.
now,
their
interest
in
the
colorado
river
system
relates
only
to
the
tributary.
neither
--
none
of
them
touch
the
mainstream.
utah's
interest
--
utah's
interest
is
in
the
waters
of
the
virgin
river,
primarily,
with
respect
to
the
lower
basin,
and
new
mexico
with
respect
to
the
gila,
very
important
from
the
viewpoint
of
those
states,
but
no
one
has
asserted
any
wrongdoing
against
utah
or
new
mexico
which
is
one
of
the
special
master's
considerations
here
that
we
haven't
alleged
that
the
four
upper
states
aren't
doing
anything
wrong.
we've
made
no
attempt
to
state
a
cause
of
action
against
them
and
they
should
not
be
joined
unless
they
are.
and
yet
he
found
new
mexico
and
utah
are
necessary
parties
here,
nobody
alleges
any
wrongdoing
by
them,
but
they
share
in
a
common
fund
of
water
available
to
the
lower
--
to
the
five
lower
basin
states.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
--
that
is
correct
with
the
point
that
i
am
making
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
the
point
i'm
now
making
mr.
justice
douglas
is
that
with
respect
to
the
waters
of
the
lower
basin.
nobody
alleges
any
wrongdoing
as
to
then.
they're
necessary
parties
only
because
of
their
interest
in
the
common
fund
available
to
the
five
states
in
the
lower
basin.
just
as
we
say
the
seven
states
are
--
have
an
interest
in
the
common
fund
represented
by
the
un-apportioned
surplus.
now,
the
special
master's
concept
of
the
requirements
of
joinder
and
of
justiciability,
i'll
never
to
appeal
with
here
and
then
close
--
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
this
is
a
first
time
in
33
years
that
there's
been
an
opportunity
for
a
determination
of
this
colorado
river
controversy.united
states,
an
indispensable
party,
is
in
court
for
the
first
time.
its
claims
like
those
of
the
states
relate
to
all
seven
of
them,
for
the
reasons
i've
said.
they
affect
all
seven.
the
presence
of
all
seven
states
is
as
necessary
here
to
a
full
settlement
by
a
judicial
decree
as
it
was
to
the
settlement
by
an
interstate
compact,
the
other
method
provided
by
the
federal
constitution.
there
can
be
no
doubt
at
all
that
if
this
were
a
suit
among
none
sovereign
parties,
presenting
the
same
issues
that
are
before
the
court,
the
joinder
of
the
absent
parties
would
have
to
be
ordered
for
the
reasons
i
stated
at
the
beginning.
but
the
special
master
asserts,
without
being
explicit
why,
that
joinder
rules
are
different
as
to
sovereigns.
we
think
that
a
reading
of
the
interstate
cases
will
show
that
the
significant
difference
in
the
handling
of
sovereigns
and
original
actions
here
and
the
handling
of
private
litigants
is
this,
that
the
court
has
shown
significant
concern
for
the
protection
of
sovereigns
as
defenders.
it
has
required
a
plaintiff
that
they
prove
an
original
action
to
their
cases
by
a
stricter
burden
of
proof
than
if
private
defendants
were
involved.
the
court
has
been
reluctant
to
grant
relief
against
a
sovereign
defendant
except
if
were
required
to
do
so.
california,
as
a
sovereign
defendant,
is
entitled
to
benefits
of
that
principle.
when
this
case
comes
to
trial
in
the
merits,
we
shall
assert
that
as
the
principle
as
against
arizona
suit
against
us.
but
the
rules
of
joinder
do
not
conflict
with
that
principle
in
any
way.
the
rules
of
joinder
are
designed
to
protect
defendants
through
litigation
that
will
either
be
futile
or
grossly
unfair
because
other
parties
whose
rights
and
obligations
are
involved
are
not
present.
and
as
a
defendant,
both
against
the
claims
of
arizona
and
as
against
the
claims
of
the
united
states,
california,
certainly
no
less
than
a
non-sovereign
party
is
entitled
to
invoke
these
rules.
the
great
practical
question
which
are
a
joinder
motion
raises
can
be
simply
stated,
can
this
court
decide
both
effectively
and
fairly
as
to
the
present
parties,
how
their
rights
to
the
use
of
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system
should
be
divided
without
deciding
how
large
those
rights
are
in
the
aggregate
as
against
the
parties
whom
we
seek
to
join.
arizona
answered
this
question
in
her
complaint
when
she
expressly
asked
for
interpretations
of
the
compact,
the
inter-basin
agreement.
her
claims,
like
those
of
the
united
states,
we
say
involved
the
absent
states
and
her
claims
against
them.
in
fairness
to
the
state
of
california,
no
less
sovereign
than
the
four
states
we
seek
to
join
here
requires
that
these
be
join
and
forbids
attempting
to
decide,
whether
arizona
or
the
united
states
are
entitle
to
additional
water
from
the
mainstream
while
leaving
open
and
undecided
where
that
waters
to
come
from.
and
if
joinder
is
not
ordered
here,
it
will
be
the
first
time
which
i
am
aware,
that
this
court
has
applied
to
a
sovereign
defendants,
such
as
california,
a
rule
of
law
more
harsh
than
would
have
been
applied
to
a
defendant
who
has
a
private
status.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
i'll
--
i'll
try
to
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
25
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
statement,
we
had
involved
through
all
19
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
he
starts
the
joinder
rule;
he
says
it
is
not
made
applicable
by
rule
92
of
this
court
if
it
conflicts
with
the
principles
governing
controversies
between
states
to
which
reference
is
made
above.
also,
we
comment
that,
as
pointed
out
later
in
this
report,
the
states
of
the
upper
division
in
respect
to
the
upper
basin
have
no
joint
interest
with
the
present
parties
and
so
forth.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
would
--
we
would
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
--
we
concede
that.
we
rely
upon
it,
yes,
sir.
the
master
applies
that
as
the
test
on
jurisdiction.
we
apply
it
as
a
test
on
the
merits.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
in
the
case
of
alabama
versus
arizona,
you
took
up
on
the
--
the
question
of
jurisdiction
on
motion
there
to
leave
the
file
and
denied
it
because
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
if
the
complaint
upon
examination
shows
that
it
would
not
in
effect
state
a
cause
of
action
or
--
or
be
multifarious,
then
you
deny
to
leave
the
file.
mr.
northcutt
ely
(voice
overlap)
and
quite
so.
mr.
northcutt
ely
right,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct,
sir.
there
is
litigation
before
the
court
or
the
absent
states
necessary
to
enable
you
to
make
an
effective
decree.
the
case
now
in
here
is
justiciable.
the
--
there
--
it's
been
almost
a
routine
in
these
water
cases
for
the
jurisdiction
to
be
challenged,
the
point
to
be
made
that
there
is
not
justiciable
controversy
or
some
other
challenge
to
the
jurisdiction
and
under
the
missouri
versus
illinois,
connecticut
versus
massachusetts,
wyoming
versus
colorado,
kansas
versus
colorado
one
after
another,
it
has
been
almost
a
routine
as
i
say
for
the
court
to
take
jurisdiction
and
then
upon
the
final
hearing
after
the
merits
deny
the
relief
sought,
two
entirely
separate
questions.
in
our
view,
the
special
master
blurs
them
together.
now,
there
are
cases,
of
course,
where
upon
the
face
of
the
complaint,
the
release
sought
could
never
be
granted.
that
was
the
holding
in
the
second
arizona
case
here,
292
u.s.,
where
the
court
said,
if
we
perpetuated
this
testimony
where
it
never
become
admissible
and
we
will
not
entertain
the
suit.
mr.
northcutt
ely
there
were
two
orders
as
you
recall,
the
--
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
--
the
adverse
interest
asserted
there
was
that
colorado
had
projects
planned
for
the
indefinite
future
which
if
consummated
would
impair
their
rights.
in
other
words,
if
the
claims,
the
aggregate
of
the
claims
exceeded
the
safe
supply
but
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
correct.
now,
we
say,
with
respect
to
that
that
upon
the
face
of
arizona's
complaint
on
the
united
states
petition,
that
is
precisely
of
the
case
here
because
the
apportionment
made
to
the
upper
basin
had
the
effect
if
the
compact
is
operative
as
intended
of
an
appropriation
immediately
made,
presently
put
to
use
in
perpetuity
that
the
seven
and
a
half
million
acre-feet
apportion
to
the
upper
basin
is
as
though
that
water
were
now
used.
it
makes
no
difference
contrary
to
the
special
master's
feeling
here
that
the
upper
basin
was
not
yet
using
all
their
water.
and
that
consequently,
if
you
add
up
the
apportionment
of
the
upper
basin,
seven
and
a
half
million,
the
claims
of
the
united
states,
12
million
to
reach
nearly
19
million
acre-feet,
there's
only
15
million
at
most
available
at
lee
ferry.
if
you
add
up
the
claims
of
the
upper
basin
states
apportion
of
water,
seven
and
half,
the
claims
of
the
lower
basin
on
the
mainstream,
you
again
find
that
the
claims
exceed
the
supply
by
more
than
two
million
acre-feet.
and
then
consequently,
we
have
here
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
as
we
try
to
indicate,
these
were
federal
claims
and
are
not
so
limited.
they
are
not
limited
on
the
face
of
the
complaint.
we
think
they
could
not
be
so
limited
for
treaty,
for
the
indians,
and
addition
to
the
claims
to
satisfy
its
water
contracts.
they
amount
to
12
million
acre-feet
--
excuse
me.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
not
necessarily,
so
we
do
not
question
the
validity
of
the
compact.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
have
not
suggested
that.
we
have
suggested
that
the
court
is
faced
with
the
problem
of
decision
as
to
where
the
shortage
falls.
if
they
--
if
they
--
if
there
is
not
enough
water
to
enable
the
performance
of
the
guarantee
of
75
million
acre-feet
every
10
years,
and
at
the
same
time,
to
enable
the
upper
basin
to
use
seven
and
half
million
acre-feet
per
year,
then
how
can
the
lower
basin,
how
can
arizona
quiet
title
and
perpetuity
for
us
to
that
75
million
as
apportioned
to
us.
so,
at
some
time,
that
issue
of
shortage
will
arise.
we
say
simply
that
no
title
and
perpetuity
can
be
quieted
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
excess
warrant.
mr.
northcutt
ely
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
there
is
one
result
of
the
government's
claims.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
something
will
have
to
give
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
something
would
have
to
give
and
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
not
revising
it
but
finding
where
the
burden
of
the
shortage
rested.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
would
have
to
decide
if
for
example
the
indian
claims
are
outside
the
compact
from
ahead
of
it,
if
the
other
federal
claims
are
not
encompassed
within
the
apportionment
to
become
ahead
of
it.
and
if
there
isn't
water
enough
left
to
satisfy
the
16
million
acre-feet
that
the
compact
framers
thought,
then
where
does
the
burden
imposed
by
these
federal
claims
rest?
we
say
it
can't
rest
just
on
the
lower
basin.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
might
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
won't
work
if
the
federal
government
--
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
sir.
that
is
not
my
chain
of
argument.
what
i
say
is
that
if
the
government
has
valid
claims
to
12
million
acre-feet,
there
isn't
water
enough
to
make
the
compact
operate
in
full.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
shortage
must
fall
somewhere.
where?
shall
it
fall
entirely
on
the
lower
basin
or
by
some
decree
of
this
court
divided
between
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower?
we
do
not
ask
that
the
colorado
river
compact
be
set
aside
if
that's
your
question.
mr.
northcutt
ely
wouldn't
necessarily
rewrite
the
compact,
but
it
would
as
in
the
case
of
the
mexican
burden,
have
to
be
spelled
out
who's
to
bear
that
burden,
the
compact
does
as
to
the
mexican
burden.
it
says
that
if
the
surplus
is
not
enough,
on
article
iii
(c),
then
the
two
basins
shall
share
the
--
the
shortage
equally.
now,
here
comes
united
states
with
far
greater
federal
claims
in
the
compact
alone.
there
is
nothing
in
the
compact
that
says
how
that
excess
burden
shall
be
shared.
there'd
be
nothing
in
the
compact,
we
say
that
the
--
to
make
an
effective
decree,
the
court
must
have
the
upper
states
here
to
in
some
way
arrive
at
a
fair
sharing
of
that
burden.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
only
if
the
united
states
claims
are
sustained
to
the
degree
they
have
pleaded.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
might,
might
or
might
not,
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
--
that
--
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
--
that
is
quite
correct.
if
or
upon
the
trial
it
should
develop
that
those
party
should
be
here
and
we've
gone
through
the
trial
without
them,
we
have
wasted
a
great
deal
of
time.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
right.
or
take
this
very
question
of
whether
the
united
states
anticipating
a
great
flood,
partially
if
it's
hoover
dam,
and
the
flood
doesn't
come.
that's
happened
with
the
last
few
years,
millions
of
acre-feet
had
been
wasted
to
the
gulf
in
anticipation
of
snow
packs
that
didn't
materialize
in
the
rockies,
human
forecast
cannot
be
perfect.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
sir.
we
can
however
arrive
at
some
conclusion
in
where
the
burdens
of
those
disasters
should
fall.
we
say
they
shouldn't
fall
upon
the
lower
basin
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
no.
we
say
that
if
united
states
discharges
five
million
acre-feet,
let's
say
from
hoover
dam
in
anticipation
of
a
flood
and
thereby
deprives
the
lower
basin
of
the
right
to
use
that
five
million
acre-feet
that
it
is
not
necessarily
to
be
treated
as
though
we
had
in
fact
used
it
and
was
our
apportion
of
water,
that
that
might
very
properly
be
held
to
be
a
burden,
a
federal
burden
upon
the
waters
of
the
entire
system
to
which
equitably,
the
upper
basin
should
contribute.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
northcutt
ely
thank
you,
mr.
mathews
for
your
kindness.
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
with
respect
to
the
points
that
governor
macfarland
has
made,
i
believe
they're
all
covered
in
our
reply
to
arizona's
brief
in
this
matter
and
i
shall
refer
to
them
only
briefly
in
passing.
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
shall
be
delighted
to
come
in
grips
with
that.
here,
arizona
sues
to
acquire
a
title
to
2,800,000
acre
feet
of
the
waters
of
the
mainstream
under
article
iii
(a).
she
alleges
that
california
is
entitled
4,400,000,
about
a
300,000.
it
is
not
a
claim
to
a
percentage
of
the
common
fund,
whatever
the
common
fund
may
be,
but
to
acquire
a
title
in
fixed
quantities
in
perpetuity
so
that
as
governor
mcfarland
has
said,
she
may
proceed
to
build
a
project
that
the
cost
of
many
hundreds
of
millions
to
use
that
fixed
quantity.
we
have
built
our
projects,
there
are
three
of
them.
arizona
alleges
that
we're
using
4,500,000
acre
feet,
and
that's
approximately
correct.they've
built
it
to
cost
of
hundreds
and
millions
of
dollars.
now,
arizona's
claim
is
based
upon
the
assumption
that
these
three
states
having
the
aggregate
fixed
rights
to
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
by
article
iii
(a),
aggregating
7,500,000
acre
feet
from
the
mainstream.
we
say
that
that
is
not
correct
that
the
lower
basin
has
apportioned
to
it,
7,500,000
acre
feet
including
the
uses
on
the
tributaries,
particularly
the
gila.
now,
if
the
court
should
hear
a
decree
to
arizona,
the
fixed
quantity
and
perpetuity
of
2,800,000
acre
feet
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
common
fund
in
the
mainstream
of
7,500,000
acre
feet
and
the
--
and
the
upper
basin
states
are
not
bound
by
that,
then
that
decree
is
based
upon
an
illusion
and
a
fallacy,
a
present
mark
because
the
upper
basin
has
been
recognized
in
the
colorado
river
compact,
know
of
treaty
as
having
rights
which
are
in
conflict
without
assumption,
namely,
a
right
to
use
7,500,000
acre
feet,
an
obligation
to
deliver
75,000,000
every
10
years
at
lee's
ferry,
but
that
75,000,000
is
not
the
7,500,000
common
fund
apportioned
by
article
iii
(a),
that
75,000,000
includes
water
in
discharge
of
the
obligations
to
mexico.
consequently,
as
justice
burton
asked
earlier,
why
are
we
concerned
about
where
we
considered
about
the
position
of
the
upper
basin
if
they're
not.
we
don't
want
to
get
caught
between
a
decree
in
this
case
based
upon
the
assumption
that
the
common
fund,
the
call
of
that,
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
and
available
out
of
their
main
stream
is
7,500,000
acre
feet
but
in
later
litigation
with
the
upper
basin,
it
may
be
proved
as
we
think
it
would
be
that
the
common
fund
which
should
have
been
divided
in
this
decree
is
5,500,000
or
6,500,000,
the
difference
representing
uses
on
the
gila
river
which
are
charged
well
plainly
under
the
compact
to
the
apportionment
made
by
article
iii
(a).
in
other
words,
we
are
thrust
into
collision
with
arizona
by
the
existence
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
the
rights
of
the
upper
basin
and
the
obligation
of
the
states
of
the
upper
division
to
the
lower
basin
are
the
submerged
foundation,
the
submerged
portion
of
the
iceberg.
arizona
discloses
here
only
heard
contest
with
california
and
to
some
agree
with
nevada,
but
that
is
not
the
cloud
on
her
title.
the
cloud
upon
the
2,800,000
acre
feet
of
mainstream
water
that
she
wants
is
the
fact
that
the
compact
--
the
compact
of
the
upper
states
does
not
give
to
the
lower
basin
the
common
fund
which
she
seeks
here
to
divide
up.
it
gives
a
lesser
quantity.
consequently,
the
conflict
is
--
is
imminent.
it
is
here
because
the
decree
here
cannot
divide
7,500,000
acre
feet
of
iii
(a)
water
from
the
mainstream
for
the
lower
basin.
it
isn't
there
under
the
compact.
the
upper
basin
doesn't
owe
it.
if
they're
not
bound
by
the
decree,
the
decree
attempting
to
divide
the
larger
quantity
is
wholly
an
illusion.
they
are
necessary
to
a
decree
that
effectively
disposes
of
this
present
controversy
in
the
lower
basin,
not
because
we
wish
to
enlarge
the
issues
to
bring
new
issues
to
bear
against
them.
we
feel
we're
under
no
compulsion
to
state
a
cause
of
action
against
them.
if
one
is
stated
against
thus
by
arizona,
it's
only
because
the
colorado
river
compact
exist,
because
it
withdraws
some
circulation,
takes
for
the
upper
basin,
the
consumptive
use
of
7,500,000
acre
feet
and
limits
their
obligation
to
75,000,000
acre
feet
at
lee's
ferry
which
includes
mexico
not
just
as
lower
basin
states.
mr.
chilson
property
--
pardon
me.
mr.
chilson
properly
pointed
out
that
the
upper
basin
compact
is
on
a
percentage
basis.
that
is
not
what
arizona
asked
here.
as
justice
reed
asked
--
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
pardon
me,
i
didn't
hear
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
yes.
let
me
clarify
the
answer.
the
colorado
river
compact
in
article
viii
provides
that
present
perfected
rights
are
unimpaired
by
this
compact.
we
alleged
that
we
have
present
perfected
rights
as
the
day
--
as
of
the
date
the
compact
became
effective
in
1929
to
4,950,000
acre
feet
per
year,
all
the
appropriation,
some
dating
to
1877,
some
to
1891,
projects
built
and
using
water
at
that
time,
that
is
1929.
arizona
admits
that
our
present
perfected
rights,
the
hardcore,
the
hard
rock
that
the
compact
cannot
touch
or
at
least
3,000,000
acre
feet
or
thereabouts
based
upon
her
depletion
theory.
consequently,
a
percentage
division
of
the
common
fund
in
the
lower
basin
and
from
the
mainstream,
if
such
were
finally
arrived
at
and
it
might
be
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
after
the
trial
here.
it
may
be
that
there
will
be
some
sort
of
percentage
division,
but
it
must
take
into
account
the
present
perfected
rights
in
both
states.
arizona
alleges
that
she
only
--
or
only
claims
present
perfected
rights
for
some
75,000
acres
under
the
compact,
perhaps
400,000
or
500,000
acre
feet.
powers
must
be
protected
that
the
compact
has
to
begin
in
effect.
you
cannot
assume
that
what
we
are
contending
for
here
is
a
pro
rata
division
that
arizona
is
here
to
get
2875ths
of
the
common
fund
in
the
mainstream,
that's
not
it.she
is
here
to
get
2,800,000
acre
feet
quite
different
perpetuity,
but
if
she
were
here
to
get
--
pardon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
let
me
come
to
grips
with
that,
your
honor.
as
this
court
said
in
wyoming
versus
colorado,
“you
cannot
bill
projects
and
you
cannot
irrigate
upon
averages,
upon
the
recollection
of
the
flow
of
past
years
nor
the
long
term
average
that
you
hope
for.”
projects
are
built
costing
hundreds
of
millions
in
california
now,
the
metropolitan
water
district's
aqueduct,
the
all-american
canal,
palo
verde
works
and
others,
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
based
upon
the
capacity
to
take
fixed
quantities
of
water
to
our
people.
arizona
seeks
here
to
do
precisely
the
same
to
get
fixed
quantities
upon
which
you
will
build
a
civilization,
an
increased
civilization
by
the
central
arizona
project.
those
great
works,
if
built
upon
the
assumption
that
there
is
available
a
common
fund
of
iii
(a)
water
in
the
mainstream
of
7,500,000
acre
feet
later
to
be
confronted
by
a
claim
of
parties
not
bound
that
there
is
not
if
we
then
faced
a
--
a
reduction
in
the
quantities
of
water
available
and
if
for
the
present
titles
were
only
in
a
percentage
of
an
unknown,
that's
all
it
would
be.
those
projects
could
not
be
built
or
finance
upon
that
basis.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
with
respect
to
--
yes,
with
respect
to
priorities,
of
course,
we
cannot
tell
what
the
rainfall
would
be,
of
course,
but
the
whole
schedule,
the
whole
scheme
of
the
appropriation
doctrine
in
these
western
states
is
first
in
time,
first
in
right.
in
colorado
versus
wyoming
and
nebraska
versus
wyoming,
the
junior
appropriations
were
protected
because
to
destroy
them
would
destroy
an
economy
built
upon
them
or
as
the
senior
appropriations
in
california.
now,
first
in
time,
first
in
right.
if
later
there
is
the
inadequate
water
to
meet
all
of
appropriations,
the
junior
appropriations
fail
as
a
general
rule.
interstate,
we
recognize
them
or
a
modification
that
may
be
required
in
equity.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
apportionment
is
7,500,000
acre
feet
in
perpetuity.
i've
heard
their
statements,
although,
there
are
no
pleadings
here
from
them,
of
course
that
they're
using
about
2,500,000.
now,
that
leaves
unused
roughly
two-thirds
of
the
quantity
apportioned
to
them
if
they
got
it
all.
however,
we
have
quoted
in
our
briefs
statements
from
upper
basin
spokesman,
particularly,
governor
johnson
of
colorado
showing
with
upon
one
interpretation
of
the
compact
which
apparently
he
favors.
they'll
never
going
to
get
that
much
for
3,500,000
to
6,000,000
in
consequence
of
this
iii
(d)
obligation.
mr.
northcutt
ely
(inaudible)
what
they
might
be
entitled
to,
your
honor,
and
the
--
that
--
on
that
assumption,
there
would
be
unused
now
some
two-thirds
of
their
--
of
their
apportionment.
let
me
compare
that
with
another
figure.
arizona
says
that
out
of
the
3,800,000
that
she
wants
her
title
acquire
to
do,
there
is
now
unused
1,700,000.
that's
on
the
mainstream
because
she
is
now
using
all
of
the
waters
on
the
gila.
that
is
about
60%
of
the
2,800,000
acre
that
she
wants
out
of
the
mainstream
now
unused.
she
alleges
she
has
a
justiciable
controversy
with
us,
the
master
so
found.
she
is
not
appropriate.
she's
not
used
60%of
the
water.
she's
claiming
from
the
mainstream.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
the
--
the
use
is
on
the
gila
if
they
are
chargeable
to
article
iii
(a)
reduced
by
that
amount
the
quantity
that
is
available
for
division
of
the
lower
basin.
mr.
northcutt
ely
it
would
come
up
at
a
time
when
the
title
here
being
inquired,
it
has
to
be
asserted,
namely,
a
title
and
perpetuity
to
the
7,500,000
acre
feet.what
are
the
points
i'm
trying
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
if
the
colorado
river
compact
is
given
its
intended
effect
of
insulating
now
instantaneously
at
the
upper
basin
from
the
law
of
priority
of
appropriation
to
the
extent
of
7,500,000
acre
feet,
then
that
apportionment
has
precisely
the
effect
of
a
full
appropriation
of
that
quantity
instantly
put
to
use.
it
is
useless
for
purposes
of
perpetual
rights
which
is
under
dispute
here
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
the
upper
basin
is
not
yet
using
5,000,000
acre
feet
if
that's
the
figure
of
their
apportionment.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
compact
was
to
apportion
that
in
perpetuity
and
it
says
so.
consequently,
the
coalition
is
here
now
where
apportionment
--
pardon.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
as
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
as
mr.
chilson
said
earlier,
if
we
were
--
if
he
thought
that
the
lower
basin
was
here
to
acquire
a
title
in
perpetuity
to
a
75,000,000
acre
feet
at
lee's
ferry,
he
would
be
and
not
only
protesting
but
intervening.
and
that
is
precisely
what
arizona's
case
is
dependent
upon.
if
there
isn't
a
title
acquired
in
the
three
mainstream
states
in
the
lower
basin,
arizona,
california,
and
nevada
to
that
75,000,000
acre
feet
for
decade
as
though
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
by
article
iii
(a),
there
isn't
a
total
which
he
alleges
to
be
divided
here
of
4,400,000
to
california,
300,000
to
nevada,
2,800,000
to
arizona.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
the
compact
says
it's
an
apportionment
in
perpetuity
to
the
upper
basin
into
the
lower
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
i
think
that's
--
that's
correct,
but
that
is
not
the
problem
we
have
here.
the
problem
is
whether
arizona's
title
shall
be
acquired
of
the
2,800,000
on
the
assumption
as
the
common
fund
of
7,500,000
when
as
a
matter
of
law
there
is
not.
it's
true
that
even
if
a
matter
of
law
there
were,
we
might
both
be
disappointed
by
the
rainfall.
but
the
question
here
is
now
whether
arizona
is
correct
or
wrong
in
her
assertion
of
the
law.
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
is
7,500,000
common
fund
under
iii
(a)
in
the
mainstream
and
there's
not.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
--
that's
it.
we
don't
want
a
legal
decree
against
us
based
upon
the
assumption
of
the
common
fund
being
divided
by
the
decree
as
one
to
2,000,000
acre
feet
is
bigger
than
it
is.
and
it
was
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
it
must
decide
it.
it
must
decide
it,
but
my
point
is
that
you
can't
decide
it
until
they
know
how
large
the
fund
is
you're
dividing.
you
can't
know
that
unless
the
upper
basin
is
bound
by
that.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
but
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
the
point
is
that
arizona
is
asking
for
a
definition
of
the
very
term
that
makes
the
division
between
basins'
beneficial
consumptive
use.
this
is
an
area
division
for
administrative
purposes.
it
is
a
formula
division,
a
mathematical
division
for
purposes
dividing
the
water.
arizona's
whole
prayer
as
mr.
justice
reed
pointed
out
earlier
for
paragraph
number
5
is
for
a
definition
of
the
term
“beneficial
consumptive
use,”
which
is
the
very
engine
that
affects
the
division
between
basins
of
their
water
rights.
you
cannot
have
a
determination
of
the
quantity
of
water
available
for
the
lower
basin
unless
you
answer
arizona's
prayer
number
5
for
a
determination
of
the
meaning
of
consumptive
use
as
between
basins.
that's
a
compact
term,
and
that's
what
she
wants
to
construe.
mr.
northcutt
ely
but
the
case
--
the
case
hinges
upon
whether
there
is
7,500,000
acre
feet
of
iii
(a)
water
in
the
mainstream.
if
there
is
a
compact,
it
must
be
rewritten
to
exclude
the
gila
from
article
iii
(a).
it
hinges
upon
whether
basin
versus
basin.
the
rights
are
measured
by
beneficial
consumptive
use
under
one
formula
or
the
other.
it
is
as
though
you
had
a
common
fund
between
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
in
which
one
group
of
partners
contended
that
the
rights
were
fixed
in
dollars,
the
other
in
pesos.
now,
you
might
be
able
to
translate
or
interpolate
between
dollars
and
pesos,
but
you
can't
have
each
group
of
partners
saying
for
himself,
“my
rights
are
$7,500,000.
your
rights
are
7,500,000
pesos,”
or
vise
versa.
there
have
to
be
a
common
value
in
both
basins
or
you
have
no
division
between
basins,
the
compact
dispels
its
purpose.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
she
asked
to
have
a
title
acquired
in
the
perpetuity
certainly
as
against
us
of
the
2,000,000
acre.
now,
there
is
not
the
common
fund
available
to
the
three
of
us
since
she
alleges
there
is.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that
is
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
then
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
we
would
certainly
say
not
but
we
would
have
a
decree
against
this
query
title
against
us
in
that
quantity
based
upon
the
assumption
of
the
common
fund
that's
bigger
than
it
is.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
i'm
not
speaking
of
a
--
of
a
risk
of
the
rainfall.
i'm
talking
of
the
legal
question
of
whether
the
colorado
river
compact
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
7,500,000
acre
feet
under
article
iii
(a)
in
perpetuity
out
of
the
mainstream
or
that
quantity
of
the
mainstream
and
the
tributaries.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
perhaps
physically,
as
so
much
physical
waters
available
but
there's
certainly
no
condition
or
contingency
attached
to
refer
for
a
relief
as
against
us.
she
wants
a
decree
to
go
against
us
for
2,800,000
on
the
mainstream,
and
we
say,
“you
can't
have
2,800,000
on
the
mainstream
under
iii
(a).”
let
me
emphasize
this.
we
do
not
contest
arizona's
rights
of
2,800,000
acre
feet
under
article
iii
(a)
from
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system
including
the
gila.
we
plead
that.
we
concede
that
the
far
limitation
act
is
in
effect.
arizona
and
nevada,
utah,
new
mexico
may
divide
up
3,100,000
among
them
as
they
see
fit.
we
do
say
she
has
no
right
to
2,800,000
of
iii
(a)
water
out
of
the
mainstream,
so
that
when
this
final
decree
is
written
after
the
trial,
and
it
may
become
necessary
to
write
some
degree
of
percentages
to
take
care
of
shortages.
the
question
is
whether
arizona
has
2,800,000
of
iii
(a)
water
out
of
the
mainstream
or
doesn't.
we
say
she
doesn't
because
the
three
of
us
don't
have
7,500,000.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
surely.
the
--
we
filed
our
--
our
motion
to
join
the
four
upper
states
within
four
months
after
the
united
states
had
filed
this
petition
of
intervention.
now,
as
to
delay,
it
is
now
conceded
by
everyone
that
utah
and
new
mexico
were
necessary
parties
from
the
beginning
that
a
decree
which
had
gone
with
a
--
if
this
case
had
gone
to
a
decree
without
nevada
present,
arizona
didn't
join
nevada,
she
intervened.
without
new
mexico
and
utah
present,
it
would
have
been
a
futile
decree.
they
are
now
adjoined,
we
hope.
we
--
we
filed
our
motion
within
four
months
after
the
government
filed
its
petition.
now,
with
respect
to
the
character
of
these
claims,
it
wasn't
until
the
united
states
filed
its
petition
that
we
knew
what
the
full
scope
of
the
claims
upon
the
river
were,
and
we're
startled
by
that.
as
to
mr.
--
senator
mcfarland's
suggestion
that
i
for
one
told
the
congressional
committee
the
issues
were
few.
they
are
so
far
as
california's
claims
are
concerned
upon
this
river.
the
issues
which
now
bring
us
here
are
the
contention
by
arizona
that
the
states
of
the
upper
division
owed
us
7,500,000
in
mainstream
water.
we
say
they
don't.
that
is
the
fundamental
issue.
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
our
pride
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
yes,
sir.
mr.
northcutt
ely
the
route
between
arizona
and
california
is
simply
this.
we
have
three
projects,
three
projects.
mr.
northcutt
ely
in
existence.
they're
the
only
three
we
have,
the
only
three
we
claim.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
are
using
water.
mr.
northcutt
ely
they
are
used
last
year
4,500,000
acre
feet.
they're
built
to
take
a
capacity
of
5,400,000
roughly.
mr.
northcutt
ely
4,500,000.
mr.
northcutt
ely
3,800,000.
we
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
would
be
cutback
from
5,400,000
to
3,800,000
if
arizona
prevails.
our
senior
appropriations
would
be
cutback
to
permit
new
appropriations
we
made
in
arizona.
the
new
appropriations
in
arizona
are
based
upon
this
assumption
of
the
legal
rights
of
arizona,
california,
and
nevada
in
the
mainstream
which
we
say
is
fallacious.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
yes
sir.
the
--
the
problem
is
simply
this.
if
we
try
this
case
to
go
forward
to
a
decree,
it
must
be
upon
the
one
assumption
or
the
other
as
to
the
magnitude
of
the
common
fund
in
the
mainstream
to
be
divided
by
the
decree.
mr.
northcutt
ely
because
arizona
is
asking
here
to
have
a
title
acquired
in
specific
quantities
of
water.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
whether
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
because
the
decree
in
the
language
of
the
cases
i've
quoted
at
the
beginning
will
leave
the
present
parties
and
the
state
in
complete
uncertainty
as
to
their
rights
until
the
obligation
of
the
upper
division
is
finally
determined
in
some
later
decree.
mr.
northcutt
ely
whether
the
75,000,000
acre
feet
guaranteed
at
lee's
ferry
every
decade
is
water
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
to
be
divided
among
these
states
or
whether
it
includes
water
from
mexico
which
is
not
available
for
division
by
this
decree.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
it's
a
question
of
how
much
we
have
left.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
correct.
mr.
northcutt
ely
no,
what
the
claim
is
in
part,
what
the
claims
of
the
united
states
for
mexico
--
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
right.
pardon
me?
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
right.
thank
you,
your
honors
for
your
--
thank
you.
well
--
well,
thank
you,
sir.
i
kept
you
so
very
late.
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
further
questions,
i'd
rather
try
to
answer
those
and
to
detain
your
court.
mr.
northcutt
ely
that's
between
arizona
and
california
and
nevada.
mr.
northcutt
ely
well,
i
--
the
united
states
has
--
has
been
very
coiled
in
this
matter.
and
the
motion
they
filed
here
asking
for
a
determination
of
legal
issues
indicates
that
they're
very
much
concerned,
because
they
say
in
the
motion
which
you've
overruled
that
if
for
example
the
indian
claims
are
held
to
be
claims
against
the
entire
river,
it
will
greatly
affect
the
relations
of
united
states
to
these
various
states.
mr.
northcutt
ely
we
would
be
glad
to
see
the
united
states'
position
spelled
out
a
little
more
clearly.
i
think
we
all
--
thank
you
very
much
for
your
approach,
your
honor.
