mr.
w.
t.
mathews
if
it
please
the
court.
i'm
the
representative
of
state
of
nevada,
represent
mr.
william
kane,
special
assistant
attorney
general.
i
reappear
here
in
behalf
of
the
intervening
state
of
nevada.
much
has
been
said
by
brother
ely,
representing
the
state
of
california,
covering
grounds
which
was
not
necessary
for
us
to
again
cover.
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
cases,
i
believe,
dealing
with
water.
water
administered
under
the
western
water
law
of
appropriation.
it
is
the
first
time,
i
believe,
that
a
case
of
this
magnitude
has
reached
this
court.
it
covers
sufficient
ground
of
warrant
the
court
in
saying
that
there
is
not
a
single
solitary
question
pertaining
to
western
water
law
which
is
not
present
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
well
stated
the
problem
with
respect
to
an
interstate
creed.
in
the
case
of
state
of
new
jersey
versus
the
state
of
new
york
as
reported
in
283
u.s.336.
this
court
had
this
to
say
at
that
time,
a
river
is
more
than
an
amenity.
it
is
a
treasure.
it
offers
a
necessity
of
life
that
must
be
raised
among
those
who
have
power
over
it.
new
york
has
the
physical
power
to
cut
off
all
the
water
within
its
jurisdiction.
but
clearly,
the
exercise
of
such
a
power
toward
the
destruction
of
interest
of
lower
states
should
not
be
tolerated.
and
on
the
other
hand,
equally
literal
put
new
jersey
to
be
permitted
to
require
new
york
to
give
this
power
all
together
in
order
the
river
might
come
down
to
be
it
undiminished.
both
states
have
real
and
substantial
interest
in
the
river
and
must
be
reconciled
best
(inaudible).
the
different
traditions
and
practices
in
different
parts
of
the
country
may
lead
to
varying
result,
but
the
effort
always
is
to
securing
a
natural
enforcement
without
quibbling
over
formulas.
there
is
a
formula
in
this
case,
if
this
court
please,
it
is
the
colorado
river
compact
of
1922.
i
make
that
statement
for
this
purpose
that
there
is
no
need
of
seeking
another
formula
or
else
just
a
necessity
of
this
court
drafting
a
formula,
it
has
already
been
adapted
by
seven
sovereign
states
of
the
union.
it
is
true,
one
of
those
states
withheld
some
15
years
its
right
to
ratification,
but
today,
it
is
before
this
court.
mr.
w.
t.
mathews
--
in
recess,
that
the
formula
had
already
been
prepared
with
respect
to
the
allocation
and
apportionment
of
the
water
under
the
colorado
river
compact.
so
that
it
is
not
necessary
now
in
our
estimation
for
this
court
to
endeavour
to
rely
on
a
formula
with
respect
to
the
apportionment
and
allocation
of
the
water
rights
that
has
already
been
accomplished
by
the
compact
and
negotiation
of
seven
states,
the
ratification
held
by
six
states
almost
immediately
after
the
adoption
of
the
compact
where
the
result
and
ratification
of
the
compact
some
15
years
later
by
the
state
of
arizona.
now,
the
intervention
of
the
united
states
in
this
case,
to
my
mind,
has
opened
the
door
wisely
for
the
joinder
of
all
of
the
upper
basin
states.
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
under
article
vii
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
the
negotiators
at
that
time
already
considered
the
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
the
waters
of
the
river
so
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned,
as
that
pertaining
to
the
indian
tribes.
however,
from
the
upper
basin
states
adopted
after
a
negotiation,
the
upper
colorado
river
compact,
they
wrote
into
that
compact
in
article
19,
paragraph
(c),
a
very
broad
comprehensive
provision.
in
that,
that
provision
provides
that
nothing
in
the
upper
colorado
river
compact
should,
in
any
way,
detract
from
the
rights
of
the
unites
states
for
the
use
of
waters
within
the
upper
basin.
and
so,
when
we
find
the
united
states
alleging
in
its
petition
and
intervention,
not
only
for
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
the
waters
of
the
river,
stream
system
for
the
indian
tribes
alone,
we
find
that
it
is
bond
its
claims
in
the
lower
basin
to
include
fish
and
wildlife,
to
include
national
parks,
forest
service
and
many
other
departments
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
when
the
united
states
did
that
in
his
petition,
it
raises
a
serious
question
in
view
of
the
fact
that
in
the
lower
basin
in
the
states
of
arizona
and
california,
united
states
lays
claim
to
someone
1,800,000
acre
feet
of
water
for
beneficial
consumptive
use
in
those
two
states
for
indian
tribes
alone.
and
then,
it
alleges
in
his
petition
these
other
projects
which
will
require
water
and
they
do
not
say
how
much
nor
when.
so,
when
we
come
to
apply
the
provisions
of
the
colorado
river
compact
of
1922,
whereby,
the
upper
basin
states
were
apportioned
for
beneficial
consumptive
use
7,500,000
acre
feet
of
water,
7,500,000
acre
feet
of
the
--
of
the
water
that's
free
system
was
apportioned
to
the
lower
basin
states.
the
lower
basin
states
was
split
to
a
certain
standpoint
by
reason
of
the
inclusion
therein,
apportions
of
utah
and
new
mexico
for
the
smaller
portion
of
arizona
allocated
to
the
upper
division.
now,
that
amount
of
water
was
apportioned
by
negotiators
and
perpetuity.
then,
in
article
iii
(b),
the
same
negotiators
extend
that
right
to
the
lower
basin
states
to
the
extent
of
1,000,000
acre
feet
per
annum
in
addition
for
beneficial
consumptive
use.
those
are
matters
stands
before
this
court
today.there
is,
in
our
opinion,
a
direct
final
basic
apportionment
of
water
to
the
lower
basin
for
beneficial
consumptive
use
of
8,500,000
acre
feet
of
water.
very
well,
where
does
the
quick
both
of
this
water
comes
from?
it
arises,
i'm
sure,
and
this
court
could
take
judicial
knowledge
of
that
fact.
that
could
create
apportionment
of
that
water
arises
in
wyoming
with
a
greater
portion
in
colorado,
the
smaller
portion
in
utah
borders,
likewise
in
new
mexico.
so
that
those
upper
basin
states
are
faced
with
this
problem,
that
when
8,500,000
acre
feet
of
water
are
put
to
a
beneficial
consumptive
use
in
the
lower
basin
and
i
assure
this
court
that
the
need
is
presently,
not
1963,
but
now.
so
that
when
you
couple
with
that,
750,000
acre
feet
of
water
per
annum
from
the
upper
basin
which
must
go
to
mexico,
that
is
not
a
beneficial
consumptive
use
in
this
country,
that
is
true,
but
it
is
a
beneficial
use
in
this
respect
insofar
that
the
use
of
that
water
beneficially
in
this
state,
except
perhaps
for
the
generation
of
power
for
a
short
time
is
lost
to
the
states
of
the
united
states
along
the
colorado
river.
then,
you
add
to
that
what
united
states
claim,
there
is
no
definite
allocation
here
of
water
to
the
united
states
from
the
colorado
river
compact,
neither
is
there
a
definite
allocation
of
water
to
united
states
in
the
boulder
canyon
project
act.
and
on
that
question,
i
desire
to
state
most
and
privately
to
this
court
that
united
states
is
definitely
bound
by
the
colorado
river
compact
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
so
bounded
in
the
project
act
in
section
8
and
section
13
(b)
of
that
act,
and
to
make
sure
that
that
matter
would
continue
in
that
status
when
they
adopted
the
boulder
canyon
project
adjustment
act.
several
years
later,
congress
took
particular
pains
to
reenact
the
provision
of
section
14
of
the
project
act
and
amended
section
18
of
the
adjustment
act,
making
that
a
definite
holding
so
far
as
congress
is
concerned,
so
that
we
have
the
situation,
if
the
court
please,
that
notwithstanding
the
petition
of
the
united
states
for
america
in
this
case.
in
one
of
the
allegations
of
their
petition,
they
denied
or
rather,
united
states
denies
that
it
is
bound
by
the
terms
of
that
compact,
notwithstanding
expressed
language
expressed
by
congress.
how
does
that
affect
this
particular
case
at
the
state
of
wyoming
and
colorado,
widely
intricate
in
this
matter,
or
are
they
as
they
claim,
having
settled
the
rights
among
themselves
in
their
probation?
they
are
not
concerned
with
what
goes
on
in
the
lower
basin.
i'd
say
in
my
opinion
that
that
statement
and
that
holding
on
the
part
of
those
two
featured
states
as
far
have
fetched.
they
have
agreed
that
so
much
the
waters
will
go
down
in
the
colorado
river.
they
have
agreed
that
the
lower
basin
should
be
entitled
to
so
many
acre
feet
of
water
per
annum.
they
have
agreed
that
they
will
not
withhold
water
in
the
upper
basin,
and
the
lower
basin
has
agreed
it
will
not
require
the
deliberative
water
which
cannot
be
placed
to
reasonable
beneficial
consumptive
use.
but
nevertheless,
how
can
they
say
that
they
are
not
interested
in
what
goes
on
to
the
lower
basin
with
respect
to
the
waters?
because
if
they
take
that
attitude
and
--
and
oddly
by
for
a
period
of
time
and
the
lower
basin
goes
ahead
and
uses
that
water
as
it
comes
down
to
the
stream,
then
at
some
later
date,
perhaps,
five
years
from
now,
10
years
from
now,
the
upper
basin
states
will
be
before
this
court
saying,
“the
lower
basin
has
exceeded
its
powers.”
they're
taking
the
water
that
belongs
to
us
over
a
period
of
years
and
we
wish
to
have
it
stopped.
that
brings
up
a
question,
if
this
court
please,
that
we
now
have
a
situation
that
confronted
this
court
back
in
241
u.s.,
the
pacific
livestock
company
case
construing
the
water
law
of
the
state
of
oregon.
this
court
followed
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
this
--
of
that
state.
upon
this
point,
there
had
been
an
adjudication
of
the
water
rights
under
the
oregon
law,
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
in
advance
of
the
determination
of
those
rights.
first,
they
were
adjudicated.
we
have
that
situation
here.
they're
adjudicated
under
the
colorado
river
compact.
so,
in
all
that
remains
in
this
case
at
the
present
time,
if
this
court
please,
is
only
an
interpretation
of
the
boulder
canyon
project
act
as
it
relates
to
water
problems
of
both
the
upper
and
lower
basin
states.
when
that
judicial
interpretation
of
the
compact,
drawing,
flying
to
the
conclusion
as
to
what
that
language
means,
then,
i
assure
this
court
that
the
case
can
be
very
quickly
dispose
off.
mr.
w.
t.
mathews
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
devote
my
time
in
history.
they
may
use
my
time
on
this
basis.
