(inaudible)

what
do
you
say
to
that
denial
upon
relevant
intervention
of
asking
(inaudible)
justice
william

douglas
just
to
the
vested
rights
of
colorado
to
(inaudible)
based
by

of
the

that
this

was
brought

up
to
that

at
the
time
of
that
amendment
of
that
claim,
the
place
wasn't
there.
justice
william

he
says

says
that
the
claimant

what

at
which
--
justice
william

douglas
well,
does
it
--
does
it
apply
in
that?
was
the
question
applied
to
the
upper
basin?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
comes
back
in
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're,
correct,
the
difference
between
what
you
took
out
and
what
you
put
back.
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
was
the
case
of
other
things
that
come
in
that
depended

in

mexico
and
like
the
other

as
to
how
you're
going
to
measure

measure
this
water.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn't
say
that's
too
far
in
the
future.
