justice
felix
frankfurter
united
states
isn't
before
us
formally
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
intervened.
but
i
mean,
is
not
a
party
to
this
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
us
why
the
master
held
that
this
covenant
--
this
was
not
a
covenant
by
means
of
the
upper
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
that
in
the
limitation
act,
they
designed
what
annual
consumptive
use
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
event
of
the
united
states
to
these
compacts
wouldn't
qualify
your
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
another
way
of
putting
it,
isn't
that
united
states
(inaudible)
didn't
you
say
that
--
there's
no
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps
the
government
has
(inaudible)
does
he
make
--
does
he
make
a
detention
explicitly
to
which
you
just
made
(inaudible)
--
that
we
say
that
the
cause
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
case,
it
should
be
on
the
merits
as
with
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
your
argument
about
a
few
minutes,
it
is
that
different
criteria,
different
considerations
come
into
operation
in
a
litigation
asking
these
states
from
those
who
should
be
operating
(inaudible)
that
was
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
proposition
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
not
letting
a
process
of
this
court
issue
against
a
state
and
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
this
problem
raises
is
what
should
be
the
governing
consideration
when
there
isn't
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
cataclysm
of
nature
might
bring
about
the
failures
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
finish
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
go
back
to
the
indian
tribe?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
it
was
informed
by
even
most
of
unions
of
arizona
and
that
the
border
issued
to
indians
divided
by
the
upper
and
lower
basin,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
currently
would
be
the
--
if
you
got
the
constitution
of
the
indians
and
the
responsibility
of
the
claim
of
united
states
in
regard
(inaudible)
affect
the
permanent
reward
that
would
--
which
would
fulfill
that
grant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
the
claim
is
made
by
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
both
for
in
such
(inaudible)
the
government
claimed
it
really
be
the
minimum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
i
mean
--
the
purposes
of
this
joinder.
justice
felix
frankfurter
aimed
because
of
the
term
of
the
compact
and
because
of
the
factual
operation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
specific
on
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
which
this
court
might
disagree
when
it
comes
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
following
that
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
right,
then
if
the
upper
basin
states
were
in
destroying
by
unlikelihood
by
the
people
of
the
united
states,
they
could
just
fold
their
arms
and
say,
you
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
are
not
involved,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
if
a
joinder
in
california,
this
isn't
often
the
solution
to
remote
the
contention,
vague
controversy
and
to
join
the
states
and
afford
to
fold
their
arms
that
they
will
have
to
go
in
to
this
remote
speculated
--
effectuated
problem
and
therefore
the
litigation
could
be
drawn
out,
is
that
the
--
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
frank,
could
you
please
step
up
to
answer
these
questions.
one,
is
it
common
ground
that
the
proportion
of
water
which
california
and
arizona
respectively
get
should
be
the
same
no
matter
what
the
size
of
the
fund
was,
and
two,
why
should
california
be
found
by
the
intra
upper
basin
state
agreement
with
what
it
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
that
it
agreed
to
divide
it
to
get
300,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
worrying
about
them.
my
question
is
why
should
california
be
bound
by
any
agreement
made
among
the
forward
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
if
those
definitions
may
affect
the
practical
results
of
the
water
that
comes
down
for
the
water
that's
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
about
the
second
point,
the
apportionment
within
those
two
--
are
the
ratios
constitutes
no
matter
what
the
problem
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
that
was
(inaudible)
depending
on
--
on
upper
basin
water?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
those
cases.
these
are
your
cases
where
a
case
of
a
compact
nor
a
litigation
involving
the
construction
as
indicated
and
articulated
legal
document
by
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
it
has?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
doesn't
have
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
today,
suddenly
it
might
be
a
temporary
issue.i
just
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
might
just
--
that
is
to
my
concern
as
to
which
i'm
not
here
yet,
namely,
whether
there's
an
agreement
to
the
common
ground
as
that
the
ratio
there
between
the
states
should
remain
the
same.
and
if
that
isn't
so,
then,
percentage
as
to
the
(inaudible)
would
make
a
difference
with
regard
to
the
ratio
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
before
us
and
--
just
to
develop
a
question
of
like
terms,
numerical
demands.
i'm
saying
that
the
numerical
demand
depends
on
the
subject
of
our
common
changes,
not
the
base
changes
on
the
ratio
to
say
that
it
follow
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
you're
saying
there's
no
likelihood
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
percentage
basis
may
be
affected
by
the
(inaudible)
and
by
changes,
rapid
changes
and
population,
you've
indicated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
arizona
10
years
from
now
might
be
tripling
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statement
of
(inaudible)
on
what
factor
they
went
wrong
that
even
within,
we
say,
the
long
period
of
time,
not
so
long,
(inaudible).
what
factor
did
they
go
wrong
that
we
have
assurance,
arizona
has
been
going
wrong
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
for
10
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
among
the
forum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
before
you
move
on,
why
is
that
the
cases
put
by
justice
black
that
the
lower
basin
(inaudible)
just
that
amount
no
matter
what
in
perpetuity?
why
if
you
were
not
brought
in
or
sought
to
be
brought
in
by
either
parties
that
you
should
be
rushing
in,
hence,
you
wouldn't
be
bound
by
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
just
the
mere
--
mere
protection
that
you
have
if
you're
not
bound
by
a
judgment,
then
you're
not
protected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short
--
in
short
determination
to
which
--
by
which
it
would
not
be
bound
on
the
legal
doctrine
of
res
judicata
and
they
have
consequences
beyond
res
judicata.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
with
my
bill
of
proposition
that
there
may
be
consequences
to
you
that
res
judicata
would
be
observed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
interbasin
isn't
intrabasin
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
interbasin
is
not
intrabasin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
you
don't
--
you
don't
want
them
to
speak
their
motion
to
find
these
of
altruism
into
your
intrabasin
affair.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
harlan,
the
thrust
of
his
question
is
that
this
litigation
couldn't
--
there
have
been
intrabasin
concerned,
as
far
as
it's
involved
in
the
interplay
of
any
between
the
basin
therefore
intrabasin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
it
was
stressed
down
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
intra
north,
upper
four-state
arrangement
that
are
going
to
be
affected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
referring
from
what
you
said
that
the
concept
beneficial
consumptive
use
may
have
on
content
in
upper
basin
and
other
content
in
lower
basin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
different
methods
of
measurement
may
bring
about
interest
results
to
the
detriment
of
the
interrelationship
of
the
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
will
always
get
same
result?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
empty
controversy
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
make
--
may
that
make
a
sizable,
a
sizable
effect
upon
results,
namely,
how
much
water
what
is
so-called
volume
of
water
that
this
company
gets.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
result
of
the
first
of
those
findings
(inaudible)
that
the
problem
of
any
suggestion
that
the
concept
or
the
way
the
lower
basin
to
date
worked
out
what
is
beneficial
consumptive
use
ought
not
to
be
imposed
under
the
upper
basin
states.
the
thought
appears
to
me
that
the
upper
basin
states
can't
divide
their
own
mode
of
measurement
which
made
serious
effect
of
all
basin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
then,
then
they
cannot
trade
this
compact
if
divided
into
half.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
based
to
that
compact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
administrative
division
for
certain
purposes
but
it's
with
one
concept
that
seven
states
then
became
six
states
and
it's
now
seven
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
certain
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
dealing
with
one
system
with
one
water
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
lower
basin
is
dependent
with
certain
circumstances
upon
the
other.
therefore,
if
you
have
to
say
it's
only
--
(inaudible)
to
have
opinion
and
i
meant
to
say
there
are
two
separate
systems
here
just
as
an
accurate
thing
on
only
one,
there's
one
system
which
has
the
vision
for
certain
purposes
that
the
two
are
interrelated
which
is
given
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
borrow
from
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ely,
what
(inaudible)
the
architecture
of
your
argument
if
i
ask
you
to
state
at
the
outset
why
the
claim
you've
made
it
approved
nor
speculated
to
continue
wholly
apart
from
any
question
of
this
issue
of
(inaudible)
case
of
controversy,
(inaudible)
and
not
in
the
rest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
she
isn't
worried
because
of
the
practical
matter
because
she
didn't
see
it
fit
this
is
not
going
to
affect
the
available
water
supplies
in
the
upper
basin.
you're
concerned
not
to
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ely,
did
you
comment
on
the
delay
of
the
other
rights
of
california
in
presenting
the
--
their
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
united
states
is
really
unaffected
by
--
unaffected
plainly
by
the
states
on
this
question.i
am
--
surely,
united
states
isn't
here.
i
suppose
they're
not
interested
in
the
outcome.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
on
the
merits
and
that's
how
you
enjoin
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that
we
have
--
i
knew
they
were
interested
on
the
merits
but
whether
the
upper
basin
states
come
in
to
confess
(inaudible)
or
not.
no
matter
how
that
issue
comes
out,
that
--
they
make
no
difference.
oh,
yes,
their
last
motion
indicated
this,
was
indicated
on
(inaudible)
[laughter]
