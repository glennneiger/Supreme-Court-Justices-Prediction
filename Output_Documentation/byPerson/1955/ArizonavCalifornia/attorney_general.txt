mr.
attorney
general
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
try
to
be
brief
as
the
hour's
late.
in
this
brief
concluding
statement,
i
want
first
of
all
to
say
a
personal
word
about
the
late
george
i.
haight,
the
special
master
to
whom
this
court
confided
the
task
of
considering
the
motion
made
by
california
to
enclave
the
upper
basin
states.
he
was
a
member
of
the
illinois
bar
and
of
the
bar
of
this
court.
his
report
on
the
motion
is
the
crowning
achievement
of
illustrious
career.
i
hope
this
court
will
sustain
it
in
every
particular.
now,
may
it
please
the
court.
we've
heard
the
arguments
in
this
case
by
counsel
on
both
sides.
the
law
is
pretty
well
set
forth,
but
i
would
like
to
sum
up
those
arguments
and
then
to
try
it
because
i
think
that
law
is
pretty
well
settle.
it
is
settled.
i
would
like
to
try
to
apply,
if
you
please,
the
facts
to
that
argument.
now,
the
--
the
master
pointed
out
the
object
of
the
colorado
river
compact,
and
i
don't
think
that
we
should
forget
the
object
of
the
colorado
river
compact.
what
does
article
i
provides?
the
major
purposes
of
this
compact
are
to
provide
for
the
equitable
division
and
apportionment
of
the
use
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river
system
to
establish
that
relative
importance
of
different
beneficial
uses
of
water,
to
move
--
promote
interstate
committee,
to
remove
causes
of
present
and
future
controversies,
and
to
secure
the
expeditious
agricultural
and
industrial
development
of
the
colorado
river
basin.
the
storage
of
its
waters
and
the
protection
of
life
and
property
from
frauds
to
these
ends,
the
colorado
river
basin
is
divided
into
two
basins,
and
one
apportionment
for
the
use
of
part
of
the
water
of
the
colorado
river
is
made
to
each
of
them
with
a
provision
that
further
equitable
of
apportions
may
be
made.
it's
true
as
it
has
been
just
stated
that
the
compact
is
one
compact,
but
if
the
court
please,
the
division
is
definite.
and
this
action
is
brought
for
the
division
of
the
waters,
which,
under
this
compact,
belong
to
the
lower
basin.
now,
the
proponents
of
this
motion
contend
that
the
upper
basin
states
should
be
brought
in.
i
submit
that
it
has
been
thoroughly
demonstrated
that
the
upper
basin
states
are
not
in
defensible
--
indispensable
parties.
i
think
it's
pretty
well
proven.
i
think
it's
well
proven
that
they
are
not
necessary
parties.
and
the
courts
have
held
from
time
to
time
in
these
cases
that
what
is
necessary,
what
is
necessary
to
make
a
controversy,
there
must
be
a
justiciable
issue.
and
what
does
that
sum
up
to?
to
have
a
justiciable
issue,
you
must
have
an
existing
injury
of
serious
magnitude
or
an
immediate
pertinent
injury
of
the
same
time.what
are
the
facts?
it's
just
been
stated
by
the
counsel
for
the
upper
basin
states
when
the
present
commitments
are
completed,
their
use
will
only
amount
to
2,500,000
acre
feet.
and
then,
if
they
are
successful
in
getting
their
project
adopted
by
the
congress,
their
--
their
total
beneficial
use
will
be
a
maximum
of
4,200,000
acre
feet.
there's
no
threat
there.
there's
no
enough
danger
of
serious
magnitude
in
these
pleadings
in
any
place
or
in
this
record
as
presented
before
the
master,
and
those
are
the
facts.
now,
what
do
the
proponents
seek
to
do?
well
they
would
like
to
throw
in
here
while
we're
going
to
have
the
interpretations
that
might
affect
the
upper
basin
states
wanted
to
the
interpretation.
how
do
we
know
what
the
upper
basin
states
will
contend
for
30
years
from
now
while
it's
even
been
estimated
that
it
might
be
as
long
as
75
or
a
hundred
years
from
now
before
they
would
put
the
beneficial
uses
of
7,500,000
acre
feet
of
water?
what
do
we
know
about
what
the
facts
will
be
at
that
time?
will
there
be
a
serious
threat
then?can
we
look
into
a
crystal
ball
and
say
what
the
issues
will
be
25
or
30
years
from
now?i
don't
believe
we
can.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
--
this
court
has
never
attempted
to
do
so
in
the
past.
and
--
and
as
has
been
held
time
after
time,
you
can't
speculate.
if
we
were
going
to
speculate,
we
might
as
well
speculate
that
california,
that
the
cause
of
this
silting
or
this
salting
water,
ocean
water
would
be
so
reduced
that
california
would
much
prefer
to
use
ocean
water
rather
than
take
it
hundred
--
out
of
the
colorado
river
waters
--
river,
out
of
its
watershed
hundreds
of
miles
over
to
the
coast
or
that
they
might
develop
the
further
river
project.
but
we
were
not
permitted
to
make
such
step
--
such
speculations,
and
i
don't
think
it
is
appropriate
to
do
so.
and
as
justice
speculate
here
to
say
that
the
upper
basin
states
will
someday
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
the
lower
basin
states.
now,
they
talk
about
what
the
federal
government
has
pleaded
in
this
case
in
regard
to
the
indians.
they
ask
only
for
the
use
of
the
lower
basin
states
water.
they
don't
refer
to
the
upper
basin
states
water.
the
upper
basin
states
have
by
their
compact
taken
care
of
their
indians.
and
yet,
the
counsel
here
would
ask
this
court
to
speculate
and
say,
"well,
no
they
--
they've
got
it
in
their
compact.
they're
going
to
take
care
of
it.
but
they
might
not
do
it,
so
you
better
--
they
better
be
dragged
in.
they'd
better
be
fixed
--
put
to
the
expensive
litigate,
even
though
they've
said
in
a
solemn
compact
among
themselves
that
they're
going
to
do
it.‚Äù
so,
there's
no
issue
and
that's
a
reason
why
the
master
in
his
will
found
against
them
in
that
regard,
and
we
could
go
on
here
and
take
one
by
one
and
we
find
that
all
of
their
contentions
are
mere
speculation
that
something
might
happen.
no
justiciable
issues,
no
immediate
threat
of
a
serious
injury.
now,
if
the
court
please,
in
determining
what
might
be
the
facts
in
the
future,
in
determining
--
in
applying
the
facts
to
the
law
as
we've
heard
it
propounded
here
today,
and
as
it
is
set
forth
in
these
briefs,
let
us
look
upon
the
other
side
of
this
case
and
figure
just
what
might
happen
or
what
would
happen
rather,
not
what
might
but
what
would
happen
if
these
parties
were
brought
in
to
this
litigation.
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
to
the
--
to
what
professor
moore
said
in
three
more
on
federal
practice
in
the
second
edition
at
pages
2905,
permit
--
professor
moore
emphasizes
that
a
belated
motion
to
join
will
normally
be
overruled
if
the
hearing
of
the
case
will
be
unduly
delayed.
and
then,
we
have
other
cases
in
regard
to
delays.
one
of
them
is
in
--
is
in
the
federal
court
in
12
federal
rules
foresee
--
rules,
decision,
251,
the
court
said
that
third
parties
had
joint
tortfeasors
would
be
proper
or
necessary
parties
defendant
to
such
counterclaim.
in
that
case,
however,
their
presence
in
the
action
can
be
ordered
only
at
the
discretion
of
the
court
under
rule
20
and
21.our
discretion
should
be
exercised
in
our
position
to
the
motion
in
view
of
the
unreason
delay
likely
to
people
precipitated
by
such
joinder.
the
courts
have
held
that
bringing
in
states
and
litigation
are
serious
matters.
we
had
our
plans
in
--
in
the
first
arizona
case,
but
the
court
said
plans
were
not
sufficient.
there
was
no
immediate
threat
of
diversion
of
water
modern
might
never
be
appropriate.
and
then,
in
the
alabama
versus
--
versus
arizona
case,
the
court,
which
has
been
mentioned
here
which
of
course
the
court
has
permitted.
the
court
there
said
that
you
couldn't
have
declaratory
judgement.
you
must
have
--
you
must
have
a
justiciable
issue.
and
the
court
further
said
that
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
must
not
be
exercised
except
on
their
absolute
necessity.
now,
what
is
--
what
are
the
facts
applicable
to
this
line
of
cases?
take
the
history
of
this
briefly
as
has
been
outlined
here.
the
record
shows
that
arizona,
back
in
1922,
was
a
small
state
struggling
to
try
to
obtain
some
of
the
waters
of
the
colorado
river.
yes,
we
tried
three
times.
we
knocked
at
this
--
the
doors
of
this
court
three
times
and
we
made
mistakes.
the
supreme
court
told
us
so.
yes,
we
did,
we
did
include
the
whole
basin
at
the
--
all
of
the
basin
states
at
that
time
because
we
have
not
enjoined
the
compact.
we
were
not
parties
to
the
compact,
and
we
were
in
a
different
factual
situation.
and
then,
after
we've
tried
every
method
that
we
could
as
the
record
here
will
show
and
as
alleged
in
our
pleadings,
we
turned
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
asked
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
wouldn't
give
us
a
contract
for
some
water,
and
he
gave
us
a
contract
for
2,000,000,
some
2,800,000
acre
feet
unless
a
few
uses
which
have
been
spoken
of
here
upon
the
condition
that
we
adopt
the
compact,
and
that
was
done.
and
so,
then,
we
went
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
--
and
introduced
what
was
known
as
a
central
arizona
project
bill,
and
we
had
long
hearings
on
that
bill.
and
if
the
court
please,
upon
the
last
day
of
the
first
hearings
in
the
senate,
by
the
first
time
the
record
will
show,
there
was
a
resolution
introduced
in
the
senate
to
provide
for
adjudication
of
these
controversies
directing
and
authorizing
the
attorney
general
to
bring
such
an
act.
and
that
was
used
against
us.
that
was
used
against
us
and
--
and
a
similar
resolution,
those
resolutions
were
broad
and
we've
had
theory
of
what
the
consequences
might
be
on
that.
and
resolutions
were
entered
and
were
--
were
used
in
the
congresses
in
the
congress
after
that.
until
to
--
so
effectively,
that
as
was
pointed
out
by
my
colleague
in
this
case,
the
house
judiciary
committee,
the
house
(inaudible)
by
a
resolution
told
us
that
they
would
not
further
considerate
--
consider
this
proper
--
this
project
until
their
rights
were
adjudicated,
and
that
left
nothing
for
us
to
do.
but
here
was
our
situation
as
the
record
will
show,
that
the
federal
government
owned
the
land
all
along
the
colorado
river.we
had
no
way
of
getting
water
out
of
the
colorado
river
without
causing
that
night.
and
so,
we
couldn't
--
we
couldn't
present,
we
couldn't
make
a
justiciable
issue
because
we
hadn't
--
didn't
have
the
means
of
taking
water
out
of
the
colorado
river.
so,
we
went
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
he
granted
us
a
right
way.
and
then,
based
upon
what
we
expect
to
do
in
the
state
of
arizona,
this
action
was
brought
and
we
have
a
price
for
it.
and
we're
going
forward
this
court
for
many
years,
because
we
have
to
have
this
water,
because
as
the
record
show,
we're
already
depleting
our
underground
water
supply
to
a
dangerous
point.
and
so,
we
come
here
and
what
is
the
situation?
we
find,
again,
even
after
all
of
the
statements
that
were
made
in
congress
that
california
is
trying
to
bring
in
additional
parties,
which
will
again
delay
us.
and
if
the
court
please,
will
delay
the
upper
basin
states.
now,
i
know
that
mr.
ely
or
any
of
the
counselor
not
bound
by
statements
made
in
before
a
committee
but
they
just
show
how
the
terms,
what
a
term
of
controversy
of
this
kind
will
make,
how
it
will
multiply,
how
it
take
years
and
years?
you
talk
about
it
being
narrow
on
the
start
and
then
you
join
new
parties
and
you
keep
it
going
and
going.
he
said,
‚Äúwe
believe
that
the
questions
require
to
be
presented
to
the
supreme
court
in
this
matter
all
questions
of
law,
interpretation
of
statutes,
compacts,
and
documents
of
which
the
court
would
take
judicial
notice.‚Äù
i'm
not
going
to
read
all
of
their
statements.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
--
i'm
reading
from
mr.
ely's
testimony
before
the
committee
in
the
--
in
the
congress
of
united
states
found
in
--
on
house
joint
resolution
225,
226,
236
at
page
4097
on
may
of
1948.
and
then,
he
said,
‚Äúwe
feel
that
the
decision
can
be
obtained
within
a
reasonable
time,
within
one
or
two
years
at
the
most.‚Äù
and
then,
with
another
time
because
i
don't
consider
this
material
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
only
read
it
because
it
showed
how
the
delays
that
occur
in
these
controversies
and
how
the
--
the
issues,
how
they
--
they
shift
from
year
to
year.
then,
in
another
time,
he
testified
there
is
no
--
no
need
to
go
further
on
disputes
of
problems
requiring
present
disposition
are
believe
to
exist
between
the
upper
basin
and
the
lower
basin.
there's
no
need
to
determine
the
division
of
the
water
among
the
upper
basin
states.
they
have,
for
nearly
two
years,
been
engaged
in
the
negotiation
of
a
compact
for
that
purpose
and
it
is
believed
that
this
effort
will
be
effectuated.
they
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
then,
that
whether
he
went
ahead
and
testified
to
that
effect,
other
witnesses
testified
to
the
same
thing.
and
then,
if
the
court
please,
a
year
later,
something
like
a
year
after
they
filed
our
answer
in
this
case,
they
come
in
forth
and
for
the
first
time,
asked
that
the
upper
basin
states
be
made
parties.
now,
what
would
be
the
result?
as
mr.
ely
said
and
as
they
testified
then,
there
were
three
--
three
things
presented
before
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
that
they
are
in
the
same
periods
before
this
court.
the
question
of
who
should
stand
the
losses
of
evaporation
but
their
lower
basin
evaporations
understand,
not
upper
basin
evaporations.
the
question
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
upper
basin
states,
and
then,
the
question
as
to
what
is
iii
(b)
water.
and
i
must
differ
with
my
good
friend,
mr.
ely,
in
regard
to
the
effect
of
the
--
of
this
case,
the
second
case
by
arizona,
the
court
there
held
we
contend
that
the
substance
of
that
holding
was
--
that
that
was
apportioned
water.
the
court
said,
‚Äúbut
the
act
does
not
purport
to
a
portion
among
the
states
of
the
lower
basin,
the
waters
to
which
the
lower
basin
is
entitled
under
the
contract.‚Äù
that
it
merely
places
limits
on
california's
use
of
waters
under
article
iii
(a)
and
of
surplus
waters
and
it
is
such
uses
which
are
subject
to
the
terms
of
said
compact.
there
can
be
no
claim
that
article
iii
(b)
is
relevant
in
defining
surplus
water
under
paragraph
4
(a)
of
the
act
for
both
arizona
and
california
apparently
considered
the
waters
under
article
iii
(b)
as
apportioned.
and
then,
they
go
on
and
disposed
that
the
--
and
say
now
the
court
says
on
the
next
page,
‚Äúbut
the
fact
that
they
are
solely
--
solely
useful
to
arizona
are
the
facts
that
they
have
been
apportioned
by
--
by
her
does
not
contradict
the
--
the
intent
clearly
expressed
in
paragraph
(b)
nor
that
the
rational
character
thereon
to
apportion
the
1,000,000
acre
feet
to
the
states
of
the
lower
basins
and
not
specifically
to
arizona
alone.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
court
was
speaking
then
thus
what
they
said
about
3
(b)
(1).
we
contend
this
has
already
been
litigating.
we
contend
that
most
of
these
questions
that
are
raised
have
already
been
litigated,
but
we
couldn't
convince
the
congress
of
the
united
states
if
they
hadn't
there.
so,
we
have
to
come
in
court.
now,
three
years
have
elapsed
since
--
since
we
first
filed
our
petition
for
leave
to
amend
to
--
to
file
a
petition
in
this
court.
three
years,
the
pleadings
are
already
voluminous.
they
amount
to
four
big
volumes
when
you
put
them
together.
this
court
grants
this
motion
there
will
no
doubt
be
other
pleadings
filed
and
if
the
same
length
of
time
is
consumed,
there'll
be
three
more
long
years
elapsed.
before
we
even
get
to
the
issue,
the
history
of
these
cases
shows
that
it
takes
some
seven
--
the
10
years
or
12
years
alot
where
there
are
only
three
parties.
what
will
that
be
if
you
have
seven
parties
and
the
--
and
the
government
of
united
states?
it's
not
unthinkable
to
think
for
15
years
and
then
what
will
happen?
will
a
justiciable
issue
arise?
no.
the
justiciable
issues
will
probably
go
out
the
window,
because
arizona's
economy
will
be
ruined
by
that
time.
we
have
our
plans
now.
we
want
to
go
forward.
what
--
what's
the
result
of
--
of
the
situation
on
the
upper
basin
states?
they
have
their
projects.
the
record
shows
in
the
pleadings
shown.
the
brief
show
that
they
did
go
before
the
congress
and
use
this
motion
to
oppose
the
--
to
oppose
--
to
oppose
this
--
the
granting
of
their
upper
basin
project
by
the
congress.
and
everyone
knows
that
--
that
--
the
members
of
congress
are
human
beings.
they're
not
very
up
to
grant
projects
where
suits
are
pinched.
and
so,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
we
contend
--
pardon
me
if
i
have
gone
overtime
--
mr.
attorney
general
we
--
we
contend,
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
we
contend
that
justice
requires
that
this
motion
be
denied
that
the
equity
of
the
case
is
on
our
side
and
the
law
is
on
our
side.
thank
you
very
much.
