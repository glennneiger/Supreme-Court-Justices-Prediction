mr.
john
p.
frank
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
matter
which
is
before
you,
the
division
of
time
which
has
been
arranged
among
those
of
us
who
represent
the
upholders
of
the
master's
report
is
that
i
shall
address
myself
principally
to
the
case
law
aspects
of
the
matter.
mr.
chilson,
representing
the
upper
basin,
will
speak
principally
as
to
the
application
of
the
legal
principles
to
the
facts
and
governor
mcfarland
closing
for
--
both
of
us
will
discuss
the
policy
aspects
of
the
matter
which
may
relate
to
such
discretion
as
the
court
feels
that
it
has
in
connection
with
the
problem
of
joinder.
however,
while
i
wish
to
discuss
with
you
primarily
the
principles,
both
of
joinder
parties
and
of
justiciability,
i
would
like
to
add
a
word
or
two
first
as
to
the
facts
of
the
matter
pointing
out
those
elements
which
seem
to
us
important
in
supplement
to
what
mr.
ely
has
said.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
quite
so
that
what
we
are
interpreting
here
is
the
colorado
river
compact
of
1922.
now,
the
colorado
river
compact
of
1922
was
adopted
largely
at
the
instance
of
the
state
of
california
for
the
reason
suggested
by
mr.
ely,
namely,
that
this
area
was
in
danger
of
flood
and
also
needed
water
control,
and
therefore,
it
was
necessary
to
put
in
what
is
now
the
hoover
dam
up
here
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
these
waters
below.
on
the
other
hand,
there
was
a
great
risk
for
all
the
other
states
that
their
rapidly
growing
neighbor,
california
might,
under
the
doctrine
of
prior
appropriation,
get
all
of
the
water
if
this
were
down,
and
hence,
it
was
necessary
to
make
some
effort
to
divide
it
up
before
california
could
be
allowed
to
have
the
hoover
dam.
in
this
connection,
the
first
effort
that
was
made
was
the
effort
to
divide
the
water
by
states
to
allocate
so
much
to
each
of
the
states
of
the
basin.
i
stress
this
because
it
proved
impossible.
months
and
months
went
by
of
unsuccessful
negotiation
and
attempt
to
arrive
at
a
division
by
states.
and
finally,
after
adjournments
and
failures,
the
great
compromise
of
the
colorado
river
compact
was
devised,
and
i
stress
that
compact
not
compromised
because
it
dominated
the
thinking
of
the
master
and
is
indeed
in
the
history
of
this
matter
a
compromise
is
important
as
the
great
constitutional
compromises
of
1787.
and
that
was
the
compromise
not
to
attempt
to
divide
the
water
by
states,
but
instead,
to
divide
it
by
basins.
and
so,
a
line
was
drawn
through
here
and
a
provision
was
made
that
there
should
be
two
basins
as
shown
on
the
map
in
the
fashion
which
i
think
is
clear
and
that
the
upper
basin
should
have
the
obligation
of
letting
some
75,000,000
acre
feet
of
water
come
down
pass
lee's
ferry
each
ten-year
period
and
the
dividing
point
was
carefully
put
here
at
a
point
far
removed
from
population
in
either
direction,
a
distance
for
practical
purposes
between
the
diversions
is
as
great
as
the
distance
from
new
york
to
charleston.
and
on
that
basis,
it
proved
possible
to
work
out
the
compact
having
made
the
great
compromise
and
division
into
basins.
and
then,
the
matter
proceeded
in
the
course
of
ratification
and
as
--
as
has
been
said,
the
ratification
proved
slow
in
large
part
for
resistance
from
my
own
state.
and
finally,
the
plan
was
worked
out
of
letting
the
boulder
dam
go
through
in
the
course
of
the
project
act
and
i
would
give
a
somewhat
different
emphasis
to
that
project
act,
and
thus,
mr.
ely.
as
we
read
those
of
its
provisions
which
relate
to
the
limitation
act,
we
understand
it
this
way.
that
california
was
given
a
choice.
it
was
given
a
choice
either
of
getting
the
boulder
dam
after
all
states
had
ratified
or
of
getting
the
boulder
dam
after
six
states
had
ratified,
plus
passing
its
own
limitation
act
in
a
period
of
as
little
as
six
months.
in
short,
as
we
construe
the
statute,
the
limitation
act
was
the
price
that
california
had
to
pay
to
get
the
go
ahead
sign
on
the
boulder
dam
in
the
six-month
period.
now,
that
limitation
act,
which
contained
provisions
which
california
now
contends,
are
no
longer
binding
on
it.
the
act
said
this
statute
shall
be,
"irrevocable
and
unconditional,"
giving
benefits
to
all
the
states
involved.
california
now
contends
that
it
is
both
revocable
and
conditional,
and
that
is
one
of
the
issues
which
doubtless
would
sooner
or
later
have
to
be
decided
on
the
merits
by
this
court.
there
is
another
provision
in
the
compact
act
which
i
would
like
to
stress
which
has
not
been
mentioned
so
far.
and
that
is
a
provision
of
article
iv
(a)
which
is
most
remarkable.
it
contained
a
proposed
compact
for
the
lower
basin
states,
known
as
the
tri-state
compact.
and
this
compact
was
approved
in
advance
by
the
congress,
and
that
proposed
compact
in
iv
(a)
provided
that
arizona
should
have
2,800,000
acre
feet
of
mainstream
water,
plus
the
use
of
the
waters
of
the
hula,
which,
in
effect,
comes
to
the
3,000,000
acre
which
we
are
now
talking
about
in
this
suit.
in
short,
what
we
are
seeking
here
is
exactly
what
is
in
the
compact
to
prove
in
advance
in
iv
(a)
of
the
project
act
in
the
first
place.
that
compact,
after
a
period
of
jacking
between
the
states
was
eventually
ratified
by
the
state
of
arizona
after
the
congressional
approval
but
has
never
been
approved
by
california.
another
event
worth
a
little
more
mention
is
the
1944
contract.
in
1944,
the
state
of
arizona
entered
into
its
contract
with
the
united
states.
that
contract
allowed
to
arizona
exactly
what
had
been
set
up
originally
in
the
so-called
tri-state
compact
that
i
just
described,
namely,
and
allows
2,800,000
acre
feet.
on
one
point,
i
am
over
simplified.
the
allowance
of
2,800,000
acre
feet
of
mainstream
water
to
arizona
includes
the
allowance
for
the
lower
basin
sectors
of
new
mexico
and
utah.
that
is
this
little
area
here
and
this
little
area
here
must
ride
with
us,
and
that
is
why
the
master
found
that
they
had
to
be
in
the
case
because
whatever
we
get,
we
must
share
with
them
in
this
limited
area
of
both
of
those
states
which
is
in
the
lower
basin.
i
use
the
shorthand
phrase
of
our
claim
but
it
is
also
theirs.
it
is
worth
adding
this
as
to
the
1944
contract,
and
that
is
that
since
we
were
not
then
parties
to
the
compact,
it
was
provided
that
as
a
condition
of
getting
the
contract,
we
have
to
ratify
the
compact.
and
california,
among
others,
was
very
enthusiastic
that
we
should.
we
know
this
because
the
contract
itself
was
drafted
in
negotiations
by
a
committee
which
represented
all
of
the
states,
known
as
the
committee
of
14
or
16,
since
we
were
not
then
parties
to
the
compact.
and
it
was
approved
by
all
of
the
states,
except
california
and
then,
upon
full
scale
hearing
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
it
is
our
rights
under
that
contract,
which
are
the
same
as
what
was
allowed
to
us
under
iv
(a)
of
the
compact
which
is
what
we
are
seeking
here.
now,
one
other
element
of
fact
that
need
stressing
perhaps
is
the
fact
that
in
1948
and
1949,
the
upper
basin
states
preceeded
to
prepare
and
adopt
a
compact
of
their
own.
and
that
upper
basin
compact,
which
has
been
approved
by
congress
and
is,
now
in
effect,
settles
for
those
states
all
of
the
matters
which
are
in
issue
here.
they
have
adopted
for
themselves
the
definitions
which
will
have
to
be
worked
out
for
the
lower
basin
in
this
litigation.
i
shall
come
back
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
let
me
go
back
to
the
moment
of
our
contract.
in
1944,
arizona
have
the
contract
and
then
set
about
to
which
he
used
its
contract
for
water?
and
so,
it
developed
a
program
known
as
the
central
arizona
project.
now,
that
project
is
a
program
which
will
lift
our
water
out
of
the
river
here
with
great
lifts
which
are
similar
to
those
which
california
uses
to
take
water
to
los
angeles,
and
brings
that
water
across
the
state
down
into
the
central
area
which
is
where
the
great
drought
is.
and
that
permits
exchanges
down
to
this
area
and
up
into
new
mexico,
so
that
the
central
arizona
project
in
short
is
a
gigantic
reclamation
program
which
has
as
its
purpose
the
using
of
the
water
which
we
have
contracted
for.
that
legislation,
the
central
arizona
project
legislation
twice
passed
the
senate
of
the
united
states
in
both
the
80th
and
the
81st
congress.
it
was
opposed
there
by
california
which
contended
that
before
it
could
be
adopted
the
--
that
there
were
clouds
on
the
title
to
our
water
that
there
were
a
so-called
three
issues
which
had
to
be
decided.
and
those
three
issues
were
spoken
out
constantly
in
the
course
of
the
consideration
of
that
legislation
and
they
were,
first
of
all,
the
problem
of
the
relation
of
article
iii
(a)
and
iii
(b)
of
the
compact
as
it
relates
to
the
lower
basin
states,
a
problem
of
the
definition
of
the
terms,
“apportionment
and
surplus,”
second,
a
problem
of
the
definition
of
the
term,
“beneficial
consumptive
use,”
and
third,
a
problem
of
the
evaporation
losses
and
their
distribution.
now,
as
expression
of
political
matter,
arizona
can
get
legislation
through
the
senate
but
california
has
greater
influence
in
the
house.
and
as
a
result,
our
legislation
founded
in
the
house
and
a
house
committee
there
decided
that
it
would
not
adopt
this
--
this
legislation
without
first
getting
a
determination
of
those
three
issues.
that
was
a
matter
which
was
thoroughly
considered
in
many
committees.
and
doubts
and
fears
were
expressed
by
the
upper
basin
states
that
they
might
become
involved,
but
they
were
constantly
assured
by
the
representatives
of
california
that
this
would
never
happen.
i
quote
that
“there
were
no
issues
respecting
the
upper
basin
states
and
that
hence
the
three
issues
could
be
solved
without
them."
and
so,
after
the
action
of
the
house
committee,
it
became
necessary
for
us
to
institute
this
litigation.
meanwhile,
the
upper
basin,
to
ensure
that
they
will
not
be
involved,
proceeded
as
i
have
said
speedily
to
adopt
their
own
compact
which
settled
every
one
of
these
points.
so,
before
themselves,
they've
decided
what
evaporation
means
or
what
beneficial
consumptive
use
means.
and
then,
we
instituted
this
action.
in
this
action,
we
ask
that
they'll
be
quieted
in
us
out
of
the
lower
basin
water,
that
water
which
had
been
set
up
for
us
in
the
proposed
tri-state
compact,
that
water
which
we
had
contracted
for.
we
ask
that
there
be
determined
the
three
issues
and
nothing
else.
we
were
scrupulously
careful
to
keep
within
the
terms
of
that
which
the
congress
seemed
to
require
of
us.
thereafter,
there
was
intervention
by
nevada
and
by
the
united
states.
the
matter
was
referred
by
a
utah
master
and
finally
some
22
months
after
this
action
was
instituted,
california
made
its
motion
and
i
may
add
a
year
after
the
--
after
it
had
answered,
california
made
its
motion
for
joinder.
he
then
referred
the
joinder
questions
to
the
master
and
the
master
heard
argument
on
the
subject
for
some
four
days
and
inspected
the
area
which
was
involved
and
considered
it
extremely
thoroughly
and
filed
voluminous
report
which
you
have.
now,
the
position
of
the
master,
i
would
like
briefly
to
summarize.
it
moved
from
two
fundamental
conceptions,
and
those
conceptions
were
so
basic
to
everything
that
he
did
that
you
will,
perhaps,
want
to
examine
them.
the
first
was
his
conception,
that
the
division
of
the
colorado
area
into
two
basins
had
been
a
great
policy
decision
which
ought
to
be
preserved.
and
related
to
that,
he
followed
what
he
considered
to
be
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
many
cases,
namely,
that
problems
were
impossible
to
be
solved
by
compact
rather
than
by
litigation,
and
that
since
this
problem
had
been
so
large
in
extent
sold
by
compact,
he
was
determined
to
carry
out
the
principles
of
the
compact.
second,
he
adhered
with
fervor
to
the
principle
that
justiciability
was
required
in
interstate
litigation
as
in
any
other
litigation,
and
that
the
principles
of
justiciability
applied
to
the
joinder
parties
as
well
as
to
all
of
the
other
matters
which
were
involved.
california
had
contended
not
to
come
back
to
this
in
a
moment,
but
the
principal
of
case
in
controversy
has
no
bearing
on
joinder,
and
that
once
there
is
a
main
suit,
any
parties
can
be
joined
without
reference
to
justiciability.
in
this
field,
the
master
did
not
accept.
now,
on
the
particular
issues,
he
decided
that
on
the
question
of
beneficial
consumptive
use
on
the
iii
(b)
problem,
the
meaning
of
apportionment
and
surplus
and
on
the
evaporation
problem
in
essence
is
this.
first,
that
the
upper
basin
had
decided
these
questions
for
themselves.
second,
that
they
could
be
decided
in
the
lower
basin
without
any
regard
to
the
decisions
of
the
upper
basin
except
to
study
and
observe
and
just
consider
whether
they
should
be
transferred
below.
he
said,
"to
disregard
this
action
and
the
other
actions
that
may
follow
under
the
upper
basin
compact,
unless
wholly
necessary
under
sound,
legal
and
equitable
principles,
would
be
enacted
plainly
under
oath
denounced
policies
of
this
court
should
not
be
taken.
now,
the
next
branch
of
the
matter
was
the
matter
which
related
to
arizona
as
contact
with
both
the
compact
and
the
limitation
act.
as
to
the
question
of
whether
arizona's
ratification
of
the
compact
is
valid,
i
should
mention
that
in
the
many
years
which
this
matter
has
been
under
consideration,
that
issue
has,
i
think,
never
been
raised
until
exceedingly
recently.
the
master
took
this
view
that
whether
our
ratification
of
the
compact
was
effective
or
ineffective,
would
make
no
difference
in
terms
of
the
relief
that
we
had
asked,
but
since
all
that
we
had
asked
for
was
not
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
whole
stream
but
merely
our
share
of
the
lower
basin
water,
that
whether
we
were
in
the
compact
or
out
would
make
no
difference
because
we
could
get
only
this
much
anyway
and
the
upper
basin
states
would
not
be
effective.
secondly,
the
master
might
have
considered
the
point
which
we
have
briefed
to
you
in
the
briefs
which
are
now
before
you,
namely,
that
this
is
for
reasons
which
we
have
set
forth
there,
virtually,
a
frivolous
question
in
any
case.
now,
on
the
limitation
act
point,
he
took
essentially
the
same
point
of
view
that
the
matter
need
not
be
involved
here
that
the
claims
were
only
as
to
lower
basin
water
that
that
was
all
that
needed
to
be
considered.
he
dealt
more
briefly
with
the
position
of
the
united
states,
and
that,
let
me
explain
was
because
the
12
acre-figure
of
united
states
claims
was,
i
think,
not
pressed
upon
him
there
as
i
recall
it.
and
so
perhaps
he
didn't
consider
the
number
as
vividly
as
he
might.
let
me
explain
the
figure
which
has
been
used
of
the
so-called
12
acre-foot
claim
of
the
united
states.
that
--
the
claims
of
the
united
states
were
set
forth
in
its
petition
for
intervention.
the
12
acre-foot
figure,
which
has
been
added
up
by
counsel
for
california,
include
something
like
8,500,000
acre
feet
which
is
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
under
all
of
its
contacts.
in
order
words,
it
is
a
complete
duplicate
of
the
amounts
which
the
various
states
claim.
it
is
simply
a
different
interest
representing
the
same
quantity
of
water.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
a
claim
of
7,000,000
or
8,000,000
feet
by
us,
plus
the
claim
by
the
united
states.
these
are
identical.
it
is
the
same.
they
are
saying
that
the
united
states
has
an
obligation
to
deliver
us
what
we
claim
we
have
a
privilege
to
--
to
receive,
and
this
obviously
can't
be
aggregated
as
if
they
were
two
separate
amounts.
the
actual
claims
of
the
united
states
as
set
forth
here
are
747,000
acre
feet
of
diversion
for
indian
uses.
now,
please
let
me
know
if
i
used
the
term
diversion
which
is
technical.
that
means
that
the
water
diverted
for
that
purpose,
much
of
it
will
return
to
the
streams,
but
fraction,
i
don't
know,
but
let's
assume
a
third,
a
half
of
it.
so
that
the
amount
actually
to
be
used
by
the
united
states
under
its
present
claims
is
a
few
hundred
thousand
acre
feet,
and
the
amount
for
fish
and
wildlife
is
another
35,000
--
80,000,
something
like
that.
it
is
said
forth
here.
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
such
claim
as
there
maybe
under
the
mexican
matter.
i
should
take
that
up
in
just
a
second.
but
the
consequence
is,
that
the
actual
aggregate
claim
of
the
united
states
or
what
might
be
called
new
water,
is
somewhere
in
the
nature
of,
let
me
use,
around
a
number
of
acre
feet
depending
on
whether
you
take
its
additional
claims
or
its
present
claims,
plus
whatever
is
involved
on
the
mexican
treaty.
now,
as
to
both
of
those
points,
the
master
reached
this
conclusion.
first,
as
to
the
indians,
the
master
concluded,
that
the
compact
had
allocated
the
indian
responsibilities
to
the
upper
division
and
the
lower
division
separately.
see,
your
honors,
you
cannot
consider
this
as
though
the
indians
were
somehow
just
a
vast
mass
of
--
of
people
known
as
the
indians.
these
are
particular
tribes
with
particular
claims
and
particular
history.
and
the
master
shrank,
as
indeed
he
might,
from
the
problem
of
working
out
the
histories
and
rights
of
any
more
tribes
than
actually
had
to
be
faced.
he
took
the
view
that
these
had
been
allocated
by
the
compact
to
the
division
separately,
and
that
the
only
question
to
be
decided
was
whether
the
obligation
should
rest
on
arizona
which
has
almost
all
of
them
or
whether
it
should
be
spread
over
the
other
states
of
the
lower
basin,
and
as
to
that,
he
found
no
interest
in
the
upper
basin
states.
as
to
the
mexican
burden,
the
essence
of
the
master's
view
was
this.
he
adhered
throughout,
as
i
have
said,
to
the
principle
of
case
in
controversy
to
the
requirement
of
the
existence
of
a
present
need.
now,
the
situation
is,
that
this
area,
the
upper
basin
is,
in
fact,
now
using
something
like
2,500,000
acre
feet
or
what
is
allowed
to
it.
and
if
the
broadest
legislation
now
offered
in
congress
should
be
adopted,
it
would
be
some
30
years
before
their
use
would
increase
to
over
4,000,000
acre
feet.
and
the
view
of
the
master
was,
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
possible
remote
interest
in
such
matters
as
the
mexican
treaty,
was,
i
think,
not
worthy
of
immediate
consideration.
at
least
this
is
the
argument
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
was
trying
to
say
only,
i
think
that
this
is
the
argument
that
the
master
accepted.
he
did
not
discuss
it
particularly.
it
is
what
we
urged
on.
mr.
john
p.
frank
please.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
i
misspoke.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
most
of
the
lower
basin
indians
are
in
arizona.
the
upper
basin
with
their
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
we
submit
not
for
the
reason
that
the
aggregate
of
the
claim
is
not
large
enough
to
raise
this
to
the
level
of
the
justiciable
controversy.
if
we
take
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
claim
that's
made
by
the
government
is
set
forth
on
page
58
of
its
petition,
assumes
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
a
diversion
at
present
of
some
700,000
acre
feet,
which
means
an
actual
use
far
or
less.
and
the
outside
claim
if
the
remotest
indian
reservation
should
put
into
irrigation
its
farthest
acre,
comes
to
only
something
like
double
blast,
so
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
problem
which
need
not
quantitatively
concern
the
upper
basin
in
any
case.
mr.
john
p.
frank
oh,
not
at
all.
and
indeed,
we
shall
--
when
we
come
back
here
on
the
merits,
we'll
doubtless
be
fighting
and
dying
right
here
over
the
question
of
indian
claims,
they
are
large.
mr.
john
p.
frank
what
we
are
saying
is
that
they
are
claims
which
are
aimed
only
at
lower
basin
water
and
that
the
whole
of
the
government
claim
is
so
aimed.
mr.
john
p.
frank
both,
your
honor.
we
think
that
as
a
practical
matter
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
compact
is
not
specific.
the
master
in
his
discussion,
you'll
--
you'll
find
it
headed
there
under
indians
included
that
it
was
the
fair
consequence
of
the
various
sections
so
they
divided
and
that
is
our
view.
the
result
of
all
these
was
that
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
in
effect,
the
master
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
is
conceivable
that
this
court
might
disagree,
but
it
seems
a
reasonably
clear
construction,
and
in
any
case,
we
repeat
that
quantitatively,
we
are
dealing
with
an
amount
which
in
terms
of
the
actual
uses
of
water
in
all
the
foreseeable
future
within
the
lies
of
any
person
in
this
courtroom,
are
not
likely
to
make
this
as
the
master
felt
pressing
conference.
he
concluded,
and
he
was
a
highly
practical
man
and
he
reached
the
highly
practical
conclusion,
that
to
join
the
upper
basin
states
would
be
a
backward
and
retarding
step
with
respect
to
the
solution
of
the
problems
relating
to
the
colorado
river
system.
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
what
the
master
felt
was
this.
it
was
what
we
urged
on
him
and
what
we
are
urging
on
you
here
today.
and
that
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
stupendous
region
of
the
united
states,
a
region
which
is
extremely
diverse
and
in
which
the
development
problems
are
very
different.
up
here
is
an
area
of
high
mountains
and
rich
meadows.
down
here
is
the
most
aired
portion
of
the
united
states.
the
problems
of
how
this
land
should
be
developed
are
very
different.
the
nature
of
their
projects
is
different.
the
nature
their
uses
are
different,
and
the
nature
put
it
bluntly
of
the
--
of
their
political
forces
are
different.
and
the
master
thought
that
these
two
stupendous
regions,
almost
countries
within
america,
should
be
allowed
to
follow
the
coarse
of
development
which
have
been
set
up
in
1922
and
which
had
been
reaffirmed
by
the
adoption
of
the
upper
basin
compact
and
let
them
settle
as
best
they
could
their
own
use
of
their
own
water.
mr.
john
p.
frank
scarcely
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
except,
your
honor,
for
an
important
circumstance
that
you
could
not
bring
them
in
without
at
the
same
time
deciding
that
those
questions
which
the
master
found
distant
and
remote
were
in
fact
pressing
an
immediate.
let's
take
for
example
the
mexican
burden.
it
is
conceivable
that
someday,
mr.
ely's
words
were,
this
is
in
perpetuity
and
sometime,
that
sometime
a
question
of
the
distribution
of
the
mexican
burden
may
become
an
issue.
now,
clearly,
that
is
going
to
be
a
long
time
because
the
mexican
amount
is
1,500,000
acre
feet.
and
by
definition
even
if
the
upper
basin
gets
its
upper
basin
compact,
it
will
not
be
able
to
use
more
than
4,000,000
acre
feet
leaving
a
slack
of
some
3,000,000.
so
that
in
terms
of
all
predictable
likely
use,
it
is
probable
that
it
will
be
50
to
a
100
years
before
this
question
really
pinches,
if
it
ever
does.
now,
it
is
possible
that
an
atomic
energy
may
put
into
the
problem.
it
is
possible
that
we
will
learn
to
get
water
from
the
gulf
of
california
for
example.
it
is
possible
that
great
many
things
will
happen
including
a
diplomatic
solution.what
we
are
saying
is
this.
that
you
cannot
decide
to
join
the
states
without
at
the
same
time
deciding
that
we
have
to
worry
now
about
upper
basin
problems
which
may
not
become
real
until
after
the
year
2000.
mr.
john
p.
frank
exactly,
your
honor.
we
are
saying
that
you
cannot
join
the
upper
basin
states
without
forcing
upon
us
remote
contingent
and
speculative
controversies.
we
have
no
present
controversies.
we
ask
nothing
whatsoever
of
the
upper
basin
states.
we
live
happily
together.
we
are
saying
in
essence
that
we
should
not
be
set
at
each
others
throats
to
quarrel
aimlessly.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
if
i
could
to
the
case
materials
which
are
applicable,
both
on
the
question
of
joinder
and
on
the
question
of
justiciability.
first
of
all
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
yes.
mr.
john
p.
frank
including
our
neighbor's
allocation,
yes.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
determination
only
that
we
are
entitled
to
this
much
of
the
lower
basin
water,
and
our
claim
is
carefully
within
the
amount
of
the
lower
basin
water.
is
that
responsive,
mr.
justice?
all
we
have
--
we
have
not
asked
for
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
whole
stream
or
anything
of
the
sort.
we
have
simply
said
that
as
congress
set
in
1931
had
adopted
section
4
(a)
as
our
contract
says
that
out
of
that
allotment,
which
is
the
lower
basin,
we
are
entitled
to
2,800,000
acre
feet
of
mainstream
water
and
a
1,000,000
gathered
from
other
sources
that
would
come
largely
from
the
field.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
we
know
--
in
the
first
place,
we
have
very
full
records
of
the
amount
of
actual
flow.
now,
the
--
the
question
of
how
many
years
you
take
for
study
purposes
will
affect
of
course
the
amount.
we
know
that
the
upper
basin
is
obligated
to
send
down
75,000,000
acre
feet
--
acre
feet
every
10
years,
and
our
claim
is
carefully
within
that
amount.
mr.
john
p.
frank
well,
it's
seven.
the
difference
is
this,
your
honor,
that
the
seven
and
a
half
in
effect
comes
down
and
the
other
millions,
we
must
pick
up
where
we
can
find
it.
in
order
words,
it
originates
in
the
lower
basin.
the
million
will
have
to
--
since
--
you
see,
california
contributes
no
water
to
the
colorado
system.
so
that
it
follows
that
whatever
water
we
get
beyond
the
seven
and
a
half
have
to
originate
for
all
practical
purposes
in
our
own
streams.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
4,400,000.
in
short,
the
allocation
here,
we
are
saying
that
california
should
get
the
4,400,000
which
the
limitation
act
allows
it.
that
nevada
should
get
the
300
which
is
contracted
for
and
which
is
allowed
to
us
--
to
it
under
the
proposed
4
(a)
compact
of
the
limitation
act
and
that
we
should
get
the
difference
which
is
the
2,000,000
acres.
mr.
john
p.
frank
this
will
determine
what
beneficial
consumptive
use
is
for
our
lower
basin
purposes,
but
the
upper
basin
has
already
decided
that
question.
they
happen
to
have
adopted
the
definition
which
is
the
one
that
we
aspired
to,
but
that's
immaterial.
the
fact
is
that
nothing
you
can
decide
here
will
affect
their
definition
because
they
have,
as
it
were,
changed
the
common
law
already
and
by
their
own
agreement
settled
upon
a
definition.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
problem
is
that
what
they
have
to
send
us
is
not
by
the
compact
defined
in
terms
of
consumptive
use
at
all.
it
is,
as
mr.
ely's
said,
wet
water.
there
are
two
separate
provisions
we
use
in
terms
of
consumptive
use,
but
we
get
the
delivery
as
in
terms
of
the
most
readily
measurable
commodity
in
the
water
world,
namely,
wet
water,
and
out
of
that,
75,000,000
has
to
come
down
every
10
years.
and
therefore,
the
definition
will
make
no
difference
in
that
respect.
in
short,
the
definition
does
not
apply
to
what
is
delivered.
it
can
apply
only
to
the
distribution
among
ourselves,
and
there,
it
will
be
of
great
importance.
and
the
upper
basin
has
already,
for
itself,
adopted
a
definition
satisfactory
to
it.
mr.
john
p.
frank
oh,
well,
your
honor,
it
shouldn't
be
at
all
and
if
i
said
anything
of
the
sort,
let
me
pick
up
your
second
question.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
no.
let
me
correct
that.
the
basis
of
the
nevada
--
our
position
as
to
nevada
is
this.
that
section
4
(a)
of
the
limitation
act
in
the
so-called
tri-state
compact
set
up
an
allowance
for
nevada
of
300,000.
there
was
a
long
history
behind
it.
senator
keith
pittman
got
the
300.
it
was
twice
what
they
were
actually
using
and
it's
i
think
twice
what
they're
using
now.
senator
pittman
was
very
effective.
in
addition
to
that,
they
have
a
contract
with
the
united
states,
and
their
contract
is
worth
300,000
acre
feet.
now,
since
all
of
their
water
necessarily
comes
under
the
contract,
we
contend
that
any
possible
claim
of
theirs
or
anything
beyond
that
would
present
no
controversy
at
all.
mr.
john
p.
frank
it
should
not.
that
is
exactly
what
we're
contending,
your
honor,
and
indeed,
the
fact
that
you
can
put
the
question
may
mean
that
i
misled
you
in
some
way.
we
are
saying
that
we
should
be
able
to
adopt
our
definitions
and
our
terms
without
reference
to
what
they
did,
and
similarly,
they
should
be
able
to
live
and
adopt
theirs
without
reference
of
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
they
will
not.
that
is
the
vital
point,
because
the
only
measure
of
the
water
that
comes
down
is
not
a
legal
definition.
it
is
an
actual
physical
measure.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
the
--
the
problem
is
this.
that
under
the
situation
as
it
exists
under
the
limitation
act,
under
which
we
sue,
we
are
asking
for
the
amount
over
the
4,400,000
which
california
has.
now,
there
is
a
tricky
question
here.
i
could
go
into
it
if
you
wish,
which
it
depends
and
which
affects
the
question
of
what
is
surplus,
because
california
gets
half
the
surplus.
then,
we
claim
that
a
certain
million
acre
feet
is
not
surplus,
and
therefore,
they're
not
entitled
to
half
of
it
and
they
claimed
that
they
are.
but
that
is
the
point
of
which
the
controversy
turns.
now,
that
controversy
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
not
at
all,
your
honor,
because
that
amount
of
the
surplus
is
the
amount
which
has
to
originate
in
the
lower
basin
and
which
is
used
in
the
lower
basin
anyhow.
now,
if
i
may
go
on
to
the
case
material
which
may
concern
you,
we
are
dealing
--
it
is
suggested
with
rules
19
and
20
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
i
would
like
a
little
later
to
come
back
to
the
question
of
whether
those
rules
really
apply
to
original
actions
in
this
court.
but
for
the
moment,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
discussion
that
they
do,
we
have
to
consider
first
the
question
of
indispensable
parties
that
the
upper
basin
states
are
indispensable,
of
course,
they
would
be
to
be
joined
but
nobody
including
california
contends
that
they
are.
second,
the
question
of
necessary
parties.
third,
the
question
of
proper
parties.
now,
the
leading
case
on
this
entire
subject
is
the
case
of
nebraska
against
wyoming
and
it
is
our
principle
reliance
here.
in
that
state,
the
basic
situation
was
this,
that
the
north
platte
river
rose
in
colorado,
flow
into
wyoming
and
on
into
nebraska.
the
action
was
brought
by
the
state
of
nebraska
against
wyoming
for
the
purpose
of
settling
certain
questions
as
between
themselves
and
wyoming
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
colorado
was
an
indispensable
party.
on
the
other
hand,
nebraska
took
the
view
that
they
were
at
most
proper
party.
this
court,
after
fully
considering
the
matter,
found
that
colorado
was
not
rendered
an
indispensable
party,
and
that
the
action
need
not
be
dismissed
and
in
fact
they
went
further
and
mr.
justice
robert
said
that
colorado
was
not
an
indispensable
party
or
unnecessary
party
because,
said
the
court,
"nebraska
asserts
no
wrongful
act
of
colorado
and
prays
no
relief
against
her."
now
that,
your
honors,
is
the
identical
situation
here.
no
one
asserts
any
wrongful
act
against
any
of
the
upper
basin
states
and
no
one
prays
for
any
relief
against
them.
after
that
happened,
wyoming
filed
an
answer.
and
in
his
answer,
it
specifically
asked
for
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
whole
stream,
and
in
addition
to
that,
it
specifically
alleged
that
there
were
present
threats
against
the
stream
by
colorado
then
in
existence,
which
made
it
impossible
to
allocate
the
water
of
the
lower
riparian
states
without
at
the
same
time
considering
the
upper.
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
this
court
then
joined.
now,
let
me
put
with
that
before
i
attempt
to
analyze
the
rule,
the
case
of
united
states
against
west
virginia,
because
that
case
was
decided
here
between
the
first
nebraska-wyoming
and
the
second
nebraska-wyoming
case.
these
--
these
were
separated
only
by
a
few
months.
in
united
states
against
west
virginia,
united
states
brought
an
action
against
the
state
of
west
virginia,
alleging
that
west
virginia
was
interfering
with
its
use
of
the
water
on
the
new
river.
and
how
was
west
virginia
doing
it?
it
was
licensing
private
companies
to
build
establishments
and
works
on
the
new
river.
and
this
claim
created
a
controversy
between
united
states
and
west
virginia.
and
this
court,
in
dismissing
the
action,
said
that
since
the
bill
in
a
suit,
i
quote
mr.
justice
stone,
“neither
asks
the
protection
nor
alleges
the
invasion
of
any
property
rights,
and
that
there
was
no
adequate
allegation
of
any
interference
by
west
virginia."
and
then,
it
went
on
to
say
something
which
fits
this
case
to
a
perfection.
it
said,
"a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
officials
of
two
governments
is
all
that
was
involved
and
this
court
does
not
exist
to
settle
such
differences
of
opinion."
now,
in
that
case,
west
virginia
had
actually
licensed
to
conflicting
uses.
i
think
putting
the
cases
together,
decided
all
of
them
within
a
few
months
of
each
other
that
we
get
basically
what
might
be
called
this
rule
that
where
an
upper
riparian
owner
or
state
is
interested
only
because
it's
there,
because
the
water
comes
from
there,
then
this
court
has
held
that
that's
not
reason
enough
to
join
it.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
that
reaches
what
is
to
us
the
most
compelling
matter
of
all.
indeed,
mr.
justice
douglas,
you
may
recall
that
in
the
final,
there
was
a
third
opinion
on
this
subject
at
the
late
stage.
and
in
that
stage,
colorado
again
raised
the
question
of
whether
it
might
be
eliminated
from
the
suit
and
the
opinion
said,
"no
stressing
that
there
was
no
compact."
now,
we
are
contending
that
the
principles
of
that
case
would
be
binding
if
there
were
no
compact
here
that
we
would
be
bound
by
the
first
nebraska-wyoming
decision.
but
our
a
fortiori,
we
are
particularly
bound
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
states
have
done
their
dead
level
best
to
settle
these
questions
for
themselves
by
compact
and
not
merely
by
one
compact
but
by
two,
and
where
the
upper
basin
states
are
very
carefully
by
compact,
settled
the
questions
which
are
here.
we
think
that
our
situation
is
even
stronger
than
the
cases
which
are
there.
let
me
turn
to
the
problem
of
justiciability
which
is
here,
because
that
was
the
fundamental
matter
on
which
the
master's
decision
rested.
the
basic
principles
which
this
court
has
laid
down
as
to
interstate
litigation,
themselves
are
at
the
root
of
the
justiciability
problem
and
i
would
like
first
to
enumerate
those.
you've
held
in
the
first
place
that
you
will
not
take
jurisdiction
between
states
and
i
quote,
"in
the
absence
of
absolute
necessity."
you
have
held
second
that
you
will
not
take
jurisdiction
and
i
again
quote,
"unless
the
threatened
injury
is
clearly
shown
to
be
of
serious
magnitude
and
eminent."
and
finally,
you
have
held
that
you
prefer
solutions
by
a
compact
to
solutions
by
litigation.
now,
those
principles
weighed
very
heavily
with
the
master,
because
he
felt
that
in
deciding
whether
he
should
force
the
other
states
into
the
litigation,
he
must
consider
whether
there
was
really
any
absolute
necessity
or
any
pressing
an
eminent
danger
which
would
warrant
it
and
he
decided
very
clearly
that
there
was
not.
the
absolute
necessity
test
itself,
if
it
does
apply
fully
to
join
their
parties,
i
think
means
this.
that
absolute
necessity
is
a
term
which
can
only
apply
to
indispensable
parties.
indispensable
parties
who
are
--
are
those
who
are
absolutely
necessary.
if
this
court
really
means
to
adhere
to
the
full
meaning
of
what
was
said
in
the
alabama
against
arizona
case,
if
you
mean
to
apply
a
rule
of
absolute
necessity,
then
i
take
it
you
are
deciding
that
you
will
not
join
states
against
their
will
unless
they
are
indispensable.
and
so
said,
it's
conceded
by
everyone
here
that
these
upper
basin
states
are
not
indispensable.
we
therefore
follow
that
the
whole
matter
is
done.
however,
on
the
problem
of
justiciability,
you
have
held
that
interstate
litigation
requires
a
case
in
controversy
just
as
any
other
litigation
would
do.
and
as
to
that,
we
have
two
california
contentions.
they
are
these.
first,
california
contends
that
the
case
to
our
controversy
rule
does
not
apply
to
the
joinder
of
parties.
their
position
and
i
quote
from
their
brief
is
that
"once
there
is
a
controversy
between
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant,
"there
is
no
further
justiciability
problem
to
consider
on
the
joinder
motion."
now,
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
this
cannot
be
true
that
the
doctrine
of
case
in
controversy
applies
to
all
of
the
parties
in
the
case.
i
could
pick
no
more
familiar
example,
and
for
example,
the
case
of
united
public
workers
against
mitchell,
a
case
in
which
there
were
12
plaintiffs
and
this
court
with
great
care
went
over
all
of
them.
and
finally,
for
variant
reasons,
struck
11
because
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
and
then
proceeded
to
decide
the
case
as
to
the
12.
now,
those
principles,
i
think,
are
fully
applicable
here,
and
indeed,
i
pass
the
matter
without
further
consideration
because
i
cannot
suppose
that
there
is
any
very
serious
doubt,
but
that
the
case
in
controversy,
principle
does
apply
to
the
joinder
of
parties
and
to
the
additional
party
just
as
much
as
it
applies
to
the
bringing
the
suit
in
the
first
instance.
we
then
reach
the
contention
which
is
the
alternative
california
contention,
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
here.
and
as
to
that,
california
takes
this
position.
they
say
and
let
me
quote
from
their
brief,
"despite
the
absence
of
a
present
breach
of
obligation,
and
despite
the
absence
of
a
present
physical
invasion
of
a
claimed
right,
california
concludes
that
a
quiet
title
suit
by
arizona"
and
i'm
still
quoting
"against
the
absent
states
alleging
the
identical
title
here
asserted,
would
state
a
justiciable
controversy
within
the
constitutional
power
of
this
court
to
decide."
in
short,
california
says,
first,
that
they
don't
need
to
have
a
case
or
controversy,
second,
that
if
one
is
needed
that
if
a
quiet
title,
please
notice
they
have,
that
if
we
had
brought,
acquired
a
title
action
against
the
upper
basin
states,
it
would
lie
despite
the
absence
of
any
present
breach
of
obligation
and
there
is
none
and
despite
the
absence
of
a
present
physical
invasion
complaining
the
rights."
now,
your
honors,
we
contend
that
that
proposition
is
categorically
wrong,
and
we
of
arizona,
we
got
to
say
are
singularly
well
informed
on
this
subject
because
we've
been
through
it
before.
in
the
first
of
our
arizona
against
california
cases,
way
back
in
1930,
we
did
bring
an
action
in
which
all
of
the
states
were
joined
and
in
which
the
united
states
was,
as
i
recall
it,
also
involved,
alleging
that
the
activities
which
were
then
going
on
in
respect
to
the
colorado
interfered
with
our
rights
in
the
river
and
this
court
held,
this
court
held
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
and
i
quote,
"that
this
contention
cannot
prevail
because
it
is
based
not
on
any
actual
or
threatened
impairment
of
arizona's
rights,
but
upon
an
assumed
potential
invasion."
now,
there,
your
honors,
we
think
we
come
to
the
core
up
and
this
is
what
persuaded
the
master,
but
an
action
of
this
sort
will
not
lie.
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
on
the
basis
of
a
merely
assumed
potential
invasion.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
controversy
which
we
have
with
the
upper
basin
states
which
is
likely
to
come
into
an
actually
existing
present
controversy
within
the
lifetime
even
of
the
youngest
page
behind
that
bench.
under
those
circumstances,
there
is
no
actual
threat,
and
in
all
of
the
cases,
this
court
has
acquired
that
there
be
some
kind
of
actual
present
threat
before
even
acquired
title
action
will
lie.
and
finally,
the
whole
argument
is
suppositious
because
it
began
as
i
said
with
an
“if”.
if
we
had
brought
such
an
action,
it
would
lie.
the
answer
is
that
we
didn't
bring
such
an
action.
we
didn't
bring
such
an
action
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
that
is
true
that
in
the
past
cases,
we
had
sued
all
the
upper
basin
states.
but
those
were
cases
before
we
were
under
the
compact
and
now
we're
under
the
compact
which
puts
us
into
a
division.
and
now,
we
must
live
with
it,
and
do
our
litigating
with
the
only
persons
with
whom
we
have
any
controversy
and
those
are
our
immediate
neighbors.
let
me
add
a
word
in
conclusion.
as
to
the
act
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
there,
your
honor,
what
we
mean
is
this.
that
the
basic
controversy
which
we
have
with
california
is
a
controversy
of
how
the
water
which
is
allocated
to
the
lower
basin
should
be
measured.
the
problem
is
essentially
this,
that
california
takes
the
water
from
a
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
your
honor,
not
--
not
in
the
slightest
degree.
i
would
like
to
amplify
on
it
if
i
could.
the
california
takes
all
of
its
water
out
of
the
basin
altogether.
it
goes
either
to
this
area
which
is
then
drains
under
the
salt
and
seas
so
that
none
of
it
comes
back,
or
else,
it
goes
over
to
los
angeles
where
obviously
none
of
it
comes
back.
our
situation
is
different.
in
this
area,
in
the
center
of
the
state,
which
is
at
the
moment
so
badly
depleted
that
our
well,
100,
200,
and
300
feet
below
--
are
below
the
ground.
in
this
area
and
throughout
our
system,
we
take
water
out
and
we
put
it
back
again.
it
drains
back
in.
the
same
water
is
used
many
times,
whereas
over
here,
the
water
is
used
once
and
thrown
away
over
here
and
we
may
use
it
three
and
four
times
we.
and
we
are
contending
and
that
--
what
that
plea
applies
to
it.
it's
our
contention
that
these
multiple
uses
by
us
as
a
result
of
our
many
dams
should
not
be
counted
against
this
in
the
aggregate,
but
rather,
only
but
actually
comes
out
with
that
question.
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
that's
all
--
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that's
right
and
we
said
that
it
should
not
be
counted
against
us
before
we
--
because
we
have
the
multiple
uses
and
that
is
all
that
clause
relates
to.
it
has
no
bearing
at
all
on
the
water
which
actually
passes
lee's
ferry.
i
have
said
that
i
wanted
to
--
sorry.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
the
one
--
i
think
serious
problem
here
is
the
one
you
put
your
finger
on,
the
mexican
problem.
it
is
conceivable
that
someday
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
but
we
do
contend
that
that
is
--
that's
not
--
that
is
not
this
century's
problem.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
two-fold.
that
in
the
first
place,
the
upper
gate
--
upper
division
has
an
absolute
obligation
to
let
75,000,000
acre
feet
come
down.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no
matter
what
it
has
in
the
course
of
its
10
years.
that
is
the
one
irrevocable
commitment.
mr.
john
p.
frank
if
the
day
comes
when
it
doesn't
have
it,
it
will
feel
a
pinch.
mr.
john
p.
frank
oh,
your
honor,
please
understand
that
this
is
over
a
10-year
period.
it
averages
out
that
the
states
took
good
care
of
themselves.
but
your
honor,
this
is
an
equitable
action
and
you
presumably
will
always
have
the
right
to
do
whatever
it
has
to
be
done
if
in
some
distant
future,
some
radically
different
situation
exists
than
like
any
other
equitable
decree,
it
can
presumably
be
reopened
and
if
need
be
reconsidered.
all
we're
contending
is
that's
sufficient
to
the
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
that
question
is
going
to
be,
perhaps
someday,
a
difficult
one.
all
we're
saying
is
that
it
cannot
possibly
be
anticipated.
it
will
depend
--
let
me
give
just
one
illustration.
the
population
of
my
state
has
almost
doubled
in
the
last
10
years.
who
can
tell
what
the
distribution
is
going
to
be
in
the
course
of
a
30
or
40
years
which
you
are
now
supposing?
all
of
those
things
which
are
questions,
we
should
not
only
--
should
not
be
considered
now
but
could
not
be
wisely
considered
now.
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
your
honor,
we
would
answer
that
question
in
the
negative
for
the
same
reason
that
it
was
answered
in
the
negative
in
the
first
nebraska-wyoming
case,
namely,
that
what
you
are
asking
there
is
--
is
the
fact
that
the
water
comes
from
another
place
sufficient
by
itself
to
create
an
interest
which
requires
the
joinder
of
all
parties.
and
we
say
merely
that
this
court
has
decided
that
question.
it
might
have
decided
it
either
way.
it
has
decided
it
in
a
negative
and
we
think
decided
it
right
that
the
rule
of
an
actual
present
threat
is
a
sound
rule
and
that
is
should
be
adhered
to.
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
there
your
honor
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
there,
your
honor,
we
contend
merely
that
it
cannot
wisely
be
done
now,
that
it
would
require
such
supposing
and
such
wondering
about
event
so
long
in
the
future
that
all
you
could
do
would
be
to
take
a
step
at
something
that
you
would
be
almost
certain
to
get
wrong.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
it
may
someday
be
necessary
in
some
future
action
perhaps
to
reduce
to
a
percentage
basis,
but
we
cannot
believe
that
you
would
be
tempted
at
the
moment
under
all
existing
conditions
to
rewrite
the
limitation
act
as
it
exists
and
the
entire
system,
all
of
which
is
based
on
an
actual
measure.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
practical
difference
is
this.
that
if
you
were
to
decide,
if
you
were
eventually
on
the
merits
to
decide
that
our
water
should
be
distributed
on
a
percentage
basis,
you
could
do
that
even
then
on
the
basis
simply
of
the
lower
basin.
that
is
you
could
say
that
instead
of
our
getting
2,800,000
acre
feet
out
of
7.5
that
we
get
whatever
that
percentage
is
out
of
the
water
available
to
us.
that
is
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
well,
let
me
address
my
comment
only
to
the
question
of
joinder
if
--
if
i
may.
so,
all
i'm
saying
there
is
that
if
you
were
to
adopt
such
a
position,
and
in
these
cases,
frequently,
percentages
have
to
be
adopted,
you
would
still
be
making
such
a
determination
only
as
to
the
lower
basin
and
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
involve
the
upper
basin
at
the
same
time.
mr.
john
p.
frank
if
it
were
on
a
percentage
basis
amongst
ourselves.
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
think
that
is
true
if
i
understand
you.
let
me
say
this,
this
last
word
on
the
practical
consequences.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
fully
perceive
the
purport
of
your
--
your
question
but
as
i
understand
it
at
least
i
would
say
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
what
we
are
saying,
i
hope
an
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
since
that
all
that
is
now
before
us
is
the
joinder
problem,
that
the
question
of
whether
we
should
operate
on
a
percentage
or
on
some
other
basis,
is
not
a
good
enough
reason
for
example
for
making
the
state
of
wyoming
get
into
the
litigation.
mr.
john
p.
frank
and
because
it
could
only
come
to
pass
by
virtue
of
circumstances
which
we
cannot
now
foresee
which
would
then
affect
your
judgment.
mr.
john
p.
frank
you
mean
--
now,
let
me
get
clear,
mr.
justice.
are
you
speaking
of
a
percentage
division
amongst
ourselves?
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
i
am
sorry
that
i
did
not
see
the
force
of
that
earlier.
simply,
by
one
of
a
comprehension,
yes,
that
is
exactly
what
is
done
in
all
of
these
water
cases.
that
is
to
say,
normally,
there
are
claims
of
too
much.
there
is
a
distribution
and
then
in
the
weak
years,
there
must
necessarily
be
a
percentage
allocation
or
cutback,
and
that
may
someday
be
necessary
here.
the
multiple
dams
make
it
less
likely
here
than
in
perhaps
some
other
areas,
but
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
exactly.
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
it
is
to
that
point
that
i
would
like
to
address
my
concluding
remarks.
and
that
is
the
question
of
what
the
relation
of
all
this
is
to
the
future
of
my
statement.
we
deal
with
this
situation
that
ours
is
the
one
state
which
is
entirely
in
the
basin
of
the
colorado.
this
is
the
only
water
source
that
we
have.
the
problems
of
all
of
the
other
states
can
be
solved
by
limitless
ingenuity
or
by
the
vast
expenditure
of
money,
as
for
example,
by
taking
salt
out
of
seawater
or
by
taking
one
of
the
great
streams
of
northern
california
and
deflecting
it
to
the
south.
we
have
no
such
possibilities.
our
state,
mr.
justice,
is
one
of
the
fastest
growing
states
in
the
union.
great
numbers
of
people
have
come
to
us
to
enjoy
our
time,
and
all
the
other
benefits
of
life
in
arizona.
now,
we
are
not
asking
you
to
underwrite
the
migration
which
has
come
to
us.
we
do
say
that
our
present
situation
as
such
that
we
are
simply
desperate
for
water.
we
are
taking
land
out
of
production
because
we
haven't
the
water
port
because
we've
used
up
our
total
ground
supply.
we
are
saying
to
you
that
it
is
unfair
and
unwise
and
unjust
in
against
every
principle
which
ought
to
guide
the
considerations
of
discretion
to
allow
delaying
factors
to
creep
into
this
litigation
to
let
more
people
come
to
us
and
may
one
day
have
to
be
sent
away
again.
the
addition
of
the
upper
basin
states
can
only
have
two
practical
consequences
so
far
as
we
are
concerned.
one
of
them
is
to
delay
this
litigation
for
another
year
or
so
on
maneuvers
and
motions
from
pleadings
fill
the
air.
and
the
other
is
to
involve
us
in
almost
aimless
disputes
with
our
upper
basin
neighbors
of
whom
we
get
on
half
of
it.we
say
that
if
you
have
discretion,
it
should
be
exercised
to
avoid
those
consequences.
thank
you.
