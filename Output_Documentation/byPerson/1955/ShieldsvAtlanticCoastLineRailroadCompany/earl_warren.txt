is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
shows
what
are
most
of
the
dome
cars
of
this
kind
do
have
such
running
boards?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
meant
this
particular
kind
of
a
car.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
wasn't
i
quite
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shepard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
true
that
the
board
was
so
rotten
that
it
would
crumble
this
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
caused
it
to
break?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wasn't
overloading
by
two
people
that
caused
it
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
true
that
the
railroad
company
itself
has,
on
many
cases,
many
instances
in
connection
with
this
case
referred
to
this
in
the
ordinary
course
of
businesses
or
running
boards?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
the
superintendents
of
the
railroad?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why,
because
it
is
a
running
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said,
would
you
--
would
you
collapse
because
it
is
a
running
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
describe
the
board
please?
could
you
walk
on
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
the
yardmaster
of
25
years
experience
that
testified
that
it
was
used
in
the
operation
of
the
car
that
occasionally
--
occasionally
they
went
up
there,
stood
on
--
on
that
to
fix
the
dome
cap
or
other
similar
things.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
they
go
beyond
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
would
he
--
how
would
he
get
up
to
the
dome?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i'm
talking
about
this
testimony
of
your
yardmaster.
you
said
that,
he
had
--
he
had
seen
workmen
go
up
there
during
the
movement
of
a
train
to
--
to
make
secure
this
dome
cap.
how
would
he
be
gotten
up
there
if
it
hadn't
been
for
this
--
this
ladder
and
this
thing
was
commonly
called
a
running
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
other
way
for
him
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then,
is
this
a
safety
device?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
during
the
movement
of
the
train,
the
dome
cap
did
become
loose
and
started
to
--
started
to
come
off
and
you're
losing
some
of
your
oil.
what
would
you
expect
the
employee
--
train
employees
to
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
expect
them
to
fix
--
make
that
fast?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
let's
take
something
else
it
might
happen
up
there
to
cause
the
same
condition
but
how
would
he
get
up
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
call
that
a
safety
device
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
fact
that
the
railroad
company
put
that
there,
some
evidence
that
there
was
a
safety
factor
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
whom?
