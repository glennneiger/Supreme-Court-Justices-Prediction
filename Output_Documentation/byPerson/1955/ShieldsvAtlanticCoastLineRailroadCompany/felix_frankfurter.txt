justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
--
it
is
the
compulsory
under
the
statute
to
provide
the
board
in
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
standardizing
applies
to
--
you'd
have
to
have
the
same
kind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
exclude
that
you
have
to
have
some
kind.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
it
necessary
to
have
this
kind
of
a
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
although
the
statute
doesn't
require
it
and
they
need
not
have
had
it,
never
let
the
state
do
have
it
and
something
happens
there
with
absent
liability,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
--
that's
why
i
ask
you
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let's
see
if
i
understand
you.
i
understood
your
answer
even
my
question
wasn't
clear.
my
question
was
whether
this
type
of
running
board,
not
--
not
the
standardized
one
of
the
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
kind
of
things
is
required
by
safety
appliance
act.
your
answer
is
no,
as
i
understood
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that's
another
question
although
--
but
they
need
not
have
had
this
or
any
other
kind
of
a
running
board
of
this
kind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
very
car,
just
as
it
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
they
had
had
enough,
could
you
be
sued
under
the
safety
appliance
act
for
disobedience
of
that
act
without
not
having
this
particular
safety
appliance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i'm
right
--
if
i
look
at
the
brief
filed
by
the
i.c.c,
do
i
incur
correctly
from
that
that
it
is
their
view
that
this
running
board
was
not
a
required
safety
appliance
by
the
safety
appliance
act,
is
that
what
they
suggested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
ways
of
mind
could
have
catch
with
this
submission
by
the
i.c.c.
do
that
construction
of
safety
appliance
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
you
--
you
say
--
you
don't
say
it
was
in
it.
you
said,
that
--
we
have
to
look
for
the
particular
circumstance
and
the
particular
car
to
decide
whether
this
particular
kind
of
cause
of
requirement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
your
answer
--
then
i
suggest
you
should
say
--
then
i
ask
you
whether
this
is
a
required
--
first
required
by
the
act,
your
answer
is
yes
and
then
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
are
not
here
to
--
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
have
all
the
access
of
having
it
happen
or
had
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
the
commission
permitted
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
instead
of
--
isn't
the
brief
on
behalf
of
the
commission
--
the
commission
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
--
i'm
not
--
i
found
out
the
question
what
we
can
carry.
but
the
commission
speaks
fully
to
have
authorized
general
counsel,
does
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
this
brief,
an
expression
of
the
factors
in
the
view
of
the
commission
charged
with
the
duty
of
enforcing
this
act.
this
isn't
an
individual
view
from
a
lawyer
who
filed
a
brief.
this
was
asked
by
commission
to
express
its
views
on
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
been
its
practice.
it
doesn't
rest
merely
in
the
form
of
like
hearing,
this
question
of
a
--
of
a
party
that
is
charged
within
enforcement
and
presumably,
they
had
the
material
before
them
and
to
justify
them
in
making
this
statement
or
roughly
and
certainly
don't
know
can
be
legal
to
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
(voice
overlap),
in
this
case,
a
special
verdict
had
been
asked
from
the
jury,
this
case
wouldn't
be
here,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
our
special
verdict
allows
into
the
--
the
district
court
in
alabama?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
federal
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
go
on
two
counts,
one
based
on
negligence,
the
other
enacted
by
(inaudible),
to
use
the
shorthand.
i
should
think
the
(inaudible)
if
you
ask
the
jury
to
answer
each
one
of
the
claims.
that
doesn't
make
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
move
on?
is
that
with
the
shipper,
there's
one
statement
that
left
me
a
little
doubt
when
you
emphasized
the
fact
that
power
station
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
loading
and
unloading?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
world
are
required
for
safety
appliance
for
which,
in
connection
with
which
there's
absolute
liability,
lots
of
this
controversy
is
the
problem
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
not
whether
the
railroad
have
some
responsibility
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
whether
these
responsibilities
followed
them
for
negligence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
assuming
it
is
safety
appliance,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
from
the
car
station,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
don't
understand
why
you
have
decided
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
safety
appliance
act
--
did
the
safety
appliance
act
qualify
the
limited
or
restricted
to
the
basis
of
recovery
by
people
in
the
same
relation
to
the
railroad
as
to
the
liability
of
the
railroad
under
federal
employers
liability
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
must
come
in
that
the
requirement
of
being
an
employee
engaged
in
the
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
but
the
plaintiff
can
sue
for
the
safety
appliance
act.
is
it
your
view
--
must
be
in
the
same
relation
to
the
railroad
that
an
employee
under
federal
employers
liability
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
passengers
can't
do
under
safety
appliance
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
virtue
of
the
--
by
reason
of
negligence
or
as
such
without
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
--
that
is
negligence
(voice
overlap)
--
