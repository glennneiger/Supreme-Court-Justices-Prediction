where
has
the
commission
said
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
the
commission
said
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
rule
of
the
commission
or
have
they
ruled
on
it
in
anyway?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
assume
myself
it's
because
the
counsel
makes
the
legal
argument
and
that
represents
the
view
of
the
commission
or
in
any
actual
functioning
of
the
commission
in
deciding
a
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
someone
else
lied,
i
do
not.
and
i
was
asking
if
the
commission
itself
has
held
that
any
time
passed
on
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
it
doesn't
read
on
legal
argument
by
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
had
look
at
it
and
discovered
that
this
was
rotten,
do
you
mean
that
you
would
have
to
take
that
car?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
--
did
the
i.c.c.
required
railroads
to
take
cars
with
rotten
things
like
that
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
therefore
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
it
is,
i
understand
your
argument
that
it's
not,
assuming
that
it
is
a
running
board
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
what
it
is.
is
it
your
belief
that
congress
--
that
the
board
about
describing
some
boards
--
running
boards
at
other
place
and
deprive
people
of
the
benefits
of
section
11
which
requires
running
board,
it
was
required
to
be
secured.
is
it
your
idea
that
the
i.c.c.
and
by
resolution
or
brief
or
anything
here
relieve
the
railroads
from
certain
duty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
requiring
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
mean
the
i.c.c.?
does
it
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
i.c.c.
requires
to
have
running
board,
suppose
the
company
requires
running
boards,
could
the
i.c.c.,
by
its
ipse
dixit,
relieve
the
company
from
liability
for
running
boards
which
it
dismissed
required
to
be
put
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
question,
i
know
whether
it's
a
running
board.
i
can
understand
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
the
business
requires
it
and
it's
a
running
board
is
secured
here
that
because
the
i.c.c.
chooses
not
to
standardize
it
at
that
place,
that
it
can
thereby
leave
section
11
which
requires
running
boards,
it
requires
to
be
secured
that
the
i.c.c.
can
by
its
failure
to
standardize
this
particular
one
or
relieve
the
burden
which
the
laws
puts
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
i
decided
it
didn't
need
any.
that's
possible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
anywhere
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
they
decided
it
didn't
need
anywhere.
that's
also
possible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
they
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
did,
would
that
relieve
them
--
the
railroad
from
the
safety
appliance
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
must
have
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
word
--
the
word
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
require,
that
would
seem
to
me
in
the
reply
brief
in
the
section
11
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
apply
what's
in
the
section
12,
i
would
suppose
that
a
--
many
things
maybe
required
for
the
operations
of
the
railroad
that
the
i.c.c.
doesn't
standardized
require
it
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
this
is
a
running
board,
it's
a
running
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it
is
not.
that's
--
i
understand
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
idea
is
that
only
running
board,
which
all
running
--
actual
running
board
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
to
be
secured
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
i.c.c.
says
it
have
to
be
secure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
avail
that
the
two
cases,
have
we
not,
that
the
safety
appliance
act
was
the
benefit
of
the
employees,
and
the
public
and
either
one
can
be
sued.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
united
states
against
california,
coray
against
southern
pacific
company?
