mr.
norman
c.
shepard
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
thank
you,
sir.
the
district
judge
on
the
contrary
told
the
jury
that
they
need
to
make
no
finding
as
to
that
answer
of
the
term
in
general
verdict
and
need
not
to
say
which
count
is
a
basic
point.
now,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
plaintiff
of
the
course
still
has,
under
the
circuit
court
decision,
the
right
to
go
back
and
get
a
trial
on
the
count
of
common
law
negligence.
as
to
the
safety
appliance
act,
we
say,
in
our
brief
two
things.
we
say
it
first
that
the
act
does
not
require
this
board
and
we
also
say
that
the
safety
appliance
act
is
not
available
to
this
petitioner.
it
appears
in
the
brief
and
i
have
to
call
attention
to
it,
the
reply
brief
especially
the
statement
is
in
there,
inadvertently,
i'm
sure.
on
page
12,
that
it
is
undisputed
that
its
effective
car
was
then
used
on
respondent's
line
at
the
time
of
the
injury.
we
respectfully
dispute
that.
the
entire
record
shows
this
car
had
been
delivered
on
a
private
chauffeur
to
an
industry
and
totally
disconnected
from
the
line
of
the
railroad
and
was
sitting
there
in
their
control
and
in
their
possession.
this
man
was
an
independent
contractor.
he
testified
that
he
worked
at
filling
stations
on
such
things
as
gasoline
pumps
and
he
was
available
to
these
people.
incidentally,
the
record
will
also
show
on
page
122,
the
witness,
watkins,
who
was
the
helper
of
the
plaintiff,
testified
that
the
petitioner
first
went
upon
the
running
board
and
made
some
adjustments
and
connections.
then
he
came
down
to
make
the
holes
or
fixed
the
holes
at
the
bottom
and
return
to
the
running
board
having
to
send
his
helper
up
because
he
was
only
showing
his
helper
how
this
thing
was
done.
and
it
was
not
until
both
of
them
at
their
weight
upon
this
dome
step
board
that
it
broke.
it
doesn't
necessarily
affect
the
legal
problem
confronting
the
court
but
the
petitioner
passed
over
this
board
twice
that
are
levered.
and
of
course,
so
does
his
helper
and
there
was
no
apparent
defect.
it
is
true
that
it
broke.
now,
i
might
say
to
further
to
please
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
fragments
of
it,
sir.
there
was
a
knot
hole
or
a
knot
in
it.
and
around
that
knot,
there
--
there
were
crumble
fragments.
yes,
that
it
supported
the
weight
of
the
petitioner
on
his
first
trip
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
the
defective
condition
of
the
board.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes
sir.
it
--
it
had
a
rotten
place
on
it.
no
--
no
dispute
about
that
under
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
well,
if
--
if
it
hadn't
have
the
rotten
place,
i
take
it
that
the
two
of
them
might
have
been
able
to
stand
upon
it.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
board
or
whatever
name
we
call
it
isn't
a
running
board
because
it
doesn't
run
anywhere,
it's
a
short
board
about
six
feet.
no
one
can
run
on
it,
nor
does
it
run
from
any
place
to
another.
many
of
the
old
cars
do
not
have
a
dome
step
board
at
all.
some
industry
provide
a
scaffolding
with
a
--
a
flat
form
themselves
into
which
these
cars
are
--
are
by
--
are
by
the
side
of
the
truck
where
these
cars
are
placed
and
their
employees
or
their
independent
contractor
use
their
own
facilities.
there's
no
requirement
whatever
by
the
i.c.c.
or
the
act
of
congress
to
make
any
convenience
or
device
for
those
who
unload
the
cars.
loading
and
unloading
devices
are
not
covered
anywhere
in
the
act.
now,
as
to
whether
there
has
been
a
decision
or
not,
this
act
has
been
affected,
i
think,
since
1910.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
it
is
in
the
record
that
some
of
the
witnesses
so
testified,
but
i
might
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
acted
easily
have
been
by
inadvertence,
and
then
interrogatories,
for
instance,
the
profound
--
the
question
might
distinguish
adversary
use
the
expressions
on
15
or
16
times
and
thereby
getting
the
witness
to
use
it
for
some
seven
times,
i
believe
he
said.
but
in
his
reply
brief,
he
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes.
i
believe
it
was,
yes,
sir.
it
was
referred
to
as
a
dome
step
running
board.
but
in
his
reply
brief,
he
admits
our
contention
about
that
and
on
page
2
he
says,
the
witness
is
for
the
respondent
and
i
have
respondent's
counsel.
well,
that's
into
referring
to
it
as
a
running
board
which,
of
course,
i'm
very
liable
to
do
myself.
now,
if
the
court
pleases
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
sir?
[laughter]
inadvertently,
sir.
and
i
confess
it's
my
first
"i'm
somewhat
nervous."
i
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
might
thought
of
that.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no,
sir.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
conceivably
be
because
it
runs
so
well
and
no
one
can
run
upon
it.
but
i
think
it's
just
a
--
a
manner
of
speed
or
expression
but
as
the
circuit
court
said,
there
is
nothing
in
the
i.c.c.
regulation
by
whatever
name
called
that
requires
this
board
at
the
dome.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
in
a
very
limited
distance,
sir.
it
is
six
feet
in
length.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
it
has
no
connection
at
either
end.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
there
is
a
short
ladder
up
to
the
handrail
so
that
the
industry
can
use.
that
is
not
for
railroad
employees
or
ladders
for
railroad
employees
toward
the
ends
of
the
car
which
they
use
to
get
up
to
the
top
of
the
adjoining
car
or
to
fix
the
brakes.
and
this
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
he
said
that,
sir,
but
there
--
but
he
says
it
this
way,
“i
have
seen
you.”
some
say
it
was
accustomed
or
that
it
was
a
habit
or
that
they
did
it.
but
what
we
--
what
he
is
talking
about
there,
of
course,
is
a
--
a
car
in
train
movement
and
some
employee
thinking
it's
more
convenient
to
go
that
way,
he
might
have
done
so.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
toward
the
end
sir.
the
ladder
was
on
the
end
that
are
required.
this
--
this
thing
is
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
well,
we
--
we
don't
understand
he
hasn't
any
duty
in
connection
with
the
dome,
sir.
not
any.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
well,
sir,
if
the
car
was
standing
still,
he
could
have
done
so
by
going
up
to
the
end
walking
across,
but
it
was
in
movement,
there
was
no
other
way
for
him
to
do
it.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no,
sir.
if
it
was
in
--
in
facts
and
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no,
sir.
it's
a
loading
device,
an
unloading
device.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
if
your
honor
please,
it
could
not
lose
the
oil
because
they
--
they
don't
merely
fix
it
over
to
the
valve
under
the
dome
that
has
to
be
turned
and
that
is
why
this
man
was
up
there.
the
dome
coming
off
would
not
lose
any
oil.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
if
the
train
was
in
motion,
sir,
it
would
be
very
dangerous
for
him
to
go
any
other
way.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
but
assuming
however
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no,
sir,
because
the
same
thing
could
have
happened
on
the
many
cars
that
roll
on
the
railroads
that
have
no
dome
step
board
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
we
don't
have
any
at
all.
and
many
of
them
do
not
and
none
of
them
are
required.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
well,
sir,
i
don't
know,
sir,
but
the
railroad
company
didn't
put
that
there.
these
tank
cars
are
built
by
--
by
shippers.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
for
the
use
of
the
people
in
the
petroleum
industry
and
they
are
leased
and
are
rented.
and
we
haul
them
for
a
charge.
we
could
not
decline
to
take
this
car
because
it
complied
with
the
i.c.c.
regulations.
we
could
not
introduce
it
and
in
45
years,
we
haven't
been
able
to
refuse
one
that
had
it
or
didn't
have
it.
there
are
several
different
types
of
these
platforms.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
i
think
we
would
have
or
we
could
have
--
have
that
board
repaired
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
but
that
goes
to
the
common
law
account
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
i
believe
they
could
have
made
an
exception
to
it.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
i
think
we
could
have
made
an
exception
to
it,
but
not
because
it
was
a
safety
appliance.
if
--
if
a
door
had
been
swinging,
a
door
to
a
box
car
we
could
have
taken
the
exception
to
it
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
but
not
because
it
was
a
safety
appliance.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
i
would
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
very
language,
i
think
it
is
significant
that
the
language
of
section
11
says,
all
cars
must
be
equipped
or
secures
to
the
old
(inaudible)
and
efficient
handbrakes.
and
then
next
it
says,
cars
requiring
secure
ladders
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
it
means
that
the
i.c.c.
shall
require.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
because
it's
turned
the
administration
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
the
business
of
operating
the
railroad,
may
it
please
the
court,
or
had
in
the
car
did
not
require
it
to
be
put
there.
this
was
built,
as
i
say,
by
a
shipper.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes.
these
--
these
cars
are
built
by
shippers
and
they
have
various
designs.
some
of
them
have
a
circle
to
walk
way
around
the
dome.
some
have
boards
on
each
side
of
the
dome.
some
have
supporting
rails.
some
have
nothing
at
all.
and
--
and
not
only
do
we
say
that
they
haven't
been
standardized,
we
say
it
hasn't
been
required
and
that
there's
been
a
determination
by
the
administrative
agency
charge
with
this
responsibility
for
a
period
of
45
years
that
not
all
are
required.
a
continuous
running
board
around
the
car
is
required
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
not
this
dome
step
board.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
i've
taken
that
the
i.c.c.
has
control
of
the
administration
of
this
act
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
and
that
congress
said
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
have
so
decided.
they
don't
need
this
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
this
dome
step
board.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
of
course
it's
possible,
sir.
but
of
course
they
have
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
made
many
decisions
through
the
years
as
to
what
they
do
require.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no,
sir.
because
it
says
it
must
have
some
running
boards.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
but
where
they
shall
be
and
the
kind
they
shall
be
and
what
kind
and
--
and
location
shall
be
required
is
up
to
the
commission
and
upon
that
subject
they
have
spoke.
they
have
said
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
they
shall
be
one
continuously.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
that
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
well,
of
course
that
is
for
the
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
that's
part
of
the
--
part
of
the
ground
that
we're
on
and
we
say,
if
it
is
a
running
board
sir,
it
still
is
not
a
safety
appliance
because
the
i.c.c.
has
never
said
to
put
one
there.
they
said
put
it
around
here.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
that
is
correct,
sir.
except,
of
course,
we
still
have
our
common
law
negligence
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
--
which
remains
to
be
tried.
now,
upon
that
face
of
the
matter
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
because
sir,
he
insist
that
its
in
train
line
service.
i
emphasize
it
because
we
contend
that
this
plaintiff,
or
cannot
bring
to
his
aid,
the
safety
appliance
act
even
if
it's
required,
even
if
it's
a
running
board.
because
he
wasn't
engaged
in
any
type
of
interstate
commerce,
did
not
work
for
any
railroad
company
and
an
employee
or
contract
before
the
industry
who
had
this
car
upon
their
private
(inaudible)
we
owed
him
no
duty
as
to
safety
appliances.
as
i
understand
the
law,
the
law
--
the
safety
appliance
act
is
regarded
as
supplemental
to
the
federal
employees
liability
act
and
thereby
makes
absolute
duty
to
railroad
employees
which
they
can
demand
in
case
of
injury.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
i
so
understand
it,
sir.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no
sir.
he
--
he
is
just
a
local
man
that
works
on
the
pump.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes.
i
mean
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
well,
when
we
--
then
we
are
getting
yet
another
subject,
of
course.
this
court
has
held
that
the
--
a
failure
to
maintain
proper
average
that's
required
by
the
i.c.c.
or
is
such
a
danger
to
the
public
generally
that
a
non-railroad
employee
can
--
non-railroad
plaintiff
can't
recover
under
that
act.
but
it
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
as
such
--
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
as
such
it
is
a
failure
to
maintain
a
safety
appliance
in
which
the
public
generally
has
a
vital
interest,
but
we
don't
have
a
situation
here.
this
man
isn't
public
generally,
he's
just
a
specialist.
they'd
call
into
this.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
no,
sir.
but
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
of
course,
an
allegation
or
a
proof
of
a
violation
of
safety
appliance
act
that
makes
the
liability
absolute.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
under
the
f.e.l.a.,
this
court
has
said
the
safety
appliance
act
did
not
create
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
it's
created
by
the
f.e.l.a.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
you
held
that
in
the
merit
of
the
case,
sir,
with
respect
to
the
pubic.
i
don't
recall
the
others.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
i
think
that
we're
on
references
to
that
effect
in
those
cases
but
there
has
been
no
case
where
an
employee
of
an
industry
upon
that
all
that
it
is
completely
offline,
and
in
its
possession
has
a
cause
of
action
under
the
safety
appliance
act.
mr.
norman
c.
shepard
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
word
reply
in
section
11
permits
or
requires
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
say
what
the
running
board
shall
