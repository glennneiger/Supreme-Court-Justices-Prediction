mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
the
petitioner
was
an
independent
contractor
engaged
in
the
business
of
unloading
tank
cars
of
gasoline
for
delivery
to
local
consignees
of
that
gas
in
montgomery.
the
petitioner,
mr.
shields,
went
upon
the
tank
car
that,
from
which
he
suffered
his
injury,
called
the
purpose
of
unloading
this
gasoline.
it
is
necessary
on
the
type
of
the
tank
car
that
he
was
working
upon
for
him
to
climb
to
the
dome
of
the
tank
which
is
some
10
feet
in
the
air
to
release
the
--
open
the
dome
and
to
turn
the
valve.
there
is
a
board
there
at
the
top
of
a
short
ladder,
right
there
at
the
dome,
which
is
put
there
for
the
primary
purpose
of
having
people
stand
there
while
they
do
the
operation
that
petitioner
was
about
to
do.
this
board
was
admittedly
so
rotten
that
it
crumbles
in
your
hand.
when
petitioner
stepped
upon
this
board,
it
fell
to
the
ground
and
he
fell
with
it,
suffering
severe
injuries
to
his
back,
and
was
permanently
injured.
the
case
went
to
the
jury,
the
district
court
lay
on
montgomery
on
two
counts
of
a
complaint,
one
sounding
in
common
law
of
negligence,
the
other
relying
on
the
safety
appliance
act.
the
jury
rendered
a
general
verdict
in
the
amount
of
$7500
and
the
district
court
affirmed
it.
the
case
then
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
orleans.
that
court
found
that
it
could
not
determine
whether
the
jury
had
decided
then
on
the
ground
of
common
law
of
negligence
or
on
the
ground
of
safety
appliance
act
and
sets
in
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
safety
appliance
act
was
not
properly
invoked.
it
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
trial
on
common
law
negligence
grounds
alone.
it
was
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
failure
of
the
i.c.c.
to
issue
any
regulations
standardizing
this
appliance,
which
we
call
a
running
board,
was
conclusive
proof
of
an
administrative
determination
that
this
board
was
not
a
safety
appliance.
it
was
from
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
petition
of
certiorari
was
filed
and
that
the
case
is
now
here.
now
the
--
our
case
is
very
simply
stated,
the
theory
on
which
we
rely
for
recovery
is
this,
the
section
11
of
the
safety
appliance
act
states
that
all
cars
requiring
secure
ladders
and
running
boards
shall
be
equipped
with
such
ladders
and
running
boards.
this
was
a
running
board,
it
was
insecure
and
rotten.
petitioner
stepped
on
it
and
fell
to
the
painful
injuries
which
there's
no
dispute
about.
now,
to
this
simple
statement
of
our
theory
of
recovery,
the
defendant
has
--
our
respondent
here
has
raised
three
defenses
which
we'd
like
to
discuss
with
the
court.
the
first
defense
raised
by
respondent
is
that
this
is
not
a
running
board
because
it
was
not
standardized
by
the
i.c.c.
and
respondent,
in
his
brief,
condemns
petitioner
for
what
he
calls
petitioner's
persistent
assumption
that
this
was
a
running
board.
and
an
answer
to
that
is
simply
this,
that
the
railroad
was
just
as
persistent
in
calling
this
a
running
board
until
the
railroad
was
confronted
with
a
violation
of
those
--
with
the
safety
appliance
act
provisions
about
having
a
running
board
secured.
the
railroads
repair
order,
which
was
put
in
evidence
in
this
case,
showed
that
the
railroad
called
it
a
dome
running
board.
the
superintendent
of
the
railroad
in
answering
interrogatories
propounded
to
the
railroad
by
the
petitioner,
shields,
answered
no
less
than
seven
times
calling
this
a
running
board.
even
on
the
trial,
the
counsel
saw
the
railroad
and
witnesses
called
by
the
railroad
referred
to
it
on
more
than
one
occasion
as
a
running
board.
this
idea
that
it's
not
a
running
board
is
something
fair
at
length
that
has
been
thought
of
by
the
railroad
and
the
railroad
is
upset
because
petitioner
won't
join
the
railroad
in
its
inconsistency.
but
the
sole
basis
on
which
the
railroad
relies
in
its
contention
that
this
is
not
a
running
board
is
the
absence
of
any
regulations
on
the
subject
by
the
i.c.c.
and
as
we
shall
demonstrate
the
failure
of
the
i.c.c.
to
standardize
this
appliance
has
absolutely
no
significance
in
determining
whether
this
is
in
fact
the
running
board.
the
i.c.c.
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
in
which
it
acknowledges
that
the
ladder
which
goes
to
this
running
board
is
also
not
standardized.
now,
the
i.c.c.
doesn't
contend
that
that
ladder
is
in
a
lesser
ladder
because
of
its
failure
to
standardize
it.
and
we
can't
see
why
this
running
board
should
be
designated
as
any
lesser
running
board
because
of
its
failure
to
standardize.
the
i.c.c.
contends
that
it
has
failed
to
standardize
this
appliance
because
it
is
not
an
appliance
which
is
primarily
used
in
the
movement
of
a
train.
and
we
want
to
discuss
in
a
few
minutes
the
--
what
we
think
is
the
erroneous
ground
for
not
so
regarding
it
as
a
safety
appliance,
that
is
the
ground
offered
by
the
i.c.c.
we
think
that
when
congress
used
the
term
"running
board",
it
must
have
used
it
with
reference
to
railroad
pallets.
now,
the
term
was
designated
in
railroad
pallets
and
this
record
as
has
already
been
shown
is
full
of
evidence,
almost
without
dispute,
that
this
appliance
is
known
in
railroad
pallets
as
the
running
board.
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
that
some
employees
call
it
a
dome
step
board,
and
in
that
connection,
webster's
new
international
dictionary
defines
a
running
board
as
a
clip
board.
so,
we
think
that
the
term
is
certainly
synonymous
but
the
evidence
also
is
clear
in
the
record
that
the
car
inspector
with
25
years
of
experience
on
the
railroad
says
that
it's
always
--
it's
known
by
him
as
a
dome
running
board
or
a
top
running
board.
so
there
was
adequate
evidence
for
the
trial
court
to
have
found
as
it
did
find
that
this
was
the
running
board
and
submit
the
question
of
whether
that
running
board
was
secure
to
the
jury.
now,
i
think
the
principal
argument
of
the
i.c.c.
--
of
the
railroad
here,
however,
is
that
even
if
this
be
a
running
board,
the
omission
of
the
i.c.c.
to
standardize
it
means
that
it
is
not
a
safety
appliance.
now,
this
contention
is
based
on
the
railroad's
conception
that
when
congress
gave
in
section
12,
the
authority
to
the
i.c.c.
to
standardized
these
appliances
that
it
was
also
giving
to
the
i.c.c.
the
right
to
say
which
appliances
shall
be
secured.
we
point
out,
however,
that
section
11
of
the
act
just
simply
says
all
cars
requiring
secure
ladders
and
secure
running
boards
shall
be
equipped
with
such
ladders
and
running
boards.
and
then,
section
12
gives
the
i.c.c.
the
right
to
standardize
those
appliances.
we
submit
that
the
railroad
is
omitting
to
note
the
interplay
of
these
two
sections.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
section
12,
you
mean
set
out
in
briefs?
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
we
think
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
section
12.
that
--
that
says
the
number,
dimensions,
location
and
manner
of
application
of
the
appliances
provided
for
by
section
4
and
11,
this
title
is
designated
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shall
remain
as
the
standards
of
equipment
to
be
used
on
all
cars
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
11
and
16
of
this
title.
and
then
down
further,
it
says
that
failure
to
comply
with
any
requirement
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shall
be
subject
to
a
light
penalty
as
failure
to
comply
with
any
requirement
of
sections
11
and
16
of
this
title.
so,
we
submit
that
congress
clearly
had
its
eye
on
two
--
two
enables.
one
was
the
failure
of
railroads
in
many
cases
to
keep
these
appliances
secure
and
that's
what
section
11
was
designed
to
prevent.
section
12
was
designed
to
prevent
the
evil
of
not
having
these
appliances
standardized
so
that
on
a
dark
night
of
railroad
employee
might
reach
for
a
handhold
that
he
might
think
should
be
there
or
a
running
board
that
is
ordinarily
there
and
might
not
be.
so
those
were
the
two
enables
but
we
submit
that
by
giving
as
--
the
i.c.c.
the
authority
to
standardize
these
appliances,
there
was
no
intent
on
congress,
whatsoever,
to
take
it
away
from
its
clear
command
in
section
11
that
running
boards
and
ladders
be
maintained
in
a
secure
condition.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
they
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
this
--
a
picture
of
this
tank
car
is
attached
here
as
an
exhibit.
this
is
a
tank
car
with
--
with
a
dome
on
top
and
a
short
ladder
leading
up
to
this
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
there's
--
i
think
the
only
thing
in
the
record
on
that
point
is
that
some
cars
do
not
have
this
running
board
near
the
dome.
some
cars,
as
i
understand
it,
are
designed
so
that
it's
not
even
necessary
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
car
to
release
the
contents
of
the
car.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
think
--
i
think
all
cars
that
are
like
this
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
do
have
a
running
board
or
a
platform
board
up
there
so
that
use
of
whoever
is
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
now,
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
we
--
we
didn't
have
that
running
board
here.
but
we
also
have
a
running
board
which
is
not
described
any
way
in
the
regulations.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
and
it's
the
contention
of
this
court
of
--
it
was
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
this
contention
of
the
railroad
that
that
omission
to
standardize
that
appliance
that
on
the
--
on
the
top
of
the
--
of
the
tank
car
makes
it
not
a
safety
appliance.
but
we
contend
that
section
11
which
says,
"all
cars
requiring
secure
running
board
shall
be
equipped
with
such
running
boards
isn't
clear
to
men
regardless
of
what
the
i.c.c.
does
about
the
standardization
of
this
appliance."
now,
i
point
out
in
connection
with
this
interplay
of
these
two
sections
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
it
--
it
is
their
view
that
it
is
not
compulsory
and
we
think
that
there
are
practical
reasons
why
the
i.c.c.
may
not
wish
to
standardize
this
particular
board
because
the
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
we
would
think
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
have
any
board
particularly
if
you
don't
take
the
oil
out
or
gasoline
out
without
going
to
the
top.
now,
we
think
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
this
car
has
a
ladder.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
and
the
i.c.c.
has
not
standardized
that
ladder
but
they
don't
contend
it's
any
less
of
the
ladder
because
they
haven't
standardized
it.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
asked
the
--
i
think
it's
the
marshal
who
probably
handled
this.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
it's
come
up
with
the
record
but
there's
only
one
picture.
now,
we
think
the
williams
case
had
some
light
on
this
problem.
this
was
a
case
which
--
this
court
decided
when
the
--
a
man
was
injured
when
a
ladder
broke
and
he
--
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
there
had
been
no
i.c.c.
orders
promulgated
at
all.
and
it
was
the
contention
of
the
railroad
in
that
case
that
in
the
absence
of
any
i.c.c.
regulations,
there
couldn't
be
any
liability.
but
this
court
committing
upon
the
difference
between
the
section
of
--
what
we
now
called
section
11
and
section
12
says
that
as
to
section
11,
there
is
an
imperative
statute
--
an
absolute
and
imperative
statutory
--
statutory
duty
of
making
them
secure.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
discuss
the
other
responsibility
under
the
next
section
of
standardizing.
but
even
in
the
absence
of
any
i.c.c.
regulations,
this
court
in
the
williams
case
held
that
those
appliances
had
to
be
maintained
secure.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that
--
now,
when
you
say
that
the
statute
doesn't
require
this,
i
don't
--
don't
quite
go
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
the
statute
says
--
the
statute
says
all
cars
requiring
secure
running
board
shall
be
equipped
with
such.
now,
it's
our
contention,
and
in
the
williams
case,
this
court
uses
the
language
requiring
for
their
proper
use.
and
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
the
ladder
in
the
williams
case,
the
type
of
box
car
was
it
did
require
for
its
proper
use,
the
ladder.
and
therefore,
it
had
to
be
saved.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
--
i
should
say
--i
should
--
should
answer
it
this
way
that
safety
appliance
act
says
that
in
--
in
--
and
then
i
view
it
that
--
in
reading
it
with
the
williams
case
that
if
the
running
board
is
required
for
the
--
for
the
efficient
use
of
the
car,
then
it
must
be
secured.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
if
--
if
they
will
go
release
the
gasoline
form
the
bottom
of
the
--
of
the
car
it
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir,
we
could
not.
but
i
--i
question
whether
you
could
have
had
this
car
operating
in
the
way
that
it
did
where
you
had
to
climb
to
the
top,
if
you
didn't
have
something
in
the
nature
of
a
running
board
there
for
the
man
to
stand
upon.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
it
--
the
section
11
of
the
act
spells
out
in
detail
what
safety
appliances
are.
the
first
term
as
sill
steps,
all
cars
shall
be
equipped
with
secure
sill
step.
the
cars
requiring
secure
running
board
shall
be
equipped
with
such.
and
it
goes
on
in
details
in
that
act
which
the
williams
case
said
was
a
clear
statutory
command.
it
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
they
are
--
they
are
others,
handbrakes
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
i
think
there
are
other
sections
which
refer
to
safety
appliance
to
this
section
9,
i
think,
referring
to
--
to
brakes
and
so
forth,
references,
other
safety
appliances.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
think
in
deciding
how
much
weight
should
be
given
to
it,
we
--
we
should
examine
the
reason
advanced
by
the
i.c.c.
for
regarding
it
is
outside
the
safety
appliance
act
and
the
i.c.c.
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
--
i
--
my
position
is
that
--
that
this
particular
car
requires
a
running
board
for
its
proper
use.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
i
--
on
this
--
on
all
tank
cars,
no.
but
on
this
car,
it
is
required
in
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
in
this
--
in
this
case,
i
say
it
is
required
for
the
proper
use
of
this
kind.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
that's
right.
now,
the
reason
the
commission
says
it
is
not
is
that
--
that
the
commission
says
that
section
11
was
referring
only
to
appliances
that
were
used
in
the
movement
of
a
car.
now
factually,
we
think
the
i.c.c.
is
incorrect
in
saying
that
this
board
is
not
used
in
the
movement
of
the
car.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
they'd
said
that
in
their
brief.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no,
sir,
just
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
it
haven't
been
called
our
attention
that
the
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes.
i
was
only
attempted
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
--
as
to
where
there'd
been
any
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
there
hadn't
been
any
case
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
it
--
it
hasn't
been
called
our
attention
in
brief
or
elsewhere.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
but
i
--
i
take
it
that
justice
black's
question
goes
to
whether
there
had
been
a
determination
in
a
--
in
a
hearing
by
the
i.c.c.
to
that,
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
not
been.
they
have
filed
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
let
me
go
just
a
minute
into
the
reason
advanced
by
the
i.c.c.
for
this
thing.
as
i
say,
in
fact,
i
think
they're
incorrect
in
saying
that
this
board
is
not
using
the
movement
of
cars.
the
evidence
in
the
record
from
a
car
inspector
with
25
years
experience
was
it
--
it
frequently
mean
when
i
found
this
board
to
pass
hand
signals
that
if
it
--
if
the
dome
top
on
this
car
became
loose
in
the
movement
of
the
train
and
if
the
railroad
employee
might
have
to
go
up
there
to
--
and
he'd
seen
employees
have
to
go
up
there
to
tap
that
thing
down
with
gasoline
on
the
inside
and
its
dome
tank.
not
racking
up
and
down,
i
think
the
court
can
readily
see
the
necessity
for
getting
up
there
in
such
a
circumstance.
but
the
main
thing
that
the
i.c.c.
says
is
not
supported
by
anything
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
if
congress
said
they
intended
only
those
running
boards
used
in
the
movement
of
a
car
to
be
standardized,
congress
clearly
could
have
so
stated.
it
is
true,
as
the
i.c.c.
says
in
its
brief,
i
supposed,
that
congress
had
its
attention
primarily
focused
on
the
toll
of
accidents
that
occurred
to
employees
on
moving
trains.
but
congress
didn't
seem
fit
to
say
that
only
running
boards
used
in
the
movement
of
trains
were
covered
by
the
act.
the
i.c.c.
has
simply
--
with
--
by
sharing
interest
inserted
those
words
in
there.
i
think
congress
was
aware
that
a
fall
from
the
top
of
a
--
top
running
board
was
just
as
serious
as
a
fall
from
a
bottom
running
board
and
would
never
have
made
the
--
inserted
the
words
of
the
i.c.c.
has
cited
--
isn't
cited
in
there.
now,
i'd
like
to
mention
for
just
a
minute,
the
argument
of
the
railroad
and
the
i.c.c.
that
the
words
in
section
11
where
it
says
that
all
cars
requiring
secure
running
boards
means
all
cars
required
by
the
i.c.c.
to
have
secure
running
boards.
there
again,
they
have
simply
inserted
into
the
act
language
that
congress
didn't
seem
fit
to
insert
for
itself.
we
think,
if
you
read
these
--
these
sections
--
section
11
as
a
whole,
it's
readily
apparent
what
congress
had
in
mind
by
the
use
of
the
word
requiring.
it
said
all
cars
must
be
equipped
with
secure
sill
steps
and
efficient
handbrakes.
all
cars
requiring
secure
ladders
and
secure
running
boards
shall
be
equipped
with
such
because
all
cars
do
not
require
ladders
and
running
boards.
a
gondola
car,
for
example,
has
no
running
board
on
it,
and
congress
was
not
attempting
to
require
the
railroad
to
go
to
useless
expense
and
put
running
boards
where
it
--
where
they
weren't
needed.
and
again,
in
the
williams
case,
the
court
gave
the
language
requiring,
we
submit
its
proper
interpretation
which
was
cars
requiring
for
their
proper
use.
these
running
boards
shall
be
equipped
with
such.
and
the
last
comment
i'd
like
to
make
on
that
construction
is
that
the
tense
of
the
word
"requiring"
would
be
all
wrong.
if
congress
in
section
11
were
referencing
regulations
of
the
i.c.c.
because
at
the
time
congress
wrote
section
11,
there
were
no
regulations
by
the
i.c.c.
so,
if
they'd
any
i.c.c.
regulations
in
mind,
they
certainly
would
have
said
because
--
which
shall
be
required
to
have
secure
running
boards.
so
we
submit
that
the
omission
of
the
i.c.c.
to
standardize
this
appliance
cannot
take
away
the
protection
that
congress
was
plainly
trying
to
give
employees
in
section
11
that
railroads
must
maintain
running
boards
in
a
secure
manner.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
we
don't
think
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
well,
we
think
that
goes
to
the
desire
of
congress
to
have
cited
these
appliances
made
uniform.
and
the
i.c.c.
has
--
we
submit,
has
authority
right
now
to
--
to
make
a
uniformity
order
with
respect
to
this
running
board
if
it
was
to
require
on
all
cars,
it
can
do
so.
but
we
see
no
practical
reason
why
they
should
free
as
the
design
of
tank
cars,
some
cars
have
it,
some
don't.
but
if
a
car
is
designed
that
requires
for
its
proper
use
of
this
type
of
running
board,
then
it
has
to
be
secure
whether
the
i.c.c.
sees
fit
to
standardize
that
appliance
or
not.
and
the
reason
the
i.c.c.
gives
for
its
failure
to
standardize
is
the
reason
that
it
inserts
into
section
11
by
share
inference.
there
is
not
a
word
in
section
11
to
indicate
that
congress
didn't
intend
running
boards
on
the
top
of
cars
to
be
maintained
securely
just
as
they
intended
that
running
boards
on
the
bottom
of
a
car
be
made.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
and
when
they
designate
the
number,
it
--
the
act
goes
on
to
say,
this
shall
remain
as
the
standards
of
equipment
to
be
used
on
all
cars
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
11,
which
is
your
section
2,
subject
to
provision
of
section
11.
and
then,
a
little
later
on,
in
the
same
sentence,
it
says
that
failure
to
comply
with
regulations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shall
be
subject
to
a
light
penalty
as
failure
to
comply
with
any
requirement
of
section
11.
so,
there
were
two
evils.
one
was
the
uniformity
was
to
be
implemented
by
the
i.c.c.'s
regulations
that
--
but
the
--
as
this
court
said
the
absolute,
imperative
statutory
command
of
section
11
could
not
be
avoided
by
i.c.c.
regulations.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
hope
that's
--
i
think
it's
probably
correct
that
would
--
that
would
give
me
a
feeling
of
comfort
if
we
had
to
go
back
and
try
this
thing
over
to
feel
if
that
would
be
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
i
think
they're
allowed,
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
practice
there.
it's
very,
very
rarely
availed
of.
i
think
it
would
be
allowed,
perhaps
in
the
district
court
and
state
court.
i've
--
i've
never
seen
--
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
yes,
sir.
mr.
truman
m.
hobbs
no.[laughs]
