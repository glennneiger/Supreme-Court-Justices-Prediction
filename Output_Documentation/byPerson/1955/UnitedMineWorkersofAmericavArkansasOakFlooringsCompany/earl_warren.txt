chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harris,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pitts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
say
that
would
be
taken
away
from
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
the
board
base
that
upon
a
specific
section
of
the
labor
relations
act
or
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
--
mr.
pitts,
you
mentioned
a
little
while
ago
that
there
were
several
situations
in
which
the
employers
such
as
you
are
now
would
have
to
give
up
something
if
the
contrary
was
found.
now,
will
you
enumerate
those
please,
you
gave
us
that
one
but
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
didn't
hear
the
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
--
if
you're
going
to
get
to
it
later,
that's
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
won't
have
to
get
a
majority
of
the
employees,
wouldn't
they,
the
other
union?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
--
where
do
you
find
authority
in
the
act
for
that,
what
language
do
you
point
to?

justice

where
is
that
quoted?
is
that
on
page
47?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
wouldn't
be
the
situation
here,
it
wouldn't
be
certified,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
this
case
the
--
the
attempt
was
not
made
--
is
not
here
to
make
you
enter
into
a
contract,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
recognized
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
you
recognize
the
--
recognize
the
union
but
refuse
to
bargain
with
them
for
--
for
any
reason
that
you
might
choose
that
could
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
could
go
to
the
board.
you
could
then
have
a
hearing,
could
you
not,
on
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
question
of
compliance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
make
the
contract
with
the
other
union
that
you
wanted
to
deal
with
if
they
had
a
majority
of
the
employees
and
then
if
they
interfered
with
you,
you
could
take
them
before
the
board,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
that
--
then
you
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
could
take
them
before
the
board
could
you
not
as
being
--
for
having
commitment
an
unfair
labor
practice
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
unfair
labor
practice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
--
where
is
the
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
congress,
why
didn't
they
say
that
under
no
circumstances
that
they
come
before
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pitts,
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
this
question?
suppose
tomorrow
the
united
mine
workers
were
to
comply
and
file
these
affidavits,
what
would
happen
to
your
injunction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
have
no
--
no
effect.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
that
being
true
then
the
federal
government
would
had
--
have
complete
control
of
the
situation,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
mean
under
the
--
under
the
labor
relations
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
mean
to
judge
of
the
--
of
the
rights
between
that
union
and
--
and
employers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
labor
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
given
under
the
act,
yes.
then
wouldn't
that
indicate
to
you
that
congress
had
preempted
that
field
and
i
was
going
to
follow
that
with
another
question
and
ask
you
if
congress
did
preempt
that
field
would
the
fact
that
it
required
certain
acts
of
compliance
divest
the
federal
government
of
its
jurisdiction
during
the
time
that
compliance
was
not
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
one
thing
for
the
government
not
to
give
any
protection
to
such
a
union
and
another
thing
for
the
federal
government
to
divest
itself
of
jurisdiction
in
such
cases
when
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
have
a
national
policy
for
the
settlement
of
such
disputes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
issue
was
raised
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
pardon
me.
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
pleadings
and
you
didn't
offer
any
proof
as
against
the
proof
what
they
had
in
the
prima
facie
too,
that
you
found
by,
don't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
can't
eat
your
pie
and
keep
it.
you
can't
--
you
can't
say
that
you
offered
no
proof
in
response
to
these
pleadings
and
then
at
the
same
time
say
to
this
court
that
you
doubt
very
seriously
whether
they
had
that
majority,
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
different
thing.
that's
a
different
question.
i
--
how
do
i
(inaudible)
but
that's
my
question
to
that,
if
you
take
that
position
i
understand
a
great
deal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
