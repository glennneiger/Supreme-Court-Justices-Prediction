mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
the
court
please.
i
am
going
to
have
to
be
more
specific
in
the
discussion
of
the
sections
of
the
labor
relations
or
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
mr.
harris.
the
union
in
this
case
is
district
50
of
the
united
mine
workers.
this
is
a
union
which
has
deliberately
and
as
a
matter
of
policy
refused
to
comply
with
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
it
was
not
admittedly
inadvertently
or
temporarily
out
of
compliance.
that
is
a
studied
union
policy
in
this
case.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
that's
the
gravamen
of
this
case
in
the
light
of
the
interpretation
of
the
effective
--
the
action
of
this
union
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
now,
here
is
what
happened.
a
representative
of
the
union
called
upon
the
employer
and
says
we
want
representation.
we
want
to
be
recognized.
the
company
was
familiar
with
the
fact
that
this
district
50
was
a
non-complying
union
that
it
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
sections
of
the
act
which
require
the
execution
of
the
non-communist
oath
and
the
filing
of
the
financial
data
giving
the
disclosure
to
the
proper
authorities
of
the
--
disclose
your
financial
information
dues
and
things
of
that
type
to
union
members.
now,
the
employer
in
this
case
stated
that
the
board
does
not
recognize
you
and
for
that
reason
we
will
not
deal
with
you
and
we
will
not
bargain
with
you.
now,
the
employer
here
feels
that
if
it
had
agreed
to
bargain
and
deal
with
this
union
it
would
have
given
up
certain
substantial
rights
which
it
has
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
in
the
first
place,
if
this
were
a
complying
union
that
had
made
that
demand
the
employer
could
have
said,
"well
now
we
do
not
accept
your
protestation
of
majority
status.
you
see
that
you
represent
a
majority
but
we
wish
to
have
a
board
supervised
secret
election."
as
one
of
things
that
was
kept
--
would
have
been
taken
away
from
us
if
we
had
volunteer
to
recognize
this
union.
now,
if
your
honor's
please
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
your
honor
please,
the
board
itself
has
held
that
it
will
not
entertain
a
petition
for
an
election
even
as
to
the
employer.
now,
it's
obvious
that
the
union
could
not
go
before
the
board
because
it
has
not
complied
and
that
all
the
board
processes
were
denied
to
this
union,
and
the
board
is
likewise
held
that
we
could
not
go
with
the
board
under
those
circumstances
and
petition
for
an
election.
and
the
reasoning
is
this,
if
the
board
found
that
the
union
did
have
a
majority,
the
union
on
under
such
circumstances
would
be
indirectly
getting
the
benefit
of
the
processes
of
the
board.
now
i
have
cited
the
several
cases
which
the
board
quotes
that
in
the
brief
and
that
was
one
of
the
material
things
it
was
commented
upon
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
your
honor,
that's
not
a
--
that's
not
a
section
of
the
act,
that's
a
judicial
interpretation
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
by
the
board.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no,
sir.
we
could
not
go
to
the
board.
that
is
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
things
we
have
been
denied
under
the
act.
now,
that
seems
clear.
now,
the
obvious
answer
to
that
is
that
the
brief
filed
by
the
board
in
this
case
did
not
even
intimate
it.
we
could
have
gone
to
the
board
and
obtained
an
election
and
of
course
the
board
has
so
held.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no.
it
just
--
it
based
it
under
section
--
on
sections
9
(g)
and
(h),
(f),
(g),
and
(h)
which
denied
the
services
of
the
board
and
the
processes
of
the
board
to
any
non-complying
union.
and
they
say
even
if
the
employer
is
the
one
who
asks
for
the
election,
we
won't
call
it
an
election
because
if
we
finally
decide
that
the
union
wins,
we
are
indirectly
defeating
the
purpose
of
the
act
in
giving
the
result
of
the
election.
and
--
and
they
say
further
that
if
they
should
find,
if
they
should
hold
an
election
and
find
that
the
union
was
successful
and
had
a
majority,
they
couldn't
certify
them
because
that
is
denied
under
the
act.
so
that's
one
of
the
first
things,
there
are
several
other
disadvantages
that
we
have
given
up
on.
i'm
seeing
at
the
outset
the
reasons
why
we
object
dealing
with
a
non-complying
union.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
that's
the
--
that's
the
flat
proposition
that
we
have
before
this
court,
whether
we
have
to
deal
with
--
and
bargain
with
this
non-complying
union.
now
i
say
this,
if
--
if
we
refuse
to
bargain
with
this
union
and
your
honors
overrule
the
state
court
decision
and
let
them
put
a
picket
line
back,
we
still
do
not
legally
have
to
bargain
with
them
because
they
can't
go
out
before
the
board
and
compel
us
to
bargain
with
them.
that's
obviously
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
refuse
them
--
to
refuse
to
bargain.
so
that
the
board
was
--
is
the
only
agency
that
have
a
right
to
hear
that
question.
but
they
have
--
whoever
shut
them
off,
seals
off,
from
any
possible
board
relief
by
refusing
to
comply
with
this
act.
incidentally
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
your
honor
under
that
section,
the
board
had
repeatedly
held
that
it
will
not
entertain
an
election
on
the
--
at
the
request
of
the
employer.
it's
obviously
to
inflict
--
that
the
union
under
such
circumstances
did
not
go
before
the
board
because
they
can't
go
before
the
board
under
any
circumstance.
but
the
board
has
held
and
construe
in
that
section
that
it
does
not
have
to
--
it
will
not
call
an
election
even
at
the
behest
of
the
employer.
now,
the
question
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
of
course
the
statute
your
honor
states
that
it
will
not
hold
the
--
would
not
hold
the
election
on
a
request
of
the
labor
organization,
would
the
holdings
of
the
board
are
to
the
same
effect
with
reference
to
the
petition
by
the
employer.
i'll
find
it
for
your
honors
in
one
moment.
i
--
i'll
pass
to
--
to
the
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
i
was
looking
for
the
board
case
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
to
give
your
honor
a
reference
to
the
board
case
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
which
expressly
holds
that
an
election
will
not
be
called
where
a
non-complying
union
is
involved.
now,
they
had
so
here.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
what
--
what
was
it?
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
that's
--
that's
the
case.
i
understand
if
we
could
--
all
we
could
do
would
be
ask
one
election
in
certification.
now,
that
is
what
the
board
says
it
will
not
do
where
the
non-complying
union
would
obtain
it
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
the
benefit
of
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
--
that's
the
act
itself
which
prevents
the
--
in
other
words
if
we
refuse
to
bargain
then
the
one
to
go
before
the
board
would
be
the
union
and
it
cannot
go
before
the
board
on
that
--
or
any
other
matter.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
your
honor
please,
here
is
the
case
which
i
have
in
mind
is
herman
loewenstein,
incorporated
reported
in
75
n.
l.
r.
b.
that's
on
the
appendix,
page
27
of
the
respondent's
brief.
now,
they
have
gone
in
that
case,
they
say
this,
although
it
is
the
employer's
petition
in
a
circuit
case,
and
so
on
the
next
page
28,
it
sets
the
board's
machinery
in
motion.
it
is
an
individuals
or
a
labor
organization's
initial
claim
for
recognition
that
makes
it
possible
for
the
employer
to
invoke
that
machine.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
under
the
circumstances
they
will
refuse
even
the
employer
any
relief
under
the
act.
now,
so
if
the
court
please,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
before
the
court
here
is
whether
primary
picketing
by
a
non-complying
union
is
either
prohibited
by
the
management
labor
relations
act
or
whether
it
is
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
whether
it
is
a
fully
protected
right
under
the
act.
now
certain
practices
are
enumerated
in
the
act
as
unfair
labor
practices.
these
are
coercion
of
employees,
coercion
of
an
employer
in
selecting
his
negotiator,
a
union
refusal
to
bargain,
a
secondary
board
cut
and
things
of
that
type,
finally
they
wind
up
with
(inaudible).
it
is
obviously
not
any
one
of
these
things.
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
if
this
were
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
act,
we
could
go
before
the
board.
but
it
clearly
is
not
and
i
think
the
strongest
proof
or
intimation
that
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
there
is
no
intimation
whatever
in
the
board's
brief
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
the
board
has
held
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
primary
picketing
for
recognition
by
such
a
union
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
so
the
board
would
not
act
on
that
ground.
now,
of
course
as
this
court
has
said
if
it
weren't
an
unfair
labor
practice,
you
would
have
a
direct
conflict
between
the
board
and
the
state
courts.
and
in
that
case
we
would
have
an
easy
decision
to
the
effect
that
the
state
courts
had
no
jurisdiction.
so
to
pass
from
the
unfair
labor
practice
or
easy
phase
of
the
case,
we
come
to
the
cloudy
or
penumbral
area
as
it
had
been
referred
to
by
this
court.
and
parenthetically
when
i
was
attempting
to
reconcile
the
various
state
board,
labor
board
and
federal
court
of
appeal
decisions,
why,
i
could
progressively
appreciate
the
meaning
of
that
word,
penumbra,
and
i
always
had
to
come
back
to
what
i
consider
as
a
--
the
(inaudible)
landmark
cases
regulating
labor
relations
by
this
court.
one
of
the
cases
like
this
is
the
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
your
honor,
i
intended
to
cover
that
up,
but
i'll
happy
to
put
them
in
this
position.
maybe
i
should
have
done
that
first.
i
just
didn't
have
them
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
i'll
do
it
right
now,
i'll
be
happy
to.
the
first
was
that
we
were
deprived
of
the
right
to
avoid
supervised
election.
that's
the
one
that
i
mentioned.
in
other
words
we
regard
that
as
being
a
substantial
right
that
in
which
the
employer
is
protected
under
the
act.
in
other
words
we
don't
believe
that
we
have
to
accept
the
union's
efforts,
the
act
provides
for
election
,
the
hearing
by
the
board
and
we
say
that
we're
entitled
to
that
regardless
of
whether
they
say
they
have
a
majority
or
no.
now
the
next
--
incidentally
the
board
has
so
held
that
we
are
entitled
to
that
under
those
circumstances,
i'll
mention
that
case
later.
the
second
point
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
there
is
not
your
honor.
the
only
way
is
to
petition
for
an
election
and
certification.
and
that
has
been
denied
to
us,
not
for
many
things
that
we
did
but
because
the
union
has
failed
to
comply
with
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h).
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
your
honor
has
cite
it
up
perfectly.
that's
the
direct
holding
of
the
herman
loewenstein
case
and
that's
what
the
board
--
the
board
has
held.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
pleading
we've
alleged,
we
doubted
whether
they
had
a
majority
representation
and
that
of
course
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes.
and
we
still
doubt,
i
mean
and
we
see
that
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
have
to
accept
the
union's
version
of
whether
it
has
a
majority.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
is
true.
i
don't
believe
that's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
sir?
mr.
john
l.
pitts
i
don't
believe
that
it
is
--
i
don't
believe
that's
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
act
and
i
don't
believe
it's
so
held.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
i
do
--
the
--
the
board
has
held
that
a
primary
strike
for
that
purpose
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
in
fact
they
hold
that
if
it's
admittedly
a
minority
union,
that's
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
legally
constituted
representative,
yes,
your
honor,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
your
honor
please,
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
in
a
latest
expression
of
the
board,
the
sunset
lumber
products
case,
the
board
--
that
was
decided
last
year
in
the
year
1955,
the
board
held
that
when
an
employer
is
faced
with
the
demand
for
recognition
by
labor
organization,
at
page
31
in
my
brief,
which
claimed
to
represent
a
majority
of
his
employees,
he
may
refuse
to
rely
upon
evidence
of
the
union's
representation
and
insist
upon
the
union
establishing
its
majority
in
a
board
election.
now
it's
true
that
the
employer
must
act
in
good
faith
under
those
circumstances.
the
--
the
board
has
held
that
if
that
is
merely
a
subterfuge
and
if
the
employer
is
not
bonafide
in
asserting
it
decided
to
deal
with
a
recognized
and
certified
union
and
that's
an
effort
though
such
as
in
the
pecheur
lozenge
which
has
been
cited
in
the
joy
silk
mills
case.
they
say
that
if
the
employer
is
in
good
faith
and
he
starts
of
by
saying
he
wants
to
deal
only
with
a
recognized
union,
he
is
entitled
to
the
election.
now
to
get
back
to
your
honor's
question
about
what
the
other
advantages
are
for
us
to
deal
with
a
complying
union
or
a
certified
union
rather
than
a
non-complying
union
such
as
this,
apart
from
the
question
of
--
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
get
a
board
election,
we
would
be
free
from
labor
disturbances
because
if
we
contracted
with
this
non-complying
union,
any
other
union
could
come
in
and
fix
and
we'd
have
no
board
relief.
and
yet
if
this
was
a
certified
union
that
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
where
this
other
union
had
come
in
and
picket
us
while
we
have
a
contract
with
a
certified
union.
now
that's
an
advantage
to
the
employer,
a
very
definite
advantage
which
we
say
we're
entitled
to
under
the
act.
in
other
words
the
status
of
the
permits
of
a
recognized
certified
union.
now
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
wouldn't
--
if
your
honor
--
if
your
honor
please,
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
picket
line.
we
don't
want
the
picket
line.
in
other
words
even
if
we
--
even
if
we
are
dealing
that
they
could
not
get
representation
until
they
--
until
they
did
get
a
majority,
but
had
nothing
--
there
would
be
nothing
to
keep
us
--
keep
them
from
picketing
if
we
had
a
contract
with
a
non
complying
union.
now,
that
would
be
one
of
the
injustice.

enforce
states
to
engage
in,
or
induce,
or
encourage
the
employees
and
so
forth
and
down

(c),
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
to
recognize
or
bargain
with
a
particular
labor
organization
as
a
representative
of
his
employer
is,
if
another
labor
organization
has
been
certified
as
the
representative
of
such
employees
on
this
page
of
section
9.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well
--
well,
of
course
as
i
understand
that
--
that
makes
it
an
unlabor
--
unfair
labor
practice
to
picket
against
a
certified
union.
where
we
interpret
those
provision
is
that
if
we
contract
with
the
united
mine
workers
any
other
union
could
picket
us
during
the
term
of
that
contract
and
we'd
have
no
board
relief.
if
it
was
a
certified
union
we
would
have
board
relief.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
your
honor.
the
bargaining
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
recognized
and
that
leads
to
a
contract.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
they
could
--
they
couldn't
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
they
couldn't
take
it
the
board
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
i
mean
the
union
could
not
take
it
as
long
as
they
were
not
in
compliance.
it
couldn't
get
before
the
board.
we
wouldn't
bring
a
charge
against
ourselves
for
a
plea
or
to
bargain.
that
would
have
to
be
brought
by
the
union.
and
they
have
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
true,
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
but
that
--
let's
assume
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
let's
--
let's
assume
that
the
--
that
the
--
only
certified
union
does
have
the
majority
for
the
purpose
of
argument
and
discussion.
in
that
case
the
other
picketing
union
could
not
get
a
majority,
there
is
no
way
we
could
keep
them
from
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
continuing
to
picket.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
as
i
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
as
i
understand
it,
not,
where
the
picketing
is
against
a
non-compliant
union.
i
mean
where
you
have
a
contract
with
the
non-compliant
union.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
we
have
to
approach
it
from
this
standpoint.
we
have
to
bring
it
within
the
realm
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
if
we
stop
the
other
union
from
picketing.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
all
right
now,
section
8
(b)
said
it
should
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
its
agents,
i
am
going
over
to
four
in
top
of
page
47
to
engage
in
or
to
induce
or
encourage
employees
of
any
employer
to
engage
in
a
strike.
now
go
down
to
c,
now
where
the
object
there
is,
now
go
down
to
c,
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
to
recognize
or
bargain
with
a
particular
labor
organization
as
a
representative
of
his
employees
if
another
labor
organization
has
been
certified
as
a
representative
of
such
employees
under
the
provisions
of
section
9.
in
other
words
that's
the
only
case
where
we
have
an
unfair
labor
practice
while
you
have
another
union
picketing
against
us
is
where
you
have
a
--
where
they're
picketing
against
a
certified
union.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
that's
our
position.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
correct,
if
we
could
--
if
we
could
go
before
the
board
and
get
a
board
election
that
would
eliminate
that
phase
of
our
objection.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
that
apparently
is
a
board's
position
from
which
--
which
it
has
never
deviated
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
correct,
yes
we
have
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
i
--
i'd
say
this
that
there
is
no
question
involved
in
this
case
of
any
employee
discrimination
if
that's
what
the
question
is
leading
to.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
what
it
--
that's
what
it
has
ruled,
yes,
sir.
and
up
here.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
we
did
not
go
before
the
board.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
that
was
the
situation,
yes,
that
is
how
i
understand
it.
that's
what
it
was,
exactly.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
what
is
that?
mr.
john
l.
pitts
it
was
during
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
it
was
--
it
was
after
the
1947
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
amendment,
that's
all
i
can
say.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
the
reason
that
it
was
the
policy
of
the
board
is
not
to
afford
any
--
any
protection
or
services
to
a
non-complying
union
and
that
if
the
--
even
if
the
employer
were
the
one
that
invoked
the
processes
of
the
board
to
have
the
election
if
it
turned
out
that
the
labor
union
won
the
election,
then
in
such
case
the
board
would
be
depleting
the
purposes
of
the
act
by
permitting
the
union
to
get
the
indirect
benefit
which
the
act
did
not
intend
it
to
have.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
of
course
that's
--
that's
the
question
of
the
result
of
the
--
of
the
election.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
--
that's
the
board's
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
ruling
up
to
now.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
your
honors
please,
i
--
i
believe
that
under
these
leading
cases
when
this
court,
anheuser-busch
case
and
several
cases
recently
discussed
and
acted
upon
by
this
court
that
there
is
no
absolute
protection
to
an
non-complying
union
to
picket
for
recognition.
now
in
the
anheuser-busch
case
your
honors
stated
that
the
federal
act
has
not
absorbed
all
state
action
and
it
pointed
out
in
the
allen
bradley,
that
in
the
allen
bradley
case,
allen
bradley
local
against
wisconsin
board
the
states
were
permitted
to
enjoin
mass
picketing
and
blocking
of
plant
entrances
and
picketing
at
homes
and
that
type.
and
in
the
international
case
of
international
union
against
wisconsin
board,
the
court
allowed
a
state
injunction
against
the
current
wage
stoppages,
the
current
owner
now
for
wage
stoppages
that
had
a
tendency
to
upset
the
employer's
manufacturing
operations.
and
the
court
stated
that
if
the
particular
practice
is
neither
prohibited
nor
sanctioned
by
the
federal
act
then
it
is
left
to
the
regulations
of
the
states.
now,
we
say
that
there
is
no
definite
sanction
or
prohibition
against
primary
picketing
by
a
non-complying
union
in
this
act.
now
as
--
i
do
not
believe
that
section
7
and
13
of
the
act,
in
the
light
of
the
history
of
these
sections
was
intended
to
grant
protection
in
a
case
of
this
type
where
the
union
has
not
complied
with
the
direct
mandate
of
congress.
in
the
case
of
international
union
against
wisconsin
board,
this
court
stated
that
right
granted
in
section
7
contemplates
a
lawful
strike
and
does
not
legalize
any
and
every
type
of
concerted
activity.
now
i
say
that
under
the
rulings
of
these
cases
and
a
further
statement
of
the
court
at
section
7
(c)
and
13
do
not
give
any
special
dispensation
to
the
right
to
strike.
but
outlaw
strikes
to
enforce
labor
practice
to
enforce
unfair
labor
practices
that
this
court
could
well
hold
that
a
strike
under
these
circumstances
which
denies
us
the
rights
which
we
say
we
have
under
the
act
is
neither
prohibited
nor
protected.
under
the
--
i
believe
it
to
broad
purposes
of
the
wagner
and
the
taft
acts
were
to
eliminate
the
economic
loss
it
tendered
upon
strikes
in
every
case
where
it
was
possible.
now,
you
take
this
particular
case
right
here.
if
this
were
a
complying
union
and
made
a
demand
for
recognition,
they
would
not
have
to
strike
to
get
it,
they
could
go
before
the
board.
now
if
that
had
been
true
and
we
had
refused
and
they
had
gone
before
the
board,
why,
the
employees
would
have
been
still
earning
wages
and
the
company
would
have
been
in
production,
you've
had
no
interruption.
i
think
if
that
is
a
type
of
thing
its
intended
to
be
brought
about
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
labor
management
relations
act.
there's
no
material
change
in
either
of
these
sections
in
the
--
from
the
wagner
act
to
taft-hartley
act
in
the
act,
in
the
later
act
in
1947
amendment,
the
conspiracy
weapon
was
taken
away
from
the
employers.
in
other
words,
any
union
action,
it
was
otherwise
lawful
was
not
made
unlawful
simply
because
it
was
undertaken
by
several
persons
in
concert.
and
i
believe
it
those
were
the
principle
changes
that
were
made
in
section
713
in
the
act.
and
this
court
in
the
laburnum
case
stated
that
in
the
garner
case
the
very
care
which
the
court
took
to
point
out
that
if
a
--
that
if
a
conflict
existed
the
state
court
must
yield,
was
in
itself
on
assertion
that
if
there
was
no
conflict
then
a
state
action
would
survive.
i
say
that
in
this
case
there
cannot
possibly
be
any
conflict
between
the
state
court
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
board
has
forever
shut
itself
off
from
any
possible
remedy.
this
union
has
shut
itself
off
from
any
many
possible
remedy
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
it
can't
go
before
it
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
your
honor
please
that's
a
good
question
and
i
wonder
that
myself.
it
--
they
do
not
see
that
and
yet
they
deny
them
the
processes
of
the
board
and
the
only
answer
that
i
can
make
to
it
is
that
congress
thought
that
that
would
be
sanctions
enough
without
fining
them
a
$100
or
six
months
in
jail
or
something
of
that
type,
if
they
denied
them
the
processes
of
the
board,
they
felt
that
was
the
strongest
sanctions
they
could
have
put
on.
there's
no
condition
attached
to
these
qualifications.
it
says
that
the
union
shall
do
so
and
so.
and
i
believe
that
congress
undoubtedly
intended
that
they
be
complied
with
or
they
--
that
they
have
no
standing.
now
in
this
--
in
one
case
decided
by
this
court
on
another
point,
it
involved
the
time
of
filing
a
charge
in
the
time
of
issuance
of
the
compliant.
that
is
the
(inaudible)
russell
case
which
i
--
decided
by
this
court
and
referred
to
by
me
on
page
40
of
my
brief.
the
court
said
in
that
case
phrased
differently.
the
argument
is
that
the
benefits
of
the
act
may
not
flow
to
a
labor
organization
unless
the
non-communist
affidavits
were
on
file.
we
agree
with
the
argument
and
believe
it
is
in
accord
with
our
interpretation
of
section
9
(a).
that's
what
the
court
--
this
court
said
in
the
(inaudible)
russell
case.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
i
think
it
would
--
if
it
rephrase
it
--
well
i'd
say
this,
we'd
--
we'd
voluntarily
agree
that
it
was
no
longer
in
effect
and
we'd
have
to
recognize.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
i
would
agree
to
that.
well,
that
will
be
the
technical
legal
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
oh,
you
mean
congress?
mr.
john
l.
pitts
by
control
of
the
situation
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
to
the
extent
of
which
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
to
the
extent
of
--
of
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
--
the
rights
that
they're
given
under
the
act,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
would
be
a
proper
approach
to
the
problem.
i
think
it
is
--
so
long
as
they
deliberately
refuse
to
comply
with
what
the
act
says
they
should
do
then
i
think
they
should
--
they
at
least
have
waived
their
right
to
invoke
the
protection
of
the
act
during
that
period
of
their
non-compliance.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
they're
tied
in
together.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no,
sir
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
it
were
an
unfair
labor
practice
we
could
go
before
the
board
and
that's
one
case
where
we
could
go.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
but
it's
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
your
honor,
repeat
that
subsection
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
there
were
two
unions
in
--
being
involved
your
honor.
now,
the
petitioning
union
in
this
case
contend
before
this
court
that
the
state
court
decision
in
this
case
amounts
to
a
death
sentence
to
the
union.
well
if
that
be
true
i
say
that
it
is
a
voluntarily
inflicted
death
sentence
and
one
that
could
be
eliminated
immediately
upon
the
union
complying
with
this
provision
of
section
9
of
the
act.
and
if
it
comes
down
to
a
question
of
the
balancing
of
conveniences
as
to
the
hardships
that
would
work
on
us
to
deal
with
a
non-complying
union
and
a
hardship
that
will
work
on
the
union
--
by
complying
with
the
act
which
i
see
are
none,
then
i
see
that
the
scales
of
balance
in
favor
of
the
employer
because
we
engage
in
commerce,
we
come
under
the
act
regardless
and
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
--
any
advantages
there
that
might
possibly
approve
to
us
if
we
comply
with
our
part
of
it
and
we
say
the
union
must
do
likewise.
and
we
respectfully
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
state
court.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
your
honor.
the
evidence
however
was
more
or
less
formal.
i
mean
the
--
there
is
no
question
of
violence
involved
or
anything
of
that
type,
it
was
a
peaceful
picket
line
and
we
establish
the
fact
that
this
demand
for
recognition
had
been
made.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
we
didn't
go
into
the
question
of
--
in
other
words,
we
didn't
take
each
one
of
these
union
cards
and
go
into
it
and
say
call
him
and
say
did
you
sign
this
or
does
this
x
--
is
this
x
mark
your
signature
because
at
all
times
we
took
the
position
that
we
were
entitled
to
have
a
election
by
the
board
and
so
we
didn't
attempt
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
your
honor?
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no.
if
we
didn't
doubt
in
good
faith
as
to
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well
of
course
under
our
pleadings
in
louisiana
we
do
not
have
a
replication,
i
mean
--
we
--
the
petition
for
injunction
was
filed
and
the
union
did
claim
to
have
majority
and
i
think
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
he
presented
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
they
presented
the
evidence
that
there
were
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no,
sir.
no
(inaudible).
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
we
were
willing
to
bargain
with
them
if
the
board
--
if
we
had
a
board
election,
yes.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
in
effect,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
that's
it.
that's
--
that's
--
because
of
the
hardships
it
caused,
it
puts
on.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
i
--
well,
i'd
grant
you
--
i'd
grant
you,
your
honor
that
we
could
have
agreed
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
bad
faith
your
honor
in
all
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
that's
bad
faith
and
i
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
i
think
it
would
be,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
we
--
we
did
not
contest
it
in
the
case.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
yes.
we
--
we
contest
it.
we
--
we
really
do
because
the
employees
of
this
particular
employer
are
highly
illiterate.
they're
production
employees,
95%
of
them,
and
a
great
many
of
them
signed
with
x
marks
and
things
of
that
type.
and
we
actually
doubt
whether
they
had
an
employee
majority.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
we
didn't
attempt
to
prove
it
your
honor
because
they
had
the
cards
and
we
took
the
position
that
we
didn't
have
to
take
their
cards
and
decide
whether
they
constituted
a
majority
or
not.
there's
one
case
i'd
like
to
discuss
with
the
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
i
believe
that
under
the
latest
ruling
of
the
board
we
--
were
entitled
to
take
the
position
that
we
take
and
that's
the
sunset
lumber,
the
case
that
i
have
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
if
your
honor
--
if
your
honor
please,
it
goes
deeper
than
that,
we
contend
that
we
are
not
obligated
to
deal
with
the
non-complying
union.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no.
that's
true
but
i
think
it
would
be
conducted
under
the
fairest
circumstances
then
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes.
i
believe
it
get
a
free
expression
of
the
will
of
the
employees
and
i
think
if
that
was
a
purpose
of
setting
up
the
election
machinery
in
the
two
acts,
the
wagner
act
and
the
labor
management
relations
act.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes.
we
took
that
position.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
we
didn't
formally
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
no,
we
did
not
contest
the
majority,
if
your
honor
please.
we
took
the
position
that
we
were
entitled
to
an
election
and
were
not
willing
to
try
it
out
anyway.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
well,
we
made
that
--
mr.
john
l.
pitts
we
made
that
allegations
your
honor
and
to
tell
you
frankly
we
didn't
know
what
the
actual
facts
were
at
that
time
because
we
had
not
--
we
had
never
seen
these
cards.
you
know,
the
picket
line
was
set
up
and
in
the
practice
of
law
when
you
have
to
go
in
and
draw
in
a
petition
for
an
injunction
on
the
basis
of
what
information
you
have,
why,
your
allegations
might
not
exactly
conform
with
the
proof
that
you
met
with
when
you
try
the
injunction.
now,
on
a
trial
it
was
shown
that
they
had
a
174
cards
signed
up.
we
don't
deny
that
and
we
couldn't
reverse
it.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
yes,
yes.
we
could
have
done
that.
mr.
john
l.
pitts
225,
they
had
a
174
cards
out
of
225.
i
--
i
just
want
to
discuss
a
case
that
i
started
to
mention
a
moment
ago.
in
one
case,
a
union
was
recognized.
it
was
not
certified.
the
employer
voluntarily
recognized
the
union,
and
the
union
went
before
the
board
and
asked
for
a
certification.
and
employers
says
that
there's
no
need
for
a
certification,
an
election
because
i
have
already
recognized.
and
yet
in
that
case
the
board
says
that
there
are
certain
advantages
attached
to
the
status
of
a
certified
union
and
even
though
the
employer
has
recognized
the
union
you
are
entitled
to
go
ahead
and
have
the
election
and
be
certified.
now
that's
--
that
is
a
stamp
of
--
puts
a
stamp
of
approval
on
a
--
the
board
of
the
advantage
of
dealing
with
a
certified
union.
now,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
we
think
that
they'd
do
under
the
broad
purposes
of
the
act.
