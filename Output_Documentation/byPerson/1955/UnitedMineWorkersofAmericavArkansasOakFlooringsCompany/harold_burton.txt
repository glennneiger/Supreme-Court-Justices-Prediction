well,
the
point
that
i
had
in
mind
particularly
here
is
a
suit
being
brought
in
louisiana.
now,
if
one
of
the
allegations
is
that
there
is
picketing
where
there
was
only
a
minority,
that
seemed
to
be
a
matter
that
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
therefore
the
louisiana
case
would
be
out.
justice
harold
burton
now
--
and
you're
arguing
that
even
though
they
had
a
majority
it's
also
within
the
national
labor
relation
board
and
they're
out
again.
justice
harold
burton
but
i
would
think
they'd
clearly
be
out
in
the
first
instance
where
they
are
picketing
for
a
--
for
a
minority
because
that's
squarely
comes
under
the
national
labor
relations
board,
doesn't
it?
justice
harold
burton
that's
what
i
am
referring
to.
justice
harold
burton
does
the
national
labor
relations
board
have
some
jurisdiction
here?
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
you
may
assert
that
before
the
labor
board.
justice
harold
burton
is
it
your
position
that
they
must
assert
it
under
weber
and
garner?
what's
asserted
for
the
labor
board
under
weber
and
garner?
justice
harold
burton
what
--
what
has
become
of
the
provision
for
the
appropriate
unit
to
select
a
bargaining
agent?
justice
harold
burton
from
what's
in
my
mind
and
it
used
to
be
in
the
wagner
act
that
the
appropriate
unit
would
be
designated
by
the
board.
now,
that's
been
changed
as
i
understand
it
in
the
national
--
in
the
taft-hartley
amendments?
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
9
(a)
is
no
longer
reads
as
it
used
to.
now,
that
doesn't
--
do
anything
to
it
at
all?
justice
harold
burton
but
it
used
to
be
that
selection
would
have
to
be
made
an
appropriate
unit.
justice
harold
burton
(voice
overlap)
justice
harold
burton
especially
9
(a)
doesn't
read
that
way.
