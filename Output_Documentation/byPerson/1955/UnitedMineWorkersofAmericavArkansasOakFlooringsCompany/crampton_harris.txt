mr.
crampton
harris
if
the
court
pleases.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
upheld
an
injunction
issued
by
the
district
court
to
the
ninth
judicial
district
of
rapides
parish
which
enjoined
peaceful
picketing
in
a
primary
strike
for
recognition
picketing
only
by
the
employees
of
the
arkansas
oak
flooring
company.
and
the
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
was
that
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
was
not
recognized
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
it
had
not
filed
the
financial
reports
required
by
section
9
(f)
and
had
not
filed
the
non-communist
affidavit
required
by
section
9
(h).
the
facts
out
of
which
the
litigation
arose
are
exceedingly
clear.
they're
these
the
arkansas
flooring
company
was
engaged
in
manufacturing
oak
flooring.
it
had
a
principal
office
in
pine
bluff,
arkansas
and
a
plant
in
alexandria,
louisiana.
they
bought
some
of
their
lumber
in
texas,
20%.
they
shipped
90%
of
the
finished
product
in
interstate
commerce.
it
was
admitted
during
the
trial
that
they
were
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
the
arkansas
flooring
company
had
been
in
business
for
about
25
years,
but
the
four
years
preceding
the
trial
date
they
had
not
had
a
union
at
the
plant
in
alexandria.
along
in
november
and
december
of
1953,
a
representative
of
the
district
50
united
mine
workers
of
america
came
to
alexandria,
organized
the
employees
and
got
membership
cards.
the
employees
in
the
plant
number
225,
membership
cards
were
signed
by
a
174.
the
union
was
organized,
stewards
were
elected
and
they
asked
this
representative
of
the
united
mine
workers
to
go
to
the
plant
manager
and
ask
for
recognition.
he
went
to
a
mr.
fowler
who
was
in
charge
of
the
plant
at
that
time,
the
man
over
him
was
away.
he
stated
we
represent
the
majority
of
your
employees
and
we
want
recognition.
the
manager
of
the
--
he
showed
the
manager
of
the
plan
his
credentials.
the
man
looked
at
them.
mr.
fowler
looked
at
him
enough
to
see
that
he
represented
the
united
mine
workers
of
america,
district
50.
mr.
crampton
harris
well,
i
don't
know
why
they
put
that
allegation
in
because
it
is
definitely
contrary
to
the
facts.
the
undisputed
evidence
shows
174
cards
had
been
signed
by
employees.
at
the
time
of
the
trial
a
179
had
been
signed.
so
the
facts
of
--
that
developed
on
the
trial
and
those
cards,
two
of
them
are
in
the
record,
a
blank
card
and
a
signed
card
showing
that
a
179
men
out
of
225
had
signed
asking
district
50
to
represent
--
mr.
crampton
harris
yes.
i
think
it'd
be
a
very
different
case.
mr.
crampton
harris
but
i
think
when
they
do
represent
a
majority
and
they
go
to
the
man
and
he
does
not
check
to
see
it
they
have
a
majority,
he
said
you,
the
national
--
you
are
not
recognized
by
the
national
labor
relation
board
and
i
don't
recognize
you
either.
mr.
crampton
harris
but
under
the
language
of
the
weber
case,
if
despite
that
allegation
on
the
trial
the
facts
show
that
there
is
a
majority
then
it
became
the
duty
of
the
trial
court
to
define
to
go
further.
it
--
it
might
be
that
the
allegation
saved
the
petition
from
being
dismissed
on
its
face
without
taking
evidence.
but
when
they
go
ahead
and
take
evidence
and
that
evidence
shows
that
they
did
represent
a
majority
then
as
we
understand
the
weber
case
it
became
the
duty
of
the
state
court
to
abandon
the
proceeding
because
the
policy
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
to
encourage
collective
bargaining.
the
first
--
the
last
paragraph
of
the
first
section
of
the
act
gives
the
employees
full
freedom
of
choice
of
the
designation.
it
uses
full
freedom
of
association
and
of
designation
of
their
representative
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
then
section
7
of
the
act
makes
it
a
protected
right
for
them
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
through
a
representative
of
their
own
choosing.
we
see
that
under
the
undisputed
facts
that
developed
on
the
trial
the
strike
was
an
activity
protected
by
section
13
of
the
act.
so
we
have
a
declaration
of
policy,
we
have
a
method
of
designation
that
is
recognized
and
been
practiced
in
america,
the
card
system,
the
man
didn't
agree
to
check
the
cards.
he
said
you
are
not
recognized
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
i
don't
recognize
you
either.
and
the
representative
said,
we
want
to
talk
to
you
about
that.
he
said,
"not
to
me.
not
to
me."
then
at
that
point
there's
a
slight
dispute.
the
representative
said
--
he
told
us
to
go
--
do
whatever
we
pleased,
the
words
to
that
effect.
the
manager
said,
i
told
him
to
get
in
touch
with
pine
bluff.
he
was
not
positive
as
to
whether
he
told
him
to
call
mr.
nesbit
or
mr.
smith
in
pine
bluff.
the
reasoning
of
the
arkansas,
i
mean
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
was
this
that
you
have
not
been
certified
and
since
you
have
not
been
certified
a
strike
by
a
union
that
hasn't
complied
with
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
is
a
strike
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
he
said
you
can't
be
certified
under
labor
management
relations
act
because
you
haven't
filed
the
reports
and
the
affidavit
and
since
you
haven't
been
certified
and
can't
be
certified,
you
cannot
compel
recognition.
and
that
particular
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
decisions
almost
unanimously
hold
that
full
freedom
of
designation
allows
the
employees
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
to
designate
any
man
they
please,
in
any
way
they
please.
and
under
the
decision
in
hill
against
florida,
if
the
right
of
the
employees
is
full,
they
have
freedom
of
choice
then
their
freedom
of
choice
connotes
or
implies
a
freedom
of
acceptance.
mr.
crampton
harris
only
when
there's
a
--
mr.
crampton
harris
the
--
the
employer
--
mr.
crampton
harris
any
--
any
person,
any
labor
organization
is
eligible
to
be
a
bargaining
agent.
mr.
crampton
harris
a
what
--
a
person.
mr.
crampton
harris
then
if
he
represents
the
majority
of
the
employees
--
mr.
crampton
harris
all
right.
then
the
duty
is
on
the
employer
to
bargain
with
him.
mr.
crampton
harris
not
merely
a
dispute.
it
has
to
be
a
dispute
in
good
faith.
if
the
dispute
is
not
in
good
faith
then
the
employer
would
be
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
crampton
harris
well,
i
don't
--
if
--
if
there
is
no
dispute
the
case
would
--
mr.
crampton
harris
if
there's
no
good
faith
dispute
the
man
is
guilty,
the
employer
is
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
crampton
harris
the
board
cannot
designate
a
bargaining
agent.
all
they
do
is
to
certify
--
mr.
crampton
harris
that's
right.
that's
our
position.
mr.
crampton
harris
no.
there
isn't
any
occasion
for
the
board
to
do
anything
and
a
great
many
cases
are
settled
by
stipulation
without
ever
coming
to
the
board.
the
--
it
wasn't
the
ideas.
we
understand
the
law
to
require
certification
by
the
board.
certification
has
never
been
made
a
condition
precedent
to
representation
so
far
as
we
understand
the
vast
majority
or
the
vast
weight
of
authority.
it
is
a
matter
that
if
they
have
full
freedom
of
designation,
they
can
designate
them
by
cards
or
they
could
use
any
other
method.
and
if
they
have
full
freedom
of
choice
then
their
freedom
of
choice
implies
a
freedom
of
acceptance,
a
right
to
accept.
so
that
we
say
that
what
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
did,
they
trespassed
upon
a
complex
system
established
by
the
federal
government
that
they
misconstrued
the
effect
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
effect
of
the
decisions
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
they
seem
to
imply
absent
certification,
your
effort
to
get
recognition
by
a
strike
is
an
unlawful
object.
well,
if
the
right
to
strike
a
majority
representation
is
protected
by
section
13
and
the
right
of
majority
selection
is
given
by
section
8,
then
under
the
act
the
strike
was
not
for
an
unlawful
object.
it
was
for
a
lawful
object.
and
the
fact
that
he
could
not
the
district
50
couldn't
go
to
the
board
and
get
certified,
didn't
deprive
district
50
of
the
ancient
methods
of
self-help,
economic
pressures
and
they
did
not
in
any
way
trespassed
upon
any
case
that
involves
a
fault
in
the
manner
of
picketing
or
a
defect
or
vice
in
the
objective
picketing.
the
manner
of
picketing
in
this
case
was
absurdly
simple.
there
were
only
three
pickets
at
any
time.
the
only
pickets
were
employees
of
the
company,
they
had
two
signs.
one
said
this
plant
is
on
strike,
the
other
said,
we
want
recognition
district
50
uw8.
at
no
time
was
there
any
violence
or
threats
of
violence,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
such
thing,
it
was
alleged
in
one
phase
of
the
bill
and
then
in
the
alternative
they
said
it
would
be,
we
would
be
unable
to
recognize
them
and
deal
with
them
because
they
haven't
complied
with
section
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
well,
they
were
amending
the
act
of
congress.
the
act
does
not
limit
the
employees
in
a
designation
of
their
representative
to
a
union
that
has
complied
with
the
requirements
or
the
--
docket
--
filing
reports
and
affidavits
specified
in
section
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h).
mr.
crampton
harris
in
order
to
get
the
full
force
in
effect
of
the
arkansas
decision,
it
seems
to
me
if
we
should
consider
for
a
few
moments
the
national
labor
relation
act
and
how
it
has
been
construed
by
the
federal
courts.
that
act
regardless
of
how
men
may
differ
as
to
its
economic
philosophy
was
unquestionly
--
unquestionably
a
long
considered
bit
of
legislation.
to
my
mind
it
is
precision
legislation.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
knew
exactly
what
they
wanted
to
do
and
carefully
proceeded
to
do
it
or
to
try
to
do
it
and
its
important
to
note
that
the
congress
at
no
place
put
in
a
requirement
that
a
union
must
comply
or
file
the
documents
specified
in
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
in
order
to
have
the
right
of
representation.
there
is
as
i
see
it
no
legal
compulsion
on
a
labor
union
to
file
those
documents.
they
had
an
option.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
draftsman
on
the
part
of
the
senate,
the
sponsor
on
the
part
of
the
senate
who
had
mathematics
for
recreation
followed
the
example
of
some
of
the
great
mathematicians.
when
you
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
proving
something
approaching
it
from
one
direction
start
over
again
and
approach
it
from
the
opposite
direction.
and
the
labor
management
relations
act
is
not
a
law
drawn
on
compulsions,
it
did
make
it
unlawful
from
the
failure
to
file.
it
didn't
deprive
him
of
any
right
of
representation.
instead
of
making
it
compulsory
the
statute
is
framed
on
an
inducement
basis.
a
man
isn't
compelled
to
file
a
non-communist
affidavit,
a
labor
union
is
not
compelled
to
file
its
financial
reports.
the
perversions
in
the
law
are
that
if
he
does
not,
if
they
are
not
filed
no
investigation
will
be
made
by
the
board
and
they
will
not
process
a
complaint
made
by
a
union
that
didn't
file
those
papers.
no
forfeiture
of
any
basic
protected
right
under
the
act.
it's
merely
a
denial
of
processes.
the
--
you
might
call
it
as
some
of
the
cases
have
done
a
series
of
benefits
and
determents.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
men
framing
it
avoided
constitutional
questions
by
treating
everybody
alike.
anybody
that
wants
to
come
in
and
get
the
benefit
of
the
processes
of
the
board
can
get
him
by
filing
those
papers.
if
he
doesn't
file
the
papers,
if
the
union
doesn't
file
them
there's
no
penalty,
there's
no
fine,
there
is
forfeiture
in
the
act.
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
way
the
act
is
worded,
you
can
look
at
it
from
the
opposite
direction
that
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
are
limitations
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
they
set
up
this
machinery,
the
congress
sets
it
up
and
says
you
can
do
certain
things
but
here
are
two
things
that
you
can't
do
under
certain
circumstances.
so
when
congress
fail
to
take
make
certification
a
condition
precedent,
i
say
that
that
was
not
accidental.
i
think
every
phrase
in
that
law
requires
careful
study.
now
what
louisiana
did,
it
comes
along
by
this
opinion,
this
ad
hoc
decision
and
adds
a
requirement
to
the
right
of
representation
which
the
federal
law
does
not
impose.
louisiana
says
since
you
cannot
be
certified,
you
cannot
exercise
your
right
protected
by
13
of
the
act
to
strike.
since
you
can't
be
certified
and
i
am
not
recognized
you
can't
compel
anything.
now
if
they
can
come
along
and
add
by
judicial
decision
a
requirement
of
certification
prior
to
representation,
then
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
amended
the
act
of
congress
in
a
basic
point,
on
a
basic
theme
and
we
see
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
garner
case
and
the
weber
case,
said,
we
have
a
clearcut
declaration
of
federal
policy.
the
federal
government
has
declared
certain
things
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
if
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
a
state
cannot
either
by
decision
or
by
statute
invade
upon
the
province
outlined
and
delineated
by
congress
for
this
great
administrative
board.
to
us
it
seems
as
if
congress
having
entered
the
field
and
having
said
we
proscribe
certain
types
of
strikes
that
as
indicated
in
a
paragraph
in
the
garner
case
and
referred
to
again
in
the
weber
case
that
congress
having
entered
this
field
and
having
proscribed
certain
types
of
strikes
would
seem
to
imply
that
other
kinds
of
strikes
are
permitted.
well
now
if
we
are
going
to
have
a
complicated
mechanism
of
solving
the
infinite
number
of
problems
that
will
arise
in
american
labor
relations,
a
machinery
carefully
set
up
by
the
congress
and
then
one
state
can
come
in
and
say
we
will
put
a
requirement
of
certification
in
and
another
state
would
come
in
and
say
as
they
did
down
there,
peaceful
picketing.
no
matter
what
kind
of
picketing
it
was
peaceful
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
getting
recognition
from
the
employer
is
unlawful.
well
if
it's
protected
by
the
federal
act
it's
protected
against
state
intrusion.
the
--
the
question
of
peaceful
picketing,
the
cases
of
hanker
and
gazzam,
those
cases
were
not
as
i
read
cases
involving
a
right
protected
by
the
labor
management
relations
act.
the
--
they
discussed
picketing
and
differentiated
picketing
from
being
the
exact
equivalent
of
free
speech.
but
if
the
picketing
is
in
a
perfectly
peaceful
manner
and
if
its
for
a
lawful
object
then
it
is
protected
by
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
being
protected
the
state
can't
prohibit
it.
as
they
argue
in
the
--
this
court
asked
the
solicitor
general
to
file
a
brief
and
it
does
matter
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
general
as
written
in
their
brief
of
whether
or
not
they
had
certification
if
they
are
exercising
a
protected
right,
if
it's
into
the
field
which
has
been
preempted
by
congress,
then
they
say
that
even
picketing
by
a
minority
would
be
protected.
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
burton
about
the
majority,
there
was
never
in
a
question
of
fact
on
whether
or
not
the
union
had
a
majority.
they
--
they
didn't
refuse
to
deal
with
him
because
they
had
no
majority.
they
weren't
even
willing
to
find
out
if
they
had
a
majority.
mr.
crampton
harris
that's
right.
mr.
crampton
harris
that's
right.
mr.
crampton
harris
that
would
be
bringing
employer
coercion
on
the
--
through
a
labor
union
to
influence
these
other
employees
to
join
the
union.and
that
would
be
covered
and
they
charge
in
paragraph
10.
mr.
crampton
harris
they
charge
what
amounts
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
mr.
mccain
in
framing
his
defenses
from
the
very
beginning,
the
first
thing
he
did
in
his
exception
ratione
materiae
--
ratione
materiae
was
to
say
that
this
was
covered,
his
exceptions
to
the
jurisdiction,
it
was
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
then
when
he
came
to
his
return
to
the
rule
in
his
answer
he
added
the
additional
averment
that
it
was
not
only
in
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
but
he
also
added
to
the
averment
that
it
was
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
and
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
find,
no
case
has
presented
this
question
as
clearly
and
succinctly
as
the
facts
of
this
case
presented
to
this
court
today.
mr.
crampton
harris
in
--
in
this
case?
mr.
crampton
harris
why,
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
have
jurisdiction
if
they
file,
either
party
for
instance
the
district
50
couldn't
file
a
petition
with
him.
but
the
employer
if
he
were
in
any
doubt
could
file
a
petition
and
go
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
further,
we
are
in
compliance
with
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
or
not,
if
we
are
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
crampton
harris
yes,
sir.
and
not
only
they
may
assert
it.
mr.
crampton
harris
yes.
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
they
can't
--
they
can't
get
--
a
state
court
is
not
the
proper
court
to
try
questions
of
unfair
labor
practice.
this
complicated
mechanism
with
a
general
counsel
responsible
for
filing
the
complaints
with
the
board
separated
from
the
trial
examiners,
with
the
board
made
more
judicial
body,
that
is
a
complete
system
for
the
solution
of
labor
problems
by
men
who
are
presumably
expert
and
they
certainly
have
jurisdiction
and
if
--
whether
a
union
is
in
compliance
or
not
they
can
order
them
to
cease
and
desist
from
the
unfair
labor
practices
and
if
they
don't
they
can
go
before
the
court
under
the
procedures
prescribed
by
the
act.
so
we
see
that
louisiana
has
trespassed
upon
the
law,
it's
added
an
amendment
to
an
act
of
congress
and
it
has
deprived
the
labor
board
of
jurisdiction
and
so
far
as
the
record
showed
they
never
made
any
effort
to
see
the
labor
board
about
anything.
mr.
crampton
harris
there
isn't
any
question
of
an
appropriate
unit
in
this
case.
the
case
has
been
tried
--
mr.
crampton
harris
no,
i
--
i
--
mr.
crampton
harris
no.
there's
never
been
any
question
but
what
these
men
would
organize
in
an
appropriate
unit.
it's
never
raised
in
the
lower
court.
it's
never
raised
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
that
these
were
plant
employees
and
if
they
were
not
--
none
of
the
men
who
signed
the
cards
were
clerical
or
other
employees.
there
were
a
174
and
at
the
trail
179
of
the
225
plant
employees.
we
have
no
question
of
an
appropriate
unit.
mr.
crampton
harris
i
was
under
the
impression
that
labor
board
had
the
power
to
decide
where
it
was
an
appropriate
unit
or
not.
i
--
i
thought
they
still
have
that.
mr.
crampton
harris
am
i
wrong
about
it?
mr.
crampton
harris
it
has
been
suggested
by
my
colleague
mr.
cowherd
that
it
--
we
made
a
contract
with
an
employee
and
we
were
outside
the
appropriate
unit
our
contract
would
not
be
a
bar
or
a
protection
to
it.
apparently
that
is
--
that's
the
only
limitation
and
i
defer
it
to
his
far
greater
experience
on
--
in
this
line
of
litigation
than
my
own.
thank
you.
mr.
crampton
harris
we
raise
a
different
argument.
