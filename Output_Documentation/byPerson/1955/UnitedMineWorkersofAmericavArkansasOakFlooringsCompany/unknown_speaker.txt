unknown
speaker
well
mr.
harris,
what
does
the
allegation
mean
in
the
petition
here
that
this
was
done
in
the
absence
of
their
selection
of
the
union
as
their
representative?
didn't
they
allege
that
in
their
petition?
if
they
had
a
174
out
of
222,
i
would
have
thought
they
would
have
selected
their
representative.
unknown
speaker
but
if
they
hadn't
been
able
to
show
that
there'd
been
a
majority
or
a
substantial
number,
that
the
case
would
have
been
somewhat
different,
would
it
not?
if
they
went
before
a
(inaudible)
to
be
recognized
without
having
174
as
they
allege
here
in
their
petition,
you
get
a
different
case
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
might
make
a
difference
as
to
the
jurisdiction
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
might
have
if
there's
an
allegation
then
that
they
had
not
been
selected
instead
of
they
hadn't
selected
their
representative,
might
have
a
bearing
on
the
jurisdiction,
the
national
labor
relation
board
in
a
proceeding
that
is
brought
before
them
as
to
whether
they
were
striking
or
picketing
on
behalf
of
a
selected
representative
or
picketing
on
behalf
of
one
had
not
been
selected
as
they
allege
here.
unknown
speaker
it's
only
when
there
is
dispute
as
to
whether
a
majority
have
chosen
the
bargaining
agent,
that
it
goes
to
the
board.
unknown
speaker
when
there's
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
is
the
provision
of
the
act
that
sets
up
the
bargaining
agent?
anyone
can
come
to
an
employer
and
represent
that
he
is
the
bargaining
agent?
unknown
speaker
or
any
person?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
he
presents
95%
of
the
card.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
only
when
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
whether
he
does
represent
30%.
unknown
speaker
the
board
has
no
function
at
all
unless
a
dispute
arises
in
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
no
--
no
good
faith
dispute.
let's
assume
that.
unknown
speaker
and
the
board
has
no
function
in
it
at
all
except
to
hear
the
unfair
labor
practice.
they
have
no
function
in
regard
to
the
designation
of
the
bargaining
agent.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
at
all,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
a
man
walks
in
and
says
i've
got
a
majority
of
your
employees,
i
am
ready
to
bargain.
and
that
the
employer
must
immediately,
if
he
has
no
good
faith
doubt
as
to
whether
he
does
or
not
sit
down
and
bargain
with
him?
unknown
speaker
and
the
board
has
no
function
to
perform?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
section?
is
that
a
section
of
the
act?
what
was
that?
unknown
speaker
how
--
how
do
you
--
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
--
do
you
object
to
the
representative
of
the
board
saying
that
(inaudible)
they
have
--
don't
they
have
to
go
to
the
board
then?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
about
9
(c)
--
9
(c)
of
the
act?
whenever
a
petition
shall
have
been
filed,
according
to
such
regulation
it'd
be
described
by
the
board
by
an
employer
alleging
that
one
or
more
individuals
or
labor
organizations
had
presented
to
him
a
claim
to
be
recognized,
the
board
shall
investigate
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
they
might
not
call
it,
but
they
have
to
decide
it,
where
do
you
discuss
that?
unknown
speaker
what
--
what
are
you
looking
for?
unknown
speaker
a
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
that
wasn't
the
question
that
i
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
you
go
to
the
board
and
ask
the
board
in
regard
to
whether
you
have
to
listen
to
his
particular
organization?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
don't
understand
that
well.
they
say
--
unknown
speaker
--
that
they
wouldn't
do
that
but
if
they
said
that
they
would
not
require
you
to
bargain
here
then
that's
a
decision
by
the
board
on
that
question.
unknown
speaker
you
petitioned
the
board
so
that
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
but
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
reads
by
an
employer,
alleging
that
one
or
more
individuals
can
present
to
him
a
claim
to
be
recognized
as
a
representative.
(inaudible)
section
9
(a),
the
board
shall
investigate
certain
petitions.
unknown
speaker
when
you
take
the
position
as
you
do
in
that
paragraph
10
that
is
referred
to
of
your
petition
in
the
louisiana
court,
that
the
union
is
picketing
without
having
a
majority
then
you
assert
that
they
don't
have
a
majority,
then
you
do
bring
into
--
under
the
board,
under
those
circumstances,
don't
you?
that
is
the
kind
of
a
thing
the
board
can
take
jurisdiction
of.
unknown
speaker
was
that
--
was
--
without
having
selected
the
representative
i
think.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
so,
why,
then
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
have
jurisdiction
and
they
are
picketing
under
those
circumstances,
wouldn't
they
because
that
is
the
--
an
unfair
practice
for
a
labor
union
to
picket
for
recognition
when
they
don't
have
even
the
majority.
unknown
speaker
that's
coercing,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
coercing
the
employer
to
coerce
his
employees
in
violation
of
their
freedom
of
choice
to
come
into
union
when
they
haven't
got
a
majority
to
represent
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
an
intrusion
upon
the
freedom
of
the
other
employees.
unknown
speaker
well
it's
unfair
labor
practice
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
bargaining
agent,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
to
--
now,
go
right
ahead.
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
try
to
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
december
2nd,
1947.
unknown
speaker
december
2nd
--
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
turned
out
that
they
didn't
have
a
majority
with
the
employer's
win,
the
board
could
give
you
relief
without
helping
the
--
the
union.
unknown
speaker
was
this
--
was
this
an
unfair
labor
practice
of
the
employee
coming
there
in
order
to
come
in
and
asking
to
bargain
with
it?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
then
i
assume
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
going
to
say
--
unknown
speaker
--
what
about
8
(b)
--
8
small
b,
big
b
where
it
says
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
force
or
require
any
employer
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
labor
organization,
as
such
labor
organization
has
been
certified
as
the
representative
of
such
employees
under
the
provision
of
section
9,
what's
the
meaning
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
didn't
suggest
that
probably
a
secondary
point
about
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
the
way
that
whole
allegation
--
your
paragraph
10
comes
in
and
says
that
they
were
picketing
without
having
selected
a
representative.
that's
an
allegation
that
in
the
absence
of
a
majority.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
