is
there
anyway
by
which
--
is
there
anyway
by
which
you
can
get
a
ruling
from
the
board
on
whether
or
not
as
you
or
do
not
have
a
majority
under
the
appropriate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
another
words,
the
board
--
the
board
has
ruled
if
it
has
been
on
from
what
you
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
merely
the
union
can
go
before
it
to
compel
it
under
the
--
an
election
and
the
resulting
certification
to
have
the
votes.
but
you
can't
go
before
the
board
and
say
we
are
ready
recognize
this
union
if
they
have
a
majority
of
the
votes.
we
are
not
satisfied
that
they
do
have
it.
we
disagree
with
the
showing
made
for
one
reason
or
another.
and
we
would
like
to
make
an
election.
it's
me
you're
asking
and
not
the
union,
you
don't
have
to
give
them
any
favor
or
disregard
the
statute,
is
that
your
contention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
board
says
that
an
employer
does
not
have
to
have
the
union
--
doesn't
have
to
have
a
certification
in
order
to
say
or
in
order
to
be
--
to
conclude
that
this
is
a
majority
and
therefore
they
represent
the
whole
body
of
workers,
you
agree
to
that,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
pitts,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
pitts,
speaking
for
myself,
i
think
you're
in
a
hard
spot.
if
in
good
conscience,
you're
not
satisfied
they
have
a
majority.
i
am
assuming
that
that
you
are
not
satisfied
that
they
have
a
majority,
but
you
are
ready
to
be
satisfied
by
some
of
our
(inaudible)
method
of
determination.
now
you
say
you
can't
get
that
before
the
board
have
said,
they
can't
certify
a
non-confirming
union,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
about
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
will
be
in
a
different
position
if
the
board
in
it's
response,
the
board
has
no
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
sent
--
whether
to
report
and
then
should
study
it
--
that
offhand,
i
am
little
troubled
by
a
determination
by
the
board
that
because
the
union
can't
come
before
the
board,
the
employer
can't
come
before
it
to
make
sure
what
his
responsibility
in
the
premises
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
board
--
the
board
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
have
anything
to
suggest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
have
to
assume
the
board
(inaudible)
like
the
other
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
that's
--
if
i
may
intervene.
justice
minton,
i
haven't
looked
that
long,
i'm
taking
your
word
for
it,
i
have
a
way
of
taking
the
words
of
lawyers
in
case
it
stands
for
something
and
sometimes
it's
disappointing.
i
take
your
word
that
the
board
has
ruled
that
although
a
non-confirming
union
can't
go
before
it
and
compel
election
that
is
also
true
of
an
employer
no
matter
how
much
good
faith
he
had,
he
can't
go
before
the
board,
so
will
it
be
holding
an
election
to
see
the
majority,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
is
the
ruling
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
to
see
whether
you
went
before
the
board
and
ask
to
reconsider
it,
that's
definitely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
before
the
board
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
75,
national
labor
relation
board,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
have
based
it
on
a
constructive
strategy
as
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
well,
evidently
i
haven't
looked
at
the
government's
brief
(inaudible)
evidently
the
board's
stand
under
that,
on
page
11,
footnote
4,
the
employer
--
a
union
may
not
have
to
redress
for
the
board,
normally
it
has
some
stages
of
exclusive
representative
verified
by
a
board
certificate.
the
footnote
says,
this
is
so
irrespective
of
whether
the
non-complying
union
is
dealt
by
the
representation
petition,
it
is
filed
by
the
employer
or
the
petition
has
been
filed
by
a
complying
union
and
the
non-complying
union
thereafter
enter
the
--
in
the
proceeding.
and
if
fact,
the
lowenstein
case,
(inaudible)
at
first
the
district
court,
three-judge
court,
and
determined
by
the
second
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit.
apparently
that's
the
province
the
board
on
its
decision
so
that's
established.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
says,
we
--
it
says
in
its
brief,
the
employer
has
other
means
of
ascertaining
whether
they've
got
a
majority,
that
the
employer
has
a
doubt
no
matter
how
honest,
it
can't
be
established.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
--
when
you
recognize
the
body
of
experience,
this
question
in
the
law
that's
determining
whether
they
represented
the
majority
had
not
required
certification
by
the
board,
that
employers
may
act
as
(inaudible)
by
ways
other
than
an
election
and
that
is
by
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
--
let
me
put
it
--
let
me
put
this
to
you,
suppose
an
employer,
i'm
a
putting
a
wholly
hypothetical
(inaudible)
case.
let's
suppose
a
labor
board,
suppose
a
union,
a
conforming
union
asked
for
an
election,
it
sets
forth
that
they
have
--
they
have
and
they
have
that
(inaudible)
the
majority,
has
this
well
known
employer
to
(inaudible)
and
the
employer
puts
in
answer
and
says,
"yes.
that's
true.
we
don't
deny
it.
but
we
to
hold
up
the
union
until
the
board
elections
to
be
had."
that
probably
would
be
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
in
itself
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
ascertaining
whether
you
have
a
majority
by
way
of
board
election
followed
by
a
certification
is
supposedly
is
the
--
by
way
of
determining
a
contestant,
(inaudible)
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
i
understand
that
this
is
contested
by
unions
that
they
represent
a
majority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
mean
in
the
court
but
as
a
matter
of
business
in
good
faith,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
saying
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
see
their
illiteracy
would
become
literacy
even
though
the
board
could
let
them
have
election.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
--
if
the
circumstances,
responsibility
of
their
when
the
board
let
them
have
an
election.
