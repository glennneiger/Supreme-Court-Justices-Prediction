mr.
james
d.
thomas
if
your
honor
please,
the
basic
here
of
louisiana
is
very
apparent
and
i
think
the
chief
justice
in
his
questions
to
mr.
stewart
immediately
hit
upon
the
soft
spot
in
louisiana's
case.
and
just
so
there
won't
be
any
dispute
about
it
and
at
the
very
outset,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
this
question
about
the
thalweg.
the
chief
justice
asked,
mr.
stewart,
what
he
meant
by
thalweg.
mr.
stewart
responded
that
it
was
a
german
word,
meaning,
“valley
way”.
and
your
honor
please,
that
is
the
basis
on
which
louisiana
has
proceeded
in
the
whole
trial
of
this
case
and
their
use
of
words
and
choice
of
language
is
in
direct
conflict
in
its
meaning
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
let
me
give
you
just
basically
the
basis
for
mr.
stewart's
statement
to
the
court
that
it
does
mean
a
valley
way.
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
we
had
gotten
through
many
days
of
--
mr.
james
d.
thomas
it
means,
“valley
way”
is
a
--
mr.
james
d.
thomas
yes,
sir,
and
no
question
about
it
but
it
doesn't
--
mr.
james
d.
thomas
the
word
means
“valley
way,”
your
honor
please,
but
as
used
in
iowa
versus
illinois,
the
term
thalweg
means
the
sit
of
the
navigable
channel
of
the
mississippi
river,
when
is
used
in
boundary
disputes
where
a
navigable
stream
is
the
boundary
between
two
states,
the
boundary
of
the
two
states
is
fixed
to
the
thalweg
of
the
stream.
that
is
to
say
the
middle
of
the
navigable
channel
of
the
stream
and
it
is
not
used
in
an
abstract
sense
as
this
court
used
it
in
iowa.
mr.
james
d.
thomas
that's
right.
it
becomes
a
word
that
it
has
a
legal
meaning
as
it's
defined
by
this
court.
and
when
used
in
its
german
--
germanic
meaning
by
--
as
mr.
stewart
and
his
witnesses
have
done,
it
is
used
in
a
sense
that
it's
in
direct
conflict
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
ever
decided
case.
now,
let
me
show
you
and
illustrate,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
records
and
of
course
we
--
we
have
not
--
ever
had
a
printed
record
served
on
us
in
this
case
so
i
am
reading
from
the
brief
at
page
14,
quoting
from
the
testimony
in
the
transcript.
we
had
gone
along
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
we
were
--
mississippi
was
quite
concerned
as
to
why
we
seem
to
be
--
there
should
be
in
the
confusion
in
the
master's
mind
to
ours
as
to
what
we
were
talking
about.
it
was
quite
apparent
we
--
we're
not
using
the
same
language
and
the
witnesses
did
mean
the
same
thing.
louisiana
introduced
a
mr.
(inaudible),
as
a
geological
expert.
they
introduced
a
mr.
(inaudible)
as
a
geological
expert
and
they
predicated
their
whole
case
upon
that
testimony
and
mr.
stewart
had
predicated
his
whole
argument
here
on
maps
which
were
drawn
at
his
instance
on
this
map
by
these
two
men.
now,
what
did
those
witnesses
state,
by
mr.
mckamy?
“mr.
(inaudible),
will
you
tell
us
your
definition
of
thalweg?”
answer
-
“thalweg,
sir,
is
a
deep
portion
or
zone
of
a
stream.
my
understanding
here
is
that
it's
derived
from
the
german
word
valley
way
and
in
a
stream
therefore
would
have
a
thalweg
by
that
definition.”
do
you
--
you
do
not
refer
it
in
either
way
to
navigation?
“no,
sir.”
so
therefore,
the
--
the
geologists
and
the
attorney,
both
for
the
state
of
louisiana
are
using
words
that
are
--
with
one
definition
when
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
boundary
disputes
has
given
that
word
a
very
distinct
meaning
and
that
it's
--
of
the
louisiana's
used
of
the
word
is
in
direct
conflict
with
that
of
the
supreme
court.
now,
with
mr.
waldo's
testimony
by
mr.
brandon.
“mr.
waldo,
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
term
thalweg?
have
you
studied
a
little
bit
of
german,
sir,
use
the
word
--
use
the
translation
valley
way?”
you
do
not
know
its
definition
then
it
matters
pertaining
to
the
navigation
of
boundaries,
when
it
is
referred
to
in
reference
to
the
application
of
the
thalweg
doctrine.”
“sir,
i
have
never
done
any
research
toward
boundary
of
determination
nor
i
have
been
affiliated
within
the
navigation
on
the
road.
so,
i'm
afraid
i
wouldn't
be
familiar
with
the
thalweg
doctrine.
the
louisiana
is
here
basing
its
case
upon
testimony
of
witnesses
who
are
not
even
familiar
with
the
thalweg
doctrine
and
the
cause
is
advanced
by
louisiana,
it's
predicated
upon
a
theory
made
up
of
that
witnesses
in
contrary
to
the
thalweg
doctrine
as
announced
by
this
court.
now,
further
with
mr.
(inaudible)
testimony.
“you
did
not
concern
yourself
with
the
location
of
that
thalweg
as
it
existed,
as
all
the
approximate
date
of
january
1830
--
january
1933,
shortly
thereafter,
in
an
attempt
to
locate
anything
concerning
boundaries
or
the
fixation
of
the
navigable
channel
prior
to
the
effective
making
of
the
cut-off.”
also,
on
the
thalweg,
in
my
mind,
it
is
a
rather
wide
and
definite
zone
and
i
don't
feel
that
it
can
be
pinpointed.
so,
i
didn't
concern
myself
too
much
with
it
and
that's
how
louisiana
has
treated
the
thalweg
doctrine
as
announced
first
in
this
court
by
in
the
illinois
versus
--
iowa
versus
illinois
and
put
to
rest
in
several
cases
and
probably
the
--
the
best
discussion
of
the
thalweg
doctrine
being
in
the
case
in
new
jersey
versus
delaware.
i
was
somewhat
amazed
to
hear
mr.
stewart
tell
this
court
that
there
was
no
testimony
showing
that
the
island,
south
of
diamond
point,
there
was
no
testimony
to
warrant
its
--
the
master
awarding
it
to
mississippi
and
that
there
was
no
dispute.
now,
he
is
correct
in
saying
that
there
is
no
dispute.
but
when
he
--
he
is
mistaken
when
he
said
that
there
is
a
dispute
that
it
belongs
to
louisiana
because
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record,
not
a
scintilla
to
show
that
that
island
ever
belonged
to
louisiana,
was
ever
formed
anywhere
close
to
louisiana.
now,
what
happened
is
this.when
this
old
channel
south
of
diamond
point,
again
to
deteriorate
after
the
construction
of
the
cut-off
of
1933
by
the
united
states
government
across
the
base
or
neck
of
diamond
point,
the
united
states
government
saw
that
the
main
channel
of
the
river
would
go
through
the
cut-off,
filled
up
the
lower
end
the
river,
fill
up
the
lower
end
of
--
of
the
channel
around
diamond
point
to
stop
the
flow,
to
keep
it
from
being
a
flowing
stream.
and
as
that
channel
deteriorated,
the
island
formed
out
in
the
river
and
formed
to
the
north
of
the
thalweg
of
the
main
navigable
channel
to
mississippi
river,
being
on
the
mississippi
side
of
the
thalweg
of
the
river.
the
main
thalweg
of
the
mississippi
river
was
to
the
south
of
this
island
and
in
due
course
within
a
few
years,
by
the
process
of
accretion
that
became
attached
to
the
mississippi
mainland,
it
is
now
a
part
and
attached
to
the
mississippi
mainland
and
it
always
has
been
on
the
mississippi
side
of
the
thalweg
of
the
mississippi
river.
now,
your
honor
please,
let
me
read
you
so
that
--
so
you
can
see
how
wrong
mr.
stewart
was
when
he
told
you
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
record
to
warrant
the
master
awarding
that
to
mississippi.
this
is
the
plain
testimony
taken
from
the
record.
mr.
mckamy
-
the
main
thalweg
is
south
of
the
island
in
1926,
is
it?”
witness,
and
incidentally,
that
witness
is
(inaudible),
the
man
who
says
that
the
word
thalweg
means
“valley
way.”
so,
when
mr.
stewart
walked
over
here
and
put
his
hand
on
(inaudible)
the
thalweg
was
up
here.
it
was
a
deep
portion
of
the
river.
therefore,
it
was
a
thalweg.
but
gentlemen,
that
has
no
--
that
has
no
legal
significance
and
is
legally
wrong
and
is
in
direct
conflict
what
this
court's
held
in
every
one
of
these
decided
cases.
the
witness,
“i
would
say
that
the
deepest
thalweg
is
south
and
when
the
--
within
the
next
two
years,
this
becomes
the
only
thalweg.”
mr.
clifton
-
“i
think
your
honors
are
entitled
to
an
answer
to
your
question.
was
the
main
thalweg
south?
i
would
like
to
ask
the
witness
if
he
can
understand
that
question
and
answer
it.
by
mr.
(inaudible)
the
thalwegs
are
approximately
equal,
but
i
would
say
that
the
main
fault
and
consequently
the
main
thalweg
at
the
time
that
the
map
is
south
of
the
said
sand
bar.
it
couldn't
be
any
plainer
than
that.
mr.
mckamy
-
“and
becomes
the
sole
thalweg?”
the
witness
-
“eventually.”
mr.
mckamy
-
“have
you
got
a
1933
map
here
that
shows
the
situation.
by
mr.
(inaudible)
“yes,
sir.
we
have
it.
i
can
show
you
very
plainly
on
a
1932
photographs.
they
may
even
be
plainer
at
that
time
to
show
you
the
abandonment.”
mr.
mckamy
-
“by
1928,
it
shifted
way
down
here?”
“yes,
sir.
by
1929,
shifted
into
this
area.
still
further
south
shows
that
thalweg
to
be
cutting
on
this
side,
the
right
bank?”
“yes,
sir.”
the
witness
-
“yes,
sir,
cutting
south
of
that
island
and
by
1902,
sir,
as
demonstrated
on
those
photographs
which
in
louisiana's
exhibit
number
23,
the
area
of
the
sand
bar
that
has
been
discussed,
i
will
mark
it
an
a.
by
that
time,
during
minimal
low
water,
there
is
no
flow
whatsoever
around
the
north.”
mr.
mckamy
-
“in
other
words,
it
became
attached
to
the
left
bank
being
the
mississippi
bank?”
witness
-
“yes,
sir.
by
its
abandonment
of
that
channel
to
the
north,
it's
now
completely
to
the
south.
they
retreated
the
bank
to
the
south
as
been
previously
alluded
to
as
occurring
between
1926
to
1929
and
is
still
continuing
as
can
be
seen
by
the
caving
bank
along
here
from
the
point
between
b
--
blue
and
cyan
blue.
so,
that's
the
channel
that
previously
existed
north
of
the
said
sand
bar
as
for
the
time
of
the
photographs,
louisiana's
exhibit
number
23,
then
completely
abandoned
by
high
water.”
mr.
mckamy
-
“this
is
louisiana's
witness,
the
only
maps
that
you
can
show
that
this
island,
the
first
time
it
appears
on
the
map
shows
its
north
of
the
main
thalweg?”
“yes,
sir,
on
the
1925-1926
map.”
now,
that's
louisiana's
witness
and
yet
louisiana's
counsel
tells
you
that
there's
no
evidence
based
on
master's
finding
that
that
island
is
in
mississippi.
there
is
not
one
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
that
island
was
ever
on
the
louisiana
side
of
the
thalweg
of
the
mississippi
river
and
it's
--
it
has
never
been
anywhere
else.
in
the
charts
of
1918
to
1915
of
the
mississippi
river
commission,
it
doesn't
show
the
appearance
of
any
islands.
and
every
succeeding
chart
it's
published
and
put
out
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
shows
no
islands
at
all
in
the
formation
of
the
river
until
1925
and
on
1925,
it
shows
that
island
appearing
on
the
north
of
the
thalweg
of
the
main
channel
of
the
mississippi
river
and
is
attached
to
the
mississippi
main
island
now
and
is
a
part
of
mississippi.
there
is
not
as
the
special
master
has
found
in
his
report.
there
is
no
testimony
to
show
that
it
is
in
mississippi.
it
is
conclusively
shown
by
dr.fisk,
by
dr.--
by
all
of
the
witnesses
and
every
other
person
that's
testified
in
the
case.
so,
there
can't
be
any
question
of
a
doubt
that
that
island,
regardless
of
whether
mr.
stewart
may
walk
up
to
your
map
and
say,
“look,
i'm
going
to
put
a
map
up
there.
this
is
a
thalweg
up
here.
there's
a
deep
channel
in
the
river
and
that's
a
thalweg.
”that's
not
the
thalweg
that
we're
talking
about
in
boundary
disputes.
it's
not
the
thalweg
that
this
court
described
and
fixed
in
iowa
versus
illinois
being
the
first
case.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
let's
talk
about
just
for
a
moment
the
boundary
around
diamond
point.
mr.
stewart
has
said
all
through
his
argument,
when
a
surrounding
stream
and
the
chief
justice
asked
him
again,
“in
your
state
decisions,
do
they
have
a
thalweg?”
those
decisions
do
not
and
mr.
stewart
answered
back,
“yes,
sir.
they
have
a
thalweg.
every
stream
has
a
thalweg.”
but
we
are
not
talking
about
water
courses
and
the
water
ways
as
the
case
has
cited
in
the
brief
of
louisiana
that's
been
filed
so
recently
in
this
cause.
we
are
talking
about
the
mississippi
river
as
a
navigable
stream
which
forms
a
boundary
between
two
sovereign
states
in
a
given
area.
as
mr.
brandon
has
said,
when
this
case
was
originally
filed,
it
involved
some
25,000
acres
of
land.
and
by
a
process
of
admissions
and
by
process
of
stipulations
on
the
part
of
louisiana,
we've
gotten
down
now
to
a
where
it
only
involved
whether
or
not
a
--
a
dry
bank,
20
feet
above
the
water
is
a
running
stream.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
literally
what
happened
and
that
is
clearly
covered
in
the
master's
report.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that
because
mr.
stewart
and
mr.
lancaster
that's
seated
in
this
room
today
with
what
the
special
master
when
he
took
the
trip
on
--
going
down
to
mississippi
river.
we
went
down
and
all
of
us
went
down
to
mississippi
river
to
see
this
old
abandoned
channel
around
oak
bend.
now,
the
united
states
engineers
built
this
diamond
point
cut-off
to
the
base
of
oak
bend
in
aid
of
navigation
and
flood
control.
and
the
--
when
they
constructed
that
cut-off
channel
in
there
and
took
the
main
body
of
the
mississippi
river
from
the
old
oak
bend
channel
and
placed
to
do
the
oak
bend
channel,
it
fully
occupied
that
channel
by
1936.
all
of
the
navigation
rights
were
taken
out
--
out
of
the
old
oak
bend
channel
and
it
was
closed
to
navigation.
none
--
no
one
--
none
of
the
masters
of
the
boats
were
notified
that
it
was
--
it
was
a
sailing
channel.
they
were
all
notified
that
it
was
no
longer
a
sailing
lane
for
commerce.
they
were
all
notified
up
and
down
the
river
that
the
tows
had
moved
up
and
down
in
commerce,
that
it
was
no
longer
navigable.
mr.
stewart
says,
“what
has
navigation
to
do
with
the
fixing
of
a
boundary?”
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
navigation
is
the
criteria
upon
which
the
fixation
of
a
boundary
between
two
states
in
a
navigable
stream
is
predicated.
now,
the
master
says,
“by
1930
and
certainly
by
1940,
no
water
flowed
in
the
old
abandoned
channel
around
oak
bend,
certainly
at
low
water.”
well,
what
is
(inaudible)
ironically,
that
is
not
beyond
to
--
construe
it
to
say
anything
different
that
we
are
talking
about
the
main
mississippi
river.
we're
talking
about
the
main
mississippi
river
that
forms
the
boundary
between
these
two
states.
we
are
talking
about
the
mississippi
river
that
has
the
thalweg
that's
utilized
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
by
taking
tows
which
the
more
tonnage
is
going
up
and
down
that
river
today
than
ever
before.
when
we
went
down
there,
we
parked
that
(inaudible)
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
we
walked
right
straight
up
the
riverbank
20
feet
high.
and
when
we
got
up
there
on
the
20
--
up
on
--
up
a
bank
20
feet
above
the
flowing
water,
we
looked
out
this
way
and
that
was
a
flowing
river.
and
strange
as
it
might
seem,
two
of
the
biggest
tows
on
the
mississippi
river
passed
through
the
opening
of
--
of
diamond
point
cut-off
at
the
time
we
were
there.
we
looked
back
out
into
this
area
back
into
the
old
channel
of
the
old
deserted
channel
and
what
was
there?
sand,
debris,
a
few
pools
of
stagnant
water.
now,
that
is
what
louisiana
is
saying
to
this
court
that
they're
now
are
contending
as
the
running
stream.
they
are
now
contending
to
you
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
high
the
water
goes
if
a
little
water
can
trickle
and
then
cause
a
little
caving,
it's
a
bank
that
the
boundary
will
be
fixed.
and
that
is
impossible
under
the
law
as
announced
by
this
court.
we
simply
say
to
you,
your
honor
please,
that
this
is
a
report
--
may
i
say
in
my
limited
experience,
one
of
the
finest
reports
of
the
master
that
i've
ever
seen.
it
was
--
it
was
one
of
the
ablest
lawyers
that
i
have
ever
seen
who
was
appointed
by
this
court
as
special
master.
i
never
have
seen
a
court
that
was
presided
over
with
more
dignity
and
grace
and
more
consideration.
one
of
the
finest
reports
i
have
ever
seen.
it's
fully
justified
by
the
evidence
it
introduced
in
this
case
and
we
certainly
say
that
the
master's
report
should
be
confirmed
and
a
decree
entered
accordingly.
mr.
james
d.
thomas
if
your
honor
please,
the
basic
here
of
louisiana
is
very
apparent
and
i
think
the
chief
justice
in
his
questions
to
mr.
stewart
immediately
hit
upon
the
soft
spot
in
louisiana's
case.
and
just
so
there
won't
be
any
dispute
about
it
and
at
the
very
outset,
i'd
like
to
clear
up
this
question
about
the
thalweg.
the
chief
justice
asked,
mr.
stewart,
what
he
meant
by
thalweg.
mr.
stewart
responded
that
it
was
a
german
word,
meaning,
“valley
way”.
and
your
honor
please,
that
is
the
basis
on
which
louisiana
has
proceeded
in
the
whole
trial
of
this
case
and
their
use
of
words
and
choice
of
language
is
in
direct
conflict
in
its
meaning
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
let
me
give
you
just
basically
the
basis
for
mr.
stewart's
statement
to
the
court
that
it
does
mean
a
valley
way.
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
we
had
gotten
through
many
days
of
--
mr.
james
d.
thomas
it
means,
“valley
way”
is
a
--
mr.
james
d.
thomas
yes,
sir,
and
no
question
about
it
but
it
doesn't
--
mr.
james
d.
thomas
the
word
means
“valley
way,”
your
honor
please,
but
as
used
in
iowa
versus
illinois,
the
term
thalweg
means
the
sit
of
the
navigable
channel
of
the
mississippi
river,
when
is
used
in
boundary
disputes
where
a
navigable
stream
is
the
boundary
between
two
states,
the
boundary
of
the
two
states
is
fixed
to
the
thalweg
of
the
stream.
that
is
to
say
the
middle
of
the
navigable
channel
of
the
stream
and
it
is
not
used
in
an
abstract
sense
as
this
court
used
it
in
iowa.
mr.
james
d.
thomas
that's
right.
it
becomes
a
word
that
it
has
a
legal
meaning
as
it's
defined
by
this
court.
and
when
used
in
its
german
--
germanic
meaning
by
--
as
mr.
stewart
and
his
witnesses
have
done,
it
is
used
in
a
sense
that
it's
in
direct
conflict
with
the
language
of
this
court
in
ever
decided
case.
now,
let
me
show
you
and
illustrate,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
records
and
of
course
we
--
we
have
not
--
ever
had
a
printed
record
served
on
us
in
this
case
so
i
am
reading
from
the
brief
at
page
14,
quoting
from
the
testimony
in
the
transcript.
we
had
gone
along
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
we
were
--
mississippi
was
quite
concerned
as
to
why
we
seem
to
be
--
there
should
be
in
the
confusion
in
the
master's
mind
to
ours
as
to
what
we
were
talking
about.
it
was
quite
apparent
we
--
we're
not
using
the
same
language
and
the
witnesses
did
mean
the
same
thing.
louisiana
introduced
a
mr.
(inaudible),
as
a
geological
expert.
they
introduced
a
mr.
(inaudible)
as
a
geological
expert
and
they
predicated
their
whole
case
upon
that
testimony
and
mr.
stewart
had
predicated
his
whole
argument
here
on
maps
which
were
drawn
at
his
instance
on
this
map
by
these
two
men.
now,
what
did
those
witnesses
state,
by
mr.
mckamy?
“mr.
(inaudible),
will
you
tell
us
your
definition
of
thalweg?”
answer
-
“thalweg,
sir,
is
a
deep
portion
or
zone
of
a
stream.
my
understanding
here
is
that
it's
derived
from
the
german
word
valley
way
and
in
a
stream
therefore
would
have
a
thalweg
by
that
definition.”
do
you
--
you
do
not
refer
it
in
either
way
to
navigation?
“no,
sir.”
so
therefore,
the
--
the
geologists
and
the
attorney,
both
for
the
state
of
louisiana
are
using
words
that
are
--
with
one
definition
when
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
boundary
disputes
has
given
that
word
a
very
distinct
meaning
and
that
it's
--
of
the
louisiana's
used
of
the
word
is
in
direct
conflict
with
that
of
the
supreme
court.
now,
with
mr.
waldo's
testimony
by
mr.
brandon.
“mr.
waldo,
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
term
thalweg?
have
you
studied
a
little
bit
of
german,
sir,
use
the
word
--
use
the
translation
valley
way?”
you
do
not
know
its
definition
then
it
matters
pertaining
to
the
navigation
of
boundaries,
when
it
is
referred
to
in
reference
to
the
application
of
the
thalweg
doctrine.”
“sir,
i
have
never
done
any
research
toward
boundary
of
determination
nor
i
have
been
affiliated
within
the
navigation
on
the
road.
so,
i'm
afraid
i
wouldn't
be
familiar
with
the
thalweg
doctrine.
the
louisiana
is
here
basing
its
case
upon
testimony
of
witnesses
who
are
not
even
familiar
with
the
thalweg
doctrine
and
the
cause
is
advanced
by
louisiana,
it's
predicated
upon
a
theory
made
up
of
that
witnesses
in
contrary
to
the
thalweg
doctrine
as
announced
by
this
court.
now,
further
with
mr.
(inaudible)
testimony.
“you
did
not
concern
yourself
with
the
location
of
that
thalweg
as
it
existed,
as
all
the
approximate
date
of
january
1830
--
january
1933,
shortly
thereafter,
in
an
attempt
to
locate
anything
concerning
boundaries
or
the
fixation
of
the
navigable
channel
prior
to
the
effective
making
of
the
cut-off.”
also,
on
the
thalweg,
in
my
mind,
it
is
a
rather
wide
and
definite
zone
and
i
don't
feel
that
it
can
be
pinpointed.
so,
i
didn't
concern
myself
too
much
with
it
and
that's
how
louisiana
has
treated
the
thalweg
doctrine
as
announced
first
in
this
court
by
in
the
illinois
versus
--
iowa
versus
illinois
and
put
to
rest
in
several
cases
and
probably
the
--
the
best
discussion
of
the
thalweg
doctrine
being
in
the
case
in
new
jersey
versus
delaware.
i
was
somewhat
amazed
to
hear
mr.
stewart
tell
this
court
that
there
was
no
testimony
showing
that
the
island,
south
of
diamond
point,
there
was
no
testimony
to
warrant
its
--
the
master
awarding
it
to
mississippi
and
that
there
was
no
dispute.
now,
he
is
correct
in
saying
that
there
is
no
dispute.
but
when
he
--
he
is
mistaken
when
he
said
that
there
is
a
dispute
that
it
belongs
to
louisiana
because
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record,
not
a
scintilla
to
show
that
that
island
ever
belonged
to
louisiana,
was
ever
formed
anywhere
close
to
louisiana.
now,
what
happened
is
this.when
this
old
channel
south
of
diamond
point,
again
to
deteriorate
after
the
construction
of
the
cut-off
of
1933
by
the
united
states
government
across
the
base
or
neck
of
diamond
point,
the
united
states
government
saw
that
the
main
channel
of
the
river
would
go
through
the
cut-off,
filled
up
the
lower
end
the
river,
fill
up
the
lower
end
of
--
of
the
channel
around
diamond
point
to
stop
the
flow,
to
keep
it
from
being
a
flowing
stream.
and
as
that
channel
deteriorated,
the
island
formed
out
in
the
river
and
formed
to
the
north
of
the
thalweg
of
the
main
navigable
channel
to
mississippi
river,
being
on
the
mississippi
side
of
the
thalweg
of
the
river.
the
main
thalweg
of
the
mississippi
river
was
to
the
south
of
this
island
and
in
due
course
within
a
few
years,
by
the
process
of
accretion
that
became
attached
to
the
mississippi
mainland,
it
is
now
a
part
and
attached
to
the
mississippi
mainland
and
it
always
has
been
on
the
mississippi
side
of
the
thalweg
of
the
mississippi
river.
now,
your
honor
please,
let
me
read
you
so
that
--
so
you
can
see
how
wrong
mr.
stewart
was
when
he
told
you
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
record
to
warrant
the
master
awarding
that
to
mississippi.
this
is
the
plain
testimony
taken
from
the
record.
mr.
mckamy
-
the
main
thalweg
is
south
of
the
island
in
1926,
is
it?”
witness,
and
incidentally,
that
witness
is
(inaudible),
the
man
who
says
that
the
word
thalweg
means
“valley
way.”
so,
when
mr.
stewart
walked
over
here
and
put
his
hand
on
(inaudible)
the
thalweg
was
up
here.
it
was
a
deep
portion
of
the
river.
therefore,
it
was
a
thalweg.
but
gentlemen,
that
has
no
--
that
has
no
legal
significance
and
is
legally
wrong
and
is
in
direct
conflict
what
this
court's
held
in
every
one
of
these
decided
cases.
the
witness,
“i
would
say
that
the
deepest
thalweg
is
south
and
when
the
--
within
the
next
two
years,
this
becomes
the
only
thalweg.”
mr.
clifton
-
“i
think
your
honors
are
entitled
to
an
answer
to
your
question.
was
the
main
thalweg
south?
i
would
like
to
ask
the
witness
if
he
can
understand
that
question
and
answer
it.
by
mr.
(inaudible)
the
thalwegs
are
approximately
equal,
but
i
would
say
that
the
main
fault
and
consequently
the
main
thalweg
at
the
time
that
the
map
is
south
of
the
said
sand
bar.
it
couldn't
be
any
plainer
than
that.
mr.
mckamy
-
“and
becomes
the
sole
thalweg?”
the
witness
-
“eventually.”
mr.
mckamy
-
“have
you
got
a
1933
map
here
that
shows
the
situation.
by
mr.
(inaudible)
“yes,
sir.
we
have
it.
i
can
show
you
very
plainly
on
a
1932
photographs.
they
may
even
be
plainer
at
that
time
to
show
you
the
abandonment.”
mr.
mckamy
-
“by
1928,
it
shifted
way
down
here?”
“yes,
sir.
by
1929,
shifted
into
this
area.
still
further
south
shows
that
thalweg
to
be
cutting
on
this
side,
the
right
bank?”
“yes,
sir.”
the
witness
-
“yes,
sir,
cutting
south
of
that
island
and
by
1902,
sir,
as
demonstrated
on
those
photographs
which
in
louisiana's
exhibit
number
23,
the
area
of
the
sand
bar
that
has
been
discussed,
i
will
mark
it
an
a.
by
that
time,
during
minimal
low
water,
there
is
no
flow
whatsoever
around
the
north.”
mr.
mckamy
-
“in
other
words,
it
became
attached
to
the
left
bank
being
the
mississippi
bank?”
witness
-
“yes,
sir.
by
its
abandonment
of
that
channel
to
the
north,
it's
now
completely
to
the
south.
they
retreated
the
bank
to
the
south
as
been
previously
alluded
to
as
occurring
between
1926
to
1929
and
is
still
continuing
as
can
be
seen
by
the
caving
bank
along
here
from
the
point
between
b
--
blue
and
cyan
blue.
so,
that's
the
channel
that
previously
existed
north
of
the
said
sand
bar
as
for
the
time
of
the
photographs,
louisiana's
exhibit
number
23,
then
completely
abandoned
by
high
water.”
mr.
mckamy
-
“this
is
louisiana's
witness,
the
only
maps
that
you
can
show
that
this
island,
the
first
time
it
appears
on
the
map
shows
its
north
of
the
main
thalweg?”
“yes,
sir,
on
the
1925-1926
map.”
now,
that's
louisiana's
witness
and
yet
louisiana's
counsel
tells
you
that
there's
no
evidence
based
on
master's
finding
that
that
island
is
in
mississippi.
there
is
not
one
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
that
island
was
ever
on
the
louisiana
side
of
the
thalweg
of
the
mississippi
river
and
it's
--
it
has
never
been
anywhere
else.
in
the
charts
of
1918
to
1915
of
the
mississippi
river
commission,
it
doesn't
show
the
appearance
of
any
islands.
and
every
succeeding
chart
it's
published
and
put
out
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
shows
no
islands
at
all
in
the
formation
of
the
river
until
1925
and
on
1925,
it
shows
that
island
appearing
on
the
north
of
the
thalweg
of
the
main
channel
of
the
mississippi
river
and
is
attached
to
the
mississippi
main
island
now
and
is
a
part
of
mississippi.
there
is
not
as
the
special
master
has
found
in
his
report.
there
is
no
testimony
to
show
that
it
is
in
mississippi.
it
is
conclusively
shown
by
dr.fisk,
by
dr.--
by
all
of
the
witnesses
and
every
other
person
that's
testified
in
the
case.
so,
there
can't
be
any
question
of
a
doubt
that
that
island,
regardless
of
whether
mr.
stewart
may
walk
up
to
your
map
and
say,
“look,
i'm
going
to
put
a
map
up
there.
this
is
a
thalweg
up
here.
there's
a
deep
channel
in
the
river
and
that's
a
thalweg.
”that's
not
the
thalweg
that
we're
talking
about
in
boundary
disputes.
it's
not
the
thalweg
that
this
court
described
and
fixed
in
iowa
versus
illinois
being
the
first
case.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
let's
talk
about
just
for
a
moment
the
boundary
around
diamond
point.
mr.
stewart
has
said
all
through
his
argument,
when
a
surrounding
stream
and
the
chief
justice
asked
him
again,
“in
your
state
decisions,
do
they
have
a
thalweg?”
those
decisions
do
not
and
mr.
stewart
answered
back,
“yes,
sir.
they
have
a
thalweg.
every
stream
has
a
thalweg.”
but
we
are
not
talking
about
water
courses
and
the
water
ways
as
the
case
has
cited
in
the
brief
of
louisiana
that's
been
filed
so
recently
in
this
cause.
we
are
talking
about
the
mississippi
river
as
a
navigable
stream
which
forms
a
boundary
between
two
sovereign
states
in
a
given
area.
as
mr.
brandon
has
said,
when
this
case
was
originally
filed,
it
involved
some
25,000
acres
of
land.
and
by
a
process
of
admissions
and
by
process
of
stipulations
on
the
part
of
louisiana,
we've
gotten
down
now
to
a
where
it
only
involved
whether
or
not
a
--
a
dry
bank,
20
feet
above
the
water
is
a
running
stream.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
literally
what
happened
and
that
is
clearly
covered
in
the
master's
report.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that
because
mr.
stewart
and
mr.
lancaster
that's
seated
in
this
room
today
with
what
the
special
master
when
he
took
the
trip
on
--
going
down
to
mississippi
river.
we
went
down
and
all
of
us
went
down
to
mississippi
river
to
see
this
old
abandoned
channel
around
oak
bend.
now,
the
united
states
engineers
built
this
diamond
point
cut-off
to
the
base
of
oak
bend
in
aid
of
navigation
and
flood
control.
and
the
--
when
they
constructed
that
cut-off
channel
in
there
and
took
the
main
body
of
the
mississippi
river
from
the
old
oak
bend
channel
and
placed
to
do
the
oak
bend
channel,
it
fully
occupied
that
channel
by
1936.
all
of
the
navigation
rights
were
taken
out
--
out
of
the
old
oak
bend
channel
and
it
was
closed
to
navigation.
none
--
no
one
--
none
of
the
masters
of
the
boats
were
notified
that
it
was
--
it
was
a
sailing
channel.
they
were
all
notified
that
it
was
no
longer
a
sailing
lane
for
commerce.
they
were
all
notified
up
and
down
the
river
that
the
tows
had
moved
up
and
down
in
commerce,
that
it
was
no
longer
navigable.
mr.
stewart
says,
“what
has
navigation
to
do
with
the
fixing
of
a
boundary?”
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
navigation
is
the
criteria
upon
which
the
fixation
of
a
boundary
between
two
states
in
a
navigable
stream
is
predicated.
now,
the
master
says,
“by
1930
and
certainly
by
1940,
no
water
flowed
in
the
old
abandoned
channel
around
oak
bend,
certainly
at
low
water.”
well,
what
is
(inaudible)
ironically,
that
is
not
beyond
to
--
construe
it
to
say
anything
different
that
we
are
talking
about
the
main
mississippi
river.
we're
talking
about
the
main
mississippi
river
that
forms
the
boundary
between
these
two
states.
we
are
talking
about
the
mississippi
river
that
has
the
thalweg
that's
utilized
in
the
commerce
of
the
world
by
taking
tows
which
the
more
tonnage
is
going
up
and
down
that
river
today
than
ever
before.
when
we
went
down
there,
we
parked
that
(inaudible)
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
we
walked
right
straight
up
the
riverbank
20
feet
high.
and
when
we
got
up
there
on
the
20
--
up
on
--
up
a
bank
20
feet
above
the
flowing
water,
we
looked
out
this
way
and
that
was
a
flowing
river.
and
strange
as
it
might
seem,
two
of
the
biggest
tows
on
the
mississippi
river
passed
through
the
opening
of
--
of
diamond
point
cut-off
at
the
time
we
were
there.
we
looked
back
out
into
this
area
back
into
the
old
channel
of
the
old
deserted
channel
and
what
was
there?
sand,
debris,
a
few
pools
of
stagnant
water.
now,
that
is
what
louisiana
is
saying
to
this
court
that
they're
now
are
contending
as
the
running
stream.
they
are
now
contending
to
you
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
high
the
water
goes
if
a
little
water
can
trickle
and
then
cause
a
little
caving,
it's
a
bank
that
the
boundary
will
be
fixed.
and
that
is
impossible
under
the
law
as
announced
by
this
court.
we
simply
say
to
you,
your
honor
please,
that
this
is
a
report
--
may
i
say
in
my
limited
experience,
one
of
the
finest
reports
of
the
master
that
i've
ever
seen.
it
was
--
it
was
one
of
the
ablest
lawyers
that
i
have
ever
seen
who
was
appointed
by
this
court
as
special
master.
i
never
have
seen
a
court
that
was
presided
over
with
more
dignity
and
grace
and
more
consideration.
one
of
the
finest
reports
i
have
ever
seen.
it's
fully
justified
by
the
evidence
it
introduced
in
this
case
and
we
certainly
say
that
the
master's
report
should
be
confirmed
and
a
decree
entered
accordingly.
