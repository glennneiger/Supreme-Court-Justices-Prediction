yes.
which
is

the

here
is
the

it's
not

but
the
avulsion
pushed

pushed
that
out.
unknown

but
was
that

the
diamond
point
before
the
avulsion
was
there,
the
land
--
unknown
speaker
you
--
you
admit
that
before
and
as
i
understood
you,
you
were
saying
that
so
far
as
after
the
avulsion
then
the
diamond
point
was
in
mississippi
at
that
time?
unknown

(inaudible)
had
stayed
there
because
of
avulsion.
unknown

but
then,
do
you
claim
that
that's
part

by

of
--
in

with

at

where
is

--
unknown

prior
to
the

(inaudible)
mississippi's
avulsion
in

territory
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
restrict
that
as
to
all
the
land
in
dispute?
unknown
speaker
that's
because
of
accretion.
unknown
speaker
it
was

well
then,
at

at

(inaudible)
unknown

(inaudible)
unknown

never
demonstrated

what's
that

(inaudible)
as
the

its
presented
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
--
unknown
speaker
--
but
by
a
process
of
the
accretion,
it
came
to
be
in
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
was
there
at
the
time
of
the
avulsion?
unknown

and
everything
that
has
taken
place
since
then
has
been
used
in
the
change
made
by
the
avulsion?
unknown
speaker
changed
the
course
of
the
river?
unknown

there's
been
no
accretion
in
louisiana,
north
and
west
of
the
original
river
channel
prior
to
the
avulsion?
unknown

yes.
unknown

and

and
that

(inaudible)

accrued

did
you

there'd
be

unknown

can
i
just
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
stewart?
was
there
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
on
which
the

found
this
fact?
unknown

well,
do
you
--
do
you
attack
to
this
finding
of
the
fact
here
as
being
clearly
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
based
upon
what
law
or
fact?
unknown
speaker
so,
on

on
your
theory,
there
will
be
no
islands
surrounded
by
land?
unknown
speaker
and
--
and
on
the
louisiana
theory,
they
can
be
islands
surrounded
by
land,
the
state?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown

where
does
mississippi
(inaudible)
thalweg
of

you

what
i
want
to
know
is,
if
you
started
the
mississippi
(inaudible),

how

mr.
stewart,
you
would
say
that
your
thalweg
is
related

no
matter
how
small,
has
nothing
to
do

navigation,
is
that
