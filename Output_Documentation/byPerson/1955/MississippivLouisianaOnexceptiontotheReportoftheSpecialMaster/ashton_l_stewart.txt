mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
boundary
dispute
between
the
states
of
mississippi
and
louisiana.
the
dispute
actually
is
made
up
of
two
separate
areas
involving
two
separate
disputes.
the
first
one
is
what
has
been
spoken
of
in
the
trial
and
in
the
briefs
as
a
diamond
island
towhead
area.
i
believe
i
have
some
charts
here
from
the
offerings
which
will
demonstrate
more
forcefully
than
what
i
can
say
the
point
at
issue.
the
mississippi
river
in
the
1860s
that's
flowing
in
this
manner,
down
here,
originally
as
it's
probably
straight
but
the
point
here
spoken
of
is
diamond
point
was
gradually
built
and
built
it
--
built
out
of
here.
and
somewhere
between
18
--
back
in
1866,
there
was
an
avulsion
that
took
place
that
is
the
water
cut
itself
a
new
channel
through
here
and
left
this
tip
out
in
front.
of
course,
under
the
law,
the
avulsion
did
not
change
the
boundary
with
reference
to
the
ownership
of
this
particular
island
that
remained
in
mississippi.
now,
the
question
here
in
this
particular
dispute
is
where
shall
that
boundary
be?
the
--
this
court
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
in
1918
had
this
to
say
with
respect
to
boundaries
that
are
in
running
streams
between
states.
it
is
said
it's
simply
beyond
the
possibility
of
dispute
that
whenever
a
boundary
is
in
a
running
stream
and
that
stream
is
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
on
one
side
and
accretion
to
the
other
that
the
boundary
continues
with
the
stream
and
is
not
left
behind.
in
that
case,
the
question
there
involved
was
the
exception
to
that
general
rule,
which
is
the
case
of
an
avulsion
when
the
channel
suddenly
takes
another
course
and
leads
or
abandoned
its
former
course.
in
that
case,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
an
avulsion,
the
channel
remains
in
the
former
stream
and
continues
to
remain
there
and
to
be
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
so
long
as
that
old
stream
remains
a
running
stream.
that
is
the
point,
the
interpretation
of
that
very
language
here.
the
special
master
has
cited
the
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
in
his
opinion
and
he
has
read
into
the
language
there
that
since
the
thalweg
or
the
deepest
portion
of
the
channel
is
what
is
meant
in
the
--
all
of
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
as
to
where
the
boundary
would
be
that
when
this
court
used
the
word
so
long
as
this
old
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
the
special
master
has
added
to
those
words
that
so
long
as
that
is
a
running
stream
at
low
water
or
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
added
additionally
and
is
not
subject
to
navigation
at
low
water.
in
other
words,
the
crux
of
this
case
is
what
do
the
word
"running
stream"
mean?
it
is
demonstrated,
i
would
say
very
forcefully
by
this
particular
point
here
which
was
the
point
up
stream
from
the
island
that
the
master
recommended
be
fixed
as
the
upstream
end
of
the
boundary
that
is
going
to
the
main
and
the
old
channel.
this
was
--
this
chart
here
was
made
by
suter's,
chart
made
in
1874
from
a
reconnaissance
of
the
river.
now,
our
position
is
that
if
this
remaining
running
stream
and
if
this,
the
deepest
portion
of
this
old
channel,
the
thalweg
mended
or
was
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion.
by
then,
this
court
has
already
stated
that
that
boundary
was
moved.
i
believe
we
can
better
demonstrate
by
the
next
chart.
this
is
an
excerpt
from
a
mississippi
river
commission
survey,
different
in
some
respect
from
the
suter
reconnaissance.
this
is
the
identical
same
area,
four
years
to
six
years
later.
this
chart
was
finished
on
a
survey
made
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
during
the
years
1878,
1980.
it
obviously
showed
a
channel,
still
running
there
to
the
mouth
of
the
island.
it
obviously
showed
that
some
portion
of
louisiana
here
has
been
built
out.
we
have
superimposed
on
this
chart
since
the
master
has
decided
this
location
of
the
boundary
where
it
should
be
at
the
time
that
low
water
first
ceased
the
flow
to
that
old
channel
and
this
is
it
in
red
line.
it
is
clear
that
that
red
line
goes
across
land.
yet,
the
channel
has
still
moved
on
and
is
still
in
existence
here
at
the
time
of
this
survey
in
1878
and
1880.
to
get
to
the
point
of
issue
here,
what
land
is
being
part
of
that,
we
believe
that
this
chart
will
better
demonstrate
that.
i
can
locate
here
the
last
remnant
of
this
little
island
that
is
right
in
there.
now,
of
course,
the
mississippi
river
through
building
on
this
right
bank
of
the
mississippi
had
pushed
on
down
here.
this
chart
is
in
1937-1938
and
it
has
pushed
on
much
further.
we
used
it
so
the
court
would
not
become
confused
for
the
channel
is
still
here
too,
down
south
of
this
particular
bank.
the
special
master
held
that
this
point
s
was
out
here,
some
mile
and
a
fraction
upstream
from
the
vast
head
of
the
island
as
was
shown
on
this
survey
made
in
1878-1880.
the
master
has
projected
this
line
around
here
and
then
projected
it
down
across
the
accretion
this
way.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
that
line
has
been
erroneously
placed
and
it
should
be
at
the
--
in
the
last
channel
when
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
there
was
no
longer
a
running
stream
around
that
island.
and
if
that
be
so,
this
is
where
louisiana
suggests
that
the
line
should
be
here,
the
streamline
here.
this
therefore
under
this
particular
phase
of
the
case
is
the
land
in
dispute
insofar
as
the
record
is
now
concerned.
originally,
i
might
say
that
when
this
suit
was
first
filed
and
accomplished
in
much
greater
area
of
land,
completely
around
that
way,
i
believe
all
the
down
here
of
many,
many
thousands
of
acres
but
by
stipulations,
it
has
been
reduced
to
this
point
and
the
other
point
that
i
will
discuss
shortly.
now,
we
say
that
a
running
stream
continues
to
be
a
running
stream
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
so
long
--
insofar
as
diamond
point
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
i
can
better
demonstrate
it
here.
diamond
point
is
here.
that
has
been
admitted
by
louisiana
as
being
in
mississippi.
the
island
was
admitted
by
louisiana
as
being
in
mississippi.
we
are
talking
about
the
accretions
that
came
in
and
formed
to
this
right
bank
here.
and
that
is
the
part
that
is
left
and
that
portion
of
the
case
which
we
speak
of
as
the
diamond
towhead
area
and
why
that
particular
name,
i
know
not.
that's
the
way
it
was
--
has
been
spoken
of
historically
and
it's
shown
in
that
manner
on
old
many
charts
and
it
was
used,
been
given
that
name
during
a
hearing
and
still
being
used
in
all
the
briefs.
in
other
words,
the
diamond
point,
louisiana
admitted
that
it
was
a
point
broad
that
was
built
out
from
mississippi.
it
is
that
time
included
at
trial.
subsequently,
the
avulsion
took
place
and
then
subsequently
again,
this
channel
built
on
down
here
moving
this
obvious
point
on
the
way
completely
as
it
was
demonstrated
by
this
next
chart.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
is
north,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
is
diamond
point.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they're
here
--
here
are
the
outline
of
diamond
point
after
the
avulsion
which
cut
off
this
little
island
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
right,
sir,
and
is
still
spoken
of
as
diamond
up.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
we
say
it
was
always
in
mississippi.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
that's
an
avulsion
in
that
land,
remained
in
mississippi,
we
still
stipulate
it
in
this
case.
there's
no
question
about
that.
it's
the
question
of
where
the
boundary
would
be
when
the
current
ceased
to
flow
in
the
channel
that
went
around
the
abandoned
channel,
that's
the
question.
this
court
has
said
it
should
be
where
it
was
when
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
there
was
not
a
running
stream.
the
master
said
that
it
is
not
a
running
stream
when
it
is
not
running
at
some
low
water,
some
particular
state
of
low
water
despite
the
fact
that
it
may
run
as
a
part
of
a
river
in
every
other
state.
and
we
say
despite
the
many
holdings
of
--
in
numerous
cases
of
state
courts
here
in
this
united
states,
i
found
none
from
this
court
that
a
--
a
stream
need
not
be
a
continuously
running
stream.
it
can
be
periodic.
it
can
be
sometimes
dry
in
order
to
continue
to
be
a
running
stream.
i
have
cited
from
12
different
states
here,
i
was
unable
to
find
any
other
adjudication
on
that
point
that
the
--
the
waters
flow
at
least
periodically.
it's
still
a
running
stream
and
the
flow
of
water
may
not
be
constant
is
still
a
running
stream.
containing
running
water
most
of
the
year
is
still
a
running
stream.
that
flow
of
water
allowing
a
regulate
water
course
is
intermittent
does
not
affect
its
character
as
a
water
course.
but
it's
not
necessary
that
there
be
a
continuous
flow.
the
stream
did
not
lose
its
character
as
a
natural
stream
because
in
periods
of
small
rainfall
and
the
water
flowed
in
it.
those
states
are
scattered
over
this
united
states
and
they
are
all
to
the
effect
that
it
has
no
criteria
to
be
a
running
stream
that
they
are
not
--
that
there
be
periods
of
dry,
dryness
when
no
water
flows
or
intermittent
flows.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
thalweg,
sir,
in
my
appreciation,
they're
not
related
to
a
thalweg,
specifically
no,
sir.
but
any
running
stream
will
have
a
thread
or
a
deep
portion,
a
thalweg
in
my
understanding,
interpretative
into
german
means,
a
valley
way.
and
the
valley
way
is
where
the
--
this
court
has
held
the
boundaries
located
when
a
running
stream
forms
a
boundary
between
states.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
--
i
don't
believe
there
are
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
that
would
be
wherever
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
would
say
that
insofar
as
the
necessity
or
requirement
that
there'd
be
a
thalweg
be
concerned
that
is
obvious
even
from
this
chart
that
there
was
a
thalweg
in
there,
in
this
whole
abandoned
channel.
this
chart
was
made
from
the
same
--
well,
it's
possibly
one-third
of
isolation
above
low
water,
mean
low
water
as
i
recall
it.
so,
that's
a
state
would
--
grown
up
to
say
43
feet
above
mainly
low
water
--
main
low
water
for
some
particular
year.
this
one-third
is
approximately
only
14
feet
and
for
many
other
great
portions
of
the
rest
of
the
year,
you
would
have
say
30
feet
of
water
there.
obviously,
it
can
be
navigated.
it
could
be
navigated
at
any
time
that
there
was
sufficient
water
to
ordinarily
provide
the
navigation
and
there
was
sufficient
water
during
many
periods
of
this
particular
year
when
this
chart
was
made
because
this
was
only
one-third
of
isolation.
it
shows
water
in
there.
and
for
the
other
two-thirds
of
the
isolation,
which
was
to
be
spread
over
the
year,
the
rainy
seasons,
why
it
would
be
subject
to
navigation
and
therefore,
of
course
sir,
it
would
have
a
thalweg
and
that
would
be
the
boundary.
the
point
that
i
made
with
reference
to
the
state
decisions
is
that
it
does
not
cease
to
be
a
running
stream
with
a
thalweg
to
say
just
because
there
was
a
month
or
a
day
or
several
months
that
no
water
run
in
the
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
they
have
never
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
--
mentioned
the
word
thalweg.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
said
that
that
they
have
never
mentioned,
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
any
running
stream
that
is
navigable
will
have
a
thalweg
before.
that
is
the
definition
by
this
court,
or
what
a
thalweg
would
be.
it
would
be
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
where
navigation
would
usually
travel
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
could
conceive
that,
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
not
the
same
time.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that'd
be
some
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
a
choice
if
the
--
the
steamboat
people
would
take
all
of
the
--
the
navigable
people
would
take
and
that
would
be
the
valley
way.
it
--
it
is
determined
by
this
court
on
many
occasions
that
it
is
the
main
channel
that
would
be
the
choice
in
case
there
were
more
than
one
or
two,
more
than
two.
our
point
simply
is
that
insofar
as
this
court's
decision
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
is
concerned,
where
it
had
an
exact
situation
such
as
this
that
that
case
is
binding
and
it
should
be
followed
because
it's
bounded
in
logical
reasons,
because
if
for
example,
when
you're
going
to
fix
the
boundary
of
a
stream
at
some
time,
some
particular
space
of
low
water
or
intermittent
flow
are
then
you
are
going
to
abandon
this
proposition
that
this
court
has
said
was
so
firmly
fixed
could
not
be
this
unsaid
and
that
is
that
if
a
boundary
is
in
a
running
stream,
and
that
stream
moved
because
of
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion,
that
boundary
follows
a
stream.
and
therefore,
we
say
that
as
long
as
this
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
it
was
subject
to
erosion
and
accretion.
that's
what
causes
erosion
and
accretion,
the
force
of
the
water
and
that
it
did
move
from
its
old
place
where
it
was
in
1874
according
to
this
previous
chart
to
this
particular
point
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
now
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
lines
on
this
next
chart,
i
should
say
in
its
explanation
of
that,
the
master
has
held
here
that
mississippi
--
contention
is
here
and
that
was
where
the
thalweg
of
the
channel
was
when
the
water
pre-ceased
to
flow
at
low
water.
we
contend
that
it
should
be
here
of
the
eastern
end
of
that
channel
shouldn't
be
here
because
that
was
where
the
water
last
ceased
to
flow.
and
it
ceased
the
flow
approximately
some
time
after
the
1878
chart.
then,
the
remainder
of
this
is
as
a
result
of
the
division
of
accretion,
whoever
owns
the
land
or
fronts
on
where
there
are
accretions,
their
processes
and
theories
under
which
they
are
divided
and
this
line
here
certainly
goes
across
the
accretion
bars
and
this
was
theirs
also.
but
the
main
point
is
where
would
be
--
where
would
that
old
channel
be
as
it
went
around
that
whole
island
and
perhaps
it's
better
demonstrated
from
here
as
to
that.
if
this
old
channel
is
here
as
we
contended
to
be
because
there
is
an
old
channel
there
and
it's
still
on
--
still
flowing
is
obviously
there
because
there's
water
there.
this
is
an
official
chart
of
mississippi
river
commission
and
this
is
where
the
master
thought
that
the
water
ceased
to
flow
at
low
water,
at
least
low
water.
well,
at
this
particular
point,
that
would
be
louisiana
land
here.
if
our
position
is
correct,
it
would
be
mississippi
land
here,
if
mississippi
is
correct.
and
there
is
where
the
main
body
of
those
accretions
were
formed
in
here,
right
there
because
the
river
by
now
is
over
this
location
has
washed
back
this
way.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
think
the
old
shore
lines
are
along
here.
this
is
where
mississippi
held,
it
should
be
where
water
ceased
to
flow
at
the
first
low
water
and
this
--
this
is
the
point
where
louisiana
says
it
just
ceased
to
flow.
the
water
was
no
longer
a
running
stream
there.
these
are
the
accretions
here,
sir,
that
are
in
dispute
and
they
belong
to
this
area
between
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
about
4000
acres.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it's
being
used
for
grazing
timber
and
had
been
in
numerous
(inaudible)
leases
on
it.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
probably
is
the
milk
and
the
coconut.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
river,
sir,
it's
around
here,
over
here
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
--
and
through
here.
this
is
--
this
is
old
diamond
point
here.
in
1933,
they
made
a
shoot
cut-off
or
rather
a
cut-off
(inaudible)
mississippi
river
in.
the
commission,
they
cut
it
through
here
and
you
can
see
that
it's
just
beginning.
it's
just
beginning
to
take
all
of
the
--
the
flow
of
the
river.
that
brings
about
the
next
point
in
this
diamond
island
towhead
area.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
between
1964
and
1966.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
diamond
point,
sir,
diamond
point,
prior
to
the
avulsion.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
that
would
be
an
improper
statement,
sir,
because
the
river
meanders
back
and
forth.
at
one
time,
mississippi
owned
it,
another
time,
louisiana
owned
it.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
depending
on
the
processes
of
accretion
and
erosion.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
this
is
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
before
the
erosion,
the
line,
this
would
be
up
here
and
taken
into
the
island
(inaudible)
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
by
this
particular
chart.
it's
in
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it
means
so
far,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
would
think
so.
no,
sir,
because
the
--
this
particular
stretch
of
the
river
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
--
this
particular
portion
of
the
river
is
a
very
active
portion
insofar
as
those
processes
are
concerned.
originally
sir,
the
--
this
government
township
sections
were
down
in
here,
on
louisiana.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that
part
where
it
built
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
--
this
land
was
here
at
the
time
of
the
avulsion,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
changed
the
course
of
the
river,
yes,
sir,
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
because
this
particular
point
meanders
out
and
cuts
off
all
except
that
little
tip
of
the
top
there
and
goes
over
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
you
mean
in
here,
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
that
was
a
dead
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
oh,
north
and
west
of
that,
yes,
sir.
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
the
channel
insofar
as
this
is
concerned
because
it's
beneath
north
like
that,
no
dispute
that
that
channel
is
in
that
old
water
up
to
about
here
as
you
can
see.
and
then,
the
dispute
starts
that
mississippi
says
that
even
though
this
bar
built
down
that
way
that
nevertheless
that
bar
built
after
the
phrase,
low
water
flowed
through
there.
and
even
though
it
was
built,
this
bar
here
was
built
by
accretion
to
louisiana
shore
but
nevertheless,
it
was
built
after
the
first
low
water
ceased
to
flow
that
therefore
that's
mississippi
there.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
they
--
they
say
that
it's
accrued.
i
would
say
--
it
has
to
say
following
that
accrue
--
accrued
to
the
line
and
not
the
land
because
they
have
to
admit
that
all
of
this
side
of
that
line
is
louisiana.
that
of
course
violates
the
principle
that
this
court
has
so
strongly
adhered
to,
that
if
the
channel
--
if
the
boundary
or
thalweg
is
in
a
river
and
that
river
changes
by
erosion
and
accretion
that
the
boundary
changes
with
the
river.
and
how
can
you
freeze
a
boundary
up
here
on
dry
land
if
you
are
going
to
continue
to
so
hold
that?
and
of
course,
this
court
has
held
at
so
many
times
and
it's
so
logical
in
its
early
review,
it
followed
all
of
the
european
countries
on
that
because
it's
the
great
right
to
the
water
in
front
it.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
this
present
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
present
dispute
goes
over
the
years
of
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
believe
way
beyond
1900
when
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
because
in
those
days,
they
were
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
one
did
know,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
there
were
two
change
of
title,
one
from
louisiana
and
one
from
mississippi.
they
were
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
both
in
louisiana
and
in
mississippi.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
oh
well,
i
shouldn't
say
lay
dormant
because
it
has
been
litigated
over
the
years
and
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
the
last
litigation
commenced
in
1937
in
mississippi
courts.
prior
to
that,
there
was
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it
commenced
on
the
basis
that
the
--
or
claiming
from
louisiana
a
title
to
this
last
litigation.
he
did
live
in
mississippi.
so,
the
mississippi
owners
of
this
--
had
the
mississippi
titles,
they
sued
the
louisiana
owners
who
were
residents
of
mississippi
in
the
mississippi
court
on
an
injunction
on
the
theory
that
we're
going
to
enjoin
from
litigating
over
in
louisiana,
because
the
louisiana
owners
had
sued
the
mississippi
people
in
attempts
of
land
over
and
--
timber
over
in
louisiana
and
it
was
just
a
great
number
of
lawsuits.
the
louisiana
owners
were
attempting
to
recover
in
trespass
for
cutting
timber
on
this
area
here
and
the
mississippi
owners
caught
the
--
louisiana
owners
in
mississippi
and
got
an
injunction
suit
on
them.
we
have
mentioned
some
of
those
here
in
our
briefs.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
that
we
and
it
was
up
to
that
supreme
court
about
four
times
between
1937
and
the
early
years
after
the
war.
that
court
finally
adjudicated
that
they
only
spoke
of
the
island
in
it
--
in
the
decision,
but
the
litigation
was
between
the
people
who
were
on
out
in
the
south
of
the
island
and
the
mississippi
people
here,
whether
the
accretion
to
certain
sections,
you
can
see
some
of
the
lines
here.
and
of
course,
the
decision
was
factual,
going
on
--
on
theory
that
this
line
and
--
at
some
other
reasoning
time
would
not
be
when
the
water
last
ceased
to
flow
in
that
channel.
the
expert
who
testified
for
mississippi
in
that
particular
case
had
testified
that
in
his
opinion,
he
thought
the
boundary
should
be
where
the
water,
just
before
50%
flowed
on
one
of
the
other
channels
and
we
speak
of
it
in
our
brief
as
the
50%
theory.
the
--
that
particular
statement
was
not
--
his
evidence
was
not
covered
in
the
report
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
but
it
affirmed
the
--
the
decision
of
the
chancellor
in
mississippi
and
the
chancellor's
report
based
it
on
that
theory
of
this
particular
man.
they
first
started
this
lawsuit
on
that
theory.
we
say
on
it,
what
we
call
--
they
thought
that
the
boundary
should
be
when
50%
of
the
water
started
crossing
--
more
than
50%
of
the
water
started
crossing
down
the
new
channel.
it's
been
our
opinion
and
position
all
along
that
the
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
was
conclusive
and
that
is
that
it
is
only
when
the
water
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream,
and
that
it
is
still
a
running
stream
even
though
at
some
stages
it
may
not
be
low
water
going
through
that
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
before
1900,
sir
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
more
or
less,
we
have
in
the
record.
i
believe
i
pointed
out
in
the
early
brief
of
louisiana
that
there
needn't
be
afraid
of
the
record
because
so
much
it
involved
such
as
that.
they
have
volumes
of
deeds
and
tax
assessment
rules
showing
that
both
states
were
taxing
the
same
land.
and
both
states
were
claiming
titles
and
the
man
who
had
a
good
title
had
titles
in
both
states.
i
owe
that
particular
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
there
weren't
too
many
taxes
because
most
of
them
paid
the
taxes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
because
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
actually,
from
the
same
man
took
the
change
of
title,
yes,
sir.
the
evidence
will
show
that.
i
have
a
--
that
particular
phase
is
out
in
the
case
because
the
special
master
has
held
that
it
was
too
much
of
that
and
so
therefore
no
one
has
exclusively
possessed
and
the
state
of
mississippi
is
not
accepted
to
that
recommendation.
so,
the
next
problem,
if
there
are
no
other
questions
with
reference
to
this
particular
old
channel
here
when
water
last
ceased
to
flow
involved
actually
the
same
legal
point
and
that
is
where
shall
the
channel
be
fixed
on
the
southerly
side
of
those
accretions?
remember
that
the
channel
was
north
of
diamond
point,
nesting
the
diamond
point
was
here.
that
same
channel
used
to
be
up
here
and
flowing
around
here.
and
then
after
the
avulsion,
it
flowed
around
here
and
has
had
meanders
there
and
to
here.
and
our
point
is,
that
so
long
as
this
channel
has
a
running
stream
in
it,
and
is
subject
to
causing
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
and
subject
to
cause
this
land
or
this
channel
to
meander
while
the
boundary
remains
an
active
boundary
there.
the
special
master
held
that
when
the
water
first
ceased
to
flow
in
this
channel
here,
at
low
water
that
the
boundary
has
been
became
fixed,
despite
the
fact
that
this
channel
may
have
meandered
on
down
considerably,
the
master
spoke
of
a
third
of
a
mile.
i
believe
it's
a
third
to
half
a
mile
on
some
of
the
evidence
that
has
meandered
on
down
here.
in
other
words,
we
can
see
that
from
the
master's
line
here
that
he
stopped
in
the
thalweg
of
this
old
lane
mississippi,
goes
over
and
then
come
down
this
old
channel
which
he
says
was
abandoned
when
the
first
low
water
flowed
through
there
and
then
goes
up.
he
does
not
take
it
through
and
still
in
the
old
channel
which
we
say
continues
to
flow
and
we
believe
is
forcefully
demonstrated
by
two
things
here.
first,
the
position
of
the
mississippi
express
clause
or
on
the
testimony
that
the
water
ceased
to
flow
in
here
for
the
first
time
in
1939,
the
master
states
that
it
ceased
to
flow
in
there.
i'm
trying
to
quote
exactly
his
words
at
least
by
1940.
i
take
it
that
means
the
same
thing.
we
produced
a
photograph
which
showed
that
channel
here
in
1939.
we
had
the
witnesses
mark
it.
i
hope
your
honors
can
see
it.
this
is
the
old
channel
here,
has
the
cut
off
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
the
artificial
cut-off
right
here
made
in
1933.
it
does
not
show
all
of
this
upper
portion
here,
but
this
channel
here,
right
here
is
this
channel
here.
we
submitted
at
that
time
that
that
was
quite
some
channel
and
quite
some
river
to
have
ceased
to
flow
in
the
language
of
this
court
and
become
stagnant.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
it
was
taken
as
my
recollection
as
not
flood
water.
it
was
so
testified,
sir.
we
further
offered
in
evidence
the
water
stages
taken
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
for
the
year
1953
and
had
identified
by
one
of
their
engineers
who
was
an
employee
of
mississippi
river
commission
who
testified
for
them
in
a
private
capacity
that
he
took
the
water
stage
to
the
--
when
water
was
ceased
to
flow
in
here
at
a
stage
of
the
river
at
16.2
feet.
when
water
was
in
this
river
here,
16.2
feet,
it
did
not
flow
in
this
channel
across
here.
but
when
water
rose
above
16.2
feet,
it
did
flow
in
here.
in
accordance
with
this
information
here
form
mississippi
river
commission
as
to
the
depths
of
the
water
there,
we
find
that
this
old
channel
here,
even
in
1953
and
at
the
time
we
tried
this
case
is
with
the
latest
information.
flowed
commencing
on
february,
the
18th
and
19th
continued
for
the
rest
of
february,
all
of
march,
all
of
the
april
all
of
may
and
through
june
the
17th.
the
highest
that
the
water
got
at
any
time
of
any
portions
of
the
river
was
33.52
feet.
so,
it
is
obvious
that
the
difference
between
16th
in
the
fraction
of
feet
is
30
feet,
it
had
that
flow
in
there.
now,
of
course,
it
was
testified
that
1953
was
a
relatively
low
water
flow,
because
as
this
information
is
here
to
the
effect
that
flood
water
is
at
43
feet.
in
other
words,
it
was
still
flowing
through
here
through
this
old
channel
for
--
about
four
months
of
the
year
1953,
and
it
was
considerably
less
than
the
43-foot
flood
stage
as
high
as
three
fifths
and
33
in
a
fraction
feet.
we
also
had
much
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
since
the
master's
had
fixed
the
channel
here,
having
ceased
to
flow
that
it
had
meandered
some
1400
feet,
continued
on
meandering.
therefore,
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
were
in
full
effect.
that,
we
submit
will
take
care
of
the
boundary
around
the
island
and
will
divide
up
the
accretion
because
all
of
this
was
in
louisiana,
but
the
dispute
is
between
these
two
lines
and
there's
no
dispute
on
this
side
of
the
channel
of
the
island.
in
summary,
i
would
just
want
to
say
on
this
particular
part
of
the
case,
that
the
evidence
which
cannot
be
again
said
that
there
was
a
flow
in
that
channel,
as
this
particular
chart
of
the
mississippi
river
commission.
it
was
a
survey.
the
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
disputed
this.
the
theory
that
the
master
got
away
from
that
was
that
no
low
water
was
flowing
through
that
channel
at
the
time
of
this
survey,
but
it
would
be
a
considerable
flow
of
much
water
through
there
subject
to
navigation
at
the
time
this
chart
was
made
since
this
was
only
at
one-third
of
isolation
above
low
water.
and
therefore,
it
was
obviously
and
according
to
the
--
the
data
that
went
with
this
chart,
obviously
that
there
was
a
running
stream
there
and
it's
obvious
that
that
is
what
caused
this
stream
to
move
over
from
this
particular
line
where
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
place
of
low
water.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
record
is
without
any
question,
sir,
the
diamond
point
had
gone
on
and
that
all
of
these
accretions
were
to
the
right
bank.
that's
--
that's
louisiana,
the
right
rescinding
bank.
this
was
never
disputed
that
this
was
louisiana
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
it
all.
i'll
answer
it
the
way
i
believe
i
understand
it,
sir.
the
master
held
and
there
was
no
dispute
that
these
accretions
were
to
the
right
bank
here.
this
was
nothing
but
an
elongation
or
a
projection
of
this
particular
bar
which
has
broken
up
throughout
the
record
as
been
involved.
there
has
never
been
any
dispute
so
far
as
i
know
that
the
accretions
were
there.
the
difference
came
about
that
mississippi
wanted
to
put
the
last
channel
whimr.
ashton
l.
stewart
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
boundary
dispute
between
the
states
of
mississippi
and
louisiana.
the
dispute
actually
is
made
up
of
two
separate
areas
involving
two
separate
disputes.
the
first
one
is
what
has
been
spoken
of
in
the
trial
and
in
the
briefs
as
a
diamond
island
towhead
area.
i
believe
i
have
some
charts
here
from
the
offerings
which
will
demonstrate
more
forcefully
than
what
i
can
say
the
point
at
issue.
the
mississippi
river
in
the
1860s
that's
flowing
in
this
manner,
down
here,
originally
as
it's
probably
straight
but
the
point
here
spoken
of
is
diamond
point
was
gradually
built
and
built
it
--
built
out
of
here.
and
somewhere
between
18
--
back
in
1866,
there
was
an
avulsion
that
took
place
that
is
the
water
cut
itself
a
new
channel
through
here
and
left
this
tip
out
in
front.
of
course,
under
the
law,
the
avulsion
did
not
change
the
boundary
with
reference
to
the
ownership
of
this
particular
island
that
remained
in
mississippi.
now,
the
question
here
in
this
particular
dispute
is
where
shall
that
boundary
be?
the
--
this
court
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
in
1918
had
this
to
say
with
respect
to
boundaries
that
are
in
running
streams
between
states.
it
is
said
it's
simply
beyond
the
possibility
of
dispute
that
whenever
a
boundary
is
in
a
running
stream
and
that
stream
is
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
on
one
side
and
accretion
to
the
other
that
the
boundary
continues
with
the
stream
and
is
not
left
behind.
in
that
case,
the
question
there
involved
was
the
exception
to
that
general
rule,
which
is
the
case
of
an
avulsion
when
the
channel
suddenly
takes
another
course
and
leads
or
abandoned
its
former
course.
in
that
case,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
an
avulsion,
the
channel
remains
in
the
former
stream
and
continues
to
remain
there
and
to
be
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
so
long
as
that
old
stream
remains
a
running
stream.
that
is
the
point,
the
interpretation
of
that
very
language
here.
the
special
master
has
cited
the
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
in
his
opinion
and
he
has
read
into
the
language
there
that
since
the
thalweg
or
the
deepest
portion
of
the
channel
is
what
is
meant
in
the
--
all
of
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
as
to
where
the
boundary
would
be
that
when
this
court
used
the
word
so
long
as
this
old
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
the
special
master
has
added
to
those
words
that
so
long
as
that
is
a
running
stream
at
low
water
or
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
added
additionally
and
is
not
subject
to
navigation
at
low
water.
in
other
words,
the
crux
of
this
case
is
what
do
the
word
"running
stream"
mean?
it
is
demonstrated,
i
would
say
very
forcefully
by
this
particular
point
here
which
was
the
point
up
stream
from
the
island
that
the
master
recommended
be
fixed
as
the
upstream
end
of
the
boundary
that
is
going
to
the
main
and
the
old
channel.
this
was
--
this
chart
here
was
made
by
suter's,
chart
made
in
1874
from
a
reconnaissance
of
the
river.
now,
our
position
is
that
if
this
remaining
running
stream
and
if
this,
the
deepest
portion
of
this
old
channel,
the
thalweg
mended
or
was
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion.
by
then,
this
court
has
already
stated
that
that
boundary
was
moved.
i
believe
we
can
better
demonstrate
by
the
next
chart.
this
is
an
excerpt
from
a
mississippi
river
commission
survey,
different
in
some
respect
from
the
suter
reconnaissance.
this
is
the
identical
same
area,
four
years
to
six
years
later.
this
chart
was
finished
on
a
survey
made
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
during
the
years
1878,
1980.
it
obviously
showed
a
channel,
still
running
there
to
the
mouth
of
the
island.
it
obviously
showed
that
some
portion
of
louisiana
here
has
been
built
out.
we
have
superimposed
on
this
chart
since
the
master
has
decided
this
location
of
the
boundary
where
it
should
be
at
the
time
that
low
water
first
ceased
the
flow
to
that
old
channel
and
this
is
it
in
red
line.
it
is
clear
that
that
red
line
goes
across
land.
yet,
the
channel
has
still
moved
on
and
is
still
in
existence
here
at
the
time
of
this
survey
in
1878
and
1880.
to
get
to
the
point
of
issue
here,
what
land
is
being
part
of
that,
we
believe
that
this
chart
will
better
demonstrate
that.
i
can
locate
here
the
last
remnant
of
this
little
island
that
is
right
in
there.
now,
of
course,
the
mississippi
river
through
building
on
this
right
bank
of
the
mississippi
had
pushed
on
down
here.
this
chart
is
in
1937-1938
and
it
has
pushed
on
much
further.
we
used
it
so
the
court
would
not
become
confused
for
the
channel
is
still
here
too,
down
south
of
this
particular
bank.
the
special
master
held
that
this
point
s
was
out
here,
some
mile
and
a
fraction
upstream
from
the
vast
head
of
the
island
as
was
shown
on
this
survey
made
in
1878-1880.
the
master
has
projected
this
line
around
here
and
then
projected
it
down
across
the
accretion
this
way.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
that
line
has
been
erroneously
placed
and
it
should
be
at
the
--
in
the
last
channel
when
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
there
was
no
longer
a
running
stream
around
that
island.
and
if
that
be
so,
this
is
where
louisiana
suggests
that
the
line
should
be
here,
the
streamline
here.
this
therefore
under
this
particular
phase
of
the
case
is
the
land
in
dispute
insofar
as
the
record
is
now
concerned.
originally,
i
might
say
that
when
this
suit
was
first
filed
and
accomplished
in
much
greater
area
of
land,
completely
around
that
way,
i
believe
all
the
down
here
of
many,
many
thousands
of
acres
but
by
stipulations,
it
has
been
reduced
to
this
point
and
the
other
point
that
i
will
discuss
shortly.
now,
we
say
that
a
running
stream
continues
to
be
a
running
stream
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
so
long
--
insofar
as
diamond
point
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
i
can
better
demonstrate
it
here.
diamond
point
is
here.
that
has
been
admitted
by
louisiana
as
being
in
mississippi.
the
island
was
admitted
by
louisiana
as
being
in
mississippi.
we
are
talking
about
the
accretions
that
came
in
and
formed
to
this
right
bank
here.
and
that
is
the
part
that
is
left
and
that
portion
of
the
case
which
we
speak
of
as
the
diamond
towhead
area
and
why
that
particular
name,
i
know
not.
that's
the
way
it
was
--
has
been
spoken
of
historically
and
it's
shown
in
that
manner
on
old
many
charts
and
it
was
used,
been
given
that
name
during
a
hearing
and
still
being
used
in
all
the
briefs.
in
other
words,
the
diamond
point,
louisiana
admitted
that
it
was
a
point
broad
that
was
built
out
from
mississippi.
it
is
that
time
included
at
trial.
subsequently,
the
avulsion
took
place
and
then
subsequently
again,
this
channel
built
on
down
here
moving
this
obvious
point
on
the
way
completely
as
it
was
demonstrated
by
this
next
chart.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
is
north,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
is
diamond
point.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they're
here
--
here
are
the
outline
of
diamond
point
after
the
avulsion
which
cut
off
this
little
island
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
right,
sir,
and
is
still
spoken
of
as
diamond
up.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
we
say
it
was
always
in
mississippi.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
that's
an
avulsion
in
that
land,
remained
in
mississippi,
we
still
stipulate
it
in
this
case.
there's
no
question
about
that.
it's
the
question
of
where
the
boundary
would
be
when
the
current
ceased
to
flow
in
the
channel
that
went
around
the
abandoned
channel,
that's
the
question.
this
court
has
said
it
should
be
where
it
was
when
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
there
was
not
a
running
stream.
the
master
said
that
it
is
not
a
running
stream
when
it
is
not
running
at
some
low
water,
some
particular
state
of
low
water
despite
the
fact
that
it
may
run
as
a
part
of
a
river
in
every
other
state.
and
we
say
despite
the
many
holdings
of
--
in
numerous
cases
of
state
courts
here
in
this
united
states,
i
found
none
from
this
court
that
a
--
a
stream
need
not
be
a
continuously
running
stream.
it
can
be
periodic.
it
can
be
sometimes
dry
in
order
to
continue
to
be
a
running
stream.
i
have
cited
from
12
different
states
here,
i
was
unable
to
find
any
other
adjudication
on
that
point
that
the
--
the
waters
flow
at
least
periodically.
it's
still
a
running
stream
and
the
flow
of
water
may
not
be
constant
is
still
a
running
stream.
containing
running
water
most
of
the
year
is
still
a
running
stream.
that
flow
of
water
allowing
a
regulate
water
course
is
intermittent
does
not
affect
its
character
as
a
water
course.
but
it's
not
necessary
that
there
be
a
continuous
flow.
the
stream
did
not
lose
its
character
as
a
natural
stream
because
in
periods
of
small
rainfall
and
the
water
flowed
in
it.
those
states
are
scattered
over
this
united
states
and
they
are
all
to
the
effect
that
it
has
no
criteria
to
be
a
running
stream
that
they
are
not
--
that
there
be
periods
of
dry,
dryness
when
no
water
flows
or
intermittent
flows.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
thalweg,
sir,
in
my
appreciation,
they're
not
related
to
a
thalweg,
specifically
no,
sir.
but
any
running
stream
will
have
a
thread
or
a
deep
portion,
a
thalweg
in
my
understanding,
interpretative
into
german
means,
a
valley
way.
and
the
valley
way
is
where
the
--
this
court
has
held
the
boundaries
located
when
a
running
stream
forms
a
boundary
between
states.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
--
i
don't
believe
there
are
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
that
would
be
wherever
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
would
say
that
insofar
as
the
necessity
or
requirement
that
there'd
be
a
thalweg
be
concerned
that
is
obvious
even
from
this
chart
that
there
was
a
thalweg
in
there,
in
this
whole
abandoned
channel.
this
chart
was
made
from
the
same
--
well,
it's
possibly
one-third
of
isolation
above
low
water,
mean
low
water
as
i
recall
it.
so,
that's
a
state
would
--
grown
up
to
say
43
feet
above
mainly
low
water
--
main
low
water
for
some
particular
year.
this
one-third
is
approximately
only
14
feet
and
for
many
other
great
portions
of
the
rest
of
the
year,
you
would
have
say
30
feet
of
water
there.
obviously,
it
can
be
navigated.
it
could
be
navigated
at
any
time
that
there
was
sufficient
water
to
ordinarily
provide
the
navigation
and
there
was
sufficient
water
during
many
periods
of
this
particular
year
when
this
chart
was
made
because
this
was
only
one-third
of
isolation.
it
shows
water
in
there.
and
for
the
other
two-thirds
of
the
isolation,
which
was
to
be
spread
over
the
year,
the
rainy
seasons,
why
it
would
be
subject
to
navigation
and
therefore,
of
course
sir,
it
would
have
a
thalweg
and
that
would
be
the
boundary.
the
point
that
i
made
with
reference
to
the
state
decisions
is
that
it
does
not
cease
to
be
a
running
stream
with
a
thalweg
to
say
just
because
there
was
a
month
or
a
day
or
several
months
that
no
water
run
in
the
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
they
have
never
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
--
mentioned
the
word
thalweg.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
said
that
that
they
have
never
mentioned,
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
any
running
stream
that
is
navigable
will
have
a
thalweg
before.
that
is
the
definition
by
this
court,
or
what
a
thalweg
would
be.
it
would
be
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
where
navigation
would
usually
travel
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
could
conceive
that,
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
not
the
same
time.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that'd
be
some
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
a
choice
if
the
--
the
steamboat
people
would
take
all
of
the
--
the
navigable
people
would
take
and
that
would
be
the
valley
way.
it
--
it
is
determined
by
this
court
on
many
occasions
that
it
is
the
main
channel
that
would
be
the
choice
in
case
there
were
more
than
one
or
two,
more
than
two.
our
point
simply
is
that
insofar
as
this
court's
decision
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
is
concerned,
where
it
had
an
exact
situation
such
as
this
that
that
case
is
binding
and
it
should
be
followed
because
it's
bounded
in
logical
reasons,
because
if
for
example,
when
you're
going
to
fix
the
boundary
of
a
stream
at
some
time,
some
particular
space
of
low
water
or
intermittent
flow
are
then
you
are
going
to
abandon
this
proposition
that
this
court
has
said
was
so
firmly
fixed
could
not
be
this
unsaid
and
that
is
that
if
a
boundary
is
in
a
running
stream,
and
that
stream
moved
because
of
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion,
that
boundary
follows
a
stream.
and
therefore,
we
say
that
as
long
as
this
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
it
was
subject
to
erosion
and
accretion.
that's
what
causes
erosion
and
accretion,
the
force
of
the
water
and
that
it
did
move
from
its
old
place
where
it
was
in
1874
according
to
this
previous
chart
to
this
particular
point
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
now
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
lines
on
this
next
chart,
i
should
say
in
its
explanation
of
that,
the
master
has
held
here
that
mississippi
--
contention
is
here
and
that
was
where
the
thalweg
of
the
channel
was
when
the
water
pre-ceased
to
flow
at
low
water.
we
contend
that
it
should
be
here
of
the
eastern
end
of
that
channel
shouldn't
be
here
because
that
was
where
the
water
last
ceased
to
flow.
and
it
ceased
the
flow
approximately
some
time
after
the
1878
chart.
then,
the
remainder
of
this
is
as
a
result
of
the
division
of
accretion,
whoever
owns
the
land
or
fronts
on
where
there
are
accretions,
their
processes
and
theories
under
which
they
are
divided
and
this
line
here
certainly
goes
across
the
accretion
bars
and
this
was
theirs
also.
but
the
main
point
is
where
would
be
--
where
would
that
old
channel
be
as
it
went
around
that
whole
island
and
perhaps
it's
better
demonstrated
from
here
as
to
that.
if
this
old
channel
is
here
as
we
contended
to
be
because
there
is
an
old
channel
there
and
it's
still
on
--
still
flowing
is
obviously
there
because
there's
water
there.
this
is
an
official
chart
of
mississippi
river
commission
and
this
is
where
the
master
thought
that
the
water
ceased
to
flow
at
low
water,
at
least
low
water.
well,
at
this
particular
point,
that
would
be
louisiana
land
here.
if
our
position
is
correct,
it
would
be
mississippi
land
here,
if
mississippi
is
correct.
and
there
is
where
the
main
body
of
those
accretions
were
formed
in
here,
right
there
because
the
river
by
now
is
over
this
location
has
washed
back
this
way.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
think
the
old
shore
lines
are
along
here.
this
is
where
mississippi
held,
it
should
be
where
water
ceased
to
flow
at
the
first
low
water
and
this
--
this
is
the
point
where
louisiana
says
it
just
ceased
to
flow.
the
water
was
no
longer
a
running
stream
there.
these
are
the
accretions
here,
sir,
that
are
in
dispute
and
they
belong
to
this
area
between
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
about
4000
acres.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it's
being
used
for
grazing
timber
and
had
been
in
numerous
(inaudible)
leases
on
it.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
probably
is
the
milk
and
the
coconut.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
river,
sir,
it's
around
here,
over
here
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
--
and
through
here.
this
is
--
this
is
old
diamond
point
here.
in
1933,
they
made
a
shoot
cut-off
or
rather
a
cut-off
(inaudible)
mississippi
river
in.
the
commission,
they
cut
it
through
here
and
you
can
see
that
it's
just
beginning.
it's
just
beginning
to
take
all
of
the
--
the
flow
of
the
river.
that
brings
about
the
next
point
in
this
diamond
island
towhead
area.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
between
1964
and
1966.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
diamond
point,
sir,
diamond
point,
prior
to
the
avulsion.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
that
would
be
an
improper
statement,
sir,
because
the
river
meanders
back
and
forth.
at
one
time,
mississippi
owned
it,
another
time,
louisiana
owned
it.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
depending
on
the
processes
of
accretion
and
erosion.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
this
is
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
before
the
erosion,
the
line,
this
would
be
up
here
and
taken
into
the
island
(inaudible)
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
by
this
particular
chart.
it's
in
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it
means
so
far,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
would
think
so.
no,
sir,
because
the
--
this
particular
stretch
of
the
river
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
--
this
particular
portion
of
the
river
is
a
very
active
portion
insofar
as
those
processes
are
concerned.
originally
sir,
the
--
this
government
township
sections
were
down
in
here,
on
louisiana.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that
part
where
it
built
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
--
this
land
was
here
at
the
time
of
the
avulsion,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
changed
the
course
of
the
river,
yes,
sir,
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
because
this
particular
point
meanders
out
and
cuts
off
all
except
that
little
tip
of
the
top
there
and
goes
over
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
you
mean
in
here,
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
that
was
a
dead
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
oh,
north
and
west
of
that,
yes,
sir.
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
the
channel
insofar
as
this
is
concerned
because
it's
beneath
north
like
that,
no
dispute
that
that
channel
is
in
that
old
water
up
to
about
here
as
you
can
see.
and
then,
the
dispute
starts
that
mississippi
says
that
even
though
this
bar
built
down
that
way
that
nevertheless
that
bar
built
after
the
phrase,
low
water
flowed
through
there.
and
even
though
it
was
built,
this
bar
here
was
built
by
accretion
to
louisiana
shore
but
nevertheless,
it
was
built
after
the
first
low
water
ceased
to
flow
that
therefore
that's
mississippi
there.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
they
--
they
say
that
it's
accrued.
i
would
say
--
it
has
to
say
following
that
accrue
--
accrued
to
the
line
and
not
the
land
because
they
have
to
admit
that
all
of
this
side
of
that
line
is
louisiana.
that
of
course
violates
the
principle
that
this
court
has
so
strongly
adhered
to,
that
if
the
channel
--
if
the
boundary
or
thalweg
is
in
a
river
and
that
river
changes
by
erosion
and
accretion
that
the
boundary
changes
with
the
river.
and
how
can
you
freeze
a
boundary
up
here
on
dry
land
if
you
are
going
to
continue
to
so
hold
that?
and
of
course,
this
court
has
held
at
so
many
times
and
it's
so
logical
in
its
early
review,
it
followed
all
of
the
european
countries
on
that
because
it's
the
great
right
to
the
water
in
front
it.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
this
present
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
present
dispute
goes
over
the
years
of
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
believe
way
beyond
1900
when
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
because
in
those
days,
they
were
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
one
did
know,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
there
were
two
change
of
title,
one
from
louisiana
and
one
from
mississippi.
they
were
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
both
in
louisiana
and
in
mississippi.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
oh
well,
i
shouldn't
say
lay
dormant
because
it
has
been
litigated
over
the
years
and
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
the
last
litigation
commenced
in
1937
in
mississippi
courts.
prior
to
that,
there
was
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it
commenced
on
the
basis
that
the
--
or
claiming
from
louisiana
a
title
to
this
last
litigation.
he
did
live
in
mississippi.
so,
the
mississippi
owners
of
this
--
had
the
mississippi
titles,
they
sued
the
louisiana
owners
who
were
residents
of
mississippi
in
the
mississippi
court
on
an
injunction
on
the
theory
that
we're
going
to
enjoin
from
litigating
over
in
louisiana,
because
the
louisiana
owners
had
sued
the
mississippi
people
in
attempts
of
land
over
and
--
timber
over
in
louisiana
and
it
was
just
a
great
number
of
lawsuits.
the
louisiana
owners
were
attempting
to
recover
in
trespass
for
cutting
timber
on
this
area
here
and
the
mississippi
owners
caught
the
--
louisiana
owners
in
mississippi
and
got
an
injunction
suit
on
them.
we
have
mentioned
some
of
those
here
in
our
briefs.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
that
we
and
it
was
up
to
that
supreme
court
about
four
times
between
1937
and
the
early
years
after
the
war.
that
court
finally
adjudicated
that
they
only
spoke
of
the
island
in
it
--
in
the
decision,
but
the
litigation
was
between
the
people
who
were
on
out
in
the
south
of
the
island
and
the
mississippi
people
here,
whether
the
accretion
to
certain
sections,
you
can
see
some
of
the
lines
here.
and
of
course,
the
decision
was
factual,
going
on
--
on
theory
that
this
line
and
--
at
some
other
reasoning
time
would
not
be
when
the
water
last
ceased
to
flow
in
that
channel.
the
expert
who
testified
for
mississippi
in
that
particular
case
had
testified
that
in
his
opinion,
he
thought
the
boundary
should
be
where
the
water,
just
before
50%
flowed
on
one
of
the
other
channels
and
we
speak
of
it
in
our
brief
as
the
50%
theory.
the
--
that
particular
statement
was
not
--
his
evidence
was
not
covered
in
the
report
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
but
it
affirmed
the
--
the
decision
of
the
chancellor
in
mississippi
and
the
chancellor's
report
based
it
on
that
theory
of
this
particular
man.
they
first
started
this
lawsuit
on
that
theory.
we
say
on
it,
what
we
call
--
they
thought
that
the
boundary
should
be
when
50%
of
the
water
started
crossing
--
more
than
50%
of
the
water
started
crossing
down
the
new
channel.
it's
been
our
opinion
and
position
all
along
that
the
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
was
conclusive
and
that
is
that
it
is
only
when
the
water
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream,
and
that
it
is
still
a
running
stream
even
though
at
some
stages
it
may
not
be
low
water
going
through
that
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
before
1900,
sir
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
more
or
less,
we
have
in
the
record.
i
believe
i
pointed
out
in
the
early
brief
of
louisiana
that
there
needn't
be
afraid
of
the
record
because
so
much
it
involved
such
as
that.
they
have
volumes
of
deeds
and
tax
assessment
rules
showing
that
both
states
were
taxing
the
same
land.
and
both
states
were
claiming
titles
and
the
man
who
had
a
good
title
had
titles
in
both
states.
i
owe
that
particular
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
there
weren't
too
many
taxes
because
most
of
them
paid
the
taxes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
because
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
actually,
from
the
same
man
took
the
change
of
title,
yes,
sir.
the
evidence
will
show
that.
i
have
a
--
that
particular
phase
is
out
in
the
case
because
the
special
master
has
held
that
it
was
too
much
of
that
and
so
therefore
no
one
has
exclusively
possessed
and
the
state
of
mississippi
is
not
accepted
to
that
recommendation.
so,
the
next
problem,
if
there
are
no
other
questions
with
reference
to
this
particular
old
channel
here
when
water
last
ceased
to
flow
involved
actually
the
same
legal
point
and
that
is
where
shall
the
channel
be
fixed
on
the
southerly
side
of
those
accretions?
remember
that
the
channel
was
north
of
diamond
point,
nesting
the
diamond
point
was
here.
that
same
channel
used
to
be
up
here
and
flowing
around
here.
and
then
after
the
avulsion,
it
flowed
around
here
and
has
had
meanders
there
and
to
here.
and
our
point
is,
that
so
long
as
this
channel
has
a
running
stream
in
it,
and
is
subject
to
causing
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
and
subject
to
cause
this
land
or
this
channel
to
meander
while
the
boundary
remains
an
active
boundary
there.
the
special
master
held
that
when
the
water
first
ceased
to
flow
in
this
channel
here,
at
low
water
that
the
boundary
has
been
became
fixed,
despite
the
fact
that
this
channel
may
have
meandered
on
down
considerably,
the
master
spoke
of
a
third
of
a
mile.
i
believe
it's
a
third
to
half
a
mile
on
some
of
the
evidence
that
has
meandered
on
down
here.
in
other
words,
we
can
see
that
from
the
master's
line
here
that
he
stopped
in
the
thalweg
of
this
old
lane
mississippi,
goes
over
and
then
come
down
this
old
channel
which
he
says
was
abandoned
when
the
first
low
water
flowed
through
there
and
then
goes
up.
he
does
not
take
it
through
and
still
in
the
old
channel
which
we
say
continues
to
flow
and
we
believe
is
forcefully
demonstrated
by
two
things
here.
first,
the
position
of
the
mississippi
express
clause
or
on
the
testimony
that
the
water
ceased
to
flow
in
here
for
the
first
time
in
1939,
the
master
states
that
it
ceased
to
flow
in
there.
i'm
trying
to
quote
exactly
his
words
at
least
by
1940.
i
take
it
that
means
the
same
thing.
we
produced
a
photograph
which
showed
that
channel
here
in
1939.
we
had
the
witnesses
mark
it.
i
hope
your
honors
can
see
it.
this
is
the
old
channel
here,
has
the
cut
off
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
the
artificial
cut-off
right
here
made
in
1933.
it
does
not
show
all
of
this
upper
portion
here,
but
this
channel
here,
right
here
is
this
channel
here.
we
submitted
at
that
time
that
that
was
quite
some
channel
and
quite
some
river
to
have
ceased
to
flow
in
the
language
of
this
court
and
become
stagnant.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
it
was
taken
as
my
recollection
as
not
flood
water.
it
was
so
testified,
sir.
we
further
offered
in
evidence
the
water
stages
taken
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
for
the
year
1953
and
had
identified
by
one
of
their
engineers
who
was
an
employee
of
mississippi
river
commission
who
testified
for
them
in
a
private
capacity
that
he
took
the
water
stage
to
the
--
when
water
was
ceased
to
flow
in
here
at
a
stage
of
the
river
at
16.2
feet.
when
water
was
in
this
river
here,
16.2
feet,
it
did
not
flow
in
this
channel
across
here.
but
when
water
rose
above
16.2
feet,
it
did
flow
in
here.
in
accordance
with
this
information
here
form
mississippi
river
commission
as
to
the
depths
of
the
water
there,
we
find
that
this
old
channel
here,
even
in
1953
and
at
the
time
we
tried
this
case
is
with
the
latest
information.
flowed
commencing
on
february,
the
18th
and
19th
continued
for
the
rest
of
february,
all
of
march,
all
of
the
april
all
of
may
and
through
june
the
17th.
the
highest
that
the
water
got
at
any
time
of
any
portions
of
the
river
was
33.52
feet.
so,
it
is
obvious
that
the
difference
between
16th
in
the
fraction
of
feet
is
30
feet,
it
had
that
flow
in
there.
now,
of
course,
it
was
testified
that
1953
was
a
relatively
low
water
flow,
because
as
this
information
is
here
to
the
effect
that
flood
water
is
at
43
feet.
in
other
words,
it
was
still
flowing
through
here
through
this
old
channel
for
--
about
four
months
of
the
year
1953,
and
it
was
considerably
less
than
the
43-foot
flood
stage
as
high
as
three
fifths
and
33
in
a
fraction
feet.
we
also
had
much
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
since
the
master's
had
fixed
the
channel
here,
having
ceased
to
flow
that
it
had
meandered
some
1400
feet,
continued
on
meandering.
therefore,
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
were
in
full
effect.
that,
we
submit
will
take
care
of
the
boundary
around
the
island
and
will
divide
up
the
accretion
because
all
of
this
was
in
louisiana,
but
the
dispute
is
between
these
two
lines
and
there's
no
dispute
on
this
side
of
the
channel
of
the
island.
in
summary,
i
would
just
want
to
say
on
this
particular
part
of
the
case,
that
the
evidence
which
cannot
be
again
said
that
there
was
a
flow
in
that
channel,
as
this
particular
chart
of
the
mississippi
river
commission.
it
was
a
survey.
the
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
disputed
this.
the
theory
that
the
master
got
away
from
that
was
that
no
low
water
was
flowing
through
that
channel
at
the
time
of
this
survey,
but
it
would
be
a
considerable
flow
of
much
water
through
there
subject
to
navigation
at
the
time
this
chart
was
made
since
this
was
only
at
one-third
of
isolation
above
low
water.
and
therefore,
it
was
obviously
and
according
to
the
--
the
data
that
went
with
this
chart,
obviously
that
there
was
a
running
stream
there
and
it's
obvious
that
that
is
what
caused
this
stream
to
move
over
from
this
particular
line
where
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
place
of
low
water.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
record
is
without
any
question,
sir,
the
diamond
point
had
gone
on
and
that
all
of
these
accretions
were
to
the
right
bank.
that's
--
that's
louisiana,
the
right
rescinding
bank.
this
was
never
disputed
that
this
was
louisiana
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
it
all.
i'll
answer
it
the
way
i
believe
i
understand
it,
sir.
the
master
held
and
there
was
no
dispute
that
these
accretions
were
to
the
right
bank
here.
this
was
nothing
but
an
elongation
or
a
projection
of
this
particular
bar
which
has
broken
up
throughout
the
record
as
been
involved.
there
has
never
been
any
dispute
so
far
as
i
know
that
the
accretions
were
there.
the
difference
came
about
that
mississippi
wanted
to
put
the
last
channel
which
would
stop
those
accretions
there
and
when
the
water
first
ceased
to
flow
at
low
water.
they
want
to
freeze
them
there
despite
the
fact
that
all
of
these
accretions
continued
to
form
to
the
right
bank,
continue
to
form
which
we
contend
as
louisiana
is
set
--
louisiana
up
to
the
redline.
and
there
is
no
reason
for
it
not
to
be
louisiana
pass
the
red
line
unless
the
master
be
correct,
that
is
that
the
accretion
--
that
the
channel
has
ceased
to
flow
when
it
had
no
low
water
flow.
was
that
the
question,
sir?
there
are
a
several
points
here
that
i
--i
don't
believe
deserve
too
much
comment
on
is
the
question
as
to
how
these
accretions
were
to
be
divided
in
--
to
the
owners
of
the
land
fronting
on
the
river
on
that
side
by
meaning
--
speaking
of
owners
i
mean,
the
mississippi
or
louisiana.
the
state
of
mississippi
contended
and
that
they
held
that
they
should
be
divided
by
running
a
line
at
right
angles
to
the
successive
thalwegs
of
the
stream
as
it
moved
away.
louisiana
thought
there
was
no
need
to
contest
that
because
it
is
--
except
louisiana.
there
are
other
theories
in
law
none
by
this
court
that
i
know
of
as
to
how
accretions
are
to
be
divided,
but
since
they
have
accepted
that,
we
will
accept
it.
we
believe
it's
all
right.
now,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
that
part,
i
will
turn
to
the
next
part.
the
next
part
of
the
case
has
been
referred
to
during
a
trial
of
the
case
and
in
various
brief
as
the
diamond
point
area,
and
that
is
filed,
this
diamond
point
in
1913,
as
the
year
we've
just
been
talking
about
up
here.
here's
the
little
island.
you
can
see
it's
up
in
here.
i
am
here.
this
is
the
bottom
end
of
it.
here's
the
little
island
we're
talking
about.
these
are
the
accretions
that
we've
been
talking
about.
now,
the
part
we're
going
to
talk
about
now
is
the
diamond
point,
here.
mississippi
contended
that
we've
already
stated
that
it
built
out
from
louisiana
and
--
from
mississippi
and
where
the
point
falls.
louisiana
admitted
that.
it's
in
the
record
as
a
stipulation.
and
we
admitted
the
diamond
point
was
a
part
of
mississippi.
in
the
stipulation,
however,
we
did
not
admit
what
the
boundaries
of
diamond
point
were.
it
is
obvious
that
we
were
a
complete
(inaudible)
heads
as
to
whether
where
the
boundary
on
the
north
was
because
the
same
legal
proposition
is
applicable
to
the
north
boundary
of
diamond
point
as
it
is
to
the
south
boundary
of
this
diamond
island
towhead
area.
so,
we
did
admit
that
and
we
didn't
admit
any
boundaries
and
because
with
stipulations
that
are
in
the
record.
now,
this
particular
point
has
to
do
with
an
island
that
was
formed
here,
sometime
approximately
in
1925
or
1926.
as
you
can
see
from
this
1913
chart,
the
channel
if
you
examine
closely
and
one
of
the
witnesses
do
this
on
it
which
we
reproduced
was,
“put
the
thalweg
over
here
against
the
north
bank
of
(inaudible)
bin,”
that
they
speak
of
here,
in
the
vicinity
of
where
the
island
first
formed.
the
--
the
question
of
course
is
on
which
side
of
the
thalweg
did
the
island
first
appear?
now,
that
would
determine
whether
it
would
belong
to
louisiana
or
to
mississippi.
if
it
formed
at
this
particular
time
in
1913
is
positioned
here,
it
will
be
obviously
louisiana.
i
must
explain
and
needed
it
to
the
court
that
this
portion
of
the
river
had
jumped
around
considerably,
as
mississippi
as
louisiana.
there
is
no
understanding
that
mississippi
will
all
be
adjacent
to
mississippi
because
you
may
find
some
portion
of
louisiana
separated
all
the
same
way
from
louisiana
and
the
reason
for
that
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
by
land,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
it
would
be
separate
areas
of
the
land,
for
example,
the
southern
point
area
is
separated
in
that
manner.
now,
it
is
louisiana
adjoining
mississippi.
that
of
course
is
brought
about
by
excessive
avulsion
and
--
now
the
part
that
we
want
to
find
out
about
is
where
was
this
thalweg
and
this
island
formed
in
this
channel.
there
is
not
a
sufficient
--
have
information
to
conclusively
show
where
that
is.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
my
argument
on
this
particular
point
is
thoroughly
covered
within
my
brief
and
i
would
prefer
to
save
my
rebuttal
for
the
diamond
point
towhead
area
if
the
court
will
apply.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
clearly,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it's
based
on
obvious
fact
and
conclusions
from
those
found
facts
which
are
all
in
our
opinion,
mississippi
river
commission
charts.
it
would
have
to
be
a
legal
theory
that
would
determine
where
that
island
was
because
there
are
not
sufficient
charts
or
surveys
to
determine
actually
where
the
thalweg
was
when
the
island
was
formed.
briefly,
that
is
the
argument
we
make.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
fact,
the
legal
point
that
we
take
or
the
--
the
fact
that
we
take
that
a
thalweg
stays
on
the
outside
of
the
bank
and
if
it
is
there,
well,
that
is
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
and
that's
where
the
boundary
is.
now,
if
an
island
is
formed
or
if
that
ceases
to
be
the
deepest
channel
because
the
next
time
is
up.
the
next
map
we
have
which
was
the
first
map
that
showed
an
island,
shows
it
here.
we
still
have
a
channel
north
there.
we
still
have
a
channel
south
of
there.
now,
the
channel
through
the
south
of
the
area
is
slightly
deeper,
so
that's
where
the
thalweg
would
be
there
at
the
time
of
1925-1926,
but
we
say
that
the
history
actually
is
not
there
because
the
history
shows
that
that
north
channel
is
a
closing
channel.
and
therefore,
a
closing
channel
shows
that
it
was
the
main
channel.
now,
this
is
the
point
where
we
differ
basically
with
the
master.
as
you
can
see,
the
channel
here
was
the
1913
channel
here.
it
kept
eroding
back
in
here,
as
the
1920
channel,
as
the
1924
channel
right
here.
it
kept
eroding
back
over
here
and
because
of
developments
upriver
from
this
particular
point
suddenly
in
1925
or
1926.
this
channel
ceased
to
be
an
eroding
channel
and
became
--
and
in
creating
a
channel
because
in
1926
back
line
suddenly
comes
back
over
here,
the
1926
bank
line,
the
green
one.
so,
suddenly,
it
has
changed
all
of
its
activities
from
an
eroding
channel
back
and
it
jumped
back
over
here.
and
during
that
interval
of
time,
the
island
formed.
we
say
it
is
logical
that
the
channel
or
the
leading
channel
here,
that's
where
the
thalweg
was
and
that
mississippi
carried
the
burden
of
proof
and
there's
no
evidence
here
against
that
particular
theory.
we
like
to
reserve
the
remainder.
thank
you.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
on
what
i
think
is
the
only
issue
in
the
court,
before
this
court
and
it
is
still
a
legal
form
that
is
on
the
diamond
point
here,
the
diamond
island
towhead
here.
that
point
is
as
this
court
has
held
that
in
a
case
of
an
avulsion,
so
long
as
the
old
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
capable
of
erosion
and
accretion
that
a
boundary
remains
in
that
stream
and
that's
the
only
point
involved
here
and
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
now,
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee,
here
is
the
decree.
i
have
quoted
heretofore
from
the
reasons.
the
decree
in
that
case
is
that
they
have
pointed
a
commission
through
--
get
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
erosions
and
accretions
that
occurred
in
the
old
channel
prior
to
its
abandonment
by
the
current
as
a
result
of
the
avulsion
in
1876.
and
the
question
whether
it
is
practical
now
to
locate
accurately
the
line
of
the
river
as
it
been
running.
in
other
words,
they
appointed
a
commission
to
find
out
what
happened
to
the
old
channel
by
locating
the
erosions
and
the
accretions.
they
spoke
nothing
of
any
low
water
channel.
a
running
stream
is
a
running
stream
whether
it
has
low
water
running
stream
or
not,
so
long
as
it
continuously
running,
has
a
bed
on
the
sides
and
banks
and
it
conveys
water
in
a
channel
that
are
--
is
usually
in
customary
for
example.
therefore,
the
only
question
on
this
point
that
we
--
hear
the
argument
of
that
is.
when
does
a
stream
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream?
we
say
that
this
court
has
said
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee,
it's
when
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
have
ceased
and
the
water
is
stagnant.
that
it
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream.
those
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
take
place
in
a
running
stream
that
do
not
take
place
otherwise.
so
if
the
court
is
going
to
followup
this
decision
here
which
is
based
on
logic
that
is
if
whenever
a
boundary
is
in
a
stream,
that
boundary
moves
with
the
stream,
we
would
like
to
submit
it
on
that.
we
think
the
briefs
amply
cover
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
--
i
can
spend
considerable
time
to
answer
that.
that
of
course
is
not
my
position,
none
whatsoever,
sir.
my
position
is
exactly
that
--
what
a
thalweg
is,
it's
the
main
navigation
of
a
stream
--
main
navigational
point.
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
concluded
it
as
a
valley
way.
as
i
say,
that
is
a
side
issue
here.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
before
this
court.
that's
a
play
on
words.
we
say
that
the
only
issue
here
is
when
is
a
running
stream
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream?
and
we
say
that
this
court
has
already
decided
that
point
and
i
say
that
that
is
in
logic.
that
is
following
the
general
theory
that
whenever
a
boundary
is
in
a
running
stream,
that
boundary
changes
with
the
change
of
the
stream
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretions
and
we
don't
believe
we
have
any
question
involved
on
--
that's
even
debatable
actually
if
the
court
will
just
examine
that
case
and
this
chart.
there
was
much
said
just
now
about
whether
--
there
be
no
evidence
to
support
our
statement
that
this
chart
shows
that
this
is
a
running
stream.
we
haven't
showed
that
this
channel
here
at
its
narrowest
point
was
300
feet
wide,
300
feet
wide
and
that's
not
a
channel.
that's
a
survey
channel.
counsel
referred
to
as
a
flow
--
overflow
water.
the
chart
shows
that
it
is
one-third
of
oscillation,
a
stream
(inaudible)
above
low
water
and
that's
about
14
feet,
the
height
of
that
channel
thus
far.
that's
some
30
feet
away
from
high
flood
water.
we
submit
the
case
and
let's
hear
some
answers
to
the
question.
thank
you.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
boundary
dispute
between
the
states
of
mississippi
and
louisiana.
the
dispute
actually
is
made
up
of
two
separate
areas
involving
two
separate
disputes.
the
first
one
is
what
has
been
spoken
of
in
the
trial
and
in
the
briefs
as
a
diamond
island
towhead
area.
i
believe
i
have
some
charts
here
from
the
offerings
which
will
demonstrate
more
forcefully
than
what
i
can
say
the
point
at
issue.
the
mississippi
river
in
the
1860s
that's
flowing
in
this
manner,
down
here,
originally
as
it's
probably
straight
but
the
point
here
spoken
of
is
diamond
point
was
gradually
built
and
built
it
--
built
out
of
here.
and
somewhere
between
18
--
back
in
1866,
there
was
an
avulsion
that
took
place
that
is
the
water
cut
itself
a
new
channel
through
here
and
left
this
tip
out
in
front.
of
course,
under
the
law,
the
avulsion
did
not
change
the
boundary
with
reference
to
the
ownership
of
this
particular
island
that
remained
in
mississippi.
now,
the
question
here
in
this
particular
dispute
is
where
shall
that
boundary
be?
the
--
this
court
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
in
1918
had
this
to
say
with
respect
to
boundaries
that
are
in
running
streams
between
states.
it
is
said
it's
simply
beyond
the
possibility
of
dispute
that
whenever
a
boundary
is
in
a
running
stream
and
that
stream
is
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
on
one
side
and
accretion
to
the
other
that
the
boundary
continues
with
the
stream
and
is
not
left
behind.
in
that
case,
the
question
there
involved
was
the
exception
to
that
general
rule,
which
is
the
case
of
an
avulsion
when
the
channel
suddenly
takes
another
course
and
leads
or
abandoned
its
former
course.
in
that
case,
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
in
the
case
of
an
avulsion,
the
channel
remains
in
the
former
stream
and
continues
to
remain
there
and
to
be
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
so
long
as
that
old
stream
remains
a
running
stream.
that
is
the
point,
the
interpretation
of
that
very
language
here.
the
special
master
has
cited
the
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
in
his
opinion
and
he
has
read
into
the
language
there
that
since
the
thalweg
or
the
deepest
portion
of
the
channel
is
what
is
meant
in
the
--
all
of
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
as
to
where
the
boundary
would
be
that
when
this
court
used
the
word
so
long
as
this
old
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
the
special
master
has
added
to
those
words
that
so
long
as
that
is
a
running
stream
at
low
water
or
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
added
additionally
and
is
not
subject
to
navigation
at
low
water.
in
other
words,
the
crux
of
this
case
is
what
do
the
word
"running
stream"
mean?
it
is
demonstrated,
i
would
say
very
forcefully
by
this
particular
point
here
which
was
the
point
up
stream
from
the
island
that
the
master
recommended
be
fixed
as
the
upstream
end
of
the
boundary
that
is
going
to
the
main
and
the
old
channel.
this
was
--
this
chart
here
was
made
by
suter's,
chart
made
in
1874
from
a
reconnaissance
of
the
river.
now,
our
position
is
that
if
this
remaining
running
stream
and
if
this,
the
deepest
portion
of
this
old
channel,
the
thalweg
mended
or
was
moved
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion.
by
then,
this
court
has
already
stated
that
that
boundary
was
moved.
i
believe
we
can
better
demonstrate
by
the
next
chart.
this
is
an
excerpt
from
a
mississippi
river
commission
survey,
different
in
some
respect
from
the
suter
reconnaissance.
this
is
the
identical
same
area,
four
years
to
six
years
later.
this
chart
was
finished
on
a
survey
made
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
during
the
years
1878,
1980.
it
obviously
showed
a
channel,
still
running
there
to
the
mouth
of
the
island.
it
obviously
showed
that
some
portion
of
louisiana
here
has
been
built
out.
we
have
superimposed
on
this
chart
since
the
master
has
decided
this
location
of
the
boundary
where
it
should
be
at
the
time
that
low
water
first
ceased
the
flow
to
that
old
channel
and
this
is
it
in
red
line.
it
is
clear
that
that
red
line
goes
across
land.
yet,
the
channel
has
still
moved
on
and
is
still
in
existence
here
at
the
time
of
this
survey
in
1878
and
1880.
to
get
to
the
point
of
issue
here,
what
land
is
being
part
of
that,
we
believe
that
this
chart
will
better
demonstrate
that.
i
can
locate
here
the
last
remnant
of
this
little
island
that
is
right
in
there.
now,
of
course,
the
mississippi
river
through
building
on
this
right
bank
of
the
mississippi
had
pushed
on
down
here.
this
chart
is
in
1937-1938
and
it
has
pushed
on
much
further.
we
used
it
so
the
court
would
not
become
confused
for
the
channel
is
still
here
too,
down
south
of
this
particular
bank.
the
special
master
held
that
this
point
s
was
out
here,
some
mile
and
a
fraction
upstream
from
the
vast
head
of
the
island
as
was
shown
on
this
survey
made
in
1878-1880.
the
master
has
projected
this
line
around
here
and
then
projected
it
down
across
the
accretion
this
way.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
that
line
has
been
erroneously
placed
and
it
should
be
at
the
--
in
the
last
channel
when
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
there
was
no
longer
a
running
stream
around
that
island.
and
if
that
be
so,
this
is
where
louisiana
suggests
that
the
line
should
be
here,
the
streamline
here.
this
therefore
under
this
particular
phase
of
the
case
is
the
land
in
dispute
insofar
as
the
record
is
now
concerned.
originally,
i
might
say
that
when
this
suit
was
first
filed
and
accomplished
in
much
greater
area
of
land,
completely
around
that
way,
i
believe
all
the
down
here
of
many,
many
thousands
of
acres
but
by
stipulations,
it
has
been
reduced
to
this
point
and
the
other
point
that
i
will
discuss
shortly.
now,
we
say
that
a
running
stream
continues
to
be
a
running
stream
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
so
long
--
insofar
as
diamond
point
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
i
can
better
demonstrate
it
here.
diamond
point
is
here.
that
has
been
admitted
by
louisiana
as
being
in
mississippi.
the
island
was
admitted
by
louisiana
as
being
in
mississippi.
we
are
talking
about
the
accretions
that
came
in
and
formed
to
this
right
bank
here.
and
that
is
the
part
that
is
left
and
that
portion
of
the
case
which
we
speak
of
as
the
diamond
towhead
area
and
why
that
particular
name,
i
know
not.
that's
the
way
it
was
--
has
been
spoken
of
historically
and
it's
shown
in
that
manner
on
old
many
charts
and
it
was
used,
been
given
that
name
during
a
hearing
and
still
being
used
in
all
the
briefs.
in
other
words,
the
diamond
point,
louisiana
admitted
that
it
was
a
point
broad
that
was
built
out
from
mississippi.
it
is
that
time
included
at
trial.
subsequently,
the
avulsion
took
place
and
then
subsequently
again,
this
channel
built
on
down
here
moving
this
obvious
point
on
the
way
completely
as
it
was
demonstrated
by
this
next
chart.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
is
north,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
is
diamond
point.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they're
here
--
here
are
the
outline
of
diamond
point
after
the
avulsion
which
cut
off
this
little
island
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
right,
sir,
and
is
still
spoken
of
as
diamond
up.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
we
say
it
was
always
in
mississippi.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
that's
an
avulsion
in
that
land,
remained
in
mississippi,
we
still
stipulate
it
in
this
case.
there's
no
question
about
that.
it's
the
question
of
where
the
boundary
would
be
when
the
current
ceased
to
flow
in
the
channel
that
went
around
the
abandoned
channel,
that's
the
question.
this
court
has
said
it
should
be
where
it
was
when
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
there
was
not
a
running
stream.
the
master
said
that
it
is
not
a
running
stream
when
it
is
not
running
at
some
low
water,
some
particular
state
of
low
water
despite
the
fact
that
it
may
run
as
a
part
of
a
river
in
every
other
state.
and
we
say
despite
the
many
holdings
of
--
in
numerous
cases
of
state
courts
here
in
this
united
states,
i
found
none
from
this
court
that
a
--
a
stream
need
not
be
a
continuously
running
stream.
it
can
be
periodic.
it
can
be
sometimes
dry
in
order
to
continue
to
be
a
running
stream.
i
have
cited
from
12
different
states
here,
i
was
unable
to
find
any
other
adjudication
on
that
point
that
the
--
the
waters
flow
at
least
periodically.
it's
still
a
running
stream
and
the
flow
of
water
may
not
be
constant
is
still
a
running
stream.
containing
running
water
most
of
the
year
is
still
a
running
stream.
that
flow
of
water
allowing
a
regulate
water
course
is
intermittent
does
not
affect
its
character
as
a
water
course.
but
it's
not
necessary
that
there
be
a
continuous
flow.
the
stream
did
not
lose
its
character
as
a
natural
stream
because
in
periods
of
small
rainfall
and
the
water
flowed
in
it.
those
states
are
scattered
over
this
united
states
and
they
are
all
to
the
effect
that
it
has
no
criteria
to
be
a
running
stream
that
they
are
not
--
that
there
be
periods
of
dry,
dryness
when
no
water
flows
or
intermittent
flows.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
thalweg,
sir,
in
my
appreciation,
they're
not
related
to
a
thalweg,
specifically
no,
sir.
but
any
running
stream
will
have
a
thread
or
a
deep
portion,
a
thalweg
in
my
understanding,
interpretative
into
german
means,
a
valley
way.
and
the
valley
way
is
where
the
--
this
court
has
held
the
boundaries
located
when
a
running
stream
forms
a
boundary
between
states.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
--
i
don't
believe
there
are
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
that
would
be
wherever
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
would
say
that
insofar
as
the
necessity
or
requirement
that
there'd
be
a
thalweg
be
concerned
that
is
obvious
even
from
this
chart
that
there
was
a
thalweg
in
there,
in
this
whole
abandoned
channel.
this
chart
was
made
from
the
same
--
well,
it's
possibly
one-third
of
isolation
above
low
water,
mean
low
water
as
i
recall
it.
so,
that's
a
state
would
--
grown
up
to
say
43
feet
above
mainly
low
water
--
main
low
water
for
some
particular
year.
this
one-third
is
approximately
only
14
feet
and
for
many
other
great
portions
of
the
rest
of
the
year,
you
would
have
say
30
feet
of
water
there.
obviously,
it
can
be
navigated.
it
could
be
navigated
at
any
time
that
there
was
sufficient
water
to
ordinarily
provide
the
navigation
and
there
was
sufficient
water
during
many
periods
of
this
particular
year
when
this
chart
was
made
because
this
was
only
one-third
of
isolation.
it
shows
water
in
there.
and
for
the
other
two-thirds
of
the
isolation,
which
was
to
be
spread
over
the
year,
the
rainy
seasons,
why
it
would
be
subject
to
navigation
and
therefore,
of
course
sir,
it
would
have
a
thalweg
and
that
would
be
the
boundary.
the
point
that
i
made
with
reference
to
the
state
decisions
is
that
it
does
not
cease
to
be
a
running
stream
with
a
thalweg
to
say
just
because
there
was
a
month
or
a
day
or
several
months
that
no
water
run
in
the
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
they
have
never
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
--
mentioned
the
word
thalweg.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
said
that
that
they
have
never
mentioned,
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
any
running
stream
that
is
navigable
will
have
a
thalweg
before.
that
is
the
definition
by
this
court,
or
what
a
thalweg
would
be.
it
would
be
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
where
navigation
would
usually
travel
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
could
conceive
that,
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
not
the
same
time.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that'd
be
some
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
a
choice
if
the
--
the
steamboat
people
would
take
all
of
the
--
the
navigable
people
would
take
and
that
would
be
the
valley
way.
it
--
it
is
determined
by
this
court
on
many
occasions
that
it
is
the
main
channel
that
would
be
the
choice
in
case
there
were
more
than
one
or
two,
more
than
two.
our
point
simply
is
that
insofar
as
this
court's
decision
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
is
concerned,
where
it
had
an
exact
situation
such
as
this
that
that
case
is
binding
and
it
should
be
followed
because
it's
bounded
in
logical
reasons,
because
if
for
example,
when
you're
going
to
fix
the
boundary
of
a
stream
at
some
time,
some
particular
space
of
low
water
or
intermittent
flow
are
then
you
are
going
to
abandon
this
proposition
that
this
court
has
said
was
so
firmly
fixed
could
not
be
this
unsaid
and
that
is
that
if
a
boundary
is
in
a
running
stream,
and
that
stream
moved
because
of
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion,
that
boundary
follows
a
stream.
and
therefore,
we
say
that
as
long
as
this
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
it
was
subject
to
erosion
and
accretion.
that's
what
causes
erosion
and
accretion,
the
force
of
the
water
and
that
it
did
move
from
its
old
place
where
it
was
in
1874
according
to
this
previous
chart
to
this
particular
point
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
now
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
lines
on
this
next
chart,
i
should
say
in
its
explanation
of
that,
the
master
has
held
here
that
mississippi
--
contention
is
here
and
that
was
where
the
thalweg
of
the
channel
was
when
the
water
pre-ceased
to
flow
at
low
water.
we
contend
that
it
should
be
here
of
the
eastern
end
of
that
channel
shouldn't
be
here
because
that
was
where
the
water
last
ceased
to
flow.
and
it
ceased
the
flow
approximately
some
time
after
the
1878
chart.
then,
the
remainder
of
this
is
as
a
result
of
the
division
of
accretion,
whoever
owns
the
land
or
fronts
on
where
there
are
accretions,
their
processes
and
theories
under
which
they
are
divided
and
this
line
here
certainly
goes
across
the
accretion
bars
and
this
was
theirs
also.
but
the
main
point
is
where
would
be
--
where
would
that
old
channel
be
as
it
went
around
that
whole
island
and
perhaps
it's
better
demonstrated
from
here
as
to
that.
if
this
old
channel
is
here
as
we
contended
to
be
because
there
is
an
old
channel
there
and
it's
still
on
--
still
flowing
is
obviously
there
because
there's
water
there.
this
is
an
official
chart
of
mississippi
river
commission
and
this
is
where
the
master
thought
that
the
water
ceased
to
flow
at
low
water,
at
least
low
water.
well,
at
this
particular
point,
that
would
be
louisiana
land
here.
if
our
position
is
correct,
it
would
be
mississippi
land
here,
if
mississippi
is
correct.
and
there
is
where
the
main
body
of
those
accretions
were
formed
in
here,
right
there
because
the
river
by
now
is
over
this
location
has
washed
back
this
way.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
they
think
the
old
shore
lines
are
along
here.
this
is
where
mississippi
held,
it
should
be
where
water
ceased
to
flow
at
the
first
low
water
and
this
--
this
is
the
point
where
louisiana
says
it
just
ceased
to
flow.
the
water
was
no
longer
a
running
stream
there.
these
are
the
accretions
here,
sir,
that
are
in
dispute
and
they
belong
to
this
area
between
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
about
4000
acres.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it's
being
used
for
grazing
timber
and
had
been
in
numerous
(inaudible)
leases
on
it.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that's
probably
is
the
milk
and
the
coconut.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
river,
sir,
it's
around
here,
over
here
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
--
and
through
here.
this
is
--
this
is
old
diamond
point
here.
in
1933,
they
made
a
shoot
cut-off
or
rather
a
cut-off
(inaudible)
mississippi
river
in.
the
commission,
they
cut
it
through
here
and
you
can
see
that
it's
just
beginning.
it's
just
beginning
to
take
all
of
the
--
the
flow
of
the
river.
that
brings
about
the
next
point
in
this
diamond
island
towhead
area.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
between
1964
and
1966.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
diamond
point,
sir,
diamond
point,
prior
to
the
avulsion.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
that
would
be
an
improper
statement,
sir,
because
the
river
meanders
back
and
forth.
at
one
time,
mississippi
owned
it,
another
time,
louisiana
owned
it.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
depending
on
the
processes
of
accretion
and
erosion.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
this
is
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
before
the
erosion,
the
line,
this
would
be
up
here
and
taken
into
the
island
(inaudible)
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
by
this
particular
chart.
it's
in
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it
means
so
far,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
would
think
so.
no,
sir,
because
the
--
this
particular
stretch
of
the
river
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
--
this
particular
portion
of
the
river
is
a
very
active
portion
insofar
as
those
processes
are
concerned.
originally
sir,
the
--
this
government
township
sections
were
down
in
here,
on
louisiana.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
that
part
where
it
built
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
--
this
land
was
here
at
the
time
of
the
avulsion,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
changed
the
course
of
the
river,
yes,
sir,
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
because
this
particular
point
meanders
out
and
cuts
off
all
except
that
little
tip
of
the
top
there
and
goes
over
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
you
mean
in
here,
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no,
sir.
that
was
a
dead
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
oh,
north
and
west
of
that,
yes,
sir.
there
is
no
dispute
here
that
the
channel
insofar
as
this
is
concerned
because
it's
beneath
north
like
that,
no
dispute
that
that
channel
is
in
that
old
water
up
to
about
here
as
you
can
see.
and
then,
the
dispute
starts
that
mississippi
says
that
even
though
this
bar
built
down
that
way
that
nevertheless
that
bar
built
after
the
phrase,
low
water
flowed
through
there.
and
even
though
it
was
built,
this
bar
here
was
built
by
accretion
to
louisiana
shore
but
nevertheless,
it
was
built
after
the
first
low
water
ceased
to
flow
that
therefore
that's
mississippi
there.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
they
--
they
say
that
it's
accrued.
i
would
say
--
it
has
to
say
following
that
accrue
--
accrued
to
the
line
and
not
the
land
because
they
have
to
admit
that
all
of
this
side
of
that
line
is
louisiana.
that
of
course
violates
the
principle
that
this
court
has
so
strongly
adhered
to,
that
if
the
channel
--
if
the
boundary
or
thalweg
is
in
a
river
and
that
river
changes
by
erosion
and
accretion
that
the
boundary
changes
with
the
river.
and
how
can
you
freeze
a
boundary
up
here
on
dry
land
if
you
are
going
to
continue
to
so
hold
that?
and
of
course,
this
court
has
held
at
so
many
times
and
it's
so
logical
in
its
early
review,
it
followed
all
of
the
european
countries
on
that
because
it's
the
great
right
to
the
water
in
front
it.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
this
present
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
this
present
dispute
goes
over
the
years
of
the
record.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
believe
way
beyond
1900
when
the
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
because
in
those
days,
they
were
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
no
one
did
know,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
there
were
two
change
of
title,
one
from
louisiana
and
one
from
mississippi.
they
were
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
both
in
louisiana
and
in
mississippi.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
oh
well,
i
shouldn't
say
lay
dormant
because
it
has
been
litigated
over
the
years
and
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
the
last
litigation
commenced
in
1937
in
mississippi
courts.
prior
to
that,
there
was
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it
commenced
on
the
basis
that
the
--
or
claiming
from
louisiana
a
title
to
this
last
litigation.
he
did
live
in
mississippi.
so,
the
mississippi
owners
of
this
--
had
the
mississippi
titles,
they
sued
the
louisiana
owners
who
were
residents
of
mississippi
in
the
mississippi
court
on
an
injunction
on
the
theory
that
we're
going
to
enjoin
from
litigating
over
in
louisiana,
because
the
louisiana
owners
had
sued
the
mississippi
people
in
attempts
of
land
over
and
--
timber
over
in
louisiana
and
it
was
just
a
great
number
of
lawsuits.
the
louisiana
owners
were
attempting
to
recover
in
trespass
for
cutting
timber
on
this
area
here
and
the
mississippi
owners
caught
the
--
louisiana
owners
in
mississippi
and
got
an
injunction
suit
on
them.
we
have
mentioned
some
of
those
here
in
our
briefs.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
that
we
and
it
was
up
to
that
supreme
court
about
four
times
between
1937
and
the
early
years
after
the
war.
that
court
finally
adjudicated
that
they
only
spoke
of
the
island
in
it
--
in
the
decision,
but
the
litigation
was
between
the
people
who
were
on
out
in
the
south
of
the
island
and
the
mississippi
people
here,
whether
the
accretion
to
certain
sections,
you
can
see
some
of
the
lines
here.
and
of
course,
the
decision
was
factual,
going
on
--
on
theory
that
this
line
and
--
at
some
other
reasoning
time
would
not
be
when
the
water
last
ceased
to
flow
in
that
channel.
the
expert
who
testified
for
mississippi
in
that
particular
case
had
testified
that
in
his
opinion,
he
thought
the
boundary
should
be
where
the
water,
just
before
50%
flowed
on
one
of
the
other
channels
and
we
speak
of
it
in
our
brief
as
the
50%
theory.
the
--
that
particular
statement
was
not
--
his
evidence
was
not
covered
in
the
report
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
but
it
affirmed
the
--
the
decision
of
the
chancellor
in
mississippi
and
the
chancellor's
report
based
it
on
that
theory
of
this
particular
man.
they
first
started
this
lawsuit
on
that
theory.
we
say
on
it,
what
we
call
--
they
thought
that
the
boundary
should
be
when
50%
of
the
water
started
crossing
--
more
than
50%
of
the
water
started
crossing
down
the
new
channel.
it's
been
our
opinion
and
position
all
along
that
the
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
was
conclusive
and
that
is
that
it
is
only
when
the
water
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream,
and
that
it
is
still
a
running
stream
even
though
at
some
stages
it
may
not
be
low
water
going
through
that
channel.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
before
1900,
sir
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
more
or
less,
we
have
in
the
record.
i
believe
i
pointed
out
in
the
early
brief
of
louisiana
that
there
needn't
be
afraid
of
the
record
because
so
much
it
involved
such
as
that.
they
have
volumes
of
deeds
and
tax
assessment
rules
showing
that
both
states
were
taxing
the
same
land.
and
both
states
were
claiming
titles
and
the
man
who
had
a
good
title
had
titles
in
both
states.
i
owe
that
particular
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
there
weren't
too
many
taxes
because
most
of
them
paid
the
taxes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
because
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
actually,
from
the
same
man
took
the
change
of
title,
yes,
sir.
the
evidence
will
show
that.
i
have
a
--
that
particular
phase
is
out
in
the
case
because
the
special
master
has
held
that
it
was
too
much
of
that
and
so
therefore
no
one
has
exclusively
possessed
and
the
state
of
mississippi
is
not
accepted
to
that
recommendation.
so,
the
next
problem,
if
there
are
no
other
questions
with
reference
to
this
particular
old
channel
here
when
water
last
ceased
to
flow
involved
actually
the
same
legal
point
and
that
is
where
shall
the
channel
be
fixed
on
the
southerly
side
of
those
accretions?
remember
that
the
channel
was
north
of
diamond
point,
nesting
the
diamond
point
was
here.
that
same
channel
used
to
be
up
here
and
flowing
around
here.
and
then
after
the
avulsion,
it
flowed
around
here
and
has
had
meanders
there
and
to
here.
and
our
point
is,
that
so
long
as
this
channel
has
a
running
stream
in
it,
and
is
subject
to
causing
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
and
subject
to
cause
this
land
or
this
channel
to
meander
while
the
boundary
remains
an
active
boundary
there.
the
special
master
held
that
when
the
water
first
ceased
to
flow
in
this
channel
here,
at
low
water
that
the
boundary
has
been
became
fixed,
despite
the
fact
that
this
channel
may
have
meandered
on
down
considerably,
the
master
spoke
of
a
third
of
a
mile.
i
believe
it's
a
third
to
half
a
mile
on
some
of
the
evidence
that
has
meandered
on
down
here.
in
other
words,
we
can
see
that
from
the
master's
line
here
that
he
stopped
in
the
thalweg
of
this
old
lane
mississippi,
goes
over
and
then
come
down
this
old
channel
which
he
says
was
abandoned
when
the
first
low
water
flowed
through
there
and
then
goes
up.
he
does
not
take
it
through
and
still
in
the
old
channel
which
we
say
continues
to
flow
and
we
believe
is
forcefully
demonstrated
by
two
things
here.
first,
the
position
of
the
mississippi
express
clause
or
on
the
testimony
that
the
water
ceased
to
flow
in
here
for
the
first
time
in
1939,
the
master
states
that
it
ceased
to
flow
in
there.
i'm
trying
to
quote
exactly
his
words
at
least
by
1940.
i
take
it
that
means
the
same
thing.
we
produced
a
photograph
which
showed
that
channel
here
in
1939.
we
had
the
witnesses
mark
it.
i
hope
your
honors
can
see
it.
this
is
the
old
channel
here,
has
the
cut
off
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
the
artificial
cut-off
right
here
made
in
1933.
it
does
not
show
all
of
this
upper
portion
here,
but
this
channel
here,
right
here
is
this
channel
here.
we
submitted
at
that
time
that
that
was
quite
some
channel
and
quite
some
river
to
have
ceased
to
flow
in
the
language
of
this
court
and
become
stagnant.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
it
was
taken
as
my
recollection
as
not
flood
water.
it
was
so
testified,
sir.
we
further
offered
in
evidence
the
water
stages
taken
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
for
the
year
1953
and
had
identified
by
one
of
their
engineers
who
was
an
employee
of
mississippi
river
commission
who
testified
for
them
in
a
private
capacity
that
he
took
the
water
stage
to
the
--
when
water
was
ceased
to
flow
in
here
at
a
stage
of
the
river
at
16.2
feet.
when
water
was
in
this
river
here,
16.2
feet,
it
did
not
flow
in
this
channel
across
here.
but
when
water
rose
above
16.2
feet,
it
did
flow
in
here.
in
accordance
with
this
information
here
form
mississippi
river
commission
as
to
the
depths
of
the
water
there,
we
find
that
this
old
channel
here,
even
in
1953
and
at
the
time
we
tried
this
case
is
with
the
latest
information.
flowed
commencing
on
february,
the
18th
and
19th
continued
for
the
rest
of
february,
all
of
march,
all
of
the
april
all
of
may
and
through
june
the
17th.
the
highest
that
the
water
got
at
any
time
of
any
portions
of
the
river
was
33.52
feet.
so,
it
is
obvious
that
the
difference
between
16th
in
the
fraction
of
feet
is
30
feet,
it
had
that
flow
in
there.
now,
of
course,
it
was
testified
that
1953
was
a
relatively
low
water
flow,
because
as
this
information
is
here
to
the
effect
that
flood
water
is
at
43
feet.
in
other
words,
it
was
still
flowing
through
here
through
this
old
channel
for
--
about
four
months
of
the
year
1953,
and
it
was
considerably
less
than
the
43-foot
flood
stage
as
high
as
three
fifths
and
33
in
a
fraction
feet.
we
also
had
much
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
since
the
master's
had
fixed
the
channel
here,
having
ceased
to
flow
that
it
had
meandered
some
1400
feet,
continued
on
meandering.
therefore,
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
were
in
full
effect.
that,
we
submit
will
take
care
of
the
boundary
around
the
island
and
will
divide
up
the
accretion
because
all
of
this
was
in
louisiana,
but
the
dispute
is
between
these
two
lines
and
there's
no
dispute
on
this
side
of
the
channel
of
the
island.
in
summary,
i
would
just
want
to
say
on
this
particular
part
of
the
case,
that
the
evidence
which
cannot
be
again
said
that
there
was
a
flow
in
that
channel,
as
this
particular
chart
of
the
mississippi
river
commission.
it
was
a
survey.
the
--
there
was
no
evidence
that
disputed
this.
the
theory
that
the
master
got
away
from
that
was
that
no
low
water
was
flowing
through
that
channel
at
the
time
of
this
survey,
but
it
would
be
a
considerable
flow
of
much
water
through
there
subject
to
navigation
at
the
time
this
chart
was
made
since
this
was
only
at
one-third
of
isolation
above
low
water.
and
therefore,
it
was
obviously
and
according
to
the
--
the
data
that
went
with
this
chart,
obviously
that
there
was
a
running
stream
there
and
it's
obvious
that
that
is
what
caused
this
stream
to
move
over
from
this
particular
line
where
the
water
ceased
to
flow
and
place
of
low
water.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
record
is
without
any
question,
sir,
the
diamond
point
had
gone
on
and
that
all
of
these
accretions
were
to
the
right
bank.
that's
--
that's
louisiana,
the
right
rescinding
bank.
this
was
never
disputed
that
this
was
louisiana
here.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
sir?
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
it
all.
i'll
answer
it
the
way
i
believe
i
understand
it,
sir.
the
master
held
and
there
was
no
dispute
that
these
accretions
were
to
the
right
bank
here.
this
was
nothing
but
an
elongation
or
a
projection
of
this
particular
bar
which
has
broken
up
throughout
the
record
as
been
involved.
there
has
never
been
any
dispute
so
far
as
i
know
that
the
accretions
were
there.
the
difference
came
about
that
mississippi
wanted
to
put
the
last
channel
which
would
stop
those
accretions
there
and
when
the
water
first
ceased
to
flow
at
low
water.
they
want
to
freeze
them
there
despite
the
fact
that
all
of
these
accretions
continued
to
form
to
the
right
bank,
continue
to
form
which
we
contend
as
louisiana
is
set
--
louisiana
up
to
the
redline.
and
there
is
no
reason
for
it
not
to
be
louisiana
pass
the
red
line
unless
the
master
be
correct,
that
is
that
the
accretion
--
that
the
channel
has
ceased
to
flow
when
it
had
no
low
water
flow.
was
that
the
question,
sir?
there
are
a
several
points
here
that
i
--i
don't
believe
deserve
too
much
comment
on
is
the
question
as
to
how
these
accretions
were
to
be
divided
in
--
to
the
owners
of
the
land
fronting
on
the
river
on
that
side
by
meaning
--
speaking
of
owners
i
mean,
the
mississippi
or
louisiana.
the
state
of
mississippi
contended
and
that
they
held
that
they
should
be
divided
by
running
a
line
at
right
angles
to
the
successive
thalwegs
of
the
stream
as
it
moved
away.
louisiana
thought
there
was
no
need
to
contest
that
because
it
is
--
except
louisiana.
there
are
other
theories
in
law
none
by
this
court
that
i
know
of
as
to
how
accretions
are
to
be
divided,
but
since
they
have
accepted
that,
we
will
accept
it.
we
believe
it's
all
right.
now,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
that
part,
i
will
turn
to
the
next
part.
the
next
part
of
the
case
has
been
referred
to
during
a
trial
of
the
case
and
in
various
brief
as
the
diamond
point
area,
and
that
is
filed,
this
diamond
point
in
1913,
as
the
year
we've
just
been
talking
about
up
here.
here's
the
little
island.
you
can
see
it's
up
in
here.
i
am
here.
this
is
the
bottom
end
of
it.
here's
the
little
island
we're
talking
about.
these
are
the
accretions
that
we've
been
talking
about.
now,
the
part
we're
going
to
talk
about
now
is
the
diamond
point,
here.
mississippi
contended
that
we've
already
stated
that
it
built
out
from
louisiana
and
--
from
mississippi
and
where
the
point
falls.
louisiana
admitted
that.
it's
in
the
record
as
a
stipulation.
and
we
admitted
the
diamond
point
was
a
part
of
mississippi.
in
the
stipulation,
however,
we
did
not
admit
what
the
boundaries
of
diamond
point
were.
it
is
obvious
that
we
were
a
complete
(inaudible)
heads
as
to
whether
where
the
boundary
on
the
north
was
because
the
same
legal
proposition
is
applicable
to
the
north
boundary
of
diamond
point
as
it
is
to
the
south
boundary
of
this
diamond
island
towhead
area.
so,
we
did
admit
that
and
we
didn't
admit
any
boundaries
and
because
with
stipulations
that
are
in
the
record.
now,
this
particular
point
has
to
do
with
an
island
that
was
formed
here,
sometime
approximately
in
1925
or
1926.
as
you
can
see
from
this
1913
chart,
the
channel
if
you
examine
closely
and
one
of
the
witnesses
do
this
on
it
which
we
reproduced
was,
“put
the
thalweg
over
here
against
the
north
bank
of
(inaudible)
bin,”
that
they
speak
of
here,
in
the
vicinity
of
where
the
island
first
formed.
the
--
the
question
of
course
is
on
which
side
of
the
thalweg
did
the
island
first
appear?
now,
that
would
determine
whether
it
would
belong
to
louisiana
or
to
mississippi.
if
it
formed
at
this
particular
time
in
1913
is
positioned
here,
it
will
be
obviously
louisiana.
i
must
explain
and
needed
it
to
the
court
that
this
portion
of
the
river
had
jumped
around
considerably,
as
mississippi
as
louisiana.
there
is
no
understanding
that
mississippi
will
all
be
adjacent
to
mississippi
because
you
may
find
some
portion
of
louisiana
separated
all
the
same
way
from
louisiana
and
the
reason
for
that
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
by
land,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes.
it
would
be
separate
areas
of
the
land,
for
example,
the
southern
point
area
is
separated
in
that
manner.
now,
it
is
louisiana
adjoining
mississippi.
that
of
course
is
brought
about
by
excessive
avulsion
and
--
now
the
part
that
we
want
to
find
out
about
is
where
was
this
thalweg
and
this
island
formed
in
this
channel.
there
is
not
a
sufficient
--
have
information
to
conclusively
show
where
that
is.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
my
argument
on
this
particular
point
is
thoroughly
covered
within
my
brief
and
i
would
prefer
to
save
my
rebuttal
for
the
diamond
point
towhead
area
if
the
court
will
apply.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
clearly,
yes,
sir.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
it's
based
on
obvious
fact
and
conclusions
from
those
found
facts
which
are
all
in
our
opinion,
mississippi
river
commission
charts.
it
would
have
to
be
a
legal
theory
that
would
determine
where
that
island
was
because
there
are
not
sufficient
charts
or
surveys
to
determine
actually
where
the
thalweg
was
when
the
island
was
formed.
briefly,
that
is
the
argument
we
make.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
the
fact,
the
legal
point
that
we
take
or
the
--
the
fact
that
we
take
that
a
thalweg
stays
on
the
outside
of
the
bank
and
if
it
is
there,
well,
that
is
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
and
that's
where
the
boundary
is.
now,
if
an
island
is
formed
or
if
that
ceases
to
be
the
deepest
channel
because
the
next
time
is
up.
the
next
map
we
have
which
was
the
first
map
that
showed
an
island,
shows
it
here.
we
still
have
a
channel
north
there.
we
still
have
a
channel
south
of
there.
now,
the
channel
through
the
south
of
the
area
is
slightly
deeper,
so
that's
where
the
thalweg
would
be
there
at
the
time
of
1925-1926,
but
we
say
that
the
history
actually
is
not
there
because
the
history
shows
that
that
north
channel
is
a
closing
channel.
and
therefore,
a
closing
channel
shows
that
it
was
the
main
channel.
now,
this
is
the
point
where
we
differ
basically
with
the
master.
as
you
can
see,
the
channel
here
was
the
1913
channel
here.
it
kept
eroding
back
in
here,
as
the
1920
channel,
as
the
1924
channel
right
here.
it
kept
eroding
back
over
here
and
because
of
developments
upriver
from
this
particular
point
suddenly
in
1925
or
1926.
this
channel
ceased
to
be
an
eroding
channel
and
became
--
and
in
creating
a
channel
because
in
1926
back
line
suddenly
comes
back
over
here,
the
1926
bank
line,
the
green
one.
so,
suddenly,
it
has
changed
all
of
its
activities
from
an
eroding
channel
back
and
it
jumped
back
over
here.
and
during
that
interval
of
time,
the
island
formed.
we
say
it
is
logical
that
the
channel
or
the
leading
channel
here,
that's
where
the
thalweg
was
and
that
mississippi
carried
the
burden
of
proof
and
there's
no
evidence
here
against
that
particular
theory.
we
like
to
reserve
the
remainder.
thank
you.
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
on
what
i
think
is
the
only
issue
in
the
court,
before
this
court
and
it
is
still
a
legal
form
that
is
on
the
diamond
point
here,
the
diamond
island
towhead
here.
that
point
is
as
this
court
has
held
that
in
a
case
of
an
avulsion,
so
long
as
the
old
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
capable
of
erosion
and
accretion
that
a
boundary
remains
in
that
stream
and
that's
the
only
point
involved
here
and
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
now,
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee,
here
is
the
decree.
i
have
quoted
heretofore
from
the
reasons.
the
decree
in
that
case
is
that
they
have
pointed
a
commission
through
--
get
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
erosions
and
accretions
that
occurred
in
the
old
channel
prior
to
its
abandonment
by
the
current
as
a
result
of
the
avulsion
in
1876.
and
the
question
whether
it
is
practical
now
to
locate
accurately
the
line
of
the
river
as
it
been
running.
in
other
words,
they
appointed
a
commission
to
find
out
what
happened
to
the
old
channel
by
locating
the
erosions
and
the
accretions.
they
spoke
nothing
of
any
low
water
channel.
a
running
stream
is
a
running
stream
whether
it
has
low
water
running
stream
or
not,
so
long
as
it
continuously
running,
has
a
bed
on
the
sides
and
banks
and
it
conveys
water
in
a
channel
that
are
--
is
usually
in
customary
for
example.
therefore,
the
only
question
on
this
point
that
we
--
hear
the
argument
of
that
is.
when
does
a
stream
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream?
we
say
that
this
court
has
said
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee,
it's
when
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
have
ceased
and
the
water
is
stagnant.
that
it
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream.
those
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
take
place
in
a
running
stream
that
do
not
take
place
otherwise.
so
if
the
court
is
going
to
followup
this
decision
here
which
is
based
on
logic
that
is
if
whenever
a
boundary
is
in
a
stream,
that
boundary
moves
with
the
stream,
we
would
like
to
submit
it
on
that.
we
think
the
briefs
amply
cover
--
mr.
ashton
l.
stewart
well,
i
--
i
can
spend
considerable
time
to
answer
that.
that
of
course
is
not
my
position,
none
whatsoever,
sir.
my
position
is
exactly
that
--
what
a
thalweg
is,
it's
the
main
navigation
of
a
stream
--
main
navigational
point.
and
the
court
has
repeatedly
concluded
it
as
a
valley
way.
as
i
say,
that
is
a
side
issue
here.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
before
this
court.
that's
a
play
on
words.
we
say
that
the
only
issue
here
is
when
is
a
running
stream
ceased
to
be
a
running
stream?
and
we
say
that
this
court
has
already
decided
that
point
and
i
say
that
that
is
in
logic.
that
is
following
the
general
theory
that
whenever
a
boundary
is
in
a
running
stream,
that
boundary
changes
with
the
change
of
the
stream
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretions
and
we
don't
believe
we
have
any
question
involved
on
--
that's
even
debatable
actually
if
the
court
will
just
examine
that
case
and
this
chart.
there
was
much
said
just
now
about
whether
--
there
be
no
evidence
to
support
our
statement
that
this
chart
shows
that
this
is
a
running
stream.
we
haven't
showed
that
this
channel
here
at
its
narrowest
point
was
300
feet
wide,
300
feet
wide
and
that's
not
a
channel.
that's
a
survey
channel.
counsel
referred
to
as
a
flow
--
overflow
water.
the
chart
shows
that
it
is
one-third
of
oscillation,
a
stream
(inaudible)
above
low
water
and
that's
about
14
feet,
the
height
of
that
channel
thus
far.
that's
some
30
feet
away
from
high
flood
water.
we
submit
the
case
and
let's
hear
some
answers
to
the
question.
thank
you.
ch
would
stop
those
accretions
there
and
when
the
water
first
ceased
to
flow
at
low
water.
they
want
to
freeze
them
there
despite
the
fact
that
all
of
these
accretions
continued
to
form
to
the
right
bank,
continue
to
form
which
we
contend
as
louisiana
is
set
--
louisiana
up
to
the
redline.
and
there
is
no
reason
for
it
not
to
be
louisiana
pass
the
red
line
unless
the
master
be
correct,
that
is
that
the
accretion
--
that
the
channel
has
ceased
to
flow
when
it
had
no
low
water
flow.
was
that
the
question,
sir?
there
are
a
several
points
here
that
i
--i
don't
believe
deserve
too
much
comment
on
is
the
question
as
to
how
these
accretions
were
to
be
divided
in
--
to
the
owners
of
the
land
fronting
on
the
river
on
that
side
by
meaning
--
speaking
of
owners
i
mean,
the
mississippi
or
louisiana.
the
state
of
mississippi
contended
and
that
they
held
that
they
should
be
divided
by
running
a
line
at
right
angles
to
the
successive
thalwegs
of
the
stream
as
it
moved
away.
louisiana
thought
there
was
no
need
to
contest
that
because
it
is
--
except
louisiana.
there
are
other
theories
in
law
none
by
this
court
that
i
know
of
as
to
how
accretions
are
to
be
divided,
but
since
they
have
accepted
that,
we
will
accept
it.
we
believe
it's
all
right.
now,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
that
part,
i
will
turn
to
the
next
part.
the
next
part
of
the
case
has
been
referred
to
during
a
trial
of
the
case
and
in
various
brief
as
the
diamond
point
area,
and
that
is
filed,
this
diamond
point
in
1913,
as
the
year
we've
just
been
talking
about
up
here.
here's
the
little
island.
you
can
see
it's
up
in
here.
i
am
here.
this
is
the
bottom
end
of
it.
here's
the
little
island
we're
talking
about.
these
are
the
accretions
that
we've
been
talking
about.
now,
the
part
we're
going
to
talk
about
now
is
the
diamond
point,
here.
mississippi
contended
that
we've
already
stated
that
it
built
out
from
louisiana
and
--
from
mississippi
and
where
the
point
falls.
louisiana
admitted
that.
it's
in
the
record
as
a
stipulation.
and
we
admitted
the
diamond
point
was
a
part
of
mississippi.
in
the
stipulation,
however,
we
did
not
admit
what
the
boundaries
of
diamond
point
were.
it
is
obvious
that
we
were

to
the

boundary
of
diamond
point
as
it
is
to
the
south
boundary
of
this
diamond
island
towhead
area.
so,
we
did
admit
that
and
we
didn't
admit
any
boundaries
and
because
with
stipulations
that
are
in
the
record.
now,
this
particular
point
has
to
do
with
an
island
that
was
formed
here,
sometime
approximately
in
1925
or
1926.
as
you
can

from
this
1913

the
channel
if

examine
closely
and
one

which

was,
