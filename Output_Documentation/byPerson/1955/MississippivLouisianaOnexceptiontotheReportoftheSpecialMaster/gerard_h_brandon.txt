mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
we
should
immediately
make
known
the
facts
that
mississippi
finds
itself
in
complete
disagreement
with
louisiana,
when
they
say
that
there's
no
dispute
of
facts
here
and
in
complete
disagreement
as
to
what
are
the
well
established
facts.
likewise,
we
found
ourselves
in
disagreement
with
louisiana
as
to
the
applicable
law
of
the
case,
as
the
conflicting
briefs
of
each
part
into
the
suit
will
clearly
demonstrate.
when
this
suit
was
instituted,
that
was
brought
by
the
state
of
mississippi
to
establish
its
right
and
sovereignty
in
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states
affecting
an
area
of
something
over
20,000
acres
of
land
that
were
being
in
whole
or
in
part
adversely
claimed
by
louisiana
and
which
in
louisiana's
answer,
their
certain
title
adverse
to
the
title
claim
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
subsequently,
after
the
investigation
of
the
case
and
proceeded
by
louisiana,
louisiana
did
enter
into
two
stipulations
that
appear
in
the
record
and
in
the
master's
report.
one
to
the
effect
that
prior
to
1864
or
1865,
a
point
bar
had
built
out
from
mississippi
as
alleged
in
mississippi's
complaint.
and
that
an
avulsion
occurred
across
this
point
of
land
separating
a
part
of
mississippi
from
the
rest
of
the
mainland
and
they
admitted
that
the
part
so
separated
was
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
but
proceeded
then
to
claim
all
of
the
land
around
that
separated
part
and
to
make
this
part
of
mississippi
a
complete
island
surrounded
not
by
water
but
by
louisiana.
a
situation
which
is
contrary
to
natural
effects
of
the
operation
of
role
of
the
mississippi
river,
its
changes
of
course
and
also
would
be
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
contend
that
the
--
louisiana
contends
that
there
could
be
an
island
of
mississippi
completely
surrounded
by
land.
we
have
authority
to
which
we
recite
--
recite
to
the
court
that
the
subsequent
filling
of
this
channel
and
the
resulting
processes
following
the
avulsion
will
not
--
are
not
governed
by
the
law
of
erosion
and
accretion.
the
filling
of
the
channel
will
not
press
back
the
boundary
of
a
state
and
that
one
state
whereas
the
course
of
a
boundary
can
change
by
erosion
and
accretion,
but
by
the
filling
of
the
channel
that
it
could
not
press
back
the
boundary.
and
in
other
words,
it
was
accretion
formed
to
both
mississippi
and
louisiana.
may
i
post
for
a
moment,
your
honor?
to
demonstrate
what
i
mean
by
that,
it
must
be
born
in
mind
that
this
chart
shows
a
situation
after
there
had
been
an
avulsion,
but
of
course
it
must
be
born
in
mind
with
the
state
boundary
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
at
that
time
followed
that
thalweg
of
course
around
the
river
and
that
this
entire
channel
in
here
and
supposed
shoot
cut-off
channel
toward
mississippi.
it
was
mississippi
on
both
sides.
it
was
mississippi
all
the
way
from
--
from
this
point
here
down
to
this
point
below
and
that
whatever
filling
in
here
was
the
effect
of
the
avulsion
and
not
the
effect
of
erosion
and
accretion.
and
the
location
of
those
boundaries
and
that
thalweg
was
clearly
established
by
geologists,
by
experienced
engineers
and
born
in
mind
--
and
born
out,
corroborated
by
the
actual
owned
seen
report
of
major
charles
r.
suter
who
made
this
reconnaissance
survey
in
the
year
1874,
some
several
years
after
the
occurrence
of
the
avulsion.
and
at
the
conclusion
or
completion
of
the
process
of
the
avulsion,
the
shoot
cut-off
channel
had
been
initiated
as
never
as
we
can
historically
ascertain.
the
claim
the
years
1864
and
1866,
but
major
suter
reported
from
his
own
name,
seen
the
report
to
the
corps
of
engineers
on
his
reconnaissance.
he
made
his
report
in
1875
in
february,
that
it
resulted
a
flood
of
1874,
he
bend
of
diamond
island
had
filled
and
the
mississippi
river
had
established
itself
permanently
in
the
shoot.
and
that
was
a
complete
filling
of
that
whole
river
bed
without
(inaudible)
around
here
and
i'd
jump
to
show
on
another
map
as
being
yet
one
with
a
running
stream.
the
first
controlled
surveys
of
the
mississippi
river
commission
was
one
made
from
a
reconnaissance
surveys
and
actual
controlled
surveys
of
1878
and
1880
period.
and
the
map
of
1880,
exhibit
10
to
the
bill
of
complaint
for
the
state
of
mississippi
in
this
case
about
which
much
testimony
was
taken,
shows
conclusively
that
the
old
channel
that
had
existed
around
to
the
north
and
west
of
what
is
now
known
as
diamond
island
towhead
had
completely
filled.
so
far
filled
that
at
minimal
water,
you
could
not
have
--
you
could
--
there
could
be
no
entry
of
water
there
even
at
a
stage
of
20
feet
above
minimum
water
and
it
was
perfectly
dry
completely
across
the
old
riverbed
at
the
time
of
that
matter.
now,
counsel
for
louisiana
in
their
brief
and
in
their
exposition
of
the
problem
here
before
this
court
have
selected
one
chart,
which
they
have
denoted
and
reproduced
in
their
brief
as
their
plate
one
being
the
chart,
which
counsel
says
shows
a
stream
of
water.
that
chart
was
one
made
from
a
number
of
manuscript
charts
of
no
definite
period,
and
that
no
definite
stage
of
the
water.
the
stage
in
that
particular
area
for
whatever
particular
time
it
was,
sometime
after
1880
showed
a
stage
of
some
20
or
more
feet
above
minimal
water.
much
evidence
was
taken
concerning
this
chart
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
pertinent
whatsoever
to
the
establishment
of
the
boundary
line,
or
as
has
been
demonstrated
by
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
and
indeed
seen
by
the
master
who
went
on
this
particular
area
and
made
a
first
known
inspection
thereof.
what
is
shown
here
is
nothing
more
than
one
of
a
number
of
flood
scoured
out,
drained
channels
that
made
from
time
to
time
be
located
first
here
then
there,
depending
upon
the
overflow
water
of
the
mississippi
river
during
times
of
flood
or
high
water.
and
the
geologist,
dr.
h.
n.
fisk
who
was
the
chief
geological
consultant
for
the
mississippi
river
commission
for
many
years
and
still
occupies
the
position,
in
an
advisory
capacity
and
the
control
of
the
flows
of
the
mississippi
river
from
pittsburgh
to
the
gulf,
advising
the
engineers
and
the
president
of
the
mississippi
river
commission,
described
that
situation
and
said
that
it
did
not
locate
and
did
not
approximate
the
abandoned
thalweg
or
deep
water
channel
line
of
the
river
course
as
it
had
existed
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
of
the
avulsion.
that
is
was
nothing
more
than
a
surfaced
scour
feature
brought
about
by
the
washing
or
scouring
effects
of
high
water
overflow.
as
the
water
would
flow
and
for
that
manner
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
at
times
of
high
water
until
the
unofficial
cut-offs
have
been
constructed
had
now
spin
the
water
to
the
mississippi
river,
this
entire
flood
rain
overflowed
every
year
and
would
overflow
this
year
and
would
overflow
much
vast
of
areas,
pronounced
that
the
construction
of
that
isn't
along
the
bank
that
protects
the
alluvial
lands
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
how
was
that,
sir?
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir,
the
thalweg
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
he
gave
it
to
us.
he
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
you
could
not
possibly
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
do
the
best
you
can
on
available
charts,
on
a
testimony
of
witnesses
that
may
have
memory
of
it
on
the
--
and
on
this
basis,
on
--
on
scars
features
that
can
be
seen
on
--
on
aerial
mosaics,
sir,
that
an
expert
can
take
that
and
he
can
see
these
features
of
difference
of
--
of
coloring
that
make
shadows
and
he
can
tell
where
it
formed
and
where
it
was
and
what
the
difference
in
growth
is.
that
(inaudible),
it
would
be
interesting
to
note.
it
has
shown
from
such
aerial
mosaics
the
varying
courses
of
the
mississippi
river
in
the
lower
--
lower
area
or
as
my
friend
says,
“for
all
recent
times,
some
20,000
years
from
the
texas
border
to
the
mississippi
hills,”
as
it
has
meandered
in
that
area
and
that
sir
can
be
done.
his
study
of
this
area
was
of
course
of
real
recent
time
and
he
made
actual
borings
on
the
ground,
took
deposits
of
gravels
and
sands
and
clays
and
came
up
with
his
expert
opinion,
which
when
he
reproduced
on
the
exhibits
that
are
in
evidence
here,
the
former
thalweg
course
of
the
mississippi
river
without
himself
having
at
any
time
prior
thereto
have
been
familiar
with
the
report
of
major
suter
so
closely
corresponded
there
with
that
it
was
quite
remarkable
and
so
closely
does
that
we
can
say
truthfully
that
the
point
of
thalweg,
that
(inaudible)
shown
on
a
suter
map
and
those
shown
on
the
charts
of
dr.fisk
are
one
and
the
same
for
all
practical
purposes.
now
then,
another
way,
sir,
of
getting
at
that
is
for
an
engineer
familiar
with
the
widening
of
mississippi
river
such
as
mr.
austin
b.smith,
with
the
mississippi
river
commission
and
the
corps
of
engineers,
an
active
flood
control
work
for
25
years
who
was
in
charged
of
the
construction
of
some
of
these
artificial
cut-offs
has
seen
these
old
channels
become
abandoned
and
clogged
up
and
filled
and
can
tell
at
what
rate
they
do
so.
he
can
make
calculations
as
he
did
by
the
calculated
accretion
rates
and
erosion
rates
and
filling
rates
in
abandoned
channels
and
thereby
locate
to
a
close
proximity,
the
situation
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
flow
that
the
flow
ceased
in
the
old
channel
or
when
the
avulsion
was
completed.
the
special
master
in
this
case
had
the
benefit
of
that
expert
opinion
evidence,
but
he
also
had
the
benefit
of
lay
witnesses
who
justified.
now,
about
this
situation
here,
let's
turn
back
to
the
reproduction
of
the
suter
map.
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
and
the
chart
of
1880
shows
that
upon
the
occurrence
of
this
avulsion,
the
forces
of
the
water
flowing
and
divided
as
it
were
by
the
head
of
the
island
and
the
course
of
filling
this
abandoned
channel
caused
a
deposition
of
gravel
bar
as
a
part
of
this
island
between
the
divided
flow
of
the
water.
and
that
that
gravel
bar,
that
deposition
is
yet
there
as
justified
by
lay
witnesses
who
had
navigated
in
that
area,
who
--
one
who
lived
on
the
land
and
had
seen
where
accretions
had
formed
and
know
where
they
were,
a
steamboat
captain
and
by
the
geologist
for
louisiana
who
made
the
borings
as
well
as
dr.fisk,
so
that
the
master
was
supported
in
his
findings
of
fact
by
what
he
saw
because
he
do
saw
the
deposition
of
this
gravel
in
that
area
and
which
he
has
reported
therefore,
never
washed
away.
and
therefore,
that
the
channel
of
the
mississippi
river,
the
navigable
channels
have
never
been
in
such
a
contorted
location
as
counsel
for
louisiana
now
claim,
but
he
was
supported
by
those
lay
witnesses
in
addition
to
the
experts.
now,
as
we
take
it,
the
entire
fallacy
of
louisiana's
argument
in
this
case
has
been
that
whereas
at
the
present
moment,
they
may
be
required
to
confess
that
the
word
“thalweg”
has
an
important
bearing
upon
the
determination
of
the
boundaries
in
dispute
has
--
has
long
been
established
by
this
court
and
it
does
not
merely
mean
a
valley
way
that
it
is
related
to
navigation.
it
is
the
course
of
navigation
or
the
sailing
main
downstream
and
therefore
that
of
the
greatest
amount
of
current
as
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
held.
and
that
the
thalweg
doctrine
is
one
which
they
have
ignored
in
their
entire
presentation
of
this
case
and
they
seized
upon
the
use
--
an
informant
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
of
language
that
gave
them
hope
when
the
court
spoke
of
the
stream
becoming
stagnant
or
as
long
as
there's
water
is
flowing,
it
is
susceptible
of
change.
but
of
course
what
this
court
meant,
when
that
navigable
channel
is
filled
and
when
the
water
--
the
current
ceased
to
flow
therein,
then
the
boundary
is
fixed
in
that
old
channel
as
this
court
has
defined
it
to
wit
in
the
navigable
channel,
in
the
--
along
the
thalweg
of
the
navigable
channel
as
that
thalweg
as
such
last
existed.
and
so,
it
is
that
the
court,
the
master
below
has
so
found.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
in
louisiana's
contention?
may
it
please
the
court.
louisiana
has
of
course
produced
only
a
view
of
the
current
numerous
charts
and
then
on
first
year
until
that
i
saw
one
that
i
might
be
able
to
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
sir?
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir.
i
think
a
matter
of
--
at
the
closest
point,
possibly
some
five
miles.
i
might
--
from
mississippi
to
it?
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i
did
not
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
well,
we
don't
think
we
have
to
go
through
any
because
we
think
it
is
contiguous
throughout
to
mississippi.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
but
if
louisiana
prevailed
as
they
contend
and
if
all
of
the
accretion
south
of
it,
original
cut-off
area
were
alloted
to
louisiana.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
some
five
miles,
as
near
as
i
can
just
judge
it.
i
wouldn't
--
you
want
to
take
a
note
on
it,
sir.
and
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
according
to
their
contentions
on
one
theory.
now,
they
could
have
an
ultimate
theory
by
which
they
do
accord
louisiana
and
to
mississippi
the
right
of
accretion,
but
they
want
to
relocate
the
place
for
the
apportionment
of
that
accretion
as
mr.
stewart
has
shown
you
and
that
would
narrow
it
down
and
take
--
deprive
i
think
mr.
stewart
estimated
some
5000
acres
of
land
or
area
that
would
be
there
involved.
but
the
--
of
course,
the
decision
was
done
upon
fixing
the
boundary
as
it
last
existed.
and
then,
the
river
having
thereafter
again
changed
its
course
in
the
course
of
a
migration
to
project
that
boundary
at
all
times
at
right
angles
to
each
successive
ascertainable
thalweg
within
the
mississippi
river.
now,
the
reason
we
do
that
is
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
i
would
say
that
would
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
preserve
the
states
their
respect
to
territory
to
which
they
are
entitled
under
the
law,
sir.
because
it
must
be
born
in
mind
that
this
shoot
cut-off
channel
when
it
formed
through
its
entire
length
and
breadth
was
mississippi.
it
brought
across
mississippi
territory
and
the
new
bed
of
the
mississippi
river
was
completely
in
on
both
sides
and
throughout
its
length
and
breadth,
a
part
of
mississippi.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
i
know
of
none
that
do
not
touch
upon
the
mississippi
river
at
one
point
--
one
part
or
another.
i
know
of
tons
of
land
that
i
can
walk
from
mississippi
into
louisiana,
but
at
one
end
of
it
is
a
mississippi
river.
that's
a
--
a
point
such
as
that
that
has
been
cut-off
at
its
neck,
but
of
course
as
the
river
thereafter
moves
while
there's
accretion
to
that,
as
there
is
to
the
other
and
it
must
always
be
adjacent
therefore
to
the
river.
and
i
therefore
know
of
none
that
is
completely
separated
as
they
have
sought
in
this
case
to
accomplish.
now,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
desire
to
leave
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
mr.
james
who
will
discuss
some
other
features
of
the
case.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
we
should
immediately
make
known
the
facts
that
mississippi
finds
itself
in
complete
disagreement
with
louisiana,
when
they
say
that
there's
no
dispute
of
facts
here
and
in
complete
disagreement
as
to
what
are
the
well
established
facts.
likewise,
we
found
ourselves
in
disagreement
with
louisiana
as
to
the
applicable
law
of
the
case,
as
the
conflicting
briefs
of
each
part
into
the
suit
will
clearly
demonstrate.
when
this
suit
was
instituted,
that
was
brought
by
the
state
of
mississippi
to
establish
its
right
and
sovereignty
in
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states
affecting
an
area
of
something
over
20,000
acres
of
land
that
were
being
in
whole
or
in
part
adversely
claimed
by
louisiana
and
which
in
louisiana's
answer,
their
certain
title
adverse
to
the
title
claim
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
subsequently,
after
the
investigation
of
the
case
and
proceeded
by
louisiana,
louisiana
did
enter
into
two
stipulations
that
appear
in
the
record
and
in
the
master's
report.
one
to
the
effect
that
prior
to
1864
or
1865,
a
point
bar
had
built
out
from
mississippi
as
alleged
in
mississippi's
complaint.
and
that
an
avulsion
occurred
across
this
point
of
land
separating
a
part
of
mississippi
from
the
rest
of
the
mainland
and
they
admitted
that
the
part
so
separated
was
in
the
state
of
mississippi,
but
proceeded
then
to
claim
all
of
the
land
around
that
separated
part
and
to
make
this
part
of
mississippi
a
complete
island
surrounded
not
by
water
but
by
louisiana.
a
situation
which
is
contrary
to
natural
effects
of
the
operation
of
role
of
the
mississippi
river,
its
changes
of
course
and
also
would
be
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
contend
that
the
--
louisiana
contends
that
there
could
be
an
island
of
mississippi
completely
surrounded
by
land.
we
have
authority
to
which
we
recite
--
recite
to
the
court
that
the
subsequent
filling
of
this
channel
and
the
resulting
processes
following
the
avulsion
will
not
--
are
not
governed
by
the
law
of
erosion
and
accretion.
the
filling
of
the
channel
will
not
press
back
the
boundary
of
a
state
and
that
one
state
whereas
the
course
of
a
boundary
can
change
by
erosion
and
accretion,
but
by
the
filling
of
the
channel
that
it
could
not
press
back
the
boundary.
and
in
other
words,
it
was
accretion
formed
to
both
mississippi
and
louisiana.
may
i
post
for
a
moment,
your
honor?
to
demonstrate
what
i
mean
by
that,
it
must
be
born
in
mind
that
this
chart
shows
a
situation
after
there
had
been
an
avulsion,
but
of
course
it
must
be
born
in
mind
with
the
state
boundary
between
the
state
of
mississippi
and
louisiana
at
that
time
followed
that
thalweg
of
course
around
the
river
and
that
this
entire
channel
in
here
and
supposed
shoot
cut-off
channel
toward
mississippi.
it
was
mississippi
on
both
sides.
it
was
mississippi
all
the
way
from
--
from
this
point
here
down
to
this
point
below
and
that
whatever
filling
in
here
was
the
effect
of
the
avulsion
and
not
the
effect
of
erosion
and
accretion.
and
the
location
of
those
boundaries
and
that
thalweg
was
clearly
established
by
geologists,
by
experienced
engineers
and
born
in
mind
--
and
born
out,
corroborated
by
the
actual
owned
seen
report
of
major
charles
r.
suter
who
made
this
reconnaissance
survey
in
the
year
1874,
some
several
years
after
the
occurrence
of
the
avulsion.
and
at
the
conclusion
or
completion
of
the
process
of
the
avulsion,
the
shoot
cut-off
channel
had
been
initiated
as
never
as
we
can
historically
ascertain.
the
claim
the
years
1864
and
1866,
but
major
suter
reported
from
his
own
name,
seen
the
report
to
the
corps
of
engineers
on
his
reconnaissance.
he
made
his
report
in
1875
in
february,
that
it
resulted
a
flood
of
1874,
he
bend
of
diamond
island
had
filled
and
the
mississippi
river
had
established
itself
permanently
in
the
shoot.
and
that
was
a
complete
filling
of
that
whole
river
bed
without
(inaudible)
around
here
and
i'd
jump
to
show
on
another
map
as
being
yet
one
with
a
running
stream.
the
first
controlled
surveys
of
the
mississippi
river
commission
was
one
made
from
a
reconnaissance
surveys
and
actual
controlled
surveys
of
1878
and
1880
period.
and
the
map
of
1880,
exhibit
10
to
the
bill
of
complaint
for
the
state
of
mississippi
in
this
case
about
which
much
testimony
was
taken,
shows
conclusively
that
the
old
channel
that
had
existed
around
to
the
north
and
west
of
what
is
now
known
as
diamond
island
towhead
had
completely
filled.
so
far
filled
that
at
minimal
water,
you
could
not
have
--
you
could
--
there
could
be
no
entry
of
water
there
even
at
a
stage
of
20
feet
above
minimum
water
and
it
was
perfectly
dry
completely
across
the
old
riverbed
at
the
time
of
that
matter.
now,
counsel
for
louisiana
in
their
brief
and
in
their
exposition
of
the
problem
here
before
this
court
have
selected
one
chart,
which
they
have
denoted
and
reproduced
in
their
brief
as
their
plate
one
being
the
chart,
which
counsel
says
shows
a
stream
of
water.
that
chart
was
one
made
from
a
number
of
manuscript
charts
of
no
definite
period,
and
that
no
definite
stage
of
the
water.
the
stage
in
that
particular
area
for
whatever
particular
time
it
was,
sometime
after
1880
showed
a
stage
of
some
20
or
more
feet
above
minimal
water.
much
evidence
was
taken
concerning
this
chart
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
pertinent
whatsoever
to
the
establishment
of
the
boundary
line,
or
as
has
been
demonstrated
by
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
and
indeed
seen
by
the
master
who
went
on
this
particular
area
and
made
a
first
known
inspection
thereof.
what
is
shown
here
is
nothing
more
than
one
of
a
number
of
flood
scoured
out,
drained
channels
that
made
from
time
to
time
be
located
first
here
then
there,
depending
upon
the
overflow
water
of
the
mississippi
river
during
times
of
flood
or
high
water.
and
the
geologist,
dr.
h.
n.
fisk
who
was
the
chief
geological
consultant
for
the
mississippi
river
commission
for
many
years
and
still
occupies
the
position,
in
an
advisory
capacity
and
the
control
of
the
flows
of
the
mississippi
river
from
pittsburgh
to
the
gulf,
advising
the
engineers
and
the
president
of
the
mississippi
river
commission,
described
that
situation
and
said
that
it
did
not
locate
and
did
not
approximate
the
abandoned
thalweg
or
deep
water
channel
line
of
the
river
course
as
it
had
existed
at
the
time
of
the
occurrence
of
the
avulsion.
that
is
was
nothing
more
than
a
surfaced
scour
feature
brought
about
by
the
washing
or
scouring
effects
of
high
water
overflow.
as
the
water
would
flow
and
for
that
manner
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
at
times
of
high
water
until
the
unofficial
cut-offs
have
been
constructed
had
now
spin
the
water
to
the
mississippi
river,
this
entire
flood
rain
overflowed
every
year
and
would
overflow
this
year
and
would
overflow
much
vast
of
areas,
pronounced
that
the
construction
of
that
isn't
along
the
bank
that
protects
the
alluvial
lands
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
how
was
that,
sir?
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir,
the
thalweg
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
he
gave
it
to
us.
he
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
you
could
not
possibly
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
do
the
best
you
can
on
available
charts,
on
a
testimony
of
witnesses
that
may
have
memory
of
it
on
the
--
and
on
this
basis,
on
--
on
scars
features
that
can
be
seen
on
--
on
aerial
mosaics,
sir,
that
an
expert
can
take
that
and
he
can
see
these
features
of
difference
of
--
of
coloring
that
make
shadows
and
he
can
tell
where
it
formed
and
where
it
was
and
what
the
difference
in
growth
is.
that
(inaudible),
it
would
be
interesting
to
note.
it
has
shown
from
such
aerial
mosaics
the
varying
courses
of
the
mississippi
river
in
the
lower
--
lower
area
or
as
my
friend
says,
“for
all
recent
times,
some
20,000
years
from
the
texas
border
to
the
mississippi
hills,”
as
it
has
meandered
in
that
area
and
that
sir
can
be
done.
his
study
of
this
area
was
of
course
of
real
recent
time
and
he
made
actual
borings
on
the
ground,
took
deposits
of
gravels
and
sands
and
clays
and
came
up
with
his
expert
opinion,
which
when
he
reproduced
on
the
exhibits
that
are
in
evidence
here,
the
former
thalweg
course
of
the
mississippi
river
without
himself
having
at
any
time
prior
thereto
have
been
familiar
with
the
report
of
major
suter
so
closely
corresponded
there
with
that
it
was
quite
remarkable
and
so
closely
does
that
we
can
say
truthfully
that
the
point
of
thalweg,
that
(inaudible)
shown
on
a
suter
map
and
those
shown
on
the
charts
of
dr.fisk
are
one
and
the
same
for
all
practical
purposes.
now
then,
another
way,
sir,
of
getting
at
that
is
for
an
engineer
familiar
with
the
widening
of
mississippi
river
such
as
mr.
austin
b.smith,
with
the
mississippi
river
commission
and
the
corps
of
engineers,
an
active
flood
control
work
for
25
years
who
was
in
charged
of
the
construction
of
some
of
these
artificial
cut-offs
has
seen
these
old
channels
become
abandoned
and
clogged
up
and
filled
and
can
tell
at
what
rate
they
do
so.
he
can
make
calculations
as
he
did
by
the
calculated
accretion
rates
and
erosion
rates
and
filling
rates
in
abandoned
channels
and
thereby
locate
to
a
close
proximity,
the
situation
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
the
flow
that
the
flow
ceased
in
the
old
channel
or
when
the
avulsion
was
completed.
the
special
master
in
this
case
had
the
benefit
of
that
expert
opinion
evidence,
but
he
also
had
the
benefit
of
lay
witnesses
who
justified.
now,
about
this
situation
here,
let's
turn
back
to
the
reproduction
of
the
suter
map.
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
and
the
chart
of
1880
shows
that
upon
the
occurrence
of
this
avulsion,
the
forces
of
the
water
flowing
and
divided
as
it
were
by
the
head
of
the
island
and
the
course
of
filling
this
abandoned
channel
caused
a
deposition
of
gravel
bar
as
a
part
of
this
island
between
the
divided
flow
of
the
water.
and
that
that
gravel
bar,
that
deposition
is
yet
there
as
justified
by
lay
witnesses
who
had
navigated
in
that
area,
who
--
one
who
lived
on
the
land
and
had
seen
where
accretions
had
formed
and
know
where
they
were,
a
steamboat
captain
and
by
the
geologist
for
louisiana
who
made
the
borings
as
well
as
dr.fisk,
so
that
the
master
was
supported
in
his
findings
of
fact
by
what
he
saw
because
he
do
saw
the
deposition
of
this
gravel
in
that
area
and
which
he
has
reported
therefore,
never
washed
away.
and
therefore,
that
the
channel
of
the
mississippi
river,
the
navigable
channels
have
never
been
in
such
a
contorted
location
as
counsel
for
louisiana
now
claim,
but
he
was
supported
by
those
lay
witnesses
in
addition
to
the
experts.
now,
as
we
take
it,
the
entire
fallacy
of
louisiana's
argument
in
this
case
has
been
that
whereas
at
the
present
moment,
they
may
be
required
to
confess
that
the
word
“thalweg”
has
an
important
bearing
upon
the
determination
of
the
boundaries
in
dispute
has
--
has
long
been
established
by
this
court
and
it
does
not
merely
mean
a
valley
way
that
it
is
related
to
navigation.
it
is
the
course
of
navigation
or
the
sailing
main
downstream
and
therefore
that
of
the
greatest
amount
of
current
as
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
held.
and
that
the
thalweg
doctrine
is
one
which
they
have
ignored
in
their
entire
presentation
of
this
case
and
they
seized
upon
the
use
--
an
informant
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
of
language
that
gave
them
hope
when
the
court
spoke
of
the
stream
becoming
stagnant
or
as
long
as
there's
water
is
flowing,
it
is
susceptible
of
change.
but
of
course
what
this
court
meant,
when
that
navigable
channel
is
filled
and
when
the
water
--
the
current
ceased
to
flow
therein,
then
the
boundary
is
fixed
in
that
old
channel
as
this
court
has
defined
it
to
wit
in
the
navigable
channel,
in
the
--
along
the
thalweg
of
the
navigable
channel
as
that
thalweg
as
such
last
existed.
and
so,
it
is
that
the
court,
the
master
below
has
so
found.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
in
louisiana's
contention?
may
it
please
the
court.
louisiana
has
of
course
produced
only
a
view
of
the
current
numerous
charts
and
then
on
first
year
until
that
i
saw
one
that
i
might
be
able
to
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
sir?
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir.
i
think
a
matter
of
--
at
the
closest
point,
possibly
some
five
miles.
i
might
--
from
mississippi
to
it?
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i
did
not
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
well,
we
don't
think
we
have
to
go
through
any
because
we
think
it
is
contiguous
throughout
to
mississippi.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
but
if
louisiana
prevailed
as
they
contend
and
if
all
of
the
accretion
south
of
it,
original
cut-off
area
were
alloted
to
louisiana.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
some
five
miles,
as
near
as
i
can
just
judge
it.
i
wouldn't
--
you
want
to
take
a
note
on
it,
sir.
and
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
according
to
their
contentions
on
one
theory.
now,
they
could
have
an
ultimate
theory
by
which
they
do
accord
louisiana
and
to
mississippi
the
right
of
accretion,
but
they
want
to
relocate
the
place
for
the
apportionment
of
that
accretion
as
mr.
stewart
has
shown
you
and
that
would
narrow
it
down
and
take
--
deprive
i
think
mr.
stewart
estimated
some
5000
acres
of
land
or
area
that
would
be
there
involved.
but
the
--
of
course,
the
decision
was
done
upon
fixing
the
boundary
as
it
last
existed.
and
then,
the
river
having
thereafter
again
changed
its
course
in
the
course
of
a
migration
to
project
that
boundary
at
all
times
at
right
angles
to
each
successive
ascertainable
thalweg
within
the
mississippi
river.
now,
the
reason
we
do
that
is
--
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
i
would
say
that
would
have
to
be
done
in
order
to
preserve
the
states
their
respect
to
territory
to
which
they
are
entitled
under
the
law,
sir.
because
it
must
be
born
in
mind
that
this
shoot
cut-off
channel
when
it
formed
through
its
entire
length
and
breadth
was
mississippi.
it
brought
across
mississippi
territory
and
the
new
bed
of
the
mississippi
river
was
completely
in
on
both
sides
and
throughout
its
length
and
breadth,
a
part
of
mississippi.
mr.
gerard
h.
brandon
i
know
of
none
that
do
not
touch
upon
the
mississippi
river
at
one
point
--
one
part
or
another.
i
know
of
tons
of
land
that
i
can
walk
from
mississippi
into
louisiana,
but
at
one
end
of
it
is
a
mississippi
river.
that's
a
--
a
point
such
as
that
that
has
been
cut-off
at
its
neck,
but
of
course
as
the
river
thereafter
moves
while
there's
accretion
to
that,
as
there
is
to
the
other
and
it
must
always
be
adjacent
therefore
to
the
river.
and
i
therefore
know
of
none
that
is
completely
separated
as
they
have
sought
in
this
case
to
accomplish.
now,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
desire
to
leave
the
remainder
of
my
time
to
mr.
james
who
will
discuss
some
other
features
of
the
case.
