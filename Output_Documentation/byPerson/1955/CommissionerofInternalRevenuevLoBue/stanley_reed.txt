what
--
on
his
sale
of
that
stock?
justice
stanley

before
he
sells
it?
justice
stanley
reed
he
gets
--
he
gets
all
at
one
time?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
all
the
rest
he
exercised
at
one
time?
justice
stanley
reed
he
gave
no
indication
that
whether
he
would
or
wouldn't
take
it
until
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
until
just
before
january
1947?
justice
stanley
reed
clear
option
up
to
that
time.
justice
stanley

(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
but
not
binding
on
him?
justice
stanley
reed
just
like
he
bought
an
option
to
buy
the
cause,
something
like
that?
justice
stanley
reed
is
the
stock
putting
transfer
transferrable?
justice
stanley
reed
when
he
got
the
stock
it
was?
justice
stanley
reed
so,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
exercise
and
then
sell
the
stock?
justice
stanley
reed
where
is
that?
justice
stanley
reed
where
did
you
act
for
this?
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

somewhat
uncertain
about
just
exactly
this
contract,
as
i
understand
it
when
the
option
is
given
to
the
employee,
he
is
not
expected
to
exercise
it
at
all.
but
later
on,
after
he
had
performed
the
services
and
had
worked
hard
and
contributed,
then
the
directors
might
allot
to
him
some
of
his
10,000
shares,
but
he
was
not
given
an
option
the
day
that
the
first
letter
was
sent
for
so
many
shares.
justice
stanley
reed
no,
no,
but
he
--
even
leaving
aside
all
that,
he
only
got
an
option
to
buy
after
his
work
to
the
preceding
year
had
been
completed
and
then
the
directors
divided
some
of
the
shares,
i
don't
suppose
all
the
10,000
at
one
time
against
a
number
of
shares
among
x
number
of
people
at
the
end
of
the
work.
justice
stanley

--
justice

end
of
the
year.
so,
for
the
preceding
year
in
january,
they
allotted
so
many
shares
to
this
person
if
he
wanted
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
to
lessen
the
value.
