what
purpose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
appeared
that
he
work
harder
if
he
had
a
proprietary
interest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
there
was
no
gift?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
stock
worth
at
the
time
they
gave
the
offer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
was
the
option
value?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
the
option
price
is
in
$100,
and
the
actual
value
is
in
$5000?
do
you
say
that
would
be
no
gift,
no
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
words,
your
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
then
that
by
reason
of
the
closeness
of
the
option
price
to
the
extra
value.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
book
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then,
what
i
want
to
get
at,
how
much
is
it
conceded,
in
fact
the
worth,
and
how
much
was
the
option
price?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
at
the
time
they
gave
him
the
stock,
it
was
worth
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
time
they
gave
him
the
option.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
was
put
in
effect.
when
he
got
the
options,
did
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
get
more
than
his
money
is
worth
on
the
value
of
the
option?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
high?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
why
do
you
say
that
was
either
a
gift
or
a
payment
for
something
in
so
far
as
the
difference
between
the
values
is
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
intention
to
compensate
but
what
it
did
to
compensate
what
it
did
a
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
waste
--
waste
your
time
but
i
do
want
to
state
up
to
this
time,
my
trouble
with
your
case
is
this
that
reading
these
statements,
it
looks
to
me
like
they
said
in
effect,
“you're
a
good
employee.
we
want
you
to
be
more
loyal
and
do
harder
work
and
better
work,
and
we're
going
to
let
you
have
this
stock
at
an
option
whereby
you
make
$5000,
$6000
or
$2000
whatever
it
was,”
and
i
can't
get
to
see
how
they
could
find
that
they
didn't
go
for
that
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
--
i've
read
the
record
entirely
there.
i'm
not
sure
what
up-to-date
is,
i
can't
see
any
inference
on
the
other
side
unless
you're
going
to
say
they
won't
give
it
to
them.
i
can
see
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
can
understand
fully
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
your
case
where
at
the
time
the
gift
from
the
stock
option,
they
don't
make
it,
but
i
--
it's
a
little
different
for
me
to
see
why
you
sell
a
man
a
gold
dollar
for
50
cents,
you
would
need
to
give
him
something
or
give
him
--
or
hire
in
the
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
that
--
that's
--
i
can
understand
that
quarrel
and
if
it's
conclusive
presumption
where
--
where
they
were
not
getting
something,
or
nothing,
or
at
least
get
involved
in
the
money's
worth,
i
can
understand
that
as
far
as
the
presumption,
i
mean
the
regulation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
thing
that
hits
me
is
how
you
could
find
if
there's
another
gift
or
the
other.
i'm
sorry
for
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
time?
