mr.
philip
elman
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it's
a
federal
income
tax
case
and
presents
the
question,
whether
an
employee
of
a
corporation
who
receives
the
right
which
he
exercises
to
buy
stock
in
the
corporation
at
a
price,
which
is
considerably
lower
than
the
fair
market
price
of
the
stock
when
he
buys
it.
it's
taxable
on
the
gain
thus
realized.
in
other
words,
on
the
spread
between
what
the
corporation
sells
the
stock
to
him
for
and
what
the
corporation
would
receive
for
that
stock,
had
it
been
sold
on
the
open
market,
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
philip
elman
on
his
purchase
of
the
stock.
the
question
is
whether
the
employee
is
taxable
on
the
difference
between
what
he
pays
for
the
stock
to
the
corporation,
what
the
corporation
sells
it
to
him.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right,
sir,
on
the
--
on
his
exercise
of
the
option
right
given
to
him
by
the
corporation
on
the
purchase
of
the
stock.
now,
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
held
that
the
employee,
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
is
not
taxable
on
that
gain,
and
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts
which
are
in
the
main
stipulated.
this
agreement
here
as
in
the
lower
courts
centers
solely,
entirely
on
the
legal
validity
of
the
criteria
or
standards
used
by
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
no
tax
was
due
even
though
there
was
an
undoubted
economic
gain
or
benefit
received
by
the
employee
when
he
purchased
this
stock
at
the
favorable
price.
the
--
before
going
into
the
detailed
facts
of
the
case,
i
should
like
if
i
may,
in
order
to
put
the
legal
issue
in
the
proper
frame
of
reference,
to
refer
briefly
to
the
statutory
provision
which
all
agree
is
controlling
here,
that
section
22(a)
of
the
1939
revenue
code
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
at
page
2.
section
22
(a)
is
the
basic
definition
of
income.
it
provides
that
gross
income
includes
gains,
profits
and
income
derived
from
salaries,
wages
or
compensation
for
personal
service
and
the
material
that's
omitted
there
indicated
by
the
italics
is
just
a
parenthetical
clause
providing
that
--
including
personal
service
for
--
personal
services
rendered
by
officers
of
states,
or
compensation
for
personal
service
of
whatever
kind
and
in
whatever
form
paid.
and
it
goes
on
to
specify
various
categories
of
income,
and
there
is
a
concluding
catchall
clause
which
the
court
is
familiar
with.
that
was
before
the
court
in
last
term
in
the
so-called
windfall
cases,
the
glenshaw
and
general
american
investors
cases
involving
punitive
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
security
exchange
act.
the
catchall
clause,
or
gains
or
profits
and
--
and
income
derived
from
any
source
whatever.
and
as
the
court
has
noted
on
several
occasions
in
recent
terms
that
the
statutory
definition
of
income
is
so
broad
as
to
include
all
gains
and
only
those
gains
are
excluded
from
tax
which
congress
specifically
excludes.
and
we
have
set
out
here
the
provisions
of
section
22
(b)
(3),
which
provides
that
the
value
of
property
acquired
by
gift,
bequest,
devise
or
inheritance
shall
not
be
included
in
the
gross
income
and
shall
be
exempt
from
taxation
under
this
chapter.
the
comprehensiveness
of
the
--
of
the
statute
has
been
noted
not
only
in
the
cases
last
term,
but
also
in
--
in
cases
such
as
the
rankin
case
involving
illegally
extorted
payments
and
the
robertson
case
involving
a
prize
received
for
a
musical
composition.
but
perhaps,
the
most
important
case
in
this
context
is
the
case
of
commissioner
against
smith
in
324
u.s.
177
in
which
--
which
is
the
leading
case
dealing
with
taxability
of
gains
received
under
employee
stock
options
and
mr.
chief
justice
stone's
statement
in
that
opinion
has
been
frequently
quoted
that
section
22
(a)
is
broad
enough
to
include
any
gains
or
benefits
concertedly
conferred
on
employees
as
compensation,
whatever
the
form
or
mode
that
that
compensation
is
given.
now,
under
the
broad
statutory
provision
as
construed
by
the
court,
it's
therefore
immaterial
that
the
compensation
does
not
take
the
form
of
cash.
it
takes
the
form
of
property
and
merchandize
and
stocks,
or
bonds
or
whatnot.
it's
also
immaterial
that
the
compensation
is
not
given
pursuant
to
a
legal
obligation
or
contract
obligation.
it's
given
voluntarily
such
as
tips
or
christmas
bonus
or
something
of
that
sort.
it's
taxable
as
compensation
nonetheless,
and
it's
also
immaterial
that
the
compensation
takes
the
form
of
a
byproduct
of
what
might
be
called
a
noncompensatory,
non-compensation
motive
on
part
of
the
employer.
for
example,
in
the
robertson
case
where
the
taxpayer
was
held
to
realize
taxable
income,
what
he
received
was
a
prize
in
the
context
for
a
symphonic
composition.
the
donor
of
the
prize,
mr.
henry
reichhold
was
a
philanthropist.
and
his
interest
was
not
in
compensating
mr.
robertson.
his
interest
was
in
--
in
furthering
the
cause
of
symphonic
music
generally
and
the
particular
cause
of
the
detroit
symphony.
and
the
court
held
that
nevertheless,
since
the
payment
was
made
in
return
for
services
rendered,
it
was
taxable
as
income
regardless
of
mr.
reichhold's
motives.
as
another
example,
if
an
automobile
manufacturer
were
to
decide
for
purposes
of
publicity
or
advertising,
that
it
would
compensate
each
of
its
employees,
in
part
at
least
by
giving
them
a
new
car
each
year,
the
value
of
that
car
would
still
be
taxable
to
the
employee
even
though
an
incidental
purpose
was
served
by
the
employee
made
them
essential
requirements
of
this
new
employee's
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
finding
in
this
case,
sir,
are
based
on
what
we
conceive
to
be
an
erroneous
standard
that
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
fining
is
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
compensation
because
the
employer
intended
the
employee
to
acquire
a
proprietary
interest.
now,
we
say
that
the
tax
court
reached
the
wrong
conclusion,
made
the
wrong
finding
of
fact
because
it
asked
the
wrong
question.
we
don't
think
that
that
--
under
the
statute
that
is
the
test
and
i
shall
elaborate
my
argument
on
that.
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
do
so
after
going
into
the
details
of
the
facts.
now,
in
this
case,
the
tax
years
involved
are
1946
and
1947.
the
taxpayer
was
the
new
york
sales
manager
of
a
--
of
a
michigan
chemical
company,
a
rather
small
company
which
enjoyed
a
substantial
expansion
and
prosperity
in
the
immediate
post
war
period,
largely
as
a
result
of
its
sales
of
ddt
in
which
it
had
done
pioneering
work
for
the
army
beginning
early
in
1944.
in
march
1944,
the
stockholders
and
directors
of
the
company
apparently
realizing
that
it
was
on
the
brink
of
a
period
of
expansion,
decided
upon
a
plan
for
allocation
of
10,000
shares
of
common
stock
authorized
but
not
issued
to
the
--
to
such
key
employees
that
should
be
determined
by
the
board
of
directors
over
the
ensuing
three
years
and
the
option
price,
price
specified
was
$5,
which
at
that
time
was
slightly
more
than
the
market
price
of
the
stock.
there's
been
a
stipulation
that
march
1944
when
the
plan,
the
general
plan
was
agreed
upon,
the
price
was
$4.50.
excuse
me.
now,
on
june
29th
1944
and
i
shall
be
reading
from
the
record
beginning
at
page
17.
in
june
1944,
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
corporation,
a
man
named
t.c.
davis
wrote
to
the
taxpayer
that
--
informing
him
of
the
stockholder's
action
and
setting
aside
this
10,000
share
allocation.
he
stated
in
the
letter
that
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
provide
an
incentive
to
key
employees,
especially
to
permit
such
men
to
participate
in
the
success
of
the
company.
in
the
next
paragraph,
he
says,
“allotment
of
the
stock
will
be
made
by
the
committee
for
the
key
men
of
the
company
on
results
accomplished.
in
other
words,
you
will
stand
on
your
own
record
and
participate
in
the
stock
purchase
plan
to
the
extent
of
your
efforts,
cooperation,
and
results.
and
in
this
letter,
he
tells
him
that
he
has
been
tentatively
alloted
10
shares,
and
he
repeats
that
the
--
that
in
january
1945,
when
they
actually
make
the
--
the
final
allocation
to
particular
employees,
that
assignment
will
be
made
on
the
basis
of
results
accomplished.
i
am
now
reading
from
the
middle
of
page
18,
“you
may
be
assigned
a
greater
or
less
amount
of
stock
based
entirely
upon
your
individual
results
and
that
of
the
entire
organization.”
then,
it
goes
on
to
enumerate
the
basic
factors
which
will
be
taken
into
account,
the
labor
costs,
general
efficiency
in
operation,
increase
in
production
and
so
on.
and
mr.
davis
said,
“may
i
suggest
that
that
you
select
those
things
wherein
you
can
make
the
greatest
contribution
and
strive
to
make
the
kind
of
record
of
which
you
and
i
maybe
proud.”
then,
on
january
18th
1945,
mr.
davis
informs
the
taxpayer
that
he
has
been
definitely
alloted
150
shares.
and
he
says,
this
is
in
the
middle
of
page
19,
“that
this
allotment
of
stock
is
made
by
the
committee
and
is
in
recognition
of
your
contribution
and
efforts
in
making
the
operation
of
the
company
successful,”
and
he
concludes
that
letter.
on
top
of
page
20,
you'll
of
course
understand
that
further
allotments
of
stock
under
our
plan
will
be
recommended
by
the
committee
during
1945
and
1946.
it
is
up
to
you
to
justify
your
participation
in
the
plan
during
the
next
two
years.
in
january
1946,
once
again,
mr.
davis
writes
to
inform
mr.
lobue
that
he
has
received
a
further
allotment
of
150
shares.
and
in
the
paragraph
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
20,
he
says,
“the
committee's
selection
of
the
names
of
employees
to
receive
the
right
to
purchase
this
stock,
the
number
of
shares
assigned
to
each
selectee
is
determined
by
the
committee
after
a
careful
appraisal
of
the
individual's
contribution
to
the
company
in
the
way
of
job
performance
during
the
past
year.
in
other
words,
the
extent
of
your
participation
to
the
plan
is
based
on
how
well
you
handle
your
job
during
the
year.”
then,
in
january
1947,
mr.
lobue
is
alloted
40
shares
which
represented
his
portion
of
the
balance
of
the
shares
which
have
been
available,
and
this
letter
too
contains
statements
that
the
allocations
were
made
after
a
careful
appraisal
of
his
contribution
and
it
concludes,
“i
congratulate
you
on
having
earned
this
recognition
given
to
you
by
the
committee
and
trust
that
your
future
services,
suggestions
and
interest
in
the
corporation's
welfare
will
warrant
even
greater
recognition.”
now,
mr.
lobue
exercised
his
rights
under
these
three
options
by
purchasing
300
shares
of
stock
in
1946
at
a
time
when
the
market
price
of
the
stock
was
$30.50
a
share.
his
--
he
paid
$5
a
share,
which
meant
that
for
$1500,
he
acquired
stock
worth
$9600,
and
the
value
of
that
gain,
perhaps,
can
be
measured
by
the
fact
that
his
regular
salary
was
$6600
a
year.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
he
didn't
get
it
all
in
one
time.
he
got
it
--
he
got
--
he
exercised
his
option
under
the
third
option,
the
40
shares
in
february
1947.
at
that
time,
the
stock
was
worth
somewhere
around
$19.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
he
exercised
his
--
the
first
two
options
at
one
time.
there
were
three
options.
he
exercised
the
first
two
options
by
--
by
paying
for
the
--
by
paying
for
the
purchase
price
of
the
stock
in
february
1946.
now,
i
might
--
may
say
that
there
is
a
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
the
exercise
of
the
option
may
not
have
occurred
in
an
earlier
period
in
1945
when
the
taxpayer
gave
some
promissory
notes.
that
question
was
not
reached
by
the
tax
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
because
on
the
view
the
tax
court
took,
there
was
no
compensation
at
any
time
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
shares
of
stock.
so
that
we
--
we
would
suppose
that
that
question
will
--
will
be
open
to
the
taxpayer
on
remand
if
the
government's
contention
should
prevail
and
the
judgment
should
be
reversed,
but
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
your
honors
to
reach
that
question
here.
now,
i
might
--
i
might
also
mention
although
it's
--
mr.
philip
elman
until
he
gave
the
promissory
notes.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
when
the
--
when
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
was
a
clear
option
i
assume
was
binding
on
a
corporation.
there
is
no
suggestion
it
wasn't.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir,
there
is
no
question
about
that
i
assume
but
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
oh,
certainly
not.
if
the
stock
had
gone
down,
he
certainly
would
not
have
exercised
it.
it
was
--
it
was
contingent
in
that
sense.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
i
--
i
would
suppose
that
there
would
be
no
difference
from
our
point
of
view
whether
it
was
going
to
--
whether
it
was
put
in
colony
or
not.
it
was
--
there
was
certainly
no
obligation
on
him
to
exercise
the
option
basically.
now,
i
might
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
options
were
not
transferrable,
mr.
justice.
there
--
there
has
never
been
any
suggestion
in
this
case
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
brief
on
the
merits
of
this
court
by
the
respondent
that
the
receipt
of
the
option
itself
might
be
compensation.
in
fact,
contention
had
been
reached
--
had
been
made.
it
certainly
should
have
been
considered
by
the
tax
court
because
it's
--
it's
clear
that
if
--
if
an
option
has
value
and
if
it's
assignable,
there
is
a
determinable
market
value
that
it
has.
it's
a
piece
of
property
in
which
it
--
if
it's
--
if
that
were
intended
to
be
compensation
under
the
smith
case,
the
tax
could
be
imposed,
but
i
had
--
i
don't
think
that
question
is
in
this
case.
it
--
it
was
never
in
the
case
until
it
was
brought
into
it
by
the
respondent,
his
brief
on
the
merits.
and
since
the
option
was
not
transferable,
it's
hard
to
see
how
any
market
value
could
have
been
given
to
it.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
the
--
it
was
not
transferable
because
the
--
the
option
--
the
option
specifically
provided
that
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
davis
told
mr.
lobue
that
one
of
the
conditions
was
that
the
option,
the
right
to
purchase
the
stock,
is
not
transferrable.
he
couldn't
give
it
to
anyone
else.
mr.
philip
elman
he
could
exercise.
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
sell
a
stock.
he
could
have
held
on
to
it.
for
all
i
know,
he
has
held
onto
it.
there's
nothing
on
the
record
on
that.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
the
--
the
question
as
to
whether
the
compensation
was
the
option
or
was
the
exercise
of
the
option
resulting
in
his
acquisition
of
shares
of
stock.
it
was
the
question
that
was
before
this
court
in
the
smith
case
and
there,
it
was
--
there,
the
option
when
it
was
received
had
no
value
because
the
market
price
was
not
in
excess
of
the
option
price
and
the
--
this
court
said,
“well,
in
no
circumstances,
certainly,
the
--
the
mere
receipt
of
the
option
couldn't
have
been
intended
to
be
the
compensation.
it
was
the
exercise
of
the
option
that
was
the
compensation.
well,
the
tax
court
in
the
court
of
appeals
has
been
pointed
out.
it
held
that
in
this
case,
there
was
no
compensation.
it's
a
finding
of
fact,
no
compensation
and
we
are
not
challenging
the
evidence,
the
evidentiary
basis
for
lack
of
it
from
such
a
finding.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
wrong
test.
now,
the
test
that
was
applied
is
known
as
the
proprietary
interest
versus
compensation
test,
and
it
--
it's
fairly
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
160,
judge
maris
points
out
that
a
virtually
unbroken
line
of
cases
supports
the
tax
court
in
holding
that
if
the
--
now,
we
disagree
with
judge
maris
as
the
authority,
but
that's
not
material
at
this
point,
the
cases
support
the
tax
court
in
holding
that
if
the
grant
of
a
stock
option
by
a
corporation
to
its
employee
is
intended
as
additional
compensation
to
him,
the
excess
of
the
fair
market
value
over,
the
option
price
is
income
taxable
to
him
when
the
option
is
exercised.
now,
that
--
that
certainly
can't
be
disputed.
but
he
goes
on
to
say,
“but
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
grant
of
the
option
is
intended
to
provide
him
with
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
business,
no
taxable
gain
is
recognized
when
the
option
is
exercised,
and
whether
the
grant
of
the
option
is
the
one
or
the
other
being
in
every
case
a
question
of
fact.
so,
the
question
is
under
the
view
,taken
by
the
--
of
the
law
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
tax
court,
you
asked
was
this
intended
to
his
compensation?
if
so,
taxed.
was
it
intended
as
to
give
the
employee
a
proprietary
interest?
it's
not
taxed.
and
curiously,
in
--
in
almost
every
opinion
that
i
have
examined
on
this
subject,
the
--
the
latter
question
is
asked
first,
if
the
--
if
the
employer
is
found
to
have
intended
the
employee
to
acquire
proprietary
interest
in
the
company.
that
is
conclusive
of
the
question
of
whether
there
was
compensation.
now,
that
--
that
is
the
approach
that
was
taken
by
the
tax
court
in
this
case,
and
that
was
the
--
apparently
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
we
--
our
difficulty
with
the
proprietary
interest
test
begins
with
our
--
our
inability
to
find
any
statutory
authority
for
it.
under
the
--
under
the
rule
of
the
court
of
appeals,
there's
a
--
there
is
a
middle
ground
between
taxable
compensation
on
the
one
hand
and
a
nontaxable
gift
on
the
other
hand.
right
in
the
middle
is
an
area
of
a
benefit
or
gain
received
by
an
employee
which
isn't
taxable
to
him
not
because
it's
a
gift.
there's
no
--
there's
no
finding
here
of
a
gift,
no
argument
of
a
gift,
not
because
it's
a
gift,
but
because
of
the
existence
of
this
intention
on
the
part
of
the
employer
that
by
acquiring
the
stock
in
the
corporation,
the
employee
should
have
a
proprietary
interest.
mr.
philip
elman
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
that
the
analysis
of
the
conception
of
a
proprietary
interest
that
is
accepted
by
lower
courts
is
--
is
really
incomplete,
because
almost
every
time,
every
time
i
should
say,
a
corporation
sells
stock.
it's
implicit
in
the
transaction
that
the
purchaser
acquires
proprietary
interest.
that's
--
that's
just
--
that's
particularly
true
in
a
case
where
the
--
where
the
corporation
sets
a
price
which
is,
for
its
stock,
which
is
lower
than
that
on
the
market.
now,
when
a
--
when
a
corporation
offers
stock
to
its
employees
or
to
some
of
them
at
a
substantial
discount
to
say
that
it
intends
the
employees
to
acquire
proprietary
interest,
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
why
it
so
intends
and
what
the
corporation
receives
in
return.
why
the
corporation
should
wish
to
sell
its
stock
at
less
than
what
it
can
get
in
the
marketplace?
and
--
and
it
seems
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
regulations
adopted
by
the
treasury
are
reasonable
and
--
and
valid
in
providing
that
unless
it's
found
to
be
a
gift,
unless
you
find
that
the
employer
was
motivated
by
considerations
of
affection,
their
friendship
and
so
on,
the
--
the
reason
why
he
wishes
the
--
the
employee
to
acquire
the
stock
is
to
improve
the
employee's
interest
in
his
work,
his
devotion,
his
morale,
whatever
it
be
called.
there
is
a
relationship
between
--
between
giving
him
a
discount
and
his
services,
which
should
be
taxable
as
compensation
even
though
it
takes
the
form
of
stock
rather
than
cash.
mr.
philip
elman
that's
set
forth
in
our
brief
beginning
at
page
3.
i
should
say
our
principle
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
--
the
number
that
is,
unless
--
unless
it's
a
gift
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
unless
it's
a
gift
--
unless
it's
a
gift,
if
--
if
property
is
transferred
by
a
corporation
to
its
employee,
it's
taxable
to
the
extent
of
the
difference
between
the
--
mr.
philip
elman
tax
court
thought
that
that
regulation
had
a
kind
of
automatic
conclusive
presumption
effect
that
it
precluded
any
inquiry
into
the
fact.
i
think
it
was
a
--
that
was
a
misconstruction
regulation.
it
is
not
our
position
that
there
is
anything
automatic
about
this.
there
is
--
there
are
questions
of
fact
where
the
issue
is
raised
as
that
the
gain
was
intended
as
a
gift,
but
we
think
that
where
that
--
where
the
question
is
answered
in
the
negative,
this
--
the
normal
presumption
of
compensation
has
nothing
over
to
come
and
it
should
be
taxable
as
such.
before
i
sit
down,
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention,
the
provisions
of
the
1950
amendment
of
the
tax
law.
in
1950,
congress
in
response
to
the
suggestion
that
the
treasuries
regulations
resulted
in
--
in
employees
who
have
received
such
option
being
compelled
to
sell,
to
sell
stock
in
order
to
pay
taxes,
congress
responded
to
that
argument
to
a
very
limited
extend.
it
--
it
set
up
a
category
of
restricted
stock
options.
mr.
philip
elman
pardon.
mr.
philip
elman
we
have
not
set
forth
the
1950
act
in
the
statutes
involved
section,
sir,
because
this
act
--
this
--
the
--
the
act
is
not
involved
strictly
speaking.
that's
a
1950
act,
and
the
reason
i
mentioned
it
is
that
if
the
court
below
in
this
case
is
right,
it
creates
a
real
incongruity
in
the
tax
law
because
under
the
1950
act,
the
restrictive
stock
option
is
defined
as
one
in
which
the
option
price
was
at
least
85%
of
the
market
price
at
the
time
it
was
given.
it-s
--
it's
an
option
which
can
be
exercised
only
during
employment.
the
--
the
stock
has
to
be
held
for
at
least
two
years
after
the
option
is
given
or
six
months
after
the
option
is
exercised.
the
employee
can't
hold
more
than
10%
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation.
it's
not
transferable
and
so
on.
there
are
quite
a
number
of
restrictions
that
have
to
be
met.
and
if
all
those
conditions
are
met,
then
under
the
1950
statute,
the
employee
does
not
pay
a
tax
when
he
buys
the
stock,
but
when
he
sells
it.
but
then,
he
is
taxed
at
the
ordinary
income
tax
rates
to
the
extent
of
the
difference
between
the
option
price
and
the
market
price,
and
the
statute
further
provides
that
unlike
this
case,
no
deduction
can
be
taken
by
the
corporation
and
there
is
a
further
provision
which
i
think
is
especially
important.
if
the
employee
dies
without
selling
the
stock,
his
estate
has
to
pay
an
income
tax
just
if
he
had
sold
it
during
his
lifetime.
now,
under
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
this
case,
the
practical
result
is
that
the
employee,
when
he
buys
the
--
when
he
buys
the
stock,
pays
no
stock
at
all.
if
he
dies
without
selling
the
stock,
his
estate
pays
no
tax
because
they
take
it
on
the
basis
of
its
market
value
at
the
time
of
his
death.
if
he
does
sell
it
during
his
lifetime,
he
is
taxed
at
the
ordinary
--
at
the
long-term
capital
gain
rate,
and
the
difference
between
the
result
in
this
case
which
turns
on
the
existence
of
a
proprietary
interest
motive
and
the
1950
amendment
in
which
there
is
no
reference
at
all
for
proprietary
interest,
the
only
conditions
are
those
that
i
have
enumerated,
seems
to
us
to
be
highly
significant.
mr.
philip
elman
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know
if
my
time
is
up.
i
believe
i
have
an
--
mr.
philip
elman
in
very
brief
points,
i
should
like
to
make
first
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
in
response
to
mr.
justice
black's
questions
to
mr.
barrett.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
29
the
option
prices,
the
fair
market
value
in
issue,
fair
market
and
the
fair
market
value
inquired.
the
300
shares
of
stock
were
acquired
in
february
1946.
the
option
price
was
$5
a
share
at
that
time.
it
remained
$5
of
course,
and
the
fair
market
value
was
$30.50
–-
mr.
philip
elman
at
that
time.
and
in
january
1947
as
to
the
40
shares,
option
price
still
is
$5,
fair
market
value
$19.50.
i
should
like
to
make
the
further
point,
sir,
that
we
do
not
say
that
there
is
a
conclusive
presumption
that
when
--
when
stock
is
purchased
at
a
favorable
price
by
an
employee
that
it's
taxable.
the
regulation
has
expressly
recognize
that
where
the
transaction
is
exempt
from
taxation
by
law
as
in
the
case
of
a
gift,
then
certainly
intention
is
very
material.
if
that
issue
is
tendered
as
it
was
not
in
this
case,
but
if
it
were
tendered,
the
issue
should
certainly
be
a
canvass,
intention
to
make
a
gift
if
found
by
the
triers
of
fact
and
if
that
finding
is
supported
by
the
evidence,
of
course,
established
as
a
gift.
if
those
questions
of
fact,
as
what
--
that
this
court
is
indicating
a
whole
line
of
cases
from
the
jacobson
case
and
the
robertson
case
going
on
back
to
(inaudible)
and
old
colony
trust
company,
was
--
was
this
given
as
an
act
of
generosity,
was
it
motivated
by
affection,
friendship,
charity?
mr.
philip
elman
not
at
all,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
it
may
be,
it
may
be
that
where
there
is
a
gift,
there's
an
--
mr.
philip
elman
our
difficulty
--
mr.
philip
elman
our
difficulty
is
that
which
was
expressed
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
don't
see
how
the
intention
to
convey
property
to
give
the
employee
a
proprietary
stake
in
the
business
is
inconsistent
with
--
with
compensation
any
more
than
it's
inconsistent
with
gift.
mr.
philip
elman
we
find
compensation
and
gift
in
the
statute,
but
we
don't
find
proprietary
interest.
mr.
philip
elman
and
if
the
right
questions
have
been
asked
here,
was
there
an
intention
to
compensate,
was
there
an
intention
to
make
a
gift,
this
case
would
not
be
here.
thank
you
very
much.
