mr.
richard
f.
barrett
there
are
two
basic
questions
presented
in
this
case.
the
first
is,
is
there
a
presumption
under
section
22
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
a
conclusive
presumption
that
stock
options
are
granted
to
employees
for
one
reason
only,
to
compensate?
the
commissioner
says,
and
as
regulation
say,
that
there
is
such
a
conclusive
presumption
that
the
courts
are
precluded
from
looking
into
the
true
intent
of
the
transaction.
the
taxpayer
says,
“there
is
no
such
conclusive
presumption
and
that
if
it
is
established
as
a
fact
that
there
is
no
purpose
to
compensate
through
the
transaction,
then
the
exercise
of
the
option
represents
a
mere
purchase
of
property.”
the
tax
court
found
that
there
was
no
intention
to
compensate.
it
did
not
find,
as
my
brother
has
said,
that
there
was
no
intention
to
compensate
because
there
was
an
intention
to
give
a
proprietary
interest.
it
laid
out
very
expressly
and
clearly
of
the
criteria
that
if
there
is
any
intention
to
compensate,
then
there
is
compensation.
but
if
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
intent
to
compensate
and
there
happens
to
be
another
motive,
which
is
the
wish
to
sell
stock
to
the
employee,
then
the
sale
is
a
pure
sale.
the
second
question
is
whether
this
finding
of
the
tax
court,
which
is
concurred
in
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
will
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
of
course,
it's
a
conclusive
presumption
of
the
commissioner's
regulations
as
upheld,
then,
this
court
has
no
place
for
such
a
review.
the
commissioner,
however,
argues
in
the
alternative
that
the
--
this
court
will
review
this
finding
of
fact
and
that
it
should
reverse
it
as
erroneous.
the
taxpayer
contends
that
it
is
not
subject
to
review
here
under
well
established
principles
of
this
court,
that
such
a
two-court
finding
of
fact
will
not,
under
section
--
rule
52
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
be
reviewed
except
in
the
presence
of
very
exceptional
circumstances
which
are
not
present
here.
now,
it
has
been
stated
that
the
taxpayer
contends
there
is
conclusive
presumption.
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
for
the
gist
of
the
regulations.
they
were
not
stated
exactly
as
i
understand
them
to
be.
they
lay
down
a
flat
mandate
without
any
exception
to
the
gift.
all
words
relating
to
love
and
affection,
they
state,
and
this
appears
at
page
5
of
the
commissioner's
brief,
the
top
of
page
5,
“if
property
is
transferred
by
an
employer
to
an
employee
for
an
amount,”
this
is
any
property,
stock,
or
any
other
property,
“for
an
amount
less
than
its
fair
market
value,
regardless
of
whether
the
transfer
is
in
the
form
of
a
sale
or
exchange.
the
difference
between
the
amount
paid
for
the
property
and
the
amount
of
its
fair
market
value
is
in
the
nature
of
compensation
and
shall
be
included
in
the
gross
income
of
the
employee.”
and
those
are
the
only
words
in
the
statute,
in
the
regulation,
which
is
significant
to
this
case
that
bear
upon
today.
if
the
fact
establishes
that
there
is
no
purpose
to
compensate,
the
taxpayer
says,
“it's
a
transaction
purchase,
a
purchase
transaction.”
once
this
absence
of
intent
to
compensate
is
established,
the
employee
relationship
becomes
insignificant
and
the
employee
stands
in
the
same
position
as
any
other
purchaser
of
property.
this
view
has
been
consistently
supported
by
the
courts
including
this
court.
in
smith
against
the
united
states,
to
which
my
brother
referred,
this
court
held
that
the
exercise
of
an
option
by
an
employee
resulted
in
compensation
on
the
expressed
grounds
that
the
option
was
given
in
consideration
to
services.
in
palmer
against
the
united
states,
302
u.s.
63,
an
advantageous
exercise
by
stockholders
of
an
option
granted
to
them
was
held
by
this
court
not
to
create
a
dividend
since
the
purpose
and
intention
of
the
grinding
of
the
option
was
not
to
distribute
earnings.
the
palmer
case
is
of
special
significance
here
because
of
the
high
degree
of
analogy
in
fact
in
the
issues
of
the
cases
to
the
present
case.
in
both
cases,
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
option
plan,
market
value
was
either
equal
to
or
greater
than
as
is
true
in
this
case,
the
option
price
in
both
cases
when
the
option
was
exercised,
market
price
was
in
excess
of
the
price
paid
pursuant
to
the
option.
this
court
said
in
the
palmer
case,
“that
one
does
not
subject
himself
to
income
tax
by
the
mere
purchase
of
property
even
at
less
than
its
true
value
and
the
taxable
gain
does
not
accrue
to
him
before
he
sells
or
otherwise
discloses
of
it.”
the
commissioner
contended
that
this
discount
in
the
palmer
case
represented
a
dividend
to
the
stockholders.
this
was
rejected
by
the
court
on
the
grounds,
the
expressed
grounds
that
there
was
no
purpose
or
intention
to
distribute
a
dividend.
this
is
precisely
the
principle
that
the
lower
courts
have
applied
in
this
case
and
in
all
other
stock
option
cases
involving
employees.
but
the
commissioner
argues
that
purpose
and
intention
are
immaterial
where
there
is
the
employee
relationship
that
the
courts,
if
there
such
a
relationship
precluded
from
looking
in
to
the
question
of
intent.
the
influence
of
the
employee
relationship
is
so
overriding
in
the
view
of
the
commissioner
as
to
require
a
complicit
presumption
of
law
that
compensation
is
involved.
now,
this
court
has,
on
many
occasions,
expressed
that
this
favor
was
statutory
conclusive
presumptions.
as
in
violation
of
the
due
process
provisions
of
the
fifth
and
fourth
amendments,
i
do
not
cite
these
cases
in
my
brief,
so
i
like
to
take
the
liberty
of
citing
three
of
the
leading
cases
at
this
time,
helvering
against
rankin,
295
u.s.
123,
heiner
against
donnan,
285
u.s.
312,
hoeper
against
tax
commission,
284
u.s.
206.
certainly,
regulations,
which
attempt
to
provide
a
conclusive
presumption,
must
themselves
be
arbitrary
and
invalid.
now,
the
commissioner's
conception
of
the
law
has
not
always
been
as
it
is
now.
from
1939
to
1946,
his
regulations
regarding
employee
stock
options
provided
that
compensation
was
a
question
of
fact.
he
also
applied
the
same
factual
test
in
his
regulations
regarding
stockholder's
stock
options.
he
also
expressed
this
view
in
his
brief
in
the
smith
case
to
which
we
have
referred
before.
at
page
14
of
his
brief,
the
commissioner
stated,
“in
determining
whether
a
particular
transaction
involved,”
this
is
his
--
this
is
his
brief
in
the
smith
case,
previously
before
this
court
where
he
expressed
this
view
of
the
transaction
compared
to
what
he
is
expressing
now.
“in
determining
whether
a
particular
transaction
involves
the
payment
of
compensation
for
personal
services,
the
decisive
factor
is
that
of
intention.”
this
is
of
course
a
question
of
fact.
this
is
exactly
the
position
of
the
courts
below
in
this
case
and
in
all
other
stock
option
cases
of
employees
and
it's
the
taxpayer's
position
here.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
he
changed
his
view
in
1946
for
what
represents
one
of
the
great
mysteries
of
the
tax
field.
he
dated
the
options
on
the
same
date.
i
mean
the
change
in
the
regulations
on
the
same
date.
the
effective
date
of
them
was
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
smith
case.
and
the
smith
case
offers
no
discernible
basis
for
a
chain
from
a
determination
of
fact
as
to
whether
compensation
exist
to
a
determination
to
a
conclusive
presumption
that
it
does,
because
in
the
smith
case,
this
court
said
the
options
resulted
in
compensation
because
they
were
as
a
fact
given
in
consideration
for
services.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
fact
was
admitted
and
conceded
in
the
tax
court
and
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
case
came
to
this
court
on
the
fact
that
the
options
were
given
as
compensation
for
service.
now,
he
also
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
yes,
mr
justice
frankfurter.
he
becomes
a
partner
in
the
business.
he
is
one
of
the
owners
as
a
(voice
overlap)
to
an
employee.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
very
true,
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
very
true,
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
then
traditionally
and
historically,
based
on
this
court's
view
in
the
palmer
case
and
other
cases,
the
question
is,
what
was
the
intention
involved?
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
and
there
was
knowledge.
under
the
jacobson
case
before
this
court,
it's
cited
in
my
brief.
i
can't
remember
the
volume
and
page
at
the
moment.
if
there
was
no
attempt
by
the
seller
to
get
all
that
he
could
for
the
property,
it
was
a
gift
for
income
tax
purposes
and
exempt.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
my
remarks
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
and
go
on
to
the
change
in
1946
and
the
regulations
where
this
change
was
made
to
a
conclusive
presumption
that
because
of
the
employer
relationship,
there
must
be
compensation
in
every
stock
option
case.
the
interesting
point
about
that
is,
at
the
same
time,
there
was
no
change
made
in
the
stockholder
option
regulations
that
related
to
dividends.
those
remained
the
same
that
it
would
still
open
the
question
of
facts
just
as
to
whether
the
purpose
and
intention
was
to
declare
a
dividend.
there
seems
to
be
a
rather
hypnotic
influence
exercised
on
the
commissioner
by
the
employee
relationship,
one
and
one
makes
two
for
a
stockholder,
but
the
same
in
the
case
of
an
employee
makes
three.
the
regulations
admit
of
no
exception.
now,
the
commissioner
does
do
lip
service
in
this
case
in
his
argument,
not
in
these
regulations
to
one
exception,
gift,
but
it's
through
lip
service
because
the
whole
rationale
of
his
argument
is
that
if
you're
an
employee,
the
employer
will
not
make
a
gift
to
you.
however,
he
says
there's
no
middle
ground
that
may
not
be
a
purchase
transaction
such
as
this
case
held
there
could
be
if
that
is
the
intent
and
purpose
in
the
palmer
case.
now,
the
logical
invalidity
of
the
commissioner's
position
can
be
illustrated
by
a
rather
homely
and
down
to
earth
illustration.
corporation
x,
which
is
a
closely
held
corporation
and
whose
stock
has
no
established
market
value,
announces
to
all
its
employees
that
the
stockholders
are
making
an
offer
to
them
that
they
may
buy
a
stock
for
a
period
of
three
months
at
the
market
price
for
the
stock.
the
announcement
states
that
this
is
in
response
to
request
from
employees
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
become
stockholders.
and
the
stockholders
think
that
it
would
be
sound
for
the
corporation
to
have
its
employees
participate
in
the
stock
ownership.
the
announcement
also
states
that
because
of
the
unestablished
market
value
of
the
stock,
three
independent
competent
appraisers
will
be
selected
to
determine
the
market
value.
many
of
the
stockholders
accept
the
offer,
and
in
each
case,
the
fair
market
value
which
is
to
be
the
purchase
price,
is
determined
on
a
bonafide
careful
basis
by
this
committee
of
independent,
expert
and
competent
appraisers.
some
stockholders
turned
down
this
opportunity
because
they
object
to
the
price
determined
as
being
too
high.
the
commissioner,
using
capitalization
of
earnings
and
book
value
and
other
evaluation
formula
methods,
determines
that
the
market
price
is
an
excess
of
that
for
which
the
stock
was
sold,
and
the
tax
court
uphold
this
determination.
now,
under
the
regulations,
that
discount
for
market
is
conclusively
presumed
to
be
compensation.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
no
gift
is
involved.
it
is
also
--
it's
equally
clear
that
the
stock
option
was
granted
because
of
the
employee
relationship,
but
it
certainly
is
equally
clear
that
there
was
no
intention
to
compensate.
it
was
merely
an
intention
to
make
the
sale
of
stock,
but
because
the
sale
was
at
a
market
price,
in
excess
of
the
option
price,
the
commissioner
says
there
is
a
conclusive
presumption
of
compensation.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
no
gift
because
there
was
an
effort
made
on
the
part
of
the
seller,
the
corporation,
to
get
all
that
it
could
in
the
transaction.
that's
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
jacobson
case.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
the
independent
investment
experts
appraise
the
stock
at
--
we
will
say
$100
a
share.
there
is
no
established
market
value,
your
honor,
so
they
had
to
do
it
by
appraisal.
the
commissioner
came
in
and
said,
“i
say
it's
worth
a
$125
a
share,”
and
the
tax
court
upheld
it
to
make
a
simpler
illustration.
the
tax
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
the
option
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
--
the
option
price
was
$100
a
share,
the
fair
market
value.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
no,
i
would
say
there
that
i
would
conceive
that
there
was
obviously
a
purpose
of
compensating
the
employee.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
if
there
is,
if
--
if
it
is
shown
as
a
fact
that
the
purpose
is
to
compensate
then
your
illustration
would
certainly
demonstrate
it
conclusively
then
there
is
compensation.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
my
argument
in
the
--
in
the
hypothetical
case
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
seller
made
every
effort
to
determine
by
independent
appraisers
how
much
the
stock
was
worth.
he
had
no
listing
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
to
look
at.
it
was
an
untraded
stock.
he
made
every
effort
of
other
formula
devices
used
by
the
commissioner
and
upheld
by
the
tax
court
say,
“no
our
guess
is
that
it's
worth
more.”
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
i
was
giving
a
hypothetical
–-
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
oh,
here,
i
do
not
know.
there's
--
there's
no
issue
on
facts
as
to
evaluation
here.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
at
the
time
that
the
option
plan
was
adopted,
the
price
was
--
the
--
the
stock
was
worth
$4.50
a
share
and
the
option
price
was
$5.
the
plan
was
to
sell
it
above
the
option
--
above
market.
now
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
at
the
time
they
gave
him
the
--
at
the
time
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
at
the
time
they
gave
him
the
option,
the
market
price
had
become
higher
than
the
option
price,
but
the
time
that
the
plan
was
adopted,
the
market
was
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
market
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
the
market
was
higher
than
the
option
price,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
i
think
in
one
case,
in
one
option,
a
$1.5
from
$5
to
6.50
in
another.
i
think
from
$5
to
$19.50.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
i
say
because
there
was
no
intention
to
compensate.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
they
adopted
the
plan.
they
didn't
know
what
the
price
was
going
to
be
when
the
options
were
granted.
they
adopted
a
plan.
the
stockholders
said
to
the
directors,
“you
take
these
10,000
shares
and
you
select
employees
that
are
key
employees
in
the
company
and
you
give
them
this
option
to
buy.”
the
whole
plan
was
fixed.
the
only
thing
that
was
left
open
was
who
is
going
to
be
selected,
not
whether
anyone
would
be
selected.
and
at
that
time,
the
price
of
the
stock
was
--
the
stock
was
worth
less
than
the
price
of
the
option.
now,
at
a
later
time,
when
the
selections
have
been
made
and
the
plan
had
been
carried
through
at
that
point,
the
stock
had
gone
up.
but
a
host
of
cases
below
without
any
exception
have
said
that
if
under
these
circumstances,
if
the
purpose
of
the
whole
transaction
was
not
to
pass
out
compensation
it's
merely
an
arrangement
to
sell
property.
and
that
the
time
to
impose
the
tax
is
after
you
bought
the
property
and
you
sold
it
and
you
find
out
how
much
you
eventually
net
out
of
the
transaction.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
well,
i
mean
the
--
the
record
of
course
is
open
in
result
of
the
tax
court
to
look
at
all
of
the
facts
as
to
whether
the
inferences,
perhaps
on
both
sides,
led
to
the
finding
of
facts
that
the
company
was
not
intending
to
compensate
or
whether
it
was
intending
to
compensate.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
well,
in
the
palmer
case,
we
have
no
gift.
we
have
a
corporation
issuing
options
to
stockholders
to
buy
a
property
at
a
certain
price.
it
wasn't
an
excessive
market.
by
the
time
they
got
the
options
and
exercised
them,
the
price
of
the
--
the
market
price
had
gone
up.
this
court
said,
“there
wasn't
any
purpose
here
to
compensate,
to
declare
a
dividend.
the
purpose
was
merely
to
sell
a
property.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
they
said
nothing.
but
what
my
point
is,
your
honor,
that
there
was
nothing
said
about
gift.
there
was
a
middle
ground
that
the
commissioner
says
can
exist
to
purchase
transaction.
that's
what
the
palmer
case
held
that
you
can
have
a
purchase
transaction
like
in
the
middle
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
well,
if
--
if
the
seller
is
trying
to
get
all
he
can,
he
is
obviously
not
making
a
gift.
if
he
happens
not
to
get
all
that
he
can,
he
is
obviously
in
the
illustration
i
gave,
not
trying
to
compensate
the
employee
because
he's
not
trying
to
sell
at
less
in
under
the
regulation
because
it
was
sold
at
less.
and
because
it
was
sold
to
an
employee
its
compensation,
we
quarrel
with
the
conclusive
presumption.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
well
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
if
i
can
be
--
if
i
can
be
helpful,
i'm
certainly
glad
to
discuss
it
i
don't
think
i
have
any
more
help
to
offer
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
no,
he
wasn't
given
the
option
because
they
had
to
get
the
thing
cleared
by
the
michigan
securities
commission
which
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
well,
of
course,
there
was
no
end
of
the
work
in
the
sense
that
his
work
continued,
we'll
say
at
the
end
of
the
calendar,
end
of
the
year.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
end
of
the
year.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
the
facts
as
to
the
terms
of
the
option
and
the
information
given
to
the
employee
by
the
--
by
mr.
davis,
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
the
president
of
the
company
is
given
by
--
my
colleague
here
is
highly
selective.
i
mean,
we
bring
forward
in
purpose
to
your
attention
in
our
brief
all
of
the
other
things
that
was
said
about.
we
want
you
to
be
a
stockholder.
you
should
take
pride
of
being
an
owner.
its
--
his
statement
over
here
was
heavily
weighed,
it
was
--
which
i
don't
object
at
all
towards
an
intention,
simply
to
pick
out
someone
who
worked
hard,
but
they
were
trying
to
pick
out
the
people
who
were
the
key
employees.
they
couldn't
do
it
blindfolded
and
just
walk
around
a
game
of
blind
man's
buff
picking
out
this
follow
and
that
in
the
dark
its
key
employees
and
give
them
the
option.
they
had
to
pick
out
people
on
merits
so
they
had
to
refer
to
the
good
job
they've
done
and
all
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
they
are
not
mutually
exclusive
and
they're
not
so
treated
in
the
courts
below.
i
think
we
can
dispose
of
that
by
simply
rating
the
rationale
of
criteria,
as
the
courts
below
call
it
of
the
geeseman
case,
a
38
b.t.a.
case
which
they've
expressly
adopted
in
which
they
said,
“this
is
the
criteria
we
applied.”
at
page
7
of
our
brief,
in
the
quotation
near
the
center
of
the
page,
each
court
applied
the
criteria
set
out
in
delbert
b.
geeseman,
“as
a
prerequisite
to
the
conclusion
sought
by
the
respondent,”
that's
the
commissioner,
which
as
his
--
what
he
seeks
is
to
be
a
compensation.
“it
should
definitely
and
clearly
appear
that
the
transaction,”
and
then
in
italics,
“is
in
fact
to
some
extent
the
payment
of
compensation
for
services
rendered
or
to
be
rendered.”
now,
if
--
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
no,
they
acted
on
oral
testimony?
mr.
richard
f.
barrett
by
the
president
of
the
company
and
the
president
who
conceived
the
plan.
in
my
remaining
moment
or
two,
may
i
turn
to
the
procedural
aspect
of
this,
if
it
please
the
court,
and
that
is
the
background
of
this
finding
of
fact
against
which
--
which
we
submit
the
court
should
review
this
case.
this
court
has
taken
the
position
repeatedly
that
a
two
court
finding
of
fact
is
not
reviewable
under
section
52
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
except,
and
these
are
the
words
of
this
court,
“in
the
presence
of
very
exceptional
and
obvious
error.”
now,
on
all
the
evidence
here
of
the
tax
court
including
the
un-rebutted
testimony
of
mr.
davis,
the
president
of
the
employer
corporation
found
that
there
was
no
purpose
to
compensate.
and
the
court
of
appeals
concurred
without
any
qualification.
so,
we
have
here
a
question
of
whether
a
regulatory
fiat
that
the
acquisition,
the
advantageous
purchase
of
stock
by
every
employee
from
an
employer
is
compensation,
simply
because
of
the
employee
relationship,
whether
because
of
such
a
--
such
a
conclusive
presumption,
the
courts
are
barred
from
enquiring
into
the
true
facts
as
to
the
intention
and
motives.
and
really,
whether
it's
compared
to
stockholders,
employees
are
somewhat
second
class
taxpayers
in
the
sense
that
they
cannot
buy
property
from
their
employer
corporation
if
that
is
the
--
that
there
is
no
purpose
to
compensate.
