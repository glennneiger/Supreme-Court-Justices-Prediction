chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
docket,
dantan
george
rea
versus
united
states
of
america.
mr.
sommer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
take
it,
mr.
sommer,
that
if
there
was
a
state
agent
present
at
the
time
this
property
was
seized
and
--
and
he
wanted
--
was
subpoenaed
to
testify
in
the
state
court,
the
action
you
seek
would
not
--
would
not
prevent
him
from
--
from
testifying,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
testifies
to
what
he
saw
and
--
and
he
is
not
a
state
agent
and
not
a
federal
agent,
and
you
have
sought
only
to
enjoin
the
federal
agent,
have
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
so
if
--
if
a
state
agent
or
a
--
or
a
private
individual
happened
to
see
what
was
going
on
at
this
time
and
testified
before
the
state
court,
the
--
the
remedy
that
you
seek
here
would
not
--
would
not
prevent
the
state
court
from
using
that
testimony,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
what
i
--
that's
what
i
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
seek
that
remedy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
seek
to
tie
the
hands
of
the
state
court
insofar
as
using
any
--
any
evidence
that
was
available
to
it
under
state
rules.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
rosenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sommer,
did
you
have
something
more?
chief
justice
earl
warren

you.
