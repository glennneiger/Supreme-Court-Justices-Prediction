ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
will
perhaps
clarify
the
issues
if
i
stated
the
outset
that
the
government
in
this
case
does
not
contest
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
to
act
since
it
was
a
federal
search
by
a
federal
officer.
we
think,
mr.
justice
reed,
the
case
of
(inaudible)
which
said
that
you
could
bring
an
action
for
damages
where
you
claim
the
violation
of
a
federal
right
by
a
federal
officer
carries
over
as
to
be
conflict
towards
jurisdictional
purposes,
that
if
there
is
jurisdiction
to
take
an
action
for
damages,
there
was
jurisdiction
to
consider
an
action
for
an
injunction.
what
we
do
say
in
this
case
is
that
the
relief
here
sought
is
neither
authorized
nor
required
by
rule
41
(e)
of
the
rules
of
the
criminal
procedure
because
those
are
rules
for
the
federal
district
court,
and
therefore,
are
limited
in
their
effect
to
the
federal
district
court.
they're
not
a
general
act
of
congress
or
general
constitution,
implemented
on
the
constitutional
requirement
for
all
national
purposes.
but
we
concede
that
a
complaint
in
equity
could
have
been
brought,
and
we're
not
making
an
issue
of
the
fact
that
this
was
done
informally
rather
done
by
a
form
of
complaint
in
equity.
but
whenever
any
equity
question
is
brought
before
a
federal
court,
there
arises
the
problem
not
conceding
the
power
as
a
matter
of
equity
should
the
court
exercise
that
power.
and
in
that
connection,
it
seems
to
me,
one
of
the
general
principles
of
hornbook
law
is
that
a
federal
court
of
equity
exercises
its
power
with
due
regard
to
the
proper
administration
of
state
law.
now,
i
don't
think
that
because
this
is
in
full
an
action
against
the
federal
officer,
one
can
ignore
the
fact
that
it
has
a
very
direct
and
very
serious
impact
and
in
fact
prevent
the
stay
from
prosecuting
for
a
state
crime.
in
the
very
fact
that
in
this
case
the
state
held
up,
pending
--
the
decision
of
this
court
shows
that
what
happened
here
has
a
very
direct
impact
on
state
constitution
for
a
state
crime.
and
i
don't
think
it
can
--
this
case
can
be
disposed
of,
or
that
the
problem
at
the
court
of
equity
should
be
disposed
of
on
the
narrow
ground
that
this
petitioner
came
in
before
the
property
had
even
been
turned
over
to
--
had
been
turned
over
to
the
state,
but
it
couldn't
do
anything
if
the
property
had
been
already
turned
over.
that
does
not
seem
to
us
a
very
desirable
result
in
determining
whether
your
equity
power
to
insist
in
the
sense
upon
array
between
the
two
jurisdiction.
furthermore,
i
want
to
point
out
that
what
the
federal
government
has
already
done,
has
already
had
an
impact
on
the
state
which
it
makes
it
impossible
to
just
say,
“well,
let's
act
as
though
this
search
had
never
occurred.”
the
property
you're
taking
is
contraband,
and
as
such
under
rule
41
(e),
the
court
had
no
authority
to
return
to
petitioner.
now,
that
hadn't
been
returned.
this
is
marihuana.
this
is
a
property
which
the
state
could
have
reached
through
its
own
resources,
through
a
valid
warrant
of
his
own,
presumably
without
relying
at
all
upon
anything
discovered
by
the
federal
government
or
might
have.
but
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
a
federal
officer
made
a
mistake
in
his
warrant,
the
fact
remains
that
this
property
has
been
put
entirely
out
of
the
reach
of
the
state
by
state
process.
and
the
state
gets
it
and
can
get
it
if
at
all,
only
because
the
federal
government
in
the
interest
of
committee
having
its
hands
on
this
property
turns
its
--
is
willing
to
turn
it
over
to
the
state.
just
as
when
the
federal
government
gets
a
prisoner,
and
the
state
wants
--
and
the
federal
government
turns
the
prisoner
over.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
federal
government
has
already
done
something
which
has
already
interfered
with
state
process
and
the
state
prosecution
with
state
crime.
so
that
the
question
comes
down
essentially
to
one
of
general
policy,
how
far
is
the
federal
rule
of
suppression
going
to
be
extended?
the
court
can
extend
it
as
far
as
it
was
asked
here,
but
the
question
is,
should
it?
and
in
that
connection,
we
think
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
problem.
there
is
one,
should
the
court
extend
the
rule
of
suppression
meant
for?
and
the
other
question
is
assuming
that
it
should,
should
it
do
so
now
before
the
state
of
new
mexico,
which
is
in
a
very
real
sense,
the
adverse
party
in
interest
here,
before
the
new
--
state
of
new
mexico
has
had
a
chance
to
pass
on
this
problem
for
it
so
and
before
the
state
can
defend
its
own
decision
before
the
court
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
they
have
not
come
in.
but
i
assume
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
complaint
was
filed
in
the
state
court
that
the
state
had
agreed
to
go
ahead
with
the
prosecution.
it's
in
this
field
that
narcotics
--
particularly
this
is
the
one
area
where
this
is
most
true,
as
i
understand
it.
there
is
a
fairly
close
cooperation
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
it's
an
area
in
which
the
interest
--
there
aren't
as
many
narcotics
agent
as
the
problem
requires
both
state
and
federal
government
have
a
rare
--
very
real
interest
in
suppressing
this
traffic
so
that
cases
are
interchanged
frequently
for
considerations
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
validity
of
search
warrant.
that
is
if
a
person
is
for
some
reason
particularly
important
to
the
local
authority,
the
federal
authority
is
well
--
hand
the
case
over
to
him
and
vice
versa.
so
that
it
seems
to
us,
any
kind
of
a
rule
which
would
depend
on
the
race
as
to
who
gets
there
first
would
not
be
a
desirable
solution
to
this
problem.
we
think,
either
there
ought
to
be
a
rule
that
the
fruits
of
an
invalid
search
are
not
admissible
in
the
state
court,
or
that
--
that
the
federal
courts
will
not
--
will
not
decide
that
matter
at
all,
and
the
state
courts
can
decide
it
for
themselves.
now,
there
is
considerable
variation
among
the
state
courts
and
their
attitude
towards
this
problem.
none
on
the
variation
that
there
is
in
the
weeks
rule
itself
but
even
in
the
state
that
for
themselves
adopts
the
weeks
rule,
some
states
have
said
they
will
not
receive
in
evidence
the
proof
of
an
invalid
search.
and
some
of
them
have
taken
the
federal
approach
and
say
they
will
think
--
they
--
the
state
officers
had
no
part
in
the
invalid
search,
they
feel
free
to
use
the
results
of
a
federal
research.
but
the
point
is,
it
seems
to
us,
that
this
is
a
matter
in
which
the
state
has
a
very
real
interest
to
speak.
and
therefore,
we
think
that
quite
aside
from
the
question
of
what
the
rule
would
be
that
this
ought
to
be
a
rule
which
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
federal
search
ougt
to
be
a
federal
question,
so
to
speak.
and
as
such
as
federal
question,
it
is
a
question
which
can
be
raised
in
the
state
court
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
now,
this
court
in
stefanelli
against
minard,
did
say
that
even
though
a
federal
question
was
involved,
it's
true
that
was
a
state
officer,
but
the
basis
was
a
federal
question.
they
said
the
orderly
processing
is
just
as
the
proper
recognition
of
the
balance
between
the
independence
of
state
government,
requires
that
the
state
pass
on
this
federal
question
first
even
though
in
a
criminal
prosection.
and
therefore,
that
this
matter
can
then
later
be
reviewed
and
although
we
admit
that
there
is
a
different
situation
here
because
there
is
a
federal
officer
involved.
nevertheless,
we
think
that
considering
it
in
relation
to
its
impact
on
the
state
government
that
the
same
law
should
be
applied,
and
that
the
question
ought
to
come
here
framed
in
the
light
of
the
state
determination
of
why
it
--
whether
it
chooses
to
receive
the
evidence,
and
if
it
does
choose
to
receive
it,
why
it
chooses
to
receive
it.
now,
all
--
that
determination
by
the
state
can
make
a
very
real
difference,
it
seems
to
us,
in
the
problem,
with
which
this
court
has
to
deal.
in
the
first
types
of
problem,
they
never
arise.
it
is
true
that
so
far,
the
state
of
mexico
has
refused
to
follow
the
weeks
rule.
but
this
is
an
area
which
is
constantly
in
a
state
of
flak.
just
last
april,
the
supreme
court
of
california,
overruling
a
long
line
of
decisions,
has
decided
that
for
that
state
and
on
it's
own,
it
would
adopt
the
rule
of
suppression.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
but
i
have
also
not
found
any
recent
new
mexico
decision
on
the
question
of
suppression.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
nevertheless,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
the
light
of
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
question,
in
the
light
of
the
california
example,
a
state
of
new
mexico
ought
at
least
to
have
the
opportunity
to
pass
for
itself
on
the
question
of
whether
it
wants
to
go
with
what
is
in
newer
trend.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
there
--
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
i
process
my
remarks
by
saying
that
it
would
appear
to
us
desirable
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
rule,
a
federal
rule
which
reaches
over
so
for
as
to
have
the
real
practical
impact
on
state
prosecution
that's
here
involved.
it
would
seem
to
us
desirable
that
such
a
rule
be
a
rule
that
flows
from
the
back
of
an
illegal
search
rather
than
from
the
circumstance
of
what
the
court
should
got
to
first.
now,
if
this
flows
from
the
fact
of
an
illegal
federal
search,
it
would
still
seem
to
me,
that
the
state
court
would
have
--
did
not
accept
the
evidence.
the
--
the
basis
for
asking
equity
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court,
now,
it
seems
to
me,
would
be
something
like
this,
“we
recognize
that
the
state
of
new
mexico
can
take
this
evidence,
and
that
in
taking
this
evidence,
there
is
no
federal
question
under
either
the
fourth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
therefore,
we
have
to
act
--
the
federal
court
has
to
act
now
just
to
make
sure
that
the
state
never
gets
hold
of
that.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
--
i
think
is
the
question
of
policy,
your
honor.
but
as
against
that,
i
think
one
does
have
to
consider
that
you're
not
just
presenting
the
federal
law
of
a
different
going
across
the
street.
because,
as
i
started
saying
in
the
beginning,
to
the
extent
that
the
federal
government
has
taken
his
property,
out
of
the
reach
of
a
valid
process
by
the
state,
by
it's
own
officers,
if
the
federal
government
hadn't
interfered
at
this
point,
a
state
officer
might
well
with
his
federal
warrant,
have
been
able
to
prosecute
what
may
well
be
a
major
state
offense
or
i
don't
know.
but
one
thing
is
the
fact
is
that
the
federal
government,
through
a
federal
government's
officer
and
state,
has
had
the
effect
of
seriously
already
interfering
with
state
persecutions.
and
so,
we
come
to
this
question
of
the
balance
of
interest.
there's
no
doubt
about
power
but
you
do
have
the
effect
that
although
it
is
informed
against
the
federal
officer,
it's
not
against
the
federal
officer
acting
as
a
federal
officer
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
this
was
a
joint
enterprise
in
which
it
so
happens
that
the
federal
officer
made
the
search.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
no,
i'm
saying
it
may
have
been
a
case
that
was
developed
together,
but
in
which
the
federal
officer
got
the
warrant
first,
i
don't
know
this.
but
i
don't
think
the
rule
can
depend
upon
so
narrow
a
question
as
to
whether
in
this
case,
the
federal
government
started
first
that
--
that
whether
a
state
can
prosecute
for
a
state
crime
should
depend
on
the
fact
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
decision
was
made
to
prosecute
first
in
the
federal
courts.
whereas,
it's
in
exactly
the
same
case
for
some
reason,
the
property
had
been
turned
over
to
the
state
first
and
the
indictment
had
first
been
brought
into
the
state
court
even
though
obtained
under
the
same
warrant
that
you
could
have
gone
ahead
with
the
state
prosecution.
maybe
--
it
seems
to
me,
a
result
which
the
court
would
not
want
to
reach
on
that
narrow
ground
unless
compelled
to
do
so.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
suggest
also
that
there's
another
fact
to
be
considered
in
this
case,
and
that
is
this
question
of
the
invalidity
of
this
particular
search.
as
i
read
the
record,
the
warrant
--
the
affidavit
isn't
there
but
it
seems
evident
from
the
order
that
is
in
the
record.
the
basis
for
the
suppression
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
this
warrant
was
obtained
on
information
and
belief
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
the
affidavit
of
the
actual
informant
who
had
knowledge
of
that
fact.
now,
it's
true
we're
in
no
position
to
contest
the
fact
before
the
federal
court
that's
been
held
to
be
an
invalid
warrant,
an
insufficient
warrant,
and
the
evidence
has
been
declared.
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
follow
with
such
decency
that
even
though
--
that
we
--
or
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
kind
of
an
error
or
the
kind
of
a
search
which
is
not
openly
and
unquestionably
illegal
present
a
state
from
going
ahead
just
because
this
warrant
is
not
sufficient
in
the
federal
law.
there
are
states,
i
found
new
mexico
--
known
new
mexico
decision,
but
there
are
states
which
consider
decisions
and
affidavits
on
information
and
belief
it's
the
grounds
for
the
information
and
belief
were
given.
oh,
it
seems
again
to
us
that
this
is
a
decision
first
for
new
mexico
to
make.
that
if
new
mexico
decides
that
for
its
purposes,
this
is
not
an
unreasonable
search,
then
the
fact
of
the
federal
officer
got
the
evidence
worth
ought
not
to
preclude
the
state
of
new
mexico
from
going
ahead
with
a
prosecution
for
a
state
offense
to
the
sense
--
federal
officer
got
there
first,
that's
a
fact,
but
very
often,
instead
of
cooperation
sometimes
there's
conflict,
there
are
question
sometimes.
federal
officer
gets
a
prisoner
first,
the
state
warrants
him.
these
things
have
to
be
worked
out
as
the
matter
of
comity.
and
i
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
the
state
ought
to
be
prevented
from
going
ahead
unless
this
court
is
willing
to
go
much
further
and
say
that
when
there
is
an
invalid
search
warrant,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter
for
all
purposes.
that
means
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
as
a
matter
of
federal
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
we
don't
think
this
evidence
ought
to
be
available
in
the
state
court,
whatever
the
rule
is
about
state
officers.
now,
it
--
it
seems
to
us
the
rule
has
to
be
in
a
sense
either
as
general
as
that
and
not
be
based
on
the
particular
circumstances
that
developed
in
a
particular
case.
now,
as
to
any
such
general
policy
that
would
be,
i
think
admittedly
an
extension
far
beyond
the
requirement
of
this
--
that
so
far
have
been
attached
the
rule
of
suppression.
this
court
in
the
wolf,
in
the
irvine
case,
i
think
talks
about
the
rule
of
suppression
as
they
--
subsidiary
evidentiary
and
procedural
doctrine
developed
by
the
federal
court.
i
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
wolf
against
colorado
on
had
made
clear
that
the
rule
of
suppression
is
not
inherent
in
the
fourth
amendment
and
not
an
inescapable
consequence
of
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
we
concede
and
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
it
had
the
power
--
equity
power.
it
had
jurisdiction
as
a
court
of
equity.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
right
and
i'm
saying
that
we
don't
think
it
is
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
the
other
side
is
arguing,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
this
is
required
by
rule
41.
we
think
it
clearly
is
not,
that
rule
41
is
a
rule
for
the
federal
district
court
that
when
say
evidence
shall
not
be
required
in
any
hearing
or
trial
that
that
mean
--
that
shall
not
be
in
any
federal
hearing
or
trial.
and
we
think
that
the
whole
--
well,
the
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
which
have
said
that
the
rule
of
suppression
is
of
one
method
of
enforcing
fourth
amendment
right,
not
the
complete
method,
not
the
only
method
of
enforcing
fourth
amendment
right,
indicates
that
this
is
a
rule
of
policy
for
the
federal
court.
and
as
such,
we
don't
think
it
should
go
so
far
as
to
extend
over
into
the
state
court
so
as
to
preclude
the
states
from
getting
evidence
which
is
evidence
of
a
state
court
and
which,
say
for
the
mistake
of
the
federal
officer,
the
state
might
well
have
been
able
to
get
through
its
own
valid
process.
now,
i
want
to
make
only
one
other
point
and
that
is
that
if
this
--
if
the
court
was
going
to
lay
down
a
general
rule
of
evidence
the
power
of
--
from
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment
right,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
--
that
the
state
court
would
be
bound
as
a
matter
of
federal
--
of
the
--
of
the
constitution
to
exclude
that
evidence.
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
like
douglas
against
the
city
of
jeannette
and
stefanelli
against
minard,
there'd
be
no
occasion
for
the
act
--
court
to
act
now
in
advance
action
by
the
state.
so
that
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
general
rule,
this
action
is
premature
because
the
state
ought
to
act
on
it
first.
the
basis
for
action
now
would
be
the
particular
circumstances
here
realizing
that
if
the
state
got
the
evidence,
they'd
be
absolutely
free
to
use
it
and
no
federal
question
would
be
read.
well,
that
seems
to
us
an
undesirable
rule
which
would
make
suppression
depend
or
make
a
general
rule
of
admissibility
in
state
courts
depend
on
the
particular
race
of
who
got
where
first.
and
that
does
not
seem
to
us
a
--
a
proper
method
of
dealing
with
this
really
quite
significant
question
in
federal
state
relationships.
