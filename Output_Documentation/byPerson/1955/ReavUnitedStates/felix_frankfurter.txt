justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
case
versed
entirely
on
the
constitutional
grounds?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
do
you
begin
with
that?
why
do
you
begin
with
the
constitutional
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
how
it
would
be
fair
to
say,
you
don't
begin
with
the
constitutional
point,
you
end
with
it.
however,
that's
your
argument
and
department.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
always
wanted
a
decision
on
the
broadest
possible
point.
perhaps,
i
agree
strongly
about
that
because
when
i
was
young,
i
tried
to
--
just
ought
to
do
that,
the
courts
to
do
that
and
is
also
is
not
our
loss
in
the
case
entirely.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
your
restriction,
restrict
--
the
restriction
you
desire
upon
his
testimonial
appearance
in
the
state
court
is
merely
a
restriction
as
to
the
content
for
the
evidence
of
--
pertaining
to
evidence
which
the
federal
court
had
already
suppressed
and
said
could
not
be
used
in
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
testify
about
everything
else
under
the
sun
to
take
court
and
permit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
asking
anything
up
here
of
the
state
court?
you're
not
asking
for
an
application
of
this
in
the
state
court?
you're
asking
for
some
action
by
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
isn't
application
over
the
weeks
doctrine
to
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
do
we
have
to
talk
about
an
application
of?
i
don't
know
what
that
word
means.
you're
not
--
if
you
say
you
do
not
--
you
rest
this
on
the
power
of
the
federal
court
not
to
allow
an
official
of
the
federal
government
whose
conduct
has
already
been
declared
illegal
to
disregard
that
determination
of
illegality
in
the
federal
court,
the
federal
action
that
he
shouldn't
in
the
broader
kind
of
a
way
beat
the
devil
around
the
stump
by
testifying
in
the
state
court.
this
isn't
an
injunction
that
binds
with
the
state
court.
this
is
an
injunction
that
binds
the
individual.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
state
court
hasn't
got
a
thing
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
consequence
may
be
that
the
state
court
wouldn't
get
certain
evidence
which
is
otherwise
would
get,
this
is
action
by
the
federal
court
in
regard
to
federal
officials
about
something
that
the
federal
court
had
already
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
no
more
including
into
the
state
process
that
if
a
federal
court
seizes
property
which
the
state
court
there
--
after
which
the
state
court
thereafter
seeks
to
adjudicate
and
the
state
court
there
would
be
including
in
the
federal
process
considered
by
a
reversal.
that's
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
been
--
consist
a
different
case
or
rather
you
would
have
a
different
case
if
the
federal
agent
had
turned
the
physical
--
possibly
that
the
physical
thing
in
--
in
dealing,
the
reading
over
to
a
state
officer
and
you
were
to
try
to
enjoin
the
state
officer
from
using
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
very
different
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
haven't
got
that
case
here,
have
we?
we
haven't
had
a
case
of
contempt
or
an
attachment
for
contempt
against
an
officer
who
had
turned
over
the
guilty
thing
before
you
move
against
him.
we
haven't
got
that
case,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
haven't
got
--
we
haven't
got
any
--
you
haven't
got
a
case
of
either
the
officer
having
turned
over
the
evidence,
the
real
evidence
so-called,
or
how
he
testified
and
being
hailed
for
contempt.
we
haven't
got
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
haven't
even
got
the
case
of
an
agent
with
knowledge
that
you
were
about
to
go
into
federal
court
concerning
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
having
--
actually
turned
it
over.
we
haven't
got
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
i'm
saying
we
haven't
got
a
case
where
with
knowledge
that
you
are
about
to
move
to
enjoin
the
turning
over,
he
turned
it
over.
we
haven't
got
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
we
got
a
very
simple
case
of
--
of
the
suppression
order
by
the
federal
authority
and
an
endeavor
on
your
part
if
you
could
give
it
to
effectuate
that
for
not
having
gone
across
the
street
with
the
justice
of
the
peace,
that's
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
state
--
the
state
couldn't
get
hold
of
the
property
except
to
get
out
of
the
--
it
should
never
have
been
seized
the
way
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
merely
another
way
of
saying,
can
a
federal
official
violate
the
constitutional
provision
as
this
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
there
irreparable
on
the
assumption
that
--
the
assumption
that
other
arguments
are
irrelevant,
why
didn't
irreparable
harm
not
to
have
new
evidence
which
may
well
be
faith
of
the
prosecution,
faith
against
the
favor
or
prosecution.
if
that
evidence
should
be
used,
why
is
it
not
irreparable
harm?
you
can't
put
it
in
dollars
in
a
sense
but
you
can
put
it
in
the
irreparability.
why
isn't
irreparable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
since
i
--
(inaudible)
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
it's
an
exception
to
the
rule
requiring
for
equitable
action
of
the
--
to
show
the
irreparable
harm
would
be
the
clear
--
clearest
kind
of
an
object,
irreparable
harm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
whether
irreparable
harm
means
a
vast
amount
of
money
or
the
destruction
of
the
picture
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
that
they're
irreparable
harm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
the
introduction
of
that
(inaudible)
in
jail,
but
which
shouldn't
have
be
allowed
to
be
introduced
seems
to
be
a
fair
case
of
irreparable
harm.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
then
(inaudible)
of
new
mexico
come
in
either
below
or
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
first
that
state
of
new
mexico
may
have
the
benefit
of
the
result
of
this
proposed
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
found
any
other
state
of
the
senate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
california
has
been
--
had
a
very
sharply
divided
point
on
that
subject.
that
state
is
selfless,
merely
in
the
state
of
flak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
i
know,
that's
not
true
of
any
other
state
that
rejected
the
weeks
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
very
different
problem,
ms.
rosenberg.
because
for
myself,
it
--
if
new
mexico
doesn't
want
to
go
to
with
what
you
call
the
new
trend,
i
see
no
sign
of
it,
except
california,
it
was
a
dubious
sign
because
as
i've
said
that
court
has
divided
--
divided
within
itself,
if
california
--
new
mexico
wants
to
adhere
to
it
doctrine
but
myself
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
bar
it.
that's
a
different
question
whether
california
--
whether
new
mexico
having
appeared
through
its
rule
of
evidence,
have
admitting
illegally
and
from
its
point
of
view,
it
wouldn't
be
illegal,
illegally
procured
evidence,
conviction
should
stand,
there's
a
very
different
question
from
what
the
federal
government
should
do
about
a
situation
which
can
serve
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
ground.
the
ground
with
judicial
self-respect
that
this
federal
court
having
found
that
the
constitutional
invalidity
in
the
action
of
one
of
it's
--
of
an
officer
of
the
united
states
ought
not
to
sit
idly
by,
in
due
time,
that
if
asked
to
present
that
official
goal
across
the
street
and
accomplish
the
same
results
which
should
have
just
the
(inaudible)
constitutional
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
ms.
rosenberg,
we
--
we
in
such
has
ought
to
be
--
to
know
few
things
and
such
can
have
ordinary
simple
knowledge,
and
we
know
that
in
these
cases,
officially
narcotics
issues,
the
federal
officials
and
the
state
officials
are
in
close
with
contradict
and
intimate
collaboration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
a
determination
here
to
the
start
this
proceeding
in
the
federal
court
and
not
in
the
state
court.
i
don't
have
to
have
that
as
a
matter
of
record.
i
know
enough
about
that
and
everybody
else
seems
to
follow
and
this
prosecution
knows
that.
but
there
is
this
constant
collaboration
being
assumed
and
this
was
decided
that
the
federal
official
should
bring
this
proceeding
in
the
federal
court,
and
it
was
brought
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
you
didn't
say,
“well,
what
of
it
if
you
go
now
and
go
across
the
street,
you
look
at
it
there
because
under
new
mexico
law,
we
have
the
benefit
of
that
which
the
federal
court
can
allow
us.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
rosenberg,
this
--
this
case
and
what
was
done
here
must
be
said
in
the
context
of
past
history,
and
the
records
of
this
court
show
that
what
used
to
be
done
is
to
have
the
federal
officials
get
the
state
officials
to
make
the
--
the
unreasonable
search
and
seizure,
and
that
then
they
could
come
into
the
court
indeed
as
they
did
until
this
court
stopped
them
and
said,
“oh,
we
haven't
done
anything
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
it's
the
state
officials
that
have
done
it
and
therefore
we
have
a
right
to
use
this
evidence
which
the
state
officials
have
produced.“
and
this
court
put
an
end
to
that
practice
and
it's
high
ground
we
put
an
end
to
this
practice
in
having
the
federal
officials
trying
to
do
what
they
can.
if
they
don't
succeed
in
the
federal
court,
send
it
all
to
the
state
courts.
