mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
in
august
of
1953
when
a
federal
narcotics
agent
searched
the
home
of
the
petitioner
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico
and
seized
from
his
home
what
was
claimed
to
be
narcotics
and
other
pieces
of
property
such
as
tobacco
cans
and
a
couple
of
pipes.
the
search
and
seizure
were
conducted
under
the
authority
of
a
federal
search
warrant
which
had
been
issued
by
the
united
states
commissioner
of
the
court
in
albuquerque,
the
federal
court.
after
he
had
his
home
searched,
a
federal
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment
for
the
possession
of
marihuana
without
having
paid
the
necessary
tax
thereon.
nine
months
later,
be
--
as
the
case
was
coming
up
to
trial,
the
petitioner
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence.
he
did
not
move
for
a
return
of
any
of
the
evidence,
including
that
which
was
not
claimed
to
be
contraband.
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
the
federal
government
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
it
was
dismissed.
thereafter,
the
federal
narcotics
agent
went
to
the
state
official
as
a
state
justice
of
the
peace
and
swore
out
a
warrant
under
new
mexico
law
for
the
illegal
possession
of
marihuana.
it's
stipulated
that
he
used
the
information
he
had
obtained
through
the
federal
search
warrant
to
the
execution
of
the
federal
search
warrant.
it's
also
stipulated,
and
stipulated
at
the
hearing,
that
he
intends
to
turn
over
to
the
state
government
for
the
state
prosecution
the
evidence
which
was
illegally
seized
and
which
is
now
in
custody
of
the
federal
government
having
been
taken
under
this
illegal
search
warrant.
at
this
point,
the
petitioner
then
went
back
in
the
federal
court
and
moved
for
an
order
to
--
to
be
served
upon
the
federal
narcotics
agent
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt
for
having
violated
the
federal
court's
order
suppressing
the
evidence.
and
it
further
moved
that
he
be
enjoined
and
any
federal
officials
having
federal
custody
of
that
which
was
seized
from
presenting
it
in
state
court.
now,
at
the
present
time,
the
state
prosecution
is
pending
and
it
--
it's
at
this
juncture
of
the
case
that
the
petitioner
is
seeking
to
have
these
federal
officials
enjoined
from
using
the
evidence
and
the
knowledge
which
they
obtained
during
the
execution
of
this
illegal
search
warrant.
under
the
fourth
amendment,
the
issues
which
are
raised
in
the
view
of
the
petitioner
are,
first,
whether
or
not
the
fourth
amendment
demands
as
a
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
at
the
remedy
of
suppression
be
given
where
the
federal
government
has
illegally
seized
something
pursuant
to
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
not
entirely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
begin
with
this,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
strongest
point.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
very
well,
your
honor.
in
addition
--
still
under
the
question
of
the
fourth
amendment.
if
this
remedy
is
one
which
the
amendment
itself
demands,
the
remedy
of
suppression
and
in
return
of
goods,
in
case
here
there's
no
contraband
involved,
then
the
question
is,
is
this
binding
on
the
state
courts
as
courts
of
--
courts
which
are
subject
to
the
constitution?
and
finally,
if
it
is
binding
and
they
could
not
receive
it,
should
the
federal
government
--
the
federal
courts
under
these
circumstances
enjoin
federal
officials
from
presenting
this
evidence
in
a
state
court.
that
would
be
the
constitutional
issue
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
petitioner
does
not
rest
entirely
upon
the
--
the
fourth
amendment.
in
addition,
it
his
contention
that
this
constituted
an
abuse
of
the
federal
court's
process,
it
was
carried
out
by
federal
officers
acting
pursuant
to
illegal
process
and
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
court,
the
federal
court,
apart
from
the
constitution,
to
prevent
an
abuse
of
its
process
and
to
restore
the
status
quo.
taking
the
argument
up
in
the
--
in
the
inverse
order,
i
shall
begin
with
the
inverse
order
which
i've
just
mentioned.
i
shall
begin
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
--
whether
or
not
the
federal
government
--
the
federal
courts
should
have
just
as
a
matter
of
preventing
the
abuse
of
its
own
process,
have
ordered
these
federal
officers
not
to
testify
and
also
order
the
--
the
evidence
which
they
seized,
not
turned
over
to
the
state
official.
as
i've
indicated
a
moment
ago,
in
this
case,
the
action
was
initiated
by
a
warrant
which
issued
out
of
the
federal
court
in
new
mexico.
it
began
with
an
error
in
the
federal
court.
the
united
states
commissioner,
who
is
an
officer
of
the
federal
court,
improperly
and
contrary
to
the
constitution
issued
the
warrant
in
question.
it
was
executed
and
it
was
processed
of
the
court
which
was
being
executed,
just
as
a
marshal
would
execute
process
for
an
attachment.
this
was
being
done
in
a
--
in
a
criminal
case.
and
this
court
has
held
in
wise
versus
henkel,
when
the
case
came
before
it,
that
the
court
has
the
authority
to
consider
and
decide
applications
for
returns
of
things
which
are
illegally
seized,
wholly
apart
from
the
constitutional
issue.
in
wise
versus
henkel,
the
trial
court,
after
there
had
been
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
pursuant
to
federal
process,
ordered
that
the
united
states
attorney
return
the
property
which
was
seized.
the
united
states
attorney
refused
to
do
so
and
he
was
held
in
contempt.
he
attempted
to
appeal
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
federal
constitutional
question
involved.
and
this
court
held
that
the
application
for
a
return
did
not
raise
a
constitutional
question,
and
therefore,
they
denied
his
appeal.
and
in
connection
with
that,
they
said,
the
authority
of
the
court
to
consider
and
decide
the
application
for
the
return
of
the
books
and
papers
existed
wholly
irrespective
of
whether
there
was
a
constitutional
right
to
exact
the
returns
of
the
books
and
papers.
that
is
to
say,
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
of
the
return
and
pass
upon
it.
and
as
a
result
of
its
inherent
authority
to
consider
and
decide
questions
arising
before
it,
concerning
an
alleged
unreasonable
exertion
of
the
process
of
the
court,
that
is
the
power
which
i
suggest
to
the
court
would
enable
and
should
have
caused
the
federal
district
court
in
new
mexico
to
undo
what
had
been
done
pursuant
to
its
illegal
process,
i
should
say
an
abuse
of
its
process.
and
it
had
that
inherent
authority
and
right
to
do
so
apart
from
the
constitutional
issue.
this
is
very
similar
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
that
the
court,
any
court
has
a
power
as
a
court.
it
inheres
in
its
power
as
a
court
to
control
its
own
process,
including
undoing
any
abuse
of
its
own
process.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
do
not
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
congress
has
not
specifically
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
--
given
this
power
and
in
the
absence
of
giving
it
as
a
court
in
able
to
--
in
order
to
--
to
be
able
to
conduct
its
function
as
a
court.
it's
necessary
that
a
--
it
be
able
to
control
its
own
process.
as
for
example,
if
it
authorized
an
illegal
attachment
and
the
person
who
was
a
victim
of
the
illegal
attachment
would
certainly
come
in
the
court
and
could
come
in
the
court,
and
ask
that
the
attachment
be
dissolved
because
it
was
illegally
done
in
the
first
place
and
this
is
comparable
to
that.
now,
certainly
in
this
case,
if
--
after
the
warrant,
the
illegal
warrant
had
been
obtained
by
the
federal
officer
and
before
it
had
been
possible
to
search
the
petitioner's
home,
the
petitioner
had
been
able
to
get
in
the
federal
court
and
get
into
the
--
to
the
federal
judge.
he
could
have
moved
to
quash
the
warrant
and
it
would
have
been
quashed
as
it
was
quashed
after
the
illegal
act
was
done.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
there
was
not
sufficient
time,
they
did
not
succeed
in
running
to
the
federal
court
house
before
the
federal
officer
had
succeeded
in
executing
the
process,
should
not
prejudice
him.
he
should
be
in
exactly
the
same
position,
as
if
he
had
been
able
to
get
in
the
federal
court
at
the
time
the
process
were
issued,
but
before
it
was
executed.
and
the
court
should,
under
those
circumstances,
should
have
undone
what
was
done
and
of
course
the
only
way
in
which
it
could
undo
what
has
been
illegally
done
was
to
suppress
and
treat
the
evidence
as
if
it
did
not
exist,
and
as
if
the
federal
government
did
not
have
the
knowledge
which
it
should
not
have
had.
in
other
words,
it
should
restore
the
status
quo
which
was
disturbed
by
the
court's,
having
issued
in
the
first
place,
its
illegal
process.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor.
we
simply
ask
to
have
it
suppressed
and
not
returned.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
the
property
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
the
record
shows
that
it
was
claimed
to
be
marihuana
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
--
and
i
believe
two
tobacco
cans
and
two
pipes.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
we
simply
asked
that
it
be
suppressed.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
and
--
and
the
search
warrant
quashed
which
was
done.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
we
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
that
is
not,
your
honor.
after
that
had
been
done,
after
the
court
had
suppressed
the
evidence
and
the
federal
officer
then
went
to
state
officials,
we
came
back
in
the
court
and
again
asked
that
--
we
asked
that
he
be
held
in
contempt
or
rather
that
an
order
be
issued
to
show
why
he
should
not
be
held
in
contempt.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
and
we
also
asked
that
he
be
enjoined
in
the
--
and
federal
officials
having
federal
custody
of
this
--
of
the
illegally
seized
property
that
they
be
enjoined
from
transferring
it
out
of
the
custody
of
the
federal
government.
that
was
on
a
second
motion
after
there
had
been
an
original
suppression.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
that
is
on
page
5
of
the
record,
your
honor.
it's
entitled
a
motion
for
an
order
to
show
cause
and
other
relief
that
continues
over
to
page
7.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
would
not
say
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
it
was
--
broadly
speaking,
it's
discretionary
but
we
contend
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
have
done
it
in
this
case.
the
power
itself
can
be
turned
discretionary,
but
it's
our
claim
that
--
in
this
particular
case,
he
abused
his
discretion
in
not
granting
the
relief
asked
for.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
well,
i
think
the
word
suppression,
your
honor,
includes
suppressing
all
knowledge
and
effectively
that
means
stopping
somebody
from
testifying,
same
as
it
would
if
it
were
in
federal
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
that
is
part
of
our
relief,
your
honor.
the
other
portion
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
the
other
portion
of
our
relief
is
even
if
they
can
testify
that
they
cannot
turnover
physically
the
evidence
that
was
seized
in
addition
of
testifying.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
it
might
be
of
some
use
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
--
it
would
be
--
wouldn't
be
for
relief,
your
honor,
in
our
view.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
precisely,
your
honor.
we
treat
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
the
type
of
evidence,
the
testimonial
evidence
i'm
speaking
of
would
be
comparable
to
photostatic
copies,
for
example,
if
papers
that
had
been
illegally
seized.
in
a
case
of
suppression,
in
the
federal
court,
at
least,
where
the
evidence
has
been
suppressed,
the
federal
agents
cannot
produce
photostatic
copies
of
paper
that
they
seized
and
turn
back
nor
can
they
testify
about
the
contents
of
those
because
that's
included
in
the
word
suppression.and
that
is
a
relief
which
we
seek
so
far
as
state
court
is
concerned.
it's
a
relief
which
is
identical
in
a
state
court
with
that
which
would
be
given
and
was
given
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
well,
i
think
it's
probably
included
in
facts
about
the
supposed
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
anything
that
he
learned
as
a
result
of
his
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
i
should
say
an
application
of
the
weeks'
rule
in
a
state
court.
it
has
never
been
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
would
say
an
application
of
the
weeks
rule,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
the
weeks
rule
contained
in
it
a
limitation
that
--
that
it
necessary
defy
the
federal
courts.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor,
entirely.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
there's
an
application
of
the
weeks
doctrine
to
federal
officials
as
it
--
as
it
would
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
precisely.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
none
whatever
--
none
whatever.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
that's
--
that
states
my
point
precisely.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
if
he
were
summoned
by
the
state
court,
the
federal
official
who
had
been
ordered,
suppose
he
were
given
a
--
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
and
also
ordered
to
testify
about
this
matter
which
he
had
been
enjoined.
i
would
say
he
would
be
obliged
not
to
testify
and
if
the
state
court
held
him
in
contempt,
his
relief
would
be
to
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
the
federal
court
in
vindication
of
the
federal
right
which
was
involved.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
it
prevents
the
state
court's
process
from
reaching
into
--
into
federal
courts,
your
honor.
the
same
as
--
the
same
as
a
situation
where
the
federal
court
has
attached
in
pursuance
of
a
federal
case,
certain
property
and
we've
had
exactly
that
case
in
(inaudible),
i
think
it
was,
where
once
the
state
--
the
--
the
federal
court
had
custody,
it
was
in
custody
of
law,
so
to
speak,
at
that
time
a
state
court
tried
to
reach
it
as
they
would
try
--
be
trying
to
do
in
this
case.
and
it
was
held
that
the
federal
right
and
the
right
of
the
federal
court
to
maintain
its
custody
of
what
is
already
taken
was
paramount
in
such
a
situation
and
could
not
be
reached.
i
would
say
its
more
an
attempt
if
the
state
court
should
do
it,
by
the
state
court
to
enter
--
interfere
with
the
federal
court's
process
and
with
--
with
what
was
obtained
as
a
result
of
its
action,
its
more
of
an
interference
by
them
than
it
is
a
reverse
because
we're
not
touching
any
state
official
or
state
court.
the
practical
result
is
they
simply
cannot
reach
something
which
the
federal
government
has
which
it
never
should
have
had.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
i
said
--
this,
the
argument
i
am
now
advancing
is
--
is
apart
from
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
weeks
doctrine,
the
constitutional
doctrine.
and
assuming
for
the
moment
that
if
the
state
through
some
means
or
another
actually
got
possession
of
the
physical
property
that's
here
involved,
assuming
that
it
might,
under
the
constitution
use
it,
i
still
say
that
this
federal
court
has
an
obligation
not
to
make
it
available
to
it.
it
would
be
comparable
to
a
situation
where
an
f.b.i.
man
is
subpoenaed
in
the
state
court
in
order
to
produce
certain
confidential
documents,
of
course,
he
would
refuse.
and
even
though
it
might
be
true
that
if
the
information
contained
therein
got
in
the
state
court,
the
state
court
might
use
the
information,
still
the
federal
government
and
its
federal
agents
have
an
obligation
in
the
first
place
not
to
make
it
available
and
it's
simply
the
enforcement
of
this
obligation
which
we
are
here
seeking.
that
same
situation
arose
in
boske
versus
comingore
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
where
the
internal
revenue
officer
had
certain
regulations,
which
of
course
were
passed
pursuant
to
law.
he
was
not
to
turn
over
to
anyone
else
certain
confidential
documents.
the
state
of
kentucky
in
a
civil
case
desired
to
get
the
returns
which
had
been
made
by
the
man
against
whom
they
were
bringing
a
civil
case.
so
they
ordered
and
they
subpoenaed
the
federal
official,
the
internal
revenue
official
to
come
in
and
bring
those
documents.
he
refused
to
do
so
and
they
held
him
in
contempt
and
that
he
was
freed
on
a
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
on
the
basis,
they
had
no
obligation.
now,
it
might
be
true
in
that
case
that
the
state
of
kentucky
had
succeeded
in
getting
these
papers
that
had
been
submitted
by
their
defendant,
that
they
could
have
used
him
and
obtained
the
judgment
against
him
on
the
basis
of
it.
nevertheless,
in
such
a
situation,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
federal
government
had
an
obligation
not
to
turn
it
over
and
the
federal
agent
had
the
same
obligation.
and
in
that
situation,
if
--
if
the
federal
agent
were
threatening
to
turn
over
something
which
he
had
in
his
possession
which
the
law
said
he
could
not
turn
over,
i'm
sure
the
federal
court
would
enjoin
him
from
doing
it.
the
same
as
it
would
enjoin
an
f.b.i.
man
from
turning
over
his
confidential
reports
to
a
state
contrary
to
his
regulations
in
the
law.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
would
not
say
that
it
would
not,
your
honor.
in
such
a
situation,
of
course,
he's
not
executing
the
illegal
warrant
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
our
action
only
goes
to
that.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor,
because
we
haven't
sought
that
remedy.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
that's
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
he
was,
your
honor.
he
instituted
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
he
went
before
justice
of
the
peace
and
he
swore
out
a
warrant
and
in
the
warrant,
of
course,
he
put
the
information
which
--
which
he
had
obtained.
now,
that
was
all
that
was
done,
the
warrant
was
issued,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
and
the
case
is
that
--
at
that
posture
now.
there's
been
no
process
issued
out
of
state
court
and
the
case
is
simply
pending.
nothing
further
has
been
done.
he
initiated
the
process
though.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
technically,
of
course,
the
federal
government
would
not
be
the
prosecutor
but
if
the
federal
government
is
the
one
that
--
the
one
with
a
supply
--
that
is
supplying
the
means
and
the
only
means
by
which
the
case
can
be
prosecuted
and
then
it's
the
one
that
initiated
the
prosecution.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
am
simply
in
--
i
think
the
question
was
asked
but
i'm
anticipating
that
it's
possible
to
state
a
will.
and
i
believe
the
question
was
asked
specifically,
what
would
happen
if
the
state
did
subpoena
him,
is
that
not
an
interference
with
their
process?
it
has
not
been
done
but
conceivably
it
could
be
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
although,
it
has
not
been
taken.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
very
different.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
would
we
ask?
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
if
he
had
done
so,
your
honor,
i
think
he
could
be
if
he
did
it
knowingly
and
contemptuously.
there
would
have
to
be
a
show
cause
order
and
he
might
say
that
i
was
advised
by
the
united
states
attorney
it
was
all
right.
but
if
he
did
it
deliberately
in
defiance
to
the
court,
of
course,
i
think
he
could
be
held
in
contempt
because
he
violated
the
suppression.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
that
would
be
true.
after
we
had
the
injunction
against
him
then
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
we
are
and
part
of
our
relief
here
is
seeking
to
have
him
--
rather
to
have
a
show
cause
order
why
he
should
not
be
at
this
time
because
the
evidence
was
suppressed
at
the
time
he
went
and
testified
about
in
the
state.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
well
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
not
specifically,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
not
turning
over
any
physical
evidence?
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
that
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
well,
that
--
that
i
think
we
do
have,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
believe,
we
do
have
that
and
that's
why
we
asked
for
an
order
to
show
cause.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no.
not
the
actual
--
turned
it
over.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
not
that
one.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
we
have
to
pass
here.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
coming
to
the
constitutional
argument
immediately.
in
addition
to
the
--
what
i
said
as
the
inherent
part
and
the
obligation
of
the
court
to
control
the
abuse
of
its
own
process
and
to
place
parties
in
status
quo.
in
addition
to
that,
i
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
the
federal
government
in
this
case
grant
the
relief
which
is
asked
for
by
the
petitioner.
first
of
all,
i
said
that
in
the
view
of
the
petitioner,
the
fourth
amendment
includes
the
remedy
of
suppression
and
of
course
in
case
that
there's
a
return
at
bar
if
it's
not
contraband
then
it
return
also.
the
weeks
doctrine
which
was
the
--
i've
been
preceded
only
by
the
boyd
case,
was
broadly
stated
as
the
protection
of
the
fourth
--
that
if
the
fruit
could
be
used
against
someone
who
was
a
victim
of
one
of
these
searches
by
the
federal
government,
then
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
declaring
his
right
to
be
secure
against
such
searches
and
seizure
is
of
no
value.
and
so
far
as
those
vast
place
are
concerned,
it
might
as
well
be
stricken
from
the
constitution.
now,
that
statement
which
was
made
in
reference
to
a
--
the
use
of
the
evidence
in
federal
court
certainly
is
applicable
to
state
court
because
as
far
as
this
victim
is
concerned,
if
the
federal
government
is
free
to
search
his
home
without
a
proper
warrant
and
then
give
it
to
the
state,
and
have
him
prosecuted,
as
far
as
he
is
concerned,
the
constitution
in
that
given
case
and
that
is
this
particular
case
is
of
no
value.
it
doesn't
help
him
when
i
held
it
in
a
state
court
and
he
has
been
the
victim
of
the
federal
government's
action.
now,
the
weeks
case,
of
course,
dealt
specifically
with
a
federal
--
it
was
a
federal
prosecution.
but
the
principle
involved
that
a
victim
ought
to
be
place
in
status
quo
and
he
ought
not
to
be
in
a
worse
situation
by
reason
of
the
action
of
the
federal
government,
that
principle
is
applicable
when
there
is
a
state
prosecution
as
well
as
when
there's
a
federal
prosecution.
the
rationale
is
of
course
put
the
party
where
you
found
them
before
you
violated
his
rights.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
just
put
him
where
you
found
him
so
far
as
a
federal
prosecution
is
concerned,
it
means
put
him
where
you
found
him
and
so
far
as
liability
for
damage
is
concerned,
and
to
illustrate
that
there
is
the
boyd
case.
in
the
boyd
case
which
preceded
the
weeks
case,
there
was
an
attempt
to
forfeit
certain
property,
not
the
application
of
a
final
penalty
but
they
were
trying
to
forfeit
certain
property
which
was
supposed
to
brought
--
been
brought
to
customs
illegally.
they
subpoenaed
him
to
produce
--
to
produce
certain
papers
and
by
the
use
of
these
papers
they
succeeded
in
forfeiting
the
property.
so
that
the
case
there
did
not
involve
a
criminal
case
at
all
and
in
such
case,
the
court
held
that
the
action
in
subpoenaing
these
documents
and
allowing
him
to
be
subpoenaed
was
wrong
and
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
so
it
has
been
applied
not
only
in
federal
prosecutions
but
in
federal
civil
cases.
there
are
a
number
of
other
cases
in
the
federal
circuit
courts
which
were
cited
by
the
petitioner,
which
also
hold
that
the
federal
government
may
not
base
a
civil
liability
on
the
--
on
property
or
evidence
which
it
should
not
have
seized
and
which
was
seized
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment.
so
i
say
the
application,
this
has
been
applied
not
solely
in
criminal
cases
but
the
federal
government
has
been
prevented
from
getting
any
benefit
and
the
victim
has
been,
every
time
the
case
has
come
before
the
court,
placed
in
status
quo.
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
way
to
placed
this
victim
in
status
quo
is
to
treat
that
evidence
as
if
it
did
not
exist,
to
freeze
it,
to
obliterate
it
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
government
and
not
to
allow
him
to
be
prejudiced
by
the
action
of
the
federal
government.
there
is
a
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
if
the
state
--
if
the
state
--
well,
of
course
the
--
say
in
new
mexico
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
did
not
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
did
receive
control
of
the
property
again,
the
state
could
conduct
an
illegal
search
and
use
it.
it
was
raised
in
the
wolf
case
but
that's
not
the
case
here,
because
he
never
got
possession
of
the
property
again.
in
that
case,
he
would
be
getting
it
the
same
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
federal
search.
the
federal
search
would
be
irrelevant
to
that
--
that
situation.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
agree
with
your
honor's
statement.
the
case
in
silverthorne,
mr.
justice
holmes
--
i
had
a
situation
where
they
were
not
directly
using
it
to
prosecute.
i
mean
it
was
not
involved
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
it
was
involved
in
a
--
it
was
an
attempt
to
subpoena
certain
papers
of
a
corporation.
and
the
corporation,
of
course,
could
not
have
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment.
so,
it
was
not
self-incrimination
that
was
involved.
a
--
illegal
search
had
been
made
in
the
corporation's
premises
and
the
federal
government
had
been
ordered
to
turn
back
the
property.
but
when
they
had
made
the
illegal
search,
they
made
copies
and
they
obtained
certain
knowledge.
and
you
--
based
on
the
knowledge
that
they
have
obtained,
they
then
issued
a
subpoena
to
the
corporation,
demanding
that
the
corporation
turn
over
the
very
documents
which
had
been
illegally
seized
in
the
first
place
of
the
term.
it
was
an
indirect
way
and
it
was
a
direct
way
of
using
the
knowledge
they
obtained
but
it
was
an
indirect
way
of
violating
the
fourth
amendment.
and
this
court
struck
down
the
acts
of
the
federal
government
and
mr.
justice
holmes,
in
that
case,
said
specifically
that
it
was
not
just
the
use
in
court
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
illegally
seized,
it
was
the
use
of
the
evidence
at
all.
he
said
the
essence
of
a
provision
forbidding
the
acquisition
of
evidence
in
a
certain
way
is
that
not
merely
evidence
so
acquired
shall
not
be
used
before
the
court
but
that
it
shall
not
be
used
at
all.
now,
the
federal
government
in
this
case
is
saying,
"well,
we
don't
have
certain
rights.
admittedly,
we
don't
the
right
to
use
it
ourselves.
but
we
do
have
some
rights.
we
had
a
right
to
turn
it
over
to
somebody
else
to
use.”
it's
like
a
thief
who's
been
caught
with
something
and
says,
"i
can't
keep
this
but
i
can
give
to
somebody
else
to
keep."
there
should
be
no
rights
attached
to
something
which
should
not
have
been
done
in
the
first
place
and
was
done
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
in
united
states
versus
wallace
&
tiernan
company,
again,
the
question
was
the
scope
of
one
of
these
suppression
orders.
there
had
been
a
return
of
certain
property
to
a
defendant
in
the
criminal
case
because
the
indictment
had
been
bad.
and
at
that
time
it
was
returned,
the
order
--
as
a
matter,
there
was
a
return
to
property
and
there
was
an
order
return.
then
there
was
a
civil
case
instituted
and
there
was
attempt
to
get
the
same
evidence
which
had
been
returned.
and
the
court,
this
court
was
there
called
upon
to
consider
whether
or
not
that
original
order,
which
had
ordered
the
property
returned,
was
extended
beyond
that
particular
proceeding.
but
it
was
conceded
that
it
could
extend
beyond
the
proceeding
and
the
only
question
in
wallace
versus
tiernan
was
whether
or
not
it
had,
had
that
effect
and
whether
it
was
intended
to
have
that
effect.
but
the
--
the
case
holds
and
the
holding
of
the
case
is
that
it
did
not.
but
the
mere
fact
that
this
court
had
to
consider
whether
you
could
have
what
they
termed
a
general
order
of
outlawry
against
the
particular
piece
of
evidence,
that
was
the
question
which
was
considered
and
concededly
that
could
have
been
the
case.
so
that
these
orders
are
broader
than
merely
applying
to
a
pending
criminal
case,
that
is
an
order
of
suppression
and
the
power
of
the
court
under
the
constitution
is
to
put
the
victim
in
the
status
quo.
another
face
of
suppression
cases
and
return
of
illegally
seized
property
is
the
deterrent
to
federal
officials
to
violate
--
not
to
violate
individual's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
and
that
was
pointed
out
in
the
wolf
case
in
distinguishing
the
wolf
case,
we're
taking
the
wolf
case
out
of
the
weeks'
doctrine.
in
the
wolf
case,
the
--
the
question
was
simply
whether
or
not
a
state
which
had
illegally
seized
certain
property
could
use
that
property
to
get
a
state
conviction
and
--
and
the
question
was
involved
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
precise
question
is
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
demanded
the
remedy
of
suppression
in
the
state
or
whether
the
states
were
free
to
adopt
their
own
remedies,
generally
a
suit
against
the
officer,
they
are
free
to
adopt
their
own
remedies
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
court
held
that
it
did,
but
in
so
holding,
it
differentiated
the
--
the
remedy
which
is
available
against
the
state
government
and
the
remedy
which
is
available
against
the
federal
government.
i
believe
the
language
that
was
used
in
that
case
was
in
differentiating
the
two
and
the
sanctions
that
are
necessary
to
keep
the
federal
government
in
line
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
--
this
was
the
language
that
was
used
at
page
32
and
33
of
that
opinion,
“the
public
opinion
of
the
community
can
far
more
effectively
be
exerted
against
oppressive
conduct
on
the
part
of
a
police
directly
responsible
to
the
community
itself.
then
local
opinions
sporadically
aroused
be
brought
to
bear
upon
remote
authority,
pervasively
exerted
throughout
the
country.”
the
weeks
case
established
that
the
only
effective
sanction
for
preventing
the
federal
government
from
violating
one's
rights
against
search
and
seizure
was
to
suppress
the
evidence,
to
treat
it
as
if
it
did
not
exist,
and
that
is
precisely
the
point
that's
involved
here.
the
question
is
what
remedy
shall
be
applied
against
the
federal
government?
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
the
federal
government
is
to
free
--
is
free
to
use
this,
to
obtain
a
state
prosecution,
then
that
remedy
would
certainly
be
weakened
or
--
or
considerably
lessened.
that
is
particularly
true
because
of
the
many
crimes
today
which
have
both
state
and
federal
faces,
including
narcotics,
income
tax
evasion,
kidnapping
and
a
whole
catalog
of
crimes
where
the
police
cooperate
closely.
if
the
federal
agents
knew
that
they
could
--
at
will,
going
to
someone's
house
and
if
per
chance,
he
might
raise
the
--
made
a
motion
to
suppress
in
a
federal
court
on
a
federal
crime
and
it
was
thrown
out,
it
could
be
confident
that
despite
his
illegal
action
that
the
evidence
could
still
be
used
in
state
court
and
that's
precisely
what
has
been
done
here.
and
if
the
agents
of
the
federal
government
knew
that
regardless
of
their
action,
when
they
have
a
crime
which
has
both
the
state
and
federal
aspect,
the
man
is
going
to
be
punished.
to
that
extent,
the
sanctions
that
are
attached
to
the
fourth
amendment
are
considerably,
and
i
say
very
much,
weakened.
and
i
submit
that
the
rationale
of
the
weeks
case
and
also
of
the
wolf
case
is
certainly
sufficient
to
embrace
the
injunction
against
federal
officials
to
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
--
to
stop
them
from
testifying.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
authority
claim.
you're
speaking
of
the
mcnabb
rule?
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
--
we
are
not
--
the
mcnabb
rule
is
not
a
constitutional
rule.
and
in
view
of
the
petitioner,
this
is
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
--
constitutional.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
the
sense
that
i
said
earlier
that
the
--
an
inherent
part
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
remedy
that
goes
with
it
of
suppression.
if
that
is
true,
then
i
think
it
applies
to
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor.
not
at
all,
because
presumably,
the
mcnabb
rule
could
be
changed
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no.
the
--
the
remedy
here
is
--
is
in
vindication
of
the
fourth
amendment,
not
the
fourteenth.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
well,
that
point,
the
point
of
whether
a
state
court
can
use
evidence
which
is
illegally
obtained,
assuming
this
case
came
up
to
a
state
court
and
that
were
before
this
court,
the
argument
and
--
which
is
supported
by
authority
in
our
brief
is
that
the
state
courts,
equally
with
the
federal
courts,
are
obliged
to
enforce
federal
rights.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i'm
talking
about
all
federal
rights
in
the
constitution,
since
the
constitution
is
the
supreme
of
all
the
land
and
justice
obliged
--
justice
binding
on
them
as
it
is
on
the
federal
court.
and
this
--
the
state
of
missouri,
the
state
of
wyoming,
the
state
of
kentucky,
and
the
state
of
tennessee
have
so
held
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
that
is
correct.
now,
there's
a
part
of
the
--
the
part
which
is
sought
to
be
exercised
that
petitioner
is
seeking
to
have
the
federal
district
court
exercise
is
an
equity
part
of
the
court.
it
has
been
exercised
ever
since
the
week
case
every
time
a
--
every
time
the
case
--
a
case
of
illegal
search
and
seizures
come
up.
the
federal
government
has
been
told
to
return
the
property
if
that's
as
far
to
suppress
it,
and
it's
a
general
equitable
part
of
the
court
which
is
being
exercised
and
well-established.
and
it's
not
necessary
in
such
case
to
show
irreparable
harm.
a
person
who's
been
--
who
has
--
had
his
rights
violated
simply
goes
in
and
shows
the
violation
of
the
right,
and
he
is
entitled
the
return
of
his
property
but
not
contraband.
if
it
is
contraband,
he's
entitled
to
suppression.
the
government
has
treated
rather
fully
in
its
brief
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
proper
form
to
raise
the
right.
now,
i
submit
that
the
authorities
which
is
cited
by
the
--
by
the
government
are
not
on
point
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
the
proper
place.
first
of
all,
the
--
there
is
no
state
law
which
is
here
involved
at
all.
we're
not
construing
--
we're
not
construing
a
federal
--
a
federal
--
i
mean
a
state
criminal
law,
we
don't
depend
in
anyway
upon
the
construction
by
the
state.
this
is
precisely
comparable
to
some
of
the
lake
segregation
cases
which
have
come
up
to
this
court.
some
have
come
up
through
the
federal
courts.
for
example,
the
latest
one,
brown
versus
kansas,
i
believe
it
was,
was
--
arose
in
a
federal
court
when
there
was
an
action
to
enjoin
state
officials.
the
texas
case
came
up
through
the
--
to
the
state
courts,
but
there
is
no
reason
why
the
federal
court
in
that
case
couldn't
consider
the
violation
of
federal
rights
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
this.
the
authorities
which
are
cited
by
the
government
as
--
as
dictating
an
opposite
result
or
first
of
all
--
or
one
of
them
is
douglas
versus
city
--
the
city
of
jeannette.
there,
there
was
a
threatened
state
prosecution
and
the
construction
of
the
state
law
was
necessary,
going
to
be
involved
in
the
federal
courts
granting
the
relief,
and
of
course,
it
was
denied
in
that
case.
in
watson
versus
buck,
which
was
a
florida
case,
they
--
there
was
involved
the
construction
of
a
very
complicated
copyright
law
in
florida
and
a
law
which
--
for
bad
certain
combinations
in
the
state
court
in
enjoining
the
law
which
had
never
even
been
construed,
i
mean
the
federal
court
in
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
such
a
law
was
taking
upon
itself
to
give
a
construction
to
the
statute
which
the
state
courts
have
not
given,
and
which
might
be
rendered
nugatory
if
the
state
court
didn't
agree
with
them
on
the
construction
of
the
statute.
besides
that,
they
were
passing
on
points
which
were
--
they
were
passing
on
a
general
application
of
the
law
when
all
the
specific
situations
under
which
it
might
arise
were
not
before
them.
and
for
that
reason,
this
court
said
it
was
improper
to
interfere
directly
as
they
did
by
an
injunction
against
state
officials
in
the
--
in
the
enforcement
of
that
copyright
law.
in
--
in
beal
versus
missouri
pacific
which
is
cited
by
the
government,
again
we
weren't
concerned
with
a
railroad
law
and
its
constitutionality.
it
had
not
been
construed
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
and
the
individual
--
the
railroad
company
in
that
case
sought
in
an
injunction
in
advance
of
construction
by
the
state.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
railroad
commission
versus
pullman
company.
in
stefanelli
versus
minard,
which
is
cited
by
the
government
as
controlling
this
case,
the
circumstances
were
entirely
different.
in
stefanelli,
the
attempt
was
made
to
directly
interfere
in
state
proceedings
by
enjoining
the
state
officials.
the
heavy
hand
of
the
federal
court
would
have
gone
out
and
interfere
with
their
activities,
rather
than
allow
the
case,
as
this
court
held
it
should,
to
come
up
to
the
state
court.
but
that
involved
a
direct
interference
and
this
court
said
that
that
would
be
an
active
intrusion
into
something
which
was
properly
a
matter
of
state
concern
for
its
instance,
and
it
again
denied
the
relief.
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
he
would
have
that
effect,
your
honor,
but
it
would
have
--
no
more
have
that
effect
in
--
if
i
may
give
an
example
in
the
weeks
case.
in
the
weeks
case,
the
marshal
illegally
seized
certain
property
and
the
federal
court
ordered
him
to
give
the
property
back
to
the
individual
from
whom
he
seized
it.
now,
it's
true
that
if
the
state
court
wanted
that
very
evidence
and
they
had
come
in
and
said,
“let
us
have
that
evidence
rather
than
give
it
back.”
that
they
wouldn't
have
gotten
the
evidence
back,
and
that
would've
to
that
extent
have
hampered
their
proceedings.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
weeks
case
would
be
any
different
simply
because
the
state
wanted
the
evidence.
i
don't
think
the
federal
court
should,
under
the
constitution,
refuse
in
such
a
situation
to
give
it
back
to
the
--
the
wronged
individual
simply
because
the
state
wants
it.
it's
true,
it
does
have
the
effect
of
hampering
their
proceedings
because
they
can't
get
a
hold
of
the
evidence.
that's
true
in
every
return
case
in
which
this
court
passes
on,
the
state
wanted
to
get
the
evidence
by
reason
of
the
fact
it's
returned
to
the
individual,
they're
not
going
to
get
it,
and
to
that
extent
they're
--
they
are
hampered.
but
that
only
means
that
the
vindication
of
the
--
of
the
individual
right
is
not
hampered
simply
by
rates
--
a
state's
right
to
prosecute.
in
conclusion,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
question
is
a
forum,
which
has
been
raised,
is
at
all
appropriate
because
the
--
the
question
which
this
court
will
consider
would
be
no
different
if
it
came
up
through
a
half
a
dozen
other
state
courts.
it's
wholly
a
federal
question
on
which
this
court
should
pass.
and
it's
not
something
that
requires
a
state
or
the
views
of
the
state
in
anyway,
because
we're
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment,
we're
talking
about
remedies
against
the
--
against
the
federal
government,
we're
talking
about
process
of
the
federal
court.
and
the
federal
court
certainly
ought
to
be
in
position
to
and
should
be
responsible
for
its
own
process
in
deciding
when
its
own
process
violates
the
--
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
so,
i
submit
that
this
is
a
proper
place
to
raise
a
point.
even
though
it
might
be
true,
it
could
also
be
raised
in
the
state
court.
there's
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
must
show
irreparable
harm
in
order
to
have
a
suppression.
there's
no
more
irreparable
harm
ought
to
be
shown
in
--
in
this
case
and
in
every
suppression
case.
and
as
the
court
knows
in
every
suppression
case,
where
you
win
in
the
federal
court,
it's
unnecessary
to
show
a
pending
prosecution.
all
that
it's
necessary
to
show
is
that
your
rights
have
been
violated
under
the
fourth
amendment,
your
property
is
taken,
and
you're
entitled
the
return
of
it
without
any
showing
of
irreparable
harm.
if
this
is
an
exception
to
the
established
equity
doctrine,
it
is
an
established
exception.
and
in
every
case
of
suppression
that
is
all
that's
necessary
in
the
point
that
it
must
--
there
must
be
irreparable
harm.
otherwise,
if
you
can't
have
your
property
back,
you've
got
to
get
a
trial.
that
point
is
over
--
that
point
is
not
substantial
in
view
of
all
the
federal
cases
which
have
not
shown
irreparable
federal
harm
--
irreparable
harm.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
--
i
do
not
argue
it
is
not,
your
honor.
i
say
it's
simply
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
i
say,
we
--
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
well,
the
government
argues
and
they
cite
in
support
of
that,
i
believe
it
did
disperse
this
jeannette
case,
which
involved
a
direct
interference
with
state
officials
and
there
it
was
said
that
that
was
not
irreparable
harm,
because
you
were
going
to
be
put
to
a
state
prosecution.
i
think
that's
the
--
the
point
of
which
the
government
relies
to
show
there
--
that
irreparable
harm
must
be
shown,
and
i
say
that
does
not
have
to
be
shown
in
suppression
cases
and
never
has
been.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
accordingly,
the
petitioner
submits
that
the
relief
prayed
for
should
have
been
granted,
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
joseph
a.
sommer
your
honor,
i
have
nothing
more
unless
there
are
some
questions
which
have
arisen
as
a
result
of
the
government's
argument.
