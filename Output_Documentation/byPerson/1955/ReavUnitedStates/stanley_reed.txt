justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
was
the
property?
justice
stanley
reed
did
the
record
show
that?
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
did
you
ask
to
be
done
with
it?
justice
stanley
reed
quash
the
search
warrant,
of
course,
that
was
done
so
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
--
what
piece
of
paper
do
you
rely
on
that
you
filed
in
the
court,
in
the
--
in
the
district
court?
justice
stanley
reed
why
did
--
here's
a
motion
on
page
3,
a
motion
to
quash
the
search
warrant?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
sole
request
that
you
have?
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
but
nothing
else?
justice
stanley
reed
where
is
that
motion?
justice
stanley
reed
well
going
--
i'm
going
back
to
that,
what
he
wanted.
he
wanted
an
injunction
forbidding
him
to
testify
in
the
state
court?
justice
stanley
reed
the
suppression
of
the
evidence,
of
course,
the
mere
suppression
of
the
evidence
and
transferring
it
out
of
the
legal
custody
would
be
of
no
of
use
to
if
he
would.
justice
stanley
reed
so,
it
will
be
all
be
covered
by
the
cause,
forbidding
in
enjoining
him
and
then
to
testifying
as
to
the
existence,
character,
and
possession?
justice
stanley
reed
so
what
you
want
the
federal
court
to
do
is
because
of
the
--
that
the
search
warrant
was
illegal
and
invalid.
you
want
them
to
--
to
order
a
federal
officer
not
to
testify
in
the
state
court?
justice
stanley
reed
what
else
is
there?
justice
stanley
reed
that
--
that
wouldn't
be
of
much
use
to
if
you
didn't
have
the
suppression
in
order
to
--
not
to
testify,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
might
be
useful.
justice
stanley
reed
what
would
--
what
would
happen
in
the
state
court
if
this
agent
was
summons
by
the
state
court
to
testify?
justice
stanley
reed
is
it
one
of
these
federal
officers
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
would
you
(inaudible)
to
the
federal
officer
concerning
the
original
into
the
state
officer?
justice
stanley
reed
after
you
get
this
--
after
you
were
successful
in
having
an
injunction
against
him?
justice
stanley
reed
but
only
after
--
what
would
be
done
if
a
day
before
you
brought
this
action?
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
the
suppressed
but
he
hadn't
been
ordered
not
to
give
any
information
to
the
state.
justice
stanley
reed
at
the
time
you
filed
this
motion.
justice
stanley
reed
and
in
considering
that,
you
have
to
consider
all
the
circumstances
of
that
--
of
the
development
of
this
case
by
the
federal
officer
and
as
to
whether
he
has
authority
or
has
the
right
to
give
the
information
that
he
unlawfully
obtained
to
the
state
authorities?
justice
stanley
reed
and
what
--
what
you
say
is
this,
wasn't
that
weeks
case
that
set
that
we're
going
to
keep
this
from
happening
because
it
interfered
with
the
progress
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
justice
stanley
reed
what
is
the
authority
that
we
have
to
enter
such
an
order
like
this
or
that
the
federal
courts
have?
the
supervision
of
the
proper
conduct
of
federal
judicial
trials?
justice
stanley
reed
i
have
that
in
mind.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
this
--
justice
stanley
reed
constitutional
in
the
sense
of
protecting
the
constitution?
justice
stanley
reed
this
is
not
a
supervision
of
the
conduct
of
a
judiciary?
justice
stanley
reed
the
section
of
the
--
of
a
constitutional
provision
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures?
justice
stanley
reed
and
the
disclosure
of
evidence
in
those
cases
which
wouldn't
be
applicable
in
a
federal
or
state
case.
justice
stanley
reed
certainly.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
find
is
whether
or
not
this
--
this
is
proceeding
a
--
merely
as
a
supervision
of
federal
courts
or
not?
or
whether
--
i
don't
just
see
how
you
get
the
constitutional
question
in
here
since
the
--
the
federal
constitution
would
not
be
violated
by
the
introduction
by
a
--
of
a
state
court
of
evidence
improperly
obtained
at
least
we
haven't
so
held.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
--
i
didn't
contend
to
bring
that
up
because
i
think
the
wolf
case
at
least
bears
on
that
which
is
to
whether
the
evidence
improperly
obtained
may
be
used
in
the
state
court.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
understand
is
just
exactly
what
authority
you
depend
to
apply,
to
authorize
the
federal
courts
to
enjoin
this
proceeding?
because
i
understand
that
while
this
explosion,
because
i
understand
your
statement
it
is
that
since
it
violated
the
federal
constitution
to
search,
that
therefore
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
obtain
any
benefit.
