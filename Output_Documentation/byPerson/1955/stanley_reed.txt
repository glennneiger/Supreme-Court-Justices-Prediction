justice
reed
so
was
it
just
one
truckload?
justice
reed
you
can
do
it
in
--
this
court
has
held
that
in
risk
versus
johnson
--
justice
reed
--
whether
it's
a
constitutional
problem
or
not.
justice
reed
as
i
understand
it
five
years
limit
on
each
crime?
justice
reed
so
you
have
two-five
years
which
is
ten
and
he's
served
his
10
years?
justice
reed
that's
the
time
for
two
offenses.
justice
reed
well,
i
--
i
have
difficulty
in
the
discrimination
and
punishment
because
heretofore
they
have
construed
the
act
in
one
way.
now,
they
can't
change
and
construe
it
in
another?
justice
reed
i've
misunderstood
what
you're
saying.
justice
reed
if
i
understood
the
hearn
case
there.
justice
reed
well,
the
statement
--
the
statement
of
the
question
presented
which
you
made,
are
--
are
they
taken
from
the
petition
for
certiorari
here?
justice
reed
there
are
--
there's
no
reason
why
they
should
be
because
the
petition
for
certiorari
was,
as
i
understand
it,
drawn
by
someone
else's
view.
justice
reed
and
you
tried
to
restate
it.
justice
reed
well
now,
the
state
also
had
take
the
stated
questions
and
the
state
is
somewhat
different
than
what
--
what
you
do.
the
state
gives
this
one
this
question
one,
which
is
the
--
for
a
lack
of
a
better
word
i'll
call
it
res
judicata.
at
any
rate,
that
you
can't
have
but
one
habeas
corpus.
have
--
have
you
treated
that
in
your
brief?
justice
reed
right.
justice
reed
and
yet
you
say
that
--
that
florida
can't
have
under
the
--
under
our
constitution,
can't
have
as
a
rule
that
the
(inaudible)
to
reexamine
problems
that
have
been
raised
or
could
be
raised?
justice
reed
but
just
denied
it.
justice
reed
(inaudible)
justice
reed
where
--
where's
that
florida
statute?
justice
reed
thank
you.
justice
reed
did
--
did
i
understand,
before
the
recess,
that
--
that
you
said
this
was
rather
a
standard
--
justice
reed
correct.
justice
reed
wasn't
the
record
in
the
florida
trial
showed
that
the
defendant
appeared
with
the
counsel?
justice
reed
it
must
have
been
--
justice
reed
(inaudible)
that
was
before
that.
