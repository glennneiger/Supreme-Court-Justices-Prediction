their
provisions
for
destroying
your
name
in
the
list
if
you're
a
member.
justice
stanley

no,
i
mean,
instead
of
the
statement
putting
your
name
on
the
list.
justice
stanley
reed
before
you
leave
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
perhaps
i
didn't
fully
understand
your
answer
to
the
immunity
section.
that
it
seems
to
go
farther
than
merely
the
facts
that
you've
stated
as
i
understood
it.
the
fact
that
the
registration
of
any
person
under
section
7
as
an
officer
or
a
member
of
any
communist
organization
should
not
be
received
in
evidence
but
then
such
a
person
in
any
prosecution
or
any
alleged
violation
of
subsection
(a)
of
this
section
or
any
alleged
violation
of
any
other
criminal
statute,
is
that
last
clause?
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
but
--
you
mean
the
fact
that
you
--
justice
stanley
reed
(voice

is
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
stanley
reed
that
otherwise
they
might
not
know
that
they
were
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
justice
stanley
reed
but
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
--
membership
cannot
be
shown
in
any
prosection?
justice
stanley
reed
the
--
the
only
remedy
is
to
withdraw
from
the
organization?
justice
stanley
reed
i
just
asked
if
that
was
his
sole
remedy?
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
i
should
remember
but
i
don't
whether
or
not
there
was
any
decision
in
the
bailey
case
as
to
the
right
of
an
organization
to
raise
these
disadvantages
of
the
members?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
--
that's
the
point
--
the
point
i
was
inquiring
about
though
was
the
right
of
the
organization
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
to
make
it
a
point
that
the
member
was
in
it?
justice
stanley

which
section
of
statute
are
you
speaking
to?
justice
stanley

is
--
is
section
3

justice

of

in

268.
justice
stanley

that's
right.
justice
stanley

yes.
justice
stanley
reed
oh,
well,
i'm
--
i
wanted
to
--
you
to
point
out
to
me
as
to
whether
or
not
this
section
here,
the
1954
act
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
--
i
think
its
1954,
yes,
1954
act
was
a
definition
of
the
communist
party
or
find
--
the
senate's
view
of
what
--
or
congress'
view
what
communist
party
was.
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
sanctions
are
there
for
refusal
to
register
after
being
directed
to
register
by
the
board?
justice
stanley
reed
and
what
are
those
sanctions?
what
(inaudible)
justice
stanley

what
section?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
are
they
--
are
they
fined
if
they
don't?
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
is
that
--
is
that
the
section
4?
justice
stanley
reed
but
that's
by
a
separate
proceeding?
justice
stanley
reed
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
stanley
reed
as
to
whether
they
failed
to
register?
justice
stanley
reed
gamblers
might
not
want
to
register.
justice
stanley
reed
and
you
say
you
don't
need
a
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
raise
it?
justice
stanley
reed
and
--
justice
stanley
reed
a
different
thing
and
the
punishments
here
are
not
criminal,
i
take
it.
justice
stanley
reed
so
you
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
--
you
do
have
disadvantages
to
this
organization
by
--
by
registration?
justice
stanley

and
this

this
question
whether
you
can
make
the
money
profitable
as
you
press
it
in
this
way
or
as
a
matter
of
