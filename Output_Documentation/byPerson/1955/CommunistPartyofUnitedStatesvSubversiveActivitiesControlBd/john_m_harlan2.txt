is
there
in
the

a

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
deal
with
mr.
abt's
argument
that
this
is
all
one
progressive
outlaw
--
outlawry
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
i
mean
is
--
what
i
understand
it
to
mean
is
could
--
do
you
think
that
congress
could
pass
a
statute
outlawing
the
communist
party
of
united
states
as
such
without
more.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
i
understand
it
to
mean
was
the
effect
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
that
isn't
quite
his
whole
argument,
is
it?
his
argument
is
that
based
with
the
sanctions
that
are
visited
upon
somebody
who
is
a
member
of
this
party
which
is
required
to
register,
the
party
is
going
to
disintegrate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
that
is
not
the
result
of
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
at
least.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
congress
on
the
basis
of
this
commission's
--
of
this
board's
findings
then
pass
a
legislation
abolishing
the
communist
party?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
was
without
a
determination
by
anybody
except
the
congressional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
am
suggesting
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
you
is
this,
supposing
the
statute
had
provided
that
--
that
the
findings
that
have
been
made
in
the
preambles
here
and
then
a
board
has
been
created
to
make
a
determination
of
fact
unnoticed
to
the
communist
party
and
so
forth.
and
then
the
board
had
made
the
determination
that
it
has
on
adequate
evidence
if
you
please
but
congress
then
followed
that
up
and
say,
"now,
we'll
abolishing
the
--
the
communist
party."
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
suggesting
they
couldn't,
i
was
asking
should
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
that's
the
nub
of
what
your
opponent
say
as
the
result
of
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
--
well,
you
--
you
say
really
we've
just
got
two
questions
before
us.
one
is
whether
the
act
of
registration,
the
act
requiring
registration
is
within
congressional
competence
and
number
two
whether
the
findings
of
the
board
were
adequate
so
if
they
should
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
just
those
two
questions
(voice
overlap)
--
