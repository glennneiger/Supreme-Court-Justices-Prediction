mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you.
if
the
court
please.
i
will
first
take
up
another
aspect
of
the
act's
denial
of
due
process
to
the
members
of
an
organization
ordered
to
register.
as
mr.
abt
has
already
pointed
out,
a
registration
order
automatically
inflicts
on
every
member
of
the
organization
certain
intolerable
sanctions
including
the
defamation
which
occurs
from
being
listed
and
that
loss
of
employment,
loss
of
passports
and
so
forth.
what
the
act
does
is
to
conclusively
presume
that
every
member
of
an
organization
is
a
disloyal
person
who
should,
there,
on
that
account,
be
excluded
from
access
to
vital
privileges.
this
presumption
applies
whether
or
not
the
member
knows
or
believes
that
the
organization
is
subversive,
and
furthermore,
the
member
never
has
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
no
matter
what
you
say
about
the
organization,
he
personally
is
not
disloyal.
this
we
say
clearly
violates
due
process.
this
court
in
two
recent
decisions
--
mr.
joseph
forer
if
the
--
you
mean,
he
--
he
could
--
yes,
he
can
withdraw
from
the
organization.
that's
a
violation
of
his
right
of
association.
in
other
words,
the
remedy
that
you're
suggesting
that
the
cure
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that
is
the
sole
remedy.
if
you
can
call
it
a
remedy,
in
other
words,
in
order
to
get
due
process,
he
has
to
sacrifice
his
first
amendment
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
only
after
the
judgment
of
this
court.
mr.
joseph
forer
of
the
board
and
if
--
if
sustained
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
now,
in
wieman
against
updegraff
and
adler
against
board
of
education,
this
court
held
that
among
other
things,
there
are
two
requirements
of
due
process
when
sanctions
for
disloyalty
are
imposed
on
account
of
organizational
membership.
the
first
of
these
is
that
the
membership
must
be
accompanied
by
actual,
personal
knowledge
of
the
organization's
alleged
subversive
character.
otherwise,
the
membership
is
obviously
not
a
rational
criterion
of
disloyalty.
the
second
requirement
is
that
a
man
cannot
be
branded
as
disloyal
in
on
that
account
denied
important
privileges
without
his
having
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
he,
in
fact,
is
loyal.
now,
obviously,
neither
of
these
two
requirements
are
met
by
the
act.
it
is
not
contented
that
they
are
and
it
follows
that
the
act
violates
due
process.
now,
the
government's
defense
is
that
the
sanctions
and
the
public
infamy
apply
only
to
a
person
who
remains
a
member
knowing
or
having
noticed
through
the
federal
register
that
the
organization
has
been
condemned
after
a
hearing
and
judicial
review
as
far
as
this
court.
it
says
that
if
a
person
chooses
to
remember
--
remain
a
member,
after
all
of
that,
then
he
deserves
what
he
gets.
but
a
hearing
for
the
organization
is
not
a
substitute
for
a
hearing
for
the
individual
and
a
determination
of
the
nature
of
the
organization
cannot
be
a
satisfactory
determination
of
the
nature
of
the
individual.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
oh,
certainly,
the
bailey,
you
mean
the
dorothy
bailey
case?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
dorothy
bailey
case
had
implied
that
solely,
the
government
employee,
this
goes
far
beyond
that.
this
is
the
question
of
whether
you
can
penalize
a
person,
deprived
of
not
--
of
private
employment,
of
passports,
of
his
livelihood
exposing
the
infamy.
mr.
joseph
forer
certainly.
as
mr.
abt
pointed
out,
members
of
the
organization,
of
a
prescribed
organization
are
deprived
not
merely
of
governmental
employment
but
of
employment
in
any
plant,
mine,
etcetera,
et
cetera
for
--
that
the
secretary
of
defense
says
has
any
relation
in
his
opinion
to
defense.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
he
thinks.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
and
there's
no
review
of
that.
mr.
joseph
forer
that
decision
was
not
in
the
bailey
case
but
it
was
the
case
decided
at
the
same
time
of
the
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
case,
and
there,
it
held
that
the
organization
did
have
a
right
to
raise
the
denial
of
due
process
to
its
members
because
of
the
effect
that
it
had
on
the
organization.
now,
as
you,
yourself,
had
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
reed,
one
of
the
effects
of
these
sanctions
on
the
members
is
to
make
them
leave
the
organization.
now,
that
--
when
you
make
a
member
leave
the
organization,
you're
destroying
the
organization
and
under
the
joint
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
their
organization
has
that
right
because
it
is
injured
by
having
its
members
driven
away
and
that
point
was
made
by
the
court
in
the
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
case
by
numerous
other
decisions
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
it
is
not
and
has
never
been
seriously
contested.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
that's
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
even
that,
i
think
we're
entitled
to
assert
both
rights.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
actually,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
opinion
in
--
and
particularly
your
opinion
in
that
case
went
further
because
as
i
--
you
said
that
all
that
was
necessary
to
show
was
an
injury
to
the
interest
of
the
organization
which
was
reasonably
direct
and
--
and
immediate.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
--
either
i
--
mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
want
to
go
on
both
hypotheses
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
because
they
both
support
my
position.
mr.
joseph
forer
as
i
say
--
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
i
have
told
you
that.
now,
in
the
adler
and
wieman
decisions,
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
constitutional
requisite
to
due
process
when
you
inflicted
--
when
government
inflicted
sanctions
on
account
of
organizational
membership
that
there
be
scienter
and
they
said
that
this
scienter
is
not
knowledge
or
notice
that
the
organization
has
been
condemned
but
knowledge
or
notice
that
the
--
but
knowledge,
not
notice,
but
actual
knowledge
that
the
organization
is
subversive.
and,
in
fact,
in
the
adler
case,
those
two
requirements
of
scienter
and
a
hearing
for
the
member,
neither
of
which
are
met
by
this
statute
were
set
out
in
adler
in
connection
with
the
statute,
which
like
this
one,
here,
disqualified
only
those
persons
who
remained
members
after
the
organization
had
had
a
hearing
and
judicial
review.
the
point
is
that
a
man
may
honestly
remain
a
member
of
the
organization
after
the
board's
order
is
sustained
because
he
honestly
disagrees
with
the
board
and
he
honestly
disagrees
with
the
decisions
of
the
court.
in
that
case,
he's
not
disloyal,
he's
just
stubborn,
maybe
he's
also
right.
and
the
government
cannot
constitutionally
brand
a
man
as
disloyal
and
deprive
him
of
vital
privileges
on
account
of
disloyalty
merely
on
the
grounds
that
he's
stubborn.
that
is
confusing
disloyalty
with
not
--
nonconformity.
and
that's
true
even
if
he
is
sufficiently
stubborn
as
to
disagree
with
the
decision
of
the
board,
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
of
this
court.
maybe
he's
agreeing
with
a
dissenting
opinion
of
this
court.
he
may
be
stubborn
and
so
agreeing
but
he
cannot
be
said
to
be
disloyal.
for
that
reason,
the
defense
made
by
the
government
of
the
absence
of
scienter
is
completely
unavailable.
the
next
--
the
next
due
process
defect
of
the
act
that
i
come
to
is
that
the
act
established
a
tribunal,
an
administrative
agency,
which
under
the
scheme
and
structure
of
the
act,
was
necessarily
biased
against
the
petitioner
and
the
members
of
which
had
a
personal
and
financial
interest
in
deciding
against
the
petitioner.
as
the
act
was
originally
written
and
as
it
existed
throughout
the
administrative
proceeding
against
the
petitioner,
the
board's
sole
function
was
to
identify
communist-action
and
front
organizations.
since
the
amendments
inserted
by
the
communist
control
act,
it
also
has
the
function
of
identifying
communist
infiltrated
organization.
now,
communist-action
and
communist
--
i
mean,
communist-front
organization,
by
definition,
depend
on
the
existence
of
a
communist-action
organization.
but
by
definition,
the
front
is
controlled
by
the
action
organization.
and
it's
obvious
that
you
can't
have
a
front
without
a
back.
now,
as
the
act
was
written,
as
congress
meant
it
to
be
written
and
as
--
as
it's
clear
from
the
whole
history
and
scheme
of
the
act,
there
was
only
one
organization
that
can
be
held
that
they
--
or
that
congress
ever
contemplated
would
be
a
communist-action
organization
and
that's
the
petitioner,
the
communist
party.
certainly,
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
if
the
petitioner,
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
is
not
a
communist-action
organization
then
there
is
no
other
organization
that
is
or
can
be
found
so
or
that
as
ever
been
accused
of
being
so.
now,
it
follows
that
if
the
board
decide
and
--
decided
in
favor
of
petitioner,
the
first
case
of
the
board,
the
one
case
that
it
--
that
was
its
entire
business
until
it
disposed
of
the
case
against
petitioner,
if
the
board
had
decided
in
favor
of
petitioner,
it
would
have
made
the
act
inoperative.
it
would
have
in
effect
repealed
this
because
there
could
be
no
organization
which
could
have
been
accused
under
the
act
once
petitioner
had
been
cleared.
the
board,
thereby,
by
deciding
in
favor
of
petitioner
would
have
eliminated
this
entire
jurisdiction
all
future
business
for
itself
and
with
it,
the
jobs
and
salaries
of
the
board
member.
the
act,
therefore,
put
the
board
under
irresistible
pressure
to
decide
against
petitioner
and
the
temptation
of
self
interest
to
solve
this
out
because
it
was
only
by
deciding
against
petitioner
that
the
board
could
preserve
the
act,
could
preserve
its
own
existence
and
could
preserve
the
jobs,
the
salaries
and
the
patronage
power
of
the
board
members.
the
board
and
the
attorney
general
have
always
recognized
and
we
cite
the
evidence
of
that
effect
in
our
brief
that
a
decision
by
the
board
in
favor
of
petitioner
would
have
eliminated
the
act,
the
board
and
the
jobs
of
the
board
members.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
now,
in
tumey
against
ohio,
and
many
cases
since,
and
as
recently
as
the
murchison
case
at
the
last
term,
this
court
repeatedly
rule
that
due
process
requires
an
impartial
tribunal,
one
that
is
not
subjected
to
pressure
and
one
that
that
does
have
an
interest
in
the
event.
clearly,
the
act
violates
this
principle
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
just
stated.
now,
the
government
doesn't
dispute
our
cases
anymore
than
it
disputes
our
facts.
instead,
it
tries
to
slip
away
from
the
point
by
saying
that
it
cannot
be
assumed
that
the
board
members
will
violate
their
oaths
of
office.
that's
beside
the
point.
violation
of
the
oath
of
office
is
a
standard
for
impeachment.
it's
not
the
standard
for
disqualification.
i
want
to
turn
now
to
various
questions
arising
out
of
section
13
(e)
of
the
act
and
its
application.
the
ultimate
issue
before
the
board
was
defined
by
section
3
(3)
of
the
act
which
gives
the
definition
of
a
communist-action
organization.
as
mr.
abt's
argument
has
indicated,
this
definition
has
two
components,
both
of
which
must
exist.
stated
briefly,
the
first
component
is
controlled
by
the
soviet
union.
the
second
component
is
that
the
organization
operate
primarily
to
advance
the
sinister
and
seditious
objectives
attributed
by
section
2
of
the
act
to
the
world
communist
movement.
mr.
abt
has
described
the
findings
made
by
section
2
on
those
objectives.
now,
section
3
is
quite
obviously
a
reasonably
clear
standard
for
adjudication.
nevertheless,
congress
set
forth
in
section
13
(e),
eight
separate
subjects
which
had
directed
the
board
to
consider
in
making
this
determination
under
the
clear
ultimate
standard
of
section
3
(3).
now,
we
analyzed
each
of
these
eight
criteria
in
detail
in
our
briefs
in
a
way
that
i
can't
attempt
to
duplicate
in
our
log.
our
conclusion
is
that
these
criteria
and
the
only
function
that
they
have
is
to
authorize
the
ultimate
finding
under
section
3
(3)
to
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
irrelevant
evidence
and
criteria
authorized
by
section
13
(e).
in
other
words,
to
permit
the
petitioner
to
be
convicted
of
one
thing
on
proof
of
another,
if
this
is
true,
it
is
clearly
a
violation
of
due
process.
we
think
that
we
have
demonstrated
that
it
is
true.
in
the
first
place,
our
analysis
of
the
13
(e)
criteria
shows
first
that
the
criteria
have
no
relevancy
of
any
kind
to
the
second
component
of
the
ultimate
definition
of
the
communist-action
organization
in
section
3
(3)
that
is
the
seditious
objectives
component.
the
government
points
to
only
one
of
the
criteria,
the
first
as
involving
objective.
but
that
criteria
is
not
limited
to
the
seditious
section
2
objective.
it
includes
the
advancement
of
any
objectives
of
the
alleged
foreign
principle.
it
could
include
the
advancement
of
the
objective
of
cultural
interchanges
such
as
working,
say
to
bring
the
soviet
chess
team
here
or
the
soviet
pianist
gilels.
those
things
would
--
could
be
evidence
under
section
13
(e)
of
promoting
the
lurid,
terror,
rustic
objectives
described
in
the
ultimate
--
and
described
in
section
2
and
incorporated
in
the
ultimate
definition.
accordingly,
the
use
of
section
13
(e)
permits
and
authorizes
a
finding
that
the
organization
advances
the
specific
evil
objective
described
in
section
2
without
any
evidence
that
it
advances
these
or
any
other
pernicious
objective.
when
we
come
to
the
other
component
of
section
3
(3),
the
situation
is
not
much
better.
the
criteria
are
either
irrelevant
to
that
subject,
the
subject
to
foreign
control
or
at
most
referred
to
tenuous
circumstantial
indications
of
foreign
control.
at
the
same
time,
they
deliberately
omit
circumstances
which
might
really
be
material
to
the
question
of
foreign
control,
to
give
one
of
the
easier
examples
and
not
to
cause
for
too
great
analysis.
one
of
the
criteria
of
section
13
(e)
is
receipt
by
the
accused
organization
of
foreign
financial
aid.
i
might
say
that
it's
admitted
on
this
record
that
that
criterion
was
improved.
but
i'm
talking
now
about
the
act
on
its
face.
now,
obviously,
the
bare
fact
of
financial
aid
doesn't
have
much
tendency
to
prove
that
the
donor
controls
the
donee
nor
does
it
prove
that
one
or
the
other
is
necessarily
bad.
everybody
knows
that
good
people
give
--
sometimes
give
money
to
bad
causes
and
even
more
frequently,
bad
people
give
money
to
good
cause,
but
you
can't
say
that
one
--
the
donor
necessarily
controls
the
donee.
now,
both
the
court
below
and
the
respondent
acknowledged
our
argument
and
they
say
they
agree
with
us
that
the
really
significant
circumstances
are
the
terms
and
conditions,
the
strings
attached,
if
any,
on
which
financial
aid
is
given
and
accepted.
but
that
is
the
scheme
of
13
(e),
it
leaves
out
the
really
significant
question
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
financial
aid
and
just
leaves
in
something
that
congress
thought
might
be
provable
although
it
wasn't
true
of
the
bare
fact
of
financial
aid.
mr.
joseph
forer
i'm
coming
to
that.
i
don't
know.
the
government
argues
that
it
isn't
exclusive
and
it
says
that
the
board
can
consider
matter
outside
of
the
eight
criteria.
now,
i
don't
know
if
that's
true
or
not.
but
if
it
is
true,
the
use
of
some
unlisted
rational
standard
can't
cure
an
act
which
directs
and
authorizes
the
use
of
irrational
standard.
in
other
words,
the
most
you
might
have
is
a
decision
on
a
mixture
of
rational
and
irrational
standard
and
such
a
mixture
is
just
irrational
as
if
you
left
out
rational
elements
altogether.
moreover,
to
the
extent
that
your
suggestion
that
the
--
and
that
the
government
suggestion,
to
the
extent
that
that
answer
our
suggestion
that
saves
the
act
on
its
face,
it
condemns
the
application
of
the
act
by
the
board,
because
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
examine
the
board's
report
to
discover
that
the
board
did
treat
section
13
(e)
as
exclusive
and
that
it
did
not
use
the
escape
hatch
which
the
government
says
now
is
a
--
the
report
takes
up
each
criterion
of
13
(e),
each
of
one
of
the
eight
separate
critera.
it
makes
a
finding
adverse
of
petitioner
in
each
one
and
then
on
this
basis
and
without
more,
it
says
petitioner
is
guilty.
in
other
words,
the
board
did
convict
petitioner
of
one
thing,
in
section
3
(3)
definition
on
proof
of
another
on
what
was
utmost
proof
of
another
the
criteria
of
section
13
(e).
now,
i
want
to
go
further,
because
it
happens
at
--
even
13
(e)
was
improved,
let
alone
3
(3).
what
the
board
did
for
lack
of
evidence
relevant
even
to
the
irrelevant
standards
of
13
(e),
it
had
a
torture,
twist,
misapply
and
misinterpret
each
of
the
13
(e)
criteria
in
making
its
findings.
now,
in
the
first
place,
i
want
to
call
to
your
attention
that
the
court
below
struck
two
of
these
eight
key
findings
in
basis
of
the
ultimate
findings
by
the
board.
the
court
below
struck
two
of
these
eight
key
findings
because
they
were
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
those
are
the
findings
that
the
board
made
upon
reporting
and
secret
practices.
and
the
government's
brief
makes
no
attempt,
now,
to
say
to
justify
these
two
findings
which
the
court
below
struck.
actually,
they
all
go
further.
they
actually
only
briefed
four
of
the
eight
findings,
but
i'll
come
back
to
that.
now,
the
board's
order
was
based
not
on
six
findings
but
on
the
totality
of
the
eight
key
findings
under
section
13
(e).
since
the
court
below
invalidated
two
of
these
key
findings,
it
follows
that
the
order
cannot
be
sustained
on
the
grounds
on
which
it
rested
and
the
grounds
which
the
administrative
agency
made
its
decision.
now,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear,
therefore,
that
under
these
court's
decisions
in
the
virginia
electric
and
power
case
and
in
the
chenery
case,
the
court
below
erred
in
affirming
the
board's
order.
at
a
minimum,
it
was
obliged
to
remand
the
case
for
administrative
predetermination
and
the
light
of
its
holding
that
two
of
the
key
findings
on
which
the
board
acted
were
erroneous.
but
it's
also
apparent
and
this
made
a
remand,
although
more
vital,
that
the
board
misapplied
the
six
remaining
criteria
of
section
13
(e)
even
if
we
forget
the
fact
that
the
court
struck
two
findings
under
two
of
the
criteria.
the
board
no
longer
defends
two
of
its
findings
under
the
six
remaining
after
the
court's
action.
those
are
the
findings
on
financial
aid
and
on
instruction
and
training.
concededly,
the
practices
to
which
those
findings
refer,
if
they
ever
existed
or
discontinued
years
before
enactment
of
the
act,
that
is
clear
from
the
base
of
the
report
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
board
no
longer
attempts
to
brief
the
sufficiency
of
the
findings.
so,
now,
the
board,
having
decided
against
petitioner
on
the
basis
of
eight
key
findings
is
able
to
defend
only
four.
now,
in
our
brief,
we
show
that
these
four
also
were
improperly
made.
i
can't
take
time
to
examine
all
of
them.
i
just
will
briefly
examine
two
of
it.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
four
was
defining
on
directives
and
policies
which
is
the
first
criteria,
the
finding
on
non-deviation
which
is
the
second
criteria,
the
finding
on
discipline
which
is
the
sixth
criteria
and
the
finding
on
allegiance
which
is
the
eight
criteria.
i
may
say
in
passing
that
the
common
attribute
of
all
those
four
policies
is
views
and
opinions,
policies,
non-deviation
from
views
and
subjective
attitude,
because
the
discipline
and
allegiance
standards,
as
written,
referred
a
subjective
attitude.
now,
i
don't
want
to
--
i
can't,
in
my
time,
cover
in
detail
of
all
those
findings
than
to
all
that
we've
tried
to
pick
up
with
perhaps
one
or
two
of
them.
the
first
of
the
surviving
findings,
the
four
that
the
board
defends
was
that
the
petitioner
acts
pursuant
to
soviet
directives
and
to
effectuate
soviet
policy.
now,
the
board
here
met
with
the
difficulty
that
it
couldn't
find
anything
which
resembled
a
foreign
directive
at
any
time
after
1940
which
is
the
date
when
the
petitioner
disaffiliated
from
the
communist
international
which
in
turn
dissolved
in
1943.
the
board,
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
any
evidence
of
directives
in
the
last
15
years,
therefore,
invented
a
theory
of
its
own.
it
said
that
the
so-called
marxist
classics,
the
writings
of
marx,
engels,
lenin
and
stalin,
most
of
them
were
written
before
there
was
a
soviet
union
or
a
petitioner
and
some
written
as
far
back
as
100
years
ago
show
from
their
texts,
from
their
texts
that
they
are
soviet
directives
promulgated
by
the
soviet
union
to
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
then
it
said,
since
petitioner
admits
that
it
thinks
these
are
great
books
and
that
it
is
guided
by
these
books
and
that
it
is
guided
by
marx
and
engels
and
so
forth,
then,
by
agreeing
with
those
principles,
it
is
accepting
both
soviet
directives
which
are
embodied
in
those
books.
now,
this
is
obviously
a
wild
distortion
of
the
first
criterion
of
section
13
(e)
that,
if
it
is
to
make
any
sense,
if
it
has
any
constitutional
validity
at
all,
must
refer
to
real
directives,
not
to
some
voluntary
adherence
to
the
100-year-old
principles
of
communism.
i
might
mention
the
second,
the
non-deviation
criterion,
that's
the
second
of
the
fourth
key
findings,
that
criterion,
the
finding
on
that
was
based
on
testimony
that
the
petitioner
and
the
soviet
union
hold
similar
views
on
44
different
issues
in
international
affairs.
well,
on
--
in
using
the
testimony
on
these
44
different
issues,
the
board
made
at
least
four
mistakes
of
law.
by
definition,
non-deviation
is
and
must
be
a
failure
to
depart
from
an
already
existing
standard,
the
already
existing
or
already
established
position
of
another.
the
board,
however,
ruled
that
it
was
irrelevant
whether
the
petitioner's
view
came
first
or
whether
the
soviet
review
came
first.
obviously,
this
in
itself
converted
the
concept
of
non-deviation
from
mere
similarity
and
prevents
the
concept
from
having
any
tendency
to
prove
foreign
control
or
the
advancement
of
another's
objective.
the
second
error
of
the
board
in
applying
non-deviation
was
its
refusal
to
consider
whether
the
views
in
question
were
true
or
reasonable
or
accepted
by
many
non-communist
or
even
that
it
was
accepted
as
the
official
policy
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
if
non-deviation
does
have
any
tendency
to
prove
foreign
control,
it
must
be
limited
to
views
which
are
at
least
distinctive
of
the
alleged
foreign
principle.
yet,
as
mr.
abt
pointed
out,
the
board
in
making
this
finding,
took
into
account
such
widely
held
and
reasonable
views
--
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired
now.
mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you,
your
honor.
because
my
time
is
running
out,
i
can
just
touch
lightly
on
some
--
a
few
of
the
remaining
subjects
that
we
wanted
to
discuss.
one
of
our
points
is
that
the
board's
order
must
be
set
aside
because
of
the
board's
improper
reliance
on
remote
and
discontinued
practice.
the
government
agrees
with
us
that
the
board's
findings
and
order
under
the
act
had
to
be
based
upon
relevant
policies
and
practices
of
the
petitioner
subsequent
to
the
date
of
the
act.
but
if
you
look
at
the
board's
report,
you'll
find
that
the
board
didn't
base
itself
upon
that
at
all.
the
report
ranges
over
the
entire
33-year
history
of
the
petitioner
mingling
into
one
big
stew,
a
few
shreds
of
alleged
contemporary
happenings
and
a
great
bulk
of
remote
matters.
most
of
the
report
deals
with
the
1920's
and
the
1930's
which
was
the
period
before
petitioner
disaffiliated
in
1940
from
the
communist
international,
which
as
i
said
earlier,
itself
dissolved
in
1943.
the
report
shows
that
these
practices,
if
they
ever
existed,
were
discontinued
years
ago,
yet
despite
change
in
circumstances,
despite
the
uncontradicted
denials
of
petitioner's
witnesses,
the
board
indulged
in
a
presumption
that
these
practices
which
had
been
discontinued,
if
they
ever
existed
for
at
least
15
years,
were
still
in
effect
and
so
did
the
court
below.
now,
the
only
defense
that
the
government
makes
is
to
say
that
well,
the
board
really
didn't
indulge
in
the
presumption
but
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
the
board's
report
at
the
place
cited
by
our
brief,
read
the
court's
decision
and
you
will
see
that
it
did
indulge
in
that
presumption,
that
presumption
itself
was
legal
error
requiring
the
setting
aside
of
the
decision
below.
on
the
question
of
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
i
want
to
call
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
under
this
act,
the
board's
findings
must
be
supported
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
in
place
of
the
usual
standard
of
substantial
evidence.
much
of
what
i've
already
said
such
as
the
board's
torturing
of
the
standards,
the
13
(e)
and
it's
reliance
on
remote
evidence
already
indicates
how
lacking
in
evidentiary
support
the
board's
order
is.
but
perhaps
the
most
vivid
illustration
appears
in
the
opinion
below.
there
you'll
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
sustained
the
ultimate
finding
on
the
basis
of
six
factors.
this
boiled
down
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
says
it
adheres
the
marxist
principles
that
its
ultimate
goal
is
a
classless,
stateless
world
that
it
calls
itself
the
communist
party
and
that
it
takes
positions
on
foreign
policy
similar
to
those
taken
by
the
soviet
union.
that's
the
basis
on
which
the
court
sustained
the
order.
all
these
facts
petitioner
stated
in
its
answer
to
the
attorney
general's
petition
before
the
board
and
petitioner
has
always
proclaimed
them.
they
do
not
and
they
cannot
prove
the
petitioner
is
under
soviet
control
or
operates
to
advance
the
terrible
objectives
described
in
section
2
of
the
act.
i
can't
dwell
on,
but
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
our
motion
for
leave
to
adduce
additional
evidence
made
in
the
court
below
and
denied
by
it.
the
act
authorizes
the
reviewing
court
to
return
the
case
to
the
board
to
receive
additional
evidence
on
a
showing
that
the
evidence
is
material.
we
move
to
reopen
for
this
purpose,
showing
that
after
the
administrative
proceeding
was
over,
three
of
the
attorney
general's
principal
witnesses,
harvey
matusow,
paul
crouch
and
manning
johnson
have
so
exposed
themselves
as
perjurers
that
the
department
of
justice
had
itself
abandoned
their
youth,
recognizing
their
other
unreliability.
the
denial
of
that
motion
compromises
the
administration
and
reputation
of
justice.
i
think
if
you
will
read
the
motion
and
the
affidavit
of
the
facts
on
which
the
motion
is
based,
i
think
your
consciences
must
and
will
be
shocked.
i
want
to
conclude
and
in
summary
by
saying
that
the
act
and
its
application
here
are
an
unprecedented
invasion
as
mr.
abt
pointed
out,
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
constitution
in
our
very
democratic
society.
this
act
was
enacted
in
the
excitement
of
the
korean
war.
in
the
name
of
anti-communism
and
the
familiar
but
spurious
cry
of
security,
it
would
enforce
conformity
by
suppressing
peaceable
advocacy
and
association
using
the
odious
technique
of
governmental
defamation,
not
only
of
people
but
of
writings
and
ideas.
inevitably,
this
police
state
objective
generated
police
state
procedures.
the
act
and
the
board's
order
coerce
self-incrimination.
they
determine
guilt
by
fire,
paid
labor
writings,
they
establish
arbitrary
and
irrational
standards
of
proof,
the
act
creates
a
biased
tribunal
that
has
an
interest
in
the
event,
it
deprives
individuals
of
their
livelihood
and
liberty
for
innocent
association
and
in
this
case
the
reckless
use
of
unreliable
witnesses
has
been
condoned.
if
these
breaches
of
the
constitution
can
be
upheld
against
the
petitioner
and
its
members,
they
can
be
and
they
will
be
used
against
other
organizations
and
individuals.
the
act
has
already
moved
on
from
the
communist
party,
the
so-called
communist
fund
organizations,
the
so-called
communist-infiltrated
labor
unions.
having
started
to
outlaw
the
communist
party,
it
can
go
on
with
a
techniques
used
by
the
board
here
to
destroy,
say,
the
ada
or
the
naacp
or
the
fund
for
the
republic.
we
say
and
we
think
the
record
in
this
case
bears
this
out
that
this
position
of
this
case
will
determine
whether
traditional
liberties
in
this
country
already
severely
restricted
will
survive.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
i
have
about
two
minutes,
chief.
mr.
joseph
forer
as
i
understand
the
solicitor
general,
he
now
in
substance
concedes
that
a
registration
order
against
an
accused
organization
for
all
practical
purposes
will
destroy
it
or
cripple
it,
proscribe
it,
outlaw
it,
put
it
out
of
business,
call
it
what
you
will.
nevertheless,
he
says
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case.
he
says
nobody
has
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government,
of
course
that's
true
and
i
put
aside
for
the
moment
the
question
that
there
was
no
proof
of
such
a
conspiracy
in
this
case.
let's
assume
there
was
proof.
let's
assume
it
was
proved
that
the
communist
party
is
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
you
can
punish
that
conspiracy,
if
the
court
please,
but
you
can't
prohibit
a
conspirator
and
this
is
the
chief
justice's
illustration
if
i
understood
it,
you
can't
prohibit
that
conspirator
from
engaging
in
legitimate
peaceful
advocacy.
solicitor
general
says
but
none
of
their
advocacy
is
legitimate
or
peaceful
because
it's
all
for
a
bad
motive.
when
they
say
we're
against
race
discrimination,
when
they
say
we're
for
higher
wages,
when
they
say
we're
for
peace,
they
are
really
doing
this
as
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government.
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
one
of
the
oldest
devices
of
intolerance
was
--
is
to
say,
"yes,
you're
doing
a
good
thing
but
we're
punishing
you
because
they
do
it
for
a
bad
purpose."
as
soon
as
the
government
has
the
power
to
punish
a
legitimate
activity
because
it
labels
that
activity
as
being
done
for
a
bad
purpose,
you've
armed
a
government
with
the
power
to
suppress
all
legitimate
activity.
