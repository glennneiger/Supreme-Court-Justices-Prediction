mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
--
the
arguments
which
you've
just
heard
seek
to
cast
the
question
in
terms
of
a
violation
of
a
first
amendment
but
we
do
not
see
the
case
in
that
light,
and
we'd
like
to
be
understood
at
the
outset
to
agree,
nay,
to
insist
that
utterance,
however
it
may
diverge
from
popular
opinion
or
from
official
opinion
and
no
matter
how
close
or
odious,
is
permitted
and
protected.
and
efforts
to
change
people's
minds
and
beliefs
are
immune
from
any
interference
under
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
a
man
is
free
to
preach
any
doctrine.
but
in
--
in
preaching
doctrine,
the
couples
there
with
conspiratorial
plans
to
employ
illegal
means
to
subvert
and
destroy
this
government,
congress
may
deal
with
it
and
the
first
amendment
does
not
stand
in
the
way.
a
mention
was
made
here
of
the
president's
veto.
the
president
made
some
very
serious
criticisms
about
this
bill
which
was
passed
over
his
veto
as
the
court
knows,
but
he
has
this
very
significant
sentence
which
is
the
only
pertinent
sentence
to
this
case,
the
president
said,
"insofar
as
the
bill
would
require
a
registration
of
the
communist
party
itself,
it
does
not
endanger
our
traditional
liberties."
in
a
document
that
stresses
the
importance
of
these
liberties,
this
distinction
is
clearly
recognized.
now,
what
is
the
history
and
background
of
this
statute?
we
can't
consider
the
thing
in
a
vacuum.
let
me
review
briefly
what
led
to
this
enactment.
what
was
the
world
situation
in
1950
when
congress
enacted
this
law?
for
a
generation
or
more,
congress
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
world
has
been
observing
the
activities
of
a
world
communist
movement
that
has
its
center
in
moscow.
as
early
as
1931,
almost
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago,
william
z.
foster,
the
present
president
of
this
organization
boldly
told
a
committee
of
congress
that
more
advanced
workers
in
this
country
look
upon
the
soviet
union
as
their
country.
congress
--
that
they
held
a
whole
series
of
coup
de
tat
in
europe.
they
had
seen
successively
this
following
up
by
the
soviet
union
through
military
aggression
of
some
of
its
neighbors
like
latvia,
lithuania,
estonia,
parts
of
poland
and
finland
and
congress
had
also
witnessed
as
that
of
the
whole
world
that
this
world
communist
movement
directed
by
the
soviet
union
had
by
infiltration,
by
subversion,
by
fraud,
deceit
and
the
threat
of
force
where
force
was
not
necessary.
they
had
taken
czechoslovakia
and
hungary,
romania,
albania
and
for
a
time
yugoslavia
and
bulgaria.
and
congress
had
not
failed
to
note
what
a
single
quisling
could
accomplish
in
a
strategic
position
and
that
since
strong
attempts
made
by
the
same
methods
to
dominate
greece
and
iran
and
italy
and
france.
and
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world,
congress
had
noted
with
consternation
the
steady
growth
of
this
international
movement
and
it's
taking
over
in
the
most
populous
nation
on
the
earth,
china.
and
they
have
noticed
obvious
preparatory
moves
to
take
over
other
parts
of
asia.
moreover,
congress
had
only
three
months
before
the
passage
of
this
law,
who
voted
funds,
to
raise
an
army
to
send
it
to
korea
to
resist
aggression
of
the
same
--
from
the
same
source,
neither
congress
nor
the
president
nor
the
nation
thought
that
these
events
were
of
slight
significance
to
our
safety.
moreover,
there
was
a
certain
characteristic
that
was
employed
in
this
world
communist
movement
and
it
was
emerging
into
clear
view.
evidence
of
espionage
in
england
arranged
through
klaus'
books
and
in
canada
through
gouzenko,
who
like
books
later
confessed,
that
had
become
known
and
while
congress
did
that
then
know
about
petrov's
espionage
in
australia
or
maclean
and
burgess
in
england.
the
judgment
that
congress
expressed
in
1950
have
since
then
been
confirmed
by
later
revelations
and
congress
was
not
unaware
what
was
going
on
at
home.
in
1949,
the
year
before
the
passage
of
this
act,
there
had
been
the
conviction
of
the
10
leading
officials
of
this
communist
party
of
the
u.s.a.,
the
very
men
who
are
leading
this
movement
and
that
conviction
had
been
affirmed
only
a
month
before
the
act
was
passed.
now,
as
a
result
of
these
manifestations,
congress
had
become
convinced
as
all
the
world
had
been
convinced
that
there
exists
a
communist
--
a
world
communist
movement
and
they
have
become
convinced
too
of
its
eventual
purpose
that
it
was
directed
toward
other
nations
and
toward
this
nation
in
particular
because
it
was
regarded
as
the
chief
bourgeoise
imperialist
power.
so,
summing
it
all
up,
i
think
it
is
an
understatement
to
say
that
there
was
at
least
primary
--
a
prima
facie
evidence.
some
would
say
it
was
overwhelming
evidence
that
this
world
movement
had
a
well-organized
agent
or
agents
in
this
country.
congress
had
also
observed
with
mounting
concern
that
there
was
not
only
this
dennis
conviction
but
that
the
party
had
from
time
to
time
in
its
propaganda
and
its
activities
faithfully
reflected
the
soviet
union's
position,
sometimes
reversing
itself
with
startling
suddenness
always
acting,
however,
in
consonance
with
the
soviet
union
ships
of
policy.
now,
mr.
justice
jackson
summarized
it
in
a
sentence,
he
said,
"a
chain
of
command
from
the
kremlin
to
the
american
party
is
stoutly
denied
and
usually
invisible
but
is
it
was
unmistakably
disclosed
by
the
american
communist
party
somersaulting
in
synchronization
with
ships
in
the
kremlin
foreign
policy."
now,
i
will
not
take
time
to
recount
the
details
of
how
when
this
soviet
union
zigged,
they'd
zigged
along
and
when
the
soviet
union
zagged,
they
zagged
too
and
when
the
soviet
union
took
snuff,
they
would
sneeze.
now,
the
petitioner
admits
that
there
is
a
world
communist
movement
but
it
claims
that
it's
a
loose
affiliation
that
its
comprised
of
separate
independent
parties
that
there's
no
time,
loyalty
or
discipline
between
it
and
the
soviet
union.
it's
only
a
fraternal
or
philosophic
affiliation.
it's
more
like
a
chess
club
as
you
heard
here
this
morning,
a
group
of
nature
lovers,
a
sort
of
a
glorified
boy
scout
movement.
now,
that's
not
the
conception
that
events
require
us
to
have
of
that
party.
congress
did
not
believe
these
professions
of
disaffiliation
and
there
was
ample
evidence
to
support
the
view
that
that
disaffiliation
was
not
sincere,
it's
a
spurious
move.
the
testimony
in
this
case
by
one
of
the
officers
of
the
petitioner,
mrs.
flynn,
was
that
it
was
friendly
divorce
in
1940,
a
friendly
divorce,
a
sort
of
a
divorce
by
mutual
consent
by
proclamation.
it
was
something
to
present
to
the
world
and
gouzenko
said,
"announcement
of
the
dissolution
of
the
comintern
was,
probably,
the
greatest
farce
of
the
communist
in
recent
years.
only
the
name
was
liquidated,
with
the
object
of
reassuring
world
opinion
in
the
democratic
countries."
actually,
the
comintern
exists
and
continuous
its
work.
now,
all
this
was
before
the
commission,
not
only
the
royal
commission
in
canada
but
it
was
before
the
sacb,
and
sacb
concluded
that
the
evidence
preponderates
wasn't
merely
some
supporting
evidence,
it
preponderates
to
establish
that
the
disaffiliation
was
for
the
expedient
of
avoiding
registration
as
a
foreign
agent
and
that
it
did
not
alter
the
party's
relationship
to
the
communist
international
or
the
world
communist
movement.
in
other
words,
would
--
business
was
going
on
as
usual.
it
was
only
a
friendly
divorce.
now,
the
record
also
shows
that
the
party
changed
its
name
in
1943,
it
became
no
longer
the
communist
party,
it
was
known
as
the
communist
political
association.
but
in
--
that
was
during
the
war
when
they
wanted
to
create
a
semblance
of
unity
with
the
american
people.
as
soon
as
the
war
was
over
and
russia's
interest
seemed
to
diverge
from
that
of
this
country,
they
again
reconstituted
themselves
as
the
communist
party
of
the
u.s.a.
this
very
tactic
of
name
changing
is
that
according
to
the
documents
of
the
communist
international
thesis
treated
as
an
approved
method
of
concealment.
now,
congress
whatever
else
may
be
said
about
them,
they
don't
have
to
be
na√Øve
as
little
red
riding
hood
who
wondered
about
grandma's
big
ears.
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
view
the
facts
and
to
make
their
appraisal
and
to
draw
their
inferences.
now,
with
this
body
of
knowledge
and
experience,
congress
declared
their
--
the
existence
of
a
danger
and
the
vitality
--
the
validity
of
these
congressional
findings
that
is
the
existence
of
the
peril,
i
respectfully
submit,
must
be
accepted
by
this
court
if
there's
any
rational
basis
for
congress
to
believe.
i
submit
that
it's
almost
difficult
to
imagine
a
rational
basis
for
disbelieving
it.
now,
coming
now
to
the
validity
of
the
law
itself,
what
are
the
issues
that
are
here?
it's
important
to
know
that
before
we
start
with
the
consideration
of
the
law.
the
whole
law
is
not
properly
an
issue
here.
there's
no
reason
why
this
court
should
go
into
every
possible
imaginary
case
that
may
or
may
not
arise
in
the
future.
when
communist-front
organizations
are
moved
against
and
anyone
fancies
that
its
rights
have
been
violated,
this
court
will
be
here
to
protect
it
--
to
protect
them,
but
it
is
not
necessary
and
now
when
you're
dealing
with
a
communist
party
of
the
united
states
to
imagine
cases
that
have
not
yet
arisen
and
that
may
never
arise,
we're
dealing
with
this
party.
now,
there's
no
so-called
front
organization
here.
there's
no
record
involving
any
individual
here
and
these
hypothetical
cases
do
not
call
for
determination
now.
so
far
as
the
party
is
concerned
there's
only
one
command
in
this
order,
the
command
is
registration
and
the
consequences
to
the
party
are
simply
that
it
must
label
its
propaganda,
there's
no
prohibition
of
their
preaching,
disseminating
their
doctrines.
they
must
label
their
publications
and
their
broadcasts
to
identify
the
source
and
also
deductions
that
people
make
to
their
--
i
mean
contributions
that
people
make
to
them
are
not
tax
deductible.
my
contributions
to
the
republican
party
are
not
tax
deductible
either
and
the
many
patriotic
people
who
contribute
to
the
democratic
party
suffer
the
same
fate.
so,
i
don't
think
it's
a
great
depravation
to
the
communist
party
to
say,
"we
will
no
longer
recognize
them
as
a
charitable
institution
entitled
to
special
treatment."
congress
has
certainly
the
right
to
take
that
step.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
exactly.
exactly
so,
even
have
his
remedy
by
injunction.
may
i
say
this,
i'm
authorized
by
the
attorney
general
to
say
this.
in
the
legislative
history,
you'll
find
some
discussion
in
the
senate,
not
when
this
law
was
passed
but
when
the
1954
act,
a
much
more
drastic
law
was
passed.
that
1954
act
undertakes
to
amend
in
some
respects
the
1950
act,
one
of
the
chief
amendments
was
that
it
included
a
new
classification,
communist
infiltrated
organizations.
the
old
law
dealt
merely
with
communist-action
and
communist-front
organizations.
and
then
incidentally,
it
revised
certain
--
under
appeal
certain
sections.
and
in
this
senatorial
discussion,
there
was
some
intimation
that
perhaps
sanctions
became
operative
at
once
against
people
--
against
members
and
it
appears
has
been
expressed
by
some
people
writing
about
this
thing
that,
"what
does
that
mean?
does
that
mean
that
a
person
who
is
not
listed
with
whom
the
attorney
general
may
think
ought
to
be
listed
may
wake
up
to
find
that
he's
been
violating
the
law
and
that
he
is
subject
to
penalties?"
i'm
authorized
by
the
attorney
general
to
say
that
no
such
person
will
be
proceeded
against
except
by
notice
on
the
hearing.
i
don't
mean
that
there
will
be
a
hearing
as
to
the
nature
of
the
communist
party.
there
will
be
a
fair
hearing
as
to
his
relation
to
the
communist
party
and
as
to
his
knowledge
but
the
whole
thing
is
really
going
to
be
academic.
no
person
can
even
under
the
law
without
any
interpretation,
emulative
interpretation,
be
proceeded
against
who,
even
if
he's
listed,
wishes
to
disaffiliate.
now,
i
know
we
in
a
democracy
have
great
tolerance
for
stubborn
people,
but
i
think
it's
carrying
stubbornness
to
a
great
extreme
to
say
that
a
man
may
go
on
and
persist
in
membership
in
an
organization
after
it
has
been
adjudicated
by
this
board
created
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
matter
and
with
the
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
after
this
court
has
considered
the
matter.
and
he
can
say,
"i
still
don't
believe
that
it's
a
foreign-dominated
organization
that
has
these
nefarious
purposes
that
have
been
attributed
to
it,
i
insist
on
belonging
to
it."
i
think
that's
carrying
it
too
far.
this
is
not
mere
political
association,
this
is
conspiracy
to
destroy
the
government
and
the
whole
fallacy
of
the
arguments
that
you've
heard
is
that
they
are
predicated
on
a
so-called
political
party
character
of
the
communist
party.
it's
true
it
has
some
of
the
character
--
characteristics
of
a
political
party.
it
has
slogans.
it
has
a
philosophy.
it
calls
itself
a
party.
all
that
would
be
all
right
no
matter
what
doctrine
they
preached
but
they
go
beyond
that.
the
evidence
has
established
and
on
judicial
review
that
has
been
affirmed
that
this
party
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
an
international
movement
dominated
by
the
soviet
union
and
that
its
purpose
is
by
force
and
violence
if
necessary
to
take
over
this
government.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
all
right.
i'll
answer
it
this
way.
in
the
first
place,
i
know
that
your
honor's
question
pertains
to
the
world
communist
movement,
not
to
the
character
of
this
petitioner,
the
world
communist
movement.
if
you'll
ask
me
as
to
whether
congress
may
declare
that
there
exists
a
world
communist
movement
and
its
characteristics,
i
say
congress
can
and
has
done
so.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they
can
say
it
and
they
have
said
it
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
before
the
board
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
but
they
are
--
they
were
overborne
by
other
testimony.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
this
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
statute
does
not
conclude
their
character,
their
affiliation
and
the
nature
of
their
activity.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
statute
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
congress
has
not
foreclosed
the
issue
as
to
this
party,
this
petitioner,
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
that
issue
was
referred
to
the
board.
that
issue
was
litigated.
they
put
on
witnesses
who
gave
testimony
as
to
their
version,
you
heard
it
summarized
in
the
arguments
here.
the
government
had
other
testimony
and
the
board,
in
a
lengthy
opinion
which
reviews
all
the
testimony,
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
that
is
not
their
purpose
as
they
say.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it's
not
chess
club.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
--
that
is
not
--
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
foreclosed
that
issue
and
they
did
not
so
interpret
it.
they
--
if
that
could
be
argued,
it
wasn't
argued
and
the
government
did
not
seek
to
foreclose
it.
they
gave
them
the
opportunity.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
know
that
there's
a
difference
of
opinion
in
the
court
as
to
how
far
you
can
go
in
respect
to
belief,
but
we
don't
have
to
be
theoretical
about
this
in
this
case.
no
possible
residue
of
belief
in
innocence
is
left
by
--
by
this
testimony.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
legislative
prejudgment
of
that
issue.
i
think
it
was
fully
presented
and
fully
answered
in
the
findings
of
the
board
and
affirmed
by
the
--
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
now,
i
don't
know
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
in
mind.
of
course
i
want
to
draw
a
distinction
between
a
congressional
finding
as
to
the
nature
of
the
world
communist
movement
and
a
congressional
finding
as
to
this
petitioner.
congress
has
made
a
finding
of
fact
as
to
the
nature
of
the
world
communist
movement,
that's
i
think
in
section
2
of
the
act
of
1950,
this
act.
but
even
that
finding,
though
i
fully
believe
that
congress
was
within
its
right
to
characterize
the
world
communist
movement,
even
that
finding
was
amply
supported
because
there
are
two
sides
of
the
coin
in
the
course
of
proving
the
relationship
of
the
communist
party
of
america
to
the
world
communist
movement,
the
nature
of
the
world
communist
movement
itself
was
also
fully
established.
now,
registration
is
all
that's
before
the
court
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
section
3
is
the
one
that
i
think
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
on
page
229
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
oh,
in
our
brief?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
of
the
--
of
the
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
petitioner,
yes,
sir.
268?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
now,
your
honor,
you're
looking
at
--
now
at
the
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
1954
act.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
is
not
the
act
that
is
before
you.
the
only
thing
that's
really
pertinent
here
is
at
the
end
of
the
second
paragraph
on
page
268,
there
is
the
proviso
that
nothing
in
this
section
shall
be
construed
as
amending
the
internal
security
act
of
--
of
1950
as
amended.
and
as
mr.
abt
frankly
stated
that
statute
is
not
before
the
court
now
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
proceeding.
now,
so
far
as
--
is
there
something
you
wanted
to
point
out
to
me,
mr.
justice
reed,
as
to
269?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
was
there
referred
to
in
that
section
3.
but
you
see
it's
not
applicable
to
this
proceeding
so
as
to
this
case,
the
nature
of
the
communist
party
was
not
precluded
by
any
congressional
finding.
it
was
the
issue,
the
principal
issue
before
the
board
of
--
subversive
activities
board
and
before
this
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
court
of
appeals.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
229?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir,
the
definition.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right.
now,
what
--
what
did
you
ask
about
that,
your
honor?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
1954
act
was
nothing
to
do
with
this,
it's
important
to
know
that
and
--
and
the
definition
of
what
is
a
communist-action
organization
under
the
act
that
is
before
you
which
appears
on
page
229,
mr.
justice
reed.
it's
an
organization
in
the
united
states,
any
organization
in
the
united
states
other
than
the
diplomatic
representative
or
mission
of
a
foreign
government
which
is
substantially
directed,
dominated
or
controlled
by
the
foreign
government
or
foreign
organization
controlling
the
world
communist
movement
referred
to
in
the
other
section,
section
2
and
which
operates
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
such
world
communist
movement
as
referred
to
in
section
2
of
this
title
and
the
finding
of
the
board
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
this
petitioner
answers
to
that
description.
that
was
not
assumed.
that
was
the
thing
principally
to
--
to
be
proved.
now,
what
is
the
sanction
against
this
petitioner?
that
it
register.
i
say
it's
a
very
mild
requirement
if
any
faith
is
to
be
given
to
these
findings.
nothing
could
be
more
reasonable
that
an
organization
that
has
been
duly
in
--
in
an
orderly
way
shown
to
be
the
handmaiden
of
a
foreign
power
and
whose
objective
it
has
been
to
destroy
this
government.
nothing
could
be
more
mild
or
reasonable
than
to
say
that
such
an
organization
shall
at
least
register
and
make
disclosure
of
its
members
and
of
its
funds
and
that
--
though
it
isn't
silenced
even
now,
it
shall
at
least
tell
the
public
who's
speaking.
the
whole
idea
of
free
speech
is
that
it
ought
to
remain
free,
it
shouldn't
be
suppressed
because
we
believe
that
through
speech
the
truth
will
finally
prevail
and
that
the
nation
ought
not
to
suppress
it
because
we
have
faith
that
when
people
are
properly
informed
they
will
come
to
the
right
conclusion.
but
in
this
welter
of
discussion,
when
you
have
someone
speaking
as
the
secret
agent
of
a
foreign
government,
whose
purpose
it
is
to
subvert
this
government,
congress
has
a
right
to
say
that
one
who
has
been
proven
such
shall
at
least
label
its
contribution
to
the
public
discussions
so
that
people
could
know
how
to
evaluate
it
and
there
have
been
other
instances
of
registration.
it's
not
a
new
or
unusual
thing.
there's
the
lobbying
act
that
this
court
has
upheld.
there's
the
corrupt
practices
act
that
this
court
has
upheld.
the
new
york
anti-kkk
law
has
been
upheld
by
this
court.
second
class
mailing
privileges
can
be
enjoyed
only
after
there
is
a
full
registration
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
newspaper
and
yet
nobody
thinks
that
that
violates
the
first
amendment.
the
rationale
is
that
by
registration
people
will
be
informed
and
be
able
to
know
what
the
speech
really
means.
their
--
if
they
know
the
motivations,
if
they
know
the
source,
they
know
how
to
appraise
it.
and
in
the
light
of
our
knowledge
of
the
communist
movement
and
of
the
proven
objectives
of
this
organization,
congress
has
been
very
moderate,
so
far
as
the
organization
is
concerned,
in
requiring
only
this
registration.
now,
there's
been
talk
about
the
self-incrimination
provisions.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
this
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
so
far
--
this
act?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
in
the
future?
i
don't
know
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
two
types
of
organizations.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
communist-action
organizations
and
communist-front
organizations.
now,
these
gentlemen
have
argued
here
that
communist-action
organization
can
only
apply
to
them.
well,
the
legislation
doesn't
become
unconstitutional
because
it
can
apply
to
only
one
person
if
the
classification
is
a
small
one.
that
doesn't
make
it
irrational
and
it
doesn't
make
it
unfair
and
it
doesn't
make
it
unconstitutional.
they
can't
say,
"there's
nobody
else
that's
engaged
in
this
conspiracy
on
the
same
scale
as
we,
therefore,
you
can't
let
legislate
against
us."
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
it
doesn't
apply
to
business
organizations
because
business
organizations
are
not
engaged
in
this
conspiracy.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it
will
satisfy
the
board
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
as
to
what?
that
there
were
--
that
the
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
no,
no.
not
--
not
ideas
and
beliefs
and
not
in
some
vague
way
associated.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it
is
the
limitation
of
the
statute.
i'll
read
it
on
the
statute's
words.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
229,
sir?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
the
term
communist-action
organization
means
any
organization
in
the
united
states
other
than
a
diplomatic
representative
or
mission,
i'll
--
i'll
omit
the
--
the
exception,
which
is
one
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
substantially
directed
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
section
3,
paragraph
2.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
right.
i'll
read
--
i'll
read
the
whole
--
the
whole
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
section.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
term
organization
means
an
organization,
corporation,
company,
partnership,
association,
trust
foundation
or
fund
and
includes
a
group
of
persons
whether
or
not
incorporated
--
whether
or
not
incorporated
permanently
or
temporarily
associated
together
for
joint
action
on
any
subject
or
subjects.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
any
association,
there
weren't
associations
being
defined
there,
not
--
not
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it's
broad
enough
to
include
any
association
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
included
in
the
term
organization,
not
organization
subject
to
the
law,
you
must
read
the
rest.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
included
in
the
definition
of
organization
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
not
in
subjecting
into
the
law.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
repeat,
mr.
justice
black,
it
is
broad
enough
to
be
included
in
the
definition
of
an
organization
but
not
every
organization
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
is
under
the
terms
of
that
subjected
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
to
its
provisions.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
and
the
standards
prescribed
are
those
in
the
--
in
next
paragraph,
in
3,
in
the
--
right
below
that.
you
see
2,
your
honor,
speaks
of
the
definition
of
organization,
3
speaks
of
communist-action
organization.
when
it
comes
to
communist-action
organization,
it's
narrowed
to
--
and
limited
to
any
organization
in
the
united
states
which
is
substantially
directed
and
dominated
by
a
foreign
power
and
which
operates
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
that
world
power.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
know
anything
about
any
insurance
company,
and
i
--
i
--
with
great
respect,
i
don't
want
to
speculate
about
what
--
what
happens
to
an
insurance
company.
what's
the
evidence
about
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
the
insurance
company?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
if
the
communist
party,
the
world
communist
party
should
organize
an
insurance
company
in
this
country
and
under
the
guise
of
a
lawful
insurance
company
it
engages
in
sabotage,
in
subversion,
in
efforts
to
infiltrate
other
organizations
and
to
damage
this
country
at
the
behest
of
a
foreign
country,
that
insurance
company
would
be
liable.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
if
someone
is
indicted
for
not
registering?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
there's
just
more
than
propaganda
here.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
all
right.
if
you
make
it
broad
enough
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
organization?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
issue
would
be
whether
it
was
in
fact
such
an
organization
and
should
have
registered.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they'd
have
to
prove
that.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no
organization
is
required
to
register
until
the
board
has
so
determined.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
and
--
and
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
the
court.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
but
the
courts
here
have
a
power
of
review,
too.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
does
that
make
it
unconstitutional?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
now
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it
is
done
by
a
board
and
reviewed
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
now,
an
individual
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
an
individual
here
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
is
not
to
be
indicted.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
he
would
be
entitled
to
jury
trial
on
his
own
affiliation
with
that
condemned
organization.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
nature
of
the
organization?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
sir.
and,
your
honor,
i
want
to
face
that
frankly.
i
don't
think
it's
practical
or
necessary
under
the
constitution
to
do
that.
it's
simply
impossible
to
have
a
15-month
trial
on
this
side
issue
in
the
case
of
everybody
that's
going
to
be
proceeded
against.
you
don't
go
into
the
nature
of
the
communist
movement
all
over
again.
you
don't
have
to
prove
all
over
again
each
time
that
the
sun
rises
in
the
east.
you
do
have
to
prove
in
each
case
fully,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
connection
of
the
particular
defendant
with
the
movement
and
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
even
if
he's
been
connected
with
it,
if
he
wants
to
absolve
himself
of
these
burdens,
all
he
has
to
do
is
disaffiliate.
of
course
if
he
insists
that
he
still
wants
to
belong
to
it
then
he
has
to
suffer
the
sanctions.
but
he
has
an
opportunity
to
get
out
and
if
he's
going
to
be
prosecuted,
he
is
entitled
to
have
it
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
a
jury
that
he
had
knowing
affiliation
with
this
condemned
organization.
but
it
is
not
necessary
in
each
case,
of
each
individual
to
go
again
afresh
into
a
proof
of
the
nature
of
the
world
communist
movement
or
the
particular
organization
of
which
he
is
a
member.
that's
already
been
done
by
the
board.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
think
there's
any
provision
here
about
the
criminal
--
yes,
there
is
for
not
registering
in
the
board.
yes,
but
they're
within
--
where
there
would
be
no
obligation
on
the
insurance
company
to
register
until
the
board
had
acted
and
the
court
have
reviewed
it
and
found
that
by
preponderance
of
evidence
it
had
been
proven
that
they
were
of
a
character
in
the
case.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
think
that
these
cases
are
parallel
at
all.
this
is
not
an
insurance
company.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
this
is
not
an
insurance
company.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
can't
answer
for
every
case
in
the
past
nor
do
i
think
we
have
to
anticipate
cases
in
the
future.
this
court
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
is
--
is
it
your
honor's
position
that
adjudicating
an
organization,
as
communist
control
--
communist-action
organization,
can
only
be
done
through
a
jury?
i
don't
know
of
anything
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
in
the
constitution
that
says
that.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
my
idea
too.
i
assent
to
that
fully.
no
person
can
be
deprived
of
his
property.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no
person
is
being
deprived
of
his
liberty
except
by
a
jury
trial.
he'd
have
to
be
indicted
that
he
could
pray
a
jury
trial.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
am
saying,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
know
but
--
but
the
--
i
--
the
hell
passage
is
dangerous
too.
i
want
--
i
want
to
steer
--
i
want
to
steer
between
scylla
and
charybdis.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
my
position
is
that
you
don't
have
a
constitutional
requirement
nor
would
it
be
practical
or
necessary
to
prove
all
over
again
the
nature
of
the
party
in
each
case.
but
the
individual,
who's
being
accused
of
having
committed
a
crime
in
not
registering
because
he's
a
member,
would
have
the
right
to
submit
to
a
jury.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
his
membership
and
his
knowledge.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
--
i
think
that
--
that's
correct
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
but
it
isn't
this
case.
this
isn't
case.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i'll
say
to
you
that
under
the
opa
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
all
right,
sir.
i
understand
your
honor
to
say
that
our
instances
where
findings
of
boards
can
be
made
conclusive
and
not
be
re-litigated
in
the
criminal
prosecution
that
follows.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
no,
though
i
understand
the
opa
is
an
illustration,
maximum
prices
are
fixed
by
the
board.
a
man
who
violates
those
maximum
prices
doesn't
have
the
opportunity
to
re-litigate
the
correctness
of
the
board's
findings.
but
anything
that
pertains
to
his
guilty
knowledge,
anything
that
pertains
to
his
own
offense,
that
can
be
litigated.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
think
it's
in
the
same
legal
position.
i
think
it
is.
i
think
it's
precisely
their
the
same
thing.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
i
--
i'm
almost
glad
to
get
help
when
i
need
it.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
this
question
of
self-incrimination.
there
are
several
answers
to
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
here
this
morning.
in
the
first
place,
the
issue
was
premature.
if
there's
anything
that's
been
settled
conclusively
with
regard
to
the
claim
of
immunity
under
the
fifth
amendment,
it
is
that
it
does
not
apply
to
an
organization.
it
only
can
apply
to
an
individual.
there's
no
individual
before
the
court
asserting
any
such
right
and
it
applies
only
to
natural
individuals
who
explicitly
claim
that
right,
that
immunity.
this
court
can't
assume
it
will
be
claimed.
now,
if
mr.
dennis
were
to
claim
that
he's
entitled
to
immunity
from
answering
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
party
and
that's
what
they
say
is
really
required
of
him
when
he
is
asked
to
register
for
the
party.
here
is
a
man
who
has
testified
again
and
again
or
was
said
in
public
again
and
again
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
party.
it's
never
been
denied.
this
court
or
no
court
would
automatically
grant
him
his
immunity
because
as
this
court
recently
pointed
out
with
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
judge
before
whom
that
claim
is
made
has
to
appraise
the
genuineness
of
the
claim.
if
it
is
really
asserted
in
order
to
prevent
the
incrimination
if
there's
real
danger,
he
is
entitled
to
that
immunity.
if
he's
asserting
it
merely
to
--
as
a
cover-up
for
others,
he's
not
entitled
to
it.
if
a
man
has
really
admitted
it
again
and
again
and
he's
in
no
jeopardy
by
reason
of
this
question,
he
would
be
denied
that.
it
would
depend
on
all
the
circumstances
which
would
have
to
be
developed
in
a
record.
that
record
is
not
here.
you're
not
dealing
with
an
individual.
you're
dealing
with
an
organization.
an
organization
cannot
make
that
--
assert
that
claim
against
self-incrimination
and
even
as
an
individual
it
depends
on
who
the
individual
is
and
what
he
is
asserting.
if
you
asked
patricia
blau
about
her
membership
in
an
organization,
she
is
entitled
to
stand
mute
and
say,
"no,
i
won't
--
i
won't
incriminate
myself,‚Äù
or
joe
blow
but
when
you
ask
eugene
dennis
or
william
z.
foster
to
register
and
he
says,
"that
will
incriminate
me,"
a
judge
would
have
to
examine
and
pass
on
whether
or
not
that
really
would
incriminate
him.
we
don't
have
to
determine
that
today.
that's
not
the
issue.
you
have
--
don't
have
that
defense
--
that
party
here.
you
only
have
the
communist
party
here
and
it
is
not
in
a
position
as
an
organization
to
raise
that
personal
immunity.
now,
they
say
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
raise
it.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it
might
or
it
might
not
be
so,
it
depends
on
the
circumstances.
now,
let
me
illustrate
right
here.
suppose
mr.
dennis
who
has
been
convicted
of
that
offense
were
to
raise
it,
the
person
has
already
been
convicted
and
punished
for
that
offense,
may
be
in
no
position
to
raise
a
claim
of
immunity
because
he's
not
in
jeopardy.
he
might
be.
i
don't
know.
it
would
have
to
be
inquired
into.
the
judge
would
have
to
pass
on
it
after
inquiry.
this
court
can't
--
can't
foresee
just
how
it
will
arrive.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
he'd
be
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
you
--
you're
assuming
that
it
is
not
known
that
he's
a
member
of
the
party
or
that
he
is?
i
didn't
quite
understand.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it
wasn't
known.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
would
--
i
would
concede
that
the
immunity
granted
in
this
statute
is
not
as
broad
as
the
danger
might
be
in
some
cases.
but
i
don't
think
this
court
can
assume
that
the
danger
to
these
officers
is
greater
than
the
immunity
that
the
statute
grants.
you'll
have
to
wait
to
see
until
the
question
was
properly
before
the
court.
normally,
a
person
who
is
not
known
as
a
communist
and
who's
asked
to
register
could
claim
the
immunity.
and
even
these
men
if
they
really
want
to
claim
the
immunity
someone
could
say,
"i'm
an
officer
of
an
organization.
i'm
an
officer
of
an
organization
that's
been
required
to
register,
but
i
--
that
would
involve
disclosing
my
identity
as
a
member
of
the
organization.
i
claim
my
immunity.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
will
not
file
it
for
that
reason.
i
claim
my
immunity."
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it
was
the
basis
for
it
that
you
--
he
would
have
asserted
it
properly.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
he
would
not
have
to
file
it.
he
would
say
to
the
attorney
general,
"i
am
entitled
to
an
immunity.
i
--
i
raise
that
claim
now
and
therefore
i
return
to
blank
or
i
will
not
--
i
will
not
file
it.‚Äù
then
the
question
would
arise
if
they
tried
to
compel
him
as
to
whether
he
was
really
compellable
or
was
entitled
to
the
immunity.
but
that
would
depend
on
a
variety
of
conditions
that
might
pertain
to
his
particular
situation.
some
people
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
it,
others
might
not
be.
i
think
it's
much
more
dubious
in
the
case
of
these
people
who
have
been
publicly
appearing
in
madison
square
garden
making
speeches
as
officers
of
the
communist
party.
i
don't
think
you
can
off
hand
and
before
the
record
is
here
say
that
such
a
person
will
be
really
jeopardized
than
incriminated
by
a
disclosure.
i
think
that
this
court
would
rather
have
that
question
arise
on
a
record.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
--
the
sanctions
really
apply
to
the
board
--
i
mean
to
the
organization
as
soon
as
the
organization
is
finally
ordered
that
is
after
a
court
approval
or
when
they
do
register.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they
have
to
--
what
--
what
page
is
that?
they
are
immediately
required
after
--
235?
wait
a
moment
that
isn't
the
section.
oh
--
where's
that?
yes,
here
is
the
list.
the
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
first
of
all
--
where
--
what
section
is
the
labeling
provision?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
they're
subject
to
a
fine.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
think
it
is
section
15
has
the
--
has
the
penalty.
page
2
--
262,
the
penalties.
if
there's
in
effect
with
respective
to
any
organization
or
individual
a
final
order
of
the
board
requiring
registration
under
section
7
or
section
8.
such
registration
shall
--
such
organization
shall
upon
conviction
of
failing
to
register
to
file
any
registration
statement
or
annual
report
or
to
keep
records
as
required
by
section
7
or
required
to
keep
records
be
punished
for
each
such
offense
by
a
fine
of
not
more
than
$10,000.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
separate
proceeding,
criminal
proceeding,
i
suppose.
i
guess
that's
--
i'm
sure
that's
the
only
way
that
could
be
done.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
they'd
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
as
to
whether
they
had
failed
to
register
or
had
any
excuse.
i
don't
know
what
defense
they
might
make
but
at
any
rate
there
would
have
to
be
this
proceeding.
nobody
comes
in
levy
as
the
$10,000
without
due
process.
and
then
of
course
there
are
provisions
here
about
the
individuals.
page
262.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
and
of
course
on
to
question
as
to
whether
--
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
individual
himself
would
have
the
right
to
claim
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it's
--
the
name
outlawry
of
course
it's
sort
of
an
epitaph.
i
--
i
don't
know
what
they
mean
by
that.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
think
they
could.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they
didn't.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they
didn't.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they
didn't
because
they
require
it
to
be
established
by
the
board
subject
to
judicial
review
which
has
been
had,
showing
that
they
have
violated
this
law.
now,
this
is
not
the
1945
--
1954
act
thus
named
the
communist
party
and
say
what
it
is
and
it
practically
--
it
does
outlaw
it
in
every
practical
sense.
but
this
proceeding,
it
was
not
under
that
act.
this
proceeding
is
under
the
1950
statute
which
puts
in
issue
and
requires
proof
as
to
the
nature
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
and
the
party
well
may
disintegrate
and
if
it
is
of
the
character
that
congress
has
--
it
is
of
the
character
that
congress
has
prescribed
as
a
definition
and
if
it
is
what
the
board
and
the
court
on
review
and
after
affirmance
by
this
court,
if
it
is
of
that
character
that
it
is
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
subvert
this
nation
that
may
well
happen
and
should.
and
yet
the
statute
doesn't
absolutely
compel
its
disintegration.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
not
necessarily.
but
if
it
should
--
if
it
should
happen,
i
don't
know
that
any
constitutional
violation
has
taken
place.
what
is
there
that
gives
anybody
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
a
conspiracy
against
the
government?
this
is
not
a
pre-speech
case.
it's
true
you
know
that
they
have
some
of
the
characteristics
of
a
political
party
but
you're
not
dealing
here
with
a
political
party.
they
say
that
--
that
because
we
have
slogans
and
we
--
we
talk
politics
that
we're
therefore
immune.
you're
not
immune
from
--
from
laws
against
--
against
subversion.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
one
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
this
--
this
organization,
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
is
permitted
by
this
law
to
change
its
character
to
truly
and
sincerely,
genuinely
disaffiliate
and
the
sanctions
would
have
to
be
lifted.
there's
provision
for
them
annually
if
they
wish
it
to
seek
a
review.
now,
if
they're
going
to
be
disintegrated
because
they
persist
in
this
conspiracy,
i
don't
know
that
any
constitutional
right
has
been
violated.
if
they
want
to
affect
their
real
and
not
a
spurious
disaffiliation,
the
statute
makes
provision
for
them
to
do
it.
now,
all
that
is
happening
in
the
meantime
is
that
this
party
has
to
label
its
propaganda
so
that
people
can
determine
what
it
is.
now,
you're
not
dealing
--
if
they're
going
to
be
a
political
party
and
nothing
more,
they
can
change
their
character.
the
law
doesn't
condemn
them
beaten
forever.
but
as
long
as
it
is
a
conspiracy,
as
long
as
that
has
been
in
an
orderly
and
--
and
proper
manner
to
determine,
they
have
to
wear
a
label
under
the
disability
that
the
law
imposes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
but
the
things
are
so
interrelated
that
you
can
--
what
legal
activity
can
they
have?
the
finding
is
that
all
of
their
activities
are
in
meshed
and
that
they
are
a
cover-up
for
a
criminal
conspiracy,
for
a
conspiracy
for
the
--
the
destruction
of
the
government.
now,
after
all,
many
criminal
acts
are
in
a
nature
of
verbal
acts.
if
several
people
get
together
to
rob
a
jewelry
store,
some
of
them
may
do
know
more
than
talk.
that's
not
free
speech,
that's
not
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
but
if
they
really
want
to
associate
for
a
legitimate
purpose
and
bring
chess
players
to
this
country
and
change
their
character,
they
can
do
that
at
anytime
under
the
--
under
the
provision
of
this
law.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
if
--
but
what
lawful
activity
are
they
operating?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
no,
but
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
but
in
this
case.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
in
this
case.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
in
this
case
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
what
lawful
activity
are
they
engaged
in?
the
very
thing
that
they
say
is
protected.
their
speeches
are
at
part
of
the
very
conspiracy
that
is
the
object
of
their
existence
and
it
is
a
part
of
a
worldwide
conspiracy
directed
by
a
foreign
government
such
as
the
finding.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
now,
if
you
assume
that,
what
is
left
for
them
to
protect?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
i
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
i
wouldn't
if
there
was
--
if
there
was
a
possibility
that
they're
operating
a
cattle
ranch
legitimately,
they'd
be
entitled
to
do
that.
but
suppose
--
what's
the
name
of
this
--
of
this
man
who
was
quite
notorious
a
few
years
ago?
a
--
a
holdup
man,
a
gangster
and
he
was
convicted
of
many
crimes,
suppose
he
were
to
get
up
and
say,
"i
am
--
i'm
the
president
of
an
organization
of
--
of
highway
money
and
i
don't
want
to
register
in
the
organization
because
to
do
so
would
break
up
the
organization."
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they
don't
want
to
register.
they
don't
want
to
register
but
they
--
but
the
law
has
been
upheld.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
this
statute,
your
honor
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
this
statute
does
not
proscribe
innocent
activities
and
if
they
want
to
engage
in
any
innocent
activity
unrelated
to
the
conspiracy,
they
can
genuinely
disavow
the
conspiracy.
they
have
--
they
have
said
in
this
testimony
that
they
have
not
changed
their
practices,
but
they
can
change
those
practices
and
say
we
want
from
now
on
having
cut
loose
from
this
conspiracy,
we
want
to
engage
in
political
propaganda.
we
want
to
talk
for
unemployment
insurance
and
for
--
and
against
racial
discrimination
and
for
other
things
that
they
sometimes
favor
along
with
good
people,
they
--
they
could
get
themselves
out
from
under
this
law.
there
is
provision
in
the
law
for
that.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
not
in
this
act.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
in
this
act,
they
require
to
find
preponderance
of
evidence
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
not
merely
the
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
if
you
read
the
judge
prettyman's
opinion,
you'll
see
that
he
goes
pretty
far.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
think
that's
--
that's
what
you've
got
to
balance
and
weigh
here,
but
i
want
to
point
out
too
that
one
of
the
factors
in
--
in
considering
whether
what
is
done
here
is
fair,
i
mean
whether
that
procedure
is
fair
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
that
the
statute
--
no
--
no,
i
mean
what
congress
did
here
--
what
congress
did
here
what
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right,
what
congress
authorized
is
fair
is
this
very
case
where
the
testimony
took
15
months.
will
it
be
practical,
would
it
be
more
satisfactory,
would
it
be
more
protective
of
the
rights
of
those
affected
and
have
to
attempt
to
present
an
issue
as
broad
as
that
before
a
jury?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
if
you
will
read
that
record
and
see
what
testimony
they
took
and
the
--
the
volume
of
it
and
i
don't
mean
volume
by
weight
but
being
the
--
the
range
of
it,
you'll
see
it
wasn't
falderal.
they
weren't
just
going
through
a
lot
of
gestures.
i
want
to
say
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
the
assumption
in
the
question
is
that
this
law
proscribes
activities.
it
doesn't
proscribe
anything.
it
merely
says
that
they
must
label,
they
must
register.
it
doesn't
undertake
to
prohibit
anything.
now
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
true.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
true.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
any
man
who
wants
a
passport
and
he
wants
to
engage
in
governmental
work
or
be
relieved
of
the
personal
sanctions
can
get
out
of
the
organization.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
he
can
--
he
can
get
out
of
the
organization.
now,
if
you
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
if
the
organization
is
the
character
of
organization
that
has
been
--
it
has
been
found
to
be,
what
right
have
they
to
remain
in?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
what
--
what
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
what
right,
what
real
right
is
being
destroyed?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
if
the
organization
has
been
outlawed
or
found
to
answer
this
description
and
he
persists
in
being
a
member
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
would
your
honor
think
that
it
--
it's
reasonable
to
require
that
in
each
application
for
a
passport,
if
a
man
has
shown
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
they've
got
to
go
all
over
again
proving
--
proving
the
nature
of
the
communist
party?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
if
he
is
listed
as
a
member
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
and
persistent
in
remaining
in
as
a
member,
he's
given
time
to
get
out.
he's
given
a
locus
poenitentiae
under
the
statute.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
men
have
often
have
been
seriously
damaged
because
they
guessed
wrong
on
their
lawyers.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
up
to
him.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right
--
that's
right
as
long
as
he's
a
member
of
the
organization.
he
can
get
out.
the
organization
can
purge
itself
then
could
change
its
character.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
you
don't
have
to
pass
on
any
of
these
questions,
all
that
this
statute
--
all
that
this
case
brings
before
you
is
the
validity
of
the
registration
features.
you're
not
required
by
this
record
to
go
into
all
the
possible
cases
that
may
arise
of
individuals
or
front
organizations.
many
considerations
that
apply
here
may
not
apply
to
organizations
of
a
different
character.
well,
the
--
the
relationship
to
this
conspiracy
is
--
is
tenuous
where
there's
a
possibility
that
people
who
belonged
who
didn't
know
the
nature
of
the
movement.
you
don't
have
that
here,
you
have
the
communist
party,
this
is
it.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
know,
they
--
they
say
that
they're
the
only
ones,
that
they
claim
an
exemption
because
they're
preeminent
in
this
--
in
this
movement.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
all
right.
well,
if
you
have
people
that
are
pure
of
heart
who
are
brought
here
and
you
feel
that
they
are
being
violated,
you'll
protect
them.
but
here's
an
organization,
they're
no
individuals,
the
organization
that
is
designed
--
i
forgot
in
which
opinion
i
read
this,
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
designed
not
as
a
political
party
but
design
as
a
part
a
conspiracy
to
further
a
foreign
conspiracy.
if
you
have
that
kind
of
an
organization,
pass
on
that
case
and
don't
--
let's
try
in
this
case,
on
this
record
to
adjudicate
cases
that
may
arise
in
the
future
under
an
entirely
different
facts.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
congress
has
tried
to
do
that
in
the
1954
act
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
effectively
to
abolish
them
because
they
--
they
outlaw
them,
they
take
away
all
their
rights.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
a
congressional
determination.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
here
defending
that
today.
i
mean
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
--
that
particular
part
i
don't
know
why
not,
they've
had
--
they've
had
full
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
it's
determined
that
they
are
conspirators.
i
don't
know
what
exemptions
they
are
entitled
to.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
mean
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
i
say
i
don't
know,
i
haven't
thought
of
that,
about
that
because
that's
not
this
case
but
that
goes
much
further
than
--
than
this
statute
goes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
but
it
--
it
isn't
--
it
just
isn't
so.
you're
not
--
i
say
with
great
respect,
you're
not
to
pass
on
questions
that
aren't
before
you,
they
haven't
arisen.
you
may
see
to
think
an
entirely
different
life
if
it's
presented
by
(a)
who
is
on
a
certain
situation
and
from
what
you'd
say
if
it's
presented
by
(b)
an
entirely
different
situation.
one
may
have
knowledge.
the
other
may
not
have
knowledge.
here
you're
not
--
you're
not
dealing
with
that
kind
of
a
situation.
this
is
not
some
--
some
person
who
is
being
condemned
out
of
his
hearing.
this
is
not
a
case
where
like
in
--
in
the
bailey
case
which
is
mentioned
here
this
morning
whether
--
neither
the
organization
nor
the
individual
was
given
any
hearing,
any
proper
hearing
and
the
opinion
of
--
of
some
people.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
exactly.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
--
that's
all
--
that's
all.
i
think
if
you
look
over
the
--
this
criteria
that
they
speak
of,
the
inferences
that
were
drawn,
the
definition
is
in
this
section
3
that
was
right
here.
the
13
(e)
are
merely
a
list
of
things
that
congress
says
the
board
may
consider.
it
doesn't
substitute
them
for
the
definition.
i
think
the
evidence
is
--
is
ample
and
if
you
harbor
any
doubts
as
to
the
validity
of
some
parts
of
the
statute
or
its
possible
application
in
cases
in
the
future,
that
in
determining
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
of
congress
is
no
reason
for
striking
the
act
down.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
think
so,
you
don't
--
there
--
there
are
many,
many
things
that
may
be
determined
without
a
jury.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
in
a
criminal
case
it
would
be
a
different
thing.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it's
just
this
labeling
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
and
registration.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
oh,
yes,
this
wasn't
done
to
make
the
communist
party
comfortable.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they
--
i
think
they
have
had
ample
due
process.
i
think
they
have
had
a
very
careful
and
conscientious
examination.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
sir?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
think
they
have
had
both.
i
think
they
have
had
both
and
they
can
always
--
if
they
really
want
to
change
their
character,
the
statute
gives
them
an
open
door
(inaudible)
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
but
they
have
a
perfect
right
--
they
have
a
perfect
right
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
to
move
very
quickly.
no,
but
the
party
itself
if
it
is
an
innocent
boy
scout
movement,
it
can
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
it
can
convert
itself
to
that.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
if
you
have
such
a
person
--
if
you
have
such
a
person,
you
will
find
him
not
guilty
if
--
if
he's
accused.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
but
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
mr.
justice,
if
a
man
is
working
in
the
defense
plant
and
he's
told,
"you're
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
it
has
been
adjudicated
a
conspiracy."
and
he
says,
"i
insist
however
on
belonging
to
it."
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
they're
consequences
he
--
he
brings
on
himself,
he
insists
on
it.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
even
penalties,
let's
call
them
penalties.
let's
even
call
them
penalties
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it's
something
that
he
doesn't
have
to
suffer.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
when
he
gets
out
of
a
party,
he
can
get
out
of
country
and
if
--
if
they
--
if
they
still
withhold
the
--
the
passport
from
him,
he
can
go
to
court
and
there
have
been
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
cases
of
that
sort.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
all
right.
i
--
i'm
not
here
to
defend
every
act
of
congress
as
wise
and
i
don't
think
i
have
to
lecture
that
subject
to
this
court
or
--
or
to
the
member
who
is
addressing
this
question
to
me.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no.
[laughter]
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it's
a
necessary
--
a
necessary
test.
now,
the
douds
case
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
congress
may
say
to
a
man,
"if
you
want
to
be
an
officer
of
a
union,
you've
got
to
resign
from
the
communist
party."
the
douds
case
decided
that.
now,
if
you
can
say
to
a
man,
"you
can't
be
an
officer
of
a
union
if
you're
a
member
of
the
communist
party."
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
then
they
are
stripped
of
their
--
of
certain
rights.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
they
are
stripped
of
certain
rights
just
as
this
party
here
in
--
in
this
case.
so
after
all,
this
is
no
child's
play,
the
--
the
congress
has
a
right
to
--
to
put
some
teeth
in
this
law
but
it
isn't
an
irrational,
it
isn't
a
savage
thing
to
do
and
if
you
give
them
a
full
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
you
determined
the
nature
of
the
organization
and
you
give
them
an
opportunity
periodically,
if
they
really
sincerely
can
show
that
they
have
changed,
they
can
--
they
can
be
relieved
of
the
consequences.
if
on
the
other
hand,
they
persist
then
they
can't
say
were
--
we're
being
denied
rights.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
true.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
but
in
--
in
this
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
but
it
--
there's
this
difference.
in
the
case
of
the
lobbyist,
all
in
--
he
is
doing
is
disclosing
his
activities,
it's
not
inherently
an
unlawful
activity.
here,
these
people
have
been
shown
to
be
engaged
in
unlawful
activity
and
i
think
that
--
that
makes
a
big
difference.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
he
can
show
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
if
--
if
on
his
trial,
he
is
one
--
that
he
can
show
or
convince
the
--
the
court,
the
jury
that
he's
one
of
those
innocents
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
spoke
of,
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
he
can't
say.
he
can't
say
that
the
--
that
i'm
going
to
re-litigate
the
character
of
the
organization.
but
if
his
lawyers
can
convince
the
jury
that
he
is
really
an
innocent,
that
he
did
not
understand
the
character
of
the
organization
then
he
would
be
found
not
guilty.
that
much
would
be
open
to
him,
not
the
character
of
the
organization
but
the
character
of
his
connection
with
the
organization.
i
think
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
whether
he
had
failed
to
register.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
now
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
but
you've
got
--
you've
got
a
double
thing
here.
you've
got
not
merely
his
failure,
you've
got
the
problem
of
the
character
of
the
organization.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
all
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
but,
your
honor,
the
assumption
here
is
that
there
is
really
a
legitimate
work
that
they
are
doing,
cattle
raising.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
suppose
it
were
--
may
i
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
i
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
activity.
this
is
not
merely
a
business
that
can
have
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
congress
has
prescribed
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
--
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
activity
that
it
wants
to
forbid.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
and
it
comes
down
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
they
couldn't
do
that.
they
couldn't
do
that,
but
i
don't
know
of
anything
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
a
thing
of
this
sort
cannot
be
determined
by
a
board.
the
opa,
example,
is
--
is
one
example
and
draft
boards
frequently
determine
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
whether
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
everybody
alike
--
unfortunately,
there
aren't
many
communist
parties.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
but
it
limits
them
to
a
foreign
--
an
organization
dominated
by
a
foreign
power
and
owing
allegiance
to
them
and
furthering
their
work.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
they
do
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
trial
by
a
jury
of
any
individual
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
is
--
is
still
here.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
in
--
in
this
--
in
this
law,
all
that
is
determined
by
the
board
is
the
nature
of
the
communist
party.
so
far
as
individuals
are
concerned,
they
have
the
right
of
a
trial
by
a
jury
on
all
other
issues.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
one
issue
is
foreclosed.
i
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
not
because
--
not
because
they
are
communists
but
because
they
are
conspirators
against
the
government.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
see
how
you
could
re-litigate
this
question
as
a
practical
matter
in
--
in
the
case
of
each
individual.
you've
got
to
--
there
--
there
are
many
instances
in
the
law
where
you
have
a
representative
action
and
the
issue
is
litigated
fully
and
other
people
are
bound
by
what
they
--
what
is
there
to
determine
as
to
that
issue.
