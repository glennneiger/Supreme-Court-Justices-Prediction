mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
by
that
--
by
that
same
argument,
what
would
happen
to
an
officer
of
--
of
this
party
who
did
register
for
the
party
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
then
was
charged
under
the
smith
act
and
he
raised
the
issue
of
self-incrimination
on
his
trial,
if
there
was
any
way
for
him
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
raise
it,
would
you
then
say
that
because
he
had
admitted
it
frankly
and
freely
and
openly
in
this
legislation
that
he
could
not
raise
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
take
the
--
just
take
those
bare
facts
that
--
that
i
mentioned.
supposed
it
wasn't
generally
known
to
the
--
to
the
public
but
under
this
registration
act,
he
registered
and
then
he
was
prosecuted
under
the
smith
act.
would
that
registration
come
under
the
--
the
principle
you
just
established
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
if
--
if
it
was
known
generally
and
publicly
that
he
was
--
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
that
he
could
no
longer
claim
his
privilege?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
let's
assume
that
it
wasn't
known
until
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
until
he
--
until
he
made
his
affidavit
and
made
it
a
public
record
to
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
suppose
all
of
these
--
this
act
was
designed
to
have
register
those
people
who
were
not
known
publicly,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
--
if
they
have
both
legal
and
illegal
activities,
they
are
deprived
by
this
act
of
their
legal
activities
as
well?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
though
if
a
group
of
cattlemen
were
--
were
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
of
cattle
stealing,
you
couldn't
require
them
to
register
in
such
a
manner
that
they
could
not
operate
their
cattle
ranches
lawfully,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they're
--
they're
operating
their
cattle
ranches
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
this
side
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
maybe
they're
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
steal
cattle.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
owning
a
cattle
ranch
in
the
neighborhood
where
they
might
steal
the
cattle,
who
might
also
be
an
assistance
to
them
in
their
conspiracy
but
you
wouldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
wouldn't
prohibit
them
from
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
about
that
is
of
course
i
think
you
can
make
a
gambler
register
and
i
think
you
might
make
other
people
register
too
but
--
but
can
you
proscribe
the
innocent
and
legal
activities
as
well
as
the
illegal
one,
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
thing
that
bothers
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
only
--
the
only
trouble
with
that,
general,
is
that
there
are
some
sanctions
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
involved
if
they
register,
they
can't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
get
a
passport,
they
can't
engage
in
--
in
governmental
work
or
defense
work
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
dealing
with
those
people
who
were
--
who
were
in
and
who
were
subject
to
the
sanctions
of
the
act,
i
think
when
we
--
when
we
determine
what
the
legal
effect
to
this
act
is
and
we
can't
say,
"well,
it's
a
very
easy
answer,
just
get
out."
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
questions
we'd
determine
whether
--
whether
they
have
the
right
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
do
it
in
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general,
in
this
case,
the
passport
is
not
only
denied
to
such
a
person
but
it's
made
a
criminal
offense
for
him
to
apply
for
one,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
there's
one
other
thing
that
--
that
concerned
me
when
--
when
you
cite
the
lobbyist
act
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
other
acts
of
that
character
as
being
analogous
to
--
to
this
one.
in
those
acts,
as
i
remember,
the
--
they
were
really
registration
acts
and
if
they
complied
with
the
law
and
registered,
there
were
no
sanctions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
this
case,
the
mere
registration
imposes
the
sanctions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
--
that
--
that
makes
the
distinction
now,
what
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
fact
is,
i
don't
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
i'd
like
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
a
question
was
raised
as
whether
--
whether
he
has
a
right
to
show
that
on
his
trial
or
whether
he
has
to
rely
on
the
finding
of
some
--
some
board
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
that
effect.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
that
be
available
to
him?
as
i
understood
it
--
i
understood
you
a
little
awhile
ago,
you
said
if
the
board
had
determined
that
the
organization
he
belonged
to
was
illegal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
was
conclusive
upon
him
and
that
when
he
was
prosecuted
for
--
for
not
registering,
it
wasn't
opened
to
him
just
to
say,
"well,
this
--
this
wasn't
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
kind
of
an
organization,
so
consequently
i
am
not
guilty."
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
