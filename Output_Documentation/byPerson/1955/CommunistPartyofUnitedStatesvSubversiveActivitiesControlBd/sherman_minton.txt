if

well,
of
course
the
registration
is
not
so
much
to
disclose
the
identity
of
the
individual
who
will
act
for
the
company
--
for
the
organization.
they're,
i
think,
pretty
well-known.
certainly
in
the
case
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
the
--
the
officers
are
well-known
--
known
to
this
court.
but
other
people
whose
names
--
a
list
of
members
would
be
disclosed,
information
about
their
propaganda
would
be
disclosed
and
of
course
the
labeling
and
the
other
sanctions
would
follow.
but
you
don't
have
an
individual
claiming
his
--
his
immunity.
it's
doubtful
whether
in
the
case
of
these
officers
the
immunity
can
validly
be
claimed.
i
don't
want
to
have
argue
that
they're
not
entitled
to
it
because
i
don't
know
what
circumstances
may
exist
and
this
court
can't
know.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
now
you
don't
have
any
individual.
there's
been
no
assertion.
you
can't
assume
there
will
be
an
assertion.
you
can't
assume
that
it's
asserted
that
it
ought
to
be
allowed.
all
you
know
is
that
the
organization
is
here
claiming
that
on
its
face
it's
invalid.
but
now,
they
can
comply
without
violating
--
it's
conceivable
that
they
can
apply
--
comply
without
violating
any
individual's
rights
or
that
individual's
rights
will
not
even
be
asserted
or
if
asserted
that
they
will
not
be
correctly
asserted.
and
the
assumption
of
their
argument
is
that
nobody
--
nobody
under
any
circumstances
can
be
--
have
to
file.
i
think
it's
an
assumption
that
the
court
ought
not
to
be
--
to
be
making
in
the
absence
of
--
of
a
record
of
facts.
