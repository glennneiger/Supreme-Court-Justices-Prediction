may
i
interrupt
to
ask
whether
--
justice
felix

--
the
implication
of
your

was
that
congress
couldn't
pass
an
outlawry
statute
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
--
couldn't

could
not
pass

not?

that
mean?

did
not
answer

all
right,

are
coming
to
it.
justice

that
is

is
that
an
outlawry
of
the
party

not?
what
do
i
--
justice

is
that
involved
in
this

justice

suppose
the
australian

were
to
deal
with
simply

with
different
provisions
of
a
very
different
constitution
for
this
problem?
justice

it
doesn't

it
doesn't
operate

justice

how
long

what

a

may

whether
in

definition
of
the

--
justice

(inaudible)
mean
ii,
roman
ii,
that
it
operates
primarily
to
advance
the
objective
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
such
world
communist
movement
objective.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
does
that
mean
that
the
statute
entitles
the
accused
party
or
any
of
communist-action
organizations
to
a
hearing
whether
it
does
believe
in
accomplishing
--
in
achieving
that
objective
by
force
or
violence
and
put
that
issue
of
the
means
by
which
this
world
objective
is
to
be
accomplished
to
--
initially
to
prove
or
is
the
right
to
a
hearing
foreclosed
by
legislative
predetermination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
and
if
accused,
communist-action
organization
is
barred
from
saying,
"we
do
not
believe
in
accomplishing
that
movement
by
force
and
violence."
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know,
is
that
an
issuable
claim
or
does
the
--
or
does
the
statute
itself
conclude
legislatively?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
their
belief
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
their
belief
--
their
belief
for
discipline
that
this
communist
--
that
the
objective
of
that
movement
has
to
be
obtained
by
force
and
violence.
my
answer
is
on
belief
enough
in
advance
in
accomplishing
the
objective
with
force
and
violence,
is
that
issue
a
perishable
issue
to
be
determined
by
evidence
such
as
they
may
have
used
or
had
congress
foreclosed
that
issue
by
its
determination,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
it
was
before
the
board,
what
i
want
to
know,
could
the
board
have
said
the
statute
has
foreclosed
that
issue
and
it's
not
for
us
to
listen
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
communist
party
doesn't
believe
in
force
and
violence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
as
you
stand
there
now,
thank
you
for
listening,
you
say
that
under
the
statute
the
belief
or
disbelief
by
an
accused
organization
that
the
communist
--
the
act
of
communist-action
organization,
its
belief
or
disbelief
that
deems
--
and
that
it
will
be
accomplished
by
force
and
violence
is
a
--
is
a
purpose
or
relevance,
an
allowable
issue
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
well
be
but
if
i
have
to
construe
the
statute,
i
have
to
know
whether
there
was
a
legislative
prejudgment
of
that
issue
even
though
the
board
allowed
it
to
be
valid.

justice

oh,
i
just
wanted
to
make
clear
what
we
were
talking
about
here
--
justice
felix

--
the
1954
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix

this
court
has
decided
case
after
case
of
certain
practices
determined
by
the
administrative
agencies
and
the
violation
of
the
order
of
that
administrative

deprives
the

the

determined

is
not

justice

doesn't
help
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
did
we.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
face
it
up,
if
i
may
say
so,
this
--
my
brother
black
says.
he
isn't
taking
your
case
of
a
(inaudible)
of
an
organization
condemned
or
found
to
be
within
the
statute
by
the
board
and
then
an
individual
indicted
for
being
a
member
and
the
issue
could
arose
again.
he
isn't
taking
this
case
where
there
isn't
--
it
isn't
a
question
of
an
organization
of
expenditure
that
organization
itself
is
put
out
of
business,
it
may
be
operated
under
a
--
behind
the
far
side
that
even
an
organization
normally
engaging
in
business
and
the
question
that
i
think
you
have
to
meet
in
what
is
put
to
you
is
that
that
organization
have
been
found
by
the
board
to
come
within
the
statute,
it
is
then
possibly
for
failing
to
file
on
these
preferences
of
information
and
if
they
try
to
raise
all
over
again
the
question
whether
it
is
one
of
these
outlawed
and
proscribed
organization.
as
i
get
your
answer
it
is
but
he
--
it
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
raise
that
issue
de
novo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
may
be
but
as
i
understand
the
question
is
if
we
are
entitled,
who
isn't
the
person
who's
entitled,
but
the
constant
question
is
the
finding
of
guilt
all
separates
that
issue
as
part
of
the
thing
which
--
for
which
the
serious
document
is
followed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
just
(inaudible)
to
lead
my
interpretation
of
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
i
thought
(voice

--
justice
felix

--
and
i
also
looking
forward.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
thought
that
that
was
a
trojan
horse
that
i
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
feel
i
have
held
their
view
in
justice
black's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suggestion
is
not
that
you
renew
but
--
but
that's
the
fair
construction
of
some
of
the
constitutional
provisions
require
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
by
one
method
to
which
the
jury
and
the
court
rather
than
another
method
with
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
goes
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
power
of
congress
to
provide
this
congress
machinery
not
to
outlaw
this
kind
of
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
various
--
may
i
suggest
that
the
various
questions
as
i
understand
it
and
has
been
put
to
you
clearly
all
converge
to
a
comprehensive
problem
in
this
case
as
argued
here
and
i
say
that
because
i
assume
it
helps
counsel
to
know
(inaudible)
the
court
has,
at
least
one
has.
it
all
converges
to
this
central
problem
mainly,
what
procedure
may
congress
have
done
it
being
conceded
what
i
suppose
that
being
certainly
much
fairer.
but
if
it
left
all
these
that
could
define
the
offenses,
left
their
determination
to
the
conventional
fee
of
a
judge
--
of
a
jury
presided
over
by
a
judge,
there
won't
be
any
doubt
that
that
would
be
all
right
to
illustrate
what
seems
to
me
to
be
to
be
the
--
the
essential
difficulty
in
which
suppose
there
is
one,
whether
it's
the
problem
raised
by
this
case,
what
i
mean
by
difficulty
(inaudible)
this
court
has
held
that
--
that
if
someone
comes
in,
in
this
country,
a
board
may
decide
that
he
is
not
attributing
and
finds
that
he's
an
alien
and
he's
not
entitled
through
a
judicial
determination
of
that
power.
this
court
--
there's
no
--
you
need
to
apply
that
in
a
later
case
through
a
deportation
proceeding
which
citizenship
is
so
important,
we
wanted
to
have
a
safeguard
of
a
judicial
determination
because
on
the
whole
experience
shows
judicial
determination
of
plaintiff
security
best
likelihood
that's
going
along
with
the
administrative.
now,
the
suggestion
that
--
that
emerges
from
these
questions
and
your
answer
is
precisely
i
think
of
that
order
of
problems,
namely,
determination
would
be
made
for
all
practical
purposes
by
a
board
because
judicial
review
is
a
very
limited
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
can't
make
a
de
novo
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
sure
that
he
is
very
conscientious
in
going
over
the
record
(inaudible)
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
momentum
of
determination,
put
it
at
it
lowest,
is
what
the
board
has
found
and
the
question
is
whether
the
question
is
who
should
be
left
with
that
kind
of
administrative
determination
rather
than
be
left
to
a
jury
and
a
judge,
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
not
a
fair
--
broader
way
of
putting
what
is
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
congress
has
authorized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
suggest
that
the
15
months
was
falderal
because
they're
just
concerned
what
congress
has
determined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
member
of
this
organization
that
--
that
this
man
as
a
member
of
this
organization,
can
he
be
denied
a
passport
here
because
the
organization
has
been,
i'll
use
the
term,
outlawed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
says,
"oh,
i'm
one
of
these
--
the
world
is
full
of
very
nice
innocent
people
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say
i
don't
believe
this.
can
he
test
it
and
say,
"you
hold
up
denying
me
a
passport
until
i
can
prove
to
you
that
it
isn't
so
because
i
wasn't
before
the
board
when
this
determination
was
made
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
are
now
making
--
you're
now
depriving
me
of
the
right
to
see
my
mother
and
emilio
in
france
and
where
not,
although
i
contest
the
conclusion."
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
then
i
misunderstood
you
much
earlier
and
a
man
who
has
been
working
in
a
defense
plan,
he
can
be
tried
without
going
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
says
i've
got
a
very
good
lawyer
perhaps
as
skilled
as
though
through
a
defendant
or
i've
got
a
lawyer
who
got
a
different
strategy,
a
lawyer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
bearing
that
strategy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
maybe
they
wanted
to
be
outlawed,
that
suggestion
has
been
made,
they
like
to
be
modeled
by
the
business,
illegitimate
rather
than
legitimate.
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suggesting
that,
it's
my
belief,
but
i
have
heard
talk
like
that.
justice
felix

it
is
nice

reminded
on

says
i
got

who
can
prove
that
it
isn't
so.
justice

yes.
