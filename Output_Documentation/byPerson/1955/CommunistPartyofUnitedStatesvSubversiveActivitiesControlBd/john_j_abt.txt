mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
brings
here
for
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia,
judge
bazelon
dissenting,
which
affirmed
an
order
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
ordering
the
petitioner
to
register
as
a
communist
action
organization
under
section
7
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act.
the
order
of
the
board
was
issued
after
a
hearing
held
pursuant
to
the
act
and
was
accompanied
by
a
report
in
which
the
board
set
forth
its
findings
as
to
the
facts.
the
case
in
our
view
presents
questions
of
the
highest
public
importance
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
act,
and
also
as
to
the
act's
application
by
the
board
and
the
court
below.
the
act
was
passed
over
a
presidential
veto
in
september
of
1950
during
the
early
months
of
the
korean
war.
the
first
point
that
i
shall
argue
here
today
is
that
the
act,
on
its
face,
and
as
applied,
violates
the
first
amendment.
i
shall
show
that
under
the
guise
of
a
registration
statute,
the
act,
in
fact,
represents
an
attempt,
i
submit,
without
precedent
in
this
country
to
--
to
coerce
conformity
by
suppressing
advocacy,
association
and
collective
activity
for
wholly
legitimate
purposes.
the
act
provides
for
proceedings
before
the
board
to
be
initiated
upon
petitions
of
the
attorney
general,
to
determine
subject
to
judicial
review
whether
an
organization
is
a
communist
action,
a
communist
front,
or
a
communist
infiltrated
organization,
all
three
of
these
organizations
being
collectively
referred
to
as
communist
organizations.
a
communist
action
organization
is
defined
in
section
3
(3)
of
the
act
as
an
organization
which,
and
i
quote,
"(1)
is
substantially
directed,
dominated,
or
controlled
by
the
foreign
government
or
foreign
organization
controlling
the
world
communist
movement
referred
to
in
section
2
of
this
title,
and
(2)
operates
primarily
to
advance
the
objectives
of
such
world
communist
movement
as
referred
to
in
section
2
of
this
title."
section
2
finds
that
the
world
communist
movement
referred
to
in
this
definition
is
directed
and
controlled
by
a
foreign
power,
operates
through
the
medium
of
world
--
of
a
worldwide
communist
organization
composed
of
communist
action
organizations
in
the
various
countries.
and
has
as
its
purpose
the
establishment
of
communist
totalitarian
dictatorships
throughout
the
world
by
means
of
espionage,
sabotage,
terrorism,
treachery,
deceit,
infiltration,
and
any
other
means
deemed
necessary.
communist-front
and
the
communist
infiltrated
organizations
are
defined
by
the
act
in
terms
of
their
control
by
a
communist-action
organization
and
their
purpose
or
objective
of
effectuating
the
purposes
of
a
communist-action
organization.
communist
action
and
front
organizations
are
required
to
register
as
such
with
the
attorney
general
when
a
registration
order
issued
by
the
board
becomes
final
as
it
does
upon
the
exhaustion
of
judicial
review.
communist
infiltrated
organizations
are
not
required
to
register
but
are
deprived
of
the
benefits
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
registration
statement
of
a
communist-action
organization
must
list
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
of
the
officers
and
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
organization,
give
a
detailed
financial
accounting,
and
list
of
printing,
mimeographing
and
other
duplicating
equipment
in
the
possession
of
the
organization,
its
members
or
other
organizations
in
which
it
has
an
interest.
mr.
john
j.
abt
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
the
attorney
general
has
prepared
and
publicized
and
has
available
such
forms,
and
i'm,
if
the
court,
of
course,
may
take
judicial
notice
of
those
forms.
members
whose
names
are,
let
me
say
it
first,
the
registration
statements
are
open
for
public
inspection
and
they
must
also
be
kept
current
biannual
reports.
members
whose
names
are
not
listed
in
a
registration
statement
filed
by
the
organization
must
register
themselves
after
a
--
an
administrative
determination
of
their
membership
in
the
organization.
now,
in
view
of
the
definition
of
a
communist
action
organization
in
the
act,
it
is
clear
that
a
registration
order
requires
the
organization
to
stigmatize
itself
or
the
members
that
they
require
to
register
to
stigmatize
themselves
as
participants
in
a
foreign
controlled
seditious
conspiracy.
the
failure
of
the
officers
to
comply
with
this
requirement
by
registering
the
organization,
or
the
failure
of
the
members
to
register
themselves,
if
they
are
required
to
do
so,
is
punishable
by
five
years
imprisonment
and
a
$10,000
fine,
both
cumulative
for
each
day
that
the
failure
to
register
continues.
so
the
penalties
may
become
almost
astronomical.
a
final
registration
order
also
automatically
invokes
a
series
of
crippling
sanctions
against
both
the
organization
and
its
members.
all
of
these
sanctions,
it's
important
to
note
and
should
be
emphasized,
become
operative
whether
or
not
the
organization
registers
or
whether
or
not
the
members
register.
in
other
words,
compliance
relieves
neither
the
organization
nor
the
members
from
these
sanctions.
sanctions
are
the
following,
first,
the
organization
must
label
all
literature
and
publications
which
it
distributes
in
the
mails
or
through
interstate
commerce
identifying
them
as
disseminated
by
a
communist
organization.
its
broadcasts
and
telecasts
must
be
preceeded
by
a
similar
identifying
announcement.
this
requirement
of
self-stigmatization
applies
to
all
of
the
organizations,
publications
and
broadcasts
regardless
of
their
content.
second,
it
is
unlawful
for
members
of
the
organization
to
hold
non-elective
federal
office,
any
office,
whatsoever,
or
employment
in
any
labor
union
or
employment
of
any
kind
in
an
enterprise
which
has
been
listed
by
the
secretary
of
defense
as
a
defense
facility.
these
provisions
virtually
closed
the
door
to
all
employment
opportunities
for
the
members
of
a
condemned
organization.
third,
it
is
unlawful
for
the
members
to
apply
for
or
to
use
passports
for
any
purpose,
no
matter
how
innocent.
fourth,
it
is
unlawful
for
employees
of
the
government
or
a
defense
facility
to
contribute
funds
or
services
to
the
organization
irrespective
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
contribution
is
made.
and
finally,
naturalized
citizens
who
joined
the
organization
within
five
years
after
naturalization
are
subject
to
the
revocation
of
their
citizenship,
alien
members
are
to
be
excluded,
deported
and
are
ineligible
for
naturalization.
the
sanctions
with
reference
to
labeling
of
publications
in
literature
and
broadcasts,
employment,
passports,
and
contributions
are
all
enforceable
by
very
onerous
criminal
penalties.
in
addition,
it
is
important
to
note
that
all
of
the
sanctions
on
the
members
are
imposed
solely
because
of
their
membership
without
regard
to
their
personal
innocence
and
also
without
regard
to
their
lack
of
personal
knowledge
of
any
wrong
doing
by
the
organization.
sanctions
imposed
by
the
act
on
the
so-called
communist-front
organizations
and
their
members
differ
from
most
that
i
have
just
described
only
in
a
few
ameliorating
details.
moreover,
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
you
may
resign,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
has
been
a
mistake,
there's
a
lengthy
procedure
through
which
you
can
get
your
name
off
the
list,
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
the
petitioner,
the
sanctions
on
members
are
not
confined
to
persons
who
are
members
by
any
conventional
standards.
they
extend
instead
to
an
undefined
multitude
of
individuals
who
may
be
found
to
be
members,
and
i
used
to
put
that
term
in
quotes,
under
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act
which
establishes
such
vague
and
comprehensive
criteria
for
membership
in
the
communist
party
that
almost
anyone
can
be
found
to
be
a
member.
furthermore,
a
registration
order
has
consequences
beyond
those
i've
already
described.
any
person
who
signs
or
whose
name
was
listed
in
a
registration
statement
becomes
an
obvious
candidate
for
prosecution
under
the
smith
act
or
under
the
extravagantly
vague
provisions
of
section
4
(a)
of
this
act
which
denounce
a
conspiracy
and
i
quote,
"to
perform
any
act
which
would
substantially
contribute
to
the
establishment
of
a
totalitarian
dictatorship
under
foreign
control."
in
addition,
by
branding
the
organization
and
its
members
as
reasonable
conspirators,
the
registration
order
brings
down
upon
them
all
of
the
consequences
of
defamation
recently
characterized
by
mr.
john
lord
o'brian
as
historically
the
most
foul
of
all
weapons.
making
the
members
and
the
organization
social
outcasts
and
threatening
the
members
with
economic
restitution.
finally,
a
registration
order
makes
it
prohibitive
for
other
groups
and
individuals
to
associate
with
the
condemned
organization
and
its
members.
or
even
to
advocate
legitimate,
social
or
economic
views
which
the
latter
supports
or
an
addition
to
the
threat
posed
by
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act,
any
group
which
engages
in
such
association
or
advocacy
risks
condemnation
as
a
front
organization
or
infiltrated
organization
under
the
act's
evidentiary
criteria
for
organization
to
this
character.
thus,
the
registration
order
completely
quarantines
the
organization
and
its
members.
worst
than
that,
it
effectively
deters
the
whole
people
from
even
considering
let
alone
espousing
any
views
which
the
organization
advocates.
in
the
light
of
all
these
consequences
of
a
registration
order,
we
submit,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
it's
idle
to
pretend
as
the
respondent
here
does
that
this
act
is
a
civil
disclosure
statute.
no
legitimate
disclosure
statute
imposes
disrupted
penalties
on
those
who
comply
with
it,
nor
does
a
legitimate
disclosure
statute
expose
the
registrant
to
criminal
and
civil
liabilities
created
by
the
registration
statute
itself.
the
court
has
recognized,
or
did
recognize,
in
the
joint
anti-
fascist
refugee
case,
that
an
adverse
listing
by
the
attorney
general
unaccompanied
by
any
of
the
sanctions
contained
in
this
act
virtually
destroys
the
listed
organization.
in
the
context
of
the
provisions
and
penalties
of
this
act,
we
believe
it
clear
that
a
registration
order
is
tantamount
to
outlawry.
but
the
organization
registers
as
a
criminal
conspirator
that
destroys
itself.
mr.
john
j.
abt
surely.
mr.
john
j.
abt
could
not
pass
an
outlawry
statute?
i
don't
think
that
congress
can
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
coming
to
that,
sir.
i
would
say
that
it
could
not.
mr.
john
j.
abt
and
i
think
that
i
will
indicate
the
reasons
for
that
when
i
get
--
get
down
to
the
first
amendment
question.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
humphrey
amendment,
if
your
honor
has
that
in
mind,
would
have
penalized
membership
in
the
communist
party,
made
membership
in
the
communist
party
a
crime.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
not
coming
to
the
communist
control
act,
sir,
because
the
communist
control
act
isn't
--
isn't
before
the
court
except
in
section
5
before
i'll
come
to
the
question
of
outlawry.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
--
what
it
does
--
let
me
tell
you
what
it
does
and
then
we
can
--
characterization
is
an
important
--
and
the
communist
control
act
states
that
the
communist
party
is
hereby
deprived
of
all
rights,
privileges,
courted
to
any
organization
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
any
states,
something
to
that
effect,
that's
what
it
says.
there
has
been
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
particular
provision
of
the
control
act
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
no,
sir.
as
i
stated,
if
the
organization
registers
as
a
criminal
conspirator,
it
not
only
destroys
itself
but
it
jeopardizes
the
livelihood
and
the
liberty
of
its
members,
its
contributors,
and
even
those
with
whom
it
does
business
by
listing
their
names
for
public
scrutiny.
if
a
member
registers
as
a
criminal
conspirator,
he
destroys
himself.
hence,
the
act
makes
and
we
think
was
obviously
intended
to
make
registration
impossible.
on
the
other
hand,
non-registration
exposes
the
officers
and
members
to
astronomical
criminal
penalties
for
non-registration.
the
order
does
offers
a
hobson's
choice
between
suicide
by
registration
and
governmental
execution
for
non-registration.
far
from
accomplishing
disclosure,
the
act
compels
concealment,
the
only
sanctuary
left
to
the
organization
and
its
members.
the
registration
order
thus
results
not
in
information,
but
in
proscription.
its
function
is
to
outlaw
the
petitioner,
lay
a
foundation
for
the
mass
prosecution
of
its
members
and
establish
a
basis
for
proscribing
other
organizations
including
trade
unions
as
communist-front
or
communist
infiltrated.
in
the
light
of
this,
the
true
nature
of
the
act,
its
destruction
of
first
amendment
rights,
we
think,
becomes
obvious.
the
act
is
a
crass
infringement
of
the
principle
that
legislation
affecting
the
area
protected
by
the
first
amendment
must
be
narrowly
limited
to
some
substantive
evil
that
it
is
--
it
is
within
the
competence
of
the
congress
to
prevent.
the
(inaudible)
of
the
act
are
not
limited
to
the
seditious
and
criminal
activity
and
advocacy
described
in
section
2.
instead,
the
act
proscribes
organizations
as
a
whole
including
all
of
their
innocent
advocacy
and
activities.
thus,
in
this
case,
whatever
else
may
be
charged
against
the
petitioner,
it
concededly
employs
association
and
advocacy
for
legitimate,
political,
economic,
and
social
objectives,
many
of
which
are
shared
by
other
political
parties,
trade
unions
and
groups
but
the
act
supresses
all
of
these
legitimate
activity.
it
doesn't
do
so
as
an
incident
to
the
control
of
deleterious
or
injurious
conduct.
on
the
contrary,
it
is
legitimate
activity
that
the
act
was
designed
to
reach,
for
there's
already
a
clutter
of
criminal
statutes
on
the
books
which
penalize
espionage,
sabotage,
seditious
advocacy
and
provide
for
the
registration
of
foreign
agents.
and
if
congress
per
chance
has
overlooked
any
conduct
injurious
to
the
national
security,
it
could
easily
make
it
punishable
by
legislation
narrowly
drawn
for
that
purpose.
as
president
truman
stated
in
his
veto
message,
the
act
attempts
and
i
quote,
"to
proscribe
for
groups
such
as
the
communists
certain
activities
which
are
perfectly
proper
for
everyone
else.
in
so
doing,
the
act
not
only
violates
the
economy
principle
of
the
first
amendment,
it
also
violates
the
proposition
that
the
government
may
not
intervene
in
the
political
process
by
imposing
special
disabilities
on
any
one
political
group
and
thus
perpetuated
self
in
office
by
handicapping
its
rivals."
the
respondent
argues
that
the
act
is
valid
because
it
strikes
at
a
great
evil
and
congress
could
reasonably
find
that
the
communists,
the
alleged
source
of
the
evil
are
a
danger
to
american
security.
the
inference
from
that
argument
is,
that
once
an
organization
like
petitioner
has
legislatively
and
declared
to
be
a
danger,
all
of
its
advocacy,
intellective
activity
may
be
suppressed
including
the
concededly
non-dangerous.
this
justification
of
the
act
rests
on
an
h-bomb
theory
of
congressional
power.
the
theory
is,
that
whenever
congress
finds
the
existence
of
a
danger,
it
may
throw
an
h-bomb
in
its
general
direction.
that,
of
course,
is
a
very
easy
way
to
get
rid
of
the
danger
if
one
isn't
squeamish
about
the
constitution.
the
court,
however,
putting
the
constitution
first,
has
flatly
rejected
this
h-bomb
theory
in
cases
which
dealt
specifically
with
the
communist
party
and
its
members.
de
jonge
versus
oregon
holds
that
a
member
of
the
communist
party
may
not
be
punished
for
making
a
lawful
speech
under
the
auspices
of
that
organization,
not
withstanding
that
as
this
court
assumed.
the
organization
and
its
members
advocate
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
de
jonge,
as
well
as
herndon
versus
lowry,
established
that
the
right
to
speak
or
assemble
for
lawful
purposes
may
not
be
abridged
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
speaker
or
the
sponsor
of
the
assemblage
may
also
be
engaged
in
some
illegitimate
activity.
again,
although
we
have
--
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
john
j.
abt
again,
although
we
disagree
with
this
court's
decision
in
a.c.a.
versus
douds,
we
believe
that
the
decision
clearly
foreshadowed
the
invalidity
of
this
act
or
douds
sustained
the
non-communist
affidavit
requirement
of
the
taft-hartley
act
only
on
the
premise
that
the
impact
of
section
9
(h)
on
first
amendment
rights
was
both
slight
and
incidental.
and
that,
in
fact,
that
section
did
not
interfere
with
the
right
of
persons
to
be
members
of
the
communist
party,
nor
with
the
right
of
the
communist
party
to
engage
in
legitimate
advocacy.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
not
clear,
justice
harlan,
what
you
mean
by
registration,
if
you
mean,
for
example,
the
corrupt
practices
act,
applicable
without
discrimination
to
all
political
parties
or
the
lobbyist
act
applicable
without
discrimination
to
all
persons
who
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
is
a
party
--
party
defined
in
this
act.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
think,
even
there,
your
honor,
that
the
act
would
be
unconstitutional
that
if
--
if
it
were
nothing
more
than
a
registration
act
which
branded
the
organization
and
branded
the
members
of
the
organization
as
disloyal,
traitors,
criminal
conspirators,
members
of
a
seditious
conspiracy
that
such
an
act
would
be
invalid,
yes,
sir.
we
believe
that
also
pertinent
to
the
issue
here,
is
a
decision
of
a
high
court
of
australia
in
australian
communist
party
versus
commonwealth,
which
i
can't
discuss
here
this
morning,
we
discussed
in
our
brief.
although
the
case
arose
in
a
different
constitutional
setting,
we
think
that
the
action
of
the
high
court
of
australia
in
striking
down
the
australian
act
to
outlaw
the
communist
party
of
that
country,
demonstrates
a
sound
awareness
of
the
minimum
requirement
for
the
protection
of
a
free
society
against
serious
appeals
to
the
national
security.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
said,
your
honor,
it
arose
under
a
different
constitutional
setting,
but
we
believe
that
the
act
and
or
of
the
opinions,
rather,
and
the
opinions
occupying
an
entire
volume
of
the
australian
reports
are
most
pertinent.
the
respondent
does
not
contest
our
demonstration
that
the
act
and
the
order
to
proscribe
advocacy
by
and
association
with
the
petitioner
for
legitimate
purposes.
nevertheless,
that
proceeds
to
defend
the
act
as
though
it
were
a
genuine
disclosure
statute.
in
doing
so,
it
simply
ignores
all
of
the
features
which
make
disclosure
by
registration
impossible
and
show
that
it
was
never
intended.
in
a
further
effort
to
escape
a
defense
of
the
act,
as
written,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
that
the
court
disregard
the
sanctions
entirely.
the
respondent
urged
this
position
on
the
court
below
which
rejected
it.
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
opinion
below,
we
believe
that
the
suggestion
is
unrealistic
and
plainly
sound
--
unsound.
recognizing
that
the
sanctions
of
the
act
are
incompatible
with
the
theory
of
the
act
as
a
disclosure
statute,
the
respondent
also
discusses
them
as
though
they
were
fully
unrelated
to
the
registration
requirement.
we
think
that
this
approach
is
also
unrealistic.
nevertheless,
our
brief
analyzes
the
sanctions
individually
and
shows
that
each
is
invalidated
by
the
same
advise
that
condemns
the
act
as
a
whole,
or
none
of
the
sanctions
is
limited
or
even
reasonably
related
for
the
control
of
injurious
activities.
their
function
individually
and
collectively
is
not
to
protect
the
national
security,
but
to
place
a
heavy
deterrent
on
the
right
of
association
by
making
the
cost
of
membership
and
the
petitioner
completely
prohibitive.
the
act
is
condemned
by
the
first
amendment,
not
only
because
it
proscribes
feasible
advocacy
and
association,
but
also
because
on
it's
face
and
as
applied
by
the
board
and
the
court
below.
its
sanctions
are
imposed
as
penalties
for
the
exercise
of
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
this
is
apparent
in
the
first
place
from
section
13
(e)
of
the
act
which
instructs
the
board
to
consider
eight
criteria
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
organization
is
a
communist
action
organization.
as
appears
from
an
inspection
of
that
section,
a
majority
of
the
criteria
focused
on
views,
policies
and
their
expression.
none
of
these
criteria
requires
proof
of
any
of
the
criminal
activities
attributed
to
communist
organizations
by
section
2.
for
example,
section
13
(e)
(2)
of
the
act
required
the
board
to
consider
the
extent
to
which
petitioner's
views
and
policies
did
not
deviate
from
those
of
the
soviet
union.
these
views
and
policies
need
to
be
neither
seditious,
dangerous
or
even
false.
they
may
be
patently
valid
and
in
the
best
interest
of
the
american
people,
yet
they
provide
one
of
the
bases
for
the
imposition
of
the
liabilities
and
penalties
of
the
act
simply
because
they
are
similar
to
soviet
views
and
policies.
in
applying
this
criterion
which
the
court
below
characterized
and
i
quote
as
"furnishing
one
of
the
chief
items
of
evidence
in
the
case."
the
board
rested
its
finding
against
petitioner
impart
on
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
and
the
soviet
union
advocated
such
legitimate
and
widely
held
views
as
that
the
chiang
kai-shek
regime
while
on
the
mainland
of
china
was
reactionary
and
corrupt,
that
the
people's
republic
of
china
should
be
admitted
into
the
united
nations,
that
the
united
states
and
the
united
nations
should
not
have
intervened
in
the
korean
war,
or
that
prohibition
of
the
use
of
atomic
weapons
as
proposed
in
the
stockholm
resolution
was
in
the
interest
of
world
peace.
now,
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
that
if
the
heresy
of
non-deviation
from
soviet
use,
such
as
these,
can
be
penalized,
then
indeed,
governmental
control
over
political
association
and
expression
is
completely
unlimited.
in
fact
the
act's
provisions
concerning
front
and
infiltrated
organizations
as
well
as
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act
already
penalize
non-deviation
from
the
views
of
the
petitioner,
the
communist
party.
and
it
is
a
common
place
of
current
politics
to
brand
as
communist
any
views
of
your
political
opponent.
this
is
a
technique
which
was
refined
and
perfected
by
mccarthyism.
what
the
act
does
is
to
enshrine
it,
freeze
it
into
law
and
arm
it
with
the
intolerable
sanctions.
not
long
ago,
president
eisenhower
eloquently
stated
one
of
the
tenets
of
the
democratic
creed
as
applied
to
the
communists.
they
are
a
part
of
america,
he
said,
and
even
if
they
think
ideas
that
are
contrary
to
ours,
they
have
a
right
to
have
them,
a
right
to
record
them,
and
a
right
to
have
them
in
places
where
they
are
accessible
to
others.
it
is
unquestioned
or
it
is
not
america.
we
submit
that
in
depriving
communists
of
these
unquestioned
rights,
the
act
does
and
must
of
necessity
deny
them
to
every
american.
indeed,
we
believe
that
validation
of
the
act
and
the
order
of
the
board
would
be
a
signal
to
the
world
that
our
america
has
lost
its
faith
in
the
democratic
process.
i
come
now
to
the
act's
violation
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
the
registration
order
requires
petitioner's
officers
to
perform
an
act,
the
signing
and
filing
of
a
registration
statement
which
constitutes
an
admission
of
their
membership
and
officership
in
the
communist
party.
the
court
has
held,
however,
that
such
an
admission
cannot
be
compelled.
the
registration
requirement
therefore
is
a
crass
violation
of
the
privilege.
a
majority
of
the
court
below
held
and
the
respondent
argues
here
that
adjudication
of
the
privilege
is
premature
in
this
proceeding.
respondent
urges
that
the
privilege
must
be
claimed
to
be
enjoyed,
that
the
officers
may
never
claim
it
and
that
those
who
desire
to
do
so
will
have
an
opportunity
to
assert
on
the
registration
form
to
be
filed
with
attorney
general.
this
argument
overlooks
the
crucial
fact
which
makes
the
situation
of
the
officers
unique.
that
fact
is
that
a
claim
of
privilege
to
the
attorney
general
is
itself
an
incriminating
admission
that
the
claimant
is
an
office
of
the
petitioner.
the
respondent's
suggested
procedure
would
give
the
officers
the
illusory
choice
of
incriminating
themselves
by
signing
and
filing
a
statement
or
--
or
making
the
same
incriminating
admission
by
asserting
their
privilege
not
to
sign
and
file
a
statement.
since,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
to
assert
the
privileges
to
surrender
it,
its
assertion
cannot
be
made
a
condition
to
adjudication
that
the
privilege
protects
the
officers.
the
respondent
also
contends
that
adjudication
of
the
privilege
question
is
premature
because
if
and
when
the
privileges
are
asserted,
it
might
have
be
found
to
have
been
waived
by
some
of
the
officers
by
virtue
of
prior
admissions
made
by
them.
we
show
in
our
brief,
in
the
first
place,
that
none
of
the
factors
suggested
by
the
respondent
even
if
it
--
even
if
they
should
apply
to
the
particular
officers
of
the
petitioner,
at
the
time
that
registration
is
required,
would
constitute
a
waiver
of
the
privilege.
but
beyond
that,
and
perhaps
more
important
than
that,
hypothetical
possibilities
of
waiver
cannot
be
a
bar
to
adjudication
of
the
issue
at
this
time.
the
question
of
waiver
by
a
particular
individual
can
arise
only
at
the
time
that
that
individual
asserts
the
privilege.
but
the
act
deprives
the
officers
here
of
any
opportunity
for
its
assertion,
so
questions
of
waiver
can
never
arise.
the
respondent
also
argues
that
if
claims
of
privilege
should
be
made
by
the
officers
and
should
be
honored,
the
only
result
would
be
to
make
the
registration
order
unenforceable,
not
void.
this
argument
rest
on
the
same
false
premise
as
the
others.
since
the
act
and
the
order
necessarily
violate
the
privilege
by
making
its
assertion
incriminating,
the
act
does
not
only
unenforceable
in
a
particular
case
but
is
void
on
its
face.
we
believe,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
decision
in
united
states
versus
boyd
decisively
refutes
all
of
the
respondent's
contentions
and
supports
the
propositions
that
i
have
just
advanced.
the
statute
in
that
case
confronted
a
suspected
tax
evader
and
a
forfeiture
proceeding
with
the
choice
of
producing
his
books
to
refute
the
charges
against
him
or
suffering
the
charges
to
be
taken
as
confessed
against
him.
the
court
held
that
the
statute
necessarily
conflicted
with
the
privilege.
accordingly,
it
held
the
statute
not
merely
unenforceable
in
a
particular
case
before
it
but
void.
and
for
the
same
reason
that
reached
this
conclusion
without
consideration
of
the
doctrine
that
the
privilege
must
be
asserted
in
order
to
be
availed
of
and
also
without
any
consideration
of
questions
of
waiver.
the
respondent
contends
finally
on
the
--
the
authority
of
united
states
versus
white
that
the
privilege
is
not
available
to
the
petitioner's
officers.
the
white
case
is
completely
inapplicable.
all
that
that
case
held
was
that
the
officers
of
an
organization
are
not
privileged
or
not
protected
by
the
privilege
from
producing
the
books
of
the
organization
on
the
grounds
that
the
contents
of
those
books
might
incriminate
them.
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
it
isn't
the
contents
of
the
books
that
are
incriminating,
but
the
fact
of
the
officer's
position
with
and
membership
in
the
petitioner,
and
those
facts
are
facts
which
this
court
has
held
that
cannot
–
admission
of
which
cannot
be
compelled.
mr.
john
j.
abt
what
do
they
disclose
or
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
you
mean
what
--
what
do
they
require
to
state
in
the
registration
statements,
your
honor?
well,
my
--
my
point
is
it
quite
a
part
from
the
contents
of
that
registration
statement,
the
mere
filing
of
a
registration
statement
signed
by
the
officers
of
the
organization
as
it
must
be
constitutes
an
admission
that
the
signatories
are
officers
of
the
communist
party.
and
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
admission
apart
from
anything
else
that
the
registration
statement
may
contain
that
that
admission
cannot
be
compelled.
so,
we're
dealing
here
not
with
the
contents
of
the
report
but
the
incriminating
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
fact
that
the
officers
are
officers.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
we
--
we
--
that
claim
is
we
don't
--
we
don't
make
the
claim
because
it's
unnecessary
to
--
to
claim
it,
sir,
because
the
mere
signing
and
filing
of
the
statement
is
itself
the
incriminating
admission.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
attorney
general
has
issued
regulations
which
require
all
members
of
the
governing
board
of
the
organization
to
sign
and
file
a
statement.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
was
not
going
to
treat
the
immunity
section,
you
honor,
because
both
we,
the
court
below
and
the
government
agree
that
the
immunity
section
doesn't
affect
the
privilege
because
it
is
not
coextensive
with
it,
it
doesn't
give
complete
immunity
in
section
4
(f).
simply
gives
immunity
--
simply
provides
that
--
that
the
--
the
fact
of
membership
or
officership
in
a
communist
organization
shall
not
per
se
be
a
crime,
but
it
doesn't
prevent
the
use
of
the
incriminating
admission
as
a
lead
in
the
prosecution
of
other
crimes,
and
therefore
isn't
coextensive
with
the
privilege.
we
say,
therefore,
that
the
privilege
is
available
to
its
--
to
the
officers
and
that
its
assertion
at
this
time
is
not
premature.
since
the
filing
of
a
registration
statement
would
directly
and
substantially
injure
the
petitioner,
it
has
a
standing
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
requirement
that
the
officers
file
such
a
statement
in
this
proceeding.
we
submit,
therefore,
that
the
act
and
the
order
should
be
held
invalid
as
violating
the
privilege.
our
next
point
is,
that
the
act
violates
the
due
process
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
sir?
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
that
--
that
doesn't
help,
your
honor,
because
all
--
all
that
you
read
so
far
that
the
section
does
go
further
and
all
that
you
read
so
far
is
that
the
fact
of
registration
cannot
be
introduced
an
evidence.
but
the
fact
of
registration
can
be
used
as
a
lead
in
a
criminal
--
to
--
to
secure
evidence
which
will
be
used
in
a
criminal
prosecution
for
some
other
offense,
there's
nothing
in
4
(f)
that
prevents
that.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
fact
that
you
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
fact
may
be
used
by
the
prosecutor
as
a
lead
to
--
to
collect
the
evidences
on
the
basis
of
which
he
may
prosecute
the
designer.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct,
you
honor.
that's
correct.
and
that
--
and
that's
the
whole
basis
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
in
fact,
per
se
shall
not
--
membership
per
se
shall
not
be
a
crime.
let
--
let
me
get
to
the
section,
you
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
thanks.
first,
either
a
holding
of
office
or
membership
shall
per
se
be
a
violation
of
any
criminal
statute.
now,
that
--
that's
not
sufficient,
your
honor,
obviously,
because
the
fact
the
membership
may
be
illegal
nor
shall
a
fact
of
registration
be
received
in
evidence.
now,
you
don't
have
to
introduce
that
prosecutor
doesn't
have
to
introduce
the
fact
of
registration
an
evidence,
he
can
use
the
fact
of
registration
as
--
as
a
lead
in
the
prosecution
for
crime.
so
that
fairly,
the
--
the
immunity
isn't
coextensive
with
the
privilege.
doesn't
--
doesn't
prevent
the
use
of
--
use
of
the
registration
for
--
for
prosecutive
purposes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
--
that's
correct
and
from
proceeding
from
that
clue
to
a
--
collect
evidence
which
results
in
a
prosecution.
that
is
clear,
i
think,
under
the
councilman,
bryan
and
other
cases
that
that
--
that
the
immunity
therefore
isn't
coextensive
with
the
privilege.
mr.
john
j.
abt
any
matter
or
thing
in
connection
with
drawing
out
of
his
membership
in
the
organization,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
doesn't
come
in
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
plays
no
part,
your
honor,
because
that
immunity
statute
applies
only
to
grand
jury
proceedings
and
to
proceedings
before
congressional
committees
so
that
it
couldn't
be
invoked
by
the
attorney
general
here.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
it
does
not,
no,
sir.
and
there
was
--
the
respondent
concedes
here
that
it
has
no
application.
mr.
john
j.
abt
wouldn't
even
come
in,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
the
immunity
statute
gives
the
court,
a
court
on
the
request
to
the
attorney
general
the
right
to
grant
immunity
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
now,
we
have
--
we
have
no
grand
jury
proceeding
here.
the
incriminating
admission
is
made
extra
judicially
so
that
obviously,
it
has
no
application.
the
next
and
final
point
which
i
shall
argue
is
that
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
he
suggested
that
immunity
might
be
given
under
the
fact
but
he
was
obviously
mistaken
in
this
that
--
the
matter
wasn't
discussed
either
in
our
briefs
and
our
argument,
and
never
arose,
and
as
i
understand
the
respondent
here
in
their
brief,
they
concede
that
the
immunity
statute
has
no
effect.
they
suggest
that
might
some
time
be
amended
to
apply
to
the
situation
but
i
don't
think
that
we're
interested
in
that
kind
of
hypothesis.
i
now
come
to
the
point
that
the
act
violates
due
--
the
process
of
prohibition
against
fiat
legislation,
but
we
call
act's
guilt
in
verdict
against
the
petitioner
has
two
aspects,
one
of
which
i
shall
discuss
and
the
other
which
i
shan't
have
no
time
to
discuss.
in
the
first
instance,
section
3
(3)
of
the
act
defines
a
communist-action
organization
as
an
organization
which
is
controlled
by
the
world
communist
movement
described
in
section
2
and
operates
to
advance
the
objectives
of
that
movement
as
described
in
section
2.
hence,
petitioner
cannot
be
a
communist-action
organization
unless
there
in
fact
exists
a
world
communist
movement
of
the
character
and
nature
described
in
section
2.
due
process,
therefore,
requires
that
the
petitioner
be
accorded
to
hearing
or
an
opportunity
to
litigate
this
question
of
fact.
the
act,
however,
denies
the
petitioner
any
opportunity
to
do
so.
instead,
section
3
(3),
that
is
a
section
which
defines
a
communist-action
organization
presupposes
the
existence
of
a
world
communist
movement
of
the
kind
found
by
congress
in
section
2.
well,
these
findings
are
incorporated
into
the
section
3
(3)
definition
in
the
form
of
assumptions
of
fact
which
the
board
has
no
authority
to
reexamine,
but
which
it's
required
to
accept
as
a
foundation
for
its
decision.
both,
the
respondent
and
the
court
below,
agree
with
us
that
the
section
2
findings,
with
respect
to
the
nature,
character
of
the
world
communist
movement,
are
conclusive
both
on
the
board
and
the
courts.
respondent
urges,
however,
that
this
does
not
result
in
the
denial
of
due
process
because
the
section
2
findings
are
merely,
it
says,
findings
of
legislative
facts
which
the
court
--
the
policy
of
the
law
as
distinguished
from
findings
of
adjudicated
facts
necessary
to
bring
a
particular
organization
within
the
purview
of
the
law.
of
course,
it's
true
that
the
section
2
findings
were
intended
to
support
the
policy
of
the
act
and
with
no
doubt
about
that,
but
congress
didn't
stop
there,
it
went
further.
it
incorporated
those
findings
into
the
definition.
by
doing
so,
it
made
the
liability
of
a
particular
organization
to
register
dependent
upon
the
existence
of
facts
which
have
found
legislatively
and
legislatively
only
and
which
the
organization
is
foreclosed
from
litigating.
it
does
make
findings
of
adjudicated
facts
and
i
take
it
that
the
respondent
concedes
that
we
have
a
right,
that
is
the
petitioner
in
this
proceeding,
had
a
right
to
litigate
all
adjudicated
facts.
if
those
facts,
therefore,
are
adjudicated
facts,
the
act
violated
due
process
by
denying
the
petitioner
the
right
to
litigate
them.
the
act
implies
a
second
device
to
predetermine
the
case
against
petitioner
by
making
the
identical
findings
in
section
2
which
--
as
it
turns
up,
ostensibly
found
by
the
board
in
the
hearing
determine
the
petitioner's
liability
to
register
the
communist-action
organization.
i
don't
have
time
to
analyze
section
2
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
assertion.
we
do
it
in
the
brief.
we
say
that
it's
perfectly
clear
from
section
2,
from
the
legislative
history
and
indeed
from
this
court's
opinion
in
carlson
versus
landon
that
section
2
makes
all
of
the
findings
against
the
petitioner,
the
communist
party
necessary
for
a
registration
order
requiring
it
to
register
as
a
communist-action
organization.
it's
true
that
those
findings,
as
distinguished
with
the
--
from
the
findings
with
reference
to
a
world
communist
movement
are
extensively
to
be
adjudicated
by
the
board.
we
say
that
it
would
be
factious
to
suppose
that
the
board
would
make
findings
contrary
to
those
made
by
congress
on
the
identical
subject
and
particularly
where
the
findings
themselves
are
preceded
by
the
statement
that
they
were
based
on
evidence
adduced
before
congressional
committees.
we
say,
therefore,
that
in
both
aspects,
the
act,
by
predetermining
the
result
against
petitioner
by
fiat
violates
due
process
and
invalidates
the
act
as
a
whole.
mr.
john
j.
abt
fifteen
months,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
length
of
the
proceeding
has
--
has
any
significance
in
terms
of
the
results.
mr.
john
j.
abt
they
went
through
a
lot
of
motions
in
our
judgement,
your
honor.
we
--
we
insist
that
the
proceeding
was
a
formality
because
the
result
was
predetermined
and
we
cite
the
legislative
history
in
our
brief.
i
haven't
gone
into
it
here
this
morning
to
show
that
the
legislative
history
itself
very
plainly
demonstrates
that
the
very
reason
for
the
enactment
of
this
act
was
that
congress
found
it
necessary
to
predetermine
these
questions
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
was
toward
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
was
a
petition,
yes
sir
and
they
answered
it.
mr.
john
j.
abt
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
we
certainly
did.
we
want
--
not
only
did
we
demur
before
the
board,
your
honor,
we
filed
a
proceeding
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
which
came
here,
if
your
honor
remembers.
mr.
john
j.
abt
we
could
have
your
honor
but
that
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
that
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
--
that's
perfectly
correct
and
then
we
would
have
brought
that
issue
and
that
issue
alone
to
this
court.
we
--
we
thought,
as
long
as
we
were
coming
here,
we'd
bring
some
other
issues
along
with
it.
mr.
john
j.
abt
is
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
--
the
--
first
questions
as
--
the
questions
as
to
the
act
on
its
face,
yes
sir,
not
questions
as
to
the
application
of
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
abt
all
the
questions
that
i
have
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
all
questions
are
--
can
be
raised.
mr.
john
j.
abt
questions
as
to
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
i'm
about
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
about
to
tell
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
permit
me,
questions
as
to
the
substantiality
of
the
evidence,
questions
as
to
the
application
of
the
act
by
the
board,
we
charge
that
the
board
violated
the
act
and
application.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no.
we
--
we
say
that
the
board
misconstrued
and
misapplied
the
act,
your
honor.
but
it
misconstrued
and
misapplied,
for
example,
the
criteria
of
section
(13)
(e).
mr.
forer's
going
to
argue
that
point.
we
have
a
whole
series
of
other
points
on
application
which
we
wouldn't
have
had,
had
there
been
no
such
proceeding.
thank
you.
