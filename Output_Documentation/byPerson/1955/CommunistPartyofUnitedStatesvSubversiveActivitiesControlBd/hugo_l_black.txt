kind
of

this
apply
to?

this
act.

black
yes.

i'm
not
talking

what
does
its
definition
include?
what
kind
of
organization?

what
are
the
names
of
it?
justice

black
i
didn't
make
my
position

my
question
clear.
does
it
apply
to
business
organizations?
justice

black
well,
it
--
suppose
it
could
be
established
than
an
insurance
company
was

the
satisfaction
of

would

could
the

be
required

as
to

board.

that

that

associated,
as
it
says
here,
with
these
ideas
and
beliefs.
justice
hugo

black
well,
what
--
what
i'm
asking
is,
is
there
any
limitation
to
the
type
of
organization
which
can
be
found
to
be

subject
to

act?

well,
is
--
is
this
definition
broad
enough
to
include
an
insurance
company?
justice
hugo

black
is
it
--
is
it
broad
enough
--
justice

is
it

yes.
justice

black
only
those
--
justice

black
--
are
under
the
act
if
this
board,
after
hearing
of
evidence,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
conclude
that
they
should
be
under
the
act,
under
the
standards
prescribed,
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
attorney
general
found
sometime
ago
that
an
insurance
company
was
so
dominated,
engaged
in
the
business
of
insurance.
if
this
board
should
find
out
about
this
insurance
company,
would
it
be
included
under
this
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
are
passing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
this
act
and
its
language.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
--
if
someone
failed
to
register,
did
not
register
--
you
say
this
is
a
registration
act.
if
someone
failed
to
register
under
the
ordinary
registration
act
and
that
was
made
a
crime
and
they
were
tried
by
a
jury,
what
would
be
the
issues?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
there's
a
--
they're
indicted
for
not
registering.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
question
is,
suppose
the
act
provides
that
any
organization
which
is
engaged
in
propaganda
for
subversion
must
register.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
understand
that,
include
it
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
you've
been
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
include
--
including
all
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it
charged,
if
the
act
provides
that
any
organization
engaged
in
those
activities,
all
you
can
think
of,
would
have
to
register,
committed
a
crime
not
to
register
and
they
charge
that
organization
with
not
having
registered
and
try
them
before
a
jury,
what
would
be
the
issues?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it
was
engaged
in
those
activities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
the
issue
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
here,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
board
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
determines
in
the
other
instance
of
the
registration
act
you
--
you
talked
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
jury
would
have
to
determine
subject
to
control
by
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
the
juries
do
not,
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
asking
you
the
question
of
whether
you
can
short
circuit
the
violation
of
a
criminal
act
where
you
require
somebody
to
register
or
--
or
a
person
and
this
would,
i
suppose
include
a
person
or
association
of
a
person
or
a
corporation
or
a
partnership
to
require
them
to
register
if
they
are
engaged
in
certain
activities,
you
have
likened
this
to
a
simple
registration
act
and
i'm
with
you
on
the
idea
that
you
can
require
registration.
if
that
were
the
case,
they
would
be
tried
for
failing
to
register
but
the
government
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
they
were
engaged
in
the
kind
of
activities
which
were
define
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
here,
it's
done
by
a
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
understand
that
that
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
it
--
but
does
that
or
does
it
not,
is
that
or
is
it
not
the
same
thing
as
a
regular
act
which
would
prescribe
for
instance
that
--
or
campaign
contributions
must
be
reported
and
if
they
had
not
reported,
the
man
can
be
tried.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
try
and
they
must
prove
the
campaign
contributions
brought
to
before
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
be
entitled
to
have
a
jury
trial
of
the
issues
which
the
board
had
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
would
he
be
entitled
to
jury
trial
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
an
insurance
company
is
found
to
be
covered
by
--
by
the
board
and
its
defense
of
criminal
prosecution
on
the
ground
that
it's
not,
could
it
depend
on
the
ground
that
it
has
not
engaged
in
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
even
if
it
destroyed
every
dollar
of
insurance
front
company's
property,
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
facts
which
were
basically
the
subject
of
its
conviction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
one
is
not
but
one
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
attorney
general's
belief
was
that
we
had
before
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
an
act
that
is
subject
to
the
broadest
interpretation
which
undermines
the
basic
principles
of
the
bill
of
right,
if
it
does
with
reference
to
accusing
and
it's
capable
of
being
extended
to
others,
how
can
anyone
know
to
whom
it
will
be
extended
tomorrow?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
care
to
state
my
view
except
to
this
extent,
my
idea
that
in
this
nation
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
his
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
which
includes
a
trial
by
court
and
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
analogous
to
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
connection
with
your
lobbying
example
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
congress
says
it's
a
crime
not
to
register
as
a
lobbyist
and
then
it
turned
over
to
an
agency
such
as
this
one,
the
power
to
determine
first
whether
the
man
was
actually
engaged
in
lobbying
and
then
you
came
up
and
said
he
--
he
was
tried.
you
submitted
to
the
jury
the
question
not
whether
he
was
engaged
in
lobbying
because
that
could
have
been
decided
by
the
board,
but
you
submitted
to
the
jury
the
question
whether
he
had
failed
to
register.
could
you
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
you
make
it
a
crime
for
a
lobbyist
to
fail
to
register
and
then
permit
determination
of
the
facts
of
whether
he
is
a
lobbyist
to
be
decided
by
a
board
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
give
them
--
throw
him
before
the
jury
with
the
sole
defense
of
whether
he
failed
to
register.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right,
take
--
let's
take
for
instance
the
--
the
example
the
chief
gave
you.
i
think
mine
is
pretty
close
to
lobbyist
but
let's
take
the
other
one,
it's
probably
a
little
closer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
an
organization
of
people
engaged
in
the
cattle
business
in
western
utah
and
you
appoint
a
board
and
they
find
that
while
they're
--
they're
all
engaged
in
the
cattle
business
and
they
have
an
association.
but
the
board
at
the
hearing
determines
that
they
are
--
the
organization
has
been
engaged
in
stealing
cattle
and
then
you
try
a
man
for
failing
to
--
you
tried
him
for
failing
to
register
and
you
impose
a
sanction
on
everybody
that
belongs
to
it
or
belonging
to
it
and
say
they
can't
get
a
passport.
they
can't
get
a
job
at
certain
places.
you
think
congress
could
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
of
course
if
you
say
that
there's
no
possibility
of
this
particular
group
doing
anything
illegal
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
you
did
say
that
they
might
say
that
they
were
for
unemployment
insurance
and
things
like
that.
but
here,
you
have
an
organization
that
the
chief
asked
you,
are
you
going
to
permit
a
board
to
determine
whether
a
certain
group,
association
or
such
nature
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
man
belongs
to
it
without
letting
him
--
letting
them
try
those
facts
to
the
court
jury,
subject
him
to
sanctions
under
the
law
imposed
by
the
federal
government
all
over
the
--
sanctions
from
everybody
all
over
the
united
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
depends
on
who
decides
the
nature
of
the
activity
if
you
are
going
to
penalize
them,
by
the
board,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
congress
would
just
say,
"you
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
a
jury
at
all."
could
they
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
congress
gave
a
board
the
right
to
--
in
effect
delegated
the
power
to
fix
a
general
price
applicable
to
everybody
alike.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
well,
the
importance
of
today
is
the
communist
party.
i
understand
that
fully
from
what
you've
said
and
what
i've
read,
but
the
--
the
language
does
not
limit
thereby
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
they
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
--
let's
take
suppose
they
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that's
right.
do
you
think
by
that,
that
that
gives
congress
any
more
right?
you
--
you
bring
that
up
each
time.
you
think
that
gives
them
any
more
right
if
they
have
done
it,
to
deprive
them
of
a
trial
by
jury
than
it
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
yes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
trial
by
--
do
you
think
that
--
that
gives
congress
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
(inaudible)
and
we
don't
--
we're
not
like
and
they
are
dangerous,
the
right
to
have
them
tried
without
the
benefits
of
a
trial
by
a
jury
where
they
tried
to
attack.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
but
that
is
foreclosed
when
they
get
there
because
a
board
has
passed
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
--
and
you
of
course
wouldn't
say
that
that
was
justified
because
they're
communists
rather
than
--
than
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
say
that
--
would
you
say
that
if
they
are
conspirators
against
the
government
and
you
could
prove
it
before
a
jury
that
you
can
assume
that
and
therefore
try
them
before
a
board?
