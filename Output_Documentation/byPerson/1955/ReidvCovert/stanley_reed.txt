now,
just
to
--
what
--
what
is
the
basis
that
you're
arguing
now,
the
constitutional
basis
for
this?
justice
stanley

but
it
isn't
because
it's
--
as
i
--
if
i
understand
your
argument,
it's
not
because
it's
military
in
its
sense.
it
would
be
just
like
the
ross
case
where
he
was
a
seaman
on
a
ship
and
he's
out
in
an
american
ship.

they
wouldn't

well
(voice

justice

i

the

the
very

the

so,
that

that
any
american,
any
place
with
the
permission
of
the
country
where
he
is
may
be
tried
by
an
official
duly
appointed

but,
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
the
war
power,
you
do
as
i
understand
it,
between
the
war
power
and
the
clause
which
gives
it
all
over
the
armed
forces.
justice
stanley

suppose
you
--
the
army
said
that
her
wife
wanted
to
go
overseas
with
her
husband
that
she
had
to
enlist,
you
were
saying,
they
wouldn't
pay
her
any
money
to
perform
the
same
duties
or
whatever
duties
she's
performing
that
they
didn't
perform
in
this
case,
would
that
change
the
situation?
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
think
they
had
a
paper
transaction
of
that
type
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
question?
