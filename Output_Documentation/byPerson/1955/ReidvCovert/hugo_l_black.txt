under

law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
what
law
you
were
defining
the
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
435
include
both
civilians
who
work
for
the
army
and
civilians
who
do
not
work
for
the
army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
how
do
you
divide
it
up
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
camp
followers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
--
i
thought
they
were
brought
over
for
washing
and
for
hospital
service
according
to
page
85.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
construed
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
--
those
as
assumed
on
the
basis
that
great
britain
was
occupied
in
this
country
like
when
the
country
occupies
another
and
for
a
time
always,
the
military
runs
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
promulgate
the
laws
and
to
enforce
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
jamestown,
i'm
talking
about.
you
talked
about
jamestown
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
chaos
at
that
time
because
of
the
indians.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
occupied
the
country,
great
britain
did
and
they
occupied
it
with
the
military
first,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
to
move
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i'm
maybe
wrong,
i'm
not
talking
about
semantics.
i
suppose
that
--
what
i
was
pointing
out
was
that
there
is
a
well-recognized
differences
in
that,
between
the
laws
of
a
--
the
way
you
enforce
laws
in
an
occupied
country,
pending
as
you
said,
at
the
time
of
incorporation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
the
only
thing
i
had
difficult
with,
mr.
justice,
was
whether
--
whether
that
stage
changed
and
i'm
not
sure
of
my
history
note,
say
in
1620,
whether
there
was
enough
for
the
colony
establish
so
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
governmental
operation
or
not.
certainly,
there
were
not
civil
courts
which
might
lead
it
to
be
considered
occupied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
leader
was
captain
smith,
wasn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
its
no
--
no
different,
no
reason
to
distinguish
the
power
in
time
of
war
and
time
of
peace?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
the
cost
of
giving
a
jury
a
trial
wouldn't
--
shouldn't
have
any
weight
in
connection
with
this
right
to
an
attorney.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
civilians
are
there?
how
many
civilians
and
soldiers
are
there
abroad,
if
you're
going
to
serve
soldiers
--
use
soldiers
that
could
be
summoned
on
juries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right,
where
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
wives
--
most
of
them
where
their
wives
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i
have
to
say,
in
that
area
where
their
wives
are
in
the
main.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
they're
--
yes.
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
as
the
absolute
in
this
(inaudible)
to
provide
a
less
satisfactory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
england
used
--
england
used
jury
trial
--
juries
to
try
its
consular
cases
for
many
years,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
had
any
cases
where
you
did
bring
defendants
back
here
in
time
before
jury
for
the
witnesses
brought
here
from
abroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
--
somehow
you
did,
haven't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
american
civilians
are
in
italy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
wife
or
any
other
member
of
the
family
of
any
soldier
ever
been
tried
by
court-martial
before
these
women
were,
in
this
country
since
the
constitution
was
adopted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
had
a
--
it's
difficult
to
give
a
complete
break
down
because
some
of
them
have
been
tried
under
the
--
in
the
foreign
country.
they
are
serious
cases.
and
they
have
that
right
if
we
don't
exercise
the
jurisdiction
to
obtain
a
waiver
or
we're
unable
to
obtain
a
waiver
and
so
forth.
and
then,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
regard
to
those
that
--
that
have
been
tried
by
the
court-martial.
most
of
the
cases
are
for
the
lesser
offenses.
there,
a
number
of
the
serious
offenses
is
relatively
few,
but
they're
substantial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
these
--
this
woman
have
been
tried
in
england
under
their
law,
she'd
have
a
jury,
wouldn't
she?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
discussed
in
your
brief
how
we
could
reconcile
adopting
your
position
here
which
is
that
women
who
have
never
served
in
the
army
to
be
tried
by
court-martial
for
crimes
committed
abroad
but
that
soldiers
abroad
who
commit
identically
the
same
crime
cannot
constitutionally
be
tried
by
court-martial
after
they
have
left
the
army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i'm
little
interested
in
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
woman
was
--
all
of
her
lifetime
of
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
--
but
there's
--
certainly
been
along
the
record
of
trying
soldiers
in
a
stronger
record
than
trying
wisely
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we'll
hear
that
--
we'll
hear
from
mr.
wiener
on
that,
(inaudible)
i
have
just
been
curious
to
know
how
the
court
could
possibly
say
that
a
soldier
cannot
be
tried
for
committing
a
crime
abroad,
wholly
because
he's
been
put
out
of
the
army,
but
women
who'd
never
been
in
the
army
can
be
tried
by
court-martial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
as
closely
as
the
soldier?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
discussed
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
discussed
in
your
history
--
have
you
stated
in
your
history,
when
was
the
first
time
in
this
country
even
a
soldier
could
be
tried
for
the
civilian
crime
of
murder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
would
find
it
was
about
1863?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
air
force
is
not
a
part
of
the
armed
forces,
i'd
imagine
they
wouldn't
like
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
they
consider
they're
rather
important
part
of
the
armed
forces.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
--
the
plane
has
to
start
from
the
land
and
go
back
to
the
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
do
you
find
the
delegated
authority
in
the
constitution
which
says
that
the
military
at
any
time
can
ever
exercise
authority
over
anybody
except
members
of
the
land
and
naval
forces?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
that
--
did
hamilton
indicate
in
anyway
or
did
anybody
connect
it
with
the
constitution,
indicated
anything
they've
said
about
the
constitution
on
any
debate
anywhere
that
the
army
would
ever
have
the
right
to
try
wise
independence
of
soldiers?
i
have
looked
forth
and
couldn't
find
it,
i
wonder
if
you
found
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recalled
it,
those
debates
showed
a
very
part
of
the
activity
to
a
standing
army
at
all,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
idea
was,
the
only
way
to
get
away
from
there
with
too
much
power,
or
purge
by
someone
was,
they
wouldn't
have
a
standing
army
and
they'd
forbid
it.
they
would
have
--
only
depend
on
people
drawn
from
the
states
as
a
part
of
the
national
guard.
then
they
compromised
or
decided
to
get
in
by
giving
them
the
very
--
just
what
you
say
words,
military
--
they
have
rules.
they
could
have
rules,
the
governor,
the
land
and
naval
forces.
but
there,
as
i
call
recall
it,
the
big
result
of
which
and
all
the
way
through
that,
not
merely
for
giving
them
power
to
try
civilian
but
have
a
standing
army
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
probably
from
what
i
read,
they
didn't
want
to
leave
the
civilians
without
any
defense
from
the
army.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
did
anybody
say
that
about
the
power
to
try
civilians,
any
debates?
