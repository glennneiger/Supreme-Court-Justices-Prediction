mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
reargument
case,
the
court
handed
down
the
opinion
by
a
spring
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
congress
has
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
confer
jurisdiction
on
a
court-martial
to
try
a
dependent
wife
of
a
member
of
the
u.s.
air
force
residing
in
public
quarters
on
a
base
in
a
foreign
country
for
alleged
murder
of
her
husband
there.
if
court
asked
for
general
reargument,
as
we
understand,
but
also
asked
for
such
answers
as
we
are
able
to
give
to
certain
specific
questions.
the
particular
questions
were
the
specific
practical
necessities
in
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
which
justify
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
civilian
dependents
overseas,
the
practical
alternatives
to
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
court-martial
to
the
historical
evidence
so
far
as
such
evidence
is
available
and
relevant
bearing
on
the
scope
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
authorized
under
article
i,
section
8,
clause
14
in
the
necessary
proper
clause
and
bearing
on
the
relations
of
article
iii
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
in
interpreting
those
clauses.
in
particular,
the
question
whether
such
historical
evidence
points
to
the
conclusion
that
the
article
i,
section
8,
clause
14
power
was
thought
to
have
a
fixed
and
rigid
content,
or
rather
that
this
power
is
modified
by
the
necessity
and
--
necessary
proper
clause
was
considered
a
broad
grant
susceptible
of
expansion
under
changing
circumstances,
three,
the
relevance
for
purposes
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
civilians
overseas
in
time
of
peace
of
any
distinction
between
civilians
employed
by
the
armed
forces
and
civilian
dependents.
with
regard
to
that
question,
i
take
it,
there's
no
problem
between
counsel
in
the
case
because
they
disagree
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
civilian
dependants
and
civilian
employees
for
constitutional
purpose
by
the
parties
and
their
briefs
in
this
court.
the
relevance
--
number
four,
the
relevance
for
purposes
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
civilian
dependents
overseas
in
time
of
peace
of
any
distinctions
between
major
crimes
and
petty
offenses.
before
addressing
ourselves
on
behalf
of
the
government
to
the
particular
questions
asked
by
the
court,
i
would
like
to
review
very
briefly
the
principles
involved
we
think
that
are
controlling
to
the
case.
first
place,
government
contends
that
there's
no
question
about
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
try
persons
such
as
the
defendants
for
crimes
committed
in
a
foreign
country,
the
trial
to
be
held
in
the
foreign
country
by
the
united
states
that
that
is
a
power
that
is
resident
in
the
united
states
by
reason
of
its
sovereignty
and
is
based
upon
what
this
court
has
said
in
curtis
reid
and
the
u.s.
against
belmont,
u.s.
against
pink
and
other
similar
cases
in
regard
to
that
power.
secondly,
we
believed
that
the
court
opinion
in
which
reliance
was
placed
on
the
historical
views
of
a
consular
court,
in
re
ross
is
fully
supported
by
the
action
of
this
court
in
the
past
and
that
that
power
as
delineated
there,
the
sovereign
power
of
the
united
states
is
a
justification
and
basis
for
the
action
in
this
case.
i
might
call
particular
attention
to
that.
there
are
some
question
now
in
the
briefs
about
whether
counsel
did
concede
that
a
trial
by
such
a
consular
court
at
this
time,
being
last
spring
or
when
the
case
was
argued,
could
be
had.
but
in
the
briefs
at
this
time,
there
is
no
argument
that
there
was
not
a
power
in
the
united
states
prior
to
adoption
of
the
constitution
exempting
particularly
and
specifically
the
consular
courts
so
that
it
is
recognized
by
both
parties
that
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
there
was
a
power
to
try
by
means
of
the
concept
of
a
consular
court,
persons
such
as
the
defendants
in
this
case.
now,
we
do
not
think
that
that
power
merely
died
because
of
the
problem
in
regard
to
extraterritoriality.
what
is
involved
in
that
concept
is
the
right
of
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
to
try
a
citizen
by
something
different
than
a
court
requiring
a
jury
trial
and
a
grand
jury's
indictment
and
the
other
--
or
article
iii
requirements
as
to
tenure
of
--
of
the
judges
and
so
forth.
and
that
certainly,
the
united
states,
if
it
had
the
power
prior
to
the
adoption
of
constitution
to
exercise
the
trial,
all
of
the
trials
or
a
person
such
as
the
defendant
by
a
consular
court
could
improve
that
court
and
make
more
due
process
and
add
to
the
protections
and
provisions
to
care
for
the
interest
of
the
defendants
and
was
not
limited
to
whatever
limitations
there
were
in
the
consular
form
which
obviously,
both
parties
were
here
recognized,
all
parties
were
much
more
--
much
less
in
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
defendants
as
far
as
due
process
and
fair
trial
is
concerned
than
what
we
have
in
courts-martial.
we
also
feel
that
the
historical
material
that
we
would
develop
for
the
court
have
in
our
briefs
and
will
--
presentation
here,
fully
justified
the
conclusion
that
in
the
history
of
this
country
and
prior
to
the
constitutional
convention,
the
use
of
court-martials
for
civilian
dependents,
as
well
as
civilian
employers
who
were
connected
in
manners
similar
to
what
is
involved
in
these
cases
with
the
military
was
the
common
practice
and
was
a
necessary,
recognized
as
a
necessary
practice
in
the
handling
of
the
disciplinary
problems
of
the
forces,
both
of
the
british
prior
to
the
war
period,
hostilities,
and
actually
during
the
revolutionary
period,
and
by
our
own
troops
including
certain
statements
by
george
washington
himself
with
regard
to
the
problems
and
difficulties
he
had
with
this
brief
questions.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
have
some
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
so
many
examples
in
time
of
peace.
i
don't
want
to
overstate
the
case.
the
examples
in
time
of
peace
are
questioned
by
counsel
on
the
other
side
saying
that
in
boston,
during
the
colonial
period,
the
british
had
declared
martial
law.
and
we
question
whether
on
your
--
under
any
of
the
concepts
that
this
court
have
stated
regarding
the
necessity,
a
feature
of
martial
law
that
there
could
have
been
martial
law
in
boston,
we
don't
agree
that
there
was
martial
law
but
there
is
that
question
that
they
raised
about
it.
we
have
in
several
examples,
also
a
period
prior
to
--
or
not
during
actual
hostilities
in
canadian
activities
in
--
where
there
were
court-martials
and
by
the
british.
and
they
questioned
those
cases
saying
that
although
the
hostilities,
all
fighting
was
over,
the
british
was
and
there
no
peace
treaty
signed,
and
therefore,
it
was
not
actual
fighting
hostilities
at
that
time.
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
question
is
valid
in
view
of
the
circumstances,
but
we
did
not
find
detailed
cases
beyond
that
of
peacetime
except
several
cases
in
regard
to
india
that
were
after
the
revolutionary
period,
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
we
don't
think
that
they
are
as
good
material,
historical
to
help
the
court
on
the
problem
as
these
incidents
that
occurred
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
which
we
can
assume
from
what
i
will
develop
here.
the
people
in
the
--
the
members
of
the
constitutional
convention
were
well
aware
of.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
the
same
problems
are
developed
and
the
same
reasons,
which
i'll
try
to
show,
are
the
basic
reasons
for
doing
it
during
the
war
period
are
present
during
the
peacetime.
and
that
the
various
commanders
in
describing
their
difficulties
with
--
dealing
with
various
wives
and
dependents
as
well
as
the
civilian
employees
illustrate
that
they
had
this
disciplinary
problem
that
couldn't
be
handled,
otherwise,
and
that's
why
they
had
to
do
it.
the
same
is
true,
we
think,
in
peacetime
and
i
will
try
to
develop
that.
before
proceeding
to
the
history,
i
should
like
to
call
briefly
at
--
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
case
ex
parte
quirin.
i
want
to
make
it
unmistakably
clear
that
that
is
not
the
same
factual
situation
to
this
case
at
all.
there
were
saboteurs
involved
there.
it
wasn't
the
question
of
military
commission.
but
the
court
did
very
carefully
in
unanimous
opinion
examined
some
of
the
materials,
some
of
the
basic
principles
involved
in
the
question
of
whether
persons
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
grand
jury
indictment.
and
i
think
it
is
quite
helpful
and
would
be
quite
helpful
to
the
court
to
examine
for
that
purpose.
i
do
it
for
that
limited
purpose
only.
there,
the
court
said,
present
by
grand
jury
and
trial
by
a
jury
of
the
--
this
nature
where
the
crime
is
committed,
where
at
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
familiar
parts
of
the
machinery
for
trial
in
the
civil
courts.
but
they
were
procedures
unknown
to
military
tribunals
which
are
not
courts
in
the
sense
of
the
judicial
article
and
which
in
the
natural
course
of
events,
are
usually
called
upon
to
function
under
conditions
precluding,
resort
to
such
procedures.
as
this
court
has
often
recognized,
it
was
not
the
purpose
or
effect
of
section
2
of
article
iii,
read
in
the
light
of
the
common
law
to
enlarge
the
then
existing
rights
to
a
jury
trial.
the
object
was
to
preserve
unimpaired
trial
by
jury
in
all
cases
of
a
light
nature
as
they
might
arise
in
the
future
but
not
to
bring
within
the
sweep
of
the
guarantee,
those
cases
in
which
it
was
then
well
understood
that
a
jury
trial
could
not
be
demanded
as
a
matter
of
right.
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments,
while
guaranteeing
the
continuance
of
certain
incidents
of
trial
by
jury,
which
article
iii,
section
2
had
left
unmentioned,
did
not
enlarge
the
right
to
jury
trial
as
it
had
been
established
by
that
article.
then
the
court
went
on
to
refer
to
petty
offenses,
as
the
illustration
citing
cases
by
this
court,
trial
of
criminal
contempt,
action
to
enforce
a
penalty
inflicted
by
congress,
citing
cases,
and
said
no
exception
is
necessary
to
exclude
from
the
operation
of
these
provisions
cases
never
deemed
to
be
within
--
within
the
terms.
now,
concerning
the
application
by
this
court
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
i'll
try
to
develop
that
in
showing
the
history.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
to
look
back
to
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention
and
see
what
was
done
then,
what
the
common
law
was.
and
if
at
that
time
there
was
certain
exempt
exceptions,
and
it
wasn't
conceived
that
a
jury
trial
and
a
grand
jury
indictment
pr
am
article
iii
court,
were
intended
to
cover
a
particular
activity
which
we
all
pretty
well
conceded
about
petty
offenses
for
instance.
then
in
--
if
that's
the
kind
of
a
case
we
have
before
the
court
today,
then
you
can't
take
and
apply
jury
trial
under
the
decision
of
ex
parte
quirin
and
a
long
list
of
cases
by
this
court
to
that
type
of
action
except
by
saying,
“we'll
disregard
all
the
traditions
in
what
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
we're
trying
to
do
in
article
iii
and
we'll
extend
that
regardless.”
and
i
think
that's
the
position.
now,
whether
i
can
establish
that
that
was
the
fact
is
the
question.
mr.
--
mr.
solicitor
general,
as
you
go
along,
would
you
indicate
whether
you
would
make
the
same
argument
that
if
these
people
were
guilty
or
charged,
let's
say,
with
treason
or
other
crime
other
than
murder?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there's
a
little
different
problem
about
treason.
i'll
try
to
cover
that.
i'd
like
to
just
say
about
legislative,
of
course,
that
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
implied
to
the
philippines,
hawaii,
the
area
now
known
as
the
state
of
florida
and
other
area
in
the
country
that
was
included
at
that
time,
when
that
was
still
a
territory
and
not
incorporated
into
the
united
states.
in
puerto
rico
and
all
of
those
cases
that
congress
had
the
power
within
--
that's
what
were
dealing
with
here,
whether
or
not
congress
has
the
power
on
the
constitution
to
provide
for
this
type
of
trial,
had
the
power
to
provide
for
the
trial
of
persons
that
in
those
territories
that
were
not
incorporated
into
the
united
states
by
not
providing
a
jury
trial
or
a
grand
jury
indictment
unless
well
established
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
we
think
that
is
very
material
to
the
consideration
of
this
question.
it's
also
applied
to
the
problem
of
extradition
in
regard
to
the
area
of
cuba,
in
the
neely
case
and
a
very
interesting
involved
presentation
by
the
court
there.
and
that
the
court
held
that
the
territory
of
cuba,
while
as
between
the
united
states
and
other
sovereignties,
was
in
an
occupied
territory
insofar
as
the
people
of
cuba
were
concerned
and
the
united
states
was
a
foreign
country
because
of
the
obligation
that
congress
had
recited
in
legislation
to
restore
as
rapidly
as
possible
with
the
government
in
control
of
that
area
to
the
people
of
cuba
so
that
in
that
regard,
it
is
comfortable
to
the
problem
here
of
foreign
territory.
now
certainly,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
it's
conceded
that
the
cases
involving
territory
not
incorporated
into
the
united
states
are
valid
today.
the
case
involving
a
foreign
country
where
we
don't
have
that
much
control
of
jurisdiction
or
domination
is
a
fortiori.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
so
that
in
effect,
the
court
pleaded
cuba
in
view
of
what
you
said
in
the
platt
amendment
as
though
it
were
france,
namely,
already
set
apart
as
a
member
of
the
family
of
nations?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
is
--
that
is
its
distinction.
yes,
sir.
we
think
that
the
evidence
is
quite
clear
that
in
colonial
revolutionary
period,
the
wives
accompanying
the
troops
will
regard
it
as
necessary
part
of
the
armed
forces.
the
same
was
true
in
regard
to
the
retainers
and
civilians
who
were
part
of
the
group
of
the
military
force
but
not
a
part
of
the
armed
force.
there's
number
of
definitions,
but
generally,
it's
recognized
by
all
of
the
definitions
that
retainers,
the
dependents
that
by
winthrop
that
retainers,
camp
followers
attending
the
army
but
not
in
the
public
service,
by
oxford
dictionary,
a
man
or
woman
who
follows
or
hangs
onto
a
camp
or
army
without
being
in
military
service.
we
were
fortunate
in
finding
a
little
book
which
we
are
supplying
a
copy
of
to
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
which
i
didn't
anticipate
we
could
ever
find
in
bearing
upon
this
subject,
but
it's
entitled
“woman
camp
followers
of
the
american
revolution”
by
walter
hart
blumenthal
in
which
the
question
of
the
history
is
considerably
documented
in
the
appendix,
and
it
is
related
by
a
student
of
this
problem
as
to
what
was
the
practice
during
this
period
regarding
such
persons.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
they
included
in
the
description
wives,
those
who
were
alleged
to
be
wives,
those
who
were
not
wives,
those
who
were
civilian
people
who
were
providing
various
trade
for
the
armed
force.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
under
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
would
think
they
would
be
under
the
sense
of
this
book.
and
i
think
that
that
is
provided
for
otherwise
by
the
question
of
whether
they're
in
the
field.
and
the
fact
that
congress
has
expressed
and
provided
that
if
--
if
they
are
not
in
the
field,
they're
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
so
far
as
power
is
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
power
is
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
they
haven't
done
that
and
so
we
have
a
different
situation.
now,
whether
or
not
this
court
would
say
that
that
was
a
reasonable
action
in
view
of
the
--
or
whether
it
was
arbitrary,
in
view
of
the
difference
in
the
problem
as
we
see
it,
there's
a
difference
in
the
practical
problem
of
women,
dependent
or
the
dependents
and
the
civilian
employees
and
within
the
united
states.
they
don't
get
the
kind
of
a
trial
in
some
--
they
don't
get
a
jury
trial
or
grand
jury
indictment
in
many
states
and
these
courts
held
that
they
don't
have
to
if
they're
tried
under
state
law.
but
there
isn't
the
problem
that
the
military
forces
have
of
trying
to
maintain
discipline
in
the
united
states
where
there
is
the
same
government
or
part
of
the
family
of
governments
that
is
enforcing
the
laws
and
can
be
expected
to
enforce
those
laws
that
--
and
there
are
still
federal
courts
to
act
so
that,
whether
or
not
this
court
would
find
that
it
was
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
to
require
such
military
court
or
courts-martial
to
have
jurisdiction
in
this
country,
i
think
that
to
be
the
problem
rather
than
whether
historically,
there
was
such
a
power.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
developed
that
at
some
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
some
length,
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
i
thought
that
the
--
in
the
field
in
the
united
states
would
be
the
only
time
--
i
think
it
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
the
time
of
war
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
have
a
plan
to
try
to
develop
because
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
the
time
of
war
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
there's
a
special
provision
where
congress
has
expressly
recognized
that
only
in
a
very
limited
consideration
in
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
in
the
appendix,
exhibit
a
at
page
82
of
our
reply
brief,
we
have
set
out
something
beyond
the
blumenthal
book
and
that
we
obtained
a
letter
from
mr.
blumenthal
delineating
his
ideas
of
what
his
discoveries
were
in
detail
in
regard
to
the
historical
picture
concerning
these
people
accompanying
the
armed
forces.
generally,
he
finds
that
the
british
forces
were
accompanied
by
women
and
children
in
peacetime
prior
to
the
american
revolutionary
war.
and
this
is
evidenced
in
--
by
several
illustrations.
one
is
that
in
jamaica,
with
the
british
detachments
for
more
than
100
years,
they
had
women
and
not
only
camp
followers,
but
women
who
were
wives
of
the
men
in
the
armed
forces.
and
at
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution,
there
is
a
communication
to
lord
george
germain
ordering
a
detachment
from
jamaica
to
virginia
of
some
374
officers
and
men,
included
also
40
women
and
servants
followed
by
similar
detachments.
he
also
illustrates
it
with
the
example
of
women
in
canada
with
the
british
troops
following
the
capture
of
quebec
in
1763
and
they
reported
there
with
the
british
troops.
and
again,
with
the
french
in
canada
in
the
mid
17th
century
which
this
french
sent
a
regiment
to
canada
for
--
accompanied
by
women
and
that
was
in
peacetime.
and
he
refers
to
a
letter
of
martha
may,
june
4th,
1758
to
colonel
henry
bouquet
from
carlisle,
pennsylvania
which
she
says
that
she's
been
traveling
22
years
with
her
husband
every
place
that
the
company
--
the
company
went.
in
those
days,
of
course,
the
rations
were
issued
uncooked
to
the
troops
but
the
women
performed
the
function
of
cooking
it,
taking
care
of
that
and
also
washing
laundry,
sewing,
nursing
--
nursing
the
--
the
called
back
was
a
very
rough
affair
at
that
time
and
we
didn't
have
the
developments
that
we
do,
did
during
later
period
after
florence
nightingale
in
regard
to
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
also
they
--
they
were
and
there
are
recitals
to
different
events
when
they
were.
the
punishments
were
imposed,
were
often
times
whipping
or
confinement
for
infractions
of
discipline.
there
were
certain
court-martials.
there
were
incidents
described
of
whipping
with
a
cat
o'
nine
tails
at
the
back
of
the
wagons
and
some
of
the
difficulties
they
had
with
drunkenness
and
all
kinds
of
problems
that
are
apparently
inherent
in
such
grouping
activities
and
the
mixture
that
was
necessary
involved
in
trying
to
carry
on
such
activity
are
both
met
in
that
time.
in
the
early
days,
women
with
the
british
in
the
armed
forces
in
the
british
colonial
possessions
were
subject
to
court-martial
in
peacetime
according
to
mr.
blumenthal.
punishment
for
female
drunkenness,
fighting
or
theft
frequently
prior
to
braddock's
campaign
against
the
french
at
fort
ducane
in
peacetime,
numerous
camp
women
were
subject
to
military
jurisdiction.
20
years
before
the
american
revolution,
women
conveyed
--
were
conveyed
from
england
with
braddock's
command
prior
to
the
french
and
indian
war,
1754
to
1760.
it's
also
very
interesting
in
the
description
in
a
good
deal
of
--
of
basic
material
cited
in
all
the
sources,
in
mr.
blumenthal's
book.
but
to
one
of
the
difficulties
that
they
had
was
that
they
would
issue
rations
to
the
armed
forces
for
so
many
men,
so
many
wives
and
women,
and
so
many
children
that
so
much
ahead
the
provision
for
women
and
children,
women
being
different
in
that
from
the
men
and
the
provision
for
the
children
being
different
from
that
for
the
women,
and
they
would
provide
so
many
to
a
regiment
and
they
found
that
they
had
so
many
more
women
and
dependents
along
with
them
than
they
had
contemplated
that
there
was
counts
in
correspondence
back
and
forth
between
the
british
generals
and
other
military
men
trying
to
explain
why
they
were
issuing
more
rations
than
they
had
men
for
and
that
they
were
supposed
to
have
women
and
to
children
for
and
showing
--
relating
in
detail
the
fact
that
they
had
these
additional
women
and
children
along
and
they
have
to
be
taken
care
of.
it
was
part
of
their
problem
and
that
it
took
just
that
much
more
money
and
that
much
more
rations
where
they
were
supposed
to
have
some
10%
of
the
number
of
women
and
children
as
they
did
to
the
armed
--
armed
or
military
men
in
a
certain
unit.
they
would
find
that
they
had
maybe
half
as
many
again
and
they
would
be
trying
to
explain
that
discrepancy
in
the
need
for
the
additional
finances
and
supplies.
and
they
did
that
at
some
considerable
length
in
addition
to
describing
some
of
the
difficulties
of
maintaining
discipline
and
i
don't
want
to
have
to
mislead
the
court
about
whether
these
women
or
wives
or
other
wives
because
it
--
it's
quite
apparent
from
the
description
that
there
were
both.
and
that
in
some
instances,
neither
the
british
or
even
--
it's
implied,
i
think,
some
of
our
people
were
as
too
careful
about
whether
they
were
either
wives
or
camp
followers
because
often
times
it's
related
to
that
they
became
married
during
the
campaign
or
sometime
during
the
period.
but
there
were
people,
women
without
question
during
the
description
in
this
material
who
were
actively
trying
to
help
with
the
conduct
of
the
military
activity.
and
they
were
providing
for
these
men
in
a
way
that
was
done,
men
much
as
women
do
today
and
have
for
as
long
as
we
can
recall.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
only
indication
that
i
could
recall
of
anything
like
that
was
where
it
said
that
at
one
time,
the
women
apparently
were
acting
in
concert
to
try
to
get
us
additional
money,
and
that
they
wanted
a
little
larger
stipend
than
they
were
receiving.
and
he
was
threatening
them
with
a
court-martial
if
they
didn't
proceed
to
accept
what
he
was
offering
and
go
ahead
and
take
care
of
their
men.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
isn't
anything
that
indicates
that
there
was
any
legal
relationship
that
would
obligate
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
beg
you
pardon?
i
thought
they
were
brought
over
here
that
institute
something
like
the
washing
and
hospital
service
for
the
army
and
they
demanded
more
wages
than
they
were
getting
by
working
for
the
government.
he
threatened
them
with
a
--
kind
of
what
you
called
an
injunction
or
something?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
in
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
that
particular
instance.
but
i
didn't
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
connotation
throughout
the
book
that
there's
any
legal
relationship
for
the
british
hired
women
to
do
certain
jobs
or
the
american
expeditionary
force
or
our
revolutionary
force
hired
women
to
do
these.
it
was
a
relationship
that
grew
up
because
the
men
needed
it
and
the
women
went
to
help
them
and
they
were
allocated
on
that
basis,
first
on
the
theory
that
so
many
women,
wives
of
the
men
that
were
going
over
to
this
country
for
the
british
could
perform
the
service
and
then
they
added
to
those,
from
time
to
time,
brought
additional
problems,
and
they
did
do
those
various
things.
now,
there
is
the
difference
that
there
was
the
food
that
was
uncooked
at
that
time
that
there
had
to
be
some
cooking
for
them.
now,
of
course,
there
isn't
any
question
of
what
there's
--
that
function
was
carried
on
but
it's
--
there
is
also
food
provided
with
officers.
there's
a
different
arrangement.
oftentimes,
the
wives
would
cook
in
a
place
on
the
base
for
the
--
the
officer
husband
today
just
like
she
would
do
at
whatever
actively
the
military
were
carrying
on
at
that
time.
so,
there's
a
comparable
situation
about
many
of
the
various
activities,
although
it
might
not
be
identical.
during
this
period
in
colonial
virginia
which
was
of
course
prior
to
the
revolution,
the
british,
the
women
with
the
british
troops
were
subject
to
court-martial
and
court-martial
was
imposed
upon
them.
there's
also
a
description
of
a
large
contingent
of
intended
brides
--
brides
who
were
shipped
from
england
to
jamestown
in
1619,
and
thereafter,
became
related
to
the
military
force
that
was
there,
and
they
were
subject
to
the
military
authority
in
peacetime
as
well
as
during
the
indian
hostilities.
and
in
both
--
in
1620,
in
both
colonial
virginia
and
provincial
maryland,
the
women
were
subject
to
court-martial.
there
was
no
civil
government
in
a
modern
sense
in
those
two
places
during
that
period
of
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
depends
upon
how
you
look
our
history,
i
think,
as
to
whether
we
were
occupied
at
that
time.
the
british
were
holding
out
that
we
were
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
at
1620.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
during
that
very
early
period,
although
we
were
--
it
was
supposed
to
be
colonization
then
and
not
in
occupancy.
and
they
were
supposed
to
be
trying
to
establish
a
colony
on
behalf
of
the
british
government
so
that
it
--
this
--
we
were
supposed
to
be
interested
in
having
a
government
established
in
the
part
of
the
british
commonwealth
rather
than
trying
to
creed
us
as
an
occupied
area
that
they
would
dominate
and
--
like
they
had
conquered
us.
i
think
there's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
[laughs]
the
indians
and
as
soon
as
they
got
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
want
to
engage
in
semantics
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
try
to
answer
the
question
about
treason
briefly
so
that
i
won't
forget
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
conceive
that
the
crime
of
treason
would
have
to
be
tried
in
this
country
for
at
least
before
an
article
iii
court,
because
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
in
regard
to
having
two
witnesses
in
open
court
which
we
believe
would
be
interpreted
to
require
an
article
iii
court
wherein
those
witnesses
would
act.
we
think
that's
the
only
crime
that
would
involve
that
consideration.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there's
a
difference
between
an
article
iii
court
that
i
--
as
--
as
i
was
referring
to,
your
honor,
which
involves
lifetime
tenure
for
the
judge
under
the
requirements
of
the
constitution
where
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
as
being
exercised
and
what
the
court
has
recognized
as
a
legislative
court
which
was
applied
in
the
territories
that
were
not
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
incorporated
that
i
referred
to
and
the
number
of
--
well,
a
court
of
claims
is
another
example,
court
of
customs
in
patent
appeals
is
another
example
of
legislative
courts
where
--
as
distinguished
from
the
article
iii
court
requiring
lifetime
tenures
of
the
judge.
and
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
where
the
trial
is
informed
territory,
the
congress
has
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
provide
for
a
legislative
court
and
not
an
article
iii
court.
but
because
of
the
peculiar
provisions
in
the
constitution
about
treason
where
it
requires
two
witnesses
in
open
court
that
that
would
require
not
a
legislative
court
but
an
article
iii
court
as
a
distinction.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
believe
i
could
answer
that
offhand.
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
the
question
in
the
field
and
in
time
of
war
as
far
as
the
various
articles
in
the
code
are
concerned,
military
code.
but
if
it's
a
question
of
proof
of
treason
as
that
act,
i
think
you'd
have
to
have
an
article
iii
court,
yes.
these
women
of
course
were
not
involved
in
that
crime.
we
say
that
that's
the
only
crime
that
has
that
coverage
by
the
constitution,
and
that
all
other
crimes,
the
congress
has
the
power
to
provide
for
by
a
legislative
court
instead
of
an
article
iii
court
if
it
sees
fit
to
do
so
that
congress
has
the
power
of
properly
choosing
between
the
two.
and
the
only
other
question
is
whether
or
not
it's
inappropriate
and
not
an
unreasonable
choice
is
made.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i'm
trying
to
argue
that,
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
were
not
abandoning
that
ross
doctrine.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that
we
think
the
power
is
--
is
complete
in
that
doctrine
but
in
addition
and
beyond
that
is
the
provision
in
regard
to
the
rules
for
the
government
of
the
article
i,
section
8,
clause
14.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
rest
of
it
was
addressed
to
trying
to
show
that
according
to
the
history
of
common
law,
both
for
britain
and
the
united
states,
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
it
was
conceived
that
under
that
power,
the
congress
would
have
the
--
under
that
provision
of
the
constitution,
that
congress
would
have
the
power
to
provide
for
trial
of
civilian
dependents
and
civilian
employees
in
the
same
manners
it
would
members
of
the
military
corps
themselves.
there
are
number
of
orders
that
are
part
of
the
orders
of
the
british
in
regard
to
these
forces
that
they
had
in
this
country
that
are
referred
to
in
the
blumenthal
book
and
we
set
them
forth
in
footnotes
of
our
brief,
in
page
28
to
our
reply
brief.
and
i
will
not
take
the
time
to
read
them
all
but
they're
dated
in
the
1775
and
1776,
in
that
area
of
time,
and
they
described
time
after
time,
various
regulations
of
the
commanders
in
regard
to
the
women
who
are
associated
with
these
armed
forces
as
well
as
the
settlers
and
other
employees.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
women
at
that
time
or
when
you
--
the
word
camp
follower
was
used
was
not
conceived
as
merely
hangers
on
in
connection
with
the
army
because
it
often
involved
as
described
in
some
of
this
historical
material,
martha
washington
going
to
valley
forge
and
some
of
the
wives
of
the
various
british
commanders
were
over
here
and
wives
of
the
troops
and
commanders
and
officers
throughout,
as
well
as
of
course,
some
of
the
other,
but
it
did
not
have
that
connotation
solely
at
all.
and
there
are
number
of
cases
described
in
our
brief
and
also
in
the
blumenthal
book
in
which
we
got
much
in
the
material
in
regard
to
various
court-martial
actions,
the
various
dates
both
by
the
british
and
the
americans.
and
i'd
like
read
just
briefly
from
the
communication
by
general
washington
with
regard
to
this
matter
that
i
think
evidence
is
the
reason
for
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
and
the
necessity
for
the
discipline
that
was
involved
in
connection
with
it
in
the
handling
of
the
troops
and
trying
to
win
the
revolutionary
war.
“dear
sir,”
he
is
writing
to
the
superintendent
of
finance
of
the
confederation,
trying
to
tell
him
why
he
is
spending
so
much
money
for
all
of
these
various
purposes
including
taking
care
of
the
expenses
for
the
various
dependents
that
are
along
with
the
army.
as
i
never
saw
and
never
heard
of
the
resolve
of
congress
spoken
of
the
secretary
of
war
as
mentioned
in
your
letter
of
the
21st
instance
and
conceive
it
a
right
inherent
with
command
to
limit
as
circumstances
and
the
nature
of
service
may
require
the
proportion
of
women
to
the
men
of
an
army.
i
confess
i
thought
myself
hurt
by
the
interference
of
other
departments
without
any
previous
notice
or
communication
of
sentiments
with
me
on
the
subject.
it
will
appear
by
having
recurrence
to
my
orderly
book
that
an
economical
attention
to
the
public
interest
in
this
case
has
not
been
wanting
but
that
upon
every
return
of
the
number
of
women
called
for
at
different
periods
when
compared
with
the
totality
of
the
army,
it
has
been
found
that
no
general
rule
consisting
with
american
or
british
customs
could
be
established
that
would
not
increase
the
aggregate
amount
of
issues.
and
therefore,
that
it
was
better
to
submit
through
the
surplusage
in
some
course
than
to
render
the
expense
greater
and
the
even
more
extensive
by
adopting
a
limitation
which
would
pervade
the
whole
army.
especially
to
as
some
of
those
corps
were
and
still
are
under
particular
circumstances,
for
instance,
the
regiments
of
new
york
which
in
part
are
composed
of
long
islanders
and
others
who
fled
with
their
families
when
the
enemy
obtained
possession
of
those
places
and
--
and
have
no
other
means
of
subsistence.
the
cries
of
these
women,
the
sufferings
of
their
children
and
the
complaints
of
their
husbands
would
admit
of
no
alternative.
the
latter
with
too
much
justice
remarked,
“if
pay
is
withheld
from
us
and
provisions
from
our
wives
and
children,
we
must
all
starve
together
or
commit
acts
which
may
involve
us
in
ruin.
our
wives
add
they
could
earn
their
rations
but
the
soldier,
navy
officer
for
whom
their
wars
has
not
to
pay
them.
in
a
word,
i
was
obliged
to
give
provisions
to
the
extra
women
in
these
regiments
or
lose
by
desertion,
perhaps
to
the
enemy,
some
of
the
oldest
and
best
soldiers
in
the
service.”
and
then,
there
are
number
of
cases
in
which
it
tells
about
the
difficulties
and
about
the
handling
of
the
dependents,
the
wives
and
other
--
and
the
settlers
in
considerable
detail.
now,
that
as
i
see
it,
demonstrates
the
practical
problem
of
the
armed
services
today
in
trying
to
handle
this
situation.
the
dependents
are
not
sent
overseas
with
these
various
forces
in
63
countries
throughout
the
world
today
for
their
own
placement.
it's
because
of
the
need,
both
in
the
morale
and
assistance
and
aid
to
the
men
in
the
services
that
they
are
included
in
the
manner
that
they
are.
and
it's
a
different
situation,
of
course
these
constitutional
concepts
have
to
be
adjusted
to
changing
times
but
certainly
the
same
basic
reasons
that
are
denoted
in
the
letter
of
judge
--
george
washington
are
involved
in
the
problem
today
of
having
these
people
with
the
armed
services
in
foreign
areas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
there
is
some
difference.
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
that
there
are
broad
powers
in
apparent
piece
in
regard
to
the
preparation
for
war
and
carrying
on
the
necessary
defense
of
the
country.
and
the
ashwander
case
was
one
example
and
there
are
a
number
that
your
honors
are
familiar
with,
i'm
sure.
and
this
is
peace
time
in
many
respects.
and
also,
we
must
have
a
ready
defense
in
these
63
areas
of
the
world
to
have
--
to
meet
any
force
at
any
moment,
and
that's
why
we've
gotten
there.
and
i'm
sure
this
court
recognizes
that
the
combined
judgment
of
the
congress
and
the
executive
that
is
necessary
and
that's
why
it's
being
done.
and
it's
a
part
of
that,
of
the
expense
and
difficulties
that
relate
to
having
the
dependents
of
the
family
there
are
born
by
this
country
because
of
the
need
as
i
conceive
it,
rather
than
because
of
any
desire
or
merely
pleasure
of
these
people
concerned.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
not
at
all.
if
it
was
merely
a
question
of
cost,
well,
that
would
be
in
--
this
court
certainly
shouldn't
give
any
regard
to
it.
there
are
some
problems
in
regard
to
that,
but
i'd
like
to
avert
to
at
this
moment
and
that
is
that
defendant
suggest
that
the
only
answer
to
this
problem
is
to
bring
these
people
back
to
the
united
states
for
trial.
i
think
that's
an
impossible
situation
for
this
country
as
a
sovereign
power
they
have
to
face
in
the
handling
of
this
problem.
if
that's
the
only
alternative,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
an
impossible.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
do
we
say
that
as
far
as
the
government's
concerned?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
defendants
in
their
brief.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
to
bring
them
back.
now,
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
there's
450,000
civilians
that
are
involved
in
this
problem,
both
dependents
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
employees.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
no,
that's
450,000
civilians
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
dependents
are
in
the
areas
where
the
weapons
are.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that's
true,
throughout.
now,
the
problem
you
have
if
you
try
to
constitute
a
jury
and
get
a
grand
jury
and
a
petit
jury
in
--
say
in
england,
that's
the
easiest
example.
would
--
would
this
court
approve
as
due
process
if
it
was
entirely
from
the
group
of
the
military
establishment?
or
would
you
require
that
they
have
to
include
a
part
of
the
community?
and
how
are
we
going
to
be
able
to
exert
the
power
to
get
a
jury
in
a
foreign
country
by
compulsion
from
a
part
of
that
community
so
as
to
have
a
proper
cross-section
constituted
under
the
rules
of
this
court
as
laid
down.
if
you
bring
them
back
to
this
country,
you
have
a
question
of
transportation
expenses
and
so
forth.
but
that
should
not
govern
this
constitutional
question.
however,
it
does
have
a
bearing
in
regard
to
petty
offenses
and
whether
you
are
going
to
have
an
adequate
discipline
in
the
administration
of
your
military
forces
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
--
the
next
question
is
how
are
you
can
ever
handle
your
witnesses
and
the
object.
i'm
sure
that
this
court
would
be
to
try
to
--
to
have
a
fair
trial.
there
is
no
advantage
in
bringing
these
people
back
to
the
united
states
and
have
a
less
fair
trial
than
you
could
have
some
place
else.
and
there
is
no
purpose
certainly.
i'm
sure
in
the
minds
of
this
court
in
having
some
other
kind
of
a
trial
in
saying
congress
should
not
have
the
power
to
do
this
and
have
them
subject
to
court-martial,
and
thereby,
provide
a
less
satisfactory
due
process
trial
than
the
one
you
have.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
say
introduced
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
i
want
to
then
proceed
to
the
problem
of
the
witnesses.
how
are
we
going
to
get
these
witnesses
to
come
back
to
this
country
for
trial?
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
have
had
cases
where
we
have
tried
to
bring
witnesses
back
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
and
we
have
to
give
up
some
important
witnesses
and
we
recently
lost
the
case
that
we
described
in
the
brief
because
witnesses
refused
to
return.
we've
had
to
give
up
prosecutions
because
the
witnesses
would
not
participate
in
a
tax
case
recently
and
the
witnesses
from
italy
that
refused
to
assist
and
come
back
to
this
country
for
a
trial
and
we
have
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
have
that
figure
before
me
but
i'll
try
to
have
it
before
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
--
that
is
correct
and
there
are
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seemed
to
me
in
considering
the
problem,
you
would
want
to
provide
a
method
of
trial
that
would
work
for
more
than
just
one
case
because
of
the
circumstances
that
happened
to
be
in
that
particular
case.
now,
in
the
covert
case
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
reason
i
think
it
can
be
done
satisfactorily,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
witness
has
happened
to
be
in
this
country.
but
if
we
had
to
get
those
witnesses
from
the
foreign
country,
we
would
be
--
unless
they
are
willing
to
come,
which
in
many
cases
they
are
not.
we
have
no
power
of
compulsion
and
we
couldn't
have
a
fair
trial.
and
just
imagine
the
situation
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that's
quite
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
if
you
consider
that
you
have
no
power
of
compulsion
and
that
generally,
the
witnesses
are
away
rather
than
here
you
have
an
entirely
different
situation
from
which
you
do
in
the
state
courts.
they're
all
--
most
of
the
witnesses,
practically,
all
of
them
are
in
the
foreign
area
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed
on
a
foreign
country.
now,
some
of
them
might
be
part
of
the
military
force
or
dependents
and
so
forth
and
be
moved
back
so
that
they
could
--
could
assist
and
participate
in
the
trial
and
even
be
compelled
to
if
they
were
available,
but
that
isn't
true
in
your
status.
ordinarily,
the
crime
occurred
in
the
state
and
most
of
the
witnesses
are
generally
available
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
so
that
you
could
assume
that
most
of
the
time,
you
could
get
a
fair
trial.
but
now,
you
could
imagine
in
this
case,
if
we
were
trying
to
try
them
and
turn
the
facts
around
and
say
we're
trying
to
force
them
to
trial
in
this
country
and
that
they
--
they'd
come
here
and
say,
“we
can't
get
any
of
our
foreign
witnesses
who
can
prove
that
this
women
didn't
commit
the
crime,”
and
we
have
no
power
of
compulsion.
the
government
doesn't
furnishes
anyway
to
bring
them
in.
it
doesn't
have
to,
then
they
would
say,
“we
don't
have
any
kind
of
a
fair
trial,”
and
they
would
be
asking
you
for
a
court-martial.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
not
in
a
criminal
case
to
--
the
government
couldn't.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
a
defendant
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
would
hate
the
--
my
experience
in
trying
cases,
i'd
hate
to
have
to
rely
on
that
in
a
capital
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we
have
some
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
a
little
more
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
parties
have
agreed
that
the
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
but
there
is
no
constitutional
distinction
in
our
controversy
back
and
forth
in
the
briefs.
but
that
doesn't
mean
we
can't
try
to
furnish
the
information
to
you.
we
have
furnished
a
part
of
it,
but
recently,
the
defense
department
furnished
some
further
information
about
this
to
the
congress,
and
we
will
see
that
that
is
also
furnished
in
the
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that
is
correct,
except
for
this
one
caveat,
if
i
may
utter
it
and
that
is
that
the
--
the
fact
that
you
have
so
many
trials
of
offenses
does
not
mean
that
you
might
not
have
a
great
many
more
if
you
didn't
have
any
adequate
means
to
handle
the
problem.
and
if
we
had
to
bring
everybody
back
to
this
country
for
a
trial
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that's
our
argument.
and
we
think
it's
--
it's
very
real
in
this
situation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
she
would.
and
i'm
sure
she
could
have
had
that
kind
of
trial
if
she
wanted
it
at
the
time.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that's
generally
the
case
there
that
the
provision
for
dependents
was
not
generally
made
so
they
don't
have
the
same
problem
there.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
general
considerations
under
the
present
relationship
of
the
three
is
--
are
that
we
should
in
all
cases,
by
direction
of
congress
try
to
have
them
taken
over
by
us,
rather
than
by
the
foreign
country.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
was
in
connection
with
the
approving
of
the
status
of
forces.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
no,
that
was
a
different
--
that
was
an
extraterritorial
court,
something
like
the
consular
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
under
the
status
of
forces
agreements,
they
have
the
power
to
try
the
host
country
--
has
the
power
to
try
american
citizens
for
whatever
crimes
occur
off
the
base.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that
is
the
pattern
all
the
way
through
and
is
also
applied
to
japan.
and
i
assume
it
was
applied
to
morocco,
although
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
particular
situation.
now,
as
to
those
on
the
base,
there
is
a
right
of
the
--
that
involves
americans
in
both
the
individuals
involved
before
the
united
states
to
obtain
the
trial
of
the
crime.
and
congress
by
resolution
has
directed
that
before
we
can,
we
tried
to
obtain
that
benefit
on
the
assumption
or
various
assumptions.
one
of
them
was
they
couldn't
have
a
fair
trial
in
some
of
those
areas,
but
also,
they
are
responding
to
the
problem
they
have
to
deal
with
--
with
their
constituents
who
are
unhappy
with
a
foreign
jurisdiction
that
they're
not
familiar
with.
there's
a
different
language
and
the
penalties
may
be
such
that
are
quite
disturbing,
you'd
know
they
aren't
inflicted
in
a
particular
situation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
we've
tried
to
explain
that.
we
thought
we
did,
and
that
is
when
we
said
that
in
toth
case,
which
i
think
you're
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
speaking
about
that
the
soldier
was
six
months
out
of
the
service
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
then,
if
you
say
that,
then
you
disregard
the
historical
record
of
the
fact
that
the
association
of
women
and
civilian
employees
with
the
armed
forces
since
long
before
this
country
was
established.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
they
tried
both
when
they
had
that
problem.
and
that's
the
history
and
they
did
it
before
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
we
think
that
they
were
so
closely
identified.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
after
he's
six
months
out,
he
just
isn't
identified
at
all.
that's
our
answer
to
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
depends
upon
how
you
fix
the
facts
if
she
really
isn't
a
dependent.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
she's
participating
in
all
of
the
army
in
the
same
ways,
she
then
by
all
of
the
historical
traditions
is
a
part
of
that
military
unit,
even
though
she
happens
to
be
located
right
outside
the
enclave
or
clear
down
in
some
greater
distance.
there
are
so
many
elements
of
the
benefits
and
the
participation
that
she
has
as
a
part
of
the
military
activity.
now,
if
you'd
exclude
her
from
all
of
that,
then
that
would
be
something
else
but
i
don't
think
the
mere
location
across
the
enclave
or
some
miles
away
would
not
change
the
legal
situation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
that
was
a
benefit
to
her.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
that
was
through
during
the
revolutionary
period
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
prior.
they
didn't
all
live
in
the
enclave,
they
lived
in
the
towns.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
true.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
think
it's
automatic.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
use
of
that
power
in
this
manner
is
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
in
relation
to
the
constitutional
power.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
involves
a
question
of
what
kind
of
protections
are
provided,
how
they
are
compared
with
the
protections
historically,
and
whether
the
court
regard
it
as
a
fair
trial
or
due
process.
this
court
has
recognized
court-martials
as
due
process
actions
and
i
don't
think
the
mere
fact
that
you
call
the
court-martial
a
military
court
or
an
x-court
makes
it
constitutional
or
not
constitutional.
it's
a
question
of
what
kind
of
an
exercise
of
power
congress
is
trying
to
make
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
what
the
historical
position
was
with
regard
to
that
whether
it's
exempt,
and
whether
or
not
that
is
a
proper,
reasonable,
and
not
arbitrary,
exercise
to
that
power.
now
you
might
think
that
a
civil
court
of
some
kind
differently
constitutes
without
a
jury
or
a
grand
jury,
was
a
better
idea.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
i
think
congress
has
the
right
once
you
find
the
power
to
exercise
it
under
article
i,
or
under
the
in
re
ross
theory
or
under
the
general
sovereign
power
of
the
united
states
or
under
the
war
power.
if
you
find
the
power
is
there,
then
the
choice
as
long
as
it's
not
unreasonable
arbitrary
ought
to
be
after
the
congress.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
if
you
would
require
that,
there's
no
question
of
what
that
case
would
be
one,
it
would
be
subject
to
court-martial.
the
problem
would
be
from
a
practical
stand
point,
whether
he
could
--
congress
or
the
court
will
wish
to
impose
on
the
defense
establishment
in
necessity
of
forcing
the
woman
into
enlistment
in
order
to
have
her
disciplined
and
have
proper
control
of
the
armed
force.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
reasonable
approached
to
say
that
it's
legal
one
way
and
not
legal
the
other
way
as
far
as
the
desirability.
certainly,
if
she
is
a
member
of
the
armed
forces,
i
think
there
could
be
no
question
about
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
might
be.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
recall
that
we
have
dealt
with
it
just
that
way
but
i'll
be
glad
to
furnish
a
memo
in
that
regard
if
you
like.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
you're
getting
back
then
to
the
question
not
of
power
but
whether
you
think
it's
desirable.
now,
if
that
child
was
tried
in
this
country,
it
could
not
have
a
jury
trial
in
many
states.
it
might
--
it
would
be
required
in
the
federal
court.
it
couldn't
have
12
jurors.
it
couldn't
have
a
grand
jury
indictment,
and
yet,
you'd
say
that
was
perfectly
legal.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
yes
but
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
was
calling
attention
to
is,
this
court
has
approved
in
a
number
of
cases,
the
fact
that
state
--
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
not
required
to
have
12
jurors
like
you
are
required
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
they're
not
required
to
have
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury,
like
you're
required
in
a
federal
court.
and
yet,
that
is
the
kind
of
due
process
that
would
be
--
they
would
receive
in
a
number
of
the
states
in
the
union.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
call
attention
first
to
one
statement
of
defendant's
counsel
that
these
women
in
1789
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
there
is
no
basis
for
any
such
statement
where
a
crime
of
this
character
committed
in
a
foreign
land
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
provision
for
a
jury
trial.
if
they
have
been
tried
in
many
of
the
countries
that
are
involved
in
this
problem
of
the
63
various
locations
where
we
have
our
armed
forces,
there
would
be
no
jury
trial
over
the
laws
of
those
countries.
there
would
be
only
question
that
we
have
here
would
be
only
whether
they
should
be
tried
under
the
laws,
whatever
they
may
be
of
that
foreign
country
or
whether
they
would
be
tried
by
the
provision
that
congress
has
made
for
their
trial
in
court-martial.
there
is
no
question
but
what
in
many
cases
that
character
of
the
trial
if
they
would
be
--
they
would
obtain
by
reason
of
the
request
in
military
to
obtain
jurisdiction
and
have
a
court-martial
would
be
infinitely
more
due
process,
more
of
a
fair
trial
than
they
would
have
in
many
of
the
different
situations.
that
is
not
true
with
regard
to
england.
it's
probably
not
true
in
japan
in
view
of
the
revised
code
of
a
criminal
law
that
they
have.
but
there
is
no
question
under
the
law
at
what
--
at
the
time,
1789
would
be
no
jury
trial
whatsoever
for
these
women
in
foreign
country
by
reason
of
their
american
law.
there
is
a
difficult
problem
in
regard
to
the
question
in
appeal.
and
when
change
occurred
in
our
national
history,
we
believe
from
our
research
that
is
set
forth
in
the
briefs
that
for
a
great
period
of
time,
adds
up
to
about
ex
parte
milligan
in
fact
there
wasn't
any
question
of
what
the
right
to
trial
in
the
field
in
regard
to
dependents
and
employees.
it
was
clearly
recognized,
the
court-martial
under
the
law
of
the
united
states.
we
quote
a
--
an
opinion
by
j.
holt,
the
judge
advocate
general,
november
15th
1866
in
which
he
says,
“it
is
held
by
this
bureau
and
has
been
the
general
usage
of
the
service
in
times
of
peace
that
a
detachment
of
troops
as
an
army
in
the
field
went
on
the
march
for
the
post
remote
from
civil
jurisdiction
and
that
is
the
test.
it
has
been
a
custom
and
is
held
to
be
advisable
that
civil
employees,
settlers
and
camp
followers,
when
guilty
of
crimes
known
to
the
civil
law
to
turn
the
parties
over
to
the
court's
rule
of
sanity
in
which
the
crimes
were
committed.
for
minor
offenses
against
good
orders
and
discipline,
it
has
been
the
custom
to
expel
the
parties
from
the
army.
if
however,
it
is
sought
to
punish
civil
employees
in
new
mexico
for
crimes
committed
at
a
post
where
there
are
no
civil
courts
of
which
--
before
which
they
can
be
tried,
it
is
held
that
they
can
be
brought
to
trial
before
a
general
court-martial
as
they
must
be
considered
as
serving
with
an
army
in
the
field
and
therefore
within
the
provision
of
the
60th
article
war.”
now,
after
ex
parte
milligan,
we
set
forth
the
opinions
of
the
judge
advocate
general.
there
was
a
change
in
the
attitude,
but
that
didn't
change
what
the
practice
and
treatment
was
as
a
matter
of
history
in
the
country
prior
to
that
time,
and
although
that
case
did
not
hold
in
regard
--
had
no
holding
in
regard
to
courts-martial
because
it
dealt
with
the
military
commission,
it
did
nevertheless
cause
the
military
the
judge
advocate
generals
to
take
a
different
position.
but
if
you
examine
what
they
were
considering,
they
were
considering
the
persons
in
charge
of
military
cemeteries,
and
civilian
employees
working
in
connection
with
the
quartermaster,
and
those
were
entirely
different
cases
from
these
questions
involved
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
it
was
generally
recognized
at
that
time
too
that
the
element
that
was
necessary
in
regard
to
civil
jurisdiction
had
four
in
the
field.
that
is
that
there'll
be
no
civil
jurisdiction
available.
it
had
disappeared
throughout
the
country,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
civil
jurisdiction
available
throughout
the
land
and
the
country
had
progressed
to
that
point.
so
that
it
wasn't
possible
after
that
day
to
find
an
area
where
you
had
a
military
force
who
is
out
in
the
field
under
the
definition
and
there
was
no
civil
jurisdiction
available.
we
think
that
in
the
consideration
of
the
question
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
that
the
constitution
of
the
--
the
constitutional
convention,
very
carefully
considered
how
they
can
control
the
military.
and
that
in
developing
the
various
provisions
of
the
constitution,
different
ideas
were
advanced
as
to
how
they
should
be
done.
in
fact,
there
were
different
resolutions
in
which
they
want
to
limit
the
army,
standing
army
to
2000
men
and
all
kinds
of
proposals
because
of
the
abuses
that
they
were
resenting
in
--
at
the
hands
of
the
british.
but
all
of
them
were
rejected
and
it
was
finally
determined
that
the
method
that
would
sound
by
which
to
control
this
problem
of
the
military
was
to
place
it
in
the
hands
of
a
legislature,
of
a
legislative
branch
of
congress
that
would
respond
to
the
will
of
the
people.
and
all
of
the
other
proposals
were
rejected.
but
in
the
explanation
that
hamilton
gave
of
the
reason
for
the
selection
of
the
--
of
that
type
of
control
in
--
in
the
federals,
he
made
it
very
clear
that
the
purpose
was
that
no
one
could
possibly
foresee
all
of
the
problems
and
exigencies
that
a
country
would
face
in
its
defense.
and
therefore,
that
it
should
be
--
the
power
should
be
broadened
up
to
be
adoptable
to
the
various
contingencies
that
might
occur
over
the
years.
and
a
perfect
example
of
that
as
i
see
it
is
the
air
force
where
there
is
no
predictions,
no
provision
of
any
character
in
the
constitution
that
would
contemplate
or
expels
up
the
naval
force,
expels
up
land
forces
that
nobody
referred
in
anyway
to
an
air
force
and
yet
certainly,
it's
--
we
can't
question
of
what
this
military
courts-martial
have
jurisdiction
over
the
air
force.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
references
are
the
land
and
naval
forces,
and
it
didn't
say
anything
about
air
forces
in
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
i
concede
that.
but
i
think
that
that's
--
you
have
to
have
some
--
you
have
to
recognize
the
proper
application
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
in
order
to
cover
the
air
force,
but
it
seems
rather
obvious
to
me
that
it
does.
and
i
certainly,
i'm
not
going
to
stand
before
this
court
and
ever
say
that
once
you
find
a
delegated
authority
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
cannot
be
applied
to
give
this
government
the
power
that's
necessary
and
proper
to
apply.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
go
back
to
the
proposition
that
under
the
article
i,
section
8,
clause
14,
you
have
the
power
and
under
the
history
of
what
the
conditions
were
before
the
constitution
was
adopted,
the
dependents,
civilian
dependents
and
the
civilian
people
who
are
assisting
the
army,
employees,
were
all
considered
a
part
of
that
military
contingent.
and
once
you
--
if
you
recognize
that
as
what
the
history
was
and
that
they
were
court-martialed,
placed
subject
to
those
various
obligations,
orders
and
directions
of
the
military,
then
they
are
part
of
the
military
contingent
and
subject
to
that
law.
that's
where
i
find
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
found
no
place
where
anybody
said
that
they
would
have
that
right.
i
found
that
there
was
the
practice
that
it
got
--
gone
on
for
a
long
period
of
years
in
the
british
troops
as
it
went
out
on
to
some
degree
and
was
common
in
the
american
revolutionary
period.
and
it
was
the
history
of
that
period
out
of
55
members
of
the
constitutional
convention,
35
were
either
officers
or
members
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
part
of
the
revolutionary
army
so
that
i
can't
believe
that
those
people
who
aren't
familiar
with
those
practices
that
were
going
on
all
about
them
in
which
they
are
part
of
it
during
that
period.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
they
wanted
it,
limited
it
to
2000.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
that's
true
but
they
didn't
want
to
leave
this
country
without
any
defense
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
they
had
placed
them
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that's
right,
too.
and
they
thought
the
way
to
protect
them
was
to
place
their
trust
and
confidence
in
the
congress,
the
legislative
body.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
but
they
did
say
it
very
clearly
about
this
general
power
to
regulating
control
