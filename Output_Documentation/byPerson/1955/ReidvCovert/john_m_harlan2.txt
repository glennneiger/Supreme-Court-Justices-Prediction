what
does
impractical
--
impracticable
mean?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
think
would
have
been
the
case
if
these
women
had
been
assigned
to
their
husbands
on
an
american
station,
american
base,
could
they
have
been
court-martialed
under
those
circumstances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
a
continental
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
a
question
to
orient
myself
on
your
argument?
are
you
arguing
now
that
this
jurisdiction
could
be
sustained
independently
of
the
ross
doctrine
that
is
independently
of
the
supreme
opinion
of
this
court
which
is
other
than
the
ross
doctrine?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
--
that's
what
i
understood
that
you
--
after
having
said
what
you
did
at
the
beginning
about
the
ross
doctrine,
everything
else
has
been
on
the
article
i
part.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
oh,
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
article
i
powers
held
to
apply
to
his
dependent,
do
you
think
it
necessarily
follows
that
she
can
be
tried
by
a
court-martial
even
though
one
would
agree
with
your
position
that
she
doesn't
have
to
be
tried
before
a
jury.
in
other
words,
does
it
follow
automatically
from
saying
that
the
article
i
power
exist
if
the
court-martial
jurisdiction
exist,
as
distinguished
from
a
civilian
judge
without
a
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
wiener,
do
you
--
i
understand
the
solicitor
general
to
say
that
it
was
common
ground
between
both
of
you
that
as
far
as
constitutional
power
is
concern
no
distinction
was
to
be
made
between
civilian
employees
of
the
army
and
dependents.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
if
you
had
a
civilian
or
electrician
here
employed
by
the
army,
your
position
would
be
the
same
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
while
the
war
was
on,
could
these
people
have
been
tried
in
england
if
they
had
been
under
court-martial
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
suppose
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
they
could
be?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
english
courts
were
open
and
functioning
all
through
the
war,
all
through
the
bombardment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
they
have
ceded
jurisdiction
to
us?
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
you
go
on
to
that,
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
correct
on
the
thinking
--
in
thinking
that
the
english,
the
british
have
given
court-martial
jurisdiction
recently
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
dependants?
justice
john
m.
harlan
who
organized
that?
