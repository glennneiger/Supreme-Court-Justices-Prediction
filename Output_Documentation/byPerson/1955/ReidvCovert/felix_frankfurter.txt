mr.

was
the
ross

appealed

justice

pardon?

all
i
want

is

justice

(voice

justice

why
not?
justice

mr.
frankel,
i
don't
mean
to
raise
any
question
about
argument
to
the
briefs
of
the
toth
case
but
after
this
question
--
but
because
of
the
important
relevance.
does
not
your
argument
or
does
your
argument
reject
or
imply
that
prosecution
could
be
had
of
toth
under
ross
if
he'd
remained
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
secondly,
if
that
is
so,
for
myself
i
cannot
see
how
the
constitutional
parley
evaporates
simply
because
it
states
for
the
mainland
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
subject
clause
which
begins
to
mean
that
you
must
be
free
under

you
must
not
be
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
foreign
country
and
you're
not
subject
to
the
limitation
if
there's
nothing
against

doing
it
asserted
by

subject
doesn't
mean
the
power
of
the
country
must
give
you
the
permission
which
you
claim
was
established
by
laws
but
you
must
be

not
shackled
by
the
authority
of
a
foreign
country.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
attempted
because
i
don't
see
why
it
passed
or
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
the
case,
i
don't
mean
the
case.
i
mean
the
toth
situation,
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
why
the
use
of
the

i
thought
the
essence
is
what
crime
is
punished,
not
where
you
catch
the
fellow.
justice
felix

well,
he'd
been
still
a
military.
justice

(voice

--
justice

(inaudible)
[laughter]
justice

as
part
of

as

the

of
military
justice.
justice

subject
to
all
that
court-martial
is
applied
and
the

court-martial

the

not

you're
practically
exercising

justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice

frankfurter
but
it
may
well
make
a
difference
if
we'd
have
before
us
a
statute

congress
says
we,
being
these

these

that's
the
precondition

the

upon
which
we
draw
for

justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i
meant
to
say
is
that
the
ross
document,
i
take
it
the
power
of
the
jury
to
revoke
the
ross
power
if
for
instance
with
the
government's
position,
american

will
perform
not
at
all
in
the
employ
of
the
united

at
the
various
stages
(inaudible)
that
the
ross
power
is
extended,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
he
doesn't
have
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
present
--
was
the
present
form
explicit
by
qualifying
it
in
the
field
was
that
in
any
construction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
i
know
if
you
just
--
no,
but
the
--
the
other
part
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
and
i
wanted
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
implies
to
--
which
would
bear
on
antithesis
being
controlled
by
military
or
no
control
at
all.control
by
the
military
is
still
making
part
of
the
control
right
here
in
the
united
states,
is
that
not
true?
the
military
--
the
military
justice
plays
part
of
its
role
here
in
every
case
that
arises
in
a
foreign
country,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
435
figure
for
the
major
countries
or
just
for
england,
mr.
frankel?
justice
felix

in
all
--
in
all
the
countries?
justice

only

a

justice
felix

(inaudible)
justice
felix

i
am
just
saying
they're
ratifying
figures

(voice

justice

well,
i'm
saying
that
those

are
not

the
very
case
to
be
as
(inaudible)
and
happened
to
toth.
justice

they
say
it's
for
the
whole
--
for
the

for

the
major
countries

(voice

justice

maybe
we
ought
to
extend
the
charge
effects
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
frankel's
calling
that
if
in
fact
the
statute
satisfies
or
does
not
offend
the
constitutional
restriction,
the
phrasing
in
which
such
power
is
exercised
is
immaterial
or
indeed
this
act
of
congress
had
--
comes
under
the
military
forces
rather
than
under
broad
power
is
immaterial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
implies
that
it
is
unsustainable,
like
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
giving
an
indictment
with
the
wrong
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
into
--
just
for
the
clear
facts
for
the
provisions
that
you
should
--
and
whatever
it
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me,
page
76?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
wasn't
the
neely
case
a
case
which
raised
the
question
whether
a
crime
against
cuba,
neely
was
charged
with
demeanor
crime
against
cuba
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
--
it
extradited
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
a
question
of
this
country
prosecuting
for
a
crime
against
it
in
cuba
by
a
tribunal
other
than
an
article
iii
tribunal,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
--
i
beg
your
pardon
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
you
answer
to
chief
justice,
you
indicated
that
as
to
these
cantonment
wives,
they're
not
swept
into
the
court-martial
area
except
when
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
went
in
the
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
just
don't
get
it.
but
what
is
in
the
field
in
that
--
in
that
context
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
didn't
mean
generally
--
i
didn't
mean
generally,
but
i
was
wondering
whether
taking
the
cantonment
women
out.
could
the
statute
or
the
regulation,
whatever
that
does
it,
use
the
word
"in
the
fields?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
certainly
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
are
--
i
assume
you
are
coming
to
"in
the
field"
but
i
was
wondering
whether
in
that
situation,
congress
itself
has
defined
it
refusing
it
applies
to
war?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
some
figures
in
the
government's
original
brief,
i
believe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
of
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
we
don't
need
these
figures
but
there
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
were
those
figures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
civilians,
generally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
intervene
merely
to
suggest
that
the
figures
you
did
give
of
the
total
was
what
might
be
called
very
--
not
a
sizable
problem
under
serious
offenses,
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they'd
go
on
--
they'd
be
stimulated
to
commit
major
crimes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
you
whether
there
are
any
general
considerations,
either
formulated
or
acted
upon
which
lead
the
government
to
let
the
host
country
to
try
taking
instead
of
letting
--
having
them
taken
over
by
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
that
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
direction
--
how
was
that
manifested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
speeches
in
the
congress
in
which
they
were
quite
outright
that
an
american
should
be
--
when
he
commits
a
crime
abroad,
he
should
be
tried
by
that
country
which
presumably
some
of
the
speakers
indicated
are
all
barbaric
codes.
some
of
the
speeches
in
congress
make
one
wonder
where
this
men
really
lives
as
in
talking
that
way
about
western
union
prudence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
that
means
is
that
if
england
in
response
to
its
public
opinion,
things
that
murders
committed
by
american
civilians
living
at
the
hotel
savoy
should
be
tried
at
the
old
bailey,
they
may
stand
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
to
that,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
whether
assuming
everything
you
say
so
that
these
are
--
they
haven't
the
status.
they're
not
part
of
the
armed
force.
what
of
the
doctrine
that
is
often
resorted
to
or
what
are
the
considerations
in
constitutional
construction
that
you
may
sweep
into
an
exercise
of
power
to
some
--
a
number
of
situations
that
are
not
explicitly
within
the
granted
power
in
order
to
give
effectiveness
to
the
granted
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
prove
it,
but
it
was
so
clear
that
no
question
would
be
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
wasn't
much
in
1916?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
of
the
organic
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
the
military
code
provide
in
regard
to
publicity
of
a
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
that's
merely
administrative.
that's
determined
by
the
code.
i
mean,
is
it
statutorily
or
may
the
person
change
it,
the
commander-in-chief?
