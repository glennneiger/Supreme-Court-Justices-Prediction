mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
court
please.
the
basic
question
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
power
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
is
the
power
to
try
by
court-martial
the
wives
of
members
of
those
forces.
but
before
i
can
reach
that
issue,
i
must,
in
compliance
with
the
rule,
address
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
problem
in
number
701.
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
curtis
reid
was
an
--
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
not
of
the
united
states
and
that
this
distinction
is
well
recognized
by
judicial
and
administrative
decisions
and
preeminently
by
many,
many
sections
of
the
u.s.
code,
i
found
about
40
of
them
just
glancing
at
the
index
there
in
the
brief.
it
is
also
perfectly
clear
that
although
curtis
reid
is
the
keeper
of
the
united
states
so
that
he
can
bind
the
united
states
just
as
any
state
custodian
holding
a
federal
prisoner
would
be,
the
statute
speaks
only
of
officer
and
employee.
it
is
further
clear
that
agency
is
defined
for
purposes
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
not
generally
as
of
course
every
municipality
as
an
agency
of
its
superior
sovereignty,
it
is
very
specifically
defined
so
as
to
exclude
the
district
of
columbia.
and
the
proof
that
the
district
of
columbia
couldn't
have
been
included
as
an
agency
within
the
meaning
of
title
28
is
in
the
witness
fee
provisions
and
basically
the
witness
fee
provision
is
that
if
anyone
is
an
employee
of
the
united
states,
he
doesn't
draw
to
get
the
subpoena
money,
the
witness
fee
in
addition
to
itself.
and
this
is
what
1823
(b)
said.
and
now,
we'll
ask
your
honors
to
consider
in
the
light
of
this
section,
it's
quite
short
and
i'll
read
it.
consider
how
the
district
of
columbia
could
possibly
be
an
agency
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
1252.
it's
on
page
17
of
the
white
brief,
“employees
of
the
united
states
or
an
agency
thereof
in
active
service,
called
as
witnesses
on
behalf
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
any
judicial
proceeding
in
which
the
government
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
party
shall
not
be
paid
witness
fees.”
well,
that
section
would
be
sheer
unadulterated
nonsense
if
the
district
of
columbia
were
an
agency
of
the
united
states
within
title
28.
so
that
we
submit
that
the
appeal
in
701
must
be
dismissed.
now,
in
701
there
is
a
non-constitutional
issue
which
i
would
be
bound
to
discuss
ahead
of
the
constitutional
issue
but
for
one
thing
and
that
is
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
the
only
one
in
713,
therefore
if
713
is
decided
adversely
to
the
government,
it
disposes
of
701
that
if
only
the
jurisdictional
point
is
--
if
--
if
the
appeal
is
dismissed,
if
the
constitutional
issue
is
decided
adversely
to
these
wives
then
the
district
--
the
court
of
appeals
to
which
an
appeal
was
taken,
but
which
under
the
last
sentence
of
1252
is
here,
can
on
the
remand
consider
that
non-constitutional
issue
and
of
course
i
have
in
mind
also
the
rather
unprecedented
lateness
of
the
hour
which
all
but
suggest
the
old
days
when
it
was
the
jurors
and
not
the
judges
who
were
kept
together
without
food
or
drink
until
they
arrive
with
the
decision.
now,
on
the
basic
issue
of
the
constitutional
validity
of
2
(11),
the
government
has
taken
three
positions.
first,
it
argued
it
in
the
district
courts
with
the
question
of
the
court-martial
policy.
and
then
when
it
came
here,
it
argued
it
as
an
aspect
of
the
treaty
power
and
now
in
the
reply
brief,
it
says,
“well,
we've
written
60
treaties
on
the
assumption
that
we
have
the
power,
so
please
don't
upset
our
assumptions
that
we'll
have
to
renegotiate
which
is
a
new
form
of
confession
of
error.”
now,
i
will
take
up
those
three
positions
(inaudible)
the
government's
first
position
was
that
a
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
all
accompanying
civilians
was
traditional
and
in
the
briefs
we
were
treated
to
a
historical
novel
that
--
that
began
with
the
emperor
maximilian
who
was
the
contemporary
of
columbus,
continued
through
the
articles
of
james
ii,
i
bring
the
exponent
to
the
liberties
of
the
subject
and
went
through
the
bloodied
snows
of
valley
porch
down
to
the
present
time.
faced,
however,
with
the
authorities
which
have
unfortunately
made
this
brief
rather
more
voluminous
than
i
would've
like
to
have
it,
the
government
takes
a
new
date
and
point
from
its
--
for
its
historical
excursions
and
that's
1916
because
up
to
1916,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
traditional
american
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
a
civilian
was
limited
to
those
who
in
time
of
war
accompanied
the
armies
in
the
field
and
that
was
the
scope
whether
the
person
was
a
relative
and
a
matching
(inaudible)
they
said
they
didn't
find
any
such
trial
or
whether
the
accompanying
civilian
was
functionally
connected
with
the
forces
like
the
contract
is
in
the
old
post
traders.
and
there
just
isn't
any
question
about
it
and
when
we
got
--
when
the
judge
advocate
general
and
the
attorney
general
dealt
within
the
field,
both
in
the
--
in
a
classical
period
defined
that
very
narrowly
as
meaning
an
area
where
military
operations
were
in
progress.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
the
first
world
war
under
what
appears
to
be
the
influence
of
great
martial
zeal,
places
in
the
united
states
were
considered
to
be
in
time
of
--
to
be
in
the
field.
i
don't
consider
--
i
don't
understand
that
the
citations
of
some
of
those
cases
in
the
duncan
versus
kahanamoku
at
a
portion
of
the
text
where
the
court
says
this
is
not
what
we're
considering,
we're
not
considering
this
situation
implies
their
approval.
i
don't
concede
for
one
minute,
as
my
brother
appears
to
understand,
that
those
were
an
exercise
of
the
war
power.
they
weren't.
i
don't
concede
for
a
minute
that
they
were
rightly
decided
but
the
point
is
that
up
to
1916
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
in
anybody's
mind,
the
power
to
court-martial
a
civilian,
it
was
limited
to
those
in
time
of
war
accompanied
the
armies
in
the
field
that
is
where
military
operation
were
in
progress.
and
anytime
--
anytime
any
extension
of
that
jurisdiction
was
sought,
it
was
always
considered
unconstitutional.
it
was
considered
unconstitutional
by
colonel
winthrop,
whose
old-fashioned
views
are
receiving
the
approval
of
20th
century
this
court
in
the
20th
century.
it
was
always
considered
unconstitutional
by
the
judge
advocate
general
in
published
opinions
over
a
40-year
period
and
i
suggest
that
this
might
be
an
appropriate
opportunity
to
apply
the
rule
enunciated
by
your
honors
that
in
the
field
of
military
law,
the
opinions
of
the
judge
advocate
general
are
entitled
to
some
weight.
so
that
for
a
period
of
over
a
140
years
from
1775
to
1916,
content
and
substance
was
given
to
clause
14
and
we
know
what
in
the
minds
of
--
of
military
lawyers,
of
military
men,
of
civilian
judges,
the
land
and
naval
forces
meant.
and
it
is
also
a
fact
and
it
is
not
disputed
that
for
a
175
years
from
1775
to
1950,
no
american
wife
was
ever
tried
by
an
american
court-martial.
and
that
brings
us
to
1916
which
is
the
government's
correct
new
date
and
point
for
its
history
and
that
was
when
the
present
jurisdiction
was
first
asserted.
and
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
that
in
the
hearings
on
the
1916
articles
of
war,
general
crowder's
presentation
doesn't
mention
a
historical
problem
at
all
and
as
far
as
one
can
ascertain
from
what
he
said,
what
the
point
that
waived
particularly
on
his
mind
was
that
in
the
second
cuban
intervention,
a
peeving
quartermaster
clerk
had
escaped
punishment
because
he
was
included
within
a
cuban
amnesty
proclamation.
but
not
a
word
was
said
at
the
earlier
precedence,
congress
wasn't
told,
there
wasn't
a
word
in
the
hearings
or
in
the
debates
that
there
was
a
constitutional
question.
it
passed
without
question
none
of
the
war
--
world
war
i
cases
involved
this
extension.
that
the
world
war
i
cases
involved
simply
the
scope
of
in
the
field
and
it
was
not
until
1941
that
the
over
--
at
the
atlantic
basis
under
the
destroyer
(inaudible),
it
was
not
until
then
that
a
civilian
was
ever
tried
by
an
american
court-martial
in
time
of
peace
with
the
approval
of
higher
authority.
so
that
the
tradition
which
the
government
invoked
in
its
brief
is
of
only
15
years'
standing
and
i
can't
help
being
reminded
of
the
freshwater
college
that
was
trying
to
inch
into
the
ivy
league,
announcing
that,
“it
was
traditional
here
that
freshmen
will
uncover
as
they
cross
the
memorial
quadrangle.
this
tradition
began
last
monday.”
the
tradition
of
trying
civilians
by
court-martial
in
time
of
peace
in
the
american
service
is
only
15
years
old
and
through
--
well
into
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
a
compilation
in
june
of
1945,
every
civilian
who
had
been
tried
by
court-martial
--
by
american
court-martial
since
the
civil
war
when
they
first
had
a
judge
advocate
general
was
all
--
was
functionally
connected
with
the
forces
and
there
wasn't
a
single
case
of
a
wife
or
any
other
defendant
tried
by
a
court-martial.
and
then
again
we
get
to
1949
and
1950.
we
have
this
voluminous
volume
which
is
a
hearing
and
the
reports,
the
legislative
history
of
the
uniform
code,
there
were
floor
debates
also.
in
all
of
that
material,
there
isn't
a
whisper
of
a
question,
there
isn't
an
assertion,
there
isn't
--
well,
i
don't
know.
there
isn't
even
that
as
to
whether
2
(11)
was
constitutional,
all
they
supposed
is
that
they
were
carrying
forward
2
(d)
with
perhaps
a
little
texture
or
revision.
but
nobody
raised
any
constitutional
question
and
nobody
expressed
a
constitutional
doubt
so
that
the
--
the
basic
issue
which
is
now
before
your
honors
wasn't
even
whispered.
and
it
is
these
cases
which
for
the
first
time
raised
this
question.
now,
we
think
--
we
think
that
toth
controls,
that's
what
judge
tamm
in
701,
because
toth
laid
down
three
propositions
and
the
first
one
was
that
the
fifth
amendment
wasn't
a
source
of
military
jurisdiction.
i've
covered
that
in
the
brief,
i
shall
through
the
elliot's
debates
but
that
is
the
historically
correct
interpretation.
my
brother
frankel
quoted
me
to
the
contrary.
i
think
it's
in
the
book
of
joe,
although
my
desire
is
that
my
adversary
had
written
a
book
along
with
the
lower
federal
courts
for
80
years,
along
with
the
manual
for
courts-martial
for
60
years,
i
assume
that
the
fifth
amendment
was
a
source
of
military
jurisdiction.
and
as
mr.
frankel
pointed
out,
it
didn't
take
me
more
than
10
days
to
revise
my
view.
so
the
test
is
not
whether
the
case
arises
in
the
land
and
naval
forces.
the
test
is
rather
the
second
toth
proposition
that
to
justify
trial
by
court-martial
the
person
sought
to
be
affected
must
be
either
a
member
or
a
part
of
the
armed
forces
and
third
that
the
content
of
clause
14
in
the
court-martial
clause
is
not
to
be
enlarged
by
anything
in
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
and
on
that
proposition
that
toth
controlled,
again,
mr.
frankel
and
i
were
in
accord
and
if
i
may
read
his
very
excellent
toth
brief,
what
is
now
known
in
the
--
among
the
article
2
(11)
bar
as
the
frankel
footnote,
indeed
we
think
the
constitutional
case
is
of
anything
clearer
for
the
court-martial
of
toth,
who
was
a
soldier
at
the
time
of
his
offense
than
it
is
for
a
civilian
accompanying
the
forces.
and
so,
i
agree
with
my
brother
that
toth
is
a
fortiori
and
that
it
controls
this
case.
and
then
--
then
we
--
we
come
to
what
is
on
analysis
really
the
heart
of
this
problem.
now,
of
course
it's
conceived
that
the
wives
of
members
of
the
armed
forces
in
this
country
cannot
be
tried
by
court-martial.
and
so,
the
question
is
why
is
there
greater
power
overseas?
and
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
the
very
tangled
and
disputed
ground
over
whether
the
sixth
amendment
applies
ex
proprio
vigore
overseas.
although,
i
must
say
it
is
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
understand
why
the
basic
instrument,
including
the
part
that
makes
the
president
in
commander-in-chief
is
deemed
available
for
export
so
as
to
permit
our
armed
forces
to
operate
overseas
whereas
the
procedural
and
other
guarantees
of
the
bill
of
rights
must
somehow
stop
at
the
waters
end.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
into
that
for
this
reason.
plainly,
the
sixth
amendment
and
article
3,
section
2
is
both
guaranteeing
a
trial
by
jury
apply
in
the
united
states.
now,
seated
about
this
courtroom
are
gentlemen
in
uniform
who
are
undoubtedly
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial
in
the
united
states
where
the
sixth
amendment
is
offered.
i
don't
suggest
that
these
particular
individuals
will
ever
be
accused
before
a
courtroom,
but
they
are
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial
and
if
they
were
on
trial
they
couldn't
for
one
minute
invoke
the
sixth
amendment
and
--
and
insist
on
the
jury
because
they
are
members
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
and
clause
14
means
that
members
of
the
land
and
navel
forces
may
be
tried
by
court-martial.
so
it
isn't
where,
it
is
who.
if
you're
in
uniform
in
the
united
states,
you're
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial,
if
you're
not
in
uniform,
you
are
not
living
out
of
force
in
the
war,
in
the
field,
possibly
martial
law.
so
that
the
question
being
who
and
having
175
years
of
construction
of
clause
14
as
not
including
why,
it
is
our
position
that
the
content
of
clause
14
is
not
broadened
or
enlarged
once
the
transport
bearing
the
wives
passes
the
three
mile
limit
or
perhaps
the
continental
ship.
and
we
say
that
the
women
or
the
wives
overseas
are
no
more
part
of
the
armed
forces
there
than
they
are
here.
they're
no
more
intimately
connected
with
the
forces
there
than
they
are
here.
oh,
says
my
brother
frankel
disciplinary
problems,
traffic
violations,
narcotics
and
black
market.
we
have
the
same
problems
on
every
army,
navy
and
air
force
installation
in
the
united
states.
somebody
has
to
control
the
wives
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
try
them
by
court-martial
and
i
put
to
one
side
as
completely
irrelevant
the
fact
that
they
can
get
pre-medical
assistance
from
the
military
medical
authorities
that
they
live
in
public
quarters
that
they
get
commissary
and
post-exchange
privileges,
emoluments
don't
confer
jurisdiction
and
i
take
it
that
these
women
did
not
sell
their
constitutional
birthright
for
a
mess
of
commissary
partnership.
now,
it
is
said
well
they're
overseas
--
they're
overseas,
they
affect
foreign
relations,
they
affect
the
continued
acceptability
of
our
forces
to
the
host
government.
but
that's
true
of
other
americans
overseas.
as
nearly
as
i
could
break
down
the
figures
furnished
by
the
committee
on
government
operations
which
are
in
the
brief,
we
have
almost
as
many
if
perhaps
not
more
civilian
employees
of
the
united
states
of
non-department
of
defense
overseas
then
we
have
department
of
defense
employee.
and
i
suppose
that
a
great
many
of
those
are
accompanied
by
their
dependents
and
true
they
don't
live
on
military
post
but
then
a
great
many
military
personnel
in
the
nato
countries
don't
live
in
military
quarters
and
that's
one
of
the
causes
of
unhappiness
over
there.
now,
those
persons
by
misconduct
could
affect
american.
then
the
dependents
have
children
if
the
dependent
wives
are
part
of
the
armed
forces
as
the
government
contends
are
the
adolescent,
they
misbehave,
the
mixed-up
teenage
children
who
commit
offenses,
aren't
they
similarly
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial?
every
week,
one
reads
in
the
public
crest
of
some
minor
from
20
and
a
half
down
to
11
committing
a
homicide.
very
unfortunate
but
we
know
what
happened.
if
the
--
those
children
do
that
overseas
and
they
are
the
children
of
servicemen,
are
they
going
to
be
tried
by
court-martial?
the
government's
arguments
are
broadened
up
to
reach
it
and
what
about
tourists,
it's
perfectly
possible
and
it
isn't
at
all
imaginary
to
suppose
that
a
tourist,
american
tourist
abroad
may
adversely
affect
the
american
position.
consider
some
country
that
we
wish
very
much
to
get
into
our
orbit
of
alliances.
tourists
are
there,
the
--
the
historic
shrine
revered
by
the
inhabitants
and
a
couple
of
american
tourists
go
there
in
shorts,
the
country
is
outraged,
the
editorial
scream,
the
consulate
is
stoned
and
the
country
doesn't
sign
a
defense
pack
with
it.
are
you
going
to
try
the
tourist
by
court-martial
for
wearing
improper
uniform
just
as
(inaudible)
now,
this
is
not
an
occupied
territory
case
and
that
requires
me
to
elucidate
some
of
the
fundamentals
about
the
occupied
territory
cases.
in
the
first
place,
when
the
united
states
occupies
military
--
military
--
enemy
territory,
it
operates
under
the
war
power
and
by
the
right
of
contrast.
madsen
versus
kinsella
was
such
a
case.
the
only
novelty
really
in
madsen
v.
kinsella
is
that
the
military
government
tribunal
was
appointed
by
a
civilian
high
commissioner
instead
of
by
a
commanding
general.
madsen
v.
kinsella
was
not
a
trial
by
a
court-martial.
it
was
a
trial
by
a
military
court.
now,
there
was
a
dictum
saying
there
was
confirmed
jurisdiction
in
the
court-martial
and
so
there
was
because
ever
since
1916
under
old
article
12,
a.w.
12
and
the
present
article
18,
a
general
court-martial
has
military
government
powers
and
therefore
sitting
an
occupied
territory
it
can
try,
it
happens
and
that
was
the
only
meaning
of
the
dictum
in
madsen
against
kinsella,
although
i
must
point
out
that
the
issue
wasn't
contested.
and
i
may
say
that
this
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
general
court-martial
in
occupied
territory
is
not
mentioned
in
the
government
briefs.
now,
that
--
that
was
war
power
because
occupation
rests
on
war
power
where,
however
--
where,
however,
the
person
tried
is
in
time
of
war
in
the
field
in
the
united
states
as
in
the
--
what
is
now
known
as
the
confederate
war
to
avoid
arousing
anyone's
sensibility
or
has
happened
in
the
undeclared
indian
wars
and
on
the
theaters
of
those
wars,
that
is
in
the
field,
it
is
not
the
war
power.
and
to
analogize
this
situation
here
in
japan
after
the
treaty
of
peace
and
in
england,
in
mrs.
covert's
case
to
the
occupied
territory
cases
is
simply
wrong.
then
i
may
say,
your
honor,
that
if
mrs.
smith
had
been
tried
before
the
treaty
of
peace
with
japan
went
into
effect,
if
we
would
never
have
brought
the
proceeding
because
then
the
jurisdiction
couldn't
have
been
questioned.
but
to
say
that
this
--
that
--
that
the
war
power
covers
these
situations,
i
think
if
this
were
a
patent
case,
i
should
have
to
concede
priority
of
invention
but
that
would
be
its
only
memory.
now,
we
come
to
the
ross
case.
i
think
there
is
some
difference
between
this,
between
the
parties
as
to
the
present
validity
of
the
ross
case
but
that
interesting
speculation
need
not
be
pursued
because
this
is
not
a
consular
court.
this
is
a
court-martial
and
a
court-martial's
powers
are
limited
to
those
who
are
members
--
to
try
those
who
are
members
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
and
that
power
doesn't
expand
when
you
get
overseas
and
to
--
to
suggest
that
women
are
part
of
the
armed
forces.
well,
even
judge
moore
couldn't
--
couldn't
buy
that.
now,
this
business
of
discipline,
here
is
what
the
government
told
the
court
only
four
years
ago
in
madsen
against
kinsella,
compare
this
with
the
impassioned
reply
brief
as
to
the
necessity
for
disciplining
wives.
the
compelling
reasons
of
policy
which
precludes
subjecting
soldiers
of
the
occupying
forces
to
the
law
and
the
tribunals
of
the
occupied
territory
have
much
less
weight
when
applied
to
civilians
of
the
occupying
power,
particularly
those
such
as
soldier's
dependents
who
bear
no
functional
relationship
to
the
occupying
troupes.
now,
i
ask
what
has
happened
in
four
short
years
to
make
it
so
necessary
to
discipline
the
wife.
and
i
say
it's
only
a
question
of
disciplining
the
wife,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
disciplining
the
service
--
the
situation
so
far
as
the
discipline
of
the
troupes
is
concerned
would
have
been
the
same
as
if
a
bystander
had
killed
these
people.
so
i
say,
i
suggest,
that
it
would
be
much
better
for
the
air
force
to
devote
its
very
considerable
talents
to
the
material
and
terrific
problem
of
maintaining
our
air
supremacy,
in
a
word,
of
sticking
to
the
wild
blue
yonder,
instead
of
trying
civilian
women
by
court-martial.
now,
i
take
up
the
government's
second
position
which
was
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
think
that
when
you
have
a
--
a
mass
of
legislative
history
such
as
you
have
on
the
uniform
code
and
when
no
one
has
said
a
word
about
it
but
when
the
code
has
been
considered
by
the
committees
on
--
in
the
armed
services,
not
by
the
committees
on
foreign
affairs
and
foreign
relation,
i
think
it's
a
pretty
clear
indication
that
congress
was
acting
under
clause
14
and
wasn't
thinking
of
the
treaty.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
i
will
--
i
will
now
address
myself
to
that
point
and
show
that
it
is
unsustainable
because
after
all
it
has
applied
to
the
covert
case,
if
the
court
please.
the
proposition
is
that
the
treaty
power
authorizes
the
trial
by
court-martial
of
a
civilian
woman
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
how
can
the
treaty
possibly
reach
that?
but
let
us
see
first
what
is
involved
in
this
invocation
of
the
treaty
power.
very
obviously,
if
the
clause
14
power
is
adequate,
it
is
not
necessary
to
talk
about
treaty
power.
therefore,
the
treaty
power
is
being
invoked
because
the
clause
14
power
is
inadequate.
it
is
inadequate
because
these
persons
have
a
right
to
trial
by
juror
and,
therefore,
the
treaty
power
is
invoked
to
deprive
them
of
that
right.
now,
that
argument,
of
course,
is
an
afterthought,
it's
an
afterthought
as
shown
by
the
pleadings,
it's
an
afterthought
as
shown
by
the
legislative
history
and
preeminently
it
is
an
afterthought
as
shown
by
the
practice.
i
have
cited
some
cases
in
the
brief
where
the
treaty
power
couldn't
possibly
have
been
invoked
as
a
british
woman,
a
british
subject
in
alderson
today
under
her
life
sentence.
she
was
tried
by
an
american
court-martial
sitting
in
asmara,
eritrea.
she
was
an
excludable
alien
because
she
was
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
they
took
the
attorney
general's
parole
to
let
her
into
alderson.
the
british
had
jurisdiction
because
under
british
law,
a
british
subject
guilty
of
a
homicide
anywhere
in
the
world
is
triable
in
a
british
court.
what
aspect
of
the
treaty
power
has
put
--
inured
that
woman
in
alderson
for
the
rest
of
her
life?
now,
let's
consider
the
--
the
so-called
treaties
that
are
invoked
because
it's
always
well
to
be
reasonably
specific.
the
--
in
the
covert
case,
it's
the
visiting
forces
act
and
section
2
(1)
of
that
act
says,
“all
persons
who
are,
by
the
law
of
the
u.s.a.
for
the
time
being,
subject
to
the
military
or
naval
law
of
that
country
shall
be
deemed
to
be
members
of
said
forces.”
well,
that
begs
the
question
whether
mrs.
covert
was
subject
to
military
law
because
i
take
it
that
the
law
of
that
country,
meaning
the
law
of
the
united
states
does
not
exclude
the
law
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
in
the
administrative
agreement
with
japan,
which
is
involved
in
the
krueger
case,
there
was
a
section
that
said
we
represent
that
our
service
courts
are
ready,
willing
and
able
to
try
these
people.
i
think
it
would
have
surprised
the
signatories
of
that
agreement
if
they
have
thought
that
they
were
thereby
extending
beyond
what
would
otherwise
be
the
limits,
the
jurisdiction
of
american
courts-martial.
i
think
that
fairly
construe
article
17
(4)
of
that
agreement
means
we
will
exercise
our
jurisdiction
vigorously
and
honestly,
and
we
won't
turn
loose
without
a
trial
of
these
people
about
whom
you
complain
simply
because
they're
victims
or
nationals
of
the
former
enemy.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
in
the
government's
brief
in
701
at
page
76.
it's
section
2
(1)
of
the
visiting
forces
act.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
76
of
the
government's
brief
in
701.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
but
if
we
can
assume
that
these
agreements
purported
to
enlarge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
american
courts-martial
then
we
have
this
situation
that
as
applied
to
the
covert
case,
a
woman
in
the
district
of
columbia
who
normally
could
claim
her
double
--
constitutional
guarantee
of
jury
trial
is
by
reason
of
the
act
of
a
foreign
parliament
following
an
executive
agreement
which
doesn't
mention
women
deprived
of
that
right
to
a
jury
trial
right
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
and
of
that
i
say,
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
grier,
on
the
last
page
of
the
24th
of
howard,
haud
equidem
invideo,
mirror
magis.
it
is
not
so
much
that
i
am
angry,
but
rather
that
i
marvel
at
it.
now,
in
the
japanese
situation,
if
again
that
is
be
--
to
be
construed
as
enlarging
the
jurisdiction
of
american
courts-martial
beyond
what
it
would
have
been
had
there
not
been
such
an
agreement,
then
you
have
a
square
conflict
between
the
executive
agreement
and
the
bill
of
rights.
now,
there
are,
of
course,
cases
here
that
say
you
can't
do
that
and
only
at
the
last
term
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
government
told
this
court
together
with
statutes
and
treaties,
executive
agreements
are
subject
to
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
other
clauses
of
the
constitution
which
protect
all
americans
from
the
excesses
of
official
authority.
now,
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
that
is
a
bit
of
constitutional
doctrine
too
fundamental
to
change
from
term
to
term
in
each
passing
case.
it's
far
too
basic
to
be
treated
like
an
automobile
that
you
trade
in
for
a
new
model
every
year.
now,
i
come
to
the
government's
third
proposition,
namely,
the
claim
that
they
have
nato-like
treaties
with
some
60
countries,
which
they'll
have
to
renegotiate
if
they're
wrong
on
article
2
(11).
now,
the
basic
article
1s
7
(1)
(a)
on
page
35
of
the
government's
reply
brief
and
this
is
what
it
says,
“the
military
authorities
of
the
sending
state,”
which
means
the
united
states,
“shall
have
the
right
to
exercise
within
the
receiving
state,”
that
is
the
nato
countries,
“all
criminal
and
disciplinary
jurisdiction
conferred
on
them
by
the
law
of
the
sending
state
over
all
persons
subject
to
the
military
law
of
that
state.”
now,
how
does
that
enlarge
american
military
power?
is
--
is
it
--
is
it
--
the
government
says
there
is,
of
course,
no
question
that
the
appellee
is
within
the
terms
of
article
2
(11)
and
in
this
sense
subject
to
american
military
law.
i
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
that
is
question
begging.
that
is
--
that
is
bootstrapped
because
if
--
if
under
the
constitution,
2
(11)
is
not
valid
then
certainly
these
treaties,
even
though
there
maybe
60
of
them,
don't
enlarge.
i
submit
that
is
an
argument
of
desperation.
but
it's
more
serious
than
that.
it's
much
more
serious
than
just
two
cases
that
the
government
feels
it's
losing
so
much
so
that
they
filed
a
district
court
opinion
on
the
same
issue
rendered
only
last
week
whether
that's
like
picketing
the
courthouse
or
--
or
tabulating
(inaudible)
or
perhaps
a
little
of
both
might
be
the
same.
but
this
contention
that
we're
not
going
to
renegotiate
treaties
and
that
the
court-martial
power
is
going
to
be
enlarged
and
the
right
to
jury
trial
curtailed
by
reason
of
treaty
seems
to
me
a
very
dangerous
argument.
now,
there
are
people
who
for
the
past
10
years
have
been
urging
a
curve
on
the
treaty
power
and
an
amendment
to
the
supremacy
clause
which
would
reduce
us
from
potentially
the
most
powerful
nation
in
the
world
to
an
impotent
league
of
48
separate
states
unable
to
speak
with
a
single
voice
in
the
world.
but
nothing
that
the
proponents
of
the
treaty
power
limitations
have
dreamed
up
in
their
most
insomniac
dyspeptic
hour
is
anything
near
as
fantastic
as
the
proposition
that
is
advanced
here
in
apparent
seriousness
that
because
of
the
treaty
power
you
can
try
a
civilian
woman
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
the
toth
case
says
that
the
court-martial
power
wasn't
enlarged
by
that.
the
government
not
undaunted
says,
“oh,
yes,
it
is.
we
--
we
just
don't
believe
toth
because
many
years
ago
in
johnson
and
(inaudible)
there
was
something
said
to
the
contrary.
i
think
in
the
time
remaining,
i
can
demonstrate
that
the
power
to
court-martial
wives
is
neither
necessary
and
preeminently
improper.
to
begin
with,
under
the
nato
treaties,
any
offense
committed
by
americans
against
foreign
nationals
is
primarily
triable
in
foreign
courts
whether
they're
civilians
or
soldiers.
and
secondly,
serious
offenses
are
very
few,
the
trials
by
general
court-martial
in
the
army
amount
to
12
for
a
fiscal
year,
of
course
not
more
than
20
certainly
and
there
are
only
six
persons
who
have
ever
--
six
civilians
convicted
by
court-martial
who
have
committed
offenses
serious
enough
to
warrant
their
incarceration
in
federal
penal
institutions
and
two
of
those
six
are
before
this
court
at
this
moment.
now,
how
to
deal
with
them.
i
have
suggested
the
traditional
method
for
punishing
extra-territorially
committed
crime,
namely,
by
trial
in
the
first
district
to
which
the
person
is
found
or
brought.
that
wasn't
deemed
too
difficult
in
the
post-war
treason
cases.
it
is
true
there
is
no
power
to
subpoena
witnesses,
but
the
government
had
no
difficulty
last
month
in
flying
18
italian
subjects,
whom
it
couldn't
subpoena,
here
for
the
icardi
case.
of
course,
when
that
case
was
thrown
out,
it
was
rather
too
bad
because
those
were
witnesses
that
couldn't
have
been
used
over
again
in
other
cases.
but,
says
mr.
frankel,
that's
only
for
the
serious
case,
what
about
the
run-of-the-mill
cases?
well,
there's
a
fine
--
a
fine
opportunity
to
test
the
continued
validity
of
the
ross
case.
and
if
the
ross
case
is
still
good
law
as
he
believes,
i
see
no
reason
why
it
isn't
possible
to
provide
for
a
consulate
jurisdiction
to
try
these
persons
who
are
accompanying
the
army
overseas.
i
can't
believe
--
i
can't
believe
that
any
country
friendly
enough
to
permit
us
to
station
our
troops
on
its
soil
in
time
of
peace
and
willing
to
let
us
by
our
tribunals
try
american
national
for
offenses
committed
against
the
american
national
is
going
to
boggle
over
whether
that
trial
is
by
a
court-martial
or
by
a
consular
court
just
so
long
as
the
jurisdiction
is
carefully
restricted.
as
to
the
others,
whether
you're
going
to
militarize
the
civilian
employees
or
whether
you're
going
to
stern
them
over
to
foreign
courts,
those
are
legislative
considerations.
i
only
suggest
that
the
--
if
the
government
instead
of
fighting
the
problem
will
try
to
solve
it,
we
could
get
on
much
better
because
it
is
not
proper,
it
is
simply
not
proper
to
have
these
civilian
women
tried
by
courts-martial.
look
at
the
constitutional
rights
they
lose.
you
can
talk
all
you
like
about
the
beneficent
provisions
of
the
code
and
it's
working
much
better
than
the
old
articles
did
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
doing
a
good
job,
but
think
of
the
constitutional
rights
those
people
lose.
there's
no
right
to
bail
at
military
law.
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
show
that
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
are
perceptively
diluted
over
what
they
would
be
in
article
3
court.
now,
for
certain
military
situations,
nobody
would
quarrel
with
that
when
you're
dealing
governing
armies
composed
of
strong
men
particularly
when
those
armies
are
on
the
march,
of
course,
you've
got
to
have
restrictions
that
aren't
justified
in
civilian
life
but
these
are
unarmed
women
in
time
of
peace
and
i
have
collected
some
of
the
cases
and
there
are
still
some
pretty
rough
conditions
and
they're
not
all
reversal
as
my
brother
indicates
in
his
reply
brief,
a
great
many
very
doubtful
convictions
in
my
judgment
have
been
sustained.
and
look
at
the
--
i
don't
have
to
generalize.
look
at
the
records
here.
look
what
happened
with
these
two
women,
with
these
two
civilian
women,
they
didn't
enlist
in
the
army,
they
may
have
had
the
--
the
obligation
to
obey
in
their
marriage
vows
but
they
didn't
subscribe
to
the
articles
of
war
and
the
uniform
code
when
the
chaplains
announced
them
man
and
wife.
look
at
what
happened
to
these
women
who
faced
the
court-martial
and
the
agencies
of
military
appellate
review.
in
the
covert
case,
the
only
issue
was
(inaudible)
the
witnesses
were
three-to-two
against
her.
all
of
them
were
commissioned
officers
of
the
air
force.
there
were
no
higher
chances.
after
the
trial,
two
of
the
prosecution
witnesses
presented
unsolicited
affidavits,
one
of
them
said
the
findings
are
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
the
other
said
they
are
completely
wrong,
a
third
witness
spelled
out
in
detail
why
he
considered
this
poor
distraught
woman
to
have
been
psychotic
and
not
neurotic.
what
did
the
board
of
review
say?
these
aren't
sufficient
to
raise
even
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
resent.
and
in
both
cases
--
in
both
cases,
the
final
determination
of
whether
these
women
were
or
were
not
sane
was
controlled
by
an
army
air
force
manual
published
to
the
services
by
order
of
the
secretaries
of
the
army
and
air
force,
and
that
is
how
the
sanity
was
determined
not
by
the
professional
views
of
the
--
of
the
witnesses,
not
by
the
civilian
doctor,
not
by
what
the
military
doctor
might
have
said
in
the
civilian
capacity
but
by
this
man.
there's
a
different
test
applied
the
--
during
the
--
the
mcnaughton
rule
with
modification
to
steal
the
military
rule.
judge
sobeloff,
i
think,
has
only
recently
indicated
the
--
the
defects
of
that
rule
but
they're
still
here
and
then
look
at
the
sentence
--
look
at
the
sentence
that's
in
the
toth
case,
as
the
government
pointed
out
to
your
honors
the
persons
who
were
accused
with
toth
had
been
tried
and
punished.
the
lieutenant
who
gave
the
order
to
kill
was
convicted,
his
sentence
was
cut
to
five
years,
it
was
--
he
served
20
months
and
then
he
got
out.
the
--
kinder,
the
airman
who
actually
pulled
the
trigger,
his
sentence
was
cut
to
two
years.on
the
review,
he
got
out
in
15
months
with
an
honorable
discharge.
and
this
poor
woman
who
was
--
who
was
so
--
so
far
gone
mentally
that
after
she
killed
her
husband
she
climbed
into
the
narrow
caught
with
his
bloody
corpse,
she
has
a
life
sentence
affirmed
by
a
board
of
review
which
says
anything
less
would
be
unwarranted
or
inappropriate.
now,
is
that
justice
or
is
it
vindictiveness
and
preeminent?
do
we
want
to
turn
over
to
an
armed
force
the
dispensing
of
justice
to
unarmed
women?
and
there's
one
more
--
one
more
point
on
the
dorothy
smith
case.
dorothy
smith
was
tried
in
tokyo
in
january
of
1953.
the
korean
war
was
almost
at
an
end.
it
was
alleged
but
the
--
the
dependents
could
not
go
to
korea,
they
could
go
to
japan.
it
was
alleged
in
the
return
to
the
writ
in
mrs.
smith's
case
that
japan
was
in
time
of
war
in
the
field
within
the
meaning
of
article
2
(10).
and
that
allegation
was
denied
in
the
congress,
so
the
issue
was
framed.
the
government
presented
no
evidence
on
that
issue.
when
the
government
sought
and
was
granted
certiorari
here
before
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
said
nothing
about
2
(10).
in
my
brief
in
the
krueger
case,
i
mentioned
that,
of
course,
it
wasn't
in
the
field
either
in
the
light
of
the
earlier
and
classical
decisions,
winthrop
in
the
old
judge
advocate
general's
opinions
in
the
digest
and
the
attorney
general
nor
was
it
in
the
field
as
that
term
had
been
defined
in
the
committee
reports
on
the
uniform
code
and
that
i
said
that
they
were
well
advised
to
drop
it.
now,
we
get
in
a
footnote
saying,
“oh,
no,
we're
not
going
to
drop
it
and
we
want
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
case
we
lose
on
2
(11)
we
want
to
go
back
under
2
(10).
we
want
to
produce
more
evidence.”
that's
not
just
desperation,
that
maybe
panic,
but
what
troubles
me
about
--
what
troubles
me
is
that
it
is
really
--
it
really
reflects
vindictiveness.
we
will
not
let
this
woman
go,
she
killed
her
husband.
that's
worst
than
felony,
that's
petty
treason.
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
the
standard
of
the
toth
case
should
be
applied
here,
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed.
it
is
maybe
desirable
as
a
philosophical
matter
to
discipline
wives
in
the
old
common
law
a
way
just
as
long
as
it's
no
thicker
than
one's
thumb.
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
the
discipline
of
an
armed
force
to
try
wives
by
court-martial.
and
i
submit
that
under
the
constitution,
it
can't
be
done.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
court
please.
i
come
here
for
the
second
time
to
urge
that
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
authorizes
the
trial
of
a
civilian
woman
by
court-martial
in
time
of
peace.
but
before
i
address
myself
to
the
constitution,
i
wish
first
to
show
that
no
such
power
can
be
derived
outside
the
constitution
that
the
fact
that
a
foreign
country
may
consent
to
our
taking
the
offender
home,
or
even
trying
the
offender
on
foreign
soil,
does
not
in
and
of
itself
confer
any
jurisdiction
on
our
courts.
and
there
are
two
illustrations
of
that
in
this
court.
one
is
the
wiltberger
case.
wiltberger
killed
a
sailor
on
board
an
american
ship
anchored
off
the
shore
of
some
chinese
river
before
the
days
of
extraterritoriality.
he
was
brought
home
for
trial
and
this
court
held
in
the
5
of
wheaton
that
since
no
act
of
congress
reached
his
offense,
he
went
free.
and
the
second
illustration
is
toth.
toth
was
taken
to
korea
for
trial.
korea
made
no
demand
for
his
surrender
although
he
had
killed
a
korean
national.
toth
was
going
to
be
tried
by
an
american
court-martial
and
this
court
held
that
no
such
jurisdiction
could
be
conferred
on
that
tribunal.
and
the
second
point
is
that
the
jurisdiction
asserted
in
article
2
(11)
of
the
uniform
code
was
always
based
on
our
law
as
the
legislative
history
shows.
the
subject
2
clause
was
intended
only
to
avoid
conflict.
it
was
intended
as
a
limitation
to
avoid
international
complications,
not
as
a
conditional
grant
and
the
best
proof
of
that
is
the
other
woman,
the
british
woman,
mrs.
billhardt
(ph)
who
was
tried
by
an
american
court-martial
in
a
eritrea,
if
you
please.
certainly,
no
treaty
there,
no
agreement,
she
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
in
order
to
get
her
into
(inaudible),
she
had
to
be
paroled
by
the
attorney
general
and
she
is
now
serving
a
life
sentence
there.
and
the
third
point
is
that
the
nato
treaties
didn't
purport
to
enlarge
our
military
jurisdiction.
i
agree
with
the
government,
we
should
regard
these
cases
in
the
light
of
the
nato
or
nato-like
agreements
instead
of
these
temporary
agreements.
it's
perfectly
clear
from
article
vii
of
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement
that
we
were
given
the
right
to
exercise
such
military
jurisdiction
as
we
have
by
our
law.
it
didn't
purport
to
enlarge
our
jurisdiction
and
it
couldn't
have
done
so
because
if
these
people
were
not
triable
by
military
law
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
the
limitations
of
our
constitution,
no
treaty
could
remove
those
constitution
--
those
limitations.
and
in
that
connection,
i'd
like
to
read
only
two
sentences
from
the
brief
the
government
filed
two
terms
ago
in
the
katz
case.
the
basic
axiom
is
that
as
a
sovereign
state,
the
united
state
possesses
in
its
dealing
with
other
states,
all
of
the
normal
powers
of
a
fully
independent
nation,
subject
to
constitutional
limitations
like
the
bill
of
rights
which
governed
all
exercise
of
governmental
authority
in
this
country.
and
again,
together
with
statutes
and
treaties,
executive
agreements
are
subject
to
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
other
clauses
of
the
constitution
which
protect
all
americans
from
the
excesses
of
official
authority.
now,
i
submit
that
that
is
a
doctrine
too
fundamental
to
be
put
on
or
taken
off
like
a
dress
shirt
as
occasion
may
require.
the
bill
of
rights
is
a
limitation
on
all
federal
power
where
--
wherever
it's
exerted
and
even
if
you
leave
the
word
treaty
power
and
talk
about
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
relations,
that
power
can
only
be
exercised
within
the
limitations
of
the
bill
of
rights.
and
insofar
as
the
military
needs
of
the
international
community
to
which
resort
is
made
are
relevant,
those
needs
can
be
satisfied
by
us,
only
subject
to
our
own
constitutional
limitations.
so,
i
come
back
to
the
constitution,
which
is
the
source
of
all
power.
we
must
bottom
this
asserted
power
to
try
by
court-martial
civilian
women
and
civilian
children
on
some
grant
of
power
in
the
constitution.
now,
before
i
get
to
what
may
be
regarded
as
doctrine
of
considerations,
i'd
like
to
explore
briefly
some
of
the
so-called
practical
considerations
which
appear
in
the
government's
briefs.
some
of
them
are
just
lawyers'
talk
in
briefs.
some
of
them
are
letters
from
overseas
commanders,
plainly
and
literally
self-serving
letters
from
the
very
officers
whose
powers
are
here
called
in
question.
this
court
has
never
in
going
outside
of
the
record
to
find
materials
of
a
--
facts
of
general
knowledge
has
never
looked
to
self-serving
documents
of
this
nature
and
more
importantly,
those
materials
are
wholly
unsatisfactory
in
several
important
respects.
let's
take
first
dependents.
the
government
argued,
“well,
we've
got
to
try
these
poor
girls
by
court-martial
otherwise,
they
will
be
thrust
into
some
foreign
court.”
and
we
pointed
out
that
under
the
nato
status
of
forces
agreement,
all
offenses
by
civilian
dependents,
not
just
offenses
outside
the
camp,
all
offenses
by
civilian
dependents
are
given
to
the
foreign
country
as
having
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly,
and
without
regard
to
the
victim
of
their
offenses.
any
of
a
primary
jurisdiction
over
all
offenses
by
civilian
dependents
is
conceded
to
the
receiving
state
by
the
nato
treaty
and
the
government
replies
to
that.
well,
it's
the
best
deal
we
could
get.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
now
then,
we
said
there
are
very
few
cases
of
court-martial
trials
of
civilian
dependents.
out
of
almost
10,000
cases
in
the
court
of
military
appeals,
there
have
only
been
four
and
two
of
them
are
here.
we
still
don't
know,
we
still
don't
know
how
many
civilian
dependents
have
been
tried
by
court-martial.
the
government
says,
"well,
there
are
about
500
offenses
and
we
got
waivers
out
of
420."
but
they
don't
say
how
many
were
actually
tried
by
american
court-martial
and
i
will
be
very
much
interested
in
seeing
the
memorandum
which
the
chief
justice
has
requested
because
i
don't
think
there
will
be
many.
so,
is
it
the
--
is
it
the
urge
to
punish
crime
that
is
the
motivating
factor
here
or
is
it
the
urge
to
control
and
discipline
the
women?
i
suggest
that
it
is
the
latter
because
the
first
has
been
provided.
now,
we
get
to
the
civilian
employees
and
we
said,
“yes,
we
--
there
are
23,000
american
civilian
employees
overseas.”
what
military
reason
is
there
why
you
need
civilians
to
do
military
work?
and
we
said
pointing
to
the
budget
for
the
appropriations
hearing
in
the
committee
reports
in
similar
legislative
material,
the
only
reason
they've
got
civilians
doing
military
work
overseas
is
budgetary,
it
costs
a
little
less.
now,
whether
these
modern
budgets
give
us
more
bang
for
the
buck
is
of
course
not
a
justiciable
issue,
but
whether
they
give
us
less
constitutional
protection
for
a
buck
is.
we
said
there's
no
breakdown
of
these
23,000
civilians.
how
many
of
them
are
clerks
and
shoppers?
our
understanding
is
most
of
more
in
the
lower
brackets.
well,
we
still
get
no
breakdown
although
it's
finally
conceded
that
some
40%
are
in
class
five
or
lower,
but
we
do
get
some
figures
on
people
who
aren't
even
civilian
employees
of
the
united
states
who
are
just
employees
of
contractors
and
technical
representatives.
and
as
the
government
argues,
the
only
alternative
trial
by
court-martial
is
no
trial
at
all
for
two
reasons.
many
of
these
offenses
are
not
offenses
against
foreign
law
and
many
others
are
not
offenses
against
the
general
criminal
law
and
we
say,
“well,
what
about
the
alien
employees
of
the
department
of
defense
overseas?”
there
are
15
times
as
many
alien
civilian
employees
as
american
civilian
employees
and
the
government
says,
“oh
well,
we
don't
let
them
near
the
classified
papers.”
and
then,
we
ask,
“what
about
the
civilians
at
military
installations
in
the
united
states?
every
one
of
which
from
the
pentagon
down
is
infested
by
civilian
who
works
cheek
by
jaw,
side
by
side
with
the
persons
in
uniform.”
“oh,”
says
the
government,
“we
have
a
u.s.
commissioner
and
he
tries
traffic
offenses.”
well,
now,
that's
a
pretty
agile
broken
field
running,
but
this
is
an
appellate
court,
not
the
rose
bowl.
and
i
submit
that
these
materials
are
utterly
unreliable
as
a
basis
performing
a
--
a
judicial
judgment
on
what
is
necessary
or
what
is
reasonable,
but
more
importantly,
this
is
not
a
question
of
reasonableness
or
of
legislative
judgment.
it
is
a
matter
that
has
been
placed
beyond
the
scope
of
legislative
judgment
by
the
constitution.
and
i
will
illustrate
by
the
cases
mr.
solicitor
has
referred
to,
the
state
cases
that
say,
you
don't
have
to
have
indictment
or
jury
trial.
well,
now,
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
say
in
california
that
“we
will
prosecute
by
information
instead
of
indictment”
or
to
say
in
utah,
“we
will
only
put
eight
men
on
a
criminal
jury.”
that
is
perfectly
reasonable
and
therefore,
it
does
not
contravene
the
due
process
clause.
but
you
certainly
couldn't
justify
similar
procedures
in
a
federal
court
on
the
ground
that
it
is
reasonable
and
reasonable
congressmen
might
conclude
that
this
is
a
better
way
to
do
it,
because
federal
action
is
governed
by
the
bill
of
rights.
now,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
extended
jury
trial
and
even
more
importantly,
a
boundary
between
civil
and
military
jurisdiction
and
to
ascertain
that,
you
use
other
techniques.
you
resort
to
history,
to
the
precedents,
to
the
practice,
best
illustration,
best
reasoned
illustration.
in
the
crawford
case,
this
court
held
in
the
212
u.s.
that
you
couldn't
use
government
employees
on
a
criminal
jury.
in
the
wood
case
in
the
299,
that
was
overruled,
why?
because
the
government
showed
by
resort
to
historical
materials
from
the
days
of
black-leather-folios
and
law
of
french
that
a
king-servant
wasn't
per
se
ineligible
to
be
a
juror.
that
is
the
technique
that
you
used.
now,
everything,
history,
precedents
and
practice
and
i
will
go
into
the
history
in
--
at
some
length
because
of
the
materials
that
have
been
adduced
here.
all
three
unite
against
this
military
jurisdiction
over
civilian
wives
in
time
of
peace.
and
first
--
first,
i
looked
at
clause
14
of
article
8
--
article
i
section
8,
“the
power
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.”
i
will
call
that
by
way
of
short-hand
through
out
the
clause
14
power.
well,
the
first
blush
impression
is
that
the
power
to
govern
the
armed
forces
is
not
a
power
to
govern
wives
of
the
armed
forces,
because
they're
not
a
part
of
the
armed
forces.
they're
not
members
of
the
armed
forces.
true,
when
they
marry
a
service
man,
marriage
is
a
contract
that
creates
a
status.
enlistment
is
a
contract
that
creates
a
status,
but
when
the
chaplain
marries
the
girl,
he
isn't
acting
as
recruiting
sergeant.
and
what
about
the
children,
why
do
the
children
become
subject
to
military
law
just
because
papa
wears
a
soldier
suit?
now,
that
first
blush
impression
that
the
land
and
naval
forces
doesn't
include
the
wives
and
children
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
is
confirmed
by
detailed
study
and
such
study
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
military
jurisdiction
is
a
matter
of
status,
except
for
a
very
limited
class
of
civilians.
now,
historically
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
would
--
that
is
substantially
so
subject
perhaps
to
this
reservation.
i'm
dealing
only
with
wives
here
but
--
at
the
beginning,
when
this
--
when
i
commenced
this
litigation,
i
felt
that
possibly
you
could
make
a
distinction
based
on
functional
connection.
but
the
deeper
i
went
into
it,
the
deeper
--
the
more
convinced
i
was
if
the
line
is
drawn
on
status
and
therefore
functional
connection
--
therefore,
although
a
military
jurisdiction
asserted
over
a
person
is
not
functionally
connected
was
broader
than
over
at
persons
who
were
so
connected.
there
wasn't
any
justification
for
the
other
either
in
time
of
peace,
because
traditionally,
the
only
civilian
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
were
under
three
very
distinct
limitations.
the
first
was
functional
connection.
the
second
was
it
had
to
be
in
time
of
war
or
actual
hostility
and
the
third
had
--
was
that
it
had
to
be
in
the
field
that
is
to
say
in
the
theater
of
war
or
actual
hostility.
as
i
point
out
later,
the
extension
from
person
serving
with
which
implied
functional
connection
and
from
retainers
to
the
camp
which
implied
some
degree
at
least
of
functional
connection
to
persons
merely
accompanying,
so
that
the
mother-in-law
would
be
subject
to
the
miliary
jurisdiction
if
she
stayed
long
enough
as
the
curious
legislative
history
of
the
code
indicates.
there
was
an
extension,
but
--
but
i
think
that
when
you
go
into
it,
it
--
that
jurisdiction
over
evens
functionally
connected
persons
can't
be
properly
or
constitutionally
exercised
in
time
of
peace.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly,
yes.
so
that
the
traditional
jurisdiction
was
limited
by
occupation
by
time
and
by
place
and
of
course
these
women
aren't
in
either.
and
those
limitations
were
never
extended
whenever
they
were
called
in
question,
the
post
trader,
the
contractor,
the
clerks
and
winthrop.
winthrop
did
say
after
30
years
study
of
the
subject
of
military
law
that
any
statute
which
attempts
to
subject
the
civilian
to
military
jurisdiction
in
time
of
peace
is
necessarily
unconstitutional.
now,
i
come
to
this
so-called
historical
material
presented
as
newly
discovered.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
not
in
the
--
i'll
give
a
short
answer
now
and
then
discuss
it
at
length
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause.
the
answer
is
you
can
not
sweep
beyond
the
1789
boundary
of
jury
trial.
on
that,
i
am
--
on
common
ground
with
the
solution
general.
now
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
yes,
definitely.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
--
yes
your
honor.
the
history
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
i
did
not.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
their
purpose
was
to
carry
forward
what
had
been
article
of
war
2
(d)
since
1960.
nobody
sensed
a
constitutional
issue.
in
the
language
which
the
draftsman
of
the
committee
once
used
in
a
classroom
in
my
hearing,
they
didn't
even
know
enough
to
be
confused.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
so
unaware
of
the
rasmussen
case
and
the
requirement
for
a
jury
trial
in
alaska
that
they
obligedly
included
the
bar
allusions
within
article
2
(11)
because
they
said,
“oh
well,
a
civil
system
isn't
--
was
available.”
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
he
was
the
draftsman.
and
--
and
his
--
he
had
disposed
of
this
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
not
on
this
--
not
in
this
field,
mr.
justice.
not
in
this
field
and
i
will
--
i
will
explain
why.
he
said
and
he's
imprint
on
it.
he
said
--
the
fifth
amendment
says,
“not
members
of
the
land
and
naval
forces,
but
cases
arising
in
the
land
and
naval
forces.”
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly.
he
assumed
and
he
had
plenty
of
company
and
lower
court
decisions
his
way.
he
assumed
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
cases
arising
and
in
other
words,
he
looked
on
the
fifth
amendment
as
a
grant
of
court-martial
power.
now,
toth
of
that
course
exploded
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
i
regard
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
it
wasn't
--
there
wasn't
a
whisper
on
it.
nobody
had
any
question.
here
is
the
sort
of
things.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
nobody
raised
this
question.
nobody
saw
a
constitutional
question
even
in
attempting
to
apply
military
trials
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
to
be
a
solution.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
it's
--
and
here
is
the
discussion
which
i
think
are
on
the
floor.
mr.
kemp,
senator
kemp
is
asking
a
question
about
this
and
incidentally
this
quotation
disposes
of
the
notion
that
congress
was
making
a
conscious
choice
between
competing
jurisdictional
ideas.
mr.
kemp,
“i
should
like
to
ask
a
question
in
regard
to
subsection
11
of
article
2
to
which
the
senator
has
just
made
reference.
am
i
correct
in
interpreting
subsection
11
to
mean
that
a
wife
who
accompanies
her
husband
who
is
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
to
appoint
outside
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states
would
be
subject
to
this
code?”
and
senator
keith
hoffer
who
is
in
charge
of
the
bill
said,
“if
a
wife
accompanies
her
husband
outside
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states
and
outside
the
territories
listed
in
subsection
11,
she
will
be
subject
to
the
uniform
code
as
presented
in
this
bill
just
as
she
is
subject
to
the
military
code
today.”
nobody
raised
their
thought
or
--
or
any
conception
that
there
was
even
a
constitutional
question.
now
on
3
(a)
--
on
3
(a)
which
was
condemned
in
toth,
there
was
a
discussion.
they
had
--
a
question
was
raised
as
to
its
constitutionality.
but
on
this,
they
just
went
blithely
along.
this
has
been
in
--
on
the
books
since
1916.
we'll
extend
it
slightly
even
including
part
of
a
(inaudible)
there
just
wasn't
any
constitutional
discussion
at
all
on
this
until
we
left
it.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there
was
none
in
1916
and
all
that
general
crowder,
who
was
a
distinguished
military
lawyer,
all
that
general
crowder
apparently
had
on
his
mind
was
the
fact
that
at
thieving
quartermaster
clerk
who
had
been
in
cuba,
in
the
second
intervention
under
governor
magoon
escaped
back
to
the
united
states
and
got
off
scot-free
because
he
was
covered
by
an
amnesty
proclamation,
and
that
is
all
that
he
ever
had
on
his
mind.
there
wasn't
--
there
has
never
been
in
the
congress,
there
has
never
been
in
the
congress
a
word
about
the
constitutional
validity
of
article
2
(11)
or
of
any
credit.
i
turn
now
to
the
so-called
historical
materials
and
when
i
--
after
i
read
them,
i
filed
this
reply
with
a
red
cover
to
flag
the
other
untrustworthiness
of
the
materials.
the
government
relied
on
a
discussion
in
the
continental
congress
in
1786
and
said,
“see,
here
is
the
law
that
the
continental
congress
passed
in
1786.”
that
is
the
statute
that
never
was.
it
wasn't
passed.
now,
today,
the
government
has
filed
this
and
said,
“well,
maybe
it
wasn't
a
law
and
they
take
me
to
test
for
what
i've
said,
and
they
are
correct
in
criticizing
me.”
if
i
had
researched
for
a
little
further,
i
could
and
should
have
pointed
out
that
not
only
didn't
in
this
provision
that
they
rely
on
it
in
their
brief,
passed
the
continental
congress
12
days
later
when
the
1786
articles
of
war
were
adopted.
it
repealed
the
similar
provision
that
had
been
in
the
1776
articles.
well,
now,
let's
get
to
mr.
blumenthal.
and
if
he
is
the
lawyer,
he
is
not
listed
in
(inaudible)
i
assume
he's
a
diligent
(inaudible)
historian.
women
camp
followers
of
the
american
revolution
and
this
proves
only
what
a
good
many
have
known
that
the
most
enduring
and
durable
alliance
of
all
is
between
mars
and
venus.
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
--
were
war
time
cases.all
of
them
were
war
time
cases
in
the
field.
two,
there
are
three
british
trials
of
wives.one
was
in
the
boston
in
december
1775
when
general
washington
and
his
continental
army
had
battled
up
the
british
there.
so
plainly,
that
was
the
war
situation
if
indeed
it
wasn't
in
modern
concepts
to
martial
law
situation.
and
then
there
were
two
trials
of
wives
in
canada
in
the
1760s
when
canada
was
occupied
territory,
because
in
french
sovereignty,
the
french
still
had
title
to
those
provinces.
to
answer
the
question
mr.
justice
black
asked,
when
was
the
first
american
wife
tried
by
court-martial.
there
are
no
authenticated
instances
of
such
trials
in
the
american
service
in
this
book
or
anywhere
else,
and
it
wasn't
until
1950,
175
years
after
washington
took
the
man
to
the
continental
army
that
the
cluster
of
american
arms
was
tarnished
by
any
such
performance.
now,
let
me
just
deal
briefly
with
some
of
the
other
historical
materials.
there's
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
coast
guard
which
used
to
be
known
of
course
as
the
revenue
cutter
service
had
civilian
seamen
on
board
public
vessels
and
the
implication
of
course
is
that
these
civilian
seamen,
notwithstanding
their
civilian
status
were
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial.
that
is
a
mistaken
implication
because
the
revenue
cutter
services
never
had
court-martial
jurisdiction
of
any
kind
until
1906.
then,
there
is
--
there
are
dug
out
of
the
archives
some
trials
of
settlers
in
the
1920s
and
1930s,
not
in
the
field.
and
it
is
said,
“this
shows
that
the
practice
was
broader
than
winthrop
indicate.”
well
now,
there
were
three
instances
at
the
time
when
the
army
didn't
have
a
lawyer
and
when
the
question
came
up
after
the
settler
had
become
the
post
trader.
the
judge
advocate
general
of
the
army
held
there's
no
such
jurisdiction.
he
is
not
a
camp
follower
because
he
can
only
have
camp
followers
in
time
of
war.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
your
honor,
that
is
(inaudible)
indians.
it's
at
pages
46
to
47
of
the
white
brief,
it's
set
forth
in
full.
then,
the
government
very
conveniently
sets
forth,
i'm
awfully
glad
they
did
in
appendix
b
of
their
reply
brief
on
re-argument
beginning
at
page
86.
two
opinions
of
the
judge
advocate
general
in
full,
which
we
only
had
in
digested
form
and
as
their
text
is
reflected
in
winthrop.
and
they
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
civilian
settler
retainers
to
the
camp
jurisdiction
of
the
american
articles
of
war
that
was
there
beginning
in
1775
was
limited
to
a
time
of
war
or
actual
hostilities
and
was
limited
to
a
situation
in
the
field
when
the
troops
were
engaged
in
defensive
our
offensive
operations.
the
argument
seems
to
be,
the
argument
seems
to
be
that
because
that
opinion
refers
to
a
few
trials
which
took
place
earlier
and
condemns
those
trials,
therefore,
the
condemned
practice
is
to
be
taken
as
more
correctly
establishing
the
law
than
the
opinion
which
condemned
it.
that
goes
under
the
name
of
history.
well,
now,
that
being
sought
when
the
constitutional
convention
adopted
clause
14,
verbatim
from
the
articles
of
confederation,
can
it
be
supposed
that
anybody
read
in
those
words
land
and
naval
forces
an
expansible
jurisdiction?
when
your
honors
recall
that
even
the
provision
for
a
standing
army
under
the
army
clause
of
the
constitution
was
denounced
as
unconstitutional
in
the
first
congress,
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
if
anyone
had
ever
imagined
that
clause
to
be
an
expansible
concept,
capable
of
including
within
a
sweep
women
and
children
that
some
of
the
valuable
articulate
and
imaginative
anti-federalists
wouldn't
have
screamed
to
high
heaven,
all
through
the
ratifying
conventions
just
impossible?
there,
it
is
correct
to
say
that
with
only
scattered
exceptions,
there
were
no
actual
civilian
trials
by
court-martial
in
time
of
peace
with
approval
of
higher
authority
before
1941
that
there
was
no
trial
of
a
wife
by
court-martial
until
1950
and
that
even
those
first
trials
with
military
government
trials
because
they
took
place
in
occupied
territory.
now,
the
conclusion
that
the
clause
14
power
doesn't
reach
these
two
women
follows
from
anyone
of
three
independent
bases.
and
the
first
is
a
contemporaneous
long,
continued
construction
of
the
constitutional
provision.
the
second
is
that
we
look
for
our
boundaries
of
jury
trial,
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
1789.
and
third,
whenever
that
boundary
was
sought
to
be
extended,
in
the
milligan
case,
in
duncan
against
kahanamoku
and
in
the
toth
case,
the
attempt
has
failed,
and
i'm
happy
to
see
that
it
hasn't
succeeded
here
again.
now,
is
that
clause
14
power,
it's
varied
by
anything
in
the
necessary
and
proper
clause?
in
the
toth
case,
it
was
squarely
held
in
the
negative.
toth
case,
the
court
said,
“that
power
is
not
enlarged
by
necessary
and
proper.”
we
show
that
no
one
ever
thought
so
in
1789.
we
show
that
no
one
ever
thought
so
after
mcculloch
against
maryland
that
demonstrated
the
potentialities
of
that
clause.
we
show
that
no
military
man
who
certainly
wouldn't
be
backward
about
asserting
military
jurisdiction
ever
thought
so
for
a
century
afterwards
and
here
is
the
reason.
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
after
all
is
the
doctrine
of
implied
powers.
but
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
doesn't
dilute
specific
personal
guarantees
because
after
all
the
bill
of
rights
amends
clause
18
of
section
8
of
article
i
just
as
much
as
it
amends
everything
else
in
the
constitution.
and
if
we
go
back
--
if
we
go
back
to
what
the
great
chief
justice
said
in
mcculloch
against
maryland
and
i'll
just
read
a
single
sentence
which
has
really
foreshadowed
the
entire
development
of
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
that
the
end
be
legitimate.
let
it
be
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution
and
all
means
which
are
appropriate
which
are
plainly
adopted
to
that
end
which
are
not
prohibited
but
consist
with
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution,
our
constitution.
now,
our
position
is
that
to
try
by
court-martials,
civilian
women
in
time
of
peace
who
weren't
so
triable
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
is
not
a
legitimate
and
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
constitution,
is
twice
prohibited
by
the
constitution
and
is
utterly
inconsistent
with
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
constitution,
and
that
brings
us
back
to
the
toth
conclusion.
and
as
i
have
said
in
response
to
questions
put
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
nobody,
--
nobody
ever
raised
the
constitutional
question
when
this
jurisdiction
over
civilians
was
first
extended
and
that
was
in
1916
as
to
all
free
limitations.
from
functional
connection,
they
went
to
accompanying.
from
war,
they
went
to
peace
and
from
theater
of
operations
they
went
to
outside
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states.
in
the
briefs,
there
is
considerable
discussion
as
to
whether
the
wives
and
children
outside
the
united
states
are
part
of
the
armed
forces.
i
think
it's
an
attempt
to
semanticize
the
men
to
a
military
status
and
certainly
so
far
as
the
civilian
dependents
are
concerned,
that
attempt
necessarily
breaks
down
in
the
face
of
the
nato
provisions
which
put
them
in
a
separate
category
and
don't
give
them
as
much
--
don't
subject
them
to
as
much
american
jurisdiction
as
civilian
employees
or
members
of
the
forces.
and
i
was
prepared
to
argue
as
i've
argued
in
the
briefs
that
they
are
no
more
members
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
than
the
women
who
are
quartered
with
their
husbands
on
any
army
post
or
air
force
base
or
naval
station
in
the
united
states.
and
then,
i
must
confess,
i
was
--
i
was
amazed
when
the
solicitor
general
said
that
it's
only
a
question
of
legislative
judgment
that
anytime
congress
wants
to
subject
the
good
ladies
in
fort
myer
to
trial
by
court-martial,
they
can
do
so.
i
suggest
to
my
learned
friend
that
he
examine
the
sixth
amendment
and
read
it
over
just
once.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
would
--
i
would
say
mr.
justice
that
england
during
the
war
was
in
the
field.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i'm
not
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it's
--
it's
only
a
theoretical
because
there
were
no
wives
there
unless
they
happen
to
have
some
other
military
status.
but
i
would
say
that
--
that
england
which
was
a
base
for
the
--
the
largest
amphibious
invasion
of
history,
which
was
subject
to
enemy
bombardment,
enemy
bombing,
i
wouldn't
have
any
difficulty
in
saying
that
was
in
the
field
and
that
anyone
accompanying
the
armies
there
was
in
the
field,
was
subject
to
trial
and
was
with
---
within
the
traditional
limitations.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
that
would
be
a
question
of
--
of
english
constitutional
law
whether
a
--
an
english
civilian
working
for
the
forces
could
be
so
tried.
but
i
think
from
our
point
of
view,
if
we
had
these
people
actually
there,
the
newspaper
correspondence,
i
would
say
that
they
were
within
the
field
and
--
and
within
the
traditional
limitations.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
whether
england
--
whatever
england
ceded
would
have
no
effect
on
our
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
all
that
england
could
do
was
say
that
they
did
--
wouldn't
cede
jurisdiction.
they
would
consent
to
our
exercise
of
jurisdiction,
but
whether
we
had
jurisdiction
would
depend
on
our
law.
but
i
would
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
england
was
in
the
field
during
world
war
ii
so
far
as
our
forces
were
concerned.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
that
was
not
in
the
field.
it
was
too
far
back.
they
let
wives
over.
korea,
yes,
probably
even
southern
korea.
they
never
let
dependents
go
there.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
and
the
troops
were
moved
out
of
the
san
francisco
port
and
the
--
the
orders
were
given
from
the
pentagon.
but
--
but
japan
was
too
far
back.
japan
was
too
far
back
and
the
best
proof
of
it
is
that
in
the
covert
case
that
they
didn't
even
try
to
defend
on
that
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke
--
in
the
dorothy
krueger
smith
case,
there
was
no
attempt
to
defend
that
the
trial
level
on
the
basis
that
japan
was
in
the
field
within
the
meaning
of
that
jurisdiction.
well,
now,
if
we
can't
rest
this
power
on
clause
14,
where
can
we
find
it?
what
about
the
consular
courts?
well,
the
consular
court
as
judge
hudson
said
is
a
more
abundant
historical
jurisdiction.
it's
rather
ironic
that
congress
and
the
president
repealed
it
and
disposed
of
it
in
the
very
year
that
it
was
relied
on
here
to
support
something
else.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
there
--
there's
no
more
consular
jurisdiction,
those
statutes
have
been
repealed.
there's
no
more
extraterritorial
consular
jurisdiction
exercised
by
the
united
states
anywhere.
that
went
out
last
--
the
statute
was
passed
joint
resolution
on
august.
it
was
given
up
on
october.
it's
all
out
the
window
now
as
a
matter
of
history.
is
it
possible
to
sustain
that
jurisdiction?
well,
it
isn't
possible
to
do
it
on
the
ground
in
which
it
was
placed
in
re
ross.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
certainly.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
beginning
the
first
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
beginning
the
first
of
this
year.
but
of
course,
they're
not
bound
by
constitutional
limitations.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
question
was
whether
the
british
had
conferred
a
2
(11)
jurisdiction
on
courts-martial
and
the
answer
is
yes,
effective
the
first
of
this
year.
and
i
--
and
i
was
about
to
add
that
of
course
they
have
no
written
constitution
in
both
the
toth
and
hirschberg
cases
that
would
have
arisen
differently
if
they
had
come
up
under
english
law.
the
ground
for
sustaining
the
consular
trial
given
in
ross
was
that
the
constitution
can
have
no
operation
in
a
foreign
country.
we
know
that
that's
a
stand
up
because
that
this
court
later
said,
“the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
in
enforced
whenever
and
wherever
the
power
of
our
government
is
exercised,”
so
that
does
in
ross.
and
then
there
was
a
query,
i
think
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
last
june,
“can't
it
be
said
that
the
consular
court
that
tried
ross
was
exercising
japanese
judicial
power?”
and
if
you
look
at
the
consular
court
proceedings,
that
does
in
ross
either
because
he
was
an
american
officer.
he
derived
his
power
from
an
american
statute
and
then
in
his
warrants
and
on
the
entire
proceedings,
they
recited
a
reliance
on
acts
of
congress.
the
only
basis
i
think
--
the
only
basis
on
which
it
is
possible
to
sustain
the
consular
jurisdiction
is
that
it
is
free
constitution
that
it
goes
back
to
the
treaty
with
morocco
at
1786
which
was
ratified
to
the
continental
congress
while
the
constitutional
convention
was
in
session.
so
that
in
other
words,
the
person
tried
by
a
consul
can't
claim
a
jury
because
it
was
pre-constitutional,
but
that's
the
very
reason
why
these
women
can't
be
tried
by
court-martial
because
these
women
in
their
status
in
time
of
peace
were
not
triable
by
a
court-martial
in
time
of
peace.
and
i
have
elsewhere
in
the
brief
discussed
the
very
great
differences
between
general
extraterritoriality
such
as
what's
involved
in
ross
and
military
extraterritoriality
relegate
that
rather
complicated
background
discussion
to
my
brief,
and
will
only
say
that
in
military
extraterritoriality,
however
far
it
extends,
the
fact
that
the
foreign
sovereign
confers
it
doesn't
automatically
confer
jurisdiction
on
us
and
toth
of
course
proves
them.
now,
i
address
myself
to
the
question
of
legislative
courts,
and
that
i
would
like
to
cover
at
some
length.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
until
last
june,
nobody
ever
considered
a
court-martial
to
be
a
legislative
court.
that
was
regarded
as
an
executive
agency
and
it
was
so
regarded
for
two
functional
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
court-martial
is
created
by
the
order
of
an
executive
officer,
generally
a
military
officer.
and
in
the
second
place,
the
court-martial
requires
the
approval
of
the
appointing
officer
to
give
validity
to
each
judgment.
that
is
still
so
under
the
code.
there
is
nothing
on
which
the
appellate
processes
can
operate
until
the
convening
authority
has
acted
on
the
judgment
and
dismissal
--
death
in
general
officer
cases,
there
must
also
be
action,
further
action
by
the
secretary
or
the
president
to
give
validity
to
the
judgments.
so,
they're
not
legislative
courts.
by
their
very
nature,
they're
executive
courts.
but
assuming
for
purposes
of
argument
that
courts-martial
are
legislative
courts
does
not
help
solve
the
problem.
we
think
not,
because
at
the
basis
of
legislative
courts,
as
your
honors
said
in
bakelite
is
that
other
articles
invest
congress
with
powers
in
the
exertion
of
which
it
may
create
inferior
courts
and
clothe
them
with
functions
deemed
essential
or
helpful
in
carrying
those
powers
into
execution.
so
that
if
a
court-martial
is
a
legislative
court,
it
must
be
a
court
created
under
the
clause
14
power
which
brings
us
right
back
to
where
we
started.
moreover,
and
this
is
a
point
on
which
i
fear
the
government's
arguments
have
always
been
confused.
the
question
of
legislative
versus
constitutional
court
doesn't
solve
the
question
of
jury
trial.
take
alaska,
a
plaintiff.
the
alaskan
courts
are
legislative
courts.
the
judges
don't
have
life
tenure.
their
salaries
can
be
reduced.
they
can
be
removed
by
the
president
for
cause
but
the
defendant,
the
criminal
defendant
in
alaska
is
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
and
i
see
no
reason
incidentally
why
a
man
can't
be
tried
for
treason.
and
the
u.s.
court
for
alaska
or
the
u.s.
court
in
puerto
rico
or
the
u.s.
court
of
the
territory
of
hawaii.
article
iii
has
to
do
with
the
judges'
tenure
and
his
salary
and
his
removability.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
a
jury
trial.
furthermore,
in
the
three
insular
cases
relied
on
by
the
court
last
june,
mankichi,
dorr
and
balzac,
those
were
not
courts
created
by
congress.
those
were
insular
courts
that
had
long
existed
whose
existence
was
recognized
by
congress,
and
the
decision
went
on
the
grounds,
simply
on
the
ground,
we
will
not
inflict
on
these
offshore
possessions
with
a
long
non-common
law
jury
heritage,
something
that
has
its
roots
deep
in
the
institutions
and
the
processes
of
common
law
country.
and
i
don't
think
and
i
have
read
and
reread
those
cases
many
times
since
june.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
them
to
support
the
proposition
that
all
of
the
bill
of
rights
stops
at
the
water's
edge.
now,
we
know
that
guam
which
is
an
unincorporated
territory,
the
courts
at
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
there
is
right
to
a
grand
jury
and
it
can't
be
taken
away
retroactively.
we
know
that
in
the
philippines
and
in
puerto
rico,
the
protections
against
double
jeopardy
and
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
had
been
given
effect.
we
know
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
but
the
organic
act
provisions
were
construed
as
though
they
were
constructional
provisions
and
there
is
certainly
language
in
the
cases
which
suggest
that
those
are
privileges
that
couldn't
have
been
taken
away
even
if
they
hadn't
been
specifically
set
forth
in
the
organic
act.
now,
take
the
matter
of
bail.
how
can
you
justify
depriving
civilians
of
bail?
if
you
subject
them
to
military
law,
you
deprive
them
of
bail.
there's
no
such
thing
as
bail
in
military
law.
even
the
--
the
offshore
territories
always
had
bail,
even
the
consular
courts
had
a
system
of
bail.
and
i
would
say
that
the
absence
of
bail
in
the
military
system
really
emphasizes
the
other
inappropriateness
of
trying
civilians
by
military
courts,
and
i
ask
the
question.
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
justifies
withdrawing
that
guarantee
from
these
women
simply
because
they're
married
to
servicemen
and
they're
living
with
them
overseas?
where
is
the
source
of
power?
let's
talk
about
legislative
choice.
well,
as
the
colloquy
between
senators
kemp
and
keith
hoffer
which
i've
read
shows,
congress
made
no
choice,
no
conscious
choice,
it
was
simply
continuing
in
essence
a
military
jurisdiction
that
was
always
on
the
books.
but
in
any
event,
i
will
say,
it
is
not
a
legitimate
legislative
choice
to
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial
persons
who
don't
fall
within
clause
14,
for
two
reasons,
both
of
which
i
will
develop
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
the
first
is
that
courts-martial
are
necessarily
regulated
by
the
executive.
now,
the
president
can
legislate
for
those
whom
he
commands.
he
is
the
commander-in-chief
and
every
order
has
a
--
implies
a
legislative
content.
and
i'm
not
troubled
by
his
ordering
the
armed
forces
about
it.
he
is
their
commander-in-chief.
it's
his
business
to
give
orders.
that's
what
a
commander
is.
but
he's
not
the
commander-in-chief
of
the
civilian
wives
and
as
i
will
demonstrate
in
more
detail,
unless
--
unless
you
give
the
president
to
these
broad
uncanalized
legislative
powers,
you
don't
really
have
a
system
of
military
law.
and
the
second
which
i
will
also
develop
at
greater
length
is
that
military
trial
of
civilians
is
inconsistent
with
our
institutions
and
foreign
to
our
traditions.
and
no
other
power,
no
other
power
authorizes
this
trial.
this
was
time
of
peace.
it
wasn't
an
occupied
territory
case.
it
wasn't
the
madsen
v.
kinsella
situation.
the
madsen
v.
kinsella
wasn't
cited
last
june
in
the
opinion
because
it
was
plainly
irrelevant,
a
very
different
proposition.
and
the
war
power,
we
submit
would
be
unavailing
here
twice,
twice
before
this
court.
the
war
power
has
been
relied
upon
to
extend
military
jurisdiction
over
civilians.
twice
the
attempt
has
met
with
defeat,
ex
parte
milligan,
duncan
against
kahanamoku.
now,
there's
some
talk
in
the
briefs
about
the
combination
of
powers,
combination
of
powers.
well,
yes,
if
you're
writing
a
brief
or
writing
an
opinion,
there
are
many
situations
in
which
you
can
say,
“well,
this
can
be
supported
on
this
clause
and
that
clause
and
the
other
clause.”
it's
very
easy
to
write
that
and
it
makes
sense
that
way.
but
here,
we're
dealing
with
two
powers
which
are
severely
insufficient.
the
clause
14
power
is
insufficient
because
these
women
aren't
part
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
the
treaty
power,
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
relations
is
insufficient
because
you
can't
make
a
valid
treaty
that
will
conflict
with
the
bill
of
rights.
how
then
do
you
get
a
sufficiency
out
of
those
two
individual
insufficient
powers?
we
say
that
even
in
constitutional
law,
the
whole
isn't
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts?
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
unless
you
can
put
these
trials
under
clause
14,
it
is
impossible
to
support
them.
one
reason
is
perhaps
it'll
complicate
it
for
oral
argument.
absent
clause
14,
what
has
made
these
acts
crimes?
there's
no
problem
in
the
ross
case.
ross
violated
r.s.
5339,
murder
on
board
in
an
american
vessel.
so
the
only
problem
was,
could
you
try
him
before
the
consul
on
the
spot
or
did
you
have
to
wait
until
the
ship
got
back
to
san
francisco?
what
law
did
these
people
violate?
well,
article
118,
uniform
code,
which
reads,
“any
person
subject
to
this
code.”
well,
how
can
you
make
these
women
subject
to
this
code
unless
you're
prepared
to
say
that
you're
acting
under
the
clause
14
power?
the
clause
--
if
the
clause
14
power
is
adequate
to
--
to
make
accompanying
wives
subject
to
a
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
then
you
have
no
problem,
but
it's
only
under
clause
14
and
it's
only
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
if
she
enlisted
in
the
army,
if
she
enlisted,
then
she'd
be
a
member
of
the
land
and
naval
forces,
if
it
was
a
genuine
enlistment.
after
all,
in
the
old
grimley
case,
the
137
u.s.,
grimley
said,
“well,
he
signed
something
and
he
took
an
oath,
but
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing.”
well,
they
said,
“look,
(inaudible),
you're
--
you're
in
the
army.”
the
difficulty
is
the
one
that
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out.
you
would
find
very
few
wives
that
would
care
to
enlist.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
if
they
are
prepared
to
sign
a
contract
that
will
change
their
status,
i
wouldn't
be
troubled
because
suppose
you
have
a
wife
who's
--
who
doesn't
want
to
go
to
the
café
clutch
party,
she
wants
to
do
something.
she
wants
to
enlist
in
the
(inaudible)
and
she
enlists.
well,
that
subjects
her
to
military
law
regardless
of
her
marital
status
or
where
she's
living
if
the
wife
at
fort
myer
tires
of
the
round
of
parties
and
luncheons,
and
who
wants
to
do
kp
and
be
somebody's
secretary
and
she
enlists
then
she's
subject
to
military
law,
but
these
--
these
women
didn't
enlist.
the
only
contract
they
signed
was
the
marriage
license.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
--
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
you
have
a
hard
time
getting
the
army
to
agree
to
accept
enlistment.
you'd
have
to
have
an
entirely
different
legislation
because
normally
when
someone
enlists,
they
are
entitled
to
pay.
and
the
andrews
case,
i
think
the
240
of
u.s.
says
nobody
can
waive
the
pay.
and
it's
not
enough
to
say,
"well,
we
won't
call
on
you
to
do
any
work."
if
they're
enlisted,
they
are
entitled
to
pay
and
the
deprival
of
pay,
they
have
to
pass
an
act
of
congress
and
if
you
erred
any
such
proposal,
i
rather
suspect,
although,
i
don't
proposed
to
be
--
i
don't
--
i'm
no
expert
on
what
is
--
happens
on
the
other
side
of
the
capitol
plaza.
i
suspect
that
kind
of
legislation
would
have
a
difficult
slate.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
--
the
real
difficulty
under
is
that
unless
you
proceed
under
clause
14,
you
can't
support
the
delegation
to
the
president
under
the
uniform
code
which
alone
makes
that
code
workable.
he
has
got
the
power
to
prescribe
rules
of
procedure.
he
has
the
power
to
prescribe
limits
of
punishment.
he
has
the
power
to
define
military
offenses.
he
has
the
power
to
prescribe
rules
of
evidence.
he
has
the
power
to
fix
standards
of
legal
responsibility,
and
he
only
has
to
follow
the
rule
applicable
except
in
criminal
cases
in
u.s.
district
courts
as
far
as
he
finds
practicum.
now,
the
only
issue
in
both
these
cases
was
whether
these
women
were
legally
responsible
by
reason
of
insanity
and
as
the
printed
records
in
this
case
showed
those
issues
turned
on
the
terms
of
the
manual
for
courts-martial
prescribed
by
the
president
and
the
terms
of
the
manual
entitles
psychiatry
in
military
law
prescribed
by
two
of
the
service
secretaries.
now,
if
the
accused
in
both
cases
had
been
a
member
of
the
land
and
naval
forces,
i
for
one
would
not
be
troubled
by
that
kind
of
uncanalized
delegation
of
legislative
power
because
the
president
is
their
commander-in-chief
but
he
isn't
commander-in-chief
of
civilian
wives.
and
the
president
doesn't
have
this
kind
of
uncontrolled,
uncanalized
legislative
power
over
the
conduct
of
civilian
wives
so
that
what
he
says
determines
whether
they
are
acquitted,
whether
they
go
to
jail
or
whether
they
have
another
trial.
so
that
the
more
--
and
this
is
by
way
of
conclusion,
the
more
this
problem
is
(inaudible),
the
more
you
must
reach
the
conclusion
that
these
trials
cannot
be
supported,
except
as
an
exercise
of
the
clause
14
power.
in
other
words,
the
deeper
you
go
into,
the
longer
you
study,
the
more
you
are
bound
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way,
if
there
is
a
way
to
support
these
trials
is
on
the
basis
on
which
the
prosecutions
were
instituted
and
the
basis
on
which
these
cases
were
defended
at
the
trial
level.
now,
it
is
always
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
that
military
law,
even
with
the
ameliorations
in
mcculloch
still
involves
a
substantial
curtailment
of
protections
available
to
civilians
generally.
fifth
and
--
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
are
substantially
diluted
at
military
law.
there
is
no
right
to
confrontation
at
military
law.
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
why
can
mrs.
covert
now
be
retried
here?
the
reason
is
the
prior
testimony
can
be
used.
this
is
a
trial
by
court-martial.
the
prior
testimony
of
the
english
witnesses
can
be
used
without
producing
those
witnesses
here
or
sending
her
back
to
england.
and
that
as
i
have
said,
there
is
no
bail
at
military
law.
now,
there
were
some
references
by
the
solicitor
general
to
the
nato
reservations.
the
second
senate
reservation
to
the
basic
nato
decree
is
where
a
person
subject
to
the
military
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
is
to
be
tried
by
the
authorities
of
a
receiving
state,
under
the
treaty,
the
commanding
officer
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
u.s.
in
such
state
shall
examine
the
laws
of
such
state
with
particular
reference
to
the
procedural
safeguards
contained
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
what
about
the
procedural
safeguards
for
these
women
that
are
contained
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
are
absent
from
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
open
trial
and
i
think
they
have
the
court
of
military
appeals
recently.
open
trial
except
in
cases
of
indecency
or
security
and
i
think
there
was
a
recent
case
where
the
court
of
military
appeals
set
aside
a
conviction
behind
closed
doors.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
am
--
yes,
because
it's
set
forth
and
the
basic
provisions
are
in
the
manual.
but
even
more
important,
it
is
not
yet
clear,
it
is
not
yet
clear
that
the
person
who
is
subject
to
military
law
has
any
constitutional
protections
at
all.
and
it's
very
unclear
whether
the
person
subject
to
military
law
can
obtain
the
same
kind
of
collateral
review
of
his
constitutional
contentions
that
are
available
to
a
civilian.
now,
we
know
at
the
scope
of
collateral
review
for
--
alleged
constitutional
deprivation
is
here.
johnson
v.
zerbst,
leyra
v.
denno,
but
when
i
have
the
(inaudible)
case
here,
this
term
number
533
trying
to
equate
collateral
review
in
a
court
of
claims,
military
case
with
the
civilian
cases,
certiorari
was
denied.
and
of
course,
i'm
comforted
by
the
thought
that
certiorari
denied
means
nothing
except
to
the
losing
litigant.
but
the
point
is
that
we
still
don't
know
whether
if
these
women
are
subject
to
military
law
and
they
claimed
an
infringement
of
their
constitutional
rights,
they
have
any
right
of
the
same
kind
of
collateral
review
that
they
would
have
if
they've
been
tried
in
a
state
or
federal
court.
now,
i
am
not
troubled
by
the
fact
that
we
deny
many
freedoms
to
those
in
uniform
because
after
all,
the
whole
purpose,
the
whole
purpose
of
a
military
code
is
to
be
a
deterrent
disciplinary
force
that
will
send
thousands
of
people
obediently
to
their
death
if
need
be.
but
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
empowers
the
withholding
of
those
freedoms
and
of
those
protections
from
civilian
women
and
civilian
children?
the
government
has
never
yet
faced
up
to
the
question
of
what
you
do
with
the
teenage
child
who
killed
someone.
what
do
you
do
with
him?
he
is
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial
under
all
these
arguments.
he
is
a
defendant.
we
don't
even
know
what
is
the
age
of
criminal
responsibility.
of
course,
it
isn't
covered
in
the
code
of
the
manual,
those
aren't
adopted.
those
aren't
provisions
adopted
to
trial
of
children.
but
to
return
to
the
basic
question,
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
permits
all
these
protections
to
be
withdrawn
from
these
women
simply
because
they're
overseas
with
their
husbands
and
rationed
by
the
armed
forces?
that
question,
if
the
court
please,
has
not
yet
been
answered
from
any
source.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
military
file
of
civilians
is
utterly
foreign
to
our
condition.
and
if
we
go
back
to
the
petition
of
right
in
1628,
rather
than
mr.
blumenthal's
letter
in
the
back
of
the
government's
brief
and
i
want
to
say,
i
cannot
accept
that
hearsay
letter.
it
was
written
in
response
to
a
request.
the
gentleman
says,
"i
hope
this
is
what
you
want."
apparently,
it
was
because
they
printed
it.
he's
not
listed
in
our
martindale-hubbell
so
he
is
not
a
lawyer.
and
it
doesn't
give
any
documentation
and
i
just
can't
accept
that
as
setting
forth
the
practice
anymore
than
i
can
accept
the
--
the
talk
given
by
the
lady
vice
president
of
the
local
historical
society
about
the
legends
of
the
neighborhood.
you
go
back
--
go
back
to
the
petition
of
right.
go
back
to
the
--
go
back
to
the
declaration
of
independence.
go
to
our
constitutional
convention.
go
to
the
ratifying
conventions
where
we
had
this
endemic
struggle
over
--
is
militia
enough
or
do
we
have
to
--
do
we
dare
have
a
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
and
that's
still
a
live
question.
the
current
national
guard
controversy
is
the
heritage
of
that
old,
instinctive
fear
of
the
standing
army.
but
turning
specifically
to
these
trials
now
under
consideration,
they've
always
been
struck
down
by
this
court
whenever
the
1789
boundaries
of
jury
trial
had
been
exceeded.
yes,
there
were
trials
by
military
commission
in
the
civil
war
until
the
milligan
case
came
along.
the
lincoln
conspirators
were
tried
by
military
commission
here
in
the
district.
i
think
in
retrospect
that
was
probably
is
greater
block
on
our
history
of
the
assassination
itself
and
it's
--
thereafter
that
you
get
in
the
pages
of
winthrop
in
the
jag
opinions
that
are
set
forth
in
appendix
b,
the
latest
government
brief.
you
get
the
spirit
of
legality,
the
--
the
military
in
strict
placing
itself.
self
disciplining
itself
in
strict
subordination
to
the
civil
power
and
to
the
clauses
of
the
constitution,
and
when
the
martial
law
case
came
up
in
duncan
against
kahanamoku,
martial
law
in
hawaii,
there
was
a
tenable
narrow
ground
sent
forth
in
chief
justice
stone's
opinion.
he
said,
“i
don't
think
there
was
enough
necessity
here
to
warrant
it,”
but
the
majority
of
the
court
put
it
on
the
broader
ground
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
our
tradition
because
there
is
a
change
in
the
boundary.
and
if
you
want
a
laboratory
test
of
whether
it
is
desirable
to
shift
that
boundary,
then
i
recommend
a
reading
of
these
rather
short
records
in
this
case
and
you'll
see
how
these
women
were
dealt
with
and
ask
yourselves
as
you
read
the
short
record.
this
isn't
the
big
record
of
trial
by
court-martial,
this
are
just
the
appellate
opinions.
i'd
like
your
honors
to
ask
yourselves
as
you
read
those
opinions,
whether
in
any
american
civil
court,
federal,
or
state,
or
territorial,
these
women
would
have
been
treated
this
way
with
the
same
result.
i
say
that
to
sustain
these
trials
does
violence
to
the
tradition
of
the
founders.
it
does
violence
to
the
constitution.
it
does
violence
to
the
heritage
of
all
its
expositors
up
to
now.
but
perhaps
more
immediately,
pertinent
is
the
circumstance
to
--
that
to
sustain
these
trials
is
utterly
inconsistent
with
toth.
now,
toth
was
not
in
the
united
states
when
the
writ
was
sought
on
his
behalf.
he
was
in
korea.
he
was
on
foreign
soil.
congress
plainly
intended
to
reach
his
case.
toth
plainly
had
violated
article
118,
ucmj,
because
he
was
the
person
subject
to
this
code
when
he
killed
that
poor
korean.
he
was
accompanying
the
forces
overseas
and
their
jurisdiction
wasn't
lessened
by
the
fact
that
he'd
been
brought
there
forcibly.
now,
the
rationale
of
last
june's
opinion,
that
congress
can
punish
crimes
committed
abroad
can
put
the
accused
on
trial
before
american
courts-martial
that
it
doesn't
have
to
extend
them
to
trial
by
jury.
that
rationale
was
certainly
is
fully
applicable
to
toth
as
it
was
to
these
women.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
would
say
as
the
solicitor
general
said
two
years
ago,
we
think
the
constitutional
case
is
if
anything
clearer
for
the
court-martial
of
toth
who
was
a
soldier
at
the
time
of
his
offense
than
it
is
for
a
civilian
accompanying
the
armed
forces.
i
would
have
less
difficulty
in
saying
that
the
power
to
govern
the
land
and
naval
forces
includes
the
power
to
punish
someone
who
was
a
member
of
those
forces
when
he
committed
his
offense
and
try
him
by
court-martial
when
his
offense
was
discovered
afterwards,
than
to
say
that
the
power
to
govern
the
armed
forces
includes
a
power
of
disciplining
the
wives
of
members
of
those
forces.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
i
--
i
do
not
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
i
don't
quarrel
necessarily.
of
course,
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
toth
case.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
toth
reason
that
--
that
the
reasoning
last
june
in
these
cases
would
have
reached
toth.
and
i
think
it
would
have
reached
him
even
if
the
red
hat
had
been
sought
when
he
was
still
in
the
united
states,
when
he
was
fighting
extradition
because
under
the
rationale
of
last
june,
he
would
have
been
fighting
extradition
to
a
legislative
court.
there's
never
been
any
problem
about
that.
we've
had
extradition
to
legislative
courts
since
the
1790.
and
there's
no
problem
about
extraditing
him
to
a
military
government
court.
that's
nearly
the
ankle.
that's
all
it
is.
and
so,
i
say
again,
it
was
the
reasoning
of
the
court's
opinion
last
june
was
ample
to
withhold
toth.
i
would
like
now
to
refer
briefly
to
a
point
that
was
not
argued
last
year.
i
very
much
hope
your
honors
will
never
have
reason
to
come
to
it.
but
on
the
assumption
that
the
jurisdiction
has
upheld,
i
put
the
proposition
that
it
was
lost
in
the
covert
case.
she
is
to
be
retried
in
the
district
of
columbia,
unless
the
opinion
is
set
aside.
he
is
to
be
retried
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
bolling
field
air
force
base,
literally
within
the
shadow
of
the
capitol
dome.
now,
i
don't
question
in
any
degree
that
this
rehearing
is
the
continuation
of
the
original
proceeding.
i've
never
questioned
that.
i
couldn't
question
it
of
course.
but
how,
i
ask,
how
can
you
support
the
military
trial
of
a
civilian
in
the
district
of
columbia?
last
june,
the
court
said,
“we
hold
only
that
military
jurisdiction,
once
validly
attached
continues
until
final
disposition
of
the
case.”
now,
where
there
has
been
an
expiration
of
a
term
of
enlistment
or
the
termination
of
a
commission
by
operation
of
law
with
no
affirmative
act
by
the
government
in
either
instance,
then
it's
perfectly
clear
that
military
jurisdiction
does
contain.
but
ever
since
1862,
the
military
rulings
have
been
consistent
on
this
one
point,
that
whenever
military
status
is
destroyed
by
affirmative
act
of
the
government
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings,
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings,
military
jurisdiction
is
gone.
now,
the
only
assumption
on
which
mrs.
covert
could
have
been
subject
to
military
jurisdiction
was
while
she
was
accompanying
the
forces
overseas.
now,
that
is
a
military
jurisdiction,
geographically
limited
in
space
just
as
the
traditional
military
jurisdiction
over
civilians
from
the
continental
congress
down
to
1960
was
limited
in
time.
now,
when
the
government
removed
her
back
to
within
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states,
that
jurisdiction
was
gone.
and
once
her
conviction
was
set
aside
as
it
was,
she
wasn't
subject
to
trial
by
court-martial
anymore.
and
the
same
result
follows
when
you
compare
the
custody
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
with
the
provisions
of
the
former
articles
of
war.
under
article
of
war
2
(e)
of
1916
on,
i'll
get
a
very
short
provision
so
i'll
quote
them
accurately.
under
the
articles
of
war,
all
persons
under
sentence
of
judge
by
courts-martial
were
subject
to
military
law
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference
where
the
place
of
confinement
was.
the
question
was
what
court?
what
kind
of
tribunal
imposed
the
sentence?
and
if
it
--
they
were
serving
a
sentence
by
court-martial,
they
were
subject
to
military
law
no
matter
where
that
was
being
served.
but
in
the
uniform
code,
article
2
(7),
it
makes
the
code
applicable
only
to
all
persons
in
custody
of
the
armed
forces
serving
a
sentence
imposed
by
court-martial.
and
when
they
are
no
longer
under
the
custody
of
the
armed
forces,
then
article
58
(a)
of
the
uniform
code
says,
“persons
confined
in
a
penal
or
correctional
institution
not
under
the
control
of
one
of
the
armed
forces
shall
be
subject
to
the
same
discipline
and
treatment
as
persons
confined
or
committed
by
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
so
forth.”
so
that
when
mrs.
covert
was
placed
in
civilian
custody,
when
she
was
first
in
the
custody
of
the
department
of
justice
in
alderson,
there
in
the
custody
of
the
d.c.
government
of
the
district
jail
and
then
on
the
custody
of
department
of
health,
education
and
so
forth
when
she
was
at
saint
elizabeth.
when
she
was
placed
in
civilian
custody
by
the
very
terms
of
the
express
and
explicit
terms
of
the
uniform
code,
she
was
no
longer
subject
to
military
law.
and
having
been
placed
there,
the
jurisdiction
terminated
and
when
the
conviction
was
set
aside,
she
couldn't
be
tried
again.
now,
there's
a
talk
in
the
briefs
about
well
--
the
air
force
indicated
an
intent
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
her
by
confining
her.
well,
i
don't
think
it's
particularly
helpful
to
attempt
to
attribute
intent
to
collective
organization,
but
if
anyone
thinks
that
it's
--
in
any
degree
helpful
to
talk
in
those
terms,
then
i
would
respond
that
one
intends
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
--
of
one's
act
and
that
when
you
put
a
military
prisoner
in
a
civilian
institution
that
are
no
longer
military
prisoners.
now,
of
course,
this
kind
of
consequence
wouldn't
follow
if
you
put
a
soldier
in
one
of
mr.
j.v.
bennett's
lodging
places,
because
he
would
stil
have
a
military
status
even
if
his
enlistment
there
expired,
if
his
enlistment
had
expired
possibly
that
would
be
some
problem
but
if
his
discharge
hadn't
been
executed,
his
status
wouldn't
be
changed
and
there
you
have
a
further
illustration
of
the
inappropriateness
of
this
uniform
code
of
military
justice
as
an
instrumentality
of
dealing
with
civilians.
now,
let's
go
to
some
documented
history
again.
the
last
civilian
woman
tried
by
military
tribunal
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
mrs.
surratt
in
1865,
and
mrs.
surratt
did
what
mrs.
covert
did.
she
got
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
a
judge
here
at
the
courthouse.
and
now,
what
was
the
response
that
the
government
made
to
that
judge's
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
behalf
of
mrs.
surratt?
an
executive
order
signed
by
the
president
with
suspending
the
privilege
of
the
writ.
that
is
in
--
then
fit
from
stenographic
report
of
the
trial
of
the
lincoln
conspirators
at
page
250,
not
in
the
blumenthal
letter.
pretty
shocking,
isn't
it,
pretty
shocking
that
when
the
judge
issues
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
a
specific
case
that
he's
met
with
an
executive
order
suspending
the
writ.
but
wouldn't
it
be
more
shocking
if
a
woman
were
now
to
be
tried
by
a
court-martial
in
the
district
of
columbia
with
the
blessing
of
this
court
and
its
approval.
if
your
honors
please,
i've
tried
to
argue
this
case
with
some
degree
of
objectivity.
i've
tried
to
put
out
in
mind
as
nearly
as
i
can
the
callous
and
somewhat
obtuse
cruelty
with
which
these
two
women
were
treated
because
i
felt
that
i
could
best
discharge
my
duties
to
this
court
as
well
as
my
duty
to
them
by
dealing
with
this
as
a
question
of
constitutional
law
which
calls
for
research
and
reflection
and
cogitation.
i
can't
conceal
my
concern
over
the
seriousness
of
what's
involved
because
this
--
this
is
about
as
fundamental
an
issue
as
has
ever
come
before
this
court
and
certainly
more
vital
and
fundamental
in
the
constitutional
sense
than
any
that's
been
here
for
some
years.
and
it's
fundamental
and
vital
because
it
poses
in
start
immediacy
the
question
of
how
far
we
may
properly
brace
ourselves
to
withstand
an
assault
from
without
and
yet
perhaps
sow
the
seeds
of
our
own
disintegration
within.
because
we
have
here,
i
think
for
the
first
time
the
question
involving
the
impact
on
the
one
hand
of
the
supposed
needs
of
the
garrison
state
upon
on
the
other
the
immutable
principles
of
a
free
nation.
that's
a
quotation,
“the
immutable
principles
of
a
free
nation,”
not
from
the
writings
of
some
cloistered
libertarian
philosopher,
but
from
the
institution
of
the
order
of
the
cincinnati
which
was
founded
in
1783
by
the
revolutionary
officers
who
had
pledged
their
lives
and
shed
their
blood
that
this
country
might
be
born.
and
i
think
we
will
be
aided
in
the
resolution
of
that
problem
by
considering
two
sentences
from
the
late
mr.
justice
cardozo's
immortal
classic,
“the
nature
of
the
judicial
process.”
the
great
ideals
of
liberty
and
equality
are
preserved
against
the
assaults
of
opportunism,
the
expediency
of
the
passing
hour,
the
erosion
of
small
encroachments,
the
scorn
and
derision
of
those
who
have
no
patience
with
general
principles
by
enshrining
them
in
constitutions,
and
consecrating
to
the
task
of
their
protection,
a
body
of
defenders.
by
conscious
or
subconscious
influence,
the
presence
of
this
restraining
power,
aloof
in
the
background,
but
nonetheless,
always
in
reserve,
tends
to
stabilize
and
rationalize
the
legislative
judgment
to
infuse
it
with
the
glow
of
principle,
to
hold
the
standard
aloft
invisible
for
those
who
must
run
the
race
and
keep
the
faith.”
if
your
honors
please,
i
have
been
enrolled
among
the
body
of
defenders.
i
hope
this
court
will
keep
the
faith.
