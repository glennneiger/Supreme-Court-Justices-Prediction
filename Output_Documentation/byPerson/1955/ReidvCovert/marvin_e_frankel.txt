mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
may
it
please
the
court.
the
important
question
common
to
both
of
these
consolidated
cases
is
whether
congress
violated
the
constitution
when
it
provided
40
years
ago
and
again
in
article
2
(11)
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
that
civilians
accompanying
the
armed
forces
outside
the
united
states,
where
foreign
courts
would
normally
have
jurisdiction,
could
be
tried
by
an
american
courts-martial
for
their
offenses
in
those
foreign
places
where
international
law
or
international
agreement
permit.
the
covert
case,
number
701,
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
where
mrs.
covert
was
ordered
discharged
on
habeas
corpus.
in
march
1953
and
for
sometime
theretofore,
mrs.
covert
was
living
on
an
american
air
force
base
in
england.
she
had
been
brought
to
england
by
military
service
transport.
she
had
come
to
england
under
statute
and
regulations
providing
that
dependents
of
armed
forces
personnel
overseas
might,
in
stated
circumstances,
come
overseas
to
live
with
them.
as
such
a
dependent
living
on
the
air
force
base,
mrs.
covert
used
commissary
facilities,
post-exchange
and
other
military
facilities,
medical
and
so
on
and
lived
with
her
husband
in
quarters
furnished
by
the
military.
on
march
10,
1953,
mrs.
covert
killed
her
husband
with
an
axe.
at
that
time,
there
was
in
effect
an
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
and
a
british
statute
implementing
that
agreement,
both
of
which
are
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
the
covert
case
beginning
at
page
74.
under
that
agreement
for
the
duration
of
the
war
and
for
such
further
period
as
the
parties
might
agree
which
ultimately
extended
to
the
time
as
relevant
in
this
case.
the
united
kingdom
agreed
to
relinquish
its
normal
local
jurisdiction
over
american
person
subject
--
over
a
person
subject
to
american
military
law
in
england.
and
the
united
kingdom
agreed
that
american
military
tribunals
might
exercise
in
england
their
military
jurisdiction
over
such
persons
for
offenses
committed
in
england.
in
accordance
with
that
agreement,
a
certificate
was
made
by
the
commanding
officer
of
the
air
force
base
stating
that
mrs.
covert
was
a
person
subject
to
american
military
law.
the
british,
thereafter,
refrained
from
taking
any
action
with
reference
to
this
murder
and
mrs.
covert
was
tried
by
court-martial.
she
was
convicted.
her
conviction
was
affirmed
by
a
board
of
review
in
a
divided
vote,
2-to-1.
thereafter,
her
conviction
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
military
appeals,
again
in
a
divided
vote
on
two
grounds
which
are
not
important
here
but
which
might
be
mentioned.
one,
that
prosecution
witnesses
had
misinterpreted
and
misapplied
in
air
force
manual
on
the
question
of
legal
insanity
in
giving
their
testimony,
and
two,
that
the
law
officer
of
the
court-martial
had
erred
in
failing
to
instruct
on
mental
impairment
as
affecting
premeditation
as
well
as
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
totally.
on
the
reversal,
the
court
of
military
appeals
ordered
that
there
be
a
rehearing
if
practicable.
thereafter,
such
a
rehearing
was
ordered.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
impracticable
means
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
if
in
the
judgment
of
the
prosecuting
authorities,
there
is
reason
to
hold
a
rehearing
if
it
would
be
just
to
do
so
if
the
other
man
is
warranted.
and
this
leads
to
the
convening
authority
the
power
to
determine
whether
there's
a
rehearing
and
there's
no
--
no
issue
as
to
that.
and
meanwhile
to
trace
the
location
of
mrs.
covert
during
this
offense
as
to
which
a
non-constitutional
issue
was
raised,
they
can
be
summarized
as
follows.
on
june
--
in
june,
1953,
following
her
conviction,
mrs.
covert,
following
her
conviction
but
before
review
in
the
military
appellate
tribunal,
mrs.
covert
was
flown
in
air
force
custody
from
england
and
confined
in
the
federal
reformatory
for
women
at
alderson,
west
virginia.
she
remained
there
until
after
the
rehearing
was
ordered.
when
she
was
brought
to
the
district
of
columbia,
the
rehearing
having
been
ordered
to
be
held
at
bolling
air
force
base
near
here.
here,
because
the
air
force
did
not
have
appropriate
facilities,
it
arranged
as
everybody
apparently
agrees
was
its
right
for
her
confinement
in
the
district
of
columbia
jail
of
which
the
appellant
curtis
reid
is
superintendent.
then
before
the
rehearing,
which
was
scheduled
to
take
place
sometime
in
november
1955
and
10
days
after
this
court's
decision
in
toth
against
quarles,
this
--
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
filed.
on
november
22nd,
on
the
return
day
of
the
writ,
judge
tamm
held
that
toth
against
quarles
required
the
invalidation
of
article
2
(11)
and
ordered
mrs.
covert
--
covert's
release.
now,
in
number
713,
the
krueger
case,
the
facts
are
strikingly
similar
and
for
our
purposes
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
constitutional
issue,
substantially
identical.
mrs.
dorothy
krueger
smith,
the
daughter
of
the
respondent
in
number
713,
general
krueger,
who
brought
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
on
her
behalf,
mrs.
dorothy
krueger
smith
killed
her
husband
on
october
4,
1952
in
japan.
like
mrs.
covert
in
england,
mrs.
smith
had
gone
to
japan
to
live
with
her
husband,
an
army
colonel.
she
lived
in
government
provided
quarters
at
a
place
called
washington
heights,
an
american
installation
in
tokyo,
used
government
commissary,
post-exchange,
medical
and
other
facilities.
in
her
case,
the
basis
for
the
exercise
of
american
military
jurisdiction
was
a
security
treaty
with
japan
and
an
administrative
agreement
thereunder
whereby
japan
agreed
to
the
exercise
of
such
jurisdiction
by
american
military
courts
of
a
person
subject
to
american
military
law.
mrs.
smith
was
convicted
by
the
court-martial,
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
and
her
conviction
has
been
affirmed
by
all
the
military
appellate
tribunals.
her
conviction
was
finally
affirmed
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
on
december
30,
1954.one
year
later,
in
december
1955,
again
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
toth,
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
denied.
in
this
case,
which
came
before
judge
moore
in
west
virginia,
it
was
held
that
toth
was
not
applicable,
that
article
2
(11)
was
constitutional
and
that
she
was
probably
--
properly
held
under
the
sentence
of
the
court-marital.
now,
at
the
outset
of
number
701,
the
covert
case
on
direct
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
1252,
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
obedient
to
this
court's
rules,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
briefly
first
to
that
question.
now,
section
1252
of
title
28,
under
which
we
have
brought
this
appeal,
appears
in
the
government's
brief
in
number
701
at
pages
2
and
3.
it
provides
that
there
may
be
an
appeal
from
any
judgment,
decree
or
order
of
any
court
of
the
united
states
holding
any
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
in
any
civil
action
suit
or
proceeding
and
here
we
reach
the
controverted
words.
any
suit,
action
or
proceeding
to
which
the
united
states
or
any
of
its
agencies
or
any
officer
or
employee
thereof
as
such
officer
or
employee
is
a
party.
now,
the
appellee
claims
that
curtis
reid,
being
the
superintendent
of
the
district
of
columbia
jail
is
not
the
type
of
party
within
that
final
language
warranting
this
direct
appeal,
that
because
he
is
an
employee
of
the
district
of
columbia,
he
cannot
here
be
viewed
as
an
employee
of
the
united
states
or
one
of
its
agencies
and
the
appeal
therefore
must
be
dismissed.
now,
the
reason
and
purpose
of
this
jurisdictional
statute
are,
of
course,
familiar
to
the
court.
as
the
court
said
in
fleming
against
rhodes,
its
purpose
was
to
provide
the
federal
government
with
proper
view
by
this
highest
tribunal
of
cases
where
acts
of
congress
had
been
held
unconstitutional.
there
is
no
question
that
that
standard
is
met
here.
the
same
statute
enacted
in
1937
provided
in
what
is
now
28
u.s.c.
2403,
for
a
notification
to
the
attorney
general
in
any
action
where
a
federal
statute
was
being
drawn
in
question
where
the
united
states
or
an
agency
or
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states
or
an
agency
was
not
a
party.
the
obvious
purpose
there
being
to
avoid
the
invalidation
of
federal
statutes
behind
the
back
of
the
government's
responsible
officers
as
it
were.
now,
that
aspect
of
what
congress
sought
is
met
here
too.
the
attorney
general
has
been
in
this
suit
from
the
outset.
there
was
no
notice
to
the
attorney
general.
there
was
no
occasion
for
it.
we
think
it
was
not
an
accident
that
the
attorney
general
was
here.
everybody,
our
opponents,
as
well
as
we,
have
assumed
from
the
outset
that
curtis
reid
was
an
officer
who
could
properly
interpose
the
authority
of
the
united
states
and
against
whom
the
appellee
could
test
the
authority
of
the
united
states
in
a
way
that
would
bind
the
united
states
and
all
its
officers.
now,
we
think
you
can
reach
the
result
of
holding
that
the
jurisdiction
exists
by
two
rules.
one,
by
holding
as
we
think
would
be
perfectly
proper
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
curtis
reid
is
an
employee
of
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
and
two,
by
holding
alternatively
or
also
that
he
is
an
employee
of
the
united
states
directly.
first,
it
is
familiar,
of
course,
in
particular
context
to
refer
to
the
district
of
columbia
as
an
agency
of
the
united
states.
there
are
contexts
where
that
is
not
true.
the
meaning
of
the
word
"agency"
of
the
united
states,
the
propriety
of
using
the
word
"agency"
must,
of
course,
be
determined
by
the
purpose
for
which
the
question
is
asked.
here,
where
curtis
reid
obviously
exercised
air
force
authority,
general
federal
authority
on
behalf
of
the
air
force,
in
turn
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
we
think
it
appropriate
to
consider
the
district
of
columbia
jail
or
the
district
of
columbia
an
agency
of
the
united
states
and
curtis
reid
an
employee
of
such
an
agency.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
there
is
a
difference
and
that
the
district
of
columbia
jail
is
under
the
department
of
corrections,
i
believe
it's
called,
under
ultimately
the
commissioners
of
the
district
of
columbia.
but
it
is
in
many
respects
a
jail
of
the
united
states.
its
activities
and
the
confinement
of
prisoners
therein
are
supervised
by
statute
by
the
attorney
general
who
determines
what
prisoners
should
be
assigned
there
and
what
prisoners
should
be
assigned
elsewhere.
offenses
in
the
district
of
columbia
are
offenses
against
the
united
states
and
the
terms
and
the
place
of
confinement
are
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general.
now,
here,
the
action
was
taken
on
behalf
of
the
air
force.
this
was
air
force
custody
as
our
opponent
recognize
when
he
wanted
the
custody
changed.
he
wanted
mrs.
covert
taken
to
st.
elizabeth's
for
sanity
test
which
was
made
and
were
--
she
was
determined
to
be
sane.
he
addressed
his
request
to
the
air
force
and
the
air
force
took
the
necessary
action.and
that
leads
to
our
second
point.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
the
attorney
general
may
designate
for
federal
prisoners,
any
available,
suitable
and
appropriate
institutions
whether
maintained
by
district
of
columbia,
the
federal
government
or
otherwise.
and
if
he
determines
that
the
district
of
columbia
jail
was
appropriate,
curtis
reid
takes
the
prison.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
he
must
take
them
to
prison.
now,
there's
been
no
issue
and
i
cannot
say
as
flattening
that
curtis
reid
must
take
an
air
force
prisoner.
i
think
the
issue
would
never
arise.
nobody
has
ever
questioned
the
propriety
of
what
was
put
as
a
request
by
the
air
force.
curtis
reid
acted
for
the
air
force.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
article
2
(11)
is
valid.
curtis
reid
is
here
claiming
his
right
to
hold
her
under
article
2
(11)
or
the
consequences
of
article
2
(11).
now,
curtis
reid
may
also
be
viewed
as
an
employee
of
the
united
states
directly.
this
court
said
long
ago
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stewart
that
even
where
a
federal
prisoner
is
confined
in
a
state
jail,
the
keeper
of
the
state
jail
for
that
purpose
may
be
viewed
as
the
keeper
of
the
united
states.
we
quote
that
at
page
24
and
unfortunately
for
ourselves
we
left
out
the
next
sentence
which
is
also
interesting,
it
says,
but
this
--
this
fact,
the
state
keeper
is
the
keeper
of
the
united
states
would
no
more
make
the
marshal,
who
was
involved
in
that
case,
liable
for
his
acts
then
for
the
acts
of
any
other
officer
of
the
united
states
whose
appointment
is
all
together
independent.
now,
there
in
another
context
it's
true,
the
state
keeper
was
referred
to
expressly
as
an
officer
of
the
united
states.
here,
where
curtis
reid
asserts
federal
custody
under
a
general
federal
statute,
we
say
he
acts
as
an
officer
of
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
all
of
the
purposes
of
which
are
clearly
served
by
holding
that
this
appeal
properly
lies
to
this
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
with
that
to
the
important
common
question
in
these
cases,
the
validity
of
article
2
(11).
judge
tamm
in
his
opinion
from
the
bench
on
the
return
day
of
the
writ
held
that
article
2
(11)
had
to
be
invalidated
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
toth
against
quarles,
which
he
said
has
virtually
turned
inside
out,
a
great
many
earlier
decisions
specially
in
courts
of
appeal
and
in
u.s.
district
courts.
in
this,
judge
tamm
was
reflecting
the
views
of
colonel
wiener,
my
opponent,
himself
an
eminent
military
lawyer
who
had
pointed
out
to
judge
tamm
and
also
pointed
out
to
judge
moore
in
the
krueger
case
that
the
filing
of
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
the
direct
result
of
the
toth
decision,
that
he
had
handled
these
cases
for
covert,
i
believe
both
of
them,
certainly
covert,
in
the
military
appellate
tribunals
and
had
not
raised
any
question
about
the
validity
of
article
2
(11)
but,
said
colonel
wiener,
the
toth
case
very
much
shook
the
thinking
of
military
lawyers
thus
explaining
these
petitions
filed
so
promptly
thereafter.
now,
it
would
be
my
purpose
to
show
that
this
case
is
not
ruled
at
all
by
toth
and
that
the
40-year
old
provision,
which
is
now
article
2
(11),
is
clearly
within
the
powers
of
congress.
and
i
would
like
to
pursue
to
make
that
showing,
two
main
lines
of
argument.
first,
i
shall
argue
that
under
the
settled
principles
stated
in
this
court's
decision
in
in
re
ross.
congress
has
power
to
provide
for
a
trial
in
a
foreign
country
for
an
offense
committed
in
that
foreign
country
where
that
foreign
country
will
somehow
relinquish
its
own
jurisdiction
without
granting
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
or
without
requiring
an
indictment.
i
shall
argue
further
that
article
2
(11)
is
sustained
by
the
power
of
congress
in
article
1
(a)
in
clause
14,
the
power
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
under
the
war
power
and
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
which
gives
congress
the
power
to
enact,
although
it's
necessary
and
proper
for
its
own
powers
and
for
powers
which
reside
elsewhere
in
the
government
including
the
president's
powers
as
commander-in-chief
and
our
organ
of
foreign
relations.
now,
first,
the
point
--
and
in
--
in
making
these
points,
it
will
be
my
effort
throughout
to
indicate
at
the
appropriate
places
where
we
think
the
toth
decision
is
clearly
distinguishable.
now,
in
the
toth
case,
this
court
said
and
i
think
this
might
be
regarded
as
the
main
theme
of
the
opinion
that
where
you
were
dealing
with
a
person
like
toth,
with
a
civilian
ex-service
man
who
had
no
more
relationship
with
the
military
and
who
would
normally,
like
toth,
be
within
the
united
states
when
a
military
jurisdiction
was
asserted
over
them.
this
court
said
in
such
a
situation
any
expansion
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
like
that
in
the
1950
act,
article
3
(a),
necessarily
encroaches
on
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
setup
under
article
3
of
the
constitution.
now
here,
we
say
there
is
no
such
encroachment
for
a
trial
in
a
foreign
country
for
an
offense
committed
in
that
foreign
country
where
congress
by
agreement
or
international
law
can
obtain
jurisdiction
from
that
foreign
country.
there
is
no
right
to
trial
in
an
article
3
court,
to
trial
by
jury
followed
only
by
indictment
or
even
to
trial
by
--
or
to
trial
by
judges
with
life
tenure.
and
that
principle,
we
think,
is
made
clear
by
the
decision
in
in
re
ross.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
that
case
there
was
a
seaman
on
an
american
ship
charged
with
a
murder
of
the
ship's
officer
in
the
court
of
yokohoma.under
a
treaty,
japan
had
relinquished
to
the
united
states
its
--
its
jurisdiction
over
offenses
committed
by
americans
in
japan.
a
federal
statute,
a
statute
of
congress
authorized
the
exercise
of
this
jurisdiction
in
japan
and
other
countries
by
consular
tribunals.
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
merely
on
the
sworn
complaint
of
the
ship's
captain,
ross
was
brought
to
trial
before
the
consul
and
four
associates
drawn
by
the
consul
from
a
list
kept
for
that
purpose.
he
was
sentenced
to
death,
a
sentence
later
commuted
to
life
imprisonment
by
the
president.
here,
he
contented
that
his
sentence
was
unlawful,
unconstitutional,
he
had
no
indictment,
no
trial
by
jury.
this
court
in
a
unanimous
decision
by
mr.
justice
field
rejected
those
contentions.
it
held
that
in
this
situation,
congress
could
validly
provide
for
a
non-article
3
trial
of
the
type
ross
had
had,
that
where
these
arrangements
were
made
between
this
country
and
another
country
and
where
our
officers
were
given
jurisdiction
to
exercise
in
a
foreign
country
the
right
of
indictment,
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
is
not
applied.
the
court
used
very
sweeping
language
to
the
effect
that
the
constitution
does
not
--
the
world
receives.
now,
we
--
the
court
need
not
reiterate
language
quite
that
broad
to
hold
as
we
believe
that
the
particular
principles
of
in
re
ross
are
squarely
applicable
here
and
require
sustaining
article
2
(11).
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor.
there
were
other
deficiencies
in
the
--
in
the
brief
in
toth.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
there
may
have
been
other
deficiencies
in
the
brief
in
toth
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
that
colonel
wiener
relies
on
here
but
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
we
might
have
invoked
it
to
some
extent
but,
of
course,
it
was
not
applicable.
the
jurisdiction,
the
military
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
ross
decision
would
not
have
been
applicable
in
toth.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
because
the
military
jurisdiction
we
asserted
there
was
asserted
in
the
united
states
where
toth
was
apprehended
and
whence
he
was
brought
to
korea.
now,
the
analogy
would
be
if
mrs.
covert's
murder
of
her
husband
had
not
been
discovered
and
if
she
had
come
back
to
the
united
states,
under
article
3
(a)
which
the
court
struck
down
in
toth,
there
would
have
been
continuing
military
jurisdiction
but
that
can
no
longer
be
exercised
at
the
courts.
here,
you
have
jurisdiction
which
is
designed
to
operate
only
outside
the
united
states
where
foreign
countries
normally
have
jurisdiction
and
was
so
applied
here,
so
applied
in
mrs.
covert's
case
and
in
mrs.
krueger's.
now,
the
rule
of
the
ross
case
has
never
been
questioned
and
we
think
it's
not
seriously
questioned
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
been
reaffirmed
on
several
occasions
cited
in
our
briefs.
indeed,
the
decisions
of
this
court
go
further.
they
hold
that
in
unincorporated
territories
and
possessions
which
are
not
foreign
countries
but
are
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states,
even
there
congress
need
not
provide
for
indictment
jury
trial,
judges
with
life
tenure.
now,
the
appellee,
as
nearly
as
i
can
understand
it,
attempts
to
distinguish
the
ross
case
only
on
the
ground
that
ross
involved
consular
courts
and
here
we
deal
with
courts-martial.
we
think
the
distinction
must
fail.
the
constitution
makes
no
mention
of
consular
courts
at
all.
the
principles
that
justified
the
kind
of
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
exercised
in
ross
applies
perfectly
here
nor
will
a
comparison
between
the
consular
courts
and
their
exercise
of
jurisdiction
and
the
military
courts
and
their
exercises
of
jurisdiction
favor
the
appellee.
now,
if
you
compare
the
provisions
of
the
revised
statutes
mentioned
in
the
ross
decision
which
are
now
still
on
the
statute
books
found
in
title
22
of
the
u.s.
code
beginning
at
section
141.
if
you
compare
those
provisions
with
the
careful
detail
safeguarded
provisions
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
the
comparison
must
necessarily
be
favorable
to
the
uniform
code.
you
may
note
the
fact
that
consuls
who
were
given
this
consular
jurisdiction
over
much
of
our
history
were
frequently
not
lawyers.
the
code
provides
for
judicial
officers
and
counsel
in
important
cases
who
are
trained
lawyers.
you
will
note
that
the
consular
courts,
the
consuls
and
the
courts
that
they
set
up
ad
hoc
had
no
special
relationship
to
the
people
they
were
empowered
to
try.
as
i
shall
emphasize
more
fully
later,
the
military
tribunals
which
try
americans
accompanying
and
living
with
the
armed
forces
overseas
have
a
direct
and
important
concern
with
the
control
and
the
discipline
of
such
people.
now,
in
these
cases
and
today
with
some
60
countries
we
have
agreements
providing
for
the
exercise
of
this
kind
of
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
in
the
foreign
countries
where
our
troupes
are
stationed.
now,
the
problem
of
these
agreements
has
presented
difficult
and
disputed
questions
of
policy
in
our
congress
and
among
the
public.
there
were
some
who
say
that
all
of
these
cases
were
to
be
left
to
the
foreign
countries
to
try,
all
these
countries
all
over
the
world.
mrs.
covert
having
been
tried
by
an
american
military
tribunal
now
says
she'd
have
preferred
that.
there
were
some
who's
saying
on
the
other
hand
and
this
problem
is,
i
assume,
well
known
to
the
court
and
is
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
hearings
and
so
forth.
there
are
some
who
say
that
we
have
already
relinquished
too
much
jurisdiction
over
american
nationals
in
these
places
where
we
set
up
military
establishments
and
that
we
must
denounce
these
agreements
and
somehow
get
these
foreign
countries
to
give
all
the
jurisdiction
to
our
american
military
tribunals.
now,
these
problem
of
high
international
policy
is
of
course
not
one
to
be
resolved
here
as
a
policy
matter.
but
what
we
say
is
that
if
article
2
(11)
is
struck
down,
if
this
provision
which
empowers
our
officers
to
exercise
this
american
jurisdiction
when
they
can
get
it
by
agreement
overseas,
if
this
provision
is
struck
down,
this
problem
will
be
pro
tanto
resolved
and
not
on
policy
grounds
but
on
constitutional
grounds.
now,
we
say
that
under
the
doctrine
of
in
re
ross,
well
settled
in
our
history
and
in
the
history
of
international
law,
congress
is
free
to
make
this
choice
and
can
provide
for
the
exercise
of
this
american
jurisdiction
wherein
particular
cases,
it
is
obtained
from
foreign
countries.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
would
--
i
would
say
this,
your
honor.
that
first
of
all,
if
we
had
had
an
agreement
with
korea
which
provided
for
the
exercise
of
american
jurisdiction
there,
apart
from
military
jurisdiction
which
terminated
over
toth
that
under
in
re
ross,
it
seems
clear
we
could
exercise
such
jurisdiction
in
the
foreign
country.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
your
honor,
the
--
i
think
that
that
poses
constitutional
questions
arising
from
legislation
congress
has
never
attempted
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
and
you
have
to
go
back
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
it
doesn't
because
where
article
2
(11)
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
i
understand.
in
--
in
the
toth's
case,
toth
had
come
back
to
the
united
states.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor,
it
does
make
a
difference.
i
think
if
ross
had
been
permitted
freely
to
come
back
to
the
united
states
without
being
tried,
you
would
have
a
very
serious
question
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
whether
he
could
be
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
--
i
think
that
where
you
catch
him
or
when
you
catch
him
makes
the
difference
as
it
did
in
toth.
if
we
had
caught
him
a
day
before
his
discharge,
then
there
would
have
been
no
question.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
well,
there
--
there
the
point
was
that
the
jurisdiction
constitutionally
could
subsist
only
so
long
as
that
certain
status
remain.
and
when
it
terminated,
it
could
not
be
recaptured.
now,
i
think
--
or
maybe
we
--
we
argued
toth
erroneously
and
i
realized
you're
not
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
you're
not
--
you're
not
troubled
about
that.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
but
in
toth,
we
felt
that
we
had
to
show
that
this
continuing
jurisdiction
--
this
provision
for
continuing
jurisdiction
was
felt.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
as
part
of
the
scheme
of
military
justice.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
as
to
that,
your
honor,
the
--
the
basis
for
--
the
occasion
for
this
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
has
changed,
true.
now,
we
deal
with
equal
sovereigns
upon
we
--
whom
we
do
not
impose
our
will
but
who
instead
recognize
all
these
civilized
countries
the
important
need
we
have
for
the
exercise
of
this
american
jurisdiction
in
their
country.
but
i
cannot
see
how
it
could
possibly
make
a
constitutional
difference
whether
we
get
this
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
in
this
relatively
dignified
and
happy
way,
though
the
occasion
for
it
may
not
be
happy
or
whether
we
thrust
it
down
the
throat
of
a
foreign
nation,
it
can't
make
a
constitutional
difference
as
to
the
nature
of
the
power
of
congress
to
implement
that
jurisdiction
without
attempting
the
impossible,
without
attempting
to
set
up
article
3
tribunals
and
to
create
in
the
60
countries
across
the
world
a
grand
jury
and
petit
jury
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
for
the
trial
of
offenses.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
turn
to
the
point
about
the
military
need
which
i
--
i
think
must
be
troubling
you.
but
before
i
get
to
that
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
military
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
but
--
but
before
i
go
to
the
--
the
justifications
for
this
statute
in
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14
in
the
war
power,
i
want
to
meet
what
i
perceive
to
be
an
implicit
problem
in
what
your
honor
has
said.
i
want
to
say
first
that
when
general
crowder
in
1916
proposed
article
2
(d),
the
precursor
of
article
2
(11),
he
made
clear
the
international
situation
to
which
it
refers.
i
want
to
say
second
that
we
don't
think
congress
needs
to
write
a
brief
or
invoke
specifically
the
particular
constitutional
powers
which
justified
its
action
when
it
passes
the
statute.
so,
i
say
congress
was
aware
of
the
international
implications
of
this
statute
and
i
say
further
even
if
it
had
not
been,
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
for
us
to
sustain
the
statute
on
this
basis.
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
have
come
about
to
the
end
of
point
one
of
my
two
points.
and
that
point
is
that
for
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
in
a
foreign
country,
for
an
offense
committed
in
that
foreign
country
where
the
foreign
country
would
normally
have
jurisdiction
but
where
it
has
waived
or
otherwise
recognized
our
right
to
exercise
such
jurisdiction.
in
such
cases,
under
in
re
ross,
congress
need
not
provide
for
an
article
3
tribunal
or
for
indictment
or
jury
trial
but
may
provide
for
legislative
courts,
consular
courts
in
the
ross
case.
here,
an
established
system
of
military
courts
as
to
which
we
think
no
constitutional
distinction
can
be
made.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that
--
the
ross
case
--
the
ross
argument
shows
the
breadth
of
this
power
to
confer
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
on
american
officers.
it
is
not
peculiarly
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
a
military
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
they
would
not
have
to
be
military
officers
or
civilian
officers.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
or
non-official
--
or
non-official.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
how
you
confer
a
foreign
or
local
judicial
power
on
a
non-official,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
--
i
mean
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
by
the
conferring
of
that
power,
he
would
be
an
official
and
i
hope
an
adequate
one
but
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
it
goes
that
far,
your
honor.
after
all,
ross
didn't
work
for
the
consul
or
have
anything
else
to
do
with
them.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
i
think
it's
a
very
powerful
argument
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
think
he
--
he
must
ipso
facto
by
the
conferring
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
of
that
power
be
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
by
the
very
fact
that
--
that
congress
has
given
him
that
power,
that's
his
official
power
and
he
is
thereby
an
official.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
--
i
don't
come
down
to
the
minimum
problems
of
due
process,
although
ross
spoke
sweepingly,
i
don't
think
you'd
use
tortured
confessions
or
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
--
we
certainly
assume
that
and
i
think
we
ought
to
assume
it
here.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
in
the
ross
case,
under
--
under
extremely
--
they
--
law
under
the
statutes
to
the
united
states
where
they
might
apply
if
they
were
conformable
to
the
treaty
or
if
they
didn't
work
under
the
common
law
or
if
that
didn't
work
on
the
decrees
or
regulations
administered.as
for
procedure,
mostly,
whatever
the
minister
prescribed.
now,
in
our
case
under
a
code
of
military
justice
which
congress
has
carefully
safeguarded
because
three
million
or
more
american
men
and
women
are
certainly
subject
to
it
under
a
code
which
i
think
--
which
this
court
has
said
affords
the
basic
due
process
guarantees
in
both
substantively
and
procedurally
presents
an
admirable
system
of
justice.
now,
i
turn
to
my
second
point
which
is
that
here,
unlike
the
provision
involved
in
toth,
congress
acted
within
its
power
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces
within
the
war
power,
within
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
that
this
sustain
this
enactment.
now,
in
toth,
this
court
pointed
out
as
we
had
said
in
our
brief
that
article
3
(a),
when
it
was
introduced
in
1950,
was
opposed
by
the
judge
advocate
general.
this
court
in
that
same
thing
said,
“army
discipline
will
not
be
improved
by
court-martialing
rather
than
trying
by
jury
some
civilian
ex-soldier
who's
been
wholly
separated
from
the
service
for
months,
years
or
perhaps
decades."
and
the
court
said
that
toth
had
several
relationships
with
the
military
so
that,
at
the
time
of
arrest,
he
held
no
relationship
of
any
kind
with
the
military.
compared
with
that,
article
of
war
2
(d)
was
actively
sought
by
the
judge
advocate
general
40
years
ago.
it
has
been
enforced
and
supported
by
successive
judge
advocates
general
ever
since.
it
pertains,
we
believe,
to
persons
who
in
the
language
of
this
court
in
duncan
against
the
kahanamoku
are
directly
connected
with
the
armed
forces
and
as
to
whom
there
is,
again
in
the
language
of
that
case,
a
well
established
power
to
confer
a
court-martial
jurisdiction.
now,
our
very
first
articles
of
war,
preceding
the
establishment
of
our
constitution
and
continuing
thereafter,
provided
for
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
all
settlers
and
retainers
and
all
persons
whatsoever
serving
with
the
army
in
the
field.
as
mr.
wiener
has
--
colonel
wiener
has
emphasized
in
his
brief
and
i'm
sure
he
will
emphasize
again,
these
early
articles
and
their
successors
were
construed
and
applied
until
1916
to
apply
only
in
war
time
and
only
"in
the
field."
and
i
might
add
in
that
connection
that
under
the
decisions
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
in
duncan
as
showing
a
well-established
power
in
the
field
included
places
within
the
united
states.
so,
for
example,
it
included
in
the
falls
case
which
this
court
cited,
a
court-martial
in
new
jersey
during
world
war
i,
in
the
jochen
case,
if
that's
how
it's
pronounced,
a
court-martial
in
texas
during
world
war
i
and
in
hines
against
mikell,
a
court-martial
in
south
carolina.
in
all
of
these
places,
the
courts
were
open
and
peacefully
functioning.
the
civilians
who
were
tried
by
these
courts-martial
would
normally
have
been
entitled,
of
course,
to
a
trial
in
an
article
3
court
or
a
state
court
with
indictment
and
it's
your
--
under
article
2
(11)
and
former
article
2
(d)
on
the
other
hand,
these
people
are
overseas,
where
a
foreign
country
would
have
jurisdiction
and
where
as
i
have
noted
this
article
3
right,
the
jury
trial
right
do
not
exist.
now,
our
opponents
concede
the
correctness,
as
duncan
and
kahanamoku
indicate
they
should,
of
these
world
war
i
cases.
they
say,
however,
that
they
have
no
bearing
here
because
this
represented
exercise
of
the
war
power
and
they
say
moreover
that
the
ladies
in
this
case
--
these
cases
who
murdered
their
husbands,
unlike
the
civilian
employees
in
those
cases,
cannot
be
regarded
as
included
within
the
power
of
provided
by
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
government
of
the
land
and
naval
--
"to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
land
and
naval
forces,"
because
these
women
cannot
be
regarded
as
being
in
or
a
part
of
the
land
and
naval
forces.
now,
in
this
connection
it's
important
to
know,
first,
article
1,
section
8,
clause
14,
as
colonel
wiener
points
out
in
providing
for
rules
and
regulations
governing
the
armed
forces,
makes
no
mention
of
war
or
peace.
second,
we
agree
with
colonel
wiener
that
it's
appropriate
and
proper
to
look
to
the
war
power
to
explain
this
long
history
of
court-martial
power
over
civilian.
and
finally,
we
say
that
even
though
in
the
much
different
situation
before
this
century,
congress
limited
such
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
war
in
the
field.
the
war
power
which
need
not
await
the
dropping
of
bombs
is
equally
relevant
and
may
properly
be
invoked
in
the
circumstances
of
our
times
to
support
article
2
(11)
and
its
predecessor
article
2
(d).
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
within
the
united
states?
no,
sir.
well,
they
could
not
as
a
matter
of
statute
and
then
i
think
we
have
a
much
harder
question,
although
i
should
be
careful
how
i
refer
to
harder
and
easier
questions
after
toth.
in
that
situation,
congress
had
not
attempted
to
provide
for
it.
it
provided
only
that
civilians
accompanying
the
armed
forces
outside
the
united
states
should
be
subject
to
military
jurisdiction
in
peace
talk.
and
that
in
time
of
war,
civilians
serving
with
or
employed
by
the
armed
forces
should
be
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
in
the
field
which
has
in
the
past
presented
some
problems,
but
as
i
say,
has
included
in
war
time
places
in
the
united
states
with
the
civilian
courts
open
and
peacefully
functioning.
today,
as
we
point
out
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
no,
it
--
it
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
--
the
war
time
provision
is
article
2
(10)
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
and
it
says
after
--
the
introduction
of
the
article
says
the
following
prisoners
shall
be
subject
to
this
code,
2
(10)
says
in
time
of
war
all
persons
serving
with
or
accompanying
an
armed
force
in
the
field
and
2
(11)
which
we
are
concerned
with
refers
to
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
--
i
would
rather
say,
your
honor,
not
that
i
make
a
distinction
but
that
just
as
our
opponent
reads
the
powers
together
in
sustaining
these
world
war
i
cases
and
prior
cases
of
court-martial
jurisdiction
over
civilians
in
war
time,
so
we
think
the
powers
must
be
read
together
in
seeing,
in
--
in
determining
the
validity
of
this
different
jurisdiction
in
foreign
countries
in
the
circumstances
of
our
times.
now,
today,
we
have
250,000
dependents
living
overseas
with
our
military
establishments
in
foreign
countries
and
some
20,000
civilian
employees.
this
compares
with
just
over
a
million
men
in
uniform
overseas.
in
other
words,
roughly
a
quarter
of
our
military
establishments
overseas
consist
of
civilians.
as
i
say,
they
live
in
close-knit
military
communities,
where
the
offenses
of
any
individual,
in
or
out
of
uniform,
may
affect
the
morale,
the
safety,
the
effectiveness
of
the
establishment
or
its
acceptability
to
the
foreign
country.
now,
our
allies
receiving
these
military
establishments
with
their
civilians
received
as
unitary
whole
general
agreements
and
provisions
applying
to
all
these
people
together.
our
allies
expect
that
these
people
will
be
controlled
to
prevent
injury
or
offense
to
the
foreign
country
receiving.
from
our
own
point
of
view,
the
military
authorities
having
control
of
these
military
establishments
and
responsible
both
for
the
effectiveness
of
their
mission
and
for
maintaining
satisfactory
relations
with
our
allies,
which
is
part
of
the
same
thing,
need
control
over
these
people
living
so
intimately
with
the
forces.
as
to
our
allies,
black
marketeering,
customs
violations
and
other
economic
or
political
offenses
whether
by
a
person
in
uniform
or
out,
identified
with
these
military
communities
will
cause
the
kind
of
friction
that
our
military
mission
requires
us
to
prevent.
on
the
military
establishment,
drunk
and
driving,
assault,
larceny,
dope
peddling
and
all
manner
of
other
offenses
including
killing
members
of
the
military
establishment
are
just
as
much
concerns
of
the
military
authorities
whether
they're
committed
by
persons
in
or
out
of
uniform.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
want
to
say
that
this
is
a
problem
not
merely
of
250,000
civilians
but
of
--
and
we
showed
this
in
our
reply
brief,
of
some
400
cases
arising
yearly
on
an
average
between
the
six-year
period
we
have
figures
for
involving
trials
by
civilians
accompanying
or
serving
with
the
armed
forces
overseas.
now,
these
military
communities
overseas
are,
in
fact,
american
military
governmental
enclaves
allowed
to
be
established
in
a
foreign
country.
they
have
schools,
they
hospitals,
they
provide
recreation
and
welfare
facilities,
fire
and
police
facilities.
they
are
responsible
in
all
manners
of
ways
for
the
safety,
the
welfare
and
the
behavior
of
all
these
civilians.
to
accomplish
this
effectively
and
to
accomplish
their
military
mission
effectively,
they
need
control
on-the-spot
disciplinary
authority
over
these
people.
the
alternative
that
colonel
wiener
suggests
of
sending
these
people
back
to
the
united
states
for
trial
in
our
district
courts
is
probably
impracticable
and
is,
in
any
event,
not
required
of
congress
under
the
constitution
as
to
its
impracticability.
the
court
knows
and
we've
pointed
it
out
in
the
briefs
that
these
sessions
of
jurisdiction
by
the
foreign
countries
are
made
with
reluctance
when
they
made
it
all.
as
anthony
even
said
in
his
note
connected
with
the
agreement
in
this
case
and
as
everyone
knows,
it
represented
a
considerable
departure
from
traditional
british
practice.
now,
the
concession
is
made
because
as
our
allies
have
recognized
expressly
in
some
places
and
as
everybody
knows
they
would,
first,
without
listing
these
in
order
of
importance
because
we
want
it,
congress
has
thought
that
in
many
instances
where
it
could
be
obtained,
an
american
trial
by
a
military
tribunal
was
to
be
preferred
to
a
trial
by
a
foreign
court
in
any
one
of
a
number
of
countries.
and
i
preach
no
narrow
chauvinism
here
and
i
do
not
claim
as
colonel
wiener
charges
that
we
believe
a
foreign
trial
is,
to
quote
his
language,
"the
ultimate
horrible."
it
may
and
this
is
debatable
in
a
particular
country
be
as
good
as
or
somebody
might
think
better
than
an
american
trial
in
a
military
court-martial.
certainly,
it
maybe
and
many
people
so
believe
worst
than
a
trial
in
an
american
court-martial.
foreign
language,
foreign
procedures,
foreign
counsel
are
certainly
important
difficulties
for
a
defendant
to
face
but
the
question
of
the
better
and
the
worst,
we
say,
could
properly
be
resolved
by
congress
as
it
is
being
resolved
by
both
congress
and
the
executive
in
the
continuing
pattern
of
agreements
we
make
with
the
scores
of
foreign
countries
where
this
problem
arises.
now,
we
want
it.
the
foreign
countries
make
this
waiver
to
our
military
authorities
to
have
the
military
jurisdiction
exercised
within
their
boarders.
that
would
make
sense
to
them
and
they
have
said
that,
“we
recognize
that
you,
american
military
authorities
have
a
primary
responsibility
for
the
discipline
and
behavior
of
all
the
people
in
your
military
community.”
and
so,
they
make
the
waivers
of
varying
degrees
and
different
cases
for
authority
to
be
exercised
on
the
scene.
query
whether
any
of
these
countries
would
make
a
similar
waiver
for
these
people
in
the
400
or
so
cases
a
year
that
arise
to
be
brought
back
to
the
united
states
for
trial
in
the
federal
district
court.
now,
the
fact
is
that
any
such
concession
is
certainly
unprecedented
and
the
facts
and
the
realties
of
international
law
are
largely
a
matter
of
what
nations
have
done
and
what
they
can
be
persuaded
to
do.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
that
400
figure,
your
honor,
is
for
the
fiscal
years
1949
through
1955,
the
total
of
army
courts-martial
of
civilians
overseas
during
that
period.
i
have
--
i
do
not
have
it
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
in
all
the
countries,
yes.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
400
or
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
pardon?
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
people
perhaps
and
this
may
well
be
true
deterred
by
the
discipline
on
the
scene
generally
behave
themselves.
now
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
the
white
light
is
on,
your
honor
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
and
i
feel
obliged
to
make
large
rather
than
--
than
little
jumps.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
yes,
your
honor,
they
included
both.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
don't
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
i
don't
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
for
those
are
--
for
those
are
figures
where
we've
gotten
waivers
of
--
of
foreign
jurisdiction.
well,
we
have
a
number
of
figures
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
the
--
the
waiver
figures
we
give,
and
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
honors
question,
are
for
nato
countries
and
in
a
footnote
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
--
in
a
footnote
we
give
the
figures
for
japan.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
think
they
--
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
well,
i
think
they
represent
on
the
trial
figures
perhaps
one
trial
by
court-martial
for
every
seven
or
so
hundred
civilians
overseas.
i
don't
know
how
that
compares
with
civilian
justice
in
the
united
states.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
we
--
we
make
no
such
argument,
your
honor.
we
do
say
--
[laughter]
that
congress
acted
well
within
its
powers
in
making
the
position
it
did
that
we
probably
would
not
get
more
from
foreign
countries
that
the
result
is
striking
down
article
2
(11)
at
least
for
the
foreseeable
future
would
mean
that
american
jurisdiction
we
are
now
able
to
exercise
in
foreign
countries,
we
would
not
be
able
to
exercise.
and
we
say
that
congress
need
not
be
compelled
to
attempt
the
district
court
in
the
united
states
alternative.
that
same
argument
could
have
made
--
been
made
in
in
re
ross.
it
could
certainly
have
been
made
in
madsen
against
kinsella
where
an
american
wife
accompanying
her
husband
true
and
occupied
germany
and
my
time
doesn't
permit
my
showing
except
to
say
it
quickly
that
that
does
not,
in
our
view,
make
a
constitutional
difference.
thereto
you
could
have
said,
“well,
congress
must
provide
a
trial
in
the
federal
district
court
and
not
without
indictment
and
jury
over
in
germany.”
and
it
would
have
been
easy
because
germany
was
subject
to
our
plenary
control.
congress
didn't
do
it
and
we
claim
congress
is
not
required
under
the
constitution
to
do
it
when
it
provides
the
kind
of
american
trial
it
has
for
these
people
in
these
foreign
countries.
mr.
marvin
e.
frankel
if
the
court
please.
at
the
risk
of
this
character
--
in
carrying
your
displeasure
i
would
like
to
use
my
two
minutes.colonel
wiener
and
i
understand
the
ross
case
entirely
differently
from
each
other.
as
i
read
the
case
it
does
not
hold
that
the
treaty
with
japan
created
american
constitutional
power
to
create
consular
courts,
that's
not
what
the
court
said.
the
court
said
that
congress
had
power
to
create
such
courts
to
exercise
such
foreign
jurisdiction
when
we
could
get
it.
and
colonel
wiener
has
misunderstood
what
we're
saying
whether
it's
right
or
wrong
when
he
accuses
us
of
saying
that
a
british
statute
or
treaty
adds
to
american
constitutional
power.
as
in
ross,
we
say,
congress
had
power
to
provide
for
these
tribunals
just
like
consular
tribunals
to
exercise
this
foreign
jurisdiction
in
a
foreign
country
when
the
foreign
country
would
recognize
our
right
to
it
and
that's
what's
been
done.
and
we
think
that
colonel
wiener's
concession
today
that
congress
could
create
consular
courts
to
try
these
americans
overseas,
consular
courts
by
the
vague
standards
that
you
can
read
in
title
22,
we
think
that
that
concession,
if
we
understand
the
principles
correctly,
concedes
his
case
because
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
officers
who
seat
in
courts-martial,
the
fact
that
they
wear
uniform
and
the
fact
that
they
administer
a
detailed
code
safeguarded
for
three
million
americans
does
not
make
their
jurisdiction
constitutionally
less
permissible
than
that
of
the
ad
hoc
consular
courts.
