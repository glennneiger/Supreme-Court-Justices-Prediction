mr.
frankel,
would
you
mind
stating
to
us
what
relationship
this
particular
jail
as
to
the
present
system
--
federal
present
system
and
if
there
is
any
difference
in
responsibility
or
the
way
they
take
their
prisoners
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
that
point.
may
--
may
the
--
this
jail
refuse
to
take
any
--
any
prisoners
as
in
the
case
of
states
and
--
and
cities
and

or
--
or
have
they
the
right
to
--
to
send
them
to
this
prison
in
any
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
must
take
them.

chief

that
apply
in
times
of
peace
as
well
as
war
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
your
position
then
that
--
that
it
applies
equally
in
time
of
peace
to
time
of
war?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
question.
do
you
--
it
is
your
position
then
not
to
--
to
insist
upon
a
jury
trial
of
these
women
in
these
cases
would
be
to
extend
the
function
of
the
jury
rather
than
to
--
to
restrict
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
wives
--
the
wives
and
other
dependents
of
military
personnel,
who
live
on
a
cantonment
in
this
country,
are
they
camp
followers
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
a
sense
that
that
--
you
say
that
book
describes
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
could
congress
say
that
the
dependents
of
military
personnel
in
this
country
who
live
on
a
cantonment
are
in
the
military
service
and
would
be
subject
to
court-martial
as
these
women
are?
chief
justice
earl
warren
power
is
concerned,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i'm
talking
about
power.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
going
to
ask
this.
do
--
do
any
of
your
briefs
point
out
the
--
the
difference
between
the
disciplinary
necessities
that
are
involved
between
dependents
who
were
living
on
a
cantonment
in
this
country
and,
let's
say,
outside
of
washington
and
--
on
the
one
hand,
and
--
and
the
dependents
living
outside
of
london
on
the
other
hand?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
developed
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
book
develop
the
thesis
that
they
are
subject
to
military
discipline?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
you
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
rations
were
issued
uncooked
and
that
the
women
--
women
cooked
them.
does
the
book
indicate
that
they
had
any
right
to
compel
any
service
from
these
women
in
connection
with
the
--
either
the
cooking
or
any
other
services
in
connection
with
the
army?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
obligated
to
take
care
of
the
men?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
--
do
you
mean
by
that
that
these
people
have
been
tried
in
something
other
than
a
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
an
officer
of
the
army
committed
treason
in
the
field,
would
he
be
tried
by
a
civil
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
you
have
--
wouldn't
your
answer
be
the
same
then
about
these
women
if
they
had
--
had
committed
treason
if
they
were
--
if
they
were
to
be
subjected
to
court-martial
generally
under
the
war
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
said
that's
the
only
answer
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
thought
you
said
that
somebody
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
say
that's
the
only
answer
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
bearing
on
the
--
on
the
impossibility
of
following
the
procedure
of
bringing
them
back
and
trying
them
here,
you're
going
to
try
one
of
these
women
here,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
--
you
can
do
that
with
her,
why
can't
it
be
done
with
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
wasn't
the
circumstances
that
caused
you
to
--
to
try
her
over
here.
it
was
the
fact
that
--
that
our
case
was
reversed
and
you're
--
you're
up
against
trying
her
here,
isn't
that
right?
now,
you
can
try
her
here
and
you
think
--
you
think
this
can
be
done
satisfactorily.
chief
justice
earl
warren
haven't
we
been
that
way
in
our
state
courts
for
ever
since
beginning
of
time
that
you
couldn't
bring
a
witness
from
another
state
until
recently
to
--
to
testify?
all
he
had
to
do
is
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
state
line
and
government
couldn't
use
him
--
couldn't
use
him
but
we
tried
cases
just
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they're
difficulties
--
they're
difficulties,
i
agree,
but
does
that
warn
us
in
saying
that
it's
impossible
to
do
it
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
generally,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
could
take
depositions,
couldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
as
you
were
talking
about
the
defense
as
i
understood
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
of
any
case.
we
haven't
found
any.
we
found
these
cases
prior
to
the
revolutionary
period,
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
bearing
on
the
size
of
this
problem,
have
you
--
have
you
tried
to
find
out
how
many
cases,
serious
cases
of
defendants
have
come
to
the
attention
on
the
authority
and
have
been
handled
by
court-martial
under
this
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
--
could
you
give
us
a
memorandum
on
how
many
cases
there
are
of
that
kind
of
serious
or
--
and
moderately
serious
cases
that
have
been
tried
by
court-martial.
i'm
speaking
now
only
of
dependents,
not
--
not
to
civilian
employees.
can
you
do
that
for
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
--
would
you
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
broken
down
between
employees
and
dependents?
they
--
i
understood
they
were
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
different.
i'm
talking
about
dependents
as
a
problem.
i
--
i
think
its
one
thing,
isn't
it
to
--
perhaps
as
to
whether
civilian
employees
of
the
army
are
subject
to
court-martial
and
because
they're
connected
with
the
service,
quite
another
thing
for
dependents
who
have
no
connection
with
the
service.
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
you
don't
make
the
distinction
but
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
my
mind,
there
is
some
distinction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
general,
i
--
i
thought
just
--
just
recently,
i
read
in
the
paper
where
we
had
given
up
our
right
to
--
to
try
our
people
in
this
situation
in
morocco.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
my
--
my
recollection
is
that
after
that
consular
court
or
whatever
you
might
call
it
had
been
abolished
by
congress,
we
entered
into
a
--
a
treaty
to
--
to
permit
morocco
to
try
our
people
over
there.
and
the
way
i
read
it,
was
in
connection
with
the
philippines
situation.
the
filipinos
were
complaining
that
we
--
we
permitted
japan
by
treaty
to
try
our
citizens.
we
--
we
permitted
morocco
by
treaty
to
do
it,
but
we
haven't
yet
done
it
so
far
as
the
philippines
were
concerned
and
they
were
complaining.
now,
i
may
have
misread
the
--
the
news
dispatchers
but
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
supposed
this
--
this
woman
who
was
convicted
in
england
by
court-martial,
had
not
lived
on
the
cantonments,
suppose
she
had
lived
in
a
downtown
apartment
in
--
in
london
and
had
not
taken
advantage
of
the
--
of
the
post
exchanged
rights
and
the
hospital
rights
and
--
and
the
other
things
that
the
right
to
get
rent
at
the
cantonment.
suppose
she
chose
to
live
in
an
apartment
down
in
the
center
of
london,
would
she
still
have
been
subjected
to
court-martial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
yes,
she's
a
--
she's
a
wife
of
an
army
also.
let
us
say
the
same
circumstance
you've
got
here
except
that
she
happens
to
be
living
in
an
apartment
downtown
by
choice
rather
than
to
live
in
the
army
camp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
was
no
requirement
when
she
went
over
there
that
she
was
obliged
to
live
on
the
enclave.
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
benefit
to
her.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
of
course,
they
would
have
the
--
she'd
have
very
much
the
same
benefits
if
her
husband
was
stationed
in
this
country
and
she
lived
on
the
enclave.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i'm
finished.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
pardon
me,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
while
we're
dealing
with
dependents,
suppose
this
was
a
child,
clearly
a
juvenile,
he
committed
the
--
a
serious
crime
over
in
england,
would
you
try
the
child
before
a
court-martial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
could
--
it
could
if
he
was
--
if
he
was
to
be
treated
as
a
criminal.
it's
only
whether
--
as
i
understand
it,
it's
only
where
the
state
waives
his
right
to
treat
the
--
the
juvenile
as
a
criminal,
and
treats
him
as
a
ward
of
the
--
of
the
court
that
it
can
discipline
him,
but
it
cannot.
they
could
both
consider
him
as
a
--
try
him
as
a
criminal,
and
do
it
other
than
by
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
colonel
wiener.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
not
without
regard
whether
on
united
states
enclave
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
