mr.
rutledge
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
by
way
of
certiorari
to
review
a
final
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
denying
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
petition
was
filed
and
denied
without
a
hearing
and
without
requiring
any
response
thereto.
the
petition
claimed
a
denial
of
federal
rights
and
it
claimed
that
the
petitioner
was
imprisoned
and
had
been
convicted
in
violation
of
rights
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
two
basic
grounds
were
asserted
in
support
of
that
claim.
one
of
those
was
a
claim
that
petitioner
had
been
punished
three
times
for
a
single
offense.
and,
moreover,
that
he'd
been
twice
so
punished.
in
short,
that
he
had
been
punished
six
times
for
two
offenses.
the
other
ground,
in
support
of
that
claim,
was
a
contention
that
petitioner
had
been
convicted
solely
and
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
perjured
testimony
of
two
codefendants,
former
employees
of
his
who
had
been
tried
together
with
him.
petitioner
did
not
make
any
allegation
with
this
use
of
perjured
testimony
was
known
to
the
state.
no
such
allegation
appears
in
this
case.
his
contention
was
simply
that
where
he
could
make
a
showing
such
as
he
did
in
this
case,
a
prima
facie
showing
as
strong
as
he
could
in
this
case,
that
the
obligation
was
imposed
upon
the
state
under
the
due
process
clause
to
afford
him
some
remedy
to
rectify
such
a
grievous
wrong.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
the
--
the
petitioner,
of
course,
realizes
that
the
due
process
clause
applies
only
to
state
action.
but
it's
petitioner's
contention
that
the
continued
imprisonment
of
petitioner
after
such
a
strong
prima
facie
showing
as
was
made
in
this
case
constitutes
state
action.
the
state
is
keeping
this
man
in
prison,
is
depriving
him
of
his
liberty.
and
it
continues
to
do
so
after
he
has
shown
that
two
--
the
two
witnesses
who
supplied
the
only,
the
exclusive
evidence
in
support
of
his
conviction
within
six
months
after
the
trial
admitted.
one
under
oath
and
the
other
one
admitted
it
to
a
fellow
prisoner
that
they
had
framed
him.
that
they
had
deliberately
decided
before
they
went
into
their
illegal
enterprise
that
if
they
were
caught,
that
they
would
implicate
falsely
their
employer
because
he
had
a
good
reputation
in
the
community,
he'd
never
been
in
trouble
before
and
they
thought
that
so
doing,
they
would
take
the
owners
of
themselves.
as
it
so
happens,
both
of
them
did
receive
lighter
sentences
than
the
petitioner.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
due
process
requires
that
a
state
afford
some
remedy
in
that
situation
where
a
man
who
makes
as
strong
a
prima
facie
showing
as
this
man
did
where
he
shows
that
the
exclusive,
the
only
evidence
used
to
convict
him
was
perjured
testimony.
there
was
no
other
evidence
according
to
the
allegations
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
case.
mr.
rutledge
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
we
don't
necessarily
contend
that
a
new
trial
would
have
to
be
gone
in
two
weeks.
we
--
we
submit
that
the
state
should
afford
some
remedy,
some
--
even
if
that
the
--
the
state
required
him
to
show
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
same
burden
that
was
imposed
on
the
state
to
convict
him
in
the
first
place.
that
his
conviction
was
based
solely
and
exclusively
on
perjured
testimony.
then
we
submit
that
if
--
if
he
could
make
such
a
showing
beyond
unreasonable
doubt,
well
then
the
state
should
--
should
grant
a
new
trial
or
should
discharge
him.
mr.
rutledge
that's
right,
your
honor.
except
this
fact,
and
that
is
that
within
six
months
after
the
conviction,
these
two
codefendants
came
in
and
admitted
that
they
had
framed
him.
one
of
them
said,
“may
i
stand
before
my
god
and
say
that
dan
durley
is
innocent
of
the
charges
that
i
--that
i
made
with
against
him.”
and
the
--
the
man,
as
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
petition
here,
the
crime
charge
was
stealing
cattle.
and
his
two
codefendants
took
the
stand
and
admitted
according
to
the
allegations
of
the
petition
that
they
were
guilty
of
that
offense.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
denied
his
guilt.
and
the
only
evidence
against
him
was
the
testimony
of
these
two
defendants
that
he
was
there
and
that
he
was
a
party
to
the
crime
or
that
he
--
that
he
was
a
--
a
member
of
the
group.
that
he
had
conspired
in
any
--
any
event
to
--
with
them
to
perform
this
offense.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
i
would
certainly
concede
that
if
these
were
a
case
where
there
was
other
evidence,
where
say,
he
was
captured
at
--
at
the
scene,
at
the
(inaudible)
precisely
that
then
perhaps
the
mere
recantation
of
testimony
by
one
of
the
witnesses
would
not
be
--
would
not
raise
a
federal
question.
but
where,
as
the
allegation
is
here,
the
sole
and
exclusive
testimony
that
is
used
to
convict
is
perjured
testimony
and
his
admitted
perjured
testimony
where
the
perjurers
come
in
and
can
--
and
confess
their
perjury
that
there
should
be,
under
due
process
of
law,
some
remedy
for
a
man
in
that
situation.
mr.
rutledge
sir?
mr.
rutledge
don't
have
any
case
that
goes
that
far,
your
honor.
no
case,
whatsoever.
mr.
rutledge
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
rutledge
my
counsel
on
the
other
side
would
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i'm
sure,
but
it's
my
understanding
there
is
no
definite
set
time
upon
it.
i
might
say
that
according
to
the
allegations
in
the
petition
or
in
one
of
the
supporting
affidavits
to
this
petition
in
this
case,
shows
that
petitioner
had
applied
for
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
previously.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
in
exhibit
--
he
so
states
in
the
petition
--
mr.
rutledge
it's
not
in
this
record
here,
your
honor,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
know
that
he
applied
to
the
supreme
court
for
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
and
they
told
him
he'd
applied
to
the
wrong
court.
he
then
went
down
to
the
circuit
court
of
record
and
applied
and
they
denied
him
relief
and
he
then
appealed
and
his
appeal
was
dismissed.
i
believe
that
counsel
would
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i'm
--
but
i'm
--
that
is
my
understanding
of
this
prior
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
proceedings
in
this
case.
mr.
rutledge
it's
my
understanding
that
they
do.
and
i
suppose
in
this
case
if
there
was
any
corroboration
it
might
have
been
in
the
fact,
and
i
can
only
infer
this,
from
the
meager
record
in
this
case
that
there
was
truck
involved
in
this
stealing
of
cattle.
and
that
truck
did
belong
to
the
petitioner.
if
petitioner
submits
that
it
is
federal
law
in
this
court
that
where
a
petition
is
denied
without
a
hearing
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
petition
must
be
taken
as
truth.
and
in
support
of
that,
in
support
of
this
first
ground,
the
ground
concerning
double
punishment,
the
facts
that
he
alleges
in
his
petition
were
as
follows.
he
alleges
that
he
was
charged
with
the
crime
of
stealing
a
cattle,
submitted
on
july
7,
1945.
and
he
was
charged
for
stealing
five
cows.
actually,
i
believe
it
was
two
steers,
and
two
cows
and
one
heifer,
all
belonging
to
one
owner
on
that
day.
the
charge,
however,
was
contained
in
one
information
and
it
contained
three
counts.
they
divided
the
cows
up.
they
charged
him
with
one
offense
of
stealing
two
steers
and
another
offense
for
stealing
the
two
cows
and
the
third
offense
for
stealing
the
one
heifer.
petitioner
contends
that
the
evidence
of
the
state,
the
only
evidence
of
the
state
show
that
all
five
of
those
cows
were
taken
at
the
same
time,
under
the
same
circumstances,
with
the
same
intent
in
all
as
one
transaction.
and
petitioner
has
--
has
shown
and
cited
in
his
case,
in
his
brief,
a
florida
case
clearly
stating
that
under
such
circumstances,
there
is
only
one
offense
committed.
the
same
as
whether
you
steal
$10
or
$20,
whether
you
steal
five
cows
or
one
cow,
it's
just
one
offense
if
you
do
it
at
one
time,
at
the
same
place
under
the
same
circumstances.
mr.
rutledge
apparently
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
there
--
whether
there
were
two
trips
necessary.
there's
--
there's
no
showing
according
to
allegations
in
the
--
in
the
petition.
the
cattle
were
--
were
shot
according
to
testimony
of
the
state,
shot,
slaughtered
and
butchered
and
put
on
the
truck
and
take
it
to
market
all
at
one
time.
that
all
this
one
transaction.
mr.
rutledge
none
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
none
--
none
that
i
know
of
at
all.
mr.
rutledge
as
i
understand
the
state's
position
in
this
proceeding,
i
suppose
they
--
they
will
deny
it.
they
haven't
denied
it
against
because
they
have
filed
no
response
to
the
petition.
mr.
rutledge
there
--
your
honor,
there
is
no
record
in
the
case.
there's
no
appeal,
was
taken
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
as
i
understand,
it
may
be
possible
to
obtain
a
record
but
i
have
not
seen
it.
i
doubt
very
much
that
one
would
ever
print
to
type
it
up.
but
there
may
be,
possible
to
obtain
some
typewritten
notes,
but
there
is
--
there
is
no
record
in
the
supreme
court
or
there
was
no
record
attached
to
--
to
this
petition
in
anyway.
and
the
state
has
--
has
not
shown
that
there
was
a
record.
now,
i
don't
believe
there
is
one.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
i
understand
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel
at
the
trial
of
the
case.
at
the
outset
of
this
--
this
case,
we're
faced
with
a
--
with
the
jurisdictional
question
which
the
state
has
raised
concerning
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
it
is
contended
by
the
state
that
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
could
or
might
have
been
possibly
based
upon
another
adequate
state
ground.
the
state
does
not,
as
i
understand
it,
does
not
deny
that
habeas
corpus
is
the
proper
remedy
in
florida
for
a
man
in
making
such
claim
as
this.
they
do
claim,
however,
that
he
had
made
prior
applications
for
habeas
corpus
which
had
been
denied
and
that
the
denial
of
those
prior
applications
bars
his
renewal
in
this
case.
they
contend,
as
i
understand
it,
two
barrels
attached,
one,
that
the
prior
denials
are
res
judicata
of
this
case
and
the
other
one
that
his
failure
to
raise
these
questions
in
his
prior
applications,
petitions
for
habeas
corpus,
constitutes
some
sort
of
a
waiver
of
his
federal
constitutional
rights.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
those
two
beginning.
submitted
that
just
as
in
a
case
of
statutory
interpretation
that
the
--
the
first
place
to
go
is
to
the
order
of
the
court
itself
to
decide
just
what
it
did
do.
this
court
has
held
in
case
of
rice
v.olson.
that,
if
a
state
court
puts
his
judgements
squarely
on
the
lack
of
merit
in
the
petition,
this
court
will
not
speculate
about
what
other
grounds
the
state
court
might
have
resorted
to,
to
deny
the
petition.
it
submitted
that
the
order
in
this
case
shows
on
its
face
that
the
court
considered
the
merits
of
this
petition
and
denied
rule
upon
those
merits,
and
denied
it.
the
order
states
simply
it's
very
brief
order
that
upon
consideration
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
above
cause,
it
appears
that
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
as
a
condition
preceding
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
was
detained
in
custody
without
lawful
authority.
it
is
ordered
therefore
that
said
petition
be
and
same
is
hereby
denied.
it
submitted
that
the
court
there,
on
its
face,
clearly
was
simply
saying
you
failed
to
state
of
cause
of
action
in
your
petition.
even
conceding
the
truth
of
everything
that
you
say,
you
haven't
shown
a
violation
of
federal
rights.
and
that
petitioner
submits,
is
a
ruling.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
he
filed
a
handwritten,
self-drawn
petition
of
--
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
1948,
i
believe
it
was.
that
petition,
petitioner
submits
was
not
res
judicata
of
this
case
for
several
reasons.
mr.
rutledge
i
--
i
suppose
there's
--
there
the
--
the
court
--
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
they
may
have
had
constructive
knowledge
but
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
had
actual
knowledge
of
it
or
not.
the
petition
was
filed
and
no
response
was
required.
it
was
placed
on
a
motion
calendar.
petitioner
was
notified
that
it
would
be
so
placed.
he
couldn't
attend
because
he
was
incarcerated
and
he
had
no
attorney.
and
then
after,
as
i
understand
it,
i
don't
know,
perhaps,
as
i
understand
the
state
was
represented
that
--
that
this
calling
of
the
motion
calendar
and
thereafter,
the
petition
was
summarily
denied.
mr.
rutledge
no,
your
honor
i
--
i
--
mr.
rutledge
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
address
myself
to
that
point
because
except
in
this
way.
florida
is
a
common
law
and
florida
is
a
common
law
state.
it
has
adopted
the
common
law
of
england.
res
judicata
did
not
apply
to
habeas
corpus.
there
is,
as
i
understand
it,
there
were
two
actions,
habeas
corpus
and
ejectment,
the
right
of
property
and
liberty
that
were
considered
so
important
in
common
law
that
res
judicata
was
the
doctrine
that
was
barring
you
did
not
apply.
and
--
but
by
statute,
florida
came
along
and
--
and
applied
what
we
submit
is
a
modified
form
of
res
judicata
not
with
the
full
force
and
vigor
of
the
--
of
the
law
of
judgment
but
merely
parallel
to
what
the
federal
government
has
done
only
recently.
and
that
is
the
statute
which
is
cited
in
the
appendix
to
petitioner's
brief,
states
that
after
a
petitioner
has
applied
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
had
been
remanded
to
custody
that
he
shall
not
be
at
liberty
to
obtain
another
habeas
corpus
for
the
same
cause
or
by
any
other
proceeding
to
bring
the
same
matter
again
in
question,
the
same
matter.
and
we
submit
that
that
statute
being
in
derogation
of
the
common
law,
simply
applies
a
restricted,
a
--
a
truncated
version
of
res
judicata.
it
simply
says
that
you
can't
raise
the
same
--
if
you
raise
the
question
once
and
it's
gone
into,
evidence
is
taken
and
it's
decided
against
you,
well,
then
you
can't
come
in
with
another
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
raise
the
same
factual
question
all
over
again.
but
that
--
mr.
rutledge
precisely,
your
honor.
i
believe
you
could
do
that
at
common
law
even
on
--
even
as
to
ground
a
again
and
again.
and
in
florida,
i
think
that
rule
still
applies
insofar
as
there
are
different
grounds.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor
that
case.
mr.
rutledge
well,
your
honor,
we
--
we
contend
--
and
i
mean,
of
course,
if
florida
had
done
that,
that
would
be
another
question.
but
we
don't
submit
that
florida
has,
in
this
case.
and
for
our
first
evidence
to
that
is
the
order
in
this
case
itself.

decided
a
number
of
cases
where
the
florida
supreme
court
has
said
has
denied
a
petition
saying
that
you
are
barred
because
you
raised
this
point
in
the
prior
case.
everytime
it's
done
that,
it's
done
on
it
the
express
ground.
it's
--
it's
told
the
petitioner,
“here
you
raised
it
in
this
former
case.
now
you
can't
raise
it
again.”
and
indeed
in
one
case,
its
case
which
is
not
cited
in
--
in
either
brief
but
is
in
rebuttal
to
the
claim
of
the
respondent.
it's
pope
v.mayo,
39
so.2d
287.
the
court
took
pains
to
point
out
that
the
prior
case,
the
writ
was
issued,
a
response
was
made
to
the
writ.
a
hearing
was
held,
evidence
was
taken
and
that
a
complete
hearing
was
--
was
given
to
petitioner
on
this
matter
and
that,
therefore,
he
could
not
raise
it
again
in
this
case.
mr.
rutledge
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
they're
in
the
record.
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
--
in
--
mr.
rutledge
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
so.
except
with
--
well
--
well
with
this
--
this
further
statement
that
no
hearing
on
the
merits
according
to
petitioner's
contention
was
ever
held
on
either
one
of
these
prior
petitions.
mr.
rutledge
well,
we
submit
that
under
florida
law,
this
doctrine
of
res
judicata
applies
only
after
there's
been
a
full
hearing
and
evidence
taken
on
the
point.
mr.
rutledge
by
--
by
the
decision
that
i
just
cited,
your
honor,
pope
v.--
pope
v.mayo
and
construing
the
statute,
construing
the
statute.
mr.
rutledge
no,
no.
certainly,
a
court
can
say
--
a
court
can
say
that
--
that
you
failed
to
state
of
cause
of
action,
--
mr.
rutledge
--
certainly.
certainly.
mr.
rutledge
without
--
without
hearing
it.
and
apparently,
that
was
supposed
to
done
at
this
first
petition.
the
petition,
as
i
understand,
was
filed
in
1948.
and
it
was
denied
the
very
same
day
it
was
filed.
and
that
first
petition
for
habeas
corpus
didn't
claim,
didn't
make
a
single
claim
about
double
punishment.
indeed,
it
would
have
been
premature
to
have
done
so.
because
even
--
even
if
the
petitioner's
contention
is
about
double
punishment
or
triple
punishment
are
accepted,
he
still
was
at
that
time,
serving
a
valid
sentence
in
jail
and
could
not
challenge
by
habeas
corpus
his
detention.
mr.
rutledge
no
your
honor,
it
is
not.
mr.
rutledge
our
ultimate
position
is
that
florida
having
ruled
that
where
you
take
three
animals
it's
one
offense,
cannot
take
this
man
out
and
single
him
out
and
punish
him
three
times.
mr.
rutledge
precisely,
your
honor.
the
case
is
hearn
versus
state,
was
cited
in
the
brief
where
--where
florida
has
squarely
held
that
if
you
take
these
cattle,
in
that
case,
the
cattle
were
all
what
they
call
on
the
same
range.
the
accused
in
that
case
was
charged
with
having
gone
out
and
rounded
them
up
in
one
transaction,
put
them
in
the
same
loading
pan,
put
them
on
a
truck
and
had
taken
them
away.
and
it
was
--
it
is
as
charged
--
in
that
case
he
was
charged
--
he
was
tried
first
for
stealing
one
out
of
that
group
of
cattle
and
convicted.
and
the
state
then
came
back
and
charged
him
and
tried
to
try
him
again
on
charging
several
other
--
on
stealing
proceedings
of
other
of
the
cattle
in
that
group.
and
it
was
held
ultimately
by
the
florida
supreme
court
that
they
couldn't
do
it
because
--
mr.
rutledge
but
your
honor
--
mr.
rutledge
we
make
that
point
too,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
rutledge
but,
your
honors,
the
--
the
expressed
ground
of
the
hearn
decision
was
the
--
the
taking
of
cattle.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
stated
that
it's
flatly,
that
can
be
stated,
that
the
taking
of
a
number
of
cattle
under
these
circumstances
regardless
of
whether
they
belong
to
the
same
owner
or
not
where
they're
all
taken
under
the
same
circumstances
is
one
offense.
and
having
been
prosecuted
and
conviction
on
that
having
obtained
double
jeopardy
barred,
prosecuting
them
for
another
or
separate.
as
there
--
on
summary
--
mr.
rutledge
the
difficulty
--
mr.
rutledge
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
that
--
that's
right
your
--
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
the
--
the
state
of
--
of
the
law
in
florida
prior
to
the
hearn
case
was,
there's
been
no
decisions
on
the
precise
point.
it
is
true,
i
think,
that's
the
reason
that
this
--
that
this
is
happening.
that
the
state
did
in
this
case,
punish
this
man
three
times
from
one
offense.
i
don't
think
this
is
from
any
malicious
purpose
except
for
the
severity.
it
was
certainly
a
very
superior
sentence.
but
what
happened
was
at
the
hearn
state
--
the
--
the
hearn
b
state
case
came
down,
i
believe,
is
in
1951,
after
the
conviction
of
this
person.
but
was
a
clean
decision,
so
to
speak.
it
didn't
overrule
a
prior
decision.
it
denounced
the
law
as
it
was
then
and
presumably,
as
it
had
always
been.
mr.
rutledge
i
think
it's
very
important
to
say
fiction,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
very
important
fiction.
mr.
rutledge
otherwise,
you'd
--
you
--
you
convert
what
was
one
crime
into
the
three
crimes
or
vice-versa,
three
crimes
under
into
one
crime
at
the
will
of
the
court.
i
don't
believe
that,
that
--
mr.
rutledge
well,
if
the
court
had
overruled
a
prior
decision,
petitioner
would
--
would
accept.
mr.
rutledge
no.
no,
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
a
different
question.
that
would
be
a
certainly,
a
--
a
far
different
question
from
this
case.
where
the
law
as
it
is
pronounced
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida,
has
been,
is
and
presumably
will
be
unless
this
case
is
overruled
where
a
man
takes
any
number
of
cattle
at
one
time,
but
that's
one
offense,
not
two.
mr.
rutledge
i
--i
realize
that,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
we
do
not
address
ourselves
to
the
question
of
whether
the
state
of
florida
had
to
reach
this
--
this
opinion.
we
--
we
accept
that
it
had
reached
it
and
we're
thankful
for
it.
the
--
this
--
this
claim
of
double
punishment
--
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
the
--
the
petition
many
times
makes
that
allegation.
mr.
rutledge
the
--
the
petition
does
your
honor.
repeatedly
the
petition
states
that
the
record
shows,
that
the
evidence
shows
that
the
cattle
taken
on
july
7
were
all
taken
at
the
same
time.
and
that
the
cattle
taken
on
july
29th
were
all
taken
at
the
same
time
on
the
same
circumstances.
in
addition,
the
petitioner
filed
an
affidavit
in
support
of
the
petition
by
two
witnesses
at
the
trial,
not
--
not
witnesses
in
the
trial,
two
spectators
who
viewed
the
trial.
mr.
ralse
and
his
wife.
and
that
affidavit
states
that
the
testimony,
which
were
used
to
convict
petitioner,
showed
that
the
cattle
were
--
were
all
taken
at
the
same
time,
under
the
same
circumstances
as
one
transaction
both
on
july
7
and
on
july
29th.
mr.
rutledge
no
it
is
not,
and
--
and
the
petitioner
doesn't
even
know
whether
--
whether
one
exists
in
the
--
mr.
rutledge
they
were
not
denied,
your
honor.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
having
not
been
denied,
and
no
hearing
having
been
held,
they
must
be
accepted
as
true
for
purposes
of
review
by
this
court.
mr.
rutledge
those,
your
honor,
we
--
we
submit
that
the
--
that
they
are
not
conclusions
of
law.
now
--
now,
this
petition
was
drawn
by
the
petitioner
himself
while
he
was
incarcerated,
in
prison.
mr.
rutledge
we
submit
it
here.
mr.
rutledge
well,
that
is
not.
that
was
my
shorthand
way
of
--
of
phrasing
it
to
your
honor,
but
the
petition,
we
submit,
goes
beyond
that,
considerably
beyond
that
and
states
numerous
times
the
--
here
--
here,
for
example,
is
just
--
mr.
rutledge
that's
right,
your
honor.
this
--
that's
--
mr.
rutledge
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
those
are
allegations
of
fact.
mr.
rutledge
that's
on
--
on
page
3
in
the
second
and
the
third
paragraph
there's
a
second
complete
paragraph.
they're
also
--
that's
repeated
on
--
over
on
page
4.
there's
another
paragraph
down
near
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
record
revealed
by
the
two
codefendant's
testimony.
that
the
three
cattle
were
all
on
the
same
range,
rounded
up
and
killed
at
the
same
time
and
place,
butchered
and
carried
to
the
same
market
on
the
same
truck.
in
short,
it
was
one
continuous
act.
and
again,
the
--
the
various
places
in
the
petition
where
that
allegation
is
made,
both
in
regard
to
the
july
7th
charge
and
the
july
29th
charge
are
--
are
stated
in
the
brief.
and
he
makes
the
allegation
of
fact
in
regard
to
both,
both
five
cattle
that
were
alleged
to
have
been
stolen
on
july
7th
and
the
three
cattle
that
were
alleged
to
have
been
stolen
on
july
29th.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
the
--
the
maximum
penalty
for
the
offense
of
cattle
stealing
is
five
years.
mr.
rutledge
that
--
that's,
right,
your
honor.
we
have
a
gain-time
statute
in
florida
which
--
mr.
rutledge
--
he
served
his
ten
years.
mr.
rutledge
for
two
offenses,
yes,
your
honor,
more
than
served
it.
in
regard
to
the
--
to
the
first
petition,
it
submitted
that
that
petition
certainly
didn't
raise
the
question
of
double
punishment
because
at
that
time,
he
had
not
served
ten-year
sentence.
it
did
contain
within
it
a
brief
statement
that
petitioner
contends
he
was
convicted
on
prejudged
and
perjured
testimony.
no
claim
of
denial
of
federal
right
was
made
in
connection
with
that.
in
any
event,
and
it's
submitted
that
--
that
this
question
was
not
presented
and
that
that
petition
could
properly
have
been
denied
out
of
space
by
the
florida
supreme
court
because
there
was
no
claim
made
in
that
first
petition
that
the
sole
and
exclusive
evidence
used
to
convict
him
was
the
perjured
testimony.
in
other
words,
there
might
have
been
corroboration
in
other
--
and
have
other
circumstances.
mr.
rutledge
your
--
your
honor,
the
--
the
state
has
--
has
not
filed
any
response
to
the
petition.
it
hasn't
denied,
to
my
knowledge,
anything
in
the
petition.
mr.
rutledge
this
--
this
is
the
present
petition
--
mr.
rutledge
--
on
page
--
on
page
4.
present
petition
runs
through
the
page
--
page
8
and
then
it
has
a
number
of
exhibits
attached
to
it.
mr.
rutledge
but
your
honor
it
--
i
don't
know
how
it
could
be
stated
by
--
certainly
by
a
layman
with
any
more
clarity
than
--
than
it
was
there
that
the
record
revealed
by
the
--
by
the
two
codefendants'
testimony
that
the
three
cattle
were
all
on
the
same
range,
rounded
up
and
killed
at
the
same
time
and
place,
butchered,
and
carried
to
the
same
market
on
the
same
truck
and
sure
it
was
one
continuous
act.
and
that
is
the
precise
situation
in
which
was
involved
in
the
hearn
case
where
the
florida
supreme
court
ruled
that
where
that
takes
place,
where
the
--
where
the
stealing
of
cattle
is
one
act,
that
that's
one
offense
and
that
you
can't
divide
it
up
into
the
number
of
cattle
that
were
stolen
and
charge,
and
convict
and
punished
the
man
according
to
the
number
taken.
just
the
same
that
you
can't
punish
a
man
for
--
for
larceny
anymore
if
he
takes
$10
and
if
he
takes
$11.
mr.
rutledge
constitutionally
--
mr.
rutledge
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
rutledge
certainly,
it
may
do
the
latter
if
he
--
if
he
chooses
to
do
so.
if
it
--
if
it
provides
by
--
mr.
rutledge
precisely,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
precisely.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
that's
not
this
case,
we
submit.
mr.
rutledge
they
did
not
-
they
--
they
had
not
construed
the
act
as
the
florida
supreme
court
had
not
construed
the
act
differently
before.
mr.
rutledge
the
--
the
hearn
case
was
a
--
was
a
case
of
first
impression
on
this
matter.
my
understanding
of
it,
is
that
--
that
it
decided
that
the
hearn
case
for
the
first
time
decided
in
the
state
of
florida
has
been
raised
in
montana
and
texas
and
some
of
the
western
states
before.
but
it
--
it
was
decided
in
the
hearn
case
that
where
a
man
takes
a
number
of
cattle,
all
at
one
time,
it's
one
offense.
and
that
was
a
case
of
first
impression
in
florida.
florida
has
only
become
a
cattle
state
in
relative
recent
years,
and
probably
and
apparently
had
not
reached
the
highest
court
before
that
time.
mr.
rutledge
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
it
was.
concerning
the
second
petition,
which
was
filed
by
a
lawyer,
drawn
up
by
a
lawyer,
the
second
petition
did
not
raise
any
question
concerning
perjured
testimony
and
neither,
we
submit,
that
it
raised
the
precise
question
involved
in
this
case.
the
second
petition
was
filed
in
a
lower
baseline
trial
court
for
habeas
corpus.
and
in
that
petition,
the
sole
ground,
the
petitioner
submits
as
will
be
shown
by
a
reading
of
the
petition
was
that
the
informations
in
this
case
on
their
face
were
improper
and
showed
on
their
face
that
they
charged
twice
for
the
same
crime.
indeed,
counsel
in
that
case
pointed
out
that
the
--
that
the
third
count
and
the
second
information
was
identical
word
for
word
except
for
one
slight
change
in
grammar,
i
believe,
with
the
second
account
in
the
--
in
the
second
information.
in
other
words,
you
had
two
counts
in
the
same
information
that
were
word
for
word,
identical.
and
the
--
the
whole
thrust
of
the
attack
in
that
second
petition
for
habeas
corpus
was
on
the
face
of
the
record.
there
was
no
allegation.
petitioner
thinks
this
is
most
important.
there
was
no
allegation
in
that
second
petition
that
the
evidence
produced
by
the
state
showed
that
the
cattle
were
all
taken
at
the
same
time,
same
place,
one
circumstances.
the
--
the
case
--
this
case
of
surprising
similarity
had
previously
come
before
the
florida
supreme
court,
involved
in
a
man
that
is
--
that
was
charged
with
stealing
an
automobile.
and
then
he
was,
also
in
the
same
information,
charged
with
the
crime
of
receiving
an
automobile
knowing
it
was
stolen.
he
was
tried
and
convicted
on
both
counts
of
that
information
and
he
appealed.
and
the
florida
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
--
the
problem
was
not
in
the
charging.
that
the
charge
was
perfectly
all
right.
that
it
would
certainly
be
possible
for
a
man
to
steal
an
automobile
and
also
receive
an
auto
--
an
--
another
automobile
stolen.
but
the
--
the
problem
in
the
case
arose
from
the
evidence
that
was
produced.
and
that
evidence
showed
that
the
same
car
that
the
man
had
stolen
was
also
the
car
that
he
was
charged
with
having
received
then.
and
he
couldn't
steal
it
without
taking
it
away,
so
that
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
in
that
case,
the
man
could
not
be
convicted
on
both
those
charges
and
reversed
the
case
and
remanded
it.
and
it
submitted
that
that's
the
same
problem
in
this
case,
with
that
second
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
raised
only
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
information
and
the
judgments
on
their
face.
and
that
it
did
not
make
the
contention
which
was
made,
in
this
case,
which
is
that
the
evidence,
the
difficulty
was
with
the
evidence
in
this
case.
that
in
this
case,
the
state
used
same
evidence
to
prove
three
separate
different
crimes
exactly.
in
short,
that
the
state
in
this
case
proved
the
same
crime
three
times
and
convicted
and
sentenced
and
punished
this
man
three
times.
the
man,
53
years
old
at
the
time
with
no
previous
criminal
record,
giving
him
each
time
the
maximum
sentence
to
be
served
consecutively,
and
then
on
the
same
day,
likewise,
convicted
him
three
times
for
a
single
offense
committed
on
july
29th,
sentenced
him
to
consecutive
maximum
sentences
of
five
years
each
to
be
served
consecutively
with
those
sentences
imposed
on
the
first
case.
mr.
rutledge
now,
this
--
it
--
in
--
in
this
case
you
mean?
mr.
rutledge
justice
dickinson
is
not
on
the
court.
let's
see,
justice
roberts
and
justice
terrell,
who
is
--
and
justice
--
mr.
rutledge
--
hudson.
they're
all
on
the
court
today.
mr.
rutledge
oh,
sebring,
justice
sebring.
mr.
rutledge
those
judges
are
no
longer
on
the
court.
mr.
rutledge
justice
sebring
and
justice
mathews
and
--
mr.
rutledge
--
chapman,
isn't
it?
now
--
mr.
rutledge
i
--
i
--
mr.
rutledge
it
would
be
a
fair
assumption,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
no,
your
honor,
they're
not.
mr.
rutledge
that
--
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
rutledge
i
did
and
i
--
mr.
rutledge
yes
i
have
your
honor.
i've
treated
it
at
--
at
some
length.
i
anticipated
that
argument
being
made
because
it
was
made
in
the
brief
and
opposition
for
certiorari.
mr.
rutledge
and
have
gone
in
first
--
the
first
answer
is
that
the
--
mr.
rutledge
no
--
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
say
the
florida
can't.
i
say
that
florida
didn't
in
this
case,
as
--
as
i
point
--
point
out
the
--
the
--
first
of
all,
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case
did
not
deny
this
petition
on
the
ground
of
res
judicata.
mr.
rutledge
it
--
no.
it
didn't
just
deny
it
either.
it
denied
it
on
the
grounds
that
petitioner
failed
to
show
probable
cause
that
he
was
unlawfully
in
prison.
mr.
rutledge
and
we
submit
that
that's
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
that
that's
--
that's
a
ruling
saying,
you
failed
to
state
of
cause
of
action.
and
furthermore,
we
--
we
submit,
that
this
defense
of
res
judicata
is
one
that
has
to
be
--
that
--
that
should
be
pleaded.
in
other
words,
a
very
technical
defense.
mr.
rutledge
--it's
--
it's
a
--
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
the
--
those
cases
where
the
florida
supreme
court
has
barred
a
man
from
coming
back
into
court
with
a
second
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
the
court
has
expressly
stated
that
and
examined
into
it
to
see
whether
or
not
the
matter
raised
in
the
second
petition
was
some
--
was
a
matter
adjudicated
in
the
prior
decision.
mr.
rutledge
no,
not
or
could've
been,
not
or
could've
been.
that's
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
and
we
submit
that
under
florida
--
florida
law
that
full
force
of
res
judicata
is
not
applied.
that
--
that
the
florida
statute
bars
only
matters
actually
litigated
and
determined,
not
matters
that
could
have
been.
now
the
state
makes
a
--
mr.
rutledge
the
florida
statute's
in
the
--
in
the
last
page,
i
believe,
your
honor
of
petitioner's
brief.
page
38.
mr.
rutledge
as
to
the
second
question,
the
waiver
question,
and
the
petitioner
just
briefly
make
--
make
the
same
argument.
the
florida
court
has
held,
that
first
of
all,
this
court
has
certainly
committed
the
doctrine
and
so
is
the
florida
supreme
court
that
it
will
not
be
quick
to
rule
that
a
man
waives
his
fundamental
constitutional
rights
and
that
courts
will
indulge
every
reasonable
presumption
against
waiver
of
such
fundamental
rights.
and
certainly,
that
rule
is
most
appropriate
to
apply
in
this
case,
where
the
man
drew
up
his
own
petition
at
one
time
and
in
the
other
case
where
he
--
where
he
drew
--
where
his
lawyer
drew
up
a
one-shot,
very
technical
one,
attacking
the
face
of
the
pleadings.
and
certainly,
the
whole
that
is
failure
to
--
to
raise
this
double
punishment
point
and
his
perjured
testimony
being
the
exclusive
evidence
against
him
would
be
the
most
--
argue
his
result
to
--
to
say
that
by
--
by
failing
to
include
all
of
those
in
one
petition,
he'd
waived,
he'd
consented
to
being
imprisoned
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
i
had
submitted
that
if
the
florida
supreme
court
had
so
held
that
it
would
have
stated
so,
rather
than
simply
stating
that
there
is
no
--
that
he'd
failed
to
show
probable
cause
that
he
was
imprisoned
and
that
unlawfully.
in
that
connection,
i'd
like
to
call
attention
to
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
our
respondent
washington
v.mayo
where
--
where
the
court
did
refer
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
had
made
a
prior
petition
and
had
not
and
it
either
probably
represented
this
point
had
it
determined
or
had
not
chosen
to
raise
it.
and
the
court,
in
that
case,
in
washington
v.mayo,
nevertheless,
went
on
and
fully
considered
the
merits
of
--
of
petitioner's
contentions
and
ruled
against
them.
in
short,
in
that
case,
even
though
there
was
a
pleading
made
of
res
judicata
and
even
though
the
court
discussed
the
fact
that
there'd
been
a
prior
petition
and
that
the
matter
might
well
have
been
determined
in
that
prior
case.
nevertheless,
the
court,
the
florida
supreme
court
went
on
and
considered
the
merits
of
petition.
and
we
cite
a
case,
a
recent
case
by
the
florida
supreme
court,
adopting
the
very
reasonable
rule
that
res
judicata
is
not
an
absolute
doctrine.
it's
not
one
which
the
court
is
bound
to
apply.
and
that
the
court
is
more
interested
in
reaching
a
reasonable
and
a
right
result
than
applying
a
fiction
of
the
law
that
was
--
is
designed
merely
to
terminate
litigation.
so
that
even
if,
even
conceding,
way
down
the
line,
that
the
petitioner
was
barred
by
res
judicata,
the
florida
supreme
court
was
certainly
not
bound
to
--
to
deny
him
on
that
ground
and
certainly
in
this
case,
we
submit,
on
the
face
of
its
order,
did
not
rely
on
that
ground.
mr.
rutledge
but
it
didn't
in
this
case.
mr.
rutledge
it
did
not
in
this
case
and
we
submit
that
in
every
case
where
it
--
where
it
does
apply
such
a
doctrine
of
waiver
or
such
a
doctrine
of
res
judicata,
it
has
done
so
expressly.
coming
to
the
--
the
question
of
--
of
double
punishment,
it's
a
--
petitioner
would
submit
that
the
question,
fortunately,
has
seldom
come
before
the
bar
of
this
court
of
a
state
claiming
the
right
to
punish
a
man
twice
or
three
times
for
a
single
offense.
it's
--
it's
a
power
or
a
right
which
no
state
has
felt
necessary
to
claim.
there's
no
reason
for
it
to
have
the
power.
it's
capable
of
only
abuse.
it's
the
sort
of
power
that
--
that
they're
like
a
sort
of
shotgun.
it
can't
be
used
for
any
legitimate
purpose.
certainly,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
going
back
to
the
ex
parte
lange
decision,
as
stated
eloquently
and
simply.
that
this
court
will
not
permit
the
same
sovereignty
to
punish
a
man
twice
or
three
times
for
the
same
offense.
to
do
so
offends
all
sense
of
fairness
and
justice.
the
state
certainly
has
the
right
to
exact
it
pound
to
flesh
or
to
take
its
tooth
for
a
tooth,
or
an
eye
for
an
eye.
but
to
do
it
twice
and
three
times
out
in
(inaudible)
is
a
matter
that
is
so
shocking.
and
it
certainly
must
be
held
to
be
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
particularly
in
this
case,
where
that
error
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
the
man's
conviction
was
obtained
on
the
admitted
facts
in
this
case,
solely
and
exclusively
by
the
perjured
testimony
of
two
of
his
former
employees,
who'd
decided
that
because
of
his
good
reputation,
because
he
was
their
former
employer,
that
if
they
put
the
onus
on
him,
that
they
would
relieve
themselves
of
full
blame.
certainly,
where
you
have
that
combination
of
circumstances,
right
and
justice
cry
out
that
a
man
not
be
subjected
to
more
than
what
the
state
itself
has
prescribed
to
be
the
maximum
penalty
for
that
crime.
thank
you.
mr.
rutledge
and
your
honor,
i
--
i
have
a
--
a
story
too
that
if
we
go
into
it
it's
--
i
can't
vouch
for
it
but
it's
a
--
it
conflicts
to
a
certain
agree
with
his.
mr.
rutledge
your
honor,
i
would
just
like
to
correct
an
answer
which
i
made
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
corroboration
under
florida
law
as
the
--
my
colleague
pointed
this.
and
for
me,
florida
has
a
rule
that
corroboration
is
not
required
--
mr.
rutledge
--in
support
of
conviction
and
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
an
accomplice.
the
judge
does
charge
the
jury
to
examine
such
testimony
with
care.
i
should
also,
on
the
jurisdictional
point,
like
to
refer
this
court
to
the
williams
versus
georgia
case
which
was
decided,
i
believe,
in
the
last
term
which
stated,
as
i
understand
it,
that
a
state
may
be
freed
to
lay
down
a
rule
that
you
cannot
raise
your
federal
question
except
to
the
particular
point
and
that
a
state
procedural
rule
which
forbids
raising
the
federal
question
at
late
stages
in
the
case
or
by
any
other
than
the
prescribed
method
has
been
recognized
as
a
valid
exercise
of
state
power.
but
the
court
went
on
in
that
case,
as
i
understand
it,
to
say
that
where
the
state
does
allow
such
matters
in
the
court's
discretion,
but
then
the
u.s.supreme
court,
this
court
may
review
the
operation
of
such
discretion,
otherwise,
it
loses
power
over
its
own
jurisdiction,
and
i
submit
that
that
certainly
is
precisely
this
case.
the
case
has
shown
the
florida
supreme
court
certainly
--
we
contend
first
of
all,
if
it
had
any
discretion
in
this
case
at
all,
certainly,
exercised
that
discretion
in
ruling
on
the
merits
of
this
petition,
and
in
any
event,
it
has
a
discretion
as
shown
by
this
decision,
florida
decisions
and
that
discretion,
the
use
of
that
discretion
is
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
i
should
like
to
also
point
out
that
in
regard
to
the
point
of
habeas
corpus
line
to
--
but
general
bowen
refers
to
impeach
the
record
and
i
would
like
to
refer
in
that
regard
to
the
shoemaker
case,
shoemaker
versus
mayo.
in
that
case,
a
man
had
pleaded
guilty
for
the
charge
and
he
was
permitted
by
habeas
corpus
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
--
the
plea
on
the
record
by
claiming
that
at
the
time
he
made
that
plea,
he
was
under
the
influence
of
--
of
a
narcotic
drug.
in
short,
he
was
able
to
go
in
and
challenge
that
plea
by
the
means
of
habeas
corpus,
and
indeed,
this
court,
in
a
very
recent
case,
chandler
versus
fretag
had
before
it,
the
very
same
situation
in
which
general
bowen
mentioned
of
the
record
in
that
case
came
from
tennessee,
specifically
stated
that
counsel
was
present
but
petitioner
in
that
case
was
permitted
by
witnesses
to
come
in
and
show
the
contrary,
the
exact
contrary
that
he
had
no
counsel
and
indeed
after
he
had
made
in
pursuance
of
showing
by
witnesses,
the
state
conceded
the
error
in
the
record.
i
should
also
like
to
point
out
finally,
in
regard
to
this
res
judicata
point,
that
the
(inaudible)
affidavit
-
the
affidavit
which
states
that
these
-
the
evidentiary
point,
in
other
words,
the
condition
of
the
record
that
the
testimony
of
these
two
accomplices
show
that
these
cattle
were
all
taken
at
the
same
time.
that
affidavit
was
never
attached
to
any
prior
petition.
it
was
--
the
affidavit
was
made
in
1955,
i
believe,
and
it
was
attached
only
to
this
last
petition.
and
indeed,
we
submitted
that
if
you
examine
the
1952
petition,
it
will
show
on
its
face
that
it
challenges
only
the
face
of
the
record.
it
states
in
paragraph
2
and
paragraph
5
or
section
-
article
2
or
article
5
of
the
petition.
it
state
that
the
counts
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“do
in
fact
charge
the
one
and
the
same
crime.”
and
again
paragraph
5,
"that
the
two
informations
aforesaid
do
make
out
for
two
crimes."
in
other
words,
the
whole
thrust
of
that
petition
was
at
the
face
of
the
informations,
not
at
what
the
testimony
produced.
this
is
the
only
case
where
petitioner
has
raised
this
point.
that
on
the
evidence
produced
by
the
state,
he
was
unlawfully
convicted
three
times
for
a
single
offense.
thank
you.
