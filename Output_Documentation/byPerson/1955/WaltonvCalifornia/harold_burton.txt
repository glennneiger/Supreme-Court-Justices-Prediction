there's
no
objection
on
the
basis
of
pain
or
suffering
or
torture,
any
of
that
kind?
justice
harold
burton
mr.
linn,
before
you
start
on
that,
your
first
position
is
that
there
was
consent?
justice
harold
burton
and
that
would
dispose
of
the
case
in
your
mind
if
we
find
that
there
was
consent.
justice
harold
burton
suppose
we
don't
find
that
there
is
consent,
but
there
was
no
objection,
what
then?
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
so
that
even
though
there
was
objection,
you
distinguish
this
from
the
rochin
case.
justice
harold
burton
in
california,
if
you
tender
an
instruction,
must
it
be
legally
correct
before
error
can
be
--
justice
harold
burton
--
concluded
by
the
court?
