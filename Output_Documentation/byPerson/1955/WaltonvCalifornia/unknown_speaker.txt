unknown
speaker
have
you
a
reference
to
the
place
that
he
requested
a
counsel
or
is
it
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
don't
have
it
--
unknown
speaker
--
right
in
front
of
me,
don't
make
it
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
he
raised
a
question
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
to
detect
a
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
there
was
in
the
evidence
intoxication
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
did
the
--
did
the
court
charge
anything
under
this
matter?
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
question
was
raised,
your
argument
is,
the
question
was
raised
and
the
evidence
is
not
to
be
admitted.
he
then
objected
to
--
did
admit
(inaudible)
evidence.
now,
(inaudible)
that
it
was
heard
and
you
were
overruled
and
nothing
--
there's
no
further
ruling
in
the
court
to
base
that
out.
except
that
the
court
kept
the
declination
of
your
proposed
charges.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
has
it
--
your
contention
as
to
instructions
less
specifically
raised
--
well,
specifically
raised
the
questions.
unknown
speaker
i
--
i
think
it
was
still
(inaudible)
agreed
on
the
conflict
of
testimonies
as
to
whether
it
was
by
force
or
not.
that
one
testified
one
way
and
the
other
--
or
testified
in
the
other.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you'd
take
the
position
that
if
your
instruction
11
as
been
given,
if
it's
been
given,
that
is
--
and
that's
for
the
jury
to
pass
on
the
question
of
consent
or
not
and
also
to
pass
on
the
judgment
having
passed
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
are
you
depending
on
that?
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn't
in
your
instruction.
unknown
speaker
how
about
fingerprinting?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
often
fingerprinting
is
used
in
prosecutions.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
the
same
way
you
distinguish
the
examinations
of
this
person
being
extendable
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
prosecution,
don't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
your
take
on
--
what
do
you
say
about
x-rays
and
then
a
picture
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
they
can
look
inside
but
they
can't
go
inside?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
think
he
will,
the
way
you're
talking.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
that's
--
that's
california
law.
then
10,
the
instruct
--
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
under
the
due
process
clause
if
brutal
or
shocking
force
is
exerted
in
obtaining
a
blood
test.
i
submit
there
was
no
evidence
of
brutal
or
shocking
force
in
this
case
even
if
there
was
coercion.
and
11,
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
if
they
had
taken
from
him
by
force
and
without
his
consent
and
against
his
protest
and
must
be
disregard
that
entirely.
these
--
these
are
not
matters
that
tie
themselves
into
a
case.
no
municipal
judge,
superior
judge
would
give
instructions
in
this
language.
it's
--
it's
a
kind
that
our
good
friends
of
the
defense
make
to
the
jury
when
they
argue
and
they
threw
them
in
here
before
a
judge
of
this
case.
now
--
unknown
speaker
you
do
think
that
this
record
shows
that
--
that
this
man
did
properly
object
to
the
taking
of
his
blood
for
a
test?
unknown
speaker
it
getting
aside,
it
wasn't
raised
in
time,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
get
it
decided
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
to
think
they
have
--
you
probably
think
they're
reviewing
the
case
rather
than
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
now
what
--
suppose
--
unknown
speaker
--
suppose
it
was
taken
without
his
consent.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
--
won't
we
have
to
think
this
case
as
though
he
never
consented,
that
he
refused
to
consent
in
(inaudible)
and
what
do
the
conviction
state?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
i
assume
the
question
that's
here
before
us
under
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
what
do
you
say
is
the
plain
proposition
is?
if
a
man
is
--
had
his
blood
taken
for
a
test
and
used
against
him
in
a
criminal
case,
whether
or
not
that
denies
or
does
not
deny
due
process
of
law
that
in
itself,
the
taking
of
the
blood
and
using
the
test
denies
due
process
without
his
consent.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
it
does?
