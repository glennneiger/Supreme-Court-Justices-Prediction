mr.
robert
f.
peckham
your
honors,
this
case
arises
from
a
criminal
prosecution
for
driving
under
the
influence
of
liquor
where
blood
was
extracted
by
the
police
to
determine
the
alcoholic
content.
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
by
a
jury
in
his
second
trial
where
he
was
permitted
a
trial
by
jury
and
then
petitioned
to
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court
of
the
state
of
california
being
the
court
of
the
last
resort
under
the
laws
of
california
in
misdemeanor
prosecutions.
the
appellate
department
affirms
the
conviction
and
having
no
further
remedy,
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
and
granted
by
this
court.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
your
honors
is
whether
the
involuntary
extraction
of
petitioner's
blood
by
the
state
police
to
determine
sobriety
and
the
use
of
the
results
of
such
a
blood
test
as
evidence
against
the
petitioner
are
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
privilege
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizures
or
--
and
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
a
further
issue
has
been
raised
in
respondent's
brief
and
that
is
does
the
allocation
of
the
preliminary
questions
of
fact
between
the
judge
and
jury
violates
the
due
process.
now
the
facts
of
this
case
briefly
are
these.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
there
is
not
your
honor.
the
petitioner
left
a
restaurant
--
long
left
shortly
before
10
p.m.
on
a
friday
evening
in
his
sports
automobile
and
drove
across
the
southbound
lane
of
the
el
camino
real,
a
highway
and
into
the
northbound
lane,
the
state
highway
patrol
car
was
following
the
--
along
and
noted
that
the
petitioner
was
speeding
according
to
the
officers'
testimony
and
stopped
the
petitioner.
the
officers
testified
that
he
had
accelerated
his
automobile
to
a
speed
of
60
or
65
miles
per
hour.the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
traveling
approximately
40
miles
an
hour.
after
stopping
him
and
witnessing
him
walk,
the
officers
took
him
to
san
jose
approximately
18
miles
away
to
the
accident
prevention
bureau
and
there
he
was
asked
to
perform
certain
balance
and
coordination
tests
which
he
declined
to
do.
he
also
was
asked
certain
questions
on
a
form
provided
by
the
district
attorney's
office
for
interrogation
by
officers
of
suspected
drunk
drivers
and
he
declined
to
answer
those
questions
with
the
words
“no
comment.”
the
officer
and
the
technician
and
the
petitioner
all
testify
as
to
those
facts
in
substance.
now,
the
officer
testified
that
he
had
declined
to
take
the
blood
test
several
times
when
that
was
requested
of
him.
the
technician
testified
that
he
had
declined
to
take
the
test
at
least
two
times.
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
continued
to
refuse
to
submit
to
the
blood
test
and
that
he
expressed
a
protest
to
it
at
the
time
that
it
was
taken
from
him
against
his
will.
the
officer
of
the
state
highway
patrol
testified
that
the
time
of
taking
the
blood
test,
that
the
petitioner
requested
that
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
--
that
he
be
permitted
to
consult
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer.
and
the
officer
testified
that
this
was
refused
him.
the
officers
testified,
however,
that
he
did
express
after
refusing
these
number
of
times
that
he
did
say,
well
then
go
ahead
and
take
it.
the
petitioner
however
has
testified
that
he
never
did
consent
to
it
and
continued
to
protest.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
not
manhandled
or
mauled.
the
petitioner
testified
that
the
officer
held
his
arm
and
the
technician
inserted
the
needle
to
remove
the
blood
and
the
technician
testified
that
he
did
not
remember
anyone
holding
the
petitioner's
arm
but
of
course,
he
did
inject
the
needle
into
his
veins.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
at
page
84
of
the
record,
the
petitioner
testified
to
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon
--
an
officer
(inaudible)
testimony
is
more
pertinent
there
at
page
43
and
44
and
45.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
we
--
we
submit
that
he
did,
your
honor,
in
this
way.
that
instructions
were
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness
setting
forth
the
constitutional
requirements
that
as
--
as
alleged
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
his
blood
could
not
be
taken
against
his
will
and
without
his
consent.
in
other
words,
the
instructions
which
are
set
forth
on
page
21
of
our
brief
and
also
in
the
record
on
page
144.
those
instructions
were
submitted
and
were
refused
by
the
trial
court.
the
refusal
of
giving
those
instructions
was
assigned
as
error
in
the
statement
of
appeal
that
was
passed
upon
by
the
appellate
department
of
the
superior
court.
petitioner
was
then
taken
to
the
county
jail
where
he
was
permitted
to
make
a
telephone
call.
at
the
trial,
the
criminologist
who
made
the
analysis
testified
that
he
did
not
know
who
made
the
analysis
whether
he
did
or
whether
it
was
assistant
and
it
was
admitted
over
objection.
now
in
this
case,
your
honors,
we
--
we
submit
that
the
failure
to
give
these
instructions
raises
the
federal
question
as
to
whether
or
not
under
the
due
process
clause,
a
person
such
as
petitioner
can
be
compelled
to
give
his
blood
when
he
is
suspected
of
drunk
driving.
we
acknowledge
that
the
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
instructions
8
through
11
are
relevant
in
this
matter.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
it
is
not.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
as
to
what
the
law
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
isn't.
that
under
california
procedure,
the
question
of
voluntariness
is
for
the
jury
to
whether
or
not
he
gave
his
consent.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes,
for
the
jury
to
determine.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
they
perhaps
did
not
specify
the
different
elements
of
what
force
or
coercion
may
be
but
they
do
in
their
entirety
certainly
give
the
judge
the
request
that
if
--
if
there
was
force
or
coercion
exercised
in
the
taking
of
blood
and
it
was
against
his
will
that
then
they
may
--
that
if
they
find
that
that
is
not
true
and
in
fact
was
the
case,
notwithstanding
the
officer's
testimony
that
the
petitioner
said,
“we'll
take
it,”
then
they
should
disregard
the
blood
test
results
and
consider
only
the
other
evidence.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
i
would
submit
so
your
honor.
and
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
if
there
is
a
preliminary
--
if
there
is
a
--
if
--
if
as
a
matter
of
law
the
--
arguing
now
from
an
analogy
to
coerced
confessions,
if
as
a
matter
of
law,
my
understanding
is,
that
a
confession
has
been
coerced
on
the
objection,
a
preliminary
and
a
preliminary
examination
by
the
court
it
can
then
be
excluded.
if
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
evidence,
the
issue
of
voluntariness
where
the
content
was
given
or
not
is
one
for
the
jury.
it
is
my
understanding
that
it's
analogous
to
an
admission,
that
then
the
ultimate
issue
of
volunteering
is
--
is
one
for
the
jury.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
there
--
there
was,
your
honor
and
there
are
also,
of
course,
where
the
evidence
that
there
was
not
intoxication
including
four
other
witnesses
besides
the
petitioner
testifying
on
his
behalf
as
well
as
the
officer
and
the
technician
testifying
that
there
was
indications
of
intoxication.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
no,
it
did
not.
there
were
no
--
there
were
no
instructions
at
all,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
voluntariness
or
in
connection
with
any
of
the
subject
matter
of
these
instructions.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
your
honor,
i
--
i
must
--
i
must
point
this
out,
that
there
were
objections
made
to
the
evidence.
in
the
first
instance,
the
court
interrupted
counsel
and
overruled
before
any
ground
was
stated.
subsequently,
there
was
a
motion
to
strike
and
i
believe
the
ground,
there
also
was
some
colloquy
there
as
i
recollect
the
nature
of
the
interruption
but
ideally
it
was
indicated
the
objections
on
the
ground
of
hearsay.
and
then
these
instructions
were
submitted.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
it
was
not
--
it
was
--
it
does
not
appear
--
it's
not
in
the
record
your
honor,
no.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
that's
right.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
that's
right.
there
are
objections.
in
the
first
instance,
there
is
no
ground
stated.
when
the
blood
itself
and
the
blood
sample
itself
was
admitted,
counsel
was
interrupted
and
there
was
no
ground
stated.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
that
is
page
51.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well
i
--
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
it's
a
general
circumstance
surrounding
this,
your
honor,
and
counsel
did
submit
these
instructions
and
that
our
--
our
basic,
of
course,
our
basic
contention
is
that
this
adequately
raised
this
issue
for
the
trial
court.
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
an
adjudication
of
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
gave
his
consent.
and
our
view
is
that
if
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
at
--
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
no,
appellate
department
without
an
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
if
that
--
if
that
were
the
law,
that
i
assume
is
--
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
--
but
may
i
say
this,
at
that
time,
there
was
not
the
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
it
was
involuntary.
the
--
it
wasn't
until
the
presentation
of
the
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
and
the
petitioner
in
his
own
testimony
that
the
conflict
in
the
record
appeared.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony,
your
honor,
i
don't
recall
a
motion
to
strike
being
shown
in
the
record.
i
--
the
--
he
did
--
he
did
make
the
objection
as
i
stated
it
earlier
and
--
and
--
but
without
stating
this
ground.
but
it's
our
--
but
on
cross-examination,
he
did
ask
the
officers,
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
did
ask
the
officers
whether
or
not
it
was
with
his
consent
and
they
stated
that
--
that
it
was.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
no,
i
was
not
your
honor.
and
therefore
--and
therefore,
it
wasn't
until
the
presentation
of
this
issue
as
to
voluntariness
or
when
petitioner
states
in
chief
that
it
came
before
the
court
and
then
the
element
issue
of
voluntariness
was
such
a
clear
cut
conflict.
there
would
be
one
for
the
jury
under
our
state
law
is
our
contention.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
--
it's
our
contention
that
--
that
in
as
much
as
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
consent
was
never
adjudicated
below
and
that
it
would
be
part
of
due
process
that
it
be
adjudicated,
if
in
fact,
a
compulsory
involuntary
blood
test
is
and
thus
violates
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
in
other
words,
in
as
much
as
there
was
not
a
voluntary
--
an
adjudication
of
this
issue
and
if
taking
the
defendant's
view
of
the
case,
there
would
be
a
such
compulsion
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
due
process,
then
it
would
be
--
then
it
was
essential
that
he
have
an
adjudication
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
he
would
pass
on
it
in
his
determination
of
the
instruction
and
apparently
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes.
we
acknowledge,
your
honors,
that
the
force
and
coercion
employed
here
were,
of
course,
less
violent
and
more
subtle
than
that
found
in
the
rochin
case,
but
nonetheless,
the
force
is
nonetheless
present
in
that
the
blood
was
taken
against
his
will
and
over
his
protest.
and
as
he
stated
himself
in
the
record,
that
at
the
point
when
the
blood
was
to
be
taken
from
his
veins,
the
only
thing
left
for
him
to
do
was
to
resort
to
resistance
of
a
physical
nature
and
that
he
thought
that
the
only
thing
--
that
that
would
--
and
that
would
aggravate
the
situation.
just
as
with
coerced
confession
cases,
the
coercion
is
not
alone
confined
to
violence
and
brutality
but
also
other
less
violent
and
brutal
circumstances
have
been
held
to
cause
a
confession
not
to
stand.
now,
in
this
situation
where
we
have
an
analogy
as
was
brought
out
in
the
rochin
case
with
the
coerced
confessions
where
you
have
the
extraction
of
real
evidence,
you
have
a
somewhat
different
situation
in
this
respect
that
the
length
of
time
is
not
particularly
or
necessarily
a
factor
in
that
when
once
over
the
protest
and
against
the
will
of
the
petitioner,
the
police
attempt
to
take
the
blood
from
his
veins,
he
is
faced
with
three
alternatives
at
that
time.
it
is
not
the
question
of
how
great
the
coercion
is
or
how
--
over
how
long
a
period
of
time
it
goes
in
order
to
see
if
the
pressure
was
so
great
that
he
no
longer
could
resist
the
coercion.
but
at
that
point
regardless
of
the
amount
of
time,
he
must
determine
whether
he
is
to
submit
and
just
continue
orally
to
protest
or
whether
he
is
to
resort
to
physical
resistance
and
thereby
bring
--
in
a
sense
bring
himself
within
the
rochin
doctrine
if
the
officers
themselves
go
on
with
further
restraint
to
extract
the
blood.
otherwise,
he
is
--
he
is
--
and
for
that
reason
we
submit
that
the
--
that
a
--
an
extraction
from
the
body
of
blood
is
a
violation
of
due
process
when
taken
against
his
will
and
over
his
protest
irrespective
of
the
degree
of
force
used
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
they
are
in
--
in
this
way.
in
the
statement
of
appeal
which
is
a
part
of
the
transcript,
the
first
certification
and
that's
on
page
147,
the
first
assignment
of
error
is
that
the
court
erred
in
refusing
the
proposed
instruction
8
through
11
submitted
by
the
defendant.
we
submit,
your
honors,
of
what
is
offensive
to
our
sense
of
fairness
in
this
case
is
the
intrusion
of
the
person
against
his
will
and
not
the
degree
of
force
and
brutality
that
is
used.
we
submit
that
one
medical
procedure
does
not
differ
from
another
in
this
respect
in
that
both
caused
the
entry
into
the
body
of
the
defendant
for
the
extraction
of
blood.
the
--
the
extraction
of
blood
falls
also
--
and
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
submit
outside
the
scope
of
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure
as
well
as
falling
below
the
minimal
standards
of
due
process.
here
we
have
an
intrusion,
which
is
a
--
we
submit
a
violation
of
the
privacy
of
the
individual.
his
blood
was
--
the
extraction
of
blood
under
these
circumstances
is
certainly
not
within
the
classical
concept
of
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure
and
--
and
it's
not
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
obtaining
the
fruits
of
a
crime
or
its
instrumentalities
or
weapons
that
might
endanger
the
officer
or
effectuate
escape.
the
unreasonableness
manifest
itself
further
in
the
fact
that
he
was
refused
the
right
to
consult
a
doctor
or
an
attorney
at
that
time
that
he
was
requested
to
have
his
blood
extracted
from
him.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
as
one
of
the
circumstances,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
it
--
it
was
not,
it
was
evidence,
i
would
--
i
would
take
it,
your
honor.
it
was
evidence
on
which
the
jury
could
--
could
weigh
in
--
in
determining
the
issue
of
fact
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
--
of
the
extraction
of
the
blood.
i
submit
that
in
california
today,
that
in
all
probability,
judging
from
the
decision
of
people
against
the
language
in
the
decision
of
people
against
(inaudible)
that
the
taking
of
blood
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
would
be
deemed
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
that
was
a
case
where
a
--
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court
before
the
irvine
case
and
its
consequent
repercussions
in
our
state
in
the
form
of
people
against
cahan
and
in
--
and
there,
a
woman
was
involved
in
an
accident
and
taken
under
the
supervision
of
the
state
police
to
a
hospital
and
a
blood
taken
from
her
veins
not
only
for
medicinal
purposes
but
also
for
purposes
of
determining
the
alcoholic
content.
the
--
the
court
commented
there
while
not
expressly
holding
that
there
was
--
that
it
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
but
certainly
clearly
by
implication
by
pointing
out
that
the
rule
in
our
state
at
that
time
before
people
against
cahan
was
not
of
course
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
which
is
now
is.
and
therefore,
the
evidence
though
indicating
that
it
was
improperly
taken,
when
it
was
taken
from
her
when
she
was
unconscious
without
her
consent
would
be
a
--
would
indicate
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
now
under
people
versus
cahan,
the
rule
of
course
in
our
state
is
that
evidence
obtained
by
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
is
to
be
excluded
and
not
considered.
now,
in
the
--
the
respondent's
brief,
there
is
cited
a
legislation
of
states
where
blood
tests
are
required
for
different
purposes.
we
submit
that
none
of
those
legislative
enactments
that
are
cited
being
under
the
police
power
are
for
the
purpose
of
extracting
evidence
to
be
used
against
the
petitioner,
that
they
have
as
their
purpose
the
protection
of
the
safety,
health
and
welfare
of
the
people
and
not
as
their
essential
requirement
of
the
extraction
of
evidence
to
be
used
against
a
defendant
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
your
honor,
that
does
not
--
in
--
it's
the
--
it
does
not
include
the
invasion
of
the
body
but
the
intrusion
into
the
very
person
himself.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
it
is
our
contention
that
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
but
it's
our
--
it's
our
contention,
your
honor,
that
this
case
and
any
cases
involving
the
intrusion
of
the
body
differ
from
those
cases
of
trying
on
a
garment
or
of
a
line
up
or
a
fingerprinting
on
the
ground
that
the
person
himself
is
violated
by
the
intrusion
in
obtaining
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
that
isn't
a
criminal
case,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
i
--
i
know
under
our
--
it's
--
as
to
my
understanding
under
our
state
that
when
you
--
of
course
when
you
file
an
action
for
tort
damages
that
you
waive
any
privilege
that
you
may
have
to
refuse
to
consent
as
a
part
of
your
action
in
tort,
you
have
to
submit
to
a
--
at
least
one
physical
examination.
and
--
and
that
would,
of
course,
be
the
basis
of
our
distinction.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
i
assume
there
would
be.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
it's
so
universal
with
then,
it
may
have.
but
i
must
--
i
might
say
your
honor
that
--
that
there
are
two
cases
that
what
we've
--
that
were
decided
by
lower
federal
courts
indicating
that
the
extraction
from
the
body
would
be
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
notwithstanding
the
validity
of
an
arrest
in
connection
with
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
in
the
united
states
versus
willis,
it
was
the
--
it
were
capsules
of
narcotics.
it
was
very
--
the
factual
situation
was
similar
to
the
extraction
of
narcotics
from
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
yes
--
yes,
it
is
in
our
--
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
u.s.
versus
willis
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
you
--
on
page
3.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
it's
a
--
it's
a
matter
--
it's
--
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
there
is
a
--
there
is
of
course
a
--
a
reproduction
of
the
contents
of
a
body
and
if
that
reproduction
could
be
--
could
be
used
for
evidence,
it
perhaps
would
--
would
fall
within
this
doctrine.
but
there
of
course
again
we
have
a
--
a
situation
where
the
body
itself
is
not
imposed
upon
to
the
extent
that
it
is
where
a
medical
procedure
is
utilized
that
causes
the
intrusion
of
the
body
with
instruments.
here,
of
course,
there
are
rays
which
reproduced
a
photograph
in
layman's
sense
of
the
contents
of
the
body.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
--
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
certainly
under
the
--
under
the
doctrine
of
--
under
the
rule
--
under
the
doctrine
of
privileges
against
self-incrimination
if
that
were
to
be
the
basis
of
such
a
--
of
cases
such
as
this
where
there's
an
extraction
of
real
evidence,
then,
of
course,
that
clearly
would
also
be
--
a
manner
that
would
fall
within
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
if
--
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
--
that
in
--
that
such
intrusion
of
the
body
that
amounts
to
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
should
result
in
the
reversal
of
a
conviction.
and
we
submit
that
any
such
force
exercised
for
the
extraction
of
such
evidence
would
justify
such
a
reversal.
we
note
the
language
that
contained
in
the
irvine
case
where
in
it
is
pointed
out
that
there
was
an
intrusion
of
the
person
in
rochin
as
compared
with
that
in
irvine.
and
that
we
also
submit
and
i
have
already
related
to
this
that
in
the
event
there
was
a
--
that
this
occasion
arose
in
our
state
today
under
the
doctrine
of
people
against
cahan,
which
now
has
instituted
in
our
state
as
a
rule
of
evidence,
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
that
this
evidence
would
not
be
permissible
if
it
were
in
fact
involuntary.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well,
it's
--
as
i
recollect
that
is
the
case
of
trying
on
the
--
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
--
on
the
garment.
well,
there
again
your
honor,
there
is
not
a
violation
of
the
person
in
the
sense
of
--
of
intrusion
into
the
body
through
the
use
of
a
medical
procedure.
there
--
that
case
is
--
is
--
i
would
-
i
would
place
in
the
category
of
the
fingerprints
and
also
the
--
the
lineup.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
well
under
--
considering
that
this
arises
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
have
viewed
it
under
the
--
under
what
falls
below
the
minimal
standards
of
due
process
is
also
what
would
be
considered
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
for
that
reason,
i
--
i
submitted
that
the
fingerprinting
would
not
perhaps
be.
mr.
robert
f.
peckham
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'm
clear
with
my
argument.
