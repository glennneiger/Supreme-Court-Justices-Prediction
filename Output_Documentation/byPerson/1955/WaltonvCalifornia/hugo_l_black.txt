an
objection.

no.
justice

no.
justice

l.
black
what
did

the

justice
hugo

but
that

that
objection
wouldn't
apply
hearsay
but
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
--
here,
there
was
--
the
blood
was
(inaudible)
and
he
objected
this
way,
that
objection
is
printed
up
in
the
evidence
here.
and
the
court
said
that
objection
overruled
(inaudible)

and
i
will

had
gone
in
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
conviction,
a
ground
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
but
that's
the
general
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
i
would
think
that
you
were
saying
that
as
you
raise
the
question
--
you
wanted
to
raise
the
question.
let's
assume
now
that
--
(inaudible)
of
this
law
some
other
purpose,
that
if
you
compel
the
evidence,
the
state
of
it
will
violate
the
(inaudible)
are
there
any
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
good
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
assume
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
raise
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
power
for
the
--
we
have
to
(inaudible)
the
charge.
what
would
they
--
there
was
a
criminal
basis
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
took
away
from
it
and
they
say
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
the
court
reach
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
the
court
resolve
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
but
i
didn't
see
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge
(inaudible)
that
it
was
admissible
even
though
they
should
be
away
from
it.
they
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
have
been
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
decide
it
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
have
that
(inaudible)
if
you
have
the
conflicting
evidence,
one,
(inaudible)
what
other
way
it
raised
the
question
(inaudible)
--
that's
--
if
you
want
to
raise
the
question
that
this
was
for
--
the
jury
ought
to
find
that.
and
if
they
find
that
(inaudible)
they'd
have
to
get
to
the
trial.
what
way
except
the
charge
that
he
have
done
it?
why
would
he
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
evidence
is
the
only
evidence
he
have,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
the
blood
was
offered,
he
didn't

on
the
blood
result.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
51.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
--
whatever
it
was
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
as
to
the
charge,
there
was
evidence.
the
judgment
is
by
the
jury
or
by
the
--
decide
it
either
way,
that
conflict.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
can't
ask
for
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
hold
--
be
weighed
as
something,
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
i
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you've
just
said
a
moment
ago
that
it
might
have
been
for
that
reason,
i've
done
it
long
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
it
possible
to
tell
how
the
jury's
finding
of
voluntariness
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
reason
that
the
judge
didn't
decide
--
they
found
that
it
was
voluntary.
they
had
(inaudible)
by
the
question.
so
that
you
simply
have
a
question
of
--
submitted
though
about
voluntariness
and
they've
said,
as
it
--
it
was
held
that
to
be
involuntary,
we
want
you
to
tell
us
(inaudible)
that
you
cannot
consider
this
blood
test
at
all
that
we
shall
determine.
there's
no
consequences
so
far
as
the
charge
that
the
jury
had
to
decide
whether
it's
vague,
whether
it's
voluntary
or
not.
so
how
can
we
know
whether
they
can
find
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
charge
had
been
given
enough
for
us
since
they
had
considered
it
(inaudible).
they
wouldn't
know
whether
this
was
given
a
basis
(voice
