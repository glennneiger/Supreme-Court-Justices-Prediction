mr.
attorney
general
please
the
court.
in
a
serious
matter
of
this
kind,
where
i
submit
the
--
the
liberty
of
the
right
against
physical
entry
into
the
body
of
a
person
who
is
involved,
i
would
regard
it
as
perhaps
less
than
necessary
to
be
flippant
about
some
matters
as
my
friend,
the
general
has
been.
but
nevertheless,
if
i
may
proceed
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised,
some
of
the
justices
at
court,
i
think
it
will
become
evident
that
question
--
federal
question
was
raised
below,
and
that
rochin
--
whatever
the
checklist
of
brutalities
that
this
court
sought
fit
to
write
into
it
is
still
available
to
the
petition.
now,
first,
question
was
raised
by
a
number
of
the
justices
and
mr.
justice
reed,
the
first
one
who
asked
about
it,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
involuntariness
of
the
matter
was
raised.
well,
we
submit
that
it
was.
and
mr.
attorney
general's
answer
to
or
attempted
answer
to
the
fact
that
we
don't
know
what
the
trial
judge
considered
in
the
matter
in
excluding
or
rather
in
receiving
that
evidence
is
no
answer
because
the
counsel
below,
mr.
dimaria,
was
permitted
to
argue
to
the
jury,
the
question
of
involuntariness.
now
if,
as
the
attorney
general
says
to
your
honors,
i
don't
know
what
persuaded
the
judge
below
in
receiving
the
evidence.
i
don't
know
what
motivation
he
had
in
refusing
to
give
the
instructions
but
in
any
rate,
i
wouldn't
read
into
it,
a
determination
that
he
did
not
think
there
was
force
applied.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
answer
--
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
answer
by
referring,
if
you
will,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
page
120
and
this
is
from
the
argument
to
the
jury.
and
i
will
be
--
given
with
your
permission
and
patience
to
read
it
because
it
is
--
it's
rather
lengthy.
i
knew
it
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
focus
the
matter.
this
is
mr.
dimaria
speaking
in
behalf
of
the
defendant
below
and
petitioner
here.
now,
i
would
like
to
bring
up
the
question
here
of
the
testimony
of
mr.
walton,
relative
to
his
being
forced
to
give
a
blood
test
and
i
think
that
should
be
considered
very
seriously
by
the
jury,
because
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
police
state.
it
is
brutal
and
shocking
conduct
in
the
part
of
officers
to
inject
a
needle
into
a
person
and
withdraw
blood.
if
we
permit
that,
it
is
the
next
step
to
inserting
a
needle
and
injecting
some
truth
serum.
it
is
the
next
step
to
permit
in
the
soviet
police
states
to
get
anything.
brainwashing
is
next.
get
anything
you
want
from
not
an
accused,
let's
call
him
the
victim,
and
that
is
something
i
think
that
this
jury
should
not
condone,
should
stop,
it
did
its
tracks.
it
is
not
american.
and
mr.
dimaria
goes
on
to
say,
now,
there
is
another
thing,
the
question
may
come
up
as
to
whether
it
was
taken
against
his
will.
testimony
is
without
contradiction
that
right
after
the
blood
test,
mr.
walton
was
belligerent
not
cooperative.
refused
to
answer
questions
except
if
you
brought
out
and
he
was
still
belligerent
after
the
blood
test.
it
is
logical
that
he
would
refused
to
answer
questions,
that
he
would
refuse
to
walk
a
line,
take
any
test,
is
it
logical?
i'm
sorry.
that
he
would
refuse
to
answer
questions,
that
he
would
refuse
to
walk
a
line,
take
any
test,
yet,
permit
the
insertion
of
a
needle
into
his
arm
to
take
a
blood
test.
i
submit
it
isn't.and
i
submit
the
blood
sample
was
taken
from
mr.
walton
without
his
consent
despite
his
protest
and
by
force.
now
this,
if
the
court
please,
with
that
conclusion
of
the
case
at
a
time
when
the
court
below
had
received
evidence
and
if
the
judge
had
made
the
determination
which,
the
attorney
general,
would
lead
to
us
to
believe
he
did
as
to
the
voluntariness,
would
he
not
then
have
cut
off
the
attorney
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
at
that
point.
mr.
attorney
general
they
are
submitted
before
the
charge
is
made.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
practice,
they
are
submitted,
under
our
rule,
they
are
required
to
be
submitted
before
the
case
starts.
that
is
before
a
witness
has
sworn.
there
is
some
leniency,
thank
heavens,
but
the
point
is,
that
the
instructions
are
permitted
very
early
in
the
case
and
they
were
so
submitted
here.
and
i
might
say,
i
might
observe
one
other
thing
is
perhaps
parenthetically,
these
instructions
must
have
been
submitted
before
the
trial
started
in
the
morning
and
certainly
perhaps,
during
the
recess
because
the
entire
case,
6,
7
witnesses
in
all
including
the
impanelment
of
the
jury
and
the
consideration
of
the
jury
and
their
finding
took
only
one
thing.
so
those
instructions
have
been
submitted
to
the
court.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
may
i
answer
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
please,
is
that
in
abstract,
i
would
put
it
that
way
with
your
permission,
that
may
have
been
testimony
which
had
been
coming
in
on
both
sides
and
raise
the
conflict,
but
under
our
practice,
we
are
entitled
to
instructions
on
the
law
and
these
instructions,
numbers
8
to
11,
particularly
number
11,
do
raise
the
question
of
law
as
they
are
to
circumscribe
the
conflict
in
evidence
which
under
trial
may
have
been.
and
for
that
reason,
your
honor,
i
would
say
to
justice
frankfurter
that
that
matter
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury
as
a
matter
of
law
and
we
were
entitled
to
instructions.
mr.
attorney
general
it
didn't,
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
we
submit,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
in
the
court
above,
in
the
appellate
term,
we
would
be
denied
the
right
of
review,
the
right
of
that
judicial
review
of
the
court
below
unless
we
had
raised
the
question
of
voluntariness
by
request
of
the
charge
for
a
determination
by
the
jury,
request
the
charge
and
instruct
the
jury
on
matters
of
law
as
they
apply
to
the
conflict
of
the
facts.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
precisely
the
point
mr.
--
mr.
attorney
general
well
--
mr.
attorney
general
except
--
mr.
attorney
general
well
then,
mr.
justice
black,
it
searches
the
record
in
this
respect.
that
is
we
understand
some
decisions
on
the
role
of
the
judge
--
of
the
jury
and
we
mentioned
stein
in
pressing
and
referred
to
others
as
to
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
confessions,
coerced
confessions.
it
is
a
question
for
determination
by
someone
preliminarily
as
to
whether
or
not
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
submission
to
the
injection
of
the
needle
and
the
extraction
of
this
blood
was
one
that
was
voluntarily
given
by
walton,
the
petitioner.
now,
the
objections
were
raised
as
we
went
along
and
it's
pertinent
to
observe.
mr.
justice
black
did
on
--
i
believe
page
51.
it's
very
pertinent
to
observe
that
when
the
exhibit
1
for
identification
was
being
offered
--
were
referred
to,
and
the
testimony
of
the
expert
who
had
drawn
the
blood,
mr.
(inaudible),
technician,
was
being
handled.
an
objection
was
proposed
to
be
offer,
and
it
was
cut
off.
now
i
am
not
on
a
mission
and
i
am
not
proposing
to
stand
here
to
state
to
this
honorable
court,
precisely,
what
it
is
that
mr.
dimaria
had
in
mind
when
he
was
stopped
at
the
point,
i
object
that
its
introduction
into
evidence
is
“dash.”
the
court
objection
will
be
overruled
but,
i
would
attribute
to
trial
counsel
below.
that
understanding
of
the
law,
which
is
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
he
had
instructions
on
the
law,
to
have
had
in
mind
that
if
he
were
permitted
to
complete
his
objection,
he
would
have
raised
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
the
same
thing
that
was
taken,
exhibit
1,
that
he
was
cut
off
--
mr.
attorney
general
well
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
reed,
in
answer
to
that,
that
we
deal
with
what
is
known
as
sometimes
referred
to
as
formula
instructions.
we
have
what
is
known
as
a
body
of
instructions
contained
in
a
book
which
had
been
superintended
and
supervised
by
our
superior
courts.
they
are
instructions
in
form
with
citations
at
the
bottom
of
cases
to
which
those
instructions
apply.
and
in
submitting
these
instructions,
lawyers
are
very
careful
and
i
would
critique
mr.
dimaria
to
have
done
the
very
same
thing,
to
submit
instructions
under
law
as
applicable
to
particular
facts
as
they
devolved
themselves
in
the
trial
and
my
answer
there
is
that
these
instructions
--
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
i
wouldn't
think
so.
but
generally
that
is
the
rule.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
i
have
an
answer
of
some
help,
at
least
i
think
it
will
be
of
some
help
to
the
court.
the
procedure
and
practice
is
that
when
instructions
are
presented
by
both
sides
in
the
morning,
that
sometimes
during
the
course
of
the
day
as
the
trial
proceeds,
the
judge
has
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
instructions
and
having
examined
the
instructions,
he
then
has
the
opportunity
and
the
practice
is
to
then
sometime,
particularly
during
recess,
to
call
counsel
in
the
chambers
and
discuss
the
instructions
as
to
whether
or
not
they
apply
or
keep
the
facts
in
the
case.
nothing
of
that
sort
was
done
here.
there
was
just
a
simple
refusal.
for
whatever
reason,
the
judge
below
thought
it
desirable,
just
a
simple
refusal
to
these
--
to
the
instructions.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
the
last
court
of
resort
in
a
misdemeanor
case
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
in
this
kind
of
a
case
by
the
judicial
counsel
--
the
rules
of
the
judicial
counsel
which
set
up
the
municipal
court
and
appeals
from
there
declare
and
we
have
cited
it
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
attorney
general
(inaudible)
retrieve
my
questions
at
the
end,
so
that
i
shall
try
in
that
seven
minutes
of
time
to
complete
it.
the
--
again
the
question
of
voluntariness,
the
attorney
general
read
at
page
52
and
again,
i'm
reminded
of
the
--
that
is
--
it
isn't
what
is
in
the
letter,
it
is
how
one
reads
it.
and
i
would,
in
the
interest
of
saving
time,
simply
read
the
questions.
in
fact,
he
refused
to
cooperate
in
any
way,
pretty
much
that
way,
question
up
until
the
blood
test
was
taken,
and
so
yes.
now
if
i
would
place
emphasis
at
that
point,
there's
an
indication
that
the
complaint
as
to
the
exaction
of
the
blood
was
consistent
and
through
out.
now
then,
as
to
the
question
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
a
doctor,
well
that
observation
was
made
in
a
rather
flippant
manner
by
my
friend
in
citing
to
you
and
i
paraphrase
it,
i
don't
know
that
i
have
the
words,
the
deserving
young
man
called
his
bartender.
well,
the
record
reflects
that
at
the
time
when
he
was
afforded
the
opportunity
to
call
anyone,
he
called
the
owner
of
the
restaurant
he'd
visit
that
time.
when
bail
had
already
been
set
and
he
called
the
owner
of
the
restaurant
and
so
that
bail
would
be
furnished
for
his
release.
and
i
won't
burden
the
court
any
longer
on
that
matter
except
to
refer
to
the
testimony
of
officer
shannon
at
pages
43,
pages
44,
pages
46
all
on
the
subject
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
giving
of
the
blood
and
your
honors
will
permit
me
if
i
don't
read
from
it
in
the
interest
of
conservation
of
time,
but
evidence
is
there
that
he
persisted
to
refuse.
now,
i
should
like
to
go
into
one
matter.
we
have
hold,
as
we
should,
the
toll
placed
upon
lives
and
property
on
the
high
roads,
by
drunk
drivers.
we
feel
that
we
are
here
in
the
protection
of
what
we
think
is
a
very
sacred
right
within
the
general
concepts
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
we
feel
also
that
it
isn't
enough
to
come
before
this
honorable
body,
with
a
checklist,
of
what
was
said
in
rochin.
and
then
to
line
up
what
occurred
here
and
to
say,
“q.
e.
d.,
quod
erat
demonstrandum.
this
isn't
the
same
case
and
therefore,
the
petitioner
here
is
not
entitled
to
the
relief
if
we
seek.”
my
premise
is
that
the
entry
into
the
body
for
the
purpose
of
extraction
of
blood
is
very
sacred
to
the
person.
it
isn't
enough
for
the
attorney
general
to
point
to
such
statutes
or
municipal
ordinances
which
require
as
a
condition
of
the
exertion
of
the
privilege
that
blood
test
be
available.
for
instance,
it
is
a
privilege
to
be
married
would
not
cause
the
concept
that
no
provisions
or
contracts
be
made
to
prevent
marriage
that
is
against
the
policy.
what
it
is
within
the
public
health
and
safety,
and
the
community's
interests,
that
is
the
condition
to
marriage
that
a
person
be
furnished
a
sample?
and
the
other
illustrations,
which
were
given
by
the
attorney
general,
are
all
in
the
area
of
the
privileges,
which
people
seek
as
a
condition
for
which
a
blood
test
is
required.
now
i
should
like
to
advert
for
a
moment
to
this
matter
of
the
right
of
an
individual,
the
inherent
right
to
resist
entry
into
him
for
the
exaction
of
blood
for
use
in
a
criminal
prosection.
and
incidentally,
i
might
say
that
in
all
of
the
illustrations
given
by
the
attorney
general,
of
the
exaction
of
blood,
of
privileges
and
also
none
of
those
that
he
cited
are
in
connection
with
a
criminal
trial.
the
result
of
the
exaction
of
blood
and
its
analysis
would
be
to
imprison
the
person.
now,
in
new
york,
the
commission
in
new
york,
crime
commission
and
this
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
and
i
refer
to
it
for
two
reasons,
first,
because
the
attorney
general
referred
to
it
in
his
--
in
his
brief.
and
i
refer
to
it
to
indicate
that
enlightened
states,
enlightened
legislatures,
and
communities
have
found
a
way
in
which
to
equate
the
need
of
the
savings
of
lives
and
the
prevention
of
a
holocaust
cause
by
drunk
driving,
equating
that
with
the
needs
to
still
preserve
due
process
of
law
within
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
in
new
york,
in
1953,
legislation
has
been
passed
on
this
precise
issue.
we
have
quoted
it
in
our
brief
is
--
slight
error,
some
few
words
were
left
out
and
with
this
court's
permission,
we
will
go
to
the
clerk's
office
and
write
to
him
the
correction.
i
might
say
my
brother
here,
worked
through
the
night
one
time
and
we
just
missed
in
proofreading
a
few
words.
but
the
statute
is
quoted,
under
that
statute
in
new
york.
now,
today,
the
problem
of
--
the
problem
--
thank
you,
mr.
justice
black.
the
problem
of
dealing
with
drunk
driving
and
compulsory
testing
of
the
blood
has
been
adequately
met
in
that
the
right
to
drive
itself
is
a
privilege
and
the
statute
has
imposed
an
