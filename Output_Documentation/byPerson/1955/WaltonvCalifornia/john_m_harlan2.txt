could
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
before
you
go
on,
apropos
what
you
were
suggesting
to
mr.
justice

supposing
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
taking
of
this
blood
test
without
this
man's
consent
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
we
couldn't
see
from
the
record,
ascertained
from
the
record
what
the
ground
was
on
which
the
requested
instruction
was
refused.
wouldn't
we
then
have
to
send
the
case
back
for
a
new
trial
on
that
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
asked
for
deferment.
justice

you
have
your
briefs
in
the

how
this
question
was
argued
before
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they're
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
might
throw
some
light
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
the
ground
of
the
state
court's
decision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
counsel's
argument
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
