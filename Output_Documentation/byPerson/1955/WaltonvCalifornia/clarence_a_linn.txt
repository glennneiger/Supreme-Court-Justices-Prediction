mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
think
the
proper
consideration
of
this
case
demands
a
more
particular
look
at
the
facts.
first,
as
to
the
testimony
concerning
the
actual
happenings
and
then
also
as
to
the
objections
that
were
made
or
as
we
will
contend
were
not
made
in
this
case.
first,
the
testimony
as
to
the
actual
happenings
by
which
the
basis
of
force
or
the
contention
of
force
would
have
to
be
--
be
based.
we'll
take
officer
shannon
who
was
a
highway
patrolman
who
followed
walton
as
he
shot
out
from
the
parking
lot
by
(inaudible)
down
near
palo
alto,
a
very
nice
place
across
the
traffic
into
the
other
of
the
lane
and
the
officers
followed
him,
caught
up
to
him.
well
at
first,
he
raised
--
this
is
of
the
officer's
testimony
is.
officer
dailey
asked
him
if
he
would
submit
to
having
a
sample
of
his
blood
taken
for
a
blood
alcohol.
question
what
did
mr.
walton
say
to
that?
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i'm
reading
from
pages
--
the
testimony
is
at
--
from
--
on
page
8
to
21,
i'm
reading.
and
then
from
36
to
49,
i'm
reading
from
pages
42
and
43
of
the
printed
record.
well
at
first
he
raised
his
right
sleeve
as
though
he
was
going
to
do
it
and
then
he
stopped.
he
says,
“i
don't
want
to.”
then
what
happened?
well,
officer
dailey
kept
asking
him
why
he
didn't
want
a
test
performed
and
i
don't
know
mr.
walton's
exact
words,
but
the
gist
of
it
was
that
he
didn't.
well
then
finally,
he
had
rolled
his
sleeve
back
up
again
and
then
he
refused
again.
he
went
three
or
four
times
and
eventually,
he
stuck
out
his
arm,
he
says
well,
take
it.
then
again,
officer
shannon
testified.
now
mr.
shannon
--
and
this
is
on
cross-examination.
"now
mr.
shannon,
isn't
true
that
at
all
times
mr.
walton
protested
the
taking
of
a
blood
sample?"
answer
"not
at
all
times."
he
seemed
to
(inaudible)
for
a
while
then
he
would
suddenly
got
an
idea,
he
wanted
to
see
somebody,
or
other.
i
forgot
who
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
that
even
still
--
we
would
still
talk
to
him
and
he
would
roll
his
sleeve
up
and
stick
his
arm
out
then
he
would
refuse
again.
i
don't
know
what
the
idea
was.
that's
shannon's
testimony.
then
the
technician
who
was
called
and
he
is
a
duly
licensed
technician
under
the
laws
of
state
of
california
for
taking
blood
samplings
upon
request
licensed
for
that
purpose.
henry
(inaudible),
the
laboratory
technician,
and
i
say
this
took
place
in
the
automobile,
the
accident
investigation
bureau
maintained
by
the
sheriff's
office,
the
district
attorney
and
the
police
of
that
area
for
the
purpose
of
making
examinations.
no
--
no
police
station,
no
anteroom
to
a
jail.
this
was
a
laboratory
which
is
kept
for
that
purpose.
he
wrote
a
question
and
he
request
--
he
was
requested
to
take
a
blood
test
and
he
refused
to
do
that,
didn't
he?
answer
at
first
he
did.
yes
sir.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
this
is
office
--
this
is
the
technician
(inaudible),
from
page
52
of
the
record.
“at
first
he
did.
yes,
sir.”
and
used
--
and
used
a
question,
and
you
stated
that
he
did
consent
to
taking
the
blood
test
after
that?
answer
he
did
consent
to
have
his
blood
sample
taken.
question
now,
up
to
that
time,
his
attitude
had
belligerent
--
been
belligerent,
had
it?
yes,
it
had.
then,
we
go
on
this
testimony
on
page
54.
now
when
the
blood
test
was
taken,
did
mr.
walton
protest?
answer
not
when
his
blood
test
was
taken.
no.
“but
he
did
immediately
before
that?”
answer
he
had
refused
a
couple
of
times
before
he
finally
gave
his
consent
to
having
it.
question
did
any
of
the
officers
threaten
him
in
any
way
about
taking
the
blood
test?
answer
no.
question
did
any
of
the
officers
hold
his
hand
while
the
blood
test
was
taken?
answer
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
question
you
don't
believe
so?
answer
i
generally
take
the
blood
test
myself.
i
generally
put
their
arm
on
the
desk
because
it
is
right
there
and
i
take
the
blood
test.
question
generally,
that
is
true,
what
about
this
time?
answer
i
don't
remember
the
officers
even
touching
him
while
he
was
taking
the
blood.
and
then
we'd
come
to
the
testimony
of
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
--
i
think
so.
usually
going
to
assume
that
or
assume
that
the
officers
were
doing
something
they
shouldn't
do
and
i
think
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
he
would
found
out.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
think
that's
true.
the
officer
would
not.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
think
you'll
find
--
i
don't
know
what
some
police
authorities
they
had
but
they
think
you
would
find
down
there
around
san
jose,
they're
pretty
cherry
about
this
sort
of
thing.
police
officers
have
feelings
although
some
people
may
not
think
so
and
when
they
read
opinions
such
as
are
published
in
the
rochin
case,
they
have
sensibilities.
now,
i
--
i
know
that
from
personal
experience.
they
--
i've
talked
to
them
what
--
we
can't
do
anything
and
that's
their
attitude.
and
they
won't
do
anything
in
a
case
like
this
unless
the
man
--
until
the
man
consents.now,
here's
walton's
testimony.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
walton
comes
near
to
it
as
anyone.
walton
--
and
i'm
reading
from
his
testimony
on
page
82.
now
you
heard
officer
shannon
testified
that
you
protested
giving
blood
from
--
for
the
test
at
first.
answer
that
is
correct.
question
several
times
--
question
and
several
times,
an
officer
shannon
then
testified
you've
finally
consented
to
give
them
the
blood
test.
answer
i
continued
to
protest.
question
what
happened?
answer
the
blood
was
taken
from
me
against
my
will.
question
did
anyone
hold
your
arm?
answer
what
happened,
they
rolled
up
my
left
arm,
the
sleeve
of
my
left
arm,
and
injected
the
needle
and
remove
the
sample
although,
i
continued
to
protest.
“and
you
protested?”
answer
i
did.
afterwards,
i
wanted
some
notation
made
about
my
protest.
and
then
i'm
reading
further
on
in
his
testimony
from
pages
104
and
105.
he
says,
i
was
obliged
to
give
a
sample
of
blood.
question
how
were
you
obliged?
answer
by
telling
that.
and
then
there
is
a
quotation
in
the
record,
“you
had
better
comply
or
else,”
and
that
closes
the
quotation.
and
then
he
adds,
walton,
the
“or
else”
being
implied
so
i
stopped.
the
officer
didn't
say,
you
give
us
your
blood
or
else.
they
asked
him
to
give
his
blood.
he
said
the
“or
else”
was
implied
as
far
as
he
was
concern.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
that
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
correct
except
--
except
when
you
read
the
record
and
see
the
objection
that
was
put
in.
the
court
then,
throughout
those
requested
instructions,
because
they
weren't
responsive
to
any
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
--
i'll
say
it,
you
can
come
to
this
conclusion
and
must
come
to
this
conclusion
that
there
were
no
objection
when
the
evidence
was
offered
in
california
as
in
many
other
states,
the
objection,
for
instance,
to
confessions
which
there
maybe
a
question
of
force.
now,
the
court
itself
will
go
into
the
matter
at
some
time
--
some
time
on
what
we
call
a
voir
dire
examination
and
decide
the
question,
and
that's
the
end
of
it
as
far
as
the
court
is
concerned.
at
other
times,
the
court
will
say,
“we
--
i
will
instruct
the
jury
on
the
point
and
submit
the
matter
to
the
jury.”
then
the
jury
will
decide
it.
but
no
constitutional
point
is
presented
if
the
court
itself
acting
upon
the
objections
before
it
and
the
testimony
before
it
rules
on
the
question.
if
it
ruled
incorrectly,
that
might
be
reviewed
if
there
is
a
proper
objection
made.
but
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
point
i
was
coming
to,
there
is
no
objection.
and
one
--
one
other
fact
i
wanted
to
--
before
i
leave
the
evidence,
walton
was
asked,
“you
stated,
you
--
they
did
not
push
you
around.
you
were
not
manhandled.”
answer
that
is
true.
now
that's
--
now
the
other
facts
before
i
come
to
the
legal
part.
there
was
something
said
about
counsel
and
doctor
being
asked
for
it.
here
are
the
facts
about
his
detention.
you
can
--
we
can
pick
it
up
from
the
record.
i
haven't
the
reference
here
but
i
took
it
up.
the
man
was
arrested
10
o'clock
at
night.
he
reached
the
accident
investigation
bureau
at
10:20
at
san
jose
at
the
normal
time.
in
fact,
that's
a
little
too
fast
to
get
to
that
place,
it's
18
miles,
they
traveled
it
in
20
minutes.
the
technician
came
at
10:40.
they
called
up
the
technician
when
they
arrived.
he
--
he
arrived
at
the
bureau
at
10:40.
and
at
10:55,
the
blood
test
had
been
taken
then
the
man
left.
that's
all.
and
as
far
as
counsel
is
concern,
he
did
make
a
request
to
phone.
i
don't
know
whether
he's
had
counsel
or
not.
that's
--
but
the
significant
part
is
the
discerning
young
man
called
his
bartender
who
came
and
bailed
him
out.
now,
he
didn't
want
counsel.
he
wanted
to
get
out
and
he
called
his
bartender,
the
man
who
--
where
he's
been
spending
the
evening
and
came
with
the
money
and
put
it
up
and
he
got
out.
now,
that's
--
that's
the
terrible
brutal
treatment
that
this
man
received
at
the
office
--
at
the
hands
of
the
officers
of
california.
now,
to
his
objections.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
there
is
no
objection,
then
the
court
below
is
correct.
then
i
will
say
further,
the
--
if
it
was
over
his
objection
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
--
we
are
--
i
think
of
fairly
an
agreement,
that
this
was
not
self-incrimination.
some
members
of
the
court
are
not
in
agreement
on
it,
but
i
think
the
decision
so
far
would
hold
that
this
was
not
self-incrimination.
then
the
rochin
case
was
this
that
brutal
and
terrible
conduct
that
shocks
decency
and
so
forth.
we
have
these
three
propositions
which
we
will
proceed.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
oh
yes,
(inaudible)
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
will
read
it.
i'll
go
through
the
--
or
i'll
go
to
that
one
first.
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
technician,
henry
(inaudible).
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
i'll
read
the
colloquy
here.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
the
exhibit
was
the
blood
and
the
report,
the
sample
and
the
report.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
won't
say
that
there
was
--
i've
got
them
in
order
here,
the
objections,
so
i'll
proceed
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that
was
on
hearsay.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
oh,
let's
see
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
objection
will
be
over
--
yes,
that's
the
one
that
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
say
and
i
have
made
a
notation,
there
was
no
further
objection
or
motion
to
strike.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
there
--
let's
say
the
courts
are
somewhat
selective
on
a
matter
of
that
kind
according
to
the
case.
in
one
case,
they'll
say
he
didn't
make
any
motion
to
strike
and
therefore,
the
objection
on
that
ground
may
not
be
urged.
another
case
will
say
it's
evident
that
the
trial
judge
would
not
permit
him
and
it's
according
to
--
to
what
happened.
that
is,
there's
no
hard
and
fast
rule
on
the
subject.
if
the
court
just
anticipates
your
objection
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
because
the
objection
has
been
made
two
or
three
times
before
and
that's
why
i
wanted
to
go
with
--
go
to
a
(inaudible)
bradford,
who
was
the
director
of
the
laboratory
of
criminalistics.his
testimony
is
on
pages
23
and
24.
he
testifies
that
this
test
was
made
in
his
laboratory
under
his
direction.
my
record
solely
indicates
who
made
the
test.
if
it
wasn't
made
by
me,
it
was
made
under
my
direction.
question
what
percentage
of
alcohol
was
present?
mr.
dimaria,
he
is
the
counsel
for
walton.
“i
object
to
that
question,
your
honor.
it
is
hearsay
on
the
ground
that
he
didn't
make
the
test
himself.
the
court
objection
is
overruled.”
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
it's
the
evidence
of
what
the
blood
showed.
it's
all
been
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
he
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
don't
know
about
down
where
your
practice
but
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
up
--
out
there
in
california
before
a
municipal
judge
who
is
a
higher
salary
justice
of
the
peace,
he
won't
object
it.
he
rules.
he
--
he
--
but
if
you'll
come
back
sir,
if
your
honor
please,
i
want
to
insert
on
the
--
my
grounds,
would
have
any
objections.
sometimes,
they
--
not
permit
you
to
make
a
jury
argument
when
you
make
an
objection.
unfortunately,
sometimes
they
do
permit
you.
what
is
that
for?
but
they
wouldn't
--
the
court
wouldn't
have
objected
to
--
that
the
whole
record
shows
that
the
court
was
not
--
was
treating
him
all
fairly.
then
they
--
then
he
--
then
he
makes
another
motion.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that
has
been
done
by
the
court.
in
re
dixon
was
one
of
my
cases
here.
it
went
back
and
the
california
court
took
--
took
quite
a
little
time
in
coming
to
it,
you've
got
to
ask
them
twice.
and
finally,
they
--
they
rendered
the
decision
and
they
based
it
upon
a
couple
of
adequate
state
grounds
as
i
properly
would.
that
procedure
is
possible,
but
here,
i
don't
think
you
could
get
that
far
because,
first,
you
got
to
get
over
the
hurdle
of
self-incrimination.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
i
--
i
vow
respectfully,
that's
what
i
have
said
in
the
dixon
case.
it
went
back
and
they
found
a
state
ground
and
based
it.
i
think
your
honor
is
absolutely
correct
on
that,
but
i
didn't
want
to
make
a
mistake
with
mr.
justice
harlan
and
somebody
bring
the
dixon
case
out
on
me.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
we
get
used
to
things
after
a
while
a
judge
and
--
we
--
[laughts].
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
[laughs]
we
went
along
on
bradford's
testimony
again.
mr.
--
mr.
dimaria
made
a
motion
to
strike
the
evidence
from
the
record
then,
on
the
ground
that
it
was
hearsay.
no
objection
was
made
at
any
time
what
officer
shannon
testified.
he
identified
the
blood
that
was
taken.
officer
shannon
at
pages
17
and
18
of
the
record,
he
said
the
blood
sample
was
taken
in
my
presence.
was
--
was
it
taken
in
your
presence?
“yes
sir.”
and
they
--
i
offer
it
for
identification
at
this
time,
your
honor,
and
the
objection
was
again
that
it
was
hearsay.
and
it
was
overruled
and
put
it
on
a
game.
the
three
places
in
the
record
that
the
objection
was
made
on
the
ground
that
it
was
hearsay.
now
we
come
to
those
instructions.
as
i
say
the
instruction,
the
refusal
to
give
the
instructions
from
this
case
after
the
evidence
was
admitted
without
qualification
can
raise
no
constitutional
point.
all
it
means
is
that
the
court
decided
the
evidentiary
question
itself
and
did
not
reserve
it
for
submission
to
the
jury
as
it
was
done
in
the
stein
case
and
has
been
done
in
california
cases
as
well.
the
court
was
satisfied
and
it
made
its
ruling.
the
objections,
if
you
would
take
them
and
argue
them
in
a
--
in
a
california
court
or
in
this
court,
the
objection
eight,
a
person
arrested
because
it
appears
that
he
is
intoxicated
has
a
right
to
refuse
to
subject
himself
to
any
at
all
usual
tests.
i
don't
know
what
is
--
object
--
to
any
all
usual
test
and
to
a
blood
test.
well
obviously,
that
is
not
a
correct
exposition
of
the
law.
that's
an
argument
to
a
jury,
but
it's
--
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
legal
objection.
and
then
--
then
--
in
number
9,
if
any
physical
or
other
coercion
frowned
upon
by
due
process
as
implied
in
taking
a
blood
test.
well,
what
--
what
does
that
instruction
mean?
any
other
coercion
frowned
upon
by
due
process.
there's
no
explanation
of
it.
there's
no
--
there's
no
limitation.
what
is
frowned
upon
by
due
process?
(voice
overlap)
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
you
would
have
to
tie
--
it
would
have
to
be
tied
in.
here,
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
if
a
blood
test
is
extracted
of
a
person
arrested
because
it
appears
that
he
is
intoxicated
by
force
and
without
the
consent
and
against
his
protest.
and
the
results
of
such
blood
test
maybe
disregarded
entirely.
now,
if
you're
going
to
raise
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
--
i
was
just
going
to
say
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
if
you're
going
to
assume
that
this
is
self-incrimination,
that
--
that
maybe.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that
would
raise
that.
but
it
wouldn't
raise
the
other
due
process
of
shocking
and
brutal
force.
it
would
not
be
and
that's
the
thing,
self-incrimination,
yes.
that
might
--
might
raise
that.
now,
the
appellate
court,
no
other
objection
was
made
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
i
don't
think
the
record
by
--
i
think
the
record
shows
that
he
was
persuaded
to
give
his
blood.
now
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
he
said
--
but
--
he
says
that.
but
the
officers
who
took
it
say
that
he
didn't
consent.
so
you
have
a
conflict
there.
and
now
here
you
have
--
you
have
a
15-minute
period
of
questioning.
there's
no
force
or
no
manhandling.
now,
if
this
is
going
to
be
self-incrimination,
the
nature
of
the
confession
wrung
from
him
and
you've
got
15
minutes,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
these
four
and
five
hour
cases
that
come
up
here
from
time
to
time?
here,
a
man
in
15
minutes,
“go
on,
let's
have
your
blood
test.
what
are
you
afraid
of?
it
will
prove
you're
innocent.
i
could
--
or
we
will
prove
you're
guilty.
this
is
a
sure
way
for
you
to
get
out
if
you're
not
drunk.
this
is
an
accurate
test.”
that's
the
kind
of
things
that
go
on
in
the
--
in
the
station
house.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well
[laughter],
i'm
glad,
i
can
approve
on
it.
[laughter]
let's
see.
but
that
the
policeman
said,
he
wasn't
manhandled.
there
was
no
show
of
force.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
and
the
court
decided
that.
the
court
decided
that
and
removed
it
from
the
consideration
of
the
jury,
if
you
will.
and
that
does
not
raise
a
constitutional
point.
they
removed
it
from
the
jury.
the
court
has
a
right
to
decide
questions
of
evidence
and
--
or
it
may
be
left
to
a
jury.
but
whether
the
court
does
one
thing
or
the
other
does
not
raise
a
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
what?
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
when
it
admitted
that
the
--
the
testimony
--
when
it
admitted
the
blood
test,
the
court
decided
it.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
by
reading
the
record.
that's
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
of
course,
that
was
not
raised
directly.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
he
admitted
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that
he
admitted
what?
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
he
admitted
it
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
he
didn't
let
the
question
go
to
the
judge
of
whether
it
was
forceful
or
over
the
man's
objection.
he
didn't
let
it
go
the
jury
on
that
point.
he
refused
the
instruction
on
that
point.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
that's
because
he
decided.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
it
could
have
been
either
and
both.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
and
probably
was
both
in
this
--
in
this
type
of
a
case.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
the
--
i
don't
like
to
delve
too
deeply
into
the
judicial
mind.
people
have
gotten
in
trouble
for
that.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
it
wasn't
raise
in
time.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
at
the
end
of
the
case
--
the
end
of
the
case,
for
instance,
now,
let's
--
let's
be
practical
about
it.
supposing
an
objection
had
been
made
when
this
evidence
was
produced,
as
to
the
question
of
consent.
there
were
three
other
officers
present
at
the
time
the
blood
test
was
taken
and
then
an
issue
had
been
raised
on
that,
a
substantial
issue
warranting
a
consideration
of
the
court
during
the
trial.
that
they've
called
in
the
other
officers,
put
them
on
the
witness
stand,
and
have
them
testify
as
to
what
had
happened.
but
he
doesn't
do
that.
he
makes
his
objection
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
after
the
case
is
closed
and
the
court
is
giving
his
instructions
to
the
jury.
they
give
their
instructions
to
the
jury
in
california
after
the
arguments
are
read.
and
they're
going
to
open
the
case
again,
and
say
we're
going
to
consider
this
evidence
over
again.
we
want
to
prosecute
--
we
want
to
rebut
the
implication
that
counsel
now
draws,
attempts
to
draw.
we
want
to
rebut
that
by
introducing
further
evidence.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no,
but
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
he
could
have
done
it
when
the
evidence
is
introduced.
when
the
evidence
is
produced
that
we
offer
this
in
evidence.
the
california
practice
would
suggest
then
that,
if
your
honor
please,
just
a
moment,
we
want
to
examine
the
officers
who
gave
--
who
took
this
blood
test
as
to
the
facts
and
circumstances.
we
want
to
object
on
the
ground
that
this
was
done
by
force.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
oh,
but
--
but
if
the
objection
was
made,
then
the
people
could
have
produced
further
evidence.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
but
the
--
the
objection
three
times
--
twice
previous
to
that
had
been
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
hearsay.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
--
as
--
and
that's
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
the
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
the
judge
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
the
judge
took
the
matter
from
the
jury
on
that
point
and
decided
it
himself
but
he
did
that.
if
he
did
it
in
no
other
way,
he
did
it
by
rejecting
the
instruction.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
as
long
as
he
might
have
done
for
--
for
that
reason,
that's
enough.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
he
asked
the
court
to
give
that
instruction
but
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
136,
i
think
that
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
136.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
duly
qualified
experts
may
give
their
opinions
on
questions
in
controversy
at
the
trial.
to
assist
in
deciding
such
questions,
you
may
consider
the
opinions
with
the
reasons
stated
therefore,
if
any,
by
the
expert
who
gives
the
opinion.
you
are
not
bound
to
accept
the
opinion
of
any
expert
as
conclusive.
that
is
the
usual
instruction
given
on
the
testimony
of
experts.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
we
have
caused
to
be
lodged
with
the
court
the
briefs.
we
were
advised
that
it
was
not
usual
that
the
counsel
had
to
print
the
record.
we
asked
that
the
briefs
be
included
in
the
printed
record
and
we
were
advised
that
that
is
not
usual,
but
that
they
would
be
available
to
the
court.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
they're
here.
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
that
will
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
it
would.
and
i
--
we
have
referred
to
it
some
place
in
our
--
our
brief.
now,
the
rochin
case
to
me
is
our
hurdle,
but
i'll
say
i
think
it's
a
low
hurdle
in
this
particular
--
particular
case.
i'm
not
referring
to
--
i'm
using
that
in
the
athletic.
that
is
the
low
hurdle.
i'm
not
referring
to
the
reasoning
or
anything
in
the
case.
i
want
to
assure
your
honors
of
that
point
when
i
use
unfortunately
that
term
low
hurdle,
but
we
come
to
that
case
and
what
does
--
what
does
the
case
decide?
and
that's
the
point
that
has
been
of
some
--
of
course
we
haven't
had
the
opportunity
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
on
the
rochin
case,
except
as
it
is
expressed
in
the
rochin
case.
we
have
all
kinds
of
opinions
and
i
have
--
had
noticed
at
--
occasioned
to
see
in
california
when
the
counsel
for
the
defense
cites
the
rochin
case,
it
is
--
it
sustains
all
sorts
of
things.
we
hope
that
we
will
get
some
satisfaction
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
case
does
--
we
think
we
know
what
it
means,
the
elements
of
unlawfulness
and
the
acquisition
of
evidence
which
were
present
in
the
rochin
case
were
brutality,
force,
beating,
and
illegal
arrest.
maybe
i
am
doing
even
better
than
judge
frankfurter
did
in
the
case
but
i'll
stop
at
that
point.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
in
the
rochin
case,
i
don't
want
to.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
don't
like
it.
i
am
not
in
the
--
if
i
could
say
something
that
would
be
effective
at
this
point,
within
the
issues
of
this
case
on
that
subject,
i
might
do
it.
but,
i
asked
to
be
relieved
of
that
burden
at
this
time.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
do
not
consider
it
an
accomplishment
but
it's
been
done.
and
i
vow,
bloody
but
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
but
i
just
let
you
in
on
a
secret.
since
the
--
since
they
have
changed
the
rule,
the
supreme
court
has
taken
over
onto
itself
20
cases
involving
searches
and
seizures.
they
say
they
are
not
bound
by
the
fine
--
the
refinements
of
the
federal
rule
and
that
they
will
go
into
this
matter
themselves.
when
they
started,
there
were
four
cases
but
now
they've
got
20
and
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
i
don't
think
they
have
an
enjoyable
session.
the
court
is
divided
as
you
know.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes,
that's
--
but
there
--
there
we
are.
now,
in
the
rochin
case,
if
i
want
to
look
--
if
i
want
to
look
for
the
bases
of
the
rochin
case,
i
assume
that
i
am
entitled
to
look
to
the
precedent
side
of
the
rochin
case.
the
essence
of
the
rochin
case
is
a
reference
to
brown
versus
the
state
of
mississippi.
they
said
that
in
the
rochin
case,
you
can't
do
these
things
and
they've
referred
to
brown
versus
mississippi.
in
brown
versus
mississippi,
brown
was
hanged
by
the
neck
three
times
and
let
down
three
times.he
was
tied
to
a
tree
and
whipped
again
and
again.
the
other
defendants
were
stripped
and
their
backs
were
cut
to
pieces
with
a
leather
strap,
with
buckles
on
it.
they
confessed
but
that
wasn't
enough.
their
beatings
continued
until
they
confessed
to
the
details
asked
by
the
prosecutors.
they
were
arraigned
on
one
day.
counsel
was
appointed
that
day.
the
next
day,
this
trial
started
and
the
third
day,
they
were
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death.
that
was
the
precedent
cited
for
the
rochin
case.
and
in
the
rochin
case,
the
court
here
said,
“there
was
an
illegal
battering
in
the
doors.”
there
was
a
breaking
into
the
premises
illegally
and
illegal
arrest.
the
man
was
grabbed
around
the
throat.
his
mouth
forced
open,
but
he
swallowed
the
capsules,
he
was
taken
incidental
to
a
hospital
strapped
on
a
gurney
and
the
instrument
--
a
tube
thrust
out
his
neck.
a
mixture
cord
down
to
it
which
made
him
--
as
our
late
judge
(inaudible)
said,
come
up
with
the
evidence.
now,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
rochin
case.
now,
this
case
is
as
far
from
that
case,
it
sunrises
from
sunset.
you
have
here
a
legal
arrest.
a
man
was
going
down
the
highway
violating
the
laws,
the
traffic
laws
and
an
immediate
danger
to
the
lives
of
other
people.
he
was
taken
into
custody
legally.
he
was
taken
at
once
to
the
accident
investigation
bureau
and
15
minutes
of
interrogation,
he
consented,
we
believe,
to
his
blood
being
taken.
if
he
didn't
consent,
it
was
taken
without
his
consent.
but
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
yes.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
now,
that's
a
--
but
there
is
none
--
there
are
none
of
the
elements
of
brutality.
there
are
normally
elements
of
brutal
force.
he
--
it
he
wasn't
taken
by
force.
the
most
that
could
be
said
was
a
psychological
coercion.
if
you
could
do
that
in
15
minutes
--
if
the
court
can
conclude
that
that
is
an
overpowering
of
the
man
by
asking
him
for
15
minutes
--
the
questioning
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
since
there's
contradictory
evidence
on
it,
you
must
take
the
evidence
that
he
--
take
the
evidence
as
though
he
did
consent
because
there's
a
conflict,
which
has
been
resolved
against
him.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
the
court,
when
it
admitted
the
evidence
when
it
took
it
away
from
the
jury.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
we
come
back
--
it
will
not
raise
--
it
can't
--
it
cannot
come
up
under
the
question
of
brutality
on
the
rochin
case.
then
it
must
be
under
the
question
of
self-incrimination.
i'd
rely
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
on
that
point.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
no.
no,
it
does
--
it
does
not
unless
you
get
the
question
of
brutality
into
it.
for
instance,
you
could
--
you
could
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
in
sibbach
versus
wilson,
and
he
made
it
very
strongly
that
the
taking
of
blood
or
the
physical
examination
--
let's
say,
the
physical
examination
did
not
raise
a
constitutional
question.
he
believed
that
under
the
rules
that
the
rules
did
not
--
lacking
a
federal
--
acting
an
enactment
of
congress.
it
was
illegal
but
he
said,
it
did
not
present
a
constitutional
issue.
of
course
that
was
a
civil
matter
but
the
self-incrimination,
i
think
this
court
has
decided
that.
now
the
self-incrimination,
the
fingerprints
at
the
state
level,
so
that
justice
frankfurter
won't
worry
about
that
point,
at
the
state
level
the
taking
of
fingerprints
is
self-incrimination,
because
you
identify
the
man
by
connecting
him
up
with
the
murder
weapon.
that's
done
--
that's
done
in
every
state
--
taking
the
accumulations
from
under
his
nails
and
identifying
them
with
the
deceased.
it's
done
privately.
the
hairs
of
the
head
or
the
body
is
done
all
the
time.
the
man,
he's
made
to
put
on
a
set
of
clothes,
but
on
a
hat.
he
is
taken
out
and
he
is
caught.
he's
put
into
an
impression
in
the
sand.
he
is
made
to
put
on
the
shoes
that
were
found.
that's
all.
it
might
be
self-incrimination.
he's
made
to
do
those
things,
but
this
court
has
not
said
that
those
things
were
self-incrimination
as
--
mr.
clarence
a.
linn
well,
there's
a
lot
of
people
in
jail
who
would
want
to
get
out
if
anything
happens
along
that
line.
but
get
back
to
the
rochin
case
due
process.
now,
this
is
what
it
said
in
the
rochin
case,
due
process
empowers
this
court
to
nullify
any
state
law,
and
we
could
say
that
this
is
a
state
law
to
a
certain
extent,
if
its
application
shocks
the
conscience,
offends
a
sense
of
justice
or
runs
counter
to
the
decisions
of
civilized
conduct.
and
then
--
then
anticipating
--
anticipating
a
statement
of
this
was
a
nebulous
sort
of
thing.
this
court
went
on
to
say,
the
state
practices
are
to
be
measured
not
by
our
reason,
speaking
of
the
court,
or
by
the
traditions
of
the
legal
profession,
speaking
of
this
side
of
the
statute,
but
by
the
community
sense
to
fair
play
and
decency
by
the
traditions
and
conscience
of
our
people
or
by
those
canons
of
decency
and
fairness
which
expressed
the
notions
of
justice
of
english
speaking
people.
now
the
taking
of
blood,
when
accomplished
in
a
medically
approved
way,
does
not
smack
of
brutality.
then
remember
the
armed
forces
has
to
submit
to
the
taking
of
blood.
every
person
who
applies
for
a
marriage
license
in
california
is
by
statute
required
to
give
his
blood.
every
pregnant
woman
in
california
is
required
to
submit
to
a
blood
test.
chemical
test
to
determine
the
degree
of
intoxication
in
suspected
driving
cases
were
used
in
45
states
in
1953
generally
without
statute.
four
hundred
and
sixty
four
cities
of
over
10,000
population
use
chemical
test
during
1953.
the
contemporary
american
scene
does
not
regard
the
taking
of
a
simple
blood
test
as
shocking
to
decency
as
brutal,
as
adverse
to
the
traditions
of
the
country.
if
we're
going
to
decide
--
not
there
yet.
if
the
court
is
going
to
decide
that
this
matter
is
repugnant
to
the
taking
of
a
simple
blood
test,
things
that
were
done
by
the
hundreds
everyday
in
this
city
and
other
cities
is
repugnant
to
decency,
then
you
are
deciding
according
to
your
cases
and
not
to
the
taste
of
the
people
because
after
all,
civilization
and
decency
are
things
that
go
throughout
the
country.
now,
was
the
taking
and
use
of
the
blood
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances
related?
did
that
offend
that
fundamental
concept
of
justice?
there
was
no
physical
violence.
there
was
no
psychological
coercion.
there
was
no
illegal
detention.
a
man
was
legally
arrested.
he
was
asked
to
submit
to
a
blood
test
that
would
prove
him
innocent
if
he
hadn't
been
drunk.
