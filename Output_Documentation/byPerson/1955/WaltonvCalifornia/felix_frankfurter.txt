justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
interrupt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
referring
to
instructions,
requested
instruction,
11
on
page
144.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
11,
the
instructions
there
is
to
tell
the
jury
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
as
to
your
point
of
view,
that's
an
instruction,
that's
a
ruling
on
law
based
on
the
finding
that
it
was
without
consent
against
his
protest,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
whether
--
if
it
were
agreed
that
it
was
then
without
the
consent,
attempt
to
struggle,
then
from
your
point
of
view,
the
court
would've
--
would
have
to
instruct
the
jury,
they
would
find
for
the
defendant,
is
that
right?
isn't
that
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
for
the
jury
to
determine
what
is
or
what
isn't
within
the
due
process,
is
it?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
facts
on
which
such
a
ruling
is
to
be
based
and
applied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
wonder
what
--
you
have
to
look
at
the
instructions
specifically
to
see
whether
the
proper
instructions
were
asked
and
refused,
assuming
you're
right
in
your
contention.
first
the
arrest,
(inaudible)
i
suppose
now
that
--
to
review
that,
and
assuming
you
take
yours
under
law,
unless
you
subject
himself
here,
subject
himself
against
this
defense
without
the
application
at
all,
of
course
not
to
make
it
unfair,
i'm
not
implying
mauling
the
man.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
what
is
--
what
is
now
violates
the
due
process.
this
is
a
question
for
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
agree
to
that
for
the
california
law
to
put
what
i
am
inclined
to
say.
so
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
voluntary,
whether
he
subjected
to
it,
whether
he
agreed,
whether
he
resisted,
that's
to
determine
--
that's
the
fact
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
that
isn't
what
he
--
requested
charges
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
if
your
requested
charge
nine
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
--
it
seems
to
be
a
proper
division
of
responsibilities
that
you
caused
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
your
answer
to
justice
clark,
he
admits
the
reach
of
this
evidence
but
never
objected
on
the
ground
that
it's
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
would
be
in
the
record.
i'm
looking
at
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
rearranging
the
points
because
you
weren't
allowed
to
state
the
grounds
of
objecting,
are
you?you
weren't
prevented
from
stating
the
ground
of
objection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
isn't
--
that
would
be
another
ground
of
--
that's
another
offense
of
due
process
clause
than
the
one
you're
urging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
whether
that
issue
was
properly
propounded
to
the
court
at
the
time
it
should
have
been
(inaudible)
the
court
should
rule
on
it
at
the
time
evidence
brings
before
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
your
supreme
court
had
gone
on
the
ground
that
--
i
know
the
case
is
here,
because
(inaudible)
suppose
the
court
or
the
supreme
court
of
california
didn't
go
to
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
--
suppose
they
had
ruled
that
no
timely
objection
was
made
or
if
that
was
the
case
in
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
remove
the
--
remove
the
strike
after
there
was
evidence
on
that
petition.
i
should
suppose
the
state
offered
testimony
but
the
question
(inaudible)
that
is
extracted
from
him
by
force,
we
mean
by
that
without
his
consent
and
overly
submissive
(inaudible)
and
doesn't
have
to
--
it
doesn't
have
to
make
battle
with
(inaudible)
i
suppose
you
then
and
there
(inaudible)
state
a
foundation
that
establishes
that
merely
what
(inaudible)
there
was
nothing
like
that
here,
was
it?
what
you
say
that
when
he
came
to
testify,
they
came
to
suspend.
they
then
brought
out
the
--
when
it
goes
over
his
rejection.
now,
then
(inaudible)
suppose
there
--
there's
a
motion
to
strike
out
as
the
court
has
charged
a
jury
to
disregard
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
referred
from
your
answer
that
you
were
on
--
at
that
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
opinion
by
any
of
your
courts
on
--
on
this
substantive
issue
which
was
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
the
--
is
it
in
the
record
the
issue
that
you've
raised
in
--
before
the
jury
of
a
court
under
your
law?
must
we
state
the
grounds
on
which
you
go
up
in
a
superior
court,
in
a
municipal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
they
--
are
the
grounds
stated
in
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
decisions
in
the
law
of
federal
courts
on
the
--
on
compelling
a
figure,
could
it
be
in
a
prosecution,
in
a
federal
prosecution
compelling
the
defendant
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
extracted
(inaudible)
extracting
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
a
question
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
suggest
--
i
would
suggest,
you're
arguing
the
case
not
on
the
assumption
that
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
as
part
of
the
due
process
clause
is
(inaudible)
you're
not
suggesting
we
shouldn't
argue
it
and
ask
this
court
to
change
the
provisions
on
that
clause.
as
of
now,
i
suggest
we
cannot
argue
this
case
and
hope
to
(inaudible)
so
all
you
have
to
prove
that
there's
self-incrimination,
isn't
that
this
case,
the
hardest
act
you
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
to
do
with
--
is
there
anything
you
can
say
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
assume
that
fingerprinting
is
constitutional
under
your
right.
i
assume
no
reason
for
assuming
that
--
that
in
the
federal
part
at
least.
i
might
say
--
i
think,
frankly,
a
common
practice
doesn't
make
it
--
or
violate
a
constitutional
question.
i
would
have
great
difficulty
in
a
federal
case
not
to
regard
that
as
self-incrimination.
that's
precisely
my
difficulty.
this
is
not
a
self-incrimination
problem
(inaudible)
then
it
goes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'd
say
(inaudible)
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
to
it,
did
you
say
that
that
testimony
implicated
the
--
while
sometimes
he
objected
the
(inaudible)
he
resisted
and
objected
--
he
objected
(inaudible)
and
finally
they
yield
to
persuade
him,
he
--
are
we
to
infer
that
he
is
then
(inaudible)
just
i'm
wrong,
that
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
officers
thought
they
have
a
right
to
take
that
test
whether
he
likes
it
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
officers
had
--
am
i
to
(inaudible)
that
you
think
that
if
he
answered
no,
no,
no,
no
(inaudible)
and
then
taken
(inaudible)
and
persistent
saying,
no,
no,
no,
the
officers
couldn't
make
him
do
the
test.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
why?
am
i
to
infer
from
that?
that
that
is
why
that
an
--
there's
an
assumption
of
the
right
to
do
this
on
the
part
of
police
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
may
i
ask
you
this?
we
have
no
indication
here
from
the
trial
judge
or
from
the
superior
court
of
--
the
status
of
the
denial
from
the
questions
brought
by
the
trial.
we
have
no
indication
that
the
state
of
mind
of
the
trial
judge
on
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
have
no
indication
in
the
superior
court
read
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
affirming
the
conviction.
now,
what
i
should
like
to
ask
you
in
the
light
of
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
brings
you
to
my
question.
i
have
nothing
but
(inaudible)
unexplained
objection,
denial
of
this
(inaudible)
an
unexplained
affirmative
conviction,
that
the
matter
of
california
law
might
be
entitled
to
attribute
to
do
--
to
grant
and
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
on
any
--
on
any
middle
ground
in
the
record
they
justified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
would
i
be
justified
in
saying
for
all
i
know,
this
state
conviction
rest
not
on
the
assumption
and
the
acceptance
of
a
proposition
at
law
that
this
maybe
done
against
the
resistance
of
defendant
as
it
rest
in
this
case
and
the
fact,
this
is
voluntary
and
the
constitutional
questions
overreached.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
clark
why
the
judgment
read
--
why
we
don't
know
on
what
ground
it's
referenced.
i
don't
know
the
purpose
(inaudible)
jurisdiction,
if
you
ask
(inaudible)
we
don't
know
whether
they
based
it
on
state
ground
or
in
federal
ground
(inaudible)
state
ground,
in
federal
ground
and
not
in
the
factual
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me
though
and
i
think
you
have
an
unfortunate
one,
having
counsel
on
both
sides,
people
are
generous
(inaudible)
they
might
even
understand
me.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
say
that
your
present
testimonies
are
better
than
the
police
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
said
here
--
but
on
your
answer
a
minute
ago,
he
admitted
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
only
answer
you've
got
--
you've
got
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
admitted
his
testimony
and
that's
covered
by
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
he
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mind
getting
through
beyond
that,
in
the
rochin
case.
and
subsequently
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
also
approve
of
that?
you
don't
like
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
know
the
supreme
court,
they
rather
--
change
its
mind
of
this
general
claim,
hasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
it
only
means
that
these
cases
coming
here
because
your
supreme
court,
those
making
decisions
and
i
hope
you
would
(inaudible)
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
they're
really
aware
of
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
control
--
the
grounds
there,
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
did
the
district
attorney
or
the
prosecutor
argued
the
question
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
apparently
the
issue
was
argued
before
the
jury.
how
do
we
know
that
it
was
before
the
jury
and
why
aren't
you
entitled
to
state
the
jury
finding
against
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
more
thing,
and
that
the
charges
as
it's
present
was
not
given
because
he
is
open
to
the
judgment
as
the
charge
probably
because
a
certain
(inaudible)
to
the
record,
to
the
evidence
hasn't
gone
forward
and
partly
because
it
embraces
both
questions
of
law
and
questions
of
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
judge
thought
the
case
wasn't
open,
i
suppose
he
would
have
(inaudible)
in
your
court,
he
would
have
shut
off
the
argument
that
you
raise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
there'd
be
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
and
be
allowed
to
prosecute
it
to
meet
this
(inaudible)
and
show
the
issue
of
voluntariness,
whatever
the
charge
(inaudible)
the
issue
wasn't
before
the
jury.
you
would
rather
send
what
the
answer
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
--
and
they
didn't
instruct
--
to
the
contrary
it
isn't
--
they
gave
one
of
the
exact
--
instruct
the
charges
and
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
(inaudible)
that's
true,
isn't
it?
just
gave
a
--
they
didn't
deal
with
this
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
left
it
to
the
counsel
on
both
sides
to
deal
with
it
and
they
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
satisfy
my
curiosity
as
to
why
this
case
shouldn't
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
constitutional
question
(inaudible)
your
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
the
issue
is,
no
matter
what
the
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
not
questioning
it.
i'm
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
surprised
(inaudible)
so
many
cases,
is
that
a
real
constitutional
question
as
i
believe
this
to
be,
the
supreme
court
i
think
may
bring
about.
that's
enough
for
me.
