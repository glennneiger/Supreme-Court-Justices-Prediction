mr.
bowen
yes,
sir.
mr.
bowen
may
it
please
the
court.
i
submit
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
review
this
case
because
it
is
well-settled
doctrine
that
where
the
state
decision
might
have
been
based
upon
non-federal
grounds,
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction.
and
i
say
that
in
this
case
there
were
two
probable,
not
just
possible,
but
probable
state
grounds
in
which
to
sustain
the
state
court
decision.
now,
one
of
those
grounds
is
state
res
judicata.
i
realized
that
the
federal
courts
don't
have
any
such
rule
but
that
does
not
say
that
the
state
can't
have
it.
no
attack
is
made
in
the
brief
of
petitioner
upon
the
state's
rule
of
res
judicata.
it's
been
the
law
of
florida
for
many
years
in
section
79.10
of
the
florida
statutes.
he's
got
it
and
it's
appended
to
his
brief.
and
it
has
been
interpreted
by
our
court
to
mean
what
it
says,
without
a
question.
then,
if
there
were
no
res
judicata
involved,
we
would
still
have
an
alternative
state
ground
which
is
perfectly
valid
and
adequate
and
that
is
to
say
our
court
has
flat-footedly
ruled
as
where
a
person
has
had
a
fair
and
reasonable
opportunity
to
present
the
claims
which
he
now
makes,
and
has
not
done
so,
he
will
not
be
heard
to
present
them
at
this
time.
now,
in
1952,
mr.
durley
had
counsel.
he
went
into
the
circuit
court
of
union
county,
florida,
and
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
as
far
as
we
know,
after
full
consultation
with
mr.
durley,
both
of
them
filed
a
petition,
i
assume.
it's
made
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
prior
assumption
that
they
had
gone
over
his
case
before
that
petition
was
prepared
and
signed
and
filed.
that
petition
contrary
to
mr.
rutledge's
contention,
as
i
construe
it,
is
not
bottomed
upon
the
face
of
the
record
alone,
but
as
i
construe
that
petition,
it
says
that
the
first
count,
there
were
two
separate
information,
before
them
had
three
counts.
it
says
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
second
count
of
the
first
information
alleged
the
same
crime
as
was
charged
in
the
first
count.
that
the
third
count
alleged
the
same
crime
as
was
charged
in
the
second
count
and
in
the
first
count.
then
it
took
the
other
information
and
dealt
with
it,
likewise.
and
in
that
petition,
it
said
that
he
was
being
--
he
had
served
enough
time
whether
you
gain
time
to
make
it
10
years,
that
--
that
two
separate
sentences
of
five
years
each
with
a
maximum
that
it
could
have
lawfully
been
imposed
on
it
because
he
said
he
was
--
he
had
actually
committed
only
one
crime
in
each
case.
and
therefore,
10
years
is
the
maximum.
he
said,
"i
have
served
that,
must
have
been
or
got
better,
gained
time."
he
alleged
also
that
his
right
for
his
--
he
was
united
--
he
was
being
detained
contrary
to
his
united
states
constitutional
rights.
he
didn't
mention
the
fourteenth
amendment.
he
didn't
mention
due
process.
he
didn't
mention
equal
protection
of
the
law.
he
didn't
mention
anything
else
except
contrary
to
the
--
to
the
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution.
a
writ
was
issued
upon
the
basis
of
that
petition.
the
respondent
who
had
the
same
response
as
you
see
here
before
this
court
filed
a
--
a
return
in
which
he
admitted
certain
things,
denied
others,
and
among
the
things
he'd
admitted
was
that
he
had
served
enough
time
to
make
10
years.
it
was
a
gain
in
time
to
do
that.
so,
the
question
was
gradually
before
the
circuit
court,
has
he
--
is
he
being
held
to
serve
multiple
sentences
contrary
to
the
united
states
constitution
or
has
he
not?
the
circuit
court,
after
issuing
that
writ,
heard
the
argument
and
quashed
the
writ
and
remanded
the
petitioner
to
custody,
the
appeal
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
dismissed
his
appeal
upon
the
respondent's
motion.
now,
i
submit
that
in
that
case,
he
raised
exactly
the
same
question
that
he
now
raises
before
this
court
as
to
multiple
punishment.
i
realized
it
is
your
--
mr.
bowen
yes
sir.
mr.
bowen
your
honor,
i
don't
have
the
--
the
record
here
before
me.
i
think
it's
on
--
mr.
bowen
--
page
34.
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
bowen
i
think
it's
on
page
34.
(inaudible)
mr.
bowen
wait
a
minute.
mr.
bowen
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
talking
about
1949.
i'm
talking
about
1952.
the
--
the
later
petition
was
filed
in
1952.
i
believe
that
the
statement
made
by
(inaudible)
and
they're
both
on
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
--
is
in
line
in
that
--
in
that
book
was
co-decided
with
the
approval
by
this
court
in
braniff
airways
against
nebraska
state
board.
i
believe
that
their
statement
to
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
this
court
as
to
what
it
takes
and
--
and
to
respect
particularity
and
definiteness
in
raising
a
federal
question
in
a
--
in
a
state
court
is
in
a
state
of
confusion.
while
the
reading
i've
done
on
the
question,
conventions
mean
that
they're
absolutely
correct
on
that
and
that
this
court
has
--
has
enough
separate
doctrines
and
--
and
inconsistent
and
as
the
law
now
stands,
it
is
a
trifle
uncertain
as
to
how
you
must
go
about
raising
up
the
federal
question
below.
i
know
that
there
are
some
of
the
old
decisions
said
you
had
to
just
put
your
finger
right
squarely
if
you're
on
this
ground
with
the
due
process
clause
in
fourteenth
amendment.
you
had
to
say,
due
process
clause,
fourteenth
amendment,
united
states
constitution.
i
know,
though,
that
in
(inaudible)
it
was
decided
many
years
ago,
this
court,
in
effect,
recognized
that
in
all
instances
that
wasn't
the
exactly
the
law
and
that
it
could
be
done
without
being
quite
so
specific.
i
know
that
in
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
there
are
notable
examples
of
where
they'd
practically
raised
no
federal
question
at
all
so
far
as
--
as
in
--
in
compliance
with
the
old
(inaudible)
is
concerned.
you
take
the
braniff
airways
case.
they
came
up
here
on
a
--
on
a
commerce
clause
question.
they
never
thought
about
fourteenth
amendment
was
parallel.
they
never
mentioned
due
process
clause.
they
relied
on
the
commerce
clause.
but
when
he
got
up
here,
this
court
says
and
that's
where
it
--
and
this
is
where
the
court
cited
in
the
(inaudible)
and
support
of
this
is
its
holding.
this
court
says
they
raised
the
facts.
(inaudible)
says
they
raised
the
facts.
they
set
up
their
facts
showing
that
the
tax
situs
were
not
in
nebraska.
they
say
--
said
it
wasn't.
that,
we
are
not
going
to
be
too
tight
about
whether
they
said
fourteenth
amendment
or
a
due
process,
they
did.
they
have
substantially
raised
the
due
process
question
and
i
think
this
court
proceeded
to
decide
the
question
on
the
due
process
clause.
in
the
gibbs-burke
case,
that
is
equally
far
from
the
--
some
of
the
earlier
cases
decided
by
this
court
in
gibbs
against
burke.
he
came
up
here
and
i
haven't
read
the
record
but
i
have
only
this
court's
opinion
to
go
by.
and
it
--
it
quotes
him
as
having
relied
on
the
original
ten
amendments
from
article
6
of
what
--
of
the
pharmaceutical
guide
of
the
constitution
of
pennsylvania,
of
what?
nobody
from
this
court's
opinion.
it's
just
that
indefinite.
nevertheless,
this
court
just
cast
aside
all
of
its
failure
to
mention
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
due
process
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
said
that
meticulous
insistence
upon
regularity
in
procedural
allegations
is
foreign
to
the
purpose
of
habeas
corpus.
and
so,
the
court
took
that
petition
and
decided
it
on
the
due
--
due
process
clause.
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
says,
if
it's
in
court,
all
in
good
shape.
so,
in
the
light
of
the
brennan's
case
and
gibbs
against
burke,
i
say
that
when
he
filed
this
1952
petition
in
which
he
distinctly
claimed
that
he
has
committed
only
two
crimes,
one
of
each
information,
that
each
of
the
three
types
is
only
the
information
charged
the
same
crime.
and
that
each
of
them
and
the
other
one
charged
the
same
crime.
and
he
wound
up,
he
was
more
particular
than
some
of
these
other
cases
have
been.
he
did
say
that
he's
been
held
contrary
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
i
see
it
in
the
light
of
the
gibbs
case
and
the
brennan's
case,
he
made
a
wonderful
showing
that
he
--
his
federal
constitutional
due
process
rights
have
been
violated
so
far
as
to
put
this
thing
on
the
united
states
constitution
is
concerned.
i
recognize
that
in
gibbs
against
burke,
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
and
that
in
--
in
durley,
this
1952
petition,
he
was.
but
if
the
brennan's
people
were
represented
by
counsel
when
they
were
allowed
on
the
due
process
clause
and
you
--
and
--and
the
court
decided
the
case
on
the
--
on
the
--
i
mean
they
relied
on
the
commerce
clause
and
this
court
decided
the
case
on
the
due
process
clause.
and
i
say
that
in
the
light
of
this
court's
pronouncing
in
gibbs
that
about
the
meticulous
regularity
or
procedural
allegations
thing
foreign
to
habeas
corpus
in
view
of
that
pronouncement,
i'd
say
that
in
spite
the
fact
that
durley
was
represented
by
counsel
in
1952,
that
he
said
adequately
raised
the
same
federal
constitutional
question
which
is
now
before
this
court
with
regard
to
multiplicity
of
punishment.
mr.
bowen
it's
certainly
certain,
your
honor.
now,
it
--
it
is
quite
immaterial
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
here
whether
the
supreme
court
of
florida
based
its
decision
as
to
multiple
punishments
upon
the
res
judicata
theory.
i
want
to
mention
that
res
judicata
just
a
little
bit
more.
mr.
rutledge
doesn't
construe
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
just
like
i
do.
i
got
the
impression
from
his
argument
that
he
feels
that
nothing
is
res
judicata
in
habeas
corpus
in
florida
unless
there
has
been
a
writ
issued
and
testimony
taken
and
then
a
decision.
that
isn't
the
law
of
florida.
i
know
there
are
some
cases
where
that's
occurred.
you
take
state
ex
rel.davis
against
(inaudible)
and
the
state
ex
rel.--
somebody
--
against
prescott
and
some
other
cases.
in
fact,
the
argument,
i
can
find
you
several
where
that
actually
occurred.
the
issue
to
the
writ
took
testimony
and
then
decided
against
him
and
then
the
--
they
--
they
tried
to
forget
about
that
and
run
up
to
the
supreme
court.
that
was
in
the
--
in
the
circuit
court
and
ran
up
to
the
supreme
court
and
said,
"give
me
a
writ
on
this
--
on
the
same
factual
allegations"
and
the
supreme
court
said,
"oh,
no."
it
says,
"you
--
you
have
had
your
day
on
these
facts
there
down
at
low
end.
the
supreme
court
did
point
out
the
issues
of
the
writ
they'd
taken
in
testimony."
but
that
isn't
essential.
if
you
read
moat
against
mayo,
in
82
so.2d,
you'll
find
that
the
rule
goes
just
this
far.
that
if
a
former
petitioner
has
raised
the
same
question
that
is
now
raised
by
the
current
petition
and
that
petition
has
been
denied
even
without
the
issuance
of
a
writ,
no
testimony,
no
writ,
no
nothing
except
denied
the
petition,
that
is
a
bar
of
res
judicata.
they
cited
section
79.10,
if
i'm
not
barely
mistaken,
in
moat
against
mayo.
that's
the
most
recent
pronouncement
of
our
court
on
that
particular
face
of
the
argument.
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
to
the
decision
of
this
court
whether
there
was
any
res
judicata
in
the
mind
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
or
not
because
of
the
corollary
rule
that
if
he
has
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
to
present
the
matter
which
he
now
presents,
the
issues
to
the
question,
he
will
not
be
heard
now,
even
if
he
didn't
present
before.
in
state
ex
rel.johnson
against
mayo,
i
think
it's
in
69
so.2d
--
it
maybe
66--
the
supreme
court
of
florida
later
said
this.
he
said
that
the
petitioner,
it
recounted
the
various
proceedings
the
way
it
had
been
in
court
before
and
then
said
that
petitioner
makes
no
attempt
to
give
any
reason
why
he
did
not
raise
in
the
trial
proceeding
the
question
which
he
raises
here
or
the
question
which
he
raises
here.
under
the
decisions,
therefore,
he
has
waived
the
questions
that
he
now
seeks
to
present.
mr.
bowen
that
state
ex
rel.johnson
against
mayo,
either
66
or
69,
so.2d,
i
think
your
honor
--
or
--
mr.
bowen
a
little
bit
further
on
in
washington
against
mayo,
i
believe
it's
in
75
or
76
so.2d,
our
court
tightened
the
rope
a
little
bit
further,
it
seems
to
me,
because
in
that
case,
they
didn't
say
anything
about
whether
he
gave
an
excuse
or
a
reason
or
not.
i
think
they
must
have
had
in
court,
in
mind,
perhaps,
this
court's
pronouncements
along
the
way
somewhere
when
they
wrote
state
ex
rel.johnson
against
mayo.
then
when
--
when
they
get
on
to
washington
against
mayo,
they
went
still
further
and
said
that
if
he
had
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
in
former
proceedings
to
present
the
questions
now
presented,
he
will
not
be
heard
now.
he's
--
he's
had
his
day
in
court.
he's
had
the
foreign
affair
up
until
then.
i
say
that
mr.
durley
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
in
1952,
when
with
the
assist
of
counsel
who
represented
him
in
every
step
of
the
way,
where
including
the
preparation
and
filing
of
petition
that
herein
imposed
by
circuit
court
and
the
appeal
when
he
had
--
when
he
had
that
assistance
and
preserving
and
knew
every
fact
now
then
that
he
knows
now,
his
1949
petition
that
i
discussed
directly
and
the
1952
petition
showed
that
he
knew
every
fact
in
the
world
that
he
knows
now,
that
he
knew
in
1955
when
this
petition
was
denied.
he
even
attached
the
same
affidavits
back
as
far
as
1949
that
he
attaches
to
his
petition
that
is
now
before
this
court.
so,
he
did
have
a
fair
--
mr.
bowen
that's
how
advanced
your
criminal
law
has
made.
mr.
bowen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bowen
i
realize
that
--
that
they
did
both
things,
your
honor.
but
one
does
not
detract
from
the
other
in
the
least.
now,
they
very
violated
their
own
rule
when
after
having
said
that
he'll
not
be
heard,
they
went
ahead
and
then
just
to
show
him,
that
they
give
him
something
to
convince
him
that
he
was
out
of
court.
maybe
they
went
far
and
they
did
go
further
and
analyzed
the
whole
thing
but
they
didn't
take
back
the
rule.
they
didn't
say
that
they
couldn't
apply
that
rule
to
durley
or
to
everybody
else
and
that
they
wouldn't
apply
it.
they
set
up
two
reasons
in
that
washington
case
why
they
turned
him
down.
one
of
them
was
the
--
that
he'd
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
before
and
two,
on
the
merits.
and
the
fact
that
they
went
into
the
merits
in
no
way
weakens
the
rule
of
law
of
l.a.down
that
he's
out
of
court
on
the
other
ground,
too.
mr.
bowen
i
don't
sure
regard
this.
mr.
bowen
your
honor,
i
do
not
have
a
question
cited
in
my
brief
and
i
do
not
have
a
case
in
mind.
i'll
tell
you
how
these
things
operate
in
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
i
think
the
most
overworked
state
of
the
highest
appellate
court
in
the
nation.
i
tried
--
it
has
--
i
think
it
--
it
has
to
handle
about
1200
to
1300
cases
a
year.
and
every
monday
morning,
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
come
up.
i
think
i
have
handled
95%
of
all
that's
been
there
for
a
good
many
years.
the
first
thing
when
one
comes
into
my
hands
is
to
look
back
and
see
what
is
--
if
he's
got
in
the
form
of
files
that
--
whether
he's
been
in
the
court
before,
see
what
he's
claimed
then.
and
if
he
claims
the
same
things
now,
or
i
see
it
looks
like
he's
had
a
fair
opportunity
to
--
to
claim
it
before,
i
call
that
to
the
supreme
court's
attention
on
monday
morning.
i
--
i
tell
the
court,
if
it
be
true,
i
said
now,
he
raises
the
same
question
in
a
--
in
a
petition
he
filed
here
last
year
or
from
two
years
ago,
whenever
it
was.
and
if
it
be
true,
i
say,
he
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
to
have
raised
those
questions
in
the
former
petition
or
petitions,
sometimes,
we
have
a
lot
of
them
to
come
in
through
the
years
from
the
same
man,
tell
the
court
what
those
--
i
point
those
two
things
out
to
them
and
they
enter
the
--
perhaps
for
many
years
entered
the
same
order
that
they
entered
in
this
case
here
of
denial.
that
is
to
say
the
substance
of
it
is
that
he
--
that
we've
--
that
the
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
being
unlawfully
detained.
now
as
--
mr.
bowen
yes,
sir.
mr.
bowen
--
petition
denial
(inaudible)
judicial
knowledge,
or
whether
that
point
out
to
the
court
that
he
has
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
in
a
previous
petition
to
present
the
question
now
presented
judicially
known
to
the
court.
the
order
is
in
the
same
form.
now,
i
do
not
think
that
this
order
shows
a
decision
on
the
merits.
all
it
does
is
to
say
that
he
has
failed
to
show
probable
cause.
supreme
court
of
florida
takes
judicial
notice
of
its
own
record.
it
said
that
time
and
again
and
that
--
and
then
the
cases
where
they
--
it
shows
the
application
of
that
rule.
now,
supreme
court
of
florida,
in
the
present
case
here,
if
this
order
is
quite
consistent
with
the
disposition
on
the
part
of
that
court,
knowing
as
we
do,
judicially,
that
durley,
(inaudible)
record,
that
he
has
raised
the
same
federal
question
in
1952
that
he
now
seeks
to
raise.
he
hasn't,
in
truth
and
in
fact,
shown
probable
cause
showing
it's
illegal,
was
detained
because
we
know
that
that's
barred
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata.
or
they
could
have
said,
if
they
thought
that
there
was
no
res
judicata,
if
they
thought
that
the
federal
question
had
not
been
raised
in
1952,
they
could
have
said
themselves,
why
we
know,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
knowledge,
that
he
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
in
1952
to
raise
this
question
and
since
he
did
have,
nothing
he
says
here,
shows
any
probable
cause
to
--
to
think
he
ought
to
be
turned
out
mr.
bowen
that
is
the
standard
form
of
order.
i
--
i
--
that
was
my
recollection.
i
checked
it
with
the
clerk
over
the
telephone
sometime
ago.
they've
been
using
that
standard
form
of
order
and
a
denial
for
many
years
with
exception.
i'll
grant
you
that
at
times
--
mr.
bowen
--
like
irvin
against
chapman
and
--
and
washington
against
mayo,
in
state
ex
rel.johnson
against
mayo,
they
had
also
filed
an
order
to
enunciate
some
principle
that
they
think
they
ought
to
take
time
out
from
their
--
from
their
busy
labors
for
writing
opinion
about
and
they
will
deviate
from
that
rule
when
they
want
to
write
an
opinion
but
all
--
in
all
other
cases,
this
is
the
form
of
order
that
is
used
regardless
of
what
i
urge
as
a
reason
for
denial.
so,
there's
nothing
about
the
form
of
this
order
that
says
the
--
they
considered
the
thing
on
the
merits
because
he
certainly
had
not
shown
any
reason
to
think
he'd
been
illegally
detained
if
everything
he
said
was
barred
by
--
and
judicially
known
to
them
to
be
barred
either
by
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
or
by
the
other
doctrine
that
he
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
to
raise
it
before
and
didn't.
now,
he
didn't
attempt
to
bring
himself,
in
this
case,
to
decide
in
1955
down
there.
he
didn't
attempt
to
make
the
slightest
excuse
for
not
having
raised
the
question
in
1952,
if,
in
fact,
he
thought
he
had
not
raised
it.
i
submit
that
he
did
raise
the
federal
question
in
1952.
but
if
he
had
thought
that
he
did
not
raise
it,
he
made
no
effort
to
bring
himself
under
the
johnson
case
by
giving
an
excuse
for
not
having
raised
it.
presumably,
he
had
a
fair
and
adequate
opportunity
because
he
had
counsel
and
knew
everything
then
that
he
knows
now.
to
get
on
to
the
merits
of
the
proposition
of
double
jeopardy
or
double
punishment,
i
point
out
that
in
each
case,
the
trial
court
judged
durley
to
be
guilty
of
the
offense
charged
in
each
count.
there
were
three
counts
in
each
case.
in
case
number
4179
it
would
best
but
nonetheless,
the
first
or
when
he
gets
the
first
sentences
in.
the
judge
sentenced
him
for
your
offense
charged
in
the
first
count.
then
he
sentenced
him
for
your
said
offense
charged
in
the
second
count
to
run
consecutively
with
the
sentence
under
the
first
count.
under
the
third
count,
he
said,
for
--
for
your
said
offense
charged
in
the
third
count.
and
sentenced
--
and
made
that
sentence
run
consecutively
to
the
other
two.
he
did
that
over
--
he
did
that
in
number
4172,
also.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
under
the
circumstances,
that
was
a
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
there
were,
in
truth
and
in
fact,
three
separate
crimes
charged
in
each
information.
now,
under
the
law
of
florida,
it
is
quite
possible
that
under
some
circumstances
quite
permissible
to
allege
several
separate
and
distinct
crimes
in
several
counts
of
an
information.
for
example,
the
(inaudible)
case
that
came
up
from
tampa
charged
four
separate
and
distinct
acts
of
receiving
stolen
property.
they
were
days
apart.
the
information
showed
that.
each
of
the
--
the
several
counts
showed
that
there
were
days
and
sometimes
weeks
apart.
and
yet,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
that
--
that
under
the
circumstances,
that
was
quite
proper
to
not
only
charge
it
that
way
but
to
convict
him
on
each
count
and
to
sentence
him
on
each
count
to
run
consecutively
because
they
were
actually
four
different
crimes.
now,
the
law
of
florida
on
larceny
is
as
mr.
rutledge
just
stated
it
to
you
--
mr.
bowen
yes,
they
were,
but
it's
quite
possible
--
mr.
bowen
--
that
he
committed
those
larcenies
on
the
same
date
from
the
same
(inaudible)
mr.
bowen
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bowen
i
don't
think
you
have
to
presume
it
when
the
court's
record
here
--
mr.
bowen
no,
it
does
not
allege
one
way
or
the
other.
but
the
trial
judge,
after
hearing
the
evidence,
having
heard
the
case
tried,
had
judged
him
guilty
of
and
sentenced
him
for
three
crimes
in
each
case.
mr.
bowen
well
if
he
--
if
he
--
mr.
bowen
--
if
he
did
and
so
adjudged,
why
that's
conclusive.
the
records
can't
be
attacked
cleverly
and
--
and
made
to
say
something
different
to
what
they
do
say.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
bowen
--
that
when
he
judged
him
guilty
of
three
separate
crimes
in
each
case
and
sentenced
him
for
three
separate
crimes,
that
that's
conclusive
and
binding
on
the
one
except
perhaps
on
direct
appeal.
on
direct
appeal,
if
the
evidence
had
gone
to
supreme
court
of
florida
and
if
the
evidence
had
actually
shown
that
that
wasn't
the
case,
that
--
that
there
actually
was
only
one
crime,
they
would
have
reversed
as
they
did
in
the
hearn
case
that
mr.
rutledge
had
cited.
now,
the
hearn
case
is
authority
for
--
for
the
--
for
the
proposition
that
where
several
things,
animals
or
what
not
are
stolen
from
the
same
owner
at
the
same
time
and
place
and
under
the
same
circumstances
that's
one
larceny
and
not
more
than
one.
but,
the
hearn
case
also
recognized
that
if
--
it's
a
different
time
or
different
places
or
under
different
circumstances
that
it's
immaterial
whether
it's
from
the
same
owner
or
not.
they
didn't
say
it
in
--
in
these
words
but
the
case
stands
for
this
proposition
that
it's
immaterial
that
it's
on
the
same
date.
and
so,
with
that
being
the
law
of
florida
and
with
the
trial
judge
having
heard
the
evidence
and
presumably
knowing
what
the
law
of
florida
was,
and
when
he
then
find
adjudged
him
guilty
of
and
sentenced
him
for
six
offenses,
i
submit
that
that
is
sufficient
to
withstand
collateral
attacks
anywhere
on
these
circumstances.
mr.
bowen
i
won't
go
that
far.
i
think
that,
very
likely,
habeas
corpus
would
lie
if
it
would
admit
the
facts
that
he
had
been
sentenced
more
than
one
time
for
the
same
offense.
i'll
give
an
illustration
of
why
i
say
that.
there's
a
case
but
yet,
within
the
last
year
so
i
can't
remember
the
name
where
a
prisoner
had
been
and
i'll
--
first
i'll
say
that
our
law
on
our
statute
on
desertion
and
nonsupport
is
all
ruled
into
one,
desertion
and
--
and
nonsupport,
this
order
as
for
other,
and
it's
all
in
one
statute
and
it's
held
one
fairly
over
one
year.
in
the
first
count,
the
state
charged
him
with
--
with
desertion.
in
the
second
count,
it
charged
him
with
nonsupport
during
the
same
period
as
the
desertion
and
of
the
same
charge.
and
so,
he
applied
for
habeas
corpus
--
he
--
the
judge
sentenced
him
to
--
to
one
year
on
the
first
count,
one
year
on
the
second
count
to
run
consecutively.
after
he
had
served
one
year,
he
applied
to
supreme
court
of
florida
for
habeas
corpus
and
that
court
held
and
properly
so
that
desertion
comprehends
with
it
the
nonsupport,
the
failure
to
support
his
child
and
that
since
he
had
been
sentenced
under
the
first
count
which
embraced
everything
that
was
in
the
second
count
as
--
as
minor
--
as
a
lesser
ingredient
or
as
--
as
if
included
part
of
it.
and
--
and
he
didn't
have
to
serve
one
year
because
one
year
was
the
maximum
provided
by
the
statute.
that
was
the
decision
by
this
court.
and
i'm
inclined
to
believe
that
if
there
were
no
other
impediment
--
if
there
were
no
impediment
in
its
way
on
procedural
grounds,
that
if
he,
who
admitted
the
fact
that
he
had
been
sentenced
more
than
--
to
more
than
one
sentence
for
the
same
offense
that
--
that
he
would
be
heard
and
he
would
be
cut
loose
from
another
sentence.
mr.
bowen
not
on
the
face
of
the
record,
they
never
permit
the
record
to
be
impeded.
mr.
bowen
yes,
but
the
record
of
the
trial
court
which
cannot
be
impeded,
adjudged
him
guilty
of
six
offenses
and
sentenced
him
for
six
offenses
as
i
construe
it.
mr.
bowen
yes
but
matters
that
hold
his
record
cannot
be
used
to
impeach
what
the
record
says.
i
think
that
is
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bowen
sir?
mr.
bowen
you
can
--
you
can
--
mr.
bowen
but,
if
the
record
shows
--
now,
in
that
case,
in
the
case
i'm
just
telling
you
about
the
desertion
and
the
nonsupport,
the
record
did
not
show
that
there
were
--
that
the
matter
had
been
concluded
if
there
actually
were
two
crimes
committed.
the
record
tended
to
show
to
the
contrary
that
there
had
been
only
one
crime
committed
and
he
took
that
position
and
the
state
took
the
same
position
and
brief
the
case
and
--
and
pointed
out
to
the
court
just
what
i've
attempted
to
explain
that
the
record,
if
it
wasn't
an
assault,
it
was
upon
what
the
record
show,
that
the
record
was
entirely
consisted
with
his
claim
and
even
supported
his
claim
that
the
second
count
embraced
only
what
was
charged
in
the
first
count
because
it
charged,
they
were
the
same
children
and
the
same
period
of
time,
and
it
could
not
have
been,
otherwise,
then
he
--
at
least
he
said
he
was
--
he
wasn't
trying
to
impeach
a
record,
he
would
be
going
--
mr.
bowen
to
impeach
a
record?
no,
sir.
coram
nobis
would
not
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
bowen
--
no
other
--
no
other
remedy
will
lie
to
impeach
what
the
record
says,
except
that
on
direct
appeal
is
the
only
way
i
know
of
to
impeach
a
record
surely.
mr.
bowen
well,
this
court
in
heisler
against
state,
treated
a
--
the
question
of
perjured
testimony
of
being
proper
for
coram
nobis
and
i
think
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
bowen
sir?
mr.
bowen
no,
but
the
record
did
not
find
that
there
had
been
no
perjured
testimony.
mr.
bowen
no,
it
does.
mr.
bowen
it
does
and
i
grant
you
that
thing.
mr.
bowen
not
where
--
they're
prepared
on
page
--
i
thought
that
this
court
had
cited
many,
many
times
that
if
the
record
says
that
this
way,
that's
the
way
we
must
deal
with,
i'm
talking
about
the
record
proper,
i'm
not
talking
about
things
not
around
the
edge
and
this
case,
we
have
before
the
court
now,
is
in
the
record
proper
of
the
judgment
in
sentence.
another
thing
that
can
be
attacked
on
coram
nobis
is
where
a
plea
has
been
induced
even
by
fear
of
mode
of
violence
or
by
coercion
or
duress
or
something
of
that
sort,
and
perhaps,
there
are
other
things
too
but
it
is
of
--
i
think
they
were
to
consider
a
claim
by
the
man
--
by
a
man
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time
he
was
tried,
but
i
think
they
had
probably
considered
that
on
coram
nobis.
it
has
a
limited
application
but
it
has
never
been
thought
in
florida
to
--
to
be
permissible
either
on
coram
nobis
or
habeas
corpus
to
contradict
the
record
proper.
mr.
bowen
in
the
mooney
against
holohan
situation,
i
--
i
believe
that
it
would
be
quite
proper
but
there
you
have
no
record
showing
by
the
court
finding
that
it
has
then
no
perjured
testimony.
mr.
bowen
oh,
but
the
jury's
verdict
has
not
file
in
binding
all
the
question
that
so
told
even
in
--
mr.
bowen
sir?
mr.
bowen
(voice
overlap)
it
isn't
a
part
of
--
it
isn't
the
part
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
court
record
which
cannot
be
assailed.
mr.
bowen
i
don't
say
--
i
don't
--
i
can't
think
of
a
court
that
i
believe
would
do
that.
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
of
--
i
don't
know
of
a
court
that
would
that
--
if
it
thought
it'd
have
been
perjured
testimony
would
pass
judgment?
mr.
bowen
well,
either
that
was
made
--
mr.
bowen
your
honor,
i
do
not
--
mr.
bowen
i
--
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
bowen
so
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
record
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial
--
at
the
trial
proceeding.
mr.
bowen
oh,
the
stenographer
--
court
stenographer?
mr.
bowen
probably
was.
the
way
they
work
down
there
is
that
in
permanent
cases,
normally
the
--
the
court
reporter
takes
the
testimony
but
never
transcribed
it
unless
there's
an
appeal.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
appeal
and
i
--
i
may
have
made
inquiry
about
this
--
about
the
thing
one
time
or
another
(inaudible)
over
four
years,
approximately
four
years
before
he
ever
came
to
court
the
first
time
and
if
i
made
inquiry,
i
was
unable
to
get
in
with
record
because
the
--
the
use
--
it's
not
unusual
for
a
court
reporter
after
filing
that
there's
got
--
going
to
be
an
appeal
to
--
those
notes
were
destroyed.
mr.
bowen
that's
all
i
have
to
say
then.
mr.
bowen
yes,
the
--
the
--
their
affidavit
claims
that.
mr.
bowen
i
don't
know
what
the
1949
have
to
do
but
there
is
a
(inaudible)
affidavit
that
came
into
--
placed
somewhere
along
the
way
it
does.
mr.
bowen
they
did.
mr.
bowen
they
did.
mr.
bowen
that's
what
they
claimed
later
on.
mr.
bowen
and
that
and
this
further,
because
the
original
judgment
and
sentence
shows
that
there
were
six
offenses
and
--
mr.
bowen
in
that
--
mr.
bowen
yes
but
it
--
it
said
--
mr.
bowen
i
know
he
might
have
made
a
mistake.
but
he
did
say,
for
your
offense
in
the
first
count,
and
then
later
on
for
your
offense
in
the
second
count
and
to
me
that
means
that
he
has
made
a
record
showing
there
that
there
were
six
offenses.
mr.
bowen
if
he
thought
that
he
made
a
mistake,
but
--
mr.
bowen
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bowen
it
--
it
certainly
--
it
certainly
was
the
only
way
that
i
see
that
that
our
record
showing
can
be
undone
or
circumvented
is
by
direct
appeal.
now,
i
can't
conceive
of
--
of
a
defendant
coming
to
court
on
habeas
corpus
and
say,
"i
didn't
have
a
lawyer
when
i
was
tried,"
i
should
have
had
one
because
of
the
seriousness
of
the
charge
and
my
inability
to
represent
myself
on
the
count
of
being
as
to
what
not
and
attached
to
that
petition
a
certified
copy
of
the
record
of
the
trial
court
which
showed
that
he
did
have
a
lawyer
and
was
represented
through
us.
i
can't
conceive
of
him
being
able
to
--
to
collaterally
dispute
that
record
and
as
such
fashion,
i
don't
think
it's
the
law
even
to
this
court.
i
know
it's
not
the
law
of
florida,
because
if
the
record
prompted
that
is
the
clerk's
men
of
what
transpired
at
the
trial,
they
import
absolute
bearing
and
if
they
say
that
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
he
was
represented
by
counsel
so
far
as
a
collateral
attack
is
concerned.
and
it's
up
to
him
if
those
minutes
are
incorrect,
he
has
a
remedy,
he
had
the
right
to
go
to
the
court
and
show
that
they're
wrong
and
get
an
order
and
correct
him
to
manage.
that's
been
done
in
many
times
in
--
in
our
state.
mr.
bowen
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
but
let's
see
if
we
do.
if
the
judge
had
simply
said
under
the
first
count,
“i'll
give
you
five
years,
second
count,
five
years,
third
count,
five
years
to
all
run
consecutively,
it
might
well
be
argued
that
he
had
not
found
him
guilty
of
the
one
offense
because
frequently,
it's
quite
true
that
the
second
count
was
charged
of
the
same
crime
and
--
and
in
a
different
way
in
order
to
meet
the
proof
as
it
might
come
in
at
the
trial
and
the
third
count
will
--
will
do
likewise
and
so
on.
there's
no
saying
how
many
counts
you
might
have.
but
here,
he
sentenced
him
for
offense
in
--
in
each
count.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bowen
well,
there
--
there's
more
formality
to
it
in
that
but
if
the
court
--
mr.
bowen
actually,
a
judgment
and
sentence
can
be
of
a
varied
brief,
all
that
a
judgment
implied
under
the
statute
is
--
is
adjudication
of
guilt
and
all
in
the
sentence,
of
course,
imposed
a
punishment,
and
it
would
be
quite
sufficient
if
the
record
laid
a
proper
predicate
for
the
judgment
of
sentence.
perhaps,
if
he's
convicted
by
a
jury
or
be
guilty
or
be
quite
enough
if
the
judge
said,
"i
hereby
judge
you
to
be
guilty
as
charged
in
information
and
i
sentence
you
so
and
so."
usually,
although
more
formal,
they
say,
if
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
you
are
--
that
the
court
hereby
judges
you
to
be
guilty
and
so
forth
and
if
the
judgment
in
court
would
sentence
a
law
that
you'd
be
confined
under
state
prison
for
so
much
time
and
things
of
that
sort.
but,
whether
the
court
agrees
with
me
on
this
matter
of
the
merits
or
not,
i
want
to
say
one
go
--
go
back
to
my
original
pieces
for
just
a
moment
to
say
that
despite
the
fact
that
at
least
one
member
of
the
court
points
out
that
in
washington
against
mayo,
the
court
did
apparently
based
its
decision
on
two
points,
one,
that
he'd
had
a
previous
opportunity
and
have
to
bail
himself
off
it,
and
two,
on
the
merits.
despite
that,
they
did
lay
down
the
previous
opportunity
rule
and
they
might
have
and
probably
did
invoke
that
rule
in
this
case
of
dan
durley.
and
they
also
might
well
have
invoked
the
rule
in
--
in
the
johnson
case
that
where
he
deals
no
excuse
for
not
having
raised
it
before,
he's
waived
it
forward
and
it
won't
be
heard
now.
to
--
to
get
along
to
the
--
mr.
bowen
he
had
a
lawyer
--
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record,
i
--
i'm
advised
out
of
the
record
that
he
did
have.
i
--
it
isn't
in
the
record.
it
doesn't
show
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
bowen
no,
sir.
no
and
--
mr.
bowen
no
suggestion
as
i've
ever
run
across
of
inadequate
representation
of
counsel
or
that
he
--
or
anything
about
the
counsel.
i've
never
heard
that
raise
at
anytime
and
that
isn't
before
the
court.
mr.
bowen
the
only
record
we
have
is
the
record
within
this
printed
record
here,
and
it
does
not,
to
my
recollection,
say
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
it
--
it
starts
of
something
like
this,
you
hadn't
been
found
guilty
or
convicted
by
a
jury
--
mr.
bowen
the
court
of
judgment.
mr.
bowen
they
were
probably
were
interested
prior
to
that
time
and
--
and
if
he
was,
as
i
have
been
advised
by
the
man
who
was
counsel
--
solicitor
at
the
time
they
prosecuted
him
was
represented
by
counsel,
why
then
the
record
would
naturally
show
that
to
be
true.
at
least,
to
a
limited
extent,
usually
the
record
says
present
(inaudible)
john
doe,
attorney
for
the
defendant
and
some
--
it's
very
sketchy
showing
but
still
it
--
it
normally
does
show
something
to
that
general
effect.
mr.
bowen
oh,
we
must
assume
that
he
--
that
he
had
a
fair
representation
by
a
counsel
when
he
has
never
briefed,
and
yet,
to
the
contrary,
we
can't
assume
certainly
that
he
wasn't
represented.
mr.
bowen
sir?
mr.
bowen
as
a
matter
of
statute,
he
is
entitled
as
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
if
he
doesn't
have
counsel
and
a
capital
case
and
all
other
cases.
the
courts,
southern
supreme
court
of
florida,
and
i
think
of
--
where
i
can
file
the
trial
court
to
follow
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
if
understand
him
correctly
to
be
that
where
he
is
unable
to
get
his
own
lawyer
and
where
he
is
unable
through
ignorance
or
whatnot
to
adequately
represent
himself
that
he
is
entitled,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
to
have
a
lawyer
furnished
him.
that
is
the
rule,
as
i
understand,
in
florida.
mr.
bowen
if
it
please
the
court,
it
was
before
this
case
was
held,
began
to
come
into
this
court
30
years
ago,
i
--
it's
just
to
come
--
well,
i
-
there
might
have
been
some
or
in
most
of
them
have
been
since
then,
it
were
just
a
common
practice
in
the
court
for
our
practice
for--
if
a
defendant
didn't
have
and
i'm
--
couldn't
get
his
own
lawyer
charged
him
with
a
serious
crime
for
the
court
to
reach
out
and
grab
a
lawyer
fraction
to
that
bar
and
said,
"now
you
come
in
here
and
represent
this
man,
just
as
a
matter
of
course."
now
i
grant
you
that
all
judges
don't
have
the
same
due
of
what's
right
in
pleading
as
--
that
most
of
them
do
and
it
could
well
be
that
a
--
that
there'd
be
an
isolated
instance
of
a
judge
that
wouldn't
give
a
man
counsel
when
he
is
entitled
to
another
constitution.
you
might
recall
the
wade
mill
case
for
trying
to
reach
this
court
a
few
years
ago
from
--
from
florida
county.
if
i
recall
right,
the
wade
mill
case
was
bought
them
squarely
upon
the
proposition
that
a
boy,
age
of
18
years
old,
charged
with
a
serious
crime,
unable
to
represent
himself
because
of
the
ignorance
the
man
experienced
was
entitled
constitutionally
towards
--
to
counsel.
i
think
this
court
so
held
and
it's
held
that
in
many
other
cases
too.
and
by
and
large,
that's
the
rule
they
supplied
in
florida
and
if
it
wasn't
applied,
and
it
was
shown
to
supreme
court
of
florida
that
it
should
have
been
implied,
they
would
see
that
it
was
applied.
mr.
bowen
no.
no,
it
isn't
--
it
is
an
ironclad
rule.
mr.
bowen
there
are
certain
cases,
if
for
instance,
it'd
come
under
the
betts-brady
rule
where
defendant
is
tried
by
the
judge
without
a
jury
upon
a
waiver
of
--
of
jury
trial
where
the
judge
doesn't
feel
that
it's
necessary
to
appoint
counsel
because
it's
his
firm
intention
to
see
that
it
is
right
to
safeguard
it
all
the
way
along.
and
in
a
case
of
that
sort,
sometimes
a
judge
will
not
appoint
counsel
even
if
the
man
requested.
mr.
bowen
may
it
please,
your
honor.
in
dave
county,
where
miami
is
situated,
i
--
there's
a
criminal
court
of
record
in
the
court
of
crimes
in
the
circuit
court
--
circuit
court
capital
cases
for
the
crime
of
misdemeanors,
criminal
court
of
record
all
furnished
up
to
capital.
and
i
have
been
told
by
a
counsel
practicing
before
that
court
that
around
95%
of
the
defendants
waive
trial
by
jury,
that's
before
judge
ben
c.willard
in
miami.
now
in
jacksonville,
the
situation
is
not
that
way.
there
are
reasons
why
they
do
waive
their
counsel.
the
record
goes
by
and
when
they
have
counsel,
they've
been
these
many
times
advised
them
that
has
waived
trial
here.
that
we
--
we
---
we're
better
off
if
we
do
in
--
in
all
respects,
whatever
he
does
tell
him.
over
in
jacksonville,
now
they
don't
have
but
--
they
don't
have
but
one
criminal
court
of
record
to
try
the
hundreds
of
cases
that
come
before
that
court
every
year.
just
literally
hundreds
of
them
and
judge
willard
can
try
a
lot
of
them
in
--
in
pretty
short
order
because
he's
used
to
--
to
the
things
that
are
important
and
he
doesn't
waste
all
day
(inaudible)
but
over
in
jacksonville
where
they
have
a
lesser
population,
considerably
less,
i
think
they'd
counted
and
got
about
703,000
according
to
a
recent
federal
census,
special
census.
duval
county
maybe
300,000,
approximately,
350,000,
i
don't
know
exactly,
half
or
less
in
population.
they
have
a
--
a
situation
there.
it's
true,
they
don't
have
a
court
of
crimes
and
they
have
misdemeanors
too,
but
they
found
it
necessary
to
install
another
court
there
recently
with
the
same
jurisdiction
as
the
criminal
court
of
record
because
they
didn't
waive
the
jury
trials
there
like
they
did
in
dade
county
and
they
--
and
it
just
takes
time
and
more
time
to
try
jury
cases
much
more
than
it
does
to
try
a
case
without
a
jury.
it's
--
mr.
bowen
sir?
mr.
bowen
well
--
mr.
bowen
not
--
not
as
in
miami.
mr.
bowen
they
do
waive
occasionally
all
over
the
state.
mr.
bowen
all
over
the
state
and
every
court,
did
i
know
anything
about
they
do.
mr.
bowen
no,
sir,
not
predominantly.
there
is
a
--
is
a
reason.
i
don't
--
i
can't
--
i
don't
want
to
be
unfair
to
anyone
but
i
have
been
told
by
lawyers
in
miami
that
they
prefer
to
try
cases
without
a
jury
before
judge
willard
and
recommend
to
their
clients
that
they
do
so
for
several
reasons.
one,
it
expedites
the
case
and
gets
over
with
and
they
have
--
they
said
they
haven't
anchored
up
to
--
to
prevent
a
case
but
it
does
get
it
over
with.
and
second,
they
tell
me
that
their
experience
has
taught
them
that
judge
willard
will
give
them
breaks
if
there's
any
to
be
had
from
the
case
made
that
a
jury
might,
probably
wouldn't
give
him.
in
other
words,
he
--
he
is
inclined
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
doubts
that
they
tell
me
a
jury
might
not
give
them.
and
i
--
i've
been
told
that
that
is,
perhaps,
a
major
reason
that
they
prefer
to
try
him
before
judge
willard.
that
he
convicts
a
lot
of
people
now.
the
three
records
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
shows
that
he
does.
but
they
--
they've
told
me
that
that's
a
--
a
major
reason
why
they
do
waive
so
much.
but
as
i
say,
all
over
state,
here
and
there,
you'll
find
they're
waiving
the
jury
and
--
and
trying
a
case
before
the
judge,
some
--
some
counties
more
than
others.
but
none
of
them
that
reached
the
proportions
that
was
obtained
in
dade
county.
mr.
bowen
no,
sir.
i
don't
at
all.
i
think
that
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
three
separate
larcenies
in
each
case
as
the
trial
judge
found
any
judgment
in
sentence
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
unusual.
nothing
--
nothing
cruel
and
unusual
certainly,
because
under
the
law
of
florida,
each
larceny
of
cattle
is
subject
to
be
punished
by
imprisonment
for
five
years.
and
it
--
it
was
just
--
it
was
--
now
why
--
i
don't
suppose
i'm
at
liberty
to
tell
you
why.
i
know
--
know
things
outside
the
record
as
only
why
i
think
that
the
--
that
much
sentence
was
imposed
in
this
case.
but
certain
it
is
that
there's
nothing
unlawful
about
it.
there'
nothing
cruel
or
unusual
about
giving
to
pay
or
giving
a
man
a
five-year
sentence
for
each
separate
and
distinct
offense
of
larceny
of
cattle.
i
have
known
of
innumerable
instances
where
a
lessee
was
just
charged
in
stealing
one
cow
or
one
calf.
that
he
got
five
years.
and
if
he
committed
six
crimes,
he's
certainly
subject
to
being
sentenced
six
times
for
those
six
thefts,
five
years
apiece.
as
i
understand
the
rule
that
this
court
has
laid
down
in
louisiana
against
resweber,
the
current
and
unusual
punishment
doctrine
applies
to
the
method
of
punishment.
and
here,
i
point
out
that
he
has
no
method
of
punishment
imposed
on
him,
that's
the
slightest
bit
different
from
anybody
else.
that
it
is
better
to
him
being
50
years
old
or
whatever
the
--
the
record
shows
him
to
be.
it
is,
as
i
see
it,
totally
unimportant.
a
--
a
50-year
old
man
or
whatever
his
age
is,
is
just
as
guilty
of
stealing
cows
if
he
--
if
he
steals
them
as
a
20-year
old
man
is,
and
he
started
to
exactly
the
same
point
but
he
knew
how
old
he
was
when
he
stole
them
if
he
stole
them.
mr.
bowen
well,
it
--
it
may
amount
to
that.
it's
up
to
--
up
to
mr.
rutledge
in
--
mr.
bowen
well,
it
might
--
it
might
lead
us
down
a
blind
trail
that
there
is
no
benefit
to
anybody.
mr.
bowen
if
his
allegation
is
true
and
if
they
can
be
heard
despite
the
procedural
objections
and
if
they
are
not
barred
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
record
of
the
trial
court,
then
the
maximum
was
ten
years.
mr.
bowen
he
served
that.
he
had
served
that
back
in
1952
and
he
so
alleged
when
he
filed
that
1952
petition
and
we
admitted
it
in
our
--
mr.
bowen
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
bowen
in
--
it
was
the
benefit
of
gaining
time,
a
prisoner
gets
out,
after
the
first
four
years,
he
gets
15
days
a
month
off
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
exactly
how
long
or
time
they
would
take
to
serve
30
years,
but
i
would
suggest
probably
16
years
and
some
days
or
months.
the
first
year,
he
gets
five
days
--
first
and
second
years,
he
gets
five
days
off
for
good
behavior.
the
third
and
fourth
years,
he
gets
ten
days
off
and
after
that
he
gets
15
days
off.
mr.
bowen
oh
he
would
have
been
--
he
would
have
had
10
years
with
the
benefit
of
good
behavior
that
he
had
earned
and
we
conceded
in
1952.
he
--
he
had
already
made
10
years.
mr.
bowen
i
do
submit
most
earnestly
that
he'd
had
a
day
in
court.
mr.
bowen
i'd
say
at
the
present
time
that
i
know
of
no
remedy
that
he
has.
mr.
bowen
well,
it
is
--
it
is
different
and
it
--
it
hadn't
been
different,
this
court
would
now
grant
a
certiorari,
i
take
it.
it
is
a
different
situation
from
the
average
case.
it
comes
to
the
appeal
on
petition
for
certiorari.
no
doubt
of
that,
but
the
--
if
he
has
remedy
today,
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
mr.
bowen
but
that
is
a
legal
remedy,
as
distinguished
from
clemency
that's
a
pardonable
act.
mr.
bowen
if
he
--
if
the
--
if
he'd
taken
it
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
direct
appeal
with
the
testimony
and
claimed
at
that
time
that
there
actually
were
only
two
crimes
committed
instead
of
six
and
the
record
had
so
revealed,
i
have
to
say
the
supreme
court
of
florida
would
have
reversed.
mr.
bowen
i
don't
know
what
the
record
would
have
shown,
sir.
i
--
i
really
don't.
i
--
i
have
--i
have
never
had
the
benefit
of
examining
the
record
because
as
i
said,
i
don't
think
anyone
was
ever
prepared.
mr.
bowen
i'm
not
certain
that
i
understand
that.
mr.
bowen
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
bowen
then
he
would
have
had
relief
--
mr.
bowen
--
at
the
hands
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
i
--
i
don't
know
actually
what
the
record
would
--
mr.
bowen
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
so
decided
in
the
face
of
the
trial
court's
finding
that
he
committed
six
crimes.
mr.
bowen
i
do
not
know
of
my
knowledge
whether
the
--
whether
it's
one
way
or
the
other.
do
i
have
any
time
left
to
argue
a
--
a
perjured
testimony?
