justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
before
you
move
over
to
that,
i'd
like
to
this
question
to
you.
i
think
this
case
opens
up
broader
problems
in
the
immediate
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
by
that
is
this.
are
you
in
a
position
to
tell
the
court
whether
the
government
in
the
district
here,
take
any
steps
to
investigate
the
(inaudible)
from
the
background
of
--
of
people
who
are
silent
to
grand
jury's
meetings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
mean
by
a
broader
question
in
going
on
my
own
experience
in
being
long
ago,
very
long
ago.
it
was
a
common
practice
of
the
government's
procedure.
i
thought
then
as
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
now
after
all
but
i
now
see
it
in
this
advice.
the
government
took
steps,
scrupulous
steps
by
the
most
scrupulous
district
attorneys
to
find
out
what
kind
of
people
get
on
the
grand
jury.
i
think
this
question
of
defending
counsel
jury
is,
is
related
to
that
problem
which
i
think
we
have
to
have
in
this
case,
if
it
(inaudible)
scrupulous
because
the
--
you
may
--
you
may
affect
before
the
impact
on
the
grand
jury's
business.
they
discussed
this
that
vested
powers
of
incident
influence
unintended
it
by
going
around
it
and
has
been
shopkeepers
and
whatnot,
what
kind
of
a
fellow
is
chosen
as
you
think
from
the
legal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
may
appear
between
government
and
--
and
some
(inaudible)
i
think
that
--
i
don't
know
if
the
government
would
shed
--
would
give
us
some
light
on
this
subject,
but
i
think
you
can't
discuss
something
about
that,
consider
this
case
without
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
control
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
all
i'm
(inaudible)
wouldn't
call
upon,
deal
with
that
problem.
all
i'm
saying
is,
is
this
the
issues
isn't,
fairly
put
it,
the
--
the
influence,
deleterious,
potentially
deleterious
and
consciously
unintended
influence
on
the
working
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
role
that
the
grand
jury
method
terribly
played
in
(inaudible)
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
district.
i
do
not
think
to
myself
it
has
--
deriving
--
consider
one
problem
with
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
gives
us
trouble,
the
questions
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
because
the
court
let's
say
maybe
right
that
he
--
the
lawyer
is
not
in
office,
they
called
office
in
determining
that
statute.
it's
non
constat
that
--
that
congress
couldn't
constitutionally
include
him
amongst
officers
and
take
him
out
of
the
restrictions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
what
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thoron,
may
i
ask
you
this
further
question
about
practice
in
this
way.
is
there
a
recognized
procedure
or
practice,
i
don't
mean
formulated
or
--
or
set
down
in
words
of
some
(inaudible)
course
for
this
error
recognized
(inaudible)
by
this
counsel
for
defendant
and
had
asked
the
court
automatically
as
to
the
relevance
just
like
this
in
the
grand
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
they're
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
withdraw
that.
is
there
a
mode
by
which
a
relevant
question,
any
questions
can
be
relevant?
assume
the
complexion
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
search
the
--
to
search
the
scope
of
bias
in
so
far
as
this
court
had
rest
it
open
as
something
that
could
be
searched.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
speaking
of
presenting
jurisdiction.
is
there
a
by
which
counsel
can
come
before
judge,
chief
judge
laws
or
any
of
the
other
judges,
district
judges
says,
“i'm
counsel
for
so
and
so,
who
--
it
is
no
secret.”
it's
under
investigation
and
may
i
act
upon
it
to
take
appropriate
test
to
ascertain
specifically
16
indicated
jurors
whether
they
do
not
come
under
the
rule
against
bias
with
intervention
of
the
--
the
supreme
court,
would
disqualify
them
from
bringing
in
an
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thoron,
the
questions
i've
put
to
you
do
not
look
through
and
certainly,
do
not
mean
to
indicate
what
i
think
about
this
particular
commitment
to
contempt.
i'm
speaking
beyond
that,
whatever
this
court
may
be
arising
or
somebody
would
be
arising
dealing
with
this
problem,
but
he
said
what
it
is
said
and
what
isn't
said
and
what
is
to
be
controlled,
and
taking
for
granted
are
not
to
be
taken
for
granted
as
to
the
orderly
procedure
in
dealing
with
what
concededly,
i
suppose
consistently,
is
not
an
easy
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
would
like
to
be
shed
on
in
reply
to
the
questions
i've
put
to
you
by
another
memorandum
if
that's
okay,
to
be
able
to
inquire
(inaudible)
clean
understanding,
your
brother
in
the
position
of
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
excuse
me.
may
i
ask
you
this.
how
could
you
say
that
case
where
a
lawyer
engages
in
a
crime
in
a
trial
that
would
likely
to
last
in
fact
--
well,
has
lasted
for
a
week
or
so.
it's
likely
to
last
several
weeks
(inaudible)
and
the
lawyer
was
actually
conducting
the
case,
some
half
an
hour
before
(inaudible)
after
a
time
fixed
for
the
trial
of
debate
there
today?
what
would
you
do
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
comes
clearly
at
the
first
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
go
through
the
legislative
history
of
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
come
in
because
of
that
business
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
statute
as
a
district
--
the
one
before
that,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
is
that
(inaudible)
with
the
one
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
innocently
read
it
without
having
a
case
or
a
problem,
you
wouldn't
think
there
would
be
another
involved,
officer
of
the
court
who
has
misconduct,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that's
because
you
have
official
purpose
in
exerting
a
sense
of
moral
responsibility.
but
just
reading
into
congress,
congress
passing
a
statute
to
officers
of
the
court
in
their
official
capacity,
it's
highly
descriptive
of
the
lawyer
to
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
any
sense
--
i
mean
talk
about
interpreting
the
meaning
of
what
congress
did
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sponsored
it
for
a
very
different
reason,
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
first
circuit
passed
on
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
think
it
tell
us
how
they
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
pass
on
the
question
whether
the
