what
judge
did
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
difficulty
of
drawing
the
line
--
do
you
think
gets
--
should
have
anything
to
do
with
determining
whether
the
court
does
have
that
power?
in
other
words,
the
criminal
offense
--
i
should
suppose
that
one
of
the
basic
principles
is
that
a
man
ought
to
know
whether
he's
--
he's
convicted
for
the
conduct
before
he
did
the
crime.
how
could
a
man
know
here
what
judge
(inaudible)
and
the
others
as
they
were?
maybe
they
even
succeeded
if
this
was
--
in
minds
of
some,
not
a
crime,
but
i
think
it
is
if
it's
--
and
it's
all
those
crimes,
but
let's
suppose
--
let's
put
in
some
other
category.
justice
hugo
l.

it
is
necessary
that
they
--
at
least
certain
enough
so
that
the
man
wouldn't
be
put
in
jail
or
fined
or
that
knowledge
is
a
conduct
of
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
i'm
looking
at
the
--
have
you
found
any
cases
where
a
person
is
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
by
the
finding
by
the
court
that
he
had
no
guilty
presence
and
that
he
acted
in
good
faith?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
that.
i
--
i
just
wondered
if
in
looking
at
it
because
that
occurs
to
be
a
view.
they
have
--
have
there
been
any
conviction
of
people
for
contempt,
a
criminal
contempt
with
fines
that
deals
on
--
and
that
was
on
the
basis
of
conduct
which
was
not
precisely
forbidden
anywhere
and
which
the
judge
--
which
was
found
to
have
been
done
in
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'll
look
at
it.
i'm
just
--
i'm
just
asking
that
because
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
in
connection
with
an
act
that
it's
precisely
forbidden.
what
i
was
asking
was
a
conduct
that
is
not
precisely
forbidden
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
statute
or
any
--
