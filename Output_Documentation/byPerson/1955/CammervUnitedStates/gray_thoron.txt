mr.
gray
thoron
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner's
argument
has
stressed
petitioner's
duty
to
his
client.
and
has
found
much
more
comfort
in
the
precedence
in
the
emspak
and
weinberg
cases
when
we
find
or
actually
warranted
when
those
cases
were
examined.
well,
what
petitioner
has
wisely
ignored
in
his
presentation
is
the
impact
of
his
conduct
on
the
grand
juror.
he
largely
ignores
what
we
find
to
be
the
controlling
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
power
of
the
judiciary
to
prevent
behavior
on
the
part
of
a
lawyer,
when
that
lawyer
is
representing
an
indicted
client
as
counsel
of
reckon,
when
that
behavior
tends
to
interfere
and
harass
an
active
arm
of
the
court
in
the
administration
of
justice,
in
this
case,
the
grand
jury.
we
don't
charge
any
intent
to
actually
influence
them
with
respect
to
proceedings
against
mr.
cammer.
it's
the
tendency
of
this
action
to
interfere
and
harass
with
the
grand
jury,
a
functioning
grand
jury,
a
sitting
grand
jury,
which
is
what
the
contempt
confession
is
aimed
at
preventing.
it's
aimed
primarily
at
preventing
future
repetitions
of
this
conduct.
the
court
recognized
that
mr.
cammer,
the
petitioner,
was
presumably
acting
in
good
faith.
they
didn't
question
the
fact
that
he
felt
that
he
should
had
a
right
to
behave
from
the
way
he
did
and
make
the
direct
approach
that
he
did,
but
it
recognized
that
this
conduct
had
a
big
potential
impact
on
the
grand
jury,
and
that's
what
this
case
is
essentially
about.
i
could
state
the
question
i
believe
fairly
simply
as
follows,
whether
the
judiciary
has
the
power
to
protect
and
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury
system,
when
the
lawyer
threatens
the
integrity
of
that
system
by
communicating
private
on
behalf
of
an
indicted
client
with
members
of
a
sitting
grand
jury
who
are
still
investigating
the
same
kind
of
conduct
for
which
they
indicted
as
client
without
first
notifying
the
court
or
receiving
its
permission.
if
the
court
in
its
discretion
as
judge
kirkland
did
felt
that
a
direct
communication
was
the
appropriate
way
to
try
to
develop
bias,
that's
one
thing,
but
the
court
should
be
consulted,
should
be
asked
as
to
what'll
be
done.
if
this
conduct
is
proper
in
this
kind
of
case,
it's
proper
in
all
cases.
now,
petitioner's
argument
falls
essentially
as
we
see
it
under
two
heads.
mr.
gray
thoron
we
--
mr.
gray
thoron
we
--
we
believe
that
cause
when
judge
kirkland
and
his
remarks
set
forth
verbatim
in
the
record
and
in
the
briefs
when
he
said
specifically,
“you
may
ask
the
jurors
about
the
one
subject
of
personal
bias
to
this
defendant
who
may
have
indicted.
he
never
contemplated
that
they
would
be
approached
with
broad
questionnaires
such
as
set
forth
on
pages
46,
the
actual
questionnaire
here.
he
may
have
opened
the
door
in
a
specific
case
to
a
now
interrogatory.
we
believe
that
once
we
see
what
develops
here,
it
would
have
been
far
better
to
hold
the
interrogatory
if
proper.
we're
not
at
all
sure
that
such
interrogatories
were
proper.
it's
an
open
question
which
this
court
did
not
decide
in
the
quinn
case.
it
was
briefed
as
to
whether
a
hearing
should
be
heard
on
the
--
whether
there
was
a
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
bias
that
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
reach
that
specific
question.
our
objection
here
--
mr.
gray
thoron
if
the
court
gives
it
permission,
whether
we
think
the
court
is
in
error
in
giving
the
permission,
of
course
it
will
be
professionally
proper.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
can't
conceive
of
any
lawyer
being
held
guilty
for
contempt
when
he
has
asked
the
court's
permission
when
in
doubt
as
to
the
proprieties
of
a
particular
action.
and
the
--
the
court
says,
“i
think
it's
proper
for
you
to
go
ahead.”
the
court
may
be
mistaken.
maybe
the
court
didn't
consider
the
potentialities
of
what
might
develop
from,
but
i
can't
conceive
of
that
being
contempt
once
the
court
has
indicated
to
adopt
the
lawyer
the
way
he
should
precede.
we
don't
believe
in
this
case
that
the
--
the
specific
request
that
was
--
judge
kirkland's
specific
words
in
this
case
constituted
a
blanket
endorsement
to
all
the
bar
where
the
course
of
the
proprietors
has
always
been
you
do
not
contact
sitting
jurors,
whether
they
are
grand
jurors
or
whether
they
are
petty
juror.
that's
a
matter
of
general
propriety.
it's
not
written
into
the
statutes
particularly
if
you
contact
them
to
influence
them
to.
that
is
made
a
criminal
offense
by
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
don't
believe
that
judge
kirkland
having
once
made
the
ruling
would
change
his
ruling,
unless
new
facts
were
brought
to
his
attention
that
convict
--
convince
him
he
was
wrong.
it
seems
to
me
that
another,
judge
laws
who
felt
this
procedure
was
improper
would
not
be
bound
by
the
ruling
of
a
fellow
judge
in
a
particular
case
which
was
far
more
narrow
the
permission
which
was
granted
there
than
what
was
done
here.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
specific
judge,
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
lawyer
has
to
follow
the
instructions
of
a
particular
court
that
he
is
before.
now,
when
one
judge
--
of
course,
if
he
limited
himself
to
the
one
question
of
direct
personal
bias
against
this
man,
gold,
do
you
have
any
specific
enmity,
personal
bias
against
gold?
that
would
have
--
we
think
it
would
have
been
far
better.
in
fact,
we
would
say
it
was
an
impropriety
to
make
that
direct
approach.
i
doubt
if
he
would
be
held
in
contempt
on
the
basis
of
his
precedence,
but
when
he
goes
beyond
that
and
we
believe
that
--
and
when
this
--
this
conduct
has
potentiality
of
it,
that
it's
not
at
all
improper
for
the
court
to
adjudicate
it
as
being
misbehavior
by
an
officer
of
the
court
in
official
transaction.
i
have
to
discuss
whether
this
is
an
official
transaction.
that's
the
knotty
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
gray
thoron
it
certainly
does,
your
honor.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
have
no
knowledge
on
that
as
to
that.
i
have
no
--
no
knowledge
whatsoever
what
the
grand
jury
practice
is
in
this
particular.
mr.
gray
thoron
we'd
be
glad
if
we
--
mr.
gray
thoron
we'd
be
--
mr.
gray
thoron
we'd
be
--
we'd
be
glad
to
look
into,
to
make
inquiries
as
to
what
the
practice
has
been
and
submit
a
memorandum
if
the
court
would
find
it
helpful
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
it
--
that
it's
not
really
necessary
to
reach
that
problem
in
this
specific
case.
the
--
the
problem
is
--
i'd
like
to
know
myself
what
the
--
what
the
answer
to
that
is
--
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
indiscriminate
opportuning
and
propaganda
directed
at
sitting
grand
jurors
has
a
greater
potentiality
for
harm
than
making
inquiries.
although,
those
inquiries
depends
how
they're
done
or
what
they
have
done.
it
--
it's
a
matter
of
degree
but
it
seems
to
me
this
is
more
direct.
mr.
gray
thoron
all
this
borderline
where
--
where
to
draw
the
line
is
a
troublesome
question.
i
don't
know
that
every
judge
would
agree
as
to
what
is
--
what
is
appropriate
there.
i
think
it
is
particularly
significant
in
this
case
that
even
judge
fahy
in
his
opinions
and
i
assume
misconduct
is
misbehavior.
what
--
and
his
dissent
was
--
went
off
on
what
we
believe
is
the
most
difficult
question
here
and
that
is
did
congress
in
the
federal
contempt
statute
cut
down
the
power
of
the
court
to
a
point
where
they
cannot
deal
with
this
particular
misbehavior
through
contempt?
and
that
we
believe
is
the
real
point
on
which
the
case
turns.
mr.
gray
thoron
we
believe
they
have
done
that,
your
honor
that
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
that
--
that
they
have,
but
an
argument
can
be
made
that
they
--
that
--
that
they
--
and
petitioner
makes
the
argument.
judge
fahy
adopts
the
argument
that
--
that
congress
--
the
contempt
statute
excluded
not
that
this
fellow
was
not
an
officer
of
the
court,
but
that
his
approach
to
the
grand
jurors
did
not
constitute
an
official
transaction.
mr.
gray
thoron
they
--
mr.
gray
thoron
they
--
i
like
to
cite
at
least
an
opinion
to
this
court,
unanimous
opinion
in
the
bramblett
case,
which
i
think
has
some
pertinence
on
this
specific
question.
the
court,
they
are
speaking
through
mr.
justice
reed,
pointed
out
criminal
statutes
of
course
had
to
be
construed
strictly,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
every
criminal
statute
must
be
given
the
narrowest
possible
meaning
in
complete
disregard
of
the
purpose
of
the
legislature.
now,
you
could
make
an
argument
that
bramblett's
conduct
was
not
covered
by
that
statute
in
the
case,
but
the
history
of
the
legislation
indicated
that
it
was,
and
we
believe
that
the
same
thing
applies
here.
when
congress
singled
out,
of
course,
the
story
of
the
first
subsection
of
the
contempt
statute,
misbehavior
in
the
presence
or
so
near
thereto.
i
believe
it's
familiar
to
all
the
members
of
the
court
and
one
time
it
was
given
a
broad
causal
construction
and
now
has
a
narrower
geographical
construction
which
appears
to
be
correct
in
the
light
of
the
history.
but
when
congress
specifically
picked
out
the
conduct
misbehavior
of
officers
of
the
court
in
their
official
transactions
with
no
such
limitations
as
where
committed,
we
find
there
a
pretty
strong
intent
to
give
the
court
power
to
protect
its
own
institutions
from
the
unusually
devastating
effect
of
misbehavior
by
an
officer
of
the
court.
when
a
lawyer
makes
this
approach,
it
has
a
greater
potential
impact
than
when
an
individual,
grand
jurors
as
one
and
instructed,
i
have
the
specific
instruction
which
was
given
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
you
will
of
course
permit
no
one
on
the
outside
to
talk
with
you
concerning
any
matter
relating
to
the
discharge
of
your
duty.
now,
when
an
individual
approaches
on
that
subject,
i
think
they
feel
we
don't
have
to
talk
to
you
and
before
a
lawyer
approaches
him,
he
says,
“i'm
representing
this
particular
client
and
in
the
interest
of
justice,
you
have
a
duty,”
and
those
are
the
words
he
used
on
page
2
and
3
--
excuse
me,
your
honor,
page
3
and
4
of
the
record.
it
is
as
you
know
at
the
top
of
page
4,
your
duty
as
a
citizen
to
help
enlighten
the
court
on
an
issue
which
affects
the
liberty
of
a
citizen
on
trial
in
a
criminal
case.
these
grand
jurors
took
this
letter
to
the
--
to
judge
fahy,
and
that's
what,
again,
the
investigation
which
led
to
he
--
this
contempt
proceeding.
now,
that
--
that
has
much
more
potential
impact
on
a
grand
jury
where
his
--
his
motives
are
being
questioned
by
a
lawyer
in
a
case
and
some
of
these
questions
are
awfully
broad
and
--
and
suggestive.
we've
set
forth
on
page
4
and
5
of
our
brief
some
fairly
typical
examples.
do
you
think
that
a
vote
not
to
indict
a
publicized
communist
might
affect
the
government
employee's
employment
status
in
anyway,
such
as
possible,
promotions,
assignments,
selection
to
layoff
in
the
current
production
of
force?
pretty
probing
and
suggesting
questions
which
suggest
that
--
that
the
jurors
may
have
violated
the
oath
which
they
took
to
return
presentments
and
indictments
without
fairly
with
the
--
i
haven't
got
the
formula
at
my
fingertips,
but
obviously,
these
grand
jurors
has
had
impact
on
and
they
sought
advice
from
the
court.
and
while
in
this
particular
case,
the
--
the
fact
that
he
--
he
--
that
petitioner
felt
that
he
was
acting
properly
and
we
do
not
in
anyway
doubt
his
motives.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
mr.
gray
thoron
your
honor,
as
i
--
as
i
understand
--
well,
assuming
relevance,
i
think
there's
a
dispute
as
to
whether
these
are
especially
relevant.
mr.
gray
thoron
as
i
understand
rule
6
--
mr.
gray
thoron
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
--
rule
6
(b)
provides
a
procedure
for
moving
to
quash
or
dismiss
the
indictment
on
grounds
which
might
for
him
disqualify
a
grand
juror.
mr.
gray
thoron
it
seems
to
me
that
will
be
perfectly
appropriate
whether
there's
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
what
--
what
--
whether
there
is
a
rule
or
not
if
the
judge
denied
that.
that
might
be
a
reversible
error.
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
has
split
seven
to
two
in
the
emspak
and
quinn
case
whether
they
heard
both
of
those
and
back.
at
least
they
heard
one
of
them
on
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
right
for
those
reversible
errors,
not
to
accord
the
defendant
in
that
case
a
hearing
on
this
question.
and
the
question
was
argued
at
length
or
briefed
at
length
in
the
--
in
the
government's
brief
and
i
assume
the
opposing
briefs
in
the
quinn
case,
but
the
court
didn't
reach
that
question.
i
was
asked
one
of
the
open
questions
in
the
district.
and
certainly,
there
is
no
impropriety
in
attempting
to
establish
the
record
in
a
proper
way,
but
we
believe
that
going
to
the
grand
jurors
without
telling
the
court
in
this
broad
fashion,
constitutes
a
clear
impropriety
in
terms
of
the
presence.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
would
--
mr.
gray
thoron
you
--
you
would
like
--
mr.
gray
thoron
we
will
make
some
inquiries
and
see
what
we
will
be
glad
to
file
what
--
mr.
gray
thoron
it's
my
--
it's
my
understanding
that
the
--
it
was
felt
that
the
petitioner
should
be
--
should
in
no
way
be
interfered
with
in
his
representation
of
mr.
gold.
the
trial
--
it
was
a
difficult
case,
hotly
contested
and
it
came
to
trial
in
april.
and
the
--
although
the
court
had
directed
the
district
attorney
to
investigate
the
case
when
it
first
came
up
in
september,
i
gather
that
the
feeling
was
that
they
should
wait
until
the
gold
trial
was
over.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
gold
trial,
i
believe
the
--
the
date
that
is
given
in
the
brief,
petitioner's
brief
was
april
27th.
i
thought
the
gold
judgment
was
entered
april
30.
it
was
the
end
of
april
and
this
was
filed
10
days
later.
it
--
it
followed
relatively
quickly
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
when
this
petitioner
that
they
didn't
want
that
there
be
any
indication
of
harassment
of
this
petitioner
in
the
handling
of
this
specific
case.
it
seems
to
me
in
view
of
the
limited
time
that
i
should
say
something
about
the
question
of
official
transaction,
which
we
find
the
most
difficult
question
which
this
record
presents.
this
--
until
the
nye
case
was
decided
in
--
by
this
court
in
1941,
it
had
not
been
customary
as
far
as
we
can
see
to
proceed,
specifically
under
the
second
subdivision
of
the
contempt
statute
just
about
anything
which
constituted
a
obstruction
to
the
administration
of
justice
so
near
to
the
court
under
the
causal
connection.
that
was
the
typical
section
which
was
utilized.
in
fact,
i
studied
the
record
in
several
of
these
cases,
schmidt
case
in
particular
and
there
was
no
--
the
facts
were
just
set
forth
and
it
was
said
these
facts
constitute
contempt.
they
saw
that
even
though
lawyers
have
been
found
guilty
of
contempt
for
obstructing
the
administration
of
justice
where
their
act
was
not
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court,
we
have
a
new
--
well,
once
the
nye
decision
was
decided,
there
was
a
greater
necessity
to
consider
the
specific
problems.
the
best
consideration
of
the
court,
by
this
court,
in
fact,
the
only
consideration
by
this
court
prior
to
the
only
significant
consideration,
prior
to
the
nye
decision
was
in
the
bradley
and
the
pertinent
extract
is
set
forth
on
page
36
of
the
record.
it
was
quoted
at
length
in
--
in
--
by
judge
danaher
in
his
majority
opinion.
and
he
quotes
from
this
1868
opinion,
which
did
discuss
the
reasons
why
congress
would've
specified
a
broader
scope
for
contempt
applicable
to
its
officers
than
those
applicable
to
people
generally.
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
what
we
have
is
a
--
is
a
reorganization
that
lawyers,
when
they
are
guilty
of
misconduct
in
a
transaction
in
direct
dealings
with
the
court
in
a
matter
of
official
concern
to
both
the
court
and
the
lawyer,
and
as
mr.
ford
stated
in
his
argument,
petitioner
entered
into
his
obligations
as
an
officer
of
the
court
when
he
filed
his
appearance.
but
there's
a
greater
potentiality
for
corruption
that
does
not
make
it,
that
--
that
made
congress
specify
that
these
contempts,
no
matter
where
committed
by
an
officer
of
the
court
were
appropriate
for
use
in
the
contempt
power.
now,
several
members
of
this
court
have
suggested
that
there
should
be
a
right
of
trial
by
jury
in
all
contempt
cases.
and
the
--
therefore,
we
--
since
precedent
is
against
that
view,
the
statute
should
be
as
narrowly
construed
as
possible.
without
getting
into
that
particular
debate,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
--
this
court,
even
though
congress
may
not
have
specified
for
jury
trial
in
this
kind
of
contempt
case,
they
have
specified
it
in
certain
other
kinds,
certain
labor
cases
and
certain
cases
where
the
contempt
at
the
same
time
constitutes
a
crime.
if
this
court
felt
that
the
jury,
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
was
so
important,
they
could,
by
the
rule
or
through
their
power
to
supervise
the
proceedings
of
the
court
adopt
such
a
rule,
but
that
is
not
a
reason
it
seems
to
us
for
emasculating
the
contempt
statute.
where
to
do
so
would
leave
the
court
virtually
powerless
to
protect
the
public,
to
protect
the
public
by
ensuring
in
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
grand
jury
system.
incidentally,
in
this
case,
no
demand
for
a
jury
trial
was
made.
there's
really
no
need
for
one.
the
facts
were
not
disputed.
it
was
just
what
--
the
only
question
was
the
legal
question.
did
these
facts
constitute
contempt?
we
urge
that
the
judgment
below
be
affirmed.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
--
i
know
of
no
case
that
has
actually
gone
that
far.
we
cite
several
cases.
we
discussed
the
specific
problem
on
pages
26
to
31
of
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
--
i
would
want
to
reread
chief
justice
taney
opinion
in
the
wortman
case
when
he
was
sitting
on
the
circuit,
in
the
circuit
court
of
maryland
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
29.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
don't
know
whether
--
i
would
want
to
reread.
mr.
gray
thoron
because
chief
judge
taney
said
as
regards
to
the
question,
we
quote
this,
“whether
a
contempt
has
or
has
not
been
committed,
it
does
not
depend
on
the
intention
of
the
party
but
upon
the
act
he
has
done.
it
is
a
conclusion
of
law
from
the
act,”
and
that
certainly
goes
a
long
way
it
seems
to
me
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
gray
thoron
i'm
not
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
such
case,
your
honor.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
many
judges
have
found
that
lawyer
guilty
of
contempt.
i
think
there
is
plenty
of
precedent
for
that
and
i'm
not
familiar
of
any
case
where
the
lawyer
has
--
has
appealed
convictions
of
that
time
--
kind.
i'm
familiar
with
one
such
case
where
the
fine
was
$10.
there
was
a
law
in
england
and
he
was
late
a
second
time
and
a
$10
--
mr.
gray
thoron
it
seems
to
--
mr.
gray
thoron
it
seems
to
me
it
also
is
in
second
category,
but
it's
not
important
where
it's
covered
by
two
categories.
and
yet,
it
is
not
clearly
defined,
spelled
out
just
what
misbehaviors.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
--
i
went
to
the
congressional
debates
in
1831
and
i'm
familiar
with
several
of
the
articles
which
have
discussed
the
history
and
i'm
familiar
with
pennsylvania
statute,
new
york
statute
which
--
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
the
pennsylvania
statute
--
mr.
gray
thoron
do
you
mean
the
federal
--
the
federal
statute?
mr.
gray
thoron
that
is
the
--
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
it's
the
1831
legislation
and
the
wording
is
virtually
the
same.
i
jotted
down
the
wording
in
1831.
the
act
defined
as
contempt,
misbehavior
of
any
of
the
officers
of
the
said
courts
in
their
official
transactions,
virtually,
the
same
wording
as
misbehavior
of
any
of
its
officers
in
their
official
transaction
in
substance
identical.
mr.
gray
thoron
well,
it
depends
i
suppose
on
your
background
and
if
i
can
be
permitted
to
mention
my
background
as
a
teacher
of
professional
responsibility
and
legal
ethics,
i
think
in
those
terms
and
i
try
to
inculcate
my
students
with
the
feeling,
they
are
officers
of
the
court.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
problems
of
--
of
interpreting
intent,
we
know
there
were
many
--
mr.
gray
thoron
many
--
when
congress
made
up
of
many
lawyers
and
the
distinguished
lawyer
like
james
buchanan
who
sponsored
this
--
this
act
and
lawyers
reading
it,
i
think
it's
always
been
assumed
that
they
are
officers
of
the
court.
mr.
gray
thoron
and
there
--
there
is
a
conflict.
i
should
--
i
should
call
at
your
attention,
i
am
not
sure
that
our
brief
does
this
that
--
that
we
believe
that
the
first
circuit
in
the
ferris
--
i
think
it's
the
ferris
case
cited
on
the
--
the
--
by
the
other
side
on
pages
21
and
22.
the
first
circuit
seems
to
go,
the
cases
are
distinguishable,
but
your
honor
should
read
the
ferris
case,
the
schmidt
case
which
you
can
read
in
a
number
of
different
ways
and
it's
very
confusing,
it
first
came
up
before
the
nye
case
was
decided
and
that
it
came
up
the
second
time
after
the
nye
case
was
decided.
some
arguments
were
made
in
that
case.
”well,
if
we
can't
get
him
for”
--
this
was
jury
communicating
with
the
jury,
“if
we
can't
get
him
under
the
first
sub
section,
maybe,
we
can
get
him
under
the
second.
there
case
--
the
case
was
complicated
with
a
six
months
penalty
the
second
time,
six
months
contempt
a
confession
of
error
by
the
government
that
that
sentence
was
too
heavy
and
the
court
in
one
sentence
did
say,
“we
don't
think
this
is
official.”
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
well,
again,
it's
hard
to
know.
i
can
distinguish
the
cases,
but
i
think
the
first
circuit
in
the
--
mr.
gray
thoron
the
first
circuit
in
the
ferris
case
found
that
there
had
been
no
contempt
of
court
when
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
went
up
to
somebody,
the
wife
of
a
prospective
witness
or
a
codefendant
who
he
just
learned
had
pleaded
guilty
and
he
thought
was
going
to
turn
the
state
evidence
and
was
guilty
of
making
some
threats,
which
certainly
indicated
that
if
this
fellow
acted
as
a
stool
pigeon,
he
--
he
knew
that
it
was
going
to
come
to
him.
and
that's
fairly
close
it
seems
to
me,
although
it
was
not.
mr.
gray
thoron
he
wasn't
dealing
with
an
arm
of
the
court.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
the
opinion
in
that
case
said
the
government
doesn't
urge
that
this
is
official
--
an
official
transaction.
we
don't
think
it
is,
but
they
do
mention
that
point
in
this
case,
so
we
think
that
the
recent
cases,
the
first
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
indicate
a
very
narrow
interpretation.
and
that
judge
danaher,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals,
a
broader
one
which
is
a
--
is
correct
in
terms
of
what
congress
must
have
intended
in
terms
of
purpose
and
though
it
could
be
argued
both
ways
and
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
this
court
should
resolve
that
specific
conflict
and
we
urge
you
to
resolve
that
as
we
suggest.
