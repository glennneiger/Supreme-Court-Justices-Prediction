i
think,
mr.

your
time
has

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
thoron,
by
the
same
reasoning,
if
judge
kirkland
thought
it
was
proper
in
another
criminal
case
for
counsel
to
interrogate
the
grand
jury,
why
wouldn't
it
be
proper
here?
is
that
a
matter
of
discretion
in
each
case
whether
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
the
counsel
can
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
concede?
do
you
concede
that
it
would
be
all
right
for
counsel
to
interrogate
the
grand
jury
concerning
personal
bias?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
in
the
law
that
says
the
court
shall
give
permission
in
such
cases?is
that
a
--
is
that
a
matter
of
statute
law
or
--
or
is
it
a
matter
of
judgment
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
thoron,
you
--
you
say
that
you
don't
believe
that
judge
kirkland's
words
were
an
invitation
to
all
the
bar
to
do
it.
do
you
mean
that
he
could
give
permission
to
one
lawyer
to
test
the
bias
of
--
of
the
grand
jury
in
that
way
but
deny
it
to
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
you
said
a
moment
--
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
you
couldn't
conceive
whether
a
court
committing
a
man
for
contempt
if
--
if
the
judge
told
him
it
was
all
right
to
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
same
one,
but
he'd
be
in
danger
of
every
other
judge.

you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
the
information,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thoron,
there
was
one
--
one
thing
about
this
record
that
i
wanted
to
buy
and
that
is
if
--
if
this
was
such
an
obvious
impropriety
and
if
it
did
disturb
the
--
the
decorum
of
this
institution,
and
the
summary
process
was
to
be
used,
why
did
the
government
wait
eight
months
to
initiate
it?
