mr.
charles
e.
ford
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
the
statute
involved
in
this
case
is
paragraph
401
(2)
of
title
18
which
provides,
“a
court
of
the
united
states
shall
have
the
power
to
punish
by
fine
or
imprisonment
at
its
discretion
such
contempt
of
its
authority
and
none
other
as
(2)
misbehavior
of
any
of
its
officers
in
their
official
transactions.”
i'd
like
to
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
in
this
that
there
are
three
questions
involved.
one,
did
the
petitioner's
conduct
constitute
misbehavior.
two,
was
petitioner's
conduct
particularly
in
writing
a
letter
accompanied
by
a
questionnaire
an
official
transaction
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
i
have
already
referred
to.
and
third,
may
the
petitioner
be
adjudged
in
criminal
contempt
where
the
trial
court
sitting
both
as
judge
and
jury
found
as
a
fact
that
it
had
doubt
that
the
acts
of
the
petitioner
were
committed
in
conscious
wrong
and
where
the
same
court
made
no
finding
that
the
petitioner
either
intended
to
or
did
obstruct
justice
and
where
the
court
below
made
no
finding
that
a
--
the
petitioner
was
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
on
june
the
15th,
1954,
petitioner
was
convicted
of
criminal
contempt
or
misbehavior
in
an
official
transaction
alleged
under
the
statute.
the
proceeding
was
instituted
by
a
petition
filed
by
the
--
the
united
states
attorney
in
our
district
court
and
an
order
was
issued
based
upon
that
petition.
petitioner
timely
filed
a
verified
answer
to
the
district
attorney's
petition
and
that
was
accompanied
with
certain
exhibits
which
appear
at
some
length
in
the
transcript
of
the
record.
there
was
no
challenge
of
any
kind
made
to
any
of
the
facts
alleged
in
petitioner's
answer
nor
to
the
exhibits
accompanying
it.
thereupon,
the
case
was
tried
by
the
district
court
on
the
pleadings
alone.
the
misbehavior,
particular
misbehavior,
that
was
complained
of
was
that
the
petitioner,
cammer,
sent
a
letter
with
an
accompanying
questionnaire
to
13
grand
jurors,
a
majority
of
the
grand
jury,
all
of
whom
were
government
employees.
and
that
letter
and
questionnaire
concerned
the
effect
of
the
loyalty
and
security
programs
on
their
ability
to
act
as
grand
jurors
without
bias
and
impartiality
in
a
case
such
as
the
gold
case,
which
i
will
identify
suddenly.
on
--
mr.
charles
e.
ford
he
sent
it
--
mr.
charles
e.
ford
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
e.
ford
yes,
your
honor.
the
grand
jury
was
still
in
session
at
the
time.
on
august
of
28th
in
1953,
the
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment
against
one,
ben
gold,
and
that
indictment
charged
him
with
having
filed
a
false
non-communist
affidavit
with
the
national
relations
board.
petitioner,
cammer,
a
member
of
the
new
york
bar
was
retained
as
attorney
for
ben
gold.
and
three
days
after
the
indictment
was
returned,
he
properly
filed
his
appearance
as
an
attorney
for
ben
gold.
thereupon,
he
proceeded
to
perform
and
exercise
his
duties,
his
obligations
and
his
privileges
as
an
attorney
to
his
client
and
as
an
officer
of
the
court.
upon
arraignment,
the
defendant,
gold,
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
judge
laws,
the
district
court
judge,
allowed
30
days
within
which
to
file
any
pretrial
motions
by
the
defendant
and
his
counsel.
at
this
time,
petitioner,
cammer,
knew
that
on
two
previous
occasions,
the
same
case
against
ben
gold
had
been
presented
to
two
different
grand
juries
in
new
york
and
no
indictment
had
been
returned.
with
that
knowledge
of
that
factual
situation,
petitioner
immediately
after
arraignment
went
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
asked
for
and
received
a
roster
of
the
grand
jurors.
his
examination
of
that
roster
disclosed
that
the
majority
of
the
grand
jury,
to
wit,
13
were
government
employees.
this
examination
of
the
roster
was
preliminary
and
part
of
a
study
which
was
his
obligation
to
his
client
to
perform
in
order
to
determine
what
if
any
pretrial
motions
should
be
filed
on
behalf
of
the
defendant,
gold.
mr.
charles
e.
ford
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
i
believe.
and
the
rule
that
it
governs
is
i
believe
rule
6
of
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
regarding
motions,
regarding
the
eligibility
of
grand
jurors
and
other
jurors.
and
in
certain
cases,
which
i
think
i
will
cite
to,
your
honor,
i
believe
in
this
particular
kind
of
a
case
because
of
the
type
of
issues
that
would
be
in
the
gold
trial.
there
are
--
distinguishes
it
from
many
others.
thereupon,
petitioner
made
a
thorough
and
careful
study
of
the
law
respecting
the
qualification
of
government
employees
in
such
a
case
as
the
gold
case
where
the
issue
of
communism
must
exist.
and
then
after
giving
a
study
of
the
law,
he
gave
a
study
and
sort
to
find
out
the
means
of
challenging
a
situation
that
he
believed
to
exist
in
front
of
the
grand
jury.
that
search
of
the
law
disclosed
that
while
many
attacks
had
been
made
by
pretrial
motions
show
--
to
show
the
bias
of
a
grand
jury,
he
found
it
most
of
them
had
failed
for
one
reason
alone
because
of
the
lack
of
truth
of
the
bias
or
impartiality
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
charles
e.
ford
--
of
this
court,
the
dennis
case,
the
one
--
which
are
cited
in
the
brief.
and
after
reading
them,
he
became
convinced
as
was
said
by
this
court
in
the
dennis
case
that
the
preservation
of
the
opportunity
to
prove
actual
bias
is
a
guarantee
of
a
defendant's
rights
to
an
impartial
jury.
and
the
court
further
said
that
the
way
is
open
in
every
case
to
raise
a
contention
of
bias
from
the
realm
of
speculation
to
the
realm
of
facts.
using
as
he
should,
the
law
is
laid
down
by
this
court,
the
highest
court
in
the
land,
if
he
was
in
obedience
to
what
this
court
said
in
those
case
then
indeed
he
was
practicing
the
highest
ethics
that
any
lawyer
can
conceive
of
or
practice.
then,
he
went
further,
and
he
read
the
records
and
the
briefs
in
two
cases
that
were
one
in
our
court
of
appeals
of
this
district,
and
the
other
in
the
district
court,
which
are
known
as
the
emspak
case
and
the
weinberg
case,
both
of
which
are
cited
in
the
brief.
and
he
did
that
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
appropriate
means,
whereby,
suspected
bias
might
be
established
as
a
fact.
he,
the
petitioner
found
that
the
challenge
in
the
emspak
case
failed
on
the
ground
as
urged
by
the
government
that
a
defendant
desiring
to
challenge
the
qualifications
of
government
employees
as
grand
jurors
was
under
the
duty
himself
to
interview
such
grand
jurors
in
order
to
determine
whether
bias
in
fact
existed
before
applied
to
the
court
for
relief.
and
in
the
absence
of
such
effort
and
showing,
based
thereon,
he
was
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
and
he
found
on
page
9
of
the
record
of
his,
and
he
found
as
his
guide
by
all
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
government
had
urged
on
our
court
of
appeals
on
that
day
in
the
emspak
case
as
follows.
this
appears
in
the
government's
own
brief
in
that
case.
the
appellant
in
this
motion
was
not
only
asserting
that
at
least
eight
of
the
12
members
of
the
grand
jury
indicated
in
this
motion
were
prejudiced
and
disqualified,
but
was
promising
to
prove
this
if
he
was
given
an
opportunity,
“yet,”
says
the
government,
“there
is
not
the
slightest
indication
in
the
long
motion
and
offer
of
proof
that
any
attempt
has
been
made
to
interview
a
single
long
of
apportions.”
so,
in
that
case,
in
the
government's
brief,
my
government
indicated
and
complained
of
the
fact
that
he
should
have
in
that
case
that
defendant
or
his
counsel
interviewed
grand
jurors.
even
the
government
at
that
very
point
sets
up
and
suggests
the
guy
to
a
lawyer,
for
it
says
and
complaints
about
his
failure
to
interview
grand
jurors.
then,
it
went
on
to
say
under
all
of
the
circumstances
that
it's
clear
that
the
court
acted
properly
in
denying
the
motion
for
a
hearing
in
the
absence
of
any
reason
for
appellant,
not
making
his
whole
showing
in
the
usual
form
of
affidavits.
it
can
be
asserted
on
this
review
that
the
trial
judge
had
exclusive
discretion
to
deny
a
hearing.
and
then,
the
government
went
on
again
and
advised
not
only
your
petitioner,
but
all
other
lawyers
in
the
practice
of
law.
and
it
said,
“the
appellant
was
trying
to
get
the
court
to
make
an
investigation
which
the
appellant
himself
had
--
should
make.”
now,
when
cammer
makes
what
the
government
says
should
have
been
made,
the
government
now
complains.
was
it
not
just
for
the
petitioner,
cammer,
to
use
that
as
a
guide,
the
expression
of
what
the
government
of
the
united
states
thinks
is
the
proper
conduct
for
a
lawyer
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
and
then,
again,
the
petitioner
further
learned
in
addition
to
this
case
and
the
others
i
have
cited
that
the
same
issue
was
involved
in
the
weinberg
case,
and
he
then,
as
a
lawyer
should,
investigated,
researched
and
studied
the
file
of
that
case,
the
briefs
in
the
memorandums.
and
what
did
he
find
there
as
his
guide
to
what
means
should
be
adopted
to
establish
the
right
of
a
defendant,
to
establish
bias
in
a
grand
jury.
he
found
that
in
a
bench
ruling
by
judge
kirkland
in
the
weinberg
case,
judge
kirkland
upheld
the
government's
contention
that
a
defendant
could
not
apply
for
a
hearing
unless
he
had
first
undertaken
to
contact
grand
jurors
to
ascertain
preliminarily
the
existence
of
bias.
and
judge
kirkland,
speaking
for
the
district
court
and
guiding
all
lawyers,
said,
“there
is
nothing
to
prevent
counsel
if
he
sees
fit
contacting
those
15
members
of
the
grand
jury
and
enquiring
on
only
one
subject,
whether
or
not
they
had
any
personal
bias
for
the
defendant
and
on
that
account
did
they
return
the
indictment.”
that
will
appear
may
it
please
this
court
as
exhibit
a
on
page
13
of
the
record.
thereupon,
in
the
further
step
of
this
lawyer
in
the
exercise
of
his
obligations
and
duties,
he
has
the
district
court
telling
him
that
there
is
nothing
in
your
way
to
go
and
contact
and
interview
these
grand
jurors.
thereupon,
the
letter
that
was
used
in
the
weinberg
case
and
appears
in
the
record,
this
plaintiff
or
rather,
this
petitioner
copied
that
letter
verbatim,
except
of
course
for
the
name
to
which
they
were
addressed.
the
petitioner's
questionnaire,
which
is
a
conduct
complained
of
set
forth
the
same
matters
that
were
contained
in
the
weinberg
questionnaire,
except
that
it
was
more
condensed
and
weinberg's
counsel
had
sent
the
letter
and
the
questionnaire
for
the
judge
had
told
him
there
was
nothing
to
stand
in
his
way
of
either
contacting
of
grand
jurors
in
a
case
of
this
type
to
establish
that
particular
matter.
mr.
charles
e.
ford
that
was
judge
kirkland,
your
honor.
then,
after
judge
kirkland
had
made
that
direction
to
the
attorney,
then
weinberg's
counsel
filed
a
second
motion.
and
in
that
motion,
weinberg's
counsel
had
set
forth
the
letter
he
sent,
the
questionnaire
and
also
a
statement
that
he
had
received
no
answers
from
him.
now,
that
second
motion,
i
think
your
honors
will
find
on
the
page
4
of
the
cammer
brief,
or
rather,
on
page
4,
your
honors
will
find
the
questions
that
were
propounded
in
the
questionnaire.
now,
when
the
second
motion
came
on,
it
came
in
front
of
judge
holtzoff,
and
at
no
time,
when
another
judge
of
the
district
court
had
this
letter
from
the
judge
holtzoff
criticized
or
in
any
suggest
to
recommend
that
it
was
bad
conduct
on
the
part
of
weinberg's
lawyers
to
file
and
send
the
letter
or
the
questionnaire.
and
in
our
brief,
there
will
be
found
a
statement
that
was
made
by
judge
holtzoff
when
he
had
before
him
a
letter
and
questionnaire
that
was
filed
by
weinberg's
counsel
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
if
he
were
a
grand
juror,
he
would
close
in
the
best
of
it.
and
then,
he
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
--
he
spoke
of
the
history
of
the
grand
jury
on
its
impartiality
and
bias
and
it
wasn't
necessary
for
them
to
be
so,
but
at
no
time,
this
second
judge
give
any
suggestion
or
him
that
it
was
improper
conduct
for
weinberg's
lawyer
to
send
the
letter
of
the
questionnaire
and
that
was
all
that
petitioner
cammer
did
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
therefore,
again,
petitioner
is
using
as
his
guide
the
law
has
set
down
by
this
court
by
the
standard
set
by
the
government
and
by
the
facts
having
judge
kirkland
speaking
for
the
district
court
told
him
actually
that
he
could
do
what
he
did
do.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
the
second
question
which
i
have
proposed
to
your
honors,
whether
or
not
this
was
an
official
transaction,
if
i
may
due
to
the
shortness
of
time,
i
would
like
to
adopt
as
my
argument
on
that
point
the
dissenting
opinion
our
circuit
in
this
case
which
was
written
by
judge
fahy,
and
particularly
where
he
held
that
under
this
statute,
this
was
not
an
official
communication
by
an
officer
of
the
court.
and
in
speaking
of
that
in
court,
he
said,
page
15
of
the
opinion,
“but
when
communicated
by
mail
with
grand
jurors
to
obtain
information
in
preparing
his
client's
case,
he
was
not
engaging
in
an
official
transaction
as
an
officer
of
the
court.”
in
other
words
i
do
not
think
congress
intended
by
this
statute
that's
involved
here,
the
grand
courts,
the
power
by
summary
proceedings
to
police
such
professional
behavior
of
a
member
of
the
bar.
the
well-known
avenues
for
suspending
this
party
or
otherwise
disciplining
the
attorneys
are
available
to
reach
their
unprofessional
and
unethical
conduct.
the
criminal
law
is
available
to
punish
them
for
criminal
offenses
where
they
will
be
afforded
the
normal
safeguard
surrounding
the
criminal
prosecution
and
he
cites
nye
versus
the
united
states.
and
contempt
proceedings
are
also
available
to
punish
misbehavior
of
any
person
in
the
court's
presence
or
so
near
thereto
as
to
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice
or
disobedience
or
resistance
to
the
court's
lawful
writ,
process,
order,
rule,
decree,
or
command.
but
the
language
of
401
sub
(2),
misbehavior
of
court,
court
officers
in
their
official
transactions
is
not
at
wording
to
include
a
broad
suite
of
professional
behavior
of
attorneys,
not
in
the
presence
of
the
court
or
so
near
thereto
to
as
to
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice.
the
language
no
doubt
does
apply
to
the
official
conduct
of
offices
of
the
court,
such
as,
for
example,
clerk
and
marshal,
referees,
trustees,
masters
and
attorneys
of
fair
and
special
capacity.
and
then,
the
court
went
on
and
without
delivering
the
point,
may
i
adapt
as
by
argument
the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
fahy
in
the
court.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
third
question.
could
petitioner
be
found
guilty
as
he
was
of
criminal
contempt
where
the
trial
court
found
as
a
fact
and
judge
laws
sat,
both
his
judge
and
jury,
that
he
had
a
doubt
that
the
petitioner
cammer's
acts
were
committed
in
conscious
wrong.
now,
may
i
read
a
part
of
that
opinion
which
appears
page
26
of
the
record?
and
i
am
reading
the
language
of
judge
ross.
“while
the
court
finds
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
impropriety
of
what
respondent
has
done.
it
is
not
without
doubt
on
the
record
before
the
court
as
to
whether
respondent's
acts
were
committed
in
conscious
wrong.
there
seems
to
be
a
reason
to
believe
that
the
respondent
may
have
misconceived
the
proprieties.
what
he
did
was
open.
there
was
no
appropriate
personal
approach
to
jurors.
there
was
--
there
is
indication
respondent
may
have
believed
he
had
a
right
to
propound
the
questions
at
the
time
he
did,
not
withstanding
the
court
is
of
the
opinion
he
had
not.
now,
the
court
--
the
government
meets
that
issue
by
saying
that
what
the
judge
was
talking
about
was
in
relation
to
the
sentence
that
he
had
imposed,
which
was
a
$100
fine.
and
throughout
the
government's
brief,
it
relates
to
the
using
the
word
mere
and
only
a
$100
fine,
or
greater
than
any
money
i
possess
is
the
integrity
that
i
posses
as
a
lawyer
and
as
a
member
of
the
bar.
i
can
conceive
of
no
more
condemnation
than
i
can
receive
than
to
be
held
by
an
american
court
in
contempt
of
it.
the
money
will
make
no
difference.
the
issue
in
this
case
cannot
be
measured
in
those
terms.
the
only
measure
that
can
be
made
is
that
when
a
lawyer
has
a
guilty
conviction
of
contempt
and
of
criminal
contempt
upon
him
in
my
judgment,
his
usefulness
is
at
an
end
as
a
lawyer.
that
conviction
will
long
stand
with
him
the
rest
of
his
life,
and
i
submit
that
is
the
answer
to
the
government's
reference
throughout
its
brief
to
the
$100
fine.
now,
again,
petitioner
in
his
verified
answer,
which
was
not
in
anyway
challenged
at
anytime,
asserted
that
he
did
not
intend
nor
did
any
of
his
acts
obstruct
the
administration
of
justice.
at
no
time,
nowhere
does
the
government
challenge
that
as
a
fact.
in
--
in
fact,
in
a
memorandum
filed
by
the
government
in
this
court
which
will
be
found
at
the
page,
the
bottom
of
page
7
of
the
cammer
brief,
this
court
will
respectfully
note
that
in
the
government's
memorandum
to
the
district
court
in
this
case
of
page
8
thereof,
it
stated,
“mr.
cammer
disclaims
any
effort
to
influence
the
grand
jury.”
the
government
does
not
charge
such
an
obstruction
of
justice.
then
again,
on
page
18
of
this
memorandum
filed
by
the
government
in
front
of
ross,
judge
ross,
it
goes
on
to
say,
“here,
it
is
not
charged
that
mr.
cammer's
conduct
amounts
to
an
obstruction
of
justice
and
that
it
amounts
to
influence
a
grand
jury
on
that
title
18.
we
respectfully
submit
therefore,
that
in
fact
and
in
truth,
this
conduct
complained
did
not
intend
to
or
did
it
and
did
not
as
a
fact
either
tend
to
influence
the
grand
jury
or
did
influence
it
or
obstructive
in
the
administration
of
justice.
further,
judge
ross
--
mr.
charles
e.
ford
may
i
make
one
other
mr.
charles
e.
ford
observation?
mr.
charles
e.
ford
i
would
like
to
make
one
observation.
at
the
end
of
the
gold
trial
tried
in
front
of
judge
mclaughlin
by
your
petitioner,
cammer,
which
lasted
for
weeks,
he,
judge
mclaughlin
commended
the
conduct
of
the
very
lawyer
who
is
before
you
now
as
a
petitioner,
and
your
honors
will
read
that
at
the
bottom
of
page
19
of
the
brief,
whereafter,
several
weeks,
his
conduct
has
been
commended
by
the
district
court
in
the
very
same
case,
the
ben
gold
case
and
here
he
stands
charged
with
something
which
even
judge
mclaughlin
said
and
we've
been
through
several
judges
as
your
honors
will
see
now
said
he
was
a
reputable
good
practicing
lawyer.
