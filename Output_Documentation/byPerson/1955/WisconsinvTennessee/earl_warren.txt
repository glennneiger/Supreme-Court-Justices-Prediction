attorney
general
thomson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general,
there
are
great
many
trade
barriers
that
reflect
in
the
same
way
against
states,
would
you
think
that
the
any
trade
barrier
could
be
the
subject
of
an
original
suit
here
as
between
the
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
(inaudible)
is
--
is
it
your
contention
that
they
have
not
made
the
proper
allegations
here
or
that
they
cannot
make
the
proper
allegations
to
get
into
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
economy
of
wisconsin
has
been
seriously
injured
by
this
--
by
this
law.
is
there
any
court
other
than
this
court
open
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
remedy
that
wrong
if
it's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
it
is
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that.
do
you
--
do
admit
mr.
(inaudible)
that
it
is
--
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
as
to
whether
we
should
take
this
case
or
do
you
claim
that
we
have
no
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
under
the
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
would
just
have
discretion,
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
that
that's
exactly
what
you
claimed
that
it
was
a
discretionary
matter
with
this
court
whether
we
would
take
it
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
didn't
get
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
apply
for
local
--
local
producers
and
distributors
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
avoid
that
discrimination?
isn't
that
a
discrimination
that
permits
local
producers
and
processors
to
--
to
sell
at
any
price
but
to
charge
interstate
producers
to
require
them
to
charge
a
higher
price
to
take
it
out
of
the
realm
of
competition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whose
cost?
chief
justice
earl
warren
fixed
by
whom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
understood
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
to
say
that
the
cost
--
the
minimum
cost
was
to
be
fixed
by
the
cost
of
doing
business
by
the
local
producers
and
distributors.
i
don't
know
whether
i
heard
him
correct
that
you
are
not
in
that
--
but
that's
what
i
--
i
understood
him
to
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
not
the
fact?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
every
--
every
distributor
that
--
that
came
in
from
the
outside
would
have
to
establish
some
action
that
what
his
cost
would
be
or
he
would
be
subject
to
imprisonment
under
this
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
a
claim
in
effect
though,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
local
--
a
local
distributor
himself
or
anything
he
wants
as
long
as
it
isn't
below
cost.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
his
cost.
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
own
personal
cost.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
anyone
coming
from
the
outside
cannot
sell
for
less
than
the
general
cost
in
the
industry
in
that
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
prevailing
price.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
see
any
discrimination
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
in
answer
to
my
question
that
there
was
no
forum
other
than
this
court
open
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
these
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
--
how
about
your
prosecuting
attorneys
on
the
criminal
--
under
the
criminal
sanction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
whom
in
a
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
an
obligation
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
assume
they
would,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
statement
--
was
the
statement
made
by
the
director
of
agriculture
that
he
did
not
propose
to
enforce
this
law
by
state
action?
was
that
made
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
someone
from
filing
a
complaint
claiming
that
he
threatened
to
enforce
this
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
purpose
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
what
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
legislature
has
--
has
said
that
he
should
then
that
it's
a
penal
offense
for
people
to
violate
that
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
the
court
would
like
to
have
that
information
if
it
doesn't
take
you
so
long.
if
it
takes
a
couple
of
days,
we
can
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
(inaudible),
if
you
can
have
your
memorandum
in
by
tomorrow
night
then
the
--
mr.
attorney
general,
if
you
could
have
yours
in
by
thursday.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
need
not
be
printed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
need
not
be
printed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general,
did
you
--
you
had
a
very
few
moments
left
if
you
wish
to
use
them.
