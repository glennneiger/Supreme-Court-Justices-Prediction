justice
harold
burton
mr.
attorney
general,
in
applying
your
claim
of
parens
patriae,
you
emphasized
the
number
of
uses
in
wisconsin,
or
the
numbers
people
are
affected.
would
your
right
be
the
same
if
it
was
a
small
number
instead
of
a
100,000?
the
legal
issue
would
be
the
same
would
it
not?
justice
harold
burton
but
if
it's
few,
could
you
or
the
state
come
in
and
--
and
bring
a
suit
against
another
state?
