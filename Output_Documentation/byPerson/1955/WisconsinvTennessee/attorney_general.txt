mr.
attorney
general
may
it
please
the
court.
we
don't
think
that
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
entertain
suits
between
states
rest
upon
the
effect
that
an
individual
suit
might
have
on
the
pocket
book
of
some
citizen
of
one
of
the
states.
it's
our
position
first
of
all
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
under
the
allegations
of
this
complaint
has
not
stated
a
cause
which
properly
invokes
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
secondly,
that
the
state
of
facts
in
wisconsin's
proposed
complaint
justified
this
court
in
exercising
its
discretion
in
the
matter
in
refusing
to
take
jurisdiction.
and
thirdly,
that
the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional.
now,
getting
to
a
number
of
questions
that
have
been
raised
from
the
bench
with
regard
to
the
rights
of
a
private
or
individual
producer
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
institute
such
an
action,
it's
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
prevent
a
producer
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
if
the
facts
are
such
that
bring
him
within
the
terms
of
the
act
from
coming
into
the
state
of
tennessee
and
sue
in
there
either
in
the
state
courts
or
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states,
or
if
an
action
is
brought
against
them
in
the
state
court,
he
can
resist
on
the
grounds
of
the
invalidity
of
this
statute.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
suit
to
test
the
statute
wherein
it
is
alleged
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
under
the
commerce
clause
is
now
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
nashville.
the
pleadings
and
the
orders
in
that
case
as
set
out
in
the
brief
that
there
is
a
private
litigant
who
is
in
court
who's
fighting
just
as
hard
as
he
can
to
get
the
same
kind
of
relief
that
wisconsin
is
trying
to
get
by
the
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
and
the
matter
is
now
pending,
waiting
for
it
to
be
set
before
a
three-judge
court.
now,
this
matter
is
of
primary
importance
for
this
reason.
it's
well
known
(inaudible)
only
those
who
are
affected
by
the
statute
can
question
its
constitutionality.
now,
as
an
example
of
what
i'm
talking
about
with
particular
reference
to
the
situation
that
we
have
before
us,
suppose
the
state
passes
an
act
taxing
the
sale
of
automobile
tires
and
suppose
i
as
a
merchant
go
in
and
allege
that
i
am
a
merchant
that
i
don't
like
the
statute
and
i
want
it
stricken
down.
well,
i
think
i
would
have
to
go
on
and
allege
that
i
was
engaged
in
the
sale
of
automobile
tires
before
acted
--
get
the
court
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
statute.
now,
we
say
that
that's
exactly
the
position
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
is
in
here.
wisconsin
said
we
have
a
dairy
industry.
we've
got
so
many
cows
and
we
produce
so
much
milk.
but
the
only
allegation
in
this
proposed
complaint
that
comes
anywhere
near
a
showing
that
wisconsin
people
and
wisconsin
producers
will
be
in
any
way
affected
by
this
act
is
the
allegation
that
huge
quantities
of
milk
produced
in
wisconsin
have
been
sold
in
tennessee.
now
the
statute
forbids
certain
marketing
practices
if
done
with
intent
to
injure
or
destroy
competition.
it
forbids
the
sale
of
milk
that
had
been
transported
into
a
marketing
area
at
less
than
the
prevailing
wholesale
or
retail
prices
place
of
sale.
marketing
areas
are
defined
as
being
counties
that
have
within
their
borders
municipalities
which
have
ordinance
is
regulating
the
grading
of
milk.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
proposed
complaint
to
any
wisconsin
producer.
transports
milk
into
any
marketing
area
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
proposed
complaint
that
any
wisconsin
producer
has
sold
milk
transported
in
such
a
marketing
area
so
as
to
violate
the
terms
of
this
act.
furthermore,
there
is
no
allegation
that
any
wisconsin
producer
has
any
desire
to
do
anything
that
could
possibly
be
construed
as
a
violation
of
this
act.
now,
the
point
i'm
making
is
this.
and
it
was
set
up
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
public
workers
against
mitchell.
unless
there
is
a
real
controversy,
neither
this
court
nor
any
other
court
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
lawsuit.
now,
in
that
case,
the
complainants
went
even
further
than
wisconsin
has
gone
here
because
they
alleged
that
they
wanted
to
engage
in
certain
political
activity.
they
wanted
to
be
poll
workers
and
they
wanted
to
go
out
and
solicit
for
various
candidates
and
all
those
things
were
forbidden
by
the
hatch
act
and
they
said
for
that
reason,
it's
unconstitutional.
but
this
court
held
that
they
should
have
been
repelled
in
the
lower
court
and
the
suit
was
finally
entertained
as
to
only
one
complainant
who
had
actually
done
something
that
violated
the
act.
now
that
brings
us
down
to
this
proposition,
before
any
suit,
in
any
court
should
be
entertained
to
test
the
validity
of
this
act,
the
complainant
in
the
suit
should
be
required
to
show
that
he
has
an
interest
in
the
matter.
he
has
an
interest
that
is
adversely
affected
by
the
act.
that
is
a
matter
that
can
be
threshed
out
in
the
district
court.
that
is
a
matter
that
can
be
threshed
out
in
the
state
court
between
some
individual
producer
in
the
state
of
tennessee
or
some
competitor.
all
those
matters
can
be
determined.
a
searching
inquiry
can
be
gone
into,
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
act
affects
him
and
whether
or
not
he's
entitled
to
maintain
it.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
it
is
not
sufficiently
particular.
i
think
the
entire
complaint,
proposed
complaint
fails
because
of
that.
i
think
furthermore
--
mr.
attorney
general
they
haven't
said
in
testimony.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
there'd
been
no
offer
to
do
so
as
i
understand
it.
i
realized
that
it
might
come
in
the
future.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
pennsylvania
against
west
virginia
was
an
entirely
different
proposition
for
this
reason.
the
statute
there
under
attack
unequivocally
placed
a
limitation
upon
the
exportation
of
natural
gas
from
the
state
of
west
virginia.
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
showed
very
clearly
that
this
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
--
not
only
people
of
pennsylvania
but
the
state
of
pennsylvania
itself
because
there
was
an
immediate
threat
by
the
mere
passage
of
the
act
to
cut
off
the
flow
of
natural
gas.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
and
its
people
were
consumers.
here,
you've
got
nothing
of
that
character.
now,
the
statute
went
on
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
think
it's
in
the
same
situation
as
the
pennsylvania
case
with
regard
to
the
matter
where
now
a
discretion
because
there
you
had
situation
where
the
damage
not
only
was
being
threatened
but
was
being
done
according
to
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
but
now
you
--
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
--
i
merely
mentioned
that
incidentally
to
show
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
without
any
doubt
was
going
to
suffer
both
in
a
propriety
capacity
and
there's
parens
patriae.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
--
i
think
you
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
you'd
have
a
different
case
if
wisconsin
went
on
to
allege
not
only
that
they
occupied
a
propriety
capacity
but
also
that
the
state
of
tennessee
had
done
something
that
affected
them
or
was
threatening
to
do
something
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
now,
there's
no
showing
of
that
here.
this
statute
went
on
the
books.
i
believe
it
was
the
28th
day
of
february
1955.
this
compliant
was
filed
some
time
in
october.
there's
no
allegation
in
it
that
any
milk
has
been
kept
out
of
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
there's
no
allegation
in
it
that
any
producer
has
suffered
a
penny
loss
or
he
suffered
at
all.
mr.
attorney
general
but
they
haven't
alleged
that
it's
been
enforced
in
a
way
that
hurts
them.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
our
contention
first
that
they
have
not
made
the
proper
allegations.
they
have
not
stated
a
cause
of
action.
it's
our
contention
in
the
second
place
that
they
can't
make
proper
allegation
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
suit.
mr.
attorney
general
not
--
mr.
attorney
general
not
that
i
know
of.
no,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
not
familiar
with
it
your
honor.
no,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
that's
my
decisions
in
not
having
read
it,
your
honor.
i
--
i
understand
that
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
and
that's
what
part
of
my
argument
is
directed
at
because
the
very
basis
of
the
lawsuit
can
only
be
determined
between
somebody
who's
engaged
in
the
sale
of
milk
and
milk
products.
it's
further
our
contention
that
the
statute
is
not
invalid
on
its
face.
as
pointed
out
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
--
i
think
first
that
you
have
no
jurisdiction
under
the
allegations.
secondly
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
if
you
do
have
jurisdiction,
it's
still
a
discretionary
matter.
as
pointed
out
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
attorney
general
only
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
i
failed
to
make
myself
clear
about
that.
mr.
attorney
general
we
say
first
you
have
none
and
secondly
it
should
not
be
exercised
if
the
court
has
it.
it's
further
the
insistence
of
the
state
of
tennessee
that
this
statute
is
not
invalid.
the
primary
complaint
about
it
in
the
proposed
pleading
is
that
it
is
a
direct
and
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
the
terms
of
the
statute
primarily
provide
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
sell
that
below
prevailing
wholesale
or
retail
price
at
the
place
of
sale,
milk
that
has
been
produced
for
resale
and
transported
into
a
marketing
area.
this
applies
not
only
to
milk
that
is
transported
across
state
lines
but
also
intrastate.
therefore,
we
insist
that
there
is
no
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce.
mr.
attorney
general
not
with
respect
to
that
particular
provision
of
the
statute.
mr.
attorney
general
it
might
be
if
they
were
permitted
to
charge
in
the
price.
but
while
that
particular
provision
of
the
act
does
not
affect
them,
there
is
another
provision
of
the
act
that
applies
to
everybody
whether
the
milk
has
been
transported
in
or
not,
which
prohibits
its
sale
less
than
--
at
less
than
cost
to
the
seller.
mr.
attorney
general
the
seller's
cost.
mr.
attorney
general
there
is
no
party
that
--
official
organization
or
anything
that
fix
the
cost.
they
--
they
just
provide
cost
to
the
seller.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
that's
his
contention
about
the
matter
but
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
not
as
we
see
it,
no,
sir.
the
act
provides
this.
that
no
milk
where
there
imported
into
a
marketing
area
or
not
shall
be
sold
at
less
than
cost
to
the
seller.
that
provision
goes
on
to
state
that
proof
of
cost
to
other
sellers
in
the
marketing
area
shall
constitute
prima
facie
evidence
of
cost
to
the
seller
against
him,
any
action
might
be
taken.
now,
it
might
be
said
that
cost
to
the
seller
is
fixed.
we
say
that
that
is
merely
a
rule
of
evidence
established
by
the
act
in
order
to
permit
the
proper
state
official
or
an
injured
competitor
to
go
into
court
and
establish
some
standard
of
price.
of
course,
it
isn't
conclusive
on
anybody
and
it
can
be
rebutted.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
conceivable,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
so,
local
producers
who
don't
transport
across
county
lines
are
not
left
unaffected
by
the
act.
now
the
--
the
prevailing
price
provisions
don't
affect
them.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
but
the
below
cause
provisions
do
affect
them.
so,
nobody's
left
unregulated
within
marketing
areas.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right,
the
prevailing
price.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
not
against
interstate
commerce,
because
it
applies
equally
to
intrastate
commerce.
any
milk
that's
imported
into
an
area,
whether
it
comes
from
the
state
of
wisconsin
or
whether
it
comes
from,
say
dekalb
county,
tennessee,
shelby
county,
tennessee
is
subject
to
the
same
restriction.
for
that
reason
we
say
that
there
is
no
basis
for
wisconsin's
allegation
that
their
people
are
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
because
it
does
apply
equally
to
all
groups
to
do
such
acts
as
to
bring
themselves
with
any
term.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question,
if
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
if
wisconsin
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
if
they
can
make
the
proper
allegations
as
to
harm,
they
can
do
it.
i
regret
that
--
that
i'm
not
prepared
to
give
your
honor
a
definite
answer
to
that
question
yes
or
no
but
i'm
not.
certainly,
any
citizen
of
wisconsin
who
is
affected
and
who
can
make
proper
allegations
of
harm
has
perfect
right
to
try
to
come
into
a
tennessee
court
and
have
this
act
tested.
there's
no
reason
on
earth
why
he
can't
do
that.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
no
sir,
none
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
it
would.
mr.
attorney
general
i
did
make
that
response
to
your
question.
i'm
not
definite
about
the
state
court.
i
--
i
feel
reasonably
sure
that
wisconsin
on
proper
allegations
could
get
into
the
state
court.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
i
think
the
federal
statute
put
exclusive
jurisdiction
particularly
insofar
as
federal
courts
go
and
this
court
between
--
in
suits
between
states
and
maybe
that
i'm
confused
about
that.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
all
right
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
if
it
please
your
honor,
we
think
the
cases
of
baldwin
against
seelig
and
hood
against
du
mond
do
not
support
the
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
this
case.
there,
there
was
an
unequivocal
barrier
to
the
flow
of
milk
in
interstate
commerce
which
does
not
exist
here.
on
the
question
of
whether
this
statute
is
valid
or
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution,
we
rely
upon
the
cases
of
eisenberg
--
milk
control
board
against
eisenberg
farm
products
wherein
this
court
approved
the
action
of
a
milk
control
board
of
a
state
in
setting
prices
of
milk
that
was
--
prices
that
was
to
be
paid
to
producers
of
milk
in
the
state
even
though
milk
was
to
flow
in
interstate
commerce.
the
same
result
was
reached
in
the
case
of
city
service
gas
company
against
peerless
oil
&
gas
company
wherein
there
this
court
upheld
the
action
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
fixing
prices
for
gas
that
was
to
be
taken
from
a
certain
field
even
though
that
gas
was
to
be
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
those
cases
went
even
further
than
the
statute
in
the
case
at
bar
because
there,
there
was
a
definite
price
fixing
arrangement
where
the
state
of
oklahoma
on
one
hand
and
the
state
of
new
york
on
the
other
hand
said,
"this
shall
be
paid
for
oil
&
gas
and
this
shall
be
paid
for
milk
in
no
less."
there's
a
statement
in
city
service
against
peerless
oil
that
we
think
is
directly
applicable
to
the
situation
at
bar.
this
court
said
that
it's
not
every
incidental
effect
on
the
interstate
commerce
that
will
strike
down
a
state
statute
that
the
states
have
a
right
to
enact
certain
police
regulations
even
though
they
might
have
some
incidental
impact
on
interstate
commerce.
the
requirements
are
that
interstate
commerce
not
be
discriminated
against
we
think
that
test
has
been
made
here
that
there
is
no
undue
burden
on
it.
we
think
that
so
far
as
the
pleadings
here
go,
there
is
no
showing
of
undue
burden.
there's
nothing
on
the
face
of
--
of
the
statute
itself
to
indicate
that
an
undue
burden
will
be
placed
on
it.
and
furthermore,
we
think
that
if
the
safeguards
and
obvious
state
interest
over
which
the
national
interest
if
there
be
any
and
the
prevention
of
all
regulation
does
not
prohibit.
it's
therefore
our
insistence
that
wisconsin
has
no
right
to
maintain
a
suit
that
even
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
its
discretion
should
be
exercised
against
the
filing
of
this
complaint
and
that
lastly,
the
statute
is
not
invalid.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
that's
what
i
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
said.
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
i
was
thinking
about
the
suit
by
wisconsin
against
tennessee
because
i
thought
that
before
the
question
was
directed.
mr.
attorney
general
the
--
the
officials
under
the
tennessee
law?
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
she
could
institute
--
well,
i
started
to
say
a
suit
against
some
private
individual
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
i
can't
conceive
to
state
any
facts
under
this
statute
that
would
give
her
suit
against
a
private
individual.
mr.
attorney
general
i
--
i
was
thinking
about
the
state
of
tennessee
as
being
a
party
defendant
in
response
to
his
honor's
question.
mr.
attorney
general
or
one
of
its
official.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
the
officials
of
tennessee
do
not
expect
to
enforce
this
law
through
their
own
official
action.
and
if
i
may
explain
that
briefly
in
this
respect,
the
statute
gives
to
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
of
the
state
of
tennessee
or
any
aggrieved
party
the
right
to
institute
an
injunction
suit
against
this
--
under
this
statute.
it's
his
policy
--
mr.
attorney
general
against
the
violator.
yes,
sir.
it's
the
policy
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
himself
not
to
institute
the
suit
but
leave
it
to
the
individuals
who
might
be
aggrieved.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
something
that's
up
to
them
individually.
mr.
attorney
general
the
prosecuting
attorneys.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
a
misdemeanor.
the
punishment
is
set
out
in
the
act
--
mr.
attorney
general
you
have
to
catch
him
in
tennessee.
it's
a
misdemeanor
advance,
if
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir,
if
he
violates
the
act.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
it
would
hit
the
man
in
tennessee
if
he
violated
the
statute.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
the
allegations
of
the
bill
are
not
specifically
as
to
that
so
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
i
think
that
he
can
come
in
under
either
the
federal
or
the
state
declaratory
judgement
statute
and
if
he
can
show
a
real
threatened
injury
he
then
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
can
conceive
of
a
threat
if
he
--
mr.
attorney
general
it
was
in
his
discretion
and
power
as
to
whether
he'll
institute
these
injunction
suits
and
he
has
said
that
he
would
not.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
one
way.
i
think
it
can
be
done
under
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
if
a
real
dispute
arises
between
somebody
who
sells
milk
that's
been
transported
from
wisconsin
and
perhaps
a
competitor
in
tennessee
who
is
worrying
that
he
is
being
harmed
by
the
act
of
--
mr.
attorney
general
the
competitor
could
institute
an
injunction
suit
against
the
man
who
is
violating
the
act.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
he
might
be
or
he
might
be
in
tennessee.
it
would
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
in
those
cases,
the
milk
people
who
were
complaining
were
actually
suffering
--
mr.
attorney
general
either
there,
there
is
a
law
by
its
own
terms
prevented
them
from
selling
or
building
a
plan
or
whatever
it
was
they
wanted
to
do.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
the
state
of
wisconsin.
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that,
no
sir.
but
we
say
that
the
issue
here
are
such
that
it
will
be
suited
to
the
framework
of
the
--
of
a
controversy
in
this
court.
and
that
even
if
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
as
a
discretionary
proposition,
anybody
who
is
suffers
because
of
this
act
should
be
relegated
to
the
more
orthodox
procedure
where
those
matters
can
be
determined.
mr.
attorney
general
under
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
it
might
not
be
necessary
to
go
far
enough
to
risk
a
violation
of
the
law.
however,
in
united
public
workers
against
mitchell
this
court
held
that
the
only
people
who
had
a
right
maintain
that
suit
were
the
ones
who
had
violated
the
law
and
not
those
who
expressed
a
desire
to
violate
it.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
merely
a
statement
of
his
policy,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
attorney
general
he
just
doesn't
think
that
the
department
of
agriculture
has
any
business
in
getting
involved
in
matters
of
this
kind.
mr.
attorney
general
the
legislature
didn't
say
that
he
should.
it
said
that
he
might.
he
was
given
power
but
no
duty
was
imposed
on
him
to
do
it
if
he
didn't
see
fit
to.
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
think
that
would
be
enough.
no,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
at
least
to
go
on
and
allege
that
what
he
proposed
to
do
was
some
act
that
this
state
--
that
this
statute
made
a
violation.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
yes
sir
i
am.
would
the
court
give
us
permission
to
brief
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
state
of
wisconsin
could
maintain
such
a
suit
in
a
state
court
in
tennessee
against
the
state
of
tennessee?
mr.
attorney
general
thank
you
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
there
were
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
very
well,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
very
well.
mr.
attorney
general
very
well
sir.
thank
you,
sir.
