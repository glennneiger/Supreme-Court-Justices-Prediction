justice

frankfurter
are
there
any
relief
for
such
a
milk
producer
of
wisconsin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
filed
into
the
commerce
clause,
it
would
(inaudible)
that
in
light
of
this
not
to
be
in
the
penalty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
cheese
making
of
which
(inaudible)
is
that
--
is
that
a
part
of
the
dairy
industry?
is
that
a
separate
industry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
said
the
second
(inaudible)
to
include
cheese
and
butter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
--
all
these
butter
is
coming
from.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
law
affect
cheese?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
is
part
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
statute
is
so
obviously
unconstitutional,
why
do
we
expend
so
verdantly?
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
file
a
bill,
a
motion
to
dismiss,
motion
denied,
injunction,
why
is
that
so
burdensome?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
--
except
the
general
burden
with
any
litigations
obviously.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
take
cases
from
district
courts
on
very
short
notice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
and
constitutional
questions.
i
merely
meant
that
monetarily
the
statute
on
its
face
is
obvious
--
is
it
obviously
unconstitutional,
isn't
very
--
is
the
cause
of
litigation,
all
the
--
all
that
the
court
would
have
to
do
is
to
read
the
statute
(inaudible)
and
if
it
isn't
that
kind
of
a
case,
if
it's
a
different
kind
of
a
(inaudible)
down
the
commerce
clause,
it
depends
on
detailed
facts,
it
has
to
be
ascertained
that
the
(inaudible)
case
from
indiana.
if
you
require
it,
it
should've
been
--
it's
better
there's
no
place
to
have
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
cannot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general,
there
is
an
allegation
as
there
are
12
of
the
proposed
complaints
with
the
(inaudible)
wisconsin
have
been
and
sold
in
tennessee
and
as
such
there
is
(inaudible)
hamper
and
impede
to
destroy
it,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
that
is
sufficiently
particular?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
there's
--
how
could
you
have
in
the
state
of
the
28
of
the
millions
(inaudible)
59
million
pounds
of
milk
shipped,
(inaudible)
in
tennessee
where
they
said
that.
they
haven't
said
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
speaking
against
the
complaint.
we're
not
speaking
against
some
complaint
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
pennsylvania
itself
was
a
consumer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
state
itself
was
a
consumer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
would
have
a
very
different
case
if
wisconsin
as
was
true
of
north
dakota
(inaudible)
for
themselves,
engaged
in
the
milk
business,
(inaudible)
if
you
own
warehouses
and
(inaudible)
activities
as
a
proprietor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
have
a
very
different
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
--
i'm
assuming
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
it's
possible
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
--
there
are
(inaudible)
that
were
more
important
state
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
that,
i
don't
understand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
happened
in
missouri
against
massachusetts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
(inaudible)
familiar
with
the
case
which
it
says
that
the
original
jurisdiction
is
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
this
court
and
not
a
compulsion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
were
evidently
under
the
(inaudible)
you
make
the
assumption
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
read
article
iii
and
(inaudible)
to
see
whether
it
would
have
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
but
it
isn't
so
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
isn't
merely
what
you
(inaudible)
massachusetts
against
missouri
(inaudible)
the
case
which
has
come
to
this
court
from
california,
or
a
suit
was
brought
in
the
district
court.
the
argument
was
--
it
must
be
brought
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
(inaudible)
these
are
non-agricultural
members
of
this
court
(inaudible)
does
that
mean
that
a
farmer
or
dairy
man
in
tennessee
complaining
against
undue
or
unfair
competition,
wisconsin
(inaudible)
could
bring
a
suit
against
that
in
wisconsin
in
a
court
as
though
your
commissioner
of
agriculture
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
--
there
are
--
there
is
penal
sanction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
if
anybody
(inaudible)
the
violation
of
the
statutes
shall
be
guilty
of
misdemeanor
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
is
this
--
how
does
a
tennessee
man
go
against
a
wisconsin
importer
into
a
tennessee
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
go
against
any
of
the
local
distributor
for
wisconsin
dairy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
suppose
(inaudible)
suppose
a
lot
of
milk
needed
in
wisconsin
(inaudible)
the
distributor
in
tennessee
whatever
the
equivalent
in
the
statute
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
the
normal
course
of
business
of
milk
coming
in
wisconsin
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
don't
have
to
be
very
hypothetical
about
this,
this
court
have
had
a
number
of
(inaudible)
of
this
nature
dealing
with
milk
coming
up
in
various
states
complaining
against
the
same
kind
of
barriers
by
state
laws
against
interstate
commerce
and
they
went
to
either
federal
or
state
courts
in
those
states
and
then
came
here
under
a
challenge
that
the
state
statute
would
violate
the
commerce
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
a
(inaudible)
if
this
is
invalid
and
all
these
suits
should've
been
brought
by
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
would
it
be
true
to
say
they
are
barred
from
entering
tennessee
although
the
commerce
clause
permits
them
to
enter
tennessee.
you
don't
need
any
more
of
the
dairy
(inaudible)
if
you
got
that
kind
of
a
case.
i
think
it
goes
to
your
court
and
(inaudible)
bearing
a
judgment.
the
federal
court
could
enter
a
declaration.
that's
what
happened
in
those
cases.
(inaudible)
respectively
that
new
york
and
pennsylvania
passed
statutes
dealing
with
the
milk
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
would
show
you
that
they
would
be
heard
hypothetically
but
immediately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
preparation
of
your
brief.
you
indicated
or
(inaudible).
there
are
two
questions
here.
one,
the
question
of
the
exclusiveness
of
this
court
as
the
forum
where
it's
supervise
the
state,
that's
one
question
having
to
do
with
the
distribution
of
jurisdiction
of
article
iii.
but
there's
another
question,
very
different,
wholly
different
on
whether
or
rather
when
wisconsin
may
sue
either
in
tennessee
or
in
a
district
court
or
here
mainly,
whether
there's
a
right
litigation
which
you've
started
out
or
arguing
about,
according
to
the
rules
of
this
court,
you
must
have
a
really
large
action,
existing
litigation
by
a
claimant
who
is
hurt,
who
is
not
just
generally
wanting
to
get
a
declaration
from
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional.
and
they're
very
different
questions
because
the
lack
of
(inaudible)
existing
likelihood,
concrete
litigation,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
whether
this
court
is
exclusive
(inaudible)
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
find
this
court
as
much
as
(inaudible)
as
it
does
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
happen
to
know
why
that
(inaudible)
filed
in
april?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
--
still
to
enjoin
a
statute
on
constitutional
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general,
am
i
under
a
misapprehension
in
assuming
the
dean
--
milk
cooperative
in
wisconsin
is
a
rather
large
organization
with
considerable
methods?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
considerable
larger
--
