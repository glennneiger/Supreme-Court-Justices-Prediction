mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
motion
by
the
state
of
wisconsin
for
leave
to
file
a
complaint
in
an
original
action
against
the
state
of
tennessee.
the
motion
proposed
complaint
and
brief
were
served
upon
the
proper
officials
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
of
that
state
on
the
14th,
of
october
1955.
no
answer
or
other
pleading
has
been
served
by
the
state
of
tennessee
except
a
brief,
which
was
served
and
filed
and
which
we
construe
in
the
nature
of
a
demurrer
to
our
proposed
complaint.
we
believe
the
jurisdiction
is
conferred
on
this
court
by
article
3
section
2,
clause
2
because
it
is
an
action
in
which
one
of
the
sovereign
states
is
a
party.
in
this
action,
both
parties
are
sovereign
states
and
we
believe
that
section
1251
(a)
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
gives
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
this
proposed
action
to
this
honorable
body.
the
principal
question
involved
in
this
proposed
action
is,
does
a
tennessee
statute
which
allows
residence
of
a
marketing
area
in
tennessee
to
sell
milk
and
milk
products
below
a
prevailing
price
without
restriction,
but
subjects
the
residence
of
a
--
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
a
thread
of
prosecution
if
they
make
sales
below
said
prevailing
price
constitute
a
direct
and
undue
burden
upon
interstate
commerce?
it
is
our
position
that
it
does.
we
believe
that
it
is
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce
and
hence
violative
of
the
commerce
clause,
article
1,
section
8,
clause
3,
and
also
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution,
article
14,
section
1.
the
controversy
arose
as
a
result
of
the
passage
in
the
state
of
tennessee
of
public
law
74
of
1955.
in
this
act,
it
provides
in
substance
that
any
person
who
shall
sell
milk
or
milk
products
in
any
marketing
area
for
a
less
than
the
wholesale
or
retail
price
at
the
place
of
sale,
when
such
milk
has
been
prepared
or
processed
for
resale
and
transported
into
the
marketing
area
from
any
point
outside
of
the
marketing
area
has
committed
a
proscribed
act.
a
shortened
quotation
from
paragraph
a
of
public
act
74
describes
the
unlawful
act
as
follows"
to
sell
within
any
marketing
area
at
wholesale
or
retail
for
less
than
the
prevailing
wholesale
or
retail
price
at
the
place
of
sale
any
of
the
following
named
products,
market
milk.
and
then
they
enumerate
all
various
kinds
of
fluid
milk,
butter
milk
and
cream
that
have
been
prepared
or
processed
for
resale
and
have
been
transported
in
the
said
marketing
area
from
any
point
outside
of
said
marketing
area".
anyone
violating
the
provisions
of
public
law
74
will
be
subjected
to
penalties
up
to
$300
or
by
imprisonment
not
to
exceed
three
months
or
by
both,
such
imprisonment
and
fine.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
that
this
law,
the
mere
passage
of
this
law
creates
a
barrier
to
the
free
flow
of
milk
from
the
state
of
wisconsin
into
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
additional
prescription
in
this
act
permits
an
injunctional
proceeding
by
the
commissioner
of
agriculture.
so,
with
the
passage
of
this
act,
the
milk
producers
in
wisconsin
are
faced
with
injunction
and
prosecution
if
they
transport
milk
into
the
state
of
tennessee
and
attempt
to
sell
it
competitively
in
that
state.
this
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
apparently,
there
is
no
relief
except
to
comply
with
the
law
or
engage
in
the
expensive
litigation
in
that
particular
jurisdiction.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
mr.
justice,
that
is
why
we
are
in
this
court.
this
is
a
matter
of
great
importance,
this
free
interstate
commerce
in
milk
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
to
the
thousands
of
milk
producers
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
second
greatest
industry
in
wisconsin
is
the
dairy
industry.
we
produce
tremendous
quantities
of
milk
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
law,
substantial
quantities
of
milk
produced
have
been
sold
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
in
the
state
of
wisconsin,
there
are
107,000
farm
families
engaged
in
the
production
of
milk,
and
in
1954,
the
state
of
wisconsin
produced
16.5
billion
pounds
of
milk.
in
addition
to
that,
we
exported
from
the
state
of
wisconsin
more
than
1
billion
pounds
of
milk.
this
industry
is
vital
to
the
state
of
wisconsin.
the
export
of
this
milk,
we
have
a
tremendous
reservoir
of
milk
available
to
the
people
of
america
if
we
are
not
prevented
by
a
maze
of
discriminatory
statutes
and
regulations
and
barriers
from
moving
it
freely
in
interstate
commerce.
those
107,000
farm
families
in
wisconsin
have
more
than
2,600,000
producing
dairy
cattle
and
more
than
4
million
cattle
on
their
farms.
the
value
of
this
milk
exceeds
$500
million.
and
the
total
volume
of
butter
fat
in
addition
to
that
milk
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
out
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
1954
exceeded
28.5
million
pounds.
so,
this
industry
is
vital
to
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
free
flow
of
this
milk
is
essential
to
prevent
the
depression
of
dairy
prices
in
our
state
if
this
milk
is
not
permitted
to
move
freely.
and
now
we're
faced
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
it
is
required
to
be
processed
under
the
public
health
laws
and
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
raw
milk
would
not
come
under
this
act,
and
to
properly
move
it,
it
has
to
be
pasteurized.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
the
law
exempts
the
producer
but
imposes
restraints
which
are
unreasonable
upon
him
because
the
individual
producer
doesn't
have
adequate
volume
or
adequate
finance
to
move
milk
in
a
volume
necessary
for
economical
transportation.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
our
processors
in
wisconsin
are
principally
large
cooperative
farm
organizations
who
gather
the
milk,
process
it
and
transport
it
or
sell
it
outside
of
the
state
as
well
as
within
our
jurisdiction.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
individual
litigants
could
go
down
there.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
individual
processors
could
go
down
there.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
that
is
correct.
but
we
are
appearing
here
as
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
under
the
doctrine
parens
patriae
to
represent
the
107,000
farm
producers
who
have
neither
the
adequate
finance
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
it
directly
affects
the
farmer
if
the
processor
can't
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
it
is
through
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
and
it
affects
the
producer
if
his
processor
can't
move
his
milk.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
we
feel
it's
quite
a
direct
affect
because
if
the
processor
can't
move
it,
the
price
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
illinois
versus
missouri?
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
we
are
relying
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
we're
relying
on
pennsylvania
versus
west
virginia.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
the
court
permitted
the
filing
of
the
complaint
under
the
doctrine
of
parens
patriae
as
we
understand
it
in
that
case.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
they
alleged
they
were
owner
of
buildings
and
schools
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
and
of
course,
we
alleged
that
this
has
a
direct
impact
on
the
tax
revenues
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
that
our
milk
is
not
permitted
to
flow
freely
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
we
also
alleged
that
we
suffer
through
the
tax
revenues
and
the
depressed
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
--
conditions.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
in
the
case
of
georgia
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroads,
the
court
said
there
that
the
proprietary
allegation
was
more
or
less
of
a
makeweight
--
a
makeweight
argument
and
that
they
would
permit
the
state
to
come
into
this
court
under
the
doctrine
of
parens
patriae.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
georgia
versus
tennessee
copper
company,
we
feel
that
this
is
a
very
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
we
think
the
legal
issue
that
we
represent
the
people
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
even
though
they
may
be
few
that
directly
suffer,
but
in
this
case,
many
are
suffering.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
i
think
we
have
that
right
under
that
doctrine.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
it's
a
very
essential
part
of
the
dairy
industry.
it's
a
manufacturing
phase
of
the
industry.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
yes,
cheese
and
butter,
and
fluid
milk.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
in
fact,
it
is
a
very
essential
part
of
the
dairy
industry.
wisconsin
makes
more
cheese
than
all
of
the
other
states
in
the
union
together.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
they
have
a
--
tennessee
has
a
separate
licensing
law
which
affects
manufactured
products.
this
is
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
this
is
directed
principally
to
the
fluid
milk.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
we
construe
it
to
mean
the
right
of
the
state
to
appear
for
the
substantial
interest
of
the
people
of
the
state.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
any
substantial
interest
that
affects
the
rights
or
the
economy
of
the
state,
the
rights
of
the
individual
people
or
the
economy
of
the
state.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
mr.
justice,
the
tennessee
brief
alludes
to
our
pending
action
which
was
initiated
by
a
foreign
corporation
which
is
a
processor
of
milk
and
which
is
now
in
trouble
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
but
it
was
a
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
mr.
justice,
that
is
the
position
of
wisconsin
that
we
shouldn't
be
dependent
on
the
benevolence
of
some
private
individual
or
foreign
corporation
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
people
of
wisconsin
where
a
statute
directly
burdens
interstate
commerce.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
have
no
familiarity
with
the
case
except
that
it
was
made
a
part
of
the
brief
of
the
state
of
tennessee
and
i
am
confident
that
it
involves
other
issues
in
which
that
processor
may
be
interested
other
than
the
issue
of
interstate
commerce
in
which
we
are
principally
interested
here
and
the
discriminatory
features
of
the
tennessee
act.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
possibly
not
any
trade
barrier,
i
can
conceive
of
some
that
would
not.
but
we
think
that
this
is
a
barrier,
a
real
barrier
and
a
direct
barrier
against
the
free
flow
of
milk
between
our
state
and
the
state
of
tennessee.
we
have
pleaded
these
ultimate
facts
and
none
of
them
have
been
denied
by
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
we
believe
that
these
facts
bring
into
our
operation
the
rules
of
law
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
decision
in
pennsylvania
versus
west
virginia.
one
significant
part
of
that
case
was
the
fact
that
pennsylvania
started
suit
only
eight
days
after
the
passage
of
the
law
in
west
virginia,
and
this
court
entertained
that
suit
against
the
--
we
cited
to
show
that
this
action
was
brought
timely
because
this
court
has
entertained
these
actions
when
they
were
brought
before
any
injury
has
been
done
and
the
court
said
that
the
injured
state
did
not
need
to
wait
until
injury
had
been
done
but
when
the
statute
was
clearly
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
that
this
court
would
step
in
and
provide
a
remedy.
and
we
also
think
that
that
doctrine
is
set
forth
in
the
case
of
georgia
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad
which
as
we
understand
that
case,
accepted
jurisdiction
on
the
theory
of
parens
patriae
and
not
on
the
theory
that
the
state
of
georgia
had
a
particularly
or
real
proprietary
interest.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
mr.
justice.
possibly,
that
was
a
case
that
was
for
the
benefit
of
private
individuals
and
not
for
the
sovereign
state.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
what
we
feel
in
this
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
but
the
citizen
cannot
get
the
relief
without
being
burdened
with
expensive
cost
of
litigation
in
a
court,
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction,
and
the
law
--
the
mere
passage
of
this
act
has
effectively
prevented
it,
the
movement
of
milk
in
interstate
commerce
between
wisconsin
and
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
burden
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
we
think
it's
an
undue
burden.
we
don't
think
there's
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
--
ambiguity
in
the
statute
at
all.
it
will
take
a
long
time
to
get
the
action
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
if
it
comes
up
through
the
process
of
starting
in
the
district
court,
coming
up
to
the
supreme
court,
we
think
it
is
direct
and
real,
and
present
and
it
should
be
--
relief
should
granted.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
true.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
mr.
justice,
we
--
we
of
course
feel
that
milk
is
a
legitimate
article
to
move
in
interstate
commerce.
we
feel
that
the
doctrine
of
baldwin
versus
seelig
established
that
fact.
we
also
think
that
the
doctrine
must
--
is
repeated
in
the
dean
milk
company
case
versus
the
city
of
madison,
wherein
madison
had
an
ordinance
that
required
pasteurization
of
that
milk
within
a
radius
of
25
miles
of
the
city
of
madison,
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
discriminatory
against
interstate
commerce
and
that
it
--
even
though
it
discriminated
against
some
of
the
people
residing
in
the
jurisdiction,
that
it
was
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore,
it
was
struck
down.
a
similar
rule
was
ruling
in
the
case
of
hood
versus
du
mond
which
we
think
supports
our
position
of
--
that
this
burden
in
this
particular
case
is
a
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
it
is
outside
of
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
and
thus
discriminate
against
the
people
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
they
have
further
burden
placed
on
interstate
commerce
in
this
act,
which
requires
that
the
milk
must
be
sold
in
tennessee
at
not
less
than
cost.
and
then,
they
described
cost
as
the
cost
to
the
producer
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
it
is
our
contention,
and
if
we
have
the
opportunity
to
present
this
matter
to
this
court
that
we
can
more
efficiently
produce
that
milk
and
that
it
--
that
their
cost
factor
is
a
direct
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
so,
we
have
this
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
mr.
justice,
we
can't,
the
state
of
wisconsin
can't
sue
tennessee
in
any
court
but
this
court.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
as
i
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
as
i
understand
the
constitution
and
the
code
requires
that
this
court
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
actions
between
sovereign
states.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
the
dean
milk
company
operates
in
wisconsin.
it
is
not
a
producer
of
milk.
it
is
a
processor
and
distributor
of
milk.
it's
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
it's
a
foreign
corporation.
it's
been
the
subject
of
prosecution
for
the
state
of
wisconsin.
we
think
the
issues
are
so
different
in
that
case.
we
think
that
we
--
there
are
so
many
provisions
against
the
state
appearing
in
that
case
that
we
appealed
to
this
court
to
take
original
jurisdiction
of
--
of
this
situation
and
we
think
this
is
the
only
place
that
we
have
a
forum.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
i
think
it
--
that
was
a
direct
and
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
that
they
probably
could.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
that's
why
we
are
here
in
this
action.
it
is
our
position
that
these
sanctions
enacted
by
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
threats
of
prosecution,
the
threats
of
injunctional
action
have
created
a
real
barrier
which
hamper
and
impede,
and
will
eventually
destroy
the
commerce
in
milk
between
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
we
have
appealed
to
this
court
as
the
only
court
that
has
jurisdiction
of
this
action
and
the
hope
that
we
may
be
permitted
to
file
our
complaint
under
the
doctrine
of
parens
patriae
and
be
heard
in
this
court.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
tennessee
apparently
isn't
aware
of
the
fact
if
the
director
of
agriculture
of
the
state
of
tennessee
has
placed
him
a
mail
and
sent
to
the
processors
of
milk,
shipping
milk
into
the
state
of
tennessee
a
copy
of
public
law
74
which
we
are
here
discussing
without
comment
what
the
processor
felt
the
clear
implication
of
that
notice
was
that
the
state
of
tennessee
did
intend
to
enforce
the
law
against
people
who
attempted
to
deliver
milk
into
the
state
of
tennessee.
it
was
our
position
in
our
plea
for
right
to
file
a
complaint
here
that
speed
is
one
of
the
reasons
--
expeditious
relief
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
granting
a
litigant
the
right
to
come
in
parens
patriae
and
represent
their
people.
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
large
number
of
people
in
the
state
and
the
impact
on
the
economy
of
the
state
the
delay
would
affect
the
dean
milk
company
did
begin
litigating
with
the
state
of
tennessee
in
april
of
1955.
and
that
case
is
still
in
the
district
court
of
the
state
of
tennessee
and
there's
no
reason
for
us
to
believe
but
what
if
the
dean
milk
company
can
find
markets
elsewhere
that
they
will
withdraw
from
their
attempt
to
go
into
the
state
of
tennessee
and
abandon
their
lawsuit
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
the
processor
in
this
particular
type
of
industry
stands
between
the
producer
and
the
ultimate
consumer
and
his
interest
may
not
coincide
with
the
interest
of
the
producer
in
getting
his
milk
into
the
hands
of
consumers.
and
therefore,
we
feel
that
it
is
vital
that
the
matter
be
considered
in
this
court
and
not
make
us
depend.
not
make
all
of
the
producers
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
depend
on
the
interest
of
some
producer
to
take
action
in
the
state
of
tennessee
to
litigate
that
question.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
it's
filed
in
april
of
1955.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
i
have
no
information
mr.
justice
but
i
am
well
aware
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
excuse
me.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
yes.
a
three-judge
court
has
now
been
ordered
i
understand
to
here
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
i'm
just
advised
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
well,
that's
--
mine
is
hearsay
also
but
i
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
the
state
of
tennessee
has
threatened
enforcement.
we
feel
that
it
is
discriminatory
both
by
requiring
us
to
sell
at
the
prevailing
market
price
and
there's
no
definition
of
what
it
is
and
also
requiring
us
to
sell
at
not
below
cost
which
is
a
cost
determined
by
the
producers
in
the
state
of
tennessee
which
may
be
entirely
different
from
the
efficient
production
cost
that
can
be
obtain
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
and
we
feel
and
we
will
brief
this
but
we
had
relied
on
title
28
section
1251
which
says,
paragraph
a,
"the
supreme
court
shall
have
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
all
controversies
between
two
or
more
states."
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
they
vary
in
size
mr.
justice.
some
of
them
are
small
some
of
them
are
very
--
mr.
vernon
w.
thomson
there
are
some
very
sizable
cooperatives.
