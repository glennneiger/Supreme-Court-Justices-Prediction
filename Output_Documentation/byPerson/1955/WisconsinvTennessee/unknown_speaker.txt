unknown
speaker
of
course,
you
have
probably
had
smoke
right
over
into
tennessee
or
the
poison
gas.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
i
had
in
mind
was
the
same
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
against
another
state.
unknown
speaker
now,
substantial
--
it
might
be
anything
from
--
i
don't
know
what,
a
thousand
pounds
or
500
pounds
or
10,000.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
about
pennsylvania
against
west
virginia?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
(inaudible)
proprietary
in
some
other
angle,
isn't
it?
then
you
would
have
to
face
georgia
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
that
is
--
i
was
thinking
about
the
other
face
of
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
--
do
the
officials
of
tennessee
expect
to
enforce
this
law?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
against
the
violator
--
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
do
i
understand
that
the
test
is
that
tennessee
courts,
state
or
federal,
would
it
be
necessary
for
the
wisconsin
shipper
the
(inaudible)
to
violate
the
tennessee
law
and
be
prosecuted
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
is
not
a
threat
to
prosecute
him.
unknown
speaker
i
--
i
can
say
that
there
would
be
a
threat.
but
i
understand
that
--
that
that's
entirely
within
the
power
of
the
commissioner
of
agriculture
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
in
the
discretion
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
as
to
whether
he
will
institute
any
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
--
how
does
it
going
to
be
tested
in
a
tennessee
court?
have
a
violation
of
the
law
then
depend
on
the
ground
that
it's
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
doesn't
do
anything
about,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
that
man
in
wisconsin?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
those
cases
though.
those
were
all
violations
that
took
place
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
should
be
in
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
--
for
instance,
the
violation
in
wisconsin
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
actually
suffering
and
actually
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
--
but
the
fact
that
your
private
litigants
can
sue
isn't
an
answer
to
this
central
problem
it
seems
to
me.
whether
or
not
the
state
may
also
true
--
whether
or
not
the
state
has
--
i
know
you
maintain
the
state
has
the
--
it
doesn't
have
substantial
interest
here
compared
to
(inaudible)
but
--
i
mean
this
was
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
in
the
--
in
the
water
rights
cases,
the
interstate
water
rights
cases,
those
issues
could
be
focused
in
private
litigations,
being
the
downstream
owners
of
riparian
rights,
upstream
owners.
the
fact
that
they
can
sue
doesn't
mean
that
the
states
involved
may
not
also.
unknown
speaker
i
--
i
could
follow
that
if
i
could
understand
as
to
how
they
would
get
that
settled
without
risking
the
violation
of
the
law,
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
i
don't
quite
understand
just
what
you
think
would
be
necessary
to
authorize
filing
a
suit
in
tennessee.
of
course
if
the
court
has
a
discretionary
duty
(inaudible)
right
that
it
had
with
him
to
decline.
that
discretion
might
be
exercised
under
some
circumstances
not
under
others.
it
might
--
therefore,
it
might
be
that
the
right
to
sue
somewhere
else.
suppose
we'd
first
take
a
dairy
man
from
wisconsin.
suppose
he
went
down
and
then
said
now,
i've
been
shipping
business
in
milk
(inaudible)
i
want
to
continue
it
because
i
want
to
start
--
ship
milk
into
the
market
and
sell
them
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
(inaudible)
but
i'm
afraid
shipping
in
because
--
(inaudible)
your
prosecuting
officers
are
charged
with
(inaudible)
then
you
might
prosecute
me
every
time
i
ship
something
in.
and
he
filed
a
suit
and
said
no
more
than
that
in
your
state
court.
could
he
--
would
your
court
take
jurisdiction
of
any
kind
of
suit,
test
that
law
on
his
allegations
that
the
law
violates
the
commerce
clause.
unknown
speaker
is
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
enough
to
say
that
he
wants
to
do
business
there.
that
the
law
is
outstanding
and
that
the
duty
is
on
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
prosecute
him
so
that
he
couldn't
do
that.
well,
how
could
he
do
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course
he
said
that.
would
that
authorize
him
to
challenge
it
in
your
court?
unknown
speaker
suppose,
instead
of
a
--
it
being
the
(inaudible)
the
state
came
down,
said
there
are
many,
many
people
out
there
who
wants
to
do
business.
we've
come
down
and
we
are
authorized
on
our
state
law
to
file
a
suit
for
them.
and
they
allege
that
they
had
all
these
people
who
wants
to
come
in
tennessee
and
the
--
that
(inaudible)
prosecuting
attorney
does
(inaudible)
of
prosecution
and
that
the
--
their
sales
would
violate
your
law.
and
if
your
law
violates
the
commerce
clause
would
you
still
say
you
aren't
certain
whether
the
state
could
file
that
suit?
unknown
speaker
i
would
suggest
--
unknown
speaker
--
if
you
look
at
several
suits
that
--
cases
that
haven't
been
referred
to
either
brief
at
all,
i
don't
know
how
you
missed
them.
one
of
them
is
missouri
against
massachusetts
and
the
other
is
the
(inaudible)
united
states
against
the
belt
railroad
of
california.
if
there
were
(inaudible)efforts
have
been
made
to
file
claims
here
by
states
and
it's
been
indicated
for
(inaudible)
suits
could
be
filed
either
in
the
state
court
or
in
the
federal
district
court
if
the
state
courts
were
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
--
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
will
you
permit
me
to
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
touch
also
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
need
not
be
printed.
unknown
speaker
the
possibility
of
the
--
one
of
the
shippers
in
this
(inaudible)
without
violation
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
1955.
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
burden
of
the
document
in
that
court
is
--
is
especially
heavy
or
whether
for
one
reason
or
other,
the
parties
didn't
bring
it
down
or
it
couldn't
be
brought
out?
unknown
speaker
a
three-judge
court.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
