mr.
samuel
r.
howell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
state
at
the
outset
that
the
statement
to
which
counsel
has
just
referred
in
the
commission's
brief
from
page
18
which
had
indicate
that
the
commission
is
basing
its
decision
on
the
short
holding
provision
of
the
section
15
(4)
is
an
inadvertence
and
the
commission
does
not
rely
upon
the
short
holding
or
circuitous
routing
of
this
traffic
at
all
in
reaching
its
decision
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
barge
lines
filed
a
petition
with
the
commission
for
reconsideration
of
division
3's
action
which
found
that
there
was
no
discrimination
under
section
3
(4),
and
therefore,
and
that
there
have
been
no
showing
of
any
evidence
that
the
barge
lines
--
that
there
should
be
through
routes
and
joint
rates
established
between
the
barge
lines
and
the
railroads
in
the
public
interest.
and
so,
the
barge
lines
in
asking
the
commission
--
for
commission
to
reconsider
the
action
of
division
5,
asked
that
the
only
--
ask
that
only
with
respect
to
section
3
(4).
and
the
entire
commission
only
considered
the
petition
for
reconsideration
under
section
3
(4).
and
on
the
--
when
this
case
was
brought
into
the
district
court
by
the
barge
lines,
the
barge
lines
only
asked
for
a
review
of
the
commission's
order
under
section
3
(4)
and
nothing
else
and
the
--
and
the
case
was
considered
by
the
district
court
under
3
(4).
and
on
--
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
the
barge
lines
here,
the
only
alleged
discrimination
is
under
section
3
(4).
the
department
of
justice's
brief,
the
department
of
--
rather,
the
united
state
--
brief
of
the
united
states
discusses
the
section
307
(d)
issue
and
that
is
not
even
involved
in
the
case.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
united
states
haven't
filed
no
jurisdictional
statement,
but
merely
filed
a
motion,
it's
the
first
time
it
has
got
in
the
case
at
all,
were
filing
a
motion
or
rather
a
brief
in
opposition
to
the
commission's
motion
to
affirm.
therefore,
the
--
it
would
not
be
having
the
standing
to
raise
the
question
of
the
section
307
(d)
matter.
but
that
--
that's
beside
the
point.
the
main
thing
that
i
wanted
to
get
to
talk
about
now
is
the
question
of
division,
which
counsel
for
the
barge
lines
discussed
in
his
argument.
and
he
made
one
--
counsel
made
one
statement
that
deserves
some
attention.
he
said,
“that
services
from
east
st.louis
to
danville,
over
the
rail
route
was
identical
on
x
barge
as
an
x
rail
track.”
now,
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
would
support
that
statement.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
physically,
they
would
be
identical,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
the
only
difference
would
be
of
course
in
the
exchanging
of
cars
at
the
--
in
the
terminal
yards
at
east
st.louis,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
it
was
more
difficult
to
transport
x
barge
sulphur
or
--
i
mean,
x
rail
sulphur
to
the
next
barge.
there
is
no
evidence
on
the
record,
and
the
--
and
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
that's
right,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i'll
answer,
your
honor
in
this
way,
that
these
barge
lines
charged
a
violation
--
discrimination
in
violation
of
section
3
(4).
they
did
not
present
any
evidence
that
would
sustain
a
violation
of
section
3
(4)
and
the
commission
so
found.
if
they
--
before
they
could
establish
a
discrimination
under
section
3
(4),
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
them
and
the
burden
rested
upon
them
to
show
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
transportation
conditions,
and
they
didn't
do
it
at
east
st.louis.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
of
course,
and
the
commission
could
not
just
assume
that
there,
the
conditions
were
similar
because
there
might
well
have
been
difference
in
the
conditions
but
that
was
not
shown
in
the
record.
and
so,
they
cannot
now
say
that
there's
--
that
the
service
is
--
is
identical
or
that
the
transportation
condition
is
--
is
not
dissimilar
in
any
manner.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
it's
not
relevant
to
the
establishment
of
through
routes
and
joint
rates,
but
it's
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
railroads
had
discriminated
against
the
--
the
barge
lines
in
the
matter
of
collecting
a
smaller
rate
--
no,
i
mean
the
smaller
rate,
but
insisting
on
the
--
their
$2.95
local
rate
while
accepting
something
a
little
less
in
the
manner
of
divisions.
and
i
want
to
get
--
that
leads
me
into
the
question
of
division.
now,
i'd
like
to
answer
the
question
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
into
danville
at
all.
i
want
to
explain
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that
fact
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
is
not
disputed
in
the
record.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
witness
testified
that
the
amount
of
the
division
was
less,
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
how
much
less.
now
--
now
this
leads
me
to
the
question
of
the
divisions
of
(voice
overlap).
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
the
record
doesn't
show
that
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
if
your
honor
please,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
and
i
can
only
--
of
course
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
generally?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
believe
it's
the
position
of
the
commission
that
the
question
of
division
is
a
private
contract
between
the
railroads
or
between
carriers.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
if
the
court
please,
i'm
not
--
i
think
that
i
did
read
the
case
recently
and
that
case
is
in
court
now,
as
i
understand
it,
brought
by
the
counsel
for
the
barge
lines.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
on
the
holding
of
the
icc.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
the
commission
has
held
that
the
--
i
was
answering,
your
honor,
that
the
commission
has
held
that
the
--
that
a
division
of
a
rate
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
rate.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
and
they
hold
that
it
--
the
only
case
i
know
of
where
that
was
done
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
they
held
that
it
was
--
that
they
would
not
--
they
refused
to
issue
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
require
the
railroad
witness
to
bring
in
evidence
as
to
what
its
divisions
was
with
somebody
else.
now,
that
--
that
is
in
the
--
that
is
in
one
case
and
that's
the
only
case
i
know
anything
about,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
they
weren't
asked
to
bring
it
in
here,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
i
mean,
here,
the
--
no
subpoena
was
asked
of
the
railroads
involved
in
this
case
to
bring
in
the
evidence
like
they
did
in
the
beginning.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
rule
of
the
commission
is
with
respect
to
that,
except
as
--
as
i
found
in
that,
in
the
case
which
i
mentioned
and
that
is
the
cases
now
in
court
and
is
subject
to
judicial
review
and
another
proceeding
in
a
--
in
one
of
the
lower
courts.
now,
i
--
i'm
--
i
understand
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
commission
that
though
--
that
the
private
agreements
between
railroads
is
not
a
matter
that
has
any
effect
or
influence
upon
the
--
the
manner
of
making
rates.
and
therefore,
it
is
not
relevant
to
the
issue
and
that
they
do
not
require
the
--
they
consider
that
evidence
as
being
immaterial.
now,
in
regard
to
the
appellant's
contention
that
the
appellee
railroads
violates
section
3
(4)
by
accepting
a
division
of
an
--
of
an
all-rail
joint
rate
which
is
less
than
the
rate
at
which
they
carry
to
danville,
sulphur
that
has
been
brought
to
--
by
barge
east
st.louis.
we
submit
that
under
the
--
under
that
theory
that
a
division
of
the
joint
rate,
all-rail
rate
would
be
the
same
thing
as
a
rate
or
charge
which
may
be
compared
with
and
treated
the
same
as
a
published
rate
or
charge
paid
by
a
shipper.
and
a
division
of
a
rate
is
not
a
rate.
it
is
not
a
charge
with
which
the
shipper
would
be
concerned,
because
the
shipper
is
only
concerned
with
the
--
with
the
amount
that
it
takes,
the
amount
he
has
to
pay
to
transport
his
property
from
one
point
to
another
point.
he
doesn't
care
whether
the
--
the
--
a
railroad
gets
a
certain
amount
of
--
in
the
form
of
division
from
b
railroad,
and
that
is
no
--
no
concern
to
him
unless
it
would
have
some
effect
upon
the
--
the
total
amount
he
had
to
pay.
and
that
--
and
the
divisions
do
not
influence
or
have
any
effect
upon
the
amount
that
the
shipper
pays.
now,
on
an
unpublished
division
of
a
joint
rate
is
not
a
rate
or
charge
within
the
meaning
of
section
3
(4)
of
the
act.
the
section
3
(4)
insofar
as
it's
applicable
to
this
case,
merely
prohibits
the
carrier
subject
to
part
one
of
the
act,
and
also,
now
by
the
transportation
act
of
1940
of
the
--
the
barge,
the
water
carriers.
it
prohibits
carriers
from
discriminating
in
their
rates,
fares
and
charges.
now,
there's
no
other
word
said
about
divisions
in
--
in
section
3
(4).
and
the
--
and
the
division,
the
commission
has
held
in
--
in
numerous
cases
is
not
a
rate.
and
it
held
it
in
--
in
this
case.
now,
this
court
stated
that
in
the
--
in
st.louis
southwestern
railway
company
versus
united
states
in
245
u.s.,
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandeis,
that
a
division
of
a
joint
rate
is
the
share
which
each
railroad
receives
and
there's
a
result
of
private
contract
between
carriers.
and
the
court
said
that
in
that
case,
that
divisions
are
and
i
quote,
"a
matter
of
bargain
and
maybe
fixed
at
in
an
--
in
an
arbitrary
amount,
and
sometimes
one
carrier
is
allowed
the
full
local
rate
while
the
rate
of
another
is
seriously
reduced,
and
that
the
basis
of
such
divisions
differ
greatly
in
practice."
now,
divisions,
therefore,
between
carriers,
reflect
bargaining
and
--
and
strategic
position
of
carriers
participating
in
joint
rates.
they
reflect
competitive
factors.
now,
the
situation
that
is
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
situation
at
the
port
sulphur,
louisiana
to
which
counsel
has
--
counsel
had
referred.
there,
the
--
the
barge
lines
have
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
the
rail
lines
for
the
delivery
of
sulphur
from
port
sulphur
to
danville
--
to
danville,
illinois.
the
barge
line
factor
for
the
transportation
from
new
orleans
or
port
sulphur
to
east
st.louis
is
$4.20.
the
--
the
rail
carriers,
the
total
through
rate
i
believe
is
$6.66
on
which
the
barge
factor
is
only
$4.20.
and
the
railroads
accept
as
a
division
in
lieu
of
the
$2.95
rate,
$2.26,
a
100
pounds
for
each
share
of
the
transportation.
now,
with
respect
to
that
sulphur,
the
--
the
sulphur
originates
with
the
barge
lines.
it's
brought
in
by
some
private,
little
tramcars
or
something
owned
by
the
producers
and
it
moved
a
few
hundred
yards
or
whatever
the
distance
is,
up
to
the
barges
and
they
load
it
in
to
the
barge.
so,
the
price
of
sulphur
or
rather
the
--
the
sulphur
at
port
sulphur
has
no
prior
rail
haul.
the
railroads
have
their
hands
upon
it.
and
they
get
to
east
st.louis.
now,
the
--
then,
they
are
able.
they're
in
a
strategic
position
in
order
to
get
a
little
--
to
get
a
better
share
of
the
division,
and
there
is
nothing
to
send
us
through,
as
i
understand
it
about
carriers
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
entering
into
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
because
they
have
the
sulphur,
they
originated
the
sulphur
themselves
and
they
have
it
and
they
--
and
of
course,
under
section
15
(6),
if
your
honor
please,
the
--
which
gives
the
commission
now
jurisdiction
over
divisions
of
rates.
it
--
it
--
they
stated
in
that
--
in
that
section,
section
15
(6),
the
standards
by
which
the
commission
must
--
will
be
governed
in
determining
division
of
rates.
and
one
of
those
standards
or
factors
is,
whether
or
not
the
carrier
involved
with
the
division,
would
be
an
originating
carrier
or
whether
he's
an
intermediate
or
a
delivering
carrier.
of
course,
the
other
factor
is
involved.
there's
a
cost
of
service
and
all
of
--
and
--
and
several
other
factors,
but
those
factors
are
even
different
from
the
factors
going
into
the
matter
of
determining
what
is
a
reasonable
rate.
so,
what
i
am
trying
to
point
out
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
the
galveston
--
well,
i
--
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
as
far
to
the
materials
here,
that
would
be
true.
i
don't
know
whether
they
have
rail
lines
that
--
i
believe
from
new
orleans
and
they're
serving
danville
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
but
i
don't
know
whether
they
carry
sulphur
or
not.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
there
is
no
--
there's
no
joint
rates
published,
and
no
movement
over
any
joint
rates
of
sulphur
from
galveston
to
danville,
texas
or
to
any
other
point
in
new
orleans.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
a
railroad
from
the
sulphur
plant
brings
the
sulphur
down
to
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
oh,
the
railroads
--
if
the
court
please,
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
this
texas
mine,
the
texas
mines
from
which
this
sulphur
originates
is
located
down
the
tracks,
i
believe
in
the
southern
pacific.
and
the
southern
pacific
originates
the
traffic
at
the
mines.
the
--
the
sulphur
is
loaded
into
rail
cars
at
the
mines
at
new
gulf
in
these
points
where
it's
produced,
and
there
--
and
there's
a
true
all-rail
movement,
clear
through
to
east
st.louis
where
the
sulphur
danville
is
turned
over
to
the
appellee
railroads
by
merely
switching
the
cars
from
out
of
the
trains
of
the
--
of
the
texas
carriers
and
it
goes
onto
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
they
--
the
through
--
you're
talking
about
the
through
all-rail
movement?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor,
that
--
that's
true.
but
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
of
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
oh,
you're
talking
about
the
danville
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
they
have
--
they
have
the
--
there's
no
connection
except
they
have
the
through
routes
and
joint
rate
arrangements
between
each
other.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
mr.
samuel

howell
east
st.louis
carriers,
you're
right,
your
honor.
they
--
they
do
not
have
any
advantage
there
over
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
they
are
the
delivering
carriers
and
the
--
and
the
texas
carriers
are
the
originating
carriers,
the
texas
carriers
would
be
in
a
better
strategic
position
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
with
reference
to
getting
this
--
i
mean,
in
making
the
rate.
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
in
making
a
rate,
making
a
division.
so,
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor,
that's
our
position.
and
that
the
division
of
a
rate
is
not
a
rate,
and
therefore
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
there's
no
charge
made
to
the
railroad,
i
mean
to
the
shipper
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
in
connection
with
divisions.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
i
say
that
they
would
be
connecting
lines.
although,
they
do
not
connect
physically
like
railroads
running
into
each
other,
but
they
are
--
they
would
be
considered
under
the
terms
of
section
3
(4)
as
connecting
line.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
but,
your
honor,
the
--
a
division
of
a
rate
is
not
a
rate,
and
i'm
going
to
discuss
that
further
and
make
it
clear
if
i
can,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
it
is
not.
the
--
the
$2.95
local
rate
is
a
rate
that
applies
over
the
--
this
appellee
railroad
from
east
st.louis
to
danville
on
all
traffic
that
would
--
would
--
except
that
with
which
it
might
have
--
the
railroads
might
have
through
routes
and
joint
rate
arrangements
and
always
the
joint
rates
are
smaller
than
the
through
combination
rates.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that
is
one
--
another
form
of
this
3
(4)
--
section
3
(4)
violation
that
appellants
set
forth
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
if
your
honor
please,
the
reason
the
commission
did
not
find
that
the
--
find
discrimination
and
it
may
well
have
ordered
a
through
routes
and
joint
rates
if
it
had
found
discrimination
was
because
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
--
to
prove
that
there
was
a
need,
first
in
the
public
interests
for
these
through
routes.
and
secondly,
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
there
was
any
need
for
any
differential
rates,
lower
than
the
all
--
lower
than
the
joint
through
all-rail
rate.
there
was
--
there
was
no
evidence
and
--
and
that's
the
thing
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor.
well,
no
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
no,
the
--
the
answer
to
that
would
be
that
the
all
--
that
the
$2.95
local
rates
of
the
danville,
east
st.
louis-danville
carrier
is
shown
to
be
on
a
depressed
basis.
now,
that
is
shown
in
the
record
that
the
--
at
--
by
--
and
the
commission
points
out,
makes
a
finding
on
it.
that
the
--
that
the
general
basis
for
the
reasonableness
of
some
rates
in
the
southwestern
or
southeastern
texas
area
was
13.5%
of
first
class.
now,
that
--
that
rate
was
found
reasonable
by
a
commission
in
an
appropriate
proceeding,
marion
manufacturing
company
versus
the
akron
railroad.
and
that
the
--
and
that
--
that
rate
which
is
found
reasonable
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
no.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
as
--
as
--
well,
as
any
rate.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
and
onto
--
i'm
coming
to
the
local
rate,
if
the
court
please,
and
it
found
in
this
case
that
if
the
--
if
the
reasonable
--
if
rates
that
are
13.5%
of
first
class
on
sulphur
is
reasonable
in
the
southeastern
texas,
then
the
two
$2.95
rate,
which
is
9.2%
of
first
class
would
show
that
the
$2.95
rate
was
a
depressed
rate,
and
it
makes
comparisons
between
the
--
the
rates
on
comparable
distances
within
the
area
around
the
east
st.
louis
and
danville.
and
it
shows
that
the
rates
from
--
well,
a
comparable
distance
might
be
as
much
as
twice,
i
mean,
be
twice
as
much
as
the
$2.95
rate.
and
in
every
rate
they
used,
they
showed
that
the
--
that
the
rate
for
comparable
distance
was
more
than
the
$2.95.
so,
the
commission
found
that
the
$2.95
rate
was
depressed.
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
commission
should
not
compel
the
railroads
to
further
reduce
a
depressed
rate
in
order
to
give
the
barge
lines
a
--
a
--
an
advantage
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
and
a
bonus.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be
giving
them
a
bonus.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
know
any
offhand?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
don't
know
that
i
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
don't
happen
to
believe
one
way
or
the
other
about
it,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
such
rate
and
i
don't
know
that
i
have
heard
of
any,
i
mean
any
such
situation.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
but
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
the
reason
why
that
the
railroads
make
the
first
rates
and
there
--
and
they
have
the
authority.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor,
that
--
that's
right.
now,
the
--
i'd
like
to
say
this
that
the
commission
found
that
the
barge,
that
the
fully
distributed
cost
of
the
barge
lines
for
transporting
the
sulphur
from
galveston
to
east
st.louis
amounted
to
$4.03
a
ton.
and
that
the
--
the
barge
rate
--
oh,
and
added
to
that
would
be
of
course
the
--
i
think
29
cents
is
shown
in
the
--
the
record,
29
cents
across
to
the
barge
lines
for
transferring
the
sulphur
from
the
rail
--
from
barge
to
rail
which
will
make
a
total
of
$4.23
--
$4.32,
a
fully
distributed
cost
of
the
barge
lines
for
transporting
the
sulphur.
now,
they
charge
a
rate
of
$5.32.
that's
the
barge
factor,
so
that
would
give
the
rail
--
would
give
the
barge
lines
a
total
profit
on
a
ton
of
sulphur
moved
from
galveston
to
the
east
st.
louis
of
$1.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
so
they're
getting
their
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
they
--
they
are
--
of
course,
the
barge
lines
and
from
those
--
from
those
figures
would
be
--
would
indicate
that
the
barge
lines
are
getting
a
very
fair
profit
on
the
movement
of
sulphur.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
your
concern
with
the
economy
of
the
barge
lines,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
your
honor,
they
--
they
can,
on
the
basis
of
the
earnings
as
shown.
i
can
only
speak
from
the
record
to
the
court,
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
if
they
need
to
--
if
they
need
to
get
this
traffic,
if
they
want
to
get
the
traffic,
the
commission
found
that
they
--
that
since
the
rail
rate
was
reasonable
and
since
this
factor
from
east
st.louis
to
danville
was
depressed,
that
if
the
barge
lines
hope
to
get
into
this
traffic,
then
they
should
reduce
their
--
their
barge
factor
from
galveston
to
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
it
did
in
--
in
effect
here.
it
passed
on
the
reason
it
found
that
there
was
a
--
that
the
barge
lines
were
making
a
--
a
gross
profit
after
--
they're
making
a
profit
of
$1
a
ton,
for
every
ton
of
sulphur
they
move
from
galveston
to
east
st.
louis,
and
that
the
rail
--
the
rail
rates
from
--
of
the
railroads
was
depressed,
and
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
the
reason
of
the
rate
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
the
rates
have
been
in
effect,
certainly,
i
believe,
since
world
war
ii,
and
--
but
the
--
but
there's
never
been
any
--
any
shipments
by
water
from
galveston
by
the
appellant
barge
lines.
there
was
a
contract
carrier
barge
lines
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
never
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
they
never
were
in
the
barge
businesses,
if
the
court
please.
and
there
was
a
time
though
back
when
this
record
--
i
mean,
from
galveston
to
east
st.--
from
galveston
to
danville.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
they
never
had
any
traffic
before
and
we
don't
have
any
now.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
oh,
i
don't
know
they
were
carrying
sulphur.
they
may
be
carrying
sulphur
now
from
galveston
to
east
st.louis
and
then
advance
to
danville
over
the
road.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
haven't
heard
of
one
going
out
of
business.
and
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
as
to
the
--
the
time
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
there
--
there
is
no
evidence
as
far
as
--
as
i
know
in
the
record,
your
honor,
on
that
subject.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
never
heard
of
any
and
there
never
will
be
any
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
there
will
never
be
any
as
to
the
--
because
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
because
of
the
character
and
nature
of
the
barge
service.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
but
here,
the
--
of
course,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
but
we
must
keep
this
fact
--
we
keep
this
factor
in
mind,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
--
that
it
would
not
be
fair.
it
would
not
be
in
cognizance
with
the
national
transportation
policy
for
any
regulatory
body,
like
the
commission,
to
permit
the
barge
lines
to
tap
the
resources
of
rail
lines
at
interior
points
to
take
traffic
there
and
to
bring
it
to
the
barge
lines,
draw
it
to
the
barge
lines
to
give
the
barge
lines
a
haul.
only
in
those
instances
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
--
where
it
would
be
--
it
will
not
be
consistent
with
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
oh,
yes,
the
commission
does
that,
they
recognize
that
fact
in
this
case
here
and
points
it
out.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
from
the
decisions
that
i
--
i
think
from
the
decisions
that
i
have
read
and
i
can't
name
one
to
your
honor,
--
to
your
honor
but
i
think
in
the
decisions
of
these
cases
i've
read,
rail
versus
barge
rates
that
the
commission
has
tried
to
balance
the
factors
thereunto
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
the
--
because
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
the
--
the
answer
would
be
that
you'd
have
to
take
into
consideration,
of
course,
the
--
the
cost
--
the
cost
of
moving
by
a
barge
line
and
the
cost
of
moving
by
the
rail
lines.
and
here,
i
think
there
will
be
a
savings
under
the
present
all-rail
rate.
if
you
adopt
the
--
if
the
commission
had
granted
the
proposed
joint
barge
rail
rate
that
these
barge
lines
sought,
there
would
be
a
savings
to
the
--
to
the
shipper
or
to
the
consignee
when
he
uses
barge
lines,
barge-rail
rates
rather
than
the
through
barge
service
of
only
$1.04,
a
gross
ton.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
the
--
the
barge
lines
--
the
barge
lines
rate
would
be
only
$1.04
under
the
all
-rail
rate.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
oh,
they
can
carry
cheaper.
oh,
yes.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well
--
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
well,
the
--
the
--
of
course,
the
commission
would
determine
the
reasonableness
--
have
i
taken
up
30
minutes?
we've
agreed
on
a
division
of
time
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
if
i've
gone
over.
but
the
--
of
course,
the
--
the
railroads
could
not
or
any
carrier,
reduce
its
rates
below
a
reasonable
minimum
rate.
they'd
have
to
keep
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
and
the
commission
would
check
that,
but
it
would
certainly
try
us
to
do
equity
and
justice
between
the
barge
and
the
rail
lines.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
i
believe
--
i'm
not
sure,
but
i
think
it's
depressed
from
$1
--
i'm
not
sure.
i
believe
mr.
daily,
who
will
follow
me,
can
answer
that.
mr.
samuel
r.
howell
thank
you,
your
honor.
