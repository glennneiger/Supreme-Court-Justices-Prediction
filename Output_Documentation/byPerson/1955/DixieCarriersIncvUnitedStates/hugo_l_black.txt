justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
does
it
result
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
these
different
waivers,
fixing
rates
whether
joint
or
proportional
or
what
it
is
but
when
you
get
through
here
what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
ship
by
barge
and
if
they
ship
by
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
finding
of
any
kind
that
it
cost
any
more
to
ship
sulphur
from
east
st.
louis
on
that
road
to
danville
by
bringing
it
up
on
a
barge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
claim
that
it
costs
them
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
that.
what
i
wanted
to
find
out
more
if
there
is
any
claim
of
any
kind
that
this
is
justified
by
reason
of
a
difference
in
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
they
said
that
the
railroad,
that
in
order
to
compete
with
the
barges,
set
their
rates
down
to
nearly
as
low
as
they
were
and
that
now
it
would
be
wrong
to
fix
it
to
where
the
barges
could
get
the
advantage
of
a
cheaper
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
that
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
way
they
could
show
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
way
they
could
show
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
they
icc
let
that
kind
of
evidence
to
be
introduced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
they
--
do
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
not
let
it
come
in?
do
they
further
require
them
to
admit
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
of
the
icc
holdings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
hold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
hold
about
the
evidence?
is
that
--
if
it's
hard
to
answer,
i
don't
want
to
ask
it
but
i
didn't
suppose
it'd
be
hard
for
a
lawyer
for
the
icc
to
tell
us
what
they
hold
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
do
they
hold
that
it
can
be
admitted
in
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
they
hold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
do
you
--
do
you
allege
that
they
should
have
done
that
or
do
you
admit
that
the
rule
of
the
commission
is
they
won't
bring
it
in?
i
--
i
mean
to
--
i'd
like
to
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
a
bonus?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
cite
us
to
a
single
case
that
the
commission
has
ever
decided
where
it
denies
relief
to
a
railroad
that
was
compelled
by
whatever
method
to
pay
more
or
the
--
have
its
goods
transported
on
the
railroad
than
another
one
to
have
its
goods
transported
on
the
railroad
on
precisely
on
the
same
conditions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
heard
of
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
believe
there
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
economy
of
the
barge
lines?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
they
operate
--
can
they
operate
on
this
basis
against
the
railroad
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
a
matter
of
common
sense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
they
could
cut
their
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
--
does
the
commission
have
a
right
to
pass
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
barge
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
could
do
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
these
barge
lines
since
it's
raised
by
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
the
barge
--
what
happened
to
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
haven't
gone
out
of
business
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
of
any
barge
lines
in
the
united
states
since
there
have
been
barge
lines
that
were
able
to
carry
anything
by
charging
a
higher
rate
than
the
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
heard
of
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
dreamed
that
there
could
be
such?
justice
hugo
l.
black
never
will
be
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
so
that
you
know
without
any
evidence,
the
commission
knows
without
any
evidence
that
the
barge
rate
is
higher
than
the
other.
the
barge
rate
can't
carry
any
goods.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
wrong,
are
there
any
barges
that
travel
at
that
rate
that
can
carry
any
goods
that
they
charge
more
than
the
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
of
none.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
congress
appeal
--
did
congress
appeal
that
statement
that
says,
“it's
the
duty
to
operate
this
thing,
this
law
in
a
way
that
will
give
the
barge
lines
inherent
advantages
of
a
cheaper
rate,
a
tad
cheaper?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
you
said
--
you
mean
--
it
said,
it
recognize
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
they
recognize
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
could
you
--
how
could
you
say
they
did
it
here
when
the
rate
is
higher
on
the
barge
than
it
is
on
the
railroad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
say
so,
but
now,
i
just
want
to
know
if
--
if
that
can
be
proven.
i'd
like
to
have
it
established.
i
--
i
wouldn't
have
thought
it
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
could
carry
that
much
cheaper,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
how
much
--
i'm
not
talking
about
how
much
they've
gained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
carry
cheaper
and
can
carry
cheaper
than
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
also
confronted
with
the
lower
or
the
higher
--
being
compelled
to
pay
a
higher
rate
to
the
railroad
rate,
i
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
established
here,
because
i
may
be
wrong,
that
the
same
sulphur
come
from
the
same
place,
precisely
the
same
time
it
gets
to
east
st.louis,
and
your
railroad
takes
it
to
danville,
you
charge
more
for
it
if
it
came
by
railroad
or
if
it
came
by
barge
than
when
it
came
by
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
--
you
collect
that
much
more.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
act
of
congress
didn't
--
didn't
draw
distinctions
that
divisions
and
proportions
or
any
other
labels,
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
there
could
not
be
any
discrimination
so
that
the
railroads
would
be
allowed
to
charge
more
rates
than
barges
and
deprive
barges
of
the
inherent
advantages
which
--
which
they
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
they
didn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
they
didn't
give
--
do
you
think
it
didn't
give
the
commission
power
without
regard
to
name
if
the
barges
were
being
charged
--
if
you
were
charging
more
for
the
transportation
of
stuff
that
came
over
a
barge
as
to
the
stuff
that
came
over
a
railroad
that
congress
is
--
the
icc
is
without
power
to
prevent
the
discrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
could
prevent
this
then,
could
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
your
ground
then,
if
they
didn't
start
the
proper
proceedings
and
they
haven't
proceeded
in
the
right
way,
now,
that
may
be
a
good
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean,
decreased
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
explain
your
viewpoint
of
what
was
said
about
the
contract
carrier
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
your
--
and
the
contract
barges
in
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
to
dispute
that
anywhere
else
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
that
the
result
of
all
--
for
some
--
for
some
reason,
all
the
sulphur
now
goes
over
the
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
folio
34?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
folio
33
is
folio
25.
that's
what
you
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
didn't
--
