mr.
friedman,
you
may
continue
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
can't
blame
them
very
much
for
not
bringing
it
in
here,
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
that
they
didn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
is
--
has
the
rate
been
depressed
between
galveston
and
east
st.
louis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
will
ask
him
then,
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
answering
that
question,
please,
mr.
daily.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
rail
rate
between

and
east
st.
louis
has
been
depressed
on
this
sulphur.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
give
us
the
best
you
can
give
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
$2.50?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
shouldn't
--
why
shouldn't
the
railroad
--
danville
railroads
be
willing
to
--
to
give
the
barge
line
the
same
--
the
same
rate
as
it
gives
the
other
railroad
carriers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
will
you
gain
any
benefit
from
--
from
the
higher
rate
that
you
charge
the
--
the
barge
people
if
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
barge
traffic
and
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
get
all
of
the
sulphur
there
by
rail
at
your
$2.26
rate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
haven't
got
it.
you
won't
have
it
now
when
you
entered
this
ruling
of
the
--
of
the
commission.
there's
nobody
who's
going
to
--
nobody
is
going
to
ship
anything
by
barge,
are
they,
if
it
costs
70
cents
a
ton
more
to
get
it
from
--
from
the
mines
to
danville.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
you'll
--
you
--
you'll
have
to
carry
all
of
it
for
your
$2.26
anyway,
won't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belnap,
you
have
a
few
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
answer
the
--
that
last
question.
did
you
have
a
question?
did
you
finish
the
--
did
you
finish
your
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
well
