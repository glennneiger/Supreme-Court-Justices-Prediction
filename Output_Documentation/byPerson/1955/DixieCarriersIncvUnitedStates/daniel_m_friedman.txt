mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
we
are
a
statutory
appellee
before
this
court
but
where
the
view
that
the
commission
has
erred
in
this
case
in
failing
to
find
that
it
was
required
to
establish
through
route
and
joint
rates.
mr.
belnap
and
ourselves
reach
the
same
result
but
we
tend
to
reach
by
a
somewhat
different
ground.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
are
a
statutory
appellee.
we
have
been
made
by
congress
a
separate
party
in
the
cases
seeking
review
of
the
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
--
no,
mr.
justice
--
justice,
our
interest
in
achieving
what
we
believe
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
will
be
the
correct
construction
of
the
law.
it
was
at
one
time
that
it
was
sold
to
private
parties
approximately
three
years
ago.
the
statutory
provisions
upon
in
which
we
rely
primarily
are
section
309
(d)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
together
with
the
national
transportation
policy.
that
section
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
our
brief.
the
section
in
brief
states
that
the
commission
shall,
whenever
deemed
by
it
to
be
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest,
establish
through
routes
and
joint
rates
between
rail
and
water
carriers.
and
in
the
event
that
the
through
routes
have
been
established
between
a
rail
and
a
water
carrier
to
prescribe
reasonable
differential
between
the
level
of
the
all-rail
rates
and
the
level
of
the
rail
barge
rates.
in
this
situation
here
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
we
think
that
that
is
a
question
which
is
not
reached
initially
until
we
first
show
the
need
for
establishing
the
through
routes
and
the
joint
rates.
in
other
words,
we
have
not
argued
that
point
because
we
think
the
amount
of
the
division
is
properly
to
be
determined
by
the
commission
upon
remand.
the
railroad
before
this
court
not
only
the
railroads
going
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville.
now,
absent
any
joint
rail
rate,
the
situation
as
far
as
the
danville
shipper
receiver
is
concerned
would
be
as
follows.
if
he
would
accept
all-rail
by
saying
the
combination
of
this
rate
and
this
rate
from
galveston
to
east
st.
louis
and
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville,
he
would
pay
$11.66.
however,
if
the
sulphur
was
shipped
from
the
mines
to
galveston
at
a
total
cost
of
$1.50
and
then
by
barge
along
the
inland
waterway
and
to
east
st.
louis
and
then
again
by
rail
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville,
he
would
pay
not
$11.66
but
$9.77,
approximately
$2
less.
so
that
absent
a
joint
all-rail
rate,
demand
to
wish
--
to
take
advantage
of
the
slower
barge
service
would
have
it
reflected
in
a
lower
cost
for
them.
the
railroads,
however,
have
established
a
joint
all-rail
rate
of
$9.18,
approximately
60
cents
below
the
rail-barge
combination
rate
and
they
have
refused
to
establish
a
comparable
relationship
between
the
rail
and
barge
transportation.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
mechling
case,
the
inherent
advantage
of
barge
transportation
is
its
cheapness,
its
inferior
service.
there's
no
question
about
that.
it's
slower
but
it's
cheaper.
sulphur
is
a
commodity
which
has
particularly
well
adapted
the
transportation
by
barge.
it's
generally
stockpiled.
there's
no
great
rush
on
it.
it
doesn't
matter
if
it
gets
there
a
week
sooner
or
a
week
later.
it's
relatively
easy
to
handle.
there's
little
damage
in
transit.
so
that
a
shipper
would
ordinarily
be
in
a
position
that
if
it
was
substantially
cheaper
to
handle
a
ship
by
barge
and
to
ship
by
rail,
he
might
find
it
advantageous
to
do
so.
and
in
fact,
the
situation
in
this
country
is
that
there
are
many,
many
joint
rail-barge
rates
and
sulphur
is
one
of
the
major
commodities
which
moves
by
barge.
however
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
not
shown
by
the
record
but
it's
been
enforced
for
a
number
of
years.
approximately,
i
would
say
from
before
the
war.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
record
does
indicate,
mr.
justice,
that
the
low
level
of
rates,
not
necessarily
this
particular
joint
rate
but
the
low
level
of
rates
in
this
area,
the
all
--
the
rail
rate
was
specifically
directed
against
barge
transportation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sulphur,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
commission
in
fact
found
that
the
rate
from
here
to
here,
the
all-rail
rate
is
a
depressed
rate
specifically
designed
to
meet
barge
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
difference
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
the
present
time,
if
you
ship
by
barge,
even
though
the
barge
service
is
slower,
you
pay
60
cents
more
at
the
present
rate
structure.
absent
the
joint
all-rail
rate,
you
will
pay
$2
less
for
the
cheaper,
slower
barge
service.
that's
the
practical
effect
of
this
situation
because
the
total
of
the
rail
and
barge
rate
is
$9.77
as
against
a
total
of
$9.18
for
the
all-rail
joint
rate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
the
barges,
a
part
of
their
$5.32
local
rate
absorb
all
the
cost
of
transferring
the
sulphur
from
the
barge
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
the
commission
found
it
was
justified
for
two
reasons.
they
said
first,
the
all-rail
rate
is
a
depressed
rate
and
therefore
they
said
critical
ready
depressed,
it
isn't
fair
that
the
railroad
could
take
a
still
smaller
amount.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
theory
of
--
of
the
commission
apparently
is
that
since
the
railroads
have
found
it
necessary
to
cut
their
rates
to
compete
with
the
barges,
the
barges
would
therefore
be
frozen
out
of
its
pocket.
and
that
of
course
is
the
practical
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
but
he
gets
a
money
handicap
under
the
present
rate
structure.
he
pays
60
cents
more
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
for
the
shipping
on
the
slower
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
i
--
the
higher
cost,
however,
is
down
a
half
price
is
primarily
the
result
of
the
increased
transportation
cost.
it
costs
$1.10
for
the
rail
service
from
the
mines
to
galveston.
so,
in
a
realistic
sense,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
this
is
a
higher
cost
of
sulphur.
this
is
a
higher
transportation
cost
of
sulphur.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice
but
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
despite
that
extra
$1.50,
the
barge
route
ordinarily
would
still
be
cheaper
because
despite
this
$1.50
extra,
the
total
cost
is
still
$9.77,
the
present
charge
as
against
$11
for
the
total
of
the
all-rail
rates.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
$8.27
plus
$1.50
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
or
$9.77.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
joint
all-rail
rate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
when
the
court
arose
i
was
just
coming
to
a
brief
discussion
of
the
statutory
provision
in
section
307
(d),
which
directs
the
commission
whenever
deemed
by
it
to
be
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest
to
establish
through
route
and
joint
rates.
this
provision
which
was
passed
in
1940
marked
the
culmination
of
a
long
struggle
almost
by
congress
to
obtain
adequate
joint
rail-barge
relationships.
the
federal
barge
service
began
shortly
after
world
war
i,
and
then
a
series
of
statutes
which
we
have
traced
in
our
brief,
congress
again
and
again
emphasized
the
importance
of
prescribing
fair,
through
joint-barge
routes
and
rates.
as
a
realistic
matter,
it's
only
in
a
small
percentage
of
the
cases
that
barge
transportation
is
meaningful
just
by
itself.
most
shippers
and
most
receivers
are
not
both
located
on
a
waterway
and
the
result
is
that
the
barge
transportation
to
be
effective,
it
is
necessary
that
there'll
be
a
connection,
either
at
the
beginning
or
the
end
of
the
water
journey
or
in
fact,
at
both.
the
inherent
advantage
of
barge
transportation
as
this
court
recognized
in
mechling
is
its
cheapness.
now,
if
you
have
--
again,
reverting
to
the
fact
of
this
case,
if
you
have
a
cheaper
route
in
here,
this
course
here
is
$5.32
for
the
barge
plus
a
$1.5
to
bring
it
to
the
--
from
the
mine
to
galveston
was
$6.82
as
against
a
local
railway
from
the
mine
to
here
of
possibly
$8.73.
the
saving
of
a
$1.91,
if
you're
just
going
from
here
to
here,
but
if
that
is
not
passed
on
through
a
connecting
rail
carrier,
the
result
is
that
the
person
who
wants
to
get
this
sulphur
here
does
not
get
the
benefit.
now,
when
congress
passed
the
statute
in
1940,
one
of
the
things
that
it
was
concerned
with
and
deeply
concerned
was
the
fare
expressed
by
the
proponents
of
water
transportation.
that
congress
--
that
the
commission
might
administer
this
act
so
as
to
favor
the
rail
carriers
over
the
water
carriers,
and
it
inserted
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
mechling
a
number
of
provisions
designed
to
do
that.
the
mechling
case
was
concerned
with
an
attempt
by
the
railroads
to
favor
railroads
over
barge
transportation
through
the
device
of
raising
the
rates
on
the
traffic
which
had
been
moved
in
by
barge.
in
the
mechling
case,
this
court
struck
down
a
commission
order
which
had
approved
a
rate
under
which
the
railroads
attempted
to
charge
more
for
grain
moving
from
chicago
to
the
east.
if
it
arrived
in
chicago
by
barge,
then
it
arrives
in
rail.
and
in
condemning
that
rate
structure,
this
court
repeatedly
pointed
out
that
congress
permitted
the
commission
no
way
in
which
it
could
approve
any
rate
system
which
failed
to
pass
on
to
people
who
ship
by
barge
the
inherent
advantage
of
barge
transportation,
namely,
its
lower
cost
and
it
relied
primarily
on
the
statement
in
the
national
transportation
policy
that
the
commission
in
administering
the
act
was
to
make
sure
that
it
would
recognize
and
preserve
the
inherent
advantages
of
each
form
of
transportation.
now,
congress,
when
it
passed
the
1940
act,
also
recognized
there
was
another
way
in
which
the
inherent
advantage
of
barge
transportation
could
be
denied
to
shippers.
instead
of
the
railroads
increasing
the
rail-barge
rate,
and
therefore,
wiping
out
the
lower
cost
of
barge
transportation,
the
railroads
could
reduce
their
own
rates
to
the
level
of
the
barge
rates
and
that
would
have
the
same
effect
and
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
colloquy
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
which
that
very
question
was
raised.
it
was
pointed
out,
“yes,
that
is
prohibited
by
the
act.”
now,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
effective
utilization
of
barge
transportation
requires
that
there'll
be
fair
arrangements
between
the
barges
and
the
rail
carriers
to
pass
on
to
the
shippers
the
inherent
advantage
of
the
barge
transportation.
the
failure
of
the
railroads
to
establish
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
a
connecting
barge
line,
while
at
the
same
time,
maintaining
such
a
relationship
with
a
connecting
rail
rate
in
a
very
serious
sense
denies
to
those
who
would
ship
by
barge
the
inherent
advantages
of
the
barge
transportation.
in
the
mechling
case,
i'd
like
to
quote
briefly,
“the
court
pointed
out
at
page
579
that
it
was
not
within
the
province
of
the
commission
to
adjust
rates,
elimination,
to
protect
the
traffic
of
railroads
from
barge
competition.”
we
think
realistically
in
this
case
that
is
what
has
happened.
the
only
carrier
that
was
before
this
court
and
the
only
defendant
railroad
before
the
commission
were
these
railroads
here,
not
any
of
these
railroads
going
from
east
st.louis
to
the
mine.
these
railroads
up
here,
the
ones
who
were
receiving
the
barge
track
have
refused
to
establish
the
joint
rates
for
the
rail
carriers
on
the
ostensible
ground
that
if
they
don't
want
to
get
less
than
$2.95
from
a
barge
traffic
moving
along
here.
well,
the
first
and
obvious
answer
to
that
is
they're
not
getting
anything
on
the
barge
traffic
now
because
no
barge
traffic
is
moving.
the
commission
found
that
since
1950,
all
of
the
traffic
from
the
galveston
mines
to
danville
has
moved
by
rail,
and
of
course,
that
isn't
at
all
surprising
because
i
seriously
doubt
that
any
sane
businessmen
would
want
to
pay
60
cents
more
for
inferior
transportation.
the
commission
now
suggests
in
its
brief
that
there
was
another
ground
upon
which
this
description
of
through
joint
rates
is
not
required.
it
says
at
page
50,
“the
commission
was
not
required
to
support
the
railroad
to
give
up
their
long
haul
of
a
thousand
mile
and
merely
taking
an
exchange
this
short
186-mile
for
--
from
east
st.louis
to
danville.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
commission
says
that
in
its
brief
now.
and
our
answer
to
that
is,
that
the
only
question
here
is
whether
this
railroad,
the
railroads
from
east
st.louis
to
danville
are
required
to
treat
the
barges
at
least
the
same
way
as
they
treat
the
connecting
railroad.
and
the
fact
that
they
apparently
wish
to
protect
these
railroads
from
barge
competition
is
not
a
proper
ventures
upon
which
the
commission
refuses
to
prescribe
the
through
joint
rates.
the
commission
also
suggests
in
its
brief
that
the
barge
route
is
circuitous,
much
longer
than
the
railroad.
therefore,
they
say
now,
“it
was
not
required
--
that
the
commission
is
not
required
to
find
a
description
of
rail
barge
rates
within
the
through
rates
within
the
public
interest.
the
short
answer
to
that
we
think
is
two-fold.
first,
the
commission
did
not
rely
on
that,
they
didn't.
the
second
and
more
important,
the
lower
barge
cost,
the
total
of
$9.77
as
against
the
old
rail
combination
rate
of
$11.66
was
achieved
despite
the
fact
that
the
barge
traffic
is
more
--
a
more
cumbersome
route.
and
of
course,
one
of
the
things
about
the
barge
is
it's
slower.
the
barges
themselves
move
slower
and
the
river
twists
and
turns,
it
doesn't
go
straight
the
way
a
railroad
track
does.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
barges
are
able
to
operate
this
route
at
$5.32.
they
should
be
permitted
to
pass
on
to
shippers
the
same
benefits
that
the
connecting
rail
--
the
railroad
got
here
give
to
their
connecting
rail
carriers.
we
thus
think
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
where
you
have
a
situation
that
absent
joint
all-rail
rates,
the
rail
barge
cost
to
the
shipper
would
be
substantially
cheaper
than
the
all-rail
rate
and
whereas
the
result
of
a
joint
all-rail
rate,
the
barge
service
which
is
inherently
cheaper
now
costs
60
cents
more
than
the
past
rail
service
that
the
commission
was
inquired
upon
that
it
was
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest
in
order
to
preserve
the
inherent
advantages
of
the
barge
transportation
to
establish
through
barge
routes
and
joints
rates.
we
also
think
that
the
same
result
follows
under
section
3
(4),
which
prohibits
a
discrimination
by
carriers
between
connecting
lines
including
water
carriers.
and
we
think
that
there's

not
necessarily,
mr.
justice,
but
i
can
see
of
no
reason
why
they
would
otherwise
establish
a
joint
rate.
and
i
think
traditionally
in
the
railroad
field,
joint
rates
are
created
to
have
--
mr.

the
--
section
3
(4)
is
basically
designed,
we
think,
to
prohibit
a
carrier
from
favoring
one
of
two
connecting
carriers.
now,
the
commission
repeatedly
has
held
that
if
a
rail
carrier
has
two
connecting
water
carriers,
it's
a
discrimination
prohibited
by
3
(4)
for
it
to
establish
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
one
of
the
water
carriers
and
not
with
one
of
the
others.
similarly,
it
is
held
that
where
there
are
two
connecting
rail
carriers,
it's
discriminatory
to
establish
through
routes
and
joint
rates
with
one
and
not
to
establish
it
with
the
other.
we
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
here
that
one
of
the
connecting
carriers
involved
is
a
water
carrier
and
the
other
one
is
a
rail
carrier.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
connecting
carriers,
it
doesn't
say
discriminate
between
connecting
carriers
of
the
same
type
or
prohibit
discrimination
between
all
connecting
carriers,
and
we
think
that
whether
there
are
two
connecting
carriers,
which
are
competing
with
each
other
for
the
business
of
the
shipper,
the
railroad
is
required
to
treat
them
alike.
of
course,
that's
all
that
the
barges
are
seeking
here.
all
they're
seeking
is
an
opportunity
to
compete
with
the
rails
for
the
shippers'
business
on
the
same
term.
they
proposed,
if
they
will
give
these
railroads
joining
east
st.louis
to
danville
the
same
amount
as
they
receive
from
the
rail
carriers.
it
is
supposed
that
it
is
probably
$2.26
because
that
is
what
they
receive
from
port
sulphur
and
we
think
it's
quite
significant
that
when
there
are
two
sources
of
sulphur,
the
rail
carriers
are
willing
to
make
an
arrangement
with
this
group
and
unwilling
to
make
an
arrangement
with
this
group.
now,
the
way
we
reach
the
conclusion
under
307
(d)
that
the
commission
was
required
to
establish
these
rates
in
order
to
cure
the
discrimination
under
section
3
(4)
is
that
since
it
was
a
discrimination
under
3
(4)
and
is
illegal
under
3
(4),
it
is
plainly
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest
for
the
commission
to
prescribe
through
routes
and
joint
rates
to
cure
that
discrimination.
thank
you.
