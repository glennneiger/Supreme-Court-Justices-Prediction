mr.
john
a.
daily
as
to
how
much
the
rail
rate
has
been
depressed?
mr.
john
a.
daily
well,
the
only
--
i
cannot
give
you
the
starting
point
of
the
--
that
would
be
of
course
the
first
all-rail
rate
that
was
ever
established
between
those
two
points.
you
can
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
well,
you
can
see
from
the
--
from
the
chart
which
mr.
belnap
handed
to
you
at
the
start
of
the
argument
that
the
all-rail
rate
is
$2.50
less
than
the
combination.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
right.
that
may
have
occurred
across
the
period
of
years.
that
rate
of
$9.18,
joint
all-rail,
i
should
like
to
dispel
any
notion
that
that
was
simply
put
in
to
attract
the
danville
trip.
that
is
a
rate
which
represents
41
cents
per
100
pounds,
which
has
been
in
effect
for
many
years
and
which
extends,
not
only
to
danville,
but
to
many,
many
parts
on
the
great
lakes.
we've
had
several
cases
before
the
commission
on
the
41-cent
basis
and
they
have
just
recently,
within
the
last
six
months,
finally
approved
that
rate.
mr.
john
a.
daily
yes,
i
think
it
would
be
approximately
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
yes,
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
it
is
in
the
record,
however.
mr.
john
a.
daily
yes.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that
would
be
your
normal
basis
for
moving
sulphur
in
the
area
which
the
commission
ordinarily
uses
as
a
test.
mr.
john
a.
daily
sir,
it
would
take
a
--
a
rate
man
to
tell
you
that
with
a
tariff
at
his
side.
i
could
not
immediately
tell
you
what
30%
of
first
class
would
be,
but
it
--
it
would
be
somewhat
higher.
mr.
john
a.
daily
yes,
sir.
that
brings
me
to
a
point.
mr.
belnap
was
very
careful
to
point
out
to
you
that
danville
is
an
inland
point
that
there
is
no
water
competition
there,
and
therefore,
that
rate
of
$2.95
could
not
be
depressed.
but
the
$2.95
applies
to
joliet,
which
is
approximately
up
here
on
the
illinois
waterway,
and
that
is
a
competitive
point.
and
on
the
lines
of
these
railroads
operating
between
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
right,
because
danville
would
be
intermediate.
mr.
john
a.
daily
yes.
mr.
john
a.
daily
no.
danville
would
simply
take
the
same
rate
because
it's
intermediate
on
the
lines
of
these
carriers
operating
between
the
st.louis
and
joliet.
now,
while
mister
--
may
i
continue,
mr.
justice?
while
mr.
howell
has
discussed
the
overall
aspects
of
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
commission,
i
should
like
to
make
my
argument
a
bit
more
personal
on
behalf
of
the
railroads.
in
december
of
1949,
these
barge
lines
approached
the
railroads
with
one
proposal,
a
through
route,
a
joint
rate
of
$7.67,
a
division
to
them
of
$5.41,
and
the
balance
of
$2.26
to
us.
now,
please
note
that
their
local
rate
at
that
time
was
$5.32,
so
their
great
contribution
to
this
competitive
effort
is
to
take
9
cents
more
as
their
requested
division
of
the
joint
rate.
so
that
any
advantage,
which
is
going
to
accrue
to
a
shipper
or
consignee
is
going
to
accrue
from
the
railroads,
not
from
any
action
of
the
barge
lines.
we
turned
that
proposal
down.
it
was
not
recommended.
and
we
would
not
recommend
their
proposal
from
any
barge
line
or
any
railroad
on
that
basis,
because,
as
i
think
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out,
joint
rates
are
ordinary
less
than
the
combination
of
locals.
so,
it
means
that
your
division
would
ordinarily
be
less
all
things
considered
equal.
but
what
the
appellants
expect
you
to
do
here
is
to
write
divisions
into
section
3
(4).
they
wish
to
make
a
comparison
between
a
division,
which
is
dealt
elsewhere
within
the
act
and
a
rate
or
a
charge
which
the
congress
deals
with
under
section
3
(4).
they
admit
that
those
two
things
are
not
comparable
when
a
shipper
comes
before
the
commission
or
before
the
court,
but
they
overlooked
the
point
that
the
reason
they're
not
comparable
is
because
they
are
unlike
things
in
their
very
establishment
under
the
law
that
congress
has
dealt
differently
with
both
of
them
in
the
act.
they
are
inherently
different,
and
thus,
it
is
the
comparison
itself
which
is
invalid.
and
if
the
comparison
is
invalid,
it
is
not
--
it
does
not
depend
on
who
makes
it.
a
division
is
specifically
dealt
with
in
section
15
(6).
at
other
points
throughout
the
act,
the
congress
has
taken
care
to
--
to
say
divisions
when
they
mean
divisions.
and
you
will
find
differences
reflected
throughout
the
act
such
as
in
section
1
(4)
where
the
railroads
are
required
to
maintain
just
and
reasonable
rates,
but
just
reasonable,
and
equitable
divisions.
and
nowhere
in
the
act
will
you
find
the
term
“equitable”
used
in
connection
with
the
rate,
a
fare,
or
a
charge.
mr.
john
a.
daily
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
perfectly
right.
and
it
demonstrates,
i
think,
what
i
said
in
the
beginning,
what
they
asked
for
when
they
started
out
a
division
for
themselves
of
$5.41,
9
cents
more
than
the
local.
and
they
have
to
have
that
entire
package,
not
just
any
part
of
it.
they
have
to
have
it
all
and
they're
asking
this
court
to
give
it
to
them
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
john
a.
daily
no.
what
i
say
is
that
they
must
have
that
division
they
require
because
otherwise,
they've
reduced
their
revenue.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
the
only
view
i
see
of
theirs
here,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
a.
daily
i
think
that
i
can
demonstrate
this.
at
the
time
of
this
proposal,
as
were
shown
by
a
movement
study
in
the
past
six
months
of
1950,
the
last
six
months
of
the
1950,
the
record
shows
that
the
contract
carrier,
barge,
was
moving
this
traffic
at
a
rate
of
$4.65
per
gross
ton,
67
cents
a
ton
under
the
local
rate
maintained
by
these
plaintiffs.
it
was
not
moving
all-rail.
they
could
not
conceivably,
honestly,
and
justly
blame
the
all-rail
railroad
rate
for
their
failure
to
share
in
the
tonnage,
because
the
barge
carrier
contract
rate
of
$4.65
obviously
provided
a
much
more
economic
method
of
transportation
to
the
shipper.
now,
when
they
see
that
that
barge,
that
contract
carrier
barge
is
moving
this
at
$4.65,
they
have
two
choices.
the
first
is
obvious,
reduce
our
rate
and
make
ourselves
competitive
on
the
barge
leg
of
the
haul.
the
second
is
a
little
more
obscure
and
it
takes
a
little
ingenuity.
if
we
can
sell
the
railroads,
the
idea
of
a
joint
rate,
through
route,
and
get
at
least
as
much
as
we
now
get
for
our
local
rate,
then
we
can
get
the
sulphur
to
the
danville
consignee
at
the
same
amount
with
very
little
difference,
if
any,
as
that
danville
consignee
can
now
get
it
by
contract
carrier
barge.
and
so,
they
come
to
the
commission
in
the
guise
of
public
interest
and
necessity,
seeking
through
routes
and
joint
rates,
if
you
please,
contending
that
the
railroads
are
keeping
them
out
of
this
traffic,
and
all
they're
going
to
do
is
get
the
sulphur
to
the
danville
consignee
at
the
same
cost.
the
only
difference
is
that
if
they
can
get
that
joint
rate
in
the
public
interest,
that
joint
rate
will
be
available
only
to
them.
and
the
contract
carrier
with
whom
we
do
not
and
are
not
required
to
join
the
joint
rates,
will
still
have
the
application
of
the
$2.95
local
rate,
plus
his
$4.65.
so,
they
get
themselves
into
the
position
where
they
can
compete,
but
at
the
same
time
for
that
barge
leg
of
the
haul,
these
very
generous
people
who
tell
you
they
only
want
equality
of
treatment,
are
not
going
to
give
any
of
that
decreased
cost
to
the
shipper
or
to
the
consignee.
they're
giving
him
nothing
he
doesn't
have
at
the
time,
and
that's
why
no
shipper
or
consignee
appear
if
they
were
giving
them
some
advantage.
in
my
very
brief
experience
with
the
railroads
and
before
the
commission,
i
have
never
noticed
the
reluctance
on
the
part
of
any
shipper
to
appear
and
tell
the
railroads
he
wanted
something,
but
he
wasn't
getting
any
advantage
here.
and
then,
i
think
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
now,
at
the
time,
if
i
may
answer
it
this
way.
at
that
time,
it's
moving
by
contract
carrier
barge,
and
our
revenue
on
the
traffic,
which
is
moving
barge
rail
is
$2.95.
that's
where
the
preponderance
of
the
sulphur
is
moving.
now,
they
come
along
with
their
proposal.
they
want
us
to
reduce
that
revenue
and
they
suggest
$2.26.
so,
we
will
take
the
--
we
will
take
the
difference
of
69
cents
per
gross
ton,
we
lose
that.
the
shipper
gains
nothing
he
doesn't
already
have.
and
the
only
beneficiary
of
the
whole
deal
is
the
plaintiff
barge
lines,
who
come
to
us,
if
you
please,
and
want
more
than
their
local
rate
as
their
division
of
a
joint
rate.
mr.
john
a.
daily
mr.
justice,
that
simply
wasn't
the
fact.
the
fact
is
we
did
have
the
revenue.
we
did
have
the
revenue
at
that
time,
$2.95
a
gross
ton.
mr.
john
a.
daily
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
daily
no,
sir.
that's
what
i
tried
to
point
out
at
the
beginning
that
a
barge
contract
carrier
will
carry
that
sulphur
at
$4.65
a
gross
ton
and
that
apparently
gave
the
shipper
or
consignee
enough
economy
that
that's
the
way
he
wanted
it
to
move.
mr.
john
a.
daily
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
daily
from
galveston.
it
moved
by
galveston
by
a
contract
carrier
who
could
and
did
charge
67
cents
a
gross
ton,
less
than
these
people
who
were
willing
to
share
in
the
business
for
it.
and
they're
not
willing
to
go
down
to
that
level
to
share
in
this
business.
mr.
john
a.
daily
are
you
speaking
about
today?
mr.
john
a.
daily
sir
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
i
suspect
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
--
perhaps
these
inquiries
come
as
a
result
of
the
statement
in
the
government's
brief
that
there
has
been
no
revenue
of
$2.95
since
1950,
and
thus,
today,
as
i
think
they
said,
we
are
not
now
getting
that
revenue.
of
course,
all
they're
saying
there
is
that
they
don't
have
any
movement.
apparently,
the
united
states
was
told
that
by
the
appellant,
he
couldn't
get
it
out
of
the
record.
mr.
john
a.
daily
oh,
yes,
sir,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
a.
daily
the
contract
carriers
are
the
bane
of
their
existence,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
a.
daily
surely.
mr.
john
a.
daily
well,
it
--
it
can't.
obviously,
the
hearing
was
march
14th,
1951
and
that's
when
the
hearing
has
closed
and
the
record
has
closed.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
positively
right,
positively
right,
and
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
off
to
mississippi?
mr.
john
a.
daily
oh,
do
you
mean
just
to
danville
or?
mr.
john
a.
daily
well,
i
think
it
weigh
about
20,000
tons
a
year.
mr.
john
a.
daily
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
john
a.
daily
the
statement
was
that
the
preponderance
of
the
movement
moved
barge
rail.
we
made
a
movement
study
for
the
last
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
they
don't
have
any
traffic
at
all.
mr.
john
a.
daily
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
right.
mr.
john
a.
daily
no,
they
want
a
through
route
rate
and
a
division.
because
if
they
don't
get
that
division,
mr.
justice,
if
the
commission,
assuming
they
had
taken
everything
the
barge
lines
here
said
and
agreed
with
it
and
established
through
routes
and
joint
rates,
these
barge
lines
would
still
have
to
face
the
problem
of
what
their
proper
division
is
under
the
act.and
so
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
and
so.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
the
point
i
made,
sir,
that
they
never
raised
this
business
of
a
division
versus
a
rate
barge
charge,
not
until
after
the
hearing.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
daily
that's
right.
mr.
john
a.
daily
i
think
that's
their
point,
yes,
sir.
yes,
that's
the
point
that
i
think
is
properly
before
the
court.
and
if
i
can
leave
the
subject
of
a
division
--
oh,
before
i
leave
that
subject,
i
would
simply
like
to
point
out
one
factor.
mr.
belnap
left
you
with
the
idea,
or
at
least,
he
left
me
with
the
idea
that
he
was
leaving
you
with
the
idea
that
a
through
route
and
a
joint
rate
is
their
only
answer
to
this
question
of
divisions.
that
--
that
the
commission
cannot
deal
with
these
divisions
and
so
forth
and
that
they
are
left
without
relief
in
the
absence
of
through
routes
and
joint
rates.
nothing
could
be
more
further
from
the
fact.
at
the
time
of
the
oral
argument,
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
was
asked,
“suppose
that
we,”
meaning,
the
commission,
“were
to
establish
proportional
rates
between
east
st.louis
and
danville,
the
same
as
the
amount
of
the
rail
division,
would
that
solve
your
difficulty?”
now,
that's
they're
complaint
here.
that's
the
particular
point
of
the
appellants.
and
the
answer
was,
“yes,
sir,
that's
one
way
of
taking
care
of
the
discrimination,
but
that
isn't
the
one
we
want.”
and
that's
in
the
record
at
pages
146
and
147.
they're
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
a
through
route
and
joint
rate,
and
they
didn't
give
the
commission
a
scintilla
of
evidence
of
the
public
interest
and
necessity
that
is
required
under
section
15
(3)
and
307
(d),
and
the
same
statement
holds
true
for
what
is
or
is
not
a
reasonable
differential
under
section
307
(d).
if
the
--
why
didn't
they
want
that?
now,
let's
assume
that
that
had
been
ordered.
and
now,
we
charge
the
same
for
both
types
of
transportation.
now,
how
can
they
complain
against
us?
they
can't.
but
how
does
that
fit
their
situation?
now,
that
rate
that
the
commission
has
established
means
we've
got
to
charge
the
same
for
everybody,
regardless
of
a
division
or
anything
else.
the
trouble
is
that
rate
would
then
be
available
on
any
sulphur
which
came
in
the
east
st.louis
by
a
railroad
with
whom
we
do
not
joined
in
a
joint
rate,
on
any
sulphur
which
came
into
st.louis
by
truck,
on
any
sulphur
which
came
in
by
the
plaintiff
barge
lines,
and
on
any
sulphur
which
came
in
by
the
contract
carrier
barge
line.
so,
when
they
got
all
through
and
we
were
purged
of
our
so-called
discrimination,
they
would
turn
around
to
be
confronted
with
the
same
competition
they
were
confronted
with
before,
a
lower
contract
rate
on
the
river.
mr.
john
a.
daily
sir,
that
--
that
brings
me
to
the
point
of
divisions
versus
rates,
fares,
and
charges.
that
congress
deals
with
those
specifically.
you
cannot
compare
those
simply
saying
that
this
amount
is
a
division
and
this
amount
is
a
local
rate,
and
the
two
are
different
and
therefore,
some
discrimination
must
exist,
because
different
factors
go
into
account
in
divisions.
divisions
do
not
depend
on
the
cost
of
service
alone.
section
15
(6)
sets
out
the
various
items
which
the
court
--
which
the
commission
has
been
directed
by
the
congress
to
specifically
consider,
and
that's
why,
and
the
appellants
admit
that
divisions
may
and
do
vary
between
the
same
carriers
for
the
same
service
on
the
same
commodity
between
the
same
points.
and
the
fact
that
the
divisions
do
so
differ
from
each
other
establishes
nothing.
mr.
john
a.
daily
and
obviously
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
i
--
i
don't
like
the
term
“charge”,
mr.
justice,
because
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
all
right,
but
that's
our
portion.
when
--
well,
let
--
let's
say
when
we
collect
less,
what
we
collect
is
our
portion
of
a
joint
rate
and
that
does
not
depend
on
the
service
we
render.
mr.
john
a.
daily
well,
sir,
they
did.
mr.
john
a.
daily
i
have
simply
pointed
out
to
you,
sir
that
the
congress
did
distinguish
between
a
division
and
a
rate.
and
they
--
they
expect
reasonable
through
routes
and
the
congress
gives
the
commission
power
to
establish
through
routes
when
they're
reasonable,
when
they're
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
--
and
that's
the
same
for
railroads
or
barge
lines.
mr.
john
a.
daily
sir,
i
just
pointed
out
that
the
icc
does
have
the
power
under
section
611
(b)
to
establish
proportional
rates
of
whatever
amount
they
desire
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
--
on
x
water
trip.
mr.
john
a.
daily
why
certainly,
they
could
prevent
it
if
they
had
raised
the
issue
properly
which
they
did
not.
now
--
mr.
john
a.
daily
what
their
case
might
be
under
six
--
section
611
(b),
i
don't
know.
but
counsel
was
offered
that
from
the
commission.
i
don't
say
offered
it,
they
simply
suggested
it
to
him
and
he
said
no.
that
would
cure
the
discrimination.
they
admit
that,
but
that
isn't
what
they
want.
mr.
john
a.
daily
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
daily
no
change
in
ours.
mr.
john
a.
daily
they
would
simply
decrease
it
as
it
applies
to
these
people.
that's
right.one
more
thing,
there
has
been
some
testimony
of
pro
and
con
about
the
absence
or
a
non-absence
of
a
showing
of
what
service
changes
are
here
or
differences.
there
is
no
showing
at
all
in
this
record,
whether
the
services
are
the
same
or
different,
but
let
me
point
out
just
one
thing
to
you
as
a
matter
of
common
sense.
when
we
receive
all-rail
traffic
from
our
southwestern
connections
at
east
st.louis,
that
sulphur
is
in
cars,
which
is
supplied
by
the
southwestern
lines.
in
maintaining
our
local
rate
between
east
st.louis
and
danville,
it
is
we
who
must
round
up
and
supply
all
these
empty
cars.
in
other
words,
on
through
all-rail
traffic,
our
only
duty
would
be
to
put
a
locomotive
on
the
end
of
their
train
and
take
it
away.
but
here,
just
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
we
have
to
supply
the
cars
from
the
traffic.
we
have
to
round
up
these
empties,
put
them
down
at
the
dock,
how
many
of
them
we
don't
know
because
this
comes
up
in
1,000-ton
lots,
but
that's
a
considerable
number
of
empties
to
supply.
so,
there
is
at
least
that
difference
in
the
service.
