you
mean
the
purchase
price
and
the
sulphur?
justice
stanley
reed
what
the
buyer
has
to
pay?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that's
sent
down
to
galveston
by
the
producer?
justice
stanley
reed
and
there's
no
--
no
way
to
--
to
come
through
galveston
and
on
up
to
danville
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
no.
what
i
meant
no
combined
--
water
and
the
rate?
justice
stanley
reed
no
storage
in
transit?
justice
stanley
reed
that
we're
not
involved
at
all
then
with
that
cost
from
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
when
you
made
your
effort
to
get,
what
you
call,
the
combination
rate
with
water
and
rail?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
when
--
when
you
went
to
--
to
object
to
that,
i
noticed
on
your
roman
ii
that
there's
question
mark
after
the
2.95
which
i
understand
to
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter.
now,
why
--
why
couldn't
you
find
out
what
that
was
when
you
were
there?
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
that.
justice
stanley
reed
did
you
have
a
hearing?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
couldn't
you
--
can
tell
them
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
even
when
you
have
an
application
for
a
different
rate?
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
i
have
a
difficulty.
who
absorbed
the
$1.01?
justice
stanley
reed
the
producer?
justice
stanley
reed
i
see.
justice
stanley
reed
is
that
--
is
that
difference
admitted
--
i
--
i
thought
you
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
was
there
authorized
--
perhaps
the
division
of
rates
too
in
that
section?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that's
because
of
the
higher
cost
that
he
has
to
pay
for
his
sulphur.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
as
i
understand
it
the
--
the
seller
takes
it
at
the
mine
or
at
the
quarry
or
whatever
one
calls
it
and
it
costs
$1.50
to
--
to
put
it
in
condition
to
load
onto
the
barge.
the
barge
has
none
of
that
expense.
the
producer
has
that
and
therefore
he
can't
--
the
producer
cannot
or
will
not
sell
his
sulphur
at
the
same
price
at
galveston
that
he
will
sell
it
at
the
mines.
justice
stanley
reed
and
you
--
you
--
you
get
--
when
you
--
when
you
add
in
your
--
your
cost,
you're
adding
in
that
extra
$1.50,
that
doesn't
go
to
you
at
all.
justice
stanley
reed
it
goes
--
it
goes
to
other
people.
justice
stanley
reed
without
--
without
the
$1.50?
it's
$8.27,
isn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
plus
$1.50.
justice
stanley
reed
and
the
rail
is
$9.18.
justice
stanley
reed
all
right.
