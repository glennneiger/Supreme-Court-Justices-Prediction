unknown
speaker
who
--
who
says
that,
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
the
danville
--
the
danville
carriers
are
not
originators
of
any
traffic
from
galveston
in
that
area
down
there.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
--
but
they
don't
--
unknown
speaker
they
don't
reach
the
galveston
area
at
all.
unknown
speaker
there
is
one
from
the
sulphur
plant,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i
mean
taking
it
up
to
danville,
not
to
east
st.louis.
unknown
speaker
there
--
there,
you've
got
a
through
rate
or
joint
rate
--
unknown
speaker
now,
what
--
what
i
asked
you
was
if
there
was
--
there
was
no
originating
carrier
between
the
east
st.louis
and
danville
that
had
originated
the
sulphur
down
at
the
shipping
point
near
galveston.
as
i
understand
it,
all
--
all
the
carriage,
rail
carriage
between
east
st.louis
and
danville
was
done
by
roads
that
take
it
from
other
roads.
unknown
speaker
the
connection.
unknown
speaker
also,
none
of
those
are
originating
railroads.
unknown
speaker
they
charge
the
$2.95.
unknown
speaker
the
danville
carriers,
from
east
st.louis
to
danville.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes,
that's
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
--
but
that's
all
in
arrangements,
so
they
don't
have
any
advantage
from
being
the
originators
of
the
shipment.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
well,
it
is
your
position
that
3
(4)
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything
except
rates.
unknown
speaker
do
not
discriminate
in
their
rates
or
charges.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
--
is
the
--
unknown
speaker
is
the
--
both
traffic,
the
river
traffic
a
connecting
line
--
unknown
speaker
--
with
--
with
the
carriers
from
east
st.louis
to
danville?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
say
and
shall
not
discriminate
in
the
rate
--
the
rates
and
charges
between
connecting
lines.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
i
understood
that
but
if
the
charges
--
is
this
a
charge
that
they
make,
it
isn't
a
rate?
unknown
speaker
out
of
the
bonus
where
the
--
if
you
get
anywhere
about
even
with
the
railroad
rate,
that
would
be
giving
them
a
bonus,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
well,
what
--
what
is
the
percentage
rate
of
sulphur
as
against
to
--
what
do
you
call
it,
first
class
rate?
unknown
speaker
about
30%
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
--
let's
assume,
i'm
not
--
unknown
speaker
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
right
either.
but
let's
assume
starting
with
that.
then
what
--
when
did
this
rate
figure
that
they
have
there
now,
the
depressed
rate?
a
rate
that
wasn't
depressed
would
be
30%
of
the
first
class
rate,
wasn't
it?
galveston
to
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
now,
how
much
has
been
depressed
below
that,
percentage
wise
or
do
we
know?
unknown
speaker
now,
there
is
no
depressed
rate
between
east
st.
louis
and
danville,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
that
mean
--
that
means
joliet
has
the
same
rate?
unknown
speaker
danville
is
farther
south
than
joliet?
unknown
speaker
not
as
long
haul.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
contract
is
only
from
port
sulphur,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
it
comes
from
galveston.
unknown
speaker
well,
these
--
what
these
people
asked
for
was
a
--
was
a
making
of
a
rate,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
--
i'm
--
unknown
speaker
--
looking
at
their
complaint,
which
--
which
asked
only
for
through
routes
and
joint
rates.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
--
you
refused
them
the
through
route,
the
joint
rate
or
the
commission
did?
unknown
speaker
the
commission
refused
it
on
the
basis
of
3
(4),
section
3
(4),
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
so,
really,
what
--
what
they
have
to
do
--
or
is
it
correct
to
say
that
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
decide
whether
3
(4)
applies
to
the
through
and
joint
rates
of
theirs?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
25
on?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
all
right.
