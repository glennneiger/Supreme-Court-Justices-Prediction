i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
distinctly.
i
understand
--
as
i
--
do
i
understand
correctly
that
if
there's
rail
transportation
from
the
mines
in
texas
straight,
that
is
a
--
a
fully
rail
haul
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
texas
to
danville?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
on
a
single
rate,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
joint
rate.
what
you've
just
said
is
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
was
the
length
of
the
stretch,
the
rail
stretch
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville
not
only
gives
the
same
service
but
involves
the
same
cost?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
--
the
actual
transportation
cost
of
the
rail
portion
of
a
full
rail
transportation
beginning
in
texas,
full
rail
transportation
expenditure
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville
is
for
the
railroad
the
same
as
the
expenditure
for
the
rail
haul
after
the
transfer
from
the
barge
to
the
rails,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
whatever
may
be
the
haul
from
texas
from
the
mines
to
danville,
it
falls
to
the
haul
--
well,
it
falls
to
the
haul
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville,
is
physically
precisely
the
same
as
that
segregated
haul
when
it
comes
up
by
barge
from
the
south.
justice

i
--
justice

i
don't
know
what
that
means
particularly
(voice

--
justice

pardon
me?
justice

but
i
don't
understand
that.
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
if
this
is
part
of
an
interstate
rate,
how
can
it
be
--
not
be
published,
can
be
allowed
to
move
on?
justice
felix

but
this
is
--
but
this
is
a
division.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
not
--
divisions
also
have
to
be
published?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
the
commission
said
it
has
power
to
determine
divisions?
justice
felix

but
divisions
need
not
be

justice

come
in

say,
you
claim

“this

is
that
it?
justice

mr.

don't
want
to

--
but
i
must
say
this
becomes

i
should
have
known
it
but
i
didn't.
it
merely
supplies
the
what
i
suppose
divisions
partly
operated
with
pressure
on

don't
they?
justice

the
relation
that
the
division
among
carriers
in
dividing
the

total
of
the

have
some
influence

justice

yes.
justice

well,
if
--
or
if
the
carrier
is
generous,
he
wants
to
give
his
connecting
carriers
the
terminal
or
the
series
of
connections,
a
generous
division,
he
will
get
it
out
of
the
rate
and
that
will
certainly
be
reflected
in
the
rate
that's
filed
that
mr.

has
(voice

--
justice

--
i'd
take
the
words
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
carrier
brings
in
the
all

mode
of
transportation?
what
carrier
comes
to
east

louis?
justice

what's
the
name
of
the

what
i
want
to
--
justice

frankfurter
and
what
carrier
--
carrier
just
connects
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville?
justice
felix

then
--
then
what
you're
complaining
of
is
that
the
new
york
central
to

road
shares
with
that
connection
to
carriers
for
their

something
they
could

by
changing
the

they
could
meet
your
purpose,
couldn't
they?
justice

that
is
--
that
is
your
point
of
business.
if
they
change
their
divisions
and
their
divisions
and
the
divisions
are
secret
as
an
internal

intra-railroad
affair,
how
can
you
even
claim
a
discrimination?
justice
felix

well,
i
--
i'm
--
justice

i've
been
puzzled
here
because
it
gets
back
to
my
earlier
question.
i'm
still
(voice

--
justice

i
mean
they
could
ascertain
here
what
the
division
(voice

--
justice

but
how
--
how
do
you
know
that
they're
giving
their
connecting
carrier
but
that
they're
retaining
for
the
service
--
the
identical
service,
if
you
please,
of
the
stuff
or
the
sulphur
they
carry
after
the

after
it
goes

it?(voice

--
justice

they
take

and
they
take
over

from
barges
and
then
carry
it

justice

how
do
you
know

how

in

in
what
they're
charging
for
that

east

justice

tomorrow
they
could

you'd

and
that
order
would
be
satisfied
from
your

they

i
don't

justice

no,
no,
i'm
talking

it

all

that's

you

justice
felix

well,
in
--
the
tap
line
cases
were
real,
honest
in
regard
to
severe
discrimination
among
different
connecting
carriers.
justice
felix

not
on
this
point.
they
were
--
that
wasn't
at
form,
is
it,
it
could
be
cured
by
changing
the
divisions.
those
are
real
divisions
in
the
tap
line
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
that's
my
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
different
carriers
were
differently
treated
by
the
connection
with
the
tap
line
cases
and
it's
very
thin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
joint
--
the
joint
(inaudible)
all
i'm
suggesting
is
they're
encompassed
by
that
and
stayed
out
of
the
tap

cases.
justice

when
did
this
joint

--
what's
the
date
of
that?
how
long
is
that
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
in
directive.
does
the
record
indicate
whether
that
joint
all-rail
was
directed
against
the
barge
competition.
justice
felix

you
mean,
commodity
in
general,
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
sulphur.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
wait
a
minute.
they
froze
them
out,
that
means
if
it
--
if
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
move
slowly
by
rail
then
a
shipper
--
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
ship
by

or
not,
doesn't
it?
and
unless

gets

he
gets

--
time

is
no

more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix

mr.
friedman,
must
the
joint
rate
necessarily
be
lower
than
the
constituent
local?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix

physically,
they
are
identical.
justice

but
what
--
what
are
the
differences
that
you
suggest
in
here?
justice

it's
noted
all
the
costs
of
--
we
were
told
that
the
cost
of
transfer
were
absorbed
by
the
barges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
inconvenient
difficulty?
justice
felix

delay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
on
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
relevant
to
the
establishment
of
through
routes
and
joint
rates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
that
there's
a
discrimination
in
the
rate,
because
they
have
to
pay
the
local
rates,
because
of
the
refusal
of
the
danville
road
to
enter
into
a
joint
--
through
routes
and
joint
rates
whereby
they
would
pay
less,
would
it
be
a
legal
through
rate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
has
taken
care
of
the
argument
when
they
accept
your
proposition
that
divisions
are
not
rates
if
in
here,
it's
well
and
good.
my
complaint
is
not
the
rate
or
device,
but
by
this
motive
dividing,
i
have
to
pay
$2.95,
which
is
more
than
i
would
have
to
pay
if
you
would
give
us
the
joint
through
--
through
routes
to
joint
rates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
--
the
other
--
the
thing
is,
concededly
for
the
same
physical
circuit,
the
same
circuit,
x
part
traffic,
pay
$2.95.
and
concededly,
that
point
that
the
through
rates
(inaudible)
because
there
is
a
joint
--
through
routes
and
a
joint
rate.
and
therefore,
either
none
--
of
the
denial
of
the
through
routes
and
joint
rates,
that's
the
last
of
the
journey,
x
barge
is
in
disadvantage
in
order
to
discriminate
between
that
half
of
the
journey
in
assuming
x
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
your
answer
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
local?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
local
rates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--about
depressed
if
i
understand
you,
the
argument
--
is
this
the
argument
that
if
there
were
no
barge
traffic
competition,
and
not
only
the
local
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville,
but
the
joint
rates
from
galveston
to
danville
would
be
higher
than
it
is
with
(inaudible)
because
then
the
railroad
could
charge
more
without
pure
competition.
in
order
to
meet
the
competition
of
a
water
traffic,
the
joint
rates
as
well
as
the
local,
could
find
a
local,
say,
has
been
reduced
in
order
not
to
be
outdone
in
order
to
have
any
traffic,
that's
against
the
barge.
is
that
the
answer
to
that
rate,
description
of
what
you've
meant
by
this
rate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
it
is
--
my
suggestion
is,
that
if
you
--
if
the
railroad,
the
danville
road
was
compelled
to
have
a
joint
rate
with
the
barge.
the
fact
would
still
--
would
still
be
further
lower
to
give
that
--
that
is
still
further
(inaudible)
advantage
of
the
barge
rate
and
still
further
cut
in
the
competitive
function
or
the
competitive
trust
of
barge
as
against
rail
traffic,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
howell,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
saw
--
i
saw
that
in
the
direction
of
your
argument
and
i
unduly
interrupted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
problem,
which
is
immediate
--
a
problem
immediately
before
us
relates
to
sulphur,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
problem,
namely,
the
relationship
between
rail
and
barge
and
the
gradual
disadvantage,
economically
speaking,
of
railroads
because
of
traffic
and
against
barge,
do
this
problem
arise
in
connection
with
other
commodities
so
that
one
may
--
one
may
have
to
reflect
that
what
is
involved
here
is
an
application
or
--
or
an
enforcement
by
the
commission
since
the
1940
act
that
they
must
as
it
were,
try
to
maintain
both
rail
privilege
as
well
as
barge
privilege?
what
i
want
to
know
is,
is
this
sulphur,
this
segregated
sulphur
problem
an
aspect
of
a
lighter
problem,
which
is
whether
explicitly
are
not
reflected
in
the
commission
report
that
they're
trying
to
do
that
what
they
did
here
have
a
relation
to
a
maintenance
of
the
economy
of
--
of
the
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
howell,
does
the
record
--does
the
record
show
--
i
haven't
read
it,
does
the
record
give
any
light
on
the
question
put
by
mr.
justice
black,
namely,
has
there
been
a
diminution
in
barge
traffic
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
at
large,
i
mean,
with
reference
to
this
commodity,
is
this
--
is
this
case
based
on
the
fact
that
this
operates
--
shows
the
barges
can't
do
business
or
business
profit?
how
long
are
these
rates
--
through
respective
rates
can
enforce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
never?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
never?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
railroad
--
did
the
railroad
driven
off
the
barge
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
no
light
on
this
--
on
this
--
what
seems
to
me
to
be
a
rather
underlying
problem
before
the
commission.
is
there
no
lighting
or
i
say
as
to
what
the
actual
economic
effect,
the
transportation
effects
have
been
on
rates,
as
you
said
in
an
existent
form
of
10
years,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
daily,
if
--
if
the
demand
of
the
barge
lines
for
a
joint
rail
rate
were
exceeded
here,
then
what
you
suggest,
these
are
the
barges
that
would
have
an
equally
larger
share
by
way
of
division?
it
would
not
have
to
be
heeded
because
the
commission
can
then
fix
upon
a
complaint,
whatever
may
be
the
private
rate,
the
commission
can
fix
the
appropriate
division
as
standard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
if
they
ordered,
they
want
to
order
a
joint
rate,
wouldn't
follow
that
the
barges
would
get
a
larger
share
out
of
the
joint
rates
they
may
now
get
out
of
the
locals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
do
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)?
why
do
they
have
to
have
it?
the
commission
could
deny
it
here,
give
them
only
some
--
some
(inaudible)
out
of
the
package.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean,
from
their
selfish
point
of
view,
from
their
business
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
these
people
of
the
old
at
that
time,
don't
know
what
are
self-business
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
--
is
that
--
the
contract
carrier
has
now
have
this
tonnage?
justice
felix
frankfurter
today
or
anything
that's
in
this

or
is
your
--
justice

--
your
$4.65,
is
that
a

is
that
a
real
opinion
to
this
thing,
or
is
that
a
--
justice

what
--
justice
felix

what
about
the
contract
carrier?
is
there
a
contract

business
of
sulphur
from
galveston
and
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
amount
as
competitors
who
are
being
the
common
carrier
barges?
your
argument,
the
last
few
minutes
was
that
what
area
you're
worrying
about
is
the
cheaper
haul
by
the
contract
carriers
and
they
can
be
protected
by
joint
rates
which
wouldn't
go
for
the
benefit
of
the
contract
carriers.
they
put
them
out
of
business
and
then
sell
out
(inaudible)
is
that
--
justice

what
--
is
that
true
today?
is
that
in
the

justice
felix

if
i
find

i
find

i

justice

how
much

go
to

goes
