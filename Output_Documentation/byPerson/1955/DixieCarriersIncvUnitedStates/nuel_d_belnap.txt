mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas,
three
judges
sitting
which
dismissed
an
action
brought
by
the
appellants
to
set
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that
order
in
turn
was
entered
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
way
of
a
formal
complaint
by
the
appellants
against
four
railroads,
which
are
among
the
appellees
here.
if
the
court
will
permit,
i
would
like
to
follow
this
plan
of
argument.
i
will
first
describe
the
rate
structure
which
led
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
then
deal
with
the
issues
of
the
complaint,
the
disposition
made
by
the
commission
of
those
issues
and
finally
with
the
errors
of
law
on
which
we
rely
for
reversal
of
the
district
court.
the
appellants
collectively
are
common
carriers
by
water,
operate
a
barge
service
from
galveston,
texas.
i
have
a
diagram
on
(inaudible)
gulf
from
galveston,
texas
by
the
intracoastal
canal
to
new
orleans
and
thus
to
east
st.
louis.
at
east
st.
louis,
they
connect
with
alliance
of
the
four
railroads
which
were
the
defendants
in
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
and
those
railroads,
new
york
central
and
others,
operate
rail
routes
from
east
st.
louis,
illinois
to
danville,
illinois.
and
i
shall
hereinafter
refer
to
them
as
the
danville
railroads.
there
is
a
receiver
of
sulphur
at
danville
who
uses
about
20,000
tons
a
year
which
we
--
that
sulphur
is
received
from
sulphur
mines
in
texas
in
the
vicinity
of
galveston.
he
has
available
two
types
of
routes.
one
is
an
all-rail
route
from
the
mines
via
east
st.
louis.
it's
composed
of
various
southwestern
railroads
and
mines
up
to
east
st.
louis.
beyond
east
st.
louis
is
composed
of
the
rails
of
the
danville
railroad.
he
also
has
available
a
barge-rail
route
composed
of
the
services
of
the
appellants,
as
i
have
described
them
to
you,
to
east
st.
louis
and
hence
the
same
services
of
the
danville
railroads
to
destination.
i
should
note
that
that
route,
that
barge-rail
route
starts
at
galveston.
it
does
not
start
at
the
mines.
there
is
an
antecedent
rail
haul
from
the
mine
at
the
galveston,
a
distance
of
about
60
miles.
it's
secured
by
the
shipper
who
maintains
storage
stocks
on
the
piers
and
wharves
at
galveston.
and
by
reason
of
the
cost
of
that
rail
haul,
the
handling
of
the
sulphur
and
the
rental
of
the
piers,
the
price
of
sulphur
at
galveston
is
$1.50
higher
for
shipment
by
barge
than
it
is
at
the
mines
for
shipment
by
rail.
as
i
said
that
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
the
selling
price.
the
selling
price
of
the
sulphur
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
the
buyer
has
to
pay
if
he's
going
to
ship
by
barge
in
galveston.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
they
are
sent
to
galveston
by
the
producer
and
put
in
storage
there.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
no,
there's
no
water
service
in
the
mines,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
no
rail
water
rail
route
because
as
--
that
the
sulphur
goes
in
the
storage
at
danville
and
it's
a
reshipment
from
that
point.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
no
storage
in
transit.
there's
no
arrangement
between
the
railroads
from
--
from
the
mines
at
galveston
and
these
barge
lines.
that
factor
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
we
are
not
involved
at
all
except
in
this
situation,
your
honor.
that
$1.50
is
necessarily
a
factor
in
the
shipper's
choice
of
the
route
but
only
in
that
respect.
the
services
of
the
danville
railroads
are
identical
regardless
of
the
mode
of
transportation
to
danville
or
who
may
be
its
connecting
carriers.
if
it
moves
to
east
st.
louis
that
is
the
service
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville
are
identical
regardless
of
the
service
up
to
east
st.
louis.
if
the
service
up
to
east
st.
louis
is
by
barge,
then
the
barge
lines,
out
of
their
rate
to
that
point
or
out
of
a
division
if
they
have
a
joint
rate,
pay
for
the
cost
of
transferring
the
sulphur
from
barges
to
railcars
and
the
switching
of
those
railcars
onto
the
rails
of
the
danville
railroads.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
the
barge
lines
absorb
those
costs.
now,
it
would
seem
to
follow
under
that
circumstance
that
if
the
danville
lines
are
equitably
compensated
by
their
various
connecting
lines,
they
cannot
be
concerned
with,
affected
by
or
have
any
interest
in
who
may
be
the
type
of
carrier
or
the
particular
carrier
that
brings
the
traffic
to
them.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
a
complete
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
correct,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
a
joint
rate
that
i
shall
describe
to
you.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
it
involves
the
same
--
the
cost
--
same
cost
were
incurred
by
the
railroads
performing
the
service.
the
traffic
pays
a
different
cost
and
that
is
the
source
of
our
complaint
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
a
minute,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
for
the
east
st.
louis
danville
haul
that
is
so.
and
i
have
laid
before
you
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
exactly
so,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
and
i
have
laid
before
you
a
chart
which
depicts
the
rate
situation
which
was
a
subject
to
the
complaint.
it's
divided
to
three
sections,
i,
ii
and
iii
by
roman
numerals.
the
first
section
of
the
chart
deals
with
the
all-rail
versus
the
barge-rail
situation.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
i'd
have
the
clerk
lay
a
small
one-sheet
page
before
you
for
a
ready
reference.
the
rail
joint
rate
from
the
mines
is
$1.18
and
these
are
for
gross
ton.
all
my
figures
are
for
gross
ton,
if
you
please.
and
then
in
making
that
rate,
there
is
a
shrink
of
$2.50
below,
the
combination
of
rail
rate
to
and
from
east
st.
louis
which
would
otherwise
apply.
in
the
case
of
the
barge-rail
movement,
there
is
no
shrink.
the
danville
railroads
demand
that
the
traffic
move
on
the
full
combination
basis
which
aggregates
$8.27,
$5.32
by
rail
and
a
$2.95
local
rail
rate
from
east
st.
louis
to
danville.
when
you
add
the
$1.50
higher
price
of
the
sulphur
--
of
the
sulphur
at
galveston
which
bears
upon
the
cost
by
the
barge-rail
route,
you
come
out
at
$9.77
or
59
cents
higher
than
the
danville
railroads
in
cooperation
with
their
southwestern
connections
published
for
all-rail
application.
there
is
that
difference
in
joint
arrangements.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
it
necessarily
bears,
if
your
honor
please,
upon
the
shippers
choice
of
the
route.
he
must
pay
the
$1.50
when
he
use
the
barge-rail.
it's
a
--
it's
a
service
cost
up
to
the
storage
pile.
i
can
come
more
directly
to
the
discrimination
in
--
in
the
second
portion
of
my
rate
chart
and
that
deals
wholly
with
the
compensation
which
the
danville
railroads
demand,
dependent
upon
the
mode
of
transportation
up
to
east
st.
louis.
if
the
mode
is
by
barge,
these
appellants,
they
demand
their
full
local
rate
of
$2.95
while
that
rate
is
from
a
--
and
a
point
in
illinois.
to
a
point
in
illinois,
it
is
published
as
an
interstate
rate
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
was
characterized
by
a
railroad
witness
as
a
proportional
rate,
so
to
speak,
meaning
only
that
it
is
available
for
the
movement
of
the
sulphur
if
it's
brought
to
east
st.
louis
by
the
barge
lines
and
is
then
transported
by
these
danville
railroads
to
danville.
now,
the
record
also
shows
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
railroad
witness
that
if
the
traffic
comes
to
them
from
a
southwestern
railroad,
they
do
not
demand
the
$2.95,
they
demand
a
lower
amount
by
way
of
a
secret
contractual
division
with
their
connecting
rail
lines.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
it's
not
published.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
it's
not
published
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
it
is
not
a
separately
established
rate.
the
rate
that
is
published
is
$9.18
and
that
complies
with
the
requirements
of
section
6
insofar
as
the
rate
available
to
the
shipper
is
concerned.
the
total
rate
is
published.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
a
division
of
that
rate.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
no,
your
honor.
they
do
in
the
case
of
railway
fuel
only
because
they
were
at
one
time
found
to
be
the
source
of
discrimination
and
the
commission,
after
a
proceeding
in
this
court,
required
the
divisions
on
railway
fuel
to
be
published.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
it
has
power
to
determine
divisions.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
need
not
be
published
except
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
they
can
go
to
the
commission
when
there
are
two
carriers
with
two
joint
rate,
two
different
connected
carriers
with
join
rates
and
--
and
they
think
the
divisions
between
them
are
inequitable.
they
can
go
to
the
commission,
yes,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
we
now
have
a
combination
rate.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
that
is
not
a
published
rate.
we
believe
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
--
it's
a
division.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
yes,
we
had
a
hearing.
it
was
not
disclosed
by
the
railroad
witness.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
if
you
ask
a
railroad
witness
what
the
division,
he
will
refuse
to
answer
and
up
to
this
point
isn't
so
clear,
the
commission
was
sustaining
on
the
ground
that
it's
none
of
the
barge
line's
business.
that
has
happened
recently
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
that
is
because
of
the
view
of
the
commission
as
to
the
status
of
a
division
which
is
the
source
of
our
complaint
to
the
commission.
we
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
i
--
i
don't
believe
i
understood
the
inquiry,
sir?
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
in
this
--
in
a
sense
that
if
a
carrier
demands
more
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
--
and
his
connecting
line
won't
give
it
to
him,
he
cannot
get
it
unless
the
rate
is
increased.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
they
--
they
can
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
we
believe
that
division
to
be
$2.26.
and
we
believe
it
for
this
reason,
there
is
a
joint
rate
between
the
barge
lines
and
the
danville
railroads
from
port
sulphur,
a
point
on
the
mississippi
river
below
new
orleans,
an
important
shipping
point.
that
joint
rate
is
$6.66,
i
noted
at
the
foot
of
my
rate
chart.
out
of
that
joint
rate
voluntarily
agreed
to,
there
is
an
agreed
division
to
the
danville
lines
of
$2.26
and
we
are
confident
that
in
view
of
their
general
attitude
towards
barge
lines,
they
would
not
accept
any
lesser
division
in
connection
with
the
barge
line
and
the
--
except
with
railroads
for
an
identical
service.
but
the
important
circumstances
stands
here
among
these
facts
by
which
i've
--
which
i've
told
you
is
that
the
compensation
of
the
danville
lines
is
less
when
the
traffic
is
received
from
a
rail
connecting
line
and
when
received
from
a
barge
connecting
line.
with
the
rates
in
this
situation,
the
shipper
requested
the
barge
lines
to
work
out
a
joint
rate
arrangement.
the
barge
line
suggested
the
railroad
that
they
make
the
joint
rate
from
galveston
$7.67,
based
$1.01
over
that
$6.66
rate
from
port
sulphur.
that
is
the
common
relation
of
galveston
to
port
sulphur
in
connection
with
the
all
water
rates
which
the
barge
line
maintain
to
various
ports
of
destination.
if
the
railroads
had
established
that
rate,
then
the
cost
of
the
shipper
for
barge-rail
service,
after
you
have
the
$1.50,
would've
been
$9.17
or
almost
the
real
rate.
nevertheless,
the
receiver
at
danville
advised
the
barge
lines
that
if
the
joint
rate
suggested
were
established,
the
barge
lines
would
obtain
part
of
the
business
that
comes
from
this
circumstance.
the
texas
producer
of
sulphur
is
in
competition
with
the
port
sulphur
producer
of
sulphur.
and
in
order
to
be
on
a
common
price
basis,
he
absorbs
the
$1.01
rate
difference.
with
that
absorption,
instead
of
$9.17,
the
cost
of
the
receiver
would
be
$8.16
or
$1.02
below
the
all-rail
joint
rates
to
the
mines.
and
the
shipper
advised
these
barge
lines
that
if
that
level
were
established,
the
saving
would
induce
him
to
give
part
of
his
traffic
to
the
barge
groups.
the
railroads
refused
that
request.
thereupon,
these
four
barge
lines,
two
on
the
canal
and
two
on
the
mississippi,
brought
their
complaint
before
the
commission.
their
allegations
fall
into
two
categories.
first,
they
alleged
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
the
--
the
shipper.
the
texas
--
the
texas
producer.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
in
order
to
be
competitive
with
port
sulphur.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
the
complaint
before
the
commission
alleged
were
in
two
categories.
there
were
allegations
of
unreasonableness
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
act.
and
the
commission
was
asked
to
exercise
the
power
conferred
upon
it
by
paragraph
(d)
of
section
307
which
states
as
when
there
are
barge-rail
routes
and
i
quote,
“the
commission
shall
prescribe
such
reasonable
differentials
as
it
may
find
to
be
justified
between
all-rail
rates
and
joint
rates
in
connection
with
such
common
carriers
by
water.”
then
there
were
allegations
in
another
category.
the
allegation
was
that
the
refusal
of
the
joint
rate
arrangements
led
to
a
violation
of
--
paragraph
(4)
of
section
3.
that
paragraph
as
to
carriers
subject
thereto
prohibits,
and
i
quote,
“discrimination
in
rates
and
charges
between
connecting
lines.”
and
the
paragraph
by
definition
includes,
and
i
quote,
“common
carriers
by
water
subject
to
part
3
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,”
in
the
category
of
such
connecting
lines.
the
commission
dismissed
the
complaint
in
its
entirety.
my
argument,
if
the
court
please,
will
be
confined
to
the
section
3
(4)
violation
based
on
the
difference
in
compensation,
the
full
local
in
the
one
case
and
a
lower
contractual
division
on
the
other.
mr.
friedman,
who
will
follow
me,
will
discuss
the
error
of
the
commission
in
failing
to
prescribe
a
reasonable
differential
under
section
307
(d)
and
he
will
also
deal
with
the
violation
of
section
3
(4)
which
comes
from
the
granting
of
joint
arrangements
in
one
case
and
not
in
the
other.
however,
as
to
the
latter,
i
would
like
to
make
one
point.
all
cases
in
the
commission's
books
and
in
the
books
of
this
court,
which
involved
a
failure
to
establish
joint
rate
with
one
carrier
while
maintaining
them
with
another,
had
been
found
to
be
squalling
violations
of
paragraph
(4)
of
section
3.
the
commission
excuses
that
despair
treatment
in
this
case
on
the
ground
that
the
railroad
revenue
from
the
all-railway
structure
is
a
depressed
rate
structure
because
the
rates
were
originally
established
to
meet
barge
competition.
that
is
conceded.
the
barge
competition
is
in
chicago
and
the
$9.18
rate
applied
to
danville
is
a
depressed
rate
to
chicago
to
meet
all
water
competition.
there
is
no
water
competition
at
danville,
it's
an
inland
point.
but
the
commission
says
since
these
rail
lines
have
seem
fit
to
depress
their
earnings
in
order
to
compete
with
all
water
routes,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
national
transportation
policy
requires
them
to
further
depress
their
earnings
by
joining
with
barge
lines
in
differential
rates.
if
the
court
please,
the
error
of
the
commission
in
that
finding
is
that
a
--
a
proceeding
aimed
at
removing
discrimination
is
aimed
only
at
the
relation
of
rates.
the
matter
to
be
considered
is
only
the
matter
of
equal
treatment
and
rate
levels
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject.
now,
if
i
--
if
you
please,
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
main
point
of
my
argument
to
answer
the
question,
is
discrimination
in
fact,
which
results
from
unequal
compensation
for
identical
services,
prohibited
by
section
3
(4)
of
the
act?
that
there
is
discrimination
in
fact
that
that
term
as
commonly
used
is
obvious.
it
is
equally
obvious
that
it
is
not
warranted
by
differences
in
conditions
on
the
lines
of
the
danville
railroads,
the
lines
which
occasioned
the
difference
in
treatment.
consequently,
if
that
difference
is
prohibited
by
section
3
(4)
of
the
act,
there
is
no
room
for
a
commission
discretion.
there
is
no
room
for
expertise.
as
this
court
said
in
mitchell
in
313
u.s.,
when
the
act
complained
of
is
probably
discriminatory
and
forbidden
by
the
act,
there
is
no
room
for
expertise
on
the
part
of
the
commission.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
the
difference
is
not
denied.
the
commission
dismisses
this
proceeding
as
to
the
issue
i'm
discussing
on
a
lack
of
jurisdiction.
i
quote
on
page
35
of
my
brief
the
false
statement
of
the
commission
on
the
point.
they
find
in
effect
that
if
we
--
if
--
if
we
were
subject
both
of
us
to
join
rates
and
the
divisions
were
disparate,
then
we
can
have
relief.
they
find
in
effect
that
if
there
were
no
joined
rates
with
either
set
of
connecting
carriers
but
they
were
disparate
separately
established
rates,
then
we
can
have
relief.
but
the
commission
says
when
the
disparity
is
brought
about
as
here
by
a
division
in
the
connection
with
the
rail
lines
lower
than
the
separately
established
rate
that
discrimination
is
beyond
remedy.
it
is
not
within
the
scope
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
two
sentence
in
which
they
make
the
finding
read
as
follows,
"the
comparison
is
between
a
rate
or
charge
paid
by
a
shipper
and
a
division
of
a
joint
rate
received
by
rail
carriers
and
is
of
unlike
things."
basically,
divisions
of
joint
rates
are
the
result
of
contractual
arrangement
between
carriers.
they
are
not
rates
or
charges
as
those
terms
are
used
in
section
3
(4)
of
the
act.
but,
if
your
honor
please,
these
are
not
unlike
things
as
to
these
appellants.
we
are
injured
grievously.
we
are
disadvantaged
just
as
much
and
there
is
equal
restraint
upon
the
movement
of
this
traffic
by
the
barge-rail
routes
whether
the
discrimination
is
practiced
in
the
form
here
or
whether
it
is
simply
practiced
as
it
was
in
the
mechling
case,
as
to
certain
portion
of
the
mechling
case
by
unequal
charges
separately
established.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
well,
the
sharp
route
is
defined
in
the
commission's
report
as
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
missouri
pacific
for
instance.
the
missouri
pacific
lines.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
new
york
central.
the
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
we
wouldn't
have
the
point
i
have
here.
the
point
of
unequal
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
well,
that
has
--
i
--
i
can
call
your
attention
to
two
circumstances
involving
divisions
where
there
was
complaint
of
discrimination
and
remedied
by
the
commission.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
one
is
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
the
--
the
publication
does
not
prevent
the
commission
from
ascertaining
the
divisions
if
it
chose,
if
it
ruled
differently
than
it
has
here.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
missouri
pacific.
because
they
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
we
know
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
because
they
say
so
at
page
104
of
the
record.
they
say
they
are
taking
less
from
their
rail
connections
than
they
are
taking
in
the
barge
line
connection.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
we
might
have
a
different
complaint
and
if
we
had
an
order,
the
commission
might
have
to
amend
this
order.
the
order
in
this
case,
as
far
as
the
point
i
am
discussing,
is
a
cease
and
desist
order.
we
have
another
element
to
this
case
that
mr.
friedman
will
discuss.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
but
if
i
can
stick
just
to
my
point.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
all
we
want,
as
far
as
my
point
is
concerned,
is
a
cease
and
desist
order.
don't
charge
this
--
this
barge
traffic
any
different
amount
than
you
charge
all
rail
traffic
in
the
absence
of
a
difference
in
cost.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
we
would
--
we
would
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
sure,
we
wouldn't
have
a
complaint
about
it
then,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
we
still
have
our
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
all
right.
your
honor,
all
we
can
ask
is
equality
of
treatment
and
if
the
standard
changes
then
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
if
they
--
if
they
increase
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
no,
it
would
not.
but
as
long
as
they
charge
the
missouri
pacific,
what
we
think
is
$2.26,
we
say
it's
a
plain
violation
of
3
(4)
not
to
charge
the
same
on
the
barge
traffic.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
and
we
--
it
will
be
practical
equality
in
the
operation
of
this
thing,
your
honor,
sir.
the
commission
makes
its
opinion
turn
on
form,
not
on
substance.
yet,
prior
to
1920,
when
the
commission
for
the
first
time
was
given
authority
over
divisions
separate
and
apart
from
rates,
it
held
in
western
pacific
versus
southern
pacific,
55
icc
71,
in
a
dispute
about
divisions
when
the
first
question
post
was
did
the
commission
have
jurisdiction
and
the
commission
held
it
did
on
the
ground
that
divisions
were
rates
and
charges
within
the
meaning
of
those
terms
as
used
in
the
very
paragraph
on
which
we
rely.
and
i
call
your
honors'
attention
in
brief
that
in
the
cases
which
the
official
reporter
named
the
tap
line
cases
in
this
court
in
234
u.s.,
cited
in
1914,
this
court
held
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
the
authority
and
it
is
its
duty
to
reach
all
unlawful
discriminatory
practices
resulting
in
favoritism
and
unfair
advantages
to
particular
shippers
or
carriers
and
the
discrimination
in
that
case
was
in
the
matter
of
divisions.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
and
there's
a
very
real
and
severe
discrimination
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
commission
changed
the
form
of
it
by
changing
the
rail
divisions
and
put
them
on
a
realistic
basis
and
that
was
the
order
in
the
tap
line
cases.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
they
--
they
changed
them
to
a
non-discriminatory
basis.
that's
all
we
ask
in
this
case.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
exactly
so.
and
it
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
then
might
i
recall
to
your
honors,
mind
the
mechling
case
in
330
u.s.
which
in
principle
and
in
fact
involved
a
situation
like
that
here.
in
that
case,
the
commission
had
proscribed
or
approved
on
barge
traffic
to
the
east
from
chicago
grain,
higher
separately
established
rates
that
were
applied
on
all-rail
traffic
from
that
territory
west
of
the
mississippi
river
where
the
all-rail
traffic
moved
on
combination
rates.
this
court
struck
that
down
on
the
ground
that
it
was
in
the
absence
of
a
difference
in
cost,
there
could
be
no
difference
in
the
compensation
exactly.
if
your
honor
please,
in
that
same
case,
from
points
in
illinois,
there
were
no
combination
rates
on
grain
by
rail
application.
they
were
joint
through
rates
with
divisions
with
eastern
lines.
the
commission
had
approved
a
separately
established
rate
on
the
barge
traffic
higher
than
the
division.
that
was
stricken
down
by
this
court.
this
court
sustained
a
decree
of
a
lower
court
which
was
carefully
drawn
so
as
to
reach
the
divisional
aspect
of
that
case.
and
i
quote
the
part
of
it
on
page
46
and
47
of
our
brief,
“where
the
decree
in
joining
the
commission's
order
insofar
as
prescribes,
approves,
authorizes
or
(inaudible)
in
any
manner
whatever,
a
charge
for
rail
services
in
transporting
east-to-chicago,
grain
that
has
arrived
there
by
barge
that
is
higher
than
any
rate
or
charge
that
is
contemporaneously
exacted
in
any
form
and
under
any
guides
for
railroad
services
on
the
ex-rail
grain
from
the
identical
origins.”
and
i
call
your
honors'
attention,
if
the
commission
is
right
in
this
case
and
if
the
mechling
principle
doesn't
reach
this
case
as
the
point
which
i'm
discussing
then
there
can
be
a
hocus
pocus.
the
rail
lines,
east-to-chicago,
in
an
effort
to
restrain
the
barge
competition
can
join
the
western
railroads
in
joint
through
rates
and
set
their
divisions
east-to-chicago
so
as
to
impose
the
same
handicap
and
restraint
on
the
barge
servers
that
comes
from
the
unequal
separately
established
rates.
the
appellants
asked
this
court
to
reverse
the
district
court
and
direct
it
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
with
directions
to
proceed
upon
a
correct
construction
of
section
3
(4).
thank
you.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please,
just
on
the
last
point
as
to
supply
of
cars,
these
lines,
of
course,
do
not
serve
the
barge
terminals.
there's
a
switching
line
service
for
barge
terminals.
the
record
is
that
federal
barge
lines
and
american
barge
lines,
which
are
the
terminating
barge
lines
of
east
st.louis,
for
cars
supplied,
pay
per
diem,
the
usual
per
diem
rate
for
the
cars
throughout
the
terminal
and
pay
a
per
diem
reclaim
the
switching
line.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
yes,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
during
the
course
of
the
oral
argument
in
1953,
november,
mr.
daily
argued
the
case
for
the
railroads.
he
talked
about
and
i
quote,
“the
traffic
which
we
now
have
with
the
missouri
pacific.”
that's
on
the
record
139.
he
spoke
about
a
prior
movement
from
galveston
by
a
contract
carrier.
the
evidence
shows
that
in
the
latter
part
of
1950,
there
was
such
a
movement
by
a
contract
carrier.
in
the
report
of
the
commission,
upon
reconsideration
on
page
30
of
the
record,
decided
in
january
1954,
this
is
said,
“beginning
with
and
since
1951,
the
entire
movement
of
sulphur
from
the
galveston
area
approximating
20,000
tons
a
year
has
been
over
at
the
all-rail
routes.”
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
no,
sir.
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
it
all
goes
over
the
railroad.
i
think
in
the
examiner's
proposed
report,
there
was
a
statement
that
the
contract
carrier
had
gone
out
of
business.
and
in
that
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
yes,
but
i'm
going
to
--
mr.
nuel
d.
belnap
may
i
--
may
i
say
this
to
warn
the
court
about
the
misprint
in
this
record.

mr.
