this
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
and
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
which
affirmed
a
judgment
and
order
of
the
district
court
of
douglas
county,
nebraska,
permanently
enjoining
the
enforcement
or
operation
of
a
so-called
union
shop
agreement
between
the
union
pacific
railroad
and
the
organizations
constituting
the
appellants
here.
the
background
is
this.
the
original
railway
labor
act
of
1926
was
silent
on
the
question
of
whether
organizations
and
railroad
subject
to
it
should
be
permitted
to
make
union
shop
or
closed
shop
agreements.
apparently,
agreements
at
that
time
were
not
particularly
prevalent
among
the
standard
railway
labor
organizations,
although
it
is
indicated
that
there
were
some,
in
effect,
particularly
so-called
percentage
agreements
requiring
a
minimum
percentage
of
employees
to
be
union
members.
however,
what
was
prevalent
was
a
practice
of
fostering
company-dominated
unions
and
requiring
membership
in
such
unions
as
a
condition
of
employment.
primarily,
with
respect
to
that
situation,
congress
in
1934
amended
the
act
to
--
to
prohibit
completely
all
forms
of
so-called
union
security
agreement.
in
other
words,
carriers
were
prohibited
under
all
circumstances
from
in
anyway
fostering
or
encouraging
or
the
membership
or
nonmembership
in
labor
organizations.
it
outlawed
there
by
the
yellow-dog
contract
as
well
as
the
union
shop
or
closed
shop
agreements.
by
1951,
congress
took
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
the
company
union
had
to
all
intents
and
purposes
disappear.
in
the
meantime,
through
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
--
as
subsequently
amended
in
the
taft-hartley
act,
congress
had
regulated
the
extent
to
which
and
unions
in
other
industries
might
be
permitted
to
make
union
shop
agreements
and
prescribe
the
conditions
for
the
making
of
such
agreements.
taking
cognizance
of
those
circumstances,
congress
enacted
what
is
known
as
section
2,
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
that
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
--
at
page
3.
the
substance
of
section
2,
eleventh
is
that
notwithstanding
the
probations
of
any
other
federal
or
state
law,
carriers
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act
and
organizations
organized
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
that
act
may
make
agreements
requiring
as
a
condition
of
continued
employment
that
all
employees
within
60
days
after
the
making
of
the
agreement
or
within
60
days
after
they
are
employed,
become
--
and
become
members
and
continue
to
maintain
membership
in
the
organization
representing
their
craft
or
class.
when
the
law
was
thus
amended,
the
non-operating
organizations
consisting
of
the
--
of
all
but
the
last
two
of
the
appellants
in
this
case,
served
notice
on
all
the
major
railroads
that
they
wish
to
negotiate
union
shop
agreements
in
accordance
with
the
permission
conferred
by
statute.
the
railroads
by
and
large
refused
with
the
few
exceptions.
after
considerable
negotiation,
new
york
central,
in
baltimore
and
ohio,
and
the
lehigh
valley
and
a
few
smaller
roads
made
agreements
through
dealings
across
the
table.
with
respect
to
most
of
the
railroads,
however,
the
controversy
remained
unsettled
and
approximately
a
year
later,
that
is
in
1952,
the
early
part
of
1952,
the
president
appointed
emergency
board
no.98
pursuant
to
section
10
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
investigate
the
dispute
concerning
the
making
of
the
union
shop
agreements.
that
board
held
its
investigations,
made
its
recommendations
to
the
president
and
recommended
that
the
railroads
and
the
unions
should
jointly
enter
into
a
union
shop
agreement
along
the
same
lines
as
those
previously
negotiated
by
the
baltimore
and
ohio
and
new
york
central
and
the
lehigh
valley
with
some
recommended
modifications.
on
the
basis
of
the
emergency
board
report,
eventually,
regional
carriers
conference
committees
were
established
in
the
east
and
in
the
west.
no
agreement
could
be
reached
with
the
western
carriers
conference
committee,
but
in
august
of
1952,
a
group
agreement
with
the
carriers
represented
by
the
eastern
carriers
conference
committee
was
reached.
thereafter,
the
individual
railroads
in
the
west
were
asked
to
subscribe
to
agreements
in
the
same
terms
and
most
of
them
did.
the
union
pacific
was
one
and
it
included
--
it
resulted
in
the
agreement
here
in
question.
nonunion
employees
constituting
the
appellees
chose
not
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement,
but
instead,
instituted
this
suit
in
the
district
court
for
douglas
county,
nebraska.
and
in
so
doing,
claimed
that
the
enforcement
of
the
agreement
was
contrary
to
their
rights
under
the
nebraska
constitution
and
statute
which
prohibits
any
discrimination
in
employment
on
the
basis
of
membership
or
nonmembership
in
a
labor
organization
and
which
prohibits
specifically
any
agreement
providing
for
any
such
discrimination.
the
answers
of
both
the
union
pacific
and
the
--
and
the
unions
challenged
the
applicability
of
the
nebraska
law
and
set
up
as
an
authoritative
and
valid
basis
for
the
making
of
the
agreement
in
question,
the
federal
statute.
in
turn,
the
appellees
challenged
the
validity
of
the
federal
statute
both
as
being
not
a
proper
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
and
as
being
violative
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendments
as
well
as
on
other
grounds.
the
district
court
of
douglas
county
found
in
favor
of
the
appellees
and
entered
a
permanent
injunction.
and
that,
as
i
say,
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
in
the
decision
here
under
review.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
apparently
recognized
that
congress
had
the
power
in
the
course
of
the
regulation
of
labor
relations
and
the
railroad
industry
to
regulate
the
subject
of
union
shop
agreements.
it
also
indicated
that
it
considered
union
shop
agreements
made
pursuant
to
the
taft-hartley
act
as
not
violating
any
constitutional
rights.
but
if
i
correctly
understand
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
it
holds
that
because
in
the
railway
labor
act,
congress
did
not
leave
state
laws
concurrently
to
operate
as
it
had
in
taft-hartley
but
instead
expressly
preempted
the
field
that
thereby
--
therefore,
the
congressional
permission
to
make
these
agreements
must
be
tested
in
the
same
manner
constitutionally
as
though
it
had
specifically
required
by
law
that
every
employee
be
a
member
of
the
union
as
a
condition
of
his
employment.
now,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
is
so
plainly
wrong
that
it
takes
but
brief
comment
to
demonstrate.
certainly,
the
power
of
congress
has
a
part
of
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
to
include
in
its
regulation
the
manner
in
which
employer-employee
relations
are
conducted,
is
too
well-established
to
be
subject
to
questions
at
this
time.
the
court
has
specifically
passed
on
it
a
number
of
times
first
in
texas
and
new
orleans
against
brotherhood
of
railway
&
steamship
clerks
and
subsequently
again
in
the
virginian
railway
against
system
federation
no.
40.
and
that
subject
matter
has
included,
at
least
since
1934,
the
specific
regulation
of
the
subject
of
union
shop
agreements
or
closed
shop
agreements.
as
i've
indicated
before
under
sections
2,
fourth
and
fifth
prior
to
the
1934
amendment,
such
agreements
were
entirely
prohibited.
now,
congress
has
not,
at
this
time,
simply
turned
loose
of
the
subject
matter
and
ceased
to
regulate
it.
it
has
prescribed
in
detail
the
precise
terms
that
may
be
embodied
in
such
an
agreement
and
has
said
such
agreements
shall
be
permitted
to
be
made
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
federal
or
state
law.
and
incidentally,
it
was
found
in
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
1936
that
the
enactment
of
the
1934
prohibition
invalidated
existing
checkoff
agreements
then
in
effect.
that
was
in
the
case
of
brotherhood
railroad
shop
crafts
against
lowden,
86
f
.2d,
458.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
controversy
at
the
present
time
that
section
2,
eleventh
does
in
fact
render
state
laws
inapplicable
if
it
is
not
itself
unconstitutional.
at
one
time,
that
was
my
matter
in
controversy
in
this
case
but
as
i
read
the
opinion
below
and
the
--
and
the
briefs
of
the
appellees,
that
appears
no
longer
to
be
contentious.
certainly,
it
seems
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
it
could
be,
in
light
of
the
express
language
of
congress
which
says
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
any
other
law
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
state.
and
the
legislative
history
fully
supports
that
that
was
intended
to
mean
exactly
what
it
says.
so
we
come
to
the
question,
is
there
any
constitutional
infirmity
in
the
enactment
of
section
2,
eleventh?
the
appellees
assert
that
it
violates
first
and
fifth
amendment
guarantees
because
the
right
to
work
and
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
are
limited
through
union
shop
agreements.
those
contentions
seem
to
me
completely
flimsy.
in
the
first
place,
union
shop
agreements
are
not
themselves
government
act
and
they
do
not
become
the
equivalent
of
government
statutes
merely
because
entered
into
pursuant
to
the
authority
conferred
by
federal
law.
that
may
be
illustrated
with
respect
to
any
other
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
make
agreements
all
the
time,
fixing
wages,
working
conditions,
and
other
conditions
of
employment,
the
number
of
hours
per
week
and
the
rights
of
pay.
now,
if
congress
were
to
take
direct
congressional
action
to
fix
the
rates
of
pay
or
to
fix
the
hours
of
employment
as
it
did
in
the
adamson
act,
then
of
course,
immediately
constitutional
questions
arise
as
to
whether
the
circumstances
warrant
that
kind
of
restriction
on
the
liberty
of
contract.
but
no
such
questions
were
asked
when
congress
leaves
it
to
the
bargaining
of
the
party.
and
in
the
same
way
when
congress
leaves
to
the
bargaining
of
the
parties,
the
question
of
whether
they
will
or
will
not
make
union
shop
agreements,
congress
has
commanded
nothing
has
restricted
no
liberties.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that
is
the
contention,
your
honor.
but
my
point
is
that
it
--
it
is
equally
true
when
--
when
we
make
an
agreement
concerning
rates
of
pay
or
other
working
conditions.
the
other
individuals
in
the
craft
or
class
may
not
like
it.
they
may
not
like
the
rate
of
pay.
they
may
not
like
the
conditions
of
employment.
when
we
put
in
the
40-hour
week,
there
may
have
been
many
who
would
have
preferred
to
continue
to
work
to
48
if
they
can.
and
that
was
done
pursuant
to
the
same
statutory
scheme
that
is
involved
here.
now,
the
--
the
claim,
in
other
words,
becomes
essentially
a
claim
on
constitutional
grounds
to
have
congress
prohibit
union
shop
agreements.
and
we
say
that
they
have
no
constitutional
claim
to
have
congress
prohibit
anything.
now,
this
court
has
had
occasion
before
to
deal
with
the
question
of
the
union
shop
and
closed
shop
agreements.
under
the
wagner
act,
closed
shop
agreements
requiring
as
a
condition
of
initial
employment,
membership
in
the
union
and
permitting
expulsion
from
the
union
of
members
and
consequent
loss
of
employment
was
permitted.
and
bear
in
mind
that
under
the
wagner
act,
the
collective
bargaining
agent
was
as
much
closed
with
the
statutory
authority
of
being
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
as
the
union
is
under
the
railway
labor
act.
nevertheless,
this
court
had
before
it
in
colgate-palmolive-peet
company
against
national
labor
relations
board,
cited
at
page
14
of
our
brief,
a
situation
in
which
a
closed
shop
agreement
had
been
made.
and
then
at
a
time
which
was
appropriate
for
seeking
a
change
in
bargaining
representation,
employees
who
agitated
for
a
different
representative
were
expelled
from
their
union
and
were
fired
from
their
jobs.
the
national
labor
relations
board
held
that
that
was
not
--
or
that
that
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
notwithstanding
the
permission
in
the
act
to
make
closed
shop
agreements.
they
said
they
had
to
reconcile
it
with
the
freedom
of
association,
the
freedom
of
organization
provided
in
section
7
of
the
act.
this
court
said
the
board
was
wrong
and
directed
the
enforcement
of
the
union
shop
agreement.
my
colleagues
criticized
me
for
saying
direct
to
the
enforcement
because
they
say
all
this
court
did
was
to
tell
the
board
not
to
interfere
with
its
performance.
but
that
to
my
mind
is
directing
the
enforcement
of
the
union
of
the
closed
shop
agreement.
and
in
commenting
on
the
situation,
this
court
said,
"one
of
the
oldest
techniques
in
the
art
of
collective
bargaining
is
the
closed
shop.
it
protects
the
integrity
of
the
union
and
provides
stability
to
labor
relations.
to
achieve
stability
of
labor
relations
was
the
primary
objective
of
congress
in
enacting
the
national
labor
relations
act."
congress
knew
that
a
closed
shop
would
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
employes
to
organize
in
another
union
and
would
if
used,
lead
inevitably
to
discrimination
in
tenure
of
employment.
nevertheless,
with
full
realization
that
there
was
a
limitation
by
the
proviso
of
section
8,
three,
upon
the
freedom
of
section
7,
congress
inserted
the
provision
of
section
8,
three.
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
justify
the
policy
of
congress.
it
is
enough
that
we
find
it
in
the
statute.
that
policy
cannot
be
defeated
by
the
board's
policy
which
would
make
an
unfair
labor
practice
out
of
that
which
is
authorized
by
the
act.
the
board
cannot
ignore
the
plain
provisions
of
a
valid
contract
made
in
accordance
with
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
statute
and
perform
it
--
and
reform
it
to
conform
to
the
board's
idea
of
correct
policy.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not.
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
no
agreement
shall
deny
employment
or
terminate
the
employment
of
any
individual
to
whom
membership
is
not
made
available
on
the
same
terms
on
--
and
conditions
as
generally
applicable
or
whose
membership
is
denied
or
terminated
for
any
reason
other
than
failure
to
tender
periodic
dues,
initiation
fees,
and
assessments
not
including
fines
and
penalties.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
i
think
that's
what
it
comes
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
i
say
the
--
the
court
has
specifically
recognized
in
connection
with
the
wagner
act
that
even
a
closed
shop
agreement
may
be
permitted
and
that
it
is
enough
to
find
such
a
policy
in
the
statute,
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
justify.
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
noted
particularly
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
lincoln
union
northwestern
--
versus
northwestern
company
and
af
of
l
versus
american
sash
&
door
co,
you
note
it's
what
had
been
the
situation
in
the
railroad
industry
prior
to
the
1951
amendment,
which
was
still
the
situation
at
that
time,
but
felt
it
desirable
to
comment
that
the
wisdom
of
such
a
legislative
policy
is,
of
course,
not
for
us
to
judge,
again
indicating
clearly
that
this
is
a
matter
of
legislative
policy
and
not
of
limitation
upon
judicial
authority.
well
apparently,
the
opinion
below
would
recognize
everything
that
i
have
said
so
far
as
having
validity.
but
somehow,
the
court
brings
itself
to
the
conclusion
that
something
different
happens
when
congress
preempts
the
field
and
does
not
leave
state
law
free
to
operate
in
a
more
restrictive
fashion
as
is
the
case
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
can
find
no
foundation
for
any
such
view.
in
fact,
every
indication
was
to
the
contrary.
most
closely
in
point,
this
court
had
before
it
in
algoma
plywood
company
against
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
board,
336
u.s.
301,
the
specific
question
of
what
was
the
situation
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
did
it
preempt
the
field?
you
inquired
into
that
subject
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
did
not
because
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
intent
expressed.
but
there
is
certainly
no
indication
that
any
constitutional
question
would
have
arisen
had
you
found
that
the
field
was
preempted.
it
was
approached
purely
as
a
question
of
what
did
congress
intend
and
of
course
that
is
the
only
question
involved.
if
congress
intends
to
make
its
regulation
exclusive
in
a
field
where
it
has
authority
to
regulate,
no
further
action
of
congress
other
than
the
expression
of
that
intent
is
required
for
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
itself
makes
that
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
old
state
law
is
rendered
inapplicable.
now
certainly,
that
presents
no
further
constitutional
issue
with
respect
to
due
process
or
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment.
at
page
18
of
our
brief,
we
have
pointed
out
the
decisions
of
other
state
and
federal
courts
on
the
same
subject
matter.
i
will
not
recite
them
here
except
to
comment
that
the
statement
there
made,
that
the
decision
below
is
the
only
outstanding
decision
contrary
to
the
constitutionality
of
section
2,
eleventh
is
still
true.
the
only
change
in
the
status
of
the
litigation
they
have
recited
is
that
the
wicks
and
jensen
cases
referred
to
as
having
been
on
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit
have
since
been
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
on
march
the
6th
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
number
808
is
pending
in
this
court
on
those
cases.
now,
there's
one
other
point
which
the
appellees
assert
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
little
more
specifically.
it
is
claimed
that
union
shop
agreements
raised
issues
comparable
to
those
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
the
case
of
steele
against
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
company,
323
u.s.
192,
which
i'm
sure
you
all
recall
involved
agreements
discriminating
against
employees
on
account
of
race.
now,
while
that
case
was
decided
or
by
construction
of
the
statute,
the
court
clearly
intimated
that
if
the
statute
had
not
been
susceptible
to
such
a
construction
but
certainly,
a
constitutional
issue
would
have
been
presented.
now,
perhaps
it
would
be
sufficient
by
way
of
distinction
of
union
shop
agreements
from
racial
discrimination
agreements
to
say
as
judge
learned
hand
did
in
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
--
second
court
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
otten
against
the
b&o
railroad
company
cited
at
page
19
of
our
brief,
that
the
situation
is
total,
quite
a
little
different.
certainly,
discrimination
is
not
involved.
it's
merely
a
question
--
it
doesn't
become
discriminatory
because
some
people
are
willing
to
join
unions
and
others
are
not
--
same
conditions
apply
to
all.
and
they
are
agreements
which
this
court
has
recognized
as
among
the
oldest
techniques
of
collective
bargaining
rather
than
instruments
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
i
had
assumed
that
you
would
hear
the
assistant
attorney
general
from
nebraska
first
but
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
well,
that
--
that
was
the
order
i
had
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
assumed.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
think
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
left,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
have
only
a
few
very
brief
comments
to
make
directed
entirely
to
a
matter
of
clarification
as
to
what
has
been
said
regarding
my
position
on
the
so-called
question
of
governmental
action.
if
you
examine
my
brief,
you
will
find
the
--
that
term
not
used
anywhere
because,
i
think,
in
reference
to
this
sort
of
context,
it
is
ambiguous
and
confusing.
obviously,
i
have
never
taken
the
position
and
would
not
be
so
absurd
as
to
take
the
position
that
the
enactment
of
section
211
to
the
railway
labor
act
by
congress
or
the
enactment
of
any
other
part
of
the
railway
labor
act
by
congress
was
not
governmental
action.
the
problem
here
is,
what
does
the
governmental
action
consist
of
and
it
consists
entirely
of
the
enactment
of
that
section
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
to
when
to
strike
the
significance
of
that,
all
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
here
by
the
appellees
concerning
the
depravation
of
particular
rights
such
as
rights
to
work,
rights
of
freedom
to
--
to
associate,
all
arise
out
of
situations
where
the
legislative
authority,
either
state
or
federal,
has
its
self
proscribe
the
right
and
said,
“you
shall
not
work
unless
you
shall
--
you
could
form
the
certain
condition.”
so,
you
shall
not
associate
unless
you
conformed
a
certain
condition.
now,
the
relevance
of
all
those
cases
depends
upon
the
governmental
action
here,
namely,
the
enactment
of
permissive
authority
to
make
contracts
as
being
the
equivalent
of
prescribing
the
terms
of
the
contract.
and
my
point
is
simply
that
does
not
follow
anymore
than
you
test
the
validity
of
negotiated
wage
rights
under
the
railway
labor
act
in
the
same
way
that
you
would
test
the
validity
of
prescribed
wage
rights
set
forth
in
a
congressional
statute.
and
they're
entirely
different
things
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
--
arise
entirely
different
questions.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
that's
right
and
i
--
that's
why
i
mentioned
steele
in
my
--
in
my
original
discussion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
do
not
claim
that
there
are
no
constitutional
limitations
on
the
kinds
of
agreements
that
congress
might
permit
to
be
made
under
the
railway
labor
act.
steele
indicates
the
contrary
very
definitely
even
though
it
was
decided
--
decided
on
a
statutory
ground.
but
here,
we
have
nothing
at
all
similar
to
what
was
involved
in
steele.
we
have
on
the
contrary
the
type
of
agreement
that
has
been
recognized
for
generations
as
a
legitimate
objective
of
collective
bargaining
and
for
congress
to
commit
that
kind
of
an
agreement,
raises
no
questions
comparable
to
those
that
were
raised
in
steele.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
section
4
of
the
agreement?
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
would
say
it
has
to
do
one
further
thing,
mr.
justice
black,
which
may
not
be
of
any
practical
significant
but
which
i
think
is
essential
to
giving
meaning
to
the
word
"become
a
member
and
maintain
membership."
that
is
to
say,
he
has
to
be
consensually
willing
to
join
with
his
fellows
in
an
association.
now,
what
that
means
is
a
practical
matter,
i
frankly
came
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
definitely
not
raised
in
here,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
will
say
this
that
clearly
under
section
4,
if
the
union
or
attainment
of
membership
in
the
union
involves
any
conditions
that
are
objectionable
to
him.
let's
take
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
illustration
of
the
flag
salute.
he
is
certainly
under
section
4
perfectly
free
to
say,
“i
will
not
salute
the
flag
and
if
you
don't
want
me
in
as
a
member
when
i
don't
agree
to
salute
the
flag,
then
you'll
have
to
turn
me
down.”
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
he
was
even
relieved
of
the
act
of
joining.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
he
didn't
have
to
subscribe
for
anything
he
was
--
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
i'd
--
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
don't
think
those
--
those
questions
are
raised
at
all.
i
think,
first,
you
would
have
to
have
a
specific
instance
in
which
the
effort
has
been
made
to
apply
to
some
individual
some
condition
that
he
finds
offensive
to
his
conscience.
mr.
lester
p.
schoene
not
to
my
knowledge,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
of
course,
as
you
undoubtedly
know,
the
--
under
the
federal
corrupt
practices
legislation,
there
are
severe
limitations
on
the
extent
to
which
union
funds
can
be
used
for
political
purposes.
but
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
such
limitations
in
any
of
the
constitutions
or
contract
to
the
organizations
here.
