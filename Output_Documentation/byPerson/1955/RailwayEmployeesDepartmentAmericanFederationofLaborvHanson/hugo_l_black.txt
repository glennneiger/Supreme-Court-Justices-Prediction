how
does
it
go
--
how
that
these
projects
raised
in
the
questions
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
have
these
projects
raised
any
question
in
a
challenge
for
that?
why
or
why
because
they
have
a
right
to
--
how
does
that
raised
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
charge
yet
because
they've
been
using
the
funds
to
try
to
persuade
him
or
somebody
else
to
provide
to
recall
of
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
challenged
here,
the
payment
of
any
particular
expenditure
of
any
particular
views
or
any
particular
purpose
that
will
opposing
on
them
or
requiring
him
to
do
something
they
don't
want
done?
justice

what
(voice

justice
hugo

i
presume
it's
not
--
won't
be
adjudicated
in
this
case,
does
it?
how
could
it
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
the
--
the
problem
that
i
have
of
--
of
that
--
a
number
of
the
other
discussions.
how
are
they
raised
here?
i
assume,
it
may
be
possible
that
there
are
many
things
that
had
been
suggested,
what
challenges
could
be
raised
if
something
was
done
to
a
union
member
or
maybe
he
could
raise
a
challenge
to
the
expenditure
of
fund.
but
how
do
we
get
to
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
of
that
section
4
of
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
9
of
the
record.
i
understood
you
to
say
something
about
it
at
first.
do
you
construe
that
its
meaning,
that
the
man
who
wants
the
job
can
get
it,
provided
he
apply
it
with
section
4
to
this
limited
extent,
he
has
to
do
nothing
but
pay
periodic
views,
initiation
fees
and
assessment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
it
mean
that
--
that
they'd
given
a
number
of
illustrations.
suppose
your
contract
required
him
to
do
this
and
he
had
to
become
a
member,
he
had
to
be
a
participant
even
though
that
union
was
supporting
a
party,
political
party
to
which
he
did
not
agree.
does
this
relieve
him
of
being
compelled
to
subscribe
to
such
an
association
as
that
or
if
you
don't
want
to
say
whether
it
does
or
not,
is
that
question
raised
here
in
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
what
was
done
by
the
union
in
the
otten
case
as
i
read
it,
they
agreed
that
all
he
had
to
do
is
to
pay
his
dues
and
initiation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
have
to
formally
subscribe
to
any
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
i
have
in
my
mind
is
the
question
i
ask
you
observe.
i
do
not
yet
see
how
this
case
raises
any
of
those
questions
of
where
they
are
imposition
in
this
particular
challenge.
