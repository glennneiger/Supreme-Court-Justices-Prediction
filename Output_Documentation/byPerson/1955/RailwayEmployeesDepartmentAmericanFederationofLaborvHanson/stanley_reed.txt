justice
stanley
reed
well,
doesn't
the
statute
itself
have
some
reference
to
the
free
--
free
writing
argument?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
no,
but
on
the
statute
itself.
justice
stanley
reed
no.
i'm
--
i'm
thinking
about
the
proviso
that's
in
the
section
of
(inaudible)
the
railway
labor
act.
so
that
i'm
referring
to
what
you
were
discussing
a
few
moments
ago
about
the
necessity
of
them
supporting
various
things
if
in
the
case
amendment.
and
then
all
--
all
the
things
they
have
to
do
is
to
pay
the
dues?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
but
--
and
when
--
when
you
join
the
only
requirement
is
that
you
pay
dues
for
various
things.
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
this
railway
labor
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
this
respect?
justice
stanley
reed
over
the
action
--
permissive
act.
justice
stanley
reed
both
--
both
the
--
both
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
(inaudible)
and
the
railway
labor
act
are
merely
permissive.
justice
stanley
reed
so
far
as
federal
government
is
concerned.
justice
stanley
reed
both
of
these
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
they
have
the
same
protection
against
the
national
labor
relations
act,
do
they
not,
send
constitution
protection
that
you
heard?
justice
stanley
reed
i
think
you've
answered
the
question
that
i've
asked,
mr.
smith.
thank
you.
