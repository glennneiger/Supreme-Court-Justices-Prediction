mr.
edson
smith
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
not
given
the
court
a
very
complete
picture
of
the
reasons
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
for
affirming
the
injunction
in
this
case
against
the
carrying
into
effect
of
this
union
shop
contract.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
held
that
section
2,
eleventh
of
the
1951
amendment
of
the
railway
labor
act,
which
affirmatively
authorizes
and
attempts
to
legalize
were
otherwise
illegal
union
shop
contracts
in
the
railway
industry
is
unconstitutional
because
it
deprives
employees
in
the
railway
industry
of
their
freedom
of
association,
their
right
to
work
and
their
money
in
the
form
of
union
initiation
fees,
dues
and
assessments
which
it
empowers
the
unions
to
collect
in
any
amount
without
restriction
as
to
amount
and
in
for
any
purposes,
they
can
spend
the
money
for
anything
they
want
to.
the
--
the
court
held
that
if
the
union
shop
amendment
section
2,
eleventh
had
been
narrowly
drawn
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
objective
statute,
which
clearly
was
the
elimination
of
free
writing.
if
it
were
narrowly
drawn
for
that
purpose,
it
might
be
constitutional,
but
the
court
found
that
--
that
isn't
the
case
before
it,
that's
not
the
case
to
decide.
the
court
found
that
this
statute
went
far
beyond
the
necessities
of
the
case
and
impaired,
infringed,
deprived
these
people
of
their
constitutional
rights
as
i
have
mentioned.
now,
in
order
to
make
the
case
clear,
i
think
it's
necessary
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
get
some
of
the
facts
and
determine
how
the
statute
actually
applies
and
how
it
affects
these
people.
and
i'm
going
to
attempt
to
do
that
to
a
limited
extent.
i
have
only
half
an
hour
in
a
case
which
involves
the
constitutional
rights
of
some
300,000
people.
i'm
going
to
go
into
that
hurriedly
and
come
back
to
the
only
issue
which
counsel
for
appellant
urge.
they,
in
their
brief
and
substantially
in
oral
argument
concede
that
this
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
imposed
requirement
of
union
membership.
the
statute
in
and
of
itself
did.
their
argument
simmers
down
to
a
contention
that
because
the
statute
authorizes
and
legalizes
the
action
of
the
unions
in
imposing
union
--
union
shop
contracts
on
railroads
and
requiring
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment.
and
the
unions
have
done
the
actual
requiring
that
this
two-step
operation
is
constitutional
where
a
one
step
operation
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
i'll
come
to
that
after
a
little
further
background.
now,
what
are
in
general
hurriedly
here,
the
rules
with
regard
to
due
process
because
we're
talking
about
the
application
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
there
are
three
rules,
sometimes
applied,
one
in
the
rule
of
rational
basis
which
the
court
has
sometimes
applied
to
ordinary
commercial
transactions.
now,
we
say
that
there's
no
rational
basis
for
this
statute
but
we
further
say
that
it's
not
an
ordinary
commercial
transaction
that's
involved
in
the
rights
of
these
people.
a
second
rule
sometimes
applied
is
that
the
reasonableness,
it's
setout
rather
fully
in
the
case
of
nebbia
versus
new
york
and
the
statute
must
not
be
unreasonable,
arbitrary,
or
capricious.
it
must
not
go
beyond
the
necessities
of
the
case.
and
this
court
has
said,
it
results
that
in
the
--
the
regulation
is
valid
for
one
sort
of
business
or
in
given
circumstances
may
be
invalid
for
another
sort
or
for
the
same
business
under
other
circumstances
because
the
reasonableness
of
each
regulation
depends
upon
the
relevant
facts.
i
don't
--
in
defining
reasonableness,
this
court
has
used
the
expression
that
it's
unreasonable
if
it
goes
beyond
the
necessities
of
the
case.
now,
that
isn't
the
rule
that
we
really
think
is
applicable
in
this
kind
of
a
case
because
the
rights
involved
here,
freedom
of
association,
as
i
shall
attempt
briefly
to
review
for
the
court
is
right
derived
from
the
first
amendment.
the
right
to
work
has
been
said
to
be
one
of
the
most
precious
rights
that
the
people
have
and
those
rights
stand
on
a
higher
plane.
the
real
and
the
--
the
clear
and
present
--
present
danger
rule
is
the
one
which
we
think
is
the
applicable
rule
here.
and
under
that
rule
of
course,
the
presumption,
if
there
would
be
any,
in
a
statute
of
this
kind
which
is
rushed
through
the
house
of
representatives
in
one
hours
time
on
new
years
day
without
any
--
with
only
seven
minutes
allowed
to
explain
its
provisions.
if
there
are
any
presumption
of
its
validity
otherwise,
that
presumption
is
dissipated
in
a
case
in
which
the
court
is
willing
to
apply
the
real
and
present
danger
rule.
in
other
--
actually,
the
presumption
is
against
its
validity.
now,
another
subsidiary
of
that
rule
is
that
statutes
restrictive
of
or
purporting
to
place
limits
to
freedoms
of
this
category
must
be
narrowly
drawn
to
meet
the
precise
evil
the
legislatures
seeks
to
curve.
now,
what
was
that
supposed
evil.
it
was
simply
the
so-called
evil
of
free
writing.
now,
if
you
would
turn
to
some
of
the
statements
in
the
record
by
george
harrison,
who
was
the
spokesman
for
the
railway
exec
labor
executives
association,
which
was
the
sponsor
of
this
bill
before
congress,
he
made
it
quite
clear
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
bill.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
found
and
said
it
is
apparent
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
get
rid
of
free
writers.
the
house
committee
so
reported
the
bill
to
the
house.
and
mr.
harrison's
testimony,
he
says,
“if
we
have
to
bargain
for
these
people,
nonunion
as
well
as
union,
they
ought
to
have
to
pay
the
bill
and
therefore,
ought
to
become
members
of
the
bargaining
organization.
and
then
you
talk
about
union
membership
in
payment
of
dues
and
so
forth
being
like
the
chicken
and
the
egg,
didn't
know
which
came
first,
but
they
had
to
go
together,
and
so
they
should
become
members.
and
you
went
on
to
say
the
only
thing,
we
are
seeking
is
that
those
men
whom
we
will
let
into
the
union
should
be
required
to
support
the
union.
he
didn't
claim
that
this
union
shop
amendment
would
help
collective
bargaining
in
any
respect,
what
he
said
in
that
was
this.
he
was
asked
if
it
would
strengthen
industry-wide
bargaining
in
the
railway
industry
and
he
said,
“no,
i
do
not
think
it
would
affect
the
power
of
bargaining
one
way
or
the
other.
if
i
get
a
majority
of
the
employees,
devote
from
my
union
as
the
bargaining
agent,
i
have
got
as
much
economic
power
at
that
stage
of
the
development
as
i
will
ever
have.
the
man
that
is
going
to
skeg,
he
will
skeg
whether
he
is
in
or
out
of
the
union.
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
now,
that
--
that's
the
purpose
how
far
beyond
that
objective
did
congress
go
in
section
211.
well,
let's
talk
briefly
about
freedom
of
association.
this
court
has
said
that
the
right
of
people
to
join
together
in
a
labor
union,
right
of
employees
to
sell
organization
as
a
fundamental
right.
it's
a
right
not
created
by
statute.
some
of
these
cases
cited
on
page
59
of
my
brief.
it
was
recognized
by
this
court
as
such
in
its
decisions
long
before
it
was
given
protection
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
other
words,
it's
a
fundamental
right,
which
is
sometimes
protected
by
statute
but
regardless
of
statute,
it's
a
fundamental
right.
now,
freedom
of
association
has
been
recognized
in
other
cases
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
the
case
of
wieman
versus
updegraff.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
"by
limiting
the
power
of
the
states
to
interfere
with
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
inquiry
and
freedom
of
association,
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
all
persons,
no
matter
what
their
calling."
it
happened
in
that
case,
it
was
the
teachers
in
the
university
of
oklahoma
that
were
involved.
and
this
court
saved
those
teachers
from
being
deprived
of
their
right
to
work
because
of
the
exercise
of
their
freedom
of
association.
freedom
of
association
has
two
sides,
of
course,
its
freedom
to
join
in
an
association
and
its
freedom
not
to
join
because
if
there
is
only
freedom
to
join,
it
isn't
freedom
at
all,
there's
no
choice,
it's
simply
compulsion.
and
this
court
demonstrated
that
in
the
case
of
first
amendment
freedoms,
in
the
case
of
west
virginia
board
of
education
versus
barnette,
the
flag
salute
case
where
the
court
said,
"to
sustain
the
compulsory
flag
salute,
we
are
required
to
say
that
the
bill
of
rights
which
guards
the
individual's
right
to
speak
his
own
mind
left
it
open
to
public
authorities
to
compel
him
to
utter
what
is
not
in
his
mind."
the
united
nations
universal
declaration
of
human's
right
--
rights
has
recognized
this.
first,
recognizes
the
freedom
of
peaceful
assembly
and
association
and
goes
on
to
say
no
one
maybe
compelled
to
belong
to
an
association.
and
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
maine
has
said,
"freedom
to
associate
of
necessity
means
as
well,
freedom
not
to
associate."
now,
this
statute
affirmatively
authorizes
union
shop
contracts
compelling
these
people
to
become
members
of
an
association,
a
labor
union
that
have
to
join."
that
was
made
clear
by
the
legislative
history.
the
only
case
on
the
subject
was
an
arbitration
case
in
which
a
railway
employee
under
collective
bargaining
contract
of
the
clerk's
union
said,
“i
won't
to
join
but
i
will
pay
my
dues,
fees,
and
assessments”,
and
the
union
demanded
that
she
be
fired
and
the
arbitrator
said
she
had
to
be
fired
because
she
wouldn't
join
the
union.
mr.
edson
smith
she
must
file
an
application
for
membership
and
demonstrate
her
willingness
to
say
that
she
is
a
member.
now,
the
union
--
mr.
edson
smith
well,
i
don't
think
so
myself
but
i
noticed
that
in
the
response
that
the
unions
have
filed
in
the
case
now
pending
in
this
court
of
wicks
and
jensen,
number
808,
which
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
they
say,
"under
usual
circumstances,
the
terms
of
a
union
shop
agreement
require
employees
to
join
the
union
and
execute
the
oath
of
membership."
mr.
edson
smith
yes,
we
do.
mr.
edson
smith
we're
automatically
members,
i
believe.
mr.
edson
smith
it's
not
a
collective
bargaining
agency.
mr.
edson
smith
no,
your
honor,
it's
an
entirely
different
kind
of
an
organization
and
the
purpose
--
mr.
edson
smith
what?
mr.
edson
smith
the
purpose
of
the
integrated
bar
is
to
protect
the
public
and
our
integrated
bar,
it
doesn't
have
authority
to
deprive
anybody
of
their
--
their
work
if
there's
any
question
of
the
proper
conduct
of
the
lawyer.
it
eventually
goes
to
the
supreme
court
of
our
--
mr.
edson
smith
it's
strictly
--
mr.
edson
smith
it
is
also
strictly
regulated
by
statute.
now,
let
me
point
out
a
little
difference
by
--
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
the
machinist
constitution
in
the
record
at
page
103.
you'll
find
there
a
platform.
now,
i'd
like
to
ask
the
members
of
this
court
how
you
would
feel
if
you
were
required
as
a
condition
of
your
employment
to
join
an
organization
with
the
platform
which
says,
"we
pledge
ourselves
to
labor
unitedly
on
behalf
of
the
principles
here
and
set
forth
and
were
among
those
principles
is
that
all
members
of
this
court
should
be
elected
by
popular
vote."
a
man
has
to
join
that
organization
if
he's
going
to
work
as
a
machinist
in
the
railway
industry
now.
he
has
to
become
a
party
to
such
a
platform
and
you'll
find
that
in
there.
he
also
--
it
also
in
that
platform,
you'll
find
the
provision
that
if
the
supreme
court
assumes
to
decide
any
law
of
congress
unconstitutional,
congress
by
repassing
the
law
can
nullify
the
action
of
the
court.
a
machinist
has
to
--
has
to
join
this
organization
of
that
platform
in
order
to
work
in
the
railroad.
mr.
edson
smith
there's
no
fuss
about
in
nebraska.
mr.
edson
smith
well
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
two
organizations
labor
union
is
an
integrated
bar
are
comparable.
i
think
that
the
labor
--
the
integrated
bar,
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
hold
up
the
standards
of
the
bar.
we
don't
set
any
minimum
fee
schedules
or
anything
like
that
or
eliminate
competition.
mr.
edson
smith
no,
congress
have
--
mr.
edson
smith
no,
there's
no
--
there's
no
indication
whatsoever
that
congress
thought
that
because
if
you
will
read
the
--
the
record,
you
find
that
the
advocates
of
this
union
shop
statute
based
their--
advocacies
of
it
solely
on
the
free
writer
argument.
mr.
edson
smith
the
--
the
report
of
congress,
report
of
the
house
committee
to
the
house
recommending
it
bases
it
on
the
free
writer
argument.
mr.
edson
smith
no
the
statute
itself.
this
--
this
section
--
this
amendment,
statute
has
nothing
in
it
at
all
by
way
of
findings
as
to
reasons,
the
title
doesn't
indicate
what
the
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
statute
was.
there's
nothing
in
the
body
of
it.
actually,
there's
nothing
in
it
to
connect
it
in
anyway
with
the
commerce
power.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
indications
from
its
operation
are
that
it
wasn't
as
neither
designed
nor
has
it
resulted
in
any
good
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
they
have
to
pay
the
dues
but
they
have
to
join,
and
--
mr.
edson
smith
well,
alright,
i
haven't
got
too
much
time,
let's
go
--
let's
take
a
look
and
see
what
they
spend
the
dues
for.
in
the
--
one
of
the
letters
which
didn't
get
before
congress
because
the
congressman
had
no
time
to
put
it
in
but
he
put
it
in
the
record
by
extending
his
remarks,
was
a
letter
from
railway
telegrapher.
he
said
he
quit
the
unions
because
he
found
that
most
of
his
dues
of
$28
a
year
were
being
spent
by
the
union
to
oppose
such
man
as
the
honorable
robert
a.
taft,
and
he
didn't
like
that.
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prevents
the
union
from
spending
the
money
that
way.
i
think
most
of
the
members
of
this
court
are
familiar
with
the
practice
of
the
railway
labor
unions
of
issuing
special
editions
of
their
newspaper
labor.
i
remember
well
when
my
father
was
managing
the
campaign
of
the
united
states
senators
some
years
ago,
how
happy
he
was
when
the
railway
labor
unions
came
in
with
a
big
edition
and
blanketed
the
state,
sending
labor
to
every
voter
in
the
state.
he
said,
“well
our
candidate's
in.”
that's
one
of
the
way
--
the
ways
they
spend
the
money.
you'll
find
that
right
in
the
appendix
to
your
decision
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
cio.
now,
to
go
to
an
extreme,
i
have
put
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief,
an
excerpt
from
a
report
--
mr.
edson
smith
calling
the
--
the
court's
attention
to
the
ways
that
the
union
spends
the
money
that
it
collects
under
compulsory
union
membership
contracts
from
unwilling
members
and
i
was
saying
that
i
had
printed
in
the
appendix
at
the
back
of
my
brief,
an
excerpt
from
a
senatorial
committee
report
showing
that
the
cio
in
michigan
that
spent
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
of
union
dues
money
to
help
elect
democrats
to
public
office
in
that
state.
the
investigation,
by
a
number
of
the
universities,
showed
about
40%
of
these
union
members
were
republicans
whose
dues
money
was
going
to
elect
candidates
they
personally
upholds.
thomas
jefferson
wrote
a
number
of
things
among
them,
he
said
this,
"to
compel
a
man
to
furnish
contributions
of
money
for
the
propagation
of
opinions
which
he
disbelieves
is
sinful
and
tyrannical."
in
section
211,
it
qualifies
as
just
that.
now,
certainly,
congress
couldn't
impose
a
tax
and
turn
the
tax
money
over
to
one
political
party
but
it
can
do
it
by
--
composed
by
imposing
by
section
211,
compulsory
union
membership.
congress
can't
impose
a
tax
over
religious
purposes.
this
court
is
so
held
on
several
occasions
but
unions
can
take
their
money
and
donate
it
to
religious
institutions
and
do,
were
recently
notice
in
the
newspaper
an
article
that
the
teamsters
had
given
$9000
to
a
catholic
high
school
in
tacoma
washington.
if
it
were
a
voluntary
organization,
fine.
the
protestants
have
done
better.
the
cio,
philip
murray
fund,
which
is
made
up
from
donations
from
cio
unions
as
well
as
some
individual
contributions,
recently
donated
$200,000
to
the
national
counsel
of
churches.
and
other
unions
have
made
donations,
the
largest
one
recently
so
made
by
the
ladies'
garment
workers'
of
$1
million
to
build
a
hospital
in
beersheba,
israel.
that
union,
it
said
the
new
--
the
article
in
time
which
i
have
quoted
in
the
appendix
in
the
brief
also
said
it
donated
to
various
or
worthy
projects,
i
would
say,
$25
million.
now,
this
money
is
being
taken
from
people
on
the
theory
that
there
are
the
free
writers
unless
they
give
them
--
turn
their
money
over
to
the
union
for
these
purposes.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
have
time
to
talk
much
about
the
right
to
work
or
a
certain
contractual
rights
like
seniority
that
are
involved
here,
but
i
--
i
do
want
to
mention
one
other
thing
that
the
union
collects
money
for
in
the
form
of
dues
and
fees
and
assessments
and
that
its
life
insurance
programs.
one
of
them
requires
$1.30
per
month
as
union
dues
which
goes
to
life
insurance.
and
this
life
insurance
program
collected
out
of
union
dues,
it
gives
these
unions
a
little
better
disciplinary
power
than
the
other
ways
would
have
because
at
any
time,
they
want
to
exercise
discipline
over
these
involuntary
members.
they
can
suspend
them
and
thereby,
the
--
by
suspending
them
they
cancel
their
insurance
rights
or
if
a
man
who
has
been
a
union
member
for
many,
many
years
and
this
buildup
a
substantial
value
in
his
insurance
program
out
of
union
dues
should
refuse
to
go
out
on
strike
on
some
occasion
taken,
expel
him
or
suspend
him
and
thereby
cancel
his
insurance.
so
that
his
membership
and
his
requirement
of
paying
dues
involves
--
it
gives
the
union
considerable
disciplinary
power
over
the
involuntary
member.
now,
the
right
to
work,
freedom
of
association,
as
i've
said
our
--
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
occasions,
are
fundamental
rights.
some
of
these
fundamental
rights
which
cannot
be
taken
away
because
of
protection
by
the
constitution
cannot
be
taken
away
by
the
government
either
state
or
--
or
local
may
be
taken
away
by
private
action
unless
they
are
protected
by
state
law.
we
have
state
laws
that
protect
the
individual
from
private
aggression,
state
homicide
laws.
a
man's
life
is
protected
from
the
federal
government
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
from
state
government
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
there's
no
constitutional
protection
from
a
--
other
individual
private
action
taking
his
life.
now,
i
want
to
put
in
extreme
illustration
here
and
i'm
getting
the
governmental
action
now,
which
is
the
only
subject
that
mr.
schoene
argued.
suppose,
and
i'll
say
it
can't
happen
here,
i'm
just
putting
it
for
a
drastic
illustration,
that
congress
had
said
that
any
man
who
would
refuse
to
join
the
--
the
union
may
make
a
contract
requiring
that
all
people
in
the
craft
or
class
joined
the
union
and
if
they
refused
to
join,
they
may
be
executed
by
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
railroad.
now,
mr.
schoene
would
say,
"that's
all
right.
that's
constitutional.
it's
perfect.
it's
private
action.
it's
purely
permissive
of
the
statute
that
congress
didn't
make
it
mandatory.
the
man's
life
is
not
being
taken
away
by
governmental
action,
it's
purely
private
action.
so,
no
constitutional
right
is
violated."
but
it's
--
he
would
say,
"the
congress
has
preempted
the
field
of
regulation
of
the
protection
of
life
by
homicide
laws
in
this
particular
connection.
and
therefore,
state
law
with
regard
to
homicide
is
set
aside
but
in
setting
aside
the
state
law
is
not
governmental
action,"
he
says.
you
could
do
the
same
thing
as
reference
to
kidnapping
laws.
let's
say
that
the
congress
authorized,
permitted
the
unions
to
imprison
anyone
who
refused
to
join.would
his
liberty
be
deprived
to
taken
away
by
governmental
action?
mr.
schoene
would
say,
no,
duly
private.
the
statute
is
merely
permissive.
and
under
his
theory,
if
congress
wanted
to,
congress
could
say
that
not
withstanding
state,
fepc
laws,
congress
may
enact
the
statute
providing
that
railroads
for
any
employer
and
unions
may
validly
contract
that
no
negro
be
employed,
not
withstanding
the
state
law.
it
merely
preempts
the
field
the
negro's
rights
are
not
being
impaired.
there's
no
governmental
action.
it's
--
it's
purely
private
action.
or
if
the
congress
wanted
to
turn
the
other
way
and
say,
we
will
say
that
yellow-dog
contracts
may
be
made
legally
either
by
the
union
members,
written
association
will
be
taken
away
but
we're
not
--
we're
not
saying
that
employers
and
employees
must
execute
such
contracts.
we're
not
making
it
mandatory,
it's
purely
permissive.
and
therefore,
no
governmental
action
were
merely
preempting
the
field.
well,
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
are
so
numerous
and
so
clear
on
this
subject
of
governmental
action
that
i
don't
--
i
know
i
don't
have
time
to
review
them,
if
in
the
few
moments
that
i
have
left
i
would
like
say
this
though
with
regard
to
section
211.
it
has
two
aspects.
one,
i've
called
the
passive
permission
aspect
and
that
it's
a
mere
repeal
of
the
former
prohibitions
of
the
railway
labor
act,
former
prohibition
of
the
union
shop
contracts.
in
that
respect,
it's
similar
to
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
act.
those
acts
did
not
authorize
in
any
affirmative
sense,
union
shop
contracts.
they
merely
contained
the
proviso
making
it
clear
that
they
did
not
prohibit
them.
in
that
sense,
they
were
to
pass
a
permission
and
in
that
connection
because
of
the
citation
by
mr.
schoene
of
the
colgate
case
and
some
others.
i
will
say
that
those
cases
did
not
involve
any
constitutional
question
because
none
was
raised.
it
was
merely
an
absence
of
prohibition
that
was
involved
there,
merely
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
but
here,
in
section
211,
for
the
first
time,
congress
has
reached
out
and
affirmatively
authorized
the
unions
to
impose
union
shop
contracts
on
an
entire
industry,
notwithstanding
state
law
to
the
contrary.
that's
an
entirely
new
--
new
situation
and
--
mr.
edson
smith
oh,
very
definitely,
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
is,
of
course,
the
wagner
act
has
amended
by
the
taft-hartley
act
has
merely
a
proviso
there
in
--
section
8
(a)
(3)
which
makes
it
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
prohibit
union
shop
contracts
of
the
sort
that
are
there
described
in
--
except
for
that
proviso,
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
makes
it
illegal
for
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
an
employee
by
reason
of
union
or
nonunion
membership,
would
prohibit
union
shop
contracts.
so,
it
is
necessary
to
put
in
the
proviso
to
make
it
clear
that
they
were
not
being
prohibited.
but
here,
in
the
railway
labor
act,
for
the
first
time
in
history,
congress
has
reached
out
and
said
we
affirmatively
authorized
the
languages.
they
shall
be
permitted,
notwithstanding
state
law
to
the
contrary.
and
so,
in
two
cases,
one
of
which
is
now
before
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari,
the
weeks
and
jensen
cases
decided
by
the
federal
courts
out
in
california,
the
other,
the
otten
case
decided
by
the
second
circuit.
those
cases
coming
up
from
states
where
the
--
there
were
no
right
to
work
acts
where
under
the
common
law
in
the
state
union
closed
shop
contracts
were
considered
permissible.
those
courts
held
that
only
the
--
what
i've
called
the
passive
permission
aspect
of
section
211
who
was
involved,
it
was
a
mere
repeal
pro
tanto
of
the
former
prohibition
and
of
--
mr.
edson
smith
yes.
the
--
it
was
merely
permissive
and
they
did
--
mr.
edson
smith
well,
not
--
of
course,
the
railway
they're
--
they're
merely
permissive
in
little
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
edson
smith
so
far
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
what
you
--
what
you
have
in
mind
by
using
merely
permissive.
i
have
--
i
have
been
using
permissive
and
passive
permission
as
distinguished
from
affirmative
authorization.
now,
they're
--
the
--
mr.
edson
smith
--
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
affirmatively
authorized
union
shop
contracts.
it
does
permit
them
in
the
sense
of
not
prohibiting
them
but
the
railway
labor
act
goes
farther.
it
affirmatively
authorizes
them
and
says
they
shall
be
permitted,
not
withstanding
state
law
to
the
contrary.
now,
that
is
a
--
is
a
best
distinction
in
the
absence
of
that
affirmative
language.
in
the
railway
labor
act,
these
plaintiffs,
my
clients
in
this
case
would
still
have
their
rights.
they
wouldn't
have
to
join
the
union
because
the
nebraska
law
protects
them
from
being
compelled
to
join
the
union.
but
in
order
--
and
the
--
mr.
edson
smith
that
--
that
is
another
question.
now,
if
--
it
depends
on
what
we're
looking
at
with
regard
to
governmental
action
here.
i
am
saying
that
in
this
case,
we
can
rely
solely
on
the
affirmative
authorization
in
the
--
in
section
211
itself
as
providing
the
governmental
action
necessary
to
entitle
my
clients
to
invoke
the
protection
of
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
in
other
words,
where
congress
says
union
shop
contract
shall
be
permitted
and
thereby,
the
statute
becomes
an
essential
ingredient
--
ingredient
in
the
process
of
taking
away
my
clients
rights,
then
that
is
governmental
action
in
and
of
itself.
now,
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
nation
labor
relations
act
and
of
course
a
union
shop
contracts
in
industry
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
are
not
lawful
in
nebraska.
they're
not
lawful
in
any
of
the
18
states
having
right
to
work
at.
but,
the
railway
labor
act,
because
it
went
farther
and
affirmatively
authorized
these
contracts
and
attempted
to
sweep
away
the
state
law,
and
thereby,
preempted
the
field
if
it's
a
constitutional
statute,
i
say
that
is
governmental
action.
now,
there's
another
aspect
to
this
thing
which
will
come
before
the
court.
mr.
edson
smith
well,
i
thought
--
mr.
edson
smith
i
thought
i
was,
your
honor.
mr.
edson
smith
i
--
mr.
edson
smith
well,
it's
another
aspect
of
my
answer
to
his
question,
if
the
court
--
mr.
edson
smith
--
please.
i
was
--
i
was
going
to
say
on
this
--
the
question
that
you
asked
about
the
--
wouldn't
the
national
labor
relations
act
beyond
constitutional
in
this
respect
is
one
which
i
think
the
court
may
have
to
reach
some
time.
and
i
think
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
come
rather
close
to
reaching
it
in
the
weeks
and
jensen
cases
which
have
been
filed
here,
in
petition
for
certiorari,
because
there,
instead
of
relying,
as
i
do,
in
this
case
for
the
most
part
on
the
affirmative
authorization
in
section
211,
those
cases
arising
from
california
where
there
is
no
--
where
union
shop
contracts
under
state
law
are
suppose
to
be
illegal,
rely
on
what
is
described
there
as
the
full
--
tenably,
you
might
say,
of
the
statutory
powers
and
privileges
which
are
vested
in
these
unions
by
the
entire
railway
labor
act.
for
instance,
the
railway
labor
act
gives
the
labor
unions
the
right
to
bargain
for
all
of
the
members
of
the
craft
or
class.
