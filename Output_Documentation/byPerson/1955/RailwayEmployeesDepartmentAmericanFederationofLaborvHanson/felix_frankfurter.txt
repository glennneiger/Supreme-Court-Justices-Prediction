and
if
the
party
--
i
take
it
,
the
argument
is
that
if
a
party
exercises
what
we
call
their
liberty
necessarily
the
right
to
go
to
object
to
that
mode
of
exercising
their
liberty,
coerced
it.
justice

that's
the
legal
controversies
upon
(inaudible)
voluntarily
agreeing
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
the
department
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schoene,
the
problem
of
the
so-called
--
so-called
problem
is
the
problem
of
the
so-called
closed
union
entered
to
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
problem
of
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
question
--
is
the
question
reduced
to
one
that's
--
i
put
to
you
a
little
while
ago,
namely
whether
people
can
be
bound
as
to
the
terms
of
resulting
collective
agreements,
although
they
themselves
was
referred
to
be
in
addition
here
on
different
(inaudible)
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
joining
mean?
what
--
what
is
involved
in
joining?
must
she
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
meetings
or
must
she
salute
some
union
class?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
an
integrated
bar
in
nebraska?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
have
to
join?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
construe
it
in
the
ground
of
the
first
amendment,
you
dismiss?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
as
found
in
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
as
found
in
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
automatic
that
somehow
whether
--
i
forgot
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
speaking
of
individual
as
it's
the
adequate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
smith,
if
it
means
nothing
it's
an
integrated
bar,
it's
an
empty
phrase,
what's
all
the
fuss
about
it
in
the
part
of
the
bar
association?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mainly
not
in
nebraska
but
the
moment
you
have
an
integrated
bar,
and
what
it
means
and
why
you
must
have
it,
of
all
the
queries
involving
literature
that
come
my
way
in
the
course
for
the
last
15
years,
that
takes
a
high
rates
or
i
think
it
has
integrated
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
congress
may
have
reported
would
be
important
for
the
public
interest
to
have
responsibility
on
the
part
of
those
who
work
for
railroads
and
that
the
way
to
get
responsibility
is
to
have
this
kind
of
organizations.
that's
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
congress
made
--
didn't
add.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
make
a
little
conflict
in
the
facts
of
question.
suppose
the
union
had
bylaw
or
some
compelling
provision
and
its
scheme
of
government
requiring
every
member
to
salute
the
flag.
suppose
that
some
of
the
union
and
the
condition
that
he
believes
are
the
--
the
whole
witnesses
despite
the
(inaudible)
you
then
say
no,
you
were
asking
me
to
do
something
which
has
essential
to
provision
of
federal
law,
you're
asking
me
to
do
something
that
the
violation
to
pass
these
laws,
therefore,
you're
asking,
meeting
your
power
for
the
violation
of
constitution
of
united
states.
now,
that's
a
very
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
problem
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
have
(inaudible)
where
the
defendant
has
--
has
a
member
of
the
(inaudible)
brothers
at
religious
(inaudible)
against
joining
an
organization,
state
upon
on
which
i
have
not
(inaudible)
and
that
was
that
problem
there,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
again,
that's
the
rule
for
this
court
to
ever
pressure
--
doesn't
involve
political
sanctions.
that's
one
of
the
prices
you
pay.
what
do
you
do
with
that
case?
i
think
he
should
say
that
we
ought
not
to

is
wrong
so
far
as
this
is
wrong.
justice

(voice

spend
try
to
distinguish
it,
but
i
think
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
--
certain
--
certain
rights,
certain
powers
glow
to
the
union
from
the
fact
that
you
all
might
make
in
such
an
agreement,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

claims
that
all
the
government,
entirely,
is

it
gave
you
freedom
to
do

do
what
you
please
because
that
analogy

(inaudible)
justice

mr.
schoene,
before
you
sit
down,
may
ask
you
this.
i
haven't
read
this
contract
but
i
assume
that
is
not
in
this
context.
but
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
any
of
the
effective
agreements,
any
of
the
railroad
union,
there
is
in
the
contract
a
provision
similar,
what
i
believe
in
the
english
legislation
whereby
a
member
of
a
union,
contracting
can
by
appropriate
invitation,
notice,
see
to
it
that
his
contribution
to
his
fees,
his
dues
with
the
union
are
not
used
for
any
political
purpose,
is
there
anything
like
that
in
any
of
our
railroad
or
other
collective
opinion?
