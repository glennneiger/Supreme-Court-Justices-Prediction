mr.
robert
a.
nelson
if
the
court
please.
nebraska
has
vital
interest
in
this
case.
it
is
a
law
which
was
written
into
our
constitution
by
direct
act
of
the
people
and
without
legislative
intervention
that
is
under
attack
here.
consequently,
we
asked
(inaudible)
to
appear
here
in
oral
argue
--
argue
orally
and
greatly
appreciate
the
opportunity
that
you
have
given
us.
there
are
17
other
states
who
have
industry,
constitutional
amendment
or
legislative
enactment,
task
laws
which
are
similar
to
the
nebraska
law
here
involved.
several
of
the
--
these
states
have
written
separate
briefs
as
amicus
curiae
and
some
have
joined
with
us
and
some
have
joined
in
other
briefs
where
mr.
shepperd,
the
attorney
general
of
texas
that's
had
some
joinder
in
his
brief.
i
believe
there
are
total
of
10
states
now
who
appear
here
by
brief
and
i
would
like
to
appeal
that
in
presenting
this
case,
i've
presented
not
only
in
behalf
of
the
state
of
nebraska
but
all
other
states
who
have
similar
laws
and
even
though
states
who
do
not,
have
not
as
yet,
enacted
such
laws
who
may
wish
to
do
so
at
some
future
time
and
may
not
wish
to
be
hampered
if
that
time
should
come.
the
constitutionality
of
our
nebraska
law
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
lincoln
federal
labor
union
versus
northwestern
iron
and
metal
company,
335
u.s.
525.
we
feel
that
the
--
the
duty
that
is
imposed
upon
a
state
here
to
protect,
to
preserve
the
life
and
liberty
of
these
people
and
protect
their
property
is
a
vital
importance
to
us
and
is
a
question
that
is
presented
here.
the
first
thing,
of
course,
that
must
be
determined
is
whether
or
not
there
is
governmental
action
involved.
supreme
court
in
nebraska
held
that
there
was
and
they
--
they
said
that
discharge
of
an
employee
pursuant
to
a
union
shop
agreement
that's
expressly
authorized
by
section
211
would
unconstitutionally
deprive
him
of
his
right
to
work,
a
freedom
of
association
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fifth
amendments.
on
arriving,
its
--
its
conclusion,
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
recognized
that
section
211
is
not
a
mere
repeal
of
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
prohibited
all
forms
of
compulsory
union
is,
but
that
the
union
shop
amendment
does
far
more
than
that.
it
affirmatively
authorizes
the
union
shop
and
strikes
down
all
present
and
prospective
conflicting
federal
and
state
laws.
so,
in
determining
whether
or
not
governmental
action
is
involved,
we
can't
consider
the
--
the
amendment
law
but
we
must
consider
it
in
relation
to
the
entire
railway
labor
act.
it's
because
of
congressional
action
that
the
unions
have
gained
the
power
that
they
have
today
and
have
the
economic
strengths
which
make
it
possible
for
them
to
impose
the
union
shop.
and
because
of
the
power
that
congress
has
given
to
the
labor
unions,
their
actions
are
no
longer
private
but
are
governmental
actions.
now,
that
was
recognized
in
the
steele
case.
mr.
schoene
stated
that
that
is
not
in
authority
here
because
the
--
the
steele
case
involved
racial
discrimination
and
that
is
not
involved
here.
but
we
have
discrimination
merely
upon
a
different
ground,
a
discrimination
against
nonunion
members
against
members
who
do
not
wish
to
join.
so,
we
have
a
government
action.
here,
of
the
highest
degree,
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
on
this
question,
the
amicus
brief
written
here
on
behalf
of
the
ciaf
--
cio
organization,
they
take
the
entirely
of
the
opposite
stand,
page
5
of
their
brief
where
they
came
up
and
emphatically
say
that
we
agree
that
there
is
government
action.
they
go
on
to
say
that
indeed
to
find
governmental
action
in
the
union
shop
amendment
is
not
necessary
to
look
to
its
effect
in
ousting
conflicting
state
laws.
the
amendment
is
part
of
the
general
regulatory
scheme
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
it
has
never
been
doubted
that
that
statute
is
governmental
action
and
that
its
provisions
must
therefore
meet
the
requirements
of
due
process.
now,
we
agree
with
the
brief
written
by
that
organization.
there
--
there
can
be
no
pretense
here
that
it
isn't
the
act
of
congress
that's
being
placed
into
effect.
in
fact,
the
answer
here
of
the
appellant
unions
expressly
states
that
the
agreements
are
lawfully
entered
into,
pursuant
to
the
prohibitions
of
section
211
of
the
railway
labor
act.
in
effect,
of
course,
the
union
shop
--
the
amendment
repeals
certain
federal
laws
including
the
sections
fourth
and
fifth
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
embodied
the
freedom
to
join
or
not
to
join
labor
organization.
so,
congress
here
has
foreclosed
and
prevented
the
states,
their
legislator,
their
executives
and
administrative
officers
from
acting
with
reference
to
our
own
state
laws.
now,
this
is
--
that
is
certainly
a
mandatory
and
affirmative
action.
it's
far
more
than
a
mere
repeal
of
the
federal
law.
congress
doesn't
have
the
power
to
repeal
a
state
law.
they
do,
in
certain
instances,
have
authority
to
supersede
those
laws.
but
certainly,
when
we're
talking
about
the
question
of
whether
or
not
government
action
exists,
when
they
--
congress
attempts
to
supersede
state
laws,
it
is
affirmative
action.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
--
it's
just
fantastic
to
even
suggest
that
government
action
is
not
in
--
involved
in
this
case.
congress
has
given
here
the
unions
the
help
that
they
requested
in
order
to
have
a
compulsory
union
shop
throughout
the
entire
railway
industry.
also,
in
doing
this,
congress
purported
to
act
under
the
commerce
clause
and
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause
is
certainly
government
action
and
affirmative
action.
so,
with
that
issue,
as
appears
to
me,
just
conclusively
decided,
we
--
we
then
have
to
test
this
act
with
reference
to
the
bill
of
rights.
so,
it
--
it
has
been
mentioned
here
but
briefly,
i
just
wish
to
point
this
out
here
that
it's
not
a
mere
matter
here
of
coming
in
and
joining
a
labor
organization
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
bargaining
that's
involved.
but
all
dues,
assessments,
except
fines
and
penalties,
are
required
to
be
paid
by
the
individual
regardless
of
whether
he
desires
to
do
so
or
not.
he's
being
forced
to
join
into
a
fraternal
order,
an
insurance
society
and
a
political
and
economic
movement.
for
example,
the
applications
required
uniformly
provide
that
the
applicant
will
adhere
to
and
abide
by
all
of
the
rules
and
edicts
of
the
order.
one
of
the
provisions,
which
i
think
you
find
universally
through
this
application,
is
that
he
would
not
affiliate
with
any
other
conflicting
order.
in
other
words,
any
other
labor
organization.
there
have
been
--
mr.
smith
has
mentioned
here
political
movements,
religious
movements
and
economic
movements.
now,
what
is
the
non-member
required
to
do?
he
is
required
to
join
and
he
is
required
to
support
these
movements
whether
he
believes
in
them
or
not.
for
example,
the
--
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
international
association
of
machinists,
which
is
in
this
record,
provides
that
no
inferior
federal
judge,
so
set
aside
a
law
of
congress
on
the
ground
that
it's
unconstitutional,
and
that
if
this
court
decides
and
enacted
congress
is
unconstitutional
or
by
interpretation
undertakes
to
assert
a
public
policy
at
variance
with
the
statutory
declaration
of
congress,
which
alone,
under
our
system,
is
authorized
to
determine
the
public
policies
of
government.
the
congress,
thereby
re-passing
that
law
nullify
the
action
of
the
court.
thereafter,
the
law
is
to
remain
enforced
and
in
fact
precisely
the
same
as
though
the
court
had
never
held
it
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
i
didn't
get
your
question.
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
well,
the
--
these
are
merely
illustrations
that
are
in
the
record
showing
the
requirements
of
many
of
the
unions.
they
are
merely
here
to
illustrate,
and
of
course,
are
not
all
inclusive
by
any
means.
but
we
raised
them
here
to
show
that
these
are
certainly
controversial
issues.
they
are
issues
in
which
the
individual
has
different
opinion
but
regardless
of
what
his
thoughts
may
be,
he
is
required
to
pay
his
dues
to
support
the
organization
who's
advocating
these
principles
even
though
there
--
he's
absolutely
opposed
to
it.
that's
what's
required
in
a
compulsory
membership.
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
the
--
this
is
what
i
just
read
there,
that's
found
in
--
in
the
record
and
it's
part
of
the
platform
of
the
appellant
international
association
of
machinists,
here.
and
of
course,
the
--
the
fees,
the
dues
that
are
being
collected
are
being
used
to
promote
this
--
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
no.
that
it's
actually
--
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
--
be
done
in
this
case.
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
black,
because
i
think
this
is
--
this
action
was
brought
before
there
was
an
opportunity
to
even
put
this
contract
into
operation,
at
least,
to
any
extent.
so,
i
--
i
would
doubt
if
that
question
would
be
--
could
be
shown
to
actually
have
it
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
i
--
i
think
it's
here.
it's
in
the
record
here
to
show
that
these
are
some
of
the
programs
and
policies
that
the
labor
unions,
certain
of
them
are
advocating
and
that
compulsory
membership,
therefore,
compels
a
man
to
come
in
and
join
in,
in
support
of
those
movements.
and
certainly
by
so
doing,
you're
taking
away
his
--
his
freedom
of
speech.
it
is
the
--
the
record
discloses.
here,
some
of
the
--
the
constitutions
prohibit
a
members
or
group
of
members
from
discussing
union
policies,
union
officers
or
anything
outside
of
the
union
meetings
himself.
they're
not
permitted
to
do
anything
except
or
inside
the
--
the
close
meetings.
now,
this
is
a
private
--
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
well,
i
think
the
--
the
very
fact
here
that
the
contract
was
entered
into
with
the
union
pacific
railroad
and
these
unions
and
the
--
the
contract
for
compulsory
unionism
then
requires
that
they
join
into
this
union
representing
their
particular
craft.
and
then
that
union,
we
have
here
their
constitution
which
makes
these
requirement,
it
would
seem
to
me,
would
make
that
an
issue
here
that
it
--
it
would
have
to
be
considered
--
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
--
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
yes.
but
here,
at
the
same
time,
we
have
a
contract
now
that
has
been
negotiated
which
requires
the
individual,
either
to
lose
his
job,
or
become
a
member
of
the
union.
a
union,
which
may
be
advocating
the
very
thoughts
and
ideas.
and
while
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
we
don't
have
the
question
that's
in
the
weeks
and
jensen
cases
but
there
you
have
your
--
your
religious
issue.
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
yes.
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
well,
our
--
our
whole
--
mr.
robert
a.
nelson
well,
i
noticed
here
in
the
--
in
the
sandsberry
petitioners
brief,
his
amicus
curiae
on
page
29
--
starting
on
page
29,
they
have
brief
in
number
of
cases
that
we
didn't
go
into
--
into
the
detail
that
they
have
on
this
matter,
but
i
think
some
of
those
that
are
the
cases
that
would
distinguish
the
matter
here,
your
public
utilities
commission
versus
pollak
in
343
u.s.
451.
there,
the
capital
transit
company
of
the
washington
here
had
a
recurring
radio
programs
on
their
--
their
trollies
and
buses
and
some
of
the
riders
complaint
to
the
public
utilities
commission
about
that
and
said
their
freedom
of
privacy
here
was
being
impaired.
and
the
--
the
utilities
commission
then
held
a
hearing
and
said
no.
but
if
this
court's
held
here
that
that
mere
permissive
action
on
the
part
of
the
utilities
commission
was
government
action
so
as
to
raise
the
constitutional
question
there.
and
there
are
numerous
--
those
cases
cited
here
put
your
terry
versus
adams.
i'm
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with
that
case
where
you
reviewed
the
activities
of
the
political
association
in
texas.
now,
he
admittedly,
a
private
organization
that
held
elections
to
select
candidates
for
county
office
in
the
official
democratic
primary.
well,
there
are
negroes
who
were
excluded
from
joining
in
that
organization
and
the
result
was,
that
i
guess
for
50
years
is
a
--
the
opinion
state,
no
one
else
had
ever
been
elected
so
it
was
tantamount
to
election.
there
was
a
case
of
the
state's
failure
to
enact
laws,
to
protect
these
individuals
that
the
court
said
was
government
action
which
raised
this
constitutional
question.
now,
it
is
our
contention
--
it's
a
contention
on
the
state
so
that
in
our
right
to
work
laws,
all
that
we
are
doing
there
is
implemented,
the
basic
liberties
and
fundamental
rights
that
are
guaranteed
to
the
people
against
state
action
by
the
--
the
federal
bill
of
rights.
the
freedom
of
association,
the
right
to
work,
the
taking
of
due
property
without
due
process
of
law.
all
are
rights
that
are
involved
here
and
all
are
being
assured
to
the
individual
through
our
right
to
work
law.
now,
it
is
always
had
been
the
duty
of
the
state
to
protect
its
citizens,
its
life,
liberty
and
pursuit
of
happiness
and
to
protect
them
in
their
property
rights.
that's
what
the
states
are
attempting
to
do.
now,
a
law,
therefore,
that
does
no
more
than
that,
that
does
no
more
than
to
assure
to
the
individual
the
rights
which
have
been
guaranteed
to
him
under
the
constitution,
under
the
bill
of
rights.
how
can
such
an
act
be
struck
down
by
an
act
of
congress?
the
--
these
basic
rights
which
our
court
considered
as
the
--
the
issue
here
which
made
this
act
of
congress
unconstitutional,
i
think
the
--
the
statement
of
judge
wenke
there
can't
--
i
can't
state
it
any
better
than
to
just
read
that
quote
from
him.
we
also
think
the
right
to
work
is
one
of
the
most
precious
liberties
that
man
possesses.
man
has
much
right
to
work
as
he
has
to
live
to
be
free
to
own
property
or
to
join
a
church
of
his
own
choice
for
without
freedom
to
work,
the
others
would
soon
disappear.
it
is
a
fundamental
human
right
which
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
protects
from
improper
infringement
by
the
federal
government,
to
work
for
a
living
in
occupations
available
in
the
community
is
the
very
essence
of
personal
freedom,
and
opportunity
that
it
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
these
amendments
to
make
secure.
liberty
means
more
than
freedom
servitude.
the
constitutional
guarantees
are
assurance
that
the
citizen
will
be
protected
in
the
right
to
use
his
powers
of
mind
and
body
in
any
lawful
calling."
and
they
went
on
to
consider
the
purpose,
the
motive
fact
of
this
act
which
is
admittedly
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
the
free
writer.
and
--
and
there,
they
said,
we
can
find
no
condition
to
have
existed
at
the
time
the
amendment
was
adopted
to
authorize
any
restriction
of
these
rights.
consequently,
we
think
congress
was
without
authority
to
impose
upon
employees
or
railroads
in
nebraska
contrary
to
our
constitution
and
statutory
provisions
the
requirement
that
they
must
become
members
of
a
union
representing
their
craft
or
class
as
a
condition
for
a
continued
employment.
it
improperly
--
improperly
burdens
a
right
to
work
and
infringes
upon
their
freedoms.
this
is
particularly
true
as
to
the
latter
because
it
is
apparent
that
some
of
these
labor
organizations
advocate
political
ideas,
support
political
candidates
and
advance
national
ecomanic
concepts
which
may
or
may
not
be
of
an
employee's
choice.
now,
none
--
none
of
the
--
those
statements
have
been
challenged
here
by
either
the
appellants
or
their
amici.
and
i
think
it's
--
it
can
be
conceded
here
that
the
purpose,
the
whole
--
whole
purpose
of
this
law
was
to
eliminate
the
free
writer.
property
rights
are
guaranteed
by
the
state
right
to
work
law.
contract
rights,
of
course,
are
property
right
and
the
statement
in
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
that
the
very
idea
that
one
man
may
be
compelled
to
hold
his
life
for
the
means
of
living
or
any
material
right
essential
to
the
enjoyment
of
life
at
the
mere
will
of
another,
seems
to
be
intolerable
in
any
country
where
freedom
prevails
as
being
the
very
essence
of
slavery
itself.
now,
we
feel
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
state
to
protect
these
rights.
article
i
section
1
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
nebraska
provides
that
all
persons
are
by
nature
free
and
independent
and
have
certain
inherent
and
unalienable
rights,
among
these
are
light
liberty
and
a
pursuit
of
happiness.
to
secure
these
rights
and
the
protection
of
property,
governments
are
instituted
among
people
to
deriving
their
just
power
from
the
consent
of
the
government.
a
similar
provisions
may
be
found,
i
think
in
the
constitutions
of
all
of
the
other
states.
article
x
of
the
bill
of
rights,
the
federal
constitution
provides
the
powers
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
by
the
constitution
or
prohibited
by
it
to
the
states
i
reserve
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people.
it's
under
this
reserved
power
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
nebraska
and
that
these
other
states
have
initiated
the
laws
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
people.
there
is
nothing
here
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
which
can
possibly
justify
this
congressional
action,
while
under
the
commerce
clause,
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
but
is
not
had
unlimited
power
and
must
be
exercised
within
the
bounds
laid
out
by
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
principally,
the
bill
of
rights.
the
guarantees
of
the
bill
of
rights,
as
stated
in
the
case
of
west
virginia
state
board
of
education
versus
barnette
in
319
u.s.
624,
these
rights
should
only
be
susceptible
to
restriction
to
prevent
grave
and
immediate
danger
to
interest
which
the
government
is
obligated
to
protect.
therefore,
we
sincerely
feel
that
congress
here
debar
exceeded
any
authority
that
they
had
to
--
in
--
in
their
attempt
here
to
strike
down
the
laws
of
the
state.
there's
one
other
point
that
i
--
i
want
to
mention
here,
my
time
is
about
out,
and
that
is
that
we
do
not,
the
illinois,
when
i
say
"we",
i'm
speaking
for
all
of
the
states
who
have
this
right
to
work
laws
that
these
laws
are
anti-union.
but
on
the
contrary,
i
firmly
believe
that
such
laws
are
absolutely
essential
to
the
survival
of
labor
unions
particularly
in
lieu
of
the
power
given
to
them
by
the
laws
of
the
nation.
mr.
justice
brandeis,
of
course
he
was
a
supporter
of
unionism
in
a
letter
to
lincoln
steffens
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
versus
american
sash
and
door
company
case
which
is
a
companion
case
to
the
--
to
the
nebraska
case.
it
was
argued
here
at
the
same
time
in
which
he
stated,
“but
the
american
people
should
not
and
will
not
accept
unionism
if
it
involves
a
closed
shop.
they
will
not
consent
to
the
exchange
of
the
tyranny
of
the
employer
for
the
tyranny
of
the
employees.”
and
later,
on
he
went
out
to
sum
this
up.
it
is
not
true
that
the
success
of
the
labor
union
necessarily
means
perfect
monopoly.
the
union,
in
order
to
obtain
and
preserve
for
its
members
industrial
liberty,
must
be
strong
and
stable.
it
need
not
include
any
member
of
the
trade.
indeed,
it
is
desirable
both
--
for
both
the
employer
and
the
union
that
--
that
it
should
not.
absolute
power
leads
to
excesses
and
to
witnesses,
either
our
character
nor
our
intelligence
can
long
bear
this
grave
among
restricted
power.
now,
we
--
we
believe
that
that
is
a
correct
statement,
that
is
the
attitude
that
people
of
our
states
have
--
have
taken.
they
have
taken
the
position
that
union
members
and
union
leaders
are
no
different
than
in
any
other
individual.
they're
not
incapable
of
--
of
making
errors.
they
have
the
same
weaknesses
and
frailties
in
everyone
else
that
they're
--
they,
as
well
as,
officials
in
government
must
have
some
restriction
and
that
voluntary
unionism
is
the
most
effective
means
of
maintaining
this
democratic
control
over
our
labor
unions
which
have
become
such
a
vital
part
of
our
lives
in
this
nation.
