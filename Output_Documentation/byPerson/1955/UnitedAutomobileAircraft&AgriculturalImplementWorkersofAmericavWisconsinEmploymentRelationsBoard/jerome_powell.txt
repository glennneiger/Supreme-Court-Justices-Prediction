mr.
jerome
powell
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mrs.
lampert
has
already
suggested,
we
feel
quite
strongly
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
section
on
which
the
claim
of
federal
preemption
here
is
based,
demonstrates
quite
clearly
that
congress
expressly
intended
to
preserve
state
remedies
against
the
sort
of
violent
conduct
which
is
revealed
by
this
record.
mr.
jerome
powell
yes,
your
honor,
we
concede
that.
we
concede
that.
mr.
jerome
powell
it
is,
your
honor.
and
we
recognize,
of
course,
the
possibility
that
your
honors
may
not
feel
that
the
legislative
history
is
conclusive
as
to
whether
this
particular
state
power
was
in
fact
intended
by
congress
to
be
preserved
and
that
having
not
found
a
conclusive
answer
to
that
in
legislative
history,
you
may
have
to
look
elsewhere.
and
as
we
read
this
court's
prior
decisions
in
this
field
of
preemption
as
applied
to
labor
relations,
we
understand
that
the
principal
basis
on
which
state
legislation
has
previously
been
stricken
down
has
been
a
finding
of
conflict
between
the
state
regulation
and
the
federal
policy
as
disclosed
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
think
it's
demonstrable
here
that
there
is
not
a
conflict
between
the
state
regulation
and
that
there
is
no
potential
conflict
so
long
as
state
regulation
is
confined
to
the
area
of
violent
and
coercive
union
conduct.
to
demonstrate
the
absence
of
actual
conflict
here,
we
have
to
go
in
part
at
least
to
the
proceeding
which
is
currently
pending
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
congress
--
because,
i
should
say,
the
appellant
has
based
its
principal
claim
of
actual
conflict
on
those
proceedings
even
though
they
are
not
a
matter
of
record
before
this
court.
pleadings
that
have
been
put
into
appellant's
appendix
show
this
in
regard
to
that
proceeding
which
is
currently
going
on
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
union
has
filed
a
charge
and
the
board
has
issued
a
complaint
that
the
company,
the
kohler
company,
has
refused
to
bargain
in
good
faith
with
the
union.
as
one
of
the
--
of
the
defenses
pleaded
in
our
answer,
we
set
up
the
fact
that
the
union
had
engaged
in
a
violent
and
coercive
course
of
conduct,
the
same
that
was
pleaded
in
this
wisconsin
case.
and
that
as
a
result
of
that
course
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
union,
we
were
relieved
of
the
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union
during
the
period
while
that
conduct
was
going
on.
we
put
in
evidence
to
support
that
defense
that
is
we
have
attempted
to
prove
to
the
board
that
the
union
did
in
fact
engage
in
this
violent
conduct.
we
say,
your
honors,
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
conflict
in
that
situation
for
this
simple
reason.
nothing
that
wisconsin
has
done
can
possibly
interfere
with
any
action
that
the
board
may
take
on
our
proof
of
that
defense.
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
concludes
that
in
fact
the
union's
conduct
was
unlawful,
it
will
then
come
to
the
legal
question
of
whether
that
unlawful
conduct
was
a
sufficient
excuse
for
our
declining
to
bargain
during
the
period
while
the
unlawful
conduct
continued.
mr.
jerome
powell
we
don't
base
it
directly
on
any
section
of
the
act,
your
honor.
we
take
the
position
that
the
act
does
not
--
that
it
will
not
enforce
or
--
or
it
will
not
express
the
basic
policies
of
the
act
to
compel
an
employer
to
bargain
directly
with
the
union
who
is
--
which
is
engaged
in
a
concerted
campaign
of
unlawful
conduct.
and
mind
you,
your
honors,
this
did
not
extend
over
any
great
period
of
time.
it
was
just
a
period
between
the
time
when
we
filed
our
complaint
with
the
wisconsin
board
and
the
time
when
the
wisconsin
board
issued
this
order.
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
might
find
that
this
conduct
which
we
have
now
attempted
to
prove
before
that
board
is
not
or
was
not
unlawful,
there
would
still
be
no
conflict
between
what
the
state
has
done
and
what
the
national
labor
relations
board
might
do
because
wisconsin
has
done
nothing
in
prohibiting
this
conduct
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
empowered
to
prevent
--
i
mean
to
protect.
there
is
no
potentiality
of
conflict
so
long
as
wisconsin's
regulation
stop
short
of
an
invasion
of
those
section
7
rights
which
the
congress
has
declared
shall
be
protected.
and
here
wisconsin
has
stopped
short.
mr.
jerome
powell
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
contend
that.
although,
wisconsin's
regulation,
of
course,
can
only
apply
intrastate
but
we
say
that
wisconsin
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers
which
congress
we
believe
has
not
displaced,
has
power
to
preserve
the
peace
here.
mr.
jerome
powell
because
wisconsin's
regulation
has
not
interfered
with
the
--
with
any
activity
which
is
protected.
in
other
words,
your
honors
--
mr.
jerome
powell
lies
that's
--
mr.
jerome
powell
definitely.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
wisconsin's
injunction
prohibits
nothing
which
is
protected
by
section
7.
it
prohibits
house
picketing.
it
prohibits
picketing
in
numbers
in
excess
of
250
at
one
time.
it
prohibits
blocking
of
streets
and
highways.
none
of
those
activities
can
conceivably
come
within
the
protection
of
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
view
of
this
court's
prior
decision
in
the
allen-bradley
case.
so,
there
is
no
possibility
even
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
should
determine
that
this
conduct
was
not
in
fact
unlawful,
there
is
no
possibility
that
the
wisconsin
prohibition
can
have
interfered
with
the
exercise
of
rights
guaranteed
by
section
7.
mr.
jerome
powell
there
may
be,
your
honors.
mr.
jerome
powell
yes,
that
is
a
possibility.
i
might
say
this
as
to
that.
that
possibility
existed
equally
when
allen-bradley
was
decided.
in
other
words,
to
the
extent
that
one
might
say
that
there
is
some
potential
difference
of
the
basis
of
finding
in
the
case.
that
was
equally
true
in
1942.
it
has
not
arisen
because
of
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
jerome
powell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
powell
exactly,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
amendment
of
section
7.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
order
to
make
out
a
case
which
does
not
fall
within
the
allen-bradley
rule,
appellant
here
must
show
some
reason
why
the
state
action
now
conflicts
with
federal
regulation
because
of
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
jerome
powell
yes,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
violence
and
coercion,
we
do
believe
so.
mr.
jerome
powell
with
respect
to
violence
and
coercion.
mr.
jerome
powell
yes,
your
honor,
it
did.
mr.
jerome
powell
we
still
think
that
it
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
to
displace
state
regulation
of
violence
and
coercion.
mr.
jerome
powell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerome
powell
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
has
--
i
think
it
has.
that
is
in
field
lying
outside
the
area
of
violence
and
coercion.
mr.
jerome
powell
it
does
not
as
such,
your
honor.
what
the
act
as
amended
permits
the
board
to
do
is
to
eliminate
certain
effects
of
violent
and
coercive
conduct.
the
act
as
amended
provides
that
it
--
this
is
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
on
which
the
claim
of
preemption
here
is
founded.
the
act
provides
that
it
shall
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
or
its
agents
to
coerce
or
restrain
employees
in
the
exercise
of
rights
guaranteed
by
section
7.
now,
your
honors
will
observe
from
that,
that
the
act
does
not
prohibit
any
specific
conduct.
it
prohibits
only
the
effect
of
conduct
on
employees
as
such.so
that
when
the
labor
board
issues
an
order
under
section
8
(b)
(1),
it
does
not
prohibit
a
labor
organization
or
its
agent
from
doing
anything.
it
only
says,
“in
doing
whatever
you
may
do,
you
shall
not
invade
the
rights
of
employees
guaranteed
by
section
7.”
and
the
result,
of
course,
of
that
very
limited
regulatory
power
in
the
board
is
to
leave
the
conduct
itself
unaffected.
