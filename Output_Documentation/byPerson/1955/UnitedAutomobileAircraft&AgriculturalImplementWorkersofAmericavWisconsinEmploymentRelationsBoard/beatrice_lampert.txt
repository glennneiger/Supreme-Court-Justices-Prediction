may
it
please
the
court.
the
judgment
which
is
challenged
in
this
case
proscribes
mass
picketing,
violence,
traffic
obstructions
and
related
activities.
as
i
understood
counsel
in
his
argument
yesterday,
the
authority
of
the
state
to
regulate
those
activities,
i
believe,
i
quote
correctly
when
i
say
"to
regulate
and
punish
those
activities
is
not
questioned."
as
i
understood
the
questioning,
i
believe
counsel
said
that
they
did
not
question
the
state's
authority
either
to
enter
injunctions
proscribing
such
conduct
in
equity
proceedings
on
the
application
of
private
parties
but
they
do
question
the
state's
authority
to
do
the
regulation
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
in
this
case.
i
think
therefore
it
may
be
more
helpful
if
i
start
out
on
a
practical
approach
to
the
problem
wisconsin
and
the
attempts
wisconsin
has
made
to
solve
the
problem.
i
--
i
think
that
there's
no
question
that
if
a
state
has
authority
to
preserve
the
peace
and
to
regulate
the
type
of
conduct
that
is
here
involved,
it
has
a
correlative
duty
unless
one
has
been
a
law
enforcement
officer
on
the
scene
of
a
mass
labor
dispute
with
all
the
bitterness,
the
hostility,
the
potential
explosiveness
to
others,
he
can't
possibly
realize
the
problem
that
it
is
involved,
but
he
--
they
can
realize
that
it
is
no
privilege
to
do
such
regulation,
it's
a
duty.
we
are
not
here
because
we're
power
hungry.
we're
here
because
we've
been
faced
with
the
demand
of
our
citizens
to
control
this
difficult
situation.
it's
not
something
that
we
would
like
to
do
if
anybody
else
is
willing
to.
anybody
--
any
agency
which
is
able
and
willing
to
control
the
situation
is
more
than
welcome.
but
up
to
date,
there
has
been
no
agency
but
ourselves
and
we
have
met
with
the
unpleasant
resentment
of
--
from
one
side
if
we
do
and
from
resentment
from
the
other
side
if
we
don't.
but
the
problem
is
there.
so
we
have
tried
to
meet
it
and
this
is
how
we
have
done
it.
we
feel
that
in
these
localities,
where
feelings
are
run
--
running
extremely
high
as
they
always
do
in
small
communities
where
there
is
a
labor
dispute,
that
we
must
have
a
method
that
is
far
enough
removed
from
the
disputants
themselves
to
be
impartial.at
the
same
time,
we
must
have
a
close
enough
and
flexible
enough
to
move
rapidly.
wisconsin,
i
think
both
legislatively
and
administratively,
has
made
an
honest
effort
to
meet
that
situation
without
encroaching
upon
the
area
which
we
believe
this
court
says
congress
has
intended
should
be
preempted.
the
legislative
plan
has
been
devised
in
an
attempt
to
find
something
more
expeditious
and
flexible
than
mere
punishment
and
putting
in
jail
of
individuals
and
also
to
meet
that
situation
of
impartiality
in
the
particular
dispute.
it
combines
some
of
the
elements
of
--
of
criminal
statutes,
some
of
the
elements
of
equity
injunction
procedure
but
with
the
more
objectionable
element
of
both
omitted
and
with
a
more
expeditious
and
effective
procedure,
we
believe,
substituted.
instead
of
the
general
proscription
of
say
mass
picketing
by
a
criminal
law
applicable
throughout
the
entire
state,
wisconsin
has
said
that
we
will
appoint
a
body
to
conduct
a
full
hearing
and
--
and
then
devise
and
define
those
proscriptions
according
to
the
particular
circumstances.
so
that
everybody
may
know
exactly
what
is
put
here
but
in
--
in
a
particular
case
instead
of
having
to
take
the
chance
of
deciding
for
himself
whether
two
or
five
or
ten
people
in
an
area
does
involve
and
constitute
mass
picketing.
now,
this
--
this
is
akin
to
the
formulation
of
a
statutory
definition
of
--
which
might
be
found
in
a
criminal
law.
it
does
not
involve
in
the
first
instance
any
penalty
at
all.
this
is
--
it
follows
a
full
hearing
and
which
both
sides
are
entitled
to
present
anything
they
feel
is
pertinent.
they
--
the
full
hearing
was
held
by
the
state
labor
board
in
this
case
and
it
found
there
have
been
assaults,
injury
to
property,
mass
picketing,
of
arrests,
obstruction
of
entrance
or
egress,
violence
of
various
types.
now,
it
is
--
it
was
suggested
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
appellant,
i
believe,
that
it
is
not
conceded
that
these
things
occur.
however,
the
appellant
did
not
elect
to
print
any
evidence.
we
are
before
the
court
on
basis
of
the
findings
and
since
what
is
prohibited
by
the
judgment
is
the
same
type
of
conduct
which
was
found
to
have
occurred.
presumably,
there
would
be
no
reason
for
being
here
if
they
had
not
occurred.
in
any
event,
the
kind
of
conduct
described
in
the
findings
of
the
board
is
all
that
is
prohibited.
so
that
if
it
did
not
occur
and
if
it
is
not
anticipated
by
the
appellants
that
they
want
to
engage
in
it
in
the
future,
certainly,
nobody
has
been
prejudiced.
now,
the
second
step
in
the
legislative
plan
is
a
full
court
review.
the
board's
order
carries
no
penalty
neither
does
it
mean
anything
until
it
has
been
enforced
by
a
court
of
law.
the
enforcement
is
strictly,
of
course,
on
review.
there's
no
more
evidence
but
the
enforcement
procedure
guarantees
the
right
of
all
parties
to
have
the
legal
issues
heard
and
have
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
board
acted
properly
within
its
authority
and
legally.
the
court
in
this
case,
it
has
been
suggested,
was
not
satisfied
with
the
order
but
felt
itself
bound
by
rules
of
law.
i
think,
perhaps,
counsel
drew
inferences
from
the
statement
quoted
in
the
brief
that
are
not
warranted.
i
think
there's
no
question
that
the
court
sitting
in
review
felt
that
it
would
like
to
get
out,
get
its
hands
on
the
said
dispute
and
settle
it
if
it
could.
it
would
like,
of
course,
as
any
appellate
court
would
to
--
to
solve
the
whole
problem
right
then
and
there.
so,
the
court
was
talking
about
the
fact
that
it
had
certain
restrictions
because
it
was
sitting
in
review
only
but
there
was
no
question
in
the
courts'
mind.
and
i
--
i
think
i
will
read
a
bit
of
the
--
just
a
bit
of
the
court's
decision
that
the
subject
matter
proscribed
was
perfectly,
properly
prohibited.
the
court
said
it
would
seem
most
unreasonable
and
illogical
if
any
court
should
hold
that
a
state
court
of
record
would
be
impotent
to
restrain
the
commission
of
acts
that
are
in
themselves
illegal
per
se.
there
is
no
inherent
right
on
the
part
of
individual
members
of
the
union
or
the
union
as
an
organization
or
its
officers
in
directing
it
to
engage
in
mass
picketing.
there
is
no
inherent
right
on
the
part
of
any
of
your
--
members
of
unions
to
intimidate,
to
threaten,
to
assault
or
to
unlawfully
interfere
with
the
liberties
of
any
person.
so,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
complaint
is
groundless
when
it
is
exerted
on
the
proposition
that
those
types
of
actions
should
not
be
restrained.
now,
that's
all
we're
doing
in
the
court
below.
none
of
the
courts
had
any
question
in
their
mind
if
what
the
board
had
done
was
proper,
of
course,
the
court
as
well
as
the
board
would
have
like
to
go
farther
and
settle
the
labor
dispute.
but
the
very
fact
that
we
restrained
ourselves
to
the
portion
of
the
area
which
is
properly
within
our
jurisdiction
should
not
be
a
point
of
criticism.
it
should
be
rather,
i
think,
a
recognition
that
we
have
tried
to
--
to
assume
our
proper
share
in
the
governmental
scheme
and
no
more.
now,
it
was
suggested,
i
think
at
this
point
it
might
be
well
to
--
to
take
up
the
discussion
that
was
held
yesterday
on
the
fact
that
--
that
counsel
apparently
concedes
that
it
would
be
proper
for
a
state
court
to
issue
an
injunction
against
this
identical
conduct
if
it
had
been
applied
for
by
a
private
party
and
issued
under
general
rules
of
equity.
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
state
board
has
discretion
to
grant
or
withhold
a
remedy
on
equitable
principles
fully
as
much
as
could
be
done
under
the
older
common
law
injunction
cases.
i
did
not
cite
the
case
in
my
brief,
and
i
will
cite
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
appleton
chair
corporation
versus
united
brotherhood,
239,
wis.337,
1
n.w.2d
188
in
which
there
was
wrongful
conduct
shown
before
the
board
on
the
part
of
both
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization.
the
board,
the
state
board,
issued
a
remedy
solely
against
the
employer.
the
employer
complained
that
that
was
not
proper,
that
it
had
been
shown
that
the
labor
organization
too
was
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practices.
nonetheless,
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
statute
contemplated
that
the
board
should
weigh
the
conduct
of
the
adverse
parties
and
should
give
what
remedy
at
peace
it
deemed
just
to
the
private
rights
and
necessary
for
the
public
protection.
and
it
is
not
true
in
any
event
in
most
states,
at
least,
including
wisconsin
that
an
injunction
can
be
obtained
in
connection
with
a
labor
dispute
irrespective
of
statutes
defining
the
labor
policy
of
the
state.
wisconsin
has,
as
most
states,
has
its
--
the
norris-laguardia
act
which
prescribes
principles
under
the
labor
policy
of
the
state
which
we
strict
the
issuance
of
injunctions
in
connection
with
labor
disputes
irrespective
of
who
the
moving
party
is.
all
right,
now,
that
is
the
second
step
to
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
wisconsin
has
a
little
norris–laguardia
act
almost
identical.
in
fact,
wisconsin
adopted
it
first
and
it
is
--
it
was
the
model
for
the
federal
statute.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
of
course
--
one
of
the
--
the
objections
--
some
of
the
objections
to
the
labor
injunction
suit,
of
course,
is
the
courts
are
too
busy
that
they
--
they
--
it
takes
a
long
time
for
them
to
get
around
to
a
trial
of
the
facts.
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
issue
ex
parte
injunctions
because
the
courts
didn't
have
time
to
--
to
try
the
cases
solely
to
--
those
were
reasons
why
wisconsin
felt
we
will
establish
a
labor
board
that
is
always
supposed
to
be
ready
at
a
moments
notice
to
take
care
of
an
emergency.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
it
was
about
a
little
over
a
month
from
this
case,
although
it
has
operated
much
more
rapidly
in
some
others.
i
think
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
exceedingly
long,
it
ran
through
many,
many
pages
which
is
probably
why
it
--
it
wasn't
printed
here.
the
hearings
themselves
took
days
and
days
but
the
order
of
the
board
was
out
in
a
little
over
a
month
from
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
if
i
may
say,
i
think
hereto,
it
was
suggested
in
argument
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
commented
that
by
the
time
the
case
got
to
it,
the
questions
relating
to
employer
conduct
were
not
pertinent
and
the
reason
it
said
so,
why
is
because
the
appellants
did
not
chose
to
bring
them
in
issue
in
this
case.
as
i
have
demonstrated
by
--
the
case
i
have
quite
quoted
to
the
court,
the
appleton
chair
case,
any
conduct
amounting
to
an
unfair
practice
could
have
been
alleged
as
a
counter
complaint
and
could
have
been
considered
by
the
board
if
appellant
said
he'd
like
you
to
do
so
but
if
they
--
they
preferred
to
take
it
to
some
other
agency,
obviously
there's
nothing
that
the
state
can
do
to
any
excess
of
its
jurisdiction
and
it
should
not
be
criticized
for
not
deciding
something
that
was
not
brought
before
it.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
no
--
no,
that's
not
true.
there
--
there
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
--
still
can
be
--
there
still
can
be
injunctive
suits
under
the
same
restrictions
as
are
applicable
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.however,
the
--
the
procedure
here
applied
is
additional.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
i
believe
it
could.
i
think
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
reasons
perhaps
why
it
was
not
is
--
i
will
go
into
a
little
later.
the
two
general
reasons
why
the
people
ordinarily
go
to
our
administrative
agency
is
that
it
is
faster
and
that
it
is
a
little
farther
away
from
the
scenes.
you
would
have
to
apply
for
your
--
to
--
for
your
injunction
in
a
local
court.
very
frequently,
their
court
--
the
judges
have
some
interest
that
impels
them
to
disqualify
themselves
and
it
is
sometimes
slow,
particularly
if
we
have
to
get
in
an
outside
judge.but
that
procedure
is
still
available
if
one
elects
to
pursue
it.
now,
then
up
to
that
stage,
we've
had
two
proceedings
and
we've
had
a
proceeding
before
the
board
and
proceeding
before
the
court
to
tell
people
what
is
proper
conduct
not
impinging
upon
the
public
interest
in
this
case
and
there
has
been
no
penalty
or
no
possibility
of
penalty
and
that
isn't
such
a
case
as
this.
the
third
step
before
we
can
have
any
penalty
or
at
least
in
practice
before
we
have
had
any
penalty
involves
a
civil
contempt
proceeding.
that
is
a
full
court,
full
desk
court
proceeding,
with
the
board
restricted
by
exactly
the
same
rules
that
apply
to
any
other
--
a
hold
or
other
judgment
in
a
civil
action.
it
must
file
its
pleadings
which
must
be
verified
affidavits.
it
must
give
notice.
there
must
be
a
full
trial
before
a
court
record,
only
then,
if
the
court
finds
that
after
these
previous
two
steps
have
been
taken,
can
anybody
be
penalized.
at
least
in
practice,
that
is
the
way
in
which
all
these
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs
have
come
to
the
courts
and
up
to
this
court.
under
our
civil
contempt
statutes,
aside
from
the
payment
of
damages
to
injured
parties,
the
limit,
the
absolute
outside
limit
of
any
penalty
which
could
be
imposed
for
violation
of
this
judgment
is
$250
in
fine
or
six
months
in
jail.
and
i
assure
you,
we
do
not
exercise
even
that
small
sanction
indiscriminately.
for
many,
many
years,
i
am
the
only
counsel
the
state
board
has
had.
it
develops
upon
me
to
conduct
these
contempt
proceedings
and
they
are
arduous,
we
don't
do
them
except
as
a
last
resort.
so
there
have
been
very
few
people
actually
penalized
under
this
procedure.
the
idea
is
to
let
them
know
what
they
can
and
cannot
do
and
a
great
majority
of
people
want
to
do
what
they
should
when
they
know.
so
that
is
the
procedure
upon
we
--
which
we
have
come
up
here.
now,
the
factual
background,
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
important
in
determining
why
we
can't
just
simply
rely
on
arrests
and
imprisonment.
this
dispute
occurred
in
a
village
of
less
than
2000
population.
many
of
the
employees
of
the
company
involved
come
from
other
communities
so
that
the
number
of
striking
employees
exceeded
the
total
population
of
the
village.
they
were
aided
by
affiliates
and
of
persons
assigned
to
assist
from
other
places
and
by
sympathizers
in
the
area.
so
that
the
number
of
persons
engaged
in
mass
picketing
exceeded
the
total
number
of
residents
in
the
village
--
i
mean
exceeded
in
engaging
in
picketing
activities.
i
think
it
can
be
taken
as
common
knowledge
that
in
a
village
of
that
size,
there
is
not
more
than
a
handful
of
policemen
who
are
not
trained
for
mob
control.
their
average
duty
will
probably
be
at
the
most
making
an
arrest
of
a
single
citizen
at
a
time
for
--
i
don't
--
bringing
--
(inaudible)
at
a
neighbor's
guard.
they
--
i
expected
them
under
the
criminal
procedure
to
go
out
among
these
2000
people
and
put
in
enough
people
and
arrest
them
and
go
start
the
wheels
of
the
criminal
procedure
running
to
keep
the
matter
under
control.
well,
not
only,
even
if
they
could
do
that,
there
are
still
further
difficulties.
a
small
community
involves
almost
always,
at
least
a
dozen
in
wisconsin
certainly
elected
enforcement
officials
including
prosecuting
attorneys
and
judges.
in
that
community,
where
a
large
dispute
of
this
nature
is
going
on,
everybody
has
an
opinion,
everybody
is
concerned.
drawing
a
jury
which
has
no
opinion
on
an
unsolved
case,
for
instance,
would
take
weeks.
a
prosecuting
attorney
who
is
too
zealous
may
be
unable
to
finish
his
cases
because
an
election
intervenes.
a
judge
and
that
is
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case
that
the
judge,
even
the
one
who
had
to
hear
the
board's
petition
for
enforcement
which
was
solely
reviewed,
disqualified
himself
because
he
had
been
criticized
before
sitting
on
an
assault
case,
when
he
had
stock
in
a
grocery
store
or
interested
in
a
grocery
store
where
some
of
the
strikers
were
trading.
those
things
make
it
a
practical
problem
in
most
communities
to
try
to
control
by
this
criminal
procedure
which
goes
on
for
months
and
months
and
months
when
the
courts
are
crowded.
if
we
had
2000
people
participating
and
tried
them
each
individually
and
do
a
criminal
process,
the
strike
would
long,
long,
long
be
over
before
anybody
would
be
brought
to
test.
the
--
and
i
have
--
i
have,
i
think,
explained
why
the
--
the
state
has
offered
this
additional
method
into
the
common
law
method
of
injunction
on
basis
of
the
private
party.
i
think,
possibly,
this
is
one
of
the
cases
in
which
the
administrative
procedure
before
the
board
was
simply
for
the
private
party
than
finding
a
judge
who
would
be
willing
to
sit
in
a
private
injunction
suit.
now,
secondly,
that
--
that
is
the
legislative
process
which
has
tried
to
find
a
practical
solution
to
what
it
deems
to
be
of
duty
not
of
privilege.
secondly,
the
board
has
made
an
honest
effort
in
this
case
to
abstain
from
the
area
which
it
understands
that
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
preempted.
as
--
we
will
show
and
i'm
bringing
--
about
to
show,
i
think,
now
that
there
is
actually
no
duplication
of
any
function
which
can
be
exercised
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
but
i
--
i
--
in
doing
so,
i
don't
want
to
be
understood
as
indicating
that
the
action
would
be
improper
if
there
were
duplication.
the
legislative
records
we
have
quoted
have
said
expressly
that
in
these
extreme
cases
and
surely,
violence
is
an
extreme
case,
then
there's
no
objection
that
there
is
duplication.
counsel
did
suggest
in
his
--
in
its
reply
brief
that
there
is,
and
i
quote,
“a
dearth
of
references
to
state
labor
laws
except
in
connection
with
10
(a)
and
14
(b)."
well,
now,
we
could
have
quoted
many
more
than
we
did
but
we
quoted
at
least
four
in
our
brief.
one
appears
on
page
8
which
--
in
which
representative
kristen
of
wisconsin
questioned
mr.
hartley
and
said,
“now,
does
this
law
--
and
this
was
not
in
connection
with
10
(a)
or
14
(b),
said,
"does
this
law
leave
as
much
as
it's
possible
to
states?"
leave
it
to
them
to
settle
disputes
at
the
state
level
and
--
and
kristen
--
and
he
spoke
expressly
of
the
wisconsin
law,
the
very
law
that
is
here
before
the
court.
and
mr.
taft
and
mr.
hartley
said,
“yes,
that's
the
intention
of
this
law,
the
law
as
a
whole.”
on
page
8
--
or
on
page
10,
mr.
--
i
think
it
was
senator
ball
who
made
reference
to
the
allis-chalmers
strike
as
being
one
of
the
types
of
things
that
--
where
there
was
state
control.
the
activities
in
the
allis-chalmers
strike
have
--
it
was
a
year
or
two
before
that
were
very,
very
similar
to
this
case
excepting
on
a
greater
scale.
and
senator
ball
told
the
congress
at
that
time
that
those
things
that
were
--
were
controlled
by
state
law
and
by
state
law
he
could
have
meant
only
the
law
that
was
involved
in
the
allis-chalmers
case
which
came
to
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari
and
which
certiorari
was
denied,
the
identical
law.
and
he
referred
--
it
is
suggested
that
when
he
referred
to
peace
officers,
he
wasn't
referring
to
labor
boards
but
to
a
larger
extent.
i,
counsel
for
the
labor
board,
consider
myself
a
peace
officer
of
the
labor
board.
the
traffic
policeman,
all
those
who
have
other
duties
are
also
peace
officer,
every
law
enforcement
officer
is
in
essence
fundamentally
a
peace
officer.
that
is
the
very
basic
part
of
our
governmental
protection
which
the
citizens
expect.
we
start
with
that
on
the
assumption
and
then
go
on
to
the
more
specialized
duties.
then
at
page
11
of
our
brief,
we've
--
we
have
quoted,
senator
wiley's
reference
to
wisconsin
and
other
states
labor
boards.
and
at
page
17,
we've
--
we've
quoted
in
a
footnote
senator
taft's
actual
quotation
to
congress
of
the
very
section
of
the
wisconsin
law
which
is
primarily
here
involved.
so
certainly,
when
they
were
talking
about
and
there
are
many
others
which
we
didn't
have
time
or
space
to
quote
of
course,
but
when
they
were
talking
about
continuing
state
jurisdiction
and
at
the
same
time
talking
about
these
very
laws,
surely,
had
they
meant
to
exempt
regulation
by
this
type
of
law,
they
would
have
made
it
clearer
in
their
arguments
or
in
the
wording
of
the
law.
now,
i
wish,
however,
to
go
ahead
now
and
try
to
demonstrate
the
point
that
i
referred
to
earlier
that
the
board
tried
to
apply
only
those
portions
of
the
wisconsin
law
which
do
not
involve
infringement
on
an
area
which
this
court
has
held
has
been
preempted.
this
court
recognized
in
the
allen-bradley
case
which
has
been
many
times
cited
that
the
part
of
the
state
law
which
will
be
considered
for
purposes
of
validity
is
only
that
part
which
is
applied
in
the
specific
case.
that
we
--
we
concede
that
there
are
other
parts
of
the
wisconsin
law
including
one
almost
comparable
to
section
8
(b)
(1)
which
is
the
basis
of
the
claim
of
conflict
in
this
case
but
they
have
not
been
applied
here.
so
our
question
as
to
validity
of
the
state
action
depends
only
on
the
action
itself,
the
findings
and
the
specific
provisions
of
law
under
which
they
are
authorized.
now,
counsel
objected
yesterday
to
our
reference
to
the
fact
that
wisconsin
law
is
not
concerned
solely
with
employer-employee
relations.
it
makes
it
an
unfair
practice
for
any
person
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
conduct
defining
that
the
law
is
unfair
and
counsel
said
that
we
did
not
apply
that
provision
in
this
case
but
we
did.
the
greatest,
thus
far,
the
greatest
number
of
persons
who
are
restrained
by
this
judgment
are
members
of
the
union,
2000
or
so
at
least.
we
couldn't
possibly
have
included
them
in
this
proscription
had
it
not
been
for
this
provision
because
we
did
not
attempt
to
decide
on
anybody's
employee
status.
we
have
--
it
was
suggested
that
the
wisconsin
employment
peace
act
regulates
only
labor
relations.
it
does,
of
course,
regulate
labor
relations.
but
in
addition,
the
legislature
has
said
it
also
regulates
the
relations
between
third
parties
and
the
public
and
those
participants
in
the
labor
dispute
who
may
go
out
and
infringe
on
third
party's
rights.
i
find
that
in
our
section
111.02
--
no,
111.01
subparagraph
(2)
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
is
quoted
at
pages
56
to
57
of
our
brief
has
been
there
wrongly
cited.
the
--
the
proper
citation
is
111.01
(2).
the
legislature
said
there,
"it
is
also
recognized
that
whatever
may
be
the
rights
of
disputants
with
respect
to
each
other
in
any
controversy
regarding
employment
relations
whatever
those
may
be
and
disregarding
them,
they
should
not
be
permitted
in
the
conduct
of
their
controversy
regarding
employment
relations
to
intrude
directly
into
the
primary
rights
of
third
parties
to
earn
a
livelihood,
transact
business
and
engage
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
by
any
lawful
means
and
free
from
molestation,
interference,
restrain
or
coercion."
ms.
beatrice
lampert
might
be
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
not
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
not
only
those,
it
might
be
a
truck
driver
who
wants
to
get
in
and
deliver
some
employer's
goods
or
somebody
who
wants
to
call
to
sell
some
goods
to
the
company
or
anybody
who
might
want
to
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
well
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes,
he
could
because
the
--
the
board
did
not
find
any
such
outsiders
in
this
case
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
--
but
they
--
they
have
in
other
cases
because
this
subsection
111.06
(3)
makes
it
an
unfair
practice
for
any
person
even
if
we
had
absolutely
--
if
--
even
if
he
were
just
a
saboteur
say
and
had
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
dispute.
if
he
comes
in
and
tries
to
stir
up
a
riot,
he
is
subject
to
the
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that
would
--
not
that
i
know
of,
no.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
not
that
i
know
of.
the
only
thing
that
i
could
think
of
that
might
possibly
be
involved
under
our
criminal
law
would
be
our
peaceful
assemblage
--
unlawful
assemblage.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
oh,
yes.
yes
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes,
indeed.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes,
that
would
cover
the
--
the
few
people
that
engaged
in
that.
now,
if
there
were
2000
people
picketing,
perhaps
not
more
than
50
engaged
in
assault
and
battery
who
could
be
arrested
but
they
were
--
at
the
same
time
the
people
there
were
in
the
mood
so
that
all
they
needed
was
a
little
stirring
up
and
there
would
--
might
have
been
a
great
many
more.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
and
there
was
actual
assemblage
in
the
streets
that
--
whether
it
was
mass
picketing
or
otherwise,
that
assemblage
in
the
streets
in
connection
with
this
kind
of
a
dispute
is
an
unfair
practice
if
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
--
it
interferes
with
traffic.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
i'm
sure
it
could.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes,
i'm
sure
it
could.
it
could
not
be
dealt
with
as
effectually
perhaps
as
by
this
procedure
but
you
could
--
you
could
send
down
if
you
had
enough
traffic
policemen,
enough
to
disperse
the
groups.
i
think,
perhaps,
it
could
be
dealt
with
under
the
traffic
law
say
but
that
of
course
takes
a
personnel
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes,
sir,
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
all
--
the
state
unquestionably
has
power
to
deal
with
this.
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
expediency
now,
perhaps
a
different
thing
than
power.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
--
there's
no
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
we're
trying
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
but
we
--
i
was
explaining
that
we're
trying
to
deal
with
all
these
in
one,
yes,
we
would
have
power
to
deal
with
everything
that
happened
in
this
case.
there
were
hundreds
of
violations
of
criminal
law
and
there's
a
violation
of
traffic
law,
hundreds
of
infringements
on
rights
of
other
people.
we
could
have
dealt
with
all
those
separately
of
course.
there
could
have
been
hundreds
of
those
and
there's
no
question
of
our
authority
to
do
it.
as
i
understand,
counsel
hasn't
conceded
that
but
it's
simply
is
not
practical
or
effectual
to
do
it
that
way.
so,
we
have
done
it
and
if
we've
got
power
to
do
it,
surely,
and
have
the
duty
to
do
it,
the
power,
we
don't
care
about.
if
somebody
else
wants
to
assume
the
duty
with
the
power
they
can
have
it.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
but
if
we've
got
the
duty
to
do
it,
we've
surely
got
the
--
the
power
to
do
it
the
most
effectual
day.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
it
was
initiated
by
a
complaint
before
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
board
by
the
kohler
company.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
the
procedure
--
but
to
that
extent,
it
is
analogous
to
the
application
for
an
injunction
in
--
in
courts
of
equity.
it
has
--
the
proceeding
has
to
be
initiated
by
some
party
in
interest.
it
could
have
been
initiated
by
any
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
--
person
whose
rights
were
infringed.
was
that
all
of
that
question,
your
honor?
right
now
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right
and
even
applicants
for
jobs
--
oh,
in
that
--
in
that
connection,
i
--
i
think
perhaps
i
should
infringe
a
lower
of
my
colleagues
time
to
explain
how
the
board
tried
to
stay
away
from
deciding
questions
that
remain
to
be
decided
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
they
tried
to
preserve
the
situation
so
that
when
the
national
board
decides
the
questions
before
it,
which
have
been
pending
for
years,
there
will
be
something
on
which
the
national
board's
decision
can
operate.
but
in
--
in
trying
to
preserve
that,
the
board
very
carefully
tried
to
refrain
and
--
and
not
--
and
honestly,
it
tried
to
avoid
any
--
any
area
which
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
go
into.
this
--
the
state
board
has
many
times
dismissed
cases
on
grounds
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
the
state
court
has
done
so.
of
course,
the
state
court
had
--
felt
it
had
jurisdiction
until
this
court
decided
differently
in
several
cases.
it
has
--
for
instance,
in
cases
similar
to
the
garner
situation,
it
has
believed
that
the
state
had
jurisdiction
until
the
garner
decision.
but
after
the
garner
decision,
it
immediately
dismissed
any
matters
involving
many
peaceful
picketing
on
the
grounds
of
illegal
objective.
here,
however,
there
are
two
provisions
of
the
state
board's
order
that
are
absolutely
unconnected
with
any
employer-employee
relations.
everybody
involved
in
this
case
is
proscribed
from
obstructing
or
interfering
in
anyway
with
ingress
to
or
egress
from
the
kohler
(obstructing
or
interfering
with
the
free
and
uninterrupted
use
of
public
roads,
streets,
highways,
railways
or
private
drives
leading
to
the
premises
of
the
kohler
company).
the
--
that
--
there
is
added
to
that
a
limitation
of
the
number
of
pickets.
the
board
has
said
that
when
you
go
over
200
pickets
in
that
area,
in
that
village,
you're
mass
picketing.
you
can
--
you
can
go
up
to
200
pickets
without
violating
this
order,
25
at
any
one
gate.
that
certainly
is
enough
to
advertise
a
labor
dispute.
that
--
those
--
those
matters
are
quite
irrespective
of
whether
the
--
the
picketing,
the
obstruction
is
engaged
in
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
employees
and
their
right
or
whether
it
is
engaged
in
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
merely
keeping
people
out,
business
out
or
whether
it's
out
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
visitors
out
for
any
reason.
that
--
that
is
proscribed
because
of
the
public
interest
and
the
interest
of
the
third
parties
which
has
been
pronounced
by
the
legislature
there.
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
itself
has
recognized
that
it
has
no
authority
and
--
and
will
not
try
to
proscribe
mass
picketing
as
such.
it
says
--
it
said
in
the
corey
corporation
case
signed
and
cited
in
the
brief
that
it
had
no
authority
to
affirmatively
regulate
the
number
of
persons
who
may
probably
picket
an
establishment,
it's
--
and
said
then
that
is
primarily
a
matter
for
local
authorities.
all
right,
now,
another
part,
the
other
part
of
the
board's
order,
sections
1
and
2
of
the
proscription
are
the
ones,
i
believe,
on
which
counsel
primarily
relies
in
his
suggestion
that
there
has
been
an
infringement
of
preempted
area.
the
board,
however,
referring
thereto
for
making
any
decision
as
to
who
were
or
who
were
not
entitled
to
protections
as
employees.
as
i
pointed
out,
the
state
law
does
have
a
parallel
provisions,
section
8
(b)
(1)
which
proscribes
or
makes
it
an
unfair
practice
to
coerce
employees
in
their
enjoinment
of
their
legal
rights
guaranteed
by
--
in
this
federal
law
at
section
7
and
the
state
law
at
section
111.04
(4)
i
think
it
is.
the
board
may
absolutely
no
reference
to
that
section.
it
did
not
refer
to
employees
nor
did
it
--
it
proscribed
coercion
of
employees
in
their
rights
as
employees.
it
referred
to
the
section
--
the
portion
of
that
section
of
the
law
which
does
proscribe
coercion
by
picketing
domiciles
and
that's
the
only
part
of
that
provision
of
the
law
which
paralleled
the
federal
law
which
was
referred
to
by
the
state
board.
and
that
matter,
a
picketing
of
domiciles
per
se
is
not
covered
by
the
federal
law.
now,
the
state
board
in
its
order
proscribed
not
coercion
of
employees
but
coercion
of
persons
desiring
to
be
employed
by
the
kohler
company.
and
now,
the
first
reason
they
did
that
was
a
recognition
undoubtedly
that
if
any
disciplinary
action
were
exerted
by
the
employer,
it
would
be
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
--
to
decide
whether
these
people
were
or
were
not
employees,
so
the
board
--
state
board
hasn't
tried
on
that
face
of
the
matter
at
all.
secondly,
it
--
it
made
it
clear,
though
there
are
many
people
who
wanted
to
apply
for
jobs
that
were
not
--
couldn't,
under
any
circumstances,
be
considered
employees
who
couldn't
even
get
in
to
file
their
applications.
so,
the
board
said,
“you
shan't
coerce
a
person
desiring
to
be
employed."
and
then
it
says,
“you
shan't
coerce
them
with
respect
to
legal
rights,"
not
the
legal
rights
guaranteed
under
section
111.04
or
the
legal
rights
guaranteed
by
section
7
of
the
federal
law.
there
has
been
no
reference
to
that
and
that's
a
very
significant
omission.
the
board
is
distinguishing
and
--
and
prohibiting
the
infringement
upon
people's
right
to
be
free
in
using
the
streets
going
where
they
please
from
attack,
from
obstruction
and
that
sort
of
thing.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
beatrice
lampert
no,
this
--
there
was
no
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
it
affected.
yes,
it
affected
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes.
no
question.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
well,
we
feel
that
we
have
the
reserve
power
that
that
is
an
area
in
which
congress
has
definitely,
in
all
these
statements
that
we
have
quoted
and
many,
many
more,
said
is
left
to
state
because
it
is
the
state
as
the
unit
which
is
--
which
is
primarily
charged
with
maintaining
peace
and
good
order
in
their
own
communities.
this
is
not
an
area
where
--
where
there
is
interstate
commerce.
every
bit
of
this
activity
took
place
in
one
small
community
area
in
wisconsin.
it
was
all
intrastate
business
that
was
involved.
the
reason
that
congress
has
legislated
with
respect
to
such
countries
--
companies
as
kohler
is
not
because
they
are
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
but
because
they
do
send
their
goods
in
interstate
commerce
and
business
affects
commerce.
but
they
live
in
--
in
regulating
the
commerce
aspect,
the
regulation
of
the
local
aspect
where
the
companies
do
business
to
the
community
primarily
concerned
and
to
the
only
the
community
which
can
step
in
immediately
and
prevent
mob
violence.
congress
didn't
intend
to
undertake
that
responsibility
in
the
federal
law
unless
the
state
and
local
governments
fail.
that
was
said
again
and
again
and
again
in
the
debates.
if
the
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
no,
no.
this
is
--
i
have
not
discussed
section
10
(a)
at
all.
these
debates
that
we
have
quoted
and
the
ones
that
we
have
referred
to
are
all
with
respect
to
the
law
in
general.
section
10
(a)
was
not
intended
in
anyway
to
restrict
state
rights
beyond
what
they
had
been
restricted
before.
that
was
intended
to
increase
state
rights
in
cases
where
there
was
actual
preemption,
but
it
did
not
intend
to
infer
or
to
imply
that
there
would
be
preemption.
it
simply
meant
that
where
there
had
been
preemption
and
still
in
certain
cases,
the
--
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
could
authorize
states
to
act.
but
where
they
had
been
no
preemption,
of
course,
there's
no
need
any
authority
in
the
part
of
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
to
authorize
states
to
do
something
that
they
had
reserved
power
to
do
anyway.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes,
your
honor.
i
assume
that
there
would
be
one
limitation
to
that,
we
could
not
act
even
with
respect
to
peace
and
good
order
in
such
a
manner
as
to
deprive
anybody
of
what
rights
guaranteed
by
the
federal
law
nor
could
we
act
in
such
a
manner
as
to
conflict
or
as
to
authorize
anything
prohibited
by
the
federal
law.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
well,
we
--
we
feel
that
in
this
case
we
have
not
enforced
a
labor
relations
law,
we
have
reinforced
only
that
part
of
the
labor
relations
law
which
deals
with
debates
of
third
party.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes
--
yes,
they
would.
each
individual
would've
been
entitled
to
a
jury
for
trial
and
trial
under
the
criminal
law.
he
would
also
be
subject
to
penalty.
we
see
we
don't
have
a
penalty
here
at
all.
if
we
could
handle
it
by
means
of
putting
2000
people
in
jail,
it
seems
to
us
that
it's
infinitely
preferable
and
surely
congress
intended
that
we
should
be
able
to
handle
it
by
some
means
avoiding
putting
2000
people
in
jail
and
letting
them
know
in
advance
what
--
exactly
what
things
they
cannot
do,
the
--
exactly
the
same
things
that
is
disagreed
--
agreed
by
everybody
are
unlawful
per
se,
things
that
the
--
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
not
authorize,
things
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
not
prohibit
per
se,
things
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
reach
only
indirectly
and
only
partially.
the
board
has
said
itself
that
it
could
not
prohibit
mass
picketing
as
such.
all
it
can
do
is
say,
“we
prohibit
you
from
interfering
with
the
rights
of
the
kohler
company
employees
by
mass
picketing.”
well,
that
is
--
is
far,
far
short
of
clearing
our
streets
so
the
people
can
get
through.
the
national
labor
relations
board,
incidentally,
has
always
in
all
the
previous
cases
i
have
been
before
this
court
has
appeared
to
--
in
support
of
its
own
jurisdiction
and
to
oppose
a
jurisdiction.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
it
is
not
doing
so
in
this
case.
it
is
elected
not
to
appear.
when
it
believes
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
record.
counsel
for
the
appellant,
i
believe,
solicited
their
appearance
and
they
--
i
have
had
a
copy
of
a
letter
from
the
national
board
to
direct
--
address
the
counsel
saying
they
elected
not
to
appear,
not
to
file
a
brief
as
a
friend
of
the
court.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
they're
not
here.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
and
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that's
significant
in
view
of
the
history
of
labor
legislation
--
labor
litigation
before
this
court
in
all
previous
cases
which
i
have
had
the
duty
to
argue,
the
national
board
has
appeared.
and
in
the
--
and
in
some
cases
where
a
state
has
proceeded
to
act,
the
national
board
has
appeared
as
a
litigant
as
in
the
capital
service
case.
they
know
if
--
how
to
protect
their
interest
if
they
feel
they
are
being
infringed.
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
they
are
not
here
in
this
case
indicates
that
this
is
one
they
believe
is
covered
by
the
statement
made
by
chairman
herzog
before
the
congressional
committee
indicating
that
they
believe
this
to
be
appropriate
area
for
state
jurisdiction.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
satisfactory
with
the
--
us
certainly.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
right.
i
have
only
one
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
i
--
i
think
the
testimony
of
chairman
herzog
is
referred
to
on
page
70
of
the
brief
and
at
the
bottom
it
said,
“this
statement
continues
to
represent
the
board's
present
views."
that
was
in
1953.
of
course,
it's
very
possible,
the
views
may
have
changed,
but
i
--
i
mean
that
it
seems
to
me
that
that
statement
taken
with
the
fact
that
the
board
has
not
seen
fit
to
try
to
stay
these
proceedings
would
indicate
that
that
--
that
statement
applies
in
this
situation.
i
had
wished
to
discuss
the
briggs-stratton
case
a
little
more
detail,
but
i
would
like
to
leave
a
little
time
for
my
colleague.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
may
i
be
permitted?
it
seems
to
me
that
last
statement
whether
a
bit
beyond
rebuttal
as
to
what
the
wisconsin
board
does
or
does
not
do.
i
represent
the
wisconsin
board.
it
has
never
made
any
ruling
that
it
will
not
take
a
complaint
from
somebody
who's
not
an
employee
or
in
(inaudible).
ms.
beatrice
lampert
yes,
it
has.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
i
couldn't.
i'm
sorry
--
ms.
beatrice
lampert
no,
it
is
not
a
usual
thing.
ms.
beatrice
lampert
that's
a
very
rare
thing.
it's
a
rare
thing
because
the
complaints
are
voluntary.
they
are
not
solicited
by
the
board.
they
come
in
--
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
except
upon
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
the
complaints
are
usually
filed
by
somebody
close
to
the
situation
with
the
most
proximate
interest.
