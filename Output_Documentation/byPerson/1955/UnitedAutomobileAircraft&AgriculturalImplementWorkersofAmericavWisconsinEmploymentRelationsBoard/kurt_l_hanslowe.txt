mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin.
this
court,
noting
probable
jurisdiction
on
january
30th
of
this
year.
the
issue
in
the
case
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
board
to
investigate
and
enjoin
in
a
state
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
the
kind
of
conduct
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
empowered
to
investigate
and
to
prohibit.
the
wisconsin
tribunals
upheld
the
state
jurisdiction
throughout
when
the
appellant
here
has
attacked
such
jurisdiction.
in
addition,
the
states
of
texas,
utah
and
georgia
had
filed
briefs
amicus
urging
this
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
the
appellant
is
a
labor
organization
certified
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
represent
the
employees
of
the
appellee,
kohler
company,
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
the
certification
followed
a
regular
federal
statutory
representation
proceeding
and
the
certification
issued
on
june
19th
of
1952.
on
april
5,
1954,
a
strike
commenced
the
--
at
the
kohler
company
following
unsuccessful
negotiations
for
a
new
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
employees
of
the
kohler
company
picket
at
the
premises.
on
april
15,
1954,
some
10
days
after
the
commencement
of
the
strike,
the
kohler
company
filed
a
complaint
with
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
board
charging
the
appellant
and
others
with
unfair
labor
practices
within
the
meaning
of
the
wisconsin
employment
peace
act
which
is
the
wisconsin
labor
statute.
the
gist
of
kohler's
complaint
was
that
the
appellant
and
others
had
engaged
in
mass
picketing
in
the
obstruction
of
egress
and
ingress
in
the
picketing
of
employees'
homes
and
threats
of
violence
and
violence
and
in
the
obstruction
of
traffic.
it
was
alleged
by
the
kohler
company
that
by
so
doing,
the
employees
of
the
kohler
company
have
been
coerced,
employees
who
did
not
want
to
work,
but
who
--
who
did
not
want
to
strike
but
wanted
to
work
and
that
other
people,
in
addition,
were
prevented
from
having
access
to
the
premises
of
the
kohler
company.
on
may
21st,
1954,
the
wisconsin
board
entered
an
order
finding
the
appellant
and
others
to
have
committed
these
unfair
labor
practices
and
directing
them
to
cease
and
desist
from
committing
them
in
the
future.
this
order
of
the
wisconsin
board
was
enforced
by
the
circuit
court
for
sheboygan
county,
wisconsin
on
august
13,
1954,
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
on
may
3,
1955.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
its
decision
took
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
the
business
of
the
kohler
company
affected
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
also
took
cognizance
of
past
and
pending
assertion
of
jurisdiction
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
over
the
labor
relations
of
the
kohler
company,
both
in
representation
and
in
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.
the
holding
of
the
wisconsin
court
was
that
although
the
taft-hartley
act
regulated
a
union
unfair
labor
practices,
nevertheless,
the
action
of
the
wisconsin
labor
board
constituted
a
valid
exercise
of
the
state's
police
power.
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
--
to
well
briefly
on
the
n.l.r.b.proceedings
of
which
the
wisconsin
court
took
cognizance.
there
were
two
representation
proceedings,
one
of
which
i've
already
mentioned
that
resulted
in
the
certification
of
the
appellant.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
decided
by
the
labor
board
on
april
12,
1954,
and
enforced
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
the
decision
being
reported
at
220
f.2d,
page
3.
in
addition,
the
national
labor
relations
board
issued
a
complaint
on
october
26,
1954,
that
is
to
say,
some
six
months
after
the
commencement
of
the
strike,
this
case
is
n.l.r.b.case
13-ca-1780.
now,
it's
indicated
that
n.l.r.b.proceeding
resulted
out
of
the
same
strike
which
precipitated
the
state
board
proceeding
here
involved.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
that,
your
honor,
is
a
proceeding
against
the
company
on
charges
filed
by
the
union.
the
charges
are
refusal
to
bargain,
discrimination,
and
other
forms
of
interference
and
coercion
of
the
employees
of
the
kohler
company.we
have
added,
if
the
court
please,
to
our
record
as
appendix
c
excerpts
from
the
pleadings
of
that
case,
and
we
are
asking
the
case
to
take
judicial
notice
of
those
pleadings,
they
--
that
those
pleadings
are
not
in
the
record
necessarily
because
the
state
proceeding
preceeded
the
federal
proceeding.
we
do
not
believe
it
is
inappropriate
for
us
to
ask
the
court
to
take
notice
of
this
pending
proceeding.
the
significant
thing,
we
believe,
about
this
still
continuing
federal
board
proceeding
is
that
the
kohler
company,
in
that
case
has
pleaded
the
same
conduct
of
the
appellant
in
defense
of
the
federal
unfair
labor
practice
charges
which
conduct
formed
the
basis
of
the
state
board
proceeding.
we
have
reproduced,
as
i
said,
those
pleadings
in
the
appendix,
and
on
page
17
(c)
of
our
brief,
there
is
a
--
the
relevant
excerpt
then
our
brief
is
the
green
document.
the
kohler
company
alleged
in
that
case,
that
is
the
federal
case,
that
the
union
was
not
bargaining
in
good
faith
in
that
beginning
april
5
and
continuing
to
date
and
engaged
in
supported,
urged,
and
fostered,
coerced
of
an
illegal
conduct
including
interfering
by
force,
threats,
intimidation
and
mass
pickets
with
persons
desiring
to
pursue
lawful
work
and
employment
for
the
respondent.
attempting
by
such
means
to
prevent
lawful
work,
i
shall
not
continue
reading.
i
shall
simply
say
that
the
conduct
there
pleaded
is
precisely
the
same
conduct
with
which
we
were
charged
in
the
state
proceeding.
now,
the
first
thing
which
becomes
apparent
from
the
state
of
affairs
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
first
thing
that
becomes
apparent
from
this
state
of
affairs
is
that
the
situation
is
one
quite
obviously
right
with
conflict.
it
is
entirely
conceivable
that
the
testimony
on
these
issues
was
--
will
not
be
the
same
before
the
two
agencies.
if
it's
entirely
conceivable
that
even
if
the
testimony
were
the
same,
the
two
agencies
will
not
place
the
same
interpretation
upon
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
proceeding,
it's
going
on
now,
there
are
indications
that
the
testimony
on
these
issues
is
not
the
same.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
the
remedy
in
the
true
proceeding
is
not
the
same
since
the
federal
proceeding
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
sir?
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
the
remedies
are
the
same
in
the
sense
that
they
are
both
unfair
labor
practice
remedies.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes,
but
in
the
state
proceeding,
of
course,
the
remedy
wasn't
directed
against
the
union
whereas
in
the
federal
proceeding,
it
will
be
directed
against
the
employer,
but
they
are
indeed
the
same
remedy.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
under
labor
practice
proceedings,
the
same
--
while
the
relief
is,
of
course,
not
the
same
since
it
would
be
directed
against
the
two
parties.
now
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
the
judgment
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
on
page
31
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes.
the
record
is
the
brown
book.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i'm
sorry.
it
is
pages
17
--
well,
that
your
honor
is
the
--
that
is
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
is
on
page
31
of
the
record.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes,
your
honor.
that
judgment
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
it
is
a
cease-and-desist
order.
affirming
any
effect
of
cease-and-desist
order
entered
by
wisconsin
board.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
of
the
federal
board?
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well
it
could
be
in
conflict
in
this
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
it
could
be
in
conflict
if
the
--
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
sense
that
the
same
fact
situation
which
form
the
basis
of
this
judgment
might
be
viewed
by
the
federal
board
in
a
different
light.
the
federal
board
might,
in
effect,
take
the
same
fact
situation,
find
that
the
alleged
course
of
conduct
and
the
part
of
the
appellant
was
not
indeed
unlawful
and
the
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
in
the
now
pending
federal
board
proceeding,
your
honor,
no
order
could
be
entered
directly
conflicting
with
the
order
here
in
review,
but
it
is
our
belief
that
the
actual
fact
of
conflict
is,
if
course,
not
necessary
to
justify
a
holding
to
the
effect
that
the
state
board
was
without
jurisdiction
because
it
--
because
it
is
the
potential
of
conflict
which
is
present
in
this
case,
which
requires
that
holding.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
may
i
point
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
may
i
point
out,
your
honor,
that
the
laburnum
case,
which
is
the
most
recent
of
the
cases
involving
violence,
was
not
an
injunction
case.
the
laburnum
case
was
a
case
involving
damages.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i
think
that
the
inference
is
quite
strong
from
the
laburnum
case,
both
from
the
majority
holding
and
from
the
dissenting
opinion
that
a
state
labor
board,
at
least,
could
not
enjoin
the
conduct
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
as
i
understand,
the
holding
in
the
laburnum
case,
it
was
that
because
the
remedy
applied
by
the
state
was
one
that
could
not
possibly
conflict
with
the
federal
remedy.
it
could
stand.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i
respectfully
beg
to
differ,
your
honor.
the
federal
board
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well
you
honor,
may
i
suggest
that
in
the
--
let
me
--may
i
suggest
in
the
laburnum
case,
the
two
remedies
were
not
the
same
and
therefore
although
it
maybe
an
interference
with
the
union,
it
would
not
be
--
it
wasn't
the
action
in
--
above
the
state
in
the
laburnum
case
was
not
an
interference
with
the
federal
board's
jurisdiction.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
it
is
my
understanding
of
these
decisions
that
there
is
an
area
of
police
power
in
the
states,
but
this
does
not
mean
that
the
states
can
exercise
that
police
power
in
any
way
they
see
fit.
and
we
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
mean
that
the
states
may
not
exercise
that
police
power
in
a
manner
that
conflicts
with
a
federal
regulatory
statute.
and,
may
i
finish
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
oh,
that
is
a
very
difficult
question.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
because
in
--
because
in
a
court
of
equity,
the
judge
would
be
applying
general
principles
applicable
to
all
situations
alike,
labor,
relation
situations,
any
other
violence
or
threat
of
violence
situation.
indeed,
it
is
very
likely
in
this
case,
if
--
if
the
kohler
company
had
sought
an
--
a
general
equity
injunction
that
they
would
not
have
gotten
it
because
the
circuit
judge
on
reviewing
the
state
board's
order
said
that
he
regret
it
that
the
state
labor
statute
made
his
powers
in
a
situation
of
this
kind
so
narrow.
he
said
that
he
would
much
rather
be
sitting
in
--
as
a
court
of
general
equity
jurisdiction
applying
general
principles
of
equity
weighing
the
respective
merits
of
the
parties'
positions
judging
whether
or
not
the
company
came
into
court
with
clean
hands.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
i
--
it
is
--
as
i
indicated
very
difficult
to
answer
in
--
in
blank
of
the
questions
concerning
what
might
happen,
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
a
master,
we
do
not
have
a
chancellor
sitting
in
equity.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
you
have,
your
honor,
a
court
decree
based
on
findings
made
by
a
specialized
labor
board
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
i
cannot
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i
find
this
difficult
to
reconcile
with
this
court's
decisions
in
garner
and
anheuser-busch.
and
incidentally,
your
honor
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
with
reference
to
the
allen-bradley
case
and
the
uaw,
afl
case
and
the
so-called
briggs
and
stratton
case,
i
believe,
those
are
the
police
cases
to
which
your
honor
had
reference.
it
may
be
that
the
court
in
those
cases
was
holding
that
the
states
police
power
was
involved,
but
i
do
not
read
those
cases
as
holding
that
that
police
power
could
be
exercised
in
any
way
the
states
saw
fit.
because
in
those
cases,
the
court
said
very
expressly
that
we
are
upholding
the
action
of
the
state
here
because
it
is
not
regulated
by
the
federal
act
either
by
prohibition
or
by
protection.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
your
honor,
may
i
point
out
that
since
the
taft-hartley
amendments,
the
national
labor
relations
board
have
the
kohler
company
seen
fit
to
take
its
case
before
them
and
file
federal
unfair
labor
practice
charges,
the
n.l.r.b.could
have
entered
almost
precisely
the
same
kind
of
order
that
the
wisconsin
board
did
here.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
your
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i
would
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
issues
involved
in
the
case,
yes.
but
may
i
point
out
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
ample
police
power
under
its
statutes
and
codes
of
general
applicability
to
regulate
violence,
threats
to
the
breach
of
the
peace
and
the
like.
the
wisconsin
has
an
ample
criminal
code
that
prohibits
crimes
against
the
person,
against
property
that
prohibits
riot
as
assemblies.
it
has
an
ample
traffic
code
that
allows
it
to
regulate
traffic
and
keep
the
streets
clear,
irrespective
of
whether
these
interferences
occur
in
a
labor
relations
context
or
elsewhere.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that,
in
fact,
wisconsin
was
not
here
proceeding
under
a
police
major
as
i
understand
the
term.
wisconsin
was
proceeding
under
what
is
called
the
employment
peace
act.
it
was
proceeding
--
which
is
found
in
turn
in
a
chapter
of
the
wisconsin
statutes
entitled
employment
relations.
the
--
the
declaration
of
policy
that
precedes
this
statute
says
that
the
--
that
the
public
policy
of
the
state
is
declared
here
as
to
employment
relations
and
collective
bargaining.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
here
was
dealing
primarily
with
the
regulation
of
labor
relations.
it
was
primarily
setting
up
the
rules
of
the
game
in
a
labor
dispute.
it
was
not
in
--
it
was
incidentally,
your
honor,
regulating
the
traffic.
it
was
incidentally,
your
honor,
protecting
the
peace.
it
was
not
primarily
--
it
was
primarily
protecting
statutory
rights
of
employees
under
a
labor
statute
very
similar
to
the
statutory
rights
of
employees
in
the
federal
labor
statutes.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
and
i
suggest
that
the
thrust
of
the
order
of
wisconsin
board
applying
this
statute
is
primarily
one
directed
towards
the
regulation
of
employment
relations,
not
directed
towards
the
protection
of
the
peace.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
this
is
appended
to
our
appendix
c,
your
honor.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
those
are
excerpts
from
pleadings.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
it
is
the
complaint
of
the
federal
board
and
an
answer
in
the
number
of
amended
answers
to
the
complaint
filed
by
the
kohler
company.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
we
filed
initially
a
so-called
unfair
labor
practice
charge
on
the
base
of
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
we
are
not
questioning
certainly
a
general
equity
injunction
based
on
general
principles
of
equity
directed,
let
us
say,
to
the
protection
of
property.
for
example,
pickets
through
bricks
at
a
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
at
a
--
briggs
through
--
through
briggs
had
a
plan
why
certainly
that
could
be
enjoined.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
that
is
right.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
that's
right.
but
we
think
that
the
state
should
apply
its
police
measures
to
labor
disputes
as
they
do
to
any
other
situation.
and
if,
on
the
other
hand,
our
conduct
is
to
be
judged
in
a
labor
relations
context
why
then
it
has
to
be
judged
before
the
central
federally
designated
tribunal
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well
i
would
think
one
would
still
have
to
look
to
the
character
of
the
statute
and
if
one
did
that,
one
would
find
that
the
statute
contains
a
provision
--
a
provision
for
example
setting
up
employee
rights
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
or
to
refrain
from
doing
so.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes
it
did,
your
honor.
i
suggest
it
is
our
position
that
the
thrust
of
the
injunction
in
this
case
is
directed
towards
the
protection
of
employee
rights
in
the
exercise
of
the
statutory
rights
under
a
--
under
the
state
labor
statute.
the
--
among
the
conclusions
of
law
of
the
wisconsin
board
is
a
--
is
a
conclusion
that
the
appellant
had
violated
a
section
of
the
wisconsin
statute
which
prohibit
--
which
makes
--
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
established
in
section
111.04.
if
one
goes
to
section
111.04,
one
finds
that
that
section
is
almost
a
verbatim
duplication
of
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
establishes
certain
employee
rights.
and
i
believe
that
the
entire
order
of
the
wisconsin
board
is
directed
towards
the
protection
of
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
statutory
rights
exactly
as
the
federal
board
would
enter
such
an
order
under
like
circumstances.
and
that
insofar
as
the
wisconsin
board
--
wisconsin
board
might
regulate
traffic
why
this
i
suggest
is
in
--
an
incident
to
the
protection
of
employee
rights
and
the
same
incident
would
flow
from
a
federal
board
order
because
the
federal
board,
under
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
statute,
has
held
all
of
the
conduct
which
the
wisconsin
board
found
to
have
taken
place
here
to
be
a
federal
unfair
labor
practice.
there
is
--
there
is
no
conduct
here
which
the
federal
board
has
not,
in
one
case
or
another,
regulated
as
a
union
unfair
labor
practice.
that
being
so,
we
believe
we
are
entitled
to
have
that
conduct
judged
by
the
federal
board
to
see
whether
in
fact
it
took
place.
now,
this
overlap
is
admitted,
at
least,
by
the
kohler
company
in
their
brief,
although,
they
do
suggest
that
the
wisconsin
board
could
or
did
do
some
things
that
the
federal
board
could
not
have
done.
but
we
believe
that
--
at
the
point
where
there
is
this
impingement
upon
the
federal
board's
jurisdiction
why
the
state
action
cannot
be
upheld.
for
example,
wisconsin
points
out
in
its
brief
that
unlike
the
federal
statute,
the
state
statute
proscribes
unfair
labor
practices
by
any
person.
the
federal
statute
proscribes
unfair
labor
practices
by
employers,
labor
unions
and
their
agents.
well
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
that
particular
section
of
the
wisconsin
statute
was
not
invoked
here.
again,
wisconsin
claims
that
the
wisconsin
statute
prohibits
individuals
and
members
of
the
union
as
well
as
labor
unions
and
their
agents.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
wisconsin
board
is
--
board's
order
is
directed
towards
two
labor
unions,
one
of
whom
is
the
appellant
here,
the
other
one
being
one
of
its
local
unions
and
to
the
agents
of
labor
unions.
i
suggest
that
the
wisconsin
had
wanted
to
avoid
conflict
with
the
--
the
federal
board,
they
might
have
limited
their
regulation
to
that
of
individuals
who
were
not
agents
of
a
labor
organization,
because
that,
the
federal
board
couldn't
regulate.
now,
with
respect
to
the
continued
validity
of
state
labor
laws
and
the
continued
jurisdiction
of
state
labor
boards,
we
think
that
the
congress
in
the
federal
labor
statute
has
spoken.
the
congress,
we
believe,
has
told
us
in
section
10
(a)
and
in
section
14
(b)
of
the
federal
act
where
and
under
what
circumstances
state
labor
boards
were
to
have
jurisdiction.
section
10
(a)
is
the
so-called
session
proviso
which
authorizes
the
federal
board
to
cede
jurisdiction
to
state
labor
boards
under
certain
circumstances.
section
14
(b)
is
the
section
of
the
statute
which
specifically
saves
the
continued
validity
of
state
regulation
of
the
union
shop.
we
think
that
those
two
sections
taken
together
represent
the
legislative
judgment
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
state
labor
boards
were
to
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
your
honor,
i
do
suggest
that
it
is
conclusive
insofar
as
the
continued
jurisdiction
of
state
labor
boards
over
federally
regulated
unfair
labor
practices
is
concerned.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
as
i
understand
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
your
honor
i
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
quite
clear
that
the
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
that
your
honor
clarify
them
extremely
well.
i
thought
in
the
anheuser-busch
case,
and
as
i
read
those
decisions,
they
do
suggest
that
the
federal
board's
jurisdiction
where
it
exist
and
we
--
it
does
exist
here.
it
undeniably
exists
here.
where
it
exists,
it
is
exclusive.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes,
the
court
indicated
that
there
was
a
penumbral
area.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
now,
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
direct
my
attention
to
some
decisions
which
the
appellees
have
relied
upon
particularly
in
support
of
their
position.
the
first
of
these
is
one
that
has
already
been
mentioned,
that
is
the
allen-bradley
case
which
is
of
particular
significance
here
because
it
involves
a
substantially
similar
order
of
the
wisconsin
board
and
it
involves
the
same
provisions
of
the
wisconsin
statute.
now,
the
court
has
--
the
court
in
the
allen-bradley
case
said
that
we
decided
this
case
this
way,
we
authorize
the
--
we
--
we
find
the
action
of
the
state
board
authorized
because
the
conduct
involved
is
not
regulated
by
the
federal
labor
act
either
by
protection
or
by
prohibition.
and
of
course,
significantly,
that
case
came
up
in
1942
and
predated
the
taft-hartley
amendments
which
added
federal
regulation
of
this
kind
of
conduct
to
the
federal
labor
statute.
and
the
court
has,
on
subsequent
occasions,
characterized
its
holding
in
the
allen-bradley
case
in
the
same
way
in
the
case
of
hill
against
florida
which
followed
very
shortly.
the
court
said
in
allen-bradley,
we
found
the
conduct
to
be
unregulated
federally
and
the
--
in
anheuser-busch,
the
court
said
about
allen-bradley,
the
court
held
that
such
conduct
was
not
subject
to
regulation
by
the
federal
board
either
by
prohibition
or
by
protection.
and
the
briggs-stratton
case,
the
famous
quickie
strike
case
stands
for
the
same
proposition.
that
case
followed
taft-hartley.
but
again,
the
holding
of
the
court
was,
that
the
conduct
involved
in
that
case
was
not
subject
to
federal
regulation.
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
it
is
said
that
the
federal
board
is
without
expressed
power
to
regulate
this
kind
of
conduct.
in
this
case,
we
say,
there
is
such
expressed
power.
we
have
already
discussed
briefly
the
laburnum
case
as
we
understand
that
decision.
and
i
--
the
case
was
characterized
in
weber-
anheuser-busch
this
way
in
laburnum
which
involved
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
federal
statute,
the
same
section
of
the
federal
statute
here
involved.
in
laburnum,
the
violent
conduct
was
reached
by
a
remedy
having
no
parallel
in
and
not
in
conflict
with
any
remedy
afforded
by
the
federal
act.
and
as
i
read
the
case,
there
seem
to
be
substantial
agreement
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
douglas.
that
while
the
state
remedy
was
being
upheld
because
it
did
not
duplicate
or
conflict
with
the
federal
remedy,
if
that
the
contrary
had
been
the
case,
a
different
result
would
have
obtained.
the
--
the
court
said
in
the
laburnum
case
to
the
extent
that
congress
prescribed
preventive
procedure
against
unfair
labor
practices.
the
garner
case
recognized
that
the
act
excluded
conflicting
state
procedure
to
the
same
end.
and
i
repeat
again,
laburnum
did
involve
violent
conduct.
and
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
his
dissent
said,
on
the
facts
found
by
the
state
court,
the
labor
organized
and
the
union
have
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
by
using
threats
and
to
force
of
the
picket
line
to
make
employees
join
the
union
contrary
to
their
desires.
a
state
court
or
a
state
labor
board
could
not
enjoin
that
conduct
as
garner
against
teamsters
teachers.
now,
mr.
justice
douglas
differed
it
from
the
conclusion
of
the
majority
that
the
state
could
superimpose
an
additional
different
remedy,
but
there
seem
to
be
substantial
agreement
that
there
could
be
--
that
there
could
be
no
duplication
of
the
federal
remedy.
one
more
case
i
should
like
to
refer
to,
it's
the
algoma
plywood
case
which
is
repeatedly
cited
by
appellees.
that
case
involved
--
in
--
in
that
case,
the
court
upheld
application
by
the
state
of
wisconsin
of
its
regulation
of
the
union
shop.
and
we
believe
the
court
did
so
for
a
very
good
and
plain
reason,
namely,
that
congress
in
section
14
(b)
of
the
statute
has
said
that
the
states
may
do
so.
in
--
the
court
in
that
case
said
section
10
(a)
of
the
federal
act
which
is
the
section
that
empowers
that
federal
board
to
regulate
unfair
labor
practices,
section
10
(a)
of
the
federal
act
was
designed
to
preclude
conflict
in
the
administration
of
remedies
for
the
practices
prescribed
by
section
8.
and
in
this
case,
we
do
have
section
8
practices.
thus,
we
believe
that
the
instant
case
involves
an
area
which
is
subject
both
to
substantive
and
to
procedural
regulation
under
the
federal
labor
act
by
the
federal
labor
board.
for
that
reason,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
states
may
regulate
the
same
conduct
in
substantially
the
same
manner.
and
i
believe
that
i
might
appropriately
close
by
referring
to
the
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
yesterday
in
the
mine
workers
case
when
he
said
that
withdrawal
of
state
power
has
been
found
to
exist
where
state
law
makes
inroads
on
the
primary
jurisdiction
which
congress
has
--
with
which
congress
has
invested
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
believe
that
the
wisconsin
board
thus
make
such
inroads
here.
indeed,
we
believe
that
the
wisconsin
board's
order
substantially
duplicates
the
kind
of
order
which
the
federal
board
might
have
entered.
and
in
consequence,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
states'
action
can
stand.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
if
the
court
please.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
counsel
for
the
kohler
company
and
counsel
for
the
wisconsin
board
have
suggested
that
the
order
in
this
case
and
the
wisconsin
statute
enable
the
wisconsin
board
to
prohibit
any
person
rather
than
an
employee
acting
individually
or
in
concert
from
committing
unfair
labor
practices.
it
is
true
that
there
is
such
a
section
in
the
wisconsin
statute.
that
is
the
wisconsin
statute
contains
prohibitions
against
employers,
prohibitions
against
employees
and
prohibitions
against
any
person.
that
section
which
contains
that
prohibition
against
any
person
is
section
111.63.
it
was
not
invoked
in
this
case.
the
wisconsin
board's
findings
are
based
on
section
111.6
(2)
which
is
the
section
that
directs
itself
towards
employees
acting
individually
and
in
concert.
and
two
of
the
respondents
in
the
wisconsin
proceeding
were
labor
organizations,
a
number
of
other
respondents
were
agents
of
labor
organizations.
and
to
that
extent
at
least,
the
wisconsin
--
the
wisconsin
regulation
duplicates
the
kind
of
regulation
which
the
federal
board
could
have
engaged
upon
in
this
case.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes,
sir.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
well,
i
believe
that
reference
to
the
appropriate
section
suggests
in
the
first
instance
what
wisconsin
in
this
case
thought
it
was
actually
doing.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
but
the
order,
your
honor,
is
directed
--
the
findings
and
the
order
are
directed
towards
labor
organizations
and
their
agents.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
it's
the
circuit
court.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i
will
merely
respond
by
noting
that
the
decree
of
the
circuit
court
too
is
directed
not
towards
any
third
person,
it
is
directed
towards
labor
organizations
and
their
agents
and
that
therefore
the
exercise
of
power
as
your
honor
puts
it
duplicates
the
kind
of
regulation
which
the
federal
board
could
engage
upon.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
i
--
i
would
say
that
this
case
does
represent
an
attempted
exercise
by
wisconsin
of
its
police
power.
but
as
i
understand
a
police
power
of
a
state,
it
is
not
an
irreducible
absolute.
it
is
not
a
power
which
--
which
can
--
any
--
any
state
regulation
that
is
legislative
for
the
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
--
public
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
certainly,
that
is
the
case.
the
kohler
company
could
have
filed
charges
substantially
similar
to
those
filed
in
the
state
complaint
before
the
federal
board
and
could
have
had
them
heard
there.
there's
no
question
that
the
federal
board
would
have
had
jurisdiction
over
them.
wisconsin
--
the
kohler
company
elected
to
take
its
complaint
before
the
wisconsin
board
and
in
that
sense,
the
--
the
kohler
company,
of
course,
is
in
the
position
of
shopping
for
its
form
which
we
are
not.
and
the
counsel
for
kohler
company
demonstrated
in
this
connection
that
the
issues
in
this
dispute
are
interrelated
because
they
are
--
have
finding
it
necessary
to
plead
some
of
the
same
things
that
were
pleaded
before
the
state
board
before
the
federal
board.
and
as
i
argued
yesterday,
we
were
unable
to
do
this.
in
other
words,
we
have
claimed
that
the
kohler
company
has
engaged
in
course
of
conduct
of
various
kinds.
we
attempted
to
defend
in
the
state
proceeding
on
that
basis.
we
were
told
by
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
and
i
read
from
its
decision
on
page
13
of
the
record,
"appellant's
brief
asserts
that
the
kohler
company
has
in
its
plant
the
supply
of
clubs,
guns
and
tear
gas
and
they
submit
that
it
is
unjust
for
the
state
agencies
to
restrain
the
actions
of
appellants
while
doing
nothing
about
that.
if
the
appellants
considered
or
do
now
consider
the
presence
of
these
munitions
wrongful
as
an
unfair
labor
practice,
they
could
and
still
can
petition
the
board
for
its
abatement."
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
could
not
do
that
because
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
the
court,
one
thing
is
quite
plain,
employer
unfair
labor
practices
subject
to
federal
regulation
as
these
would
be
are
no
longer
subject
to
state
board
regulation.
therefore,
we
were
unable
to
have
our
conduct
adjudicated
in
its
context
and
in
its
relationship
to
the
company's
conduct.
and
in
other
--
put
another
way,
the
wisconsin
board,
conceding
all
of
this
about
employer
unfair
labor
practices,
is
asserting
the
right
to
adjudicate
certain
union
unfair
labor
practices
as
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
in
isolation
in
a
vacuum
unrelated
to
the
other
conduct
in
a
complex
labor
dispute.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
the
order
of
the
board
and
of
the
court
directed
the
respondent
unions
and
others
from
forcing
and
intimidating
any
person
desiring
to
be
employed
by
the
kohler
company
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
legal
rights,
intimidating
his
family,
picketing
his
domicile
or
injuring
the
person
or
property
of
such
person
or
his
employee,
hindering
or
preventing
mass
picketing.
i
shall
not
read
the
entire
order,
i
will
merely
quite
note
that
it
seems
to
me
specious
for
the
wisconsin
board
to
claim
that
the
legal
rights
of
a
person
desiring
to
be
employed
by
the
kohler
company
are
not
substantially
identical
to
the
rights
of
an
employee
under
the
federal
statute
to
engage
in
or
refrain
from
engaging
in
concerted
activities.
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
if
the
same
conduct
were
proven
before
the
federal
board,
there
is
no
question
that
a
substantial
measure
of
it
would
be
found
to
be
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
federal
statute.
now,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
federal
board
would
necessarily
have
made
those
same
findings,
but
if
they
have
--
mr.
kurt
l.
hanslowe
yes,
indeed.
we
have
--
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
a
large
number
of
cases
where
the
--
where
the
--
the
federal
board
has
found
much
if
not
all
of
the
conduct
that
was
found
to
be
a
violation
of
the
wisconsin
statute
--
to
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute.
now,
with
respect
to
persons
desiring
to
be
employed
rather
than
employees,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
has
held
that
a
person
not
yet
employed
but
at
the
point
of
employment
enjoys
the
statutory
rights
of
employees
under
the
federal
act.
and
consequently
--
consequently,
a
person
wanting
to
be
employed
by
kohler
company,
whom
the
kohler
company
wants
to
employ,
would
be
an
employee
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
federal
statute.
now,
we
concede
that
the
federal
board
would
have
no
jurisdiction
over,
let
us
say,
customers
of
the
kohler
company
or
other
business
visitors.
and
indeed,
the
--
the
wisconsin
board's
order
may
also
be
directed
towards
the
rights
of
such
people
and
those
--
and
--
and
such
people
would
not,
of
course,
be
able
to
go
to
the
federal
board.
but
i
would
note
that
if
the
federal
board,
let
us
say,
were
to
enjoin
mass
picketing
as
they
could,
if
they
found
that
to
interfere
with
employee
rights
by
those
same
business
visitors
would
derive
precisely
the
same
benefit
from
the
federal
board
order
that
they
derive
from
the
state
board
order.
and
i
am
advised
by
my
associate
from
wisconsin
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
wisconsin
board
does
not
take
complaints
from
anyone
other
than
employers,
employees
and
labor
unions.
in
other
words,
people
engaged
in
a
labor
dispute
so
that
the
injured
third
person
couldn't
bring
his
complaint
before
the
wisconsin
board.
thank
you.
