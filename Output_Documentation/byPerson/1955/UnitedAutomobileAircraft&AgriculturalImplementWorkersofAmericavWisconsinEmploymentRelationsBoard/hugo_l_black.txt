justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
proceeding
against
the
union
or
the
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
not
--
the
pleadings
and
the
--
the
record
in
that
n.l.r.b.case
are
extremely
voluminous.
a
vast
number
of
pleadings
and
amendments
have
been
filed
in
the
federal
case.
we
have
only
added
excerpts
of
those
pleadings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
there's
no
order
of
the
board
printed,
of
course,
because
no
order
of
the
board
has
issue
with
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
intermediate
report
of
the
trial
examiner
has
been
issued,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
additional
observation
to
what
we
deem
to
be
the
essential
unfairness
of
having
this
--
these
issues
tried
simultaneously
in
effect
before
two
federal
boards.
we
sought
to
defend
in
the
state
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
certain
course
of
conduct
of
the
kohler
company.
and
indeed,
from
the
comment
of
the
circuit
judge
that
he
would
much
rather
be
sitting
in
equity,
it
appears
that
--
that
there
was
some
merit
to
our
claim,
but
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
told
us
that
this
conduct
of
the
kohler
company
could
not
be
considered
unless
we
have
filed
our
own
unfair
labor
practice
charge
against
the
kohler
company
before
the
wisconsin
board.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
be
the
position
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
that
not
two
simultaneous
unfair
labor
practices,
but
three
and
perhaps
even
more
are
inappropriate
way
of
handling
this
kind
of
a
case.
now,
one
additional
comment
ought
to
be
made
and
that
is
that
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
claiming
that
this
is
the
only
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
which
is
also
regulated
by
the
federal
act
which
the
state
board
is
free
to
deal
with
in
a
state
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
and
because
it
is
perfectly
plain
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
any
other
unfair
labor
practice
subject
to
federal
regulation
is
subject
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
board.
and
there
can,
i
respectfully
suggest,
be
no
doubt
that
the
kind
of
conduct
involved
in
this
case
is
subject
to
federal
regulation.
it
is
to
be
perfectly
plain
that
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a)
of
the
federal
statute
which
added
unfair
labor
practices
was
intended
to
bring
the
kind
of
conduct
here
involved
subject
to
the
investigative
and
regulatory
powers
of
the
federal
board.
in
other
words,
if
this
conduct
have
been
proven
before
the
federal
board,
the
federal
board
could
have
entered
virtually
the
same
kind
of
order
that
the
state
board
did.
and
may
i
suggest
that
the
federal
remedy
is
not
at
all
cumbersome
and
slow
and
ineffective,
because
the
federal
statute
contains
a
provision
authorizing
the
general
counsel
of
the
federal
board
to
secure
temporary
restraining
orders
prior
to
final
adjudication
where
he
sees
fit.
so
that
insofar
as
dealing
with
this
kind
of
situation
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
is
concerned,
the
federal
proceeding
is
speedy
and
expeditious
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
state
proceedings
were
initiated
on
april
15.
the
federal
proceeding
was
initiated
some
six
months
later
because
that
was
our
charge
against
the
company.
the
company
has
chosen
to
proceed
in
this
--
before
the
state
board
rather
than
before
the
federal
board.
i
am
correct
that
the
federal
complaint
issued
some
six
months
afterwards.
the
--
our
charge
was
filed
against
the
kohler
company
some
three
months
after
the
state
proceeding.
now,
we
are
not,
as
i
have
already
indicated,
questioning
in
this
case
the
power
of
the
state
to
regulate
or
punish
violence,
threats
of
breaches
to
the
peace
and
the
like
by
police
measures
generally
applicable
to
all
situations.
it
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
elected
not
to
appear?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
is
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
we
were
to
go
on
that,
i
should
think
it
would
be
wise
for
us
to
ask
him
for
what
he
probably
presented
their
brief
in
here
in
view
of
making
that
as
an
argument,
i
take
it.
that
would
be
better
for
us
getting
directly
from
the
board
rather
than
by
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
be
a
wise
value.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
allen-bradley
case
has
remained
in
full
force,
in
effect
comes
the
taft-hartley
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
with
respect
to
violence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
rested
on
the
idea
that
the
labor
board
at
that
time
didn't
have
such
--
certain
powers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
about
to
the
extent
that
the
taft-hartley
act
has
increased
the
powers
of
the
board?
what
do
you
say
about
the
(inaudible)
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
about
violence
and
coercion
of
where
they
have
--
where
they
have
power.
let's
--
let's
get
away
from
the
violence
and
coercion
in
a
moment,
on
the
argument
you
make.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
given
the
labor
board
greater
power
that
it
has
before
it
to
restrain
certain
conduct
has
altered
in
effect
with
the
allen-bradley
infringement
on
the
power
of
the
state
with
the
same
theory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
--
does
the
act
hasn't
--
has
been
changed
and
give
the
labor
board
power
to
restrain
that
too?
