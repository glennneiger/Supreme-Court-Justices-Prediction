claim
here
by
the
union
that

police
power?

is
there
a
claim
here
that
there
was

simply
a
subterfuge

do
you
claim
that

board,

wisconsin
board,
was
lending
itself
to
an
attempt
of
the
kohler
company
to
have
its
dispute
with
the
union
adjudicated
in
a
state
jurisdiction
rather
than
the
--
the
board?
