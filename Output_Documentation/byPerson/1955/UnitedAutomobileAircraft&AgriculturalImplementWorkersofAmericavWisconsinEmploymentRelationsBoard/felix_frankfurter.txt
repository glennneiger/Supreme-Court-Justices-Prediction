that
the

have
anything

it's

that's
all

all

justice

that
judgment
is
under
review
so
that
it
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
the
state
of
wisconsin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
terms
follow
injunctions
of
this
cease-and-desist
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
any
--
but
the
judgment
--
the
judgment
of
any
cease-and-desist
order
of
the
board
being
conflict
with
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
--
could
it
issue
any
cease-and-desist
order
which
was
in
conflict
with
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
know,
could
they
say
that
you
can
throw
a
possession
--
do
they
allow
them
to
reverse
and
intimidate,
to
threat
and
throughout
(inaudible)
is
an
old
fashioned
way
to
consider
(inaudible)
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
affirmatively
prevents
the
employer
from
not
allowing
it
to
do
these
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
extent
would
that
not
be
true
in
the
cases
which
we
have
decided
rather
than
they
reach
the
case,
larger
state
to
enjoin
by
government
to
burden
allen-bradley.
i
know
there's
an
occasion
to
facts
but
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
the
vagueness
of
those
decisions
made
for
the
(inaudible)
measure
by
the
state
they
serve.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
potential
--
they
are
not
that
potential
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
think
that
the
cases
under
the
injunction
a
matter
for
the
(inaudible)
the
state
power
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
go
down
to
have
the
much
potential
to
make
--
to
make
the
union
pay
rather
than
prohibit
it
from
duty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
hear
what
you've
just
said
and
what
i
take
from
the
record
because
the
state
--
the
federal
court
couldn't
pass
on
it
if
the
relief
that
it
has
from
here
or
given
a
relief
that
is
it
has
opposed
doing
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
not
--
it
might
not
find
the
facts
that
--
i'm
saying
that
--
that
it
cannot
make
a
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
in
both
the
union
on
this
claim
that
it
had
permitted
violence
and
that
to
enjoin
as
he
--
on
the
claim
he
is
permitted
by
--
i
do
not
understand
how
large
the
potential
interference
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
the
central
--
the
central
underlying
brief
of
those
cases
in
which
state
power
was
allowed
to
invade
that
there
is
less
than
area
of
police
to
the
state,
isn't
that
an
essential
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
actually
that
there
is
a
--
individual
police
power
in
which
it's
so
local
in
it's
incident
and
if
in
fact
overriding
concern,
i'm
not
saying
that
it
has
in
this
case,
that's
a
suggestion
to
those
(inaudible)
there
is
left
a
certain
area
of
--
what
i
call
police
for.
would
you
think
--
suppose
it
didn't
go
before
your
state
board,
because
it's
stated
in
that
injunction,
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
very
difficult?
please
tell
me
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
if
the
state
--
it
doesn't
--
giving
a
judge
with
equity
judge
the
power
in
the
first
instance,
it
all
was
present
and
should
be
referred
to
the
master,
would
that
make
any
difference?
do
you
think
it
would
make
a
difference
if
the
state
uses
--
the
state
board
takes,
the
board
is
(inaudible)
that's
what
this
amounts
to,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
a
court
decree
based
on
the
finding
about
it
at
--
they
could
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
a
special
way,
that's
for
the
discretion
of
the
state,
the
power
to
point
--
to
determine
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
it's
--
whether
it's
presented
to
a
master,
astounding
master,
a
special
master,
whatever
he
called
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
on
the
basis
of
why
do
i
call
a
police?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
this
isn't
the
only
(inaudible)
on
the
ground
that
it
does
in
conviction
the
federal
department
if
it
does
in
wisconsin
as
seen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
whole
question
is,
at
least
to
my
mind
is
whether
when
you
have
this
type
of
a
situation,
that
isn't
the
enforcement,
perhaps,
the
state
move
in
strictly
by
one
of
the
police
authority,
i'm
not
talking
about
police
force.
now,
where
does
the
police
authority
deal
with
this
narrow
aspect
of
important
impunity
within
the
state
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
(inaudible)
--
isn't
that
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
translated
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
great
--
that
is
a
great
difficulty
because
that's
the
judgment
that
on
these
facts
which
compromises
these
people
to
jail
for
violation
its
criminal
code
although
the
national
labor
relations
board
may
find
the
fact
otherwise
but
you
can't
proceed
in
this
one.
is
that
all
that
gives
you
difficulty
that
a
state
has
power
to
call
out
permission
presenting
to
the
jail
(inaudible)
civil
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
dealing
with
presence
of
violence
in
this
domain
instead
of
leaving
it
to
the
general
police
peace
legislation.
and
the
state
certainly
has
discretion
to
deal
with
abuses
and
(inaudible)
ordered
in
specialized
situations
not
having
to
(inaudible)
to
catch
all
(voice

statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
do
not
have
the
statute
as
such
before.
we
have
a
particular,
specific
provision
applying
to
a
specific
set
of
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
wouldn't
be
exclusive,
otherwise,
it
would
wipe
out
all
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
imposes
the
section
that
clearly
implies
the
decree
that
are
explicitly
exclusive
--
that
otherwise,
exclusively
would
be
within
the
federal
authority
and
not
within
this
ambiguous
area
in
which
the
fighting
--
the
legal
fighting
as
to
the
general
rule,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
for
exclusive
event,
it
wouldn't
be
having
to
trouble
with
them
having
the
various
cases
and
finish
them
on
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
must
be
--
they
must
be
much
clearer
to
the
denial
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
if
the
anheuser-busch
(inaudible)
but
the
court
decided
to
candidly
say
that
the
hearing
is
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
that
--
that's
where
the
area
is
regarding
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
totally
speaking,
what
limitation
against
the
prohibition
of
using
labor
injunction
under
the
wisconsin
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
drawing
inference
from
what
you've
said
that
no
injunction
affecting
a
labor
controversy,
which
i've
take
it
is
the
(inaudible)
can
be
entered
by
a
wisconsin
court
on
--
except
as
a
condition
upon
a
finding
by
your
labor
board
or
whatever
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
--
could
an
injunction
--
could
avail
for
an
injunction
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case
to
restrain
alleged
violent
conduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
reference
there,
the
third
party,
referred
to
of
course
is
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
non
--
of
non-union
employees
to
resort
to
the
union
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
although
you're
in
the
circle
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
this
circle
there's
got
to
be
a
relation,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
statute
doesn't
deal
with
a
--
with
a
total
outsider
who
happens
to
be
sympathizing
and
(inaudible)
would
he
come
within
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
having
specific
acts
which
were
enjoined
here,
the
actual
conduct
which
was
enjoined,
could
that
be
dealt
with
by
wisconsin
law
had
you
know
--
had
you
not
this
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
was
there
any
violence
here?
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
battery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assault
and
battery?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
haven't
got
a
statute
of
wisconsin
that
outlaws
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
there
was
--
there
were
two
types
of
conduct,
actual
ordinary
violence
plus
mass
picketing
which
is
condemned
by
your
statute
as
being
a
form
of
perjury
that
your
part
of
the
outlaw,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
such
an
assemblage
couldn't
be
dealt
with
if
it
was
an
assemblage
by
people
who
were
not
involved
in
an
industrial
controversy
or
involved
in
--
in
not
liking
some
visitor
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
would
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
lampert,
that's
a
different
question,
namely,
that's
a
question
of
choice
of
remedy
or
misconduct
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
--
may
deal
with
--
which
the
state
has
--
they're
not
here
to
pass
on
the
choice
of
remedy
to
open
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
beside
the
point
whether
it's
(inaudible)
at
one
way
or
the
other
if
the
state
has
power
to
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
completely
concrete
but
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
question
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
haven't
the
power,
then
you
haven't
got
the
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
anyhow
they're
not
here,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
will
not
argue
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
--
the
reference
with
chairman
herzog's
testimony,
mrs.
lampert?
in
the
colloquy
between
the
wisconsin
congressman
and
mr.
hartley
are
so
general
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
interesting
if
you
allow
me
to
interpolate
--
presented
to
reserve
some
state
remedy,
except
that
the
whole
problem
is
what
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
whole
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you
and
your
statement
doesn't
fall
in
justice
minton's
question.
if
the
board
found
that
this
was
lawful
conduct,
then
why
isn't
that
a
collective
activity
protected
by
section
7?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
the
injunction
following
the
determination
of
your
board
relates
only
to
conduct
to
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
deemed
to
be
lawful
and
therefore
within
the
protection
of
section
7,
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
may
be
conflict
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
mass
picketing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
wisconsin
may
have
found
there
were
200
and
the
labor
board
may
find
there
were
only
five.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
section
7
then
allows
that
certain
activity
because
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
based
from
the
original
act,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
makes
a
difference
what
specific
provision
a
state
agency
professes,
base
an
order
on
if
the
state
law
avows
from
this
other
sections
such
an
order.
i
take
it,
the
rule
of
federal
court
that
an
indictment
is
labored
by
a
particular
statute
and
it
isn't
valid
under
that
statute,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
it's
trailed
in
other
--
some
other
statute.
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
from
the
point
of
view
of
power
in
cases
here
that
exercise
of
authority
by
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
board
decided
one
section
or
another
section
if
it
has
some
power
under
some
section
to
do
what
it
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
go
to
the
decree
and
see
what
it
did,
not
worry
about
what
it
thought.
they
enjoined
certain
things
and
no
amount
of
label
or
no
amount
of
characterizations
can
make
it
more
or
less
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
have
before
me
a
judgment
(inaudible)
the
circuit
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
before
me
the
decree
of
the
circuit
court
which
is
in
--
was
affirmed
the
decree
of
the
supreme
court
that
specifically
enjoined
certain
conduct
and
why
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
the
terms
of
that
injunction
that
restrain
and
not
the
--
and
decide
where
the
flow
of
restrain,
you
restrain
a
conduct
which
is
still
there
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
restrain
and
not
bother
about
the
particular
labor
it
hasted
on
the
form.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
now.
i
follow
that.
