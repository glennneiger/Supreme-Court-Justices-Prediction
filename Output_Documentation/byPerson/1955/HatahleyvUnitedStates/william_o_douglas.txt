are
you
going
to
discuss
the
federal
range
code?
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
the
major
point
in
the
case
would
be
that
is
in
conflict
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
governing
trespassers
or
violators
in
federal

the

who
doesn't
have
a
permit
from
the
taylor
grazing

but
grazes
his
cattle

douglas
do
you
come
under
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
federal
range
code?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
could've
proceeded
under
that,
could
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
the
man
in
turning
up
his
horses
might

justice
william

douglas
i'm

i'm
(inaudible)
does
section

which
provides
for
the
--
that
(a)
provides
the
notice
to
the
alleged
violator,

then
161.11
(b)
provides
for
impoundment
under
local
law
if
there
has
been
found
to
be
a
violation
here.

(voice

justice
william
o.

you
can
under
federal

justice
william

douglas
pardon?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
the
part
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
said
--
you
said
under
federal
law
you
can't
do
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
under
this
provision
of
161.11,
you'd
end
up
impounding
under
local
law
if
you
follow
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
local
procedure.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
didn't
proceed
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
that
invokes
local
law
only
at
the
end
of
a
--
of
a
federal
procedure.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
here,
this
federal
procedure
wasn't
invoked
at
all.
