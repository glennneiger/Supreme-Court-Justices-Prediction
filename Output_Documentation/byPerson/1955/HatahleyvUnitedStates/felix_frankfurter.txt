it

you
can't

an

isn't
it?
justice
felix

what
do
you
say
to
justice
reed's
suggestion
that
this
gets
down
to
--
if
you
--
if
you
mind
your
own
analysis,
(inaudible)
the
state
law?
justice

(inaudible)
and
that
is
the
law
opposing
for
a
different
rule
there
if
does
(inaudible)
as
well
as

as
you
indicate,
then
how
can
you

they

acting

if

and
if

weren't

they
were

i'm
sure
that
the
third

hole
out

get
out

two
holes,
well,
i
get
into
asserting
on

one
or
the

two
holes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
quickly
turn
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
turn
to
the
statute
which
you
invoked,
you
can
say
yes
to
the
chief
justice's
question?
justice

suppose
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
statement
of
an
equivalent
proposition,
let
me
tell
you
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
then
tell
us
what
remains
of
the
jurisdiction
as
to
what
the
taylor
grazing
act
had
so
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow.
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
naturally
not
familiar
with
--
about
these
things,
but
if
we
accept
the
findings
that
some
were
branded,
some
of
the
brands
were
recorded,
then
i
don't
understand
your
last
statement
that
there
must
be
some
--
when
the
roundup
takes
place,
there
must
be
some
further
filing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
purpose
of
having
of
the
recording
if
that
isn't
to
give
notice
for
all
purposes
for
which
such
a
recording
should
be
normally
is
called
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
that
if
you
accept
the
finding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
was
true
here
to
some
in
all
of
that,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
you
indicated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
that's
--
as
you
--
being
asked
by
the
chief
justice
a
question,
that
doesn't
take
care
of
the
fact
that
you
shouldn't
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
marquis,
the
finding
that
certain
brands
were
recorded
is
about
as
rudimentary
and
elementary
and
simple
and
unambiguous
to
the
finding
of
fact
that
one
can
conceive.
and
therefore,
the
general
objection
to
the
inferences
drawn,
i
should
hardly
think
would
cover
such
a
finding
that
in
a
certain
place,
there's
a
piece
of
paper
or
books
in
which
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
saying
you
shouldn't
have
challenged
it,
i'm
suggesting
that
your
answer
to
justice
minton's
question,
you
attack
the
structure
of
the
conclusive
report
was
hardly
the
type
of
question
of
an
entry
in
a
book.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
mean
by
not
certainly
defined
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
important
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

get
it
approved,
then
it
does
become
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
part
of
the
settling
at
the
end
of
article
1
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
sort
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
taylor
grazing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
act,
is
there
a
general
provision
for
the
rules
and
regulations
by
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
grazing
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
is
it
your
view
that
that
single
authorization
wouldn't
enable
the
department
to
make
use
of
the
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
when
they're
branded
and
registered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
you
had
them
--
and
they
had
a
brand.
they
were
branded
and
the
court's
finding
wouldn't
have
(inaudible)
registered
for
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
some
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
don't
that
be
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
what
is
the
challenge
which
brings
out
to
sustain
your
answer
that
it
did
challenge
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
may
i
interrupt
to
say
that
the
motive
may
be
important
on
you're
a,
namely,
it's
one
thing
to
make
an
honest
mistake
as
to
state
law
and
another
case,
they
have
a
purposeful
desire
to
(inaudible)
the
right
that
are
outside
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
marquis,
on
this
latter
point
and
outside
the
scope,
it
seems
to
me
rather
vividly
(inaudible)
to
treat
it
at
the
outset,
i
mean,
the
facts
that's
laid
here.
suppose
if
the
situation
is
whether
it
is
in
utah,
these
vast
areas
with
a
vast
discretionary
authority
vested
in
the
official,
one
doesn't
look
very
sharply
and
apply
very
strictly
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
intra
or
ultra
vires
of
an
agent's
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i'm
saying
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maliciousness
maybe
excessive
deed,
wholly
excessive
deed
or
malicious
deed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
a
vast
area,
vesting
necessarily
a
large
discretion
that
the
agent
found
that
spot.
i
shouldn't
think
of
this
outside
the
scope
of
authority.
