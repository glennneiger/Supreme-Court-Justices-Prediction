that
--
that
is
not
essential
to
your
case.
chief

the
horses
were
branded?
chief
justice

warren
the
horses
were
branded?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
position
is
if
they
acted
tortuously
in
--
in
tearing
this
law
into
effect.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
did
indeed.
chief
justice
earl

is
that
right?

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
marquis,
assume
--
assuming
that
the
authorities
know
who
the
owners
of
these
animals
are
and
assuming
that
they
know
that
they
are
not
really
abandoned
animals
but
are
mere
trespassers
on
the
public
domain,
are
they
authorized
by
the
state
law
to
invoke
the
abandoned
animal
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
were
those
things
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
was
the
act
followed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
they
--
why
didn't
they
follow
the
rest
of
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
one
of
those
acts,
don't
they
make
a
distinction
between
abandoned
horses
and
trespassers
in
which
event
they
impound
the
horses
and
give
notice
and
--
and
enable
the
owners
to
get
them
back?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
to
be
used
--
isn't
that
to
be
used
in
cases
where
they
either
know
who
the
owners
are
or
have
reasonable
opportunity
to
know
who
the
owners
are?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
there
not
been
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continuous
trespassing
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
definition
in
either
the
state
or
the
federal
law
to
what
constitutes
an
abandoned
animal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
whether
these
animals
escaped
taxation
the
year
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
were
branded,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
government
took
those
along
with
the
unbranded.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
a
right
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
some
of
those
you
say
were
recorded
brands?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
those
that
were
recorded
brands,
what
is
your
position
as
to
whether
the
government
had
the
right
to
take
them
as
abandoned
animals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
do
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
from
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
oh,
pardon
me.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
these
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
--
wasn't
there
a
finding
in
this
case
that
to
the
effect
that
the
government
agents
waited
at
the
night
time
until
these
horses
were
turned
out
of
the
corrals
and
then
rounded
them
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
was
a
finding
to
that
effect,
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
now
as
to
those,
do
you
claim
that
those
are
abandoned
animals
as
distinguished
from
trespassing
animals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
the
trespass
and
the
--
and
the
abandonment
so
far
as
this
situation
is
concerned?
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
say
it's
one
and
not
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
do
you
get
that
definition,
or
those
two
definitions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
do
you
get
the
trespassing
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
it
--
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
policy
of
the
government
in
--
in
these
matters
generally
speaking,
to
consider
a
horse
that
is
corralled
normally
but
is
permitted
to
be
outside
at
night
trespassing
on
the
domain
being
it
an
abandoned
animal?
is
that
the
policy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
would
presume
it
was
not
to
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
that
--
that
was
done
here,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
i
suppose
that
the
general
policy
was
in
accordance
with
the
general
definitions,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
do
you
change
the
definition
and
the
policy
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
--
as
i
understood
you,
normally,
if
an
animal
was
a
corralled
animal
and
was
merely
let
loose
at
night
to
forage
known
to
the
government
agents,
that
that
horse
would
be
considered
a
trespasser
and
not
an
abandoned
animal.
but
in
this
case,
you
reversed
it
and
although
there
is
a
finding
in
the
case
to
the
effect
that
the
government
agents
were
there
and
watched
until
the
horses
were
permitted
to
go
outside
of
their
corrals
and
then
scooped
them
up
as
abandoned
animals.
that
they're
no
longer
to
be
considered
merely
as
trespassing
animals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
trial
court
found
that,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
find
it
on
the
--
on
the
evidence
of
your
own
government
agents?
did
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
government
agents
testified
that
there
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
they
go
farther
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
your
government
agents
admit
in
the
trial
that
they
knew
they
had
been
released
from
the
corral
that
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
may
be
mistaken.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
may
be
mistaken
to
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
testimony
in
the
record,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
this
--
is
this
the
agent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
agent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
before
you
get
to
the
--
before
you
get
to
the
title,
the
--
the
federal
range
law
requires
the
government
to
give
notice
to
the
owners
when
it
knows
who
the
owners
of
the
horses
are,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that
notice
must
be
in
writing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
give
--
did
they
give
such
notice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
procedure
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
destroying
these
animals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
the
provision
for
a
written
notice
in
the
federal
--
federal
code
to
the
owners?
chief
justice
earl
warren
52.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
is
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
was
there
a
violation
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
--
was
there
a
written
notice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
court
found
they
--
they
only
ranged
from
the
corral
to
the
truck
of
your
government
agents,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
you
dispute
this
finding
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
marquis
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
you
contend
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
the
trial
court
could
have
found
that
there
was
any
said
scheme
or
plan
or
conspiracy,
if
you
choose
to
call
it
such,
on
the
part
of
these
people
or
any
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
raise
that
then
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
littell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
