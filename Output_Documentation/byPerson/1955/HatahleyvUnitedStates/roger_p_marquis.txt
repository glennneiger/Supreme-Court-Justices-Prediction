mr.
roger
p.
marquis
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
is
two-fold.
first,
we
think
the
actions
taken
here
were
appropriate
in
enforcement
of
law
regulating
the
grazing
area
of
the
public
domain.
second,
we
think
that
assuming
that
that
is
not
so,
assuming
some
defect
is
found
in
the
procedures
or
a
mistake
as
to
the
law
applicable
that
that
cannot
be
the
basis
of
a
judgment
in
the
tort
claims
act.
i
don't
think
i
need
separately
deal
with
the
matter
of
the
injunction.
i
think
so
far
as
necessary,
that
will
come
out
in
the
course
of
my
discussion.
i
think
that
the
matter
of
damages
is
dealt
with
adequately
in
the
briefs
and
i
don't
think
that
is
necessary
to
be
dealt
upon
during
my
argument.
first
of
all,
and
i
think
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
we
were
plainly
right,
a,
in
applying
the
utah
abandoned
horse
law
to
the
taylor
grazing
act
area
and,
b,
in
the
procedures
and
so
forth
that
were
taken
under
that
act.
and
i
will
have
to
leave
to
the
briefs
on
the
record
the
dealing
with
the
details
of
that
for
the
most
part.
now
first,
and
this
is
the
matter
which
is
quite
important
in
the
administration
of
the
taylor
grazing
act.
it
is
the
question,
“did
the
taylor
grazing
act
supersede
the
state
law
and
in
particular
in
this
case,
the
state
law
as
to
abandoned
horses?”
a
three-minute
summary
of
the
situation
when
the
taylor
grazing
act
was
passed.
i
don't
think
we
need
be
reminded
the
importance
of
the
public
domain
in
the
west
to
the
livestock
and
cattle
and
sheep
industries.
in
the
state
of
utah,
for
example,
70%
of
the
land
is
still
public
domain.
and
that
70%
--
the
30%
that
is
privately
or
state
owned
is
interspersed
sections
like
school
lands,
16s
and
36s
or
the
homesteads
or
small
areas
and
the
public
domain
runs
through
the
entire
area
and
it's
a
checkerboard.
for
the
most
part,
in
this
grazing
area,
the
springs,
the
wells,
the
pass,
the
lowland
where
there's
some
cultivation,
will
be
under
a
patent
and
the
attached
grazing
area
of
wide
scope
will
be
public
domain
subject
to
grazing
licenses.
because
of
the
very
great
importance
of
the
grazing
matter
to
the
west,
special
laws
had
been
built
up
special
rules
of
law
modifying
the
common
law
as
to
trespass
and
as
to
such
matters
in
order
to
deal
with
the
situation
of
an
unfenced
area
of
public
domain
of
large
importance
to
the
local
industry.
and
of
course,
that
is
the
source
and
has
been
the
cause
of
dispute
between
cattle
men
and
sheep
men
and
had
related
in
particular
laws.
and
of
these,
the
abandoned
horse
law
deals
with
a
public
health
and
public
welfare
problem.
it's
the
problem
of
abandoned
--
is
perhaps
a
misnomer
in
our
eastern
sense
of
someone
abandoning
their
--
of
their
personal
property
like
an
automobile
or
something
like
that.
it's
a
matter
of
dealing
with
uncontrolled
animals
running
loose
on
the
unfenced
public
lands,
the
range
of
the
west.
the
problem
is
that
there
may
be
owners,
there
very
likely
is
for
all
of
them,
but
there
has
to
be
an
enforced
control
of
some
sort
dealing
with
the
circumstances.
and
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
vast
areas
in
the
small
population
and
the
policing
problem.
for
example,
san
juan
county,
utah
which
is
district
number
9
on
the
taylor
grazing
act
is
7800
square
miles,
somewhat
larger
than
the
state
of
massachusetts,
it's
one
of
the
largest
counties
in
the
country.
the
particular
area
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute
where
these
eight
indian
families
claim
the
rights
is
of
itself
760,000
acres,
larger
than
the
state
of
rhode
island.
the
population
of
san
juan
county
is
roughly
5000.
these
give
a
picture,
of
course,
their
vegetation
is
sparse
so
that
there
has
to
be
large
areas
for
grazing
and
we're
dealing
here
with
widely
dispersed
people
and
animals.
now,
this
abandoned
horse
law
and
i
might
say
that
it
is
not
peculiar
to
utah,
wyoming
and
montana,
for
example,
have
laws
that
are
identical
to
the
utah
law
on
this
subject,
set
out
a
procedure
whereby
the
menace
and
it's
a
menace
to
the
existing
animals
on
the
range,
the
menace
of
mixed
breeding
and
the
animals
running
loose
are
likely
to
be
the
lower
quality
animals
or
those
things
the
matter
of
horses
running
loose
on
the
range
is
a
menace.
it's
a
public
house
problem,
public
welfare
problem,
a
public
health
problem
to
these
areas
in
the
west
to
which
their
grazing
is
so
vital.
it's
far
beyond
simply
the
forage
that
the
horse
may
eat.
well,
that
is
a
problem
enough,
all
the
dislocations
caused
by
uncontrolled
horses.
that
is
the
particular
program
we're
dealing
with
here.
and
other
programs,
you
look
in
the
statutes
of
the
western
states,
you
look
under
livestock
or
animals,
you
will
see
a
gradient
quantity
of
legislation
dealing
with
these
problems.
now,
up
until
1934,
these
western
states
had
all
enacted
that
legislation
dealing
with
the
public
range
which
was
most
of
the
range,
and
the
matter
of
the
rights
to
graze
had
been
governed
by
custom.
no
special
federal
statute.
the
taylor
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
would
--
i
would
say,
yes,
to
your
question.
of
course,
i
--
i
don't
exactly
agree
with
the
assumptions.
but
i
would
say,
yes,
to
the
statute.
the
statute
is
dealing
with
the
abandoned
horses.
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
invoke
the
statute
which
then
simply
puts
on
the
burden
of
the
animals
the
obligation
to
file
a
description
of
their
animals
and
their
brands
and
then
there
are
measures
for
service
by
mail
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
and
so
forth.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
in
the
respondent's
--
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
at
page
58,
the
last
page
next
to
the
cover.
“any
person
owning
any
horses
which
are
running
at
large
in
any
county
in
which
the
board
of
county
commissioners
has
given
notice
of
intention
to
make
a
drive”
as
provided
in
this
chapter,
“may,
within
30
days
after
posting
or
the
first
publication
of
the
notice
mentioned
with
the
board,
file
with
the
board
of
county
commissioners
a
description
of
such
horses
claimed
by
him
giving
the
marks
and
brands,
if
any,
which
appear
thereof.
and
if
the
board
of
county
commissioners
shall
take
into
its
possession
any
horses
so-claimed,
it
shall,
by
registered
level,
address
the
owner
or
claimant
of
said
horses,
notify
them
and
so
forth.”
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
was
no
filing
of
description
or
brands
in
this
case
and
hence
there
was
no
notice
filed.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
act
was
followed
in
the
publication
of
that
there
will
be
a
roundup.
there
was
not
only
publication
in
the
newspaper,
there
was
posting
in
the
county
seat,
there
was
posting
in
five
places
outside
the
county
seat.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
because
the
rest
of
the
act
does
not
come
into
play
until
in
response
to
the
fact
that
a
roundup
is
--
occurs,
then
the
owner
files
with
the
board
his
description
of
his
horses
and
his
brands.
when
he
does
that,
then
anytime
any
of
those
animals
are
seized,
then
the
registered
mail
notice
is
given
to
the
owner.
and
that
is
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
impoundment
law
is
a
different
law
which
is
primarily
directed
at
the
herds
of
animals
rather
than
the
horses
as
such,
but
it
would
cover
horses.
in
that
instance,
it's
the
impoundment
law.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
think
that's
the
case
where
there's
been
continuing
trespassing
by
abandoned
sheep
or
abandoned
cattle,
someone
grazing
or
something
of
that
sort.
there
has
been
continuous
trespassing
and
a
problem
then
they
invoked
the
impoundment
law.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
but
--
that's
right.
and
this
impoundment
law,
the
local
impoundment
law,
had
been
invoked
by
the
white
permittees
who
were
entitled
to
own
--
to
graze
the
land.
and
as
the
record
will
show,
that
is
one
of
these
episodes
when
the
county
sheriff
was
there
enforcing
the
local
impoundment
law.
the
abandoned
horse
law
is
something
entirely
different
for
a
different
purpose.
its
purpose
is
to
rid
the
range
of
these
uncontrolled
animals
running
loose.
and
the
procedure
there
is
to
pick
up
the
animals
and
when
they
know
a
roundup
is
coming,
then
the
--
as
i
say,
the
owners
file
the
descriptions
and
the
brands.
and,
for
example,
in
this
case,
there
were
many
horses
running
loose,
there
are
as
many
as
400
horses
running
loose
on
the
range.
the
indian
horses
were
some
of
them.
it
wasn't
known
to
which
indians
they
belong
of
these
eight
families.
they
were
all
running
loose
on
the
range
and
the
notice
was
given
in
accordance
with
the
statute
that
there
would
be
a
roundup
of
the
horses.
and
as
might
be
expected
when
the
notice
was
given,
“we're
going
to
have
a
roundup,”
and
they
go
out
and
they
start
looking
at
the
range,
most
of
the
horses
had
disappeared.
i
think
that
is
perfectly
in
accord,
first,
getting
back
to
what
i
was
dealing
with,
i
think
it's
perfectly
in
accord
with
the
taylor
grazing
act
which
preserve
local
police
power
and
which
preserve
in
its
very
first
section
of
the
taylor
grazing
act.
it
said
that
the
jurisdiction
of
state
courts
--
of
states
is
not
to
be
affected
except
so
far
as
necessarily.
on
the
top
of
page
69,
at
the
end
of
section
1,
it
starts
on
the
very
bottom
of
68,
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief,
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
in
any
way
to
diminish,
restrict,
or
impair
any
right
which
is
heretofore
may
hereafter
initiated
under
existing
law
validly
affecting
the
public
lands
and
so
forth.”
and
then
it
comes
down
to
about
the
fourth
line,
“nor
as
limiting
or
restricting
the
power
or
authority
of
any
state
as
to
matters
within
its
jurisdiction.”
my
first
point
is
therefore
that
the
taylor
grazing
act
was
not
intended
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
sir?
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
i
think
i
want
first
to
say
that
it
--
i
think
that's
clear
that
the
taylor
grazing
act
was
not
intended
to
supersede
all
of
the
local
law
as
to
grazing
matters.
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
it
lets
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
think
--
again,
we
have
one
of
those
problems.
i
think
it
leaves
the
local
law
except
so
far
as
there
is
conflict.
i
think
it
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
section
represents
the
policy
and
then
there
is
the
later
section
which
is
--
we
didn't
reprint
it,
it's
in
the
petitioner's
appendix.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
at
page
--
the
petitioner's
appendix.
at
page
55,
at
the
bottom,
abandoned
horses
defined.
the
term
“abandoned
horses”
used
in
this
chapter
means
any
horse
and
other
animals
unbranded
or
if
branded,
that
has
escaped
assessment
for
taxation
for
the
year
next
preceding
the
killing
of
such
animal
as
here
and
after
provided
for
and
running
at
large
upon
the
open
range
of
this
state.
an
animal
not
bearing
a
decipherable
brand
recorded
in
the
office
of
recorder
of
marks
and
brands
shall
be
deemed
unbranded.”
it
isn't
put
on
knowledge
at
all,
it's
a
question,
i
think
it's
quite
reasonable
in
dealing
with
this
partially
settled
area.
it
puts
--
it
puts
the
burden
on
the
owner
in
this
area
where
animals
are
running
loose
to
have
his
brand
recorded
and
to
--
when
the
roundup
is
announced,
to
file
with
the
board
of
commissioners
saying,
“well,
now
this
is
my
animal.
if
you
pick
it
up,
let
me
know
about
it.”
and
then
the
statutory
process
proceeds
from
thereon.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
record
is
completely
silent
about
taxation.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
they
were
branded
--
some
of
them
were
branded.
some,
there
is
dispute.
the
government's
testimony
was
that
they
had
looked
in
the
brand
books
and
could
find
no
recorded
brands.
there
was
testimony
the
finding
is
some
of
the
brands
were
recorded.
how
many
isn't
stated.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
they're
--
they
were
grouped.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
government,
they
will,
i
think.
of
course,
it
isn't
the
brand,
it's
the
recording
of
the
brand.
it
isn't
the
brand
on
the
animal
when
you're
out
on
the
range
and
picking
up
the
horses.
it
isn't
the
brand
on
the
animal
that
makes
the
difference,
it's
the
brand
recorded
in
the
book.
and
of
course
they
have
brand
books
which
our
books
contain
the
recorded
brands
and
they
have
copies
out
on
the
range.
the
testimony
shows
the
government
agents
had
the
brand
books
with
them.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
government
agents
say
they
could
not
find
them
in
the
books.
the
indian
owners
testified
some
were
recorded.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
finding
was
some
were
recorded
brands.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
--
i
say
first,
i
think
that
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
action
under
this
statute
is
whether
a
particular
animal
was
abandoned.
i
don't
think
that
is
jurisdictional.
i
think
the
statute
places
the
obligation
on
the
owner
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
to
file
his
brand
when
the
roundup
is
announced.
that
was
not
done
here.
i
think
that
is
the
remedy
that
is
provided.
it's
the
obligation
which
they
put
on
persons
quite
reasonably
because
these
animals
are
running
loose
on
the
vast
range.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
--
not
--
but
i
think
before
the
roundup
takes
place.
i
think
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
generally
speaking,
if
it's
a
recorded
brand,
that
gives
the
notice
and
that's
your
brand
and
it
solves
any
problems
of
ownership,
for
instance,
the
record
is
prima
facie
evidence.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
accepting
the
finding,
it
was
--
as
some
were
recorded
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
which
ones
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
think
under
the
remedy,
i
think
under
the
statute,
the
remedy
provided
if
your
recorded
brand
horse
is
picked
up,
the
remedy
is
to
file
--
when
a
roundup
is
announced,
to
file
your
brand.
and
if
you
do,
then
you
do
get
notice
if
your
recorded
brand
horse
is
picked
up.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
in
the
last
part
of
the
statute
which
i
read.
that
last
page
that
if
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
section,
it's
at
the
top
of
page
58
of
petitioner's
brief
that
a
person
owning
the
horses
which
are
running
at
large
where
there's
been
notice
of
intention.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i'm
not
sure
--
they're
filed
by
counties,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
notify
the
board
of
county
commissioners,
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
after
the
general
notice
of
the
roundup.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.

from
the
statute
which
says
--
the
page
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
page
58.
that
the
person,
any
person
owning
any
horses
which
are
running
at
large
in
which
--
in
the
county
where
the
board
has
given
notice
and
intention
to
make
a
drive,
may,
within
30
days
after
posting
or
first
publication,
file
with
the
board
of
county
commissioner
a
description
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
were
none
filed
under
this
section.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right,
in
connection
with
that
section
and
of
course
we
do
challenge
the
finding.
we
say,
of
course,
that
the
general
finding
about
some
of
the
brands
being
recorded.
and
of
course
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we
say
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
our
challenge
to
the
findings
was
not
specific
as
to
each
particular
finding.
we
did
challenge
the
findings
as
a
whole
and
the
ground
on
which
inferences
were
drawn
from
the
evidence
on
the
ground
that
the
basis
of
this
alleged
conspiracy
between
the
federal
officers
and
the
local
county
sheriff
and
the
local
advisory
board
and
all
--
everyone
else
in
the
area
was
erroneous.
and
that
was
the
structure
on
which
--
or
the
inferences
and
rejection
of
evidence
was
based.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
--
of
course
there,
we
have
the
fact
that
it
runs
all
through
this
case
because
the
testimony
was
they
looked
in
the
book
and
it
wasn't
there.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
perhaps,
our
statement
of
points
on
appeal
was
not
detailed
enough.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
[laughs]
--
i
--
they
are
certainly
detailed
find
--
statement
of
points
and
we
didn't
attempt
to
go
through
all
each
individual
finding
in
each
individual
element
because
in
our
view
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
it
all
represented
a
single
--
of
course,
in
first
on
the
law,
we
think
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
secondly
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
secondly,
we
think
that
the
answer
is,
the
answer
throughout
the
case
and
the
thing
that
dispels
all
the
findings
of
that
sort
where
evidence
has
been
expressly
rejected,
the
thing
that
cuts
across
all
of
that
is
the
charge
of
the
plot
or
malicious
scheme
to
oust
these
indians
from
an
area
where
they
undoubtedly
had
rights.
that
is
the
theory
on
which
all
that
flows
throughout
the
case.
and
we
expressly
attack
that
because
of
the
fact
that
congress
had,
i
think,
quite
clearly
indicated
that
these
indians
should
remain
in
their
view
upon
the
reservation
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
as
the
state
court
held
on
this
precise
question,
that
for
at
least
three
reasons
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
indians
had
no
rights
in
this
area
to
graze,
they
were
trespassers,
that
they
be
--
these
six
families
belong
on
the
reservation
with
the
rest
of
the
indians
who
had
been
in
this
general
area.
and
as
long
as
i'm
on
that,
i'd
like
to
just
in
five
minutes
to
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
sure.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
think
there
was
a
specific
finding.
the
evidence
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
–-
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
were
no
--
there
was
no
filing
at
all
with
the
county
commissioner.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
fact
is
clear.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
after
a
roundup
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
of
--
of
horses
running
wild
has
been
announced,
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
sir.
i
will
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
well
i
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
i
propose
to
get
to
that
just
in
a
moment,
if
i
may.
i
would
like
--
well,
i
can
deal
with
that
subject
right
now,
it
follows
logically
enough.
the
point
is
--
our
point
is
that
this
abandoned
horse
law
is
not
a
trespass
law.
it
is
not
a
law
for
--
to
get
the
individual
who
has
been
trespassing
with
his
band
of
sheep
or
his
band
of
cattle,
who
has
been
running
beyond
the
area
where
he
is
permitted.
of
course,
the
taylor
grazing
act
sets
up
a
system
of
permits.
it
regularizes
the
matter
which
before
it
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
he
is
violating
the
taylor
grazing
act.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
so
--
so
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
he
is
violating
the
federal
range
act
--
the
taylor
grazing
act
and
the
regulations
set
up
a
procedure
for
giving
trespass
notices,
that's
what
they're
always
called
in
vernacular,
it's
a
trespass
notice,
for
those
that
are
grazing
their
sheep
or
cattle
either
beyond
the
period
of
their
permit
or
beyond
the
time
during
the
year
when
it's
permitted
or
too
many
sheep
or
too
many
cattle
or
many
of
those
various
reasons,
it's
almost
invariably.
some
basis
on
which
they're
on
the
range
on
the
permits
of
--
their
exceeding
a
permit
usually,
but
any
sort
of
trespass
of
the
cattle
or
the
sheep
by
an
owner
is
dealt
with
in
the
matter
of
procedure
under
the
federal
range
code
in
which
notice
is
given
and
trespass
action
is
taken
either
through
the
united
states
attorney
or
the
regulations
provide
invocation
of
local
law
of
impoundment
for
trespassers
which,
for
instance,
in
utah
law
is
covered
by
estrays.
all
of
that
we
say
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
not
on
this
abandoned
horse
--
in
our
view
of
what
the
situation
is,
that
it's
abandoned
horses.
that
procedure
is
against
named
and
known
owners.
you
--
you
name
him,
you've
been
trespassing
with
your
band
of
sheep
here
on
section
17
in
township
39,
something
of
that
sort.
this
roundup
is
a
matter
of
rounding
up
the
stray
animals
running
all
over,
the
uncontrolled
animals
on
the
public
range.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
were
400
when
we
started.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
was
one
instance.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
as
to
that
one
instance.
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we
--
in
our
version
of
facts,
we
do,
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
abandoned
animals
are
simply
running
loose
and
uncontrolled
whereas
trespass
is
a
band
under
almost
invariably
under
control
of
a
herder
of
a
band
or
may
it
could
be
a
band
of
horses
ordinarily
as
cattle
or
sheep
which
are
under
control
and
therein
a
place
where
they're
not
authorized
to
be.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
definition
of
abandoned
horse,
of
course,
i
get
from
the
utah
definition
of
the
statutory
definition.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
that's
--
that
isn't
specifically
given
in
any
--
i
don't
know
of
any
place
where
it
is
specifically
set
forth.
i
mean,
in
that
sense,
of
course,
it
is
trespass,
any
--
in
the
sense,
the
trespass
is
where
some
--
an
animal
at
a
place
where
it
shouldn't
be.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
isn't
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
know
of
any
policy
on
that
at
all,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
presume
not.
i
don't
know.
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
presume
that.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
according
to
the
findings,
of
course,
our
version
is
entirely
different.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
oh,
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
follow
you.
i
don't
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
as
i
say,
as
to
that
particular
episode,
i
don't
know
there's
any
general
policy
has
been
set
up
on
things
like
that
and
we
do
not
agree
that
that
is
what
happened.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
of
course.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
it
did.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
it
did.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
sir.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
sir.
the
government
agents
were
that
it
was
quite
--
quite
a
considerable
distance
away.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
the
government
agents
were
that
these
horses
were
quite
a
considerable
distance
away
and
could
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
could
not
be
under
the
view
of
being
within
control.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
they
weren't
simply
within
the
mediate
area
of
the
corral.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
as
to
that,
if
so
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
think
so.
no,
sir.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
but
as
to
that
particular
episode,
that
is
our
view
of
it.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
in
that
particular
episode,
i
believe
there
were
--
i
think
that
altogether,
they
were
20.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
at
page
181
is
the
testimony
of
the
indian,
of
sakezzie,
the
indian
owner.
that's
the
testimony
about
it.
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
130
--
128
it
begins,
“in
a
moonlight
night,
and
sat
up
on
the
top
of
--
above
overlooking
sakezzie's
corral
and
so
forth.”
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
this
is
the
government
agent.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
answer,
it
was
more
than
that.
on
page
128
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
of
the
record
it
begins.
it
was
more
than
that.
how
much
more?
out
on
the
mesa
on
federal
range.
you
watched
them
move
from
the
corral
out
there
where
you
picked
them
up?
i
did
not.
you
had
a
pickup
there,
didn't
you
--
a
pickup
car
there,
didn't
you?
i
was
on
alkali
point
15
or
20
miles
from
the
area
where
the
horses
were
picked
up.
were
you
the
only
man
driving
that
pickup
truck
that
night?
no.
who
else
was
driving?
bob
crum.
later
on
he
testifies
very
briefly.
didn't
you
know
they
were
coming
out
of
his
corral?
i
didn't
know
they
came
out
of
his
corral.
it
was
dark
when
he
turned
them
out.
i
can't
identify
any
of
those
horses
in
the
corral.
then
where
did
you
take
them
when
you
picked
them
up?
and
it
goes
on
from
there.
that's
the
government
agents'
evidence
on
the
subject.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
sir.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
are
115
horses
and
38
burros,
i
believe
it
is.
the
--
i
won't
go
into
the
details.
we
think
that
--
i
think
we've
pretty
well
covered
it
that
our
view
that
the
utah
abandoned
horse
law
was
properly
applied
under
the
utah
procedure
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
--
i
think
so.
i
think
it
depends
on
a
degree
of
how
close
or
how
far
they
were
in
all
said
circumstances
as
that,
i
wouldn't
suppose.
that,
of
course,
is
simply
one
instance.
i
--
i
would
like
to
deal
very
briefly
with
this
matter
of
the
title.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
to
the
name
--
to
named
owners,
when
he
knows
that.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
not
as
to
these
--
at
this
time,
no,
sir.
of
course,
the
--
as
to
trespass,
as
the
government's
position
that
the
--
these
eight
families
has
no
right
on
the
land,
on
this
range,
that
had
been
given
earlier
in
connection
with
the
hosteen
case
which
have
been
brought
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
which
had
been
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
procedure
and
our
view
is
that
that
simply
does
not
apply
to
the
abandoned
horse
roundup
procedure
which
has
been
used
several
times
in
utah
in
the
grazing
districts
and
have
been
in
the
administrative
view.
but
that
is
the
proper
way
to
get
rid
of
the
animals.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
there's
some
testimony
here
on
the
part
of
the
operative
decision
that
invoked
it
now,
was
by
mr.
kinneman
who
is
the
range
manager
in
this
area.
it
was
done
with
the
knowledge
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
in
the
particular
area
and
it
was
done
with
knowledge
of
his
superior
as
to
enforcement
of
it's
--
by
--
the
overall
operator
is
the
immediate
superior
of
kinneman,
the
range
manager
of
this
district
and
the
adjoining
district.
his
superior
by
name
of
newman
is
the
general
area
--
of
the
grazing
area
had
agreed
to
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
shows
that
they
had
invoked
it
in
the
past
and
that
he
agreed
to
invoke
it
this
time.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
was
instructed
to
invoke
the
abandoned
horse
law
of
utah
in
this
grazing
district.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
i
am.
i
would
like
to
come
to
that
right
now
in
response
to
your
honors'
question.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
they
were
corralled.
the
--
for
approximately
two
weeks,
i
believe
that
some
of
those
were
sold
to
local
operators
the
--
generally
speaking.
and
of
course,
this
process
went
on
from
september
19
until
the
following
february.
it
wasn't
an
instantaneous
process
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
we
think
of
roundup.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
these
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
believe
any
of
this
particular
group
was
shot
because
of
--
the
ones
that
were
shot
were
on
the
range
and
being
transported
and
primarily
they
were
--
that
occurred
in
february.
i
don't
believe
any
of
this
particular
group
were
shot
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
on
the
range.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
they
were
taken
to
a
corral.
they
stayed
there
for
about
two
weeks.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
government
agents.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
in
the
corral.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
then
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
remember
these
particular
ones.
some
of
them
were
sold.
a
great
many
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
of
them
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
this
abandoned
horse
law
of
utah.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
on
the
public
lands.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no.
some
of
them
were
sold
of
the
group
and
i
don't
--
as
i
say,
i
don't
remember
which
precisely
was
done
with
these
particular
ones.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
entire
procedure
was
under
the
state
law.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
the
--
that's
the
procedure
for
--
under
the
abandoned
horse
law.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
they
were
going
out
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
and
conducting
a
roundup
under
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
the
abandoned
--
abandoned
horse
law.
that's
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no.
the
federal
law
has
no
similar
procedure.
the
federal
law
is
a
trespass
law.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
no,
i
don't
think
the
federal
law
provides
for
anything
except
trespass
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
notices
and
then
a
trespass
--
then
a
lawsuit.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
--
the
federal
law
has
no
expressed
provision
for
impoundment
of
the
animals.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
does
not
provide
for
seizure
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
or
impoundment.
the
federal
law
does
not
provide
for
seizure
or
impoundment
except
that
the
secretary's
regulations
do
expressly
provide
that
local
impoundment
law
may
be
followed
or
an
action
brought
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
the
abandoned
horse
law,
that
that
was
the
procedure
to
follow
and
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
as
to
these
--
as
to
animals
or
disposing
of
animals,
that's
right.
there's
no
federal
procedure.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there's
no
--
there's
no
federal
procedure
at
all
except
the
lawsuit
against
the
individual
owner.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
is
nothing
for
impoundment
or
seizure
of
the
animals
that
are
doing
the
trespassing.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
think
that,
of
course,
the
legislative
history
is
sound.
my
view
is
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
that
sort
of
thing
was
left
to
the
states
and
it
--
has
existent
before
the
taylor
grazing
act
was
passed.
and
that
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
not
intended
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
to
be
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes.
there
is
a
usual
provision
--
that
the
rule
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
the
secretary
may
make
rules
and
regulations
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
he
has
in
his
regulation
what
he
has
done
and
i
think
perfectly
properly.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
--
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
owner
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
is
the
secretary's
regulation.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
secretary's
regulation
refers
to
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
local
law.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right,
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
as
i
say
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that
--
that's
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
that's
the
point
i
was
getting
at.
the
claim
here
is
that
that
part
of
the
statute,
that
part
of
the
regulation
is
invalid
because
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
because
federal
law
occupies
the
whole
field.
my
answer
is
that
that
regulation
is
valid
in
incorporating
that
local
impoundment
law
as
the
procedure.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
and
my
view
is
that
that
particular
--
it
shows
that
the
federal
statute
didn't
occupy
the
complete
field.
that
it's
still
left
operative,
this
particular
abandoned
horse
rule.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it's
in
--
first
of
all,
in
this
taylor
grazing
act
itself,
and
that's
on
page
52
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
of
the
petitioner's
appendix.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
general
provision,
any
local
violation
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
or
of
such
rules
and
regulations
thereunder,
after
actual
notice
thereof
shall
be
punishable
by
a
fine
of
not
more
than
$500.
that's
the
statute.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
then
on
page
54,
this
is
the
secretary's
regulations
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
which
it
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
whenever
it
appears
that
there
has
been
any
willful
violation,
the
range
manager
will
cause
the
alleged
violator
and
then
the
interest
of
landholder
who
has
filed
notice
of
his
land
to
be
served
with
a
written
notice
which
will
set
forth
the
act
or
acts
constituting
such
violation
and
so
forth.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
there
--
as
--
yes,
i
would
think
there's
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
also
a
violation.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
not
at
this
instance,
no,
sir.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
because
in
our
view,
it's
impossible
to
give
written
notice
of
an
abandoned
horse
situation.
and
that
in
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
because
they're
running
uncontrolled
on
the
range.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
some
of
them
were
recorded.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
the
most
we
--
the
most
we
know
is
it
simply
belonged
to
one
of
the
seven
families
of
indians.
they
were
indian
horses
ranging
over
this
vast
area
of
700,000
acres.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
some
were
in
various
places
over.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
these
were
various
spots
located
throughout
these
vast
area
of
the
--
of
this
range.
that
particular
episode
was
in
one
place
and
the
other
instances
were
other
areas
throughout
this
vast
area.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
and
i
don't
know
how
you
could
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
that
was
their
story.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
the
version
which
we
have
is
entirely
different.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
there
was
some
evidence
of
that
version.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
not
in
terms
of
this
direct
finding.
no,
sir.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we
--
our
--
our
view
is
that
the
situation,
the
conduct
of
the
case
and
in
view
of
all
the
evidence.
the
view
taken
is
so
founded
throughout
the
case
upon
this
notion
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
and
that
that
is
the
ground
on
which
so
much
evidence
is
rejected
and
put
out
of
mind.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
throughout
the
case,
there
is
this
reference,
the
plot,
the
plan
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
a,
the
federal
officers,
range
officers
in
the
area.
b,
actors
in
this
--
in
some
of
the
episodes
here
were
the
sheriff
and
deputy
sheriff
of
san
juan
county,
utah.
c,
the
board
of
commissioners
of
san
juan
county,
utah,
two
of
them
testified
and
the
secretary
of
the
board
testified
and
their
testimony
was
rejected
in
part
on
the
ground
that
it
was
all
part
of
this
conspiracy.
next,
the
advisory
board
under
the
taylor
grazing
act,
which
provides
for
a
local
advisory
board
to
advise
the
local
managers
on
operation
and
enforcement
of
the
taylor
grazing
act.
and
finally,
the
white
grazers
who
had
permits
to
operate
on
this
land
and
had
been
the
plaintiffs
in
the
state
court
circuit.
we
say
the
answer
--
and
that
flows
through
the
entire
picture
of
the
case
that
you
can
pick
out
and
view
one
or
the
other
of
these
matters
because
of
the
view
of
the
--
that
that
exist
--
that
plot
or
scheme
was
existed.
and
we
say
that
is
simply
not
so
because
of
one
primary
fact.
the
assumption
of
all
that
matter
of
plot
or
conspiracy
is
that
the
federal
officers
and
the
local
officers
were
attempting
to
oust
these
indians
from
the
area
without
giving
them
a
chance
to
litigate
their
alleged
rights.
now,
the
fact
is
that
i
think
the
statute,
it's
very
unusual,
congress
had
said
in
creating
the
extension
of
the
reservation
right
next
door
to
this
area
and
most
of
the
indians
had
moved
into
the
aneth
extension
in
1933
when
it
was
created.
congress
had
gone
to
unusual
lengths
in
saying
that
there
shall
not
be
lapping
over
on
to
adjacent
area.
and
it
had
said
that
con
--
it
had
provided
contrary
to
usual
law
that
no
further
allotments
to
lands
to
indians
on
the
public
domain
shall
be
made
in
san
juan
county,
utah.
and
it
had
provided
that
the
indian
homestead
act
of
1884
which
gives
indians
a
right
to
obtain
homesteads
without
charge
on
public
domain
should
not
apply
to
san
juan
county,
utah.
that
it
--
very
clearly
limited
the
indian,
the
navajo
indians
to
the
aneth
extension
and
to
the
navajo
reservation,
that
that
is
the
view
that
has
been
taken
throughout
by
the
government,
that
that
was
expressly
passed
on
by
the
local
county
court
of
san
juan
county
and
then
the
state
court
--
supreme
court
of
san
juan
county,
utah
in
a
decision
that
is
clearly
correct
and
that
the
fallacy
all
the
way
through
here
is
simply
ignoring
the
existence
of
that
fact.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
but
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
certainly
affirmably
say
there
was
--
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
plot
because
it
couldn't
have
existed.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
we
did
precisely
raise
that.
and
that's
our
view
which
was
--
it
so
undercut
all
the
findings
that
it
was
inappropriate
to
go
into
details.
i
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i'm
--
at
page
3
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
at
page
3
of
the
record,
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
number
14
as
to
conduct
of
trial
and
damages.
this
is
all
under
the
heading,
the
court
--
district
court
erred.
“in
finding,
without
basis
in
the
evidence
or
reasonable
inference
from
the
evidence,
that
it
was
the
motive
of
the
agents
and
employees
of
the
united
states
both
alone
and
in
concert
with
white
livestock
operators
to
harass
and
molest
the
indians
and
to
kill
their
animals
so
that
they
would
be
compelled
to
leave
the
range
and
could
no
longer
assert
a
right
to
use
the
area
in
question.”
that
question
was
precisely
raised.
the
court
of
appeals
like
--
found
it
unnecessary
to
go
into
it
because
the
basic
findings,
the
basic
facts
are
there.
we
think
it
perfectly
clear
and
up
until
now,
i
should
say
this,
at
page
84
of
the
record,
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial,
i
think
it
shows
what's
happened.
and
in
their
reply
brief,
the
petitioners
in
this
court
quote
certain
excerpts
along
with
that
part,
but
the
very
--
those
two
sentences
that
they
leave
out
where
the
court
is
talking
about
alleged
violation
of
its
order
and
it's
going
to
issue
a
temporary
restraining
order,
he's
talking
about
injunction.
mr.
thomas,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
i
wonder
if
it
not
might
been
--
it
might
not
be
my
duty
at
this
time
to
call
attention
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
utah.
the
agent
had
previously
said,
“well,
i
thought
i
knew
the
status,
i
was
relying
on
that
case.”
of
course,
the
case
had
been
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
utah.
it
held
that
these
indians
were
trespassers.
the
fact
is
that
one
of
these
episodes
which
is
described
in
the
finding,
the
episode
of
the
handcuffing
of
the
indian
women,
the
finding
doesn't
mention
it.
the
man
who
put
the
handcuffs
on
was
the
local
county
sheriff
of
san
juan
county,
utah
acting
under
the
state
impoundment
law.
we
say
that
that
is
typical
of
this
whole
case
that
the
fact
is
that
as
congress
had
made
so
clear
and
as
the
supreme
court
of
utah
had
held
expressly
dealing
with
these
subjects
that
the
indians
were
not
entitled,
this
group
of
six
families
were
not
entitled
to
graze
upon
this
area
that
they
were
obliged,
they
should
go
to
the
reservation
and
remain
there.
that
the
issuance
of
licenses
on
the
taylor
grazing
act
to
the
white
grazers
was
perfectly
valid
and
that
they
had
the
rights
in
the
area.
and
up
till
now
until
yesterday
in
the
argument
where
it
was
said
the
decision
was
wrong,
throughout
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
district
court,
throughout
the
briefs
in
this
court,
there
has
never
been
any
indication
of
what
is
the
answer
to
that
state
court
proceeding
which
had
been
the
supreme
court
of
utah
had
decided
this
case
and
held
the
indians
had
the
right
prior
to
any
of
these
events
in
may
of
1952
and
these
were
events
occurred
along
in
the
summer
of
1952.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
--
i
think
if
the
abandoned
horse
law
does
not
apply,
then
we
are
faced
with
the
tort
claims
problem.
is
it
within
--
is
a,
let
us
say,
the
--
i
think
there's
three
situations.
a
--
a
decision
was
that
erroneous,
that
utah
law
applied
in
all,
whereas
the
taylor
grazing
act,
that
it
imply
--
apply
to
the
entire
field.
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
clearly
if
that
is
the
ground,
it's
the
wrong,
the
tort
that
occurred,
that
is
within
--
is
at
that
level,
it's
a
decision
of
what
rule
applies
and
is
within
the
scope
of
the
discretionary
function,
et
cetera.
if
it's
a
matter
of
the
details
of
application
of
the
utah
law,
if
a
mistake
or
wrong
was
committed
there
some
place,
it
seems
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i
--
that
--
that
is
the
ground
and
also
credibility
is
the
ground
on
which
it
got
into
this
case,
i
think,
this
title
issue.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
you're
faced
with
two
things
then.
either
you're
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
government
official
which
is
not
--
certainly
it's
not
within
the
expectable
range
of
employment
to
engage
in
a
conspiracy
of
that
sort.
and
also,
it
seems
to
me
you're
within
the
scope
of
the
--
the
settled
common
law
before
the
tort
claims
act
was
ever
passed,
that
there
is
no
liability
for
performance
of
enforcement
duty
such
as
malicious
prosecution
and
that
sort
of
thing
within
the
scope
of
office
even
though
it's
charged
to
have
been
done
maliciously
against
the
plaintiff.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
think
there,
what
i
was
particularly
addressing
myself
to
was
the
matter
of
maliciousness
--
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
--
and
conspiracy
of
an
entire
group.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
well,
i
don't
understand
that
that
under
the
settled
tort
law,
similar
to
the
intentional
torts
of
assault
and
battery
and
so
forth,
that
that's
within
the
scope
of
the
tort
claim's
liability.
mr.
roger
p.
marquis
i'd
--
i
failed
to
see
if
it's
by
trial.
the
problem
is
how
is
it
within
the
scope
of
authority
and
yet
still
being
a
wrongful
act?
i
mean,
rather
than
simply
a
mistake
as
to
what
their
authority
should
be.
i
think
that's
our
problem
and
i
suggest
that
there
--
the
dilemma
i
think
is
conversely
illustrated
by
this
injunction
here
where
it's
said
to
be
justified,
and
of
course,
you
can't
justify
it
as
an
injunction
against
the
united
states,
but
is
thought
to
be
justified
on
the
ground
of
an
injunction
against
government
officers
which
could
only
be
if
they
were
acting
outside
the
scope
of
their
duties.
in
which
case,
they
would
--
certainly
it
seems
to
me
the
outside
of
the
scope
of
their
duties
for
tort
liability.
i
thank
you.
