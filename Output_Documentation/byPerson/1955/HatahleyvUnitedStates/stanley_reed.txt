do
we
--
do
we
have
here
any
problem
as
to
the
right
of
the
indian
that
graze
their
horses
on
this
land?
or
is
it
merely
the
method
by
which
they
were
--
they
can
offer?
justice
stanley
reed
oh,
we
--
we
have
nothing
to
--
we've
brought
nothing
here
in
relating
to
the
rights
of
grazing.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
--
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
whether
you're
taking
the
position
that
the
--
the
indians
have
the
right
to
graze
their
horses
here.
justice
stanley
reed
and
do
we
have
to
decide
that
question?
justice
stanley
reed
i
thought
these
people
have
been
denied
the
permits.
justice
stanley
reed
is
that
the
condition
we're
dealing
with?
justice
stanley
reed
not
to
permit
those.
justice
stanley
reed
these
are
alleged
trespassers.
justice
stanley
reed
--
taylor
grazing
act
provide
for
alleged
violator?
justice
stanley
reed
or
such
a
type
of
law
does
incorporate
state
law
in
this.
justice
stanley
reed
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
stanley
reed
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that
--
that
means
they
were
acting
completely
outside
the
law
and
beyond
their
authority.
justice
stanley
reed
no,
i
mean
--
i
mean,
when
they
--
when
they
were
slaughtering
these
animals,
they
were
acting
outside
the
law.
justice
stanley
reed
but
--
but
you
say
they
had
no
legal
right
to
use
that.
justice
stanley
reed
well
then
--
then
they
did
act
without
any
legal
authority
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
stanley
reed
mistake
in
interpretation
of
the
law.
justice
stanley
reed
how
--
how
are
the
brands
filed,
by
counties
or
by
the
state?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
if
--
if
they're
filed
--
is
what
you're
saying
that
when
a
notice
of
a
roundup
is
given
of
horses
running
loose,
that
then
they
must
re-file
their
brand
some
place?
justice
stanley
reed
you
mean
after
that
--
after
the
notice
that
they're
going
to
have
a
roundup?
justice
stanley
reed
even
though
they
had
already
been
filed
in
the
county?
justice
stanley
reed
and
--
and
where
do
you
--
what
do
you
draw
of
that?
justice
stanley
reed
i'm
looking
at
page
58.
justice
stanley
reed
and
how
does
the
--
does
the
filing
--
the
finding
show
that
they
were
--
some
brands
filed?
justice
stanley
reed
and
therefore,
your
position
is
that
none
of
the
horses
which
were
picked
up
were
branded
and
filed
in
accordance
with
this
section
47-2
in
this
case?
justice
stanley
reed
this
is
--
this
is
a
161
level,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
stanley
reed
who
--
who
made
the
determination
to
use
the
abandoned
horse
plan?
justice
stanley
reed
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
stanley
reed
is
he
the
--
the
highest
authority
in
the
operation
of
this
range?
justice
stanley
reed
in
the
area?
justice
stanley
reed
now,
do
--
does
the
record
show
directions
to
proceed
under
this
abandoned
horse?
justice
stanley
reed
and
that
this
--
this
man
in
charge
of
the
roundup
was
instructed
to
proceed
in
that
way?
justice
stanley
reed
are
you
going
to
discuss
whether
or
not
that
creates
a
liability
assuming
that
they
improperly
invoked
it?
justice
stanley
reed
supposed
it
--
suppose
you
assume
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
oust
the
indians
and
to
get
the
conspiracy
charge
to
oust
the
indians
to
get
the
range.
was
that
within
the
scope
of
the
employment
of
the
government
officials?
