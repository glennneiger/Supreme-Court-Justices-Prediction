mr.
norman
m.
littell
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
case
arising
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
it
meets
with
the
convenience
of
the
court.
i
think
it
can
best
be
presented
by
a
summary
of
the
facts,
which
will
necessarily
involve
a
review
of
the
court
proceedings
in
view
of
the
rather
extraordinary
attack
which
the
government
counsel
makes
upon
the
prejudice
of
the
trial
judge,
in
fact,
upon
his
integrity
and
then
a
statement
of
the
issues,
as
we
conceive
them
to
be
in
our
position
in
respect
to
those
issues
and
lastly,
our
argument
abandoning
rather
wide
areas
to
the
briefs
of
necessity.
this
case
will
determine
whether
in
the
face
of
the
tort
claims
act,
the
united
states,
acting
through
agents
whose
authority
to
act
and
perform
the
deeds
complained
of
in
this
case
are
admitted
--
is
admitted,
may,
with
impunity,
destroy
the
personal
property
of
indian
wards
of
the
united
states
government.
now,
wholly
without
reference
for
the
moment
to
the
legal
context
in
which
these
facts
stand,
they
reveal
what
to
any
reasonable
mind
must
be
recognized
as
a
shocking
depredation.
these
petitioners,
members
of
some
eight
navajo
indian
families,
lived
outside
the
navajo
reservation
in
southeastern
utah,
north
of
the
san
juan
river
where
they
have
their
hogans.
they
own
some
154
horses
and
burros.
that
portion
of
the
public
domain
on
which
these
petitioners
graze
their
small
amount
of
livestock
was
also
one
to
permit
to
white
livestock
men
for
about
38,000
cattle
and
sheep.
i
should
say
that
these
navajos
had
lived
there,
the
words
of
art,
the
customary
expression
is
some
time
immemorial,
i
mean,
that
they
had
lived
there
and
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
before
them
as
far
back
as
we
--
as
we
know.
after
the
taylor
grazing
act
came
into
effect
in
1934,
these
white
stockmen,
of
course,
under
the
usual
pressures
of
the
frontier
situation,
cast
somewhat
desires
--
desiring
eyes
upon
the
grazing
area
which
for
so
long
had
been
used
by
the
navajo
indians.
but
these
indians
themselves
were
bona
fide
holders
of
an
interest
there,
residents
under
the
taylor
grazing
act,
bona
fide
residents
under
the
taylor
grazing
act,
and
were
so
recognized
by
the
bureau
of
management
up
to
1947
for
and
up
through
that
year,
they
held
permits
to
graze
stock
in
this
area.
the
white
stockmen
maintained
constant
pressure
to
take
--
take
the
reins
from
the
indians.
although,
at
first,
the
indians
were
given
permits,
as
i
say,
they
were
canceled
in
1947,
various
methods
were
used
to
remove
the
indian
from
the
range,
but
the
purposes
of
this
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
of
course,
we
stick
right
to
the
record
and
these
may
be
summarized
as
follows
-
in
1950,
in
february
of
1950,
the
united
states
government
moved
into
the
district
court
of
utah
and
asked
for
an
injunction
against
hosteen
sakezzie,
one
of
the
defendants
--
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here,
and
(inaudible)
for
the
navajos
who
inhabited
that
area,
to
compel
their
removal
and
removal
of
their
stock.
and
the
district
court
held
they
had
no
power
to
give
these
indians
any
land.
he
recognized
their
--
what
we
call
aboriginal
position
there.
he
had
no
power
and
that
was
an
administrative
problem
for
the
department
of
the
interior
to
find
lands
for
them
to
go.
but
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
in
august
of
1951
reversed
him
and
said,
“it's
incumbent
upon
the
court
to
hear
this
case
on
the
merits
and
make
an
order,
irrespective
of
whether
their
lands,
other
lands,
any
lands
to
place
these
indians
upon.”
then,
there
was
a
third
case
and
this
was
a
case
brought
by
the
white
stockmen
themselves
in
a
perhaps
somewhat
more
comfortable,
state
court
of
utah.
and
these
men,
including
one
of
the
principal
witnesses
here,
(inaudible),
brought
an
action
to
the
state
court
against
a
group
of
navajos
including
some
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
and
that
court
entered
an
injunction
against
the
petitioners
for
grazing
their
stock
on
the
public
domain
in
this
area.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
utah
sustained
that
decision,
and
the
right
to
an
injunction
against
these
indian
defendants
on
the
theory
and
when
the
treaty
of
1868
was
signed
by
the
earlier
navajo
chieftains
who
--
or
that
portion
of
them
who
are
in
captivity
at
port
sumner,
they
created
the
navajo
reservation
and
the
navajos
were
required
to
return
to
it.
without
going
into
that
very
tempting
point,
let
me
say
in
passing
that
we
regard
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
utah
to
be
wholly
erroneous.
the
united
states
was
not
a
part
of
that
case.
the
united
states
was
the
landlord.
the
united
states
alone
had
the
power
to
control
the
public
lands.
when
the
federal
question
does
arise
in
the
federal
--
federal
court
that's
within
our
opinion
be
differently
decided
and
was
decided
in
the
utah
case.
but
so
much
in
passing,
they
had
an
injunction
from
the
state
court,
confirmed
with
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah.
now,
while
the
proceedings,
which
i
first
mentioned,
sent
back
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
were
pending
in
the
federal
court
against
these
indians.
kinnaman,
the
range
manager
of
the
bureau
of
land
management,
took
matters
into
his
own
hands
and
proceeded
to
eliminate
the
stock
of
the
petitioners
from
the
range.
after
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
and
as
i
say,
while
this
federal
court
case
was
still
pending
because
it
was
not
dismissed
until
june
the
27th,
1953,
he
commenced
the
horse
slaughter
program.
as
i
should
point
out
presently,
after
the
program
was
completed
and
these
horses
had
been
completely
killed,
united
states
came
into
judge
ritter's
court
in
utah
in
--
in
the
--
in
salt
lake
in
--at
--
in
utah,
advised
the
court
that
the
defendants
had
left.
they
had
removed
themselves
to
the
reservation.
there
were
no
longer
any
trespassers.
the
case
was
moot
and
it
could
be
dismissed.
and
on
those
grounds
recited
in
his
order
of
dismissal,
the
case
was
dismissed.
they
did
not
tell
the
court
that
they
had
slaughtered
the
stock
of
these
people.
on
this
basis,
judge
ritter
dismissed
the
case.
now,
i
want
to
tell
you
about
the
horse
slaughter
program
and
how
it
was
done
by
kinnaman
and
the
other
agents
of
bureau
of
land
management.
the
facts
make
it
perfectly
clear
and
i
state
here
categorically
with
a
firmed
belief
that
you
will
go
along
with
me
before
the
--
you
finish
consideration
of
this
case.
the
facts
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
object
was
to
drive
these
people
off
the
range.
all
these
men,
(inaudible),
the
stockmen,
every
person
that
knows
that
local
environment,
knows
these
indians
cannot
live
without
these
animals.
the
navajo
horses
are
an
integral
part
of
the
navajo
way
of
life.
it's
a
part
of
their
religion.
it's
a
part
of
their
death
ceremonial.
they
used
the
horses
for
every
conceivable
purpose,
their
means
of
carrying
wood
and
water
and
provisions
from
distances
which
we
city
people
would
find
quite
remote
for
our
shopping.
in
times
of
great
need
and
crisis,
they've
even
used
them
as
a
reserve
food
supply.
they're
used
in
tending
the
navajo
sheep,
in
carrying
the
sick
and
aged
and
in
carrying
the
children
and
so
too
are
the
burros.
both
of
which,
the
horses
and
the
burros
know
navajo
demands
and
are
trained,
as
i
should
point
out
from
our
particular
purposes
later
or
the
navajo
purposes.
for
these
and
other
reasons,
the
bureau
of
land
management
agents
knew
that
the
program
would
remove
the
horses
and
the
burros
that
ultimately
get
the
indian.
now,
they
proceeded
under
the
utah
--
under
the
utah
law,
the
--
called
the
abandoned
horse
statute.
actually,
there
are
two
statutes
in
utah
bearing
upon
this
subject.
the
abandoned
horse
statute,
the
--
the
first
statute
is
the
--
is
the
one
that
calls
--
comes
under
the
agricultural
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
utah
law
and
deals
with
the
impoundment
--
and
deals
with
impoundment.
without
going
into
this
at
any
great
length
at
this
moment,
the
language
becomes
important
in
our
argument,
but
i
--
i
point
out
that
there
are
two
separate
titles
and
two
separate
provisions
of
the
utah
law,
one,
the
abandoned
horse
statute,
which
is
a
nuisance
statute
permitting
peremptory
rounding
up
and
slaughter
with
only
public
--
publication
of
notice
and
posting
notes.
and
the
other
is
a
statute
which
requires
a
reasonable
search
to
ascertain
the
owners
after
which
the
animals
were
impounded
and
can
be
sold
or
otherwise
disposed
of.
this
revoked
the
--
the
abandoned
horse
statute
is
really
a
wild
--
a
wild
horse
statute
to
rid
the
range
of
animals
which
may
be
or
are
a
menace,
although
the
legislative
history
is
barren
as
strictly
the
case
in
--
in
some
of
these
early
proceedings
or
these
proceedings
in
the
western
states.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it's
the
latter.
it's
irrespective
of
the
right
of
the
indians.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
counsel
for
the
government
relies
heavily
upon
the
fact
that
these
people
are
trespassers
as
he
calls
them.
and
therefore,
i
must
lay
this
foundation,
your
honor,
to
show
what
their
true
status
is
even
though
we
contend,
i
don't
care
what
their
legal
status
is.
the
government
cannot
destroy
the
personal
property
of
these
citizens
in
this
manner
or
in
any
manner,
without
standing
--
without
standing
the
loss
and
it
can't
--
it
shouldn't
do
it
anyway.
it's
an
--
it's
the
unmoral,
unconscionable
act
that
i
think
that
that
point
that
your
honor
raises
will
inevitably
inject
itself
into
the
case.
i
mean,
counsel
makes
much
of
it.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
do
indeed.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it
is
not
essential
to
my
case.
it's
not
essential
to
my
case.
it's
the
ultimate
fact,
however,
that
--
that's
--
it
looks
behind
the
scene
of
this
--
of
this
case.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
you
do
not
have
to
decide.
title
is
not
an
issue
in
this
tort
claims
case.
it's
quite
clear.
counsel
makes
much
of
it
by
way
of
justification
of
what
was
done
here,
and
we
come
back
to
these
facts
with
the
--
of
course,
the
animals
were
killed.
they
have
to
bring
them
under
the
nuisance
statute.
they
have
to
bring
them
under
the
abandoned
horse
statute
to
get
rid
of
them.
it
all
points
up
to
what
i
said
in
the
first
instance
that
they're
interested
in
getting
the
indians
off
the
range
and
not
the
horses.
they're
seeking
to
drive
the
indians
off.
now,
by
which
steps
did
they
do
this
as
quickly
as
possible?
they
did
not
proceed
under
the
impoundment
laws.
they
proceeded
under
the
nuisance
laws.
and
there
was
a
very
little
procedure
at
that.
we
quickly
summarize
at
this.
that
is
a
proceeding
whereby
the
board
of
county
commissioners
inaugurates
an
impounding
or
a
--
a
roundup
of
these
--
of
these
horses
and
burros
and
other
animals.
it
takes
the
resolution
of
course
of
the
board
of
directors.
there
are
explicit
instructions
of
the
law
about
how
it
is
to
be
done.
kinnaman
went
to
the
meeting
of
july
the
1st.
it
was
--
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
minutes
of
july
the
1st
about
any
resolution
to
have
a
roundup.
the
next
thing
we
know
--
and
no
resolution
was
adapted.
we
--
the
next
thing
we
know
is
the
publication
notice
of
the
roundup,
july
the
10th.
it
isn't
until
september
the
2nd,
which
is
again,
a
regular
meeting
of
the
board
in
every
tuesday
or
first
tuesday
of
every
month
that
kinnaman
comes
in
and
they
adopt
retroactively
or
nunc
pro
tunc,
an
attempt
to
adopt
nunc
pro
tunc,
a
resolution
authorizing
this
--
this
proceeding.
now,
actually,
it
develops
that
kinnaman
had
gone
around
on
july
the
9th
with
a
resolution
and
got
each
commissioner
to
personally
sign
it.
but
under
the
well-established
rules,
and
certainly,
well
established
in
the
case
of
utah,
that,
of
course,
is
not
a
board
meeting.
there
was
no
special
meeting
on
the
july
the
9th.
there
was
no
meeting
of
any
kind
on
july
the
9th.
they
signed
the
resolution.
and
it
wasn't
--
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
minutes
until
--
actually,
the
meeting
of
september
the
2nd.
they
published
the
notices
and
the
notices
were
in
english,
and
of
course,
the
navajos
can't
read
english.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
couldn't
even
be
published
in
navajo
because
navajo
is
not
a
written
language.
and
as
the
--
as
the
district
court
quite
properly
said,
“it
might
have
been
--
it
might
as
well
have
been
posted
out
in
the
safe
(inaudible).”
now,
despite
this
makeshift
procedure
and
the
fact
that
they
were
proceeding
under
the
nuisance
statute,
which
contemplated
the
strong
remedy
of
destruction
for
the
animals
gathered
and
not
under
the
impoundment
act,
the
federal
agents
went
forward
with
the
horse
slaughter
program,
commencing
about
september
the
20th.
now,
i
have
told
--
i
wish
to
mention
of
course
you
surely
can't
--
both
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
rangers
are
purporting
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
state
law,
but
this
is
a
federal
grazing
district
under
the
taylor
grazing
act.
it
is
governed
by
the
federal
law
and
the
federal
regulations.
and
there's
the
federal
regulation
right
on
this
precise
point.
the
regulation
specified
that
in
case
of
a
violation,
notice
in
the
writing
should
be
given
to
the
violator
in
person
or
by
registered
mail.
we
deal
with
this
later
but
we
want
the
court
to
know
now
that
no
such
notice
as
required
by
the
federal
regulations
was
any
time
served,
nor
was
it
mailed
by
a
registered
mail
or
in
any
other
matter.
the
--
the
slaughter
program,
which
i
wish
to
bring
your
attention,
was
conducted
in
a
most
brutal
fashion.
the
government
agents
knew
that
these
horses
belonged
to
the
petitioners.
(inaudible)
to
the
bureau
of
land
management,
had
lived
in
this
area,
in
this
range
for
some
30
years
and
knew
these
indians
personally.
perhaps,
they
didn't
know
that
the
particular
horse
belonged
to
a
particular
indian
that
they
certainly
knew
they
were
indian
horses
and
that
was
the
object
of
this
hunt.
before
going
--
four-knowledge
of
these
facts,
they
went
on
the
range,
rounded
up
with
the
horses,
bullwhip
to
whip
them
into
trucks
and
corrals,
and
in
some
instance,
killing
the
horses
on
the
range.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
sir?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
horses,
according
to
the
testimony,
were
branded,
your
honor.
they
were
hauled
to
corrals
where
they
were
held
for
short
periods
of
time
for
shipping
to
a
glue
factory.
four
or
five
of
the
horses
were
so
terrified
after
being
whipped
into
corrals
and
trucks
that
they've
died
while
jammed
into
a
truck
in
this
terrifying
condition,
some
were
shot.
the
truck
arrived
at
monticello
with
living
and
dead
horses
massed
together
and
in
a
fight
--
and
in
a
frightful
disorder,
a
horse's
leg
had
--
had
inconveniently
jammed
through
the
panel
or
rigging
of
the
truck
and
couldn't
be
gotten
out.
it
is
not
clear
how
long
that
poor,
feared,
frenzied
animal
endured
the
tortures
of
that
rough
ride
over
the
--
over
the
montezuma
creek
terrain.
but
in
any
event,
when
they
got
to
monticello,
they
couldn't
get
him
out
and
i
turn
to
the
brief,
grizzly
description
of
the
record
at
this
point
because
counsel
has
made
a
--
point
in
his
brief
of
an
alleged
error
by
the
district
court.
it
said,
“well,
when
we
got
to
monticello,
four
of
them
were
down,
and
these
--
or
these
five
were
down.
one
of
them
had
his
foot
through
the
rigging,
and
we
couldn't
possibly
get
him
out
and
he
was
just
about
dead
anyhow,
so
we
had
to
shoot
him
and
shoot
his
foot
off
to
get
him
out
of
the
trucks.
there
were
two
already
dead
that
had
been
trampled
into
hauling
them
in
and
another
one
so
near
dead,
they
killed
him.
and
later,
another
got
sick
and
was
unable
to
eat
or
drink
and
we
hauled
it
out
and
shot
it
about
two
days
later.”
that's
at
page
301
of
the
record.
the
government
has
taken
occasion
to
point
out
this
particular
excerpt
because
we
said
--
we
said
in
the
findings
and
we
said
in
our
brief
perpetuating
the
statement
that
the
leg
of
the
horse
was
sawed
off
or
plainly,
the
record
shows
that
the
record
--
that
the
leg
of
the
horse
was
shot
off.
now,
i'm
not
a
particularly
--
particularly
expert
at
this
type
of
amputation
but
reason
told
me
that
they
couldn't
very
well
shoot
this
horse's
leg
off
with
a
the
right
foot
be
pretty
hard
to
do
and
the
men
went
on
with
shotguns
or
machine
guns,
so
i've
gotten
in
touch
with
the
reporter
to
verify
that.
and
the
reporter
did
make
an
error.
the
horse's
leg
for
counsel's
information
was
sawed
off
and
not
shot
off.
and
i
submit
the
affidavit
of
the
court
reporter
for
the
record
to
clarify
that
unfortunate
mistake
in
the
record.
if
counsel
can
get
any
--
any
relief,
whatever
out
of
that
error
in
the
record,
he's
welcome
to
it,
but
i
do
point
out
that
it's
the
only
place
he's
been
able
to
point
out
a
real
error
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
it
turns
out
not
to
be
an
error.
the
court's
memory
was
right.
the
leg
was
sawed
off
and
wasn't
shot
off.
and
no
other
errors
of
any
significance
have
been
--
have
been
brought
to
our
attention
at
all.
there
are
other
instances
of
brutality
in
connection
with
this
roundup.
the
record
reveals
that
the
grim
situation
where
we
find
federal
agents
participating
in
the
handcuffing
of
four
indian
women,
the
skin
of
their
wrist
were
broken
and
they
were
bleeding.
they
took
their
sheep.
they
took
the
sheep
away
from
them.
we
do
not
know
what
terrifying
conversation
took
place
among
these
women
but
the
federal
agents
and
the
white
stockmen
who
had
them
in
hand
had
one
purpose
and
that
was
to
frighten
them
off
the
range.
and
before
these
people
could
get
their
sheep
back,
they
had
to
pay
the
white
stockman,
leland
redd
in
that
particular
instance,
$488,
a
completely
unadjudicated
sum
of
course.
leland
redd
said,
“$480,”
and
the
sheriff
said,
“pay
it”
and
they
dug
down
in
what
savings
they
had
and
paid
it
to
get
the
stocks
back.
in
other
instance,
(inaudible)
approached
the
mother
of
two
children,
that's
jim
joe's
daughter
and
advised
her
that
she
must
leave
the
country
and
get
back
to
the
reservation.
she
was
one
of
the
old
residents
there
too,
and
she
was
--
and
if
she
was
still
there
in
seven
days,
he'd
arrest
her
and
--
and
she'd
had
to
leave
the
country
or
she'd
be
put
in
jail.
she
left.
on
the
redemption
of
the
horses,
the
statute
of
course
allows
the
redemption
of
horses
even
with
a
roundup
of
that
sort.
the
horses
were
to
be
kept
in
corral
not
too
far
distant
from
the
general
area
where
the
owners
resided
in
order
that
the
redemption
might
be
feasible.
in
this
case,
they
were
all
in
a
considerable
distance.
and
a
number
of
these
petitioners
trail
the
horses.
it's
a
singularly
undignified
fact
that
the
great
united
states
government
to
use
the
western
expression
actually
moonlighted
those
horses.
it
had
(inaudible)
waiting
out
on
a
mesa
behind
sakezzie's
hogan
until
the
horses
were
turned
out
and
the
indians
have
gone
to
bed
and
when
they
drifted
far
enough
away
from
their
corral,
the
--
the
bureau
of
land
management
agents
got
them,
and
got
them
into
their
trucks
and
hauled
them
away.
and
the
indians,
the
modern
indians,
being
able
to
follow
the
tire
track
and
a
boot
track
followed
the
well-known
(inaudible)
tracks
and
they
went
to
the
corral
where
these
horses
were
--
were
corralled
in
hopes
of
getting
them
back.
lee
redd,
who,
with
delbert
redd
was
a
stockman
who
shared
the
sakezzie
great
range
when
they
cancelled
his
permit
in
1947,
delbert
redd
and
leland
redd
split
it.
and
leland
redd
got
the
reservoir,
which
is
a
priceless
thing,
which
the
navajos
have
built.
leland
redd
went
off
and
brought
some
men
back
with
guns
and
the
men
were
seen
loading
and
unloading
their
guns
to
let
the
indians
know
that
they
had
guns
in
their
hands.
if
they
wanted
trouble,
they'd
have
trouble.
one
of
the
women
frightened
that
their
men
would
be
killed
and
said,
“we
better
get
out
of
here,”
and
they
left.
we
mentioned
this
in
contrast
to
the
delicate
way
in
which
the
federal
agents
dealt
with
the
horses
of
the
white
man.
they
got
theirs
back.
there
were
three
to
four
--
five
--
five
of
them,
i
believe,
rounded
up
and
they
got
them
back
without
difficulty
for
$2.50
a
head,
delivered
back
to
their
pasture
and
back
to
their
corral.
but
when
the
indians
asked
for
theirs,
$60
a
head,
which
of
course
was
impossible
because
he
didn't
have
them.
as
a
result
of
this
action,
on
the
part
of
the
federal
agents,
some
116
horses
and
38
burros
were
slaughtered
or
destroyed
or
taken
to
the
glue
factory
in
colbo
where
they
were
sold
for
two
or
three
cents
a
pound.
the
$1700
received
for
them.
it
was
given
to
the
advisory
committee
under
the
--
under
the
taylor
grazing
act,
the
local
advisory
committee
of
stockmen
who
were
the
ones
particularly
inert
into
driving
these
indians
out.
it
didn't
go
to
the
government
nor
did
it
come
back
to
the
indians.
even
the
reservoir
built
by
sakezzie
has
been
taken
over.
now,
enough
for
the
horse
program,
but
what
happened
to
trial.
we
have
to
mention
this
because
of
the
attack
which
has
been
launched
on
the
district
court.
suit
was
brought
seeking
damages.
this
was
the
first
--
the
ritter
--
judge
ritter
had
heard
the
matter
since
this
other
case
had
been
dismissed.
suit
was
brought
for
damages
by
these
people
for
local
attorneys.
why
acts
committed
by
federal
agents
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority
in
that
--
in
that
area?
the
authority
was
admitted
at
the
trial.
the
united
states
has
so
pointedly
and
shockingly
attacked
the
trial
judge
that
we
have
to
comment
upon
the
--
we
have
to
comment
upon
the
proceedings
of
trial
for
the
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
right.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
right.
it's
well
settled
and
it's
specially
established
for
the
law
of
--
it's
perfectly
clear
in
the
law
of
utah
that
the
findings
are
--
are
conclusive
as
long
as
there
is
evidence
to
sustain
them.
in
--
in
the
connection
with
this
rather
shocking
assault
by
the
government,
it's
necessary
to
point
out
that
this
trial
proceeded
in
a
very
orderly
way
up
to
the
time
when
--
when
judge
ritter
found
the
first
witness,
kinnaman,
a
very
evasive
and
elusive
witness
and
discovered
that
right
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
even
while
the
other
case
was
still
pending
in
the
court,
the
one
that
he
dismissed,
june
27th
1953.
even
while
that
case
was
still
pending,
asking
for
an
injunction,
kinnaman
have
gone
out
and
done
the
acts
which
i've
told
you
about.
these
actions
were
done
in
1952,
commencing
with
the
--
with
the
slaughter
program,
the
roundup
program
of
september
the
20th,
1952.
so,
everything
i've
told
you
was
done
while
that
original
injunction
case
was
still
pending.
and
then,
the
government
went
back
to
ritter
and
said,
“the
people
have
left.
there
are
no
more
trespassers.
they've
gone
away.
we
can
dismiss
that
the
question
is
moot,”
and
he
dismissed
that
case
on
the
grounds
that
was
moot.
so,
when
we
come
back
into
this
court
with
the
--
with
the
tort
claims
act
for
damages
for
the
destruction
of
that
property
of
the
indians,
i
think
any
judge
would
be
reasonably
concerned
about
it.
and
when
kinnaman
admitted
and
he
has
repeatedly
admitted,
i
won't
get
to
the
record
and
take
the
time,
but
in
our
reply
brief,
we
set
forth
immediately
at
the
further
reply
brief
the
admissions
of
kinnaman
that
--
that
he
does
destroying
the
stock
right
--
while
he
was
talking
to
the
judge,
the
program
was
going
on.
now,
these
were
reluctant
witnesses.
of
course,
the
judge
was
indignant.
of
course,
he
became
curious
with
this
type
of
proceeding.
in
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
never
aware
until
i
read
counsel's
brief
that
--
that
there
was
any
tradition
that
a
man
--
that
an
appointment
to
the
federal
bench
meant
that
a
man
was
sterilized
in
his
capacity
for
moral
indignation.
it
seems
to
be
implied
that
--
that
he
shouldn't
have
had
these
feelings
but
they
were
outrageous
facts
which
he
confronted
in
this
case.
their
answer
is
not
an
attack
upon
the
findings.
they
have
not
successfully
launched
an
attack
upon
the
findings.
they've
attacked
the
judge.
is
that
a
way
to
rehabilitate
a
new
technique
for
rehabilitating
evasive
and
--
and
unsatisfactory
witnesses
whom
the
judge
does
not
believe
and
who
are
in
absolute
contempt
to
court
in
the
conduct
they
were
following?
perhaps
so.
now,
in
respect
to
damages,
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners,
the
evidence
told
--
showed
unique
value
of
these
horses
and
burro.
let
us
skip
lightly
over
it.
i've
touched
on
some
of
the
main
factors.
without
these
horses,
the
navajos
can't
live.
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
value.
the
white
men
said
they
were
worth
two
or
three
cents
a
pound,
the
glue
factory
of
what
they
got,
what
they
got
for
them.
they
weren't
white
men's
horses.
they
were
indian
horses,
of
great,
unique
value
to
the
indian
civilization,
used
for
every
conceivable
purpose,
in
the
transportation
of
wood
from
distances
that
you
--
that
are
unbelievable
to
us,
to
keep
those
hogans
through
those
bitterly
cold
utah
winters.
all
those
things
that
the
horses
and
the
burros
did
for
the
indians
that
go
into
the
question
of
testimony.
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
the
testimony
shows
that
they
--
they
weren't
ordinary
in
any
respect.
they
were
bred
for
the
country
and
trained
for
the
country.
the
navajos
trained
them
carefully.
they
could
go
for
two
or
three
days
without
water,
the
ordinary
horse
can't.
the
ordinary
horse
gets
lame
on
the
hard
plains
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
prairie
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
country
that
we're
in
now.
you
can't
use
them
and
these
horses
are
specially
trained
for
those
purposes.
they
obey
the
navajos'
command
and
they
can
be
turned
loose
on
the
range
and
always
come
home.
these
attributes,
the
navajos'
horses
are
absolutely
unique.
the
--
the
burros
too
had
some
of
these
distinguishing
qualities.
and
so,
the
court
entered
a
judgment
of
$100,000.
there
is
agreement
in
the
record
as
to
number
of
horses
and
burros
owned
by
each
of
the
petitioners,
not
stipulated.
and
the
government
objects
to
the
$100,000
as
excessive
according
to
the
white
man's
evaluation
of
the
horses.
we
have
established
and
i
submit
it
on
the
briefs
without
a
discussion,
overwhelming
authority
to
defect
as
to
the
allowance
of
damages
for
actual
and
consequential
damages
are
sustained
by
the
utah
decisions.
and
if
there
is
any
evidence
to
support
judgment,
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
sustained
and
not
reversed,
whether
there's
any
evidence
whatever
they
stand.
but
on
this
$100,000,
we
are
certainly
dealing
with
trivia.
may
i
–
may
i
suggest
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
embrace
the
impacts
of
this
incident
on
this
indian
order.
how
can
a
white
man
understand
a
man
like
sakezzie,
a
magnificent,
big
navajo,
kindly,
patient,
understanding,
a
leader
of
his
people,
when
he
says,
“i
cried”
or
an
indian
to
cry
for
sakezzie
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
consequent
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
conceive
the
measure
of
damages
to
be
what
the
district
judge
has
found
them
to
be,
your
honor.
their
horses
had
a
unique
value.
there
were
consequential
damages
that
he
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
among
the
indians.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
there
is
an
indian
market
where
there
are
horses
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
counsel
will
--
counsel
will
tell
you
and
he
said
it
in
his
brief
that
they
--
even
sakezzie,
one
of
the
leaders
that
i'm
referring
to,
mentioned
that
some
of
these
horses
would
sell
for
$200
to
$300
among
the
indians.
they
wouldn't
--
there
wasn't
a
big
enough
sum
to
buy
them
now
that
they're
gone.
i
mean,
when
there's
a
little
traffic
among
the
indians,
yes,
but
there
isn't
a
big
enough
sum
to
replace
them
with.
these
--
these
people
are
stricken
without
their
method
of
transportation.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
just
follow
the
--
just
follow
the
--
the
laws
of
the
state
of
utah
on
the
measure
of
damages,
and
the
--
the
court
has
entered
the
findings
on
that
basis.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
given
--
it's
given
even
for
fright
under
the
laws
of
utah
in
cases
which
we've
cited.
it's
given
even
for
freight.
and
that
is
--
that
is
a
controlling
law
of
the
case.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it
can't
but
it's
the
only
measure
we
have,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
there's
just
isn't
anything
else.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
you
can't.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
it's
how
frequently
we
come
into
that
measurement
in
the
law,
do
we
not,
where
you
have
nothing
else
to
go
on?
there
are
irreplaceable
objects
without
a
shadow
of
doubt,
priceless
in
value.
well,
the
court
has
heard
it
and
he
said,
“they're
worth
a
$100,000.”
that's
the
least
and
little
enough.
well,
no
wonder
in
view
of
these
facts
that
the
court
entered
an
injunction.
he
had
been
taken
into
dismissing
the
fire
suit
in
which
he
had
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
your
honor,
we
admit
a
slight
measure
of
error
here,
an
injunction
against
the
united
states.
we
are
well
enough
informed
to
know
that
you
can't
enjoin
the
united
states.
but
under
the
harrowing
circumstances
of
this
case,
he
could
enjoin
the
officers
in
our
opinion,
and
we
submit
that
the
injunction
stands
for
that
purpose.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
oh
--
oh,
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
well,
he
used
the
language
(inaudible)
i'm
sure
he
used
the
–
the
language
in
all
officers
of
the
united
states.
i'm
just
looking
–
the
assistant
is
just
looking
up
--
the
associate
of
justice
is
just
looking
up
that
order,
your
honor,
but
i'm
sure
he
used
that
language.
it's
a
little
on
the
general
side.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
they
weren't
parties.
i
--
i
understood
that
i
answered
that,
your
honor.
they
weren't
not
–
they
were
not
parties.
that's
quite
right.
and
perhaps
it's
not
–
the
order
appears
at
page
48.
perhaps
it's
not
of
the
record.
perhaps
it's
not
worth
our
going
into
it.
it's
the
judgment,
the
restraining
order
of
january
the
18th
1954.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
counsel
points
out
--
reminds
me
that
at
page
84,
it
was
entered
sua
sponte
when
he
did
found
out
they're
destroying
the
horses
to
bring
--
to
bring
the
powers
of
--
of
the
court
to
bear
on
the
situation
which
was
completely
out
of
hand.
and
actually,
he
was
capable
of
contempt,
susceptible
to
contempt
proceedings
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
--
of
the
proceeding
was
being
destroyed
even
while
the
witness,
kinneman,
was
testifying
in
court.
so
it's
an
order
of
issue
in
the
course
of
the
trial
to
the
--
to
the
officers.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
can
--
consisting
of
judges
who
are
not
from
the
state
of
utah
have
not
heard
the
witnesses
and
failed
to
evaluate
the
reason
for
judge
ritter's
indignation,
held
that
the
utah
abandoned
horse
statute,
the
nuisance
statute
applied
and
controlled
and
--the
–
it
reversed
the
--
the
judge
below
and
the
judgment
for
damages
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
now,
the
issues
as
we
see
them,
i'm
coming
to
that
point
very
briefly.
first,
if
the
taylor
grazing
act
so
occupied
the
field
as
to
leave
any
room
for
the
operation
of
the
utah
wild
or
abandoned
horse
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
abandoned
horse
statute.
that
is
the
nuisance
law
of
utah.
it's
our
position
of
course
that
in
view
of
the
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
federal
laws,
one,
that
there
was
no
room
for
the
operation
of
the
utah
law.
two,
that
in
view
of
the
taylor
grazing
act
regulations,
that
this
was
not
the
utah
statute
which
the
agents
of
the
united
states
were
empowered
to
invoke.
give
me
the
54,
page
54.
well,
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment,
finishing
the
issues
--
just
one
second
while
i
finish
this
issue.
if
your
honor
agrees
with
us
that
the
utah
act
was
not
enforced
because
of
the
preeminence
of
the
taylor
grazing
act,
then
a
large
area
of
the
case
in
disposed
of
immediate
injure
left
to
the
tort
question.
however,
if
the
utah
abandoned
horse
statute
was
applicable
or
could
possibly
be
invoked,
if
you
should
so
hold,
which
we
do
not
think
you
will,
or
there
was
any
compliance
with
its
provisions
and
of
course
we
hold
there
was
no
compliance
with
its
provisions,
it
was
a
garbled
mess
in
an
attempt
to
hold
--
get
a
resolution
for
that
--
for
that
slaughter
and
forfeiture
program.
anything,
any
act
in
the
nature,
forfeiture
is
strictly
construed
and
it
was
not
complied
with.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
precisely,
your
honor,
precisely,
and
the
difference
between
them
is
fundamental.
the
taylor
grazing
act
required
notice,
the
service
of
notice.
all
through
this
case,
they
intend
to
preserve
an
atmosphere
we
don't
know
who
these
horses
belong
to.
they
knew
all
the
time
who
those
horses
belong
to
and
(inaudible)
admitted,
he
named
them
and
he
lived
without
--
with
those
people
for
30
years
and
knew
them
all.
and
besides,
they
are
concluded
on
that
point
by
the
fact
that
they
had
their
names
and
addresses
and
their
files
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
permits
which
had
been
issued
to
these
people
up
to
1947.
to
say
they
didn't
know
was
preposterous,
but
they
have
to
say
they
didn't
know
to
make
the
abandoned
horse
statute
stick.
if
they
know
who
they
are,
they
--
and
go
under
the
other
act,
they've
got
to
--
they've
got
to
serve
notice,
they're
in
a
different
category.
now,
continuing
with
the
issues
to
get
the
issues
clearly
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
after
1947.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
the
condition
we're
dealing
with
but
it's
a
matter
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
that's
--
your
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
alleged
trespassers,
alleged
trespassers.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
actual
notice.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
actual
notice,
actual
written
notice.
hand
them
one
copy.
the
part
that
provides
on
page
54
of
our
brief,
the
blue
copy,
procedure
for
enforcement,
service
of
notice
is
in
the
brief,
whenever
it
appears
there
had
been
a
willful
violation,
many
provision
of
the
act,
for
the
federal
range
code
for
grazing
districts,
the
range
manager
will
cause
the
alleged
violator
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
to
be
served
with
a
written
notice.
now,
drop
down
to
the
regulations,
that
these
are
the
regulations.
i
beg
your
pardon,
those
are
the
regulations,
the
--
the
actual
statute
is
--
is
--
it
appears
on
the
preceding
page.
on
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it's
the
last
sentence
of
--
of
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes.
now,
drop
down
to
the
next
paragraph,
b,
unlawful
grazing
on
the
federal
range
and
movement
of
livestock,
impoundment,
impoundment
after
he
served
notice.
whenever
the
charge
consists
of
unlawful
grazing
on
the
federal
range,
the
notice
served
an
alleged
violator
and
on
any
interested
lien
holder
and
so
forth
will
order
the
alleged
violator
to
remove
the
stock
or
cause
them
to
be
removed
immediately
or
within
reasonable
--
such
reasonable
times
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i'm
--
i'm
just
coming
up
with
the
next
line,
mr.
justice,
but
i
want
to
comment
on
that.
i
--
you're
--
you're
just
one
step
ahead
of
me.
if
he
fails
to
comply
with
a
notice,
the
range
manager
may
be
--
may
proceed
to
exercise
the
proprietary
right
of
the
united
states
in
the
federal
range
under
local
impoundment
law
and
procedure
if
possible.
this
is
not
an
impoundment
law,
this
is
a
nuisance
statute,
this
is
a
forfeiture
and
destruction
statute.
the
impoundment
law
is
the
other
law
which
i
have
under
the
agricultural
section
of
the
utah
act,
chapter
12,
title
1
--
volume
1,
utah
code
for
1953,
chapter
12.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
yes,
it's
at
page
--
it's
not
as
fully
discussed
in
the
brief
as
i
--
i
have
left
some
of
this
area
for
oral
argument.
it's
on
page
23.
both
statutes
are
cited
at
23.
and
i
call
your
attention
only
briefly
to
this,
that
the
federal
grazing
act
refer
to
an
impounding
law,
a
local
impounding
act
and
procedure.
the
only
impounding
act
you
can
find
in
the
utah
books
is
the
one
i'm
calling
your
attention
which
they
did
not
use.
and
why
didn't
they
use
it?
because
only
after
reasonable
efforts
to
ascertain
the
owners
can
they
use
that
law
and
they
knew
who
the
owners
were
and
they
didn't
want
the
reasonable
efforts
and
they
didn't
want
to
advertise
for
sale
and
let
these
people
bid
back
their
own
stock,
they
wanted
to
destroy
it.
and
they
told
that
has
chose
the
most
brutal
statute
of
the
two,
one
which
under
their
own
regulations,
they
were
not
authorized
to
take.
there
is
not
one
word
of
abandonment
--
of
--
of
a
--
impound
--
and
regard
to
impounding
in
the
nuisance
law,
not
a
word.
impounding
in
this
other
act
that
i've
just
referred
to
appears
several
times
and
the
constable
is
the
–
is
the
impounding
officer.
and
when
they
impound
the
--
the
stock,
they
keep
it
for
so
many
days
and
they
published
notice
impounding,
impounding,
impounding.
it's
clearly
implicit
that
that's
what
the
federal
grazing
regulations
meant,
because
that
is
consistent
with
the
federal
law.
this
nuisance
statute
of
destruction
of
horses
without
notice,
with
no
chance
to
redeem
them,
no
actual
real
chance
to
redeem
them
as
far
as
the
indians
were
concerned,
is
certainly
not
in
accordance
with
the
taylor
grazing
act.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
were
not
acting
outside
of
the
law
because
the
--
the
department
had
then
authorized
them
to
do
it
and
took
position.
this
wasn't
in
the
law.
they
defended
by
saying
this
was
a
practice
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
they
were
acting
--
they
were
acting
under
the
abandoned
horse
statute
which
that
department,
the
bureau
of
land
management
said,
“this
is
in
accordance
with
our
practice.
we're
going
to
use
this.
they've
done
it
before.”
and
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
in
my
opinion,
they
have
no
legal
right
to
use
it
under
their
own
taylor
grazing
act
instructions.
for
those
regulations,
say,
an
impounding
law,
this
is
not
an
impounding
law.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
--
well,
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
yes,
but
they
were
authorized
by
their
own
department
to
do
it.
they
weren't
employees
that
were
acting
out
in
the
blue
without
authority.
they
had
a
clear
authority
and
the
authority
is
admitted
in
this
record
by
counsel
for
the
government
and
the
bureau
of
land
management
officials.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that
might
be
it.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
did
indeed,
your
honor.
well,
briefly
on
the
issues,
my
time
is
running
hard
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
i
think
it
was
the
most
deliberate
mistake
that
was
ever
made.
the
other
law
is
completely
unsatisfactory
for
their
purposes.
the
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
well
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
oh,
yes.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
we
face
that.
we
face
that
without
a
doubt
but
the
entire
department
was
behind
them.
they
had
their
authority
from
the
bureau
of
land
management
to
act
and
they
assumed
that
this
act
or
wished
to
assume
that
this
act
was
available
to
them,
because
it
amount
--
it
allowed
for
the
immediate
dispatch
of
these
horses,
the
other
act
would
not.
there
will
be
a
chance
to
redeem
them
and
not
by
any
$60
or
other
payment
but
simply
by
the
refunding
the
cost
of
--
of
the
advertising
and
the
cost
of
impounding
in
keeping
the
horses,
that
the
impounding
statute.
yes,
all
right.
skipping
the
other
issues,
we
--
i'd
like
to
mention
in
passing
that
even
assuming
compliance
with
the
statute
and
assuming
it
is
illegal,
revisions
of
statutes
were
unconstitutional
in
view
of
the
inadequate
notice
under
--
under
the
named
case
of
this
decision,
of
this
court.
then,
we'd
come
to
the
government's
issue
which
is
perhaps
the
main
issue
of
this
case
undoubtedly.
does
the
federal
tort
claims
act
cover
authorize
trespass
or
much
of
these
indians
or
must
these
indians
go
uncompensated
for
these
depredations?
the
government
falls
back
to
raise
query
of
the
tort
issue
in
this
case.
the
government
falls
back
upon
the
doctrine
that
the
trespassers
committed
by
the
government
agents
within
the
scope
of
their
authority
are
not
compensable
under
the
tort
claims
act.
the
operative
words
in
the
act
are
negligence
and
negligent
and
wrongful.
this
court
had
worked
those
--
worked
over
those
words
so
often
that
i
can
add
little
light
to
--
if
at
--
if
at
all,
to
your
understanding.
but
i
ask,
what
would
“wrongful”
possibly
mean
if
it
didn't
mean
trespasses
and
we
have
quoted
section
of
the
legislative
history.
it
shows
that
it
clearly
contemplates
that.
certainly,
the
tort
claims
act
cannot
be
interposed
to
provide
a
simple,
non-jury
negligence
practice
that
the
government's
construction
would
simply
strike
from
the
word
--
strike
out
from
the
act
the
word
“wrongful,”
to
allow
its
full
scope.
and
i
submit
in
the
illustration
these
two
cases.
if
a
driver
of
a
government
mail
truck
sets
out
from
the
post
office
and
negligently
hits
somebody
on
the
street,
liability.
he's
in
the
course
of
his
official
duties
acting
with
authority,
liability.
if
the
post
master
general
steps
out
and
gives
him
specific
instructions
before
he
starts,
“drive
down
the
street
and
drive
very
carefully.
don't
drive
negligently
but
drive
right
into
mr.
smith's
truck
down
there
and
smash
it
up.”
under
the
government's
view,
the
government
would
be
liable
in
the
first
case,
no
liability
in
the
next
--
in
the
next
case,
the
dalehite
case.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i'm
assuming
the
concession
that
is
within
this
scope
of
authority
as
counsel
reminded
me,
it
have
to
be.
the
second
case,
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
building
a
dam
and
the
crane
is
working
and
he's
out
at
the
site,
and
here
is
a
sign
saying,
“no
parking,
government
property.
trespassers
will
be
prosecuted,”
and
so
forth,
but
there
is
a
car
parked
there.
the
secretary
says
to
the
crane
operator,
“whose
car
is
that?”
“i
don't
know
mr.
secretary."
well,
these
tourists
i
supposed.
they're
not
supposed
to
be
there,
there
are
the
signs,
right
in
our
way.”
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
says
to
the
crane
operator,
“lower
your
crane.pick
up
that
car
and
drop
it
off
in
the
canyon.”
under
the
government's
view,
no
liability.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
if
the
court
--
if
the
court
please.
i
can't
pass
wholly
unchallenged
the
statement
however
immaterial
in
this
case,
bearing
on
its
perspectives
that
congress
has
sanctioned
and
insisted
that
these
indians
move
back
to
the
reservation.
that
simply
isn't
true.
i
ask
you
to
bear
in
mind
the
finding
of
the
court
that
these
indians
dwelt
here
peaceably
and
the
record
shows
that
they
did
up
until
kinneman
came
in
1946
as
range
manager.
and
in
1947,
their
permits
were
canceled.
the
record
shows
they
were
cancelled
because
they
were
given
seven
months
permits
and
they
wouldn't
go
to
the
reservation
for
five
months.
there's
not
a
blade
of
grass
on
that
reservation
as
if
the
commissions
of
the
district
of
columbia
ordered
my
wife
and
myself
to
move
in
the
apartment
of
our
next
door
neighbors.
they're
very
nice
people
and
i
think
we're
reasonably
nice
people,
but
it
simply
wouldn't
work.
there
is
no
room.
that
is
the
backdrop
of
drama
behind
this
case
in
which
the
alleged
plot,
the
proven
plot
or
collaboration
between
the
local
ranchers,
the
county
officials,
taking
in
kinneman
and
his
crowd
completely
have
moved
in
to
insist
that
these
people
be
driven
back
the
reservation.
there
is
no
power
to
order
them
to
the
reservation.
they
were
bona
fide
settlers,
recognized
conclusively
as
such
by
this
very
bureau
itself,
by
the
issuing
--
issuance
of
permits.
those
permits
could
never
have
been
issued
if
they
were
not
in
some
way
entitled
to
be
there.
that's
a
long
subject
of
title.
i
know
that
and
title
is
not
in
this
case,
but
i
couldn't
pass
on
--
without
notice
of
those
facts.
and
as
you
look
at
the
record,
you
will
notice
the
great
difficulty
that
the
court
had
in
getting
the
files,
getting
the
records
in.
at
page
393,
the
court
asked
who
where
the
permittees
here
and
there
was
great
reluctance
to
give
him
the
permittees
and
they
never
did
get
in.
they
finally
got
a
stipulated
statement
of
facts
as
to
what
all
the
cattle
were
and
the
sheep
in
this
district
showing
that
from
this
case
a
pitifully
small
amount
involved
in
the
indian
issue.
and
mr.
black,
agent
for
the
government,
testified
that
out
of
an
estimated
40,000,
30,000
belonged
to
one
man,
charles
red.
the
range
of
sakezzie,
when
they
cancelled
his
permit,
was
divided
between
leland,
red
and
velvet
red.
those
facts,
even
though
the
court
was
unsuccessful
in
getting
into
the
record
the
names
of
the
permittees
who
were
closing
the
vice
on
this
little
band
of
the
last
of
the
mohicans
in
that
area,
still
the
fact
show
what
was
happening
clearly
and
uncontrovertibly.
and
who
was
in
the
front
line
trench
when
they
conducted
this
operation.
the
same
ranchers,
that
leland,
red
went
and
got
the
gun.
the
case
can't
go
off
on
that
of
course.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
--
the
government
is
liable,
your
honor,
on
the
theory
that
this
is
a
wrong.
there
has
to
be
proved
negligence,
of
negligent
or
wrongful
act
within
the
scope
of
authority.
and
it's
illustrated
by
the
two
questions
i
left
yesterday,
the
truck
driver
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority,
the
male
truck
driver
negligently
hits
a
car,
the
government
is
admittedly
liable.
we
have
many
cases
on
the
negligence
front.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
sir?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
were
acting,
mr.
justice
clark,
under
specific
instructions
of
their
own
bureau
to
proceed
under
the
abandoned
horse
statute
and
they
did
so
which
means
collaboration
with
the
--
with
the
sheriff,
with
the
advisory
committee
of
the
stockman
and
all
that.
there's
a
straight
line
of
authority,
they're
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
authority
under
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
who
--
who
didn't
know?
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
had
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
they
had
repeatedly
conducted
these
programs
and
presumably
knew
all
about
it.
it's
admitted
in
the
record
at
page
64
by
a
sound
stipulation
of
counsel
that
the
acts
were
thoroughly
authorized
by
the
government.
how
much
they
knew
behind
the
scenes
within
the
bureau
is
one
of
the
imponderables
but
it
isn't
material.
they've
admitted
it
in
the
record.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
because
we
fall
back
on
the
part
which
i
couldn't
argue
and
submit
it
on
the
brief.
it's
unconstitutional.
there
was
no
notice.
the
mullane
case
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
the
mullane
case,
we
fall
back
on
other
arguments
but
that's
the
principal
one.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
think
it's
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
tort,
but
i
believe
that
we
would
fall
back
if
this
court
held
that
the
proceedings
were
perfectly
regular.
and
the
abandoned
horse
statute
was
properly
applied
which
of
course
as
i
pointed
out
just
yesterday,
it
was
not.
it's
the
other
statute
that
should
have
been
applied
providing
for
notice
like
the
federal
regulation.
but
if
the
abandoned
horse
statute
was
--
was
sustained
in
this
court
under
all
of
these
facts,
i
would
still
fall
back
from
the
fact
that
there
was
no
notice.
and
that
was
an
unconstitutional
seizure
and
confiscation
of
property.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
your
honor,
this
is
a
liquid
feel
of
which
this
court
is
trustee
for
the
country.
and
that
--
in
this
case
of
this
violence
in
the
confiscation
and
destruction
of
personal
property
by
the
wrongful
acts
of
these
agents
with
the
authority
of
their
department,
is
certainly
not
within
the
language
of
that
act.
you
--
to
get
that
conclusion,
you
have
to
drop
the
word
“wrongful”
from
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
what
--
mr.
norman
m.
littell
it
--
it
wouldn't
be
wrongful.
i
can't
--
couldn't
conceive
it
being
wrongful
if
there
was
an
adjudication
of
the
whole
process.
you
get
into
a
whole
new
area
of
discussion
at
that
point
on
the
question
of
right
--
whether
it
be
wrongful
if
it
had
been
dully
adjudicated
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
that
would
raise
an
entirely
different
matter,
i
think.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
i
beg
your
--
no.
oh,
no.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
no,
this
isn't
a
--
this
isn't
a
prosecution.
it's
just
an
overt
taking
of
the
property
and
the
destruction
of
it.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
that's
right.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
concludes
my
time.
mr.
norman
m.
littell
thank
you
very
much.
