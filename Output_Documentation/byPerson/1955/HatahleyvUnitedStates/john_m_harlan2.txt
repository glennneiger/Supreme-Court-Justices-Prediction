are

any

how

point.
was
there
any
finding

way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
or
not
the
brands
were
filed
with
the
county
commissioners
as

there
is
a
dispute
that

none.
justice
john

and
your
claim
is,
as
i
understand
it,
even
though
the
evidence
was
or
the
finding
was
that
some
brands
are
recorded,
that
in
itself
was
not
enough

a

isn't
the
real
nub
of
this
controversy,
whether
or
not
the
utah
abandoned
horse
law
applies
and
if
it
applies
whether
its
provisions
were
followed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
it
applies
and
its
provisions
were
followed,
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
does
it,
whether
the
motive
was
to
oust
these
indians?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
do
you
say
to
the
reverse
of
that?
if
the
abandoned
horse
law
does
not
apply
or
was
not
a
problem,
what's
your
position
then
as
far
as
liability
is
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
say
to
this?
assuming
everything
that
you
say
is
true
that
this
was
a
malicious
plot
to
destroy
these
animals
to
get
the
indians
out,
what's
your
theory
then
on
which
the
government
under
the
tort
claims
act
would
be
liable?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
turn
the
question,
my
question
around?
do
you
agree
that
if
it
is
concluded
that
the
abandoned
horse
law
statute
does
apply,
it's
not
superseded
by
the
federal
grazing
act
and
that
it
was
complied
with,
doesn't
that
put
you
out
of
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
apart
from
that
argument
then,
even
though
you
accept
the
motive
as
being
to
oust
the
indians,
that
wouldn't
get
you
a
whole
motive.
