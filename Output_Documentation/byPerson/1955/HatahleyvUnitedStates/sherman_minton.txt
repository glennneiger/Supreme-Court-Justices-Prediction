justice
sherman
minton
is
it
your
contention
that
the
government
handed
the
federal
--
on
the
taylor
grazing
act
so
completely
occupied
the
field
by
providing
for
a
punishment
of
trespassers,
that
that's
the
proceeding
that
the
government
should
have
followed
rather
than
do
an
attempt
and
to
proceed
under
the
utah
act?
justice
sherman
minton
well,
i
mean,
on
--
in
court,
where
did
you
--
did
you
present
that
to
the
court
of
appeals?
to
the
district
court?
