before
you
do
that,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
to
follow
up
the
horses
that
--
that
you
were
talking
about,
when
the
chief
asked
you
about
whether
they
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
corralled,
the
court
found
that
they
watched
them
and
then
picked
them
up?
what
happened
to
those
particular
horses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
these
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
what
you
said
afterwards,
they
--
was
--
was
some
of
them
shot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
took
these
particular
horses
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
onto
a
corral,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
kept
them
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
agents.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
--
then
what
did
they
do
with
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
they
dispose
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
authority
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
selling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
the
government
agents
picked
them
up
on
the
public
lands.
justice
hugo
l.
black
herd
them
to
a
corral.
who
ran
that
corral,
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government's
corral.
and
then
they
sold
them?
were
they
all
sold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
what
point
did
the
government
officers
begin
to
act
under
the
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
when
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
--
when
the
government
agents
picked
them
up
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
public
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
part
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
part
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
could
have
disposed
of
them
under
the
federal
law,
could
they
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
that
precise
procedure,
but
did
the
federal
law
provide
a
method
for
taking
care
of
horses
like
that
when
--
that
they
caught?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
were
--
but
there
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
trespassers,
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
trespassers
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
federal
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
does
provide
a
remedy
for
the
government,
under
which
the
government
officials
can
act
disposing
of
horses
seized
precisely
as
these
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
what
is
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it's
your
position
--
it's
your
position
that
no
disposition
could
be
made
of
these
horses
by
the
government
under
the
taylor
grazing
act
or
any
regulation
passed
pursuant
to
it
unless
they
went
through
the
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
there
was
no
other
procedure
that
could
be
followed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
couldn't
proceed
any
other
--
make
any
other
procedure
for
seizing
them
at
all
or
protecting
the
government's
interest
from
those
trespassing
animals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
are
you
in
a
position
to
dispute
it
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
do
with
the
provision
of
the
act
that
says
that
the
tort
act
says
it
shall
not
apply
torts
brought
about
by
abusive
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
it's
done
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
under
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
still
sue
under
the
tort
claims
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
call
this
a
prosecution
where
yours
doesn't
go
through
a
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
action
also
provides
--
exempts
torts
that
relate
to
malicious
prosecution
or
abusive
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
saying,
i
suppose,
that
the
mere
fact
that
they
did
use
the
law
to
punish
them
in
the
perpetration
of
what
is
a
tort
under
utah
law
by
these
people,
does
not
excuse
them
merely
because
the
--
the
prosecution
part
of
it
might
have
been
malicious
or
might
have
been
wrong.
