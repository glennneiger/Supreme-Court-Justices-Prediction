justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
assumed
in
saying
that
this
rule
and
the
--
the
broadcasting
rules
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
difference
between
the
--
the
board?
justice

frankfurter
but
under
the
chain
broadcasting
rules,
the
petition
on
applicants
are
being
foreclosed,
which
were
being
thrown
out
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean?
316?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
319
means?
you
said
precisely
what
you
said
to
be
applicable.
it
isn't
here,
namely,
that
this
doesn't
deal
grounded
and
flexible
whereas
not
--
prohibit
whether
to
say,
an
applicant
to
say,
consisted
it
for
embracing
the
provisions
of
the
act
in
this
particular
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
public
interest
would
defer
to
address
them
as
(inaudible)
and
a
part
of
deny
by
acquiring
the
general
rule.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
itself
--
the
commission
itself
say
that
representation
to
the
court
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
exactly
not
the
first
thing
under
jurisdiction
rather
that
was
a
reviewable
order,
i
mean
such
as
on
the
controlling,
the
commission
contended
that
the
rules
were
--
and
so
reported,
subsequently
that
the
rules
were
not
trying
to
apply
the
rules
but
it
merely
tried
(inaudible)
for
its
own
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
reflected
in
--
in
that
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
decision
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
the
alternatives
are
--
wanted
that
in
these
result.
i
don't
think
the
alternatives
are
the
rules
being
nothing
as
you
have
indicated.
those
aren't
the
alternatives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
the
--
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
doesn't
deny
--
obviously,
it
doesn't
deny
a
rule-making
power.
it
doesn't
deny
--
doesn't
require
that
in
each
case,
we
have
to
rejustify
the
old
rules.
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
itself
that
since
the
rules
themselves
are
the
province
derived
from
the
statutory
criteria
of
public
interest,
the
rule
cannot
conclusively
bar
an
applicant
from
saying
whatever
power
in
respect
to
the
validity
--
validity
of
the
matter
of
public
interest
or
the
problems.
the
rules
we
may
have
--
we
would
like
to
show
to
the
commissioner
in
the
state
that
public
interest
is
to
depart
from
the
rules
in
this
case.
that
doesn't
mean
in
every
case,
(inaudible)
as
dealing.
in
every
case,
you
have
to
have
a
submersion
and
a
nullification
of
the
rules
because
you
have
ample
power
and
i
suppose
would
rather
summarily
on
claims
that
they
have
no
merit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
you
--
would
it
have
made
a
difference
with
these
parties
and
labor
there
--
what
do
they
call
it,
an
application?
if
they
call
it
an
application
for
a
waiver
of
a
rule
(inaudible)0,
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
merely
that
it
doesn't
follow
that
because
on
a
showing
made,
you
can
say
the
showing
is
so
pointing
in
view
of
the
general
policy
that
was
laid
down,
that
we
don't
give
you
plenary
hearing.
it
doesn't
follow
that
therefore,
you
can
lay
down
rules
that
are
so
definitive
and
comprehensive
that
nobody
can
say,
"i'd
like
to
show
in
this
case
the
public
interest
is
against
what
your
rules
would
require
in
some
of
the
employer."
i
don't
see
much
difference.
that
seems
merely
a
formality
to
say,
"why
don't
they
apply
for
a
waiver?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
kind
of
a
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
heard
that
this
theory
is
--
without
meaning
to
argue
the
(inaudible)
but
you
must
carve
out
most
of
the
field
by
generality
to
include
personal
application
--
individual
application.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
court
in
319
has
given
you
a
very
properly
(inaudible)
has
been
the
very
broad
leeway
as
to
your
judgment
of
what
the
public
interest
was
in
laying
down
the
general
consideration
born
of
your
experience
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
and
we
have
to
be
very
obvious
with
that
for
you
to
say,
this
wasn't
susceptible
of
the
formulation
with
generality,
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
the
law,
each
thing
is
being
tried
all
over
again
whether
criteria
are
relevant
to
the
general
policy
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
hasn't
yet
laid
down
a
general
rule
--
promulgated
general
rules
regarding
consummated
ownership
of
the
newspapers
and
none
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
those
(inaudible)
and
specifically
is
a
very
serious
question.
i
should
think
they
could
lay
down
some
general
rules.
that's
clearly
whether
you
could
to
lay
down
an
absolute
exclusion
of
the
rule,
exclusionary
to
the
extent
that
nobody
can
say,
"look,
in
this
case,
decided
as
a
public
interest
to
have
a
license
between
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

did
not
answer
that.
i'd
like
the
very
--
present
this
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
appeal
to
what
you
can
take
over
by
a
general
rule
that
leaves
no
opportunity
of
conflict,
doesn't
give
you
a
continuation,
the
public
interest
out
of
all
the
(inaudible)
was
against
the
application,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
case
--
which
case,
other
than
the
broadcasting
case,
as
the
court
made
--
as
the
board
comes
here
with
a
rule
which
of
course
completely
excluded
as
of
its
notion
of
the
public
interest
and
preclude
a
particular
applicant
from
saying,
"i
come
within
the
public
interest
and
outside
of
the
considerations
of
the
general
rule."
which
case
other
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
mean
an
oral
hearing,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
oral
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

to
submit
your
claims,
you're
out
of
the
rules?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
why
administrative
agencies
do
not
give
hearings
if
this
court
doesn't
see
itself
with
the
--
obliged
to
the
duties
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
issues
involving
those
very
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i'm
just
speaking
in
the
part
of
what
a
hearing
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
a
hearing
doesn't
mean
to
me
to
require
all
dispositions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
--
you
did
not
have
in
that
case,
did
you,
general
rules
for
which
this
was
deemed
to
be
a
deviation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
there
weren't
general
rules
of
policy
under
which
the
commission
rejected
the
consideration
to
the
applicant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
a
hearing
is
required,
you
say
it's
that
kind
of
a
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
question
of
whether
assuming
the
commissioner's
power
to
lay
down
general
rules
of
policy,
exclusionary
rules
in
a
normal
instance,
they
say,
however,
anyone
who
wants
to
be
part
of
conditional
rules
made
by
appropriate
applications
by
brief
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
i've
just
put
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
going
to
be
--
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
your
controversy
in
this
case
was
down
to
this,
that
it
is
your
contention
that
the
commission
to
its
rule
making
power
cannot
make
class
determination
of
what
constitutes
public
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
cannot
--
well,
if
the
commission
cannot
make
class
determination
of
public
interest
so
as
to
preclude
an
individual
from
showing
the
particular
instance
that
the
public
interest
is
--
would
be
serve
by
a
grant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
there
a
way
to
attack
this
specific
act
or
--
or
rule
of
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
say
--
to
say
this
rule
has
been
valid
and
(inaudible)
you're
not
attacking
the
rule
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
you
cross,
mr.
connelly,
once
you
cross
the
line
of
power,
did
i
understood
the
exercises
then
i
think
most
exercises
a
discretional
power
that
are
largely
in
the
case
or
rather
is
there
intuitions
(inaudible)
would
be
drawn
out
of
the
--
as
you
say,
drawn
out
of
the
hat
but
it's
the
commission's
hat,
assuming
they
have
the
power.
i
do
not
believe
on
this
part
of
your
argument,
they
could
make
any
rule
that
wouldn't
be
punishable
to
a
critical
examination
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
am
not
--
that
is
to
the
inference.
i
am
saying
that
whatever
rule
they
take
other
than
obviously
rules
that
have
no
relation
to
any
experience
on
which
presumably
to
the
state
the
outside
limit
on
a
clearer
point.
once
you
get
away
from
here
--
from
here
outward,
that
they
want
to
say
--
suppose
they
make
a
rule,
no
more
than
one.
i
shouldn't
think
--
i
shouldn't
think
that
congress
not
having
dealt
with
that
problem
before,
they
could
--
nobody
could
have
more
than
one
station.
i
shouldn't
think
of
that.
once
you
get
beyond
those,
is
that
a
general
--
whether
five
or
nine,
i
state
what
mr.
justice
holmes
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case
way
back
--
unfair
of
that
power
dressed
on
considerations
that
are
not
susceptible,
not
only
not
approved
but
even
a
formal
definition
or
formal
expedition.
that's
what
we're
talking
about
when
we
talk
about
expression,
maybe
that
they
know
something,
somehow
rather
out
of
the
air
because
there
are
a
lot
of
stuff
in
their
heads
that
aren't
in
my
head.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
there
is
no
limit.
there's
always
--
maybe
they
made
--
they
made
new
things,
they've
seen
the
general
gamut,
the
general
lawsuit
of
another
state
of
authority.
and
i'm
not
--
i
understood
my
judgment
to
be
true,
indifferent
from
excesses
of
power
on
their
part.
but
this
--
this
line
of
argument
is
asking
--
assuming
--
i
say,
what
you
call
power,
to
say
that
wouldn't
make
facts
that
i
think
partly
of
any
class
which
is
defined
by
them
which
as
i
have
said
couldn't
be
subject
--
couldn't
be
vulnerable
to
a
critical
examination
such
as
the
differences
there
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
let
me
try
to
reduce
in
your
(inaudible)
suppose
congress
had
written
into
this
statute,
either
three
or
nine
that
the
commission
tells
--
find
that
public
interest
to
this
is
existing
and
occur,
giving
the
permission,
you
think
classification
to
discourage
or
prohibit
undue
concentration,
may
i
present
another
--
i
can't
think
of
anything,
undue
concentration.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
determination
of
that
and
subsequently
the
justification
of
this
whole
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
assume
that's
written
into
the
statute
and
then
you
--
you
have
to
argue
whether
the
rules
formulated
by
the
commission
is
an
allowable
exercise
of
that
undefined,
and
to
my
point
of
view
undefined
view
category,
undue
concentration
and
they
get
on
five
rather
than
nine.
do
you
think
we
could
say,
well
five
--
if
nine,
yes,
five
no?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
of
course,
the
court
would
say
undue
is
not
so
indefinite
for
--
for
a
review
of
what
has
been
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
of
procedural
pleading,
administrative
procedural
or
pleadings
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
point
it
on
to
the
hearing.
suppose
you
did
not
have
these
rules
then
the
application
which
you
in
fact
has
filed
up
here
would
have
required
a
hearing
without
law,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
make
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
would
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
but
i'm
sure
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
it's
not
there,
that
this
application
would
not
have
had
to
go
through
a
hearing
for
what
rules
the
other
or
the
infraction
of
rules
other
than
the
one
that
can,
is
that
what
you're
getting
at?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
--
in
the
case
before
us,
we
haven't
got
any
--
if
this
--
if
the
refusal
to
grant
a
hearing
of
this
application,
the
court
go
off
on
conflict
with
some
other
unquestioned
rules
of
the
commission
then
we
better
not
pass
on
these
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
face
of
the
application?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
file
all
those
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
claimed
interest
all
those
data
justified,
showing
that
even
though
your
rules
maybe
general
policy
rules,
they're
not
legally
excluding
rules.
you
said
they've
just
said,
“we
want
to
come
in.”
and
you
now
say
they
haven't
found
a
lot
of
stuff
showing
that
it
enters
the
public
interest
except
for
these
rules.
and
i
suggest
that
in
the
state
of
this
authority
indicate
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
rule
are
against
the
public
interest
and
not
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
put
in
all
these
arguments
that
mr.
connelly
made
of
the
arbitrariness
and
effect
of
the
rules
with
reference
to
storer
compared
to
the
national
broadcasting,
american
broadcasting,
etcetera,
suppose
they
put
all
that
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that's
before
a
hearing
or
if
you
just
put
out
on
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
consider
that
the
commission
itself
have
--
have
obtained
revolved
rules
and
thought
that
agreeing
might
be
on
this
concentration,
if
that's
the
proper
phrase
and
five
rather
seven,
certainly,
that's
an
argumentative
area,
are
they
not?
maybe
you
want
to
show
them
in
our
case,
five
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
now,
would
that
--
would
they
be
entitled
to
show
that
or
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
should
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
nature
of
things,
that's
what
the
application
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
they
can
--
since
nobody
can
get
an
application
granted
unless
they
can
mean
the
public
interest.
and
the
man
files
an
application,
he
presumably
dependent
on
the
issue
that
this
isn't
about
the
(inaudible)
and
therefore,
he
says,
this
isn't
the
public
interest
although
you
may
have
the
general
policy
against
more
than
five.
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
clearer
way
to
(inaudible)
justice
black
then,
your
position
then
is
that
the
restriction
complied
here
as
though
congress
had
written
it
into
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
before
you
sit
down?
you
indicated
and
i
should
try
to
correct
this.
that
the
--
it
was
--
your
prediction
is
as
though
congress
had
written
in
a
specific
provision
authorizing
the
commission
to
determine
--
prohibiting
undue
concentration
of
question
subject,
however,
with
the
provision,
a
further
provision
that
this
restriction
maybe
waived
by
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
you
--
am
i
to
take
it
as
a
matter
of
cause
if
congress
had
written
in
such
a
provision,
an
application
maybe
made
for
--
to
call
a
waiver
that
a
hearing
would
be
required,
is
that
the
application?
am
i
to
take
that
as
a
matter
of
such
a
provision
within
the
--
in
the
legislation
which
requires
a
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
a
statutory
prohibition,
statutory
proscription
of
“undue
concentration”
which
is
determined
by
the
position
but
its
determination
should
be
--
should
evoke
to
a
particular
aspect
an
opportunity
to
--
ask
the
commission
to
waive.
now,
what
i'm
asking
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
you
think
such
a
statutory
--
such
a
statutory
provision
wouldn't
require
a
hearing
by
an
application
whether
if
i
want
my
application,
to
constitute
a
waiver
of
what
congress
has
generically
out
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
