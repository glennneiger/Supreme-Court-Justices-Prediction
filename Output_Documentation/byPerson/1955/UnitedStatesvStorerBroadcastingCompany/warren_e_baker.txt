mr.
warren
e.
baker
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
connelly's
answer
to
various
questions
instigated
by
a
question
from
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
the
nature
of
a
hearing
which
would
be
required
on
a
request
for
a
waiver
yesterday
points
out
the
basic
difference
between
storer
and
the
commission.
mr.
connelly
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
hearing
that
storer
is
asking
is
a
full
hearing
under
section
309
(b)
in
every
case
irrespective
of
the
showing
which
might
be
made
as
to
why
the
otherwise
binding
rule
should
not
be
applicable.
now,
this
section
309
(b)
case
hearing,
is
a
hearing
in
which
it
is
required
that
you
have
an
evidentiary
hearing
with
cross-examination
before
a
hearing
examiner
with
an
initial
decision
or
an
opportunity
to
file
exceptions
and
briefs
to
the
commission
and
a
required
oral
argument
and
the
final
decision
of
the
commission
and
an
opportunity
to
file
a
petition
for
reconsideration.
this
is
not
just
what
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
due
process
hearing
which
varies
greatly
with
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
now,
we
think
it
clear,
that
if
this
type
of
hearing
can
be
secured
upon
the
mere
request
by
filing
an
application
without
setting
forth
any
reasons
as
to
why
the
rule
should
not
be
applied
to
a
particular
person,
and
irrespective
of
the
showing
he
makes
then
the
rules
and
any
rule
which
is
subject
to
such
a
requirement
has
no
binding
effect
and
has
no
practical
value
to
an
agency.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
i'm
starting
out
on
the
ground
that
the
rule
is
valid
and
that
the
rule
itself
has
a
certain
flexibility
in
it,
just
as
did
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
which
permits
a
party
to
show
if
there
are
special
considerations
as
to
why
the
rule
should
not
be
applied
to
him.
just
as
in
the
chain
broadcasting
regulations,
the
commission
has
on
the
books
a
rule
which
permits
an
application
--
i
mean,
a
petition
for
waiver.
as
we
have
stated
in
our
reply
brief,
this
is
not
of
necessity
mean
that
the
kind
of
hearing
which
a
party
is
entitled
to
upon
a
petition
for
waiver
is
the
full
evidentiary
hearing
set
forth
in
section
309
(b).
it
is
the
kind
of
hearing,
the
kind
of
consideration
which
the
pleadings
themselves
and
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
alleged
justified.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
i
am
depending
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
i
am
depending
on
the
basis
that
the
commission,
under
its
rule
making
authority,
may
adopt
general
rules
which
in
and
of
themselves,
if
there
is
no
question
of
compliance
with
the
rules
does
not
require
a
hearing.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
but
i
am
saying
that
those
do
contemplate
that
if
there
are
extraordinary
circumstances
and
special
circumstances
because
of
the
fact
that
we
have
always
had
on
the
books
petition
for
waiver
rules,
those
special
circumstances
can
be
alleged.
and
the
consideration
of
what
kind
of
consideration
and
hearing
is
necessary
has
to
be
determined
upon
those
pleadings
and
i
might
say
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
--
they're
not
here.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
yes.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
our
rule
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
no,
sir.
our
rules
and
every
rule
we
have
on
the
books
sets
forth
a
general
proposition
subject,
of
course,
to
the
implied
and
in
fact
express
opportunity
if
there
are
special
circumstances
that
justify
a
different
treatment
in
a
particular
case
an
opportunity
to
seek
a
waiver
of
a
rule.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
we
think
that
there
is
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
yes.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
respond
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
we
do
have
that
rule.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
but
we
also
have
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
we
also
have
other
rules
which
provide
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
--
that
any
rule
may
be
waived
for
good
cause
shown.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
no,
you
cannot.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
well,
the
question
of
what
kind
of
a
hearing
they
would
have
received
would
have
depended
upon
whether
or
not
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
first
of
all,
there
was
a
factual
dispute.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
yes.
that
leads
me
to
an
illustration
which
we
have
not
put
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
it's
quite
pertinent.
first
of
all,
we
did
not
set
forth
the
kinds
of
circumstances
in
which
someone
might
obtain
a
waiver
simply
because
at
no
time
in
this
case
has
there
ever
been
a
request
for
a
waiver.
contrary
to
what
mr.
connelly
said,
the
language
in
the
decision
dismissing
his
application
which
said,
“we
will
treat
the
application
as
if
it
were
for
a
waiver,”
is
with
respect
to
a
different
rule
entirely.
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
an
application
to
waive
the
multiple
ownership
rules.
in
fact,
he
has
never
urged
that
in
his
application.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
but
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
yes,
they
may
file
such
an
application.
our
rules
provide
that
an
application
which
on
its
face
is
consistent
with
the
rule
will
not
be
accepted
or
if
it
has
been
accepted
will
be
dismissed
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
a
petition
to
amend
the
rules
or
a
petition
to
waive
the
rules.
in
such
an
event,
it
will
be
accepted
and
consideration
will
be
given
to
the
reasons
relating
to
the
waiver
and
a
determination
made
there
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
factual
matters
which
need
a
factual
hearing,
whether
or
not,
assuming
all
the
facts
they
have
submitted
any
reason
which
justifies
finding
that
in
this
case
an
exception
to
the
rule
should
be
made.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
reduces
it
to
a
rather
narrow
question
but
for
one
thing.
we
happen
to
have
a
decision
which
states
a
broad
proposition
of
law,
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which,
if
sustained,
means
that
no
rule
the
we
have
maybe
applied
to
dismiss
an
application
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
when
someone
merely
files
an
application
without
suggesting
reasons
why
in
the
particular
circumstances
it
should
be
considered
different
from
the
rule.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
is
correct.
it
is
the
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
is
correct.
the
question
is
not
only
one
of
procedure,
however,
it
is
one
of
what
kind
of
a
hearing.
respondent
here
insist
that
the
hearing
must
be
the
kind
under
309
(b).
mr.
warren
e.
baker
if
we
did
not
have
these
rules
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
--
and
the
application
which
was
filed
was
not
inconsistent
with
another
rule
which
we
have
many
of
them.
in
other
words,
if
on
its
face
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
--
it
was
consistent
with
the
rules
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
--
it
would
then
have
been
given
a
hearing.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
what
sir?
mr.
warren
e.
baker
no,
sir.
i
was
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
well,
no.
all
i
was
saying,
sir,
was
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
didn't
conflict
with
this
rule
does
not
mean
that
it
necessarily
would
go
through
a
hearing
because
it
must
be
consistent
with
all
the
rules
which
pertain
to
it.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
rules
which
would
have
prohibited
it.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
as
a
matter
of
fact,
however,
i
was
going
to
go
further
and
say
if
it
did
not
conflict
with
another
rule
in
all
probability
in
the
absence
of
this
rule
rather
than
having
to
go
through
a
hearing,
it
might
have
been
granted
without
going
though
a
hearing
on
the
basis
that
the
commission
could
find
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that's
correct.
well
not
--
it's
just
not
simply
on
the
face
of
an
application.
there's
a
great
deal
of
papers
required
to
be
filed
with
every
application,
background,
programs,
plans
and
many
things.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
well,
i
suggest
that
the
papers
they
have
filed
are
directed
to
all
other
aspects
of
the
public
interest
which
are
not
considered
in
these
rules
themselves.
i
know
of
nothing
in
which
they
have
filed
in
which
they
have
alleged
or
suggest,
that
because
of
the
particular
needs
of
miami
or
the
particular
circumstances
with
respect
to
storer's
multiple
ownership,
there
was
a
reason
why
this
broad
policy
which
the
commission
has
embodied
in
the
rule
should
not
be
applied.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
then
you
would
have
to
consider
that
with
respect
to
whether
those
circumstances
justified.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
well,
when
i
say
that
--
when
you
say
doesn't
have
to
go
to
a
hearing,
we're
talking
about
whether
or
not
there
are
facts
or
disputes,
whether
or
not,
it
could
be
resolved
on
a
mere
oral
argument
with
respect
to
the
legal
questions
or
the
policy
questions
and
whether
or
not
those
determinations
would
be
arbitrary
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
if
they
had
alleged
those
things,
i
think,
the
commission
would
have
had
to
consider
them.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
i
think
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
i
don't
believe
that
the
normal
application
is
addressed
to
those
things.
the
normal
application
and
its
one
which
was
filed
here
are
addressed
to
the
things
which
the
commission
says,
“you
must
meet
also,
such
as
what
kind
of
programs
do
you
intend
to
broadcast?
what
other
ownership
do
you
have?
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
respect
to
network
affiliation?”
and
many
of
those
facets
and
certainly
are
not
directed
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
there
are
special
circumstances
in
miami
or
special
circumstances
with
respect
to
storer
which
justify
a
waiver
of
the
rule.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
is
an
implied
tender
but
certainly
it
needs
more
than
an
implied
tender
that
this
isn't
the
public
interest
to
raise
questions
where
you
have
adopted
a
rule
which
says,
“this
is
not
in
the
public
interest.”
if
this
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
legislative,
the
quasi
legislative
rule
making
power,
a
policy
determination
that
we
should
not
permit
more
than
five
except
on
unusual
circumstances,
certainly,
someone
is
required
to
allege
those
unusual
circumstances
to
justify
the
commission
waiving
the
rules.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
is
correct.
except
for
the
fact
that
it
is
because
we
have
also
the
waiver
provision,
it
is
if
congress
had
written
it
in
into
the
statute
with
the
provision
that
in
appropriate
circumstances
we
could
waive
it.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
well,
i
can
give
you
one
right
off,
i
believe,
chief
justice.
for
example,
if
we
take
the
horrible
example
of
mr.
connelly
illustrates
in
which
out
in
the
rocky
mountain
area,
there
happens
to
be
an
assigned
channel
which
no
one
has
seen
so
far
fit
to
apply
them.
and
a
party
who
has
the
maximum
comes
in
and
said,
“here
is
a
channel,
here
is
a
need
for
service
and
no
one
else
wants
it.”
and
we,
because
we
have
multiple
ownerships,
can
absorb
what
temporary
losses
there
might
be,
justify
your
waiving
the
rule
to
give
service
to
these
people.
under
those
circumstances,
i
think,
the
commission
might
well
consider
that
this
was
exceptional
circumstance
of
justifying
waiver.
but
i
submit
that
is
not
the
fact
here.
in
no
instance
has
the
commission
had
to
turn
down
a
request
for
more
than
the
maximum
in
an
area
where
they
were
not
many
well-qualified
applicants
seeking
the
facilities.
in
the
very
case
here,
where
did
storer
apply
for
this
six
vhf.
in
miami,
florida,
where
there
were
seven
applicants
for
the
only
two
channels
that
were
available
and
every
one
of
them
was
well-qualified.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
it
might
well
be.
it
would
raise
the
question
which
the
commission
would
have
to
address
itself
to.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
if
the
commission
were
to
deny
that
the
desirability
of
providing
service
to
a
place
in
which
no
else
sought
an
--
sought
to
provide
service,
this
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
--
court
or
another
court
might
well
say.
but
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
have
a
hearing
with
respect
to
that
matter.
but
there
are
many
factual
questions
which
might
also
be
involved.
that
is
whether
or
not
other
parties
did
seek
one
there
because
applications
are
in
many
stages
of
processing.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
we
would
suggest
that
this
court
find
that
the
rule
of
law
propounded
by
the
court
below
is
incorrect,
which
says
that
the
commission
may
not
adopt
a
valid
rule
which
without
any
specific
allegation
of
reasons
for
waiver,
does
not
provide
a
full
hearing
under
section
309
(b).
we
also
would
suggest
that
because
the
court's
opinion
below
infers
that
this
is
not
a
reasonable
exercise
of
our
discretion,
that
this
is
not
a
subject
which
is
susceptible
of
being
handled
by
rule,
that
you
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
this
subject
of
multiple
ownership
is
an
appropriate
subject
to
be
handled
by
rule
making.
we
see
no
reason
why
this
court
should
pass
upon
what
circumstances
would
if
a
waiver
had
been
requested,
require
a
hearing.
we
think
that
should
be
handled
when
appropriate
circumstances
are
alleged
and
when
those
circumstances
are
found
by
the
commission
in
its
discretion
not
to
justify
a
hearing.
under
those
circumstances,
the
courts
below
will
pass
upon
whether
or
not
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
in
this
case,
i
think
it
really
makes
no
difference
what
this
court
does
with
respect
to
the
particular
application.
the
failure
of
respondent
to
appeal
a
particular
application
when
it
was
dismissed
and
the
fact
that
those
other
competing
applications
for
the
specific
channel
were
then
processed
and
going
through
to
a
grant,
which
will
take
place
in
the
near
future,
precludes
there
being
any
reliable
of
such
an
application.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
is
correct.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
is
correct.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
is
correct.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
we
believe
that
the
commission
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
i
mean
that
is
correct.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
the
question
of
whether
that
would
require
a
hearing
would
be
whether
or
not
that
is
the
kind
of
an
application
which
section
309
relates
to.
section
309
does
not
relate
to
every
application
filed
for
any
relief
with
the
commission.
it
relates
to
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
--
specific
applications.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
well,
that's
possible.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
it
wouldn't
require
the
kind
of
a
hearing
which
this
court
and
which
other
courts
will
determine
is
necessary
to
dispose
of
the
kind
of
allocations
and
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
it
would
not,
of
necessity,
require
this
complete
full
evidentiary
hearing
which
is
contemplated
by
section
309
(b)
of
the
act
and
the
administrative
procedures
act
in
sections
7
and
8.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
that
is
correct.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
yes,
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
we
do
not
think
so.
we
think
that
by
the
very
nature,
the
language
exception
or
waiver
means
--
mr.
warren
e.
baker
--
that
in
the
general
application,
a
rule
is
applied
but
that,
of
course,
if
someone
comes
along
and
alleges
there
are
special
extraordinary
circumstances
which
in
this
case
are
good
cause
for
waiving
the
general
rule,
you
may
then
waiver.
we
don't
think
those
things
are
inconsistent
anymore
that
the
rules
of
this
court
or
every
other
court
on
which
have
general
rules
as
to
respected
dates
of
filing
and
other
things
and
also
contain
provisions
which
say,
“upon
good
cause
shown,
the
court
may
waive
the
rules.”
this
is
a
traditional
concept
of
general
rule
with
exceptional
circumstances
relating
to
waiver.
mr.
warren
e.
baker
well,
i
think
that
must
be
read
with
respect
to
the
language
before
this
which
says,
that
in
any
case
in
which
someone
applies
for
more
than
the
first
station,
the
commission
will
consider
the
question
of
undue
concentration
relating
to
certain
factors.
but
in
any
event
when
it
reaches
a
certain
maximum,
the
commission
will
consider
this
as
undue
concentration.
