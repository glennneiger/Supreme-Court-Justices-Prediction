justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
i'm
--
your
argument
confuses
me
a
little.
are
you
depending
on
the
ground
that
the
pleading
is
improper
because
they
did
not
set
out
the
facts?
are
you
depending
on
the
ground
that
the
rule
is
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
are
depending,
as
i
presume,
what
you
say
now
on
the
ground
that,
not
that
the
rule
is
valid
but
that
no
man
could
get
a
--
no
company
can
get
more
than
five.
that
you're
depending
on
the
ground
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
they
can
but
they
didn't
properly
--
they
didn't
set
out
proper
facts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
justify
--
which
were
debarred
hearings
to
determine
whether
they
all
have
more
than
five?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
get
the
hearing
to
just
a
moment,
but
i
still
don't
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
rule
as
you
construe
it
was
which
said
that
no
one
can
get
more
than
five
television
stations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
--
then
as
i
gather
it,
all
these
argument
is
over
--
whether
they
have
alleged
enough
to
justify
to
call
for
a
hearing
under
a
rule
which
permits
the
--
which
--
which
it
acted
on
by
the
commission
to
grant
some
people
more
than
five
stations
and
denied
some
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
be
what
i
--
i
understand.
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
thought
you
were
depending
on
the
ground
that
you
had
a
rule.
the
commission
had
a
rule,
claimed
to
had
authority
to
enact
or
to
promulgate
it
to
the
effect
that
no
company
could
have
more
than
five
television
stations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
period.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
how
i
understood
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
that's
a
rule
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
rule,
along
with
others,
means
that
you
can't
consider
it
wrong,
as
i
gather.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
if
they
have
setup
the
facts
showing
special
circumstances,
a
circumstance
to
which
you
thought
was
special,
then
you
would've
grant
them
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
they
ought
to
have
more
than
five.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
have
gotten
more
than
five
if
they'd
setup
the
right
kind
of
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
let
me
ask
you
this
question
in
addition
because
this
is
rather
truthful
to
me.
i
have
misunderstood
your
argument.
suppose
they
would
be
denied
this
now,
could
they
file
a
new
application
asking
more
than
five,
asking
for
television
stations
and
setup
the
facts
which
would
justify
--
or
show
a
waiver?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what's
the
difference
then
and
there
from
a
case
between
ordinary
lawsuits?
where
you
haven't
quite
an
appeal
and
it
gets
up
here
and
defense
is,
well,
they
didn't
treat
this
properly,
they
should've
amended
it
but
they
didn't
do
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
--
from
what
you
say,
it's
--
maybe
i
just
didn't
understand
the
closing
of
it.
certainly,
it
seems
to
review
some
questions
of
--
about
that
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
real
issue
which
you
--
that
i
suppose
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
the
statement
on
which
the
court
decided
this
to
be
--
that
you
wrote
as
a
matter
of
law
because
you
wants
to
have
a
rule
and
i
suppose
should
they
be
allowed
to
have
a
rule
which
requires
people
to
setup
the
facts,
to
state
their
claims
of
certain
advantages
under
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
now,
what
would
you
ask
the
court
to
do
if
it
--
if
you
ask
to
reverse
this
case?
what
--
what
is
your
(inaudible)
what
i
meant
--
i
meant
for
this
reason,
if
it
--
if
as
i
understand
now,
they
can't
--
could
have
been
given
if
--
and
the
sole
consequences
between
here
as
to
whether
they
alleged
to
the
(inaudible)
are
you
asking
that
--
what
--
what
would
be
your
idea
of
the
kind
of
judgment
they
would
render
and
what
would
happen
to
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
have
that
in
this
case
so
far
as
they're
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
idea
in
which
to
decide
this
question
of
law
which
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
this
question
of
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
commission
made
a
desire,
promulgate
a
rule
that
in
the
absence
of
allegation
showing
special
circumstances
no
--
no
applicant
could
be
granted
more
than
five
television
stations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
require
here
as
to
show
or
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
show,
what
they
could,
they
came
within
the
(inaudible)
or
ambit
of
the
allowable
more
than
five
stations
under
your
special
circumstances.
