--
well
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
are
they
--
are
they
rules
in
regard
to
how

stations
there
was
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
a
network
can
only
own
fives
stations
and
the
others
must
be
leased,
is
that
it?
justice
stanley
reed
but
suppose
the
network
has
only
individual
station,
it's
not
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
begin
through
the
local
stations
rather
than
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
i
take
it
that
there
was
ample
opportunity
to
reject
the
rules
before
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
(inaudible)
suppose
grant
them
an
opportunity
between
the
draft
and
the
final
adoptions
for
the
rule-making.
justice
stanley
reed
at
this
moment,
the
rule
is
there?
justice
stanley
reed
but
there
was
a
limitation?
justice
stanley
reed
just
how
did
this
come
up,
was
there
objection
to
--
through
a
motion
for
a
hearing?
justice
stanley
reed
was
denied.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
they
must
have
been
in
different
orders
because
they
--
justice
stanley
reed
and
then
your
objection
was
the
denial
of
your
sixth
--
application
for
the
sixth
without
a
hearing?
justice
stanley
reed
objection
with
the
rules?
justice
stanley
reed
and
you
made
no
effort
to
get
a
hearing
after
the
rule
is
adopted?
justice
stanley
reed
you
have
an
application
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
for
a
sixth
station
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
and
the
rule
was
adopted
at
the
same
time
your
application
was
refused.
justice
stanley
reed
but
you
had
no
special
motion
that
you
filed
in
your
application
for
a
relief
of
the
rules?
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
i
was
thinking
that
the
broadcast
rules
were
here
before.
justice
stanley
reed
what
would
(voice
overlap)
--
what
would
be
interpreted
to
be
a
conflict
with
them
as
--
with
proper
conduct
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
stations?
justice
stanley
reed
aren't
--
aren't
there
many
rules
that
--
aren't
there
rules
that
will
say
that
you
won't
have
high
frequency,
we'll
have
stations
operating
on
the
same
frequencies.
justice
stanley
reed
--
as
--
as
impossible
under
any
circumstances.
justice
stanley
reed
the
provision
which
fixes
the
maximum
number
of
stations
which
they
proscribe.
justice
stanley
reed
that
no
matter
what
the
maximum
was
taken.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
mr.
baker
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
in
that
--
in
opinion
on
page
48,
there's
an
italicized
words
of
your
rule
that
i
take
it
to
be
(inaudible)
and
on
page
6
of
your
petition
for
rehearing
where
the
sections
of
--
are
those
consistent?
were
you
saying
the
commission
however
will
in
any
event
consider
that
there
would
be
such
a
concentration
before
if
they
were
filed?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
right.
there
were
five
stations.
and
in
section
172,
you
say
that
it's
got
a
waiver
of
that
rule.
now,
are
those
two
rules
inconsistent?
justice
stanley
reed
that
in
--
in
other
words,
will
in
any
event
if
the
words
that
are
rather
vague
on
each
and
will
in
any
event
(inaudible)
as
though
you're
taking
away
the
power
to
allow
a
waiver.
