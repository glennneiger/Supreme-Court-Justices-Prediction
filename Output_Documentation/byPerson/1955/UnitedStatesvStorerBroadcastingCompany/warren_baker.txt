mr.
warren
baker
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
federal
commission
--
federal
communication
commission
rules
which
placed
a
limit
on
the
number
of
radio
or
television
stations
in
which
any
one
party
may
have
an
interest.
normally,
these
are
called
the
multiple
ownership
rules.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
decided
that
the
communications
commission
lack
the
power
to
adopt
such
rules
because
the
hearing
requirements
of
section
309
(b)
of
the
communications
act
prevented
the
adoption
of
any
rule
which
would
require
the
rejection
without
hearing
of
an
application
by
a
citizen
for
a
lawful
use
of
an
available
frequency.
now,
we
sought
certiorari
in
this
court
because
in
our
opinion,
the
principle
of
law
annunciated
below
would
prevent
any
meaningful
utilization
of
the
commission's
rule-making
power
even
where
congress
has
specifically
directed
the
commission
to
deal
with
specific
subjects.
in
the
first
part
of
my
argument,
i
shall
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
this
broad
and
newly
formulated
principle
of
law,
which
is
found
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
is
inconsistent
with
the
communications
act
and
not
reconcilable
with
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
fact
the
court
below.
secondly,
i
will
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
contrary
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below,
the
subject
of
limiting
the
multiple
ownership
of
stations
is
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
rule-making
powers
of
this
agency
and
they
are
entirely
consistent
with
the
basic
purposes
and
objectives
of
the
communications
act.
but
before
beginning
my
argument,
however,
i'd
like
to
give
a
brief
recital
of
the
facts
and
the
history
of
this
case.
multiple
ownership
has
always
been
of
concern
to
the
federal
communications
commission.
since
its
inception,
it
has
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
in
the
public
interest
for
additional
facilities
to
be
made
available
to
parties
who
already
have
one
or
more
stations.
it
handled
am
or
standard
radio
broadcasting
for
a
long
period
of
time
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
for
a
long
period
of
time,
i
say,
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
present
rules.
nevertheless,
it
handled
the
question
of
multiple
ownership
of
fm
radio
broadcasting
stations
by
a
rule
since
1940
and
television
stations
by
a
rule
since
1941.
the
original
rule
with
respect
to
television
permitted
a
maximum
of
three
television
stations.
later,
they
were
amended
to
five.
this
was
reaffirmed
in
the
particular
rule-making,
although
since
that
time,
with
respect
to
a
certain
kind
of
television
station,
it
has
been
expanded
to
seven.
these
rules,
which
are
here
before
the
court,
stem
from
a
notice
of
proposed
rule-making
which
was
issued
by
the
federal
communications
commission
in
1948.
this
notice
of
proposed
rule-making
was
to
amend
existing
multiple
ownership
rules.
it
in
--
contemplated
the
inclusion
of
standard
radio
broadcasting,
am,
within
the
rules.
it
considered
the
question
of
different
treatment
for
minority
interest
and
because
of
various
counter
proposals
there
was
also,
involved
in
the
rule-making,
questions
as
to
making
the
number
dependent
upon
area,
geographic
area
of
power
or
coverage.
there
were
also
alternative
proposals
to
raise
the
limit
in
fm
from
six
to
seven
and
in
television
from
five
to
seven.
after
receiving
comments
and
hearing
oral
argument,
the
commission
issued
a
decision
and
order.
in
substance,
that
decision
brought
for
the
first
time
standard
radio
broadcasting
within
the
limits
of
the
rule
rather
than
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
it
raised
the
limit
with
respect
to
fm
broadcasting
from
six
to
seven
and
it
refused
to
adopt
other
alternatives
among
which
were
different
limits
for
minority
interest,
different
limits
for
area
and
power
and
the
like.
and
it
also
refused
to
raise
the
limit
in
television
from
five
to
seven,
but
it
reserved
one
specific
portion
of
that.
and
that
related
to
the
question
of
making
a
different
maximum
where
uhf
television
was
concerned
rather
than
vhf.
after
an
appeal
in
this
case,
the
commission
actually
raised
the
limit
to
seven
providing
a
maximum
of
five
vhf
were
permitted.
therefore,
it
does
not
affect
this
case
because
when
this
decision
and
order
was
issued,
storer,
the
respondent
here,
was
already
the
owner
of
five
vhf
television
stations
and
was
applying
for
a
six
vhf
television
station.
that
--
that
application,
being
inconsistent
with
the
rule,
was
dismissed.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
decision
of
the
commission
adopting
these
rules
in
accordance
with
the
administrative
procedures
act,
they
specifically
set
forth
the
basis
and
purpose
of
the
rules.
yes,
they
did
more
than
that.
they
discussed
extensively
all
of
the
alternative
proposals
and
set
forth
their
reasons
for
either
adopting
or
rejecting
those
alternative
proposals.
now,
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
the
rules,
the
commission
said
as
follows
and
this
is
found
on
page
21
of
the
record,
"the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
multiple
ownership
rules
is
to
promote
diversification
of
program
and
service
viewpoints
as
well
as
to
prevent
any
undue
concentration
of
economic
power
contrary
to
the
public
interest."
the
commission
further
stated
that
it
is
our
view
that
the
operation
of
broadcast
stations
by
a
large
group
of
diversified
licensees
will
better
serve
the
public
interest
than
the
operation
of
broadcasting
stations
by
a
small
and
limited
group
of
licensees.
now,
as
i
said
because
an
application
of
respondent
was
dismissed
as
inconsistent
with
the
rule,
respondent
filed
an
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
filed
its
appeal,
however,
from
the
specific
rules
themselves
under
section
402
(a)
of
the
communications
act
and
the
judicial
review
act
of
1950,
in
fact,
alleging
also
violation
of
the
administrative
procedures
act.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
found
that
the
limitations
on
multiple
ownership
were
invalid
because
in
its
view,
the
rules,
however
laudable
their
purpose,
conflict
with
section
309
(b)
of
the
communications
act.
therefore,
it
is
affirmed
that
any
discussion
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
must
be
preceded
by
an
examination
of
certain
other
provisions
of
the
communications
act.
now,
in
title
3
of
the
communications
act,
sections
301
through
319
deal
primarily
with
the
licensing
functions
of
the
commission.
section
309
(b),
the
particular
section
which
the
court
below
rested
its
decision,
provides
in
substance
that
where
the
commission
is
unable
to
make
--
to
make
a
finding
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
grant
an
application
without
a
hearing,
it
shall
so
notify
the
applicant
and
after
an
opportunity
to
reply
if
it
is
still
unable
to
make
it,
it
will
set
the
matter
for
hearing.
on
the
other
hand,
other
provisions
of
the
communications
act
deal
with
rule-making
power
of
the
commission.
specifically,
section
4
(i),
303
(f),
and
303
(r)
authorize
the
commission
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
thus,
the
court
below
was
dealing
with
the
scope
of
the
rule-making
power.
the
scope
of
the
rule-making
power
granted
to
the
communications
commission
to
set
forth
policies
and
standards
of
general
applicability
and
the
scope
of
the
hearing
requirements
on
a
particular
application.
a
purely
literal
reading
of
section
309
(b)
would
of
course
to
stop
the
federal
communication
commission
from
adopting
any
binding
rules.
the
court
below,
however,
aware
of
numerous
decisions
upholding
the
commission's
power
to
adopt
rules,
stated
they
were
a
few
exceptions
and
it
stated
the
very
few,
three
in
number.
first,
it
said
because
congress
itself
had
required
that
only
citizens
maybe
licensed.
an
application
of
an
alien
need
not
be
given
a
hearing
unless,
of
course,
there
is
a
factual
dispute
as
to
whether
someone
is
or
is
not
a
citizen.
similarly,
largely
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
lottery
rules,
a.b.c.
versus
u.s.
which
is
sighted
in
our
brief,
the
court
held
that
the
commission
did
not
need
to
give
a
hearing
when
the
application
was
for
an
unlawful
use.
it
also
stated
that
the
commission
did
not
have
to
give
a
hearing
when
the
frequency
applied
for
by
an
applicant
was
unavailable
because
the
commission
had
adopted
rules
which
placed
it
in
allocation
table
so
it
was
not
available
in
the
community
for
which
it
was
sought.
specifically,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
it's
formulation
of
the
law
in
reference
to
section
309
(b)
of
the
act
as
follows
and
this
is
found
in
the
record
on
page
50,
"the
statutory
provision
means
that
any
citizen
who
seeks
a
license
for
the
lawful
use
of
an
available
frequency
as
the
undoubted
right
to
a
hearing
before
his
application
maybe
rejected."
now,
respondent
did
not
choose
to
defend
the
court's
statement
of
the
law,
instead
respondents
formulates
a
different
one.
respondent
says
that
section
309
(b)
requires
a
hearing
on
an
application
whenever
congress
itself
has
not
so
defined
the
public
interest
as
to
preclude
the
grant.
we
think
both
of
these
formulations
are
incorrect.
but
certainly
under
either
statement
of
the
law,
the
commission's
rule-making
power
is
rendered
largely
meaningless.
we
believe
rather
that
the
rule-making
power
extends
generally
to
the
establishment
of
criteria
for
the
exercise
of
the
licensing
function
committed
by
congress
to
the
commission.
subject
of
course
to
the
condition
that
the
particular
exercise
of
the
rule-making
function
be
consistent
with
the
standards
and
objectives
of
the
communications
act
and
that
the
commission
is
not
required
by
section
309
(b)
to
reopen
on
a
case
to
case
basis
the
policy
judgments
which
are
embodied
in
the
rules.
we
think
the
commission
may
establish
by
appropriate
rules
the
standards
it
will
apply
in
passing
on
applications
for
broadcast
licenses
and
limit
the
hearing
to
determining
whether
those
standards
are
met.
in
this
case,
even
respondents
admit
that
if
the
rules
themselves
are
valid,
there
is
no
necessity
for
a
factual
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
comply
with
the
standards
because
there
is
no
question
to
what
the
application
itself
showed
that
they
have
the
maximum
the
rule
specifically
permits.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
therefore,
misinterpreted
the
import
of
the
decisions
which
sustained
the
commission's
exercise
of
its
rule-making
power
and
the
present
decision
is
just
not
reconcilable
to
those
previous
decisions
both
in
this
court
and
in
the
court
below.
now,
the
leading
case
on
the
rule-making
power
as
the
f.c.c.
is
one
with
respect
to
the
chain
broadcasting
regulations.
this
is
n.b.c.
versus
u.s.
found
in
319
u.s.
on
page
190.
it's
not
without
significance
but
although
this
case
was
argued
extensively
and
briefed
by
both
sides
in
the
court
below,
the
court
does
not
even
refer
to
its
meaning
in
reaching
its
conclusion.
in
the
n.b.c.
case,
this
commission
sustained
rules
of
the
federal
communications
commission
which
are
similar
in
form
to
the
multiple
ownership
rules,
since
they
state
that
no
license
will
be
issued
in
certain
conditions
under
certain
circumstances.
there
as
here
in
the
case
before
the
court,
there
were
allegations
that
the
federal
communication
commission
had
exceeded
its
rule-making
power.
there
as
here,
the
commission
set
forth
criteria
and
factors
deemed
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
which
warranted
in
and
of
themselves
a
denial
of
a
license
or
renewal
of
a
license.
there
as
here,
the
standards
did
not
involve
unlawful
uses
or
unavailability
of
frequencies.
the
standards
instead,
as
this
court
said,
were
the
commission's
particularization
of
its
conception
of
the
public
interest
and
the
basic
purpose
was
to
encourage
a
larger
and
more
effective
use
of
radio
in
the
public
interest.
mr.
warren
baker
we
think
they
are
similar
in
form
dealing
with
different
particular
criteria.
mr.
warren
baker
certain
aspects
of
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
are
almost
identical.
for
example,
in
the
chain
broadcasting
rules,
there
is
one
provision
which
says
that
the
commission
will
deem
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
a
network
to
own
two
stations
in
a
single
community
or
serving
substantially
the
same
area.
that
happens
to
be
the
first
section
of
the
multiple
ownership
rules
which
relate
to
people
other
than
the
networks.
that
perhaps
is
the
reason
that
that
particular
section
was
not
appealed
by
respondents.
but
it,
in
a
sense,
is
the
same,
is
a
mathematical
limitation
on
the
number
of
stations
in
which
a
party
may
have
an
interest.
it
happens
to
be
confined
to
a
community
rather
than
the
entire
united
states.
mr.
warren
baker
under
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
since
some
of
the
particular
rules
were
more
comprehensive
and
involves
such
matters
as
indirect
or
by
any
means
certain
relationships.
a
great
portion
of
the
time,
there
would
be
factual
matters
which
needed
to
be
disposed
of.
but
this
court
in
its
original
decision
with
respect
to
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
specifically
stated
that
these
were
not
matters
which
would
be
raised
and
were
subject
to
determination
in
the
future.
they
were
matters
which
if
there
was
to
be
a
hearing,
the
hearing
would
be
on
whether
or
not
they
complied
with
the
rules,
not
on
the
policy
judgments
which
justified
the
rules.
mr.
warren
baker
yes.
in
316,
the
decision
of
this
court
finding
that
--
mr.
warren
baker
it
--
mr.
warren
baker
it
is
true,
respondent
argues
that
this
court
in
the
decision
in
319
u.s.
did
have
some
language
which
indicated
that
these
were
not
iron
bound
but
were
flexible.
however,
we
think
that
a
reading
of
that
decision
--
mr.
warren
baker
the
commission
was
overruled
by
the
supreme
court
initially
on
that
ruling.
the
commission
contended
that
these
rules
were
not
appealable
because
of
that
matter.
this
court
in
the
first
case
held
that
they
were
appealable.
mr.
warren
baker
the
commission
did
say
that
in
its
first
position.
it
did
have
some
language
in
its
second
brief
on
the
merits
to
this
court.
i
think,
however,
that
the
question
--
mr.
warren
baker
i
think
that
the
question
of
what
the
decision
means
is
largely
a
matter
of
the
supreme
court
language.
i
think,
however,
even
in
the
language
of
the
brief
--
mr.
warren
baker
--
it
is
clear.
i
think
even
in
the
language
of
the
brief,
justice
frankfurter,
it's
clear.
but
when
the
commission
was
referring
to
the
flexibility,
it
was
not
referring
to
the
question
of
always
having
a
hearing
in
which
the
basic
policy
of
the
rule
would
be
an
issue
but
instead
if
you
read
the
specific
citation
it
was
referring
to
two
things.
one,
the
right
later
or
if
it
felt
that
it
is
a
general
matter,
these
rules
should
not
be
applied
to
seek
by
a
petition
of
rule-making
to
change
the
rules
or
two
to
seek
a
waiver
if
there
were
specific
extraordinary
circumstances
which
would
justify
it.
we
think
that
a
clear
--
a
complete
reading
of
the
language
in
your
decision
indicates
that
the
flexibility
you
are
talking
about
is
not
the
flexibility
which
means
that
the
rule
means
nothing
but
the
flexibility
if
you
can
show
extraordinary
circumstances
justifying
a
waiver
or
if
you
can
show
that
as
a
matter
of
general
exception
there
should
be
a
different
modification
of
the
rule.
mr.
warren
baker
oh,
i
think
that
basically
the
rules
are
questions
of
whether
or
not
after
lawfully
adopted
rules
are
in
effect,
whether
those
rules
require
at
every
instance
a
reopening
of
the
policy
questions
embodied
in
the
rules
to
satisfy
section
309
(b).
we
think
that
the
only
thing
that
is
necessary
is
that
there'd
be
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
specifically
laid
down
standards,
the
standards
which
have
been
adopted
through
the
lawful
exercise
of
the
quasi
legislative
powers
which
had
been
given
to
the
commission
can
or
cannot
be
met.
and
it
is
only
if
there
is
a
factual
dispute
that
a
hearing
need
be
held
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
warren
baker
well,
yes.
and
the
--
mr.
warren
baker
and
the
way
that
those
claims
should
be
exercised
is
by
seeking
to
show
that
there
are
extraordinary
circumstances
in
this
case
to
justify
a
waiver.
otherwise,
if
you
must
have
a
hearing
in
each
case,
you
have
to
go
through
the
hearing
before
you
decide
that
question.
mr.
warren
baker
well,
in
that
case
we
would
have
been
faced
with
a
question
of
what
they
alleged
for
those
extraordinary
circumstances.
they
didn't
allege
extraordinary
circumstances
here.
they
just
said
we
don't
have
to
allege
anything,
we
want
a
hearing.
mr.
warren
baker
well,
we
think
there's
a
difference
because
we
think
that
when
someone
--
someone
says
we
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
before
you
can
deny
it.
we
don't
have
to
allege
anything.
mr.
warren
baker
that
is
a
different
problem
from
saying,
we
think
there
are
certain
circumstances
that
justify
a
waiver.
we
think
that
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
our
waiver
provisions,
you
come
to
the
question
of
a
discretionary
power
to
grant
a
hearing
and
of
course
that
is
not
an
absolute
one
but
it
would
be
necessary
to
allege
matters
which
on
their
face
would
make
a
prima
facie
showing
of
extraordinary
circumstances
which
will
justify
a
grant
in
contravention
of
the
rule
and
exception
to
the
rule,
mind
you.
and
then
if
there
were
factual
disputes
with
respect
to
the
facts
you
have
alleged,
there
might
be
a
necessity
for
a
hearing
otherwise
it
wouldn't
be
granted.
i
think
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
necessity
to
seek
for
a
waiver
than
to
say
as
a
matter
of
right,
309
(b)
says
even
if
we
don't
allege
anything,
you
have
to
set
us
for
hearing.
that
is
essentially
what
the
court
below
held.
because
in
the
court's
decision,
they
held
that
we
could
not
so
elevate
this
particular
portion,
this
particular
objective
which
we
believe
is
part
and
a
very
important
part
of
the
public
interest
to
have
such
importance
that
is
of
controlling
decisional
fact
here.
we
think
another
case
--
mr.
warren
baker
well,
first
of
all,
it
would
be
necessary
as
the
test
that
i
suggested
that
we
establish,
that
the
policy
decision
we
make
relates
to
an
objective
which
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
communications
act,
then
it
--
it
is
reasonable.
mr.
warren
baker
it
may
very
well
be
that
your
decision
is
that
in
most
instances
you
would
want
to
be
very
careful
in
interfering
in
what
the
commission
might
conclude
in
expertness
was
a
valid
portion
of
the
public
interest.
we
think,
however,
that
you
would
exercise
that
judgment.
we
think
the
court
below
would.
we
think
that,
however,
congress
has
specifically
given
us
the
authority
to
do
so.
otherwise,
you
reach
a
situation
where
rule-making
itself
becomes
meaningless
because
if
as
a
matter
of
right
without
any
request
or
any
showing
of
any
specific
reason,
a
party
may
say
you
cannot
deny
an
application
no
matter
how
inconsistent
it
is
with
any
rule,
then
the
rule-making
is
meaningless.
mr.
warren
baker
no,
it
has
not,
sir.
mr.
warren
baker
we
have
not
met
that
question
because
--
mr.
warren
baker
and
it
certainly
does
--
mr.
warren
baker
i
recognize
that
that
is
a
question.
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
has
already
decided
many
cases
--
i
mean
several
cases
in
which
the
commission
has
laid
down
general
rules
in
particular
areas
and
this
court
has
them
that
the
commission
had
the
right
to
exercise
that
discretion
in
a
--
putting
it
in
a
rule.
now,
if
the
rule-making
power
is
to
have
any
validity
--
mr.
warren
baker
the
next
case
i
would
like
to
cite
is
the
felman
case.
now,
the
felman
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
was
a
rule-making
proceeding
of
the
commission
in
which
the
commission
concluded
--
mr.
warren
baker
--
the
form
of
a
rule
--
what?
it
was
--
mr.
warren
baker
yes.
it
was
affirmed
in
this
case
on
a
per
curiam
decision.
these
rules
provided
that
no
license
would
be
granted
or
renewed
where
a
transferor
had
reserved
the
right
to
--
to
reassignment
in
the
license
or
had
reserved
the
right
to
use
a
certain
--
retain
certain
amount
of
time
in
the
use
of
the
station.
the
commission's
rules
provided
that
it
would
not
grant
a
renewal
or
it
would
not
grant
a
license
to
someone
who
had
entered
into
such
a
contract
where
this
was
reserved
to
the
original
transferor.
those
rules
were
sustained
where
there
was
an
allegation
that
this
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
commission
by
a
three-judge
statutory
court.
and
it
was
appealed
as
a
matter
of
right
to
this
court
and
this
court
affirmed
those
on
a
per
curiam
decision.
an
examination
of
the
briefs
to
this
court
in
that
case
will
show
that
the
question
of
exceeding
the
power,
the
rule-making
power
of
the
commission
was
directly
an
issue
and
this
court
sustained
the
rules.
now,
respondent
suggested
that
in
felman,
it
was
merely
a
codification
of
what
section
301
required,
control
in
the
licensee
rather
than
someone
other
than
the
licensee.
this
was
not
a
mere
codification.
it
was
a
new
policy
implementing
congressional
objectives
which
prior
to
this
time
the
f.c.c.
had
permitted.
prior
to
this
time
the
commission
had
permitted
that
degree
of
retention
and
control
and
it
concluded
this
was
inconsistent
with
the
public
interest
and
laid
down
the
rule.
there
is
another
rule
and
this
was
not
in
this
court
but
in
the
court
below,
the
logansport
case
which
deals
with
the
question
of
the
commission's
power
by
rule-making
to
handle
the
questions
of
fair
and
equitable
distribution
of
facilities
amongst
the
various
states
and
communities
which
is
one
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
act
referred
to
under
public
interest.
we
see
no
rational
difference
between
our
right
to
say
that
there
will
only
be
the
following
frequencies
in
this
community
and
anyone
who
files
an
application
for
a
frequency,
which
is
not
in
our
rules
in
this
community,
is
not
permitted
the
opportunity
to
--
by
a
hearing,
establish
that
we
should
put
one
there.
that
was
what
those
rules
do.
those
were
an
exercise
of
our
rule-making
power
which
the
court
below
found
were
sustained.
turning
once
more
to
the
respondent's
formulation
of
the
law,
that
is
that
section
309
(b)
requires
a
hearing
unless
congress
itself
has
so
defined
the
public
interest
so
as
to
preclude
the
grant.
respondent
supports
the
logansport
decision
as
a
rule
prohibiting
the
licensing
of
an
applicant
who
proposes
to
disrupt
“the
equitable
distribution
of
radio
facilities.”
congress
did
not
preclude
a
grant
contrary
to
the
specific
rules
anymore
than
in
the
present
case.
those
rules
were
merely
the
commission's
interpretation
of
fair
and
equitable
distribution
of
facilities
as
part
of
what
congress
specified
as
public
interest
just
as
the
present
rules
are
the
commission's
specification
and
particularization
of
the
public
interest.
we
think
that
the
doctrine
of
the
chenery
case
in
this
court
specifically
permits
the
commission
in
its
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
make
this
policy-making
determination,
this
quasi
legislative
determination
by
rule-making
rather
than
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
if
the
commission
so
desires.
in
summary,
we
believe
that
the
real
import
of
the
court
decisions
is
that
where
the
commission
has
adopted
a
reasonable
rule
properly
related
to
considerations
of
public
interest,
the
requirements
of
section
of
309
(b)
are
met
by
a
hearing
more
appropriate
on
the
question
of
compliance
with
the
rule.
there
was
no
question
here
of
the
ability
to
comply.
i
would
like
to
go
on
and
discuss
the
second
part
of
my
argument
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
this
particular
subject
matter
of
these
rules.
the
basic
purpose,
as
stated
by
the
commission,
was
to
promote
the
diversification
of
ownership
in
order
to
maximize
the
diversification
of
program
and
service
viewpoints
as
well
as
to
prevent
any
undue
concentration
of
economic
power
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
in
expressing
that
view,
it
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
better
to
have
a
large
diversified
group
of
licensees
than
to
permit
these
limited
facilities
to
gradually
come
into
the
hands
of
a
small
group
of
licensees.
now,
there's
no
question
to
what
an
important
aspect
of
public
interest
to
be
served
by
the
commission
is
the
maintenance
of
the
field
of
broadcasting
as
one
of
free
and
extensive
competition.
the
sanders
case,
cited
in
our
brief,
establishes
that
and
we
think
here
that
the
commission
was
concerned
with
preserving
the
full
measure
of
competition,
competition
between
program
and
service
viewpoints
and
competitions
in
an
economic
sense.
the
concentration
of
station
ownership
in
the
hands
of
a
relatively
small
number
of
licensees
would,
like
the
network
abuses
in
which
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
were
designed
to
eliminate,
prevent
the
maximum
utilization
of
radio
facilities
in
the
public
interest.
this
is
a
specific
chart
found
in
section
303
(g),
generally
to
encourage
the
larger
and
more
effective
use
of
radio
in
the
public
interest.
and
we
think
there
is
no
question
for
what,
as
one
factor
in
public
interest,
the
diversification
of
program
and
service
viewpoints
has
been
held
many
times
to
be
legitimate.
it
is
a
matter
which
is
again
and
again
applied
in
comparative
cases.
as
this
court
has
stated
in
associated
press
versus
united
states
in
326
u.s.,
page
1
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
20
of
that
decision,
“the
widest
possible
dissemination
of
information
from
diverse
and
antagonistic
sources
is
essential
to
the
general
welfare
of
the
public.”
we
think
that
is
essentially
what
the
commission
means
in
attempting
to
maintain
as
great
a
diversification
of
program
and
service
viewpoints
as
possible.
we
also
think
the
other
aspect,
the
other
objective
which
it
seeks
to
obtain
through
this
rule.
the
prevention
of
undue
concentration
of
economic
power
has
been
sustained
in
many
cases,
particularly
the
n.b.c.
case
and
the
mansfield
journal
case.
and
we
cite
this
merely
to
show
that
this
is
a
factor
in
public
interest
which
the
commission
maybe
concerned
with.
the
multiple
ownership
rules
do
serve
this
related
purpose
of
effectuating
a
congressional
policy
against
an
undue
concentration
of
economic
power
in
the
hands
of
a
few
individual
members
of
the
broadcast
industry.
for
the
owner
of
numerous
stations
is
in
a
position
to
utilize
the
enhanced
bargaining
power
conferred
by
multiple
ownership
rules
in
such
ways
as
obtaining
network
affiliations
over
weaker
competitors
and
other
matters
in
this
competitive
struggle.
advantages,
mind
you,
which
flow
not
from
quality
of
service
and
program
but
from
the
pure
concentration
of
economic
power.
respondent
suggest
that
we
cannot
prevent
this
concentration
without
establishing
that
in
each
particular
instance,
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
antirust
laws.
we
submit
that
has
been
decided
in
the
mansfield
journal
case
that
the
commission
may
take
into
account
practices
which
in
its
opinion
will
be
violative
of
those
underlying
policies
which
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
antitrust
laws
particularly
in
this
field
of
limited
facilities.
this
--
these
rules
are
not
mere
restatements
of
antitrust
laws.
in
the
national
broadcasting
case,
the
regulations
were
not
there
rested
on
the
conclusion
that
various
practice
to
which
they
pertain
could
be
regarded
as
per
se
violations
of
the
antitrust
law.
the
practice
in
question
were
prescribed
not
because
they
were
found
unlawful
but
because
they
were
deemed,
like
here,
to
prevent
the
maximum
utilization
of
radio
facilities
in
the
public
interest.
we
think
the
rules
and
their
objectives
are
imminently
reasonable.
both
objectives
as
set
forth
by
the
commission
are
consistent
with
the
communications
act
and
whether
these
objectives
are
to
be
handled
by
an
ad
hoc
determination,
they
are
policy
determinations.
they're
not
matters
relating
to
a
particular
case
to
the
particular
evils
of
the
case.
these
objectives
are
general
objectives
and
if
they're
handled
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
even
the
considerations
still
would
be,
what
is
the
appropriate
limitation
for
a
general
standard
for
the
evils
to
be
prevented?
the
wider
diversifications
of
interest
are
not
matters
relating
to
a
particular
case,
they
are
objectives
for
the
entire
united
states.
now,
how
can
you
handle
this
matter
except
on
an
individual
basis?
basically,
each
time
that
an
additional
station
comes
under
the
control
or
influence
of
any
one
person,
these
two
objectives
are
thereby
to
a
degree
conflicted
with.
the
second
station
in
which
a
party
has
an
interest
diminishes
the
diversification
of
persons
in
broadcasting
and
it
increases
the
dangers
of
competitive
advantage
from
economic
power.
the
third
does
more.
the
fourth
does
more.
at
some
place,
the
commission
should
be
entitled
to
draw
a
line
and
we
think
that
the
only
equitable
way
to
treat
the
problem
is
to
draw
a
line
through
rule-making
where
all
of
the
parties
have
an
opportunity
to
comment.
for
if
these
lines
are
to
be
drawn
in
individual
cases,
only
the
particular
person
concerned
will
comment
and
have
an
opportunity
to
say
what
should
be
the
particular
line.
the
exercise
of
the
rule-making
power
in
this
particular
case
in
this
kind
of
situation
is
exactly
what
rule-making
is
for,
to
establish
standards
which
apply
for
broad
purposes
across
the
board
rather
than
try
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
to
reach
those
conclusions
which
in
any
case
would
be
the
same
kind
of
policy
determination.
we
think
that
the
commission's
experience
and
the
record
of
the
industry
furnish
a
convincing
basis
for
the
agency's
conclusion
that
there
are
enough
different
persons
in
the
united
states
capable
and
desirous
of
serving
the
needs
of
the
public
so
that
the
extremes
of
multiple
ownership
may
be
avoided
without
adversely
affecting
the
public
interest
in
securing
qualified
licenses.
if
as
weird,
the
commission
may
impose
some
limitation
on
the
multiple
ownership
of
broadcasting
stations,
it
seems
plain
that
the
selection
of
a
particular
sealing
is
a
matter
for
the
commission's
informed
and
expert
judgment.
we
think
therefore
that
this
court
should
reject
the
formulation
of
law
set
forth
in
the
decision
below.
we
think
that
it
basically
is
unsound
and
we
think
that
the
--
this
court
should
there
also
find
that
the
commission's
rules
are
inappropriate
and
reasonable
exercise
of
commission's
power
in
this
particular
subject
which
is
completely
consistent
with
the
objectives
which
the
commission
has
been
charged
with
carrying
out
by
congress
in
the
communications
act.
mr.
warren
baker
one
--
are
you
referring
--
mr.
warren
baker
--
to
the
--
mr.
warren
baker
one
portion
--
no,
sir.
one
portion
of
the
network
rules
themselves
relate
to
ownership
of
stations.
but
these
rules
apply
to
networks
like
anyone
else
in
the
sense
that
it
creates
a
maximum
number.
mr.
warren
baker
that
is
correct.
the
rest
of
them
may
not
be
leased.
they
must
be
affiliations
in
which
someone
else
owns
them
and
merely
under
an
affiliation
contract
obtains
program
from
the
networks.
mr.
warren
baker
the
control
that
--
whatever
degree
of
control
a
network
has
over
the
individual
station
relates
to
the
quality
of
its
programs
and
the
specific
contracts
which
must
be
in
accord
with
the
network
rules.
if
they
are
not
in
accord
with
the
network
rules
that
we
have
adopted,
if
they
have
provisions
which
conflict
with
those,
the
station's
license
itself
is
in
jeopardy.
mr.
warren
baker
that
is
what
the
networks
do,
yes,
because
that
is
where
we
have
the
power
with
rules
relating
to
the
stations
themselves.
what
i
do
wish
to
reiterate
that
one
of
the
rules
in
the
network
case
which
was
reaffirmed
--
i
mean
which
is
affirmed
by
this
court
did
prohibit
a
form
of
multiple
ownership.
it
merely
was
confined
to
a
locality
as
contrasted
to
the
united
states.
and
one
of
the
questions
which
the
respondent
raises
here
is
that
the
commission
should
have
varied
its
limits
within
these
two
limits,
it
should
have
had
wider
geographical
areas
in
which
it
had
a
different
standard
to
take
into
account
certain
variables.
we
think
that
the
commission
has
satisfactorily
explained
in
its
decision
why
it
did
not
choose
to
adopt
all
of
the
variables
which
might
be
put
into
a
rule.
we
do
not
think
that
just
because
you
can
pick
out
some
specific
case
in
which
in
your
opinion
there
is
a
lesser
evil
than
the
rule
prohibited
that
that
thereby
renders
the
rule
itself
invalid.
if
that
were
true,
wage
and
hour,
maximums
for
children,
speed
laws
and
the
like
would
also
be
invalid
because
certainly
they
do
not
fit
the
particular
case
with
respect
to
all
the
variable
factors
which
anyone
can
dream
up.
we
think
this
do
carry
out
a
legitimate
objective
of
the
communications
act
that
they
therefore
should
be
sustained.
thank
you.
