mr.
albert
r.
connelly
your
honors,
the
commission's
argument
in
this
case
depends
very
largely
upon
it's
assertion
that
it
has
been
entrusted
with
the
congress
with
broad,
expansive
and
substantive
rule-making
powers.
almost
as
if
to
say
that
the
commission
is
authorized
to
adopt
a
rule
on
any
matter
affecting
communications
on
which
the
congress
could
itself
have
legislated.
that
argument
completely
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
rule-making
power
is
purely
incidental
to
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act.
each
of
the
sections
of
the
act
which
confers
rule-making
power,
and
they
are
set
forth
at
page
5
of
the
respondent's
brief,
is
itself
strictly
limited.
it
authorizes
the
adoption
of
a
rule
which
first
must
be
not
inconsistent
with
the
communications
act.
and
second,
which
must
be
necessary,
mind
you
not
necessary
or
desirable,
necessary
to
prevent
interference
between
stations
or
otherwise
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
and
the
question
therefore
here
is
whether
these
numerical
prescription
rules
are
consistent
with
the
act
and
whether
they
are
necessary
to
carry
out
its
provisions.
now,
section
309
(b)
which
is
the
section
dealing
with
applications
for
license,
provides
that
if
the
commission
is
unable
to
find
without
a
hearing
that
the
grant
of
a
license
would
serve
the
public
interest,
then
it
shall
formally
designate
the
application
for
hearing
on
the
grounds
or
reasons
then
obtained.
that,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
is
a
very
vital
section
of
the
act
because
it
is
only
the
physical
limitation
on
the
available
facilities
which
provides
any
justification
for
impairing
the
otherwise
equal
rights
of
citizens
to
access
to
means
of
communication.
and
this
court
has
held
in
the
ashbacker
case,
the
hearing
contemplated
by
309
(b)
is
not
a
matter
of
discretion,
it's
a
matter
of
right
and
this
court
has
also
held
that
a
denial
of
a
statutory
right,
the
hearing
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
now,
what
do
these
rules
here
do?
those
rules
deny
a
hearing
under
309
(b)
to
anyone
holding
interests
in
five
tv
stations.
there
isn't
any
question
about
the
interpretation
of
that
phrase
because
it
has
been
interpreted
by
the
commission,
as
mr.
baker
has
pointed
out,
in
the
application
filed
by
storer
and
indeed
in
others
where
applications
by
persons
owning
five
tv
stations
are
automatically
dismissed
without
a
hearing.
accordingly,
on
their
face,
these
rules
are
inconsistent
with
section
309
(b)
and
there
is
no
showing
whatever
that
they
are
necessary
to
carry
out
any
other
provision
of
the
act.
we
conceded
in
the
court
below
and
concede
here
that
that
statutory
right
to
hearing
is
subject
to
an
implied
qualification
but
only
where
the
congress
itself
has
declared
or
determined
the
public
interest
so
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
a
grant
of
a
license.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
an
application
by
an
alien,
they
don't
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
a
grant
to
an
alien
is
in
the
public
interest
because
section
310
of
the
act
says
it
isn't.
similarly,
an
application
in
conflict
with
the
nationwide
allocation
of
frequency
because
the
commission
is
required
by
another
section
of
the
act,
307
(b),
"the
substitute
for
the
test
through
the
public
interest
in
the
individual
application,
the
test
of
fair,
efficient
and
equitable
distribution
of
frequencies
among
the
several
states
and
communities."
and
that
was
the
situation
which
the
court
below
dealt
with
in
the
logansport
case
referred
to
by
mr.
baker.
similarly,
an
application
by
a
person
on
the
contract
to
transfer
control
of
the
station
to
a
non-licensee
in
violation
of
section
301
of
the
act,
that
was
the
situation
involved
in
the
felman
case
here
or
an
application
by
someone
who
proposes
to
conduct
a
lottery
in
violation
of
the
federal
criminal
code,
the
situation
that
your
honors
dealt
with
in
the
american
broadcasting
case.
in
other
words,
where
a
federal
statute
has
determined
the
public
interest,
a
hearing
is
not
required
because
the
statute
bars
the
finding,
prerequisite
to
the
issuance
of
a
license
that
it
would
be
in
the
public
interest
to
grant
it.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
waiver
provision
was
--
presents
a
separate
problem,
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
that
the
decision
to
waive
or
not
to
waive
a
rule
as
interpreted
by
the
commission
does
not
require
a
hearing.
in
other
words,
if
it
were
phrased
in
terms
of
waiver,
that
would
be
a
deprivation
of
our
statutory
right
to
a
hearing,
not
merely
to
file
an
application
and
have
the
commission
reject
it.
but
a
hearing
on
which
we
would
have
the
opportunity
to
show,
but
notwithstanding,
the
policies
and
rules
of
the
commission
that
in
this
situation
it
was
in
fact
in
the
public
interest
to
grant
us
a
license.
now,
if
that
objective
were
accomplished,
i
wouldn't
care
how
the
--
how
the
rules
or
how
--
how
the
phraseology
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
nothing
less
than
a
hearing
would
satisfy
the
statute.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
an
oral
hearing.
an
--
an
opportunity
to
submit
evidence
--
an
opportunity
to
submit
evidence,
not
merely
an
application.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
this
court
has
determined
that
in
--
that
where
a
statute
grants
the
right
to
a
hearing,
nothing
less
than
a
full
hearing
will
satisfy
that
requirement.
that's
in
the
federal
radio
commission
against
nelson
brothers
where
the
mere
opportunity
to
file
briefs
and
oral
arguments
was
held
not
to
satisfy
the
statutory
requirement
of
the
hearing.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
because
in
this
area,
the
congress
has
not,
in
terms
of
individual
applications,
purported
to
declare
the
public
interest.
it
has
said
that
that
must
be
determined
by
the
commission
and
a
hearing.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
would
think
under
the
interpretation
to
which
thus
far
been
given
that
that
would
be
required
in
this
particular
case.
i
--
i
wanted
to
remind
your
honors
of
the
statement
you
made
in
american
broadcasting
company
on
the
subject
of
this
implied
qualification.
you
said
there
that
the
public
interest,
convenience
or
necessity
standard
for
the
issuance
of
licenses
would
seem
to
imply
a
requirement
that
the
applicant
be
law
abiding.
in
that
case
referring
to
the
lottery
that
the
applicant
there
propose
to
conduct.
now,
there
isn't
any
such
case
here,
although
the
commission
has
sought
to
justify
these
rules
on
the
basis
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
concedes
that
the
acquisition
of
the
ownership,
which
is
proscribed
by
these
rules,
is
not
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
or
indeed
of
any
other
laws.
and
our
position
is
that
where
the
congress
has
not
itself
determine
the
public
interest
factor
then
the
commission
must
determine
on
the
basis
of
all
11
factors.
i'd
like
to
make
it
quite
clear
in
view
of
what
mr.
baker
stated
that
there
isn't
any
question
here
of
the
commission's
power
to
consider
multiple
ownership
as
a
factor
nor
indeed
is
there
any
question
of
its
power
to
adopt
policy
declarations
with
reference
to
multiple
ownership.
indeed,
they
have
done
just
that
in
provisions
of
these
multiple
ownership
rules
which
are
not
here
under
attack.
and
at
page
29
of
the
record,
this
tv
rule
appears
in
the
second
subdivision,
provision
that
no
license
shall
be
granted
if
the
grant
of
such
license
would
result
in
a
concentration
of
control
of
television
broadcasting
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
public
interest
convenience
and
necessity.
there
can
be
no
objection
to
that.
in
the
second
sentence,
this
i
do
ask
your
honors'
particular
attention
to
that
these
deals
with
the
situation
prior
to
the
point
at
which
the
magic
number
has
been
reached
to
five.
in
determining
whether
there
is
such
a
concentration
of
control,
consideration
will
be
given
to
the
facts
of
each
case
with
particular
reference
to
such
factors
as
the
size,
extent
and
location
of
areas
served,
the
number
of
people
served
and
the
extent
of
other
competitive
service
to
the
areas
to
areas
in
question.
those
are
perfectly
proper
declarations
of
policy
on
the
part
of
the
commission,
but
the
commission
cannot,
as
it
has
here,
ignore
its
statutory
duty
to
grant
a
hearing
on
all
relevant
factors
and
not
merely
the
matter
of
multiple
ownership
to
determine
public
interest.
the
court
below
stated,
as
mr.
baker
has
already
noted,
the
statutory
provision,
that
is
to
say
309
(b),
means
that
any
citizen
who
seeks
a
license
for
the
lawful
use
of
an
available
frequency
as
the
undoubted
right
to
a
hearing
before
his
application
may
be
rejected.
and
the
commission
suggests
that
our
position
here
in
some
respects
or
in
some
manner
differs
from
that
statement
of
the
law
by
the
court
below.
i
submit
that
it
does
not.
the
court
below
was
merely
particularizing
the
general
principle
since
congress
has
determined
the
public
interest
with
reference
to
a
license
to
an
area,
has
determined
the
public
interest
with
reference
to
other
unlawful
use,
has
determined
the
procedure
for
determining
nationwide
allocation
of
frequencies
whether
there
are
other
matters
that
may
come
within
the
general
principle
is
not
here
for
consideration,
those
are
the
only
factors
which
have
been
suggested
up
to
this
time.
the
commission's
apparent
reliance
on
the
chain
broadcasting
regulations
and
the
cases
thereunder,
i
find
very
difficult
to
understand.
in
the
order,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
recalled
in
the
order
adopting
those
regulations.
initially,
the
commission
stated,
the
quotation
is
at
page
17
of
our
brief,
“the
applicant's
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
question
whether
he
does
in
fact
propose
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
is
fully
preserved.
the
regulations
we
are
adopting
are
nothing
more
than
the
expression
of
the
general
policy
we
will
follow
in
exercising
our
licensing
power.
the
formulation
of
a
regulation
in
general
terms
is
an
important
aid
to
consistency
and
predictability.
it
does
not
prejudice
any
rights
of
the
applicant."
i
think
that
may
be
contrasted
with
the
statement
your
honors
have
just
heard
that
if
a
hearing
is
required
through
regulations
or
the
power
to
make
rules
is
meaningless.
now,
in
that
situation
in
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
case,
316
u.s.,
the
commission
opposed
judicial
review
of
those
regulations
because
they
said
they
--
that
they
were
only
announcements
of
policy.
this
court
granted
review
not
on
the
ground
that
the
regulations
denied
a
hearing,
but
that
the
right
to
appeal
from
a
denial
of
an
application
after
a
hearing
was
not
an
adequate
remedy
to
test
the
problems
created
by
those
rules.
there
wasn't
any
question
raised
by
any
party
for
that
proceeding
as
to
the
applicants
right
to
a
hearing
under
309
(b),
as
stated
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
support
of
the
commission's
position
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
noted
that
the
statute
provide
an
administrative
procedure
under
which
the
commission
must
make
a
specific
determination
in
each
case
whether
the
public
interest
would
be
served
by
granting
the
particular
application.
and
after
this
court
had
granted
that
review
in
the
c.b.s.
case
and
the
chain
broadcasting
regulations
came
before
you
in
the
n.b.c.
case,
the
commission
submitted
in
its
brief
in
that
case
which
is
quoted
at
page
18
of
our
brief
said,
“in
the
language
of
309
(b),
each
applicant,
unless
his
application
is
granted
without
a
hearing,
is
entitled
to
a
hearing,"
now,
i
mind
you,
"not
only
that
he
may
have
an
opportunity
to
show
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
grant
of
an
application
under
the
established
policies
of
the
commission,
but
also
that
he
may
show
if
necessary
that
such
policies
are
not
appropriate
in
his
particular
situation."
and
it
was
against
that
background
that
this
court
announced
in
the
n.b.c.
case
itself.
the
commission
did
not
bind
itself
inflexibly
to
the
licensing
policies.
in
each
case
that
comes
before
it,
the
commission
must
still
exercise
an
ultimate
judgment
whether
the
grant
of
that
license
would
serve
the
public
interest
convenience
or
necessity.
a
very
similar
conclusion
was
reached
by
the
court
below
in
the
stahlman
case,
a
case
involving
a
subpoena
issued
in
a
newspaper
investigation.
the
court
there
said
if
in
this
case
it
had
been
made
to
appear
as
counsel
for
the
commission
--
the
counsel
for
appellant
insists
that
the
commission's
investigation
was
solely
for
the
purpose
and
the
consideration
or
adoption
of
a
hard
or
fast
rule
as
the
result
of
which
newspaper
owners
may
be
placed
in
a
proscribed
class
and
thereby
made
ineligible
to
receive
or
apply
--
apply
or
receive
a
license,
we
should
be
obliged
to
declare
that
such
an
investigation
would
be
wholly
outside
of
and
beyond
any
of
the
powers
with
which
congress
has
clothed
the
commission.
the
numerical
prescription
rules
here
in
question
place
the
owners
at
interests
in
specified
numbers
of
stations
in
a
proscribed
class
and
make
them
ineligible
to
receive
licenses.
under
the
commission's
position
in
this
case,
i
submit
to
your
honors,
the
commission
could
equally
adopt
rules
precluding
licenses
to
newspaper
owners
without
a
hearing.
because
certainly,
the
ownership
of
other
mass
media
of
communication
is
at
least
as
much
related
to
the
avowed
purposes
of
these
rules
as
is
the
ownership
of
other
television
stations.
we
submit
that
the
court
below
correctly
held
that
there
was
no
such
power
conferred
upon
the
commission
to
do
that
in
the
absence
of
a
hearing.
the
numerical
prescription
rules
here
in
question
are
invalid
not
only
because
they
denied
a
hearing
under
309
(b)
but
because
they
are
arbitrary,
in
that,
they
exclude
required
consideration
of
relevant
facts
and
in
that,
their
basis
is
not
adequately
disclosed.
mr.
albert

notice
of
rule-making
was
announced
in
1948.
hearings
--
or
there
wasn't
any
evidence
but
his
oral
statements
were
taken
in
1949.
and
then
nothing
happened
until
late
1953
when
these
multiple
ownership
rules
were
announced.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
no,
sir.
the
notice
of
rule-making
contained
proposed
rules
and
the
statements
were
accepted.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
it
had
a
version
of
it.
it
was
changed
between
the
proposed
and
the
final.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
but
there
was
a
limitation
so
far
as
the
numerical
limitation
is
concerned
and
indeed
as
the
record
shows,
the
industry
generally
was
represented
in
protest
of
the
proposed
rules
at
this
time.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
--
the
review
proceeding
was
taken
directly
after
the
final
promulgation
of
the
rule.
the
hearing
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
--
took
place
back
at
1949,
but
the
rule
itself
was
not
promulgated
until
1953,
effective
1954
and
the
review
proceeding
started
immediately
thereafter.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
no,
sir.
our
application
for
a
--
a
sixth
television
station
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
--
was
denied
simultaneously
with
the
promulgation
of
these
rules.
and
then
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
they're
in
different
orders.
that's
correct.
but
the
--
the
second
order
which
is
in
the
record.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
we
--
yes.
we
did
not
take
any
appeal
from
that.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
within
that
--
yes,
sir.
the
other
way
around.
we're
taking
our
--
our
objection
under
302
to
the
rules
themselves
because
so
long
as
the
rule
stand
--
stands
then
the
disposition
of
our
application
for
the
sixth
television
station
is
automatic.
because
the
commission
says,
“the
rule
disposes
of
it.
you're
not
entitled
to
a
hearing."
so,
we
are
directly
attacking
the
rule
itself
because
the
consequences
that
flow
from
the
rule.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
don't
quite
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
it
was
denied
without
a
hearing
because
of
the
rules.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
well,
sir,
in
--
i
don't
know
about
the
--
the
procedure
about
a
special
motion.
but
in
its
decision
denying
the
application
of
storer
for
the
sixth
station,
the
commission
stated
in
so
many
words
that
it
would
treat
that
application
as
an
application
for
a
waiver
of
the
rules
and
notwithstanding
that,
denied
it
without
a
hearing.
does
your
honor
desire
me
to
suspend
at
that
point?
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
--
the
rules
that
are
here
in
question
was
promulgated
under
an
order
which
recites
that
they
are
designed
to
implement
the
congressional
policy
against
monopoly,
enunciated
specifically
in
sections
311
and
313
of
the
communications
act.
and
the
commission
suggests
that
there
are
two
aspects
to
that
policy,
first,
diversification
of
program
and
service
viewpoint,
and
secondly,
prevention
of
undue
concentration
of
economic
power.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
your
honors,
in
answer
to
a
question
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
concerning
the
scope
of
the
hearing
required
by
section
309
(b)
of
the
act,
i
misspoke
myself
in
referring
the
court
to
the
nelson
brothers
case,
the
case
which
i
intended
to
refer
to
is
one
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief,
commission
against
national
broadcasting
company
koa
319
u.s.
239.
in
that
case,
there
was
an
application
by
a
boston
station
for
an
increase
in
power,
the
effect
of
which
if
granted
would
be
to
constitute
an
interference
with
the
denver
station
koa
and
to
that
extent
a
modification
of
the
koa
clear
channel
license.
and
under
then
section
312
(b)
of
the
act
a
modification
of
license
could
not
be
effected
without
affording
the
licensee
an
opportunity
to
show
cause
why
it
should
not
be
modified.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
there
were
general
rules
from
--
which
excluded
the
application
or
the
consideration
of
koa's
application
to
intervene
in
that
hearing.
this
court
held
that
under
312
(b)
the
commission
could
not
preclude
koa
from
becoming
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
no,
sir.
i
--
i
refer
to
the
case
only
to
indicate
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
hearing
required
by
309.
and
the
court
--
this
court
held
that
--
that
koa
was
entitled
to
participate
in
that
hearing,
to
offer
evidence
and
to
exercise
the
other
rights
of
the
party,
your
honor
dissented
from
that
decision
on
the
ground
that
312
(b)
did
not
require
making
koa
a
party.
but
there
was
no
dissent
from
the
view
at
the
hearing
contemplated
by
section
309
and
other
sections
of
the
act
contemplated
and
required
that
the
parties
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
introduce
evidence
and
that
merely
argument,
the
submission
of
briefs
was
not
compliance
with
the
statutory
requirement
of
the
hearing.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
it
is
that
kind
of
hearing
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
no.
my
--
my
reference
to
that
case
was
with
specific
reference.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
well,
but
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
question
that
i
put
--
that
you
just
put,
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
is
--
is
meant
very
clearly
by
the
proposition
that
the
act
itself
requires
a
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
public
interest
in
the
grant
of
the
application.
and
therefore,
unless
that
statutory
provision
is
subject
to
some
implied
qualification
which
has
not
yet
been
read
into,
then
the
applicant
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
with
all
of
the
consequences
of
that
hearing
to
show
what
the
public
interest
is.
that
koa
case
is
an
interest
in
another
rather
collateral
respect,
in
that,
it
points
out
the
congressional
interest.
in
the
conduct
of
those
hearings
by
the
commission
itself
in
order
that
it
may
keep
abreast
of
a
dynamic
and
developing
industry
in
radio
broadcasting
which
that
congress
quite
clearly
considered
and
properly
considered
could
not
be
determinative
of
the
public
interest
on
any
static
basis.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
can
see
that
the
limits
of
--
of
the
commission's
rule
making
power
are
those
which
are
set
forth
in
the
only
sections
of
the
act
which
empowers
it
to
--
to
adopt
rules.
number
one,
that
the
rule
must
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
communications
act.
number
two,
that
it
must
be
necessary
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
i
have
not
attempted,
if
your
honor
pleases
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
have
not
attempted
to
suggest
or
attempt
to
define
here
all
of
the
situations
in
which
the
commission
may
properly
adopt
rules
because
i
apprehend
that
that
question
is
not
before
this
court.
i
simply
state
here
that
the
particular
rules
under
attack,
the
numerical
proscription
rules
are
inconsistent
by
their
very
terms
that
section
309
(b)
of
the
act.
and
that
they
have
not
been
shown
to
be
necessary
to
carry
out
any
other
provision
of
the
act.
i
have
also
pointed
out
that
in
the
only
cases
which
it
thus
far
been
decided
where
any
question
is
raised
as
to
that
right
to
a
hearing
that
that
--
those
situations
are
completely
answered
by
the
fact
that
in
those
cases
that
congress
itself
has
declared
what
the
public
interest
is,
as
for
example,
a
grant
of
a
license
to
an
alien
so
that
the
hearing
would
be
a
futile
gesture
because
congress
hasn't
left
to
the
commission
the
determination
of
the
public
interest
in
that
case.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
well,
they
would
be
violative
of
any
law,
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
i
can
give
you
an
illustration
precisely
along
that
line
which
is
section
311
of
the
act
which
prohibits
the
commission
from
granting
a
license
to
anyone
whose
license
has
been
revoked
under
section
313
of
the
act
in
an
anti-trust
proceeding
by
a
court.
now,
that's
a
situation
where
quite
clearly
a
hearing,
if
the
facts
were
admitted
about
the
revocation
of
the
license,
there
couldn't
be
any
--
there
wasn't
--
wouldn't
be
any
question
of
public
interest
open
for
determination
by
the
commission
because
the
congress
itself
has
said
that
that
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
think
not,
sir.
i
think
not,
sir,
because
the
commission
itself
concedes
that
the
number,
numerical
ownership,
which
the
rules
prescribe,
are
not
in
violation
of
any
law.
and
once
that
concession
has
been
made
and
indeed
there
can't
be
any
question
about
the
mere
ownership
of
five
or
six
nations
doesn't
violate
the
anti-trust
laws.
once
that
concession
has
been
made,
then
there
is
no
showing
which
would
deprive,
operate
to
deprive
the
applicant
of
the
right
to
a
hearing
under
309
(b)
to
determine
what
the
public
interest
is
in
that
question
of
ownership.
if
it
were
violative
of
the
anti-trust
law,
then,
i
would
have
no
question
at
all,
as
your
honor
had
suggested.
clearly
they
could
adopt
the
rule
which
prohibited
a
license
under
those
circumstances.
now,
your
honors,
at
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
not
necessarily.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
--
no
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
no,
i
think
not,
sir.
the
lottery
rules,
for
example,
are
not
to
the
lottery,
the
prohibition
against
lotteries
and
not
contained
in
the
federal
communications
act.
that's
in
the
criminal
code.
and
yet
this
court
held
it
proper
to
adopt
rules
excluding
a
license
to
one
who
proposed
to
operate
in
violation
of
that
section
of
the
criminal
code.
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
it
isn't
as
narrow
a
position
as
that.
i
say
where
the
congress
has
determined
the
public
interest
in
question
either
in
the
communications
act
or
elsewhere,
then
it
has
taken
away
from
the
commission
the
power
to
make
that
determination
of
public
interest
because
the
congress
has
itself
determined
the
public
interest.
but
i
do
not
restrict
my
argument
merely
to
the
specific
provisions
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
for
the
most
part
did
involve
problems
of
conflict
with
the
communications
act
itself.
as
for
example
question
of
operation
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes.
for
example
one
such
rule
in
the
chain
broadcasting
rules
had
to
do
with
the
control
exercise
by
a
non-licensee
over
the
operation
of
the
station
and
that
involves
a
violation
of
section
301
of
the
act.
that
while
it
is
true
that
those
chain
broadcasting
regulations
did
involve
that
type
of
conflict
with
the
communications
act,
i
--
i
do
not
suggest
to
your
honors
that
that
is
the
only
situation
in
which
the
congress
could
have
declared
or
has
declared
the
public
interest.
now
to
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
as
--
as
i
call
your
honors'
attention
yesterday,
there
is
another
section
of
the
act,
307
(b)
which
requires
the
commission
to
allocate
frequencies
on
a
nationwide
basis
to
provide
efficient,
fair,
and
equitable
distribution
among
the
states
and
communities.
now,
that
is
a
provision
of
the
act
which
admittedly
involves
an
inconsistency
with
the
public
interest
involved
in
an
individual
application
because
if
the
commission
has
carried
out
that
mandate
of
the
congress
and
has
allocated
the
frequencies
so
that
there
isn't
a
frequency
available
for
an
individual
community
or
a
frequency
of
a
particular
kind
available
to
individual
community,
then
it
is
not
in
a
position
to
determine
the
public
interest
in
an
application
by
me
for
example
for
a
frequency
that
just
doesn't
exist.
now
what
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
where
--
where
the
congress
has
not
itself
done
it
and
(inaudible)
and
the
congress
hasn't
done
that.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
that
is
on
the
--
on
the
one
branch
of
the
argument.
they
can't
put
us,
they
can't
put
newspaper
owners,
they
can't
put
lawyers,
they
can't
put
anybody
in
a
proscribed
class
ineligible
to
receive
licenses
without
regard
to
the
facts
as
the
public
interest
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
we
are
attacking
this
provision
of
the
rule
as
being
an
invalid
rule
under
the
commission's
powers.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
no
matter
what
the
maximum
fix,
yes.
that
leads
me
directly
into
--
into
the
second
branch
of
the
argument.
because
it
is
our
contention
here
as
it
was
in
the
court
below
that
these
numerical
proscription
rules
are
invalid
not
only
because
they
deny
the
hearing
under
section
309
(b)
but
because
they
are
arbitrary
in
that
they
exclude
required
consideration
of
relevant
factors
and
their
basis
is
not
adequately
disclosed.
now,
i
pointed
out
to
your
honors
yesterday
that
the
order
promulgating
these
rules
was
founded
upon
the
anti-trust
sections
of
the
communications
act
and
that
the
commission
had
had
ceased
two
aspects
of
that,
the
program
diversification
policy
and
the
policy
preventing
undue
concentration
of
economic
control.
i
think
i
also
pointed
out
that
the
anti-trust
provisions
of
the
communications
act
merely
declare
applicable
to
radio,
all
the
laws
of
the
united
states
relating
to
unlawful
restraints
and
monopolies
and
the
combinations,
contracts
or
agreements
in
restraint
of
trade.
in
other
words,
there
isn't
any
legislation,
anti-trust
legislation
applicable
to
radio
which
is
not
also
applicable
to
all
industry.
and
the
anti-trust
laws,
both
statutory
and
as
they
have
been
construed
by
the
court
do
not
proscribe
any
acquisition
except
upon
the
basis
of
actual
or
potential
effect
upon
competition.
and
determination
of
the
effect
upon
competition
requires
consideration
of
a
variety
of
factors,
requires
consideration
of
the
purpose
of
the
acquisition.
the
size
and
location
of
the
acquiring
interest
and
of
the
acquired
interest,
the
existence
and
strength
of
competitors
in
the
market
affected
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
columbia
steel
case.
we
look
to
the
percentage
of
business
control,
the
strength
of
the
remaining
competition
whether
the
action
springs
from
business
requirements
or
purpose
to
monopolize
the
probable
development
of
the
industry,
consumer
demands,
and
other
characteristics
of
the
market.
these
rules
make
one
factor,
multiple
ownership
controlling
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
relevant
factors,
although
the
multiple
ownership
rules
themselves
in
the
sections
immediately
preceding
the
numerical
proscription
hereunder
attack
expressly
recognize
differences
as
the
rule
state
in
size,
extent,
and
location
of
areas
served,
differences
in
numbers
of
people
served,
differences
in
the
extent
of
other
competitive
service
to
the
areas
in
question.
i
ask
your
honors
to
consider
these
numerical
proscription
rules
in
the
light
of
those
three
factors.
first,
size,
extent,
and
location
of
areas
served.
these
rules
do
not
take
that
factor
into
account
at
all.
indeed,
they
create
an
arbitrary
and
false
presumption
that
a
t.v.
station
in
say,
butte,
montana
is
to
be
equated
because
it's
one
with
the
t.v.
station
in
new
york
city.
the
rules
ignore
completely
the
factor
of
the
number
of
people
served.
now,
in
that
connection,
your
honor,
there
is
a
footnote
reference
in
the
government's
reply
brief
at
page
14
--
at
page
14,
referring
presumably
in
an
effort
to
show
the
salutary
effect
of
these
rules
in
preventing
undue
expansion
of
storer
to
the
fact
that
the
metropolitan
areas
served
by
storer's
television
stations
have
a
population
of
some
seven
million
persons.
now,
that
statistic
is
not
in
the
record.
it
is
not
--
it
has
not
been
referred
to
previously
in
this
proceeding,
but
it
is
based
upon
the
1950
census
of
the
metropolitan
areas
which
are,
in
fact,
served
by
storer's
t.v.
station.
and
therefore,
i
think
it
appropriate
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention,
using
the
same
1950
census
figures,
the
fact
that
there
are
other
multiple
owners
operating
under
exactly
the
same
multiple
ownership
rules
serving
vastly
larger
populations.
dumont
for
example,
14
million,
general
teleradio,
20
million,
columbia
broadcasting,
23
million,
national
broadcasting,
27
million,
american
broadcasting,
28
million.
i
think
that
illustrates
one
of
the
points
of
attack
here.
because
if
for
example,
american
broadcasting
gave
up
one
of
its
five
t.v.
stations,
say
in
san
francisco,
with
a
metropolitan
population
of
approximately
two
million,
thereby
reducing
its
population
statistic
to
26
million,
it
would
be
eligible
to
receive
a
license
for
a
new
station
for
which
storer,
with
its
seven
million
statistic
would
be
ineligible
to
receive.
the
third
factor
and
perhaps
the
most
important
in
the
light
of
the
--
of
our
purposes
of
these
rules,
the
extent
of
other
competitive
service
to
the
areas
in
question,
a
factor
which
is
totally
disregarded
by
these
numerical
proscription
rules
that
points
out
the
fact
that
they
are
not
at
all
related
to
the
alleged
policy,
i
shouldn't
say
alleged
policy,
to
the
policy
of
program
diversification
which
is
alleged
as
a
basis
for
the
rules.
because
they
preclude
consideration
of
the
view
points
and
programs
available
in
any
given
area
that
they
operate
and
apply
only
the
stations
serving
different
areas.
let
me
illustrate
that.
the
service
area
of
the
t.v.
station
can
be
measured
by
a
radius
of
approximately
60
miles
maximum.
an
application
is
made
for
a
license
to
operate
a
station
in
miami,
florida.
the
fact
that
an
applicant
has
an
interest
in
a
station,
a
t.v.
station
in
detroit,
michigan,
and
have
no
possible
relationship,
the
program
diversification
either
in
miami
or
in
detroit
or
in
anywhere
else.
these
rules
exclude
a
multiple
owner
from
areas
in
which
there
are
more
facilities
when
there
are
applicants.
indeed,
by
their
expressed
terms,
they
would
exclude
an
otherwise
qualified
applicant,
a
multiple
owner,
in
an
area
not
served
by
any
existing
facility,
even
if
there
were
not
any
other
applicant
for
facility
there.
if
those
factors
which
i
have
referred
to
and
which
are
in
the
multiple
ownership
rules
themselves
are
relevant
in
considering
an
increase
in
number
of
stations
from
four
to
five,
why
aren't
they
equally
relevant
in
considering
an
increase
from
five
to
six.
what
is
the
magic
of
the
number
five
or
the
number
seven?
i
hope
your
honors
will
direct
that
questions
specifically
to
mr.
baker
because
up
to
this
point
there
hasn't
been
the
slightest
attempt
to
meet
that
problem.
there
isn't
any
attempt
by
the
commission
here
to
relate
the
specific
limitations
which
they
have
adopted,
either
to
the
anti-monopoly
policy
or
to
the
program
diversification
policy.
now,
in
that
connection,
i
don't
want
to
be
unfair
to
the
commission
in
any
respect
and
i
would
like
therefore
to
confine
my
comments
here
for
those
reasons.
that
the
precise
language
used
by
the
commission
in
its
report,
in
ostensible
support
for
these
limitations.
first,
in
the
case
of
am,
the
number
seven
was
selected,
why?
in
order
that
the
present
holdings
of
such
stations
be
not
unduly
disrupted,
clearly,
no
relationship
in
that
to
the
avowed
purposes
of
the
rules.
in
the
case
of
fm,
this
is
at
page
31
of
the
record,
the
number
seven
was
selected,
why?
because
it
is
considered
desirable
to
have
the
same
limitation
applicable
to
both
am
and
fm.
now
what
relationship
does
that
have
to
the
avowed
purposes
of
the
rules?
and
finally
at
page
30
of
the
record
in
the
case
of
t.v.
the
number
five
is
selected
because
it
is
the
existing
limitation
on
t.v.
station
ownership
which
in
our
judgment
based
on
extensive
experience
with
the
problems
of
multiple
ownership
have
proven
practicable
and
desirable
and
that's
it
and
that's
all.
not
only
is
that
unrelated
to
the
avowed
purposes
of
the
rule,
that
statement
with
reference
to
television
is
a
meaningless
abstraction.
the
commission
points
to
and
can
point
to,
no
instance
whatever
of
any
experience
with
ownership
in
more
than
the
specified
number
of
television
stations.
there
isn't
any
basis
shown
in
the
commission's
report
or
in
the
record
for
the
specific
limits
which
the
commission
has
imposed.
the
reason
they're
stated
could
apply
with
equal
force
or
lack
of
force
in
my
view
that
the
number
17
or
77
or
any
other
number
that
might
be
pulled
out
of
a
hat.
in
that
connection
i
should
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
a
statement
which
i
think
significant
by
commissioner
dorfman
in
1954
in
connection
with
the
modification
so
as
to
provide
two
additional
ultrahigh
frequency
stations
as
distinguished
from
vhf
stations.
commissioner
dorfman
said,
“i
have
grave
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
picking
a
number
without
more
reliable
and
persuasive
evidence
that
the
number
chosen
within
all
cases
mark
the
upper
limit
of
what
will
safeguard
the
public
interest.”
there
is
not
much
more
than
intuition
as
the
basis
for
the
present
rule."
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
if
your
honor
concludes
from
that,
nevertheless,
that
any
rule
they
might
adopt
would
be
valid
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
--
and
i
find
that
a
very
shocking
statement.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
i
don't
believe
with
all
deference,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
any
court
is
going
quite
that
far,
i
certainly
concur.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
that
the
judgments
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
is
there
not
a
difference,
the
court
please,
between
a
conclusion
reached
by
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
facts
before
them,
on
the
basis
of
considerations
expressed
by
them,
a
conclusion
with
which
this
court
or
some
other
court
might
differ.
it's
quite
clear
in
that
case
that
the
courts
will
not
interfere
with
the
action
taken
by
the
administrative
agency
because
they
are
supposed
to
have
the
expertise
so
long
as
there
as
a
reasonable
basis
upon
which
they
might
have
acted.
then
the
courts
will
leave
and
properly
leave
the
determinations
of
the
administration
--
administrative
agency
alone.
but
the
congress
has
not
said
that
anything
that
the
administrative
agency
determines
is
automatically
free
from
inquiry
on
the
contrary.
they
have
specifically
written
into
the
law,
provisions
for
judicial
review.
and
i
submit
that
those
provisions
for
judicial
review
are
meaningless
unless
they
enable
the
court
to
insist
that
if
there
are
rules
adopted
like
this,
there
must
be
some
basis
shown
so
that
the
court
itself
can
determine
whether
the
figures
selected
are
within
a
reasonable
range,
not
that
there
is
a
right
figure.
that
isn't
the
point
but
so
that
there
is
some
basis
for
tying
up
in
making
the
relationship
between
the
number
that
they
select
and
the
interest
that
they
are
suppose
to
subserve.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
that
is
what
is
asserted
as
to
justification,
that's
right.
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
on
this
record
where
there
is
no
basis
shown
where
the
selection
of
five,
i
say
that
your
honors
have
to
strike
that
down.
because
the
test
in
the
statute
is
still
the
public
interest
convenience
and
necessity
and
that's
the
one
they're
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
our
precise
point
though,
one
of
our
precise
points
in
this
case
is
that
the
commission
in
its
order
here,
adopting
these
rules
has
not
laid
bear
its
mind
in
such
a
fashion
that
this
court
can
properly
come
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
its
within
the
realm
of
reason
or
not.
now,
the
commission
--
mr.
albert
r.
connelly
a
proposed
rule
was
announced
back
in
1948,
not
the
rule
which
is
actually
adopted
but
in
general
covered
the
same
area.
hearings
were
held
in
1949
and
then
nothing
else
happened.
until
the
end
was
a
hearing,
arguments
were
made.
until
the
end
of
1953,
some
four
years
after
the
--
the
arguments
on
the
question,
the
commission
came
out
with
these
rules
effective
1954.
the
hearing
and
the
record
of
that
hearing
to
the
extent
that
either
party
has
thought
it
important
is
included
in
the
records
and
appeals
so
that
if
there's
anything
at
all
that
took
place
in
that
hearing
which
justifies
the
action
the
commission
took
is
in
this
little
brown
record
here.
and
i
submit
that
your
honors
will
find
absolutely
nothing
beyond
what
i
have
read
to
you
which
purports
to
support
those
limitations.
now
the
commission,
in
its
report,
did
take
cognizance
of
the
widespread
criticism
of
the
proposed
rules
that
they
were
arbitrary.
they
--
they
gave
no
answer
to
that
argument
which
said
simply,
“well
anything
else
would
be
unsatisfactory
or
unworkable.”
but
again,
to
use
the
commission's
own
language
and
this
is
at
page
22
of
the
record,
paragraph
11.
in
view
of
the
arguments
advanced
by
some
party
that
the
proposed
rules
are
arbitrary
and
that
they
give
no
effect
to
class
and
size
of
stations,
geographical
locations,
populations
served,
and
similar
factors,
we
have
considered
alternatives
to
the
present
proposal.
but
as
a
result
of
the
study
of
the
present
holdings
of
multiple
owners,
we
have
concluded
that
any
proposal
to
limit
multiple
ownership
on
the
basis
of
such
factors
as
class
of
station,
geographical
location
is
either
unsatisfactory
or
unworkable.
now,
i
submit
that
that
observation
would
reasonably
justify
a
conclusion
that
no
formula
should
be
adopted
but
it
clearly
does
not
justify
the
conclusion
that
an
arbitrary
formula
can
be
adopted.
these
rules
in
our
view
are
invalid
because
they
repudiate
the
congressional
intent
that
anti-trust
questions
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
with
respect
to
competition
and
because
they
repudiate
the
congressional
intent
that
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity
in
the
ground
of
licences
be
determined
with
reference
to
the
relevant
and
all
the
relevant
facts.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
miller
case
in
294
u.s.
involving
administrative
regulation
equating
the
loss
of
a
hand
with
total
disability,
the
court
said
the
vice
of
the
regulation
therefore,
is
that
it
assumes
to
convert
what
in
the
view
of
the
statute
is
a
question
of
fact
requiring
proof
into
a
conclusive
presumption
which
dispenses
with
proof
and
precludes
dispute.
this
is
beyond
administrative
power.
we
submit
that
the
court
below
correctly
set
aside
the
numerical
prescription
provisions
of
these
rules.
