justice

is
the
government

is
the
government
retaining?
has
an
indictment
filed
yet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
retaining
the
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
find,
mr.
burrell,
your
application
for
habeas
corpus
is
acquitted
if
i
tell
you
what
i'm
curious
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
ask
that
he
be
relieved
on
condition
and
that
--
that
he
be
tried
or
in
the
form
of
reasonable
time
for
trial
that
he'd
be
released.
you
didn't
put
the
government
the
necessity
of
saying
we
can't
try
him
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
there's
no
likely
that
we
could
try
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
is
just
on
the
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
order
was
based
on
a
motion
to
do
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where's
the
district
court's
judgments?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
a
judgment
have
we
got
in
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
there's
this
provision,
until
the
sanity
of
mental
competency
under
--
which
shows
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it's
--
it's
--
firstly,
the
indictment
by
the
united
states
and
not
brought
to
trial,
an
habeas
corpus
proceeding
may
be
pursued
asking
the
government
to
try
the
fellow
or
release
him
because
to
keep
--
detain
a
man
indefinitely
bars
the
constitutional
provision
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
petty
trial
and
(inaudible)
you
now
filed
a
habeas
corpus
for
his
release
on
the
provision
that
the
government
doesn't
need
to
trial.
then
they
would
have
to
say,
"well,
we
can't
try
him
now
because
he
is
unfit
to
be
tried."
they
would
then
have
to
say,
"but
we
hope
one
of
these
days
we
could
try
him."
in
short,
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
has
put
to
you
shortly
after
you
opened,
this
case
doesn't
present
on
this
record
that
create
that
issue
of
a
case
where
the
person
is
taken
under
detention
first
in
the
arrest
of
--
by
the
--
by
the
united
states
marshal
under
a
valid
indictment,
under
an
appropriate
statute
and
it
turns
out
that
he
is
mentally
incapable
of
being
put
to
trial
then
it
turns
out
further
that
--
that
in
encompass,
it
can
be
determined,
it
is
determined
that
he
never
will
be
put
to
trial
and
the
government,
in
order
to
keep
things
off
the
books
that
have
no
business
to
be
there,
now
process
the
indictment
that
this
man
is
a
danger
if
let
loose,
the
state
of
ohio
or
some
other
state
wouldn't
take
him
and
then
the
statute
comes
into
operation.
we
haven't
got
that
case
here,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i'd
ask
you,
that
--
solicitor
general
will
tell
us
that
is
your
version.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
hold
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
the
psychiatric
reports
for
--
reported
high
probability
or
probability
of
recovery
within
the
not
too
remote
kind,
would
you
hold
the
statute
was
then
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
we're
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we're
--
then
we
are
in
a
situation
where
there
is
not
only
no
probability
that
he
will
be
able
to
be
put
on
trial,
but
the
probability
is
that
he
move.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
is
the
--
tend
to
live
with
it.
and
then
they
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
those
are
--
so
that
--
the
indictments
are
still
hanging
over
him.
i
suppose
on
its
face
we
have
constitutionally
whether
it's
constitutional
law,
a
different
argument
if
there
is
still
potential
out
to
put
to
trial
somebody
properly
indicted,
although
it
may
take
years
for
that
power
to
be
exercised
but
in
the
mean
time
he
can't
be
allowed
out
on
bail
or
otherwise
allowed
out
because
he'd
be
a
menace
to
society.
we
haven't
got
that
case
here,
have
we
or
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
would
be
a
very
different
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
isn't
--
the
case
that
i
quote
where
it
would
be
--
where
he'd
be
out
of
the
question,
humanly
out
of
the
question
that
he
ever
would
be
put
to
trial
under
a
valid
indictment
and
the
government
in
the
interest
of
having
--
having
the
records
cleared
of
(inaudible)
now
process
the
indictment
so
as
not
to
have
an
indictment
outstanding
that
never
will
come
into
operation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
is
detained
--
so
that
he
is
detained,
not
as
a
potential
defendant
by
the
government
of
the
united
states,
but
he
is
detained
solely
and
exclusively
because
he
would
be
a
menace
if
left
at
large
and
the
state
doesn't
make
it
over,
we
haven't
got
that
case
here,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
haven't
got
that
case
here,
that's
under
--
that's
another
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
we
haven't
got
--
if
that
still
clear
in
the
case
in
bringing
out
the
difficulties,
i
think
one
would
be
confronted
with
if
we
did
have
it
here,
namely,
if
a
man
is
sentenced
to
five
years,
served
his
five
years,
suppose
the
sentence
that
he
got
and
ordinarily
the
prison
gates
would
be
open,
they
are
not
open
because
he
would
be
a
menace
to
society
to
let
him
out
and
the
state
authority
say
you've
got
a
new
pleading,
we
haven't
got
that
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
--
and
we
haven't
got
the
legal
question
that
would
--
that
that
was
raised,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
have
we
got
a
case
in
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
haven't
got
it.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
then
--
then
that
comes
into
operation,
the
hypothetical
case
i
put
before
you
would
try
in
whatever
this
you
may
say,
habeas
corpus
say,
my
client
would
be
put
to
trial
or
he
should
be
released
and
the
government
would
then
have
to
(inaudible),
they
would
say,
well
we
are
detaining
him
(inaudible)
they
--
they
say
that,
just
that
one
thing.
but
if
they
say
that
he
has
no
defense,
then
there
is
no
forecast,
no
respectable
forecast
that
he
ever
will
have.
for
practical
purposes
we
might
dismiss
the
indictment.
we
can't
release
your
client
because
of
the
mental
status
he's
in.
we
haven't
got
that
case
here
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
had
no
problem
that
the
states
showed
that,
the
state
have
--
the
states
have
power.
they
have
the
question
of
power
and
he
would
be
driven
deranged
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
have
arrest
him
in
public,
then
they
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
federal
government
has
the
power
just
in
regard
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
this
district,
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
is
a
statute,
i
don't
know
its
term,
but
it
was
a
statute
in
this
district
whereby
was
on
an
acquittal,
don't
you
think?
on
acquittal
you
may
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
your
problem,
that's
your
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
answer
it?
are
you
going
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
say,
it
hasn't
gotten
to
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
this
is
the
case,
it
doesn't
prevent
the
question
that
would
be
presented
here
if
some
insane
person
at
large
in
kansas
city
is
a
menace
to
the
people,
i'm
not
talking
about
somebody
under
indictment,
just
somebody
who
is
unfortunately
mentally
unbalanced
and
has
proved
to
himself
to
be
a
menace
in
his
fellow
citizens
and
missouri
does
nothing
about
it
and
kansas
city,
the
city
of
kansas,
does
--
does
nothing
about
it.
the
united
states
marshall
can't
do
anything
about
it,
the
u.s.
attorney
couldn't
do
about
it,
the
attorney
general
couldn't
anything
about
it,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
uncle
sam
can
jump
in
because
of
some
local
authorities
on
the
state
doesn't
attend
to
that
kind
of
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
danger
to
society,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
the
reason
the
precise
fact
in
this
case
becomes
very
important,
but
we
haven't
got
the
case
that
i
put
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
should
be,
i
think
as
being
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
we
can
overrule
to
the
contrary
finding
by
the
district
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
give
--
what
kind
of
power
is
it
for
uncle
sam
to
detain
somebody
who
is
harmlessly
and
cheerfully
insane?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
there
is
--
is
the
door
opened?
is
there
a
basis
for
taking
that
as
right
for
--
deliver
him
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
case
you
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
does
indefinite
mean,
if
you
don't
know
when
it
will
come
to
an
end
or
that
there's
practically
no
likelihood
that
it
never
will
come
to
an
end
which
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
be
--
that
may
be
--
why
insensible
consideration
of
accommodation,
i
do
not
think
it's
a
source
of
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
would
have
--
if
you
have
the
power,
then
the
power
could
be
asserted
whether
the
state
would
or
wouldn't.
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
state
should
but
doesn't,
it
doesn't
get
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
gives
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
question
is
the
source
of
the
power
and
not
that
you
referred
to
the
state
if
the
state
is
willing
to
assume
it.
it's
too
easy
to
jump
when
the
state
shall
witness
the
defendant
(inaudible)
that's
too
easy,
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
it
--
i
--
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
wasn't
all
and
say
--
says,
on
my
responsibility
at
this
time
and
as
the
administrator
of
the
--administered
a
great
experience
in
this
domain,
i
think
that
there
isn't
ghost
of
a
chance
of
this
man
ever
coming
into
a
state
of
mind
when
he
commit
his
crime,
but
i
am
not
god,
so
i
don't
know.
next
week
somebody
might
discover
a
drug
which
make
this
strange
creature
really
a
fine
upstanding
citizen
and
a
poet
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
want
to
know
what
this
case
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
is
this
the
case
in
which
the
government
comes
and
says,
we
have
not
surrendered
our
right
to
try
him
under
an
indictment
validly
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
government's
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that.
i
cannot
understand,
leading
me
out
in
the
(inaudible)
and
say,
well,
he
may
never
be
tried,
but
we
have
the
power
to
go
(inaudible)
to
the
next
step.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
make
this
tremendous
--
the
government
can
process
the
indictment,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
even
ready
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
if
he
shot
a
judge,
a
federal
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
the
case
of
a
judge
of
this
court
has
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
he
was
a
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
even
a
mere
(inaudible)
would
be
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
is
--
it's
is
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
--
if
that's
this
case,
as
i
believe
it
to
be,
then
that's
the
case
to
be
decided,
not
a
case
where
the
government
discharging
its
special
relation
to
him
by
dismissing
the
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
has
--
one
has
to
consider
the
reach
of
the
statute.
if
this
statute
is
here,
the
state
government
--
by
the
government
of
somebody
who
is
now
still
under
responsibility
to
it,
you've
got
one
of
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
ohio
won't
do
it
that
he's
dangerous,
all
that
presupposes
that
the
states
are
indifferent
to
danger
by
--
against
its
citizens
by
another
citizen
and
that
is
not
the
hypothesis
on
which
the
legislation
to
be
sustained.
