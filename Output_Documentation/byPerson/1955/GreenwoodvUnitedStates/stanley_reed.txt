justice

but
you
have
4248.
justice
stanley
reed
which
--
which
is
--
is
that
the
governing
section
over
4246
as
to
what
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
understand
what
would
be
a
commitment
under
4248.
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
understand
what
would
be
a
commitment
under
4248.
justice
stanley
reed
or
47.
justice
stanley
reed
but
that's
what
we
have
here,
isn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
and
what
does
it
say?
his
commitment
shall
run
until
the
sanity
shall
be
restored.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
does
that
mean
that
it
--
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
that
means
that
he
must
stay
there
forever
if
he
never
recovers.
justice
stanley
reed
the
problem
we
have
here
is
whether
the
federal
government
can
enact
such
a
statute.
justice
stanley
reed
construed
it
so
in
an
instance
where
actually
the
man
was
permanently
insane
or
had
there
been
any
findings
yet?
did
they
ever
make
a
finding
that
a
person
is
permanently
insane?
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you
never
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
had
a
habeas
corpus,
did
you?
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you've
got
a
finding
of
what,
the
indefinite
confinement?
justice
stanley
reed
they
would
probably
require
indefinite
hospitalization.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
that
there
is
a
finding
as
i
read
it
that
they
said
his
prognosis
were
recovered,
that
was
before
and
he
will
require
indefinite
hospitalization.
justice
stanley
reed
what
you
have
is
an
indefinite
hospitalization.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
are
there
more
degrees
of
insanity
than
temporary
and
permanent,
more
degrees
of
the
instance
of
insanity?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i'm
--
i'm
thinking
the
question
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
raised.
it'd
be
one
thing
if
we
knew
and
had
a
holding
and
a
ruling
that
this
man
was
permanently
and
uncurably
insane.
now,
is
that
what
--
you're
not
presenting
that
case,
you're
presenting
a
case
that
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
you
said
of
indefinite
character
and
may
probably
will
last
for
several
years.
justice
stanley
reed
perhaps
many
years.
justice
stanley
reed
and
perhaps
for
life.
now,
it's
under
those
circumstances
that
you
say
that
the
federal
government
has
no
power
to
protect
the
public
and
to
keep
the
man
ready
for
trial.
justice
stanley
reed
the
government
has
power
to
try
people
for
their
certain
crimes.
if
you
have
power
to
try
people
for
certain
crimes,
you
have
the
incidental
powers
that
go
with
the
proper
conduct
of
those
criminal
courts,
do
you
not?
justice
stanley
reed
mr.
burrell,
on
page
18
of
the
record,
accused
here
in
his
presently
insane
and
so
mentally
incompetent,
that's
the
finding
of
a
judge,
now,
what
--
what
is
--
is
--
what
you
read
on
68,
the
evidence
that
he
had
before
him
and
all
the
evidence.
justice
stanley
reed
he
had
--
he
had
appointed
some
psychiatrists
in
his
own
court
that
he
had.
justice
stanley
reed
and
did
they
make
a
report?
justice
stanley
reed
and
they
testified
sufficiently
to
support
the
finding
of
a
judge
in
your
point
of
view?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that's
--
that's
not
what
was
on
page
68.
justice
stanley
reed
where
--
where
does
that
--
that
testimony?
is
that
pointed
out
in
the
record?
justice
stanley
reed
those
are
the
ones
appointed
to
the
court?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
you
have
--
you
have
something
else
to
add
don't
you,
mr
solicitor
general
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
who
will
probably
require
indefinite
hospitalization.
justice
stanley
reed
so
--
so
far
as
any
one
can
see
now
the
finding
is
that
he
will
be
held
for
the
indefinite
future.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
as
i
--
as
i
understand
under
the
statutes,
you
keep
--
justice
stanley
reed
the
united
states
keeps
him.
justice
stanley
reed
for
an
indefinite
period.
justice
stanley
reed
in
fact,
you
have
a
statute
to
that
effect,
don't
you?
