mr.
william
j.
burrell
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
solicitor
general.
i
represent
in
this
case
mr.
earl
p.
greenwood,
who
is
the
petitioner
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
to
review
a
decision.
the
eighth
circuit
reviewed
and
affirmed
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
which
was
entered
on
july
30th,
1954,
committing
your
petitioner
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
upon
certain
terms
and
conditions
which
will
be
referred
to
in
detail
later.
i
was
appointed
by
the
court,
district
court
in
kansas
city
by
judge
ridge.
the
greenwood
had
no
funds.
he
has
now
been
in
the
federal
custody
for
over
three
years
and
he
is
insane
and
incompetent
and
still
is
unable
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges
pending
against
him.
briefly,
the
questions
before
this
court,
the
first
question
is
whether
or
not
the
provisions
of
sections
4244
and
4246,
4247
and
4248
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
which
are
set
out
in
detail
in
the
appendix
to
both
of
the
briefs
whether
or
not
these
provisions
provide
for
the
continued
confinement
of
an
accused
charged
with
a
federal
crime
who
has
found
to
be,
we'll
say,
permanently
insane
so
that
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
be
able
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges
against
him.
in
other
words,
if
those
are
the
circumstances,
do
these
sections,
properly
interpreted,
provide
for
the
continued
commitment
of
such
an
accused
by
the
federal
government?
the
second
question
is
if
these
do
--
these
sections
under
these
circumstances
do
provide
for
the
continued
commitment
of
such
a
person,
are
they
unconstitutional
as
violating
the
tenth
amendment
reserving
to
the
state's
powers
not
delegated
to
the
federal
government
or
is
petitioner
perhaps
being
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law?
mr.
william
j.
burrell
yes,
sir?
mr.
william
j.
burrell
as
far
as
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
may
--
i
think
i
have
overstated
myself,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
and
that
the
record
will
support
this
conclusion
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner's
condition
is
such
that
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
ever
be
tried
at
least
in
the
foreseeable
future.
i
think
the
question
of
actual
permanency
is
a
difficult
thing
but
as
far
as
the
psychiatrist
can
tell
at
this
time,
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
be
able
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges
that
are
pending
against
him.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
there
has
been
an
indictment
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
the
indictment
has
--
has
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
is
remaining
pending.
and
then
the
final
question
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
finding
which
was
made
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner
will
probably
endanger
the
safety
of
the
officers,
the
property
or
other
interest
of
the
united
states
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence
and
whether
or
not
such
a
condition
or
finding
is
the
proper
basis
for
the
continued
confinement
of
the
petitioner.
now,
the
facts
are
that
in
november
of
1952,
greenwood
was
arrested
under
an
indictment
charging
him
with
the
armed
robbery
of
a
federal
post
office
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
he
was
arrested
in
november
of
1952.
the
alleged
crime
was
committed
on
october
the
22nd
of
1952,
less
than
a
month
or
approximately
a
month
before
his
arrest.
greenwood
was
then
transferred
to
the
southern
--
the
eastern
division
of
the
southern
district
--
i
believe
maybe
the
northern
district
of
ohio
under
rule
20
and
when
he
came
up
before
this
ohio
district
court,
a
question
arose
as
to
his
mental
condition.
and
in
december
of
1952,
he
was
examined
by
a
psychiatrist
in
cleveland,
ohio
and
this
was
only
two
months
after
the
crime
was
allegedly
committed
and
then
that
psychiatrist
examined
him
the
following
month
in
january
of
1953
and
found
him
to
be
incompetent,
unable
to
understand
proceedings
against
him,
at
least
unable
to
properly
assist
his
counsel.
so
the
united
states
district
judge
there
in
cleveland,
ohio
then
referred
the
--
the
case
back
to
the
court
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
at
that
time,
then
approximately
in
february
of
1953,
the
matter
came
up
before
judge
reeves
and
he
was
then
informed
of
the
background
of
petitioner's
mental
disturbances
at
least
what
had
happened
and
what
had
been
found
by
the
court
in
ohio.
and
petitioner
was
then
committed
to
the
--
at
least
sent
to
the
united
states
medical
center
for
federal
prisoners
at
springfield,
missouri.
that's
where
he
is
now
and
that's
where
he
has
been
really
for
almost
three
years.
he
was
committed
there
by
the
court
for
observation
as
to
his
mental
condition.
his
condition
is
of
course
important
to
the
understanding
of
this
case
and
therefore
i
just
like
to
refer
briefly
to
the
various
reports
which
were
made
by
the
neuropsychiatric
staff
there
of
the
medical
center
for
federal
prisoners
at
springfield.
the
first
report
was
made,
it's
in
page
64
of
the
record.
as
to
the
final
conclusions,
the
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
petitioner
was
suffering
from
schizophrenia
as
an
acute
and
undifferentiated
type.
he
was
unable
properly
to
choose
between
right
and
wrong.
he
was
motivated
by
insane
delusions
and
that
he
was
unable
to
properly
understand
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
to
cooperate
with
counsel
in
his
defense,
a
long
history
there
is
given
in
connection
with
that
report.
and
then
it
appears
exactly
why
the
greenwood
was
at
the
medical
center
for
such
a
continued
length
of
time
is
not
clear.
but
at
any
rate,
our
next
report
is
in
january
of
1954,
a
report
of
the
neuropsychiatric
staff
on
page
65
of
the
record
in
which
they
agreed
that
the
patient
remain
psychotic
and
incompetent.
they
agree
that
the
patient's
illness
was
chronic,
of
longstanding
and
the
--
the
prognosis
for
recovery
was
poor.
the
staff
recommended
that
the
committing
court
be
advised
that
our
finding
indicates
that
it
is
unlikely
that
this
subject
will
regain
his
sanity
in
the
near
future.
the
staff
recommended
consideration
to
transferring
the
subject
to
the
--
a
state
hospital
in
the
state
of
his
residence.
his
residence
has
been
cleveland,
ohio.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
here
that
that
is
the
state
of
greenwood's
residence.
he
was
born
there.
he
still
has
a
family
there.
after
this
report
was
made,
there
was
another
matter
came
up
before
the
court
thereon
february
1st,
1954
--
february
2nd
and
then
order
was
made
by
judge
ridge
there
at
that
time
found
on
page
12
of
the
record
in
which
it
referred
to
the
report
of
the
staff
that
i
have
just
read
in
which
the
court
made
the
statement
substantially
that
it
was
now
determined
that
the
defendant
is
so
mentally
defective
that
he
will
probably
never
be
able
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges
pending
against
him.
the
court
suggested
further
opinion
be
secured
from
the
staff
at
springfield
as
to
whether
or
not
the
conditions
which
will
be
discussed
later
set
forth
in
section
4247
of
title
18
of
the
code
existed.
those
conditions
of
whether
or
not
the
accused
is
--
might
--
will
probably
endanger
the
safety
of
the
property,
officers
or
other
interests
of
the
united
states.
and
the
court
suggested
a
further
proceeding
at
that
time
might
be
had
with
reference
to
a
finding
as
to
those
conditions,
but
in
the
meantime
and
pursuant
to
the
suggestion
of
the
court
which
was
in
the
final
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
the
court
suggested
that
perhaps
greenwood
could
be
transferred
to
a
hospital
or
to
the
proper
authorities
in
the
state
of
his
residence
having
in
mind
that
his
mental
condition
was
such
that
he
would
likely
not
be
tried.
and
so
pursuant
to
that
suggestion,
the
federal
authorities
did
release
greenwood
to
the
authorities
in
the
state
of
ohio.
that
occurred
approximately
in
may
of
1954.
unfortunately,
the
record
is
not
as
clear
as
we
would
like
to
have
it
as
to
just
what
transpired
in
ohio.
however,
it
is
--
it
is
clear
that
he
came
up
before
the
probate
court
there,
that
he
was
in
the
receiving
hospital
there
at
cleveland,
ohio,
that
one
psychiatrist
examined
him
and
apparently
thought
that
he
was
sane.
at
any
rate
it
is
clear
that
the
ohio
authorities,
and
that
thereafter
he
had
come
before
the
probate
court,
concluded
that
it
was
safe
at
least
to
release
him.
and
so
he
was
released
and
as
soon
as
he
was
released,
he
was
arrested
by
the
federal
authorities,
returned
to
kansas
city,
missouri
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
i
was
appointed
to
represent
him.
the
court
suggested
that
a
hearing
should
be
held
under
section
4244
to
determine
greenwood's
competency
to
stand
trial.
two
psychiatrists
were
appointed
by
the
court,
greenwood
was
referred
back
to
springfield,
missouri
for
further
examination
by
the
psychiatrist
and
on
july
30th
--
or
rather
july
15,
1954,
there
was
a
hearing
with
reference
to
the
mental
competency
of
the
petitioner
to
stand
trial.
the
two
psychiatrists
appointed
by
the
court,
who
had
only
examined
greenwood
approximately
an
hour,
concluded
that
he
was
sane
in
their
opinion.
but
dr.
smith,
who
was
the
chief
of
the
neuropsychiatric
staff
at
springfield,
whose
staff
had
just
examined
him,
who
had
observed
him
some
15
or
16
months
while
he
was
at
springfield,
testified
that
the
petitioner
was
still
insane,
he
was
incompetent
and
the
opinions
of
the
staff
from
time
to
time
that
i
had
been
referred
to
were
--
were
admitted
in
evidence
and
it
was
the
unanimous
opinion
of
that
staff
that
at
that
time,
which
was
in
july
of
1954,
that
petitioner
was
insane
and
couldn't
stand
trial.
and
so
the
court
made
the
order
of
july
30th,
1954,
which
is
the
order
that
is
appealed
from
and
it
is
the
order
which
is
set
forth
on
page
17
to
18
of
the
record.
the
court
found
that
petitioner
was
insane
and
mentally
incompetent
to
stand
trial.
the
court
further
found
that
if
released
he
would
--
will
probably
or
would
probably
endanger
the
safety
of
the
officers,
property
or
other
interests
of
the
united
states.
the
court
found
that
suitable
arrangements
were
not
available
for
the
care
and
custody
of
greenwood
other
than
by
commitment
to
the
attorney
general.
these
findings
are
findings
which
are
set
out
in
section
4247
of
the
statute
in
question.
based
upon
those
findings,
greenwood
was
committed
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
either
until
his
mental
competency
is
restored
or
until
it
is
improved
to
such
an
extent
that
he
will
not
endanger
the
safety
of
the
officers,
the
property
or
other
interests
of
the
united
states
or
until
suitable
arrangements
are
made
--
are
available
in
the
state
of
his
residence
for
his
care
and
custody
at
least
that
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
don't
know
that
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
they
referred
to
the
officers,
property
or
other
interests.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
oh,
there
was
--
in
fact
to
the
contrary,
there
was
not.
i
will
come
to
that
in
--
in
the
facts,
there
was
not
that
--
the
use
of
the
word
officers
well
i
think
was
to
comply
with
the
--
with
the
statute
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
that's
the
statutory
language.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
was
used
there.
and
so
at
this
--
it
is
this
order
that
i
have
just
referred
to
in
which
the
findings
were
made
pursuant
to
section
4247
and
in
which
the
commitment
was
made
pursuant
to
section
4248,
it
is
this
order
that
is
appealed
from
and
that
this
court
is
now
reviewing.
it
might
be
advisable
briefly
to
refer
to
the
sections
of
the
statute
in
question.
the
first
one
is
section
4244,
found
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
which
provides
for
the
--
a
hearing
by
the
court
in
the
event
that
there
is
some
suggestion
made
that
an
accused
is
insane
and
can't
stand
trial.
there
was
a
hearing
in
our
case
under
section
4244.
section
4246,
found
on
page
35
of
our
brief,
provides
for
a
commitment
in
the
event
of
a
determination
of
insanity
or
a
commitment
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
until
the
mental
competency
of
the
petitioner
is
restored
or
the
accused
so
that
he
can
stand
trial
or
until
the
charges
against
him
are
disposed
off
according
to
law.
and
then
there
is
a
further
part
of
section
4246
in
which
it
is
stated
that
if
the
condition
specified
in
4247
exist
which
i
assume
means
--
are
those
provisions
referring
to
potential
dangerousness
and
the
lack
of
arrangements
elsewhere
for
the
accused.
if
those
conditions
exist
then
the
statute
says
the
commitment
shall
be
governed
by
section
4248.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
he
should,
under
these
circumstances,
be
released
to
the
proper
authorities
in
ohio.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
at
that
time
they
let
him
out
and
if
--
it
--
i
think
it
is
something
within
ohio's
jurisdiction
and
if
--
it
depends
upon
what
they
want
to
do
with
him
at
that
time.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
that
could
conceivably
happen,
your
honor.
it's
just
a
question
there
that
--
of
course
i
would
think
there
would
have
to
be
some
limit
to
re-arresting
him
and
--
and
sending
him
back
and
forth.
but
it
is
our
position
that
this
man
is
a
sick
person
and
insane
and
therefore
it
is
his
own
state
that
has
a
jurisdiction
to
care
for
him
and
whether
they
want
to
put
him
in
an
institution
or
whether
they
want
to
release
him
to
--
to
his
parents
for
trial
period
is
up
to
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
my
--
that
would
be
my
opinion,
yes.
of
course,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
that
ohio
could
--
he
could
be
released
by
ohio
and
still
not
be
able
to
stand
trial.
he
can
be
incompetent
and
still
it
is
necessarily
true
that
he
has
to
be
confined
as
he
is
now.
now,
the
second
--
and
that
i
think
we
have
completed
reviewing
statutes
and
so
we
come
to
our
first
point
that
the
statutes
do
not
authorize
the
continued
commitment
of
an
accused
who
is
so
insane
that
it
will
--
it
is
likely
that
he
will
never
will
be
able
to
stand
trial
on
the
charges
against
him.
in
this
connection,
we
would
like
to
refer
to
the
case
of
wells
versus
attorney
general
which
is
a
court
of
appeals
case
for
the
tenth
circuit.
now,
there
are
quotations
from
this
case
on
page
12
to
14
of
the
brief.
now,
in
this
case,
an
accused
who
was
insane
was
committed
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
4246
until
he
was
--
the
charges
against
him
were
disposed
off
according
to
law
or
until
the
--
his
condition
improved
so
that
he
could
be
tried.
and
he
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
which
he
contended
that
he
was
permanently
insane
or
was
likely
that
he
would
never
be
tried
that
he
was
therefore
being
held
possibly
for
life
for
the
sole
reason
that
his
mental
condition
was
such
that
he
--
he
couldn't
stand
trial
and
therefore
that
the
right
of
the
--
of
the
federal
government
to
continue
to
imprison
him
ceased
when
it
appeared
unlikely
that
they
could
ever
try
him.
and
that
matter
came
up
before
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
should
be
granted,
that
the
care
of
the
insane,
that
the
custody
of
those
that
are
mentally
ill
is
a
power
which
has
not
been
delegated
to
the
united
states.
it
is
a
power
which
has
been
reserved
to
the
states
and
that
when
it
appeared
that
a
person
would
not
likely
be
tried
then
it
was
up
to
the
united
states
to
release
him
because
the
reason
for
detaining
him
no
longer
existed.
and
the
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
statute
should
not
be
construed
to
provide
for
the
continued
detention
of
such
a
person
who
was
suffering
from
such
a
mental
illness
and
the
statute
was
therefore
so
construed,
the
--
the
court
referred
to
the
capacity
of
the
states
in
their
character
as
parens
patriae
in
caring
for
those
that
were
ill.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
this
particular
commitment
was
not
under
the
second
sentence.
it
was
under
the
first
sentence.
i
will
point
out
to
the
court
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
it
is
--
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
either
under
the
first
or
the
second
sentence
of
4246,
the
same
principles
do
apply.
that
if
the
man
is
so
insane
that
he
will
likely
never
be
tried,
that
he
should
be
released
to
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
there
is
this
that
i
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
we
have
4248.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
you
have
to
go
right
through
from
4246
to
4247
to
4248,
they're
all
locked
together.
i
will
say
this
that
this
is,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
only
case
wherein
there
has
been
a
specific
finding
that
the
conditions
in
4247
exist
and
wherein
there
has
been
a
commitment
under
4248.
and
it
is
the
government's
contention
and
i
think
it's
something
that
we
--
i
don't
--
i
want
to
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
it
is
a
commitment
after
a
finding
of
mental
incompetency
under
4246.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
and
after
a
finding
under
4247
that
the
accused
will
likely
--
will
probably
endanger
the
safety
of
the
officers.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
what
we
have
here.
but
the
length
of
the
term
has
been
governed
by
4248.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
correct,
your
honor,
or
until
the
mental
condition
of
the
person
has
so
improved.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
as
far
as
the
--
as
the
specific
wording
of
the
statute,
that
is
correct.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
--
i
think
that
is
correct,
but
i
was
merely
pointing
out
that
in
the
interpretation
of,
we'll
say,
the
first
section
of
section
4246,
wherein
again
there
is
no
reference
to
the
question
of
the
permanency
of
the
--
of
the
illness
of
the
accused,
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
have
interpreted
that
to
only
permit
the
confinement
of
a
person
who's
temporarily
insane.
and
in
order
--
they
have
so
construed
it
so
that
it
would
be
constitutional.
and
it
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
they
--
they
remanded
in
both
cases
in
the
wells
case
and
in
the
higgins
case,
the
wells
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
higgins
case
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
was
--
it
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
was
permanently
insane
or
would
likely
be
able
to
strand
trial
with
the
direction
that
if
he
wouldn't
likely
be
able
to
stand
trial
then
in
--
in
the
near
--
in
a
reasonable
time,
he
should
be
released.
that
was
the
finding.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
he
was
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
he
was
--
the
government
was
going
to
try
him
and
at
that
time
i
moved
to
have
him
examined
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
and
then
the
court
found
him
insane
and
made
this
order.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
we
haven't
filed
a
habeas
corpus.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
this
is
a
direct
appeal
--
originally
they
are
direct
appeal
from
the
order
of
july
30th.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
order
was
based
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
on
a
hearing
pursuant
to
section
4244.
there
had
been
a
suggestion
that
the
accused
wasn't
able
to
stand
trial
and
therefore
pursuant
to
section
4244,
the
court
appointed
a
psychiatrist
and
there
was
a
hearing.
and
after
the
hearing,
the
court
made
these
findings
and
an
order.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
it
--
it's
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
we
have
a
--
the
--
the
district
court's
judgment
is
set
out
on
page
17,
is
the
order
and
memorandum
committing
the
defendant
to
the
u.s.
medical
center,
there
entered
on
july
30th,
1954.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
correct
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
your
honor.
that
is
right.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
petty
trial.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
oh,
i
--
i
think
we
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
we
have,
your
honor,
in
this
respect
that
in
--
his
commitment
here
is
directly
under
the
various
sections
of
the
statute
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
and
it
is
our
position
that
if
he
is
properly
committed
under
these
sections
that
these
sections
are
unconstitutional
and
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
of
course
the
facts
on
their
their
face
now,
he
has
been
down
there
three
--
three
years
now.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
it's
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
it's
--
it's
the
government's
contention
here
as
i
understand
it
that
the
basis
for
--
i
think
they
more
or
less
agree
that
the
basis
for
confining
the
petitioner
here
is
his
is
so-called
potential
dangerousness.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
under
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
we
have
because
the
terms
--
the
terms
of
his
commitment
as
set
forth
in
4248
are
not
in
any
way
related
to
the
pendency
of
the
charges
against
him.
there
is
nothing
there
under
the
terms
of
his
commitment
which
will
allow
him
to
be
released
if
the
charges
against
him
are
dismissed.
in
fact,
he's
being
treated.
this
4247
mainly
applies
to
a
prisoner
who
has
served
his
sentence
completely
and
the
government
doesn't
want
to
release
him
and
therefore
they
make
a
finding
that
he
is
potentially
dangerous
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
he
hasn't
served
his
sentence,
no.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no,
we
haven't
got
that,
but
we
do
have
a
case
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
but
we
do
have
the
case,
your
honor,
where
if
the
charges
against
him
are
dismissed,
he
still
is
confined.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
yes,
sir.
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
because
there
is
nothing
in
--
in
his
order
of
commitment
which
allows
him
to
be
released
if
the
charges
against
him
were
dismissed.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
not
exactly.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
there
is
no
specific
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
there
is
no
specific
finding
in
this
order
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
is
correct
except
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
those
two
psychiatrists
who
thought
he
was
sane
there
in
kansas
city
has
only
examined
him
an
hour
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
and
very
obviously,
the
court
that
heard
the
testimony
didn't
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
didn't
believe
that
--
didn't
believe
it
was
of
much
weight.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
not
to
that
extreme
extent
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
cited
in
the
brief
the
--
as
to
our
second
point,
it
is
that
if
we
construe
these
statutes
as
authorizing
the
continued
commitment
of
your
petitioner
that
they
are
unconstitutional
as
being
in
violation
of
the
tenth
amendment
and
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
judge
duncan
in
the
district
court
there
in
kansas
city,
missouri
in
craig
versus
steele
and
dixon
versus
steele,
cited
on
pages
19
and
21
of
the
brief,
was
substantially
of
the
opinion
that
the
statutes
did
provide
for
such
a
continued
confinement
was
an
invasion
of
the
rights
of
the
state
to
care
for
the
insane
and
therefore
in
this
respect
as
applied
to
a
man
who
wasn't
just
temporarily
insane,
that
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
--
i'm
not
enough
of
an
expert
to
say,
your
honor.
i
do
believe
it
is
true
that
it
is
difficult
for
a
psychiatrist
to
predict
very
definitely
totally
--
total
permanent
insanity.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
and
perhaps
for
life.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
if
it
please
the
court,
the
second
--
the
contention
of
the
united
states
here
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
finding
that
this
man
will
probably
endanger
the
safety
of
the
officers
and
property
or
other
interests
of
the
united
states.
and
the
finding,
the
suitable
arrangements
are
not
available
elsewhere
for
him
supports
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
imprison
him
or
whatever
is
said
about
his
care
or
treatment,
he
is
being
imprisoned
and
he
is
imprisoned
side
by
side
with
prisoners
and
as
just
as
much
of
a
prisoner
as
if
he
was
convicted
and
had
been
convicted
of
--
of
a
crime.
and
i
think
that
it
is
important
that
we
consider
him
as
an
innocent
man
as
we
must
consider
it.
now,
what
about
this
first
condition
that
he
will
probably
endanger
the
safety
of
the
officers,
property
or
other
interests
of
the
united
states.
that's
the
only
finding
that
was
made
here,
what
are
those
other
interests,
what
gives
the
united
states
the
power
to
come
and
take
a
citizen
and
confine
him
perhaps
permanently
on
--
on
a
finding
that
he
probably
will
endanger
some
other
interests
of
the
united
states.
think
--
think
of
the
dangerousness
of
such
a
statute
in
spite
of
the
good
motives
of
the
united
states
or
the
authorities,
i
think,
we
have
here
a
statute
that
by
its
terminology
is
an
extremely
dangerous
statute.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
don't
know
if
that's
just
the
terminology.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i'll
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i'll
be
frank.
i
haven't
made
a
study
of
state
statutes
except
that
i
don't
believe
that
this
particular
provision
is
as
definite
as
the
type
of
thing
that
which
you
have
been
referring.
to
me,
it's
--
it's
quite
vague
to
say
that
someone
will
probably
endanger,
you
don't
have
to
find
that
he
will
endanger
the
officers
of
the
united
states
or
you
don't
have
to
find
that
he
will
endanger
the
--
the
property,
but
even
on
a
finding
of
some
other
interests
without
those
other
interest
being
defined,
we
can
--
we
can
keep
a
man
in
prison
and
that's
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
and
their
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
right.
that
is
the
second
reason
other
than
the
terminology
there,
but
--
but
what
gives
the
united
states
the
power
to
really
enter
this
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
field
of
insanity.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
and
then
--
then
the
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
--
i
thought
--
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
i
--
i
had
answered
it.
it
is,
of
course
our
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
it
is
our
position
that
they
only
have
the
powers
that
are
delegated
to
the
united
states.
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
whatsoever
from
which
that
says
anything
about
incompetence.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
it
--
it
would
have
to
be
a
necessary
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
if
--
if
there
is
some
reasonable
basis
for
keeping
him
in
connection
with
the
--
the
crime
that's
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
once
a
man
commits
a
crime
or
he's
accused
of
committing
a
crime
that
that
gives
the
government
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
him
just
as
if
he
were
living
in
the
district
of
columbia
just
because
he's
accused
of
a
crime,
we
accept
that
proposition
and
i
--
i
have
no
position
to
maintain,
but
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
--
that
is
correct
if
it
appears
that
there
is
some
reasonable
chance
to
try
him.
i
think
the
government
has
admitted
here
that
once
it
appears,
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
be
tried
that
the
government's
power
to
then
continue
to
keep
him
in
the
prison
must
be
based
on
something
other
than
just
the
power.
it's
power
over
crimes
against
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
not
as
i
understand
the
law.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it
is
unless
--
unless
you
would
say
that
because
ohio
has
released
him
but
that's
--
that
--
that
casts
on
society
some
dangerous
person
that
no
one
can
touch.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
right.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
and
--
and
that
gets
to
the
next
--
the
next
question
there
that
the
finding
that
the
suitable
arrangements
aren't
available
elsewhere
is
no
basis
for
the
exercise
of
a
federal
power.
we
can't
base
a
--
a
power
in
the
united
states
upon
a
--
a
finding
that
some
state
according
to
the
federal
government
isn't
properly
exercising
its
--
its
power
here.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
no,
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
but
--
but
we
--
we
do
contend
that
this
--
this
so-called
finding
of
a
federal
court
that
are
suitable
arrangements
are
not
available
elsewhere.
that
kind
of
a
finding
isn't
a
proper
basis
and
doesn't
give
to
the
united
states
the
power
to
assume
jurisdiction
and
put
this
man
in
prison.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
the
--
for
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
--
i
think
that
he
must
be
released
to
the
states
that
has
jurisdiction
over
him,
the
state
of
his
residence
and
i
--
if
in
--
in
your
situation
there,
if
the
state
after
receiving
him,
i
don't
think
we
can
--
if
--
if
they
decide
that
its
safe
to
let
him
go,
i
think
that
--
that
we
have
to
abide
by
that
decision
because
the
jurisdiction
over
this
sick
man
is
in
the
state.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
think
perhaps
it
was
--
it
was
proper
to
bring
him
back
to
find
out
if
he
was
sane
enough
to
stand
a
trial.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
but
once
finding
out
again
that
he
--
he
isn't
able
to
stand
trial,
then
i
think
he
should
under
these
circumstances
be
released.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that's
correct.
and
after
--
i
--
i
don't
think
it
was
necessarily
wrong
for
the
united
states
when
ohio
released
him
to
see
if
he
could
still
stand
trial.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
but
once
they
found
that
he
couldn't,
then
i
think
he
should
be
--
he
should
be
released
under
the
circumstances
back
to
ohio.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
then,
the
--
what
i
--
i
say
here
again
may
be
repetitious,
but
we
have
this
situation
here
on
the
facts
that
a
man
has
been
here
in
prison
for
three
years.
he
has
been
found
unable
to
stand
trial.
he
was
released
back
to
the
state,
his
home,
the
authorities
that
have
jurisdiction
over
him.
and
i
think
that
even
as
the
statute
is
worded,
the
united
states
being
dissatisfied
with
action
taken
by
ohio
has
picked
him
up
again
and
has
him
back
in
prison.
we're
dealing
with
personal
liberty,
not
just
the
question
of
the
division
of
power
between
the
united
states
and
the
states,
but
a
serious
question
of
personal
liberty.
and
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case
that
it
is
up
to
the
states
to
determine
the
care
and
custody
that
should
be
given
to
this
man
and
not
up
to
the
united
states.
now,
i
covert
briefly
in
conclusion
because
of
these
two
conditions
that
the
government
contends
give
to
the
united
states
the
power
to
restrain
this
man.
i
would
like
to
refer
briefly
to
my
final
point
that
there
was
not
substantial
evidence
to
show
that
he
was
potentially
dangerous
to
the
government.
the
reason
for
referring
to
the
evidence
is
that
if
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
allows,
that
comes
within
this
statute,
that
it
allows
the
united
states
to
continue
to
imprison
this
man,
then
it
is
our
position
clearly
that
--
that
this
is
not
a
proper
and
constitutional
statute.
and
referring
to
the
record
on
page
68
and
the
report
of
the
neuropsychiatric
staff
when
the
question
of
the
conditions
under
4247
came
up
as
to
whether
they
existed,
the
board
said
that
they
agreed
that
the
subject
might
be
considered
potentially
dangerous
to
the
extent
that
if
released
he
might
conceivably,
might
conceivably
persist
in
criminal
activities
of
the
type
of
which
he
is
presently
charged.
in
considering
this
man's
mental
illness,
the
board
find
that
he
does
not
hold
any
fixed
delusion
concerning
wanting
to
harm
any
person
or
group
of
persons
either
officials
of
the
government
or
otherwise,
so
that
in
this
respect,
he
probably
would
not
constitute
a
danger
to
the
safety
of
the
officers,
property
or
other
interests
of
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
think
under
the
cases
that
if
it
is
--
you're
not
precluded
from
doing
so.
i
--
we
recognized
the
rule
that
it
was
--
it
is
rarely
done.
the
reason
i'm
particularly
referring
to
this
is
that
if
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
government
is
talking
about
here
that
satisfies
this
statute,
to
me
when
he
get
down
to
the
facts,
we
can
see
how
the
statute
operates
then
it
--
it
shows,
at
least
to
me,
the
--
a
force
that
lie
in
the
--
in
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
i
think
it's
somewhat
difficult
to
answer,
your
honor.
the
only
rule
that
i
think
should
apply
if
he
can't
be
tried
within
a
reasonable
time
under
the
circumstances,
he
should
be
released.
now,
just
what
is
reasonable
will
depend
on
a
particular
circumstance
of
each
case
is
the
best
answer
i
can
give.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
i
would
also
like
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
--
that
was
part
of
the
evidence,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
he
had.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
they
--
they
did
make
a
report.
their
testimony
is
in
the
record.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
well,
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
they
did
not.
in
fact,
they
both
--
they
testified
that
he
was
sane.
one
of
them
testified
that
he
didn't
know
whether
--
whether
he'd
be
dangerous
or
not.
and
i
believe
the
other
testified
that
he
might
persist
in
criminal
activities
similar
to
what
he
was.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
they're
substantially
the
same
kind
of
--
of
testimony.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
now
the
testimony
of
the
--
of
the
two
psychiatrists,
dr.
(inaudible),
it
began
on
page
20,
on
page
51
and
the
other
on
page
62
of
the
record.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
that
is
right,
your
honor.
i
gave
you
the
pages
in
the
original
transcript,
its
on
page
24
and
30
of
the
--
of
our
record
here.
and
again
referring
to
the
evidence
there
that
was
before
the
court
of
the
hearing
on
july
30th
and
the
testimony
of
dr.
smith
who
was
chief
of
the
psychiatric
staff
there
at
the
medical
center,
their
question
is
set
out
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
“what
you
do
not
find
that
he
had
any
fixed
delusions
concerning
wanting
to
harm
any
person
or
group
of
persons,
officials
of
the
government
or
otherwise.”
answer
-
“no,
counselor,
we
did
not
and
we
pointed
that
out
because
--
and
we
found
evidence
of
such
delusions,
if
he
had
held
fixed
ideas
that
the
government
people
wanted
to
hurt
him
or
if
he
held
ideas
that
he
wanted
to
hurt
the
government,
either
one
might
have
been
construed
is
making
him
potentially
dangerous.”
and
further
testimony,
“if
he
held
the
ideas
that
he
wanted
to
harm
the
government
or
its
instrumentalities
or
perhaps
even
if
we
had
been
able
to
develop
ideas
that
the
government
wanted
to
harm
him,
we
might
have
felt
that
there
was
an
indication
of
potential
dangerousness
but
we
found
neither.”
and
then
dr.
smith
further
testified,
“one
of
the
factors
which
complicates
this
whole
thing
as
it
is,”
this
is
on
page
31
of
the
brief
of
petitioner,
“that
as
you
probably
know
the
hospitals,
everyday
are
releasing
man
of
this
type,
that
is
they
are
turning
them
out
on
the
streets
presumably
at
least
with
responsible
relatives,
that
sort
of
things,
so
that
they
are
certainly
many
schizophrenics
on
the
streets
whose
illness
is
of
the
same
severity
as
the
defendant
here
perhaps.”
so
that
there
is
a
great
pressure
on
their
part
apparently
to
turn
those
men
loose
to
make
room
for
men
that
they
conceive
as
worse.
and
as
judge
whittaker
said
in
--
in
a
case
there,
the
--
in
--
in
the
united
states
district
court,
it
isn't
a
question
of
where
the
--
whether
the
facilities
are
perhaps
better
in
the
federal
prison
or
whether
the
facilities
are
better
as
furnished
by
the
states.
it's
--
it's
a
question
of
a
power
to
restrain
this
man's
liberty.
and
we
respectfully
submit
that's
on
the
record
and
the
facts
that
he
should
be
released
to
the
authorities
in
the
state
of
his
residence
for
further
care
or
custody
as
--
as
the
state
sees
that.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
if
it
please
the
court,
i'm
willing
to
have
just
a
couple
of
minutes,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
--
say
a
few
words
in
conclusion.
of
course,
it
is
not
our
position
and
in
a
respect
that
we
want
to
turn
or
would
cause
to
turn
a
dangerous
person
loose
on
the
public.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
in
this
case
at
least
the
state
of
ohio
that
he
claimed
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
what
should
be
done
with
this
man.
i
thought
it
was
safe
to
release
him
and
we
are
not
taking
the
position.
we
think
that
that's
sufficient
if
that's
the
proper
finding,
if
that's
the
court,
the
probate
court
there
that
have
the
right
to
make
that
finding.
and
i
don't
think
as
justice
frankfurter
has
said
that
we
have
any
right
to
assume
that
the
states
are
unmindful
of
their
responsibilities
in
their
care
of
the
--
of
the
sick
and
of
the
insane.
and
i
think
there
is
a
second
point
that
i
would
--
would
like
to
make
and
that
is
the
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
charges
against
him
are
dismissed
under
his
commitment
and
under
the
provisions
of
it,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
charges
remain
pending
or
not.
he
still
will
continue
to
be
held
by
the
united
states.
mr.
william
j.
burrell
if
--
well,
that
--
that
is
possibly
true,
your
honor,
but
we
did
wish
to
point
out
that
the
provisions
of
his
commitment
are
in
no
way
related
to
the
pendency
of
the
charges
against
him
or
whether
or
not
an
indictment
remains
against
him.
and
for
all
those
reasons,
we
certainly
not
wanting
to
cast
a
man
that's
dangerous
on
the
public,
but
ohio
has
found
him
to
be
safe
to
be
at
large
and
we
think
that
is
--
mr.
william
j.
burrell
thank
you
very
much.
