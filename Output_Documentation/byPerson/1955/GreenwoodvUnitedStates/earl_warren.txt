mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
burrell,
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
used
the
word
"permanent
disability."
is
there
--
is
there
any
--
is
that
issue
before
us,
do
we
have
to
go
to
that
far?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
in
this
case
show
that
this
man
is
permanently
insane?
chief
justice
earl
warren
frankly,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there
were
at
least
two
psychiatrists
who
testified
that
he
was
insane
--
that
he
was
sane.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
right?
so
it
isn't
--
and
the
ohio
authorities
determined
that
he
was
sane,
so
it
isn't
one
of
those
conclusive
cases
of
permanent
insanity
even
if
we
can
say
that
any
insanity
is
--
is
permanent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
point
that
i
make,
mr.
burrell,
is
that
there
is
no
indication
here
that
the
court
considers
this
man
as
being
permanently
and
incurably
insane,
is
it?
they
left
--
they
left
it
open.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
they
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he's
a
very
poor
risk
for
cure
and
so
forth
and
that
he
must
have
indefinite
hospitalization
but
beyond
that
they
do
not
go
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
many
answer
that
after
the
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
done
in
state
statutes
all
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
know
in
one
state
at
least,
the
--
the
finding
the
court
must
make
is
to
the
effect
that
the
person
is
so
mentally
deranged
that
he
is
dangerous
either
to
himself
or
to
others
or
to
his
own
property
or
to
other
--
others'
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
constitutes
a
--
a
valid
holding
of
him
and
sometimes
they
--
they
are
held
along
with
criminals
too
because
some
states
only
have
one
mental
hospital
and
they
keep
both
criminally
insane
and
--
and
the
non-criminally
insane
in
them.
but
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
--
is
--
is
there
any
distinction
between
this
situation
and
the
ones
i
have
mentioned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
burrell,
the
--
the
thing
that
concerns
me
here
is
the
alternatives
that
are
involved
in
this
situation
that
isn't
--
whether
the
government
will
give
this
man
a
trial
for
his
crime
or
release
him
because
the
government
would
be
willing
and
has
shown
his
willingness
to
--
to
give
the
man
a
trial
and
it's
only
because
of
his
mental
condition
that
he
was
prevented
from
doing
so.
now,
what
are
the
alternatives?
and
let's
--
let's
put
it
in
a
little
worst
form
than
--
than
this
case
is.
assume
this
man
is
a
dangerous
criminal,
but
that
--
the
state
that
he
comes
from
neither
has
the
facilities
nor
the
desire
to
hold
him
and
protect
society
and
there
is
this
federal
crime
hanging
over
his
head
for
which
he
has
never
been
tried
before,
its
--
the
government
can't
try
him.
must
--
must
the
government,
if
it
does
not
hold
him
under
this
statute,
release
him
upon
the
public
at
large
so
he
can
commit
any
kind
of
crimes
that
--
that
might
be
addicted
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
--
may
i
pursue
that
just
one-step
farther.
do
you
believe
and
do
you
contend
here
that
he
should
have
been
released
by
the
federal
government
at
the
time
the
ohio
authority
said
he
was
not
insane?
should
they
have
turned
him
loose
and
let
him
go
on
society
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
would
have
--
you
would
take
that
back
to
the
--
to
the
time
that
the
ohio
people
determine
he
was
sane?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
burrell,
assuming
that
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
support
the
finding,
would
you
make
any
distinction
between
this
case
where
the
court
says
that
the
prognosis
is
poor
and
that
it
--
it
will
--
it
cannot
be
told
with
any
definiteness
if
or
when
he
was
--
he
could
be
tried
from
the
case
where
the
court
said,
“we
do
not
believe
that
he
can
be
tried
for
one
year
or
two
years
or
three
years.”
and
then
he
based
that
on
--
on
medical
--
kind
of
medical
testimony.
would
you
make
a
distinction
between
those
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr
burrell.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sixty-one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
sixty-one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
that
--
that
you're
arguing
that
the
constitutional
power
may
depend
on
whether
he
is
dangerous
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
agree
it
is
more
aggravated
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
--
i'm
--
whether
constitutional
power
arises
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
we
long
--
can
we
long
had
a
statute
also
general
that
if
government
employee
overseas
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
becomes
insane
whether
he
commits
a
crime
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
can
--
can
commit
him
for
his
mental
condition
and
hold
him
until
and
unless
the
state
of
his
residence
or
some
other
states
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
are
willing
take
him
over.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
courts
have
held
that
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that's
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
burrell,
the
court
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
you
accepted
this
appointment
from
the
district
court
without
compensation
and
defended
this
man's
rights
in
the
trial
court.
you
accepted
the
same
kind
of
an
appointment
in
the
court
of
appeals,
defended
his
rights
there
and
that
you
come
here
by
our
appointment
and
done
the
same
thing.
we
want
to
thank
you
and
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
the
cause
of
justice
is
always
greatly
enhanced
when
a
lawyer
will
undertake
without
compensation
to
himself
to
defend
the
rights
of
a
--
of
a
helpless
penniless
person.
we
thank
you.
