justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
--
what's
the
special
significance
of
the
use
of
the
word
officers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
some
indication
that
he
had
threatened
the
officers,
the
united
states
officers
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
your
emphasis
on
the
dangerousness
of
the
man
and
the
government
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
dangerous
nature
of
the
man's
character
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
fact
that
he
might
shoot
somebody
or
hurt
somebody
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
has
to
be
combined
in
your
argument
with
the
fact
that
he
is
insane
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
mere
fact
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
may
be
a
dangerous
man
and
the
state
won't
take
care
of
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that's
all
you
have,
the
fact
that
the
government
has
him
and
he's
discharged,
this
--
forget
the
(inaudible)
factor,
the
opinion
of
the
charge.
you
get
up
against
the
question
not
of
a
conflict
of
law
of
a
state
but
whether
the
federal
government
from
insanity
alone
has
power.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
add
one
another
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
other
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
a
pending
charge
against
him
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
may
be
tried
in
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
it
ends,
that
raises
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
is
it
that
that
of
the
question
that
justice
frankfurter
suggested
that
you
have
a
man,
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
try
him
for
violation
of
federal
statutes.
he
is
insane
and
dangerous.
the
government
has
him
there
and
has
the
right
to
hold
him
to
--
to
have
trial
and
the
findings
are
that
--
not
that
he
will
never
get
all
right,
but
that
for
sometime,
not
known,
he
--
the
government
had
him
on
his
hands.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
--
i
can
understand
that.
i
don't
know
what
about
the
other,
but
i
can
understand
that
much
better
than
the
one
after
--
after
the
government
relation
to
it.
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
you
could
throw
out
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
(inaudible)
if
they
were
to
dismiss
and
raise
this
issue.
