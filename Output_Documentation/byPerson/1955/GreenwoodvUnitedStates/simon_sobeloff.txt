mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
burrell
has
so
fully
and
so
fairly
outlined
the
provisions
of
these
statutes
that
i'll
not
take
much
time
on
them,
unless
there
are
some
questions
the
court
wants
to
ask
about
them.
i
think
its
--
it
made
perfectly
clear.
but
i
like
to
say
some
general
things
about
the
statute
and
then
go
to
the
main
point
in
this
case,
the
only
real
point
that's
before
the
court,
the
constitutional
question
that
he
is
raising,
because
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
problem
that
he
raises
is
--
is
one
that
will
appeal
to
the
court
as
requiring
any
reversal,
the
two
courts
having
made
their
finding.
now,
i
don't
suppose
that
any
statute
has
ever
been
brought
before
this
court
for
adjudication
that
has
a
more
distinguished
paternity
than
this
statute.
as
your
honors
know,
it's
the
product
of
very
careful
study
that
lasted
from
1942
to
1949
by
distinguished
committee
of
federal
judges
appointed
by
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
because
of
the
recognition
of
the
existing
problem.
the
chairman
of
that
committee
was
judge
magruder
of
first
circuit,
members
of
that
committee
were
judge
hincks
in
second
circuit.
he
was
a
district
judge.
judge
learned
hand
was
a
member
of
the
committee.
the
file
show
that
these
distinguished
men
didn't
accept
something
that
was
done
for
them.
this
is
not
a
ghostwritten
statute.
it
was
done
by
the
best
legal
and
judicial
brains
in
the
nation
and
done
deliberately
and
whatever
might
be
speculated
about
whether
a
cabinet
officer
had
somebody
presenting
something,
then
he
signs
without
really
concentrating
on
it.
certainly,
these
men
who
corresponded
at
length
and
thought
deeply
about
this
thing
acted
with
deliberation
and
then
they
worked
also
in
cooperation
with
the
department
of
justice,
the
bureau
of
prisons,
mr.
bennett,
and
the
doctors
and
the
administrators
of
the
prison
bureau
and
of
the
mental
hospitals
of
the
united
states,
dr.
overholser,
and
other
doctors.
that
was
a
hearing
which
is
recorded.
you
have
a
testimony.
you
gather
from
that
that
this
has
been
very
well
considered
and
not
only
in
its
administrative
aspects
but
also
the
constitutional
question.
now,
prior
to
1942
and
the
reason
for
the
appointment
of
the
committee,
the
different
judges,
district
judges
were
finding
that
many
men
were
coming
before
them
who
really
ought
not
to
be
brought
before
them
because
of
their
mental
condition.
the
prison
authorities
were
receiving
men
convicted
who
really
ought
never
had
been
put
on
trial.
and
these
officials
were
driven
to
going
through
these
irregular,
unjust,
illegal
gestures
because
there
was
no
particular
--
there
was
no
alternative.
at
least
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
establish
an
orderly
procedure
that
would
set
out
those
cases
that
were
obviously
unfit
for
trial.
one
section
of
this
law
provides
a
procedure
to
deal
with
that
and
other
section
is
to
pick
up
any
mistakes
so
that
if
the
question
was
not
raised
perhaps
because
the
man
did
not
have
proper
counsel
or
any
counsel
and
it's
found
shortly
after
his
admission
to
the
prison
that
he's
really
insane.
there
is
an
orderly
procedure
for
raising
the
question
in
determining
whether
he
had
really
had
due
process.
and
then
the
question
arose
what
ought
to
be
the
order
of
commitment.
as
originally
drawn,
the
statute
simply
said
that
in
that
case
if
a
man
is
found
after
hearing
to
be
insane,
he
should
be
committed.
if
you
look
on
page
61
of
our
brief
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
of
our
brief.
yes,
sir.
section
4246,
whenever
the
trial
court
shall
determine
in
accordance
with
sections
4244
and
4245
of
this
title
that
an
accused
is
or
was
mentally
incompetent,
the
court
may
commit
the
accused
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
or
his
authorized
representative.
that's
where
the
original
draft
stopped.
and
then
you
can
see
it
as
--
in
a
moving
picture,
the
development
of
this
thing
and
the
correspondence
of
the
members
of
the
committee,
until
the
--
the
question
was
raised,
well,
what
do
you
do
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
may
not
be
tried
shortly.
how
are
you
going
to
raise
the
commitment
then?
so
it
was
proposed,
then
this
language
was
added.
it
shall
be
--
he's
authorized
to
be
committed
to
the
attorney
general
until,
at
the
last
three
lines
of
that
page,
until
the
accused
shall
be
mentally
competent
to
stand
trial
or
until
the
pending
charges
against
him
are
disposed
of
according
to
law.
they
felt
to
make
it
constitutional.
they
have
to
put
that
limitation
on.
then
our
attention
was
further
directed
to
the
problem
of
what
do
you
do
with
cases
where
a
man
may
not
be
tried
for
a
very
long
time,
where
it's
indefinite
--
indefinite
duration
of
the
arrangement.
do
you
treat
him
the
same
way?
here
is
a
practical
problem.
you
can't
just
dump
the
man
on
the
street
to
commit
further
depredations,
yet,
there
ought
to
be
some
greater
safeguard
in
a
case
like
that
because
he's
being
committed
for
an
indefinite
time.
so
they
added
this
language,
the
second
--
the
second
sentence
of
this
section
4246,
which
appears
on
the
top
of
page
62,
and
this
is
the
new
language.
and
if
the
court
after
hearing
as
provided
in
the
preceding
sections
4244
and
4245
shall
determine
that
the
conditions
specified
in
the
following
section
4247
exists,
the
commitment
shall
be
governed
by
4248.
now,
what
are
the
conditions
in
4247?
the
conditions
in
4247,
you
see
on
page
63,
that
is
whenever
a
person,
i'm
looking
at
section
4248,
the
--
i'll
read
from
the
beginning,
whenever
a
person
shall
be
committed
pursuant
to
section
--
let
me
first
read
4247
on
page
62,
“whenever
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
shall
certify
that
a
prisoner
whose
sentence
is
about
to
expire.”
now,
you
notice
originally
they
were
thinking
only
of
the
man
who
has
served
his
time
and
they
recognized
that
he's
a
menace
if
left
at
large
and
they
wanted
to
know
what
to
do
about
him.
but
by
the
addition
of
the
five
or
six
lines
in
the
preceding
section,
they
made
these
conditions,
which
are
outlined
in
4247,
apply
also
to
the
man
who
was
not
yet
been
tried
because
of
his
mental
condition.
and
what
are
the
conditions?
if
it
is
found
by
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
that
this
man
who
--
whose
sentence
is
about
to
expire
or
the
man
who
has
been
committed
and
he
can't
yet
be
tried
under
the
other
section,
that
he
is
insane
or
mentally
incompetent.
two,
that
if
released,
he
will
probably
endanger
the
safety
of
the
officers,
the
property
or
other
interests
of
the
united
states.
and
three,
that
suitable
arrangements
for
the
custody
and
care
of
the
prisoner
are
not
otherwise
available,
then
the
attorney
general
shall
transmit
the
certificate
to
the
court
and
the
court
shall
cause
the
prisoner
to
be
examined
by
a
qualified
psychiatrist.
and
then
the
reports
of
the
psychiatrists
are
filed
to
the
court
and
then
there's
a
hearing
and
not
--
and
there
must
be
due
notice
and
he
must
have
the
benefit
of
counsel
and
the
report
of
the
psychiatrist
is
made
available
and
any
other
testimony
is
made
available
on
behalf
of
the
man
or
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
will
bear
on
the
issue.
then,
if
he
is
found
to
be
insane
and
if
these
other
two
conditions
are
present,
they
believe
that
he
is
a
probable
danger
to
some
interests
of
the
united
states
or
its
property
or
its
officers.
and
other
suitable
arrangements
are
unavailable.
if
those
three
conditions
are
present,
then
he
is
committed
under
4248
which
appears
on
page
63
and
you'll
see
that
the
duration
of
the
commitment
is
hedged.
first,
you
can
--
you
keep
him
until
the
--
whichever
event
shall
first
occur
of
these
three
that
until
his
mental
condition
is
so
improved
that
if
released
he
will
not
endanger
the
safety
of
officers,
property
or
other
interests
of
the
united
states
or
until
suitable
arrangements
had
been
made
for
the
custody
and
care
of
the
prisoner,
either
his
sanity
has
restored
or
he's
sufficiently
improved
does
--
no
longer
to
be
in
danger
or
you
have
an
alternative,
a
state
is
willing
to
take
him.
now,
that
was
done
and
in
the
judgment
of
these
members
of
the
committee
that
met
all
constitutional
requirements
even
in
the
case
of
the
man
who
is
indefinitely
ill
and
has
to
be
detained
indefinitely.
of
course,
he
always
has
the
right
to
test
out
the
question
as
to
whether
he's
sufficiently
improved
to
be
discharged.
he
--
he
could
raise
that
on
habeas
corpus.
the
statute
recognizes
that
even
if
the
statute
didn't,
of
course,
habeas
corpus
would
be
available
to
him.
not
only
was
this
draft
passed
on
by
the
members
of
the
committee
but
it
was
circulated
at
the
instance
of
the
conference,
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
among
all
the
circuit
and
district
judges
of
a
country,
20
to
30
of
them
wrote
in
and
making
this
--
that
suggestion,
all
these
things
were
carefully
and
deliberately
considered.
and
the
final
draft
is
what
wasn't
enacted
by
congress.
now,
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
--
first,
the
--
the
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
means
what
we
say
it
means.
the
judges
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
having
before
them
cases
unlike
this
and
that
those
people
were
not
found
to
be
dangerous,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
attempt
to
make
such
a
finding.
they
have
the
ordinary
case.
there
has
been
no
definite
finding
of
dangerousness.
there
has
been
no
enquiry
into
the
availability
of
alternative.
so
it
is
--
and
the
only
section
of
--
the
only
portion
of
4246
that
was
complied
with
was
the
first
sentence
that
didn't
have
these
safeguards.
it
was
on
that
kind
of
a
case
that
the
ninth
and
the
tenth
circuit
said,
“we
do
not
read
the
statute
as
covering
the
case
of
one
in
--
an
indefinite
duration
of
insanity.
to
do
so
--
to
read
it
so
would
be
--
would
raise
great
constitutional
questions.
in
one
case,
the
judge
said,
“i
think
the
man
ought
to
be
discharged
because
the
statute
so
read
would
be
unconstitutional.”
in
other
words,
in
the
case
of
a
person
who
was
not
found
dangerous
and
not
--
and
there
was
no
showing
that
there
was
no
alternative
facilities,
they
said,
it
was
not
enough
for
the
government
to
act.
you
have
here
the
first
reported
case.
there
have
been
six
commitments
under
the
statute,
but
you
have
the
first
reported
case
here,
where
there
was
an
attempt
and,
i
think
with
--
on
--
on
sufficient
basis
to
declare
whether
or
not
there
--
this
man
was
dangerous
and
whether
or
not
there
was
alternative
facilities.
he
was
found
on
the
testimony
of
the
doctors
to
be
a
danger
and
he
was
--
it
was
also
found
as
it's
amply
proven
in
the
--
by
experience
in
this
case
that
ohio
wouldn't
take
him
and
there
was
no
other
place
for
him
to
go.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
think
that
if
he
--
were
not
a
danger.
the
government
would
have
less
latitude
in
dealing
with
him.
there
is
a
greater
responsibility
on
the
government
not
to
discharge
a
man
who
has
shown
a
disposition
to
commit
particular
depredations
and
who
in
the
judgment
of
the
doctors
is
liable
to
repeat
that
conduct.
then,
there
is
in
a
case
of
a
man
who
may
be
insane
in
the
sense
that
he
cannot
properly
cooperate
with
his
lawyer
in
the
defense
and
yet,
it
is
agreed
that
he's
harmless.
in
that
case,
you
can't
just
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
hold
him.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
it's
more
aggravated
case.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
think
we
have
the
constitutional
power
in
both.
but
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
because
there
is
an
indictment
against
him.
he's
committed
a
federal
offense
and
he
is
awaiting
recovery
to
be
tried.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
in
which
case?
are
you
talking
about
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
the
case
here?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i'm
speaking
of
two
alternative
instances.
where
there
is
a
temporary,
a
clearly
temporary
derangement
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
which
is
no
more
--
no
longer
duration
than
the
--
a
case
of
measles
or
something
or
some
other
illness
that
the
man
had.
but,
of
course,
there's
very
little
basis
for
any
question
of
the
--
of
the
government's
power
to
deal
with
it.
the
question
that
they
are
raising
is,
what
do
you
do
in
a
case
where
the
duration
of
this
illness
is
indefinite.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
either
or
indefinite.
i'll
--
i'll
answer
it
this
way.
dr.
overholser
provided
the
answer
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
reed
asked
here
about
the
categories
of
--
of
mental
illness
as
to
whether
there
are
temporary
and
permanent
or
whether
there
are
other
categories.
dr.
overholser
said,
“it's
impossible
to
say
in
most
cases
whether
a
condition
is
permanent.”
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
progress
in
--
in
medical
science
in
recent
years.
some
wonderful
drugs
have
been
discovered
and
used
in
the
last
two
or
three
years,
procedures
that
were
undreamed
off
only
a
few
years
ago
are
now
available
and
helpful
in
many
cases.
so
that
a
distinguished
psychiatrist
as
overholser
says,
that
it's
impossible
to
say
in
many
cases
whether
or
not
a
condition
is
permanent.
and
yet,
you
may
have
a
case
of
such
gravity
that
you
feel
this
man
may
not
be
available
for
trial
for
a
long
time.
this
statute
hedges
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
well
within
the
limits
by
praying
a
proper
deference
to
the
state
and
saying
if
there
is,
in
a
case
of
uncertain
duration,
long
duration
and
uncertain,
a
possibility
of
the
state
taking
him.
we're
not
contesting
with
the
state.
this
is
not
an
instance
of
competing
jurisdictions.
these
are
two
jurisdictions
that
are
--
one
of
them
is
holding
off
and
refusing
to
act.
this
court
has
upheld
many
acts
in
support
of
the
commerce
power
for
instance
and
in
other
instances
where
you
have
the
federal
government
impinging
on
what
would
normally
be
state
action.
and
the
question
arises
as
to
how
far
in
this
competition
between
jurisdictions,
where
do
you
find
the
balance.
you
don't
have
that
problem
here.
you
have
here
congress
saying,
in
any
case
where
the
man
cannot
be
tried
and
he
is
committed,
the
commitment
shall
have
this
limitation
in
it
that
if
there
is
available,
a
state
that
is
willing
to
take
him
surrendering.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
we're
not
contesting.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
but
wisdom
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
sir,
but
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
it
gives
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
the
power
that
--
that
the
united
states
has.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
your
honor,
i'm
not
debating
that
with
you.
on
the
other
hand,
the
fact
that
a
procedure
is
sensible
and
reasonable
doesn't
make
it
unconstitutional
either.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
am
--
i
am
merely
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
the
--
the
only
point
that
i
am
making
is
that
you
don't
have
here
a
clash
of
jurisdiction.
you
have
here
congress
staying
well
within
the
limit
and
saying
that
in
any
case
where
a
man
was
committed
even
after
the
finding
that
he's
dangerous.
if
a
state
is
willing
to
take
him,
surrender
him,
and
in
this
case,
they
actually
did
surrender
him
to
the
state
and
the
state
didn't
want
him.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
your
honor
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
--
i
hope
you
won't
think
presumptuous,
but
don't
you
think
we
better
stick
to
this
case?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
but
this
case
is
not
such
a
case
as
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
will
say
that
there
may
come
a
time,
as
judge
magruder
said
in
his
testimony
before
the
senate,
it's
conceivable
that
in
a
particular
case
there
may
come
a
time
when
under
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
a
fair
trial,
you
can't
delay
it
any
longer.
for
instance,
what
this
court
did
in
the
(inaudible)
case
recently.
you
concluded
that
the
passage
of,
i
think
it
was
10
or
11
years,
and
--
and
to
prove
in
the
absence
of
certain
witnesses
made
it
impracticable
to
conduct
a
trial,
you
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment.
a
court
could
always,
in
a
proper
case,
do
that.
you
don't
have
such
a
problem
here.
i
can
imagine
problems
of
that
sort
arising
in
extreme
cases.
you
don't
have
any
such
thing
here.
you
have
here
a
finding
that
the
man
is
not
presently
triable,
that
his
prognosis
is
bad.
nobody
says
that
he'll
--
he
will
never
be
tried.
this
very
case,
the
man
has
had
remissions.
he
turns
around
and
he's
better
and
then
turns
around
he's
worst,
and
who
has
the
wisdom
and
the
foresight
to
know.
the
doctors
don't
know
and
i
don't
think
that
the
courts
are
called
on
to
speculate
abstractedly
about
a
situation
that's
--
that's
not
before
you.
what
you
have
here
now
is
a
man
to
derange
to
stand
trial.
he
has
twice
held
up
post
offices
by
--
in
armed
robberies.
this
is
not
a
sneak
--
sneak
thief
who
has
come
in
and
just
picked
up
roller
stamps.
he
has
threatened
with
a
gun
the
post
office
clerk.
he
has
done
that
twice.
even
the
doctors,
upon
who
we
don't
particularly
rely,
agree
that
the
likelihood
is
that
he
would
repeat
that
conduct.
he
has
no
specific
hostility
to
the
president
or
to
the
postmaster
general
and
maybe
not
even
to
that
post
office
clerk,
but
he
goes
about
his
business
and
the
business
like
way
with
a
gun.
now,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
specific
hostility.
he
is
still
a
menace.
he
is
still
a
danger.
you
have
a
finding
by
two
courts
that
he
is
dangerous
and
under
those
circumstances
to
say
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
the
state
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
exactly
true.
that's
true.
but
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
for
an
indefinite
time.
now,
when
you
say
the
indefinite
future,
that's
not
permanent
either,
you
know.
it's
indefinite,
it's
indefinite,
nobody
knows.
nobody
knows.
now,
you
may
have
a
case
at
sometime
where
it's
no
longer
fair
to
hold
the
man,
but
even
then,
you
still
have
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
him.
when
the
state
won't
take
him,
do
you
just
dump
him?
is
it
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
exactly.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
we
would
--
we
would
keep
him.
now
--
and
wouldn't
be
an
absurd
result
to
say
that
a
sovereignty
that
has
a
right
to
enact
criminal
laws
and
to
make
arrests
of
violators
and
to
take
them
into
detention,
finding
that
it
can't
proceed
with
a
trial
and
yet
has
the
man
on
his
hands,
as
judge
magruder
says,
we
have
a
bear
by
the
tail.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
for
an
indefinite
period.
and
the
state
has
offered
the
man
and
says,
no,
and
nothing
else
develops.
it's
possible
that
the
state
later
would
take
him,
if
so,
that
would
change
the
situations,
possible
that
the
man
may
have
a
remission
and
would
--
would
no
longer
be
dangerous,
you'd
have
a
different
case,
but
this
condition
continues.
what
must
a
sovereignty
like
the
united
states
do?
can
it
only
dump
him?
can
it
also
make
a
--
a
reasonable
provision
for
his
safety
and
for
the
safety
of
the
public?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
don't
know.
i'd
have
a
closer
case.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i'd
have
a
closer
case.
i'm
not
ready
to
conceive
that
case
either.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
sir.
now,
i'll
tell
you
why,
your
honor.
the
problem
of
an
orderly
disposition
of
this
man
might
still
be
a
valid
reason
for
further
detention.
for
this
reason,
the
fact
that
you're
no
longer
going
to
try
him
because
you're
now
processing
the
case,
it
doesn't
terminate
the
problem
of
the
government
which
has
this
man
in
its
custody.
and
congress
isn't
precluded
from
making
a
sensible
it
and
reasonable
and
i
say
just
a
moral
decision
that
he
shall
not
be
dumped
and
set
at
large
to
commit
further
depredations
against
the
united
states,
against
himself,
against
the
general
public.
it
certainly
is
within
the
competence
of
the
united
states
to
do
that.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that
--
that
is
the
statute
here.
that
is
the
statute.
your
honors
will
recall
the
language
that
i
think
was
used
by
the
court
of
the
hoke
case,
the
case
in
which
the
court
upheld
the
validity
of
the
mann
act
and
the
problem
constitutionally
was
not
unlike
this.
it
was
a
question
of
how
far
the
federal
government
can
enter
into
what
is
normally
a
subject
of
state
regulation
pertaining
to
the
morals,
good
order
and
i
think
it
was
mr
justice
johnson
who
said
and
i
forgot
who
the
justice
is.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
“our
dual
form
of
government
has
its
perplexities,
state
and
nation
having
different
spheres
of
jurisdiction,
as
we
have
said,
but
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
we
are
one
people
and
the
powers
reserved
to
the
states
and
those
conferred
on
the
nation
are
adopted
to
the
exercise
whether
independently
or
concurrently
to
promote
the
general
welfare,
material
and
moral.”
now,
i
don't
derive
a
greater
power
from
the
general
welfare
clause,
but
i
think
that
clause
is
instructive
as
to
how
to
--
to
view
these
several
grants
and
try
to
find
a
--
a
rational
integration
where
possible
and
not
say
that
the
united
states
is
driven
to
doing
what
in
the
judgment
of
these
judges
who
had
practical
experience
with
the
problem
and
the
judgment
of
congress
is
the
only
reasonable
and
fair
and
safe
thing
to
do.
now,
as
has
been
indicated
here,
i
think
that
the
criminal
power
of
the
government
raises
as
a
necessary
corollary
the
right
to
make
provision
for
the
disposition
of
men
who
come
lawfully
into
the
custody
of
the
united
states
or
violating
its
laws
and
that
would
be
sufficient
and
certainly
sufficient
in
this
case.
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
lend
some
support.
judge
huxman
said,
in
his
tenth
circuit
dissent,
he
said
that
common
principles
of
humanity
require
the
government
having
the
insane
person
in
its
custody
not
to
abandon
him
without
some
suitable
provision
preferably
by
surrendering
him
to
the
state,
but
when
the
state
will
not
take
him,
then
in
some
other
manner.
now,
there
are
many
familiar
examples
of
the
government
dealing
with
respect
to
people
that
have
a
special
relation
to
it
in
a
manner
that
it
could
not
deal
with
him
if
they
were
just
members
of
the
general
public.
if
this
were
a
case,
and
i
think
hypothetically,
this
case
was
put
by
a
member
of
the
court
by
mr.
burrell,
if
this
were
a
case,
where
ohio
fails
to
make
a
disposition
of
an
insane
person
within
its
borders
and
the
government
said,
“well,
if
ohio
won't
do
it,
we'll
do
it.”
i
think
we'd
all
unhesitatingly
answer,
that's
ohio's
business
and
not
the
business
of
the
united
states.
but
if
the
united
states
has
a
special
relation
to
this
man,
he
is
coming
to
its
lawful
custody
or
a
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
if
he
shot
a
federal
judge
or
if
he
tried
to
shoot
that
post
office
clerk
even
such
a
nimble
interest
of
the
united
states
is
not
unworthy.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
but
they
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
they
came
out
all
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
but
they
came
out
all
right
in
that
case
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
the
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well,
i
--
the
--
the
hypothetical
case
was
stated
and
i
am
distinguishing
it
from
the
actual
case
that's
before
us.
this
is
not
a
case
of
the
united
states
intruding
to
deal
with
a
citizen
of
ohio
with
whom
it
has
no
special
relation.
we
have
a
very
special
relation
with
this
man
who
has
twice
armed
--
committed
armed
robbery
on
a
post
office.
now,
we've
got
him.
what
do
we
do
with
him?
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
is
not
acting
irrationally
or
arbitrarily
in
saying
committing,
and
especially
when
congress
requires
that
there'd
be
a
specific
finding
of
dangerousness
and
further
requires
that
the
commitment
terminate
if
any
--
if
a
state
is
willing
to
take
him.
now,
there
are
instances
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
right.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
valid.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
and
that
--
that
is
a
recognition
that
where
there
is
a
special
relation
between
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
the
government
and
him,
it
can
--
it
can
deal
with
him
better.
it
can
regulate
--
regulate.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes,
sir.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
oh,
yes,
oh
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
oh,
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
oh,
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
oh,
no,
no,
no.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
no,
no,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
contend
that
there's
a
category
of
a
bad
people
that
you
can
just
pick
up
regardless
of
what
they've
done
only
because
of
what
they
have
might
do.
when
--
when
you
have
got
a
lunatic
who
was
shown
a
disposition
to
enter
post
offices
with
a
gun,
it's
not
an
unreasonable
inference
that
if
discharged,
he's
going
to
repeat
that
kind
of
--
well,
after
the
--
after
the
commission
of
the
crime
in
kansas
city
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
no,
no,
i
--
i
would
conceive
at
once
that
if
--
it
was
just
insanity,
nothing
else.
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
it's
because
having
committed
a
violation
of
federal
law
and
coming
into
the
custody
of
a
government
and
being
dangerous
to
discharge
the
government
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
and
as
--
and
the
state
won't
take
him.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
what
is
the
other,
your
honor?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right.
i'm
willing
for
this
case
to
argue
that.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
conceive
the
other
because
there
may
be
cases
where
--
where
there
--
there
is
still
the
problem,
but
you
don't
come
anywhere
near
that
--
that
problem.
you
don't
come
to
the
verge
of
that
in
here
certainly.
there
is
the
possibility
of
a
trial.
nobody
is
prepared
to
say
that
he'll
never
be
tried
or
never
be
well
enough
to
be
tried.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
your
honor,
i
didn't
suggest
that
hypothesis
and
these
hypothetical
cases
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
--
are
suggested
to
me.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
well
--
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
i
agree
wholly
with
that
and
if
all
that
was
present
was
a
claim
by
the
government
that
the
states
are
indifferent
and
therefore,
we
all
assume
their
role.
i
couldn't
defend
it
but
that's
not
this
case.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
preparing
this
case,
i
--
i
reread
the
mcculloch
case,
and
it
gave
me
a
sense
of
assurance
that
our
approach
is
correct.
the
whole
spirit
of
--
of
that
decision
is
that
you
don't
interpret
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
a
crimping
limited
wayyou
don't
reach
out
for
new
jurisdiction
that's
not
granted,
but
when
a
power
has
been
granted
to
the
government,
anything
that
reasonably
is
desirable,
necessary
in
the
sense
of
desirable
to
execute
that
power
is
within
the
implied
power.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
that's
right.
when
it
ends,
it
raises
a
different
question,
i
--
i
can
see
that.
and
the
question
that
you
got
to
decide
here
is,
does
this
go
too
far.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
does
this
go
too
far?
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
yes.
mr.
simon
e.
sobeloff
he
sees
it.
i
--
i
can
well
see
that
the
--
the
reasonableness
of
that
distinction
and
i'm
not
pressing
for
that
because
it
isn't
necessary
in
this
case.
i'm
just
not
conceding
it
because
i
don't
know
what
--
what
may
follow
in
some
other
case
but
i
can
--
and
i
can
understand
your
reluctance
in
writing
an
opinion
in
a
case
like
this,
not
--
not
to
--
to
leave
it
wide
open.
but
certainly
as
far
as
we
have
to
go
here,
the
court
can
go
with
--
with
assurance.
now,
congress
is
the
judge
of
a
practical
necessity
of
this
measure.
congress
has
acted
on
the
best
advice
that
is
imaginable
in
a
situation
like
this.
it
is
exerted
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed.
it
has
shown
great
deference
to
the
state
if
it
is
willing
to
take
him.
the
findings
of
fact
concurred
in
by
the
two
courts
below
are
entitled
to
respect
and
should
not
be
overwritten
by
this
court,
and
i
think
that
with
great
respect,
i
submit
that
the
pleas
ought
to
be
affirmed.
