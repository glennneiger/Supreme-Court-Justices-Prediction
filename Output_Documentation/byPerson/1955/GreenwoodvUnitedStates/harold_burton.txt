if
you're
successful
in
what
you're
trying
to
do
for
him,
then
what
happens
to
him?
justice
harold
burton
and
that
was
done
once
and
--
and
at
that
time
they
let
him
out?
justice
harold
burton
but
as
soon
as
that
happens,
why
then
you
pick
him
up
again
for
trial.
that's
what
happened
the
other
time
and
--
and
if
he
is
sane
why
he
is
subject
to
trial
so
that
--
if
they
get
him
out
then
normal
course
will
probably
be
that
--
that
he
go
to
trial.
justice
harold
burton
it
is
your
obligation
as
his
attorney
sees
it
when
you
get
him
out
from
this
federal
care
and
turn
him
over
to
ohio.
justice
harold
burton
but
there's
no
doubt
in
your
mind
though
is
there,
that
if
he's
under
indictment,
he's
being
held
for
trial
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
gets
ill,
not
mentally
ill,
but
just
get
sick,
they
can
hold
him
in
a
hospital
until
he
gets
well.
justice
harold
burton
and
so
that
your
question
doesn't
involved
much
as
the
matter
of
original
power
that
doesn't
re
--
on
due
extension
of
the
time
beyond
their
reasonable
chance
of
recovery.
