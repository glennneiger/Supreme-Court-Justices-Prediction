justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
request
admitted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
--
the
record
shows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
record
shows,
they're
dated
october
2.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
instructions
were
given?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
judge
have
before
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
request,
specifically
stated
item
by
item.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
denied
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
jury
was
dismissed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean
he
chose
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it's
accurate
of
the
state
that
he
considered
all
the
requests
that
he
declined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could,
presumably
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pass
judgment
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
rule
an
innovating
rule
or
a
formulating
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
--
was
this
a
--
a
creational,
an
inventing
of
the
rules
and
for
many
adopted
by
this
court?
or
did
it
merely
put
the
new
words
under
common
practice
and
recognized
practices
and
observed
practice
through
the
decision
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
that's
been
merged
here,
297?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
after
the
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
by
the
which
the
rule
used
the
language,
used
to
--
specifically,
whatever
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no
court
of
appeals
thought
ever
to
reverse,
to
cause
an
abstract
question
or
abstract
request
or
request
for
the
abstract
proposition
of
law,
no
matter
how
that
an
abstract
and
wasn't
given.
that
doesn't
help
the
jury
in
the
cycle
to
be
part
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
their
request
is
to
deny
it
here
of
an
abstract
or
legal
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
you'll
also
argue
of
your
entitlement,
that
in
any
event,
it
should
have
been
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
contract
couldn't
been
inclusive.
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
it
--
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spillers,
let's
--
let
us
avoid
the
--
the
bias
of
the
undesirability
of
abstraction
with
regards
to
these
questions,
and
let's
be
concrete
about
this,
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
requests
which
were
not
given
which
the
court
of
appeals
thought
should
have
been
given,
related
to
the
problem
of
contributory
negligence,
do
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let's
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
some
--
if
some
request
vital
to
this
litigation
were
the
--
were
not
given
and
should
--
should
have
been
given
then
the
court
of
appeals
was
right.
and
that
now
is
the
setting
exactly
in
this
case.
is
that
true?
three
of
them
is
enough.
one
of
them
would
have
been
enough,
if
it
--
if
it
--
both
is
essential
to
the
litigation.
namely,
whether
the
defendant
has
contributory
negligence,
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
in
view
of
the
course
of
the
trial.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
request
was
directed
to
him.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
now,
that
issue,
that
concrete
confidence
was
tended
in
the
answer
very
specifically.
and
that
was
the
subject
matter
of
extended
examination
and
cross-examination
at
the
trial.
it
wasn't
as
though
the
request
injected
some
new
abstract
legal
questions.
that's
what
the
litigation
was
about.
that's
what
the
fight
was
about.
and
one
reads
this
record.
so,
it
wasn't
something
new
to
the
request,
i
suppose.
these
request
put
into
words
what
was
the
issue
throughout
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
question
is,
whether
you
did
not
have
sufficient
notice,
as
a
matter
of
--
of
the
discretionary
judgment
that
belongs
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
to
us.
whether
there
wasn't
sufficient
notice
given
to
the
court,
to
the
district
court,
without
saying,
to
tell
this
man
these
words,
i
object,
because
you
didn't
give
the
request.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
how
in
our
life
we
can
appreciate
the
way
to
what
you're
saying.
but
we
ought
not
to
discuss
this
question
in
abstract
or
on
its
own
for
a
practical
thing
and
as
though
you
must
do
some
words
when
you're
out
of
court,
one
way
or
the
other.
that
is
what
the
rules
are
for.
and
the
rule
46
explicitly
prevented
from
being
so.
not
51,
but
51
and
22.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
must
be
argued
all
over
again?
must
we
argue
a
request?
i've
known
some
of
the
ablest
trial
judges
who
refused
arguments,
who
refuse
to
listen
to
arguments.
that
it's
a
bore
to
request
because
they
said
if
it
requires
argument
and
it
isn't
sufficiently
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
much
but
--
but
the
statement,
is
(inaudible)
put
in
the
request
that
was
submitted.
that's
what
the
request
for.
and
that's
why
the
rules
require
they'd
be
given
in
advance
of
the
judge's
charge.
as
against
the
old
method,
the
careless,
sloppy
method,
whereby
a
trial
judge
made
the
charge,
may
counter
that
up
and
said
i
want
your
honor
to
charge
this
and
your
honor
to
charge
that.
that's
all
how
it
was
properly
done.
because
that
was
a
nice
word
concluding
the
jury
and
rubbing
out
the
impression
the
trial
judge
had
made
upon
their
mind.
and
now,
the
rules
require
that
in
good
times,
you
submit
your
request
which
supposedly,
tell
the
judge
what
you
want,
requires
no
elucidation
thereafter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
happens
to
be
the
burden
to
put
on
the
district
court
if
it
objects?
do
you
think
it's
too
heavy
a
burden
in
a
(inaudible)
read
your
proper
or
proper
request,
i
still
think
it's
a
heavy
a
burden
on
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
agree
to
a
proper
request
that
indeed
that
it
contradicted
a
--
a
charge
or
a
failure
to
make
a
charge,
in
this
charge
of
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
--
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
got
to
say
and
went
on
that
ground
with
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
that
the
decision
of
that
court
they
did
so,
it
connection
with
rule
46
by
saying
a
portion
of
the
field
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
was
erroneous
to
decide
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
--
that
the
the
decision
of
the
court,
let's
say,
it
was
clearly
let's
say
that
gave
the
district
judge
notice
what
they
were
talking
about?
and
you
must
not
include
the
explicit
words
to
the
explicit
language,
presumably
federal
judges
are
then
are
competent
in
the
responsibility
and
come
in
courage
to
come
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
not
an
unfair
assumption
to
make
it
as
this
establish
exactly
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
a
brain
tickles
nobody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
other
side
of
it
is
--
the
other
side
of
it
is
that
--
that
i'm
not
to
prevent
something
to
present
the
theories
as
a
result
of
this,
there's
some
responsibility
under
the
trial
judge
particularly
in
the
federal
court
with
all
its
authority
in
ruling,
indicting
the
jury
on
facts
despite
of
the
hierarchy
to
--
not
to
dismiss
a
thing
out
of
hand
and
ask
counsel,
why
do
you
make
this?
what
--
well
this
is
reason
is
flawed.
and
would
then
--
maybe
the
counsel
didn't
know
of
this
regulation.
this
was
the
day
before
the
federal
registry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spillers,
let
me
ask
you
--
we
had
a
groping
in
that
day
of
what
was
plain
and
reinvent
the
(inaudible)
that
was
all
i
know
about
the
case,
is
that
it
was
plain
enough
if
there
was
any
alert
and
in
fact
the
responsible
judge
would
--
wouldn't
just
say
â€œno,
i
won't
give
that.
he
--
he
stirred
the
problem.
there's
some
no
responsibility
on
the
district
judge
not
disposing
of
this
out
of
hand,
without
finding
out
what's
behind
that
inept
formulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
--
the
upside,
the
other
way
around
it,
if
the
case
would
be
lost
on
--
on
what
(inaudible)
plainly
much
is
the
fault
of
lawyers
on
technicality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all
the
point
was
raised,
and
because
they
didn't
raise
them
in
the
proper
way,
that
was
true
in
the
old
days,
when
--
-when
(inaudible)
every
good
hand
was
very
willing
to
bid
for
use.
if
you
don't
use
that
word,
you're
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
the
amount
of
(inaudible)
court,
legal
procedure
to
implement
your
fair
so
as
to
include
the
litigant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
matter
of
substance
is
what
you
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
mind
of
the
judge.
that's
your
matter
of
substance.
if
you
haven't,
want
anything
to
his
mind,
of
course,
not
in
his
logic
area.
but
if
you
had
brought
something
to
his
mind
and
especially
what
have
you
brought
to
his
mind
and
you
think
he
wasn't
put
on
notice.
and
the
manner
of
the
formal
words
you
put
him
on
notice
aren't
all
on
the
record
as
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
want
you
to
have
if
you
want
the
course
of
this
litigation
was
that
this
record
disclosed.
the
issue
in
its
the
request
was
denied
improperly
as
the
court
of
appeals
found.
for
the
question
went
to
the
heart
of
the
litigation,
namely,
the
contributory
negligence
of
the
plaintiff.
that
was
the
heart
of
the
controversy.
that's
what
the
answers
tended
as
the
issue
--
and
that's
for
--
and
that
was
the
burden
for
you.
reading
this
record,
there
are
pages
and
pages
of
pleadings
with
that
act
you
have
the
same
(inaudible)
getting
suits
and
they're
getting
suits
congress
was
with
the
lower
court
arbitrary
primitively,
for
such
a
negligence
in
contributory
nature
--
contributory
negligence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
just
there's
been
non
of
the
--
in
other
words,
if
--
if
you
are
right,
that
this
was
an
incidental
matter,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
incidental,
it's
essential.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
context
was
whether
the
request
which
the
defendants
asked,
or
a
request
considerably
and
you
in
the
light
of
the
evidence,
and
while
one
taken
out
of
the
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
brief
this
part.
you're
not
--
in
your
brief,
has
this
court
granted
the
petitions
unrestricted.
in
your
brief
--
in
your
brief
is
sustained
or
reversed
the
judgment
on
the
ground
that
in
any
event
the
requested
charge
looked
referring
to
these
charges
were
not
requested,
were
not
given
more
properly
if
we
get
to
it.
you
don't
--
don't
think
that
in
your
brief,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
do
and
i'm
wrong.
you
do
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
right
about
that.
and
we
don't
get
to
the
point,
do
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
the
conflict
is
very
much
less
than
your
brief
indicates.
this
one
goes
into
the
particularity
of
the
indigent
cases
and
that
if
i
may
suggest
this
for
myself
it's
very
bad
for
this
court
to
lay
down
fixed
rules
for
the
account
of
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
suggest
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
may
be
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
question
that
i
know
in
rule
51
was
that
whether
the
request
were
improperly
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
not
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
that's
not
the
answer
to
this
though.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judgment
may
be
to
--
the
judgment
may
be
sustained
by
--
i
mean
the
arbitral
use.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
sustained
by
the
following
gives
us
on
any
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cantey,
it's
not
without
interest,
at
least
to
me,
historically,
that
the
phrases
that
because
they're
often,
they're
policies
of
justice
black
to
tell
you,
state
your
fixed,
it
doesn't
matter
before
this
is
as
i
gather
from
reading
mr.
justice
stone's
opinion
in
u.s
against
atkinsons
451
to
be
in
existence
that
is
that
it's
indicated,
you
lay
down
the
general
rule
with
all
of
high
points
before
that
time,
i
believe
goes
on
to
say,
namely,
perhaps
to
have
--
they
must
be
held
it's
within
the
duty
of
the
judge
to
put
the
issue
with
the
jury.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
it
is
substantial
to
that
adopted
by
rule
10,
something
that
is
one
of
the
rules
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
decision
is
very
effective
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
requires
the
party
acceptance
of
the
charge
to
state
distinctly
the
federal
matter.
evidently,
that's
what
is
to
me
the
--
the
current
fray
of
the
statement
that
he
was
doing
as
a
friend
of
the
rule
that
is
put
into
rule
51.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
carry,
any
weight
if
it
was
before
the
court
--
specialize
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
no
constitutional
duties
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
confused
--
entered
in
the
chief's
chronology.
i
don't
think
we
recommend
it.
