chief

we'll
recess
now,
mr.
spillers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
42,
victor
d.
gibson
versus
lockheed
aircraft
service,
incorporated.
mr.
spillers,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
general
practice
in
your
circuit,
mr.
spillers,
on
--
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cantey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
cantey,
as
i
read
the
record
on
page
288
and
page
299,
i
don't
see
that
you
ask
this
witness
of
what
the
custom
was
in
the
--
in
the
industry.
you
say
to
the
court,
"your
honor,
this
company
has
been
charged
with
performing
their
work
carelessly
(inaudible)"
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
order
to
determine
the
standard
of
care
to
be
used
in
this
particular
situation,
it
depends
upon
the
standard
of
--
of
aircraft
repairs
and
manufactures
and
we
are
using
the
custom
among
the
aircraft
industry
generally.
i
wish
to
show
it
by
this
witness
that
the
methods
used
by
this
defendant
were
the
same
methods
used
by
the
air
force
and
airlines
and
aircraft
manufactures.
then
your
question,
referring
back
just
a
few
lines
is
this.
and
this
is
your
own
witness
and
employee
of
your
own
firm.
question
"in
view
of
your
experience
would
you
say
that
the
operation
that
(inaudible)
for
the
repair
and
inspection
of
these
airplanes,
how
did
it
compare
with
other
methods
used
in
the
aircraft
industry
generally?"
the
answer
is,
"it
is
my
honest
belief
that
we
have
a
maintenance
setup
there,
a
very
high
standard
as
compared
with
any
other
similar
work
that
i
have
performed
before.
our
help
had
experienced
most
of
them
in
the
jobs
where
we
needed
the
experience
and
i
think
we
had
a
well-organized
maintenance
crew
there,
mr.
cantey.
that
is
all,
thank
you."
now,
is
that
ask
the
custom
that
prevailed
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
industry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
those
are
the
pages
you
pointed
out
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
us.
so,
my
--
that's
the
reason
i
read
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
question
and
answer
didn't
--
wasn't
responsive
to
your
statement
about
the
--
about
the
custom.
you
didn't
ask
him
about
the
custom.--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
didn't
answer
about
the
custom.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
goes
all
because
you've
said
that
that
is
all
after
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
after
he
answered
it.
it
looks
though
you
were
satisfied.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
the
witness
say
what
custom
was
among
other
--
in
the
industry
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
i'll
--
i'll
find
it
for
tonight.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
roughly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
that
true
at
the
time
when
he
asked
if
you
had
any
exceptions
to
--
to
offer
would
--
wouldn't
that
invite
some
statement
from
you
at
that
time
instead
of
just
saying
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
"no.
i
only
--
only
my
--
only
my
instructions,
could
you
not
have
said
then
we
--
we
feel
that
you
have
not
adequately
instructed
the
jury
or
followed
our
proposed
instructions
on
subject
of
--
of
a
contributory
negligence
or
whatever
it
was."
could
you
not
have
pointed
it
out
then
to
the
judge?
of
course,
you
wouldn't
have
tried
his
patience
in
answering
his
question,
i
hope.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
was
his
purpose
in
asking
you
that
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
your
time
--
your
time
is
not
up
yet,
mr.
you
will
get
five-minute
signal
from
that
white
light
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
the
red
light
when
your
time
start
here.
