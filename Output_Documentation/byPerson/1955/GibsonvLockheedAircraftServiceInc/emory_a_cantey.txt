mr.
emory
a.
cantey
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
here
is
simply
this.
the
petitioner
urges
upon
this
honorable
court
a
construction
of
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
that
is
rigid,
inflexible,
and
undeviating.
the
respondent
urges
upon
this
honorable
court
a
rule
of
construction
that
is
in
accord
with
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
rule
in
order
that
justice
might
be
done.
we
do
not
consider
that
this
rule
is
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
we
do
not
consider
that
that
is
the
purpose
of
its
existence.
the
language
of
the
rule
is
clear,
but
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
rule
is
equally,
is
clear.many
cases
in
the
lower
court
have
written
decisions
on
the
intent
and
purpose
of
rule
51.
they
all
state
the
same
thing.
the
purpose
of
rule
51
is
to
preclude
assignment
of
error
that
were
not
fairly
and
timely
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
now,
this
is
a
civil
case
of
course,
but
with
the
indulgence
of
the
court
i
would
say
that
it
has
some
aspects
of
the
criminal
nature
as
far
as
i
personally
am
concerned
because
we're
not
trying
with
my
client.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
my
client
didn't
get
a
fair
trial.
i'm
the
one
that's
being
tried.
i
tried
this
case.
and
the
argument
of
petitioner
is,
that
i
did
not
fairly
and
timely
apprise
the
trial
judge
of
the
errors
which
i
--
that
might
be
in
his
charge
or
of
the
instructions
that
i
wanted
him
to
make.
the
petitioner
says
that
the
rule
is
inflexible.
you
either
comply
with
it
or
you're
lost.
no
matter
that
your
client
did
not
get
justice,
no
matter
that
your
client
did
not
get
a
fair
trial,
but
if
you
get
caught
in
that
trap,
then,
your
client
has
no
further
recourse.
now,
in
urging
upon
this
honorable
court
that
they
construe
rule
51
in
accordance
with
its
intention
and
purpose,
at
least
i'm
in
good
company.
the
intent
and
purpose
of
rule
51
has
been
interpreted
and
written
upon
by
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
virginia
stage
case,
in
the
holland
tactics
case,
by
the
second
circuit
in
wright
versus
farm
journal
and
the
famous
sweeney
v.
united
kingdom.
in
the
third
--
third
circuit
in
the
case
of
green
versus
reddy,
in
the
fifth
circuit
by
the
case
of
lumbermens
versus
hutchins
and
the
two
atlantic
coastline
cases.
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
williams
versus
powers,
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
jacobs
versus
fidelity
&
deposit
of
maryland,
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
(inaudible),
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
swiderski
versus
moodenbaugh.
none
of
the
other
circuits
have
held
otherwise.
they
are
vacant.
what
i'm
saying
that
those
circuits
have
construed
rule
51
by
looking
to
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
rule
and
have
not
when
it
became
before
them
and
says,
"rule
51
says
this,
that's
it,
regardless
of
what
may
have
happened
at
the
trial."
now,
here
is
what
happened
at
this
trial.
if
we
are
going
to
construe
this
rule
in
accordance
with
its
intent
and
purpose,
which
is
the
argument
that
i'm
attempting
to
make.
here
are
the
facts
in
the
record
that
would
show
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
was
fairly
and
timely
advised
of
the
matters
which
the
fifth
circuit
said
precluded
my
client
from
having
obtained
a
fair
trial
in
the
trial
court.
in
the
first
place,
there
were
two
main
defenses
as
is
obvious
from
the
reading
of
our
pleadings
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out.
there
were
specific
acts
of
contributory
negligence.
and
there
was
also
pled
the
doctrine
of
volenti
non
fit
injuria.
in
the
first
place
at
the
pretrial
conference,
on
the
motion
to
strike,
the
doctrine
of
volenti
was
thoroughly
discussed.
and
the
court
refused
at
that
time
to
strike
it
from
the
defendant's
answer.
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
evidence
on
contributory
negligence
in
specific
situations
was
testified
too
by
many
--
many
witnesses.
one
of
the
defenses
which
was
pled
was
--
had
to
do
with
the
texas
law
on
custom.
the
--
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
at
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
on
custom,
opposing
counsel
objected
most
vociferously.
this
is
not
in
my
brief
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
like
to
indulge
in
through
the
course
pointed
out.
on
page
288
of
the
record,
opposing
counsel
objected
to
evidence
on
custom.
the
court
said,
"the
objection
seems
to
be
well
made,
i
will
hear
you,
mr.
cantey."
your
honor
this
company
has
been
charged
with
performing
their
work
carelessly
had
filed.
in
order
to
determine
the
standard
of
care
to
be
used
in
this
particular
situation,
it
depends
upon
the
standard
of
care
of
aircraft
repairs
and
manufacturers
and
we
are
using
the
custom
among
the
aircraft
industry
generally.
i
wish
to
show
by
this
way,
that
the
method
used
by
this
defendant
were
the
same
methods
used
by
the
air
force
and
airline
and
aircraft
manufacturers.
now,
this
is
the
point
of
law
that
says
that
it
came
up.
i
then
stated
then
if
that
be
negligence,
according
to
law,
they
would
have
to
prove
that
the
whole
examination
was
negligent.
now,
i
think
that's
a
misprint
and
means
operation.
as
long
as
we
were
up
to
the
custom
in
the
aircraft
industry.
the
court
then
following
that
in
the
record,
stated
that
he
agreed
with
the
opposing
counsel
and
disagreed
with
me
as
to
that
proposition
of
law,
but
he
would
let
it
in
as
evidence.
that
is
exactly
one
of
the
instructions
that
was
requested
by
respondent,
that
proposition
of
law,
that
if
it
is
a
standard
custom,
you
must
prove
the
custom
is
negligent,
which
is
the
texas
law.
and
that
is
one
of
the
instructions
that
was
refused
by
the
trial
court
and
one
of
the
instructions
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
deprived
my
client
of
a
fair
trial.
and
before
the
case
was
fairly
undertaken,
the
trial
judge
understood
exactly
the
proposition
of
law
that
i
was
attempting
to
make.
now,
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
answer
you
on
the
charge
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
if
the
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
your
honor
that
is
based
on
a
supreme
court
case
in
the
state
of
texas
followed
by
a
subsequent
case.
there
are
some
arguments
in
the
brief
between
counsel
on
it.
there
was
then
a
third
case
the
compress
versus
whittington
case
which
is
cited
by
my
brother
here,
in
which
he
said
it
was
overruled.
but
it
was
not
overruled
in
my
opinion.
the
latter
case
merely
said
that
that
doctrine
of
taylor
versus
white,
which
a
texas
supreme
court
case,
should
be
confined
to
a
particular
situation
which
was,
if
the
custom
was
universal
and
that
fact
was
uncontradicted
in
the
record
then
this
doctrine
applies.
now,
we
proved
by
many
witnesses
that
the
method
employed
by
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
the
same
method.
it's
a
particular
method
called
the
"workbook
method"
that
was
used
in
the
united
states,
ireland,
england,
by
all
of
the
allied
planes
during
world
war
ii
in
their
repair
and
maintenance
basis
and
by
the
united
states
government.
now,
it's
--
it's
our
position
that
if
they
had
offered
one
witness
of
any
other
aircraft
repair
in
the
world
that
used
a
higher
standard
of
care,
we
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
this
doctrine,
this
--
this
doctrinal
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
no,
sir.
i
--
perhaps
i
don't
understand
you
but
i
would
think
it
would
be
this
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
i
think
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
perhaps
so,
but
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
the
jury
could
find
that,
just
the
same
as
if
the
custom
for
the
purpose
of
illustration
had
been
the
no
inspection
was
had
whatsoever.
but
we'd
--
we'd
have
come
in
there
and
say,
"well,
that's
all
right.
nobody
else
ever
inspects
airplanes."
why
didn't
the
--
the
jury
in
applying
the
test
of
an
ordinary
prison
man
under
the
same
and
similar
circumstances
could
have
said,
"well,
we
think
the
custom
is
negligent."
therefore,
we
could
hold
his
defense.
that
i
think
is
what
this
proposition
of
law
is
aimed
at.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
the
coca-cola
case,
sir?
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
and
then
you've
let
the
(inaudible)
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
sir?
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
if
it's
a
case
that
i'm
--
i
think
you
referring
to,
mr.
justice
clark,
it's
the
--
the
case
on
(inaudible)
which
was
pled
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
in
its
original
petition
but
which
was
stricken
by
the
court
in
a
pre-trial
conference
and
held
by
the
trial
court
not
to
apply
that
the
doctrine
(inaudible)
did
not
apply
in
this
situation
and
it
was
abandoned.
it
has
never
been
raised
in
the
appellate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
no.
no,
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
justice
clark.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
coca-coal
case
on
the
custom.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
now,
i
believe
that
it
--
that
is
correct.
there
is
coca-cola
case
were
they
proved
that
they
bottled
their
drinks
just
like
everybody
else
and
that
that
was
a
custom
of
bottling
industry
generally,
beer
companies,
coca-cola
companies,
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
evidentiary.
but
that
is,
to
get
back
to
the
proposition
that
i've
just
said
and
was
referenced
to
mr.
justice
black,
it
is
limited.
this
old
taylor
versus
white
supreme
court
case
has
now
been
limited
to
the
particular
situation.
that
is
were
you
prove
that
that
custom
is
at
is
universal
and
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
record
denying
it
that
there's
no
--
it
stands
uncontradicted
in
the
record
to
see
if
--
if
they
could
put
on
any
--
any
evidence.
in
this
case,
one
--
one
witness,
has
said
that
if
there
was
anybody
in
the
world
that
you've
been
with
a
higher
standard
of
care,
our
propositional
law
would
have
dropped
out.
we
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
this
because
the
taylor
versus
white
is
limited
to
that.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
no.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
mr.
chief
justice,
that
does
not.
but
the
record
contains
a
lot
of
other
testimonies
that
does.
the
three
aircraft
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
right.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
your
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
pointed
out
that
page
288
merely
to
show
in
connection
with
this
rule
51's
purpose
that
i
had,
that's
in
the
trial
brought
up
my
--
my
interpretation
of
the
legal
proposition
that
subsequently
was
given
to
the
court
in
the
form
of
a
requested
instruction
merely
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
but
sir
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
no,
sir,
he
did
not.
that
witness
did
not
at
that
particular
instance.
he
did
not.
but
my
--
and
i
say
my
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
yes
sir.
i
was
with
that
witness.
but
i
had
referred
to
that
particular
part
of
the
record
merely
to
show
that
the
judge
knew
early
in
the
trial
that
what
my
proposition
of
law
was
and
they
are
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,the
--
there
were
several
witnesses
on
it,
sir.
there,
that
i'd
say,
the
three
aircraft
inspectors
from
the
united
states
air
force
testified
it
was
the
same
as
used
in
--
by
the
air
--
united
states
air
force
and
other
aircraft
industries
and
in
fact
came
from
the
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
an
index
here
but
i
--
i
can
state
to
the
court,
sir,
that
--
that
testimony
is
in
there
in
the
form
that
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
there
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
you
say
307
mr.
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
(inaudible)
was
one
of
them.
on
357,
i
asked
this
aircraft
inspector,
"how
do
--
method
used
by
lockheed
aircraft
service
had
filed
compare
with
others
of
your
acquaintance?"
and
he
says,
"almost
identical."
and
he
had
discussed
earlier
what
his
acquaintance
was
with
the
aircraft."
is
it
used
by
other
companies?"
--
on
the
bottom
of
page
357,
"yes,
sir."
"and
is
it
used
by
the
government
itself,
the
same
system?"
"very
roughly.
yes,
sir."
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
that's
not
too
good
an
answer
[laughter].
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
but
i
--
i
think
you'll
find
the
testimony
in
--
in
there,
sir.
so,
now,
if
i
may
sir
is
that
satisfactory
to
your
discussion.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
i
was
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
sir
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
it's
--
it's
quite
important
and
of
course
while
i
can't
turn
to
it
right
this
minute,
i
know
the
testimony
is
in
there,
sir.
and
i'm
--
that's
why
i'm
confident
of
it.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
it
is
important.
but
it's
the
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
do
understand
that,
sir.
and
i
would
certainly,
like
all
the
strings
to
my
bow
that
i
could
have.
i
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
there's
--
on
page
241,
a
cross-examination
by
an
adverse
witness
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
i
asked,
"you
have
worked
for
several
aircraft
corporations,
haven't
you?
just
work
for
two
of
them?"
"yes,
sir"
it's
a
squawk
sheet
system,
the
customary
method
of
determining
the
discrepancies
between
the
flight
crew
and
the
ground
crew?"
"yes,
sir."
that
is
a
standard
operational
procedure
in
an
air
craft
you
have
worked
for?
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
i
think
it's
one
of
the
most
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
--
important
charges
--
that
was
the
key.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
and
one
of
the
ones
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
that
was
reversed.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
that
was
the
one
where
i
asked
if
the
plaintiff
was
negligent
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
his
test
flights,
not
to
be
found
by
one
of
his
test
flights
where
the
testimony
showed
that
he
--
gas
fumes
were
reported,
and
he
admitted
in
his
testimony
that
although
gas
fumes
were
reported
to
him,
he
did
not
report
in
the
squawk
sheet
and
it
was
his
sole
and
only
responsibility
to
do
so.
and
that
was
one
of
the
requested
instructions
on
negligence
as
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
it.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir,
discrepancy
report.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
did,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
except
for
this,
mr.
justice
clark.
the
testimony
showed
that
that
was
the
procedure
which
was
in
use.
and
that
was
the
--
the
way
that
this
defendant
knew
of
any
defects
obtained
on
the
plane.
and
the
--
the
squawk
sheets
were
introduced
in
evidence.
and
it
was
shown
that
on
the
day
in
question
that
he
signed,
that
is
the
plaintiff,
a
squawk
sheet
which
he
had
to
do
on
each
test
flight
in
which
he
noticed
a
couple
of
other
minor
things
and
it
was
absent
in
gas
fumes.
for
that
purpose
in
my
mind
a
little
different
light.
and
he
--
he
himself
rendered
a
record
signed
by
himself
a
discrepancy
report
which
did
not
disclose
gas
fumes
which
was
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir,
he
did.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
that
--
that's
what
they
said,
sir.
but
on
that
second
flight
that
there
was
a
squawk
sheet
signed
by
him
and
that
goes
to
the
way
of
the
testimony.
and
we
feel
that
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
on
it,
because
we
had
implanted
affirmatively
and
had
raised
it
by
the
evidence
and
shown
by
cross-examination
that
he
said
that
was
the
method
that
is
employed
and
he
didn't
sign
it.
and
that
he
did
fail
to
note
it
on
the
squawk
sheet
and
that
it
was
his
responsibility
to
do
so.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
sir,
number
11,
sir.
according
to
the
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
instruction
number
11.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
in
texas,
that's
--
that
procedure
is
indulged
in,
in
the
federal
courts
for
acting
universally
due
to
the
fact
that
texas,
the
state
of
texas,
has
a
special
issue
submission
in
every
case
of
negligence
that's
tried
in
the
state
court
in
texas,
is
submitted
on
special
issues
which
you
have
to
--
in
which
you
have
to
split
it
out
in
the
way
you're
discussing,
mr.
justice
black.
the
--
an
ordinary
automobile
accident
case
on
issues
of
damage
and
contributory
negligence
usually
contains
40
to
50
special
issues
for
that
reason
that
each
act
of
negligence
are
contributory
negligence
is
divided
up.
was
this
act
negligence
and
was
it
approximate
cause?
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
mr.
justice
black,
the
judge
does
not
charge
that
way
in
texas.
he
cannot
make
any
general
charge.
that
would
be
reversible
error
in
itself.
he
only
submits
to
the
jury
a
charge
of
special
issues.
he
does
not
submit
any
type
of
general
charge
that
is
on
the
conduct
generally
except
to
define
terms
such
as
definition
of
negligence
and
definition
of
approximate
cause.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
and
the
definition
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
now,
that
practice
varies.
most
plaintiff's
attorney
prepare
the
charge
in
the
state
courts
because
a
lot
of
times
it'd
be
out
in
a
small
district
where
a
judge
won't
be
expected
to
be
an
expert
on
some
particular
law
that's
brought.
and
that
many
judges,
however,
won't
allow
either
party
to
assist
to
be
making
their
charge.
they
want
to
do
it
themselves.
so,
it's
not
enough
standard
in
that
respect.
but
i
would
say
generally
the
--
the
plaintiff's
attorney
assist
the
court
in
the
charge
and
the
defendant's
attorney
requests
an
issue,
but
it's
more
or
less
what
they
use
as
a
petition
as
the
framework
under
what
credit
they
take
the
petition
which
does
allege
specific
acts
of
negligence.
and
then
the
judge
sees
that
the
evidence
raised
it,
why
didn't
he
know
that
a
special
issue
should
be
submitted
on.
and
that's
the
way
it
does
in
many
cases
in
the
district
court
in
texas.
the
judge
--
the
federal
judge
submits
the
case
on
the
special
issues
with
no
general
charge
whatsoever.
in
the
northern
district
of
texas,
i
would
say
that
most
workmen
compensation
cases
are
submitted
that
way.
they
use
practically
the
same
system
as
in
the
state
court.
and
they
--
they
ask
the
jury
to
come
back
and
find
a
special
issue.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
it's
the
presiding
judge
is
the
--
the
honorable
t.
whitfield
davidson
who
tried
this
case.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
now,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
pass
on
to
just
what
happened
in
this
case
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
couple
of
questions.
i
was
--
i
did
try
the
case
myself
and
i
--
i
think
i
do
know
and
i
do
know
what
the
practice
is
in
the
fifth
circuit.
and
i
think
it's
important
here.
it
is
the
practice
in
the
fifth
circuit
for
requested
instructions
to
be
submitted
to
the
trial
judge
in
federal
courts
before
the
judge
prepares
his
charge
for
his
aid
in
assistance
in
doing
so.
and
it
is
also
the
custom
at
that
time
and
the
practice
and
was
done
in
this
case
to
submit
copies
to
opposing
counsel.
the
requested
instructions,
in
this
case,
bare
the
same
date
as
the
last
day
of
the
trial.
the
trial
judge
advised
this
counsel
and
as
to
sometime
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
he'll
say,
"i
would
like
to
have
you
--
the
counsel's
requested
instructions
by
noon
tomorrow,"
which
means,
of
course,
that
that's
the
point
where
he's
going
to
--
to
prepare
his
charge.
and
he
wants
the
instructions
there.
and
that
was
done
in
this
case.
and
at
the
time
that
judge
davidson
prepared
his
charge,
he
had,
with
these
--
all
of
these
requested
instructions
with
him.
and
that
--
that's
obvious
from
the
record
because
they
were
all
signed
by
him
and
all
noted
and
at
the
time
that
he
gave
his
charge
and
then
--
and
then
immediately
call
for
objections,
that
there
was
further
discussion
between
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
and
counsel
and
--
and
the
trial
judge
which
is
very
important
in
this
case
for
this
reason.
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
objecting
to
the
fact
that
the
judge
was
contributing
too
much
on
contributory
negligence.
and
the
judge
pointed
out
to
him
and
it's
in
this
record,
"no,
you
misunderstood
me.
i
read
the
defendant's
answer.
you'll
note
from
the
charge
that
first
he
reads
the
petition.
then
he
reads
the
answers
which
contained
all
of
these
charges
and
defenses."
and
then,
he
charged
the
jury
and
he
pointed
out
to
petitioner's
counsel
at
that
time,
"no.
i
didn't
charge
on
all
of
these
contributory
negligence.
i
merely
read
the
defendant's
answer
to
the
jury."
and
then,
he
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well
it's
right
at
the
--
in
here
i
can
turn
to
it
very
briefly,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
then,
well,
that
nor
the
portion
i'm
talking
about
is
on
page
--
yes,
sir.
378.
and
then
the
counsel
for
petitioner
said,
"judge
you
--
you've
charged
on
the
doctrine
of
volenti
non
fit
injuria
where
assumption
of
the
risk,"
and
which
we
had
urged
in
this
case.
and
the
judge
says,
"no.
i
have
--
again,
i
read
that
from
the
answer
but
i
did
not
charge
it."
and
he
goes
on
to
say
the
trial
court
does,
"i
only
gave
four
of
the
defendant's
specially
requested
instructions."
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
he
says,
"i
gave
only
four
of
them."
now
only
--
the
only
--
the
--
of
the
four
that
he
gave,
there
was
only
one
that
had
to
do
with
contributory
negligence.
of
the
four
that
he
gave,
he
gave
unavoidable
accident
and
he
gave
a
charge
that
the
defendant
was
not
being
sure
and
then
he
gave
one
about
--
they
did
touch
on
one
picture
of
contributory
negligence.
but
that
whole
discussion
was
there.
and
at
the
end
of
that
discussion
in
which
the
judge
demonstrated
that
he
had
--
had
read
these
charges
and
knew
which
ones
he
was
given
and
what
they
applied
to
and
understood
what
he
was
charging
on
--
on
contributory
negligence,
there
wasn't
very
much
left
for
counsel
for
defendant
to
say
except
to
make
his
formal
exception
to
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
give
the
requested
charges.
now,
i
knew
at
that
point
that
judge
davidson
knew
--
judge
--
i
knew
that
judge
davidson
knew
that
--
that
--
all
about
these
charges.
that
he
had
read
them,
studied
them,
and
fully
understood
them.
and
judge
davidson
knew
that
i
knew
that
when
he
called
for
my
exception.
now
--
now,
i'm
--
i'm
just
beyond
arguing
and
i
--
i
realize
that.
but
i've
spent
considerable
time
in
the
northern
district
of
texas.
and
i
--
i
hope
this
court
would
indulge
me,
if
i
say
it
may
have
been
some
number
of
years
since
the
honorable
members
of
this
court
were
engaged
in
the
actual
trial
at
a
--
at
the
trial
court
level.
but
i
know
that
it's
composed
of
practical
men
and
i
know
they'll
understand
me
when
i
make
this
statement
that
if
i
had
--
had
continued
after
the
judge
had
told
me,
"i've
marked
--
refused
the
requested
instructions
that
i
did
refuse."
if
i
had
been
--
continued
to
orally
lecture
judge
davidson
on
why
his
charge
was
defective
and
why
i'm
not
respected
in
requesting
the
instructions
should
be
given,
i
would
have
been
trying
his
patience.
now,
if
that's
not
a
fair
statement,
well,
it's
just
this
because
you
don't
know
judge
davidson.
i
--
i
think
that
i
would
have
been
trying
patience.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
--
i
made
that
statement
and
i
--
and
i'm
sincere
about
it.
that
i
feel
that
at
that
point
i
would
have
tried
his
patience
by
going
any
further.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
he
had
already
discussed
it
and
he
had
stated
to
me,
"i
have
marked
the
"refuse"
the
ones
i
have
refused.
now,
the
fact
that
what
he
meant,
of
course,
was
that
he
had
signed
his
name,
"t
whitfield
davidson"
written
on
there
accepted
a
rejection.
now,
the
mark
is
important
in
this
case
because
when
the
--
the
term
that
judge
davidson
used,
when
i
said
i
accept,
was
i
have
marked
them.
now,
marking
those
exceptions
didn't
serve
any
useful
purpose
until
the
trial
of
that
case
at
that
point.
the
trial
of
the
case
at
the
trial
court
level
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
these
special
requested
instructions
being
marked
"refuse"
by
the
trial
judge.
the
only
purpose
it
could
have
had
and
it's
obvious
that
that's
what
the
judge
meant
was
that
he
had
marked
them
and
signed
them
and
ordered
that
the
counsel
could
preserve
it
for
review
by
a
higher
court.
that's
the
only
purpose
he
could
have
of
--
for
which
he
could
have
made
that
remark.
and
the
purpose
of
rule
51,
as
i
have
said,
is
to
timely
call
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
anything
that
you
might
complain
of
in
the
higher
court.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
they're
very
--
i
think
that's
very
easy
to
answer,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
--
it
would
have
been
because
of
this
reason.
if
my
requested
instruction
had
been
covered
by
the
charge
that
he
didn't
give,
in
other
words,
if
he
had
touched
on
them,
maybe
not
to
my
satisfaction
but
where
i
knew
that
they
were
these
particular
acts
of
contributory
negligence
were
discussed
and
in
the
main
charge.
then
if
he
had
called
for
exceptions
to
the
defendant
and
i
had
said,
the
defendant
has
no
exception,
it
would
have
indicated
to
the
judge
that
i
felt
that
he
had
covered
it
in
a
charge
and
that
i
was
waiving
any
exception
to
it.
now,
mr.
justice
black
asked
about
the
charge
that
the
court
actually
gave.
the
court
actually
gave
a
--a
charge
that
covered
only
one
act
of
contributory
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
plaintiff
and
the
circuit
court
in
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
states
that
in
their
opinion
on
page
384
of
the
record
where
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
found.
it
says
this,
the
only
issue
as
to
contributory
negligence
from
the
defendant's
standpoint
which
the
court
presented
was
that
of
plaintiff's
miscalculation
of
his
distance
or
the
height
from
the
ground.
the
charge
as
given
only
presented
that
one
contributory
negligence
feature.
and
our
whole
case
as
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
on
page
377?
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
i
think
so.
i
think
perhaps
the
fifth
circuit
man
may
have
been
an
error
in
that
and
i
am,
too,
then
in
the
--
in
the
repeating
here.
but
i
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
and
then
he
pointed
out
in
this
discussion
that
after
he
asked
for
exceptions
that
all
he
was
doing
there
was
just
reading
the
pleading
and
you'll
notice
from
the
charge
that,
that's
the
way
he
presses
it
when
he's
reading
it
to
the
jury
says,
"i'll
--
this
is
what
the
plaintiff
contends
and
this
is
what
the
defendant
contends.
now,
i'm
going
to
charge
you
this."
and
there
it
began
and
only
there
it
began
in
the
court's
charge.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
know
that
this
court
is
--
does
not
feel
itself
and
should
not
feel
itself
too
completely
bound
by
decisions
of
the
lower
courts.
but
i
--
i
do
want
to
--
to
point
this
out,
about
the
decisions
that
do
exist
on
the
question
which
we're
considering.
there
--
there
are
some
120
decisions
on
rule
51.
and
if
you
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
because
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
observed
awhile
ago,
you
will
find
that
they
are
not
in
disagreement.
and
i'd
like
to
say
this
in
reference
to
another
question
that
was
asked.
this
rule
comes
from
supreme
court
rule
8,
as
near
as
i
can
find
it,
which
was
a
rule
that
said
you
couldn't
assign
an
objection
to
the
charge
unless
the
objection
has
pointed
out
the
particularity
of
the
error
in
the
charge.
and
then
when
51
was
written,
they
added
the
part
about
requested
instructions.
and
they
said
that's
also
true
about
requested
instructions.
now,
that
point
is
important
to
my
mind
for
this
reason.
there
is
one
group
of
cases
that
holds,
if
you
make
a
blanket
or
formal
exception
to
the
charge,
for
instance,
let's
say
that
the
judge
charged
at
length
on
the
doctrine
of
last
clear
chance
and
the
lawyer
got
up,
and
when
he's
called
for
exception
and
then
he
says,
"i
--
i
object
to
your
honor's
charge
because
there's
an
incorrect
charge
on
last
clear
chance."
there
the
--
a
number
of
cases
that
hold
that
that
kind
of
an
objection
to
the
charge
as
given
that
the
blanket
of
exception
is
not
sufficient.
and
i
agree.
and
i
think
that's
right
because
that
doesn't
point
out
to
the
judge
in
what
way
the
charge
that
he
gave
is
wrong.
there
is
another
group
of
cases
in
which
there
were
exceptions
requested
of
the
court
and
no
exception
was
taken
when
the
time
came,
when
the
trial
court
called
for
them.
that's
the
case
of
(inaudible)
by
blair
versus
collins.
and
there's
a
number
of
cases
that
hold
that
that
is
not
confirmed.
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
those
cases.
the
third
group
of
cases,
is
the
one
like
the
case
here
at
bar,
where
there
was
requested
instruction
where
the
court
did
know
the
point
that
counsel
was
making
and
understood
it
and
an
exception
was
taken
to
inform
the
judge
that
the
point
would
be
preserved
for
appeal.
now,
when
you
divide
the
cases
into
those
three
groups
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
--
it's
a
--
that
you're
not
splitting
hairs
when
you
do
that
because
there
are
three
different
situations.
when
you
divide
them
into
those
three
groups,
there's
almost
completely
unanimity
of
opinion
amongst
the
lower
courts.
and
i
think
that
the
reason
for
that
is
apparently
it's
because
the
lower
courts
have
had
no
trouble
in
discovering
the
intent
and
purpose
of
this
rule
and
given
of
--
of
that
situation,
you
can
apply
the
purpose
of
rule
51
to
it
and
judges
don't,
i
don't
think
would
ever
disagree
about
it,.
the
--
the
--
when
you
divide
them
into
those
different
groups,
there's
almost
98%
accord
in
most
all
of
the
cases.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
no,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
no,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
there's
now
--
that's
--
that's
a
two
(inaudible)
instructions
that
are
in
that
rule.
that
they're
distinct
--
that
they
distinctly
state
the
matter
which
you're
objecting
to
and
to
the
ground.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
all
right.
i'm
saying
that
if
the
court
gives
a
charge
and
you
say
or
--
or
will
say
on
the
doctrine
of
last
clear
chance.
and
you
get
up
and
say,
"
i
object
to
the
court's
charge
on
the
doctrine
of
last
clear
chance."
that
that's
not
sufficient
because
although
it
pointed
out
what
you're
objecting
to,
that
is
the
doctrine
of
last
clear
chance,
it
doesn't
give
the
grounds
of
your
objections.
it's
not
--
it's
--
that's
not
enough
or
because
that
just
an
objection
to
the
charge
as
such.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
no,
sir.
certainly,
i
am
not.
i
--
a
note
to
that.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
certainly
not.
you
would
have
to
do
more
than
that,
naturally.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
it
is.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
all
right,
sir.
i
--
i
think
in
this
way.
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
well,
will
--
it's
dealt
that
to
me.
and
i
think
you
are
talking
about
just
the
wording
of
it.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
you
request
an
instruction
on
contributory
negligence
on
the
--
in
this
case
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
--
only
in
this
case,
the
--
the
failure
of
the
pilot
to
turn
around
and
come
back
to
the
field
and
note
the
discrepancy
report
when
he
--
when
he
noticed
gas
fumes
on
the
flight
that
caused
this
accident.
and
where
he
admitted
in
his
testimony
that
his
was
the
sole
responsibility
of
doing
that.
all
right.
i
request
an
instruction
on
that.
now,
that
instruction
is
merely
an
--
an
instruction
on
the
proposition
of
law
that
if
you
have
pled
a
defense
and
the
evidence
raises
it,
you're
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
it
to
the
jury
if
you
request
it.
now,
that's
the
standard
proposition
of
law
in
the
federal
court.
now,
i
say
that
on
that
type
of
instruction
where
i
asked
for
an
instruction
on
that
face
of
the
case,
that
there's
no
question
but
what
the
--
the
judge,
the
federal
judge
understands
the
proposition
of
law
involved.
of
course,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
says,
there
are
men
of
--
of
some
intelligence
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
--
and
that's
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
[laugh]
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
i
think
that
the
charge
we
have
in
mind
in
--
in
this
case
is
in
that
category.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
when
i
submit
to
him
that
written
charge
on
that
simple
proposition
where
there's
no
involved
legal
theory
present
at
all,
just
a
simple
written
instruction
on
the
question
of
contributory
negligence
that
eight
witnesses
have
testified
true
at
the
trial.
then,
i
don't
think
that
judge
needs
any
further
education
as
to
what
--
what
the
attorney
that
submitted
that
written
instruction
is
asking
for.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
--
that
goes
to
my
whole
argument,
mr.
justice
black.
if
you
are
going
to
construe
this
rule
rigidly
and
inflexibly,
it
does
not.
if
you're
going
to
construe
this
rule
in
accordance
with
its
intent
and
purpose,
it
most
certainly
does,
because
its
intent
and
purpose
is,
that
there
won't
be
errors
assigned
that
were
timely
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
and
i
think
that
might
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think
that
--
that
rule
10,
subdivision
(1)
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
almost
word
per
word
of
rule
8
of
the
supreme
court.
it
was,
according
to
my
investigation,
was
the
basis
for
rule
51
that
we're
discussing
here
today.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
saying
to
this
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
i
would
like
to
illustrate
what
you're
talking
about
and
i
--
i
by
making
this
type
of
--
of
argument
and
i
--
i
assure
you
it
is
not
sufficient.
and
if
in
regard
to
some
of
the
questions
at
least
one
them
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked,
"what
--
what
would
you
do?"
and
mr.
chief
justice
also
asked
why
i
didn't
go
farther.
well,
this
--
this
record
is
cold
and
its
silent.
and
it's
lifeless.
it
does
show
that
--
that
the
--
the
judge
called
for
exceptions
at
4:45.
it
shows
that
he
instructed
both
sides
that
he
was
going
to
adjourn
that
court
at
5
o'clock.
and
when
they
called
for
exceptions
from
the
defendant,
that
you
can
tell
by
the
--
what
had
transpired,
it
must
have
been
pretty
close
to
5:00.
now,
if
i
had
objected
and
said,
"now,
your
honor
i
want
to
read
the
special
instructions
that
you
have
refused
over
again,
i
will
take
the
first
one,
special
instruction
number
1."
i
think
judge
davidson
would
have
said,
"i
have
already
read
that.
i
understand
what
number
1
is
and
i
have
marked
it
refuse."
"now
--
now
judge
i've
got
to
comply
with
rule
51
and
i
want
to
tell
you
why."
mr.
cantey,
"i
have
already
told
you
that
i
have
marked
those
refused
that
i
did
refuse
and
i
don't
want
to
hear
anymore
about
it."
well,
or
the
judge
under
rule
51
i've
--
at
that
time
he
had
said,
"mr.
cantey,
you're
fined
$50
for
contempt
of
court"
and
i
don't
think
i
would
have
gone
any
farther
than
that.
now,
if
that
had
happened
and
this
is
the
reason
i
say
that's
my
position.
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
situation
that
we're
talking
about
here
if
you're
going
to
adopt
the
argument
that
petitioner
counsel
is
making
here.
it's
the
same
thing
mr.
justice
black
is
talking
about.
if
that
had
happened
this
record
would
still
not
contain
any
literal
compliance
with
the
language
of
rule
51.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
(inaudible)
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
rule
46
says
that,
but
you
must
remember
that
petitioner's
argument
in
this
case
is
and
must
necessarily
be
so,
that
rule
46
is
a
general
rule
and
that
rule
51
is
specific.
and
that
rule
51
should
not
be
construed
in
connection
with
rule
46.
he
has
to
say
that
because
of
every
case
that's
construed
--
construed
rule
46
with
51
has
interpreted
51
in
the
same
way
that
i
am
asking
this
court
to
interpret
under
these
set
of
facts
and
even
sets
of
facts
that
go
far
beyond
mine.
and
so
he
necessarily
has
to
make
that
--
that
type
or
argument.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
the
posture,
sir?
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
if
this
court
affirms
the
judgement
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
case
is
--
will
be
retried.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
yes,
sir.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
well,
our
--
our
only
argument,
for
instance,
if
it
was
to
a
jury
on
the
question
that
you're
asking
is
this
--
would
be
this.
that
--
and
was
this.
the
testimony
of
--
from
the
plaintiff's
witnesses
were
extremely
vague.
they
said,
"well,
didn't
you
report
the
gas
fumes?
well,
we
saw
--
we
he
saw
him
working
on
the
plane
down
there
and
i
think
they
were
working
on
one
of
the
wing
sails
and
which
is
part
of
the
fuel
system
and
we
told
them,
"we
--
we
smell
some
gas
fumes
there,
but
i
could
see
that
you're
working
on
that
part
of
the
plane."
that
was
after
the
plane
had
been
returned
to
lockheed
and
after
he
was
working
on
it.
whereas
the
evidence
shows
completely
uncontradicted
that
there
was
a
system
and
it
was
complied
with
in
every
instance,
except
this
one
time
when
he
just
failed
to
put
it
on
the
squawk
sheet.
if
that
was
the
method
that
was
used
and
the
plaintiff's
witnesses
and
include
the
plaintiff
himself
justified
it
and
sure
that
was
the
method
they
used
and
sure
i
used
them,
and
sure
i
signed
the
squawk
sheet
even
on
that
day
containing
some
other
things.
but,
i
don't
know
why
i
--
i
didn't
put
it
on
there
because
i
thought,
in
fact,
the
testimony
in
the
record
is,
"i
thought
it
was
on
the
squawk
sheet."
and
when
he
saw
it
at
the
trial
court
he
says,
"i'm
surprised.
i
thought
it
was
in
the
squawk
sheet.
"
that's
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
no.
we
had
no
word
of
it
on
that
thing,
sir.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
i
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
oh,
that
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
i
understand
that,
sir.
and
i
--
i
will,
somewhere
between
the
two
recommendations
of
that
[laughs]
--
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
--
we
turn
it
off.
mr.
emory
a.
cantey
that
i
--
[laugh]
i
won't
do
that.
bring
--
i'll
bring
up
this
other
point
the
third
in
our
brief.
and
i
only
touch
on
it
that
--
to
see
the
doctrine
of
volenti
was
relied
on
quite
heavily
by
the
defendant
here,
because
we
thought
we
had
a
perfect
situation
of
it
where
the
test
pilot
which
was
employed
for
that
purpose
gets
in
on
the
plane
and
gas
fumes
are
noted.
and
he
says,
"well,
i
guess
i
could
have
taken
the
plane
back
and
had
it
rechecked,
but
i
decided
to
go
on."
and
when
he
did,
the
plane
crashed.
and
there's
no
question,
absolutely,
but
whether
it
applies
in
texas,
absent
the
master
servant
relationship.
so,
we
pled
it
and
we
got
all
the
testimony
that
we
could.
we
requested
instructions
on
it
and
the
court
refused
them.
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
they
didn't
rule
on
whether
it
was
applicable
or
not
because
they
said
our
instructions
were
not
correct.
well,
there
were
two
instructions
on
volenti
and
both
of
them
had
been
copied
out
of
the
supreme
court
decisions
word
per
word
and
that's
where
we
made
our
mistake
because
by
doing
that,
we
got
them
below.
it's
too
general
for
the
fifth
circuit.
and
so,
the
fifth
circuit
said,
"well,
they
weren't
correct.
so,
we
won't
rule
on
them."
but
there
are
cases
that
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to,
montgomery
versus
virginia
stage
lines
and
fuller
versus
king
and
others
that
have
held
that
well,
that
is
one
of
the
main
issues
of
the
case.
and
i
think
that
the
doctrine
of
--
of
volenti
in
this
case
certainly
is
one
of
the
main
issues.
that's
one
of
the
main
issue.
that
if
an
instruction
is
requested
and
although
that
instruction
is
not
absolutely
correct,
if
it's
sufficient
to
call
to
the
court's
attention,
the
doctrine
you
want,
why
then,
if
the
court
is
in
error
in
not
giving
it,
why
it's
reversible
error.
and
mr.
justice
minton,
when
he
was
--
in
the
seventh
circuit,
wrote
an
opinion
in
o'donnell
versus
elgin
explaining
just
exactly
advocating
the
doctrine
that
i'm
advocating
now
and
had
done
much
better
language
than
i
could.
and
we
think
that
this
case
should
be
reverse
and
--
and
we
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
doctrine
of
volenti
non
fit
injuria
which
would
denied
us
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
and
although
our
instruction
was
not
absolutely
correct
according
to
the
fifth
circuit,
which
is
only
meant
but
they
said
so,
why
it
was
sufficient,
clearly
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
of
the
main
questions
in
the
case.
and
therefore,
we
would
like
to
bring
that
up.
now,
in
closing,
i
--
well,
to
borrow
us
some
language
from
an
abler
counselor
that
i
am
which
expresses,
i
think,
very
clearly
the
--
the
doctrine
of
the
rule
of
--
of
construction
that
we're
urging
on
this
court
in
this
case.
and
with
the
indulgence
of
mr.
justice
black,
i'd
like
to
read
this
language
from
the
case
of
hormel
versus
helvering,
which
is
exactly
the
argument
that
i
have
so
poorly
attempted
to
make
here
today.
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
are
devised
to
promote
the
ends
of
justice,
not
to
defeat
them.
they
are
rigid
and
undeviating,
judicially
declared
practice
under
which
court
of
review
would
invariably
and
under
all
circumstances
decline
to
consider
all
questions
which
had
not
previously
been
specifically
urged
would
be
out
of
harmony
with
this
policy.
orderly
rules
of
procedure
do
not
require
sacrifice
of
the
rules
of
fundamental
justice.
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
that
my
client
did
not
get
a
fair
trial.
and
if
this
court,
this
honorable
court
wishes
to
lay
down
some
rule
for
the
future
guidance
of
lawyers
practicing
in
this
country,
i
submit
that
does
not
alter
the
fundamental
justice
of
my
client's
position.
they
did
not
get
a
fair
trial
and
they
are
entitled
to
one
and
their
attorney
who
made
the
mistake
was
following
the
plain
rules
of
his
own
circuit,
the
plain
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
his
conduct.
and
for
that
reason,
we
very
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit.
thank
you.
