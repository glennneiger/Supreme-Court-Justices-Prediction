that
has
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
--
you
haven't
said
that
yet.
i
--
i
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
i
can
see
what
you
said
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
taking
your
position
that
the
jury
was
properly
instructed
on
contributory
negligence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
even
if
these
had
been
given,
they
were
to
have
been
mere
interpreted
that
the
--
the
jury
was
properly
instructed
on
that
subject?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
that
your
position?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
rejecting
the
suggestion
that
possibly
that
the
case
might
be
decided
on
the
other
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
looking
for
that
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
mean
i'm
looking
at
this
charge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you
refer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
charge
which
you
refer
on
page
383,
cited
in
the
--
at
footnote
in
court's
opinion?
that
maybe
--
that
--
that
struck
me
as
a
rather
unusual
charge
there,
that
you
didn't
ask
for
them
to
charge,
that
if
the
custom
was
the
--
if
that
was
negligent
but
you
asked
them
to
charge
as
if
they
had
discussed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
unless
they
found,
the
custom
was
negligent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
negligence
of
a
custom
was
under
the
party.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
a
jury
of
(inaudible)
in
that
particular
charge,
how
could
a
jury
determine
whether
the
custom
was
negligent?
now,
they
could
determine
whether
--
the
--
the
first
part
of
their
charge
whether
the
repair
work
in
question
was
performed
in
accordance
to
standard
custom.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
then
would
they
go
further
and
decide
whether
that
custom
was
negligent?
was
there
anything
else
in
your
charge
which
would
have
pulled
them
how
to
decide
that
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
--
what
i
meant
was
if
--
i
don't
know
whether
you
have
it
there
now.
but
i've
always
--
it's
always
been
a
rule
that
charge
must
be
complete
in
itself.
it
must
not
be
the
pleading
or
confusing
or
leave
out
a
necessary
element.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
you
--
this
charge,
which
seem
to
me,
would
leave
the
jury
up
in
the
air
as
to
when
a
custom
was
negligent
or
not
are
not
negligent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
particular
charge.
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
any
charge
on
the
squawk
sheet
system?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
got
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
was
the
one
--
is
that
one
of
135?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
rule
in
texas
that
that
some
charges
like
this
generally?
can
you
pick
out
all
part
--
particles
of
the
evidence
either
party
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
ready
for
defendant.
say
if
you
find
so
and
so
and
if
you
find
that
negligence
and
if
you
find
that
approximately
contributed
to
the
injury
that
--
can
you
split
it
up
in
--
into
parts
like
that
on
defective
procedure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
have
a
right
--
they
have
a
right
to
do
that
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
to
reverse
this?
it
legal
to
know
that
trial
judge
may
have
a
charged
fully
and
completely
--
no
practical
--
practical
definition
if
you
find
any
conduct
at
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
violates
these
rules.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
--
well,
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
he
--
does
he
suppose
of
his
own
accord
just
to
pick
at
different
pieces
of
evidence
charge
if
--
that
you
find
here
and
if
you
find
this
as
negligence
and
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
the
district
judge
in
the
northern,
i've
forgotten?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
tried
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
if
you
don't
know
what
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
i'll
find
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
see
if
--
i
understood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
looking
now
at
this
part
of
the
rule.
it
says,
"no
party
may
assign
in
their
early
giving."
unless
he
does
it
fully
and
duly
charged
stating
distinctly
the
matter
to
which
he
objects
on
the
grounds
that
he
had
objected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that,
that
that's
limited
to
the
older
charge?
is
that
your
idea
about
it?
is
that
the
way
it's
generally
understood?
justice
hugo
l.
black
according
to
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
the
charge
alone
without
anything
being
said
by
the
lawyer
may
be
sufficient
to
comply
with
this
part
of
your
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
well,
what
do
you
have
to
do
in
your
judgment?
i
am
not
asking
this
in
a
hostile
attitude
because
i
--
the
common
sense
way
seems
to
me
to
be
a
little
different
from
the
way
this
the
language
seems
to
sound.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
do
you
say
in
your
judgement,
is
sufficient
to
comply
with
this
provision
which
requires
something
is
rather
surprising
to
me
is
it
is
required
but
it
is
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
when
--
when
the
instructions
are
asked
before
you
can
get
any
benefit
from
an
assignment
of
error,
you
must
first
show
that
you
have
distinctly
called
the
court's
attention
to
it
before
they
left
which
i
suppose
you
would
say,
means
more
than
just
asking
the
charge.
i
--
i'm
--
i
was
as
i
expected
and
the
jury
state,
well
all
we
did
was
to
ask
the
charges.
that
settled
it.
that
was
enough
but
this
seems
to
say
more.
now,
how
do
you
comply
with
that
in
your
judgment?
can
you
--
without
distinctly
calling
his
attention
to
each
separate
charge
and
saying,
well,
you
ought
to
give
it
for
this
reason?
can
you
get
the
benefit
of
it
under
this
rule.
and
if
so,
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
like
what
you
have
here.
i
want
to
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
agree
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
we
have
always
been
brought
up
to
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
how
do
you
get
around
the
fact
if
this
rule
says
that
you
must
state
it
distinctly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
just
rest
on
the
fact
if
the
charge
itself
ought
to
be
enough
to
show
a
man
with
reasonable
intelligence
what
you
asked
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
think
that
just
merely
offering
the
charge
is
enough
to
comply
with
the
provision
that
the
rule
should
be
concluded
that
way.
that
provision
which
says,
that
he
must
object
and
state
distinctly
the
matter
to
which
he
objects?
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he's
stating
that
by
asking
that
written
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
say
that
he
doesn't.
but
the
question
is,
"well,
let's
comply
with
that
rule,
should
it
be
construed
as
to
say
that
there's
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
"can
you
do
it?"
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
my
understanding
about
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
fifth
circuit
before
the
--
before
this
rule
was
adopted
as
applied
to
the
older
charge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
here
gets
down
to
whether
that
can
be
limited
to
that
under
the
language
of
the
rule.
and
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
say
that
as
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
one
who
believed
(inaudible)
that
these
rules
have
solved
those
problems
of
lawyers
or
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
that
i
--
i
don't
know
it
has
--
it
wouldn't
settle
it
at
all,
what's
in,
under
the
old
practice.
there
again
if
you
didn't
tell
the
judge,
you
want
to
object
and
he
cut
you
off,
then,
you
could
raise
the
objection
in
the
upper
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
same
as
though
you
had
stated
your
objection.
