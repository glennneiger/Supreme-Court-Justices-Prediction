mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
may
the
court
please.
this
matter
before
the
court
is
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
action
as
it
originally
rose
was
a
tort
action.
the
plaintiff,
victor
d.gibson
was
a
civilian
pilot.
the
defendant,
lockheed
aircraft
service
incorporated
was
engaged
in
aircraft
repair
business
among
other
businesses.
it
was
the
contention
of
the
plaintiff
that
he,
as
a
civilian
ferry
pilot,
while
flying
a
b-29
bomber,
which
has
been
repaired
by
the
defendant
corporation,
was
injured
in
a
crash
of
the
plane
which
resulted
from
the
negligent
repair
of
that
plane
and
the
reconditioning
of
it
per
flight
by
the
respondent.
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
favor
of
the
petitioner
for
$70,000
damages.
as
a
requisite
for
overruling
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
trial
court
required
a
remitted
due
of
$20,000,
which
was
complied
with
by
the
petitioner.
the
principal
or
chief
point
as
we
conceive
it
in
this
appeal
is
a
construction
of
rule
51
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
facts
briefly
out
of
which
this
action
rules
are
these,
since
world
war
ii,
since
about
1945,
the
b-29
bomber
in
question,
together
with
other
bombers
have
been
into
open
air
storage
that
pilot
army
are
based
in
texas.
in
1951,
when
this
injury
occurred
to
by
the
plaintiff,
the
federal
government
had
determined
to
take
those
planes
out
of
storage
and
recommission.
it
employed
the
respondent
in
this
case
to
repair
and
recondition
them
for
a
flight
from
texas
to
marietta,
georgia
which
was
a
major
repair
and
reconditioning
base.
the
plaintiff,
as
a
civilian
pilot,
was
employed
to
ferry
fly
this
plane
to
marietta,
georgia.
there
was
no
contractual
relationship,
however,
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent,
nor
that
the
relationship
of
master
and
servant
exist
between
them.
the
respondent
had
repaired
the
plane,
presented
it
to
the
petitioner,
and
his
crew
assured
them
that
the
plane
was
in
airworthy
condition.
the
petitioner
then
took
off
from
the
base
and
flew
approximately
an
hour
and
half
and
to
a
point
about
20
minutes
east
of
fort
worth
by
a
flying
time
when
it
was
suddenly
discovered
that
in
the
rear
bomb
bay,
the
bomb
bay
is
being
in
tandem,
there
were
heavy
gas
fumes
indicating
a
gas
leak
in
the
plane.
the
plaintiff
or
petitioner
immediately
undertook
all
emergency
measures
in
order
to
minimize
the
damage,
the
danger
of
explosion
or
the
plane
catching
on
fire.
he
opened
the
bomb
bays
to
ventilate
the
plane,
cut
off
all
electrical
circuits
in
the
plane
which
might
cause
a
spark
and
an
explosion,
except
those
which
were
absolutely
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
motors
and
determine
to
make
an
emergency
landing
at
carswell
air
base.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
directed
by
the
army
to
land
it.
in
coming
in
for
a
landing
as
he
approached
the
landing
strip,
his
controls
failed.
his
evidence
showed
that
the
plane
caught
on
fire
as
it
came
over
to
lake
worth
just
immediately
prior
to
the
runway.
as
a
result,
when
he
pulled
back
on
the
controls,
the
controls
didn't
respond
due
to
some
damage
caused
by
this
fire.
and
as
a
result,
the
plane
hit
an
embankment
on
the
far
edge
of
lake
worth,
jumped
about
40
feet
or
skidded
onto
the
runway
and
proceeded
down
the
runway
about
1800
yards
where
it
came
to
a
stop
on
--
in
flames.
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
in
indiffereing
to
escape
from
this
burning
plane,
fell
on
the
runway.
on
his
back,
broke
his
back,
severely
damage
his
shoulder
and
gave
him
other
serious
and
permanent
damages
with
the
result
that
he
is
a
man
approximately
48
or
46
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
injury.
he's
rendered
unemployable
in
his
previous
profession
as
a
pilot,
which
he
had
followed
all
his
life.
he
had
about
8000
hours
of
flying
time
of
which
2000
hours
were
in
b-29
bombers.
now,
to
close
of
the
evidence,
the
respondent
did
not
move
for
a
directed
verdict.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
and
at
the
close
of
the
court's
instructions,
after
the
jury
had
retired,
and
the
respondent
had
requested
22-request
instructions
of
the
trial
court,
the
trial
court
gave
three
and
denied
the
balance
or
19-request
instructions.
after
the
jury
retired,
the
court
asked
the
respondent
if
it
had
any
exceptions,
and
at
that
time,
counsel
for
the
respondent
said
only
this,
“i
have
no
exceptions,
except
those
which
are
covered
by
my
requested
instructions,
which
were
refused."
that's
the
only
objection
made
for
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
give
19
requested
instructions.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
this
objection
was
utterly
insufficient
under
rule
51
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
provides
in
part,
the
part
with
which
we're
here
concerned
as
follows.
no
party
may
assign
as
error,
the
giving
or
the
failure
to
give
an
instruction,
unless
he
objects
thereto
before
the
jury
retires
to
consider
its
verdict,
stating
distinctly
the
matter
to
which
he
objects
and
the
grounds
of
his
objection.
in
this
case,
petitioner
contends
that
the
respondent's
objection,
utterly
fail,
first
of
all,
to
point
out
to
the
court
what
he
was
objecting
about
specifically
as
required
by
this
rule.
secondly,
they
utterly
fail
to
distinctly
state
to
the
trial
judge
the
grounds
of
his
objection
and
why
he
felt
it
was
error
for
the
trial
court
to
refuse
his
19
requested
instructions.
and
finally,
of
course,
the
objection
was
made
after
the
jury
retires
in
contrary
to
this
rule.
now,
the
issues
in
this
case
as
we
see
it
in
addition
to
a
construction
of
rule
51,
i
might
first
pay
what
the
circuit
court
did
on
appeal
by
the
respondent
from
this
$50,000
judgment.
it
urged
first
in
the
court
on
appeal
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
sustain
the
verdict.
the
court
below
correctly
held,
however,
that
in
the
absence
of
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
it
had
no
power
or
obligation
to
check
the
record
and
find
out
whether
this
was
so
or
not,
but
it
would
not
consider
such
an
assignment
of
their
own
appeal.
the
court
on
appeal,
however,
did
hold
that
15
of
the
requested
instructions,
which
had
been
refused
by
the
trial
court,
were
properly
refused
by
the
trial
court.
but
it
concluded
that
four
of
the
requested
instructions
should
have
been
given
by
the
trial
court
and
accordingly
reversed
the
case.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir
–
no.
pardon
me.
if
your
honor
pleas,
there
were
19
separate
instructions
or
19
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
that
i
think
is
the
general
rule
and
that
would
be
our
position
in
regard
to
that,
your
honor.
the
court
below,
however,
did
remand
the
cause
for
a
new
trial,
setting
aside
the
judgment.
now,
its
petitioner's
position
in
this
case,
first
of
all,
that
the
court
evaded
the
application
of
rule
51
and
its
plain
terms
by
even
considering
the
requested
instructions,
because
the
objection
made
by
the
respondent
was
utterly
insufficient
to
preserve
that
error
on
appeal.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
our
position
is
that
primarily,
as
we
conceive
the
law.
rule
51
is
a
rule
of
substance
that
doesn't
require
--
is
not
just
a
mere
technicality
to
perfect
the
record
on
appeal.
it
is
a
rule
designed
to
advise
the
trial
judge
at
the
last
possible
moment
of
any
error,
which
he
has
committed
immediately
prior
to
the
time
the
jury
retires.
and
that
anything
less
than
that
does
not
fulfill
that
purpose
of
the
rule
and
it's
insufficient.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
my
opinion
of
that
would
be
this.
that
the
mere
“i
object,”
is
merely
a
technical
type
of
objection
such
as
it's
formally
used
as
a
magic
word
to
preserve
a
record
on
appeal.
the
modern
tendency
here
is
to
get
to
the
substance
of
an
objection
and
to
tell
the
court
really
what
you
are
objecting
about
and
why.
now,
secondly,
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
a
matter
of
law,
the
four
requested
instructions
upon
which
the
court
below
reversed
this
case,
were
all
properly
refused
by
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance.
now,
i
don't
intend
to
take
up
the
time
of
the
court
on
that
particular
aspect
to
the
--
to
the
case
other
than
to
point
out
that
one
of
the
instructions
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
without
any
question.
the
other
three
requested
instructions
were
properly
refused
because
the
evidence
didn't
justify
the
giving
of
them.
there
wasn't
evidence
to
support
the
defenses
which
they
propose
to
set
up.
we
brief
that
thoroughly
in
our
brief
and
gave
reference
to
everything
that
we
considered
applicable
in
the
record
bearing
on
each
of
these
instructions,
the
facts.
the
brief
of
the
respondents
suggest
no
new
facts
in
regard
to
any
of
these
requested
instructions
other
than
what
we
had
already
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
chief.
so,
we
refer
the
court
to
that
and
make
the
flat
statement
that
all
of
those
who
were
requested
instructions
were
properly
refused
in
the
first
instance
by
the
trial
court.
the
third
question
that
arises
here
in
this
appeal
is
one
which
has
given
me
some
little
consideration
and
it's
this.
in
a
few
of
the
cases,
the
courts
have
noted
that
there
has
been
an
incomplete
or
imperfect
compliance
with
rule
51
by
the
objecting
party,
but
they
reserve
to
themselves
the
right
on
their
own
motion
to
review
the
refusal
to
give
request
instructions,
even
though
a
proper
objection
is
not
made
under
rule
51.
that
has
happened
in
about
14
cases
but
the
courts
then
turned
around
in
those
cases
and
said
that
such
an
inherent
power
should
only
be
exercised
in
a
very
extra
ordinary
case,
which
they
did
not
find
before
them
at
the
moment.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
to
pick
out
the
thread
where
we
left
out
yesterday,
we
have
here
rule
51
which
provides
that
before
the
jury
retires,
if
the
court
doesn't
give
a
requested
instruction,
you
must
tell
him
that
you're
objecting
to
that
particular
instruction
and
giving
the
basis
of
the
grounds,
thereof.
we
have
here
a
situation
where
the
respondent,
after
the
court
had
refused,
19
requested
instructions,
presented
by
it,
merely
made
this
objection.
i
have
no
exceptions,
except
those
which
are
covered
by
my
requested
instructions
which
were
refused.
now,
incidentally,
the
respondent
in
this
case
has
never
complained
about
the
charge
actually
given
by
the
trial
court
or
has
never
contended
that
it
was
any
wise,
erroneous.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
actually
know.
i'll
say
this
that
the
first
time
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
the
record
does
not
show
when
they
were
submitted.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
they
were
dated
on
the
date
of
--
i
couldn't
say
with
--
i'm
sure
they
were
submitted
before
the
instructions
were
given.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
after
the
evidence
was
in.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
no
sir.
we
never
heard
about
the
instructions
until
the
court
announced
that
they
had
been
requested
he
would
give
three
of
them
at
the
close
of
his
original
charge.
that's
the
first
time
we
ever
heard
about
the
instruction.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes
sir,
except
he
gave
three
out
of
the
22.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
originally,
he
had
refused
all
of
them,
but
on
his
own
motion,
after
giving
his
original
charge,
reconsidered.
and
on
his
own
motion
gave
three
of
them.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
it's
accurate
to
state
that
he
at
least
read
them.
we'll
assume
that's
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
in
order
to
understand
the
problem
presented
here,
which
i
believe
amounts
to
this,
either
rule
51
is
a
rule
of
substantial
law,
and
it
has
a
substantial
meaning,
or
it's
a
mere
technicality.
now,
if
it's
a
mere
technicality,
then,
of
course,
it
would
not
be
a
--
a
matter
of
grave
concern
to
anyone
whether
or
not,
the
court's
applied
rule
51
or
disregarded
it
through
one
guise
or
another.
in
order
to
understand
the
rule,
i'd
like
to
take
the
court
back
and
discuss
its
origin
and
the
cases
of
this
court
bearing
on
the
question.
and
then,
give
our
reasons
as
to
why
we
believe
the
rule
to
be
a
rule
of
substance
and
not
a
mere
technicality.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
don't
quite
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
it's
always
been
the
rule
of
this
court
until
formalized
by
rule
51,
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain.
now
then,
the
first
case,
there
are
only
two
cases
of
this
court
that
bear
directly
on
the
point
here
involved.
in
other
words,
that
are
directly
on
the
point.
the
first
case
is
beaver
versus
taylor
in
93
u.s.
in
that
case,
the
complaining
party
submitted
eight
requested
instructions
of
the
trial
court,
and
the
trial
court
refused
them.
he
made
a
bear
objection
to
the
court's
refusal
to
give
his
eight
requested
instructions,
just
said
he
objected.
he
also
then
accepted
to
the
charge
in
this
manner.
he
accepted
to
the
charge,
to
so
much
of
the
charge
of
the
court
as
given,
as
was
in
conflict
with,
and
variant
from
the
several
propositions
presented
by
him.
on
appeal,
this
court
held
as
it's
already
been
suggested
yesterday
by
mr.
justice
minton
that
the
entire
series
was
presented
as
one
request.
and
if
anyone
proposition
was
unsound,
an
exception
to
a
refusal
to
charge
the
series
cannot
be
maintained.
all
of
the
propositions
presented
were
not
sound,
notably
the
fifth
request
should
not
have
been
complied
with.
in
this
case,
the
instant
case,
the
court
below
held
that
15
of
the
requested
instructions
were
--
were
properly
refused
by
the
trial
court.
in
addition,
this
court
said
in
the
beaver
versus
taylor
case,
one
object
of
an
exception
is
to
call
the
attention
of
the
circuit
judge
to
a
precise
point
as
to
which
it
is
supposed
to
be
at
error.
and
he
may
then
there
consider
it
and
give
a
new
and
different
instruction
to
the
jury
if
in
his
judgment,
it
should
be
proper
to
do
so.
an
exception
on
the
form
we're
considering,
entirely
defeats
that
object.
now,
the
second
case
is
jones
versus
east
tennessee
railway
company,
which
is
a
case
of
157
u.s.cited
in
the
brief.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
request
for
six
instructions
and
the
court
gave
two
of
them
and
denied
the
rest.
and
then
a
bill
of
exceptions,
the
complaining
party,
merely
accepted
the
court's
refusal
to
give
its
requested
instructions
as
in
the
instant
case.
and
this
court,
citing
the
beaver
versus
taylor
case
said,
“this
exception
was
insufficient.”
now,
then,
those
were
the
only
two
cases
dealing
with
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
give
requested
instructions.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
by
this
court
which
had
to
do
with
the
taking
of
exceptions
and
making
objections
to
the
charge
actually
given.
and
to
summarize
what
the
court
has
said
rather
than
go
into
each
of
these
cases,
it
appears
from
a
study
of
the
previous
opinions
of
this
court
enacted
before
rule
51.
i
mean
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
the
last
case,
indirectly
in
point,
we
say
is
jones
versus
east
tennessee
v.&
g.railway
company,
157
u.s.,
682.
in
summary
of
the
position,
that
this
court
has
taken
and
with
respect
to
the
rule
before
its
actual
promulgation
as
rule
51,
it
appears
first.
that
in
situations
where
no
objection
whatever
is
made
to
the
charge
or
to
failure
give
requested
instructions,
it's
held
that
the
complaint
will
not
be
considered
on
appeal.
secondly,
where
there
is
an
objection
made
to
the
charge
given,
or
to
the
court's
failure
to
give
a
requested
charge,
that
likewise,
the
complaint
will
not
be
considered
because
you
haven't
pointed
out
distinctly
to
the
judge
what
the
ground
of
the
complaint
is.
and
finally,
there
is
a
case
of
this
court
that
holds
that
after
the
jury
has
retired
it's
too
late
to
make
any
objection
whatsoever
to
any
and
either
one
of
the
circumstances.
now,
there
is
one
other
case
which
i
will
discuss
at
more
length
later.
i
just
want
to
touch
on
it
at
this
moment
to
say
this.
that's
the
--
the
case
of
atkinson
versus
united
states.
in
that
case,
the
court
--
this
court
held
that
it
had
inherent
power
in
an
extraordinary
case
and
under
unusual
circumstances
to
consider
a
charge
or
requested
charge,
even
though
there
had
been
no
proper
objection
made.
that
is
the
only
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it's
in
my
brief.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
it's
in
297
u.s.,
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
stone.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
was
just
before
the
rule.
now,
there's
only
been
one
case
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
all
right,
sir.
now,
this
rule
51
has
only
been
before
this
court
on
one
occasion,
and
that's
the
case
of
weade
versus
dichmann,
wright
&
pugh,
337
u.s.
in
that
case,
it
was
a
case
where,
at
the
close
of
the
court's
instructions,
counsel
stated,
“we
have
no
exceptions
to
the
court's
charge.”
then
when
the
case
got
up
here
before
this
court,
they
attempted
to
raise
the
question
of
the
correctness
of
the
instructions,
and
this
court
held
that
under
these
circumstances
error
cannot
be
urged
as
to
this
point."
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
no,
this
is
--
this
is
337
u.s.,
your
honor,
weade
versus
dichmann,
wright
&
pugh.
and
that's
the
only
case
where
rule
51
has
actually
been
previously
considered
by
this
court
as
such.
now
then,
as
to
the
reason
for
this
rule,
in
the
first
place,
this
is
a
rule
promulgated
under
order
of
this
court.
it
has
the
force
of
law.
it's
an
important
rule
because
it's
likely
to
have
application
in
every
jury
trial
in
the
district
courts.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
ensure
a
speedy
and
correct
determination
of
all
issues
before
the
trial
court.
and
one
point
which
i
desire
to
stress
very
strongly
is
--is
the
fact
that,
it
is
to
give
the
trial
judge
a
last
minute
check
on
the
correctness
of
his
instructions
and
an
opportunity
to
correct
them
if
they're
wrong.
it's
that
last
minute
feature,
i
think,
that
cannot
be
over
emphasized.
now,
there
is
one
distinction
i
want
to
make
that
i
haven't
seen
in
the
cases.
but
it
occurs
to
me
it's
very
important.
most
of
the
cases
talk
about
the
rule
as
being
whether
the
--
i
mean,
the
--
to
request
instruction
as
to
whether
the
corrected
--
corrected
--
the
requested
instruction
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
law.
oftentimes,
though,
in
cases,
the
requested
instruction,
as
a
matter
of
abstract
law,
is
simplicity
personified
and
can
cause
the
trial
judge
no
difficulty,
whatsoever.
the
real
question
that
would
be
troubling
the
judge,
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
is
not
whether
or
not,
as
an
abstract
point
of
law,
the
instruction
is
legally
correct.
it's
a
question
of,
whether
or
not,
the
evidence
justifies
the
giving
of
the
instruction.
it's
not
enough
to
plead
the
defense
and
have
an
instruction
requested
upon
that
defense.
it's
necessary
for
the
judge
to
determine
that
evidence,
if
believed,
would
bear
out
that
defense.
if
there
is
no
evidence,
the
instruction
must
be
properly
refused.
now
we
submit,
that
in
any
case
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor.
but
what
i'm
pointing
out
is
this.
that
in
the
trial
of
any
lawsuit
in
the
district
courts,
nobody
knows
the
facts
better
than
the
attorneys.
they've
had
a
chance
to
prepare
their
own
case
often
for
months.
by
discovery
procedures,
they
have
an
opportunity
to
ascertain
a
large
amount
of
the
evidence
which
will
be
offered
by
their
opponents
at
the
trial.
as
the
trial
proceeds
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
our
contention.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
we
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
perhaps
that's
correct.
we
--
we
take
the
position
first
that
the
court
evaded
rule
51
by
even
considering.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
in
--
in
this
case,
since
the
lawyer
knows
the
--
the
facts
of
the
case
and
the
evidence
which
is
unfolded
before
his
eager
eyes,
during
the
trial
of
the
case,
he
will
know
more
about
the
facts
and
the
issues
than
the
trial
judge
could
possibly
ever
know.
now,
a
trial
judge,
in
the
trial
of
a
case,
may
overlook
an
--
an
important
or
pertinent
matter
of
evidence.
it
may
slip
his
mind.
and
although
at
the
end
of
the
case,
he
maybe
firmly
convinced
that
he
has
a
firm
grasp
upon
the
evidence,
he
may
actually
have
a
misconception
of
it,
and
what
counsel
should
do.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
what
he
should've
done,
would
have
taken
up
the
--
the
request
that
he
was
sincerely
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
request
which
he
sincerely
thought
should
have
been
given.
and
in
an
earnest
manner,
and
in
a
manner
which
would
leave
the
judge
to
believe
that
he's
serious
about
the
matter
of
requested
of
instructions.
tell
the
judge
--
the
--
the
judge
what
this
request
instruction
is.
and
give
to
him
a
summary
of
the
necessary
evidence,
briefly,
which
he
says
occurred
in
the
trial,
which
would
justify
the
giving
of
that
instruction.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
no.
here's
the
--
here's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
--
to
make.
this
instruction,
most
of
them
were
very
simple
as
far
as
the
matter
of
law
was
concerned.
it
was
a
question
really,
as
to
whether
they
should
--
a
few
of
them
were
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
court
below
so
held.
but
as
to
some
of
these,
the
court
said,
should
have
been
given.
they
were
abstract
questions,
abstract
legal
instructions,
because
the
facts
didn't
justify
the
given.
there
wasn't
any
evidence
there
to
support
the
giving
of
those
instructions.
and
that
--
well,
if
there
had
been
any,
it
was
the
duty
of
counsel
to
go
ahead
and
tell
the
judge.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
at
the
close
of
the
evidence.
i
mean
at
the
close
of
the
judge's
instructions
where
he
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
he
ever
had
any
discussion
at
all.
the
record
is
absolutely
bare
of
any
colloquy
between
the
trial
judge
and
counsel
for
respondent
in
respect
to
the
propriety
of
any
of
the
22
requested
instructions.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well
there
were
22
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
no.
no,
sir.
that
didn't
happen.
what
happened
was,
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
all
we
know
is
that
the
respondent
handed
the
--
a
sheet
of
instructions
to
the
trial
judge.
and
the
court
then
endorsed
refusals
on
them.
whether
there
was
any
explanation
given
to
the
trial
judge,
we
can't
say.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
given
my
opinion.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
three
of
them
did
your
honor.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
as
far
as
it
goes.
but
nevertheless,
when
--
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
giving
these
supposed
defenses,
it
was
up
to
the
court
to
determine
with
the
assistance
of
counsel,
whether
or
not,
the
evidence
justified
the
giving
of
the
defense.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
appreciate
your
honor's
point.
however,
it's
our
position
here
still
that
giving
and
making
the
--
not
a
formal
objection,
but
an
actual
objection
in
substance,
rather
form,
at
the
close
of
the
instruction,
still
has
the
last
minute
effect
of
allowing
the
judge
to
reconsider,
which
is
something
that's
very
important.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
your
honor,
discussing
the
--
whether
or
not
they
should
be
construed
together.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
if
you
mean
merely
saying
i
--
of
--
instead
of
saying
i
object
to
the
failure
to
give
all
of
these
charges,
said
you
numbered
them
said,
the
instruction
number
5,
6
,7,
i
wouldn't
see
any
difference
in
that.
that's
merely
formal
and
technically
adjustment.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
would
say
that's
merely
a
formal
objection
and
not
an
objection
of
substance
as
required
by
rule
51.
i
think
it
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
don't
--
of
course,
the
rules
provide
that
if
the
judge
won't
allow
you
to
make
your
objection,
you
automatically
have
an
exception.
but,
i
don't
--
it's
not
necessary
to
make
an
extended
argument,
just
a
brief
statement.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
it
seems
inescapable
to
me,
however,
that
if
the
question
about
the
instructions
is
not
the
propriety
of
--
of
instructions
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
whether
or
not,
the
facts
justify
them,
but
nevertheless,
counsel
should
be
required
to
state
briefly
to
the
court
what
those
facts
were
that
would
have
justified
the
giving
of
the
instruction.
to
clarify
the
court's
mind,
that
he
may
have
forgotten.
he
may
have
overlooked
something.
he
may
feel
competent,
he
knows
all
about
the
facts,
but
he
may
in
fact
not
know.
and
if
that's
not
at
the
last
possible
minute,
costly
appeals
might
be
avoided.
costly
retrials
as
a
result
of
appeals
might
be
avoided.
and
in
addition
of
that,
the
rule
is
simple.
that
anyone
can
understand
it.
and
it
only
takes
a
few
minutes
to
comply
with
it.
it's
not
an
onerous
test.
and
it's
in
fairness
to
the
trial
judge.
now,
if
the
rule
isn't
applied,
it
will
mean
that
lawyers
can
hand
to
the
judge
a
batch
of
them,
request
the
instructions,
22
in
this
case.
it
might
have
been
44.
make
no
explanation
to
him
except
to
say
these
instructions
are
self-explanatory
on
their
face.
and
then,
if
he
doesn't
give
them,
then
just
sit
back
and
on
appeal,
argue
for
the
first
time
the
propriety
of
giving
those
instructions
when
they
should
have
been
argued
with
propriety
before
the
trial
judge.
now
then,
let's
consider
how
rule
51's
been
--
been
treated
by
the
courts
of
appeal.
there
are
14
cases
that
we've
discovered
where
there
was
no
objection
made
to
the
refusal
of
the
trial
court
to
give
requested
instructions.
and
in
those
--
those
instances,
the
appellate
court
applied
rule
51
and
said,
they
wouldn't
consider,
whether
or
not,
the
instruction
should
or
should
not
have
been
given
in
the
absence
of
a
proper
objection.
in
70
cases,
there
was
no
objection
made
at
all
to
the
court's
charge
actually
given.
and
on
those
cases,
the
courts
below
held
rule
51
applied
and
they
wouldn't
consider
the
propriety
of
the
instructions
actually
given
in
absence
of
a
proper
objection
under
rule
51.
there
are
four
cases
in
which
--
which
are
in
point
with
this
case.
where
a
bare
objection
just
said,
“i
object
to
the
court's
failure
to
give
requested
instructions
occurred,
and
no
grounds
of
the
objection
were
stated.”
and
it
was
held
that
rule
51
precluded
the
consideration
of
that
complaint
or
those
complaints.
and
likewise,
in
24
cases,
where
there
was
just
a
bare
objection
with
the
court's
charge
as
being
erroneous,
but
without
any
grounds
pointing
out
to
the
judge
wherein
the
judge
erred,
it
was
held
that
rule
51
applied.
now,
that's
112
cases.
and
there's
been
a
couple
of
since
then,
in
which
rule
51
has
been
applied.
now,
in
contrast
to
that,
we
have
a
--
a
few
cases.
and
there
are
very
few
where
these
loopholes
had
been
found
in
rule
51.
and
the
rule,
in
effect,
actually
evade.
the
first
is,
one
court
held
that
where
a
charge
is
self-explanatory
on
its
face
that
it
automatically
constituted
the
requested
charge.
and
likewise,
an
automatic
objection
of
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
give
that.
secondly,
it's
been
held
by
some
of
the
courts
that
there's
even
an
erroneous
requested
and
charged.
that
the
court,
if
the
erroneous
charge
is
somewhat
self-explanatory,
that
it,
nevertheless,
constitutes
an
--
an
objection
to
the
charge
actually
given
or
in
itself
requires
the
trial
judge
to
search
around
and
give
a
proper
instruction
upon
the
same
subject.
third,
there's
the
idea
that
rule
46
and
51
should
be
construed
together,
and
that
merely
handing
the
trial
judge
your
written
requested
instructions
makes
known
to
him
the
action
which
you
desire
the
court
to
take.
and
under
rule
46,
automatically
preserves
an
objection
on
appeal,
the
effect
of
which
is
to
utterly
nullify
rule
51.
and
finally,
there
is
the
theory
advanced
by
some
of
the
cases,
that
the
court
on
--
or
the
appellate
courts
have
an
inherent
power
in
an
extraordinary
case
to
consider
the
matter
of
instructions
even
in
the
absence
of
a
proper
objection
under
rule
51.
now
then,
these
points
are
well
exemplified
in
the
two
cases
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
the
instant
case.
they
didn't
discuss
rule
51.
they
merely
denied
the
motion
for
a
--
a
petition
for
rehearing.
and
in
a
footnote,
cited
two
cases
without
comment.
the
first
of
these
was
a
prior
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
itself,
lumbermens
mutual
casualty
company
versus
2603.
now,
in
that
case,
it
appeared
that
the
defendant
made
only
this
objection.
he
said
defendant
accepts
to
the
failure
of
the
court
to
charge
defendants
requested
charge
number
6,
which
is
about
the
same
thing
that
happened
in
the
instant
case.
and
for
charging
numbers
2,
3,
4,
8,
9,
10,
11,
and
14
of
the
plaintiff's
special
requested
charges.
in
other
words,
he
objected
to
the
failure
of
the
court
to
give
his
requested
instruction
and
objected
to
the
court's
charge
as
actually
given.
the
court
first
noted
and
this
appeared
to
be
an
insufficient
objection
under
rule
51.
but
then
it
said
this,
"we
think
in
view
the
full
statement
of
the
defendants
requested
instruction
number
6,
which
had
been
presented
to
the
court
that
these
objections
sufficiently
complied
with
the
requirements
of
rule
51."
in
other
words,
the
requested
instruction,
on
its
face,
was
so
clear
that
the
court
had
constituted
a
requested
instruction
and
an
automatic
objection
for
the
failure
of
the
trial
court
to
give
it.
now
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
the
one
that
i'm
making
now?
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
it
came
up
for
the
first
time
on
rehearing,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
didn't
try
it
here.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
i
helped
my
father
out.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
sir?
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
say,
my
father
tried
the
case
on.
he's
--
had
been
interested
only
on
the
page.
now,
the
court
then,
in
this
(inaudible)
case,
proceeded
to
examine,
defendants
requested
instruction
number
6,
and
then
held
that
it
was
erroneous
and
properly
refused
by
the
trial
court.
as
to
the
objections
to
the
charge
given,
saying
that
two,
three,
four,
eight,
what
not
should've
been
given.
the
court
said,
this
has
--
this
has
absolutely
failed
to
comply
with
rule
51.
and
therefore,
the
objections
to
the
charge
given
will
not
be
considered.
although,
the
fifth
circuit
admitted
that
two
of
those
requests
--
two
of
the
instructions
actually
given
by
the
trial
court
were
erroneous.
so,
i
don't
see
that
this
case
is
much
consolation
to
the
respondent
here.
now,
secondly,
the
court
below
decided
montgomery
versus
virginia
stage
lines,
which
is
a
case
arising
in
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia.
that
was
an
interesting
case.
what
occurred
there
was,
the
plaintiff
woman,
a
passenger
on
an
interstate
bus,
mounted
the
bus
with
heavy
luggage.
she
took
it
back
to
her
sit
and
tried
to
put
it
up
on
the
top
rack
above
her
head
over
the
objections
of
the
driver.
she
rode
along
for
a
while
and
the
thing
finally
fell
off
on
her
head
and
injured
her.
fairly
clear
case
of
contributory
negligence.
there
was
a
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
provided
that
interstate
carriers
have
to
so
stow
baggage
that
it
won't
fall
off
and
hurt
the
passengers.
the
plaintiff
requested
an
instruction
along
that
line,
but
apparently,
it
was
so
inaptly
drawn
that
it
was
erroneous.
the
trial
court
refused
to
give
it.
and
there
was
no
exception
taken
either
to
the
charge
or
to
the
failure
to
give
the
requested
instruction.
on
appeal,
the
case
was
reversed,
the
court
held
first.
yet,
whereas
here,
after
conceding
that
the
requested
instructions
was
erroneous,
yet,
whereas
here,
the
meaning
of
the
request
is
reasonably
apparent,
and
that
subject
matter
is
important
and
not
sufficiently
covered
by
the
general
charge.
a
court
would
not
be
justified
in
ignoring
the
request
merely
because
it's
susceptible
to
such
interpretation
as
to
make
its
proposition
not
absolutely
accurate.
in
other
words,
if
you
give
the
court
an
erroneous
requested
instruction,
it's
up
to
the
trial
court
then
to
figure
out
what
a
proper
instruction
would
be
and
given.
the
court
held
further
that
rule
51
and
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
agree
it's
a
heavier
burden,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
don't
agree
with
the
--
his
--
in
the
reason.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
and
it
is
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
it
takes
us
to
the
question
of
rule
46.
in
this
case,
it
was
held
that
rule
46
and
51
that
should
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
perhaps
that
was
his
--
in
fact
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
--
perhaps
that
was
in
the
back
of
his
mind
generally.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
i
--
i
have
found
that
trial
judges
and
--
and
even
federal
district
judges
are
not
infallible,
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
[laughs]
now,
as
far
as
rule
46
and
51
are
concerned,
the
rationale
of
the
whole
argument
appears
to
be
this.
that
under
rule
46,
which
provides
formal
exceptions
to
rulings
or
orders
of
the
court
are
unnecessary.
where
at
the
time,
the
order,
the
ruling
or
order
of
the
court
is
made
or
sought,
it's
made
known
to
the
court
the
action
which
the
party
desires
the
court
to
take.
in
other
words,
you
can
hand
the
judge
a
--
a
whole
wrap
of
instructions,
and
at
that
point,
you've
done
everything
that's
not
--
that
appears
at
page
12
of
petitioner's
brief,
the
rule
46.
in
other
words,
by
merely
handing
the
trial
judge,
a
requested
instruction
you
make
known
to
him
the
action
you
desire
him
to
take.
it's
not
necessary
for
you
to
make
any
explanation
to
him
whatsoever.
if
he
fails
to
give
it
and
the
instruction
should
have
been
given,
you
have
an
automatic
exception,
although,
you
have
been
of
no
assistance
to
the
trial
court
in
that
connection.
i
can
see
that
at
least
anybody
can
do,
as
far
as
requested
instruction
is
concerned
is
to
hand
them
to
the
trial
judge.
now,
if
that's
sufficient
under
rule
46,
to
preserve
an
objection,
for
the
court's
failure
to
give
that
instruction,
then
rule
51
is
a
nullity.
it's
a
case
of
a
general
rule,
governing
over
a
specific
rule
which
is
contrary
to
all
known
statutory
construction.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
do
you
mean
on
taking
objections?
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
in
the
federal
court?
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
they
take
them
at
length,
your
honor.
they
set
out
--
that
they
--
they
say,
i
object
to
the
certain
subject,
or
certain
instruction.
and
then
you
give
the
grounds
of
it.
and
the
tenth
circuit
is
seeing
right
down
the
line
on
that.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
he
made
what
would
amount
to
just
a
mere
technical
exception.
and
--
in
other
words,
he
expressed
no
more
than
his
displeasure,
at
the
trial
judge's
action,
and
with,
of
course,
avail
through
it,
that
maybe
will
appeal
the
case
and
raise
the
question
on
appeal.
but
it
was
insistence
of
the
trial
judge,
by
pointing
out
why
the
instructions
should
have
been
given.
and
rule
51
does
say
that
you
must
state
the
grounds
of
your
objection.
now
finally,
in
the
montgomery
case,
the
court
suggested
that
it
had
inherent
power
in
an
extraordinary
case
to
review
the
request
--
the
requested
instructions
and
the
instructions
given
on
its
own
motion
in
the
absence
of
a
proper
objection
under
rule
51.
now,
which
of
these
reasons
the
court
employed
to
reverse
the
case
or
whether
it
decided
to
use
them
all
is
not
clear
from
the
opinion.
but,
by
way
of
illustration
of
the
importance
of
rule
51,
i
think
this
case
is
a
good
example
for
this
reason.
i
previously
mentioned
that
there
was
a
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
commission
that
required
public
carriers
to
so
stow
away
baggage
as
not
to
fall
on
passengers.
but
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
that
montgomery
case
admitted,
in
its
opinion,
that
the
matter
of
this
interstate
commerce
regulation
--
commission
regulation
had
never
been
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge.
in
other
words,
as
far
as
we
can
see,
the
only
injustice
suffered
by
anybody
in
that
montgomery
case
was
the
trial
judge
who
was
confronted
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
would
(inaudible)
of
interstate
commerce
commission
about
which
he
probably
was
not
aware.
it's
not
only
a
case
of
the
court
in
that
in
effect
being
charged
with
judicial
notice
of
it,
to
mean,
having
to
take
judicial
notice
of
it.
he
was
charged
with
judicial
notice
of
a
regulation
of
a
quasi-judicial
body.
and
i
dare
say
that
there
--
there
is
no
one
within
the
hearing
of
my
voice
that
could
safely
say
that
they
know
all
these
multifarious
regulations
by
all
of
the
governmental
bodies.
it's
a
perfect
example
of
the
case
where
had
counsel
called
on
the
attention
as
required
by
rule
51
of
the
trial
judge
of
the
fact
that
this
interstate
commerce
regulation,
he
could
have
been
granted
relief.
now
then,
one
final
point.
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
courts
have
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
--
i
suspect
that
that
was
actually
the
truth,
and
they
picked
it
up
and
raised
it
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
in
contrary,
to
the
whole
setup
of
our
judicial
system
where
all
questions
of
law
in
fact
will
be
first
be
tried
in
the
trial
court,
and
not
raised
for
the
first
time
in
an
appellate
court.
now,
as
far
as
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
that
puts
quite
a
burden
on
a
trial
judge.
it's
hard
enough
often
to
decide
whether
a
proper
instruction
should've
been
given,
much
less
an
erroneous
clear
--
clearly
erroneous
one,
than
if
that
should
be
refused,
what
would
be
the
proper
instruction?
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well
as,
justice
--
mr.
justice
cardozo
once
said,
we've
outgrown
primitive
formalism
of
the
law
when
the
word
was
the
sovereign
talisman
and
any
slip
would
fail.
but
that
was
back
in
the
days
where
all
you
had
to
say
was,
“i
object.”
but
rule
51
is
the
modern
theory.
it's
a
rule
of
substance.
it
doesn't
want
anybody
just
to
say,
‘i
object.”
all
it
requires
is
that
if
you
have
an
objection
you
tell
the
judge
what
you're
objecting
about
and
why.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
on
the
other
hand,
to
assume
that
matters
are
incidentally
brought
up
during
the
trial
that
may
or
may
not
put
the
judge
on
notice
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
--
whether
he
actually
was
put
on
notice
is
a
different
question
and,
of
course,
this
rule
is
simple
and
if
it's
strictly
enforced
and
applied,
it's
easy
to
comply
with
and
there
won't
ever
be
any
question
about
it.
but
otherwise,
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
go
back
and
search
the
entire
record
to
see
whether
or
not
colloquies
occurred
between
counsel
in
respect
to
a
certain
point
of
law
as
far
back
as
a
pretrial
conference.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
of
course,
i
might
answer,
your
honor
saying
this,
that
the
court
gave
many
instructions
on
contributory
negligence
and
the
instructions
which
he
actually
gave
here.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
i
think
there
are
contributory
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes.
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
the
court
gave,
in
our
opinion,
proper
instructions
on
contributory
negligence
on
the
acts
of
contributory
negligence
which
were
supported
by
the
issues
and
the
evidence.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
he
didn't
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir,
on
all
the
issues
that
the
evidence
support.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
i
can't
go
over
all
of
them
but
let
me
take
one
case
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
yes,
sir.
for
example,
i'll
give
you
one
example.
there
was
--
there
was
a
request
to
instructions
to
the
effect
of
whether
or
not,
the
plaintiff
on
the
occasion
and
question
failed
to
exercise
ordinary
care
in
attempting
a
landing
with
his
wing
flaps
up.
and
that
such
failure
was
the
approximate
cause
of
the
accident.
and
that
if
you
find
that
your
verdict
should
be
to
the
defendant.
now,
the
court
instructed
the
jury,
that
one
of
the
main
issues
that
will
be
called
upon
to
determine
of
whether
or
not
gibson's
injuries,
resulted
from
negligent
reconditioning
of
the
aircraft
by
lockheed,
or
whether
due
to
poor
or
improper
flying
of
the
plaintiff
at
the
time
of
making
a
landing
in
carswell
field.
he
further
instructed
the
jury
that
it
was
a
contention
of
lockheed
that
gibson's
injuries
were
due
to
the
negligence
of
the
plaintiff
himself,
in
the
manner
of
his
flying,
and
attempted
landing
at
carswell
field.
in
that
he
made
no
effort
to
estimate
the
proper
and
necessary
speed
to
safely
affect
the
landing
in
question.
and
finally,
the
court
told
the
jury,
that
if
it
found
from
the
evidence,
that
the
crash
resulted
from
gibson's
miscalculation
of
his
landing
approach
that
the
plaintiff
couldn't
recover.
so
i
say
it
was
amply
covered
by
the
instructions
in
addition.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
of
course,
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
flaps
had
anything
to
do
with
the
accident.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
on
the
plaintiff,
the
thing
which
we
discussed
these
four
instructions
between
pages
26
to
33
of
our
brief,
and
we
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
erred
in
holding
that
their
appeal's
for
the
trial
courts
to
give
defendants
requested
instructions
and
so
on
and
so
on.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
constituted
a
reversible
error
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
because
they
were
properly
refused
by
the
counsel.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
and
we
set
out
all
the
evidence
and
our
opponents
in
this
case
have
added
nothing
to
what
we've
said
in
these
pages
on
those
particular
instructions.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
because
of
the
confusion
that
if
you
consider
it
since
it's
up
here
because
i
think
it
really
is
an
important
thing,
and
there's
a
quite
of
conflict
in
the
courts
below.
there
are
minority
of
cases
that
--
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
no,
sir.
i'm
just
--
i'd
like
to
emphasize
on
both
the
points,
sir,
if
your
honor,
please.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
if
--
it
doesn't
appear
as
a
matter
of
record,
but
--
so
the
court
will
understand.
these
request
the
instructions,
so
i'm
informed,
i'm
not
--
i
wasn't
there,
were
presented
to
the
trial
judge.
we
never
got
a
copy
of
them,
or
even
know
if
they
have
been
presented,
until
after
the
instructions,
that
the
court
has
been
given.
and
then
he
mentioned
that
he'd
received
the
request
and
would
give
three
of
them.
and
we
still
didn't
get
a
copy
of
it
until
they
filed
the
petition
for
a
writ
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
g.
c.
spillers,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
please.
we
don't
practice
much
in
the
fifth
circuit.
we
do
in
the
tenth
circuit,
but
i
don't
know
what
their
practices
down
there,
apparently
are
not.
we,
therefore,
think
that
--
oh,
further
point
i
want
--
would
like
to
make.
and
that's
one
--
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
court
in
an
exceptional
case
should
have
the
right
to
reverse
a
case
on
its
own
motion.
and
that's
the
case
i
mentioned
before
of
u.s.versus
atkinson
297
u.s.,
which
is
cited
at
page
38
of
our
brief.
and
that's
the
--
that
was
a
case
where
no
exception
was
taken
to
the
charge.
but
then
they
complained
on
appeal
and
judge
--
mr.
justice
stone
held
the
verdict
of
the
jury
will
not
ordinarily
be
set
aside
from
error,
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court.
this
practice
is
founded
upon
considerations
of
fairness
to
the
court
and
to
the
parties,
and
of
the
public
interest
in
bringing
litigation
to
an
end
after
fair
opportunity
has
been
afforded
to
present
all
issues
of
law
and
fact.
then
he
made
this
statement,
and
i
think
this
is
the
best
exposition
of
when
such
an
inherent
power
should
be
exercise
to
give
it
all
and
that's
it.
in
exceptional
circumstances,
especially
in
criminal
cases,
appellate
courts
in
the
public
interest,
may
of
their
own
motion,
notice
errors
to
which
no
exception
has
been
taken.
if
the
errors
are
obvious
or
if
they
otherwise
seriously
affect
the
fairness,
integrity
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
