mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
his
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
involves
the
protection
to
be
accorded
a
known
incompetent
person
so
that
she
may
not
be
deprived
of
her
property,
for
the
failure
to
pay
taxes,
the
amount
of
which
is
but
a
small
portion
of
the
value
of
the
property.
but
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
briefly,
they
are
as
follows.
one,
nora
brainard
was
a
resident
and
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
town
of
somers
which
is
in
westchester
county.
she
had
been
a
resident
there
for
a
number
of
years.
she
lived
in
a
one
family
residence
dwelling
owned
by
herself.
she
was
also
a
person
of
means
in
that
she
owned
property,
income
producing
improved
real
property,
four
other
parcels
in
addition
to
the
house
in
which
she
lived.
she
had
been
and
was
incompetent
for
a
period
of
15
years
prior
to
the
institution
of
the
instant
foreclosure
proceedings.
she
was
known
to
the
citizens,
to
the
neighbors,
to
the
officials
of
the
town
to
be
incompetent,
to
be
incapable
of
handling
her
affairs
and
to
understand
the
nature
of
any
papers,
documents
of
notices
that
may
be
served
upon
her.
with
the
situation
such
as
this,
nora
brainard,
not
having
paid
the
taxes
on
her
own
personal
residence
for
a
period
of
four
years,
the
town
of
somers
invoked
a
comparatively
new
statute
in
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
known
as
the
in
rem
foreclosure
statute
and
listed
her
property
along
with
a
number
of
other
properties
on
a
list
of
delinquent
tax
properties.that
list
was
filed
in
the
county
clerk's
office.
her
name
appeared
as
the
apparent
owner,
the
description
of
the
property
and
the
amount
of
taxes
due.
under
the
in
rem
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york,
that
constituted
in
effect
similar
to
the
filing
of
a
complaint,
also
similar
to
the
filing
of
a
lis
pendens
or
a
notice
of
a
pendency
of
an
action.
then,
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
the
town
attorney
published
notice
of
the
institution
of
the
proceeding
in
two
newspapers.
and
the
notice
in
effect
stated
in
view
of
the
owners
of
the
properties
listed
on
this
delinquent
list
on
file
in
the
county
clerk.
if
you
do
not
redeem
your
property
within
seven
weeks
or
if
at
the
end
of
the
seven
weeks,
you
do
not
put
in
an
answer,
in
effect,
stating
that
you
don't
owe
the
money,
then
your
property
will
be
taken
from
you
and
it
will
be
deeded
to
the
town
of
somers.
publication
was
had.
there
was
no
dispute
in
this
matter
that
publication
was
had.
also,
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
a
notice
was
posted
in
the
proper
public
place
such
as
the
post
office.
also
in
accordance
with
the
statute,
this
notice
was
mailed
to
nora
brainard
at
her
residence.
nora
brainard,
of
course,
did
not
redeem
the
property
within
the
seven
weeks
from
the
date
of
first
publication,
nor
did
she
put
in
an
answer
because
nora
brainard
was
incapable
of
understanding
these
papers
that
had
been
sent
to
her
and
was
so
known
by
the
town
to
be
incapable
of
doing
so.
now,
the
institution
of
these
proceedings
started
sometime
in
may
of
1952.
in
september
of
1952,
the
period
having
expired,
the
seven-week
period
in
addition
to
that,
the
twenty-day
period,
the
town
obtained
a
judgment
from
the
county
court
where
these
proceedings
were
instituted
foreclosing
nora
brainard
of
all
right
title
and
interest
and
into
this
property
upon
which
she
resided.
and
in
accordance
with
the
judgment
to
foreclosure
in
that
case,
which
the
record
of
deeds
was
to
be
delivered
to
the
town,
the
town
had
received
the
deed
to
the
property.
the
town,
then,
on
october
24th,
became
the
absolute
owner
of
this
property.
five
days
later,
in
another
proceeding
to
wit,
on
october
25th,
apparently
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
nora
brainard
was
incompetent
and
of
unsound
mind,
through
all
this
period
of
time,
the
county
court
in
this
other
proceeding
certified
and
adjudicated
nora
brainard
as
a
person
of
unsound
mind.
and
in
that
other
proceeding,
as
a
result
of
that
certification,
one
week
later,
she
was
committed
to
a
state
mental
institution.
that
occurred
on
november
6.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
i
--
i
understand
that
that
is
an
ex
parte
party
proceeding
bases
upon
some
application.
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record
at
all.some
two-and-a-half
months
later,
the
end
of
january,
1953,
mr.
covey,
by
order
of
the
court,
was
appointed
as
committee
of
the
person
and
property
of
nora
brainard.
and
in
the
subsequent
month,
he
qualified
as
the
committee
by
filing
the
necessary
oath
and
bond.
now,
between
february,
1953
and
september,
1953,
about
that
time,
the
property
now
being
in
the
apparent
absolute
ownership
of
the
town,
they
attempted
to
dispose
of
it
and
put
it
up
for
sale
at
a
minimum
upset
price
of
$6500.
on
--
in
september
of
1953,
mr.
covey's
attorney,
the
committee's
attorney,
went
to
the
town
and
said
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
now
tender
to
you
all
of
the
accrued
taxes,
all
the
interest
and
penalties,
all
of
the
charges
of
maintenance,
all
of
your
expenses
in
connection
with
the
foreclosure.
take
it
all
and
give
us
back
the
property.
give
it
to
the
committee
as
the
committee
of
the
person
and
property
of
nora
brainard.
the
town
of
somers
refused.
upon
such
refusal,
the
committee
went
into
the
county
court
where
this
proceeding
had
been
pending,
where
the
judgment
had
been
entered
and
pursuant
to
which
judgment
indeed
had
been
delivered.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
$480
with
all
expenses,
with
all
charges,
interest,
penalties
or
what
have
you.
and
he
went
before
the
county
court
and
made
this
application
to
vacate
the
judgment
and
vacate
the
deed
setting
forth
all
of
these
facts.
no
papers
in
opposition,
that
is
no
affidavits
putting
in
issue
any
of
the
facts
which
i
have
stated,
were
submitted
by
the
town.
in
other
words,
they
took
the
position
that
even
if
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
facts
as
stated
in
the
affidavits
were
taken
to
be
so,
nevertheless,
you
have
no
claim
to
any
remedy.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
precisely,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
there
were
moving
affidavits
submitted
in
connection
with
the
order
to
show
cause
which
was
the
nature
of
the
motion
here.
in
other
words,
this
proceeding
was
brought
on
by
order
to
show
cost
to
set
aside
the
judgment
and
to
set
aside
the
deed.
and
affidavits
were
submitted
not
only
by
the
attorney
for
the
committee
but
also
by
the
committee
himself
setting
forth
the
facts
as
i
have
--
have
stated
them
to
you.
no
affidavit
in
opposition
was
submitted.
merely,
i
assume
a
brief,
a
question
of
law
--
a
question
involved.
the
county
court
denied
the
motion.
the
county
court
--
the
county
judge
said
that,
“we
--
i
think
you
have
chosen
the
wrong
procedure.
that
you
should
not
have
moved
by
order
to
show
cause
or
by
motion
in
the
proceeding,
but
you
should
have
taken
advantage
of
subdivision
7
of
165-h
which
says
that,
a
separate
and
plenary
action
should
be
started
within
two
years.
but
even
if
you
had
done
that,
says
the
opinion
in
effect,
nevertheless,
because
the
town
had
complied
strictly
with
the
letter
of
the
statute,
you
have
nothing
to
complain
about
in
this
matter.
the
committee
then
appealed
from
that
disposition
from
the
order
of
the
county
court
to
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
affirmed
but
not
on
the
opinion
of
the
county
court.
the
appellate
division
said,
“since
the
requirements
of
the
statute
were
followed
by
the
town
verbatim,
notice
by
publication,
by
mailing
and
posting
having
been
complied
with,
regardless
of
the
facts
in
this
matter,
this
seven-week
period
within
which
to
redeem
was
in
effect
the
statute
of
limitations
and
you
have
no
standing
here.”
the
matter
was
then
taken
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
render
any
opinion
so
that
we
do
not
have
the
benefit
of
its
conclusion.
it
merely
affirmed
without
opinion.
however,
on
the
motion
for
reargument
and
for
the
amendment
of
the
remittitur,
it
did
indicate
that
it
did
consider
the
constitutional
question.
in
other
words,
it
did
consider
the
question
whether
nora
brainard
was
deprived
of
her
property
here,
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
without
notice.
in
other
words,
without
due
process,
without
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
united
states.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
precisely.
we
--
we
say
that
it
would
appear
that
the
--
that
the
statute
as
such,
since
it
makes
provision
for
notice,
is
constitutional
per
se.
we
do
say
the
application
by
the
town
of
the
statute
to
the
particular
circumstances
here
were
such
as
to
deprive
nora
brainard
of
her
property
without
notice.
in
other
words,
the
statute
recognizes,
in
effect,
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york,
recognized
that
when
you
deprive
a
person
of
a
valuable
right
such
a
right
--
such
as
a
right
of
redemption,
such
as
a
right
to
excess
funds,
funds'
excess
value,
value
over
and
above
the
value
--
value
over
and
above
the
aggregate
amount
of
the
tax
liens,
those
are
rights
that
may
be
taken
from
a
person
only
upon
notice.
but,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
nora
brainard
was
not
only
incompetent
but
was
known
to
the
town
officials
and
was
known
to
the
citizens
and
was
known
to
the
people
who
had
instituted
this
proceeding
to
be
incapable
and
not
only
incapable
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
notice
that
was
sent
to
her
but
also
incapable
of
protecting
her
rights,
we
say
that
the
application
of
that
statute
unduly
deprives
her
of
her
property.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
no.
by
virtue
of
the
stay
granted
in
the
county
court,
the
--
the
town
was
stayed,
that
stay
was
in
--
extended
by
--
by
the
appellate
division
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
also
extended
the
stay.
by
stipulation
of
counsel
in
this
court,
the
property
is
stayed
from
being
--
in
other
words,
the
town
has
been
stayed
from
disposing
the
property
pending
the
final
disposition
of
the
matter
by
this
tribunal.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
your
honor
--
your
honor
will
find
that
by
a
specific
allegation
at
page
8
of
the
record,
the
first
complete
paragraph
which
reads,
"upon
information
and
belief
that
said,
nora
brainard,
was
incompetent.
although,
not
adjudicated
before
many
years
past
and
was
known
to
the
citizens
of
the
town
of
somers
in
which
she
resided
and
to
the
officials
of
the
town
as
a
person
without
mental
capacity
to
handle
her
affairs
and
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
any
notices
served
personally
upon
her
by
mail
or
by
publication.
and
that
also
appears
a
guide
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
there
was
no
answer
--
there
--
there
was
no
answer
to
that.
there
were
no
affidavits
submitted
in
opposition
to
contradict
that
statement
or
the
statement
contained
on
page
10,
where
the
committee
again
states
at
the
second
line,
“and
upon
investigation,
investigating
the
same,
learned
of
the
mental
capacity
of
the
said,
nora
brainard,
and
very
recently
around
withheld
proceeding
with
the
said
action
knowing
from
my
investigation
that
she
was
a
person
of
unsound
mind
and
unable
to
understand
the
nature
of
act
--
of
her
acts
or
the
nature
of
process
to
be
served
upon
her.
the
committee
apparently
in
another
proceeding,
being
attorney
of
law,
had
--
had
been
called
upon
by
the
northern
westchester
bank
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
upon
another
and
entirely
different
parcel
of
property
upon
which
she
had
not
been
paying
the
amortization
or
the
interest.
what
became
obvious
to
the
private
litigants
in
that
particular
proceeding
was
completely
overlooked,
not
overlooked
but
deliberately
--
deliberately
overlooked
by
the
officials
of
the
town.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
the
answer
lies
in
the
decisions
of
the
court
in
this
particular
proceeding
having
the
decisions
of
the
courts
in
other
proceedings.
i
might
say
first
to
your
honor.
subdivision
7,
firstly,
does
not
provide
nor
anywhere
in
the
act
does
it
provide
that
a
separate
plenary
proceeding
is
the
exclusive
remedy
of
one
who
claims
that
there
was
a
lack
of
process.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
i'm
not
asking
your
honors
to
say
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
very
well,
then
i
shall
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
the
state
--
the
state
courts
have
held
uniformly
contrary
to
the
statement
contained
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
that
the
motion
is
available.
and
i
have
cited
two
cases
in
the
reply
brief
the
matter
of
wilfred,
stefanski
against
the
city
of
new
york.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
sir,
i
can
merely
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
i
--
i
can
only
trace
for
you
what
happened
in
these
proceedings
along
with
the
nelson
case,
the
wilfred
case,
stefanski
case.
and
it
will
take
more
than
about
three
--
three
minutes.
what
happened
here
was
after
the
county
courts,
the
county
judge
had
rendered
his
opinion
where
in
the
suggestion
was
made,
you
got
the
wrong
procedure
but
even
if
you
have
the
right
procedure
you
have
no
remedy.
that
opinion
was
published.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
the
county
court
so
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
no.
he
--
he
so
stated
it
in
his
opinion.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
when
(inaudible)
said
that
--
that
notice
have
been
given
in
effect
he
states
that
the
notice
having
been
given
we
can
do
nothing
for
you.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
no,
but,
in
affect
have
--
if
--
if
we
were
to
start
another
proceeding
then
they
would
flash
the
opinion
of
the
county
court
in
front
of
the
next
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
yes,
because
subdivision
7
would
say,
“you
start
a
plenary
or
separate
action
and
the
county
court
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
matter.”
but
after
the
--
after
county
courts
had
rendered
that
decision,
the
nelson
case
was
started.
in
other
words,
by
virtue
of
--
by
virtue
of
the
so-called
mandate
of
this
particular
county
of
judge
where
in
he
had
suggested,
you
must
start
a
separate
plenary
proceeding,
the
nelson
case
came
before
the
courts
so
there
the
taxpayer
had
also,
because
of
the
deportation
of
a
bookkeeper
lost
property
worth
$50,000
or
$60,000
by
virtue
of
not
having
paid
some
water
taxes
amounting
to,
perhaps,
about
$84.
they
started
a
separate
and
plenary
action.
and
the
appellate
division,
the
same
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
which
passed
upon
this
case
said,
“you
don't
start
a
plenary
or
separate
action
at
all.
go
make
your
motion
in
the
original
proceeding.”
now,
it
has
been
stated
by
the
appellee,
the
town
of
somers,
well
of
necessity
that
had
to
be
the
ruling
because
in
the
administrative
code,
which
was
similar
to
our
own
state
in
rem
tax
statute,
subdivision
7
or
the
provisions
of
subdivision
7
were
not
applicable
at
that
time.
assuming
that
that
was
not
so,
nevertheless,
that
maybe
it
lay
after
the
decision
in
the
nelson
case
by
the
appellate
division,
the
administrative
code
was
amended
stating
under
subdivision
7,
“now
you
may
also
start
a
separate
and
plenary
action.”
but,
then
they
went
ahead
and
made
a
motion.
in
the
original
foreclosure
action
and
in
the
original
foreclosure
action,
that
motion
was
denied.
it
went
to
the
appellate
division.
there
was
no
suggestion
anymore
that
a
separate
or
plenary
action
has
to
be
completed.
they
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
rendered
a
per
curiam
opinion
and
they
said,
“the
heart
--
the
--
the
results
may
be
harsh.
they
may
be
almost
unrealistic
and
rather
difficult
to
take.
but
in
the
nature
of
things,
this
is
like
a
statute
of
limitations.
and
we
can
do
nothing
for
you
in
the
nelson
case.
of
course,
the
facts
are
slightly
different
there.
there
wasn't
this
question
of
notice
we
have
in
this
particular
instance.
there
the
taxpayers
were
competent
in
every
respect.
there
the
taxpayers
were
capable
of
protecting
themselves.
but
after
the
nelson
case,
there
haven't
been
any
decisions
at
all.
our
research
has
shown
no
case
in
the
courts
of
new
york
which
says
that
taxpayers
will
be
relegated
to
a
separate
and
plenary
action.
but
to
the
contrary,
directly
on
this
state
in
rem
statute,
an
application
was
brought
in
the
very
same
foreclosure
action.
the
motion
was
made,
the
motion
was
entertained,
the
motion
was
granted
in
the
case
in
the
matter
of
wilfred.
and
there,
the
court
did
not
follow
the
decision
of
the
county
court
in
this
particular
case.
and
then
still
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
excuse
me.
and
still
again,
under
the
administrative
code
now
that
we
have
subdivision
7
of
the
administrative
code
as
recently
as
the
next
case
which
is
the
city
of
new
york
against
stefansky
case,
a
motion
again
was
--
was
made
within
the
action.
in
other
words,
the
suggestion
of
a
separate
and
plenary
action
of
the
--
of
the
county
court
has
not
been
followed
not
only
this
in
case
by
the
courts
but
has
not
been
followed
by
the
courts
in
the
only
other
two
cases
which
are
reported
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
then
aside
from
that,
here
we
contend
a
lack
of
process.
here
we
contend
that
jurisdiction
was
lacking
within
the
court.
and
because
jurisdiction
was
lacking,
because
it
had
not
acquired
jurisdiction
over
this
particular
person,
notice
not
having
been
given
to
her
always
in
a
situation
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction,
the
judgment
may
be
attacked
not
only
collaterally
by
a
separate
or
plenary
action
but
directly
in
the
action
and
so
it
had
been
held
time
and
time
again
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
think
it's
an
accepted
decision
of
holding
of
all
of
the
courts
except
from
the
state
of
louisiana.
in
other
words
where
process
lacks,
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction
acquired
by
reason
of
lack
of
notice,
that
then
it
may
be
attacked
not
only
collaterally
but
also
directly
(voice

mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
well
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
i
would
say
to
your
honor
that
under
your
decision
in
the
mullane
case
because
there
was
a
lack
of
process,
because
jurisdiction
was
lacking
in
its
entirety
that
this
person
being
a
known
incompetent,
in
other
words,
since
the
town
knew
that
she
was
incompetent
on
the
mullane
case
there
was
a
failure
of
--
of
jurisdiction
and
we
would
then
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
that
has
been
the
contention
of
the
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
(voice
overlap)
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
when
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
precisely.
in
other
words
--
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
well,
the
court
of
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
consider
subdivision
7
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
subdivision
7
battered
up
and
back
received
no
consideration,
we
believe,
from
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
if
they
had
--
if
they
had
rendered
an
opinion
in
this
matter
we
would
have
the
benefit
of
their
thinking.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
yes.
now,
the
appellate
division
which
decided
this
case
about
two-and-a-half
months
after
the
nelson
case,
is
presumed
to
know
what
it
had
said
in
the
nelson
case
and
it
would
have
disregarded
subdivision
7
in
its
entirety
we
may
assume
for
the
purposes
of
our
argument
that
subdivision
7
was
not
deemed
to
be
an
exclusive
remedy.
now
under
--
nowhere
in
the
statute,
and
we
have
read
the
statute
carefully,
is
there
any
statement
that
subdivision
7
shall
be
your
exclusive
remedy.
and
with
respect
to
that,
subdivision
7
starts
with
a
negative
so
that
we
do
not
have
the
specific
statement
that
your
remedy
lies
by
a
separate
or
plenary
action.
in
this
particular
instance
we
go
further.
we
find
that
the
state
of
new
york,
through
its
attorney
general,
is
allowing
himself,
allowing
himself
with
the
town
of
somers,
although,
we
make
no
claim
to
the
statute
per
se
being
unconstitutional.
the
attorney
general
now
takes
the
position
that
you
have
not
proved
that
nora
brainard
was
incompetent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
seeks
to
create
an
issue
of
fact
as
to
the
incompetency
of
nora
brainard
and
it
also
seeks
to
create
an
issue
of
fact
with
respect
to
the
known
incompetency
of
nora
brainard.
we
say
under
this
record
this
does
not.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
we
--
we
say
that
the
town
of
somers
then
should
have
provided
what
the
common
law
has
also
provided
for
the
appointment
of
a
special
guardian.
in
other
words,
that
a
special
guardian
should
have
been
appointed
from
that
point
on
not
only
to
receive
notice
of
the
proceeding
but
also
to
protect
her
rights
in
this
matter.
and
that
is
our
position
before
this
court.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
well,
in
the
nature
of
a
guardian
ad
litem
or
a
special
guardian.
in
new
york
it
is
known
as
a
special
guardian.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
yes,
the
question
had
been
raised
there
whether
the
court,
in
other
words,
the
--
now
that
the
matter
was
in
the
supreme
court
that
the
supreme
court
being
a
court
of
original
jurisdiction
and
being
in
effect
be
similar
to
the
court
of
chancery
in
england
could,
by
virtue
of
the
conscience
within
its
jurisdiction,
now
exercise
the
equitable
powers
and
grant
relief.
but
that,
of
course,
by
virtue
of
four-to-one
decision,
the
equitable
powers
they
thought
nonexistent
or
not
for
them
to
exercise
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
that
was
one
of
the
--
yes,
that
was
one
of
the
contentions
we
raised
but
unfortunately
the
four
other
justices
did
not
agree
with
us.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
but
the
two
years
at
that
time
had
not
expired.
in
other
words,
under
this
opinion
as
well
as
the
opinion
of
the
county
court,
we
had
nothing
to
offer
to
the
court
if
we
started
a
separate
and
plenary
action.
that
was
the
point
raised.
and
under
the
subdivision
7,
we
could
do
nothing
because
there
the
county
--
there
the
town
would
come
in
and
say,
“we
comply
to
the
letter
of
the
law.
with
the
letter
of
the
law
the
notice
was
given
and
you
have
no
remedy.”
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
sprafkin
we
were
denied
that
as
i
said
to
your
honor
but
we
may
raise
the
point
that
there
is
no
exclusivity
with
respect
to
the
separate
and
plenary
action
fairly
advances
by
the
appellee
in
this
case.
