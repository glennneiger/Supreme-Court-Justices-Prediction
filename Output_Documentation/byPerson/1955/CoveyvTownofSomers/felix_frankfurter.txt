justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
answer
to
this
--
to
this
claim
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
in
his
amicus
brief
that
the
difficulty
was
not
the
condition
of
the
complainant
but
that
the
committee
having
had
one
way
of
getting
relief
from
the
temporary
condemnation
in
the
loss
of
the
property,
it
didn't
pursue
that
way.
and
new
york
has
the
right
to
say,
“you
should
go
by
getting
your
relief
this
way
and
not
some
other
way.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
that
--
suppose
you
read
about
that.
is
it
for
us
to
say
that
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
can't
say
that
i've
availing
--
get
yourself
that
remedy
is
the
difficulty
of
this
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
don't
know
what
it
said.
it
simply
says
that
it's
affirmed
what
was
done
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
i
can
find
a
state
ground
supporting
that,
i
must
find
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
dose
that
mean
--
does
that
mean
i
have
to
study
new
york
law
in
the
decision
new
york
(inaudible)
which
is
the
controlling
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe,
it
maybe
one
has
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
still
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
than
--
than
what
the
local
law
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
--
i
will
say
per
curiam
just
cited
article
vii-a.
let's
suppose
it
had
done
that.
would
you
then
have
standing
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
to
say
that
new
york
can
say
that
although
the
--
the
initial
proceeding
was
wanting
in
due
process,
the
way
to
seek
the
refuge
of
that
is
--
is
something
what
that
article
vii-a
does,
do
you
account
on
that?
in
other
words
due
process
can
correct
an
initial
denial
of
due
process
and
if
new
york
chooses
to
have
some
other
remedy,
then
disregarding
the
original
transaction,
the
original
proceeding
isn't
that
within
its
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
what
it
so
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
they're
just
cited,
article
vii-a
of
the
(inaudible)
brief.
i
shouldn't
think
we
could
go
behind
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
that.
contrary
to
the
question
means
it
doesn't
exist
because
of
the
state
grants
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
so
how
do
you
know?
how
did
anybody
know
the
(inaudible)
that
we
have
an
opinion
from
a
judge
in
new
york
who
says
there
is
that
remedy.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
having
judges
on
it
and
presumably
aren't
blind
to
the
--
the
next
corporation
to
disregard
the
kind
of
things
that
your
record
discloses.
i
should
think
on
the
whole
i
would
presume
that
people
on
that
court
of
appeals
aren't
as
flawless
and
it's
for
you
to
get
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
probably
where
the
trouble
is
and
to
fix
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
you
this?
back
to
our
consideration
that
what
has
been
gathered
from
your
--
of
your
statement
to
the
appellate
division
here?
the
deciding
judge
there
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
excellent
procedure
believes
that
it
didn't
have.
there's
no
suggestion
by
him
that
this
is
mandatory
and
the
summary
on
page
16
of
the
record,
they
seem
to
indicate
that
difficulties
arise
from
statute
of
limitation
which
by
reason
of
which
a
remedy
open
to
the
committee
wasn't
availed
of.
so
that
in
that
court
certainly
these
other
state
procedure
to
consider
a
--
a
remedy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
appellate
division
to
work
on
a
sponsor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
get
to
it
concerned
the
certain
judge
need
suggestion
that
although
the
statute
of
limitations
by
direct
relief,
equity
was
equal
to
giving
relief
from
that
situation
because
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
to
suggest
couldn't
be
as
evident
to
the
appellate
division
thought
that
the
--
that
the
remedies
available
by
new
york
law
was
allowed
to
go
by
default
by
reason
of
a
factual
decision
on
the
part
of
the
committee
to
pursue
the
remedy.
and
if
that's
so,
then
certainly
there's
no
denial
of
pretrial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
attorney
general
suggest
is
that
in
that
proceeding,
you
could
have
set
forth
what
you're
claiming,
namely,
the
condition
of
owner
are
incompetent.
the
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
officials
at
that
time
that
she
wasn't
competent
their
failure
to
take
the
steps
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
get
out
of
the
opinion
of
the
appellant
--
of
this
memorandum
or
whatever
you
call
it
in
the
appellate
division.
and
again,
what
was
(inaudible)
this,
namely,
they
could
and
get
relief
from
the
sense
of
security.
now,
whether
actually
he
should
can
of
that
should
or
shouldn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
pleadings
on
than
these
affidavits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
wouldn't
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
what
--
what
kind
of
play
in
this
case,
the
references
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case
could
have
been
made
within
the
two-year
period
in
addition
to
the
four
years
in
(inaudible)
what
kind
of
claim
in
the
facts
--
under
the
facts
of
this
case
which
she
had
pressed
within
the
two-year
period,
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
this
case,
let's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
speculate
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
this
case,
would
the
fact
that
judge
(inaudible)
thought
--
presented
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
case
for
equitable
relief,
would
that
have
been
available
in
the
plenary
proof
or
this
would
give
(voice

--
justice
felix

pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
then
he
claims
he
had
two
more
years
in
which
to
do
something.
it's
pointless
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
there
might
--
there
might
be
--
justice
felix

--
a
premise
whether
they'll
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore
you
have
turned
--
therefore
--
now,
you
could
say
there
was
a
remedy
when
there
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that's
the
importance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
satisfied
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
at
no
time
could
she
have
shown
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
the
--
during
any
part
of
that
period
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

period
--
justice
felix
frankfurter

to
foreclosure.
could
she
have
any
legal
representative
who
could
have
made
that
choice,
that
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
i'm
--
you
confuse
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
the
two-year
period
is
the
two-year
period
we've
been
talking
about
for
the
last
ten
--
five
minutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
i
understood
you
to
say
with
--
the
candor
required
of
counsel,
one,
to
save
--
not
having
to
protect
his
client.
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
--
speaking
as
a
lawyer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
thought
that
that
issue
she
couldn't
have
contested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
you
can't
contest
with
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can't
contest
it.
that's
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wanted
to
know
--
my
question
to
you
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
question
was,
was
there
anytime
before
the
foreclosure
because
according
to
your
view
there
was
no
time
thereafter.
was
there
any
hearing,
anytime
when
she
had
legal
representative
who
could
have
raised
this
question
of
knowledge
by
the
town
of
her
incompetence
and
therefore
unfair
and
they
can
call
it
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
at
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now,
will
you
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
you
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
please
state
what
that
means
assuming
we
accept
your
statement
that
--
i
mean,
we
accept
your
statement
without
(inaudible)
that
the
affirmance
can
be
--
is
attributable
to
use,
the
third
ground
that
was
urged.
now,
what
does
that
mean
with
reference
to
the
due
process
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
spell
that
out
if
you
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now,
you
speak
of
course
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
but
in
addition
to
the
weight
of
that
properly
carried,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
ruling
in
a
new
york
court
that
you
could
vouch
with
that
--
that
statement
of
law,
namely,
that
the
proceeding
under
section
7
155-h
ruled
over
the
question
whether
the
foreclosure
was
made
in
the
place
of
an
incompetent,
knows
to
be
an
incompetent,
whereabouts
known
are
they
(inaudible)
is
there
any
--
have
you
got
any
reference
wherein
a
new
york
case
would
support
your
statement
in
so
reading
that
remedy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
to
do
what
was
done
by
the
town
people
under
the
claim
here
made
that
they
foreclosed
--
for
tax
the
imposed
on
a
piece
of
property
which
must
broaden
the
taxes
with
knowledge
that
the
property
was
owned
by
an
incompetent,
with
knowledge
of
the
whereabouts
concerning
it,
that
to
do
so
would
imply
one
a
due
process
and
therefore
the
legislation
must
be
read
otherwise.
is
that
what
you're
arguing
that
it
must
--
but
it
must
be
implied
from
the
relief
that
such
yourself
could
give
that
that
issue
would
be
over
(voice

--
justice

that's
what
you're
arguing?
