mr.
otto
e.
koegel
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
heard
it
said
many
times
that
hard
cases
make
bad
law,
it
might
make
bad
law
and
i
hasten
therefore
to
make
this
as
least
hard
as
my
powers
will
avail.
there
is
more
than
a
fake
suggestion
here
that
there
has
been
callous
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
appellee
municipality
toward
the
plight
of
the
incompetent
whose
affairs
are
now
in
the
hands
of
a
committee.
in
new
york,
we
say
committee.
if
i
mispronounced
that
word,
it's
because
of
my
earlier
education
in
washington
where
they
call
it
committee,
i
believe
still.
i
would
like
to
dispel
emphatically
any
such
notion
and
as
quickly
as
i
can.
i'll
take
just
a
minute
to
plea.
i'd
like
to
discuss,
sir,
but
very
briefly
the
municipality
and
its
geography.
somers
is
a
township
called
"towns
of
new
york
state,"
organized
in
1788.
it
comprises
approximately
26,000
acres
and
some
points
are
eight
miles
distance
--
distant
from
others.
it
is
not
a
homogenous
community.
a
considerable
portion
of
its
population
is
to
be
found
in
so-called
somer
developments,
housing
families
from
new
york
city.
generally,
they
are
adjacent
to
lakes,
privately
owned
by
the
property
owners
associations.
one
of
several
in
the
community
is
lake
purdy,
where
the
property
of
nora
brainard,
the
incompetent
here,
is
situated.
another
is
lake
shenorock,
where
mr.
king
lives,
five
miles
distant.
i
have
a
country
home
in
hamlet
called
granite
springs,
seven
miles
distant
from
lake
purdy.
another
community
is
lake
lincolndale
in
the
north-central
portion
of
the
town.
south
somers
is
seven
miles
distant
from
lake
purdy's
and
that
is
where
mr.
chambers
lived.
the
town
is
bisected
with
lakes
belonging
to
the
water
supply
of
new
york
city.
it
takes
more
than
the
equivalent
time
per
mile
to
get
from
place
to
place
as
it
would
say
in
arizona
or
california.
the
town
house
or
seat
of
government
is
two
miles
from
lake
purdy
in
a
building
known
as
the
elephant
hotel,
built
by
bailey
of
circus
fame
to
commemorate
an
elephant
he
brought
into
this
country.
none
of
the
elected
officials
from
the
town
of
somers
come
from
lake
purdy.
the
first
attorney
for
the
town
in
this
litigation,
mr.
stanley
anderson,
has
never
lived
in
the
town.
at
the
time
of
his
employment,
he
lived
at
katonah
in
the
town
of
bedford
adjoining,
which
was
the
home
and
place
where
he
died
of
--
the
first
chief
justice
of
this
great
court.
also
living
in
katonah
in
another
township
is
mr.
covey,
the
committee.
he
is
a
lawyer
too
of
this
incompetent.
as
i
have
said
there
is
no
elected
official,
public
official
in
the
somers
government
from
lake
purdy.
now,
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
somers
official
then
do
not
know
people
in
lake
purdy,
they
most
certainly
do.
but
everybody's
--
everyone's
business
is
not
every
other
person's
business
in
a
far
flung
township
as
would
be
the
case
in
a
small
more
closely
confined
rural
town.
appellant
states
at
the
outset
in
his
brief
that
the
facts
are
undisputed.
he
is
more
or
less
justified
in
that
because
we
have
not
come
to
grips
with
it
and
i
should
much
prefer
to
see
this
case
decided
on
the
applicable
principles
of
law
rather
than
upon
a
narrow
factual
issue
which
he
says
doesn't
exist.
he
says
the
facts
are
undisputed
because
no
affidavits
were
submitted
and
no
proof
produced
controverting
statements
made
by
the
appellant,
mr.
covey,
the
committee
of
nora
brainard
and
the
affidavit
of
the
counselor
mr.
king.
these
were
moving
affidavits
in
support
of
an
application
for
--
in
order
to
show
cause
and
a
stay
addressed
to
the
county
court,
county
court
under
the
foreclosure
in
rem
statute
being
the
court
vested
with
jurisdiction
over
those
foreclosures
except
in
new
york
county
where
there
is
no
county
court
and
in
which
case
it
is
the
supreme
court
of
the
state.
i
will
demonstrate
i
hope
that
there
was
a
completely
improper
procedure.
the
correct
one
being
the
filing
of
a
plenary
action
to
set
aside
the
judgment
of
foreclosure
together
with
the
filing
of
a
lis
pendens
which
the
statute
specifically
refers
to
and
makes
--
required
in
the
county
clerk's
office,
that
was
not
done
either.
now,
if
i
may
take
up
very
hurriedly
these
affidavits
and
i'll
accept
them
at
their
face
value.
we'll
see
how
much
value
they
have
on
their
face.
the
king
affidavit,
from
investigation
made
by
me
and
from
conversations
have
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i'm
so
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
this
mark
too.
the
king
affidavit
is
on
page
--
what
is
it,
9?
4
and
5
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
--
of
the
transcript
of
record.
from
investigation
made
by
me
and
from
conversations
had
--
had
with
the
duly
elected
officials
in
the
town
of
somers,
not
merely
any
of
them
or
the
purport
or
substance
of
the
conversation,
much
less
detailed
and
narrative,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
said
nora
brainard
was
and
has
been
incompetent
for
more
than
15
years.
if
that
isn't
conclusory,
i
--
i
don't
know
what
is.
i
had
been
advised
that
more
than
two
years
ago
efforts
were
made
by
one
of
the
justices
of
the
peace
of
the
town
of
somers.
i'm
not
saying
which
one
or
what
advice
he
got
to
have
her
committed
to
grasslands
hospital,
a
state
hospital
for
mental
defectives,
by
reason
of
her
mental
condition.
i've
been
further
advised
that
on
many
occasions,
the
state
police
were
called
to
abate
the
nuisances
committed
by
the
said
nora
brainard.
it
would
have
been
helpful
if
some
slight
specification
were
had
in
that
respect.
in
the
king
affidavit,
this
is
also
recited
that
mr.
king
is
the
attorney
for
harry
b.
brainard
which
he
goes
on
to
--
whom
he
goes
on
to
describe
also
as
the
husband
and
sole
surviving
heir
at
law
of
the
said
nora
brainard.
now,
the
living
could
have
an
heir
at
law
but
that's
what
he
says,
the
said
harry
brainard
being
a
non-resident
of
the
state
of
new
york.
so,
she
was
living
alone
by
the
very
necessary
implication
--
conclusion
of
this
affidavit.
now,
the
affidavit
of
mr.
covey,
the
committee
on
the
subject
of
the
competency
of
nora
brainard
and
with
respect
to
an
answer
to
--
previous
to
her
commitment
says
only
the
following,
"upon
information
and
belief,
the
said
nora
brainard
was
incompetent,
although
not
adjudged
for
many
years
passed
and
was
known
to
the
citizens
of
the
town
of
somers
in
which
she
resided
and
to
the
officials
of
the
town
as
a
person
without
mental
capacity
to
handle
her
affairs
and
unable
to
--
and
understand
the
meaning
of
the
notices
served
personally
upon
her
by
mail
or
by
publication."
now,
even
allowing
face
value,
as
i
indicated
i
would
to
this
--
as
evident,
i
submitted,
does
not
amount
too
much.
it
is
true
that
it
was
not
denied
in
answering
affidavit
for
the
reason
that
no
answering
affidavit
was
required.
an
oral
return
was
made
by
the
first
counsel
in
this
series
that
appeared
here
for
the
town.
i'm
number
three.
he
made
his
conveyance,
sir,
and
a
country
real
estate
lawyer.
he
made
an
oral
submission
--
appearance
to
return
on
the
return
date
in
white
plains
of
this
order
to
show
cause.
he
submitted
a
brief
memorandum
of
law
after
the
manner
in
which
i
would
consider
a
common
law
lawyer
would
say
a
demurrer
ore
tenus
to
the
order.
the
county
court,
enable
judge
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
sir?
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
the
memorandum
of
law?
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
no,
i
said
what
a
common
law
--
he
appeared
orally
i
say
and
what
a
common
lawyer
would
say
would
be
tantamount
to
a
demurrer
ore
tenus,
where
you
appear
orally
and
object
to
the
legal
sufficiency
or
inadequacy
of
the
pleading
or
whatever
the
demurrer
is
in
oppose
to.
the
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
he
did
not
have
to
file
an
answering
affidavit.
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not
and
he
did
not.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
no
and
he
did
not.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
no
motion
of
any
kind.
all
he
had
to
do
is
to
make
a
return
which
he
did.
he
made
the
return
in
person
and
filed
a
memorandum
of
law.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
on
the
return
day,
you
do
whatever
the
order
to
show
cause
directs
you
to
do.
return
with
whatever
documents
you
are
suppose
to
hand
up.
whatever
explanation
you
are
to
make
or
to
do
whatever
you
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
not
necessarily,
no.
it's
--
the
show
cause
explained
why
you
have
done
so
and
so.
you
don't
have
to
explain
it
in
advance.
you
can
show
up
on
the
return
day
and
if
you
can
satisfy
the
court
that
your
explanation
is
a
good
one.
that
is
a
return.
whether
that
--
whether
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
--
i
am
completely
right
or
completely
wrong
about
that
that
is
what
happened.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
and
i
state
this
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i'm
sorry.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
no,
there
were
--
no,
your
honor.
if
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
the
--
the
answer
to
that
is
we
just
ignored
them.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
no
pleadings
other
than
these
affidavits
whatever.
that
is
correct.
and
the
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that's
my
view
that
none
is
necessary.
i
think
it's
beside
the
point
in
this
case
nothing
was
filed
in
any
case
in
the
town
--
municipality,
it
is
not
to
be
stopped
by
the
negligence
of
its
officialdom.
they
did
the
best
they
could
and
they
did
what
thought
--
they
thought
wouldn't
be
improper.
i
happened
to
think
it
was
not
improper.
i
would
have
done
it.
i
would
have
filed
the
affidavits
strongly
resenting
if
i
felt
so
disposed
to
do,
the
implications
of
this
hearsay
and
broad
conclusory
sworn
status
but
none
--
no
--
no
issue
whatever
was
tendered
on
those
statements
in
writing,
none
whatever.
i
think
the
brief
of
the
appellant
stretches
things
a
little
too
far,
when
on
page
5
it
suggests
that
the
town
attorney,
that
was
mr.
anderson.
he
was
the
counsel
for
the
town.
the
town
doesn't
have
an
official
called
town
attorney.
the
new
york
state
law
provides
for
one
but
that
town
has
not.
as
the
counsel
for
the
town
especially
engaged
in
this
foreclosure
work,
they
begin,
mr.
--
the
town
attorney
who
applied
for
the
order
appointing
mr.
covey
special
guardian
under
the
soldiers
and
sailors
relief
act.
they
say,
"why
didn't
he,
since
he
was
so
mindful
of
that,
suggest
that
he
should
do
something
with
respect
to
one
who
he
knew
to
be
incompetent?"
well,
there's
no
real
proof
that
he
knew
anyone
to
be
incompetent.
all
he
had
before
him
was
the
--
were
the
two
affidavits
with
the
conclusory
averments.
the
soldiers
and
sailors
relief
act
provides
that
to
the
extent
of
any
adverse
effect
upon
anyone
in
the
armed
forces
and
that
even
goes
into
the
--
carries
into
the
foreclosure
in
rem
statute
of
new
york.
a
safeguard
must
be
had
and
that
is
a
special
guardian
must
be
appointed
to
inquire
whether
any
armed
forces
personnel
would
be
affected
by
any
of
these
indicated
names
in
the
foreclosure
proceedings.
nora
brainard's
name
was
one
of
the
defendant's
name,
perforce
the
--
mr.
covey,
the
same
man
later
appointed
committee
here,
appointed
their
special
guardian.
he
came
up
with
the
obvious
answer,
the
correct
one
that
no
soldier
or
sailor
or
marine
had
an
interest
affected
and
therefore
he
stipulated
by
order
that
there
were
no
such
--
the
implications
of
that
act
and
the
foreclosure
was
allowed
to
proceed
on
its
way.
but
they
suggest
from
this
legal
factual
record
here
that
the
town
attorney,
that's
mr.
anderson,
that
he
was
lax,
having
been
so
alert
on
that
soldiers
and
sailors
relief
act
not
to
have
seen
to
it
that
this
woman,
obviously,
incompetent
should
have
had
a
committee
appointed
for
her.
i
say
that
that
is
hardly
fair
to
deduce
such
an
obligation
on
him
from
the
meagerness
of
this
testimony
but
i
--
i
don't
want
this
case
to
rest
on
that
at
all.
the
only
reason
i
have
advanced
this
is
because
it
was
suggested,
i
think,
by
mr.
justice
burton
that
just
what
is
the
extent
of
the
evidence
here,
from
just
what
do
they
draw
the
conclusions
that
the
town
knew.
because
if
the
town
did
know
that
becomes
certainly,
in
my
book,
immoral
consideration
that
a
proper
government
should
take
account
of.
and
i
have
not
prepared
on
the
basis
of
this
record
to
conceive
that
this
town
did
something
that
was
patently
immoral.
now,
then
i'm
going
to
use
some
of
my
time
with
the
court's
permission,
i
believe
the
clerk
has
already
suggested
to
the
court
that
permission
would
be
asked
to
let
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
to
have
some
of
my
time.
i
would
like
to
have
him
have
10
minutes
of
my
time
and
i
will
use
only
of
the
balance.
how
many
minutes
have
i
--
about
12?
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
not
particularly,
the
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i
appeal
that
i
have
--
i
have
at
least
--
maybe
i
haven't
--
maybe
i
haven't,
maybe
i
over
--
maybe
i
over
spoke.
what
i
--
what
i
meant
to
say
and
what
i
--
perhaps
would
have
been
more
correct
in
saying
was
that
i
hope
to
point
out
that
it
wasn't
patently
clear
here
that
the
town
had
been
cruelly
negligent
and
had
been,
beyond
any
doubt,
guilty
of
--
of
complete
lack
of
interest
in
this
unfortunate
taxpayer.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that
why
i
said
and
counsel,
i'm
sure,
inadvertently
failed
to
state
because
his
brief
goes
on
hurriedly
to
state
that
the
town
immediately
cut
that
figure
in
half.
i'm
not
saying
that's
enough
either
but
the
town
did
cut
that
$6500
figure
down
to
$3500,
am
i
not
right?
now,
they
--
they
admit
that.
so,
it
was
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
let's
say
35,
yes.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
it's
still
a
good
many
times
$400
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
--
are
granted
--
granted--granted.
but
we
--
we
are
faced
here
with
more
than
what
seems
to
be
the
proper
arithmetic
to
apply,
town
vis-a-vis
taxpayer
in
arrears.
we
are
faced
here
so
it
seems
to
me
with
whether
we
have
a
statute
that
is
simple,
workable,
has
built
into
a
due
process
and
whether
or
not
we
have
denied
due
process
to
the
taxpayer
incompetent
in
this
case.
and
i'd
like
to
take
just
one
or
two
minutes
to
demonstrate
to
my
satisfaction
at
any
rate
that
we
have
not.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i
think
she
had
a
remedy.
i
think
she
had
a
remedy
during
the
two
years.
this
is
her
title
as
counsel
on
the
other
side
has
pointed
out.
the
title
that
--
as
had
in
the
first
instance
in
this
165
--
section
165
proceeding
is
a
presumptive
title
only
and
for
two
years
thereafter,
it
takes
four
years
of
tax
arrears
in
the
first
place
to
bring
about
one
of
these
titles,
four
years
and
seven
weeks.
and
then
after
that
it's
--
it
is
presumptive
for
two
years
only
and
during
that
two
years,
they
have
a
right
to
litigate
whatever
relevant
facts
and
circumstances
there
--
there
are
that
would
tend
to
title
them
to
relief.
i
don't
think
they
were
entitled
any
relief
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
they
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
pay
the
tax?
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
no
--
no,
they
don't
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
pay
the
tax.
they
have
the
right
to
come
in
and
say
an
error
was
made
that
they
got
the
wrong
property
and
that
has
happened.
that
the
property
was
mistakenly
over
assessed,
being
mixed
up
with
another
property
or
something
like
that.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that
is
right.
as
it
may
it
seem
harsh
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i
think
that's
the
end
of
it.
that
may
be
summum
jus
but
i
think
we
have
some
of
that
in
the
law
whether
we
like
it
or
not,
statute
of
limitations
inherently
have
those
things
built
in
them
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
well,
if
she
had
brought
a
plenary
action
to
set
this
aside
on
the
ground
of
mistake
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
well,
i
can't
think
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
well,
you
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
there
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
off
hand,
i
can't
think
of
any.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
off
hand,
i
can
think
of
none.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
well,
it
might
be
pointless
in
this
case.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that's
right.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
but
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
well,
it
might
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that
would.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
at
all
together
sure
that
had
they
brought
a
plenary
action
here
and
justiciated
this
alleged
competency
that
they
might
not
have
found
another
answer
to
it.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
it
is.
it
may
have
been.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
well,
i
have
to
be
perfectly
candid
about
it,
i
doubt
it.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i've
got
a
client
here.
i
don't
want
to
concede
something
i
shouldn't.
i
doubt
it.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i
am
so
satisfied
with
that.
there
isn't
any
doubt
whatever
in
my
mind,
yes.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
to
think
she
couldn't
have
foreshown
known
incompetency
on
the
part
of
the
town
officialdom,
to
an
--
a
degree
of
proof
that
would
satisfy
a
tribunal.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
oh,
she
could
have
shown
it
there
of
no
time
anterior
to
the
foreclosure,
effective
in
this,
of
the
foreclosure.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that's
my
view.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that's
my
answer.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
she
--
yes.
that's
--
i'm
awfully
glad
you
asked
that.
i'm
going
to
yield
to
my
esteemed
friend,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
new
york,
he'll
have
no
time.
the
--
she
had
a
committee
appointed
and
serving
during
most
of
this
two-year
period
and
all
he
did
was
litigate
the
effect
of
the
denial
by
the
county
court
of
this
motion
which
county
court
had
pointed
out
to
him,
"you
are
on
the
wrong
track.
get
on
the
right
one."
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i'm
sorry.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
yes,
we
are.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
she
couldn't
have
successfully
contested.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
that's
right.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
she
wouldn't
be
any
farther
alarmed
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
--
than
she
is
now.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i
am.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
i
think
i
understand
your
question.
my
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
no.
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
may
i
yield
--
mr.
otto
e.
koegel
