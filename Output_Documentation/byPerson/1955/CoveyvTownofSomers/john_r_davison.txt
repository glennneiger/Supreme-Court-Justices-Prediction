mr.
john
r.
davison
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
new
york
is
here
on
defense
of
its
tax
statute.
now,
desired
judgment
in
reading
the
opinions
in
this
case
that
the
courts
of
new
york
have
determined
that
the
appellant
could
not
challenge
the
regularity
of
this
foreclosure
proceeding
by
a
motion
in
the
action,
in
the
in
rem
action,
but
have
to
bring
a
separate
action
which
is
specifically
provided
for
by
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
john
r.
davison
pardon
me?
mr.
john
r.
davison
your
honor,
there
is
no
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
an
official
opinion
of
the
court
itself.
however,
there
is
a
memorandum
of
affirmance
which
is
prepared
by
the
state
reporter
which
is
reported
in
308
new
york
798.
that
memorandum
of
--
of
affirmance,
while
drawn
by
the
reporter,
is
so
drawn
as
to
suggest
the
counsel
the
basis
of
the
court's
--
the
determination
in
that
action.
and
if
you
will
examine
that,
i
think
you
will
be
convinced
that
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case
was
the
third
ground
raised
by
the
respondent
in
the
court
of
appeals.
specifically,
that
the
--
the
deed
delivered
pursuant
to
a
judgment
in
an
in
rem
proceeding
may
only
be
set
aside
in
the
manner
provided
by
a
statute,
namely,
by
an
action
to
set
aside
the
deed
and
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
pendency
thereof
in
the
office
of
the
county
clerk.
mr.
john
r.
davison
yes,
your
honor.
it's
308
new
york
798.
mr.
john
r.
davison
oh,
i
would
add
just
one
thought.
i
am
not
saying
anything
out
of
school
when
i
say
this,
but
those
memorandum
of
affirmance
are
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals
before
they
are
appended.
mr.
john
r.
davison
the
memorandum
of
affirmance
is
not
quoted
in
my
brief,
your
honor,
but
it
is
officially
reported
in
308
new
york
at
page
798
and
it's
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
john
r.
davison
so
far
as
i
am
concerned,
that
statute
provides
the
due
process
and
the
due
process
was
not
followed
here.
mr.
john
r.
davison
the
--
yes.
the
statute
provides
that
a
separate
action
could
be
brought.
mr.
john
r.
davison
yes.
the
--
this
statute
is
quoted
in
my
brief.
mr.
john
r.
davison
at
page
6.
i
have
in
fact
quoted
the
entire
statute
but
the
relevant
portions
are
quoted
in
the
paragraph
before
the
statement.
mr.
john
r.
davison
"the
--
the
giving
of
the
deed,
avowing
the
judgement
of
foreclosure,
constitutes
presumptive
evidence
under
the
statute
that
all
action
and
proceedings
therein
almost
required
by
law
have
been
complied
with."
then
the
statute
goes
on,
"the
--
after
two
dear
years
from
the
date
of
record
of
the
deed,
the
presumption
becomes
conclusive
and
then
it
provides
no
action
to
set
aside
such
deed
may
be
maintained
unless
the
action
is
commenced
and
the
notice
of
pendency
of
the
action
is
filed
in
the
office
of
the
proper
county
clerk."
now
--
mr.
john
r.
davison
i
submit
--
mr.
john
r.
davison
that's
--
that's
right
and
that
is
--
mr.
john
r.
davison
--
the
specific
--
mr.
john
r.
davison
i
--
i
say
that
under
the
decision
of
the
county
court
here,
under
the
memorandum
of
affirmance,
as
you
will
see
it
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
this
court
has
decided
--
that
court
has
decided
in
this
case
that
the
only
method
of
proceeding
is
by
a
separate
action
under
this
subdivision
7.
mr.
john
r.
davison
i
--
i
submit
that
she
--
if
she
came
in
by
a
separate
action
and
prove
that
at
the
time
the
foreclosure
proceeding
was
brought,
the
officials
who
were
bringing
the
proceeding
knew
that
she
was
incompetent
and
thus
prove
that
dereliction
and
duty
on
their
part
that
she
could
get
all
the
relief
she's
seeking
here.
mr.
john
r.
davison
i
have
no
new
york
case,
but
as
i
read
your
decision
and
i
believe
it
was
the
ballard
case
which
is
--
is
cited
--
or
cited
in
our
brief.
in
order
to
have
due
process,
you
cannot
have
a
dereliction
of
duty
or
the
running
out
of
a
statute
of
limitations
or
as
was
here
by
virtue
of
some
fraud
on
the
part
of
a
public
official,
that
wouldn't
be
due
process
of
law.
and
as
i
--
i
have
no
case.
mr.
john
r.
davison
that
--
yes,
sir,
exactly.
mr.
john
r.
davison
exactly.
thank
you.
