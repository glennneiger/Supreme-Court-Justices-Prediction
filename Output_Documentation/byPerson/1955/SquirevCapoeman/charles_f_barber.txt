mr.
charles
f.
barber
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
is
an
income
tax
case.
the
question
is
whether
certain
indians
are
liable
for
income
taxes
on
certain
income.
taxpayers
here
are
full-blooded
quinaielt
indians,
husband
and
wife.
they
belong
to
a
group
of
indians
who
have
become
respected
members
of
the
west
coast
communities
in
which
they
live.
the
relations
between
these
indians
in
the
united
states
stem
from
a
treaty
entered
into,
between
the
united
states
and
these
indians,
in
1955
and
1956.
pursuant
to
that
treaty,
some
200,000
acres
of
the
olympic
peninsula,
along
the
pacific
coast
in
the
far
northwest,
were
set
aside
for
their
exclusive
use.
this
area
contains
a
stand
of
virgin
timber,
largely
citrus
spruce
but
with
the
important
quantities
of
douglas
fir,
hemlock,
and
other
commercial
timbers.
the
income
of
these
indians,
considered
as
a
group,
is
derived
principally
from
the
sale
of
timber
and
from
salmon
fishing.
they
derive
about
an
equal
amount
from
each
source.
in
1907,
a
plot
of
land
on
this
reservation
was
allotted
to
the
taxpayer
husband.
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
general
allotment
act
of
1887,
as
required
by
the
general
allotment
act,
the
patent
issue
to
taxpayer
husband,
provided
that
the
land,
the
fee
to
the
land,
would
be
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
for
his
exclusive
use
and
benefit
for
a
period
of
25
years
at
the
end
of
which
the
fee
would
be
conveyed
and
this
language
is
important
in
this
suit,
discharged
of
said
trust
and
free
from
all
charge
and
encumbrance,
whatsoever.
the
25-year
trust
period
has,
since
been
extended
by
a
statute
and
the
title
to
the
land
continues
in
the
united
states.
taxpayers'
allotment
contained
a
typical
stand
of
timber
that
is
typical
for
this
reservation.
a
1910
amendment
to
the
general
allotment
act
provided
for
the
sale
of
such
timber
at
the
request
of
the
indian
allottee,
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
in
1943,
the
timber
from
taxpayers'
allotment
was
sold
pursuant
to
the
statutory
authorization.
and
some
$8500
was
paid
into
his
account
subject
to
withdrawal
by
taxpayer
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
during
that
year,
some
$1500
was
paid
over
to
the
indian
taxpayer
for
his
use.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
proceeds
of
this
sale
of
timber,
from
taxpayers'
allotment
are
subject
to
the
requirements
of
the
federal
income
tax
laws.
after
a
test
case,
brought
in
the
tax
court,
by
another
quinaielt
indian,
similarly
situated,
had
resulted
in
a
determination
that
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
timber
was
taxable.
respondents
filed
a
return
and
paid
the
tax
about
$300,
calculating
their
liability
as
provided,
or
as
was
their
option,
i
should
say,
under
the
income
tax
laws
on
the
basis
of
long-term
capital
gain.
after
a
timely
claim
for
refund
was
filed
and
denied,
this
suit
was
brought
in
the
--
in
the
district
court
for
the
return
of
taxes
allegedly,
unlawfully
collected.
we
come
then
to
the
question
of
law
involved
in
this
case.
the
case
arises
under
the
income
tax
laws
which
comprehensively
tax
every
individual
on
gains
and
profits
and
income
from
every
source,
whatever.
as
recently
as
last
term,
in
the
glenshaw
glass
case,
this
court
had
occasion
to
note
that
in
these
provisions,
congress
had
exerted
the
full
measure
of
its
taxing
power.
indians
are
within
the
scope
of
these
provisions
as
respondent
recognizes.
they
are
not
exempted
from
tax
as
indians
or
as
wards
of
the
government
by
any
provision
in
the
income
tax
laws.
taxpayers
based
their
argument
here
for
exemption
wholly
on
the
undertaking
by
the
united
states.
in
their
trust
patent,
given
to
them
pursuant
to
the
general
allotment
act
to
deliver
the
fee
to
this
land
to
them
at
the
end
of
the
trust
period
free
of
all
charge
and
encumbrance,
whatever.
they
argue
that
these
provisions
confer
on
income
derived
from
the
land
an
exemption
from
tax
and
give
their
contentions
a
constitutional
twist
by
arguing
that
they
have
a
vested
right
in
tax
exemption
given
to
them
under
a
1907
patent
which
could
not
be
taken
away
by
a
1913
income
tax.
they
further
argue
that
the
collection
of
the
tax
in
this
case
constitutes
an
invasion
of
this
specific
trust
assumed
by
the
united
states.
i'll
approach
this
question
in
two
steps.
first,
i'll
review
the
sweep
of
this
court's
decisions
declaring
subject
to
tax
income
of
indians
in
various
situations.
second,
i
will
address
myself
more
specifically
to
the
arguments
which
are
made
upon
this
provision
in
the
trust
patent,
the
argument
that
is
wherein
respondents
get
out
of
this
obligation
to
deliver
the
fee
an
exemption
from
tax.
addressing
myself
to
the
first
question,
the
--
the
broad
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
income
tax
laws
to
indians,
i
perhaps
control
most
light
on
this
question
if
i
review
the
history
of
this
problem
in
capsular
form.
indians
being
subject
to
tax
as
an
--
as
citizens
of
the
united
states,
there
are
being
no
exemption
from
tax
in
the
income
tax
laws,
the
question
would
be
simplicity
itself.
but
for
the
pervasive
ramifications
of
a
series
of
attorney
generals'
opinions
in
the
mid
20s
which
found
their
way
into
some
court
of
appeals
decisions
in
the
early
30s.
now,
i
would
like
to
put
those
into
perspective.
i'll
start
in
1913
with
the
imposition
of
the
income
tax
or
the
enactment
of
the
income
tax.
the
early
rulings
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
showed
that
from
the
outset,
the
commissioner
asserted
that
the
income
of
indians,
without
distinction
as
to
whether
from
allotted
lands
or
other
sources,
was
subject
to
tax.
i
believe
i
am
correct
in
saying
that
without
significant
departure
at
any
time
since
the
enactment
of
the
income
tax,
the
commissioner's
position
has
been
the
same.
and
that
is
this,
that
the
income
of
indians,
whether
restricted
or
not,
whether
or
not
from
restricted
lands,
is
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
income
tax
laws.
the
--
i
say
without
significant
departure
because
such
departures
have
--
have
occurred,
have
been
in
specific
cases,
where
in
accordance
with
lower
court
decisions,
the
commissioner,
of
course,
was
required
as
to
the
tax
hears
in
question
to
abide
by
the
results
of
those
decisions.
i
mentioned
in
stating
the
consistency
of
the
commissioner's
position
that
the
difficulties
that
have
come
into
this
question
arose
from
certain
attorney
general's
decisions.
these
were
decisions
of
attorney
general
sargent
in
1924
and
1925.
the
basis
of
the
decisions
was
that
indians
as
wards
of
the
government
should
be
considered
to
be
exempt
from
tax.
it
was
consist
--
it
was
inconsistent,
inconceivable,
the
attorney
general
thought
that
congress,
who,
through
history,
had
taken
a
position
of
protecting
these
indians
as
wards
of
the
government
would,
at
the
same
time,
intend
to
exact
a
part
of
such
income
as
they
received
in
income
taxes.
the
treasury
at
the
time
rejected
this
basis
of
the
attorney
general's
opinion.
the
treasury
acquiesced
only
insofar
as
certain
indians,
under
certain
treaty,
not
involved
in
the
case
of
the
quinaielt,
had
written
into
the
treaties
specific
tax
exemptions
in
so
many
words.
a
land
was
given
and
it
shall
be
tax
exempt
for
25
years,
or
in
a
case
with
another
group
of
indians
for
three
years,
and
thereafter,
shall
be
taxable.
in
1931,
a
case
came
before
this
court
called
choteau
versus
burnet
in
283,
united
states.
there,
this
court,
in
clear
terms,
rejected
what
had
been
the
basis
of
this
attorney
general's
opinions.
it
referred
to
the
pervasive
application
of
the
income
tax
laws.
that
case
concerned
oil
royalties
from
restricted
lands
paid
to
a
competent
indian.competent
indian
is
something
that
has
meaning
in
the
oklahoma
setting
in
which
it
arose,
whereas
to
those
indians,
certificates
of
competence
were
issued
which
carried
with
them
certain
rights
over
the
disposal
of
their
property.
the
court
noted
that
this
indian
had
full
use
of
this
money,
it
refused
to
--
or
read
into
the
restrictions
on
the
land
from
which
it's
from
any
exemption
from
tax
and
held
these
payments
taxable.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
not.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
differences
are
several.
the
type
of
--
let
me
talk
about
the
significant
differences
first.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
the
choteau
case
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
the
choteau
case,
the
royalties,
i
believe,
were
from
tribal
lands.
they
were
collected
and
paid
into
the
trust
upon
setup
over
those
funds.
they
were
then
paid
out.
some
of
them
were
paid
those
indians
who
had
certificates
of
competency
received
their
--
their
royalties
outright
without
restriction
as
to
their
use.
other
indians
who
have
not
such
certificates,
or
who
were
minors,
or
who
were
incompetent
in
the
usual
sense
of
mentally
incompetence
and
under
guardianship
did
not
receive
their
royalties.
the
arguments
advanced
in
the
case
were
that
the
indians
were
exempt
--
this
indian
was
exempt
qua
indian
or
he
was
exempt
because
the
royalties
were
derived
from
restricted
lands,
and
a
tax
exemption
should
be
implied
from
the
--
from
the
restriction.
both
of
those
arguments
were
rejected.
in
our
case
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
this,
i
think,
you
could
not
generalize
further
than
to
say
it
was
applicable
to
--
or
say
it's
indians
who
had
their
certificates
of
competency
and
receive
the
royalties
outright.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
i
have
been
astounded
in
getting
into
this
problem
that
every
group
of
indians
seems
to
have
a
somewhat
specific
set
of
treaties
and
statutes
which
have
some
bearing
on
the
problem
in
the
light
of
the
precedence.
my
earlier
statement
of
the
generality
of
the
commissioner's
position
cuts
through
all
of
those
distinctions
and
focuses
only
on
those
treaties,
and
there
are
a
number
of
them
under
which,
the
indians
have
a
homestead
or
so
many
acres
which
is
"exempt
from
tax
for
the
period
stated
in
the
treaty‚Äù.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes
by
--
to
know
what
ordinary
income
is,
it
was
income
from
the
land,
part
of
it,
of
course,
included
a
wasting
of
the
asset,
the
tax
laws
will
recognize
that
waste
by
allowing
depletion
so
that
only
the
gain
is
taxed
that
is
--
the
return
of
capital
is
taken
out
of
the
income.
and
the
--
the
tax
is
placed
on
the
balance.
i
should
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes,
that
is
ordinary
method.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
not.
in
this
case,
the
(inaudible)
timber.
timber
like
oil
or
virgin
timber
as
we
have
here,
once
you
take
it
away,
the
return
is
way
off
in
the
future.
oil,
when
you
take
it
out
of
the
land,
is
gone
for
good.
but
in
either
case,
for
same
--
the
same
reasons,
congress
has
allowed
a
--
a
depletion
allowance
to
recognize
the
element
of
return
of
capital
in
the
proceeds
of
the
product
of
the
land.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
in
the
case
of
timber,
under
the
laws
as
they
were
applicable
in
1943
and
today,
the
owner
of
the
land
has
an
option.
he
may
either
treat
his
sale
of
the
timber
as
a
long-term
capital
gain
as
these
taxpayers
did.
in
that
case,
he
deducts
from
the
proceeds,
such
portion
of
the
cost
or
value
in
1913
of
the
property
as
it
represents
the
timber.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
right.
he
may
also
treat
the
return
as
depletable
income.
that
is
an
option
which
as
respondents
have
pointed
out
is
more
particularly
applicable
where
you'll
have
a
large
lumber
companies
which
are
operating
a
large
track
taking
out
income
over
a
long
period
of
years.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
a
very
--
it
is
a
more
complicated
provision,
it
is
not
straight
percentage
depletion,
but
it
is
founded
on
the
same
principles.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
would
rather
not
use
competence
in
his
sense.
he
has
not
obtained
the
fee
to
his
land.
in
the
case
of
the
quinaielts,
the
determination
of
whether
they're
competent
or
they're
not,
turns
upon
whether
they
have
applied
for
and
received
the
fee.
if
they
have
received
the
fee,
they're
termed
competent,
if
they
have
not
received,
they're
termed
incompetent.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
very
definitely,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
this
court
has
usually
characterized
the
relationship
as
out
of
guardian
and
ward.
it
has
minor
technical
differences
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
we
have
to
find
somewhere
an
exemption
from
tax.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i'm
not
sure
i
get
the
question
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
--
i'm
kind
of
focusing.
i
just
watch
what
--
what
is
in
your
mind.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
the
case
of
a
guardian
and
ward
you
do
not
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
distinguish
the
taxable
estate
of
the
ward
from
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
the
--
the
title
and
supervision
which
is
held
by
the
guardian.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
the
guardian
is
also
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i
think
it
might
be
more
helpful
to
regard
it
as
congress
in
either
case.
congress
is
the
guardian
of
the
indians.
congress
is
also
the
body
who
says
who
shall
pay
taxes.
now,
we
--
our
ultimate
question
is
did
congress
intend
to
tax
these
people.
we
have
two
sources
to
look
to.
one,
we
look
to
the
general
allotment
act
and
the
implications
which
are
build
upon
that.
on
the
other
hand,
we
looked
at
the
broader
terms
of
the
income
tax.
i
suggest
that
it
doesn't
really
help
the
question
to
look
on
it
--
upon
it
as
though
the
trustee
were
some
third
person
entirely
independent
of
the
taxing
power.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
that's
--
that's
to
--
to
--
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes
and
of
course
the
authorization
in
this
case
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
the
authorization
in
this
case
comes
from
congress
and
the
action
of
the
department
of
interior
qua
guardian
is
governed
by
act
of
congress.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
there
is
--
there
is
one
general
statement
that
i
make
with
some
caution
knowing
how
complex
it
is,
but
we
have
made
a
careful
study
of
the
rulings
of
the
commissioner
and
that
is
the
one
fact
which
has
been
regarded
as
conferring
tax
exemption
is
the
land
shall
be
"nontaxable"
or
‚Äúshall
be
exempt
from
tax‚Äù.
those
words
are
found
in
certain
treaties
and
arrangements
with
the
indians
both
before
and
after
the
imposition
of
the
income
tax.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
the
problem
is
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
administrative
record.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
a
certain
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i'd
rather
say
that
that
effect
has
been
given
to
this
language
as
an
administrative
matter.
it
has
never
been
considered
by
this
court
whether
it
should
be
read
as
a
tax
exemption
as
against
the
federal
income
tax.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
find
in
--
i
didn't
hear
you,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
yes.
there
are
quite
a
number
of
them.
they're
collected
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
is
both
ways,
your
honor.
some
of
the
provisions
in
the
case
of
oklahoma
indians
say
that
the
allotted
land
shall
be
exempt
from
tax
for
a
period
of
25
years,
and
thereafter,
so
shall
be
subject
to
all
state
and
federal
taxes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
some
say
three
years,
some
say
until
1931.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
we
say
references
to
the
state,
references
to
the
specific
authorizations.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
would
have
to
be
made,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
one
of
the
earliest
cases
under
the
general
allotment
act
is
the
united
states
versus
rickert
in
188
united
states.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well
that
--
that
--
before
taxation
of
an
individual
indian
comes
--
of
course,
you
have
the
taxation
of
reservation
land
as
well.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
oh,
well
that
has
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
has
been
the
rule
that
has
been
changed
by
statute
in
the
oklahoma
case
where
such
a
large
amount
of
the
wealth
of
the
state
was
in
the
hand
of
the
indians.
by
statute,
i
should
say,
with
the
consent
of
the
indians,
they
worked
out
a
trail
with
the
state
which
was
acceptable
all
around.
to
get
back
to
what
underlies
the
doctrine
to
which
you
refer,
we
go
back
to
a
1902
decision
in
this
rickert
case
where
the
state
asserted
the
power
to
tax
certain
indians
who
tail
lands
much
like
those
in
issue
here.
and
the
court
held
that
they
were
not
subject
to
state
taxation.
it
was
an
ad
valorem
real
estate
tax.
they
referred
to
or
relied
to
some
extent
on
the
doctrine
that
instrumentalities
of
the
federal
government
are
not
subject
to
taxes.
they
relied
further
on
general
considerations
that
if
this
tax
could
be
enforced
against
the
land
and
the
indian
had
no
other
income,
the
land
could
be
destroyed
defeating
the
long
range
policy
of
the
congress
in
maintaining
the
indian
aspect.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
correct,
sir.
that
has
been
observed
by
this
court
in
--
in
number
of
decisions
including
these
recent
oklahoma
tax
commission
cases.
there
are
different
--
different
problems
are
involved
where
there
are
different
sovereignties.
this
goes
back
to
mr.
justice
minton's
question,
because
here,
you
have
congress
looking
after
both
policies
and
striking
a
balance
between
them.
i
might
say
just
a
word
about
this
problem
which
has
been
adverted
to
in
our
exchange,
that
is
the
fact
that
these
indians
do
not
own
the
fee
of
the
land,
or
in
oklahoma
terminology,
these
indians
are
incompetent.
the
--
that
question
was
litigated
in
this
court
in
1935,
in
superintendent
on
five
civilized
tribes
versus
the
commissioner.
that
case
concerned
income
on
income.
that
is
income
from
investment
of
oil
royalties.
the
income
as
here
was
paid
into
the
account
of
the
indian,
subject
to
withdrawal
by
the
indian
with
the
consent
of
the
secretary.
it
was
argued
that
because
those
lands
were
--
because
those
monies
were
restricted
and
were
not
available
for
the
free
disposition
of
the
indian
that
they
should
not
be
taxed.
but
the
court
rejected
that
suggestion
and
held
these
restricted
monies
and
taxes.
for
our
purposes,
a
dictum
in
that
case
may
be
even
more
important.
the
petitioner
there
relied
on
a
holding
in
an
earlier
tenth
circuit
case
involving
one
mary
blackbird.
in
that
case,
the
tenth
circuit
had
held
that
income
from
restricted
lands
is
not
taxable,
in
the
hands
of
a
restricted
indian.
that
is
our
case.
this
court
reviewed
the
reasoning
of
that
case
and
said
that
the
court
correctly
failed
to
follow
its
earlier
pronouncement
because
it
was
inconsistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
the
choteau
case
five
years
earlier.
following
this
decision,
we
find
an
attorney
general's
ruling
withdrawing
from
his
earlier
wardship
equals
tax
exemption
concept
and
declaring
that
income
of
restricted
indians
generally
is
subject
to
tax.
in
1938,
we
find
the
department
of
interior
informing
in
a
--
official
miscellaneous
circular
addressed
to
all
superintendents
informing
them
that
indians,
just
like
other
citizens,
should
file
returns
and
pay
taxes.
the
income
tax
laws
had
several
times
been
reenacted
since
this
--
this
time
and
we
find
no
expressions
of
dissatisfaction
with
this
policy.
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
that
the
general
principle
that
indians
must
play
taxes
like
other
citizens
is
very
firmly
established.
now,
i
come
to
the
second
part
of
my
argument,
what
i
call
the
second
part,
and
examine
the
arguments
which
are
made
by
respondent
in
an
attempt
to
build
a
tax
exemption
out
of
this
language
in
the
general
allotment
act.
it
may
be
helpful
to
look
at
the
language.
the
statute
is
at
page
41
of
our
brief.
in
section
5,
down
about
--
just
before
the
provided
in
italics,
you
find
the
words
that
at
the
expiration
of
the
trust
period,
the
united
states
will
convey
the
same
to
the
indian,
discharge
the
said
profits
and
free
of
all
charge
or
encumbrance,
whatsoever.
this
statute
was
amended
in
1906.
you
will
find
the
amending
act
on
the
next
page.
the
language
i
will
look
at
is
on
page
43.
the
original
act
had
provided
for
a
trust
to
be
held
for
25
years.
the
amending
act
provided
for
the
conveyance
of
the
land
in
fee
to
an
indian
found
to
be
able
to
manage
his
affairs.
and
the
language
which
respondents
focus
on
is
found
toward
the
end
of
section
6.
and
it
says
when
the
land
is
conveyed,
a
patent
shall
be
issued
in
fee
simple
and
thereafter,
all
restrictions,
as
to
sale
incumbent
or
taxation,
shall
be
removed
and
said
lands
shall
not
be
liable
to
the
satisfaction
of
any
debt.
this
reference
to
removal
of
restrictions
of
taxation,
we
submit
is
an
obvious
reference
to
the
exemption
which
had
been
found
by
this
court
as
to
state
taxes
and
that
no
more
should
be
read
into
it
than
that.
of
course,
this
was
some
years
before
the
1913
income
tax
had
been
enacted.
so
we
are
left
with
the
provision
on
the
general
allotment
act.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well
we're
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
we're
searching
for
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
and
so
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
no,
we
are
--
we
look
at
that
language
in
the
light
of
the
context
in
which
it
was
enacted
and
considered
against
other
manifestations
of
the
congressional
intent.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
you
have
the
problem
of
resolving
a
--
a
--
two
competing
general
policies.
one,
to
set
the
indians
apart
and
protect
them,
on
the
other
hand,
to
have
a
general
income
tax
applicable
to
all
citizens
alike.
you
must
consider
this
in
the
context
of
those
two
policies.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
of
course
your
honor,
those
two
policies
were
--
were
not
the
first
time.
we're
arguing
the
effect
of
those
two
competing
policies.
in
the
choteau
case,
in
the
superintendent
case,
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case,
which
you'll
recall
and
the
first
one
was
a
--
a
rather
strenuously
contested
decision
within
the
court.
you
find
a
--
a
groping
for
--
for
the
dominant
policy
in
the
light
of
the
whole
picture.
now
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well
the
states
could
not
tax
the
property
of
an
indian
held
by
the
federal
government
without
specific
authority.
the
states
most
surely
could
tax
an
indian
living
in
portland
and
operating
a
real
state
business
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
the
quinaielts
are
--
are
not
tribal
indians
in
the
usual
sense.
my
friends
at
the
department
of
interior
tell
me
they
live
in
villages,
some
on
the
reservations,
some
off
the
reservation
that
there
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
some
of
them
are,
there
are
about
500,
i
believe,
who
are
still
full-blood.
they
--
these
group
of
indians,
i
don't
think
this
has
any
bearing
on
the
decision
in
the
case.
we
understand
that
this
group
of
indians
have
been
remarkably
integrated
into
the
community
out
there
into
the
extent
just
as
a
footnote
that
the
current
plans
look
to
the
complete
liquidation
of
the
federal
interest
in
this
area
in
the
next
three
to
four
years.
those
are
plans
which
are
now
under
discussion
with
the
tribal
councils.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
as
a
general
principle,
i
can't
say
the
contrary.
that's
absolutely
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
that
the
whole
history
was
involved.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
is
the
burden
--
burden
of
my
argument,
your
honor.
we
have
two
general
policies
that
come
in
conflict
and
we're
searching
for
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
--
of
the
purpose
of
congress
and
the
rather
confused
premises.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
you
mean,
why
--
well,
perhaps,
i
should
say
why
should
federal
judges
pay
income
tax?as
you
know
there
is
a
--
a
waiting
history
on
that
part.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
[laughs]
wouldn't
be
my
contention,
your
honor,
but
they
have
a
special
status
with
constitutional
warrant.(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes
sir,
i
think
that
may
be
characterized
as
a
self-inflicted
wound.
perhaps,
i'd
better
get
on
to
focus
on
some
of
the
particular
arguments
which
respondents
make.
the
respondents
have
not
chosen
to
argue
the
question
whether
the
annual
product
of
the
land
should
be
subject
to
tax.
suppose
instead
of
this
being
timber
land,
it
was
farm
land
and
there
were
an
annual
return
from
the
crops.
that
question
is
elaborately
briefed
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
because
it
is
addressed
to
a
lower
court
decision
which
is
tied
up
with
the
outcome
of
this
case.
this
--
this
question
of
whether
the
annual
return
should
be
taxed
or
not,
we
think,
within
the
context
of
the
--
of
the
discussion
we
have
just
had
is
a
relatively
easy
one.
on
the
sale
of
the
produce,
the
owner
realizes
income
or
gain
and
the
income
tax
laws
with
their
generality
require
that
he
pay
over
a
portion
of
that
gain
or
income
to
the
federal
government
as
his
share
of
the
common
burden.
payment
of
that
annual
obligation
isn't
inconsistent
in
any
way
with
the
obligation
of
the
federal
government
at
the
end
of
the
trust
period
to
deliver
the
fee
to
him,
free
of
all
charge
and
encumbrance.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
then
i
come
to
the
--
to
the
timber
question,
that
is
respondent's
argument.
he
says
timber
is
capital.
timber
is
not
the
annual
gain.
but
i
submit
that
for
income
tax
purposes,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
gain
is
realized
each
year
as
with
an
annual
crop
over
once
in
a
period
of
years,
as
in
a
livestock
operation
perhaps
or
a
timber
operation
or
whether
it's
derived
from
the
sale
of
the
land
itself.
in
all
of
those
cases
the
income
tax
provides
for
the
removal
from
the
proceeds,
the
exclusion
from
the
proceeds
of
such
part
thereof
as
represents
the
cost
of
production
in
the
case
of
manufacturing
operation
or
a
return
of
capital
in
the
case
of
a
long
term
timber
operation
or
a
sale
of
the
land.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
sale
of
the
land
or
the
timber
operation,
the
capital
gains
provisions
provide
for
the
exclusion
from
the
proceeds
of
the
cost
of
the
property.
if
it's
just
the
timber
and
not
to
be
of
such
portion
of
the
cost
is
attributable
to
the
timber,
or
in
the
case
the
property
was
acquired
as
this
was
prior
to
1913
of
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
as
of
1913.
certainly,
it's
late
in
the
day
to
suggest
that
a
tax
on
gain
on
capital
--
on
capital
gain
is
a
capital
levy
and
not
an
income
tax.
your
honor
will
recall
that
that
question
was
often
one
of
the
first
cases
under
this
1913
income
tax
and
this
court
held
that
gain
from
the
sale
or
exchange
of
a
capital
asset
was
taxable,
it
was
within
the
--
the
scope
of
the
income
tax
laws
as
enacted
by
congress,
it
was
not
an
unconstitutional
tax
as
an
unapportioned
direct
tax.
so,
we
think
that
whether
the
gain
be
derived
from
the
sale
of
crops,
from
the
sale
of
timber
or
from
the
sale
of
land,
the
question
is
the
same.
their
gain
is
realized.
the
--
return
on
capital
is
excluded
from
the
gain
and
a
tax
is
assessed
on
the
remainder.
respondents
argue
but
we
didn't
get
anything.
they
say
we
acquired
nothing
prior
to
the
sale
of
the
timber.
i
suggest
simply
that
that
is
not
the
fact.
they
had
a
vested
beneficial
interest
in
their
allotment
frm
the
date
of
the
patents
which
--
which
could
not
be
taken
away
from
it.
it
was
a
proper
divide
of
the
sort
which
is
recognized
everyday
for
purposes
of
imposition
of
the
income
tax.
in
another
facet
of
their
argument,
taxpayers
focus
on
this
obligation
to
deliver
the
land
at
the
end
of
the
trust
period
free
of
all
charge
and
encumbrance.
they
read
this
as
requiring
that
the
proceeds
of
the
land
be
maintained
intact
throughout
the
trust
period.
this
gets
close
to
the
core
of
their
contentions,
so
maybe
i
better
read
it
from
their
brief.at
page
14
on
the
top,
they
say
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes
--
yes,
it
is,
it
is.
they
say,
to
the
extent,
the
united
states
fails
to
setup
respondent
husband
with
all
his
capital
intact.
and
in
this
case,
the
most
important
part
of
his
capital
from
which
point
he
can
go
forward
with
a
chance
of
economic
survival
and
competition
with
others,
to
that
extent,
the
united
states
has
violated
its
trust.
they
seem
to
say
there
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
at
the
top
of
page
14
of
the
blue
brief.
there
are
several
amicus
briefs
as
well.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
no.
that
is
the
brief
of
the
respondents'
taxpayers
here.
to
paraphrase
it
slightly,
he
says
to
the
extent
--
to
the
extent
that
the
united
states
permits
the
invasion
of
the
proceeds
of
these
assets,
to
that
extent
they
violate
their
trust.
i
--
i
submit
they
can't
mean
that.
if
the
department
of
interior
insisted
on
maintaining

the

from
the
sale
of
this
timber,
they
would
be
the
first
to
complain.
respondents
sold
the
timber.
under
the
statutes,
he
has
the
use
of
the
proceeds
subject
to
supervision.
our
record
shows
that
he's
made
use
of
those
proceeds.
his
record
shows
he's
withdrawn
$1000
on
two
occasions
for
war
bonds,
$2000
for
a

$1500
to
complete

house,
responsible
expenditures
consistent
with
the
broad
purpose
of
bringing
these
indians
to
a
position
of
responsibility.
can
he
mean
them
that
the
government,
under
this
general
allotment
act,
has
an
obligation
to
keep
him
away
from
those
funds
and
not
to
let
them
--
him
use
them
for
economic,
productive
expenditures,
to
keep
the
funds
intact
perhaps
for
his
heirs,
i
--
i'm
sure
--
i'm
sure
not.
i
advanced
the
argument
that
way
because
i
think
it
throws
some
light
on
the
nature
of
the
trust.
the
united
states
has
not
undertaken
it
to
prevent
this
indian
from
enjoying
the
proceeds
of
his
land
or
the
timber
for
any
length
of
time,
or
it
is
not
undertaken
to
keep
him
from
the
proceeds
of
the
timber
until
he
enjoys
the
land.
the
applicable
statutes,
consistent
with
the
broad
congressional
policy
of
helping
these
indians,
take
an
economic
role
in
our
society
provide
for
the
sale
of
his
land
or
for
the
sale
of
his
timber
and
provide
that
the
proceeds
shall
be
subject
to
his
use
on
application,
thereafter.
upon
such
sale,
the
trust
and
the
obligations
of
the
united
states
which
go
with
the
trust
terminate
pro
tanto.
the
united
states
on
the
sale
of
the
timber
discharges
its
obligation
to
deliver
the
proceeds
--
well,
the
obligation
which
you
would
read
from
the
general
allotment
act
to
preserve
the
property
in
trust
for
him.
and
if
the
indian,
on
the
circumstances
of
this
sale,
realizes
the
gain
--
realizes
the
gain,
he's
not
taxed
on
any
increment
in
value
which
is
not
realized,
realizes
the
gain
and
has
that
money
income
available
for
his
purposes
or
be
it
under
supervision.
we
think,
the
indians,
like
others,
must
pay
a
tax
on
that
gain
as
their
share
of
the
common
burden.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
oh,
there
are,
of
course,
many
cases
of
condemnation
for
road
purposes,
for
irrigation
purposes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
procedure
would
have
been
the
same.
the
funds
derived
from
the
sale
of
the
land
to
the
government
determined
by
their
--
by
agreement
or
by
judicial
proceeding
would
be
paid
into
these
indians
account
for
his
use
on
approved
expenditures.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
if
these
indians
experience
is
typical
--
turned
over
to
him
as
he
requires
to
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i
--
as
--
as
i
say
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.(inaudible)
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
goes
into
the
indian's
account
for
his
use.
now
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
he
can
spend
that
money,
yes,
sir.
subject
to
supervision,
if
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
as
this
indian,
perhaps,
he
wants
to
buy
a
truck
and
go
into
trucking
business,
perhaps,
he
wants
to
buy
other
land
and
reestablish
himself
in
agricultural
pursuits
elsewhere.
perhaps
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
secretary
has
to
approve
any
substantial
expenditure.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
it's
over
$500.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
under
the
general
allotment
act,
the
government
agrees
to
convey
the
fee
to
him.
now,
i
would
rather
say,
instead
of
at
the
end
of
such
time,
at
--
as
--
at
such
time
as
the
indian
request
the
fee
or
the
timber
and
the
transfer
thereof
to
him
is
approved
by
the
secretary.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
secretary
of
interior
mandamus
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
could
he
mandamus
the
secretary
of
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
that
has
been
tried,
there
are
some
cases
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
if
i
could
generalize,
they
give
the
secretary
very
broad
discretion.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
at
the
--
under
the
current
regulations,
he
could.
up
until
1952,
they
were
more
restrictive.
that
--
that
policy
again
is
specific
--
to
the
specific
indians
and
the
specific
expenditures.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
we
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
we
--
we
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i
can
do
some
arithmetic.
i
understand
there
are
about
300,000
--
350,000
indians.
i
understand
that
above
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
three-quarters
of
the
land
held
by
indians
was
allotted
under
the
general
allotment
act.
and
i
understand
that
was
allotted
to
about
two-thirds
of
the
indians
so
that
would
be
150
--
200,000
probably
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
your
figures
may
be
more
current
than
mine,
a
third
of
a
million.
it's
a
figure
which
i
have
seen.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
i
sat
down,
mr.
justice
reed,
leaving
a
question
of
yours
hanging
which
i
lost
track
of
at
the
last
minute.
you
had
asked
how
about
condemnation?
and
i
answered
that
when
the
land
was
condemned
as
of
course
frequently
has
been
in
the
case
of
irrigation
works,
construction
of
roads
and
so
on,
the
proceeds
of
the
land
are
paid
into
the
individual
account
of
the
indian,
subject
to
withdrawal
by
him
under
supervision.
you
then
asked
under
the
general
allotment
act,
the
government
agrees
to
turn
it
back
to
him
at
the
end
of
the
period
and
that's
the
question
i
lost
track
of.
i
think
it
will
be
clearest
if
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
statute
which
deals
with
that
problem.
it's
on
page
43
of
our
brief,
the
act
of
june
25th,
1910.
this
section
8
applies
to
sales
of
timber,
another
section
and
i
believe
the
same
language
refers
to
the
sale
of
the
land
itself.
and
the
relevant
provisions
are
the
last
four
lines.
and
the
proceeds
thereof
shall
be
paid
to
the
allottee
or
disposed
of
for
his
benefit
under
regulations
to
be
prescribed
by
the
secretary
of
interior.
now,
my
suggestion
is
that
when
those
moneys
are
paid
to
him
at
his
request,
whatever
obligation
the
government
has
to
oversee
those
funds
or
to
oversee
the
proceeds
of
the
land,
comes
to
a
lawful
end.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
that
of
course
is
--
is
the
whole
question
before
us
today.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
depends
on
how
it
is
framed.
it
would
apply
so
far
as
i
know
to
all
persons
who
hold
allotments
under
the
general
allotment
act.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir,
there
are
a
great
many
that
do
not,
mostly
the
oklahoma
indians.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
some
of
the
oklahoma
indians
have
exemptions,
some
do
not.
it
is
a
complex
matter
specific
to
each
tribe.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
--
it
might
be
a
little
more
precise
to
say
that
some
indians
enjoy,
under
the
agreements
with
the
government,
specific
exemptions
from
tax
and
others
do
not.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
if
you
look
at
any
one
tribe,
of
course,
the
question
is
general.
if
you
look
at
the
whole
indian
problem,
each
one
is
somewhat
separate.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
position
--
yes.
the
position
of
the
commissioner
has
then
that
all
the
income
is
taxable,
excepting
those
indians
which
have
an
exemption
from
tax
in
so
many
words.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
your
honor?
mr.
charles
f.
barber
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
not
the
fact.
from
1913
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
no,
your
honor,
it
was
the
first
litigated
case
but
there
are
maybe
50
published
rulings
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
maybe
50
more
unpublished
that
bear
on
this
question.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
cohen
does
and
of
course
we
all
have
very
great
respect
for
mr.
felix
cohen.
his
statement
frankly
puzzles
me.
that
book
was
put
out
in
1942,
he
cites
no
authority
for
his
opinion,
he's
entitled
to
his
opinion
of
course.
but
what
puzzles
me
is
that
he
makes
no
reference
to
the
numerous
rulings
of
the
commissioner
to
the
contrary,
most
of
which
came
up
in
the
form
of
letters
from
the
commissioner
to
the
superintendent
of
indian
affairs.
moreover,
he
makes
no
reference
to
an
official
circular
of
the
department
of
interior,
a
public
document
directed
to
all
superintendents
in
1938
which
i
have
in
front
of
me
and
it
refers
to
the
decision
in
the
superintendent
case,
it
characterizes
the
holding
that
the
income
of
indians
is
subject
to
federal
income
tax
unless
specifically
exempted
by
treaty
or
act
of
congress
specifically
exempted.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
unless
therefore
there
is
a
specific
exemption
either
by
treaty
or
act
of
congress,
the
indian
should
file
returns
as
well
as
other
citizens
when
their
income
is
sufficient
to
bring
them
under
the
terms
of
the
federal
income
tax
law.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
department
of
interior,
office
of
indian
affairs,
miscellaneous
circular
number
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
as
i
say
this
--
this
hand
book
of
indian
law
puzzles
me.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
he
has
held
that
income
--
he
characterized
the
superintendent
case
as
holding
that
income
of
indians
is
subject
the
federal
income
tax
unless
specifically
exempted
by
treaty
or
act
of
congress,
unless
therefore
there
is
a
specific
exception
and
so
on.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
the
--
in
the
handbook,
he
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
he
refers
to
the
superintendent
case.
he
limits
it
to
income
on
income.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
now,
that
is
the
mary
blackbird
situation
in
chateau.
in
superintendent,
that
decision
was
relied
on
and
this
court
in
superintendent
said
--
quoted
along
these
lines,
"petitioner
contends
that
the
court
erred
in
not
following
its
reason
in
the
mary
blackbird
case."
it
quotes
that
reasoning
and
then
it
says
that
the
court
correctly
failed
to
follow
that
precedent
because
it
was
not
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
chateau.
i
might
mention
in
sitting
down
that
this
question
of
the
taxability
of
gain
on
sale
of
land
has
been
litigated,
a
tenth
circuit
case
in
76
f.2d
holds
that
the
gain
is
taxable
and
in
a
very
notorious
ruling
they
simply
--
the
commissioner
held
that
the
claim
of
judgment
fund
was
subject
--
the
aliquot
portion
to
each
indian
was
subject
to
the
federal
income
tax
on
the
capital
gain.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
that
is
the
case
of
dick
versus
commissioner,
76
f.2d
265
tenth
circuit,
certiorari
denied.
i
invite
your
attention
to
our
brief
in
opposition
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
if
this
court
held
that
the
income
directly
derived
from
alloted
land
or
land
subject
to
restrictions
or
land
subject
to
restrictions
of
any
sort.
you
see
in
the
oklahoma
and
kansas
situation,
the
fee
is
given
to
the
indians
subject
to
restrictions
then
there
would
be
uniformity
except
for
this
case.
there
are
many
treaty
which
say
that
the
land
shall
be
exempt
for
three
years
until
1931
or
for
ten
years
and
thereafter
shall
be
subject
to
all
federal
and
state
taxes.
now,
you
can't
avoid
those
provisions
which
look
both
ways.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
--
those
statutes
which
provide
and
thereafter
shall
be
taxable
are
indians
which
hold
not
under
the
general
allotment
act
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
but
in
the
oklahoma
and
kansas
situation
under
special
statutes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir,
we
refer
to
some
of
them
at
page
16
of
our
brief,
key
ones
which
show
the
theme.
and
if
you
will
look
in
our
brief
in
the
superintendent
case,
you
will
get
the
very
numerous
early
rulings
exhaustively
treated.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
the
footnote,
yes,
sir.
