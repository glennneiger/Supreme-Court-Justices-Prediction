how
the
indians,
in
our
case,
can
be
assimilated
in
--
in
significance
with
the
indians
in
choteau.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
what's
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
well,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
my
question
implies
that
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
equal
in
terms
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
officer
is
significant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
the
decision
--
decision
affected
both
case
to
tried
--
as
they
tried
or
was
the
decision
concerned
with
this
particular
within
choteau.
justice
felix
frankfurter
people
in
choteau
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
one
is
then
deployed
through
the
indians
properly,
one
must
remind
the
district
of
it,
a
different
state.
and
--
and
a
different
to
state
to
decide
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
a
guardian
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
guardian
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
united
states.
that's
--
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
ceded
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
were
--
as
you'll
--
as
you've
indicated
very
early
in
your
argument
of
the
department,
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
in
having
to
say
you
found
how
tricky
because
of
the
business
of
this,
with
legal
treasury,
legal
policy,
with
legal
conclusiveness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
case
of
indians
because
of
the
very
special
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
you
can't
just
abstractly
say,
contemplate
(inaudible)
the
congress
to
determine
where
--
wherever
there's
comes
from.
and
if
it
was
moderately
relieved
its
responsibility
on
the
one
hand
to
what
it
said
--
what
it
did
with
the
other
contextual,
that's
the
burden
with
your
argument,
is
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
exactly,
you
can
take
--
i'm
supposing
your
opening
remark
is
(inaudible)
out
of
the
context
of
what
you
derive
from
this
sentences,
complicated
variety
protected,
call
it
what
you
will,
the
position,
in
thousand
one
ways
in
which
it
doesn't
manifest
of
being
limited
to
this.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
none
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
you're
saying
is
--
what
you're
saying
is
--
is
the
power
to
--
that
the
power
to
indicate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
indicate,
probably
(inaudible)
had
been
expressed
by
appropriate
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
specifically
thought
it,
if
it
was
sought.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
find
in
the
body
of
treaty,
he
was
to
transfer
(inaudible)
in
the
exemption
clause
but
--
and
it
all
comes
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
treaties,
in
various
treaties
of
opinions
you
find
exemption,
specific
exemption
in
different
ways.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
there
were
taxes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
references
with
the
state
would
be
almost
consequently,
it
belongs
to
the
customs,
is
then
asked
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
have
to
be
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
--
must
have
--
must
that
phrase
be
readily
--
restrictedly
as
to
this
kind
of
practice
in
existence
at
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
that
act
or
the
laws
are
continued
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all,
when
the
generic
term
taxation
has
viewed,
i'm
not
sure
if
that
was
to
be
restricted
but
the
only
statute
that
instantly
falls
against
this
man
is
the
state
taxes
because
after
all,
long
before
the
1915
amendment
that
the
1915
amendment
can
constitute
tax
evasion
of
the
income
tax
that
the
prohibition
tax
amendment
is
right
in
ruling
for
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
the
justifications
of
cutting
it
down
into
the
tax
as
in
then
against
it
and
i
don't
think
at
all,
but
why
shouldn't
the
act
applies?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
indians
(inaudible)
we
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
consciously
reflect
with
the
interest
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about
--
we're
talking
about
private
indians.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they're
very
different
from
the
white
folks,
aren't
they,
in
their
general
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
talking
to
a
very
specifically
named
whether
the
term
taxation
(inaudible)
restrictions
here
as
to
be
used
(inaudible)
if
you
look
for
the
intent
in
any
sense
that
i
can't
accept
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
doesn't
mean
anything
to
me.
i
--
all
i
say
is
whether
you
had
that
special
interest
in
relation
to
the
problem.
the
indians
have
(inaudible)
and
to
relatively
reach
this
as
--
as
usual
a
thought
now
to
be
treated
and
specifically
in
the
united
states,
the
people
living
in
the
united
states
are
generally
included.
as
a
--
as
a
general
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
derived
more
competence
that
should
met
with
intervention
than
we
were
entitled.but
eventually,
why
should
not
this
differentiation
ought
to
apply
the
taxation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
merely
an
immaterial
proceeding?
i
mean,
did
he
request
that
for
the
secretary
of
interior
mandamusable
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
so
that
he
couldn't
--
by
merely
asking
for
him
to
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
do
you
happen
to
have
suggestion
concerning
the
importance,
the
number
of
indians
to
have
a
holding
similar
to
the
respondent's
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
number
of
the
individuals
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
brief
has
a
little
difference
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
abridge,
what
is
it
that
you
stand
on
which
you
claim
to
embrace
the
question
of
abridgment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it's
the
statute
that
you
read
about
taxation
encompass
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
trust
patent,
you
mention,
we
haven't
--
i
haven't
heard
about
that
until
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
fine.
i
have
the
record
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
to
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
land
that
remained
without
a
single
cut
it
will
go
to
--
as
it
was
and
that
this
is
merely
a
transmutation
of
the
land
it
involves?
justice
felix
frankfurter
prior
to
that
--
if
you're
right
about
that
doesn't
cover
that
case
or
this
case.
if
you're
right
about
that
this
is
an
agreement
then
i
shouldn't
think
congress
could
agree
to
respectively
cut
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say,
mr.
cragun,
if
--
i
wouldn't
urge
but
(inaudible)
if
the
argument
which
prevails
--
which
prevailed
in
evans
against
gore
was
laid
around
to
act
(inaudible)
that
the
constitutional
provision
about
taxing
federal
(inaudible)
or
maybe
the
government
(inaudible)
does
have
--
that
limitation
doesn't
--
doesn't
mean
there
shouldn't
be
protection
to
what
everybody
else
is
protecting,
does
it
refer
to
the
government's
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
mr.
barber
would
make
an
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
is
as
though
congress
is
providing
that
the
salary
of
judges
went
on
to
say
it
cannot
be
subject
to
any
incumbency
in
that
taxation,
in
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
not
suggesting
to
that
direction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
shows
great
(inaudible)
in
you
and
not
made
that
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
trying
to
enter
(inaudible)
that's
slightly
relevant
to
the
problem
before
us
to
have
a
very
thoughtful
conclusion
(inaudible)
all
i'm
saying
is
(inaudible)
but
that's
not
the
wisest
thing
from
the
large
aspect
of
civilization
at
least
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
express
--
i
don't
express
my
view,
i'm
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
who's
circular
is
that,
mr.
barber?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
refer
to
the
superintendent
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
different
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
