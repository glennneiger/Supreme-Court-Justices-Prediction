justice
harold
burton
as
i
understand
it,
this
indian
is
--
it
is
not
a
competent
indian.
justice
harold
burton
will
you
at
least
admit
that
his
--
his
assist
could
trust.
justice
harold
burton
that
the
government
here
is
--
is
the
trustee.
justice
harold
burton
it's
a
good
relationship.
justice
harold
burton
and
you
say
that
the
government
can
--
the
government
can
tax
here
because
the
indian
can't
show
that
he's
exempt
from
the
general
sweep
of
this
income
tax
law.
justice
harold
burton
what
do
you
say
to
the
--
the
proposition
that
assisted
with
trust
and
doesn't
have
to
show
any
exemption
through
the
revelation
--
of
his
state
but
that
the
trustee
would
have
to
show
express
authority
to
diminish
his
state
for
his
own
interest.
in
other
words,
the
--
justice
harold
burton
in
other
words
the
--
the
taxpayer
don't
have
to
show
that
the
--
doesn't
have
to
show
an
exemption
but
rather
the
--
the
trustee
has
to
show
that
he
has
to
express
authority
of
tax.
justice
harold
burton
the
ordinary
relationship
--
justice
harold
burton
yes.
justice
harold
burton
but
--
justice
harold
burton
what
i'm
talking
about
is
that
could
the
ward
diminished
the
--
could
the
--
the
guardian
diminished
the
words
he
state
for
his
own
benefit
without
to
express
authority?
justice
harold
burton
the
united
states
out
of
the
ordinary
rules
of
--
of
trust
relationship.
justice
harold
burton
the
state
certainly
could
not
tax
an
indian
without
expressed
authority
from
congress.
justice
harold
burton
why
should
--
why
should
--
justice
harold
burton
i'm
talking
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
why
should
there
be
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
--
why
should
--
why
should
they
be
treated
differently
then
in
taxation?
justice
harold
burton
we're
in
the
class
of
indians.
justice
harold
burton
it's
a
contemplated
warrant.
it
is
a
self-inflicted
wound.
[laughter]
justice
harold
burton
mr.
cragun,
do
you
treat
on
a
different
basis
the
annual
crops
from
timber
to
make
a
distinction
between
them?
justice
harold
burton
but
mr.
cragun
--
mr.
cragun,
do
you
put
any
limit
on
the
oil
and
the
--
and
the
mineral
part,
could
it
make
some
use
of
those
or
they
must
all
be
preserved?
justice
harold
burton
now,
suppose
we
have
spread
the
--
cut
a
timber
over
many
years
and
no
one
cut
a
small
fraction
each
year
in
order
he
might
have
the
--
continue
the
reforestation
of
it.
justice
harold
burton
or
raising
the
question
to
apply
it
to
the
93
but
it
was
on
--
on
matter
of
a
principle
as
to
whether
or
not
--
and
there
wasn't
some
income
derivable
on
that
basis
whether
it
was
for
oil
or
whether
it
was
for
annual
crop.
justice
harold
burton
but
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
--
principle
if
it's
a
flat
sale,
flat
sale
as
--
as
it
was
here,
you
--
you
don't
allow
anything
for
that
annual
feature
of
it
or
for
--
for
the
income
feature
of
it,
you
called
all
capital.
justice
harold
burton
well,
you've
been
cutting
it
every
year,
but
i
mean
suppose
over
a
period
of
25
years
they
have
been
an
--
an
accumulation
of
annual
growth
prior
in
that
income.
