mr.
john
w.
cragun
may
it
please
the
court.
there
have
been
questions
raised
by
counsel
and
by
the
court.
they
seem
rather
reasonable
to
me
but
unfortunately,
our
record
doesn't
cover
them
very
well.
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
them.
first
place,
i
hadn't
heard
before
that
these
indians
get
about
half
of
their
income
from
fishing
and
half
from
timber.
it
couldn't
be
true
as
to
the
individual,
any
--
given
the
individual
of
--
they're
fishing
indians.
they're
wonderful
fisherman
who
have
log
canoes
and
they
can
take
them
out
in
the
ocean
and
they
are
experts
with
salmon
and
the
other
fish
that
ran
there.
but
timber
isn't
something
that
a
man
can
go
out
and
take
a
log
off
of
his
allotment
and
carry
them
to
the
mill
and
sell
it.
it
isn't
a
crop
of
that
kind.
it's
only
a
crop
in
the
sense
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres.
and
when
on
the
olympic
peninsula,
they
tried
to
get
enough
land
together
to
do
that,
there
are
formal
agreements.
there
is
one
embodied
in
the
statute,
i
understand
it,
whereby
the
national
forest
and
a
large
private
timber
company
or
logging
company
can
throw
their
acreage
in
the
hotchpotch
so
that
they
can
cut
off
enough
per
year
to
keep
it
forever
productive.
this
is
not
tribal
timber
that
we're
talking
about
at
all.
there's
almost
no
tribal
timber
on
the
quinaielt
reservation.
the
reservation
is
almost
100%
allotted.
these
are
reservation
indians.
this
--
this
respondent
and
his
wife
lived
at
the
very
small
fishing
village
of
taholah
at
the
mouth
of
the
quinault
river
on
the
western
slope
of
the
olympic
mountains.
the
discussion
as
to
whether
what
is
involved
here
was
income
derived
from
the
land,
those
were
almost
magic
words
to
the
court
and
i
did
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
that
too.
it
was
a
phrase
that
was
used
a
few
times
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
income
from
whatever
source
derive,
says
the
constitution
and
the
court
as
counsel
has
said,
has
held
from
a
long
time
back
that
income
can
be
derived
in
many
respects.
it
can
be
derived
from
the
sale
of
timber.
there
was
not
renew
that
the
argument
of
statement
repeated
in
several
times
in
petitioner's
brief
that
this
indian
was
engaged
in
the
cutting
and
sale
of
timber,
that
is
to
say
the
logging
business
wherein
one
buys
some
logs
and
--
and
they
cut
them
and
take
them
to
the
mill
and
sell
them
for
profit.
this
indian
had
his
allotment
cut
along
with
the
allotments,
i
believe,
of
18
others
according
to
what
we're
informed
by
indian
office.
he
gave
a
power
of
attorney
permitting
the
superintendent
to
enter
into
a
contract
on
his
behalf.
there
was
one
contract
covering
a
thousand
74
acres
entered
into
with
a
logger,
one
who
--
whose
business
is
cutting
and
sale
of
timber.
that
logger
was
the
aloha
lumber
company.
the
indian
didn't
get
the
logs.
this
wasn't
just
a
contract
to
cut
trees.
this
company
bought
the
standing
timber,
cut
the
logs
and
hold
them
off
to
the
mill
itself,
made
what
--
made
its
profit
in
that
way.
i
am
bound
to
admit,
of
course,
that
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
make
income
from
the
sale
of
the
land.
you
can
sell
a
land
and
you
can
make
the
profit
on
it.
and
i'm
bound
to
say
further
that
this
court
has
held
all
in
such
cases
as
with
state
bonds.
the
federal
government
can't
tax
the
income
derived
from
them,
but
this
court
long
ago
in
willcuts
against
bunn
way
down
the
(inaudible)
that
the
federal
government
can
tax
the
profit
which
is
made
upon
the
sale
of
state
bonds
even
though
the
income
directly
derived
from
the
bonds
itself
was
exempt.
accordingly,
more
in
the
brief
than
in
the
oral
argument
in
this
particular
respect,
it
has
been
urged
by
petitioner
that
while
we're
merely
taxing,
not
the
land
itself
but
the
profit
which
arises
upon
the
sale
of
that
land.
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
cover
it
since
it
is
touched
in
this
--
this
is
income
derived
from
the
land
which
we're
taxing.
it's
not
at
all
the
usual
case
where
a
man
goes
out
and
sells
his
land
and
makes
a
profit.you
have
another
problem
here
entirely.
you
have
reservation
indians
who
have
never
got
that
land.
it's
true,
they
can
get
the
land
if
they
apply
for
a
patent.
and
if
upon
review
of
their
situation,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
says,
yes.
i
think
that
you're
entitled
to
a
patent.
you
have
now
got
along
to
the
point
where
you've
got
a
--
a
truck
and
you've
got
a
couple
of
war
bonds
and
i
think
it
might
make
sense.
i'll
give
you
a
patent
to
it.
you
are
henceforth
competent
and
he
could
go
ahead.
that
point,
so
far,
in
this
case,
has
been
reached
only
to
the
extent
that
on
some
little
applications,
some
money
for
beneficial
purposes
has
been
risked
on
this
indian,
to
that
extent
only
has
he
got
his
capital
to
start
out
with.
he
goes
out
and
makes
profit
on
it.
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
in
this
case,
he's
taxable
on
it.
it's
like
the
reinvestment
income
which
was
concerned
in
the
case
of
superintendent
of
five
civilized
tribes
which
is
relied
upon
so
closely
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
the
fact
is
that
you
do
have,
as
counsel
says,
two
policies
here.
you
have
the
policy.
he
adverted
to
the
decision
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
glenshaw
glass
case
that,
of
course,
the
income
tax
means
to
--
the
income
tax
statutes
mean
to
bring
within
their
sweep
of
all
profits.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
it
would
not
exempt
from
taxation
the
treble
damages
that
a
plaintiff
gets
on
a
--
an
antitrust
action.
that
policy
means
to
bring
within
it,
but
there
is
a
policy
of
congress
which
antedates
that
which
is
good
right
down
the
date.
it's
been
unchanged
by
congress
that
the
--
this
land
of
the
indian
shall
be
withheld
from
the
dissipation
which
he
might,
otherwise,
make
from
it
until
he's
considered
a
good
enough
risk
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
he
is
accorded
his
certificate
of
competency
and
his
free
patent.
now,
it
is
--
it's
been
said
in
very
plain
language.
i
believe
that
this
language
of
the
statute
is
scarcely
open
to
question
as
to
what
the
congressional
policy
is
when
it
said
that
at
the
end
of
that
time,
when
he
gets
this
certificate
of
competency,
he
is
to
receive
his
land
in
free
discharge
of
sub-trust
and
free
of
all
charge
or
encumbrance,
whatsoever.
encumbrance
is
an
ordinary
way
you
can
dilute
or
diminish
the
value
of
the
land
before
the
man
gets
it.
now,
in
this
case,
he
used
to
get
that
land
before
he
becomes
subject
to
taxation.
statute
says,
only
thereafter,
shall
his
land
be
subject
to
encumbrance,
sale,
or
taxation.
now
that
being
established,
question
is
what
happens
to
the
proceeds
of
timber?
over
a
--
an
indian
office
in
a
letter
to
this
individual
which
i've
received
on
inquiry
since
i
was
very
much
concerned
with
some
of
the
interpretations
of
this
record,
which
could
have
been
more
specific,
had
the
counsel
foreseen
what
was
coming,
says
that
up
from
this
allotment,
this
little
93
and
a
quarter
acres
of
land,
there
was
cut
over
three-and-a-quarter
million
feet
of
timber,
marginal
timber
for
which
proceeds
were
paid
under
the
government
account.
now,
that
is
the
trust
raised.
it's
the
overwhelming
value
of
that
land.
stamp
ranchers
can't
farm
it.
they
have
finally
found
out,
it's
a
matter
of
common
notice
--
it's
only
partially
supported
by
the
record
here.
i
have
covered
some
of
the
common
knowledge
of
the
olympic
peninsula
country
in
the
brief
and
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
justice,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
i've
taken
no
position
on
it.
i
can
assume
for
the
sake
of
my
argument
that
they're
fully
taxable.
if
the
indian
goes
out
and
exploits
his
allotment,
if
he's
got
an
allotment
on
which
he
can
raise
grain,
as
in
julia
nicodemus'
case
or
that
he
can
lease
out
for
grain
growing,
as
in
mr.
gary's
case,
both
recent
decisions
of
lower
courts,
the
latter
one
in
the
tax
court
and
the
first
one
i
mentioned
of
the
u.s.
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
washington.
i
assume
that
they
can
be
taxed,
although,
one
court
holds
one
light
and
the
other
holds
the
other
in
those
opinions.
it's
ably
briefed
in
this
case
by
counsel
for
julia
nicodemus,
mr.
delwel
who
has
filed
the
brief
and
by
counsel
in
the
taunah
case
in
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
some
years
ago,
mr.
hill
and
those
associated
with
him.
i
--
i
would
rather
permit
those
briefs
to
stand
for
themselves.
i
assume
for
the
sake
of
this
argument
that
annual
product
of
the
land
is
taxable.
the
matter
here
of
the
proceeds
of
the
land,
the
capital,
the
essential
value
of
this
land,
go
into
the
trust
account.
they
stand
in
place
of
it.
congress
has
said
in
support
of
what
i
urge
upon
this
court
to
be
a
perfectly
valid
policy
for
congress
to
adopt
that
those
proceeds
are
to
be
unimpaired,
that
the
indian
is
to
receive
them
at
the
end
of
the
time
without
diminution,
which
is
what
encumbrance
means.
it
--
it
follows
as
a
result
that
until
he's
got
that,
he
hasn't
got
the
basic
requirement
for
making
a
capital
gain
on
this
land.
he
hasn't
yet
received
the
trust
raise
and
the
circumstances
and
under
the
conditions
which
congress
has
provided
as
a
means
of
solution
for
the
indian
problem.
as
gratified,
they
hear
a
counsel
for
petitioner
say
that
he
had
become
amazed
that
the
complexity
of
these
indian
problems
when
he
gets
into
the
peculiar
statutes
and
arrangements
that
have
been
made
which
distinguished
one
tribe
from
another.
most
of
us,
and
i
suppose
the
way
we're
raised
seem
to
think
that
indians
mean
plains
indians
with
feathers
and
tomahawks
and
things
of
that
kind.
the
indian
cultures
are
as
varied
as
can
be
supposed
that's
adequately
covered
by
anthropologist
who
have
written
rather
popularly
on
it
like
ms.
benedict's
"patterns
of
culture"
comes
to
mind
off
hand,
showing
the
extremes
of
difference
in
the
indian
tribes
in
this
country,
where
they
originally
have
no
name
for
another
tribe
which
would
distinguish
him
as
an
indian
like
themselves,
where
they
regarded
another
tribe
almost
usually
as
being
as
different
from
them
as
would
be
a
white
man
from
them.
they
each
present
separate
problems.
congress
did
try
a
horizontal
across
the
board's
solution
of
this
in
the
general
allotment
act.
it
has
confirmed
its
view
in
that
act
from
time
to
time
that
it
shall
be
untaxable
until
the
money
is
received.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
a
problem
here,
as
i
was
saying
at
the
lunch
and
recess,
appears
to
be
a
situation
where
indeed
the
income
tax
act
may
intend
to
include
all
income,
but
in
which
we
have
an
earlier
statute
and
a
different
purpose
and
policy
of
congress
with
a
question
whether
that
has
been
repealed,
whether
that
has
been
repealed
by
implication,
whether
that
policy
has
in
any
respect
been
vitiated
by
congress
and
we
look
in
vain
for
any
indication
that
congress
has
vitiated
it.
there
was
nothing
particular
as
that
of
the
opinions
below
in
this
case
or
in
the
correlative
of
cases
i
have
briefly
mentioned
to
recent
decisions,
one
by
the
tax
court,
one
by
the
district
court
in
eastern
district
of
washington.
but
in
this
court,
in
this
case,
we
have
judge
fee
in
district
court
and
three
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
all
concurring
in
the
view
expressed
and
in
the
tenth
circuit
on
the
basis
of
unasserted
conflict
with
which
i
believe
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari.
we
have
not
only
district
judge
chandler,
but
chief
judge
phillips
rather
overwhelmingly
the
judges
of
the
lower
court
seem
to
have
gone
along
with
this.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
a
related
point
on
this
matter
of
what
the
general
understanding
or
effect
of
this
is
and
the
fact
that
congress
has
never
seemed
fit
to
abridge
that
same
as
regards
to
be
civic
crimes
in
specific
localities
in
oklahoma.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
(inaudible)
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
your
honor,
that's
part
of
it.
it's
also
written
into
the
expressed
undertaking
of
this
indian,
the
so-called
trust
patent.
i
might
mention
that
there
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
trust
patent
appears
at
page
13,
your
honor,
and
on
page
14
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
--
of
the
record.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
in
--
the
trust
patent
handed
to
this
very
respondent
for
the
--
the
united
states
does
and
will
hold
the
land
thus
alloted
subject
to
all
statutory
provisions
and
restrictions
for
the
period
of
25
years,
in
trust
for
the
sole
use
and
benefit
of
the
said
indian,
and
that
at
the
expiration
of
said
period
the
united
states
will
convey
the
same
by
patent
to
said
indian
in
fee,
discharged
of
said
trust
and
free
of
all
charge
or
incumbrance
whatsoever.
we
have
the
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
but
that's
the
exact
language
of
the
statute,
sir.
i
don't
know
that
the
so-called
trust
patent
could
rise
above
it
but
it
is
an
expressed
contract
undertaking
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no,
these
lands
are
not
taxed
by
the
state
of
washington,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that
is
correct,
sir,
precisely.
that
--
that
future
time
have
this
standing
timber
remain
and
it
still
remains
on
many
allotments
there
and
the
land
is
acquired
by
the
individual
in
fee,
he'll
have
a
basis
for
a
capital
gains
tax
or
even
for
that
unlikely
situation
that
he
might
try
to
apply
the
timber
depletion
charges
which
as
petitioner's
counsel
correctly
said
are
angled
at
the
tremendous
operations
and
not
at
the
individual
landowner
at
all.
but
he
then
have
his
basis
for
capital
gains
tax
such
as
is
applied
here.
thus
far,
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress
that
he
shall
have
that
put
in
his
hands
has
not
been
realized.
i
was
on
the
point
of
saying
in
connection
with
this
policy
of
congress
that
congress
has
proved
itself
perfectly
able
to
direct
in
a
different
disposition
of
these
matters
tax-wise,
should
the
situation
of
the
particular
tribe
and
the
situation
of
a
particular
locality
require
in
a
number
of
cases
in
oklahoma.
congress
by
specific
statute
made
certain
of
these
lands
subject
to
certain
and
expressed
taxes
and
those
statutes
have
them
before
the
court
in
other
cases.
also,
oklahoma
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
this
court
has
held
twice
that
it
could
not.
in
choate
against
trapp,
it
expressly
ruled
it
and
it
later
reaffirmed
it
in
--
in
carpenter
against
shaw
in
280
u.s.,
it's
held
that
it
is
a
contract
right
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
indians
as
individuals
like
this
are
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment,
they
are
persons.
indian
tribes
have
been
held
to
be
political
entities,
they
are
still
are.
the
quinaielt
tribe
on
these
reservations
still
enacts
its
own
law,
enforces
its
own
custom,
does
its
own
policing
of
the
kind
that
it
believes
in
and
it
takes
care
of
its
own
disputes
amongst
its
own
people,
say
for
the
ten
federal
crimes
which
are
subject
to
trial
in
federal
courts,
congress
has
intervened
there.
but
that's
a
political
entity,
its
not
protected
and
i
merely
mentioned
it
so
that
it
won't
be
confused,
the
cases
where
this
court
has
held
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
protect
a
tribe
and
tribal
property
because
it
has
held
specifically
with
respect
to
the
individual,
he
is
protected.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
justice
burton,
i
believe
--
we
so
asserted
in
connection
with
the
response
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
the
situation
of
oil
and
gas
production
in
land
is
different
from
the
standing
timber
in
the
way
it
might
be
handled
for
tax
purposes,
that
view
is
not
shared
by
either
of
the
amici
in
this
case.
but
i
believe
that
it
is
possible
consistently
with
the
purpose
of
the
general
allotment
act
and
these
restrictions
where
this
court
to
draw
a
line
between
the
situation
where
there
is
annual
income
from
the
land
in
the
sense
of
oil
and
gas
royalties.
where
the
lessee
is
in
effect
in
partnership
with
him
who
is
producing
the
oil
and
gas
and
gets
a
share
of
that
oil
and
gas
and
who
can
deplete
that
share
in
his
income
tax
return
and
so
restore
it
to
himself
in
that
sense
the
value
of
the
capital
asset.
i
believe
it's
possible
for
this
court
to
say,
"well,
yes,
that's
annual
income
of
the
land
which
is
taxable
and
you're
getting
your
--
an
adequate
return
of
your
capital
through
the
depletion
allowance,"
whereas
the
court
would
still
be
required
in
a
situation
such
as
this.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
that
is
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
your
honor.
we
requested
in
our
brief
that
if
there's
any
disposition
and
the
court
to
dispose
of
this
case
on
a
suggestion
that
there
is
a
sustained
yield
program
on
this
93.25
acres
of
land
that
the
case
be
remanded.
i
make
the
assertion
that
it
is
completely
impossible
for
a
logging
operation
to
be
carried
out
on
that
basis
with
respect
to
one
allotment
or
even
many
allotments
of
this
kind.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
your
honor
that
is
possible.
if
you
have
a
big
enterprise
where
you're
taking
out
a
little
each
year
and
can
continue
that
forever
and
there
are
such
operations
before
services
and
partnership
with
private
lumber
companies
on
at
least
two
of
them
that
have
been
sanctioned
by
statute.
the
--
there
is
a
little
taken
out
any
year
and
it
goes
on
indefinitely
so
far
as
anybody
knows
unless
it's
--
it's
interrupted
by
disease
or
fire
or
something
else
it
will
go
on
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
--
trying
to
foresee
the
future.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
annual
increment
on
virgin
forest
is
nil,
your
honor.
there
--
there
just
wasn't
any,
the
year
they
cut
this.
if
you
got
a
virgin
forest,
it's
a
forest
which
has
--
has
reached
a
stabilized
point
and
the
amount
of
windthrow
and
decay
of
rock
and
loss
in
that
way
offsets
the
annual
growth,
there
isn't
an
annual
income.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
it
might
--
it
might
conceivably
be
if
you
can
reduce
it
to
some
annual
basis,
your
honor,
but
never
in
this
man's
life
time
will
there
be
another
crop
on
this
land.
he
will
never
get
but
the
one
virgin
crop
that
was
there
when
it
was
cut,
when
it
was
allotted
to
him
and
later
--
years
later
when
it
was
cut,
it
will
--
it
may
go
to
his
heirs
or
his
land
may
be
sold
and
somebody
else
acquired.
there
may
be
some
other
disposition
and
it
may
become
an
annual
tax
matter.
as
it
stands
on
this
record,
i
believe
it's
perfectly
fine.
it
was
capital
that
he
was
to
get
in
the
future,
part
of
that
capital
was
converted.
the
government
helped
itself
to
a
part
of
those
converted
proceeds
for
taxes.
he
has
not
got
that
capital
asset
in
the
first
place.
if
he
did,
i
concede
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
taxes.
i
do
so
concede
with
respect
to
so
much
of
the
--
of
this
converted
trust
as
has
been
put
in
his
hands.
that
is
if
he
makes
money
with
his
truck
which
counsel
says
he
purchased,
i
think
that
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
it.
i
believe
so
much
is
established
by
earlier
decisions
of
this
court,
especially
in
superintendent
of
five
civilized
tribes.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
sir,
i
know
of
no
case
holding
that
it
is
taxable.
the
way
that
trust
land
is
sold
in
fee
as
an
ordinary
proposition
is
to
grant
the
individual
the
certificate
of
competency
and
his
fee
simple
title.
he
then
goes
ahead
and
sells
it.
now,
there
are
pending
just
within
the
last
year
or
two,
two
cases
that
i
know
of
in
idaho
where
a
collector
of
internal
revenue
has
asserted
the
right
to
take
the
value,
deduct
from
the
proceeds
of
fee
patented
land
that
sold,
not
the
value
when
the
individual
finally
got
it
in
fee
but
the
value
way
back
when
it
was
allotted
to
him
before
he
had
attained
this
competency
and
became
entitled
to
sell
it
and
before
he
had
got
his
certificate.
those
cases
have
not
yet
reached
the
court
stage,
i
know
of
no
others.
i
know
of
no
--
no
effort
the
government
has
made
to
tax
land,
restricted
or
trust
patent
lands.
those
terms
means
almost
the
same
thing,
restricted
patents
are
now
in
oklahoma
trust
patent
rivers,
where
else.
i
know
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
to
the
extent
that
any
is
sold,
the
government
certainly
holds
the
funds.
he
can't
get
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
know
of
no
occasion
where
they
have
tried
to
collect
an
income
tax
from
such
proceeds
if
for
instance
land
was
condemned.
it's
the
only
circumstance
in
which
i
can
suppose
that
there
would
be
a
sale
of
trust
land
except
such
sales
as
occurred
here,
i
know
of
no
case,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
if
the
court
please,
it
is
our
position
that
this
should
not
be
taxed,
that
it
doesn't
get
on
a
level
where
it
can't
be
taxed
under
the
congressional
scheme,
the
congressional
policy
until
it
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
l.r.t.
in
fee,
then
to
be
sure
he
is
subject
to
taxation
just
as
is
everyone
else.
first,
though
congress
has
said
he
shall
have
his
land
in
fee,
here
that's
frustrated
the
part
because
he
and
the
government
agree,
his
agreement
i
suppose
is
necessary
because
of
the
protection,
he
is
an
individual,
enjoys
under
the
fifth
amendment.
he
and
the
government
agree
that
the
government
will
sell
his
timber
along
with
that
of
a
number
of
others
and
thereupon
part
of
his
prospective
capital
is
converted
into
a
different
form.
but
the
government
still
holds
that
in
trust
and
it's
not
ordinary
income,
it's
a
part
of
that
capital
that
was
standing
on
the
--
the
land.
of
course
i'm
aware,
if
the
court
please,
of
the
decisions
stemming
from
willcuts
against
bunn.
i
mentioned
before
the
lunch
and
recess
that
what's
taxed
is
not
the
thing
itself,
the
state
bonds
themselves,
it's
the
transaction
in
the
bonds.
here,
it's
the
sale
of
the
timber.
well,
i
suppose
we
could
carry
that
to
the
ridiculous
point
you
say
the
congress
could
enact
a
direct
tax
against
real
estate
but
call
it
an
excise
and
say
this
isn't
a
tax
on
the
real
estate
at
all.
this
is
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
owning
real
estate.
if
--
we're
almost
to
such
an
extreme
position
to
apply
it
here
and
this
court
has
considered
whether
this
language
of
the
general
allotment
act
should
be
construed
to
permit
the
imposition
of
a
state
inheritance
tax
on
restricted
land.
now,
mr.
justice
black
in
an
earlier
opinion,
in
united
states
trust
company
against
helvering,
had
held
that
clearly
the
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
shifting
of
economic
benefits,
the
transfer
upon
death
and
not
upon
the
property
itself.
when
it
came
to
indian
lands
in
the
319
u.s.
oklahoma
tax
commission
case,
he
held
that
they
could
include
trust
property
of
the
indian
merely
by
virtue
of
its
--
being
held
in
trust
by
the
government
such
as
a
stocks
and
bonds
and
cash
were
part
of
it.
but
when
it
came
to
his
allotment
which
was
held
thereunder
these
restrictions
against
incumbrance,
he
held
the
majority
of
the
court
did
not
believe
that
that
principle
of
united
states
trust
company
against
helvering
applies
to
the
restricted
allotment.
this
court
has
passed
on
that
and
it
doesn't
make
a
better
governance
that
at
the
time
the
general
allotment
act
was
passed,
you
didn't
have
state
inheritance
taxes.
that
was
followed
by
two
decisions
in
the
court
of
claims.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
latter
one
of
them,
holding
that
the
federal
state
tax
does
not
apply
to
these
trust
lands
which
are
under
these
restrictions
which
are
go
--
are
to
go
as
i
read
from
the
patent,
as
also
it
says
in
the
statute
in
same
language
to
be
delivered
to
the
individual
or
his
heirs
without
incumbrance.
i'd
--
i
believe
that
there
is
pretty
general
uniformity
in
the
decision,
again
with
respect
to
these
landman
cases,
the
two
in
the
court
of
claims
that
i
mentioned
that
came
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
319
u.s.
oklahoma
tax
commission
case.
it
didn't
make
any
difference
that
the
federal
or
state
tax
wasn't
in
being
at
the
time
the
general
allotment
act
was
passed
or
at
the
time
the
--
the
particular
patent
was
issued.
that
restriction
against
diminution
of
the
property
of
the
allottee
applied
to
whatever
sort
of
diminution
was
involved,
whether
it
meant
taking
out
part
of
it
for
in
a
state
tax,
a
state
inheritance
tax
or
--
i
urge
that
the
court
must
hold
an
income
tax.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
it's
very
fully
briefed
there
and
i
--
commencing
on
page
29.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
it
is
made.
i
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
regarded
it
as
being
merely
ad
hominem
that
the
court
should
feel
so
sorry
for
itself
that
it
has
committed
this
self-inflicted
wound
which
mr.
justice
minton
referred
to
upon
itself
that
it
should
turn
around
and
say,
"well,
we'll
pay
no
attention
to
the
congressional
policy,
deliberately
adopted
and
still
on
the
books
with
respect
to
a
completely
different
problem,
the
problem
of
indians
and
we
are
going
to
hold
them
taxable."
the
government
uses
the
term,
"i
did
pay
my
respects
to
that."
i
couldn't
withhold
saying
something
about
that
in
my
own
brief.
the
government
makes
the
argument
that
indians
should
be
taxed
just
the
same
as
everyone
else.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
policy
with
respect
to
federal
judges
which
this
court
examined
and
enunciated,
not
only
in
evans
against
gore
but
in
the
later
cases,
was
completely
repudiating
it,
is
a
completely
different
policy
than
that
which
congress
has
applied
with
respect
to
the
indians.
you
were
faced
--
well,
the
court
was
faced
in
that
situation
with
regard
to
judge's
salaries,
with
the
question
what
is
the
policy
of
the
third
article
of
the
constitution?
there
was
no
problem
there
about
acculturating
judges,
no
problem
there
of
--
of
tribal
judges
that
we
have
somehow
to
lean
over
to
a
different
sort
of
life.
i
cannot
see
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
[laughs]
i'm
trying
not
to
be
drawn
into
giving
my
own
suggestions
on
that
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me
completely
apart
from
the
question
here
which
is
what
congress
has
provided,
what
has
been
done
by
the
administrative
officials
pursuant
to
that
direction.
counsel
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
--
i
believe
that
you
could
refrain
from
that.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
thank
you,
sir.
maybe
it
would
appeal
to
the
court
a
little
more
if
i
did
make
the
argument.[laughter]
mr.
john
w.
cragun
the
point
has
been
made
that
we
must,
here,
find
some
express
exemption
by
congress
from
the
income
tax
act,
the
broad
sweep
of
the
act
that
was
mentioned.
of
course
we
have
that,
we
have
a
completely
different
problem,
i
urge
the
court
on
the
other
side
as
i
have
said
that
its
a
problem
of
whether
you
are
going
to
hold
for
a
repeal
by
implication
of
that
earlier
language
in
the
language
of
the
tax
act.
i
believe
that
it
cannot
be
found
in
the
light
of
the
history
of
the
congressional
policy
which
here
is
involved,
but
it
does
fundamentally
come
down
to
what
is
the
congressional
policy
with
respect
to
the
allotment
of
indians.
they
provided
for
the
general
allotment
act
where
back
in
1887.
isn't
it
about
time
the
25
years
run
up,
we
might
ask
when
they're
going
to
change
it?
well,
there
again,
it's
up
to
congress
to
change
that
if
it's
to
be
changed,
i
suppose
any
of
us
can
look,
just
peek
a
little
bit
and
see
why
congress
hasn't
done
it,
it's
because
the
general
allotment
act
did
not
turn
out
to
be
the
great
solution
of
the
indian
problem
which
it
was
hoped
for.
it
raised
hordes
of
problems
in
--
in
turn
and
it
was
a
great
thing
as
hoped
for
the
general
allotment
act
when
it
was
passed.
i
think
it
was
by
and
large
sincere
people
who
try
to
get
it
through
and
not
merely
so
much
the
land
hungry
westerners
that
some
people
say,
but
the
fact
is
that
well
intentioned
or
mere
grab,
it
produced
a
horde
of
problems,
it
can
be
solved
only
as
to
the
individual.
we
represent
here
an
individual
who
has
not
reached
that
point
yet,
he
has
not
received
his
land
in
fee
and
without
incumbrance
as
congress
has
provided
and
i
respectfully
urge
that
that
congressional
policy
must
therefore
be
given
effect.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
on
this
reservation
it
is
rather
high.
this
reservation
has
a
peculiar
history
in
--
pursuant
to
an
opinion
of
this
court
back
in
the
20's.
allotments
had
to
be
granted
to
alien
indians
as
long
as
they
were
fish
eating
indians
on
the
pacific
coast
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
united
states.
there
were
some
indians
allotted
there
who
were
enemies
of
the
quinaielt.
there
were
some
who
--
the
most
of
them
didn't
speak
the
same
language.
their
language
wasn't
in
the
same
family
of
languages.
they
were
just
as
mutually
unintelligible
as
our
english
and
chinese.
those
people
wouldn't
go
to
that
reservation,
they
took
allotments.
there
are
many
of
them
made
a
pretty
fair
adjustment.
from
time
to
time
they
have
been
patented.
some
of
those
on
the
reservation,
some
of
the
quinaielt's,
who
still
live
there,
have
done
very
well
and
have
got
their
patents.
i
understand
that
there
are
many
applications
for
patents
and
fee
pending.
they
have
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
no,
your
honor.
you
can't
farm
that
land,
fishing
in
the
(inaudible).
in
one
case,
the
eastman
case.
i
did
not
cite
it
in
my
brief,
i
only
ran
across
it
the
other
day.
the
united
states
against
eastman,
it
was
decided
in
1941,
its
a
118
f.2d
421
at
page
422.
the
court
said
the
quinaielt
reservation
comprises
about
200,000
acres
of
land
principally
valuable
for
its
timber,
less
than
2%
of
the
area
being
susceptible
to
agricultural
uses.
it's
--
for
one
time
it
was
hoped,
i
have
quoted
some
general
sources
on
that
in
my
brief,
at
one
time
it
was
--
it
was
hoped
that
this
rich
land
that
raises
forest
so
well
would
support
a
large
agriculture.
that
hope
hasn't
worked
out.
in
fact,
stump
farmers
have
been
driven
out
of
the
country
almost
to
a
man.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
they
are
entirely
freed,
sir.
they
--
they
go
ahead
and
pay
their
taxes
on
them.
many
of
them
have
no
interest
in
the
reservation
or
no
remaining
interest
in
it.
they
sell,
they
--
they
become
in
the
indistinguishable
mass
of
property
in
that
area
and
the
individual
indian
in
no
respect
is
on
any
different
basis
tax-wise
or
anything
else
from
anyone
else.
the
indian
problem,
if
i
may
say
very
briefly,
is
not
a
problem
of
civil
liberties.
the
indian
as
a
separate
group
in
this
country
except
for
a
little
--
little
pimple
spots
over
the
country
where
there
are
serious
exceptions
to
be
sure.
the
indian
who
is
as
well
dressed
and
well
mannered
as
the
non-indian
of
his
community
can
ordinarily
move
around
with
him
very
well
and
once
you
--
once
you
do
get
an
indian
acculturated
to
the
point
where
he
can
earn
his
way
and
make
his
living,
he
has
little
of
the
problem
that
besets
the
negro.
there,
the
problems
are
not
comparable.
and
so,
we
find
that
the
federal
policy
which
has
been
adopted
is
on
a
different
basis
too.
the
problem
is
getting
him
acculturated,
not
protecting
him
so
much
from
the
jibes
and
barbs
of
his
fellowmen
but
enabling
him
to
overcome
that
stubborn
insistence
on
his
own
culture
where
they
still
speak
the
norm
language
and
won't
learn
english,
where
they
regard
their
own
ways
as
right
and
ours
as
a
little
foolish
or
a
matter
of
taking
on
heirs,
over
coming
that
so
that
he
can
step
out
into
a
society
which
seems
reasonably
willing
to
greet
him.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
on
this
reservation,
they
go
to
a
reservation
school
until
the
third
grade
i
think
and
then
the
tribe
has
arranged
to
send
them
to
a
public
school.
i
think
the
tribe
pays
for
it.
the
tribe
doesn't
have
much
tribal
money
here
because
almost
all
the
land
is
allotted,
but
they
arrange
to
send
them
to
a
public
school
down
at
moclips,
15
or
20
miles
away.
they
have
their
own
bus
and
take
them
down
there
and
they
--
they
go
to
a
regular
non-indian
school.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
cut
them
off
at
about
the
third
grade,
just
little
fellows
on
that
reservation.
that's
not
something
that's
going
on
for
a
generation,
i
think
that's
something
within
the
last
seven
or
eight
years
that
the
tribe
is
bringing
about
through
its
own
governing
medium
and
then
in
its
own
good
time
and
some
of
these
things
do
seem
to
take
a
good
time.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
yes,
your
honor,
if
they
keep
the
land
or
if
they
don't
sell
it
to
somebody
else,
the
purchaser
pays.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
mr.
justice,
i
both
agree
and
disagree
with
you.
i've
been
associated
with
--
mr.
john
w.
cragun
i
know,
i
both
agree
and
disagree
with
the
view
which
you
mentioned.
i
do
think
that
this
much
is
true,
we
are
learning
and
learned
i
believe
that
the
indian
problem
can't
be
solved
in
some
blind
stroke
that
you
cannot
repeal
a
man's
being
an
indian
or
simply
because
he's
overwhelmed
by
another
culture,
suddenly
having
forget
his
mother
tongue
and
his
own
ways
of
life.
mr.
john
w.
cragun
that's
correct.
if
we
wanted
to
we
couldn't
abolish
them,
it's
had
to
be
gradual
and
i
believe
that
accounts
for
the
policy
of
the
--
the
general
allotment
act.
this
is
taken
into
account,
this
problem
of
taxation
is
taken
into
account
in
the
policy
which
congress
has
had
to
adopt,
has
had
to
draw
up,
to
try
to
solve
this
thing,
congress
hasn't
always
been
i
suppose
as
wise
as
i
feel
i
could
be
on
the
problem
but
on
the
other
hand
they're
doing
the
best
they
can
and
i
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
may
not
second
guess
the
congressional
policy
that
this
court
must
accord
it,
the
purpose
which
congress
has
exhibited
which
i
submit
means
that
the
land
shall
be
delivered
without
diminution
before
the
individual
becomes
taxable.
