this
--
is
it
not
necessary
for
you
to
do
so
in
view
of
the
decision
way
back
to
the
case
of
my
youth,
in
ex
parte
united
states
in
which
this
court
denies
to
the
district
court
the
inherent
power
for
--
placing
people
on
probation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
practice
had
been
enforced
time
out
of
lines
and
there
are
no
facilities
that
prior
to
prosecuting
judges
that
this
court
said,
original
place
of
jurisdiction.
is
that
not
the
probation
act
this
time,
if
you
know?
must
even
to
turn
on
the
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
still
haven't
furnished
with
the
problem
of
construction
by
--
if
your
answer
to
chief
justice
today
relate
what
i
--
my
means
heard
and
i
don't
think
he's
got
any
permission
at
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
so
select
the
statute
even
though
the
statute
doesn't
leave
the
word
which
fits
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
what
they
reflects
to
draw
on
the
construction
of
the
probation
act,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
you
must
have
misunderstood
the
difficulty
of
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
stay
forward.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
story
to
say.
you
mean
as
if
it's
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
rights
you
press,
they
have
--
must
have
come
out
of
that
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
your
account
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
--
judge
collet
didn't
rely
on
some
inherent
power.he
said
he
mustn't
be
barred
from
having
that
view
by
the
probation
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
case
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
see
how
that
argument
had
to
this
kind
of
a
situation.
certainly,
i
don't
see
what
the
argument
in
this
expression,
executive
confines
of
conflict
that
cuts
the
clause
saying
that
they
should
give
separate
sentences
and
the
sentence
number
two
is
to
run
--
is
to
begin
to
run
after
sentence
number
one
has
expired.
you
haven't
entered
upon
that
sentence.
in
other
words,
i
should
like
to
tell
you
before
you
sit
down,
why
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
question
of
reading?
this
statute
in
the
matter
of
reading
english
or
whether
they
have
entered
upon
the
constructions,
one's
attitude
towards
the
probation
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
--
i
can
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
think
--
looking
for
the
intention
of
congress
and
looking
for
the
black
cat,
and
is
all
through
when
the
black
cat
isn't
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
more
on
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
intention
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
did
that
(voice
overlap)
that
contemplate
in
this
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
in
the
legislative
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we
haven't
got
anything
from
congress
except
--
except
this
act
was
--
the
duty
weave
this
act
in
conformity
or
in
harmony
with
other
acts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
but
i
don't
think
1948
made
any
changed.
i'm
talking
about
the
construction
referring
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
will
be
entirely
deciding
the
1948,
of
this
act,
i
get
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
on
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
on
this
case.
you
can't
give
probation
for
the
sentence
unless
the
government
began
giving
probation
for
the
sentence
to
preserve
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
is
different
from
anything
we've
go
for
that.
i'm
not
stating
you're
not
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
part
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
practice
of
probation
in
the
federal
government
until
that
part
of
united
states
came
along
as
longer
than
the
states
had,
mostly.
because
of
our
statute,
the
federal
courts
up
to
the
(inaudible)
case,
have
been
exercising
this
function
as
a
matter
of
inherent
or
prior
to
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
decades.
the
first
in
56
years
and
this
court
said,
something
that
has
been
in
practice
in
the
courts
for
56
years
but
beyond
their
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
rejected
--
he
surrendered
under
a
relatively
used,
the
number
of
criminal
prosections
in
the
federal
courts
as
very
(inaudible)
as
compared
to
the
long
--
the
whole
range
of
criminal
prosecutions
in
the
states,
that's
also.
justice
felix
frankfurter
conclusive
there
is
that
for
perhaps
50
years
prior
to
the
part
of
united
states,
probation
was
exercised
by
federal
judges
in
severe
crimes
as
a
matter
of
inherent
jurisdiction,
deemed
to
be
part
of
the
function
of
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
along
came
--
then
along
came
at
the
part
of
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you
i
can
feel
it
under
the
shock.
then
came
the
statutes
that
we're
now
construing.
i
throw
out
the
1948
amendment.
i
don't
think
that
attaches.
i
do
say
that
they
have
a
new
question
here
that
is
not
to
be
answered
by
any
of
the
prior
decisions
or
by
the
language
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
think
a
serious
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
lindsay,
i
have
to
have
a
prejudice
arising
--
arising
there.
if
i
may
say
so,
this
argument
of
yours
is
full
of
flaw.
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
judge
has
the
discretion
if
a
man
is
convicted
on
five
counts
or
five
indictments
or
probably.
or
we
can
--
may
give
on
each
count,
on
each
sentence
or
each
indictment
five
years.
he
may
do
that
concurrently
or
he
may
do
that
consecutively
or
he
may
give
a
maximum
or
the
intervening
theory.
well,
what
kind
of
an
argument
is
this
that
this
would
cut
into
that
power
if
you
have
that
power.
they
could
have
exercised
it
before
the
sentence
began
and
the
question
is
whether
the
bars
it,
not
whether
he
had
with
the
power
which
we
say
here,
of
course,
he
had.
where
is
that
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
question
--
all
i'm
saying
is,
it
isn't
the
question,
of
phrasing.
it's
a
question
of
the
exercise
of
discretion.
it's
a
question
of
phrasing.
it's
a
question
of
a
determination
by
him
whether
the
sentence
and
when
he
gets
to
require
him,
he
could
have
five
more
years
or
whether
he
should
have
five
years
in
serving.
that
is
the
phrasing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
go
on
the
--
i
don't
go
on
the
compulsions
of
language
and
i
have
to
change
it.
i'm
saying
that
a
judge
may
decide
at
the
ultimate
question.
but
although
a
fellow
has
committed
five
hundred
executions,
he
serviced
only
for
one
term,
if
it
was.
all
he
may
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
and
then
having
thought
some
more
about
finality,
he
may
say
or
he's
dead
wrong
in
having
him
for
the
25
year-sentence.
i
was
dead
wrong.
this
fellow,
i
think,
begun
to
serve
his
second
five
years
and
i
will
now
take
think
it
has
to
be
done
as
a
matter
of
(inaudible)
to
serve
that
sentence.
i
will
now
say,
i
will
give
him
probation
which
i
could
have
done
ab
initio.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
argument
is
reducing.
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
you
merely
ban
the
words
around,
we
don't
really
get
to
the
heart
of
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
with
you
but
--
but
that
all
goes
back
to
the
decision
that's
hooked
in
the
murray
case,
that
once
you
begin
the
sentence,
one
day
is
too
late.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
courts
are
good
instrument
for
imposing
sentence
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
