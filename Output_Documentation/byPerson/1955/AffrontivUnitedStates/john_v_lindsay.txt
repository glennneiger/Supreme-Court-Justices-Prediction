mr.
john
v.
lindsay
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
court
decided
the
(inaudible)
case
in
1916,
which
i
believe
is
the
case
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
referring
to
in
volume
242,
it
made
two
points
clear.
first
of
all,
that
there
was
no
power
that
common
law
--
to
suspend
a
sentence
absolutely
or
permanently.
it
did
not
exist.
and
secondly,
that
the
federal
courts
had
no
such
power,
despite
the
fact
at
which
existed
in
some
federal
and
in
some
state
courts
at
the
time.
"recourse
must
be
had
to
the
congress,"
said
this
court,
whose
power
in
this
field
in
the
language
of
the
court
is
adequately
complete.
the
result
of
the
(inaudible)
case
was
continued
and
reinforced
agitation
on
the
part
of
the
exponents
of
probation
were
some
sort
of
legislation
in
this
field,
and
it
resulted
in
1925
in
the
passage
of
the
probation
act
of
that
year.
and
that
act
provided
that
after
conviction
or
plea
of
guilty
or
nolo
contendere,
the
court,
district
court,
may
suspend
sentence
and
grant
probation
that
the
court
may
suspend
at
the
imposition
or
the
execution
of
sentence
and
grant
probation.
and
of
course
that
statute,
spoken
terms
of
a
general
or
single
sentence,
there
was
no
differentiation
made
in
the
case
of
a
sentence
involving
multiple
counts
or
indictments.
the
chief
difficulty
that
the
federal
courts
had
with
the
application
of
that
statute
was
the
question
which
was
answered
by
this
court
in
murray
in
volume
275,
1928.
there
are
other
subsidiary
difficulties
which
the
federal
courts
had
but
they're
not
of
immediate
concern
to
this
problem
today.
and
if
murray
case
held
--
this
court
there
held
that
the
district
court
loses
power
to
suspend
sentence
once
the
defendant
has
entered
upon
the
service
of
his
sentence.
and
in
the
language
of
this
court,
it
was
stated
that
when
any
part
of
the
sentence
has
been
served,
the
district
court
loses
power
to
entertain
a
motion
to
put
it
to
suspend
sentence
and
grant
probation.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
it
was
not,
mr.
justice.
the
murray
case
had
came
up
--
it
was
two
cases
as
counsel
has
pointed
out.
one
concerned
a
--
a
sentence
for
14
years
and
9
months
and
the
application
for
probation
was
presented
to
the
district
court
four
years
later.
it
actually
was
a
case
involving
consecutive
terms,
but
it
was
not
argued,
presented,
or
decided
by
this
court
on
that
basis.
the
cook
case
incidentally,
which
was
the
companion
case
decided
by
the
court
at
the
same
time,
involved
a
sentence
for
three
months.
and
one
day
after
the
incarceration,
the
prisoner
came
to
the
court
and
asked
to
have
his
sentence
suspended
and
probation
granted
and
the
court,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
granted
the
motion.
but
the
basis
for
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
murray
case,
which
again
was
concerned
with
the
1925
statute
prior
to
the
1948
revision
of
the
criminal
code
is
important.
three
points
stand
out.
"one,"
said
to
this
court,
“the
reason
for
the
probation
act
was
this,
was
to
grant
to
young
and
new
first
violators
of
the
law
a
chance
to
reform
and
to
avoid
the
contaminating
influence
of
association
with
hardened
criminals
at
the
time
of
the
sentence."
avoidance
at
the
time
of
the
sentence
was
the
key
that
was
expounded
to
the
congress
by
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
at
the
time
it
was
passed.
and
indeed,
that
was
the
background
against
which
the
legislation
was
passed.
"secondly,"
said
this
court,
“congress
could
not
have
intended
in
passing
this
legislation
to
require
the
district
court,
days,
months,
indeed
years
later
to
entertain
applications
for
suspension
of
sentence
and
probation
after
the
prisoner
has
been
turned
over
to
the
attorney
general
for
custody
and
has
commenced
his
--
his
service.”
thirdly,
congress
and
this
is
related
to
point
number
2.
"thirdly,"
said
the
court
in
the
murray
case,
“congress
could
not
have
intended
an
overlap
with
the
resulting
conflicts
that
would
occur
between
the
operation
of
the
probation
of
the
parole
statute
which
even
then
provided
for
parole
after
one-third
of
the
aggregate
sentence
and
the
application
of
the
good
time
statutes
--
the
credit
for
good
conduct,
which
is
given
to
prisoners.
on
the
one
hand,
and
indeed
of
course,
the
power
of
clemency
which
is
always
available,
the
presidential
power
of
clemency,
those
on
the
one
hand
and
the
judiciary
on
the
other
hand.
now,
the
government
submits
that
the
reason
and
logic
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
murray
case
is
equally
--
applies
with
equal
force
and
vigor
under
the
1948
revision
to
the
probation
act
of
the
code
of
--
and
indeed
to
the
instant
case.
well,
the
1948
revision
did
only
two
things
to
the
1925
act.
first,
it
changed
the
initial
language
that
after
conviction
or
plea
of
guilty
or
nolo
contendere,
the
district
court
may
suspend
sentence
and
grant
a
probation,
it
changed
that
to
read
upon
entering
judgment
of
conviction.
now,
the
reviser's
notes
do
not
indicate
that
there
was
any
substantive
change
intended.
the
reviser's
notes
only
indicate
this,
that
the
change
in
language
was
made
because
the
excess
language
was
dropped
as
unnecessary,
said
the
revisers.
now,
it
is
submitted
that
in
the
absence
of
substantive
change,
that
the
reviser's
and
the
congress
must
have
known
the
construction
that
have
been
placed
upon
the
probation
act
by
this
court
in
the
murray
case.
and
indeed,
if
anything,
the
use
of
the
word
upon
indicates
a
more
stringent
application
of
the
use
of
probation
than
had
been
prior
to
--
than
have
been
the
case
before
this.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
do,
mr.
justice.
now,
the
second
change
that
was
made
in
the
--
by
the
revisers
were
these.
that
an
additional
sentence
was
inserted
which
ran
as
follows.
that
probation
may
be
limited
to
one
or
--
or
more
counts
or
indictments
but
that
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
limitation,
it
shall
extend
to
the
entire
sentence,
singular,
and
judgment.
now,
the
reviser's
notes
indicate,
in
that
respect
only
this.
that
that
change
or
addition
reflected
the
existing
practice
in
the
federal
courts
which
was
true.
this
court,
in
two
decisions
in
volumes
302
and
303
had
approved
the
practice
of
--
at
the
time
of
judgment,
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
of
sentencing,
of
sending
a
man
to
jail
on
some
counts
and
granting
probation
--
suspending
sentence
and
granting
probation
on
other
counts
and
the
same
with
respect
to
multiple
indictments
tried
together.
so
those
two
questions
were
settled.
and
what
the
reviser's
notes
indicated
was
correct
that
existing
practice
was
being
confirmed.
now,
judge
sanborn
in
the
phillips
case
--
the
phillips
case
and
the
affronti
case
and
instant
case
come
up
from
the
eighth
circuit
in
which
the
government
argues
is
the
correct
rule
of
law.
and
i
should
add
too
that
the
eighth
circuit
is
supported
by
the
very
articulate
opinion
of
judge
dobie
in
the
fourth
circuit.
judges
parker
and
soper
going
along
with
him
which
in
turn
is
based
in
large
part
on
the
excellent
opinion
of
judge
chestnut
in
the
court
below.
those
two
circuits
argue
this
way
in
substance.
that
the
probation
act
is
not
an
isolated
act.
that
at
the
time
of
the
revision
of
the
code,
the
revisers
intended
a
comprehensive
and
orderly
revision
of
all
of
the
statutes
relating
to
crime
and
criminal
procedure.
and
then
it
could
not
have
been
the
intent
of
the
congress
at
that
time
to
upset
the
construction
that
have
been
placed
on
the
1925
act
by
this
code
which
clearly
enunciated
the
desirability
of
having
a
division
between
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
and
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
when
it
comes
to
the
business
of
modification
or
reorganizing
a
sentence
of
a
man
who
is
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
i
think
both.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
both,
mr.
justice.
first
of
all,
if
you
read
the
statute,
the
statute
says
that
the
executed
--
the
imposition
or
the
execution
may
be
suspended
with
respect
to
one
or
more
counts
or
indictments.
but
then
in
the
absence
of
any
expressed
limitation,
shall
extend
to
the
entire
sentence
in
the
singular.
the
statute
nowhere
talks
in
terms
of
sentences.
it
talks
in
terms
of
counts
or
indictments.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
possibly
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
possibly
so.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
possibly
so.
i
think
in
the
absence
of
legislative
history,
it's
--
it's
probably
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
permissible
to
turn
to
the
statute.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
believe
that
they
did
contemplate
this
kind
of
a
situation
and
i'll
give
you
further
reasons
for
that.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
not
in
legislative
history.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'll
say
that
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and
you
have
this
too,
mr.
justice,
which
is
to
say,
that
--
that
if
substantive
change
had
been
intended
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
the
reviser's
notes
would
have
--
would
--
would
have
stated
as
much.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
apart
from
the
legislative
history
that
i've
given
you
as
to
the
desirability
of
probation
at
the
time
of
the
sentence,
we
don't
get
any
help.
now
there,
that's
the
key,
really.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
the
--
the
practice
of
all
of
the
sates
with
the
exception
of
one,
state
of
tennessee,
have
probation
statutes.
even
tennessee
has
one
with
respect
to
juveniles.
there
is
a
great
difference
in
their
application
and
i
can't
--
i
can't
answer
your
question
absolutely
directly.
i
can't
tell
you
that
in
new
york,
the
statute
is
much
the
same
as
the
federal
statute.
and
although
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
cases
directly
on
this
point
here
from
a
reading
of
the
statute,
which
terms
--
which
speaks
in
terms
of
commencement
of
imprisonment,
which
is
the
cutoff
date,
the
same
result
would
follow
unless
he
would
doubt
the
theory
that
is
advanced
by
the
petitioner
here
that
you've
got
entirely
separate
and
distinct
sentences
when
you
have
a
multiple
count
sentence.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
do
not.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
do
not.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
do
not.
i
do
know
that
in
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
--
that
is
the
--
the
entire
theory
of
the
petitioner's
argument.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'll
concede
that.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
this
court
has
had.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'll
concede
that.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
correct.
i
--
i
think
that
the
state
of
massachusetts
too
had
been
following
a
--
a
rule
of
laying
the
case
on
the
file
as
they
call
it,
which
has
amounted
to
suspension.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
think
that
that
may
well
be
so.
i
have
in
the
--
i
--
i
do
know
that
in
the
state
of
california
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
power
in
the
part
of
the
judge
to
--
to
later
use,
to
reach
back
and
make
an
adjustment
in
the
sentence.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
don't
argue
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
that
is
right.
and
the
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
which
was
a
great
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
shock
to
people
when
it
came.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well
now,
let
me
give
you
some
additional
reasons
as
to
why
i
think
that
not
only
that
the
murray
case
controls
on
this
new
statute
but
as
to
why
it
should
control.
and
i
think
that
was
the
second
half
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
--
the
second
half
of
the
original
question.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
in
this
phillips
case,
which
is
really
the
key
leading
decision,
parole
had
already
been
denied
the
applicant
at
the
time
that
the
trial
judge
turned
down
his
application
for
suspension
and
probation.
in
the
mann
case
which
was
the
lower
court
decision
of
judge
chestnut,
which
was
subsequently
approved
by
judge
dobie
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
there
had
been
three
prior
applications
to
the
district
court.
and
in
both
cases,
the
court
stress
this.
that
it
is
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
exclusively
that
has
supervision
of
the
prisoner,
that
has
the
skills
at
its
command
to
measure
the
extent
of
rehabilitation.
and
then
every
single
one
of
the
cases
where
an
application
has
been
brought
to
the
district
court,
the
affidavits
of
the
prisoner
and
the
argument
of
counsel
has
always
been
this.
that
the
prisoner,
while
in
prison,
while
in
custody,
has
--
has
shown
such
a
remarkable
degree
of
improvement
and
rehabilitation
or
is
otherwise
been
of
service
to
the
federal
government
in
other
respects
that
he
is
now
deserving
and
that
the
original
sentence
was
too
harsh
or
something
else.
and
i
--
i
have
--
submit
that
the
chief
difficulty
with
the
--
the
chief
difficulty
in
the
practical
basis
where
the
argument
that
is
advanced
by
the
petitioner
that
you
can
take
a
consecutive
count
sentence
and
divide
it
up
into
separate
sentences,
separate
terms
is
this.
is
that
therefore,
in
later
years,
the
exercise
of
the
power
of
suspension
and
probation
will
depend
entirely
on
the
phraseology
used
by
the
trial
judge
in
sentencing
the
man.
it's
conceded
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
--
in
--
in
his
brief,
i
think,
that
the
trial
judge
and
indeed
this
is
the
argument
that
was
used
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
fourth
circuit
as
well.
that
the
trial
judge
can
sentence
any
one
of
a
number
ways.
he
can
take
the
entire
amount
permissible.
take
the
series
of
counts
and
add
them
all
together
and
then
put
it
in
the
judgment
in
terms
of
the
general
sentence
or
something
less
than
that.
or
he
can
divide
it
up
into
terms,
into
counts
and
sentence
into
a
separate
terms
and
--
and
order
some
to
run
concurrently
and
some
to
be
consecutive
or
the
whole
bunch
can
be
concurrent.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
why
should
--
why
should
the
district
judge
at
20
years,
15
years
later
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'll
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice,
but
my
argument
is
this.
that
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
use
the
artificial
device
of
saying
that
a
sentence,
which
is
no
less
final
because
it
is
--
it
--
it
has
included
in
it
multiple
counts
or
indictments,
is
no
less
final.
it's
artificial
to
say
that
you
--
years
later,
can
divide
it
up
into
separate
counts
and
separate
sentences,
in
colet's
separate
sentences.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
25
years.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
no.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
well,
i
think
--
i
--
i
think
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
that
my
--
my
argument
is
a
perfectly
permissible
one
on
this
score.
and
i
--
i'm
not
sure
--
i
think
you
understand
--
i'm
not
sure
that
you
understand
that
if
a
general
sentence
for
the
multi
--
for
maximum
amount
is
imposed,
there
is
no
power
at
a
later
date
to
make
any
adjustment.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i
hardly
agreed
and
that's
why
i
say
that
the
real
answer
to
this
case
here
is
that
the
underlying
theory
and
reasons
of
this
court
in
the
murray
case
is
the
chief
difficulty
with
the
proposition
that
is
put
to
this
court
by
the
petitioner
because
the
same
reasons
apply.
now,
i
--
i
certainly
will
not
argue
at
all
that
there
are
not
weaknesses
in
the
present
system,
and
that
it
--
it
would
not
be
desirable
that
at
future
date
in
a
particular
sentence
to
have
machinery
that
would
give
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
the
chance
to
take
another
look
at
it
particularly
where
a
parole
of
the
man
is
not
eligible
for
parole.
but
i
submit
that
if
the
--
if
the
proposition
which
is
argued
to
this
court
by
the
petitioner
and
this
case
is
adopted,
it
would
create
a
great
deal
of
more
mischief
than
has
ever
been
--
that
has
been
the
result
in
particular
cases
where
there
had
been
hardship
of
--
in
sentences
or
where
a
man
truly
has
made
remarkable
adjustment
and
there
should
be
an
adjustment
or
reorganization
of
his
sentence
but
the
courts
are
not
the
bodies
to
do
it.
it
requires
legislation
if
it's
to
be
done
and
it's
a
power
which
should
be
exercised
by
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
not
the
judiciary.
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
i'm
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'm
not
going
to
quarrel
with
you
on
that
point
of
--
of
that
there's
a
--
mr.
john
v.
lindsay
and
i
think
you
would
find
a
lot
of
support
in
the
executive
branch
of
government
for
that
--
for
that
argument.
indeed,
i
think
that
--
that
among
the
leading
experts
of
the
probation
system
of
course
is
the
director
of
administrative
office
of
the
courts.
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
permissible
that
--
it's
perfectly
proper
to
argue
because
he
has
written
about
it
in
--
in
two
leading
--
in
two
leading
articles,
one,
in
the
25th
anniversary
issue
of
federal
probation
published
in
1950
and
again,
in
volume
37,
i
think,
of
virginia
law
review
has
argued
very
persuasively
that
probation
is
not
the
machinery
to
use
--
to
tamper
with
a
sentence
after
a
man
has
been
turned
over
to
the
attorney
general.
indeed,
he
argues
this
way,
that
he
divorce
the
practice
which
was
approved
in
this
court
in
fred
versus
kelly
&
kossman
of
allowing
a
split
sentence,
jailed
on
some
counts,
probation
on
other
counts
and
which
was
adopted
in
1948
by
the
congress,
although
they
intended
no
substitute
change.
he
deploys
that
practice
because
it
said
that
it
goes
against
the
original
purpose
of
probation
which
was
to
pluck
the
bland
--
brand
from
the
burning
as
this
court
said
in
the
murray
case,
stop
him
from
going
to
prison.
and
he
argues
further
that
the
transition
between
jail
and
public
life
can
only
and
best
be
done
the
machinery
or
parole
and
not
by
the
exercise
of
the
probation
statute.
i
think
that
it's
a
--
it's
perfectly
proper
to
--
to
argue
this
two
that
--
that
one
of
the
greatest
needs
in
the
prison
administration
is
for
certainty
of
sentence.
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
will
tell
you
that,
although
he
is
the
first
one
to
admit
that
there
are
hardships
under
the
present
cacophony
of
sentencing
in
--
in
this
government.
he
will
argue
that
certainly,
it's
necessary
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
management
of
the
prisons
so
that
they
can
program
the
man,
and
certainty
is
important
from
the
program
of
the
prisoner
also
so
that
he
can
assist
in
that
program.
now,
i
would
agree
that
those
are
--
are
additional
arguments
and
they
don't
--
they
don't
strike
at
the
construction
of
the
statute
but
you
go
right
back
to
the
murray
case
when
you
are
worrying
about
how
to
construe
this
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
find
the
answer
in
the
decision
of
that
court
--
of
this
court
in
the
murray
case.
for
these
reasons,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
and
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
