mr.
harry
f.
murphy
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
eighth
circuit.
there
is
one
question
to
be
decided
in
this
case,
decided
carefully.
upon
sentence
to
consecutive
sentences
or
terms
by
a
district
court.
the
defending
pattern
started
the
service
of
a
first
sentence.
thus,
the
district
court
thereafter
have
jurisdiction
to
suspend
the
execution
of
the
remaining
sentences
and
place
the
defendant
on
probation.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
consecutive
sentences.
in
this
case,
the
defendant,
affronti,
was
indicted
in
1932
by
a
grand
jury
in
the
western
district
of
missouri.
charged
in
an
indictment
in
ten
counts
with
the
illegal
sale
of
narcotics.
i've
mentioned
the
dates
because
they,
if
not
of
importance,
will
be
of
interest.
in
1944,
the
defendant
was
brought
in
to
the
district
court
at
kansas
city
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
from
the
missouri
state
penitentiary
where
he
was
in
the
service
of
a
sentence
for
second
degree
murder.
the
district
judge
on
that
--
at
that
time
was
judge
caskie
collet.
upon
trial
before
a
jury,
the
defendant
was
acquitted
on
the
first
of
the
ten
counts,
found
guilty
on
the
remaining
nine
and
sentence
was
pronounced
disclosed.
on
all
nine
counts
of
the
--
the
indictment,
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
five
years
which
was
the
maximum
sentence
under
the
statute
that
had
been
violated.sentences
two,
three,
four
and
five
were
pronounced
to
run
consecutively.
the
remaining
five
sentences,
sentence
was
suspended
and
the
defendant
was
to
be
placed
upon
probation
for
a
period
of
25
years.
the
judgment
further
provided
that
the
sentence
on
the
second
count
would
be
to
commence
at
the
time
he
was
released
from
authorities
in
missouri
state.
in
1949,
after
his
release
from
the
missouri
state
penitentiary,
he
was
delivered
to
the
united
states
marshal
for
the
service
of
the
first
five
years
of
the
second
count
of
the
indictment.
in
1953,
four
years
later

harry
f.
murphy

years.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
twenty
years,
four
--
four
counts
of
five
years.
but
the
computation
is
a
question
whether
he
had
yet
started
the
service
as
--
as
second
of
his
third
five
years,
but
in
1943,
at
which
time
judge
duncan
had
succeeded
judge
collet
as
the
district
judge
in
that
division,
judge
collet
having
been
promoted
to
the
eighth
circuit
bench.
a
motion
was
filed
on
his
behalf
requesting
that
the
remaining
sentences
yet
to
be
served,
either
the
third,
fourth,
and
fifth
counts
or
the
fourth
and
fifth,
that
the
execution
of
the
sentence
as
yet
to
be
served
be
suspended
and
be
placed
on
probation.
now,
in
--
two
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
motion
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
in
the
district
court,
judge
reeves,
another
division
of
the
western
district
had
ruled
in
the
case
of
phillips
versus
the
united
states
for
the
facts
as
far
as
sentences
are
concerned,
were
identical
with
the
facts
in
this
case,
and
that
phillips,
the
defendant,
was
in
the
service
of
the
first
of
three
consecutive
terms.
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
entertain
such
a
motion
as
the
term
had
passed
and
the
60
days
had
--
had
passed
when
he
had
--
after
he
had
been
first
sentenced.
pending
the
appeal
of
the
phillips
case,
judge
duncan
held
in
abeyance
of
ruling
on
the
affronti
case.
on
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
the
phillips
decision
was
affirmed.
on
that
bench,
sitting
as
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals,
was
judge
collet.
and
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
he
held
that
a
district
court
in
his
opinion
had
a
right
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
sentences
yet
to
be
served.
after
the
phillips
case
was
passed,
the
time
had
passed,
no
application
was
made
to
this
court
for
certiorari,
although
the
court
of
appeals
had
recommended
that
he'd
be
permitted
to
apply
without
the
payment
of
cost.
the
court
--
appeal
was
taken
in
the
affronti
case
to
the
same
court.
and
again,
on
that
same
court,
judge
collet
sat
as
a
member
of
the
court
of
appeals.
following
the
phillips
case,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
phillips
case.
judge

consistently
again
dissenting.
again,
that
court
recommended
that
affronti
be
permitted
to
apply
for
certiorari
without
the
payment
of
costs.
the
basis
of
the
ruling
in
the
phillips
case,
opinion
by
judge
reeves,
the
district
judge
and
followed
up
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
an
early
case
passed
on
this
court
in
1948
by
the
opinion
written
by
chief
justice
taft,
murray
versus
the
united
states,
in
which
the
facts
briefly
were
these.
a
man
by
the
name
of
cook
had
been
sentenced
in
a
texas
district
court
for
a
total
of
14
years
and
some
months.
a
man
in
nebraska
had
been
sentenced
to
three
months
on
six
counts
to
run
concurrently.
after
the
defendant
murray
had
served
one
day
of
his
three-month
sentence,
the
sentencing
judge
made
an
order
suspending
the
execution
of
that
sentence
and
placed
murray
on
probation
for
the
balance
of
his
term.
shortly
thereafter
in
texas,
the
district
court
in
the
cook
case,
after
the
service
of
sentence
had
been
began
by
cook
for
several
years
at
least,
on
the
one
sentence
according
to
the
opinion,
the
court
in
that
case
ordered
the
defendant
placed
on
probation,
suspended
the
execution
of
the
remaining
sentence
then
being
served.
upon
appeal
by
the
government
to
this
court,
certiorari
from
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
fifth,
i
believe
it
was,
the
opinion
held
that
having
once
--
once
started
the
service
of
the
sentence,
the
district
court
was
without
power
to
place
the
defendant
on
probation
suspend
the
execution
of
that
sentence.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
question
of
consecutive
sentences,
although
perhaps,
in
the
cook
case,
the
sentence
actually
was
of
sentences
running
consecutively.
but
that
doesn't
appear
to
have
been
of
any
moment
at
least
to
the
court
in
the
murray
opinion.
that
created,
if
not
confusion,
at
least
some
difference
of
opinions
in
the
different
circuits
as
to
the
right
of
the
sentencing
judge
under
the
probation
act
to
sentence
and
suspend
at
the
same
time.
some
courts
holding
that
having
sentenced
on
one
count,
the
court
could
not,
on
remaining
counts,
place
the
--
the
defendant
on
probation.
that
had
been
followed
or
there
was
some
confusion
in
the
various
circuits
or
the
districts,
shall
we
say,
until
the
kirk
case
went
up
to
the
ninth
circuit
from
california.
in
that
case,
three
defendants
had
been
sentenced
on
consecutive
terms,
the
first
two
of
which
were
seventeen
and
a
half
years
and
the
third
for
two
years.
during
the
service
of
the
first
sentence
by
one
of
the
defendants,
the
court
in
that
case
ordered
the
execution,
suspend
the
remaining
sentences,
and
at
the
completion
of
the
service
of
that
first
sentence,
the
defendant
was
to
be
placed
on
probation.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
well
the
--
the
probation
statute,
i
think,
which
the
section
--
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
3651
--
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
well,
frankly,
i'm
relying
upon
the
language
in
the
kirk
case
which
held
--
holds
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
suspend
the
execution
of
sentences
yet
not
served.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
that
--
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
well,
that's
a
little
bit
puzzling
to
me
at
this
time.
the
statute
hasn't
been
--
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
it
hasn't
been
construed,
the
language
of
the
former
statute
was
changed
formerly
reading
after
a
conviction
and
to
comply
with
the
criminal
--
as
--
as
part
of
the
criminal
code
in
the
criminal
statutes,
the
language
was
changed
to
"upon
service
or
the
entering
of
a
judgment
conviction."
so,
the
conflict
before
this
court
is
between
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
kirk
case,
was
held
on
appeal
that
the
district
court
did
have
power,
had
been
discretionary,
of
course,
to
suspend
the
execution
of
sentence
yes
--
yet
not
served.
and
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
which
held
before,
had
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
that's
the
ex
--
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
well,
the
statute,
which
was
involved
in
the
--
in
the
murray
case
had
been
enacted
as
i
recall
in
1925.
this
was
a
basis
for
the
ruling
there
that
the
court
could
grant
probation,
which
followed
some
eight
years
after,
i
think
it's
ex
parte
lange
case
that
you
have
reference
to
and
down
to
1918.
in
any
event,
the
statute
was
passed
in
1925,
which
permitted
district
courts
to
suspend
the
execution
and
place
defendants
on
probation.
the
--
the
trouble
here
is
that
the
question
of
the
definition
of
a
final
judgment
or
a
single
judgment
are
separate
sentences
merged
into
one
separate
judgment
so
that
the
district
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
well,
the
--
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
well,
of
course,
we
have
here
in
this
particular
case
of
conflict
where
courts
of
appeals
have
decided
differently
and
--
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
well,
i
--
i
understand
that
you're
asking
what
statutory
provisions
we
have
here
which
give
the
district
court
the
right
to
suspend
the
execution.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
and
i
state
there's
no
definition
to
this
particular
statute
which
says
the
court
does
or
does
not
have
that
right.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
i'd
say
there
is
some
confusion,
exists
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
without
a
definition
from
this
court.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
that
is
correct.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
absent
the
statute,
the
court
has
been
held
to
have
no
power
to
place
--
suspend
a
non-probation.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
that
is
right.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
when
does
the
judgment
comes
effective,
that's
the
thing
that
we
haven't
forced
here.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
upon,
immediately?
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
that's
right.
well,
that's
the
--
that's
the
disturbing
thing
about
the
whole
thing
here,
is
that
we
have
a
man
who
is
serving
four
sentences,
totaling
20
years.
judge
collet
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
both
appeals,
that
we're
bringing
in
this
case
what
he
had
said
in
the
opinion
in
the
phillips
case.
held
that
the
sentencing
judge
in
his
opinion
had
the
power
at
any
time
for
the
commencement
of
the
service
of
any
of
the
remaining
sentences
to
come
in
and
set
that
aside
by
putting
the
--
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
that
is
right.
well,
we
have,
for
consideration,
just
the
--
as
i
--
as
i
view
it,
the
three
cases,
the
early
case
of
murray
against
the
united
states,
the
phillips
case
in
this
circuit
and
the
kirk
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
whereas
in
the
court's
definition
of
the
statute,
if
the
court
may
retain
jurisdiction
at
any
time
for
any
of
the
remaining
sentences
served
in,
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
suspend
the
execution
of
the
sentence
of
those
remaining
--
the
balance
of
those
sentences.
well,
that's
it.
mr.
harry
f.
murphy
if
the
court
please,
i
see
that
i
can
add
nothing
to
what
i
have
said
previously.
i
think
the
decision
of
this
court
will
go
a
long
ways
towards
turning
up
a
misunderstanding
that
exist
throughout
the
country
because
we
have
district
courts
and
unreported
cases
which
we
know
about
or
not
daily
but
frequently
suspending
the
execution
of
sentences
yet
to
be
served
where
the
defendants
is
confined.
we
have
the
conflict
between
the
ninth
and
tenth
circuits
on
the
one
hand
and
the
eighth
and
fourth
on
the
other.
so
with
regard
to
the
outcome
of
the
--
the
decision
of
this
court,
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
--
future
administration
of
judgments.
