chief

mr.
murphy,
what
statutory
language
do
you
rely
upon
for
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
3651?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
language
there
do
you
rely
on
to
support
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
beyond
any
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
do
--
do
they
get
that
power
through
a
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
to
me
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
rely
on
any
statutory
language
saying
that
the
court
has
the
authority
to
grant
probation
under
these
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lindsay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
one
view
or
the
other.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lindsay,
many
of
the
states
of
the
union
have
had
a
longer
experience
with
probation
than
the
federal
government
itself.
i
wonder,
as
far
as
you
know
if
there
is
anything
in
the
statutes
or
the
general
practice
in
the
various
states
on
probation
that
would
indicate
the
probation
system
is
in
spirit
different
from
anything
you
would
have
indicated
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
what
i
--
what
i
was
getting
at,
do
you
know
of
any
--
any
states,
i
do
not,
where
a
judge
can
sentence
a
man
to
prison
then
at
the
end
of
five
years
or
so,
give
him
probation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
may
be
--
i
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you
would
still
find,
mr.
lindsay,
though
that
many
states
have
had
--
it
may
deal
more
experience
with
probation
on
the
federal
government.

justice
earl
warren

murphy.
