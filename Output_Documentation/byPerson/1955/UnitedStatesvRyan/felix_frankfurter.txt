mr.
davis,
is
there
any
particular
reason
why
in
(inaudible)
when
they
define
a
person
they
think
of
legal
representative.
is
that
(inaudible)
in
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
strange.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
it
comes
to
defining
it,
legally
it's
left
out
and
as
you
referred
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
there's
no
legal
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
do
not
--
if
you
do
not
so
limit
it,
how
far
do
you
extend
it,
to
what
do
you
extend
it?
i
ask
that
question
before
you
sit
down
with
the
jury
because
of
the
fifth
and
judge
hand's
dissent.
i
can
see
no
reason
to
deny
what
you
mean
from
the
actual
meaning
of
representative
which
would
cover
any
official
or
at
any
rate
the
president
of
the
union.
in
your
overtime,
you
deal
with
--
with
the
content
you
give
to
representative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
leave
it
at
large.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
agree
that
you
must
give
--
you
can't
say,
"well,
anyhow
the
president
is
here,
can
we
stop
there?"
we
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
in
relation
to
collective
bargaining
or
negotiation.you
wouldn't
restrict
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
other
way
around
that
the
context
shows
what
representative
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
what
you
said
that
it's
always
qualified.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
definition,
mr.
waldman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it
that
is
on
that
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
could
it
just
--
just
leave
the
house?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
and
that
came
back
to
the
house
to
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
covers
both
the
