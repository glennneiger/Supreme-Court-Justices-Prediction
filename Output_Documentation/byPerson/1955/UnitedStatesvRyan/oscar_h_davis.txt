mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
after
conviction
in
the
district
court
and
reversal
in
--
in
that
court
of
appeals.
the
single
question
which
the
government,
as
the
petitioner,
presents
is
one
of
statutory
construction
of
a
section
of
the
taft-hartley
law,
the
labor
management
relations
act.
it
involved
section
302
of
that
statute
and
the
--
and
that
particular
section
forbids
the
receipt
by
any
representative
of
any
employees
of
an
industry
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
affecting
interstate
commerce
of
any
payment
from
the
employer
of
such
employees.
and
the
question
here
is
when
--
when
congress
used
the
phrase
in
that
section,
"any
representatives
of
any
employees,"
it
meant
to
cover
the
president
of
the
union
which
was
the
collective
bargaining
agent
for
the
employees
in
that
industry
in
that
locality,
who
was
also
the
negotiator
for
the
union
of
its
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
whether
congress
restricted
its
coverage
to
the
union
itself,
not
to
any
officials
of
the
union
or
any
negotiators
for
the
union.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
complicated.
they
are
these.
the
respondent
ryan
was
in
the
relevant
years,
which
were
1950
and
1951,
the
president
of
the
international
longshoremen's
association,
which
is
a
well-known
labor
union
of
stevedores
and
stevedoring
employees
and
longshoremen.
he
was
the
president
of
the
union
and
also
of
its
atlantic
coast
district.
he
was
one
of
the
union's
negotiators
of
its
collective
bargaining
agreements
in
the
port
of
new
york
and
he
was
assignor
of
those
agreements.
the
union
was
the
collective
bargaining
agency
for
the
longshoremen
in
new
york.
and
it
negotiated
with
an
organization
called
the
new
york
shipping
association
which
was
the
agent
for
the
employers.
now,
in
the
years
1950
and
in
1951,
mr.
ryan
received
from
two
stevedoring
operators,
two
employers
in
the
port
of
new
york
sums
--
three
times,
the
sum
of
$1000,
sum
$1000
and
a
sum
of
$500.
he
received
these
from
these
--
received
these
sums
from
these
employers.
he
was
indicted
under
this
section
of
the
taft-hartley
act
for
receiving
these
sums.
and
he
was
tried
by
judge
palmieri
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
without
a
jury
and
was
found
guilty
and
he
was
sentenced
to
concurrent
sentences
of
six
months
and
a
fine
of
$2500.
on
appeal
to
the
second
circuit,
the
conviction
was
reversed
solely
on
the
following
ground.
that
section
302,
the
particular
section
involved,
relates
only
to
the
collective
bargaining
agent
itself
of
the
union.
it
does
not
relate
to
any
of
the
officials
or
negotiators
for
the
union.
judge
learned
hand
dissented.
now,
there
are
some
other
questions
in
the
case
which
the
second
circuit
did
not
go
into
and
if
the
government
should
prevail
here,
the
case
would
have
to
be
remanded
to
the
second
circuit
for
consideration
of
those
questions
of
whether
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict
and
so
forth.
the
only
issue
here
which
we
raise
is
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
as
what
we
--
having
gleaned
from
my
statement,
the
position
of
respondent
is
that
of
the
court
of
appeals.
that
when
congress
said
in
that
section
of
that
statute,
"any
representative
of
any
employees,"
it
used
the
section
representative
in
a
technical
sense
meaning
only
the
collective
bargaining
agent
and
not
the
union
officials
or
the
negotiators
for
the
union.
and,
of
course,
our
position
is
to
the
contrary.
we
rest
on
both
of
the
text
and
the
context
of
the
--
of
the
words
of
the
statute.
we
rest
on
its
legislative
history.
we
feel
that
if
the
position
of
the
respondents
and
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
sustained,
the
congressional
purpose
will
be
frustrated.
and
lastly,
we
do
not
see
anything
in
the
constitution
which
should
impel
this
court
to
uphold
the
very
narrow
and
limited
construction
which
the
second
circuit
adopted.
the
text
of
the
statute
is
contained
both
into
the
government's
brief,
in
pertinent
portion,
and
in
the
respondent's
brief.
it's
also
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
judge
frank
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
we
have
supplied
the
court,
i
believe,
with
slip
copies
of
the
full
text
of
the
statute.
section
302
appears
in
the
slip
copies
at
pages
24
through
26.
i'd
like
to
discuss
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
the
form
of
the
section
because
we
believe
that
is
a
very
important
key
to
its
meaning.
it
starts
out
by
general
broad
prohibitions.
the
first
one
is
a
--
a
prohibition
against
the
payment
by
an
employer
of
anything
of
value
to
the
representative
of
his
employees.
and
the
second
subsection
(b),
which
is
the
one
involved
here,
is
a
correlative
prohibition
on
the
receipt
by
the
representative
by
any
representative
of
any
employees
of
--
of
any
money
from
the
employer.
now,
the
subsection
(c)
contains
a
list
of
five
exceptions
from
the
prohibitions
of
(a)
and
(b).i
want
to
stress
here,
that
the
entire
statute
is
prohibitory
in
form.
that
is,
it
does
not
to
seek
to
authorize
anything.
it
prohibits
certain
things.
certain
things
are
not
prohibited
but
because
of
certain
arguments
which
the
respondent's
counsel
may
make,
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
at
the
outset
that
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
statute
to
authorize
an
overwriting
of
any
other
portion
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it's
merely
a
criminal
prohibition.
if
it
doesn't
extend
to
a
certain
activity,
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
could
not
hold
that
activity
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
a
civil
proceeding
under
--
under
or
before
that
board.
it's
prohibitory
in
form.
and
furthermore,
the
exceptions
which
appear
in
--
in
subsection
(c)
are
all
exceptions
from
(a)
and
(b).
in
other
words,
if
(a)
and
(b)
do
not
cover
a
payment
to
a
certain
person,
the
exceptions
cannot
apply.
they
can
only
apply
if
the
--
if
(a)
and
(b)
do
cover
the
payment.and
that
--
that
i
think
is
very
important
as
i
try
to
demonstrate.
so
much
for
the
general
form.
now,
the
particular
words
and
particular
phrases
of
this
statute,
"any
representative
of
any
employees,"
would
normally
seem
a
very
broad
phrase,
particularly
the
word
"any".
now,
does
the
statute
contain
any
--
any
definitions?
section
501
on
page
29
of
the
slip
copy
says
that
the
term
"representative"
along
with
some
seven
other
terms
used
in
the
act,
shall
have
the
same
meaning
as
when
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
by
the
taft-hartley
act.
so
that
takes
us
forward
to
the
definitions
used
in
section
2
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
on
page
3
of
the
slip
copy,
the
definition
is
the
term
"representatives"
includes
any
individual
or
labor
organization
--
any
individual
or
labor
organization.
now,
we
say
that
taking
those
definitions
and
in
their
breadth,
there
is
no
prohibition
or
limitation
or
restriction
in
the
statute
on
the
interpretation
of
the
phrase
"any
representative
of
any
employees"
in
its
normal
ordinary
sense,
meaning
anybody
who
stands
--
represents
the
employees,
who
speaks
on
their
behalf,
who
deals
for
them,
who
was
their
agent.
this
is
the
term
that
--
the
meaning
of
the
term
has
in
an
ordinary
speech.
if
one
goes
to
words
and
phrases
for
definitions
of
representative
in
--
in
various
context
in
the
law
that
--
that's
what
one
distills
from
--
throughout
--
from
the
whole
body
of
materials
collected
there.
not
only
that
but
in
labor
parlance,
it
has
that
meaning.
it's
somewhat
significant,
we
think,
that
in
the
hearings
of
the
taft
bill,
which
eventuated
in
the
taft-hartley
law,
both
the
president
of
the
cio,
mr.
philip
murray
and
the
president
of
the
afl,
mr.
william
green,
in
different
context
spoke
of
labor
union
leaders
as
representatives,
as
union
representatives
and
representatives
of
the
employees.
they
were
referring
to
the
individual
persons.
they
weren't
referring
only
to
the
national
organization
or
to
its
constituent
unions.
and
we
think
that
it's
significant,
too,
that
in
the
grandfather
of
all
labor
legislation,
collective
bargaining
labor
legislation,
the
railway
labor
act
and
i
--
i
emphasize
this
because
it's
not
mentioned
in
our
brief.
that
in
the
railway
labor
act,
it's
clear
as
a
bell
that
the
term
"representatives
of
the
employees"
means
the
individual
persons
who
do
the
negotiating
because
there's
a
specific
section
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
says
that
the
representative
--
representatives
of
the
employees
need
not
be
employed
by
the
character
--
by
the
carrier.
and
the
carrier
is
prohibited
from
trying
to
influence
the
--
its
employees
to
select
only
its
own
employees
as
representatives.
now,
of
course,
that
can
apply
only
to
the
individuals
who
are
doing
the
negotiating
or
the
bargaining.
so,
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
sections
302
--
302
(a)
and
(b)
alone
with
--
with
the
ordinary
view
of
english
that
one
takes
and
considering
its
background
in
--
in
normal
public
speech
and
in
the
particular
field
with
which
we're
dealing,
labor
management
relationship,
it
would
be
pretty
clear
that
when
congress
used
the
phrase
"any
representatives
--
any
representatives"
in
the
plural
of
--
of
--
no,
i'm
just
sorry.
they
used
"any
representative
of
any
employees"
that
it
meant
to
cover
a
wide
swath.
they're
not
to
limit
it
to
a
particular
type
of
organization.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
i
think
they
must
have
taken
it
from
some
other
statute
as
most
of
these
and
many
of
these
definitions
were
taken.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
but
i
think
they
mean
that
in
referring
to
a
person
who
is
the
heir
or
the
--
or
the
administrator
or
executor,
they
want
to
make
sure
that
--
that
if
somebody
do
some
back
pay
for
instance
that
it
won't
necessarily
be
refused
to
his
executor.
now,
leaving
the
prohibitory
sections
(a)
and
(b)
and
going
to
the
exceptions
in
(c),
there
are
five
in
number.
the
first
says
an
exception
for
wages
paid
to
any
representative
and
that
clearly
refers
to
an
individual,
only
an
individual
can
be
employed
by
an
employer.
and
the
second
says
an
exception
for
payments
and
satisfaction
of
an
arbitration
award
or
a
judgment
of
a
court
and
settlement
of
a
grievance
or
dispute.
well,
that
too
can
apply
--
is
more
likely
to
apply
to
individuals
because
individuals
rather
than
unions
are
the
ones
most
likely
to
get
awards
of
money.
now,
it
is
conceivable
that
a
union
could
be
covered
by
that
but
we
think
it
more
likely
that
an
individual
would
be
covered
by
that
section.
and
the
third
section
says
--
the
third
subsection
of
(c)
says
that
there's
an
exception
for
sale
or
purchases
of
any
merchandise
made
by
the
employer.
well,
it's
very
unlikely
that
a
union,
the
collective
bargaining
agent,
will
purchase
any
goods
produced
by
the
employer,
it's
very
likely
that
some
officer
of
the
union
or
representative
will
do
so.
in
fact,
senator
ball
who,
i
hope
to
be
able
to
point
out,
is
the
father
of
this
legislation
said
specifically
when
he
was
talking
about
it
on
the
floor
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
senate
when
talking
about
this
particular
subsection,
he
said,
"well,
of
course,
we
have
to
have
that
because
many
--
most
employers,
they
hope,
will
be
selling
their
merchandise
to
business
agents
of
the
union,
not
to
the
union
but
to
business
agents
of
the
union."
and
therefore,
we
have
to
have
an
exception
for
that
kind
of
transaction
between
the
labor
organization
and
somebody
--
i
mean
between
the
employer
and
the
business
agent
of
the
labor
organization.
and
the
fourth
is
a
check-off
provision
which
of
course
would
apply
only
to
union.
and
the
fifth
is
the
welfare
fund
provision.
it's
a
very
elaborate
provision
providing
that
payments
can
be
made
to
the
--
by
the
employer
only
for
the
benefit
of
certain
welfare
funds,
only
if
certain
conditions
are
met,
if
there's
a
joint
management
and
administration
by
representatives
of
the
employees
and
representatives
of
the
employers,
if
it's
--
for
certain
specific
purposes
such
as
--
not
unemployment
but
health
occupational
diseases
and
so
forth.
for
the
result
of
this
somewhat
tedious
analysis
of
the
exceptions
is
that
it
was
clearly
intended
to
apply
to
a
significant
number
of
individuals,
not
to
entities
like
unions,
to
a
significant
number
of
individuals.
well,
the
answer
given
by
judge
frank
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
given
by
the
respondent
is,
“oh,
yes,
there
are
individuals
to
whom
it
can
apply.
but
the
individuals
to
whom
it
can
apply
are
individuals
who
are
designated
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
in
themselves
collective
bargaining
agents.”
they
are
the
only
type
of
people
whom
congress
meant
to
cover
by
these
various
exceptions
relating
to
individuals.
i
think
i
will
indicate
the
significance
of
the
position
in
our
--
in
a
labor
relations
in
united
states
today
of
the
individual
bargaining
representative
when
i
tell
the
court
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
some
other
purpose
estimated
that
for
the
nine-year
period,
between
1946
and
1954,
there
were
no
more
than
10
such
in
the
whole
united
states.
and
it
does
strain
the
imagination
to
believe
that
congress
in
--
in
setting
forth
these
exceptions
which
clearly
relate
to
a
significant
body
of
individual
was
very
much
concerned
with
the
individual
bargaining
representative
and
feared
that
courts,
if
they
had
an
individual
bargaining
representative
who
received
his
wages,
would
find
him
guilty
of
violating
the
statute
nevertheless.
and
of
course
congress
is
true
that
if
--
if
the
--
these
exceptions
relate
only
to
that
handful
of
individual
bargaining
representatives,
they
don't
have
any
real
place
if
one
wonders
why
congress
included
them
at
all.
perhaps,
even
more
important
because
we
think
that
it
undermines
the
entire
basis
of
the
--
of
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
respondent
is
the
effect
on
the
welfare
fund
provision,
welfare
fund
exception
which
respondent's
interpretation
would
have.
now,
we
must
concede
that
the
welfare
fund
provision
of
the
statute
was
the
primary
focus
of
congress
in
passing
this
legislation.
they
were
interested
in
limiting
and
regulating
these
funds
which
the
unions
were,
at
that
time,
under
the
leadership
of
the
united
mine
workers
and
mr.
john
l.
lewis
beginning
to
demand
from
employers.
and
it
was
the
primary
reason,
as
mr.
waldman
will
undoubtedly
tell
the
court,
why
this
statute,
this
particular
provision
was
enacted.
we,
of
course,
claim
it
was
not
the
only
reason.
i'll
go
into
that
in
a
minute.
but
even
if
you
accept
the
fact
that
it
was
the
major
reason,
look
what
is
the
result
of
the
acceptance
of
the
respondent's
argument.
since
this
whole
section
can
only
apply,
including
its
exceptions,
if
the
payment
is
made
to
a
representative,
it
can
only
apply
under
the
respondent's
theory
if
the
payment
is
made
to
the
union
itself.
if
the
employer
should
make
the
payment
at
the
request
of
the
leader
of
the
union
to
the
president
of
the
union
--
to
the
president
of
the
union,
not
to
the
union
itself,
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
exception
as
interpreted
by
respondent.
and
therefore,
all
the
restrictions
and
the
limitations
which
congress
was
so
very
careful
to
impose
on
welfare
funds
won't
exist.
there
will
be
no
penalty
for
providing
for
a
welfare
fund
which
has
complete
employee
control
for
instance.
and
congress
was
very
careful
to
make
sure
that
there
would
be
joint
control
of
employers
and
employees.
now,
it
will
be
said
that
the
--
the
president
of
the
union
in
that
case
would
be
the
agent
of
the
union
and
so
forth.and
perhaps,
the
government,
after
long
series
of
litigation,
would
be
able
to
prove
that
fact.
but
we
think
that
the
issue
is
at
best
doubtful,
you
have
to
prove
an
agency
and
if
the
--
if
the
employer
--
employee
representative
in
our
sense,
the
union
leader
doesn't
deal
through
the
union,
you
might
have
a
hard
time
proving
it.
what
i'm
trying
to
drive
at
is
that
it
would
weaken
and
frustrate
the
purpose
of
congress,
the
prime
purpose
of
congress
according
to
the
respondent
to
limit
this
section
to
payments
to
--
to
labor
union
itself.
because
the
welfare
fund
provision,
which
was
the
important
part
from
the
point
of
view
of
respondent,
will
then
be
subject
to
evasion
and
--
and
avoidance
by
any
number
of
a
mechanisms.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
will
do
it
right
now,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
will
do
it
right
now,
mr.
justice.
we
have
here
the
president
of
the
union
who
was
a
negotiator
for
the
union.
we
think
that's
the
clearest
case.
i,
myself,
to
give
you
a
general
characterization
would
say
that
it
includes
any
negotiator
for
the
union,
any
--
any
person
who
deals
with
the
--
the
employer.
and
i
mean
not
any
of
the
negotiator
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
but
a
steward
or
a
business
agent
of
the
union
who
--
who
deals
with
the
employer
during
the
administration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
i
would
include
that
group
of
people
surely.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
but
you
can
stop
at
--
at
those
people
who
deal
with
the
--
with
the
employer.
i,
myself,
would
not
stop
there
though
i
think
one
can.
i
would
go
on
and
include
any
officer
of
the
union
even
those
who
do
not
deal
in
the
ordinary
course
of
the
business
because
officer
of
the
union
have
a
great
effect
on
the
--
on
the
activities
of
the
union
and
the
employees.
and
the
purpose
of
--
of
congress
from
our
point
of
view,
one
of
its
purposes
was
to
make
sure
that
an
employer
did
not
seduce
a
union
representative
into
taking
action
which
was
contrary
to
the
interest
of
the
employees
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer.
and
so,
i
would
want
to
cover
any
union
officer,
any
union
person,
and
i
would
take
the
officers
to
be
such,
who
was
in
a
position
where
he
could
influence
significantly
the
actions
of
the
employees
through
the
union
in
relation
to
the
employer,
who
was
in
a
position
where
he
can
influence
a
strike
or
the
withholding
of
the
strike
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
because
you
could
have
a
strike
aside
from
collective
bargaining
associations.
it
would
be
--
in
fact,
many
of
these
cases
involve
a
payment
to
somebody
to
hold
off
with
the
strike
or
to
end
the
strike.
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
deal
with
that,
i
think
congress
intended
to
deal
with
that
--
that
type
of
situation.
i've
touched
tangentially
on
--
on
the
purposes
which
we
think
congress
had
in
the
statute.
and
first,
of
course,
was
they
wanted
to
regulate
welfare
funds.
and
i
pointed
out
that
unless
you
--
you
interpret
the
word
"representative"
in
sections
--
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
of
302
to
include
individuals,
you're
going
to
limit
and
frustrate
even
that
purpose.
and
a
secondary
purpose
that
congress
had
and
it's
consistent
with
the
--
the
general
purpose
of
the
taft-hartley
law
is
to
keep
employer
influence
out
of
union
and
employee
activities.
this
is
made
clear
in
the
legislative
history.
if
i
can,
i
would
like
to
go
into
that
for
--
in
a
moment
and
it's
also,
as
i
say,
clear
from
the
--
from
the
breath
of
the
--
of
the
phrases
congress
used.
and
i
might,
in
passing
point
out,
that
if
--
if,
as
mr.
waldman
would
say,
the
regulation
of
welfare
funds
was
the
sole
purpose
of
congress,
it
certainly
used
a
peculiar
format
to
do
it.
the
welfare
funds
is
the
fifth
exception
from
two
very
broad
prohibitions
and
it
would
be
a
most
peculiar
legislative
draftsman
who
would
attempt
to
regulate
welfare
funds
in
that
way.
well,
the
great
--
the
great
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
congress
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
the
word
"representative"
in
a
peculiar
sense
that
they
used
it
to
mean
only
the
--
the
union
itself.
and
we
have
supplied
the
court
with
copies
of
the
act
in
which
the
word
"representative"
or
"represent"
or
"represented"
underlined
so
that
the
court
can
see
for
itself.
the
upshot
of
all
this
is,
is,
is
that
every
single
time
that
the
phrase
is
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
revert
--
to
refer
to
the
collective
bargaining
agent,
it
said
so
explicitly.
there
isn't
any
doubt.
it
says
the
bargaining
representative
or
the
--
the
representative,
not
any
representative
but
the
representative
of
the
employees
for
bargaining
purposes.
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
it.
i
leave
it
for
the
court
to
see
that
for
itself.
and
there
are
--
there
are
--
i'd
say
categorically,
that
the
word
"representative"
alone
--
standing
alone
is
never
used
to
refer
to
the
union.
it
is
always
qualified
by
modifying
phrases
or
words
or
adjectives.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
it
is
always
qualified.
it's
always
qualified
by
the
word
“the
representative
for
bargaining
purposes”
or
“the
representative
as
provided
in
section
9”
or
something
like
that.
and
there
are
indications
even
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
where
one
could
argue
persuasively
that
the
phrase
covers
both
the
people
who
negotiate
for
the
union
as
well
as
the
union
itself.
let
me
give
one
example.
on
page
2,
at
the
very
end
of
the
statement
of
policy,
it
provides
that
it's
the
policy
of
the
united
states
to
protect
the
exercise
by
workers
of
(inaudible)
of
associations,
self-organization
and
designation
of
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
and
so
forth.
now,
it's
very
easy
to
interpret
that
as
meaning
not
under
the
union
but
the
people
who,
on
behalf
of
the
union,
do
the
negotiating.
and
i
would
not
say
myself
in
that
--
in
that
sense
it
means
only
the
union.
when
it
means
only
the
union,
congress
was
more
explicit
as
it
is
in
section
8
and
section
9
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
then
let's
go
to
the
rest
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
act,
titles
ii,
iii
and
iv.
there,
it
is
sometimes
used
in
the
same
--
in
connection
with
--
with
other
phrases
as
meaning
the
bargaining
agent
but
it's
frequently
used
in
a
broader
sense.
i
have
time
for
only
one
example
which
i
think
is
very
significant
and
i
mention
it
because
it
is
not
in
our
brief.
on
page
24,
above
right
preceding
section
302,
which
is
the
section
we're
dealing
with,
we
have
a
section
301
which
provides
for
suits
against
labor
unions.
and
subsection
(c)
of
that
provision
provides
for
the
venue
of
suits
against
labor
unions
and
subsection
(2)
of
subsection
(c)
provides
for
the
venue
in
any
district
in
which
its
duly
authorized
officers
or
agents
are
engaged
in
representing
or
acting
for
employee
members.
that's
a
very
clear
indication
in
this
statute,
in
the
section
immediately
preceding
the
one
involved
here
that
union
officers
or
agents
are
engaged
to
represent
employee
--
employees.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
some
of
them
may
not
be
representing.
some
of
them
maybe
--
representing,
i
think,
involves
connection
with
the
employer.
that's
--
in
my
--
in
the
definition
which
i
tried
to
give
mr.
justice
frankfurter
of
the
--
one
element
in
--
in
each
part
of
the
definition
of
a
representative
that
i
tried
to
give
was
in
effect
on
the
employer.
and
it
maybe
that
there
would
be
some
officials
or
employees
of
the
union
would
have
no
relationship
to
the
employer.
section
302
itself,
the
one
--
the
one
involved
here,
certainly
uses
the
word
"representatives"
as
meaning
individuals.
on
page
25,
it
talks
about
the
administration
of
the
welfare
fund
and
it
requires
neutral
persons
as
the
representatives
of
the
employers
and
the
representatives
of
the
employees
may
agree
upon.
well,
that's
obviously
individual
persons,
not
the
union.
just
a
word,
if
i
may,
on
the
legislative
history.
the
--
the
origin
of
this
section
302
was
in
the
79th
congress
when
the
case
bill
was
being
considered
by
the
senate.
at
that
moment,
there
was
called
strike
and
mr.
john
l.
lewis
was
demanding
from
the
employers
a
large
welfare
fund
which
they
said
was
completely
unlimited
and
to
be
subject
solely
to
the
control
of
the
union
and
mr.
lewis.
senator
byrd
introduced
the
prototype
of
section
302
as
an
amendment
to
the
case
bill
at
that
time.
it's
clear
from
that
history
which
is
in
our
brief
that
it
was
in
--
that
his
amendment
was
intended
to
apply
to
labor
union
representatives
as
well
as
to
the
union
itself.
it's
also
significant
and
this
is
referred
to
in
some
citations
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
at
23
of
the
record,
not
in
our
brief,
that
at
least
four
senators,
senator
overton,
senator
hatch,
senator
hoey,
senator
tunnell
talked
about
the
very
thing
i'm
talking
about,
the
--
the
separation
of
the
influence
of
the
employer
from
that
of
the
--
of
labor
union
representatives.
senator
overton
said
labor
union
representatives
must
be
like
caesar's
wife
above
suspicion.
they
shouldn't
receive
any
payments
from
--
from
employers
because
they
will
be
seduced
from
their
loyalty
to
the
union
and
to
the
employees.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
partially,
yes,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
talking
[laughs]
--
and
of
course
there
was
a
great
interest
in
welfare
funds.
and
again,
i
want
--
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
thought
was
that
these
welfare
funds
might
get
into
the
hands
of
individual
union
leaders.
that's
very
clear
and
senator
byrd
made
it
clear
very
--
very
frequently
himself.
he
was
afraid
that
mr.
john
l.
lewis
could
himself
get
hold
of
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
and
use
it
for
--
for
his
own
purposes.
now,
if
anything,
mr.
justice,
this
supports
the
view
that
it's
not
only
the
labor
union
which
is
prohibited
from
receiving
money,
it's
the
labor
union
executive
and
of
course
that's
the
position
we're
taking
here.
well,
this
was
carried
over
into
the
80th
congress
and
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
--
the
same
arguments
were
made
there
as
had
been
made
earlier
in
the
79th
congress.
as
i
say
senator
ball,
who
was
the
father
of
the
--
of
the
amendment
in
the
80th
congress,
specifically
referred
to
union
agents.
he
specifically
referred
to
the
breath
of
the
prohibitions
which
--
which
congress
was
enacting.
and
there
was
considerable
reference
back
to
the
byrd
amendment
and
some
reference,
though
i
can't
say
too
much,
some
reference
to
preventing
the
tampering
with
employee's
loyalty
and
--
and
such
like.
undoubtedly,
mr.
waldman
will
say
that
there
was
a
great
change
in
the
conference
committee
because
there
was
a
special
definition,
it
was
--
was
originally
in
the
act
which
was
originally
in
the
byrd
amendment
which
is
carried
over
to
the
ball
amendment
which
was
dropped
out.
i
will
leave
for
rebuttal
my
answer
to
that
argument
except
to
say
that
when
the
conference
committee
made
the
change
and
definition
which
the
respondent
and
the
second
circuit
considers
so
critical,
it
said
it
accepted
the
senate
amendment
with
minor
clarifying
changes
and
we
cannot
believe
that
a
conference
committee
which
says
that
it
made
only
minor
clarifying
changes
in
--
in
a
--
in
a
section
of
the
bill,
made
the
drastic
change
which
it
is
urged
upon
this
court
and
it
was
successfully
urged
on
the
second
circuit,
it
was
made
in
this
bill.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
is
clear,
i
think,
both
in
the
argument
and
the
brief
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
--
the
main
focus
of
the
argument
is
that
a
deletion
of
the
special
definition
of
representative
which
was
originally
in
the
byrd
amendment
and
in
the
ball
amendment
and
its
--
the
substitution
of
the
amendment
of
the
definitions
which
appear
in
the
act
is
given
as
the
reason
for
the
complete
and
drastic
change
in
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
it
is
true
that
senator
ives
was
a
member
of
the
conference
committee
but
so
was
senators
taft
and
senators
--
and
senator
ball
who
were
the
sponsors
of
this
legislation.
senator
--
and
it
supported
it
both
in
the
prior
congress
and
in
the
present
congress.
and
i
repeat
that
the
conference
committee
called
it
a
minor
clarifying
change.
all
--
i
think
if
one
--
if
--
and
they
gave
no
recognitions
at
all,
there
was
no
recognition
in
the
debates
after
the
conference
committee
came
in
that
there
was
any
change
in
the
--
in
the
substance
of
--
of
coverage
of
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
was
a
special
definition
of
representative
which
was
included
in
302
as
it
passed
the
senate,
of
senator
ball's
amendment.
the
conference
committee
deleted
that
--
that
definition,
inserted
the
word
"representative"
in
the
general
definition
section.
and
that's
all
we
think
they
were
doing.
they
were
conformed,
taking
a
special
definition
out
and
putting
--
putting
it
in
the
general
definition
section.
and
as
a
matter
of
draftsmanship
i
--
i
would
suppose.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
as
originally
introduced
by
senator
byrd,
it
did
not
have
this
--
this
definition.senators
ives
and
pepper
said,
"oh,
it
will
prevent
an
employer
from
giving
money
for
a
picnic.we'll
recite
the
union
representatives."
and
senator
byrd
said,
"if
you
think
it
will
do
that,
i
do
not.i
am
willing
to
have
this
special
definition
in."
that
was
included
in
the
byrd
amendment.
and
then
when
the
whole
matter
was
recanvassed
in
the
next
session
of
congress,
it
was
included
originally
in
the
ball
amendment.
and
the
conferees,
i
think
as
i
said
before,
simply
as
a
matter
of
draftsmanship,
took
it
out
and
put
it
in
the
general
definition,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
this
case
it
was
not
made
against
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
do
not
know,
mr.
justice.
there
have
been
other
cases
in
which
a
charge
was
made
against
the
employer.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
it
does
and
there
are
other
cases
in
which
charges
