mr.
louis
waldman
it
pleases
the
court.
it's
already
anticipated.
our
position
is
that
the
word
"representative"
used
in
section
302
of
the
taft-hartley
act
have
a
statutory
meaning
of
the
concept
of
representatives
of
employees
is
a
new
concept,
a
statutory
concept.
so
that
it
is
vague
to
look
to
the
labor
--
to
the
railway
labor
act
or
to
colloquially
or
to
dictionary
definition
to
determine
what
congress
meant
in
section
302.
and
if
we've
got
to
understand
this
fundamental
fact
of
the
word
"representative
of
employee"
is
not
the
same
as
"representative
of
a
union"
that
even
a
union
is
not
the
same
as
representative
of
employees,
we
shall
grasp
the
significance
of
the
difference
between
the
point
of
view
of
the
respondent
and
the
point
of
view
of
the
government
which
is
a
new
point
of
view.
now,
the
--
there
is
a
definition
written
by
congress
in
the
taft-hartley
act
which
is
glossed
over
here
as
if
it
had
not
been
written
at
all
but
to
which
we
insist
we
must
advert
to
determine
the
clause
which
the
court
has
to
take
in
determining
the
meaning
of
the
word
"representative".
that
clause
is
written
in
the
last
title,
title
v
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
it
is
quoted
in
full
at
page
4
of
our
brief.
and
by
this
section,
congress
has
said
that
the
term
"representative"
shall
have
the
same
meaning
as
been
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
by
this
act,
not
as
defined
as
the
venerable
judge
hand
thought
in
his
opinion
but
the
same
meaning
as
when
used
in
the
act.
now,
then
our
search
must
immediately
be
directed
to
the
manner
in
which
the
word
"representative"
has
been
used
by
the
national
labor
relation
act
as
amended.
your
honors
will
recall
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
which
consists
in
five
titles,
has
amended
the
old
wagner
act
which
had
been
on
the
books
for
12
years
and
that
is
still
called
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
labor
management
act,
which
is
the
taft-hartley
act,
includes
a
good
deal
more
than
the
old
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
now,
then
what
is
our
first
step
in
the
quest
in
determining
how
the
word
"representative"
is
used
by
the
national
labor
relations
act?
the
first
quest
is
to
determine
the
scheme
and
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relation
act
as
originally
drafted
and
enacted
and
as
amended
in
1947.
the
scheme
and
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
every
student
of
labor
law
know
was
a
fundamental
departure
from
the
old
concept
of
labor
relation
in
which
the
union
was
accepted
as
the
spokesman
for
its
members
and
a
few
friends
of
members.
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
originally
provided
in
the
--
in
1935,
a
constituency
was
created,
a
legal
constituency
in
the
same
way
the
congressional
constituency
or
gubernatorial
constituency
or
senatorial
constituency.
and
we
call
that
the
bargaining
unit,
but
instead
of
defining
it
in
the
act
because
of
the
very
complex
nature
of
our
industrial
life,
they
created
an
administrative
board
which
--
to
which
it
had
given
certain
criteria
by
which
to
determine
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit.
that
might
be
the
plant
or
a
craft
within
the
plant
or
a
market
or
in
our
case,
the
port
of
new
york.
once
the
geographical
local
is
determined
by
the
board,
the
bargaining
unit
who
constitutes
the
electorate,
the
employee,
not
members
of
the
union,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
trade
union,
has
nothing
to
do
with
union
officials.
you
will
search
the
wagner
act
to
find
all
these
arguments
that
we
have
heard
both
in
the
brief
and
orally
about
union
officials
being
interchangeably
used
with
"representatives
of
employee".
the
constituencies
within
the
collective
bargaining
unit
become
not
members
of
the
union
but
the
workers
in
that
unit.
then
the
act
proceeded
to
set
up
machinery
for
election
or
designation
or
recognition,
the
equivalent
of
election
and
it
set
up
governmental
machinery
to
conduct
the
election.
and
then
the
certification
and
whoever
recertified
or
recognized
that
the
representative
of
employee
then
becomes
close
by
federal
statute
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
under
the
wagner
act
with
powers
and
responsibilities.
and
then
the
act
proceeds
to
in
--
create
duties
on
the
part
of
the
employer
in
dealing
with
those
representatives
for
the
union,
both
the
representatives
of
employees.
then
there
is
another
principle
written
in
that
law
which
is
very
pertinent
to
our
discussion
in
an
understanding
of
section
302,
that
a
representative
of
employees
even
exclusive
representative,
there
cannot
be,
under
the
law,
more
than
one
representative.
i'm
talking
now
about
the
scheme
and
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
that
statutory
representative
elected
or
designated
as
i
have
described,
under
the
law,
bargains
not
for
any
one
group
in
particular
but
for
the
entire
group
of
employees,
even
if
only
51%
of
the
employees
has
voted
for
it.
it
becomes
a
statutory
personality
created
under
the
law.
now,
that
scheme
will
be
born
in
mind
as
we
continue
our
course
into
1947
through
the
period
of
12
years
almost
from
the
first
moment
the
wagner
act
became
law.
the
country
will
pretty
much
divide
it
on
the
part
of
industrialist,
management,
thoughtful
students
of
the
problem
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
proper
to
continue
this
policy
of
permitting
a
majority
of
employees
to
bind
everybody
else.
and
the
struggle
was
reflected
in
the
form
of
the
union
shop
and
the
close
shop
and
preferential
shop
and
a
myriad
other
problems
in
labor
relations,
all
to
the
end
that
a
majority
of
employees
shall
not
bind
those
who
didn't
vote
for
it.
that
struggle
reached
the
climax
in
two
years
in
succession
in
1946
and
1947.
in
1946,
there
was
pending
in
congress
a
law,
a
very
controversial
law
called
the
case
a
bill
--
called
the
case
bill.
when
the
case
bill
came
on,
it
was
not
the
labor
relations
bill,
it
was
not
exactly
like
the
taft-hartley
bill,
but
it
was
a
bill
intended
to
curve
what
was
then
thought
to
be
the
excess
power
of
labor.
and
while
that
bill
was
pending,
john
l.
lewis,
with
his
very
great
genius
for
--
for
timing
his
activity,
made
the
demand
for
10
cents
a
ton
to
be
contributed
to
a
welfare
fund
of
the
united
mine
workers
which
the
united
mine
workers
administered
solely,
not
by
any
trust
arrangement
with
the
employer.
a
strike
was
threatened.senator
byrd
of
virginia
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
case
law.
that
amendment
is
the
one
which
has
called
forth
a
great
deal
of
the
debate.
in
1946,
quoted
in
the
government
brief
and
that
amendment
proceeded
in
the
legislative
row.
it
was
changed
by
way
of
amendments.
in
the
first
instance,
the
byrd
amendment
outlawed
welfare
and
pension
funds
all
together.
later,
there
was
an
amendment
to
permit
welfare
and
pension
funds
with
--
with
--
under
regulation
as
--
as
called
for
in
that
amendment.
and
there
was
a
special
definition,
your
honors,
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
"representative"
in
that
amendment
of
the
case
bill.
we
quote
the
special
definition
in
our
brief
at
page
58,
"it
is
substantially
the
same
definition
as
later
found
its
way
to
the
amendment
of
the
taft-hartley
act."
when
the
case
bill
passed
both
houses,
together
with
the
byrd
amendment
and
the
special
definition,
the
president
at
that
time
vetoed
the
bill
and
it
failed
to
receive
the
necessary
two-thirds
for
reenactment.
in
1947,
when
congress
undertook
to
overhaul
the
entire
labor
relations
picture,
public
hearings
were
held
on
the
pending
bill.senator
taft
was
then
chairman
of
the
committee.
but
he
couldn't
muster
a
majority
of
the
committee
to
incorporate
what
senator
byrd
first
provided
in
the
amendment
to
the
case
bill
the
year
before.
but
five
senators,
headed
by
senators
taft,
ball,
and
jenner
wrote
the
supplemental
section
to
the
labor
report
when
the
bill
came
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
1947
in
which
they
urged
the
incorporation
in
the
then
tart
--
taft
act
in
the
senate,
the
substance
of
the
byrd
amendment
in
the
case
bill
which
failed
the
passage
in
1946,
failed
the
passage
over
the
president's
veto.
then
four
senators,
not
five,
although
the
supplemental
report
was
written
by
five,
headed
again
by
taft,
ball,
and
jenner
moved
an
amendment
from
the
floor,
the
substance
of
present
section
302
carrying
with
it
a
special
definition,
the
same
one
that
is
now
quoted
at
page
58.
now,
under
that
definition
all
that
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
do
now
would
have
been
accomplished.
they
could
have
had
indictments
to
their
hearts
content.
they
could
have
taken
civil
actions
by
injunctions
to
their
hearts
content
against
union
officials.
if
you'll
read
that
definition,
you
will
see
why.
now,
a
very
lucid
and
scholarly
speech
on
the
entire
act
was
made
by
senator
morse
showing
the
havoc
and
the
chaos
that
would
be
introduced
in
the
entire
national
labor
relations
picture
if
an
attempt
were
made
in
section
302,
which
was
then
the
byrd
amendment,
by
enabling
employers
to
make
agreements
with
minority
groups
within
his
plant
or
within
the
bargaining
unit
and
by
destroying
the
whole
scheme
of
the
wagner
act
which
rested
on
the
industrial
democratic
principle
of,
one,
the
constituency
had
been
defined
and
the
election
was
taken
and
the
majority
votes
were
cast,
the
representatives
was
clothed
with
the
power
to
speak
for
all.
now,
it
is
obvious
to
any
labor
historian,
why
if
you
don't
like
labor
unions
or
labor
or
the
advance
or
progress
that
labor
makes,
you
would
seek
to
introduce,
a
divisive
force
into
the
collective
bargaining
unit
so
that
the
employer,
who
is
unfriendly
to
a
powerful
union
or
a
union
that's
aggressive
on
behalf
of
the
people
it
represents,
it
can
play
ball
with
the
minority
union
until
it
builds
it
up
to
be
a
formal
competitor.
and
then,
perhaps,
replace
the
other
union.
senator
ives,
who
is
probably
among
the
most
advanced
and
intelligent
labor
relations
men
on
the
republican
side
in
the
senate,
objected
to
this
proposal
though
sponsored
by
his
own
party
leadership
and
voted
against
the
amendment
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
then
it
came
up
but
it
passed
with
this
special
definition.
senator
ball
in
a
statement
to
the
senate
frankly
enough,
said
of
the
special
definition
disagreed
and
differed
from
the
definition
of
representative
as
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
louis
waldman
i
--
i'm
quoting
at
page
58,
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
waldman
--
of
--
of
our
brief.
mr.
louis
waldman
then
a
conference
committee
was
appointed
to
iron
out
the
differences
between
the
hartley
bill
in
the
house
and
the
taft
bill
in
the
senate.
now,
the
hartley
bill
did
not
have
any
part
of
section
302.
senator
ives
significantly
was
appointed
a
member
of
that
committee.
he
voted
against
this
proposal
with
a
special
definition.
then
the
harmonized
statute
bill
came
out
of
the
conference
committee,
three
changes
were
made
in
the
taft
bill.
one,
they
dropped
the
special
definition,
two,
they
substituted
a
new
definition,
namely,
that
the
word
"representative"
as
used
in
this
entire
act
including
section
302
shall
have
the
meaning
and
use
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
now,
in
the
amendments,
your
honors,
in
1947
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
scheme
of
representation,
the
scheme
that
empowered
by
statute
representatives
of
a
bargaining
unit
to
be
the
sole
and
exclusive
spokesman
for
that
unit.
it
was
never
changed.
that
remained.
the
taft-hartley
law
created
reciprocal
duties
that
these
representatives
of
employees
must
act
also
in
a
good
faith
way
with
employer
and
management
representatives.
now,
after
these
changes
were
made
and
there's
another
change
which
is
not
significant
in
connection
with
our
present
argument,
then
senator,
"i
won't
vote
it
for
the
entire
law,"
and
taft-hartley
became
a
law.
it
is
this
text
that
we
are
talking
about
and
not
the
debates
that
were
held
on
a
section
with
the
amendment
which
was
discarded
and
scrapped
and
abandoned
by
congress.
and
what
the
government
is
seeking
to
do
now
after
seven
years
of
not
touching
this
act
in
the
manner
in
which
it
is
now
being
utilized
is
to
bring
back
by
judicial
construction
what
congress
itself
rejected
as
unsound
because
it
would
create
havoc
in
the
national
labor
relations
law.
now,
how
could've
it
created
havoc?
senator
morse
pointed
it
out,
i
briefly
touched
on
it.
now,
we
say
to
your
honors
that
after
giving
you
the
scheme
and
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
clothed
a
special
legal
personality
with
the
name
"representative
of
employee",
they
come
along
and
this
is
very
a
loose
kind
of
talk
in
labor
parlance
that
mr.
green
and
mr.
murray
used
the
word
“representative”
in
connection
with
some
testimonial.
of
course,
union
officers
are
representatives
of
the
union.
and,
of
course,
labor
men
will
say
a
labor
leader
is
a
representative
of
his
union.
but
there
is
vast
difference
in
law.
under
the
law
we're
talking
about,
between
a
representative
of
employees
which
is
one
concept,
a
legal
concept
and
representatives
of
a
union
which
is
something
else
all
together.
mr.
louis
waldman
the
form
was
substantially
as
it
is
now
plus
a
subdivision
(g)
which
was
the
special
definition
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
58.
when
it
came
out
congress,
that
definition
was
abandoned
and
the
new
definition,
that
is
the
present
definition,
was
put
in.
now,
your
honors
--
mr.
louis
waldman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
waldman
the
house
didn't
have
that
provision.
the
house
didn't
have
a
section
302
provision
when
it
connected
its
bill.
mr.
louis
waldman
that's
right.
and
then
both
houses
adopted.
so,
we
are
dealing
with
an
entirely
different
history,
a
history
of
deed,
not
words.
the
words
don't
count
here
because
the
words
addressed
themselves
to
another
provision.
now,
we
say
after
the
first
step
in
the
quest
as
to
how
the
word
"representative"
is
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
what's
the
second
step?
an
honest
search,
what
did
congress
mean
by
this
if
we
can
ever
discover
what
congress
means
by
any
statute.
we
can
only
judge
it
by
certain
outside
objectives,
purpose,
aim,
direction.
we
are
--
we
have
addressed
ourselves
to
an
analysis
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended,
not
in
terms
of
verbs.
verbs
don't
mean
anything
here.
we
are
talking
of
the
noun
"representative"
as
used
in
sections
3
(a)
and
(b).
you
can
do
an
awful
lot
with
verbs
but
that
isn't
the
issue.
we
are
not
involved
here
with
the
verb.
now,
the
noun
“representative”
in
relation
to
employees
is
used,
your
honors,
25
times
in
16
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
we
set
forth
in
proper
numerical
order
and
in
the
addendum
too,
all
of
those
provisions
in
the
manner
in
which
the
word
"representative"
is
used
and
in
all
cases
without
a
single
exception,
the
word
"representative"
is
used
in
the
statutory
sense
and
not
in
the
colloquial
or
any
other
sense.
and
this
is
what
congress
meant
in
its
definition
when
it
said
that
the
word
must
be
as
used
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
that
was
the
final
judgment
of
congress
in
its
own
legislation,
shall
be
as
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
the
government,
by
some
twist
of
logic
which
i
can't
understand
and
never
could
understand
from
the
beginning
of
this
prosecution,
seems
to
say,
"yes,
that
may
be
true."
that
is
after
it's
been
pointed
out
to
them
in
very
rudimentary
passion.
it's
true
that
the
word
"representative"
means
a
statutory
personality
but
in
--
in
the
cases
we
know
about,
it's
qualified
by
the
word
"collective
bargaining"
as
subject
to
this
section.
now,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one
is
the
answer
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
and
that
we
have
given,
certainly
both
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
here.
that
is
not
the
fact.
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
the
court
of
appeals
cites
certain
portions
of
the
act
where
there
are
no
qualifying
phrases
and
yet
the
word
"representative"
is
used
in
the
only
sense
in
which
it
can
be
used,
namely,
the
statutory
sense
because
it
was
a
new
statutory
creature.
it
didn't
exist
before.
now,
there's
another
answer
to
that.and
i
think
the
answer
is
complete.
they
say
that
it
is
used
by
qualifying
language,
supposing
that's
so.
they
say
"representative”
in
its
context
means
what
the
respondent
say
it
means,
supposing
that's
so.
congress
said
in
its
definition
501
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
"representative"
shall
be
as
used
and
if
it
is
used
with
qualifying
words
if
you
find
that
used
in
the
context,
what
of
it?
that's
exactly
what
congress
said
shall
be
given
--
the
meaning
to
be
given
to
that
word.
now,
i
can't
understand
this
persistence
of
thinking
that
they
are
making
an
argument
on
a
statutory
construction
which
is
valid
when
in
my
opinion
it
doesn't
follow
the
conclusion
which
they
seek
the
court
to
draw
from
this
argument.
now,
they
make
an
argument
on
the
analysis
of
the
statute.
i
say
to
you,
this
honorable
court,
i
wouldn't
permit
it.
it
took
two
hours
to
argue
to
the
court
of
appeals.
but
in
the
brief
time
that
i
have,
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
even
if
we
didn't
have
any
of
these
other
material,
the
history
and
the
statutory
context
and
the
scheme.
that
if
you
analyze
section
302
alone,
you
will
find
that
the
government
is
grievously
in
error,
either
what
the
purpose
and
aim
of
the
section
was
or
what
the
meaning
of
the
language
in
that
section
is.
they're
in
error
because
they
don't
know
the
facts
of
labor.apparently,
i
can
tell
that
from
the
argument.
and
secondly,
they
are
in
error
because
they
are
straining
to
give
a
meaning
to
a
statute
which
doesn't
have
that
meaning.
now,
what
does
section
302
do?
what
is
its
purpose?
what
was
the
--
what
do
the
authors
intend
to
accomplish
by
that
section?
not
to
purify
collective
bargaining.
after
all,
we
are
all
living
people.
we've
lived
in
1947
and
we
have
lived
all
the
period
since
and
for
sometime
before.
and
it
wasn't
the
purpose
of
the
authors
of
section
302
to
purify
the
collective
bargaining
process
or
to
improve
labor's
picture
in
it.
the
purpose
of
section
302,
its
broadest
purpose
was
to
limit
the
area
and
scope
of
collective
bargaining.
it
is
a
very
important
section
of
the
act.
your
honors
interpretation
of
that
section
has
a
very
far
reaching
importance.
it's
--
the
authors
of
that
section
started
out
originally
by
outlawing
all
territory
in
collective
bargaining
by
representatives
of
workers
with
employers
which
didn't
accept
the
old
copy
book
standard,
wages,
hours
and
immediate
conditions
of
employment.
but
once
labor
have
reached
out
for
pensions
and
welfare
and
in
time
of
war
since
wages
--
wage
--
raises
were
frozen,
they
began
to
reach
out
for
fringe
benefits.
research
people
and
scholars
and
the
employer
of
labor
unions
began
to
write
about
a
profit
sharing
plan
and
guaranteed
wages
and
all
kinds
of
schemes
which
labor
might
aspire
someday
to
make
demands
on
management,
be
they
right
or
wrong.
congress
in
1947,
under
the
leadership
that
then
prevailed,
wanted
to
put
an
end
to
it.
and
they
said,
“we
are
going
to
circumscribe
the
area
and
the
scope
of
collective
bargaining.
and
that
would
be
genesis
and
the
meaning
of
section
302.”
but
they
couldn't
muster
enough
strength
if
they
intended
at
that
time,
at
that
late
date
to
outlaw
welfare
and
pension
benefits.
they
wanted
to
outlaw
checkoffs.
they
finally
compromised
and
settled
on
regulated
checkoffs.
that's
the
meaning
of
one
portion
of
this
section.they
finally
compromised
in
allowing
pensions
and
welfare
but
regulating
it.
but
then
as
your
honors
read
the
section
itself,
without
any
help
from
me,
our
brief
reads
it
fairly,
fully.
your
honors
will
find
that
subdivision
by
subdivision,
section
302
breeds
the
meaning
that
it
was
intended
(a),
to
curve
the
area
of
collective
bargaining
and
(b),
to
regulate
welfare
funds
and
limit
the
checkoff.
i
see
my
light
is
bringing
me
to
a
close
and
i
want
to
say
to
your
honors
that
some
of
the
points
that
we
have
briefed
here,
such
as
the
constitutional
question,
such
as
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
the
kind
of
provision,
the
government
said
this
provision
means,
all
of
these
matters
are
argued
by
us
in
the
brief,
merely
to
point
out
the
fact
that
the
statute
can
be
sustained
on
the
basis
of
honest
reading
of
its
history
and
an
honest
reading
of
its
purpose
and
above
all,
by
following
the
mandate
of
congress
in
the
words
and
provisions
they
have
written
for
the
courts
to
interpret.
thank
you.
