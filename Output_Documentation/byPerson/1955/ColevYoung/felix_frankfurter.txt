justice

frankfurter
in
short,
your
confidence
--
in
short,
your
confidence,
as
the
court
put
it,
so
that
you
don't
argue
the
constitutional
question.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
are
saying
here
is
that
for
this
employee
to
ever
invoke
the
standard
based
on,
for
instance,
the
president's
order
is
different
from
the
standard
embodied
in
the
act
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
please
tell
me
why
the
president
can't,
by
virtue
of
his
office,
promulgate
any
standard
reason
for
the
termination
of
employee
of
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
with
the
meyers
case,
where
congress
actually
passed
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
the
senate
imposed
a
qualification,
and
the
president
said
that
this
court
sustained
him
that
you
can't
make
any
rules
on
the
inherent
power
of
the
president.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
if
congress
tomorrow
passes
a
statute
saying
the
postman
is
to
be
appointed
by
the
post
master
general
for,
not
more
than
four
years,
the
meyers
case
will
be
out
of
the
way?
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wonder
what's
the
scope
of
that
case
is.
i
could
assure
you,
that
left
me
not
on
the
problem
of
the
court
here.
however,
the
government
doesn't
raise
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
applies
to
you
being
directly
advising
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
have
to
have,
in
derogatory
in
your
file,
to
have
difficulties
challenging
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
what
--
how
all
of
this
could
lead
to
that
sense
that
it
has
to
be
established
superlatively.
you
couldn't
think
for
the
government
to
have
us
where
we
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
could
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
you
have
to
establish
that,
apart
from
the
meyers
problem,
and
that
is
the
real
problem
itself,
apart
from
that
problem,
you
have
to
establish
that
this
statute
promulgated
by
the
president
was
undermining
his
power
as
written
by
the
congress
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
you
have
to
establish
that
with
all
the
presumption
mr.
president
of
the
united
states
must
have
some
leeway
in
construing
what
powers
are
congress
of
united
states
gave
him,
even
though
when
it's
construed
by
the
president,
namely,
who
should
be
employees
of
the
federal
government.
who
are
the
instrument
of
the
executive
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
controversy
between
you
and
the
government
on
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
you
don't
have
to
make
it
a
point.
i
don't
believe
that
they
wouldn't
add
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
all
the
documents
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
shapiro,
let's
see
if
i
am
--
if
i
am
correct
in
assuming
--
am
i
correct
in
assuming,
to
understand
this,
that
the
only
documentation
before
us
on
the
basis
of
which
his
employment
was
terminated
was
a
letter
giving
these
five
charges
that
had
been
written
a
while
ago
in
answer
to
justice
harlan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
his
reply
on
paper
refusing
to
answer
the
inquiry
terminated,
and
the
termination
letter
from
the
president
to
say,
on
the
basis
of
that,
those
charges
and
other
documents,
not
disclosed,
will
all
turn
into
the
government's
second
hand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
action
concluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
you
say
--
you
say,
on
the
basis
of
that,
he
wasn't
dismissed
because
he
was
asked
questions
as
a
possible
witness.
that
is
not
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
case,
as
i
think,
you
lead
us
to
private
parties
to
try
and
attempt
an
elongated
argument
that
this
is
here.
there's
a
statute
by
the
congress
enumerating
the
tests
for
continuance
of
employment
or,
what
you
say
explicitly,
that
they
do
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
security
reasons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
further
authorization
from
the
president,
allowing
him
to
enlarge
those
specified
agencies
and
such
other
agencies
that
he
so
sees
fit
to
extend
and
see,
and
you
say
that
is
also
limited
by
the
security
requirement
and,
further,
the
executive
order
of
the
president
(a)
cannot
be
applied
to
non-sensitive
positions
and
(b)
it
cannot
enlarge
the
test
which
congress
has
laid
down
here.
is
that
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
correct
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
must
be
with
the
reference
to
security.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
to
state
that.
he
could
enlarge
it,
he
could
apply
it
to
all,
but
if
he
immediately
asked
you
to
leave
all
potential
in
his
judgment,
it
must
satisfy
the
test
of
security,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
ever
large
that
be,
and
the
new
case,
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
no
proof
that
it
is
for
the,
interim,
is
an
enlargement
and,
indeed,
in
some
ways
contradiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
have
--
you'd
have
to
satisfy
the
court
that
that
is
so,
and
how
do
you
satisfy
the
court
that
that
is
so?
what
kind
of
--
what
are
the
considerations
that
should
lead
us
to
restriction
to
file
the
burden
(a)
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
extended
to
everybody
on
the
hearing
again
have
a
special
case
finding
out
what
is
and
what
isn't
exactly
is
the
test
they
used
and
(b)
his
interpretation
of
security
is
the
negative
form
of
which
is
which.
that's
your
test,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
that
you
do
not
join
issue
with
the
statement
that
failure
to
make
comments
on
these
enquiries
is
not
one
of
the
basis
for
this
determination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
enough
of
--
enough
of
the
government's
position.
is
it
not
here
that
section
3
is
entitled
to
be
construed
by
the
president
as
though
congress
has
written,
instead
of
what
it
has
written,
the
provision
of
this
act
shall
apply
to
certain
other
departments
and
agencies
of
the
government
as
the
president
may,
from
time
to
time,
deem
necessary
in
the
best
interest
of
the
national
welfare?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
accept
that?
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
accept
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
make
a
--
my
argument
is
intended
as
an
innuendo.
it
was
intended
to
translate
in
words
what
i
understood
you
to
translate
the
position
of
the
government,
namely,
that
it's
not
for
a
court
to
consider
what
the
president
concedes
the
national
security
to
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
subsequently
consider
quarrelling
or
arguing
about
security
in
a
restricted
sense.
he
may
--
national
welfare
would
be
covered.
do
you
reject
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
anyone
then
--
then,
security
must
have
a
narrower
scope
than
welfare.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
whatever
discretion,
whatever
scope
he
gave
you,
presidential
translation
or
application
of
a
congressional
standard,
if
it
is,
as
you
so
admittedly
seem
to
indicate,
there
is
a
great
deal
--
there
is
a
difference
to
acknowledge
here.
obviously,
it's
in
authorizing
to
apply
national
security
against
national
welfare.
then,
the
court
could
see
whether,
in
a
particular
case,
he
had
exceeded
the
allowable
limit
of
giving
concept
to
“national
security.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
if
--
if
you
may
give
any
stroke
to
it,
any
meaning
to
it,
that
increase
it,
then
the
implication
of
restriction,
using
a
particular
word,
a
particular
concept
or
area
or
the
number
of
limits
may
be,
suppose,
by
the
board,
is
sufficient
to
mean
“welfare.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
decided
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
the
real
argument
isn't
arguing
whether
leaf
raker
or
this
fellow
in
the
department
and
you're
a
tempt,
or
whatever
you
are,
whether
that
can
argumentatively
be
found
to
have
some
potentiality
within
security,
then
the
real
proposition
is
that
this
case
is
likely
to
--
that
the
president's
power
to
pass
on
to
the
agency,
it
did
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
waterman
case
is
not
with
you.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
so
understood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
finding
on
which
he
was
discharged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
--
that
was
a
case
not
completed
yet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
being
rescreened.
he
was
reexamined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
because
of
the
10450?
