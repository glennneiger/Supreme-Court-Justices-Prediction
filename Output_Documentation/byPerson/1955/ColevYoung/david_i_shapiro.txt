mr.
david
i.
shapiro
may
it
please
the
court.
effective
january
20,
1954,
kendrick
m.
cole,
a
world
war
ii
veteran,
was
dismissed
from
his
federal
job
on
the
ground
that
his
continued
employment
was
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
two-to-one
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
which
upheld
the
dismissal
of
the
petitioner's
complaint
and
the
granting
of
respondent's
motion
for
cross
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
it
is
conceded
by
respondents
that
petitioner
cole,
in
his
job,
had
no
access
to
any
government
secrets
or
classified
information,
that
he
could
not
influence
or
make
policy
in
his
particular
position,
and
that
he
was
not
charged
with
being
a
disloyal
employee.
in
this
last
connection,
i
think
i
should
refer
to
the
respondent's
brief
in
the
court
below
where
they
said,
and
i'd
like
to
quote,
“the
charges
against
appellant,”
mr.
cole
in
that
case,
“do
not
imply
any
knowing
acts
of
disloyalty
on
his
part.”
that's
at
page
6
of
their
brief.
and,
on
page
17,
i
quote
again,
“as
appellant
correctly
said,
in
the
charges
made
against
me,
i
am
not
accused
of
doing
or
saying
anything
which
would
indicate
that
i
am
disloyal
to
the
government
of
this
country.”
we
contend
that,
on
these
conceded
facts,
former
secretary
hobby
could
not
have
discharged
mr.
cole
under
public
law
733,
the
1950
security
risk
statute
for
sensitive
agencies.
we
contend
that
that
statute
is
not
applicable
to
a
loyal
employee
holding
a
nonsensitive,
non-policy
making
position
in
an
agency
whose
functions
are
not
directly
related
to
this
nation's
military,
foreign
affairs,
or
preparedness
programs.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
we
do
not
do
that
either.
we
raise
the
constitutional
argument
only
in
connection
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
we
say
that
we
think
the
court
would
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
if
it
held
that
the
statute
could
properly
be
applicable
to
mr.
cole's
dismissal.
secondly,
we
contend
that
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
sir.
secondly,
section
3
of
the
statute
which
authorize
the
president
to
extend
the
provisions
of
section
1
of
the
law,
that's
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
law,
to
other
agencies
and
departments
of
the
government
when
he
deemed
it
necessary
in
the
best
interest
of
the
national
security
to
do
so,
we
say,
did
not
authorize
him
to
establish
a
single
rigid
minimum
standard
for
all
federal
employment,
sensitive
and
non
sensitive
alike,
in
each
and
every
agency
and
department
of
the
government.
and,
that
standard,
that
single
rigid
minimum
standard,
was
the
standard
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
even
if
we
were
to
assume
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
what
we
are
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
the
president
under
section
3
of
this
statute
which
authorized
him
to
extend
it
to
other
agencies
selectively,
just
merely
to
extend
the
statute,
didn't
authorize
him
to
extend
under
the
statute
a
single
rigid
standard
for
all
kinds
of
employees
within
the
particular
departments.
we
contend
that
the
authority
he
had
was
to
extend
the
statute
to
the
entire
government,
but
he
couldn't
establish,
for
all
kinds
of
employment
within
the
particular
agencies
themselves,
a
single
standard
for
determining
the
security
status
of
employees.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
sir.
that
is
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
answer,
sir,
is
found
in
article
2,
section
2,
clause
2
of
the
constitution
where
congress
has
spoken
with
respect
to
inferior
offices
and
employees
of
the
government.
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
congress
can
properly
restrict
his
removal
power.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
in
the
meyers
case,
we
had
a
completely
different
situation
because
the
employee
in
that
question
--
in
that
case,
i
understand,
was
the
type
of
employee
who
was
appointed
by
and
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
that
case
is
not
applicable
to
a
situation
where
the
congress
has
vested
the
appointing
power
in
the
agency
heads
rather
than
in
the
president.
and,
in
this
particular
case,
the
appointing
power
was
vested
in
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
therefore,
since
congress
vested
the
appointing
power
in
the
agency
head,
it
could
also
restrict
the
power
of
the
agency
head
with
respect
to
such
acts
as
the
lloyd-lafollette
acts
and
the
veterans'
preference
acts
which,
i
understand,
are
valid
restrictions
upon
the
executive's
removal
power.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
we
contend
that,
with
respect
to
this
standard
established
by
the
executive
order,
this
clearly
consistent
standard,
that
it
established
a
much
more
onerous
burden
on
mr.
cole
than
the
necessary
or
advisable
standard
which
was
established
by
the
congress.
now,
apart
from
any
other
consideration,
we
contend
that
the
dismissal
motives
of
the
secretary,
which
was
furnished
to
mr.
cole
on
about
january
15,
1954
and
which
stated
that
his
continued
employment
was
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security,
was
not
a
written
statement
of
the
decision
of
the
agency
head
as
that
term
was
used
by
congress
in
public
law
733,
the
statute
under
which
mr
cole
was
dismissed.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
as
i
said
before,
mr.
cole
was
a
food
and
drug
inspector
and
his
job
was
to
inspect
for
health
regulatory
and
other
purposes
those
foods,
drugs,
and
cosmetics
which
are
normally
subject
to
federal
regulation.
as
a
veterans'
preference
eligible,
he
was
covered
by
both
the
veterans'
preference
and
lloyd-lafollette
acts.
on
november
13,
1953,
he
was
suspended
from
his
job
pursuant
to
an
investigation
under
executive
order
10450.
a
few
days
later,
he
received
a
set
of
charges
which
alleged
that
he
had
a
close
association
with
individuals
who
were
reliably
reported
to
be
communists,
and
a
sympathetic
association
with
an
organization
listed
as
subversive
by
the
attorney
general,
the
nature
friends
of
america.
on
december
23rd
of
that
year,
while
just
coming
out
of
the
hospital
from
a
very
serious
operation,
mr.
cole
wrote
a
letter
refusing
to
make
any
explanation
of
these
charges
claiming
that
they
violated
his
inherent
basic
right
of
freedom
of
association.
he
was
then
informed
that
the
matter
was
being
referred
to
the
secretary
for
her
determination.
and,
on
january
15th,
effective
january
20,
1954,
he
was
dismissed
from
his
job.
seven
days
after
the
effective
date
of
his
dismissal,
mr.
cole's
counsel
wrote
a
letter
to
the
secretary
which
requested
a
reopening
of
his
case.
and,
although
mr.
cole
offered
to
prove
that
he
had
not
knowingly
maintained
any
association
with
any
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
his
relationship
with
the
nature
friends
of
america
was
completely
casual
and
entirely
innocent,
that
he
had
specifically
refused
to
become
a
member
of
that
organization,
at
the
--
that
the
only
donations
he
had
ever
made
to
it
were
$2
for
firewood
that
he
had
used
at
one
time
on
a
camping
trip,
the
secretary
refused
him
permission
to
reopen
the
case
and
to
have
a
hearing.
and,
when
she
did
that,
she
stated
that
she
had
considered
this
information,
as
well
as
other
information.
on
february
10th,
1954,
counsel
requested
reconsideration
of
the
denial
of
the
right
to
reopen
and
claimed
the
violation
of
the
veterans'
preference
act
and
invalidity
of
the
particular
charges
and
the
executive
order,
but
the
request
for
reconsideration
was
denied.
the
next
day,
mr.
cole
appealed
to
the
united
states
civil
service
commission
not
only
from
the
original
dismissal
action,
but
from
the
two
subsequent
adverse
determinations
as
well.
and,
he
contended
that
all
three
were
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
section
14
of
the
veterans'
preference
act.
now,
on
march
3rd,
1954,
the
regional
civil
service
commission
refused
jurisdiction
of
mr.
cole's
appeal
from
any
of
the
three
adverse
determinations
on
the
ground
that
public
law
733,
as
extended
to
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
by
executive
order
10450,
had
cut
off
his
otherwise
mandatory
right
of
appeal
as
a
veterans'
preference
eligible,
under
the
veterans'
preference
act,
to
the
commission.
now,
on
may
5,
1954,
united
states
civil
service
commission
in
washington,
to
which
the
regional
commissioner's
ruling
had
been
appealed,
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
regional
commission
and,
three
weeks
thereafter,
this
action
was
instituted
in
the
district
court.
now,
public
law
733
provides
in
substance,
basically,
that
certain
named
agency
heads,
i
think
approximately
ten
agencies
originally
dealing
with
national
defense,
may
similarly
suspend
and,
thereafter,
terminate
employees
in
their
absolute
discretion
when
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
when
they
deem
employees
to
be
security
risks,
but
an
employee
who
is
not
disloyal,
who
has
no
access
to
classified
material
or
government
secrets
of
any
kind,
who
is
not
a
policy
maker,
who
is
not
employed
in
an
agency
whose
functions
bear
no
relationship
to
this
nation's
defense,
foreign
relations,
or
preparedness
programs
cannot
be
dismissed
under
the
statute
because
his
dismissal
cannot
be
justified
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
in
other
words,
he
is
not
a
security
risk.
we
do
not
merely
rely
on
a
definition
of
the
statutory
term
“the
interest
of
the
national
security,”
a
term
which
certainly
is
not
free
from
vagueness
and
a
term
under
which
the
allowable
area
of
executive
discretion
is
quite
large.
but,
we
say
that
that
term
has
limits,
some
limits
somewhere
and
that
this,
certainly,
is
a
case
beyond
those
limits.
respondents
say
otherwise.
they
say
it's
without
any
limits
whatever.
and,
for
this,
we
rely
on
the
statute
primarily
which,
itself,
provides
for
the
reemployment
of
discharged
employees
in
nonsensitive
agencies
and
positions
but,
unmistakably
also,
we
rely
on
the
clearly
expressed
purpose
and
intent
of
the
congress
in
enacting
this
legislation.
that
purpose
was
to
provide
a
permanent
legislative
authority
for
the
summary
termination
of
employees
whose
character
and
associations,
when
considered
in
relation
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
particular
type
of
work
they
were
doing,
made
it
necessary
or
advisable
that
they
could
not
continue
to
hold
down
jobs
which
were
vitally
involved
in
our
defense
and
preparedness
programs.
that
was
the
expressed
congressional
purpose
behind
public
law
733.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
it
is
in
senate
report
2158
which
is
the
senate
committee
report
of
the
armed
services
committee.
that
report
is
--
that
statement
of
the
act's
purpose
is
contained
both
in
the
senate
report
and
in
house
report
2230,
which
is
the
companion
house
report
on
this
particular
act,
both
made
in
1950.
that
statutory
purpose
was
so
understood
by
the
executive
branch
prior
to
the
issuance
of
executive
order
10450,
the
executive
order
under
attack
here.
and,
it
was
understood
by
legal
--
leading
authorities
in
the
field,
and
we've
set
them
forth
in
our
brief.
judicial
authorities
in
cases
decided
under
comparable
security
programs
have
similarly
defined
the
term,
“the
interest
of
the
national
security.”
and,
the
term
was
defined
in
the
way
that
petitioner
defines
it,
by
the
national
security
council's
interdepartmental
committee
on
internal
security
whose
report,
in
1952,
on
the
government
employee
security
program
is
set
forth
in
relevant
parts
in
appendix
b
of
our
main
brief.
all
of
these
authorities
define
the
interest
of
the
national
security
solely
in
relation
to
those
specific
matters
which
vitally
affect
this
nation's
military,
preparedness,
and
foreign
relations
programs.
all
of
the
authorities
are
in
complete
agreement
that
the
term
has
absolutely
no
relationship
to,
and
definitely
excludes,
those
programs
and
functions
of
government
which,
while
intimately
connected
with
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
the
country's
people,
are
not
directly
related
to
those
programs
and
functions
of
government
intimately
and
directly
related
to
the
national
safety.
now,
mr.
cole's
job
bears
as
much
relationship
to
the
national
safety,
this
job
of
food
and
drug
inspector,
as
does
the
job
of
any
butcher
in
any
meat
cutting
plant,
of
any
baker
in
any
bakery,
or
of
a
leaf
raker
out
on
the
lawn.
and,
if
this
was
what
was
meant
by
congress
when
it
enacted
this
particular
statute,
we
think
the
statute
was
meaningless
because
the
result
that
respondents
claim
that
congress
intended
could
have
been
achieved
in
much
more
simply
than
by
this
statute
merely
by
repealing
each
and
every
one
of
the
civil
service
statues
on
the
federal
statute
clause.
since
mr.
cole
had
no
access
to
any
classified
information
or
government
secrets,
any
associations
he
might
have
with
alleged
subversives
could
not
conceivably
have
resulted
even
in
his
inadvertent
disclosure
of
classified
information
of
government
secrets
because
he
didn't
have
any
access
to
any
such
material.
and,
a
graphic
example
of
this
is
contained
in
this
kind
of
situation
even
if
we
were
to
assume
that
mr.
cole
had
a
communist
wife,
and
by
the
way
he
is
a
bachelor,
the
fact
that
he
might
talk
in
his
sleep
would
cause
to
be
revealed
only
nonsensitive,
non-classified,
non-secret
information,
information
available
at
any
public
library
of
the
united
states.
since
he
is
not
charged
with
disloyalty,
by
very
definition
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
ex
parte
mitsuye
endo,
he
cannot
be
deemed
a
potential
saboteur
of
the
food
supply,
so
that
we
have
in
this
case
neither
potential
espionage,
nor
potential
sabotage,
nor
potential
even
inadvertent
disclosure
of
classified
or
secret
information.
thus,
we
don't
think
that
the
respondents
can
seriously
argue
to
this
court
that
mr.
cole's
discharge
can
be
justified
in
the
statutory
interest,
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
we
are
not
saying
that
mr.
cole
could
not
ever
be
discharged.
what
we
are
saying
is
simply
this.
even
if
we
assume
that
the
president
could
validly
have
extended
the
statute
to
each
and
every
agency
of
the
government,
former
secretary
hobby,
secretary
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
could
not
validly
have
dismissed
mr.
cole
under
this
statute
on
these
conceded
facts.
that's
our
first
argument.
perhaps
an
even
stronger
argument
is
contained
right
in
section
3
of
the
statute
which
authorize
the
president
to
extend,
as
i
said
before,
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
law
to
such
other
departments
and
agencies
of
the
government
as
he
might
selectively,
from
time
to
time,
deem
necessary
in
the
best
interest
of
the
national
security.
and,
in
april
of
1953,
the
president
did
issue
executive
order
10450
which
not
only
extended
this
particular
statute
to
each
and
every
agency
and
department
of
the
government,
but
it
extended
it
to
each
and
every
employee
in
each
and
every
agency,
no
matter
how
sensitive
or
non-sensitive
the
job
held
by
that
employee.
and,
this
extension
was
coupled
with
a
mandatory
direction
to
each
and
every
agency
head
requiring
them
to
judge
each
and
every
employee
under
their
supervision
and
control
by
the
same
mutually
consistent
and
no
less
than
minimum
standard
that
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security
standard.
at
the
same
time,
the
president
revoked
the
loyalty
program
which
had
been
established
by
executive
order
9835
and
which
was
under
consideration
by
this
court
in
peters
against
hobby.
now,
under
9835,
employees
had
been
permitted
to
appeal
from
the
adverse
decision
to
a
special
independent
review
authority
in
the
united
states
civil
service
commission.
however,
under
public
rule
of
733,
an
agency
head's
determination
is
final
and
the
employee
cannot
appeal
where
the
statute,
of
course,
is
validly
applied.
now,
under
public
rule
of
733,
an
examination
of
the
statute
discloses
that
congress
vested
discretion
in
agency
and
department
heads
to
determine
which
positions
within
their
particular
departments
and
agencies
would
have
been
covered
under
the
law.
congress
also
vested
them
with
discretion
to
dismiss
employees
when
the
particular
agency
head
concerned
deemed
it
necessary
or
advisable,
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security,
that
those
employees
be
dismissed.
and,
congress
also
vested
them
with
discretion
to
reinstatement,
suspended
employees
to
duty
not
only
to
the
position
from
which
they
had
been
suspended,
but
to
some,
perhaps,
less
sensitive
position
within
the
particular
agency.
however,
let's
examine
the
executive
order
now.
under
its
mandatory
provisions,
the
statutory
discretion
to
determine
which
positions
within
a
particular
agency
are
to
be
covered
under
the
act
and
which
are
not
has
now
been
effectively
divested
by
the
requirement
of
the
executive
order
that
all
positions
within
a
particular
agency,
including
the
position
of
washroom
attendant
at
a
branch
post
office,
must
be
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security
of
the
united
states.
under
the
executive
order,
an
agency
has
--
no
longer
has
discretion
to
determine
that
it
is
necessary
or
advisable
to
dismiss
employee
jones.
he
must
dismiss
employee
jones
unless
he
can
affirmatively
establish
that
employee
jones'
continued
employment
is
clearly
consistent
with
national
security.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
it
does.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
because,
your
honor,
what
he
did
was
this.
it
changed
the
--
it
changed
--
i
think
i
should
make
this
clear.
the
necessary
or
advisable
standard
used
by
congress
in
the
statute
is
used
in
two
senses.
it
is
a
standard
of
application
or
of
coverage
in
terms
of
the
statutory
application
by
the
agency
and
of
the
statute
within
his
particular
agency
or
department.
it
is
also
a
standard
of
termination
and
retention,
and
the
same
standard
is
used
in
two
different
ways.
now,
it
destroyed
his
discretion,
the
agency
has
the
discretion
in
terms
of
the
application
of
the
statute
because,
under
the
executive
order,
he
no
longer
has
the
discretion
to
determine
where
it
--
the
extent
to
which
it
shall
be
applied
within
his
own
particular
agency
or
department.
he's
got
to
apply
it
straight
down
the
line
throughout
his
particular
department.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
he
had
the
authority
to
apply
it
only
where
he
deemed
it
necessary
to
apply
it
in
the
national
security
interest.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
he
does
not.
he
must
apply
it
under
the
executive
order.
each
and
every
employee
under
the
executive
order
it
must
be
applied
to.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i'd
like
to
make
that
clear,
sir,
because
i
think
it
is
an
important
point.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
under
the
executive
order,
as
we
will
interpret
it,
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
justice
reed,
that
you'll
see
that
it
is
--
it
must
mandatorily
be
applied.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct.
it
may
be
applied
in
the
discretion
of
the
agency
head.
now,
the
agency
head
hasn't
got
any
discretion
to
say
that
a
leaf
raker
shouldn't
come
within
the
particular
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
leaf
raker,
by
very
perforce
by
the
executive
order,
is
covered
under
the
statute
and
there
isn't
any
question
about
it
anymore.
now,
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
standards
--
the
difference
in
the
standards,
there
is
clearly
consistent
standard
as
contrasted
with
the
necessary
or
advisable
standards.
it
was
also
used
by
congress
and
by
the
executive
order
as
a
standard
of
termination
because
the
agency
had,
when
it
comes
time
to
decide
whether
the
suspended
employee
shall
be
reinstated
to
the
suspended
position
or
dropped
from
his
particular
position,
he
must
find
as
an
affirmative
proposition
not
that
it
is
necessary
or
advisable
that
this
employee
should
be
dismissed
or
discharged,
but
that
he
must
be
discharged
unless
he
can't
affirmatively
find
that
his
continued
employment
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
national
security.
and,
as
approved
by
the
court
below
in
this
case,
that
standard
means,
without
doubt,
real
or
fancy,
of
any
kind.
and,
we
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference
and
i
think
that's
established
by
the
facts
because
employees
who
have
been
cleared,
under
the
necessary
or
advisable
standard,
have
been
dismissed
under
the
clearly
consistent
standard.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
same
employees,
your
honor,
have
been
--
have
gone
through
the
same
proceedings
four
times
under
the
various
changes
in
standards
and
under
the
clearly
consistent
standard,
although
they
have
been
retained
under
all
of
the
others,
they
have
been
dismissed.
we
think
that
hardly
anyone,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
can
meet
the
really
consistent
test.
and,
we
don't
think
many
well-known
individuals
of
questioned
integrity,
honesty,
and
loyalty
can
meet
it
if
only
because
they
were
charged
with
having
flirted
with
the
economic
concepts
of
karl
marx
in
their
college
days.
and,
we
think
that
actual
examples
of
such
situations
were
submitted
to
this
court
in
the
amicus
brief
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union
in
the
case
of
peters
against
hobby.
now,
such
a
person
--
such
a
person
who
is
accused
of
flirting
with
the
economic
principles
of
karl
marx
in
college
days
was
a
post
office
clerk
or
a
food
and
drug
inspector
like
mr.
cole
or
claims
examiner
in
the
veterans'
administration.
the
heads
of
those
departments
would
be
virtually
required
to
dismiss
him
unless
he
was
able
to
completely
overcome
the
presumption
of
guilt
which
this
particular
executive
order
places
upon
the
employee.
that
is
the
basic
change
in
the
standard,
the
tremendous
presumption
of
guilt
which
the
employee
is
faced
with.
he
is
required
to
show,
as
an
affirmative
proposition,
once
the
derogatory
information
is
in
his
file,
that
his
continued
retention
in
the
job
that
he
holds
is
clearly
consistent
with
national
security.
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
believe
that
may
be
so,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
think
that,
under
the
executive
order,
this
is
clear
because
the
department
heads
cannot
consider
the
non-sensitivity
of
the
employment
where
the
charges
relate
to
political
factors,
what
respondents
call
“subversion,”
as
distinct
from
charges
related,
for
example,
to
alcoholism
or
drug
addiction.
now,
i
think
a
comparison
of
the
standards
and
criteria
of
the
executive
order
clearly
discloses
this
fact.
in
section
8
(a)(1)
of
the
executive
order,
which
relates
to
what
the
government
calls
“suitability
factors,”
the
agency
head
has
the
authority
under
the
executive
order
to
consider
the
seriousness
of
the
charge
in
relationship
to
the
sensitivity
of
the
employee's
work.
but,
under
sections
8
(a)(2)
through
(8)
of
the
executive
order,
which
relate
to
the
so-called
subversion
factors,
the
agency
head
cannot
consider
the
sensitivity
of
the
employee's
work
only
in
connection
with
the
seriousness
of
the
charges.
the
charges
are
considered
to
be
derogatory
in
the
absolute
sense
and
the
employee
must,
in
order
to
establish
this
--
that
his
retention
is
clearly
consistent,
he
must
completely
overcome
by
independent
and
affirmative
evidence
of
the
entire
man
that
he
is
that,
notwithstanding
these
charges,
he
nevertheless
must
be
retained.
that,
the
national
security
interest
would
definitely
be
hurt
if
he
was
fired,
and
that's
the
burden
that
this
executive
order
placed
on
mr.
cole.
now,
i
think
i
must
point
to
this
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
--
because
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
we
have
that
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
that's
our
hurdle
and
i
think
we
have
come
over
it.
i'd
like
to
point
this
out,
and
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
because
i
think
this
is
decisive,
and
i
think
it's
directly
related
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
if
you
will
compare
section
6
of
the
executive
order
with
section
7
of
the
executive
order,
section
6
follows
virtually
in
haec
verba
the
standards
of
the
statute.
section
7
establishes
the
clearly
consistent
standard
with
terminations.
now,
section
6
of
the
executive
order
relates
only
to
suspensions,
not
to
retention
or
termination
once
an
employee
has
been
suspended.
and,
although
the
respondent
say
that
ours
was
a
case
which
had
to
do
with
suspension,
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
it
has
to
do
with
termination
because
we
don't
complain
about
the
suspension
in
this
case.
we
complain
about
mr.
cole's
termination
effective
january
20.
whenever
the
statute
is
followed
by
the
executive
order,
the
agency
head
has
discretion,
as
in
the
case
of
suspensions
where
section
6
applies,
to
weigh
the
relationship
between
the
sensitivity
of
the
work
and
the
seriousness
of
the
charges.
but,
when
it
comes
to
section
7
of
the
executive
order,
which
follows
the
clearly
consistent
standard
and
not
the
necessary
or
advisable
standard
as
does
section
6,
there,
the
agency
head
does
not
have
discretion
to
weigh
the
sensitivity
of
the
work
in
relationship
to
the
seriousness
of
the
charges
except
in
one
kind
of
case,
and
that's
the
8
(a)(1)
case
which
deals
primarily
with
employee
suitability,
drug
addiction,
alcoholism,
and
the
like,
but
not
with
subversion.
so,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
mr.
cole
could
not
be
dismissed
as
a
security
risk
because
he
had
no
access
to
any
security
material.
he
could
not
be
dismissed
as
disloyal
because
the
government
concedes
that
he
is
loyal.
he
was
dismissed
because
he
is
a
new
creature,
a
new
creature
created
solely
and
exclusively
by
this
executive
order.
he's
a
non-disloyal
subversive
and
the
executive
order
proposed
the
continued
employment
of
all
non-disloyal
subversives,
even
from
the
job
of
porter
in
the
branch
post
office.
that's
what
this
executive
order
does
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
we
think
clearly,
therefore,
that
mr.
cole
was
not
fired
under
the
standards
established
by
the
congress
and
the
record,
that's
page
21
of
the
record,
clearly
shows
that
mrs.
hobby
dismissed
him
under
the
clearly
consistent
standard
because
she
said,
“i
have
determined
that
your
continued
retention
in
employment
is
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security.”
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
now,
in
establishing
this
clearly
consistent
standard,
rather
than
the
necessary
or
advisable
one,
we
think
that
the
president
clearly
exceeded
the
power
which
was
granted
him
under
section
3
of
public
law
733.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
clear
that
we
do
not
attack
the
power
of
the
congress
to
enact
a
statute
worded
in
the
manner
of
this
executive
order
but,
merely,
the
attempt
of
the
president
to
substitute
his
own
standards
for
those
of
the
congress.
and,
we
say
that
the
fact
of
the
president's
lack
of
power
cannot
be
dispelled
as
the
respondents
would
have
this
court
do
by
leaning
on
the
president's
removal
power
absent
congressional
limitations
on
those
powers
because,
here,
we
say
that
congress
has
validly
restricted
the
president's
removable
power
in
the
lloyd-lafollette
and
veterans'
preference
acts,
and
in
public
law
733
itself,
which
we
say
carves
out
an
area
of
exception
to
these
otherwise
valid
restrictions,
the
lloyd-lafollette
and
veterans'
preference
act.
and,
we
say
the
boundary
lines
of
that
area
of
exception
are
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
national
security
and,
on
these
facts,
this
is
a
case
which
is
clearly
beyond
those
limits.
now
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
section
3
of
public
law
733.
your
honor
will
find
it
at
appendix
a,
page
54
of
our
main
brief,
5
united
states
code
section
22-3,
and
i
will
read
it
to
your
honor.
it
says,
“the
provisions
of
sections
22-1
to
22-3
of
this
title
shall
apply
to
such
other
departments
and
agencies
of
the
government
as
the
president
may,
from
time
to
time,
deem
necessary
in
the
best
interest
of
national
security.”
and
then,
it
goes
on
to
say
“if
any
departments
or
agencies
are
included
to
the
--
by
the
president,
they
must
so
be
reported
to
the
senate
armed
services
committee.
now,
under
the
standard
of
the
executive
order,
but
not
under
the
standard
of
the
statute,
all
doubts
must
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
government.
and,
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
mr.
cole's
case
for,
even
though
his
discharge
was
arbitrary
by
test
of
this
statute,
it
was
virtually
commanded
by
test
to
the
executive
order.
we
have
contended
also
that
the
notice
of
dismissal
was
not
a
written
statement
of
the
decision
that
the
agency
had,
but
we
feel
that
matter
is
fully
covered
in
our
briefs
and
we
will
not
go
into
it
in
oral
argument.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
there
were
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
sir,
there
were
five
charges
against
him,
and
i
can
read
them.
one,
that
you
established
and
have
continued
a
close
association
with
individuals
who
reliably
reported
to
be
communists.
two,
that
you
have
maintained
a
continued
in
sympathetic
association
with
the
nature
friends
of
america,
which
organization
has
been
cited
by
the
attorney
general
under
the
provisions
of
executive
order
10450.
that
you
have,
by
your
own
admission
donated
funds
to
the
nature
friends
of
america
that
was
$2.
four,
that
you
have
contributed
your
services
in
the
form
of
work
to
the
nature
friends
of
america.
five,
that
you
have
attended
social
gatherings
of
the
nature
friends
of
america.
and,
in
attempting
to
reopen
his
case,
mr.
cole
pointed
out
that
the
work
that
he
supposedly
did
for
this
organization
was
to
blaze
trails
in
connection
with
his
hobby
of
hiking
and
camping,
that
the
form
of
money
he
contributed
was
the
sum
of
$2
for
firewood
that
he
had
used,
and
that
the
parties
or
social
gatherings
that
he
had
attended
were
three
beer
parties
or
two
beer
parties
and
one
dance
which
were
held
by
some
friends
of
his
under
the
auspices
of
this
organization.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
she
did
not.
she
said,
pursuant
to
this
letter
of
january
15th,
that
in
reply
to
the
charges
and
the
letter
which
he
said
he
did
not
answer
them
because
he
deemed
them
to
be
a
violation
of
his
right
to
freedom
of
association,
she
referred
to
that
letter
of
his.
and
then,
she
said
that,
based
on
these
documents
and
other
documents,
of
course
we
don't
know
what
these
other
documents
are,
his
continued
retention
in
employment
was
deemed
to
be
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security,
and
he
was
terminated.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
with
--
may
i
ask
if
your
honor's
question
is
directed
to
the
written
statement
of
the
agency
head
question
or
with
respect
to
the
other
two
issues
that
we
--
we
are
asserting
here.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
with
respect
to
the
written
statement
of
the
decision
of
the
agency
head,
we
say
that
that
term
as
used
by
congress
means
that
the
agency
head
must
give
the
employee
the
reasons,
the
findings
for
his
dismissal.
she
must
find
which
of
the
charges,
if
any,
in
her
own
mind,
were
substantiated
by
whatever
evidence
she
had.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
something
in
the
nature
of
administrative
findings
and
in
terms
of
her
own
determination
upon
the
kind
of
review
that
she
established
within
her
own
department.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
there
is,
and
he
was
offered
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
merely
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
only
statement
is
a
statement
of
the
result,
not
the
reasons
for
the
result.
just
this
naked
result,
either
your
retention
is
deemed
to
be
clearly
consistent
or
that
your
retention
is
being
not
to
be
clearly
consistent.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
we
do
not.
we
do
not.
we
only
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
he
raised
the
constitutional
issue
in
terms
of
his
basic
inherent
right
of
freedom
of
association.
he
did
raise
that
issue
in
his
letter
which
he
said
he
refused
to
answer
these
charges
because
he
said
he
didn't
think,
since
he
was
not
accused
of
being
disloyal,
that
the
government
had
any
right
to
go
into
his
private
life
and
ask
him
any
questions
about
his
friends
and,
therefore,
he
would
continue
to
associate
with
whom
he
pleased.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
think
that
would
be
true.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
question
about
it.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
not
--
not
this
issue.
i
would
say
that
it
turns
--
i
think,
basically,
that
what
the
entire
case
turns
on
is
rather
a
simple
kind
of
issue
and
it
boils
down
to
this.
we
are
concerned
only
with
the
application
of
this
particular
statute
to
this
particular
employee
on
these
particular
conceded
facts
and
we
say
that,
on
these
conceded
facts,
this
employee
could
not
conceivably
have
been
dismissed
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security
of
the
united
states.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
if
he
associated
with
communists,
he
could
be
removed
at
any
time,
perhaps
as
an
unsuitable
employee,
under
the
lloyd-lafollette
or
veterans'
preference
act,
but
not
in
the
interest
of
security.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
where
he
holds
a
position
where
he
has
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
--
absolutely
no
access
to
any
kind
of
security
information.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
right,
sir.
that's
our
position.
that's
what
we
think
the
basic
issue
is.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
but,
in
one
respect,
i
think
that
you
have
stated
it
inaccurately,
sir,
in
that
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
--
in
this
respect.
we
say
that
the
president,
conceivably,
could
have
extended
it
to
every
agency
of
the
government
because,
for
example,
that
the
battle
monument's
commission,
while
there
may
not
be
any
security
interest
there
at
the
present
time
in
any
job,
it
may
conceivably
occur
at
sometime
in
the
future
that
one
job
at
battle
monument's
commission
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
that's
the
issue.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
would
think
that
would
be
an
accurate
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
--
statement,
yes,
sir.
i
would
like,
with
respect
to
this,
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
--
just,
if
i
might
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
i
can
do
it
by
referring
to
this,
if
i
might.
if
your
honors
would
look
at
pages
63
to
65
of
the
respondent's
brief,
you
will
see
that
they
have
set
forth
certain
hypotheticals
which
they
claim
would
justify
mr.
cole's
discharge
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
and,
i
think
i
am
hitting
the
question
that
you
are
raising,
sir.
they
set
forth
these
hypotheticals,
one
of
which
says,
if
i
recall,
that
association
with
communists
might
sow
the
seeds
of
disloyalty
in
him.
well,
our
ambassador
to
russia
associates
with
communists
everyday
and
there
is
no
assumption
that
he
would
be
treated
in
this
manner
because
we
think
that
this,
basically,
is
the
focal
point
of
this
entire
case.
and,
these
hypotheticals
set
forth
in
their
brief
annunciate
the
concept
of
total
security.
total
security
is
a
totalitarian
and
police
state
doctrine.
the
interest
of
the
national
security
of
this
country
weighs
the
rights
of
the
individuals
in
relationship
to
the
safety
of
the
state.
this
statute
talks
about
the
national
security
interests
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
not
the
national
security
interests
of
some
totalitarian
nation.
and,
that,
i
think,
your
honor,
is
the
answer
to
that
question
because
unless
it
weighs
the
rights
of
individuals
in
relationship
to
the
safety
of
the
state,
we
no
longer
can,
at
any
point,
say
that
any
kind
of
job,
any
kind
of
employment,
even
life
itself
anywhere
in
the
confine
--
the
geographic
confines
of
this
country
is
not
invested
with
some
security
interest.
somewhere,
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
and,
on
these
conceded
facts,
in
weighing
and
making
that
balance,
it
must
be
drawn
here
because
this
is
a
case
completely
outside
the
scope
of
the
limits
of
the
intention
of
the
congress
and
the
statutory
purpose
and
the
statute
itself.
that's
our
case.
i'd
like
to
save
whatever
time
i
might
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
thank
you.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
about
an
interpretive
bulletin,
i
should
like
to
call
your
honor's
attention
to
united
states
civil
service
commission's
guides
for
members
of
security
hearing
boards
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
at
page
19
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
number
in203,
july
1953,
which
provides,
“the
executive
order
further
provides
that
the
head
of
each
agency
shall
suspend
and
terminate
in
accordance
with
the
act
of
august
26,
1950
the
employment
of
any
person
whose
retention
in
employment
would
not,
under
the
standards
of
executive
order
10450,
be
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
national
security.”
your
honors,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
respondent's
appendix
wherein
they
set
forth
completely
executive
order
10450,
page
5
(a)
of
that
appendix
where
they
set
forth
section
2
of
the
executive
order.
and,
when
they
say,
as
my
learned
adversary
has
said,
that
mr.
cole
was
dismissed
under
section
6
of
the
executive
order,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
so
because,
on
page
5
(a),
we
have
section
2
of
the
executive
order
which
provides
that
the
head
of
the
each
department
and
agency
of
the
government
shall
be
responsible
for
establishing
and
maintaining
within
his
department
or
agency
an
effective
program
to
ensure
that
the
employment
and
retention
in
employment
of
any
civilian
officer
or
employee
within
the
department
or
agency
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
let's
then
go
over
to
9
(a),
excuse
me,
your
honors,
8
(a)
and
9
(a)
of
their
appendix.
and,
if
we
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
page
8
(a),
we
see
section
7
which
reads,
and
this
i
think
is
crucial,
“any
person
whose
employment
is
suspended,
not
terminated
yet,
but
suspended,”
as
was
mr.
cole,
“or
terminated
under
the
authority
granted
to
heads
of
departments
and
agencies,
by
or
in
accordance
with
said
act
of
august
26,
1950
or
pursuant
to
executive
order
9835
or
any
other
security
or
loyalty
program
relating
to
officers
or
employees
of
the
government,
shall
not
be
reinstated,”
that
means
from
the
position
from
which
the
employee
was
suspended,
“or
restored,”
that
means
from
the
position
from
which
the
employee
had
been
terminated
as
distinguished
from
suspension,
“to
duty
or
reemployed
in
the
same
department
or
agency
and
shall
not
be
reemployed
in
any
other
department
or
agency
unless
the
head
of
the
agency
--
of
the
department
or
agency
concerned
finds
that
such
reinstatement,
restoration,
or
reemployment
is
clearly
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
national
security,
etcetera.”
i
think,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
will
think,
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
language
of
the
executive
order
itself,
it
is
section
7
of
this
order
and
not
section
6
which
is
the
basis
for
the
determination
that
mr.
cole's
continued
employment
was
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
and,
page
21
of
the
record
clearly
establishes
that
fact.
the
secretary
never
made
a
determination
that
mr.
cole's
continued
employment
was
neither
necessary
nor
advisable
in
the
national
security
interest.
she
made
a
determination
that
his
continued
retention
in
employment
was
not
clearly
consistent
with
that
security
interest.
and,
that
your
honors,
is
the
crucial
standard
upon
which
mr.
cole's
termination
was
based.
it
was
not
contained
in
section
6
of
the
order
but
was
contained
directly
in
section
7.
we
think
that
the
guides
for
members
of
security
hearing
board,
established
by
the
united
states
civil
service
commission,
a
commission
which
certainly
is
supposed
to
be
the
expert
body
in
this
field
with
respect
to
this
particular
business,
has
said
and
interpreted
this
executive
order
as
saying
“yes,
when
a
man
is
suspended
he
must
be
suspended
but,
thereafter,
terminated
under
the
clearly
consistent
standard
of
the
provisions
of
the
executive
order
and
not
under
the
necessary
or
advisable
standards
established
by
the
congress.”
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
i
don't
think
that
we
have,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
i
can
tell
you
that,
under
the
executive
order
itself,
employees
have
been
rescreened
pursuant
to,
i
believe,
provision
4
section
4,
stated
on
page
7
(a),
which
says
that
the
head
of
each
department
and
agency
shall
cause
to
rescreen
employees
with
respect
to
whom
there
has
been
a
full-field
investigation
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
there
was
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir,
but
the
order
involved
in
that
case
was
9835
and
he
was
rescreened
by
virtue
of
the
action
of
the
loyalty
review
board
which
took
upon
itself
authority
to
rescreen
even
after
the
agency
had
it
determined
that
the
employee
was
loyal,
and
they
--
they
--
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
that
at
least
is
not
my
understanding
of
the
case.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
it
may
be
the
statutory
one,
for
all
i
know,
but
we
have
never
been
able
to
find
a
standard
commensurate
with
the
one
established
under
this
particular
order.
but,
i
have
never
been
able
to
see
one
and
i
have
never
seen
any
that
i
know
off.
i
should
only
like
to
point
this
out.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
your
honor,
they
weren't
the
same.
they
--
this
new
standard
was
a
much
more
difficult
one.
the
standards
established
under
executive
order
9835,
as
originally
enacted,
provided
for
one
type
of
proof
in
terms
of
disloyalty.
then,
it
was
changed
by
order
of
president
truman
to
read
that
no
employee
shall
be
retained
if
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
his
loyalty.
and
then,
executive
order
10450
came
along
with
respect
to
each
and
every
employee,
even
those
who
had
been
cleared
under
both
standards
of
executive
order
9835,
the
original
one
and
the
more
stringent
one.
and,
employees
have
been
terminated
after
they
had
been
twice
cleared
before
under
the
clearly
consistent
standard.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir.
i
have
not
seen
any,
nor
do
i
know
of
any.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
what
it
means
is
this.
it
means
that
anyone
who
had
a
full-field
investigation
under
executive
order
9835
was
to
have
his
case
re-adjudicated
under
the
clearly
consistent
standard
of
executive
order
10450.
and,
if
the
agency
had,
by
following
the
provisions
of
section
6
of
the
order
which
was
taking
to
consideration
the
sensitivity
of
the
employee's
position,
that
employ
was
to
be
suspended.
once
he
was
suspended
or
once
he
was
transferred
under
section
6,
which
was
permissible,
then
the
agency
head
would
have
to
make
a
determination
under
the
provisions
of
the
executive
order,
the
winning
question,
10450,
whether
or
not
that
employee's
termination
or
retention,
whether
that
employee's
retention
in
the
particular
job
was
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
and,
that
goes
for
any
job
which
the
employee
might
have
held.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
the
old
executive
order,
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
april
26.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
well,
i
think
that
what
happened
there
was
under
4
--
under
section
4.
what
happened
was
that
they
said
anyone
who
had
--
had
a
full-field
investigation
under
9835
had
to
be
judged
under
the
clearly
consistent
standard
and
re-adjudicated
under
the
clearly
consistent
standard
of
the
executive
order,
and
that
interpretation
is
so
set
forth
in
the
united
states
civil
service
commission
guides
for
members
of
security
hearing
boards
where
they
so
state
that,
with
reference
to
the
material
set
forth
on
pages
19
and
20
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
david
i.
shapiro
yes,
sir.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
