mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
will
have
observed,
i
believe,
that
petitioner's
argument
depends
largely
upon
the
reiteration
of
a
series
of
catch
phrases
like
security
risk,
access
to
classified
information.
he
even
has
a
loyal
subversive
catch
phrase.
the
significant
fact
is
that
none
of
those
phrases,
with
which
he
weaves
his
argument,
is
to
be
found
in
the
statute
involved.
i
think,
in
considering
the
first
question
as
to
the
permissible
reach
of
the
statute,
it
may
be
well
to
devote
a
minute
to
consider
the
situation
which
existed
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
prior
to
its
enactment.
at
that
time,
there
were
enforced
two
or
three
special
statutes
limited
to
the
navy,
the
army,
and
the
coast
guard
which
gave
the
heads
of
those
agencies
summary
dismissal
power
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
those
are
not
the
precise
words
of
those
statutes
but
in
substance.
in
addition,
there
was
then
in
effect
a
so-called
government
employees'
loyalty
program
which
have
been
promulgated
in
1947
by
executive
order
9835.
that
program,
beyond
dispute,
was
applicable
to
all
employees
and
officers
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
apparently,
it
was
felt
that
the
legal
authority
then
in
the
possession
of
the
executive
branch,
with
respect
to
dismissal
in
the
security
interest,
was
inadequate.
and,
the
primary
reason
that
that
was
felt
seems
to
have
been
that
there
were
many
people
who
were
not
disloyal
in
the
sense
that
they
had
a
conscious
disattachment
to
the
principles
of
our
constitution,
but
they
may
be
dope
addicts.
they
could
be
drunkards.
they
could
suffer
from
mental
illnesses
or
they
could,
as
mr.
justice
reed
commented,
they
could
be
closely
associated
with
communists.
and,
it
was
felt
that
such
a
person,
although
not
disloyal
in
the
sense
that
i
have
indicated,
nevertheless,
his
presence
in
the
job
is
a
detrimental
factor
to
the
overall
national
security
of
the
united
states.
and,
this
law
was
passed
to
give
the
executive
branch
an
overall
authority
to
deal
with
those
problems.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
the
statute
here
involved
which
we
frequently
refer
to
as
public
law
733.
now,
if
i
may
direct
the
court's
attention
for
a
moment
to
the
exact
language
of
public
law
733.
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioner
has
not
dealt
with
it
as
extensively
as
it
deserves.
it
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
and,
it
starts
out
that,
notwithstanding
the
probations
of
any
other
law,
the
heads
--
the
named
heads
of
11
agencies
navy,
army,
air
force,
justice,
treasury,
commerce,
and
a
few
others,
that
each
such
head
may,
in
his
absolute
discretion
and
when
deemed
necessary
in
the
interest
of
national
security,
suspend
any
civilian
officer
or
employee
of
the
respectively
named
departments.
and
then,
it
goes
on
to
provide
a
procedure
for
the
protection
of
the
employee
following
his
suspension
and
prior
to
his
termination.
the
employee
is
given
a
statement
of
the
charges
with
the
reasons
to
the
extent
that
security
considerations
permit.
he
is
afforded
30
days
within
which
to
answer
the
charges
and
submit
affidavits.
he
is
offered
a
hearing
before
an
agency
board.
following
that
hearing,
his
case
is
then
reviewed
by
either
the
head
of
the
department
or
someone
to
whom
he
has
delegated
that
task.
and,
finally,
the
head
of
the
department
himself
makes
the
final
determination
as
to
whether
the
termination
of
that
employee
is,
in
the
opinion
of
the
agency
--
agency
head,
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
as
the
court
will
have
observed
in
this
case,
petitioner
declined
his
opportunity
for
agency
hearing.
so,
there
is
in
the
record
and
there
can
be
no
questions
as
to
what
information
he
might
have
received
had
he
availed
himself
of
the
tendered
opportunity.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that,
as
to
11
named
agencies
specified
in
the
act
itself,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
act
applies,
as
it
says,
to
any
civilian
officer
and
employee.
in
other
words,
as
to
those
11
agencies,
there
is
no
employee,
how
ever
high
in
hierarchy
or
how
ever
low,
whom
the
agency
head
may
not
investigate
and
consider
whether
or
not
that
person's
service
is
detrimental
to
the
security
interests
of
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no
doubt,
it
is
true
that
those
11
agencies
were
specified
by
congress
because
it
deemed
those
agencies
most
--
the
core
of
national
defense,
if
i
may
so
put
it.
in
other
words,
as
to
those
agencies,
congress
itself
said,
“we
make
the
determination
that
every
officer
and
employee
therein
shall
be
--
must
meet
the
test
that
his
retention
is
consistent
with
the
security
interests
of
the
united
states.”
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
he
is
--
well,
that
is
within
the
discretion
of
the
agency
head.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
there
can
--
i
can't
prognosticate
as
to
what
this
man
might
have
be
given
had
he
asked
for
the
--
for
the
information.
in
other
words,
whether
the
charges
were
based
upon
classified
information
or
whether
there
was
a
neighbor
of
this
man
who
was
prepared
to
testify
to
these
charges,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
the
petitioner
lost
his
opportunity
to
make
whatever
point
that
he
might
have
by
saying,
“i
don't
want
any
hearing.
i
choose
to
associate
with
whom
i
please,
and
that
is
my
inalienable
right.”
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
the
only
thing
that
the
record
discloses
on
that
is
the
fact
that
the
termination
letter
of
the
secretary
did,
in
fact,
point
out
that
petitioner
had
declined
to
reply
to
the
charges.
that's
in
record
page
21,
the
middle
paragraph
of
that
letter.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
you
mean
the
fact
that
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
can
only
interpret
the
language
in
the
secretary's
letter.
and,
to
me,
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
that
letter,
it
does
not
seem
that
the
secretary
was
saying,
as
an
independent
proposition,
your
failure
to
answer
justifies
your
termination.
i
do
not
so
read
the
secretary's
letter.
now,
if
i
may
then
turn
to
the
next
question
as
to
the
permissible
extension
of
the
statute
under
the
discretionary
authority
vested
in
the
president.
that,
of
course,
is
governed
by
section
3
of
the
act
and
that
is
very
short
and
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
page
4
(a).
that
states
that
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
apply
to
such
other
departments
and
agencies
as
the
president
may,
from
time
to
time,
deem
necessary
in
the
best
interest
of
the
national
security.
now,
we
can
read
that
statute
in
no
other
way
than
as
having
congress
saying,
“we
leave
it
to
you,
mr.
president,
with
respect
to
all
agencies
of
the
government
other
than
the
11
which
we
ourselves
have
put
under
this
act.
we
leave
it
to
you,
mr.
president,
to
decide
whether
the
interest
of
the
national
security
require
that
some
or
all
other
agencies
of
the
government
be
placed
under
the
same
provisions
of
the
act.”
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
that
point
was
made
at
the
hearings,
particularly
in
the
senate,
referred
to
in
the
briefs
of
both
parties,
and
some
senator
suggested,
“why
don't
we
just
make
this
act
applicable
to
all
government
agencies?”
and
the
answer
of
the
spokesman
for
the
department
of
defense,
which
was
the
sponsor
of
this
bill,
was
that
you
could
do
that.
but,
i
think
the
better
way
is
to
leave
it
to
the
president's
discretion
because,
at
varying
times,
the
compelling
interest
of
the
national
security
might
be
more
intense
at
one
period
than
another
and
rather
than,
as
i
say,
imposing
this
requirement
throughout
the
entire
executive
branch
as
a
matter
of
permanent
legislation,
which
this
is,
congress
deemed
it
more
appropriate
to
vest
in
the
president,
what
in
our
view
is,
the
complete
discretion
to
decide,
at
any
time,
which
other
agencies
of
the
government
shall
be
subject
to
the
act.
and,
in
order
for
petitioner
to
prevail
here
with
respect
to
the
coverage
of
the
act
to
the
agency,
he
would
have
to
ask
this
court
to
conclude
that
the
president
did
not
have
discretion
under
this
statute
to
deem
it
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security
to
bring
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
under
this
act.
now,
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
by
all
means,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
may
i
reiterate
the
act
says
nothing
about
sensitivity,
but
it
--
the
only
phrase
in
the
act
is
“any
civilian
officer
and
employee,”
and
there
is
a
consideration
which
makes
it
perfectly
plain
to
us
that
“any”
means
“any”
because,
as
i
stated,
the
loyalty
program
under
executive
order
9835,
by
everyone's
concession,
was
applied
to
all
government
employees.
and,
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
it
was
recognized
that,
while
the
department
of
defense
--
its
present
intention
was
to
continue
to
process
the
loyalty
cases
under
executive
order
9835
as
long
as
the
president
might
choose
to
leave
that
order
in
effect.
that
if
9835
were
to
be
terminated,
then
loyalty
cases
would
be
processed
under
this
statute.
and
since,
as
i
have
said,
obviously,
the
loyalty
case
concept
extends
through
the
entire
range
of
a
government
agency
and
it
was
recognized
that
this
statute
could
be
used
for
that
purpose.
it
merely
makes
it
possible
what
is
apparent
from
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
that
any
civilian
officer
or
employee
means
just
what
those
words
say.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
oh,no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
so
construe
it.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
do
not
so
construe
it.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it's
because
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
i
--
i
don't
see
any
point
in
substituting
the
word
“welfare”
for
“security.”
the
statute
says
“security”
and
leaves
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
president
to
determine
what
considerations
of
security
are
applicable
at
a
given
time.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
oh,
i'm
very
sorry.
i
--
i
certainly
would
accept
that
as
a
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
--
no
your
honor.
i
do
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
do
not
reject
your
honor's
statement
that
it
is
not
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
president
may
deem
the
national
security
as
requiring
the
application
of
this
bill
to
all
departments
and
agencies.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
wasn't
aware
that
i
was
making
an
instinctive
reaction
that
there
was
a
difference
between
security
and
welfare.
my
point
was
that,
it
seems
to
me,
the
statute
had
used
the
words
“national
security”
and
has
vested
in
the
president
alone
the
discretion
to
determine,
at
a
given
time,
what
are
the
elements
that
go
into
the
concept
of
national
security.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
think
the
only
restriction
is
that
congress
said,
in
effect,
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
we
trust
the
president
to
decide,
at
a
given
time,
what
the
national
security
requires
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
extension
of
this
statute
to
other
government
agencies
or
departments.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
waterman
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
--
i
agree
with
that.
in
other
words,
i
think
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
petitioner
raises
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes.
now,
the
reason
for
that,
in
first
place,
may
i
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
think
it
is
unfortunate
to
use
the
phrase
“sensitive
position”
here
because
the
statute
doesn't
do
it
and
i
don't
think
congress
intended
to
do
it.
and,
furthermore,
i
don't
think
“sensitive
position”
has
a
precise
meaning
in
the
law.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
would
use
“any
position
which
--
the
incumbent
of
which
may
have
an
effect
upon
the
national
security.”
that's
the
language
that
congress
used.
now,
the
answer
to
your
question
specifically
is
this.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
--
i
would
say
that
when
congress
passed
this
law
in
1950,
at
a
time
when
the
country
was
engaged
in
actual
armed
conflict,
congress
would
have
--
certainly
have
felt
that,
for
a
leaf
raker
to
be
a
communist
or
to
associate
with
communists
or
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
that
the
presence
of
such
a
person
in
a
job
in
the
government,
no
matter
how
humble
it
may
be,
is
detrimental
to
the
national
security.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
doubt
that
congress
had
that
concept.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
precisely,
they
said
“any
civilian,
officer,
or
employee.”
that's
--
that's
the
heart
of
our
argument.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
whom
the
head
of
the
department
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
determines.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it's
not
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
because
there
are,
of
course,
differing
consider
--
security
considerations
and
implications
with
respect
to
different
jobs
in
the
government.
in
other
words,
let's
take
a
case.
it
may
be
far
more
detrimental
to
security
interest
of
the
government
that
we
have
an
atomic
scientist
who
was
a
narcotic
addict
than
it
would
be
if
we
have
an
employee
of
the
national
park
service
who
is
a
narcotic
addict.
now
--
and
then,
this
statute
--
this
provision
of
the
statute
which
was
passed
to
take
care
of
that
provision,
assuming
that
an
atomic
scientist
would
be
willing
to
step
down
into
becoming
an
employee
of
the
park
service,
that
opportunity
at
least
is
tendered
to
the
employee
and
he
might
be
considered
not
a
security
risk
in
the
park
service,
where
as
he
definitely
is
a
security
risk
as
an
atomic
scientist.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
now,
in
the
first
place,
in
your
honor's
hypothetical
proposition,
i
think
it
only
fair
to
assume
that,
i
am
assuming
there
are
leaf
rakers
in
the
government
but,
that
that
man
was
terminated
under
this
statute
because
the
head
of
the
department
made
the
determination
that
the
national
security
required
it.
now,
a
determination
of
such
a
hypothetical
case
may
have
been
on
the
ground
that
he
habitually
associated
with
persons
who
were
striving
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
if
that
were
this
case,
i
confess
i
would
find
it
difficult
to
cite
to
your
honor
at
some
other
position
in
the
government
where
i
could
have
any
assurance
that
the
head
of
that
agency
would
deem
it
appropriate
to
reemploy
the
man.
but,
the
point
is
that,
within
limits,
having
regard
to
the
different
security
considerations
and
risks
involved
in
different
positions
of
the
government,
this
does
give
the
employee
a
chance
if
his
character,
his
habits
are
deemed
such
that
he
cannot
fill
one
position,
nevertheless,
he
can
fill
another
position.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
in
addition
to
the
argument
which
i
have
advanced
that
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
contemplate
the
presidential
authority
to
extend
the
act
throughout
the
entire
executive
branch
of
the
government,
we
think
we
have
here
a
strong
case
of
legislative
ratification
even
if
there
were
initial
doubts
as
to
the
president's
power.

3
of
the
act
provides
that
if
the
president
shall
extend
it
to
other
departments
and
agencies,
he
shall
so
notify
the
armed
services
committees
of
the
house
and
senate.
and
on
the
day
that
the
president
issued
the
executive
order,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
chairman
of
each
of
those
committees.
that
letter
is
not
in
the
record
or
briefs
and,
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i
should
like
to
read
it.
it's
quite
short.
the
president
said,
“i
have,
today,
issued
an
executive
order
entitled
'security
requirements
for
government
employment.'
this
order
extends
the
application
of
the
provisions
of
the
security
act
of
august
26,
1950
to
all
executive
departments
and
agencies
of
the
government
to
which
it
has
not
heretofore
been
applicable.
in
accordance
with
section
3
of
the
act,
i
hereby
notify
the
armed
services
committee
that
i
deem
my
action
necessary
in
the
best
interest
of
national
security.”
so,
congress
was
put
on
notice
in
the
formal
way
contemplated
by
the
statute
itself,
that
the
president
had
construed
his
authority
as
embracing
his
right
to
extend
the
act
to
the
entire
executive
branch.
congress
took
no
action
in
contravention
of
that
information.
furthermore,
as
the
court
well
knows,
this
security
program
has
been
a
matter
of
much
wide
publicity
and
much
public
controversy.
indeed,
there
have
been
two
extensive
investigations
of
the
program
by
committees
of
congress
at
which
lengthy
hearings
were
printed.
in
addition
and
more
specifically,
when
the
1954
appropriation
act
for
the
departments
of
commerce,
justice,
and
state
were
under
consideration,
those
acts
were
reported
out
of
committee
having
in
them
the
so-called
mccarran
rider.
that
was
a
rider
which
had
been
included
since
1946
in
that
appropriation
act
which
gave
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
the
secretary
of
state
the
absolute
discretion
to
dismiss
any
employee
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
in
the
debates
on
this
bill,
public
law
733,
there
was
extensive
discussion
particularly
in
the
house
as
to
the
relationship
between
the
mccarran
rider
authority
and
the
extension
authority
given
under
section
3
of
this
act.
and,
because
it
was
felt
that
the
whole
security
problem
of
the
government
would
be
encompassed
within
this
statute,
the
mccarran
riders
were
stricken
from
the
bill.
so,
taking
all
of
those
factors
into
consideration,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
here
a
plain
case
of
congress
as
having
ratified
the
president's
interpretation
of
the
bill.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
as
to
the
extension.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
yes,
i
should
like
to
take
that
up
right
at
this
point.
in
the
first
place,
the
court
may
be
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
what
the
executive
order
actually
provides,
with
all
due
deference
to
opposing
counsel.
i
think
his
statement
of
that
was
not
entirely
clear.
the
provision
of
the
executive
order
which
governs
the
action
here
taken,
to
wit,
the
termination
of
this
employee
from
his
position
is
section
6,
quoted
in
our
brief
on
appendix,
page
8
(a).
the
court
rule
observed
that
that
provides
that,
if
information
is
developed
indicating
that
the
employment
of
any
officer
or
employee
may
not
be
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
the
national
security,
the
head
of
the
department
may
or
shall
immediately
suspend
the
employment
of
the
person
if
he
deems
such
suspension
necessary
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security.
and,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
that
fact,
the
critical
finding
which
he
must
make
in
order
to
suspend
an
employee,
is
in
the
precise
language
of
the
act
itself.
and
then,
section
6
goes
on
to
say
that,
following
review,
the
head
of
the
agency
shall
terminate
the
employment
of
such
suspended
officer
or
employee
whenever
he
shall
determine
such
termination
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
national
security
in
accordance
with
the
act.
and,
there,
again,
the
executive
order
uses
the
precise
language
of
the
act.
so,
as
we
read
the
executive
order,
with
respect
to
termination
which
is
the
only
executive
act
involved
in
this
case,
there
cannot
be
even
an
argument
that
there
has
been
an
application
of
a
difference
or
a
contrary
standard
from
that
prescribed
by
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
the
finding
is
at
page
--
record
page
21
and
states
it
has
been
determined
that
your
continued
employment
in
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
is
not
clearly
consistent
with
the
interest
of
national
security.
now,
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that
is
not,
your
honor.
that
is
in
the
words
which
are
elsewhere
used
in
the
executive
order.
they
are
used
in
the
preamble
of
the
statute,
they
are
used
in
section
7
of
the
executive
order
which
deals
with
the
conditions
under
which
an
employee
who
has
been
terminated
may
be
reinstated,
and
they
are
also
used
in
section
8
of
the
executive
order
which
sets
forth
various
factors
which
shall
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
investigation
of
an
employee.
now,
your
honor's
question,
i
think,
leads
to
the
issue
raised
by
petitioner
as
to
whether
granting
that
the
secretary
has
used
this
language
clearly
consistent
with
the
national
security
whether
the
secretary
has
used
a
different
standard
or
conflicting
standard
with
that
prescribed
by
the
act.
in
our
view,
it
has
not.
congress
chose
not
to
offer
the
executive
or
the
courts
any
definition
whatever
of
the
phrase
“necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security.”
bearing
in
mind
that
we
are
here
dealing,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
with
the
control
of
the
executive
personnel,
a
function
vested
by
the
constitution
in
the
president,
a
function
perhaps
more
completely
internal
to
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
than
any
other
functions,
we
think
--
and
bearing
in
mind
further
that
the
administration
of
the
act
in
the
sense
of
deciding
the
case
of
a
particular
employee
is
vested
in
cabinet
officers
whose
relationship
to
the
president
is,
of
course,
perfectly
obvious,
bearing
all
of
those
factors
into
account,
we
think
it
would
be
highly
unrealistic
to
construe
this
act
as
meaning
that
congress
meant
that
the
chief
executive
acting
in
this
executive
field
could
not
offer
guidance
and
interpretation
to
his
chief
assistants
in
the
administration
of
the
act.
indeed,
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out,
and
we
agree,
if
the
act
were
otherwise
construed,
we
think
there
would
be
a
constitutional
question
as
to
its
validity
as
infringing
upon
the
president's
executive
power.
we
think
the
act
is
not
to
be
given
such
a
construction.
now,
before
the
recess,
some
comments
were
made
as
to
the
supposed
extreme
difficulty
of
an
employee's
meeting
this
standard.
again,
we
by
no
means
agree
with
the
characterization
of
this
standard
which
has
been
given
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
in
fact,
this
standard
cannot
be
so
difficult
to
apply
or
for
employees
to
pass.
the
truth
is
that
something
over
two
million
government
employees
have
already
passed
the
standard
successfully.
it
--
it
does
not
seem
to
us
that
there,
in
using
the
words
“clearly
consistent
with
the
national
interest,”
even
if,
as
i
say,
that
be
assumed
to
be
applicable
to
the
termination
here,
that
the
president
has
imposed
a
more
onerous
burden.
i
do
not
read
those
words
as
imposing
a
burden
of
proof,
one
way
or
another.
if
the
president
had
never
used
the
words
“clearly
consistent”
and
the
head
of
the
department
in
a
particular
case
was
left
entirely
to
the
discretion
vested
in
him
to
take
action
deemed
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
the
national
security,
i
submit
that
that
department
head
would
be
free
under
that
definition
to
say
“i
shall
determine
that
the
interest
of
national
security
require
that
no
person
will
be
retained
in
my
department
unless
he
convinces
me
by
the
strongest
type
of
evidence
that
his
retention
will
be
consistent
with
the
national
security.”
i
don't
say
that
an
executive
head
did
that.
i
say
that
such
a
standard
could
be
laid
down
by
a
department
head
under
the
general
discretionary
phrase
used
in
the
statute.
so,
i
think
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that,
in
application,
the
use
of
the
clearly
consistent
standard
has
resulted
in
the
imposition
upon
employees
of
a
more
difficult
test
or
more
difficult
burden
of
proof
than
would
have
existed
had
those
words
never
been
used
at
all.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
as
i
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
can
only
consider
that
the
president
conceived
that,
by
using
those
words,
he
was
giving
his
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
to
the
heads
of
the
department.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
not
--
certainly
not
to
burry
it
and
certainly
not
to
impose
any
conditions
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
standard
but,
perhaps,
to
make
it
more
clear.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it's
--
it
was
obviously
a
concern
of
the
president
and
it
is
so
stated
in
the
preamble
of
the
executive
order
that
there
be
a
degree
of
consistency
in
the
administration
of
this
statute
within
the
several
departments
and
agencies.
and,
i
would
concede
that,
just
as
in
the
preamble,
he
laid
down
certain
basic
considerations
which
he
deemed
relevant
to
the
consideration
of
the
problem
by
the
department
head
that
he
deemed
that
he
was
offering
clarifying
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
when
he
used
the
words
“clearly
consistent.”
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
as
any
general,
even
vague,
statutory
phrase,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
always
room
for
executive
interpretation
which
clarifies
the
phrase
for
purposes
of
administration
and,
yet,
by
no
means
imposes
any
standard
or
conditions
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
phrase.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
think
it
adds
a
degree.
it
--
it
--
i
do
not
say
it
adds
a
high
degree
of
precision
to
the
standard.
the
standard
necessarily
had
to
be
left
widely
discretionary.
but,
i
--
i
would
consider
that
the
president,
at
least,
considered
that
it
added
a
degree
of
instructive
interpretation
for
his
cabinet
heads,
and
i
submit
that
he
had
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
i
would
not
phrase
it
as
a
constitutional
question,
mr.
justice
black,
in
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
would
say
that
the
problem
presented
by
the
steel
seizure
case
in
its
constitutional
aspects
was
quite
different
from
that
involved
here.
you
were
there
dealing
with
the
president's
power
to
take
compulsive
action
with
respect
to
a
large
private
interest.
you
are
here
dealing
solely
with
the
president's
executive
function
of
dealing
with
the
administration
of
the
--
of
laws,
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
through
personnel
for
whom
he
is
necessarily
ultimately
responsible.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
we
--
we
don't
reach
that
issue
in
this
case
because
of
the
question
as
to
the
application
of
the
veterans'
preference
act.
we
do
not
cast
any
doubt
upon
the
validity
of
the
veterans'
preference
act.
now,
if
the
veterans'
preference
act
is
applicable
to
petitioner,
confessedly,
he
was
not
given
the
procedure
prescribed
by
that
act.
so,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
this
man
was
dismissed
under
a
test
which
is
inconsistent,
in
conflict,
with
the
statute,
public
law
733,
i
assume
it
was
then
conclude
that
the
petitioner
had
not
validly
been
taken
out
from
under
the
protection
of
the
veterans'
preference
act
and
that
his
dismissal
was,
for
that
reason,
improper.
now,
the
final
question
which
petitioner
raises
is
that
the
letter
of
dismissal
does
not,
as
he
terms
it,
state
the
reasons
for
the
dismissal.
and,
the
short
answer
to
that
is,
like
petitioner's
earlier
arguments,
he
is
reading
something
into
the
statute
that
just
is
not
there.
the
statute
does
not
impose
any
requirement
that
the
decision
shall
state
the
reasons
therefore.
the
only
reference
in
the
statute
that,
again,
if
the
court
wishes
to
refer
to
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
is
at
page
2
(a)
where
it
says
that
to
the
extent
that
the
interest
of
the
agency
head
determines
that
the
interest
of
the
national
security
permit,
the
employee
concerned
shall
be
notified
of
the
reasons
for
his
suspension
and,
within
30
days,
shall
have
opportunity
to
answer,
and
so
forth.
now,
that
contemplates
that
the
so-called
letter
of
charges
shall
state
the
reasons.
in
other
words,
“you
are
being
suspended
for
such
and
such
reasons
to
the
extent
that
security
considerations
permit
the
state
under
those
reasons.”
and,
it
is
significant
that
when
we
come
to
the
termination
language
in
this
act,
congress
did
not
say
anything
about
giving
the
employee
the
reasons
for
dismissal.
it
merely
said
give
him
a
written
statement
of
the
decision.
now,
that
distinction
between
reasons
and
decision
is
not
unique
in
this
act.
it
is
also
to
be
found
in
the
civil
service
law,
the
so-called
lloyd-lafollette
act
of
1912,
which
prescribes
procedure
for
the
dismissal
of
the
employees
in
the
classified
civil
service.
it
is
also
to
be
found
in
the
veterans'
preference
act.
each
of
those
laws
provides
that
the
employee
shall
be
given
a
statement
of
the
reasons
when
he
is
given
the
charges
so
that
he
may
prepare
his
defense
to
the
charges.
but,
neither
of
those
statutes
in
terms,
as
by
this
law,
provides
that
the
decision
--
the
ultimate
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
man
shall
be
fired
shall
contain
any
statement
of
the
reasons.
there
is
only
one
case
on
that
point
which
is
relied
on
by
petitioner.
that's
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
mulligan
case.
that
was
a
civil
service
dismissal
and
the
court
said
that
he,
there,
must
be
given
the
reasons
for
the
decision
because
the
civil
service
commission,
by
regulations
with
respect
to
that
type
of
dismissal,
has
explicitly
said
that
the
decision
shall
give
the
reasons.
so,
petitioner's
argument
is
that
where
the
law
or
the
regulations
specifically
says
the
decisions
will
contain
the
reasons,
that
that
is
--
that
result
also
follows
where
the
law
does
not
specifically
say
that
the
decision
shall
contain
the
reasons.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
the
reasons
were
the
so-called
letter
of
charges
in
the
record
of
page
16,
to
wit,
that
he
had
closely
associated
with
persons
reliably
reported
to
be
communists
and
the
other
charges.
those
were
the
reasons.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
and
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it
is
the
state
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well,
the
statute
merely
requires,
if
i
may
so
denominate
it,
a
type
of
pleading.
in
other
words,
the
statute
says
if
you
are
going
to
suspend
a
man,
you
shall
give
him
the
reasons
why
you
are
suspending
him
so
that
he
may
defend
himself
within
the
30-day
period
given
by
the
statute,
so
that
he
may
prepare
evidence
at
the
hearing
which
he
is
offered
by
the
agency.
but,
it
is
only
at
that
stage,
the
pleading
stage
of
the
case,
if
i
may
so
analogize
it,
that
the
question
of
the
reasons
comes
into
play,
not
at
the
ultimate
decision
stage.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
does
not
contemplate
any
so-called
finding
at
this
stage
of
the
process
merely
anymore
other
than
the
statutory
requirement
of
the
determination
of
the
agency
head
that
he
deems
it
necessary
or
advisable
in
the
interest
of
national
security
to
dismiss
the
man.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
we
think
not,
your
honor.
this
court
has
traditionally
taken
the
view
that,
where
we
are
dealing
with
procedures
for
the
dismissal
of
employees
in
the
executive
branch,
the
judicial
function
is
limited
to
determining
whether
the
procedural
steps,
the
procedural
benefits,
given
the
employee
by
statute
or
regulation
have
been
followed.
but,
this
court
has
several
times
stated
that
it
will
not
review
the
determination
that
the
agency
had
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
have
fired
this
man.
that
has
always
been
treated
as
an
executive
determination.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
if
your
honor
means
capricious
in
the
sense
of
a
decision
based
on
lack
of
evidence,
i
would
say,
yes.
in
another
words,
this
court
has
never
undertaken
to
review
or
even
to
look
into
the
degree
or
the
character
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
agency
had
made
its
determination.
it
always
limited
itself
to
saying
“was
the
man
given
a
proper
notice,
was
he
given
an
opportunity
to
answer,
was
he
given
a
hearing?”
where
the
law
gives
him
a
hearing.
if
those
procedural
requirements
have
been
given,
the
judicial
function
has
always
stopped
at
that
point.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that
would
depend
upon
whether
or
not
the
particular
statute
or
regulation
required
it,
and
our
whole
point
here
is
that
this
statute
does
not
require
findings,
if
by
findings
your
honor
means
what
petitioner
means
as
a
statement
of
the
reasons
for
the
action
taken.
it
is
up
--
it
is
truly
a
question
as
to
whether
congress
has
imposed
such
a
requirement
and,
here,
we
say,
plainly,
that
it
has
not.
now,
all
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that
has
always
been
so.
the
--
it
has
always
been
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it
has
always
been
considered
here
and
traditionally
that
the
executive
function
is
to
determine
whether
the
charges
are
well
founded
or
ill
founded
and
the
courts
have
never
interposed
their
judgment
on
the
executive
judgment
on
that
issue.
and,
we
think
that
that
traditional
approach
is
equally
applicable
under
this
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
your
honor,
i
think,
refers
to
page
63
of
our
brief.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
and
may
i
just
read
that
sentence?
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
it's
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
it
has
been
repeatedly
held
that
the
court's
will
not
inquire
into
the
merits
of
an
administrative
determination
of
what
constitutes
cause
for
discharge
at
least
in
the
absence
of
a
showing
of
arbitrary
or
capricious
action
plainly
unconnected
with
the
good
or
efficiency
of
the
federal
service.
now,
of
course,
that
has
reference.
the
efficiency
of
the
federal
service
has
reference
to
the
phrase
used
in
the
civil
service
statute
which
prohibits
dismissals
except
in
accordance
with
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
now
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
if
the
--
if
the
action
of
the
secretary
were
based
on
a
plainly
erroneous
interpretation
of
law,
a
pure
question
of
law,
i
would
say
that
there
might
be
a
question
that
the
courts
will
review
it.
that
--
to
my
knowledge,
that
case
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
because
all
--
all
--
this
court,
i
take
it,
will
review
the
question
of
whether
his
firing
was
capricious
in
the
real
sense
which
petitioner
raises,
as
i
see
it,
is
--
and
that
is,
in
a
sense,
“was
this
find
--
was
this
firing
authorized
as
a
matter
of
law?”
and
certainly,
this
court
will
review
that.
and
in
the
sense
that
the
secretary
made
the
conclusion
of
law
that
it
was
authorized,
of
course
this
court
will
review
it.
but
i
submit
that
this
court
will
not
and
this
--
and
our
language,
i
take
it,
is
not
to
be
taken
to
mean
it
that
if
they
are
an
issue
of
fact,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
evidence
adduced
proved
a
certain
charge
or
disapproved
it,
that
the
court
would
look
into
that.
now,
this
court
has
of
course,
in
the
mitchell
versus
public
workers
case,
expressed
the
statement
that
congress
could
not
constitutionally
say
that
all
--
that
no
baptists
shall
be
employed
in
the
government
or
that
no
german
but,
of
course,
we
have
here
nothing
of
that
kind.
they
hear
no
question
of
any
constitutional
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
religion
or
race
or
any
of
the
other
prohibited
discriminations.
we
have
here,
really,
as
i
see
it,
only
a
pure
question
of
law.
was
the
secretary
authorized
by
public
law
733
to
take
the
action
that
she
did?
that
issue,
this
court
will
review,
but
as
to
whether
the
secretary
had
information
or
evidence
justifying
these
charges,
i
submit
the
court
would
not
review
it
in
any
case
and
i
submit
it
will
not
do
it
here
where
the
petitioner,
by
failing
to
resort
to
his
remedy,
has
precluded
the
making
of
a
record
on
that
issue.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
well
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
am
not
aware,
your
honor,
of
any
--
you
refer
to
the
clearly
consistent
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
--
phraseology?
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
am
not
aware
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
am
not
aware
of
any
such,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
that's
right.
and
the
final
point
--
mr.
donald
b.
macguineas
i
shall
make
inquiry
and
notify
the
court
immediately.
our
final
point
on
the
question
as
to
propriety
of
the
letter
of
dismissal
is
that,
even
contrary
to
my
first
argument,
even
if
it
were
thought
that
the
secretary
did
have
to
state
her
reason,
that
the
letter
in
the
record
21
is
an
adequate
statement
of
the
reasons,
having
regard
to
the
fact
that
this
case
may
have
involved
the
dealing
in
security
confidential
information
which
the
secretary
felt
she
was
not
in
the
position
to
make
public.
i
don't
say
that
it
did
involve
that.
i
say
it
may.
we
have
no
basis
on
this
record
for
concluding
one
way
or
another.
but,
in
any
event,
our
--
our
basic
point
is
that
the
statute
requires
nothing
more
than
a
written
statement
of
the
decision,
and
that
was
given.
