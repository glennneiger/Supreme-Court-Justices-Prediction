justice
stanley
reed
what
do
you
mean
by
congressional
purpose,
is
it
in
the
act?
justice
stanley
reed
now,
i
didn't
quite
understand
why
you
say
that
we
couldn't
dismiss
it
by
destroying
the
discretion.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
he
had
--
he
had
that
under
the
statute.
justice
stanley
reed
in
his
discretion.
justice
stanley
reed
and
he
still
has
the
authority
to
apply
it
in
his
discretion.
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
i
don't
follow
you.
if
he
has
--
well,
go
ahead.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
statute
says
he
has
discretion
and
the
executive
order
says
you
can
apply
it
to
all
the
people
in
such
--
under
your
discretion
and
then
work
for
you
or
for
every
agency
of
the
government,
why
not?
maybe
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
maybe
it
shouldn't
be
applied.
justice
stanley
reed
but,
of
course,
the
statute
is
mandatorily
applied
in
the
sense
that
it
may
be
applied
all
through
the
government?
justice
stanley
reed
your
position
is
that,
because
that
was
unfair,
it
was
unconstitutional?
justice
stanley
reed
that's
your
argument?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
have
heard
you
said
statute
first.
justice
stanley
reed
the
agency
head.
justice
stanley
reed
something
in
the
nature
of
the
trial.
justice
stanley
reed
was
there
any
--
is
there
any
opportunity
for
a
hearing
in
these
cases?
justice
stanley
reed
and
an
order
is
handed
down?
justice
stanley
reed
that
a
statement
that
conclusion
is
handed.
justice
stanley
reed
you
raise
no
constitutional
question
about
his
right
to
refuse
to
answer
his
associations?
justice
stanley
reed
just
an
arbitrary
refusal
on
his
part
to
give
the
information.
justice
stanley
reed
if
the
government
does
have
a
right
to
inquire
about
the
associations
and
friendships
and
the
private
life
of
an
employee,
then
he
would
have
no
objection?
justice
stanley
reed
that
this
--
this
was
your
point
of
view
turns
on
whether
or
not
the
secretary,
or
whoever,
that
makes
the
examination
has
a
right
to
inquire
into
the
associations
of
employees.
justice
stanley
reed
if
he
associated
with
communists?
justice
stanley
reed
under
this
act,
if
he
associated
with
communists,
he
could
not
be
removed
as
a
security
measure.
justice
stanley
reed
non-sensitive
--
justice
stanley
reed
non-sensitive
position.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
under
that
section
4,
on
page
7(a),
they
refer
also
to
the
act
of
august
26,
1950.
justice
stanley
reed
and
they
say
it
shall
adjudicate
or
cause
to
be
re-adjudicated
in
accordance
to
the
act
of
august
26
under
a
security
standard
commensurate
to
that
established
under
this
order.
justice
stanley
reed
does
that
indicate
that
they
are
same?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that
--
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
section
4
is
the
sole
direction,
so
far
as
i
know,
for
a
reexamination.
and,
under
section
4,
they
direct
that
the
head
of
each
department
shall
review
in
order
--
what
was
the
old
act,
9835?
was
that
the
old
--
justice
stanley
reed
the
old
executive
order.
obviously,
9835
is
passed
in
the
act
of
august
26,
was
it,
march
20,
when
was
the
order?
justice
stanley
reed
april
26,
1950.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
been
passed
and
here
is
our
executive
order
putting
it
into
effect.
and,
now
you
can
review
under
that
act
in
the
new
order.
