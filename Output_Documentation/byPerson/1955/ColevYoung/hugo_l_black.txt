what's
their
purpose
if
that
is
not
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not
use
the
words,
in
effect,
to
establish
that
indication?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
why
interpret
it
if
they
mean
the
same?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
interpret
it
so
as
to
change
in
some
way
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
effect
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
to
improve
on
the
statutory
language
by
other
language
that
meant
precisely
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
that
make
it
easier
for
them
to
have
a
uniform
administration
in
the
agencies
if
the
language
means
precisely
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
this
is
clearer
than
the
language
that
congress
used?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
there
is
a
difference,
do
you
think
the
steel
seizure
case
would
raise
any
constitutional
question
which
had
to
be
met
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
invoke
the
doctrine
that
they
had
to
be
careful
so
as
not
to
invade
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
was
asking
you
that,
assuming
these
two
do
have
different
meanings
and
if
this
puts
on
a
bigger
burden
on
an
employee,
as
congress
had
done,
would
you
say
that
that
raised
the
constitutional
question
on
our
steel
seizure
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
that
would
give
the
president
power
to
fix
qualification
difference
to
those
which
congress
had
fixed
by
legislation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
reasons
did
she
give?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
macguineas,
whether
--
when
executive
order
number
10450
was
promulgated,
it
was
accompanied
by
the
interpretive
bulletin
for
the
public
either
prepared
by
the
president
or
the
attorney
general
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
showing
the
meaning
of
this
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
refer
to
the
bulletin
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
accompanied
this
at
the
time
it
was
promulgated
and
made
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know
of
any.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
--
if
you
find
one
which
was
released
at
the
same
time
or
right
about
the
same
time,
would
you
--
would
you
mind
following
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
reply
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
if
you
have
--
if
you
put
in
your
brief,
which
i
haven't
read,
any
statement
as
to
what
occurred
after
this
order
was
issued,
this
executive
order,
and
the
changes
made.
have
you
cited
to
us
what
action
was
taken
by
the
--
any
of
the
departments
in
connection
with
the
rescreening
of
employees
under
the
new
test?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
reason
for
their
closing
clause
on
section
4,
on
page
7(a)?
to
what
standard
is
--
what
standard
is
referred
to
there?
it
required
a
re-adjudication
on
the
security
standard
commensurate
with
the
established
--
that
established
under
this
order.
what
is
meant
by
that?
does
that
indicate
or
had
there
any
been
any
interpretation
to
show
whether
that
was
done
on
the
basis
that
the
order
did
make
a
change?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
was
the
reason
for
ordering
the
re-adjudication
if
the
standards
were
the
same?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
rule
or
regulation
to
which
you
can
refer
that
uses
language
different
for
this
in
connection
with
the
re-adjudication
or
restraining?
is
there
any
which
says
under
security
standard
commensurate
with
this
new
act,
this
says
with
the
new
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
this
is
on
the
security
standards
commission
with
that
established
under
this
order.
if
you
know
or
can
find
any
other
order,
any
other
rule
or
regulation
commonly
used,
which
said
they
are
to
be
reviewed
and
re-adjudicated
under
the
standard
established
by
the
act,
will
you
file
it
with
us?
