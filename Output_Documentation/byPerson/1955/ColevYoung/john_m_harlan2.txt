you
rest
your
positions
entirely
on
the

you
don't
--
justice

do
you
raise
a

question

(inaudible)

what
is

let's
say
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
are
talking
about
the
1950
act.
justice
john
m.

but
it
is
still
true
that
all
of
those
agencies,
on
their
face,
are
agencies
that
are
concerned
with
the
sensitive
area
of
national
security.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
doesn't

doesn't
the
fact
that
there
is
that
discretion
up
to
the
--
up
to
the
president
indicate
that,
in
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
act,
that
congress
had
in
mind
certain
distinctions
in
exercising
it?
if
he
want
--
if
they
wanted
to
put
all
agencies
of
the
government
under
the
impact
of
the
statute,
they
could
have
enacted
it
that
way.
