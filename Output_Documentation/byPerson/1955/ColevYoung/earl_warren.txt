mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
macguineas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macguineas,
you
said
that
he
waived
his
right
to
a
hearing
and
to
all
the
information
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he
might
get
at
such
a
hearing.
what
--
what
information
is
he
entitled
to,
under
your
interpretation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
like
in
the
peters
case
where
they
gave
him
none?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
do
you
consider
was
one
of
the
grounds
for
his
dismissal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
fact
that
he
did
not
avail
himself
of
a
hearing,
did
not
answer
those
messages?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
1950
act
applied
to
all
employees
of
the
named
departments
regardless
of
the
sensitivity
of
their
employment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
macguineas,
you
stated
a
moment
ago
that
you
believe
this
1950
act
applied
to
non-sensitive
as
well
as
sensitive
employment.
now,
if
that
is
true,
why
did
congress
provide
as
follows
in
this
act
and
as
it
appears
on
page
3
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief,
“provided
further
that
the
termination
of
employment
herein
provided
shall
not
affect
the
right
of
such
officer
or
employee
to
seek
or
accept
employment
in
any
another
department
or
agency
of
the
government”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
term
would
you
use
rather
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
claim
that,
for
instance,
a
leaf
raker
because
that
has
been
used
here,
do
you
claim
he
--
his
employment
has
an
effect
upon
the
national
security?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
say
so
in
this
act,
that
“anybody”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
who
measured
up
to
this
standard
of
danger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
then,
why
would
they
--
why
would
they
give
one
department
head
the
right
to
discharge
an
employee
because
he
was
a
danger
to
the
security
of
the
country
and
then,
in
the
same
statute,
give
him
the
right
to
seek
employment
in
another
department
and
give
another
department
the
right
to
employ
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can
understand
that,
but
let's
take
the
classic
employment
of
a
leaf
raker,
as
it's
been
used
in
these
proceedings.
now,
suppose
that
the
department
this
leaf
raker
was
working
in
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
endangered
the
security
of
the
country
and
discharged
him.
what
other
department
of
the
government
and
what
other
employment
can
you
conceive
of
his
being
taken
into
in
the
government
under
this
section
of
the
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
macguineas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
macguineas,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
as
to
the
extension?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
argue,
mr.
macguineas,
that
the
president
did
or
did
not
change
the
standard
for
separation
from
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
filing
of
charges
a
reason
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
--
or
is
it
necessary
to
have
those
substantiated
in
order
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
it
to
be
a
reason?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
it
be
one
thing,
so
far
as
reasons
are
concerned,
to
say
that
a
study
of
all
the
documents
in
the
case,
which
includes
the
complaint
against
this
man,
are
found
to
be
true.
and,
isn't
it
another
thing
to
say,
based
on
the
study
of
all
the
documents
in
your
case,
it
has
been
determined
that
your
continued
employment
in
the
department
is
so
and
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
shouldn't
there
be
some
finding
in
there
as
to
something
that
this
man
has
done
that
is
not
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
does
he
have
the
right
to
go
to
court
and
have
this
reviewed
as
to
whether
she
has
overstepped
the
bounds
of
discretion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
action
was
capricious?
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
that
also
include
findings
that
--
of
some
dereliction
or
some
omission
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
all
of
the
charges
could
be
admittedly
false
and,
if
the
head
of
the
agency
still
decided
to
discharge
the
employee,
there
would
be
no
review
of
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
want
to
know
if
that
is
your
position
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
--
i
thought
in
your
brief
you
conceded
that
if
--
if
the
action
of
the
secretary
was
capricious,
that
it
would
be
reviewable
in
the
court.
you
use
some
other
phrase
or
some
other
word
along
with
capricious.
now,
i
--
i
may
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
63.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
statement
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
yours
does
--
does
imply,
does
it
not,
that,
at
least
under
certain
circumstances,
the
petitioner
would
have
a
review
of
the
action
of
the
secretary
even
if
it
was
arbitrary
or
capricious.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
then
would
--
how
then
would
a
court
review
a
finding
of
this
kind
where
there
was
no
determination
as
to
the
facts
found
or
whether
they
came
within
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
