did
it
require
a
special
equipment
to
carry
these
--
these
bars?
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
makes
me
ask
a
question,
i
have
to
realize
that
in
--
in
the
scope
that
i
--
i
thought
it
was
a
special
equipment
that
you
spoke
of
here
to
change
the
cars
if
--
with
a
lot
of
them.
that's
one
aspect
of
it,
doesn't
it?

for
maytag.
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
that
all
of
her
contracts
must
be
a
part
of
interstate
commerce
commission.
justice
stanley
reed
each
--
each
contract
would
be
making
the
file.
justice
stanley
reed
you're
not
sure
whether
these
were
contracts
for
singles
shipments
or
whether
they
were
contracts
of
running
over
volumes.
justice
stanley
reed
we
--
we
don't
know
what
the
contracts
were.
justice
stanley
reed
i
--
perhaps,
i
don't
understand
what
specialization
is.
specialization,
does
that
mean
the
things
that
you
were
authorized
to
carry
by
your
contract
by
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
by
your
license?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
can
understand
specialization
in
trucks
that
carry
automobiles
or
--
or
tanks
that
carry
gasoline
of
that
(inaudible)
specialization.
do
you
think
there
is
something
besides
that?
justice
stanley
reed
what
the
specialization
they
gave
you
was
to
carry
--
not
--
not
only
the
short
and
long
steel
bars
but
also
carry
steel
equipment
of
different
kinds
as
i
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
as
i
understand
you.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
for
anything
except
those
long
bars,
would
you?
justice
stanley
reed
i
thought
they
were
so
long
they
had
to
be
--
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
did
that
mean?
justice
stanley
reed
if
--
if
the
order
goes
into
effect.
justice
stanley
reed
i
understood,
you'd
be
willing
to
--
not
to
advertise
to
--
