justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
whole
order?
is
that
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that's
the
order
then
--
then
why
does
this
have
to
turn
on
these
common
carriers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
read
again
about
the
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
specialization
test
relates
to
the
contract
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
order
--
that's
in
my
point,
the
order
indicate
that
the
commission,
as
--
as
you
say
it,
hasn't
opened
in
such
cases
as
to
the
common
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
why
are
we
doing
--
well,
how
can
we
not
sustain
the
order?
why
should
we
not
sustain
the
order
to
go
into
this
--
would
--
for
decision
on
what
does
or
doesn't
constitute
a
contract
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you're
--
you're
analogizing
what
seems
to
me
a
very
simple
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
that
is
not
--
that
--
that's
where
we
got
across
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now,
i
don't
understand
it.
but
why
is
nothing
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
second
paragraph
would
be
also
on
page
18.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
addressing
--
leaving
--
addressing
out
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
precise
order
which
has
been
invalidated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
this
judgment
if
you're
asking
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
question
before
this
court,
the
question
before
the
lower
court
was
the
validity
of
this
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
don't
agree
with
the
order.
what
i
read
is
that
the
machine
has
found
that
this
was
a
common
carrier
not
having
a
common
carrier
license.
and
you
should
get
it
out
of
there
that
--
is
that
right
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
barber.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
rather
ready
for
deciding
what
i
don't
have
to
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
as
a
goodness
of
the
case
that
i
say
that,
within
the
alibi
that
appellant
has
that
alibi.
as
i
understand
it,
the
commission
starts
out
with
the
proposition
that
the
distinction
between
contract
and
common
carriers
is
a
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can't
be
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
here
approved
this
is
a
common
carrier
not
having
a
common
carrier
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
that
the
only
question
before
me
whether
this
common
carrier,
if
i
--
if
i
--
if
as
i
agree
with
you,
assuming
i
agree
with
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commission
has
told
him
not
only
as
approvance
--
made
an
administrative
adjudication
that
he
is
a
common
carrier.
and
if
i
do
get
a
common
carrier
license,
that's
what
the
plaintiff,
i'd
like
to
ask.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
anything
about
that.
why
would
i
make
judicial
knowledge
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
order
at
all.
if
he
doesn't
want
to
become
a
common
carrier,
then
he
get
some
other
difficulties
or
opportunities
ahead
of
him.
the
commission
said,
“you're
a
common
carrier,
get
a
licence.”
now,
he
can
challenge
the
correctness
of
that,
the
foundation
of
that
order
and
say
he's
not
a
common
carrier.
but
he
can't
say
very
well,
“i'm
a
common
carrier,
but
i
want
to
become
a
contract
carrier
and
will
the
court
please
tell
me
what
is
necessary
to
bring
myself
in
conformity
with
an
order
which
the
commission
has
made.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
have
to
argue
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
case
is
that
you're
arguing
what's
to
be
valid
as
to
contract
carrier
is
and
i
say
that's
not
an
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
opinion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
more
phrase,
mr.
barber,
that
in
order
to
cease
operating
as
a
common
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
get
a
permit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
that
order
is
valid
if
he'd
be
a
common
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
criteria
for
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
of
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
--
and
all
of
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
put
it
to
you,
in
all
candid,
about
my
intelligence
in
(inaudible)
is,
i
can't
imagine
an
order
more
definite
than
this
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he's
--
well,
he's
one
of
the
common
carrier
and
he
has
to
get
a
license.
what's
indefinite
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
definitely
a
challenge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
that
is
in
my
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
let's
--
it
may
be
--
it
may
be
without
foundation.
it
may
not
be
a
common
carrier
and
in
your
problem
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
has
the
commission
--
has
the
commission
in
this
report
laid
down,
indicated
any
criteria
or
criterion
for
determining
what
is
a
common
carriers
except
the
old
one
going
back
of
(inaudible)
namely,
holding
out
generally,
has
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
determining
what
is
a
common
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
there
was
no
definition,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
definition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
definition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
difference
in
the
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
words
are
found
in
(inaudible)
of
the
cases
or
--
or
before
there's
a
--
a
common
fact
that
allow
the
motor
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying
to
me
is
that
i
must
change
my
view
and
it
has
to
change
my
view
of
what
is
a
common
carrier
under
the
motor
carriers
act,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
i
shouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
that
you
suggest,
of
course,
whether
a
particular
situation,
reach
the
common
law
test
on
that
situation
to
have
a
right
or
view
whether
the
fact
or
within
the
pattern.
that's
a
different
question.
you
spoke
with
an
assurance
which
i
had
to
break
to
you,
waive
as
make
it
but
this
is
an
open-and-shut
case.
it
is
a
common
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
a
common
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
carrier
is
and
i
don't
know
what's
inside
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
his
own
mind
if
he
operates
as
a
common
carrier.
indeed,
whoever
wants
his
facilities
can
have
them
(inaudible)
the
facilities
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
common
carrier
unless
if
the
statute
has
a
special
meaning.
the
statute
doesn't
have
a
special
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
say
is
view
of
complicated
circumstances
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
may
grind
the
position
one
way
or
the
other
in
finding
whether
it's
a
common
carrier.
and
i
say
that's
none
of
my
business,
provided
it
isn't
wholly
wanting
in
evidence
that
consider.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
why
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
is
open-and-shut.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
if
i
read
this
record,
as
i
have
not
done,
if
i
read
it
conscientiously,
i
would
have
to
find
that
this
carrier
is
not
a
common
law
common
carrier,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
makes
the
law
vis-à-vis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
burchmore,
you
suggested
a
minute
ago
that
(inaudible)
there's
no
doubt
about
it
you
went
wholly
out
of
that
(inaudible)
of
your
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
all
the
common
carrier
does,
involving
a
none
--
such
as
the
world
and
you
tell
me
what
it
is
to
and
i'll
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
a
common
--
a
common
carrier
doesn't
say,
“i'm
a
common
carrier.”
that's
a
conclusion
of
law.
that's
not
an
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
the
report
of
the
commission
as
i've
just
read
it,
here
is
an
announcement
that
involved
courts
in
iowa,
it
wasn't
contested
that
that
was
the
(inaudible)
i
don't
know
how
all
carriers
been
more
flagrant,
meaning
by
flagrant,
more
--
more
candidly
and
more
flagrantly
to
say,
“anybody
who
wants
my
services
should
come
to
me
and
--
and
i'll
give
it.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
all
the
common
carrier
and
that
--
that's
makes
a
man
a
common
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody
in
iowa
could
come,
serving
all
points
in
iowa.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
depends
whether
this
ad
doesn't
make
things,
isn't
a
holding
of
it.
that
turns
on
the
--
the
legal
(inaudible)
of
what
this
transaction
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statement
of
the
interveners
account
was
not
evidences
and
has
had
no
effect
upon
all
evaluation
of
the
evidence
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
i
am
referring
to
that
statement
because
if
the
appellant
looks
at
an
ad
in
the
paper
because
i've
heard
all
points
in
iowa
for
myself
and
just
for
myself.
i
cannot
imagine
a
clear
or
holding
of
the
common
carriers
in
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
let
me
read
you
on
page
15
of
the
commission,
although
the
fact
here
are
meager
in
some
respects
to
reveal
a
pattern
with
extraordinary
expansion
in
the
period
of
approximately
eight
months
and
its
easy
to
turn
over
of
context
thereafter.
he
believed
that
there
is
ample
evidence
to
show
that
this
expansion
was
brought
about
to
some
extent,
i
believe,
by
indiscriminate
solicitation
and
advertising
among
other
things,
meaning
subsequent
to
the
cancellation
of
13
contracts,
some
of
which
had
been
referred
by
others.
the
number
of
contracts
is
being
enormous
in
the
circumstances
here
present.
ultimate
test
to
be
applied
in
--
in
the
nature
of
the
holding-out
to
the
public
on
the
part
of
the
carrier
and
with
the
freight
case
to
which
this
is
on.
this
is
all
language
that
seems
to
me
all
echoes
of
all
common
laws
just
as
our
common
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
holding
sympathetically
a
general
proposition
and
you
notice
to
imply
it,
i
wouldn't
have
to
find
on
reading
the
commission's
report
and
i
think
you
would
agree.
i
would
have
to
sign.
i'm
reading
the
commission's
report
that
they
said,
the
criterion
or
what
constitutes
a
common
carrier
is
big
length
of
business
in
these
areas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
wouldn't
i
have
to
find
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
say
now,
you
--
both
the
one
--
both
sides
are
equally
clear
in
opposite
directions,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
what
have
you
most
derived?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
have
contracts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
my
mind,
that
means
that
--
that
they
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
case
that
we
are
now
deciding
the
case
upon
the
specialization
test,
the
number
of
contracts
and
the
lack
of
specialization.
and
i
may
say
further
that
if
that
is
the
case,
the
court
below,
judge
lindley
and
district
judges
parkinson
and
sweigert,
earnestly
attempted
to
find
out
what
the
commission
had
said
here.
and
if
those
three
judges
were
unable
to
find
out
from
the
commission's
report,
then
the
commission's
findings
are
inadequate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
order
must
be
--
its
order
must
be
judged
as
to
the
time
the
commission
rendered
it.
