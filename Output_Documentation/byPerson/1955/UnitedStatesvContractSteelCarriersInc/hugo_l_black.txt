is
--
is
it
your
idea
that
if
one
violates
the
law
that
way,
clearly,
that
the
license
that
you
take
on
to
waive
on
this
because
of
the
previous
violations,
is
that
involved
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
you
say
is
on
--
on
the
record,
it's
an
open-and-shut
case
or
just
the
other
way
from
what's
the
requirement
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
did
the
commission
criticize
your
specialization?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
you
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i
meant
to
answer
the
question
by
saying
that
even
if
there
were
evidence
here
that
--
that
they
had
been
at
one
time
in
operation
as
a
common
carrier,
you
would
have
to
affirm
the
court
below
because
the
commission
did
not
decide
the
case
upon
that
basis.
the
commission
explicitly
waived
the
evidence
in
favor
of
deciding
the
case
on
the
basis
of
its
theory
of
contract
carrier.
it
said,
“you're
a
common
carrier
because
you're
not
sufficiently
specialized
or
don't
have
few
enough
contracts
to
be
a
contractor.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
they
did
when
they
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
they
did
when
they
say
that
we
accept
these
matters
for
such
effect
as
they
have
upon
status.
now,
that
raises
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
what
penalty
do
you
concede
you
would
subjected
if
the
order
was
sustained
and
it
was
held
that
you've
kept
15
contracts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
held
that
you
would
violate
the
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is,
if
the
order
should
be
sustained
and
goes
in
effect,
it
would
--
that
would
be
the
penalties
to
which
you
could
be
subjected.
