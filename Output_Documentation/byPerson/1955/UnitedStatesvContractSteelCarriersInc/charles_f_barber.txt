mr.
charles
f.
barber
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana.
the
case
arises
under
the
motor
carrier
act.
it
confirms
the
distinction
between
common
carriers
and
contract
carriers.
those
terms
are
used
in
the
act.
this
is
the
distinction
this
court
has
noted
that
congress
has
preserved
throughout
the
act
and
upon
which
the
economic
regulation
of
the
motor
carrier
industry
is
based.
the
nub
of
the
distinction
is
this.
a
common
carrier
is
one
which
undertakes
to
serve
or
hold
itself
out
to
serve
the
public
generally.
a
contract
carrier,
on
the
other
hand,
are
carriers
for
hire
that
operate
under
individual
contracts
and
agreements
and
are
not
common
carriers.
the
two
types
of
carriers
are
mutually
exclusive
and
embrace
all
carriers,
all
motor
carriers
for
hire.
appellee
in
this
case
held
a
contract
carrier
permit.
it
was
found
by
the
commission
to
have
conducted
operations
as
a
common
carrier
unauthorized
by
its
permit.
we
have
two
issues
in
this
case.
first,
whether
the
commission's
finding
is
supported
by
the
evidence,
and
second,
whether
the
remedial
order
entered
by
the
commission
is
void
for
vagueness.
the
so-called
specialization
test
discussed
in
the
brief
is
in
our
view
a
part
of
the
second
question.
it
goes
to
the
specificity
of
the
order.
the
facts
are
these.
appellee
was
issued
a
contract
carrier
permit
in
1940
on
proof
that
he
operated
a
highly
specialized
carrier
service
for
three
shippers.
the
service
that
he
offered
was
this.
he
had
10
trucks
and
trailers.
they
were
equipped
to
carry
extra
length
steel
reinforcing
bars.
the
motor
carrier
report
filed
by
the
commission
in
the
permit
case
says
that
the
bars
were
up
to
90-feet
in
length.
such
bars
were
used
in
highway,
culvert
and
bridge
construction.
they
require
delivery
in
many
cases
far
off
established
highways.
the
drivers
were
trained
to
follow
the
engineer's
survey
marks
and
to
deliver
their
loads
of
steel
often
in
the
absence
of
any
of
the
consignees'
representatives
by
locating
the
engineering
mark
in
the
field
and
leaving
the
steel
bars
there.
by
the
spring
of
1951,
the
proof
showed,
appellee
had
listed
with
the
commission
13
contracts.
eleven
of
these
were
with
kansas
city
shippers.
only
one
was
with
an
illinois
steel
company,
none
was
with
an
iowa
shipper.
as
you
look
at
the
names
of
the
companies,
you
see
they
are
steel
companies
and
construction
companies
by
and
large.
at
this
point,
in
1951,
appellee
underwent
a
burst
of
expansion.
less
than
a
year
later,
in
march
1952,
it
had
69
contracts
including
eight
with
illinois
steel
company
and
47
with
iowa
shippers.
as
you
rundown
the
list
of
companies
with
which
he
had
contracts,
they
include
a
range
of
light
engineering
companies.
maytag
is
one,
furnace
company,
a
good
many
familiar
names
among
them.
it's
no
wonder
that
a
group
of
small
common
carriers
engaged
in
the
business
of
hauling
livestock
from
chicago
or
from
iowa
farms
to
the
chicago
area
and
depending
for
their
return
load
on
steel
products,
which
they
had
been
certificated
to
carry
by
the
commission,
became
alarmed
and
brought
this
complaint.
what
did
the
proof
show?
how
did
appellee
accomplish
this
extraordinary
expansion
in
a
short
period?
mr.
charles
f.
barber
as
--
to
carry
the
90-foot
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
that
--
that
goes
to
an
important
aspect
of
the
proof
in
this
case.
when
the
original
permit
was
issued,
appellee
showed
that
he
had
10
trucks.
each
of
which
could
carry
these
oversized
steel
bars
up
to
90-feet
in
length.
the
substance
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
is
that
he
had
departed
from
that
sort
of
business
and
was
now
engaged
in
quite
a
different
type
of
business.
all
be
it
within
the
scope
of
his
permit.
i
might
explain
that.
his
permit
was
founded
on
the
special
requirements
of
these
oversized
bars
used
in
bridges,
culverts
and
highways.
in
--
when
he
was
making
a
delivery,
he,
of
course,
carried
other
steel
products
use
in
highway
constructions,
tapes
and
clamps.
there
are
number
of
things
that
he
listed
in
his
proof.
his
permit
covered
--
steel
products
and
steel
articles
and
other
products
used
and
useful
in
highway
construction
except
sand
gravel
and
several
other
things.
now
then,
later
on
at
the
period
of
his
complaint,
he
was
using
the
other
things
to
transport
the
--
the
part
of
his
permits
which
applied
to
other
than
steel
bars.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
to
--
for
maytag,
for
the
furnace
company
and
so
on.
well,
the
question
comes
down
to
a
good
deal
to
holding-out.
this
advertisement
at
page
90
of
the
record
was
inserted
in
the
chicago
motor
traffic
directory.
this
is
a
telephone
book
for
shippers
in
the
chicago
area,
steel
transportation
company,
that
was
appellee's
name
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
iowa
division,
serving
all
points
in
iowa,
daily
dependable
service,
flat
beds,
condulets,
vents,
all
standard
equipment
in
further
elaboration
on
your
question,
mr.
justice
reed.
at
the
other
end
of
the
market,
the
proof
shows
that
he
appointed
a
divisional
manager
whose
office
was
at
des
moines
and
who
actively
solicited
accounts
in
iowa.
he
was
extraordinarily
successful.
the
proof
show
that
this
man
working
in
iowa
was
able
to
sign
up
every
steel
receiver
of
consequence
in
the
des
moines
area,
a
total
of
16
contracts.
moreover,
appellee
behaved
in
other
ways
like
a
common
carrier.
there's
a
true
bill
in
evidence,
on
page
93
of
the
record,
showing
an
interchange
of
shipment
with
a
common
carrier.
there
is
a
lease
in
evidence
of
a
truck
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
shows
that
this
truck
is
a
livestock
truck
which
transported
bulls
to
chicago
moving
in
the
other
direction.
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
oh,
i
--
i
assume
it
would,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
you
have
16,
you
say,
sir?
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
16
contracts,
i
should
think,
is
--
is
closer
to
the
line.
this
man
had
69,
69
contracts
with
a
variety
of
shippers
in
the
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
is
where
you
have
it
to
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir,
that
is
all
he
was
certificated
to
carry
or
--
it
is
(inaudible)
company.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
cattle
are
exempt
from
the
requirements
of
the
motor
carrier
act
and
so
anyone
can
haul
cattle.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
made
that
comment
not
say
it
hold
it
against
him
as
you
say,
but
to
point
out
that
the
trucks
which
were
leased
to
him
were
not
specialized
equipment
in
anyway.
they
were
standard
livestock
trucks
like
common
carriers,
motor
carriers
generally
use
in
their
business.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
it's
the
--
it's
a
central
issue
that
the
commission
is
interested
in.
we
are
very
concerned
that
the
court
below
dealt
with
the
specialization
test
as
it
did.
in
this
case,
we
think
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
carrier
had
held
itself
out
to
serve
the
public.
we
have
about
as
clear
a
case
as
you
could
imagine,
a
full
page
advertisement
in
the
chicago
directory,
widespread
solicitation
of
iowa
steel
receivers
and
a
burst
of
expansion
of
business
in
a
very
short
period,
showing
in
easy
interchange
of
contracts
as
well
as
a
--
a
holding-out
to
accept
any
business
he
could
get.
so,
on
the
holding-out
issue,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
finding
that
he
operated
as
common
carriers
supported
by
the
evidence,
i
think,
we
have
a
--
with
all
due
respect
to
the
court
below,
an
open-and-shut
case
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
order
is
sufficiently
definite
to
stand
the
test
which
have
been
applied
by
this
court
to
such
cases.
we
must
look
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
criteria
to
which
the
order
refers
and
those
criteria
are
the
specialization
tests
as
it
has
been
elaborated
by
the
commission.
so,
i
think,
the
specialization
test
comes
up
in
the
second
branch
of
the
case
rather
than
the
first.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it's
at
page
2
of
the
record.
i'll
read
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
is
not
involved
in
this
--
here.
a
motion
was
made
for
--
that
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
this
case
institute
what
is
called
a
revocation
proceeding,
to
determine
--
issue
an
order
requiring
this
carrier
to
show
cause
why
his
permit
should
not
be
revoked
under
the
provisions
of
the
motor
carrier
act.
the
commission,
the
examiner
said
that
that
motion
was
not
within
the
scope
of
the
hearing
and
it
was
not
renewed
before
the
commission.
so,
to
answer
your
question,
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
it
is
a
possible
remedy
which
the
commission
has
in
the
case
of
aggravated
violations
of
the
law.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
is
--
was
--
yes,
sir.
it
was
right
in
finding
that
there
has
been
a
violation.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
very
much
so,
yes,
sir.
the
order
required
appellee
to
cease
and
desist
from
the
operations
as
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
which
it
is
found
in
said
report
now
to
be
conducting
without
appropriate
authority
by
the
commission.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
is
the
order
with
(inaudible)
introductory
paragraph
and
so
on,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
have
your
question,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
order
which
is
appended
to
a
report
which
reviews
the
facts.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
says
the
order
is
at
page
18
of
the
record
which
reviews
the
facts,
reviews
the
operations
which
appellee
was
found
to
be
conducting.
it
sets
forth
the
need
for
it
to
reform
its
operations
to
bring
itself
into
compliance
with
the
law.
sets
forth
the
criteria
which
the
commission
has
used
in
such
cases.
those
criteria
are
summed
up
in
specialization
test.
then,
the
order
says,
is
require
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
you
--
you
have
a
very
valid
question
that
we
maybe
anticipating
the
issue
which
will
come
up
when
this
carrier
comes
into
the
commission,
it
says,
“this
is
what
i
have
done
to
comply
with
the
order
and
which
a
hearing,
if
he
request
it,
will
be
held
and
a
determination
of
the
commission
is
entered.”
so,
our
discussion
of
these
criteria
may
in
a
sense
be
premature
but
they
go
to
the
form
of
the
order.
it's
like
the
usual
case
in
antitrust
decree.
you
had
it
in
the
united
shoe
decree
which
was
before
you
shortly
ago.
in
that
case,
judge
wyzanski
directed
united
shoe
to
come
in
with
a
plan
to
accomplish
the
termination
of
certain
leases.
now,
if
that
had
been
contested,
you
could
have
say,
“well,
why
should
we
discuss
now
what
is
the
appropriate
thing
for
united
shoe
to
do.”
if
united
shoe
is
not
satisfied
with
the
action
that
the
district
court
takes
on
the
plan
which
it
submits,
of
course,
it
can
bring
out
that
later
adjudication
for
review
by
the
court.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
or
rather
complicated.
the
commission
had
given
through
this,
this
carrier,
the
common
carrier
operating
without
a
license.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
as
do
yourself
in
conformity,
you
come
in
and
get
license
to
the
common
carriers.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
this
--
this
proceeding
is
a
complaint
proceeding.
this
carrier
has
not
come
in
for
a
common
carrier
or
if
it
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
when
they
order
to
cease
and
desist
from
operating
as
a
common
carrier
and
i
see
what
you're
looking
to
until
such
authority
has
been
obtained.
well,
now,
i
assume
that
appellee's
assumption
would
be
that
if
he
came
in
for
common
carrier
permit
or
certificate,
he
could
not
get
one.
why?
because
a
number
of
common
carriers
have
been
certificated
to
carry
this
traffic
from
chicago
to
iowa.
he
would
have
to
show
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
as
we
all
know
in
an
industry
which
is
well-developed,
it
is
not
easy
for
a
carrier
to
show
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
traffic
that
is
well-taken
care
of
by
existing
common
carriers.
so,
his
problem
under
this
order,
if
he
decides
not
to
come
in
for
a
common
carrier,
a
certificate
which,
of
course,
is
an
alternative
open
to
him,
his
problem
will
be
to
reform
his
operations
so
that
they
meet
the
test
of
a
contract
carrier.
if,
for
example,
he
--
his
modus
operandi
becomes
as
it
was
when
he
got
his
contract
carrier
permit,
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
commission
would
enter
an
order
finding
him
in
compliance
with
the
act.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
is
a
question
of
degree.
if
a
carrier
serves
a
very
few
shippers,
so
that
he
operates
virtually
as
a
part
of
the
shipper's
organization,
an
example
is
the
contract
carrier
who
carries
for
a.n.p.
then,
the
commission
finds
him
entitled
to
contract
carrier
status.
it's
a
special
individualized
service.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
carrier
has
highly
specialized
equipment,
the
commission
finds
that
it
meets
this
requirement
of
the
act
for
individual
contracts
and
agreements.
appellee
qualified
under
both
of
those
tests.
now,
as
you
increase
the
number
of
carriers
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
contract
carrier,
the
commission
requires
a
higher
degree
of
specialization
in
service.
one
of
the
largest
contract
carriers
in
terms
of
number
of
customers
is
a
carrier
which
has
a
service
in
metropolitan
areas
of
moving
checks
from
banks
to
the
clearing
house
and
clearing
house
to
the
banks.
they
have
bonded
employees.
they
have
keys
into
their
customers'
establishments.
you've
seen
the
vaults
that
sit-out
in
access
to
the
street.
and
the
commission
has
permitted
them
to
operate
as
contract
carriers
despite
the
fact
that
they
have
many
customers.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
that
this
is
an
--
this
is
an
open-and-shut
case
of
common
carrier.
why
do
i
have
to
bother
about
the
suggestion
of
contract
carriers?
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
appellee
will
say,
“the
commission
has
issued
an
order.
if
i
don't
comply
with
that
order,
i
can
be
taken
to
court
and
assess
penalties
of
$100
for
each
day
that
i
am
not
in
compliance.”
he
says,
“i
don't
know
how
to
comply
with
that
order.
the
commission
didn't
tell
me
to
cancel
10
contracts
or
12
contracts
or
15
contracts.”
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i
think
appellee
will
bear
me
out
in
saying
that
if
you
approach
the
case
that
way,
you're
--
[laughs]
you're
paying
short
trip
to
his
very
earnest
urgings
that
he
can't
get
a
common
carrier
permit
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
or
maybe
he
can't
get
a
common
carrier
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
but
he
says,
“what
i
have
to
do
under
this
order
is
to
get
within
my
contract
permit.”
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
my
order
for
today.
if
i
get
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i'll
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
[laughs]
i
don't
want
to
be
arguing
his
case.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
think
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
we
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
sir,
let
me
state
what
we
are
arguing.
we
are
arguing
that
this
order
which
requires
appellee
to
cease
operations
which
it
has
found
in
the
report
of
the
commission
to
be
unauthorized
by
its
permit,
his
order
to
cease
those
operations.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
no.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
or
get
a
permit
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
or
get
a
certificate
so
that
he
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
welcome
any
suggestion
that
will
lead
this
court
to
reverse
the
decision
below.
i
would
only
add
a
footnote
to
it
and
that
is
that
the
criteria
of
the
commission
which
are
set
forth
in
its
report
are
reasonable
and
sensible
criteria.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
criteria
for
distinguishing
between
contract
and
common
carriers.
i
think
your
honors
have
said
in
regulatory
cases
that
the
order
entered
by
the
agency
must
be
sufficiently
definite
to
apprise
the
appellee
of
what's
required.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
we
think
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
it
has
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
sir,
that's
a
--
a
statement
which
i
can
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
if
your
honor
--
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
if
--
if
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
would
hope
in
approaching
the
case
and
that
way
if
you
do
that
you
not
toward
the
reasonableness
of
the
criteria
of
the
commission
set
forth
in
the
report.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
yes,
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
we
--
we
have
two
mutually
exclusive
definitions.
the
common
carrier
definition
as
it
appeared
in
the
law
originally,
spoke
of
carriers
who
undertake
motor
transportation
by
motor
carrier.
and
contract
carriers
were
carriers
who
undertake
carriage
for
hire
under
individual
contracts.
now,
the
administrative
problem
was
fitting
the
pattern
of
operations
of
motor
carriers
for
hire
into
those
two
categories.
the
commission
obtained
a
great
deal
of
light
from
the
common
law
cases
which
imposed
obligations
of
common
carriage
on
carriers
which
hold
themselves
out.
i
--
those
were
the
word
--
words
of
art
at
common
law.
those
were
not
the
words
in
the
original
definition
of
common
carriers.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
there
was
a
definition.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
definition
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
the
definition
in
the
statute
as
it
was
originally
enacted,
the
amended
version
is
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
read,
“the
term
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
means
any
person
who
or
which
undertakes
whether
directly
or
by
a
lease
or
by
any
other
arrangement
to
transport
by
motor
vehicle
and
interstate
of
foreign
commerce
and
so
on.”
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
any
different
or
not.
but
i
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
i
--
i
contest
with
you
on
this
for
this
reason.
the
court
below
said,
“the
common
law
task
of
common
carriage
was
perfectly
clear
and
definite.
therefore,
the
commission
could
not
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute
in
order
to
develop
a
practicable
test
in
which
to
handle
the
borderline
cases.”
and
there
are
very
few
borderline
cases.
a
recent
estimate
by
the
contract
carrier
conference
is
that
there
are
fewer
than
20
contract
carriers
with
more
than
15
customers.
that's
only
in
those
very
few
cases
where
the
commission
is
led
to
find
the
holding-out
by
the
pattern
of
operations.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
now
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
no,
sir.
you
don't
have
to
change
your
view.
i
only
ask
that
you
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
--
that
you
do
not
use
it
as
a
reason
for
preventing
the
commission
from
doing
the
reasonable,
sensible
thing
with
its
eye
on
its
regulatory
purpose
to
these
few
contract
carriers
which
you
might
think
--
or
these
few
carriers
which
may
or
may
not
meet
a
strict
common
law
test.
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
do.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that
he
had
operated
as
a
common
carrier.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes,
he
held
himself
up.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
well,
let
me
reply
by
saying,
in
this
case,
i
don't
have
any
difficulty
either
under
the
common
law
test.
i
am
led
to
caution
only
because
a
distinguished
circuit
judge
and
two
district
judges
thought
that
when
he
looked
to
the
common
law
test,
he
was
required
before
we
can
reach
a
different
conclusion
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
why
i'm
led
--
mr.
charles
f.
barber
that's
why
i
led
to
caution.
