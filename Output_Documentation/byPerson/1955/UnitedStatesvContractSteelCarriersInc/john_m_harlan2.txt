i'm
not
quite
clear
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
of
what
you
said
last.
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
irrespective
whether
the
specialization
was
a
proper
test
or
not.
we
are
holding-out
here
is
whether
the
commission
is
right
irrespective
of
whether
i
can
give
the
wrong
reason
if
i
didn't
understand
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
did
you
say
that
when
it
comes
to
the
enforceability
of
the
order,
the
vagrancy,
the
order
of
specialization
test
is
the
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing,
mr.
burchmore,
that
we
should
come
to
a
conclusion
that
there
was
enough
evidence
here.
suppose
that
the
commission
order
could
be
upheld
on
the
theory
of
degree
to
be
the
proper
cases,
so
you
know.
what
should
we
do
with
the
case?
