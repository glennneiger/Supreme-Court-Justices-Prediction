mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
has
observed
that
the
order
in
this
case
ordered
the
appellee
to
cease
operating
as
a
common
carrier.
if
there
had
been
evidence
that
the
appellee
was
operating
as
a
common
carrier,
the
order
could
not
be
successfully
obtained,
but
the
commission
acted
without
evidence.
the
commission
substituted
for
evidence
a
theory
as
to
what
constitutes
a
contract
carrier
and
it
held
in
its
report
that
if
you
are
not
a
contract
carrier
according
to
the
commission's
theory
of
contract
carriage,
you,
therefore,
automatically
become
a
common
carrier
ergo
the
order
issues.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
that
is
my
position
and
it
has
not
operated
at
any
time
as
a
common
law
common
carrier
or
as
a
common
carrier
as
defined
by
congress
in
the
statute.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
i
do,
most
assuredly.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
four
years
ago,
i
left
my
office
to
attend
a
hearing
in
this
proceeding
which
was
held
by
the
commission
in
chicago
upon
the
complaint
of
some
competitors
of
the
client,
the
appellee,
from
whom
he
had
attracted
some
of
their
trucking
business.
rather
than
compete
in
the
marketplace
of
carriage,
his
competitors
chose
to
attack
the
appellee
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
alleged
that
he
was
violating
the
law.
the
commission
set
the
case
for
hearing
and
the
hearing
lasted
long
enough
to
make
a
60-page
record.
it
started
with
the
examiner's
usual
announcement
of
what
the
commission
had
set
for
hearing
and
this
is,
you
will
see
from
the
record,
was
followed
by
the
complainant
searching
the
hearing
room
for
some
officer
or
a
person
from
the
defendant
appellee
and
he
could
question
as
to
his
operations.
there
being
none
in
the
room,
they
proceeded
to
testify,
practitioner
himself
offering
the
testimony
that
a
large
number
of
contracts
had
appeared
in
the
commission's
files
as
having
been
entered
into
by
this
defendant
appellee
here.
there
was
not
a
word
of
evidence
as
to
what
the
contracts
contain.
they
were
not
offered
in
evidence,
although
they
were
on
file
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
never
took
the
trouble
to
examine
them.
all
that
was
really
laid
before
the
commission
in
that
hearing
was
the
quantity
of
business
that
was
being
done.
we
were
doing
too
much
business.
i'll
come
back
to
that
because
the
statutory
definitions
of
carriers
is
not
--
does
not
hinge
upon
quantitative
elements.
it
hinges
upon
qualitative
elements
not
how
much
business
a
carrier
does
but
what
kind
of
business
it
does
and
in
what
manner
it
does
it.
beyond
the
matter
of
how
many
contracts
had
been
entered
into,
there
were
these
other
elements
which
i,
with
all
respect
to
the
commission,
termed
trivia,
namely,
a
bill
of
lading
which
showed
that
one
shipment
that
had
been
carried
under
a
contract
properly
on
file
with
the
commission
in
accordance
with
its
regulations
had
been
“interchanged”
with
another
carrier.
in
other
words,
the
appellee
had
not
carried
the
shipment
from
its
first
origin
to
final
destination
but
had
picked
up
the
shipment
from
another
carrier
to
take
it
to
destination
for
its
contracting
party.
now,
i
should
not
labor
a
trivial
matter
but
just
by
way
of
illustration,
let
me
describe
to
the
court
that
in
transportation
parlance,
and
as
the
commission
well
knows,
interchange
is
a
term
of
art
having
to
do
with
a
movement
of
goods
where
one
carrier
transports
them
partway
and
turns
them
over
to
another
to
be
transported
the
rest
of
the
way.
and
there
are
myriad
of
arrangements
of
combination
or
joint-through
rates
which
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
here.
ordinarily
speaking,
the
commission
has
said,
“contract
carriers
do
not
interchange
shipments
with
common
carriers.”
that
is
true
and
we
have
not
interchanged
shipments.
but
it
being
necessities
of
commerce
that
people
who
employ
contract
carriers
be
able
to
have
the
facility
of
moving
their
goods
by
their
contract
carrier
and
fence
beyond
when
the
goods
need
to
move
beyond.
the
commission,
in
a
formal
proceeding,
held
that
it
is
entirely
proper
for
a
contract
carrier
to
carry
for
one
of
its
contracting
parties
a
shipment
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
line
of
that
contract
carrier,
to
act
as
the
agent
of
his
contracting
party
for
the
purpose
of
placing
the
goods
in
the
hands
of
some
other
carrier,
common
or
contract,
to
move
beyond.
so
the
physical
movement
of
the
goods
is
permitted
and
it
is
done
in
that
way.
there
was
no
evidence
at
this
hearing
as
to
how
the
so-called
interchange
was
performed
in
this
case.
but
the
reason
i
call
it
trivia
is
because
no
matter
how
it
was
performed,
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
forum
and
not
of
substance.
if
we
made
the
mistake
of
using
the
wrong
papers,
that
was
all
the
mistake
we
made.
we
could
have
accomplished
the
same
result
by
using
different
forms
of
papers.
now,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
the
ad
in
the
paper
was
another
item.
that
was
a
--
a
listing
in
the
chicago
motor
traffic
directory
which
blazoned
across
the
page
that
we
were
a
carrier
and
we
hauled
steel
between
chicago
and
iowa
and
we
offered
daily
service.
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
whether
that
paper
in
which
that
circular
was
printed
was
circulated
to
the
public
generally.
all
the
record
show
is
this,
that
it
was
put
in
the
hands
of
chicago
shippers.
we
may
as
well
not
have
any
question
about
it
from
the
beginning
of
this
case.
this
carrier
did
go
out
after
business.
he
went
out
and
negotiated
new
contracts.
he
wanted
to
increase
his
business
and
he
did
increase
his
business.
we
think
that
a
contract
carrier
has
the
right
to
do
that
and
this
section
903
of
the
act
specifically
says
that
nothing
shall
prevent
the
right
of
a
carrier
to
add
to
his
or
its
contracts
or
substitute
contracts
as
the
--
as
the
demands
of
the
public
and
the
requirements
in
his
business
dictate.
but
in
any
event,
that
ad
or
listing
did
not
hold
out
an
indiscriminate
service
to
the
public
generally
to
take
the
business
of
all
commerce.
it's
simply
dated
boldly
that
we
are
in
business
and
we
do
hold
traffic.
now,
if
pursuant
to
that
ad
and
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
happened,
if
it
had
happened
that
a
shipper
saw
that
and
approached
the
carrier,
the
carrier
still
would
be
wholly
within
his
rights
and
acting
properly
if
he
negotiated
with
the
shipper,
the
terms
on
the
possibilities
and
the
methods
of
entering
into
a
contract
and
performing
as
a
contract
carrier
or
not
performing
it.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
that
is
correct.
that's
required
by
regulation.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
each
contract
that
was
made
was
filed.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
the
record
doesn't
show
anything
about
the
contracts
except
that
they
were
on
file
with
the
commission.
the
commission
didn't
bother
to
look
at
them
although
we
invited
them
to.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
no,
the
record
does
not
show.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
we
did
not
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
i
should
not
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
well,
i
didn't
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
that
would
make
a
man
a
common
carrier
but
this
man
did
not
do
that.
he
did
not
say
to
the
whole
world,
“all
who
want
my
services,
come
and
i
will
give
it.”
he's
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
that
is
correct
but
not
serving
all
people
in
iowa
or
not
holding
himself
out
to
serve
all
people
in
iowa.
if
they
came
to
him,
he
might
and
he
might
not
take
them
on.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
the
ad
--
the
ad
certainly
is
ambiguous
in
that
--
in
that
sense
and
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
at
the
cause
of
the
hearing,
counsel
for
the
appellee,
who
had
not
known
of
this
ad,
announced
the
examiner
that
on
the
advise
of
counsel,
the
carrier
would
hereafter
make
his
motor
carrier
listings
specifically
show
that
he
was
a
contract
carrier
and
that
was
done.
in
its
report,
the
commission
waives
the
ad
for
whatever
its
effect
may
have
upon
status.
the
commission
wasn't
concerned
with
holding-out.
the
commission
was
concerned
with
whether
or
not
there
were
too
many
contracts
and
too
little
specialization
because
that
is
what
it
requires
of
a
contract
carrier.
it
departed
from
the
test
of
common
carriage
and
did
not
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
that
test.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
that
is
not
the
statement
to
which
i'm
referring,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
but
when
the
commission
made
that
statement,
it
was
not
referring
to
--
to
my
statement
as
counsel
regarding
the
ad.
it
was
referring
to
the
statement
of
complainant's
counsel
to
the
effect
that
they
couldn't
make
a
case
without
having
representative
of
the
carrier
present
and
asking
the
commission
to
hold
an
investigation.
the
commission
did
not
hold
the
investigation
and
said
in
its
report
when
we
said
that
that
constituted
an
admission
that
they
could
not
make
a
prima
facie
case
that
such
a
statement
did
not
constitute
such
an
admission.
now,
there's
--
there
is
a
statement
in
the
commission's
report
with
respect
to
the
ad
and
--
and
that
is
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
the
commission's
report
starts
on
page
7
of
the
record
and
the
--
the
statement
to
which
i
have
reference
is
--
begins
on
page
12
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
before
reading
that
statement,
i
should
point
out
that
at
the
time
of
the
commission's
report
of
its
examiner,
we
took
exceptions
to
the
report.
and
regarding
these
matters
as
trivia,
we
filed
an
affidavit
showing
that
none
of
the
items
which
the
examiner
had
criticized
were
being
continued.
and
among
those
items
was
the
matter
of
this
ad
which
we
said
would
not
be
done
anymore
and
hadn't
been
done
since
prior
to
the
hearing.
it
is
with
reference
to
those
statements
that
the
commission
here
says,
at
the
bottom
of
page
12
of
the
record,
statements
one
and
seven
of
the
analysis
of
affidavit
are
not
relevant
to
the
issues.
and
here
is
the
crucial
statement,
“and
we
can
accept
statements
two,
three
and
four
and
six
as
covering
matters
which
have
been
accomplished
for
such
effect
as
they
may
have
upon
defendant's
carrier
status.”
now,
there's
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
and
the
appellee
admitted
at
the
outset
that
that
ad
was
bad
because
it
was
subject
to
misinterpretation
and
it
said
that
it
wanted
to
discontinue
it
that
it
had
been
done
without
the
advise
of
counsel
and
unwittingly
and
the
commission
accepted
that
statement
for
such
effect
that
it
had
upon
status.
in
addition,
the
commission
waived
everything
except
the
number
of
contracts.
the
statement
that
has
just
been
read
by
the
court
is
a
pertinent
statement
part
of
the
commission's
views
about
the
case,
but
you
have
to
read
this
report
as
a
whole.
and
when
you
read
it
as
a
whole,
beginning
with
page
1
and
again
on
page
3
and
again
on
page
7
all
the
way
through
the
report,
the
thing
that
is
talked
about
is
the
number
of
contracts
not
how
they
were
obtained.
it
is
the
amount
of
business
that
is
being
done
and
the
commission
expressly
applied,
explicitly
applied,
as
the
test
of
status
in
this
case,
its
so-called
specialization
test.
this
court
said
in
the
chenery
cases
that
you
can
only
go
upon
what
the
commission
has
said
was
the
basis
for
its
decision.
the
commission
here
said,
the
basis
for
its
decision
was
the
specialization
test.
if
it
--
if
the
basis
wasn't
--
was
not
a
holding-out
and
the
commission
said
it
was
not,
then
you
--
then
this
court,
under
the
chenery
case,
can
only
accept
what
the
commission
said.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
the
commission
said
as
to
the
matter
of
specialization
that
the
record
was
meager
and
the
evidence
was
scanty
but
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
showing
any
sufficient
specialization.
and
that
since
there
was
no
specialization,
the
number
of
contracts
must
be
held
to
a
minimum.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
despite
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
no,
it
does
not
go
to
the
commodities.
it
goes
to
the
service,
equipment,
training
of
employees
and
that
sort
of
thing.
the
specialization
test
is
a
dual
test,
an
alternative
test
which
on
the
one
hand
allows
the
alternative
of
only
a
few
contracts.
that
is
if
you
transport
some
material
like
iron
and
steel,
for
example,
it
doesn't
require
any
special
equipment.
you
can
only
have
a
few
contracts.
but
if
you
do
perform
some
special
service
on
the
other
hand
like
swing
up
the
poles
of
the
destination
or
some
other
--
have
some
special
equipment
like
a
tank
truck,
then
you
can
have
more
contracts.
the
commission
has
even
authorized
the
contract
carrier
which
had
a
thousand
contracts.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
no,
that
is
the
kind
of
specialization
they
are
talking
about,
but
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
they
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
they
gave
us
no
specialization.
what
my
brother
has
said
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
we
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
special
equipment.
the
long
bars
just
takes
a
long
flat
that
is
all
and
the
--
the
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
they
have
a
pole
trailer
where
--
where
the
pole
extends
four-and-a-half
to
length
in
the
trailer
for
the
long
poles.
but
the
point
is
whatever
may
have
been
shown
about
special
nature
of
services,
what
the
commission
did
when
it
granted
the
permit
was
to
grant
a
permit
to
do
--
perform
service
that
had
no
specialization
in
it.
they
authorized
as
the
record
shows
transportation
of
steel
articles
and
materials
used
or
useful
in
highway
construction
projects
and
the
like.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
there
is
no
chart
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
no,
there's
no
allegation
or
charge
anywhere
here
that
we
went
outside
the
scope
of
our
certificate.
we
held
to
the
commodities
we
were
entitled
to
carry.
we
held
to
the
territorial
scope.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
so
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
the
district
court
found
that
the
--
that
the
commission's
conclusion
that
we
were
acting
as
a
common
carrier
was
based
upon
test
that
was
not
--
that
was
contrary
to
the
statute.
the
court
made
no
independent
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
the
appellee
operated
as
a
common
carrier.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
if
you
found
evidence
here
to
sustain
a
conclusion
that
this
was
a
common
carrier,
i
think
you
still
would
have
to
affirm
the
court
below
because
under
the
chenery
cases,
this
court
will
not
sustain
a
commission
order
upon
a
ground
different
than
the
commission
itself
adopted.
you
do
not
do
in
this
court
with
the
commission
as
you
do
with
the
lower
court.
if
the
court
below
decided
the
case
in
the
right
way
for
the
wrong
reason,
you
will
affirm
the
court.
you
will
not
do
that
for
the
commission.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
when
you
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
you
--
i
think
you
will
have
to
find
it
and
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
when
you
read
the
report,
you
cannot
escape
so
find.
the
commission
here
changed
the
statute
to
read
quantitatively
instead
of
qualitatively.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
well,
what
exist
in
the
minds
of
counsel
might
be
different
from
what
comes
out
of
the
advocate,
[laughs].
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
in
the
minutes
remaining,
i
simply
desire
to
point
out
that
in
the
briefs
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
and
throughout
this
case,
the
parties
and
the
court
treated
the
most
important
question
in
the
case
of
being
the
validity
of
the
commission
specialization
test
returning
to
the
commission's
order
in
which
the
substance
of
all
this
argument
this
morning
began.
the
order
does
forbid
operation
as
a
common
carrier
and
as
learned
justice
said,
if
that
order
so
stated
related
to
a
concept
of
common
carriage
according
to
the
statutory
and
common
law
definition,
it
would
be
crystal
clear.
and
we
would
not
be
urging
that
the
order
is
void
for
vagueness.
it
looses
its
clarity
and
it
becomes
wholly
be
clouded
and
entirely
vague
because
the
order
is
not
related
to
the
statutory
definition
but
is
related
to
the
commission's
concept
of
specialization
and
few
contracts.
if
the
order
were
allowed
to
stand
therefore,
we
do
not
know
and
there
is
no
way
we
can
find
out
whether
with
this
kind
of
certificate
and
this
kind
of
specialization
which
we
have
by
virtue
of
what
the
commission
authorize,
we
are
allowed
one,
three,
five,
25
or
100
contracts.
we
can
cancel
any
number
of
our
contracts
in
attempted
compliance
but
no
matter
what
we
do,
short
of
canceling
them
all,
we
continue
the
rest
of
our
business
at
our
peril.
now,
the
principle
justification
and
i'm
still
talking
about
the
validity
of
the
commission's
test,
the
principle
justification
which
is
offered
by
the
government
for
this
test
which
is
different
from
the
statutory
test,
is
that
it's
a
reasonable
one.
this
is
a
--
to
require
contract
carriers
to
specialize
or
to
confine
themselves
to
a
few
contract
is
reasonable.
they
say,
under
the
purposes
of
the
--
of
the
statute.
the
trouble
with
that
is
that
reasonableness
of
a
--
to
pass
a
regulation
does
not
sustain
it's
validity
unless
the
agency
has
the
power
to
make
some
sort
of
a
test
or
adopt
some
sort
of
a
test
and
it
does
not
have
such
power
when
such
--
when
the
test
is
different
from
one
which
the
congress
has
laid
down.
they
rely
upon
the
brady
case,
and
i
--
we
have
answered
this
in
brief
but
i
want
to
emphasize
in
closing,
that
in
brady
where
they
had
a
reasonable
classification
of
common
carriers
that
--
between
tank,
truck,
household
goods
and
the
other
kinds
in
reasonable
classifications
of
contract
carriers.
there,
the
commission
was
acting
and
the
court's
approval
was
explicitly
grounded
upon
another
section
of
the
statute
which
explicitly
authorizes
the
commission
to
classify
carriers
within
the
statutory
definitions
of
contract
and
common
and
private
carriers.
they
do
not
have
any
such
power
with
respect
to
redefining
common
and
contract
carriage
which
is
what
they
appeared
on
and
on
which
this
order
is
based.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
the
statute
--
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
the
statute
provides
for
a
willful
violation
of
the
commission
order
of
penalties
of
$100
for
each
violation
and
everyday
is
a
separate
violation.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
after
the
order
goes
into
effect.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
oh,
yes,
the
order
contains
an
additional
paragraph
ordering
us
to
report
on
and
before
a
certain
date
under
oath
what
we
are
doing
to
comply
with
the
order.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
well,
we
not
only
would
be
willing
to
but
we
haven't
since
for
four
years
since
the
hearing.
and
so
if
there
was
anything
wrong
in
the
advertisement
that
is
so
long
test
and
accepted
by
the
commission
that
we
think
it
has
no
place
here.
mr.
robert
n.
burchmore
that
is
correct
and
the
order
was
entered
two
years
after
the
hearing,
two
years
after
the
advertising
that's
been
taken
out.
the
only
thing
left
to
say
about
that
advertisement
is
that
it
should
not
be
misunderstood
and
it
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
holding
out
--
unnecessary
holding
out
to
the
general
public.
i
admit
it
is
a
weak
point
in
the
case
and
that
the
advertisement
is
bad
because
it's
ambiguous.
but
if
that
--
that
advertisement
is
not
necessarily
a
holding
out
to
the
general
public
if
we
will
perform
service
for
all
who
come
in,
it
is
justice
susceptible
of
the
interpretation
that
is
that's
it's
only
an
advertisement
to
come
in
and
see
if
we
can
negotiate
a
contract
--
carrier
contract
with
whoever
reads
the
ad.
