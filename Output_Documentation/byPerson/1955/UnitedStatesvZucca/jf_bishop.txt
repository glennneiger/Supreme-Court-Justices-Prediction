mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
government
brought
this
case
to
this
court
because
it
felt
that
there
had
been
a
very
serious
misconstruction
of
a
statute
below.
the
statute
in
question
is
section
340
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
the
government
had
instituted
proceedings
under
that
section
against
the
respondent
to
revoke
his
naturalization
because
of
a
long
series
of
willfulness
representations
and
material
concealments
by
which
he
had
obtained
that
naturalization
in
the
first
place.
the
government
commenced
the
proceedings
by
filing
a
complaint.
in
that
complaint
the
text
of
the
misrepresentations
was
set
forth
at
length
and
there
was
also
a
section
in
which
the
government
alleged
there
had
been
good
cause
for
the
institution
of
these
proceedings.
but
the
judge
felt
that
in
addition
there
had
to
be
an
affidavit
of
good
cause.
now
very
briefly
the
government
feels
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
this
additional
affidavit.
the
government
feels
that
this
section
does
two
things.
first,
let
me
correct
my
--
let
me
insert
a
remark
here.
the
government's
position
is
that
the
only
reference
in
this
section
to
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
and
i'll
read
the
statute
in
a
moment,
is
in
the
part
in
which
an
affirmative
duty
is
imposed
on
the
united
states
attorneys
to
act
when
they
might
not
act
otherwise.
that's
where
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
appears.
the
government
feels
that
on
proper
construction
this
section
does
two
things.
first,
it
says
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
united
states
attorneys
will
institute
proceedings
for
denaturalization
and
it
says
when
that
duty
arises
upon
an
affidavit
of
good
cause.
and
the
second
part
of
the
section
separated
in
a
different
part
of
the
sentence
as
the
part
of
it
--
i
mean
an
entirely
different
paragraph
as
to
the
rest
tells
what
the
benefits
for
the
defendants
are
to
be.
that
is
it
affirmatively
and
clearly
sets
forth
a
60-day
notice
provision.
now
that
is
the
government's
feeling
about
it
and
perhaps
the
best
way
to
get
at
that
is
to
present
the
statute
before
the
court
and
i'll
take
the
liberty
of
reading
it
and
i'll
try
to
read
it
without
any
inflection
and
without
any
slanting
if
i
can
do
so.
it's
presented
in
the
government
brief
at
page
2,
if
you
have
that
before
you
and
i
read,
“it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorneys
for
the
respective
districts
upon
affidavit
showing
good
cause
therefore
to
institute
proceedings
in
any
court
specified
in
subsection
(a)
of
this
--
subsection
310
of
this
title,
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
naturalized
person,
citizen
may
reside
at
the
time
of
bringing
suit,
for
the
purpose
of
revoking
and
setting
aside
the
order
admitting
such
person
to
citizenship
and
canceling
a
certificate
of
naturalization
on
the
ground
that
such
order
and
certificate
of
naturalization
were
procured
by
concealment
of
a
material
fact
or
by
willful
misrepresentation.”
now
there
are
asterisks
in
the
government's
copy
and
what
follows
in
those
asterisks
there
is
some
language
as
to
the
effect
of
the
revocation
and
a
special
provision
concerning
contempt
of
court
as
an
additional
ground
for
revocation.
and
then
that
next
sentence
as
you
can
observe
as
a
provision
for
the
defendants
that
are
not
residing
in
the
united
states
and
then
there
is
the
separate
paragraph
b
and
again
i
start
reading
that's
on
page
3.
(b)
the
party
to
whom
was
granted
the
naturalization
alleged
to
have
been
procured
by
concealment
of
a
material
fact
or
by
willfulness
representation
shall
in
any
such
proceedings
under
subsection
(a)
of
this
section
have
60
days
personal
notice
unless
waived
by
such
party.
the
rest
of
it
i
don't
believe
i
need
to
read
because
the
contrast
of
that
second
part
with
the
first
part
is
now
before
the
court.
i
have
outlined
somewhat
roughly
how
this
case
arose,
that
is
the
proceeding
was
commenced
by
a
formal
complaint
in
which
the
government
charged
the
willfulness
representations
by
which
the
naturalization
was
originally
obtained.
and
the
statute
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
pardon
me.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
is
right.
that
--
this
is
clearly
under
this
section
and
i
might
add
also
that
the
60-day
notice
that
was
given
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
jurisdiction
was
in
the
court
of
the
residence,
of
the
defendant,
here.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
respondent.
now,
the
respondent
had
these
objections
to
the
complaint.
they
were
two
fold.
one
of
them
is
before
this
court,
the
other
is
not.
the
first
one
is
not.
but
i
have
to
mention
it
because
the
respondent
added
it
to
the
statement
of
facts
in
his
brief
so
i
don't
want
to
go
ahead
with
the
argument
without
having
that
here
too.
he
contented
first
that
the
complaint
failed
to
give
fair
notice
of
the
government's
claim
and
then
his
second
contention
was
that
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
an
affidavit
of
good
cause.
now
that
first
point
was
decided
against
the
respondent
by
a
judge
who
as
you
know
decided
for
him
on
the
other
ground.
that
point
isn't
before
the
court
but
since
it's
been
injected
and
also
since
it's
referred
to
tangentially
in
another
part
of
respondent's
brief,
i
feel
the
court
should
have
the
answer
to
it
that
the
judge
himself
made.
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
again
is
to
read
from
the
record.
he
said
that
there
was
no
lack
of
detail
and
here
is
his
language
when
he
talked
about
the
complaint
which
was
filed
in
this
proceeding,
i'm
reading
the
judge's
words,
record
12.
i
read,
“it
sets
forth
the
alleged
act
which
made
the
procurement
of
defendant's
naturalization
illegal
and
he
allegedly
concealed
and
misrepresented
facts
with
what
well
maybe
unnecessary
specificity
for
a
civil
complaint.
in
view
of
this
it
would
appear
that
the
defendant
is
merely
saying
that
a
better
complaint
should
have
been
drawn.
however
it
is
not
the
function
of
this
court
to
pass
on
the
artistic
merits
of
pleadings,”
citing
the
case.
the
complaint
not
only
gives
the
defendant
fair
notice
of
the
government's
claim,
but
it
also
informs
him
of
the
alleged
facts
upon
which
that
claim
is
based.
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
because
it
is
procedurally
inadequate
is
therefore
denied.
and
that
has
not
been
brought
to
the
court.
now
the
point
is
of
collateral
interest,
although
we
didn't
try
to
make
use
of
it
in
our
brief.
we
make
use
of
it
now
somewhat,
i
would
say
in
retaliation.
it's
of
interest
because
it
shows
that
the
demand
for
an
affidavit
clearly
doesn't
rest
on
any
need
for
detail
that
the
respondent
was
not
deprived
of
any
detail
here
and
the
judge
who
had
him
before
his
bench
could
see
that
very
clearly.
the
demand
for
filing
an
affidavit
in
this
case
rests
upon
the
narrow
contention
that
the
statute
some
how
requires
it
in
every
case
and
irrespective
of
any
duplication
or
additional
litigation
that
it
may
cause
impractical
effect.
now
i
do
not
say
that
if
the
statute
requires
it
that
he
shouldn't
have
it,
but
i
do
say
that
there
is
no
lack
of
detail
or
extraneous
reason
to
give
it
to
him
if
he
doesn't
have
it
on
the
words
of
a
statute
which
i
have
just
read,
which
we
think
it
does
not.
now
with
respect
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes,
and
i
will
deal
with
that.
but
i'd
add
a
purpose
which
the
chief
justice
probably
adverts
to
is
to
perhaps
add
some
element
of
responsibility,
i
want
to
discuss
that
at
greater
length
and
i
also
want
to
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
discuss
that
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
at
a
later
point
if
i
may.
now
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
pardon?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
an
assistant
u.s.
attorney
and
since
that
is
here
before
us
at
the
moment
i
want
to
add
that
when
a
complaint
is
signed
by
the
united
states
attorney,
under
the
federal
rules
of
several
procedure
number
11,
we
have
cited
that
in
our
brief,
that
in
itself
is
an
affirmation
of
good
cause.
i
don't
know
how
you
could
get
a
better
word.
but
again
i
am
not
arguing
it
on
any
theory
that
he
is
getting
something
just
as
good.
i
am
arguing
that
there
is
no
extraneous
reason
to
give
it
to
him,
if
it
doesn't
get
on
the
statute.
this
was
a
complaint
filed
by
the
united
states
attorney.
there
is
a
verification
of
it
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
and
if
we
were
discussing
in
on
just
as
good
basis,
i
have
no
doubt
that
everything
that's
required
would
be
there.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
we
are
construing
a
statute.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
correct.
that
is
right.
now,
with
--
and
that
is
the
point
in
which
the
district
judge
we
felt
went
astray.
now,
he
held
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
will
add
that
with
utmost
pleasure,
because
the
court
of
appeals
here
had
the
case
before
them
i
am
sure
and
i've
examined
the
briefs.
and
i
don't
want
to
say
that
their
decision
because
they
wrote
no
opinion.
it
is
lacking
in
consideration
but
i
will
charge
them
with
the
same
errors
and
manifest
omissions,
which
i
am
going
to
present
to
the
court
in
a
moment
in
what
is
supposed
to
be
here
a
very
careful
and
complete
analysis
of
legislative
history.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
they
did
and
that
is
always
a
dangerous
process
in
this
time
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
all
right.
now,
the
district
judge
whose
opinion
then
is
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
well
is
thinking
to
the
extent
that
i
may
summarize
it
only
a
little
to
present
it
before
this
court,
i
hope
i
am
properly
generous
about
it,
was
relied
preponderantly
on
the
legislative
history.
we
do
not
find
in
his
opinion
the
hard
day
labor
of
looking
at
the
statute
and
checking
its
words.
but
we
find
instead
an
excursion
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
serious
of
assumptions,
the
first
assumption
is
that
legislative
history
required
the
furnishing
of
an
affidavit
in
every
case.
now,
that
i
am
going
to
deal
with
when
i
get
to
the
legislative
history.
but
then
from
that
as
a
springboard
he
stated
that
this
affidavit
must
then
be
filed
in
court.
now
that's
an
assumption
that's
easily
to
be
made
by
saying
that
the
defendant
doesn't
have
a
chance
to
check
the
matter
if
it
isn't
filed
in
the
court.
but
it
does
overlook
and
the
district
judge
had
very
little
to
say
about
how
much
additional
procedure
that
involves
and
the
question
whether
the
congress
when
it
imposes
yet
another
virtually
a
third
bite
at
the
apple
of
effects
would
say
so
in
just
and
aside
with
this
few
words
inserted
in
the
first
part
of
the
statute.
now,
the
government's
--
let
me
summarize
a
moment
what
the
government
finds
in
error
in
this.
the
first
error
of
course
is
this
business
of
bypassing
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
of
which
i
find
no
mention
in
the
opinion
below
to
get
into
legislative
history.
the
second
of
course
is
in
the
use
made
of
legislative
history
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
district
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
district
judge.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
--
i
say
this
that
the
district
judge
did
not
mention
or
deal
with
the
contrast
of
the
first
part
of
this
statute
with
the
second
part.
the
first
part
before
it
says
institute
proceedings
that
first
part
which
says
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney
upon
affidavit
of
good
cause
to
institute
proceedings
and
then
after
that
--
after
you
got
into
the
point
where
that
instituting
of
proceedings
has
began
then
you
get
to
the
question
of
venue
and
then
you
get
to
the
provision
fully
spelled
out
not
parenthetically
for
a
notice.
it
says
in
this
proceeding
there
shall
be
a
notice.
it
doesn't
say
what
we
and
the
government
feel
and
i
am
paraphrasing
now,
i
am
not
reading
the
statute,
feel
that
when
the
united
states
attorney
is
furnished
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
he
has
to
act
and
that
that
was
purpose
of
putting
this
in.
now
that
is
the
distinction
which
isn't
discussed
in
the
opinion
below.
i
think
it
needs
very
shortly
to
be
discussed
when
you
see
such
a
contrast
of
language
within
one
section.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
say
that
that
affidavit
is
the
way
of
making
the
united
states
attorney
act
when
he
won't
act
of
his
own
accord.
but
that
is
what
that
is
for.
the
requirements
of
the
proceeding
are
in
the
second
part.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
if
they
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
no.
my
suggestion
is
just
the
reverse
that
in
most
cases
the
united
states
attorney
can
act
on
his
own
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
findings
and
information.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
right.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
anyone
who
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
sounds
funny
to
me,
too.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
what
i'm
--
what
i
mean
by
that
is
this
that
the
united
states
attorney
is
charged
and
in
actual
practice
carries
on
the
duty
of
denaturalization
proceedings,
the
usual
routine
as
this
court
knows
from
the
maker
argument
is
that
the
actual
exploratory
investigations
starts
over
in
the
bureau
of
immigration
and
naturalization.
they
send
memorandum,
they
sent
affidavits,
they
send
anything
that
he
requires
for
going
ahead.
no
doubt
about
that.
but
the
u.s.
attorney
is
the
one
who
normally
can
start
these
things
and
he
does
not
have
to
be
pushed
into
it,
he
does
not
require
an
affidavit.
and
this
particular
peculiar
portion
of
the
first
part
of
statute
is
only
for
the
instance
were
he
will
not
act
and
yet
action
should
be
taken
and
should
be
compelled
and
that
is
what
that
is
for.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
is
the
case.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
this
is
not
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
it's
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that's
my
position.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
will
give
a
short
answer
to
that
and
then
a
longer
answer.
the
first
answer
of
course
is
quick.
i
have
not
explored
all
the
other
statutes
and
my
word
on
whether
there
are
any
others
would
not
be
helpful
although
in
the
mechanics
of
the
tax
laws
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
something
very
close
to
that.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
but
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
will
not
end
the
extent
of
information,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
i
will
say
this,
that
my
not
knowing
about
it
is
meaningless
before
this
court
but
i
do
want
to
go
on
to
the
longer
part
of
the
answer.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
statute
that
had
such
a
legislative
history
as
this
one
in
which
there
was
such
choice
comment
about
the
lassitude
and
the
crookedness
of
united
states
attorneys
as
the
section
in
which
this
originated.
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
bindczyck
stated
the
whole
flagrant
annoys
some
history
of
the
origin.
so
that
my
saying
that
i
don't
know
of
any
other
case
in
which
u.s.
attorneys
had
to
be
brought
at
a
time
is
particularly
meaningless
in
the
face
of
the
way
this
statute
originated.
there
was
such
suspicion,
i've
just
--
was
reading
in
the
old
congressional
globe
the
other
evening
such
remarks
about
the
probable
use
of
these
statutes
and
the
lack
of
use
of
them
has
appalled
me
just
as
a
matter
of
language.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
so
that
that
differentiates
this
statute
and
that's
fine
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
then
you
have
added
another
authority
to
my
board.
however
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
pardon
me.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
statute
but
i
will
thank
mr.
justice
clark
for
another
addition
to
my
board.
that
board
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
surely.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
is
not
necessary
because
he
has
that
authority
already.
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
what?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
is
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that's
right,
he
--
in
other
words
and
let
me
add
just
one
little
aside
here
on
so
that
i
can
clean
this
up
in
a
second.
in
the
--
that
general
authority
was
considered
in
existence
even
at
the
time
when
this
enactment
first
appeared
in
1906.
there
are
citations
both
in
the
respondent's
brief
and
ours
in
which
there
was
a
general
practice
of
acquittal
proceedings
by
which
the
u.s.
attorneys
acted.
i
might
also
refer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
bindczyck
for
that.
so
that
what
we
have
is
a
power
in
the
united
states
attorneys,
but
we
do
have
a
peculiar
provision
at
the
beginning
of
it
to
make
the
united
states
attorneys
act
and
i
will
show
in
the
history
why
they
felt
there
had
to
be
these
compulsions
and
i
have
had
the
addition
of
at
least
one
similar
incidence
apparently
which
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
not
explored
here
before
us,
an
analogy.
now,
the
--
i
am
still
on
the
point
of
my
objection
to
the
opinion
below
the
error,
the
first
part
of
course
is
the
failure
to
distinguish,
the
clean
break
in
the
first
part
of
this
statute
from
the
second
part.
the
second
part
uses
language
that
no
one
would
have
any
trouble
with,
it
says,
as
i
read,
that
the
defendant
shall
have
60
days
notice.
that's
the
way
to
say
it.
but
you
don't
say
that
if
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
is
filed
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney
to
act.
now
i
know
i
am
transposing
the
words
there
somewhat
but
that's
the
pitch.
now,
the
second
objection
that
i
have
in
the
opinion
is
really
a
better
personal
one
and
that
is
that
this
has
been
an
attempt
to
make
an
excursion
into
a
legislative
history
which
i
don't
think
was
necessary
on
the
language
and
it
was
left
badly
incomplete.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes,
sir
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
there
is
documentation
for
that
in
our
view
of
the
legislative
history.
now,
may
i
say
to
the
court,
i'm
going
to
start
momentary
comment
on
legislative
history
here
and
before
i
say
anything
about
legislative
history,
may
i
make
the
profession
of
modesty
on
the
subject.
we
all
know
that
legislative
history
is
a
difficult
and
dangerous
thing.
we
know
that
even
though
the
law
and
current
decisions
in
1952
when
this
was
reenacted
were
almost
unanimously
to
the
effect
that
i
have
just
stated
that
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
i
am
not
saying
that
every
legislator
in
congress
read
that
history
or
even
adverted
to
the
matter.
that
is
--
i'm
not
that
naïve
but
so
long
as
we
are
challenged
as
to
what
i
consider
here
to
be
the
normal
way
of
reading
this
language
and
are
thrown
into
a
legislative
history,
we
have
to
operate
as
a
profession
of
faith
i
suppose
that
the
legislators
acted
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
of
that
time
perhaps
or
in
reference
to
them,
even
though
they've
never
read
them
and
also
with
reference
to
the
history
although
very
few
people
i
find
have
ever
explored
this
to
the
beginning
as
it
should
have
been.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
very
much
so,
i
--
let
me
digress
again
for
a
moment
and
because
i
may
not
get
to
it.
in
1952
when
this
statute
was
enacted,
here
was
the
judicial
history.
there
was
a
case,
schwinn
in
1940
which
i
consider
of
the
highest
authority
because
i
mean
ranking
them
somewhat
is
likely
to
have
been
heard
of,
because
it
had
gotten
to
this
court.
the
schwinn
case
we
have
cited
in
the
brief
was
a
case
in
which
an
affidavit
was
filed
with
the
complaint
but
there
was
an
objection
in
the
court
of
appeals
level
that
they
had
to
--
that
they
had
to
furnish
that
affidavit
to
the
u.s.
attorney.
and
it
was
squarely
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
squarely
decided
we
think,
not
just
dictum
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
is
not
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
we've
cited
the
language
in
our
brief.
i
don't
want
to
take
time
for
it
now,
but
that
case
came
before
this
court.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
was
either
so
persuasive
or
the
logic
of
it
when
one
looks
at
the
statute
i
don't
know
why,
but
the
defendant
in
that
case
didn't
even
bring
the
argument
about
the
affidavit
to
this
court,
so
that
you
are
properly
entitled
to
say
that
this
court
did
not
pass
upon
the
matter.
but
nevertheless
this
court
did
sustain
the
revocation
and
i
think
that
this
court
with
its
occasional
proclivity
for
acting
sua
sponte
and
in
view
of
the
seriousness
with
which
this
court
has
looked
at
all
revocation
cases,
i
don't
think
this
court
missed
the
point.
i
think
the
point
was
there
to
see
especially
for
anyone
who
looked
at
the
lower
court
briefs
and
this
court
affirmed
a
revocation
in
which
there
had
been
an
issue
below
and
in
which
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
which
was
before
this
court
squarely
said
this
affidavit
is
not
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
period.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
that
we
are
arguing
about
now.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
--
that
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
it
was
filed
with
the
complaint
but
the
objection
below
was
as
it's
contented
in
the
district
judge
here
below
that
a
--
that
the
--
that
it's
a
matter
that
has
to
be
furnished
to
the
united
states
attorney
before
he
can
institute
the
proceedings
so
that
the
case
i
think
is
quite
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
in
the
schwinn
case?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
don't
recall.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
don't
recall
but
it
was
an
affidavit
of
good
cause.
it
was
not
furnished
to
the
united
states
attorney.
may
i
make
a
guess?
i
suppose
it
was
just
the
usual
immigration
department
affidavit
which
comes
in
along
with
the
papers
to
get
the
action
started
in
our
procedures.
but
i
do
not
state
that
from
knowledge.
i
did
read
the
record
and
have
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
because
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
the
affidavit
being
filed
in
the
proceedings
is
not
enough.
if
you
agree
with
the
district
judge
below
the
united
states
attorney
has
to
be
furnished
with
an
affidavit
to
start
the
proceedings.
that
isn't
remedy
by
filing
it
later
in
the
proceedings.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
with
the
complaint.
with
the
complaint
but
it
was
added
to
the
complaint
later.
i
can
go
into
greater
detail
on
that
because
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
this
whole
process
is
a
matter
of
cutting
it
fine
if
they
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
i
think
that's
a
logical
statement
but
this
thing
is
not
being
handled
logically.
i
would
say
--
in
fact
one
of
the
complaints
of
the
respondent
here
is
that
this
is
a
--
and
we're
sympathetic
to
that,
that
is
that
starting
at
denaturalization
proceeding,
just
starting
it,
getting
the
wheels
in
motion
is
something
that's
a
very
serious
business.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
that
is
--
that
is
saying
that
what
is
claimed
here
to
be
a
jurisdictional
requirement
can
be
repaired
after
jurisdiction
should
have
attached.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
if
it
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement
that
is
to
appear
sometime
in
the
proceeding
but
if,
as
respondent
contends
here,
it's
a
jurisdictional
requirement
peculiarly
addressed
to
nothing
being
started,
not
even
papers
being
filed.
they
speak
of
the
damage
to
reputation
and
all
that.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
then
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
what's
that?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes
i
have
looked
at
it
and
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
and
there
was
--
there
was
so
much
dispute
over
the
affidavit
that
i
cannot
conceive
of
this
court
having
overlooked
without
even
a
caveat,
the
fact
that
this
proceeding
in
schwinn
was
not
started
with
an
affidavit
of
good
cause.
and
if
it
was
brought
in
later,
it
would
not
meet
the
requirements
which
the
respondents
seem
to
feel
is
of
the
essence
here.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
will
speak
to
that
point.
it
was
--
when
it
specified
the
ground
it
was
not
saying
that
the
court
said
nothing
about
the
affidavit.
what
it
said
was
that
it
said
nothing
about
fraud,
there
were
two
grounds
in
schwinn
and
i
forgot
which
it
was,
illegality
or
fraud.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
--
the
--
the
specific
ground
of
two
but
it
did
not
say,
as
i
read
it
of
course,
that
it
said
we
--
we
sustain
this
revocation
because
of
shall
we
say
illegality
but
we
do
not
say
anything
about
the
affidavit.
the
specification
of
illegality
was
because
there
had
been
quite
a
bit
of
brawling
about
fraud
as
well,
i
remember
that
clearly.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
so
that
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
is
not
a
secret
to
me.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
1907,
the
attorney
general's
letter
you're
speaking
to
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
all
right.
well,
i
--
i
will
say
this.
we
have
said
perhaps
the
most
eloquent
say
about
that
letter
by
printing
in
the
appendix
the
whole
correspondence
of
which
it
was
a
part.
that
was
not
an
opinion
of
an
attorney
general
in
formal
style.
it
was
a
haste
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
in
formal
style
in
the
sense
of
the
published
opinions
of
the
attorney
general.
it
--
it
appears
in
the
correspondence
of
a
--
as
a
quick
answer
to
dispose
of
a
single
case.
i
might
paraphrase,
phrase
it
in
the
vernacular
by
saying
that
the
bureau
set
over
a
group
of
papers
asking
the
district
attorney
in
new
jersey
to
start
something.
the
district
attorney
couldn't
find
the
fellow.
that's
appear
--
appears
on
the
appendix.
and
along
with
his
objection
that
he
couldn't
find
him,
he
sends
back
remark
also
under
the
statute
we
should
have
an
affidavit.
someone
in
the
attorney
general's
office,
(inaudible)
the
original
says
refer
to
cooley,
writes
a
letter
to
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
cooley,
c-o-o-l-e-y.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that's
right.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
i
mentioned
that
though
because
it
was
not
(inaudible),
the
man
who
had
served
on
the
naturalization
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
--
i
have
read
that.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
would
say
that
it
was
a
hasty
interdepartmental
disposition
of
a
single
question.
but
i
also
wish
to
point
out
that
the
letter
itself
is
not
too
clear
especially
when
it's
read
in
the
correspondence.
it
speaks
of
authority
to
act,
and
it
speaks
of
filing
an
affidavit,
though
the
word
‘filing'
is
in
there.
but
in
the
whole
context
of
this
correspondence
you
will
note
that
the
attorney
general
did
not
answer
the
question
which
was
squarely
put,
is
it
unlawful
to
start
this
proceeding
without
the
affidavit?
it
shows
on
all
sides
a
quick
dealing
with
the
question.
but
let
me
assume
that
that
1907
letter
is
a
formal
and
let's
say
that
in
the
seven
days
of
its
answer,
it
was
a
well
considered
letter
and
represented
the
opinion
that
time.
it
has
not
been
the
administrative
practice
as
a
universal
matter
since.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
i
have
an
example,
the
knight
case
was
in
1923,
there
was
no
affidavit
filed
then.
and
that
knight
case
which
we
cite
said
they
didn't
have
to,
it
was
not
jurisdictional
so
it
certainly
occurred
as
early
as
that.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
now
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
they
did
until
1927
and
then
the
matter
died,
and
let
me
--
let
me
condition
that
too.
i
don't
think
the
third
and
the
fifth
did
much
of
a
job
of
following
the
reasoning
of
the
attorney
general's
letter
so
much
as
they
did
to
espouse
the
fact
that
in
those
particular
cases
they
just
refused
to
denaturalize
because
of
a
small
court
error.
they
went
to
the
merits
and
the
matter
that
--
the
affidavit
part
that
came
in
very
parenthetically,
an
examination
of
those
opinions
will
show
very
clearly
that
they
were
directed.
that
that
affidavit
talk
was
thrown
in
as
a
make
way
without
any
consideration,
they
didn't
refer
to
the
attorney
general's
letter
or
anything
else.
they
just
added
that
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
to
their
opinion
on
the
merits.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
district
of
columbia
case
is
the
1912
cohen
case.
that
did
nothing
but
quote
the
attorney
general's
letter
and
the
text
writer
who
had
in
turn
quoted
the
attorney
general's
letter
and
that
was
the
end
of
it.
meanwhile
in
knight,
the
knight
case,
it's
apparent
that
in
at
least
that
case,
there
was
no
affidavit
filed.
now
let
me
in
order
to
fill
this
in
a
little
more
frankly,
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
great
number
of
cases
this
affidavit
is
final
and
there's
no
problem
of
finding
out
why
and
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
there's
been
any
recognition
that
the
government
feels
that
it
has
to
file
because
it
contested
the
matter
as
early
as
schwinn
in
1940
and
in
this
case
it
firmly
decided
not
to
go
on
with
that.
as
the
court
knows
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
instant
case
and
cases
before
which
are
cited
in
our
brief.
there's
a
whole
parade
of
them
and
they
are
recent
and
they
represent
the
position
of
the
department.
the
court
will
of
course
advert
to
half
a
dozen
reasons
why
rather
than
have
an
argument
about
something
which
is
usually
fairly
readily
available,
you
go
ahead
and
file
the
affidavit.
there
are
many
reasons
for
filing
it,
in
the
first
place
the
interdepartmental
procedure
as
this
court
knows
from
minker
is
to
do
a
very
careful
job
of
investigating
and
to
require
an
affidavit
within
the
department,
and
the
insertion
of
that
affidavit,
the
use
of
an
affidavit
is
a
very
common
practice.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
but
the
recognition
that
it
has
to
be
filed
is
not
a
common
practice.
and
the
only
evidence
of
such
recognition
is
that
1907
instance
which
i
have
not
found
in
any
of
the
manuals
or
routine
establishments.
i
have
for
instance
seen
as
far
back
as
1943,
a
departmental
memorandum
which
clearly
said
it's
up
to
each
united
states
attorney
if
they
want
to
file
the
affidavit,
they
can
but
they
don't
have
to
citing
schwinn
and
other
cases.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
what's
that?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
no
particular
reason
except
that
it
does
involve
this.
and
i
may
go
to
this
point
at
the
moment,
in
other
words
the
question
is,
you
have
affidavits
in
these
cases,
you
always
have
extent
--
i
think
it
will
be
conceded
that
there
is
extensive
investigation.
these
things
are
not
vigorously
filed.
why
not
go
ahead
and
give
it
to
them?
well
the
answer
to
that
is
this
and
i
speak
here
on
what
i've
been
told
by
those
at
the
actual
operational
levels,
that
that
affidavit
which
we
feel
is
not
required
by
the
statute
can
be
quite
a
bit
of
a
subject
of
nuisance,
it
can
involve
you
in
practically
a
third
preliminary
round
on
the
facts.
let
me
proceed
backwards
a
moment
as
to
this
number
of
rounds,
their
final
and
decisive
round
on
the
fact
of
course
is
when
you
go
to
trial,
you
present
your
witnesses
and
then
you
have
to
put
up
your
witnesses
and
there
is
the
examination
so
forth.
but
in
these
cases
there
is
a
bite
before
that.
as
soon
as
this
complaint
is
filed,
you
have
all
the
discovery
proceedings,
you
have
the
depositions
and
that
has
been
specifically
provided
by
the
congress
in
contrast
with
the
little
that's
provided
about
how
this
is
to
be
tried
out.
now
the
government
does
not
want
to
have
yet
a
third
earlier
go-round,
i
should
say
a
first
followed
by
two
more
by
filing
an
affidavit
having
the
lawyer
who
prepared
an
affidavit
within
the
department
and
who
is
not
going
to
be
a
witness,
hold
in
on
deposition,
taking
up
the
time
of
personnel
and
--
until
it
became
a
real
problem.
that
was
done
in
this
case.
you
will
find
in
the
record
a
document
which
the
attorney
who
verified
this
complaint
had
to
file
so
that
he
wouldn't
be
holding
and
have
his
time
wasted
by
asking
a
virtual
trial
on
the
facts
for
which
he
was
not
the
witness.
and
then
after
that
when
it
is
all
over
with,
then
to
have
another
go
around
on
depositions
and
discovery
and
then
finally
the
other
act.
that
is
the,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
real
reason
why
the
government
not
being
required
to
file
an
affidavit
has
put
a
stop
to
it
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
in
many
cases.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
respondent
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
respondent
asks
for
that.
there
is
of
course
a
question
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
my
answer
is
of
course
not.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
there
are
laws
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
the
lower
court
here
spoke
in
a
fashion
that
is
very
alarming
if
the
court
should
for
find
with
the
lower
court,
we
would
--
i
feel
assuredly,
possibly
have
a
very
extensive
third
go
around
on
the
facts.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
want
to
--
i'll
try
to
find
that
place.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
in
page
18
where
it
says
but
the
protection
afforded
by
the
requirement
of
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
would
be
seriously
impaired
if
the
defendant
in
a
denaturalization
action
could
not
examine
it
and
test
its
sufficiency
by
motion
before
trial.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
oh,
we
have
that
already
with
the
discovery
proceedings
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
and
the
depositions.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
administrative
demands
of
very
serious
input.
in
other
words,
your
first
step
then
--
this
third
step
that
i'm
--
that
would
be
added
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
may
i
interrupt
one
second?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
we
should
not
because
very
often
the
witnesses
cannot
be
induced
or
required
to
make
affidavits.
as
a
matter
of
fact
under
this
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
but
he
can
only
make
it
on
the
record.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
assumption
could
be
made.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
the
--
you
then
have
a
person
filing
a
document
in
a
proceeding
on
which
he
can
immediately
be
required
to
spend
time
to
no
good
purpose
which
is
duplicated
in
the
discovery
proceedings.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
it
isn't
a
matter
of
having
cards
up
your
sleeve
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
very
case,
if
you
will
look
at
the
verification
in
the
--
it
was
attached
to
this
complaint.
the
attorney
did
say
he
had
looked
over
the
files
and
that
was
why
this
proceeding
was
being
brought
but
the
u.s.
attorney
is
not
going
to
able
to
do
more
than
that.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
of
the
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
court
below
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
court
below
apparently
did
not
consider
it.
the
respondents
do
not.
if
you
will
examine
the
respondents
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
what's
that?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that
is
certainly
what
they
are
contending.
we
don't
even
--
we
don't
conceive
that
if
the
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
because
that's
a
duplication
of
the
discovery
proceedings.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well
our
contention
is
that
what
would
be
required
would
be
a
third
go
around
on
the
facts.
he
would
have
to
put
all
the
facts
in
there
and
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
as
a
result
of
that
it
would
be
just
duplicating
the
discovery
proceedings.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
but
that
go
around
is
added,
if
this
affidavit
is
something
in
addition
to
the
discovery
proceeding,
those
are
with
us.
congress
has
--
at
least
they're
in
the
rules,
in
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
you
--
you
have
a
person
examined
and
you
have
time
of
government
personnel
taken
which
they
can
ill
afford
which
has
gotten
to
that
nuisance
stage.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
not
for
an
instant
if
he
has
that
procedural
right.
but
if
he
does
not
have
that
procedural
right,
the
government
has
thought
that
this
is
an
end
of
a
good
thing
and
that
what
has
been
given
not
as
a
procedural
right
but
as
something
thrown
in
is
not
going
to
be
thrown
in
anymore.
if
we
conceded
that
it
were
a
procedural
right,
if
it
was
the
third,
or
the
fourth,
or
the
fifth
go
around
we
would
not
have
a
word
to
say
about
it.
but
we
say
first
that
the
right
is
not
given.
as
i
understand
the
question
from
the
court,
well,
why
don't
you
give
it
to
him
anyways,
there's
so
much
to
it,
the
answer
is
there's
enough
to
it,
to
make
it
stop
doing
what
we
don't
--
what
we
are
not
required
to
do
under
the
statute.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
a
great
number
of
reasons.
perhaps
the
best
demonstration
of
it
i
would
say
is
that
in
the
appendix
that
we
threw
here,
the
u.s.
attorney
rather
than
looking
up
to
statutory
things,
says,
send
us
an
affidavit,
it's
forwarded
on,
say
yes,
send
us
an
affidavit,
and
they
put
in
the
affidavit.
i
would
be
inclined
to
do
that
in
many
cases
myself
rather
than
to
go
into
a
question
which
is
surely
one
more
element
of
litigation,
one
more
round
of
having
someone
subpoenaed
in
to
answer
questions
which
are
not
of
any
great
help
to
the
proceedings.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
didn't
know
attorney
general
bonaparte.
i'm
not
speaking
of
him.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i'm
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
wouldn't
know
because
it
wouldn't
be
pertinent
to
my
argument.
my
argument
is
they
don't
have
to
do
it.
the
question
is
only
why
don't
they
do
it
as
a
matter
of
generosity?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
at
times
they'll
mend
themselves
to
generosity.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
no.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
say
that
it
is
a
third
round
but
i
say
that
in
answer
to
the
question,
why
don't
you
do
it
free?
i
don't
say
it
in
answer
to
the
question
why
do
you
have
to
do
it?
i
say
that
we
don't
--
that
it's
not
in
the
statute.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
--
i
would
say
that
it
puts
demands
on
personnel.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that's
why
they
stopped.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
have
just
recited
what
has
been
told
to
me
that
they
haul
in
the
attorneys
that
make
the
verifications
and
try
to
make
witnesses
out
of
them
when
they're
not
witnesses.
they
only
retell
the
facts
which
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
will
be
brought
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
they
try
to
--
they
try
to
subpoena
the
u.s.
attorney
here.
and
this
--
and
this
document
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
he
had
to
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
he
filed
--
he
had
to
file
yet
another
document.
when
those
are
multiplied
by
thousands
there's
an
end
to
all
good
things.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
do
not.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
am
not
acquainted
with
that.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
by
their
instructions
of
which
i
have
seen
them
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
including
for
instance
there
was
a
formal
memorandum
that
i'm
familiar
with
which
cited
schwinn
and
told
them
when
it's
--
when
it
will
assist
the
government,
when
it
will
assist
the
expediting
of
it,
file
the
affidavit
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
but
otherwise
you
do
not
have
to.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
united
states
attorney's
manual,
you
refer
to?
i
don't
know
whether
that
is
interdepartmental
matter
but
i
do
recall
--
i
think
i
am
allowed
to
say
this
much
that
i
did
check
that
manual
to
see
what
was
said
about
it
and
i
found
nothing
requiring
it.
and
in
the
light
of
this
earlier
memorandum
specifically
on
the
subject
i
found
a
definite
instruction
that
it
was
not
required
under
the
law.
they
had
the
legal
lights
exploring
it
and
that
they
didn't
have
to
do
it
unless
they
were
ordered
to.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
clearly,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
object.
i
think
it
shows
the
--
it
shows
itself
to
be
that
right
on
the
language
and
in
the
legislative
history
which
on
--
(inaudible)
i
don't
see
me
even
able
to
reach
unless
i'm
given
some
more
time.
it's
very
clear.
our
brief
has
--
has
lined
up
the
legislative
history
and
i
wanted
to
reserve
some
time
to
clarify
what
as
--
what
maybe
raised.
i
will,
therefore,
would
like
to
stop
now
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
five
bills
before
this
1906
congress
under
which
citizens
were
to
be
allowed
to
be
petitioners
in
these
proceedings,
specifically
again
the
report
of
the
--
this
is
all
in
the
brief,
specifically
again
the
report
in
which
the
committee
specifically
said
it
had
adverted
to
those
bills.
it
did
not
say
that
it
had
taken
this
or
that
provision
out
of
it
but
it
had
considered
that.
specifically
again
and
this
is
the
big
whole
of
the
decision
below,
after
15442,
which
is
the
forerunner
was
reported
out,
it
was
changed,
it
was
changed
in
several
respects
but
what
--
it
was
changed
for
instance
to
cut
out
venue
in
the
original
naturalizing
part
and
to
have
it
only
in
the
part
of
residence.
but
in
addition
to
that
the
language
was
changed
before
that
it
had
said
the
united
states,
this
is
in
our
brief,
it's
set
off
in
the
margin,
before
that
it
had
said
the
united
states
shall
have
power
upon
affidavit
of
any
credible
person
to
--
i
think
it
goes
on
to
institute
proceedings.
then
that
was
changed
without
any
explanation
except
as
we
find
clear
explanation
in
the
pressure
of
five
bills
to
read
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney
upon
affidavit
duly
filed.
now,
this
opinion
below
goes
up
to
the
point
of
quoting
the
language
about
power
upon
an
affidavit
and
stops
and
never
goes
on
to
this
very
significant
and
crucial
change,
said
not
a
word
about
it
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
it
does
not,
it
didn't
take
the
trouble
and
for
that
i
am
bitter
because
of
the
day
labor
involved
of
reading
those
bills
to
which
the
committee
adverted
and
seeing
the
substantial
pressure
of
bills
which
wanted
the
private
citizens
to
get
in
there
because
there
had
been
distrust
of
the
u.s.
attorneys,
that's
in
the
--
i
say
in
the
brief,
that's
a
lengthy
and
a
hard
process
and
has
to
be
lengthily
reviewed
but
if
that
will
be
considered,
it
will
give
the
explanation
of
the
change.
now,
may
--
just
one
caveat,
the
respondent
has
hypothesized
other
reasons
for
making
that
change
but
not
one
of
those
hypotheses
is
supported
by
anything
like
five
bills
which
show
the
pressure
to
let
the
outsiders
into
the
picture
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
the
force
of
the
act.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
if
they
didn't
present
an
affidavit,
this
would
stop
on
them,
and
that's
exactly
what
it's
for.
i
would
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
left.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
go
into
the
legislative
history.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
believe
i
have
three
minutes.
i'll
have
to
make
the
statements
very
quickly.
first,
as
to
the
information
requested
as
to
the
number
of
denaturalization
proceedings,
we
have
not
been
able
to
compile
that.
at
--
as
of
this
moment
that's
being
worked
on
and
will
be
sent
later
because
it's
not
classified
down
in
detail
to
that
extent.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
--
the
intent,
the
obvious
intent
of
the
congress
as
all
of
these
years
to
protect
from
the
admittedly
serious
matter
of
denaturalization.
the
question
is
not
rather
the
denaturalization,
the
matter
is
serious
but
what
did
the
congress
provide?
the
commission
whose
report
preceded
the
1906
legislation
said
nothing
about
an
affidavit
at
all
and
they
were
certainly
concerned
with
safeguards
because
they
put
in
the
notice
provision
for
that
purpose.
i
--
i
still
must
complain
as
i
complained
yesterday
that
that
great
gap
between
what
was
enacted
and
that
power
language
which
was
well
done
today
is
not
explained.
that
appears
on
the
government's
brief.
the
difference
in
the
language
appears
on
page
26
of
the
government's
brief.
we
have
set
it
forth
in
the
margin.
the
language
which
had
said
the
united
states
shall
upon
affidavit
made
by
any
credible
person,
have
the
power
to
institute
proceedings,
language
which
could
indicate
that
the
power
is
conditioned
on
it
was
changed
to
read
into
an
entirely
different
thing,
we
think,
making
it
a
duty
that
said
--
and
that
change
is,
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
district
attorneys
for
the
--
for
the
respective
districts
upon
affidavit
showing
good
cause
therefore
to
institute
proceedings.
there
is
no
explanation
of
that
change
in
terms
of
saying
that
they
wanted
to
cut
out
the
additional
jurisdiction
because
they
could
do
that
and
did
that
by
a
slight
change
in
the
second
part
of
the
sentence.
but
in
the
first
part,
there
has
been
a
material
change.
we
have
only
hypothesis
to
explain
that
change
and
we
have
presented
the
fact
that
there
were
before.
this
congress,
three
bills
and
before
the
preceding
congress,
two
bills
which
had
given
the
citizen,
an
outside
citizen,
the
right
to
present
a
natural
--
denaturalization
proceeding.
that's
why
we
think
this
was
a
change
to
make
it
a
duty
and
that
it
was
to
that
duty
that
the
affidavit
related,
that
the
united
states
attorney
could
not
be
enforced
to
act.
i
want
to
hurry
on
to
one
more
thing.
i
take
it
as
a
question
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
am
i
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
permitted
to
answer
that?
mr.
j.f.
bishop
thank
you.
yes,
sir.
i
will
disagree
with
the
chief
justice
on
his
first
assumption.
i
have
just
stated
that
that
commission
on
which
the
department
of
justice
was
represented
specifically
did
not
do
anything
about
this
--
an
affidavit
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kind.
all
they
presented
was
a
power
language
and
they
showed
very
clearly
what
protections
they
had
in
mind.
they
put
in
a
notice
provision.
the
affidavit
did
not
come
in
with
that
permission
on
which
the
united
states
attorney
was
represented.
as
to
your
second
point
we
are
fated
to
disagree.
i
consider
the
routine
rather
hastily
considered
things
which
has
been
brought
since
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
in
better
consideration.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
do
not
think
so.
in
fact
the
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
no,
i
--
may
i
correct
the
--
any
of
misimpression
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
that
i
might
have
given.
i
do
not
think
that
that
--
that
that
letter
when
it
is
read
carefully
in
connection
with
the
correspondence
really
answers
or
really
deals
with
the
thing
on
any
broad
basis
and
the
attorney
general
spoke
very
clearly
about
protecting
against
the
--
the
institution
of
proceedings
by
people
lacking
in
responsibility.
and
that
seem
to
me
the
essence
of
his
letter
if
i
may
turn
to
that
a
moment
because
i
want
to
point
that
out
and
that
i
believe
it's
inconsistent.
it
appears
on
the
--
in
our
brief
in
page
31
where
we
have
quoted
the
entire
letter.
and
i
notice
there
that
he
says
the
object
of
the
provision
undoubtedly
is
to
protect
holders
of
certificates
from
annoyance
and
attorneys
from
unnecessary
labor
as
a
result
of
mere
complaints
by
individuals
unable
to
produce
evidence
and
unwilling
to
assume
the
responsibility
therefore.
a
u.s.
attorney
who
files
a
complete
complaint
of
this
kind
signs
his
name
to
it
and
is
willing
to
go
ahead
is
not
an
individual
unable
to
produce
evidence
and
unwilling
to
assume
responsibility.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
again
the
problem
of
informal
language
authorized
by
whom?
that
in
the
statute
or
by
the
department
to
proceed
as
well
as
involved
there.
the
second
thing,
he
should
be
furnished
an
attorney
general
who
is
writing
a
precise
and
inclusive
discussion
of
this
matter
wouldn't
say
furnished
if
he
meant
that
it's
to
be
filed
in
the
court
if
that's
what
they
have
been
talking
about.
lastly,
the
last
item
on
which
the
proceedings
may
be
based,
is
he
talking
about
what
is
will
so
fully
discussed
in
the
minker
case
for
the
u.s.
attorney
to
based
action
on
it?
or
did
it
mean
that
the
statute
said
that
it
must
be
based?
again
and
again,
the
statute
could've
been
precise
on
that.
there
is
easy
language.
that
is
why
i
object
to
the
acceptance
of
an
informal
letter
as
decisive
of
the
thing
and
again
i
must
repeat
that
that
has
been
discarded
since
and
is
certainly
not
so
considered
today.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
--
the
forerunner
of
this
act
was
1906.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
this
letter
was
nine
months
later.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
surely.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
two
answers.
first,
i
do
not
know
exactly.
second,
the
knight
case
1923
already
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
said
--
apparently
no
affidavit
was
filed
but
we
say
that
it
isn't
required
anyway.
that's
1923
already.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
knight.
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
so
as
of
1923
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
routine.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
--
i
would
not
know.
i
--
as
a
matter
of
--
off
the
record
a
moment,
i
read
that
available
correspondence
that
was
furnished
to
me
at
my
request
by
archives
and
by
our
files.
i
don't
know
how
completely
they
garnered
everything
that
was
available.
but
i
read
all
of
that
material
and
i
found
very
--
nothing
on
the
matter
because
far
from
the
attorney
general
having
concerned
himself
much
with
this
and
he
being
in
authority,
he
had
referred
everything
over
to
that
committee
on
naturalization
upon
which
one
member
was
sitting.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
and
that's
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
that's
why
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
would
not
know
that.
as
i
say
i
am
--
my
efforts
define
that
have
been
nullified.
i
do
know
that
rather
far
back,
in
1943
this
i
have
actually
seen
the
memorandums,
to
department
which
explored
this
very
fully
at
least
as
well
as
he
could
and
it
of
course
followed
schwinn
and
that
left
it
to
the
united
states
attorneys,
they
could
file
or
they
could
not
file.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
are
there
are
other
questions
about
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
was
is
it
(inaudible)
mr.
j.f.
bishop
well,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question.
i
--
i
interpret
the
opinion
below
as
having
made
a
multiple
decision.
first,
that
the
attorney
--
the
united
states
attorney
must
be
furnished
an
affidavit.
and
then
since
he
must
be
furnished
an
affidavit
that
that
must
be
filed
in
court.
the
government's
position
is
that
the
attorney
--
that
the
united
states
attorney
is
not
deprived
by
this
statute
of
acting
upon
his
own
information
and
proceeding
upon
that
if
he
considers
himself
to
have
a
proper
case.
now
in
this
case
of
course
it's
clear
that
he
acted
under
three
--
section
340.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
but
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
the
record
does
not
show
it
and
he
said
he
did
not
have
to
have
it
if
he
had
better
advices
given
at
that
time.
but
what
i
do
answer
is
that
this
was
brought
under
section
340
so
that
the
government's
position
is
we
have
to
comply
with
what
section
340
calls
for
but
we
insist
that
section
340
calls
specifically
and
clearly
for
the
notice
provisions
and
it
specifies
the
venue.
but
all
that
it
says
about
an
affidavit
is
with
respect
to
that
mandatory
portion
which
says
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney
to
act
upon.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
we
do
not
contend
in
this
case
that
it
does.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
we
do
not
raise
that
point.
that
is
very
clear.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
apparent
--
that
--believe
me
to
my
final
utterance
in
which
i've
been
delayed
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
--
and
that
is
this
that
we
needed
no
better
demonstration
than
the
questioning
here
to
indicate
what
a
genuine
additional
go
around
is
going
to
be
required.
we
have
not
formulated
and
we
would
resist
i
am
sure
if
this
--
if
this
court
merely
said
that
an
affidavit
is
required.
we
would
certainly
resist
the
idea
that
it
would
--
could
go
to
the
extent
of
requiring
every
witness
for
instance
to
make
an
affidavit.
and
yet
from
the
respondent's
brief,
i
don't
know
how
far
they
would
go
and
how
plaguing
a
procedure
this
would
be
and
how
many
more
go
arounds.
i
spoke
yesterday
about
the
inroads
on
the
government
personnel
but
that
is
not
the
real
difficulty
of
this.
if
congress
had
intended
that
there
should
be
this
additional
delay
intrinsic
in
having
an
affidavit
it
certainly
wouldn't
have
tied
it
up
almost
parenthetically
with
the
statement
of
a
duty
to
act
upon
the
affidavit
instead
of
putting
it
backward
belong
--
along
with
the
procedure
requirements.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
on
occasion
--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
we
have
cited
the
experience.
the
schwinn
case
in
which
they
made
such
--
to
do
about
it
that
the
question
was
set
aside
by
the
court
as
not
being
material
because
it
was
not
required.
we've
contested
those
matters
and
for
just
that
reason.
and
that
is
--
that
is
our
reliance
in
the
matter
which
we
were
reluctant
to
give
up.
we
say
that
it
is
not
required
and
if
we
do
furnish
it
and
get
to
be
a
virtual
third
go
around
on
the
facts,
well
that's
something
that
was
certainly
not
spelled
out
by
the
congress
here.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
did
not
hear
the
beginning
of
this,
question,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
i
have
found
the
contrary,
a
memorandum
as
far
back,
it's
1943
in
which
the
matter
was
carefully
gone
over
and
analyzed,
on
the
authority
of
the
schwinn
case.
and
the
--
and
largely
because
the
only
authorities
were
already
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
the
past
when
this
1952
act
(inaudible)
begin
said
that
they
did
not
have
to
file.
it
was
their
analysis
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
suspected
this
instruction
went
out
that
the
affidavit
was
not
required.
the
u.s.
attorneys
could
file
it
when
they
felt
it
would
prevent
too
much
of
a
go
around
on
discovery
and
depositions
but
they
did
not
have
to
do
so
and
should
not
do
so
if
(voice

--
mr.
j.f.
bishop
1943.
mr.
j.f.
bishop
if
i
can
find
that.
