mr.
bishop,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what's
been
--
what
has
been
the
administrative
interpretation
of
this
affidavit
portion
of
the
act,
back
to
the
beginning.
let's
take
it
back
in
1906
when
the
act
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
thinking
of
that,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
informal
style?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
say
then
--
would
you
say
then
that
this
so-called
opinion
did
not
represent
the
opinion
of
the
department
in
1907?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
that
start?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
any
of
the
circuits
follow
the
reasoning
of
this
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
1906?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
cases
in
the
eighth
circuit
then,
the
district
of
columbia?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
this
case
you
mean
this
particular
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
reason
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
reason
why
an
affidavit
was
not
filed
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
particular
reason
why
an
affidavit
was
not
filed
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
shouldn't
it
be
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
good
is
an
affidavit
if
it
doesn't
demonstrate
any
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
congress
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
congress
didn't
say
it
was
a
--
should
be
a
third
go
around,
it
said
it
should
be
the
first
go
around.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
the
--
is
the
time
of
the
personnel
to
be
compared
with
the
procedural
right
of
the
person
who's
about
to
lose
his
citizenship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
thousands,
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
bishop?
do
you
know
how
many
denaturalization
proceedings
there
were
in
the
country
on
the
average
each
year
up
to
i'll
say
the
last
few
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
find
that
for
us
and
let
us
tomorrow
morning,
i
have
to
--
be
interesting
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
it.
mr.
judd,
we
won't
ask
you
to
start
now,
the
time
is
up.

zucca,
mr.
judd.
chief

prior
--
prior
to
the
1907.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bishop,
if
i
--
if
i
might
just
take
one
--
one
moment.
the
--
the
reason
that
doesn't
impress
me
very
much
was
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
assistant
attorney
general
at
that
time
prepared
this
act
and
the
attorney
general
himself,
very
shortly
after
the
act
gave
the
opposite
construction
to
it
that
you
have
given
in
this
opinion
that
we're
discussing
the
other
day.
now,
i
suppose
you
would
have
been
familiar
with
that
legislative
history.
why
would
he
--
why
would
he
ignore
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.yes,
please.
and
then
you
may
make
your
other
point
too
because
i
took
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
it
declare
the
policy
of
the
attorney
generals'
office
from
that
time
until
at
least
1929
as
you
stated
yesterday?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you
--
i
thought
you
said
so
yesterday.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
mr.
bishop,
i
am
sure
it
was
an
inadvertentce
but
you
left
out
this
part
of
the
letter.
i
am
therefore
of
opinion
and
before
any
united
states
attorney
is
authorized
to
institute
proceedings
with
a
cancellation
of
the
naturalization
certificate.
he
should
be
furnished
with
a
proper
affidavit
on
which
the
proceedings
may
be
based.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
indeed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
indeed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
not
contend
that
if
the
--
if
the
section
requires
the
filing
of
an
affidavit,
the
verification
of
this
complaint
supplies
the
equivalent
of
that
affidavit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
you
didn't
raise
that
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
the
--
wouldn't
the
administrative
experience
show
what
you
would
be
put
to
if
you
have
to
file
this
affidavit,
you've
been
filing
those
affidavit
for
45
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
50
years,
or
on
many
occasions
and
apparently
for
25
years
if
so
or
20
years
or
so,
you
--
you
always
file
an
affidavit
as
far
as
the
record
shows
in
this
case.
now,
you
must
have
some
experience
by
this
time
that
would
indicate
to
you
what
you
would
have
to
do
on
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
you
may
respond
to
that
mr.
--
to
which
judd.
number
460.
mr.
bishop,
if
--
if
there
was
a
notice
went
up
to
the
district
attorneys
throughout
the
country,
you
will
send
us
copy
of
that,
i
assume.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
