justice
felix
frankfurter
well
there
is
no
--
no
problem
of
any
extraneous
reasons
other
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
other
than
the
compulsion
if
it
beats
us
of
a
statue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
you
leave
out
the
court
of
appeals,
they
also
went
--
have
gone
astray.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
or
they
just
--
they
just
under
the
laws
the
district
court
contended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
try
to
discourage
if
you
will.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
understand
(inaudible)
mr.
bishop.
justice

(inaudible)
united
states
as
to
why
he
could
if
he
say,
upon
an
affidavit
showing
good
cause
and
therefore,
that
--
that
affidavit
is
required
in
order
to
be
--
the
u.s.
attorney
to
begin
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
looked
forward
that
contemplates
that
somebody
making
that
affidavit
is
your
suggestion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
u.s.
attorney
(inaudible)
to
come
outside
--
without
--
come
in
and
explain
like
an
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
affidavit.
who
is
contemplated
in
making
the
affidavit
to
move
with
your
inserted
company
from
without
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
in
respect
of
what
was
said
when
the
original
inadequacy,
department
of
labor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
believe
it's
funny,
really
funny.
the
u.s.
attorney
has
to
get
an
affidavit
from
another
official
of
united
states
government
before
he
moves.
that's
funny.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
doesn't
sound
funny
that
he
should
make
an
affidavit
as
the
basis
of
core
action,
that
doesn't
sound
funny.
maybe
redundant
but
it
doesn't
--
isn't
funny.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
when
he's
pushed
from
without.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
you
know
if
another
statue,
one
other
statute
in
which
the
congress
has
indicated
that
a
lethargic
or
indifferent
or
unoccupied
u.s.
attorney
must
be
moved
into
an
action
by
violation
of
a
criminal
law
of
united
states
by
somebody
who
without
making
an
affidavit
under
this
movement
he
must
start
a
proceeding.
one
other
case
in
the
--
this
is
in
the
whole
u.s.--
in
the
u.s.
(inaudible)
i
should
be
the
private
(inaudible)
i
don't
know
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
we
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
contemplates
if
somebody
has
heard
(inaudible)
that
is
naturalization
(inaudible)
and
then
he
goes
in
and
complains
to
the
u.s.
attorney
about
it
and
the
u.s.
attorney
says,
"why
did
i
take
your
word
for
it?
you
better
make
an
affidavit."
and
that
congress
wrote
this
prerequisite
into
this
statute
as
the
basis
of
having
him
start
proceedings,
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
i
asked
you
to
produce
another
statute
in
which
the
congress
of
the
united
states
safeguarded
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
u.s.
attorney
by
requiring
some
(inaudible)
complaining
to
make
an
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
they
just
strike
this
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
so.
i
can
match
that
forward
proceeding
at
which
i
have
also
committed
to
know
because
i
have
the
rights
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
match
that
with
the
(inaudible)
proceeding
about
the
lassitude
and
indifference
and
corruption
regarding
custom
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
to
this,
i
just
wanted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
bishop
--
i
understand
your
transposition,
the
way
you
read
it
as
good
as
--
is
there
--
is
there
any
documentation
for
reading
it
that
way
other
that
the
argumentative
explanation
we'll
give?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
upon
the
affidavit
showing
good
cause
therefore,
meaning,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorney,
meaning
that
it
shall
be
his
duty
if
and
when
an
affidavit
is
submitted.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
judicial
history
when
it
was
reenacted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
--
having
it
fine,
isn't
the
question.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
--
all
i'm
saying
is
unless
the
statute
of
limitation
comes
into
play,
if
the
u.s.
attorney
files
the
complaint
without
an
affidavit
on,
what
is
the
date,
on
january
24th,
is
it?
january
24th
without
an
affidavit
assuming
just
by
(inaudible)
and
three
months
--
and
the
case
goes
on
its
present
way
and
two
months
later,
or
three
months
later,
or
x
months
later,
somebody
says
hello,
there's
no
affidavit
with
any
file,
unless
the
statute
of
limitation
is
(inaudible)
you
might
as
well
say
it's
instituted
as
of
the
moment
that
the
affidavit
was
filed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
agree
with
you
but
the
fact
that
he
didn't
start
it
two
months
ago
doesn't
mean
he
can't
start
it
two
months
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
saying
that.
i
am
saying
that
--
i
can
be
thrown
out
of
court
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
of
some
jurisdictional
defect,
and
then
repair
the
defect
by
meeting
the
jurisdictional
requirement
a
little
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
filed
--
they
started
when
the
affidavit
was
signed.
and
after
(inaudible)
look
at
the
schwinn
case
that
i've
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
understand
the
petitioner
affirmed
here
on
a
specific
ground,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
affirmative
--
this
court
restrict
it
so,
restricted
it
though
explicit
and
perceptive
to
a
specific
ground,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
it's
secret
to
you
that
this
court
may
at
times
have
differencing
of
opinion
about
if
it
says
nothing
when
it
doesn't
have
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
refer
to
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
attorney
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
administrates
for
attaining
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
cooley
was
different.
the
authority
was
appropriate
on
this
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
mr.
bishop,
may
i
ask
whether
and
affidavit
showing
good
cause
therefore,
does
that
mean
anything
more
than
a
statement,
does
that
mean
they
have
set
forth
the
evidence
with
any
particularity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
care
what
the
respondent
asks
but
i
am
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
i
don't
--
assuming
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
the
lower
court
decision
is
correct,
what
is
called
for
in
the
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
administration
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
that
all
in
the
court,
is
all
i
read
about
the
great
modern
(inaudible)or
judicial
proceeding,
pretrial,
all
the
cards
on
the
table
and
all
the
rest
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
what
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
difficulty
about
putting
this
in
an
affidavit?
i
don't
follow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
that
a
u.s.
attorney
before
he
begins
a
proceeding
whether
criminal
justice,
whether
prosecution
or
denaturalization
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proceedings
of
great
weight
and
deep
consequences
to
individuals
involved
as
a
case
pretty
well
in
hand.
i'll
make
that
assumption
about
a
u.s.
attorney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
not
--
should
i
not
make
such
an
assumption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
witnesses
but
this
is
--
the
u.s.
attorney
can
make
an
affidavit
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
but
when
it
comes
to
the
actual
trial
subject
to
the
all
rules
of
evidence,
this
is
the
case
we're
going
to
establish.
can't
i
make
that
assumption,
i
should
think
i
ought
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
what
is
the
difficulty
of
an
affidavit
to
that
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
(inaudible)
if
our
proceeding,
judicial
proceedings
generally
for
one
reason
or
another
on
many
weren't
so
laggard,
do
you
think
it
would
be
disposed
of
as
they
are
in
english
courts
very
quickly?so
what
is
the
--
what
is
there
about
having
the
cards
up
your
sleeves,
i
don't
follow
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you've
said
that
this
--
this
furnishing
of
affidavit
towards
laxity,
slipped
into
by
the
u.s.
attorney,
the
attorney
general,
attorney
general
bonaparte
who's
a
very
charming
and
easy-going
man
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
this
follow
until
--
for
years,
they've
--
they
acted
on
his
opinions.
do
i
infer
that
they
were
disclosed
a
great
(inaudible)
of
legal
proceeding
as
a
result
of
the
practice,
the
right
to
your
wrong
pursuit
according
to
your
views
(inaudible)
was
there
any
--
is
there
any
experience
to
show
that
that
really
bog
down
denaturalization
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
my
--
that
isn't
my
--
it
is
clear
into
your
argument,
so
that
in
part
your
argument
was
--
is
that
this
is
an
undue
retardation,
undue
delay,
it's
a
nuisance
without
corresponding
benefits
required
of
special
argument
to
try
on
factual
grounds,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
call
it
a
third
round
then,
that's
a
shorter
phrase.
it's
a
better
english
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'd
follow
your
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
that
score.
i
understand
that.
but
you
mean
the
suggestion
from
the
bench
with
some
show
of
sympathy
toward
the
requirement,
i
say
it
would
add
a
needless
what
you
call
a
third
round,
it
would
--
it
would
needlessly
harbor
proceedings,
isn't
that
--
wasn't
that
one
of
your
contentions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
i
asked
--
therefore
i
asked
whether
during
the
years
when
gratuitous
and
without
the
requirement
of
law,
affidavits
were
filed
but
the
experience
show
that
they
did
harbor
these
proceedings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happened?
just
tell
us
the
great
consequence
that
happened
from
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
even
had
to
show
these
and
i'm
not
(inaudible)
the
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
say
that
sentence
--
could
you
say
that
sentence
what
the
legislative
history
shows
explicit
on
the
question
of
the
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
state
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
mr.
judd
that
the
correction
that
i
should
suppose
if
congress
in
passing
the
statute
for
denaturalization
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
enforcement
authority
that
the
attorney
general
could
entrust
any
u.s.
attorney
to
make
appropriate
action,
isn't
that
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
you
didn't
have,
that
would
have
a
general
implication
in
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
enforce
that
act
of
congress
to
be
the
appropriate
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
is,
that
congress
does
seem
fit
to
make
one
comprehensive
of
the
exclusive
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
indicated
that
the
--
this
general
thing
that's
relied
on
--
the
general
power
to
enforce
the
laws
wouldn't
carry
today?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
the
government
doesn't
contest
--
the
government
doesn't
contend
if
an
affidavit
would
be
necessary
to
satisfy
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
their
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
this
officially,
supposes
i
understand
the
matter,
denaturalization
apart
from
the
statute
rested
on
an
extrinsic
versus
an
intrinsic
(inaudible)
which
is
one
of
the
worst
bombs
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
congress
wanted
to
do
several
things
at
the
same
time
and
though
use
--
and
having
(inaudible)
to
emphasize
one
thing
rather
than
the
other.
there
was
in
the
disclosure
which
was
sufficient
to
occur
of
wholesale
fraudulent
naturalization
so
that
political
(inaudible)
could
vote
those
who
may
does
have
to
be
enfranchised.
and
up
to
that
time,
the
means
of
undoing
that
by
order
after
the
proceeding
would
put
(inaudible)
not
a
very
strong
reason
on
this
case
to
be.
and
therefore,
they
would
pass
this
statute
to
provide
explicit
proceeding
or
--
for
court
proceedings
to
honor
the
--
or
solicitously
or
fraudulently
obtain
naturalization
and
at
the
same
time,
it's
put
into
protected
speeches
so
the
listing
wouldn't
be
done
fruitless.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
of
this
is
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
judd,
i
don't
see
why
you
don't
like
the
short
answer
but
that
question
is
not
here.
the
government
brought
one
question
here,
namely,
whether
an
affidavit
if
inquired,
not
on
this
affidavit,
this
document
satisfies
the
requirement
of
an
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
we
hope
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
a
(inaudible)
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
about
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
would
often
like
to
have
as
(inaudible)
the
word
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it
was
--
it
was
doing
dicta,
attorney
general
jackson
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
where
are
the
district
court
decisions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
haven't
had
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
pleading
the
opinions
or
just
dispositions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
cited
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
what
about
the
--
did
they
know
about
the
(inaudible)
of
these
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
other
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
how
the
weigh
authority
(inaudible)
the
weight
scale
the
weight.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
judges
or
even
the
district
court
opinion
are
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
--
as
to
each
of
the
unit
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
it
be
--
why
should
it
be
of
his
own
knowledge?
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
there
are
thousands
of
cases
are
brought
everyday
in
the
city
of
new
york,
are
information
and
belief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
yes,
but
i
don't
see
why
the
u.s.
attorney
doesn't
--
can't
set
forth
the
basis
on
which
he
takes
action
everyday,
as
i
understand
his
job.
everyday
he
makes
his
action
on
information
that
comes
through
the
appropriate
government
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
all
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
must
be
by
the
u.s.
attorney.
i'm
suggesting
that
an
affidavit
on
the
basis
of
which
the
u.s.
attorney
acts
whether
he
makes
the
affidavit
or
whether
he
offends
the
affidavit
or
somebody
in
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
and
says,
on
this
basis
i'm
bringing
this
suit
with
the
matter
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
a
different
story.
that's
another
story.
everyday
in
the
city
of
new
york,
affidavits
are
challenged
as
inadequate.
i
think
what
we're
here
discussing
whether
this
--
what
the
scope
of
the
affidavits
are.
that
would
be
based
on
specific
circumstances
of
a
particular
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
maybe
the
reason
i
haven't
made
myself
clear
is
because
i
haven't
given
great
asperity
to
the
form
of
the
affidavit,
the
necessity
of
the
affidavit
is
what
i'm
primarily
concerned
mr.
justice
reed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
are
number
of
proceedings
which
require
the
filing
od
an
affidavit
in
support
of
the
remedy
sought.
it
comes
to
my
mind
either
we
had
one
or
two
(inaudible)
very
unusual
proceedings.
and
of
course
you
had
to
file
an
affidavit
giving
a
basis
of
believing.
if
you
don't
detain
the
fellow,
he
would
makeshift
and
go
to
algeria
or
wherever.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
everyday
in
the
freeport,
in
the
county
of
new
york,
there
are
hundreds
of
affidavit
trials
for
the
purpose
of
attachments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
won't
get
your
attachment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
judd
(inaudible)
by
the
colloquy
which
has
just
taken
place
satisfying
if
it
(inaudible)
the
status,
requirement
that
an
affidavit
be
filed
as
part
of
the
complaint
has
no
bearing
on
what
the
government
must
or
need
not
disclose
so
far
as
confidential
files
of
the
case.
the
--
the
requirement
of
the
affidavit
doesn't
enlarge
the
area
openness
of
its
fight,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
words,
they
don't
have
to
--
whatever--
whatever
material
in
the
possession
of
the
government
are
protected,
they'd
call
it
confidential.
at
a
trial,
would
be
protected
is
not
required,
i
mean,
by
this
--
by
the
--
the
scope
of
this
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
story.
they
can't
win
on
the
merits
ultimately
if
they
can't
make
this
to
look
as
--
ultimately
they
ought
not
to
bring
the
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
before
you
sit
down
i
ought
to
say
one
word,
as
you
all
--
we
all
repeated
the
objection,
this
was
an
informal
date
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
dashed
off.
now,
i
was
a
young
man
and
to
a
young
man
then
was,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
was
the
kind
of
an
all
(inaudible)
but
i
didn't
know
attorney
general
(inaudible)
i
had
official
relations
with
my
talk
with
them.
but
he
wasn't
an
informal
(inaudible)
in
the
sense
of
a
very
charming,
highly
refined
person,
maybe
a
young
fellow,
(inaudible).
but
i
cannot
allow
it
to
be
less,
the
impression
to
be
less
that
when
he
was
asked
by
a
cabinet
officer
a
question
that
mr.
(inaudible)
sat
down
and
dashed
off
something
without
reading
the
statute,
without
talking
to
mr.
cooling,
with
a
greater
authority
on
this
subject,
and
(inaudible)
and
that's
what
he
actually
deliberately
put
down
on
me
in
an
opinion
expressed
over
his
signature,
not
some
law
firm
or
somebody
at
the
department
of
justice
but
himself
is
inconceivable
that
he
didn't
study
the
statute,
examine
it,
consider
it.
talked
with
those
who
had
the
administration
of
it
in
charge
with
belief
and
then
wrote
this
letter
in
a
suggestion
that
it's
informal
because
it
doesn't
take
six
pages
or
it
doesn't
have
footnotes,
there's
something
that
i
cannot
(inaudible)
