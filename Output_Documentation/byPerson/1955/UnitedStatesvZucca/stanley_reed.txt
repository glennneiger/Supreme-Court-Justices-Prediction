i
didn't
understand
what
affidavit
it
was.
justice
stanley

that
was
what
--
justice
stanley
reed
that
was
filed
in
the
trial
court?
justice
stanley
reed
who
executed
this
affidavit?
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
mean
the
individual
but
was
it
the
united
states
attorney
or
was
it
someone
that
advised
him
on
it?
justice
stanley
reed
but
i
don't
understand
why
if
that
affidavit
was
there
it
was
necessary
to
consider
this
problem
at
all.
justice
stanley
reed
or
--
or
--
(voice

--
justice
stanley

it
was
filed
during
the
trial
but
that
it
--
justice
stanley
reed
all
right.
justice
stanley
reed
is
the
u.s.attorney
--
does
his
affidavit
satisfy
the
requirements
as
in
here
if
he
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
filed
an
affidavit
saying
that
he
believes
there's
good
cause
for
it.
justice
stanley

without
even
knowing

it
has
to
be
by

justice
stanley

mr.
bishop,
in
the
--
you
pointed
out
the
(inaudible)
case
here,
the
practice
of
the
party
on
that
and
that
is
that
they
followed
the
(inaudible)
case
some
years
after
that.
the
department
had
--
did
the
department
at
that
time
have
regulations
or
suggestions
that
were
issued
to
united
states
attorney
directing
him
how
to
proceed
or
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
at
--
at
the
present
time,
how
do
the
united
states
attorneys
know
not
to
--
that
is
necessary?
justice
stanley
reed
you
--
you
don't
have
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
don't
you
have
regulations
that
the
department
of
justice
for
conduct
of
the
business
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office?
justice
stanley
reed
but
the
--
justice
stanley
reed
although
you
could
particularize
or
take
care
of
that
one.
justice
stanley
reed
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
clark
it
was
that
the
affidavit
might
be
made
by
any
one
that
was
familiar
with
the
facts.
justice
stanley
reed
that
would
need
to
be
filed
with
the
--
of
what's
not
--
not
--
but
either
of
facts
from
the
examinations
such
as
the
immigration
service
as
to
the
individual
who
had
seen
in,
for
instance,
in
the
communist
party.
justice
stanley
reed
are
there
other
--
other
civil
actions
that
require
affidavits?
justice
stanley
reed
those
--
those
are
all
long
information,
belief,
like
that.
justice
stanley
reed
before
--
i'd
like
to
continue
justice
clark's
question
just
for
a
moment.
the
statute
says,
affidavit
of
good
cause,
doesn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
and
is
your
attack
then
on
this
affidavit
that
it
is
not
sufficient
in
itself?
justice
stanley
reed
that
would
be
a
mere
case
of
amendments.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
well
that
--
that
means
that
the
--
that
the
affidavit
was
--
have
to
be
made
by
a
person
familiar
with
the
facts
whether
it
was
the
united
states
attorney
which
seems
almost
inconceivable
most
of
the
case.
but
each
time
that
you
have
to
get
a
person
who
is
familiar
with
the
facts
and
was
willing
to
make
an
affidavit.
justice
stanley
reed
those
facts
of
his
own
knowledge.
justice
stanley
reed
i'm
still
unclear
about
your
position.
must
--
must
the
affidavit
be
by
a
person
who
is
familiar
with
the
fact
itself
so
to
be
competent
in
evidence
in
the
court
to
sustain
the
complaint
or
can
it
be
made
on
information
and
belief?
justice
stanley
reed
this
isn't
--
not
a
question
of
form,
this
is
a
question
of
who
furnishes
the
affidavit.
justice
stanley
reed
and
the
--
and
that
--
that
could
be
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
hear
my
own
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
problem
for
the
united
states
attorney
to
comply
with
this
or
whether
it's
--
and
that
would
have
weight
on
the
interpretation
that
one
might
place
upon
the
statute
as
to
what
could
be
done.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
that's
sufficient,
that's
--
that's
the
question
of
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
of
whether
good
cause
of
action
is
stated.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
noticed
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
the
lower
--
the
lower
court
and
that's
the
only
court
that
wrote
on
it
really.
they
say
that
the
united
states
attorney
must
be
furnished
with
an
affidavit
on
page
14
of
your
record.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that
--
that's
the
holding
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
this
particular
affidavit
here
was
invalid.
that's
the
way
they
approached
it,
it
seems
to
me.
if
it
--
it's
bad
as
a
significant
statement.
we
must
be
furnished
with
an
affidavit.
