mr.
orrin
g.
judd
all
right.
(inaudible)
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
want
to
address
myself
to
four
phases
of
the
case
and
presenting
it
to
you
this
morning.
first,
the
language
of
the
statute,
second,
its
legislative
history,
third,
its
judicial
and
administrative
construction,
and
fourth,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
reasonable
protection
of
naturalized
citizens.
i
believe
all
these
considerations
will
support
the
construction
adopted
by
the
courts
below
with
an
affidavit
showing
good
cause
is
a
necessary
part
of
a
complaint
for
denaturalization
of
a
naturalized
citizen.
i
just
want
to
point
out
in
the
beginning,
this
--
what
the
court
well
knows
that
this
is
a
serious
matter
for
a
defendant
jeopardizing
his
hard
won
citizenship,
the
treasure
which
is
the
most
precious
thing
that
he
possessed.
the
language
of
the
act
of
1906
recognizes
this
in
setting
forth
the
procedure
for
denaturalization.
we
consider
the
affidavit
to
be
one
of
three
procedural
requirements,
all
set
forth
in
the
same
section
and
two
of
them
in
the
same
sense.
i
have
quoted
on
page
4
of
our
brief
the
1906
statute
because
the
parties,
i
think
both
agree
that
no
change
in
language
from
the
1906
statute
has
been
intended
to
make
any
change
in
construction.
the
1906
statute
provides,
"that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
united
states
attorneys
for
the
respective
districts
upon
affidavit
showing
good
cause
therefore.
to
institute
proceedings
in
any
court
having
jurisdiction
of
naturalized
aliens
in
the
judicial
district
in
which
the
naturalized
citizen
may
reside
at
the
time
of
bringing
suit."
the
second
sentence
of
that
same
paragraph
provides,
"that
any
such
proceedings,
the
party
holding
the
certificate
of
citizenship
alleged
to
have
been
fraudulently
or
illegally
procured
shall
have
60
days
personal
notice
in
which
to
make
an
answer
to
the
petition
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
there
are
three
requirements
in
that
statute
that
the
proceeding
be
upon
affidavit
that
it
be
brought
in
the
district
of
the
defendant's
residence
and
that
it
be
brought
on
60
days
notice
to
the
defendant
instead
of
the
20
days
which
are
usually
given
to
answer
a
complaint.
the
government
says
that
the
first
of
those
three
requirements,
the
requirement
of
an
affidavit
is
not
a
condition
on
the
bringing
of
the
action
because
the
united
states
attorney
has
authority
to
bring
actions
from
his
general
powers.
that
meets
with
several
difficulties
it
seems
to
me
in
the
first
place.
the
government
is
quite
vague
as
to
where
that
general
power
comes
from.
there
is
no
other
statute
referred
to
which
specifically
gives
the
united
states
attorney
power
to
bring
actions.
there
is
a
statute
which
confers
the
duty
on
the
united
states
attorney
to
prosecute
all
civil
actions
in
which
the
united
states
is
concern.
that
statute
has
been
on
the
books
since
before
1906
and
the
duty
of
the
district
attorney
to
bring
an
action
as
such
stands
from
that
statute.
the
provisions,
the
procedure
for
the
actions
stems
from
the
section
340
(a).
if
as
the
government
argues,
there
are
two
types
of
action
for
the
district
attorney,
one,
where
he's
compelled
by
an
outsider
affidavit
to
bring
the
action
and
another
when
he
brings
it
under
a
general
power
without
an
affidavit,
then
it's
--
requires
a
strange
construction
of
the
statute
to
say
that
the
other
procedural
requirements
apply
to
an
action
brought
under
the
general
power.
if
the
u.s.
attorney
under
some
general
power
can
bring
an
action
without
an
affidavit,
where
is
the
statute
that
says,
"such
an
action
must
be
brought
in
the
district
of
the
defendant's
residence?"
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
suppose
that's
so.
but
here
the
statute
directs
that
it
be
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
and
the
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
yes,
but
if
the
--
if
the
enforcement
is
on
the
general
power
and
not
under
this
statute,
my
point
is,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
then,
it
is
not
clear
that
the
protective
requirements
of
venue
and
notice
would
be
imported
into
that
general
action.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
what
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right.
this
was
supposedly
the
one
procedure
and
that's
what
we
believe
was
held
in
the
bindczyck
case
that
i'll
come
to
in
a
few
minutes.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
think
the
u.s.
attorney
mr.
justice
clark
must
file
the
affidavit
with
the
court.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
there
are
two
things
that
matter
with
this
affidavit.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
an
affidavit
which
sets
forth
the
sort
of
facts
that
we
believe
are
required
in
an
affidavit
showing
good
cause.
in
the
second
place,
it
is
not
an
affidavit
by
someone
who
has
knowledge
or
can
state
where
he
gets
that
knowledge
of
the
facts.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
think
there
was
an
inadvertence
and
they
the
intended
the
whole
thing
to
be
on
information
and
belief.
if
you
will
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well
not
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
one
of
the
things
that
we've
helped
--
i
think
an
affidavit
helps
on
is
the
determination
of
where
to
start
on
taking
depositions.
we
endeavor
to
take
the
deposition
of
mr.
mantzoros
who
had
sworn
that
the
facts
in
the
complaint
are
true
and
on
page
8
of
the
record
is
his
affidavit
in
response
to
that
motion,
in
which
he
recites
that
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
any
of
the
facts,
is
not
a
prospective
witness,
that
all
the
information
that
he
has
is
from
files
in
the
case
which
were
turned
over
to
him
and
that
many
of
those
file
are
privileged
because
of
their
confidential
nature.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
it
depends
on
the
--
on
the
nature
of
the
case.
but
he
would
be
able
from
the
files
in
his
possession
to
set
forth
the
sort
of
facts
rather
than
conclusions
which
would
enable
us
to
know
what
we
were
charged
with
and
to
answer
the
complaint
without
the
involved
depositions
that
the
government
says
are
the
alternative
to
this
affidavit
of
good
cause.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right.
the
--
the
argument
in
the
minker
case
before
this
court,
certainly
the
briefs
in
the
minker
case
which
we
read
pointed
out
that
as
a
routine
matter
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
makes
a
careful
investigation
before
it
turns
the
matter
over
to
the
united
states
attorney.
and
we
don't
know
from
this
complaint
whether
it
came
from
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
or
where
it
came
from.
if
it
did,
they
should
be
material
from
which
an
affidavit
can
be
filed
in
order
to
comply
with
the
statute
if
that's
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
they
--
they
did
not
so
contend
on
the
argument
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
the
--
the
language
of
the
statute
when
it
says,
"upon
affidavit
showing
good
cause
therefore,
is
wording
which
has
a
natural
meaning
to
lawyers."
we
say
we're
going
to
bring
a
motion
upon
affidavit.
the
affidavit
is
something
which
we
present
to
the
court
with
the
motion.
the
provision
for
a
court
being
moved
to
act
upon
a
showing
of
good
cause,
it's
something
that
appears
in
many
statutes.
it's
common
lawyer's
language.
i
think
the
judge
was
correct
in
saying
that
when
the
statute
provides
for
institution
of
an
action
upon
such
an
affidavit,
it
contemplates
that
the
affidavit
be
filed.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
clark,
he
gave
them
--
in
his
opinion,
i
think,
he
said
15
days.
in
his
order,
we
extended
the
time
to
60
days.
the
government
decided
that
they
wanted
to
test
the
necessity
of
the
affidavit
so
they
didn't
utilize
the
60
days.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
don't
believe
it
would
have,
mr.
justice
clark,
not
in
this
case.
i'm
getting
a
little
ahead
of
myself,
but
one
of
the
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
one
of
the
problems
we
have
in
this
case
is
the
generality
of
the
conclusions
that
i
set
forth,
paragraph
7
on
page
3
of
the
record
recites,
"that
said
defendant
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
including
the
workers'
communist
party
and
other
organizations
affiliated
with
or
controlled
by
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
from
1925
to
1947."
i
don't
think
i
have
to
tell
this
court
how
many
organizations
there
are
which
may
have
been
alleged
to
have
been
affiliated
with
or
controlled
by
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
over
that
period
of
22
years.
i
would
suppose
that
an
affidavit
which
did
not
set
forth
from
the
immigration
department's
files,
if
this
is
an
immigration
department
complaint,
the
names
of
those
organizations
so
that
we
can
ascertain
where
to
look
in
going
back
through
our
planet's
past
history
to
answer
the
complaint.
i
would
suppose
that
such
an
affidavit
did
not
comply
with
what
congress
intends
in
setting
forth
good
cause
for
the
complaint.
or
a
complaint,
this
isn't
adequate
under
the
--
under
the
new
rules.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
the
--
we
had
a
motion
to
particularized,
mr.
justice
reed.
we
brought
an
omnibus
motion
for
dismissal
for
vagueness,
a
dismissal
for
lack
of
an
affidavit
and
for
particulars.
the
judge
did
not
deny
our
motion
for
particulars.
he
held
that
in
advance
because
if
the
motion
--
if
the
complaint
was
dismissed,
there
was
no
need
to
decide
it
and
if
the
government
had
filed
the
affidavit
it
might
have
supplied
the
particulars
and
he
might
not
had
decided
that
motion.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
don't
know
that
i'd
go
as
far
as
that,
mr.
justice
reed.
we
haven't
tried
the
brief
at
this
stage,
what
is
a
satisfactory
affidavit.
we
think
that
there
are
some
things
which
might
be
showing
that
information
and
belief.
but
i
would
think
when
it
comes
to
a
serious
charge
like
membership
in
the
party,
they
should
be
someone
who
has
seen
this
card
or
who
could
testify
to
what
overt
act
show
they
joined
the
party.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
think
that's
--
that's
right,
mr.
justice
clark.
i
think
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
as
i
see
it,
that's
the
difference
between
a
pleading
and
an
affidavit.
the
pleading
may
set
forth
conclusions,
when
congress
asks
for
an
affidavit
it
asks
for
something
which
sets
forth
facts
in
some
detail.
now,
we
told
that
the
court
bypassed
this
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
language.
i
find
that
the
court
quoted
the
language
of
the
statute
three
times
on
pages
12
and
13
of
the
record
in
the
course
its
opinion.
and
it
used
some
of
this
reasoning
that
i
have
used
on
page
14
of
the
opinion
where
it
said,
"the
fact
that
congress
inserted
these
protections
referring
to
venue
and
the
notice,
the
fact
that
congress
inserted
these
requirements
for
the
protection
of
naturalized
citizens
in
the
1906
act
has
been
consistent
with
the
government's
position."
and
there's
a
--
the
reason
the
court
went
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
like
to
pass
to
now
is
because
there
had
been
a
spate
of
cases
in
1953
and
1954
which
held
the
affidavit
is
not
jurisdictional,
is
not
necessary
and
need
not
be
filed.
then
the
court
naturally
wanted
to
be
sure
and
we
wanted
to
give
the
court
adequate
information
when
we
were
briefed
here
that
in
following
the
cases
from
the
appellate
court
of
this
--
appeals
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
third
and
fifth
circuit
instead
of
the
dictum
in
the
schwinn
case
and
the
later
district
court
cases,
he
was
right.
the
legislative
history,
it
seems
to
me
confirms
what
the
court
said.
first,
we
ought
to
consider
what
the
situation
was
in
1906
when
the
statute
was
passed.
it's
true
that
some
actions
for
denaturalization
were
being
brought
at
that
time
but
the
power
to
bring
them
was
uncertain.
there
had
been
cases
in
the
federal
court
which
is
cited
at
page
28
of
our
brief
where
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
prior
to
the
1906
statute,
mr.
justice
warren.
one
case
held
that
a
federal
court
could
not
offset
a
decree
of
naturalization
granted
in
the
state
court
for
procedural
irregularities
in
that
court
since
there
were
questions
about
the
actions
of
state
courts.
the
united
states
attorney
naturally
preferred
to
proceed
in
the
federal
court.
another
case,
which
was
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
even
the
federal
court
dealing
with
a
federal
judgment
could
not
offset
it
for
extra
defraud
where
the
judgment
was
regular
on
its
face
and
the
proceeding
was
an
independent
proceeding.
somehow
in
spite
of
those
cases,
some
courts
were
--
prevailed
upon
the
grant
orders
denaturalizing
aliens.
but
the
administration
recognized
the
necessity
for
legislation
which
would
be
sure
and
effective
and
safeguarding.
and
we
cited
further
in
our
brief,
presidential
messages
from
1874
on
which
called
for
the
enactment
of
specific
denaturalization
legislation.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
no,
i
could
--
one
of
the
worst
was
all
right,
your
honor.
there
are
probably
several
others.
but
when
you
come
to
the
legislative
history
and
we
look
at
the
first
statute
that
was
--
the
first
draft
of
the
bill
which
is
set
forth
on
page
29
of
our
brief.
the
original
bill
as
proposed
by
the
commission
on
naturalization
on
which
the
attorney
general
was
represented
simply
said,
"the
united
states
shall
have
the
power
to
institute
proceedings
with
the
purpose
of
setting
aside
the
certificate
of
citizenship.?
that
was
to
clarify
the
doubts
which
existed
before
to
whether
such
an
action
could
be
properly
be
brought.
the
committee
on
immigration
and
naturalization
in
the
house
revised
that
and
inserted
the
requirement
of
an
affidavit
so
that
the
draft
read,
"the
united
states
shall
upon
affidavit
made
by
any
credible
person
have
the
power
to
institute
proceedings.?
now,
it's
significant
that
the
word
"credible
person"
there
was
comparable
for
the
words
"credible
witness"
in
the
naturalization
sections
that
congress
felt
there
was
need
for
just
as
great
particularity
and
protection
in
revoking
naturalization
as
in
naturalizing.
the
requirement
of
an
affidavit
as
it
was
set
forth
in
this
first
statute,
or
in
this
draft
submitted
by
the
committee
was
clearly
a
qualification,
a
condition
on
the
existence
of
the
power.
the
requirement
of
an
affidavit
didn't
come
in
with
the
language
of
duty.
the
reference
to
duty
came
in
at
later
stage,
referred
to
on
page
32
of
our
brief,
at
the
same
time
as
the
provision
concerning
venue.
it
was
proposed
by
congressman
bonin
who
was
the
floor
manager
of
the
bill
and
the
chairman
of
a
subcommittee,
having
to
do
with
these
sections
of
the
bill.
at
that
time
the
word
"power"
was
changed
to
"duty",
a
restriction
to
the
venue
in
the
district
of
residence
living
out
the
district
where
the
citizen
was
naturalized,
was
introduced
and
the
word
"affidavit"
made
by
any
credible
person
was
changed
to
affidavit
showing
good
cause.
it
seems
to
us
hardly
likely
that
what
was
in
the
preceding
draft
a
tradition
on
the
exercise
of
the
power
was
changed
to
a
mere
option
or
means
of
compulsion
by
this
amendment
particularly,
when
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
amendment
was
to
create
additional
protection
for
the
defendant
by
providing
limitations
on
the
venue.
the
--
now,
there's
no
statement
in
congress
to
indicate
such
a
change.
we've
been
through
the
legislative
debates.
they're
analyzed
in
our
brief
so
that
i
can
fairly
say
that
there
is
no
implicate
--
no
indication
there
that
a
changed
from
a
conditional
power
to
a
mere
means
of
compulsion
of
the
district
attorney
was
explained
to
congress
as
being
involved
in
this
amendment
which
congressman
bonin
proposed.
we're
told
by
the
government
that
the
district
attorneys
were
so
lax
that
it
was
necessary
to
impose
that
duty
on
them.
i'm
sorry
to
disagree
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
congressional
record
but
i'm
sure
that
your
honors
will
want
to
analyze
it
for
yourselves.
but
i
have
found
no
complaints
of
laxity
on
the
part
of
united
states
attorneys
in
the
record.
there
are
complaints
by
various
congressmen
about
the
state
attorneys.
there
are
suggestions
that
united
states
attorneys
maybe
overzealous
in
taking
appeals
in
naturalization
cases
in
order
to
prevent
people
from
voting.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
any
united
states
attorney
who
has
been
presented
with
the
case
by
the
naturalization
service
or
from
any
other
source
had
unreasonably
refused
to
proceed.
on
the
contrary,
there
were
instances
in
the
published
reports
of
overzealous
action
on
the
part
of
unites
states
attorneys.
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
believing
that
the
state
courts
in
1868
had
granted
certificates
of
citizenship
without
proper
formality
issued
a
warning
to
all
citizens
who
carried
1868
certificates
of
naturalization
to
bring
them
in
and
not
to
vote
for
fear
they
might
be
prosecuted
and
sent
to
jail.
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
the
protection
of
naturalized
citizens
and
not
the
necessity
or
giving
a
club
over
united
states
attorneys.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
yes.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
i
think
as
you
read
the
congressional
hearings
you'll
find
that
there
was
a
constant
expression
of
concern
not
to
make
naturalization
too
hard
or
not
to
make
denaturalization
too
easy.
in
fact,
some
of
the
changes
that
were
made
were
to
relax
the
educational
requirements.
so
that
the
--
it
was
sufficient
if
a
person
could
speak
english
without
being
able
to
read
it
for
instance.
we're
told
that
there
were
five
bills
which
constituted
the
basis
for
compromise
and
required
the
insertion
of
a
provision
exercising
compulsion
over
united
states
attorney.
actually,
if
you
look
at
the
government's
brief,
it
appears
that
there
were
three
bills
plus
two
antecedents
of
those
bills
in
earlier
congresses.
those
bills
did
a
number
of
things
in
addition
to
providing
that
action
might
be
brought
either
by
the
united
states
attorney
or
by
a
private
citizen.
the
committee
reported
not
on
those
specific
bills
but
the
committee
stated
that
if
it
considered
all
the
bills
which
have
been
introduced
in
congress
before
it
introduced
its
measure.
and
its
measure
contained
the
language
that
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
point.
the
united
states
shall,
upon
affidavit
made
by
any
credible
person
have
the
power
to
institute
proceedings.
in
other
words,
the
committee
after
considering
these
bills
rejected
the
idea
and
decided
that
what
was
necessary
was
an
affidavit
of
the
condition
of
bringing
the
action.
and
there's
no
request
in
the
debate
in
between
the
time
when
the
committee
bill
was
introduced
and
the
time
when
they
--
duty
--
the
word
of
duty
came
in
with
the
venue
restriction
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
change
in
purpose.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
yes,
i
think
we
can
--
there
are
numbers
of
instances
in
which
an
affidavit
is
necessary.
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
is
required
in
connection
with
a
search
warrant,
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
is
required
or
an
affidavit
of
merit
is
required
under
our
rules,
under
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
connection
with
reopening
a
judgment.
in
fact,
prior
to
1906
when
one
of
the
methods
of
reopening
a
naturalization
decree
was
a
bill
of
review,
affidavits
were
part
of
the
papers
on
which
that
bill
of
review
had
to
be
based.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
can
tell
you
of
that
mr.
justice
clark.
there
are
of
course
in
the
rules
of
the
various
administrative
agencies
requirements
for
showing
good
cause
where
an
extension
of
time
is
granted
or
where
a
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
if
they're
on
information
and
belief,
it's
necessary
to
state
the
source
of
the
information
and
belief.
and
i
don't
think
simply
saying
that
it's
from
general
files
without
saying
what
particular
sort
of
information
in
those
files
gives
it
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
no,
i
don't
mean
the
page
in
the
files,
i
mean,
the
fact
that
he
had
belonged
to
the
--
contributed
to
the
international
labor
defense
if
that
is
construed
as
being
a
member
of
an
organization
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
or
explained
that
he
was
a
secretary
of
a
committee
which
was
organized
for
some
subversive
purpose.
i
would
think
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
no,
it
says
he
was
a
communist
and
these
various
other
things.
now,
we
believe
--
we
believe
that
we
can
defeat
the
case
on
the
communist
charge.
we
don't
know
what
the
other
charges
are.
those
are
the
ones
that
seem
to
us
important
to
be
informed
about
it.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
if
that
were
true,
it
would
make
--
it
would
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that
allegation
is
true
and
i
think
it
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
in
the
complaint.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
because
i
think
he
should
show
when
he's
showing
a
good
cause
--
that
he
could
show
good
cause
to
believe
that
those
affidavit
--
that
those
statements
were
true.
his
affidavit
of
verification
was
certainly
qualified
by
a
subsequent
affidavit
where
we
said,
i
know
nothing
except
what
was
in
some
files
that
were
turned
over
to
me,
much
of
which
is
privileged
than
confidential.
and
the
complaint
could
be
sustained
mr.
justice
clark,
by
dropping
out
completely
the
proof
of
it
being
a
communist
and
asserting
that
he
was
a
member
of
some
organization
affiliated
with
the
communist
party
on
the
--
because
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
he
fraudulently
concealed
the
fact
that
he
didn't
belong
to
any
organizations
except
those
which
were
recited
in
the
questionnaire
at
the
time
of
his
naturalization.
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
it
seems
to
me
if
the
complaint
is
to
go
that
far
should
set
forth
cause
for
all
the
allegations
on
which
denaturalization
is
sought
and
which
we'll
have
to
meet
at
the
trial.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
we
have
to
answer
all
the
causes.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
that's
a
--
that's
a
matter
of
draftsmanship
i
think
commonly,
the
singular
isn't
--
deemed
to
include
the
plural,
if
there
are
two
causes
in
the
complaint,
i
would
think
the
two
causes
should
be
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
without
an
affidavit,
i
would
not
say
so.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
i
think
it
would
be
--
how
much
more
is
this
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
how
much
more
detail
we
might
want
when
we
see
the
affidavit,
i
don't
want
to
commit
myself
to
at
this
time.
but
that's
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
now,
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
the
question
of
judicial
and
administrative
construction
of
this
statute
because
that
is
always
persuasive.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
yes.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
but
we
have
never
contemplated
that
the
verification
was
an
affidavit
of
good
cause.
and
the
government
hasn't
asserted
that
it
satisfies
the
statute
by
verifying
the
complaint.
if
that
issue
were
in
the
case,
i
would
say
that
the
affidavit
is
not
sufficient
because
it
doesn't
set
forth
facts.
and
it
is
not
as
broad
as
the
complaint.
and
if
the
affidavit
in
the
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
will
be
a
case
of
supplementing
the
complaints
by
an
affidavit
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
they
could
--
they
--
we
didn't
quarrel
with
the
judges'
statement
that
the
government
could
reinstate
the
complaint
by
filing
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
within
the
time
it
was
--
that
the
court
allowed.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
we
didn't
say
it
was
essential
to
reach
that
point
because
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
--
it
hadn't
been
briefed
here.
now,
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
the
statute,
we
have
first
the
attorney
general's
opinion
which
we've
referred
to
in
the
argument
yesterday
which
was
given
by
the
attorney
general
within
a
year
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute
to
the
department
that
was
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
it's
contemporaneous,
it's
official,
it's
clear.
it
says
in
so
many
words
that
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
"i
am
therefore
of
opinion
that
before
any
united
states
attorney
is
authorized
to
institute
proceedings
for
the
cancellation
of
a
naturalization
certificate,
he
should
be
furnished
with
the
proper
affidavit
on
which
the
proceedings
may
be
based.
on
which
they
may
be
based,
it
seems
to
me
implies
that
the
affidavit
is
to
be
filed
as
a
basis
for
the
proceeding.
that's
what
was
held
in
the
first
reported
case,
the
collins
case
in
the
appellate
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
so
a
demurrer
to
a
complaint
which
was
submitted
without
an
affidavit
was
valid.
the
demurrer
was
overruled,
no
evidence
put
in,
the
citizen
denaturalized,
in
that
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
set
that
demurrer
was
proper
and
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
subsequent
decisions
were
handed
down
in
the
fifth
circuit
or
in
the
third
circuit
mostly
in
cases
where
there
were
affidavits
which
were
attacked
because
insufficient
because
the
causes
that
was
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
didn't
show
fraud
or
illegality.
it
was
held
there
the
affidavit
was
necessary.
there's
a
similar
implication
in
an
eighth
circuit
opinion,
the
(inaudible)
that
we
cited
in
our
brief.
this
court
in
the
johannessen
case,
i
believe,
may
have
had
this
in
mind,
there
--
in
upholding
the
act
--
1906
act
as
applied
to
certificates
issued
before
the
date.
instead
of
the
act,
it
merely
provides
that
on
good
cause
shown
the
question
where
the
one
who
claims
the
privilege
of
citizenship
under
the
certificate
of
court
has
procured
that
through
fraud
shall
be
examined
and
determined.
it
wasn't
the
square
holding
but
certainly
this
language
that
leans
our
way,
everything
was
to
that
effect
except
the
couple
of
district
court
decisions
in
the
ninth
circuit
until
the
schwinn
case.
the
schwinn
case,
your
honors,
i
think
has
been
widely
misinterpreted
because
it's
hard
to
believe
how
narrow
the
issue
was.
in
the
schwinn
case,
we've
analyzed
the
record
on
appeal
in
the
clerk's
office
here
overnight.
in
the
schwinn
case,
there
was
a
statement
in
the
original
complaint
when
it
was
filed.
so
this
effect,
the
plaintiff's
information
and
belief
stated
herein
are
based
upon
an
affidavit
of
robert
m.
charles
and
a
trainee
for
the
immigration
of
naturalization
service
united
states
department
of
labor
a
copy
of
said
affidavit
is
attached
hereto
marked
exhibit
a.
the
issue
in
the
schwinn
case
was
whether
the
defendant
should
be
denaturalized
because
the
two
witnesses
who
would
sworn
to
his
good
character
over
a
period
of
five
years
had
known
him
for
only
four-and-a-half
years.
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
mainly
on
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
set
forth
that
it
was
true.
they'd
known
him
only
four-and-a-half
years
but
that
he
believes
that
the
dates
were
different.
he
didn't'
understand
that
it
was
only
four-and-a-half
years
and
if
he
known
at
the
time
he
could
have
produced
other
the
witnesses
whose
names
he
gave
to
the
court
and
would
have
said
he's
been
there
five
years.
the
district
court
said,
"we
can't
take
that
story.
you
didn't
have
the
five-year
residence
proof
would
be
naturalized.
and
he
found
all
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
to
be
true.
on
appeal,
the
parties
stipulated
not
to
print
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
but
the
appellant
asserted
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
finding
of
the
court
of
the
truth
of
the
allegation
and
the
complaint
that
there
was
an
affidavit
of
good
cause.
i
would
have
thought
that
that
was
a
pretty
narrow
issue
to
take
to
the
court
that
when
an
affidavit
is
filed
with
the
complaint
there
is
an
affidavit
and
all
that
the
schwinn
case
holds
and
saying
that
you
don't
have
to
put
in
additional
proof
of
the
affidavit,
all
that
it
holds
is
that
the
facts
that
are
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
may
be
proved
at
the
trial
by
someone
else
than
the
affiant.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
oh,
this
language
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
which
we
consider
dictum
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
--
which
says
it's
not
jurisdictional.
i
think
we'd
win
here
even
if
it's
not
jurisdictional.
there
can
be
jurisdiction
over
the
person
but
an
inadequate
complaint
and
the
complaint
can
be
dismissed
even
if
there's
jurisdiction.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
i
would
--
i
think
it's
a
word
that's
open
to
some
interpretation
in
this
area.
so
at
the
time
of
the
1940
reenactment
of
the
statute,
there
were
three
circuits,
four
circuit
courts
of
appeal
where
there
were
either
holdings
or
indications
that
an
affidavit
was
necessary.
one,
where
there
was
a
dictum
but
even
though
it
had
been
filed,
it
was
unnecessary.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
am
not
sure,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
then
from
1940
to
1952,
i
find
four
decisions
which
either
hold
or
lean
our
way,
and
two
that
the
--
are
contrary,
two
to
the
contrary
which
followed
schwinn,
district
court
decisions.
the
four
that
are
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
they
are
cited
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
the
schuchhardt
case
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana
and
the
favorito
case
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
they're
opinions
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
reported
opinions
citing
the
schwinn
case.
as
i
say,
i
believe
the
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
no.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
one
of
them
speaks
of
the
weight
of
authority
being
in
favor
with
schwinn.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
they're
in
the
briefs.
they
--
those
two
cases
are
cited
at
page
23.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
the
--
the
government
wanted
to
count
heads
in
court
of
appeals
and
this
weight
was
their
way,
if
you
count
all
the
cases
up
to
the
time
of
the
court
of
appeals'
argument.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
they
were
counted
the
same.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
i
don't
know
how
else
you
can
weigh
them
objectively.
then
there
was
a
hartmann
case
in
the
pennsylvania
district
court
which
is
our
way,
which
referred
to
the
affidavit
as
a
material
fact
of
the
complaint.
that's
at
page
17
of
the
brief.
then
there's
certainly
an
implication
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
schneiderman
case.
the
schneiderman
case
is
the
one
that
wendell
willkie
argued
involving
an
admitted
communist
where
this
court
held
it
was
not
sufficient
proof
that
the
communist
party
was
incepting
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
footnote
at
page
1
of
the
complaint
recited
that
an
affidavit
of
good
cause
has
been
filed
and
is
annexed
hereto
as
required
by
the
statute.
the
footnote
on
page
159
of
the
opinion
referred
to
the
complaint
--
referred
to
the
affidavit
and
says
undoubtedly,
the
affidavit
was
included
only
to
show
compliance
with
the
statute.
well,
that
isn't
the
holding
because
there
was
no
issue
about
the
necessity
of
the
complaint
but
we
believe
it
is
a
public
implication
that
such
an
affidavit
was
regarded
as
necessary.
then
came
the
bindczyck
case.
the
bindczyck
case
didn't
involve
the
necessity
of
an
affidavit
but
the
bindczyck
case
involved
our
argument
that
there
is
no
way
that
a
district
attorney
can
proceed
except
under
section
340
and
in
compliance
with
its
requirements.
in
the
bindczyck
case,
a
citizen
had
been
denaturalized
on
a
motion
made
by
the
united
states
attorney
in
a
state
court
within
the
term
seven
days
after
he
was
naturalized
on
the
ground
of
fraud.
he
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
in
the
united
states
district
courts
to
prevent
us
to
adjudge
the
validity
of
his
citizenship
and
to
prevent
deportation.
and
this
court
held
that
the
procedure
under
that
statute
in
the
state
court
was
improper
saying
and
i've
quoted
it
on
page
19
of
our
brief
and
considered
it
most
relevant
to
the
present
case.
we
cannot
escape
the
conclusion
that
in
its
detailed
provisions
for
revoking
a
naturalization
because
of
fraud
or
illegal
procurement
not
appearing
on
the
face
of
the
record,
congress
formulated
a
self-contained
exclusive
procedure.
its
procedure
was
self-contained
and
exclusive,
it
does
away
with
the
government's
argument
that
the
complaint
for
denaturalization
maybe
brought
into
some
general
power
instead
of
under
the
statute.
then
the
second
sentence
of
the
next
paragraph
is
significant.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
if
the
u.s.
attorney
has
facts
on
which
he
can
set
forth
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
facts
of
--
facts
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
but
there
the
--
where
it's
an
affidavit,
the
basis
for
the
information
and
belief
is
set
forth.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
if
we
look
at
the
--
if
we
look
at
the
practice
under
this
act
however,
justice
frankfurter,
we'll
find
that
the
affidavits
generally
filed
have
not
been
affidavits
of
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
they
--
it's
an
affidavit
of
someone
in
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
maybe
all
right
under
some
circumstances.
i
won't
look
at
the
affidavit
and
see
just
what
sort
of
grounds
he
set
forth.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
think
--
i
think
there
are
some
things
in
the
affidavit
which
may
definitely
be
on
information
and
belief.
it's
a
decision
by
judge
bourquin
some
years
ago
where
he
said,
"it's
no
defect
that
the
affidavit
is
on
information
and
belief
where
it
relates
to
things
like
the
--
whether
the
witnesses
appeared
in
open
court
which
are
easily
susceptible
of
proof.?
but
i
think
it
should
set
forth
the
names
of
witnesses,
the
dates
and
particulars
from
which
the
defendant
can
know
exactly
what
to
answer.
whether
it's
by
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
whether
it's
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
attorney
or
investigator
or
by
someone
whom
he
has
persuaded
to
execute
an
affidavit.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
argued
that
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
comply
with,
mr.
justice
reed,
because
it's
been
complied
with
so
frequently
and
regularly
in
the
past
up
to
within
the
last
few
years.
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
has
been
argued
in
various
cases
generally
not
on
the
question
whether
its
information
and
belief
but
on
the
question
whether
the
facts
that
are
set
forth
show
fraud.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
yes.
whether
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well
certainly
in
the
state
court
where
you're
getting
an
attachment,
you'd
need
an
affidavit.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
many
of
those
affidavits
are
of
on
information
and
belief
but
if
they
don't
state
the
source
of
the
information
and
belief,
they
may
be
invalid.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right.
well
the
last
part
of
the
bindczyck
opinion
that
i
wanted
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
all
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
all
i
have
to
argue
at
this
time,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
yes
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
i
think
that
may
be
part
of
the
grounds
for
his
information
and
belief.
i
don't
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
that
would
be
part
of
the
grounds
for
his
information
and
belief.
now
this
court
will
have
to
decide
this
--
will
have
to
decide
either
in
this
case
or
in
some
other
case
that
may
not
be
ours
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
--
just
what
is
necessary.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
yes.
well
that
is
the
usual
procedure,
mr.
justice
reed.
that
the
affidavit
is
furnished
by
the
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
--
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
well,
i
think
there
is
significance
to
the
statement
that
i
--
i
don't
think
the
government
and
the
district
court
asserted
that
the
verification
was
an
affidavit
complying
with
the
statute.
i
don't
think
any
affidavits
that
have
been
filed
in
most
of
the
cases
that
we've
looked
at
were
as
casual
and
general
as
the
affidavit
of
verification.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
consistent
with
what
the
court
referred
to
in
the
bindczyck
case
as
a
detailed
safeguarded
procedure
for
attacking
the
degree
of
evidence
of
fraud
outside
the
record.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
not
as
far
as
i
know,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
--
because
i
have
argued
the
case
in
all
three
courts.
the
--
some
indication
of
the
way
united
states
--
of
some
united
states
attorney
feel
about
the
matter
is
set
forth
in
the
briefs
that
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief.
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
has
not
been
filing
affidavits.
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
northern
district
in
the
barnes
case
which
this
court
reversed
last
week
along
with
minker
set
forth
the
following
as
the
reasons
why
he
told
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
that
he
needed
to
examine
the
prospective
defendant
before
the
beginning
of
the
proceeding
at
page
24
of
our
brief.
he
said
all
the
revocation
proceedings
are
instituted
by
united
states
attorneys
such
actions
must
be
based
upon
affidavit
showing
good
cause
therefore.
united
states
attorneys,
do
not
conduct
investigations
and
the
good
cause
must
be
supplied
by
some
other
agency.
this
court's
reversal
of
the
minker
case,
i
don't
think
indicates
any
opinion
that
the
affidavit
is
not
necessary.
it
simply
indicates
that
the
affidavit
can't
be
obtained
by
compulsory
testimony
of
the
defendant
in
advance
of
the
beginning
of
a
proceeding.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
construction
of
the
statute
in
the
minker
case
with
its
endeavor
to
protect
the
defendant
is
consistent
of
what
we're
arguing
here
that
this
affidavit
is
a
necessary
protection
for
the
defendant
and
we
submit
that
it's
a
reasonable
protection.
i
pointed
out
that
it's
something
that
the
government
can
supply
without
undue
difficulty.
it
does
not,
to
my
mind,
open
up
a
third
round
of
the
trial
procedure
as
mr.
bishop
has
told
us
yesterday.
if
the
affidavit
is
filed
with
the
complaint,
there'll
be
one
motion
if
this
question
about
the
affidavit.
there'll
be
a
motion
directed
to
the
complaint
and
the
affidavit
instead
of
a
motion
directed
to
complaint,
that's
the
same
motion.
we
don't
take
depositions
on
that
motion.
we
may
have
a
right
to
take
depositions
later
on
or
ask
for
interrogatories
and
the
affidavit
may
help
us
in
taking
those
interrogatories
and
asking
for
those
depositions.
and
the
60-day
time
that
were
allowed
to
answer
can
be
better
and
more
intelligently
used
if
we
have
that
affidavit
which
comes
from
files
that
the
government
presumably
already
has
before
it
brings
the
proceeding
than
if
we
have
just
a
general
complaint.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
can
i
get
the
file?
i
have
been
unable
mr.
justice
clark
even
to
get
the
record
of
the
testimony
that
was
taken
of
my
defendant
before
the
proceeding
began.
we
made
a
motion
for
depositions
and
we
were
told
we
should've
made
a
motion
for
interrogatories.
we've
made
a
motion
for
us
--
oh,
i'm
getting
outside
the
record
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
the
file.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
yes,
sir.
that's
before
the
minker
case.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that
was
before
the
minker
case
and
they
told
him
you're
coming
involuntarily
you
know,
and
he
had
counsel
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
get
the
record
of
what
he
said.
(inaudible)
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
no,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
that
was
contemplated.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
i
would
think
though
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
if
they
can't
make
the
affidavit
without
using
information
that's
confidential,
that
they
won't
be
able
to
bring
the
--
bring
the
action.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
that's
right.
mr.
orrin
g.
judd
but
i
think
the
--
the
requirement
of
the
affidavit,
mr.
justice
clark
uses
an
opportunity
to
find
out
that
fact
before
the
action
has
begun.
and
just
in
conclusion,
i
--
i
want
to
tell
the
story
of
a
little
bit
about
what
it
means,
i'm
sure
you
know
but
it
does
mean
something
terrible
for
a
defendant
to
have
a
complaint
filed
against
--
in
a
matter
of
public
record,
charging
him
with
having
concealed
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
affiliated
organizations.
it's
something
he
doesn't
like
to
tell
people
about,
that
it's
even
charged
against
him,
it
affects
his
bank
credit.
it
gives
propaganda
for
people
to
use
against
them
in
union
elections.
it
creates
a
threat
of
ultimate
deportation
and
cast
a
cloud
on
his
whole
future.
he
can't
make
plans
while
such
a
proceeding
is
pending.
this
court
has
said
that
denaturalization
carries
the
laws
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living.
and
congress
when
it
passed
the
statute
in
1906
considerate
of
the
immigrants
who
were
coming
into
this
country
by
the
million
at
that
time
and
of
there
frequent
lack
of
adequate
legal
protection
and
advice
on
the
laws,
congress
enacted
a
self-contained
statute
with
provisions
for
the
protection
of
the
defendant
with
provisions
that
he
might
be
sued
for
denaturalization
only
in
the
district
where
he
lives.
that
they'd
be
given
60
days
notice
of
the
proceedings
against
them
and
that
the
complaint
to
be
based
upon
affidavit
showing
good
cause.
i
believe
so
that
he
can
look
at
that
affidavit
and
know
something
actual
about
the
facts
during
that
60
days
that
he
was
preparing.
and
we
think
we're
asking
for
something
the
statute
entitles
us
to.
something
of
a
serious
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
right
at
stake
requires
that
something
that
the
government
can
reasonably
be
asked
to
furnish
it.
thank
you.
