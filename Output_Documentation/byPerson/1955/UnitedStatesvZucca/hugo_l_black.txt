which
--
which
language
have
you
referred
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
about
the
by
--
bypass?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
language
of
the
statute
do
you
say
they
bypassed?
i
understood
you
to
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
to
the
--
i'm
sure
it's
my
fault,
but
i
haven't
quite
understood
your
argument
(inaudible)
i
understand
that
you
say
that
the
first
part
of
section
340
which
requires
an
affidavit
before
instituting
a
proceeding
is
better
to
push
him
from
the
outside
but
there's
something
else
in
this
statute
which
authorizes
the
institution
without
that
affidavit,
where
is
that?
what
language
do
you
approach
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
going
the
general
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
general
authority
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
first
--
the
first
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
you
start?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
--
you're
not
claiming
as
i
gather
that
the
affidavit
must
be
made
by
an
eye
witness
to
the
(inaudible)
that
the
charge
to
justify
denaturalization.
you're
saying
it
has
to
be
made
by
somebody
on
information
and
belief
and
set
out
enough
to
show
that
there
is
a
good
ground
to
believing,
information
and
possession
whether
he
has
enough
to
grant
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
he
doesn't
need
to
be
an
eye
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
that
the
government
wanted
to
test
out
this
and
that's
all
they
put
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
is
the
one
and
that
they
had
to
make
an
affidavit.
i
didn't
understand
from
the
counsel
that
they
were
claiming
is
so
insufficient.
has
--
has
it
been
claimed
that
this
is
sufficient
anywhere
in
the
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
as
far.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
there's
someone,
your
defendant
testified
before
the
immigration
officer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
won't
--
won't
let
you
know
what
he
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
get
that
quite
mr.
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
haven't
gotten
to
that
point.
we
had
various
--
we
had
a
motion
pending
on
such
matters
before
judge
bicks,
which
was
held
in
advance
while
judge
palmieri
decided
this
motion,
it's
dismissed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
since
when
was
--
when
was
it
--
you
confuse
me
now,
the
act
was
passed
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
now
how
long
after
that?
i'm
a
little
confused
now
about
your
answer
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
chief
justice
a
moment
ago.
how
long
was
it
after
that?
how
many
years
after
that
the
department
continued
to
require
affidavits
and
to
use
affidavits
in
connection
with
the
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1923?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
up
to
that
time
what
was
it
--
what
the
--
they
--
the
department
should
know,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
refer
the
case,
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
the
cases
since
then
up
to
1923,
were
they
started
after
affidavits
were
made
(voice
