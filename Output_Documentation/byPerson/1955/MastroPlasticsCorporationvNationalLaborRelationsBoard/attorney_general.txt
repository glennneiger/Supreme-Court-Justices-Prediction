mr.
attorney
general
--
mill
workers
promptly
intervene
and
asked
that
it
be
certified.
mastro,
at
first,
had
the
corporation
of
its
employees,
who
would
do
there
membership
from
their
presently
designated
representative,
the
carpenters,
and
joined
318.
however,
this
did
not
last
long.
many
of
the
employees
return
to
the
carpenters
and
then
actively
resisted
the
further
efforts
of
mastro
to
--
to
favor
318.
mastro,
nevertheless,
continued
his
effort.
it
paid
its
employees
for
the
time
spent
in
the
campaign
and
its
supervisors
threatened
its
employees
of
discharge
unless
they
cooperate
with
it.
obviously,
mastro's
conduct,
whatever
its
motive
may
have
been,
amounted
to
flagrant
unfair
labor
practice,
and
thus,
taking
to
induce
its
employees
to
abandon
the
representative
of
their
own
choice
in
favor
of
number
318,
chosen
for
them
by
their
employer.
finally,
when
an
employee
over
for
four
years
standing
were
discharged
by
mastro
on
november
10th,
1950,
because
of
his
insistence
adherence
--
its
insistence
adherence
to
the
carpenters
and
because
of
his
unwillingness
to
campaign
for
318,
many
of
mastro's
employees
at
once
went
on
strike.
the
record
merely
shows
and
the
board
leader
found
specifically
that
this
strike
was
solely
in
protest
against
the
employers'
unfair
labor
practices
in
this
representation
campaign
and
not
in
furtherance
of
any
economic
demand.
the
strike
involved
no
violence,
and
in
due
cause,
the
carpenters
filed
their
charges
in
the
labor
board
complaining
of
mastro's
unfair
labor
practices.
the
result
was
that
local
65
and
318
withdrew
their
proceedings.
the
carpenters
filed
their
petition
for
certification
and
the
board
postponed
all
elections
until
--
in
a
more
appropriate
time
and
the
general
counsel
filed
the
carpenters'
complaint
against
mastro's
alleged
unfair
labor
practices,
and
then
filed
the
complaint
based
on
the
charges
made
by
the
carpenters.
that
complaint
asked
for
the
reinstatement
with
back
pay
of
the
employees
who
would
struck
in
protest
against
mastro's
practices
and
would
not
been
reinstated,
although
they
had
offered
to
return
long
ago.
in
answer
to
this,
to
--
to
the
board's
complaint,
mastro
has
then
opposed
two
affirmative
defenses.
first,
it
claims
that
the
employees
by
striking
have
violated
the
strike-waiver
clause
in
their
existing
contract,
thus,
losing
their
right
to
reinstatement.
and
second,
that
also,
under
section
8
(d)
of
the
act,
they
have,
by
striking
loss
all
right
to
reinstatement.
the
trial
examiner
made
detailed
findings
and
recommended
that
mastro
be
ordered
to
cease
and
desist
its
course
of
practices
and
grant
full
reinstatement
with
back
pay
to
the
discharged
employees.
the
board
adopted
the
examiner's
recommendations
and
the
court
of
appeals,
for
the
second
circuit,
followed
the
board.
since
then,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
seventh
circuit
had
restated
similar
conclusion
because
the
importance
of
the
case
were
granted
certiorari.
mastro's
first
defense
is
that
its
existing
collective
bargaining
contract
with
the
--
with
the
carpenters
was
made
to
cover
the
year
beginning,
december
1st,
1949.
accordingly,
that
contract
had
20
days
to
run
when
the
strike
began
on
november
10.
and
mastro
now
argues
that
until
november
30th,
the
strike-waiver
clause
in
that
contract
precluded
the
employees
from
striking
not
only
for
modifications
and
their
economic
relations,
such
as
recovered
by
that
contract,
but
for
any
reason
even
against
that
flagrantly
unfair
labor
practices,
as
occurred
here,
seeking
to
oust
the
employees
duly
designated
bargaining
representative.
in
support
of
its
contention,
mastro
points
to
the
precise
words
of
the
waiver
clause
in
its
contract.
mastro
claims
that
the
clause
waives
the
employees'
right
to
strike,
even
under
the
most
provocative
unfair
labor
practices
because
the
clause
says,
"the
union
further
agrees
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
any
strike
by
work
stoppage
during
the
term
of
this
agreement."
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
if
read
and
complete
isolation,
such
words
may
be
so
interpreted
as
waiving
for
one
year,
the
employees
right
to
strike
for
any
cause,
whatsoever.
on
the
other
hand,
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
point
out
that
these
words
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
rest
of
the
contract
in
which
they
appear
under
the
existing
law
the
time
of
the
contract
was
made.
they
point
out
that
the
labor
relations
act
is
amended
and
in
effect
at
that
time
at
a
dual
purpose,
first,
to
assure
a
freedom
of
effective
negotiation
between
employees
and
there
employers,
and
second,
to
adjust
the
economic
differences
by
collective
bargaining
without
suffering
avoidable
interruptions
of
their
production.
under
that
act,
it
is
natural
and
common
fractures,
therefore,
for
a
fairly
negotiated
collective
bargaining
contract
to
provide
that
wages,
hours
of
work,
and
other
conditions
of
employment
thus
negotiated
continue
as
they
were
for
at
least
a
year.
and
it
provide
that
no
strike
or
work
stoppage
should
be
engaged
in
to
order
those
terms
during
the
light
of
that
agreement.
in
other
words,
they
agree
to
leave
such
matters
to
peaceful
negotiations.
this,
however,
necessarily
assumed
that
the
parties
would
and
did
really
choose
their
respective
bargaining
representative
to
do
the
negotiating
for
them.
also,
while
it
was
natural
to
insert
in
such
a
contract
and
express
waiver
for
a
year
of
the
right
to
strike
for
further
economic
benefits,
it
is
not
natural
to
deprive
the
employees
for
any
period
--
for
any
period
of
their
freedom
to
choose
their
own
bargaining
representative.
reading
the
present
contract
as
a
whole,
we
find
that
it
refers
exclusively
to
the
subject
matter
of
negotiation
such
as
wages,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment.
we
conclude
that
do
interpret
its
strike-waiver
clause,
as
referring
only
to
those
matters,
is
a
natural
interpretation
of
it.
on
the
other
hand,
we
--
we
conclude
that
reading
it
is
also
waiving
the
employees
right
to
strike
in
protest
against
coercion
seeking
to
deprive
them
of
their
choice
of
their
collective
bargaining
representative,
if
not
a
natural
or
permissible
interpretation
of
it
at
least
without
some
more
specific
and
compelling
expression
of
that
meaning
then
appears
in
the
clause
which
i
just
read.
the
trial
examiner,
the
entire
labor
relation
board
and
the
entire
viewing
court
agree
with
that
interpretation
of
the
contract.
such
unanimity
is
entitled
the
much
weight
because
this
contract
is
a
difficult
collective
bargaining
contract
with
which
the
board
is
thoroughly
familiar.
we
accordingly
agree
with
them
that
while
the
clause
thus
waive
for
a
year,
the
employees'
right
to
strike
for
different
terms
of
employment,
it
is
not
waived
for
any
period,
their
fundamental
right
to
strike
against
the
unlawful
intrusion
which
occurred
here
into
their
basic
freedom
of
collective
action.
the
petitioner's
second
affirmative
defense
is
at
section
8
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
as
amended
in
1947,
has
deprived
the
workers
in
this
case
of
their
status
as
employees
and
of
their
consequent
right
to
reinstatement
because
they
struck
during
the
sixty-day
period
that
it
made
available
by
the
act
when
negotiating
of
terms
and
employment
just
prior
to
the
expiration
of
each
collective
bargaining
contract.
section
(8)
(d)
provides
that
either
party
to
a
collective
bargaining
contract
who
may
desire
modification
of
its
term
shall
give
to
the
other
a
notice
to
that
effect,
60
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
and
during
that
sixty-day
period,
such
party
shall
not
resort
to
strike
or
lock
out.
section
(8)
(d)
also
expressly
state
that
"any
employees
engages
in
a
strike
within
the
sixty-day
period
specified
in
this
subsection
shall
lose
his
status
as
an
employee."
such
loss
of
status
carries
with
it
a
loss
of
his
right
to
reinstatement
of
back
pay.
in
the
instant
case,
the
employees
on
october
10th
give
appropriate
notice
of
their
desire
to
modify
their
existing
contract
which
was
due
to
expire
on
november
30th.
it
is
conceded
therefore,
that
the
sixty-day
negotiation
period
was
put
in
operation.
the
employees
also
made
known
several
of
their
demands
for
modification
of
their
contract.
it
happened,
however,
that
during
the
next
month,
on
november
10th,
the
strike
occurred.
however,
the
board
has
expressly
found
that
such
strike
was
not
in
support
of
any
economic
demands.
it
was
solely
to
protest
against
mastro's
unfair
labor
practices
which
sought
by
coercion
to
substitute
mastro's
choice
of
a
new
bargaining
agent
where
the
employees
in
place
of
the
existing
agent
of
their
own
choice.
here
again,
therefore,
if
the
words
ought
to
be
interpreted
as
read
in
complete
isolation,
it
may
be
said
to
cover
all
strikes
regardless
of
the
purpose
or
the
provocation
for
those
strikes.
again,
however,
the
words
must
be
read
in
their
context.
this
time,
the
context
consists
of
a
statutory
section
8
(d)
and
of
the
act
as
a
whole.
we
accordingly
meet
again
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
act
to
protect
the
employees'
freedom
of
concerted
action
including
their
freedom
to
choose
their
own
bargaining
representative.
this
purpose
is
affirmatively
expressed
and
emphasized
throughout
section
7
and
8
of
the
act.
the
inclusion
in
section
8
(d)
of
a
clause
now
before
us
is
justified
as
the
explicitly
warning
employees
of
there
loss
of
their
status
as
employees
if
during
the
60-day
negotiating
period,
they
engaged
in
a
strike
instead
of
in
peaceful
negotiation
to
obtain
economic
benefits.
in
our
opinion,
the
clause
does
not,
however,
use
sufficiently
explicit
language
for
us
to
construe
it
as
also
limiting
the
affirmatively
protected
and
fundamental
right
of
employees
to
engage
in
a
strike,
to
protest
against
unlawful
labor
practices
of
the
employer,
to
seek
to
deprive
the
pride
of
the
employees
of
their
chosen
agent
in
negotiations
of
the
very
kind
for
which
the
60-day
period
is
set
aside,
to
adopt
the
petition
of
interpretation
would
produce
in
congress
result.
in
effect,
it
would
deprive
the
employees
of
their
traditional
and
most
effective
defense
of
their
independent
bargaining
representative
at
the
very
time
when
their
need
for
such
representation
was
the
most
obvious.
while
the
request
of
the
employees
for
modification
of
their
terms
of
employment
does
demonstrate
their
immediate
needs
for
the
services
of
their
freely
chosen
representative,
the
petitioners
would
relegate
the
employees
to
filing
charges
on
the
board
procedures
too
slow
to
be
effective.
such
an
interpretation
would
favor
the
employer
in
its
unlawful
conduct
and
to
handicap
the
employees
contrary
to
purpose
of
the
act.
moreover,
we
believe
that
there
is
inherent
inequity
in
any
interpretation
that
penalizes
one
party
to
a
contract
for
its
conduct
that
it's
clearly
induced
solely
by
the
unlawful
conduct
of
the
other.
such
an
interpretation
gives
advantage
to
the
wrong
doing.
finally,
resulting
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
we
find
it
not
conclusive
but
at
least
consistent
with
the
position
we
have
taken.
with
exception
of
one
suggestion
made
in
a
minority
report,
the
language
in
question
is
uniformly
treated
as
applicable
to
strikes
for
economic
benefits.
without
suggestions,
the
language
must
apply
also
to
strikes
directly
--
directed
solely
against
unfair
labor
practices.
the
suggestion
to
the
contrary
made
in
the
minority
report
cannot
put
words
into
the
mouth
of
the
majority,
because
in
our
view,
neither
the
strike-waiver
clause
in
neglected
bargaining
contract
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
act
stands
in
the
way
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
