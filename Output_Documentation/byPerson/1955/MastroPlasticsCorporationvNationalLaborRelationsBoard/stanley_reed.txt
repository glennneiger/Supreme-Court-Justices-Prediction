failure
of

would

justice
stanley

meant
to
reach
--
meant
to
bar
employees
from
going
out
on
a
strike
in
protest
against
unfair
labor
practice
--
against
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
there
are
two
answers
i
think
to
this
argument.
first
of
all,
all
that
the
last
sentence
of
section
8
(d)
does
is
simply
proscribe
the
sanctions
which
the
employees
will
incur
if
they
go
out
on
strike
--
they
go
out
on
the
strike
of
the
kind
that
section
8
(d)
contemplates.
in
other
words,
congress
is
saying,
if
you
go
out
on
the
type
of
strike
that
we
have
set
forth
or
described
in
section
8
(d),
you
will
lose
whatever
right
you
may
have
had
to
complain
about
the
employer's
failure
to
reinstate
you
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8,
you
will
lose
whatever
voting
rights
you
may
have
had
under
section
9,
and
you
will
lose
any
--
you
will
lose
any
right
to
invoke
the
processes
of
the
board
under
section
10
for
relief.
but,
in
order
to
determine,
however,
what
kind
of
strike
congress
had
in
mind
and
to
what
kind
of
a
strike
these
sanctions
apply,
we
have
to
look
to
the
rest
of
this
section,
as
i
have
indicated.and,
when
you
look
to
the
rest
of
the
section,
as
i
have
said,
its
seems
quite
evident
to
us
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
a
strike
in
support
of
contract
demands
during
this
waiting
periods
and
not
strikes
to
protest
the
employer's
commission
of
unfair
labor
practices,
as
in
this
case.
secondly,
there
is
a
simple
and,
what
i
believe
to
be,
an
adequate
explanation
for
congress
having
provided
that
the
employees
who
went
out
on
a
strike
of
this
kind
would
lose
their
status
under
sections
8,
9,
and
10.
under
board
decisions,
an
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike
misconduct
does
not
necessarily
lose
his
right
to
read
his
employee
status,
vis
a
vis
to
a
particular
employer,
or
his
right
to
reinstatement.
the
board,
in
such
situations,
weigh
such
factors
as
employer
provocation,
the
seriousness
of
misconduct,
and
other
surrounding
circumstances.
and,
weighing
these
factors,
the
board
then
comes
to
the
--
determination,
makes
a
judgment
whether
it
would
or
would
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
statute
to
require
the
reinstatement
of
this
particular
employee
who
was
engaged
in
a
certain
type
of
strike
or
misconduct.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress,
in
considering
the
1947
amendments,
was
aware
of
the
board's
practice
in
this
respect.
and,
section
8
(d),
it
seems
to
us,
discloses
an
intention
to
take
away
form
the
board
any
power,
with
respect
to
section
8
(d)
strikers,
to
make
a
determination
whether
or
not
the
reinstatement
of
the
strikers
who
had
failed
to
abide
by
the
requirements
of
section
8
(d)
whether
or
not
their
reinstatement
would
or
would
not,
in
the
particular
circumstances,
effectuate
the
powers
of
the
statute.
justice
stanley
reed
it
indicates
an
intention
to
take
that
power
away
from
the
board
with
respect
to
section
8
(d)
strikers.
in
other
words,
congress,
as
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
congress
made
that
determination
itself.
it
didn't
leave
it
to
the
board
but
made
that
determination
itself
and
said,
“now,
if
you
engage
in
this
type
of
strike,
you
will
automatically
--
automatically,
upon
going
out
on
this
kind
of
a
strike,
you
will
automatically
lose
your
status
as
employee
for
purposes
of
sections
8,
9
and
10.”
it
has
left
no
--
justice
stanley
reed
it
has
left
--
i'm
sorry.
it
has
--
it
has
left
no
room
for
the
board's
judgment
or
weighing
the
factors
in
this
particular
situation
as
the
board
may
have
in
another
cases
involving
strike
misconduct.
congress
itself,
as
i
say,
made
the
determination
and
said,
“we
will
put
it
in
the
statute,
any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike
of
this
kind
that
we've
described
in
section
8
(d),
we
think,
is
so
serious
that
you
should
be
automatically
disqualified,”
