justice
felix
frankfurter
for
your
purposes
and
our
purposes,
the
picture
you
are
making
is
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
goes
on
the
question
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
union
would,
as
the
employer
stated
--
i'm
not
suggesting
it
makes
any
difference,
but
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
company
used
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
it
makes
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
but
if
you're
right
about
this,
then
we're
going
to
turn
to
the
more
important
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
if
they
don't
prove
that
it
stated
that
this
--
that
they
do
not
strike,
if
their
strike
is
in
violation
and
then
you
review
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
agreement
is
in
making
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
what
provision
of
8
(d)
would
tell
us
it's
in
--
i
thought
the
crucial
provision
which
reference
to
you've
made
is
that
they
must
not
resort
to
self-remedy
but
must
go
to
the
board
because
they
submitted
themselves
to
that
by
the
agreement.
now,
if
they
hadn't
permitted
to
further
this
by
that
agreement,
how
are
they
commended
their
right
to
strike?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
when
i
said
we
don't
come
to
that,
just
what
provision
of
8
(d)
would
they
infringe
by
such?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
strike
without
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
strike
without
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
from
the
time
of
strike,
you
mean
the
60
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he
does
that
--
if
he
does
that,
that's
the
remedy
becomes,
in
your
construction,
delayed.
there's
nothing
that
can
be
done
here
basically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
go
out
on
strike
and,
eventually,
be
reinstated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the
only
--
the
only
control
against
the
employers
doing
it
is
that,
eventually,
he
may
have
to
pay
and
retake
--
and
take
them
back.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
something
he
could
do
against
--
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
less
you
can
do
against
the
unfair
labor
practices
if
he
wants
to
indulge
in
them
that
we
couldn't
do
without
your
consent.
so
far
as
immediate
remedy
goes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
--
anything
to
penalize
the
employer
or
lockup
the
way
this
penalizes
an
employee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
bring
this
situation
to
pass
by
a
lockout,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
penalty
to
discourage
them,
other
than
the
fact
that
he
can
bring
it
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
here,
there's
a
loss
of
status
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
i'm
sorry,
mr.
manoli.
did
you
say
it
does
not
indicate
--
it
indicates
an
intention
not
to
take
that
power
away?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
it
just
figured
that
you
lose
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
purposes
of
sections
8,
9,
and
10
insofar
as
his
right
to
vote
is
concerned,
insofar
as
his
right
to
reinstatement
may
be
involved,
and
insofar
as
he
may
ask
for
relief
from
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
it
doesn't
take
very
--
take
me
very
far
from
reaching
the
questions
put
to
you
by
mr.
justice
harlan
that
congress
may
also
have
changed
the
wording
but
you
know
even
better
than
i
it's
not
always
an
easy
question
as
to
where
the
gravamen,
whether
this
was
an
economic
strike
or
was
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike.
those
are
not
easy
mathematical
questions.
nobody
knows
better
than
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
congress
may
well
have
been,
but
it
will
take
the
whole
thing
away
and
not
to
leave
it
for
determination
before
the
board,
consolably
restricting
evidence
as
to
where
the
blame
lies
are
being
entered
into
the
daring
territory
of
the
fact
that
you
believe
is
what
decides
to
be
brought.
now,
leave
that
to
him.
under
practical
terms,
it's
not
even
determined
which
is
which,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
congress
may
have
thought
we
wouldn't
agree
with
you
and
say
“we
want
to
encourage
you
to
resort
to
a
strike.”
that's
all
this
was
in
the
congress.
this
did
not
--
it
didn't
arise
from
the
tentative
consideration
of
the
case
you
insisted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
including
it.
i'm
deciding
you
do
this.
everyone
in
congress
needs
me
to
decide
what
i
believe
is
not
disclosed
before
somebody
not
in
comparison
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
proposed
it?
do
you
know
who
proposed
it
in
the
senate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
in
the
manner
of
terminology,
mr.
riley
is
an
adviser
to
the
senate
committee
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
acting
as
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
matter
of
terminology.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
was
there
any
reference
to
this
in
the
president's
veto
message?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
this
is
a
very
active
provision
of
the
law.
i
mean,
have
these
situations
are
really
been
frequent
before
your
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
a
question
of
assessing
it
in
the
period
from
--
of
60
days?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
problem.
