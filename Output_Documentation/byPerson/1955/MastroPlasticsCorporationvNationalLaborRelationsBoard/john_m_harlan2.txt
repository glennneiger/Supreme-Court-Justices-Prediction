when
did
the
unfair
labor
practices
begin
with
reference
to
the
beginning
day
of
the
60-day
period?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
it
be
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
making
the
act
broad,
as
your
opponents
claim,
the
no-strike
provision
broad
was
because
of
the
difficulty
in
defining
the
motives
for
strikes?
justice

harlan
the
net
of
the
legislative
history
is
it
isn't
very
illuminating.
