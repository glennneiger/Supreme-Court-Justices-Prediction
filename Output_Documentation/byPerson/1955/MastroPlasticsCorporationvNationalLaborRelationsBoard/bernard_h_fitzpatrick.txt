mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
if
the
court
please,
this
case
is
here
on
petition
of
--
for
certiorari
for
the
examination
of
two
questions
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
affirmed
on
appeal
by
the
second
circuit.
the
two
questions
will
designate,
first,
the
loss
of
status
question
that
arises
under
section
8
(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
we'll
advert
to
at
more
length
in
a
few
moments.
the
second
question
which
was
allowed
on
the
petition
for
the
writ
was
the
contract
question,
that
is,
whether
the
board
properly
found
that
the
strike
involved
in
this
issue
--
in
this
proceeding
was
not
a
violation
of
a
no-strike
commitment
made
in
a
contract
by
one
of
the
unions
involved.
now,
i'm
going
to
make
a
rather
brief
truncated
statement
of
the
facts
because
that
is
all
that's
required
to
raise
the
strict
issues
of
law
here.
however,
i
may,
later
on
in
the
argument,
advert
to
certain
facts
which
i
do
not
state
at
this
time
not
because
i
think
that
there
are
necessary
to
raise
the
issues,
but
because
they
may
throw
some
light
on
the
reasons
why
congress
undertook
to
an
act
as
brought
an
act
as
it
did
here.
the
petitioner,
to
get
on
with
the
facts,
operates
a
plant
in
new
york
city.
in
1949,
it
entered
into
a
collective
bargaining
contract
with
a
union,
local
22045,
a
federal
union
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
which,
then,
was
unquestionably
the
representative
of
the
employees
concerned.
that
contract
contained
a
no-strike
clause,
the
language
of
which
we
will
get
to
in
its
appropriate
place.
the
contract
was
about
half
expired
when,
in
august
of
1950,
a
cio
union,
local
65
of
the
merchandise
workers,
i
believe
it
is,
made
an
organizational
attack
on
the
plant
and
it
met
with
a
good
deal
of
success,
at
least
sufficient
to
enable
it
to
file
a
petition
for
recognition
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
latter
part
of
september.
meanwhile,
the
incumbent
union,
local
22045,
had
demanded
on
about
september
7th,
some
weeks
before
its
60-day
renewal
period
of
its
contract
approached,
an
increase
of
wages
in
the
amount
of
12-and-a
half
cents
per
hour,
and
that
was
all.
the
petitioner
here
was
admittedly
concerned
with
the
reputation
of
the
assaulting
union,
local
65,
as
being
inflicted
or
infiltrated
with
communism,
which
he
opposed.
he
proposed,
therefore,
to
the
incumbent
union
that
they
join
together
to
take
steps
to
combat
the
rating
union,
local
65.
they
believed,
however,
that
the
incumbent
was
a
bit
too
weak
to
cope
with
the
situation
and,
so,
he
got
in
touch
with
another
union,
a
local
318
of
the
pulp
and
sulphite
workers.
and,
he
sought
to
induce
the
incumbent,
local
22045,
to
turn
over
the
bargaining
agency
to
this
local
318
of
the
pulp
and
sulphite
workers.
that
attempt
to
induce
a
voluntary
turnover
of
the
agency
failed
and
it
is
found,
and
we
do
not
now
deny
before
this
court,
that
the
petitioner,
thereupon,
committed
a
series
of
unfair
labor
practices
which
may
be
summed
up
as
supporting
an
organizational
drive
in
support
of
local
318
of
the
pulp
and
sulphite
workers.
there
was
one
additional
unfair
labor
practice
to
which
i'll
advert
in
a
moment.
in
october
of
1950,
we
have
this
situation
then
that
the
representation
proceeding
was
pending.
the
employer
supported,
and
which
board
--
the
board
properly
held
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
an
organizational
drive
to
unseat
the
bargaining
agent.
and,
the
bargaining
agent
itself
reacted
by
upping
its
demands
to
25
cents
per
hour
and
including
a
demand
for
a
welfare
fund.
at
some
later
point,
in
the
dealings
between
then
and
the
time
of
the
strike
which
i'm
about
to
come
to,
local
22045
concluded
that
it
itself
wished
to
transfer
its
bargaining
rights
to
the
carpenters
union,
a
local
3127.
the
reason
why
it
said
it
wanted
to
do
that
was
because
the
bargaining
--
because
the
carpenters
union
was
equipped
to
administer
the
welfare
fund
which
it
had
demanded,
and
it
itself
was
not.
we
come
down
to
november
10th,
then,
with
the
situation
of
three,
at
least,
contending
interests
on
the
union's
side,
local
65,
local
318,
and
this
hybrid
local
22045-3127.
on
november
10th,
there
was
an
employee
by
the
name
of
ciccone,
employed
in
the
machine
shop,
and
he
had,
unquestionably,
been
soliciting
on
behalf
of
the
22045-3127
combination.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
we
are
in
no
position
to
contest
that
at
this
level.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
let
me
distinguish
on
your
use
of
the
word
"caused".
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
will
admit
that
the
employees
struck
in
response
to
the
unfair
labor
practices.
that
is
as
far
as
i
will
admit
to
a
chain
of
causation.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
the
court's
findings
paralleled
the
board
precisely.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
they
--
paralleled
the
boards
precisely.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
the
board
found
that
--
its
terminology
was
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
is
caused.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
well,
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
scientific
notion,
of
course,
in
the
sense
in
which
the
board
used
it.
i
--
i
said
that
the
board
found
that
strike
was
caused
by
the
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
that
does
not
mean,
and
the
board
did
not
intend
to
find,
that
this
employer
physically
ousted
these
people
from
the
premises
wherefore
they're
being
divorced
from
their
occupation,
there
was
a
strike.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it
will
not
be,
i
think,
your
honor,
as
we
proceed
with
the
argument.
there
is
an
argument,
when
i
get
to
the
contract
phase
of
this,
advanced
by
my
opponent
on
which
i
think
you
will
find
that
it
may
be
quite
material.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
well,
the
board
draws
a
conclusion
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
let
me
anticipate
it.
the
board
--
the
board
draws
a
conclusion
or,
rather,
counsel
for
the
board
draws
a
conclusion
which
is,
i
think,
supported
by
the
board's
own
opinion
of
the
case,
and
his
conclusion
is
this.
that
you
cannot
assert,
as
a
defense,
your
no-strike
clause
for
the
reason
that
the
strike
was
caused
by
unfair
labor
practices
and
you
cannot
take
advantage
of
your
own
wrong.
now,
we
would
say
that
if
“course”
were
used
in
the
absolute
scientific
sense
by
the
board,
that
that
would
be
valid.
however,
intervening
between
the
unfair
labor
practice,
which
is
the
stated
cause,
and
the
result
which
is
the
strike,
you
have
the
voluntary
action
of
the
strikers.
they
don't
have
to
strike.
nobody
forced
them
to
strike.
the
strike
wasn't
caused
in
the
scientific
sense.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
would
say
that,
in
this
precise
connection,
if
there
were
such
a
connection
between
the
asserted
cause
and
the
asserted
result
that
one
inevitably
flowed
from
the
other,
the
connection
would
be
scientific,
but
they
are
voluntary
intervening
acts
of
parties
not
under
the
control
of
the
petitioner.
and,
i
say
that
when
the
board
says
the
strike
was
caused
by
the
unfair
labor
practices,
we
will
admit
that
but
only
in
the
sense
that
the
strike
action
was
taken
voluntarily
in
response
to
the
unfair
labor
practices
which
were
committed.
on
november
10th,
then,
ciccone
is
employed
in
the
machine
shop.
he
is
distributing
literature
or
soliciting
signatures
on
behalf
of
the
--
let's
call
it
the
incumbent
carpenters
union.
i
think
for
all
practical
purposes,
we
may
assume
that
the
incumbent
and
the
carpenters
union
were
one
and
the
same.
they
had
the
same
officers,
same
offices,
and
one
appeared
to
be
the
alter
ego
of
the
other.
they
have
been
so
treated
below.
the
president
of
the
petitioner
tells
him
to
stop
his
duties
which
were
of
a
roving
character
and
confine
his
activities
to
the
machine
shop
for
the
balance
of
that
day.
the
president's
--
the
president
of
the
petitioner
was
going
downtown
to
a
board
of
directors
meeting.
at
about
--
that
was
about
noon
time.
at
somewhere
around
the
hour
of
3
o'clock
that
afternoon,
it
was
reported
to
the
president
who
had
called
into
the
plant
over
the
telephone
that
ciccone
was
out
of
his
department,
he
ordered
ciccone
fired,
the
rest
of
the
machine
shop
stopped
within
10
minutes
after
the
firing
of
ciccone.
some
other
departments
stropped
within,
let's
say,
a
half-hour
after
that.
the
balance
of
the
plant
continued
working
that
day,
including
the
night
shift
which
came
on
later
but,
the
following
morning,
there
was
a
picket
line
--
i
should
say,
a
picket
line
was
established
outside
that
afternoon
rather
quickly.
and,
the
following
morning,
there
picket
line
continued
under
the
auspices
of
the
carpenters
union,
local
3127
and
the
plant,
for
all
practical
purposes,
was
down
and
on
a
strike.
that
was
november
11th.
the
plant
did
not
resume
operation
until
december
11th.
and,
at
that
time,
all
who
did
not
return
to
work,
some-70
odd
in
number
who
are
the
dischargees
which
are
the
subject
of
this
order,
were
discharged
by
the
company
and
they
have
never
been
reinstated.
now,
they
are
the
underlying
facts.
there
were
two
defenses
asserted
by
petitioner
below.
and,
the
first
of
these
was
that
the
employees
involved
strikers,
which
are
the
subject
and
the
reinstatement
order,
had
lost
their
status
under
section
8
(d)
of
the
act.
one
of
the
phrases
in
--
in
section
8
(d)
is
“any
employee
who
strikes”
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
oh
yes,
they
made
a
bid
for
reinstatement
but
not
until
march
of
the
succeeding
year.
and,
there
is
no
question
that
none
of
them
--
that
any
of
them
has
ever
been
reemployed.
the
specific
portion
of
the
act
involved
--
reads,
“any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike
within
the
60-day
period
specified
in
this
subsection
shall
lose
his
status
as
an
employee
of
the
employer
engaged
in
the
particular
labor
dispute
for
the
purposes
of
section
8,
9,
and
10
of
this
act
as
amended.
but,
such
loss
of
status
for
such
employee
shall
terminate
if
and
when
he
is
reemployed
by
such
employer.”
now,
it
is
not
enough
for
me
merely
to
read
that.
i
will
summarize
what
goes
before.
that
appears
in
a
section,
8
(d),
which
is
basically
designed
to
define
what
collective
bargaining
is,
and
it
gives,
in
the
forepart
of
the
section,
a
generic
definition
of
collective
bargaining.
and,
in
the
latter
part
of
the
section
under
a
proviso
clause,
it
gives
a
definition
of
what
collective
bargaining
consists
of
where
there
is
in
existence
a
contract.
roughly,
that
runs,
provided
that
where
there
is,
in
effect,
a
collective
bargaining
contract
covering
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce,
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
shall
also
mean
that
no
party
to
such
contract
shall
terminate
or
modify
such
contract,
unless
the
party
desiring
such
termination
or
modification
takes
several
steps.
among
which,
are
notifies
the
other
party
to
the
contract
that
it
desires
the
termination
60-days
prior
to
the
termination
desired,
notifies
the
mediation
service
30
days
thereafter
of
the
continued
existence
of
a
labor
dispute,
offers
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
other
party
on
the
terms
of
the
renewal.
and,
finally,
continues
in
full
force
and
effect,
without
resorting
to
strike
or
lockout,
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
existing
contract
for
a
period
of
60
days
after
such
notice
as
--
is
given
or
until
the
expiration
of
such
contract,
whichever
occurs
later.
now,
then,
with
some
intervening
matter
of
no
immediate
consequence,
we
find
the
loss-of-status
clause,
which
goes
on
as
i
read
before,
“any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike
within
the
60-day
period,
and
specified
in
this
subsection,
shall
lose
his
status
as
an
employee
of
the
employer
engaged
in
the
particular
labor
dispute
for
the
purposes
of
section
8,
9,
and
10
of
the
act.”
now,
that
defense
was
asserted
below,
that
is,
we
said
these
employees
struck
within
that
60-day
period.
a
notice
of
termination
had
been
served
on
october
10th,
1950.
that
would
have
made
a
60-day
period
extending
from
october
10th
to
december
10th.
the
strike
here
occurred
on
the
10th
of
november
and
continued
thereafter.
we
said,
therefore,
these
employees
have
lost
status.
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
order
which
it
has
entered
here
because
none
of
the
subjects
of
that
order
are
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
having
lost
that
status.
now,
the
treatment
of
our
objection
and
defense
by
the
board
was
this,
and
i
must
admit
that
i
can't
quite
say
what
the
scope
of
the
decisions
below
is.
the
board
says,
“well,
congresses”
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
there
is
not.
so,
the
only
sanction
on
the
employer
in
these
premises
is
the
entry
against
him
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
order.
that
is
a
cease
and
desist
order
which
may,
of
course,
incorporate
reinstatement
of
back-pay.
the
employer
is
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
the
--
the
union
terminating
a
contract
in
disregard
of
the
specified
procedures
is
also
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
but
the
terminal
sentence
of
the
clause
refers
not
to
unions,
not
to
employers,
but
to
individual
employees.
it
says
“any
employee.”
i'll
expatiate
on
the
language
later
on.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
he
loses
his
remedy
before
the
board.
that's
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
he
doesn't
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
participate
in
the
strike.
he
forfeits
nothing,
sir.
so
that,
the
possibility
is
that
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
he
might
have
been
reinstated.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
oh
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
oh
yes.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
he
has
the
full
panoply
of
board
remedies.
he
can
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
he
can
go
in
and
file
a
charge
and
procure
reinstatement
with
back-pay.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
before
the
board.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
mr.
manoli
would
be
a
better
expert
on
that
than
i.
it
would
not
be
quite
as
expeditious.
let's
say,
as
an
equity
remedy,
i
conceive
that.
it
has
taken
months,
i
will
also
conceive
that.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it
has
never
taken
less
than
months,
to
my
knowledge,
except
in
the
case
of
informal
adjustments.
now,
there
are
a
lot
of
them
that
go
on
before
the
board,
under
its
ages
after
the
filing
of
a
charge.
there
is
a
considerable
degree
of
adjustments
undertaken
by
the
board.
and,
maybe
that
it
is
only
the
cases
which
warrant
a
trial
which
go
to
trial.
i
am
not
in
a
statistical
position
to
answer
that
one.
let
me
pick
up
now.
the
treatment
of
these
objections
below,
i
said
i
was
a
little
bit
uncertain
as
to
just
how
far
the
board
and/or
the
court
below
wanted
to
go.
they
say
that
the
loss-of-status
clause
is
a
part
of
the
section
as
a
whole
and,
of
course,
no
one
can
gain
to
say
that.
and,
they
say
the
section
as
a
whole
is
devoted
to
the
problem
of
termination
or
modification
of
a
contract.
it
specifies
the
method
whereby
collective
contracts
ought
to
be
terminated
and
modified.
therefore,
the
loss-of-status
clause,
although
its
language,
nobody
disputes
that
its
literal
language
supports
the
construction
of
petitioner
here,
although
its
language
is
broad,
its
intent
must
be
narrowed
by
the
obligations
laid
upon
the
parties
in
the
foregoing
part
of
the
section.
therefore,
when
we
have
a
strike
question
before
us,
under
the
loss-of-status
clause,
the
question
becomes,
is
it
a
strike
to
terminate
or
modify
a
contract?
now,
i've
said
that
i
was
a
little
dubious
as
to
whether
that
was
only
the
holding
below
or
whether
the
holding
was
to
be
narrowed
a
little
bit.
the
language
used
is
susceptible
of
the
interpretation
that
only
unfair
labor
practice
strikes
are
excluded
by
the
board
in
--
under
its
rule.
i
think
the
board,
perhaps,
was
a
little
bit
more
clear
on
that,
and
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
what
the
board
held
was
that
only
a
strike
designed
to
terminate
or
modify
a
contract
would
be
held
to
be
a
strike
within
the
purview
of
the
loss-of-status
clause.
now,
that
leaves
a
number
of
strikes
which
are
completely
in
the
neutral
ground,
for
instance,
a
strike
to
procure
recognition.
let's
say
that
there
is
an
incumbent
bargaining
agent
that
a
foreign
union,
such
as
local
65
in
this
case,
came
in
but,
instead
of
adopting
the
feasible
procedures
of
the
board,
suppose
it
said
to
the
employer,
“we
want
you
to
recognize
us.”
and,
the
employer
said,
“no,
i
won't
recognize
you.
look,
i've
got
an
incumbent
union.”
and,
local
65
said,
“we'll
strike.”
well,
it
might
well
be
that
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
make
that
strike
effective
whether
or
not
they
represented
the
majority.
under
the
board
rule,
as
i
read
it
to
my
best
judgment,
the
board
would
say
that
such
a
strike,
again,
is
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
loss-of-status
clause.
in
other
words,
the
striking
employees
in
that
case
would
work
no
forfeiture
of
there
remedies
upon
themselves.
the
second
circuit,
i
think,
was
a
little
bit
more
cloudy
in
its
construction.
i
don't
think
it
knew
quite
whether
it
wanted
to
hold
the
position
that
i've
just
described
or
whether
it
merely
wanted
to
see
that
unfair
labor
practice
strikers
were
not
denied
the
remedies
prescribed
for
them
in
the
act
by
virtue
of
the
loss-of-status
clause.
the
situation
there
was
that,
between
the
time
we
had
got
the
board
decision
and
the
time
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
heard
our
argument
in
the
--
on
this
case,
the
eighth
circuit
had
decided
local
3,
united
packing
house
workers
against
nlrb,
that
was
the
wilson
&
company
case.
and,
the
board
had
predicated
much
of
its
opinion
in
our
case
on
the
wilson
case.
but,
by
the
time
we
got
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
eighth
circuit
had
reversed
the
board
on
the
wilson
doctrine.
and,
that
left
the
second
circuit
rather
hanging
in
midair.
and,
so,
it
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
perhaps
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
local
3
case
and
this
one
lying
in
the
fact
that,
here,
we
have
unfair
labor
practices
antecedent
to
the
strike,
and
in
the
local
3
case
there
were
no
such
antecedent
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
let
me
argue
the
point.
i've
already
adverted
to
the
observation
that
there
is
really
no
fact
question
underlying
the
defense.
everybody
concedes
that
the
strike
occurred
within
the
prohibited
time.
everybody
concede
that
none
of
these
employees
has
been
reemployed
so
as
to
restore
his
rights,
nor
is
there
any
question
that,
if
the
words
of
the
loss-of-status
clause
be
given
their
literal
meaning,
the
defense
should
be
upheld.
the
question
relates
solely
to
whether
is
--
whether
the
literal
meaning
is
the
meaning
to
be
adopted
or
whether
that
meaning
is
to
be
modified
by
something
else
in
the
section
or
in
the
act.
now,
let
me
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
language
of
congress
that
we
are
going
to
look
at.
any
employees
starts
off
with,
“any”
is
a
term
of
universality.
it
is
put
there
to
broaden
deliberately
the
ambit
of
employees
to
whom
this
is
to
apply,
“any
employee.”
now,
you'll
notice
later
in
the
wording,
any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike
within
the
60-day
period,
and
so
forth,
shall
lose
his
status
as
an
employee
of
the
employer
engaged
in
the
particular
labor
dispute.
now,
those
words,
particularly
“of
the
employer
engaged
in
this
particular
dispute,”
are
an
aversion
by
congress
to
the
basic
definition
of
employer
which
is
contained
in
two-three
of
the
act,
in
which
it
says
the
term
“employee”
shall
include
any
employee
and
shall
not
be
limited
to
the
employees
of
a
particular
employer
unless
the
act
explicitly
states
otherwise.
here,
the
section
is
explicitly
stating
otherwise.
and,
you
will
notice
that
two-three
goes
on
further
to
include
any
individual
whose
work
has
ceased
as
a
consequence
of
or
in
connection
with
or
because
of
any
unfair
labor
practice,
and
we
seek
to
draw
from
that,
from
the
particular
aversion
to
that
definition.
this,
that
the
congress,
when
it
rejected
a
particular
implication
of
that
definition,
accepted
what
remained
and
what
remained
was
a
definition
which
included
an
employee
whose
work
had
ceased
in
connection
with
or
as
--
as
a
result
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
let's
go
further
into
the
language
here.
any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike,
take
the
word,
"strike."
that
is
a
word
which
has
a
statutory
definition.
section
501
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
which
amended
the
wagner
act
contains
a
specific
definition
of
“strike”
which,
again,
contains
the
broad
term,
"any
strike."
now,
not
only
does
it
refer
to
any
strike,
but
that
section
gives
internal
evidence
of
having
been
drawn
precisely
with
the
contract
renewal
problem
in
mind
for
one
of
the
inclusions
in
that
definition
is,
specifically,
the
no
contract-no
work
strike
which
mr.
john
l.
lewis
made
famous
several
years
before
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
that's
further
made
clear
by
section
502
which
follows
it,
which
excludes
safety
strikes
as
rather
narrowly
defined.
they
define
a
safety
strike
as
a
strike
occurring
by
reason
of
the
immediate
presence
of
danger
at
the
status
of
the
operation.
so
that,
we
know
that
congress,
when
it
was
dealing
with
this
problem,
had
fully
in
mind
the
problem
of
whether
they
wanted
to
exclude
strikes
on
a
qualitative
basis
or
on
a
temporal
basis.
let's
return
again
to
the
provisions
of
the
specific
loss-of-status
clause.
any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike
within
the
60-day
period.
now,
that
is
clearly
a
temporal
standard
of
conduct.
there
is
nothing
qualitative
about
it
at
all.
it's
measured
exclusively
as
a
period
of
time.
now,
did
congress
mean
that?
we
have
some
evidence
that
it
did.
the
language
of
the
loss-of-status
clause
came
out
of
the
senate
version
of
the
bill,
s.1126.
as
it
originally
appeared
in
that
bill,
the
loss-of-status
clause
didn't
say
within
the
60-day
period.
it
said
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
60-day
period.
that
version
of
the
bill
obtained
through
the
initial
report
and
through
its
inclusion
by
the
senate
in
the
bill
which
went
to
conference,
and
it
was
changed
only
by
the
conference
committee.
now,
we
have
further
evidence
along
the
same
line.
every
reference
to
this
in
the
commissioner
--
in
the
committee
reports,
and
there
are
only
two
of
them,
i
have
collated
them
in
an
appendix
to
the
reply
brief,
refers
exclusively
to
a
temporal
basis.
there
is
no
suggestion
anywhere
that
a
qualitative
measure
of
conduct
was
intended
by
congress,
all
quantitative
temporal,
within
the
60-day
period.
now,
at
this
point,
you'd
have
to
assume,
if
you
wanted
to
follow
the
board
construction,
that
congress
made
at
least
three
independent
language
errors.
now,
the
assumption
that
congress
made
three
independent
language
errors
in
a
very
short
sentence
is
rather
farfetched.
and,
i
think
if
we
will
examine
this
section
further,
we'll
see
that
congress
was
not
erring
at
all,
but
congress
was
dealing
with
a
separate
facet
of
the
renegotiation
problem.
let's
go
on
with
the
wording,
any
employee
who
engages
on
a
strike
within
the
60-day
period
specified
in
this
subsection
shall
lose
his
status
as
an
employee
of
the
employer
engaged
in
the
particular
labor
dispute
for
the
purposes
of
sections
8,
9,
and
10
of
this
act.
now,
your
honors
will
notice
that
there
is
no
condemnation
of
the
conduct
of
the
person
who
strikes
within
this
60-day
period.
this
loss-of-status
clause
does
not
say
that
a
strike
within
the
60-day
period
is
unlawful.
it
doesn't
attempt
to
characterize
the
conduct
to
say
that,
just
because
you
strike
within
the
60-day
period,
you
are
committing
a
misdemeanor
or
some
sort
rather
or
you
are
--
you
are
committing
conduct
which
should
be
punished.
it
doesn't
say
anything
of
that
sort.
it
deals
solely
with
the
status
of
the
employee
under
the
remedial
sections
of
the
act,
those
are
sections
8,
9,
and
10.
it
says,
nothing
whatever
about
his
status
under
section
7
of
the
act,
which
is
the
substantive
section
giving
him
the
right
to
organize
and
bargain
collectively
and
to
engage
in
other
concerted
activities.
it
leaves
that
section
--
his
rights
under
that
section
complete.
of
course,
a
certain
number
of
men,
to
a
certain
degree
--
to
a
certain
extent
and
to
a
certain
degree,
they
are
unenforceable
because
the
remedial
sections
8,
9,
and
10
are
being
denied
to
him
by
this
section.
now,
what
is
the
significance
of
that
selective
language?
let's
take
section
9.
he's
barred
from
his
rights
under
section
9.
that
means
that
he
can't
be
a
protagonist
in
a
representation
proceeding
brought
before
the
board.
he
can't
be
a
voter
in
its
elections.
he
can't
be
a
respond
--
a
party
respondent
to
a
proceeding
bought
--
brought
by
another.
he's
completely
divorced
from
a
representation
proceeding.
it's
the
literal
language
of
this
before
us.
now,
why
should
that
be
so?
unless
congress
had
contemplated
that
organizational
difficulties,
representation
questions,
might
be
pending
at
or
about
the
time
of
contract
renewal.
congress
knew
that
very
well.
congress,
in
enacting
this
situation
or
enacting
this
whole
section
allowing
60
days
for
renegotiation,
was
quite
cognizant
of
the
contract
bar
doctrine
of
the
board
which
permitted
questions
from
being
--
representation
questions
from
being
raised
until
pretty
near
the
60th
day
prior
to
the
expiration
of
a
contract.
it
knew
that
representation
proceedings
would
be
pending
during,
rather,
in
a
certain
number
of
the
cases
which
would
fall
under
this
section
of
the
act.
therefore,
we
may
infer
that
congress
had
in
mind
denying
a
striker
who
went
out
on
a
recognition
strike,
a
status
in
the
type
of
proceeding
which
a
recognition
--
which
a
representation
proceeding
would
be
designed
to
circumvent.
all
right,
that's
section
9.
now,
they
bar
him
also
from
section
8.
section
8
is
the
section
which
defines
what
an
unfair
labor
practice
is.
under
the
old
wagner
act,
it
was
unilateral
in
finding
the
employer
only.
today,
it's
bilateral.
why
does
the
congress
bar
an
employee
from
access
to
section
8?
unless
it
presupposes
that
he
has
been
the
victim
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
that
he
will
be
the
victim
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
very
relief
that
it
denies
to
it
is
the
relief
that
he
would
need
when,
and
only
when,
he
had
been
ousted
from
his
job,
demoted,
or
been
the
victim
of
some
other
discrimination
where
he
would
need
the
board
to
lift
him
up
again
and
reinstate
him
in
his
former
place.
now,
of
course,
we
also
have
section
10.
section
10
is
the
procedural
section.
that's
the
section
under
which
he
goes
to
the
board,
files
a
charge,
the
board
issues
a
complaint,
has
a
hearing,
makes
a
finding,
issues,
and
order.
now,
there
is
no
point
to
putting
in
a
denial
of
relief
under
section
10,
unless
the
board
was
aiming
at
the
unfair
labor
practice
at
--
at
knocking
out
the
employee's
--
the
strikers'
access
for
unfair
labor
practices
which
had
been
committed
prior
to
the
strike
and
which
were
pending
undetermined
before
the
man
hit
the
breaks,
as
the
saying
goes.
section
10
appears
to
have
been
put
there
precisely
to
block
the
contention
that
the
loss-of-status
clause
does
not
apply
to
antecedent
unfair
labor
practices.
what
congress
has
done
under
this
section
--
your
--
your
honors
will
further
notice
that
the
concluding
words
of
the
section
restore
the
man's
loss-of-status
immediately
upon
reemployment.
now,
let
me
equate
what
congress
has
done
here
to
the
notion
that
we
have
in
other
fields
of
law
of
an
election
of
remedies.
congress
hasn't
said
this
conduct
of
striking
is
wrong.
it
merely
says
“we
buy
your
remedy.”
you
have
a
choice.
you
may
have
a
remedy
by
strike
or
you
may
have
a
remedy
by
the
processes
of
the
board,
but
you
cannot
have
both
in
these
circumstances.
if
you
think
that
a
strike
is
an
efficacious
remedy
for
your
problem,
you
may
go
ahead
and
strike.
we
don't
condemn
your
action.
we
say
not
a
word
about
it
being
unlawful.
we
don't
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice.
nobody
consents
you,
but
you
can't
go
to
the
board.
you
can't
ride
the
two
horses
at
once.
if
your
strike
interferes
with
renegotiation,
however,
and
you
have
--
and
your
strike
was
the
wrong
remedy,
we
will
leave
you
precisely
where
we
found
you.
we
will
not,
again,
put
you
in
a
position
to
resort
to
the
remedy
which
you
thought
was
so
slow
or
inefficacious
that
you
disregarded
it
in
favor
of
a
strike.
in
other
words,
you
may
follow
the
ways
of
peace
and,
if
you
do,
you
have
your
full
rights
before
the
board.
on
the
other
hand,
you
may
disrupt
negotiation.
and,
that
refers
not
only
to
the
incumbent
bargaining
union,
but
to
the
contesters,
to
the
other
unions,
to
political
factions
within
the
incumbent
union,
to
anyone
who,
for
his
own
designs
and
for
his
own
purposes,
whether
or
not
those
designs
and
purposes
accord
with
those
of
the
incumbent
union,
loses
the
remedy.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it
would
have
its
choice.
still
it
--
it
would
still
have
its
choice
between
the
strike
and
the
board
remedy.
the
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
the
--
your
statement
--
your
honor's
statement,
of
course
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
unfair
labor
practices
or
the
both
of
them
because
they
brought
them
in
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
after
the
service
of
the
notice.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that's
right.
if
they
--
they
have
the
election
to
strike
or
to
accept
the
board
remedy.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
oh
no,
sir.
i
--
you
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
misunderstood
me
then.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
oh
i
--
i
see
what
you
mean.
no,
you
did
not
misunderstand
me.
before
this
notice
is
given,
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
may
be
remedied
by
the
board.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
and,
it
may
also
exist
as
a
strike.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
the
union
has
the
full
panoply
of
war
material,
shall
we
say.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it
has
two
lawful
choices
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
prior
to
the
service
of
the
notice.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
well,
it
--
it
has
--
it
still
has
its
election.
but,
now,
its
election
is
conditioned
on
a
forfeiture
of
its
right
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
to
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
yes
--
no,
its
choice
now
becomes
restricted.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it
cannot
do
both.
it
may
resort
to
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
only
to
the
board,
if
it
wishes
to
resort
to
the
board.
if
it
resorts
to
the
strike,
it
may
not
thereafter
resort
to
the
board.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
let
us
--
let
me
make
this
observation
in
answer
to
that.
there
is
distinct
evidence
that
this
is
one
of
two
sections
of
the
taft-hartley
act
which
was
enacted
not
for
the
protection
of
the
employer,
nor
for
the
protection
of
the
employee,
nor
for
the
protection
of
the
union,
but
for
the
protection
of
the
public.
senator
ball,
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
act
that's
admitted
by
opposition,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
originally
lean
on
him,
said
--
identified
this
as
one
of
two
such
provisions,
the
other
one
being
the
national
emergency
provision.
now,
from
that
view
point,
what
is
congress
interested
in?
congress
is
interested
in
a
smooth
renegotiation
of
contracts.
it's
not
taking
the
narrow
view
of
equity
between
employer
and
employee,
or
between
union
and
employee.
it's
taken
the
view
point
that
all
interfering
strikes
should
be
controlled
during
this
period.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that
is
so,
sir,
but
this
is
a
specific
application
of
it.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
think
--
i
think
that
congress
had
a
bit
more
confidence
in
the
board
than
your
honor's
question
implies.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
that
is
right,
sir,
but
this
court
has,
only
within
the
last
term
and
i
think
on
two
occasions,
rather
than
one,
rejected
a
rather
well
founded
argument
that
was
brought
up
based
upon
jurisdiction
acquired
as
a
result
of
the
procedural
delays
of
some
other
body.
if
i
recall
the
garner
case,
they
came
up
here
with
one
of
the
judges
of
the
pennsylvania
court
thinking
that
the
garner
brothers
had
no
adequate
remedy
by
reason
of
the
length
of
time
that
it
took
a
proceeding
to
go
through
the
various
stages
which
such
a
proceeding
goes
through
with
the
board
which,
incidentally,
were
about
the
same
as
they
are
here,
i
believe.
this
court,
in
deciding
the
garner
case,
didn't
even
take
notice
of
that
objection.
and,
i
think,
rather
recently,
i
don't
recall
the
case
you
have.
we
objected
the
argument
expressly,
as
it
was
presented
in
another
case.
it
might
have
been
the
western
council,
although
i'm
not
quite
sure
now.
let
me
reemphasize,
in
the
minute
or
two
that
i
have
remaining,
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
here
was,
as
your
honor
put
it,
industrial
peace
during
this
renegotiation
period
which
is
a
critical
period.
now,
you
do
not
achieve
industrial
peace
simply
by
commanding
two
people
to
bargain.
you
must
do
more
than
that.
you
must
prevent
any
interfering
force
which
may
be
applied.
if
a
third-party,
not
a
party
to
the
contract
at
all,
comes
in
and
says,
“we
want
something
else
than
is
being
bargained
for.
we
will
strike
together,”
the
actions
of
that
party
must
be
controlled.
how
can
the
parties
who
are
suppose
to
bargain
continue
to
bargain
if
the
plants
about
which
they
are
bargaining
are
on
strike
for
any
reason?
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
let
me
remind
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
your
honor
that
a
union,
as
such,
has
no
rights
under
this
act.
what
acts
--
what
rights
it
has
under
the
theory
of
this
act
in
its
predecessor
and
of
the
railway
labor
act
are
not
the
rights
of
the
union
but
the
right
of
the
employee.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
they
are
completely
derivative
and
dependent
upon
their
existence.
rather,
they
depend
completely
upon
the
will
of
the
individual
employee.
now,
the
will
of
the
individual
employee
may
quite
--
may
well,
it
is
true,
be
swayed
even
by
an
employer
today,
strange
as
that
may
seem.
but,
congress,
in
enacting
this
act,
it
seems
to
me,
decided
to
subordinate
certain
of
the
protections
and
its
right
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
enactment
which
it
had
previously
given
in
order
to
achieve
industrial
peace
during
the
critical
time
of
renegotiation.
and,
i
think
that
the
breath
of
this
language
we
have
before
us
today
completely
supports
such
a
purpose
on
the
part
of
congress.
i
see
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
to
my
--
rest
of
my
argument.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
well,
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
cover
the
--
i'd
--
i'd
sooner
hold
that
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
can't
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
--
possibly
cover
the
contract
points
in
five
minutes.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
i
can't
add
very
much
to
what
mr.
manoli
said
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
bill
was
originally
reported,
the
language
originally
appeared
in
s.1126
as
it
was
reported
by
the
senate
committee
on
education
and
labor
to
the
body.
in
that
form,
it
was
a
second
proviso
clause,
that
is,
the
section
first
to
find
what
collective
bargaining
was
generally.
then,
it
says
“provided
that
where
there
is
a
contract,
these
obligations
follow,”
and
then,
at
the
tail
end,
in
the
same
position
that
it
is
now,
it
said
“provided,
further,
that
any
employee
who
strikes
during
this
period
shall
fall
from
the
status,”
using
substantially
the
words
of
their
mouth.
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
as
it
was
report
--
mr.
bernard
h.
fitzpatrick
it
was
offered
in
the
senate
by
--
it
was
a
committee
bill
as
originally
offered
in
the
senate.
i
do
not
know
whether
it
appeared
in
any
of
the
antecedent
bills
which
went
into
the
makeup
of
1126.
i
would
like
also
to
comment
a
moment
on,
perhaps
a
little
differing
concept
evoked
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
to
mr.
manoli,
concerning
the
relationship
between
the
contract
issue
and
the
loss
of
status
issue.
i
would
think
that
the
logical
way
for
this
court
to
approach
the
problem
would
be
to
consider,
first,
the
loss
of
status
issue
because,
apparently,
that
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
if
there
are
no
employees,
the
board
has
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
proceeding,
and
the
effect
of
this
loss
of
status
clause
is
to
rob
these
men
of
whatever
status
they
had
as
employees.
i
would
think
that
it
was
rather
an
absurdity
to
have
the
national
labor
relations
board
conduct
a
proceeding
to
determine
whether
there
were
unfair
labor
practices
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
there
were
unfair
labor
practices.
i
would
like
to
say,
further,
concerning
my
little
passages
arms
with
the
chief
justice,
that
the
arguments
used
by
the
chief
justice
were
the
arguments
used
in
some
part
by
the
minority
in
attacking
this
piece
of
legislation
in
both
houses.
i
am
told
by
my
opponents
that
the
use
of
minority
members
are
no
criterion
of
what
the
intent
of
the
legislation
is.
i
merely
mention
that.
i
think
it
was
appropriate
that
those
arguments
were
used
on
the
other
side
of
the
street.
i
think
it
has
no
bearing,
perhaps,
as
they
say,
on
the
construction
of
the
statute
that
such
arguments
exist.
one
other
thing,
again
adverting
to
a
notion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's,
expressed
in
the
questioning
is
the
odd
mixture
of
motivations
which
the
board
must
unravel
in
any
one
of
these
cases.
now,
ordinarily,
when
you
think
of
unfair
labor
practices
in
this
connotation,
you
think
of
somebody
being
fired
over
an
issue
of
discrimination,
and
that's
the
simply
way.
but,
it
isn't
always
the
simple
way
in
which
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
occurs
because
one
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
is
refusal
to
bargain.
let
us
say,
the
fact
situation
--
the
fact
situation
based
on
england
--
on
inland
steel
case
is
assumed.
there,
the
union
came
in
and
asked
for
a
pension.
the
employer
said,
“well,
we
will
bargain
with
you
on
all
other
demands
but
we
will
not
bargain
with
you
on
your
pension.
we
think
that
is
not
a
bargainable
issue.
we're
not
required
to
bargain
under
it.”
