you
may
proceed,
mr.
fitzpatrick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
court
find?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
did
the
board
find?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
admit
the
other
findings,
why
do
you
say
you
can't
challenge
the
other
finding
on
this
level?
how
could
you
challenge
that
finding
on
this
level?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
absolute
scientific
meaning
of
“cause”
in
that
connection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
employees
ever
seek
reinstatement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
--
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask,
under
your
interpretation
of
this
section
that
you've
just
read,
8
--
8
(4)(d),
is
there
any
penalty
on
the
employer
comparable
to
the
loss-of-status
that
--
that
runs
to
the
employee
in
the
event
he
breaches
his
contract
during
that
period
and
leaves
the
employees
in
peril?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
happens
to
the
employee
who
is
fired
during
this
period
for
union
activity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
am
talking
about
the
first
fellow
that
was
fired.
the
one
who
--
whose
firing
precipitated
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
strike.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i
mean,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
remedy
--
what
remedy
does
that
man
have?
assume
there
isn't
--
there
wasn't
going
to
be
any
strike.
suppose
he
was
just
fired
for
--
for
union
activity
during
this
interim
when
you
say
the
union
is
prohibited
by
the
law
from
striking.
does
he
have
any
remedy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
his
remedy
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
would
that
take
him
normally?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
ever
take
less?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fitzpatrick,
to
take
the
law
in
that
same
spirit
that
you
have
--
have
just
annunciated
it.
suppose
that
the
union
gave
notice
to
try
to
get
a
modification
of
its
contracts.
suppose,
prior
to
that
time,
there
had
been
no
unfair
labor
practices
on
the
part
of
the
employer,
but
suppose
he
waited
until
after
that
notice
had
been
given
and,
then,
did
the
same
things
that
the
board
found
he
was
guilty
of
here.
what
choice
would
the
union
have
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
mean
that
it
must
forfeit
status
if
they
--
if
they
do
strike.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
--
that,
before
the
union
gave
notice,
it
could
either,
without
subjecting
itself
to
forfeiture
of
status
of
employees,
strike
or
it
could
go
to
the
board.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that,
after
it
had
give
a
notice,
it
could
only
do
the
one.
it
could
only
go
to
the
board.
did
i
misunderstand
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it
has
two
lawful
choices.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
my
point
is
this.
after
--
after
it
has
given
notice
of
an
intention
to
work
for
modification
or
change
in
its
contract
in
good
faith,
the
employer
commences
unfair
practices
acts,
such
as
were
found
in
this
case,
and
which
it
permitted
to
continue
during
this
period
of
two
months
would
divest
the
union
of
all
of
its
membership.
does
it,
then,
have
any
lawful
choices
or
must
it
wait,
must
it
file
only
with
the
board
and
then
wait
all
the
months
that
are
necessary
in
order
get
a
ruling
on
unfair
practices?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
two
lawful
choices,
as
it
had
before.
that's
what
i
was
asking.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
have
a
strike
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
sound
like
a
fair
and
equitable
interpretation
to
give,
unless
you
have
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
you
think
we
might
divine
a
little
broader
purpose
of
congress
and
say
the
purpose
was
industrial
peace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
--
do
you
think
it
--
it
means
for
industrial
peace
to
tie
the
hands
of
one
party
and
let
the
other
party
do
what
it
--
what
it
wishes
to
the
destruction
of
the
other
party?
does
that
--
does
that
ultimately
result
in
industrial
peace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
talking
about
these
things
were
all
on
a
temporal
basis
and
--
and
there
is
a
--
a
time
factor,
is
there
not,
and
a
very
serious
one
in
a
--
in
an
employee
or
--
or
a
union
or
an
employer
going
before
the
--
the
labor
relations
board
for
unfair
labor
practices?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
the
--
how
can
a
union
continue
to
bargain
if
the
employer
takes
--
takes
all
of
his
members
away
from
him
by
unfair
practices
act
while
he's
sitting
at
the
table?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
long
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
has
rights
as
a
bargaining
agent,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
yes,
you
have
five
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that
--
that's
all
right.
you're
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
certainly
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
may
do
that.
that's
all
right.
mr.
manoli
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
manoli,
may
i
ask.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
would
the
--
when
would
the
contract
then
terminated
in
the
court?
what
would
determine
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
november
20
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
pardon
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
namely,
for
economic
purposes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fitzpatrick.
