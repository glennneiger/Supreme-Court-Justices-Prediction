mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
the
net
of
mr.
fitzpatrick's
argument,
seems
to
me,
is
--
and
when
i
speak
of
his
argument,
i'm
also
including
matters
attached
on
in
the
brief
but
not
in
the
course
of
mr.
fitzpatrick's
oral
argument.
the
net
of
his
argument,
it
seems
to
us,
is
that
the
no-strike
clause
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract
between
the
parties
and
section
8
(d)
of
the
act,
in
effect,
licensed
the
employer
to
engage
in
the
most
serious,
the
most
provocative
type
of
unfair
labor
practices
during
the
life
of
the
contract
or
during
the
so-called
waiting
period
prescribed
by
section
8
(d)
without
risking
a
lawful
strike
on
the
part
of
the
employees
to
protest
that
kind
of
action.
now,
the
board
and
the
two
court
of
appeals
which
have
passed
upon
this
issue,
namely,
the
court
below
and
the
seventh
circuit,
have
held
that
neither
the
no-strike
clause
nor
section
8
(d)
of
the
act
confer
such
a
license
upon
the
employer.
before
i
come
to
discussing
these
two
questions
in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
important
to
an
understanding
of
this
case
to
focus
attention
upon
the
setting
in
which
the
two
questions
arise.
i'm
not
sure
if
they've
been
--
that
the
setting
has
been
completely
covered
by
mr.
fitzpatrick's
opening
argument.
as
mr.
fitzpatrick
said,
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
here
between
the
company,
the
petitioners,
and
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
employers
which,
for
purposes
of
simplicity,
i
shall
call
the
“carpenters.”
that
contract
was
about
to
expire
sometime
late
in
november
and,
because
it
was
about
to
expire,
it
would
make
possible
a
redetermination
of
the
employees'
bargaining
representatives.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
of
that
possibility,
local
65
had
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
asking,
in
effect,
the
board
to
hold
an
election
upon
the
expiration
of
the
contract
to
the
then
current
contract
to
re-determine
the
employer's
choice
of
bargaining
representatives.
the
company
was
strongly
opposed
to
local
65.
at
the
same
time,
it
felt
that
the
incumbent
union,
the
carpenters,
could
not
successfully
oppose
local
65.
the
company
felt,
however,
that
a
third
union,
which
i
shall
call
the
“paper
workers,”
could
oppose
successfully
the
organizing
efforts
of
local
65.
and,
accordingly,
the
company
concluded
to
give
the
paper
workers
assistance
in
succeeding
the
carpenters
as
the
employers
bargaining
representatives
upon
the
expiration
of
the
contract.
to
that
end,
the
employer,
as
the
record
demonstrates,
engaged
in
a
course
of
conduct
which
was
designed
to
coerce
the
employees
to
dissert
the
incumbent
union,
the
carpenters,
and
to
insure
the
succession
of
the
paper
workers
as
their
bargaining
representatives
upon
the
expiration
of
the
existing
contract.
and,
to
this
end,
the
company
here
gave
of
its
time,
its
money,
and
its
effort
assisting
the
paper
workers
in
organizing
the
employees.
and,
indeed,
the
company
went
even
beyond
that
because
the
company
worked
with
employees
with
economic
reprisals
if
they
did
not
join
the
favored
union
and
promised
those
--
and
promised
--
and
also
promised
the
employees
with
economic
benefits
if
they
did
join
the
union
favored
by
the
--
by
the
employer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
the
notice
to
my
private
contract
was
given
by
the
union
on
october
10th,
1950.
the
paper
workers,
begun
to
organize
the
employees
on
october
20th
and
by
october
23rd
and,
during
those
three
--
period
of
three
days,
the
employer
engaged
in
these
unfair
labor
practices
which
i
have
summarized.
during
those
three
days,
between
october
20
and
23rd,
the
employer
engaged
in
these
unfair
labor
practices.
and
by
october
23rd,
the
employees
subjected
this
type
of
pressure,
as
would
be
expected,
joined
the
favored
union.
now,
upon
reflection,
however,
a
substantial
number
--
well,
when
i
say
joined
the
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
on
november
20th.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
november
20,
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
nothing.
no,
no
suggestion
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
evidence
indicates,
as
i
have
sought
to
summarize,
that
the
employer
assisted
the
union
in
trying
to
organize
its
employees
because
it
feared
that
the
incumbent
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
but
not
a
company
union,
no,
not
in
--
not
a
company
union.
as
i
tell
--
i
say,
a
company-assisted
union
in
this
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
particular
purpose.
the
--
as
i
was
saying,
a
majority
of
employees
subjected
to
these
pressures
by
the
employer
signed
application
cards
for
membership
in
the
paper
workers
union.
upon
reflection,
however,
though,
a
substantial
number
of
these
employees
revoked
this
application
membership
cards
and
reaffirmed
their
allegiance
to
the
incumbent
union,
the
carpenters.
now,
one
of
the
leading
opponents
of
the
paper
workers
union
and,
by
paper
workers,
i
mean
the
union
favored
by
the
employer,
one
of
the
leading
opponents
was
an
employee
named
ciccone.
on
november
13th,
the
company
climaxed
its
support
of
the
paper
workers
and
its
opposition
to
the
incumbent
union
by
discharging
ciccone
on
a
very
flimsy
pretext
but,
obviously,
because
he
was
opposed
to
the
paper
workers
which
ciccone
termed
as
the
boss'
union.
when
ciccone
was
discharged,
his
fellow
employees
in
machine
shop
walked
out
and
when
representatives
of
the
company
threatened
other
employees
with
similar
reprisals
if
they
failed
to
join
in
the
favored
union,
the
upshot
was
that
all
the
employers
walked
out.
now,
the
record
is
clear
and
the
board
and
the
court
below
so
found
that
although
the
incumbent
union
had
given
notice
to
modify
the
contract,
the
record
is
clear,
nevertheless,
that
the
strike,
although
triggered
by
ciccone's
discharge,
was
caused
fundamentally
by
the
employer's
efforts
over
a
period
of
time
to
destroy
the
employee's
choice
in
the
--
in
the
selection
of
their
bargain
representatives
and
to
unseat
the
incumbent
collective
bar
--
the
incumbent
bargaining
representative
upon
the
expiration
of
its
contract
and
to
substitute
in
its
place
the
favored
paper
workers
union.
now,
that
brings
us,
i
think,
to
the
fresh
old
question
in
this
case
in
which,
unfortunately,
mr.
fitzpatrick,
because
of
lack
of
time,
wasn't
able
to
touch
upon
but,
nevertheless,
i
do
think
we
have
to
consider
it
because
it
is
a
threshold
question.
if
this
question
should
be
resolved
against
the
board,
the
court
would
have
no
occasion
to
reach
the
interpretation
of
section
8
(d).
the
no-strike
clause
in
this
contract
is
cast
in
a
somewhat
comprehensive
terms.
it
includes
--
it
says,
in
so
many
words,
that
the
union
shall
not
engage
in
any
strike
or
work
stoppage.
nevertheless,
we
think
that,
despite
the
comprehensive
language
of
the
clause,
it
may
not
fairly
be
read
in
isolation.after
all,
the
no-strike
clause
is
part
of
the
bargain
which
the
employer
and
the
union
have
struck.
and,
because
it
is
only
part
of
that
bargain,
it
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
entire
bargain
which
a
--
which
two
parties
have
reached
and
which
they
have
incorporator
in
their
contract.
now,
obviously,
the
no-strike
commitment
which
the
union
gives
is
a
prize
or
a
quid
pro
quo
which
is
--
it
is
willing
to
pay
in
exchange
for
a
contract
covering
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
in
this
particular
case,
the
union
has
obtained
a
contract
establishing
the
substantive
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
and,
by
the
no-strike
clause,
by
the
no-strike
commitment,
it
agrees
that,
during
the
life
of
contract,
it
will
not
engage
in
a
strike
to
compel
a
modification
or
termination
of
the
agreed
terms.
likewise,
this
particular
contract
sets
up
a
grievance
and
an
arbitration
procedure.
and,
under
this
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure,
the
disputes
which
arise
between
the
parties
in
the
course
of
their
normal
relationships
under
their
--
under
the
contract
and
disputes
which
arise
between
the
parties
with
the
respect
of
the
meaning
or
application
of
the
--
of
the
contract,
these
disputes
are
to
be
submitted
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures
established
by
the
contract.
now,
in
establishing
this
procedure,
we
think
that
the
parties
have
implicitly
agreed
that,
to
the
extent
that
these
procedures
are
available,
namely,
to
the
extent
that
these
procedures
are
available
for
resolving
whatever
disputes
may
arise
between
the
parties
respecting
their
normal
relationships
under
the
contract,
to
that
extent,
the
parties
have
agreed
by
virtue
of
the
no-lockout
--
the
no-lockout
and
no-strike
clause,
the
parties
have
agreed
to
refrain
from
self-help
with
respect
to
disputes
of
that
character.
and,
by
the
no-strike
clause,
the
union
has,
in
effect,
given
a
solemn
commitment
that,
with
respect
to
these
matters
which
may
be
properly
referred
to
the
arbitration
and
grievance
procedures
and
with
respect
to
which
the
contract
has
made
--
has
provided
an
ordinary
procedure
for
the
resolution
of
such
disputes,
to
that
extent,
the
union
has
agreed
to
forego
the
right
to
strike.
the
commitment,
i
believe,
does
not
go
beyond
that.
i
think,
perhaps,
that
no
one
had
a
greater
insight
in
these
matters
than
the
late
dean
harry
shulman
of
yale
university.
as
the
court
undoubtedly
knows,
dean
shulman
served
as
the
permanent
arbitrator
under
the
fourth
contract
with
united
auto
workers
and,
in
the
course
of
his
duties,
he
had
occasion
to
comment
on
the
scope
in
the
breath
of
a
no-strike
clause,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
here.
he
said,
this
is
quoted
at
page
30
of
our
brief,
“now,
the
whole
procedure
of
a
grievance
procedure
with
a
terminable
step
of
arbitration
is
to
substitute
that
method
of
adjustment
for
strikes,
lockouts,
and
similar
measures
of
self-help.
the
very
provision
of
a
grievance
procedure,
have
an
umpire
whose
decisions
are
final
means
that
there
must
be
no-strikes
on
matter
--
on
matters
within
his
jurisdiction
or
for
the
objective
of
avoiding
the
effects
of
his
decision.
section
1,
that
refers
to
the
no-strike
clause
in
the
fourth
contract,
section
1
merely
makes
that
meaning
expressed.
that,
in
substance,
your
honor,
is
our
position
on
the
no-strike
clause.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
he's
referring
the
no-strike
clause
in
section
1
of
the
fourth
contract.
there
are
additional
arguments
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
which
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
it
refers
to
the
provision
of
the
contract
--
of
the
fourth
contract.
that
--
that
provision
had
a
no-strike
clause.
there
are
other
arguments
in
connection
with
the
no-strike
clause
that
are
made
in
the
briefs
or
the
parties
but
i
think
i
will
not
undertake
to
take
the
court's
time
in
going
into
the
subsidiary
arguments
at
length.
i
do
--
i
turn
now
to
what,
perhaps,
is
the
more
important
question
in
this
case
and,
that
is,
whether
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
--
if
the
strike
is
not
in
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause
in
the
contract,
the
question
nevertheless
remains
whether
the
strike
is
in
violation
of
the
section
8
(d).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true.
is
--
it
is
not
in
violation
--
it's
not
in
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
they
may
lose
their
status
though,
however,
if
the
strike
is
covered
by
section
8
(d)
and
they
have
not
complied
with
the
particular
provisions
prescribed
by
section
8
(d).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
let's
assume,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
strike
--
that
the
contract
did
not
have
a
no-strikes
clause
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
in
this.
if
they
went
out
on
strike,
the
strike
would
not
be
in
breach
of
any
commitment
in
the
contract,
and
the
sands
case
in
where
the
--
it
would
not
apply.
however,
though,
there
still
remains
the
question
whether
if
such
a
--
a
strike
of
this
kind
is
covered
by
section
8
(d),
the
question
remains
whether
the
employees
have
followed
the
prescribed
procedure.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
so,
you
do
have
to
come
to
the
second
question
even
though
there's
a
--
even
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
we
take
the
position
that
they
don't
infringe
any
part
of
it
in
this
particular
case,
but
the
argument
on
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
no-strike
--
the
no-strike
is
out
and,
then,
they
come
to
section
8
(d)
and
they
say
it
does
apply
to
this
kind
of
strike
under
section
8
(d)
does
and,
since
the
employers
failed
or
the
union
failed
to
take
the
appropriate
steps
since
they
have
failed
to
wait
the
proscribed
length
of
time,
they
will
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
mr.
fitzpatrick's
argument
in
connection
with
section
8
(d),
it
seems
to
me,
is
largely
founded
upon
isolating
the
last
sentence
of
that
section
and,
upon
it
--
upon
the
basis
of
that
i
--
of
isolating
that
last
sentence
from
the
rest
of
the
section
concluding
that,
in
section
8
(d),
congress
meant
to
reach
any
type
of
strike,
whatever
its
cause,
whatever
its
purpose.
i
hardly
need
to
say
i
--
that
this
is
not
the
way
to
read
the
statute.
we
must
look
to
the
section
as
a
whole.
and,
i
think
that
when
we
look
to
the
section
as
a
whole
and
bear
in
mind
the
legislative
purpose
which
is
behind
section
8
(d),
that
i
think
it
becomes
fairly
evident
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
section
8
(d)
were
strikes
in
support
of
contract
demands
during
this
crucial
renegotiation
period.
the
whole
of
the
section
and
each
of
the
steps
which
it
prescribes
are
geared
to
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
to
renegotiation
of
contracts.
as
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
obligation
which
the
statute
imposes
upon
both
employers
and
unions
alike,
it
--
it
provides
that
whenever
a
party
to
a
collective
bargain
agreement
desires
to
terminate
or
modify
it,
that
party
shall
take
several
steps.
and,
notice,
i
--
i
will
not
to
read
this
but
when
your
honors
come
to
read
this
particular
section,
you
will
notice
better
than
i
can
convey
to
you
by
words
how
closely
all
these
steps
are
geared
to
the
collective
bargaining
process.
one,
it
requires
that
the
--
the
party
seeking
to
terminate
or
modify
the
contract
shall
give
at
least
60-day
notice
prior
to
termination
of
its
desire
to
modify
or
terminate
the
contract.
two,
it
requires
that
party
to
offer
to
meet
with
the
other
party
for
the
purpose
of
renegotiating
a
successor
--
a
successor
or
modified
contract.
three,
it
requires
the
parties,
in
case
they
arrive
at
a
dispute
in
the
course
of
their
negotiations,
it
requires
them
to
notify
the
conciliation
services
and
their
--
and
invoke
their
assistance.
fourth,
it
requires
that
neither
party
shall
resort
to
strike
or
lockup
and
shall
keep
the
contract
in
full-force
and
effect
for
a
period
of
60
days
following
the
notice
or
until
the
expiration
of
the
contract,
whichever
is
later.
the
section
further
provides
that
neither
party
is
required
to
discuss
or
to
agree
to
any
modification
of
the
contract
terms
prior
to
the
time
when
the
contract,
by
its
own
terms,
permits
a
reopening.
and,
finally,
the
section
closes
with
the
statement
that
any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike,
this
is
important
i
believe
and
i'd
like
to
read
it,
that
any
employee
who
engages
in
a
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
--
the
whole
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
is
at
pages
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i'm
going
to
--
i'm
giving
it
to
you
in
just
a
second.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
statute
is
pages
64
to
65
of
our
brief.
now,
i
am
reading
at
the
bottom
of
65
and
going
over
to
66.
that's
the
concluding
sentence
of
action
--
section
8
(d)
and
that
reads
that
“any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike
within
the
60-day
period
specified
in
this
subsection
shall
lose
his
status
as
an
employee
of
the
employer
engaged
in
particular
labor
dispute
for
the
purposes
of
the
sections
8,
9,
and
10
of
this
act
as
amended.
but,
such
loss
of
status
for
such
employee
shall
terminate
if
and
when
he
is
reemployed
by
such
employer.”
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
legislative
history?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
set
that
forth
at
pages
--
it
was
--
there
was
a
--
at
pages
--
at
pages
54
to
56
of
our
brief.
we
have
quoted
the
comments
of
senator
taft
and
also
senator
ball,
and
we've
also
set
forth
in
the
footnotes
the
statements
with
respect
to
these
provisions
in
the
senate
--
in
the
senate
and
the
house
conference
reports.
and,
if
may,
i
will
come
to
discussing
the
legislative
history
in
just
a
moment.
the
--
it
seems
to
us
that
what
congress
has
done
in
section
8
(d)
is
set
up
a
ordinary
procedure
for
the
renegotiation
of
successor
contracts.
having
set
up
that
procedure,
congress,
in
effect,
had
said
to
the
parties,
“we
have
set
up
a
procedure
whereby
you
may
negotiate
your
contract
differences
peacefully
at
the
bargaining
table.
you
must
do
--
you
must
give
this
procedure
a
chance
to
succeed.
you
must
do
it
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
if
necessary,
you
must
invoke
the
aid
of
the
federal
and
state
mediation
services.
and,
during
this
time,
while
you
are
attempting
to
iron
out
your
contract
differences,
you
must
not
to
attempt
to
substitute
force
for
persuasion
in
order
to
obtain
your
contract
demands.”
now,
that
i
--
view
of
the
section,
i
think,
is
supported
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
i've
already
called
attention
to
where
we
have
set
it
forth
in
our
brief.
during
the
course
of
the
debates
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
it's
true
of
course
that
the
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
congress
meant
to
wipeout
all
kinds
of
strikes
during
this
critical
renegotiation
period
because
strikes
of
any
kind
necessarily
disrupt
the
bargaining
negotiations.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
this
argument
gives
the
statute
a
rather
one
sided
twist
and,
in
the
absence
of
specific
language
that
congress
meant
to
require
such
a
result,
i
don't
think
we
should
impute
to
it,
and
that
is
this.
that
under
the
interpretation
of
which
mr.
fitzpatrick
gives
to
the
statute
--
the
statute,
it
would
mean
that
an
employer
could
engage
in
the
most
provocative
and
most
serious
types
of
unfair
labor
practice
which
would
have
the
most
devastating
effect
upon
the
collective
bargaining
process
and,
yet,
that
the
union
could
not
defend
itself
lawfully.
it
could
not
lawfully
defend
itself
against
those
--
that
kind
of
action,
but
that
its
the
only
remedy
would
be
to
file
charges
with
the
board.
there's
a
further
reason
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
if
the
employers
can
go
out
on
strike,
they
can
successfully
attempt
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
except
that
if
this
section
applies,
however,
and
they
go
out
on
strike,
they
automatically
lose
their
status
as
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
it's
only
if
they
have
the
economic
power
that
they
cab
compel
the
employer,
even
though
they've
lost
their
status.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
the
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
if
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
union
would
have
to
file
its
charges
and
obtain
its
remedies
from
the
board.
i
was
going
to
add
that
there's
a
further
reason
for
not
construing
this
--
this
section
the
way
that
mr.
fitzpatrick
would
construe
it,
and
that
is
this.
mr.
fitzpatrick,
in
effect,
says
what
this
section
permits
the
union
to
do
is
to
file
charges
with
the
board
and
invoke
the
administrative
remedies.
now,
congress,
during
1947
when
it
was
considering
amendments
to
the
wagner
act,
considered
two
amendments,
both
of
which
specifically
provided
that
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
resort
to
strike
action
where
the
administrative
remedy
was
available.
congress
rejected
both
of
those
amendments
and
i
think
that,
in
the
light
of
congress'
action
in
that
respect,
we
should
not
read
into
section
8
(d)
without
having
clearer
language
to
that
effect
in
this
section.
we
should
not
read
in
that
section
a
provision
that,
because
there
is
available
to
the
union
an
administrative
remedy
against
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices,
that
it
could
not
go
out
on
strike
to
protest
those
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
only
thing
is
that
if
he
engages
in
a
lockout,
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
he
engages
in
a
lockout,
of
course,
he
would
be
committing
a
violation
of
his
--
of
his
obligation
to
bargain
collectively
because
that's
one
of
the
things
that
he
may
not
do,
consistent
with
his
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
penalty
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
penalty,
no
penalty.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
he
would,
eventually,
if
he
locked
out
the
employees
and
discriminatorily
say,
eventually,
he
would
be
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
have
to
pay
whatever
loss
of
pay.
there
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
would
be
the
remedy
that
the
board
would
give
to
the
employees,
your
honor,
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
i
think
we
ought
to
take
a
look
at
the
consequences
which
flow
from
the
company's
reading
of
this
statute.
and,
i
think
that
when
we
do
take
a
look
at
the
consequences
which
flow
from
the
company's
reading
of
the
statute,
it
becomes
all
the
more
apparent
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
interpretation
and
that,
certainly,
we
should
not
impute
that
interpretation
to
congress
in
the
light
of
these
very
strange
consequences.
the
interpretation
which
the
company
imposes
upon
this
section
means
that
if
you
have
a
union
which
is
satisfied
with
its
contract,
and
therefore
is
given
no
notice
to
either
terminate
or
modify
as
required
by
this
section,
and
the
employer
in
that
situation
commits
unfair
labor
practices,
then
the
union
may
engage
in
a
lawful
strike
against
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
without
the
loss
of
employee
status
by
the
employee.
on
the
other
hand,
it
means
that
if,
as
in
this
case,
the
union
is
dissatisfied
with
its
contract
and
has
given
notice
to
modify
and
terminate
it
and
that
the
employer
then
proceeds
to
engage
in
unfair
labor
practices,
that
the
union's
hands,
as
the
chief
justice
said,
are
tied
except
by
way
of
filing
charges
with
the
board
--
with
the
board.
it
also
means
that
a
union
which
is
negotiating
its
--
a
contract
for
the
first
time
is
free
to
engage
and
is
free
to
strike
in
protest
against
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
situation
where
a
union
is
--
is
negotiating
a
second
contract
to
succeed
an
existing
one
that,
in
that
situation,
the
employer
enjoys
the
extraordinary
privilege
of
engaging
in
unfair
labor
practices
which
is
the
union
cannot
protest
by
way
--
by
way
of
a
strike.
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
these
consequences
are
so
in
congress.
that,
again,
in
the
absence
of
explicit
language
that
congress
meant
to
bring
about
such
--
such
results,
that
we
should
not
impute
a
purpose
to
do
so
on
the
basis
of
the
language
which
is
now
contained
in
section
8
(d).
i
come,
finally,
to
the
argument
which
has
been
pressed
with
this
bar,
and
that
is
that
the
specification
of
the
loss
of
status
under
sections
8,
9,
and
--
excuse
me,
under
8,
9,
and
10
which
is
set
forth
in
the
concluding
sentence
of
section
8
(d)
clearly
establishes
that
congress
meant
to
reach
unfair
labor
practice
strikers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
times
when
it
would
be
very
difficult
but,
after
all,
it's
kind
of
a
problem
that
comes
before
the
board
everyday
determining
what
is
the
motive
and,
so,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
but
i
think,
your
honor,
that,
in
the
absence
of
some
specific
legislative
history
that
this
would
--
congress
intended
to
do
and
the
absence
of
any
clear
language,
to
that
effect,
in
the
section
itself
that
even
though
congress
could
have
done
what
your
honor
suggests,
nevertheless,
we
should
not
impute
that
purpose
to
congress,
it
seems
to
me,
in
view
of
the
results,
the
very
strange
results.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
the
last
--
the
last
sentence?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
in
the
senate,
the
--
the
section
8
(d),
your
honor,
originated
in
the
senate
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
i
don't
know
off
--
i
don't
know
offhand
who
wrote
--
who
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it
was
already
--
that's
right,
it
came
out
of
the
--
it
was
already,
your
honor,
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
it
was
already
in
the
senate
provision
and,
then,
it
went
to
conference
and
the
conferees
agreed
to
it,
and
then
it
was
reported
out.
but,
there
is
no
similar
--
there
is
no
counterpart
to
this
section
in
the
house
proposal.
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
apparently,
my
colleague
informs
me
that
taft
sponsored
the
senate
--
well,
of
course,
we
know
that
he
sponsored
the
senate
bill.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
it's
been
there
from
the
beginning,
your
honor,
with
some
slight
change.
at
one
time
it
was
introduced
with
the
word
“provided
that”.
at
another
time,
the
section
read
“where
employees
go
out
on
strike
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
60
days”
and
it,
finally,
was
drafted
that
“any
employee
who
engages
in
a
strike
within
the
60-day
period.”
but,
i
believe
that
those
differences
are
unimportant
and
there's
no
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
senator
ball,
your
honor,
was
one
of
the
managers
of
the
amendments
in
the
senate,
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
he
was
simply
one
of
the
managers,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
the
amendments
in
the
senate.
apparently,
as
i
understand
that,
it
was
his
job
to
see
to
it
that
the
amendments
were
considered
and
steered
to
the
--
to
the
senate.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
was
on
that
--
he
was
on
that
committee,
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
on
that
committee.
i
cannot
answer
your
question
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is.
i
--
i
don't
know
which
particular
senator
took
credit,
if
i
may
say
so,
for
section
8
(d).
i
don't
know
if
there
is
anything
in
the
statute.
i
don't
even
--
right
now,
i
don't
recall
who
actually
offered
the
amendment
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
where
an
employer
engages
in
unfair
labor
practices,
even
though
the
union
has
given
notice
to
modify
or
terminate
the
contract
as
required
by
section
8
(d)
that,
nevertheless,
the
employees
are
free
to
go
out
on
strike
without
automatically
incurring
a
loss
of
their
employee
status.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
as
i
suggested
a
little
while
ago,
your
honor,
it's
true
that
the
employees
going
out
on
strike
may
disrupt
the
negotiations,
but
the
employer
has
already
done
the
harm.
the
employer
is
--
the
employer
is
already
engaged
in
these
--
in
these
unfair
labor
practices
and
the
harm
to
the
collective
bargaining
and
to
the
industrial
stability
are
pieces
already
been
done
by
the
employer.
and,
in
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
do
have
a
remedy,
your
honor.
but,
as
i
suggested
a
moment
ago,
the
fact
that
congress
rejected
two
amendments
which
specifically
provided
that
any
strike
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
where
an
administrative
remedy
was
available,
the
fact
that
congress
--
that
congress
rejected
those
amendments
which
specifically
so
provided
suggest
to
us
that
we
should
not
read
in
such
a
limitation
in
section
8
(d),
in
the
absence
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
didn't
get
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor,
they
could
have
--
they
could
have
said
that.
they
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but,
i
think
that
the
reason
they
were
--
your
honor,
we
must
remember,
i
think,
that
congress
was
thinking
in
terms
of
bargaining
negotiations.
it
wasn't
thinking
of
an
employer
committing
unfair
labor
practices.
it
was
thinking
in
terms
of
protecting
the
negotiations
during
this
crucial
60-day
period.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
they
provided
that
the
--
that
the
parties
should
resort
to
those
procedures
and
not
resort
to
self-help
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
other
side
to
yield
to
their
contract
demise.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor.
the
minority
report
on
the
bill
attributed
to
the
bill,
the
very
purpose
which
mr.
fitzpatrick
is
arguing
for.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
only
argument
on
the
floor
are
the
statements
that
were
made
by
senator
ball
and
senator
taft
and
--
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief.
and,
senator
--
senator
taft
said
that
section
8
(d)
was
only
concerned
with
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
senator
ball
similarly
said
that
section
8
(d)
was
designed
to
avoid
quickie
strikes
in
connection
with
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
that
it
was
designed
to
prescribe
the
safe,
as
he
put
it,
the
safe
and
sound
and
fair
procedure
that
all
the
--
that
the
majority
of
responsible
or
good
unions
now
follow.
now,
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
it's
no
part
of
the
safe,
sane,
fair,
and
sound
procedure
that
responsible
unions
follow
that,
once
they
have
given
notice
to
the
employer
of
a
desire
to
terminate
or
modify
the
contract,
they
have,
in
effect,
given
him
a
license
to
engage
in
unfair
labor
practices
without
risking
a
strike
--
without
risking
a
lawful
strike.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
senator
who?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
coming
back
to
the
--
the
senate
minority
report
that
mr.
justice
clark
has
referred
to,
i
think
the
answer,
we
--
we
must
make
to
that
as
the
answer
which
this
court
made,
speaking
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
the
schwegmann
case
that
we
look
to
the
sponsors,
not
to
the
opponents
of
the
legislation,
to
determine
its
meaning.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
we
have
--
we
have
--
first
of
all,
we
have
the
language
of
senator
taft
that
i've
referred
to,
also
the
language
of
senator
ball.
and,
senator
ball's
language,
as
one
of
the
conferees,
i
think,
is
one
of
significance
because,
as
i've
just
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
say
it
this
way,
your
honor,
that
i
think
that
if
congress
had
meant
to
cut
down
the
employer's
right,
which
is
a
fundamental
right
under
the
statutes,
to
engage
in
a
strike
in
a
--
in
protest
against
unfair
labor
practices,
that
this
would
not
have
gone
unmentioned
in
the
--
in
the
reports
of
the
majority,
on
the
house
conference
report
reporting
the
bill.
it
would
have
created,
it
seems
to
me,
such
a
very
important
and
drastic
change
in
the
employer's
fundamental
rights
under
the
act
of
the
board.
if
the
majority
had
so
indented,
they
certainly
would
have
said
something.
and,
as
a
matter
fact,
during
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
--
of
the
legislative
debate,
senator
taft,
and
you
will
discover
this,
your
honor,
when
you
come
to
read
the
whole
of
section
--
of
senator
taft's
statement
on
section
8
(d),
senator
taft
concluded
his
explanation
of
this
section
by
saying
--
by
saying
“so,
it
seems
to
me
that's
--
i
interpolate
section
8
(d)
to
be
no
real
limitation
of
the
rights
of
labor
unions.”
now,
i
submit,
your
honor,
it
would
have
been
a
very
real
limitation
upon
the
rights
of
labor
unions
if
they
--
their
right
protected
by
the
statute
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
section
8
(d).
that
section
8
(d)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
whole
section.
he's
speaking
about
the
whole
section.
i
won't
attempt
to
read
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
all
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
insofar
--
i
agree
with
--
i
agree
insofar
that
--
i
know
what
your
honor
is
getting
at.
of
course
it
does
limit
the
right
of
a
union.
normally,
under
these
situations,
the
union
would
not
be
precluded
from
going
out
on
strike
until
the
expiration
of
the
60-day
period.
now,
the
union
could
not
go
out
on
strike
during
the
life
of
a
contract
to
obtain
a
modification
or
termination
of
that
contract.
i'm
now
speaking
with
section
8
(d)
to
one
side
apart.
the
union
could
not
go
out
on
a
strike
to
compel
a
modification
or
termination
of
the
contract
during
the
life
of
the
contract
because,
under
this
court's
decision
in
sands,
if
the
employees
engage
in
such
a
strike
during
the
life
of
the
contract,
they
would
be
subject
to
losing
their
status
as
employees.
the
employer
could
discharge
them.
but,
there
is
a
period,
however.
the
waiting
period
under
section
8
(d)
goes
a
little
beyond
the
termination
of
the
contract.
it
is
either
60
days
after
notice
or
the
termination
or
expiration
of
the
contract,
whichever
is
later.
concededly,
the
60-day
notice
may
go
beyond
--
may
go
beyond
the
termination
of
the
--
or
the
expiration
date
of
the
contract.
now,
during
that
period,
without
section
8
(d),
the
employees
would
be
free
to
go
out
on
strike
without
being
subject
to
discharge
but,
now,
section
8
(d)
does
narrow
that
right
and
it
does
limit
that
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
it
doesn't
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
it
doesn't
expand
their
rights
but,
on
the
other
hand,
i
say,
your
honor,
that
we
should
not
read
into
this
section
such
a
drastic
limitation
upon
a
right
which
has
been
fundamental
and
which
has
been
recognized
throughout
the
history
of
the
wagner
act,
as
well
as
the
taft-hartley
act.
namely,
the
employee's
right
to
engage
in
strikes
to
protest
there
against
their
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
without
some
specific
explicit
language
to
that
effect
and
the
light
of
what
i
think
are
the
very
serious
consequences
that
flow
from
a
different
result,
from
a
different
interpretation.
in
the
light
of
all
those
factors,
we
believe
that
the
board's
interpretation
of
the
section,
as
well
as
which
has
been
approved
by
the
second
and
the
seventh
circuit
courts
of
appeals,
is
a
correct
one.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
these
are
the
only
two
--
this
case,
your
honor,
and
the
wagner
iron
works
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
now
also
pending
before
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari
and
to
which
we
have
recently
consented.
these
are
the
only
two
cases
that
i
know
of.
the
question,
however,
has
arisen,
your
honor,
in
--
in
situations
where
you
do
have
a
contract
and
where
the
union
or
--
may
seek
to
--
may
wish
to
terminate
or
to
modify.
and,
section
8
(d)
clearly
applies
in
that
situation,
but
the
question
is,
what
is
the
waiting
period
prescribed
by
section
8
(d)
in
such
situations?
we
--
there
is
a
case,
now
pending
upon
our
petition
for
certiorari
before
this
court
in
the
lion
oil
case,
which
brings
up
that
problem.
here,
the
question
is,
does
section
8
(d)
apply
at
all?
in
the
lion
oil
case,
concededly,
section
8
(d)
applies
but
the
question
is,
how
do
you
interpret
the
waiting
period?
what
does
the
waiting
period
mean?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
a
very
different
problem.
that's
quite
right,
your
honor.
that
question
has
come
up
before
the
board
two
or
three
times
but,
on
this
issue
presented
here,
the
wagner
iron
works
and
this
case
are
the
only
ones
that
i'm
aware
of.
thank
you.
