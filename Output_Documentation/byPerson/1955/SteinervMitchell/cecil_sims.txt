mr.
cecil
sims
may
it
please
the
--
mr.
cecil
sims
--
court.
this
case
arises
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938
more
frequently
referred
to
as
the
wage
and
hour
act.
the
particular
question
involves
the
interpretation
of
an
amendment
to
the
wage
and
hour
act
passed
in
1947,
known
as
the
portal-to-portal
amendment
to
the
wage
and
hour
act.
and
the
question
presented
involved
in
the
case
and
under
the
facts
of
the
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
section
4,
subsections
(1)
(2)
of
the
act
in
question
and
stated
in
the
terms
of
the
cases
et
cetera.
the
question
is,
whether
or
not,
under
the
portal-to-portal
act,
the
amendment,
the
time
used
by
the
petitioner's
employees
had
its
battery
manufacturing
claim
in
changing
their
street
clothes
into
work
clothes
before
punching
at
the
clock
at
7:30.
and
the
time
after
they
had
finished
their
day's
work
and
punched
out
the
clock.
and
then
went
back
and
removed
their
clothes
in
which
they
were
working
and
took
shower
baths.
about
30
minutes
a
day,
10
minutes
in
the
first
operation
and
about
20
minutes
in
the
other,
whether
or
not,
that
is
compensable
time.under
the
amendment
of
1947,
the
language
of
which
generally
speaking
provided
that
--
that
it
there
should
not
be
included
in
compensable
time.
the
time
spent
in
certain
'preliminary'
and
'postliminary'
activities
before
going
to
work
and
after
coming
from
the
work,
in
the
absence
of
a
custom
or
a
practice
at
the
petitioners'
establishment
or
any
absence
of
a
written
contract
making
those
particular
activities
compensatory.
mr.
cecil
sims
on
each
day,
there's
about
10
minutes
at
the
beginning
and
change
when
the
employee
comes
in
and
takes
off
their
clothes
and
puts
on
some
work
clothes.
that's
about
10
minutes.
that's
about
20
minutes
when
he
gets
off
and
finishes
his
work
manufacturing
the
batteries.
and
goes
in
and
removes
the
work
clothing
and
takes
a
shower
bath
and
gets
his
street
clothing
out
of
his
locker
and
go
and
--
and
leaves
the
premise,
about
30
minutes.
the
case,
if
the
court
please,
arose
by
the
secretary
of
labor
filing
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
at
nashville,
seeking
an
injunction.
because,
under
the
admitted
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
no
record
kept
of
that
particular
time
of
changing
clothes
or
taking
a
shower
bath.
nor
was
there
any
effort
to
compensate
for
that
time
that
was
consumed
on
the
premises
by
the
petitioners'
employees.
mr.
cecil
sims
well
that,
of
course,
in
--
in
a
sense,
it
is
advisable
for
a
number
of
reasons
as
to
whether
it
is
a
requirement.
in
other
words,
whether
you
could
make
batteries
in
your
street
clothes
and
leave
without
taking
a
shower
bath.
of
course,
you
could,
but
there
is
no
dispute
and
we
--
we
concede
in
the
argument
here.
that
it
was
medically
advisable
for
the
employee
to
change
clothes
and
not
work
in
his
street
clothes
for
a
number
of
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
there
were
acids
used
in
the
manufacture
of
batteries
which
could
have
destroyed
it
and
he
had
a
question
of
economy
or
which
might
have
been
to
some
extent
injurious
to
his
health
if
he
continued
to
wear
the
same
clothes
on
which
he
got
acids.
the
--
mr.
cecil
sims
they
were
not
required.
we
have
a
stipulation,
if
the
court
please.
perhaps,
i'd
better
get
right
to
the
stipulation
that
includes
the
basic
facts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
petitioner
has
two
businesses
and
next
door
to
this
battery
manufacturing
plant,
the
petitioner
owns
a
salvage
business
and
runs
a
laundry.
and
the
petitioner
permitted
the
employees
to
use
old
clothes
that
he
had
acquired
in
the
salvage
business
which
had
been
laundered
free
rather
than
using
their
street
clothes.
and
they
--
no
charge
was
made
for
it.
and
they
did
use
the
clothing
of
no
particular
type.
it
was
not
a
special
clothing
required
in
the
process
of
manufacturing.
the
basic
facts
--
mr.
cecil
sims
no,
if
your
honor
please.
i'm
trying
to
say
within
the
stipulation
that
i
--
i
believe
if
i
read
just
one
or
two
sections
from,
i
--
i
won't
violate
the
--
there's
no
dispute
about
any
basic
fact.
we
differ
only
as
to
what
should
be
the
conclusion
drawn
from
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
that's
a
question
the
court
will
have
to
determine.
it
is
stipulated
and
your
honors
we'll
find
it
on
--
in
the
record.
defendants,
that's
the
petitioner
here,
have
never
issued
any
order
nor
do
they
make
any
requirement
requiring
their
plant
employees
to
use
the
clothes-changing
and
showering
facilities
which
they
make
available.
that
answers,
i
believe,
one
of
the
questions.
most
of
the
employees
do
regularly
change
from
their
street
clothes
to
work
clothes
before
reporting
to
their
work
in
the
morning
and
most
of
them
do,
regular,
take
a
shower
in
defendant's
shower
room
and
change
back
into
the
street
clothing
after
leaving
their
working
places
in
the
evening.
that
has
reference
to
the
fact
it
was
part
of
the
work
where
they
work.
now,
the
stipulations
also
provides,
however,
some
employees
do
not
follow
this
procedure.
and
it
stipulated
these
defendants
make
no
requirement
of
any
kind
as
to
the
type
of
clothes,
and
which
are
to
be
worn
by
their
employees
during
work
hours.
and
the
clothes
or
type
of
clothes
which
are
worn
by
the
employees
is
entirely
optional
with
the
employees.
now,
the
most
and
perhaps
the
most
important
part
of
the
entire
stipulation
is
the
sentence
that
i
will
read
next.
in
those
instances
where
special
equipment
is
required
such
as
respirators,
gloves,
and
so
forth,
defendants
employees
are
paid
for
the
time
taken
in
putting
on
such
special
equipment
and
in
removing
the
same.
this,
however,
is
done
during
the
work
shift
and
as
a
practical
matter
involves
very
little
time.
mr.
cecil
sims
that
stipulation
is
at
--
in
the
record
at
page
9
(a)
to
and
--
and
10.
mr.
cecil
sims
in
other
words,
if
the
court
please,
where
in
the
process
of
manufacturing
batteries,
a
man
must
wear
a
respirator
in
order
to
keep
fumes
form
hazards
and
lead
fumes
being
inhaled
and
--
and
injuring
him
personally.
it
stipulated
that,
that
type
of
special
equipment
is
put
on
after
the
employee
punches
the
clock.
it's
--
the
only
problem
we
have
in
the
case
is
the
time
before
7:30
when
the
man
comes
in
after
his
breakfast
at
home
and
takes
off
his
street
clothes
and
go
to
his
locker,
picks
any
kind
of
clothes
he
wants,
there's
no
particular
time
required,
and
puts
them
on.
and
then
reports
to
his
station
of
duty
and
begins
to
manufacture
batteries,
whatever
his
type
of
work
is.
mr.
cecil
sims
that
--
that
is
a
fact.
mr.
cecil
sims
oh,
yes.
it's
an
important
--
i
don't
think
it's
important
in
the
ultimate
construction
of
the
statute.
it
is
true,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
cecil
sims
yes.
it
of
course,
has
a
direct
relationship
to
the
work.
there's
no
problem
about
that.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
preliminary
in
character
or
whether
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
principal
activities
simply
because
it
is
a
health
requirement.
now,
i've
been
speaking
of
health
requirements.
the
chief
justice
is
correct
in
the
saying
that
the
record
shows,
that
under
the
law
of
tennessee,
employers
of
this
nature
must
maintain
shower
baths.
that's
statutory
and
that's
required
for
the
convenience
and
use
of
its
--
mr.
cecil
sims
--
employees.
it
is
also
true
that
under
the
tennessee
workmen's
compensation
act,
lead
poisoning,
is
a
--
is
an
occupational
disease
which
would
be
compensable.
and,
of
course,
there
is
a
mutual
benefit,
no
question
about
that,
derived
from
body
cleanliness
and
from
the
precautions
that
are
--
were
required
in
order
to
prevent
health
hazards.
that
we
readily
concede
in
the
case.
that
we
--
we
certainly
don't
argue
in
this
case
that
there's
no
reasonable
connection
between
taking
the
bath.
that
there
is
no
connection
whatever.
there
is
a
connection.
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not,
when
a
man
takes
a
bath
to
remove
particles
of
lead
that
might
have
adhered
to
his
body,
which
might
prove
a
health
hazard
if
it
got
into
an
open
sore.
whether
or
not,
he
takes
a
bath
after
he's
left
his
place
of
work
for
that
reason,
it
becomes
an
integral
part
of
his
work
as
distinguished
from
a
coal
miner
who
comes
out
of
the
coal
and
takes
a
bath
to
get
clean
or
for
hygienic
reasons.
now,
the
government
concedes
that
a
person
who
takes
a
bath
to
get
clean
or
to
get
grease
or
to
get
coal
or
dust
(inaudible)
is
engaging
in
a
'postliminary'
activity,
even
though
he'd
got
the
coal
dust
on
him
down
in
the
mines.
now,
then
if
there's
something
else
on
him
that
he
washed
off
at
the
same
time
with
the
coal
dust
that
have
a
health
hazard
to
it,
the
government's
position
is
that
that
makes
that
so
essentially
and
integrally
connected
with
mining
coal
that
it
becomes
a
part
of
mining
coal.
mr.
cecil
sims
oh,
no.
the
--
the
--
mr.
cecil
sims
--
insurance
is
just
for
requirement.
the
--
the
insurance
referred
to
in
the
record
is
this.
in
tennessee,
occupational
diseases
are
compensable
under
the
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
cecil
sims
you
don't
have
to
carry
insurance
if
you
are
financially
responsible
though
you
may
ensure
of
that
--
mr.
cecil
sims
--
risk.
and
i
--
i
think
that
we
should
concede
that
if
we
urged
our
employees
not
to
take
a
bath,
that
they
would
be,
perhaps,
exposed
to
some
type
of
health
hazards.
and
in
due
course
of
time,
it
might
infect
our
insurance
claims
under
the
workmen's
compensation.
but
that
is
the
--
mr.
cecil
sims
--
relationship.
now,
if
the
court
please.
the
--
it's
important
that
i
get
before
the
court,
as
quickly
as
possible,
the
exact
language
of
the
statute
that
we
are
contending
about.
because
after
all,
what
we
are
concerned
is,
is
what
is
law.
and
not
what
the
law
should
be.
not
whether
it
would
be
reasonable
to
make
a
distinction
as
a
legislative
matter,
but
whether
or
not,
congress
has
made
that
distinction.
so,
i
will
come
quickly
to
the
language
about
which
we
disagree.
the
portal-to-portal
amendment,
which
was
passed
in
1947,
provides,
explicitly,
and
it's
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
at
pages
84
and
85.
and
that's
what
i'm
reading
from
at
the
moment.
that
provides
explicitly
that
except
for
certain
exceptions,
not
important
here,
"no
employee
shall
be
subjected
to
any
liability,
on
account
of
the
failure
of
an
employer,
to
pay
the
employee
wages
or
to
keep
records."
and
now
i'm
quoting,
"for
or
on
account
of
any
of
the
following
activities
of
such
employee
engaged
in
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of
this
act."
now,
what
are
those
activities
for
which
or
any
of
which
we
are
not
to
be
liable?
first,
walking,
riding
or
traveling
to
and
from
the
actual
place
of
performance
of
the
principal
activity
or
activities
which
such
employee
is
employed
to
perform.
and
second,
activities
which
are
preliminary
to
or
postliminary
to,
said
principle
activity
or
activities
which
occur
either
prior
to
the
time
on
any
particular
workday
at
which
such
employee
commences
or
subsequent
to
the
time
on
any
particular
workday
at
which
he
ceases
such
principal
activity
or
activities.
now,
that's
in
the
absence
of
an
express
contract
to
the
contrary.
and
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
we
have
no
such
contract.
and
it's
in
the
absence
of
any
custom
or
practice
and
there
is
no
such
custom
or
practices.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
against
us
and
the
exact
basis
of
the
adverse
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
expressed
in
one
sentence
as
follows.
the
changing
of
clothes
and
taking
of
shower
baths
at
that
time
and
in
the
manner
herein
described
are
regular
practices
which
are
recognized
as
essential
safeguards
against
the
serious
occupational
hazards
to
which
appellants
employees
are
daily
subjected
in
the
performance
of
their
duties,
is
sufficient
to
render
them
an
integral
and
indispensable
part
of
the
principal
activities
which
they
are
employed
to
perform,
within
the
meaning
of
the
portal-to-portal
act.
and
time
spent
in
such
activities
is
time
worked
within
the
meaning
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
now,
that
is
specifically
what
we
disagree
with
in
the
case.
and
our
insistence,
if
the
court
please,
specifically
in
the
language
of
the
admitted
and
conceded
facts
of
the
case
is
this.
there
are
two
types
of
activity
which
an
employee
engages
in
under
the
act.
they're
both
related,
of
course.
the
one's
connected
with
the
other.
the
first
is
the
principal
activity.
and
that's
the
work
for
which
the
employee
was
hired.
that's
when
he
begins
whatever
his
part
in
the
actual
manufacturing
process
is,
the
manufacturing
of
batteries.
that's
between
7:30
in
the
morning
and
4
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
now,
it
is
our
insistence
that
changing
your
clothes,
in
order
to
engage
in
the
principal
activity,
is
clearly
under
the
language
of
the
portal-to-portal
act,
a
preliminary
activity,
and
removing
work
clothes
and
taking
a
shower
bath,
after
you
have
finished
your
principal
activity
of
manufacturing
batteries
is
clearly
a
postliminary
activity.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
essential
character
of
that
particular
act,
as
between
whether
there's
a
principal
activity
or
preliminary
or
postliminary
activity,
whether
you
are
induced
to
engage
in
that
ancillary
act
for
hygiene
reasons
--
hygienic
reasons
or
for
health
reasons.
and
that's
the
reason
i
answered
the
chief
justice
a
moment
ago.
that
while
it
is
true,
that
here,
we
have
a
health
case,
nevertheless,
the
reason
for
it,
about
which
there's
no
dispute,
does
not
rub
it
of
its
essential
character
of
being
postliminary
and
preliminary.
now,
--
mr.
cecil
sims
not
--
not
quite
said.
essentially
that
but
if
suppose
the
employer,
would
under
the
guise
of,
letting
him
do
something
like
oiling
the
machinery
or
something
of
that
sort,
case
of
subterfuge.
we
don't
contend
that
there
can't
be
a
case
when
the
activity
itself
is
--
is
called
in
--
in
terms
that
are
not
applicable
to
the
substance.
but
here
we
have
a
bonafide,
thet
everyday
act
of
changing
in
work
clothes
and
everyday
act
of
taking
a
bath
after
they
get
through.
and
they
concede
in
their
brief
that
if
a
man
is
washing
to
get
off
grease,
washing
to
get
off
dirt,
is
preliminary
and
postliminary.
but
if
he's
doing
it
to
get
off
particles
of
lead
which
might
sometimes
infect
him,
then
it
has
a
different
connection.
and,
of
course,
we
say
that
that's
a
different
motive,
a
proper
motive
but
it's
the
same
act
and
certainly,
if
the
court
please,
taking
a
bath
does
not
become
a
part
of
the
principal
activity
of
manufacturing
batteries.
one
is
a
manual
process
of
doing
something.
the
other
is
getting
yourself
clean
because
you
don't
want
to
catch
up
occupational
disease.
now,
the
court
please.
we
resort
to
the
primary
root.
what
is
the
simple
meaning
of
the
words
"preliminary"
and
"postliminary"?
and
since
my
time
is
slipping
away,
your
honor,
of
course,
knows
that
this
portal-to-portal
act
was
passed
following
three
decisions
of
this
court,
tennessee
coal
against
muscoda
in
321.
jewell
ridge
against
the
local
in
325
and
anderson
against
mt.
clemens
pottery
co.
now
in
--
in
--
this
court
decided
those
three
cases.
and
they
involved
taking
shower
baths.
and
they
involved
changing
clothes.
and
in
--
in
a
number
of
instances,
there
was
direct
involved
taking
shower
baths
as
a
health
regulation.
and
this
court
held
that
they
were
compensable
apart
of
the
--
by
mr.
justice
murphy.
thereupon
congress
said,
we're
going
to
remedy
that.
we
don't
change
it.
and
they
passed
what
is
called
the
portal
act.
so,
we
find
that
congress
in
its
declaration
of
its
purpose,
its
--
its
findings
and
declaration
of
policy.
and
we've
set
it
out
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
take
the
time
to
read
it.
we've
set
it
out.
they
said
that
the
purpose
is
to
make
these
acts
that
the
court
has
just
declared
in
these
cases
as
a
part
of
the
work
day
to
exclude
them
from
the
work
day
unless
they
are
included
by
the
custom
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
business
or
the
trade
itself
are
brought
in
under
a
collective-bargaining
contract.
we
have
two
cases.
one
very
famous
case
that
was
pending
when
congress
passed
the
act.
it's
a
district
court
case
and
it
was
amended
so
as
to
bring
in
the
question
of
the
scope
of
this
--
this
act.
it's
the
case
of
swanson,
mccomb
against
swanson.
and
i
can't
emphasize,
too
much,
that
it
states
our
position
exactly.
it
was
a
district
court
case.
it's
reported
in
77
federal,
rose
in
omaha,
nebraska.
and
there,
if
the
court
please,
people
were
engaged
in
the
preparation
of
food
for
human
consumption.
and
we
had
a
federal
--
and
we
had
a
state
law
that
made
it
mandatory
that
they
wear
certain
types
of
white
uniforms
made
out
of
a
certain
material
that
was
washed.
now,
that
wasn't
to
protect
the
health
of
the
employee
but
it
was
to
prevent
the
food
from
being
contaminated
which
is
a
half
step
closer
to
the
actual
principal
activity
for
which
a
man
was
employed.
and
they
were
furnished
and
the
wearing
of
the
uniforms
were
required.
and
there
was
a
federal
inspector
that
would
not
let
them
go
to
work
until
he
inspected
them
to
see
they
had
that
on.
the
question
came
up
just
as
it
did
in
this
case.
and
at
the
expense
of
using
a
little
time
because
this
is
the
position
on
which
we
rely.
the
district
judge
held
in
that
case,
no
appeal
was
taken,
and
that
case
remained
the
law
until
this
case
as
we
see
it.
now,
defining
antecedent.now,
the
defining
antecedent
of
the
phrase
said
the
court,
judge
delehant.
the
defining
antecedent
of
the
phrase
“principal
activity”
or
activities
is
section
254
(a)
(2)
--
in
section
254
(a)
(2)
appears
in
254
(a)
(1),
in
the
language,
quoting
from
the
statute,
"the
principal
activity
or
activities
which
such
employee
is
employed
to
perform."
those
words
are
not
abstruse,
obscure,
or
uncertain.
they
refer
to
the
productive
work
in
behalf
of
the
employer
which
he
has
or
working
to
do.
that's
the
principal
activity.
for
the
machinist,
it
is
the
work
that
has
been
so
laid,
for
the
store
clerk,
the
sale
of
goods.
for
the
carpenter,
to
labor
in
the
erection
or
repair
of
the
building.
and
as
we
say,
for
the
battery
manufacturer,
the
manufacture
of
batteries
for
automobiles.
now,
when
the
court
in
the
swanson
case
came
to
what
is
meant
by
'postliminary'
and
"preliminary'
they
said,
the
court
said
this,
"preliminary"
and
"postliminary"
are
not
words
of
dubious
or
recondite,
or
confusing
significance
even
if
the
latter
is
not
frequently
employed.
and
there
they
held
that
even
though
the
putting
on
of
certain
uniform
was
required
under
the
federal
inspection,
even
though
they
had
the
direct
relationship
of
preventing
contamination
of
the
food
that
they
were
going
to
manufacture,
they
were
nevertheless,
were
not
principal
activities.
the
congress,
had
legislated
on
the
basis
of
principal
activities
and
postliminary
and
preliminary
activities
without
making
any
distinction
of
why
a
man
took
a
bath.
whether
it
was
for
reasons
of
health
or
whether
it
was
merely
to
get
cleaned.
now,
just
a
few
months
ago,
the
eighth
circuit
had
the
same
case.
(inaudible)
case,
that's
the
best
i
can
do
on
it.
decided
april
29th,
1955
by
the
eighth
circuit.
and
they
had
exactly
the
same
question
because
there,
the
men
were
working
in
a
powder
plant
and
they
got
these
nitroglycerin
and
powder
and
things
like
that
all
over.
and
there,
they
were
required
by
the
--
by
the
operator.
both
as
a
matter
of
safety
and
as
a
matter
of
health
to
change
their
clothes
and
take
a
bath,
exactly
the
same
situation
we
have
here.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
pointed
out
and
i'm
quoting,
“they
were
required
to
take
a
shower
as
a
safety
measure
for
the
employee's
own
health,
to
avoid
after
effects
of
powder
remaining
on
the
person
of
the
employee."
now
here's
what
the
court
said.
they
said,
“we're
not
concerned
with
the
reason
that
impels
a
man
to
take
a
bath,
nor
was
congress
concerned."
they
said
if
it's
postliminary
or
preliminary,
of
course,
it
has
to
have.
a
man
wouldn't
do
something
that
had
no
relationship
to
--
to
his
work
normally.
but
the
eighth
circuit
said
this,
"if
the
time
principal
activity
was
intended
to
include
ipso
facto
activities
--
activity
necessarily
incident
to
the
principal
activity,
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
applying
the
1949
amendment
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
and
the
application
of
section
254
(a)
(1)
prohibiting
the
inclusion
of
necessarily
preliminary
and
postliminary
activities
in
compensable
time
for
principal
activities
unless
so
recognized
by
contract,
a
custom
would
likewise
be
circumscribed.
and
the
court
concluded
in
this
language.
we
must
conclude
that
the
necessity
of
an
activity
to
the
performance
of
the
principal
activity
will
not
alone
make
the
former
a
part
of
principal
activities.
so
we
say,
in
the
first
instance,
if
the
court
please.
taking
the
simple,
ordinary,
meaning
of
the
english
language.
whether
this
court
or
whether
the
department
of
labor
would
have
gone
further
and
legislated
that
if
a
man's
taking
a
bath
because
it's
a
health
hazard,
that's
he
is
trying
to
eliminate,
he
should
be
paid
irrespective
that
congress
has
not
made
that
distinction.
now,
the
secondary
rules
of
interpretation
of
statutes,
the
legislative
history,
we
think,
bears
us
out.
we
have
set
it
out
in
our
brief.
the
government
has
it
in
--
in
their
brief.
and
we're
not
contending
that
you
could
by
trick
or
artifice
put
over
into
the
category
of
preliminary
and
postliminary,
something
that
was
really
a
part
of
the
work
itself.
we're
not
contending
that.
of
course,
no
one
would
make
that.
but
we
say
in
conclusion,
that
the
distinction
must
be
made
on
the
basis
that
congress
obviously
intended
it
to
be
made.
what
is
a
man's
principal
activity?
manufacturing
the
batteries.
was
this
postliminary
and
preliminary,
changing
clothes
and
taking
a
bath?
certainly.
why
did
he
do
it?
he
wanted
to
protect
his
health.
but,
why
he
did
it,
doesn't
rob
it
of
its
character
of
preliminary
and
postliminary,
in
the
legislative
sense
in
which
the
portal
--
the
portal
amendment
was
adopted.
bathing
is
not
any
part
of
the
principal
activity.
certainly,
it's
not
an
integral
part
of
manufacturing
batteries.
now,
if
a
man
was
a
deep
sea
diver,
or
sponge
fisherman,
or
something
like
that,
and
he
had
put
on
his
helmet
and
so
on,
there'd
be
no
problem.
from
there,
then
we
would
have
a
quite
different
situation.
mr.
cecil
sims
77
is
a
case
from
omaha
--
mr.
cecil
sims
this
is
swanson
case.
mr.
cecil
sims
that
case
--
after
--
after
this
court
had
decided
the
muscoda
case
--
mr.
cecil
sims
--
there
were
myriads
of
decisions.
i
mean
of
lawsuits
that
were
brought,
that
would
have
just
wrecked
the
whole
industry.
and
that
was
the
reason
for
the
portal-to-portal
act.
mr.
cecil
sims
that
case
was
brought
after
the
muscoda
decision
by
this
court
and
before
the
passage
of
the
portal-to-portal
act.
but
it
was
not
tried
until
long
after
the
passage
of
the
portal-to-portal
act.
and
they
amended
the
--
the
--
mr.
cecil
sims
it
was
tried
so
as
include
claims
that
had
accrued
before
the
passage
of
the
act
and
claims
that
have
had
approved
afterwards.
and
the
decision
is
clear
on
both
points.
