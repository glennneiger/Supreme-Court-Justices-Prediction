what
--
were
all
the
clothes
furnished
by
the
employer?
justice
harold
burton
ms.
margolin.
justice
harold
burton
after
you
get
through
determining
what
is
the
principal
activity
--
that
is
the
chemical
industry,
don't
you
have
a
question
of
fact
that
in
writing
almost
in
each
one
of
these
(inaudible)
where
activity
begins
and
where
the
activities
doesn't
begin?
justice
harold
burton
well,
here
you've
had
a
district
judge
and
the
three
court
of
appeals
judges
determining
that
this
was
within,
not
only
principal
but
within
activity.
justice
harold
burton
but
after
you
get
through
your
legislative
history
--
justice
harold
burton
--
the
administrator
ever
--
to
check
to
define
these
regulations.
justice
harold
burton
but
why
--
why
look
at
just
the
senator
to
complete
this
language.
i've
had
great
difficulty
in
following
you
there.
justice
harold
burton
and
you
told
me,
he
could
not
perform
his
activity
and
here,
a
number
of
these
do
perform
it
as
i
understand
it
all
the
way
justice
harold
burton
but
there's
certainly
--
justice
harold
burton
(inaudible)
he
can't
make
without
it.
he
can't
make
batteries
without
his
mask.
justice
harold
burton
he
did
it
for
that?
