ms.

may
it
please
the
court.
since
this
case
and
the
case,
to
be
obvious,
following
this
mitchell
versus
king
packing,
raised
the
same
legal
questions,
it
may
be
helpful
if
i
take
the
time
to
show
just
what
the
legal
position
of
the
government
is
in
both
of
these
cases.
and
to
point
out
--
to
point
out
the
basic
difference
in
the
legal
approach
between
the
sixth
circuit
in
this
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
king
packing
case.
our
position
is
that
section
4
of
the
portal
act,
which
counsel,
mr.
sims,
has
read
you,
although,
i
don't
think
he
emphasized
the
key
words,
"principal
activities"
to
the
extent
that
we
feel
is
warranted.
and
that
is
the
section
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
,
is
markedly
different
from
section
2.
now,
there
has
been
a
tendency
in
the
court
to
confuse
these
two
sections
and
not
to
recognize
the
marked
difference.
it
has
worked
both
ways.
some
of
the
courts
have
gone
so
far
as
to
hold
principal
activities
is
covered
under
section
2.
and
we
don't
contend
that
principal
activities,
which
we
define
and
we
think
the
legislative
history
supports
us
as
activities
which
are
an
integral
part
of
and
indispensable
to
the
employee's
job,
whether
performed
during
the
scheduled
workday
or
before
or
after
the
scheduled
workday.
there
was
principal
activities
under
section
4
were
preserved
by
the
act.
and
congress
was
very
careful,
although,
i
gave
a
very
drastic
remedy
for
existing
claims
at
the
time
it
enacted
--
enacted
the
portal
act,
because
of
the
--
of
the
flood
of
litigation
that
developed
following
the
mt.
clemens
case.
congress
did
because
of
it,
what
it
deemed
an
emergency,
gave
a
drastic
remedy
and
made
non-compensable
all
claims
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
act.
it
was
very
careful,
however,
in
drawing
section
4
of
the
act.
and
that
section
went
through
several
drafts.it
was
formulated
in
the
senate
and
went
through
several
versions
in
the
senate.
and
that
section
was
carefully
drafted
as
the
language
on
the
face
of
the
--
builds,
shows
in
the
face
of
the
statute.
and
as
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
beyond
doubt,
it
was
carefully
drafted
so
as
to
preserve
the
--
just
the
type
of
activity
which
is
involved
here
and
in
the
king
packing
case.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
sections
are
quoted
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
in
--
in
the
king
packing
case
that's
number
39.
both
sections
are
quoted
there
and
they're
also
quoted
in
their
brief
in
the
(inaudible)
case
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
it's
about
(inaudible)
i'll
state
first
what
the
--
what
the
difference
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
position
is.
and
i
think
that
will
clarify
what
our
position
is.
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
instant
case,
took
the
position
that
any
activity
which
was
an
integral
part
of
and
indispensable
to
the
performance
of
the
employee's
principal
activity
was
a
part
of
that
principal
activity
and
was
not
preliminary
or
postliminary
within
the
meaning
of
the
--
of
the
exclusion
in
section
4
of
the
portal
act.
the
ninth
circuit
took
the
position
that
no
matter
how
necessary,
how
indispensable
or
how
integral
a
part
of
the
principal
activity,
the
knife
sharpening
time
it
was
in
that
case
was
the
fact
that
it
was
performed
outside
or
before
or
after
the
scheduled
work
shift
on
the
production
line.
that
fact
was
the
decisive
consideration.
and
it
didn't
matter
how
integral
it
was.
now,
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
mr.
sims'
position.
the
government's
position
is
as
the
sixth
circuit
has
held
that
a
principal
activity
of
it
the
decisive
fact
here
by
no
means
when
it
is
performed,
the
time
that
which
this
is
performed
that
a
principal
activity
may
occur
prior
to
or
after
the
scheduled
workday.
and
the
question
is
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no,
the
scheduled
workday
is
not
in
the
statute.
and
i'm
coming
to
that
point
because
i
--
we
think
the
legislative
history
demonstrates.
it
was
deliberately
--
the
congress
deliberately
refrained
from
using
scheduled
workday
or
contract
workday
or
whistle
to
whistle
all
of
which
terms,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
were
quite
familiar
with.
but
they
deliberately
refrained,
for
good
reasons,
from
using
those
terms.
the
statute
uses
and
i'll
come
to
the
language
there.
the
statute
does
not
--
does
not
say
that
there
shall
be
no
liability.
does
not
say
there
should
be
no
liability
for
work
or
activities
which
are
preliminary
or
postliminary
to
the
scheduled
workday
or
to
whistle
to
whistle
or
to
the
--
the
contract
work
week.
it
say's
that
they're
--
it
uses
the
term
activities
which
are
preliminary
to
or
postliminary
to
said
principal
activity
or
activities.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i'm
reading
from
the
section
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
page
36
of
the
king
packing
brief.
that's
the
section
4
i'm
reading
from.
these
two
briefs
we
--
we
rather
consolidate
it
so
the
terms
that
don't
appear
in
--
in
--
fall
in
the
king
--
in
the
summary
brief,
i'm
afraid.
but
they
are
on
page
36
of
the
king
packing
brief.
the
section
starts
on
page
35
which
says
"no
employer
shall
be
subject
to
any
liability
on
account
of
failure
of
such
employee
to
pay
an
employee
et
cetera,
on
or
after
the
date
of
enactment
of
the
act,
for
walking,
one
is
walking,
riding
or
traveling
to
and
from
the
actual
place
of
performance
of
the
principal
activity
or
activities,
which
the
employee
as
employee
performs."
in
other
words,
they
specify
walking,
riding,
or
travelling
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they're
out.
they're
specifically
out,
and
two
with
the
activities
which
are
preliminary
to
or
postliminary
to
said
principal
activity
or
activities.
now,
that
obviously
means
something
more
than
they
--
and
concededly
mean
something
more
than
walking,
riding
or
travelling.and
the
question
is,
how
much
more?
ms.
bessie
margolin
what,
yes.
what
--
what
in
addition
to
that?
we
think
the
legislative
history
supports
this
and
that,
and
i
will
come
back
to
the
statutory
language
and
show
--
try
to
take
the
time
to
show
the
court
the
differences
in
the
bill,
the
successive
bills.
that
what
is
meant
by
the
preliminary
and
postliminary
are
simply
incidental
activities
of
the
same
nature
of
walking
riding
and
travelling,
such
as
checking
in
and
checking
out,
waiting
in
line
for
paycheck,
clothes
changing,
admittedly,
in
most
instances
where
it's
purely
for
the
convenience
of
the
employee.
that
type
of
activity
which
is
likely
to
be
incidental
to
almost
any
kind
of
employment.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
he
puts
on
overall
because
he
wants
to
save
his
clothes
and
not
for
any
--
not
because
of
the
specific
type
of
work
he
is
doing
requires,
that
he
change
his
clothes
as
in
the
instant
case.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
if
--
that
would
be,
that
would
be
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
principal.
that
would
be
principal
activity
and
not
preliminary.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
justice
here
putting
on
his
clothes
and
taking
a
shower
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
oh,
the
mask
is
certainly
a
part.
that
is,
this
is
not
something
that
would
be
just
incidental
to
almost
--
to
the
ordinary
employment.
this
is
something
that's
directly
required
by
the
specific
kind
of
work
the
employee
is
performing.
and
we
say
that,
that
in
that
case,
the
two
courts
below
were
certainly
correct
in
finding
that
that
is
an
integral
part
of
this
particular
kind
of
work
in
a
chemical
battery
plant.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.i
want
to
call
attention
to
that.
there
was
--
it
was
stipulated
and
i
think
a
little
loosely,
frankly,
that
the
stipulation
appears
in
the
record
on
page
–
this
is
on
--
this
section
of
it
is
on
page
10
(a).
defendants
have
never
issued
any
order
nor
do
they
make
any
requirement
requiring
their
plant
employees
to
use
the
clothes-changing
and
showering
facilities
they
make
available.now,
that
stipulation
was
called
to
the
attention
of
both
courts
below,
of
course.
and
they
viewed
it
as
simply
as
stipulation
that
there
was
no
formal
order
issued,
no
formal
requirement
made.
and
i
refer
the
court
to
the
--
on
the
question
of
requirement
to
say
that
it's
a
practical
matter
in
the
industrial
reality
that
was
required.
certainly
as
--
as
a
health
protection
and
hygienic
--
this
was
the
usual
hygienic
measure
required
by
the
nature
of
the
work,
and
finding
8
--
findings
8
and
12
of
the
district
court
shows
what
the
--
how
the
court
treated
that
stipulation,
which
as
i
say,
is
rather
this,
we
phrased
but
really
doesn't
answer
the
whole
question
of
–
of
what
is
required
in
the
--
in
a
legal
sense.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'm
thinking
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
even
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
you
could.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
to
principal
activities
still
you
have
the
question
of
what
is
principal
activity.
the
mt.
clemens
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it
might
be
but
other
things
might
be
too.
in
--
in
other
words,
the
principal
activity
isn't
that
simple
and
any
body
who
knows
anything
about
the
realities
of
--
of
industry
and
that's
what
congress
--
congress
said.
that
you
can't
and
anyone
who
knows
anything
about
reality
knows
that
--
that
this
varies
from
industry
to
industry.
and
they
had
a
terrific
time
trying
to
--
they've
try
to
find
it's
birthdayin
one
of
these
bills.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
said
they
--
they
couldn't
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
you
don't
need
to
know
--
need
to
go
to
the
legislative
history.
ms.
bessie
margolin
you
just
need
to
know
something
about
the
realities
of
the
industry
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
to
know
that
principal
activity
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
that's
right.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
all
--
well
--
well,
i
don't
think
principal
is
–
is
quiet
that
simple
in
words.
ms.
bessie
margolin
all
right
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
if
you
looked
in
the
dictionary,
i
think
you
wouldn't
find
it
but
also
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
principal
means
when
there's
something
that
is
a
--
so
closely
related
and
integral
a
part
of
--
of
the
job
that
i'm
hired
to
do,
that
--
it
couldn't
--
well
it's
indispensable
to
it.
and
it's
just
a
part
of
that
specific
job.
and
anything
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
too,
you
can't
make
nonsense
out
the
reality
that
the
situation
in
that
and
anyone
that
has
–
that
had
any
experience
with
the
statutes
regulating
industry,
knows
that
there's
quite
a
question
as
to
when
an
employee
begins
his
principal
activity.
ms.
bessie
margolin
when
do
you
say
he's
beginning
his
job?and
that
is
the
subject
frequently,
of
course,
for
contract.
but
congress,
here,
didn't
want
to
make
it
solely
a
subject
for
contract
because
they
felt
it
would
be
unfair
to
the
unorganized
worker.
ms.
bessie
margolin
now,
let
me
make
this
one
point
because
i
think
it
answers
what
you
--
a
much
clearer,
a
much
simpler
way
to
get
across
what
--
what
you
--
what
you
were
in
with
by
suggesting
here.
and
what
mr.
sims
is
arguing
and
what
the
ninth
circuit,
if
congress
had
intended
to
say
that
anything
prior
to
the
schedule
workday
is
preliminary.
they
could
have
said
scheduled
workday.
they
could
have
said
whistle
to
whistle.
but
they
didn't.
they
took
a
less
clear,
a
less
simple
criterion.and
they
did
it
deliberately.
now,
why
wouldn't
they
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i'm
going
to
prove
it
simply
by
comparing
the
word
principal
with
--
this
is
my
first
way
of
proving
it.
i
think
the
legislative
history
proves
it
conclusively.
ms.
bessie
margolin
by
simply
comparing
the
word,
a
word
with
the
vagueness
of
principal
and
preliminary
and
postliminary,
vague
words
like
that,
just
compare
them
with
what
congress
could
have
done.
it
could
have
simply
said,
the
contract
workday,
the
scheduled
workday,
whistle
to
whistle.
those
terms
were
used
throughout
the
--
the
debates
they
used
commonly
in
the
industry.
why
didn't
congress
take
those
words?
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
now,
they
just
wouldn't
because
it's
specifically
limited
to
the
--
to
the
time
before
and
after
the
workday.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
in
another
section,
that
the
section
goes
on
to
say
these
activities
and
they're
non-compensable
only
when
they
occur
before
the
workday
starts
and
before
it
ends.
so,
you
still
have
the
question
of
determining
--
it
--
it
has
to
be
not
only
--
and
a
preliminary
and
postliminary,
but
it
has
to
be
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
the
workday.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
had
reasons.
that
they
had
reasons
for
doing
it.
they're
very
practical
reasons.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
--
they
believed
it
and
they
deliberately
did
it
because
as
senator
donnell
said
in
the
debate,
he
said,
“we
have
spent
months
trying
to
draft
something
that
would
say
when
a
workday
begins
generally
and
when
the
workday
ends.
and
he
said,
"we've
been
unable
to
come
up
with
anything
because
there's
so
many
numerous
industries
and
all
these
different
industries
and
the
different
plants,
they
have
different
terms
of
the
principal
activity
on
a
workday
begins
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
but
congress
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
congress
established
the
basic
criterion,
a
legal
criterion.
they
say
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
have
--
they
have
established.
i
think
–
i
think
there's
been
a
--
a
really
--
a
very
small
amount
of
litigation
on
this
act
compared
to
the
--
the
amount
of
enforcement
and
the
--
the
benefits
that
had
--
had
come
about
voluntarily.
there's
been
relatively
little
litigation.
ms.
bessie
margolin
except
for
--
except
for
the
very
--
that
very
special
situation
which
had
a
variety
of
reasons
for
it
which
had
--
i
think
are
not
too
much
related
to
the
terms
of
the
fact
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
which
resulted
as
the
merits.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it's
true
justice
burton
that
this
--
this
is
largely
and
to
a
large
extent
a
question
fact.
but
there
are
certainly
situations
where
the
facts
are
so
clear,
the
facts
are
undisputed
that
the
--
that
the
legal
conclusion
--
it
is
simply
a
legal
conclusion
as
to
whether
it's
an
integral
part
of
the
job.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
there
is
--
there
is
the
finding
of
both
courts
below
here
that
this
was
a
principal
activity.
the
facts
--
the
basic
facts
are
undisputed
here.it's
just
a
question
of
drawing
the
inference
of
the
conclusion
from
those
facts.
and
that
is
done
by
applying
the
principal,
is
it
an
integral
and
indispensable
part
of
the
--
of
the
workman's
job
or
his
principal
activity?
now,
i
grant
you
that
that
is
not
something
that's
abc,
a
simple
decision
to
make.
but
it's
no
different
than
many
--
many
questions
of
statutory
interpretation,
as
to
the
application
of
a
--
of
the
legal
criterion
of
the
statute.
ms.
bessie
margolin
what
work
--
workday
or
whistle
to
whistle?
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
it
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
when
you
try
to
get
far
and
you're
--
many
times
said
to
me
that
your
--
that
the
court
should
leave
the
questions
for
congress,
certainly
not
for
the
court.
but
after
all
congress
has
400
to
500
people
that
they
have
to
get
into
agreement
on
--
on
language.
and
the
court
has
just
none.
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
which
is
enough
--
[laughter]
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i'm
sure,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
don't
need
to
tell
you
that
language
is
not
something
that
--
that
is
easy
to
make
clear.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
we
don't
think
they
went
on
to
this.
and
we
think
that
if
the
court
will
read
the
legislative
history
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
they
will
greatly
sympathize
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
the
court
will
greatly
sympathize
with
the
problem
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
administrator
did
specifically
state
that
clothes
changing
in
his
--
and
not
in
his
regulations
and
interpretation
because
he
has
no
authority.
he
had
to
issue
regulations.
but
in
his
interpretative
bulletin,
he
did
say
--
state
that
clothes
changing
in
--
in
--
where
it's
required
by
the
hazards
of
the
job
such
as
in
a
chemical
plant,
and
is
a
principal
and
not
preliminary
activity.
and
that
by
the
way,
that
interpretation
was
before
congress
in
--
when
it
enacted
the
1949
amendment.
and
i'll
come
to
that
and
show
that
while
congress
made
--
pass
section
3
(o)
in
1949,
to
permit
the
contract,
excluding
such
time
from
--
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
they
didn't
otherwise
change
that
interpretation
although,
they
knew
about
it.
it
was
called
specifically
to
their
attention.
and
although
they
knew
about
it,
they
didn't
change
it,
except
to
say
that
the
parties
might,
by
collective
bargaining
agreement,
exclude
it.
that
would
be
done,
of
course,
and
the
give
and
take
of
collective
bargaining
agreement.
but
they
--
they
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
--
that
it
could
be
excluded
if
they
were
no
collective
bargaining
agreements.
now,
to
get
to
the
specific
legislative
history
applicable
to
this
particular
point
which,
mr.
sims,
didn't
mention
and
it's
so
directly
in
point,
and
i
don't
think
i
should
finish
this
argument
without
calling
attention
to
it.
the
--
senator
cooper
who
made
the
--
who
was
selected
to
make
the
detailed
explanation
of
this
bill
on
the
senate
floor,
he
was
a
member
of
the
three-man
judiciary
committee
that
drafted
it,
held
hearings
on
it,
and
presented
it
on
the
floor.
he
was
--
he
described
the
--
these
principal
activities
as
the
key
word
for
the
statute.
and
--
and
he
was
asked
specifically
by
senator
mcgrath.
ms.
bessie
margolin
this
appears
in
--
this
is
quoted
at
some
length
in
our
brief.
ms.
bessie
margolin
page
--
page
16
of
our
brief
in
(inaudible)
case.
i
think
it
starts
on
page
13.
senator
mcgrath
specifically
asked,
inquired
to
senator
cooper
about
the
workers
in
chemical
plants
who
are
required
to
put
on
special
clothing
and
take
off
their
clothing
at
the
end
of
the
workday.
and
in
some
plants,
they
are
required
to
take
shower
baths
before
they
leave.
and
senator
cooper
answered
that
in
no
uncertain
terms.he
said
he
was
glad
the
senator
had
raised
that
question
because
i
believe
it
gives
us
the
opportunity
of
drawing
a
fine
distinction
between
the
type
of
the
activity
which
we
consider
compensable
and
the
type
which
should
not
be
compensable.
then
he
--
in
accordance
with
our
intention
as
to
the
definition
of
principal
activity
if
the
employer
--
employee
could
not
perform
his
activity
without
putting
on
certain
clothes
then
the
time
used
in
changing
into
these
clothes
would
be
compensable
as
part
of
his
principal
activity.
on
the
other
hand,
if
changing
clothes
were
merely
a
convenience
to
the
employee
and
not
directly
related
to
a
specific
work,
it
would
not
be
considered
a
part.
now,
this
does
not,
of
course,
precisely
describe
the
situation
we
have
here.
but
the
situation
we
have
in
--
in
this
chemical
plant
is,
if
anything,
more
an
integral
part,
makes
the
showering
and
the
bathing
more
of
an
integral
part.
and
i
would
like
to
just
call
attention
to
two
facts
regarding
that
--
this
battery,
wet
storage
battery
industry.
the
number
one
cause
of
occupational
disease
is
in
this
country,
and
this
was
undisputed
testimony
in
this
record.
the
number
one
cause
of
occupational
disease
is
lead
poisoning.
and
the
number
one
industry
that
is
the
source
of
lead
poisoning,
is
the
wet
storage
battery
industry.
so,
that
it
has
become
and
it
is
generally
agreed
by
industrial
and
medical
experts
that
careful
washing,
changing
of
clothes,
so
that
the
employee
doesn't
use
the
same
clothes
when
he
leaves
the
plant,
changing
of
clothes
and
a
thorough
washing
of
the
lead
and
acid
off
of
his
body,
mostly
it's
the
lead,
because
it's
only,
the
lead
are
vapors
and
the
fumes
and
the
dust,
molten
lead
is
the
--
is
the
most
hazardous
sort
of
lead
poisoning.
the
company's
own
doctor
testified
to
that.
that
it's
because
of
its
dust
that
gets
under
fingernails
and
into
the
hair.
a
very
careful
bathing
is
required
after
the
day's
work
is
over.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
he
told
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
as
--
as
one
employee,
put
it.
of
course,
he
doesn't
have
to
change
his
clothes
to
make
batteries.
but
as
the
--
he
does
--
he
said,
“suppose
i
could
do,
make
batteries
without
any
clothes
on,”
but
senator
cooper
is
not
talking
in
terms
of
--
of
whether
it's
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
it
goes
in
ingredient
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
he
wouldn't
be
making
batteries
very
long
if
he
didn't
change
his
clothes
and
shower
everyday,
either.
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
he
--
he
can
perform
his
work.
but
how
long?
in
other
words,
the
reality
of
the
situation
is,
that
--
that
he
couldn't
be
doing
his
work
for
very
long
unless
he
changed
his
clothes
and
took
a
shower
regularly
for
(inaudible)
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
or
some
of
--
some
of
them
do
and
some
of
them
get
lead
poisoning
if
the
record
shows,
too.
they
--
they're
frequently
told
and
i'm
glad.
we
call
attention
to
the
workmen's
compensation
case
which
we
saw
in
our
brief
which
was
against
this
very
company.
now,
this
and
this
goes
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
bathing
is
required,
too.
they
defended
in
a
--
in
a
suit
for
damages
on
the
grounds
that
the
employee
was
--
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence
in
not
following
instructions
to
bathe
carefully.
that
shows
how
close
it
is
to
the
work.
and
there's
no
question.
their
own
doctor
testified
that
--
that
this
--
this
was
the
best
method
of
meeting
those
hazards
and
doctor
(inaudible),
the
expert,
testified
that
this
was
the
cheapest
way
of
meeting
those
hazards.
now,
they
have
put
in
ventilating
equipment
and
all
other
kinds
of
equipment.
this
is
much
less
expensive
than
the
equipment
they
put
in.
and
that's
why
they
require
the
bathing
because
this
is
a
sure
and
easy
and
inexpensive
way
of
meeting
those
hazards.
but
it's
just
as
much
related
to
the
hazard
as
if
for
ventilating
system.
it's
just
as
much
of
a
legitimate
an
item
of
cost
as
of
the
ventilating
system.
that
--
they
--
it's
true
that
one
employee,
i
think
it
--
there
was
a
single
employee
who
said
he
didn't
use
the
--
the
shower
because
he
had
a
wounded
foot
and
he
was
afraid
of
an
infection.
and
he
lived
very
near
by
and
so
he
took
that
risk
and
went
nearby.
but
the
undisputed
and
medical
testimony
is
that
that
was
not
a
desirable
thing
to
do.
and
that
they
--
it
shouldn't
really
be
permitted.
and
here
--
he
apparently
felt,
and
one
of
the
reasons
stated
--
say
there's
no
formal
requirement
here,
that
it's
--
not
even
to
discipline
the
worker.
you
can't
force
them
to
take
a
bath.
you
certainly
can
encourage
them
to
--
encourage
them
to
by
--
by
letting
to
do
it
on
the
company
terms.
and
it
certainly,
there's
enough
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
in
this
circumstance,
this
is
the
--
a
--
a
particularly
strong
circumstance
where
everything
should
be
done
to
encourage
them
to
take
the
--
the
shower
and
to
change
their
clothes.
i
might
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
findings
of
fact
on
the
requirement,
if
time
permits,
to
read
just
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
on
221
(a).
the
court,
despite
of
the
--
the
fact
that
there
was
no
formal
requirement,
the
court
said
that
the
general
requirement
of
bathing
and
clothes
changing
in
storage
battery
plant
is
not
prompted
by
mere
desire
for
cleanliness
or
personal
hygiene.
in
other
words,
it's
not
merely
for
the
convenience
of
the
employees.
those
considerations
apply
to
all
industries.
and
time
spent
for
such
reasons
is
generally
considered
preliminary
and
postliminary
to
actual
working
time.
but
the
changing
and
bathing
required
of
employees
in
a
storage
battery
factory
is
occasioned
by
the
poisonous
substances
used
in
the
manufacturing
process.
and
if,
therefore,
an
integral
part
of
that
process
and
should
be
considered
a
part
of
the
day's
work.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
will
proceed
with
the
next
case
--
