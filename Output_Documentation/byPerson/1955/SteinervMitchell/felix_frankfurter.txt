the

so,
what

you're

out

justice

all
right.
justice

well,
i
can
think
of
several
reasons
why
they
didn't
take
--
they
didn't
take

because
whistle

--
this
what
exclude
something
that
congress
envisaged
to
do
it
from.
and
yet,
they
didn't
want
to
include
that.
justice

well,
here
--
justice

of
course,
the
real
trouble
if
you
and
i
--
well,
i
would
prove
to
you,
but
for
myself
the
real
trouble
is
that
congress
here
passed
the
test
upon
the
court
to
empower
you
their
efforts
of
individual
cases
and
having
some
statements
to
be
determined.

but
all
the

justice

i
don't
think
i
need
to

my
suggestion
because
of
the
thousand
and
one
difference
is
i
don't
think
it
ought
to
be
cast
on
to
the
court,
on
individual
judges
and
individual
courts
of
appeal,
all
of
the
united
states
and
congress
for
a
good
and
sufficient
reason.
i
think
i
can't
think
of
the
right
(inaudible)

to
judges.
justice

(inaudible)
justice

too
much

that's
not
all.
justice
felix

and
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
put
your
words
into
the
statute.
justice

no,
no.
just
what
you've
said?

that
is
