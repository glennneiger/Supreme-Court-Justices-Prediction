mr.
charles
k.
rice
if
the
court
please.
as
mr.
kramer
has
said
there
are
two
questions
in
this
case.
first
is
whether
or
not
certain
transactions
of
the
petitioner
in
commodity
futures
should
be
considered
as
capital
gains
or
income
--
or
losses
or
ordinary
income
or
losses.
and
the
second
question
is
one
which
is
reached
only
if
the
court
decides
the
first
question
adversely
to
the
government
and
that
is
the
point
just
covered
by
mr.
mccain
as
to
whether
or
not
the
transactions
in
question
were
subject
to
the
wash
sales
provisions
of
section
118
of
the
code.
now,
mr.
kramer
has
given
you
the
factual
background
in
this
matter
and
i
think
there
is
not
too
much
dispute
as
to
the
basic
facts
involved.
he
has,
however,
hurried
over
somewhat
the
manner
in
which
this
case
arises
and
because
we
think
the
setting
is
particularly
important
in
this
case
to
an
understanding
of
the
problem.
i
would
to
review
briefly
the
--
the
manner
in
which
the
question
arises.
in
significant
part,
what
we
are
trying
to
determine
here
is
what
were
the
average
annual
earnings
of
this
taxpayer
during
the
so-called
base
period
of
1936
to
1939
which
was
taken
by
congress
as
a
period
of
normal
earnings
for
use
in
the
application
of
the
excess
profits
tax
laws.
now,
the
excess
profits
tax
laws,
i
did
not,
as
your
honors
know,
apply
to
all
earnings
of
a
company
during
the
war.
the
purpose
of
that
act
was
to
capture
those
profits
which
were
in
excess
of
normal
or
average
annual
earnings
during
a
normal
peacetime
period
which
was
--
which
purpose
is
1936
to
1939
was
taken
as
normal.
and
in
excluding
or
in
arriving
at
that
definition
of
average
annual
earnings,
congress
was
seeking
to
limit
the
--
or
to
stabilize
the
earnings
that
the
normal
operating
profit
of
a
corporation
and
to
exclude
from
that
concept
all
things
which
were
abnormal
and
non-recurrent
or
which
were
not
related
to
their
ordinary
business.
and
thus,
as
a
part
of
the
concept,
it
excluded
capital
gains
and
losses.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
taxpayer
is
interested
in
having
this
particular
transactions
treated
as
capital
gains
or
losses
because
for
that
--
for
that
reason
they
would
be
excluded
from
the
computation
of
its
credit
under
the
excess
profits
tax
laws,
and
hence,
less
of
their
income
in
the
wartime
period
would
be
subject
to
excess
profits
taxes.
in
other
words,
if
these
were
not
ordinary
losses
to
be
deducted
from
ordinary
income
of
the
taxpayer
during
the
base
period,
the
taxpayer's
base
period
net
income
is
that
much
higher
and
therefore
it's
credit
when
it
comes
into
the
wartime
excess
profits
tax
period
is
substantially
greater.
but
we
think
that
selling
is
important
because
we
believe
that
congress
in
enacting
the
excess
profits
tax
law
was
seeking
to
exclude
as
a
credit
or
was
seeking
to
allow
as
a
credit
base
only
those
earnings
which
were
normal,
regular
operating
profit
of
the
company.
and
therefore,
when
it
chose
to
eliminate
capital
gains
and
losses
from
the
computation
of
average
annual
earnings,
it
were
doing
so
in
the
belief
that
what
it
was
excluding
was
not
a
normal
part
of
the
business
activity
of
the
particular
taxpayer
and
therefore,
it
shouldn't
be
charged
with
--
with
such
items
as
included
in
their
credit
in
computing
the
excess
profits
tax.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
it's
a
suggestion
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
it's
--
it's
a
suggestion,
your
honor,
that
--
that
congress
thought
of
capital
gains
and
losses
in
the
manner
in
which
we
contend
the
statute
could
be
construed
as
relating
primarily
to
investment
properties
and
not
something
which
is
an
integral
part
of
the
manufacturing
process,
the
integral
part
of
operating
profit
recurring
from
day-to-day
and
from
year-to-year.
it
is
really
a
--
our
argument
here
is
really
a
double
barrel
proposition.
in
other
words,
we
would
contend
for
the
construction
of
section
117
along
the
lines
that
we
do
even
if
there
were
no
question
of
excess
profits
tax
law
involved.
but
as
it
happens,
there
is
a
question
of
excess
profits
tax
law
involved
and
we
believe
that
congress
when
it
took
into
that
law
or
when
it
excluded
under
that
law
capital
gains
and
losses
from
the
determination
of
average
annual
income,
it
was
thinking
of
capital
gains
and
losses
just
as
we
are
thinking
of
them
for
purposes
of
this
particular
case.
now,
as
your
honors
know,
the
outset
of
our
income
tax
laws,
the
capital
gains
were
treated
as
ordinary
income,
capital
gains
and
losses
were
treated
as
ordinary
income
or
losses
in
contradistinction
to
the
british
system
under
which
they
were
not
treated
as
income
at
all.
and
that
created
a
great
deal
of
dissatisfaction
in
this
country
because
it
was
felt
that
capital
gains
were
not
the
same
as
ordinary
income.
they
represented
profit
which
had
been
appreciated
over
a
number
--
period
of
years
and
that
the
taxation
of
capital
gains
and
ordinary
income
rates
was
a
deterrent
to
the
conversion
of
--
of
capital
assets
into
income.
and
so
in
1921,
the
first
capital
gains
law
was
enacted
which
was
a
sort
of
a
compromise
between
the
previous
american
concept
of
them
and
the
british
concept
and
that
they
were
treated
as
a
class
apart,
as
--
as
taxable
but
not
as
taxable
as
the
same
as
ordinary
income
and
special
rates
were
applicable
to
gains
which
fell
in
that
category.
the
definition
of
capital
assets
contained
in
that
law
is,
as
our
brief
points
out,
rather
unique
and
that
it
is
specific
only
in
what
is
excluded
from
the
statute
and
not
as
to
what
is
covered.
it
specifically
excludes
stock
in
trade,
inventory,
property
on
hand
primarily
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
force
of
trade
or
business
and
depreciable
property
used
in
the
trade
or
business.
now,
it
was
early
recognized
by
this
court
and
by
others
that
this
definition
of
capital
assets
and
the
granting
of
capital
gain
or
a
preferential
capital
gain
treatment
was
to
be
given
a
strict
construction.
this
court
had
the
question
before
it
in
20
or
more
years
ago
when
burnet
against
harmel,
which
the
question
was
as
to
the
status
of
royalties
and
bonuses
received
in
the
sale
of
oil
leases.
and
there
it
was
contended
that
the
oil
leases
were
property
and
that
they
didn't
fall
within
any
of
the
four
exceptions
here
and
that
the
income
received
by
the
lessor
must
constitute
capital
gain
to
him.
and
this
court
in
reviewing
the
history
of
the
capital
gains
taxation
found
that
it
wasn't
the
sort
of
thing
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
were
granting
this
preferential
treatment,
that
it
was
not
the
sort
of
hardship
that
congress
was
seeking
to
avoid
when
they
enacted
the
capital
gains
law.
there
wasn't
in
that
case
any
particular
transaction
such
as
you
have
in
the
normal
sale,
any
one
isolated
transactions
such
as
you
have
in
a
normal
sale
or
exchange.
and
the
--
though
the
title
to
the
gas
or
oil
might
have
passed
as
result
of
the
lease,
it
was
but
an
incident
of
the
manufacturing
operation.
and
consequently,
although
the
--
a
literal
application
of
the
statute
might
have
produced
a
favorable
result
for
the
taxpayer,
this
court
held
that
--
to
hold
that
the
taxpayer
was
entitled
to
capital
gains
treatment
would
defeat,
rather
than
further,
the
purpose
of
the
act.
and
so
in
subsequent
decisions,
both
here
and
in
the
courts
below,
there
have
been
numerous
cases
in
which
superficially
the
transaction
in
question
appeared
to
qualify
for
capital
gains
treatment.
but
the
court
involved
found
that
it
wasn't
the
sort
of
thing
that
congress
had
in
mind
and
it
didn't
represent
an
appreciation
of
profit
over
substantial
period
of
years
and
that
to
permit
that
kind
of
preferential
treatment,
it
would
not
be
in
accord
with
the
--
with
the
spirit
of
the
act.
we've
had
it
in
the
case
of
--
of
payments
as
a
part
of
a
lump
sum
condemnation
award
which
represented
compensation
for
the
delay
in
the
--
in
the
payment.
you
had
it
in
the
case
--
in
this
court
in
the
case
of
lump
sums
paid
in
the
cancellation
of
a
lease
and
we
have
had
it
in
court
--
in
the
courts
below
in
connection
with
the
sale
of
rights
to
receive
a
legal
fee
for
past
due
services
or
sale
of
bond
interest
overdue.
and
then
in
a
variety
of
other
circumstances,
we
have
had
situations
which
if
you
gave
the
statute
a
literal
application
to
follow
the
language
with
federal
fidelity,
you
would've
arrived
at
a
result
in
favor
of
the
capital
gains
treatment.
and
then
again,
we
have
another
series
of
cases
in
the
circuit
courts
in
which
the
courts
have
held
that
the
profits
involved
were
directly
related
to
the
manufacturing
or
--
or
business
operations
of
the
taxpayer
in
such
a
way
that
congress
couldn't
be
deemed
to
have
intended
that
they
should
receive
the
preferential
treatment
granted
to
capital
gains.
only
recently
in
the
second
circuit,
in
the
bagley
&
sewall
case,
the
taxpayer
under
a
contract
for
the
government
of
finland
for
the
manufacture
of
paper
equipment
was
required
to
purchase
a
very
large
amount
of
government
bonds,
place
them
in
escrow
for
the
performance
of
the
contract.
it
didn't
have
any
bonds
on
hand
and
it
had
to
borrow
the
money
with
which
to
buy
the
bonds
and
when
the
contract
was
performed
satisfactorily
and
the
bonds
could
be
released
from
escrow
where
they
were
sold
at
a
loss,
which
the
taxpayer
claimed
it
was
an
ordinary
loss
being
intimately
connected
with
its
business
operation.
and
in
that
case,
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
property
in
question
couldn't
be
divorced
from
its
background
or
from
the
nature
of
the
contract
pursuant
to
which
it
was
bought
and
that
the
reason
for
which
it
was
bought
was
a
business
reason.
and
that
therefore,
it
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
--
in
setting
up
the
--
a
favored
capital
gains
treatment,
so
the
ordinary
loss
was
allowed.
we've
had
the
same
sort
of
thing
in
the
liquor
stock
cases
where
to
obtain
purchase
of
liquor
in
favorable
terms.
taxpayers
have
purchased
the
stock
from
companies
so
that
they
could
get
the
rights
to
buy
the
liquor.
and
thereafter,
sold
the
stock
at
a
loss
and
has
been
allowed
ordinary
losses
because
again,
the
--
the
purchase
of
the
loss
was
a
part
of
their
normal
recurring
day-to-day
business
activity.
and
so
again,
we
have
had
it
in
the
case
of
the
purchase
of
the
stock
of
a
company
in
order
to
get
out
of
an
unfavorable
contract
which
the
taxpayer
--
the
purchaser-taxpayer
have.
and
there
again,
it
was
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
transaction
was
so
intimately
connected
with
the
normal
business
with
the
operating
activity
of
the
purchaser
that
should
be
treated
as
an
ordinary
loss
and
not
a
capital
loss.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
no,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
to
the
theory
of
our
case,
your
honor.
so
with
that
background
seeing
as
we
do
that
the
--
the
capital
gains
statute
is
not
to
be
applied
literally
and
--
and
so
to
speak
in
vacuo
without
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case,
we
turn
to
the
hedging
exception.
now,
the
hedging
exception
as
mr.
kramer
or
the
hedging
question
as
mr.
kramer
pointed
out,
it
didn't
become
significant
in
the
earlier
revenue
acts
because
under
those
acts,
the
capital
asset
had
to
be
one
which
was
held
for
two
years
or
more
or
as
by
definition,
the
commodity
futures
are
held
for
a
substantially
lesser
period
than
that,
less
than
a
year.
but
in
1934,
when
that
two-year
limitation
was
taken
off
the
statute,
the
question
did
become
important.
and
in
1936,
the
treasury
department
issued
its
general
counsel's
memorandum
which
mr.
kramer
referred
to
and
which
is
the
--
the
background
--
furnishes
the
background
for
most
of
the
litigation
as
followed.
and
in
that
general
counsel's
memorandum,
the
treasury
said
as
follows,
"such
hedges
which
eliminates
speculative
risks
due
to
fluctuations
in
the
market
price
of
cotton
and
therefore
tend
to
assure
ordinary
operating
profits
are
common
trade
practices
and
are
generally
regarded
as
a
form
of
insurance.
the
only
kind
available
as
protection
against
such
risks
necessary
to
conservative
business
operation,
where
future
contracts
are
entered
into
only
to
ensure
against
the
above
mentioned
risks
inherent
from
the
taxpayers
business.
the
hedging
operations
should
be
recognized
as
a
legitimate
form
of
business
insurance,
as
such,
the
cost
thereof
which
includes
losses
sustained
therein
is
an
ordinary
and
necessary
expense
deductible
under
section
23
(a)
of
the
revenue
act
of
1934
and
corresponding
provisions
of
prior
revenue
acts."
well,
that
general
counsel's
memorandum
laid
down
the
general
principle
that
those
hedges
which
were
a
form
of
price
protection
and
--
or
a
form
of
price
insurance
were
to
be
regarded
as
regular
business
practices
of
the
taxpayer
and
not
to
qualify
for
capital
gains
treatment.
now,
this
rule
which
was
laid
down
in
the
general
counsel's
memorandum
has
been
on
the
books
ever
since
1936,
nearly
20
years
and
never,
as
far
as
i
know
prior
to
this
case,
has
it
been
challenged.
now,
there
have
been
--
there
has
been
litigation
in
the
lower
courts
involving
the
application
of
the
principle
and
in
particular
cases,
it
was
contended
that
the
transactions
involved
there
either
were
or
weren't
price
insurance
and
that
they
were
or
weren't
speculation
or
exchange
of
risks
or
something
other
than
hedging.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
the
evidence
is
largely
factual,
your
honor.
is
that
what
you
had
in
mind?
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
particular
person
or
company
is
protecting
itself
against
fluctuations
in
the
market,
against
the
rise
and
fall
of
prices.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
no
--
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
the
basis
of
proof
is
whether
or
not
they
were
guarding
themselves
against
rises
in
the
--
in
this
case
and
rises
against
in
the
prices
of
corn.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
it
would
be
offered
by
the
testimony
of
--
of
the
company's
officials
as
to
why
the
--
pardon?
mr.
charles
k.
rice
as
to
why
they
purchased
it.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
as
to
why
they
purchased
it
and
by
relevant
statistics
as
to
fluctuations
in
the
price
which
occurred
then
and
which
had
--
had
them
occurring
previously
and
technical
testimony
of
that
nature.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
it's
a
question
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
it's
a
question
primarily
a
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
they
were
guarding
themselves
against
price
changes
that
would
be
adverse
to
them.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well
--
and
we
rely
on
the
decisions
holding
that
whether
there's
been
a
settled
administrative
practice,
the
--
the
courts
will
accept
that
practice
where
congress
has
reenacted
the
law
numerous
times
in
the
phase
of
that
settled
administrative
practice.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
general
counsel's
memorandum
doesn't
have
the
force
of
a
treasury
regulation,
but
it
--
it
has
established
a
--
a
settled
administrative
pattern
which
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
an
answer
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
i
don't
think
an
answer
could
be
given
which
would
cover
all
of
the
reasons
or
all
of
the
situations
in
which
questions
become
part
of
the
treasury
regulations
and
--
and
those
which
haven't.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
i
think
that's
probably
it.
now,
as
i
said
there
has
been
litigation
in
the
courts
as
to
the
application
of
the
rule
but
never
until
now
has
this
rule
itself
had
been
challenged.
and
referring
to
the
canon
of
construction
which
i
just
recited,
namely,
that
where
a
settled
administrative
practice
is
then
inherent
to
for
many
years
and
congress
has
as
it
has
here
reenacted
the
internal
revenue
code
several
times
during
that
period.
the
courts
will
recognize
that
as
indicative
of
the
congressional
will.
now,
we
have
more
than
that
in
this
particular
case
because
in
1954,
in
the
new
internal
revenue
code,
when
congress
was
amending
the
provisions
in
regard
to
short
sales
of
property,
it
--
it
provided
that
gain
or
loss
in
the
short
sale
of
property
other
than
a
hedging
transaction
in
commodity
futures
is
to
be
treated
as
a
gain
or
loss
from
a
sale
of
a
capital
asset
to
the
extent
that
the
property
including
a
commodity
future
used
to
close
the
short
sale
constitutes
a
capital
asset
in
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer.
and
in
the
committee
report
with
respect
to
that
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that's
1233
(a)
of
the
1954
code.
in
the
committee
report
with
respect
to
that
section,
it
was
said
that
under
existing
law
of
bona
fide
hedging
transactions
do
not
result
from
capital
gains
or
losses.
this
result
is
based
upon
case
law
and
regulations.
to
continue
this
result
hedging
transactions
in
commodity
futures
have
been
specifically
excepted
from
the
operation
of
this
subsection.
so
there
we
have
a
recognition,
after
some
20
years
of
experience,
20
years
that
the
problem
existed,
by
congress
that
that
had
been
the
law
all
the
time.
in
other
words,
that
short
sales
do
not
--
that
hedging
transactions
do
not
result
from
capital
gains
and
losses.
now,
on
this
particular
case,
the
petitioner
which
was
one
of
the
largest
consumers
of
corn,
if
not,
the
largest
in
the
united
states
had,
as
the
record
shows,
a
twin
purpose
in
--
in
the
purchase
of
corn
futures.
they
wanted
to
--
it
had
a
limited
as
mr.
kramer
pointed
out,
a
limited
storage
capacity
something
like
three-week
supply
and
it
wanted
to
assure
itself
without
the
expense
of
additional
storage
facilities
which
they
--
the
petitioner's
officials
testified
would
be
very
expensive.
it
wanted
to
assure
itself
of
a
satisfactory
supply
of
corn
to
meet
its
requirements.
and
at
the
same
time,
it
wanted
to
guard
against
rises
in
the
price
of
corn
when
it
came
to
honor
it's
--
or
to
carry
out
its
contracts.
now,
its
contracts
were
entered
into
on
either
the
basis
of
the
contract
price
or
the
market
price,
the
lower
of
those
two
would
prevail,
so
that
the
taxpayer
in
this
particular
case
was
seeking
by
the
purchase
of
these
commodity
futures
to
protect
itself
against
increases
in
the
price
of
--
of
the
raw
corn
which
might
occur
during
the
time
that
it
was
necessary
to
manufacture
the
product
and
deliver
it
to
the
customer
to
whom
it
had
a
contract.
now,
we
have
in
this
case
--
we
do
not
have,
well,
the
so-called
true
hedge
and
that
the
--
there
is
not
protection
against
both
a
rise
and
a
fall
in
--
in
the
price
of
corn,
the
protection
only
against
the
rise
in
the
price
of
a
corn.
but
that
was
a
result
of
the
taxpayers
of
the
type
of
contract
for
which
it
entered
into
with
its
customers.
in
other
words,
those
in
which
they
--
the
customer
could
have
the
benefit
of
either
the
market
price
or
the
contract
price
at
the
date
of
delivery.
so
that
in
effecting
this
form
of
price
insurance,
it
is
true
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
complete
insurance.
it
didn't
have
the
--
what
is
sometimes,
i
think
perhaps
unfortunately
referred
to
as
the
true
hedge
which
would
be
a
hedge
against
either
a
rise
or
a
fall
in
the
price
of
the
commodity.
but
the
true
--
the
term
true
hedge
is
we
think
somewhat
misleading,
it
connotes
as
it's
opposite
the
false
hedge
or
some
hedge
which
other
than
a
partial
or
incomplete
one
such
as
we
have
here.
the
--
a
more
correct
terminology
i
think
would
be
a
--
a
complete
hedge
in
which
the
hedge
guarded
against
a
rise
or
a
fall
in
the
price
of
--
of
goods
or
a
partial
or
incomplete
hedge
such
as
we
have
here
where
the
protection
was
only
against
the
rise
in
the
price
of
the
goods.
but
it
is
our
position,
nevertheless,
that
--
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
hedge
is
complete
or
partial
as
long
--
as
long
as
it
forms
--
as
long
as
it
performs
the
function
of
price
insurance.
now,
the
taxpayer
here
got
all
the
protection
that
it
was
able
to
get
under
the
formal
contract
which
it
utilized.
it's
true
that
it
didn't
get
--
it
didn't
get
the
protection
of
a
complete
hedge
but
that
was
impossible
under
the
nature
of
its
contract,
so
that
to
say
that
it
is
not
a
hedge
merely
because
it
did
not
guard
against
any
--
every
possible
loss.
it
would
be
like
saying
that
insurance,
which
guarded
against
only
the
risks
of
--
of
fire
and
tornado
and
not
against
hurricane
was
not
insurance
because
it
was
not
complete
insurance.
and
so
here,
the
--
the
hedge
guarded
against
or
was
partial
insurance
and
we
think
that
was
--
that
that
is
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
hedging
exception.
in
a
case
of
this
magnitude
where
the
taxpayer
was
dealing
in
such
vast
quantities
of
corn,
it's
impossible
of
course
to
match
item
per
item
to
prove
that
for
every
purchase
of
a
commodity
future,
the
taxpayer
had
a
corresponding
commitment
for
a
forward
sale.
but
when
you
compare
the
orders
which
the
taxpayer
had
and
the
futures
which
it
bought,
we
submit
that
there
is
a
broad
correspondence
between
its
orders
and
futures
particularly
for
the
years
1940
and
1942
which
are
the
tax
years
here
involved.
and
in
any
event,
the
testimony
of
the
court
below
or
in
the
court
below
was
--
by
the
taxpayer's
own
officers
was
to
the
effect
that
we
need
the
corn
that
we
have
bought.
and
in
--
and
in
the
proceeding
under
the
--
before
the
department
of
agriculture
involving
the
commodity
exchange
act,
it
stated
that
the
futures
it
bought
represented
only
corn
which
was
expected
to
use
within
a
relatively
short
period.
in
other
words,
it
forecast
what
its
business
would
be
and
bought
futures
of
corn
accordingly.
the
taxpayers
has
put
considerable
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
its
customers
had
the
right
to
cancel
contracts
if
they
so
desire.
and
to
us
that
feature
is
of
no
great
significance
here
because
that
right
of
cancellation
was
in
the
opposite
party
and
if
it
were
to
the
other
party's
advantage,
the
price
of
corn
should
rise,
it
would
be
to
the
other
party's
advantage
to
exercise
their
--
to
hold
the
taxpayer
to
its
contract
so
that
we
don't
--
do
not
see
that
that
particular
feature
has
any
significance
here.
in
the
--
it
is
our
position
that
essentially
this
is
a
factual
question
which
in
this
case
has
been
resolved
against
the
taxpayer
by
concurrent
findings
of
the
two
courts
below
in
which
under
the
principles
laid
down
by
this
court
will
be
accepted
as
final
here
except
in
the
case
of
showing
of
exceptional
error.
now,
there
are
various
definitions
of
the
term
hedging
but
one
thing
is
basic
to
it
and
that
is
that
in
some
way
it
guards
against
--
gives
protection
against
price
fluctuations.
accepting
that
general
principle,
you
can
find
variations
which
range
from
the
--
from
the
broad
definition
in
the
new
york
commodity
exchange
market
in
which
it
is
indicated
clearly
that
commodity
futures
purchased
in
anticipation
of
sales,
believed
regarded
as
hedging,
to
a
narrow
and
restricted
definition
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
where
the
purpose
being
to
guard
against
unnecessary
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
commodities,
hedging
is
very,
very
strictly
construed.
for
purposes
of
the
tax
laws,
bearing
in
mind
what
congress
had
intended
with
respect
to
the
capital
--
favored
capital
gains
treatment
and
bearing
in
mind
the
particular
background
of
this
case
and
which
we're
trying
to
determine
what
earnings
would
be
normal
to
this
taxpayer,
we
think
that
the
hedging
exception
should
be
given
a
broad
and
wide
definition.
in
other
words,
it
should
not
be
restricted
as
in
the
manner
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
but
should
be
considered
to
cover
all
transactions
in
which
there
is
some
form
of
insurance
prices,
whether
it
be
complete
or
whether
it
should
be
partial.
a
taxpayer
in
this
proceeding
is
in
a
particularly
awkward
position
for
the
reason
that
in
this
court,
it
is
contending
that
its
transactions
are
those
of
a
--
the
so-called
independent
capitalist,
whatever
that
maybe.
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
proceeding
before
the
department
of
agriculture,
it
is
contending
that
the
--
that
it
is
engaging
in
hedging
transactions
so
that
--
while
here
it
contends
that
it
is
not
hedging
and
that
its
transactions
were
those
of
an
independent
capitalist
in
the
agriculture
proceeding.
it
is
contending
that
it
didn't
buy
futures
in
excess
of
what
it
estimated
its
needs
would
be.
they
have
the
technique
to
forecast
what
its
needs
would
be
and
that
purchases
of
futures
of
that
kind
were
hedges
against
possible
price
increases.
so
in
--
in
conclusion
of
this
point,
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
turns
not
on
any
precise
definition
of
hedging
but
on
the
meaning
of
--
of
the
capital
gains
transactions
and
the
tax
laws,
particularly
with
the
background
of
the
excess
profits
tax
laws
which
are
involved
here.
we
believe
that
these
--
that
these
transactions
were
an
integral
part
of
the
normal
day-to-day
business
of
the
taxpayer
that
they
form
part
of
their
operating
profits
and
losses
that
they
would
not
be
considered
among
the
class
of
property
which
congress
would
intend
to
exclude
from
the
definition
of
capital
assets.
and
that
when
the
congress
enacted
the
excess
profits
tax
law
and
excluded
capital
assets
from
the
definition
or
from
the
computation
of
average
annual
earnings,
it
had
no
idea
that
it
was
excluding
computation
of
losses
of
this
sort
from
the
average
annual
earnings
of
the
taxpayer.
now,
the
second
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
--
and
this
question
is
reached
only
if
the
first
question
is
decided
adversely
to
the
government.
the
second
question
is
whether
or
not
the
--
the
transactions
here
in
question
fall
within
section
118
of
the
code
relating
to
the
wash
sales
provisions.
and
the
first
question
there
is
whether
or
not
these
commodity
futures
constitute
stock
or
securities
within
the
meaning
of
that
section.
and
first
of
all,
we
point
out
that
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
congress
has
referred
to
stock
or
securities
a
half
a
dozen
times
in
various
contexts
throughout
the
statute
and
in
none
of
those
instances
were
it
has
used
the
terms
stock
and
securities
or
securities
alone
as
it
included
commodity
futures
within
the
definition
of
the
term
commodity
--
within
the
definition
of
the
term
securities.
on
the
other
hand
and
then
several
instances
within
the
code
and
the
citations
to
these
sections
are
in
the
briefs,
it
has
specifically
referred
to
commodity
futures.
for
example,
in
the
definition
of
personal
holding
company
income
and
foreign
personal
holding
company
income,
it
refers
to
stock
and
securities
in
--
as
one
type
of
personal
holding
company
income.
and
then
it
refers
to
income
from
transactions
in
commodity
futures
as
another
type
of
personal
holding
company
income.
so
that
the
history
of
the
code
shows
that
congress
when
it
has
intended
to
include
commodity
futures,
it
has
specifically
referred
to
them.
it
has
not
included
them
in
its
definitions
of
stock
and
securities
where
it
used
elsewhere
within
the
code.
we
find
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
--
in
the
trade
practice
in
the
chicago
board
of
trade,
the
rules
and
regulations
also
distinguished
between
stock
and
securities
on
the
one
hand
and
commodity
transactions
on
the
other.
there
are
differences
as
to
commissions
and
brokerage
fees
and
the
places
in
the
pit
where
the
transactions
must
take
place
and
so
forth.all
of
which
we
think
tends
to
emphasize
that
in
using
the
word
stock
--
word
stock
or
securities,
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
the
commodity
futures.
the
committee
reports
under
section
118
are
completely
silent
as
to
any
intention
to
cover
commodity
futures
and
the
words
throughout
those
reports,
the
word
stock
and
securities
are
used
interchangeably
so
that
we
think
that
it's
clear
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
the
ordinary
shares
of
stock
and
notes,
bonds,
the
ventures
and
other
evidences
of
indebtedness
and
not
commodity
futures.
in
addition
to
those
matters
of
statutory
construction,
we
think
that
commodity
futures
of
such
a
nature
that
they
do
not
--
lend
themselves
to
evil
which
congress
was
intending
to
prevent
in
section
118.
they
are
held
for
a
short
duration,
11
months
or
less
whereas
with
your
ordinary
stocks
and
securities,
it's
possible
to
build
up
a
portfolio
of
gains
over
a
substantial
period
of
time
and
then
section
118
more
than
in
existence
to
make
some
sales
at
a
loss,
buy
back
the
securities
in
short
time
and
thereby
establish
a
fictitious
loss
which
could
be
used
to
offset
against
the
gains.
the
commodity
futures
transaction
are
of
a
different
nature
because
it's
a
recurring
process
with
the
futures,
a
very
short
duration
in
the
process
or
working
forward
in
the
market
and
via
selling
futures
and
buying
new
ones,
delivery
at
a
later
date
to
replace
the
ones
sold.
furthermore,
as
the
record
indicates
below,
it
would
be
a
costly
operation
to
--
to
engage
in
transactions
of
this
nature
solely
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
tax
law
--
tax
losses.
and
then
again
if
section
118
applied
in
this
situation
where
the
hedgers
are
working
forward
continually
in
the
market
selling
and
buying
and
buying
and
selling,
it
would
mean
in
many
situations
that
the
computation
of
any
gain
or
loss
would
be
postponed
indefinitely,
perhaps
several
years
as
--
as
the
new
commodity
futures
were
purchased
to
replace
those
sold
and
this
is
contrary
to
the
general
principles
of
tax
accounting
that
transactions
are
to
be
accounted
for
in
the
year
in
which
they
took
place.
in
view
of
the
statutory
construction
and
these
practical
principals
which
illustrate
that
the
reasons
were
not
present
in
the
case
of
commodity
futures,
which
were
present
in
the
case
of
stocks
and
securities,
we
believe
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
commodity
futures
within
the
meaning
of
the
term
stock
--
stock
and
securities.
there
is
another
reason,
a
separate
and
independent
reason
why
commodity
futures
are
not
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
118
and
that
is
that
the
commodity
futures
--
that
the
purchase
of
another
commodity
future
is
not
substantially
identical
to
the
one
which
it
replaces.
you
have
differences
as
to
seller,
as
to
price,
as
to
delivery
date
and
--
and
these
commodity
futures,
the
seller
has
the
right
with
a
certain
price
adjustment
to
make
a
delivery
of
a
different
grade
commodity
so
that
the
commodity
future
may
result
in
the
delivery
of
even
a
different
grade
than
that
contemplated
in
the
future
just
sold.
the
delivery
date,
of
course,
the
difference
in
the
delivery
date
is
the
most
important
feature
indicating
that
they
are
not
substantially
identical
because
delivery
dates
are
the
keystone
of
the
futures
transaction,
the
most
important,
probably
the
most
important
feature
of
them
and
the
differences
in
those
dates
we
think
alone
may
prevent
them
--
prevent
a
new
one
from
being
substantially
identical
to
the
one
sold.
congress
has
recognized
this
when
in
the
revenue
act
of
1950
in
section
211
in
determining
the
holding
period
of
short
sales.
it
specifically
provided
that
a
commodity
future
requiring
delivery
in
one
calendar
month
shall
not
be
considered
as
property
--
property
substantially
identical
to
another
commodity
future
requiring
delivery
in
a
different
calendar
month.
so
there
we
have
the
congressional
recognition
that
one
--
that
a
commodity
future
requiring
delivery
in
--
in
a
different
month
is
not
substantially
identical
with
the
commodity
future
sold.
furthermore
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
that's
at
page
49
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
furthermore,
as
our
brief
indicates,
there
are
important
price
differentials
or
have
been
in
the
commodity
markets.
we
give
an
illustration
of
that
at
page
50
of
our
brief,
which
refute
the
taxpayer
contention
that
there
is
only
a
small
economic
difference
in
the
value
of
the
different
maturities.
and
finally
under
--
in
connection
with
this
point,
the
--
we
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
commodity
exchange
act
itself
prevents
the
--
prevents
or
prohibits
wash
or
fictitious
sales.
and
while
the
petitioner
has
made
some
attempt
to
indicate
that
the
sales
under
the
tax
laws
is
referred
to
as
wash
sales
are
real
sales
whereas
the
--
those
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
are
fictitious
sales.
actually,
the
reason
that
the
loss
is
disallowed
under
the
tax
laws
is
because
there
is
no
economic
change.there
is
no
--
no
real
sale
under
--
under
those
laws
either.
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
to
be
assumed
that
the
taxpayer
was
conducting
transactions
here
in
violation
of
the
commodity
exchange
act.
in
connection
with
the
taxpayer's
chart
or
graph,
which
it
has
in
its
brief
and
is
blown
up
as
an
exhibit
here,
we
would
like
to
call
attention
to
our
own
chart
appearing
at
the
--
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
in
which
--
which
we
believe
gives
a
more
accurate
picture
of
the
situation
as
it
existed
during
the
years
in
question.
the
taxpayer's
chart
is
pyramided
in
one
category
upon
another
whereas
ours
has
leveled
them
out
and
we
think
that
from
this
chart
--
chart
number
one
of
ours,
it
is
possible
to
gain
a
more
accurate
picture
of
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
the
years
in
question.
we
also
have
added
a
chart
two
showing
a
comparison
between
futures
owned
and
the
carry
over
in
the
terminal
market,
which
was
the
amount
of
corn
which
was
available
for
--
for
commercial
consumption.
in
other
words,
what
the
--
the
amount
of
corn
which
the
taxpayer
was
able
to
buy
at
any
particular
time.
so
in
summary
of
our
position
here
with
respect
to
the
--
to
the
first
point,
we
contend
that
the
transactions
in
question
fall
within
the
hedging
exception
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
then
first
of
all
that
the
capital
asset
statute
is
not
to
be
read
as
the
taxpayer
would
have
us
do
with
a
literal
exactness
and
without
regard
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
circumstance
or
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
congress
intended
to
cover
a
particular
type
of
hardship
in
enacting
this
act.
mr.
charles
k.
rice
there
--
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
literally
expressed,
your
honor.
that
--
that's
the
point
i'm
making
that
--
that
over
the
years
in
--
in
different
circumstances,
the
statute
has
been
read
as
--
as
not
to
be
taken
entirely
literally.
and
this
court
beginning
in
burnet
against
harmel
and
running
on
through
many
decisions
in
the
--
in
the
lower
courts,
there
have
been
decisions
--
mr.
charles
k.
rice
well,
i
--
i
refer
to
a
hedging
exception
as
one
established
by
administrative
construction
and
by
judicial
precedent.
we
contend
that
there
is
in
this
case
--
are
in
this
case
the
elements
of
a
hedge
of
--
of
price
protection
against
price
increases.
but
that
was
the
only
form
of
protection
which
under
the
particular
type
of
contract
in
which
the
taxpayer
engaged,
but
the
only
type
of
protection
which
was
available
to
the
taxpayer.
thereby,
achieved
a
form
of
partial
insurance
which
comes
within
the
hedging
exception
and
that
this
was
so
integrated
to
its
business
form,
so
normal
a
part
of
its
business
that
it
should
be
held
to
be
an
exception
to
the
capital
gains
statute.
and
on
the
second
point,
we
contend
both
that
the
commodity
futures
were
not
stock
and
--
or
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
that
they
were
not
--
those
purchased
were
not
substantially
identical
to
those
sold
and
therefore
do
not
come
within
the
wash
sales
of
the
act.
