mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
if
this
--
if
this
court
determines
that
any
other
corn
futures
transactions
in
this
case,
other
transaction
from
this
--
this
long
futures
position
are
capital
asset
transactions
then
this
court
has
before
it
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
section
118
of
the
revenue
code
is
applicable
where
petitioner
sold
the
corn
future
of
one
maturity
and
purchased
a
corn
future
of
a
later
maturity.
petitioner
has
a
support
of
a
direct
holding
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
and
section
118
is
applicable
to
the
sale
of
a
commodity
future
and
the
contemporaneous
purchase
of
a
later
maturity.
this
is
in
the
case
of
trenton
cotton
oil
co.
v.
commissioner,
reported
in
147
f.2d
33.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
a
dictum,
not
necessary
to
the
decision,
stated
we
find
ourselves
unable
to
agree
with
that
decision,
referring
to
the
trenton
cotton
oil
case.
that's
in
the
record
at
page
297.
the
issue
turns
mainly
on
whether
corn
futures
contracts
are
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
118
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
irrelevant
portion
of
which
reads
as
follows,
this
is
at
page
68
of
our
main
brief,
section
118
loss
from
wash
sales
of
stock
or
securities.
in
the
case
of
any
loss
claimed
to
have
been
sustained
from
any
sale
or
other
disposition
of
shares
of
stock
or
securities
where
it
appears
that
within
a
period
of
30
days
before
the
date
of
such
sale
or
disposition
and
ending
30
days
after
such
date,
the
taxpayer
has
acquired
substantially
identical
stock
or
securities,
then
no
deduction
for
the
loss
shall
be
allowed
under,
in
this
case,
section
23
(l).
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
the
corn
futures
contract
is
a
document
and
the
contract
as
exhibit
14
reproduced
at
page
151
of
the
record,
evidencing
an
agreement
to
buy
5000
bushels
of
corn
or
some
multiple
thereof
at
a
stated
price
upon
delivery
during
a
stated
month.
the
record
shows
that
large
numbers
of
these
contracts
were
outstanding.
petitioner
alone
purchased
824
contracts
calling
for
over
19
million
bushels
of
corn
in
1938
and
593
contracts
calling
for
about
14.5
million
bushels
in
1939.
this
appears
in
the
record
at
page
37.
mr.
dobie
henry,
a
member
of
the
board
of
trade
of
chicago
testified,
at
pages
90
and
91
and
94
of
the
record,
as
to
the
character
of
corn
futures
contracts.
all
these
contracts
are
identical
in
a
wording,
differing
only
as
to
maturity
date,
price
and
quality
and
the
quantity
is
always
a
multiple
of
5000
bushels.
contracts
are
traded
regularly
on
the
chicago
board
of
trade
being
fully
negotiable
and
transferable.
there
is
no
essential
difference
in
the
trading
of
stock
and
bonds
and
in
the
trading
of
futures
contracts.
now,
this
court
in
the
case
of
s.
e.
c.
against
joiner
corporation,
reported
at
320
u.s.344,
looked
particularly
at
the
fact
that
the
documents
there
before
the
court
which
incidentally
were
leases
of
particular
pieces
of
real
estate
that
mineral
leases
are
the
particular
pieces
of
real
estate,
whether
the
documents
were
widely
offered
or
dealt
in
on
their
terms
or
in
a
course
of
dealing
which
established
their
character
as
securities.
now,
we
contend
here
that
the
--
that
the
course
of
dealing
the
characteristics
of
the
--
of
a
corn
futures
do
establish
them
as
security.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
was
in
the
words
of
the
committee
reports
of
both
houses
of
congress
to
prevent
evasion,
that's
what
they
said,
of
taxes
by
taking
of
losses
where
the
economic
position
of
the
taxpayer
was
not
altered.
now,
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
having
in
mind
this
--
this
purpose
of
congress
adopted
the
definition
in
webster's
new
international
dictionary
of
securities
as
applicable
in
the
case
of
commodity
futures.
this
definition
is
that
a
security
is
an
evidence
of
debt
or
a
property
as
a
bond,
stock,
certificate
or
other
instrument,
etc.,
a
document
giving
the
right
to
demand
and
receive
property
not
in
his
possession.
that
court
then
held
that
when
the
taxpayer
had
the
court
--
the
cottonseed
oil
future
yet
in
the
words
of
the
court,
it
had
no
more
than
a
document
giving
it
the
right
to
demand
and
receive
property
not
in
its
possession.
this,
said
the
court,
is
a
security.
he
went
on
to
say
that
unless
commodity
futures
losses
are
within
the
statute,
the
bearing
under
the
statute
has
weakened
pointing
out
that
commodity
dealings
are
almost
as
extensive
as
dealings
in
stocks
and
bonds.
the
government
argues
first
that
securities
mean
corporate
securities
because
in
most
of
the
definitions
in
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
subject
matter
is
only
corporate
securities.we
submit
that
this
argument
has
no
weight
in
view
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
it's
this
court
to
look
at.
the
government
also
argues
that
the
ordinary
dictionary
definition
is
an
unusual
meaning
to
give
the
word
securities.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
that
the
statement
of
this
proposition
has
its
own
answer.
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
designed
to
protect
the
revenue
and
if
the
government's
position
is
sustained,
it
will
mean
a
loss
of
revenue.
the
real
question
was,
was
it
congress'
intention
to
close
the
loophole
only
partly
as
to
corporate
stocks
and
bonds
or
did
it
mean
to
close
the
loophole
entirely
as
to
all
securities
regularly
traded
including
commodity
futures?
we
think
the
answer
is
clear.
the
only
other
issue
involved
under
section
118
is
whether
a
futures
contract
of
one
maturity
is
substantially
identical
to
a
succeeding
maturity.
the
wording
of
the
contracts
is
identical
which
appear
at
the
record
90.
normally,
the
only
difference
in
--
in
price
between
a
future
of
one
maturity
and
the
next
succeeding
maturity
is
the
cost
to
a
storage
of
corn.
it
appears
in
the
record
at
page
51
and
this
is
around
one-and-a-half
cents
of
bushel
a
month
for
the
intervening
months.
this
is
not
really
an
economic
difference.
if
--
if
the
buyer
took
delivery
on
his
future
of
one
maturity
and
held
the
product
until
the
next
maturity,
assuming
that's
when
he
was
going
to
use
it,
he
would
have
that
storage
expense
so
that
his
economic
position
on
one
maturity
is
really,
we
say,
substantially
identical
to
his
position
on
a
--
on
the
next
succeeding
maturity.
mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
yes,
sir,
in
general.
now,
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
that
we
did
take
delivery
on
the
actual
corn
on
some
of
these
futures
and
of
course
that
one
entire
inventory
at
--
that's
what
we
paid
for
it.
but
as
a
general
rule,
the
futures
were
disposed
of
and
a
--
and
a
subsequent
maturity
bought
or
the
futures
were
disposed
of
and
cached
corn
was
bought
at
--
at
the
same
time.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
on
a
corn
future,
any
--
any
grade
of
corn
can
be
delivered
as
a
--
as
a
--
declare
a
different
price.
mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
that's
what
we
contend,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
that
you're
buying
substantially
identical
appliance.
that
the
september
is
--
mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
even
though
the
--
the
delivery
date
is
different.
mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
our
contention
is
that
that's
substantially
identical
property.
in
other
words,
and
that's
reflected
the
economics.
the
finding
i
think
is
reflected
in
the
prices.
the
price
say
on
august
to
the
september
future
will
be
--
mr.
samuel
a.
mccain
the
only
difference
between
the
september
and
the
december
is
--
is
the
--
is
the
storage.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
those
prices,
the
government
has
set
them
forth
at
page
50
of
its
brief
and
i
think
that
makes
it
clear
that
economically
there's
not
--
not
any
difference
to
speak
of.
there
is
just
one
other
point
--
there
is
just
one
other
point
in
the
government's
brief
that
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
discuss
and
that
is
where
the
government
attempts
to
identify
wash
sales
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
with
wash
sales
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
now,
wash
sale
is
known
for
trade
under
the
commodity
exchange
act,
it's
a
fictitious
sale.
for
instance,
in
the
case
where
a
person
sells
through
one
broker
and
buys
from
himself
through
another
broker
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
published
quotation
as
he
may
use
to
a
regular
market.
of
course,
there's
no
sale.
the
sale
is
fictitious
and
that's
a
crime
under
--
under
the
act.
the
wash
sale
under
the
internal
revenue
code
is
entirely
a
different
sales,
a
real
sales
to
a
third
person
that
the
--
the
seller
repurchases
and
so
he
retains
his
economic
possession,
his
loss
is
an
actual
realized
loss
that
it's
merely
a
paper
loss
because
he
has
the
property
he
always
had.
on
the
other
hand,
the
gains
on
wash
sales
of
the
internal
revenue
code
are
real
gains
and
are
both
recognized
in
tax
and
the
valley
waste
mills
case
and
harriss
against
commissioner
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it
is
--
it
is
submitted
at
the
government's
semantics
on
the
identity
of
these
two
types
of
wash
sales
is
not
a
valid
point.
in
closing,
i
want
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
tax
court
and
the
government
in
its
brief
cite
the
valley
waste
mills
case
and
the
harriss
case.
now,
the
government
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
merely
refers
to
them
and
the
government's
brief
seems
to
imply
that
these
cases
were
decided
under
section
112
(b)
(1)
relating
to
exchange
as
a
property
used
in
trade
or
business
and
that
there
was
some
holding
about
whether
they
were
property
of
a
like
kind.
now,
we
have
studied
these
cases
as
--
there's
no
reference
to
section
112
(b)
(1),
maybe
one
of
them
in
the
valley
waste
mills
case,
the
court
merely
said
that
the
exchange
has
been
recognized
under
section
112
(a)
which
says
that
(inaudible)
are
recognized.
there
is
a
discussion
at
112
(b)
(1)
where
in
the
trenton
cotton
oil
case
where
the
court
held
that
--
that
the
gains
were
--
were
recognized
because
it
was
a
sale
and
a
purchase
and
not
an
exchange.
thank
you.
