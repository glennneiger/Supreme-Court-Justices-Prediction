mr.
jay
o.
kramer
may
it
please
the
court.
we've
asked
the
marshal
to
bring
in
an
easel
and
a
chart
which
we
will
use
during
the
course
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
yes.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
--
of
this
case
to
illustrate
certain
points.
this
case
comes
before
the
supreme
court
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
income
and
excess
profits
taxes
for
the
years
1940
and
1942.
the
actions
for
both
those
years
were
previously
consolidated
and
it
appears
as
one
proceeding
here.
the
order
of
certiorari
has
limited
the
review
by
this
court
to
two
points.
the
first
point,
which
i
will
discuss,
involves
the
following
question
where
petitioner's
transactions
in
commodity
futures,
which
are
not
true
hedges,
subject
to
the
capital
gain
and
loss
treatment
of
section
117
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
well,
were
they
are
ordinary
gains
and
losses
and
to
be
treated
the
same.point
two
which
mr.
mccain
will
discuss
is
an
entirely
distinct
point.
that
point
is
--
are
commodity
futures
securities
within
the
meaning
of
section
118
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
subject
to
the
so-called
wash
sales
provisions
thereof.
as
i
have
stated,
i
will
address
myself
solely
to
the
first
point.
the
facts
with
respect
to
this
issue
are
conceded.
they
start
or
are
caused
by
the
great
drought
of
1934
and
1936.
these
severe
droughts
caused
a
great
shortage
of
corn
in
our
midwestern
farming
areas.
the
result
of
that
was
that
the
price
of
corn
rose
substantially
during
the
years
1934,
1935,
1936
and
1937.
now,
the
petitioner
here
is
a
nationally
known
processor
of
raw
corn,
perhaps
the
largest
in
the
country.
petitioner's
main
products
consist
primarily
of
starch,
corn
syrup,
and
cerelose,
which
is
a
refined
corn
sugar.
its
byproducts
are
feed
and
corn
oil.
now,
cerelose,
the
refined
corn
sugar
competes
with
cane
and
beet
sugar.
it
is
used
in
canning,
candy
and
other
commercial
uses.
the
great
droughts
of
1934
and
1936
as
i
have
stated
caused
the
price
of
corn
to
rise
and
therefore
the
price
of
petitioner's
product,
cerelose.
the
result
was
that
petitioner
actually
lost
money
during
1937
on
every
sale
of
cerelose.
it
had
risen
out
of
line
with
the
price
of
cane
sugar
and
beet
sugar
because
your
honors
will
recognize
that
the
same
area
affected
by
the
drought
with
respect
to
corn
was
not
necessarily
affected
with
respect
to
raising
of
cane
sugar
or
beet
sugar.
petitioner
was
faced
with
a
serious
situation.
its
annual
grind
in
those
years
about
35
million
bushels
and
rose
gradually
during
the
years
here
in
question
to
almost
--
to
over
60
million
bushels
in
1942.
petitioner
could
only
store
2,300,000
bushels
in
its
facilities.
this
is
equivalent
to
about
three
weeks
grind.
the
problem
then
faced
petitioner's
officers
what
to
do
about
it.
they
envisaged
a
plan
or
a
program
whereby
they
would
buy
corn
futures
up
to
the
amount
of
11
or
12
millions
bushels
during
the
year
when
they
were
sure
in
july
or
fairly
certain
that
there
would
be
no
great
shortage
of
corn.
their
plan
was
to
liquidate
that
position
and
thereupon
pick
it
up
again
in
the
following
year.
now,
this
plan
didn't
quite
work
out
the
way
the
petitioner
had
envisaged
it.
the
petitioner
had
always
established
for
itself
a
corn
futures
position
but
as
i
say
during
these
years
it
became
considerably
larger.
when
the
commodity
exchange
authority
received
reports
from
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
is
required
to
file
such
reports
weekly,
the
commodity
exchange
authority
objected
to
the
size
of
petitioner's
position
and
proceeded
to
bring
an
action
against
this
petition.
by
the
time
the
action
was
commenced
however
and
discussions
were
under
way,
the
war
had
broken
out.
the
price
of
all
sugars,
cane
sugar,
beet
sugar
and
this
cerelose
rose
rapidly.
the
need
for
any
protection
had
vanished.
the
result
was,
as
seen
on
the
chart
which
appears
at
page
8
of
the
brief,
petitioner's
position
in
futures,
which
is
represented
by
this
stippled
area,
dropped
very
rapidly.
petitioner,
in
other
words,
liquidated
the
largest
part
of
its
futures
position.
i
might
say
at
the
beginning
that
it
wasn't
easy
for
petitioner
to
obtain
12
million
--
a
position
of
12
million
bushels
overnight.
it
had
to
work
its
way
up
gradually
and
that
you
will
see
in
this
line
at
the
beginning
of
the
chart
7138
as
you
can
see
gradually
reaching
the
peak
position
there.
and
i
further
state
that
this
chart
is
cumulative.
the
storage
capacity
is
represented
by
the
lowest
stippled
area.
the
inventory
is
added
to
that
in
this
second
area
and
again
the
futures
are
imposed
cumulatively
on
top
of
the
stock
to
show
the
total
long
position
of
the
petitioner
at
any
given
time
during
the
period
in
7138
through
to
the
end
of
1942.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
that
is
the
inventory
on
hand
of
finished
goods
and
above
that
the
futures
position.
it
represents,
in
other
words,
a
total
long
position
of
the
petitioner
--
of
the
--
of
reason
for
mentioning
that
at
this
time
will
be
brought
out
later
in
the
argument.
now,
during
these
years,
petitioner
had
a
constant
sales
policy.
this
includes
the
years
1936,
right
through
1942
and
that
was
this
and
it
is
brought
out
in
exhibit
10
in
the
record
at
page
104.
the
customer
ordering
any
of
petitioner's
products
will
always
receive
the
lower
of
the
contract
price
or
the
market
price
on
the
date
of
delivery.
the
lower
of
the
two
and
this
is
important
in
considering
the
question
of
hedging
which
we
will
get
to
a
little
later.
petitioner
also
had
the
policy
of
permitting
its
customers
to
cancel
unfilled
orders
at
any
time.
cancellations
were
frequent
and
unpredictable
as
the
record
will
show.
i
believe
the
--
the
record,
it
appears
at
page
68
and
69
on
that
point.
the
commodity
exchange,
as
i
have
stated,
brought
a
proceeding
against
the
petitioner
in
1939
to
--
charging
it
with
excessive
speculation
in
corn
futures.
when
the
war
broke
out,
as
this
chart
shows,
petitioner
liquidated
its
position.
the
result
was
that
the
matter
became
moot
and
was
dismissed.
there
was
no
opinion
on
the
merits.
this
is
brought
out
by
the
later
facts
after
the
taxable
years
that
after
the
war
when
petitioner
resumed
its
buying
of
corn
futures,
a
similar
proceeding
was
brought
against
this
petitioner
and
resulted
in
an
order
against
it.
that
order
is
recorded
in
13
agricultural
decisions
on
page
1117.
that
case
is
now
on
appeal
before
the
second
circuit.
the
--
the
secretary
of
agriculture
held
in
that
case
that
petitioner
was
not
hedging
and
even
though
as
in
later
years
it
was
brought
out,
certain
additional
things
were
done
despite
that
and
i'll
bring
that
out
later
in
the
argument,
the
court
or
rather
the
commission
of
the
agriculture
department
held
that
the
petitioner
was
not
hedging.
that
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
in
effect,
the
decision
was
--
was
that
they
were
speculating
in
excess
of
a
two
million
bushel
position,
which
was
allowable
under
the
rules
of
--
of
the
department.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
right.
buying
and
selling.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
the
petitioner
in
that
case
points
to
a
different
definition
of
hedging
contained
in
the
commodity
exchange
act
which
says
a
reasonable
hedge.
the
facts
in
that
case
were
dissimilar
than
in
the
present
case
for
the
reason
that
after
the
war,
the
petitioner
developed
a
method
of
predicting
what
its
sales
would
be
within
an
accuracy
of
5%
as
brought
out
in
that
case.
also,
petitioner
sold
short
cane
sugar
futures
and
cottonseed
oil
futures
so
that
it
maintained
a
balanced
position.
i'm
getting
a
bit
ahead
of
myself
in
defining
the
hedge.
but
the
--
the
effect
is
that
the
situation
there
was
quite
different
than
in
the
tactical
years.
so
as
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
about
11
million,
almost
11
million
bushels.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
our
annual
consumption
ran
from
35
million
bushels
in
1936
or
1937
to
over
60
million
bushels
in
1942.
now,
this
case
came
before
the
tax
court
of
the
united
states
which
held
that
the
corn
futures
program
of
petitioner,
this
area
that
you
see,
march
futures
on
the
chart,
was
an
integral
part
of
its
manufacturing
process
and
that
even
though
this
petitioner
was
not
technically
hedging,
nevertheless,
the
transaction
was
subject
to
ordinary
gains
and
loss
treatment.
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
went
on
to
say
that
while
petitioner
was
not
hedging,
the
property
was
used
for
essentially
the
same
purposes
and
should
be
treated
in
the
same
fashion
as
if
it
were
hedging
and
accorded
ordinary
gain
and
loss
treatment.
the
case
came
before
this
court
on
certiorari
because
what
appeared
to
be
a
conflict
with
the
third,
fifth
and
i
believe
the
sixth
circuits,
which
had
held
that
unless
a
true
hedge
were
established,
a
taxpayer
could
not
claim
an
ordinary
loss.
the
court
will
recognize
it
once
that
we're
dealing
with
the
other
side
of
the
picture
and
we
will
point
out
empathically
i
hope
at
a
later
point
that
where
the
government
is
dealing
with
losses,
where
the
commissioner
is
dealing
with
losses,
insist
on
the
test
of
a
true
hedge.
therefore,
limiting
the
taxpayer
to
a
capital
loss,
whereas
in
this
case,
the
situation
is
the
reverse
where
it's
dealing
with
a
profit,
he
will
say
that
it's
ordinary
and
--
and
forget
about
the
test
of
--
of
the
true
hedge.
incidentally
and
fairly
on
the
side,
the
case
because
of
peculiarity
of
the
excess
profits
tax
law
finds
the
petitioner
and
the
government
in
the
reversed
positions
of
that
which
would
ordinarily
be
expected.
in
this
case,
the
government
is
contending
in
effect
that
petitioner's
losses
were
ordinary
losses
fully
deductible
without
limit
by
saying
that
their
gains
are
ordinary
income
because
there
were
some
years
in
which
we
had
losses.
the
reason
for
that
is
in
the
computation
of
our
excess
profits
credit
for
the
--
is
1936
through
1939,
we
had
substantial
losses
and
ordinary
losses
would
have
the
effect
of
reducing
our
excess
profits
credit.
on
the
second
issue,
the
government
is
also
taking
a
unusual
position.
they
are
saying
that
the
wash
sales
provisions
do
not
apply
to
commodity
transactions.
now,
my
argument
with
respect
to
point
one
is
divided
into
two
separate
and
distinct
propositions.
the
first
proposition
is
that
section
117
(a)
in
defining
capital
assets
does
not
make
any
exception
for
assets
used
in
hedging,
although
it
makes
specific
exceptions
in
a
number
of
other
cases.
i
will
develop
the
statutory
history
of
section
117
to
show
the
specific
exclusions
to
the
definition
of
capital
assets.
our
position
is
there
is
no
statutory
justification
or
any
exception
in
the
nature
of
hedging
to
any
unwritten
or
implied
exception.
our
second
position,
our
second
line
of
defense
is
that
even
if
there
is
a
hedging
exception,
petitioner's
transactions
do
not
fall
with
any
--
within
any
such
unwritten
exception
to
section
117
(a).
and
therefore,
unless
it
is
established
that
the
petitioner
was
engaging
in
true
hedging
operation,
its
transactions
must
be
treated
as
capital
transactions
and
the
result
in
gain
or
loss
computed
accordingly.
i
would
like
to
read
if
i
may
because
it
is
so
important
here,
section
117
(a)
because
as
the
court
will
see,
there's
a
missing
phrase
in
--
in
that
section.
when
i
say
a
missing
phrase,
i
mean
that
it
was
never
once
mentioned
either
in
the
tax
court's
opinion,
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
or
in
respondent's
brief
except
in
the
appendix
when
the
section
was
printed.
capital
assets
are
defined
at
page
53
of
our
brief
and
--
and
we
are
reading
from
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
"the
term
capital
assets
means
property
held
by
the
taxpayer."
the
next
phrase
is
the
missing
phrase,
"it's
parenthetical
whether
or
not
connected
with
his
trade
or
business,
but
does
not
include
stock
and
trade
of
the
taxpayer
or
other
property
of
a
kind
which
properly
would
be
included
in
the
inventory
of
the
taxpayer
if
on
hand
at
the
close
of
the
taxable
year,
or
property
held
by
the
taxpayer
primarily
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
his
trade
or
business,
or
property,
used
in
the
trade
or
business,
of
a
character
which
is
subject
to
an
allowance
for
depreciation
provided
in
section
23
(l)."
i
would
like
to
go
far
back
into
the
history
of
the
internal
revenue
statutes
and
pick
up
the
ancestor
of
that
section
and
point
out
that
in
1921,
the
--
essentially
the
same
definition
appeared
in
the
law,
we
have
quoted
that
definition
at
page
4
of
our
reply
brief,
"the
term
capital
assets
as
used
in
this
section
means
property
and
acquired
--
acquired
and
held
by
the
taxpayer
for
profit
or
investment
for
more
than
two
years
whether
or
not
connected
with
his
trade
or
business."
again,
the
missing
clause,
"but
does
not
include
property
held
for
personal
use
or
consumption
of
the
taxpayer
or
his
family
or
stock
and
trade
of
the
taxpayer
or
other
property
of
a
kind
which
would
be
properly
includable
in
inventory
of
the
taxpayer
if
on
hand
at
the
close
of
the
taxable
year."
right
at
the
start,
the
definition
of
capital
asset
was
any
assets
held
by
the
taxpayer
for
over
two
years.
this
was
changed
as
we
will
see
in
1934.
but
right
at
the
very
start,
congress
sought
that
to
state
that
they
were
capital
assets
whether
or
not
connected
with
his
trade
or
business
and
congress
saw
fit
to
make
specific
exceptions
or
exclusions
thereto.
and
so
this
concept
continued
with
slight
modifications
in
the
revenue
acts
of
1924,
1926,
1928
and
1932.
this
is
a
statement
about
personal
use
or
consumption
was
dropped
from
the
statute
very
shortly.
in
1934
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i'm
very
sorry,
your
honor,
i
thought
that
our
reply
brief
was
available
to
the
court.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i
think
that's
on
the
certiorari
application.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
sorry,
sir.
in
1934,
congress
in
enacting
section
117
(b)
defined
capital
assets
in
substantially
the
same
manner
as
it
now
appears
in
the
present
code,
it
says,
"definition
of
capital
assets
for
this
purpose,
the
term
capital
assets
means
property
held
by
the
taxpayer
and
again
whether
or
not
connected
with
his
trade
or
business."
i'm
reading
from
page
5
of
the
reply
brief,
"but
does
not
include
stock
and
trade
or
other
property
of
a
kind
which
would
be
includable
in
inventory
of
the
taxpayer
if
on
hand
at
the
close
of
the
taxable
year
or
property
held
by
taxpayer
primarily
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
his
trade
or
business.”
now,
there's
one
thought
i
think
i
should
set
at
rest
at
the
very
beginning
and
that
is
this.
these
futures
were
not
sold
to
our
customers
in
the
regular
course
of
business.
they
were
sold
through
brokers
on
the
exchange.
we
never
knew
the
name
of
the
customer.
the
--
our
regular
products
were
sold
to
our
regular
customers.
these
futures
were
merely
disposed
of
on
the
exchange.
there
never
has
been
any
assertion
by
respondent
that
we
were
dealers
in
futures
or
anything
like
that.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
do
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i
--
i
understand
that
petitioner
still
maintains
a
position
in
corn
futures.
he
--
they
are
permitted
so
to
do
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
to
the
extent
of
two
million
bushels
and
the
commodity
exchange
proceeding
now
pending
as
to
determine
if
anything
above
that
may
be
maintained.
now,
the
first
point
of
law
that
we
would
like
to
make
is
this,
that
where
congress
sets
up
a
general
definition
that
assets
are
capital
assets
and
provides
for
a
series
of
exclusions
that
there
is
no
room
for
any
other
exclusion
to
be
implied.
this
is
all
the
more
true
in
the
present
case
because
congress
has
given
this
section
a
tremendous
amount
of
attention
from
1921
right
through
to
1954.
and
wherever
shoe
was
pinched,
wherever
congress
has
thought
it
necessary,
it
has
added
additional
exclusions.
i
need
only
refer
to
the
so-called
eisenhower
amendment
with
respect
to
artistic
works
where
a
--
an
author
no
longer
receives
capital
gain
treatment
for
his
artistic
efforts.
but
congress,
not
the
commissioner,
required
that
result.
our
point
then
is
further
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
congress
was
not
unaware
of
the
existence
of
hedging
as
a
concept.
if
the
court
will
recall,
section
502
of
the
internal
revenue
code
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
personal
holding
company
income
specifically
excludes
profits
from
hedging
transactions.
in
1954,
when
congress
passed
the
new
internal
revenue
code,
they
specifically
provided
that
in
section
1233
that
--
that
hedging
transactions
would
not
come
within
the
short
sale
rule.
but
the
congress
did
not
at
the
same
time
amend
section
1231,
which
is
the
successor
to
section
117
(a),
to
provide
that
assets
used
in
hedging
were
to
be
an
exception
to
section
117
(a).
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i
will
come
to
that
at
once,
sir.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
in
1934,
congress
abolished
the
two-year
rule
defining
capital
assets
and
thereafter
said
all
assets
are
capital
assets.
the
commissioner's
regulations
echoed
that
provision.
now,
before
1934,
this
question
of
commodity
futures
was
academic
because
commodity
futures
by
their
nature
matured
in
less
than
two
years
and
therefore,
no
commodity
future
prior
to
that
time
was
a
capital
asset.
after
1934,
there
was
no
such
situation.
accordingly
in
1936,
the
treasury
issued
general
counsel's
memorandum
17322,
and
this
for
the
first
time
expounded
the
theory
of
hedging
as
insurance
and
therefore
that
losses
in
hedging
would
result
in
any
ordinary
losses
in
the
nature
of
an
insurance
or
business
deduction.
significantly,
this
general
counsel's
memorandum
was
never
promulgated
into
regulation.
the
normal
course
of
events
in
many
general
counsel's
memorandum
is
to
promulgate
it
into
regulation
and
then
if
there
is
a
statutory
reenactment
at
a
later
date,
it
is
deemed
to
have
received
legislative
sanction,
such
is
not
the
case
here.
now,
following
the
enactment
or
--
or
the
promulgation
of
this
regulation
which
never
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke
myself,
following
the
issuance
of
this
general
counsel's
memorandum,
a
series
of
cases
began
to
arise
in
the
courts
in
which
hedging
as
an
exception
to
117
(a)
first
became
apparent.
those
cases
are
detailed
at
page
22
of
our
initial
brief.
they
start
as
the
court
will
see
in
1940
and
in
1941.
i'm
getting
a
bit
ahead
of
myself,
unfortunately,
because
i
will
have
to
develop
those
--
those
cases
a
little
further
when
i
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
many
of
them
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
many
of
them
did
so.
many
of
them
cited
the
general
counsel's
memorandum
directly.
but
this
general's
--
the
general
counsel's
memorandum
never
had
before
as
an
effective
law.
however,
the
regulation
with
respect
to
117
(a)
which
specifically
states,
the
term
capital
assets
includes
all
classes
of
property
not
specifically
excluded
by
section
117
(a).
that
regulation
has
appeared
in
every
regulation
in
connection
with
every
act
since
1934,
1934,
1936,
1938,
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
the
amendments
thereto
in
1942
and
again
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
i
say
that
that
regulation
by
statutory
reenactment
has
received
legislative
sanction
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
are
here
making.
first,
that
there
is
no
statutory
justification
for
any
implied
exception
in
the
form
of
hedging
and
that
this
is
confirmed
by
repeated
reenactment
of
law
without
making
any
specific
exception
for
"assets
used
in
hedging”,
four
words
could
have
changed
the
problem
but
they
did
not
do
so.
the
second
point
which
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
even
if
there
is
a
hedging
reception
--
exception
and
we
do
not
concede
that
there
is,
the
test
is
whether
or
not
taxpayer
was
engaging
in
true
hedging
operations
and
not
something
akin
to
it.
the
words
of
the
tax
court
that
petitioner's
transactions
were
an
integral
part
of
its
manufacturing
process
can
be
accepted
as
correct.
if
you
say
that
everything
that
a
taxpayer
does
as
part
of
its
business,
but
congress
had
specifically
stated
that
assets
remain
capital
assets
whether
or
not
used
in
the
taxpayers
business.
so
i
would
say
that
the
tax
court's
opinion
simply
disregards
that
missing
phrase.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
said
these
assets
were
used
in
the
same
manner
as
in
hedging
and
therefore
we're
going
to
treat
them
the
same
way.
and
once
again,
never
mentions
the
fact
that
the
definition
of
capital
assets
says
whether
or
not
used
in
the
taxpayer's
business.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
unfortunately,
the
tax
court's
opinion
in
this
case
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
203
--
i'm
sorry,
201
and
following,
is
very
cryptic.
at
211,
this
particular
issue
is
decided
in
two
fairly
short
paragraphs.
it
would
almost
be
worthwhile
reading
it
if
the
court
wishes.
the
key
sentence
is
right
at
the
beginning.
it
says
although
perhaps,
not
conforming
technically
to
the
definition
of
a
hedge,
it
seems
indisputable
as
our
finding
show
that
petitioner's
practice
of
purchasing
corn
futures
was
as
an
integral
part
of
its
manufacturing
business.
no
mention
of
section
117
(a)
in
the
particular
phrase
which
i
call
the
missing
phrase.
it
would
hence
be
anomalous
to
view
them
as
purely
speculative
transactions
of
a
capital
nature
and
so
on.
the
tax
court
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i
don't
think
the
courts
have
treated
this
as
a
factual
situation
at
any
point.
they
have
held
you're
either
hedging
as
matter
of
law
or
you're
not.
and
if
you're
not,
the
results
are
that
you
have
capital
gain
and
if
you
are,
you
have
ordinary
income.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
well,
the
phrase
hedging
has
many
connotations
including
hedging
on
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
well,
the
cases
so
treat
it.
the
whole
series
of
cases,
all
--
all
turned
on
the
point,
is
this
a
true
hedge?
if
--
if
it
isn't,
you
will
not
receive
the
ordinary
deductions.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i
am
going
to
endeavor
to
do
so.
we
try
to
reach
the
definition
of
hedging
in
a
series
of
statements
made
in
our
brief
outlining
the
principles
of
what
hedging
is.
hedging
is
essentially
the
maintenance
of
a
balanced
position
which
eliminates
the
risk
of
the
market.
at
page
24
of
our
initial
brief,
we
make
a
series
of
statements
which
will
help
define
what
hedging
is
as
far
as
tax
cases
are
concerned.
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
define
hedging
on
several
occasions.
the
initial
attempt
to
define
it
was
in
chicago
board
of
trade
versus
christie
stock
--
grain
&
stock
company.
there,
the
court
said,
hedging
as
it
is
called
is
a
means
which
collectors
and
exporters
of
grain
or
other
products
and
manufactured,
who
make
contracts
in
advance
for
the
sale
of
their
goods,
secure
themselves
against
the
fluctuations
of
the
market
by
counter
contracts
for
the
purchase
or
sale
as
a
case
maybe
of
an
equal
quantity
of
the
product
or
the
material
of
manufacture.
now,
during
the
statement
of
facts,
i
laid
some
emphasis
on
the
undisputed
fact
that
petitioner
had
no
fixed
prices
on
the
sale
of
its
merchandise.
petitioner
took
the
risk
when
it
sold
that
its
costumer
would
receive
the
lower
of
two
prices,
either
the
contract
price
or
the
market
price
if
it
went
down.
petitioner
also
allowed
its
costumers
to
cancel
their
contracts
wherever
they
so
desired.
consequently,
when
we
examine
this
chart
here,
these
red
lines
or
columns
indicating
orders
are
orders
in
name
only,
they
are
not
fixed
as
to
price,
they
are
not
fixed
as
to
quantity
because
a
costumer
finding
that
the
market
has
dropped
may
cancel.
he
may
also
take
at
the
lower
price
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
tax
court
said,
"we
are
not
technically
hedging."
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
it
says,
"we
--
that
we
are
not
engaging
in
true
hedging."
the
respondent
himself
in
his
brief
admits
that
we
are
not
true
--
i
am
not
truly
hedging.
but
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondent
says
it
makes
no
difference.
it's
immaterial.
we
are
doing
something
in
connection
with
our
business
here
and
therefore
it's
going
to
be
taxed
at
ordinary
income
rates
and
losses
are
ordinarily
deductible,
completely
disregarding
that
initial
trade
in
section
117
(a)
which
says,
"whether
or
not
connected
with
taxpayers
business.”
i
see
that
my
time
is
fast
expiring.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
just
one
further
point.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
in
the
same
supreme
court
case,
it
defined
hedging
that
christie
grain
case.
this
court
defined
people
who
deal
in
futures
in
three
categories.
one,
speculators,
two,
legitimate
capitalist
and
i
hope
that
that's
not
a
word
of
the
program
as
i
would
get,
to
gather
from
my
opponent's
brief.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
in
my
opponent's
brief.
and
three,
hedges.
we
claim
that
we
fall
within
the
legitimate
capitalist
class.we
have
taken
a
position,
a
long
position
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
true,
it
--
it
is
in
reference
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
they
differ
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
it
was
probably
out,
but
i
wouldn't
be
too
certain
because
the
line
has
never
been
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
well,
who
is
an
investor
and
who
is
a
speculator
is
a
question
that
would
require
better
brains
and
mind
to
answer.
it
may
be
a
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
--
question
of
degree.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
[laughs]
i
--
i
understand
you
at
this
point.
the
situation
with
respect
to
whether
somebody
is
a
capitalist
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misstated
myself.
this
court
has
defined
the
person
who
is
head
--
who
is
engaging
in
futures
transaction
in
these
three
categories
and
i
am
--
before
i
sit,
compelled
to
accept
that
as
being
the
--
the
law
even
though
it
was
not
issued
in
a
tax
case.
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
christie?
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
oh,
completely.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
completely.
this
court
has
never
had
a
case
involving
hedging
in
a
tax
matter
before
and
i'm
about
to
point
out
if
i
may
that
what
the
taxpayer
intends
to
do
is
immaterial
in
every
one
of
the
cases
which
the
government
won
cited
at
pages
22
of
our
brief.
the
taxpayers
conscientiously
thought
they
were
hedging.
nevertheless,
the
courts
ruled
against
them
and
said,
"you
are
not
engaged
in
a
true
hedge
and
therefore
you
are
subject
to
a
capital
loss."
this
court
momentarily
did
have
this
question
before
it
but
only
on
an
application
for
certiorari.
in
commissioner
versus
farmers
&
ginners
cotton
oil
company,
certiorari
was
denied
in
314
u.s.683.
and
i
have
taken
perhaps
unfair
advantage
of
my
opponent
in
quoting
liberally
from
the
respondent's
brief
in
that
case
in
which
the
respondent
there
took
the
position
that
unless
it
was
a
true
hedge,
capital
gain
treatment
would
be
accorded
or
capital
loss
treatment
would
be
accorded
and
not
ordinary
deduction
because
that
was
the
issue
in
that
case.
i'd
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
inconsistent
position
which
appears
at
page
17
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
may
i
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
well
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
well,
the
only
reason,
if
i
may
answer
your
honor
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
yes.
the
only
reason
i
would
even
mention
that
if
i
may
use
this
time
just
to
answer
your
honor's
question
is
subsequent
to
this
case,
the
bureau
has
--
the
--
the
internal
revenue
department
has
gone
back
to
the
same
position
that
it
took
in
the
earlier
cases
in
fulton
bag
&
cotton
mills,
22
t.c.
1044
which
is
cited
at
the
bottom
of
page
22.
so
this
is
not
a
position
which
the
government
has
taken
just
once.
it
has
taken
it,
it
is
abandoned
it
in
this
case
because
it
involves
gains
and
then
gone
back
to
it
in
the
next
case
involving
losses.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
may
i
ask
mr.
mccain
to
continue
with
point
two.
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
i
believe
i
have
six
minutes
to
reply,
the
marshal
has
so
informed
me.
i
waited
with
some
impatience,
i
will
admit,
to
find
out
whether
the
respondent
at
last
was
going
to
utter
the
missing
phrase
which
the
courts
below
had
never
paid
any
attention
to
which
has
appeared
in
every
statute
since
1921
and
that
is
the
definition
of
capital
assets
includes
all
assets
whether
or
not
connected
with
taxpayers
trade
or
business.
the
respondent
has
--
the
court
will
see
that
explained
what
that
phrase
means
and
i
submit
that
it
means
just
what
it
says.
number
two,
respondent
--
i
would
like
to
turn
this
proceeding
into
a
question
of
fact.
both
courts
below
have
held
that
we
were
not
engaged
in
true
hedging
operations.
other
courts
have
held
that
that
is
the
test.is
this
a
true
hedge
or
not?
if
it
is
not
a
true
hedge,
then
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
must
have
capital
treatment.
otherwise,
you
have
ordinary
loss.
so
it
is
not
a
question
of
fact,
it
is
a
question
of
law.
number
three,
i
produced
this
chart
blown
up
in
this
fashion
for
one
purpose,
to
show
that
there
is
no
correlation
between
our
orders
and
our
futures
position.
on
7141,
when
our
orders
were
at
their
highest,
we
had
the
smallest
future
position.
at
7138,
when
our
orders
were
at
their
lowest
point,
we
had
our
largest
futures
position
accumulative.
in
fact,
there
we
had
five
--
we
had
almost
10
billion
--
10
million
bushels
of
futures.
all
our
futures
position
was
--
was
a
calculated
risk
that
we
were
going
to
have
a
--
that
we
were
going
to
have
a
rise
in
the
corn
market
rather
than
a
fall.
all
we
did
is
shift
the
risk
from
a
risk
that
corn
would
rise
to
a
risk
that
corn
might
go
down.
in
commissioner
versus
farmers
&
ginners
cotton
oil
company,
fifth
circuit
1941,
reported
at
120
f.2d
722,
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
hedge
when
a
taxpayer
who
manufactured
crude
cottonseed
oil
which
it
sold
for
refined
cottonseed
futures,
it
thereby
merely
shifted
the
risk,
the
court
said,
that
refine
might
go
down
in
price.
all
we
did
by
establishing
our
futures
position
here
to
take
the
risk
that
the
price
of
corn
would
go
down.
that
has
been
denominated
as
partial
insurance
but
it
is
not
insurance
at
all.
it's
the
taking
of
a
position.
if
i
buy
real
estate,
i
shift
the
risk
from
the
risk
that
that
real
estate
might
go
up
in
price
to
the
risk
that
it
might
go
down
in
price.
that
is
not
insurance.
it
is
merely
the
taking
of
a
position.
now
--
mr.
jay
o.
kramer
we
are
entitled
to
take
a
position.
we
contend
there
is
a
purpose
if
we
wish
to
we
can
get
the
delivery
of
raw
corn
by
buying
futures
and
where
we
have
done
so,
we
have
correctly
reported
it
as
part
of
our
inventory.
but
there's
no
contention
here
and
the
court
below
has
held
that
these
futures
were
not
part
of
our
inventory.
the
tax
court
so
found.
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
point
out
there's
an
obvious
inaccuracy
in
that
committee
report
which
was
read
to
the
court
appearing
at
page
29
of
the
brief.
we
have
all
admitted
the
section
730
--
that
general
counsel's
memorandum
17322
never
became
part
of
regulations
and
yet
the
committee
report
said
this
result
is
based
on
case
law
and
regulations.
actually,
the
only
regulation
here
which
has
any
force
or
effect
is
the
regulation
which
states
all
assets
are
capital
assets
unless
specifically
excluded
and
that
has
appeared
in
every
regulation
since
1934.
it
has
had
repeated
reenactment
and
judicial
sanction
arising
therefrom.
with
respect
to
the
118
point,
the
fact
that
congress
in
1951,
i
believe,
changed
the
law
and
required
--
and
stated
that
the
holding
period
would
not
include
where
there
had
been
a
shift
in
--
in
futures
positions
from
one
future
to
another
--
from
one
maturity
to
another
i
should
i
say.
it
indicates
very
clearly
to
me
that
that
was
not
the
law
before
that
time
and
therefore
cannot
be
taken
as
indicative
of
anything.
i
believe
that
that
covers
all
of
the
points
which
we
wish
to
--
to
make
except
to
say
in
summary
that
what
the
respondent
wants
this
court
to
do
is
to
disregard
specific
language
in
the
statute,
to
disregard
repeated
enactment
of
that
statute,
to
disregard
his
own
regulations
and
to
disregard
the
repeated
statement
of
those
regulations
year
after
year,
code
after
code
and
that
is
the
position
the
respondent
--
the
petitioner
respectfully
submits
is
incorrect.
