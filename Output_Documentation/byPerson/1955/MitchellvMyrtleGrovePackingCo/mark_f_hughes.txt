mr.
mark
f.
hughes
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
i
am
interested
in
the
rather,
i
might
say,
if
it's
not
prohibited
here,
unfair
statement
of
facts
made
by
the
attorney
representative
of
the
labor
department.
they
have
pursued
that
same
course
in
this
matter
since
the
inception
of
this
lawsuit
about
five
or
six
years
ago.
the
oyster
and
shrimp
industry
in
the
south
who
cares,
now
among
its
workers,
probably
the
freest
labor
of
both
colors,
white
and
black,
the
least
segregated
and
the
fairest
treated
of
any
in
the
united
states
was
a
very
small
business.
it's
not
only
a
small
business.
it's
not
as
big
as
the
menhaden
business
where
they
go
out
and
pick
the
fish
from
the
sea
and
turn
them
into
fertilizer
and
meal.
it's
a
smaller
business
because
there
is
a
limit
of
what
it
can
do.
that
is
the
limit
of
number
of
shrimp
in
the
sea
and
the
water
--
the
oysters
that
we
can
produce
by
propagation.
however,
it
is
a
peculiar
business
because
it's
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
just
like
it
is
from
north
carolina
to
mexico.
nowhere
in
the
world
do
you
find
people,
there
are
people
who
are
catching
oysters
and
eat
them.
there
are
people
who
catch
a
shrimp
and
eat
them,
but
nowhere
in
the
world
do
you
find
a
small
industry,
and
this
is
small,
while
i'll
represent
the
myrtle
grove
canning
company.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
speaking
for
the
entire
industry
and
the
entire
industry
is
not
so
much
interested
in
itself.
it's
interested
in
this
class
of
people
who
over
a
hundred
years
has
helped
it,
worked
for
it,
been
a
part
of
it,
in
fact,
produced
the
man
who
now
operate
the
industry.
i
don't
presume
that
the
limit
in
north
carolina,
the
guy
was
in
texas
that
they
had
two
funds
that
have
assets
exceeding
half
a
million
dollars.
and
yet,
among
the
people
who
came
from
those
men
who
went
down
to
the
sea
in
both
of
the
foreign
dominions
have
come
aside
of
an
independent
race
of
people
down
there,
who
for
over
80
or
90
years
have
been
making
a
living
in
this
oyster
and
shrimp
industry.
now,
when
this
law
was
passed,
the
industry
was
even
as
far
as
its
labor
was
of
concerned,
not
only
integrated
but
it
will
unionize,
two
strong
local
unions,
one
of
the
man
who
is
active
and
went
out
to
sea
to
catch
the
fish
that
they
brought
into
the
factories,
the
other,
the
old
man,
white,
black,
green
and
yellow,
young
and
old,
who
would
were
the
shuckers
and
the
shrimp
pickers
were
unionized.
from
1932,
as
the
record
will
show
here,
until
the
time
this
case
first
came
before
a
federal
court,
these
people
through
their
own
efforts
not
universally
because
there's
a
great
difference
in
the
class
of
pay
among
the
same
people,
but
these
people
on
the
average
through
their
own
efforts
had
raised
their
pay
a
thousand
percent.
and
while
this
act
is
trying
to
cover
all
of
the
shrimp
pickers
and
the
oyster
openers
and
i
want
to
say
this,
i
have
a
great
pride
in
my
profession
because
my
great
grandfather
was
a
member
of
it.but
these
people
are
just
as
distinct
and
have
attributes
of
their
own
as
lawyers.
that
is
their
vocation
--
avocation
in
life.
they
know
nothing
else.
if
you
stop
them
tomorrow,
they
would
either
go
on
the
pitiful,
penurious,
old-age
pension
that
we
have
in
our
state
and
in
some
of
the
other
states,
and
i
may
say
this
that
im
not
reflecting
upon
our
state,
it's
because
of
the
poverty
of
the
state.
they
can
do
--
they
are
doing
the
best
they
can
or
they
would
get
this
door
that
the
ordinary
man,
$35
or
$40
that's
called
social
security.
now,
the
independent
people,
there
are
people
that
have
bread
in
the
life
of
the
independents
and
they
breath
to
see
in
the
time
of
their
birth
that
not
only
brings
in
the
men
ideas
of
adventure,
one
of
which
created
this
court
as
well
as
this
nation,
but
that
are
always
in
the
little
ways
different
from
other
people.
now,
certainly,
when
a
man
goes
out
there
and
spends
his
life
at
the
sea,
he
doesn't
get
rich.
his
family
doesn't
get
rich.
he
gets
old
quicker
than
you
are.
he's
68
years.
they
are
on
him,
heavier
than
my
68
years.
and
when
he
comes
to
a
time
that
he
can
no
longer
know
what
was
safety
to
the
man
with
him,
he
won't
sway
of
making
a
living
around
the
place
that
he
live
with
a
man
he
associated
with
and
in
this
shrimp
picking
and
oyster
shucking
organization,
he
has
a
part.
so,
when
this
law
came
into
effect,
the
mavar
and
their
cases
called
donnely
versus
mavar
referred
to
as
the
donnely
case.
it
was
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
by
my
friend
and
one
of
the
greatest
gentlemen
we
have
on
the
bench
today,
judge
holmes
in
our
case.
some
few
number
of
the
union
wanted
this
page,
probably,
the
ones
that
could
make
the
75
cents
because
some
of
them
made
50,
a
few
--
a
few
more
made
60
and
70
and
75,
but
more
made
$80,
$1.5
and
$2
varying
on
their
youth,
their
skill
and
the
time
that
they
could
give
to
their
work.
so,
some
of
them
began
to
grumble
and
we
filed
the
declaratory
judgment
case
to
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
to
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
we
invited
the
labor
department
to
contest
it.
they
didn't
contest
it
and
even
as
the
young
lady
on
the
other
side
is
talking
about
a
hearing
that
she
didn't
attend
but
which
i
was
in
close
contact
with,
i'm
going
to
say
that
if
the
trial
of
this
case
which
i
conducted
for
the
attorney
of
the
department
of
justice
were
setting
within
the
bar
and
was
invited
by
judge
myers,
one
of
the
finest
judges
we
have
in
the
lower
federal
judiciary
to
come
in
and
take
a
part.
we
won
that
case.
it
was,
i
will
say
a
friendly
case.
they
were
not
enemies.
they
didn't
have
shotguns
out
but
they
had
the
aimless
lawyers
they
could
get
in
that
part
of
mississippi.
and
that
was
appeared
before
this
court
and
the
man
who
at
that
time
was
a
president
of
the
bar
association,
the
mississippi
representative.
and
when
judge
myers
decided
in
our
favor
and
we
went
over
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
then
they
did
come
into
court.
they
come
in
to
a
court
with
a
brief,
not
only
arguing
the
law,
but
attacking
to
express
some
of
our
state
bar
association
and
myself
for
the
handling
of
this
lawsuit,
although,
they
had
to
change
from
the
very
beginning.
they
were
invited.
i
sent
a
copy
of
the
bill
of
complaint
to
the
department
myself
at
birmingham.
now,
judge
holmes,
in
what
i
think
is
a
great
opinion,
a
sort
of
a
homely
opinion,
a
philosophic
opinion,
an
opinion
where
he
gets
down
to
earth
and
considers
men
and
people
and
not
holding
the
wisdom
of
taking
everybody
and
make
them
in
a
little
move
and
sending
them
down
a
certain
path,
decided
that
the
sole
reason
of
that
was
processing,
was
to
cover
everything
except
canning.
now,
when
this
case
got
up
here,
when
they
selected
a
core
firm
there,
it
could
get
us
a
sort
of
or
a
kind
of
situation
in
mexico
of
shrimp
and
kind
of
situate
in
new
mexico
ship
row
and
went
in
this
business
temporarily,
but
almost
wholly
with
canning.
when
they
brought
that
record
up
here,
they
brought
just
a
narrower
record
here,
just
enough
to
show
interstate
commerce,
which
we
had
to
admit
and
then
oysters
were
canned
and
so
forth
and
i
may
see
in
the
trial
of
the
case
one
of
the
men
who
broke
his
words
and
we
own
some
evidence
that
we
took.
so,
when
we
presented
it
to
the
court,
we
want
to
show
you
what
these
processes
other
than
canning
are
and
what
the
processes
of
canning.
we
have
appendix
4
to
our
brief
on
page
114.
the
number
of
the
page
is
being
quite
in
the
court
because
it's
largely
devoted
to
that
which
the
court
can
consider
or
not.
then,
we
have
appendix
50123
and
the
court
will
see
there
and
that
was
the
evidence
before
the
court
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
on
which
judge
holmes,
whose
opinion
i'm
now
trying
to
uphold
wrote
his
find
and
wonderful
opinion
and
that
was
the
evidence
before
him
and
this
suit
is
not
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
myrtle
grove
canning
company.
it's
a
suit
against
the
entire
shrimp
and
oyster
industry
of
the
south
and
the
southwest
and
an
attempt
to
overturn.
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
had
to
go
and
to
--
pardon
me
to
use
the
word,
to
--
to
adopt
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit,
a
very
wonderful
opinion,
a
logical
opinion,
an
opinion,
which
satisfies
the
department
of
labor.
now,
the
sole
argument,
the
really
basic
argument
and
the
only
argument
that
really
amounts
to
anything
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
is
this
that
the
courts
should
follow
and
give
strong
consideration
as
i
think
it
does
when
they're
right
to
the
administrative
finding
what
it
says,
and
the
fourth
circuit
did
that,
should
be
the
law.
but
when
it's
rejected,
as
the
fifth
circuit,
rejected
it
in
the
face
of
the
language
of
the
law,
in
the
face
of
the
facts
before
it,
in
the
face
of
the
meaning
of
english
language,
then
it's
bad
law
and
the
bad
law
of
a
circuit
ought
to
be
set
aside
so
that
the
good
luck
of
this
changing
labor
department
should
prevail.
i
want
the
court
--
call
to
the
court
how
ridiculous
that
would
be.
since
this
case,
since
this
case
has
been
on
the
docket,
there's
been
three
different
titles,
coleman,
durkin
and
mitchell.
every
two
or
three
years,
we
have
somebody
according
to
the
contention
of
the
labor
department
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner.
somebody
that
can
say,
“this
is
the
law
and
that's
a
law.”
and
destroy
the
lives
and
the
hopes
of
8
or
10
or
15
to
20
decent
--
a
thousand
decent
americans
who
want
to
live
as
one
of
them
said
in
their
testimony
here,
although
that
i
can
find
it
right
away,
allow
me
just
a
second.
this
is
the
secretary
of
the
labor
union
who
said
this,
“we
would
like
to
work
like
we
did
in
the
past
which
has
been
the
method
of
our
grandfathers
and
grandmothers.
in
piecework,
you
earn
what
you
can.”
a
scale
of
works
set
by
the
association
and
then
brought
to
a
meeting
with
the
packers.
we
would
like
to
wake
like
we
did
in
the
past
and
then
another
one,
the
president
of
the
union,
a
woman
i
know
myself
who
find
a
woman
who
has
ever
lived
in
america
who
has
brought
her
people
from
--
you
might
say
five
cents
or
10
cents,
a
certain
portion
for
oysters
up
to
a
$1,
a
race
of
1000
percent
in
less
than
20
years
said
that
not
only
she
but
many,
many
others
of
the
old
people.
thank
god
that
every
night
that
they
had
the
right
to
go
down
there
and
work
to
the
extent
of
their
ability
to
work.
they
work
--
some
of
them
for
two
hours,
some
for
six
hours,
some
for
four
hours.
they
stay
away
for
an
hour.
they
come
back
when
they
please
and
do
what
they
please.
the
only
real
control
we
have
over
them
is
that
they
must
while
they
--
they
pick
shrimp
and
shuck
oysters.
now,
the
decision
of
this
court
means
just
this
and
i
think
i
have
just
as
much
right
to
argue
the
economic
problem
to
the
court
if
it
affects
the
welfare
of
people
as
a
social
problem.
the
decision
of
the
court
in
this
case,
which
i
say
would
be
contrary
to
the
expressed
contention
of
the
legislature
if
it
accepted
the
idea
and
theory
of
the
petitioner,
would
be
to
destroy
the
way
of
living
and
the
way
of
working
of
people
who
have
no
other
way
and
no
other
place
to
work.
now,
the
case,
which
she's
talking
about,
is
referred
to
in
the
brief
as
the
blue
channel
case,
the
law
of
crab
and
oyster
placed
down
in
south
georgia.
they
won
it
but
they
didn't
win
anything
for
the
pickers
because
in
my
idea,
that
the
way
i
get
it
in
the
record,
is
a
form
of
letter
to
have
a
man
in
the
package
business
for
the
blue
channel
corporation
showing
that
they
have
protected
an
oyster
picker
as
then
when
the
case
is
tried
to
had
a
shrimp
picker.
so,
with
this
--
if
this
view
of
the
fourth
circuit
is
taken
as
far
as
the
four
miserable
people
who
do
the
work
is
concerned
that
the
labor
department
is
supposed
to
look
after
it
will
be
appearing
victory.
they
would
have
won
an
illusionary
75
cents
an
hour,
something
that
they'll
never
get
because
as
this
lady
says,
“they'll
be
denied
the
right
to
work
as
their
grandmothers
and
grandfathers
who
would
like
to
work.”
but
to
show
you,
may
it
please
court,
and
i'm
right,
she
says
the
only
thing
about
processes
is
the
manhattan
people,
that
great
destroyer
of
aquatic
life
that
really
should
be
forbidden.
it's
wrong.
this
is
out
of
a
craze.
i
think
my
--
one
of
my
associates
is
engaged
in
it,
i'm
not.
that
isn't
true.
in
the
record
of
this
case,
we
refer
to
it
on
page
4
of
the
brief.
i
think
it's
record
--
at
page
26.
the
labor
department,
the
petitioner
here
agreed
that
the
principal
part
of
the
defendant's
operation
was
in
the
purchase,
handling,
processing,
canning
and
sale
and
distribution
of
oysters
and
shrimps.
that
as
--
answers
the
justices'
question.
there
is
processing.
there
is
a
process
before
canning.
you
could
take
the
great
frenchman,
who
in
the
napoleonic
wars,
discovered
canning
and
see
what
he
claimed
for
it.
he
just
claimed
by
hermetically
seal
in
the
can,
you
could
preserve
food.
and
most
of
the
dictionaries
for
50
are
--
are
more
years
carried
that
definition.
they
broadened
it
a
little
bit,
put
in
(inaudible),
cleaning
it,
preparing
it.
now,
if
you
look
at
our
books
there,
you'll
see
these
many,
many
things.
these
oysters
come
in
to
this
canning
room
filthy
and
dirty,
full
of
dirt
and
grit.
if
you'd
eat
it,
it
could
kill
you.some
of
them
are
bad
and
some
of
them
are
good.
they're
inspected,
washed,
cleaned,
salt
is
added,
weighed,
put
in
cans
and
run
down
the
line
and
canned
and
after
canning,
actually
sealing,
they
are
cooked
again,
plus
sterilized
so
that
they'll
keep
it.
now,
there
isn't
a
single
case
above
the
level
of
this
new
channel
case
at
all.
in
any
wise
at
all,
it's
helpful
to
the
court
in
this
case.
so
therefore,
even
though
the
court
says
they're
going
to
give
a
whole
lot
of
--
of
thought
to
the
administrative
ruling,
it's
got
to
go
back
on
the
english
language.
what
did
the
congress
mean?
they're
intelligent
people,
i
think.
i
think
they've
done
a
great
work
for
this
country,
since
they
were
first
organized
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
i
think
it
will
continue
that
great
work.
i'm
unafraid
of
them
because
they
are
answer
to
the
people
and
i
think
the
people
ordinarily
rewrite
it.
they
knew
that
they
were
saying,
“they
went
ahead
and
started
where
you
began
to
grow
oysters.”
and
they
came
to
the
wharf
where
you
unloaded
them.
and
then,
they
said
processing
other
than
canning.
now,
they
want
you.
i
haven't
got
time
enough
in
my
argument
here
today
to
go
into
all
of
it.
the
respondent,
the
labor
department,
want
you
to
ignore
that
comma
but
use
it
and
destroy
the
meaning
of
processing
and
say
that
processing
is
not
exempt
for
why
is
it
in
anywise
affected
by
canning.
now,
they
talk
about
time.
hiroshima
was
destroyed
in
about
a
half
of
a
second.
that
might
be
the
failure
to
work.
you
can
touch
a
button
a
day
and
it
will
ring
a
bell
in
london.
so,
in
a
little
bit,
if
they'll
little
both
talk
about
two
or
three
or
four
hours
destroying
the
meaning
of
the
word,
destroying
the
right
of
labor
of
the
people
to
make
the
inference
form
to
a
condition
that
the
men
who
were
legislating
knew
nothing
about
because
they,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
so
generous.
mr.
justice
douglas
is
a
great
traveler
but
nowhere
in
world
did
i
think
--
do
i
think
that
he
found
except
in
the
south
that
they
were
canning
oysters
and
shrimp
to
eat
it.
