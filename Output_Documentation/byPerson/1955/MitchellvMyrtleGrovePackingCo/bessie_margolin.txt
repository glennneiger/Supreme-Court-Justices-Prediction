ms.

may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
one
of
the
applicability
of
an
exemption
to
employees
engaged
in
picking
or
selling
shrimps
and
shucking
oysters
as
preparatory
too
and
immediately
before
they
are
placed
in
cans
for
hermetical
sealing.
the
question
is
whether
these
employees
are
completely
exempt
from
the
act
of
minimum
wage
and
overtime
exemption
aware
that
they
are
now
subject
to
the
minimum
wage
provisions
of
the
act
and
exempt
only
from
the
overtime
requirement
under
an
amendment
enacted
in
1949.
the
two
sections
of
the
act
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
which
are
involved
are
section
13
(a)
(5)
and
13
(b)
(4)
which
are
printed
in
our
brief.
13
(a)
(5)
was
the
section
in
the
act
that's
originally
enacted
which
granted
an
exemption
from
both
minimum
wage
and
overtime
provision
requirements
of
the
act
for
various
phases
of
seafood
processing
and
production,
including
propagating,
processing,
marketing,
freezing,
canning,
curing,
storing
or
distributing
of
seafood.
in
1949,
this
section
was
amended
so
that
the
word
canning
was
deleted
from
the
exempt
list
of
processes
and
a
new
provision
was
enacted,
13
(b)
(4),
providing
simply
an
overtime
exemption
--
exemption
from
the
overtime
requirements
only
for
any
employee
employed
in
the
canning
of
any
kind
of
fish.
at
the
same
time,
13
(a)
(5)
was
further
amended
by
inserting
as
to
the
word
processing
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
canning
was
being
deleted,
the
parenthetical
phrase
other
than
canning.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
employee
to
a
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
new
section
1949
is
only
an
overtime
exemption.
ms.
bessie
margolin
for
canning.
ms.
bessie

canning.
ms.
bessie
margolin
processing
other
than
canning
is
still
exempt
from
both
minimum
wage
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
and
overtime.
ms.
bessie
margolin
from
the
overtime
requirement.
the
question
is
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
whether
it's
processing
other
than
canning
or
other
than
canning.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
question
comes
up
because
the
fifth
and
the
fourth
circuits
were
in
direct
conflict
on
that
question.
this
case
comes
up
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
adopted
respondent's
contention
that
the
selling
and
picking
of
shrimp
and
shucking
of
oysters,
although
admittedly
in
this
case
for
all
practical
purpose
was
exclusively
purposes
of
canning
and
was
an
integrated
step
immediately
preceding
and
closely
and
continuously
integrated
profound
in
the
same
building
with
the
other
phases,
other
operations
of
the
canning,
although
in
a
separate
room
from
the
canning
room
or
the
packing
room
in
the
same
building
and
immediately
preceding
the
whole
process
from
the
time
the
oysters
are
dumped
on
the
table
and
that
the
shrimps
for
picking
--
shucking.
the
whole
process
from
that
time
through
the
hermetical
sealing
consumes
just
about
a
--
from
one
hour
to
two
hours
time.
it's
followed
immediately.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
now,
that
was
the
position
that
the
fifth
circuit
--
apparently,
the
reasoning
of
the
fifth
circuit
was
that
if
this
wasn't
processing
other
than
canning,
it
didn't
know
what
was
processing
other
than
canning
that
that
term
would
be
meaningless.
as
the
fourth
circuit
said
in
its
decision,
there
are
enumerable
scour
to
situation,
which
would
fit
the
term
processing
other
than
canning
even
apart
from
the
preparatory
operations
of
two
can.
one
that
the
--
that
--
we
mentioned
several
examples
in
our
brief.
justice
reed,
we
mentioned
the
menhaden,
the
rendering
of
oil
and
production
of
meal
from
the
menhaden
which
is
a
big
industry
in
this
country.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
one
of
the
specific
examples
that
was
mentioned
in
the
very
brief
legislative
debate
in
the
house
on
the
amendment.
they
were
very
brief
and
didn't
have
too
much
bearing
on
the
panel
enactment.
but
at
first,
it
was
proposed
to
take
both
processing
and
canning
out
of
the
13
(a)
(5),
the
complete
exemption
and
the
debate
simply
indicate
that
someone
objected
to
taking
processing
out
because
of
this
menhaden
situation,
mentioning
specifically
the
menhaden
situation,
so
that
the
--
as
it
came
out
of
the
conference
committee,
it
did
still
contain
the
work
processing
with
the
parenthetical
phrase
other
than
canning.
ms.
bessie
margolin
just
the
ones
that
--
that
dropped
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
probably
they
say
that
if
those
--
in
the
packing
room,
i
think,
i
don't
know
most
of
the
employees
at
the
canary,
all
this
shell
has
been
shucked.
here,
there
were
150
to
200
of
them.
i
don't
know
what
the
total
employment
here
was
but
our
best
advice
was
that
it
wasn't
much
over
200,
so
most
of
the
employees
at
the
canary
are
--
are
actually
the
pickers
and
shuckers.
there
are,
of
course,
some
employees
in
the
packing
room
that
the
record
doesn't
show
just
how
many.unpublished
statistics
show
that
in
the
oyster
and
canning
--
in
the
oyster
and
shrimp
canning
industry,
in
the
plants
from
75
to
90
--
90%
of
the
employees
are
those
that
do
the
peeling
and
shucking.
therefore,
the
exemption
so
far
as
oysters
and
shrimp
is
concerned,
the
--
the
extension
of
the
minimum
wage
provision
to
--
to
canning
would
have
very
little
meaning
if
they
didn't
cover
also
the,
perhaps,
pickers
and
--
and
shuckers.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
that
--
that
was
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
in
this
--
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
97.,
i
think,
6
percent
was
for
canning.
ms.
bessie
margolin
shrimp
and
oysters.
ms.
bessie
margolin
and
that
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
industry
as
a
whole
--
the
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
some
of
it
is
not
canned.
now,
in
the
original
fifth
circuit
case
which
where
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
was
actually
written
and
the
testimony
was
stipulated
by
agreement,
that
was
in
the
nature
that
was
friendly
suit.
it
was
stipulated
that
substantial
parts
of
it
were
not
canned,
that
some
of
it
was
fresh
frozen
--
fresh
packaged
are
frozen
and
sold.
and
the
fifth
circuit
there
did
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
reselling
and
the
shucking
might
not
necessarily
--
was
not
necessarily
for
canning
that
they
didn't
know
whether
it
was
going
to
be
frozen
or
canned.
however,
in
this
case,
where
it
was
admitted
and
conceded
that
virtually
all
of
the
--
that
the
practical
purposes
is
all
canning
and
mr.
(inaudible)
who's
their
partner
in
one
of
the
firms
and
a
direct
--
a
vice
president
of
the
other
testified
that
at
both
plants
now
they
are
doing
only
canning
that
the
frozen
--
the
fresh
--
the
frozen
meat
is
--
is
something
that's
only
done
sporadically
if
they
have
a
--
a
little
surplus
or
if
they
don't
have
enough
meat
for
canning.
they
sometimes
--
as
i
say
in
this
case,
it
came
through,
i
think
eighth-tenth
of
1%
that
was
frozen.
the
rest
is
--
was
sold.
it
was
oysters
sold
in
the
sacks
so
there
was
no
processing
of
that
at
all.
so
eight
--
i
think
it
was
eighth-tenth
of
1%
in
this
case
was
for
other
purposes
in
canning.
ms.
bessie
margolin
in
sacks,
i
think.
occasionally,
if
they
don't
get
enough
for
canning,
they'll
sell
a
sack
without
any
profit.
i'd
like
to
point
out
here
too
that
even
under
the
fifth
circuit's
apparent
reasoning
and
counsel
for
respondent
also
are
obvious.
apparently,
the
argument
is
that
it
has
to
be
exclusively
for
purposes
of
canning
and
that
it
can't
be
for
anything
else.
if
the
operation
could
possibly
be
for
something
other
than
canning
if
not
intended
to
be
part
of
canning.
now,
that
must
be
the
argument
because
it's
submitted
that
--
here
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
nothing
but
canning
was
done
at
this
plant.
that
--
that
argument,
i
might
point
out,
doesn't
hold
for
the
oysters
here
because
the
oysters
are
steamed
before
they
are
shucked
and
they're
steamed
only
if
they
are
to
be
canned.
so,
when
the
oysters
are
shucked
here,
they're
--
they
are
being
shucked
solely
and
exclusively
for
purposes
of
canning
because,
the
--
the
steaming
process,
which
precedes
it,
puts
them
in
that
position.
so
that
reasoning
could
not
possibly
apply
to
the
oysters
here
as
to
the
--
assuming
that
--
that
it
could
apply
to
the
shrimp,
i
think,
the
fourth
circuit
decision
is
obviously
the
correct
construction
of
--
of
the
statute
that
it's
conclusively
supported
by
the
legislative
history,
the
reports
of
the
conferee,
both
of
the
senate
and
the
house
specifically
stated
that
it
was
intended
to
include
the
preparatory
--
the
necessary
preparatory
operation
and
the
subsequent
operation
such
as
labeling.
we
quote
on
page
14
of
their
brief,
the
government's
brief,
the
pertinent
portions
from
the
reports
and
i
simply
call
attention
to
the
italicized
sentence
of
that
quotation,
which
states
specifically
that
canning
in
addition
to
meaning
hermetically
sealing
and
sterilizing
and
i'm
quoting,
“also
means
other
operations
profound
in
connection
therewith
such
as
necessary
preparatory
operation
profound
on
the
products
before
they
are
placed
in
bottles,
cans
or
other
containers
to
be
hermetically
sealed
as
well
as
the
actual
placing
of
the
commodity
in
such
containers.”
now,
we
believe
that
--
that
the
legislative
intent
couldn't
be
any
--
any
clearer
and
if
there's
very
little
room
for
further
argument,
i
might
just
conclude
by
saying
that
certainly
the
fourth
circuit's
construction
is
--
is
much
more
in
accord
with
the
established
principles
for
construing
this
statute
and
that
is
that
the
coverage
provisions
to
be
broadly
construed
and
the
exemption
provisions
now
be
construed.
and
the
fifth
circuit,
it
seems
to
us
they
are
exactly
the
opposite
of
that
whereas
the
fourth
circuit
applied
those
principles.
