mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you.
the
court
please.
the
decision
under
review
in
this
case
is
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
which
set
aside
by
a
split
decision
of
four-to-three,
an
arbitration
award.
the
award
had
been
made
by
the
board
of
arbitrators
in
favor
of
the
union
which
is
the
petitioner
here
through
two
individual
officers
and
against
the
cutter
laboratories
which
is
the
respondent
company.
and
this
award
directed
the
reinstatement
of
a
discharged
employee,
mrs.
doris
walker,
with
a
limited
amount
of
backpay.
under
california
law,
the
decisions
by
arbitrators
are
conclusive
on
the
merits,
both
on
findings
of
fact
and
determinations
of
law
subject
to
certain
very
limited
exceptions
which
i
need
not
go
into.
here,
the
california
courts
accepted
the
findings
of
the
arbitrators
but
set
aside
the
supreme
court,
set
aside
the
award
on
the
ground
that
enforcement
of
the
award
would
be
against
public
policy
as
expressed
in
both
federal
and
state
laws.
and
the
reason
why
they
said
it
was
against
public
policy
was
because
mrs.
walker
was,
as
the
arbitrators
found,
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
key
facts
which
were
found
by
the
arbitrators
were
these.
cutter
laboratories
manufactures
and
sells
throughout
the
united
states
biological
and
pharmaceutical
products.
it
has
both
military
customers
and
civilian
customers.
during
world
war
ii,
the
company
was
under
stringent
security
regulations
and
controlled
by
the
military
authority.
and
at
that
time,
the
government
had
the
right
to
require
cutter
laboratories
to
discharge
any
employee
as
a
security
risk,
although,
the
right,
in
fact,
never
had
to
be
exercised.
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
the
company
has
been
under
no
such
controls,
although,
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware
that
the
federal
government
has
a
very
expensive
program
of
so-called
industrial
security.
on
october
10,
1946,
doris
walker
got
a
job
at
cutter
laboratories,
she
was
hired
by
them.
she
was
first
a
label
clerk
and
then
toward
the
end
of
her
employment
became
a
clerk
typist
in
the
purchasing
department.
soon
after
she
was
hired,
mrs.
walker
became
active
in
the
petitioning
union
and
in
its
branch
at
cutter
laboratories
and
held
successively
various
positions
in
the
union.
by
october
of
1949,
which
is
the
date
in
which
mrs.
walker
was
discharged,
she
held
two
positions
in
the
union.
she
was
the
union's
chief
shop
steward
at
the
cutter
plant
and
she
was
also
president
of
the
union
local
which
included
branches
at
plants
other
than
cutter.
at
this
time
in
october
of
1949,
the
union
and
the
company
had
been
engaged
in
wage
negotiations
and
they
had
reached
at
the
particular
time,
more
or
less
of
an
in
pass.
these
negotiations
were
being
carried
on
under
a
wage
reopener
clause
in
an
existing
collective-bargaining
agreement.
on
october
5th,
1949,
mrs.
walker
met
as
a
union
representative
along
with
several
other
union
representatives,
with
some
of
the
top
officers
of
the
company
on
the
union
matter.
and
in
the
course
of
that
meeting,
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
company
expressed
anger
and
irritation
over
conduct
by
the
unions,
specifically
a
broadcast,
a
radio
broadcast
by
the
union
dealing
with
the
wage
negotiations
at
cutter.
that
was
october
5th,
1949.
the
very
next
day,
october
6th,
1949,
mrs.
walker
was
called
in
to
the
office
of
the
top
personnel
man
and
she
was
discharged.
to
quote
from
the
arbitrators'
award,
this
discharge
“was
the
discharge
of
top
union
official
and
negotiator
at
a
passionate
climax
in
the
middle
of
a
stubbornly
contested
wage
negotiation.”
at
the
time
of
the
discharge,
the
company
read
to
mrs.
walker,
a
prepared
written
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
reason
they
were
discharging
her
was
because
she
had
made
false
representations
on
her
application
for
employment
which
she
had
tooled
out
some
three
years
before.
because
the
company
was
convinced
as
a
result
of
an
investigation
that
she
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
the
nature
of
cutter's
business
required
the
company
to
take
precautions
against
sabotage
and
subversion.
that
very
same
day,
shortly
after
mrs.
walker
was
discharged,
the
company
called
a
meeting
of
the
employees
of
the
plant.
and
at
this
meeting,
it
read
the
discharge
clause
statement
which
it
had
read
to
mrs.
walker
who
was
the
president
of
the
union
at
this
plant.
at
the
same
meeting,
remarks
were
made
by
company
officials,
telling
employees
“get
out
of
that
left
wing
union”
and
saying
“nothing
but
a
left
wing
union
would
press
for
wage
increases
at
this
time.”
in
other
words,
and
now
i'm
making
my
own
comment
rather
than
the
arbitrators,
the
discharge
was
exploited
that
very
same
day
to
oppose
the
union's
demand
for
a
wage
increase.
as
the
arbitrators
found
during
the
entire
period
of
her
employment
of
some
three
years,
mrs.
walker's
conduct
and
performance
on
the
job
had
been
consistently
satisfactory
to
the
company.
and
at
no
time
had
there
been
at
the
cutter
plant
any
strike
or
any
interference
with
production
for
about
political
or
revolutionary
objective,
such
strike
or
activities,
there
had
been
--
had
clearly
been
legitimate
union
activity.
mrs.
walker
also,
as
the
arbitrators
found,
has
never
been
arrested
or
convicted
of
any
crime.
mrs.
walker's
discharge
after
exhaustion
of
the
contractual
grievance
procedure
went
to
arbitration
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
company
which
agreement
provided
for
binding
arbitration.
the
issue
before
the
arbitrators
was
whether
the
discharge
had
violated
two
particular
clauses
of
the
collective-bargaining
agreement.one
clause
prohibited
the
discharge
of
any
employee
except
for
just
cause.
and
the
arbitrators
construe
the
--
a
discharge
for
unjust
cause
to
mean
a
discharge
which
was
not
based
upon
grounds
reasonably
related
to
the
employee's
competence,
performance,
and
general
suitability
in
the
job.
that
was
one
issue
and
if
the
union
went
on
that,
mrs.
walker
had
to
be
reinstated.
an
alternative
and
the
second
issue
was
under
a
second
clause
of
the
contract
which
was
whether
the
discharge
was
based
upon
a
motive
by
the
company
to
interfere
with
union
activity.
the
union
charged
violations
of
both
clauses
of
this
contract.
at
the
arbitration
hearing,
the
company
took
the
position
that
it
discharged
mrs.
walker
for
the
two
reasons
that
it
had
given
mrs.
walker
when
it
discharged
her,
namely,
that
she
had
falsified
her
application
form
in
various
respects,
that
she
was
a
communist,
and
that
the
company
was
afraid
of
the
possibilities
of
sabotage
by
a
communist
employee.
mrs.
walker
admitted
and
the
arbitrators
found
that
she
had
falsified
her
employment
application
with
regard
to
her
education,
concealing
her
full
educational
background
and
substituting
a
fictitious
work
history
for
her
actual
work
history
and
that
she
had
done
this
because
she
felt
that
if
the
company
knew
that
she
was
overeducated
for
the
position,
if
it
knew
that
she
had
had
a
certain
work
experience
particularly
representing
labor
unions,
she
didn't
think
she
would
be
hired
as
a
typist.
i
may
say
that
actually
there's
no
real
issue
here
under
the
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
regarding
the
falsification
of
the
employment
application
in
any
respect.
the
real
question
comes
with
regard
to
the
claim
of
discharge
because
she
was
a
communist.
at
the
arbitration
hearing,
the
company
introduced
evidence
which
satisfied
the
arbitrators
that
mrs.
walker
was
a
communist
and
that
the
company
honestly
believe
that
she
was
a
communist.
mrs.
walker,
who
was
a
witness
at
the
hearing,
refused
to
answer
a
whole
series
and
string
of
questions
propounded
by
the
company's
lawyer
designed
to
establish
that
she
was
a
communist
and
very
--
and
they
devoted
an
act
of
communist,
her
refusal
was
on
the
grounds
that
these
questions
were
an
unwarranted
invasion
into
her
private
beliefs.
the
arbitrators
ruled
that
the
questions
were
material
but
said
they
would
not
require
the
witness
to
answer,
however,
coupling
that
with
the
warning
that
if
the
witness
did
not
answer,
then,
they,
the
arbitrators,
withdraw
all
justifiable
inferences
from
the
refusal
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
she
just
refused
from
the
grounds
that
this
was
her
private
beliefs,
it
was
not
of
the
company's
business,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
arbitration.
now,
the
arbitrators
eventually
concluded
from
the
record,
and
we
--
we
will
grant
that
this
court
has
to
accept
that
conclusion
whether
right
or
wrong
is
of
no
consequences
right
for
the
purposes
of
this
court.
the
arbitrators
eventually
concluded
from
the
record,
both
from
the
company's
evidence
and
from
the
refusals
to
answer,
that
mrs.
walker
was
a
communist.
they
therefore
held
that
they
had
not
deprived
the
company
of
any
rights.
the
company
has
not
been
prejudiced
by
their
refusal
to
direct
mrs.
walker
to
answer
the
questions
as
to
whether
she
was
a
communist,
because
they
said
that
would
just
had
been
corroboration
of
what
they
found
anyway,
therefore,
the
company
got
what
it
wanted.
nevertheless,
the
arbitrators
ruled
in
favor
of
the
union
and
they
held
that
mrs.
walker
had,
in
fact,
been
discharged
without
just
cause
and
because
of
her
participation
as
an
officer,
an
important
officer
in
union
negotiation.
now
going
into
the
details,
they
rested
these
conclusions
heavily
on
the
timing
of
a
discharge
on
the
fact
that
the
company
had
known
for
two
years
or
more
--
over
two
years
before
the
discharge
and
from
about
six
months
after
mrs.
walker
had
hired.
in
other
words,
they
had
known
her
for
two-and-a-half
years.
while
mrs.
walker
was
working
for
them,
the
company
had
known
these
facts
in
substance,
namely,
it
had
known
that
she
had
falsified
her
application
and
it
had
known
that
she
was
a
communist.
and
the
arbitrators
pointed
out
that
the
company
had
been
indifferent
to
these
facts
until
the
critical
union
negotiations
period,
they
found
that
the
grounds
actually
given
by
the
company
was
stale
that
they
were
not
the
true
grounds,
that
the
true
grounds
were
to
interfere
with
the
union
wage
negotiation.
when
the
company
refused
to
abide
by
the
award,
the
union
went
to
court
in
order
to
confirm
the
award
under
california
procedure.
the
superior
court
of
california
confirmed
the
award,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
affirmed.
the
supreme
court
of
california
reversed
four-to-three
holding,
as
i've
already
said,
that
enforcement
of
the
award
would
be
contrary
to
public
policy
because
of
these
communist
business.
mr.
joseph
forer
under
the
california
statutes,
awards
arbitration,
at
least
if
by
agreement
it
is
meant
to
be
binding,
must
be
enforced
by
the
california
courts
without
reviews
subject
to
very
limited
exceptions
such
as
corruption
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrators
or
that
they
exceeded
their
authority.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
now
also
held
and
that
is
an
obvious
--
they
must
be
accepted
by
this
court
that
the
california
courts
have
authority
to
refuse,
to
confirm
an
award
if
that
would
be
against
the
public
policy
of
the
state.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh,
yes.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
this
court
can
change
the
california
procedure
on
award.
at
this
point,
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
come
to
a
parting
of
the
ways.
we
brief
the
case
on
one
view,
they
brief
it
on
a
different
view.
as
we
understand
the
case,
we
say
that
the
state
court
refused
to
confirm
the
award
in
favor
of
the
union
to
reinstate
mrs.
walker
on
the
ground
that
mrs.
walker
was
a
communist
and
they
said
it
is
against
public
policy
to
allow
a
communist
to
work
in
private
industry,
and
we
say
that
is
clearly
unconstitutional.
the
respondent
doesn't
dispute
on
legal
argumentation
but
it
says
that
that's
not
applicable
to
the
facts.
it
says
that
what
actually
happened
is
that
the
board
of
arbitrators
found
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
interpreted
the
arbitration
award
as
finding,
not
that
mrs.
walker
was
just
a
member
of
the
communist
party
but
that
she
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
“with
the
full
implications
of
dedication
to
sabotage,
force,
violence
and
the
like
which
party
membership
is
believe
to
entail.”
the
quote
is
taken
from
the
arbitration
award
which
is
quoted
by
the
supreme
court's
opinion.
now,
this
language
concerning
--
mr.
joseph
forer
membership
in
the
communist
party
with
the
full
implications
of
dedication
to
sabotage,
force,
violence,
and
the
like
which
party
membership
is
believed
to
entail.
they
said
that
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
say
originally
the
quote
is
from
the
arbitrators'
report
and
then
the
supreme
court
of
california
referred
to
it.
what
they
say,
is
that
the
arbitrators
found
that
she
was
found
that
she
was
a
member
with
the
full
implications
of
dedications
to
sabotage,
which
communist
party
membership
is
believe
to
entail.
now,
this
language
is
regarding
full
implications,
seems
to
me
to
be
something
less
than
clear.
but
the
respondent's
argument
is
that
what
the
arbitrators
found
and
what
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
they
found
was
that
mrs.
walker
was
personally
dedicated
or
devoted
to
sabotage
in
violence
as
a
person.
and
they
say,
maybe
it's
unconstitutional
to
--
to
exclude
from
private
employment
a
person
just
because
she's
a
communist,
but
it
isn't
unconstitutional
to
exclude
a
communist
who
has
been
found
to
be
and
is
personally
dedicated
to
sabotage
and
violence.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
know.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
am
coming
to
that
because
that's
the
question.
i've
got
to
go
into
that.
i
--
if
you
will
bear
with
me
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
--
my
view
is
no,
their
view
is
yes,
and
it's
a
little
obscure.
and
if
you
will
bear
with
me,
i
will
be
coming
to
it
in
a
minute.
the
--
mr.
joseph
forer
on
what
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
it
matters
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
it
matters.
it
gives
me
a
much
easier
case,
a
much
different
case
to
argue,
matters
in
that
respect
that
makes
it
easier
case
for
your
honors
to
decide.
and
i
think
it
is
important
that
in
deciding
this
case
that
we
make
plain
just
what
is
being
decided,
and
that's
exactly
what
i
would
like
to
get
to
now.
in
other
words,
their
position
is
that
mrs.
walker
was
found
to
be
a
sabotage
addict.
like
they
had
narcotics
addicts,
they
say
she
was
a
sabotage
addict.
this
rest
on
a
single
passage
in
the
arbitrators'
report,
it's
the
first
two
paragraphs
at
--
at
the
top
of
page
29
of
the
record.
and
this
thus
refer
--
that
the
first
two
paragraphs
on
that
page
--
and
this
thus
refer
to
membership
in
a
communist
party
with
the
full
implications
and
dedication
to
sabotage,
force,
violence
and
the
like
which
party
membership
is
believe
to
entail.
and
then,
they
--
they
point
at
the
second
paragraph
it
says
that
the
company
honestly
believe
all
these
things
and
the
accuracy
of
those
beliefs
is
established
in
the
record
as
follows.
so,
they
say,
"well,
that
is
a
finding,"
that
it
not
only
believe
that
membership
--
that
membership
in
the
communist
party
had
full
implications
of
dedications
to
sabotage,
but
it
plead
that
that
belief
--
but
that
--
the
finding
to
that
belief
was
accurate.
i
must
say
that
--
that
if
you
try
to
read
those
two
key
paragraphs
literally,
all
you
get
is
sheer
gibberish
because
you
can't
see
how
the
accuracy
of
a
belief
about
the
nature
of
party
membership
has
anything
to
do
with
the
thing
which
immediately
follows
it
which
deals
with
omissions
and
falsification
on
the
application
for
employment,
nor
can
you
see
that
the
accuracy
of
a
belief
is
proven
by
the
last
clause
of
that
paragraph
that
the
belief
is
presently
understood
by
other
people.
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
people
share
a
belief
doesn't
mean
obviously
that
the
belief
is
accurate,
otherwise,
the
world
would
never
have
changed
from
flat
to
round.
now,
the
only
sensible
interpretation
of
the
passage
is
that
the
board
did
find
that
doris
walker
was,
in
fact,
a
communist
and
that
it
found
that
the
company
honestly
believe
that
she
was
a
communist
and
that
it
found
that
the
company
honestly
believe
than
what
is
a
prevalent
view
that
a
communist
is
a
person
who
is
dedicated
to
sabotage
force
and
violence.
you
just
can't
read
that
particularly
in
the
context
of
the
report
as
a
whole
as
anything
so
preposterous
as
a
finding
that
doris
walker
was
a
sabotage
addict.
mr.
joseph
forer
member
of
the
communist
party
--
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
i
mean
it
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
although,
as
your
honor
maybe
aware,
a
member
of
the
communist
party
also
has
a
very
loose
meaning.
mr.
joseph
forer
all
right.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
i
mean
member
of
the
communist
party.
as
i
say,
the
notion
that
an
arbitration
board
would
find
that
somebody
is
a
sabotage
addict
it's
strange
on
the
face
of
it.
this
board
wasn't
conducting
a
lunacy
inquisition,
it
was
conducting
an
ordinary
arbitration.
now,
the
true
meaning
of
the
passage,
is
what
i
say
it
means,
becomes
crystal
clear
when
you
look
at
the
report
as
a
whole
because
you
note
that
the
report,
although
it
compiles
the
evidence
very
exhaustively
including
all
the
evidence
of
mrs.
walker's
claimed
communist
party
membership,
recites
no
evidence
having
to
do
with
sabotage
or
force
or
violence
either
by
mrs.
walker,
by
the
communist
party,
by
any
communist
or
by
anybody
else.
and
to
us,
as
it
recite
any
predilection
or
any
evidence
showing
a
predilection
on
mrs.
walker's
part
for
such
activity.
furthermore,
the
questions
asked
by
mrs.
walker
of
the
company
and
which
she
refused
to
answer
and
from
which
the
arbitrators
said
they
might
draw
inferences,
those
questions
had
no
reference
to
sabotage
or
what.
now,
let
me
come
to
the
--
so
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
their
view
is
a
--
a
abates
point
which
makes
no
sense
in
reading
the
arbitration
award
and
i
must
say
that
even
--
that
you
can't
really
tell
what
the
full
implications
mean
anyway.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california.
they
say,
"well,
the
supreme
court
of
california
agreed
with
their
view
that
the
board
of
arbitrators
found
that
mrs.
walker
personally
was
a
sabotage
addict."
now,
in
the
majority
opinion,
the
court
on
one
occasion
paraphrasing
respondent's
argument
thus
refer
to
the
arbitrators
award
as
directing
reinstatement
of
a
member
of
the
communist
party
"who
is
dedicated
to
that
parties
program
of
sabotage,
force,
violence
and
the
like."
at
another
passage,
the
california
court
says
that
the
board
of
arbitrators
found
that
the
activity
engaged
in
by
mrs.
walker
was
"membership
in
the
communist
party
with
the
full
implications
of
dedication
to
sabotage
force,
violence
and
the
like
which
party
membership
is
believe
to
entail."
so
far,
it
sounds
like
they
have
a
point.
but
it
is
also
clear
from
the
opinion,
reading
the
opinion
as
a
whole
and
reading
other
passages
that
to
the
california
supreme
court,
the
conclusion
that
a
person
is
dedicated
to
sabotage
in
violence
is
the
automatic
and
inevitable
conclusion
from
a
statement
that
the
person
is
a
communist
at
least
to
these
--
has
physical
consciousness.
its
theory
was,
for
example,
and
this
appeared
from
the
opinion,
that
a
person
who
says
that
he
is
carrying
on
the
program
of
the
communist
party
and
the
--
the
company
introduced
a
letter
in
which
doris
walker
was
purporting
to
say
that
it
--
it
--
she
was
faithful
to
the
program
or
principle
of
the
communist
party.
its
theory
was
that
anybody
who
says
he's
faithful
or
carries
on
the
program
of
principles
of
the
communist
party
automatically,
thereby,
acknowledging
being
a
criminal
conspirator
and
a
saboteur.
it's
making
no
allowance
for
the
fact
that
the
view
of
the
person
making
the
statement
of
what
our
communist
principles
doesn't
necessarily
coincide
with
the
understanding
of
the
majority,
the
four
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
of
what
a
--
of
what
are
communist
principles.
again,
the
california
court
uses
communist
party
member
indistinguishably
with
a
--
a
person
who
is
dedicated
to
sabotage.
for
example
at
one
point
in
referring
to
the
finding
by
the
arbitrators,
the
california
court
said
that
the
board's
finding
was
that
the
company
"honestly
and
correctly
believe
mrs.
walker
to
be
a
knowing
and
deliberately
acting
communist."
and
another
point
it
said,
"every
communist
party
member
is
a
clear
and
present
danger,"
and
at
another
point
it
said,
"acts
of
sabotage
are
reasonably
to
be
expected
from
any
and
every
communist."
in
short,
the
california
court
majority
considered
that
doris
walker
was
and
was
found
to
be
dedicated
to
sabotage
and
violence,
merely,
because
it
thought
that
she
was
and
was
found
to
be
a
communist
in
possession
of
her
consciousness.
the
court
establishes
the
law
in
california.
the
proposition
that
all
communist
are
ipso
facto
without
the
need
for
proof,
personally
dedicated
to
sabotage
and
violence
unless
they
are
not
in
a
coma.
its
view
was
that
the
--
an
addiction
to
sabotage
was
the
inevitable
conclusion
from
the
finding
that
mrs.
walker
was
a
communist.
now
--
mr.
joseph
forer
the
--
the
thing
that
gave
doris
walker
the
right
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
to
be
reemployed
was
the
provision
in
the
contract,
plus
the
law
of
the
state
of
california
that
arbitration
to
enforce
a
contract
is
binding,
and
that
--
in
other
words,
you
can
contract
in
california
to
have
a
binding
arbitration
which
she
had
a
contractual
right
for
reinstatement.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
well,
actually,
of
course,
the
--
the
plaintiff
was
the
union.
the
union
had
the
contractual
right
to
have
her
reinstated.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
she
was
discharged
for
labor
union
activities.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
california
court
said
that
whether
she
was
discharged
for
union
activities
or
not,
she
couldn't
be
reinstated
because
it
is
against
public
policy
for
communist
to
hold
jobs
in
--
in
a
private
plant.
that's
what
the
california
--
mr.
joseph
forer
wait.
i
just
want
to
add
one
other
thing.
in
addition
to
that
it
said,
that
it
is
impossible
for
communist
to
engage
in
union
activities
because
even
when
they
are
engaging
in
union
activities,
they
are
still
communist.
now,
i
think
it
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
know
what
they
mean
except
they
--
they
took
the
view
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
communist
to
be
--
to
engage
in
union
activities
because
when
the
communist
engages
in
union
activities,
the
communist
is
doing
so
to
forward
communism.
that's
what
their
view
seems
to
be.
i
may
say
there
was
no
evidence
on
that
support,
that
--
that
again
they
say
that's
inevitable.
a
communist
can't
engage
in
union
activity.
that
--
mr.
joseph
forer
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
joseph
forer
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
had
just
made
the
argument
that
the
california
decision
violates
the
policy
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
it
says
that
certain
employees,
namely,
employees
who
were
communist
may
not
have
the
protection
of
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
or
the
protection
of
the
union
benefits.
where
as,
of
course,
the
act
doesn't
exclude
those
employees
from
those
benefits.
now
the
n.a.m.
brief
has
raised
the
point
of
which
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
respondent
had
briefed
in
their
brief
that
if
that
is
the
case,
then,
they
say
it
may
will
be
that
the
arbitration
award
to
its
void
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
that
the
whole
case
was
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
relying
on
the
garner
case.
that's
the
big
subject
in
itself
which
has
not
been
briefed
by
either
side
if
he
desires
a
brief
on
that
subject,
we
will,
of
course,
be
glad
to
supply
it.
but
i
think
it
--
it
may
be
enough
if
i
just
point
out
the
following
factors,
showing
that
the
garner
rule
doesn't
apply
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
arbitration
procedure
could
stand
or
has
an
independent
ground
of
jurisdiction
other
than
the
question
of
discharge
for
union
membership
and
that
is
because
one
of
the
issues
was
whether
the
discharge
was
not
for
just
cause.
in
the
second
place,
the
limitations
on
state
and
events
with
regards
to
picketing
or
strike
activity
or
secondary
boycott
activity
shouldn't
and
don't
apply
to
oust
state
remedies
for
violations
of
a
collective-bargaining
contract.
on
the
contrary,
that
would
frustrate
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
promote
collective-bargaining
which,
if
it
is
successful,
culminates
in
a
contract.
now,
if
this
contract
then
can't
be
enforced
by
the
ordinary
remedy,
then,
this
purpose
is
largely
frustrated.
and
in
fact,
it
is
standard
union
company
dealings
that
when
you
do
have
a
contract,
it
is
customary
to
have
the
provisions
against
discharges
without
just
cause
and
discharges
for
union
activities.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
conference
report
on
the
taft-hartley
act
says
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“once
parties
have
made
a
collective-bargaining
contract,
the
enforcement
of
that
contract
should
be
left
to
the
usual
processes
of
the
law
and
not
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.”
and
if
you
look
at
section
203
(d)
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
that's
the
section
dealing
with
the
federal
mediation
service,
there's
an
expressed
statement
that
adjustment
of
labor
disputes
by
a
method
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
is
the
desirable
method
for
settling
grievance
disputes.
and
again
congress
showed
their
intention
to
have
traditional
contractual
remedies
applied
through
the
courts.
once
the
collective-bargaining
contract
had
been
entered
into
by
expanding
a
federal
court
jurisdiction
so
as
to
permit
suits
against
labor
unions
under
section
301
of
the
act
without
regard
to
diversity
and
not
the
controversy
and
so
forth.
in
other
words,
the
act
shows
that
there
is
a
policy
of
the
act
in
favor
of
utilizing
traditional
state
remedies,
traditional
judicial
remedies
for
enforcement
of
collective-bargaining
agreement.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
recognizing
this
fact,
the
labor
board
itself
has
established
a
policy
of
refusing
the
process
cases
involving
alleged
discharges
for
union
activity
where
there
is
a
collective-bargaining
contract
with
a
binding
arbitration
procedure
available
as
there
was
here,
so
that
the
alleged
discharged
union
activity
could
be
arbitrated.
as
i
say
we
haven't
briefed
this.
i
would
therefore
like
to
cite
a
note
which
does
cover
the
subject
and
does
give
the
--
the
labor
board
decisions
that
i
have
just
referred
to.
it's
a
note
that
69
harvard
law
review
beginning
at
page
725.
now
there
is
one
other
respect
in
which
the
california
decision
engaged
a
federally
occupied
field.
the
internal
security
act,
the
constitutionality
of
which
among
other
things
is
now
pending
and
--
and
it's
under
consideration
by
this
court
as
the
court
is
aware.
that
act
prohibits
members
of
a
communist
action
organization
from
holding
employment
in
defense
facilities
designated
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
now
the
california
court
has
gone
beyond
that
act
and
it
has
excluded
communist
from
employment
in
nondefense
facility.
but
if
there's
a
greater
conflict
and
inconsistency
than
that,
in
the
internal
security
act,
congress
expressly
provided
that
the
employment
exclusion
sanction
should
be
withheld
until
the
registration
order
of
the
board
against
the
communist
party
became
final
by
affirmance
by
this
court
if
this
court
have
does
affirmed
it.
and
it
allowed
an
escape
opportunity
for
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
get
out
of
the
employment
sanction
by
leaving
the
communist
party.
but
it
was
very
careful
to
allow
this
state
opportunity
to
exist
after
all
judicial
review
had
been
exhausted
in
the
communist
party
case.
now,
the
court
may
remember
that
that
fact,
the
fact
that
there
was
an
escape
opportunity
allowed
after
all
judicial
review
was
exhausted,
was
relied
on
very
heavily
in
the
oral
argument
in
the
communist
party
case.
why
the
solicitor
general
as
saying
that
this
preserves
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
because
it
means
that
a
communist
without
guilty
knowledge
are
in
subject
to
the
employment
sanction
of
the
act.
but
the
california
court,
in
this
decision,
purporting
to
apply
a
policy
which
it
derived
in
part
from
the
internal
security
act
has
applied
the
employment
sanction
without
allowing
that
opportunity
for
escape
because
that
opportunity
for
escape
after
this
court
affirms
if
it
does,
still
hasn't
arisen.
and
this
particular
plant,
cutter
laboratories,
for
all
anybody
knows,
may
or
may
not
be
eventually
be
designated
as
a
defense
facility
by
the
secretary
of
defense.
that
the
secretary
of
defense
simply
has
not
designated
it.
so
far
as
i
am
aware,
the
list
of
defense
facilities
from
which
members
of
communist
action
organization
are
excluded
by
virtue
of
the
internal
security
act.
