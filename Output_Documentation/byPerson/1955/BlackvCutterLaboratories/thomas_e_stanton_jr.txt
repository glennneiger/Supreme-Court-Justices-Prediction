mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
if
the
court
please.
mr.
johnson
made
it
very
clear
that
as
these
briefs
have
developed
and
as
these
legal
arguments
have
been
presented
to
you
in
the
briefs.
the
clash
has
been
on
facts
rather
than
more
of
law.
they
haven't
answered
the
arguments
that
we
have
made
of
course
and
the
points
that
they
make
we
have
claimed
in
the
briefs
and
we
feel
for
their
grievance
that
are
set
forth
there
then
just
not
in
--
present
in
this
record
because
there
was
no
dispute,
mr.
johnson
has
brought
out
and
as
it's
clearly
stated
in
the
arbitrators
award
as
to
what
we
claimed,
are
words
the
claim
--
straight
claim
was
made
that
we
claim
that
she
was
a
communist
with
the
full
implications
and
i'm
reading
from
page
27.
the
company's
position
is
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
demonstrates
beyond
question
that
doris
walker
is
not
merely
a
conspirator
but
a
traitor
and
an
enemy
of
the
country,
and
in
the
finding
of
the
arbitrator
which
is
made
on
page
29,
a
statement
is
made
assuming
and
referring
to
doris
walker's
answers.
assuming
their
answers
would
have
been
favorable
to
the
company's
position,
they
would
serve
no
more
than
to
corroborate.
what
we
find
is
already
established
by
the
record
and
the
company
offers
no
convincing
reason
why
further
corroboration
is
necessary.
the
arbitrator
--
this
matter
that
has
been
argued
to
you
by
petitioners
here
was
argued
before
the
california
supreme
court,
very
much
at
length
as
to
the
interpretation
of
that
finding
and
as
to
its
meaning
and
we
feel
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
that
matter
has
been
solid
for
this
court
because
the
california
supreme
court
in
several
places,
the
very
outset
of
their
opinion,
which
is
on
page
469
of
the
record.
we
have
concluded
that
upon
the
undisputed
evidence
and
upon
the
facts
found
by
the
arbitration
board
the
company
is
correct
in
its
contention
if
the
arbitrators
exceeded
their
powers
that
the
award
is
contrary
to
law
and
that
would
contravene
public
policy
for
the
court's
of
this
state
to
enforce
reinstatement
of
the
discharged
employee.
and
there
are
other
references
in
which
the
court
states
as
exact
holding,
but
we
were
contending
at
page
478
as
they
start
their
opinion,
they
say
as
ground
for
reversal
of
the
camp
--
as
ground
for
reversal,
the
company
contends
among
other
things
and
as
it
contended
before
the
trial
court
in
seeking
vacation
of
the
award
that
an
arbitration
award
which
directs
that
a
member
of
the
communist
party
who
is
dedicated
in
that
party's
program
of
sabotage,
force,
violence
and
the
like,
be
reinstated
to
employment
in
a
plant
which
produces
antibiotics
used
by
both
the
military
and
civilians
is
against
public
policy
as
expressed
in
both
federal
and
state
laws.
therefore,
illegal
and
void
and
will
not
be
enforced
by
the
courts.
with
this
contention,
we
agree.
now
what
was
being
done
in
this
case
was
the
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
a
state
statute,
a
state
remedy.
the
california
supreme
court
in
prior
decisions
which
are
cited
in
the
brief,
had
held
that
this
was
an
equitable
remedy,
that
the
parties
were
entitled
to
enforcement
of
the
award
only
if
a
court
of
equity
would
grant
such
enforcement.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
no
evidence
--
sir?
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
the
evidence
that
was
placed
before
the
arbitration
board
as
detailed
by
mr.
johnson,
this
letter
in
her
own
handwriting,
she
refused
to
identify.
the
fact
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
oh
it
goes
beyond
that
your
honor.
here
was
a
person
who
is
an
attorney,
who
abandoned
the
career
of
the
law
to
enter
a
plant.
and
when
she
was
asked
the
direct
and
specific
question
as
the
supreme
court
points
out
at
the
conclusion
of
its
opinion,
did
you
seek
that
employment
for
the
purpose
of
becoming
more
active
and
carrying
more
effectively
the
communist
party
program.
she
refuses
to
answer
that
question
and
she
refused
to
answer
other
questions
which
purport
--
i
mean
which
are
directed
at
the
contention
we
were
making
in
argument
and
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
before
the
arbitration
board.
we
made
it
clear
what
we
trying
to
establish
and
this
lady,
without
any
claim
of
constitutional
right,
she
had
no
right
to
claim,
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
because
she
had
waived
those
rights.
she
came
before
that
arbitration
board
and
as
the
record
shows,
she
testified
to
her
motif
in
leaving
the
practice
of
the
law.
she
said
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
the
labor
movement.
she
testified
to
her
motive
for
making
this
application
--
misrepresentations
in
her
application
blank.
she
said
that
they
--
because
there
was
--
they
were
for
the
reason
that
she
could
--
have
to
have
a
job
to
eat,
but
the
arbitration
board
did
not
infer
that
that
was
a
fact
and
they
inferred
that
the
purpose
was
to
get
into
the
cutter
plant,
to
become
active
in
the
union,
to
achieve
high
position
in
the
union
and
to
--
all
with
the
objective
of
carrying
on
the
program
of
the
communist
party.
and
we
placed
an
evidence
of
this
report
which
was
written
less
than
three
months
before
she
took
a
job
with
--
took
her
position
with
the
cutter
plant,
and
made
this
misrepresentations
and
which
said
that
she
violated
everything
she
did
from
the
point
of
view
in
strengthening
the
the
party.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
no,
your
honor
because
our
point.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well
i
--
i
want
to
make
that
point
clear,
that
what
the
supreme
court
held
was
we
have
before
us
an
arbitration
board
finding
of
fact
that
she
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
with
the
full
implications
of
dedication
of
force,
violence,
sabotage.
those
were
the
words
of
the
arbitration
board
and
they
said,
we
have
been
asked
to
lend
the
force
of
the
law,
the
power
of
the
state
of
california
to
enforce
that
award.
we
have
been
told
by
the
petitioners,
the
people
were
coming
in
for
this
relief
that
we
cannot
review
that
finding
or
any
other
finding
of
the
arbitration
board.
that
we
are
concluded
by
a
finding,
and
they
say
and
they
draw
specific
authorities
they
had
decided
only
a
few
years
before
that
the
california
court
is
not
helpless
when
its
presented
with
the
finding
of
that
nature.
when
there
is
a
finding
which
a
court
concludes
is
against
public
policy,
they
have
a
duty
and
the
power
under
the
statute
to
withhold
enforcement
of
that
award.
and
they
refer
your
honor
--
they
refer
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
to
the
findings
of
congress
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
out
the
full
implications
of
party
membership,
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
the
public
policy.
that
is
why
they
refer
to
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
if
--
i
have
to
carry
one
further
justice
reed.
if
the
finding
is
that
she
was
seeking
reemployment
to
carry
on
the
--
she
saw
the
employment
originally
and
she
was
seeking
reinstatement
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
the
program
of
the
communist
party.
in
other
words
in
the
facts
as
they
are
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court
and
as
they
are
presented
to
this
court,
we
submit
the
case
of
a
contract,
an
action
that
was
in
pursuant
of
the
communist
party
conspiracy.
and
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
i
want
to
make
that
very
clear
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
i
think
you're
correct
in
the
timing.
it
was
communist
party
versus
peek
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
as
we
see
it,
your
honor
it
has
no
bearing
because
as
we
see
it,
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
take
judicial
notice
of
the
implications
of
the
--
that
the
communist
party
was
dedicated
with
force
and
violence.
it
was
upholding
the
finding
of
an
arbitration
board.
now
the
arbitration
board
may
have
taken
judicial
notice
but
we
take
the
position,
your
honor
that
they
had
sufficient
to
go
on
in
the
findings
of
the
legislature
and
to
other
things.
the
decisions
of
the
court
up
to
the
point
that
they
made
the
decision
which
justified
their
inferences
and
that
was
what
they
were.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
your
honor
i
do
not
consider
that
this
case
overrules
that
position
or
passes
on
that
position
because
as
the
matter
came
to
the
united
--
to
the
lower
court,
it
wasn't
called
upon
to
take
judicial
notice.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
476.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
are
you
reading
from
page
476?
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
what
portion
of
it?
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well
i'm
sorry
i
can't
find
the
finding
language
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
the
remainder
of
the
opinion
makes
very
clear
that
there
is
significance
of
that
term
correctly,
in
other
words,
the
company
honestly
believed
and
the
company
correctly
believed.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor
and
if
that
not
only
was
their
belief
right
but
the
fact
was
such.
that
it
was
correct,
in
other
words
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
and
that
they
were
correct
in
that
belief.
in
other
words,
the
fact
was
so.
well
if
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
but
what
more
did
they
need
to
find
to
find
as
i
say
they
find
and
that
is
that
the
fact
was
that
she
was
--
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
yes,
dedicated
to
the
force
and
violence.
mr.
thomas
e.
stanton,
jr.
well,
not
at
that
point,
your
honor
but
in
other
parts
of
the
opinion.
