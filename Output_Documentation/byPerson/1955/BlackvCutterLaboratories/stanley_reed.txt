yes.
i
was
wondering
that
it
--
perhaps
the
contract
that
the
union
had
with
cutter
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
provided
for
reinstatement
only
when
they
had
been
discharged
from
union
activities?
justice
stanley
reed
now,
the
supreme
court
overturned
that?
justice
stanley
reed
they
said
she
was
discharged
at
least
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
discharge
was
this
false
representation
that
she'd
made?
justice
stanley
reed
i
don't
want
to
(inaudible)
on
that.
that
seems
very
clear
to
me
is
what
you're
saying
is
that
it
is
against
the
public
policy
of
california
as
provided
by
supreme
court
to
employ
or
require
the
employment
of
a
communist
under
a
labor
contract
in
the
cutter
laboratories.
