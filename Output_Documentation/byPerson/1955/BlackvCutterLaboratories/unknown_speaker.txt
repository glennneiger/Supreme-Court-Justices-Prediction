unknown
speaker
what
--
what
gave
this
lady
the
right
to
be
reemployed?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
that
--
that
contractual
right
to
the
labor
agreement
that
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
and
--
and
she
was
employed
under
that
contract?
unknown
speaker
and
she
was
discharged
for
labor
union
activities?
unknown
speaker
now,
the
california
court
didn't
agree
with
you
on
that
supreme
court,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
--
i'm
looking
at
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
they
--
what
did
they
mean
in
that
part
of
the
opinion
when
they
said,
"her
activities
therefore,
upon
any
reasonable
view
of
evidence,
the
findings
of
the
fact
were
not
union
activities
but
were
communist
party
activities."
unknown
speaker
well,
i
--
i
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
contract
provided
as
i've
said
at
the
beginning,
mr.
justice
reed,
there
were
two
clauses
that
the
discharge
violated.
one,
was
discharge
of
any
employee
without
just
cause.
and
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
or
without
union
activities.
and
doris
walker
was
found
by
the
arbitrators
to
be
discharge
without
just
cause
and
that
the
reason
action
given
was
a
fake.
and
then
in
addition
to
that,
it
was
found
that
she
was
also
fired
in
violation
of
the
contractual
prohibition
against
firing
to
interfere
union
activities.
unknown
speaker
yes.
they
overturned
it
on
the
grounds
that
--
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
the
--
the
company
said
that
the
false
representation
was
one
of
the
grounds
for
discharge.
the
arbitrators
found
that
that
was
not
a
true
ground
and
had
been
waived
and
that
finding
was
not,
in
anyway,
overturned
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
may
i
--
let's
say
i
think
that
false
representation
just
added
the
case.
let
me
go
back.
the
reasoning
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
every
communist
who
was
not
in
a
coma
is
a
--
a
sabotage
addict
makes
the
question,
the
one
which
we
see
it
and
not
the
one
which
the
respondent
says
is
the
case.
in
other
words,
the
award
was
denied
confirmation
on
the
theory
that
doris
walker
is
a
communist
by
california
law,
all
communist
are
conclusively
presumed
to
be
personally
addicted
to
sabotage
and
violence
and
this
--
and
not
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
evidence
and
the
arbitrators
found
that
aside
from
this
legal
presumption
of
the
nature
of
communist
that
doris
walker
was
a
sabotage
risk.
but
even
if
the
california
court
held
and
now
i'm
coming
to
the
second
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
presented.
but
even
if
the
california
court
held
that
the
arbitrators
found
that
mrs.
walker
was
personally
addicted
to
sabotage,
that
folding
is
not
binding
on
this
court.
and
even
if
the
arbitrators
so
held,
that
holding
is
not
binding
on
this
court.
although,
as
i
say,
the
only
sensible
interpretation
of
the
finding
is
that
wasn't
so
found
and
the
only
sensible
interpretation
of
the
opinion
is
that
that
wasn't
so
held.
but
going
under
a
theory,
the
findings
and
construction
in
that
respect
would
not
be
binding
on
this
court
because
the
question
of
constitutional
right,
a
question
of
the
invasion
of
doris
walker's
constitutional
right
is
here
involved.
and
if
the
court
examines
the
evidence
before
the
arbitrators,
all
of
which
is
printed
in
the
record,
it
is
impossible
to
find
any
evidence
that
doris
walker
was
personally
addicted
to
force
and
violence
or
sabotage
or
any
evidence
that
anybody
else
was
or
believe
in.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
as
i
said
earlier
that
none
of
the
question
asked
of
her
related
to
the
subject.
the
basic
question
which
this
case
raises
then
is
this.
may
the
state
announce
and
implement
a
public
policy
that
communist
should
not
be
employed
in
private
industry.
in
this
particular
case,
the
public
policy
was
implemented
by
refusing
to
confirm
an
arbitration
award
which
under
california
law
would
have
been
confirmed
and
thus
enforce
for
any
non-communist.
but
if
the
principle
of
this
particular
implementation
is
sound,
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
same
public
policy
that
communist
are
not
allowed
to
work
could
be
implemented
further
as
for
example
by
state
legislation
making
it
a
crime
for
communist
to
work
in
private
industry
or
for
communist
to
be
hired
by
private
industry.
this
public
policy
that
communists
are
unemployable
was
applied
in
this
case,
even
though
the
particular
immediate
victim
did
not
had
a
sensitive
job
but
was
just
a
typist
in
the
purchasing
department.
it
was
applied
even
though
the
employer
was
not
a
defense
claim,
now,
it's
true
that
the
company's
products
and
operations
are
susceptible
to
sabotage
but
what
plant
is
not.
this
public
policy
was
applied
even
though
its
immediate
victim
was
never
convicted
of
any
crime
and
without
any
evidence
that
she
personally,
actually
engaged
in
or
advocated
sabotage
or
violence.
it
was
applied
even
though
the
victim
never
had
a
trial
by
jury
or
any
other
kind
of
a
judicial
trial
and
even
though
the
employer
as
the
arbitrators
found
were
willing
to
retain
it
though
she
was
a
communist
but
they
fired
her
because
she
was
a
union
official.
now,
i
say
that
due
process
and
equal
protection
prohibits
to
state
from
applying
the
policy
that
communist
are
not
allowed
to
work
in
private
industry,
particularly
on
the
completely
undiscriminating
basis
that
was
applied
here.
moreover,
i
say
the
manner
in
which
this
policy
was
applied
in
this
case
that
is
where
the
edict
that
doris
walker
is
an
unemployable
person
was
issued
without
evidence
and
without
a
judicial
trial,
that
violates
procedural
due
process.
the
right
of
doris
walker
to
work
in
private
industry
which
means
her
ability
to
eat
is
an
essential
right
vital
to
the
preservation
of
life
itself.
unknown
speaker
yes.
she
was
a
lawyer.
she
left
--
let
me
go
to
that
as
i
say
--
unknown
speaker
alright.
the
lady
was
a
lawyer.
she
wanted
to
be
a
labor
lawyer.
she
got
frustrated
because
she
couldn't
find
work
as
a
labor
lawyer,
she
decided
to
become
an
ordinary
worker,
and
she
did.
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
state
cannot
deny
doris
walker
the
right
to
be
employed,
while
other
people
enjoy
the
right
to
be
employed,
without
some
strong
compelling
rational
basis
for
classifying
doris
walker
as
an
--
as
unemployable.
and
it
can't
deprive
her
of
access
to
judicial
remedies
which
are
available
for
litigants
generally
and
they
can't
deprive
her
of
the
benefits
of
union
representation,
all
of
which
is
been
done
here,
merely
because
she
is
a
communist.
anymore
than
as
this
court
held
last
monday,
the
state
of
illinois
could
deny
access
to
an
appellate
court
to
people
merely
because
they
were
invisible.
now,
under
the
due
process
clause,
the
state
may
not
deprive
doris
walker
of
this
essential
right
to
earn
a
living,
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
union
representation
unless
there
is
a
compelling
rational
basis
for
the
deprivation
relating
to
her,
not
to
the
communist
party
but
relating
to
her,
and
unless
a
fair
procedure
was
employed
to
achieve
that
deprivation.
there
is
and
can
be
no
such
basis
here.
the
california
court
is
ruled
that
there
is
conclusive
presumption
that
doris
walker
is
unemployable
and
unfit
for
union
representation,
because
being
a
communist,
she
is
necessarily
personally
addicted
to
sabotage.
let
me
quote
one
passage
from
the
opinion
at
page
--
the
record
at
488,
"that
acts
of
sabotage
by
communist
are
reasonably
to
be
expected.
at
anytime
such
acts
maybe
directed
by
the
party
leader
is
not
open
to
question."
doris
walker
couldn't
question
that
if
she
were
a
communist,
she
was
necessarily
addicted
to
sabotage.
this
presumption
was
erected
without
any
evidence
to
support
it
as
to
doris
walker
personally
or
for
that
matter
as
anybody
else,
and
it
was
applied
without
a
judicial
trial
for
doris
walker.
doris
walker
has
been
caught
in
a
mass
adjudication
of
group
criminality.
this
is
not
and
cannot
be
due
process,
substantive,
or
procedure.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
evidentiary
presumptions
violate
due
process
if
they
had
no
rational
basis
in
common
experience
and
if
they
are
not
subject
for
rebuttal
by
evidence.
here,
the
presumption
was
made
without
evidence
and
it's
not
subject
to
rebuttal
but
is
conclusive
on
doris
walker,
and
on
anybody
else
who
happens
to
be
or
is
believed
to
be
a
communist.
and
that
basis
furthermore
has
no
rational
--
that
finding,
that
presumption
has
no
rational
basis
and
it
has
no
basis
in
common
experience.
it
is
not
rational
and
it
does
not
accord
with
common
experience,
to
hold
that
all
communist
in
california
or
anywhere
else
corresponds
to
the
stereotype
of
a
communist
which
has
been
erected
by
the
enemies
of
communist.
it
is
not
rational
and
there
is
no
experience
basis
from
which
to
conclude
that
every
communist
in
california
or
anywhere
else,
every
communist
is
addicted
to
sabotage
and
violence.
as
matter
of
fact,
it
is
not
rational
to
conclude
on
the
basis
of
experience
that
most
communist
or
many
communist
are
so
addicted.
the
supreme
court
of
california
didn't
cite
any
instances
of
sabotage
inside
of
california
or
anything
else
to
prove
that
communist
commits
sabotage,
and
therefore
doris
walker
is
prone
to
sabotage.
all
it
cited
were
animate
versions
against
communism
in
legislation
and
various
opinions.
if
all
communist
in
capitalistic
countries
are
saboteurs,
it
is
impossible
to
explain
how
a
factory
remain
standing
in
such
countries
as
italy
and
france.
this
country
was
--
this
court
was
met
with
an
argument
in
stack
against
boyle,
that
all
communist
or
points
of
the
communist
party
which
is
a
criminal
conspiracy
and
that
they're
so
likely
to
flee
justice
if
the
party
leader
tells
them
to
flee
that
when
they're
arrested
under
the
smith
act
they
have
to
be
put
on
prohibitive
bail.
the
court
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
vinson
repudiated
that
argument
and
had
held
that
communist
like
everybody
else
under
our
constitution
are
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
proven
guilty,
and
that
they
must
be
personally
and
individually
judged.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
doris
walker
has
been
attainted
on
the
basis
of
a
policy
that
makes
absolutely
no
sense
at
all
in
any
respect.
communist
are
people,
people
different.
if
people
are
going
to
live
together,
there
has
to
be
somewhere,
some
limit.
on
the
precautions,
it
can
be
taken
to
exclude
people
from
society
on
the
grounds
that
someday,
some
place,
somehow,
they
may
do
something
bad
like
throwing
a
bomb.
otherwise,
you
just
have
this
terrible
injustice
and
all
of
association
gets
disrupted.
you
can't
in
california
permit
the
--
a
crowd
to
go
to
the
rose
bowl
game
without
giving
everybody
a
bombing
test
because
somebody
might
throw
a
bomb.
on
this
record,
there
is
no
--
and
on
any
record
on
any
theory,
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
this
discrimination
against
doris
walker,
and
therefore,
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process.
this
violation
is
particularly
acute
here
because
it
occurs
in
an
area
of
first
amendment
right.
on
this
record,
doris
walker
has
been
declared
unemployable
solely
because
of
her
unpopular
political
beliefs
and
associations
though
she
has
never
committed
a
crime
without
a
judicial
trial.
in
the
schneiderman
case,
in
--
however,
some
members
of
the
court
may
disagree
with
the
final
holding
of
the
schneiderman
case
but
one
thing
is
indisputable.
in
the
schneiderman
case,
both
the
majority
and
the
minority
recognized
that
it
was
possible
that
the
leading
communist
in
california,
mr.
schneiderman,
the
secretary
of
the
california
--
of
the
party
in
california,
it
was
possible
that
he
--
the
leading
communist
in
california
could
be
attach
to
the
constitution
and
could
be
well
dispose
to
the
peace
and
well-being
of
the
united
states.
and
that
it
was
possible
that
no
matter
what
official
communist
party
doctrine
might
be
that
this
leading
official
didn't
necessarily
advocate
doctrines
of
force
and
violence.
the
california
court
says
that
isn't
possible.
it
says
it
is
impossible
for
any
communist
unless
he
is
completely
unconscious
not
to
be
a
saboteur
and
a
traitor
and
it
made
this
decision
not
on
the
basis
of
evidence
introduced
in
a
trial
but
on
the
basis
of
a
political
climate,
ex
parte
and
on
aversions
against
communism
and
it's
perfectly
clear
on
the
basis
of
a
personal
and
political
prejudices
of
the
four
judges
who
constituted
the
majority.
when
this
court
upheld
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
(inaudible)
it
recognized
that
the
non-communist
affidavit
provision
reached
the
brink
of
unconstitutionality
under
the
first
amendment,
but
it
sustained
9
(h)
on
the
grounds
that
it
didn't
do
very
much
to
communist
or
to
their
first
amendment
rights.
it
said
it
only
touch
a
handful
of
communist
that
it
didn't
deter
a
party
membership
as
such,
that
the
only
persons
affected
were
people
--
were
communists
who
were
in
a
position
of
power
over
the
nations
economy.
all
these
reservations
have
been
swept
aside
in
california
which
now
holds
that
any
communist
cannot
hold
any
position
in
private
industry
no
matter
how
meaningful.
the
rationality
of
this
public
policy
erected
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
is
underscored
by
the
source
from
which
it
derived
that
policy.
it
relied
on
chiefly
on
various
states
in
federal
legislation.
among
the
state
legislation
relied
on
was
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
law.
but
this
statute
is
not
in
effect,
it
violates
the
supremacy
clause
as
it
clearly
appears
form
this
court's
decision
recently
in
the
steve
nelson
case.
so
we
have
case
of
public
policy
derived
in
part
from
superseded
legislation
which
violates
the
supremacy
clause.
among
the
federal
legislation
relied
on
is
the
smith
act,
and
the
smith
act
doesn't
say
anything
about
communist
or
communism.
it
is
after
for
--
only
the
persons
who
are
convicted
at
the
trial
by
jury,
after
having
a
presumption
of
innocence
apply
of
personally
advocating
violent
overthrow
of
the
government,
personally
conspiring,
so
to
advocate
or
belonging
to
an
organization
knowing
that
it
advocates
violent
overthrow.
from
this
legislation
itself
on
the
edge
of
unconstitutionality,
it
was
irrational
for
the
california
court
to
distill
the
proposition
that
communist
can
be
punish
without
trial,
without
evidence,
without
the
presumption
of
innocence,
without
regard
to
personal
innocence
and
despite
a
lack
of
guilty
now.
the
california
court
had
solved
one
of
the
smith
act
problems.
there's
been
a
problem
under
the
smith
act
of
whether
--
of
whether
communist
can
get
fair
trial.
it
solved
the
problem,
it
says
don't
give
him
any
trial
at
all.
this
whole
thing
is
so
irrational
that
--
that
it
--
it
reaches
a
--
a
level
which
is
obnoxious.
if
all
communist
are
alike
--
if
all
communist
made
anytime
a
drop
of
bomb,
i
suppose
it
would
be
reasonable
if
mr.
sean
o'casey
who
was
a
communist
in
a
capitalist
country
and
picasso
who
is
a
communist
in
a
capitalist
country,
i
suppose
it
would
be
reasonable
to
lock
them
up
because
they
might
go
to
a
theater,
they
might
go
to
an
art
gallery,
they
might
throw
a
bomb,
they
therefore
dangerous.
i
say
that
no
such
thing
can
stand.
this
whole
thing
is
a
clear
violation
of
due
process
and
equal
protection.
let
me
now
turn
to
my
second
point,
and
that
is
that
this
public
policy
which
has
been
applied
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
which
was
invented
by
it
cannot
stand
because
it
violates
federal
policy
and
federal
enactments.
and
the
first
of
these
is
the
federal
policy
created
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
taft-hartley
act
in
the
interest
of
protecting
interstate
commerce.
the
decision
below
holds
that
communists
are
not
entitled
to
the
protection
of
union
representation
or
the
protection
of
a
collective-bargaining
contract,
because
if
a
union
can't
make
a
contract
which
protects
your
employment
rights
or
protects
your
salary,
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
they
can't
represent
you
in
any
effectual
meaning.
but
the
national
labor
relations
act
sets
forth
its
policy
very
clearly
and
it
says
that
all
employees
in
interstate
commerce
should
be
allowed
to
be
and
must
be
allowed
to
be
represented
by
labor
unions
and
must
be
allowed
the
privilege
of
collective-bargaining
through
unions
of
their
own
choosing.
furthermore,
the
policy
of
the
act,
as
expressed
in
section
83,
is
that
labor
unions
should
be
protected
against
discriminatory
discharges
because
of
union
activity.
now,
those
policies
of
the
act
which
are
federal
law
apply
whether
the
person,
the
employee
involved
is
a
communist
or
not.
the
act
doesn't
say
that
only
non-communist
can
bargain
to
labor
unions
and
only
non-communist
can
join
a
labor
union.
now,
its
true
that
in
section
9
(h),
the
congress
showed
that
they
didn't
want
communist
to
be
officers
of
unions,
but
they
never
went
so
far
as
to
provide
that
communist
can't
be
represented
by
union.
the
amicus
brief
and
i
should
make
this
point
of
the
national
association
of
manufactures
which
has
been
filed
in
this
case.
the
n.
a.
m.
filed
a
brief
on
the
laboratory
side
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union
filed
an
amicus
brief
on
our
side.
the
amicus
brief
to
the
n.
a.
m.
suggest
that
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
decision
below
and
the
national
labor
relations
act,
then,
it
says
--
i'll
resume
after
lunch.
unknown
speaker
here
it
says
the
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
doris
brin.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
that?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
johnson
before
you
sit
down.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
if
--
what
we
have
here
then
is
the
evidence
of
the
fact
that
(inaudible)
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
there's
no
evidence
and
any
action
on
her
part
of
violence
or
sabotage
of
any
kind.
unknown
speaker
that
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
the
finding
that
has
been
made,
turning
her
to
the
--
one
of
the
company,
would
not
be
carried
out
because
it's
against
public
policy
in
california
to
employ
a
communist
in
a
plant
such
as
this.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
i
--
i
assume
that
she
was
a
communist.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
--
unknown
speaker
well,
that
--
that
made
her
active
communist.
unknown
speaker
now
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
that
if
you're
an
active
communist,
no
evidence
of
any
sabotage
or
act
of
communist
with
all
the
implications
of
the
past
that
that
was
not
--
she's
not
employable
after
a
contract
of
employment.
is
that
your
point?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
