mr.
gardiner
johnson
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
the
presentation
of
the
case
for
the
respondent,
i
shall
devote
my
portion
of
the
time
of
the
subject
to
the
order
of
the
court
in
discussing
primarily
the
factual
situation
and
my
colleague
mr.
stanton
will
discuss
some
of
the
legal
questions.
i
might
say
we
are
familiar
with
the
court's
attitude
on
divided
argument
and
i
hope
that
i
consider
the
court
that
i
am
prepared
to
discuss
any
legal
questions
that
might
arise,
but
a
unique
situation
has
been
presented
here,
we
think,
has
disclosed
by
petitioners
argument.
because
as
they
have
pointed
out
with
differences
here
between
the
parties
are
primarily,
i'm
careful
to
say
primarily,
differences
as
to
the
facts
and
the
findings
rather
than
as
to
the
law.
i
want
to
be
clear.
we
do
not
agree
with
many
of
the
statements
that
we
believe
to
be
enthusiastic
statements
by
counsel
on
what
the
decisions
have
held,
but
we
do
not
differ
in
the
name
with
the
legal
principles
that
he
has
stated.
we
simply
say
that
he
is
talking
about
another
case
and
not
the
one
that
was
tried
on
the
arbitration
proceedings
in
the
sir
francis
drake
hotel
in
san
francisco,
not
the
one
that
the
arbitrators
decided,
not
the
case
of
the
california
supreme
court
has
decided.
but
again,
i
would
be
clear,
our
position
is
not
that
he
argues
the
facts
to
the
contrary.
as
we
view
the
record,
they
walk
around
them.
they
don't
dispute
the
facts
that
supported
the
arbitrators
award.
they
don't
even
mentioned
them.
they
blatantly
ignore
them
and
then
having
done
so,
they
say
they
don't
exist.
rather
than
arguing
myself,
i
would
turn
to
their
brief
and
demonstrate
what
i
mean
by
a
couple
of
references
and
i
hope
where
he
pointed
once.
for
instance
in
the
beginning,
at
page
6
of
--
of
their
brief,
they
discuss
this
question
of
the
facts
and
here
is
what
they
say.
this
is
the
--
the
green
brief.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
we
assume
that
this
court,
likewise,
will
not
review
the
merits
of
the
factual
findings
of
the
arbitrators
or
have
they
stop
there,
we
would
agree.
but
in
the
same
breath,
having
said
they
are
not
going
to
argue
the
factual
findings,
they
go
on
with
this
astonishing
statement.
however,
the
majority
of
the
court
below
in
vacating
the
arbitrator's
award,
apparently
treated
certain
language.
i
emphasis
that.
certain
language
of
the
arbitrators
as
a
finding
that
the
discharged
employee
was
personally
dedicated
to
sabotage
force,
violence,
and
the
like.
a
conclusion
which
distorts
the
actual
holding
of
the
arbitrators
and
which
is
entirely
without
evidentiary
support.
now
may
i
point
out
that
they
choose
from
that
point
on
to
call
the
finding
which
was
read
and
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked,
“what
are
you
quoting
from?”
they
choose
from
this
point
on
to
call
it
not
a
finding
but
in
their
language
certain
evidence.
i
submit
to
the
court
and
--
and
welcome
a
careful
checking
of
the
record
that
if
that
portion
was
read,
if
that
is
not
a
finding,
then,
there
are
no
findings
in
this
case
either
by
the
arbitration
board
or
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
it
was
clearly
a
finding
that
because
counsel
to
--
to
argue
the
legal
points
that
they
make
here
must
build
a
false
structure.
they
don't
call
it
a
finding,
they
call
it
a
certain
language.
they
do
so
again
on
page
26
and
page
27.
basically
the
same
point,
it's
right
under
subsection
(h),
and
i
think
it's
worth
quoting
because
it
points
out
better
than
my
argument
can
and
this
is
what
their
position
is.
this
is
it.
we
pointed
out
above
that
the
findings
of
the
arbitrators,
they
call
them
findings
there
and
the
evidence
in
the
record
strongly
negate
any
notion
that
the
arbitrators
regarded
mrs.
walker
as
in
any
case
a
sabotage
risk.
now
let
me
stop
there
and
say,
as
you
will
note
carefully
that
they
call
it
findings
and
they
call
it
evidence
in
the
record
when
they
say
that
it
negates
any
finding
that
she
was
committed
to
sabotage.
but
if
you
will
please
follow
me,
they
then
go
on
in
the
next
sentence
and
say,
indeed,
the
very
award
itself
ordering
her
reinstatement
to
her
previous
job
is
the
best
evidence
of
the
lack
of
any
such
belief
from
the
arbitrators'
part,
and
then
the
astounding
thing
is,
they
proceed
immediately
to
quote
it
and
it
says
exactly
what
they
said
it
doesn't
say.
because
they
go
on
and
say
and
now
they
are
on
our
side
so
they
come
back
to
certain
language
instead
of
findings.
they
say,
however,
certain
language
used
in
the
arbitration
decision
is
erroneously
treated
by
the
company
and
apparently
by
the
court
below
as
a
finding
the
mrs.
walker
was
personally
dedicated
to
sabotage
force,
violence,
and
the
like.
and
because
it
is
vital,
may
i
reread
it
and
point
out
that
i
am
not
reading
from
the
minority
arbitrators
award
as
filed
by
mr.
(inaudible)
who
dissented,
“i
am
not
arguing
anything
based
on
his
finding
because
i
take
it
i
am
completely
precluded
from
that,
although,
they
don't
grant
the
same
respect
to
the
california
supreme
court.
i
am
taking
the
minority
award
and
here
is
specifically
what
they
said
as
it
is
set
forth
in
the
award
which
is
found
in
the
front
of
the
transcript
at
page
29
and
i'm
going
to
read
it
from
the
transcript
rather
from
the
brief.
beginning
at
the
top
of
the
page.
and
now,
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
having
stated
certain
preliminary
introductory
subjects,
the
arbitrators
are
now
in
subjects
numbered
first,
second
and
so
on,
and
obviously,
these
are
the
findings
and
this
is
the
statement.
the
company
maintains
that
the
basis
for
the
discharge
was
two-fold
as
goes
to
mr.
justice
reed's
question,
two
fold,
the
emissions
and
falsification
on
the
application
for
employment
and
membership
on
the
communist
party
with
the
full
implications
of
dedication
to
sabotage
force
violence
and
the
like
which
party
membership
is
believe
to
entail.
and
here
is
the
conclusion.
the
finding
that
the
company
honestly
believe
all
of
these
things
as
admitted
and
the
accuracy
of
those
beliefs
as
established
in
the
record
as
follows
by
admission
with
respect
to
the
emissions
and
falsifications
on
the
application
for
employment
by
undenied
and
uncontradicted
evidence
with
respect
to
the
membership
and
the
party
--
communist
party
and
by
uncontradicted
evidence,
that
the
company's
beliefs
about
the
full
implications
of
party
membership
were
prevalently
understood
and
is
shared.
in
this
view
of
the
record
and
we
take
this
view,
we
are
unable
to
find
that
the
company
has
been
denied
a
fair
hearing
by
reason
of
our
refusal
to
instruct
doris
walker
to
answer
questions
put
to
her
touching
this
issue.
they
seem
to
assume
that
that
is
to
be
shrug
off
and
disregarded.
they
call
it
not
a
finding
but
certain
language.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
i
say
that
there
were,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
i
have
that
coming
very
carefully
worked
out
here
because
that
has
not
been
developed
at
all.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
not
in
the
award
of
the
arbitrators,
your
honor.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
it
is
my
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
it
is
my
--
it
is
my
implication
from
that
finding
as
it
is
stated
in
its
entirety
that
the
arbitration
board
found
expressly
that
she
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
in
addition
that
she
was
committed
to
its
full
program
of
sabotage
violence
force
and
the
like,
that
is
correct.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
is
right
and
may
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
indeed
it
was.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
we
took
the
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
black,
that
this
finding
is
not
stated
the
way
i
withdraw
it
if
i'd
been
on
the
arbitration
board
but
i
don't
always
have
my
way
and
--
and
i
say
that
that
is
a
finding
directly
on
the
subject,
but
in
answer
to
your
question
and
i
don't
want
to
equivocate,
that
is
the
finding
and
that
is
the
finding
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
interpret
it.
now
the
board
did
comment
that
in
our
presentation
both
at
the
beginning
all
through
the
hearings
which
lasted
a
number
of
days
in
the
final
argument
that
we
contended
and
they
stated
this
in
the
introduction
that
the
company
contented
that
doris
walker
was
not
only
a
card
carrying
communist
which
we
prove
but
that
she
was
committed
to
the
full
program
that
she
was
a
traitor
and
an
enemy
of
our
nation
and
the
board
found
that
to
be
true
at
least
by
implication
but
it
--
it
did
not
so
state.
it
does
comment
upon
that
position
in
passing.
now
if
i
might
proceed
to
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
i
certainly
am,
your
honor,
with
great
detail
i
hope.
the
position
of
--
of
the
petitioner
as
we
understand
it
is
that
--
that
they
simply
take
the
broad
position
that
there
is
no
finding,
that
there
is
no
evidence
and
that
they
have
to
use
that
as
a
platform
or
a
springboard
from
which
to
take
their
legal
position
and
that
if
that
position
factually
and
as
far
as
the
findings
fail
then
their
whole
legal
position
is
out.
and
--
and
that's
why
i
wanted
to
devote
myself
with
more
than
usual
care
to
the
findings
in
this
matter.
i
would
come
first
to
the
question
that
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
this
young
lady's
personal
record.
this
was
no
dupe.
this
was
no
person
who
went
along
and
join
the
party
figuring
if
it
was
the
way
to
get
advancement
on
employment.
the
record
shows
without
any
possible
question
something
that
i
think
has
seldom
improved
american
trials
involving
communist.
i
am
aware
that
in
the
dennis
case,
mr.
justice
jackson
commented
about
the
communist
party
as
follows.
he
said
from
established
policy,
it
tolerates
no
deviation
and
no
debate.
may
i
call
the
court's
attention
believing
that
a
picture
will
present
this
far
better
than
my
words
to
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
unfortunately,
in
the
printing
of
the
record,
one
of
the
documents
which
have
been
introduced
in
photo
list
style
was
simply
printed
twice.
what
we
have
done
to
aid
the
arbitrators
was
to
put
in
a
handwritten
document
which
is
this
three-page
letter
in
the
appendix.
and
then
to
aid
them,
we
had
given
them
a
typewritten
copy
of
it
and
in
the
printing
of
the
record,
they
both
come
out
printed.
so,
we
had
it
photostat
or
photo
list
in
our
brief.
now,
i
--
i
have
no
intention
of
trying
to
turn
this
court
into
a
jury
trial
but
i
know
of
no
rule
which
forbids
an
appellate
court
from
using
the
ordinary
senses
of
perception.
and
i
call
your
attention
first
to
the
signature
on
the
three-page
document.
i
call
attention
then
to
the
signature
on
the
cutter
laboratories'
application,
which
is
on
the
reverse
page
on
the
top
line.
and
to
further
illustrate
it,
there
are
--
there
is
another
application
which
we
eventually
got
from
a
cannery
which
is
immediately
behind
the
three-page
letter.
this
is
part
of
the
record
because
we
think
it's
significant.
i
intend
to
read
it
until
though
it's
very
short.
i'm
reading
it
from
page
72
and
may
i
state
to
the
court
so
no
one
has
any
misunderstanding
that
in
our
contention
and
we
believe
the
record
proves
this
that
this
is
a
confession
in
this
lady's
handwriting
to
the
top
hierarchy
of
the
communist
party
in
alameda
county
and
in
the
state
of
california,
that
she
had
gotten
off
as
they
term
it
to
the
party
line
and
deserve
to
be
disciplined.
she
refuses
even
to
acknowledge
her
signature,
although,
i
think
no
handwriting
expert
is
needed
to
note
the
similarity
to
the
other
documents
but
here
is
what
it
says,
it
stated
july
10
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
sir.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
it
is
a
handwritten
letter
in
the
petitioners
--
in
doris
brandon
walker's
handwriting
addressed
to
top
functionaries
of
the
communist
party
in
alameda
county,
california
in
which
she
is
reciting
certain
conduct
of
hers
at
party
meetings
in
which
she
got
off
the
party
line
was
irresponsible
as
she
puts
it
and
needs
to
be
disciplined
by
them
and
apparently,
they
require
her
having
confessed
to
the
county
people,
they
required
her
to
transmit
it
in
writing
to
the
state
party
leaders.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
it
was
their
company's
exhibit
number
6,
of
course,
as
it's
usual
in
such
cases,
she
refused
to
answer
any
question
concerning
it.
but
here's
what
it
said.
now,
this
goes
directly
to
their
question
of
whether
there's
evidence.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
it's
doris
brin.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
walker
is
one
of
her
married
names.
the
records
shows
in
a
number
of
places
that
her
maiden
name
was
doris
brin
which
evidently
was
her
communist
party
name.
she
had
been
married
to
a
mr.
marasi,
divorced
from
him
and
married
to
mr.
walker.
that
information
that
i
have
just
given
you
is
all
set
out
on
exhibits
22
and
23
which
are
printed
on
pages
70
and
71
of
the
transcript.
the
document
says
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i'm
reading
now
from
page
72
of
the
transcript,
your
honor
and
it
is
the
--
the
typewritten
subject
matter
of
this
letter.
dated
july
10,
1946,
i
made
the
following
statement
to
lloyd
today
and
at
my
request
that
he
transmit
it
to
the
state,
he
suggested
i
write
it
out.
after
my
discussions
with
lloyd
and
carol,
monday
morning
july
8,
i
gave
a
lot
of
thought
to
the
points
they
raise
concerning
the
resolution
on
the
maritime
strike
introduced
into
the
cannery
workers
club
which
is
identified
as
a
communist
party
sell
among
the
cannery
workers
by
elsie
smith
in
may.
now,
this
is
the
significant
part,
i
think.
i
tried
to
evaluate
my
action
as
i
try
to
evaluate
whatever
i
do
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
welfare
of
the
working
class
on
the
strengthening
of
the
party,
with
a
capital
p.
what
had
struck
me
particularly
in
the
discussion
where
charles
points
as
to
the
limited
nature
of
our
information,
the
daily
papers
including
the
pw,
which
is
identified
as
the
people's
world,
the
official
communist
party
paper
in
san
francisco
and
the
irresponsibility
implied
by
introducing
a
resolution
based
on
such
limited
information.
i
feel
that
had
i
not
been
so
much
on
the
defensive
during
the
discussion,
i
would
have
admitted
my
error
at
that
time.
as
it
was,
i
spent
two
days
and
much
of
two
nights
thinking
through
what
i
had
done
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
have
introduced
such
a
resolution
under
my
club
did
not
meet
my
test
and
was
wrong.
as
a
member
of
a
club
remote
from
the
maritime
situation
and
with
no
special
information
to
have
introduced
the
resolution
was
irresponsible.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i
had
reached
this
position
independently
and
before
i
talked
to
elsie
smith
yesterday,
after
i
told
her
how
my
thinking
was
going,
she
told
me
that
she
agreed
in
substance
and
had
already
told
the
county
so,
which
means
the
alameda
county
authority
signed
doris
brin.
now
in
the
record,
lloyd
and
carol
are
definitely
identified
as
lloyd
laymon
and
carol
barnes
both
top
communist
party
functionaries
in
alameda
county.
they
are
the
people
with
whom
she
has
discussed
this
meeting
or
this
letter
it
she
says
on
the
morning
--
the
morning
of
july
the
8th.
the
person
who
wrote
that
letter
has
a
remarkable
educational
background.
one
question
has
been
asked
to
her.
none
of
these
has
come
forth
in
the
argument
of
the
petitioners,
but
may
i
just
review
this
woman's
--
this
young
lady's
educational
record.
in
doing
so,
i
want
to
confess
that
somewhere
in
this
record,
there
is
an
american
tragedy.
it's
not
for
me
to
decide
and
i
think
that
this
court
can't,
but
here
is
a
girl
who
graduated
from
ucla
in
1939
with
honors
in
english,
a
member
of
phi
beta
kappa.
she
went
to
the
university
of
california
berkley,
the
law
school
which
i
insert
another
people
prominent
in
washington
attended.
she
was
not
only
graduated
with
an
llb
in
1942
but
she
was
a
member
of
the
editorial
board
of
the
california
law
review.
and
yet
she
graduated,
as
the
record
shows
in
may
1942
and
by
june
the
3rd,
she
did
two
significant
things
on
the
same
day.
she
joined
the
communist
party,
became
a
card
carrying
member
and
she
went
to
work
for
the
opa
in
san
francisco
as
an
enforcement
attorney
where
she
stayed
for
some
two
years
beginning
on
the
salary
of
$1800
as
the
record
shows
and
going
up
to
$3200.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
this
young
lady
had
practiced
law
in
san
francisco
before
she
came
to
cutter
laboratories
and
the
record
shows
that,
and
she
doesn't
deny
it.
she
admitted
it.
she
had
practiced
law
with
the
firm
of
gladstein,
grossman,
sawyer,
and
margolis
prior
to
her
cutter
employment
for
less
than
a
year.
then
she
had
gone
to
the
canneries
where
there
was
labor
strike
between
the
teamsters
and
the
food
tobacco
and
agricultural
workers.
first
she
end
up
on
the
picket
line
representing
herself
as
being
a
union
representative
and
finding
apparently
that
she
was
ineffective
there,
she
actually
got
into
the
plants
and
stood
in
the
line
cutting
asparagus
and
cutting
spinach,
a
member
of
the
state
bar
of
california,
because
i
omitted
that.
she
was
admitted
to
the
state
bar
of
california
on
december
the
8th
of
1942.
she
is
practicing
law
now
in
san
francisco.
upon
the
handing
down
of
this
award
as
her
attorney
predicted
at
the
trial
upon
exposure,
it
was
economic
debt
as
far
as
the
type
of
work
that
she
had
gotten
into
so,
she's
back
practicing
law
in
san
francisco.
and
i
might
say
practicing
rather
actively.
this
is
the
personal
history
as
demonstrated
in
this
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no,
that
is
not,
of
course.
but
i
might
say
that
the
--
the
misrepresentations
that
she
made
to
our
client
in
filing
out
the
application
blank
are
certainly
direct
violations
of
the
state
bar
act
of
california.
because
as
it's
demonstrated
in
the
record,
the
--
the
second
document
which
i
called
your
attention
to,
this
application
of
the
cutter
laboratories
is
a
complete
fabrication.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
it
does
not,
no.
no,
sir.
that
the
way
we
found
that
out
was
on
the
first
investigation
in
1947
but
we
couldn't
run
down.
the
company
was
unable
to
run
down
these
references
that
she
gave.
one
of
them
is
a
lawyer.
mr.
mcturnan
who
is
referred
to
in
that
document
as
a
lawyer.
she
admitted
under
oath
that
she
called
him
and
told
him
that
she
had
given
him
as
a
reference
as
she
did
the
other
reference
and
that
she
had
asked
him
not
to
disclose
her
legal
background
or
training.
he
knew
it
because
it
was
his
brother
john
trippe
mcturnan
under
whom
she
had
worked
at
the
opa
and
it
is
john
trippe
mcturnan
whose
name
--
she
has
cut
the
family
name
off
in
her
application
and
she
list
john
trippe
as
her
former
employer
in
checking
the
state
bar
records.
eventually
it
was
rundown
by
checking
the
mcturnans.
we
stumbled
on
to
the
fact
that
there
were
two,
and
one
was
francis
and
one
was
john
trippe.
and
at
the
hearing,
she
admitted
that's
what
she
did.
now
i'm
not
arguing
her
state
bar
violation
here.
i
take
it
that
will
be
handled
in
due
course
by
other
authority.
that's
not
part
of
my
case.
but
i
did
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i
think
without
any
question,
her
action
in
misrepresenting
completely
her
record
is
a
direct
and
unquestioned
violation
of
the
state
bar
act
of
any
of
the
states,
but
you
are
quite
right.
the
conduct
that
i
referred
to
practicing
law
now
does
not
violate
our
state
law
unless
she
is
still
carrying
on
the
conspiracy
that
we
think
that
she
was
proved
--
proved
to
have
been
carrying
on
during
her
employment
and
our
plan
and
if
she's
doing
that,
i
think
she
is
violating
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
law
of
california
expressly
so
states.
now,
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
type
of
person
who
sought
employment
in
three
canneries
and
then
came
to
cutter
laboratories
and
became
first
as
has
been
said
a
label
clerk
and
then
took
on
some
minor
curricular
activity.
we
asked
during
the
hearing
a
number
of
questions
but
may
i
say
first
that
they
--
they
who
now
say
that
they've
had
no
trial,
the
parties
who
complained
that
--
that
this
is
taking
away
due
process
because
they
haven't
had
a
hearing,
they
tried
at
the
arbitration
board's
hearing
is
to
stop
us
before
we
ever
got
started.
we
had
asked
the
collateral
question
about
the
law
firm
that
she'd
been
working
for.
specifically
the
question
was,
“when
you
took
employment
there,
did
you
know
that
they
were
the
attorneys
for
the
communist
party?”
admittedly
a
collateral
question,
she
refused
to
answer.
the
record
shows
that
there
was
a
long
conference
about
it
and
that
eventually
a
ruling
was
made.
the
basic
ruling
strangely
was
made
on
that
issue.
and
that
the
arbitrators,
at
that
point,
indicated
that
they
were
not
going
to
compel
of
her
to
answer.
they
found
that
the
issue
of
communist
party
membership
and
activity
was
relevant,
that
it
was
part
of
the
issues
of
the
hearing,
that
they
said
we
are
not
going
to
compel
her
to
answer
because
if
we
do,
you,
meaning
to
employer,
will
go
to
court
and
have
recited
and
this
arbitration
will
bug
down.
so
we
were
compelled
to
proceed
without
any
compulsion.
what
happened
was
that
mr.
edises,
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner,
tried
to
get
us
to
accept
a
stipulation.
he
tried
to
get
us
to
stipulate
that
he
would
concede
everything
that
was
pertinent.
he
said
so
in
--
in
those
words.
we
decline
to
accept
that.
we
stated
that
the
good
faith
of
the
management
was
not
the
issue,
but
we
were
entitled
to
prove
the
communist
party
and
communist
activity
issue.
so
we
went
ahead.
eventually,
mr.
edises
stated
his
position
that
we
were
persecuting
the
young
lady.
now,
i
emphasize
this
because
their
complaint
here
is
that
they
have
not
had
a
trial.
to
the
contrary,
they
took
the
position
at
the
hearing
that
we
had
gone
further
than
we
were
required
to
or
entitled
to
that
we
have
proved
everything
that
was
at
issue.
and
eventually,
mr.
edises
stated
that
we
were
not
going
to
prove
mrs.
walker
to
be
a
communist
and
he
said
bluntly
because
i
am
not
going
to
allow
you
to.
i
would
like
to
read
that
from
the
record.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention,
page
139
and
140.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
mr.
edises
is
speaking
and
this
is
what
he
says,"they
are
not
going
to
prove
in
this
arbitration
proceeding
and
they
could
not
prove
whether
she
is
a
communist
or
not
because
i
am
not
going
to
permit
her
to
answer
that
question.
therefore,
all
they
could
do
would
be
to
bring
in
evidence
showing
that
they
had
some
basis
for
their
suspicions
for
their
beliefs
and
that
is
all
it
could
come
out
of
it.
you
could
not
even
make
a
finding
on
that
issue
in
this
posture
of
the
case.”
and
then
here's
his
offer.
“in
order
to
expedite
this
hearing
and
to
defend
what
is
a
principal
position
as
far
as
mrs.
walker
is
concerned,
we
are
willing
to
make
a
concession
of
everything
that
they
could
possibly
prove.
we
are
willing
to
make
a
concession
of
everything
that
they
could
possibly
prove.
and
anything
further,
i
submit,
goes
beyond
the
necessities
of
proof
and
actually
gets
on
to
species
of
persecution.
i
am
not
quoting
anyone
but
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
at
the
hearing.
we
persisted
to
the
arbitration
board
that
we
are
entitled
to
put
our
questions
and
to
proceed
to
prove
the
issue
and
eventually
we
did.
the
questions
which
are
--
were
not
asked
are
set
out
in
one
position,
they
are
accumulated
at
pages
49
to
69
of
the
--
of
the
transcript.
the
reason
being
that
we
collated
them
to
present
them
to
the
superior
court,
and
they
are
all
collected
together
at
those
pages.
they
appear
throughout
the
transcript.
they
appear,
for
instance,
at
page
163
to
173.
the
questions
concerning
exhibit
6,
the
party
line
confession
appear
at
pages
192
to
197.
none
of
them
answered.
even
though
laboriously,
we
went
through
the
document
and
asked
her
every
possible
question
concerning
each
individual
fact.
the
questions
concerning
exhibits
6,
22
and
23
appear
at
pages
423
to
444.
in
that
connection,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
exhibits
22
and
23,
as
they
appear
at
page
--
pages
70
and
71
set
forth
rather
detailed
items
listing
official
party
offices
that
she
had
held.
they
referred
to
individual
facts
concerning
her
party
record.
her
card
number
is
given
on
the
date
when
it
was
issued.
she
was
questioned
concerning
all
of
those
items
and
of
course
refused
to
answer
any
of
them.
now
we
contend
that
upon
that
record
and
i
want
--
i
want
to
refer
to
two
specific
questions.
at
pages
442
and
443
of
the
transcript,
she
was
asked
directly
these
questions,
and
this
appears
at
the
bottom
on
page
442.
mrs.
walker
is
testifying.
isn't
it
a
fact
that
the
reason
why
you
listed
those
individuals
and
contracted
this
fictitious
employer
was
because
of
the
fact
that
you
were
a
remember
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
and
that
you
desire
to
get
into
the
cutter
plant
in
order
to
carry
on
more
effectively
and
more
actively
the
program
and
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
of
course,
she
declined
to
answer.
on
the
next
page,
we
asked
her
specifically
this
question.
“isn't
it
a
fact
and
a
matter
of
fact,
mrs.
walker,
that
your
state
of
mind
at
that
time
was
that
you
were
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
that
you
were
interesting
--
interested
in
getting
out
into
the
field
and
taking
a
more
active
role
in
carrying
on
the
field
of
activities
in
which
you're
interested
and
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
and
that
it
was
for
that
reason
that
you
misrepresented
those
facts.
now,
the
record
demonstrates
beyond
any
question
a
very
interesting
position,
which
i
want
to
state
briefly
to
this
court.
this
young
lady
had
been
investigated
in
1947
as
the
record
shows
because
some
of
the
women
employees
in
the
plant
contended
that
what
they
denominated
as
communist
literature
was
being
brought
into
the
ladies
rest
room.
the
management
made
a
check.
eliminated
it
down
to
the
point
where
one
or
more
of
about
15
people
were
suspected.
and
then
what
they
did
never
having
had
this
problem
before,
they
asked
the
retail
credit
association
to
carry
on
an
investigation
of
each
one
of
them
just
as
they've
done
with
some
other
salesmen.
immediately,
the
report
on
this
young
lady
or
with
$6
or
$7
was
paid
came
back
positive.
but
the
testimony
shows
that
the
executive
vice
president
called
us
--
called
in
the
attorneys
and
said
here
is
the
report.
here
are
these
facts,
can
we
discharge
this
woman.
she
was
a
union
official
at
that
time.
now
i
cite
to
this
court
on
the
record,
i
think
will
support
maybe
on
any
question
and
mr.
cutter
made
the
statement
unequivocally
its
in
the
record,
that
he
was
advised
by
his
counsel
that
what
you
have
is
gossip,
suspicion,
name
calling.
it
may
lead
you
to
believe
that
she
is
a
communist,
but
it
is
not
evidence
and
no
arbitrator
will
sustain
it.
and
on
that
ground,
she
was
not
discharged
at
that
time,
but
they
checked
her.
incidentally,
they
went
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
on
june
the
18th,
1947,
the
same
day
they
serve
the
notice
to
open
the
agreement.
they
came
to
us
and
said,
“you
have
been
putting
these
people
under
surveillance
because
of
union
activities.”
the
company
said,
“no.”
surveillance,
yes”
admitted
but
not
for
union
activities,
for
definite,
communist
activities
which
are
suspected
on
the
basis
of
these
reports.
now,
the
charges
were
dismissed
although
we
asked
for
a
hearing
before
the
nlrb.
we
wanted
a
hearing,
but
the
charges
were
dismissed.
so
she
remained
in
the
plant.
until
1949,
one
of
the
personal
employees
read
in
the
labor
herald,
a
cio
paper
in
san
francisco,
a
statement
that
$205,000
in
back
salary
was
being
paid
to
some
cannery
workers.
and
the
concluding
paragraph
said
that
doris
walker,
her
discharge,
was
going
to
be
appealed
because
she
had
been
fired
for
refusing
to
testify
as
the
communist
party
membership.
immediately
upon
the
reading
of
that,
the
company
directed
us
and
we
had
investigators
on
that
occasion,
professional
investigators
come
in.
they
started
of
by
getting
the
record
from
mr.
(inaudible)
office.
he
had
been
the
attorney
in
the
cannery
dispute.
and
having
that
information,
the
record
shows
that
from
the
day
when
they
got
that
information
on
august
the
23rd
of
1949,
that
the
only
period
elapsing
was
between
august
the
23rd
and
october
the
5th.
when
we
went
over
to
the
plant
with
the
information
which
the
investigators
had
brought
in,
all
of
this
detailed
information
and
much
more
than
what
we're
able
to
get
into
the
hearing,
and
all
day
was
spent
going
over
that
report.
the
record
shows
this.
it
was
checked.
it
was
discussed.
the
conclusion
was
reached
and
they're
advised
that
this
is
not
suspicion.
this
is
proof.
and
the
next
day,
she
was
discharged.
now
they
say
--
and
they
seem
to
say
it
seriously
on
the
brief.
that
they
never
had
any
idea
or
suspicion
that
the
communist
issue
was
part
of
this
case
until
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california.
this
record
shows
beyond
any
contradiction.
but
in
the
very
statement
which
was
read
to
her,
on
october
the
6th
when
she
was
discharged
that
--
that
very
issue
was
covered.
she
was
told
in
the
statement
which
the
vice
president
of
the
company
read
to
her
as
follows.
we
are
convinced
now
that
for
a
number
of
years,
you
have
been
and
still
are
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
we
are
convinced
beyond
any
question
that
for
a
number
of
years
you
have
participated
actively
in
the
communist
party's
activities.
the
nature
of
our
company's
business
requires
more
than
the
usual
precaution
against
sabotage
and
subversion.
upon
a
disclosure
that
any
employee
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
or
has
participated
in
other
subversive
or
revolutionary
activity.
we
conceive
it
to
be
the
responsibility
of
management
to
take
action.
confronted
with
such
a
situation,
any
inclination
to
be
lenient
or
to
grant
a
union
official
special
consideration
which
is
what
the
company
contented
it
had
done
in
1947
is
out.
in
the
face
of
your
record,
there
is
no
alternative
open
to
us
except
to
terminate
your
services
at
once.
accordingly,
you
are
notified
that
you
are
discharge
for
the
cause
as
mentioned.
you
will
be
paid
the
full
amount
duty
properly.
now
may
i
carefully
state
that
--
i
mean
that's
at
page
8
of
the
arbitrator's
report,
your
honor.
at
pages
7,
8,
9
and
10
appear
the
statement
which
the
company
read
to
her
on
her
dismissal.
it
is
set
out
in
full
in
the
arbitrators
--
in
the
transcript.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
at
pages
7,
8,
9
and
10.
it
is
also
set
out
in
full
in
the
supreme
court
of
california's
report
in
the
--
in
the
back
portion
of
the
transcript.
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no,
sir.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no
sir.
that
was
apparent
--
that
was
conceded
by
all
parties.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
mr.
cutter
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
mr.
cutter
did
say
this.
may
i
answer
your
question
this
way
because,
possibly,
i
haven't
understood
the
full
import
of
it.
mr.
cutter
testified
the
considerable
extent
as
to
the
fact
that
their
products
were
peculiarly
subject
to
sabotage.
now
may
i
clear
that
up.
he's
not
talking
about
dropping
this.
he
may,
of
course,
not
talking
about
dropping
emery
dust
into
the
machinery.
he
says
that's
a
routine
and
can
be
cleared
up
very
quickly.
he's
talking
about
the
destruction
of
the
records,
the
destruction
of
tests.
things
that
you
are
not
able
to
find
quickly
and
he
does
point
out
extensively
at
a
number
of
pages
that's
covered
on
page
326
to
330.
it's
covered
on
pages
401
and
402.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
certainly
in
this
case
it
is
not
necessary.
i
--
i
think
our
view
is
that
in
this
case
we
demonstrated
far
beyond
what
it's
possible
to
do
normally,
that
there
were
such
proclivities.
we
demonstrated
that
this
young
lady
was
not
just
a
dupe.
we
just
demonstrated
that
she
had
gotten
into
the
plant
for
the
purpose
of,
as
we
see
it,
and
the
supreme
court
so
found
in
california
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
becoming
where
she
eventually
went
up
as
the
president
of
the
union.
and
we
think
that
--
that
some
of
your
past
decisions
from
this
court
have
indicated
that
those
are
positions
where
employers
must
be
very
cautious.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no
i
don't
think
i
said
that.
i
did
not
intend
to.
what
i
--
what
i
did
say
in
the
record
is
abundantly
clear
on
it
that
mr.
edises,
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner,
in
an
effort
to
block
us
off,
this
record
demonstrates
that
when
that
first
question
was
asked,
they
asked
for
a
five-minute
recess
and
they
went
out
on
the
hall
and
there
was
big
huddle
about
what
to
do.
and
when
they
came
back
before
we
could
post
any
question,
he
offered
the
stipulation.
he
wanted
to
chop
us
off
from
even
having
the
right
to
answer
a
question
or
ask
a
question.
and
what
he
said
was,
that
he
would
stipulate
to
all
of
the
proofs
that
we
needed.
that
we
didn't
have
to
go
any
further
that
if
we
did
it
was
persecution.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
we
had
charged
in
our
opening
statement
in
the
statement
of
discharge.
we
had
charge
that
she
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
with
all
of
the
--
as
the
arbitrator
said
with
the
full
implications
of
commitment
to
sabotage
force
and
violence.
now
there
are
--
there
are
a
couple
of
important
points
that
i
want
to
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no,
sir.
she
did
not.
i
think
that's
not
unusual
on
the
situation
but
i
want
to
answer
your
--
answer
your
question
directly,
she
did
not.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
want
to
ask
--
answer
your
question
very
directly
and
i'm
not
going
to
fudge.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
i
have
these
reports
here.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
material
in
the
second
report.
a
great
deal
of
material.
some
of
it
we
did
not
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
this
is
the
report
that
our
investigators
brought
in.
some
of
these
questions
were
asked
somewhere
or
not.
we
got
to
the
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no,
sir.
now
there
had
been,
there
had
been
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
only
thing
which
is
in
the
record,
your
honor,
and
it
is
not
complete,
there
is
a
reference
in
the
record
to
a
prior
arbitration.
they
had
a
strike
in
19
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
page
on
the
1947
strike.
i'll
get
it
for
you.
they
had
--
they
had
a
strike
in
1947.
on
that
occasion,
there
was
an
arbitration
because
a
couple
of
employees
with
mrs.
walker
got
in
through
the
gate.
she
was
stopped
before
she
got
in
so
she
never
got
there
but
the
other
two
men
went
in
and
turned
off
the
penicillin
machines.
now
we
contented
as
to
them
and
the
prior
arbitration
that,
that
was
a
deliberate
act
of
sabotage.
i
might
say
we
lost
the
arbitration
because
the
arbitrator
held
that
when
the
company
settled
with
the
union.
in
effect,
they
settled
with
the
man
who
had
been
dupes
as
they
i
call
them
and
therefore
that
we
had
condoned
it,
but
there
was
evidence
as
referred
to
in
--
a
47
strike
is
referred
to
on
page
13
in
the
arbitrator's
report.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
page
13.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes.
all
the
pages
that
i
am
giving
to
the
arbitrator's
report
are
transcript
pagea.
there
is
also
a
reference
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
beginning
in
the
upper
paragraph
it
says,
negotiations
culminated
in
the
strike
which
lasted
from
august
10
to
17
1947,
with
the
intervention
of
harry
bridges,
the
strike
was
settled
on
august
18,
1947
as
a
result
of
negotiation
with
him.
that
is
the
extent
of
the
reference
there.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
that
is
correct.
the
1947
strike,
let
me
be
clear
on
that,
was
for
wages.
it
was
not
a
strike
but
the
incident
that
i'm
referring
to,
the
individual
incident
that
i'm
referring
to
which
occurred
during
the
strike
is
definitely
not
for
wages
but
was
simply
a
deliberate
holding
through
the
gate.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
reference
--
the
only
reference
to
that,
your
honor,
is
on
page
85
of
our
brief.
now
that
was
not
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no
that
was
not
put
in
the
record.
let
me
be
clear
on
that.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
evidence
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
evidence
in
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
evidence
in
the
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
well,
the
evidence
in
the
record
consist
of
the
questions
for
instance
that
i
referred
to
on
page
442
and
443
and
which
we
endeavored
to
get
into
that
subject,
you
will
note
the
two
questions
that
i
read,
the
one
at
the
bottom
of
442,
the
other
question
at
the
bottom
of
443.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no,
sir
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
no,
sir.
she
would
not
answer
anything.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
well
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
board
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
board
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
board
took
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
board
took
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
board
took
this
position,
your
honor.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
there
are
no
answers.
no,
sir.
but
if
i
might
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
if
i
might
state
my
explanation
now.
the
board
took
the
position
as
i
indicated
that
they
would
not
require
her
to
answer,
but
they
stated
to
her
at
the
outset,
that
if
you
do
not
answer,
we
will
draw
any
reasonable
inferences.
and
they
continued
to
tell
her
that
as
we
went
along
at
various
junctures.
we
would
ask
her
again
and
at
the
end
we
ask
for
an
instruction
that
she
be
compelled
to
answer
these
questions.
and
the
board
put
her
unnoticed
and
stated
to
her,
“if
you
refuse
to
answer,
we
will
not
compel
you,
we
will
not
allow
counsel
to
have
you
cited,
but
we
will
draw
any
reasonable
inferences.”
and
as
the
board
indicates,
we
think,
in
their
award
in
the
part
that
i
read,
set
out
on
the
top
of
page
29,
they
drew
the
reasonable
inferences
from
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
from
the
documentary
evidence
that
had
been
introduced
and
her
failure
to
answer.
now
the
supreme
court
of
california
i
want
to
answer
your
question
so
this
is
very
clear.
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
its
decision
at
page
476,
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
says,
the
evidence
as
to
her
communist
membership
and
acceptance
of
party
principles
with
all
the
implications
that
flow
there
from
thus
stands
unchallenged
and
uncontradicted
by
her
and
clearly
supports
the
board's
finding
not
the
supreme
court
finding
but
clearly
supports
the
board's
finding
that
the
company
honestly
and
correctly
believed
her
to
be
annoying
and
deliberately
acting
communist.
now,
i
think
that's
the
first
statement
of
the
facts.
for
the
remaining
time
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
have
mr.
stanton
discuss
one
or
two
of
the
legal
points.
i
hope
i
have
made
clear
that
--
that
we
believe
that
the
facts
as
we
have
stated
them
as
the
record
in
uncontradicted
fashion
develops
them
as
the
board
find
them
and
as
the
california
supreme
court
reaffirmed
the
board's
finding
make
the
legal
arguments
as
made
by
petitioner
completely
irrelevant
but
mr.
stanton
will
develop
--
mr.
gardiner
johnson
yes,
sir.
mr.
gardiner
johnson
the
california
supreme
court's
findings
or
the
declaration
of
the
finding
is
set
out
on
page
476.
