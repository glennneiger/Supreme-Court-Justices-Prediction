what
is
quoted
from
what?
the
quotation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
does
it
come
from,
mr.
forer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
was
the
latter
--
it
was
the
latter
ground
on
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
went
for
the
moment
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
breaking
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
they
were
justified
in
going
on
that
ground
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
the
professed
ground
of
the
california
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
--
you
can't
tell
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
there's
a
conflict
between
you
and
the
respondent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
what
it
is
that
the
california
court
really
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
assume
that
they've
decided
--
but
you
also
going
to
tell
us,
what
your
view
is,
assume
they
decided
or
it
could
fairly
be
construed
if
decided
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
respondent
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
that
is
--
if
that
was
the
view
--
you
still
reject
that
as
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
from
your
point
of
you,
it
doesn't
matter
what
they
decide
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case,
i
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
communist,
you
mean
member
of
the
communist
party
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
through
a
sense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i'm
not
drawing
any
implication
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
the
latter
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
lady
a
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
question
that
was
put
to
her,
was
there
a
question
or
was
there
a
question
that
sought
to
elicit
what
in
fact
her
activities
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
desires
to
be
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
point
and
tell
us
what
it
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
need
to
identify
the
content
of
this
document
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down.
as
i
understand
your
position
to
mr.
(inaudible)
today,
namely,
you're
not
arguing
for
the
general
proposition
that
no
communist
and
no
member
of
the
communist
party
should
be
employed
in
california.
your
position
is
that
this
particular
situation
--
particular
set
of
facts,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
light
of
that,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
quick
question.
i
recall
that
your
supreme
court,
whatever
it
was,
(inaudible)
held
unconstitutional
a
provision
of
your
electoral
law
denying
the
right
of
a
communist
party
as
such
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
contract
--
i
have
that
run
down
and
i
find
that
that
provision
of
the
electoral
law
has
been
formally
--
was
formally
repealed
by
your
legislation.
it
does
not
count
on
the
book.
and
i
recall
the
decision
of
your
court,
it's
partly
based
on
the
fact
that
the
court
could
not
take
judicial
notice
in
its
decision
at
that
time
as
i
have
(inaudible)
communist
party
impliedly
is
a
party
dedicated
to
force
and
violence,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
relation,
what's
the
bearing
of
that
decision
in
this
case
as
you
see
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
i
don't
(inaudible)
opinion.
in
other
words,
either
you
say
explicitly
(inaudible)
change
our
mind
and
now
we
take
judicial
notice
to
a
party
as
such
and
everything
that
the
course
apply
etcetera?
