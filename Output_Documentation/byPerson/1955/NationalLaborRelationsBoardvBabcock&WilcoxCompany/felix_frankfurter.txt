justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
instance,
you
take
the
difference
between
employees
and
non-employees
in
showing
the
proposed
propaganda.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
are
there
members,
are
the
employee,
members
of
the
union,
are
there
employees
of
the
employer
in
the
same
status
in
all
three
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
members
of
the
--
if
the
employer
have
a
given
(inaudible)
members
of
the
union
that
to
me
is
a
differentiating
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
but
it's
not
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
may
become
important
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
a
real
--
real
difference
of
opinion
on
that.
it's
within
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
situation
here
and
also
whether
the
--
whether
they
are
employees,
whether
the
employees
are
the
members
of
the
union
that.
there
are
differences.
as
i
understand
the
board
that
some
of
these
--
it's
not
location.
the
board
has
taken
a
distinction
between
employees
who
sought
the
propaganda
when
there
are
other
employees
in
the
union
for
which
the
effort
is
made.
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
--
how
about
the
people
who
speak
to
make
contracting
themselves
employees
against
not
employed.
is
that
a
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
opposite
that
is
applicable
to
(inaudible)
the
facts
of
the
letourneau
case,
i'm
not
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
may
become
important
unless
you
get
a
rigid
rule
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
also
what
other
facilities
there
are
on
its
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
have
to
say
then
all
of
these
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
merely
suggest
that
the
applicable
are
the
--
at
least
there
are
three
cases
and
the
court
(inaudible)
has
ordered
not
to
desire
to
hear
the
same
cases
together
that
would
anticipate.
ultimately,
there's
a
question
of
balancing
consideration.
it's
pretty
important
to
have
the
exact
considerations
for
the
present
(inaudible)
discriminating
the
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
--
i'll
leave
that
to
your
judgment.
if
you
are
urging
(inaudible)
but
there
rigid
groups
and,
of
course,
i
can't
get
through
if
you
will.
that's
one
thing.
but
if
it
mean
a
balancing
of
consideration,
then
the
consideration
must
be
admitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
i
can
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
difference,
that
the
--
the
employee
himself
will
be
questionable
when
he's
talking
with
his
fellow
employees
that
there's
something
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
employee
of
the
plant,
it's
very
difficult
to
say
you
can't
talk
to
your
fellow
employees
on
the
parking
lot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
isn't
that
what
--
wouldn't
it
practically
get
down
to
the
fact
that
i'm
--
i'm
restricted
of
my
freedom
to
talk
to
you
as
a
fellow
employee
and
to
take
your
time
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
when
you
said
effective
exercise
of
their
rights,
is
that
--
if
--
if
i
have
to
live
with
that
statement,
then
i've
already
answered
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that
the
question
is
whether
they
have
right
to
receive
it,
if
that's
fine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
you
can
say
it
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
restriction
upon
the
employee,
if
--
if
i
can
talk
to
you
or
give
a
piece
of
literature
to
my
fellow
employees
the
way
i
could
talk
to
them,
give
them
the
literature
to
my
colleagues
on
this
court.
it's
a
relationship
statistics.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
looking
merely
at
the
employer
(inaudible)
property,
naked
piece
of
property.
i
don't
see
what
the
word
"naked"
while
that
the
insertion
of
that
word
"naked"
is
sort
of
prejudicial
to
the
whole
case
why,
that
is
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
the
--
the
inconvenience
to
the
employer.
i'm
not
saying
the
burden
is
on
the
employee,
in
that
case,
to
be
forbidden
to
talk
(inaudible)
fellow
employees.
that
was
the
essence,
that
was
of
the
core
of
those
cases
you
got
by.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
at
--
at
a
particular
place
have
the
abstract
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that,
we
can't
answer
the
question
by
assuming
the
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
but
just
as
the
rules
have
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
difference
as
it
discussed
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
employee
and
non-employee
as
to
this,
in
essence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
it
was,
give
me
the
reference
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
the
board
has
not
refused
to
draw
a
line,
but
what
i
ask,
has
it
taken
into
account
what
seems
to
me,
is
very
important.
if
it's
up
to
me,
i
may
(inaudible)
out,
that
the
board
has
the
right
to
draw
that
line
but
hasn't
drawn
it
or
it
had
just
assumed
from
the
employee
issues
that
as
to
non-employee
union
policy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
said
so.
but
doesn't
--
the
major
consideration
of
doing
obviously
what
it
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
in
all
cases
it
says
and
it
will
consider
all
supremacy.
i
take
it
the
board
has
ruled
that
the
--
the
employees
have
no
right
to
the
--
to
the
propaganda
is
within
the
plant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
whether
there
is
a
greater
facility
or
equal
facilities
on
other
(inaudible)
then
there's
no
occasion
for
using
employer's
(inaudible)
i'm
assuming
in
all
these
cases
that
there's
no
suggestion
from
union
and
for
any
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
through
(voice
overlap)
--
what
i
want,
i'd
like
to
be
referred
to
the
court's
opinion
in
which
they
canvassed
the
property
that
you
and
i
could
canvass
in
our
state
and
they've
considered
it
and
said
on
the
whole,
they've
never
been
able
to
account
we
reached
this
conclusion.
where
have
they
done
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
complaint
with
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
an
employee
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
you
well
know
that
this
is
the
--
this
is
at
(inaudible)
this
court
has
sent
cases
back
to
the
board
and
said,
you
have
great
experience
with
this,
and
so,
therefore,
you
have
wide
discretion.
but
your
rule
must
be
based
on
a
consciously
formulated
recognition
of
factors
that
lead
to
your
result.
way
back
(inaudible)
didn't
deny
the
policies
of
--
of
the
board
but
they
didn't
go
into
a
decision.
what
it
is
on
the
basis
on
the
basis
of
experience.
our
problems
mean
that
the
problems
i
can
see,
the
board
has
drawn
no
difference
between
employees,
(inaudible)
where
that
employee
persuaded,
a
non-employee
persuaded.
to
me,
there
is
a
considerable
difference.
if
the
board
in
the
result
of
its
experience
and
as
a
result
of
a
specific
consideration
as
a
respective
factor,
said
that
the
considerations
that
appeal
to
them
by
talking
are
unreal,
i
value
their
judgment.
but
they
haven't
done
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
decided
but
they
haven't
considered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
think
it
is
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
only
advisory
is
why
are
they
the
same
(inaudible)
this
is
your
way
to
the
fact
that
one
employee
talking
to
another
employee
is
very
different
when
it
is
an
outside
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
added,
considered
alternatives,
and
maybe
a
problem
in
burden
of
proof.in
the
case
of
an
employee
to
employee.
i
wouldn't
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
employee.
but
in
the
case
of
the
outsider,
i
would
put
it
on
the
outsider.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
has
it
dealt
with
this
problem
so
that
we
can
(inaudible)
being
spelled
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
get
to
perfectly
conclude
here
but
with
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
telling
us
without
indicating
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
law
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
spite
of
that
the
evidence
that
are
important,
apart
from
merely
legal
rights
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
case
have
anything
to
do
with
this
except
the
general
remark?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
at
all
to
do
with
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
fine
though,
but
you
don't
take
a
general
language
like
that
which
nobody
contest
out
into
a
totally
different
context?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
they
have
the
right
but
that
doesn't
enable
me
to
ascertain
what
the
duty
of
the
employer
as
to
--
with
regard
to
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
--
let
me
ask
you
a
question
that
somewhat
off
field
but
not
too
much
because
i
think
all
talk
about
the
rights,
justice
holmes
has
pointed
again
and
again
it's
treacherous,
right
is
the
end
and
not
the
beginning
of
an
argument
whether
it's
right
or
not.
could
the
whole
witnesses
distribute
their
circular
business
in
the
parking
place
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
which
you
are
not
familiar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
rejects
the
right,
the
right
of
communication,
the
constitutional
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
most
convenient,
i
should
think,
to
get
people
scattered
from
the
urban
community
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
can't
the
organizers
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
come
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
feel
it
would
be
much
more
sympathetic
to
that
as
the
right
with
an
abstract
discussion
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
this
in
--
i
--
i
don't
see
anybody
contest
--
could
contest
what
you
say
that
it's
more
convenient.
otherwise,
they
wouldn't
want
to
do
it.
but
you
seem
to
think
that
that's
an
end
of
the
matter
is
more
convenient
q.e.d.
could
the
employers
if
he
chose
--
if
he
chose
not
to
have
a
parking
lot
for
his
employees?
just
say,
you
--
you
come
out
and
park
your
car
wherever
you
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
uncle
sam
has
lots
of
employees
to
whom
it
doesn't
give
property
opportunities.
now,
of
course,
you
might
say
that
was
rebound
against
the
employer
because
people
wouldn't
work
there
but
he
could,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
could
--
if
i
talk
in
terms
of
right,
i
could
start
the
other
way.
is
it
this
property
right
and
therefore,
he
can
limit
the
use
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
argument
was
made
yesterday
that
there
are
subjections,
there
are
subjections
that
sought
liability
to
people
who
have
business
(inaudible)
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
says,
“why
must
i
subject
myself
pursuant
for
the
negligence
or
whatnot?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
depends
on
local
tort
laws.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
asking,
you
will
be
good
enough
either
now
or
file
a
memorandum
and
let
me
ask
the
rule
of
opinion
by
the
court
not
that
they
have
decided,
but
a
recent
explanation
why
they
had
decided
that
form.
it
was
suggested
there,
i
had
to
read
a
series
cases
and
i
readily
undertake
that
assignment
but
i
don't
just
want
to
have
the
decision.
i
want
a
recent
explanation
that
falls
by
the
board
guarding
this
vast
experience
that
there
are
no
differences
between
an
employee
organizer
and
nonemployee
organizer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
give
me
the
citation.
you
don't
have
to
give
me
any
speech
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
give
me
a
reference
of
nlrb
cases
that
i
can
read
in
which
the
board
set
forth
a
reason
ground
for
that
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
need
the
decision.
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
an
elucidation
that
there
is
no
difference
not
really
a
dogmatic
statement
that
there
is
no
difference
because
my
point
comes
in
--
does
find
a
series
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
argument
that
you
had
just
made,
you
have
drawn
on
what
the
board
has
done,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
would
tell
you
that
my
mind
is
rather
directing
me
in
the
direction
of
the
adequate
displayed
in
the
phelps
dodge
case.
and
if
that
is
the
experience
of
the
board,
we
are
entitled
to
have
it
spelled
out
and
not
drawn
by
inference
from
what
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
you
know,
when
the
case
went
back
and
help
us
god,
the
board
then
made
out
why
it
couldn't
do
it
in
each
case
and
lay
down
a
general
rule
and
--
and
this
court
accepted
that
and
nobody
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
point
is
it
hasn't
done
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
you
answered
justice
black
(inaudible)
affirmatively
or
negatively
is
dismissed
by
the
board.
