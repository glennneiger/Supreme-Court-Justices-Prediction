mr.
karl
h.
mueller
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
review
very
briefly
some
of
the
facts
here
presented.
some
of
which
had
been
touched
upon
by
our
brother
for
the
board.
the
respondent
is
engaged
in
conduct
that
of
a
manufacturing
business
on
a
track
of
land
of
some
25
acres
on
the
outskirts
of
an
oklahoma
town,
holdenville,
a
place
of
some
6000
folk
as
mr.
manoli
has
entered.
we
placed
in
evidence
and
have
in
the
record
before
the
court
a
plot
of
a
property
on
which
our
factory
building
is
situated.
it
appears
at
page
93
of
the
record.
reference
to
that
plot
will
indicate
that
the
company's
property
is
bounded
by
two
public
thorough
repairs.
the
one
on
the
south
being
denominated
the
airport
road,
it
will
be
observe
that
that's
a
dead-end
road,
and
the
one
on
the
east
or
the
front
side
of
the
factory
building,
if
the
court
please,
which
is
also
a
dead
--
dead-end
thorough
repair.
now,
we
don't
mean
to
indicate
by
calling
attention
to
these
facts
that
we
think
that
this
case
turns
on
facts
such
as
this,
but
we
point
to
them
because
of
the
emphasis
and
appearance
significance
that
the
board
attaches
to
different
facts
in
the
case
which
preceded
this
one.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
it's
--
if
your
honor
please,
it
runs
from
left
to
right,
from
the
--
(inaudible)
right-of-way
and
appears
right
below
airport
edition
and
is
dominated
access
road.
unfortunately,
the
individual,
mr.
justice
black,
who
put
that
in,
put
it
in
upside
down
which
wasn't
particularly
helpful.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
no,
the
access
actually
mr.
justice
reed
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
--
is
along
the
airport
road
from
town
and
then
one
may
turn
in
coming
to
the
plant
to
his
right
along
the
access
road
and
going
to
the
area
that's
marked
administrative
parking
in
front
of
the
building
or
he
may
proceed
along
the
airport
road
to
the
private
road
and
there
turn
to
the
right
by
means
of
which
he
would
gain
access
to
the
parking
area
which
lies
to
the
west
or
behind
the
factory
building.
these
roads,
the
record
shows
and
incidentally
these
facts
to
which
i
will
allude
are
all
undisputed,
we
don't
have
any
question
of
fact
resolution
at
all,
our
area
of
conflict
last
completely
within
the
--
a
matter
of
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
the
facts
proved.
it
was
suggested
yesterday
and
facts
in
these
cases
are
all
about
the
same
and
we
were
not
favored
with
a
brief
by
the
board
and
i
--
i
don't
say
that
critically
or
by
way
of
complaint.
the
board
didn't
brief
the
facts
of
our
case
but
instead
referred
to
its
brief
in
the
babcock
case
and
suggested
simply
that
the
questions
there
presented
are
the
same
as
those
here
presented.
we
most
respectfully,
but
nonetheless,
positively
disagree
with
that
suggestion.
this
is
one
small
facet
of
fact
where
the
cases
are
not
alike
and
in
saying
that
i
don't
mean
to
turn
my
back
on
my
brother
fisher
or
on
his
client
babcock
or
wilcox.
i
think
that
his
situation
is
one
that
speaks
for
itself
and
that
it
sound
on
its
own
facts
but
those
facts,
i
suggest,
are
different
from
those
here.
for
example,
in
the
course
of
the
argument
in
that
case
and
i
won't
labor
this
too
long,
counsel
for
the
board
suggested
that
in
the
babcock
case
the
employees
entered
upon
highways
where
there
were
no
parking
signs
that
would
prevent
people
from
stopping
and
where
the
speed
limit
was
65
miles
an
hour,
which
would
indicate
the
people
could
drive
along
in
such
fashion
that
it
might
be
difficult
for
them
to
be
estopped
in
time
to
be
in
importune
by
one
who
would
like
to
sell
a
union
membership.
in
short
contrast
to
those
facts,
we
have
these
dead-end
roads
which
come
down
one
to
the
airport
and
the
other
in
front
of
our
property.
the
facts
are,
and
the
record
is
undisputed
on
this,
that
these
roads
are
lightly
traveled.
now,
it
is
interesting
to
ask
because
of
the
emphasis
that
the
board
places
on
unlike
facts
in
other
cases
that
our
little
old
parking
lot
is
just
a
graveled
area
behind
our
factory
building.
it
isn't
fenced
off
from
the
plant
area.
when
the
employees,
most
of
them
are
women,
drive
their
cars
onto
the
parking
lots.
they
simply
parked
them
on
this
graveled
area
designated
private
parking,
utilizing
the
private
road
across
our
property
to
get
there
and
they
then
go
into
the
employee's
entrance
at
the
back
of
the
building.
none
of
this
property
is
open
to
use
by
the
public.
so,
we
immediately
distinguished
this
case
on
its
facts
from
the
holding
of
the
seventh
circuit
in
marshall
field
in
respect
to
holdenville
court
which
was
there
found
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
a
public
street.
it
turned
pretty
much
on
the
question
of
discrimination
as
we
view
that.
when
a
person
gains
access
to
our
parking
lot,
they've
got
access
to
our
factory.
we
don't
have
any
gig
houses
and
we
don't
have
any
guards
as
--
or
to
be
found
in
some
of
these
other
cases.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
"no
trespassing"
rule.
we
posted
this
property.
we
just
got
a
barbwire
fence
surround
the
outside
of
it
with
no
gates
at
the
entrances.
but
we
posted
our
property
as
we
used
that
term
sometimes
down
or
part
of
the
country.
we
put
up
large
signs,
notices
to
the
public
that
trespassing
on
our
property
was
not
permitted
and
that
the
roadways
to
the
parking
lots
were
private.
broadway
is
not
open
to
public
use.
we
don't'
mean
to
quibble
for
an
instant
with
this
court.
the
board
said
that
there
was
a
distinction
without
a
difference
when
we
suggested
that
a
"no
trespassing"
rule
and
i
know
distribution,
i
know
solicitation
rule
were
not
one
of
the
same
thing.
the
board
reason
that
a
"no
trespassing"
rule
would
keep
a
nonemployee
or
stranger
off
our
property
and
consequence,
it
would
prohibit
him
or
prevent
him
from
distributing
and
soliciting.
we're
bound
to
agree
with
that.
it
has
been
conceded
by
counsel
and
we're
grateful
to
him
that
there's
no
question
presented
in
this
case
concerning
our
motivation
in
adopting
the
"no
trespassing"
rule.
we
did
it
in
pursuance
of
our
rights
in
connection
with
the
ownership
and
use
of
our
private
property
and
the
board
hasn't
called
in
the
question,
our
motive,
for
posting
our
property
and
for
preventing
or
forbidding
trespassing.
and
neither
is
there
any
question
at
all
about
the
--
evenhandedness
with
which
that
rule
has
been
enforced.
it
has
been
nondiscriminatorily
enforced.
the
record
does
not
show
that
we
had
any
rule
which
prohibits
or
in
anyway
interferes
with
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
to
self-organization
under
the
act
on
our
property
during
nonworking
time.
the
case
boils
down
solely
and
simply
to
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
under
the
facts
of
our
case,
nonemployee
organizers
have
an
enforceable
legal
right
at
the
hands
of
the
board
to
take
and
to
use
our
property
in
connection
with
their
attempts
to
sell
their
wares,
namely,
union
membership.
we
find
no
fault
with
their
cause.
it's
not
within
our
problems
to
do
so.
it
isn't
--
whether
it's
good
or
bad
but
as
has
been
suggested
by
members
of
the
court,
the
question
that
bears
so
heavily.
in
our
thinking
is
where
is
the
appropriate
place
for
these
nonemployees
to
communicate
with
our
employees
in
an
effort
to
prevail
upon
them
to
take
membership
in
the
particular
labor
organization
of
which
that
nonemployee
organizer
is
in
turn
an
employee.
we
think
that
under
the
law,
we
are
required
not
to
interfere
with
or
to
restrain
or
to
coerce
employees
in
connection
with
the
exercise
of
their
rights
and
there's
no
contention
that
we
have
unless,
indeed,
the
nondiscriminatory
enforcement
of
our
"no
trespassing"
rule
has
cut
them
off
from
the
services
of
these
alleged
experts
in
the
intricacies
of
labor
law
in
connection
with
the
employees'
exercise
of
their
rights
on
the
act.
it's
of
no
consequence
but
i
can't
resist
the
temptation
to
observe
that
i
don't
think
that
the
american
worker
be
he
man
or
woman
is
so
lacking
in
understanding
of
what's
going
on
in
connection
with
labor
organization
in
the
last
20
odd
years
that
he
boards
along
epithetic
and
ignorant
of
his
rights
and
the
opportunities
that
await
him
if
he
desires
to
avail
himself
of
it.
this
union
is
not
the
representative
of
any
of
our
employees.
there's
no
contention
that
it
is.
so,
the
case
is
involving
access
to
tankers
for
representatives
of
collective
bargaining
agents
where
the
union
has
state
us
under
the
law
as
such
are
completely
beside
the
point.
the
case
stands
here
in
a
setting,
completely
free
of
unfair
labor
practices.
it
isn't
suggested
that
we
have
done
anything
at
all
in
contravention
of
the
law
except
to
enforce
our
nondiscriminatory
"no
trespassing"
rule.
now,
the
board
has
told
us
that
we
must
rescind
that
rule
and
that
we
must
accord
full
access
to
nonemployee
union
organizers
to
our
properly
for
use
by
them
in
carrying
on
their
organizational
activities
subject
only,
and
the
board
gratuitously
conversed
this
on
us
which
we
think
it
undertook
to
borrow
from
letourneau,
subject
only
to
such
reasonable
controls
as
we
may
make
as
--
and
nondiscriminatory
reasonable
regulations
as
we
may
make
that
will,
excuse
me,
ensure
plant
efficiency
and
maintain
discipline.
both
of
which,
we
suggest,
make
sense
when
they're
related
to
employee-employer
but
no
sense
whatsoever
when
related
to
a
landowner
as
the
respondent
in
this
case
and
a
stranger
who
would
enter
upon
and
use
his
profit.
in
this
case,
the
order
goes
farther
than
it
does
in
the
case
which
precedes
it
in
the
one
which
follows.
in
those
cases,
no
distribution
rules
were
involved.
ours
is
to
brought
"no
trespassing"
rule.
and
in
consequence
of
that,
the
board
has
not
only
told
us
that
we've
got
to
let
these
people
on
our
property
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
literature
but
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
union
memberships
and
that
opens
a
vastly
wider
field.
that
brings
on
the
area
of
discussion
without
question
and
raises
problems
that
the
order
and
the
decision
and
nowise
suggest
an
answer,
how
many
maybe
gathered
together
at
one
time
and
solicited
and
where.
and
in
that
connection,
as
a
practical
matter
and
--
and
we
do
have
to
be
practical
in
connection
with
our
attempt
to
operate
our
business,
the
area
which
the
board
order
would
require
us
to
open
up
and
turn
over
to
these
nonemployee
organizers
is
not
only
the
parking
lot
behind
the
building
but
the
area
between
that
park
lot
and
the
threshold
to
our
backdoor.
it
come
up
right
on
our
back
doorstep,
if
you
please,
and
take
that
order
as
a
forum
from
which
to
advance
their
arguments
to
employees
in
respect
to
whatever
message
they
have
to
deliver
in
connection
with
unionization
and
organization.
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
certainly
isn't
incumbent
upon
us
under
the
law.
now,
it
is
it
conferred
upon
the
board
by
the
act
to
require
us
to
provide
that
forum.
in
analyzing
the
board's
order,
we
find
it
bottomed
on
two
grounds
principally,
one,
the
alleged
virtual
impossibility
of
communicating
with
our
employees
off
our
property.
and
here,
may
i
take
note
of
the
fact
that
only
since
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
this
court
have
we
had
engrafted
on
the
question
in
this
case
accessibility
within
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant.
counsel
alluded
to
that
several
times
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
that
question
wasn't
litigated
before
the
board.
it
wasn't
before
the
court
of
appeals.
it's
never
been
contended,
prior
to
the
advent
of
the
case
in
this
court
that
accessibility
has
to
be
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant,
otherwise,
the
plant
property
must
be
condemned
to
the
use
of
outside
nonemployee
organizers.
the
court
below
correctly
found,
we
think,
that
the
board's
conclusion
that
it
was
impossible
or
virtually
impossible
or
unreasonably
difficult
to
communicate
with
our
employees
off
our
property
was
a
conclusion
to
use
judge
murrah's
language
that
is
not
legally
justified
by
the
facts.
he
had
put
the
record
to
the
test
for
that
court
applying
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
in
universal
camera
and
he
found
the
board's
conclusion
wanting.
there
was
no
support
in
the
record
taken
as
a
whole
that
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
communicate
with
our
employees
off
our
property.
and
we
think
that
when
this
court
comes
to
examine
the
record,
it
is
bound
to
reach
that
same
conclusion.
the
board's
finding
rest
on
the
flimsy
pretext.
maybe
i
shouldn't
call
it
that.
flimsy
argument
let
me
say.
that
would
be
more
polite.
that
number
one,
these
employees
live
in
holdenville,
two
thirds
of
them
in
holdenville
and
the
balance
of
them
within
five
or
10
miles
at
holdenville
and
that
the
employees
don't
stop
ordinarily
when
they
come
to
work
or
leave
work
in
the
evening.
and
let
me
take
just
a
minute
to
tell
the
court
what
the
record
shows
with
respect
to
this
so-called
nonstop
driving.
a
couple
of
girls
went
out
to
the
plant
one
afternoon,
two
years
ago
this
month
as
i
recall
it,
to
observe
what
happened
when
the
employees
left,
and
we
only
operate
one
shift,
the
girls
go
home
around
4:00
or
4:30,
they
got
into
their
cars,
they
drove
around
to
the
north
end
of
the
building
out
for
the
access
road
and
on
toward
town.
they
testified
that
most
of
them
were
bumper
to
bumper.
they
all
got
off
at
the
same
time
and
then
no
one
stopped.
but
the
thing
that
seems
to
us
absurd,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
is
the
undenied
fact
that
there
wasn't
anything
suggestion
that
there
was
any
reason
for
him
to
stop.
no
one
invited
them
to
stop.
no
one
asked
them
to
stop
to
receive
literature
or
to
stop
for
any
other
purpose.
and
because
of
that
happening
on
that
one
day
in
the
afternoon,
the
trial
examiners,
whose
findings
were
adopted
by
the
board,
drew
the
inference
they
came
to
work
the
same
way
in
the
morning.
i
don't
think
they
do
but
they
probably
don't
stop
upon
entering
upon
our
property.
absent,
there'd
be
in
some
reason
to
stop
and
i
suppose
normally
there
is
suppose
some.
and
when
we
undertook
to
argue
before
the
board
that
the
record
was
barren
of
any
showing
that
the
union
ever
attempted
even
raised
a
finger
to
invite
a
single
soul
to
stop
his
car
or
her
car
to
receive
a
piece
of
literature
or
to
engage
in
conversation
concerning
unions.
and
that's
the
way
the
record
stands.
this
record
is
barren
of
anything
to
show
that
the
union
ever
made
any
attempt
except
to
come
upon
our
property
and
station
themselves
on
our
backstep.
and
there
undertake
to
commandeer
what
we
think
would
amount
to
a
captive
audience,
if
you
please,
that
no
way
for
the
girls
to
escape
on
even
if
they
wanted
to
and
i
might
mentioned
in
passing
there
that
the
act
gives
the
employees
the
right
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
these
activities
as
well
as
the
right
to
engage
in
it.
but
the
board
with
the
wave
of
the
hand
simply
says
that
it
wasn't
necessary
for
the
union
to
make
an
attempt
because
of
the
nonstop
method
of
driving.
it's
obvious
that
the
attempt
would
have
been
futile
and
aborted.
and
so
there
isn't
any
evidence.
there
isn't
any
evidence
that
we
ever
in
anyway
interfered
with
the
union
organizer,
trying
to
meet
our
people
outside
our
property
on
the
roadway,
in
town,
at
home,
in
union
halls.
all
of
which
had
been
characterized
by
the
board
members
on
one
occasion
or
another
as
time
honored
and
traditional
means
for
communicating
their
employees.
and
these
were
the
special
circumstances.
what
these
girls
saw
that
one
afternoon
when
our
girls
left
the
job
and
had
no
reason
to
stop.
those
were
the
special
circumstances
that
cause
the
examiner
and
the
board
to
conclude
that
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
distribute
literature
to
our
employees
or
to
solicit
our
employees
off
company
property.
no
one
did
ask
that
judge
murrah,
speaking
for
the
tenth
circuit,
struck
it
down
and
said
it's
not
legally
justified.
judge
murrah
found
correctly,
we
think,
that
the
employees
were
easily
accessible
and
i
find
that
i've.
[laughs]
used
all
my
time
on
my
first
point
[laughs].
let
me
say
this
if
i
may.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
thank
you,
sir.
that
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
this
court
to
go
beyond
our
first
point.
the
board's
order
rest
on
alleged
nonaccessibility
or
inaccessibility
off
company
property
and
the
board
failed
to
prove
that
and
we
think
the
tenth
circuit
correctly
so
found
and
held.
judge
murrah
wrote
--
writing
for
that
court
said
that
there
was
no
impediment
amounting
to
the
serious
handicap
as
would
be
the
case
in
the
lumber
company
camp
where
the
man
had
to
live
and
there
was
the
tenancy
aspect
and
all
those
things.
none
of
those
things
are
present
here.
none
of
them
even
suggested.
and
so
the
court
concluded
that
below
that
our
nondiscriminatory
enforcement
of
our
"no
trespassing"
rule
did
not
constitute
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
it
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
and
that
brings
me
very
briefly
to
the
second
point
which
i
should
like
discuss
in
length
but
probably
it
wouldn't
add
anything
more
than
talk.
the
board's
order
is
predicated
on
the
patently
erroneous
assumption
that
the
rights
of
nonemployees
to
use
our
property
for
organizational
purposes
is
the
same
as
the
right
of
our
employees.
now,
it'd
be
presumptuous
of
me
to
tell
this
court
what
it
held
in
letourneau
where
everybody
knows
it's
generally
conceded
by
now
that
that
had
to
do
with
the
employees
who
were
on
the
property
as
a
matter
of
right
in
connection
with
in
pursuance
of
their
employment.
they
were
in
no
sense
trespassers
and
judge
murrah
made
that
observation
below
that
any
employee
on
its
employer's
property
engaging
in
self-organization
does
not
infringe
a
"no
trespassing"
rule
and
that's
the
only
rule
we
have.
that's
the
only
one
that's
in
issue.
we
think
that
this
is
pure
invention
of
the
board
to
attempt
to
extend
rules
that
seem
to
us
reasonable
when
applied
to
the
governance
of
the
employees
during
their
nonworking
time
while
they
are
on
their
employer's
property.
this
court
indicated
that
a
balance
had
to
be
struck
between
discipline
on
the
one
hand
and
property
rights
on
the
other
and
that
in
those
circumstances,
that
is
the
employer-employee
relationship,
it
was
proper
that
the
employer
should
have
the
burden
if
he
wanted
to
restrict
the
activities
of
the
employees
on
his
property
during
their
nonworking
time
to
show
that
the
restriction
was
necessary
in
terms
of
maintaining
production
or
preserving
discipline.
and
that's
the
thing
that
the
board's
undertaken
to
pull
out
of
letourneau
and
apply
against
us
and
actually
in
the
decision
in
our
case.
the
board
has
said
that
the
burden
was
on
us
to
approve
the
necessity
for
our
rule
in
respect
to
"no
trespassing",
lifted
it
bodily
out
of
letourneau.
and
if
your
honors
please,
in
our
case
all
they
did
was
to
say
that
our
contention
that
the
letourneau
thing
applied
to
employees
and
that
we
were
here
dealing
with
nonemployees,
they
said
that
was
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
that's
the
way
it
was
glossed
over
and
they
took
one
quick
look
at
thomas
against
collins
to
which
references
has
already
been
made
and
said
that
closes
the
gap.
it
follows
that
letourneau
stands
for
the
proposition
that
nonemployees
are
entitled
to
enter
upon
and
use
an
employer's
premises
for
organizational
activity.
we
say
that
burden,
of
course,
is
not
on
us
and
we
think
it's
--
it's
fantastic
really
--
pathetic
in
our
point
of
view
to
suggest
that
the
balance
that
was
struck
in
letourneau
should
be
struck
when
we're
confronted
not
with
the
employer-employee
relationship
but
with
the
relationship
of
an
employer
and
a
rank
stranger
who
would
undertake
to
sell
union
memberships
to
the
employees
in
the
plant.
this
convenience
argument
is
a
devilish
one,
if
i
may
say
so.
we
have
a
public
address
system
in
our
plant.
it
would
be
possible
to
address
the
employees
over
that.
that
would
be
more
convenient
than
using
the
parking
lot.
we
simply
say
that
the
case
can't
be
decided
upon
that
basis
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
was
correct
on
the
law
in
facts
and
that
it
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
so
much.
