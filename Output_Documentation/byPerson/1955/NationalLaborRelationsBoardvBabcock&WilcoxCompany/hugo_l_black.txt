(inaudible)
justice

i
ask

a
question
about
the
finding
on
the
charge
given?
the
examiner
found
that
that
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
examiner
seem
to
have
found
that
they
had
been
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practice
because
they
supplied
the
money
for
the
printing
or
distribution
of
(inaudible)
especially
the
printing
section
which
were
against
the
employees
joining
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
board
has
been
found
that
--
well
that
was
the
case
that
they
had
to
try
to
find.it
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act.
was
that
the
first
instant
when
the
board
made
a
finding
of
that
kind
that
a
company
that
supplies
money
to
print
--
antiunion
literature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
cleveland
trust
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
had
been
held
by
holding
that
it
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
they
did
not
accept
the
finding
of
the
trial
examiner,
did
they?
as
to
--
on
which
you
think
it
was
a
different
than
the
conclusions
to
when
it
violated
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
related
to
the
printing
and
being
for
the
printing
of
literature
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
the
company
to
be
distributed
by
certain
employees,
nonunion
employees
within
the
union
opposing
the
formation
of
the
union
in
plant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
asked
was,
was
this
the
first
instance
in
which
the
board
had
held
that
such
an
expenditure
by
the
company
for
that
purpose
--
by
company
for
that
purpose
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice?
was
that
a
departure
from
the
rule
which
you
get
it
for
exemption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right,
i
just
wanted
to
find
out
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
find
you
a
little
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
i
had
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
just
look
at
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
only
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
only
suppose
up
to
that
time
as
an
employer
paid
money
to
plant
or
keep
this
privilege,
add
in
union
literature
probably
was
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
was
just
a
little
surprise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
i
have
two
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
add
this?
i
don't
think
that
it's
quite
relevant
to
your
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
