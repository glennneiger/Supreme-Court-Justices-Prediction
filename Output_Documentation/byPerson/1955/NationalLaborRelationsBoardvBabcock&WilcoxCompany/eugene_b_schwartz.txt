mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
if
it
please
the
court,
i
find
myself
in
the
position
of
addressing
this
court
on
an
issue
as
to
which
--
much
are
many
of
the
collateral
legal
matters
have
already
been
discussed
by
counsel
in
the
two
previous
cases.
i
think
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
favor
us
with
a
written
opinion.
each
judge
in
one
entry
refers
only
to
the
letourneau
is
supporting
the
board's
decision
and
the
two
sixth
circuit
decisions,
to
wit,
the
lake
superior
lumber
company
and
monarch
machine
tool
company,
both
of
which
were
decided
primarily
on
the
basis
of
letourneau
and
republic
aviation
company.
now,
i
think
mr.
manoli
is
to
be
credited
for
his
frankness
yesterday
in
admitting
that
letourneau
has
a
difference
--
the
difference
between
latourneau
in
this
case
and
the
two
preceding
cases
lies
in
the
fact
that
letourneau
expressly
involved
only
employees
and
not
nonemployees.
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
the
quotation,
the
footnote
from
the
board's
brief
in
letourneau
before
this
court
where
the
board
expressly
said,
“we
did
not
consider
and
the
matter
is
not
before
this
court
now
as
to
what
would
happen
if
nonemployees
sought
to
come
on
to
the
parking
lot.”
yet,
for
all
practical
purposes,
both
by
a
brief
and
oral
argument
and
by
decision,
the
board
has
in
effect
held
that
letourneau
decided
this
case.
i
want
to
call
the
attention
to
just
one
unusual
feature
which
is
developed
since
yesterday
and
that
is
that
there
were
four
cases
decided
by
the
board
within
the
period
of
a
three-and-a-half
months.
monsanto
chemical
company
was
decided
by
the
board
in
108
n.l.r.b.
in
may
of
1954.
then,
seamprufe
was
decided
by
the
board
the
following
month,
the
109
n.l.r.b.,
babcock
and
wilcox,
109
n.l.r.b.,
ranco
109
n.l.r.b.
i
am
here
for
ranco
only.
you
would
suppose
that
with
four
cases
decided
within
a
period
of
three-and-a-half
months
on
the
same
basic
issue,
there
would
be
some
reference
in
the
fourth
case,
ranco,
to
the
three
preceding
cases.
but
the
fact
is
that
in
none
of
the
cases
which
followed
monsanto,
that
was
the
first
decided
in
may
of
1954,
is
there
any
reference
to
any
of
the
preceding
cases,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
quite
evident.
i
think
the
board
adopted
what
we
back
in
cleveland
called
a
(inaudible)
technique
or
the
rubber
stamp
technique.
here
is
the
parking
lot
situation
of
plant
in
the
outskirts
of
a
town
that's
letourneau.
look
at
the
--
i
have
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
record
in
monsanto
chemical
which
is
still
pending
on
the
docket
of
this
court.
incidentally,
this
is
the
first
case
decided
but
it's
still
pending
and
i
think
the
result
--
that
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
ninth
circuit
leaved
it
to
ninth
circuit.
it
seems
to
be
quite
behind
in
its
docket.
in
any
event,
if
you
look
at
record
18
and
19
of
the
monsanto
record,
you
will
find
that
the
board
in
monsanto
said
that
letourneau
is
dispositive.
that
was
the
argument
that
was
made
in
monsanto.
letourneau
was
dispositive.
of
course,
letourneau
related
to
employees
and
monsanto
involved
nonemployees.
what
happened
in
seamprufe?
i
think
mr.
--
i
paraphrase
mr.
mueller
when
i
say
that
in
seamprufe,
the
board
said
the
difference
between
an
employee
and
a
nonemployee
as
far
as
we're
concerned
in
applying
letourneau
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
babcock
and
wilcox,
i
do
not
have
the
benefit
of
their
record
which
incidentally
made
it
somewhat
difficult
for
us
to
understand
the
board's
brief
because
the
board
basically
just
said,
here's
the
copy
of
babcock
and
wilcox's
brief.
you
can
read
that.
reading
a
--
reading
a
brief
without
a
record
is
somewhat
difficult.
here's
what
the
board
found
in
our
case,
in
record
108
(a).
the
test
laid
down
in
letourneau
and
since
adhered
to
is
whether
the
prohibition
of
distribution
of
union
literature
places
an
unreasonable
impediment
on
the
freedom
of
communication.
well,
of
course,
that
isn't
what
letourneau
decided.
it
decided
that
the
prohibition
of
distribution
of
literature
by
employees
had
settled.
then,
what
did
the
board
say
in
its
expertness?
you
go
along
the
pages
so
after
quoting
letourneau
and
the
result
reached
is
the
same
though
the
distribution
is
sought
to
be
made
by
outside
organizers
rather
than
by
plant
employees.
where
does
that
come
from?
remington
rand
company,
103
n.l.r.b.,
number
25.
and
what's
the
support
in
remington
rand?
nothing
more
than
the
blank
it
state.
the
board
assumes
and
the
board
has
assumed
by
dictum
in
effect,
provided
by
it
that
when
this
court
decided
letourneau,
it
decided
all
parking
lot
cases.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
be
remising
my
obligation
to
this
court
and
to
my
client
if
i
did
not
discuss
the
evidentiary
fact
as
found
by
the
board
in
this
case
and
i
do
want
to
state
that
we
do
not
have
any
conflict
of
evidence.
the
board's
brief
here
on
page
2
in
our
brief
called
the
attention
to
the
fact
that
no
conflict
exist
on
evidentiary
facts.
we
are
fortunate
in
that
respect.
it's
always
this
tasteful
to
be
arguing
about
facts
particularly
to
a
higher
court.
but
we
start
with
this.
the
uaw-cio,
well,
i'd
come
back
for
a
little
moment.
here's
a
company
that
has
five
plants
in
the
state
of
ohio.
all
of
these
facts
are
found
by
the
board.
i
have
the
documentation
if
anyone
should
desire
it.
the
company
has
five
plants
in
the
state
of
ohio,
three
in
the
city
of
columbus.
those
three
plants
are
under
contract
with
the
machinist
union.
then,
it
has
a
plant
all
from
plain
cities,
some
24
or
25
miles
northwest
on
route
42.
and
it
also
has
another
plant
in
delaware,
ohio,
the
home
of
ohio
wesleyan
university,
and
that's
the
plant
that's
involved
here.
that's
also
on
route
42.
route
42
is
the
highway
between
cleveland
and
cincinnati
and
passes
to
the
west
of
columbus.
the
company
built
the
plant
in
delaware
in
1948
and
in
1950,
it
found
it
necessary
to
adopt
the
rule,
to
adopt
the
rule
with
respect
to
distribution
of
union
literature.
and
it
had
before
it,
the
benefit
of
this
court's
decision
in
letourneau.
it
had
before
the
benefit
of
this
court's
decision
in
republic
aviation.
it
had
before
it
the
court's
--
the
board's
decision
in
(inaudible).
and
adding
them
up,
it
was
quite
evident
that
it
did
have
the
right
to
--
to
prohibit
the
distribution
of
literature
within
its
plant
at
anytime.
that's
(inaudible).
under
the
circumstances
here,
it
felt
that
it
did
not
have
the
right
to
prohibit
the
distribution
by
employees
of
literature
on
its
parking
lot
or
outside
its
premises.
so
it
adopted
a
rule
which
went
beyond
letourneau.
it
adopted
a
rule
which
went
beyond
republic
aviation.
it
adopted
a
rule
in
effect
which
says
this,
it's
general
counsel's
exhibit
2
and
record
14
(a)
and
i
better
had
not
--
i
better
not
misquote
it,
“delaware
plant
employees
are
permitted
to
distribute
literature
on
company
property
but
not
on
company
time.”
so
you
see
they
went
whole
hog.
they
permit
the
employees
to
distribute
on
company
property
which
is
both
within
and
outside
the
plant.
any
such
distribution
must
be
done
in
such
a
manner
that
the
plant
buildings
will
not
become
littered.
further,
what
did
the
board
find?
the
board
find
that
--
it
found
that
the
employees
availed
themselves
of
that
privilege.
at
104
(a)
of
the
record,
the
board
found
that
the
--
the
petitioner,
i'll
thought
of
ranco
because
we
were
the
respondent
in
the
court
below,
uniformly
permitted
employees
to
distribute
literature
of
the
guardhouse
gates
between
the
plant
and
the
parking
lot.
both
union
and
anti-union
literature
has
been
passed
out
there
by
employees
without
hindrance
from
ranco.
what
happened
inside
the
plant?
and
i
might
state
that
trial
counsel
has
always
at
an
advantage
over
counsel
that
comes
in
later
because
you
can
visualize
some
of
these
things
better.
within
the
plant,
we
freely
permitted
employees
to
wear
large
cio
buttons
while
at
work.
a
sample
of
one
is
an
evidence
that
respondent's
exhibit
3,
unfortunately,
they
take
a
picture
of
this
button,
but
respondent's
exhibit
b
is
a
large
button
both
join
uaw-cio
organizing
committee.
their
employees
exercising
the
rights
which
they
have
under
the
act,
democracy
in
action,
and
then
they
permit
them
to
wear
t-shirts
bearing
the
cio
emblem
and,
unfortunately,
for
the
purpose
of
not
encumbering
the
record.
we
did
not
put
one
in
evidence
but
it
was
described
as
follows.
the
t-shirt,
on
which
appears
in
blue
about
six
inches
in
diameter,
the
emblem
of
the
international
union,
uaw-cio,
and
above
which
--
which
appears
in
red
in
letters
varying
from
one
to
two
inches
in
size
both
and
below
which
appears
in
red
in
letters
varying
from
a
half-inch
to
one-inch
in
size
and
the
words
uaw-cio
and
employees
wore
those
t-shirts
in
the
plant
without
hindrance
and
the
board
so
found.
and
if
you
can
visualize
a
plant,
that
of
some
700
people
on
two
or
three
shifts
with
man
running
around
with
those
t-shirts,
you
will
realize
that
we
have
walking
billboards
in
our
plant
and
that's
all
right
with
us.
we
say
yes
to
the
employees,
“you
have
the
right
to
do
that.”
no
hindrance.
all
of
these
facts
add
up
to
full
and
open
recognition
by
this
employer
of
its
employees'
rights
to
self-organization
as
guaranteed
to
them
by
the
act.
the
sum
total
of
its
actions,
evidence
to
its
employees
of
anything
included
that
they
were
free
to
engage
and
they
did
engage
in
organizational
activity.
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
looking
on
the
page.
that
--
that
order
to
the
extent
that
has
been
interpreted
as
being
limited
to
employees.
the
--
the
board's
order
directs
us
to
extend
that
to
nonemployees.
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
oh,
yes.
well,
i'm
--
i'll
be
glad
to
get
to
that.
the
board
expressly
found
that
our
--
that
our
--
i
have
a
citation
right
here.
the
board
expressly
found
that
our
rule
which
limited
the
distribution
of
literature
on
company
property
to
employees
was
non-discriminatorily
enforced
and
i
hadn't
got
into
that
because
mr.
manoli
admitted
that
with
respect
to
all
three
cases.
but
specifically,
it
found
that
just
about
the
same
time
that
we
had
this
problem
with
the
uaw-cio,
the
women's
auxiliary
of
the
american
legion
and
the
veterans
of
the
foreign
wars
requested
opportunity
to
come
on
to
our
property
to
sell
buddy
puppies,
that's
an
annual
thing
as
you
know
and
somewhat
distastefully,
but
it
was
our
rule
and
it
was
enforced
against
all.
we
were
required
to
tell
them
and
the
--
and
that
is
in
the
record.
we're
required
to
tell
them
that
our
rule
were
required
or
rather
restricted
distribution
of
literature
on
our
--
on
our
property
only
to
employees.
that's
at
page
37
(a).
it
is
to
ms.
rowena
myers
who
happened
to
be
the
woman
who
had
written
the
letter,
the
reference
is
made
to
letter
in
regard
to
selling
buddy
puppies.
it
has
always
been
our
policy
to
refuse
any
selling,
distributing,
half-passing
a
handbill,
etcetera
to
any
employee,
to
any
person
not
an
employee
of
ranco.
an
employee
of
ranco
may
do
these
things
as
long
as
it's
done
on
the
employees'
time.
as
a
result,
we
must
deny
a
request
and
the
board
fairly
and
correctly
found
that
we
had
non-discriminatorily
enforced
that
rule.
well,
then,
someone
might
say
in
view
of
these
walking
billboards,
in
view
of
these
large
badges,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
employees
were
exercising
their
right
to
self-organization
why
were
we
before
the
board.
well,
let's
come
to
the
charge.
the
charges
in
the
record
as
on
page
3
(a)
and,
of
course,
the
labor
board
must
accept
the
charge
and
to
the
extent
that
it's
applicable
here.
the
charge
filed
by
the
uaw-cio
which
did
no
more
than
to
initiate
the
proceedings.
i
want
to
be
fair
about
that.
if
you're
not
tried
on
the
charge,
you're
tried
on
the
complaint
which
the
board
subsequently
issues.
the
charge
said
that
the
employer
denied
the
uaw-cio,
the
right
to
distribute
literature
on
the
employers
premises
at
a
location
which
was
the
only
location
at
which
the
representatives
of
the
union
could
effectively
distributes
its
literature
as
said
employee
left
the
premises
of
said
employer,
although,
said
employer
permitted
the
distribution
of
anti-union
literature
at
said
location
on
its
premises.
in
other
words,
the
union
originally
charged
us
for
discrimination
which
would
be
a
different
case.but
the
board
after
investigation
did
not
charge
us
with
discrimination.
the
board
after
investigation
and
it's
at
paragraphs
5
and
6
of
its
complaint
at
page
6
(a),
in
effect
charged
us
with
denying,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
with
preventing
the
union
and
its
agents
and
representatives,
and
they
finally
explained
that
they
meant
nonemployee
agents
and
representatives
because
obviously
the
employees
were
also
agents
and
representatives,
preventing
the
representatives
from
circulating
or
distributing
among
the
employees
of
said
plant
in
the
parking
lot
and
elsewhere
on
respondent's
premises
pamphlets,
literature
and
other
written
or
printed
material.
now,
i
emphasize,
they
were
--
we
were
charged
and
tried
with
only
one
thing
preventing
nonemployee
organizers
from
distributing
pamphlets,
literature
and
other
rented,
written
or
printed
material.
note
that
at
no
time
were
we
charged
with
denying
them
a
forum
for
discussion
and
arena,
a
spot
and
which
they
could
answer
questions
and
interchange
ideas.
we
were
not
charge
with
that.
we
were
not
tried
with
that
but
we
will
come
later
to
a
point
which
will
show
that
the
board
basically
based
its
decision
not
on
the
ostensible
reasons
but
on
the
lack
of
opportunity
in
the
union
to
corral
our
employees
whether
or
not
they
desire
to
be
corralled
and
to
talk
to
them
to
convince
them
with
or
against
their
will
of
the
benefits
of
union
organization.
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
what
is
the
page,
sir?
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
yes,
sir.
yes,
we
were
absolved
from
that,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
yes,
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
the
complaint
was
dismissed
--
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
--
with
respect
to
paragraph
7.
in
other
words,
there
--
there's
only
--
there's
one
narrow
issue
before
us
and
i
might
mention
that
the
record
show
--
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
it
was
five
and
six.
they
were
actually
duplications,
mr.
justice
reed.
if
you
compare
five
and
six,
you
will
find
that
--
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
no,
you
asked
about
seven.
yes,
they
are
now
--
to
mr.
justice
reed.
mr.
eugene
b.
schwartz
seven
were
dismissed
by
the
board.
it
is
not
before
this
court.
so
now,
we
come
--
now,
we
come
to
january
of
1953
and
mr.
rubin
peters,
according
to
the
findings
of
the
board,
he's
sent
by
his
superiors
in
detroit
to
delaware,
ohio
to
organize
the
employees
of
the
delaware
plant.
that's
his
job.
that's
a
job
of
an
international
representative.
he
so
testified.
he
issues
a
circular.
the
first
circular
is
issued
of
january
22nd.
that's
in
evidence,
general
counsel's
exhibit
6
of
page
18
(a)
and
it
was
distributed
at
the
fence
gates.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
how
many
copies
were
distributed.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
that
at
the
fence
gates,
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment,
he
and
two
other
union
representatives
distributed.
now,
let's
visualize
that.
here's
a
road,
u.s.
route
42,
a
very
heavily
traveled
thoroughfare,
which
passes
through
delaware,
ohio.
delaware
is
a
town
of
some
12,000
people,
the
home
of
ohio
wesleyan
as
i
mentioned
before.
it
has
offices
and
the
union
had
an
office
from
the
very
start,
the
union
had
a
telephone.
the
union,
according
to
its
own
circulars,
had
eagles
hall
which
apparently
was
large
enough
so
they
invited
the
employees
and
their
sweethearts
and
their
wives,
so
the
union
had
all
these
facilities
available
to
it.
this
was
not
in
the
wilderness
somewhere.
ranco's
plant
is
right
within
the
--
right
within
the
city
limits,
1.7
miles
i
believe
from
the
--
from
the
heart
of
town.
the
speed
limit
of
that
point
on
route
42
is
35
miles
per
hour.
the
record
shows
that
it's
heavily
traveled
and
heavily
pleased.
there's
a
34th
area
between
the
roadway
itself
and
the
fence
which
encloses
the
ranco
property.
that
30-foot
roadway
is
public
property.
employees
entering
the
plant
must
stop
and
employees
leaving
the
plant
must
stop.
there's
been
so
much
mentioned
about
non-stop
with
respect
to
these
other
cases
and
i
--
i
must
point
out
the
fact
that
the
board
found
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
union
representative's
testimony
that
at
least
90%
of
the
car
stopped.
the
board
also
found
on
the
testimony
only
of
this
union
representative
that
in
the
wintertime,
he
also
complained
because
some
of
the
cars
that
stopped
didn't
open
up
their
windows
so
he
could
give
them
literature.
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
why.
i,
as
an
employee,
have
to
open
up
my
window
to
get
literature
if
i
don't
want
it
but
let's
put
that
aside.
he
testified
that
in
the
wintertime,
50%
of
the
cars
did
stop
to
receive
literature.
and
in
the
summertime,
75%
of
the
cars
did
stop
and
accepted
literature.
so
i
think
he
did
a
pretty
good
job.
and
was
this
on
one
occasional?
no.
it
was
on
25
different
occasions
between
january
22nd,
1953
in
october
when
we
tried
the
case
over
there
in
delaware.
on
25
different
occasions,
but
after
the
first
occasion
when
he
issued
literature,
he
writes
us
and
says,
“we
request
permission
to
distribute
literature
on
your
company
property.”
now
--
and
i
will
not
go
in
to
the
nature
of
the
literature
although
that
would
be
something
else.
i've
also
adverted
to
the
fact
that
the
union
maintained
an
office
in
the
telephone
in
delaware
and
that
the
eagles
hall
was
available
to
it
and
was
used
by
it.
now,
i
might
mention
because
someone
has
mentioned
something
about
jehovah's
witnesses.
the
decision
in
martin
versus
struthers
apparently
gives
a
member
of
jehovah's
witnesses
the
right
to
--
oh,
to
knock
on
my
door,
but
it
also
preserves
for
me
the
right
to
slam
my
door
in
his
face
and
not
to
take
his
message.
and
the
law,
which
now
provides
that
the
employee
has
a
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
and
the
right
to
refrain
from
such
activities
also
gives
the
employee
the
right
to
say,
“i
don't
want
to
open
my
window.
i
don't
want
to
read
that
trash.”
and
i
say
that
because
there
is
some
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
that
employees
considered
it
trash
and
were
highly
incensed
and
that
is
in
the
record
at
some
of
the
statements
made
about
them
as
well
as
against
the
company.
so
we
find
that
on
25
different
occasions
with
90%
of
the
cars
stopping,
a
physical
situation
under
which
we
enforced
and
the
state
police
enforced
stop
rules
not
out
in
the
country
and
so
this
brings
or
somewhere
else
but
right
in
a
busy
city.
the
union
representatives
have
opportunity
on
25
occasions
and
the
employees
themselves
on
seven
or
eight
occasions
distribute
union
literature,
other
employees
distributing
nine
union
literatures
within
the
plant.
well,
the
board
then
and
again
without
any
reference
to
anything
except
letourneau
says,
“well,
there's
unreasonable
difficulty.
there's
(inaudible)
technique
as
i
call
it.”
what's
the
real
reason?
i've
have
been
scouting
that
and
i
think
i
finally
find
it
not
only
in
the
briefs
but
in
the
argument.
what
were
these
difficulties?
well,
the
so-called
difficulty,
your
honor,
if
it
is
important,
was
not
in
distributing
literature.
that
was
on
freewill.
that
was
done
openly.
and
remember,
there's
no
background
of
any
espionage,
threats
or
anything
else.
we
have
the
walking
billboards
and
all
that.
the
difficulty
of
the
union
representative
here
and
it
appears
in
the
board's
findings
and
appears
in
the
argument
here
was
in
getting
employees
who
might
not
want
to
accept
union
literature
to
open
their
doors
or
to
be
stop
somewhere
so
that
union
literature
could
be
given
to
them.
the
difficulty
was
in
getting
those
employees
to
discuss
with
the
union
representatives,
to
discuss
only
not
to
distribute
union
literature.
there
is
a
significant
comment
in
the
board's
brief
in
this
case
at
page
11.
the
board's
brief
in
this
court
at
page
11,
and
i
stressed
that,
placed
down
the
effectiveness
of
the
distribution
of
literature
by
the
nonemployees.
it
placed
down
the
distribution
of
literature
by
the
employees
and
then,
here's
what
it
says,
“moreover
and
more
important,
although
fellow
employees
may
pinch
it
to
distribute
literature,
the
employees
generally
are
deprived
of
ready
access
to
union
representatives.”
and
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
in
number
250,
that
babcock
&
wilcox,
these
representatives
are
by
virtue
of
their
training
and
background
full
time
--
full
time
specialist
constituting
the
employees
best
source
of
information
about
unionism
and
that
is
basically
what
brother
manoli
mentioned
here
in
the
closing
of
his
argument,
that
when
you
--
you
distribute
literature
to
someone,
it
evokes
questions
and
then
you
have
an
opportunity
for
discussion.
but
remember
the
very
narrow
issue
that
--
on
which
we
were
tried,
the
very
narrow
complaint
issued
against
us
that
we
were
preventing
them
from
distributing
pamphlets,
circulars
and
other
rented,
written
and
printed
literature.
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned,
the
expertness
of
the
man
who
--
who
draws
or
designs
that
circular
and
there
were
cartoons
and
everything
else
is
completely
immaterial,
assuming
that
it
takes
expertness
and
training
for
full
time
men
to
write
circulars.
the
only
question
here
is
where
can
they
distribute.
shall
--
shall
we
have
imposed
upon
us
the
--
the
duty
to
make
them
or
let
them
distribute
at
locations
other
than
those
--
the
locations
where
they
have
so
effectively
distributed
in
the
past?
and
i
questioned
very
frankly,
if
it
please
the
court,
whether
--
whether
even
the
government
here
who
contend
that
it
takes
full
time
specialist
to
distribute
in
hand
out
literature,
it
may
take
full
time
specialist
to
do
that
which
the
board
now
seeks
to
make
us
do
and
that
upon
which
we
were
not
tried.
if
that
allegation
had
been
intended,
it
should
have
been
--
it
should
have
been
issued
against
us.we
should
have
tried
that
case
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
argue
that
case
below.
now,
what's
the
effect
of
the
ruling
here?
the
effect
of
the
ruling
is
that
we
must
help
the
union
organize.
you
can't
get
beyond
that.
the
most
effective,
i
believe,
is
a
phrase
that
was
used
yesterday.
i
took
rather
copious
notes
and
i
hope
i
was
not
disobeying
any
rule
of
court
and
being
so
busy
and
taking
notes.
the
phrase
yesterday
was
used
frequently
that
the
most
logical
place,
the
most
reasonable
place
and
the
most
effective
place
in
which
to
distribute
literature
is
there.
yes,
i
will
agree.
the
most
effective
place
possibly
in
which
to
sell
insurance
is
at
meeting
of
doctors
or
of
lawyers
and
yet,
no
one
says
that
an
insurance
man
for
that
reason
has
to
be
given
that
opportunity.
it's
nice
to
have
things
made
easy
for
you
but
by
the
same
token.
we
have
no
right
to
tell
our
employees,
each
of
our
employees,
"look,
you
must
open
your
window
when
you
get
to
that
--
when
you
get
to
that
stop
sign
so
the
union
representative
can
give
you
literature."
if
that
had
happened,
i
believe,
even
the
board
would
say,
"well,
now,
we
can't
do
anything
about
it
because
each
of
the
employees
has
an
opportunity
to
get
the
literature."
can
we
tell
that
to
our
employees?
we
say
no
under
the
statute.
the
statute
gives
them
the
right
to
say,
"i
don't
want
that.
i
want
no
part
of
your
literature."
and
we
say
the
government
cannot
force
us
to
do
that
which
the
law
does
not
require.
i
think
it
was
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
reed
in
stowe
spinning
had
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
law
forbids
only
interference
and
i
think
there
are
quotations,
abundant
quotations
in
the
beard
case
which
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
convenience
is
not
the
test
that
the
usual
method
of
solicitation,
radio,
periodicals,
mail,
local
agencies
are
open,
the
usual
methods
of
seeking
business
are
left
open
and
that
the
mere
fact
that
such
methods
do
not
produce
as
much
business
is
constitutionally
immaterial.
and
i
think
basically,
that
is
the
issue.
now,
i
don't
want
to
work
across
purposes
and
i
see
that
i
had
only
a
few
moments
left
in
which
i
would
like
to
reserve
for
--
for
rebuttal.
but
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
board
has
made
much
here
of
the
fact
that
in
babcock
&
wilcox,
that
was
the
first
case
presented
by
the
board
and
i
think
quite
logically,
if
i
were
the
board,
i
would
want
that
case
first
too.
we
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
had
this
nonstop
method
of
driving
in
babcock
&
wilcox
in
our
case
whether
we
have.
the
board
finds
90%
stop
from
50%
to
75%
to
open
their
windows
and
get
literature.
the
board
referred
to
the
fact
that
there
is
open
country
in
60
miles
per
hour
whether
we
have
here
35
miles
per
hour
and
heavily
pleased.
the
board's
counsel
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
the
babcock
&
wilcox
case,
when
these
outside
union
representatives
wanted
to
distribute
that
defense
case,
the
local
authorities
were
called
by
the
management
and
stop
their
distribution.
what
do
we
have
here?
no
such
fact.
25
occasions,
25
separate
occasions
in
five
months.
and
then,
board
counsel,
i
believe,
also
called
the
attention
of
the
fact
that
in
babcock
&
wilcox,
the
employees
were
not
permitted
to
distribute
where
for
they
needed
help.
the
fact
is
that
is
not
here.
we
have
an
affirmative
record,
if
it
please
the
court,
a
record
on
which
affirmatively
and
positively
shows
the
fullest
recognition
by
an
employer
of
the
rights
of
his
employees
and
even
more
important,
the
fullest
exercise
by
those
employees
of
those
rights.
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
finding
of
the
court
below
that
letourneau
in
effect
was
dispositive,
fell
into
the
same
error
that
the
board
had
fallen
into.
thank
you.
