mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
with
the
fifth
circuit.
the
principal
question
which
is
presented
by
this
case
and
the
two
companion
cases
which
follow
this
one,
is
whether
non-employee
union
organizers
are
entitled
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
distribute
literature,
union
literature,
on
a
plant
parking
lot,
where
it
is
either
impossible
or
unreasonably
difficult
for
them
to
distribute
such
literature
in
the
vicinity
of
the
plant.
the
court
below
thought
that
there
was
no
warrant
for
--
under
the
statute
for
such
an
intrusion
upon
the
employer's
property
and
it
accordingly
it
rejected
the
board's
finding
that
the
employers
prohibition
directed
against
these
non-employee
union
organizers
from
distributing
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot
was
an
unreasonable
impediment
to
the
exercise
--
to
the
employees
to
exercise
their
rights
under
the
statute
and
constitute
interference
and
reframe
it
in
the
meaning
of
section
8(a)(1)
of
the
statute.
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
seamprufe
case
which
follows
this
one
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
(inaudible)
case
which
is
presently
pending
on
the
board's
petition
for
certiorari.
the
court
has
not
yet
acted
on
it,
have
agreed
with
fifth
circuit's
views
on
this
question.
on
the
other
hand,
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
ranco
case
which
is
the
third
case
of
the
series
of
cases
to
be
argued
and
the
fourth
circuit
i
might
say
in
two
cases
which
are
not
now
before
this
court,
have
agreed
with
the
board
that
such
a
prohibition
under
these
circumstances
constitutes
interference
and
restraining
in
meaning
the
section
8(a)(1)
of
the
statute.
the
factual
picture
in
these
cases,
all
three
of
these
cases,
i
will
not
attempt
to
give
all
at
one
time
now,
but
i
might
say
that
the
factual
picture
in
these
cases
is
substantially
the
same.
in
this
particular
case
here
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
there
are
some
--
some
differences,
but
i
believe
that
they
are
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they're
all
non-employees
in
these
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
case.
that
that
--
the
prohibition
here
in
all
these
cases,
in
all
three
of
these
cases
is
directed
against
non-employee
or
outside
union
organizers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true
in
the
ranco
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
perhaps
not
in
that
respect.
we
think
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
will
call
attention
to
that,
your
honor,
when
i
come.
i'm
sure
that
the
other
side
will.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
there's
not
a
real
difference
of
opinion
on
that,
your
honor
within
the
board.
there
is
a
real,
there's
been
a
difference
of
opinion
within
the
board
as
to
whether
or
not
the
organizers,
whether
it's
unreasonable
or
--
or
impossible
for
these
organizers
to
reach
these
employees
away
from
the
plant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
has
not
drawn
that
distinction,
your
honor
and
i
know
of
no
case
with
a
--
a
disagreement
based
upon
that
--
upon
those
differences
between
the
boards
as
among
the
board
members
themselves.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
perhaps,
your
honor
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
your
honor
is
thinking
of
the
letourneau
case
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
that's
quite
right.
there
the
prohibition
is
i'm
going
to
say
in
detail
somewhat
later.
the
prohibition
was
directed
against
the
employees.
in
these
--
in
these
cases
here,
the
difference
between
letourneau
and
this
one
here
is
principally
that
here,
the
prohibition
is
directed
against
these
outside
organizers
who
are
not
employees.
there
is
this
difference
however,
your
honor.
i
might
say
this
with
respect
to
these
cases.
that
in
the
last
of
these
cases,
there
were
some
employees
who
were
members
of
the
union
and
whom
the
company
permitted
to
distribute
literature
on
the
parking
lot.
i
didn't
mean
to
minimize
that
factor.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
hope
to
show
that
it
would
not
be
material.
but
i
--
i
think
i
made
an
error
perhaps,
when
i
said
that
there
was,
for
these
cases,
are
substantially
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
yes,
of
course.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
substantially
the
same.
that's
right.
i
will
hope
to
demonstrate
that
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that
was
not
the
question
of
distribution
of
literature
but
solicitation
of
membership
and
the
wearing
of
union
button.
but
that,
too,
is
in
those
--
in
that
case,
too,
which
was
a
companion
of
letourneau.
the
prohibition
was
directed
against
in
the
one
case,
employees
distributing
literature,
in
the
other
case
the
employees
soliciting
union
membership
and
wearing
buttons.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
stowe
case
had
a
considerable
differences
between
stowe
and
this
case.
its
true,
that
in
stowe,
we
were
dealing
with
some
outside
union
organizers.
but,
of
course,
there
the
question
was,
whether
they
were
entitled
to
a
theatre
which,
whether
they
were
entitled
to
use
a
meeting
hall.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
considerably,
i
think
your
honor.
i
am
aware
that
your
honor
thought
that
--
that
in
the
stowe
spinning
case
that
you
felt
that
the
theatre
was
not
an
adjunct
to
the
business.
and
--
but
i
think
that
we
can
properly
say
that
here
that
the
parking
lot
is
an
adjunct
to
the
plant
just
as
it
was
in
the
--
in
the
--
the
letourneau
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
the
--
that's
right.
they
did.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
then
i
will
address
myself
to
this
particular
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
is
a
question
of
balancing
considerations.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
i
shall
address
myself
to
this
particular
case,
although,
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor,
i
think
the
considerations
which
we
think
support
the
board's
order
in
this
case,
also
support
the
board's
order
in
the
other
two
cases.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right.
now,
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
facts
in
this
case
here.
the
company's
plant
here
is
located
in
paris,
texas.
they
are
near
--
in
a
rural
area
near
paris,
texas.
it's
approximately
one
mile
from
the
city
limits
of
paris,
texas
and
approximately
several
miles
from
the
center
of
the
city
of
paris,
texas.
paris,
texas
has
a
population
of
approximately
21,000
people.40%,
approximately
40%
of
the
--
of
the
500
employees
of
the
company,
live
in
paris,
texas.
the
other
60%
of
the
employees
live
in
widely
scattered
communities
within
a
radius
of
some
30
miles
from
the
plant.
there
is
virtually
no
public
transportation
to
and
from
the
plant.
and
because
of
that,
virtually,
all
of
the
employees
ride
to
and
from
work
in
private
automobiles
where
they
plant
or
where
they
park
their
automobiles
in
the
plant
parking
lot
which
is
adjacent
to
the
plant
itself.
the
--
the
employees
normally
do
no
stop
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
plant
either
as
they
are
leaving
the
plant
or
as
they
are
coming
to
the
plant
to
work.
they
normally
come
on
to
the
plant
parking
lot,
park
there,
and
then
go
on
to
the
plant.
and
when
they
leave
in
the
evening
they
then
get
into
their
cars
as
they
normally
drive
away
from
the
plant
will
stop
--
without
stopping
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
plant
area.
and
i
would
presume
they
would
drive
on
home
or
the
nearby
city.
the
--
the
parking
lot
is
connected
with
the
highway
which
passes
the
plant
by
driveway
which
is
about
100
yards
in
length
and
some
30
feet
in
width.
this
driveway
which
connects
the
parking
lot
and
the
state
highway
is
over
company
property,
except
for
the
last
30
some
odd
feet
next
to
the
highway,
where
it
passes
a
public
right
of
way.
along
the
road
as
the
--
the
maximum
speed
on
this
highway
as
it
passes
the
plant
is
60
miles
an
hour
and
posted
along
the
plant
are
no
stop
--
not
stop
signs
that
have
been
put
there
by
the
authorities.
now,
in
1953,
the
union
here
was
attempting
to
organize
the
company's
employees.
and
sometime
that
in
several
occasions
during
the
summer
of
that
year,
they
went
to
the
plant
and
stationed
themselves
at
the
--
near
the
intersection
of
the
state
highway
or
the
state
highway
and
this
driveway
at
the
place
where
it
is
--
crosses
the
public
right
of
way
adjacent
to
the
state
highway.
i
hope
i
made
myself
clear
as
to
where
they
were
standing.
they
started
and
began
to
handout
literature
--
literature
to
the
employees
at
that
place
and
as
a
result
there
was
traffic
jam
that
was
created.
and
the
local
authorities,
who
meanwhile
had
been
called
by
the
company,
ordered
the
union
representatives
to
discontinue
distributing
literature
at
that
place
because
it
created
this
traffic
jam
and
created
a
serious
traffic
hazard.
thereafter,
the
union
representatives
wrote
to
the
company
asking
for
permission
to
distribute
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot
as
the
employees
came
to
work
or
as
they
left.
the
company
replied
saying
that
it
has
generally
forbidden
the
distribution
of
any
kind
of
literature
on
its
premises,
and
for
that
reason
it
declined
to
grant
the
union's
request.
simultaneously,
with
its
effort
to
distribute
the
literature
at
the
--
near
the
plant,
the
union
also
sought
to
reach
the
employees
at
their
homes
and
in
the
nearby
town
of
paris.
however,
the
union
was
able
to
obtain
only
the
names
of
about
100
of
the
500
employees
and
was
able
to
mail
literature
only
to
the
--
to
the
one-fifth
of
the
working
force.
and
while
some
60%
of
the
employees
have
telephones,
the
union,
of
course,
was
able
to
reach
some
of
them,
but
record
doesn't
show
just
how
many
they
were
able
to
reach.
and
the
record
also
shows
that
the
union
reached
or
contacted
or
communicated
with
some
of
the
employees
on
the
streets
of
the
nearby
town
at
the
nearby
town
of
paris.
these
are
substantially
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
in
a
rural
area,
your
honor,
approximately
one
mile
is
from
the
city
limits
of
this
town
and
approximately
several
miles
from
the
center
of
that
town.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
employees
just
simply
don't
stop
in
that
area.
they
just
simply
go
right
on.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
they
wanted
to.
there
are
no
stop
signs,
your
honor.
there
are
no
stop
signs
along
the
road
there.
and
the
maximum
speed
of
that
road
as
i
--
i
said
a
moment
ago,
some
60
miles
an
hour.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
--
there
are
undoubtedly
are,
some
open
fields
in
--
in
that
area,
but
normally,
the
employees,
since
the
record
shows,
do
not
stop
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
plant.
they
just
simply
get
in
their
cars
in
their
parking
lot
and
drive
on
home
or
in
the
morning
they're
coming
from
their
homes
at
the
nearby
town
and
they
drive
directly
on
to
the
driveway
and
into
the
parking
lot.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
about
200
feet,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
testimony
is
that
the
distance
between
the
parking
lot
and
the
plant
is
some
200
feet
in
this
--
in
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
both
the
--
both
the
parking
lot
and
the
plant
and
the
area
in
between,
that
is
all
company
property,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i
think
it
would
might
be
helpful
if
we
turned
to
the
map
which
is
on
pages
225
of
the
record.
you
will
notice
here,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
minton
that
the
parking
lot
is
at
the
top
of
that,
pages
225.
now,
at
the
bottom
of
the
line
which
the
--
which
--
which
marks
as
a
parking
lot,
there's
a
small
letter
d
and
then
there's
a
little
road
there.
that
road
leads
to
a
sort
of
a
plant
gate
and
the
employees
enter
into
that
plant
gate
to
enter
the
plant
itself
or
gate
house
as
they
call
it.
now,
the
driveway
that
leads
from
the
parking
lot
to
the
state
highway
is
the
one
at
the
--
almost
at
the
extreme
bottom
right
--
right
hand
corner
of
the
parking
lot.
that's
approximately
a
100
yards
long
and
some
30
feet
in
width
and
the
distributors
of
the
--
the
representatives
of
the
union
who
sought
to
distribute
literature
on
these
occasions
that
i've
mentioned,
stood
at
that
place
which
is
at
the
very
end
of
that
driveway
and
is
marked
by
a
circle.
and
that
--
and
that
is
where
the
driveway
crosses
a
--
public
right
of
way
which
is
adjacent
to
the
highway
itself.
now,
that
intermediate
area,
your
honor,
between
the
parking
lot
and
the
buildings,
my
understanding
is,
that
is
owned
by
the
company.
that
is
company
property.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
--
we,
it's
our
--
it's
the
board's
position
that
unless
these
union
representatives
are
permitted
to
have
access
on
this
parking
lot
that
they
would
be
unable
to
reach
the
employees.
and
that
it's
either
impossible
or
extremely
difficult
for
them
to
reach
the
employees
anywhere
near
in
the
vicinity
of
the
plant.
and
with
respect
to
reaching
them
away
from
the
plant
at
their
homes
and
in
the
city
as
i
will
come
to
later,
there
are
very
serious
difficulties
that
the
union
encounters
in
attempting
to
reach
them
there.
now,
from
the
facts
that
i
had
summarized,
the
board
found,
and
i
believe
i've
already
indicated
this
to
some
extent,
the
board
found
that
it
was
either
impossible
or
unreasonably
difficult
for
the
union
representatives
to
distribute
literature
to
the
employees
away
from
the
plant
area
in
the
vicinity
of
the
plant
itself.
and
that
this
and
because
of
that,
the
employer's
prohibition
against
the
distribution
of
the
literature
on
the
parking
lot
deprived
the
employees
and
the
union
organizers
of
an
important
avenue
of
communication
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
this
literature
so
as
to
seriously
impede
the
employees'
right,
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
receive
organizational
literature
from
the
--
from
the
organizers.
the
board
concluded
that
the
impediment
was
serious
as
to
constitute
interference
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
statute.
and
accordingly,
it
directed
the
company
to
permit
the
union
organizers
to
distribute
literature
on
the
front
parking
lot
subject
to
reasonable
and
non-discriminatory
regulations
in
the
interest
of
time
efficiency
and
discipline.
the
court
below,
as
i
have
already
indicated,
disagreed
with
the
board.
it
concluded
that
since
these
organizers
were
not
employees,
but
in
this,
outsiders,
non-employee
organizers
and
since
in
its
view
the
employees
could
be
reached
in
the
nearby
town,
that
the
prohibition
did
not
invade
or
bridge
any
rights
of
the
employees
themselves
or
constitute
a
serious
impediment
to
the
employees'
exercise
of
their
rights
under
the
statute.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
principal
distinction
between
these
to
these
cases
or
in
this
case
and
the
letourneau
case,
here
is
the
--
the
prohibition
here
is
directed
against
--
is
directed
the
non-employees.
whereas,
in
the
letourneau,
the
prohibition
was
directed
against
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
were
criticized.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
court
has
on
two
occasions
in
the
radio
officer
case
which
your
honor
wrote
the
opinion
for
this
court
and
also
the
universal
camera
case,
your
honor
has
twice
said
here
in
the
court
--
this
court
has
twice
said
it
seems
to
us
that
the
statute
has
not
been
--
has
not
affected
the
validity
to
those
--
those
two
cases,
either
letourneau
or
the
republic.
the
--
in
the
letourneau
case,
this
court
sustained
the
board's
ruling
which
set
aside
an
employer
rule
which
prohibited
the
employees
from
distributing
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot.
this
court
agreed
with
the
board
that
in
that
situation,
the
employer's
naked
proprietary
interest
or
his
naked
control
over
his
property,
was
to
be
weighed
in
the
balance
against
the
employees'
interest
in
the
effective
exercise
of
their
rights.
and
this
court
also
agreed
with
the
board
that,
since
on
the
one
hand,
the
prohibition
was
not
necessary
for
the
protection
of
any
legitimate
interest
of
the
employer
and
since,
on
the
other
hand,
it
deprived
the
employers
of
an
important
and
otherwise
appropriate
avenue
of
communication
with
respect
to
the
distribution
and
receipt
of
organizational
literature,
that
the
board,
setting
aside
of
the
employer's
ruling
--
rule
against
the
distribution
of
literature,
represented
an
appropriate
and
a
valid
accommodation
between
the
employees'
interest
and
the
effective
exercise
of
their
rights
under
the
statute
and
the
employer's
naked
proprietary
interest.
the
considerations
which
underlie
that
decision,
and
which
we
think
are
relevant
here,
were
that
--
were
the
employees
as
in
that
case,
at
their
homes
or
dwellings
scattered
over
a
wide
area
that
it
is
difficult
and
often
impractical
to
have
any
systematic
distribution
of
literature
to
them
at
their
home.that
from
a
practical
standpoint,
the
logical,
the
natural
and
perhaps
the
most
effective
place
for
the
distribution
of
literature
is
in
the
plant
area.
and
that
even
though,
as
in
that
case,
the
employees
were
not
wholly
inaccessible
away
from
the
plant
as
they
would
have
been
if
they
had
worked
in
a
mining
camp
or
a
lumber
camp
which
was
owned
by
the
employer,
let
them
work
in
a
place
like
that,
that
even
though
they
were
not
wholly
inaccessible
away
from
the
plant,
nevertheless,
the
employer's
prohibition
against
the
distribution
of
the
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot
created
such
a
serious
impediment,
deprived
them
of
a
--
an
otherwise
appropriate
and
important
avenue
of
communication
that
on
balance
the
--
it
was
--
it
was
wholly
proper
for
the
board
to
subordinate
the
employer's
naked
proprietary
interest
to
the
employees'
interest
in
the
effective
exercise
of
their
rights
including
their
right
to
receive
organizational
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
know
of
no
case,
your
honor,
which
has
presented
that
to
the
board
and
i
suspected
that
probably
it
might
be
--
it
would
make
a
serious
difference
if
the
employer
doesn't
own
anything.
he
doesn't
have
to
supply
--
supply
something
which
he
doesn't
already
have.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
does
not
permit
even
the
employees
to
come
into
the
plant
to
distribute
literature,
your
honor.
that's
under
(inaudible)
case
the
--
the
board
has
drawn
that
line.
while
it
--
the
employees
are
entitled
to
permit
to
distribute
literature
on
the
front
parking
lot,
the
board
has
never
permitted
employee,
even
employees
to
come
into
the
plant
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
know
of
no
case,
your
honor,
where
the
board
has
permitted
the
distribution
of
literature
inside
the
plant.
it
feels
that
there,
the
--
the
balance
is
in
favor
of
the
employer
because
of
the
danger
of
littering
and
other
factors
--
that
flow
from
the
--
the
distribution
of
literature
within
the
plant
itself.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
available?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
not
so
much
of
question
of
making
them
available,
your
honor.
it's
the
question
of
the
employees
themselves
exercising
their
own
right
to
receive
organizational
literature.
and
that
determination
should
not
be
made
by
the
employer
as
to
whether
they
will
be
available
to
--
or
to
--
to
the
organizers
or
not.
but
that
decision
should
be
made
by
the
employees
themselves.
in
fact
i'm
quite
sure.
i
just
spelled
out
the
considerations
which
we
thought
this
court
rested
--
rested
in,
in
deciding
the
letourneau
case
and
which
we
think
are
applicable
here,
the
board
in
that
case
as
i've
said,
sought
to
balance
the
competing
interest,
the
naked
proprietary
interest
of
the
employer,
the
employer
as
against
interest
of
the
employees
in
the
effective
exercise
of
their
rights
under
the
statute.
in
these
--
in
this
case,
if
i
may
add,
and
the
other
two
cases,
that
are
here
for
argument,
the
board
has
also
weighed
the
competing
interest.
on
the
one
hand,
it
has
found
that
to
set
aside
the
prohibition
against
the
distributing
of
literature
on
the
parking
lot
by
these
outside
organizers,
that
the
employer
suffers
an
inconvenience
which
is
no
more
substantial
than
the
inconvenience
which
the
employer
suffers
in
the
letourneau
case,
where
the
distribution
of
the
literature
is
being
made
the
employees
themselves.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
more
than
that,
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that
was
true
in
the
letourneau,
in
the
republic
case
where
it
was
a
question
of
solicitation.
here,
i
think
it's
something
more
than
that.
that
is
that
there
is
a
distribution
of
literature.
now,
if
--
if
the
distribution
of
literature
in
the
letourneau
case
caused
so
slight
an
inconvenience
to
the
--
to
the
employer,
that
on
balance
it
should
not
outweigh
the
way
the
employer's
interest
in
the
effective
exercise
of
their
rights
in
the
statute,
so
here
we
say
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
it's
their
right
to
receive
organizational
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
understand
that
is,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
at
this
point
i'm
trying
to
--
i'm
trying
to
make
the
point
that
the
inconvenience
which
the
employer
suffers
from
permitting
these
--
permitting
these
outside
organizers
to
come
into
the
parking
lot
with
the
purpose
of
distributing
literature
at
the
inconvenience
from
a
practical
standpoint,
is
no
different,
really,
than
the
inconvenience
which
he
suffers
when
the
employees
themselves
distribute
the
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
know,
your
honor,
but
what
difference
is
there
really
from
a
practical
standpoint
between
the
employees
handing
out
a
piece
of
literature
to
fellow
employee
or
the
union
organizers
handing
him
this
piece
of
literature?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i've
--
that's
relevant
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
what
i
think
is
at
the
core
of
this
case.
and
i
think
it's
a
fact
to
which
the
court
below
has
overlooked.
that
essentially,
here,
we
are
concerned
with
the
rights
of
the
employees
to
be
informed
because
it
is
our
position
that
whether
--
whether
the
distributors
of
the
literature
be
these
outside
organizers
or
whether
they
be
the
employees
themselves,
that
at
bottom,
what
is
fundamentally
involved
in
these
cases
is
the
right
of
the
employees
to
receive
organizational
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
at
the
parking
lot
where
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
know.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
hope
i'm
not
assuming
the
answer.
i
was
trying
to
develop
the
considerations
which
i
think
the
board
has
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
has
balanced
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
in
a
--
in
a
series
of
cases
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
including
these
and
as
a
matter
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
between
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor.
it
has
--
it
has
drawn
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
two
cases,
your
honor,
on
page
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
has
drawn
a
difference
with
--
it
has
taken
into
consideration
the
fact
that
these
organizers
are
non
--
are
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
has
made
the
consideration
this
way,
your
honor.
that
where
the
outside
organizers
are
able
to
reach
the
employees
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant,
in
the
public
--
public
area,
to
mean
the
vicinity
of
the
plant,
the
board
in
those
cases,
unlike
the
employee
situations,
has
said
we
will
not
permit
the
outside
organizers
to
come
on
to
the
plant
and
parking
lot,
because
they
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
distribute
literature
to
the
employees
in
the
public
area
in
the
--
in
the
--
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
important
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
that's
quite
true,
your
honor.
there
is
no
discrimination
at
all
and
these
are
--
there's
no
suggestion
of
that
kind,
here,
any
more
than
letourneau
case.
and
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
they
--
let
me
start
--
start
off
by
saying
this,
your
honor,
that
the
board
has
regarded
these
cases
as
not
significantly
different
from
the
letourneau
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
--
in
these
cases
here,
the
board
following
the
same
lines
of
approach
that
it
followed
and
which
is
as
we
thought
this
court
approved
in
the
letourneau
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
understand.
it
has
balanced
these
competing
--
this
has
balanced
these
competing
considerations
and
it
has
concluded
that
the
natural,
the
logical,
perhaps
the
most
effective
place
for
the
distribution
of
literature
in
a
situation
like
this
is
either
is
somewhere
in
the
plant
area,
either
in
the
public
area
adjacent
to
the
plant
area,
in
the
immediate
vicinity
to
the
plant
or
on
the
parking
lot.
where
the
outside
organizers
are
able
to
reach
the
employees
on
the
public
area
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant,
the
board
says,
we
will
not
permit
them
to
come
on
to
the
plant.
but
in
situations
however,
where
they
aren't
--
where
they
employees
aren't
accessible
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant,
then
the
board
has
balanced
the
competing
considerations
at
the
inconvenience
to
the
employer's
relatively
slight,
no
greater
than
it
that
was
in
the
--
than
the
letourneau
case
and
that
the
--
however,
on
the
other
hand,
that
the
impediment
to
the
employees'
right
to
receive
literature
is
a
serious
one
because
if
deprives,
it
--
it
forecloses
what
is
in
those
circumstances
the
most
important
and
effective
avenue
of
communication
between
the
employees
and
the
outside
organizers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
they've
considered
them
in
the
sense
that
this
is
a
largely
the
same
kind
of
a
problem.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
let
me
go
back
to
the
considerations,
your
honor
which
were
--
which
underly
the
letourneau
case,
which
i
think
are
significant
here,
as
i
indicated
before.
that
case
seems
to
rest
up
on
these
considerations
which
the
board
about
virtue
of
the
record
in
that
case,
its
experience
within,
in
the
facts
of
industrial
life
drew
mainly
that
where
the
employees'
homes
are
scattered
over
a
wide
area,
that
it
is
difficult
and
impractical
to
reach
them
whether
it
be
by
the
employees
themselves
or
by
outside
organizers
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
literature.
that
in
that
situation
whether
its
employees
who
are
involved
or
whether
its
outside
organizers
that
are
involved,
the
natural
and
the
most
effective
and
the
logical
place
for
the
distributors
of
literature
to
get
together
with
the
employees
is
in
the
--
in
the
plant
area.
and
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
does
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
cannot
refer
you
to
any
one
single
case.
i
think
you
must
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
i
can
only
--
i
can
only
say
this.
that
the
board's
rule
with
respect
to
these
cases
is
discussion
of
them
must
be
obtained
from
reading
a
series
of
cases
all
of
which
have
been
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
there's
a
difference,
we
think,
between
those
two
situations.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
let
me
indicate
why
we
think
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
was
just
wondering
if
i
could
take
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
a
little
more
of
my
time
on
--
on
the
--
the
next
case
if
that's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
my
argument
on
this
one.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
with
respect
to
the
distributors
of
literature,
they
aren't
under
the
same
kind
of
handicap
or
difficult
when
it
comes
to
distributing
literature
that
the
union
organizers
are.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
to
all
the
homes,
that's
right.
but
he
is
just
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
they
--
because
their
homes
are
scattered.
very
often
the
organizers
doesn't
have
the
names
of
all
the
employees.
whereas,
in
the
case
of
a
--
in
the
case
of
a
person
distributing
new
literature
he
merely
has
to
go
up
and
down
the
street
and
pass
them
out
to
whoever
is
coming
by
or
simply
go
from
one
house
to
the
next.
but
that
is
impossible.
that,
of
course,
cannot
be
done
by
the
union
organizers
because
obviously
in
a
community
such
as
this
as
the
record
here
shows
the
employees
homes
are
scattered
within
a
radius
of
some
30
miles.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
the
same
would
apply
there.
that
he
can
reach
them
somewhere
else.
the
--
and
the
distribution
of
literature
of
this
kind
of
literature,
has
a
special
protection
under
this
statute.
it
is
not
like,
as
this
court
said
in
--
in
the
martin
versus
hunter's
if
i
remember
correctly
that
you
can't
lump
constitutional
rights,
or
rights
which
are
protected
by
the
statute
with
the
right
to
sell
tea
kettles
or
what
have
you.
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two.
i'll
stop
here,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
from
the
tenth
circuit
and
it's
the
second
of
the
series
of
cases
that
involved
this
parking
lot
question
which
we
were
discussing
yesterday.
here
as
in
the
case
which
we
discussed
or
argued
yesterday,
the
question
is
whether
this
nonemployee
union
organizers
are
entitled
under
the
labor
act
to
distribute
(inaudible),
your
honor,
on
parking
lot
word
is
unreasonably
difficult
to
make
such
distribution
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant.
the
facts,
if
i
may
summarize
quite
briefly,
are
these.
the
company
here
operates
a
plant
on
the
outskirts
of
holdenville,
oklahoma.
holdenville
has
a
population
of
about
6000
people.
the
company
has
a
breaking
force
of
about
200
workers
and
these
200
workers,
some
40%
of
them
live
in
holdenville
or
--
excuse
me,
two
thirds
of
these
200
employees
live
in
holdenville
and
the
remaining
one-third
live
within
a
radius
in
and
around
holdenville
of
five
to
10
miles.
again,
in
this
case,
there
is
virtually
no
public
transportation
to
and
from
the
plant
and
as
a
result,
the
employers
ride
to
work
in
private
automobiles.
they
--
record
discloses
that
normally.
they
do
not
stop
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
of
the
plant
as
they
come
to
work
but
that
they
drive
directly
from
the
highway
which
is
adjacent
--
which
is
adjacent
to
the
plant
property
onto
a
private
road
and
the
private
road
leads
into
the
parking
lot.
the
parking
lot
is
located
about
a
distance,
i
would
guess
from
the
map
of
somewhere
around
150
somewhat
feet
between
100,
perhaps,
150
feet
from
the
plant
proper
and
when
the
employees
park
their
cars
in
the
plant
parking
lot,
they
cross
over
from
the
plant
parking
lot
over
into
the
plant
proper.
the
record
also
discloses
that
the
employees
normally
do
not
stop
when
they
leave
the
plant.
they
leave
the
plant.
they
get
--

to
the
--

to
the
parking
lot.
they
get
into
their
cars
and
they
drive
along
private
road,
inside
the
plant
area
onto
to
the
public
highway
and
then
onto
their
homes,
somewhere
else
it
maybe
going.
now,
on
a
typical
day,
the
record
also
discloses
that
these
200
workers
leave
in
about
80
automobiles
and
that
these
automobiles
driving
at
speeds
ranging
from
five
to
20
miles
per
hour
here
at
the
plant
area
in
a
matter
of
five
to
10
minutes.
in
1953,
the
union
here
was
seeking
to
organize
the
company's
employees
and
on
several
occasions,
the
representatives
of
the
union
went
to
the
plant
and
station
themselves
at
the
edge
of
the
parking
lot
and
as
the
employers
came
out
of
their
automobiles,
they
sought
to
either
talk
to
them
or
to
distribute
literature
to
them.
the
company's
representatives
noticed
this
and
ordered
the
union
representatives
to
leave
the
place
because
they
were
trespassing
on
his
property.
this
in
some
--
these
and
some
are
the
facts
in
this
case
on
which
the
board
found
that
it
was
because
of
the
employees
nonstop
method
of
driving
to
and
from
the
plant
to
the
immediate
vicinity
of
plant
that
it
was
unreasonably
difficult
for
the
union
organizers
to
reach
these
employees
for
the
purposes
of
distributing
literature
or
the
--
for
the
purpose
of
soliciting
union
membership
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant
to
the
public
area
and
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant.
and
that
accordingly,
the
employers
forbidding
the
union
representative
to
distribute
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot
constituted
a
serious
impediment
to
the
employees'
right
to
receive
organization
literature.
and
it
found
that
the
employer's
ousting
or
prohibition
against
the
distribution
of
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot,
as
in
the
other
case,
constituted
interference
with
the
meaning
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
and
accordingly
as
in
the
other
cases,
it
indirect
the
employer
to
permit
the
union
representatives
to
distribute
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot
subject
to
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
regulations
in
the
interest
of
prime
efficiency
and
discipline.
the
court
below
did
not
disturb,
when
this
case
came
before,
it
did
not
disturb
the
board's
finding
that
the
employees'
nonstop
method
of
driving
to
and
from
the
plant
made
it
unreasonably
difficult
for
the
union
representatives
to
reach
the
employees
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
literature
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant.
it
held
however
or
rejected
the
board's
finding
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
had
been
committed
here
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
these
representatives
who
sought
to
distribute
literature
were
strangers
to
the
employees'
rights
under
the
act,
the
employees'
right
of
self-organization.
and
secondly,
that
the
employees
were
easily
accessible
in
the
nearby
town
of
holdenville,
which
i've
indicated
had
a
population
of
about
6000
--
6000
and
where
two
thirds
of
the
200
employees
live.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
two
considerations
which
this
court
in
agreement
of
where
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
case,
which
we
discussed
yesterday,
felt
more
decisive
and
felt
precluded,
the
adjustment
which
precluded
or
militated
against
the
adjustment
which
the
board
had
made
here
between
the
competing
interest.
the
first
of
this
is
the
--
these
--
these
representatives
are
strangers
to
the
employees'
rights
of
self-organization.
we
think
that
this
conclusion
rest
upon
the
erroneous
premise,
the
communication
between
trained
organizers
--
organizers,
union
organizers
and
the
employees
is
not
an
incident
of
the
rights
which
the
act
infers
upon
the
employees
themselves
for
purposes
of
self-organization.
this
court
in
the
thomas
versus
collins
case
had
occasion
to
note
that
included
in
the
bundle
of
rights,
which
he
act
confers
upon
the
employees,
is
the
right
to
be
informed
concerning
union
matters.
and
that
he
correlative
of
that
right,
this
court
continued
in
that
case,
is
the
right
of
the
union
to
reach
the
employees
and
to
inform
them
and
to
distribute
literature
to
them
concerning
organizational
matters.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
--
that's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it's
entirely
different
case,
your
honor.
i
--
i'm
--
but
there
is
that
language
in
that
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
it's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
will
come
to
that,
your
honor,
if
i
may.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
whether
the
literature
is
distributed
by
outsiders
or
by
the
employees
themselves.
in
either
case,
what
is
fundamental
at
stake
here
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
court
below
and
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
what
is
fundamental
at
stake
here
is
the
employees'
right
to
receive
organizational
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
that's
the
next
question
is
where.
the
court
here
thought
that
because
the
employees
were
accessible
in
the
nearby
town
--
where
easily
accessible
in
its
own
words,
in
the
nearby
town
of
holdenville
that
the
--
in
prohibition
against
the
distribution
of
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot
did
not
constitute
a
serious
impediment
to
the
employees'
exercise
of
this
right
to
receive
organizational
literature
and
to
be
informed.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
decision
and
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
reed,
as
i
--
in
--
in
this
context,
it
seems
to
us
that
what
the
court
has
overlooked
is
the
critical
factor
that
the
natural
--
the
most
effective
and
the
most
important
place
for
the
distribution
of
literature
to
employees,
the
place
where
there
can
be
any
kind
of
systematic
distribution
of
the
literature
where
the
employees,
who
will
receive
it
will
get
the
full
benefit
of
it,
is
at
the
plant
area
before
they
scatter
to
the
four
corners.
there,
the
employees
are
able
to
answer
--
to
ask
questions
at
the
organizers
or
able
to
confer
with
their
fellow
employees
as
to
the
significance
of
this
literature
and
it
seems
to
--
and
as
against
that,
as
against
that
although
the
employers
are
not
wholly
inaccessible,
as
the
court
said
--
as
the
court
below
said,
are
not
wholly
inaccessible
in
the
nearby
town.
nevertheless,
access
to
them
in
the
nearby
town
does
not
permit.
what
we
think
--
does
not
permit
the
systematic
and
effective
distribution
of
union
literature
which
can
be
accomplish
at
the
plant
area.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
am,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
not
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
because
of
this
consideration,
your
honor,
i
would
distinguish
the
jehovah
type
of
distribution
from
the
one
here
that
the
plant
area
is
not
necessarily
the
most
effective
or
the
--
or
the
natural
place
for
the
distribution
of
such
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
can
reach
them
in
the
town
or
they
can
go
from
home
to
home.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
cannot
do
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
organizer
has
to
have
a
list
of
the
names.
frequently,
he
cannot
obtain.
being
an
outsider,
you
cannot
obtain
a
list
of
all
the
employees'
names.
in
the
case,
which
we
had
yesterday,
i
mentioned
that
out
of
the
500
employees,
the
organizer
was
able
to
obtain
only
100
names
and
their
addresses.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
more
or
less
that
the
discretion
of
the
employee
whether
he
will
do
that
or
not.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
there's
an
additional
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
whether
they
could
get
that
information?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
no
--
no
case,
your
honor,
is
that
--
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
even
with
the
names,
your
honor,
with
the
names
and
addresses,
there
are
still
serious
difficulties
that
the
union
encounters
especially
where
the
homes
of
these
employees
are
scattered.
unlike
the
jehovah
witnesses,
who
can
simply
go
from
one
home
to
the
next
because
they
are
not
making
any
--
they're
not
making
a
selective
choice.
they
simply
can
go
from
one
home
to
next
and
dropped
the
literature
on
the
porch
or
wherever
or
give
it
to
the
homeowner.
here,
even
if
the
union
does
have
a
list
of
their
names,
it
means
that
it
has
to
go
to
--
that
the
employees
are
scattered.
they're
not
contiguous
and
it
faces
their
difficulties
of
having
to
find
these
employees
at
home
at
night
after
they've
come
to
work.
and
the
employer
at
that
time
may
not
be
in
a
very
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
that
question
does
intrigue
me
in
the
course
of
my
preparation
for
this
case
is
just
what
the
status
of
these
people
would
be
if
they
fell
or
broke
a
leg.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
doesn't
help
us
solve
this
particular
problem.
conceivably,
the
kind
of
obligation,
which
the
employer
might
have,
might
depend
upon
what
the
right
of
the
organizers
is
under
the
statute
to
come
in
onto
those
premises
and
then,
you
might
be
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
then
you
might
depend
upon
tort
laws
to
what
the
obligation
of
the
employer
was.
it
might
be
a
situation
where
--
although
these
and
organizers
are
entitled
under
the
act
to
enter
the
premises
for
purposes
distributing
literature
that
nevertheless
for
purposes
of
tort
law.
they
would
not
be
recognized
is
having
anymore
--
anymore
rights
than
perhaps
to
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
we're
not
--
i'm
not
--
they
say
it's
a
very
intriguing
question.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
natural
--
the
natural
and
an
important
avenue
of
communication,
your
honor.
that
was
the
situation
it
seems
to
us
in
the
letourneau
case.
in
the
letourneau
case,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion,
that
plant
was
not
like
a
mining
camp
or
a
lumber
camp
where
the
employees
both
work
and
live,
so
that
the
employer
--
so
the
organizers
had
to
reach
them
on
company
property
or
otherwise
not
reach
them
at
all.
and
this
court
also
noted
that
there
was
no
finding
in
that
case,
the
distribution
of
the
literature
away
from
the
parking
lot
would
be
ineffective.
nevertheless,
this
court
concluded
in
agreement
with
the
board
that
the
prohibition
against
the
distribution
of
literature
on
that
plant
parking
lot
deprived
the
employees
of
a
natural
and
an
important
avenue
of
communication
and
that
the
depravation
was
so
serious
that
the
employers,
what
i
term
is,
naked
proprietary
control
over
his
property
on
balance
was
to
be
subordinated
to
the
employees'
interest
in
the
effective
exercise
of
their
right
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
to
be
informed.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
may
--
if
i
may,
i
would
attempt
to
answer
that
today.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
are
these
cases
which
are
now
before
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
no
such
case
which
elucidates
that
in
for.
but
the
board
has
started
all
from
the
letourneau
case
and
it
is
taken
into
consideration
a
practice
which
it
took
into
consideration
of
letourneau
case,
that
where
the
employees
are
scattered
over
a
wide
area
that
from
its
knowledge
a
plant
life,
the
industrial
realities
that
it
is
necessarily
difficult
and
often
impractical
to
reach
his
employees
at
their
homes.
and
again,
on
the
basis
of
that
experience
which
had
used
in
the
letourneau
case,
it
has
concluded
that
the
natural,
the
most
appropriate
place
for
the
distribution
of
literature
is
in
the
plant
area
and
it
has
addressed
itself
to
the
problem
of
whether
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
the
outside
organizers
and
the
employees
themselves.
it
is
done
that
in
these
cases,
as
well
as
in
a
two
cases,
(inaudible)
and
--
or
not
the
case
which
name
was
(inaudible)
but
is
in
our
brief,
where
the
board
has
said
with
respect
to
the
employees,
the
employer
may
not
forbid
the
--
may
not
forbid
them
from
distributing
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot
unless
he
comes
forward
with
proof
that
it
is
interfering
with
plant
discipline
or
operation.
but
in
the
case
of
the
outside
organizers,
the
board
does
not
permit
the
outside
organizers
to
come
into
the
plant
parking
lot
if
the
employers
are
reasonably
accessible
in
the
public
area
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant.
it
is
only
where,
as
in
these
cases,
that
it
is
either
impossible
or
unreasonably
difficult
for
this
outside
organizers
to
reach
the
employees
in
the
public
area
and
the
--
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant
that
the
board
has
concluded,
the
employer's
naked
proprietary
interest
may
on
balance
be
appropriately
subordinated
to
the
employees'
right
to
receive
this
organizational
law.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
seven-up
cases,
the
court
indicated
that
--
that
the
board
could
rely
on
it's
cumulative
--
cumulative
experience
and
it
did
not
have
to
necessarily
lay
it
out
in
each
case
and
that
it
could
draw
upon
its
experience
from
the
records
in
all
of
these
cases
and
then
sum
up,
sum
up
the
end
product
of
that
experience.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
have
no
doubt,
your
honor,
that
the
court
--
the
board
could
have
done
so
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
--
i
can't
point
to
any
particular
case
where
the
board
has
spelled
these
considerations
seriatim,
but
i
think
that
that
is
what
we
gather
from
reading
all
the
board
decisions
in
the
light
of
--
not
only
those
decisions
but
in
the
light
of
its
experience
in
the
letourneau
type
of
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
we've
--
we
had,
of
course,
a
case
like
the
lake
superior
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
there,
the
--
involved
a
lumber
camp
where
the
employees
both
lived
and
worked
in
the
company
property.
and
the
question
in
that
case
was
whether
the
outside
organizers
were
entitled.
one,
to
go
into
the
lumber
camp
and
two,
into
the
bunkhouses
where
the
employees
lived
and
slept
and
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
with
us
there
that
these
outside
organizers
were
entitled
to
have
access
to
those
premises.
and
in
that
connection,
your
honor,
i
do
want
to
talk
at
this
moment
in
connection
with
the
argument
that
these
outside
organizers,
if
they
are
permitted
to
go
on
the
plant
parking
lot,
they
are,
in
a
sense,
trespassers,
unlike
the
employees
who
are
already
there.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
might
well
be
said
of
union
organizers
who
seek
to
reach
employees
in
a
plant
park
--
who
seek
to
reach
employees
in
a
lumber
camp
or
in
a
mining
camp
where
they
both
work
and
live
that
they
too
are
--
are
trespassers
and
yet,
i
think,
we
are
all
agree.
in
fact,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
think,
foreshadow
this
conclusion
that
those
outside
organizers
would
be
entitled
to
have
access
to
those
employees
at
the
--
in
these
lumber
camps
because,
otherwise,
the
employees'
right
to
exercise
their
rights
under
their
statute,
the
employees'
right
to
be
informed
concerning
their
rights
would
be
seriously
handicap.
and
the
test,
we
think,
is,
we
apply
in
these
cases,
is
the
test
which
the
sixth
circuit
laid
down
in
that
lake
superior
case
and
that
is
whether
--
then
that
is,
what
in
fact
would
be
the
prejudice
to
the
interest
of
the
employer
and
permitting
access
and
what
would
be
the
benefit
to
the
employees.
and
whether
the
benefit
prevailed
over
the
prejudice
or
the
prejudice
prevailed
over
the
benefit.
now,
here
as
i
sought
to
indicate
yesterday,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
detriment
which
the
employer
suffers,
if
these
organizers
distribute
literature
on
the
plant
parking
lot
hardly
arises
to
more
than
the
mere
inconvenience
which
this
court
said
in
the
--
hardly
arises
to
anymore
than
the
kind
of
inconvenience
that
this
court
said
he
could
be
subjected
to
in
the
letourneau
case.
on
the
other
hand,
the
detriment
to
the
employees
is
particularly
serious.
and
it's
particularly
--
it's
even
more
serious
when
they
are
denied
access
to
these
outside
organizers
than
to
what
might
be
the
case
if
they
were
denied
communication
as
among
themselves
because
these
trained
organizers
as
we
know
are
specialists.
they
are
trained
in
this
kind
of
work.
they
are
frequently
the
employee's
best
sources
of
information
with
the
respect
to
this
union
matters
and
to
the
extent
that
an
employer
unreasonably
forecloses
otherwise
appropriate
avenues
of
communication
and
thereby
forecloses
the
employees
from
tapping
the
experience
and
the
organizational
know-how
of
these
experts
to
that
extent,
the
employers'
rights
are
diminished.
the
argument
is
also
advanced.
i
think
mr.
mueller
will
undoubtedly
make
it
and
i'd
like
to
anticipate
it
now.
the
argument
is
also
advanced
that
here,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
next
case,
that
there
was
no
prohibition
against
the
employees
themselves
distributing
the
literature.
and
that
the
union
organizers
could
have
handed
out
the
literature
to
these
employees
who
in
turn
could
have
gone
onto
--
into
the
parking
lot
and
distribute
the
literature
to
their
fellow
employees
in
the
parking
lot
and
thereby
have
this
information
available
to
the
employees.
our
answer
to
that
contention,
your
honor,
is,
if
the
court
please,
our
--
our
answer
to
that
is
that
these
trained
organizers
that
i
said
a
moment
ago
are
the
best
sources
of
information
for
the
employees.
and
when
that
literature
is
distributed,
undoubted
the
literature,
will
often
evoke
questions
from
the
employees.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
unless
the
answers
are
readily
forthcoming
at
the
times
the
literature
is
distributed
that
the
effectiveness
of
the
literature
will
be
largely
dissipated.
in
addition
to
that,
it
is
not
always
easy
to
obtain
employees
to
distribute
literature,
particularly
in
the
initial
stages
of
an
organizational
campaign.
understandably,
the
employees
might
be
reluctant
to
appear
in
the
role
of
spearheading,
an
organizational
campaign.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
feel
that
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
these
organizers
could
have
handed
the
literature
to
the
employees
themselves
who
in
turn
could
have
distributed
the
literature
to
their
fellow
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
the
stowe
case,
of
course,
went
off
on
the
ground
of
discrimination.
it
didn't
reach
the
problem
of
what
the
result
would
have
been
if
there
had
been
no
discrimination.
and,
of
course,
here
in
this
--
in
these
cases
just
as
in
the
letourneau,
there
is
no
claim
that
the
rule
is
a
discriminatory
rule.
in
other
words,
that
it
was
intended
to
prejudice
the
union
in
the
sense
that
an
employer,
say,
discharging
employees
or
punishing
them
for
engaging
union
activity.
the
rule
is
not
motivated
by
discriminatory
purpose.
that
--
the
--
the
stowe
case
is
significant,
i
think,
in
this
connection
just
as
the
letourneau
cases
and
also
the
marsh
verus
alabama
case,
which
involved
the
distribution
of
literature
by
the
jehovah
witnesses
in
a
company
own
town.
it
is
significant
in
this
sense.
as
the
court
said
there
that
the
employer's
mere
dominion
or
mere
control
over
his
property
rights
is
not
necessarily
decisive
or
controlling
of
the
issue
here.
in
stowe,
as
well
as
in
letourneau
and
as
well
as
in
marsh
versus
alabama,
the
court
said
that
the
protection
to
be
accorded
to
statutory
rights,
not
unlike
the
protection
to
be
accorded
to
constitutional
rights,
may
appropriately
require
the
subordination
of
the
employer's
naked
proprietary
interest
to
the
effective
exercise
of
those
rights.
thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
would
be
largely
repeating
myself,
i
think,
if
i
took
much
time
in
this
case,
but
i
do
want
to
call
attention
to
one
item.
there's
been
a
challenge
here
to
the
board's
finding
as
to
the
difficulty
of
distributing
literature
and
the
plant
area
here
at
gates
--
at
the
gates
--
at
the
gates.
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
and
the
court
below
agreed
with
the
board
on
--
that
on
these
facts,
and
i
will
not
attempt
to
detail
them
now,
that
on
these
facts
the
distribution
of
the
literature
at
that
place
was
quite
hazardous
and
very
dangerous.
now,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
have
nothing
more
to
add.
well,
i
have
already
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
distribution
there
is
always
some
incidental
talk
that
--
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
would
think
that
that
would
be
included
within
the
--
within
the
order,
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
it
is
not.
sometimes
the
board
has
phrased
the
order
--
framed
the
order
as
it
did
in
the
seamprufe
case,
the
second
case,
to
permit
the
organizers
to
distribute
literature
and
to
solicit
--
solicit
membership.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
--
well,
yes,
something
like
that.
that
was
not,
of
course,
on
a
company
property
in
terms
of
its
kinds.
but
i
think
that
the
solicitation
of
union
memberships
would
probably
regarded
as
included
within
the
order
which
permits
the
distribution
of
literature.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
believe
we've
had
another
case
that
i
recall,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
the
facts
clearly
in
mind
but
as
i
remember
the
--
in
that
case,
the
employer
furnished
money
for
the
printing
of
some
literature
which
either
favored
or
disfavored
the
union,
i
forgot
which.
and
in
that
case,
the
board
found
that
that
was
unlawful
support
but
the
sixth
circuit
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
the
sixth
circuit
disagreed
with
us
on
that.
i
haven't
look
into
the
particular
facts
that
relate
to
this
particular
allegation
in
this
case
or
--
the
only
thing
that
i
know
is
that
the
board
dismissed
the
complaint
except
for
the
respect
to
the
allegation
that
the
company
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
--
that
finding,
your
honor,
as
i
recall
it
did
not
relate
to
the
distribution
of
literature
by
these
organizers.
there,
they
find
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
that
some
extended
depends
upon
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case.
here,
apparently
the
court
--
the
board
thought
that
this
matter
was
protected
by
section
8
(c).
i
haven't
studied
the
point
so
that
i
don't
know
just
how
they
reconcile
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
with
the
other
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sorry.
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
solicitation,
your
honor,
frequently
goes
along
with
a
distribution
of
literature
or
vice
versa.i
think
that
there
really
is
no
--
no
more
serious
burden
to
one
hand
than
in
the
other
because
other
than
the
possibility
of
littering
whether
there's
distribution
of
literature.
but
the
board's
rule
permits
the
employer
to
the
safeguard
against
that.
i
don't
know
that
i
have
gotten
your
honors
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
question
there.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
thought,
your
honor,
that
the
order
contemplates
that
the
union
could
turn
the
parking
lot
into
a
union
hall
so
to
speak.
i
think
that
the
kind
of
solicitation
that
the
board
--
that
the
order
might
contemplate
would
be
simply
going
to
an
employee
and
discussing
very
briefly
with
him
whether
he
would
want
to
join
the
union
or
not
join
the
union
rather
in
conducting
open-air
meetings
and
speeches
on
the
--
on
the
plant
parking
lot.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that
might
well
arise,
of
course,
and
then
the
matter,
if
he
was
charged
that
the
employer
was
violating
the
order,
the
matter
would
come
to
the
board
and
then,
of
course,
there
would
be
a
determination
of
that
matter
by
the
board
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
whatever
rules
the
employer
had
adopted
to
forbid
that
sort
of
thing
were
included
within
the
reservation
that
the
employer
could
adopt
reasonable
and
nondiscriminatory
rules
in
the
interest
of
plant
efficiency
and
production.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
order,
as
i
mentioned
before,
does
not
go
quite
that
far,
although
i
think,
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
reed,
that
i
think
that
upon
solicitation,
it
would
probably
be
thought
by
the
board
to
be
included
within
the
permission
which
his
employers
to
give
to
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
i
must
express
myself
as
being
a
little
bit
shocked
because
i
--
i
argued
this
case
in
the
circuit
--
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
mr.
bernard
in
this,
who
was
the
lawyer
for
the
board
who
tried
the
case,
argued
the
case
against
me
and
judge
john
martin
interrupted
me
when
i
was
discussing
the
attack
upon
the
board's
brief
about
this
opportunity
for
discussion
and
he
said,
"mr.
schwartz,
you
can
be
assured
that
if
this
court
should
enforce
the
order,
it's
enforcing
the
order
as
written
and
not
the
board's
brief."
but
now,
i
find
that
the
board
indicates
to
us
in
argument
here
that
they
would
interpret
their
order
which
says
one
thing
reasonably
to
include
something
else.
and
as
this
court
said,
the
majority
opinion
in
stowe
spinning
company,
when
we
have
an
injunction
or
to
let
us
have
an
order
that
says
what
it
means,
that
tells
the
employer
what
it
is
going
to
do
not
to
come
to
its
adversary
a
year
later
or
six
months
later
and
say,
"what
happened?
how
are
we
going
to
interpret
this
order?"
that
is
an
unusual
proceeding
when
basically
you
go
to
your
adversary
and
say,
"how
are
you
going
to
interpret
this
injunction
against
us?"
in
the
court
--
in
the
court
below,
i
think,
the
court
missed
the
point
that
i
made
about
opportunity
for
discussion.
the
point
that
i
attempted
to
make
there
when
i
was
cutoff
by
judge
martin
and
i'm
not
critical
of
him
because
the
court
always
has
that
right,
maybe
i
hadn't
made
myself
clear
up
to
that
point.
and
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
that
the
argument
by
the
board
about
opportunity
for
discussion
shows
that
the
real
basis
for
the
board's
order
was
not
the
difficulty
or
the
impossibility
of
distributing
literature
but
the
convenience
and
the
opportunity
of
solicitation
and
of
arguments
and
so
forth.
now,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
black,
i
happened
to
be
familiar
with
that
cleveland
trust
case,
i
don't
know
whether
--
whether
you'd
be
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
happened
to
be
familiar
with
that
cleveland
trust
case
and
you
made
an
inquiry
about
paragraph
7
of
the
complaint.
would
you
like
to
have
me
enlighten
you
a
little
a
bit
on
that?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right.
it
isn't
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
all
understand
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
i
may
then,
if
the
chief
justice
will
permit,
it
might
take
a
moment
longer.
in
the
cleveland
trust
case,
and
that
is
decided
by
the
sixth
circuit,
the
employees
came
to
the
employer,
these
are
the
findings
of
the
board
and
we're
objecting
to
certain
statements
made
by
a
union.
i
forgot
what
union
it
was,
it
isn't
important,
and
they
made
inquiry
and
they
made
request
of
the
employer,
these
were
bank
clerks,
tellers,
guards
and
so
forth,
and
said
they
would
like
to
put
out
some
opposing
literature.
they
just
didn't
have
any
money.
the
company
very
frankly
and
openly
posted
a
notice
or
wrote
a
letter
to
the
employees
and
said,
"a
group
of
you
have
come
to
us
and
have
asked
whether
we
would
lend
our
printing
facilities
because
it's
a
large
bank,"
and
they
have
printing
facilities
to
permit
them
to
answer
some
of
the
statements
that
are
being
made
upon
them
because
as
i
think
your
honor
will
know
by
this
time,
very
frequently,
an
organizational
--
may
i
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
an
organizational
campaign
resolves
itself
not
into
an
attack
upon
the
employer
but
an
attack
upon
those
who
are
exercising
the
right
which
the
act
says
they
have
to
refrain
from
joining
the
cio
or
the
afl
of
the
case
maybe.
the
board
found
that
that
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
trial
examiner
found
by
citing
cleveland
trust
company
that
in
this
case
we
had
also
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
had
fairly
comparable
facts.
while
the
case
is
printing
before
the
board,
the
sixth
circuit
reversed.
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
the
board
order
in
the
cleveland
trust
case,
whereupon,
we
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum,
that's
referred
to
in
the
board
decision,
but
the
board
didn't
rely
on
the
cleveland
trust
company
decision.
the
board
said
in
this
particular
case
and
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
expenditure,
the
open
and
avowed
and
publicized
expenditure
of
$186
by
ranco
to
print
this
literature,
we
find
it
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
regardless
of
the
cleveland
trust
case.
in
other
words,
they
held
it
independently
and
this
is
the
first
as
i
know
of
where
they
so
held.
and
i
might
mention
just
to
complete
this
thought
that
by
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that's
correct.
i
thought
you
were
just
interested
in
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
i
think
it's
unfortunate
when
some
of
these
things
are
printed
up
for
the
--
for
the
court
below
that
they
take
the
color
out
of
a
case
because
these
circulars,
these
yellow
one,
red
and
green
circulars
with
cartoons
when
the
cartoon
is
reduce
to
a
small
type
cartoon
of
a
wolf
in
man's
clothing,
that
some
of
the
personal
attacks
made
upon
some
of
these
employees
were
of
such
nature
that
we
almost
had
to
restrain
our
employees
from
going
outside
our
plant
to
get
into
fist
fights
with
those
--
those
full
time
specialists
who
had
drafted
them,
which
incidentally
might
give
you
another
thought
about
the
tort
liability
and
the
trespasser
--
trespasser
or
invitee
for
government
order.
thank
you.
