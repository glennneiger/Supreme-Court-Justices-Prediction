mr.
o.
b.
fisher
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
manoli
here
--
i
couldn't
expect
to
know
how
to
make
an
argument
in
this
court,
when
this
is
the
first
time
and
it's
been
my
privilege
to
appear
in
this
court.
the
first
natural
impulse
when
(inaudible)
what
my
opponent
say
was
to
refer
to
the
fifth
amendment.
that
was
done.
intricacies
and
various
considerations
were
given
some
time.
and
then
it
was
decided
that
probably
this
court
would
dispose
of
this
case
without
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment.
however,
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
involved.
next,
not
knowing
how
to
present
this
case
in
this
court,
i
attempted
to
contemplate
the
--
or
recognize
the
position
of
the
board
as
taken
from
its
brief.
and
then
attempted
to
think
of
--
of
what
would
be
said.
that
doesn't
fit
either
at
--
at
this
time.
so,
even
at
the
risk
of
taking
too
much
of
my
time,
i
do
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
some
things
about
the
facts
that
are
before
the
court,
some
things
in
particular
and
then
in
general.
now,
first,
i
would
like
to
mention
that
the
argument
has
been
made
to
this
court
that
these
employees
a
mile
out
from
this
country
town
of
paris,
texas
i
don't
know
just
how
much
judicial
knowledge
the
court
takes,
the
record
shows
that
it
is
of
town
of
21,000
people.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
it's
a
county
seat
town
and
a
county
seat
lawyer
is
addressing
you
which
probably
account
for
wanting
(inaudible)
by
the
fifth
amendment
instead
of
the
labor
law,
having
engaged
in
general
practice
and
not
a
specialized
practice.
and
it's
mentioned
in
the
--
the
brief
of
the
board
in
this
case
that
--
that
is,
the
facts
are
stated
in
a
negative
way,
so
to
speak,
and
this
plant
is
one
mile
from
the
corporate
limits,
that's
true.
the
record
may
show
its
several
miles
from
the
center
of
town,
if
though
i
will
want
to
give
the
chamber
of
commerce
that
information.
but
it's
unimportant
of
the
question
has
been
asked
with
reference
to
what
was
the
situation
around
this
plant.
the
court
showed
an
interest
in
just
what
the
situation
was.
and
mr.
manoli
correctly
told
the
court
that
property
just
across
the
road
was
vacant
property.
that
it
was
probably
available
to
anybody
and
for
any
lawful
use.
that
addition
by
me,
of
course.
he
only
stated
correctly
that
there
was
a
vacant
property
across
the
road.
this
plant
is,
it
is
out
in
the
country,
it's
three
quarters
of
a
mile
to
the
first
road
leaving
the
farmed
market
road
on
which
the
plant
is
situated
that
is
traversing
it
east
and
west
when
you
travel
north
from
the
plant.
such
is
the
findings
in
the
record.
it's
some
two
or
three
miles
south
of
the
plant
before
a
road
is
reached
leading
east,
either
or
west
from
the
side
of
the
plant.
now,
it's
been
stated
that
the
employees
leaving
that
plant
normally
drive
direct
home,
directly
home
without
stopping.
that
maybe
true.
if
there's
any
evidence
in
this
record
to
that
affect
it
passed
my
attention.
i
just
did
--
it
just
as
did
the
evidence
in
the
record
which
is
brought
out
in
the
brief
of
the
board
in
this
case
or
(inaudible)
that
this
company
policy
or
company
rule
not
only
applies
to
union
organizers
and
outsiders
but
it's
made
to
apply
to
their
own
employees.
i
didn't
remember
that
until
it
was
noted
and
then
i
do
find
that
representative
of
the
company
on
the
witness
stand
was
asked
of
the
trial
examiner
or
of
the
counsel
for
general
counsel.
is
it
not
a
fact
that
you
would
object
under
your
company
policy
to
permitting
the
employees
to
drive
to
the
--
to
the
distribute
literature
on
a
parking
lot
because
it
would
litter
it
up.
and
he
gave
an
affirmative
answer.
that
was
something
insignificant.
in
this
case
until
it
reached
the
--
the
appellate
court
and
this
court.
it
had
no
significant
in
the
sense
of
time.
if
the
evidence
shows
that
those
employees
drive
directly
home
from
the
plant
why,
it
was
insignificant
at
the
time
and
it
still
insignificant.
the
union
has
accessibility
or
has
access
rather
to
the
employees
of
this
babcock
&
wilcox
plant
at
paris,
texas
on
the
streets,
in
their
homes,
at
meeting
halls
and
at
all
the
other
places
that
are
normally
found
in
a
county
seat
town
of
21,000
people.
likewise,
they
have
all
the
area
between
the
plant
and
paris,
texas
and
all
of
the
area
south
and
east
and
west
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
employees
if
they
should
really
and
energetically
desire
to
do
so.
the
record
shows
that
the
plant
is
situated
in
a
farming
and
grazing
community.
the
land
is
either
in
cultivation
or
it
is
in
pasture
land..
so,
all
of
that
space
around
this
approximately
100
acres
that
is
occupied
for
this
plant
is
just
as
available
to
the
union
as
it
is
to
any
other
individual.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
union
did
reach
the
employees
right
at
the
plant
gate
and
in
mentioning
that
we
certainly
do
not
want
to
admit
to
this
court
--
admit
to
this
court
that
we
agree
with
the
contention
that
it's
necessary
to
carry
out
for
the
purposes
of
the
law
that
the
organizers
be
able
to
meet
with
and
see
and
discuss
matters
with
the
employees
right
at
the
company
gate
or
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant
if
such
is
true.
nevertheless,
they
did
see
them
there
on
three
occasions.
there
were
at
that
time
approximately
500
employees.
on
one
occasion
they
delivered
literature
to
325
of
the
500
are
to
--
are
delivered
250
pieces
of
literature
to
345.
on
another
occasion
they
delivered
a
lesser
number
of
pieces
of
literature
up
to
250.
and
on
another
occasion
some
different
number
all
of
which
is
set
out
in
the
brief
in
this
case.
now,
they
were
able
to
reach
the
employees
in
the
immediate
vicinity
with
the
plant,
but
we
don't
want
to
capitalize
that
if
you
please.
of
course,
our
position
is
that
the
maternal
case
is
not
a
kin
to
the
case
that's
now
before
this
court
that
it's
different,
a
proposition
all
together
as
has
been
indicated.
mr.
manoli,
has
said
now
that
the
board
does
not
consider
this
case
different
from
the
letourneau
case.
such
is
the
sense
of
the
brief
of
the
board
when
it's
taken
as
a
whole.
so
that
seems
to
be
issue
on
number
one
maybe
that
before
this
court
at
this
time.
if
it
is
we
think
we
are
prepared
and
we
think
we
have
demonstrated
that
we
are
prepared
to
show
the
difference
between
this
case
and
letourneau
case.
it
has
been
mentioned
in
colloquially
with
mr.
manoli.
first,
there
is
an
outside
organizer
not
only
involved
here,
there
you
were
dealing
with
the
employees
of
the
plant
in
paris,
texas
and
as
we
understand
property
rights,
we
look
upon
those
employees
not
only
as
being
employees,
but
they
are
persons
at
the
plant,
there
are
licensees
there.
they
are
there
to
do
their
work
and
the
fact
that
they
are
there
working
doesn't
mean
that
they
will
cease
breathing.
they've
ceased
eating,
they
ceased
any
usual
activity
of
life
and
nor
does
it
mean
that
they
will
lose
all
their
interest
in
citizenship
when
they
go
to
work
there.
therefore,
we
go
along
with
the
idea
that
no
restriction
should
be
put
upon
their
activity
in
the
plant
regardless
of
what
it
is,
unless
it
interferes
with
production
or
discipline
within
the
plant.
there
is
nothing
like
that
in
this
law
suit.
we
are
simply
dealing
with
the
question
that
i
think
is
fairly
and
squarely
presented
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
and
that
is
whether
or
not
on
outside
organizer
shall
be
accorded
or
permitted
to
go
on
to
the
premises.
my
authority,
not
of
any
constitutional
right
but
by
authority
of
the
decision
in
the
letourneau
case.
that
is
what
the
board
seems
to
base
its
position
upon
here,
now.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
board
has
misconstrued
and
misapplied
of
what
this
honorable
court
intended
by
the
letourneau
decision.
it's
been
said
in
oral
argument
here
that
not
--
that
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
plant
as
stated
in
the
brief
of
the
board
is
the
most
appropriate
and
the
most
desirable
place
to
distribute
union
literature.
but
now,
it's
carried
one
step
further
and
is
argued
that
the
plant
area
itself
is
the
most
appropriate
place.
and
it's
also
mentioned
that
in
many
instances
the
union
organizers
have
difficulty
in
communicating
with
employees
because
they
don't
have
their
names.
that's
not
this
case
now
before
this
court.
the
evidence
shows
and
the
record
shows
that
the
union
had
communication
with
the
employees.
that
it
wrote
letters
to
the
tune
of
100
or
more
on
different
occasions
to
the
employees
of
the
company
at
page
36
of
the
brief
for
respondent,
i
believe.
the
facts
in
this
case
when
brought
to
a
quick
conclusion
are
that
the
union
organizer
sought
to
avoid
going
to
the
homes
of
people,
avoid
or
sought
to
avoid
seeing
them
on
the
streets,
sought
to
avoid
going
to
probably
call
him
on
the
telephone
and
sought
to
avoid
writing
them
letters
or
by
seeing
him
at
the
gate
of
the
plant.
now,
then
after
that
was
done
and
a
congestion
resulted
there
being
a
public
area
between
the
plant
property
and
the
travel
portion
of
highway.
and
after
a
letter
had
been
written
which
is
here
say
insofar
as
we're
concerned
telling
the
union
that
it
was
dangerous
to
distribute
literature
there
he
terminated
such
activity.
this
case,
this
matter
in
this
case
received
very
little
attention
at
the
outset.
this
respondent
was
charged
with
16
separate
ungrounded
violations
of
law,
so
to
speak
or
acts
of
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board
determined
that
it
was
not
guilty
of
any
of
the
15.
this
was
the
16th
and
the
last
and
it
determined
that
it
was
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
it
did
not
give
permission
to
the
union
to
distribute
a
literature
upon
its
premises.
there
is
no
question,
--
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
thank
you,
sir.
there
--
there
is
no
serious
question
of
inaccessibility
in
this
case.or
there
is
no
question
of
discrimination.
the
--
there's
no
history
of
unfair
labor
practices.
there
is
no
history
of
any
anti-union
campaign
by
the
company.
the
company,
under
this
record,
and
under
the
findings
has
occupied
a
hands-off
policy.
it
was
charged
with
surveillance.
it
was
charged
with
interrogation
of
employees
and
those
charges
were
dismissed
by
the
board.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
i'll
tell
you
anything
i
know,
sir.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
it
certain
--
it
certainly
is,
sir.
yes.
oh,
i'm
glad
to
respond
to
that
question
in
--
in
my
way
which
will
certainly
not
be
in
any
technical
fashion,
i
fear.
as
a
country
lawyer,
my
interest
in
this
case
is
protecting
of
what
i
consider
a
valuable
right
and
the
necessary
element
of
freedom
and
democracy.
if
we
do
not
have
the
right
to
own
and
control
property
subject
to
reasonable
regulations,
why,
then
we
have
lost
a
lot
of
our
citizens
here,
a
lot
of
that
that
inspires
or
impels
us
to
get
up
at
morning
and
go
to
work
and
to
work
late
at
night.
we
have
lost
a
lot
of
what
it
takes
to
energetically
going
about
doing
things.
that
would
be
number
one
maybe.
number
two,
because
i
do
not
think
that
it's
fair
to
call
upon
one
man
whether
it
be
babcock
&
wilcox's
company
with
a
country
plant
out
in
texas
or
whether
it
be
an
individual
to
furnish
his
facilities
and
his
property
to
some
other
person
or
some
group
of
persons
to
operate
on.
and
that
does
what
this
sort
of
thing
would
lead
to,
if
we
are
compelled,
not
we,
but
i
mean,
if
the
company
is
compelled
by
the
board
to
let
this
group
men
in.
certainly,
the
company
will
be
compelled
to
let
another
group
in.
and
certainly
then
we
will
be
furnishing
an
arena
for
the
operation
of
two
or
more
unions
probably,
with
follow
up
that
you
have
the
sanction
and
disturbances
among
the
employees.
the
reason
i
am
here,
is
because
i
think,
a
happy
situation
exists
down
there
at
this
time,
i
fear
that
an
unhappy
situation
will
exist
if
we
do
not
sustain
this
court
of
civil
appeals
in
this
action
that
refused
to
enforce
this
order.
i
think
it's
a
human
right
as
well
that
we're
defending
and
i'm
glad
to
have
come
here
for
that
purpose
even
though
there
--
there's
nothing
involved
except
just
whether
a
man
goes
on
there
and
hands
out
some
papers.
i'm
not
concerned
about
the
littering
we
read
about
perticular
but
we
can
clean
that
up.
but
there's
no
way
we
can
regain
that
right
we
have
lost
if
the
property
is
taken
away
from
us
without
due
process
of
law
or
without
just
compensation.
i
thought
it
would
be
if
--
if
that
parking
lot
is
to
be
dedicated
to
an
arena
for
union
activity
and
if
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
should
desire
to
furnish
that
arena,
then
we
should
enter
a
condemnation
proceeding
against
my
client.
take
the
property
and
compensate
the
--
the
client
for
it
and
invite
the
union
representative
and
the
employees
there.
but
we
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
(inaudible)
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
that'd
be
fine
or
if
we
are
dispose
to
why,
so
if
the
government
wants
to
rent
one
for
them,
that's
all
--
that's
all
right,
too.
we'll
furnish
a
town
hall.
there
are
town
halls
(inaudible)
in
paris.
it
may
not
be
in
the
record.
i
don't
want
to
get
out
of
the
record,
but
we
have
everything
with
a
town
that
size
has.
and
there
are
plenty
of
places
to
meet,
your
honor
and
mr.
justice
minton.
and
we
just
don't
feel
obligated
to
permit
these
people
to
come
in
there
on
a
profit/loss
company.
we're
not
going
to
do
it
until
this
honorable
court
tells
us
we
must
do
it.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
what
i
know
--
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
yes,
sir.
that
there
are
others,
mr
justice
black.
i
don't
know
what
the
consequence
would
be.
i
know
what
the
--
the
relationship
is
between
an
invitee
or
a
licensee
or
a
grantor
or
an
employer,
but
just
what
is
the
relationship
between
this
plant
ownership
and
the
union
organizer
if
this
court
should
require
that
the
company
is
permitting
to
come
in
there?
he's
a
licensee
of
the
board
or
of
the
court.
he's
coming
in
there,
i
don't
know
what
the
company
liability
would
to
him.
i
don't
know
how
much
duty
to
protect
him
we'd
have.
i
don't
know
whether
he
if
he
stumbled
on
a
railing
and
broke
his
leg,
we'd
be
liable
in
damages.
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
yes,
sir.
there
are
some,
very
well
(inaudible)
mr.
o.
b.
fisher
yes,
i
think
they'll
--
i'll
think
they'll
show
me.
they're
all
in
the
map.
if
he
stumbled
over
that
why,
i
don't
know
what
the
company
liability
would
be
but
just
this
sort
of
thing
leads
to
so
many
things
that
i
think
at
this
moment
before
this
court
comprehend
even
a
small
part
of
them.
because
i
--
i
may
not
be
thinking
now
just
like
i
think
in
(inaudible)
texas
and
under
these
circumstances.
but
we
do
want
to
urge
our
position
upon
the
court
and
i
have
to
outline
here
what
i
want
to
say
and
haven't
said
any
of
it.[laughter]
first
of
all
i
want
to
make
it
brief.
first
is
i
gave
you
the
facts.
i
haven't
done
all
of
that
but
i've
given
you
part
of
them.
they're
in
the
brief
and
in
the
record.
the
board's
position
is
to
stand
in
old
letournea
as
far
as
i
am
concerned.
our
position
is
that
letourneau
doesn't
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
board
is
now
urging.
that
strangers
are
not
involved
in
letourneau
but
they
are
here.
and
that
even
if
--
if
letourneau,
if
all
of
the
reasoning
in
letourneau
applied
why,
it
wouldn't
mean
that
this
order
of
this
board
should
be
enforced.
if
this
order
is
enforced
it
will
be
an
extension
of
the
letourneau
reasoning
that
we
fear
will
later
result
in
disturbance
and
affecting
of
affecting
of
people,
employees
and
persons
who
were
not
employees,
whether
they'd
be
owners
of
farms
or
owners
of
homes
in
the
community
where
this
plant
is
located.
i
don't
believe
there
are
people.
and
i'm
not
talking
about
my
client,
the
company,
but
our
people
would
understand
just
why
it
was
that
the
law
would
require
a
man
to
open
his
farm,
his
backyard
or
his
front
porch
to
a
stranger.
all
of
such
claims
they're
reasoning,
how
it's
offered
here.
that
is
that,
the
union
cannot
readily,
if
the
court
please,
just
cannot
readily,
that's
the
most
defining
amount
and
if
they
cannot
readily
communicate
with
the
employees
of
the
plant
property
and
that
is
expensive.
and
that
the
whole
extent
of
this
finding.
thank
you
for
listening
to
me.
