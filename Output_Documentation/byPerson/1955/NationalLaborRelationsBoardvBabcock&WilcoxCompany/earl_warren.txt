mr.
manoli,
isn't
there
a
marked
difference
between
the
distribution
of
literature
and
the
solicitation
of
membership
insofar
as
the
burden
passed
on
the
employer
as
his
property
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
this
that
it's
a
very
simple
matter
for
anyone
to
go
into
a
parking
lot
and
distribute
--
distribute
literature,
but
there
a
lot
of
implications
and
solicitation
of
membership.
that
might
mean
the
right
to
make
a
speech
to
the
employees.
it
might
be
that
the
right
to
--
to
gather
them
together
for
that
purpose
and
--
and
the
one
might
not
--
might
not
interfere
at
all
with
the
efficiency
of
the
plant
or
the
order
or
the
operation
of
it
that
the
other
might
and
many
circumstances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
have
any
doubt
of
what
some
people
would
interpret
that
right
of
solicitation
could
mean
they
have
a
right
to
make
a
speech
and
can
be
use
the
premises
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
only
point
is
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
exactly
correct,
just
charge
of
a
refusal
to
let
--
let
them
distribute
literature
and
then
to
make
the
finding
that
they
must
go,
permit
them
to
distribute
literature
and
solicit
membership.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish.
