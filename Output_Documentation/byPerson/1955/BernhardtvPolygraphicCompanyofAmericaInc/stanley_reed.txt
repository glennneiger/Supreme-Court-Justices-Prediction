justice
stanley
reed
is
there
any
provision
with
regard
to
the
state
--
law
of
the
states
to
get
in
courts
justice
stanley
reed
in
other
words,
you
can't
make
a
provision
and
the
case
tried
in
vermont
that
it
shall
be
interpreted
by
the
laws
of
new
york.
justice
stanley
reed
(voice
overlap)
you
can.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i'm
not
enforcing
those.
justice
stanley
reed
in
all
cases
are
only
where
the
new
york
contract
is
to
a
contrary
to
good
morals
and
public
policy
in
vermont.
justice
stanley
reed
if
the
laws
of
vermont's
and
new
york
differ,
you
must
follow
the
law
of
the
vermont
in
vermont.
justice
stanley
reed
and
in
this
procedure?
justice
stanley
reed
before
you
--
before
you
--
may
i
interrupt
this
to
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
ask
you
questions,
please.
it
--
does
it
show
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
withdrew
from
his
agreement
to
arbitrate?
justice
stanley
reed
the
record
show?
justice
stanley
reed
does
the
record
show?
justice
stanley
reed
do
you
take
that
that's
a
withdraw?
justice
stanley
reed
would
it
be
necessary
for
them
to
withdraw
to
raise
the
question
for
this
case?
justice
stanley
reed
it
began
arbitration?
justice
stanley
reed
in
your
time
that
is
here.
justice
stanley
reed
if
arbitration
took
place
--
it
would
take
place
in
new
york?
justice
stanley
reed
but
not
in
vermont?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
do
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case
what
state
law
controls?
justice
stanley
reed
what
--
what
would
happen,
mr.
ehrich,
if
this
court
affirmed
this.
you
would
then
go
before
the
new
york
arbitration,
i
suppose.
justice
stanley
reed
and
there,
you
would
have
the
right
to
withdraw
from
the
arbitration
under
your
theory?
justice
stanley
reed
no,
no.
they
didn't
merely
decide
that
in
accordance
with
article
--
paragraph
3,
isn't
it?
article
iii,
that
there'd
be
a
stay
and
that
you
would
have
to
undertake
the
arbitration
(voice

--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
you
--
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
didn't
say
ignore
it.
i
said
if
we
affirm
this,
you
would
have
to
appear
before
the
new
york
arbitration
commission.
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
so
if
you
appear
there,
then
wouldn't
you
have
the
right
to
raise
every
question
in
regard
to
the
--
to
the
law
of
vermont
that
you
now
or
before
the
law
has
--
had
a
right
to
withdraw
from
the
arbitration
since
they
didn't
know
the
decision?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
even
though
your
(voice
overlap)
have
said
in
--
in
answer
to
this
claim
for
arbitration,
we
announce
that
we
have
withdrawn
from
the
arbitration
agreement
in
accordance
to
the
law
of
vermont.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
that
--
that's
the
very
question
you
have
before
the
district
court,
isn't
it?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
the
cohen
case
said
that
we
didn't
have
to
apply
the
law
of
new
jersey,
one
of
suit,
the
stockholders
liability
as
i
recall
it.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
the
one
of
the
federal
court.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
as
i
understand
what
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter,
vermont
would
be
able
to
say
no
agreement
of
another
state
would
be
enforced
in
vermont.
justice
stanley
reed
no
agreements
made
in
another
state
would
be
enforced
in
vermont.
justice
stanley
reed
only
arbitration?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
i
think
you
say
that
about
an
arbitration
agreement,
why
not
about
any
agreement?
justice
stanley
reed
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
a
question
of
whether
it's
so
violative
in
the
policy
of
vermont
that
is
a
matter
almost
(inaudible)
justice
stanley
reed
i
understand
that.
justice
stanley
reed
so
even
if
he
waives
it
--
justice
stanley
reed
even
if
he
waives
it
and
then
changes
his
mind.
justice
stanley
reed
so
no
matter
what
he
contracts
to
do,
he
could
still
get
his
jury
if
he
wants
to.
justice
stanley
reed
no
dispute
about
service?
justice
stanley
reed
you
served
in
new
york?
justice
stanley
reed
now,
wait
a
minute.
may
i
ask
right
there
if
it
wouldn't
interrupt
you.
it
was
suggested
by
your
opponent
that
the
vermont
law
on
arbitration
was
clear
that
one
might
withdraw
anytime
that
he
please
from
an
arbitration
agreement.
justice
stanley
reed
well,
if
we
left
the
whole
problem
of
arbitration
for
a
moment
and
thought
of
what
the
law
in
vermont
was
as
to
the
interpretation
and
enforceability
of
contracts
made
in
another
states,
governed
by
the
law
of
the
other
states
according
to
the
language
of
contract,
then
were
drawn
in
vermont.
have
we
any
light
on
that?
justice
stanley
reed
but
the
--
the
lex
loci
is
there
--
there,
the
law
ordinarily
enforced
in
vermont?
justice
stanley
reed
have
you
--
have
you
discussed
that
question?
justice
stanley
reed
was
the
vermont
law
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stanley
reed
or
you
needed
the
rights
of
the
federal
statute?
justice
stanley
reed
the
vermont
law
was
before
the
district
court
was
it?
justice
stanley
reed
but
that
was
on
the
question,
was
is
not,
of
--
of
whether
--
whether
vermont
law
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
was
related
to
arbitration
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
and
not
whether
vermont
law
on
the
contract.
justice
stanley
reed
your
conflict
argument
going
to
be
--
justice
stanley
reed
won't
the
conflict
argument
be
the
determining
factor
in
this
case?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
he
goes
through.
i
--
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
went
the
other
way.
justice
stanley
reed
yes,
if
--
if
it
is
necessary
to
decide
the
vermont
law
in
order
to
keep
this
from
being
arbitrated
in
vermont,
it
was
necessary
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
it
contrary
as
to
vermont
law
for
it
to
go
to
stay
in
new
york
law.
