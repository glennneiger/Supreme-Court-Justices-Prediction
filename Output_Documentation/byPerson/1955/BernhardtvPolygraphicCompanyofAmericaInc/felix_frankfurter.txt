justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ehrich,
may
i,
ask
to
give
this
interruption
in
your
argument.
but
wouldn't
it
help
us
to
understand
that
would
lead
certainly
to
a
sketch,
would
indicate
what
the
course
of
the
litigation
would
be
if
this
were
allowed
to
remain
in
the
state
courts
or
what
the
course
of
litigation
and
how
depends
to
each
case
if
what
you
claim
is
--
is
--
the
respondent's
position
and
the
court's
position
if
it's
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
almost
doesn't
reach
in
the
truculent
to
find
out
whether
it
would
have
to,
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
haven't
removed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
all?
but
the
issues
will
be
determined
by
juries,
that
is
by
the
obligation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right
as
to
the
wide
view
of
the
--
well,
this
is
up
to
vermont
so
there's
no
conjecture.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
we
don't
(inaudible)
the
arbitration
included?
what
is
open
for
judicial
oversight
or
review
or
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
power
of
the
arbitrator
under
the
agreement,
what
issues
are
open
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
was
this
agreement
made
in
vermont?
justice
felix
frankfurter
executed
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
can
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
to
enable
--
tell
me
whether
--
what
the
new
york
law
is,
what
is
according
to
new
york
law
of
contracts.
the
contract
entered
into
new
york.
it
was
found
in
new
york.
if
i
turn,
the
enforcement
is
to
be
in
another
sense.
the
new
york
law
clear
as
to
--
according
to
it,
whether
the
law
for
making
him
a
contract
is
the
law
contrary
to
performance,
governance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
setting
out
the
provision
of
contracts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
just
say
the
result's
on
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
with
reference
to
the
specific
question
because
then,
henceforth,
it
all
--
from
my
point
of
view,
get
into
verbalism.
but
generally,
as
new
york
pronounce
on
whether
when
the
contract
is
made
between
two
people,
(inaudible)
or
anywhere
else
in
new
york
in
lawyer's
office,
contemplating
difficult
problems
in
another
state
exclusive
to
itself.
it
is
the
law
of
performance
in
the
other
states
to
determine
conditions
under
which
performance
can
be
had.
or
is
the
new
york
part
of
the
contract
basis?
or
has
new
york
pronounced
merely
on
this
subject
and
then
it
varies,
or
the
question
of
characterization
would
not
fall
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
make
a
difference,
they
make
a
difference
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all
the
--
the
federal
court
is
enforcing
some
kind
of
law,
maybe
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
both
new
york
and
vermont
agree
that
the
place
of
performance
governed,
then
you
may
have
different
considerations
in
--
in
other
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
we
have
to
decide
what
was
--
assuming
you're
right,
do
we
have
to
decide
what
vermont
law
is,
having
no
--
no
light
or
have
light
shed
on
it
from
any
of
the
courts
below?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
to
decide
the
question
i
put
to
you
before
noon?
do
we
have
to
decide
if
--
if
the
stay
become
relevant,
what
new
york
is
with
reference
to
a
contract
executed
in
new
york
but
the
legal
forum
is
vermont
without
any
light
from
the
lower
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
--
is
that
necessary
to
this
panel?
the
erie
doctrine
merely
means
that
relevant
state
law
and
not
some
concoction
of
the
federal
court
as
to
what
is
the
general
law,
applies.
but
that
doesn't
tell
me
what
the
relevant
state
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
may
--
they
may
not
be
but
assuming
it
is,
have
we
determined
--
do
we
know,
the
answer
eventually
does
or
an
adequate
certainty
what
vermont
law
is
on
this
subject?
all
--
all
we
know
is
that
vermont
law,
that
it
rules
out
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
this
is
--
this
--
this
is
a
new
york
--
all
these
went
to
that.
i
mean
hardly
stay
open
in
my
mind,
it
couldn't
be
more
open.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
new
york
--
if
this
is
a
new
york
conflict.
in
the
first
place,
it
maybe
a
question
of
new
york
law
as
to
whether
or
not
the
law
raise
the
performance
of
it.
in
the
second
place,
i
do
not
know,
why
should
i
know
what
vermont
law
is
as
to
a
contract
to
be
executed
in
vermont
but
--
to
be
performed
in
vermont
but
executed
in
new
york.
on
the
vermont
we
have
--
have
a
law
different
for
what
governing
body
as
to
a
conflict
of
contracts
which
is
made
and
is
formed
in
vermont.
in
relation
to
a
contract
tat
exists
is
made
in
new
york
with
complete
performance
in
vermont
and
new
york
that
has
a
law
as
to
contracts
made
in
new
york
to
be
performed
in
new
york
with
different
problems
from
contracts
made
in
new
york
to
be
performed
in
vermont.
any
one
of
those
possibilities
seem
to
me
relevant,
rationally
speaking,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
therefore
--
and
therefore,
the
question
is
where
do
i
get
the
answers
to
those.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
one
of
the
vermont
(inaudible)
to
go
through
--
then
go
through
vermont
cases
to
find
out?
one
would
get
lost
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
we
have
to
prophesize
to
what
vermont
law
would
be
if
it
came
before
the
vermont
supreme
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
prophesize
that
too
much
because
it's
a
matter
of
remedy,
you
are
next
going
to
argue
that
it
is
a
matter
of
remedy
once
it
gets
into
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
in
those
new
york
cases,
to
call
this
remedy
doesn't
help
too
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why.
we
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
just
--
if
i
understand
that,
if
i
understand
myself
whether
it's
remedy
or
the
substance
with
certain
aspect
is
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
enforcing,
giving
counsels
in
a
case
we
move
to
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
go
after
the
different
things.namely,
what
--
what
cloak
we
are
speaking,
substantially
makes
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
this
according
to
vermont
law
the
question
of
remedy,
is
it?
well,
the
common
law
would
make
it
remedy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
common
law
you
derive
from
the
new
york
cases
would
have
gone
back
when,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
think
if
it's
remedy
in
vermont
law,
it
isn't
true
under
the
guaranty
trust
company
to
every
question
of
remedy.
it
means
the
opposite
issues
that
every
question
of
remedy
of
the
state
is
enforced
by
the
federal
court,
i
mean
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
certain
purposes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
for
purposes
of
implementing
the
erie
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
so
--
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
that
remedy
is
the
most
treacherous
concept
to
be
using
in
this
particular
problem
because
you
have
to
say,
"yes,
remedy
for
service
purposes
would
not
without
that."
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
the
new
york
--
the
guarantee
trust
company
tried
to
indicate
that
it
gets
you
nowhere
in
those
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
we've
got
here.
we've
got
an
erie
purpose
here,
haven't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
question
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
that
--
on
that
belief
conflict
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
be
to
call
the
state
courts
to
say
i
couldn't
get
any
by
going
to
the
vermont
cases,
and
sending
to
the
new
york
cases
because
new
york
and
vermont,
both
the
common
law
jurisdiction
and
the
common
law
is
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
it
was,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
i
assume
--
assuming
you're
right
--
assuming
--
don't
worry
about
the
conflict
problems,
so
called,
and
that
a
situation
where
vermont
says,
"this
kind
of
--
this
question
vermont
thought
wouldn't
deal
remedy,"
we
can't
have
this
remedy
in
the
sort
of
jury
non-proper
prejudice.
and
we
come
to
our
federal
problem.
namely,
is
this
the
kind
of
thing
by
which
the
substantive
law
is
enforced
to
take
that
remedy
and
therefore,
the
federal
court
on
its
own,
(inaudible)
or
resource
to
the
remedy
or
must
have
take
over
from
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
this
to
you
in
view
of
that
consideration
of
yours.
for
purposes
of
argument,
suppose
the
question
had
come
up
in
the
reverse,
so
as
vermont
having
arbitration
law
allows
them
and
the
new
york
didn't.
now,
this
was
removed
to
the
new
york,
to
the
southern
district
of
new
york
where
the
calendar
has
been
what
denotes
to
them
as
you
have
been
in
--
in
some
considerable
extent
of
what
it
is.
would
--
would
the
consideration
that
you
advance
the
opposite
of
which
that
they
have
prevailed
irrelevant
to
be
--
in
this
matter
to
be
determined
by
state
of
the
calendar
for
one
thing,
is
that
relevant
continuation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
mean
--
my
question
doesn't
mean
to
decline
an
answer.
i
question
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
do
too.
it's
been
decided
as
the
(inaudible)
clause
by
which
dissent
from
court
opinions
are
all
the
same,
not
one
of
which
every
quarter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
best
way
to
satisfy
me
in
your
coherent
theory
to
be
something
that
certifies
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ehrich,
may
i
--
(inaudible)
case
that
that
was
a
surprise
about
that
decision.
the
statute
--
the
statute
changed
that
decision,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
seems
to
me
the
old
and
the
perfectly
(inaudible)
but
i
don't
think
it
has
written
that
opinion.
but
i
don't
see
that
--
i
get
any
light
on
that
from
--
for
our
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
talk
in
saying
that
arbitration
relates
to
remedy.
well,
the
point
of
that
case
is
that
new
york
disregarded
a
--
wouldn't
enforce
a
provision
we
challenge
to
the
court.
that
--
that's
the
heart
of
that
case
which
--
which
to
me
is
a
little
medieval.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
--
what
--
what
is
the
significance?
what's
the
importance
of
calling
it
a
matter
of
remedy?
i
don't
understand
it.
suppose
it
was
called
only
to
substantive
law
as
in
mitcham
and
reach
the
same
result,
wouldn't
they?
party
said
by
agreements
to
decide
by
what
substantive
law
contract
it
governed,
it
--
it
--
wouldn't
that
undo
it
for
purposes
to
decide
and
other
rights
should
be
enforced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
(voice
overlap)
the
corporation
as
to
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
the
new
york
--
derives
that,
is
that
the
new
york
law?
am
i
just
supposing
that
that's
the
new
york
law
that
it's
--
and
probably
more
important
to
decide
whether,
although
the
contract
was
made
in
new
york,
it
looks
the
performance
in
vermont
and
therefore,
we've
got
a
conflict
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
the
lawsuit
is
brought?
the
answer
to
what
the
court
does
where
the
lawsuit
is
brought,
the
public
attorney
on
what
side
of
his
rights
and
remedies
and
liabilities
to
be
enforced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
whole
point
--
one
of
the
advantages
--
what
is
--
what
--
what
are
the
advantages
of
one
of
the
intellectual
games
of
the
erie
doctrine
is
that
this
calls
for
reexamination
of
these
--
these
categories
that
has
been
thrown
around
until
they
solve
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
as
to
a
lot
of
things.
it
doesn't
have
to
apply
the
law
of
vermont
as
for
the
time
that
enactment
is
to
be
filed?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
ehrich,
suppose
--
i
hope
my
questions
really
indicate
to
beat
the
puzzling
problems
as
to
one
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
this
litigation,
both
are
reversed.
it
is
--
the
state
law
allowed
arbitration
and
even,
it
would
enforce
arbitration.
suppose
the
case
had
arisen
before
this
court
decided
that
arbitration
agreement
was
valid
or
the
red
start
to
limit
the
red
light.
and
arbitration
agreement
were
deemed
throughout
the
court
jurisdiction
and
not
enforced.
the
state
law
allows
the
arbitration.
cases
removed
to
the
federal
court.
federal
court
as
a
matter
of
substance,
as
a
matter
of
law
of
limitation,
there
is
no
arbitration.
we
cannot
give
arbitration,
that's
against
the
law
for
anybody
who's
far
ahead
as
this
case
had
(inaudible)
what
about
that
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
--
the
case
i
thought
that
where
the
federal
court
couldn't
(inaudible)
the
state
court
did.
and
you
say
it
makes
a
substantive
difference
in
the
result
whether
you
have
arbitration
or
not,
is
that
right?rather
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
only
--
have
conducting
business.
i'm
suggesting
that
in
that
case,
the
federal
court
would
have
to
say,
“we
have
to
--
the
case
is
properly
here,
the
court
has
jurisdiction.”
it
must
adjudicate.
as
a
provision
for
arbitration,
we
can't
enforce
that.
therefore,
withdraw
about
enforcing
it
as
the
way
we
do
business
the
same
way
before
a
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
of
conducting
its
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
would
have
to
grant
a
stay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
allow
arbitration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
a
federal
court
held
that
arbitration
by
--
later
that
we
courts
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
as
you
why
you
don't
shortly
or
briefly
answer
justice
minton's
question
by
saying
it
is
offensive
to
vermont?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
it
that's
the
policy
of
vermont,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it
isn't
then
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
vermont
says
we
gave
it
against
the
public
interest
to
deny
a
man
in
ordering
a
hearing
of
the
court
if
that's
what
he
want.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
mean
by
offensive
to
its
policy.
you
allow
arbitration
willingly.
by
offensive,
it
doesn't
mean
immoral,
it
doesn't
mean
as
a
point
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
stock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
policy
of
--
of
protecting
rights
as
utilized
in
courts
and
so
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
it's
hardly
so
reluctant
about
that.
that
has
been
the
law
of
the
english
speaking
word
(inaudible)
deal
before
our
legislation,
all
over
the
place
could
change
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask,
mr.
mcnamara,
what
was
in
the
court
of
proceeding
if
the
litigation
has
been
allowed
to
stay,
litigation
has
been
made
in
--
in
vermont
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
removed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
are
right
about
it
or
if
the
matter
is
in
doubt
so
we
don't
know
until
the
vermont
place
to
have
speech
then
the
present
problem
doesn't
arise.because
if
vermont
would
enforce
this,
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
can
we
find
that
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
happened
in
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
i
meant
to
inquire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
i
meant
to
inquire.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
the
--
the
board
of
commissioners
of
uniform
state
laws
may
not
know
but
in
their
last
meeting,
they
have
drafted
the
statute
now
for
submission
to
all
states
for
arbitration.
that
had
been
a
very
strongly
debated
matter
before
that
commission
for
many
years,
but
i
understand
they
have
now
done
that,
but
the
tendency
is
that
way.
now,
the
language
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
basis
--
justice

frankfurter
what
is
the
basis
--
what
decisions
are
there
that
both
of
you
agreed
on
by
vermont

court,
which
no
matter
how
long
ago,
merely
express
the
common
law
trend
that
you
cannot
vow
the
cause
of
action
because
of
the
prior
agreement
to
submit
to
arbitration.
justice

or
that
was
the
law
of

of
the
federal

until
relatively
recently,
whatever
it
is.
what
(voice

--
justice

don't

about

but
there

been

have
--
have
there
been

what
is
the
latest
case
in

1910.
justice

all
this

not

but

justice

but
the
recognition,
the

or
the

now
cited
the

has
all
been

long
after
(inaudible)
justice

and
we
need
to

of
the
vermont

enjoy
being

this

state

to
deal
about
going

has

in

could
we

this,
the

even

has
there
been
a
general
acquiesces
regarding
the
law
of
vermont,
arbitration
agreement
shall
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
were
asked
for
a
professional
opinion,
you
would
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
--
so
i
may
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcnamara
--
mcnamara,
may
i
see
if
i
understand
the
--the
nub
of
the(inaudible)
the
view
of
my
brother
black.
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
where
i
may
say
so
with
commendable
candid,
that
the
professional
while
you
haven't
got
a
case
later
than
1810
--
1910.
justice
felix

as
might
as
well
the
1810
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
supporting
cases,
1910.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
would
say
the
law
that
everybody
assumes
to
be
the
law
of
vermont,
the
professional
opinion
is
that
that
is
still
the
law
with
reference
to
agreement
made
in
vermont
by
vermont
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
vermont
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
code
for
execution
in
vermont.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
secondly,
you
say
however
that
a
contract
made
in
new
york
or
any
other
state
looking
to
enforce
it,
any
other
state
having
an
arbitration
existing
provision,
lawful
in
that
state
and
the
new
york
law
is
after
the
arbitration
statute
made
in
new
york
or
any
other
state
such
as
scheme
of
law.
looking
to
enforcement
in
vermont,
you
say
the
proposition
as
you've
indicated
wouldn't
govern
that
situation
and
that
a
contract
made
in
new
york
with
a
lawful
system
of
arbitration
draw
them
to
itself
into
vermont
with
respect
for
the
vermont
court
of
those
--
that
condition
in
the
contract,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
thirdly,
you
said,
that
isn't
true
in
any
even.
this
doesn't
come
in
--
wouldn't
be
requiring
of
erie
and
tompkins.
those
are
the
three
propositions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
that
order.
have
i
been
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
hope
that
mr.
clark
tends
to
require
--
better
to
tell
the
particulars
of
the
second
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
opinion
by
judge
hand?
when
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
second
circuit,
what
do
you
imply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
must
be
careful
about
that
because
have
--
so
many
justices
found
that
opinion
in
the
erie
case
over
on
the
ground
and
why
all
the
--
why
your
swift
--
why
swift
enticing
was
declared
illegal
and
unconstitutional,
although
it's
been
there
for
nearly
100
years,
was
because
even
congress
couldn't
even
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

jurisdiction
apply
non-state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
--
rather
than
to
be
said,
it
may
not
be
only
clear
that
congress
even
acted
to
that
constitutional
problem
that
such
would
be
by
directing
that
it
should
be
applied
to
diversity
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
arbitration
act
should
govern
diversity
cases
in
cases
where
the
state
could
be
--
which
is
this
situation
on
the
first
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
quite.
i'm
saying
you
have
to
answer
that
before
you
come
to
the
constitutional
problem
that
you've
given
an
answer
and
that's
properly
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
first
question
is
whether
congress
in
the
arbitration
act
didn't
pass
that
in
the
statute
and
we
have
ample
scope
for
litigation
or
arguing
under
federal
rights.
so
the
red
line
cases,
the
case
is
foreign
that
we
have
for
admiralty
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
though
it
required
vast
decision
to
allow
arbitration
even
in
the
hypothetic
cases
because
of
the
general
doctrine
against
ousting
jurisdiction,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
reason
why
it
was
that
it
--
it
would
be
--
is
the
common
law
reason
against
ousting
courts
in
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
can't
agree
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
so
--
we
have
so
many
other
practice
up
there
that
this
wouldn't
be
a
verdict
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.

have
you
out
of
the
category
judgment
law
office?
justice

how
quickly
could
one
get
a
determination
by
the
vermont
supreme
court
on
the
judgment?
i
should
ask
you,
i
don't
think
(voice

--
justice

a
year,
that
speed
in
that

where
you
have
such

we
just

an

can
you
spell
it,
mr.

justice

(voice

he's
a
very
great
man.
justice

you
--
do
you
claim
hard
if
--
if
your
(inaudible)
follows
the
lines
in
view
of
your
associate,
mr.
mcnamara,
is
that
all
this
question
of
whether
erie-tompkins
absorbs
this
agony
of
pressure
or
doesn't,
doesn't
matter
because
in
your
case,
you
asked
for
enforcement
of
the
new
york
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position
that
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
persuade
the
court
of
appeals
to
that
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
say
that
just
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
gentle,
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
they
come
back
and
--
was
the
award
made
a
matter
of
the
record
in
the
court
in
that
action?
i
should
suppose
so.

this

this

justice

mr.

mr.

suppose
you
and
your

pre-contradicted
if
this
case
arises.
if
this
question
--
if
the
question
was
argued
today
before
the
vermont
supreme
court,
were
the
contracts
entered
in
good
faith
on
the
verdict

new

for
execution
in
vermont

with
it,
it
does
not
illegalize
or
render
nugatory
of
provision
in
the
contract
for
arbitration,
doing
that
is
the
normal
thing
to
do
in
a
new
york
contract.
both
of
you
are
pretty
confident
by
assertions,
one
for
it.
does
that
--
vermont
supreme
court
--
is
that
properly
argued,
meaning
they're
argued
by
you.
(inaudible)
is
that
fair
to
get
to
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
isn't
that
fair?
as
far
as
vermont
law
is
concerned,
you're
pretty
confident
that
they
wouldn't
say,
“oh,
19
of
dissents
he
rendered
the
decision,
there's
a
man
who
did
there
and
we're
going
to
stick
to
that.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
prophecy
that
they
would.
otherwise
--
and
if
that
isn't
so,
that's
your
chief
reliance,
isn't
it?
that
vermont
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix

naturally,
you
came
here.
i'm
not
saying

you
want

the
(inaudible)
but
i'm
suggesting
that
might
(voice

--
justice

--
starting
off
with
vermont
law
isn't
for
you
and
me
to
guess
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
isn't
a
general
law
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
--
if
this
court
would
say
that
the
new
york
statute
where
the
contracts
made
in
new
york,
is
made
in
the
context
of
the
new
york
statute
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
law
requires
that
to
be
irrespective
throughout
the
country
that
has
to
reach?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
this
court
--
if
this
court
makes
pronouncement
and
conflicts
of
law
unaided
or
unrelated
to
the
requirement
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
law?
justice
felix

with
that
power.
justice
felix

it
might
be
a
good
(inaudible)
--
i
--
i
know
there's
already
in
that
jurisdiction
all
over
the
united
states
but
i
didn't
know
we
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it
would,
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
to
decide
whether
--
whether
that
kind
of
premise,
if
the
federal
court
would
enforce
vermont
law.
otherwise,
the
vermont
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
be
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
can't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
clark
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
more
than
a
conflict
argument
that
is
made
by
the
particular
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
full
faith
and
credit
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
conflicts
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
don't
know
--
we
don't
simply
as
a
court
pronounce
in
conflicts
of
law
for
the
--
for
the
country
at
large.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
that's
a
very
inviting
field
to
enter
but
that
is
in
the
--
within
our
confidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
clark
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
clark
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
that
to
make
distinction
between
an
agreement
made
in
vermont
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
rub
on
both
for
execution
in
vermont
and
an
agreement
made
in
new
york
right
into
vermont
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
execution
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
decided
by
vermont
on
vermont
conflicts
law
in
full
faith
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
or
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
got
vermont
conflicts
law,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
clark,
i
suppose
if
you
had
a
vermont
statute
which
for
certain,
(inaudible)
is
double
damages
and
the
suit
was
then
further
moved
to
the
federal
court.
i
should
think
anybody
would
have
a
hard
time
arguing
with
the
measure
of
damages
as
a
matter
of
remedy.
and
therefore,
the
federal
court
would
apply
the
old
remedy
and
therefore
the
government
and
its
provisions,
the
vermont
statute
doesn't
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
would
be
a
dollar
and
cent
establishment
of
substantiality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
to
bring
another
case
as
equal
to
this
case
so
we
could
have
some
more
discussion
to
the
matter
before
us.
