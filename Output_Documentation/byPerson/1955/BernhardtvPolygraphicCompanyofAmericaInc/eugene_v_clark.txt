mr.
eugene
v.
clark
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
know
as
i
can
remember
each
of
the
individual
questions
asked
in
this
discussion
of
this
nutty
problem
and
i
hope
that
if
there
is
anything
that
i
forget
to
address
myself
in
the
way
of
questions
that
--
has
already
been
put
by
members
of
the
court
that
they
will
please
address
the
questions
again
because
i
will
--
i
would
be
delighted
to
try
to
answer
them
if
i
can
remember
them
all.
i
might
say
in
regard
to
the
vermont
law
that
in
the
first
place
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
yes.
the
vermont
law
as
to
what
--
as
to
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
agreement
was
specifically
decided
by
judge
gibson.
in
fact,
he
was
so
certain
of
the
law
himself
that
he
asked
counsel
if
they
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
vermont
law
was
as
we
said
it
was
and
they
did.
and
so
we
did
not
argue
that
question
orally
other
than
a
few
preliminary
statements
before
he
made
a
statement.
judge
gibson,
a
federal
judge,
a
vermont
lawyer
sitting
in
vermont,
made
an
express
finding
on
that
matter
of
vermont
law.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that
question
was
not
disturbed
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
fact,
it
was
again
conceded
in
oral
argument
by
counsel,
mr.
mcnamara,
so
that
we
did
not
again
address
ourselves
orally
to
that
problem.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that
is
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that
is
correct.
the
matters
of
the
conflicts
problems
which
you
are
asking
about
now
were
briefed
by
both
parties
extensively
at
the
district
court
level.
and
they
were
argued
by
mr.
page
and
by
ourselves
at
the
district
court
level.
now,
the
district
court,
perhaps
unfortunately
because
the
problem
that's
now
raised
here
didn't
expressly
rule
on
the
conflicts
argument.
he
seemed
to
dispose
of
the
whole
thing
in
a
--
in
a
package
statement
with
reference
to
the
erie
doctrine.
the
question
was
argued
and
briefed
for
him.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
now
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
not
before
the
court
of
appeals
because
their
appeal
was
based
solely
on
what
they
interpret
to
be
his
--
judge
gibson's
mistake
on
the
federal
arbitration
act,
section
3.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
the
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
now,
let
me
say
something
about
that
if
the
court
please.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
as
you
had
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
well,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
this
case
does
have
three
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
pardon?
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
yes.
it's
this
--
this
case
really
in
my
view
has
three
aspects
or
at
least
all
of
which
are
crucial.
we
say
that
the
question
of
the
vermont
law
of
enforceability
was
settled
at
the
district
court
level.
i
don't
think
that
you
could
pick
a
court
more
unlikely
to
reverse
itself
on
a
question
that
it
has
pronounced
in
--
in
several
judicial
opinions,
however
ancient
than
the
vermont
supreme
court
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
--
without
benefit
of
a
statutory
amendment.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
i
do.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
i
do.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
i
do.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
if
the
court
please,
as
i
said,
there
are
three
aspects.
i'm
trying
to
dispose
of
the
first
one
first
because
i
think
that
that's
the
most
easily
disposed
off.
that's
the
question
of
what
is
the
vermont
law
on
arbitration
agreements,
not
the
conflicts
question
which
you
raise
nor
the
full
faith
and
credit
question
which
can
be
discussed
following
that
if
i
may.
the
vermont
law
is
settled.
now,
vermont
courts
aren't
given
the
(inaudible)
they
made
no
statement
that
arbitration
was
a
horrendous
thing.
they
merely
stated
the
law
as
they
found
it
at
that
time.
i
take
that
to
mean
a
statement
of
policy.
there
might
be
very
many
factors
that
might
have
determined
what
the
policy
would
be
at
that
time.
it
has
been
accepted
by
--
as
the
counsel
for
the
other
side
is
as
the
vermont
law
all
these
years
by
vermont
lawyers.
and
judge
gibson
thought
it
was
so
well
settled
that
he
didn't
even
ask
for
argument
on
the
question.
we
feel
that
this
policy
question
has
some
relation
to
the
full
faith
and
credit
issue
however,
and
we
do
feel
that
it
is
important
that
this
court
not
try
to
remake
the
law
for
vermont
under
the
guise
of
full
faith
and
credit
merely
because
it
doesn't
find
a
shattered
statement
in
the
vermont
supreme
court
as
to
why
they
rule
the
way
they
do
on
arbitration
agreement.
now,
in
the
very
case
which
they
have
cited
at
length
with
regard
to
the
view
of
vermont
case
of
conflicting
policies,
the
brown
against
perry
case,
i
should
point
out
that
in
that
case,
it
involves
an
application
of
the
hew
hampshire
wrongful
death
action,
if
i
remember
rightly,
in
vermont
courts.
now,
vermont
had
a
wrong
--
wrongful
death
statute
at
the
same
time.
there
was
no
conflict
of
policy
there
as
such
but
in
fact,
the
people
who
won
in
that
case
won
a
pyrrhic
victory
in
a
way
because
the
reason
they
wanted
the
new
hampshire
statute
was
because
the
measure
of
damages
was
much
broader.
it
include
pain
and
suffering
of
the
decedent.
and
at
that
time,
all
vermont
permitted
was
loss
to
the
next
of
keen,
pecuniarily
loss
to
the
next
of
keen.
and
it
is
a
striking
fact
that
the
court
in
that
brown
against
perry
case
decided
that,
"yes,
we
apply
the
vermont
--
the
new
hampshire
statue
in
vermont
as
to
wrongful
death.
but
the
measure
of
damages
being
a
matter
of
remedy,
we
apply."
so
that
people
that
won
that
appeal
were
nothing
because
in
fact,
the
measure
of
damages
is
probably
what
they
were
concerned
for.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that
was
decided
by
vermont.
they
didn't
mention
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
i
might
say.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
they
did
not.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
did
not.
but
if
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
but
it
was
a
conflicts
decision
obviously
and
it
did
state
that
this
a
matter
of
remedy,
the
measure
of
damages.
now,
whether
the
measure
of
damages
is
every
--
in
view
of
everybody,
i
don't
know.
i
think
that
--
that
remedy
is
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
--
a
useful
distinction
under
some
circumstances
but
it
obviously
is
a
fighting
word
in
many
cases.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that's
right.
there
you
have
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that
--
that
is
correct
and
that's
where
the
erie
and
tompkins
case
comes
in
of
course.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
yes.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
yes.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
he
did
said
that
vermont
law
did
not
permit
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements.
that
the
contract
was
then
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
this
very
one
we're
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
--
talking
about
here.
yes.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
but,
he
did
not
mention
in
his
position
--
in
his
opinion
new
york
law.
that
was
all
presented
to
him
in
argument
in
the
courts.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
the
conflicts
rule
is
implicit
because
it
was
necessary
to
his
decision
in
the
first
place.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
if
he
had
expressly
said
i
also
decide
the
conflicts
issue
and
then
made
a
ruling
on
that
and
then
applied
the
erie
to
it
with
facts
and
against
the
dissenter
and
all
that
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
went
on
the
murray
against
--
murray
against
mitsui
case.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
no,
they
decided
the
--
entirely
on
the
basis
of
federal
statute,
saying
merely
a
form
of
trial
something
which
is
within
federal
jurisdiction
and
subject
to
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
--
of
the
congress
to
control
through
their
control
of
procedure
in
federal
court.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
that
is
right.
that's
exactly
what
they
decided,
and
we
of
course
disagree
very
strenuously
for
--
with
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
gather
that
counsel
have
already
agreed
possibly
in
view
of
the
wilco
case
that
this
is
a
type
of
--
of
situation
which
would
substantially
affect
the
result.
and
perhaps
the
court
isn't
willing
to
let
it
go
on
concession
of
counsel.
i'd
be
willing
to
address
myself
to
that
further
if
you
feel
that
that's
necessary.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
oh,
there
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
but
could
i
make
one
closing
statement,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
in
this
matter
of
gant
decision
which
they
also
rely
on
in
new
york's
court
of
appeals.
the
new
york
case
said
specifically,
"we
treat
this
matter
of
enforceability
as
a
matter
of
remedy,
and
they
expressly
rejected
order
of
travelers
against
wolfe
as
being
applicable
and
is
requiring
full
faith
and
credit.
they
said
we,
however,
do
not
think
that
that
decision
wipes
out
the
old
rule
that
remedies
including
arbitration
are
regulated
by
the
law
of
the
forum.
now
in
summary,
i
think
that
this
case
has
to
--
mr.
eugene
v.
clark
i'm
sorry.
