mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
feel
that
the
contract
itself
here
is
very
important
in
determining
whether
or
not
we
have
a
right
to
a
stay
with
the
circuit
court
in
this
manner
ordered.
now
as
has
been
stated,
both
parties
to
this
contract
were
residents
of
the
state
in
new
york
at
the
time
the
contract
was
drawn
and
executed.
it
contemplated
and
the
contract
was
drawn
in
new
york
as
well.
the
contract
contemplated
that
the
petitioner
here
would
go
to
vermont
on
at
least
some
has
served
since
the
major
part
of
it
probably.
the
contract
is
executed
on
august
1st,
1952
and
about
that
day,
the
petitioner
did
remove
to
vermont.
his
employment
continued
only
until
the
end
of
october
--
towards
the
end
of
october
when
he
was
dismissed
or
the
relation
of
his
duties
as
he
claim.
that
was
in
1952,
and
in
february
of
this
year,
the
petitioner
started
his
breach
of
contract
action
in
the
county
court
in
bennington
county,
and
was
removed
by
us
to
the
federal
court
by
reason
of
diversity.
we
filed
our
answer
indicating
that
we
denied
his
rights
to
recover
on
the
breach
and
set
up
a
counterclaim
showing
damage
to
the
respondent
here
of
substantially
the
same
and
surmount
as
is
was
claimed
by
the
petitioner.
at
about
that
same
date,
we
proceeded
under
the
contract
provisions
to
institute
arbitration
proceedings
in
new
york
through
respondent's
new
york
counsel,
that
was
instituted
and
service
made
upon
the
petitioner
here.
following
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
there
is
no
dispute
about
service.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
we
are
--
yes.
and
the
--
we
served
under
the
new
york
statute
which
prevent
--
permits
service
by
registered
mail.
and
that
was
done
and
proper
bond,
filed
it
under
standards,
no
question
for
proper
arbitration
proceedings
were
instituted
in
new
york.
very
shortly
there
afterwards,
the
day
or
two
later,
we
moved
for
a
stay
in
the
district
court
to
permit
us
to
continue
with
the
arbitration.
that
matter
was
heard
and
the
court
denied
it,
not
our
motion
for
stay
on
the
ground,
the
court
held
that
erie-tompkins
did
control
here,
and
we
filed
our
appeal
which
was
heard
by
the
second
circuit.
and
that
circuit
in
the
unanimous
opinion
ruled
that
we
were
entitled
for
the
stay.
certiorari
was
then
allowed
here
and
that
brings
us
to
this
present
point.
now,
i
think
unimportant
to
call
the
court's
attention,
i
think
this
may
as
we
conceive
it
be
decisible,
this
whole
issue.
and
that
is
that
when
the
contract
is
drawn
and
executed,
there
was
inserted
therein
paragraph
11,
“the
parties
hereto
--
hereto
do
here
agree
that
any
differences
claimed,
no
matter
a
dispute
arise
between
them
out
of
this
agreement
or
connected
herewith
shall
be
submitted
by
them
to
arbitration
by
the
american
arbitration
society
or
its
successor.
and
that
the
determination
of
said
american
arbitration
association
or
its
successors
or
any
arbitrators
appointed
--
designated
by
the
said
association
on
such
matters
shall
be
final
and
absolute.”
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
arbitration
shall
be
conducted
under
the
pertinent
sections
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
act
relating
to
arbitration.
but
a
further
provision
that
we
consider
very
important
is
paragraph
14
of
the
contract,
and
that
is
as
follows.
"in
short
the
parties
hereto
do
hereby
stipulate
and
agree,
that
is
their
intention
and
covenant
that
this
agreement
forums
hereunder.
and
all
suits
and
special
proceedings
hereunder,
be
construed
in
accordance
with
and
under
and
pursuant
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
that
many
special
--
any
actions,
special
proceeding,
or
other
proceeding
that
may
be
brought
arising
out
of
or
in
connection
with
over
reasons
of
agreement,
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
shall
be
applicable
and
shall
govern
to
the
exclusion
of
the
law
of
any
other
forum
without
regard
to
the
jurisdiction
in
which
any
action
or
special
proceeding
may
be
instituted.
those
two
sections
appear
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
now,
i
understood
my
brother
to
say
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
we
think
it
is.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
i
consider
that
they
--
that
this
court
has
so
held
in
--
in
the
--
it
wasn't
exactly
that
--
that
provision,
i
don't
want
to
indicate
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
--
in
the
commercial
travelers.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
well
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
valid
and
i
think
this
court
has
so
indicted
that
a
provision
in
a
contract
such
as
that
had
to
be
given
full
faith
and
credit
in
the
federal
courts
or
by
the
courts
in
the
state
in
which
the
matter
came
before
them
for
adjudication
in
the
order
of
commercial
travelers
against
wolfe
in
331
u.s.
that
was
a
question
of
the
stay
in
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
well,
that
was
in
the
case.
yes,
that
was
all
in
there.
but
the
--
this
court
held
that
the
very
short
term
limitations
in
the
contract
which
was
also
had
been
adopted
by
the
statute
of
ohio,
the
parent
whole
office
of
the
plaintiff
company,
that
that
was
applicable
in
iowa,
i
believe,
where
the
case
was
tried
rather
than
the
iowa
statute.
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes,
that
was
a
fraternal
order,
yes.
and
there
was
a
bill
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes,
there
was
great
emphasis
put
on
that
time.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes,
and
there
was
quite
a
vigorous
dissent
as
i
recall.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes.
but
we
say
that
--
that
those
two
clauses
of
the
contract
are
very
pertinent
here.
now,
the
--
my
brothers
have
been
asked
by
justice
frankfurter
and
others
as
to
whether
or
not
we
had
any
lower
court
rulings
determining
how
matters
of
this
nature
would
be
handled.
in
the
first
case
to
come
before
the
new
york
courts
on
this
was
the
marchant
against
mead-morrison
company
and
decided
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
1929
after
the
determination
after
the
passing
of
the
arbitration
statute
in
new
york.
now,
that
was
a
case
in
which
a
main
corporation
contracted
to
sell
and
deliver
tractors
to
a
new
york
corporation.
the
contract
is
executed
in
massachusetts.
the
tractors
were
to
be
manufactured
and
delivered
to
massachusetts,
and
the
contract
contained
an
arbitration
clause.
it
doesn't
set
up
in
the
arbitration
clause
that
it
was
the
arbitrations
to
be
under
the
new
york
state
law.
now,
that
was
brought
--
arbitration
was
sought
in
that
case
in
the
courts
of
new
york
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
following
question,
“did
the
supreme
court
or
judge
there
power
--
have
power
under
section
4
of
the
new
york
law
to
appoint
a
third
arbitrator?
it
appears
that
their
arbitration
agreement
called
for
each
party
to
appoint
an
arbitrator,
and
those
two
were
to
appoint
a
third.
but
each
party
did
appoint
an
arbitrator
and
they
couldn't
agree
upon
the
third,
and
they
appealed
to
the
court
of
new
york
to
have
the
third
one
appointed.
and
the
court
did
appoint
the
third
arbitrator,
and
objection
was
made
there
to
the
seller,
the
one
who
didn't
want
the
arbitration
in
new
york,
attack
the
legality
of
the
order
on
two
grounds.
on
the
first
point,
argues
that
the
arbitration
provision
as
quoted
above
provided
for
arbitration
in
massachusetts
and
nowhere
else.
and
therefore,
new
york
had
no
power
to
act
under
section
4
of
the
new
york
arbitration
act.
judge
cardozo
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case,
and
if
i
may
quote
from
the
latter
part
of
one
paragraph.
judge
cardozo
said,
"this
remedy
may
lawfully
be
extended
to
contracts
of
manufacture
made
in
massachusetts
and
there
to
be
performed
unless
it
is
one
of
the
terms
of
arbitration
clause
implied
if
not
expressed
that
the
arbitration
shall
proceed
in
a
--
in
a
particular
locality.”
express
restriction
there
is
none
in
the
contract
now
before
us,
whether
one
as
to
be
implied
is
the
question
of
intention
to
determine
in
the
light
of
the
context
annotation.
this
is
what
was
done.
the
court
discharged
of
its
judicial
function
was
called
upon
to
declare
the
implications
of
the
promise.
we
do
not
say
at
this
time
the
determination
is
free
from
error
and
not
for
the
present
purposes
that
is
not
to
be
ignored
as
void.
in
other
words,
and
in
that
case,
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
arbitration
act
was
gone
into
and
rather
determined
by
judge
cardozo.
now,
there,
serious
case
where
case
where
the
only
connection
that
any
of
the
parties
or
any
of
the
agreement
had
to
new
york
in
the
actual
contract
is
a
fact
that
one
of
the
parties
was
a
new
york
corporation.
we
have
the
next
case
in
the
matter
of
gant
and
the
situation
of
parties
in
the
terms
of
arbitration
or
as
follows
that
both
parties
were
at
all
times
none
resident
of
new
york.
the
arbitration
provision
called
for
arbitration
in
new
york.
that
was
the
--
one
of
the
parties
was
a
resident
in
north
carolina
and
the
other
was
in
nicaraguan
company,
and
a
disagreement
arose
and
the
nicaraguan
company
sought
arbitration
in
new
york.
the
gant
didn't
reply
but
petition
for
a
stay
of
the
arbitration
in
new
york,
that's
the
north
carolina
party.
he
argued
the
law
on
that
--
of
--
under
the
law
of
north
carolina,
arbitration
provision
was
void
and
therefore
the
new
york
courts
could
not
force
him
to
arbitrate.
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
arbitration
was
not
void,
it
was
merely
voidable
in
north
carolina,
and
his
petition
for
a
stay
of
the
arbitration
proceedings
was
denied
and
the
arbitration
was
carried
out.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision
used
this
language,
“the
place
of
performance
of
the
arbitration
section,
though
not
other
parts
of
the
september
agreement
was
to
be
in
new
york.”
new
york
statute,
that's
the
civil
practice
act
in
section
--
paragraph
84,
provides
complete
compulsion
and
full
enforcement
as
to
such
promises
to
arbitrate
future-arising
disputes.
and
apparently
on
the
strength
of
that,
that
was
the
nub
of
their
decision
in
that
case.
and
further
they
said,
some
of
the
parties
solemnly
promise
to
arbitrate
their
controversies
in
new
york.
and
by
a
case
in
statute
law
of
new
york
then
was
and
now
is
that
such
an
agreement
is
a
consent
of
the
parties
thereto
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
this
state
to
enforce
such
contract
for
such
submission.
now,
that
of
course
is
less
strong
than
the
case
before
the
court
here.
then
there's
one
other
case
that
is
reported
without
opinion
in
which
there
were
two
new
york
corporations,
also
is
in
new
york,
entered
a
commercial
contract
in
new
york
and
had
a
--
an
arbitration
provision
in
their
contract.
later,
both
parties
moved
to
connecticut,
dispute
arose,
one
party
petitioned
for
arbitration
in
new
york
and
the
other
party
moved
for
a
stay
of
the
arbitration
proceedings
because
a
civil
case
had
been
commenced
in
connecticut.
the
court
denied
that
motion,
ordered
arbitration
to
proceed
and
said
that
even
though
the
case
was
pending
in
connecticut,
there
was
nothing
inconsistent
in
there
allowing
arbitration
since
that
was
the
sense
of
the
contract
and
the
agreement
made
by
the
party.
the
judge
said
in
so
rolling,
called
the
contract
in
1936
was
made
this
day
by
new
york
corporations
therefore
has
consent
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
enforce
the
contract.”
now
briefly,
your
--
that
covers
our
situation
to
their
brief,
some
other
matters
here
but
here
we
have
two
new
york
parties
contracting
to
arbitrate
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
that
all
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
would
apply
to
their
contract
regardless
of
whatever
the
law
might
be
of
any
other
forum.
we
say
that
by
reason
of
that,
the
district
court
of
vermont
should
have
and
was
required
to
allow
our
petition
and
grant
our
motion
because
the
court
in
vermont
should
be,
as
the
new
york
case
have
held,
bound
by
the
contract
into
which
the
parties
entered.
and
if
the
--
the
--
since
the
arbitration
had
been
commenced
that
we
were
entitled
to
the
stay
to
permit
completion
of
the
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
you
mean
if
we
had
--
had
not
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
had
not
removed.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
we
think
that
with
a
contract
of
this
nature
as
strong
as
this
was,
and
with
the
defense
of
our
answer
that
we
were
bound
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york,
it's
our
sound
opinion,
though
we
have
no
strong
case
to
that
effect
that
vermont
would
have
enforced
the
new
york
contract.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
oh,
that's
very
true.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
well,
we
have
given
in
our
brief
here,
i
haven't
gone
into
it
and
my
brother
intends
to
argue
the
question
of
conflicts
of
law,
the
contracts
conflicts
of
law
doctrine
as
we
see
it
applied
here.
but
as
we
see
it,
the
vermont
law
on
the
matter
of
arbitration
is
so
sketchy.
in
the
first
place,
there
had
been
no
decision
in
40
years.
the
last
decision
was
40
years
ago.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes,
i
know
that.
but
what
has
happened
has
been
a
trend
towards
our
type
of
action
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
--
very
decidedly.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that,
though
the
question
of
enforceability
or
non-enforceability
of
an
arbitration
agreement
has
never
been
argued
in
an
opinion.
the
opinion
has
never
gone
into
the
reasoning
for
that
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
they
(inaudible)
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
well,
now
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
we
don't
feel
that
any
case
has
quite
exactly
said
that.
now,
they
have
passed
upon
the
doctrine
in
vermont
as
merely
accepting
the
common
law
doctrine
that
it
is
thus
and
so
and
we
will
follow
it.
they
have
never
reasoned
out.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
oh,
yes,
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
putting
forth
harry
against
brown.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
well,
the
last
case
was
in
83
vermont
132,
mead's
administrator
against
owen.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
that
was
in
1910.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
that
is
the
last
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
substantially.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes,
and
1920
was
really
--
1920
when
it
really
started,
the
trend
became
active.
but
we
--
we
follow
that
if
the
court
please.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
i
would
say
yes
frankly,
among
the
bar
that
they
are
not
enforceable.
they
are
recognized
and
we
have
them.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
but
they
--
as
to
compelling
a
person
to
submit
to
arbitration,
i
would
say
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
i
would
say
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
you
cannot
be
forced
into
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
i
would
say.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
we
say
that
vermont
is
required
under
the
federal
--
under
the
article
iv
of
the
federal
constitution
to
recognize
this
because
it
is
a
substantial
body
of
law
both
by
statute
and
decision
in
new
york
state,
which
the
parties
incorporated
into
that
contract
and
should
be
and
must
be
recognized
by
vermont
in
acting
on
this
contract.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
we
say
yes
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
well
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
it
might
--
it
might
but
it
doesn't
--
i
--
i
still
say
that
the
courts
of
vermont
would
have
to
recognize
the
law
of
new
york
here.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
i
think
they'd
be
compelled
under
article
iv
of
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
i
think
--
well,
i'm
saying
that
because
i
feel
that
our
state
court
in
a
case
such
as
this
with
a
contract
between
the
authors
executed
in
new
york
and
specifically
drawing
into
the
contract
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
would
be
enforced
by
our
state
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
well,
as
it
said
in
one
of
those
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
either
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
there
was
language
in
either
the
commercial
travellers
case
or
the
john
hancock
mutual
life
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
no,
the
--
but
the
erie
and
tompkins
doctrine
was
treated
in
the
commercial
travelers
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
and
in
there
it
stated
that
erie-tompkins
does
not
have
apply
in
all
cases
where
a
diversity
is
involved.
but
if
there
is
a
statute
or
if
there
is
an
agreement
as
to
some
matter,
as
to
what
the
forums
will
shall
be
or
something
like
that,
that
erie-tompkins
can
give
way
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
such
as
in
this
--
in
the
--
the
commercial
travelers
case,
there
was
a
statute
which
was
contrary
to
the
statute
in
--
in
iowa,
and
had
they
been
applied
--
had
the
erie-tompkins
been
applied
there,
the
statute
of
iowa
would
have
to
be
applied.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
but
they
said
no,
if
--
if
the
fact
gave
way
where
the
parties
had
contracted
to
something
different.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
now,
here
they
have.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
well,
i
--
i
agree
it
might
lead
to
a
substantially
different
result.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
1910.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
[laughs]
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
century
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
it
can,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes.
i
would
like
to
limit
it
that
way.
i
didn't
limit
it
that
way
before
but
i
would
like
to
limit
it
if
i
can.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
they
say
so,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
no.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
joseph
a.
mcnamara
thank
you.
