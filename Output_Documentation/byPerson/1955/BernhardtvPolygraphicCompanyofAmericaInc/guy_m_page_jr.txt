mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
have
been
--
been
listening
to
this
last
colloquy
between
mr.
mcnamara
and
the
court.
now,
i
think
we
ought
to
--
we
ought
to
get
it
clear
that
we're
dealing
with
--
with
the
two
different
kinds
of
situations
here.
when
we
went
into
federal
court,
we
went
in,
in
reliance
upon
the
construction
of
section
3
which
the
second
circuit
had
announced.
it's
a
construction
of
some
20
years
of
standing.
and
the
construction
clearly
made
section
3
applicable
to
our
case
and
that
was
so
under
that
construction
without
regard
to
whether
we
got
in
under
section
2
so
that
we
would
have
had
section
4
remedies.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
we
had
in
mind
the
--
the
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
and
that's
--
and
hardly
say
now.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
think
it
was
judge
hand
in
the
shanferoke
case
that
started
the
ball
rolling
on
the
--
the
disassociation
of
section
3
from
the
rest
of
the
act.
that
was
picked
up
by
judge
goodrich,
who
--
who
expressly
held
that
section
3
was
disassociated
and
i
believe
there's
another
opinion
in
there.
but
that
did
seem
to
be
and
as
we
studied
those
cases
on,
we
felt
and
we
apparently
were
vindicated
in
that
feeling
that
the
second
circuit
would
make
that
construction
of
the
act.
now,
assuming
that
that
is
the
construction
which
stands,
that
section
3
is
broadened
up
to
touch
this
case
or
that
this
case
would
fit
into
section
3
on
any
construction
then
we're
faced
to
a
one
kind
of
problem
of
how
much
state
law
we're
going
to
absorb
under
the
erie
rule.
now,
somewhere,
there's
a
limit
to
the
amount
of
state
law
which
gets
absorbed
into
the
federal
court
and
we
think
that
that
limit
certainly
is
reached
where
congress
has
enacted
a
specific
method
of
the
federal
courts
doing
their
business
as
they
have
in
the
arbitration
act.
now,
that's
one
situation.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
yes,
i
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
we
appreciate
that
it's
a
constitutional
problem,
and
undoubtedly,
there
is
some
restriction
from
the
power
of
commerce
for
congress
to
legislate
a
procedure
for
the
federal
courts.
we
just
don't
think
it's
reached
with
the
federal
arbitration
act.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
by
directing
that
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
so
you
put
that
in
as
a
rule
of
construction?
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
wonder
if
that
isn't
a
case
about
admiralty
law
and
not
a
case
about
--
about
arbitration.
but
the
emphasis
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
i
understand
that
admiralty
case,
that
red
cross
case.
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
doubted
its
own
power
to
invade
the
federal
domain
to
the
extent
of
giving
this
remedy,
this
machinery
for
enforcing
federally
created
rights
or
rights
that
originated
in
the
federal
domain.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i'm
just
not
familiar
with
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that.
i
only
know
the
result
and
i
know
that
this
court
didn't
go
along
with
that.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
they
said
that
--
well,
the
state
of
new
york
has
got
some
--
something
to
do
in
admiralty
fields
and
this
one
of
the
things
they
could
do.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
really
germane
to
the
issue
we're
dealing
with
here.
the
language
is
--
worries
us
of
course.
but
the
point
i
was
making
now
is
we've
got
one
problem
when
we're
dealing
with
an
act
of
congress
which
has
something
to
say
about
the
way
the
federal
courts
are
run,
that
is
arbitration
or
not.
and
we
have
quite
a
different
situation
if
that
act
of
congress,
for
some
reason,
doesn't
apply
on
this
case,
and
there,
we
suspect
that
the
amount
of
state
law
that's
going
to
be
absorbed
is
quite
a
good
deal
or
more.
we
think
that's
the
--
that's
the
teaching
of
the
york
case
that
you've
got
to
come
up
with
a
substantial
result.
and
if
there's
one
thing
that
all
four
counsel
agree
with
here,
it's
that
--
that
arbitration
is
--
does
substantially
affect
the
result
within
the
meaning
of
the
york
case.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
again
to
just
what
this
new
york
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
haven't
heard
anybody
say
no
otherwise
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
we
think
so.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
to
just
what
this
agreement
is
that
we're
dealing
with.
we
--
we
feel
that
this
--
this
contract
that's
here
being
--
being
construed,
this
breach
of
contract
question
as
before
the
court
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
these
old
vermont
cases.
these
were
all
domestic
submissions.
they
were
--
they
were
matters
which
were
submitted
to
arbitration
for
some
reason
or
other.
there
was
a
revocation
which
apparently
satisfied
the
counsel
that
it
had
been
an
effective
revocation.
and
so,
the
--
the
submission
was
a
dead
letter
as
far
as
affecting
the
resolution
of
the
differences
in
court.
and
that's
all
in
the
world
those
cases
have
anything
to
do
with,
they
aren't
our
case.
this
would
be
a
case
of
first
impression
in
vermont.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
it's
a
case
of
first
impression
here
in
this
court
too.
so
we
think
the
vermont
cases
such
as
they
are
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
now,
if
i
were
under
vermont
subject,
i
think
i
have
heard
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
questions
a
suggestion
that
perhaps
there
is
some
burning
local
issue
here
which
ought
to
be
adjudicated
for
the
first
time
in
the
vermont
court.
i
don't
think
there
is.
i
think
if
you
stop
9
out
of
10
lawyers
on
the
streets
of
burlington
and
asked
them
what
they
thought
about
arbitration,
they
wouldn't
have
an
opinion.
they
wouldn't
care
much.
i've
seen
it
once
or
twice
in
the
local
agreements
but
as
far
as
whether
the
states
barred
or
against
it,
and
whether
our
courts
work
fast
enough
without
the
assistance
of
this
extraordinary
forum,
i
never
heard
the
matter
discussed
except
in
connection
with
this
particular
case
that
we've
been
engaged
in.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
could
get
the
legislature
excited
about
this
at
all.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes,
sir,
we
do.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
mr.
mcnamara
has
been
around
the
courts
more
than
i
have.
he
just
said
a
year
and
i
suppose
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
that's
down
in
bennington
county.
[laughs]
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
we're
a
little
more
rushed
up
in
chedington.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
think
it
would
take
quite
a
long
time.
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
court
opted
staying
from
deciding
this
case
on
the
ground
that
it's
vermont's
business.
we
really
think
it's
a
question
which
--
and
we
suspect
the
granting
of
certiorari
here
suggest
that
this
court
feels
that
it
affects
a
lot
people
--
a
lot
of
people
other
than
the
ones
involved
in
this
case.
and
if
i
had
to
make
a
guess,
i
would
say
people
on
--
in
vermont
whereas
little
affected
by
it
as
--
as
almost
any
people
i
could
think
of
in
the
united
states.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
there
is
a
little
bit.
certainly,
our
basic
proposition
up
there
is
the
lex
loci
governance,
and
that's
nothing
unique
to
our
state.
there
is
more
or
less
by
happens
stands
one
case
here
as
in
years
ago
where
our
court
found
occasion
to
remark
the
--
the
law
in
governing
an
arbitration
bond.
i
think
there,
the
matter
had
gone
through
to
award
and
it
was
an
action
on
the
bond.
and
they
made
some
remark
to
the
effect
that
the
matter
governing
this
arbitration
business
was
--
was
the
law
of
canada.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
there's
no
special
gimmicks
on
the
vermont
law
there,
they
are
few
cases
involving
it.
there
are
some
--
some
language
in
the
cases
which
say
that
the
parties
--
which
suggest
the
parties
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
we
have
not
perhaps
discussed
to
it
as
extensively
as
we
should
have.
i've
got
here
on
page
37
of
--
of
the
respondent's
brief.
we
mentioned
three
cases
there.
this
woodrow
v.
o'conner
is
that
old
arbitration
bond
case.
and
then
there
were
a
couple
of
cases
more
recent
which
suggests
the
parties
can
--
can
have
something
to
say
about
the
applicable
law.
by
the
way,
they
write
their
contract.
i
did
put
in
that
brown
v.
perry
case
on
this
business
of
public
policy.
i
have
a
suspicion
that
some
of
the
inquiries
made
by
the
court
on
that
are
--
are
whimsical
in
part
as
to
whether
or
not
we
have
a
strong
animus
against
arbitration.
if
we
have,
i've
never
heard
of
it.
here
in
this
brown
v.
perry
case,
the
court
laid
down
its
rule,
the
rule
for
guidance
when
it's
dealing
with
a
statue
of
another
state.
and
i
think
it's
worthy
of
quotation,
”a
court
should
not
--
this
is
a
vermont
court
speaking,
“in
otherwise
proper
cases
refuse
to
apply
the
law
of
a
foreign
state,
however
unlike
it's
own,
unless
it
is
contrary
to
pure
morals
or
abstract
justice
or
unless
the
enforcement
would
be
an
evil
example
and
harmful
to
its
own
people.”
the
statute
of
another
state
is
not
contrary
to
public
policy
merely
because
it's
materially
different
from
our
own
or
because
we
have
no
statute
on
the
subject.
now,
if
there's
any
question
of
pure
morals
or
abstract
justice
involved
here,
i
suspect
our
court
would
take
a
view
that
a
fellow
ought
not
to
have
it
made
easy
for
him
to
welch
on
an
agreement.
but
we
think
that's
--
if
there
is
any
moral
question
involved
then
it's
along
those
lines
rather
than
this
--
this
ousting
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
there's
a
case
back
--
this
fits
in
the
old
general
law
category
back
in
1918.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
the
principle
authority
for
the
quotation
was
biehl.
there's
a
case
that
a
man
named
hough
wrote
--
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
h-o-u-g-h.
yes,
sir.
i
know
nothing
about
him
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
it's
a
--
it's
a
fine
opinion,
[laughs]
that's
all
i
know.
that
he
there
said
that
--
that
he
had
to
follow
the
united
states
supreme
court
because
he
was
a
federal
judge,
and
he
would
follow
this
old
revocability
cases
which
are
matters
of
general
law.
he
said
that
in
the
last
paragraph.but
before
saying
that,
he
took
8
or
10
pages
to
excoriate
this
revocability
rule,
and
we'd
--
we'd
cite
that
to
the
vermont
court
if
we
had
had
--
we
were
put
to
it
on
this
business
of
the
pure
morals
and
abstract
justice
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
that's
our
position.
we
think
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
this
is
a
new
york
agreement.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
no,
sir
that's
--
well,
i
think
perhaps
i
should
explain
why
we
did
not.
we
went
into
federal
district
court
and
we
had
some
briefing
done
on
that.
it
isn't
as
thorough
as
we've
gotten
into
later
because
of
the
time
limitations.
and
i
got
about
partway
through
it
and
that
the
court
told
me
he
didn't
take
much
of
my
ideas.
so
then
we
switched
over
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
i
can't
remember
his
exact
words,
but
he
made
it
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
pretty
much
along
those
lines.
so
at
any
rate,
i
thought
i'd
better
switch
over
into
the
federal
statute
into
that.
and
we
thought
we're
on
pretty
good
ground
on
that
federal
statute,
and
the
court
of
appeals
thought
we
were.
but
we
don't
--
the
granting
of
certiorari
here,
we
thought
we
better
go
back
to
some
of
these
matters
which
are
--
are
independent
of
the
statute.
and
that's
why
our
brief
reads
the
way
it
does
in
this
court.
this
--
i
want
to
go
back
again
on
this
business
of
exactly
what
the
contract
is
we're
dealing
with
because
i
think
that's
how
you
get
--
that's
the
answer
to
these
cases
in
that
particular
contract
that
was
made.
now,
mr.
mcnamara
started
to
read
that
up,
so
it's
a
pretty
good
idea
that
we're
construing
an
agreement
to
have
the
agreement
here
before
us.
"the
parties
hereto
do
agree
that
any
differences,
claim,
or
matter
in
dispute
arising
between
them
out
of
this
agreement
or
connected
herewith
shall
be
submitted
by
them
to
arbitration,
by
the
american
arbitration
association
or
its
successor.
and
that
the
determination
of
the
american
arbitration
association
or
its
successors
or
any
arbitrators
designated
by
said
association
on
such
matters
shall
be
final
and
absolute.
the
said
arbitrator
shall
be
governed
by
the
duly
promulgated
rules
and
regulations,
the
american
arbitration
association
or
its
successor
and
the
pertinent
provisions
of
the
civil
practice
act
for
the
state
of
new
york
relating
to
arbitrations.
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
may
be
entered
as
a
judgment
in
any
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
or
elsewhere."
and
in
this
fourteenth
article,
they
expressly
incorporate
this
new
york
law
in
the
agreement.
so
this
contract
embodied
this
new
york
doctrine
as
a
part
of
it.
and
these
provisions,
section
1450,
of
course
we
have
the
basic
provision
in
section
1448
which
says
that
these
agreements
shall
hereafter
be
valid,
enforceable,
and
irrevocable.
now,
the
legislature
conceivably
could
have
put
a
period
to
the
statute
right
there
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
it.
that
i
guess,
everyone
would
say
that
sounds
pretty
substantive
and
we
might
not
be
arguing
this
remedy
business.
well,
they
didn't
do
that
in
order
to
implement
this
declaration
that
it
was
valid,
enforceable,
and
irrevocable.
they
went
ahead
and
provided
that
when
you
make
an
agreement
in
new
york,
you
consent
in
advance
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
new
york
--
the
courts
over
your
person,
so
that
you
can't
defeat
the
agreement
by
leaving
the
state.
they
provided
for
a
stay
in
section
1451,
not
exactly
the
same
stay
we're
asking
for
but
a
stay
under
their
statutes.
in
1452,
they
gave
the
power
to
name
an
arbitrator
and
that
stops
all
this
chicanery
of
writings
for
scratching
every
name
off
the
list
that's
submitted
to
you
so
that
you
can
put
it
off
indefinitely.
1461,
they
said
that
this
award
could
become
a
judgment.
in
1466,
they
said
it
will
have
the
same
force
and
effect
as
a
judgement.
the
cases
which
have
come
up
under
the
statute
amply
are
a
fruition
of
these
provisions.
there
is
the
--
the
marsh
case,
a
massachusetts
contract
made
in
massachusetts.
performance
of
the
container
contracts
certainly
at
massachusetts.
nothing
said
about
the
place
of
performance
of
the
arbitration
clause
and
main
in
new
york
parties.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
this
thing
should
be
enforced
according
to
its
terms,
and
they
presented
a
moving
party
with
a
judgement
which
was
entitled
the
full
faith
and
credit
in
other
states.
but
there
has
incidentally
been
since
the
shafer
v.
metro-goldwyn-mayer,
so
far
as
i
know,
there
has
been
no
--
no
quarrel
about
the
effect
of
these
ex
parte
awards.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
been
anything
said
one
way
or
the
other.
i
don't
think
there's
anything
about
ousting
the
court's
jurisdiction
in
vermont
cases.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
can't
offhand
think
of
anything
of
that
sort.
we
looked
a
little
bit
along
those
lines
for
something
--
of
course,
we
weren't
going
to
find
anything
on
point
of
something
peripheral.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
don't
recall
finding
anything.
now,
the
lawyers
being
what
they
are,
sometimes,
they
find
something
they
don't
like
and
forget
about
it.
but
i
--
but
i
don't
remember
anything
of
that
sort.
and
i
don't
--
there
was
nothing
very
discouraging
if
i
didn't
do
it.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
he
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
--
done
if
i
know
just
what
he
did
he
hold.
he
--
i
know
he
licked
us.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
he
--
he
went
ahead
and
said
that
if
we
convinced
him
they
showed
him
the
need,
he'd
enjoin
us
from
proceeding
that
arbitration
in
new
york.
but
as
just
what
he
held
on
this
erie
v.
tompkins
rule
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
question
has
ever
been
presented
in
that
fashion
to
the
vermont
supreme
court.
and
i
don't
--
unless
memory
is
playing
me
tricks
here,
i
don't
think
there's
any
such
discussion
of
that
in
the
old
vermont
cases.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
guess
that's
one
of
the
things
that
these
old
cases
used
to
say.
i
think
they
have
some
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
the
judge
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
probably
that
is
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
explanations
which
was
given.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes,
there
is
something
in
the
constitution
about
a
jury
trial.
we
don't
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
say,
i
have
something
a
little
bit
on
our
vermont
arbitration
years
and
years
ago.
it's
not
than
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
modern
day
and
age
and
it's
washed
out
of
our
rule
book
now.
but
years
ago,
there
used
to
be
a
submission
by
rule
of
court.
and
once
there
have
been
a
submission
by
rule
of
court,
i
think
there's
--
some
of
these
cases
in
the
federal
reporter
or
not
the
federal
reporter
but
way,
way
back.
once
that
had
been
submitted
by
rule
of
court,
they
discontinued
the
main
action,
and
those
parties
were
bound
by
their
submitting
there.
now
of
course,
they
had
to
go
in
--
they
had
to
have
the
consent
to
get
into
that
situation.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
they
had
to
have
the
consent
of
the
parties
at
the
time
the
submission
was
made.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
but
once
a
fellow
had
submitted,
then
the
gavel
had
come
down,
he
couldn't
get
up
and
revoke
later
on.
he
was
bound
just
as
surely
as
a
fellow
was
bound
in
new
york
state
today.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
think
so.
although,
there
is
some
language
also
about
the
action
--
the
main
action
being
discontinued.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
or
--
or
possibly
suspended
but
there
are
three
or
four
of
those
--
those
cases.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
oh,
i
suppose
the
--
of
course
i
don't
know.
maybe
our
court
would
depart
from
those
old
cases.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes,
i
would
think
if
--
purely
domestic
arbitration
agreement
is
made
in
vermont
today
that
there's
nothing
to
stop
one
fellow
from
--
from
revoking
or
backing
out
of
it.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
think
once
he's
told
the
superior
judge
and
the
superior
judge
has
made
an
order
that
they
go
ahead
and
submit
this
to
arbitration,
i
think
if
he
walks
in
the
next
day
and
said
judge
i
--
i've
changed
my
mind
on
that.
the
judge
would
have
a
--
would
be
correct
in
saying
that
he
couldn't
change
his
mind,
and
that
award
would
--
would
settle
his
rights
whether
he
attended
that
hearing
or
not.
he
couldn't
get
out
of
it
then
under
vermont
law.
but
that's
--
that's
rule
of
the
court
stuff.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
we
think
this
court
could
give
him
some
guidance
to
get
through
this
--
this
remedy
confusion
business.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
certainly,
i
hope
there
wasn't.
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
oh,
yes.
i
think
we
have
to
take
that
--
that
position
here
if
your
question
means,
do
he
want
to
back
and
try
that
on
a
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
--
declaratory
judgment.
i
don't
want
to
do
it.
we
can
help
him.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well
now,
i
have
one
other
thought
that
may
--
that
may
--
that
might
change
your
thinking
on
that.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
--
somewhere
in
our
brief
here
toward
the
end,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
there
isn't
any
more
federal
general
law
of
arbitration.
that
stuff
is
all
gone
with
erie.
and
when
this
--
these
things
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
that
they
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
there
isn't
any
general
law
doctrine
such
as
judge
hough
applied
in
the
trinidad
case
that
the
old
supreme
court
cases
are
no
longer
authority
because
there
isn't
any
federal
common
law
anymore.
all
of
the
cases
which
have
come
in
thus
far
into
federal
courts
since
the
erie
case,
i
think
all
of
them
have
involved
the
arbitration
act.
and
this
expansion
of
section
3
has
really
displaced
the
--
the
ordinary
diversity
case
in
the
federal
court.
they
--
they
do
the
same
thing
that
they
did
in
our
case
as
we
ask
them
to.
they
apply
the
federal
acts
so
you
don't
at
least
get
--
they
haven't
really
gotten
into
this
erie
stuff.
now,
what
happens
when
you
get
a
--
and
it's
bound
to
come
up
sooner
or
later,
particularly
the
uniformed
commissioners
enact
this
law,
are
successful
in
getting
it
enacted
in
more
states.
what
happens
when
you
have
these
cases
coming
into
the
federal
courts
and
into
the
state
courts
in
the
conflict
of
law
situations?
brother
ehrich
is
not
too
far
wrong
when
he
says
about
the
only
authority
on
it
are
things
like
biehl.
and
incidentally,
mr.
biehl
doesn't
think
much
of
the
rule.
he
refers
to
it
as
a
lot
of
chicanery
i
think.
and
cases
like
the
shafer-metro-goldwyn-mayer
which
is
as
dead
as
the
dodo
bird
in
its
own
state
just
as
the
mitcham
case,
it's
dead
as
the
dodo
bird
in
new
york
state.
that's
all
the
law
there
is
on
this
subject
or
just
about
all
the
law.
this
153
case
in
pennsylvania
where
for
some
reason,
they
couldn't
qualify
under
the
pennsylvania
act
and
with
that
opinion.
i
can't
understand
what
they
said,
but
i
know
what
they
did.
they
went
ahead
and
stayed
the
action.
but
more
or
less
by
analogy
to
what
they
would
have
done
if
their
own
act
applied
and
by
analogy
to
what
the
new
york
state
would
have
done.
but
we
think
if
this
court
and
i
don't
know
how
much
attention
people
would
pay
to
the
vermont
supreme
court
if
it
made
this
distinction,
but
we
think
if
this
court
identifies
the
new
york
agreement
embodying
as
it
does
in
this
statute
as
suspending
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
a
common
law
determination,
to
a
determination
of
the
common
law
courts
and
substituting
their
perspective
arbitration
award
as
their
right.
we
think
that
if
that
identification
of
the
contract
was
made,
then
all
these
conflict
of
jurisdiction
stuff
will
earn
itself
out.
everyone
can
then
think
in
terms
of
lex
loci
and
lex
fori
and
--
if
there's
no
more
trouble.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
the
lex
loci?
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
if
this
court
says
that
the
new
york
statute
means
what
it
says
that
these
things
are
enforceable
and
valid
and
revocable,
i'd
--
i
think
the
vermont
supreme
court
would
have
less
trouble
and
it
would
gone
in
on
a
declaratory
judgement.
now,
of
course
we
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
yes.
we
think
it
would
--
if
you
go
far
enough
to
make
--
as
if
you
identify
the
thing
strongly
enough
to
make
it
work
in
the
contract
of
law
--
in
the
conflict
of
law
context,
unaided
by
any
constitutional
requirements.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
well,
it
might
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
it
might
have
to
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
as
far
as
--
as
--
i
think
this
court
would
have
the
power
to
ascertain
vermont
law
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
and
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
if
the
statute
looks
after
everything
then
of
course
i
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
i
--
mr.
mcnamara
argued
that,
i
didn't.
fred
ehrich
have
presented
something
along
those
lines,
but
we
took
the
position
that
the
statute
was
all
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
that
was
the
position
we
took
there.
we
think
this
--
but
just
to
close
here,
we
think
that
this
stay
that
we
are
asking
for
is
not
the
new
york
contract
stay.
it's
a
plea
in
the
nature
of
a
plea
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
petitioner's
lawsuit
until
such
time
as
his
rights
are
fully
matured
by
obtaining
the
arbitration
award.
we
think
that's
the
thing
he
really
has
to
sue
on,
is
the
arbitration
award
when
and
if
he
gets
it.
and
that
our
plea
for
a
stay
is
--
is
merely
to
get
that
award.
there
is
a
couple
of
vermont
cases
where
they
say
that
the
proper
thing
for
a
court
to
do
is
to
stay
a
pending
action
or
is
to
stay
the
--
the
reported
action
when
there
is
another
pending
action
that's
going
to
get
rid
of
all
the
problems.
it's
going
to
make
everything
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel.
they
simply
stopped
that
second
action
and
awaiting
until
the
first
one
is
finished
and
they
do
that
by
a
stay
procedure.
so
--
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
yes,
sir?
mr.
guy
m.
page,
jr.
we
--
we
feel
exactly
the
same
way
here
we
did
about
section
3
in
the
circuit.
putting
aside
section
3,
we
think
this
thing
ought
to
be
entitled
a
full
faith
and
credit.
we
say
that
the
public
acts
of
new
york
are
so
much
an
integral
part
of
the
contract
that
the
--
that
the
contract
itself
is
entitled
a
full
faith
and
credit
in
vermont.
we
think
once
this
is
done
then
all
these
monkey
business
will
be
over
right
there
and
that's
--
that's
the
end
of
the
matter
right
there
and
no
more
problems.
so
that
is
our
main
position.
