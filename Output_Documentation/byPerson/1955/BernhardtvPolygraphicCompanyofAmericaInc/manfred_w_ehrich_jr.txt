mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
we
would
both
like
to
argue
and
if
it
suits
the
court's
convenience,
i
would
like
to
present
the
main
case
and
leave
the
rebuttal
to
my
partner,
mr.
clark.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
federal
arbitration
act
applies
or
whether
under
the
erie
doctrine,
the
state
law
applies
as
to
the
enforceability
of
an
arbitration
agreement
in
a
contract
which
had
to
do
with
an
intrastate
matter
and
which
is
before
this
court
purely
because
of
the
diversity
of
this
--
of
citizenship
of
the
parties.
the
contract
was
a
contract
by
which
mr.
bernhardt,
the
petitioner
here,
was
employed
by
polygraphic
company
as
a
plant
manager
in
vermont.
the
contract
was
drawn
in
new
york
by
the
attorneys
of
the
company
and
included
an
arbitration
agreement
drawn
with
the
new
york
law
in
mind
and
so
it
provided
that
it
should
be
interpreted
according
to
the
new
york
law.
suit
was
brought
in
vermont
because
mr.
bernhardt
was
fired
before
the
contract
had
ran
and
it
was
brought
in
the
state
court
and
was
removed
to
the
federal
district
court
on
the
ground
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
then
the
company
asked
for
a
stay
until
arbitration
had
been
had.
and
the
district
court
ruled
with
us
that
they
would
not
grant
a
stay
basing
their
decision
on
the
erie
doctrine
and
then
the
circuit
court
reversed
and
we
appealed
here.
there
was
--
arbitration
was
put
into
motion
by
the
company,
and
now
before
we
got
to
this
court,
we
had
to
have
the
circuit
court
stay
the
arbitration
pending
the
decision
here.
we
--
we
feel
that
this
is
a
plain
case
for
the
application
of
the
erie
doctrine.
and
we
feel
that
the
circuit
court
was
in
error
in
holding
that
there
was
no
substantive
right
here
in
the
erie
sense
of
which
of
course
is
different
from
the
normal
sense
of
substantive
as
against
procedural.
and
we
feel
that
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
circuit
court
do
not
support
the
decision
because
they
do
not
involve
our
situation.
the
erie
case
established
the
doctrine
that
under
the
judiciary
act,
the
unwritten
law
as
well
as
the
statutory
law
of
the
state
must
be
applied
in
a
diversity
case.
and
the
law
of
vermont
is
the
common
law
which,
as
we
have
briefed
and
as
the
other
side
has
conceded
below,
would
not
involve
the
enforcement
of
this
contract.
by
vermont
law,
an
arbitration
contract
is
not
illegal,
is
not
invalid
but
is
unenforceable.
so
that
if
the
parties
come
willingly
before
the
arbitration
board
then
arbitration
will
be
had
and
will
be
binding
but
neither
party
can
force
the
other
party
to
arbitrate
and
either
party
can
withdraw
at
anytime
until
the
award
is
made.
the
company
seems
to
rely
now
on
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
question
is
whether
the
--
one
of
the
questions
is
whether
the
federal
arbitration
act
applies
in
a
purely
diversity
case.
the
cases
were
the
federal
arbitration
act
has
been
applied
or
none
of
them
were
diversity
cases
in
the
sense
that
the
parties
were
before
the
court
purely
because
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
guaranty
trust
company
against
york
which
was
a
very
able
explanation
of
what
the
erie
case
intended
of
--
involve
the
new
york
statute
of
limitations.
and
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
although
the
statute
of
limitations
is
considered
to
be
procedural
under
the
common
law
definition
of
substance
and
procedure,
yet
it
must
be
applied
because
its
application
would
substantially
affect
the
result
of
the
case.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
case
were
allowed
--
is
allowed
to
proceed.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
if
they
had
not
removed,
your
honor,
in
vermont,
we
would
have
had
a
trial
about
a
year
ago,
jury
trial,
and
the
matter
would
have
been
disposed
of
long
since
and
the
--
the
cost
of
litigation
in
vermont
would
be
perhaps
$50.
if
we
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
they
would
be
determined
by
a
jury
in
vermont.
if
on
the
other
hand
we
have
to
arbitrate,
the
cost
is
substantially
higher.
the
bond
which
i
assumed
the
company
has
paid
is
$600.
the
delay
actually
is
greater
and
you
have
a
hearing
before
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
stated
from
as
in
the
--
the
objections
that
were
mentioned
by
you
in
the
wilco
case
really
don't
apply
here
because
we
do
not
have
a
jammed
court.
the
court
has
two
sessions,
six
months
each,
each
year
and
the
trial
work
that
is
ready
is
disposed
off
in
two
months
out
of
each
session
in
our
county
and
some
counties
that
takes
the
full
six
months.
but
if
there's
any
delay,
it's
because
the
counsel
of
parties
are
not
ready.
so
that
we
do
not
have
the
--
the
policy,
if
you
like,
the
economic
necessity
of
arbitration
in
vermont.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
and
without
the
rules
of
evidence
and
general
rules
that
apply
in
courts
and
do
not
apply
under
the
american
arbitration
association
rulings.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
my
understanding,
your
honor,
i've
never
been
involved
in
an
arbitration
case
before
but
my
understanding
is
that
your
review
is
limited
to
what
amounts
to
practically
misfeasance
on
the
part
of
the
arbitrators.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
under
this
agreement,
they
have
provided
the
rules
of
the
american
arbitration
association
should
apply
and
the
provisions
of
the
new
york
arbitration
law.
and
under
those
rules,
there's
no
record
kept,
the
witnesses
are
not
sworn
and
there's
just
no
--
as
far
as
i
can
see,
judicial
review
doesn't
amount
to
anything.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
the
contract
was
executed
in
new
york.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
the
papers
were
signed
in
new
york
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes.
the
provision
was
not
for
--
not
for
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
new
york
but
there
was
a
provision
that
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york
should
apply.
but
our
answer
to
that
is
that
the
cases
indicate
that
such
a
provision
is
no
stronger
than
a
provision
in
the
contract
which
simply
says,
“this
arbitration
agreement
shall
be
irrevocable.”
in
other
words,
where
a
court
would
not
enforce
a
direct
provision
line
that,
may
--
will
not
enforce
an
indirect
one
by
reference
to
the
laws
of
another
state.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
well,
no
it
isn't.
as
far
as
interpretation
of
the
contract
goes
as
i
understand
that
you
can
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
as
far
as
interpretation,
you
can
but
enforceability
is
a
different
thing.
the
validity
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
right.
you
could
--
cannot
buy
contract,
bind
the
vermont
court
to
apply
a
new
york
law
as
to
enforceability.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
it's
wider
than
that.
that
as
far
as
a
remedy
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
as
far
as
remedy
and
procedure
go,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
your
honor
[laughs]
it
is
remedy
according
to
judge
cardozo
in
the
mitcham
case
and
a
whole
lot
of
cases
that
have
followed
that
and
including
--
i
think
it
was
the
red
cross
case
here.
whether
it
is
a
procedure
in
the
common
law
sense
is
not
important.
it
is
--
it
is
substantive
in
the
sense
that
it
substantially
affects
the
result
and
yet
it
is
remedial
law
and
i
think
the
cases
are
unanimous
that
remedial
matters
are
governed
by
the
state
of
the
forum
and
the
law
of
forum
and
the
only
matters
of
validity
in
the
interpretation
are
governed
by
the
law
of
the
state
of
contracting.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
in
matter
of
gant
which
is
a
new
york
case
--
would
--
would
you
like
the
citation,
it's
in
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
--
both
briefs.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes.
that
was
a
north
carolina
contract
which
provided
for
arbitration
in
new
york
and
one
party
was
a
north
carolina
party,
the
other
one
came
from
south
america.
and
the
new
york
court
enforced
the
arbitration
where
both
parties
were
before
the
new
york
court
voluntarily
but
they
went
into
the
law
of
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
they
based
a
decision
not
on
the
fact
but
the
contract
draws
to
new
york
law
but
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
matter
of
remedy
and
was
governed
by
the
law
of
the
forum.
and
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
the
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
the
state
law.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
this
isn't
really
answering
your
question
but
of
course,
the
mitcham
case
which
was
the
grandfather
of
all
these
remedy
cases,
involved
a
pennsylvania
contract
which
was
attempted
to
be
enforced
in
new
york
prior
to
the
new
york
arbitration
act.
and
pennsylvania
have
an
arbitration
act
and
the
case
was
very
similar
to
what
we
have
here
and
that
was
where
they
decided
that
since
this
was
a
matter
of
remedy,
it
must
be
governed
by
the
law
of
new
york
regardless
of
what
the
contract
said.
now,
also
in
ohio,
there's
a
case
of
shafer
against
mgm
which
we
cited
where
the
contract
calls
for
the
enforcement
of
new
york
law.
and
that
case
is
direct
authority
that
the
law
of
the
forum
governs
regardless
of
what
law
the
parties
may
have
contracted
to
have
governed.
and
the
general
law
--
general
common
rule
is
expressed
in
that
case
that
you
cannot,
by
contract,
require
a
court
to
apply
the
law
of
another
state,
i
think
deal
also.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
--
as
a
matter
of
the
power
--
the
law
of
the
specific
states
should
govern
and
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
does
what
show?
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
the
record
shows
all
the
facts
and
as
far
as
the
withdrawal
is
concerned,
there
was
no
formal
withdrawal
but
the
bringing
of
an
action
amounts
to
withdrawal
from
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it's
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
perhaps
we
should
use
the
word
revoke
rather
than
withdrawal
because
the
action
was
begun
prior
to
the
commencement
of
arbitration.
in
other
words,
we
sued
in
vermont,
and
then
the
other
side
would
move
to
the
federal
court
and
substantially
at
the
same
time,
began
arbitration
in
new
york
and
then
moved
to
stay,
pending
the
conclusion
of
the
arbitration.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
the
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
so
that
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
it
would
take
place
before
the
american
arbitration
board,
and
they
have
an
office
in
new
york
and
--
and
one
in
boston,
and
they
have
provisions
in
their
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
no,
but
they
have
provisions
in
their
rules
for
sending
arbitrators
out
to
wherever
it
might
be.
and
i
assume
under
that
that
we
could
have
the
arbitration
in
vermont
which
would
be
more
convenient
for
both
parties.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
what
state
law
controls?
oh,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
vermont
state
law
definitely
does
control
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
our
authorities
for
that,
principally
new
york
cases.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
as
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
my
view
is,
your
honor,
that
on
the
--
that
what
you
really
have
to
decide
is
whether
this
case
comes
under
the
erie
doctrine.
and
if
it
comes
under
the
erie
doctrine
then
vermont
law
applies
and
the
--
the
only
way
to
get
to
that
--
to
the
new
york
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
question
what
the
vermont
--
what
law
the
vermont
courts
would
apply?
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
you
mean
on
the
matter
of
conflicts,
your
honor?
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
think
they
are.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
don't
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
we
can
help
you
sum
on
that.
as
far
as
the
actual
conflicts
question
goes,
there
is
virtually
no
vermont
law
order
but
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
vermont
has
always
been
a
common
law
state
and
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
conflicts
rule
as
far
as
common
law
goes
on
what
vermont
should
do
on
a
contract
that
was
executed
in
new
york
to
be
performed
anywhere,
provided
the
case
as
tried
in
vermont,
i
think
that
conflict
rule
is
decided
by
the
new
york
cases
of
the
mitcham
against
the
railroad,
of
matter
of
gant,
of
matter
of
(inaudible),
and
matter
of
berkowitz.
and
those
cases
all
hold
that
arbitration
is
a
matter
of
remedy,
and
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
and
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
no.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
distinction
there
is
the
distinction
drawn
in
the
guaranty
trust
case
that
what
you're
talking
about
is
whether
it
substantially
affects
the
result.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
it
helps
in
the
sense
that
it
means
that
vermont
law
rather
than
new
york
law
governs.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
that'
right.
that's
as
to
one
phase.
that
is
as
to
whether
the
state
law
or
federal
law
applies.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
then
once
you've
decided
that
state
law
applies,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
state
law?
and
in
vermont,
you're
pretty
much
thrown
back
to
--
well,
the
state
law
is
the
common
law.
and
then
the
next
question
is,
what
is
the
common
law?
and
that's
where
the
mitcham
case
and
the
cases
that
follow
it
establish
what
the
common
law
rule
is
that
would
be
enforced
in
vermont.
and
it's
rather
interesting
when
you
talk
about
possible
conflict
between
vermont
law
and
new
york
law,
that
even
where
new
york,
if
this
case
was
reversed
as
to
locations,
new
york
i
suppose
would
enforce
this
arbitration
agreement
under
the
new
york
statute.
but
the
reason
that
they
would
apply
that
statute
is
exactly
the
same
reason
that
we're
relying
on
here
for
not
applying
it
in
vermont.
in
other
words,
they
would
apply
it
because
the
case
was
in
new
york
and
because
it
was
a
matter
of
remedy.
that
was
held
in
every
one
of
the
cases
that
either
side
have
cited
it
from
new
york
even
--
even
in
the
cases
where
the
contract
call
for
application
of
new
york
--
of
new
york
law,
the
basis
of
the
decision
was
that
both
parties
were
voluntarily
before
the
new
york
court,
and
that
new
york
would
apply
its
own
law
as
to
this
matter
of
remedy.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
right
and
they
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
but
in
the
very
guaranty
case
itself,
the
statute
involved
was
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
that
as
you
said
in
your
decision
in
that
case
has
been
held
to
be
a
matter
of
procedure.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
right
and
i
say
the
same
thing
about
remedy
in
this
case.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
we
haven't
found
any
way
to
get
around
the
--
around
the
use
of
the
term
remedy.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that's
right
for
the
erie
purposes
but
you
were
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
but
you
also
have
the
question
of
whether
vermont
and
new
york
law
applies.
and
that
--
that's
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
relying
solely
on
new
york.
we
have
the
shafer
case
from
ohio,
and
then
there
are
quite
a
number
of
other
cases
involving
some
decisions
of
this
court
which
followed
that
same
principle.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
now
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
we
think
that
the
wilco
cases,
the
primary
answer
to
that,
that
it
certainly
does
substantially
affect
the
result.
and
i'd
like
to
read
just
a
few
lines
from
the
opinion.
this
court
there
said,
“in
unrestricted
submission
such
as
the
present
margin
agreements
envisage,
the
interpretations
of
the
law
by
the
arbitrators
in
contrast
to
manifest
disregard
are
not
subject
in
federal
courts
to
judicial
review
for
error
and
interpretation."
and
then
a
little
later,
they
went
on
and
referring
to
the
boyd
case,
they
said,
“we
said
in
that
case
that
the
right
to
select
the
forum
even
after
the
creation
of
a
liability
as
a
substantial
right
and
that
the
agreement
restricting
the
choice
would
forth
the
expressed
purpose
of
that
statute.”
now,
in
other
words,
i
interpret
that
as
meaning
that
in
a
situation
which
is
rather
similar,
this
right
to
choose
a
forum,
and
in
that
case
it
was
a
right
to
choose
between
a
court
of
law
and
arbitrators,
there's
a
substantial
right
in
the
guaranty
trust
sense.
and
for
that
reason,
the
court
in
that
case
refused
to
enforce
arbitration.
now,
in
your
dissent
there,
as
i
understand
it,
you
drew
an
analogy
between
the
speedy
trial
of
these
people
that
contracted
for
and
the
tortuous
conduct
of
cases
in
the
state
of
new
york
where
the
dockets
are
crowded.
and
in
vermont,
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
term
policy,
but
in
vermont
let
us
say
there
isn't
any
economic
necessity
for
substituting
this
arbitration
which
gives
you
sort
of
half
a
loaf,
but
faster
for
regular
trial
by
court
and
jury
with
all
the
rules
of
evidence
that
assure
a
correct
answer
but
take
longer.
actually,
in
vermont,
it
wouldn't
take
any
longer.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
i
was
really
simply
trying
to
distinguish
this
situation
from
--
from
your
dissent
in
that
case.
i'm
afraid
i'd
go
along
with
the
majority.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
satisfy
you
that
the
reasons
for
your
dissent
in
the
wilco
case
don't
apply
here.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
believe
we'd
have
to,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
not
after
this
court
decided
we
didn't.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
only
reason
that
we
would
have
to
go
before
the
arbitration
board
is
that
in
the
district
court,
the
company
which
is
quite
normal,
have
put
in
a
counterclaim
for
exactly
the
same
amount
as
our
client.
and
before
the
arbitration
board,
that
counterclaim
is
the
--
the
only
matter
at
issue
at
this
point,
unless
we
go
in
and
present
our
side.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
now,
the
result
would
be
if
we
ignore
it
that
under
the
new
york
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
either
that
or
have
a
default
judgment
against
us
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
--
which
would
then
be
enforceable
in
the
new
york
courts.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
by
analogy
to
these
new
york
cases,
i
think
if
we
appeared
before
the
arbitration
commission,
we'd
be
in
the
same
position
as
if
both
parties
had
voluntarily
appeared
before
the
new
york
court.
and
in
other
words,
we'd
be
submitting
ourselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
new
york
and
--
and
so
then
the
law
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
well,
i'm
not
sure
but
i
think
we'd
be
stuck
with
it.
the
--
the
contract
provided
for
the
jurisdiction
of
the
new
york
courts.
and
whether
that
would
carry
over
to
the
arbitration
board
or
not,
i
don't
know.
but
the
--
it
didn't
provide
the
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
it
didn't
provide
for
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
new
york
courts.
and
as
i
understand
that
provision,
it
simply
means
that
if
either
party
goes
before
the
new
york
court,
the
other
party
will
be
bound
by
the
decision.
but
in
this
case,
both
parties
went
into
the
vermont
court
and
that
question
hasn't
arisen.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
it
did
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
i
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
you
really
have
to
read
a
string
of
cases
there.
after
the
mitcham
case,
there
was
berkowitz
case
where
they
had
a
very
interesting
situation
of
two
contracts
providing
for
arbitration.
both
contracts
made
before
the
statute
was
enacted
and
an
action
on
one
of
them
was
begun
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
and
the
other
was
begun
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
and
in
that
case,
cardozo
held
that
this
thing
being
a
matter
of
remedy,
that
they
would
enforce
arbitration
in
the
second
case
because
the
lawsuit
was
begun
after
the
action,
after
the
statute
was
passed,
but
they
would
not
enforce
it
in
their
first
case.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
is
that
in
the
mitcham
case,
the
substantive
law
of
ohio
where
the
contract
was
drawn
--
i
think
the
contract
was
drawn
in
ohio
for
performance
and
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
both
parties
were
pennsylvania
parties
and
performance
was
to
be
in
pennsylvania.
and
well,
they
wanted
to
enforce
the
pennsylvania
statute
at
any
rate.
as
i
understand
that,
his
theory
was
that
since
this
was
a
matter
of
--
of
remedy,
the
law
of
the
forum
applied.
and
if
it
had
been
a
matter
of
--
of
substance,
then
the
law
either
at
the
place
of
performance
or
of
contracting
would
apply.
i'm
not
sure
which.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
you
get
to
the
conflict
between
performance
and
where
the
contract
was
made
because
i
think
that
the
rule
that
governs
here
is
where
the
lawsuit
is
brought.
and
that
this
is
a
matter
of
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
and
i
think
there's
a
distinction,
your
honor,
between
remedial
matters
and
substantive
matters.
and
i
think
that
that's
the
generally
accepted
common
law,
and
i
think
that
this
mitcham
case
is
one
of
the
leading
cases
on
the
question
of
--
of
that
rule
as
applied
to
arbitration.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
true,
and
i
think
that
i
like
the
erie
doctrine
for
that
reason.
and
the
--
under
the
erie
doctrine,
i
feel
quite
confident
that
the
federal
court
must
apply
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
it
sets.
and
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
the
conduct
of
its
own
business
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
--
and
that's
under
the
--
is
it
the
cohen
case?
i'm
sorry
if
you
got
a
little
confused.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
i
had
said
they
did
have
to.
in
the
cohen
case,
the
court
said
what
the
erie
railroad
company
v.
tompkins,
and
its
progeny
have
brought
a
far
reaching
change
in
the
relation
of
state
and
federal
court
in
the
application
of
state
law
in
the
latter
whereby
in
diversity
cases,
the
federal
court
administers
the
state
system
of
law
in
all
except
details
relating
to
its
own
conduct
of
business.
and
they
held
in
that
case
that
the
state
law
requiring
the
stockholders
to
file
a
bond
would
be
enforced.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
that's
a
tough
proposition.
the
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
the
only
case
--
the
only
federal
case
that
really
has
to
do
with
arbitration
is
titus
against
(inaudible)
where
they
enforced
texas
law
to
the
exclusion
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
that's
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
i
believe
so.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
no
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
i
think
that
once
they
reach
the
point
where
they
--
where
it
makes
a
substantial
difference,
where
it
--
in
other
words,
where
it's
a
matter
of
--
of
policy
in
the
federal
courts,
as
i
understand
that
that's
what
you
set
out
that
it's
a
matter
of
policy
in
the
federal
courts
that
they
will
not
enforce
arbitration.
i
believe
that
under
the
guaranty
case,
clearly,
they
would
have
to
grant
a
stay
and
enforce
the
state
law
because
it
would
substantially
affect
the
outcome.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
this
is
a
case
where
jurisdiction
is
based
solely
on
diversity,
and
the
theory
is
that
the
choice
of
forum,
if
you
like,
determines
what
law
shall
apply
on
these
matters.
and
i
think
that
they
definitely
would,
under
the
guaranty
case,
enforce
arbitration.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
this
is
a
matter
of
--
of
full
faith
and
credit.
the
--
the
shafer
case,
which
is
the
only
case
we
found
directly
on
it,
held
that
a
provision
on
a
contract
that
the
law
of
new
york,
and
it
did
involve
the
new
york
arbitration
act,
would
apply,
had
no
more
weight
than
if
the
people
involved
in
the
contract
had
provided
that
this
arbitration
agreement
shall
be
irrevocable
and
enforceable.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
i
think
it
--
well,
i
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
think
there
is
but
i
don't
think
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
length
of
--
of
offensive.
what
vermont
does
is
they
leave
the
parties
in
this
situation.
they
make
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
if
both
parties
want
to
arbitrate,
and
the
award
is
granted,
then
they
will
enforce
the
award,
but
they
will
not
enforce
an
unwilling
party
to
give
up
the
right
to
the
protection
of
the
legal
rules.
and
then
it's
in
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
in
that
sense
i
think
you're
entirely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
would
say
what,
your
honor?
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
oh,
no.
no,
we're
talking
only
about
arbitration
agreements.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
because
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
in
vermont
we
feel
that
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
that
you're
entitled
to
the
regular
court
procedures,
and
we
do
not
have
any
situation
such
as
you
do
in
new
york
where
people
are
justified
in
casting
aside
those
protections
in
order
to
get
a
somewhat
less
reliable
answer
faster.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
so
that
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well
--
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
so.
mr.
manfred
w.
ehrich,
jr.
that's
correct
and
because
it
can
be
changed
by
a
legislation
as
the
necessity
comes
up
in
each
state
and
has
been.
