justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
difference
between
this
so
far
as
the
result
is
concerned,
the
actual
difference
is
that
this
was
in
vermont
state
court.
get
a
trial
before
a
judge
and
jury
on
the
common
law
procedure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
is,
you
have
a
trial
by
arbitration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
any
jury
and
without
any
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
policy
to
the
contrary
in
vermont?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
policy
seems
to
be
that
--
in
vermont
a
man
who
wants
a
court
trial
and
a
jury
decided
to
get
unless
he
waives
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
valid
on
all
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
the
equitable
life
insurance
company
would
have
put
that
provision
and
all
its
policies.
would
that
be
binding
in
all
the
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i
meant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
meant
for
the
whole
provision
with
reference
to
the
right
to
sue
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
right
to
arbitrate
instead
of
sue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
--
as
i
recall
it
because
that
was
limited
to
contact
of
a
certain
type
made
by
a
certain
kind
of
association
where
they
kind
of
bound
together
in
a
invisible
bond
of
brotherly
love
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
contract
made
by
fraternal
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
emphasize
what
the
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
i
recalled
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i
remember
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
argument
that
you've
been
making
as
part
of
that
here
a
moment
ago,
pointed
in
the
direction
of
--
of
the
belief
that
the
law
of
new
york
with
reference
to
this
contract
has
to
be
followed
by
vermont
whether
it
wishes
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
--
the
position
that
you
were
making
a
while
ago
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
i
understood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
you
concede
--
if
it
be
conceded
that
the
law
of
vermont
does
govern
and
that
the
law
of
vermont
is
against
arbitration,
is
it
your
position
that
the
district
court
could
ignore
that
fact
and
submit
--
require
that
matter
to
be
submitted
to
arbitration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
would
--
what
do
you
say
in
that
connection
to
this
statement
in
guaranty
trust
company
versus
new
york?
because
it
--
it
gets
down
to
the
issue
that
i
have
in
mind.
de
novo
the
policies
that
underlies
erie
verus
tompkins
is
that
for
the
same
transaction,
the
accident
of
a
suit
by
a
non-resident
litigant
in
the
federal
court
instead
of
in
a
state
court
to
block
away,
should
not
lead
to
a
substantially
different
result.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
not
this
leave
to
a
substantially
different
result?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
because
they
would
be
compelled
to
do
it
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
oh
that's
how
--
well,
forgetting
that
for
the
moment
and
saying
that
the
erie
and
tompkins
doctrine
governs.
and
that
the
law
of
the
--
the
court
can
undoubtedly
enforce
its
own
policy
there
if
it's
in
a
state
court,
that
in
a
state
court.
do
you
claim
that
the
federal
court
under
the
erie
and
tompkins
doctrine
would
not
be
required
to
follow
that
same
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
i
--
and
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
argument,
but
now
let's
assume
that
it
would
not
be
imported
by
the
state
court.
do
you
have
any
argument
to
say
that
this
wouldn't
be
within
the
category
of
the
type
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
after
that
latter,
the
federal
court
would
have
to
follow
the
state
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
deny
arbitration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
john
hancock
mutual
is
before
you
encompass?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
other
didn't
--
didn't
confer
erie
and
tompkins
did
it?
what
--
it
wasn't
based
on
erie
and
tompkins
doctrine
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
deals
something
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
it
cast
our
criteria
and
it's
--
is
what
i
have
just
read
to
you
that
the
federal
court
must
follow
the
procedure
of
the
state
court,
where
failure
to
do
so
would
lead
to
a
substantially
different
result.
would
it
be
your
position
that
this
wouldn't
lead
to
a
substantially
different
result?
justice
hugo
l.
black
perhaps
in
new
york,
has
there
ever
been
a
case
in
vermont
since
the
beginning
of
its
history
in
which
it
has
sustained
an
agreement
made
in
that
state
between
parties
which
ousted
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
any
extent
to
federal
controversies
by
lawsuits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
--
has
there
ever
been
any
contract
sustained
in
vermont
which
where
the
parties
agreed
to
change
the
rules
of
evidence
in
the
court
of
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
burden
of
proof.
the
burden
of
proof
or
anything
like
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
just
wondered
if
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
judge
--
and
judge
gibson
held,
did
he,
that
they
could
not
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[laughs]
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
erie
v.
tompkins.
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
--
you
said
that
vermont
has
believed
in
keeping
a
contract
which
i
think
is
great.
but
do
they
believe
in
keeping
contacts
there
made
between
parties
which
oust
the
court
of
a
jurisdiction
to
try
their
lawsuit
once
the
controversy
arises?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
basis
they
admit
on
which
they
declined
to
recognize
arbitration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
vermont
agreement
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
based
on
the
argument
they
had
a
right
to
have
a
trial
in
this
court
according
to
the
rules
of
evidence
and
by
jury,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i'm
not
talking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
your
constitution
provide
about
trials
by
jury?
does
it
make
any
provision
on
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
thinking
about
the
policy
of
the
state,
isn't
it?
that's
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
have
on
whose
consent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
i
understood
from
both
of
you,
which
probably
the
rule
today
with
reference
to
arbitration.
namely,
as
the
parties
came
into
court
and
agreed
to
arbitrate,
they
could
arbitrate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
at
that
time
after
the
lawsuit
is
filed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
they
couldn't
make
the
agreement
in
advance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
yes,
i
understand
it
fine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
couldn't
do
it,
could
he,
if
he
agrees
after
the
lawsuit
starts
and
go
into
the
judges.
i
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
are
very
clear
on
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
those
are
very
clear
always,
you
think,
easy
to
find
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
judge
gibson,
as
i
read
his
opinion,
he
squarely
decided
that
this
particular
contract
which
was
made
in
new
york
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
these
parties
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
not
enforceable
under
vermont
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
agreement
was
he
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
made
in
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
are
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly,
he
didn't
mention
it
in
is
his
opinion
but
when
he
held
on
page
17
that
there
was
no
statutory
law
governing
arbitration,
common
law
must
apply.
the
common
law
is
an
agreement
to
submit
an
issue
of
arbitration
is
not
binding,
it
is
not
revocable
at
anytime
and
then
enforce
this.
he
was
enforcing
this
particular
contract
made
in
new
york.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
had
to
do
that
because
he
gave
his
second
question
--
he
is
deciding
upon
it
of
that
and
be
contracted
to
a
just
contracted
dispute
by
arbitration
and
then
you
said
they
haven't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
held
that
the
erie
and
tompkins
doctrine
didn't
apply?
