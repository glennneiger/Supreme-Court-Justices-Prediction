mr.
walter
j.
rockler
yes,
sir.
if
it
please
the
court.
i
am
appearing
for
the
petitionrs
sears,
roebuck
and
his
company.
it
is
agreeable
to
the
court,
i
propose
to
reserve
about
10
minutes
of
my
allotted
time.
this
case
rises
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
denied
a
motion
to
dismiss
an
appeal.
the
motion
was
taken
from
an
order
of
the
trial
court,
the
district
court
to
dismiss
parts
of
a
complaint.
that
is
the
appeal
that
was
taken.
the
motion
of
the
petitioner,
sorted
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
of
a
lack
of
the
--
of
meeting
the
requirements
of
section
1291
of
the
judicial
code.
the
court
of
appeals
below,
relying
upon
the
fact
that
an
order
in
the
form
of
rule
54
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
had
been
entered
by
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
consider
whether
or
not
the
requirements
of
section
1291
were
met
undependable.
we
believe
that
the
court
below,
errored
in
its
interpretation
of
rule
54
(b)
and
misjudged
the
relationship
of
the
federal
rule,
the
section
1291
of
judicial
code.
the
background
of
this
matter
in
detail
is
as
follows.
the
respondents,
an
individual
and
a
corporation
wholly
controlled
by
the
individual
respondent,
filed
a
complaint
in
the
six
counts
against
the
petitioner.
count
i
set
forth
the
allege
violations
of
the
sherman,
clayton
and
robinson-patman
act
and
demanded
travel
damages
cost
and
permanent
equitable
relief.
this
was
the
general
antitrust
count.
count
i
in
a
specific
allegation
stressed
the
size
and
power
of
the
petitioner,
sears,
and
charged
that
the
petitioner
had
committed
a
series
of
individual
wrong
or
tort
against
the
respondents.
the
count
i
also
charged
that
he
was
--
these
were
a
part
of
a
very
general
plan
to
drive
the
petitioner
out
of
all
businesses
now
and
in
the
future.
thus,
paragraph
11
of
count
i
alleged,
"beginning
in
1949
and
continuing
down
to
the
date
of
the
filling
of
this
complaint,
sears
has
been
engaged
in
a
continuing
attempt
to
destroy
each
and
every
business
owned,
controlled,
or
managed
by
mackey.
and
thereby,
to
punish
mackey
for
refusing
to
deal
with
sears
on
terms
dictated
by
sears
and
to
deter
others
from
refusing
to
deal
with
sears
on
terms
dictated
by
sears.
after
several
paragraphs
of
allegations
with
respect
to
specific
wrong,
paragraph
22,
more
or
less,
have
the
same
thing.
all
of
the
four
set
acts
and
practices
have
been
performed
by
sears
pursuant
to
its
continuing
plan
to
destroy
each
and
every
business
in
which
mackey
has
engaged
or
may
attempt
to
engage.
in
the
subsequent
counts
by
re-alleging
the
counts,
the
allegations
of
count
i
singly
or
in
combination,
the
respondents
purported
to
multiply
their
clauses
of
actions
or
claims
with
respect
to
the
number
of
laws
violated,
the
claims
themselves
and
of
course
the
amount
of
damages.
count
ii,
thus,
based
almost
entirely
on
cross
references
to
specific
paragraphs
of
count
i
alleged
unfair
competition
by
the
petitioner
with
a
lamp
business
conducted
by
the
respondent.
count
iii,
similarly
based
on
cross
references
to
count
i,
charged
interference
with
profitable
contractual
relation
to
the
respondent.
count
iv,
similarly
established
by
cross
reference
to
count
i,
alleged
unfair
competition
and
we
believe
a
possible
patent
infringement
with
respect
to
a
tool
business
conducted
by
the
respondents.
count
v,
which
originally
charged
robinson-patman
the
antitrust
violations
was
abandoned
by
the
respondent.
count
vi,
which
substantially
reincorporated
all
of
the
fact
to
the
allegations
of
the
forgoing
counts,
charged
an
overall
general
tort
of
an
attempt
to
destroy
all
businesses
of
the
respondent.
again,
count
vi
was
based
upon
the
notion
of
a
plan
linking
together
all
of
the
specific
episodes
charged
in
paragraphs
to
count
i.
upon
the
petitioner's
motion
in
the
trial
court
as
amended
to
dismiss
parts
of
the
complaint,
the
trial
court
did
dismiss
count
i,
ii
and
part
of
count
vi
without
lead
to
amend.
the
parties
are
thus
now
that
issue
in
the
trial
court
on
counts
iii,
iv
and
the
remaining
part
of
count
vi.
the
order
of
dismissal
by
the
district
court
took
the
form
of
an
order
under
rule
54
(b)
as
amended
of
the
federal
rule,
that
is
to
say
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
just
reason
for
delay
and
directed
the
entry
of
its
judgment.
the
petitioner,
thereafter,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeals,
which
set
on
the
ground,
that
statutory
finality.
a
final
decision
in
the
sense
of
section
1291
of
the
judicial
code
was
lacking,
not
withstanding
the
entry
of
judgment
from
the
form
of
rule
54
(b).
this
motion
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
solely
and
exclusively
upon
the
ground
that
the
district
court's
order
entered
in
accordance
with
rule
54
(b)
forms
was
conclusive
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
should
be
noted
that
briefs
were
filed
by
both
parties,
an
extensive
argument
was
held
in
the
circuit
court
upon
two
issues.
the
first
issue
was
as
to
the
effect
of
rule
54
(b)
order,
was
it
necessarily
final
for
appeals'
purposes.
this
is
a
question
of
interpretation
as
the
question
of
relationship
of
the
rule
to
the
jurisdictional
statute.
if
the
court
found
that
a
rule
54
(b)
order
was
not
final
necessarily
in
the
jurisdictional
sense,
a
second
question
was
presented
in
the
circuit.
that
question
was
whether,
in
--
in
the
light
of
the
construction
of
1291
which
this
court
and
other
courts
have
given,
whether
the
decision
dismissing
parts
of
the
complaint
in
the
court
below
was
final
under
1291.
that
is
a
question
entirely
apart
from
rule
54
(b).
now,
reviewing
the
conflicting
decisions
in
a
various
circuits,
as
to
the
effect
of
rule
54
(b),
the
court
of
appeals
below
decided
that
an
order
entered
in
accordance
with
its
form
was
controlling
an
appellate
jurisdiction,
thus,
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
the
second
question
which
had
been
argued
their
finality
in
the
1291
sense.
in
its
decision,
the
court
accepted
the
views
of
a
majority
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
bendix
aviation
company
versus
glass
case
and
the
views
of
a
panel
of
the
second
circuit
in
pabellon
case,
pabellon
versus
grace
line.
these
cases
have
been
extensively
cited
in
both
briefs.
the
court
below
recognized
that
this
interpretation
of
rule
54
(b)
to
use
its
own
words
"automatically
and
conclusively"
fixed
appellate
jurisdiction
in
accordance
with
the
direction
of
the
district
court
judge.
also,
the
court
construed
the
opinion
of
judge
clark
on
this
question
in
the
pabellon
case
which
opinion
it
adopted.
to
the
effect
of
that,
"a
final
order
under
rule
54
(b)
relieved
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
task
of
making
an
independent
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
order
was,
in
fact,
final
and
appealable."
in
view
of
its
decision,
as
i've
said,
the
court
below
explicitly
refused
the
pass
upon
the
question
whether
the
elements
of
statutory
finality
required
by
section
1291
were
present
in
the
dismissal
order
of
the
trial
court
judge.
in
this
court,
we
believe
the
issue
is
simpler.
it
can
be
stated
as
one
or
two
issues.
as
two
issues,
the
first
question
is
whether
an
order
on
one
or
more
claims
in
a
multiple
claims
case,
complying
in
the
form
with
rule
54
(b)
automatically
becomes
appealable
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
a
second
issue
which
we
think
is
closely
related
to
the
first
is
whether
rule
54
(b)
is
interpreted
to
reach
this
result
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
did,
whether
the
rule
is
then
valid
in
view
of
the
congressional
requirements
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
set
forth
in
1291.
now,
we
think
the
second
question
is
illusory
that
is
to
say
the
validity
of
the
rule
because
it's
our
view
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
rule
54
(b)
is
that
it
does
not
confer
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
the
question
here
is
different
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
it
before
two
questions,
namely,
the
effective
rule
54
(b),
and
secondarily,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
judgment
in
the
trial
court
was
final.
they
bypassed
the
second
question
entirely
by
their
construction
of
rule
54
(b).
and
i
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
their
interpretation
of
rule
54
(b)
was
supported
(inaudible)
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
--
that
the
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
it
did
but
the
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
sir.
but
i
think
as
--
as
i
would
try
to
indicate
hereafter,
the
word
"final"
in
the
rule
as
an
all
together
a
different
meaning
in
the
word
final
in
section
1291.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
the
question
of
--
of
what
the
word
final
means
under
1291
under
the
facts
of
this
case
is
a
different
question.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
let
me
--
let
me
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
right,
right.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
let
me
say
--
in
my
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
but
the
question
with
respect
to
rule
54
(b),
i
think,
is
the
same
question.
i
think
this
court
does
not
have
before
it
the
--
the
independent
question
of
whether
or
not
under
section
1291
apart
from
rule
54
(b).
there
was
a
final
judgment
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that's
right
--
if
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
--
i
think
that's
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice.
in
other
words,
if
this
--
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
court
of
appeals
below,
it
does
in
effect
said
that
final
in
the
two
--
in
the
rule
and
the
statute
mean
the
same
thing
and
there
is
no
further
question.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
but
if
it
--
if
--
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
court
below,
there
is
no
question
under
1291.
if
this
court
did
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
if
it
doesn't
agree,
then
there
remains
the
question
in
this
case
of
whether
or
not
the
order
in
the
trial
court
was
final
under
1291.
now,
that
is
a
question
which
has
been
argued
in
the
brief
extensively
in
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
court
refused
to
pass
upon
the
issue
because
it
thought
it
was
unnecessary.
and
we
have,
therefore,
in
order
not
to
avoid
that
question
requested
that
it
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
below.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
this
court
can
reach
that
question.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
--
the
--
the
court
has
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that
is
what
we
--
that's
what
we've
recommended
and
proposed
to
this
court.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
--
is
--
lies
in
the
grant
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
believe
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
construction
to
be
given
to
rule
54
(b).
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
you'll
find
that
under
the
petition
for
certiorari,
there
was
no
question
presented
to
this
court
as
to
how
1291
applies.
now,
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
mr.
justice,
i
think
that's
entirely
correct.
that's
what
we've
asked.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
now,
in
our
reply
brief,
we
set
forth
the
reasons
why
we
believe
that
question
is
more
properly
before
the
court
of
appeals.
the
argument
for
the
petitioner
here
under
rule
54
(b)
question
can
be
summarized
very
briefly.
section
1291
which
sets
forth
the
requirements
for
appellate
jurisdiction
and
has
been
a
part
of
the
judicial
code,
i
think,
since
this
--
far
back
in
1789,
state
the
following,
the
court
of
appeals
shall
have
jurisdiction
of
appeals
from
all
final
decisions
of
the
district
court,
then
i
omit
a
part,
except
where
direct
view
--
where
direct
review
may
be
held
in
the
supreme
court.
this
section
is
the
implementing
section
reflecting
a
--
a
long-standing
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals.
such
appeals
are
barred
because
they
tend
to
fragmentized
litigation
because
the
important
thing
in
--
upon
appeals
conserve
the
time
and
energy
of
the
appellate
court
rather
than
the
serve
the
convenience
of
the
trial
court.
the
rule
is
intended
to
make
sure
that
litigation
comes
up
at
a
matured
stage.
it's
intended
to
make
sure
that
the
appellate
court
has
perspective
with
respect
for
the
litigation.
and
to
some
extent,
it's
intended
to
prevent
appeals
whereby
the
development
of
litigation,
a
matter
may
become
moot
or
subtle.
historically
and
consistently,
section
1291
has
required
two
different
things.
the
first
thing
required
has
been
that
there
be
a
final
disposition
of
a
subject
matter
by
the
trial
court.
now,
this
is
a
requirement
of
internal
finality,
finality
in
the
sense
that
trial
court
has
finished
with
the
subject
matter.
it
has
reserved
nothing.
it's
gone
as
far
as
it
will.
the
court
has
exhausted
its
will
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter.
the
second
requirement,
and
this
lies
well
outside
the
scope
of
any
rule
of
the
district
court
procedure,
is
that
the
matter
disposed
of
by
the
trial
court,
the
matter
which
is
internally
final,
must
be
a
distinct
judicial
unit.
it
must
separate
and
independent
of
other
manners
remaining
to
be
decided
by
the
trial
court.
neither
rule
54
nor
indeed
any
district
court
rule
can
do
more
than
establish
the
existence
of
the
first
element,
internal
finality.
that
is
a
final
disposition
by
the
trial
court
judge.
that
is
what
the
rule
is
talking
about.
for
convenience,
we
refer
to
this
as
internal
finality.
rule
54
(b)
cannot
and
does
not
purport
to
bind
the
hands
of
the
appellate
court
in
determining
external
finality
whether
an
appropriate
quantum
of
litigation
has
been
concluded,
but
differently,
whether
the
decision
discloses
of
a
separate
and
distinct
matter
arising
from
a
separate
and
distinct
transaction
or
occurrence.
as
judge
hastie
has
put
these
two
requirements
of
section
1291
in
the
bendix
case,
"two
things
are
necessary
for
a
final
decision.
the
district
court
must
take
all
the
steps
necessary
to
complete
its
action
with
reference
to
the
claim.
and
in
addition,
the
subject
matter
litigated
must
have
enough
scope
to
satisfy
the
statutory
conception
of
final
decision."
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
for
the
district
court,
practice
and
procedure
in
the
district
court
were
governed
largely
by
the
conformity
act
which
looked
at
the
state
practice
and
procedure.
at
that
time,
generally,
such
practice
and
procedure
did
not
recognize
a
liberal
joinder
of
claims.
ordinarily,
you
could
not
combine
equitable
and
legal
complaints.
third
party
practice
was
severely
restricted.
as
a
result
of
the
forms
of
pleading
and
practice
prior
to
the
federal
rules,
the
general
rule
under
section
1291,
the
jurisdictional
section,
was
sometimes
stated
to
be
that
the
judgment
in
question
must
dispose
of
all
issues
as
to
all
parties.
even
before
the
federal
rules,
however,
in
those
relatively
rare
cases
under
the
practice
and
procedure
which
prevail
them,
different
matters
were
combined
in
the
same
action.
in
such
cases,
partial
judgments
were
sometimes
recognized
to
be
final
in
the
appellate
sense.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
case
of
united
states
versus
river
rouge.
with
the
introduction
of
the
federal
rules,
new
conditions
of
practice
could
be
anticipated.
it
was
a
liberal
joinder
of
actions,
equitable
and
legal
actions
could
be
freely
joined,
the
third
party
practice
was
loosened
up.
as
a
result,
it
could
now
be
anticipated
that
what
before
was
an
unusual
situation
might
now
become
common.
that
is,
that
different
claims
and
separate
clauses
of
action
might
be
united
with
a
single
pleading.
original
rule
54
(b)
provided
as
a
rule
of
district
court
procedure
that
the
trial
judge
could
enter
a
judgment
upon
one
of
several
claims.
the
rule
had
no
particular
reference
to
appellate
jurisdiction
nor
was
there
any
such
intention
on
the
part
of
the
--
its
draftsman.
it
was
not
construed
in
the
courts
to
affect
appellate
jurisdiction.
the
rule
was
held
valid
by
this
court
in
reeves
versus
beardall,
a
decision
which,
i
believe,
occasioned
no
great
surprise.
in
reeves
versus
beardall,
the
plaintiff
filed
a
three-count
complaint.
first
count
was
upon
rights
on
a
promissory
note.
the
second
count
was
a
count
under
a
contract
to
maintain
certain
will
provisions.
the
third
count
was
a
count
for
money
damages
against
the
third
party.
the
second
and
third
counts
were
dismissed
in
the
trial
court.
it
was
held
in
this
court
and
the
courts
below
that
the
order
was
final
as
to
the
dismissal
of
the
second
and
third
counts
because
those
counts
dealt
with
matters
which
were
separate
and
distinct
from
the
remaining
count,
the
promissory
note
count.
and
each
count
arose
out
of
a
subject
matter
wholly
and
distinct,
wholly
separate
and
distinct.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
--
i
think
that's
entirely
correct.
but
i
think
there
was
also
a
question
there,
mr.
justice,
as
--
as
to
whether
or
not
the
dismissal
of
two
counts
with
the
retention
of
a
third
was
possible
under
the
generally
stated
proposition
as
to
section
1291
that
all
issues
and
all
parties
had
to
be
satisfied.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
i
agree
and
that
--
that
is
the
position
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
agree
with
that
entirely.
that's
exactly
the
position
we
take
with
respect
to
reeves.
the
respondents
in
their
brief
have
repeatedly
and
instantly
maintained
that
the
reeves
case
and
the
second
circuit
position
in
collins
versus
metro-goldwyn-mayer
marked
the
great
change
in
the
interpretation
of
a
requirements
of
1291
because
of
the
introduction
of
the
federal
rules.
they
go
further.
they
also
maintained
that
as
a
result
of
the
reeves
and
beardall
decision,
authority
has
been
given
to
vary
appellate
jurisdiction
in
accordance
with
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
namely,
there
is
authority
to
give
the
effect
to
the
amended
rule
which
the
court
below
didn't
give.
i
might
say
that
the
position
of
the
respondent's
on
the
effect
of
the
reeves
case
that
flatly
contradicted
by
judge
clark
on
the
second
circuit
court,
a
judge
whose
views
in
this
area
are
otherwise
strongly
recommended
by
the
respondents.
in
the
audi
vision
case
versus
rca,
decided
two
years
after
the
reeves
and
collins
cases,
judge
clark
pointed
out
that
rule
54
(b)
is
and
i
quote
him,"
essentially,
nothing
more
than
the
pre-existing
rule
and
equity
providing
for
split
judgments
and
extended
cases.
it
merely
enforces
what
previously
had
been
termed
an
exemption
for
matters
distinct
from
the
general
subject
of
the
litigation."
the
judge
then
went
on
to
say,
"this
must
necessarily
be
told
because
the
rules
do
not
affect
jurisdiction
or
deal
with
the
powers
of
appellate
courts."
the
reeves
case,
in
our
view,
marked
no
change
in
the
statutory
test.
even
if
they
had
marked
some
change,
the
reeves
case
is
hardly
authority
for
an
amendment
which
allegedly
grants
discretion
to
the
trial
judge,
to
decide
whether
to
create
appellate
jurisdiction.
as
this
court
said
recently
in
baltimore
contractors
verus
bodinger,
piecemeal
appeals
will
not
be
permitted
in
the
discretion
of
a
trial
judge
upon
a
finding
of
need.
i'd
like
to
turn
the
collins
versus
m.g.m.,
which
is
stressed
again
by
the
respondents
on
this
issue.
they
maintained
the
decision
there,
marked
the
power
of
the
federal
rules
to
alter
conceptions
under
section
1291.
in
the
collins
case,
a
complaint
was
brought
in
two
counts.
the
first
alleged
copyright
infringement
and
the
second
alleged
unfair
competition
in
appropriating
the
title
of
a
book.
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
first
count
was
granted
and
the
question
was
whether
that
dismissal
was
a
final
order
in
the
statutory
sense.
the
court
held
that
that
order
was
final
because
the
transactions
involved
in
the
first
and
second
counts
was
separate
and
different.
the
collins
case
did
have
the
effect
in
the
second
circuit
of
reversing
some
prior
decisions.
however,
the
reversal
was
not
a
product
necessarily
of
the
introduction
of
the
federal
rules.
the
second
circuit
in
the
collins
case
clearly
points
out
that
it
is
bringing
its
views
into
line
with
those
of
several
other
circuit
court
opinions
and
the
supreme
court.
and
i
refer
to
the
eight
or
nine
circuit
court
cases
and
supreme
court
cases
cited
in
the
collins
as
a
precedent
for
its
decision.
all
of
these
cases
are
pre-rules
cases
and
they
can
hardly
indicate
the
effect
of
the
rule
to
change
the
interpretation
under
section
1291.
to
demonstrate
how
little
the
collins'
results
depended
upon
the
federal
rules.
i'd
like
to
take
one
of
those
cases
as
an
example.
that's
klever
versus
seawall,
it
arose
in
1894,
involved
a
three-count
complaint.
the
first
count
was
an
action
for
rejectment,
the
second
count
was
a
count
for
trusts
with
damages,
and
the
third
count
was
a
count
for
petition.
judgment
was
rendered
for
the
plaintiff
on
all
counts
by
default
but
with
respect
to
counts
two
and
three,
further
action
remained
to
be
taken.
therefore,
no
sense
could
the
order
with
respect
to
counts
two
and
three
be
final.
however,
the
court
held
that
the
circuit
court
of
ohio
in
1894,
that
the
judgment
on
the
first
count
was
final.
there
was
no
reason
to
delay
the
appeal
when
the
subject
matter
had
been
finally
disposed
of
and
was
unrelated
to
other
counts.
we
submit
that
this
result
is
very
similar
to
the
result
in
collins
versus
m.g.m.
similarly,
(inaudible)
a
fourth
circuit
court
case
decided
in
1904,
four
counts
were
represented.
three
counts
--
three
of
the
four
counts
were
dismissed
and
the
court
found
that
these
counts
were
sufficiently
unrelated
to
the
remaining
count
that
a
final
order
could
be
entered
with
respect
to
them.
and
one
of
the
principle
problems
under
the
original
rule
54
(b)
was
the
question
of
what
the
trial
court
intended
when
he
made
a
partial
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
rule.
these
are
the
problem
of
internal
finality
in
our
terms,
then
the
judge
mean
to
indicate
by
the
form
of
his
order
that
he
was
through
with
the
action
or
was
his
order
intended
to
reserve
some
powers.
a
great
deal
of
litigation
arose
from
ambiguities
in
the
form
of
the
order.
in
some
cases,
the
right
to
appeal
was
lost
because
the
parties
had
not
realized
that
a
partial
judgment
was
intended
to
be
and
was
final
in
the
premises.
a
notable
example
of
this
unfortuned
situation
was
the
dickinson
versus
petroleum
conversion
corporation
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1950.
to
prevent
these
difficulties
and
hardships,
the
advisory
committee
on
the
federal
rules
prepared
and
this
court
promulgated
an
amendment
to
the
rules
effective
in
1948.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
--
well,
i've
ought
to
read
the
amended
rule,
when
more
than
one
claim
for
relief
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
there
is
no
difference
substantially
in
the
position
taken
by
judge
hastie,
judge
learned
hand
and
judge
frank
in
their
various
opinions
in
this
area.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
they
--
they
used
different
language
but
i
think
the
result
is
the
same
in
each
case.
now,
our
position
is
this,
that
a
rule
54
(b)
order
is
not
final,
in
an
appellate
jurisdictional
sense,
it
cannot
be.
the
rules
of
district
--
of
the
district
court
were
never
intended
as
media
or
interpreting
the
congressional
enactment.
they
--
they
establish
finality
in
the
lower
court
sense,
that
is
to
say
they
establish
that
an
order
has
been
entered
which
is
not
subject
to
revision.
by
cross
reference
in
the
rules
under
sections
62
(h)
of
the
rule
--
rule
62
(h)
or
they
may
be
a
stay
of
enforcement
but
the
rule
provides
that
you
can't
revise
it
once
you've
entered
the
final
order,
that
it's
substantial
effect.
the
rule
cannot
decide
the
question
whether
the
subject
matter
on
which
an
order
was
entered
is
sufficiently
separate
and
distinct
so
that
you
have
a
final
order
in
the
statutory
sense.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
mr.
justice
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
--
i
believe
that's
necessarily
so.
i
don't
believe
that
the
rules
of
district
court
procedure
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
it
has
to
exhaust
the
function
of
the
rules
because
otherwise
the
rule
overlaps
section
1291
and
revises
it.
i
don't
think
that
can
be
done
in
the
district
court
rule.
i
--
i've
seen
nothing
in
the
rule
which
--
which
says
that
appellate
courts
can't
examine
the
decision
below
to
find
out
whether
the
traditional
elements
of
statutory
finality
are
present,
the
rule
doesn't
talk
of
appeals,
it
doesn't
talk
of
appellate
courts.
there
was
a
draft
rule
in
this
area,
which
was
extremely
explicit.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
this
situation
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
yes,
sir.
and
the
draft
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
believe
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--
i
believe
there
is
no
question
with
that,
mr.
justice.
the
--
the
predecessor
rule
63
and
you
can
trace
the
history
of
the
rules,
to
see
exactly
where
63
was
replaced
by
54
(b)
provided
an
answer
to
the
very
question
which
is
before
this
court.
the
predecessor
rule
63
(b)
said
that
a
final
judgment
entered
in
accordance
with
rule
63
was
--
was
final
for
all
purposes
including
the
right
to
appeal
there
from.
now,
that's
certainly
one
of
the
questions
which
is
before
this
court,
if
not
the
only
question.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
yes,
mr.
justice.
but
i
would
go
further,
i
would
say
not
only
were
the
draftsman
of
the
original
rules
conscious
to
the
problem
but
having
drafted
a
rule
which
set
forth
the
consequences
of
an
order
for
appeals
purposes.
they
promptly
thereafter
deleted
it
and
they
deleted
it
after
a
correspondence
and
a
history
of
what
you
demonstrated
that
they
deleted
it
because
it
trenched
upon
jurisdictional
statutes.
i've
tried
to
set
some
of
that
up
from
the
brief
from
this
matter.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
mr.
justice,
i
believe
the
notes
of
the
advisory
committee
certainly
have
been
widely
circulated.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
the
notes
are
a
part
of
the
rule
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--
but
beyond
that
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--
i
think
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
--
i
have
not
tried
a
law
library
which
does
not
have
them.
i
went
out
to
the
university
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
there
aren't
law
libraries
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
the
mimeographs
of
correspondents
are
also
in
law
libraries
and
i
think
it's
generally
known
in
the
bar
that
there
is
an
advisory
committee
and
that
the
advisory
committee
can
be
contacted.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
i
--
i
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
--
what
i
meant
to
suggest
was
of
the
--
there
is
an
office
of
an
advisory
committee
and
that
office
can
be
contacted
for
materials
with
respect
to
the
rules.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
can
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
can
assure
this
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
yes,
mr.
justice.
i
may
say
that
i
have
no
particular
access.
i
believed
anything
that
was
confidential
and
i
tried
to
point
out
exactly
where
the
materials
i
was
relying
on
could
be
found
in
this
matter.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that's
exactly
correct.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
and
one
corollary,
the
rule
has
no
affect
with
respect
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
can
examine
on
the
question
of
the
final
decision
under
1291.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
there
was
at
one
time
a
--
a
general
statement
of
an
old
rule
which
said
that
all
issues
as
to
all
parties
had
to
be
disposed
of.
that's
the
hohorst
case
and
--
and
certain
other
cases
that
have
come
up
to
this
court.
now,
as
i
attempted
to
point
out,
that
general
statement
was
never
wholly
accurate.
the
general
statement
merely
reflected
the
general
circumstances
of
practice.
ordinarily,
you
didn't
get
the
different
claims
joined
together.
you
didn't
have
a
liberal
third
party
practice.
you
couldn't
have
a
combination
of
equitable
and
legal
action.
in
those
rare
cases,
where
you
did
have
a
combination
of
different
causes
of
action
or
claims,
the
court
--
the
courts,
including
this
court,
did
decide
that
one
--
that
an
action
of
the
lower
court
with
respect
to
one
of
such
combination
could
be
a
final
order.
therefore,
i
think
the
rules
have
taken
cognizance
of
a
change
in
the
conditions
of
pleading
and
practice
but
they
have
not
changed
the
statutory
construction
under
section
1291.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that
is
my
opinion.
i
attempted
to
touch
on
several
other
cases
which
did
reach
the
similar
result.
the
river
rouge
case,
for
example,
to
some
extent,
reaches
the
similar
result.
the
decisions
of
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
cases
cited
in
collins
versus
m.g.m.
reached
similar
result,
indistinguishable
result.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
no,
mr
justice
black.
i
--
that's
not
my
intention,
whatsoever,
no.
rule
54
(b)
certainly
had
very
important
consequences
at
the
district
court
level.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
the
--
the
court
could
indicate,
the
district
court
judge
could
indicate
that
he
was
through
at
the
part
of
the
action.
he
--
he
could
indicate
what
he
intended
with
respect
to
one
--
one
claim.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
what
is
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
to
that
extent
--
to
the
extent
that
he
could
do
that
before,
i
don't
think
the
rule
didn't
make
any
change.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
in
its
amended
form,
the
rule
by
the
form
which
it
prescribes
directs
the
attention
as
judge
clark
has
said
of
the
trial
court
to
this
very
problem.
in
other
words,
as
to
the
first
element
of
statutory
finality,
whether
the
judges
finished
with
an
action.
the
rule
says,
if
you
enter
the
order,
we
know
you
finished
with
part
of
this
action.
if
you
don't
enter
the
order
in
the
proper
form,
you've
told
us
you
haven't
finished
the
--
your
action.
in
other
words,
the
form
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
the
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--
the
--
the
consequence
of
that,
i
think,
is
largely
to
avoid
the
difficulties
that
arose
in
the
dickinson
situation
which
this
court
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
that
under
the
amended
rule,
there's
any
question.
every
court
that's
ever
handled
the
matter
has
said
that
in
this
sense,
rule
54
(b)
provides
a
very
valuable
aid
to
the
district
courts
and
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
namely,
it
avoids
the
problem
which
arose
in
dickinson.
the
--
the
parties
to
an
action
are
unnoticed
that
the
district
court
judge
is
through
with
the
part
of
the
case.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
one
thing
they
can
do
is
if
think
that
the
part
which
has
been
disposed
of
is
sufficiently
separate
and
distinct
from
the
rest
of
the
subject
matter
if
they
have
any
question
as
to
that.
they
all
noticed
that
they
have
better
filed
a
notice
of
appeal.
otherwise,
they
may
be
foreclosed.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
if
i
--
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice
black.
i
believe
it
gives
them
this
information,
if
the
rule,
if
the
order
is
not
entered
in
the
right
form,
regardless
of
what
--
what
the
judge
has
said
in
his
order
unless
it
comes
to
--
to
a
--
a
determination
that
there's
no
just
reason
for
delay
and
the
direction
for
entry
of
judgment.
the
parties
know
that
they
need
not
take
an
appeal.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you've
stated
our
view
with
respect
to
what
the
rule
does
exactly.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
the
rule
said
it's
just
that.
it
says
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
on
--
on
the
appellant
level,
it
settles
much.
in
the
district
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
it
settles
--
settles
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
believe
that's
right.
i
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that's
a
very
important
difference.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
the
--
this
court,
for
example,
the
--
examining
the
judgment
in
the
dickinson
case,
i
think
split
six-three
as
to
what
--
what
the
trial
judge
had
intended.
therefore,
the
--
that
effect
to
the
rule
is
certainly
very
important.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
the
original
rule,
mr.
justice
reed,
did
not
say
final.
the
addition
of
the
word
"finali",
i
don't
think
makes
any
difference.
i
--
it
--
it
may
have
to
convey
more
of
the
sense
of
finality
at
the
trial
court
rather.the
trial
court
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
but
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe
he
should
be.
the
trial
court
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
he
still
is.
if
--
if
the
order
is
not
entered
in
accordance
with
rule
54
(b)
forms,
he
--
he
still
is.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
if
it's
entered
in
accordance,
he
may
have
some
doubt.
if
it's
not
entered,
he
has
no
doubt
at
all.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
but
that
but
--
but
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
but
in
the
appeal
sense,
it
is
very
important,
it's
one
element
of
finality
that
the
judge
says
that
is
final.
in
other
words,
if
the
judge
said
its
not
final,
you
are
always
lacking
one
element
of
appealability.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
would
certainly
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
would
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
would
certainly
be
prepared
to
make
that
concession.
in
fact,
i've
think
i've
covered
some
of
that
ground
in
the
brief
which
we
filed
in
this
case.
we
don't
need
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
mr.
justice
black,
no,
that
--
that
i
don't
think
is
my
position.
to
some
extent,
it
does
reduce
the
contentiousness
because
it
puts
the
party
unnoticed
as
to
what
the
trial
court
judge
intended
and
tells
him
that
he
is
either
finished
or
not
finished
with
his
action.
if
he
is
not
finished,
clearly
there's
no
appeal.
in
the
converse
situation,
the
affirmative
situation,
when
a
rule
is
entered,
i
think,
the
contentiousness
still
exist.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that
is
true,
but
then
take
the
situation
which
were
presented
in
the
dickinson
case,
was
that
judgment
complete
or
not?
i
think
the
situation
of
the
dickinson
case,
similar
cases
like
that
(inaudible)
it
was
an
old
circuit
court
case
has
--
has
the
problem
presented
there
has
been
eliminated.
but
by
no
means,
as
the
amended
rule
eliminate
all
the
problems
of
finality
on
any
construction,
i
believe,
and
moreover,
there
are
a
lot
of
problems
with
respect
to
statutory
finality
which
the
rule
could
not
possibly
touch.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
think
that's
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
i
believe
it
comes
about
through
the
backdoor.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
that
--
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
--
that
i
believe
is
true.
but
judge
clark,
when
he
construe
with
rule
54
(b)
at
the
appellate
level,
will
examine
for
statutory
finality
in
around
about
way.
he'll
look
into
the
multiplicity
of
claims
and
reincorporate
all
the
statutory
tests.
so,
i
believe
that
judge
clark's
interpretation
while
it
gives
a
very
definitive
affect
to
rule
54
(b)
comes
around
in
a
circle
whereby
the
court
of
appeals
looks
to
the
same
things
that
all
we
did
look
to
under
section
1291.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
well,
judge
clark
in
a
number
of
opinions
after
pabellon
has
announced
that
were
you
have
a
claim
and
a
counterclaim
or
an
affirmative
defense
and
dismiss
one
or
the
other,
the
question
of
whether
you
have
multiple
claims
although
they
appear
to
be
multiple
claims
in
the
sense
of
other
courts
is
a
question
of
whether
the
subject
matter
of
those
claims
and
counterclaims
is
separate
and
distinct.
now,
that
to
me
is
just
a
way
restating
the
test
of
external
finality.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
i
believe
he
had
said
as
much
--
so
many
times
over
in
some
of
his
opinions.
in
other
opinions,
though,
i
believe
he's
receded
somewhat
from
that
position.
mr.
walter
j.
rockler
or
where
you
have
an
affirmative
order,
he'd
left
in
a
considerable
(inaudible)
thank
you.
