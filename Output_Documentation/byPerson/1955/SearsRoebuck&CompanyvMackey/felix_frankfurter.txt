justice
felix
frankfurter
what
type
of
the
question
made
difference
from
that
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
understood
you
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
an
(inaudible)
with
54
(b),
the
district
court
had
to
determine
not
to
write
a
piece
of
paper
saying
it
is
final,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
that
can't
--
that
cant
be
read
onto
this
rule,
whatever
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
--
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
--
under
54
(b),
the
district
court
has
to
say
this
is
--
had
to
enter
a
final
judgment
whatever
the
final
may
mean
under
the
rule
for
getting
all
about
1291,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
then
after
the
court
of
appeals
have
to
find
that
there
was
a
determination
of
finality
within
the
rule,
no
matter
what
the
rule
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
--
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand,
still
don't
understand
that
your
remark,
the
question
here
is
different
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
have
decided?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
it
wouldn't
have
to
reach
for
that
if
it
post
that
final
--
that
under
the
rule,
it
is
final,
it
cannot
mean
something
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
a
different
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
--
unless
this
would
be
final
under
1291.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
doesn't
agree
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
--
suppose
we
hold
if
--
if
we
hold
it
was
final
under
1291
whether
we
don't
to
bother
what
it
understand
in
any
event,
54
(b)
for
taking
care
of
a
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
we
hold
that
54
(b)
isn't
qualified
or
appeal
effectively
1291
and
would
still
have
to
reach
the
question
of
doing
that
and
that
reached
the
question
whether
this
satisfies
the
requirement
of
finality
under
1291.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say,
if
we
--
if
we
reach
that
point,
we
might
hand
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
said
i'd
look
up
to
review
a
question
of
you
--
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
as
to
the
(inaudible)
of
this
litigation.
if
we
--
if
we
disagree,
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
their
construction
of
54
(b)
and
i
say
for
information
then
your
view
is
that
whether
it
satisfies,
whether
it
does
or
does
not
satisfy,
1291
had
better
be
related
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
said
it
was
(inaudible)
valid
in
this
court,
reeves
against
beardall,
shows
no
controversy
about
the
validity
of
this
rule
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question
of
whether
this
particular
complaint
came
within
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
just
verified
my
recollection.
well,
(inaudible)
all
i'm
suggesting
is
the
problem
that
--
that
thereafter
that
after
reading
this,
it
all
--
had
served
this
(inaudible)
without
any
restriction
that
wasn't
--
wasn't
dealt
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
the
question
of
court,
namely,
that
if
we
should
be
construed
to
involve
the
jurisdiction
beyond
1291,
if
it
grant
the
importance,
the
district
court
can
say
something
in
final
that
they
concededly
not
--
can
final
it
under
1291
that
that
would
exceed
the
power
of
the
rule-making
that
heard
about
this
court
by
legislation
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
recognized
by
this
court
suppose
they
(inaudible),
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
if
it
were
all
related
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
deserve
your
argument
with
the
different
states
because
i
know,
as
what
my
mind
could
run
on
(inaudible)
of
yours,
what
your
position
is,
on
this
problem,
or
you
going
to
the
nicest
things
and
--
because
i
have
to
give
a
decision,
what
is
--
what
are
you
contending
for
with
regards
to
the
rule?
are
you
taking
the
flat
decision
or
--
or
you're
taking
in
the
sense
of
the
(inaudible),
what
is
yours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
rule
was
merely
intended
to
govern
the
procedural
activity
that
the
district
does
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
be
--
that,
undoubtedly,
must
be
a
consequence
because
it
does
alert
and
(inaudible),
but
if
that
does
exhaust
the
--
the
function
of
the
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
in
this
area
there
was
a
draft
--
one
of
that
draft
with
reference
to
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
that
draft
of
that,
isn't
it
now
54
(b)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
that's
very
--
so
this
very
rule
had
ascertained
which
by
terms
that
different
a
folk,
was
that
the
finality
came
out
of
the
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
the
rule
of
those
who
were
formulated
it,
those
who
were
engaged
are
positively
training
for
responsible
(inaudible)
rule.
we're
concerned
with
questions
of
appealabilty.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
survived
the
final
conflict
of
training,
(inaudible)
the
proponents
of
(inaudible)
but
the
rule
came
out
of
a
consideration
of
a
problem,
not
merely
binding
the
district
court
but
also
--
also
adding
the
court
of
appeals.
nothing
provides
that.
i'm
saying
that
the
--
the
history
of
the
rule
related
to
that
problem,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
tell
me
--
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't
about
the
(inaudible)
could
you
tell
me
whether
the
history
of
rules
and
all
particularly
this
rules
constitute
material
acceptable
to
be
barred
generally
as
it
seems
in
public
material
which
this
court
may
point
--
will
be
found
in
the
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
notes
are
part
of
the
rule,
the
public
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
about
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
of
the
pleading
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
law
libraries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there
are
couples
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
find
out
naturally
what
they
meant
by
the
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
that
in
the
provision
from
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
of
this
them
may
become
materials
with
a
confidential,
meaning
that
--
between
material
that
are
unpublished
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
across
the
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
party
of
the
--
the
--
or
it
might
be
called
the
legislative
history
of
these
rules
that
are
deposited
to
tell
me
there
he
draw
a
library.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
in
the
law
library
(inaudible)
and
then
your
position
(inaudible)
is
one
known
what
--
what
can
--
you're
directing
with
your
argument
in
analyzing
in
analyzing
with
the
--
it's
your
position
in
54
(b)
as
it
is
now
binding
upon
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
merely,
is
a
ruler
of
the
practice
whereby
the
district
court,
if
he
makes
that
determination,
he
could
no
longer
revise
it
and
if
it
has
dictated,
they
revise
it
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
there
is
an
application
for
that
--
for
such
a
rule
and
that
they
had
to
call
the
rules
against
it,
the
restriction
upon
the
power
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
your
view
that
the
reason
in
(inaudible)
couldn't
decide
as
the
same
way
to
have
acting
on
federal
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand,
i
don't
think
you
may
--
can
finally
say
so
or
declare
that
what
is
just
--
the
one
thing
they
should
have
done
is
to
avoid
controversy
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
--
that
matter
on
which
an
appeal
has
thought
and
have
been
concluded
and
it
leads
within
the
sympathy
of
lawyers
with
different
opinion
among
the
judges
whether
in
effect,
the
district
judge
had
finished.
if
he
hadn't
finished,
then
it
isn't
final
under
1291.
(inaudible)
and
you've
got
conceded
with
the
evidence,
conclusive
evidence,
that
he
is
finished,
can
they
go
on
to
the
second
question,
namely,
wasn't
the
kind
of
things
under
1291
appeal,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
settles
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
a
finality
inform
which
is
the
free
condition
to
any
kinds
of
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
lot
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rockler
you
have
to
conceive
the
doubt
that
the
terms
of
the
concept
of
finality,
the
term
"finality"
coming
down
from
the
1789,
it
is
--
answer
all
questions
as
to
what
is
final.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
a
conscientious
question
had
been
from
1789
but
the
area
of
contention
is
relevantly
limited.
but
there
are
difficulties
that
have
been
--
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
i've
encountered
but
not
to
give
one
problem
from
1789
on
or
whenever
this
place
came
up
as
to
when
judge
(inaudible)
final
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
--
and
that
belong
in
1291
stand.
that's
the
problem,
that's
then
the
problem
for
this
court
to
decide
when
a
state
court
judgement
is
final.
we
have
difficulties
(inaudible)
but
on
the
whole,
we
don't
have
great
barrier.
the
cases
coming
to
this
court,
namely,
that
a
state
court
judgment
would
be
final
and
this
court
has
differed
on
that
in
1789
in
the
number
of
cases
fundamentally
remains
free
through
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
the
other,
if
your
opponent's
argument
come
and
he
anticipated
but
if
the
position
of
such
party
(inaudible)
then
the
rule
does
permit
the
district
court
to
determine
effectiveness
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court,
what
is
the
final
judgment
of
the
district
court
(inaudible)
can
make
to
certify
this
is
in
the
final
judgment
to
determine
54
(b)
in
that
finality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
when
a
great
big
difference
that
54
(b)
is
construed
that
judge
clark
wants
to
construe
then
it
does
take
it
here
of
all
the
contention,
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
(inaudible)
and
the
district
court
to
determine
before
the
courts
of
appeal
and
this
court
when
there's
an
appeal
of
a
judgment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
ground
on
which
it's
been
going
on
to
this
main
of
this
--
this
great
fierce
battle
that's
been
taking
place
(inaudible)
and
it
was
written
on
opinion
which
is,
he
want
to
accomplish
the
implication
of
a
lack
of
questions,
namely,
now,
shut
the
door
to
all
of
these
nonsense,
finding
upstairs
(inaudible)
final
judgment
provided
the
district
court
certify
that
is
final
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
your
argument
said
it
is
final
under
1291?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
be
appealable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
54
(b)
is
not
qualified
as
1291.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
change
what
was
--
what
could
have
been
interpreted
to
be
final
under
1291?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
if
you
agree
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
agree
with
you,
i
mean
to
say
that
you
don't
have
to
follow
what
54
(b)
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you're
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
rule
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
upon
the
appealability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
make
that
appealable
which
before
the
enactment
then
promulgation
of
the
rule
would
have
been
to
prevent
1291.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
understand
it
before
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
includes
before
54
(b)
was
in
the
(inaudible)
that
you
can
set
litigation
then
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
can
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now,
the
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
does
review
the
petition
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
but
it
--
you
told
me
that
language,
i
don't
see
that
quotations
are
amended
directly
or
if
judge
learned
hand
(inaudible)
in
order
to
reject
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
your
understanding
that
the
conflict
within
the
second
circuit
among
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
labors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
the
district
court
construe
with
it
or
--
or
that
is
to
define
(inaudible)
satisfied
1291.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
i
understood
you
this
as
i'm
now
your
(inaudible)
now,
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
that
evidence
be
erroneous
that
is
to
admit
that
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
an
ordering
issue,
no
matter
what
kind
of
an
--
what
the
district
court
does,
you
cannot
have
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
unless
its
satisfy
1291.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
now
understand
you,
mr.
rothschild,
what
the
district
court
can
determine
whether
it
does
satisfied
1291?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
that
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
satisfy
1291,
it's
still
enough
(inaudible)
in
issue
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
of
course
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
trying
to
get
into
the
court
of
--
you
can't
open
that
door
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
piece
of
paper
doesn't
allow
you
to
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
just
entered
an
order
of
mr.
mackey's
short
finding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
--
so
long
as
is
it
goes
your
mind
you
might
(inaudible)
because
although
there's
the
judgment
from
the
district
court
that
this
statement
that
have
been
progressive
and
within
of
its
judgment
and
appeal
about
against
in
which
you
say
you
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
of
appeals
may
still
throw
you
out
and
not
satisfy
1291.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
you
shouldn't
fold
your
arms
and
say,
this
is
part
of
the
immigrated
and
the
organic
litigation
for
the
moment
you
said
i'm
out,
that
i
might
(inaudible)
and
so
on
to
take
party
interest.
i'll
just
fold
my
arms
for
present
as
(inaudible)
fold
my
arms,
my
counsel
would
continue
to
call
the
watching
brief
for
me
until
the
litigation
is
over
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
your
right
with
this
that
remain
unread
and
--
and
nobody
--
the
requirement
of
financing
not
counted
(inaudible)
or
they
should
or
shouldn't
be
there
and
he
live
under
both
(inaudible),
but
never
mind.
that's
immaterial
about
the
question
of
the
party.
but
so
long
as
that
is
the
part
of
the
federal
--
to
state
these
principles
that
that
will
be
the
inconsistency
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
needlessly.
justice

frankfurter
(inaudible)
part
of
it
without
these
briefs
in
particular
cases
it
can
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
doesn't
enable
that
that
couldn't
help,
what
the
scope
of
the
rule
is
but
that
doesn't
tell
us
so
that
the
congress
speak
no
more
than
that
54
(b).
that
was
then
implied
beyond
the
ruling
of
1291
which
says
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
make
it
appealable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
get
to
that,
they
must
decide
whether
they
have
done
and
before
you
decide
that
they
have
done
so,
you
want
to
take
a
long

in
sears
company
would
have
to
invade
if
the
federal
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
know?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
tell
me
that
there
is
--
that
the
test
of
appealability
under
1291,
so
far
as
finality
is
concerned,
has
not
(inaudible)
because
of
54
(b)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
the
question
of
multiple
suits
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
different
problems.
they
are
all
derived
from
the
kind
of
litigations
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
concerned
with
that
point.
i
am
concerned
because
i
think
it
is
deeply
concerned
because
the
--
the
importance
i
have
had
to
the
principle
of
1291
unless
i
find
that
congress
really
has
undercover.
and
i
understood
you
in
the
--
(inaudible)
because
i
think
that
language
for
that,
the
test
for
criteria
to
lead
the
judgment
whatever
you
call
it,
of
what
is
final
under
1291
has
not
drank
the
content
of
appealability
that
the
1291
had
not
drank
(inaudible)
of
54
(b),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible),
you
remember
the
cobbledick
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
not
an
easy
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
that's
the
point
about
finality.
they
are
easy
case
so
that's
--
otherwise,
you
wouldn't
have
the
court
adjudication
in
their
property
or
the
(inaudible)
that
if
the
case
now
that
it
wasn't
(inaudible)
now,
if
you
have
a
situation
by
the
cover
under
54
(b),a
civil
case
because
that
kind
of
a
situation
rose
in
accordance
of
multiple
litigation,
you
will
say
that
that's
the
54
(b).
it
didn't
touch
the
problem
that
you
dealt
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
it
couldn't
be
made
under
54
(b).
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
make
any
difference
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
of
the
other
cases
that's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
whether
in
detachment
for
--
for
both
or
the
reason
to
offer
and
the
question
(inaudible)
the
lifting
of
the
attachment
was
an
appealable
case,
the
court
says
this
is
part
of
our
terms
which
as
the
applicability
--
appealability
to
come
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
early
case,
in
early
case
where
determination
was
made
as
to
who
owns
that
proposition.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
change.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
lets
you
say
what
is
(inaudible)
content
of
finality
is
rather
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
stand
on
that
flat
form
on
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
real
power
would
be
--
would
be
(inaudible)
once
the
--
once
the
credential
was
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
testified
both
--
further
argument.
