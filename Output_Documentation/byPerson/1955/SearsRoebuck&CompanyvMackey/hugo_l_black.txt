justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand.
do
you
mean
that
(inaudible)
has
no
consequence
of
any
kind
to
upheld
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
he
could
do
that
before,
doesn't
it?
he
could
tell
i'm
enthusiast.
i'm
not
going
to
have
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
it
make
any
change
(inaudible)
do
you
say
it
has
no
change
on
the
appellate
level.
now,
what
--
except
to
what
new
situation
that
was
appealed
by
the
rule
that
didn't
exist
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
consequences?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
avoid
it.
don't
you
think
that
to
have
a
law,
you
would
know
whether
he
could
appeal
or
couldn't
appeal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
what
can
the
parties
do
that
they
couldn't
have
done
that
he
had
refrain
from
telling?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
--
they
probably
review
before,
i
guess,
that
--
that
was
a
very
strict
position
and
they
better
file
notice
of
appeal
(inaudible)
but
does
it
give
me
a
new
information
on
when
it
can
and
whether
it
should?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
settle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say
what
did
it
settle?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
a
statement
from
the
judge
that
they
aren't
finished
before
you
get
against
whether
he'd
finish
or
not,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
one
of
the
fine
targets
in
the
dickinson
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
doesn't
amended
our
thought
which
are
the
pretty
bad
situation
there
because
you
couldn't
know
whether
you
could
feel
or
not.
it
still
left
in
the
same
situation
in
54
(b)
according
to
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
whether
he
should
be
he
still
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
he
--
if
it
--
if
it
done
in
an
accordance
to
it.
he
showed
that
there's
much
doubt
as
to
whether
it's
appealable,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say,
he
has
no
doubt
that
the
judge
said
that
it
is
not
found.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
that's
the
final
at
the
(inaudible)
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
i
want
to
be
sure,
do
you
argue
here
that
this
contended
that
we
could
(inaudible)
from
1789
on
this
field
that
this
rule
54
(b)
does
not
and
was
not
designed
of
the
reviews
of
the
contention
vested
all
insofar
as
appealability
is
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
judgment
remedy
has
demanded
he's
ordered
to
pay
$5000,
he
has
a
pretty
good
idea
of
that
finished
--
(inaudible)
whether
the
judge
said
i'll
pay
tonight,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
mean
to
leave
an
implication
about
(inaudible).
i
just
was
trying
to
find
out
whether
the
lawyers
who
have
the
judgment
there,
as
in
more
reasonable
grounds
to
think
maybe
it's
possible
that
you
don't
know
whether
he
could
feel
about
that
it's
the
(inaudible)
rule
54
(b)
was
an
enacted
or
is
he
still
there
going
to
--
what
might
be
said,
he
had
slight
may
(inaudible)
uncertainty
of
whether
his
judgment
feels
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
ought
to
be
has
not
able
to
pursue
the
rule
that
would
be
the
statute,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
the
brief
can
decide
which
case
by
construing
the
act
of
congress
passed
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
i
understand
you
are
(inaudible)
and
we
won't
have
to
read
this
more
difficult
question
about
--
prepared
by
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
do
that
of
what
you
heard
that
that
is
the
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
outside
of
the
court,
if
they
throw
us
the
appeal
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
is
just
time.
it's
just
the
part
of
the
inherent
on
(inaudible)
of
what
find?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
getting
any
ideas
that
is
there
anything
more
involved
in
this
section,
the
final
analogy.
i'm
--
i'm
really
asking
you
to
consider
because
i
don't
know.
if
they
know
they
would
try
to
appeal
(inaudible)
believes
the
one
to
be
barred
or
have
any
right
to
take
it
away
from
you,
it's
finally
taken
away.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
win
or
you
lose,
either
one
of
you
have
any
right
to
finally
taken
away
from
here
that
can't
ultimately
be
settled
under
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
why
i
agree
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
multiple
appeals
that
uncertainty
as
to
whether
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
almost
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
the
word
“finality”
is
so
indefinite
that
will
--
we
can't
have
what
the
judges
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you?
do
you
--
you
said
several
times
as
i
observed
1291,
it
is
your
position
that
this
is
appealable
under
1291?
justice
hugo
l.
black
appealable
under
1291
and
its
clear
that
it
is.
what
rule
do
you
have
to
do
with
this
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
want
you
to
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
did?
if
--
if
you're
--
and
i
term
that
you're
saying
as
to
take
the
parts
of
the
same
--
the
judgment
to
this
appeal
has
no
relation
(inaudible)
to
--
that
were
still
left
undecided
to
these
separate
parts
of
the
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
just
separate
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
not
--
have
not
to
do
with
one
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
forgetting
54
(b).let's
suppose
it
has
never
been
said.
what
would
happen
in
reference
(inaudible)
would
you
had
to
file
under
separate
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
--
couldn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
have
in
mind
--
i
don't
know
that
it's
--
it
may
not
be
covered
to
ask
it
that
exists.
if
then,
if
have
you
have
appealed
to
this
judgment,
if
you
have
appealed,
if
a
final
disposition
of
causes
of
action
have
nothing
to
do
that
are
not
related
(inaudible)
to
be
filed
wholly
separate
in
part,
there's
nobody
to
define,
there's
nobody
that
can
impose
of
that
they
are
final
under
1291.
what
relevance,
except
for
the
fact
that's
been
mentioned
before
if
54
(b)
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
stamp
is
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
that
rule
was
intended
to
give
and
give
enough
there
without
the
stamp,
that
rule
has
no
relevance
because
the
stamp
is
on
it,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
what
other
relevancies
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not

justice

(inaudible)
justice

(voice

much
uncertain
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
intend
to
get
there
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
they're
just
the
same
under
1291,
appeals
