mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
may
it
please
the
court.
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
the
petitioner
herein
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
a
motion
which
appears
at
page
39
of
this
record
which
in
pertinent
part
eliminating
the
two
paragraphs
which
are
purely
dilatory.
in
pertinent
part,
asked
that
--
that
court
to
dismiss
the
appeal
taken
herein
for
lack
of
a
final
and
appealable
order
meeting
the
requirements
of
section
1291.
we
have
sat
here
as
the
court
has
and
heard
nothing
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
this
order
is
final
and
appealable
under
section
1291.
the
petitioner
apparently
defaults
on
this
issue
on
the
ground
battle.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
may
have
used
language
in
its
opinion
which
indicates
that
that
question
was
not
an
issue.
i
should
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
this,
directs
its
attention
of
this
very
simple
motion
that
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
very
simple
order
which
was
made
and
appears
on
page
47
of
the
record.
it
is
ordered
and
adjudged
by
the
court
that
the
motion
to
dismiss
this
appeal
be
and
the
same
is
hereby
denied.
the
emotion
again
was
to
dismiss
the
appeal
for
lack
of
a
final
and
appealable
order
meeting
the
requirement
of
section
1291.
there
is
no
suggestion
by
petitioner
that
this
order
was
not
final,
none
whatsoever.petitioner
doesn't
discuss
the
question
of
finality
preferring
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
that
question
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
i
would
like
to
place
the
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
it
must
be
final
under
1291.
section
1291
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
to
be
appealable.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor,
1291
determines
the
appellate
jurisdiction.
now,
54
(b)
does
some
thing
but
it
does
not
determine
appellate
jurisdiction.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
no,
sir.
it
does
not
in
my
opinion.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
the
--
what
--
what
54
(b)
does,
if
i
may
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
your
honor?
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
may
say
that
the
--
the
first
point
that
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
reason
why
you
should
not
send
this
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
here
is
the
question
that
is
the
question
of
this
court
rule
and
no
local
law
questions
involved,
there
are
no
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
your
honor?
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
no.
the
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
no,
sir.
i
didn't
--
if
i
said
that,
i
didn't
mean
to.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
jurisdiction
is
determined
by
section
1291
which
is
the
jurisdictional
statute.
the
--
the
operation
of
rule
54
(b)
operates
within
that
jurisdictional
statute.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
it
may.
yes,
your
honor.
but
there
is
no
change
in
1291
and
that
--
there
--
my
thesis
on
that
is
fairly
simple,
you
may
not
agree
with
it
but
it's
fairly
simple.
i
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
say
this
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
say
this,
your
honor,
that
you
take
an
order
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court
and
i'll
get
the
automatic
and
conclusive
which
is
just
frightening
itself,
(inaudible)
for
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court,
if
it
comes
to
(inaudible)
determines
three
things
on
and
amended
54
(b)
finding
and
it
must
determine
those
three
things
in
order
to
determine
whether
section
1291
appealabilty
exist.
it
determines
first
whether
multiple
claims
are
involved.
if
there
are
not,
then
rule
54
(b)
has
no
application.
it
determine
second
whether
the
disposition
of
the
claims
upon
which
an
appeal
was
taken
is
final
in
the
sense
that
have
those
claims
been
the
sole
claims
then
issue
or
have
that
claim
in
the
sole
claim
and
issue,
would
the
disposition
made
by
the
trial
court
have
been
appealable
and
that
determination
is
the
determination
that
satisfies
1291.
and
if
that
determination
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
must
satisfy
1291.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
it
must
satisfy
1291
and
i
will
never
argue
that
it
--
that
--that
can
bootstrap
yourself
around
1291.
and
i
say
that
in
--
on
this
thesis,
this
notion
of
final
finality
which
has
come
down
from
the
original
act
has
not
changed.
the
basic
concept
is
the
same.
now,
there
have
been
changes
in
what
cases
are
appealable.
cases
are
appealable
now
or
under
the
original
rule
which
would
not
have
been
but
they
are
still
appealable
under
1291
because
there's
the
satisfaction
of
this
finality
requirement
with
respect
to
the
particular
claims
and
issue
and
that's
all
what
reeves
says.
reeves
doesn't
says
that
54
(b)
changed
1291.
it
just
said
that
it
was
the
pleading
that
were
permitted.
under
the
rule,
you
can
take
all
a
lesser
segment,
a
lesser
quantum
and
use
judge
hastie's
language
of
the
litigation.
and
if
that
is
disposed
of
in
a
manner
that
is
final
in
the
sense
that
it
was
appealable
with
the
--
with
the
sole
claim
and
issue,
then
1291
is
satisfied.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
i
--
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
not
here
to
argue
that
a
tremendous
and
radical
change
has
been
made
by
--
either
by
the
original
rule
or
by
the
amended
rule,
1291
is
still
there
and
still
must
be
honored.
now,
there
are
--
are
things
done
within
1291
which
were
done
by
the
original
rule,
which
were
done
before
the
original
rule
and
which
are
done
now
under
the
amended
rule.
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
we
have
not
heard
one
word
from
petitioner
as
to
the
basic
question
and
issue,
did
the
court
of
appeals
directly
denied
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
to
put
another
way,
was
the
--
the
district
court
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
they
didn't
deal
with
the
case
in
a
way
in
which
i
urged
them
to
deal
with
the
case.
they
did
in
part,
your
honor,
in
its
quotation
from
bendix
which
i
will
come
to.
the
court
of
appeals
recognizes
that
there
must
be
this
determination
of
multiplicity
of
claims
and
finality
with
respect
to
the
claims
and
issue.
it
did
not
deal
with
the
free
48
or
free
amendment
situation.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that
may
be,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
don't
think
there
is
that
create
dilemma,
your
honor.
i
think
if
i
get
the
gist
of
your
question
that
--
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
this
rule
operates
within
1291
and
should
be
so
interpreted.
i'm
not
sure
i
answered
your
question.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
i'm
an
advocate
and
i'm
perfectly
delighted
to
have
the
court
decide
it
my
way
in
any
or
with
passionate
wishes
but
i
think
the
proper
analysis
is
to
--
to
fit
this
rule
into
the
--
into
the
section
1291
even
not
to
rely
on
the
enabling
act
which
is
some
of
the
so-called
affirmative
view
judges
rely
on.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
all
right.
may
i
state
it
this
way,
your
honor?
i
think
that
conflict
is
very
largely
a
conflict
of
labors.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
of
labors.
the
conflict
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
they
certainly
got
hot
about
it
and
i
suppose
they
are
still
hot
about
it
although
the
source
of
the
conflict
has
been
eliminated
by
the
overruling
of
flegenheimer.
in
a
recent
case
rieser
versus
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
they
say
we
expressly
reject
that
flegenheimer
is
no
longer
the
law
in
this
circuit.
they
say
--
they
think
they're
overruling,
as
they
in
word
and
judge
frank
who
is
--
is
not
pleased,
acknowledges
that
they
have
overruled
it
on
the
basis
of
two
earlier
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
goes
along
with
the
overruling.
but
my
point
on
affirmative
and
negative
which
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
asking
me
to
speak
on
is
this,
i
really
don't
think
there
s
a
great
deal
of
difference
as
applied
to
particular
cases.
now,
i
will
acknowledge
that
the
negative
effect,
that
is
to
say
absence
of
the
54
(b)
finding,
you
cannot
appeal,
is
(inaudible)
so
to
speak,
that
does
determine
one
complete
set
of
situation.
if
there
is
no
appeal
and
no
then
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
have
gone
along
on
that.
but
i
do
not
go
to
judge
clark
an
automatic
and
conclusive
in
the
sense
that
you
could
take
your
54
(b)
stamp
and
put
it
on
anything
and
have
a
--
an
appealable
order
under
1291
because
that
would
fly
in
the
face
of
--
of
section
1291.
and
my
position
is,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
answering
your
question
but
i
make
it
toward
around
the
belt,
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
should,
they
can
and
they
do
review
this
54
(b)
findings
for
these
three
things,
multiple
claims,
finality
as
to
the
claims
upon
which
the
appeal
has
based,
tested
as
sole
claims
and
issue
and
possibly
even
abuse
the
discretion
in
making
the
finding
of
no
just
reason
for
delay
which
can
be
reviewed
just
us
any
other
finding
of
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
finality,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
word
"final,"
the
words
"final
judgment"
when
used
in
this
area
in
this
context
by
words
of
conclusion,
meaning
appealability
and
if
they
don't
advance
it
very
far
to
--
to
have
new
answers
on
the
reason
and
the
meanings
--
meaning
of
the
word
itself.
there
are
words
of
conclusion
meaning
appealabilty.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
and
were
so
on
--
and
--
and
i
feel
that
the
introduction
as
mr.
justice
reed
has
suggested
in
his
question
of
the
phrase
final
judgment
into
the
amended
rule
for
the
first
time
was
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
inserting
this
intention
to
connote
appealability.
final
judgment
in
this
area
means,
"you
can
go
upstairs
now,
i'm
through."
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
there's
no
question
about
in
my
view
and
that's
what
i
depart
from
mr.
clark,
mr.
--
with
--
in
judge
clark.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
it
determines
for
itself
and
for
us
as
the
preliminary
matter.
absence
of
such
a
finding,
we're
not
here.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
difficulty
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that's
correct.
and
if
i
may
say
so
in
response
to
the
line
of
question
that
mr.
justice
black
is
putting
the
counsel
for
petition.
you
are
not
in
the
same
place
you
were
prior
to
be
amended
rule.
you
are
(inaudible)
because
if
you
follow
the
--
the
view
that
it
has
only
negative
effect
because
here
we
come,
mr.
dickinson
comes
back
to
this,
to
the
trial
court,
he
will
say
of
the
--
to
the
corporation
that
is
involved
on
the
dealer.
along
he
comes
then
this
order
has
entered.
now,
he
can't
afford
not
to
appeal
just
as
mr.
mackey
in
this
case
could
not
have
afford,
not
to
afford
if
not
to
appeal.
if
we
had
not
appeal
in
this
case
in
the
face
of
that
finding,
we
would
have
taken
a
very
substantial
risk
that
at
the
disposition
and
after
the
disposition
of
the
entire
case,
and
we
would
then
appeal
we
would
be
met
just
as
they
were
in
dickinson
by
the
argument
you
ought
to
have
appeal
--
look
we
made
this
finding
we
told
you
to
appeal.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
the
judge
entered
the
order
submitted
to
him
by
sears,
roebuck
&
company
the
petitioner
here
who
acknowledged
in
their
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment
they
thought
it
was
final
and
appealable.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
no.
it's
the
fellow
against
to
whom
the
judgment
has
entered,
your
honor,
i
misspoke
if
i
said
in
this
case.
because
you
see,
prior
to
this
stamp
of
approval
thought
as
the
--
you
at
least
have
an
opportunity
to
guess
,well,
should
i
appeal
or
can
i
take
a
chance
that
this
is
not
final.
but
i
don't
believe
any
practicing
lawyer
would
not
appeal
losing
as
we
do
in
the
district
court
in
the
face
of
such
a
finding
and
so
i
say
that
it
tends
to
argue
that
some
affirmative
effect
should
be
given
to
the
rule.
but
i
still
say
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
the
court
of
appeals
still
may
throw
us
out
and
i
say
it's
under
a
duty
to
examine
that
question.
now,
i
would
like
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
what
have
i
heard?
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
suppose
i'm
thrown
out
here,
your
honor,
i'm
hurt
about
2
and
half
years.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
certainly,
if
the
place
on
that
basis
but
to
the
litigant
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
if
don't
appeal
i
may
be
in
trouble
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
that's
my
point.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i'm
forced
to
--
to
multiple
appeals
as
involved
what
it
amounts
to.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
whether
it
be
heard
on
the
merits.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
your
honor,
i
say
to
you
as
a
witness
on
the
practical
side
that
there
is
no
practicing
lawyer
who
would
afford
--
who
could
afford
to
fold
his
arms
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
this
rule,
some
effect
is
not
given
to
it
multiplies
the
hazards
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
needlessly.
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
i
would
like
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
even
after
they
have
said
so
in
accordance
with
the
rule
that
fell
out
the
way
to
say
so.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
the
address
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
prior
to
the
original
rule,
your
honor,
or
to
the
amendment?
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
that's
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer,
your
honor,
because
i
have
some
doubt
as
to
whether
this
pleading
could
have
been
filed
prior
to
the
original
rule.
it
is
so
(inaudible)
so,
many
counts
involved
that
i
have
some
doubt
really
that
this
particular
pleading
could
have
been
--
could
have
raised
this
issue
prior
to
the
original
rules
because
of
the
multiplicity.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that
is
not
so,
your
honor,
and
i
want
to
adjust
myself
with
that.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
as
i
say
it's
very
difficult
to
answer
that
question
because
it
is
even
more
abstract
from
the
question
of
petitioner
wishes
you
to
decide
because
i
doubt
very
much
at
this
very
pleading
could
have
come
up
this
way
under
the
free
rule
practice
before
the
original
rule
themselves.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
the
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
the
general
doctrine
was
that
it
has
to
dispose
of
all
matters
in
controversy
before
our
party.
but
i
think
i
would
cover
that
in
the
course
of
discussion
of
the
pre-amendment
situation.
i
am
suggesting
and
i'm
urging
to
this
court
that
this
order
was
appealable
prior
to
the
amended
rule
54
(b)
and
that
it
is
almost
the
waste
of
this
court's
time
or
an
imposition
in
this
case
to
discuss
the
appealabilty
under
amended
rule
54
(b)
because
all
judges,
all
parties
concede
that
where
the
order
would
have
been
appealable
prior
to
the
amendment
to
the
rule,
the
record
defining
having
been
made
under
the
amended
rule,
the
order
is
appealable.
and
to
discuss
that,
which
we
feel
is
conclusive
of
this
case,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
complaint
itself.
some
comment
has
been
made
by
petitioner
really
directed
to
the
arrangement
of
the
complaint.
the
claims
involved
here
are
separate
and
distinct
under
preamendment
or
original
rule
54
(b)
standards.
three
historical
events
took
place,
so
to
speak,
physical
facts,
this
is
not
one
fact
with
several
cause
of
action
alleged
out
of
it.
mr.
mackey
was
in
the
lamp
business
in
1949
and
sears
drove
him
out
of
it,
so
it
is
alleged.
subsequently,
in
1951
and1952,
mr.
mackey
was
--
had
a
an
advantageous
contract
for
commissions,
and
sears,
by
means
of
a
threatened
boycott
of
the
other
contracting
party
who
also
(inaudible)
with
sears,
forced
or
induced
the
breach
of
that
contract,
a
second
physical
historical
event.
at
--
at
or
about
the
same
time,
mr.
mackey
threw
a
time
saver,
a
corporation
wholly
owned
by
him,
was
driven
out
of
the
two
businesses
or
sought
to
be
by
means
of
unfair
competition
in
top
of
an
infringement.
and
as
i
suggested
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
it's
somewhat
--
is
this
mr.
mackey
had
been
selling
on
one
street
corner
in
1949
and
been
hit
by
a
sears
truck.
and
in
1950,
standing
on
another
street
corner
was
hit
by
another
sears
truck,
and
in
1951,
standing
on
a
third
street
corner
was
hit
by
a
third
sears
truck
and
at
that
point
scratches
his
head
and
besides
there
may
be
something
more
to
this
than
just
an
accident.
and
that's
what's
involved
here,
you
have
three
very
separate
incidents
of
business
oppression,
predatory
conduct
which
are
setup
as
common
law
causes
of
action
with
diversity,
and
a
fourth
cause,
an
antitrust
cause
that
this
was
all
entered
as
an
over
all
scheme
of
predatory
conduct
with
the
specific
intent
to
drive
him
out
business,
to
discipline
sears
suppliers
and
to
monopolize
trade
of
commerce
in
the
area
operated
in
by
mr.
mackey.
this
is
not
just
a
question
of
arrangement
of
--
of
count.these
are
separate
physical
events
as
i
conceive
them.
now,
under
the
standards
of
reeves
versus
beardall
and
collins
versus
metro-goldwyn
pictures,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
order
entered
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
would
have
been
appealable.
it
satisfies
the
1291
requirements
and
there's
no
reason
for
this
court
to
concern
itself
with
the
question
that
may
be
raised
by
the
case
that
needed
to
be
argued
after
as
to
what
the
effect
of
the
amended
rule
is
in
a
case
which
may
not
have
been
presented
in
appealable
order
under
the
rules
prior
to
the
amendment
in
1948.
that
is
to
say,
here
we
have
an
order,
i
don't
care
what
system
you
use,
take
petitioner's
view,
take
judge
clark's
view,
take
judge
hastie's
view,
take
the
view
of
gold
seal
and
then
the
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
that
this
order
would
be
appealable
and
what
is
all
is
shouting
about.
now,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
defend,
what
i
would
call
a
modified
affirmative
view
that
is
to
say
that
the
courts
of
--
that
the
rule
has
some
affirmative
effect
and
perfectly
willing
to
defend
the
rule
and
the
original
rule
as
being
consistent
and
not
in
violation
of
section
1291.
but
i
say
to
the
court
that
--
that
is
all
unnecessary
to
the
decision
of
this
case.
here
is
an
order
clearly
appealable
under
the
original
rule.
the
magic
phrases
have
been
entered.
there's
no
suggestion
of
the
court
that
views
this
discretion
in
finding
no
just
reason
for
delay.
there's
no
suggestion
that
multiple
claims
aren't
involve.
here
is
the
very
kind
of
case
for
which
both
the
original
rule
and
the
amended
rule
were
intended
to
apply.
and
i
say
that
this
court
can
dispose
of
this
case
without
reaching
the
amended
rule
question
just
as
i
say
and
i
will
not
urge
here
out
of
respect
for
the
court
wish
to
determine
the
rule
54
(b)
question
that
i
believe
that
this
order
may
be
appealable
under
section
1292.
but
i
would
like
to
put
in
my
defense
of
the
affirmative
view
modified,
as
i
say
it
must
be,
to
require
the
courts
of
appeals
to
do
just
what
they
have
been
doing.
and
the
--
and
the
cases
in
which
they
have
been
doing
it
are
set
out
that
the
pages
and
the
footnote
at
pages
38
and
39
of
respondent's
brief.
the
courts
have
been
reviewing
this.
there's
no
automatic
and
conclusive,
you
couldn't
take
an
order
like
the
order
in
cobbledick
versus
united
states
put
a
54
(b)
finding
on
it
and
come
in
to
court
and
ask
to
be
heard
by
court
of
appeals.
that
is
not
a
final
order
under
1291.
now,
i
should
like
to
say
that
on
the
affirmative
view,
so
called,
there
really
is
no
technical
conflict
in
the
circuit.
the
flegenheimer
decision
according
to
the
--
to
the
second
circuit
itself
is
no
longer
the
law
in
that
circuit.
there
is
no
other
decision,
i
say
decision
technically,
which
upholds
the
negative
view.
judge
hastie
in
the
bendix
case,
on
the
contrary,
imposes
the
same
kinds
of
test
that
i'm
urging
this
court
to
state
for
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
as
to
what
the
amended
rule
does.
in
other
words,
judge
hastie,
a
petitioner
has
pointed
out,
says
you
have
to
have
multiple
claims.you
have
to
have
a
certain
quantum
of
litigations,
scope
of
the
claims
as
he
put
it.
he
finds
in
the
compulsory
counter
claims
case,
these
multiple
claims
are
not
involved.
i
don't
need
to
reach
that
question
and
i
understand
that
that
question
or
part
of
that
question
before
the
court
in
the
case
that
follow,
that
finding
not
only
a
single
claim
was
involved,
he
says
that
the
court
has
no
power
under
1291
to
confer
appellant
jurisdiction,
if
you
will,
and
that
is
the
same
kind
of
analysis
that
i'm
urging
on
the
court.
in
the
gold
seal
case
which
is
the
only
other
court
as
(inaudible)
so-called
negative
view.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
should
think
it
could,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
that
is
an
argument
that
is
made
and
i'm
--
i
stated
to
the
court
that
i'm
suggesting
that
that
argument
is
a
valid
argument
but
i
do
not
rely
solely
on
it
because
i
--
into
your
speaking
of
the
enabling
act
which
gives
the
--
the
rule
of
the
force
of
statute
and
if
the
statutory
problem,
the
enabling
act
prevails.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
no.
but
as
i
understand
the
question
from
mr
justice
minton,
if
congress
said
to
us
specifically,
“now,
we
want
to
change
1291
to
this
extent
to
give
the
court,
the
district
court
the
right
to
put
a
stamp
on
anything
and
make
it
appealable.”
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
they
could
do
it.
however,
unwise
it
may
be.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
go
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
and
it's
my
position
that
it
must
be
appealable
under
1291
or
i
can't
come
in.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
the
rule
has
to
do
it,
if
i
may
say
so,
solely
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
solely
because
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
whom
unfortunate
language
was
used
upon
which
petitioner
(inaudible)
to
urge
this
court
to
say
to
the
court
of
appeals,
“you
used
some
bad
language.
your
decision
may
be
right
but
you
used
some
bad
language.
now,
go
back
and
use
the
right
language.”
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
there
could
be
separate
cases.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
they
could
be
separate
cases.
i
can't
say,
your
honor,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other.
they
could
be
separate
cases
there,
separate
in
the
terminology
of
original
rule
54
(b),
yes.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
i
get
confused.
that's
--
antedates
my
practice.
but
in
my
understanding
that
this
type
of
a
complaint
would
have
been
troubled
them
under
the
free
rules
practice
because
of
the
multiplicity.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
and
that
you
may
not
have
--
have
been
able
to
raise
this
question
that
you're
suggesting
under
the
pre-rule's
practice
so
that
--
i
don't
how
i
can
answer
that.
i
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
the
relevance
that
it
has
again
is
the
opening
of
the
door.
that
is
to
say
under
the
amended
rule,
the
door
doesn't
even
open
unless
the
stamp
is
put
on.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
the
stamp
is
on
it
and
i
--
and
i
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
and
i
say
to
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
that
gets
to
the
question
which
is
the
difficult
question,
even
assuming
you
are
--
the
court
is
with
the
respondent
on
the
--
on
the
case
and
that
is
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
really
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
i
was
going
to
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
i
was
going
to
adopt
the
question
because
i
don't
want
to
be
presumptuous
but
i'll
discuss
it
because,
i
think,
it's
the
question
of
the
court
that
must
determine.
that
question,
as
i
see
it,
falls
down
to
what
orders
are
appealable
now
that
would
have
been
prior
to
the
amendment
to
the
rule.
in
other
words,
have
you
advanced
anyone
you
get
for
the
stamp
or
are
the
test
the
same
as
prior
to
be
amended
rule.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes.
and
then,
i
say
that
leaves
logically
to
the
question,
what,
even
under
the
affirmative
view,
what
happened?
what
is
there
new
about
the
stamp
of
approval,
granted
that
--
with
all
that
you
can't
get
in,
can
you
get
in
if
you
have
it
if
you
couldn't
have
gotten
in
before.
now,
i
say
you
need
to
reach
that
question
on
this
case
because
you
could
have
gotten
in
before.
you
could
clearly
come
in
here
prior
to
the
amended
rule.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
well,
let
me
--
let
me
try
to
reassure
you
again.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
say
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
say
this,
your
honor,
that
if
you
will
take
out
of
a
multiple
claims
case,
one
claim
that
has
been
disposed
of
--
in
“dispose
of
in
the
district
court
with
the
others
left
undisposed
of
in
the
district
court.”
you
then
examine
the
disposition
of
the
particular
claim
on
conventional
1291
standard,
it
must
be
--
now,
getting
the
words
of
art,
a
final
judgment
in
the
sense
that
if
it
where
the
sole
claim
in
suit,
it
would
now
be
appealable.
and
i
say
that,
that
affect
1291
and
i
think
that's
the
basis
upon
which
i
reassure
you
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
it's
an
easy
case
now.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
and
clearly
not
appealable.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
clearly
not
appealable,
not
without
--
if
the
54
(b)
stamp
is
put
on
the
cobbledick
order
and
it
comes
to
this
court
again,
it
is
clearly
not
appealable.
is
that
responsive
here?
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
because
that
order
is
not
final
within
the
1291
standard,
it's
entirely
preliminary
to
figure.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
say
if
a
--
if
a
54
(b)
stamps
was
put
on
it.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
--
would
make
any
difference
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i'm
not
certainly
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that
is
our
view.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
no
change.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
not
only
agree
with
it,
i
think
i
have
to
agree
with
it.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
that's
correct,
my
real
quarrel
with
the
petitioner
is
that
we
have
so
clearly
a
final
order
that
we
shouldn't
be
mocking
around
in
this
court
on
amended
rule
54
(b).
now,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
discuss
any
aspect
with
the
affirmative
view
but
i
don't
think
we
needed
it.
mr.
edward
i.
rothschild
i
also
want
to
state
that
in
our
view,
i
may
have
said
or
alluded
to
this
obliquely,
i
would
like
to
state
that
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeal,
perhaps,
somewhat
unknowingly
applied
this
same
test
that
i'm
urging
to
this
court.
that
is
to
say,
including
the
bendix
opinion
at
page
45
of
the
record,
the
court
recognizes
that
this
necessity
for
multiple
claims
to
be
found
for
final
judgment
on
the
particular
claim
and
for
the
correct
exercise
of
discretion.
now,
i
say
and
urge
this
court
to
state
clearly
for
the
benefit
of
--
of
those
of
us
who
come
again
on
these
problems
that
that
is
the
correct
test
that
ought
to
be
applied
in
these
54
(b)
cases.
and
i
also
urged
the
court
not
to
take
the
invitation
proper
to
it
by
petitioner
to
send
this
case
back
to
determine
whether
the
court
of
--
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
take
another
look
at
it
on
the
test
which
this
court
enunciates
before
the
court
of
appeals.
there's
nothing
going
to
change
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
have
the
complaint,
the
district
court
order,
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
and
it
presents
solely
a
procedural
question
and
this
court's
rule,
there
are
no
local
law
questions
or
fact
questions
which
the
court
of
appeals
can
help
you
on
and
i
might
say
from
the
fact
that
there
are
or
have
been
very
few
54
(b)
cases
since
these
cases
were
docketed.
the
courts
of
appeals
are
awaiting
your
decision
to
help
them
in
this
54
(b)
area
and
you
--
it
seems
to
ask
that
you
ought
to.
i
do
not
do
more
than
allude
to
the
fact
that
we
have
been
seriously
prejudiced
by
the
long
delay
that
has
come
already
and
that
would
seem
to
us
that
there'd
be
no
reason
to
postpone
that
ultimate
determination
of
this
any
further
so
that
we
could
get
the
trial
as
promptly
as
possible
on
this
case
that
should
have
been
on
now
for
almost
three
years
which
may
seem
a
short
time
in
relation
to
the
case
that
follows.
but
so
far
as
we
are
concerned,
it's
a
very
long
time
and
we're
still
a
long
way
from
home.
in
our
view,
the
affirmative
--
the
--
the
order
of
the
district
court
was
clearly
appealable
under
preamendment
rule.
it's
clearly
appealable
under
preamendment
rule.
it's
clearly
appealable
under
the
amended
rule
without
regard
to
what
view
you
take
of
the
amended
rule.
you
can
take
the
negative
view,
the
affirmative
view,
judge
clark's
view,
professor
morris
view,
judge
hastie's
view,
the
gold
seal's
view
or
my
view
or
any
other
view
you
can
think
of
and
i'm
still
appealable.
thank
you.
