which
one
of
those
three
groups,
did
you
say
you
represented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
represent
all?
justice
hugo

including

including
the
wage
earners,
too?
justice

l.
black
you
represent

justice
hugo

black
if
it
wouldn't
disturb
you,
i
--
i
understand
the
claim
of
the
wage
earners,
the
term
here
as
to
why
the
creditors
would
be
injured
by
the
taking
away
their
lead.
what
is
the
basis
for
your
statement
that
their
other
creditors
would
be
injured?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
indicate
any
desire
at
all,
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
i
was
asking
is
related
to
the
statement
of
that
this
counsel,
would
you
say
they
have
indicated
no
desire
to
have
inputted
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
they
indicated
any
of
provisions
and
is
being
inputted
again?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
record
show
how
it
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
have
taken
no
part
of
any
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
see
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
i'm
not
sure
of
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
in
this
proceeding
where
a
question
was
raised
as
to
which
one
it
should
come
on
the
x
or
xi,
the
evidence
shows
beyond
dispute,
that
it
finally
shows
beyond
dispute,
that
under
xi
proceedings
all
creditors
would
be
paid
in
full,
secured
and
unsecured.
whether
if
it
was
drawn
into
xi
proceeding
whatever
the
charge
of
the
--
of
going
--
going
into
x
proceeding,
the
extension
or
something
else
in
connection
with
the
x
proceeding
would
(inaudible)
so
that
the
creditors
would
not
be
paid
in
full.
if
such
a
finding
were
made
that's
supported
by
evidence,
the
one
that
was
challenged.
what
would
be,
if
you
were
arguing
that
under
the
former
case
it
would
have
to
go
through
a
x?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
about
this
case.
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
regard
to
the
size.
take
any
size
you
please,
any
number
of
stockholders,
if
you
please.
you
have
a
challenge
and
evidence
was
heard.
the
court
finds
that
under
the
xi
proceeding,
the
creditors
will
be
paid
100
cents
on
the
dollar.
it's
beyond
any
shadow
of
a
doubt,
that
finding
is
supported
by
evidence.
and
that
if
you
move
into
a
x
proceeding,
the
expenses
or
either
a
part
of
it,
sold
there,
the
creditors
will
not
be
paid
in
full.
cannot,
possibly,
be
paid
in
full.
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
your
argument
that
it
was
the
--
the
law
requires,
that
it's,
nevertheless,
going
to
a
x
proceeding,
under
our
united
states
realty
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
it
found
here?
the
fact,
of
course,
and
whatever
facts
were
found?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
answered
by
saying
that
no
such
finding
could
be
possibly
be
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
that
it
could
just
for
a
moment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
always
to
hold
that
all
the
bankruptcy
if
i
had
anything
to
do
with
(inaudible)
as
the
basic
primary
decision
was
permanent
to
see
that
the
creditors
were
paid
before
the
stockholders
got
in,
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
any
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
individual
i
suppose.
if
he
owes
money
that
he's
not
holding
things
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
same
principle
is
applied
to
xi
to
the
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
don't
think
you
have
any
burden
here
and
--
and
insofar
as
and
i'm
asking
you
because
my
mind
is
wholly
undecided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
you
have
any
burden
on
the
basis
of
that
statement
that's
representing
all
the
creditors.
they're
claiming
that
the
--
either
the
record
shows
or
they
contend
that
it
--
it
should
be
permitted
to
show
a
company
that
creditors
will
be
paid
off
as
you
let
them
alone
and
don't
move
into
another
one.
but
they
--
they
won't
be
paid
off
if
you
move
one
to
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
--
i
can
understand
that,
if
you
put
it
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
can't
understand
why
--
maybe
we
should
as
to
why
we
have
held
anything
in
that
early
case
that
may
be
original
are
in
class
rules,
even
though
the
circumstances
in
fact
that
the
court
can
know,
that
one
court
will
pay
the
stockholders
in
full
without
jeopardize
--
i
mean
the
--
the
credit
is
in
full,
without
jeopardizing
the
stockholders.
he
knows
that.
but
i
can't
understand
why
--
why
we
should
read
the
statute
to
say
and
get
under
those
circumstances
that
are
--
it
has
to
go
into
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
maybe
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
but
i
don't
quite
understand
how
the
court
would
have
the
discretion
to
give
priority
to
one
group
of
creditors
over
another
but
the
law
doesn't
do
it.
and
if
there
is
to
be
a
purpose,
i
should
think
it's
supposed
to
be
fixed
by
law.
where
did
that
discretion
come
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
happen
to
know.
i
think
they're
offered
as
amendment
in
congress
on
that
very
question.
that
under
those
old
rules,
the
wage
earners
didn't
sometimes.
and
other
claimants
of
that
type
didn't
get
there.
the
court
wouldn't
give
it
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
be
wrong
but
the
amendment
i
offered
may
have
been
reference
to
another
matter.
but
as
i
recall
that
--
that
they
didn't
usually
get
it
over
time
on
receivership,
equity
receivership
and
bankruptcy,
regular
bankruptcy,
i
thought
was
provided.
but
how
do
you
get
around
the
fact
that
here
it's
been
taken
out
of
xi.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
mean
to
say
it
shouldn't
be
gotten
away
from
but
i
--
i
just
don't
quite
understand
how
you
could
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
stated
it.
i
was
not
sure
that
i
had
in
that
but
it
was
close
to
that.
i
forgot
exactly
what
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
within
what
ranges
can
a
judge
exercise
his
discretion
in
determining
the
purpose
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
raise
any
issues
of
fact
in
your
motion
to
make
a
x
proceedings
instead
xi?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
made
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
their
ground
was,
seemingly,
the
only
ground,
provisions
of
chapter
xi
do
not
apply
to
a
debtor
corporation
which
has
securities
outstanding
in
the
hands
of
the
public.
now,
i
understand
it
from
you
that
--
that
i
misunderstood
you.
that
that
is
not
your
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
petition,
you've
said,
you
transfer
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
allege
that
it
will
be
for
the
best
interest
of
the
stockholders
that
the
trustee
be
appointed
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
chapter
x
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
will
solve.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
on
the
basis
that
there's
some
discretionary
power
on
the
part
of
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
--
if
it
is
to
their
best
interest.
and
your
idea
is
that
the
judge
held,
as
it
seems
to
me
probably,
he
did
here.
that
it
was
for
the
best
interest
of
all,
both
stockholders
and
creditors
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
you
have
alleged
that
the
matter
be
transferred.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
--
was
there
any
offer
to
put
on
anymore
evidence
than
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
put
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
opinion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
read
his
opinion
at
one
face,
i
don't
have
to
suggest
this
moment
he
made
a
statement
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
you
believe
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
stockholders
and
the
creditors
that
the
matter
be
transferred.
justice
hugo
l.

all
right.
thank
you.
