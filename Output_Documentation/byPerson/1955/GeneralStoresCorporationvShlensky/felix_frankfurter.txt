justice

frankfurter
in
other
words,
it
was
then
that
the
arrangement
touched
only
these
unsecured
creditors
and
therefore,
if
general
stores
had
gone
on
with
the
business
subject
to
eventuality
of
the
(inaudible)
events
seems
nothing
new,
the
situation
of
the
stockholders
will
remain
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
these
the
representatives
coming
from
each

justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
--
wasn't
there
a
truth
meaning
it's
solely
for
himself
that
was
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
i
want
to
know
that
the
stockholder
--
whether
the
stockholders
were
the
bargainers
objected
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
chapter
xi
arrangement
or
whether
the
--
whether
the
suit
really
is
with
the
security
and
exchange
commission
representing
its
note
within
the
public
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rosen,
your
burden
to
establish
that
or
proceeding
under
chapter
x
is
forbidden
by
chapter
x,
in
order
to
establish
the
--
an
arrangement
under
chapter
xi
is
allowable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
your
position
is
it
couldn't,
not
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that'll
be
between
x
and
xi
which
is
--
which
is
allowable
as
in
xi
--
chapter
xi
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
the
ultimate
that
would
be
here
suppose
the
security
that
the
district
court
in
that
case
in
the
--
under
the
facts
of
that
case
was
entitled
--
would
exercise
the
jurisdiction
preceded
of
entertaining
this
with
chapter
xi
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
that
that
was
not
on
abuse
of
discretion
that
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
reversing
that
was
in
error.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
it
gets
down
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
this
case
--
in
this
case,
the
district
court
admitted
--
the
district
in
this
case
--
the
district
court
exercised
its
jurisdiction
not
to
entertain
chapter
xi.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
say
that
--
did
you
say
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
judge
dimock
couldn't
exercise
discretion
was
so
compelled
when
you
raises
the
question
whether
he
was
concerned.
while
this
is
--
was
an
exercise
of
discretion
whether
we
have
the
question
whether
the
district
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
stockholders'
interest
were
involved
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
realty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
think
your
case
was
different
or
this
case
was
different
if
the
ordinary
creditors
opposed
it
--
the
arrangement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
it
would
have
to
go
to
adjudication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
wouldn't
the
term
which
you
--
which
has
now
been
offered
which
the
creditors
are
accepting
under
the
chapter
xi,
be
terms
available
under
chapter
x
because
of
fair
and
equitable
would
be
a
part?
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither
proportions
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
may
have
to
be
a
risk
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
policy
would
be
ready.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
looked
at
the
petitioner
here.
and
you
say
this
individual
name
is
not
applied
to
and
not
a
representative
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
wouldn't
be
plus
if
whatever
construction
was
difficult
except
for
a
language,
we
can
reconstruct
the
language
(inaudible)
i
mean
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
language
whatever
that
conveys.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
really
troubled
by
the
word
"plus."
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
we
take
judicial
notice
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
fact
stockholders
(inaudible)
is
very
often
is
a
representative
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
couldn't
in
the
big
and
small
public
or
private
only
that
it's
come
out
of
in
the
fourth
company
between
the
other
venues
of
chapter
xi
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
it
be
in
respect
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
it
here
in
active
(inaudible)
involved
the
public
corporations
and
necessary
to
go
under
its
hem
instead
of
going
to
--
would
that
be
a
good
handle
for
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
would
it
take
too
much
of
your
time.
if
it
does
then
(inaudible)
my
question?
could
you
quickly
say
and
this
is
your
expert
knowledge,
the
proceeding
what
would
happen,
just
outline
politically
as
in
outline,
how
the
proceeding
will
go
forward
if
this
were
left
to
xi,
and
what
would
happen
if
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
be
--
you'll
be
the
judge
from
an
answer
to
that
question
and
the
time
it
would
take
(inaudible)
on
the
argument
of
your
plan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
proceeding
were
meant
to
of
just
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
you
can
take
whatever
means
of
federal
district
judge
can
and
after
the
proceedings
to
put
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
this
(inaudible)
in
upholding
this.
he
gets
an
ample
opportunity
to
put
in
all
of
the
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
happened
in
the
transition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
justice
felix
frankfurter
--i
must
say
that
to
me
it
seems
odd,
is
they
wanted
to
legislate
into
(inaudible)
provide
that
this
applies
to
more
corporations
which
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
certain.
you're
making
it
hard
for
me
to
do
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
congress
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
which
report
is
that?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
234.
all
right.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
this
--
is
your
position
the
position
of
the
commission.
in
that
way
you
have
whatever
the
big
corporation
used
(inaudible)
or
outstanding
public
utility
than
an
xi
may
suppose
and
it's
much
broader
plan.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
going
to
ask
you
whether
the
court
point
at
the
public
to
hold
whether
it's
too
small
and
i
find
that
the
case
to
which
you
refer,
judge
(inaudible)
333
under
the
private
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
petition,
is
there
any
suggestion
of
an
organization
of
funds
or
a
misconduct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
--
and
if
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
and
this
has
to
go
into
x,
what
will
go
into
x
would
be
the
plan
that
is
now
in
its
(inaudible)
being
xi
at
the
same
time,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
anything
that
ended
in
the
corporation,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicate
anything
else
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
transvision,
there
was
suggestions
of
--
of
dubious
conducts
by
the
management.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
know
is
that
i
read
their
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
make
a
small
minority
holdings
more
at
the
risk
of
the
management
and
it's
through
the
light
of
distribution
and
management
hasn't
such
a
grip.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
what
you've
read
are
two
more
sentences
goes
before
and
after
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
prove
that
it
is
the
majority
of
the
court
to
see.
it
is
deemed
to
be
an
exercise
and
that's
going
to
be
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
the
jurisdiction
is
exclusive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
my
understanding
what
the
realty
case
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
reich
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
control
of
that.
if
i
may
sense
more
accurately,
the
decision
was
the
realty
upholds.
i'm
going
to
ask
you
if
i
read
the
record
now
that
i
have
the
report
in
front
of
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
amendment
of
52
gives
as
well
as
to
--
to
try
again
by
pointing
that
(inaudible)
from
xi
to
x
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you're
drawing
out
and
you
have
to
start
all
over
again
with
all
the
difficulty
that
the
x
transferred
from
x
to
xi.
and
you
refill
that
gap
by
allowing
to
transfer
instead
of
a
dismissal
whether
you
will
be
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
assume,
is
in
fact
the
decision.
