mr.
leon
singer
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
official
creditors
committee.
the
creditors
in
this
case
comprise
in
the
main
three
groups.
one
merchandise
and
service
creditors,
the
second
group,
the
former
employees
that
mr.
goldweber
mentioned.
and
the
third
group,
landlords
on
rejected
leases.
now,
we've
joined
even
though,
we're
normally,
we
are
a
respondent
in
the
prayer
of
the
debtor
for
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
leon
singer
we
represent
all,
as
the
official
creditors
committee.
mr.
leon
singer
we
represent
all
--
mr.
leon
singer
--
including
the
wage
earners
--
mr.
leon
singer
--
on
their
unsecured
claims.
now,
the
creditors
in
this
case
feel
that
the
decisions
below
are
oddly
irreconcilable
with
fundamental
principle
of
bankruptcy
in
corporate
law.
and
that
is
of
the
rights
of
stockholders
whether
of
a
close
corporation
or
whether
of
a
corporation
whose
stock
is
publicly
owned
is
always
subordinate
to
the
rights
of
creditors.
throughout
the
decisions
below,
it
would
seem
that
the
courts
were
more
concerned
with
the
protection
of
the
stockholders
than
the
protection
of
the
creditors.
now,
any
plan
whether
it's
one
of
reorganization
under
a
chapter
x
or
whether
it's
one
of
arrangement
under
chapter
xi,
must
we
submit
these
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors.
and
the
creditors
in
this
case
believe
that
their
interest
would
be
best
served
if
these
proceedings
continue
in
chapter
xi.
and
it
shall
be
my
burden
to
demonstrate
that
point.
now,
simply
to
hold
that
a
large
corporation
whose
stock
is
publicly
owned
may
not
avail
itself
of
the
privilege
of
obtaining
an
extension
of
payment
or
for
that
matter
a
composition
of
its
debts
does
violence
to
the
very
intent
and
purpose
of
chapter
xi
which
concededly
was
to
permit
an
adjustment
of
unsecured
debts
with
a
minimum
of
delay
and
a
minimum
of
expense.
otherwise,
it
would
seem,
if
it
may
please
the
court,
would
be
tantamount
to
forcing
such
a
corporation
to
a
choice
between
an
involved
chapter
x
proceeding
or
liquidation
and
straight
bankruptcy,
notwithstanding,
that
there
may
not
be
present
either
a
need
or
a
desire
or
a
possibility
of
reorganization.
now,
the
effect
of
the
decisions
below,
if
i
may
suggest
to
your
honors,
would
require
a
large
listed
corporation
with
stock
publicly
owned
whose
assets,
and
if
i
may
paraphrase
the
standards
suggested
by
judge
frank
below,
whose
assets
are
in
excess
of
a
million
dollars,
perfectly
solvent,
otherwise,
and
as
to
which
there
isn't
the
faintest
suspicion
of
the
conduct
of
management
and
which
for
example
desired
and
required
an
extension
of
its
bank
obligations
or
which
may
desire
or
require,
let
us
say,
a
composition
or
adjustment
of
damage
claims
which
may
have
arisen
out
of
an
action
on
anticipatory
breach
of
contract
where
the
corporation
concededly
receive
no
benefit.
and
even
though
that
that
class
of
creditors,
a
majority,
may
have
indicated
a
willingness
to
extend
credit
to
such
a
corporation.
if
the
decision
below
stands,
that
corporation
must
go
through
the
involved
cumbersome
expensive
procedures
of
a
chapter
x.
i
don't
believe
this
court
intended
that
in
the
realty
case
and
certainly,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
which
says
it.
mr.
leon
singer
that
is
the
point
i'm
now
arriving
at,
judge
black.
mr.
leon
singer
this
record
discloses
that
the
liquid
assets
of
this
debtor,
presently,
are
insufficient
to
pay
unsecured
creditors
to
the
full
extent
of
their
claims.
that
is
in
the
record
and
it
became
apparent
to
the
creditors
committee.
and
the
creditors
committee
indicated
a
willingness
to
accept
less
than
a
hundred
cents
on
the
dollar.
now,
if
we
are
forced
into
a
chapter
x
proceeding
where
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
is
a
requisite
(inaudible)
obvious.
we're
forced
either
with
liquidation
or
the
acceptance,
perhaps,
of
some
form
of
preferred
stock
or
a
long
deferred
payment
of
these
debts
and
i
haven't
any
hesitance
in
saying
to
this
court,
i
feel
that
neither
a
plan
which
will
give
to
unsecured
creditors
preferred
stock
in
this
corporation,
on
which
will
require
them
to
wait
years
and
years
for
payment
of
their
debts
will
receive
the
required
two-thirds
necessary
in
a
chapter
x.
mr.
leon
singer
i
--
i
feel
that
is
so.
certainly,
--
mr.
leon
singer
the
proportions,
they
would
have
to
be
so
--
as
judge
stone
say,
“you
have
to
eliminate
the
stockholders
to
apply
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding.”
now,
--
mr.
leon
singer
that
is
a
risk.
mr.
leon
singer
definitely,
so.
now,
i
think
there's
another
great
risk.
the
--
there
is
a
very
substantial
(inaudible)
in
this
case
which
is
subjected
to
parole.
and
that
is
the
stock
of
the
two
subsidiaries.
there
is
an
equity
of
$2,000,000
in
those
subsidiaries.
but
there
is
still
unpaid
approximately
$2,000,000
of
the
original
purchase
for
them.
and
that
stock
is
held
by
a
trustee
and
there
is
a
record
foreclosure
of
that
security
if
we're
going
to
a
x.
i
say
there's
a
threatened
foreclosure
because
the
trustee
has
specifically
waived
the
right
to
foreclose
pending
termination
of
these
proceedings
with
the
hope
that
we'd
be
able
to
work
something
else
in
arrangement.
now,
the
commission
suggests
that,
well
we
shouldn't
be
bothered
by
that
threat
because
the
district
court
has
the
power
to
restrain
such
a
foreclosure.
i
agree
that
the
district
court
has
such
power.
but
that
power
rests
in
discretion.
and
there's
no
warranty
that
the
discretion
would
be
exercised
in
favor
of
a
stay.
the
commission
also
suggests
that
the
trade
creditors
could
voluntarily
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding,
agree
to
accept
payment
of
their
claims
at
a
discount.
i
say
that,
that's
not
so
because
absent
the
consent
of
every
single
creditor
in
the
chapter
x
proceeding,
notwithstanding,
that
the
required
two-thirds
had
consented
to
take
less
in
the
chapter
x
proceeding
under
the
doctrine
of
this
court
in
the
case
against
los
angeles.
even
though
the
two-thirds
it
so
agreed,
the
plan
would
fall
of
confirmation.
now,
we
justly
feel
that
we
will
be
prejudiced
by
further
delay
and
further
dissipation
of
the
assets
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
it
may
have
been
suggested
by
a
question
asked.
i
think
that
had
not
these
interim
appeals,
this
litigation
with
respect
to
our
right
to
have
remained
in
chapter
xi
intervened,
the
debtor,
by
now,
would
have
had
its
plan
of
arrangement
confirmed
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events.
i
should
like
to
--
to
add
one
further
point.
if
as
judge
frank
suggests,
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
it's
necessary
to
establish
monetary
standards
to
determine
what
is
a
large
corporation
and
what
is
not
a
large
corporation,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
circuit
court
is
suggesting
something
which
congress,
in
the
first
instance,
should
have
put
in
the
act.
and
the
very
fact
that
judge
frank
saw
it
necessary
to
delineate
what
standards
constitute
a
large
corporation
and
what
do
not
i
think
bares
out
the
fallacy
of
the
opinion
itself.
best
to
force
this
doubt
into
a
reorganization
whereas
judge
(inaudible)
points
out,
there's
nothing
to
reorganize,
can
bring
about
only
a
liquidation
of
the
debtor
to
the
detriment
of
its
creditors
and
to
the
complete
elimination
of
its
stockholders
who
bought
for
one
representing,
as
mr.
rosen
point
out,
two-tenths
of
1%
of
the
entire
capital
stock
of
indicated
no
desire
to
reorganize
this
corporation.
mr.
leon
singer
well
no,
sir.
insofar
as
this
record
discloses,
this
petition
was
made
by
mr.
shlensky
in
his
own
right
which
the
statute
gives
him.
mr.
leon
singer
and
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
was
required
to
be
notified
under
the
statute
upon
the
making
of
the
motion.
mr.
leon
singer
so
far
as
--
mr.
leon
singer
insofar
as
this
has
come
to
our
attention
judge,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
leon
singer
the
record
does
not
show
--
mr.
leon
singer
that
is
correct.
the
record
shows
that
other
than
this
particular
stockholder,
no
other
stockholder,
i'm
assuming,
in
the
absence
of
s.e.c.
has
taken
any
part
or
position
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
leon
singer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
