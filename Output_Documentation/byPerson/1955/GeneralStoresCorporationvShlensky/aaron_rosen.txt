mr.
aaron
rosen
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
certiorari
for
the
court
of
appeals
second
circuit.
the
petitioner,
general
stores
corporation,
seeks
to
reverse
the
--
the
decision
by
an
--
a
divided
bench
of
that
court
which
affirmed
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
debtor
in
this
case,
which
filed
the
petition
on
arrangement
under
chapter
xi
of
the
bankruptcy
act
with
its
unsecured
commercial
and
trade
creditors,
cannot
proceed
in
chapter
xi
unless
the
debtor
amended
its
petition
to
comply
with
the
requirements
for
a
corporate
reorganization
under
chapter
x.
in
filing
its
petition
for
an
arrangement
under
chapter
xi,
the
debtor
was
seeking
first
an
extension
of
time
for
the
payment
of
its
general,
unsecured
and
commercial
trade
debts,
and
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceeding,
it
hoped
to
obtain
the
liquidation
of
the
balance
of
its
very
burdensome
leases.
general
stores
was
formerly
known
as
the
d.
a.
schulte,
inc.
it
operated
a
large
chain
of
the
small
shops
selling
tobacco
and
sundry
offers.
as
a
result
of
the
gradual
change
in
merchandising
in
that
type
of
business
and
perhaps
the
borrowing
habits
of
the
public,
the
company
decided
that
if
it
continued
in
that
type
of
business
it
meant
financial
disaster.
it
decided
that
it
would
be
necessary
that
it
acquire
successfully,
established
chain
drugstore
outlets.
this
aim,
on
the
part
of
the
debtor
company,
was
accomplished
in
1953,
and
in
1954,
by
the
purchase
for
some
$4
million
of
the
ford
hopkins
company
that
had
about
56
or
57
chains
of
drugstores.
and
the
purchase
of
the
stineway
company
that
had
approximately
the
same
number
of
retail
drugstores.
now,
the
acquisition
of
these
two
successfully
established
chains
indicated
to
the
debtor
company
a
return
of
approximately
17%
on
the
investment
or
the
rather
the
purchase
price.
and
it
should
be
noted
that
this
17%
was
anticipated
to
be
a
net
return,
a
close
to
a
net
return
because
of
the
benefits
of
the
tax
laws
carry
forward
that
the
company
hoped
to
obtain.
the
continued
operation
by
the
debtor
of
its
remaining
used
units
that
it
had
and
the
very
substantial
expense
that
was
occasioned
by
its
burdensome
leases
was
gradually
resulting
in
a
point
arriving
where
it
was
unable
to
pay
its
commercial
and
trade
debts
as
they
were
maturing.
in
order
to
obtain
the
relief
from
its
inability
to
pay
its
commercial
debts
as
they
were
maturing,
this
debtor
filed
a
petition
for
an
arrangement
under
chapter
xi.
general
stores
is
a
public
stock
corporation.
it
has
but
one
class
of
stock,
common.
the
stock
is
traded
on
the
american
stock
exchange.
part
of
the
stock
is
registered
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
there
are
about
2
million
shares
of
this
common
stock
outstanding
that
has
a
par
value
of
$1
a
share.
and
there
are
approximately
7000
shareholders
in
all,
the
public.
now,
except
for
this
common
stock
issue,
there
is
no
other
stock
or
security
whatsoever
issued
by
this
debtor.
at
the
time
that
the
petition
was
filed
for
an
arrangement,
the
debtor
owed
about
$2
million
to
the
former
owners
of
the
stock
of
the
ford
hopkins
company.
this
debt,
which
represented
the
balance
owing
on
the
purchase
price,
was
secured
by
all
of
the
stock
of
the
ford
hopkins
company
and
by
all
of
the
stock
of
the
stineway
drug
company.
this
is
the
only
secured
debt.
and,
of
course,
this
obligation
to
this
secured
creditor
was
not
to
be
affected
by
the
proposed
plan
of
arrangement.
in
addition,
this
debtor
owed
to
general
unsecured,
merchandise
and
trade
creditors
an
amount
somewhat
in
excess
of
$500,000.
it
also
owed
to
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
the
stineway
drug
company
$1,300,000
representing
moneys
borrowed
from
time
to
time
from
that
company.
the
assets
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
amounted
to
about
$5
million
and
consisted
of
the
capital
stock
of
the
two
wholly
owned
subsidiaries,
the
ford
hopkins
and
the
stineway
drug
at
about
$4
million
an
inventory
cash
and
other
miscellaneous
assets
of
about
$1,000,000.
now,
the
plan
of
arrangement
filed
by
the
general
stores
proposed
an
extension
only
for
the
payment
of
its
generally
unsecured
merchandise
and
trade
debts
as
follows.
20%
in
cash
upon
the
confirmation
of
the
plan,
20%
annually
thereafter
over
the
next
four-year
period
and
the
only
obligations
affected
by
this
propose
plan
of
the
general
unsecured
commercial
and
trade
debts.
they're
represented
here
by
the
creditors
committee
and
by
the
attorney
for
the
wage
claimants.
the
commission
moved
in
the
district
court.
mr.
aaron
rosen
exactly,
sir.
and
there
were
no
other
security
holders
of
any
kind.
now,
the
commission
moved
in
the
district
court
for
leave
to
intervene
in
the
chapter
xi
proceedings.
and
it
asked
that
the
petition
be
dismissed
which
was
filed
for
an
arrangement
unless
it
was
amended
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
chapter
x
for
corporate
reorganization
as
we
understand
it.
now,
the
reasons
advanced
by
the
commission
and
the
basis
of
its
motion
is
its
contention
that
chapter
xi
is
not
available
for
corporations
with
publicly
held
securities.
mr.
aaron
rosen
no,
sir.
mr.
shlensky
represented
two-tenths
of
one
percent
of
the
outstanding
stock.
mr.
aaron
rosen
i
believe
it
may
have
been
in
this
represented
capacity.
i
don't
know
that
detail,
sir.
it
was
merely
an
allegation
on
this
one.
mr.
aaron
rosen
i
--
i
can
say
--
mr.
aaron
rosen
well,
i
--
i
can
best
answer
that
question
this
way.
after
this
stockholder,
shlensky
started
the
proceedings
then
for
the
first
time,
that
the
security
and
exchange
commission
stepped
in
the
case.
it
was
made
a
party
to
the
proceedings
by
the
motion
of
this
small
stockholder.
the
district
court
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
granted
the
motion
of
the
commission
on
the
grounds
that
a
large
corporation
with
publicly
held
stock
may
not
have
an
arrangement
--
may
not
have
an
arrangement
with
unsecured
creditors
regardless
of
the
plan
through
chapter
xi
proceedings
but
that
it
must
resort
to
a
corporate
reorganization
through
chapter
x
so
that
the
appraisal
of
the
commission
could
be
obtained
by
the
court.
neither
of
the
courts
below
found
any
express
statutory
provision
in
chapter
xi
which
excludes
a
large
corporation
with
publicly
held
stock
from
seeking
an
arrangement
with
general
unsecured
commercial
and
trade
creditors.
both
courts
and
the
commission
in
this
court
rely
exclusively
upon
their
interpretation
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
u.s.
realty
case.
we
believe
that
it
must
be
conceded
that
nowhere
in
chapter
xi
is
it
expressly
provided
that
large
corporations
with
publicly
held
stock
issues
cannot
file
a
petition
for
an
arrangement
under
that
chapter.
and
we
believe
that
it
must
further
be
conceded
that
on
--
on
at
least
three
occasions,
congress
was
faced
with
the
suggestion
to
so
legislate
and
congress
refused
to
do
so.
the
first
occasion
was
in
the
formative
stages
of
the
chandler
act
in
1936.
at
that
time
a
special
committee
of
congress
recommended
that
the
acting
clue
to
provision
that
large
corporations
with
publicly
held
stock
of
over
100
stockholders
should
not
be
or
should
be
excluded
from
the
benefits
of
chapter
xi.
it
was
not
enacted.
the
second
occasion
was
in
1940
after
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
u.s.
realty
case
held
that
there
was
no
exclusion
in
chapter
xi
from
the
large
corporations
with
publicly
held
securities.
at
that
time,
a
bill
was
introduced
in
congress
to
exclude
such
corporations
from
the
benefit
of
chapter
xi.
congress
again
failed
to
enact
any
such
exclusion.
the
third
occasion
was
in
1952,
and
that
was
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
u.s.
realty
case.
and
particularly
after
it
was
noted
from
mr.
justice
stone's
pointing
it
out
in
the
u.s.
realty
case
that
there
was
a
lack
in
the
statute
of
any
definition
of
a
large
corporation
with
publicly
held
securities
on
which
definition
the
court
could
find
the
basis
for
an
exclusion.
congress
at
that
time
codified
one
aspect
of
the
u.s.
realty
decision
but
again
failed
to
enact
in
chapter
xi
any
exclusion
against
large
corporations
with
publicly
held
securities.
mr.
aaron
rosen
had
this
corporation
filed
a
petition
for
reorganization
under
chapter
x
seeking
in
that
proceeding,
only
an
adjustment
or
extension
of
its
commercial
and
trade
debts,
it
would
not
have
been
filed
in
good
faith.
and
the
statute
says
that
when
the
court
receives
a
petition
for
reorganization
and
before
it
approves
it,
it
must
find
that
it's
filed
in
good
faith.
mr.
aaron
rosen
correct.
mr.
aaron
rosen
yes,
sir.
and
as
i'd
like
to
finish
my
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
considered
bad
faith
if
the
relief
requested
under
chapter
x,
had
this
company
filed
the
petition
for
reorganization,
could
have
been
granted
under
chapter
xi.
now,
if
i
may,
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
exclusion
of
large
corporations
with
publicly
held
securities,
what
are
the
substantive
criteria
for
dismissing
a
proceeding
in
chapter
xi
which
would
justify
excluding
certain
corporations?
the
only
substantive
rule
for
dismissing
a
petition
is,
and
it
always
has
been,
contained
right
within
the
act
in
section
376
and
section
366
of
chapter
xi.
section
376
empowers
the
court
to
dismiss
the
petition
wherever
the
plan
fails
of
confirmation.
section
366
states
the
conditions
of
confirmation.
now,
the
conditions
for
confirmation
at
the
time
of
the
u.s.
realty
case
was
that
the
court
be
satisfied
that
the
plan
was
fair
and
equitable
and
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors
also
feasible.
at
that
time,
if
the
court
was
not
satisfied
in
either
point,
the
plan
could
not
be
confirmed.
and
the
court
was
empowered
to
dismiss
the
proceedings
right
in
the
section
376.
this
was
statutory
law
and
that
was
the
law
we
submit
which
the
majority
of
this
court
applied
in
the
u.s.
realty
case.
as
a
matter
of
substantive
law,
the
majority
opinion
stated
that
the
most
important
consideration
was
that
the
plan
by
affecting
unsecured
guarantee
of
the
mortgage
certificate
holders
without
compensating
advantage,
contributed
--
contributed
by
stockholders
couldn't
confirm
such
a
plan
under
any
circumstances
because
it
was
not
fair
and
equitable
under
the
boyd
and
the
case
in
los
--
los
angeles
lumber
case.
secondarily,
the
court
said,
and
found,
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
that
in
view
of
the
securities
act
of
1933,
it
could
not
be
satisfied
as
to
what
was
for
the
best
interest
of
creditor
without
an
appraisal
and
a
report
from
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
who,
under
the
securities
act
of
1933,
were
the
special
guardians
of
the
particular
creditors
that
were
affected
by
the
plan
in
the
u.s.
realty
case.
now,
what
is
there
in
the
u.s.
realty
case
which
could
justify
this
court
in
excluding
the
general
stores
from
the
benefits
of
chapter
xi
on
the
facts,
the
two
cases
are
entirely
different.
the
decision
in
the
u.s.
realty
case,
i
submit,
was
based
on
the
facts
peculiar
for
that
case.
the
plan
that
was
submitted
in
that
case
had
a
direct
and
adverse
effect
on
the
public
security
holders
that
held
the
guarantee
issued
by
the
security
--
by
the
u.s.
realty
company.
mr.
aaron
rosen
i
agree.
mr.
aaron
rosen
i
agree.
mr.
aaron
rosen
thats
correct,
and
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
it.
mr.
aaron
rosen
judge
dimock
is
correct.
mr.
aaron
rosen
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
strongly
submit
that
nowhere
in
the
statute
is
there
any
such
discretion
granted
to
the
court.
nowhere
in
the
statute
is
a
large
corporation
with
publicly
held
securities
excluded
from
the
benefits
of
chapter
xi.
and
the
discretion
that
was
discussed
in
the
u.s.
realty
company
case,
we
interpret
as
being
entirely
different.
where
there
are
public
security
holders
affected
by
a
propose
plan
of
arrangement,
then,
the
court
has
the
discretion
of
saying,
“well,
i
can
determine
now,
whether
or
not,
it's
for
the
best
interest
of
creditors
which
i'm
required
to
do
in
my
discretion.
however,
if
it's
a
simple
case,
i'll
do
it.
if
it's
a
complicated
case
with
many
stockholders,
i
prefer
to
exercise
my
discretion
that
the
security
and
exchange
commission
shall
step
into
the
matter
because
they're
the
guardians
of
that
particular
class
of
creditors.
and
give
me
the
benefit
of
their
appraisal
as
to
what
they
think
should
or
should
not
be
done
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors."
in
that
case
at
that
time,
you
also
had
the
fair
and
equitable
rule.
but
the
discretion,
i
think,
from
a
careful
analysis
of
the
decision
was
not
whether
a
large
corporation
with
publicly
held
securities
should
be
excluded.
mr.
aaron
rosen
in
the
--
mr.
aaron
rosen
in
the
realty
case,
not
stockholders.
it
was
guaranteed
certificate
holders
and
it
was
the
only
class
of
creditor
affected,
the
only
class.
now,
we
maintain
that
the
moving
consideration
were
it
excluding
the
u.s.
realty
company
from
the
benefits
of
chapter
xi,
was
of
the
fact
that
its
plan
directly
and
adversely
affected,
the
unsecured
guarantee
certificate
holders
as
i
mentioned.
the
commission,
on
the
other
hand,
denies
that
it
was
the
plan
which
was
the
moving
consideration
for
the
u.s.
realty
decision.
instead
it
contends
it
was
a
fact
that
the
u.s.
realty
company
was
a
large
corporation
with
publicly
held
stock
which
constituted
the
moving
consideration
for
excluding
it
from
the
benefits
of
chapter
xi.
mr.
aaron
rosen
if
the
ordinary
creditors
oppose
the
arrangements,
there
isn't
any
--
quite
you
mean
the
commercial
and
trade
credit?
mr.
aaron
rosen
it
could
never
be
confirmed.
this
would
automatically
be
dismissed
or
adjudicated,
whichever
the
court
determines
after
a
hearing
is
for
the
best
interest
of
creditors.
mr.
aaron
rosen
not
necessarily.
under
the
act,
where
a
plan
for
the
adjustment
or
settlement
of
general
unsecured
trade
creditors,
is
not
confirmed
because
for
whatever
the
reason
may
be,
as
permitted
under
section
366,
then
the
court
holds
a
hearing
and
determines
what's
best
for
creditors.
shall
i
direct
an
adjudication
and
the
distribution
of
assets
maintain
the
possibility
of
preference
actions
or
such
or
shall
i
dismiss
it?
where
will
the
benefit
of
creditors
best
protected?
that's
what
the
court
is
required
to
do.
now,
unless
the
commission
is
correct
in
its
interpretation
of
the
u.s.
realty
case,
that
case
cannot
be
controlling
in
ours.
mr.
justice
stone
stated
in
the
u.s.
realty
case
that
most
important
in
his
determination
is
that
--
is
the
fact
that
the
plan
proposed
by
the
u.s.
realty
did
violence
to
the
fair
and
equitable
rule.
and
that
chapter
xi
was
inadequate
to
affect
stockholders
who
would,
of
necessity,
be
affected
by
any
plan
of
arrangement.
of
course,
you
just
couldn't
comply
with
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
as
the
law
then
existed.
mr.
aaron
rosen
in
both
--
mr.
aaron
rosen
it
was,
sir.
and
in
1952,
the
fair
and
equitable
requirement
was
removed
from
section
xi
as
a
requirement
for
confirmation
of
the
plan.
mr.
aaron
rosen
well,
i
--
i
believe
--
i
think
it
will
be
discussed,
sir.
mr.
justice
stone
further
stated
that
it
didn't
appear
--
did
not
appear
that
any
plan
could
be
proposed
under
the
fair
and
equitable
requirement
which
didn't
affect
stockholders.
it
just
hadn't.
because
you
couldn't
tear
down
or
pay
less
to
general
creditors
under
that
rule
without
some
compensating
benefit
being
paid
by
the
stockholders.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
majority
holding
in
the
u.s.
realty
case
is
based
upon
the
inadequacy
of
chapter
xi
to
confirm
the
plan
that
was
presented
by
the
u.s.
realty
company
in
that
case.
and
mr.
justice
stone,
after
making
the
observations
which
existed
in
that
case
that
chapter
xi
was
not
intended
for
the
large
corporation
with
public
securities,
said,
"still
more
important
are
the
differences
in
the
remedies
obtainable
under
the
two
chapters
which
results
from
the
differences
in
the
nature
of
the
two
proceedings
and
in
the
securities
affected
by
them.
we
believe
that
we're
confirmed
in
our
opinion
as
to
the
basis
of
the
u.s.
realty
decision
by
the
fact
that
congress,
in
1952,
changed
the
standards
for
confirming
a
plan
in
chapter
xi,
rather
than
in
enacting
any
legislation
which
would
exclude
large
corporations
with
publicly
held
stock
from
the
benefits
of
that
chapter.
this
court
in
the
u.s.
realty
case
pointed
out
that
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
as
i
stated
made
it
almost
impossible
to
confirm
a
plan
of
arrangement
without
affecting
stockholders
who
therefore,
must
be
permitted
to
become
parties
to
the
proceedings.
and
that
couldn't
be
done
under
chapter
xi.
in
1952,
congress
removed
the
fair
and
equitable
requirement
for
confirmation
of
arrangements
under
chapter
xi.
and
it
removed
the
necessity
for
making
stockholders
parties
affected
by
the
proceeding.
well,
i
--
i
see
that
my
time
is
getting
very
close
and
i
would
like
to
state,
if
i
may
to
the
court,
the
five
important
points
that
we
stress
for
the
reversal
of
the
court
below.
the
first
is,
that
there's
nothing
contained
in
the
statute
which
excludes
large
corporations
with
publicly
held
securities
from
the
benefits
of
chapter
xi.
my
second
point
is,
the
only
substantive
criteria
for
the
dismissal
of
petitions
under
chapter
xi
are
contained
within
the
law
itself,
section
376
and
section
366
as
i
mentioned
before.
my
third
point
is
that,
the
court,
this
court
in
the
u.s.
realty
case
did
not
add
to
the
criteria
for
dismissal.
it
merely
applied
the
existing
law.
and
my
fourth
point
is
that
the
result
in
the
u.s.
realty
case
does
not
apply
to
our
case
at
all,
because
as
justice
stone
stated
in
the
u.s.
realty
case,
the
important
consideration
is
the
plan
which
adversely
affected
the
public
security
holders.
and
my
last
and
final
point,
is
that
the
1952
amendment,
which
is
section
328,
did
not
add
any
additional
criteria
for
the
dismissal
of
the
petition
by
--
by
saying
large
corporations
are
excluded
or
certain
types
of
corporations
are
excluded.
it
merely
added
a
procedural
remedy
from
that
portion
of
the
u.s.
realty
case
which
was
codified
and
nothing
else.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
aaron
rosen
(inaudible)
mr.
aaron
rosen
if
the
court
please.
with
the
--
with
respect
to
certain
questions
which
the
court
had,
may
we
point
out
that
a
description
of
the
proceeding
in
chapter
xi
is
contained
in
at
page
23
of
our
brief.
in
that
case
we
show
how
extremely
wrong
it
is
to
make
the
statement
that
all
the
proceedings
in
chapter
xi
are
under
the
control
of
the
debtor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
once
a
debtor
files
his
petition
in
chapter
xi,
the
proceeding
moves
under
the
control
of
the
court
and
the
creditors
as
represented
by
the
creditors
committee.
now,
we
believe
that
is
one
of
the
most
important
distinctions
from
the
way
the
case
is
being
argued
by
the
s.e.c.and
by
the
stockholder
shlensky.
in
other
words,
we,
representing
the
debtor,
are
here
between
if
you
like
to
fire
us.
we
have
the
creditors
who,
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
have
real
control
over
this
chapter
xi
proceeding.
and
on
the
other
side,
we
have
the
s.e.c.who,
regardless
of
the
interest
of
creditors
as
expressed
by
them,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
can
be
so
easily
shown
that
stockholders
get
a
worse
deal
in
this
type
of
case
in
chapter
x,
nevertheless,
move
ahead
and
ask
that
we
go
into
chapter
x.
the
stockholder
shlensky,
petitioning
in
his
own
behalf,
not
joined
by
anybody
else
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
the
stockholders
are
with
him.
in
fact
the
record
shows
just
the
opposite.
the
record
shows
that
the
things
that
shlensky
is
unhappy
about,
the
investments
in
the
new
enterprises
were
fully
presented
to
the
stockholders
with
proxy
statements
which
were
cleared
by
the
s.e.c.
and
then
not
a
small
block
of
management
stock
voted
for
it
but
the
stockholders
voted
four-to-one
and
there
are
7000
stockholders
outstanding.
now,
this
situation
is,
that
when
this
motion
was
made
below
in
the
district
court,
there
were
no
facts
shown.
as
they
said,
they
didn't
even
suggest
wrong
doing.
all
they
said
was,
“you're
in
the
wrong
chapter
because
you're
a
large
stockholder,
because
it's
a
large
corporation
with
publicly
held
stock
and
you
have
--
you
have
invested
in
this
new
drugstore
group
and
you're
getting
out
of
the
old.
as
if
a
matter
of
business
judgment
created
for
some
reason
or
other,
a
right
in
the
s.e.c.to
transfer
the
management
and
control
of
this
company
from
the
management
to
a
trustee.
now,
that's
in
effect
what
they're
trying
to
do
in
this
case.
now,
with
regard
to
--
and
i
only
have
time
just
for
the
u.s.
realty
case.
in
regard
to
the
u.s.
realty
case,
we
want
to
point
out
that
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
did
express
itself
in
terms
of
large
corporation
publicly
held,
what
not,
to
be
in
chapter
xi.
but
the
court
by
mr.
justice
stone,
did
not
point
out
the
statute,
the
basis
for
such
an
exclusion.
the
court
then
went
on,
and
this
is
what
we
feel
is
the
important
thing
about
the
u.s.
realty.
then
it
went
on
and
said
at
page
452
at
310
u.s.,
still
more
important
are
the
differences
in
the
remedies
obtainable
under
the
two
chapters
which
result
from
differences
in
the
nature
of
the
two
proceedings
and
in
the
securities
which
may
be
affected,
affected
by
the
two
proceedings.
and
then
mr.
justice
stone
starts
quoting
the
statute
and
what
does
he
quote?
366,
"the
standards
for
the
confirmation
of
a
plan
and
if
you
can't
confirm
a
plan,
congress
said,
the
court
has
the
power
to
dismiss."
now,
mr.
justice
roberts
wrote
the
dissent
in
that
case
and
expressed
himself
as
unsatisfied
with
the
proposition
that
a
court
in
bankruptcy
has
the
equity
power
to
withhold
rights
which
congress
has
given
to
the
people.
and
we
ask
that
that
matter
be
seriously
reviewed
by
this
court.
but
we
don't
believe
that
this
court
came
to
that
conclusion
in
the
u.s.
realty
case.
it
certainly
wasn't
necessary.
and
mr.
justice
stone
said
in
unmistakable
language,
what
was
the
most
important
consideration.
he
said,
what
was
the
basis
of
his
own
decision.
thank
you.
