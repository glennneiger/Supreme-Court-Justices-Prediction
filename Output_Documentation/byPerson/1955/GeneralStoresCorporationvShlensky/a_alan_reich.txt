mr.
a.
alan
reich
your
honor
pleases.
we
appear
here
today
on
behalf
of
an
individual
stockholder
who
has
proceeded
pursuant
of
provision
of
section
328
of
the
act
and
has
brought
on
by
order
to
show
cause
a
proceeding,
why
the
petitioner
should
not
show
cause,
why
a
proceeding
should
not
be
dismissed
unless
steps
are
taken
to
comply
with
provisions
of
chapter
x.
this
is
an
individual
stockholder
and
the
purpose
for
that
is
very
simple.
proceedings
have
been
initiated.
our
stockholder
was
unhappy,
asked
us
to
make
the
application.
there
was
no
time,
no
opportunity
to
convene
of
the
stockholders
and
there
was
no
necessity
or
requirement
under
the
statute
that
ought
to
be
done.
since
then
other
stockholders
have
spoken
with
us
with
relation
to
the
matter
and
have
indicated
some
interest
in
the
matter.
we
have
heard
from
no
stock
--
from
no
stockholder
any
desire
that
any
proceedings
be
taken
with
relation
to
this
matter
other
than
what
we
have
done.
our
stockholder
is
unhappy.
he
was
unhappy
when
the
creditors
were
offered
100
cents.
he
is
unhappy
at
this
particular
time
when
we
are
told
in
the
brief
that
creditors
may
accept
40%.
he
would
be
very
happy
if
he
knew
that
upon
payment
of
creditors
100
cents
on
a
dollar
or
40%
on
the
dollar,
his
rights
would
be
preserved.
his
equities
would
be
protected
and
that
the
amount
he
had
invested
in
stock
would
be
preserved
in
all
respects.
however,
he
doesn't
feel
that.
he
doesn't
know
at
this
particular
time
what
will
happen.
we
do
know
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
court
that
here
is
a
corporation
which
has
been
in
business
over
a
number
of
years.
then
in
77
(b),
out
of
77
(b),
issues
corporate
stock,
issues
additional
corporate
stock
and
we
find
ourselves
among
the
stockholders
at
this
particular
time.
we
find
that
in
1953,
when
certainly
they
must
have
been
feeling
the
pinch
capital
deficiency.
they
go
out
and
they
buy
additional
structures.
they
buy
the
stineway
drug
company
and
they
buy
this
corporation
which
sells
drugs
and
cosmetics
for
a
total
purchase
price
$4,220,000
of
which
$800,000
was
paid
in
cash.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
no
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
no,
sir.
we
say
that
we
do
not
allege
that
there's
any
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
officers.
we
indicate
that
there
is
a
strong
possibility
there
may
be
errors
in
the
judgment.
and
it's
our
feeling
at
this
particular
time
that
is
the
case.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
no.
the
issues,
the
way
we
raise
sir,
are
base
primarily
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
are
entitled
to
be
protected
by
the
safeguards,
set
for
us
under
chapter
x
rather
than
to
be
left
at
the
mercies
of
a
combination,
and
i
don't
make
an
improper
combination
by
use
of
the
word,
sir
between
the
creditors
committee
and
management.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
yes,
sir.
if
it
went
--
no,
sir.
may
i
just
withdraw
that?
it
would
--
if
it
went
into
x,
we
would
have
an
independent
trustee
who
would
in
the
first
instance
be
submitting
a
plan
and
that
is
one
of
the
distinctions
between
chapter
xi
and
chapter
x.
if
i
may
--
mr.
a.
alan
reich
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
well,
sir
we
--
we
don't
know
that
the
corporation
would
be
called
upon
to
submit
a
plan.
the
plan
would
be
submitted
by
the
disinterested
trustee.
and
if
i
may
go
back
a
moment
to
a
question
which
your
honor
asked
and
which
i
think
may
have
been
answered
a
little
incompletely,
the
book
was
followed
completely
but
in
the
practical
standpoint,
let
me
tell
your
honors
what
occurs
in
a
chapter
xi
proceeding.
when
a
chapter
xi
proceeding
is
filed,
the
major
activity
occurs
outside
of
the
courts.
a
meeting
will
generally
be
called
by
the
counsel
for
the
debtor
or
possibly
a
counsel
for
a
group
of
creditors.
at
that
time
those
creditors
who
were
invited,
and
there
is
no
statutory
requirement,
that
you
invite
more
than
a
handful.
but
let
us
assume
all
creditors
are
invited.
they
will
designate
a
creditors
committee.
the
creditors
committee
will
designate
its
own
accountant.
it
will
negotiate
with
the
debtor
and
on
the
basis
of
the
best
possible
arrangement
they
can
for
the
protection
of
creditors,
they
will
finally
come
up
with
a
plan
based
on
what
the
creditors
expect
to
receive
and
what
the
debtor
can
pay.
we
say,
that
under
--
that
arrangement
may
be
for
the
best
interest
of
creditors
but
does
not
necessarily
make
it
for
our
best
interest.
that
assuming,
for
example,
that
this
40%
is
paid,
that
that
40%
may
so
reduce
the
assets
of
this
debtor
as
to
leave
a
mere
(inaudible)
for
stockholders
and
simply
to
delay
the
time,
when
this
illusory
existence
of
ours,
of
stockholders
ceases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
opinion
of
judge
clark
in
referring
to
the
--
this
situation
says
in
our
view,
widespread
stockholder
interest
in
the
corporation
with
such
a
shaky
financial
history
as
this
one
in
itself,
is
in
itself
sufficient
ground
for
the
invocation
of
chapter
x
proceedings.
even
the
unsecured
creditors
who
are
urging
the
reinstatement
of
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
petition
may
come
to
regret
their
decision
during
the
interval
of
postponed
payment
without
interest
of
their
claim
for
the
present
proceedings
are
completely
in
the
control
of
the
debtor
corporation
on
whose
financial
acumen
and
bookkeeping
accuracy
must
rest
through
fairness
and
feasibility
of
the
proposed
arrangement.
too
a
greater
public
interest
is
here
at
stake
to
allow
the
present
management
of
the
debtor
to
secure
court
ratification
of
such
a
plan
without
having
available
to
all
parties
the
disinterested
appraisal
and
judgment
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
in
the
transvision
case
in
which
i
was
one
the
respondents,
the
position
was
entirely
different.
there
may
have
been
a
suggestion.
there
was
never
where
you
counsel
for
the
creditors
committee
is
of
that
corporation.
we
never
had
the
slightest
doubt.
even
though
the
s.e.c.raised
it
and
we're
on
the
other
side
from
the
s.e.c.
in
that
case.
there
was
never
in
our
mind
and
never
developed
in
any
of
our
investigation
the
slightest
doubt.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
yes,
sir.
i
say
that
with
respect
to
the
cases
that
we
have
here,
the
s.e.c.,
the
general
stores
and
the
transvision
cases.
and
we
must
confess
that
we
differ
with
the
s.e.c.
on
the
transvision
decision.
we
feel
that
general
stores
followed
the
u.s.
realty
case.
and
we
say
that
the
court,
in
refusing
certiorari
in
transvision,
likewise,
followed
the
u.s.
realty
case.
we
feel
that
the
matter
is
in
all
squares.
here
we
have
on
the
s.e.c.case
900,000
shares
of
stock.
in
general
stores,
we
have
2,232,000
shares
of
stock.
in
the
transvision
case,
however,
we
only
had
a
total
of
385,000
shares
of
common
stock
and
1773.5
shares
at
$100
apart.
now,
with
respect
to
the
distribution
in
the
realty
case
as
in
the
general
stores
case,
there
was
only
a
small
amount
of
stock
in
the
hands
of
the
management.
there
was
only,
in
this
case,
127,000
shares
as
against
the
2,232,mr.
justice
clark.
in
the
transvision
case,
also,
all
of
the
stock
was
in
the
hands
of
management.
it
was,
in
effect,
privately
held
with
the
exception
of
135,000
shares
of
stock.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
well,
sir,
we
have
this
particular
situation
where
management
itself
owns
a
small
block
of
stock
and
take
this
small
block
of
stock
and
uses
it
to
swing
the
corporation.
certainly,
there
is
less
possibility
of
danger
with
respect
to
corporation
as
the
courts
have
pointed
out.
then
where
a
--
the
management
itself
has
a
greater
financial
risk
will
be
hurt
by
its
own
actions
with
respect
to
the
liabilities.
the
liabilities
offered
from
the
guaranteed
liabilities
in
the
realty
case
was
$5,051,000
as
against
roughly
$4
million
dollars
in
this
case
and
only
$772,000.
the
assets
in
the
realty
case
were
over
$7
million.
in
this
case
over
$5
million.
in
the
transvision
case
only
$998,000.
i
believe
i
have
just
a
few
moments.
i'd
like
if
i
may
go
back
--
mr.
a.
alan
reich
oh,
fine.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
that's
just
fine.
the
court,
as
stated
in
the
realty
case,
was
given
the
right,
the
exercise
of
discretion.
it
was
contended
the
court
had
no
right
in
the
realty
case
to
determine
whether
a
matter
is
properly
in
x
or
xi.
and
the
court
in
the
realty
case
indicated
and
i
quote,
"in
this
situation
we
think
the
court
was
as
free
to
determine
whether
the
relief
reported
by
chapter
xi
was
adequate
as
it
would
have
been
if
respondent
had
filed
its
petition
under
chapter
x."
but
the
court
can
decide
under
146
of
chapter
x
as
to
the
adequacy
of
the
relief
afforded
by
chapter
xi.
they
can
decide
in
the
exercise
of
its
equity
powers
under
chapter
xi
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding
the
public
and
private
interest
involved
and
protecting
its
own
jurisdiction
from
misuse.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
that's
right.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
well,
they
--
yes,
that's
correct.we
contend
that
the
standards
set
for
jurisdiction
have
been
set
forth
very
clearly
and
concisely
under
the
realty
decision.
we
claim,
however,
that
no
hard
and
fast
form
has
been
made
into
which
they
have
to
fit.
that
is
discretionary
in
the
lower
court
after
hearing
all
of
the
facts
to
determine
whether
or
not,
within
the
patterns
set
forth
in
the
realty
case,
this
particular
case
is
discretionary.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
that's
right,
sir.
now,
with
respect,
however,
to
the
debtors
argument
that
the
amendment
in
1952
of
328
and
366,
the
--
the
house
report
specifically
states
to
what
was
intended
for
the
purpose
of
codifying
the
decision
in
the
realty
case.
and
it
does
exactly
that.
either
that
or
the
language
that's
used
is
merely
self
surplusage.
so
far
as
the
plan
itself
is
concerned,
we
would
certainly
have
been
guilty
of
--
if
the
contention
of
the
appellees
here
that
we
are
bound
to
look
solely
at
the
plan.
and
that
the
factors
determine
the
size
and
the
other
standards
do
not
apply
were
it
to
apply
here,
we'd
be
guilty
of
latches
if
we
attempted
to
proceed
in
xi
for
this
reason.
under
chapter
xi,
the
congress,
in
its
wisdom,
has
decided
that
a
plan
of
arrangement
must
be
filed
with
the
petition.
well,
we
have
found
very
often
with
debtor
in
filing
the
petition
has
got
the
marshal
or
sheriff
right
behind
them
and
he
rushes
down
the
court
just
fast
enough.
so
that
the
plan
may
be
modified.
and
we
have
modified
plans
of
arrangement,
the
second
modified
plan,
and
we
have
one
in
this
particular
case.
you
have
a
modified
plan.
and
then
maybe
a
second
and
a
third
plan.
so
that
we
would
never
have
an
opportunity
to
come
in.
we
feel,
sir,
that
the
standards
have
been
set
by
the
court
in
the
realty
case.
that
they
have
been
codified
by
the
court,
by
the
amendments
through
328
and
366.
that
to
state
that
the
court
based
it
solely
on
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
prevents
a
misreading,
in
my
judgment,
of
the
provisions
of
the
realty
case.
and
under
the
circumstances,
in
view
of
the
fact
--
the
facts
seem
to
be
and
all
aligns
with
the
realty
case,
we
ask
that
the
decisions
below
be
affirmed.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
right,
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
that's
right.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
and
in
addition
to
that,
of
course,
you
would
have
had
the
expiration
statutes
of
limitation.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
of
course,
it
was
the
decision.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
mr.
justice
black,
we
don't
go
as
far
as
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
if
the
intention
of
the
s.e.c.
is
to
state
that
if
there
are
any
securities
publicly
held,
if
that
is
their
position
that
any
securities,
we
say
no.
we
say
this
court
was
correct
in
the
transvision
case.
that
you
must
apply
that
as
one
of
the
standards
that
must
be
applied.
i
say
it
is
not
conclusive
that
merely
because
there
was
$10,000
or
$50,000
or
$100,000
in
securities
in
the
hands
of
the
public,
that
in
my
humble
judgment
is
not
sufficient.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
but
i
say
that,
sir,
together
with
the
other
aspects,
spells
out
a
case
with
chapter
x.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
well,
there
would
be
more
than
discretionary
power
on
the
part
--
mr.
a.
alan
reich
--
the
court
would
be
mandated
to
a
point
in
the
sense
that
--
mr.
a.
alan
reich
that's
right.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
the
court
--
mr.
a.
alan
reich
no.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
no.
judge
dimock
--
judge
dimock
in
his
opinion
found
--
excuse
me.
that
--
this
question
--
counsel,
may
i
finish
--
mr.
a.
alan
reich
no.
judge
dimock
in
his
opinion
based
on
the
papers
and
based
on
the
law,
the
grant
that
we
made
the
original
application,
sir.
and
the
s.e.c.
moved
to
intervene
and
also
holds
for
answer,
a
similar
petition
to
dismiss
and
the
motion
of
the
s.e.c.
was
granted.
i
would
understand
that
judge
dimock
exercised
the
--
the
discretion
in
determining
that
we
come
within
the
confines
of
the
realty
case
and
have
presented
sufficient
facts
which
shows
that
the
matter
is
properly
in
chapter
x
with
its
investigatory
powers
rather
than
under
chapter
xi.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
and
--
mr.
a.
alan
reich
i
think
it
could
well
be.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
circuit
court,
sir,
in
the
part
of
the
opinion
of
judge
clark
that
i
read
from,
indicated
very
clearly
that
the
creditors
may
well
regret
this
extension.
apparently,
the
creditors
committee
regretted
it
before
the
conclusion
and
made
a
new
deal.
mr.
a.
alan
reich
thank
you,
sir.
