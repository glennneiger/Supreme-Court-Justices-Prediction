mr.
max
goldweber
if
the
court
please.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
wage
claimants
who
formally
employed
by
the
petitioner
in
support
of
the
petitioner's
brief
before
this
court
in
seeking
the
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
are
174
wage
claimants
here
with
claims
approximating
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars.
there
are
also
priorities
totalling
some
approximate
$90,000.
now,
pursuant
to
chapter
xi
section
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
these
claimants
are
entitled
to
a
priority
which
amounts
to
this
$90,000.
now,
under
the
order
and
the
judgment
appealed
from,
these
wage
claimants
are
completely
deprived
of
this
priority
if
the
order
below
and
the
judgment
below
are
left
to
stand.
because
under
the
provisions
of
chapter
x,
section
102
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
it
is
specifically
provided
that
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act
shall
not
be
applicable
to
proceedings
under
chapter
x.
now,
the
order
of
the
district
court
is
self-executing
in
that
either
the
petitioner
change
or
amend
its
petition
to
chapter
x
or
it
be
dismissed.
and
were
to
be
dismissed,
we
would
automatically
lose
this
priority.
now,
the
wage
earners
therefore,
would
be
left
at
the
mercy
either
of
the
debtor
where
he
--
were
it
to
amend
to
chapter
x
or
at
the
mercy
of
the
general
unsecured
creditors
were
they
to
file
an
involuntary
petition
for
bankruptcy.
now,
the
rights
of
these
wage
earners
can
only
be
protected
by
a
continuation
of
the
chapter
xi
proceedings
or
by
an
adjudication
of
the
debtor
under
the
direction
of
said
proceedings
be
continued
as
a
straight
bankruptcy.
now,
i
need
not
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
wage
earners
have
been
under
the
special
protection
of
congress
and
the
courts
and
there
are
many,
many
cases
have
been
cited
in
our
brief
in
conformity
with
this.
mr.
max
goldweber
three
months.
mr.
max
goldweber
that's
correct.
for
or
up
to
$600
maximum.
and
this
is
a
claim
for
severance
pay
under
a
contract
between
the
six
operating
unions
which
i
represented
and
the
debtor.
mr.
max
goldweber
oh,
no.
no,
no.
mr.
max
goldweber
only
for
the
three
months
as
to
the
priority.
those
sums
over
and
above
$600
are
general
--
are
general
creditors.
mr.
max
goldweber
well,
yes.
the
general
unsecured
creditors
would
make
no
difference
as
to
the
priorities.
mr.
max
goldweber
under
xi
section
64
(a)
gives
them
a
priority,
to
give
up
to
$600.
now,
of
the
quarter
million
dollars
only
$90,000
represents
a
priority
approximately
$155,000
represents
general
unsecured
creditors.
we
would
come
in
under
both
phases
of
this.
however,
it
is
our
contention
that
we
do
not
want
to
lose
this
very
real
advantage
we
have
of
having
a
priority
because
all
of
these
wage
earners
no
longer
work
for
the
petitioner.
many
of
them
have
worked
as
long
as
30
years,
have
spent
their
lifetime
on
this
particular
job.
many
of
them
are
not
employable
elsewhere
and
this
small
sum
of
money
represents
to
many
the
savings
that
they
may
have
accumulated
over
30
years
of
employment
with
the
petitioner.
now,
it
is
apparent
that
the
provisions
granting
these
priorities
to
wage
earners
are
the
result
of
considerations
of
social
policy
by
the
congress
and
has
been
enunciated
in
several
of
the
cases.
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
court
should
give
special
consideration
to
the
congressional
policies
intended
by
this
statutory
enactment.
now,
we
must
consider
the
impact
of
the
order
and
judgment
appealed
from
below.
we
have
174
families
affected
directly
and
adversely.
some
of
these
claims
total,
some
odd
$2000.
some
$1500.
these
people
have
not
received
that
money
since
the
debtor
has
filed
its
petition
on
october
18th,
1954,
some
15
or
16
months
ago.
now,
if
the
petition
is
amended
to
a
chapter
xi,
it
is
without
question
established
from
experience
that
a
chapter
x
proceeding
would
take
a
considerable
time
in
the
appointment
of
a
trustee,
his
attorney
in
going
on
to
examine
all
the
books.
we
might
then
have
a
situation
where
this
would
continue
for
an
even
greater
period
of
time
that
we
have
had
today.
and
it
is
our
contention
therefore,
that
since
no
other
creditor
seeks
the
reversal
or
rather
seeks
the
change
from
xi
to
x
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
should
be
permitted
to
stay
in
chapter
xi.
thank
you.
