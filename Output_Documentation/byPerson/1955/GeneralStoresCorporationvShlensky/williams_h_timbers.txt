mr.
williams
h.
timbers
may
it
please
the
court.
position
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
here
very
simply
but
fundamentally,
that
the
issue
before
this
court
as
to
whether
chapter
x
or
chapter
xi
of
the
bankruptcy
act
affords
the
--
an
adequate
remedy
for
the
rehabilitation
of
this
debtor,
is
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
statutory
language
plus
the
fundamental
principles
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
realty
case
which,
as
we
understand
and
still
in
controls.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
so
of
course
--
excuse
me.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
correct.
but,
of
course,
with
reference
to
the
phrase
adequate
remedy,
your
honor,
is
what
i
referred
to.
this
court
did
give,
i
think
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
--
a
considerable
meaning
to
that
phrase
and
that
decision
and
we
believe
that
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i
think
your
observation
is
--
your
honor's
observation
is
quite
correct.
now,
as
undoubtedly,
the
court
has
become
aware
in
view
of
the
arguments
by
the
three
counsels
for
the
petitioner's
side
of
the
case
seeking
to
reverse
the
courts
below,
their
position
in
substance
is
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
realty
case
or
if
the
court
doesn't
agree
with
them
on
that,
the
realty
case
has
been
overruled
or
drastically
limited
by
the
1952
amendments
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
on
our
side
of
the
case,
that
is
on
the
respondent
side,
we
both
agree
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
the
commission,
on
the
grounds
that
i
have
just
stated,
the
right
representing
mr.
shlensky,
supports
us
except
that
he
would
put
it
on
the
basis
of
the
appropriate
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
court.
we
shall
have
a
word
to
say
on
that
in
a
moment.
now,
if
i
may
first
answer
or
try
to
answer
justice
black's
question
while
it
is
still
fresh
in
mind
what
to,
have
asked
counsel,
spoke
to
whether
there
are
any
stockholders
or
any
stockholder
interest
as
it
has
expressed
itself
either
against
the
plan
or
in
favor
of
the
plan
other
than
mr.
shlensky,
may
i
respectfully
point
out
that
under
chapter
xi,
by
virtue
of
its
very
terms
and
in
view
of
its
basic
function,
stockholders
have
no
opportunity
to
be
heard,
to
be
notified,
and
brought
that
may
appear
in
the
record,
know
nothing
about
these
proceedings.
it
is
true
that
judge
clark
in
the
majority
opinion
in
the
court
below
made
this
statement
and
i
assume,
let's
say,
finding
was
supported
by
the
record
that
--
that
the
stockholder
seemed
to
be
generally
opposed
to
this
plan
and
were
worried
as
to
the
ultimate
outcome
of
their
equity
and
interest.
now,
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
the
court,
i
know
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
other
than
mr.
shlensky's
petition
in
the
position
that
he
has
taken
in
this
court,
or
has
taken
in
the
court
below.
but
that
was
a
consideration
in
any
event
taken
into
account
by
the
court
below.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i
think
that
is
probably
so,
your
honor.
and
if
i'm
not
incorrect,
the
courts
have
held
that
once
a
stockholder
like
this
brings
such
a
suit
know
not
tasked
in
the
usual
representative
capacity
form
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
discontinue
with
or
withdraw
it.
it
could
not
be
brought
off
on
the
theory
that
he
does
represent
the
stockholders
as
a
class.
so,
i
think
your
honor
is
quite
correct.
now,
the
petitioner's
argument
to
this
court,
with
respect
to
the
realty
case,
breaks
down
in
two
ways.
first,
that
it's
not
applicable
because
the
facts
differ.
sure,
it
differs,
we
don't
have
two
identical
cases
but
the
controlling
principles
are
the
same
because
of
this
fundamental
fact
that,
i
submit,
we
simply
cannot
get
away
from.
that
is,
that
this
debtor
general
stores
like
u.s.
realty,
has
a
substantial
public
investor
interest
which
needs
protection,
cannot
get
it
under
chapter
xi
but
only
under
chapter
x.
and
therefore,
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
adequate
remedy
that
is
required
is
available
only
under
chapter
x
and
not
under
chapter
xi.
have
in
mind
here,
we
have
7000
public
stockholders.
that
happens
to
be
the
same
number
that
we
had
in
the
u.s.
realty
case.
the
stock
is
actively
traded
on
the
american
stock
exchange
which
is,
in
and
of
itself,
is
an
indicium
of
a
substantial
public
interest.
furthermore,
it
is
a
company
that
has
had
a
checkered
financial
history,
using
the
words
of
the
court
below.
it
had
its
ups
and
down
and
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
now
has
invoked
the
rehabilitation
powers
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
that
alone
indicates
that
there
has
been
a
sufficient
deterioration
in
its
position,
financial
position
to
be
of
concern
and
deep
concern
to
the
public
security
holders.
now,
the
court
may
very
well
inquire
but
we
don't
regard
their
regarded
difference
and
observe
a
difference
between
the
character
of
the
public
investor
interest
in
the
realty
case
as
distinguished
from
this
case.
i
think
that
was
implicit
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
earlier.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
character
of
that
interest
because
in
the
realty
case,
there
were
public
debenture
holders,
public
creditors.
but
that
was
not
the
controlling
fact
nor
the
decisive
factor
upon
which
this
court
decided
the
realty
case.
this
court
was
most
articulate
in
spelling
out
and
we
don't
propose
to
re-plead
or
ask
this
court
even
to
reconsider
those
factors,
which
in
the
aggregate
constitute
this
public
investor
interest.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i
think
this
should
be
said,
your
honor.
and
incidentally,
i
think
the
--
perhaps
the
accurate
or
true
meaning
of
the
realty
decision
provide
our
differences
here
may
be
pointed
up
by
justice
robert's
dissent
where
he
very
sharply
criticized
the
majority
of
this
court
for
setting
up
a
criteria
whereby
large
corporations
could
not
go
into
chapter
xi
actually
resort
to
chapter
x.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
and
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
realty.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i
think
that
is,
perhaps,
the
most
important
single
criterion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
would
say
this.
that
where
you've
got
a
large
corporation,
large
public
corporation,
by
that,
i
assume,
you
mean
with
a
large
number
of
public
security
holders
that
in
90
--
95%
of
the
cases,
chapter
xi
does
not
afford
an
adequate
remedy.
i
--
we
can
conceive
of
cases
where
there
might
be
a
--
a
large
number
of
public
security
holders
where
the
question
would
be
a
little
closer.
for
example,
if
all
of
the
stock
were
underwater
and
there
was
no
present
equity
in
favor
of
the
stockholders
and
you
had
only
stockholders,
you
certainly
would
have
to
reexamine
a
little
bit
more
carefully
to
see
whether
the
substantial
public
investor
interest
there
justified
resort
to
chapter
x.
i
would
submit
that
even
there,
it
would
be
important
to
look
at
the
financial
history
of
the
company
and
to
determine
whether
the
--
there
was
a
fair
prospect
that
the
stockholders
though,
having
no
present
equity,
might
as
a
result
of
the
thorough
reorganization
possible
under
chapter
x,
might
very
well
come
out
with
some
interest.
as
indeed,
has
been
done
in
numerous
cases.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
yes,
sir.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i
would
like
to
answer
your
question,
justice,
specifically
and
directly
as
i
can,
your
honor.
did
i
correctly
understand
you'd
assumed
the
same
facts
of
this
case
insofar
as
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
no,
i
mean
insofar
as
the
size
and
number
of
stockholders
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i'd
like
to
answer
this
way,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
black.
my
short
answer
is
yes.
but
i
think
that
your
--
the
court
is
entitled
to
an
explanation.
and
i
think
the
explanation
should
be
very
clearly
this.
that
it
would
be
impossible
in
a
chapter
xi
proceeding
to
make
the
finding
or
determination
that
your
honor's
question
supposes.
namely,
excessive
cost,
perhaps,
standard
delay
in
time
in
chapter
x.
for
this
reason
that
you
can't
have
a
plan,
you
can't
determine
the
extent
of
--
of
time,
money
to
be
expended
nor
the
adequacy
of
the
relief
needed
under
chapter
x
until
after
the
petition's
been
filed,
approved,
trustee
appointed
and
the
machinery
put
into
operation
to
bring
the
plan
into
effect.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
well,
there
are
no
facts
in
this
record
that
i
know
of.
and
the
counsel
will
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
as
to
any
comparative
cost
or
expenses
in
--
as
between
chapters
xi
and
x.
and
i
should
say,
your
honor,
because
it
is
one
of
those
(inaudible)
around
rather
loosely
and
we
find
it
in
the
briefs
here
repeated
over
and
over
again.
that
one
of
the
big
troubles
that
chapter
x
is
it's
expensive,
cumbersome,
time
consuming,
and
--
and
surely
as
they
say
will
result
in
the
dissipation
--
further
dissipation
of
the
assets
of
the
company.
that
is
not
necessarily
so.
and
it
has
been
the
experience
of
this
commission
under
our
--
in
our
functions
under
chapter
x
for
some
16
years
now.
i
guess
it
is
15
or
16
years
now,
i
guess
it
is,
15
or
16
years,
that
reorganizations
can
be
had
under
chapter
x
relatively
quickly
in
as
short
a
space
of
time
as
six
months.
they
are
not
necessarily
expensive.
and
in
any
--
in
any
event
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
no
such
finding
can
possibly
be
made
nor
was
made
here
and
the
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
yes.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
certainly
true
in
--
under
chapter
x
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
it
is
also
true
under
chapter
xi.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
true.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
true.
now
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
no,
we
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
is
not
the
controlling
determination
and
even
if
it
were
so.
and
may
i
say
parenthetically
that
--
that
the
supposition,
your
honor,
mentioned
right
at
the
beginning
that
the
creditors
would
be
paid
in
full,
is
all
that
this
record
shows
so
far
as
the
terms
of
the
plan
concerns.
we'll
see
the
plan
it
set
forth
two
pages
of
the
record
and
it
provides
for
100%
payment
of
the
unsecured
creditors,
20%
down
and
20%
over
a
period
of
four
years.
now,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
in
one
of
their
briefs,
the
creditors
committee
brief
that
that
plan
has
been
amended
and
it's
now,
that
they
are
only
going
to
get
40%.
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
record
to
support
that.
but
the
controlling
consideration,
your
honor,
is
not
whether
the
secured
creditors
--
the
unsecured
creditors
are
going
to
be
paid
in
full.
the
controlling
consideration,
i
submit,
depict
me
in
the
light
of
--
the
length
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
realty
case
is
whether
all
public
and
private
interests
will
be
protected.
and
you
may
very
well
have
a
situation
in
this
case
or
in
any
comparable
case
where
the
secured
creditors
may
fair
very
well.
and
still
greatly
jeopardize
the
interests
of
other
facets
of
security
(voice
overlap)
--
including
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i
think
that's
the
basis
of
realty.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
the
--
the
short
answer,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it's
a
conclusive
answer
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
that
determination
in
this
type
of
proceeding.
that
is
a
proceeding
where
petition
has
been
filed
in
chapter
xi.
it
cannot
make
the
comparison
between
the
adequacy
of
the
relief
that
chapters
x
and
xi,
on
the
basis
of
a
chapter
xi
petition
which
you'll
see
in
the
record,
is
a
very
short
simple
thing
with
the
plan
of
arrangement
attached.
it's
impossible
to
determine
the
adequacy
of
the
relief
proposed
under
that
type
of
plan
where
you
got
public
security
holders
without
employing
the
machinery
of
chapter
x.
now,
that
is
our
basic
position.
it's
nothing
new.
it's
simply
a
reassertion
of
the
position
of
this
court
in
the
realty
case.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
now,
this
is
the
best
of
my
ability,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
well,
with
the
caveat
that
i
necessarily
will
--
will
paint
it
in
broad
brush
strokes
and
the
--
the
risk
of
leaving
out
a
good
deal.
i
think
the
essentials
are
these.
under
chapter
xi,
petition's
been
filed.
normally,
creditors
are
given
notice.
their
acceptances
are
filed.
they
can
be
solicited
even
before
the
plan
is
submitted
to
the
court.
after
a
hearing
by
the
court,
the
plan,
if
found
to
be
feasible
and
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors,
would
be
confirmed.
thereafter,
distribution
will
be
made
and
consummated.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
yes.
that
i
think
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
it's
in
effect
a
projection
of
the
old
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
equity
--
the
common
law
of
composition
which
was
codified
in
section
12
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
it's
a
simple
procedure,
no
question
about
it.
however,
the
judge
in
acting
upon
it
is
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
none,
whatsoever.
he
has
no
standing
whatsoever
in
the
court,
in
the
chapter
xi
court.
i
don't
suppose
it
would
be
heard
of
the
court.
he's
only
--
only
right
is
to
intervene
the
purpose
of
dismissing
or
transferring
to
chapter
x
which
he
did
here
supported
by
information.
one
of
the
most
important
things,
may
i
mention
in
passing,
in
respect
to
this
streamline
arrangement
procedure
under
chapter
xi
is
that
the
court,
in
making
its
determination
of
whether
it's
feasible,
whether
it's
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors,
makes
a
determination
necessarily
base
on
relatively,
poorly
informed
judgment.
if
he
has
a
judgment
not
supported
by
the
facts
or
anything
like
the
facts
that
he
would
have
under
chapter
x.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
there
can
be
an
appraisal
if
necessary.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
if
it's
asked
for
the
judge
in
its
--
in
his
discretion
in
that.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that's
right
under
the
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
yes.
by
the
terms
of
the
arrangement
they
can
accept
less
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
--
that
is
possible.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
the
purpose
is
it
used
to
enable
the
debtor
by
this
simple,
in
effect,
the
composition
between
debtor
and
creditors
to
satisfy
or
scale
down
the
unsecured
debts
but
without
disturbing
either
the
stock
interest
or
the
security.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
and
that
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
no.
it
--
it
is
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
yes.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
right.
and,
of
course,
your
honor's
observation
is
quite
correct
that
upon
the
surface,
it
would
appear
that
and
in
this
type
of
arrangement
proposed
here
would
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
--
would
benefit
the
stockholders
because
they'll
get
more
than
if
they'd
put
--
than
if
the
creditors
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
those
are
considerations.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
the
--
the
real
question
here
is
whether
those
considerations
are
outweighed
by
the
--
the
larger
interests
of
public
policy
which
this
court
enunciated
in
the
realty
case
in
which
were
based
upon
the
legislative
history
and
the
language
of
chapter
x.
now,
those
larger
interests,
your
honor,
and
i'm
coming
back
to
answer
justice
frankfurter's
question,
i
shall
not
forget
it.
the
larger
interests
are
basically
to
--
to
determine
what
this
company
needs
in
order
to
obtained
the
adequate
relief
or
adequate
remedy
which
in
--
in
accordance
to
the
language
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
what
here
appears
to
be
good
for
the
stockholders
after
a
thorough
going
rehabilitation
procedure
under
chapter
x,
may
turn
out
to
be
completely
illusory.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
had
many
--
many
chapter
xi
arrangements
that
have
been
confirmed,
the
debtor
goes
out.
it's
a
first
aid
room,
patched
job.
they're
back
in
a
year
or
so
under
chapter
x.
then
the
stockholder's
equity
has
been
dissipated
and
the
net
result
is
extremely
prejudicial
to
the
stockholders.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
it's
been
a
--
there's
been
very
little
time
since
that
arrangement
was
confirmed.
we've
endeavored
to
have
been
to
it,
have
not
been
able
to
get
the
information.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
yes.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
our
position,
your
honor,
as
i
reinstated
in
our
little
supplemental
brief.
there
are
priority
claimants
same
as
tax
payments
and
despite
the
--
what
appears
to
be
the
language
of
chapter
x
that
takes
out
--
takes
out
from
under
them,
deprives
them
of
the
statutory
priority
in
section
64.
the
--
our
--
our
knowledge
is
based
on
some
experience.
there's
been
no
chapter
x
court
has
ever
deprived
the
wage
claimants
of
these
priorities
under
the
discretion
available
to
the
district
judge
strictly
under
the
six
months
rule
(inaudible)
the
rule
in
the
second
circuit,
prior
wage
claimants
have
universally
been
accorded
their
priority.
we
know
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i
think
it's
a
mater
of
discretion
and
so
far
as
we
know
it
has
been
exercised
uniformly
in
favor
of
the
wage
claimants.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
correct.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
yes,
there
is,
as
to
the
priority
claimants,
as
to
the
priority
wage
claimants.
may
we
say
this,
however,
with
respect
to
the
central
issue
before
this
court
which
i've
tried
to
state
and
i
hope
is
--
that's
fairly
clear.
we
do
not
consider
the
extent
or
nature
of
the
wage
claims
as
necessarily
controlling,
as
to
whether
this
case
should
be
in
chapter
x
or
chapter
xi.
adding
however
that
we
are
assured
that
the
wage
claimants
will
be
--
will
receive
just
as
favorable
treatment
under
chapter
x
as
under
chapter
xi.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that's
what
i
tried
to
say,
mr.
justice
douglas
that
is
the
all
equity
rules
sometime
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that's
right.
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
six
months
rule
which
it
uniformly
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
we
know
no
such
instance,
your
honor,
certainly
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
the
reason
for
that
is
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
the
--
the
reason
for
that
as
we
understand
it,
was
to
permit
the
--
give
to
the
chapter
x
court
greater
flexibility
with
respect
to
its
handling
of
a
number
of
different
types
of
claims,
one
of
which
was
the
wage
earners
claims.
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
although
that
priority
has
been
eliminated
under
chapter
x,
it
has
never
prejudiced
the
wage
earners
and
i
would
assume
if
--
if
it
had,
there
would
have
been
such
pressure
brought
on
congress
that
the
type
of
bill
your
honor
has
spoken,
having
introduced,
would
have
been
introduced.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
wage
claimants
might
very
well
get
more
under
chapter
x
than
they
would
under
chapter
xi.
and
incidentally,
their
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
they'd
be
entitled
to
--
to
go
back
six
months
instead
of
the
three
months
period
for
which
they're
claiming
priority.
in
other
words,
their
general
claim
--
the
claim
as
general
creditors
would
be
extended
to
--
to
establish
their
priority
for
a
period
of
six
months
rather
than
three
months.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
i
suppose
it's
the
usual
criteria
for
a
--
an
equity
judge
exercising
his
discretion.
and
certainly,
it
has
been
done
in
favor
of
wage
claimants
and
has
been
done
uniformly,
not
only
under
chapter
x
but
going
back
under
77
(b)
in
the
equity
receivership
cases
as
well.
i'd
like,
if
i
could,
in
--
in
a
very
short
compass
to
cover
one
point
that
i
don't
think
has
been
covered
at
all
in
this
point,
asked
by
justice
reed
as
to
what
--
why
the
amendments
to
the
bankruptcy
act
in
1952
and
their
effect
on
this
issue
before
this
case,
your
honor,
before
this
court.
very
briefly,
the
two
amendments
that
are
relevant
are
section
328
that
set
is
forth,
page
29
of
the
s.e.c.brief
that,
in
effect,
codified
the
procedural
rule
of
the
realty
case
which
gives
to
the
commission
statutory
authority
to
intervene
in
any
chapter
xi
proceeding,
to
move
to
dismiss
or
transfer.
i
think
there's
no
question.
i
think
we're
all
agreed
that
amendment
did
codify
that
procedural
rule
of
realty
case.
the
other
amendment
here
relevant
is
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
set
forth
at
page
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
49
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
i
understand.
now,
perhaps,
the
more
important
amendments
insofar
as
our
discussion
here
is
concerned,
is
section
366
which
eliminated
the
fair
and
equitable
requirement
of
chapter
xi
with
respect
to
arrangements.
now,
the
legislative
history
on
that
is
set
forth,
is
quoted
at
page
31
of
the
commission
brief.
we'll
not
read
it
because
of
the
shortage
of
time
but
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
i
--
that
legislative
history
at
page
29
of
our
--
page
31
of
our
brief,
should
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
other
--
the
history
of
the
other
amendment
at
page
29
of
our
brief.
29
and
31
of
the
s.e.c.brief.
the
net
effect
is
that
congress
said
and
most
articulately,
i
suggest,
page
31
of
our
brief,
that
in
eliminating
the
fair
and
equitable
requirement
of
chapter
xi
arrangements,
they
were
writing
into
the
statute,
the
substantive
law
of
this
court
in
the
realty
case,
namely,
that
a
chapter
xi
arrangement
was
intended
only
for
the
small
corporation
where
there
was
a
close
identity
of
management
and
stockholder
interest.
judge
clark
so
stated
in
his
opinion
in
the
second
circuit,
the
words
that
congress
wrote
in
to
the
law,
the
rule
of
this
court
in
that
case
are
judge
--
judge
clark's
words.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
--
now
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
of
course,
we're
confronted
with
what
congress
did,
your
honor.
we
--
and
we
have
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
--
as
best
we
can
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
well,
the
argument
--
the
argument,
your
honor,
is
--
is
very
closely
tied
to
the
words
--
only
words
that
congress
wrote
in
explaining
what
it
did
and
in
taking
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
committee
of
the
house.
the
--
the
elimination
of
chapter
--
of
the
fair
and
equitable
requirement
of
chapter
xi
in
a
nutshell
simply
recognized
congressional
acceptance
of
the
fact
this
court
had
established
in
the
realty
case
that
chapter
xi
was
inappropriate
for
the
large
corporation
with
a
substantial
public
investor
interest.
and
in
saying
as
they
did
in
the
committee
report
that
in
the
light
of
the
boyd
and
the
(inaudible)
cases,
the
absolute
priority
rule
cases
of
this
court
it
would
never
be
possible
to
have
an
arrangement
under
chapter
xi.
and
therefore,
they
eliminated
those
--
that
requirement
and
expressly
stated
that
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
squaring
the
law
--
squaring
the
statute
for
the
decision
of
law
of
this
court
to
limit
that
--
the
use
of
that
chapter
to
the
small
corporation
with
close
identity
between
management
and
stockholder
interest.
mr.
williams
h.

--
mr.
williams
h.

page
31
i
think
is
the
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
under
chapter
x,
the
procedure
if
i
may
say
is
simply
by
way
of
summation
is
considerably
more
detailed
representing
a
more
thorough,
complete
rehabilitation
than
under
chapter
xi.
i
regret
that
time
simply
does
not
permit
to
step
by
step,
recounting
what
happens,
but
may
i
say
so
far
as
issues
in
this
case
are
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
the
most
important
things
they're
available
under
chapter
xi
to
protect
this
substantial
public
investor
interest
which
we
undoubtedly
have
here.
and
that
i
don't
think
it
can
be
disputed.
but
first,
the
appointment
of
an
independent
trustee
who
will
supervise
the
formulation
of
a
plan
and
will
determine,
not
in
the
best
interest
of
management,
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
secured
creditors
but
taking
into
account
all
of
the
public
and
private
interests,
what
is
necessary
to
bring
about
an
appropriate
rehabilitation
of
this
in
the
corporation.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
that
is
our
fundamental
position.
may
i
say,
however,
your
honor,
that
it's
not
quite
that
simple
and
the
concept
that
i
would
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
adopt
and
lay
down
for
the
guidance
of
the
lower
courts
is
when
there
is
bound
to
be
a
substantial
public
investor
interest,
one
of
the
indicia
which
may
be
the
size
of
the
company,
assets,
liabilities,
the
number
of
stockholders,
the
character
of
the
debt-structured
financial
history.
they
are
all
facets
of
the
entire
overall
problem.
now,
this
court
is
undoubtedly
aware
of
the
other
cases
that
are
--
are
pending,
not
only
the
possible
conflict
in
the
second
circuit
between
transition
in
this
case,
this
same
issue
is
in
the
wilcox
case
in
the
sixth
circuit.
there
is
a
lower
district
court
decision
which
incidentally
as
a
very
enlightening
decision,
printed
as
appendix
b
to
the
s.e.c.
brief
came
down
since
our
petition
here.
you
have,
if
i
may
say
just
in
conclusion,
a
situation
where
such
confusion
has
arisen
amongst
the
district
courts
and
indeed
amongst
the
courts
of
appeals.
that
we
submit
that
the
(inaudible)
graphical
map,
the
bankruptcy
act
has
implemented
by
the
excellent
trail
blaze
by
the
realty
case
now
needs
a
replacing
with
respect
to
the
relatively
narrow
issue
presented
to
this
court
which
we
submit
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
reaffirmation
of
the
rule
of
the
realty
case.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
the
short
of
it
is
that
we
--
we
would
not
suggest
for
a
moment
that
this
court
sanction
a
--
a
rule
of
numbers
and
numbers
gained
by
the
district
court.
numbers
may
be
important.
certainly
when
there
is
as
many
as
7000
as
in
this
case
that
is
almost
controlling
without
any
other
further
considerations.
but
we
also
can
conceive
of
the
situation
where
a
hundred
stockholders
might
represent
a
substantial
public
investor
interest.
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
oh,
yes.
here,
there
is
--
their
plan
provides
for
a
complete
satisfaction,
complete
discharge
of
the
unsecured
claims
for
40%
of
the
--
at
--
at
the
rate
of
40%.
they
say
now
--
mr.
williams
h.
timbers
well,
the
plan
is
set
forth
attached
to
the
petition,
your
honor,
provided
for
payment
of
100%
of
the
unsecured
claims
over
a
period
of
five
years.
so,
that
would
be
in
effect
a
--
an
extension
arrangement.
now,
they
tell
us
in
their
brief
and
i'm
not
taking
actions
to
deal
outside
of
the
record
that
they,
in
view
of
new
cash
reserves
that
have
come
in,
plan
has
been
amended
or
going
to
be
amended
to
provide
for
a
40%
acceptance
by
all
unsecured
trade
creditors
and
accepted
now.
so,
i
take
it
that
would
not
be
an
extension
of
time
arrangement.
thank
you.
