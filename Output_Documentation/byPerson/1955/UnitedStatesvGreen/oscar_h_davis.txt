mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
illinois
under
the
criminal
appeal
act.
under
that
section
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
which
provides
for
a
direct
review
here
of
a
decision
of
a
district
court
arresting
and
judgment
of
conviction
for
insufficiency
of
indictment,
where
the
decision
of
the
district
court
rest
upon
the
construction
for
the
validity
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
indictment
is
found.
the
statute,
upon
which
the
indictment
in
this
case
has
found
it,
is
the
hobbs
act
which
was
passed
by
congress
in
july
1946.
and
in
general
it
prohibits
and
punishes
extortion
and
robbery
affecting
interstate
commerce,
accomplished
by
force
and
violence
and
wrongfully
induced
fear.
the
facts
of
the
case
on
the
record
which
is
before
this
court
are
not
complicated.
an
indictment
was
brought
forth
by
the
grand
jury
in
nine
counts
against
two
appellees,
jack
green
and
local
397
of
labor's
union.
we
are
concerned
here
with
only
the
first
two
of
those
accounts
because
the
district
attorney
elected
to
go
forward
only
on
four
counts
and
the
jury
acquitted
on
two
counts.
now,
the
counts
upon
which
we
are
--
with
which
we're
concerned
her
are
accounts
one
and
two
appearing
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
record,
pages
one
and
two.
and
what
they
charge
is,
that
these
two
defendants
violated
the
hobbs
act
by
attempting
to
extort
and
by
force
and
violence
attempted
an
actual
force
and
violence
and
fear.
attempted
to
extort
from
government
contractors
engaged
in
work
affecting
interstate
commerce,
property
of
these
government
contractors
in
the
form
of
wages
for
imposed,
fictitious,
superfluous
and
unnecessary
labor
--
labor
of
person's
called
“swampers”,
common
laborers
called
“swampers”
who
were
--
according
to
the
indictment
to
be
employed
in
connection
with
equipment
being
operated
by
the
contractors
on
these
government
projects.
swampers,
i
understand,
are
supernumeraries,
common
laborers
who
are
sometimes
employed
in
connection
with
heavy
equipment,
most
generally
for
going
ahead
of
the
equipment
to
tell
the
operator
of
the
equipment
whether
there
are
holes
which
he
ought
to
avoid,
and
also,
to
take
out
branches,
twigs
and
other
obstacles
which
are
on
his
way.
now
the
--
as
i
have
said,
there
was
an
actual
trial
on
this
case
that
lasted
for
about
10
days.
the
district
attorney
elected
to
go
forward
only
on
four
charges,
counts
of
the
indictment,
the
jury
convicted
only
on
the
first
two.
after
the
conviction,
the
defendants
made
a
motion
for
an
arrest
of
judgment.
they
also
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
a
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
now,
the
motion
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal
was
denied
by
the
district
judge
and
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
denied
by
the
district
judge.
and
the
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment
was
granted
on
two
grounds
only
and
the
first
ground
was
that
the
hobbs
act
did
not
cover
the
--
a
crime
which
was
charged
in
the
indictment.
and
the
second
ground
was
that
if
it
did,
if
the
hobbs
act
did
cover
that
--
that
type
of
crime,
then
the
statute
was
--
would
probably
be
unconstitutional.
and
i
stressed,
that
the
district
judge
denied
the
motion
in
respect
to
other
grounds
which
the
appellees
had
raised
below
and
he
also
denied
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
and
for
new
trial.
and
so,
the
cases
here
under
the
criminal
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr
justice
harlan,
we
don't
think
there
is
any
ambiguity
and
we
think
that
issue
was
--
hasn't
resolved
already
in
this
court.
because
at
the
very
beginning
when
the
government
filed
this
notice
to
appeal
and
jurisdictional
statement,
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
made
which
the
court
denied
implicitly
by
noting
probable
jurisdiction,
and
the
court
did
not
ask
for
discussion
of
its
jurisdiction
further.
and
so,
of
course
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
the
court
did
not
ask
for
further
discussion.
we
have
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
unless
the
court
desires
it.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'd
be
glad
to
discuss
it,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
--
the
district
judge
said
that
he
wanted
--
that
he
came
to
the
conclusion.
he
--
on
page
15
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
judge,
mr.
justice
black,
the
third
full
paragraph,
the
district
judge
says,
"when
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
was
made
in
the
beginning,
the
defendant's
didn't
argue
very
strongly
that
the
statute
didn't
cover
this
particular
crime
or
the
allegations
of
the
indictment."
so,
he
didn't
consider
it
very
fully.
so,
now
after
the
trial
they
renew
that
contention
and
he
has
looked
at
the
indictment
and
he
has
looked
at
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history,
and
he
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
make
what
the
indictment
charges
a
crime.
now,
those
--
that
we
think
is
pretty
clear
indication
that
what
he
was
doing
was
looking
only
at
the
allegations
of
the
indictment.
for
your
information,
mr.
justice
black,
the
government
has
in
its
statement
as
to
jurisdiction
and
particularly
in
its
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
to
dismiss
discussed
that
--
that
issue
much
more
fully.
and
also,
in
a
memorandum
which
is
filed
in
opposition
to
the
cross
designation
by
the
appellees,
the
appellees
designated
the
entire
trial
record
and
the
government
moved
to
strike
that
designation.
in
that
connection,
we
filed
this
mimeographed
document
which
also
contains
our
answer
to
the
--
to
the
statement
that
the
district
judge
did
more
than
merely
construe
the
statute,
which
is
what
the
criminal
appeals
act
deals
with
and
so
far
as
direct
appeal
is
concerned,
and
that
he
construed
the
indictment
or
that
he
rested
upon
the
evidence
which
was
before
him.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
just
don't
know
if
i
have
much
more
to
add
to
the
--
to
the
statement
that
we
have
made
in
the
--
in
these
documents
to
which
i
have
referred
the
court.
we
think
it
appears
pretty
clearly
that
all
he
did
is
to
say
the
hobbs
act
doesn't
cover
this
situation,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right
mr.
justice.
under
the
--
under
the
cases
which
this
court
has
decided
on
the
criminal
appeals
act,
i
think,
that's
very
clear
that
if
the
district
judge
construes
the
indictment
says,
“that
i
find
that
the
indictment
does
not
allege
requirement
of
the
statute,”
that
is
conclusive
on
this
court
because
the
court
is
bound
by
the
construction
of
the
indictment
by
the
district
court.
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
what
has
been
held
in
--
in
many
of
these
cases.
as
i
say,
we
have
not
briefed
it.
i
would
be
very
pleased
if
any
member
of
the
court
would
desire
further
brief
on
this
point
to
--
to
supply
one.
but
we
have
not
briefed
it
because
we
thought
that
the
issue
was
resolved
in
this
court
by
the
--
in
this
very
case,
by
the
denial
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
by
the
granting
of
the
government's
motion
to
strike
the
cross
designation
by
the
appellees
of
the
record.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
facts
in
--
in
the
evidence
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
mr.
justice?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
we
don't
think
they
are.
we
think
that
all
that's
pertinent
is
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
which
are
that
these
two
defendants
by
force
and
violence,
actual
or
threatened
compelled
these
two
government
contractors
to
employ
these
labors.
now,
of
course,
the
case
will
go
back
if
the
court
should
uphold
out
position
here
to
the
district
court
and
then
if
the
appellees
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
force
and
violence
in
the
case.
but
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
i
did,
i
misspoke
myself,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
meant
he
looked
at
the
indictment
and
the
--
and
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
i
did,
i
misspoke
myself.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
meant
he
looked
at
the
indictment
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
the
statute
and
came
to
a
conclusion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
--
i
--
i
would
fairly
be
out
of
court
because
this
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
to
review
that
kind
of
decision.
but
the
issue
then
as
we
see
it
in
this
court
is
the
very
limited
one.
and
that
is
whether
the
hobbs
act
covers
a
--
an
indictment
which
alleges
in
nontechnical
terms
that
the
defendants
by
force
and
violence
compelled
persons
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
to
employ
unnecessary
and
unwanted
employees,
in
colloquial
terms
"featherbedding."
but
featherbedding
with
this
crucial
difference,
featherbedding
compelled
by
force
and
violence
not
featherbedding
alone.
not
featherbedding
compelled
by
a
lawful
activity
such
as
picketing
or
collective
bargaining
negotiations
or
--
or
possibly
even
a
strike
because
what
we
have
in
this
case
on
this
indictment
is
featherbedding
compelled
by
actual
or
threatened
force
and
violence.
and
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
statute
covers
that
type
of
activity.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
indictment
possibly
could
be
construed
that
way
but
the
district
judge
did
not
so
construe
it.
he
construed
it
to
mean
that
--
that
it
--
the
services
would
be
rendered
if
the
--
if
the
employer
would
take
them.
and
we
think,
as
i
quote,
“we're
bound
in
this
court
by
the
construction
of
the
indictment.”
so,
on
that
issue
we
don't
argue
that
they
were
fictitious
in
--
in
this
court
on
this
appeal.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
would
say
he
did
it
in
an
abstract
way,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
he
--
he
read
the
indictment
and
he
decided
that
because
it
was
imposed,
unwanted,
superfluous
and
that
those
were
the
dominant
characteristics
in
--
in
this
case,
as
far
as
we
can
tell
from
reading
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
district
court.
the
government
thinks
that
its
position
that
the
hobbs
act
does
cover
this
crime
is
supported
both
by
the
words
of
the
statute
and
overwhelmingly
by
the
legislative
history.
and
the
short
answer,
we
think,
is
applied
first
by
the
--
by
the
statute,
which
appears
on
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief.
if
you
just
read
the
words
of
the
statute
and
compare
them
with
the
words
of
the
indictment,
we
would
think
that
--
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
indictment
which
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
the
statute
begins
by
saying
whoever
--
whoever
abstracts,
delays,
and
so
forth
and
the
word
"whoever"
is
a
very
broad
word
showing
that
the
reach
which
congress
intended
for
this
kind
of
statute.
and
particularly,
it
can
cover
a
labor
union.
it
can
cover
a
labor
union
official
or
business
agent
of
the
union.
and
the
second
element
is
whoever
in
anyway
or
degree
--
in
anyway
or
degree
and
that
too
shows
the
reach
of
the
statute.
and
the
third
element
in
this
case
is
extortion
or
i
should
say
first
that
the
third
element
is
interstate
commerce.
we
don't
have
that
issue
in
this
case
because
the
district
judge
decided
that
in
favor
of
the
government
on
the
basis
of
the
indictment
and
therefore
that
issue
is
not
open
here.
but
the
crucial
element
is
the
element
of
extortion.
an
extortion
is
defined
in
the
statute
on
the
next
page
under
subsection
(b)
(2)
on
page
3
and
it
says,
"term
extortion
means
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another
--
the
obtaining
of
property
from
another.”
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
statute
--
what
the
indictment
charges
here
that
the
defendants
attempted
to
obtain
the
property
from
another
in
a
form
of
wages.
now,
wages
are
property
and
therefore
that
element
of
the
statute
is
fulfilled.
and
the
second
element
is,
wrongful
use
of
actual
or
threatened
force,
violence
or
fear
or
under
color
of
official
right.
well,
under
color
of
official
right
does
not
have
any
pertinence
to
this
case
but
the
indictment
does
allege
the
wrongful
use
of
actual
or
threatened
force,
violence
and
fear.
i
stress
the
word
"and"
because
it's
not
forced,
violence
or
fear
it's
forced,
violence
and
fear
in
the
indictment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
wouldn't,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
but
i
don't
want
to
fall
into
this
trap
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
mr.
justice.
if
the
court
should
merely
hold
that
the
--
that
the
indictment
on
its
face
stated
the
crime
under
the
hobbs
act
and
didn't
go
on
to
discuss
the
real
issue
in
the
case,
which
is
extortion
of
featherbedding,
we
would
then
be
faced
with
exactly
the
same
problem
by
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that's
--
the
--
the
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
is
no
real
substantial
issue
in
the
case
then
because,
certainly,
if
the
indictment
alleged
only
what
the
statute
provided
it
might
be
that
--
that
on
proof
we
could
show
that
--
that
a
highway
robber
man
came
along
and
--
and
held
up
this
land.
and
--
and
we
of
course
not
be
--
we
would
not
be
presenting
and
the
court
would
not
be
deciding
the
real
issue
in
the
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
which
is
presented
by
the
statements
which
followed.
that
is,
that
--
that
the
property
which
was
obtained
are
wages
in
the
form
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
if
mr.
justice,
the
pleader
does
not
agree
--
agrees
that
this
additional
particularization
is
not
superfluous
and
we
do
not
think
it
is
superfluous.
we
think
it
is
the
gist
of
the
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
think
he
was
talking
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
he
was
talking
about
the
provision
in
the
indictment,
the
provision
of
the
indictment
which
refers
to
money
in
the
form
of
wages.
this
is
the
top
of
page
2
reading
from
count
1.
money
in
the
form
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
of
wages
--
of
the
record
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
money
in
a
form
of
wages
to
be
paid
for
imposed,
unwanted,
superfluous,
and
fictitious
services
of
laborers
commonly
--
commonly
known
as
swampers.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
the
judge
was
interpreting
the
indictment
to
provide
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
i'm
free
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
i'm
free
to
discuss
the
evidence
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
which
is
not
here.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
not.
i
think
the
judge
who
after
all
was
an
experienced
trial
judge
and
was
--
and
knew
that
you
can
only
grant
a
--
a
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment
under
rule
34
of
the
criminal
rules
on
two
grounds.
that
is
if
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
or
that
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
indictment
didn't
state
those
things.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
he
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
he
was
interpreting
the
indictment
which
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
as
a
reasonable
interpretation
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
at
the
trial?
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
evidence
as
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
don't
--
i
--
i
think
it
was
--
it
was
an
issue
which
was
attempted
to
be
raised.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
indictment
alleged
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
indictment
alleges
that
a
disagreement
between
a
labor
union
and
the
contractors,
the
labor
union
is
one
of
the
defendants
and
it
says
that
the
labor
union
attempted
to
--
to
get
the
contractor
to
agree
to
something
and
that's
a
labor
dispute
and
it
says
in
what
way?
they
wanted
the
contractor
to
employ
swampers.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
indictment
alleges
that
this
took
place
at
a
certain
part
of
the
county
of
madison,
in
the
state
of
illinois
and
that's
what
he
was
referring
to.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
district
judge
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
but
i
think
that
the
district
judge
and
--
and
--
i
think
we
have
to
know
that
the
district
judge
was
acting
under
rule
34
which
is
limited
and
--
and
what
the
test
of
the
district
judge
can
do.
he
says,
he
was
granting
a
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment
and
not
a
motion
for
acquittal.
if
he
did
grant
a
motion
of
acquittal,
we
might
think
it
wrong
but
we
couldn't
come
here.
he
denied
the
motion
for
acquittal
and
he
denied
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
if
you
take
into
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
justice,
i
think
if
you
read
the
entire
opinion
including
the
part
where
he
talks
about
the
main
difficulty
that
i
find
with
these
proceeding
is
the
charge
in
the
indictment.
that's
how
he
start
his
opinion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
fairly
construed
this
opinion
discusses
the
evidence.
i
think
the
judge
was
attempting
to
rest
his
--
his
decision
on
the
indictment
and
of
course
on
his
construction
of
the
hobbs
act.
and
that's
the
type
of
case
which
we
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
could
have
been
that
because
he
denied
the
judgment
for
--
of
a
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal.
he
denies
that
specifically.
and
this
opinion
starts
out
by
saying
he
denies
the
motion
for
judgment
--
acquittal.
and
the
order
of
the
court
says,
he
denies
it
twice.
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
and
he
talked
about
a
similar
indictment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
indictment.
i
think
he
--
perhaps
in
a
somewhat
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
inartistic
way,
the
judge
was
simply
construing
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
--
the
indictment
alleges
that
where
this
happened
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
on
in
--
on
the
basis
of
an
affidavit
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
mean,
an
indictment
which
was
similar.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
think
he
was
talking
about
the
practice,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
he
was
talking
about
what
was
alleged
in
the
indictment.
what
the
actual
proof
was,
was
not
before
him
at
the
time.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
a
non-reported
case
referred
to
at
the
bottom
of
page
16,
united
states
against
(inaudible)
et
al.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
what
judge
moore
did.
i
haven't
looked
at
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
even
know
that
he
did
turn
him
loose,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
--
i
have
no
knowledge
about
those.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
that
isn't
the
question.
the
question,
i
think,
mr.
justice
is
what
this
judge
ruled
as
to
this
indictment
and
we
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
says
after
reading
the
indictment,
mr.
justice
black,
i
concur
with
the
decision
of
judge
moore
in
a
similar
indictment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
southern
district
of
illinois.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
missouri.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
if
that
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
haven't
looked
for
it
and
i
haven't
found
it.
it
isn't
--
no,
i'm
sure
it
isn't
recorded
because
if
it
were
it,
it
would
be
under
the
annotations
and
i've
seen
all
the
cases
under
the
annotations
of
the
statutes
so
i'm
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
where
judge
adair's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
--
the
allegation
of
the
indictment
is
that
this
occurred
in
madison
county
in
southern
illinois.
judge
adair
is
the
district
judge
or
was
the
district
judge
for
the
southern
district
of
illinois.
the
case
was
actually
tried
in
quincy,
illinois,
and
little
further
north.
before
i
sit
down,
i
would
like
to
say
that
--
that
the
legislative
history
of
this
case
of
--
in
relation
to
this
statute
is
overwhelming,
absolutely
overwhelming.
about
15
years
ago
this
court
had
a
case,
united
states
against
dickerson
in
310
u.s.in
which
the
words
of
the
statute
appeared
upon
it
one
way
but
the
legislative
history
appeared
overwhelmingly
to
point
the
other
and
in
that
case
the
court
shows
the
legislative
history
over
the
words
of
the
statute.
but
we
have
here
a
case,
we
think,
where
the
words
of
the
statue
point
the
same
direction
as
the
legislative
history
overwhelmingly
points.
i
don't
have
time
orally
to
go
into
all
the
--
all
the
elements
of
the
legislative
history.
but,
i
think
that
if
the
court
will
review
both
the
hearings
and
the
--
and
the
reports
and
the
actual
debates
in
congress,
they
will
say
that
prime
purpose,
the
purpose
stated
again
and
again
and
again
throughout
the
debates
of
--
of
this
--
of
the
statute,
the
hobbs
act
was
to
overturn
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
1942
in
the
local
807
case
where
this
court
held
that
practices
which
we
think
are
comparable
to
this
were
not
within
the
former
anti-racketeering
statute
because
it
had
certain
exceptions
with
relation
to
labor.
exceptions
for
a
bona
fide
wages
paid
to
a
bona
fide
employees
by
a
bona
fide
employers.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
dickerson
case
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
310
u.s.
that,
of
course,
mr.
justice,
doesn't
relate
to
this
statute.
it's
just
a
--
and
immediately
proceeding
that
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
an
immediate
proceeding
of
that
decision
of
the
dickerson
case
is
the
decision
in
which
you
were
the
author,
united
states
against
american
trucking
association
where
you
also
relied
very
heavily
on
legislative
history.
so,
i
say
he
had
the
legislative
history
coincides
and
reinforces
the
words
of
the
statute
because
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
one
goes
to
the
legislative
history,
that
the
prime
purpose
of
congress
was
to
overturn
the
ruling
in
the
local
807
case
and
to
make
featherbedding
a
federal
crime
if
it
affected
interstate
commerce
and
if
featherbedding
was
compelled
by
force
and
violence.
now,
a
good
deal
has
been
said
in
the
brief
of
my
brother
about
featherbedding
not
being
a
crime,
it
just
so.
well,
of
course
not.
this
is
featherbedding
compelled
by
force
and
violence.
that's
what
congress
was
getting
after.
they
wanted
to
prevent
people
from
being
compelled
to
hire
employees
whom
they
didn't
want,
compelled
by
force
and
violence.
and
the
--
the
whole
--
not
only
the
drift
but
the
whole
drive
of
the
legislative
history
and
of
the
amendments
which
congress
rejected
including
amendments
by
congressman
cuellar
and
congressman
la
follette,
indiana
which
would
have
preserved
some
of
the
argument
for
which
the
appellees
are
contending.
the
whole
drive
of
that
history
was
in
the
direction
of
the
position
in
which
the
overnment
is
contending
for
here
and
which
the
third
circuit
adopted
in
the
kemble
case
and
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
about
two
years
ago.
and
that
is
that
where
an
indictment
alleges
that
featherbedding
was
compelled
by
force
and
violence.
it
is
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
because
it
constitutes
extortion
under
--
under
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice,
you
don't.
all
that's
here
is
the
indictment
which
alleges
sufficiently
the
force
and
violence.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
construe
the
indictment
is
alleging
that
all
--
that
what
this
union
and
this
business
agent
were
doing
were
attempting
to
get
these
contractors
to
employ
men
but
--
and
if
they
had
not
used
force
and
violence,
they
would
lawfully
have
been
able
to
get
these
contractors
to
employ
these
men.
if
for
instance
they
had
done
it
by
picketing
or
by
negotiating,
there's
no
doubt
that
it
would
not
have
been
a
violation
of
any
--
any
statute
federal
or
state
to
hire
these
men.
and
he
--
what
he
is
saying
is
that
i
can't
think
that
a
--
a
congress
made
an
activity
of
this
type
to
be
unlawful,
merely
because
force
and
violence
were
used.
and
--
and
that's
what
he
says.
in
the
next
paragraph,
it
seems
in
--
on
page
16
after
he
cites
the
two
cases
in
this
court
which
as
he
construe
the
indictment
would
make
the
employment
of
these
swampers
to
be
perfectly
legal
because
they
were
actually
gonna
do
the
work.
then
he
says,
it
seems
incongruous
that
congress
intended
a
lawful
action
on
the
part
of
green
in
demanding
money
in
the
form
of
wages
from
the
contractor
to
being
paid,
for
imposed
unwanted,
and
fictitious
services
of
laborers
accompanied
by
either
threats
of
force
and
violence,
which
under
state
law
accounted
only
misdemeanors
can
be
punished
as
a
severe
felony.
he
is
looking
simply
we
think
at
the
--
at
the
indictment
as
he
construes
it
and
he
construes
the
indictment
to
provide
that
--
that
what
they
were
doing
would
be
lawful
if
the
force
and
violence
perhaps
and
we
agree
to
that.
and
so
therefore,
we
think
it
is
a
construction
of
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that's
just
a
side
remark
that
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
after
all,
mr.
justice,
this
did
take
place
after
the
--
after
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
he
says
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
he
is
talking
about
the
allegations
of
the
indictment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
think
what
he
is
saying,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
i
can't
believe
that
where
a
labor
union
is
--
is
trying
to
get
employment
and
this
is
a
customary
activity
in
the
--
or
this
is
done
in
--
in
areas
that
congress
meant
to
outlaw
that
kind
of
activity.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no.
if
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
he
acquitted
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
--
if
the
judge
meant
that
on
the
evidence
he
held
with
the
defendants
rather
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
true.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
i
--
i
recall
again
to
you
mr.
justice
black
that
he
starts
out
of
his
opinion
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
motion
for
judgment
acquittal
are
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right
under
rule
34
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
question
which
we
understood
the
court
took
when
it
made
a
probable
jurisdiction
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
nefarious?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
not
only
did
he
say
an
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
arrest
of
judgment
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
one
--
one
needn't
agree
to
that,
though
i
think
that's
a
permissible
interpretation
of
what
was
done.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
only
answer
i
can
think,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
--
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
appellee
and
the
judge
calls
it
that
way.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
judge
does
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
hard
question,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
not
--
it's
not
my
place
to
--
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
member
of
the
court
is
attacking
the
judge's
motive.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
think
that's
correct.
but
may
i
call
the
attention
of
mr.
justice
black,
one
more
thing,
one
more
material
element
in
this
dispute.
on
page
18
of
the
record,
the
judge
sustains
the
emotion
for
arrest
of
judgment
solely
on
the
grounds
here
and
above
set
forth
solely.
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
on
page
17
and
18.
this
is
the
order
on
the
motion.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
he's
talking
about
the
immediate
grounds
set
forth
above
in
--
on
page
17,
immediately
above
in
--
in
his
order
in
which
he
quotes
from
the
part
of
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
in
which
the
appellees
quite
properly
move
under
rule
34
for
arrest
of
judgment.
and
under
the
grounds
which
rule
34
says
that
you
can
use
for
a
motion
for
arrest
of
judgment.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
the
page,
mr.
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
appellees.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
their
motion
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
motion
which
the
defendants
made
appears
in
the
record
at
pages
12
and
13
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
is
limited
to
the
--
to
the
grounds
which
one
can
raise
under
rule
