mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
the
court
please.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
i
tried
this
case
merely
to
follow
because
they
convicted
my
client.
but
during
the
--i
think
it
did
take
either
nine
days
to
try
the
motion
at
that
time,
practically
orderly,
was
consumed
by
evidence.
now,
its
utterly
impossible
to
say
to
judge
adair
and
i
have
in
mind
what
the
court
--
this
court
has
repeated
--
not
to
repeatedly
but
several
times
said,
that
we
look
at
the
substance
not
merely
at
the
name.
now,
i
cannot
conclude
at
all.
judge
adair
was
an
able
man
but
was
not
a
well
man.
in
fact,
he
died
about
six
or
seven
weeks
ago.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
judge
adair
who
tried
this
case.
his
home
was
at
quincy.
mr.
frankfurter,
i
think
asked
his
home.
he
--
that
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
no,
sir.
that
is
over
in
adams
county,
carry
over
on
the
mississippi
river,
a
considerable
distance
away
from
the
--
and
it
is
northwest
of
alton
and
granite
city,
illinois
which
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
well,
the
adams
county
is
quincy
where
judge
adair
lived
and
where
this
case
was
tried.
and
madison
county
is
where
these
locks
are
located
around
the
chain
of
rocks
which
has
been
an
impediment
to
the
navigability
of
the
mississippi
river
and
it's
a
great
lock,
it's
the
largest
in
the
world
which
was
established
there.
there
is
a
footnote,
if
the
court
please,
i'm
supplementing
a
mere
reference
by
mr.
davis
to
the
--
or
duties
of
a
swamper
and
there's
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
i
forgot
on
what
page
it
was.
i
think
it's
--
it's
on
page
14
of
our
brief
with
reference
to
the
duties
of
a
swamper
and
they're
very
much
flagrant
of
course
than
the
reference
made
by
mr.
davis.
now,
i
want
to
--
on
our
brief
and
in
the
motions
that
we've
made
originally
for
the
dismissal
of
this
case
because
of
the
fact
this
was
not
in
fact
a
judgment
arresting
a
judgment
but
once
in
fact
a
judgment
because
i
thought
which
in
the
civil
law
is
commonly
called
non
obstante
veredicto.
i
still
think
that
that
is
what
it
is.
it's
utterly
impossible,
the
whole
purpose
that
your
honors
have
in
asking
and
--
making
a
part
of
your
rules
at
any
memorandum
opinion
or
an
opinion
of
the
court
rendering
a
decision
which
comes
before
your
honors
for
considerations
shall
be
--
shall
be
concluded
as
part
of
the
record.
now,
that
can
only
have
the
purpose
of
guiding
the
court.
of
course,
it
isn't
and
you
normally
am
sure
for
this
court
or
persons
who've
had
experience
and
they
practiced
in
order
to
realize
the
court's
after
all,
all
are
men.
judges
differ.
their
opinions
maybe
stated
one
way
when
in
fact
the
thing
that
they
have
in
mind
is
an
entirely
different
thing
than
that
which
is
said.
there
is
no
way
from
several
references
in
this
memorandum
opinion
of
the
judge
that
it
can
be
said
that
the
judge
was
referring
to
the
indictment,
when
he
said
i
conclude
in
the
case
--
case
at
hand
that
brings
original
activity
in
attempting
to
obtain
from
terry
his
money
in
the
form
of
wages
to
be
paid
and
--
for
imposed,
unwanted,
superfluous,
and
fictitious
services,
which
charge
was
seriously
controverted.
now,
how
could
that
be
controverted
from
anything
the
indictment
says.
it's
an
(inaudible)
it
couldn't
possibly
have
been.
this
opinion,
you
know,
the
judgment,
an
arrest
of
judgment
as
the
record
shows
was
returned,
was
entered
by
judge
adair
on
january
24th,
1955.
during
this
case,
returned
its
verdict
as
i
recall
it,
on
september
23rd,
the
year
before.
during
that
time
and
after
the
argument
of
this
case,
the
matter
of
opinion
before
the
court
took
some
considerable
time.
and
we
were
wondering
why
there
had
not
been
a
judgment
entered
upon
the
matter
of
which
we
would've
had
notice.
we
finally
--
we
didn't
receive
the
memorandum
opinion
and
a
copy
of
the
judgment
order
from
the
judge
which
we
had
no
knowledge
about
until
we
did
this,
as
i
say
some
four,
nearly
five
months
later.
now,
we
haven't
abandoned
it
but
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
up
just
anymore
unless
your
honors
desire
to
ask
questions
about
it,
upon
the
question
now
which
deals
with
whether
or
not
to
have
jurisdiction
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
authorizing
the
appeal
under
certain
circumstances
that
are
confined
with
the
court.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
they
have
not
been
shown,
a
mere
--
i
think
this
docket
entry
were
a
part
of
the
record.
i
had
hoped
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
yes.
it
involved
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
yes,
sir.
but
i
thought
that
the
record
here
does
show
those
docket
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
--
entries
of
the
filing
of
those
motions.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
what
page
is
that
on?
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
page
10,
i
think
it
is
your
honors.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
that's
the
only
of
course
that
the
--
the
government
as
--
to
mean
was
important
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
i
filed
a
motion
or
permission
to
print
this
entire
record.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
that
was
denied.
it
was
tendered
to
the
clerk
of
the
courts
$7000
from
that
purpose
for
the
reason
that
we
desire
to
have
the
court,
have
all
of
the
record.
i
thought
that
the
necessity
for
printing
our
motions
for
a
new
trial,
motions
for
directed
verdict,
conclusion
of
the
government's
case
and
again
the
conclusion
of
all
of
the
evidence
weren't
important
in
due
of
the
issue
that
was
presented
here
in
this
case.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
that's
right.
this
is
the
only
record
your
honor
has.
you
should've
asked
questions
about
whether
they
were
disputed
facts
that
the
court
was
referring
to,
mr.
davis
is
of
the
opinion,
of
course,
i
respect
it,
that
he
is
merely
referring
to
the
indictment.
but
i'm
utterly
unable
to
find
in
the
indictment
any
justification
for
that
conclusion.
i'll
go
on
to
the
thing
that
i
think
is
an
issue
in
this
case
and
mr.
davis
very
frankly
--
he
has
conceded
that
there
is
but
a
single
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
whether
featherbedding
and,
of
course,
he
faces
his
opponent
force
and
violence,
is
one
of
the
objects
of
the
hobbs
act.
let
us
go
to
the
copeland
act
that
was
passed
in
1934,
in
a
two-seven
decision
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
yes,
sir.
i
thought
i
had
stated
that.
i
meant
that
featherbedding
and
of
course
it
must
be
featherbedding
by
a
robbery
or
extortion
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
those
things.
that
means
force
and
violence
which
produces
that
result
as
well
as
having
an
intention
in
the
part
of
a
--
upon
the
part
of
the
robber
or
of
the
--
the
extorter.
i
want
to
go
over
the
act
in
this
case
because
the
construction
of
this
law,
it
seems
to
me,
is
essential
orderly
from
--
not
only,
and
i
am
very
pleased
here,
mr.
davis
says
that
he
would
like
to
submit
it,
a
form
of
congressional
record
of
what
the
purpose
of
the
act
was.
in
the
copeland
act
and
the
hobbs
act
of
1946
was
enacted
because
the
provision
in
the
copeland
act
set
--
that
it
modify
in
all
situations
although
there
has
been
in
effect
robbery
and
the
extortion
because
while
those
terms
were
not
used
in
the
copeland
act
and
were
embodied
in
both
the
original
hobbs
act
of
1946
and
the
codification
of
1948
had
nevertheless,
that
was
the
purpose
that
was
had
in
mind
that
from
the
very
time
that
that
statute
was
enacted,
first
enacted
it
was
known
as
the
anti-racketeering
or
labeled
in
the
code
or
was
the
racketeering
act.
that
is
all
that
have
been
always
been
carried
along
both
as
to
the
hobbs
act
for
resuming
as
to
the
codification.
for
the
first
time
in
the
act
of
1946,
the
hobbs
act,
the
first
one
before
the
codification
modified
it
a
little
but
not
in
substance,
the
terms
robbery
were
specifically
mentioned
and
extortion
also
was
specifically
mentioned.
primarily,
we're
talking
about
interference
from
congress,
i
mean
commerce,
interference
with
commerce
was
not
to
be
confused
with
crimes
merely
--crimes
which
are
interference
are
one
thing
but
the
regulation
of
commerce
primarily
is
a
regulation.
it
is
not
that
denouncement
of
a
felonious
charge
against
anyone
and
it
has
been
so
treated
and
treated
many
times.
now,
copeland
in
1934,
the
hobbs
in
april,
as
i
remember
of
1946,
the
lea
or
petrillo
act
in
june
of
1946,
the
taft-hartley
act
the
next
year
and
the
legislative
history
is
pretty
interesting
in
those
connections.
the
taft
--
senator
taft
said
that
the
had
that
reframed
because
they're
awaiting
for
a
decision
of
this
court,
the
validity
of
the
lea
act
where
the
finding
was
different
and
that
act
was
held
on
--
it
was
held
constitutional.
now,
i
think
without
question
in
my
mind
that
congress
has
the
power
if
it
desires
and
as
defined
because
there
are
no
common
law
definitions
of
crime
in
the
federal
laws.
if
it
defines
robbery
with
an
intent
and
this
order
is
implicit
in
robbery
and
in
extortion
upon
the
part
of
the
robber
or
the
extorter
to
take
from
one
by
force
and
threats
his
property,
money
or
whatever
it
is,
it's
personal
of
course.
and
that
those
threats
shall
compel
him
or
induce
him
both
on
contempt
and
the
(inaudible)
now,
if
congress
passes
such
a
law
then
of
course,
i
think
it
is
within
the
power
of
congress.
that
was
not
what
justice
adair
had
in
mind.
judge
adair
had
in
mind
that
under
the
indictment
in
this
case
where
although
the
word
"extortion"
is
used
the
facts
that
are
charged
as
the
basis
upon
which
that
extortion
charge
rest
is
nothing
but
featherbedding
and
those
words
that
are
used
in
this
statute
amounts
to
nothing
except
the
things
defined
in
the
lea
or
the
petrillo
act.
now,
that
decision
in
the
lea
or
petrillo
act
was
passed,
i
think,
as
i
remember
about
in
1900
--
no,
these
were
the
statutes.
i
--
i
don't
remember
just
the
date
of
the
lea
of
petrillo
act
and
that's
merely
because
i'm
getting
too
old,
i
have
a
good
memory.
but
prior
to
the
opinion
which
was
handed
down
by
this
court
in
that
case,
judge
taft
said
that
there
were
some
doubt
about
validity
and
that
the
matter
was
before
the
court
and
they
thought
they
would
abstain
the
--
not
do
anything
further
about
the
petrillo
or
the
lea
case
until
that
decision
was
handed
down
and
they
never
have
done
anything
since.
now,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
sensible
or
reasonable.
one,
that
where
it
works,
a
robbery
and
extortion
that
have
always
been
felonious
clients,
they're
not
regulatory
things
would
a
definition
that
even
the
stupidness,
federal
knows
which
are
faced
and
premised
upon
first
an
intent
to
commit
robbery
upon
the
part
of
the
robber
or
upon
the
part
of
the
extorter,
and
they're
so
close
kinship
between
kick
--
the
kickback
act
and
the
blackmailing
principle
that
they're
all
involved
in
that
larceny
thought.
they
are
all
implicitly
included
for
the
benefit
of
the
robber
or
the
extorter.
they're
not
doing
it
in
many
humane
ways.
there
isn't
anything
about
it
that's
charitable.
it's
a
selfish,
stupid,
rotten
thing
from
its
very
inception.
now,
if
it
were
the
intention
of
the
makers
of
the
hobbs
act
of
congress
when
they
passed
that
act
at
the
time
within
two
months
and
a
half
afterwards
when
they
passed
the
lea
act
to
have
said
that
featherbedding
was
to
be
included
in
it.
why
didn't
say
so?
they
did
pass
the
lea
act
after
the
decision
of
this
court
holding
that
it
was
constitutional.
they
did
nothing
about
it.
now,
in
featherbedding
as
the
most
prevalent
thing
in
the
world
generally
in
the
labor
union,
then
it
would
be
one
of
those
things
that
ought
to
be
definitely
designated.
judge
adair's
opinion
was,
in
my
judgment
when
he
said
withhold
--
to
hold
so
that
this
--
that
this
indictment
was
a
sufficient
indictment
under
the
hobbs
act
would
be
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
beyond
my
constitutional
limits
and
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
beyond
its
powers.
now,
what
does
that
mean?
it
means
just
what
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
amendments
of
the
constitution
were
adopted
for
that
person's
charge
would
a
felonious
crime,
those
are
the
infamous
crimes,
shall
be
specifically
informed.
it
is
not
essential
that
that
be
done
by
a
bill
of
particulars
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
indictment
that
complies
in
my
opinion
with
the
apparent
obligation
of
the
pleader
and
the
preparation
of
an
indictment
which
is
set
out
from
a
perspective
of
the
entire
hobbs
act
and
of
course
that's
what
the
court
always
does
in
construing
a
statute.
now,
just
one
other
thought
that
i
have.
i
don't
keep
time
very
well
and
i
presume
that
it
could
buzz
the
lights
when
i'm
nearly
through.
judge
adair
sought
that
to
construe
this
act
as
an
intention
upon
the
part
of
congress
to
want,
i
will
put
it
perhaps
i
would
say
insinuatingly,
though
in
fact
are
to
lure
a
person
into
a
sense
of
false,
security,
featherbedding
were
included
within
the
terms
and
intention
of
congress,
and
of
course
we
cannot
include
any
such
intention
to
congress.
congress
didn't
want
that.
congress
had
no
such
intention
and
congress
never
intended
that
any
construction
it
placed
upon
this
indictment,
which
would
violate
the
restraining
influence
and
sanitary
purposes
of
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
amendments
and
there
can
be
no
question
about
that.
now,
that
was
the
sole
meaning
and
the
sole
part
that
judge
adair
must
have
had.
unfortunately,
did
not
see
him.
i
happen
to
be
out
of
the
country
at
the
time
of
his
death,
so
i
don't
know
from
any
conversation
about
the
matter
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
it
is
from
the
person
he
had
served
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
that's
right.
force
and
violence
of
course
with
the
intention
your
honor.
and
we
must
keep
that
in
our
minds.
now,
in
the
local
807
case,
there
are
two
interesting
statements
that
are
found
there
and
the
government
contends
that
the
807
case
and
it
is
--
it
was
a
case
upon
which
there
was
initiated
the
bills
and
the
number
of
them
were
filed.
it
resulted
in
the
enactment
and
codification
of
the
hobbs
act
and
i
think
it
was
a
very
necessary
thing
to
do.
the
government
was
mistaken
when
it
said
that
we
thought
that
the
fact
that
a
person
was
a
member
of
a
labor
union
or
a
labor
union
was
immune.
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
merely
because
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
labor
union
or
a
member
of
it.
we
never
had
any
such
idea.
the
hobbs
act
applies
to
any
robber
or
to
any
extorter
whether
he
is
a
member
of
the
labor
union
or
salvation
army
or
the
united
states
army
or
any
of
the
organization
or
does
it
individually,
if
he
does
it
with
an
intention
to
rob,
and
implicit
in
that
in
all
robbery
is
that
it
is
with
a
selfish
person
--
selfish
reason
of
robbing
for
his
own
benefit.
now,
every
single
case
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
his
own
benefit.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
there's
no
altruism
in
robbery
or
extortion
--
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
(inaudible)
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
he
would
absolutely
be
a
robber.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
why
the
court
--
what
--
but
you
overlooked
the
thought.
he
gets
it
first.
give
afterwards,
either
his
conscience
or
because
he
thinks
that
he
will
in
some
way
atone
or
if
he
thinks
it
will
make
him
a
big
shot
locally
he
does
that.
still,
he
does
it
for
his
own
selfish
purpose.
that's
the
inherent
thing
in
both
of
those
crimes
and
there
is
not
a
single
conviction.
under
the
old
copeland
act
or
under
the
hobbs
act
where
that
is
not
the
facts,
we
go
back
to
the
old
companion
case
in
which
a
$1,100,000
was
gotten
by
a
buyout
from
the
motion
picture
industry.
and
every
other
case
that's
cited
by
the
government
or
found
by
us
is
a
case
in
which
personal
moneys
for
the
fellow
who
was
the
extorter
in
every
instance
were
kept
and
those
amounts
run
from
small
amounts
like
$7500
to
$50,000
to
$1,100,000.
that's
the
purpose
of
this
law.
justice
byrnes
said
in
this
majority
decision
in
the
807
case
in
replying
to
an
objection
of
the
government
that
the
objection
of
the
government
in
this
case
has
this
true
significance
that
it
places
an
added
burden
upon
the
prosecutor
rather
than
upon
the
accused.
that
is
the
prosecutor
must
first
establish
a
criminal
intent
upon
the
part
of
the
defendant
and
he
must
then
make
the
further
showing
with
respect
to
the
victim's
state
of
mind,
he
must
through
that
intent
and
the
accomplishment
of
the
fear,
fact
of
this
rule
is
to
run
through
a
conviction
of
robbery
more
rather
than
less
difficult.
now,
chief
justice
stone
would
dissent
it
clarifies
that
proposition.
you
said
the
robbers
forced
and
is
intended
effect
upon
the
victim
are
essential
elements
of
the
crime
both
of
which
the
prosecutor
must
prove.
jury
was
told
that
convict
--
it
must
plan
--
this
is
a
conspiracy
case,
find
conspiracy
or
agreement
where
respondents
violate
the
statute
and
that
they
must
have
--
must
have
the
purpose
or
intention
to
commit
the
crime.
as
i
have
said,
the
intention
to
commit
the
crime,
commit
the
offense
includes
the
intention,
to
use
force
and
violence
on
the
--
the
victim.
now,
in
view
of
the
history
in
the
long
known
thing
which
in
the
taft-hartley
act
designates
featherbedding
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
which
in
the
lea
act
is
made
a
misdemeanor
and
in
the
opinion
in
that
case
called
a
regulatory
law.
how
then
can
it
be
said
that
the
persons
bringing
and
any
members
of
the
union,
and
they
just
included
as
the
union
could
have
had
any
such
intent,
as
that's
implicit
and
as
the
term
"robbery"
as
defined
by
the
statute
itself
and
the
term
"extortion"
which
must
of
course
does
include
because
it's
a
basic
part
of
the
old
larceny
law,
the
same
necessary
essentials
that
is
important
in
the
definition
of
this
felonious
crime.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
these
people
had
such
an
intention
in
this
case
is
to
read
into
the
things
which
the
court's
opinion
showed
should
not
and
do
not
belong
to
that.
i
think
i
have
used
my
time.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
arthur
m.
fitzgerald
but
no
--
if
he
--
would
he
like
the
undertaker
(inaudible)
had
a
funeral
and
he
had
a
friend
who
was
a
real
estate
man
in
florida
and
after
the
little
talk
by
the
undertaker
about
asking
if
there
was
anyone
who
would
desire
to
say
anything
about
the
deceased
and
no
one
said
anything,
the
real
estate
man
came
up
and
he
said,
"well,
it
seems
nobody
else
is
going
to
talk.
i'd
like
to
tell
you
what
great
land
we
have
in
florida.”
it's
been
a
very
nice
thing
to
talk
to.
i
thank
you
very
much.
