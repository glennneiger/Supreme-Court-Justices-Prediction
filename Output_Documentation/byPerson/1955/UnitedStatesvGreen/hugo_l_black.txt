justice
hugo
l.
black
but
personally,
i
am
interested
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
--
if
you're
not
ready
to
these
questions,
of
course
we
consider
it
but
i
--
i
am
interested
in
that
point.
i'm
not
good
with
all
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
the
court
meant
by
this?
what
this
court
now
to
say
that
when
a
labor
organization
or
officer
of
said
organization
advocated
and
demanded
in
the
form
of
labor
which
has
been
customary
and
agreed
to
by
contractors
or
laborers
in
the
community
that
the
violation
of
this
particular
act
would
just
mean
to
be
unreasonable.
what
was
he
talking
about,
anything
in
the
indictment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
anything
there
about
the
showing
that
it
was
customary
or
not
customary
in
that
community
to
demand
what
he
was
demanding
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
was
a
dispute
about
that
in
the
evidence,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
that
particular
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
what
he
meant
here
and
frankly
it
looks
to
me
like
he
was
discussing
the
evidence,
not
the
indictment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
--
you're
talking
about
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
he
knew.
well,
what
he
mean
by
this?
i
conclude
that
the
trouble
in
this
community
and
all
the
particular
jobs
was
caused
by
a
disagreement
between
contractor
and
labor
and
was
in
nowise
an
attempt
to
extort
for
the
use
of
either
the
union
or
the
defendant
bringing
any
money
or
property
of
the
contractor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
everything
in
the
indictment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
was
there
any
evidence
with
reference
to
that
--
what
he's
talking
about
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
certainly,
that
was
the
issue,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
defendant's
claim
that
in
this
--
that
in
this
community
and
this
particular
job,
they
had
a
disagreement
between
the
contractor
and
the
laborer
and
that
it
was
not
an
attempt
to
extort
for
the
use
of
the
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
said
in
this
community.
what
he
mean
--
what
did
that
have
to
do
with
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment
if
it's
not
a
decision
on
the
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
indictment
say
anything
about
this
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
chief
argument
seems
to
be
that
we
must
assume
that
the
judge
is
so
familiar
with
this
group
that
he
wouldn't
have
discussed
it,
but
it
quite
--
looks
like
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
if
he
wasn't
--
if
he
wasn't,
the
question
--
what
he
was
intending
to
do
if
he
was
not
discussing
the
indictment
here
which
should
turn
him
loose
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
hasn't
shown
he
was
guilty,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
he
wasn't
talking
about
the
community
and
judge
moore's
community,
wasn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
talking
about
this
community.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
rule
--
suppose
the
practice
had
been
one
thing
in
judge
moore's
community.
would
this
judge
by
reason
of
his
supreme
knowledge
of
the
rules
have
had
a
right
to
judicially
know
that
the
practice
in
his
community
was
the
same
as
in
judge
moore's
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
was
judge
moore's
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
anything
about
how
judge
moore
turned
turn
him
loose
or
why
he
turned
him
loose
except
what
this
judge
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
we
find
it
in
any
book?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can't
rely
then
on
what
judge
moore
ruled
as
to
an
indictment,
can
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
the
judge
--
in
that
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
judge
moore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
saint
louis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
relevance
here
of
the
idea
of
--
it
being
controverted
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
side
remark?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
it
seriously
controverted
in
the
evidence,
that
--
that
allegation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
was
seriously
controverted
in
the
evidence
and
he
referred
to
that
and
said
this
allegation
indictment
was
here
and
seriously
controverted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
he
says
was
of
itself
not
a
violation
of
the
statute.
it
was
within
his
rights
and
responsibility
to
the
union
representative
which
was
not
prohibited
by
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
indictment
of
--
but
--
but
he
is
not
when
it
says
controverted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
referring
to
the
evidence
is
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this?
because
i'm
not
sure
--
i'm
not
sure
we've
ever
passed
on
it.
suppose
one
might
agree
with
you
that
he
was
construing
the
indictment
in
a
certain
way
and
having
construed
it
in
that
way,
he
acquitted
it,
could
you
appeal
it
anywhere?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
what
he
meant
here
was
that
this
allegation,
if
what
he
meant
in
the
allegation
was
that
it
was
seriously
controverted.
and
he
thought
that
evidence
was
enough
to
show
that
the
controverted
--
that
those
who
were
controverting
were
right
and
not
the
allegations.
then
he
is
acquitted
and
he
can't
be
tried
anymore.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
--
however,
he
construed
the
indictment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
he
construed
it
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
as
--
with
reference
to
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case,
we
don't
usually,
maybe
we
will,
but
we
don't
usually
look
around
with
a
microscope
to
try
to
find
at
some
place
where
he
says,
he'd
turn
him
loose
that
maybe
he
is
sorry
he
did
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
rule
was
before
the
court,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
do
--
but
i
want
to
see
if
you
agree
to
that
as
i
understood
it.
you
agree
that
in
order
to
hold
that
the
man
honestly
believed,
the
judge
honestly
believes
on
this
record,
that
a
man
acquitted
here,
that
he's
got
to
raise
the
conclusion
that
there
was
something
nefarious
about
what
judge
adair
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
was
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
skill
--
that
he
skillfully
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
concealed
was
he
was
trying
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
does
the
government
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
named
it
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
came
up
on
a
motion
--
suppose
the
motion
had
come
up
on
--
an
arrest
of
judgment
and
he
had
said
instead
of
saying
only
what
--
what
you
have
quoted
to
find
this
precise
type
that
we've
just
read,
would
you
say
--
would
you
read
that
as
an
intention
to
acquit?
he
had
never
said
that
he
was
ruling
on
the
indictment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
attack
the
judge's
motives,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
solely
on
the
ground
set
forth.
now,
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
the

the
