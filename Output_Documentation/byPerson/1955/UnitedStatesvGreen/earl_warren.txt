chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
pertinent
to
this
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
a
moment
ago
though
you
said
that
the
--
that
the
judge
just
--
the
trial
judge
just
looked
at
the
evidence
and
the
statute
and
came
to
this
conclusion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
the
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
may
--
i
may
have
done
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
did
he
construe
it
that
way
because
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
or
--
or
in
an
abstract
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
consider
the
evidence
at
all
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
moore?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
judge
moore's
opinion
reported
any
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
the
thing
that
concerns
me
is
that
the
trial
judge
said
at
the
outset,
he
determined
that
the
indictment
was
good
and
then
he
speaks
about
the
similarity
with
this
case
in
the
southern
district
--
the
eastern
district
of
missouri.
he
says
in
this
type
of
cases
the
original
demand
is
unlawful
and
certainty
the
means
to
carry
out
the
demand
in
those
cases
were
unlawful
and
within
the
purview
of
the
statute
and
the
constitutional
limits
of
congress
to
enact
statute
to
protect
interstate
commerce.
then
he
says
this,
â€œin
the
case
at
hand,
i
conclude
that
green's
original
activity
in
attempting
to
obtain
from
arthur
w.
terry,
jr.,
his
money
in
the
form
of
wages
to
be
paid
for
imposed,
unwanted,
superfluous
and
fictitious
services
of
laborers
which
said
charge
was
seriously
controverted,
was
of
itself
not
a
violation
of
this
statute."
now,
how
could
he
say
that
without
considering
the
evidence
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fitzgerald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
that?

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fitzgerald,how
--
how
do
we
differentiate
between
these
two
situations?
in
this
case,
you
have
a
misdemeanor
featherbedding
statute
and
then
a
long
term,
this
racketeering
statute,
assuming
that
congress
did
intend
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
make
the
featherbedding
by
force
and
violence
to
felony,
punishable
by
20
years
in
the
penitentiary.
now,
take
that
on
the
one
side
and
take
on
the
other
side
the
ordinary
situation
that
we
have
in
--
in
larceny
if
the
legislature
provides,
if
--
that
if
someone
steals
something
of
small
value
say
of
$5,
it's
a
misdemeanor.
but
if
it's
done
by
force
and
violence,
it's
robbery
and
a
felony.
now
how
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
distinguish
between
those
two?
chief
justice
earl
warren
robbing
--
what
was
that
last
phrase,
robbing
for
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
but
if
he
rob
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
he
rob
to
give
it
to
charity,
would
he
be
relieved
of
the
obligation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
be
a
robber,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
two
more
minutes
more
if
wish.
