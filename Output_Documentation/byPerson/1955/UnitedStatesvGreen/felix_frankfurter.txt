probable
means
the
question
is
may
be
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
want
to
take
your
time
on
that
point,
is
that
it?
you
don't
want
to
take
--
use
any
part
of
your
time
to
discuss
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
say
--
i
didn't
--
go
on,
finish
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
that
if
the
district
court
says,
i
find
that
the
allegations
at
the
indictment
do
not
charge
of
a
crime
under
the
statute
that
his
statement
is
conclusive
on
us
as
to
what
he
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
haven't
said
the
former
then
you'd
be
out
of
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
indictment
--
would
the
indictment
have
to
say
more
than
turn
to
the
statute
in
this
kind
of
a
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all
we
could
ask
for
a
bill
of
particulars
so
--
so
far
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
the
adequacy
of
allegations
told,
i
could
(inaudible)
you
need
to
go
beyond
understanding
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
the
--
i
don't
follow
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
suffices
and
used
the
terms
of
the
statute,
what
is
right
about
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
indictment
is
impregnable.
it
is
simply
alleging
that,
meaning
to
prove
whether
a
given
course
of
conduct,
a
specific
standards
or
events
do
constitute
extortion.
why
do
we
have
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
may
say,
i
suppose
--
i
think,
we
haven't
put
the
answer
to
my
question
in
light
of
what
just
it
is
that
while
extortion
just
allegedly
that
the
defendant
extorted
would
satisfy
the
requirement
of
criminal
procedure
if
the
pleader
goes
on
and
defines
what
it
means
by
extortion
then
you
have
the
right
confess
that
that
which
particularize
this
concept
is
extortion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
fore
part
of
the
sentence
which
justice
black
read.
its
--
judge
moore
in
saint
louis
where
the
--
and
could
this
--
and
the
jury
couldn't
have
talked
about
this
community?
justice
felix
frankfurter
similar
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
relied
on
what
judge
moore
did
in
a
different
community.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
is
that
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
judge
there
said,
refer
to
what
judge
moore
did
in
a
similar
indictment,
not
in
a
similar
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
judge
adair
(inaudible)
did
you
say
madison
county?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
--
what
county
is
it,
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
maybe
--
that
he
would
have
to
say
that
judge
adair
in
order
to
avoid
directing
an
acquittal
in
which
he
believe
in
order
to
avoid
granting
the
defendant
an
acquittal
for
which
he
thought
he
was
entitled
rather
--
rather
skillfully
(inaudible)
afterwards
guilty.
he
said
in
arrest
of
judgment
instead
of,
“i
directly
bring
in
a
verdict
of
acquittal”,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
they
hold
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
talking
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
would
have
to
do
that
because
an
acquittal
is
not
reviewable
but
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
is
reviewable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
either
here
or
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
in
order
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
his
right
to
an
acquittal
is
not
reviewable
by
the
court.
he
was
great
to
deal
in
the
property,
to
use
another
word,
that
in
arrest
of
judgment
nor
to
deprive
him
of
his
right
to
be
acquitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what's
the
act
--
just
give
me
the
answer
to
that
interpretation
that
if
he
was
entitled
to
the
acquittal,
it
was
the
duty
of
--
of
conscientious
judge
to
order
and
acquittal
and
not
deprive
him
of
that
right
under
the
constitution
by
calling
it
a
motion
of
arrest
of
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judgment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
appellee,
the
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
acquitting
the
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
acquitting
instead
of
attacking
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
may
i
ask
one
more?
it
is
now
contented
that
it
could
--
it
is
now
contended
that
the
indictment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
50,
the
last
paragraph.
it
is
now
contended
that
the
indictment
does
not
heretofore
that
that
--
it
is
the
meaning
of
the
above
section.
who
contended
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
said
this
indictment
doesn't
make
out
a
case
under
the
statute.
that's
what
the
court
was
considering
and
he
so
find.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
the
determination
of
the
statute
and
i
don't
understand
elementary
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
right
of
then
myself,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
at
adams
county?
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
(inaudible)
naming
your
county,
did
they
have
both
in
adams
and
in
madison
county.
