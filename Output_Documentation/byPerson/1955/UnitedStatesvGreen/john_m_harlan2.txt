justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
consider
there's
any
ambiguity
in
the
record
at
all,
as
to
whether
he
went
on
the
indictment
only
or
whether
it
was
a
sort
of
a
combination
of
indictment
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
didn't
your
indictment
alleging
more
than
that?
what
about
fictitious?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
so
far
as
there
are
no
services
at
all?
