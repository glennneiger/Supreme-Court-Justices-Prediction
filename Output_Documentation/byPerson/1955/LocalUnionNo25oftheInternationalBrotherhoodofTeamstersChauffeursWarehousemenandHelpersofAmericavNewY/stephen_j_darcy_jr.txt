mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
sir.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
superior
court
for
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
the
question
was
limited
as
follows.
does
the
labor
management
relations
act
oust
state
courts
of
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
by
a
railroad
to
enjoin
a
union
and
union
representatives
from
engaging
in
peaceably
conducted
strikes
or
attempts
to
undo
such
strikes
by
the
employees
of
interstate
motor
carriers
for
the
purpose
of
persuading
such
carriers
to
agree
to
restrict
their
use
of
interstate
railroad
transportation
facilities
and
to
give
some
portion
of
such
interstate
carriage
work
to
their
employees
who
are
all
represented
by
the
union.
now,
the
respondent
railroad
company
is
a
common
carrier
by
rail
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
to
the
railway
labor
act.
since
approximately
december
of
1937,
this
particular
railroad
has
engaged
in
the
operation
of
hauling
flatcars
loaded
with
truck
trailers
of
the
type
ordinarily
hauled
over
the
highways
by
a
motor
truck.
the
operation
is
known
in
the
trade
and
popularly
as
piggy-backing.
this
operation
is
carried
on
between
several
cities
in
new
england
and
new
york,
principally
boston
to
new
york
and
vice
versa.
the
petitioner
union
is
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
drivers
and
helpers,
employed
by
motor
carriers
in
the
boston
area
and
has
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
those
motor
carriers
who
operate
from
the
boston
area.
the
union
does
not
represent
any
employees
of
the
railroad.
the
individual
petitioners
are
officers
and
representatives
of
the
union.
the
process
of
piggy-backing
is
accomplished
in
the
boston
area
by
having
loaded
trailers
drawn
by
motor
trucks
to
the
railroad
yard,
known
as
yard
5
in
boston.
those
trucks
are
operated
by
employees
of
motor
carriers
who
are
the
members
of
this
organization.
there,
the
trailers
are
driven
or
rather
taken
by
mechanical
devices
by
employees
of
a
railroad
subsidiary,
the
new
england
transportation
company.
that
transportation
company
is
a
trucking
company
and
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
those
employees
of
new
england
transportation
are
also
represented
by
the
same
union
and
the
union
has
a
contract
with
that
same
new
england
transportation
company.
those
employees
then
take
the
trailers
and
put
them
on
the
flatcars
from
which
point
railroad
employees,
specifically,
railroad
employees,
tie
the
so-called
trailer
on
to
the
flatcars
so
that
it
can
be
hauled.
for
some
years
as
the
state
court
had
found
here,
the
union
had
been
disturbed
about
piggy-backing
because
it
felt
that
the
practice
diminished
the
opportunities
of
employment
of
the
members
of
the
organization.
during
the
negotiation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
the
motor
carriers
from
1946
up
through
the
contract
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
this
action
commenced,
the
union
had
made
proposals
which
would
have
tendered
to
restrict
the
haulage
of
these
trailers
on
the
piggy-back
system.
the
evidence
in
the
record
discloses
that
the
union
had
made
such
a
proposal
and
finally
--
ultimately
those
contractual
proposals
did
not
appear
in
the
contract.
after
the
contracts
were
--
were
agreed
upon,
discussions
and
negotiations
continued
between
the
union
and
various
individual
motor
carriers
as
appears
in
the
record
and
they
came
to
individual
agreements
respecting
the
shipment
and
the
number
of
trailers
to
be
shipped
through
their
system.
those
agreements
were
not
uniform.
they
were
diverse
depending
upon
the
particular
carrier
the
union
negotiated
with.
there
were
also
discussions
and
there
had
been
an
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
--
issue
raised
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
substantially,
yes,
your
honor.
as
is
indicated
by
the
record
and
as
the
railroad
has
contended,
that
brings
the
case
within
the
so-called
jacobs
case
from
the
second
circuit
where
the
union
had
raised
the
problem
of
negotiations.
but
on
the
basis,
we
feel
of
the
record
in
this
case,
it
cannot
be
established
that
this
contract
was
within
--
or
the
negotiations
were
within
the
framework
and
the
realm
of
the
jacobs
case
because
it
was
a
proposal,
there's
no
evidence
as
to
the
amount
of
time
consumed
or
the
amount
of
discussions
that
went
on
with
relation
to
that
particular
proposal.
now,
on
july
11th
of
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
acts
complained
of.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
oh,
no,
sir.
the
new
england
transportation
company
was
not
particularly
involved
in
sending
their
own
trailers
on
flatcars.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
by
other
companies.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
union
had
no
negotiation
at
anytime
with
new
england
with
respect
to
new
england
employees
not
tying
or
not
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
--
putting
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
your
question.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
--
it
also
was
a
motor
carrier.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sir,
all
the
employees
of
new
england
transportation
were
represented
by
this
union
who
had
a
contract
covering
them.
and
the
segment
of
the
new
england
employees
at
the
railroad
yard
were,
i
believe,
a
small
proportion
of
the
total
number
of
new
england
employees.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
not
particularly.
not
particularly,
as
i
say
--
as
i
started
to
say,
sir,
the
union
had
raised
an
issue
that
under
a
particular
clause
in
the
contract,
it
prohibited
the
shipment
of
these
trailers
on
flatcars.
that
--
that
was
an
issue
which
had
been
raised
and
the
state
court
found
that
the
contract
did
not
prohibit
the
shipment
of
these
trailers
on
the
flatcars.
now,
on
july
11th
of
1952,
two
business
representatives
of
the
union
appeared
at
--
on
the
street
outside
of
yard
5
of
the
railroad.
and
as
the
original
state
court
trial
decision
found
on
a
preliminary
injunction
proceeding,
they
hailed
and
signaled
drivers
of
the
motor
carriers
and
persuaded
them
not
to
enter
upon
the
rail
yard
premises.
as
the
later
trial
judge
at
the
hearing
on
the
merits
and
as
affirmed
by
the
supreme
judicial
court,
the
activity
was
found
to
constitute
picketing
of
the
railroad
yard
and
inducement
of
the
new
england
transportation
company
employees
not
to
engage
in
their
ordinary
work
in
order
that
the
railroad
might
be
forced
to
stop
doing
business
with
the
motor
carriers
and
also
to
force
the
motor
carriers
to
stop
doing
business
with
the
railroad
and
therein
does
the
conflict
lie.
they
persuaded
also
as
they
say
according
to
the
state
court
findings,
the
new
england
employees
not
to
--
not
to
engage
in
their
ordinary
work.
the
case
came
on
up
through
the
state
court
after
several
hearings
on
injunction
then
the
merits
and
then
before
the
supreme
judicial
court.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
union
that
the
activities
of
which
the
railroad
complained
and
has
set
forth
in
their
bill
of
complaint
their
substitute
bill
of
complaint
and
their
amended
substitute
bill
of
complaint
in
the
state
court
proceedings
clearly
accused
the
union
of
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
so-called
taft-hartley
or
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947.
the
state
court
found
that
we
claim
to
have
permitted
such
unfair
labor
practices.
what
we
had
claimed
was
that
the
state
court
had
found
we
engaged
in
such
unfair
labor
practices,
and
that
brings
us
to
another
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
picketing
was
primary
as
to
the
motor
carriers
whether
or
not
it
was
secondary
as
to
the
railroad.
and
the
whole
problem
of
whether
or
not
reasonably
upon
reading
the
pleadings
that,
the
bill
of
complaint
and
the
defendant's
answers
in
the
state
court,
this
is
within
the
doctrine
of
the
weber
and
the
garner
cases.
the
weber
against
anheuser-busch
and
garner
against
teamsters
union
in
which
garner
of
course
holds
that
where
the
acts
complained
to
have
constituted
an
unfair
labor
practices
--
unfair
labor
practices
within
the
meaning
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
clearly,
a
state
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
also
enjoin
such
activities.
the
original
primary
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
who
administratively
under
the
statute
has
set
up
procedures
for
the
expeditious
--
most
expeditious
and
priority
handling
of
such
type
of
charges
through
to
the
mandatory
injunction
processes
before
federal
district
courts.
it
is
the
position
of
the
union
that
their
activity
was
protected
under
section
7
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
because
it
was
in
furtherance
of
collective
bargaining
or
attempts
to
collectively
bargain
with
the
motor
carriers
and
get
them
to
come
to
some
type
of
agreement
or
let's
agree
that
we
have
come
to
no
agreement
at
least
to
induce
collective
bargaining
in
good
faith
upon
that
respect
--
with
respect
to
the
issue.
within
the
doctrine
of
weber
against
anheuser-busch,
it
should
have
been
viewed
by
the
state
court
that
all
these
proceedings
and
the
acts
complained
of
by
the
railroad
petitioner
there
ought
reasonably
to
be
within
that
area
of
labor
relations
which
the
national
act
is
designed
to
administer
and
determine.
since
the
brief
was
prepared,
i
have
come
across
in
respect
to
the
railroad's
position
they
claim
that
the
railroad
could
not
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
by
virtue
of
the
international
rice
milling
case.
i
might
point
out
in
connection
with
the
international
rice
milling
case
that
no
railroad
filed
a
charge
in
that
case.
the
charge
was
filed
by
a
milling
company.
and
my
understanding
is
that
the
labor
relations
board
permitted
the
railroad
to
participate
as
amicus
curiae
in
the
case.
when
the
case
came
here,
that
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
railroad
is
an
employer
under
the
so-called
taft-hartley
was
not
raised
here
by
the
labor
board.
and
it
had
been
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
railroad
was
such
an
employer.
our
contention
is
that
it
does
not
matter
whether
the
railroad
is
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4),
the
so-called
secondary
boycott
provision
of
the
taft-hartley
law.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
are
a
person
or
whether
or
not
the
board
has
jurisdiction
over
the
party
who
was
claimed
to
have
committed
this
unfair
labor
practice.
going
further,
the
board
has
recently
held
in
a
non-reported
decision
and
i
provided
the
clerk
with
certified
--
a
certified
copy
of
the
decision
plus
other
copies
on
august
30th
of
this
year
involving
the
kohler
company
and
united
automobile
workers
of
the
cio.
i
think
we're
probably
all
familiar
with
the
fact
there
has
been
a
--
a
long
standing
labor
dispute
and
strike
and
picketing
by
the
uaw
of
the
kohler
company
and
that
in
accordance
with
the
board's
complaint,
they
alleged
that
the
union
engaged
in
unlawful
secondary
boycott
activities
under
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
taft-hartley
by
picketing
the
city
of
milwaukee
that
ran
docking
facilities
and
by
picketing
the
chicago
and
northwestern
railway
company,
who
was
alleged
in
the
general
counsel's
complaint
to
be
a
railroad
employer
just
as
the
new
haven
railroad
here
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
prior
to
them
and
under
the
act
prior
to
one
and
also
to
the
railway
labor
act.
the
board's
order
--
ordered
the
union
to
seize
picketing,
that
employer
confined
its
picketing
to
kohler.
i
point
that
out
to
show
that
the
contention
that
if
a
charge
had
been
filed
by
a
railroad
with
the
national
labor
relations
board,
it
would
have
been
processed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
board's
rules
and
the
act
itself
on
section
10
only
provide
that
when
it
has
charged,
that
when
a
person
charges
an
unfair
labor
practice,
the
law
of
the
case
does
not
change.
it
doesn't
matter
who
files
the
particular
charge.
now,
my
brother
has
also
contended
that
in
approaching
the
application
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
this
case
as
did
mr.
justice
ronan
in
the
supreme
judicial
court.
the
conclusion
was
that
the
railroad
was
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
railroad
employees
are
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act
and
all
their
relationships
with
each
other
are
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
therefore,
the
railroad
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
taft-hartley
act.
but
the
activities
complained
of
in
this
particular
case
do
not
involve
any
relationship
between
railroads
and
its
employees.
there
is
no
finding
nor
had
--
nor
was
there
any
accusation
that
the
union
induced
railroad
employees
to
do
something
or
to
refrain
from
doing
anything.
all
the
activity
was
directed
to
the
motor
carriers.
under
the
leading
cases
now,
it
can
still
be
argued
very
disputably
as
to
whether
or
not
the
particular
picketing
engaged
in
by
the
union
agents
was
primary
or
was
secondary.
and
i
think
those
were
the
precise
problems
which
this
court
has
pointed
out
within
the
area
of
the
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
first
instance
in
order
--
and
to
be
tried
in
state
courts
or
not
to
be
brought
here
and
determine
here
on
proceedings
arising
out
of
state
courts.
now,
the
brunt
of
the
railroad's
argument
then
shifts
to
the
averment
that
the
activity
in
which
the
union
agents
engaged
was
not
protected
by
section
7
of
the
law
and
therefore
was
within
the
doctrine
of
the
international
union
uaw
against
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
board,
the
briggs
stratton
case,
were
based
upon
the
state
court
findings,
this
court
determined
that
total
intermittent
stoppages
or
unannounced
ends
were
not
protected
activity
under
section
7
of
the
taft-hartley
law.
we
do
not
have
in
this
situation
total
intermittent
stoppages
for
unannounced
purposes
as
we
plead
in
the
record,
as
we
have
carefully
cited
in
the
brief
just
what
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
was
as
the
court
found
it
to
be
picketing,
it
was
not
unstated
purposes.
the
aims
were
always
clear
and
known
to
everybody.
the
railroad
also
claims
that
this
activity
being
ambulatory
picketing
was
not
protected
under
section
7.
but
in
establishing
even
if
that
were
true
that
this
is
ambulatory
picketing
and
therefore
unprotected,
they
are
establishing
that
what
it
is,
is
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
which
brings
the
case
clearly
within
the
garner
doctrine
again.
they
claimed
that
the
activity
is
unprotected
because
it
was
a
breach
of
contract
and
they
cite
the
mead
case
in
which
the
same
union
was
also
involved
and
the
mead
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
if
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
under
section
301
of
taft-hartley,
an
employer
may
go
to
court
and
sue
because
of
that
breach.
we
admit
that
those
possibilities
were
available
here
if
they
were
a
breach.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
established
upon
this
record
that
they
were
a
breach
because
it
cannot
be
established
on
this
record
that
the
dispute
concerning
the
flat
car
hauling
of
loaded
trailers
was
a
dispute
or
agreements
which
were
subject
to
the
arbitration
agreements
procedure
under
the
contract
then
in
effect.
they
say
that
the
purpose
then
of
the
stoppage
was
to
breach
the
contract.
well,
the
only
purpose
it
could've
had
if
it
were
breach
in
the
contract
would
have
been
to
demand
from
the
employer
motor
carriers
a
modification
of
that
contract
insofar
as
it
did
not
govern
the
relationships
concerning
these
flatcars
and
the
flat
car
hauling
of
trailers.
carrying
that
one
step
further,
it
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
section
8
(d)
of
the
taft-hartley
law
which
requires
that
no
labor
organization
or
employer
either
shall
engage
in
a
strike
or
a
lockout
for
the
purpose
of
terminating
or
modifying
any
agreement
without
first
having
giving
60
days
notice
to
the
other
party
and
then
within
30
days
thereafter
in
giving
notice
to
the
federal
and
the
state
mediation
and
conciliation
services
in
order
to
avoid
the
dispute.
thus
clearly,
if
the
purpose
were
to
modify
the
contract,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
8
(d)
and
very
likely
then
also
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(3)
by
virtue
of
which
the
union
would
be
engaging
and
bargaining
in
bad
faith.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
july
15,
1952,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
they
have
a
contract,
it's
rather
a
complex
one,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir,
by
virtue
of
the
injunction
under
state
court
decree.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
it
doesn't
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
no
agreement
this
year,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
problem
was
not
raised
on
negotiations
again
because
of
the
framework
of
the
state
court
injunction.
and
i
might
say
this,
the
state
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
the
state
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
would
look
at
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
would
look
at
the
very
broad
decree
of
injunction
which
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir,
from
any
inducement
of
--
of
any
kind
of
preventing
the
railroad
from
engaging
in
this
business.
any
inducement
of
any
kind
directly
or
indirectly
and
it
was
worded
very
broadly
and
that
original
injunction
was
issued,
ex
parte
and
without
notice
and
has
never
been
changed
except
as
to
a
final
decree
with
respect
to
the
amicus.
that's
been
in
effect
since
the
day
it
was
procured
ex
parte
without
notice.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
you
mean
this.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
been
the
fact,
sir.
i
might
point
out
that
--
and
it's
not
in
the
record
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
--
in
the
negotiations
after
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
will
note
in
august
of
1952
in
the
record,
there
was
a
motion
for
modification
of
the
decree
and
while
the
grounds
for
the
modification
are
not
set
forth
in
the
record,
the
argument
that
was
raised
and
that
i
raised
at
the
time
was
that
precisely
what
the
decree
does
is
enjoin
us
from
attempting
to
bargain
about
this
problem
and
the
court
refused
to
modify
the
decree.
now,
as
i
say
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
when
--
when
the
case
was
--
was
adjudicated
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
as
you'll
note
in
their
opinion
any
of
the
other
issues
except
the
affirming
of
the
final
decree
were
disregarded
in
accordance
with
massachusetts
law
because
that's
what
they
were
after,
review
of
the
final
decree
and
since
they
found
that
to
be
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
--
lawful.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
[laughs]
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it
was
sir
and
i
raised
it
and
they
cited
cases
like
the
(inaudible)
which
you
maybe
very
well
familiar
and
decided
that
they
didn't
have
to
pass
upon
those
questions
at
that
time.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
no,
sir.
we're
here
on
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
ask
this
court
to
remand
the
case
of
massachusetts
with
direction
to
vacate
the
decree.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
the
final
decree
in
the
record,
sir?
on
page
317,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
if
it
were
before
--
before
the
proper
forum.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
precisely,
sir.
and
that's
--
that's
the
very
basic
case
that
under
the
doctrine
of
the
canary
case,
it
had
to
go
there
first
because
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
not
at
this
time,
sir.
it's
something
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
no,
sir,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
have
been
two
recent
decisions
of
circuit
courts
which
disagreed
with
the
board
in
their
interpretation
as
to
so-called
situs
picketing
as
to
whether
or
not
situs
picketing
as
we
had
here
at
the
railroad
yard
5
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
test
under
8
(b)
(4)
is
not
where
the
picketing
took
place
but
the
object
for
which
the
picketing
occurred.
and
there
are
still
dispute
within
that
area.
and
before
that
forum,
i
would
dispute
that
we
had
engaged
in
it
but
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
yes,
and
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
we
would
portray
our
best
expression
of
our
position,
sir,
that
we
thought
this
would
be
legal
because
it
would
be
protected
under
section
7.
so,
i
think
the
framework
of
the
--
of
the
railroad's
position
is
that
it
is
not
section
7
because
it
is
8
(b)
violation
either
by
virtue
of
bad
faith
by
new
york,
8
(b)
(4)
secondary
boycott
or
as
they
originally
accused
us
of,
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
the
jurisdictional
dispute
because
of
the
assignment
of
work
to
truck
drivers
rather
than
to
railroad
employees.
one
further
thing,
the
last
amended
substitute
complaint
which
was
before
the
trial
on
the
merits
was
based
specifically
upon
the
national
labor
relations
board
decision,
the
washington-oregon
shingle
weaver's
case
in
which
an
american
union,
united
states
union
picketed
a
united
states
company
in
order
to
force
them
to
stop
buying
a
canadian
employer
shingles
which
were
made
under
non-union
conditions.
and
in
that
case,
the
board
went
and
enjoined
that
conduct
of
the
canadian
employer.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
their
motion
was
granted,
sir,
over
our
position.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
the
one.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.the
pleadings
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
that
was
the
last
complaint
and
i
might
add
one
step
further
that
that's
not
the
first
time
that
the
union
was
accused
of
engaging
in
unfair
labor
practices
under
the
national
law.
the
original
and
the
first
amended
or
the
first
substitute
complaint
also
accused
us
of
the
same
violations.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
well,
that's
all
right,
sir
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
i
think
so,
certainly.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
and
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
i
--
i
would
say
so
and
i
think
within
the
framework
of
the
anheuser-busch
case,
this
court
has
answered
that
question.
if
it
were
a
reasonably
and
--
or
it
should
have
been
reasonably
viewed
by
the
state
court
that
this
was
within
the
area
then
that's
the
place
to
go
first,
the
national
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
--
labor
relations
board.
yes,
sir?
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir.
this
--
the
weber
case
was
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
--
last
term
--
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
yes,
sir.yes,
sir,
it
came
after
garner
but
before
anheuser-busch.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
j.
d'arcy,
jr.
i
--
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
enjoining
and
the
motion
as
--
as
my
brother
suggested
to
conform
the
pleadings
to
the
proof.
that
was
a
traditional
motion
as
i
understood
it
at
the
time
to
correct
dates,
times,
places,
names,
spelling
things
of
that
nature
which
is
why
i
get
in.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
time
he
cites
my
joining
in
into
that
motion
was
that
the
conclusion
of
a
hearing
with
respect
to
a
preliminary
injunction
and
he
even
filed
that
pleading
at
that
stage
and
that's
why
the
motion
was
joined
in
that
nature.
i
don't
think
in
any
event
that
such
a
motion
to
change
the
entire
picture
of
the
theory
of
the
case,
both
as
it
was
tried
in
massachusetts
and
as
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
determined
the
case,
mind
you
pointing
out
that
with
respect
to
the
secondary
boycott
allegations
with
respect
to
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
found
that
we
had
engaged
in
such
a
violation
with
respect
to
the
new
england
transportation
company
who
is
subject
to
the
national
act.
that's
about
all
i
have,
sir.
thank
you.
