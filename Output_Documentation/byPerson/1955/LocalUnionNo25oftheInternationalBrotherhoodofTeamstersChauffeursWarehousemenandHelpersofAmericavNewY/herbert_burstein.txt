mr.
herbert
burstein
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
case
before
this
court
does
not
involve
any
allegation
of
a
commission
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(b).
since
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
however,
has
raised
the
question,
perhaps
i
ought
to
address
myself
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
first.
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
i
understand
and
i'm
aware
of
the
statement
in
the
anheuser-busch
case
that
where
a
party
pleads
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
he
may
thereby
submit
himself
or
at
least
the
question
perhaps
should
be
one
that
should
be
resolved
by
the
court
in
the
first
instance.
i
respectfully
point
out
to
the
court
first
that
we
abandoned
all
claims
of
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
course
of
trial.
i
point
out
further,
your
honors,
that
my
pleading
at
least
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
i
say
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
it
does
this
much.
yes,
i
think
it
does
and
i
should
like
to
point
out
why,
your
honor.
your
honor
said
if
i
recall
anheuser-busch,
that
one
cannot
escape
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
by
skillful
pleading.
i
respectfully
submit
that
one
does
not
create
jurisdiction
in
the
board
by
infelicitous
pleading.
remember
that
this
case
was
tried
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
facts
demonstrate
that
there
was
no
secondary
boycott
or
other
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
were
conclusions
of
law
and
not
conclusions
of
fact.i
further
point
out
to
your
honors
that
at
the
close
of
trial,
i
move
to
amend
the
pleadings
to
conform
with
the
proof
and
that
was
done
twice.
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
page
170
and
page
296
and
counsel
for
the
union
joined
in
the
prayer
for
the
amendment
of
the
pleadings
to
conform
with
the
proof
so
that
the
case
which
came
before
the
court
did
not
in
anywise
involved
a
secondary
boycott
or
other
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.clearly,
i
cannot
and
i
do
not
create
jurisdiction
in
a
court,
in
a
federal
court
or
oust
the
state
court
by
improper
pleading
anymore
than
he
could
remove
a
case
by
an
answer
in
which
he
raises
a
federal
issue
which
does
not
actually
appear
in
the
case.
mr.
herbert
burstein
precisely
and
i
suggest
further
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
thank
you,
your
honor,
but
i
must
accept
the
responsibility
for
it.
mr.
herbert
burstein
i
did
not
but
i
must
accept
the
responsibility.
i
merely
point
out
that
there
are
dark
places
in
the
statute
which
have
not
been
flooded
with
strong
light
and
there
were
occasions
when
it
appeared
to
us
that
it
was
possible
to
allege
a
violation
of
the
act
or
an
attempt
to
procure
a
violation
and
thereby
seek
relief
in
the
state
court.
in
other
words,
an
attempt
to
produce
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
in
and
of
itself
amount
to
an
unfair
labor
practice.
under
massachusetts'
statute,
such
an
act
constitutes
a
violation
of
massachusetts'
law
and
takes
the
action
outside
the
protective
ambit
of
the
anti-injunction
law
of
massachusetts
so
that
one
might
properly
say
an
attempt
to
commit
a
--
to
procure
a
commission
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
without
necessarily
giving
jurisdiction
to
the
board
because
the
board
never
has
jurisdiction
unless
it
has
charged
that
a
violation
has
actually
occurred.
the
attempt
to
produce
a
violation
is
not
the
concomitant
or
the
equivalent
of
a
commission
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
sufficient
to
oust
the
state
court.
but
i
go
further,
your
honors,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
case
involves
only
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
union
constituted
a
protected
concerted
activity.
my
brother
has
said
in
the
courts
below,
he
has
repeated
in
his
brief
and
we
have
argued
that
there
is
no
secondary
boycott.
the
facts
here
do
not
require
the
preliminary
investigation
of
the
board.
it
does
not
require
the
expertise
of
the
board.
there
are
matters
of
law
of
which
the
state
court
under
federal
court
are
equally
competent
to
judge.
now,
there
are
three
fundamental
facts
which
i
suggest
form
a
framework
for
the
analysis
of
the
issues.
first,
since
1937,
motor
carriers
have
engaged
in
the
piggy-back
operation
my
adversary
has
described
and
the
railroad
has
made
a
very
substantial
investment
in
that
service.
since
that
day,
many,
many
railroads
invested
many
millions
of
dollars
in
precisely
the
same
form.
for
many
years
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
motor
carriers
and
the
petitioner
union
which
never
prohibited
piggy-back
operations.
and
answering
mr.
justice
reed,
new
england
transportation
is
a
motor
carrier
like
every
other
motor
carrier,
the
bulk
of
its
business
consists
in
the
transportation
of
vehicles
over
the
highway.
it
has
a
certificate
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
although
it
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
new
haven
railroad,
it
carries
on
wholly
independent
operations
including
flat
car
service.
it
is
true,
a
very
limited
portion
of
its
work
consist
in
the
riding
of
a
trailer
up
a
ramp
onto
the
flat
car.
a
various
limited
number
of
its
men
are
employed
in
that
activity.
and
i
might
point
out,
the
dispute
did
to
involve
the
driving
of
the
trailers
up
the
ramp.
the
dispute
involved
the
objective
of
the
union
to
eliminate
or
at
least
to
limit
the
transportation
of
trailers
by
flat
car.so
that
wasn't
a
dispute,
n.
e.
t.
is
not
a
--
is
not
a
secondary
employer
or
a
neutral
employer
in
this
case,
n.
e.
t.
is
a
primary
employer.
now,
the
third
and
very
vital
fact
or
one
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes.
mr.
herbert
burstein
that
is
the
alleged
primary
dispute
and
my
brother
falls
into
this
error.
he
equates
section
7
with
what
are
proper
bargainable
demands.section
7
is
a
compound
of
means
and
objectives.
what
might
be
a
perfectly
proper
objective
may
lose
the
protection
of
section
7
if
the
means
are
unlawful.
for
example,
one
may
properly
strike
for
higher
wages,
but
a
strike
in
violation
of
an
existing
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
protected
under
section
7
as
the
court
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
your
honors
approved
in
the
briggs
stratton
case.
so
that
the
dispute
--
the
objective
of
the
dispute,
the
objective
which
may
be
bargainable
and
we
don't
reach
this
issue.
and
i
dare
say
that
i
think
i
can
establish
that
any
agreement
between
the
motor
carriers
and
the
employees
to
limit
the
use
of
flatcars
might
run
a
foul
of
the
allen-bradley
principle.
it
might
be
an
elicit
arrangement
to
engage
in
a
monopoly
of
transportation,
but
i
don't
think
we
reach
that
question
because
what
is
paramount
here
is
that
the
locus
of
the
activity
was
not
primary
that
what
the
motor
carrier
employees
attempted
to
do
was
not
to
strike
the
motor
carriers
at
their
easily
accessible
terminals
in
--
in
boston,
but
they
carried
their
picket
line
to
a
secondary
situs
and
then
therein
lies
the
absence
of
protected
activity
under
section
7
(a).
now,
what
they
did
was
this,
by
establishing
a
picket
line
in
front
of
the
premises
of
the
railroad,
they
shut
down
the
railroad's
facilities,
thereby
prevented
the
railroad
from
providing
the
service,
thereby
prevented
the
motor
carriers
from
getting
the
service
and
in
that
manner,
attempted
to
resolve
their
alleged
primary
dispute
with
the
motor
carriers.
and
i
suggest
that
this
conduct
poses
this
very
important
and
unsettled
question
and
the
only
question
i
think
before
the
court
whether
employees,
having
a
dispute
with
their
employer,
are
engaged
in
a
concerted
activity
within
the
meaning
of
section
7
when
the
picketing
is
restricted
exclusively
to
the
premises
of
a
neutral
party
in
an
effort
to
force
the
neutral
party
to
cease
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer
and
in
that
attempt,
in
that
way
attempt
to
resolve
their
primary
dispute.
now,
we
contend
that
the
conduct
of
the
union
does
not
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
section
7.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
herbert
burstein
definitely
not
because
you
cannot
have
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
unless
you
again
have
a
compound
of
means
and
objects.
there
must
be
a
labor
organization
or
its
representatives
inducing
the
employees
of
an
employer
and
in
international
rice
milling,
this
court
said,
i
think
of
mr.
justice
burton's
opinion
that
that
means
a
neutral
employer
to
cease
doing
business
in
an
effort
to
force
the
primary
employer
to
come
to
terms.
there
is
no
neutral
employer
here.
there
was
no
inducement
of
railroad
employee.
there
was
no
inducement
of
any
neutral
employee
because
the
dispute
was
between
primary
employers
on
the
one
hand,
the
motor
carriers
including
new
england
transportation
and
the
labor
union
on
the
other.
so
that
there
is
no
8
(b)
(4)
involved
at
all.
mr.
herbert
burstein
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
herbert
burstein
is
there
a
distinction
between
them?
you
--
you
mean
the
new
haven
railroad
as
a
railroad
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
it
only
happens
to
be
the
--
the
owner
of
all
of
the
stock
in
new
england
transportation.
mr.
herbert
burstein
oh,
they're
completely
separate
entities
and
i
think
the
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
ownership
of
stock
--
mere
fact
of
ownership
of
stock
does
not
create
an
ally
unless
as
in
the
douds
case
cited
in
our
brief,
the
subsidiary
is
used
as
a
subcontractor
performing
our
work
but
where
there
has
been
a
long
established
parent
subsidiary
relationship,
the
board
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
independent
entity
of
the
subsidiary
company.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
new
england
transportation
is
subject
to
the
--
to
the
taft-hartley
and
i
think
everyone
will
concede,
the
new
england
--
new
haven
railroad
is
subject
to
the
railway
labor
act.
so,
they
are
separate
and
distinct
entities
and
carry
on
a
completely
different
function.
new
england
transportation
is
engaged
in
motor
carrier
operations
in
an
area
somewhat
different
from
the
area
served
by
the
new
haven
railroad.
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
burstein
i'm
sorry.
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
burstein
all
right.
i
--
i'll
answer
that.
8
(b)
(4)
is,
as
i
understand
it,
a
combination
of
means
and
objectives.
you
cannot
have
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
unless
a
labor
organization
as
defined
in
the
act
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
--
or
its
representatives
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes
--
induce
the
employees
of
an
employer.
it
says
any
employer
to
engage
in
a
concerted
refusal
in
the
course
of
their
work
to
perform
service
with
an
object
of
preventing
that
person
from
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer.
now,
in
this
instance,
there
was
no
inducement
of
railroad
employees.
no
railroad
employees
were
induced
to
stop
work,
that's
conceded,
the
record
shows
it.
no
railroad
employees
were
induced
to
stop
working.
mr.
herbert
burstein
oh,
no.
the
railroad
employees
don't
load
them.
all
they
do
is
they
fasten
it
down.
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes.
now,
you
would
then
--
your
honor
have
to
equate
new
england
transportation
company
with
a
neutral
party.
i
think
there
is
an
unfortunate
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
well,
as
i
understand
international
rice
milling
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
i
know,
but
i
think
the
court
said
in
international
rice
milling
that
a
secondary
boycott
is
accomplished
only
when
there
is
inducement
of
employees
of
neutral
employer
to
engage
in
a
concerted
refusal
because
your
honor
will
recall
that
the
inducement
of
two
individual
employees
was
held
not
to
constitute
a
secondary
boycott.
mr.
herbert
burstein
because
new
england
is
a
primary
employer.
there
was
as
much
a
dispute
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
oh,
no,
new
england
was
very
much
in
the
conflict
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
apart
from
that
it
also
engages
in
a
service,
no
differently
than
the
others.
the
object
was
not
to
prevent
new
england.
the
object
was
not
to
prevent
the
loading
of
the
trailers
on
the
flatcars
once
they
came
into
the
yard.
the
object
was
to
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
not
--
to
limit
--
to
limit
the
number
that
could
come
into
the
yard.
mr.
herbert
burstein
it
may
have
been
an
--
a
technique
but
it
was
not
the
object
because
8
(b)
(4)
requires
that
an
object
be
the
cessation
of
employment.
in
the
douds
against
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
your
honor,
i
have
--
i
defer
to
your
superior
analysis
of
the
case.
i
read
it
a
number
of
times.
i
respectfully
submit
that
rice
milling
says
that
you
do
not
have
a
secondary
boycott
unless
there
is
the
inducement
of
employees
of
a
neutral
employer.
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
i
know.
mr.
herbert
burstein
if
there
is
every
inducement
of
a
strike,
even
a
primary
one
has
incidental
secondary
effects.
there
are
perfectly
permissible
secondary
effects.
for
example,
the
inducement
by
a
union
to
the
employees
of
an
employer
under
contract
to
cease
work
may
have
an
incidental
secondary
effect.
mr.
herbert
burstein
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
this
case
poses
that
issue.
i
think
that
issue
has
been
suggested
here,
but
i
don't
believe
--
i
do
not
believe
that
merely
because
conduct
in
the
labor
field
may
conceivably
lie
within
the
competence
of
the
board
that
the
state
board
is
per
se
ousted
of
jurisdiction.
if
the
facts
on
their
phase
disclose
that
there
has
no
violation
of
the
law,
a
court
is
competent
to
find
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
is
no
violation.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
is
merely
initial
primary
that
presupposes
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
an
administrative
agency
and
a
court.
this
isn't
an
instance
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
where
i
have
instituted
a
proceeding
and
then
go
into
the
court
to
get
relief,
where
i
have
improperly
timed
my
relief.
i
suggest
that
on
the
phase
of
my
papers
and
the
facts
before
this
court
as
they
were
developed
in
the
record,
this
court
could
conclude
that
there
was
no
secondary
boycott.
mr.
herbert
burstein
or
--
or
under
aircraft
&
diesel
versus
hirsch
that
an
application
to
the
court
would
have
been
--
would
have
been
futile
and
the
damage
irreparable
because
as
i
understand
the
case,
your
honors
there
said
that
one
need
not
resort
to
an
agency
where
an
application
would
be
futile
and
there
would
be
irreparable
harm.
but
i
suggest
further
even
if
the
board
is
wrong
in
international
rice
milling,
even
if
the
board
has
changed
its
policy
and
will
take
jurisdiction
of
a
case
involving
a
railroad,
i
suggest
that
the
legislators
never
intended
that
railroads
be
subject
to
any
part
of
the
benefits
or
the
restrictions
of
the
act,
and
i
should
like
to
take
10
minutes
to
develop
that.
i
should
like
to
summarily
state
with
your
honors'
permission
that
where
activity
is
withdrawn
from
the
primary
area
of
dispute
and
transferred
exclusively
to
a
secondary
locus,
you
have
secondary
activity
which
was
not
intended
to
be
protected
under
section
7.
in
this
case
you
also
have
a
question
of
partial
strikes,
intermittent
strikes,
a
strike
and
violation
of
on
agreement.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
this
is
not
a
protected
activity,
the
sands
case
and
so
on
down
the
line.
furthermore,
if
the
argument
which
is
advanced
that
an
act
not
prohibited
by
8
(b)
(4)
is
a
fortiori
protected
by
7
is
adopted,
then
it
means
that
the
very
thing
that
concerted
activities
has
intended
to
produce,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
may
be
broken
with
impunity
and
the
parties
engaged
in
the
breach
of
the
contract
are
protected
under
section
7
(a).
such
a
construction
would
be
obviously
self-defeating,
i
think
there's
no
question
that
this
activity
was
not
primary,
and
i
think
the
only
question
which
is
open
for
discussion
is
the
question
your
honor
has
raised.
i'm
concerned
with
it.
mr.
herbert
burstein
right.
i
might
say,
your
honor,
that
litigants
sometimes
educate
each
other.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
was
not
mr.
d'arcy's
case.
i
think
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
i
am
entitled
to
treat
as
a
pleading
and
the
question
which
has
certified
mr.
d'arcy's
case
is
pitched
entirely
on
the
claim
that
they
were
engaged
in
a
primary
protected
activity.
i
respectfully
submit
that's
the
only
question
i
am
obliged
to
answer
here.
when
the
case
comes
up
involving
questions
of
8
(b)
(4)
then
i
think
i'll
answer
that,
but
i
shall
just
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
the
railroad's
position.
section
2,
which
contains
the
definitions,
expressly
excludes
a
railroad
as
an
employer.
section
2,
i
think
its
subdivision
3
which
defines
employees
similarly
and
by
express
language
excludes
employees
employed
by
a
railroad.now,
this
is
interesting
to
observe.
under
the
original
wagner
act,
the
railroads
were
expressly
excluded
from
the
definition
of
employer.
when
the
wagner
act
was
amended,
congress
in
order
to
avoid
the
remote
and
improbable
possibility
that
railroad
employees
might
be
embraced
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
specifically
wrote
into
the
law
the
definition
of
employees,
the
language
not
to
include
employee
subject
to
the
--
to
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
under
the
wagner
act,
the
board
never
assumed
jurisdiction
over
railroads
or
railroad
employees
and
there's
a
good
reason
for
it.
the
railway
labor
act
is
one
of
longer
standing
than
the
wagner
act
that
it
proved
a
salutary
piece
of
legislation.
it
too
has
an
administrative
machinery
to
test
collective
bargaining
agreement
certification
and
indeed
in
case
of
national
strikes
and
emergencies.
congress
never
thought
it
necessary
to
set
up
a
procedure
for
dealing
with
secondary
boycotts.
why?
because
the
railroads
have
traditionally
been
accorded
special
statutory
treatment,
the
railroads
were
not
under
the
same
restrictions
and
inhibitions
as
most
businessman
and
were
able
to
get
relief
from
the
state
courts.
now,
we
have
to
conclude
that
congress
secretly
and
by
implication
intended
to
cover
railroads
and
your
honor
said
in
one
of
your
opinion,
if
one
cannot
see
the
plain
meaning
in
a
statute
and
surely
the
statute
is
not
clear,
it
is
full
of
dark
places,
i
respectfully
submit
that,
then
one
looks
to
the
legislative
history.
and
the
debates
on
the
house
and
the
debates
in
the
senate
demonstrate
inclusively
that
the
act
was
never
intended
to
be
applied
to
railroads
at
all.
i
think
senator
taft,
in
response
to
a
question
put
to
him
by
senator
morse
at
the
time
said,
"of
course
not,
railroad
labor
is
always
been
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
we
don't
intend
to
cover
it
under
the
8
(b)
violation
which
included
the
cause
of
that.”
now,
there's
one
other
clue
which
is
i
think
very
significant,
in
order
to
bring
the
railroads
within
the
framework
of
this
act,
one
must
have
a
piecemeal
application,
one
must
assume
that
congress
not
only
was
unsophisticated,
it
was
irrational
because
there
are
at
least
five
instances
in
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
apply
this
act
to
railroads
and
a
railroad
would
be
a
direct
dictum
of
the
secondary
boycott
and
have
no
remedy,
not
before
the
board
and
not
in
the
court
perhaps.
for
example,
if
a
railroad
union
were
to
induce
railroad
employees
to
engage
in
a
strike
for
prohibited
objects
as
defined
in
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
you
could
not
have
a
secondary
boycott
by
definition
because
a
railroad
union
is
not
a
labor
organization
under
the
act.
contrary
wise
and
despite
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
if
there
was
an
inducement
of
employees
of
a
railroad
to
engage
in
a
strike,
you
could
not
have
it
because
the
employees
of
a
railroad
are
not
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
law.
you
cannot
have
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(d)
because
there
you
will
trench
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
the
assignment
of
work
which
is
the
end-product
of
a
proceeding
in
8
(b)
(d),
where
the
board
says
there's
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
i
assign
the
work
to
union
a,
is
manifestly
impossible
because
that
kind
of
an
adjudication
can
only
be
made
by
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
now,
how
then
is
a
railroad
brought
within
the
compass
of
this
act?
in
one
situation,
the
board
in
the
international
rice
milling
said,
first,
when
congress
said
the
employees
of
any
employer
in
the
a
part
of
8
(b)
(4),
it
meant
any
employer
irrespective
of
the
definition,
then
that's
an
absurdity
because
section
10
which
deals
with
the
prevention
of
unfair
labor
practices
says
that
when
any
person
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice
as
defined
in
section
158,
a
charge
may
be
filed.
well,
any
person
can
include
a
railroad
there
because
a
railroad
can
never
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(a)
which
is
the
employer
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
when
the
unfair
labor
practices
were
included
for
union,
railroad
unions
were
expressly
excluded
just
as
railroad
employers
were
excluded
from
section
8,
the
employer
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
in
this
one
remote
case,
where
a
railroad
is
a
victim
of
a
secondary
boycott,
it
is
suggested
that
the
railroad
must
then
pursue
the
remedies
before
the
board
because
in
all
other
cases
its
position
is
worse,
not
better,
but
worse
than
every
other
employer
because
you
can
never
be
the
victim
of
a
direct
secondary
boycott.
now,
this
would
be
a
foolish
way
to
write
a
statute.
it
would
not
only
be
bad
draftsmanship,
it
would
be
impossible
of
application
and
construction.
it
would
mean,
as
i've
said
in
my
brief,
that
you'd
have
two
acts
like
tenancy
in
common
jointly
occupying
one
field.
there
is
no
such
doctrine
of
preemption.
now,
i
confess
to
some
difficulty,
i've
had
considerable
difficulty.
and
the
difficulty
is
this,
it
may
well
be
that
there
is
a
remedy
in
the
board
when
the
railroad
is
a
victim
of
a
secondary
boycott
as
it
may
have
been
in
this
case
conceivably,
it
may
have
a
remedy
in
the
board.
i
suggest
that
the
doctrine
of
preemption
does
not
grow
out
of
the
existence
of
a
remedy,
it
grows
out
of
language
which
expressly
says
we
occupy
the
entire
field
or
there's
a
congressional
intention
to
occupy
the
entire
field.
now,
it's
true
perhaps
that
the
railroad
could
have
filed
a
charge.
it
is
also
true
that
the
united
states
of
america
can
file
a
charge
but
would
anyone
suggest
that
the
united
states
of
america,
in
order
to
protect
itself
from
a
secondary
boycott,
must
file
a
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
board
said
no
in
surprise
and
made
a
very
silly
distinction.
they
said
it
was
based
on
the
word
person.
but
in
the
sherman
act,
in
the
maritime
act,
in
a
host
of
other
regulatory
statutes,
the
word
"person"
has
been
construed
to
apply
to
united
states
government.
i
suggest
that
an
interpretation
which
would
require
a
railroad
to
go
to
the
labor
board
in
the
one
instance
would
make
this
candidly
as
this
law
incapable
of
application.
i
suggest
that
the
intention
of
the
congress
in
enacting
the
taft-hartley
was
not
to
bring
railroads
within
the
compass
of
the
act
or
to
make
it
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
i
suggest
that
congress
intended
at
all
times
that
where
a
railroad
was
impeded
in
the
performance
of
its
common
carrier
duties,
the
railroad
could
have
recourse
to
the
court
and
many
district
courts
have
so
held.
mr.
herbert
burstein
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
burstein
no,
it
can't
but
it
will
go
to
a
federal
court
because
there
may
not
be
a
labor
dispute
and
therefore
the
inhibitions
of
the
norris-laguardia
won't
apply.
mr.
herbert
burstein
on
diversity,
yes.
i
agree,
on
diversity.
mr.
herbert
burstein
this
one?
mr.
herbert
burstein
this
particular
case?
mr.
herbert
burstein
i
don't
follow
your
honor.
i'm
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
i
think
so.
i
think
there's
no
labor
dispute
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
a
very
interesting
question.
i
think
it
was
adjudicated
in
the
erie
railroad
case
which
i
cite
in
my
--
my
brief.i
suggest
in
any
event,
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
a
remedy
and
here
is
where
i've
have
had
my
difficulty,
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
be
a
remedy
in
this
rare
case
where
the
railroad
is
a
remote
victim
of
the
activity
of
a
union
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board,
does
not
preclude
the
railroad
from
going
into
a
state
court
anymore
than
the
united
states
government,
if
it
need
to
prosecute
a
matter
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
in
many
instances
able
to
pursue
its
remedies
in
the
state
or
federal
court.
mr.
herbert
burstein
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
yes,
i
think
anheuser-busch
doesn't
mean
that
in
every
case
in
which
there
is
an
allegation
of
possible
embracing
of
the
activity
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statute,
you
must
send
it
back
to
the
board
for
determination.
i
don't
think
that
this
kind
of
a
case
particularly
calls
for
the
technical
knowledge,
the
skill,
the
expertise
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
i
suggest
further,
anheuser-busch
did
one
more
thing,
it
pointed
out
that
the
garner
case
--
the
dictum
in
garner
case
suggested
by
the
late
justice
jackson
that
wherever
interstate
commerce
was
involved,
you
necessarily
had
preemption.
it's
suggested
by
the
three
categories
of
cases
that
if
the
matter
was
not
covered
by
the
act
or
protected,
not
prohibited,
then
the
state
would
be
free
to
act.
now,
i
submit
that
a
state
court
is
competent
to
decide,
to
give
an
action
in
the
light
of
the
persistent
denials,
remember
that
my
pleadings
weren't
the
only
papers
before
the
court,
my
very
able
adversary
not
only
denied
the
allegation,
the
conclusory
allegation
but
he
joined
in
my
motion
to
conform
the
pleadings
to
the
proof.
the
proof
never
established
a
secondary
boycott
and
the
mere
fact
that
i
plead
badly,
the
mere
fact
i
asked
for
relief
i'm
not
entitled
to
does
not
bind
a
court
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
as
educed.
mr.
herbert
burstein
this
is
very
interesting,
judge
wyzanksi,
i
--
i
didn't
handle
that
complaint
either
because
i
thought
it
was
a
bad
complaint.
a
complaint
was
filed
in
a
federal
court
and
judge
wyzanski
said,
"oh,
i
can't
give
you
relief
under
the
labor
management
act
because
a
railroad
is
not
an
employer."
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
complaint
was
bad
for
other
reasons
but
in
any
event
judge
wyzanski
did
suggest
that
we
could
not
claim
relief
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
because
the
railroad
is
not
an
employer.
and
i
think
it's
cited
in
my
brother's
statement
to
the
court.
i
might
point
out
too
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
he
did
not,
it
was
--
mr.
herbert
burstein
--
oral
opinion,
yes.
i
might
point
out
too
that
in
my
statement
to
the
court,
in
the
opening
statement
i
made
to
the
court
and
i
should
like
to
point
out
this
--
i
think
i've
got
one
minute
left.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
in
my
opening
statement
to
the
court
which
appears
on
--
on
page
39,
i
said,
"now,
this
is
a
case
which
does
not
involve
a
secondary
boycott
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)."
we
started
with
that.
i
confess
that
from
time
to
time
amendments
were
made
to
the
pleadings
but
they
were
conclusions
of
law.
they
were
abandoned
in
the
course
of
trial.
we
moved
to
conform
the
pleadings
to
the
proof,
the
only
case
before
the
court
and
the
only
case
that
was
brought
to
this
court
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
whether
this
activity
was
protected
and
therefore
the
state
court
was
ousted
of
jurisdiction.
i
respectfully
conclude
by
saying
that
i
do
not
believe
these
activities
were
concerted
nor
protected
under
section
7
and
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
your
honor.
