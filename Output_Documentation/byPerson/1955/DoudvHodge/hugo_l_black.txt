are
there
any
facts
that
would
have
to
be
added
to
what's
been
done
in
all
for
the
constitutional
questions
to
be
read
or
as
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
might
--
they
might
uphold
it
just
for
three
years,
it
might
be
the
supreme
court
--
court
of
illinois
would
have
decided
on
it.
justice

l.

i'm
thinking
the
magnolia
petroleum
case,
we
held
our
direction
to
hold
it
under
(inaudible)
they
could
an
action,
they
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
engaging
in
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
there's
no
reason
so
far
as
illinois
is
to
serve
an
apportionment
law
is
--
it
should
exercise
the
power
if
we
have
exercised
it
in
the
constitution
base
on
the
case
for
that
same
effect.‚Äù
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
reason
that
you
advance
by
illinois
with
the
inference
on
why
the
--
the
laws
should
be
thrown
if
the
court
should
bring
about
whatever
delay
it
might
be
necessary
and
sent
it
back
to
be
tried
first
by
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
this
law
that
has
to
be
--
has
any
bearing
on
that?
