suppose
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
should,
under
the
separability
clause
of
this
act
say,
if
the
exemption
is
--
would
then
be
--
be
alright?
you
and
i,
the
plaintiff,
work
it
out.
suppose
they
say
the
exception
clause
and
only
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
say
that.
well,
this
court
has
held
the
question
of
whether
the
state
statute
may
be
saved
by
cutting
out
or
challenge
the
provision
of
the
question
from
the
state
court,
not
with
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
take
that
for
a
state
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
what
case
that
we
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
some
like
business.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
like
reasonable
judicial
administration
even
to
--
and
cite
a
case
because
that
for
the
federal
judiciary
to
tell
a
state,
whether
a
statute
can
stand
by
cutting
out
some
offending
position,
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
was
asked,
then
you
say
illinois
has
already
said
that
that
provision
is
bad,
the
whole
must
fall.
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
--
if
the
suggestion
that
after
the
mcdougall
case
decided
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
that
--
that
was
decided
in
january
17,
1945
and
after
that
decision,
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
wisconsin
district
court
was
rendered,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
knowledge
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
and
the
suggestion
is
that
since
the
exception
clause
that
it
seems
to
be
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
that
are
now
has
an
element,
wasn't
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
at
the
time
of
the
refusal
to
take
and
confronted
with
determination
by
a
federal
court
that
that
violates
the
equal
protection
clause,
they
may
now
change
their
minds,
they
were
–
actually,
the
federal
authority
stood
about
it,
we
will
never
let
–
never
let
that
the
statute
stand.
what
about
that,
isn't
that
the
suggestion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
as
it
were,
therefore
as
it
were,
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
not
ruled
out
the
merits
that
he
is
not
a
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
can't,
i
suggest
the
confidence
that
i
didn't
know
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
is
abstract
person?
what
was
his
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
represented
somebody.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he's
just
as
--
just
an
individual
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposing
no
interest
except
interest
in
the
law,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
anything
outside
the
record.
i
just
wondered
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
conclusion
of
lawsuits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
conclusion
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
did
an
annual
jurisdiction
and
if
they
find
the
fact
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
is
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
that
--
that
what
the
law
indicated,
what
the
merits
are,
and
what
is
before
us,
what
they've
given
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
didn't
state
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
that's
your
answer
and
that
is
the
answer
that
should
have
been
made,
but
there's
a
certain
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
the
question
of
--
of
the
freedom
of
illinois,
on
the
exercise
by
illinois,
touch
this
question
and
may
or
may
not
have
had
under
that,
in
the
constitution
or
the
fourteenth
amendment,
make
an
exception
to
the
american
express
company.
and
that
you
stated
all
in
the
record,
one
would
have
to
go
through
the
record
to
see
what
justification
there
is
for
that
if
any
out
of
a
clear
sky,
something
that
helps
me
to
say
that
it
couldn't
have
made
such
an
exception.
i'm
not
saying
it
could.
i'm
not
saying
it
wouldn't
be
on
the
denial
of
equal
protection.
i'm
saying
that
on
the
phase,
if
i
know
no
more
than
i
now,
just
on
the
phase
of
it,
i
have
to
attribute
to
illinois
some
good
reasons
for
the
exception
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
i
will
have
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
only
way
to
not
let
that
general,
that
abstract
attribution
of
u.s.
2003
follow
up
illinois
to
prevail,
would
be
to
go
through
this
whole
business
and
maybe
more,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
attention
to
findings
of
fact
by
the
court
that
this
has
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
and
make
findings
of
fact.
i
can't
because
i
don't
think
that's
proper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
it
has
no
jurisdiction
and
then
you
say,
tells
you
what
i
already
knew.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
jurisdiction,
would
have
jurisdiction
for
me,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
arguing
the
merits
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
maybe
--
what
about
the
unfairness
of
letting
uncle
sam
issue
these?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
it
may
by
--
by
an
existence
of
that
fact
between
a
denial
of
equal
protection
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't
regulate
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
thing
--
that
is
--
i'm
not
saying
that
that
is
--
wouldn't
if
he
enter
an
affidavit,
to
be
something
that
illinois
couldn't
do
it
because
this
--
denied
equal
protection.
i'm
saying
that
that
isn't
the
question
here
unless
not
efficiently,
we
can
clear
the
matter
of
course,
you
don't
have
to
have
any
rights.
but
of
course,
they
didn't
see
what
american
express
--
i
don't
think
it's
in
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
on
this
record
because
the
court
below
said
we
can't
consider
it
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
question
under
that
--
that
court
to
decide
that
question
didn't
you
and
they
say
to
which
they
had
passed
on?
now,
you're
arguing
the
alternative
either
that
they
did
pass
on
it,
but
they
say
they
couldn't
or
there's
enough
in
this
record
for
me
now
to
make
up
--
make
up
my
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
have
brought
that
question
here
as
an
original
act,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
and
i
has
meet
(inaudible)
to
because
the
district
court
refused
to
consider
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wine,
please
forgive
me
to
interrupt
you
in
asking
you,
what
declarative
order
to
meet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
reclaim
power
is
vague
by
waiting
to
see
what
illinois
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
threw
it
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
couldn't
--
can
handle
this
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
defending
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
at
this
moment
and
based
to
what
you
have
indicated,
the
court
would
have
to
remit
it
or
remand
to
the
district
court,
tell
him
to
be
ceased
of
jurisdiction
directing
the
district
court
to
assert
jurisdiction
which
is
now
disavowed
and
having
a
sense
of
jurisdiction
to
this
fourteenth
amendment
of
a
judicial
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
have
to
go
through
that
form
because
this
court
can't
enter
10
cases
as
now
in
all
three,
he
--
he
entered
this
kind
of
a
judgement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
here
in
the
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
to
be
that
the
district
court,
the
northern
district,
they
will
hold
this
case
and
subject
to
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
because
clearly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
this
court
meant,
the
district
courts
had
jurisdiction
for
mentioning
the
other
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
those
cases,
i
have
said
about
the
other
conclusions
and
certainly
held
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
does
it?
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
that
they
said
it
has
a
jurisdiction
attributing
it.
i
should
like
to
go
over
it
as
your
facts
--
i
think
i
should
that
present
this
noble
case,
how
can
you
(inaudible)
in
this
langugation
particularly,
this
character
in
a
case
like
this.
saying
that
even
if
--
if
this
is
--
if
this
is
involved
maybe,
the
question
of
public
law
separability.
we
think
federal
forum
is
not
an
appropriate
forum.
you
can
get
all
you
want
by
going
to
the
court
and
say
you
don't
get
what
you
want
in
both
the
supreme
court
in
the
united
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore,
this
is
civil
intermediary
set.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
got
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
he
has
power
including
the
appropriate
relationship
in
federal
and
state
court,
we
don't
think
he
should
exercise
it.
and
what
you're
doing
is
to
reading
this
disposition
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
point
of
--
what
is
the
point
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

are
you
arguing
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
jurisdictional
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
have
an
effect
that
says
error
in
respect
to
both
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
that
this
is
a
case
for
which
the
state
court
might
divulge
that
the
exception
has
been
cut
out,
and
therefore,
that
rule
speculate
the
things,
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
you
going
to
argue
that
--
that
the
exemption
is
a
proper
one,
it's
not
--
it
doesn't
offend
the
equal
protection
clause,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
when
are
you
coming?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
--
to
what
--
to
what
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

can
make
that
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
unclean
hands?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
your
--
and
this
court
knows
that
but
you
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
it
exists,
the
court
order
to
look
into
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
to
mean
to
shut
anybody
off,
i
--
just
that
exemption
to
allege
into
the
(inaudible)
whether
his
argument
were
irrelevant
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wines.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
confident
with
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
a
very
experienced
lawyer
insofar
as
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
motion
to
affirm,
you
say
10
reasons
why
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
the
only
--
the
only
one
of
the
10
reasons
that
comes
within
1000
miles
of
what
you're
now
arguing
is
–
is
a
defense
of
unclean
hands
was
raised
and
that's
the
question
whether
the
hands
are
clean
or
unclean
in
order
to
(inaudible)
even
the
local
questions.
and
i
want
to
argue
and
ask
this
forum
on
the
merits,
defense
on
whether
or
not
this
defense
is
good
or
bad,
whether
the
argument
(inaudible)
material
in
the
state
underlying,
take
out
what
you
say
(inaudible).
and
i
call
it
the
most
irregular
and
inadmissible
way
of
dealing
with
litigation
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
we
come
in
--
i'm
not
saying
it's
improper.
i'm
saying
it's
not
the
way
cases
should
be
argued
to
this
court
with
all
the
modern
freedom
of
argument
from
--
from
the
(inaudible)
intermission
that
was
joined
on
jurisdiction,
and
we're
asked
to
pass
on
the
1001
questions
that
haven't
been
passed
on
by
the
lower
court,
do
not
appear
in
the
brief
or
any
appeals
before
this
court
and
those
are
the
reply.
there's
no
pleading
procedure,
practice
relevant
all
goes
by
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
raise
--
you
couldn't
say
this
should
be
affirmed
because
of
the
face
of
the
--
this
fellow
comes
in
with
unclean
hands.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
your
brief.
i'm
talking
about
your
motion
to
affirm,
10
arguments
you
gave,
why
we
shouldn't
take
those?
what
do
they
want
if
there
was
an
issue
of
unclean
hands
which
ought
to
be
left
with
a
local
tribunal
and
want
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
pass
on
this
necessarily
argumentative
conflict,
de
novo,
original?
i
don't
call
that
--
i
don't
call
that
referring
to
the
business,
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
other
than
this,
that's
my
view,
and
very
strongly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
contesting
that.
i'm
not
passing.
i'm
not
having
anything.
my
mind
was
to
the
direction
on
this.
when
you
asked
us
not
to
take
the
case,
that
wasn't
one
of
the
ground
you
took
and
i
say
it's
not
for
the
likelihood
to
free
my
mind
to
bear
on
something
that
the
district
court
if
anybody
should
pass.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
thought
your
experience
is
(inaudible)
to
know
in
mind
to
this
kind
of
case
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
--
i
didn't
use
the
word
“improper.”
i
was
very
careful
not
to
use
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
here
witnesses
on
the
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
issue
wasn't
going
into
by
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we'll
have
original
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
really
challenging
that
part
of
it.
you
didn't
assume
the
judgment
on
any
ground
who
gave
10
grounds
in
your
motion
to
affirm
that
this
wasn't
one
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
has
--
who
can
conduct
the
express
company
case
with
the
united
states,
the
whole
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

were
express
companies,
an
absolute
monopoly
by
act
of
congress.
justice
felix

is
that
all
right?
justice
felix

that's
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
money
order
isn't
all
wrong.
