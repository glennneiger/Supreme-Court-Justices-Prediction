is

an
order
of
the
three-judge
district

in
the
northern

dismissing
for
one
of
federal
jurisdiction,
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the

on
the
ground
that
it
is
repugnant
to
the
equal
rights
such
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
material
allegations
of
the
amended
complaint,
which
were
supported
by
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
or
–
or
admitted
in
the
answer
to
include
to
following.
that
the
action
of
course
arises
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
1,
that
the
amount
in
controversy,
which
this
court
said
in
the
gibbs
case
in
307
u.s.
which
is
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief,
is
the
value
of
the
right
to
conduct
the
business
prohibited
by
the
challenged
statute,
exceed
the
sum
of
$3000
exclusive
of
interest
and
cost.
and
the
plaintiffs,
doud,
mcdonald
and
carlson,
constitute
a
partnership
doing
business
under
the
foreign
name
of
bondified
systems,
that
the
defendant
--
that
they're
all
citizens
of
illinois,
that
the
defendant
hodge
is
a
duly
qualified
and
acting
auditor
of
public
accounts
of
the
state
of
illinois.
the
defendant,
latham
castle
is
a
duly
qualified
and
acting
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
illinois,
and
the
defendant,
gutknecht
as
a
duly
qualified
an
acting
state's
attorney
of
cook
county,
resided
in
that
county
in
the
northern
district.
that's
submitted
on
the
action.
that
the
partnership
is
organized
for
the
purpose
of,
intends
to
engage
and
has
been
engaged
not
in
the
ordinary
business
of
a
currency
exchange,
but
exclusively
in
the
business
of
selling
and
issuing
money
orders
under
the
firm
name,
“bondified
systems”
in
cook
and
other
counties
in
the
state
of
illinois.
that
is
supported
by
finding
three,
page
509
of
the
record.
then,
follows
a
great
deal
detail
as
to
how
the
plaintiffs
came
to
get
a
license
to
sell
this
--
this
particular
kind
of
money
orders
and
how
they
happen
to
operate
as
a
partnership
and
not
as
a
corporation.
and
then,
at
page
13
of
the
record
is
the
allegation
as
to
the
provisions
of
the
statute
involved,
which
the
statute
of
course
is
submitted
in
the
answer,
page
27
of
the
record.
the
act
is
an
act
in
relation
to
the
definition,
the
regulation
and
licensing
of
community
currency
exchanges.
it's
also
ambulatory,
so-called
ambulatory
currency
exchanges
which
are
not
here
involved.
the
statute
purports
to
regulate
the
business
--
i'm
reading
from
the
amended
complaint,
purports
to
regulate
the
business
of
a
community
currency
exchange
which
is
defined
to
be,
one,
a
person,
firm
or
a
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
providing
facilities
or
cashing
checks,
drafts
and
money
orders
for
a
fee
or
service
charge
or
other
consideration
or,
two,
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
or
issuing
money
orders
in
his,
there
or
its
name
or
any
other
money
orders
or,
the
third
classification,
engaged
in
both
such
businesses
subject
to
certain
exceptions.
at
page
14
of
the
record,
the
complaint
--
the
amended
complaint
further
alleges,
“the
statute
likewise
specifically
exempts
from
a
definition”
--
i
should
say
at
first
it
exempts
state
and
national
banks.
the
statute
likewise
specifically
exempt
from
the
definition
of
a
community
currency
exchanged,
all
persons,
firms
and
corporations
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
or
issuing
united
states
post
office
money
orders,
american
express
company
money
orders,
postal
telegraph
company
money
orders,
understand
those
two
are
now
merged
or
western
union
telegraph
company
money
orders.
in
other
words,
the
exemption
is
not
only
the
post
office,
united
states
post
office
which
is,
of
course,
a
federal
instrumentality,
the
western
union
telegraph
company
which
is
regulated
by
federal
law,
and
also
the
american
express
company
money
orders,
which
is
not
subject
to
any
regulations
whatsoever.
the
said
statute
contains
the
following
provisions,
regulating
the
business
of
the
community
currency
exchange,
no
person,
firm
or
corporation
which
is
not
exempted
from
the
definition
of
a
community
currency
exchange
shall
engage
in
the
business
of
selling
or
issuing
money
orders
without
first
securing
a
license
to
do
so
from
the
auditor
public
accounts
of
the
state
of
illinois.
the
said
statute
further
provides
that
a
community
currency
exchange
shall
not
be
conducted
as
a
department
of
another
business
that
it
must
be
an
entity,
financed,
and
conducted
as
a
separate
business
unit.
it
is
then
alleged
that
this
classification
is
unconstitutionally
broad
in
that,
one,
the
american
express
company
operates
its
money
order
business
in
substantially
the
same
manner
in
which
said
plaintiffs
operate.
that
is
supported
by
the
court's
finding
of
fact.
two,
there's
a
conclusion
that
the
exemption
of
the
american
express
money
orders
is
unwanted,
not
germane
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
highly
discriminatory.
then
the
allegation
that
the
american
express
company
is
an
aggregation
of
individuals
operating
under
a
joint
stock
company
plan.
it
is
not
a
corporation
but
an
association
of
individuals.
that's
submitted
in
the
action.
the
answer
also
admits
that
the
american
express
company
sells
and
issues
money
orders
in
the
city
of
chicago,
illinois
through
operators
of
drug
and
grocery
stores,
such
operators
retaining
a
portion
of
a
fee
fixed
by
the
american
express
company
for
the
issuance
of
its
money
orders.
that
is
submitted
in
the
answer.
the
answer
also,
admits
that
no
statutes
in
the
state
of
illinois
provide
for
any
regulation
by
any
law,
a
board
commission
or
a
regulatory
body
of
the
operations
of
the
american
express
company
in
illinois.
it's
also
admitted
in
the
answer,
the
american
express
company
does
not
operate
under
any
franchise,
granted
to
the
state
of
illinois
and
said,
"american
express
company
is
not
subject
to
regulation
by
any
regulatory
body
from
the
state
of
illinois,
and
the
american
express
company
agencies
in
issuing
money
orders
are
in
direct
competition
where
the
operations
by
the
said
plaintiffs.”
that's
supported
by
the
court's
finding
of
fact.
there
is
then
this
allegation.
the
defendant
--
this
is
at
page
18.
the
defendant
orville
hodge,
auditor
of
public
accounts
of
the
state
of
illinois,
the
defendant,
latham
castle,
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
illinois,
and
the
defendant,
john
gutknecht,
states
attorney
of
cook
county,
illinois
have
threatened
that
any
attempt
by
plaintiffs
to
operate
the
business
of
selling
and
issuing
money
orders
under
their
firm
name,
either
through
offices
wholly
owned
and
operated
by
them
or
by
means
of
operators
of
drug,
hardware
and
grocery
stores
as
agents
of
the
plaintiffs
or
by
both
such
means
will
bring
down
upon
plaintiffs
action
by
said
defendants
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
illinois
to
prevent
such
continuance
of
such
business
and
for
the
enforcement
of
the
provisions
of
state
of
illinois,
community
currency
exchanged
act
by
criminal
prosecution.
that,
at
page
29
of
the
record,
is
this
admission
and
the
answer.
they
admit
they
threatened
to
enforce
the
said
statute
against
the
plaintiffs,
if
the
latter
violated
the
same,
but
alleged
that
said
threats
were
general
and
specifically,
and
not
specifically
directed
against
any
particular
conduct
of
the
plaintiffs.
that
at
the
time
they
made
said
threats,
the
plaintiffs
have
either
not
violated
the
said
statute
or
these
defendants
were
not
apprised
of
any
violation.
that
these
defendants
were
not
informed
of
any
such
violations
until
the
amended
complaint
informed
them
of
the
same.
that
these
defendants
have
thus
far,
taken
no
legal
steps
against
the
plaintiffs
to
enforce
the
said
statute,
and
since
this
suit
has
been
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court,
no
proceeding
has
been
brought
in
the
state
courts.
the
state
courts
have
not
now
required
no
jurisdiction
over
the
matter.
now,
that's
the
first
count.
that's
by
the
three
plaintiffs
constituting
this
partnership.
they're
the
ones
that
alleged
that
they
have
this
license
from
the
people
who
have
copyrighted
and
have
certain
forms
that
they
sell
for
the
purpose
of
selling
this
money
orders,
a
system
of
making
reports
and
--
and
keeping
records
etcetera.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
at
this
moment,
it
is
not,
your
honor,
but
it
was
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed
and
for
some
little
time
after.
that
was
one
agent
in
illinois.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
justiciable
controversy,
it
wasn't
just
someone
saying
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
--
“we
like
to
do
it
and
will
you
please
tell
us
whether
we
can
do
it
or
not,
the
case,
we
should
go
ahead
and
do
it.”
the
second
count,
the
plaintiff
is
--
now,
mr.
derrick,
the
plaintiff,
derrick
who
alleges,
readopts
all
the
allegations
of
the
first
count
and
he
alleges
that
he
has
--
is
now
operating
and
has
for
many
years
operate
the
drug
store
at
whitten,
illinois.
and
that
he
obtained
a
lot
sublicense
from
the
other
plaintiffs.
and
as
soon
as
he
obtain
that
sublicense,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
auditor
of
public
accounts,
defendant
auditor
who
is
the
administrative
in
charged
of
the
enforcement
of
the
act,
and
he
told
the
auditor
in
his
letter,
this
is
submitted
and
the
letter
is
an
exhibit
of
the
record,
“that
i
have
got
this
sublicense
to
sell
these
money
orders
in
my
drug
store,
and
i
understand
that
this
statute
would
prohibit
that,
and
i
think
that
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
deprives
me
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
under
the
united
states
constitution.
and
as
soon
as
i
get
my
supplies,
therefore,
i'm
going
to
proceed
to
sell
these
money
orders
in
my
drug
store,
just
like
i
used
to
sell
american
express
money
orders
in
my
drug
store.
we
didn't
have
to
have
a
licence
because
statute
didn't
apply
to
me
then.”
and
the
evidence
is
clear,
i
know
i
think
it's
submitted
here
that
he
did
proceed
to
sell
them.
a
number
of
the
money
orders
that
he
actually
sold
are
in
the
record.
now,
those
are
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaint
that
are
either
admitted
or
supported
by
findings
of
fact.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
there
was
not,
your
honor.
now,
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
court
started
by
saying,
after
stating
who
the
parties
were
and
that
the
defendants
filed
answers
and
the
evidence
was
aduced
for
their
respective
parties.
an
amicus
curiae
makes
the
contention
which
has
been
adapted
by
the
defendants,
and
incidentally,
was
adapted
by
the
court,
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
question
of
constitutionality
raised
by
plaintiffs
because
that
question
has
never
been
presented
to
the
illinois
supreme
court.
and
hence,
the
federal
courts
are
without
jurisdiction
to
determine
it
in
the
first
instance,
citing
spector
motor
company
versus
mclaughlin
323
u.s.,
and
federation
of
labor
versus
mcadory
325
u.s.
neither
of
which
was
a
three-judge
court
case.
the
spector
motor
case
was
asserted
in
the
district
court
of
connecticut,
which
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
accordance
with
the
connecticut
law,
and
also,
purported
to
raise
a
federal
question
as
to
the
validity
of
that
connecticut
statute.
the
district
court
in
that
case
found
that
the
–
there
was
no
federal
question
involved
because
the
statute
didn't
apply
to
the
plaintiffs
at
all.
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeal
said,
“well,
yes,
it
does
apply
to
the
--
to
the
plaintiff,
but
the
statute
is
valid.”
and
the
case
came
here
and
this
court
said,
“well,
here
is
the
district
court,
may
had
interpreted
one
way
and
the
court
of
appeals
determines
another
way
and
we
can't
tell
it's
very
big
and
we
don't
know
what
it
is
if
it's
--
if
it's
so
vague
and
if
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
plaintiff
at
all,
then
there
is
no
federal
question.”
they
sent
it
back
and
they
said,
“the
district
court
of
course
had
jurisdiction,”
but
they
should
hold
it
until
it
find
out
what
the
law
means
in
the
state
court.
now,
the
district
court
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
yes,
it
has
your
honor.
it
has
been
held
valid
in
illinois
that
some
question
as
to
the
character
of
the
business
that
the
plaintiffs
were
doing
in
that
particular
case.
the
illinois
court
has
flatly
said
that
this
act
is
valid.
it
doesn't
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
cited
in
a
case
in
which
two
of
the
plaintiffs
were
partnership
who
are
engaged
only
in
the
check
cashing
business.
the
third
plaintiff
was
engaged
in
the
check
cashing
business,
but
he
was
also
engaged
in
selling
checks.
there
is
a
customer
coming
by,
check
to
pay
the
light
bill
and
he
write
his
check
and
send
it
to
the
light
company.
he
said,
“that's
not
selling
money
orders,
but
if
it
is
selling
money
orders,
then
this
act
is
discriminatory
against
me.
let's
see,
american
express
company
do
things
that
i
can't
do.”
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said,
“well,
that's
–
that's
selling
money
orders
all
right.
it
didn't
matter
the
form
of
it,
whether
it's
a
check
or
whatever
it
is.
it's
an
order
on
somebody
to
pay,
and
it's
a
money
order
all
right.”
but
the
court
said,
“this
act
is
valid
because
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
this
classification,
because
this
american
express
company
is
a
nationally
big
organization
and
not
a
community
currency
exchange.
and
therefore,
the
act
is
perfectly
valid.”
now,
i'll
come
to
that
again.
i
don't
want
to
evade
that
question,
your
honor,
but
i'll
come
back
to
that.
now,
the
district
court
said,
after
describing
these
activities
with
the
american
express,
the
plaintiff
and
after
reciting
the
statute,
pointing
out
that
in
effect,
that
the
plaintiff
is
within
the
definition
of
a
community
currency
exchange,
whereas
american
express
is
excluded
from
it.
it
does
appears
that
plaintiff's
intend
to
engage
in
only
one
phase
of
the
activities
in
which
a
community
currency
exchange
may
engage
if
licensed
under
the
act
in
question.
that
is,
the
business
of
selling
or
issuing
money
orders
under
their
name.
it
also
appears
that
american
express
company,
which
is
exempt
from
the
operation
of
this
act,
is
engaging
in
the
same
activity.
it
further
appears
that
plaintiffs
intend
to
and
american
express
company
does
engaged
in
his
business
through
agents
operating
retail
stores
of
the
same
types.
now,
the
court
proceeded
then
to
say
this,
at
page
506
of
the
record.
the
plaintiffs
argued
that,
“it
is
the
function
and
duty
of
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
act
in
question
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
applied
to
these
plaintiffs.”
on
the
other
hand,
the
amicus
curiae
and
the
defendants
argued
that
it
is
not
the
function
and
duty
of
this
court
to
determine
that
question,
unless
and
until
plaintiffs
secure
an
answer
to
that
question
from
the
illinois
supreme
court.
and
the
court
then
says,
“it
would
seem
that
a
plausible
argument
could
be
made
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiffs
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
the
identical
similarity
of
the
business
conducted
by
american
express
company,
which
is
exempt
from
regulation
under
the
act,
and
then
in
which
plaintiffs
intend
to
engage
and
which
on
its
phase,
the
act
says,
“it
must
be
regulated
from
the
state,”
is
an
arbitrary
discrimination.
if
this
argument
were
made
to
and
accepted
as
valid
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
it
might
well
grant
the
plaintiffs
the
very
relief
which
they're
seeking
in
this
court,
and
hence,
a
suit
of
this
character
would
be
unnecessary.
in
other
words,
if
the
plaintiffs
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
they
got
a
decision
there
that
this
act
is
valid
and
doesn't
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states,
i
assume
from
the
court's
opinion
they
could
then
come
into
the
three-judge
district
court
and
have
a
review
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
but
that
is
the
function
of
this
court,
not
a
three-judge
courts
which
as
i
understand
it
are
given
by
congress
jurisdiction
in
this
very
kind
of
suit.
and
i
know
of
no
case
and
the
dissenting
judge,
judge
hoffman
said
he
was
aware
of
no
decision
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
held
that
a
federal
district
court
must
or
even
should
refuse
to
entertain
a
suit
under
the
circumstances
present
here.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
if
the
--
if
the
court
please,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
--
that
has
been
said
but
that
has
been
said
most
often,
if
not,
always
in
cases
coming
up
from
the
state
courts.
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
cases
initially
filed
in
their
federal
courts,
we
will
determine
separability,
but
we
will
give
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
yes,
your
honor,
but
we
will
give
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
--
i
can't,
for
the
moment,
tell
you
the
case
but
i
--
i
have
it
here,
but
i
want
to
say
this.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
if
--
if
your
honor
please,
the
state
supreme
court,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
already,
in
the
case
to
which
i
referred,
said
that
this
statute
would
not
have
been
passed
by
the
legislature.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
right.
well,
that's
--
that
is
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
i
--
i
was
approaching
it,
giving
you
the
wrong
answer
first
and
perhaps
the
weaker
answer
first,
but
at
any
rate,
that
is
the
case.
now,
furthermore,
your
honor,
i
want
to
answer
that
just
a
little
bit
further.
this
–
this
exemption
is
set
forth
in
a
definition
of
the
word
community
currency
exchange,
and
that
expression,
community
currency
exchange
so
defined,
occurs
i
think
at
62
times
in
20
different
sections
of
this
act.
so
that
when
you
emasculate
a
part
of
this
definition,
you
change
the
meaning
of
the
word
community
currency
exchanges
and
at
least
20
sections
of
this
act,
so
that
it
couldn't
conceivably
be
a
separable
provision
that
could
stand
on
its
own
and
allow
the
rest
remain
without
being
affected.
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
in
the
mcdougall
case
has
said
that
surely
the
legislature
would
never
have
passed
this
act,
if
it
had
applied
that
they'd
meant
for
it
to
apply
at
all
to
the
american
express.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
mcdougall
versus
lueder,
yes
your
honor.
now,
the
district
court
went
on
to
say,
“but
whether
in
a
plaintiff
situation,
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
hold
the
exemption
of
american
express
company
from
the
application
of
the
act,
constitutional
or
unconstitutional,
we
do
not
know.”
and
they
say
that
unless,
until
that's
decided,
they
don't
know
where
they
are
and
they
say,
“hence,
we
can
not
decide
the
constitutional
question
presented
in
the
absence
of
such
authoritative
determination
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.”
then,
they
said
on
the
next
page,
“the
illinois
supreme
court
might
find
that
to
deny
the
plaintiffs
of
that
right
would
be
to
deprive
them
of
the
same
protection
which
american
express
company
enjoys
under
the
law.”
it
well
may
be
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
hold
the
exception
of
american
express
company
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
persons
in
the
position
of
these
plaintiffs.
now,
i
think
it
a
fair
conclusion
from
the
opinion
and
from
statements
the
court
made
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
that
this
court
thought
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
relief.
they
favored
the
plaintiffs
on
the
merits,
but
they
thought
that
is
the
majority
thoughts
that
they
didn't
have
a
jurisdiction
to
give
the
relief
which
should
be
given
because
the
court
said
this,
"a
three-judge,
court
in
a
case
involving
a
similar
situation
arising
under
the
currency
exchange
act
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
held
that
the
exception
of
american
express
company
rendered
the
statute
discriminatory
and
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
currency
services
verus
matthews,
u.f.
supp.
40
at
43,
45.”
however,
there,
no
question
was
raised
as
to
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction,
such
as
the
question
which
now
confronts
us.
in
other
words,
i
take
it
what
the
court
was
intending
to
say
that
the
court
didn't
pass
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
which
i
had
thought,
in
the
very
rendering
of
the
decision
and
necessarily
passed
on
their
jurisdiction,
but
that
is
the
only
distinction,
otherwise,
this
court
is
disposed
to
follow
that.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
right.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
the
suggestion
exactly.
now,
in
the
–
in
the
currency
services
versus
matthews
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
not
so
far
as
one
in
the
position
of
these
plaintiffs
is
concerned.
that's
perfectly
true,
but
in
the
--
in
the
case
in
wisconsin,
in
which
judge
lindley
wrote
the
opinion,
currency
services
versus
matthews,
there
had
been
no
decision
whatsoever
of
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
construing
the
wisconsin's
statute
and
--
but
–
but
this
court
says,
"well,
that's
--
that's
true
but
then
this
question
of
jurisdiction
wasn't
raised
there."
in
other
words,
the
inferences,
if
the
question
had
been
raised
there
then,
you
can't
determine
the
constitution
now
to
this
because
the
wisconsin
court
hasn't
passed
on
the
constitutionality,
then
--
then
the
court
would
have
had
the
same
thing
to
do
that
this
court
did
here.
they
have
to
say,
“well,
we
can't
pass
on
the
constitutionality
and
the
state
--
until
the
state
court
does.
now,
we
--
there's
no
question
about
it,
if
the
statute
is
not
clear
as
to
either
its
meaning
or
as
to
its
application.
the
state
court
is
the
one
that
determines
that,
or
if
there's
some
question
about
its
separability
and
as
i
say,
particularly
the
case
coming
from
the
--
from
the
state
courts
and
i,
with
all
do
deference
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
believe
that
i
can
cite
the
court
cases
where
this
court
has
undertaken
to
determine
the
question
of
separability
and
cases
coming
from
the
federal
court.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
i
--
well,
i
--
i
think
i
do
now
and
i
maybe,
your
honor,
have
it.
well,
now
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
they
did,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
because
the
--
the
plaintiff
who
raised
the
question
was
engaged
both
in
the
business
of
selling
money
orders
and
cashing
checks.
so,
the
argument
is
well,
that
would
be
different
if
we
had
somebody
that's
engaged
only
in
the
selling
money
orders.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
i
think
it
comes
awfully
close.
i
think
--
and
the
language
of
the
court
as
judge
hoffman
said
in
his
dissent,
the
plaintiffs
supported
for
the
decision
of
another
three-judge
court
in
currency
services
versus
matthews,
have
raised
a
substantial
federal
constitutional
question.
the
application
of
the
challenged
statute
to
the
plaintiffs
is
unquestioned,
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
already
upheld
the
exemption
of
american
express
company
without
suggesting
that
its
decision
in
any
way
rested
on
the
nature
of
the
activities
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
decided
case,
mcdougall
versus
leuder.
then
he
says,
“the
balance
between
the
state
and
federal
relations
is
not
so
delicate
that
it
would
be
upset
by
this
court's
consideration
of
the
merits
of
the
plaintiffs'
claim
that
the
illinois
currency
exchange
act
has
deprived
them
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.”
now,
i
said
that
their
conclusion
from
the
opinion
and
from
the
court's
statements,
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
i
think
was
just
--
which
is
that
the
court
thought
the
plaintiff
should
have
relief,
the
plaintiff
should
have
relief.
at
page
97
of
the
record,
judge
schnackenberg
said
this,
“i
have
a
question
i'd
like
to
ask
mr.
wines
and
his
associates
from
the
states
attorney's
office.
it
is
a
little
bit
out
of
order
in
the
way
of
taking
things
up
seriatim
chronologically.
that
may
take
--
that
may
point
to
some
thought
that
it's
in
the
court's
mind
which
it
caused
you
in
your
whole
argument
--
oral
argument
to
direct
your
argument
of
what
you
think
the
court
may
be
thinking
about
among
other
things.
here
is
a
question
i'd
like
you
to
listen
to
very
carefully
if
you
will.
suppose
the
state
legislature
enacts
a
statute,
providing
for
a
state
inspection
of
all
weighing
scales
used
in
retail
food
shops
to
be
evidenced
by
adhesive
stamp,
affixed
by
the
inspector
of
this
scale
and
providing
that
the
owner
should
pay
a
fee
for
inspection
and
keep
the
stamp
affixed
for
public
exhibition
and
use
no
unstamped
scale
in
his
shop,
and
also
providing
penalties
for
violating
a
statute.
and
further
providing
that
the
statute
should
not
apply
to
the
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
shops
and
the
scales
they're
in.
if
an
owner
of
four
or
five
retail
food
shops
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
as
violative
of
the
federal
constitution's
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
law
provisions,
should
the
court
sustain
that
challenge?”
well,
mr.
wines
answered
that
at
page
99,
“now,
to
come
back
specifically
to
the
hypothetical
case
put
by
your
honor,
judge
schnackenberg,
i
would
say
that
if
there
were
only
one
grocery's
chain
of
such
worldwide
establishment
that
exempting
that
chain
might
very
well
be
constitutional.”
then
he
says,
“i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
situation
in
the
grocery
store
business.
so,
just
to
answer
your
question,
yes
or
no,
i
would
say
that
the
question
that,
your
honor
puts,
the
act
would
be
unconstitutional
but
that
it
is
distinguishable.”
now,
then,
the
friend
of
the
court
upon
whom
the
court
relied
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
mr.
soble.
well,
he
came
in
and
said
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
it's
--
i'm
not
sure
who.
he
came
in
and
asked
to
interplead,
your
honor,
and
re-oppose
this
interpleading
and
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
just
an
individual,
a
friend
of
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
technically.
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
saying
that.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
that's
--
that
i
think
is
correct.
now,
he
undertook
to
answer
this
question
that
the
court
had
propounded
about
the
great
atlantic
--
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
and
he
says
at
page
113
of
the
record,
“now,
if
for
instance,
it
is
a
fact
that
the
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
had
never
had
a
case
where
they
had
been
accused
of
false
weighing
and
they
have
never,
by
some
ingenious
method
of
their
own,
they
cannot
possibly
make
a
mistake
in
that
regard,
then
that
differentiation
would
be
valid
because
the
legislature
is
not
supposed
to
encompass
all
degrees
of
people
that
it
may
seek
to
remedy
by
its
legislation.
if
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
fair
to
presume
that
the
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
is
only
human
and
they
do
make
mistakes
in
their
machines,
frequently,
they
are
too
busy
to
have
their
machines
corrected.
why
then,
it
is
quite
obvious
that
there
is
no
factual
basis
for
that
discrimination,
and
if
there
is
no
factual
basis
for
that
discrimination,
of
course,
the
discrimination
or
the
classification
would
be
invalid.”
now,
let's
see
what
about
this
human
element
in
this
case.
at
page
361,
appears
the
deposition
of
mr.
smith,
the
executive
vice
president
of
the
american
express
company.
question,
“i
believe
you
said
that
the
creditor
of
various
agents
varies
some
or
more
responsible
perhaps
another,
is
that
right?
answer,
“that
is
right.”
question,
“i
suppose
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
sometimes
an
agent
goes
wrong,
is
not
that
right?”
answer,
“occasionally,
yes
sir.”
question,
“suppose,
mr.
smith,
an
agent
in
the
state
of
illinois
does
go
wrong
and
he
disappeared
and
checks
start
coming
in
and
out
of
the
float?
i
believe
that
refund
was
the
term
and
you
have
reason
to
believe
from
some
information
you
receive
that
perhaps
the
agent
was
in
cahoots,
let's
say,
with
some
people
of
his
and
that
some
of
these
money
orders
that
are
presented
for
payment
are
not
legitimate.
has
anything
like
that
--
ever
happened?
mr.
john
j.
yowell
oh,
they
heard
all
of
this,
your
honor.
they
heard
all
of
this
and
this
was
a
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no,
i
--
i
don't
--
well
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no.
the
late
findings
of
fact,
your
honor,
they
made
findings
of
fact
on
the
case
and
they
refused
to
--
as
the
court
--
as
the
--
the
appellee
say
in
their
brief,
they
refused
to
make
findings
of
fact
that
they
requested
here,
and
i
am
getting
to
another
thing
that
they
have
alleged,
their
claim
in
their
brief
that
the
plaintiffs
didn't
come
into
the
court
with
clean
hands
here.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
they
said
that
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction
but
they
proceeded
to
pass
on
various
things
and
made
findings
of
fact.
they
did
make
findings
of
fact
as
i've
already
gone
over
with
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
yowell
conclusion
of
law,
yes
your
honor,
they
did.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
--
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no.
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
pass
on
the
merits
except
to
--
to
remand
the
case.
well,
i
--
i
would
like
the
court
to
remand
the
case
and
direct
that
the
--
that
the
relief
prayed
for
be
granted
because
the
case
has
been
tried.
i'm
trying
to
show
to
your
honors
now
that
the
court
very
clearly
did
believe
that
the
plaintiff
was
--
the
plaintiffs
should
have
the
relief
they
were
praying
for
but
they
have
merely
got
in
the
wrong
court
or
at
least
they
--
they
were
premature.
they
first
should
have
the
--
the
state
court
to
pass
on
the
constitutionality,
and
then,
they
were
--
the
state
court
would
have
probably
given
the
relief
they
were
seeking
here.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
conclusion.
that's
all
the
conclusions
of
law
but
the
conclusions
of
fact
were
that
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
certainly
not
that
the
--
that
the
plaintiffs
are
--
should
have
the
relief
they're
praying
and
that's
all
right
that
there
was
no
such
conclusion
as
that.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that
was
the
final
order.
that's
at
page
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
510,
in
accordance
of
abuse
expressed
in
the
court's
opinion
that
the
case
be
dismissed
for
one
of
this
court's
jurisdiction,
but
they
--
the
court
certainly
indicated
in
every
way
they
could
indicate
that
--
that
the
plaintiffs
should
have
the
relief.
now,
perhaps
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
what
is
before
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no,
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
strictly
speaking,
the
only
question
before
this
court,
the
really
one
question,
did
the
court
have
jurisdiction?
and
perhaps
secondly,
and
i
think
this
is
in
it.
should
the
court
have
exercised
the
jurisdiction
which
it
had?
those
are
the
only
two
questions,
as
i
conceive
it,
that
are
before
this
court.
and
as
i
say,
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
--
would
go
further
in
view
of
the
record
but
i'm
not
saying
that
they
--
that
they
could
on
this
--
that
should
on
this
record.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
i
--
i
think
you're
right
and
i
--
i
stand
corrected.
i
think
that
is
the
correct
answer,
your
honor
that
i
should
have
made.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
i
say
that
the
only
questions
before
this
court
are,
one,
was
the
court
right
or
wrong
in
saying
it
had
no
jurisdiction?
and
two,
assuming
it
had
jurisdiction,
should
that
in
this
character
case
exercise
that
jurisdiction?
now,
the
argument
was
made
here
that
the
court
shouldn't
exercise
its
jurisdiction
because
it
--
it's
not
time
to
do
it
where
they
say
that
the
--
because
the
state
court
hasn't
passed
on
it,
but
there's
no
suggestion
anywhere
in
this
record
that
there's
anything
indefinite
about
this
act,
that
it
isn't
perfectly
clear
and
is
to
its
--
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
plaintiffs.
they've
made
the
threat
against
the
plaintiffs.
they
admitted
the
file
to
the
complaints.
so,
there's
nothing
for
any
state
court
to
do
in
a
way
of
clarification
either
the
meaning
of
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
write
an
opinion
which
would
clarify
the
law
as
to
this
jurisdictional
matter
and
if
the
court
would
direct
the
court
to
enter
a
--
to
take
their
action
in
accordance
to
this
opinion.
now,
i
suppose
technically,
the
court
could
change
their
minds
from
what
i
thought
it
was
and
say,
“well,
we
think
that
this
--
this
plea
here
of
an
--
of
your
not
coming
in
with
clean
hands
is
a
good
plea.”
we
perhaps
didn't
think
so
before
but
we
now
make
a
finding
that
it's
good
and
so
you're
up
because
of
that,
and
i
want
to
refer
just
very
briefly
to
that.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no,
your
honor.
all
the
facts
are
here,
there's
nothing
else.
the
case
has
been
tried
fully
and
completely
and
this
question
of
jurisdiction
and
the
question
of
whether
the
courts
have
exercised
its
jurisdiction,
and
the
question
where
the
plaintiffs
come
in
with
clean
hands
or
not,
have
all
been
argued
to
the
court
below
and
they
--
they
didn't
take
those
arguments
--
that
argument
about
to
clean
hand
seriously.
they
made
no
finding
and
counsel
in
the
brief
say
that
the
court
refused
to
make
those
findings
although
requested.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
your
honor,
i
have
to
say
this.
you
have
here
findings
of
fact
for
this
court
that
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
you
--
under
this
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no,
your
honor,
i
say
this.
under
the
challenged
statute
by
the
definition
of
community
currency
exchange,
except
for
united
states
post
office
money
orders
and
western
union
telegraph
orders
which
are
regulated
by
the
federal
law
that
nobody
including
the
plaintiffs
in
the
state
of
illinois
can
engage
in
a
certain
character
of
business.
they
cannot
sell
money
orders
in
a
drug
store
or
in
any
other
retail
store,
but
the
american
express
company
--
not
the
american
express
company
and
not
the
--
not
the
first
company
can
through
agents,
but
the
same
people,
the
same
druggist,
and
they
–
there
are
two
classes
that
are
made.
those
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
statutes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
i
think
you've
got
something
the
state
couldn't
possibly
regulate
that,
i
think.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
they
can
regulate
--
they
regulate
the
plaintiff
but
they
don't
regulate
the
--
the
people
who
are
selling
american
express
company
money
orders
and
the
thing
that
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor
that
the
question
is
--
is
presented
to
this
court
on
this
record
whether
or
not
this
exemption
is
valid
or
invalid
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
i
--
i
had
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
i
think
--
i
think
there
is,
if
the
court
please.
here,
the
questions
are
presented
by
the
appeal.
one,
whether
the
illinois
community
currency
exchanges
act
denies
the
plaintiffs
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states
in
view
of
the
identical
similarity
to
business
conducted
by
american
express
company
in
illinois
and
that
which
plaintiffs
are
engaged
and
intend
to
engage
in
illinois.
in
that,
a
said
statute
imposes
licensed
fees
and
conditions
upon
the
sale
of
bondified
systems
money
orders
in
separate
business
establishments
and
to
exempt
such
sales
of
american
express
company
money
orders
from
all
such
requirements.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
all
i
can
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
case
is
--
is
here
on
--
on
an
appeal
from
that
court
and
i
have
thought
that
there
was
involved
in
the
case,
the
validity
of
this
statute.
now,
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
then
i
suppose
this
court
would
send
it
back
to
the
court
and
say,
“you
do
have
jurisdiction
if
that
the
court
finds
they
do.”
i
don't
know
that
they
will,
but
if
this
court
finds
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
might
go
further
than
to
say,
“now,
determine
whether
or
not
this
statute
is
valid
so
that
it
can
come
up
to
us
again
and
we
can
pass
on
that.”
i
should
think
the
statute
is
here
and
it's
presented
and
the
findings
of
fact
are
made
which
presents
the
very
issue,
and
it's
true
the
court
said
they
had
no
jurisdiction
but
i
think
that
the
court
clearly
did
have
jurisdiction
and
i
think
that
it
would
become
contrary
to
every
decision
that
i
have
read,
if
you
said
they
do
not
have,
that
they
did
not
have.
now,
the
--
this
argument,
i
didn't
want
to
stop
that.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
leave
that
subject
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
now,
the
--
there
was
this
issue
here
and
it's
attempted
to
be
presented
to
this
court
that
because
on
these
money
orders
which
were
copyrighted
or
registered
form,
there
was
the
statement,
“license
and
bonded”
that
that
is
somehow
a
representation
to
the
public
that
these
--
these
plaintiffs
are
licensed
under
the
illinois
statute
which
they
have
urged
statute
they're
challenging.
and
the
form
of
the
money
order
appears
at
page
224
of
the
record
and
it
shows
on
its
phase
that
these
money
orders
are
issued
under
a
license
that
bondified
money
order
service
operated
under
license
granted
to
bondified
systems.
following
the
word
“bondified”
is
an
asterisk.
down
at
the
bottom,
it
says,
abbreviated,
registered
u.s.
patent
dollars.
the
left
of
that,
it
says,
“checks
incorporated
minneapolis,
minnesota,”
and
above
that
is
this
trademark,
“bondified
money
transfer.”
and
that's
all
the
evidence
there
is
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
there's
anybody
that
--
that
anybody
has
made
any
representations,
and
under
the
decisions
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
a
license,
the
definition
of
a
license
is
not
limited
to
a
license
from
the
state
and
these
were
licensed
and
these
people
were
bonded,
and
we
say
that
there
was
no
misrepresentation
there
in
any
way
and
the
court
below
--
that
did
not
take
that
seriously
and
refused
to
make
the
final
fact
upon
it.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
if
the
court
--
this
discrimination
is
not
just
plaintiffs
on
the
one
hand
and
the
american
express
company
on
the
other.
this
is
the
agents
of
the
express
company
on
the
one
hand
and
plaintiffs'
agents
on
the
other.
mr.
derrick
used
to
sell
american
express
money
orders.
he
didn't
have
to
have
a
license.
he
didn't
have
to
be
inspected.
he
didn't
have
to
do
anything.
he
wasn't
subject
to
the
act.
the
minute
he
starts
selling
the
plaintiffs'
money
orders,
he
is
absolutely
prohibited
by
the
act
from
selling,
and
the
result
is
that
the
american
express
company
has
an
absolute
monopoly
in
the
state
of
illinois
of
the
sale
of
money
orders
in
retail
establishments.
that
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no,
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
must
say
though
that
i'm
not
as
familiar
with
the
problems,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
it
does
because
i
think
here,
you
have
got
an
absolute
monopoly
given
by
name
to
one
corporation
that's
singled
out.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
i'm
--
mr.
john
j.
yowell
well,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
all
right.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
yowell
no,
your
honor.
the
--
we're
talking
about
little
money
orders
here
that
averaged
$5
or
$10,
if
people
pay
their
light
bills
already,
and
the
maximum
is
a
$100.
the
average
of
all
the
money
orders
in
american
express
sales
is
$10
according
to
the
--
their
chief
officer.
and
this
bonafide
system
sales
money
orders
in
various
different
states
as
the
record
shows
and
illinois
is
the
only
one
now
that
has
this
prohibition
and
regulates
the
business
of
money
order
sales
and
it
exempts
the
american
express
company,
and
all
the
other
states,
they
use
the
same
money
order
which
says
that
they're
licensed
here
from
these
checks
incorporated
and
they
are
bonded
and
they
are
licensed.
and
i
was
about
to
read
the
evidence
on
that,
but
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
that
because
we
have
said
in
our
reply
brief
that
this
court
is
asked
to
weigh
evidence
and
make
findings
which
the
district
court
refused
to
make
and
fail
to
make
and
made
in
contrary
to
have
in
findings
that
it
did
make.
and
that
this
court
has
asked
to
draw
inferences
which
the
district
court
refused
to
draw
on
this
question
of
--
of
coming
in
with
clean
hands.
now,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
--
of
the
decision
in
the
toomer
case
which
was
the
fishery
case
where
the
shippers
were
of
georgia
for
complaining
to
cross
south
carolina,
wouldn't
let
them.
well,
they
imposed
a
very
large
license
fees
on
their
shrimping
in
the
waters
of
north
carolina.
and
they
challenged
that
statute
and
this
court
said
that
statute
deprived
them
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
and
the
--
the
claim
was
made
to
that
case
by
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina.
it's
north
carolina
or
south
carolina
that
these
plaintiffs,
these
shrimpers
are
coming
in
here,
saying
that
their
shrimping
business
was
being
discriminated
against
that
were
convicts.
they
had
repeatedly
been
convicted
of
shrimping
contrary
to
the
--
to
the
law
and
they
--
they
have
served
sentences
for
it.
and
this
court
said
this,
“some
of
the
individual
appellants
have
previously
been
convicted
of
shrimping
out
of
season
and
into
waters.
the
district
court
held
that
this
previous
misconduct,
not
have
any
relation
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
challenged
statutes
did
not
call
for
application
of
the
clean
hands
maxim.
we
agree.”
now,
that's
all
what
i
want
to
say
on
that
point.
i
want
to
say
so
far
as
the
--
the
exercise
of
federal
equity
jurisdiction
is
concerned,
of
course,
this
court
has
always
held
that
the
court
will
not
come
in
just
to
--
to
enjoin
the
--
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
statute,
but
the
exception
is,
if
there
is
danger,
immediate
danger
of
irreparable
injury,
they
will
do
so.
that's
what
they
did
in
this
toomer
versus
witsell
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
we
cited
number
of
other
cases
at
pages
11
and
12
of
the
brief
for
the
appellants.
here
are
men
engaged,
the
citizens
of
illinois
engaged
in
a
business.
during
the
year
before
this
trial,
they
showed
that
they've
sold
a
$1,400,000
worth
of
these
money
orders
in
northern
indiana
under
the
same
licensure
operating
under
in
chicago.
sure,
they
only
got
one
agent.
they
had
to
have
a
case.
they
had
to
--
have
a
justiciable
case.
they
couldn't
get
in
as
a
corporation
because
there
was
an
arrangement
made
between
the
secretary
of
state
office
and
this
audito,
this
is
in
the
record.
so,
they've
--
they
couldn't
stop
it
from
acting
as
individuals.
they
couldn't
give
--
wouldn't
give
them
corporate
license
in
illinois
so
they
couldn't
get
in,
couldn't
have
any
standard,
but
they
operated
as
individuals
and
they
did
the
best
they
could.
and
we
submit,
your
honor
that
the
--
the
jurisdiction
is
clear.
these
people
have
been
deprived
and
everyday
they're
prevented
from
operating.
they're
losing
money,
and
now,
it
said
they
have
to
go
to
the
state
court
or
the
state
supreme
court
and
again
come
up
here,
in
the
meantime
that
the
laws
is
irremedial
because
you
never
could
get
it
back
from
the
state
or
anyone
else,
and
it
does
come
within
the
exception
and
is
supported
by
the
cases,
we
contend
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
thank
you
very
much.
