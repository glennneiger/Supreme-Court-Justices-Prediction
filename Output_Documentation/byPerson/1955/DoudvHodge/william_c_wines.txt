mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
i
should
like
to
begin
or
rather
precede
my
argument
with
a
narrative
exposition
of
the
history
of
the
legislation,
the
facts
in
the
case,
the
judicial
proceedings
ultimating
in
the
judgment
in
opinion
now
before
your
honors
for
review.
i
think
when
that
narration
is
made,
the
questions
properly
presented
and
knows
what
your
honors
made
but
would
not
be
obliged
to
entertain
will
emerge
very
clearly.
your
honors,
for
some
reason
which
is
not
only
is
undisclosed
by
the
record,
but
which
i
haven't
been
able
to
learn
on
or
off
the
record.
in
the
depression
of
1933,
currency
exchanges
have
become
amazingly
more
popular
in
illinois
than
in
any
other
state
in
the
union.
nobody
seems
to
know
why
that's
true,
but
it
is
an
interesting
economic
phenomenon.
they've
had
some
unusual
vitality
in
california
and
new
york
but
it's
become
a
very
large
industry
in
illinois.
so,
illinois
passed
a
currency
exchange
act
as
now
amended
and
is
before
this
court,
it
declares
currency
exchanges
to
be
effective
with
the
public
interest
and
intimately
integrated
in
the
economic
fabric
of
illinois.
it
licenses
them.
it
regulates
them.
provides
for
revocation
of
licenses
in
the
case
of
failure
to
comply
with
regulations,
and
in
general,
stepped
in
a
particular
of
this
exemption.
the
law
is
not
challenged
by
these
appellants
as
a
valid
and
constitutional
regulatory
major.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
i'll
be
happy
to
do
that,
your
honor.
i
plan
to
argue
first
that
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
remitting
the
plaintiffs,
the
appellants
to
the
state
courts,
although,
the
expression
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
is
ambiguous
and
i
don't
intend
to
concede
that
the
court
meant
or
if
it
did
mean
that
it
was
correct
in
meaning,
that
it
lacked
federal
jurisdiction
of
a
fourteenth
amendment
question
if
substantial
or
of
$3000
or
anything
of
that
sort.
i
plan
to
argue
that
they
meant
that
in
light
of
well
settled
principles
they
should
forbear
the
exercise
of
federal
equitable
jurisdiction
in
this
cause.
i
plan
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
did.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
did.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
for
reasons
which
--
but
not
entirely
on
the
grounds
designed
in
the
opinion.
now,
i'm
still
answering
your
honor's
question
as
to
what
i'm
going
to
argue.
i'm
going
to
argue
that
if
--
first
is
i'm
going
to
insist
that
the
--
that
they
reached
the
correct
result
in
remitting
the
cause
to
the
illinois
court.
i'm
going
to
argue
that
if
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
mean
remitting
the
parties,
not
the
cause.
of
course
they
couldn't
transfer
the
case
as
this
court
can
and
the
court
of
appeals.
i
meant
in
telling
the
parties
to
recur,
repair
to
the
illinois
in
tribunals.
i'm
going
to
argue
that
if
the
merits
are
before
this
court,
were
before
the
district
court,
this
court
can.
this
court
has
the
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
case
on
the
merits
without
remanding,
and
i'm
going
to
ask
with
all
the
earnestness
that
i
can
that
although
ordinarily,
this
court
won't
do
it
in
this
case
when
i
have
made
my
expository
merit.
i
hope
to
persuade
your
honors
that
the
--
the
facts
in
this
case
are
so
clear
that
it
will
not
require
a
canvass
of
this
record.
in
fact,
it
will
exempt
to
require
an
examination
of
only
one
page
of
this
record,
which
i'll
come
to
later,
and
that
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court,
three-judge
district
court
would
in
this
particular
case
do
not
generally
be
a
work
of
pure
supererogation,
but
i
can't
support
that
argument
until
i've
made
my
narrative
of
that.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
so.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that's
--
that's
correct,
but
that
the
reasons
why
i'm
knowing
for
well
what's
in
your
honor's
mind
in
having
had
the
benefit
of
your
honor's
colloquy
with
mr.
yowell,
the
reason
why
i'm
still
so
earnestly
asking
this
will
become
apparent
when
i'm
through
with
my
narration
of
the
facts,
which
will
put
the
case,
i
think,
in
a
different
light
from
what
it
is
now.
well,
now,
in
enacting
this
currency
exchange
act,
the
general
assembly
of
illinois
defines
a
currency
exchange
in
substance
as
any
concern
that
either
cashing
checks
for
a
fee
or
issues
money
orders
for
a
fee
or
does
both
of
those
things.
there
are
some
other
provisions
in
the
definition
but
nobody
raises
any
question
about
them
so
that
would
suffice
for
this
court's
consideration
now.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
don't
charge
an
illinois
bank.
it
doesn't
charge
a
depositor.
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
don't
know
of
any
illinois
bank
that
charges
for
cashing
a
check.
there
are
some
banks
that
charge
you
for
every
check
that
you
write
and
don't
require
you
to
have
a
minimum.
but
generally
speaking,
no,
the
illinois
banks
do
not
charge
for
cashing
checks.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
do.
nobody
knows
why,
but
they
do.
now,
i
mean
why
in
illinois
but
--
but
they
--
but
they
do.
now,
well,
it
is
a
convenience
and
many
people
don't
have
banking
facilities
and
they're
--
they
operate
on
--
on
saturdays
and
i
don't
think
they
operate
on
sundays.
now,
the
illinois
act
does
exempt
by
name,
the
western
union
telegraph
company,
the
postal
telegraph
company,
the
american
express
company
and
of
course,
the
united
states
post
office.
i
wish
to
make
it
very
clear
that
we
do
not
try
to
collect
license
fees
from
the
united
states
post
office.
now,
when
the
act
--
when
the
act
was
first
passed,
the
operators
of
currency
exchanges
and
--
and
not
those
just
engaged
in
the
cashing
of
checks.
mr.
yowell's
memory
hasn't
served
incorrectly
in
the
mcdougall
case
that
plaintiffs
were
engaged
in
the
operation
of
community
currency
exchanges
in
which
they
sold
money
orders.
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
say
that
the
exemption
of
the
american
express
company
was
constitutional,
and
did
make
the
observation
which
was
a
dictum
and
which
was
a
dictum,
not
made
in
the
light
of
the
record
that's
been
made
here,
and
not
made
in
the
light
of
a
subsequent
federal
decision
coming
from
wisconsin.
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
say
in
the
mcdougall
case
that
the
exemption
was
constitutional
and
that
the
act
would
not
have
been
passed
had
not
been
possibly
exempted.
all
right,
there
had
been
some
amendments
to
the
act
but
they
don't
intervene
here.
now,
the
american
--
now,
the
american
express
company's
activities
would
soon
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
only
by
way
of
a
dictum
and
not
in
the
light
of
the
considerations
urged
in
this
case.
i
say
it
is
not
a
definitive
authoritative
illinois
decision
on
that
point.
that's
what
i
say
about
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i
think
it
is.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
could
say
that.
i
don't
see
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
thought
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
fieldcrest
case,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
but
don't
you
see
this
difference,
your
honor,
if
--
that's
your
honors
holding
it,
but
it
was
this
three-judge
district
court,
if
these
plaintiffs
bring
their
suit
in
the
illinois
and
they
go
to
the
illinois
supreme
court,
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
decide
adversely
to
the
very
direct
appeal
here,
they
don't
have
to
face
the
problem
of
this
court's
discretionary
grant
of
certiorari.
if
this
--
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
holds
that
its
exemption
is
constitutional,
and
it
passes
on
that
or
if
it
holds
that
its
--
or
it
holds
that
it's
inseparable,
it
will
have
to
hold
that
it's
constitutional.
then
--
then
they
have
a
direct
--
i
mean,
they'll
have
to
hold
to
this
constitutional
hold
or
act
unconstitutional.
but
if
it
upholds
the
act
and
hold
this
provision
inseparable,
the
plaintiffs
will
have
a
right
of
direct
appeal,
not
certiorari
if
your
honors
think
of
that
time
if
the
question
is
substantial.
if
it
holds
inseparable
and
knocks
it
out,
the
plaintiff
said,
they
wouldn't
want
it
anyway,
so
why
should
the
three
district
--
three-judge
district
court
hold
it.
i
just
suggest
that.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
can
start
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
frankly,
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
much
difference
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
where
they
dismiss
it
or
hold
it
because
the
case
will
come
here
on
direct
appeal
or
certainly,
they
would
dismiss
it
for
failure
to
exhaust
that
right.
i
really
don't
--
i
really
don't
think
it
makes
practical
a
difference
whether
--
whether
they
dismiss
it
or
hold
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
now,
your
honors,
there
are
some
specific
facts
in
this
case,
very
specific
in
the
record
that
had
not
been
called
to
your
honor's
attention.
and
in
some
respect,
mr.
yowell
has
quite
unintentionally
and
because
of
the
limits
of
time,
misled
you,
as
perhaps
i
should
also
dutifully,
unintentionally
and
for
the
same
reason.
he
said
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
that
may
be
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
shouldn't
--
i
--
i
didn't
--
i
withdraw
that.
in
his
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
has
said
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
that
the
american
express
company
is
not
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
have
finished
my
argument
on
the
jurisdictional.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
wasn't
going
to
come
to
that
point
yet,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
coming
to
the
point
that
--
mystery
in
--
in
which
the
facts
have
not
yet
been
stated.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
the
facts
alleged
in
the
--
in
the
complaint
amount
to
a
confession
that
the
plaintiffs
are
using
the
mails
to
defraud
and
that
they
come
into
equity
without
clean
hands.
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
five
minutes
or
three.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
this
case,
yes.
and
i'll
be
glad
to
tell
your
honor
why.
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
your
honors
will
be
good
enough
to
look
at
the
exhibits,
photo
static
exhibits
on
pages
--
on
page
224
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
william
c.
wines
page
224
of
the
transcript.
that's
all
that
i
--
i
would
like
to
have
the
court
to
look
at.
your
honors
will
see
reproduced,
the
photo
stats
of
the
type
of
money
orders
that
these
plaintiffs
aver
and
avow
and
proclaim
that
they're
going
to
sell
if
this
injunction
is
not
granted.
at
the
bottom,
you
will
see,
it's
a
little
hard,
the
sort
of
elliptical
ring
money
transfer
to
the
--
that's
--
that's
black
with
white
letters.
to
the
immediate
left
is
the
word
“licensed”
and
to
the
immediate
right
is
the
word
“bonded.”
i
just
like
to
repeat
that.
to
the
immediate
left
of
that
black
elliptical
ring
is
the
word
“licensed.”
to
the
immediate
right
is
the
word
“bonded.”
these
are
--
these
money
orders
are
to
be
sold
in
illinois.
in
illinois,
we
have
a
statute
licensing
and
requiring
bonds
of
all
companies,
selling
money
orders
except
the
american
express
company.
these
plaintiffs
are
not
licensed
in
illinois
by
any
illinois
authority
and
that
is
admitted
in
the
record
and
i'm
sure
mr.
yowell
will
admit
it
here
if
you
ask
him.
they
are
not
--
they
have
not
filed
any
bond
anywhere
to
disapprove
by
any
kind
of
illinois
state
surveillance
or
supervision.
now,
to
–
and
that
if
these
checks
in
the
state
were
the
public
known
generally,
that
licenses
are
required
and
that
means
a
state
license
and
bonds
are
required
and
that
means
a
bond
approved
by
the
state.
when
they
have
no
state
license,
county
license,
city
license,
precinct
license,
federal
license
or
any
other
kind
of
license,
when
they
posted
no
bond
with
any
public
official,
he
is
such
a
gross
rod
on
the
public
that
they
ought
to
be
dismissed
for
want
of
equity
and
not
coming
in
with
clean
hands.
their
defense
makes
it
even
worst.
they
say
that
the
word
“license”
means
that
they
have
a
licensed
to
use
the
trademark,
the
copyrighted
trademark,
bondified,
that's
their
defense.
it
isn't
copyrighted.
it
isn't
trademarked
and
they
have
not
valid
license
from
the
propriety
to
use
it.
i
will
now
demonstrate
that
from
the
record.
they
do
have
a
written
agreement.
it's
set
forth
in
the
record.
when
in
a
western
outfit
that
has
registered
or
in
some
way
or
other,
they
registered
the
name
bondified
as
a
trademark
on
a
form
of
check,
and
they
have
made
a
written
agreement
which
is
called
a
license
to
the
plaintiffs,
permitting
them
to
use
that
name
but
that's
a
violation
of
the
federal
law,
because
as
we
explained
very
clearly
in
our
brief,
this
court
has
held
that
for
the
proprietor
or
trademark
to
permit
another
person
to
use
it
without
guaranteeing
the
product,
if
it
is
a
product
or
the
financial
responsibility,
if
it
is
a
business
is
contrary
to
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states
in
trademark,
copyright
and
postal
money
orders.
the
pleading
case
on
that
and
it
is
not
as
clearly
set
forth
in
our
brief
as
i
would
--
as
i
might
wish
is
a
--
is
the
manhattan
medicine
company
case.
the
facts
in
that
very
briefly
were
these,
your
honor.
i
can
state
it
briefly
but
it's
all
important.
the
proprietor
of
a
trademark
for
a
medicine,
we'll
call
him
jones,
for
a
consideration
allowed
smith
to
use
the
trademark.
he
didn't
sell
the
business.
if
mr.
jones
had
been
making
manhattan
medicine
and
sold
the
business,
sold
the
assets,
he
wouldn't
personally
have
had
to
guarantee
their
continued
integrity,
but
he
merely
licensed
the
use
of
the
name
without
in
anyway
transferring
the
business,
assuming
responsibility
for
the
product
either
by
way
of
supervising
its
manufacture
and
damnifying
people
for
its
defect.
he
attempted
to
sell
goodwill
without
selling
the
business
and
you
can't
do
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
public
policy,
and
there
just
isn't
any
question
about
it.
a
contract
by
which
one
who
has
built
up
a
trade
name
undertakes
the
reward
to
let
another
use
that
name
without
transferring
and
apart
from
the
business
is
--
has
been
held
fraudulent
so
many
times
that
we
say
that
it
isn't
necessary
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
or
technically,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggest,
remand
it
with
an
instructions
to
dismiss
for
want
of
equity
and
lack
of
clean
hands.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
very
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
wines
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
in
our
brief
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
sir.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
federal
public
policy
that
clearly
emerges
from
the
record.
mr.
william
c.
wines
very
well,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
very
happy
that
your
honor
has
expressed
it
candidly,
but
i
want
to
say
that
nothing
in
my
experience,
the
bar
indicated
anything
improper.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i've
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i've
just
about
finished
it
at
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
receive
the
exhibits
on
which
we
rely
and
which
were
not
--
not
contested.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
was
not,
it
was
not.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
should
not
think
so.
as
with
my
understanding,
your
honor,
that
an
appellee
can
rely
on
any
grounds
of
affirmance
which
does
not
require
the
court
to
weigh
evidence
and
where
the
facts
are
admitted,
they
are
either
found
by
unchallenged
findings
which
these
facts
were
not
or
are
admitted
which
these
facts
are.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
had
just
about
completed
my
argument
on
that
question,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
these
checks
are
on
their
face
misleading,
and
so
clearly,
it's
shockingly
so
that
any
court,
that
however,
a
later
date
to
whose
attention,
it
comes
ought
to
declare
a
new
force,
the
federal
postal
policies.
i
think
it's
a
matter
that
can
be
suggested
at
anytime
or
at
under
any
condition
and
even
the
court
might
wish
do
it
sua
sponte
rather
than
leave
some
illegitimate,
but
nevertheless
potent
inference
that
what
the
matter
in
which
it
could
have
been
presented
was
not
promptly
scratched
by
a
judicial
expression
when
the
fact
is
so
claimed.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
does.
it
is
not
generally
the
policy.
they're
not
making
any
promises
or
representations
as
to
what
the
attorney
general
would
do
or
what
another
attorney
general
would
do
if
my
chief
should
retire,
but
it
is
not
--
not
generally
the
policy
of
the
attorney
general
to
prosecute
cases
where
there
is
a
litigation,
testing
the
validity
of
licensing
provisions
and
that
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
no
prosecutions
have
been
brought
against
--
against
these
claims.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they're
not
but
they
have
within
the
time
fixed
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
was
only
a
token
engagement
and
i
think
it's
–
well,
at
least
about
--
i
shouldn't
say
token
as
reading
their
minds.
it
was
a
very
limited
engagement
by
one
druggist.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
didn't
hear
that
lecture,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
correct.
that's
certainly
correct.
now,
mr.
yowell
has
passed
on
the
--
as
--
as
i
asked
your
honors
to
pass
on
and
has
said
something
about
the
merits
of
this
exemption.
i
think
that
the
merits
of
this
exemption
are
such
that
they
can
and
should
be
passed
upon
in
this
court
even
though
the
district
court
did
not
pass
upon
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
we
do
not.
we
do
not.
we
--
we
do
not
distinguished
it.
i'm
requested
to
but
decline
to.
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
we
--
we
disagree
with
the
--
we
disagree
with
the
wisconsin
decision
and
our
--
our
reasons
are
these.
the
impressive
materials
that
are
in
this
record
were
not
before
the
wisconsin
court.
the
record
shows
in
this
case
the
extent
of
the
american
express
companies'
operations
that
were
not
shown
by
any
evidence
there.
it
was
of
world
--
it's
a
worldwide
--
the
evidence
isn't
contradicted.
it's
an
enterprise
of
worldwide
dimensions.
it
is
supervised
closely
by
the
united
states
government.
it
is
–
it
is
the
depository
of
federal
funds.
it
is
supervised
by
the
state
of
new
york,
and
even
if
there
were
no
other
difference
between
the
american
express
company
and
the
plaintiffs,
a
grandfather
clause
alone
would
support
--
would
suffice
to
support
it.
these
considerations
are
impressive.
one
other
point
that
i
wish
to
make
and
then
i
conclude,
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
wisconsin
case
that
there's
something
unconstitutional
about
exempting
the
american
express
company
by
name
instead
of
by
a
set
of
standards
and
apparatus
such
that
although,
in
fact,
only
the
american
express
company
might
comply
with
it.
in
theory,
it
wouldn't
be
any
reason
why
you
or
i
couldn't
accept
that
we're
a
little
short
of
the
money
or
of
the
connections
in
foreign
countries
or
some
other
prerequisite.
it's
argued
that
there's
something
in
any
--
in
the
wisconsin
case,
there's
something
unconstitutional
about
exempting
the
american
express
company
by
name.
we
say
that
it
must
presumed
and
it
is
the
fact
that
at
the
present
time
there
is
in
fact
only
one
concern,
the
american
express
company
that
might
possibly
comply
with
these
standards,
that
if
the
time
ever
comes
when
these
plaintiffs
or
even
some
third
person
complies
with
the
standards
and
of
the
american
express
company
and
is
subject
to
the
act
where
the
american
express
company
is
exempt
because
of
its
name.
if
that
time
ever
comes,
which
it's
possible
to
conceive
but
difficult
to
believe,
the
--
that
will
be
the
time
to
say
that
a
question
of
discrimination
has
been
raised.
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
trial
court's
decision
in
this
case.
