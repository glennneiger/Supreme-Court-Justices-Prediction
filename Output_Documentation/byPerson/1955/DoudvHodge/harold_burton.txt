justice
harold
burton
but,
mr.
yowell
--
justice
harold
burton
--
in
that
mcdougall
case,
didn't
the
party
actually
raised
the
constitutionality
of
this
act
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
harold
burton
and
the
party
you
said
they
didn't
pass
that?
justice
harold
burton
well,
that's
a
double-headed
action
if
one
of
them
engaged
in
cashing
check
and
the
other
one
was
engaging
in
cashing
and
issuing.
justice
harold
burton
wouldn't
that
come
close
enough?
justice
harold
burton
mr.
yowell,
it
all
relates
to
the
merits
of
the
case
doesn't
it,
whether
or
not
the
injunction
should
issue
and
if
--
even
they
and
even
though
you
should
win
this
case
that's
to
go
back
to
that
court
for
the
determination
on
the
merits
that
they
never
heard.
justice
harold
burton
but
they
didn't
pass
on
it,
did
they?
they
--
they
limited
their
decision
to
the
jurist,
what
they
call
the
jurisdictional
points.
justice
harold
burton
they
didn't
pass
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
well,
i'm
under
the
impression.
i
maybe
wrong
about
it
that
they
talked
about
jurisdictions
and
said
they
didn't
have
a
jurisdiction,
and
therefore,
they
didn't
pass
(inaudible)
and
couldn't
pass
(inaudible)
justice
harold
burton
and
you'll
notice
that
if
the
case
is
reversed
that
where
to
pass
on
both
what
they
call
the
jurisdictional
point
and
the
merits
too.
justice
harold
burton
mr.
wines,
you're
taking
the
position
in
the
mcdougall
case,
did
passed
on
the
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
harold
burton
well
then,
on
that
theory,
why
would
it
not
be
appropriate
or
in
accordance
with
the
precedent
for
the
federal
court
to
require
them
to
pass
on
it
before
the
federal
court
does?
justice
harold
burton
they
should
--
justice
harold
burton
--
they
should
leave
it
open
to
the
--
justice
harold
burton
--
to
simply
pass
on.
justice
harold
burton
mr.
--
mr.
wines,
do
you
distinguish
to
wisconsin,
statute
from
this
statute?
justice
harold
burton
therefore,
you
disagree
with
the
federal
decision
on
this
--
on
this
subject.
