(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
pointed
out
that
this
is
--
the
point
you've
just
mentioned
is
the
distinction
between
your
case
and
the
other
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
the
difference
in
substance
--
in
substance
and
between
the
two
sections
in
your
case
or
the
one
that
which
we've
just
--
which
you've
just
mentioned
is
a
considerable
difference
between
the
two
sections
in
the
first
case.
so,
what
is
the
difference
in
substance
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
reference
to
these
two
sections?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what's
the
difference
in
substance
as
to
the
effect
on
the
projects?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
if
the
result
would
be
precisely
the
same
whether
you
proceed
in
your
case
under
one
of
the
two
sections
of
the
other
that
there's
no
greater
remedy
can
be
obtained,
no
quicker
remedy,
and
that
in
the
end,
the
end
result
would
be
the
same
in
both
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
205
and
206.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
the
other
one,
it
couldn't
--
it
couldn't
collect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
couldn't
bring
about
it
a
complete
change
after
the
proceeding
was
over
in
the
206?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
your
difference.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
difference
that
you
know
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
in
substance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
your
judgment
is
the
advantage
of
--
if
any
that
results
from
making
contacts
or
requiring
that
contracts
be
subjected
to
the
commission.
what
was
the
reason
the
congress
put
to
those
contracts
before
the
commission?was
it
--
were
they
--
they
have
any
weight
of
any
kind
and
if
so,
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
--
if
they
required
them
not
merely
to
be
filed
and
i'm
asking
you
because
i
want
to
view
them.
they
required
them
not
merely
to
be
filed,
but
they
provided
they
should
--
no
existing
contracts
when
the
act
was
passed,
no
contract
existing
should
be
changed
without
the
consent
of
the
commission,
was
that
right?
what
would
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
it
said
it
expressly.
i
thought
the
act
said
that
expressed
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
uses
the
words
without
prior
something
of
the
commission.
now
that
was
different,
but
there
was
any
provision
like
that
in
the
original
interstate
commerce
act
with
reference
to
existing
contracts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
they
did
here
intend
to
give
some
kind
of
weight
to
contract?
i
--
i
don't
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
exactly
what
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
--
i
had
to
puzzle
over
in
connection
with
the
pennsylvania
case
as
i
recall
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
sum
total
of
the
difference
then
in
result
the
way
it
comes
to
and
you
see
it
would
be.
now,
if
the
other
side
should
win
in
your
case,
that
interpretation
should
prevail.
companies
in
order
to
change
contract
could
not
get
the
advantage
of
them
until
after
a
hearing
and
judgment
by
the
commission.
but
if
you'll
take
your
position,
the
companies
could
get
the
advantage
of
the
rate
at
once,
but
subject
to
requirement
for
refund
if
they
eventually
lose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
sum
total
of
the
difference
in
these
two
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
if
the
contract
is
fully
of
no
effect
so
that
either
side
can
avoid
it
at
that
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
effect,
you
are
saying
that
the
contract
rates
are
the
same
though
the
commission
had
fixed
the
rates
in
the
beginning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
--
the
contract
to
fix
the
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
subject
to
change
either
in
the
way
you
say
or
the
way
he
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
view
does
--
your
view
does
not
care
with
your
argument.
it
does
not
care
whether
the
idea
that
the
company
--
and
go
away
with
the
--
with
its
contract
agreement
so
that
it's
--
it's
effective
at
once
and
until
and
such
time
that
the
commission
find
the
acts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
got
the
permission
to
ask
you
one
more
question
on
the
refund.
(inaudible)
it's
been
considerably
difficulty
frequently
in
refund
provisions
working.
sometimes,
they
don't
go
back
to
the
people
and
the
company
keeps
it.
what
is
the
refund
provision
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
you
would
have
lose
in
other
--
lose
in
other
words.
does
the
refund
provision
here
guarantee
that
you
have
to
refund
or
their
conditions
and
contentions
on
which
that
rests?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
keep
the
entire
refund
even
though
it
should
be
held
that
it
was
unreasonable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
i
asked
you
to
that
because
from
my
standpoint
that
enters
into
the
distinction
between
actions
under
the
two
provisions
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
--
then
i
won't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
ask
you
more
question.
are
there
any
differences
between
these
two
sections
outside
of
the
--
insofar
as
the
way
they
function,
what
they
do
to
your
company
or
the
others
or
in
general
except
what
has
been
mentioned
by
mr.
searls.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
doesn't
make
it
moot
then?
