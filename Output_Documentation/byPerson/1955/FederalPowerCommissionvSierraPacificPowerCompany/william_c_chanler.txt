mr.
william
c.
chanler
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
regarding
the
refund.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
if
we
are
correct
now
in
our
position,
this
filing
was
illegal.
we
have
been
paying
an
illegal
rate
and
of
course
we
get
it
back.
now,
the
fact
that
we
get
it
all
back
--
it's
been
running
a
long
time
is
not
due
to
the
provisions
of
the
act.
it's
due
to
the
error
of
the
commission
in
not
having
granted
our
petition
originally
to
reject
the
file.
it
has
then
entered
immediately
upon
a
hearing
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
contract
having
proceeded
erroneous
and
forced
us
to
pay
illegally.
of
course,
we'll
get
our
money
back.
that
(inaudible)
could
happen
if
they
have
act
in
--
as
i
think
they
should
correct
that.
now,
mr.
searls
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
was
very
surprised
--
i'm
very
surprised
to
hear
mr.
searls
say
that
there
could
be
only
one
rate
and
that
therefore,
there
was
no
difference.
it's
a
matter
of
record
in
this
case
conceding
that
pg&e
have
reasonable
rate
of
return
for
pg&e
on
its
elected
business
is
five
and
half
percent.
in
this
case,
pg&e
proposed
a
rate
in
excess
of
its
contract
but
still
producing
only
4.75%.
the
federal
power
commission
after
a
hearing
said,
"notwithstanding
the
fact
that
pg&e
has
concededly
entitled
the
five
and
half
percent,
they're
only
asking
for
4.75%
which
they
deemed
--
they're
willing
to
make
the
sacrifice
in
order
to
hold
the
business
against
competition."
therefore,
as
that
rate
is
neither
discriminatory
nor
preferential
and
pays
no
burden
on
the
stock
--
on
the
other
customers,
only
on
the
stockholders,
we
hold
the
4.75%
rate
reasonable.
now,
you
ask
me
what
difference
there
is
between
the
two
sections.
let
us
assume
for
a
minute
that
--
that
our
contract
produced
this
rate
of
4.75
that
we
now
know
has
been
found
reasonable
by
the
commission.
and
that
pg&e
was
filing
a
proposed
increase
giving
them
five
and
half
percent
which
is
stipulated
reasonable.
if
they
can
proceed
under
section
205
(b)
by
filing
the
proposed
increase
producing
a
rate
--
producing
only
five
and
half
percent,
the
commission
is
bound
under
everything
they've
said
under
the
language
of
the
act
to
approve
the
five
and
half
percent
rate
and
thereby
throw
out
our
contract
that
produces
concededly
reasonable
rate
of
4.75%
without
any
hearing
as
to
the
reasonableness
about
a
contract
rate.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
without
any
refund,
no
we're
out.
we're
out.
the
new
rate
goes
into
effect
and
our
contracts
out
of
the
window.
now,
take
it
the
other
way,
take
our
procedure.
the
rate
calling
for
an
increase
to
five
and
half
percent
is
filed
under
4
(d),
we
immediately
communicate
with
the
commission
and
say,
"look,
there's
a
filed
contracts
here
on
your
books,
filed
on
such
date,
it
calls
for
a
rate
producing
a
return
of
4.75%."
they
can't
legally
increase
that
rate
until
you've
looked
at
it
and
found
out
under
5
(a)
whether
the
rate
is
reasonable
and
the
contract
rate
is
the
only
legal
rate
until
that's
done.
the
commission
says,
"that's
right.
we
rejected
the
filing
and
then
proceeds
in
a
hearing,"
and
i
assume
its
bind
as
they
found
out
that
the
contract
rate
is
reasonable.
the
4.75
rate
is
reasonable.
why
is
there
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
these
two
sections?every
time
that
a
company
makes
any
rate,
a
special
rate
to
meet
competitions
that
is
less
than
the
--
produces
less
than
a
reasonable
return,
that
contract
is
of
no
value
whatever
under
their
theory
because
any
time
the
company
walked
right
in,
it
says,
"all
right,
the
competition
is
removed
now.
i'm
not
scared
of
it.
i'm
going
to
get
a
full
reasonable
rate."
mr.
william
c.
chanler
there
is
no
such
provision,
but
of
course,
the
commission
could
prevent
it.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no
sir.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
know
of
none,
i
don't
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
haven't
heard
of
any.
it's
not
been
suggested
but
i'm
sure
whether
on
many
cases
that
hold
and
of
course
if
that
happens,
if
it
is
found
that
the
rate
is
so
low
that
it
in
fact
hurt
the
economic
position
of
the
company.
of
course
then,
the
rate
must
be
set
aside
and
must
be
increased
contract
or
no
contact
because
the
commission
can't
allow
a
company
because
it
bound
itself
up
in
contracts
to
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
or
anyway
--
anyways
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no
sir,
i
don't
think
there
is.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh
well,
i
didn't
intimate
it
was.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
importance
of
contracts
in
the
electric
business
as
illustrated
by
the
record
in
this
case
which
i
think
will
meet
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
point.
in
--
at
page
28,
29
of
my
brief.
i
think
it
begins
at
page
27,
i
discussed
and
quote
from
testimony
given
before
the
california
commission
by
mr.
b.
b.
beckett,
the
chief
engineer
of
pg&e,
mr.
searls'
client.
at
that
time,
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
was
attempting
to
get
the
federal
power
commission
of
the
state
--
california
state
commission
to
authorize
a
regular
schedule
or
a
recognized
schedule
known
as
p-31
which
was
to
be
used
only
in
connection
with
contracts
for
five
years
or
more,
which
was
to
be
used
only
for
company's
sales
and
wholesale
for
re-sale
to
distributing
companies
to
meet
--
to
enable
the
distributing
companies
to
meet
competition,
then
threatening
because
of
the
shasta
dam
that
was
being
built
in
the
north
of
california.
mr.
beckett
began
by
pointing
out
ten
years
earlier
in
1936,
they
had
been
before
the
commission
and
got
in
a
similar
rate
known
as
p-30,
a
lower
rate
to
be
used
to
poster
the
threat
of
companies
and
localities
and
municipalities
building
their
own
steam
plants.
and
he
say's
now,
the
steam
plant
danger
is
gone.
it
cost
too
much
to
build
a
steam
plant
but
we've
this
threat
to
cheap
government
power
from
shasta.
and
he
said
when
he
was
asked
whether
he's
going
to
pay
the
full
pay
return?
no,
no,
then
that's
not
going
to
produce
any
full
pay
return
if
you
mean
by
that
the
normal
allocated
rate
of
return
that
we
use
in
rate
measure.
but
he
said,
"i
know
of
my
own
knowledge
that
it's
often
better
to
keep
business
and
to
lose
it."
and
if
the
incremental
return,
not
allocated,
exceeds
the
incremented
cost
so
that
we
lose
less
by
selling
at
this
low
rate
than
we
would
lose
if
we
lost
the
business
and
abandon
our
investment
in
it.
that's
that
for
the
company,
and
this
--
this
contract
is
a
p-31
contract.
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
they
said
to
him,
should
it
always
be
for
five
years
or
at
least
five
years
or
preferably
longer?
there
is
some
talk
here
especially
in
the
briefs
and
i
think
mr.
searls
suggested
that
it
never
was
intended
that
this
contract
should
be
minding
as
to
rates
for
each
term.
they
asked
mr.
beckett,
why
does
the
costumer
want
to
enter
such
a
contract?
so,
that
he
will
be
assured
of
the
low
rate
at
least
for
the
duration
of
the
contract.
now
there,
you
have
from
their
own
mouths
an
explanation
of
why
it's
important
to
set
the
company
to
enter
into
conference.
now,
they
entered
into
some
20
or
25
p-31
contracts
prior
to
the
time
they
began
abrogating
them
in
1952.
our
contract
was
entered
into
1948.
after
about
two
or
three
years
of
negotiation.
after
the
war
in
1946,
we
discovered
that
the
existing
distribution
system
over
the
mountains
of
being
inadequate
by
1952
or
1953,
we
needed
a
new
line,
and
we
badly
needed
lower
rates.
the
reason
we
needed
lower
rates,
spread
all
over
the
record
on
every
page
of
the
record,
was
that
the
people
of
nevada
whom
we
served
and
their
political
leaders
and
everybody
there
said,
"why
isn't
nevada
never
gotten
its
share
of
colorado
river
power.
well,
it
was
too
hard
to
bring
it
over
the
deadline
was
the
reason.
why
can't
we
get
shasta
power
instead?
and
so,
in
1946,
two
years
before
the
contract
was
entered
into,
we
went
to
them
and
we
said
we
need
a
new
line
and
we
need
cheaper
rates.
they
made
a
study
and
they
pointed
out
themselves
their
own
engineer.
it's
all
in
the
record.
they
said
they'd
better
--
we
better
think
of
giving
them
a
lower
rate
because
of
this
threat
of
competition.
but
they
didn't
do
it.
and
they
said
no,
we've
given
you
15-year
contract
at
the
same
rates
plus
an
escalator
clause
or
even
worse.
that
shows
that
this
rate
was
meant
to
be
binding
when
they
wanted
to
change
it.
they
put
in
an
escalator
clause
and
we
said
we
won't
have
an
escalator
clause
in
this
rate.
well,
for
a
year
after
that,
that
was
in
january
1947.
for
a
year,
we
debated
and
discussed
how
can
we
get
shasta
power,
government
power
of
some
kind
or
cheaper
power
somewhere.
it's
all
over
the
record
every
month.
their
own
president
advisory
committee
met
and
said,
how
soon
are
we
going
to
get
somewhere
with
sierra?
oh,
sierra
can't
--
won't
talk
to
us.
they
are
dealing
with
the
government.
and
finally,
in
august
of
1947,
the
bureau
of
reclamation
wrote
to
sierra
and
said
how
--
to
pg&e
and
said
we've
been
approached
by
these
nevada
people,
how
about
your
winning
shasta
power
into
nevada?
of
course,
they
didn't
like
that
a
bit.
so,
they've
got
together
and
they
said,
guys
we've
got
to
do
something
about
this.
how
about
offering
them
p-31
say's
the
president
of
pg&e.
and
then,
the
vice
president
now
president,
mr.
sutherland
said,
“well
we
hadn't
considered
it
while
you
thought
of
it.
we
make
a
study
of
it.”
he
and
mr.
beckett
make
a
study
which
is
in
the
record.
we
found
in
the
last
minute
of
the
hearing
so
that
it's
not
very
well
presented.
there's
no
testimony
about
it
that
it
was
there
all
right.
the
present
president
mr.
sutherland
and
the
chief
rate
engineer
made
a
study
on
the
incremental
cost
versus
the
incremental
return
that
they
would
get
first
by
willing
then
by
buying
shasta
power
under
their
own
contract
and
not
--
and
then
selling
their
power
to
us
under
p-31,
they
said
why
it's
for
us.
it's
just
about
the
same.
we
make
more
money
and
we
won't
get
into
trouble
by
willing
government
power
will
offer
investment.
they
also
discussed
the
line
over
the
mountains
and
said
that
was
uneconomical
all
over.
it
also
appears
in
the
record
that
even
after
the
brief
was
entered
into,
sierra
said,
can't
we
have
this
contract
cancelable
by
us
if
we
can
still
get
government
power.
well,
perhaps
how
the
contract
was
entered
into
they've
now
contend
and
even
the
commission
contends
there
wasn't
much
competition
to
it,
and
just
(inaudible)
this
competition.
they
went
before
the
federal
--
california
commission
the
next
year
for
an
increase
and
said,
now
of
course
we've
got
this
25
--
22
contracts
including
sierra,
entered
into
to
meet
competition.
we
don't
want
to
increase
those
mr.
searls'
predecessor
then
general
counsel
of
pg&e
said,”
well,
we've
just
entered
into
these
contracts.
anyone
who
would
accuse
us
of
double
dot
dealing
repudiation
if
we
should
--
now,
i
ask
for
an
increase,
and
i
think
anyone
would
and
i
think
anyone
now
does
as
myself.
well,
at
that
time
of
course,
they
were
still
in
that
side
of
competition.
but
in
1953,
they
had
entered
into
their
own
agreement
with
shasta.the
--
some
question
in
the
facts
exactly
as
to
whether
they
did
it
or
whether
the
bureau
did
it.
they
entered
into
a
wheeling
agreement
with
the
bureau
whereby
they
would
wheel
all
the
power
of
the
bureau
wanted
to
wheel
within
an
area
which
excluded
sierra.
and
then,
they've
entered
into
another
agreement
whereby
they
had
wheel
290,000
kilowatts
for
shasta
power
into
the
city
of
sacramento.
so,
that
the
sacramento
municipal
district,
there
was
no
longer
any
shasta
power
we
could
get
even
if
we
could
bring
it
over
the
mountains.
what
did
they
do
then?
they
proceeded
as
to
increase
all
their
rates
except
the
city
of
redding.
they
said
redding
is
right
at
the
shasta
dam.
they
still
got
a
competitive
position.
we
don't
want
to
touch
their
rate,
but
that's
increased
all
of
the
others.
california
commission
said,
“no
you
don't.
we
know
how
you
entered
into
these
contracts
and
you
came
here
and
asked
us
for
the
right
to
make
this
little
rate
contracts
for
periods
of
years
to
meet
competition,
and
you've
got
to
live
up
to
them
and
unless
you
can
get
renegotiations."
i
should
bring
out
because
there's
much
about
it
in
the
--
in
the
briefs.
after
the
contract
was
entered
into,
we
--
it
had
to
be
approved
by
the
california
commission.
at
the
hearings
before
the
california
commission,
all
the
nevada
people
came
storming
into
the
hearing
room
and
said
we
don't
like
this.
we
still
want
shasta
power,
and
the
president
of
sierra
and
his
engineer
tried
to
back
up
the
contract
and
they
said
why
it
would
take
him
too
long
to
build
the
line
over
the
mountains.
we
couldn't
meet
our
peak
in
53
and
54
if
we
use
shasta
power.
although
the
rate
would
be
cheaper,
the
rate
quoted
by
the
government
would
be
cheaper
than
the
rate
under
the
contract.
it's
more
practical
to
accept
this
contract
because
they
couldn't
deliver
in
time.
the
commission
claims
that
shows
we
couldn't
ever
have
dealt
with
shasta
at
all.
well,
of
course
you
can
forego
a
peak
for
a
winter
by
not
taking
on
more
loads,
if
you
can
get
much
cheaper
power.
that's
what
the
engineer
stated
at
the
time
in
any
event.
so
that's
why
this
contract
--
(inaudible)
interrupt
me.
that's
why
this
contract
was
entered
into.
it
stands
all
over
the
record.
the
only
thing
i'm
surprised
at
is
why
an
attempt
was
made
to
prove
it
isn't
so
or
why
anybody
contends
it
isn't
so.
i
was
glad
that
mr.
fletcher
conceded
of
course
that
they
entered
into
their
contracts
in
good
faith
and
telling
them
to
be
binding
and
insert
the
evidence
that
these
were
intended
and
binding.
however,
and
they
so
swore
repeatedly
before
the
state
commission.
they
said
this
was
done
to
meet
competition
and
that's
why
we
did
it.
now,
they
say,
oh
nonsense.
it's
all
nonsense.
we
want
to
get
out
of
it
and
they
raised
all
these
questions.
now,
at
the
hearing,
as
i
say,
we
maintained
the
because
of
these
reasons,
in
any
event.
the
federal
commission
followed
california
commission
but
didn't
go
into
the
legal
question
so
much.
they
just
said
we're
going
to
make
to
lift
the
contract
with
--
two
commissioners
did
that
and
that's
after
we
lost
our
attempt
to
have
them
reject
the
file
on
the
matter
of
law.
the
commission
beat
us
on
the
matter
of
law
right
away.
they
said
no
we
don't
pay
any
attention
to
the
contract.
but
you
may
raise
your
contentions
at
the
hearing.
so,
we
went
into
the
hearing
and
the
hope
as
i
say
persuading
to
them
but
under
the
state
of
facts,
they
--
they
did
not
accept
the
contract.
but,
they
didn't.
three
commissioners
said
that
we
have
the
facts
wrong
or
something.
the
other
two
stood
by
us.
they
also
said
because
the
contract
didn't
mean
anything.
and
then
they
said
as
much
as
made
to
this
by
mr.
searls
and
his
brief.
we
may
point
out
that
if
a
finding
on
the
lawfulness
of
the
1948
contract
rate
were
necessary,
or
appropriate
on
the
record
before
us,
that
finding
would
have
to
be
that
the
1948
rate
is
unreasonably
low
and
therefore
unlawful.
they
went
on.
none
of
the
evidence
in
this
record
warrants
a
finding
that
any
rate
would
be
reasonable,
that
would
produce
a
return
substantially
less
than
the
4.75%
resulting
from
the
proposed
rate
which
is
the
minimum,
pg&e
is
willing
to
accept.
well,
it
so
says
that
that's
a
finding
and
of
course
it
isn't.
they
said
if
it
were
necessary,
it
would
make
a
finding.
that's
not
the
finding.
they
said
the
finding
was
not
necessary
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
contract.
if
the
finding
were
necessary,
the
finding
may
propose
to
make
there,
would
have
to
be
set
aside
by
the
courts
because
it's
perfectly
well
established
that
a
contract
can't
be
set
aside
just
because
it's
more
burdensome
on
one
party
than
another,
or
because
it
is
harmful
to
the
company's
stockholders,
it
must
be
harmful
to
the
company
itself
or
to
the
public.
it
must
either
be
discriminatory
or
preferential
or
exorbitantly
high
or
the
burden
must
be
thrown
on
other
consumers
or
it
must
injure
the
company
from
performing
its
services.
well,
and
mr.
wahrenbrock
in
the
--
before
the
commission
conceded
that
they
none
of
those
things,
he
says
well
if
first
he
was
here
--
he
was
defending
the
4.75
rate
before
the
commission.
well,
if
pg&e
is
willing
to
serve
one
costumer
less
than
to
pay
return
on
that
business,
and
earn
only
a
fair
return
on
all
the
other
costumers
which
is
the
situation
here
because
the
stockholders
have
solved
the
loss.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
other
costumers
are
not
the
victims
of
an
undue
discrimination
because
they
are
getting
all
that
the
law
entitles
into
in
any
event.
they're
paying
only
a
reasonable
return
on
the
business
to
them.
isn't
that
the
situation
here?
mr.
wahrenbrock,
after
a
little
more
exchange,
yes,
that
is
right.
of
course
it
is
the
situation
under
the
contract.
it's
been
the
situation
right
or
wrong
under
the
contract
and
made
it
conceded.
i
forgot
to
point
out
that
when
the
california
commission
approved
the
p-31
schedule
and
again
when
it
expressly
approved
this
contract,
it
made
the
condition,
asked
pg&e
to
agree
to
the
condition.
the
pg&e
of
course
had
to
agree
that
in
fixing
its
rates
to
its
other
costumers,
the
other
costumers
will
not
be
made
to
bear
any
higher
rate
because
of
the
lower
rate
with
which
they
were
serving
sierra
that
the
loss
of
this
business
would
fall
solely
on
the
stockholders.
and
that
of
course
was
agreed
to,
the
management
did
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
stockholders
because
they
thought
it
was
better
to
keep
this
business
at
the
lower
rate
than
to
lose
several
million
dollars
of
investment
to
building
lines
over
the
sierra
summit.
that
was
the
reason.
it
said
it
over
and
over
that
that
was
the
reason.
he
swore
to
it
under
oath.
he
tried
to
deny
it
in
this
proceeding.
again,
mr.
wahrenbrock
said
in
his
brief,
the
only
question
would
seem
to
be
whether
in
determining
what
is
a
fair
return
for
this
business?
pg&e
should
be
held
bound
by
the
representations
and
agreements.
it
made
in
1948
as
to
a
satisfactory
return
for
the
term
of
its
agreement.
in
other
words,
should
they
be
bound
by
this
contract?
under
the
rate
regulation
practices
heretofore
followed
by
the
california
commission,
mr.
wahrenbrock's
position
and
by
this
commission,
no
costumer
--
no
other
costumer
of
pg&e
will
bear
any
greater
burden,
if
pg&e
is
held
to
its
1948
representations.
and
the
california
commission
has
held
that
it
should
be.
he
points
out
that
california
commission
also
refused
to
let
them
increase
their
rates.
but
he
then
goes
on
and
says
the
fact
that
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
pg&e's
business
is
involved
in
this
contract,
and
therefore,
it
doesn't
hurt
pg&e's
--
i'm
reading
footnote
on
page
45
of
my
brief
now.
i'm
sorry.
i'll
tell
you
where
it
was.
he
says
that
the
fact
that
in
this
instance,
no
harm
is
done
to
anybody
because
it's
a
small
part
of
the
company's
business,
still
affects
the
question
of
principle
that
if
pg&e
entered
into
a
great
many
contracts,
it
might
hurt
itself
economically
and
that
would
be
bad.
well,
i
agree
of
course.
as
soon
as
that
happens,
the
commission
will
come
in
and
set
aside
the
contracts.
but
here,
it's
on
the
record
and
this
case
was
so
advocated
by
everybody
that
nobody
but
the
stockholders
of
pg&e
are
hurt
when
(inaudible)
by
our
contract
even
though
the
contract
produces
only
2.6%.
the
commission
was
correct
when
it
accepted
the
4.75
rate
proposed
by
the
company
absent
of
the
contract.
assuming
there
was
no
contract,
for
the
avowed
reason
that
that
was
the
lowest
rate
that
company
was
willing
to
serve
at.
i
think
it's
the
duty
of
the
commission
to
obtain
the
lowest
available
rate
for
it's
--
for
the
costumers
in
the
business
provided
the
rate
is
not
so
low,
as
to
hurt
anyone
or
a
discriminatory.
the
difference
is,
the
commission
forgot
when
it
said
the
4.75
was
the
lowest
rate.
pg&e
was
willing
to
service
that,
but
in
1948,
they'd
agreed
to
service
at
the
lower
rate
for
15
years.
because
they
all
say
that
was
in
the
contract,
who
cares
about
a
contract.
they
don't
exist
anymore
but
i
think
they
do.
i
think
this
court
knows
they
do
and
i
think
congress
knows
they
do
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
so
held.
so,
that
i
believe
that
i'm
convinced
that
if
this
had
been
a
hearing
under
206
instead
of
under
205,
the
commission
would
have
had
to
find
out
contract
rate
reasonable.
the
commission
isn't
there
as
the
guardian
of
the
stockholders
of
utility
companies,
if
the
management
makes
the
contract
for
a
good
business
reason
to
hold
a
business
against
competition
then
later,
the
competition
is
removed.
it
isn't
up
to
the
commission
to
say
now,
you
can
get
out
of
your
contract
unless
somebody
is
being
hurt
by
it.
the
management
is
the
guardian
of
the
contract,
of
its
stockholders
and
the
commission
is
looking
after
the
public.
and
the
only
public
is
going
to
suffer
here
are
the
consumers
in
the
state
of
nevada
whose
rates
will
be
--
have
to
be
increased
if
this
continues,
and
there
is
no
refund.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
they
would
have
found
it
was
too
low
and
therefore
unreasonable
and
went
on
and
said
that
the
4.75
rate
was
the
lowest
rate
the
company
was
willing
to
serve
at.
now,
i'm
assuming
by
that
that
the
commission
correct.
it
was
taking
to
position
which
i
think
is
the
right
position
that
a
company's
responsive
rate,
a
company
proposed
rate
will
be
accepted
by
the
commission
even
though
it
produces
less
than
a
full
return
if
it
is
done
for
a
reasonable
purpose
and
doesn't
hurt
anybody.
if
it's
done
to
meet
competition
or
for
whatever
reason
the
management
may
think
a
good
one
to
meet
what
they
think
is
competition,
i
think
their
argument
is
that
--
we
couldn't
have
gotten
shasta
anyhow,
but
anyway,
pg&e
thought
we
could,
they
wanted
to
keep
us
out
and
they
did
keep
shasta
out.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
commission
should
increase
such
a
rate
unless
it
is
found
that
the
public
interest
is
hurt
by
the
low
rate
contract.
and
therefore,
if
the
commission
is
told
that
the
contract
is
binding
unless
the
contract
is
found
against
the
public
interest,
then
of
course
it
is
evident
that
pg&e
has
agreed
to
serve
the
contract
rate
from
the
duration
of
the
contract.
that
becomes
the
lowest
rate
at
which
they
are
willing
to
serve,
and
i
think
on
the
record
in
this
case
and
in
the
like
of
many
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
the
courts,
that
rate
would
have
to
be
--
will
have
to
be
sustained.
now,
on
this
question
of
a
rate
being
low,
i
should
like
to
read
briefly
to
your
honors
a
decision
of
--
from
an
opinion
in
this
court,
in
a
case
involving
this
very
problem
whether
a
contract
had
to
be
increased
because
the
rate
was
too
low
--
where
is
that
arkansas
case.
i
lost
my
note
on
it.
all
right
now,
here's
the
arkansas
case,
i
had
its
map
here
because
my
map
has
moved.
i'll
find
it.
it's
in
my
brief.
there,
the
question
was
the
company
said
that
the
commission,
the
state
commission
i
think
it
was,
must
reduce
a
rate
because
it
falls
too
heavily
on
the
company.
and
this
court
said
--
it
is
at
page
41
of
my
brief
--
there
was
a
contract
that
forbade
on
(inaudible)
forbade
contracts
from
being
upset
in
arkansas
so
the
court
said
of
course
that
settles
it
but
says
the
court,
the
question
whether
in
the
--
this
court
in
this
case
261
u.s.,
the
question
whether
in
the
absence
of
statute
it'd
be
made
to
appear
that
the
stipulated
consideration
was
grossly
inadequate,
the
commission
under
the
circumstances
disclosed
by
the
record
would
have
been
under
a
duty
to
fix
state
rates
in
contravention
of
the
contracts
may
be
put
aside
with
great
consideration.
while
the
state
may
exercise
its
legislative
power
to
regulate
public
utility
--
utilities
and
fixed
rates,
not
withstanding
the
affect
may
be
to
modify
or
abrogate
private
contracts.
there
is
quite
clearly
no
principle
which
imposes
an
obligation
to
do
so,
merely
to
relieve
a
contracting
party
from
the
burdens
of
an
improvident
undertaking,
the
power
to
fix
rates
when
exerted
is
for
the
public
welfare
to
which
private
contracts
must
yield,
but
it
is
not
an
independent
legislative
function
to
vary
or
set
aside
to
its
contracts,
however,
unwise
and
unprofitable
they
may
be.
indeed,
the
exertion
of
legislative
power
surely
to
that
--
solely
to
that
in
is
precluded
by
the
contract
in
(inaudible)
clause.
the
power
does
not
exist
per
se,
it
is
the
intervention
of
the
public
interest
which
justifies
(inaudible)
mr.
wahrenbrock's
reference
to
state
decisions
and
i
think
he
has
10
states
on
his
side
and
my
brief,
i
bring
out
i
think
we
have
10
on
ours
and
don't
think
he's
earned
the
point.
i
won't
go
into
that.
the
state
cases
are
usually
on
slightly
different
contract
--
types
of
statutes.
there
are
many
state
cases
that
stand
exactly
for
the
proposition
that
we
advanced
here,
some
don't,
but
i
would
just
like
to
read
from
a
recent
decision
of
the
state
commission
of
the
state
of
indiana
which
has
just
come
to
my
attention
in
the
--
the
most
recent
state
decision
on
this
matter
in
the
commerce
clearing
house.
it's
a
matter
of
northern
indiana
public
service
company,
there,
the
united
states
steel
company
brought
what
would
be
a
5
(a)
proceeding
under
our
act
to
have
a
statute
--
a
contract
set
aside
because
the
rate
was
too
high,
it
was
bind
from
the
electric
light
company.
it
was
a
purchaser.
and
it
entered
into
a
15-year
contract
with
a
local
electric
company.
it
said
it's
too
high.
and
we'd
like
to
set
aside
in
the
state
commission,
although
state
commission's
pay
no
attention
to
contracts,
said,
such
a
contract
is
subject
to
the
police
power
of
the
state.
the
power
of
interference
of
contracts
is
however
an
extra
ordinary
power
and
should
not,
and
should
therefore
be
sparingly
exercised
and
only
on
the
clear
and
unmistakable
ground
that
the
welfare
of
the
general
public
demands
it.
in
our
opinion,
the
fact
that
the
terms
of
the
contract
there
are
heavily
on
one
party
or
the
other
is
not
at
of
itself,
sufficient
to
one
of
this
interference
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
the
general
public
welfare
is
involved.
the
contract
between
competent
and
independent
parties
should
not
be
interfered
with
by
regulatory
party
except
for
adequate
and
compelling
reasons
of
public
interest.
several
state
commissions
have
expressed
these
views
in
clear
and
concise
language
starting
particularly
in
a
decision
from
the
state
of
connecticut.
so
i
had
connecticut
and
indiana
to
my
list
of
the
parties.
i
don't
think
this
is
a
baseball
game
and
we're
going
to
win
by
10
to
8
on
the
state
cases
however.
it
is
true
that
states,
i
think,
mostly
go
along
with
the
view
that
i
have
advanced
but
three
or
four
of
them
have
taken
precisely
the
opposite
view.
mr.
wahrenbrock
bears
with
great
confidence
in
the
midland
realty
case.
i
think
the
midland
realty
case
when
you
read
what
this
court
said
and
what
the
state
court
said
is
clearly
distinguishable,
this
court
stated
that
it
was
bound
--
these
questions,
i'm
reading
from
page
45
of
my
brief,
are
to
be
decided
upon
the
construction
that
the
state
supreme
court
put
up
on
the
statute,
and
that
law
is
to
be
taken
as
if
it
declared
that
rates
made
in
accordance
with
its
provisions
shall
supersede
all
existing
contract
rates.
now
that's
a
little
blind
until
you
go
and
look
at
the
state
court's
decision.
you
there
find
in
the
two
state
court
decision
cited
by
this
court,
and
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
held
first
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
because
of
our
own
peculiar
constitutional
provision,
all
existing
rate
contracts
are
outlawed
here
since
the
passage
of
the
regulatory
statute.
the
point
was
the
commission
--
the
constitution
of
missouri
was
amended,
i
think
way
back
in
1873,
by
adding
a
provision
that
the
police
power
may
never
be
bridge,
and
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
thought
that
that
gave
a
police
power
greater
sanctity
than
it
has
anyhow,
and
that
when
a
regulatory
statute
was
passed,
any
contract
would
violate
the
police
power,
and
that
that
is
why
they
so
held
is
apparent
because
a
month
after
the
--
they
decided
that
(inaudible)
case,
they
decided
the
(inaudible)
case
at
which
they
overruled
some
of
their
prior
decisions
which
had
held
contracts
were
valid.
it
refused
to
overrule
one
which
had
so
held
before
the
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
wahrenbrock
says
that
that's
all
nonsense,
what
the
police
power
got
two
with
it.
well,
i'm
not
here
to
criticize
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
that's
what
they
said
was
the
reason
for
it.
and
the
only
reason
for
it
and
because
of
it,
they
said
that
there
can't
be
any
contracts
in
the
utility
business
in
state
of
missouri
and
that's
all
this
court
upheld
in
the
midland
case.
they
said
of
course
if
the
state
says,
so
that's
it,
and
there's
no
doubt
about
it,
we
--
this
court
so
held
in
the
railroad
business.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes
sir?
mr.
william
c.
chanler
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
view
in
this
matter,
and
if
the
court
in
its
opinion
alludes
to
the
fact
that
is
referred
to
in
my
brief,
if
it
wished
to
agree
with
it,
but
you
can't
set
aside
the
contract
simply
because
it's
low.
you
got
to
show
its
against
the
public
interest,
i
don't
know
why
the
commission
would
enter
into
--
another
hearing
because
i
think
it
would
realize
from
the
record
now
before
it
that
our
contract
is
not
against
the
public
interest.
but
as
presently
minded,
i
know
from
what
i've
heard.
i'm
sure
mr.
wahrenbrock
will
agree
with
me.
if
it
was
sent
back
to
the
commission,
the
commission
would
say
if
it
was
allowed
to
say
so,
on
this
record,
we
think
it's
against
the
public
interest.
i
would
then
have
to
go
to
court
and
say
why?
what
everything
says
is
that
the
public
interest
is
injured.
if
it
goes
back
--
well
if
the
court
below
is
affirmed,
the
court
below
said
--
oh
yes
that's
the
part
that
does
require
a
discussion.
the
court
below
in
its
original
opinion
ordered
this
case
return
to
the
commission
without
prejudice
to
further
proceedings
under
or
--
for
further
proceedings
under
206
(a)
if
the
commission
decide
to
have
such
further
proceedings.
i
made
a
motion
to
the
court
asking
to
change
that,
because
i
said,
according
to
the
commission's
opinion
here,
all
they'll
do
--
they'll
say,
we
now
say
that
the
contract
is
bad
and
it's
always
been
bad
and
validate
the
rate
nunc
pro
tunc
as
the
date
of
the
illegal
filing.
and
i
say
this
as
you
agree
with
us,
the
filing
was
illegal,
the
contract
has
been
the
illegal
rate
until
it
set
aside
and
the
commission
cannot
act
retroactively.
it
must
first
find
the
contract
unreasonable
and
then
set
it
aside
as
to
the
future.
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
a
very
strong
opposition
from
my
friends
here
who
contended
that
of
course
they
should
get
--
they
should
keep
their
money,
amended
its
order
so
as
to
provide
that
--
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
federal
power
commission
with
a
direction
to
dismiss
the
five
--
the
205
proceeding.
on
the
ground
with
that
under
its
opinion
was
illegally
undertaken
and
should
have
been
rejected
when
we
so
moved
in
the
beginning
without
prejudice
to
the
right
of
the
commission
to
initiate
a
new
proceeding
under
206
(a).
now,
i
think
that's
what
i
have
suggested
they
should
do.
i'm
not
certain
now,
but
i
notice
in
the
briefs
of
my
friends
here,
they
say
that
that
would
mean
--
that
we'd
have
to
begin
all
over
again
at
the
beginning,
and
i
didn't
mean
that.
we've
got
a
voluminous
record
of
15
volumes
i
think
which
all
their
cost
are
in
and
may
be
one
of
two
things
that
we
want
to
bring
out
and
perhaps
we
want
to
put
in
evidence
to
show
that
although
it's
a
matter
of
common
knowledge,
that
they're
not
having
any
difficulty
selling
securities
or
anything
of
that
kind
and
that
this
contract
doesn't
intervene
in
any
way.
but
otherwise,
there'd
be
no
objection
of
course
to
the
court
proceeding
prospectively
on
this
record
plus
other
additional
evidence
anyone
may
want
to
put
in
and
so
i
in
my
brief
have
suggested
that
perhaps
the
order
should
be
amended
further,
perhaps
i
wasn't
quite
right
what
i
suggested
below
that
they
should
dismiss
the
205
proceeding
without
prejudice
to
further
continuing
proceedings
under
206
(a).
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
don't
know
whether
the
commission
would
have
thought
it
was
proceeding
under
both
205
and
206
when
it
held
this
hearing,
it
may
have.
i
know
it
doesn't
say
so,
they're
a
little
vague
about
that,
but
i
would
have
no
objection
to
that
at
all,
no
point
beginning
at
the
beginning.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
in
this
one,
there
is
at
present
and
i
think
close
to
a
million
dollars
about
$900,000.
in
the
other
one
i
think,
it's
about
$150,000
or
$200,000
in
the
mobile
case.
and
this
one
of
course
had
the
long
time
to
run
that
money
involved
as
to
the
future
as
long
as
the
contract
is
not
unreasonable.
now,
on
the
question
i
was
talking
very
briefly
about
the
cases,
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
cases.
i
don't
think
that's
how
this
case
is
going
to
be
decided,
but
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
asked
also
about
the
practice
that
the
commission
and
the
cases
effects
somewhat
on
that.
as
i've
said,
there
are
many
state
commissions
and
many
state
cases
that
show
they
have
followed
in
general
the
practice
that
we
advocate,
and
the
commission
to
my
knowledge
in
anything
that's
been
presented
here
has
never
once
permitted
a
contract
rate
to
be
increased
over
the
objection
of
the
other
party
under
a
proceeding
of
this
kind
until
the
two
cases
now
before
the
court.
and
there
is
a
suggestion
that's
been
made
to
the
contrary
has
been
disapproved,
and
i
don't
think
they
are
even
making
them
anymore.
they
did
it
one
time
and
say
they
did
it
all
the
time.
i
think
in
the
other
case
i
showed
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
are
disposed
of
their
argument
regarding
the
panhandle
litigation.
the
fact
that
the
commission
itself
recognizes
great
contracts
as
valid
and
that
--
also
united
gas
recognizes
contracts
as
continuing
to
be
valid
despite
all
the
storm.
mr.
fletcher
told
us
he
thought
the
contract
went
right
out
the
window.
do
you
remember
we
have
three
views
here?
mr.
fletcher
says
contracts
had
gone
all
together,
under
the
act.
mr.
wahrenbrock
says
no,
the
act
recognizes
contracts
but
the
company
can
change
them
anytime
they
like.
mr.
searls,
as
i
understand
it
says,
there
can
be
only
one
rate,
and
that's
the
commission
rate
and
i
think
from
there,
reargues
therefore
there
can't
be
a
contract.
how
do
i
say,
there
are
two
rates
writing
its
own
case.
now,
here
is
a
very
interesting
case,
mr.
fletcher's
client
had
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
isn't
it
that
these
contracts
so
long
as
they're
reasonable
are
good
contracts?
that's
my
position.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no
sir.
they
say
the
contract
is
only
good
until
the
other
side
puts
out
another
reasonable
rate
without
any
finding
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
our
contract
at
all.
mr.
searls
says
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no.
well,
no.
on
the
first
case,
they
took
over
the
contract
by
assignment.
they
are
now
serving
our
costumer
directly
and
paying
as
more
for
it
than
we
were
getting
before.
why
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
their
contract,
as
i
say
i
don't
know
except
that
i've
pointed
out
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
that
question,
well
suggested,
we
all
agreed
among
each
other
that
we
didn't
think
it
made
it
moot
because
i've
got
$140,000
i
want
to
get
back
or
more
from
my
client.
so,
if
it
doesn't
really
make
it
moot
but
there
was
--
we
also
stipulated
that
it
would
have
no
effect
on
this
when
they
--
they
offered
it
to
all
their
costumers
and
of
course
we
were
losing
an
awful
lot
of
money
and
we
didn't
know
how
long
this
case
would
go
on,
so
that
my
client
wanted
to
stop
the
loss
of
money.
oh,
mr.
fletcher
said
why
didn't
we
go
and
ask
for
increase
rates
in
alabama?
and
he
says
that
something
about
who
you're
making
too
much
money.
well
mr.
--
the
defendant
(inaudible)
company
who
was
here
then
and
alleged,
asked
me
to
point
out
to
the
court.
he's
the
one
who
advised
the
person
of
the
company.
he
said
he
didn't
want
him
to
go
before
the
alabama
committee
because
--
commission
because
he
believed
his
contract
for
resale
of
that
gas
was
a
valid
and
binding
contract.
that's
what
he
did.
but
here
is
the
case,
decided
last
month,
united
gas
pipe
line
company
v.
federal
power
commission,
220
f.2d
206,
it's
referred
to
in
a
footnote
on
my
sierra
brief.
i
didn't
know
of
it
when
i
wrote
to
mobile
brief,
in
which
united
gas
pipe
line
got
into
a
controversy
with
mississippi
river
fuel
corporation
is
only
frequently
as
in
litigation,
over
the
proper
rate
that
it
had
a
right
to
charge
mississippi
under
its
existing
rate
contract,
(inaudible).
the
rate
was
a
very
complicated
one,
it
depended
of
the
source
of
power,
and
there
was
to
be
an
adjustment
and
a
refund.
and
mississippi
went
to
the
commission
or
to
the
court,
i
guess,
i
don't
know
if
it
went
to
commission
and
said
--
they
went
before
the
commission
first
at
one
time
and
said
that
they
had
not
received
the
proper
refunds
and
they'd
been
over
charged.mr.
fletcher
didn't
file
or
didn't
say
well,
what's
a
recontract?
he
went
before
the
commission
and
then
before
the
court
and
said,
“this
contract,
as
i
interpret
it,
entitles
me
to
the
higher
rate
i
was
collecting
in
accordance
with
the
contract.”
the
commission
said,
“no,
the
contract
provides
the
lower
rate
and
we
order
you
to
carry
out
your
contract
and
refund
$2
million
to
mississippi
river
fuel
company.”
and
it
falls
to
contract,
the
rate
contract,
the
fuels
(inaudible)
went
up
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
only
question
involved
here
of
course
is
a
construction
of
the
contracts,
the
contract
provides
as
the
court
below
said
and
we
enforced
it.
and
this
court,
oh
yes,
i
know
how
it
brought
to
my
attention
now.
this
court
a
month
ago,
or
few
weeks
ago
denied
certiorari.
and
when
i
saw
that,
i
was
interested
in
what
it
said
about
the
facts
and
looked
up
the
case
and
i
quite
naturally
--
they
shouldn't
have
taken
certiorari
in
such
case.
it's
just
a
question
of
construction
of
a
contract.
but
my
point
is
that
everybody
concerned
recognized
a
valid
contract
to
sell
in
either
a
--
either
30
cents
or
20
cents
whatever
it
was.
and
they
went
also
to
court
to
find
and
figure
which
rate
was
right
and
here
they
come
in
and
say,
all
contracts
don't
count
at
all
in
this
business.
now,
i
think
by
the
time
your
honors
are
through
looking
at
the
discussion
of
the
cases
in
the
briefs,
you
will
see
that
there
isn't
the
slightest
doubt,
that
contracts
are
and
must
be
recognized
in
this
business,
and
of
course
if
they
can
be
abrogated
by
any
such
method
as
that
advocated
here,
they
might
as
well
say
there
are
no
contract
because
they
don't
exist.
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
asked
mr.
wahrenbrock
how
the
commission
would
proceed
if
my
view
were
accepted.
i
wasn't
quite
clear
as
to
what
his
answer
was
but
it
seems
to
me
very
simple.
the
commission
can
amend
its
rules.
all
these
contracts
were
on
file
in
the
first
place.
and
one
thing
they
can
do
is
to
have
a
clerk
go
up
and
see
when
somebody
files
an
increase
whether
the
rate
being
increased
is
embodied
in
the
contract,
but
that's
to
come
as
soon
they
can
say
state
in
every
increase
whether
any
part
of
this
rate
is
involved
in
the
contract
and
if
so
who
the
other
party
is,
and
then
they
notify
the
other
party
and
the
party
said
we
didn't
agree
to
this
or
we
did
agree
to
it.
if
they
agreed
to
it,
it
goes
ahead
like
any
other
rate
increase
(inaudible).
if
it
didn't
agree
to
what
the
commission
must
reject
it
and
then
say,
if
he
wants
to,
we
want
to
look
at
this
contract.
and
one
other
point
that's
been
discussed
here
that
i
forgotten
to
raise
now
is
to
--
the
company
can't
ask
the
commission
to
review
its
own
contract.
it
definitely
cannot
under
the
gas
act,
because
the
gas
act
lists
the
parties
that
may
bring
a
proceeding
under
section
5
(a),
under
the
power
act,
it
merely
says
on
complaint,
mr.
wahrenbrock
says
he
construes
that
to
mean
that
the
company
couldn't
complain
about
its
own
rate.
i
don't
know
whether
it
could
or
not.
but
this
power
of
government
to
abrogate
contract
isn't
made
for
the
benefit
of
the
parties
of
the
contract.
it
doesn't
exist
to
enable
people
to
get
out
of
the
contract
that
hurts
them.it
exists
for
the
public
welfare
and
the
public
welfare
alone.
and
congress
recognized
that.
they
said
the
representatives
of
the
public
who
may
be
injured
by
the
contract,
they're
the
ones
who
may
complain
under
5
(a).
a
local
distributing
company
on
behalf
of
its
costumers,
a
state
commission
looking
after
all
the
people
in
the
state
if
there
is
a
discrimination,
if
there's
an
undue
preference.
if
the
rate
is
too
high.
if
the
service
is
inadequate
because
the
company
is
too
poor,
if
the
company
isn't
able
to
deliver
service,
all
those
are
going
to
be
taken
cared
of
by
the
representatives
of
the
consumer,
and
of
course
it's
the
state
commission,
and
other
representative
of
the
consumers
and
to
local
distributing
companies,
and
they
have
power
to
initiate
a
procedure.
nobody
can
stop
mr.
searls'
client
from
writing
a
letter
to
the
federal
power
commission
in
saying
we're
being
(inaudible)
by
this
contract.
it
involves
one
percent
of
our
business
and
we
are
not
able
to
perform
our
services
unless
you
increase
it
please,
you
initiate
a
procedure,
we
can't
--
they
can't
compel
them,
but
they
can
ask
for
it.
so
there's
nothing
that
says
that
the
company
is
tiny
in
getting
out
of
a
contract
when
it's
against
the
public
interest.
it's
merely
as
time
we
confided
in
this
contract
when
the
--
when
it's
gotten
all
the
benefits
of
it
because
the
reason
it
entered
into
it
no
longer
exist
and
doesn't
want
to
have
to
pay
the
price
for
the
benefit,
that's
all.
they've
got
the
benefit
here
when
we
gave
up
all
the
chance
to
deal
or
keep
power
for
somewhere
else,
and
now
we
can't
get
it
from
somewhere
else.
they
don't
want
to
pay
the
price.
that's
all
there
is
to
this
case
as
similar
in
the
other
