into

i
thought
he
denied
(inaudible)
justice

mr.
wahrenbrock
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
want
to
see
a
great
deal
about
armour
case
and
look
at
attention.
i
suppose,
my
recollection
much
lawfully
thought
as
it
well
may
be.
is
that
case
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
as
i
remember
it
that
was
the
prosecution
under
the
elkins
act.
the
elkins
act
was
explicit
that
any
department
from
the
filed
tariff
shall
be
an
offense,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
what's
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
if
this
were
a
situation
in
which
this
new
rate
hasn't
been
filed
and
there
has
been
a
provision
because
i
believe
there
is
none
comparable
to
the
(inaudible)
act
making
a
department
from
the
filed
tariff
an
offense
then
the
armour
case
would
shed
light
on
this
subject
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
the
armour
case
because
that's
insignificant
to
that
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
lay
down,
congress
did
lay
down
a
mechanical
or
dramatic
rule
that
if
a
rate
is
filed,
that
shall
control
no
matter
what.
and
it
went
to
the
extent
of
even
holding
that
as
a
punishable
offense
without
any
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
--
as
i
understand
i'm
greatly
troubled
by
your
(inaudible)
it's
not
a
rolling
of
a
log
problem.
as
i
understand
that
the
problem
of
this
case
is
to
reconcile
section
4
and
section
5
in
--
in
the
natural
gas
and
205
and
206
in
this
case.
and
making
an
accommodation
in
a
situation
in
which
as
i
ordered
the
counsel
before
you
in
which
there
is
a
three
proposition
of
a
net
worth
of
contract
of
which
the
act
of
it
is
the
three
proposition
in
the
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
that
--
that
there
is
a
three
proposition
that
the
net
worth
of
contract
in
the
--
in
this
regulatory
measure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
would
have
to
--
suppose
--
suppose
the
precedence
to
the
court
of
appeals
under
lays
that
ground
of
inquiry,
do
you
mind
sketching
what
would
happen
(inaudible)
before
the
commission
would
be
if
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
had
followed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
not
in
the
term,
procedure,
what
would
hereafter
follow
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
no
doubt
it
should
be
given
without
any
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
it
could
not
(inaudible)
the
position
that
the
contract
is
--
was
unfair.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
am
i
wrong
in
inferring
to
what
you've
said
that
it
could
be
very
easily
demonstrated
that
2.6
is
unjust
and
unreasonable.
therefore,
the
contract
could
be
knocked
out
and
that
is
you
go
ahead
passing
on
the
fairness
of
the
proposed
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
statute
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
with
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
might
be
a
difference
if
in
asking
for
an
increase
necessarily
impliedly
and
they
say
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
pull
that
out
--
if
you
pull
that
out,
if
you
go
ahead
and
establish
what
you
just
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
what
now
are
you
assuming
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
is
that
all
of
the
--
it
takes
a
lot
of
difference
in
the
state
of
things
that
is
devised
for
--
sometimes
it
continue
(inaudible)
whether
you
can
start
the
other
way
around
and
hold
this
thing
up
a
year,
it
ought
to
determine
whether
a
displacing
rate
is
too
high.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
chanler,
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't
either
under
the
federal
power
act
or
the
natural
gas
act,
is
there
a
provision
comparable
with
to
that
(inaudible)
act
prohibiting
the
railroads
to
charge
a
lower
rate
or
they
would
likely
for
competitive
reasons
because
it
was
being
economic
to
the
point
view
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
is
there
--
is
there
a
provision
which
precludes
--
is
there
an
--
(inaudible)
commission
said
at
the
interstate
commerce
commission
says
all
the
time
(inaudible)
it
cannot
charge
too
low
rate
for
the
economic
rate
is
erroneous,
is
there
such
a
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
about
contracts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
at
this
rate,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
may
say
--
or
whatever
that
is
reasonable,
5
cents
more
(inaudible)
but
it
did
give
you
a
(inaudible)
and
all
the
rest
of
it
by
the
--
there
is
no
supply
as
i
know
and
so
far
as
i've
heard.
in
these
regulatory
measures
under
the
authority
of
the
federal
power
commission.
there
is
no
such
a
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
four
and
--
to
that
--
the
four
and
a
half,
whatever
it
was,
is
actually
being
uneconomic
rates,
you
intimated
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
under
the
contract
but
they
can't
make
a
lower
rate
in
order
to
be
comparable.
