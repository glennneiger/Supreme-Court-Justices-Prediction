mr.

e.
wahrenbrock
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
we
have
the
same
question
under
generally
identical
rate
provisions
of
the
federal
power
act.
except
that
here,
the
increase
which
was
proposed,
filed
was
suspended
by
the
federal
power
commission
for
a
period
of
five
months
and
thereafter
provisions
made
for
the
refund
of
any
difference
there
might
ultimately
be
determined
to
be.
and
here
also,
the
hearing
was
completed
and
the
increased
rate
was
found
reasonable.
the
commission's
proceedings
terminated,
leaving
the
increased
rate
in
effect.
pacific
gas
and
electric
company,
a
large
utility
in
the
northern
central
part
of
california
and
in
the
vicinity
of
san
francisco
is
a
public
utility
within
the
meaning
of
the
that
term
as
used
in
the
federal
power
act
and
generally
subject
to
regulation
under
the
federal
power
act,
and
has
on
file
with
the
federal
power
commission
its
rates
for
the
sale
and

of

in
interstate
commerce.
sierra,
which
is
a
public
utility
serving
the
eastern
part
of
california
in
the
vicinity
of
lake
tahoe
and
the
western
part
of
nevada
in
the
vicinity
of
carson
city
and
reno,
has
a
few
small
hydroelectric
plants
of
its
own
but
purchases,
most
of
its
power
requirements
from
pacific
gas
and
electric.
pacific
gas
and
electric
maintains
three
long
high
tension
transmission
lines
parallel
to
each
other
from
its
interconnected
transmission
system
in
california
leading
up
into
the
sierras
through
the
donner
pass,
to
the
point
known
as
summit
where
the
lines
continue
under
the
ownership
of
sierra
pacific
power
company
to
its
territory.
the
sale
of
energy
here
is
made
under
a
contract
that
was
negotiated
in
1948
for
a
period
of
15
years.
under
that
contract,
pacific
gas
and
electric
was
obligated
to
build
the
third
of
this
now
existing
transmission
lines
and
was
also
obligated
when
the
load
reached
the
point
where
it
had
to
have
more
transmission
capacity
to
build
a
fourth
transmission
line,
which
i
believe
the
record
does
not
show
but
which
is
or
has
been
recently
completed
or
will
soon
be
completed.
and
the
contract
will
run
15
years
from
the
termination
of
that
--
that
15
years
after
the
completion
of
that
line.
the
rate
was
increased
as
we
view
it
by
pacific
gas
and
electric,
filing
a
new
rate
with
the
federal
power
commission
corresponding
roughly
to
the
increases
which
it
had
already
put
into
effect
or
was
in
the
process
of
putting
into
effect
for
its
intrastate
customers
in
california.
the
increase
filed
with
the
federal
power
commission
was
supported
as
all
increases
filed
with
the
commissioner
required
to
be
supported
with
what
has
been
referred
to
and
is
properly
referred
to
as
a
prima
facie
rate
case.
the
commission's
rules
require
that
--
that
not
merely
the
new
schedule
but
a
cost
of
rendering
the
service,
a
study
of
the
cost
of
rendering
the
service
shall
be
filed.
that
study
to
be
based
on
the
company's
book
figures.
its
figures
of
its
actual
operations
as
kept
under
the
commission's
uniform
system
of
accounts
and
i
might
point
out
that
that
is
the
system
of
accounts
under
which
the
commission
has
eliminated
something
like
a
billion
and
a
half
--
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
of
water
inflation
from
the
accounts
of
these
electric
companies.
under
those
--
under
that
regulated
system,
their
accounts
are
now
kept
and
this
cost
of
service
study
must
be
based
on
book
figures.
where
any
adjustments
are
made
in
book
figures,
the
commission's
rules
require
that
they
be
fully
explained
and
justified
in
the
filing
that
it
submitted.
the
filing
must
also
include
a
comparison
of
revenues
under
the
old
rate
with
revenues
under
the
new
rate
for
a
test
period
of
12
months.
during
the
60-day
period
which
elapsed
after
these
rates
were
filed
and
before
they
were
to
go
into
effect,
the
commission
invited
comments
from
the
california
commission,
that's
--
the
nevada
commission
and
the
customer
company,
the
sierra
pacific
power
company,
and
its
staff
scrutinized
the
data
which
had
been
submitted.
following
the
receipt
of
responses
to
its
invitations
and
the
study,
the
commission
set
a
hearing
on
the
proposed
rate
increased,
as
increased
and
suspended
the
operation,
the
effective
date
of
that
rate
increase
for
five
months.
sierra
had
requested
here
as
mobile
did
in
the
other
case
that
the
commission
reject
the
filing
by
a
petition
filed
for
that
purpose.
the
commission
denied
that
petition
without
prejudice
in
this
case
to
the
renewal
of
the
objection
at
the
hearing
and
sierra
did
renew
the
objection
at
the
hearing.
the
hearing
was
not
completed
within
the
five
months
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
five
months
period,
the
commission
ordered
that
pacific
gas
and
electric
keep
a
special
account
of
the
difference
if
any
between
the
charges
at
the
old
rate
and
the
--
the
charges
at
the
rate
it
was
collecting.
and
any
amount
which
the
commission
might
subsequently
find
to
be
the
difference
between
that
and
a
reasonable
rate
and
if
--
and
keep
it
subject
to
refund
to
sierra.
the
hearing
was
held
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
5
(e)
--
206
(e)
which
corresponds
to
5
(e)
of
the
gas
act.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
hearing
was
held
pursuant
to
205
(e)
and
that
is
printed
in
the
--
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
page
39
i
believe
it
is.
that
--
at
that
--
under
that
section
on
page
40
of
our
--
our
briefs.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
almost
identical
except
for
there's
--
there's
no
prohibition
on
suspension
but
otherwise
it's
substantially
the
same.
and
under
that,
at
this
hearing,
the
burden
is
on
the
proponent
of
the
increased
rate.
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
it
to
justify
it.
pg&e
sought
to
carry
that
burden
at
this
hearing
and
it
also
undertook
to
show
in
response
to
special
questions
addressed
to
it
by
the
commission
how
the
rate
of
return
it
would
earn
under
the
new
rate
compared
with
what
might
have
reasonably
been
foreseen
at
the
time
the
contract
was
first
entered
into
in
1948.
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
the
commission
found
a
new
rate
reasonable,
terminated
its
proceeding
and
let
the
increased
rate
to
go
into
effect.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
relying
largely
on
the
mobile
decision
by
the
third
circuit
which
had
preceded,
reversed
the
commission's
order.
now,
this
is
--
this
action
has
been
referred
to
by
our
opponents
as
a
unilateral
--
a
unilateral
action
by
one
party
and
i
submit
that
it
is
no
more
in
view
of
the
statutory
proceedings
that
have
been
followed
by
the
commission
in
this
case
as
--
as
in
others,
no
more
unilateral
action
by
one
party
to
a
contract
and
the
entry
of
a
default
judgment
in
a
proceeding
at
law
is
unilateral
action
by
the
plaintiff.
it's
the
construction
of
this
--
that
the
commission
has
placed
on
sections
5
(a)
and
--
and
4
(e),
and
i'm
speaking
205
and
206
is
that
they
are
complimentary.
they
are
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
inquiry
(inaudible)
because
the
section
206
applies
only
upon
complaint
by
named
parties
which
does
not
include
the
selling
utility.
the
selling
utility
cannot
come
to
the
commission
and
complain
of
its
own
rate.
in
contrary
to
the
statement
of
my
brother
fletcher,
the
commission's
position
is
that
--
that
a
utility
may
not
complain
of
its
own
rate
because
section
306
of
the
federal
power
act,
which
is
printed
at
the
bottom
of
41,
shows
what
a
complaint
--
what
a
complaint
procedure
involves.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
and
certainly
we
do
and
our
position
is
that
under
this
language
of
section
306,
which
is
printed
at
the
bottom
of
page
41,
the
utility
cannot
complain
of
its
own
rate.
it
says
any
person
and
that
would
--
that
might
include
a
utility
but
let's
go
on.
any
person,
state,
municipality
or
state
commission
complaining
of
anything
done
or
omitted
to
be
done
by
any
licensee
or
public
utility,
and
we
suggest
the
inconsistency
of
that
usage
right
there,
in
contravention
of
the
provisions
for
this
act
may
apply
to
the
commission
by
petition
which
shall
briefly
state
the
facts.
whereupon,
a
statement
of
the
complaint
thus
made
shall
be
forwarded
by
the
commission
to
such
licensee
or
public
utility.
obviously,
a
procedure
not
intended
to
apply
to
a
utility
complaining
of
itself.
therefore,
it
is
our
conclusion
that
the
utility
cannot
complain
if
the
rate
is
too
low
under
the
second
to
these
sections.
there
is
left
only
its
right
to
propose
an
increase
by
filing
the
increase
under
the
first
of
these
two
sections.
and
a
necessity
for
that
complimentary
reading
of
the
two
sections
was
recognized
by
the
commission
very
early
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
power
act
in
the
case
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
city
of
los
angeles
against
the
nevada
california
electric
company
where
it
was
complained
by
the
selling
--
by
the
--
one
of
the
parties
there
that
there
was
no
correlative
right
to
that
which
the
customer
had
under
the
second
of
these
two
sections,
and
the
commission
says
there
is
a
correlative
right.
it
is
for
the
utility
to
file
its
increase
under
the
first
of
these
two
sections.
that
was
while
the
commission
had
as
a
majority
of
its
membership,
a
majority
of
those
who
were
members
of
the
commission
at
the
time
the
act
--
the
legislation
was
enacted
and
who
were
familiar
with
its
legislative
history
from
their
own
personal
participation
in
here.
now,
i
submit
that
any
other
proceeding
is
a
one-way
street
if
the
statutory
standard
of
just
and
reasonable
is
to
be
applied
on
behalf
of
the
purchasers
against
the
too
high
rate.
fairness
requires
that
it
would
be
applied
upon
behalf
of
the
seller
if
it
is
a
too
low
rate
and
i
think
that
this
illustrates
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
the
justices
who
concurred
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
montana-dakota
utilities
company
case
had
in
mind
when
they
said
that
the
statute
utilizes
the
self-interest
on
both
sides.
i
don't
think
he
said
on
both
sides,
the
self-interest
of
the
parties
to
implement
the
statutory
standard
of
just
and
reasonable.
now,
these
proceed
--
these
provisions
for
filing
rates
were
taken
from
the
interstate
commerce
act
because
--
well,
before
the
1935
legislation
in
which
the
--
these
provisions
were
added
to
the
old
federal
water
power
act,
that
act
which
provided
for
some
regulation
of
the
rates
of
licensees
under
its
terms,
now
part
one
of
the
federal
power
act,
went
in
a
no
detail
at
all.
it
simply
conferred
jurisdiction
upon
the
federal
power
commission
to
regulate
the
rates
and
the
securities
of
licensees
and
did
so
by
this
kind
of
language
saying,
the
administration
of
the
provisions
of
this
section
so
far
as
applicable
shall
be
according
to
the
procedure
and
practice
in
fixing
and
regulating
the
rates
charged
and
--
charges
and
practices
of
railroad
companies
as
provided
in
the
act
to
regulate
commerce.
in
1935,
in
lieu
of
that
legislation
by
reference,
congress
wrote
into
the
federal
power
act
provisions
in
--
which
are
exactly
parallel
to
those
in
the
natural
gas
act
and
on
page
46
and
47
of
our
brief,
we
state
the
parallelism.
the
--
the
three
--
the
two
subsections
of
the
first
of
these
two
sections
have
parallel
sections
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
5
(a)
or
206
(a)
have
parallel
--
has
a
parallel
section
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
now
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
on
page
46
and
47
of
our
brief
in
mobile.
we
--
we
adopt
in
the
sierra
case,
that
part
of
the
argument
in
our
mobile
brief,
46
and
47
of
the
mobile
brief.
now,
a
reference
has
been
made
to
the
armour
case
and
we
submit
that
it
is
a
square
precedent
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
what
the
commission
has
here
done
under
the
--
the
power
act
and
under
the
gas
act.
i
want
to
supplement
what
mr.
chanler
said
about
the
armour
case
because
it
seemed
to
me
from
his
statement,
it
was
not
claimed
that
after
the
armour
packing
company
had
entered
into
the
six
months
contract
for
the
carriage
of
oleo
oil
from
the
from
the
mississippi
river
to
new
york
city
at
a
rate
of
23
cents
a
hundred
weight.
after
that,
about
a
month,
it
filed
an
increase.
it
had
a
valid
outstanding
contract.
it
filed
an
increase
and
charged,
but
continued
to
charge
at
the
old
contract
rate
and
armour
packing
company
paid
at
the
old
contract
rate.
the
armour
packing
company
case
was
a
prosecution
of
the
armour
packing
company
for
paying
only
23
cents
and
not
paying
the
increase
rate
of
35
cents.
the
supreme
court
upheld
that
conviction.
now,
that
makes
--
i
want
to
make
two
points
about
that.
first,
armour
was
convicted
because
it
consented
to,
it
was
not
objecting.
it
consented
to
the
charging
of
the
old
rate,
it
would
go
along
with
it,
that
--
certainly,
the
fact
that
it
was
--
was
convicted
for
going
along
with
the
old
rate
shows
that
its
consent
to
the
change
is
not
necessary.
in
the
second
place,
its
contract
was
not,
i
submit,
outlawed
as
the
suggestion
has
been
made
and
we
think
that
is
claimed
from
the
very
language
of
the
opinion
itself
and
i
refer
to
the
part
of
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
day
which
we
refer
to
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
5..
our
reply
brief
in
the
mobile
case,
we
quote
the
language
which
follows
that
that
mr.
chanler
relies
on.
mr.
chanler
relies
on
the
language
of
mr.
day
--
of
mr.
justice
day,
“it
is
for
congress
to
decide
whether
contracts
should
be
recognized
giving
stability
to
rates
for
limited
periods.”
now,
for
20
or
30
years
after
the
armour
case,
i
think
it
was
decided
in
1907,
congress
did
not
act
on
that
suggestion
of
mr.
justice
day.
but
mr.
chanler
says
that
in
enacting
the
federal
power
act
although
just
followed
the
exact
wording
of
the
--
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
congress
was
acting
on
that
suggestion
because
he
says
the
provision
for
filing
contracts
means
not
only
that
they're
filed,
but
that
they
cannot
be
changed
the
way
rates
can.
it's
true,
i
think
he'll
have
to
recognize.
this
first
section
says
they
shall
be
filed
in
the
same
terms,
it
says
that
rates
shall
be
filed.
that
says
they
may
be
changed
in
the
same
terms
in
which
rates
may
be
changed.
but
he
says
it
doesn't
mean
that,
that
requirement
gives
contracts
somehow
more
meaning
than
they
had
more
dignity,
more
status,
more
invulnerability
to
change
than
they
had
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
on
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
there
is
not
a
single
reference
throughout
the
entire
history
of
the
federal
power
act
or
the
natural
gas
act's
enactment
to
any
intention
upon
the
part
of
anybody
to
pick
up
that
suggestion
of
mr.
justice
day
to
accomplish
anything
different.
we
submit
that
the
result
is
just
the
same
whether
you
filed
the
contract
or
whether
you
do
not.
the
contracts
remain
valid
and
subsisting
obligations
except
to
the
extent
that
they
are
changed
by
a
legally
enforceable
rate
under
the
new
act,
whether
that
legally
enforceable
rate
under
the
new
act
--
under
the
new
filing
is
by
a
prescription
of
the
commission
or
whether
it
is
by
a
filing
which
the
commission
by
in
action
allows
to
go
into
effect.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
this
--
this
statute
likewise
says
that
every
rate
must
be
filed
with
the
commission,
every
contract
must
be
filed
and
the
commission's
regulations
are
explicit
that
no
rate
may
be
charged
except
those
which
are
filed,
so
that
the
effect
is
the
same
under
both
statutes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
is
the
same
--
it's
not
in
those
terms
but
the
effect
of
this
statute
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
same
thing
is
applicable
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
think
that
the
--
the
effect
of
this
statute
is
just
the
same,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
when
it
says
that
after
having
specified
that
every
--
in
the
first
of
this,
the
205
(c)
on
page
39,
that
every
public
utility
shall
file
with
the
commission
and
keep
open
the
so
forth
schedule
showing
all
rates
and
charges.
and
when
it
says
in
subsection
(d)
that
no
change
shall
be
made,
that
any
charge
made
which
has
not
been
filed
is
illegal.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
legislative
history
we
think
shows
no
basis
for
reaching
any
different
conclusion
from
the
identical
language
here
to
the
--
that's
the
language
which
is
in
the
--
in
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
will
agree
that
this
statute
does
to
contracts
only
what
the
interstate
commerce
act
did
to
them.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
commission
will
reverse
its
order
rejecting
these
filings
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
principal
difference
will
be
this,
that
when
a
rate
increase
is
sought,
which
the
commission
has
no
reason
to
believe
can
be
blocked
or
defeated.
it
will
nevertheless
have
to
spend
its
time
conducting
formal
hearings
to
allow
that
rate
case
to
go
into
effect
if
it
has
to
do
anything,
but
the
only
thing
--
only
way
in
which
it
has
to
do
anything
is
to
initiate
a
proceeding
on
its
own
because
that
would
be
a
proceeding
under
the
second
of
these
sections.
because
the
selling
utility
has
no
legal
right
to
have
a
proceeding,
it
has
to
be
on
the
initiative
of
the
commission,
the
commission
itself.
now,
the
commission
then
would
if
there
were
to
be
any
increase
at
all,
they
would
have
to
--
and
it
felt
that
one
was
justified,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
it
to
initiate
a
proceeding
and
go
through
what
the
hearing
in
order
to
effectuate
an
increase
which
it
had
no
doubt
should
be
given
and
would
spend
much
of
its
time
doing
that.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
it
has
reviewed
the
cost
of
service
study
made
by
the
company
and
it's
determined
that
there
is
no
basis
for
finding
that
a
design
--
an
increase
is
an
unreasonable.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
there
is
no
difference.
i
think
that
the
commission
and
that
--
that
is
indicated
by
the
commission's
finding
in
this
--
in
this
case,
not
--
i
won't
--
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
finding.
in
this
case,
the
commission
found
that
the
proposed
rate
would
produce
a
return
of
about
4.75%,
whereas
5.5%
would
be
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
electric
department
business
of
this
country
as
a
whole.
commission
--
although,
sierra
is
not
in
a
position
to
complain
of
a
too
low
rate.
the
commission
examine
into
that,
found
there'd
be
no
discrimination,
found
that
--
that
concession
of
three
quarters
of
percent
point
was
justified
in
order
to
retain
the
business
and
it
would
--
would
not
be
born
by
any
other
rate
pair
subject
to
the
federal
power
commission's
jurisdiction.
and
the
commission
noted
the
expressions
by
the
california
commission
of
its
determination
not
to
allow
any
other
rate
payers
under
--
the
other
rates
to
have
to
bear
this
increase.
but
on
the
other
hand
to
require
the
stockholders
of
the
company
to
bear
any
concession
made
here
and
upon
consideration
of
such
factors
the
commission
said
that
on
this
state
of
the
record
it
would
require
other
factors
than
this
for
us
--
that
are
shown,
for
us
to
find
that
this
concession
is
unreasonable
and
they
found
the
rate
was
just
and
reasonable.
but
they
also
found
in
that
connection
that
the
contract
rate
would
have
produced
a
return
of
2.6
in
addition
to
all
operating
expenses
and
they
said
that
there
was
no
basis
in
this
record
for
finding
that
that
was
a
reasonable
rate,
and
they
said
if
we
had
to
make
a
finding
on
that
our
finding
would
be
that
that
was
unjust
and
unreasonable
because
too
low.
now,
that
--
that
it
seems
to
me
to
thoroughly
dispose
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
any
speculation
that
hypothetically
maybe
there's
a
zone
within
which
the
old
contract
might
fall.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
think
that
could
--
it's
a
fair
proposition
but
the
commission
thought
that
it
was
not
necessary
because
our
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
that's
right,
exactly.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
if
i
may
to
some
of
the
other
cases.
we
rely
in
--
we
rely
in
our
brief
upon
the
midland
case
which
was
subsequently
decided,
which
was
--
which
arose
in
missouri
under
a
provision
of
the
missouri
statute
which
is
like
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
the
natural
gas
act,
and
the
federal
power
act.
the
missouri
commission
was
confronted
with
perhaps
an
even
harder
case,
there,
a
utility
had
a
contract.
it
filed
an
increase
without
the
consent
of
the
customer.
the
increase
was
subsequently
examined
by
the
commission
and
found
to
be
too
high
an
increase
to
be
unreasonable
and
the
missouri
commission
only
allowed
part
of
the
increase
but
for
a
period
of
about
nine
months,
the
--
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceedings
before
the
commission,
the
old
--
the
--
the
filed
rate,
the
too
high
filed
rate
was
in
effect
and
was
collected.
subsequently,
the
reduced
rate
prescribed
by
the
commission
was
collected.
the
customers
sought
to
recover
all
excesses
over
his
old
contract
rate.
the
missouri
court
denied
him
recovery.
as
to
the
rate
prescribed
by
the
commission,
i
need
not
go
into
that.
but
as
to
the
filed
rate
the
--
the
missouri
commission
--
the
missouri
court
held
that
the
utility
having
filed
the
increase
was
entitled
to
recover
it
and
--
and
to
keep
it
on
pendente
lite.
this
court
reviewed
that
decision
and
held
that
there
was
no
unconstitutionality
and
the
result
reached.no
bar
--
no
impairment
of
the
obligation
of
contract
and
no
taking
of
property
without
due
process
of
law.
the
counsel
for
our
opponents
seeks
to
distinguish
it.
he
says
there's
a
peculiar
provision
of
the
missouri
constitution,
which
made
the
--
which
made
the
contract
invalid
even
before
the
statute
was
--
was
enacted,
a
provision
of
the
missouri
constitution
preserving
the
police
power.
the
answer
to
that
it
seems
clear
to
us
is
found
in
the
language
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
itself
in
--
on
the
pages
we
cite
in
our
brief,
where
it
expressly
held
that
the
contracts
were
valid
and
remained
valid
until
they
had
been
supersede
by
the
filed
rate
and
the
language
of
this
court,
which
we
quote
in
our
brief,
where
it
expressly
assumed
that
the
contracts
were
valid.
if
therefore,
it's
not
necessary
to
go
outside
of
the
decisions
to
find
some
ground
upon
which
to
distinguish
of.
missouri
is
only
1
of
10
states,
in
which
there
had
been
square
holdings
and
as
we
read
these
briefs,
we
find
nothing
in
either
mobile's
or
sierra
to
deny
that
each
one
of
this
10
states
including
missouri
had
cases
which
had
held
that
the
filed
rate
superseded
the
contract
rate,
missouri,
new
york,
pennsylvania,
colorado,
wisconsin,
arkansas,
new
jersey
and
washington.
we
pointed
out
in
our
original
brief
that
there
were
two
states
contrary,
virginia
and
rhode
island.
and
we
explained
why
we
think
that
they
reached
erroneous
results
on
the
grounds
stated
in
those
opinions.
we
have
found
one
other
dictum
that
is
possibly
contrary
in
--
to
our
position
in
vermont
and
two
that
we
think
are
in
accord
with
our
position
in
massachusetts
and
indiana.
there
are
about
30
states
that
have
this
kind
of
statute.
in
those
states
in
which
we
found
no
opinions,
no
decided
cases,
we
made
a
little
survey,
we
communicated
with
the
commissions
and
attempt
to
find
out
what
their
practice
was.
and
we
have
found
that
in
some
cases,
there
are
special
statutory
provisions
that
all
increases,
regardless
of
contracts
have
to
be
specially
passed
on
by
the
commission
with
expressed
findings,
and
others
that
any
--
any
change
proposed
by
a
utility
must
be
passed
on
by
the
commission.
but
our
survey
of
the
remaining
states
shows
that
the
practice
of
those
states
is
even
more
preponderantly
in
accordance
with
our
position
than
the
decided
cases
that
we
have
referred
to.
the
--
our
opponents
rely
upon
the
wichita
case
in
this
court.
now,
that
case
undeniably,
and
we
do
not
dispute
it,
held
that
a
contract
rate
could
not
be
changed
by
a
new
schedule
in
the
absence
of
a
commission
finding,
but
the
reason
for
the
case
is
perfectly
plain.
kansas
is
not
one
of
the
30
states
having
this
kind
of
filed
rate
procedure.
furthermore,
the
rate
schedule
which
was
there
sought
to
be
effectuated,
the
validity
of
which
was
before
this
court,
was
one
which
was
prescribed
by
the
commission,
it
was
not
the
rate
schedule
which
had
been
filed
by
the
company.
there
was
therefore
no
question
of
whether
a
rate
schedule
filed
by
the
company
could
go
into
effect.
it
was
a
rate
schedule
prescribed
by
the
commission,
a
lower
amount
--
a
lower
rate
than
that
which
the
company
had
filed.
and
their
only
question
was
whether
under
the
terms
of
the
kansas
statute,
findings
were
necessary
to
be
made
by
the
commission
in
order
to
--
to
support
the
rate
which
it
had
prescribed.
now,
that
the
kansas
statute
is
not
a
filed
rate
procedure
is
admitted
by
mobile
in
its
brief
on
page
35
and
i
read
the
language
which
mobile
uses.
it
says,
“the
only
distinction
between
that
provision,
referring
to
the
kansas
statute,
and
the
natural
gas
act
is
that
under
the
kansas
statute
no
proposed
change
may
become
effective
without
the
affirmative
consent
of
the
commission.”
exactly.
that
requirement
of
the
affirmative
consent
of
the
commission
is
just
what
there
is
not
in
our
act,
in
the
filed
rate
procedure
where
what
is
required
is
the
in
action
of
the
commission
with
a
chance
to
veto
it,
but
if
doesn't
act,
the
changed
rate
schedule
goes
into
effect.
now,
in
conclusion
and
my
time
that
i
--
my
division
of
time
that
i
have
agreed
upon.
i
think
that
--
i
want
also
in
this
connection
to
refer
to
the
--
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
one
that
in
the
state
of
new
york,
where
this
very
problem
of
a
rate
that
arises
in
the
mobile
case,
where
the
commission
may
not
suspend
and
in
spite
of
the
concessions
made
by
mr.
chanler,
i
think
that
--
that
problem
is
a
bothersome
one.
and
i
want
to
call
your
particular
attention
to
the
language
which
we
quote
from
the
(inaudible)
natural
gas
company
case
on
page
87
of
our
brief,
where
the
new
york
court
examined
this
question
of
a
rate
which
could
not
be
suspended,
where
the
selling
utility
can
put
a
rate
into
effect
which
may
be
higher
than
the
commission
will
ultimately
find
to
be
reasonable
and
yet
maybe
in
effect
during
the
pendency
of
the
proceeding.
the
new
york
court
examined
that
question
and
says
in
conclusion
at
the
bottom
of
page
87
in
the
footnote,
if
there
is
a
defect
it
must
be
cured
if
at
all
by
the
legislature.
i
come
back
to
what
i
said
in
the
opening
on
my
first
argument
here,
that
this
commission
has
several
times
recommended
to
congress
that
that
prohibition
on
suspension
be
changed,
congress
does
not
seemed
fit
to
act
and
mr.
justice
burton
properly,
i
--
my
opinion
called
attention
to
the
fact.
the
explanation
probably
is
the
feeling
that
in
this
industrial
resale
contracts,
the
parties
can
protect
their
own
interest
and
if
there
is
an
increase,
it
is
passed
along
by
the
industrial
company
in
its
own
prices
and
there
is
not
the
necessity
for
a
rebate,
or
a
refund,
or
protection
that
there
is
where
the
resales
are
to
ultimate
consumers.
in
conclusion,
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
final
analysis
our
opponents
have
not
cited
a
single
case,
not
a
single
case
under
any
filed
rate
type
of
statute
holding
that
contracted
rates
are
not
changeable
by
a
subsequent
rate
filing
while
other
rates
are.
i
should
have
emphasized
earlier
if
i'd
reached
that
part
--
part
of
the
argument
that
although
mr.
chanler
says
that
contracted
rates
may
not
be
changed
under
the
first
section
procedure,
yet
he
had
--
admits
that
if
the
other
party
agrees
they
may
be
changed.
if
the
other
party
doesn't
object,
that
is
to
say,
the
rate
--
the
rate
is
filed,
the
rate
increase
is
filed,
the
other
party
doesn't
object,
he
says
the
commission
can
go
ahead
there.
he
says
also
that
the
commission
can
allow
it
to
take
effect
if
there's
been
a
filing
under
--
a
finding
of
unlawfulness
under
the
second
of
these
two
sections.
there's
no
language
in
the
first
of
these
sections
to
say
that
there
is
any
such
qualification.
in
--
in
any
case,
the
commission
either
allows
it
to
go
in
effect
or
not
in
accordance
with
its
own
discretion.
