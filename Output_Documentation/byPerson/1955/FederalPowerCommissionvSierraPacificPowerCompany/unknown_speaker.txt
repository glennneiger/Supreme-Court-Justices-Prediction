unknown
speaker
--
is
that
a
reference
to
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
in
this
--
this
instance
--
in
this
particular
case,
you've
got
a
higher
rate
than
you
had
by
contract,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and
the
higher
rate
has
been
put
immediately
into
effect.
unknown
speaker
by
the
declaration
of
the
commission
that
it
was
a
reasonable
rate.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
the
commission
hasn't
already
determined
that
your
rate
is
reasonable?
unknown
speaker

what
other
hearing
is
it
going

be
no

for
sierra
to
recover
anything
on
the
basis
of
their
contract.

unknown

and
do

mean
without
any
refund?
unknown

how
do

reconcile
that
with
their
statement
when
they
said
that
if
they
have
had
to
make
a
finding,
they
would
have
found
that
it
was
unreasonably
low?
unknown
speaker
well
that
--
doesn't
that
overstate
the
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
their
position?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
first
case,
they're
going
to
have
to
have
a
hearing,
are
they
not,
