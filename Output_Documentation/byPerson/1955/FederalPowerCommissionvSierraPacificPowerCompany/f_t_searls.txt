mr.
f.
t.
searls
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
very
brief
time
which
i
have
allotted
myself
by
agreement
with
mr.
wahrenbrock,
i
will
have
to
limit
my
discussion
to
a
very
few
point.
there's
one
at
the
outset
that
i
believe
should
be
explored
because
i
don't
think
that
the
argument
thus
far
has
got
into
the
bottom
of
a
basic
matter
in
connection
with
the
regulatory
process.
the
question
really
before
you've
hear
is
what
is
the
reasonable
rate
for
service
by
pg&e
to
sierra
depends
upon
the
procedure
by
which
that
rate
is
determined.
the
court
below
felt
that
the
filing
procedure
was
defective
because
it
permitted
a
reasonable
contract
rate
to
be
displaced
by
a
reasonable
higher
rate.
now,
implicit
in
that
is
the
proposition
that
there
is
more
than
one
reasonable
rate
and
i
believe
of
that
proposition
seems
somewhat
plausible
and
has
been
accepted
in
--
from
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
here
this
morning.
but
i
submit
that
on
examination,
that
will
be
found
that
that
proposition
does
not
hold
on.
the
statutory
standard,
section
205
(a)
of
the
federal
power
act,
says
that
all
rates
shall
be
just
and
reasonable
and
all
rates
that
are
not
just
and
reasonable
are
unlawful.
that
is
the
measure
of
the
public
interest
which
congress
prescribed
in
carrying
out
its
idea
of
what
regulation
should
be
enacted
in
the
public
interest,
exactly
what
it
declared
it
was
doing
in
section
201
(a)
of
the
act.
the
--
that
is
a
standard,
that
just
and
reasonable
standard
is
a
standard
to
be
applied
by
the
commission
as
this
court
has
very
clearly
pointed
out
in
the
montana-dakota
case
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
part
of
the
case
is
the
portion
with
which
some
members
of
this
court
were
unhappy.
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
is
to
be
made
precise
by
the
commission,
that
is
the
body
which
is
to
apply
it
and
to
me
it
is
unthinkable
that
the
commission
that
--
should
have
to
accept
a
rate
which
a
utility
files,
which
is
higher
than
the
rate
which
the
commission
itself
considers
to
be
reasonable.
the
area
concept
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
arises
from
the
self-limitation
of
the
court
in
applying
the
federal
power
act
and
the
natural
gas
act.
the
courts
say
that
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
is
an
abstract
standard,
which
is
to
be
made
precise
by
the
commission
and
within
reasonable
bounds,
the
courts
will
not
interfere
but
the
commission
imposes
no
such
self-limitation
upon
itself
and
there's
no
reason
to
do
so.
the
commission
is
--
has
been
delegated
legislative
powers
by
the
congress
to
fix
rates,
to
determine
what
is
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
the
utility,
of
course,
is
not
the
delegee
of
any
such
power.
the
commission
is
the
appointed
body
to
protect
the
public
interest,
the
utility
or
entire
obligations
to
observe
the
public
interest.
obviously,
cannot
be
relied
upon
as
the
guardian
of
the
public
interest
and
the
commission
standard
must
prevail
whenever
there
is
a
conflict
between
its
ideas
and
the
--
and
the
utilities.
this
is
completely
contrary
to
the
notion
that
the
commission
allows
some
area
within
which
the
utility
may
operate
of
--
and
i
may
say
that
the
commission
in
practice
is
of
exactly
this
opinion.
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief
we
refer
to
the
april
1,
1955
decision
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company
case,
where
it
rejected
on
examiner's
view
that
there
was
a
zone
of
reasonableness
which
applied
to
the
commission.
i
will
discuss
that
later
then
when
we
are
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
just
before
the
recess,
i
was
stating
that
the
commission
itself
recognized
there's
no
area
of
concept
and
it's
our
determination
of
the
just
and
reasonable
standard.
and
i
referred
to
a
recent
decision
of
the
commission
which
i
mentioned
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief
where
the
commission
refused
to
accept
an
examiner's
holding
that
there
was
a
zone
of
reasonableness
of
--
and
the
examiner
had
decided
that
a
6.1%
return
could
be
accepted
on
a
filing
because
the
commission
had
previously
held
that
a
6%
return
was
reasonable
for
that
company.
the
commission
said
that
the
one-tenth
of
1%
return
doesn't
in
itself
measure
the
difference
between
a
fair
and
unfair
return,
but
it
said
that
we
must
fix
the
return
in
accordance
with
our
own
best
judgment.
accordingly,
the
commission
reduced
the
file
rate
there
from
a
6.1%
return
to
a
6%
return.
contrast
here,
the
zone
of
reasonableness
that
would
have
to
exist
if
sierra's
position
were
correct
comparing
a
2.6%
return
with
the
4.75%
return
compare
the
rate
which
is
filed
with
--
by
the
pg&e
with
the
old
contract
rate
which
yielded
only
78%
of
the
revenue
yielded
by
the
new
rate.
that
is
no
--
certainly,
a
zone
that
we
could
hardly
expect
a
court
to
recognize.
further
examination
of
what
the
commission
does
will
show
that
the
commission
doesn't
engage
in
a
two-step
procedure,
either
under
section
205
(e)
or
under
206
(a)
or
the
corresponding
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
commission
proceeds
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
the
available
evidence
from
all
of
the
figures
and
data,
what
it
believes
is
the
reasonable
rate
for
the
servicing
question,
and
if
the
filed
rate
is
different
then
the
commission
orders
the
rate
changed
accordingly.
and
it
follows
that
process
under
a
--
206
(a)
proceeding
just
as
clearly
as
it
does
under
a
--
205
(e)
proceeding.
the
record
in
the
hope
natural
gas
case
will
show
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
commission
did
there
and
that
was
a
5
(a)
proceeding.
the
provision
of
section
206
(a)
and
the
corresponding
one
of
section
5
(a)
of
the
gas
act,
doesn't
say
that
the
commission
shall
first
find
that
the
existing
rate
is
unreasonable
and
then,
if
it
does
so,
proceed
to
a
determination
of
the
reasonable
rate.
it
says
that
whenever
the
commission
finds
that
the
existing
rate
is
unreasonable,
then
it
shall
determine
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
the
process
which
the
commission
follows
as
i
say
is
not
a
two-step
procedure.if
to
proceeds
that
wants
to
decide
for
itself
what
is
the
reasonable
rate
and
then
proceeds
accordingly
to
adjust
the
existing
rate
if
necessary.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happens
under
the
other
proceedings
or
the
utility
files
at
proposed
rate.
the
commission
doesn't
take
the
proposed
rate
and
determine
whether
it
is
reasonable
and
if
it
finds
it
unreasonable
then
by
a
separate
step
decide
what
is
the
reasonable
rate,
it
proceeds
to
determine
what
in
its
own
mind
is
the
reasonable
rate,
and
fixes
the
rate
accordingly.
it
is
apparent
that
the
requirement
of
206
(a)
for
a
finding
that
the
existing
rate
be
reasonable
is
in
essence
a
burden
of
proof
or
failure
of
proof
requirement,
if
you
like.
it
says
in
effect
what
shall
happen
if
the
--
if
there
is
a
failure
of
proof,
then
the
commission
being
unable
to
find
the
existing
rate
unreasonable
or
any
other
rate
reasonable
must
lead
the
existing
rate
in
effect.
and
similarly,
under
section
205
(e),
the
burden
of
proof
is
expressly
placed
upon
the
utility
to
sustain
an
increase.
if
it
fails
to
sustain
its
burden
of
proof,
the
existing
rate
remains
in
effect.
the
--
if
we
are
--
if
this
principle
be
accepted
then
that
there
is
one
just
and
reasonable
rate
to
be
established
by
the
commission
in
its
own
best
judgment
using
its
expert
knowledge,
its
experience,
and
all
of
the
material
which
is
available
to
it
in
a
form
of
regular
filings
by
the
utility
and
the
general
economic
knowledge
which
it
has
on
the
industry
then,
we
submit,
there
is
no
difficulty
in
interpreting
the
federal
power
act
as
setting
up
two
procedures
for
changes
in
rates.
one,
the
section
205
procedure
is
--
for
a
use
by
the
utility
where
it
proposes
a
change
in
the
rate,
contract
rate
or
otherwise
and
206
(a)
is
for
the
commission
or
a
complaining
party
to
use.
now,
the
procedural
difference
is
that
under
section
205,
the
utility
must
not
only
ask
for
a
change,
it
must
say,
"we
want
to
change
--
we
want
this
rate
changed
to
a
particular
rate
and
must
file
that
rate."
and
it
has
a
burden
of
proof
of
establishing
that
rate
and
that
is
quite
reasonable
in
view
of
the
utility's
knowledge
of
its
own
affairs.
under
206
(a),
neither
the
commission
or
a
complaining
party
is
obliged
to
propose
a
substitute
rate
of
--
the
filing
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
excuse
me.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
exactly
what
the
--
our
commission
would
do.
the
point
is
that
the
act
says
that
when
the
utility
wants
to
change
it,
it
must
propose
the
substitute.
i
don't
think
the
reasoning
of
the
commission
or
its
approach
to
the
problem
is
any
different
under
one
than
the
other.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
--
that
is
exactly
my
point.
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
below
to
read
into
the
act
a
special
treatment
for
contracts
which
are
treated
in
court
and
the
terms
with
other
rates,
because
a
reasonable
contract
rate
it
might
be
displaced
by
a
higher
reasonable
rate.
the
--
the
fear
of
the
court
below
was
imaginary.
under
either
procedure,
the
end
result
is
going
to
be
the
reasonable
rate
fixed
by
the
commission.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
all
right.
that
is
exactly
what
i'm
coming
to.
the
difference
in
a
fact
of
the
two
procedures
pairs
in
the
determination
of
what
is
to
happen
while
the
subject
is
being
litigated.
and
section
205
(e)
says
that
the
utility
can't
have
its
change
for
five
months
if
the
commission
suspends.
and
after
that,
it
may
collect
the
--
the
increased
rate,
but
it
has
to
refund
any
portion
that
is
not
reasonable.
so
there
isn't
any
possibility
under
section
205
(e)
of
the
utility
collecting
anything
in
excess
of
the
rate
which
the
commission
ultimately
decides
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case
pending
the
litigation,
the
rate
went
into
effect.
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
was
ordered
to
account
for
the
increase
and
be
prepared
to
refund
it
with
interest.
it
was
impossible
for
sierra
to
bear
a
cause
for
power
under
this
procedure
in
excess
of
the
commission
determined
reasonable
rate.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
it
is
very
definitely
a
distinction.
and
i
think
that
it
--
it
is
very
apparent
that
the
problem
on
the
mobile
case
arises
from
this
failure
--
elimination
of
the
power
of
suspension
in
that
proviso
and
if
that
--
if
there
is
any
question
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
natural
gas
act,
it
would
be
more
reasonable
to
consider
whether
congress
intended
to
eliminate
the
refund
procedure
under
the
gas
act
of
--
rather
than
to
question
whether
congress
intended
to
eliminate
the
use
of
the
file
rate
procedure
for
initiating
changes
in
contract
rates,
because
there's
nothing
inequitable
about
the
file
rate
procedure
as
such.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
as
far
as
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
as
far
as
the
wording
of
the
--
with
respect
to
filings
is
concerned,
they
are
identical.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
i
don't
think
there
is
any.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
are
--
are
you
talking
about
--
excuse
me,
are
you
talking
about
the
difference
between
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
i
--
the
end
result
would
be
the
same
except
for
the
--
the
right
of
the
utility
to
collect
subject
to
refund
during
the
205
proceeding.
it's
only
the
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
until
--
at
--
until
the
end
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
right.
and
as
mr.
warren
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
no.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
no,
i
didn't.
i
do
not.
i'm
convinced
that
there
is
none.
i'm
satisfied
that
the
end
--
end
result
is
to
be
the
same
under
either
procedure
that
the
commission
--
that
the
reasonable
rate
does
not
depend
upon
the
procedure
to
be
followed.
and
that
congress
has
provided
that
where
the
utility
of
desires
to
propose
a
change,
it
shall
be
permitted
this
equitable
procedure
to
minimize
delay
--
to
minimize
the
burden
of
delay
by
collecting
its
proposed
increase
subject
to
refund
while
the
proceeding
goes
on.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
in
my
opinion,
the
congress
did
not
intend
contracts
to
have
any
weight
and
it
should
not.
they
--
they
represent
the
agreement
of
the
parties
as
to
the
reasonable
rate.
but
they
could
not
have
been
intended
that
the
commission's
determination
of
the
reasonable
rate
should
be
attracted
or
controlled
or
limited
by
the
fact
that
one
party
or
the
other
or
both
thought
that
this
was
a
reasonable
rate.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
expressed
provision,
but
that
certainly
was
the
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
well
i
said
that
no
--
that
is
right.
no
contract
can
be
changed
without
the
acquiescence
of
the
commission
either
through
a
acceptance
of
a
filing
or
a
determination.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
no,
the
--
the
original
interstate
commerce
act
as
i
understand
it
did
not
--
did
not
refer
to
contracts.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
no.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
i
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
the
--
there
is
a
room
for
--
where
utility
has
a
file
rate
to
make
a
contract
to
meet
a
special
situation,
but
it
cannot
control
or
be
determinative
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
--
that
is
right.
and
that
--
the
--
unless
it
refers
to
the
accept
clause
as
far
as
the
--
the
existence
of
the
notice
period
is
concerned.
the
commission
may
shorten
or
eliminate
the
notice
period
if
it
desired.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
right.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
i
believe
is
--
is
right.
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
congress
intended
that
contracts
should
be
treated
exactly
on
a
par
with
other
rates
and
that
the
only
reason
the
court
below
reached
the
contrary
conclusion
was
that
it
thought
the
result
might
be
different
in
substance
because
it
thought
and
its
opinion
is
very
clear
on
this
that
a
reasonable
contract
rate
might
be
displaced
by
a
higher
reasonable
rate.
and
i
say
hat
the
commission's
determination
with
respect
to
the
utility's
filings
that
it
is
reasonable
is
a
determination
that
any
other
rate
is
unreasonable
that
that
is
necessarily
so.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
no.
i
--
i
take
the
position
that
the
contract
is
effective
so
long
as
it
is
filed,
so
long
as
it
is
unchanged
that
either
party
may
institute
a
proceeding
before
the
commission
to
change
the
contract
whenever
that
contract
becomes
unreasonable
because
the
utility
is
not
entitled
to
maintain
and
the
statute
very
clearly
provides
it.
it's
not
entitled
to
maintain
conditions
of
service
that
are
unjust
and
unreasonable.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
right.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
right.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
i'd
say
a
contract
may
constitute
a
representation
by
the
parties
that
they
think
that's
the
reasonable
rate
to
start
with.
we
say
that
it's
very
clear
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
no,
not
at
all.
i
say
that
my
view
is
that
the
congress
has
set
up
a
statutory
process
by
which
a
contract
rate
by
like
all
other
rates
may
be
changed
that
is
very
reasonable
and
rational
process,
no
question
as
to
its
constitutionality
and
the
courts
and
other
jurisdictions
as
mr.
wahrenbrock
has
shown
it
had
no
difficulty
in
reaching
this
conclusion
with
respect
to
statutes
of
this
type.
the
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
right.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
it's
put
into
effect
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
no,
it
--
it
--
went
into
effect,
first,
we
had
to
file
it
60
days
in
advance
to
the
day
we
desired
it
to
go
into
effect.
then
the
commission
suspended
it
for
five
months
after
that
date.
the
determination
of
the
--
of
the
five
months
period,
the
commission
allowed
it
to
go
into
effect
but
subject
to
refund
so
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
retain
any
amount
in
excess
of
what
the
commission
finally
determined
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
they
have
very
clearly
and
expressly
after
hearing
in
which
every
contention
advanced
by
sierra
in
this
case
was
considered
and
disposed
of.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
if
our
position
is
correct,
there
should
be
no
other
hearing
at
all.
there
is
no
--
no
occasion
for
any
other
hearing.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
their
only
contention
is
that
the
filing
was
invalid,
and
that
therefore,
we
are
not
entitled
to
collect
even
the
reasonable
rate
of
--
until
after
the
commission
had
made
a
determination
at
the
conclusion
of
a
section
206
(a)
proceeding.
there's
no
question
but
that
the
commission
found
that
the
rate
was
reasonable
in
this
case
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
do
not
have
time
to
anticipate
what
i
supposed
would
be
the
arguments
that
mr.
chanler
attacking
the
commission's
findings.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
the
refund
provision
is
a
standard
one,
i
believe
with
the
public
utilities
--
with
the
federal
power
commission
that
provides
for
a
refund
to
sierra.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sierra
has
not
made
any
corresponding
increase
to
its
customers
of
a
fact
which
i
think
it's
immaterial
here,
but
i
believe
it
felt
that
it
wasn't
necessary.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
if
--
if
the
commission
--
if
the
commission's
order
that
the
new
rate
is
reasonable,
were
set
aside
and
i
take
it
then
the
matter
would
have
to
be
returned
to
the
commission
to
determine
what
is
the
reasonable
rate.
and
if
these
refund
provisions
were
applied,
the
order
says
that
it
should
go
back
to
sierra
or
if
they
have
passed
it
on
to
any
of
their
wholesale
customers
which
are
very
minor
in
amount,
then
i
believe
it
would
go
back
to
their
--
to
any
wholesale
customers
of
theirs
of
the
actual
words
are
those
entitled
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
that
is
page
442.
the
number
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
it's
the
record
in
the
sierra
case.
mr.
f.
t.
searls
it's
not
otherwise
provided
by
state
commission's
action.
those
entitled
of
the
benefit
of
the
refund
shall
be
the
retail
customer
served
by
sierra.
it
says
it
can
buy
its
wholesale
customers
of
--
to
the
--
except
to
the
extent
that
the
benefit
of
the
(inaudible)
any
differences
shall
previously
have
been
passed
along
to
them.
i
would
expect
sierra's
position
to
be
that
since
he
did
not
made
any
offsetting
increase
in
its
own
rates
that
would
keep
the
entire
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
yes.
i
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
well
that
is
--
that
is
true.
and
i
should
say
that
--
i
believe
sierra's
position
is
that
the
refund
provision
should
never
come
into
play
because
their
position
is
that
--
has
no
valid
filing
to
start
with
and
were
out
of
court
because
we
took
the
long
--
wrong
writ
is
what
i'm
saying.
i
would
like
to
add
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
i'd
like
to
say
that
--
mr.
f.
t.
searls
--
answers
on
the
--
answers
to
mr.
chanler's
position
on
the
questions
of
fact
are
contained
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
hope
they
will
fully
answer
that.
