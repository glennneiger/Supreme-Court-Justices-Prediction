if
the
court
please.
the
argument
in
this
case
falls
into
two
very
distinct
categories.
the
first
is
a
jurisdictional
threshold
question
relating
to
justiciability
and
the
second
is
the
merit
of
the
attack,
the
constitutional
attack
upon
the
statute
involved.
i
will
discuss
for
the
court
the
threshold
question
and
my
associate
mrs.
freedman
will
discuss
the
merits
when
i
have
finished.
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
the
district
director
of
immigration
and
naturalization
in
the
third
immigration
district,
which
is
where
these
appellants
had
deportation
orders
began
against
him
and
where
the
action
against
these
appellants
which
is
being
here
contested
was
began.
the
appellants
are
all
aliens.
there
are
outstanding
orders
of
deportation
against
these
aliens.
the
grounds
of
the
deportation
orders
were
membership
after
entry
into
the
united
states
of
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states.
the
validity
of
these
orders
of
deportation
are
not
being
contested
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
more
than
six
months
have
elapsed
since
the
issuance
of
the
final
administrative
orders
of
deportation.
in
fact,
much
more
than
six
months
has
elapsed.
these
orders
have
not
been
effectuated
because
they
either
may
not
or
cannot
in
fact
be
effectuated.
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
by
section
242
(d)
thereof,
that's
found
in
title
viii
section
1252
(d),
provides
in
section
(a)
--
well,
at
least
1252
provides
in
section
(a)
and
(b)
for
that
period
of
time
before
the
issuance
of
a
final
administrative
order
of
deportation
and
for
time
up
to
six
months
after
a
final
order
of
deportation.
the
contested
section
1252
(d)
governs
that
time
after
six
months
after
the
making
an
issuance
of
a
final
order
of
deportation.
the
provisions
of
that
statute
are
that
aliens
in
such
circumstances
may
be
subjected
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
to
what
is
called
supervision.
they
may
be
supervised
in
four
ways
under
the
terms
of
that
statute.
they
may
be
required
to
report
for
identification.
they
may
be
required
to
submit
to
medical
and
psychiatric
examination
when
called
and
if
necessary.
they
may
be
required
to
give
information
under
oath
concerning
their
nationality,
circumstances,
habits,
associations
and
activities
and
any
other
question
deemed
fit
and
proper
by
the
attorney
general,
whether
or
not
it
relates
to
the
enumerated
class
in
that
subsection.
then
there
is
a
carte
blanche
section,
whereby
the
attorney
general
is
given
the
power
to
impose
such
other
restrictions
on
the
conduct
and
activity
of
those
aliens
as
he
may
deem
fit
and
proper.
the
attorney
general,
after
the
passage
of
this
act,
delegated
the
power
granted
to
him
by
section
1252
(d)
to
the
district
director
of
immigration
in
the
district
where
the
appellant
had
either,
theretofore
been
retained,
maintained
or
released
on
bail
or
parole
conditions.
the
delegation
of
power
to
the
district
director
is
in
words
or
substantially
in
words
of
section
1252
(d)
itself.
the
regulation
does
not
provide
for
any
procedure
for
the
modification
of
an
order
of
supervision
which
is
issued
under
the
regulation.
it
does
not
provide
for
appeal.
it
makes
--
it
sets
up
and
creates
no
administrative
remedy
by
which
the
validity
or
the
reasonableness
of
an
order
of
supervision
may
be
contested.
this
as
the
court
shall
see
will
become
important
in
terms
of
the
argument
made
by
the
government
on
justiciability.
the
appellants
here
were
placed
under
orders
of
supervision
when
six
months
had
elapsed
after
the
issuance
of
their
deportation
orders.
ms.
gloria
agrin
the
order
is
handed
to
them
sir.
they
are
usually
requested
to
sign
an
order
of
a
--
clause
at
the
end
of
it,
which
says
they
understand
what
the
order
means.
these
appellants,
although
they
accepted
the
orders
when
they
were
handed
to
them
did
not
sign,
stating
among
other
reasons
that
they
did
no
understand
what
the
order
meant.
ms.
gloria
agrin
some
of
them
had
and
some
of
them
had
not.
for
instance,
mr.
sklar
had
been
in
jail
just
prior
to
the
issuance
of
this
order.
ms.
gloria
agrin
they
are
all
out
under
the
orders
of
supervision.
the
statute,
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
does
not
permit
the
attorney
general
to
detain
them
after
the
six
months
period.
ms.
gloria
agrin
yes,
sir.
ms.
gloria
agrin
that
is
correct.
there
is
gannet,
bittleman,
and
jones
--
ms.
gloria
agrin
well,
this
--
at
least
two
of
these
people,
bittleman
and
gannet
are
what
one
would
call
stateless
people,
so
that
these
orders
would
be
in
effect
upon
their
release
from
prison.
as
to
ms.
jones,
it's
quite
likely
that
it
would
be
moot.
as
a
matter
fact
she
is
to
be
released
from
jail
this
sunday
and
is
subject
to
deportation
because
she
is
a
citizen
--
or
subject
to
the
british
west
indies.
ms.
gloria
agrin
it
is
the
second
group
of
appellants,
your
honor.
ms.
gloria
agrin
gannet
--
ms.
gloria
agrin
--
bittleman
and
jones.
ms.
gloria
agrin
the
orders
of
supervision
were
handed
to
each
of
the
individual
appellants
here.
the
orders
were
made
for
each
individual.
it
was
not
a
blanket
regulation
posted
on
a
bulletin
board
in
the
immigration
service.
it's
as
if
they
had
been
served
with
any
process
of
either
the
administrative
agency
or
of
a
court.
they
provided
substantially
the
same
things.
there
were
differences
among
the
individuals
but
substantially,
they
required
that
the
alien
report
to
an
agent
of
the
administrative
--
of
the
immigration
service
at
ellis
island
once
weekly.
ms.
gloria
agrin
yes,
sir.
ms.
gloria
agrin
if
the
court
please.
i
was
at
a
point
of
describing
the
provisions
of
the
orders
of
supervision
which
were
drawn
and
issued
by
the
appellee
herein
to
each
of
the
appellants.
one
provision
which
was
constant
throughout
all
of
the
orders
was
a
requirement
that
the
appellee
--
each
of
the
appellants
report
to
an
officer
of
the
immigration
service
once
weekly
on
ellis
island
to
new
york
harbor.
after
these
actions
were
began
in
the
court
below,
that
provision
was
changed
to
once
monthly
and
when
for
budgetary
reasons,
the
ellis
island
establishment
was
closed,
the
place
of
reporting
was
changed
to
some
place
on
the
island
of
manhattan
at
70
columbus
avenue.
the
orders
further
require
the
aliens
to
notify
the
service
of
change
of
residence
and
change
of
employment
within
48
hours
after
such
change
is
made.
the
appellants
are
also
required
to
apply
for
permission
for
a
change
of
residence
from
the
third
immigration
district
to
any
other
immigration
district
in
the
country.
they
are
required
also
by
the
order
to
report
for
psychiatric
and
medical
examination
when
it
is
necessary
and
to
give
such
information
as
may
be
deemed
fit
and
proper
under
oath.
in
more
than
half
of
the
orders,
the
appellants
are
prohibited
from
going
outside
of
an
area
within
50
miles
from
times
square
in
new
york,
i
assume
as
the
crow
flies.
each
of
the
order
contains
a
directive
that
the
alien
terminate
membership
in
the
communist
party
per
se
or
association
with
the
communist
party
per
se,
or
any
of
its
branches,
subdivisions
or
affiliates,
either
here
or
in
any
other
country.
another
section
of
the
order
requires
that
the
alien
terminate
associations
with
any
individuals
they
know
to
be
communists
or
who
aid
and
further
the
policies
and
doctrines
of
the
communist
party.
there
was
an
exception
made
for
spouses
and
attorneys,
provided
however
that
association
with
such
spouse
or
attorney
is
not
done
in
furtherance
of
the
doctrines
or
the
policies
of
the
communist
party,
of
any
of
its
branches,
subdivisions
or
geographical
differentiations.
the
aliens
are
also
directed
by
the
order,
which
subjects
them
of
course
to
criminal
penalty
for
violation
of
it
within
a
--
with
an
additional
criminal
penalty
not
to
violate
the
smith
act
or
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
after
these
orders
were
issued
to
each
of
these
appellants,
the
actions
which
the
appeal
is
being
taken
from
were
commenced
in
the
district
court
under
title
v
section
1009,
the
appellants
contending
that
they
were
parties
aggrieved
by
the
administrative
order
of
the
appellee.
these
actions
asked
for
the
relief
authorized
by
section
1009
(b)
of
declaratory
judgment
and
auxiliary
injunctive
relief.
they
asked
that
the
statute
in
question
1252
(d),
the
regulation
promulgated
under
the
statute
8
c.f.r.
242.3
(c),
as
applied
by
the
orders
of
supervision
issued
to
each
of
these
plaintiffs
was
unconstitutional.
they
also
asked
that
the
district
director,
the
appellant
--
appellee,
be
directed
to
cancel
the
orders
and
be
directed
not
to
seek
compliance
with
them
and
not
to
enforce
them.
temporary
stays
of
varying
kinds
were
granted
by
the
individual
judges
to
whom
orders
--
orders
to
show
cause
were
directed.
the
government
made
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
there
was
the
failure
to
join
an
improper
party,
on
the
ground
further
that
it
did
not
play
the
cause
of
action
and
to
vacate
the
temporary
restraining
orders
which
were
exempt
at
that
time.
they
also
asked
for
the
convocation
of
a
three-judge
court
under
28
u.s.c.
2282
and
2284.
the
appellants
did
not
oppose
the
convocation
of
a
three-judge
court.it
was
convened
--
it
consisted
of
circuit
judge
medina
and
district
judges
mcgohey
and
weinfeld.
they
reheard
argument
on
june
30th,
1954.
in
october
of
1954,
they
handed
down
their
decision
which
granted
the
relief
requested
by
the
government
on
the
sole
ground
that
there
was
no
present
case
and
controversy
between
the
party's
plaintiff
and
the
party's
defendant.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
did
not
reach
the
merits.
it
is
the
appellant's
contention
--
ms.
gloria
agrin
we
have
brought
an
action
only
under
the
administrative
procedures
act.
the
second
paragraph
of
section
1009
says
that
such
an
action
may
be
brought
in
many
forms,
in
the
form
of
a
declaratory
judgment,
in
the
form
of
an
injunction
action,
in
the
form
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
which
does
not
--
is
involved
here.
but
it
is
not
being
brought
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
as
such.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case
prevent
--
present
a
classic
example
of
a
justiciable
case
in
controversy,
the
lower
court
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding.
the
main
thrust
of
our
argument
on
the
merits,
as
mrs.
freedman
shall
show,
is
that
it
is
unlawful
and
unconstitutional
to
restrict
the
conduct
and
activities
of
these
appellants
under
this
statute
1252
(d),
under
the
regulation
promulgated
under
the
statute
as
applied
to
each
of
these
appellants
by
the
orders
of
supervision
issued
severally
against
each
of
them.
this
in
effect
is
the
only
issue.
there
are
many
reasons
why
our
contention
--
reasons
urged
for
our
contentions
of
unlawfulness
and
unconstitutionality.
but
the
only
issue
is
the
issue
relating
to
the
validity
of
the
statute
as
applied.
in
relation
to
this,
the
government
concedes
and
you
will
find
it
at
pages
26
of
their
brief
and
at
32
and
33,
and
i
quote
from
page
26,
"this
one
issue
seems
to
meet
the
minimum
constitutional
requirements
of
a
case
or
controversy.”
the
appellants
grow
up
from
this.
the
logical
conclusion
therefore
that
the
controversy
should
be
decided.
the
government,
on
the
other
hand,
engages
in
what
i
would
consider
a
futile
search
to
find
reasons
why
the
controversy
should
not
be
decided.
it
will
be
interesting
for
the
court
to
note
that
the
government
abandons
the
position
of
the
court
below
as
to
why
this
case
and
controversy
should
not
be
decided.
the
court
below
had
found
that
there
was
no
present
controversy
for
the
reason
that
the
orders
of
supervision
were
not
self-executed.
i
call
only
briefly
to
the
court's
attention,
its
decision
in
columbia
broadcasting
system
against
the
united
states,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that's
at
316
u.s,
where
this
court
said,
"the
regulations
are
not
less
reviewable
because
their
promulgation
did
not
operate
of
their
own
force.
when
they
are
promulgated
by
order,
they
are
appropriately
subject
of
attack.”
the
same
doctrine
is
carried
through
in
enumerable
decisions,
among
them
parker
against
fleming,
la
crosse
telephone
against
wisconsin
employment
board
and
the
several
others
that
are
cited
in
our
brief.
so
that
in
this
respect,
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
is
obviously
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
previously
held.
the
second
ground,
which
one
would
assume
that
the
court
relied
on,
was
that
this
appellant
was
not
an
adverse
--
this
appellee
was
not
an
adverse
party
to
the
appellant
for
the
reason
that
the
statute
becomes
enforceable
by
criminal
sanctions.
this
court
too,
when
i
called
to
its
attention,
its
decision
in
rochester
telephone
company
in
307
u.s.
and
shields
against
utah
railroad
company
in
305
u.s.,
to
the
effect
that
even
in
relation
to
a
statute
where
the
sanctions
are
criminal,
the
order
itself
is
considered
part
of
the
regulatory
scheme.
and
the
issuance
of
the
order
by
the
administrator
makes
that
administrator
an
adverse
party
and
properly
so.
it
is
another
reason
that
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
wrong.
i
should
like
to
turn
only
for
a
few
moments
to
the
positions
adapted
by
the
government
instead
of
the
position
of
the
court
below.
they
seem
to
fall
into
two
minor
categories
and
one
major
category,
and
i
applied
the
characterization
of
the
government.
i,
myself,
can't
distinguish
why
one
is
minor
and
the
other
is
major.
one
of
the
minor
categories
and
reasons
that
the
government
says
that
this
case
should
not
presently
be
decided
is
because
the
appellants
have
not
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies.
i
have
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
neither
the
statute
nor
the
code
of
federal
regulation
establishes
any
remedy
for
either
the
modification
of
the
orders
of
supervision,
once
they
are
issued
by
the
district
director
or
from
an
appeal
from
the
orders
for
any
reason
whether
the
grounds
of
unconstitutionality
or
on
the
grounds
of
unreasonableness.
the
government's
argument
boils
down
simply
to
this,
that
this
appellant
had
not
begged
the
district
director
to
change.
they
have
not
gone
in
and
said
look,
this
creates
terrible
problems
for
me,
and
if
the
district
director
had
a
good
breakfast
and
felt
well
that
morning,
he
might
change
it.
it
has
never
been
my
experience,
and
i
have
found
no
case
in
this
court
where
begging,
pleading
or
shouting
over
a
telephone
was
considered
an
administrative
remedy
that
had
to
be
exhausted
before
review
could
be
held
in
the
federal
courts.
i
would
challenge
the
government
to
find
a
regulation,
a
written
rule
which
gives
these
appellants
some
recourse
from
the
order
once
it
has
been
issued.
there
is
none.
there
is
no
administrative
procedure
that
needs
to
be
exhausted
before
going
into
the
courts.
the
second
minor
premise
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
many
of
the
appellant's
contentions
are
remote
and
speculative.
i
submit
that
this
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
government
can
only
be
drawn
from
a
misapprehension
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
appellants.
one
of
the
grounds
urged
for
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
phase
and
as
applied,
is
that
the
statute
is
vague
and
indefinite
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
their
brief,
the
appellants
have
tried
to
show
the
manner
in
which
the
words
used
are
as
broad
as
to
create
confusion
as
to
what
the
duties
and
obligations
of
each
of
the
individual
appellants
might
be
under
them.
that
some
or
all
of
these
things
may
be
--
may
happen,
as
it
may
happen
under
any
vague
statute,
is
not
to
be
contested
but
we
have
a
present
claim.
a
present
claim
to
the
vagueness
of
the
statute
and
we
do
not
ask
that
future
possibilities
under
this
vague
statute
be
--
be
enjoined.
we
ask
that
now,
this
statute
that
is
perfectly
bad
because
of
its
vagueness
be
struck
down.
and
that,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
sir,
is
the
argument
to
the
remote
and
speculative
contention
of
the
government
as
--
as
it
relates
to
our
claim.
the
government
seeks
to
avoid
its
major
concession
as
to
justiciability
by
the
judicious
use
of
artful
adjectives.
they
say,
yes,
you
have
a
case
in
controversy.
they
say,
yes,
you
have
adverse
parties.
they
say,
yes,
an
order,
a
judgment
of
a
court
can
solve
the
controversy
between
you.
but
they
say
it
shouldn't
do
it
here
because
there
is
no
concrete
factual
background.
our
constitutional
issues
they
say
are
ill-defined.
and
they
cite
as
authority
for
not
accepting
review
of
the
case,
the
cases
of
united
public
workers
against
mitchell
and
the
international
longshoremen
against
boyd.
those
were
the
factual
situations
of
those
two
cases.
they
are
not
of
this
case.
the
appellant
contends
that
we
have
here
against
each
of
the
appellants
a
final
administrative
order,
saved
of
course,
if
they
are
required
to
beg
for
a
change.
it
commands
each
of
the
appellants
to
do
or
refrain
from
doing
certain
specified
act.

contend

from
the
day
of
its
issuance,
they
were
required
to
work
up
to
the
immigration
service
and

they
are
called
on
the
telephone
or
notified
by

that
they
must
come
in
for

they
must
--

take
themselves
to
the
immigration
service
and
submit
to

ms.
gloria
agrin
they
have
been
asked
to
do
so,
sir,
and
the
record
indicates
that.
ms.
gloria
agrin
well,
this
court
has
said
before
that
the
limitation
stems
from
the
order
itself,
which
they
are
not
required
to
violate.
ms.

the
freedom
of
locomotion,
the
freedom
of
moving
from
one
place
to
the
other,
the
freedom
of
associating
with
people
whom
they
may
choose
otherwise
to
associate.
ms.

there
is
that.
they
cannot
change
their
place
of
residence
without
permission
of
the
administrator.

as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
some
--
some
three
of
the
appellants
here
applied
for
permission
to
come
down
and
listen
to
this
argument.
and
they
were
denied
for
a
--
it
was
denied
over
a
period
of
almost
a
week
and
only
we
learned
today
from
mr.
(inaudible)
that
--
late
yesterday,
that
permission
was
granted.
but
it
required
the
attention
of
an
attorney
to
intervene
with
the
service
to
get
them
to
offer
permission
to
come
down
and
hear
the
arguments
here
today.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
where
we
have
us
here
a
final
order
with
specific
directions
against
the
appellants.
where
the
appellants
say
there
is
no
right
to
impose
this
order,
and
the
respondents
say
that
they
do
have
a
right.
and
where
an
order
of
this
court
could
satisfactorily
conclude
the
controversy,
there
is
here
a
justiciable
case
and
controversy
which
this
court
ought
to
decide
on
the
merits.
