justice
felix
frankfurter
have
they
been
out
on
bail
at
the
time
the
order
was
served?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
automatically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
trouble
you
to
name
the
people
who
are
in
jail,
who
are
now
physically
detained
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
gannet,
bittleman
and
jones.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
if
they're
asked
to
--
if
they
are
asked
to
do
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
require
the
initiation
against
them
rather
than
any
limitations
thereto?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
freedom
is
limited
as
of
the
vagueness
of
the
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can't
travel
outside
the
60
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
if
one
of
these
defendants
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
the
statutory
determination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
--
like
you
to
state
if
you
will
your
view
of
the
power
of
the
government
for
--
of
deportation
of
the
government
to
deport
after
the
six
months
period
is
applied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
you
agree
to
use
that
there
is
no
constitutional
difficulty
about
the
government
enforcing
this
outstanding
deportation
order
six
months
after
they
found
or
(inaudible)
in
order
to
hear
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
the
(inaudible)
suppose
congress
instead
of
they
having
made
this
provision
limited
by
six
months,
they've
set
it
after
nine
months.
the
government
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
congress
had
said
eight
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
that
that
is
too
long
of
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
of
the
year.
i'm
trying
to
found
out
what
the
--
what
the
relationship
if
any
between
what
you
acknowledge
as
a
constitutional
power
to
deport
at
anytime
without
limits,
if
they
could
send
this
alien
to
some
place
they
could
take
him
or
to
some
place
that
he's
ready
to
go.
and
take
charge
of
the
government
and
the
wisdom
of
congress
to
have
the
alien
available
if
and
when
such
distant
time
arrives.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
you.
if
--
how
could
it
be
indefinite,
suppose
the
alien
is
a
frenchman,
a
french
or
romanian
nationality,
i
don't
care
what
country
(inaudible)
and
the
country
of
his
nationality
refuses
to
give
him
the
necessary
--
to
give
the
government
the
necessary
legal
accordance
and
he
doesn't
(inaudible)
voluntarily.
first,
what
kind
of
situation
do
you
see
in
which
we
arrive
in
a
more
hypothetical
case
(inaudible)
taken
one
day
and
two
months
within
the
six
months
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
understand
imprisonment
(inaudible)
but
you
mean
to
say
because
the
soviet
union
deferred
four
months
after
his
deportation
order
is
out,
we
won't
have
him
and
thereafter
he
can't
be
deported
ever?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
can
understand
a
court
says
it
is
too
harsh
or
whatever
they
say
to
imprison
but
i
do
not
understand
that
--
that
thereby
the
power
to
deport
which
i
now
understand
you,
the
power
to
deport
doesn't
evaporate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
soviet
union
may
change
its
mind,
they
may
apply
to
become
--
making
up
on
a
jury
and
(inaudible)
and
they
may
decide
to
take
it.
definitely,
that
was
before
them.
now,
my
question
is
(inaudible),
what
in
your
view
is
the
power,
is
there
any
power
in
the
government
adding
the
completed
power
through
this
court,
what
power
does
the
government
proceed
through,
that
if
and
when
the
case
is
put
in
court
and
arises
that
an
alien
there
immediately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
time
comes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
maybe
--
he
maybe
be
merged
(inaudible)
of
the
american
people
on
the
go
and
(inaudible)
and
that's
all
there
is,
and
then
there
is
--
somebody
have
to
get
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can
see
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
or
may
not.
(inaudible)
and
liberty
restricts
it
but
he's
in
a
very
good
position
from
the
man
who
is
not
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
you're
not
contesting
deportability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
is
that
the
government
having
the
power
that
an
alien
is
in
this
country
illegally,
that's
what
deportability
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
alien
in
this
country
is
illegal
and
therefore
his
presence
in
this
country
should
determine
and
yet
you
say
why
that
is
so
and
while
there
are
difficulties,
while
the
time
hasn't
come
when
the
government
can
exercise
that
power,
it
has
no
other
means
of
assuring
itself
the
opportunity
that
that
people
are
taking
except
by
giving
him
notice
when
the
time
comes
and
deliver
himself
up,
that's
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
did
you
say
without
judicial
process?
what
could
a
judicial
process
do?
what
could
it
decide
whether
there's
probability
that
the
soviet
union
or
france,
or
romania
would
change
its
mind,
or
whether
he
is
a
good
risk.
and
there's
no
likelihood
that
he
will
not
turn
himself
up?
what
would
be
the
issue
before
a
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
truly
possible
to
say
that
you
--
you
can
deport
him
but
you
can't
put
him
in
jail?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
crime?
that
is
the
question
of
whether
you've
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
practically
what
my
doing
by
what
might
we
call
the
administrative
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mrs.
freedman,
the
government
(inaudible)
the
statute,
requiring
that
you
and
i
or
anybody
else,
(inaudible)
i
would
doubt
it
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
say
they
can't
do
it
if
(inaudible)
now
why
can
he
have
restricted
freedom
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
way
they
can't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
can't
even
ask
him
to
let
him
know
any
case
was
raised?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can
make
--
they
have
no
power
to
ask
you,
to
let
him
know
every
time
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
admit
a
constitutionality,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
and
you
must
--
that
will
imply
that
you
think
that
that
is
--
that
that
is
an
allowable
incidental
power
for
the
government
through
its
conceded
power
to
deport,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
the
question
is
whether
there
is
any
allowable
--
whether
the
relation
(inaudible)
what
this
provision,
this
subsection
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
this
subsection
does,
whether
there
is
any
allowable
justifiable
relation
between
whether
in
this
subsection
and
the
conceded
bound
before.
that's
the
real
question
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
--
then
--
then
all
these
actions
about
what
liberty
is
really
doesn't
help
settle
this
case
--
decide
the
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that's
a
self-evident
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
because
i'm
in
too
much
need,
i'm
establishing
all
the
--
all
the
other,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
--
it
may
and
the
question
is
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
suggest
to
you
that
this
absolutely
is
your
argument.
don't
get
anywhere
with
(inaudible)
but
it
seems
to
me
a
very
futile
way
of
arguing
the
case,
when
it
comes
to
the
argument
(inaudible)
the
government
isn't
here
saying
because
they
can
deport
him,
they
can
impose
any
condition.
the
government
isn't
here
to
say
they
can
therefore
determine
--
have
to
get
the
government's
position
as
to
who
should
marry
who.
the
government
doesn't
say
we
contend
that
we
can
lock
him
up
forever.
we
have
a
very
different
case,
so
there's
an
irrelevant
degree
and
it
would
be
helpful
to
argue
should
be
(inaudible)
degree
instead
of
arguing
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
(inaudible),
before
you
proceed
with
your
argument,
would
you
mind
one
thing
--
would
you
point
out
where
the
provision
is
regarding
the
affiliations,
family?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
aliens
actually
before
us.
so,
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
that
which
is
printed
on
top
of
page
14,
defining
association
applies
to
all
the
(inaudible),
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
could
be
any
reason
why
(inaudible)
all
the
plaintiffs
--
all
the
appellants
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
they
assume
--
maybe
take
it
for
granted
then
but
if
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
we
assume
that
the
orders
that
we're
considering
as
to
all
the
appellants
associated
with
nothing
in
this
litigation,
the
others
are
all
(inaudible)
that
all
the
supervisory
orders
have
a
provision
--
has
a
provision.
the
crime
you're
associating
is
not
--
is
not
to
include
members
of
the
family.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
means
--
may
we
assume
that
if
they're
not
here
now
you
will
include
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
why
shouldn't
it
--
why
should
--
why
should
we
come
with
the
narrow
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it's
important
to
know
because
some
of
us
may
have
trouble
with
it
as
to
the
absence
of
that
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
if
you
have
the
information
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
(inaudible)
about
his
name.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
would
take
that
into
account
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
contesting
to
that
whether
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
(inaudible),
since
the
--
as
you
indicated
in
honor
of
supervision
is
in
part
or
may
in
part
can
be
individualized.
am
i
right
in
inferring
that
there
maybe
specific
provisions
subject
to
challenge
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
really
to
imply
any
criticism
of
(inaudible)
i'm
saying
the
foundation
perfectly.
namely,
that
there
are
these
individual
provisions
as
you
get
into
this
(inaudible)
business
or
different
conceptions
that
the
law
permits
so
that
there
are
individual
instances,
individual
provisions
as
to
which
there
maybe
a
(inaudible)
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
depends
upon
the
individual
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
immigration
procedure
explicitly
provide
for
an
appeal
for
an
administrative
alleviation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
doctrine
definitive
exhaustion
which
in
correction
you
put
is
one
that
you
would
say
as
a
matter
of
good
practice
to
give
administratively
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
no
what
you
call
jurisdictional
bar
against
the
court
pertaining
it
or
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
your
brief
and
you
say
that
you
have
fixed
this
problem
and
you
make
all
the
arguments
again
--
again
showing
that
this
is
a
case
in
controversy.
i,
myself
don't
see
why
this
is
just
like
rochester
telephone
company
if
you
tell
me
i
can't
move
out
of
a
radius
of
50
miles
and
i
say,
i
want
to
move
out
of
the
radius
--
into
a
radius
of
100
miles
without
(inaudible),
why
isn't
that
a
present
restriction
of
my
freedom
to
move
out
of
the
50-mile
radius?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
none
of
your
business.
you're
restricting
my
--
my
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
if
that's
the
(inaudible)
constitutional
right
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
because
the
--
the
decision
on
the
merit
doesn't
determine
the
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
give
you
100
miles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
(inaudible)
that
i
have
the
freedom
to
determine
that
without
your
permission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
and
that
is
not
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
(inaudible),
may
i
--
may
i
recall
to
you
the
case
of
in
re
henry
(inaudible)
he
went
to
jail
because
he
refused
to
pay
taxes.he
refused
to
pay
taxes,
not
because
it
violated
the
due
process
clause
or
legal
protection
in
the
law,
or
that
taxes
must
be
equal
(inaudible)
to
deny
the
power
of
massachusetts
to
impose
a
tax
(inaudible),
let's
say
he
went
to
jail.
now,
if
he
thought
habeas
corpus
was
a
matter
of
justiciable
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
these
people,
having
that
position
as
i
understand
it.
this
was
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
they
are
after.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
administrative
relief
available
because
they
denied
the
right
of
the
administrator
to
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
--
then
there's
another
(inaudible)
judicial
administration
that
you
(inaudible)
if
they
are
properly
important
on
their
main
issue
and
the
say,
“well,
you
could
--
haven't
got
this
even
if
you
do
not
completely
deny
their
power
to
exercise
(inaudible)
unreasonable
way,
once
they're
in
the
court
it
might
--
it
might
be
all
cleaned
up
in
one
condition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
that
it's
perfectly
plain
in
light
of
the
discussions
we've
had
that
this
court
can
possibly
pass
on
those
claims
of
the
affidavit
as
to
particular
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
any
event,
we
can
pass
on
any
of
those
if
they
had
to
back
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
district
court.
justice
felix

but
we
couldn't
affirm
in
any
event
if
we
believe
that
because
(inaudible)
justice

are
the
--
are
the
(inaudible)
more
or
less
repetitive?
justice

are
you
suggesting
that
however
vague
may
be
the
power
of
the
attorney
general,
the
client
and
the
aliens
would

justice

(inaudible)
scope
for
inquiry

the
question
to
the
court
must
have
been
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
recall
the
language
in
the
(inaudible)
case
but
on
the
phase
of
it,
there's
a
great
significance

there
was
