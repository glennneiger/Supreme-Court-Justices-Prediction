ms.
blanch
freedman
if
it
please
the
court.
the
issues
that
are
involved
in
--
in
these
cases
are
a
first
impression.
in
terms
of
legal
postulation,
it
poses
a
question
of
legislative
power.
but
in
terms
of
human
beings
in
a
frame
of
reference
that
encompasses
the
14
persons
now
before
this
court
as
appellants
and
the
enumerable
others
throughout
the
nation
who
are
similarly
situated,
the
problem
presented
today
to
this
court
is
one
that
moved
circuit
judge
anderson
in
1925
in
a
parallel
case
in
re
--
the
petition
of
brooks
to
say,
"slavery
was
abolished
by
the
thirteenth
amendment.‚Äù
the
appellants
are
non-citizens
and
with
the
exception
of
two,
they
are
all
advanced
in
years.
they
have
lived
in
this
country
for
many
years.four
of
them
have
lived
here
for
almost
50
years,
eight
for
over
30,
and
two
for
approximately
17.
they
are
working
men
and
women
with
american
families
and
american
children.
some
have
had
sons
who
have
served
in
--
in
world
war
ii.
one
has
had
a
son
who
was
killed
in
the
battle
of
the
bulge.
they
are
carpenters,
they
are
painters,
they
are
mattress
makers,
they
are
salesman,
clerks,
bookkeepers
in
the
ordinary
works
of
those
who
labor.
now,
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
to
one
and
a
half
years,
each
of
these
appellants
have
been
working
and
living
under
the
oppressive
yoke
of
an
order
of
supervision.
let
me
state
and
describe.
in
some
of
the
cases,
the
order
physically
ties
the
appellant
to
an
area
of
land
that
is
measured
by
a
radius
of
50
miles
beginning
from
times
square
in
the
city
of
new
york.
now,
it
is
this
power
asserted
by
the
government
to
thus
enthrall
these
non-citizens
that
is
being
challenged
here
this
afternoon?
we
submit,
sirs,
that
section
1252
(d)
under
which
the
attorney
general
presumes
to
act
is
--
is
an
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
the
life,
of
the
liberty,
and
property
of
the
appellants.
and
is
unconstitutionally
inflicts
upon
them
punishment.
in
a
lower
line
of
cases,
this
court
has
held
that
non-citizens
are
entitled
in
their
person,
and
in
their
property,
and
in
their
effects
to
the
protection
of
all
the
laws
of
our
land,
including
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
you
gentleman
said
that
in
the
--
in
the
case
of
chu.
you
said
that
in
the
case
of
bridges
against
brickton.
you
said
that
in
the
case
carlson
against
landon,
the
very
case
upon
which
the
government
bottoms
its
entire
support
of
its
position.
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes,
sir.
precisely
that
is
what
--
that
is
the
contention
of
the
--
of
the
appellants.
we
concede
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
--
that
the
power
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
the
entire
subdivision,
1252
(d),
which
i
will
explain
in
a
moment.
the
power
to
deport,
the
power
to
expel
any
alien,
any
non-citizen
that
the
government
so
chooses,
we
concede
is
there.
it's
not
my
--
it's
not
my
purpose
or
my
intent
to
reargue
at
this
time
at
least
to
(inaudible)
ms.
blanch
freedman
we
say,
sir,
that
under
--
under
this
section,
the
government
cannot
supervise
or
regulate
even
including
the
requirement
of
their
physically
reporting
to
them
periodically.
ms.
blanch
freedman
no
supervision
at
all.
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
convince
you
gentlemen
of
the
correctness
of
this
position
by
the
time
my
argument
is
concluded.
ms.
blanch
freedman
oh,
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
law,
sir,
which
gives
the
government
the
address
at
all
times
and
the
whereabouts
at
all
times,
not
only
of
these
non-citizens
but
of
every
non-citizen
to
which
--
to
which
these
appellants
are
also
subject.
so
that
they
are
always
--
that
is
day
by
day,
i
mean,
the
immigration
service,
the
united
states
government
is
always
in
possession
of
the
immediate
current
address
and
whereabouts
of
the
appellant.
ms.
blanch
freedman
no,
we
are
not
raising.
that
is
the
part
of
the
alien
registration
act,
which
carries
penalties
all
of
its
own.
now,
the
power
to
detain
or
otherwise
restrain
the
liberty
of
non-citizens
without
judicial
trial
had
been
sanctioned
by
this
court,
but
only
as
an
incident
to
the
power
to
deport,
only
as
an
incident
to
the
power
to
deport
or
in
making
arrange
--
actual
arrangements
for
deportation.
this
court
held
in
the
case
carlson
against
landon
and
intimated
it
again
in
the
case
of
wong
wing
against
the
united
states.
that
the
power
to
deport
carried
with
it
the
power
to
detain
an
alien
pending
deportation
proceeding.
pending
arrangements
for
actual
deportation,
so
that
the
united
states
government
during
deportation
proceeding
can
keep
incarcerated,
keep
imprisoned
a
non-citizen
from
the
day
of
--
the
day
that
he
serves
the
warrant
for
arrest
to
deportation
until
the
final
expiration
of
a
finding
of
deportability
and
for
an
additional
period
to
prepare
and
make
arrangements
for
their
actual
departure.
but
this
court
has
also
said
that
the
political
power
to
deport
cannot
and
may
not
be
used
to
deprive
a
non-citizen
of
liberty
or
inflict
punishment
upon
them.
and
they
cannot
do
that
even
to
a
non-citizen
who
has
been
found
deportable.
i
think
in
the
case
of
mezei
against
the
united
states,
it
appears
on
page
25
of
my
brief
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
it's
mezei
against
shaughnessy.
the
circuit
court
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
oh,
we
don't
raise
the
six
months
period.
we
will
concede
that
during
the
six
months
period
from
the
time
a
finding
of
deportability
is
administratively
made.
and
for
a
period
of
six
months,
it
may
well
be
that
that
is
a
reasonable
time
in
which
to
hold
a
non-citizen
who
has
been
found
deportable
in
custody
while
you
are
making
arrangements
for
deportation.
but
the
law
recognizes
that
there
may
come
a
period,
and
they
have
said
that
that
period
comes
at
the
end
of
the
six
months
--
upon
the
expiration
of
the
six
months.
that
you
cannot
deport
--
that
you
cannot
deport
a
non-citizen.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
right
and
that
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
the
government
always
has
a
power
to
deport,
sir.
ms.
blanch
freedman
but
it
maybe
that
that
power
to
deport
becomes
inviable
for
a
period
of
one
year,
five
years,
and
in
the
case
of
this
appellant,
it
may
be
for
the
balance
of
their
--
of
their
lives.
when
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
--
no
question
about
that,
sir.
the
--
a
warrant
for
deportation
would
--
would
be
rejuvenated
the
moment
the
government
was
in
a
position
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
the
--
they
arrived
--
they
arrived
at
the
figure
of
six
months
because
they
collated
the
experiences
that
had
been
offered
to
them
by
the
judiciary.
in
the
petition
of
brooks,
the
court
felt
that
four
months
was
sufficient.
in
the
--
in
the
matter
of
ross
against
wallace
they
--
the
court
felt
that
four
to
six
months
was
a
sufficient
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
believe,
sir,
that
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
no,
sir.
i
would
not.
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
would
say,
sir,
that
one
day
of
imprisonment
or
detention
would
be
unconstitutional
and
wrong
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
could
be
established,
even
within
the
six
months
period
that
the
--
that
the
government
could
not
affect
the
deportation
of
--
of
the
particular
subject
non-citizen.
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
will
give
you
two
actual
cases.
they
are
cited
in
our
brief,
sir.
the
case
of
blankenstein
and
the
case
of
cushman,
i
believe
mr.
cushman
is
one
of
the
defendants.
we
went
into
court
--
we
went
into
court
and
we
demonstrated
that
in
the
case
of
mr.
cushman,
it
was
impossible
to
deport
mr.
cushman.
he
came
from
the
soviet
union.
the
soviet
union
said
that
they
would
not
accept
this
man,
that
this
man
had
expatriated
himself
years
ago.
the
same
was
true
with
blankenstein,
and
there
the
--
it
was
an
expression
of
the
--
of
the
district
court
that
where
--
where
you
actually
have
on
your
hand
an
inviable
power
to
deport
or
the
power
to
deport
has
become
inviable.
holding
the
man
in
--
imprisonment
or
otherwise
restricting
him
becomes
a
deprivation
of
this
man's
liberty.
ms.
blanch
freedman
oh,
no,
i
say
that
he
can
be
deported.
at
anytime
he
can
be
deported,
sir,
at
anytime
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
--
that
you
can
get
a
country
to
take
him
or
he
can
get
a
country.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
the
government
has
the
power
of
asking
and
demanding
the
subject
non-citizen
to
surrender
for
deportation.
ms.
blanch
freedman
when
the
time
comes,
sir.
when
the
time
comes
the
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
--
i
submit,
sir
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
--
that
if
--
it
probably
--
i
imagine
the
logical
conclusion
of
the
position
does
come
down
to
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
position
has
a
rationale
to
it.
your
honor,
estimates
that
imprisonment
during
this
period
is
too
harsh.
ms.
blanch
freedman
now,
the
difference
between
imprisonment
and
restrictions
on
liberty
both
violate
the
--
the
constitutional
mandate
that
an
individual
shall
be
free.
this
court
itself
has
said
in
bolling
against
sharpe
and
in
williams
against
spears,
that
liberty
is
not
only
--
does
not
only
mean
restricted
freedom
and
kept
imprisonment,
liberty
extends
to
locomotion
to
other
aspects
of
living.
ms.
blanch
freedman
but
that
man
had
a
trial.
that
man
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
no,
sir.
we're
not
contesting
deportability.
what
we
are
contesting
is
what
they
are
doing,
what
they
are
doing
with
the
power
to
deport.
the
--
the
liberties
that
are
being
taken
--
that
are
being
taken
away
from
the
appellants
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
--
under
the
theory
of
deportation.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that's
correct.
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
position.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
the
position.
that
is
the
position
because
the
things
you
thereafter
do
to
the
--
to
the
non-citizen
of
outright
deprivations
of
liberty
without
due
process,
without
the
indicia
of
those
judicial
legal
procedures
that
all
individuals
are
entitled
to.
ms.
blanch
freedman
if
your
honor
please.
in
the
case
of
wong
wing
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
held
very
clearly
that
the
order
of
--
that
an
order
of
deportation
cannot
be
used
to
inflict
punishment.
ms.
blanch
freedman
right.
you
can
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
or
now
here,
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
here
what
you
have
--
there
you
had
deportation
stayed
while
they
imprison
--
while
they
imprisoned
the
non-citizen.
in
the
situation
before
you,
you
also
had
deportation
stay.you
had
deportation
stay
perhaps
for
a
lifetime
of
these
individuals.
and
we
say
in
the
same
way
that
in
the
--
in
the
wong
wing
case
that
you
could
not
inflict
punishment,
you
cannot
inflict
this
kind
of
punishment
upon
--
upon
these
aliens.
that
they
are
--
once
you
had
a
--
the
power
to
deport
becomes
inviable,
becomes
impossible
of
--
of
effectuation.
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
would
doubt
it
very
much
sir.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that's
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
well,
that's
precisely
what
i
say
they
can't
do.
that's
why
we're
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes.
there
i
say
that
power
--
the
power
to
know
where
he
is,
the
power
to
know
where
he
is,
so
that
they
can
effect
deportation.
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
have
not
denied
to
the
government.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
--
that
power
--
that
power
we
are
not
contesting.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
power
is
contained
in
another
provision
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
law
that
they
--
and
they
have
that
--
they
have
that
information.
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
--
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
i
will
concede
its
constitutionality.
ms.
blanch
freedman
it
may
well
be.
yes,
sir.
ms.
blanch
freedman
subsection
(d).
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
think
it
does
sir,
because
i
think
what
they
are
doing
--
what
they
are
doing
in
--
under
that
section.
what
that
section
authorizes
congress
--
what
congress
has
authorized
the
attorney
general
to
do
in
that
section
has
--
has
violated
the
rights
of
the
freedom
and
the
liberties
of
these
individuals.
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
believe,
sir,
it
is
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
to
me,
it
appears
that
the
question
of
imprisonment
maybe
one
--
maybe
one
--
one
of
degree.
if
you
can
say
to
an
individual
that
you
may
not
move
beyond
an
area
of
50
miles,
you
can
say
to
him,
you
may
not
move
beyond
an
area
of
5
miles,
3
miles,
2
miles
beyond
your
back
door.
you
can
effect
even
a
house
arrest.
ms.
blanch
freedman
it
may
--
it
may
follow
if
that
is
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
but
here
--
but
this
is
a
broad
power.
the
fact
is
that
the
government
claims.
the
government
claims
that
under
this
--
under
this
section
they
have
the
power
to
deport.
they
have
the
right
and
they
so
say
on
page
48
of
their
brief,
the
power
to
hold
in
custody
once
you
have
a
deportable
alien.
and
if
--
if
the
government
can
regulate,
supervise,
and
restrict
the
motion
and
the
activities,
and
the
movements,
and
say
with
whom
an
individual
may
associate,
then
they
--
they
very
well
may
be
able
to
hold
in
custody
for
the
rest
of
they
--
of
their
of
natural
lives,
these
individuals
whom
cannot
--
who
cannot
be
deported.
ms.
blanch
freedman
i
submit,
sir,
that
the
imposition
upon
these
individuals
that
they
might
not
associate
with
anyone
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
--
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
isn't
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
they
would
preclude
them
from
associating
with
members
of
their
own
families
if
--
if
their
association
in
anyway
furthered
communist
doctrine.
and
that
is
the
--
that
is
in
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
supervisory
orders
that
have
been
imposed
upon
--
upon
the
appellant.
ms.
blanch
freedman
no,
there
have
not
been
administrative
instructions
as
to
these
cases
or
as
to
any
other
case
that
i
know.
ms.
blanch
freedman
on
pages
6
and
7
of
the
brief,
particularly
on
page
7.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
originally,
the
order
was
that
the
alien
shall
not
associate
with
anyone.
the
question
of
a
--
as
--
the
question
of
not
associating
with
a
spouse
was
a
further
modification
that
was
made
subsequently
by
the
immigration
service,
so
that
as
the
provision
reads
on
page
7,
the
original
provision,
it
doesn't
even
excuse
association
with
a--
with
a
spouse
or
member.
ms.
blanch
freedman
it
wasn't
--
it
was
amended
subsequent
to
the
institution
of
the
suit.
ms.
blanch
freedman
no.
it
was
--
because
it
was
amended
subsequent
to
the
filing
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
in
the
government's
brief
either.
ms.
blanch
freedman
yes,
sir.
we
conceive
of
this
as
punishment
that
is
being
inflicted
upon
these
individuals.
it
works
upon
them
in
an
order
at
hardship.
a
man
who
has
to
report
every
week
to
the
immigration
service
is
in
a
position
where
--
and
we
have
alleged
it
in
our
papers.he
loses
not
only
his
way
--
the
day's
wages
but
not
in
frequently
he
loses
his
job.
ms.

freedman
and
is
on
parole
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
category
--
that
is
the
position
that
these
individual
appellants
find
themselves
in.
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
and
--
and
a
probation
order
ends
within
a
specified
period
of
time
and
the
individual
goes
back
--
goes
back
into
--
into
society,
goes
back
into
life
that
he
has,
and
he
is
a
part
of
the
general
--
of
the
general
community.
now
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct.
a
probation
prisoner
does
report,
but
these
people
are
not
at
least,
theoretically,
not
supposed
to
have
been
convicted
of
any
crime.
these
individuals
are
deportation
for
whatever
hardship
maybe
involved
in
it,
has
been
--
it
has
been
reiterated
over
and
over
again
is
just
a
civil
matter,
even
though
its
consequences
may
be
as
grave.
ms.
blanch
freedman
and
that
is
--
ms.
blanch
freedman
that
is
correct,
but
its
effects
upon
the
treatment.
what
happens
to
these
people
puts
them
in
the
category
of
an
individual
on
--
on
probation.
i
--
i
submit
to
this
court
the
cases
and
the
thinking
that
has
been
expressed
by
the
judiciary,
it's
true
lower
court,
over
the
years
where
they
have
pointed
out
that
the
power
to
deport
does
not
carry
with
it
anything
more
than
just
the
power
to
expel
from
the
--
from
the
land
the
individuals
that
have
been
deemed
undesirable.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
when
you
take
into
account
the
terrific
broadness
of
the
power
to
deport,
that
--
that
the
categories
who
can
be
made
deportable
can
be
--
can
be
declared
deportable
for
reason
or
no
reason.
and
then
you
couple
with
it
a
power
to
permit
the
immigration
service,
or
the
attorney
general,
or
anybody
to
be
able
to
control
the
lives
of
these
individuals
when
they
are
unable
to
actually
effect
the
deportation,
you
have
developed
a
very
awesome
and
fearsome
power
in
the
hands
of
a
few
individuals.
