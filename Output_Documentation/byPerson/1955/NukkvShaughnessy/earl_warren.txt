ms.

you
may
proceed.

chief

mr.
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
(inaudible),
i
suppose
that
these
words
on
page
13,
“or
to
furnish
such
information
as
may
be
deemed
fit
and
proper,”
will
encompass
everything
that
is
intended
under
subdivision
3,
where
it
says
to
give
information
under
oath
as
to
his
nationality,
circumstances,
habits,
associations,
and
activities,
and
such
other
information
whether
or
not
related
to
the
forgoing
as
the
attorney
general
may
deem
fit
and
proper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
(inaudible),
in
order
to
determine
the
scope
of
these
regulations,
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
ask
you
this
question
referring
to
subdivision
3,
"to
give
information
under
oath
as
to
his
nationality,
circumstances,
habits,
associations,
activities
and
such
other
information,
whether
or
not
related
to
foregoing,
as
the
attorney
general
may
deem
fit
and
proper."
under
your
concept
of
the
--
of
the
case,
would
the
petitioner
have
the
right
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
think
he
has
a
right
there
and
--
and
if
he
does
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
cannot
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
cannot
--
he
cannot
be
prosecuted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
assume
it
was
proper
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
over
--
a
little
further
in
that
same
--
in
that
same
section
that
says,
"any
alien
who
shall
willfully
fail
to
comply
with
such
regulations,
or
willfully
fail
to
appear,
or
to
give
information
or
--
going
on
to
the
other
places,
“shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony
and
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$1000
or
shall
be
imprisoned.”
now,
does
not
the
--
the
section
say
that
he
--
if
he
--
if
he
fails
to
give
the
information
as
required
in
this
section
3
that
he
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
it
would
be
--
it
would
valueless,
wouldn't
it?
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
that
the
administrative
interpretation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr
--
mr.
(inaudible),
on
this
--
on
this
question
of
giving
information
under
oath,
suppose
that
the
--
one
of
the
petitioners
here
was
--
were
--
was
asked
certain
questions
that
the
attorney
general
thought
were
not
the
proper
subject
of
a
claim
with
the
fifth
amendment
and
he
immediately
went
into
court
or
grand
jury
and
sought
the
indictment
of
--
of
these
people.
what
administrative
relief
would
they
have
and
how
could
they
--
how
could
they
protect
themselves
against
prosecution
at
that
time
before
they
had
a
review?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they
were
convicted
perhaps.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
language
is
openly
broad.
in
this
--
in
this
section,
you
couldn't
make
it
much
broader.
it
says
if
he
doesn't
give
that
information
under
oath,
he
is
subject
to
a
punishment
for
felony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
once
a
year.
that's
a
long
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
would
he
just
have
to
wait
until
--
until
he
was
tried
and
convicted
and
then
come
up
through
the
courts
on
--
on
that
before
he
could
test
out
the
constitutionality
of
this
provision
even
though
there's
been
an
order
against
him
for
the
years
perhaps?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
no.
no,
it
didn't
say
appropriate.
as
i
read
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
she
is
to
give
information
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
the
attorney
general
may
deem
fit
and
proper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
looking
at
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
in
the
order
the
attorney
general
means
as
he
deemed
fit
and
proper
also,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
