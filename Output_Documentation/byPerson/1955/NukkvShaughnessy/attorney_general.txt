attorney
general
may
it
--
may
it
please
the
court.
the
--
on
page
13
and
14
of
the
record,
clause
5
(b),
the
bottom
two
lines
at
the
bottom
of
page
13
and
at
the
top
of
page
14
is
that
provision.
the
provision
quoted
in
appellants'
brief
was
the
provision
which
was
applicable
to
the
appellants
gannet,
bittleman
and
jones,
which
was
issued
in
1953.
the
smith
act
defendants,
which
did
not
have
these
modification,
the
subsequent
orders,
the
orders
applicable
to
the
appellant
nukk
and
the
others
here,
the
other
11.
most
of
them
have
that
proviso,
all
the
orders
that
were
issued
after
19
--
after
january
1st,
1954
have
this
proviso.
it's
available
to
the
others
on
application.
the
policy
is
to
allow
this
proviso,
which
covers
associations
with
the
family,
not
just
the
spouse
with
the
alien's
family
and
with
counsel.
mr.
attorney
general
it
certainly
applies
to
most
of
them.
the
record
as
printed
includes
only
this
one
order
of
supervision.
each
order
of
supervision
is
a
next
--
is
part
of
the
record
that
was
set
up
to
this
court.
the
orders
are
substantially
identical.
i
have
checked
myself,
eight
or
ten
of
them,
and
as
i
remember
the
order
--
that
proviso
was
an
almost
that
were
issued
after
the
1st
of
january
1954.
it
may
not
have
been
in
one
or
two
of
the
earlier
orders
--
mr.
attorney
general
there
is
no
reason
that
i
can
see.
i
think
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
didn't
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe,
your
honor,
there
are
one
or
two
exceptions.
mr.
attorney
general
i
assume
that
on
application
that
standard
policy
now,
which
--
available
to
these
people
if
they
want
their
order
modified
in
this
way.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
think
they
should.
unfortunately,
i'm
not
the
administrator
of
this
statute.
mr.
attorney
general
they
--
the
absence
of
the
provision
would
trouble
me
very
much.
mr.
attorney
general
there's
something
--
mr.
attorney
general
general
swing.
mr.
attorney
general
general
swing,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
commission
of
immigration.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
you
have
to
take
into
account
everything
that's
in
the
record.
that
some
of
these
orders
contained
that
provision
and
some
of
them
do
not.
perhaps
i
can
best
again
--
mr.
attorney
general
it's
--
it's
--
i
believe
that
one
or
two
of
these
orders
are
in
the
form
of
the
three
orders
that
were
applicable
to
the
appellants
gannet,
bittleman,
and
jones.
that
is
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
i
certainly
will,
your
honor.
the
real
problem
here
and
the
knob
of
this
case
can
be
very
simply
stated.
appellants
are
aliens
who
have
been
actually
ordered
deported
on
account
of
membership
in
a
subversive
organization,
the
communist
party.
now,
the
basic
question
is
whether
these
aliens
have
a
constitutional
right
to
be
free
from
all
supervision,
no
matter
how
reasonable
it
is,
pending
their
ultimate
deportation
once
six
months
have
passed
without
deportation
being
effect.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
the
hardcore
problem
which
is
presented
by
this
case.
there's
another
basic
issue
on
the
merits,
which
we
cannot
ignore,
whether
such
aliens
have
a
constitutional
right
to
continue
their
subversive
associations
and
activities,
pending
ultimate
deportation.
as
i
understand
the
appellant's
argument,
they
have
a
right
to
continue
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
to
continue
communist
activities
and
associations.
however,
before
reaching
these
basic
constitutional
issues,
we
have
to
consider
a
threshold
issue
of
jurisdiction
--
of
justiciability,
whether
a
case
or
controversy
appropriate
for
judicial
determination
has
been
alleged
by
these
14
appellants
or
rather
these
11
appellants
as
to
whom
the
order
is
currently
applicable.
it
is
to
that
threshold
problem
which
the
first
part
of
my
argument
will
be
directed,
whether
these
broad
issues
on
the
merits
are
properly
before
the
court,
depends
on
the
solution
of
the
threshold
issues.
as
ms.
agrin
pointed
out,
the
court
below
did
not
reach
the
merits.
it
assumed
that
no
justiciable
case
or
controversy
had
been
alleged.
now,
this
is
a
case
where
they
challenge
statue
and
the
administrative
rulings
issued
under
it,
have
we
concede
some
degree
of
present
impact
on
this
litigants?
the
other
hand,
the
impact
is
hard
to
pin
down.
it
is
partially
in
the
present,
it
appears
to
be
substantially
in
the
future.
and
the
real
question
is
where
to
draw
the
line,
as
regards
to
the
degree
of
present
impact,
which
it
is
--
which
is
necessary
to
have
in
order
to
make
a
matter
justiciable.
now,
we
have
real
trouble
with
one
facet
of
this
case.
as
we
concede
in
our
brief,
the
arguments
are
very
close
on
justiciability.
we
have
made
an
advocate's
presentation
of
those
matters.
we
feel
we're
obligated
to
the
court
to
do
so
under
its
prior
decisions.
but
we
don't
feel
that
there's
only
one
answer
that
reasonable
lawyers
or
reasonable
judges
could
arrive
as
to
certain
facets
of
justiciability
in
this
case.
as
to
other
facets
of
the
case,
we
feel
very
strongly
that
too
broad
on
attack
has
been
attempted
and
that
there
are
some
matters
certainly
which
are
clearly
beyond
the
scope
of
what
a
court
can
properly
consider
at
this
time.
now,
the
difficulty
here
with
the
justiciability
issues
arises
because
there
is
a
tremendous
variation
in
the
relative
degree
of
rightness
for
judicial
review
of
the
individual
substantive
issues.
for
instance,
the
requirement
relating
to
medical
and
psychiatric
examinations
to
which
reference
has
been
made.
the
order
merely
states
that
you
may
be
called
upon
to
submit
to
such
examination
if
necessary,
the
statute
said.
there's
no
allegation
that
any
of
these
appellants
have
been
asked
to
submit
to
such
an
examination.
if
there
is
any
substantial
constitutional
question
that
arises
in
connection
with
such
medical
examination.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any,
but
if
there
is,
the
appropriate
time
to
consider
it
is
when
the
issue
is
--
has
a
direct
eminence
rather
than
a
mere
future
impact.
mr.
attorney
general
we
would
not
be
adverse
to
having
a
decision
from
this
court
on
that
constitutional
issue
if
we
are
entitled
to
it.
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
think
the
answer
is
quite
that
easy,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
and
it's
tied
up
with
the
scope
of
permissible
review
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
presents
the
--
which
presents
the
problem.
the
nature
of
this
statute
providing
for
supervision,
congress
hasn't
fixed
hard
and
fast
rules.
if
congress
recognizes
there's
got
to
be
some
variation
in
case
to
case,
discretion
is
lodged
in
the
attorney
general
to
mold
a
supervision
order
which
meets
the
particular
case.
now,
once
an
alien
becomes
subject
to
supervision,
that
is
when
six
months
have
elapsed
after
the
deportation
order
has
become
final,
an
order
is
served
on
these
aliens
which
in
part
is
a
printed
form.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
record
where
the
order
is
set
forth
on
pages
12,
13,
and
14,
the
sections
on
13,
numbered
1,
2,
3
(a),
3
(b),
and
4.
they
are
all
part
of
a
printed
form,
as
is
the
material
that
appears
on
page
12
with
respect
to
the
communist
association
provisions,
items
5
(a),
(b)
and
(c)
and
the
travel
limitation
on
page
14
item
6,
those
as
the
record
which
is
before
the
court
shows,
have
been
typewritten
(inaudible)
that
is
a
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
take
it
that
that
is
the
requirement
of
the
order
which
keys
to
that
portion
of
the
statute.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
--
i
think
that
all,
your
honor.
of
course
there
are
some
blanks
in
that
printed
form
as
to
how
frequently
reporting
should
take
place,
or
when,
or
whether
should
be
in
person
or
in
writing.
but
in
substance,
the
first
part
of
the
order
is
pretty
much
of
a
standard
form
and
yet
modifications
can
be
made
on
application.
now,
there
is
no
provision.
there
is
no
regulation
then
promulgated
providing
for
application.
the
administration,
as
we
understand,
has
been
relatively
flexible.
the
--
if
an
alien
wishes
guidance
as
to
a
provision
or
he
calls
to
the
attention
of
the
district
director,
certain
provision
that
has
unusual
impact,
a
change
may
be
made.
that
is
up
to
the
district
director
if
he
has
some
question
about
it,
he
will
refer
to
higher
headquarters
for
advice
as
to
whether
this
provision
should
be
appropriate
in
this
kind
of
case
or
not.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
--
i
would
be
very
surprised
if
--
when
that
provision
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
district
director,
it
would
not
be
modified
in
that
way.
i
believe
these
modifications
which
have
come
in
have
frequently
been
due
to
specific
circumstances
being
called
to
their
attention..
for
instance
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
--
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
it
--
our
position
essentially
is
this,
that
if
there
is
some
matter
which
arises,
which
is
peculiar
to
the
facts
of
some
individual
alien,
that
he
should
first
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
administrative
officials.
if
he
does
not
get
relief,
having
called
that
to
the
attention
of
the
administrative
officials,
as
far
as
we
can
see,
he
has
a
--
an
appealable
case
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
but
does
he
have
an
appealable
case
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
where
he
runs
to
the
court
immediately
or
whether
--
mr.
attorney
general
there's
--
there's
absolutely
no
administrative
procedure
which
--
which
i
know
of
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
which
has
been
formalized
--
which
has
been
formalized
in
regulations.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
--
it's
a
matter
--
it's
really
a
matter
of
good
practice.
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
required
by
the
statute
but
i
think
i
can
illustrate
it
this
way.
if
the
appellant
sought
administrative
clarification
of
ambiguities,
and
if
they
called
attention
to
all
individual
hardships,
and
if
they
raised
the
questions
of
any
possible
lack
of
administrative
authority,
whether
some
of
these
provisions
are
too
--
too
broad
as
a
matter
of
delegation
or
a
matter
of
authority
under
the
statute,
then
the
issues
would
very
likely
be
reduced
in
scope.
they'd
be
clarified
and
they'd
be
shuttled,
and
then
we'd
have
to
concede,
we
recognize
a
right
to
review
under
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
attorney
general
(inaudible)except
in
the
few
cases
which
are
so
remote
that
it
falls
beyond
the
constitutional
concept
to
case
in
controversy.
we
believe
they
are
not
elements
of
present
controversy,
present,
so
that
the
constitutional
limitation
is
met
as
to
the
hardcore
issues,
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
would
welcome
a
--
an
adjudication
on
that
issue
of
the
right
to
supervise.
if
this
court
fails
that
the
matter
is
sufficiently
clear
and
the
facts
is
sufficiently
definite
to
justify
that
adjudication,
we
don't
stand
very
strongly.
on
that
point,
we
feel
we're
obligated
to
present
it
to
the
court
in
view
of
the
court's
past
decisions.
mr.
attorney
general
if
somebody
had
a
legitimate
reason
such
as
regular
past
employment
in
the
100-mile
radius.
mr.
attorney
general
if
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
if
such
a
constitutional
right
exist
which
we
do
not
--
cannot
see
that
it
does
exist
with
this
class
of
people.
maybe
there
is
a
--
certainly,
i
would
think
there
was
a
present
controversy
in
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
decision
on
the
merits
might
never
be
reached
though
if
the
administrator
on
considering
the
facts.
mr.
attorney
general
we'll
give
you
100
miles
but
then
if
you
say,
"well,
i
want
a
101,"
or
"if
you
give
me
200,
i
want
to
201."
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that
is
the
claim
which
these
appellants
make.
mr.
attorney
general
and
the
--
this
order
has
denied
them.
that
privilege,
it
has
denied
them.
another
privilege
they
claim,
the
privilege
not
to
report.
they
claimed
they've
got
no
right
to
report.
they
claim
they
have
--
or
they
have
a
right
not
to
report.
they
claim
they
have
a
right
not
to
notify
changes
of
address
within
48
hours.
unless
the
court
has
some
further
questions
on
justiciability,
i'm
prepared
to
turn
to
the
merits.
mr.
attorney
general
that
would
be
a
possible
solution.
our
view
is
that
the
justiciable
issues
are
--
those
issues
which
clarification
will
--
administrative
clarification
will
add
relatively
little
to,
those
are
the
justiciable
issues
and
those
we
believe
are
so
insubstantial
that
this
court
may
affirm
the
judgment
below
without
sending
them
back.
as
to
the
issue
of
the
communist
association
and
activity
clause,
that
we
believe
requires
further
administrative
clarification
and
we
will
not
concede
that
that
--
the
propriety
of
that
clause
is
really
justiciable
unless
this
court
goes
further
than
we
understand
their
prior
decisions
have
gone
because
we
haven't
got
the
thing.
the
individual
factual
situation
hasn't
been
developed
before
the
administrator.
it
hasn't
been
taken
under
consideration.
mr.
attorney
general
he
most
certainly
should.
mr.
attorney
general
we
--
we
concede
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
we
concede
that
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
see
how
he
could
possibly
be
prosecuted
for
claiming
a
fifth
amendment
right
if
it
was
properly
invoked.
if
it
was
invoked
in
a
frivolous
fashion
or
as
to
something
which
the
courts
--
mr.
attorney
general
but
assume
--
assume
there
was
--
it
was
properly
invoked,
he
most
certainly
would
have
it.
mr.
attorney
general
it
--
it
so
states
and
the
section
does
not
specifically
write
in
a
--
any
reference
to
the
fifth
amendment
or
any
other
constitutional
privileges
which
may
be
--
which
may
exist.
but
we
believe
that
you
have
to
interpret
this
statute,
this
section
in
the
light
of
the
whole
statute
and
in
the
light
of
the
constitution.
and
we
make
no
contention
whatsoever
that
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
validly
invoked
would
not
be
a
protection
here
to
any
prosecution
under
the
statute.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
that's
right.
you
--
the
congress
cannot
abolish
the
fifth
amendment
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
--
if
this
was
either
administered
that
way
or
intended
that
way
and
there's
nothing
in
the
congressional
reports
that
suggest
any
intent
to
limit
the
fifth
amendment,
or
for
that
matter
other
constitutional
provisions.
the
statute
came
into
the
law
in
the
--
in
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
and
section
1
(b)
of
that
act
specifically
states,
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
be
construed
in
anyway
to
limit
or
infringe
upon
freedom
of
speech
as
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
united
states
and
no
regulation
shall
be
promulgated
hereon
to
having
that
effect.”
so
i
understand
that
was
put
in
as
an
excess
of
caution,
but
with
response
of
the
act
staying,
of
course
that
was
intended
and
if
you
want
the
clarified
why,
go
ahead
and
put
that
in.
it
was
--
it
wasn't
in
the
act
that
originally
grafted.and
i
read
this
provision
in
the
light
of
the
constitutional
protections,
which
are
well
recognized.
mr.
attorney
general
i
--
no
--
of
no
administrative
interpretation.none
is
alleged
in
this
--
in
any
of
the
complaints
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
if
invoked,
would
not
be
respected,
if
properly
invoked.
mr.
attorney
general
there's
no
administrative
--
there
is
no
specifically
--
mr.
attorney
general
no.
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
is
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
in
a
--
in
this
complaint
--
in
these
complaints,
the
appellants
had
alleged.
we
have
applied
for
the
following
relief
from
this
order
to
the
appellee
and
he
has
rejected
our
application,
then
we
would
say,
as
to
those
matters,
there
is
a
right
to
review
under
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
it's
the
absence
of
that
allegation,
which
we
believe
makes
these
--
these
complaints
fatally
defective
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
where
it
is
so
apparent
from
the
kind
of
order
we
have
and
from
this
record,
which
shows
actual
modifications
of
the
50-mile
limit
and
of
the
requirement
report
in
person
as
to
one
of
the
appellants
who
called
the
attention
of
the
district
director,
an
illness,
and
requested
permission
to
remain
away
from
--
stay
at
a
health
resort
and
not
to
report
in
person.
the
order
was
promulgated
so
as
to
give
those
particular
modifications.if
those
modifications
have
been
denied,
then
that
would
have
been
a
very
serious
question,
which
as
far
as
i
can
see
would
be
reviewable
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
attorney
general
as
to
--
as
to
any
matter,
as
to
which
specific
facts
are
alleged
which
might
justify
some
change.
and
one
application,
one
denial,
i
would
think
that
the
order
would
be
subject
to
review,
whether
the
entire
order
can
be
reviewed
in
the
absence
of
any
application
to
the
administrators.
that
is
where
--
what
we
believe
would
cause
the
issues
to
be
too
--
too
many,
too
difficult,
unsubstantial,
and
bring
up
a
lot
of
matters
which
would
not
come
up
before
the
court.
and
as
we
understand
the
--
this
courts
holdings
on
justiciability,
if
the
administrative
process
can
eliminate
matters,
the
administrator
--
those
matters
should
go
to
the
administrative
process
first.
mr.
attorney
general
of
course
if
there
was
a
violation
of
the
order
at
a
prosecution
for
violation
under
the
sanction
provision
of
the
statute,
then
--
mr.
attorney
general
willful
and
knowing
violations.
on
page
5
of
the
government's
brief,
the
statute
is
set
forth
and
in
the
last
8
or
10
lines,
the
penal
sanction
of
the
statute
are
--
are
set
forth.
the
offense,
willful
and
knowing
violations,
give
rise
to
a
maximum
penalty
of
a
fine
of
$1000
or
imprisonment
not
more
than
one
year.
however,
as
we
interpret
this,
they
have
a
right
to
review
these
orders
without
violating
the
statute.
if
they
do
not
seek
review
without
violating
the
statute,
then
some
of
these
issues
would
be
properly
justiciable
on
the
violation
without
question.
mr.
attorney
general
i
didn't
catch
your
--
the
entire
question.
mr.
attorney
general
if
--
if
they
--
there
is
no
administrative
review
other
than
at
the
hands
of
the
district
director
and
he
can
pass
the
thing
along
to
his
superiors
in
cases
of
noble
issues.
mr.
attorney
general
then
they
can
seek
review
in
the
court
under
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
we
say
they
have
right
to
review
these
orders
when
the
administrative
process
has
come
to
rest
and
we
say
at
this
stage,
the
administrative
process
isn't
completely
at
rest.
mr.
attorney
general
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
they
--
they
--
some
arguments
are
made
in
these
individual
supporting
affidavits.
each
one
of
which
is
made
a
part
of
the
printed
record,
showing
individual
hardships,
alleging
individual
hardships
applicable
to
individual
appellants.
some
of
those
hardships
almost
certainly
would
give
rise
--
would
be
proper
grounds
for
modification
of
the
blanket
order,
which
was
initially
issued
ex
parte.
mr.
attorney
general
our
position
essentially
is
if
there
are
special
problems,
which
relate
to
your
case,
don't
run
to
the
court
first
with
them,
take
him
to
the
administrator.
if
the
administrator
will
grant
you
relief,
there
may
never
be
any
need
for
court
relief.
mr.
attorney
general
there
--
there
have
been
no
formalized
regulations
to
that
effect.
however,
the
changes
in
these
orders
have
in
fact
been
made
as
it's
shown
in
the
record.
and
they
are
somewhat
plastic.
it's
unlike
a
statute
which
says,
"this
is
it."
mr.
attorney
general
as
far
--
as
far
as
any
constitutional
limits
go,
i
absolutely
agree
with
your
honor.
whether
it
is
the
most
efficient
way
to
utilize
the
judicial
process
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
what
is
debatable
in
this
case.
mr.
attorney
general
when
i
said
--
used
the
term
courts,
i
wasn't
referring
merely
to
this
court
but
to
the
entire
court
system.
mr.
attorney
general
as
we
understand
it,
congress
has
allocated
certain
functions
to
administrative
officials
and
certain
functions
to
the
courts.
and
in
general,
the
--
the
whole
rule
of
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
which
arose
long
before
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
was
a
recognition
that
the
administrative
process
should
come
to
rest
before
the
courts
should
step
in.
it's
--
it's
a
close
question
on
the
facts
--
mr.
attorney
general
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
they
--
mr.
attorney
general
once
--
once
they
refuse,
whether
the
--
the
refusal
is
based
solely
on
grounds
of
conscience
and
they
are
prosecuted
and
in
confinement
then
habeas
corpus
would
be
available.
short
of
that,
we're
not
faced
with
a
tough
alternative
of
the
hatch
act
case,
mitchell
against
the
public
workers,
where
the
government
employees
were
faced
with
a
tough
alternative
of
--
you
give
up
your
claimed
rights
or
you
lose
your
job.
here,
we
think
there's
a
middle
ground
that
they
have
a
right
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
test
this
plastic
order
once
it
has
achieved
sufficient
solidarity,
whether
when
this
additional
administrative
remedy
available,
this
court
wants
--
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
willing
to.
mr.
attorney
general
if
your
honors
will
narrow
the
issue
--
will
narrow
the
issue
to
the
right
as
--
as
i
initially
stated
the
problem
to
the
right
to
be
free
from
all
supervision,
the
right
to
be
absolutely
free
in
connection
with
communist
activities
and
association,
then
i
think
on
those
narrow
issues,
there
may
be
a
justiciable
case
of
controversy.
when
it
comes
to
any
special
individual
details,
then
i
think
it
should
go
back
to
the
administrator.
mr.
attorney
general
if
it
is
possible
to
clean
the
case
up,
but
at
that
point,
it
would
have
to
--
and
you
have
to
have
hearings
on
the
merits.you
have
to
have
--
the
government
would
have
to
answer.
some
of
these
allegations
maybe
true,
some
of
them
maybe
improper.you'd
have
a
complicated
procedure
and
what
we're
suggesting
here
is
to
try
to
break
this
thing
down
so
as
for
the
purpose
of
clarifying
the
issues.
mr.
attorney
general
absolutely
impossible.
some
of
those
claims
maybe
true,
some
of
them
maybe
not.
that
would
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
unquestionably.
they
have
to
go
back
if
this
court
says
these
matters
should
be
tried
out
in
the
district
court
without
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
process.
if
the
court
will
accept
our
other
argument,
then
maybe
this
complaint
--
this
--
the
judgment
below
can
be
affirmed
on
the
hardcore
constitutional
issue
that
there
is
a
right
to
supervise,
and
the
right
to
supervise
does
extend
to
a
reasonable
prohibitions
against
continuation
of
communist
activities
and
associations.
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that
is
--
i
take
it
the
steps
--
if
the
court
--
yes,
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
turning
to
--
mr.
attorney
general
since
the
statute
has
been
--
mr.
attorney
general
my
own
view
is
perhaps
more
liberal
than
the
view
of
the
court
on
some
of
these
matters
of
justiciability
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
past.
i
find
no
constitutional
objection
to
passing
on
many
features
of
the
issues
which
are
raised
here
and
i
think
our
brief
is
--
is
directed
in
that
--
in
that
fashion.
but
i
have
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
anything
else
is
properly
justiciable
at
this
stage
other
than
these
hardcore
issues,
which
i
have
referred
to
in
the
argument,
which
are
referred
to
in
point
1
(c)
of
our
brief,
pages
32
to
39.
turning
to
the
merits,
our
problem
is
essentially
this,
whether
a
statute
--
whether
this
statute,
this
particular
statute,
directing
supervision
is
constitutional
as
a
whole
and
as
to
each
of
its
four
basic
directive.
the
four
basic
directives,
i
think,
your
honors,
are
now
familiar
with,
the
statute
set
forth
in
page
5
of
the
government's
brief,
the
directive
to
appear
periodically
for
identification,
to
submit
to
medical
examinations
if
necessary,
to
provide
information
when
requested,
and
to
conform
to
reasonable
written
restrictions
on
conduct
and
activities.
we
have
another
issue
on
the
merits,
whether
the
statute
has
been
properly
construed
and
applied
by
those
administering
it.
it
is
possible
that
the
statute
on
its
phase
may
be
constitutional
and
yet
that
some
provision
of
the
order
may
exceed
the
authority
which
the
statute
give.
we
do
not
in
anyway
concede
that
any
portion
of
this
order
is
--
goes
beyond
the
authority
delegated
by
the
statute.
however,
it
is
a
possibility
which
your
honors
should
consider.
now,
on
--
perhaps
the
best
way
to
deal
with
this
matter
on
the
merits
and
a
great
many
possible
objections
have
been
raised
in
the
brief,
is
to
consider
that
statute
and
the
--
each
section
of
the
order.
at
this
point,
i
am
assuming
virtually
complete
justiciability
for
purposes
of
this
portion
of
the
argument.
the
statute
is
set
forth
on
page
5
of
our
brief.
the
sample
order
is
set
forth
on
pages
13
--
12,
13,
and
14
of
the
record.
if
your
honors
care
to
follow
with
the
two
provisions,
i
will
go
down
step-by-step.
the
statute
requires
that
appellants
in
this
--
or
the
aliens
in
this
particular
category,
against
whom
a
final
order
of
deportation
is
outstanding
should
appear
from
time
to
time
for
identification
before
an
officer
of
the
immigration
service.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
--
mr.
attorney
general
they
--
if
you
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
page
13
of
the
record,
the
--
in
section
4
--
under
section
4,
that's
two-thirds
the
way
down.
there
is
a
form
--
and
this
comes
from
the
printed
form
statement
as
to
when
a
--
a
written
report
is
made.
what
the
administrative
officials
ask
--
ask
for
in
an
administrative
report,
the
name,
the
alien
registration
number,
the
date,
his
current
address,
and
his
place
of
employment.
now,
that's
perhaps
a
little
more
--
more
than
just
identification
but
i
take
it,
they
have
to
disclose
their
--
they
have
to
report,
check
in,
show
their
alien
identification
card.
i
wouldn't
have
any
--
the
record
doesn't
show
what
more
would
be
meant
than
that.
the
actual
order
as
modified
in
this
case,
as
originally
issued,
weekly
reporting
was
required.
while
this
litigation
was
pending,
the
policy
changed.
this
plastic
order
was
revised
to
substitute
monthly
reporting.
so
our
test
is,
is
it
unreasonable?is
it
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
single
out
aliens
in
this
particular
class
and
say,
"once
a
month,
you
shall
appear
before
an
immigration
officer
for
identification.”
now,
congress
hasn't
specified
that
it
would
be
a
month
later,
they
merely
said
time
to
time
and
left
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
administrative
official.
has
there
been
any
abuse
of
discretions
in
fixing
a
monthly
period?
we
state
that
--
we
submit
that
this
--
that
that
issue
cannot
be
seriously
argued
that
there's
anything
unconstitutionally
wrong,
any
improper
clarification
in
that
specific
provision
of
the
statute.
and
if
we
are
permitted
to
have
it,
we
would
appreciate
a
ruling
on
constitutionality
from
this
court,
which
would
settle
a
lot
of
doubts
and
litigation
on
that
particular
point.
we
feel
so
unsubstantial
that
such
a
ruling
is
proper
even
in
the
state
of
this
record.
the
second
requirement
of
the
statute,
to
submit
if
necessary
to
medical
and
psychiatric
examination
at
government
expense,
and
in
the
order
that
is
the
provision
that's
filed
in
section
2
of
the
sample
order,
page
13,
that
the
alien
shall
--
shall
upon
request
produce
himself
at
a
time
and
place
designated
for
the
purpose
of
submitting
to
medical
psychiatric
examinations.
the
purpose
of
those
examinations
is
brought
out
in
the
briefs.
the
charge
of
course
was
made
in
some
of
the
supporting
affidavits,
that
these
examinations
would
have
been
used
as
a
--
to
brainwash
aliens
with
unpopular
views
and
to
harass
them.
there's
no
allegation
that
a
single
one
of
these
aliens
has
been
asked
to
submit
to
such
an
examination.
the
record
shows
that
they
are
used
to
get
information
required
by
foreign
countries
as
to
the
state
of
the
health
of
the
person
for
whom
travel
documents
are
asked.
they
have
also
used
in
case
somebody
claims
inability
to
perform
a
--
one
of
these
requirements
of
the
order
on
grounds
of
health.
perfectly
reasonable
provisions,
we
submit,
we
can't
see
any
substantial
constitutional
issue
as
to
those
matters.
free
to
give
information
under
oath
as
to
nationality,
circumstances,
habits,
associations,
activities,
and
such
other
information,
not
--
whether
or
not
related
to
the
foregoing
as
the
attorney
general
may
deem
fit
and
proper.
and
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
the
provision
in
the
order
with
respect
to
that
is
merely
to
furnish
such
information
as
may
be
deemed
fit
and
proper.
now,
as
to
that
provision,
certainly
some
of
this
information
is
obviously
needed
under
--
for
the
purposes
of
implementing
the
deportation
statute.
some
of
the
information
may
be
needed
to
prevent
continuation
of
the
type
of
undesirable
activity
which
was
a
basis
for
deportation,
subject
always
to
the
right
of
the
alien
to
claim
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
there
are
possible
questions,
which
may
arise
as
to
the
application
of
that
statute.
we
concede
that.
we
do
not
believe
in
the
absence
of
specific
allegations
as
to
specific
questions
that
have
been
asked
that
there's
any
matter
that's
appropriate
for
a
decision
at
this
particular
point.
the
only
questions
as
to
which
any
specification
is
made
are
stated
in
identical
terms
or
virtually
identical
terms
in
the
supporting
affidavits,
we've
set
them
forth
at
page
13
of
our
brief,
and
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
questions
which
any
of
them
alleged
have
been
asked.
they
expressed
their
fear.
they
state
this
--
this
order
is
broad
enough.
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
permit
them
to
be
asked
what
i
ate
for
breakfast,
whether
i
had
an
argument
with
my
wife,
what
friends
i
had
dinner
with,
where
i
went
on
saturday
night,
what
i
think
of
the
situation
in
indochina.
questions
like
that.
there's
no
justiciable
controversy
unless
these
people
will
allege
specific
questions
that
they're
asked,
we
submit.
they
do
allege
in
the
supporting
affidavits
that
they
have
been
submitted
to
sweeping
interrogation.
each
one
in
identical
terms
or
virtually
an
example
is

21
of
the
record,

lines
down
when
--
there
is
an
allegation,
i
am
subjected
to
sweeping
into
interrogations
as
to
my
associations
and
activities.
is
that
enough
to
--
not
in
the
complaint,
in
a
supporting
affidavit
without
a
single
allegation
as
to
what
the
question
was.
they
show
they
know
how
to
frame
specific
questions
because
four
or
five
lines
down,
they
say
he
got
a
right
to
ask
or
he
could
ask
what
i
ate
for
breakfast.
we
say
more
than
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
state
a
justiciable
controversy
even
under
the
liberal
rules
of
federal
pleading.
we
think
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
they
are
virtually
entirely
repetitive,
except
for
an
occasional
paragraph
which
states
a
specific
individual's
work
problem.
but
otherwise,
they
are
very
substantially
repetitive,
paragraph
by
paragraph.
mr.
attorney
general
some
question
of
--
mr.
attorney
general
they
--
this
court,
as
i
read
its
decisions,
has
been
split
on
the
question
of
when
a
statute
is
so
vague
as
to
be
unconstitutional.
the
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
companion
--
of
a
companion
section
was
before
the
court
--
this
court
in
carlson
against
landon.
and
i
--
i
think
they
have,
aside
this
case,
was
the
one
that
dealt
more
with
the
question
of
vagueness,
but
question
is
how
much
do
you
have
to
spell
out
in
a
statute
in
order
to
permit
--
in
order
to
have
it
meet
constitutional
standards?
and
we
submit
here
that
where
you
have
provision
for
administrative
ordinance,
which
once
the
administrative
process
has
been
exhausted,
open
the
door
to
judicial
review
without
the
danger
of
violating
the
statute
to
test
its
scope.
that
this
is
a
permissible
--
this
is
efficiently
definite
when
read
in
the
light
of
the
objectives
of
the
deportation
statute.
if
it
goes
outside
those
objectives,
presumably,
that
will
be
an
unlawful
attempt
to
exercise
power.
mr.
attorney
general
when
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
finally,
and
this
is
probably
the
most
controversial
section
of
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
the
--
the
protection
would
have
to
be
the
protection
which
the
courts
would
accord
to
the
fifth
amendment
after
they
were
--
after
they
were
invited.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
court
presumably,
if
the
legal
question
was
raised,
it
could
be
raised
and
tested
on
motion
before
conviction.
it
--
it
might
be
possible.
it
might
not.
mr.
attorney
general
the
--
as
originally
enacted,
the
statute
did
provide
for
a
felony
punishment,
but
the
statute
has
been
amended
to
eliminate
felony.
that
--
that
not
only
changes
a
thing
in
degree,
it
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
--
it's
a
long
time,
your
honor.
mr.
attorney
general
this
--
of
course
the
order
states
and
provides
such
information
as
may
be
appropriate
and
--
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
sure,
your
honor,
is
correct
on
that.
mr.
attorney
general
that
may
be
deemed
fit
and
proper.
as
may
be
deemed
fit
and
proper.
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
our
confusion
is
to
claim
the
statute
and
the
order.
i
was
looking
at
the
order
and
your
honor
was
looking
at
the
statute.
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct
and
at
a
lower
administrative
level,
we
will
concede.
mr.
attorney
general
the
attorney
general
himself
would
only
pass
on
these
questions
in
a
--
in
an
unusual
situation.
mr.
attorney
general
the
record
doesn't
show
and
i
don't
know
but
i'm
in
a
position
to
--
to
answer
that
question.
however,
i've
seen
questions
get
to
the
attorney
general
pretty
quickly
when
the
occasion
warranted.
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
that's
right.
the
--
i'm
familiar
with
the
case,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
familiar
with
--
at
this
time
with
the
details
of
the
--
of
the
statute.
although,
that
was
a
--
a
unanimous
decision,
i'm
not
sure
in
our
good
standing
it
is
now,
i
just
don't
know.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
mr.
attorney
general
it
may
be
--
it
may
be
in
good
standing
and
these
problems
of
vagueness,
if
one
takes
them
in
the
abstract,
the
difficult
way,
you
have
a
policy
spelled
out
in
these
deportation
statutes.
i
believe
an
opinion
of
mr.
justice
reed
pointed
out,
that
will
give
the
framework
which
will
permit
the
administrative
discretion
to
be
exercised
properly
without
filing
the
constitution.
mr.
attorney
general
to
private
individuals
rather
than
persons
who
were
acting
under
the
direct
authorization
of
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
the
--
that's
the
fourth
point.
i
believe
at
this
point,
i've
pretty
well
exhausted
the
third
and
the
fourth
is
the
requirement
that
the
alien
be
made
to
conform
to
such
reasonable
written
restrictions
on
his
conduct
and
activities
as
prescribed
by
the
attorney
general
in
his
case.
now,
that
is
fairly
broad
and
yet
when
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
--
of
the
statute,
the
purposes
of
supervision
and
read
that
provision
with
those
purposes
in
mind,
we
believe
that
it
is
sufficiently
definite
to
meet
the
constitutional
test.
after
all,
what
are
the
purposes
of
supervision?
they're
implementing
the
deportation
statute,
keeping
track
of
the
alien,
getting
information,
trying
to
make
it
more
difficult
to
prevent
the
alien
from
fading
into
the
population
as
we
have
seen
some
of
the
defendants
in
the
dennis
case
do
very
successfully,
too
successfully
in
fact.
and
the
other
purpose
of
preventing
the
continuation
of
the
type
of
undesirable
activity
which
was
the
basis
for
deportation,
and
that
brings
me
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question.
here,
the
deportation
was
bottomed
on
membership
in
the
communist
party.
the
only
sanction
against
an
alien
being
a
member
in
the
communist
party
was
the
--
well,
there
are
two
sanctions,
there's
the
smith
act
for
a
certain
type
of
activity
and
the
sanction
of
being
deportable.
the
sanction
of
deportation,
the
deterrence
which
may
be
implicit
and
that
are
gone
now.
the
threat
of
deportation
is
gone.
they
faced
the
worst
and
the
government
is
powerless
to
carry
the
thing
out.
now,
is
congress
free
to
--
is
congress
to
have
their
hands
tied
and
say,
"if
you
can't
find
some
foreign
country
to
take
these
deportable
aliens,
if
you're
going
to
have
them
in
your
midst,
then
you
cannot
limit
the
kind
of
activity
which
resulted
in
their
being
undesirable
citizens.”
now,
that's
what
the
administrators
obviously
driving
at.
we
believe
it's
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
it's
very
difficult
to
graft
a
proper
provision,
that's
the
kind
of
provision
which
we
would
like
to
have
any
individual
problems,
call
to
the
attention
of
the
administrators.
any
of
these
people
who
are
deprived
from
seeing
their
family
or
associating
with
their
family.
we
are
sure
that
that
would
be
on
this
record,
it
has
been
taken
care
of
in
any
part
of
that
was
issued
after
a
certain
date,
presumably
after
the
point
it
was
raised.
now,
just
what
precise
limits
should
be
put
on
that
association,
that
is
something
we
believe
it
has
be
worked
out
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
it's
too
broad
to
litigate
at
this
time
in
advance
of
specific
applications.
