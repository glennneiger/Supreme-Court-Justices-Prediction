justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim,
mrs.
freedman,
that
no
supervision
on
any
kind
is
permissible?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
i
make
my
question
a
little
more
acquainted
to
you?
these
people
having
been
deported
in
their
presence
in
this
country
being
only
because
of
the
--
in
authority
to
deport
at
the
moment
let
us
say
or
for
an
indefinite
time,
you
claim
that
the
government
cannot
supervise
even
to
the
extent
of
ensuring
their
presence
so
that
they
will
be
available
for
deportation
when
up
to
the
--
it
presents
itself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
supervision
at
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
what
--
as
i
read
your
brief,
it
seem
to
me
that
in
polite
language,
you
really
had
said
that
there
was
a
judiciable
controversy
here
so
far
as
the
question
of
whether
any
supervision
or
is
permissible
is
concerned.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
in
the
plain
--
prior
to
that
language,
you
don't
really
say
that
this
isn't
justiciable
to
that
extent,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
what
stage
under
that
--
at
what
stage
under
that
procedure
would
the
order
ever
become
justiciable?
