where
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
where
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not
have
that
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
the
exact
(voice
overlap)
in
the
government
brief,
do
you
know
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
some
of
them
contain
the
provision
barring
them
from
associating
with
anybody
even
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
thought
you
said
they
might
seek
review?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
these
are
orders,
doesn't
it?
and
they
--
they
might
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i
didn't
understand
what
you
meant
by
when
the
order
comes
to
rest
but
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
after
it's
issued
and
is
there
hanging
over
as
a
threat?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
any
order
that
provides
that
shall
be
the
way
they
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
assume
that
something
like
justice
frankfurter
has
said
originally
here
that
if
you
have
an
order
that
tells
the
man
where
he
can
go,
and
what
he
must
do,
and
where
he
cannot
go,
and
he's
hanging
over
it
and
as
a
--
generally,
has
supported
family
which
purports
to
be
under
an
act
of
congress
and
so
forth,
then
as
a
justiciable
controversy
even
though
--
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
wise
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that,
i
see.
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
it
not
be
then
that
that
is
a
case,
a
justiciable
controversy
which
should
be
sent
back
to
the
court
for
it
to
pass
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
meant
by
identification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that
one.
i'm
just
curious.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
might
be
some
questions
of
vagueness
with
reference
to
that
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
vagueness
with
reference
to
the
statute
which
gives
the
attorney
general
the
right
to
ask
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
allegation,
how
many
times
removed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
--
this
is
at
least
as
vague
isn't
it
not
as
the
--
what
the
court
held
unconstitutional
under
(inaudible)
case,
the
nra.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
--
i
haven't
seen
it's
repudiated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
since
i've
been
on
the
court.
