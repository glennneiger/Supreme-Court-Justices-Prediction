mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
expatriation
case
and
by
that
statement
it
is
also
a
hard
case
because
if
the
judgment
of
the
courts
below
was
sustained
as
we
think
it
ought
to
be,
this
young
man,
who
is
a
determined
young
man
and
who
wishes
very
much
to
come
to
the
united
states
and
take
his
place
as
a
citizen
will
not
be
able
to
do
so.
but
we
stand
here
to
support
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
because
we
think
that
this
young
man
at
a
time
when
the
choice
was
his,
made
a
choice
which
congress
within
it's
discretion
and
permissibly
under
the
constitution,
has
decided
shall
expatriate
him,
shall
cause
him
to
lose
his
nationality
and
shall
require
him
to
remain
abroad.
perhaps,
the
sum
of
the
government's
case,
which
i
shall
try
to
explicate
some
length,
is
found
in
the
words
of
judge
harrison
at
the
end
of
his
oral
opinion.
he
said,
“this
plaintiff
is
an
intelligent
young
man
and
he
probably
would
have
made
a
good
soldier
or
--
and
a
good
citizen.
but
he
decided
not
to
be
a
good
soldier
and
therefore
he
cannot
be
a
good
citizen.”
in
other
words,
when
the
choice
was
his,
he
made
one
which
congress
has
decided
shall
bar
him
now
from
citizenship.
the
case
involved
section
401
(j)
of
the
1940
nationality
act.
but
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
comparable
provision,
somewhat
stricter
in
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act
and
so
it
has
continuing
importance
in
--
in
that
respect.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
intend
to
discuss
that
in
some
detail,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
agree
with
mr.
wirin
that
there
three
issues
here.
one,
the
issue
with,
did
this
petitioner
in
fact
remain
in
mexico
in
order
to
avoid
service
in
the
united
states
army?
and
two,
does
the
section
as
matter
of
statutory
construction
cover
the
situation
of
this
petitioner?
i
should
like
to
say
at
this
point
that
the
arguments
that
mr.
wirin
made,
to
which
i
shall
try
to
answer
about
the
--
the
executive
agreement
and
the
words
of
the
statute
have
not
here
before
been
raised
in
this
case
until
the
brief
on
the
merits.
they
were
not
mentioned
in
the
court
below
in
either
court
or
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
that
has
bearing.
i
don't
want
to
stand
too
much
on
this
because
this
is
a
constitutional
case
and
the
court
has
recently
taught
us
that
in
constitutional
cases,
even
issues
which
have
not
been
raised
may
be
rest
upon.
but
it
does
have
a
bearing
because
the
fact
that
the
--
these
issues
were
not
raised
at
all
below,
it
didn't
cause
the
facts
to
be
developed.
and
mr.
wirin
has
made
certain
assumptions
which
i
believe
contrary
--
it'd
be
contrary
to
the
fact
and
was
not
supported
by
the
record
and
would
not,
i
believe,
be
supported
if
the
case
had
been
tried
on
that
theory.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
made
an
election?
i
--
i
don't
believe
i
said
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
--
i
believe
we
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
i
mean,
he
made
the
choice
not
to
serve
in
the
united
states
army,
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
to
register
and
not
to
serve.
that
--
that's
what
i
meant.
well,
getting
to
the
first
point
or
the
third
point,
of
course,
is
the
constitutionally
of
the
statute.
getting
to
the
first
point,
did
petitioner
remain
abroad
in
order
to
evade
training
and
service
under
the
statute?
we
agree,
of
course,
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
government
to
prove
expatriation.
petitioner
satisfied
his
burden
of
proving
his
citizenship
when
he
proved
that
he
was
born
in
new
mexico
in
1924.
so,
we
agree
that
the
government
did
have
the
burden
of
proving
losses
of
nationality
or
expatriation.
we
also
agree
that
that
burden
is
not
the
mere
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
burden.
that
it
is
the
same
burden
which
the
court
for
the
--
is
as
set
forth
in
the
denaturalization
cases,
the
schneiderman
case,
the
baumgartner
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case.
there's
been
some
discussions
by
some
text
writers
and
others
that
that
higher
standard
had
fought
in
those
cases
should
apply
only
to
denaturalization
because
you're
taking
away
--
you're
taking
away
a
right
given
by
a
--
by
a
court
decree
and
that
in
expatriation
which
doesn't
depend
upon
a
citizenship
given
by
a
court
decree,
you
needn't
have
such
a
high
standard.
but
the
government
had
not
taken
that
position
throughout
these
expatriation
cases
in
the
lower
courts.
and
we
do
not
take
it
here.
we
think
we
have
to
prove
that
he
expatriated
himself
by
unequivocable
--
unequivocal,
clear
convincing
evidence
as
the
court
said
in
those
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
am
not
certain
what
position
the
united
states
attorney
did
take
below
because
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
colloquy
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
at
pages
20
and
21?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
20
is
the
sentence
which
mr.
wirin
did
not
read
from
the
united
states
attorney's
remark.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
at
the
bottom,
the
very
bottom
of
page
20
is
a
sentence
which
mr.
wirin
did
not
read
from
the
united
states
attorney's
remark
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
that
sentence
there
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
burden
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
is
upon
the
government
to
respond
to
any
defense
they
have
to
make.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
has
that
burden,
the
burden
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
plaintiff
has
that
burden,
the
burden
is
on
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
his
right
--
i
--
i
think
we
must
continue,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
--
and
i
think
the
issue
here
isn't
so
much
what
position
the
united
states
or
for
what
position
judge
harrison
took.
and
i
think
that
is
absolutely
clear.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
meant
as
a
general
rule.
i
--
we
--
we,
of
course,
not
know
what
he
--
a
particular
individual
of
the
united
states
attorney
in
a
particular
case.
but
if
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
general
powers.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
perhaps
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
don't
--
i
think
this
is
a
--
an
unclear
statement
of
the
--
of
what
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
said,
because
he
did
say
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
to
respond
to
any
defense
they
have
to
make.
and
then
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
means
that
the
united
states
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
expatriated
himself.
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
the
burden
is
established
as
soon
as
he
established
that
he
--
he
is
a
citizen.
and
then,
if
the
court
desires
to
have
this
proven,
his
admissions
and
so
forth.
and
then,
may
i
also
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
what
judge
harrison
said
a
little
later
on.
he
says,
"haven't
you
to
burden
--
haven't
you
the
burden
to
prove
that
he
lost
his
citizenship?”
and
i
think
that
is
the
view
that
judge
harrison
took
of
this
proceeding.
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
read
it
that
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
read
it
at
meaning
that
mr.
grean
thinks,
and
we
would
agree,
that
the
government
sustains
its
burden
when
it
brings
in
the
record
of
the
three
prior
hearings
which
he
did
have
before
the
immigration
service
and
which
are
contained
in
exhibit
a
in
--
in
the
record
which
isn't
lodged
with
the
clerk,
as
mr.
wirin
said.
my
understanding
is,
that
mr.
grean
was
taking
the
position
that
when
--
when
he,
on
behalf
of
the
government,
brought
in
those
admissions,
he
had
sustained
the
government's
burden.
and
then
they
went
on
to
discuss
whether
uncorroborated
admissions
would
be
sufficient.
that
that
is
the
way
i
read
the
record.
but
in
any
case
as
i
make,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
i
think,
it's
clear
that
judge
harrison
took
the
position
that
the
burden
was
on
the
government.
that
he
thought
it
had
been
sustained
here.
for
instance,
if
you
read
the
colloquy
of
the
court,
the
statement
of
the
court,
the
oral
statement
of
the
court
from
page
32
to
34,
it's
clear
that
he
says,
“i
don't
believe
the
petitioner
when
he
testified
that
he
hadn't
evaded
the
draft
in
this
court.
i
believe
that
he
was
stating
the
truth
when
he
testified
before
the
immigration
service.”
and
then
a
the
very
end
of
page
33,
judge
harrison
says,
"i
don't
know
how
you
can
ask
counsel.
ask
me
to
find
for
the
plaintiff
here,
in
view
of
his
admissions
and
statements
before
the
immigration
officer.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
true.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
(voice
overlap)
--
if
you
read
it
all
together,
if
you
read
what
judge
harrison
said
from
the
very
beginning,
to
the
very
end,
i
think
all
his
meaning
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
and
that
he,
judge
harrison
came
to
--
had
the
firm
conviction
based
on
what
he
thought
was
convincing,
clear,
unequivocal
evidence
that
the
plaintiff
was
not
telling
the
truth
when
he
testified
before
him
but
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
spoke
before
the
immigration
authorities.
that
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that's
a
summary
statement
of
meaning
that
he
is
entitled
--
that
--
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
judgment
in
the
case.
i
think
that's
just
the
way
it
--
it
a
--
a
man
would
say,
i
think
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
judgment.
and
if
you
read
it
in
connection
with
this
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it's
the
repetition.
i
think
what
he
is
saying
above
is
--
is
along
the
same
lines.
and
if
you
read
in
connection
with
the
specific
statements
that
he
makes
about
what
he
believes
and
what
he
disbelieves
on
what
he
believe
has
been
proved.
our
view
is
that
he
--
that
judge
harrison
accepted
the
view
that
the
burden
was
on
the
government
to
prove
expatriation.
and
as
i
say,
that
is
the
burden
we
accept
in
this
court.
it's
not
been
fulfilled.
we
have
not
met
our
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
was
taken
when
he
was
an
infant
of
less
than
two
in
about
1925
or
1926.
he
was
born
in
1924.
and
he
stayed
in
mexico
until
he
returned
to
this
country
in
april
1946.
he
never
returned
to
the
united
states
at
all.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
when
it
was
claimed?
well,
he
--
the
claim
wasn't
made
until
he
tried
--
until
about
1947.
he'd
been
there
from
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
at
--
he
was
required
to
register
under
the
president's
proclamation
in
december
1943
because
he
was
18
by
that
time.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
that
he
remained
abroad.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
remained
abroad.
and
as
i
will
try
to
point
out,
we
believe
that
the
record
is
clear.
one,
that
he
knew
that
there
was
a
war
on.
he
knew
that
he
had
to
register
and
he
did
not
register.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
that
--
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
will
try
to
expatiate
with
the
length
of
time
i
have,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
the
only
--
the
only
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
--
are
the
statements
were
made
by
him
before
the
immigration
authority
which
are
contained
in
--
in
exhibit
a,
plus
the
evidence
which
is
in
--
in
the
record
which
was
only
his
--
his
testimony.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
plus
what
corroboration
there
was
in
the
unadmitted
facts
such
as
the
fact
that
he
did
stay
abroad,
he
came
to
the
united
states
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
he
stayed
abroad
until
he
was
21
and
a
half.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
plus
other
admitted
facts
which
i
would
like
to
go
into.
but
before
i
do
that,
i
think
i'd
like
mention
the
fact
that
a
good
part
of
this
case
depends
upon
the
kind
of
person
petitioner
was.
and,
of
course,
the
district
judge
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
him.
and
his
statements,
we
think,
are
--
are
very
significant.
he
said,
"this
man
was
an
intelligent
man."
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
intelligent
boy,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
he
was
not
a
peon
by
any
means.
that
he
was
far
above
the
ordinary
intelligence
of
many
of
his
people.
that
he
was
a
pretty
bright
young
fellow.
and
with
due
deference
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
reading
of
his
statements
before
the
immigration
authorities
would
support
that
--
that
view.
"he
seems
from
these
statements,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
not
translated
accurately.
incidentally,
he
was
not
illiterate.
he
is
literate
in
spanish
at
the
time
not
--
not
in
english.
he
was
not
illiterate
at
all.
he
seems
to
be
astute
and
quick,
and
determined,
and
proud.
he
--
this
record
does
not
reveal
a
man
who
was
cowed
by
the
immigration
authorities,
quite
the
contrary.
it
reveals
a
man
who
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
--
to
citizenship.
first,
he
said,
"well,
i've
--
i've
made
a
mistake.
i
should
have
registered.
let
me
in
and
i'll
pay
whatever
penalty
there
was."
there
was
a
man
who
was
a
man,
who
i
think,
was
so
proud
that
he
didn't
want
to
admit
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
draft.
he
said
it
was
his
mother
who
was
afraid
of
the
draft,
as
i
will
point
out
in
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
it
was
quite
--
quite
possibly
true
but
originally
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
true.
we
think
it's
not
an
excuse.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
incidentally,
in
the
discussion
of
the
--
of
the
burden
of
proof,
there
was
one
thing
i
should
have
mentioned
but
didn't.
and
that
is
the
question
of
duress.
and
now,
i
--
i
said
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
committed
an
act
of
expatriation.
that
he
remained
abroad
for
this
purpose.
the
issue
then
arises,
can
he
excuse
this
act
of
expatriation
on
the
ground
of
duress,
as
many
people
who
voted
abroad
or
served
in
the
italian
army
tried
excuses
and
have
successfully
excused
and
on
the
ground
that
they
were
under
duress.
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
mean
that
is
one
of
the
questions.
i'm
--
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
say
that
on
that
issue,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
government
does
not
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
acted
voluntarily.
it
may
very
well
be
and
--
and
there
seems
to
be
a
conflict
of
circuits
at
least.
the
second
circuit
seems
to
have
held
quite
clearly
that
the
burden
of
proving
duress
was
on
the
--
is
on
the
plaintiff's,
not
on
the
united
states.
but
once
the
united
states
has
shown
that
he
committed
an
act,
the
burden
of
proving
duress
is
on
the
--
on
the
plaintiff,
the
person
who
claims
that
he
did
not
expatriate.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
right
mr.
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
that
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
and
this
seems
an
opportune
time
to
purpose
what
i'm
about
to
say
about
the
record
by
saying
that
this
case
was
before
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
three
times.
and
each
time
they
upheld
either
the
exclusion
or
the
deportation.
and
that
is
the
same
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
in
many
--
has
many
--
had
many
other
cases
of
this
kind
and
has
in
those
cases
frequently
held
that
there
was
no
expatriation
because
other
young
men
did
stay
in
mexico,
not
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft
but
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
their
family.
in
this
case,
and
on
the
basis
of
the
information
which
i'm
about
to
detail
to
the
court,
the
board
held,
and
we
think
quite
properly
that
this
man
did
stay
in
mexico
for
that
purpose.
and
not
solely
to
support
his
family
or
to
be
with
them
or
for
some
other
reason
which
would
not
expatriate
him.
now,
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
--
the
facts
in
the
record?
and
by
the
record
i
mean
this
printed
record
plus
the
exhibit
which
is
lodged
with
the
clerk.
and
i
think
what
i'm
about
to
say
must
always
be
--
must
be
heard
against
the
background
of
the
type
of
person
a
petitioner
was,
the
way
judge
harrison
described
him
and
as
i
think
his
characteristics
appear
from
these
--
these
hearings.
he
knew
he
was
an
american
citizen
from
the
time
he
was
12
or
13.
that
is
undisputed.
he
knew
he
was
an
american
citizen
and
born
in
this
country.
it's
also
undisputed
that
he
wanted
to
come
to
this
country
from
the
time
he
was
13
or
14
because
he
was
ambitious.
and
he
felt
that
there
were
schools
in
this
country
which
could
supply
him
with
mechanical
training
which
is
what
he
wanted
to
get.
and
he
could,
probably,
couldn't
get
in
mexico.
so
that
he
did
want
to
come
to
this
country.
and
there
are
admissions
that
he
wanted
to
come
to
this
country
not
only
when
he
was
--
before
the
war
but
even
from
1942
on.
but
that
he
wouldn't
come
because
his
mother
didn't
want
him
to.
he
knew,
and
i
--
on
--
on
the
basis
of
these
admissions
that
the
united
states
was
at
war
at
least
from
1942.
he
knew
that,
too.
he
knew
that
he
was
required
to
register
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
in
the
--
in
this
exhibit.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
it's
not.
it's
in
the
--
it's
not
in
the
--
in
the
--
he
didn't
in
the
--
at
the
trial
before
judge
harrison,
he
denied
he
knew
the
united
states
was
at
war.
he
said
only
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
knew
that
he
was
required
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
is
filled
--
the
--
the
record
is
filled
with
that.
in
fact
some
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
he
did.
in
fact,
some
of
the
quotations
which
mr.
wirin
has
included
in
his
reply
brief,
stated.
i
don't
have
them
handy
now,
but
they
stated,
i
knew.
for
instance
on
page
16
of
mr.
wirin's
reply
brief,
fourth
line,
“i
told
him
the
truth
that
i
knew
all
about
it
and
i
didn't
do
it."
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
about
requiring
to
register.
the
time
is
--
is
short
and
i
can't
detail
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
(voice
overlap).
but
i
will
--
i
will
cite
categorically
that
there
are
statements
in
this
exhibit
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
for
instance
on
the
--
on
page
7
of
the
government's
brief,
not
of
mr.
wirin's
brief,
the
government's
brief,
“that
the
only
true
thing
is
and
the
only
one
that
i
give
now
is
my
mother's
fear
of
military
service
for
me.
i
could
have
registered
for
it
in
chihuahua,
mexico.”
chihuahua
was
the
capital
of
the
state
and
he
--
he
went
there
several
times.
"i
could
have.
i
went
there
two
or
three
times,
the
capital
of
the
state.
it
was
because
of
--
of
the
fear
of
my
mother
that
i
did
not
do
so
before
1946."
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
my
view
of
the
facts,
it
does
get
down
to
that
--
that
one
point.
that
there
isn't
any
doubt
that
he
knew.
he
also
said
he
knew
hostilities
had
ceased
in
1945.
so,
i
don't
remember
when
it
was
but
i
knew
it
was
in
1945.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
this
was
not
before
judge
harrison.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
was
in
the
--
in
the
immigration
inquiry.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
he
denied
that.
but
i
--
most
of
the
statements
that
i'm
talking
about
were
made
at
one
of
the
three
hearings
that
he
held.
and
then
he
admitted
in
detail
and
not
simply
in
response
to
a
leading
question.
"did
you
stay
abroad
to
--
to
evade
the
draft?"
he
admitted
in
detail,
"yes,
i
knew
what
i
was
doing.
i
didn't
want
to."
let
me
read
to
the
court
just
the
very
first
one,
first
time
the
question
was
asked
him,
at
his
very
first
hearing.
"why
did
you
not
want
to
register
for
military
service
for
this
country
in
1944,
1945
or
1946?"
"because
i
was
afraid
to
register."
"why
were
you
afraid?"
"i
was
afraid
of
military
service
during
the
war."
then
a
little
while
later
they
asked
him
again
and
he
said,
"i
just
told
you.
well,
i
will
tell
you
again.”
“i
did
not
want
to
register."
"they
asked
him,
“why
did
you
not
register
at
the
american
consular
in
chihuahua,
near
your
home?"
"well,
i
will
tell
you
again.
i
did
not
want
to
register."
so,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
--
that
he
knew
of
the
requirement
because
he
was
--
he
--
chihuahua
was
a
leading
city
and
he
went
there.
and
as
i
think
he
was
a
--
a
relatively
intelligent
young
man.
we
also
think
it's
clear
from
his
own
statements
in
--
in
this
record
that
he
didn't
stay
abroad
for
the
reasons
which
did
occur
in
the
other
cases
in
which
mexican-americans
have
not
been
expatriated.
there
have
been
cases
where
these
--
where
the
boards
have
found
that
they
stayed
abroad
for
these
other
purposes
to
take
care
of
their
families
or
some
other
reason
like
that,
may
not
even
have
known
of
the
registration
requirement.
we
think
this
petitioner
is
in
an
entirely
different
category
and
--
and
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
it's
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
about
--
i'm
about
to
touch
on
that
subject.
and
it's
not
only,
if
i
may
point
out,
it's
not
only
an
admission
to
a
leading
question.
it
isn't
that.
"did
you
evade
the
draft?"
answer
-
"yes."
because
in
cases
like
that,
the
boards
have
held,
well
the
--
the
admissions
of
--
to
the
leading
--
the
admission
as
result
of
a
leading
question
was
overcome
by
the
other
statements.
these
are
detailed,
repeated
statements
again
and
again
and
again
that
he
knew
about
the
requirement
to
register
and
he
didn't
do
it
because
either
of
his
own
fear
or
--
or
his
mother's
fear
for
him.
now,
i
come
to
the
question
of
whether
these
--
these
admissions
can
be
considered.
i
think
there's
little
doubt
and
i
won't
spend
much
time
on
it,
that
they
can
be
considered
as
substantive
or
affirmative
evidence.
there
was
some
argument
made
below
that
they
should
only
be
considered
as
--
as
impeaching.
and
that
they
impeached
his
prior
testimony
but
then
the
government
was
left
with
nothing
at
all
and,
of
course,
had
not
sustained
his
burden.
the
universal
rule
is
that
they
are
admissible
as
--
as
affirmative
or
substantive
evidence.
and
that's
true
in
criminal
cases
as
well
as
civil
cases.
then,
the
question
arises
whether
corroboration
is
necessary.
and
on
that
we
--
we
take
the
position,
first,
that
corroboration
is
not
necessary.
and
second,
i
will
take
the
position
that
if
it
is
required,
it
--
it
--
there
is
corroboration
here.
on
--
corroboration
has
long
been
held
unnecessary
in
almost
every
civil
cases.
in
every
--
on
the
service
civil
case
there
are
a
few
exceptions,
mostly
historical
and
some
made
by
statute.
but
the
--
the
requirement
of
corroboration
has
been
limited
almost
entirely
to
criminal
cases.
now,
it
is
said
at
once,
that
expatriation
is
a
severe
penalty
or
--
or
severe
consequence
of
action.
and
if
the
corroboration
requirement
should
be
carried
over
to
that
type
of
proceeding
as
well
as
obtaining
only
criminal
cases.
and
to
that,
our
answer
would
be
that
the
court
had
not
done
so.
that
there
are
many
cases
in
which
the
alliance
is
really
twofold.
the
court
had
not
done
so.
and
second,
that
the
higher
standard,
the
clear
convincing,
unequivocal
standard
is
intended
to
attain
the
same
result
without
the
adoption
of
a
mechanical
rule
such
as
a
corroboration.
i
said
the
court
has
not
done
so.
denaturalization,
expatriation,
deportation
cases
have
been
before
this
court
many,
many
times
and
the
court
has
refused
to
carry
over
to
those
cases
the
--
the
various
rules
which
do
apply
in
--
in
criminal
cases.
the
rules
against
self-incrimination,
i
mean
the
court
has
held
that
inferences
can
be
made
from
the
silence
of
the
accused
if
he's
called
upon
to
testify.
chief
justice
stone
and
--
and
justice
brandeis
(inaudible)
case.
the
court
has
applied
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
--
in
denaturalization
cases.
there
has
been
no
tradition
of
carrying
over
into
this
field
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
congress
itself
has
adopted
--
has
put
into
the
statute
of
the
immigration
law,
provisions,
allowing
deportation
just
on
the
base
of
admissions
alone.
it's
long
been
the
rule
of
the
country
that
if
an
alien
admits
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
after
entry
or
before
entry,
he
is
--
he
is
deportable,
admits.
and
those
have
always
been
interpreted
as
--
as
had
been
applied
administratively
and
judicially
as
allowing
for
deportation
on
his
sole,
uncorroborated
admission.
and,
of
course,
in
immigration
cases,
generally,
both
expatriation
and
deportation.
there
have
used
--
admissions
have
been
used
and
corroboration
has
not
been
required.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
they
are
different.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
are
different
but
i
may
point
out,
mr.
justice,
that
deportation
of
an
alien
who
had
lived
in
this
country
50
years,
may
be
a
greater
sacrifice
than
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
expatriation
of
this
--
of
this
young
fellow
who
lived
in
the
country,
only
two
and
not
once
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
true.
but
insofar
as
the
--
insofar
as
the
claim
is
that
the
--
the
proceeding
is
a
severe
one,
you
can't
get
much
help
because
of
the
deportation
situation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
had.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
is
my
primary
position
but
i
go
on,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can't
answer
the
question
because
i
don't
--
i
--
i
think
it
was
deterrence.
part
of
the
purpose
was
deterrence.
and
if
you
mean
by
punishment
to
deter
him
and
other
people
and
that
is
one
of
the
elements
of
punishment,
i
would
agree.
i
think
it
has
a
dual
purpose.
i
think
at
one,
it
--
this
effort
was
to
deter
petitioner
here
and
others
from
trying
to
avoid
or
evade
the
draft.
i
also
think
that
the
purpose
was,
which
you
might
call
a
consequence.
that
is,
a
person
who
made
a
choice
not
to
serve
the
country
wasn't
a
worthy
citizen
and
--
and
shouldn't
be
accepted.
so,
i
think
it
had
a
dual
purpose.
perhaps,
many
criminals
statute
do,
too,
but
so
do
several
remedies
and,
of
course,
deportation
and
other
provisions
of
the
expatriation
law
born
of
the
same
category.
they
may
attempt
to
deter
certain
types
of
action,
but
they
also
impose
condition
subsequent
upon
the
commission
of
the
act,
if
you're
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country.
expatriation
law
wants
to
prevent
that
from
being
done
and,
of
course,
it
imposes
consequences.
but
getting
to
the
point
of
whether
there
was
corroboration.
now,
the
corroboration
that
we
allege,
it
all
consists
of
what
petitioner
himself
admitted
at
the
trial
before
judge
harrison
or
the
undisputed
facts.
he
admitted
that
he
had
resided
abroad
until
april
1946.
that
is,
nine
months
after
hostilities
ceased,
was
the
first
time
that
he
sought
entry
into
--
into
the
united
states.
he
admitted
this
before
judge
harrison.
it
was
clear
that
he
was
amenable
to
the
draft.
there
was
a
provision
requiring
americans
resident
in
mexico
to
register
at
the
consulates
or
the
embassies
near
them.
and
as
i
said,
he
--
he
admitted
before
the
immigration
authorities
that
he
knew
of
that
provision
but
at
least
he
was
subject
to
it.
there's
no
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
the
opper
and
smith
cases
last
year
in
--in
criminal
cases,
the
court
laid
down
the
rule
that
there
must
be
substantial
and
other
evidence
fortifying
restraint
on
it.
i'm
trying
to
argue
that
the
admissions
that
he
made
before
the
immigration
authorities
were
fortified,
one,
by
the
admitted
fact
that
he
didn't
return
to
this
country
until
after
hostilities
had
ceased,
when
he
was
21
and
a
half
years
of
age.
we
think
that's
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
was
easy
for
him
to
come
back.
he
wouldn't
be
subject
to
service
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
in
a
place
where
he
could
be
killed.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
then
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
punishment?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
perhaps
not
today.
perhaps
tomorrow,
i'll
talk
about
the
--
the
1865
statute
which
was
passed
at
the
end
of
the
civil
war
which
--
which
said
that
deserters
from
the
army
were
those
people
who
evaded
the
draft,
lost
their
right,
forfeited
their
right
of
citizenship.
and
that
was
clearly
intended
in
its
context
and
just
the
reading
of
it
allow
to
deter
people
from
evading
the
draft
or
from
deserting
the
army.
then
that's
one.
and
that
was
in
effect
throughout
--
through
the
rest
of
the
civil
war
just
a
few
months
that
were
left.
it
was,
in
effect,
throughout
world
war
ii
and
was
the
prototype
of
this
statute
which
was
enacted
in
1944.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
--
as
construed
both
by
congress,
i
think,
and
administratively,
it
took
away
their
nationality,
their
--
and
citizenship
as
a
whole.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
had
--
that
those
who
had
some
other
nationality
had
that
left.
the
others
were
stateless.
this
is
--
this
is
the
way
the
state
department
construed
it.and
this
is
the
way,
i
think,
congress
construed
it.
it
--
it
appeared
in
the
revised
statutes
of
1871
under
the
title,
citizenship.
it
appeared
immediately
before
the
section
on
expatriation,
the
general
section
which
says
that
all
americans
have
the
right
to
expatriate
themselves.
and
it
appeared
under
the
regular
heading
citizenship,
along
with
other
provisions
which
deal
only
with
citizenship
as
a
whole,
with
nationality.
that
is,
all
americans
born
in
this
country
are
citizens
with
provisions
of
that
type.
it
was
so
interpreted
by
the
--
by
the
state
department,
as
i
say
it,
administratively
for
at
least
over
50
years.
in
1906,
the
citizenship
board
was
established
at
the
request
of
congress
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
it
has
very
distinguished
membership.
james
brown
scott,
then
the
solicitor,
was
the
chairman
and
they
issued
a
very
voluminous
report
which
was
the
basis
for
the
1970
expatriation
act.
and
in
their
report,
they
say
--
they
cite
this
1865
statute
as
a
--
as
a
statute
involving
loss
of
nationality.
at
that
time
it
was
the
only
statutory
provision
for
loss
of
nationality
because
the
1970
statute
hadn't
yet
been
passed.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
the
same
statute
which
--
which
provided
the
loss
of
citizenship
also
made
it
a
crime
both
to
avoid
--
evade
the
draft
and
to
desert
the
army.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
it
were
--
if
we
were
put
only
in
terms
of
--
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
and
i
haven't
finished
arguing,
but
i
think
there
was
sufficient
corroborative
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
black,
i
can
say
quite
frankly
now
that
there
is
no
statement
before
judge
harrison
in
which
he
admitted
that
that
was
his
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
--
there
is
no
testimony
by
anyone
else.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
just
as
in
many
criminal
cases,
the
element
of
willfulness
or
the
intent
to
--
to
perjure
or
lie
is
a
crucial
part
but
corroboration
does
not
require
someone
coming
up
and
saying,
"the
man
told
me
--"
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice.
we
take
the
whole
complex
of
facts
which
--
which
--
to
which
he
admitted
in
--
in
before
judge
harrison
does
corroborate
that
admission,
that
he
knew
about
his
american
citizenship,
that
he
wanted
to
come
to
the
united
states
long
ago,
that
he
did
not
come
until
after
the
war
was
over,
did
not
come
until
after
the
war
was
over.
he
--
the
people
had
told
him
that
the
united
states
was
at
war.
before
judge
harrison,
he
said
he
didn't
learn
until
1946.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i'm
talking
about
admissions
that
he
made
before
at
the
trial,
not
admissions
before
the
immigration
authorities,
testimony
that
he
made
at
the
trial.
and
we
think
it's
fair
to
use
testimony
that
he
gave
at
the
trial
in
corroboration
of
his
statements
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
his
extra
judicial
statements.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
--
there
is
no
other
evidence.
i
mean
there
isn't
--
there
is
no
evidence
by
anyone
else.
so
that
if
we
cannot
find
it
in
what
he
said,
plus
the
objective
fact
that
he
--
he
was
amenable
to
the
draft,
he
didn't
come
back
until
1946,
april,
plus
the
fact
that
he
knew
he
was
an
american
citizen,
plus
the
fact
that
he
wanted
to
come
to
this
country.he
admitted
he
wanted
to
come
to
this
country
from
an
early
age.
if
there
is
not
corroboration
in
that,
then
we
do
not
have
corroboration.
but
it's
our
position
that
that
is
sufficient
corroboration.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is,
the
draft.
i
--
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
that
would
be
sufficient
corroboration
even
in
a
criminal
case
of
--
with
a
man
of
this
type,
with
a
man
who
is
as
astute
though
not
learned
as
--
as
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
don't
mean
to
--
to
erase
it
but
i
--
i
wasn't
impressed,
mr.
chief
justice,
by
reading
the
--
the
record
before
the
immigration
authorities.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
i
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
was
referring
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
perhaps
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
that
was
an
overstatement,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
withdraw
that
remarks.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
i
would
think
he
was
--
he
was
quick,
a
quick
young
man.
and
i
think
he
was
a
determined
young
man
and
a
proud
young
man.
and
that
bearing
in
mind
the
kind
of
young
man
he
was,
i
think
there
was
sufficient
corroboration
in
this
case.
he
was
the
head
of
his
family.
he
was
the
oldest
son
and
his
father
had
died
a
long
time
ago
and
though
that
did
impose
certain
obligations
upon
him,
it
also
gave
him
a
certain
standard.
and
we
think
all
those
must
be
borne
in
mind.
and
now,
in
a
minute
or
two
left
this
evening,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
a
parental
influence.
of
course,
we
think
that
--
that
congress
envisaged
that
a
boy
of
18
who
was
subject
to
the
draft
could
not
seek
excuse
from
it
on
the
ground
that
his
--
his
parents
didn't
want
him
to
serve.
the
--
it
wouldn't
excuse
a
criminal
violation
of
the
act,
that
is,
the
--
if
a
man
were
prosecuted
under
the
selective
service
statutes
for
a
violation
of
failure
to
register
or
--
or
evading
the
draft,
he
couldn't
excuse
that.
i
can
feel
quite
sure
by
saying
that
his
mother
or
his
father
didn't
want
him
to
and
were
afraid
that
he
might
be
killed
or
injured.
and
there
were,
of
course,
for
many
parents
who
had
probable
fears
for
their
children
and
understandably
so.
but
it
is
not
the
kind
of
--
of
influence
that
congress
recognized
in
the
criminal
statutes
or
we
think
should
be
recognized
in
the
expatriation
statutes.
it's
clear,
both
from
his
own
testimony
before
judge
harrison
and
from
--
and
judge
harrison's
findings
on
the
testimony
before
the
immigration
authorities
that
his
mother
didn't
physically
keep
him
in
the
house.
and
there
might
be
some
cases,
of
a
person
of
a
different
type
where
that
--
where
the
person
was
locked
in
the
house
or
kept
--
kept
in
the
house
in
some
way.
and
we
think
that
--
that's
clearly
not
true
here.
it
was
mostly
the
influence
his
mother
had
on
him.
she
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
i
said
that
mr.
justice,
i
didn't
mean
to.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
then
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
if
he
stayed
--
if
he
--
if
he
knowing
that
it
was
his
desire
to
evade
that
--
of
his
obligation
to
serve
in
the
army,
and
if
he
stayed
away
because
his
mother
didn't
want
him
to
serve
in
the
army,
i
think
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
only
thing
i
said
that
if
he
stayed
away
because
his
mother
wanted
him
to
stay
in
mexico
to
help
support
her
or
--
or
for
some
other
reason
like
that.
that
would
not
be
allowed.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
record
in
the
--
before
the
immigration
authorities
shows
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
what
it
says.
yes.i
--
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
may
it
please
the
court.
before
embarking
on
the
discussion
of
the
matter
which
was
being
considered
when
the
court
rolled
this
yesterday,
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
touch
upon
two
preliminary
matters.
the
first
is
it
relates
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
as
to
why
the
trial
judge
in
his
oral
statement
felt
that
he
was
troubled.
he
said
that
he
was
troubled
and
he
wished
a
review
of
one
of
these
cases
was
sought
in
the
court
of
appeals.
we
agree
with
mr.
wirin
that
the
reason
for
the
statement
by
the
trial
judge
was
that
he
was
uncertain
whether
statements,
admissions
made
in
administrative
hearings
could
be
the
basis
for
expatriation.
we
think
that
was
the
reason
why
judge
harrison
suggested
that
--
that
review
be
sought.
the
second
matter
that
i
failed
to
mention
yesterday
and
i
think
it
bears
upon
judge
harrison's
evaluation
and
--
and
characterization
of
the
personality
and
the
type
of
person
petitioner
was
is
that
the
trial
judge
pointed
out
that
he
had
had
another
simiar
case
involving
a
person
whom
he
thought
to
be
a
different
kind
of
young
man,
and
in
that
case,
he
felt
that
expatriation
had
not
been
proved.
he
differentiated
this
case
from
that
case
and
i
bring
it
forth
to
indicate
that
it
shows
a
degree
of
selectivity
and
a
special
consideration
given
to
this
particular
case
by
judge
harrison.
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
on
providing
for
a
review
and
findings
of
fact
provide
that
due
regard
shall
be
given
to
the
opportunity
of
the
trial
judge
to
observe
the
witnesses.
and
we
believe
that
that
is
a
factor
which
should
be
considered
in
this
type
of
case
as
well
as
on
others.
in
the
(inaudible)
denaturalization
case,
this
court,
in
upholding
the
denaturalization
of
(inaudible)
mentioned
the
fact
that
it
paid
due
regard
to
the
opportunity
of
the
trial
judge
to
weigh
the
credibility
and
characteristics
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice,
but
we
do
not.
as
i
explained
yesterday,
we
do
not
accept
from
the
standard
which
was
laid
down
in
the
baumgartner
and
schneiderman
cases
and
which
was
accepted
also
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
we
accept
the
standard
laid
down
in
those
cases.
we
believe
that
it
was
fulfilled
in
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
mr.
justice
burton,
i
think
he
did.
i
think
a
reading
of
the
closing
statement
at
the
end
of
the
case
plus
his
consideration
of
the
--
consideration
of
the
matter
of
the
admission
of
the
immigration
testimony
before
in
the
case
that
he
did.
at
the
close
of
--
of
his
opinion,
he
says
that
he
doesn't
believe
the
--
the
petitioner.
he
believes
that
the
petitioner
was
more
accurate
and
more
nearly
truth
in
his
testimony
before
the
immigration
authorities.
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
33,
he
says,
“i
don't
know
how
you
can
ask
counsel.
you
can
ask
me
to
find
for
the
plaintiff
here
in
view
of
his
admissions
and
statements
before
the
immigration
officer.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
certain.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
is
one
--
certainly
one
of
the
questions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
would
certainly
say
that
the
trial
judge
had
to
follow
the
standard.
if
he
did
not,
then
the
judgement
should
be
reversed.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
would
say
that
you
have
to
pay
due
regard
to
the
fact
that
what
--
findings
were
waived
and
that
this
is
an
oral
colloquy
which
is
taken
down.
we
believe
that
if
you
read
the
entire
record,
you
will
see
that
the
trial
judge
did
apply
the
standard
which
we
believe
and
which
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
yes.
that
--
that
is
right.
that
is
right.
the
court
has
to
be
satisfied.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
and
then
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
in
that
connection,
i
hope
the
court
will
bear
with
me
when
i
call
the
attention
of
the
fact
that
there
is
pending
case
on
the
ninth
circuit
in
which
an
amicus
curiae
brief
has
been
filed.
this
is
the
blue
amicus
curiae
brief.
in
that
case,
the
plaintiff
who
was
seeking
a
judgement
of
--
of
citizenship
has
waived
all
factual
issues.
he
has
stipulated
that
he
left
the
country
for
the
specific
purpose
of
evading
and
avoiding
the
draft.
that
case
is
now
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
are
two
therefore,
mr.
justice.
either
that
you
can
perhaps
say
some
trouble
by
deciding
it
here
or
that
you
can
wait.
in
either
case,
if
i
have
the
opportunity,
i'd
like
to
do
a
little
missionary
work
if
the
issue
was
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
would
say,
mr.
justice,
that
i
would
be
willing
to
--
to
--
i
didn't
quite
understand
the
postures
of
your
question
if
you
decide
against
me
on
the
issue
that
i've
been
discussing.
well
then,
of
course,
the
question
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
--
we
will
be
willing
to
stand
in
this
case
on
the
constitutional
issue
if
the
court
decides
on
our
favor
on
the
other
issues.
we
think
that
it
is
as
clear
as
in
the
case,
which
i
mention
just
before
so
that
we
would
be
willing,
from
my
point
of
view,
to
stand
on
this
case
as
well
as
on
--
on
the
other
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
true
but
you
asked
me
for
--
for
the
advocate's
point
of
view.
coming
now
to
the
--
the
question
which
was
being
discussed
at
the
close
of
--
of
the
argument
yesterday,
i
was
asked
whether
if
it
were
clear
that
petitioner
remained
in
mexico
because
his
mother
felt
that,
if
he
went
to
the
united
states,
he
would
be
drafted,
and
therefore,
subject
to
injury
and
death
during
the
war,
whether
that
would
be
a
fulfillment
of
the
terms
of
--
of
section
401
(j)
or
whether
that
would
be
another
type
of
purpose.
if
i
may
put
it
in
my
own
shorthand
way,
the
question
was
whether
his
purpose
in
--
in
that
situation
would
not
be
his
purpose
to
obey
his
mother
or
to
abide
by
his
mother's
wishes
rather
than
to
evade
the
draft,
and
i
was
asked
to
comment
on
that.
before
discussing
that,
the
legal
issues
involved,
i
would
like
to
summarize,
if
i
may,
for
the
court,
what
went
on
at
the
treated
administrative
hearings
that
did
took
place?
at
the
first
administrative
hearing,
which
is
included
on
exhibit
a,
there
was
hardly
any
mention
of
petitioner's
mother.
the
statements
i
think
are
pretty
clear
that
he
said
he
did
not
want
to
register
because
the
war
was
on.
he
did,
in
one
statement,
mention
his
mother
but
there
are,
if
i
may
run
through
them
very
short,
he
said,
"how
did
it
happen
that
you
were
not
registered
for
selective
service
before
april
19,
1946?"
because
i
did
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
page
--
it's
not
in
the
printed
record,
mr.
justice.
it's
in
the
exhibit
here.
"because
i
did
not
want
to
register."
“then,
why
did
you
not
register
at
the
american
consulate
in
chihuahua
near
your
home?”
“well,
i
will
tell
you
again,
i
did
not
want
to
register.”
“why
did
you
not
want
to
register
for
military
service
prior
to
1946?”
“because
i
was
afraid
to
register.”
“why
were
you
afraid?”
“i
was
afraid
in
military
service
during
the
war.”
then,
he
does
say
later,
“i
wanted
to
come
to
the
united
states
in
1942
but
my
mother
would
not
permit
me
to
do
so.
i
would
have
come
to
the
united
states
in
1944
or
1945
had
it
not
been
for
the
requirement
to
register.”
and
then,
later
on,
he
says,
“why
did
you
not
come
to
the
united
states
in
1944
or
1945
to
work
or
to
better
your
life?”
answer
-
“it
was
on
a
kind
of
a
war."
“do
you
know
that
hostility
ceased
in
august,
1945?”
answer
-
“i
knew
that
the
fighting
had
ceased
in
1945,
but
i
did
know
the
date."
now,
that's
the
first
hearing
in
october,
1947.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
the
one
sense
--
the
one
sense
that
i
did
read,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
“i
wanted
to
come
to
the
united
states
in
1942
but
my
mother
would
not
permit
me
to
do
so."
he
did
say
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
only
mentioned,
the
mother
in
the
first
hearing.
in
the
second
hearing,
there
was
considerably
more
mention
of
the
mother,
and
--
and
she
does
--
does
have
a
permanent
role
at
three
years
later
on
october
1950.
but
it
is
always
and
i
would
like
to
stress
this
to
the
court.
in
relation
to
the
mother
as
well
as
to
himself,
it's
always
the
fear
of
the
draft
and
the
fear
of
the
war.
there
is
not
a
suggestion
that
his
mother
wanted
him
to
stay
in
mexico
in
order
to
support
her
or
her
--
or
for
family
reasons.
it
is
because
his
mother
feared
that
if
he
went
to
the
united
states,
he
would
be
drafted.
so
--
so,
his
mother
does
play
a
prominent
role
in
the
--
in
the
second
hearing.
it's
always
in
that
connection.
now,
at
the
third
hearing
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
is
right,
and
now
that's
what
i'm
going
to
deal
with
when
i
come
to
discuss
the
legal
issues.
if
i
can
conclude
with
the
summary
of
the
hearings,
at
the
third
hearing,
he
again
emphasized
the
mother,
but
he
admitted
that
he
had
not
so
emphasize
the
mother
previously.
he
said,
“now,
i
wish
to
say
that
my
position
is
that
my
mother.
i
was
afraid
that
i
would
be
drafted.
i
was
not
afraid.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
through
an
interpreter.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
am
not
certain
whether
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
what
--
what
did
happen
is
that
at
the
second
and
third
hearings,
they
were
read
to
him
what
happened
at
the
preceding
hearings
in
spanish,
and
he
was
asked
to
make
any
corrections
or
to
agree
and
he
said,
“yes,
i
made
those
statements.
i
--
there's
no
use
in
denying
them.
now
i'm
with
the
view
that
my
mother,
that
the
real
reason
was
that
my
mother
was
afraid.”
but
to
answer
your
question
more
precisely,
at
the
administrative
hearings,
the
second
and
third
hearings,
at
the
second
hearing,
the
first
hearing
was
read
to
him
in
spanish.
at
the
third
hearing,
the
second
and
first
were
read
to
him
in
spanish.
now,
what
occurred
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
i
am
not
absolutely
certain.
the
hearings
were
available
in
english.
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
of
course,
for
several
years
later
and
he
had
become
--
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
literate
in
--
in
english
or
what,
but
he
had
certainly
would
become
--
been
able
to
speak
it.
i
was
able
to
speak
it
more
readily
when
he
was
in
the
earlier
days.
well,
that's
the
summary
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
he
repudiated.
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you're
--
you're
depending
on
the
witness
that
he's
been
impeached.
you're
on
the
witness.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
wasn't
our
witness,
mr.
justice.
we're
depending
upon
his
earlier
statements
which
were
admitted
in
evidence,
and
which
were
properly
admitted
in
evidence
not
only
to
impeach
him,
but
as
admissions
by
a
party
in
interest
which
the
commentators
and
putting
with
more
and
the
courts
universally
hold
if
admissible
as
substantive
of
permeative
evidence
to
prove
the
fact
in
which
it
can
be
relied
upon.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it's
a
witness
who
later
on
change
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
frequently
true
in
criminal
cases
when
a
man
makes
a
confession
and
then
comes
on
stand
and
denies
the
confession.
and
yet,
convictions
can
rest
upon
the
confession
later
on
repudiated.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you
may
not
have
other
witnesses
except
to
--
to
tangential
corroborating
matters
or
may
not
have
witnesses
to
the
intent
of
the
--
or
the
person
in
committing
the
crime
or
other
various
essential
factors.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
you
don't
have
witnesses
here
but
we
think
we're
entitled
to
rely
upon
what
he
testified
to
in
open
court
insofar
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
are
two
facets
to
it,
mr.
justice
clark.
one
is
a
general
rule
which
i
think
we
would
oppose
strongly,
a
general
rule
that
no
court
in
a
case
like
this
can
rely
upon
previous
admissions
made
in
administrative
hearings
which
whereas
detailed
and
circumstantial
and
as
repeated
as
often
as
--
as
this.
a
general
rule
against
that
we
think
would
be
harmful.
the
--
the
second
problem
is
whether
viewing
what
there
is
in
this
administrative
exhibit
plus
what
there
is
in
the
record.
if
the
court
is
not
convinced
that
the
standard
was
met
giving
due
regard
to
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
to
observe
the
individual
and
so
forth,
then
of
course,
we
have
not
met
our
burden,
and
--
and
that
is
a
matter
relating
to
this
individual
case
which
i
would
not
want
to
press
too
hard.
we
think
we
have
met
our
burden
in
this
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
haven't
been
many
court
cases
involving
expatriation
under
this
provision
of
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
court
--
the
court
--
well,
there
have
been
many
administrative
cases,
cases
that
have
been
before
this
board
of
special
inquiry
and
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
have
not
directly
come
to
the
court.
and
in
those
cases,
i
would
say
that
the
basic
evidence
is
an
admission
by
the
--
by
the
individual
himself.
there's
hardly
any
other
evidence
that
you
could
obtain
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
the
man
is
outside
the
country
and
as
the
court
said
--
and
the
issue
involves
his
intent.
and
as
the
court
said
last
year
in
the
case
involving
the
sincerity
of
the
conscientious
objector,
it
would
be
naïve
to
expect
that
he
would
make
a
public
admission
of
his
intent
to
evade
or
to
deceive
prior
to
--
to
the
institution
of
proceedings.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
have
been
three
or
four
in
--
in
california
but
there
had
not
been.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
what
i
meant
is
that
there
haven't
been
a
large
number.
there
have
been
maybe
50
administrative
laid
and
i
only
know
of
about
six
or
seven
throughout
the
country.
and
what
i
--
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
there
weren't
a
large
numbers
that
there
haven't
been
a
--
a
large
probative
cases
and
i
don't
know
what
the
practice.
what
i'd
be
willing
to
say
that
probably
the
basic
evidence
was
admissions
obtained
by
questioning
before
the
--
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
not
even
sure
of
that,
mr.
justice
--
justice
douglas.
the
report
of
the
committee
which
formed
the
--
which
formed
the
study
of
the
mccarran
act
said
that
in
1948,
they
had
a
statistical
table
for
the
year
1948
for
all
reasons
for
expatriation.
and
there
are
135,
they
said
in
the
year
1948.
now,
many
of
those
were
cases
which
have
been
administratively
determined
and
were
never
appealed,
i
mean,
never
brought
to
court.
some
of
them
were
administratively
determined
by
the
immigration
service
and
they
never
even
appealed
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
if
the
court
is
interested
on
this,
there
is
an
article
in
1948
in
--
in
volume
5
of
the
monthly
review
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
by
a
man
named
sharon,
s-h-a-r-o-n.
it's
by
monthly
review
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
1948.
and
he
reviews
the
recorded
decisions
or
--
or
the
filed
decisions
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
the
central
office
of
the
--
of
the
immigration
service.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
haven't
come
across
the
one
in
the
yale
law
review
on
this
particular
subject.
there
maybe
one,
i
think.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
think
he
loses
it
when
the
act
occurs,
and
just
as
he
loses
it
when
under
the
other
provisions
of
the
expatriation
act
when
the
act
of
taking
the
ultimate
allegiance
occurs
or
the
act
of
being
naturalized
broader
occurs
or
the
act
of
serving
in
a
foreign
army
occurs.
i
think
that
when
the
act
of
evasion
occurs,
he
then
loses
his
citizenship
but
there's
a
most
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
has
--
he
has
under
the
act
which
is
applicable
in
this
case.
he
has
a
method
of
review.he
can
bring
the
declaratory
judgement
act
under
former
section
503
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
not
sure.
i
mean
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
of
course,
not.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
when
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
these
issues
only
arise
in
the
form
of
proceedings
and
this
issue
arose
because
he
left
the
country.
he
first
came
in
as
a
citizen
in
april
1946.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i'm
talking
about
after
he
first
came
--
when
he
came
back.
he
came
back
as
a
citizen
in
april
1946
and
questioning
for
the
draft.
and
he
stayed
in
the
country
until
almost
a
year
later
then
he
went
back
to
mexico.
when
he
sought
to
return
to
the
country
in
october
1950,
it
was
then
that
he
was
questioned
at
the
boarder,
for
the
reasons
for
his
remaining
in
mexico
during
the
war
years
and
he
is
not
registering
with
the
consul
in
--
in
chihuahua
and
so
forth.
and
it
was
then
that
he
made
the
statements
which
i
read
initially
to
the
court
this
morning.
and
so,
on
that
basis
that
it
was
determined
by
the
immigration
authorities
at
that
time
that
he
had
lost
his
citizenship,
and
therefore,
he
was
excludable.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
he
--
there
were
three
exclusion
hearings,
mr.
justice
douglas.
at
that
time,
in
october
1947,
when
he
was
excluded,
he
went
back
to
chihuahua
and
stayed
there
for
three
years.
in
october
1950,
he
sought
entry
again
and
was
excluded
again
in
october
1950.
then,
in
may
1951,
he
crossed
the
boarder
claiming
to
be
american
citizen
and
he
was
--
he
--
he
entered
the
boarder.
i
forget
where
it
was,
el
paso
or
some
place.
and
he
--
he
stayed
in
the
united
states
as
an
american
citizen
for
--
oh,
i
think
until
january
1952,
and
then
he
left
to
go
across
the
boarder.
and
on
his
return
on
january
1952,
he
was
again
stopped.
and
they
had
the
record
of
the
preceding
hearings
and
he
had
another
hearing
in
january
1952
and
he
was
excluded
then.
so,
he
went
back
to
mexico,
but
in
may
of
--
of
1952,
he
again
entered
as
a
citizen,
claiming
to
be
a
citizen
and
that
he
wasn't
stopped.
and
he
was
picked
up,
he
was
--
a
warrant
of
deportation
was
issued
in
august.
so
that
he
is
--
and
tried
to
enter
the
country
three
times
and
then
stopped
and
entered
the
country
as
a
citizen
three
times.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
was
in
detention
but
he
was
in
detention,
i
understand,
prior
to
the
court's
decision,
but
i
believe
that
he
has
been
out
on
bail
or
parole
since
the
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
record
says
he
was
detained
for
six
months
in
the
terminal
and
that's
all
that
i
know.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
not
by
administrative
proceedings
in
the
sense
that
the
very
expatriation
provisions
which
are
quoted,
cited,
and
reported
at
the
end
of
our
brief.
they
are
all
involve
in
administrative
proceedings,
taken
being
naturalized
abroad
or
taking
an
oath,
or
entering,
and
serving
in
a
foreign
army.
those
all
come
--
come
into
being
by
virtue
of
the
administrative
determination
ill-advised
the
state
department
or
by
the
immigration
service,
that
person
has
become
expatriated
and
then
he
seeks
a
court
review
on
the
basis
and
there
is
a
de
novo
court
review
and
that
is
true
here.
this
was
a
de
novo
proceeding
and
we
cannot
rest
on
any
rule
of
substantiality
in
the
administrative
findings
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
expatriation,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
has
always
been
true,
mr.
justice.
that
has
been
true.
that
was
true
prior
to
the
expatriation
act
of
1907.
it
was
true
on
the
expatriation
act
of
1907
and
under
the
act
of
1940.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
loss
of
nationality.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
loss
of
citizenship
and
loss
of
nationality.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
has
been
true
for
about
a
hundred
years,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
it's
been
true
in
all
of
these
cases
that
the
--
there
have
been
various
active
expatriation
which
didn't
have
to
be
formalized
by
any
american
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
the
difference
is
this.
that
as
we
were
discussing
yesterday,
if
he
is
a
native
born
citizen,
and
he
comes
to
this
country
and
files
a
declaratory
judgment
act
and
he
proves
he
is
native-born,
then
as
i
said,
the
burden
shifts
to
the
government
to
prove
that
he
committed
an
act
of
expatriation.
we
would
argue
that
if
he
did
commit
the
act
of
expatriation
and
he
then
defends
on
the
ground
that
he
did
it
under
duress
as
his
claim
here
on
the
parental
duress
that
the
burden
shifts
back
to
him
to
prove
that
he
did
it
until
parental
duress.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
say,
mr.
justice,
that
they
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
and
that
--
that
has
not
been
the
practice
and
this
court
has
--
has
--
in
mackenzie
against
hare
in
1915,
the
court
has
held
that
mrs.mackenzie
had
lost
her
american
citizenship
some
two
years
previously
by
marrying
a
british
citizen
residing
in
california.
and
there
was
no
--
the
--
the
way
the
case
arose
is
that
she
wanted
to
vote
in
the
san
francisco
municipal
election
and
they
wouldn't
give
her
a
ballot
on
the
ground
that
she
wasn't
a
citizen.
she
lost
her
american
nationality
and
she
brought
the
suite.
and
this
court
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
think
it's
been
consciously
litigated,
mr.
justice.
i
think
it
has
been
assumed
on
almost
old
side
but
this
has
been
the
result.
it's
been
underlying.
it
is
under
--
underlying
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
field
of
loss
of
nationality
or
expatriation.
and
all
of
the
decisions
of
the
lower
court
as
far
as
i'm
aware
that
the
--
the
voluntary
commission
of
the
act
leads
to
the
loss
of
nationality.
you
can
get
a
review
of
whether
you
committed
the
act
and
whether
you
committed
it
voluntarily.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
by
a
court
proceeding.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice,
this
man
had
--
before
he
was
detained
at
the
terminal
hour,
he
had
already
been
administratively
determined
to
be
--
administratively
determined
twice
or
three
times
to
not
to
be
a
citizen
or
have
lost
his
citizenship.
he
did
not
seek
review
of
those
decisions
in
--
in
the
courts.
and
so,
the
administrators
followed
the
decisions,
the
three
decisions
which
had
previously
been
made,
and
he
wasn't
there
eyes
and
i
think
properly
so
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
since
he
had
not
sought
review
which
he
--
which
was
available
to
him
and
which
he
later
did
seek
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
--
since
they
were
--
he
was
in
his
eye
--
he
was,
in
their
eyes,
an
alien
now,
no
longer
an
american
citizen.
they
treated
him
as
they
treat
other
deportable
aliens.
that
is
he
had
entered
mexico
without
--
without
the
proper
credentials.
and
not
only
that,
he
entered
mexico
without
the
proper
credentials.
and
not
only
that,
there
is
another
statute
which
bars
aliens
who
have
--
who
stayed
abroad
in
order
to
avoid
resident
alien
or
aliens
who
has
stayed
abroad
to
avoid
service
in
the
--
in
the
united
states
army
from
coming
into
the
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
believe,
mr.
justice,
that
--
that
is
correct.
sometimes,
the
--
the
inspectors
just
take
your
word
for
it
or
look
at
your
birth
certificate
and
that's
how
he
crossed
three
times,
saying,
“i'm
an
american
citizen.”
he
had
his
birth
certificate.
he
showed
it
to
them.
but
of
course,
someone
who
is
not
an
american
citizen
and
claims
to
come
in
on
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
they
have
to
cross
the
border
if
--
they
have
to
--
to
cross
the
border,
they
have
to
be
american
citizen
or
to
fall
within
one
of
the
categories
of
--
of
admissible
immigrants.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
establish
in
the
sense
that
--
that
it
is
customary
for
the
inspectors
to
inquire.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
to
court
to
do
it
but
you
--
they
would
--
they
would
question
you.
they
will
look
at
your
passport
or
--
or
sometimes
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
sometimes,
they
accept
your
word
for
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you
may
have
to
go
to
court
and
there
have
been
--
there
have
been
people
who
have
done
that,
who
have
had
to
go
to
court
in
order
to
prove
that
they
--
if
for
instance,
they
didn't
have
a
birth
certificate
and
they
claim
they
were
born
in
the
united
states,
they
might
have
to
go
to
court
to
prove
that
they
were
born
in
there
or
if
they've
lost
their
naturalization
certificate
and
--
and
they
don't
have
it
available.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
