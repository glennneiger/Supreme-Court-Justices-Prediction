justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
--
go
ahead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
is
sufficient
excuse
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
old
was
he
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
the
--
a
difference
in
the
customs
and
the
habits
of
the
mexican
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
responsibility
or
the
obedience
that
a
parent
must
give
--
a
child
must
give
the
parent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
--
i
presume
you're
offering
us
not
to
show
that
he
could
obey
his
mother
over
the
government
but
his
reputation
of
the
charge
that
he
stayed
away
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
just
when
was
that
--
just
before
that
you've
said,
he
remained
outside
the
united
states
for
that
purpose
and
it
is
my
position
that
--
and
its
my
opinion,
i
know
these
cases
have
been
very
troublesome,
that's
just
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
talking
about
the
cases
of
men
who
had
gone
to
mexico?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
understand
--
you
understand
what
the
court
said
this
morning?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
right,
mr
--
i've
looked
now
at
the
statements
before.
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
it
was
the
main
worry
of
the
judge
was
that
he
had
nothing
except
an
admission
and
he
was
asking
for
cases
to
show
that
he
could
take
away
citizenship
on
a
non-corroborated
admission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
this
man
testify
before
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
did
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
other
proof
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
how
long
that
he'd
been
away
when
he
claimed
that
he
stayed
there
to
evade
service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
-
what
year
was
it
that
he
is
accused
of
evading
service?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
basis
of
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
actually
he
had
been
there
since
he
was
two
old
year
in
mexico.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
failed
--
he
stayed
away
from
here
in
order
to
evade
the
draft.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
remain
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
--
when
you
do
get
it,
i
hope
you
will
point
out
there
for
all
of
us
which
justify
the
finding
by
clear
and
convincing
proof
that
he
stayed
there,
in
a
state
mind
which
was
based
on
his
desire
to
evade
the
draft.
that's
your
issue
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
have
that
evidence
by
clear
and
convincing
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
anything
except
the
statement
he
made
to
the
officer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
other
officer,
any
other
testimony
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
whether
--
whether
they
had
proven
by
clear
and
convincing
proof
depends
entirely
on
the
statements
that
he
made
to
the
immigration
officer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
stayed
abroad
from
the
time
he
is
two
until
he
was
18.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
kept
staying
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
might
possibly
be
true
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
sometimes
happens.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
is
that
the
only
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
such
a
statute
is
made
demotive,
the
criteria
and
i
suppose
it
would
be
true
that
if
he
stayed
away
for
some
other
reason
rather
than
to
avoid
the
draft,
it's
immaterial
what
that
reason
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
look
at
his
motives.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
that
if
he
stayed
away
because
of
the
closeness
and
the
incloseness
of
his
mother.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
is
this
statement
to
that
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
it's
not
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
united
--
united
states
was
at
war.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
question,
the
other
statement
you
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
knew,
that
he
knew
that
it
was
not
merely
required
at
war
but
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
at
that
time
was
required
to
come
back
so
he'd
been
living
in
mexico
all
those
years,
was
required
to
come
back
and
register.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
knew
that
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
knew
all
about
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
we
will
find
and
if
we
lack
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
view
--
in
your
view
it
gets
down
to
that
one
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
a
major
crime
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
act
had
been
written
to
conform
a
--
a
--
shall
be
a
felony,
that
it
should
be
a
crime
for
any
citizen
to
remain
out
of
the
country
in
order
to
evade
the
draft,
punishable
by
taking
away
his
citizenship
and
it
said
no
more.
you
would
have
to
have
corroborative
evidence,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
just
had
what
i
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
the
words
had
been
that
it
should
be
crime
for
--
for
a
citizen
to
remain
out
of
the
country
to
evade
the
draft,
using
the
exact
language
as
you
have,
punishable
by
deprivation
of
citizenship,
then
evidence
could
have
had
to
have
been
never
used
to
corroborate
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
while
you're
--
while
you're
arguing
it
out,
i'll
--
i'd
--
i'd
like
you
to
refer
because
maybe
you'd
say
i
haven't
read
the
rest
of
it.
i
think
the
--
to
the
evidence
which
particularly
corroborates
with
that,
not
that
he
was
away
but
that
the
purpose
for
which
he
remained
away
was
to
evade
the
draft
rather
than
to
obey
what
many
people
think
is
very
important
to
turn
you
up
to
21
his
mother's
wishes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
corroboration
of
that
from
anybody
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
a
crucial
part
of
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
understand
that.
but
do
you
have
anything
to
which
you
can
point
that
would
corroborate
the
time
--
a
time
that
his
purpose
in
remaining
away
was
to
evade
the
draft,
rather,
even
his
admission,
rather
than
to
do
what
his
mother
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
--
you're
looking
for
his
corroboration
for
the
corroboration
of
that
crucial
point
to
other
--
they
are
parts
of
admission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
think
that,
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
your
corroboration
of
the
willful
purpose
to
his
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
answer
to
my
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
rather
crucial
to
me
as
to
that,
at
least
in
one
face,
for
this
reason.
the
statute
says
he
must
stay
away
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft.
i
think
all
others
can
understand
that
many
young
men,
and
i'm
inclined
to
think,
maybe
more
so,
in
mexico
and
other
countries
like
theirs
are
greatly
influenced
by
their
parents
up
to
the
time
they
get
to
be
21.
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
--
if
he
stayed
away
for
that
purpose,
if
that
is
here,
that
that
you
couldn't
prove
under
the
statute
because
i
think,
you'd
have
to
constrict
very
strictly
as
you
would
a
critical
statute.
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
say
that
he
stayed
away
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft,
even
though
that
may
not
be
a
good
excuse,
that
you
couldn't
say
either
the
act
you
had
proven
what
the
act
required.
that's
what
i'd
like
you
to
discuss
right
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
satisfied
on
that
and
the
question,
we
would,
on
your
side,
we'd
be
compelled
to
reach
the
constitutional
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could
have
--
that
he
could
have
his
citizenship
taken
away
from
him
as
a
punishment
without
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
regular
court
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
did
i
understand
you
to
say
yesterday
that
there
has
been
an
act
of
congress
before
this
one
where
congress
had
attempted
to
deprive
people
of
citizenship
born
in
this
country
by
administrative
proceedings?
