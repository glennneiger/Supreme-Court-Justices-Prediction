mr.
wirin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
have
a
--
an
interpreter
at
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
rather
--
this
is
rather
good
language
that
he
uses.
i
wonder
if
he
--
if
that's
his
language
or
the
language
of
the
interpreter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
oh,
but
i
was
thinking
of
the
boy
himself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
a
manner
in
which
the
interpreter
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
reported?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you'll
get
back
to
the
evidence
upon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
should
judge
harrison
made
that
finding
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
united
states
--
what
reposition
did
the
united
states
attorney
take
on
that
in
the
proceeding
before
judge
harrison?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll,
refer
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
refer
to
the
results.
chief
justice
earl
warren
20?
yes,
start
at
the
bottom
of
20,
page
20.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
you
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
you
were
with
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
grean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
grean.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
take
the
whole
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
grean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
the
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
court
and
whose
burden
is
it
to
prove
he
stayed
out
of
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
evading
military
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
prove
himself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
but
--
but
you
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
government's
always
taken
that
position.
i
wondered
if
they
took
it
below
in
this
case
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
ought
to
know
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
this
record,
you
ought
to
know
what's
in
this
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
is
that
put
--
does
that
mean
that
they
have
the
burden
to
prove
the
--
the
basic
fact
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
look
--
look
here
at
the
top
of
page
21.
the
court
says,
“i
am
looking
at
it
this
way,
counsel.
i
am
not
questioning
--
questioning
the
facts
you
made
--
that
he
made
those
statements.
that
is,
i
don't
question
the
government's
records
and
i
feel
that
his
denial
of
those
statements
breaks
down
his
own
testimony
here.
but
haven't
you
a
burden
to
prove
that
he
has
lost
his
citizenship?”
mr.
grean,
is
united
states
attorney,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
very
simple
to
prove
he
has
lost
his
citizenship
by
calling
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
show
that
they
have
excluded
him
on
the
ground
that
he
lost
his
citizenship
to
expatriation.
that
is
the
purpose
of
this
suit.
that
is
the
reason
why
we
are
here.
now,
doesn't
he
mean
by
that
that
the
--
that
the
burden
is
on
--
on
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
to
show
that
he
has
not
lost
his
citizenship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
read
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you'll
take
his
language
a
little
further
up
on
that
same
page,
he
says,
"i
feel
that
the
plaintiff
failed
to
make
a
case
here.
i
think
that
he
has
not
established
his
citizenship."
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
that
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
burden
is
on
him
to
establish
his
citizenship
in
this
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
it
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
had
not
established
his
citizenship.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
of
this
summary
statement
was
at
the
bottom
where
he
said,
"i
feel,
therefore,
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
a
judgment
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
boy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
view
of
the
purpose,
was
the
purpose
of
this
act
of
expatriation
punishment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
there
been
any
other
act
or
any
other
expatriation
act
that
had
punishment
as
its
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
that
--
did
that
act
take
away
all
of
their
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
citizenship
or
did
--
did
it
just
take
away
rights
of
citizenship?
i
thought
that
takes
away
the
rights
of
citizenship.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
no
nationality
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[laughs]
we've
got
him
astute
now,
have
we?
instead
of
being
not
a
--
not
very
much
of
a
peon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wasn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
i
wasn't
impressed
by
the
statement
of
judge
harrison
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
this
was
an
intelligent
man,
an
astute
man,
an
able
man
and
so
forth.i
never
--
i
never
got
that
impression.
he
said,
"this
boy
is
pretty
smart.he
isn't
--
he
isn't
a
peon.
he
--
he's
--
he's
had
a
little
education
and
so
forth.”
that's
the
way
the
judge
characterized
him.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
that
i
don't
get
that
he's
an
astute
man
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he's
is
an
able
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
and
to
think
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
also
in
this
fact,
i
--
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
that
the
record
showed
rather
clearly
that
from
1942
or
1943
on
he
wanted
to
come
back
to
this
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
he's
convicted
of.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
wanted
to
come
back
to
this
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
we'll
take
that
up
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
number
111,
gonzales
versus
landon.
mr.
davis,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
were
suggesting
that
--
if
that
question
will
presented
in
the
security
in
the
case
you
have
just
referred
to
and
therefore,
i
don't
know
if
therefore,
is
therefore
we
should
decide
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
in
there
about
the
mother,
about
the
influence
of
his
mother
in
that
speech?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
--
i
missed
that
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
only
mentioned
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
this
the
practice
and
is
this
the
usual
method
of
proof
and
--
and
can
we
take
this
as
a
typical
case,
the
department's
proof
in
a
case
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
kind
of
expatriation
do
we
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
justice,
i
though
judge
harrison
said
there
had
been
a
number
of
these
cases
and
he
--
he
hope
that
--
that
one
of
them
would
go
out
so
the
confusion
would
be
--
would
be
straightened
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
in
the
union.
chief
justice
earl
warren
another
one
of
the
yale
law
review,
isn't
it,
too,
on
the
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
under
this
act,
when
does
a
man
lose
his
citizenship?
does
he
lose
it
at
the
boarder
when
he
--
when
he
gives
these
statements
and
they
tell
him
that
he
can't
come
in
that
he
isn't
--
that
he's
lost
his
citizenship
for
or
did
he
lose
it
through
the
--
the
order
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
determines
that?
what
determines
that,
for
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
was
the
--
when
was
the
first
time
that
the
government
recognizes
that
he
has
lost
his
citizenship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
didn't
know
what's
in
his
mind
when
he's
on
this
little
five
acre
ranch
of
theirs
taking
care
of
his
mother
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
five
--
five,
four
or
five
sisters
and
brothers
in
a
little
five
acre
ranch
in
chihuahua,
the
government
doesn't
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
government
first
recognize
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he's
lost
his
citizenship?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
two
years
old
when
he
left
the
country.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
to
establish
their
american
citizenship?

justice
earl
warren
