justice

frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
quite
understand
that
you're
not
bound
by
what
merely
before
two
lower
courts
have
reached
their
conclusions.
but
is
it
your
suggestion
that
we
said
here
that
those
were
what
applies
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
like
coercive,
you
mean
he
wasn't,
the
--
the
obedience
to
his
mother
(inaudible)
justice
felix

mr.
wirin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
what
--
what
does
judge
harrison
refer
to
on
--
after
what
you
--
what
you
have
in
mind
on
page
33
as
to
the
part
of
in
which
you
challenge
this
laying
down
of
wrong
standard.
he
goes
on,
middle
of
the
page,
i
wish
someone
would
appeal
one
these
cases.
we've
got
another
and
i
would
like
to
have
the
opinion,
some
definite
line
of
cases.
what
is
he
talking
about.
on
what
does
he
want
to
rely,
wish
there.
i
wish
someone
would
--
would
appeal
one
of
cases.
that
presupposes
that
there's
a
series
of
case
presenting
a
common
problem.
now,
presumably
the
judge
would
have
had
in
mind
some
common
problem
that
worries
me.
otherwise
you
wouldn't
have
to
believe
any
more
lies
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
are
because
maybe
there
are,
was
made
there
on
the
arguments
that
on
the
question
put
to
you
by
mr.
justice
harlan.
is
there
some
standard,
some
issues,
some
--
what
we
call
a
--
a
question
of
criterion
or
a
criterion
rather
thatn
questions
of
credibility
was
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
not
even
talking
about
something
on
which
would
should
shed
light
on
these
series
of
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
i've
got
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
view
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
government
--
is
the
government
questioning
just
to
--
what
we've
said
that
was
decided
in
those
two
cases
and
other
queries
namely,
when
you
deal
with,
in
taking
away
citizenship.
it
certainly
can't
legal
(inaudible)
since
there's
no
difference
here
and
that's
why
it
shouldn't
be
enough
to
make
it
legal.
the
government
isn't
contending
the
man
was
proved
that
he's
entitled
to
a
citizenship
rather
than
to
have
solid
proofs
before
he
can
take
it
away,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
is
mr.
grean?
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
he
come
to
be
a
plaintiffl'sposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
doesn't
--
doesn't
the
act
establish
that
he
is
a
citizen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
what
they're
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
head
to
page
33,
look
at
the
top
of
page
21.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there
is.
the
burden
is
established.
as
soon
as
it
is
established
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
he
--
doesn't
that
contradict
what
he
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
later
on
--
later
on
he
said
he
didn't
know
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
deportation
and
denaturalization
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
from
different
levels.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
all
i'm
saying
that
this
court
has
made
to
grant
the
difference
in
deportation
proceedings
and
--
and
citizenship
deportation
proceedings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
totally
honest
with
you
on
your
(inaudible)
that
this
court
has
laid
down
a
rule
of
and
via
scrutiny
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
even
in
schneiderman,
the
baumgartner
cases
and
this
is
often
does
not
really
qualify
that
at
all
after
that
by,
at
least
your
mechanical
requirements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
crux
of
the
question
where
they
did
or
didn't
apply
those
standards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
whether
--
or
whether
the
record
is
unambiguously
clear
that
he
did.
isn't
that
the
real
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
throughout
under
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
none
of
the
constitutional
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
reaching
for
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
isn't
clear,
if
it's
cloudy
where
they
did
this
on
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
couldn't
agree.
the
court
has
to
be
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
he
was
not
evading.
suppose
one
accept
as
what
peace
and
quiet
as
to
waive,
could
he
get
the
question
in
purity
and
suppose
one
decide
against
the
government
on
the
question
you've
been
arguing,
what
do
you
think
then
--
what
would
you
submit
to
the
court
as
to
why
the
disposition
of
this
case
decided
against
him
on
the
constitutional
question
or
is
it
a
way
to
do
--
we
decide
the
constitutional
question
on
a
clean
record.
i
understand
that
--
that
for
us
to
determine
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
would
like
to
get
light
from
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
clear
from
your
point
of
view
but
they
may
be
different
on
this
side
for
that
reason
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
--
assuming
that
he
knuckled
under
the
court
--
of
the
power
to
decide
by
his
mother,
the
mother's
motif
in
exercising
such
instrument
is
immaterial
to
the
question
that
--
that
the
inference
was
exerted
upon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
davis,
i
got
--
did
i
get
the
right
impression?
do
i
--
do
i
refer
correctly
from
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
his
question
the
other
day
if
i
may
say
so,
that
unlike
denaturalization
prior
to
the
act
of
1940,
wherein
denaturalization
acts
affirmatively
to
be
a
statute
by
court
proceedings?
now,
an
act
not
at
all
formalized
or
authenticated
for
a
statute
but
merely
a
conduct
or
absolute
conduct
in
itself
to
get
the
denaturalization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon,
expatriation.
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
does
seem
necessarily
mean
denaturalization,
doesn't
it
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
loss
--
loss
of
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
citizenship
can
be
lost
by
an
unjudicially
established
act
of
congress
whether
the
man
doesn't
know
whether
he
has
or
hasn't
loss
his
--
until
he
either
wants
to
come
into
the
country
or
apply
for
a
passport,
or
applies
for
some
kind
of
significant
to
do
something,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
more
of
a
kind,
is
that
it?
that
it
is
a
surprising
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
the
statute
says
to
loose
his
nationality,
but
i
cannot
appreciate
it
unless
you
--
until
you
just
said
it
that
the
habit
shall
lose
his
nationality
means
that
the
government
didn't
have
to
go
to
a
court
of
law
and
establish
that
fact
but
rather
that
he
has
to
establish
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
comes
to
me
with
great
shock?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
--
i'm
merely
--
i
must
say
from
the
merit
that
the
impracticality,
the
power
to
it
that
by
something
that
a
man
gathered
or
doesn't
include
without
his
knowing
what
its
significance
is
ipso
facto
terminate
its
citizenship.
and
all
that
is
impart
of
thereby
rather
than
that
government
is
using
that
as
the
basis
for
establishing
the
fact
of
these
lawful
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
you
say
it's
100
years
old,
it
means
that
all
you
can
say,
i
tell
you,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
all
you
can
say
is
that
for
a
hundred-year
statute
that
said,
he
shall
lose
his
nationality
but
they
haven't
said
that
the
government
doesn't
have
to
go
to
court
of
law
and
establish
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
this
question
been
--
has
this
question
been
consciously,
purposefully
avowed
(inaudible)
that
somehow
rather
i
come
at
and
that
he's
never
had
to
issue
a
determination,
he
would
lost
his
citizenship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
he
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
have
to
go
to
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
that's
chin
yow
way
back
in
208.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
part
of
that
court,
some
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
justice
felix
frankfurter
try
to
keep
him
from
coming
into
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
this
a
stenographic
--
does
this
purports
to
be
a
stenographic
minute
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
of
the
--
not
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
we
say
corrects
were
not
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
using
those
synonymously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
doesn't
help
me
very
much
on
the
constitutional
question
whether
denaturalization
was
leading
to
a
subject
to
the
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
reference
to
promote
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
know
any
punishment
in
colloquial
terms
that
it
also
varies
to
be
a
constitutional
term?
