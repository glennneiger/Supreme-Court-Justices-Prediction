justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
your
kind
that
the
trial
judge
in
evaluating
this
(inaudible)
supply
the
wrong
standard
in
evaluating
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
it
isn't
merely
a
question,
preponderance
of
evidence?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore,
you're
asking
us
to
read
this
record
with
that
standard
in
mind,
it's
your
point
that
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
standard,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
--
there
was
no
dispute
about
that
all.
so,
that
it
is
our
position,
first,
the
burden
was
upon
the
government
to
prove
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he
had
lost
his
citizenship
and
that
the
burden
was
not
upon
the
petitioner
as
the
--
the
judge
said
it
was.
but
justice
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
our
position
is
a
little
bit
--
goes
beyond
that.
we
not
only
say
that
the
judge
used
the
wrong
standard,
but
we
say
even
if
he
used
the
right
standard,
that
is,
even
if
the
judge
had
said
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
to
prove
that
this
boy
had
lost
his
citizenship,
we
say
the
evidence
in
this
case
isn't
sufficient
to
support
a
ruling
of
loss
of
citizenship,
because
the
evidence,
and
we
think
your
honors
have
the
duty
to
appraise
the
evidence
yourselves,
as
you
did
in
the
baumgartner
case
and
in
the
schneiderman
case.
we
think
that
when
this
court
appraises
the
evidence
it
will
arrive
as
an
independent
conclusion
that
the
evidence
isn't
sufficiently
sturdy
and
solid
and
clear
to
warrant
a
loss
of
citizenship.
and
may
i
say
in
that
connection
that's
what
was
done
in
the
schneiderman
case
and
the
baumgartner
case
where
they
were
rulings
by
two
lower
courts
arriving
at
a
different
conclusion.
yes,
your
honor.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understood
just
what
you
meant
when
you
said
that
you
--
that
its
your
position
was
he
made
in
election
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
then
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
question
in
the
forfeiture
case
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
these
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
interrogation
in
each
of
these
earlier
hearings
through
an
interpreter?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
did
he
see
the
transcript
before
he
was
confronted
with
it
in
the
subsequent
hearings?
did
he
have
a
chance
to
go
over
the

justice
john

either
the
original
or
the
translation?
