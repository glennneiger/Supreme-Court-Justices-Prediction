mr.
davis,
did
he
go
to
mexico
at
two
and
stay
there
for
17
or
long
number
of
years?
what
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
your
--
your
duty
is
no
less
at
the
trial.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
realize
that
and
i
realize
to
protect
the
--
not
your
witness
but
do
you
say
why
with
the
burden
that's
all
together.
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
the
previous
prove
this,
these
facts
that
they're
unequivocal
if
under
rules
of
these
cases?
so
the
clear
evidence
that
you
present
to
my
mind
is
to
impeach
them
and
impeach
the
witness.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
have
no
other
evidence,
although,
it
seems
that
none
of
the
witnesses
were
available.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
have
other
witnesses
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
on
anyway
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
would
say
that
too
if
you
didn't
have
this
rule
of
their
convention
and
unequivocal
truth.
i
just
doubt
it.
i
didn't
come
into
any
conclusion
without
just
questioning
whether
or
not
this
is
that's
clear
since
conventions
such
unequivocal
proof
as
this
rule
required.
