mr.
a.l.
wirin
may
it
pleased
the
court.
this
case,
involves
the
laws
of
united
states
citizenship
by
a
petitioner.
he's
of
mexican
descent
but
he
was
born
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
when
he
was
some
two
years
of
age,
he
was
taken
by
his
parent's
to
mexico.
and
he
remained
in
mexico
until
he
was
22
years
of
age.
by
that
time
it
was
1946.
he
attempted
to
return
and
did
return
at
that
time.
district
court
ruled
that
the
petitioner
had
lost
his
united
states
citizenship
on
the
ground
that
he
remained
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
service
under
a
statute
which
provide
substantially
that.
the
statute
is
section
401
(j)
if
you
--
your
honors
will
find
it
at
page
2
of
our
opening
brief,
our
reply
brief.
it
is
quite
short.
it
is
--
it
was
adopted
by
the
congress
in
1944
during
the
war.
it
appears
towards
the
later
part
--
portion
of
page
2
of
our
opening
brief
and
it
provides
that
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
remains
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
united
states
or
leaves
the
jurisdiction
of
united
states
to
avoid
military
service
and
may
or
shall
loose
his
united
states
citizenship.
the
issues
which
are
before
your
honors
as
the
petition
have
used
it
are
three.
there
is
the
question
as
to
whether,
in
adopting
section
401
(j),
congress
exceeded
its
constitutional
power.
this
petitioner,
this
boy
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
not
by
naturalization,
not
--
not
by
grace
of
congress
but
by
virtue
of
the
mandate
of
a
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
so,
there
is
posed
in
this
case,
the
question
as
to
whether
congress
had
the
power
to
do
it
but
knowing
somewhat
the
course
of
decision
by
--
of
decisions
by
this
court
on
constitutional
questions,
namely,
as
to
whether
congress
was
within
or
beyond
its
power
in
enacting
the
statute.
i
shall
defer
that
issue
for
the
last
portion
of
my
argument,
for
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
other
justices
of
this
court,
would
remind
me
if
i
didn't,
that
this
court
will
reach
that
question
last.
we'll
reach
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
only
in
the
event
all
other
issues
have
to
be
disposed
of
adversely
to
the
petitioner.
so,
i
shall
travel
that
road
to
press
for
the
issue
of
constitutionality,
and
what
i
like
to
call
the
highroad
of
my
argument
is
last
and
turn
to
two
other
issues
first.
another
issue
is,
and
not
an
easy
one
or
could
the
congress
mean
by
this
statute.
what
is
its
legislative
history
and
more
particularly,
what
did
congress
mean
by
this
statute?
in
the
light
of
an
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
mexican
government
entered
into
1943,
which
agreement,
your
honors
will
find
set
forth
quite
fully
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
29
and
which
as
i
say
was
entered
into
in1943,
was
acknowledged
by
congress
in
1943
and
it
appears
in
the
57
statutes.
one
of
the
question
will
be,
whether
or
not
this
petitioner
who
did
not
leave
the
united
states
while
we're
at
war,
but
who
on
the
contrary
was
a
resident
of
mexico
while
we
were
at
war,
having
begun
his
residence
during
his
infancy.
one
of
the
questions
your
honors
will
have
to
decide
is
whether
or
not
he
is
covered
by
or
is
it
well
protected
by
the
provisions
of
this
agreement
between
our
government
and
that
of
mexico?
and
therefore,
his
conduct
does
not
--
is
not
covered
by
and
is
not
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
401
(j).
and
finally,
there
is
the
question,
as
to
whether
or
not
in
this
case,
the
evidence
is
so
clear
and
unequivocal
and
convincing
i
use
a
trio
of
words
that
this
court
has
used
in
the
naturalization
cases,
in
cases
involving
citizenship
whether
or
not
the
evidence
has
a
--
the
sufficient
clarity
or
is
so
clear
from
--
from
doubt
as
to
have
warranted
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
which
agree
with
the
trial
court,
directing
a
forfeiture
of
--
of
this
boy's
right
to
citizenship
directing
a
forfeiture
of
the
most
precious
right
that
any
human
being
can
now
have
on
the
face
of
the
earth,
the
right
to
american
citizenship.
let
me
take
as
i
have
listed
the
issues,
the
middle
road
first.
namely,
what
did
congress
mean
by
the
adoption
of
section
401
(j)?
and
what
is
the
significance
of
and
the
applicability
to
this
case
of
the
provisions
of
the
agreement
between
this
government
and
that
of
mexico,
the
terms
of
which
you
will
find
in
the
government's
brief
in
an
extended
footnote,
not
too
extended
really,
on
page
29
of
the
government's
brief.
let
me
summarize
--
i
--
quickly
and
i
hope
accurately
the
terms
of
the
provisions
of
this
agreement
between
the
government
of
united
states
and
that
of
mexico,
recognized
by
congress
and
reported
in
the
57
statutes.
in
1943,
our
government
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
government
in
mexico,
providing
that
the
nationals
of
either
country,
residing
in
the
other
may
be
registered
in
and
may
be
inducted
in
the
armies
of
the
other
country.
it
was
an
agreement
as
the
agreement
itself
provides,
for
instance,
particularly
in
paragraph
9,
which
your
honors
will
find
at
page
31
of
the
government's
brief,
it
was
an
agreement
which
we
had
entered
into
with
the
government
of
mexico,
as
the
agreement
itself
says
it
was
an
agreement
pertaining
to
military
service.
it
was
an
agreement
entered
into,
as
your
honors
will
find
in
paragraph
9,
for
the
common
war
effort.
and
as
i
say,
it
provided
in
the
first
place
that
in
american
citizen
residing
in
mexico
could
register
and
be
inducted
in
the
mexican
army.
seems
like
an
unusual
agreement,
of
course,
but
when
we
understand
what
its
purpose
was,
it
was
in
a
common
war
effort.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
agreement.
this
petitioner
living
in
mexico
registered
for
the
mexican
army
so
that
he
complied
with
paragraph
1
of
the
agreement
which
your
honors
will
find
on
page
29.
now,
let
me
hasten
to
add
this,
lest
i
mislead
the
court,
which
i
certainly
have
no
purpose.
we
are
not
urging
that
this
boy
complied
with
the
terms
of
this
agreement
because
he
knew
of
the
--
the
existence
of
the
agreement.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
in
point
of
fact,
he
did
comply
and
he
did
do
all
of
the
things
which
this
agreement
said
an
american
citizen
could
do.
now,
what
are
the
other
things
which
happened
or
which
--
which
--
what
he
did.the
agreement
further
provides
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
prior
to
the
--
to
the
date
of
disagreement
--
for
--
for
these
agreements
that
certainly
talks
about
a
common
--
a
common
war
effort
to
win
the
war.
i
do
not
know
the
exact
date.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
the
trial
court
made
no
findings
of
fact
and
as
to
that,
the
petitioner
is
as
much
as
fall
as
and
--and
anyone
else.
he
waived
the
requirement
of
findings
of
fact.
i
will
--
i
will,
mr.
justice
reed,
a
little
bit
later,
go
into
the
some
detail
on
the
--
on
the
factual
issues
as
to
whether
or
not
this
boy's
conduct
was
voluntary
and
the
other
circumstances
with
respect
to
his
not
serving
in
the
united
states
army.
the
only
argument
i'm
making
now
is,
that
what
this
boy
did
was
in
full
compliance
of
with
the
provisions
of
the
treaty.
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
treaty
further
provide
that
it
shall
apply
to
--
to
residents
as
permanent
residents
as
distinguished
in
temporary
residence.
that
phrase
doesn't
appear
in
the
treaty
but
the
treaty
says,
"that
students
are
not
subject
to
it,
that
those
--
that
border
crosses
are
not
subject
to
it.
the
officials
of
the
respected
governments
are
not
subject
to
it.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
this
treaty
is
at
page
29
of
the
government's
brief
in
a
footnote
and
extends
over
3
or
4.
now,
the
treaty
further
provides
that
when
a
--a
citizen
of
united
states
is
registered
in
the
mexican
army,
that
information
shall
be
furnished
to
the
american
government.
that
appears
in
paragraph
6
of
the
agreement
which
is
on
page
30.
and
that
applies
equally
where
a
--
a
mexican
national
registers
in
--
in
the
united
states
army.
the
record
discloses
that
when
this
boy
registered
in
the
mexican
army,
he
advised
the
persons
in
charge
that
he
was
born
in
united
states.
in
other
words,
then
he
made
a
statement
which,
of
course,
means
that
he
was
a
citizen
of
united
states.
the
agreement
further
provides
in
paragraph
9
and
it
is
paragraph
9
upon
which
the
petitioner
places
his
chief
reliance
that
either
country
in
his
discretion
may
request
the
other,
that
nationals
of
that
country
who
are
registered
in
the
army
of
the
other
or
inducted
in
may
be
released
from
that
army
and
the
transportation
facilities
will
be
--
will
be
furnished.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
the
effect
that
the
government
of
united
states
ever
requested
the
mexican
government
to
release
this
petitioner
although
the
inference
is
available
to
the
petitioner
that
the
fact
that
he
had
registered
for
the
mexican
army.
and
since
he
had
stated
he
was
born
in
united
states
that
the
information
as
to
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
doing
was
under
this
agreement
available
to
the
american
government.
and
now,
this
agreement
as
your
honors
will
note
in
paragraph
10,
the
last
section
of
it
which
appears
at
page
31
was
not
only
solemnly
recognized
by
congress
but
it
was
intended
to
be
a
meaningful
agreement.
it
was
intended
to
--
to
help
in
the
joint
war
effort.
it
recites
that
it
is
intended
to
be
for
the
duration
and
for
six
months
thereafter.
now,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
this
petitioner
did
know
more,
at
least
so
far
as
i
told
the
court,
than
what
he
had
a
full
right
to
do
under
the
provision
of
this
agreement.
now,
the
next
question
is,
what
did
congress
mean
when
one,
in
adopting
the
following
year
in
1944,
section
401
(j),
that's
at
page
2
of
our
--
our
brief
or
at
the
very
end
of
the
government's
brief
as
your
honors
prefer.
what
did
congress
have
in
mind
when
in
1944,
it
adopted
a
statute
which
we
have
to
confess,
on
it's
face
is
broad
and
which
suddenly,
on
it's
face,
makes
no
reference
to
the
agreement
between
our
government
and
the
mexican
government,
entered
into
and
acknowledged
by
congress
fully
the
year
before.
and
so,
we
are
required,
we
think,
your
honors,
are
required
to
take
a
look
at
the
legislative
history.
now,
we
think
the
legislative
history
to
those
considerable,
helpful
light
on
whether
the
congress
in
the
adoption
of
401
(j),
admitting
the
broad
language
of
401
(j),
intended
that
that
apply
to
a
boy
who
had
gone
to
mexico
in
his
boyhood
long
before
the
draft
law,
suddenly
without
any
relationship
to
the
draft
law
or
whether
the
--
this
is
intended
to
apply
essentially
to
those
americans
in
the
united
states
in
1944
while
we're
at
war,
who
were
then
leaving
the
united
states
in
order
to
avoid
military
service.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
i
--
i
can
argue
it
for
this
reason.
i
can
argue
it
because
in
the
first
place,
that
we
take
the
view
that,
however,
clear
a
statute
may
appear
upon
its
face,
if
the
legislative
history
discloses
a
particular
purpose
and
a
particular
objective
and
discloses
other
factors
which
where
the
only
factors
known
to
the
congress
that
the
legislation
adopted
by
--
by
congress
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
congress
said
was
its
--
was
the
purpose
when
the
statute
was
adopted
and
in
the
light
of
existing
agreements.
otherwise,
your
honor,
otherwise
the
--
the
court
or
i
would
have
to
take
the
position,
the
position
which
i
think
the
government
has
to
take
that
in
adopting
section
401
(j),
the
congress
attempted
to
annul
or
to
rescind
the
executive
agreement
made
between
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
government
of
mexico.
the
agreement
was
there,
the
agreement
continue
in
effect
and
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
discloses
that
this
--
the
401
(j)
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
those
who
are
subject
to
the
agreement.
i'll
be
--
spell
that
out
a
little
bit
--
a
little
bit
further
if
i
may
where
i'm
just
at
this
--
that
point
to
my
argument.in
our
brief,
we
have
attempted
to
give
your
honors
the
legislative
history
of
section
401
(j).
you
will
find
it
at
page
23
of
our
brief
and
following.
the
legislative
history
as
we
see
it,
and
of
--
with
respect
to
this
we
find
no
dispute
in
the
government's
brief
is
something
like
the
following.
401
(j),
first
arose
from
a
recommendation
made
by
the
department
of
justice
to
the
congress.
that
is,
to
the
two
committees
of
the
congress
that
were
concerned
in
the
matter.the
attorney
general
in
his
recommendation
to
the
congress,
referred
solely
to
americans
who
were
then
departing
from
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
military
service.
your
honor
will
find
acknowledgement
or
accreditation
of
this
claim
of
ours
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
61,
where
the
letter
from
the
attorney
general
to
both
the
house
and
the
senate
committee
is
referred
to,
and
where
it
appears
at
least
from
what
the
department
of
justice
was
telling
the
congress
that
this
legislation
was
aimed
at
citizens
or
aliens
who
left
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
evading
military
service.
and
as
your
honor
will
find
a
little
bit
later
on
page
61
of
the
government's
brief,
this
letter
of
the
attorney
general,
this
legislation
was
aimed
at
those
who
had
crossed
the
border
into
mexico
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
draft.
now,
when
this
letter
was
submitted
to
the
house
committee
and
the
senate
immigration
committee,
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
virtually
all
that
happen
before
those
committees
was
that
each
of
them
took
the
letter
of
the
attorney
general
and
submitted
that
letter
as
part
of
its
report
to
the
congress.
in
our
brief,
we
recite
the
colloquy
in
the
congress.
we
recite
the
statements
made
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
by
congressman
(inaudible)
who
was
responsible
for
this
legislation
on
the
house
side,
by
senator
russell
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
and
responsible
for
this
legislation
on
the
senate
side.
in
both
these
report,
there
is
only
a
reference
to
americans
who
were
leaving
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft.
and
then
in
our
brief,
we
cite
further
for
what
it
is
worth
of
an
opinion
by
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
an
opinion
in
1946
by
the
attorney
general
himself
in
which
this
legislation
in
discuss
--
is
discussed
and
which
again
it
is
recited
by
these
responsible
administrative
officials
that
this
legislation
is
aimed
against
those
who
were
crossing
the
mexican
boarder
in
--
after
the
draft
was
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft.
now,
mr.
justice
reed,
i
--
i
stand
here
to
confess
that
it
may
--
at
--
at
first
flash
and
before
reflection,
seem
that
i
am
in
a
difficult
position
when
this
statute
says,
"remain
to
argue
that
it
--
that
it
doesn't
quite
mean
what
it
says."
but
i
do
think
that
perhaps
the
resolution
of
the
problem
is
as
follows
and
decided
upon
you.
that
if
you
look
closely
into
the
legislative
purpose
and
history
of
section
401
(j)
and
if
you
keep
in
mind
that
just
a
year
before,
the
congress
had
enacted
--
the
congress
had
approved
or
had
accepted
an
executive
agreement
providing
that
americans
who
were
in
mexico
might
render
their
service
to
this
country
in
a
joint
war
effort
by
registering
in
the
armies
--
in
the
army
of
mexico
that
your
honor
can
read
the
executive
agreement
and
the
statute
together
ignoring
neither,
and
you
can
read
it
together
by
--
by
ruling
that
this
statute
was
not
intended
to
abrogate
or
to
negate
or
to
repudiate
the
agreement
but
it
was
intended
primarily
and
essentially
and
should
now
be
construed
as
to
those
americans
who
were
in
this
country
and
who
were
running
away
from
this
country
after
the
draft
and
in
order
to
avoid
the
draft.
well
now,
let
me
pass
on
to
another
consideration
and
that
is
the
lower
road
that
i
said
i
would
travel
with
your
honors.
and
that
is
whether,
assuming
this
first
argument
of
mine
to
be
insubstantial
and
unacceptable
to
your
honors,
whether
or
not
the
evidence
as
such
as
to
warrant
an
order
adjudging
the
petitioner
had
lost
his
united
states
citizenship.
there
were
justice
--
mr.
justice
reed
you
were
asking
if
there
were
findings.
they
were
not.
there
is
a
colloquy
or
there
are
comment
made
by
the
trial
court
after
a
very
short
hearing
and
your
honors
will
find
them
in
the
record
beginning,
that
is
so
far
as
the
judge's
comments
are
concerned
beginning
at
page
32.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
state
to
your
honor,
quite
simply
the
essential
facts
in
this
case
so
that
your
honors
can
determine
whether
or
not
the
evidence
or
warrant
an
order
adjudging
the
petitioner
lost
his
citizenship.
as
i
said,
this
boy
was
born
in
new
mexico
and
was
taken
there
when
he
was
two
years
of
age.
his
education
was
suddenly
very
meager.
according
to
the
record
he
went
to
a
mexican
school
up
to
the
age
of
10
or
11.
i
mention
some
of
these
facts,
now,
because
in
a
moment
i
shall
also
be
arguing
to
your
honors,
there's
some
statements
that
he
made
to
the
immigration
service
were
involuntary.
and
therefore,
the
kind
of
a
--
of
a
statement
upon
which
the
trial
court
relied.
and
therefore,
the
kind
of
a
boy,
the
kind
of
a
man
we
have
here
becomes,
of
course,
under
your
honors,
under
this
court's
decision
of
critical
importance.
his
education
then
is
fifth
or
sixth
grade
in
a
mexican
school,
10
years
of
age
--
11
years
of
age
to
be
more
accurate.
his
father
died
and
he
had
to
go
work.
work
where?
to
work
on
a
little
farm
in
the
remote
agricultural
community
in
mexico,
then
his
mother
had
arranged
to
use
and
made
some
arrangement
with
the
mexican
government.
what
kind
of
a
worker
was
he?
well,
his
testimony
is
that
he
worked
planting,
(inaudible)
planting
and
picking
corn
and
peas.
the
trial
judge
said
he
wasn't
--
didn't
look
to
him
like
peon,
like
much
of
peon,
but
i
submit
that
that
is
precisely
what
this
boy
was,
suddenly
so
far
as
his
occupation
and
education
is
concerned.
he
lived
some
10
miles
away
from
--
from
the
closest
small
village.
and
he
was
living
at
his
home,
at
the
home
of
his
mother
with
some
five
brothers
and
sisters,
all
of
whom
were
younger
and
all
of
whom
he
was
--
he
was
supporting.
there's
an
interesting
bit
of
evidence
as
to
the
--
and
amount
of
entertainment
this
boy
was
able
to
get
during
his
living
in
mexico.
up
to
the
age
of
22
years,
when
he
came
to
united
states,
he
had
gone
to
two
movies
and
the
reason
he
said
he
had
gone
to
only
two
is
because
his
mother
would
not
give
him
the
money
to
go
from
his
home
to
the
village
some
10
--
some
10
miles
away.
so,
we
have
a
boy
who
is
uneducated,
illiterate,
agricultural
worker,
living
with
his
mother
and
under
her
control.
in
a
moment,
i
want
to
tell
your
honors,
some
statements
that
this
boy
made
which
we
claim
were
involuntary,
when
he
was
first
questioned
by
the
immigration
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
made
many
statements.
he
was
questioned
some
four
times
by
the
immigration
service
prior
to
his
trial
in
court.
and
he
made
many
inconsistent
statements,
but
on
one
issue
there
is
terribly
consistency.
and,
that
is,
that
when
he
remained
outside
of
the
united
states
while
we
were
at
war,
he
was
doing
it
because
he
was
under
parental
compulsion,
because
he
was
under
the
coercion
of
his
mother
rather
than
because
of
any
free
and
voluntary
act
on
his
part.
now,
let
me
spell
out
for
you,
if
i
may
though
i
shall
try
to
make
this
not
too
repetitious.
the
numerous
occasions
in
which
he
asserted
and
reasserted
this
parental
compulsion,
the
trial
judges
as
a
matter
of
fact,
said
he
believed
what
this
boy
said
before
the
immigration
service,
much
more
readily
than
he
believed
what
he
was
telling
him
in
the
court,
because
said
the
trial
judge,
at
that
time
he
had
--
the
boy
hadn't
had
the
benefit
of
a
lawyer.
he
didn't
know
what
his
legal
rights
are
and
the
likelihood
is
that
what
he
said
before
the
immigration
service
then
was
more
accurate
and
truthful.
be
that
as
it
may,
this
boy
was
first
questioned
by
the
immigration
service
in
1947.
and
on
that
first
occasion,
as
we
show
rather
fully
--
much
more
fully
in
our
reply
brief
than
an
our
opening
brief,
on
that
very
first
occasion
when
he
was
questioned,
without
a
lawyer,
couldn't,
of
course,
speak
the
english
language,
spoke
through
an
interpreter.
when
he's
questioned
before
the
immigration
service,
he
said,
in
explaining
why
he
did,
wasn't
in
united
states
during
the
war,
he
said,
my
mother
--
he
said
at
the
first
hearing,
"i
wanted
to
come
to
the
united
states
in
1942,
but
my
mother
would
not
permit
me
to
do
so."
your
honors
will
find
that
on
page
11
of
our
reply
brief,
the
blue
colored
brief.
this
is
what
he
said
at
the
first
hearing,
before
a
lawyer
talked
to
him,
before
he
knew
what
his
rights
were.
he
was
ordered
excluded.
he
wouldn't
take
no
for
an
answer.
so,
he
attempted
to
come
back
again
in
1950.
and
he
was
stopped
at
the
border
again
and
he
was
given
another
hearing.
and
at
this
hearing,
he
explained
again
to
the
immigration
service
why
he
didn't
come
back
to
the
united
states.
he
talked
of
his
mother.
and
he
said,
and
this
appears
on
page
11,
also,
of
our
reply
brief,
"she
would
not
let
me
come.
i
asked
her
for
permission
but
she
would
not
give
it
to
me."
here
is
a
boy,
here
is
a
boy
living
with
his
mother
and
working
on
the
--
on
their
own
family
plot,
supporting
his
mother
who
had
to
have
permission
from
his
mother
and
who
--
so
--
so
he
thought
in
order
to
leave
the
family
home
and
because
his
mother
--
his
father
was
dead,
have
been
dead
many
years,
because
of
the
importance
in
his
life
of
his
mother,
he
felt
he
had
to
have
her
permission.
she
wouldn't
give
it
to
him
and
so
he
--
he
didn't
return.
and
again
at
the
same
hearing,
he
explained
that
he
remained
in
mexico
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
my
mother.
to
him,
to
this
mexican
boy,
to
this
mexican
peon
if
you
will,
the
wish
of
his
mother
was
his
command.
and
he
listened
to
that
command
and
he
yielded
to
it.
and
he
may
have
violated
his
obligation
under
the
selective
service
act,
but
he
was
under
parental
compulsion
in
doing
so.
he
was
preferring
the
wish
or
the
desire
or
the
will
of
his
mother
under
whose
control
he
was,
all
times,
to
obligations
which
under
the
law
he
undoubtedly
had.
and
at
the
third
hearing,
again
before
he
was
in
court,
again
before
he
had
a
lawyer,
for
to
none
of
these
proceedings
except
in
court
did
he
have
a
lawyer.
he
gave
the
simple
common
--
the
simple
explanation.
he
had
no
money
to
hire
a
lawyer
because
he
didn't
have
even
enough
money
to
go
to
a
movie
some
10
miles
away
during
this
--
during
this
period
or
and
--
and
later.
and
so,
at
the
third
hearing,
and
your
honors
will
find
that
on
page
14
--
on
page
15,
he
said,
"my
mother
did
not
wish
me
to
return.
i
obeyed
her
wishes."
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes.
let
me
say
--
say
a
word
of
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
there's
no
dispute
about
that,
but
there
is
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
there
can
be
no
--
i
--
i
--
there
can
be
no
dispute
about
the
correctness
of
what
i
--
of
this.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
of
what
i'm
now
saying
to
you,
your
honor,
on
what
appears
in
our
brief.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
say
there
is
no
dispute.
i
don't
anticipate,
indeed
they
are
the
exact
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
oh,
not
at
all.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
the
immigration
service
furnished
the
interpreter.
now
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
the
--
the
immigration
interpreters,
your
honor,
use
their
language.
they
know
what
these
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
we
--
we
cannot
tell,
your
honor.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
all
we
know
is,
what
it
looks
like
in
translation
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
--
the
immigration
service
furnished
the
--
the
translators.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
a
little
bit
later,
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
argue
that
with
respect
to
some
other
statements,
he
denies
that
he
made
them.
and
he
claims
he
made
them
under
coercion.
all
i'm
arguing
now,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statements
which
he
made
to
the
immigration
service,
these
are
the
ones
i'm
now
referring
to,
all
of
disclose
parental
compulsion.
and
i
don't
take
--
there
is
no
dispute
that
he
made
these
statements
that
i
am
now
referring
to.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
oh
no,
oh
no.
i
--
i
am
conceding
to
your
honor,
that
in
other
respects
he
made
statements
which
he
later
denied
when
the
trial
came
on.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
in
just
one
little
respect
an
over
statement.
it
was
stipulated
that
if
the
immigration
officers
were
called,
they
would
testify
that
the
transcripts
were
correct.
they
would
testify
that
the
witness
had
made
those
statements.
now,
there
was
no
stipulation
beyond
that.
and
there
was
on
his
part
a
statement
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
--
at
the
trial
that
some
of
the
statements
which
he
gave
to
the
immigration
service
were
involuntary.
that
he
was
under
confusion
and
that
he
was
scared.
now,
if
they
be,
i'm
in
--
in
an
inconsistent
position.
i
--
i
am
relying
on
part
of
the
statements
he
made
before
the
immigration
service
as
clearly
disclosing
compulsion.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes.
yes,
the
trial
did
its
--
did
--
did
resolve
that
by
saying
that
he
did.
but
whether
or
not
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
except
that
on
the
issue
of
parental
compulsion,
there
is
no
dispute
of
any
kind.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
and
i'm
--
but,
your
honor,
i
am
now
speaking
of
parental
compulsion.
and
i'm
saying
--
i'm
saying
that
if
you
take
all
of
the
--
the
testimony
he
gave
before
the
immigration
service
that
out
of
it,
it
is
clear
that
he
was
under
parental
compulsion
and
therefore,
it
is
clear
that
his
staying
away
from
the
united
states
during
the
time
of
war
was
not
his
free
and
voluntary
act.
and
therefore,
the
government
didn't
carry
the
burden
which
it
has
to
carry
in
a
--
in
a
case
involving
citizenship
of
a
showing
that
he's
actually
was
free
and
voluntary.
but
i
think
i
believe
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
the
court
made
no
reference
to
not
believing
the
parts.
the
court
did
say
that
he
did
not
believe
him
when
he
said
that
he
did
not
know
there
was
a
war
which
--
which
the
boy
did
say.
now,
let
me
go
into
that
right
now
then.
and
to
--
and
to
give
your
honors
our
argument
as
to
statements
which
he
made
before
the
immigration
service,
which
certainly
are
not
helpful
to
him
as
i
have
now
claimed
certain
statements
to
be
helpful
to
him,
namely,
the
matter
of
coercion.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
it
is
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
it
is
also
that
and
may
i
answer
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
--
that
right
now.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
it
is
that
and
a
little
bit
more.
in
the
first
place,
we
say
that
the
trial
court
used
their
own
standard.
that
the
trial
court,
when
he
came
to
making
the
decision,
ruled
that
the
burden
of
truth
was
upon
the
petitioner
to
prove
his
right
to
citizenship
whereas
we
say
the
proper
standard,
a
standard
enunciated
by
this
court
in
denaturalization
cases
which
applies
also
where
citizenship
has
--
has
been
taken
away.
that
the
burden's
upon
the
government
to
carry
the
proof
of
loss
of
citizenship.
and
we
say,
and
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
32,
your
honor
you
might
want
to
take
a
quick
look
at
it.
in
the
record
at
32
--
i
said
32,
i
mean
33,
middle
of
the
page,
i
feel,
just
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
i
feel,
the
judge
said,
"i
feel
that
the
plaintiff
failed
to
make
a
case
here.
i
think
that
he
has
not
established
his
citizenship."
now,
first
our
argument
is,
that
the
judge
was
applying
a
wrong
standard.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
no.
all
i
--
i'm
just
trying
to
suggest
some
kind
of
a
middle
--
of
a
middle
road
maybe
something
like
this.
that,
of
course,
you
do
not
ignore
what
the
trial
court
said.
and
you
give
it
all
the
deference
that
it
deserves.
but
in
the
case
involving
citizenship,
it's
involving
taking
away
a
naturalization,
where
there
are
imponderables,
where
there
are
attitudes
towards
the
citizenship
which
are
really
more
than
merely
simple
issues
of
fact.
that
your
honors
will
take
a
look
at
the
whole
case
and
arrive
at
a
decision
as
to
whether
the
evidence
is
solid
and
will
--
and
will
support
the
judgement.
and
that
brings
me
to
a
consideration
of
why,
assuming
now,
the
evidence
is
not
clear
from
the
statements
he
made
to
the
immigration
authority
that
he
was
acting
under
parental
compulsion.
why?
nonetheless,
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
in
our
opinion
to
warrant
the
judgment.
it
is
this.
let's
say
there's
no
question
that
when
this
boy
was
first
questioned
by
the
immigration
service,
he
was
asked
whether
or
not
it
wasn't
true
that
he
had
remained
outside
of
united
states
from
a
certain
specific
date
in
1944
to
another
specific
date
in
1946
for
the
sole
purpose
of
avoiding
service
and
that
according
to
the
record,
he
gave
a
categorical
yes
answer
to
that
question.
we
do
not
deny
that
the
record
shows
that
he
said
that.
as
i'm
telling
--
as
i
was
saying
to
mr.
justice
reed
at
the
trial,
he
said
that
he
was
confused
before
the
immigration
service.
he
said
that
he
was
scared
and
he
said
--
he
said
that
he
attempted
to
tell
the
immigration
authorities
that
the
reason
he
remained
in
mexico
was
not
because
he
was
afraid
of
the
draft,
but
because
his
mother
was
afraid
for
him
to
come
to
united
states.
and
he
explains
in
the
record
of
the
trial
that
when
he
told
this
to
the
immigration
service
they
said
to
him,
"this
is
not
a
sufficient
excuse."
and
there
upon
he
agreed
with
them
that
the
reason
he
stayed
out
was
to
avoid
the
draft.
now,
he
explains
at
another
place,
and
i'd
like
to
find
it
if
i
may,
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
16
--
in
our
reply
brief,
the
blue
brief
at
page
16,
the
italicized
portion
towards
the
center
of
the
page.
they
said
it
--
they
thought
it
was
--
i
was
afraid,
and
not
because
my
mother
was
afraid.
so,
i
told
them
to
put
down
whatever
they
liked
there.
now,
this
is
in
the
record
of
the
immigration
service.
this
is
something
he
said
to
them
before
he
was
in
court
and
before
a
lawyer
could
help
him
fix
up
his
testimony.
what
he
had
told
the
immigration
service
at
a
later
hearing,
was
that
he
had
--
had
attempted
to
explain
to
them
that
the
real
reason
why
he
didn't
come
back
was
because
of
the
influence
of
his
mother,
didn't
call
it
coercion.
he
didn't
call
it
compulsion.
these
are
my
words
but
because
of
the
wishes
of
his
mother,
and
they
said
to
him,
"that
isn't
a
sufficient
excuse."
and
they
said
to
him,
"that
isn't
so."
so,
he
said,
“put
down
whatever
you
like.”
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
--
i
say,
your
honor,
that
if
a
boy
is
acting
under
the
influence
of
his
mother
so
that
it
reaches
the
dignity
of
parental
compulsion,
then
what
he
does
even
if
it
include
staying
away
from
united
states,
he
is
doing
under
compulsion
and
not
as
his
free
act.
and
that
one
should
not
lose
his
citizenship,
if
what
he
does
is
a
coercive
act
as
distinguished
from
the
free
and
voluntary
act.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes.
i
--
and
i
mean
just
a
little
bit
--
i
--
and
just
a
little
bit
more.
i
mean
--
i
mean
the
kind
of
sanctions
which
a
mother
in
a
rural
community
in
mexico
has
over
a
boy
who
--
who
has
not
had
a
father
for
a
long
time.
i
mean
that
that
kind
of
devotion
to
a
mother
and
that
kind
of
control
which
a
mother
has
over
a
boy
is
the
equivalent
of
legal
compulsion.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
he
was
then
18,
19,
20.
he
was
22
when
he
came
back
to
united
states.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
there
is
nothing
in
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
is
discloses
that.
there
is
a
reference
to
a
--
to
a
treatise
on
the
subject
which
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
to
the
effect
on
page
9
of
our
reply
brief,
to
the
effect
that
in
--
in
mexico,
the
family
ties
are
--
i
refer
to
portions
--
the
last
portion
of
page
9.
professor
bills
who
is
a
reasonably
well-known
expert
on
the
mores
and
the
customs
and
the
compulsions
in
mexico,
takes
the
view
that
in
it
appears
on
page
9
and
10
that
the
family
is
an
overriding
institution
in
latin
america.
i
would
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
offer
it
to
show
that
and
--
and
confessedly
also
to
show
that
he
was
under,
that
he's
staying
away
from
the
united
states
under
any
circumstances
was
motivated
because
of
an
obligation
to
his
mother.
and
therefore,
he
was
under
parental
compulsion
and
therefore,
he's
staying
away
was
not
his
free
and
voluntary
act.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
right.
let
me
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
i
--
i'm
sure
i
can't
be
certain
as
to
--
as
to
what
was
in
his
mind
but
i
--
but
i
think
i
know.
one
of
the
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
in
the
first
place,
just
before
he
said
that
is
the
paragraph
in
which
he
said,
“i
feel
that
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
make
a
case
here."
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
he
was
certainly
talking
about
other
cases
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
i
--
i
think
i
can
that
--
i
can
answer
both
--
both
questions
or
at
least
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
--
let
me
try.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
a
problem
in
the
case
as
to
where
the
burden
of
proof
was.
and
at
the
very
beginning,
this
judge
took
the
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
pardon?
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
the
judge
thought
there
a
problem.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
the
--
the
judge
thought
there
was
a
problem.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
the
government
is
not
contending
so
here,
but
it
did
in
the
court
below.
for
instance,
in
the
record
at
page
20,
although
judge
harrison
thought
that
this
court's
views
were
--
well,
let's
look
at
page
20
while
we're
looking.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
court
-
and
mr.
grean
--
yes.
the
court
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
he's
united
states
attorney,
assistant
united
states
attorney
right?
the
court
-
“and
whose
burden
is
it
to
prove
he
stayed
out
in
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
evading
military
service?”
mr.
grean
-
“the
plaintiff
have
that
burden.
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
his
right
to
a
judgment
of
nationality
from
this
court.”
mr.
a.l.
wirin
oh,
he
--
he
filed
a
suit.
he
--
the
petitioner
had
filed
a
suit
under
a
provision
of
the
nationality
act,
asserting
his
united
state
citizenship.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
the
government
claimed
he
had
lost
it.
well,
before
--
because
the
case
was
through,
the
united
states
attorney
has
it
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
he
did,
of
course,
by
showing
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
--
that
he
was
born
in
united
states.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
that
--
that
was
not
disputed
at
all.
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
to
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
before
the
united
states
attorney
got
through
with
this
--
with
--
with
the
judge
in
the
case,
the
judge
finally
agreed
with
united
states
attorney
and
took
the
view
appearing
on
page
33.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
did
i
miss
something
there?
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes.
that's
what
the
judge
said
then,
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
and
that
is
right.
but
by
the
time
he
came
to
make
his
judgement,
he
had
been
persuaded
by
this
very
persuading
young
los
angeles
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
agreed
with
mr.
grean
and
at
page
33
took
the
view
and
handed
down
a
decision
based
upon
that
view,
i
feel,
that
the
plaintiff
failed
to
make
a
case
here.
i
think
that
he
has
not
established
his
citizenship.
now,
that
answers
only
half
of
the
question
that
your
honor
asked.
let
me
try
to
answer
the
second
half.
what
it
was
that
was
troubling
this
judge.
at
the
trial,
this
petitioner
denied
that
he
stayed
out
of
united
states
to
avoid
service.
he
had
admitted
it
before
the
immigration
service.
and
those
admissions
were
introduced
in
evidence.
now,
the
judge
wanted
to
know,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
whether
or
not
the
receipt
of
these
admissions
constituted
affirmative
evidence
warranting
the
denial
of
citizenship
or
whether
or
not
in
point
of
fact
on
law,
these
admissions
had
only
the
quality
of
impeaching
what
the
petitioner
had
testified
to
and
therefore,
there
was
no
evidence
either
way
and
therefore
under
baumgartner
and
schneiderman,
the
government
hadn't
carried
his
case.
now,
mr.
grean
succeeded
in
convincing
the
judge,
the
trial
judge.
this
is
one
of
the
issues
we
raised
in
this
case
and
in
our
brief.
that
admissions
are
admissible
not
only
for
impeachment
purposes,
they
clearly
were
that,
but
that
they
also
have
the
quality
and
dignity
of
affirmative
evidence
sufficient
to
--
to
carry
a
--
a
burden
of
proof.
and
that's
one
of
the
issues
which
we
think
this
court
may
have
to
decide.
now,
one
final
word
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
proof
and
then
i
think
i
shall
be
done.
the
admissions
which
the
petitioner
made
before
the
immigration
service
were
virtually
confessions.
and
i
want
to
talk
about
the
opper
case,
and
smith
against
united
states
and
the
problem
of
confessions,
and
the
--
the
quality
of
evidence
which
is
here.
i
would
just
say,
mr.
justice
reed,
that
when
this
boy
admitted
in
the
first
hearing
before
the
immigration
service
that
he
remained
outside
of
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
service,
it
was
virtually
a
confession
because
he
was
confessing
to
having
violated
the
draft
law.
now
then,
this
court
seems
to
have
decided
pretty
clearly
that
at
least
in
criminal
cases,
confessions
require
corroboration
and
that
both
only
confessions,
mr.
justice
reed,
in
the
upper
case
said
that
admissions
require
corroboration
where
the
prosecution
is
a
criminal
one.
now,
this
court
has
not
yet
decided
and
we
think
this
is
an
appropriate
case
in
which
it
may.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
where
the
proceeding
is
not
technically
criminal
but
whether
sanctions
are
more
severe
than
in
a
criminal
case,
the
sanction
of
laws
of
united
states
citizenship,
this
precious,
most
precious
of
our
rights,
this
court
it
seems
to
me
is
now
faced
with
the
problem,
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
not
rule
that
in
a
case
involving
citizenship,
confessions
and
admissions
require
corroboration
just
as
this
court
has
clearly
ruled
confessions
and
admissions
where
the
proceeding
is
a
criminal
one,
require
corroboration.
and
if
the
court
takes
that
view
and
applies
it
to
this
case,
then
we
say
there
has
not
been
sufficient
evidence
to
carry
the
burden,
this
court
has
said
in
the
baumgartner
case
and
the
schneiderman
case,
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
the
denial
of
a
citizenship
to
one
born
in
the
united
states.
i
had
originally
intended
to
argue
the
problem
of
constitutionality.
i
--
i
reserve--
reserve
the
right,
if
i
may,
to
change
my
mind
and
to
rely
upon
the
argument
--
arguments
which
appear
in
our
briefs
on
--
on
that
subject
and
to
reserve
what
remaining
time
i
may
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
well,
that
i
wasn't
--
an
embarrassment
which
i
was
going
to
confess
to
--
sometime
ago
and
now
i
confess
it
for
the
boy.
this
printed
of
record,
this
is
a
case
in
forma
pauperis.
and
that
this
court
after
--
after
it
granted
certiorari,
permitted
the
printing
of
the
record.
the
printed
record
contains
only
what
took
place
in
the
trial
court.
in
the
trial
court
there
was,
however,
admitted
by
stipulation
a
transcript
of
the
proceeding
before
the
immigration
service.
that
is
available
to
your
honors
in
that
it
is
in
the
clerk's
office.
we
have
suggested
that
perhaps
it
should
be
printed,
the
clerk
who
is
very
--
who
wants
to
(inaudible)
the
resources
of
this
court
that
fixed
perhaps
it
need
not
be
printed
since
it
is
available
to
your
honors
and
we
do
not
press
the
matter
any
further.
but
it
--
but
those
statements
are
in
the
record
of
the
trial
in
that
they
were
received
in
evidence,
and
marked
exhibit
a
in
the
trial.
and
as
i
say,
it
is,
the
record
is
available
to
your
honors
in
the
office
of
the
clerk.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
your
honor
is
100%
right.
now,
there
was
a
big
dispute
in
the
trial
as
to
what
wigmore
had
said
about
it
and
mr.
grean
convinced
--
convinced
the
trial
judge
that
--
that
the
present
view
of
mr.
wigmore
is
the
better
than
his
former
view.
originally,
mr.
wigmore
took
the
view
that
admissions
are
not
the
equivalent
of
affirmative
testimony
but
are
admissible
only
for
the
purpose
of
impeaching
testimony.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
this
man
testified
before
the
judge
--
mr.
a.l.
wirin
--
denied
any
--
any
intent
to
remain
outside
of
the
united
states
during
--
during
the
war
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
draft
was
confronted
with
the
admission
which
he
made
during
that
first
--
first
hearing.
and
the
judge
accepted
that
admission
and
posited
his
ruling
upon
that
admission.
mr.
a.l.
wirin
absolutely
none.
