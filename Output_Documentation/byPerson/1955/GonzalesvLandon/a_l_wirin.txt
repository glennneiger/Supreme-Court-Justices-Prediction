mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
to
an
answer
a
question
asked
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
other
justices
as
to
whether
there
are
other
similar
cases.
i
can
just
say
this.
there
are
about
a
dozen
similar
cases
now
pending
in
the
district
court
at
los
angeles,
and
when
judge
harrison
was
talking
about
the
problem,
he
was
referring
to
the
problem
which
he
and
the
other
judges
of
that
court
will
face
by
about
these
dozen
cases.
there
are
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
meaning
by
that
merely
that
this
is
not
an
isolated
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--there
are
similar
cases.
--
meaning,
when
you
say
similar,
meaning
by
that
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
meaning
by
that,
persons
who
had
remained
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
meaning,
persons
who
have
remained
in
mexico
during
the
war
and
with
the
respect
to
whom
the
immigration
service
was
claiming
that
they
have
lost
their
citizenship
under
section
401
(j).
now,
one
other
matter
with
respect
to
a
question
put
by
mr.
justice
harlan
to
mr.
davis.
i
think
mr.
davis
gave
the
impression
to
this
court.
i'm
sure
he
didn't
intend
it.
that
the
first
time
that
this
petitioner
deny
the
admissions
--
denied
that
he
made
admissions
was
at
the
court
trial.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
before
the
immigration
service
in
1952,
before
he
had
a
lawyer,
before
he
had
a
trial,
before
the
immigration
service,
he
said
to
the
immigration
service
when
confronted
with
the
translation
of
his
former
statements
that
he
had
not
made
them
and
that
he
--
that
the
--
that
the
immigration
officers
had
confused
him
and
that
it
was
not
voluntary.
now,
the
word
“voluntary”
appears
of
course
in
the
english
translation
since
they
were
--
since
they
were
--
this
translation
was
by
immigration
inspectors.
but
in
any
event,
a
rejection
of
his
admissions,
a
claim
that
the
admissions
were
not
made
and
at
the
transcript
of
the
statements
were
not
correct,
was
made
by
him
before
the
immigration
service.
yes,
sir?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
did.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
no,
of
the
english
--
well,
no.
it
was
--
there
was
a
stenographic
record
in
english
which
was
read
to
him
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
not
of
the
spanish.
that
was
read
to
him
by
an
interpreter
and
he
was
asked
what
he
had
to
say
about
his
former
statements
and
he
said,
“they
are
incorrect,”
that
they
were
not
--
they
are
not
voluntary.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
was
confused.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
appears
in
the
1952
hearing
at
page
12.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
he
--
he
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
using
not
synonymously.
he
said
both.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
he
denied
and
he
made
them.
he
said
in
some
respect
that
it
is
incorrect
and
he
said
it
wasn't
(inaudible)
he
said
the
record
shows
that
he
said
it
wasn't
voluntary.
again,
i
say
that
wasn't
his
word.
we
don't
know
what
word
he
used
in
spanish.
that
is
the
word
which
appears
--
which
was
interpreted
by
the
--
by
the
immigration
inspector
interpreter
as
to
what
he
said
about
it.
the
chief
justice
asked
two
questions
that
i
think
should
be
answered.
one
question
was,
to
mr.
davis,
and
my
answer
is
different
from
the
one
given
by
mr.
davis,
whether
the
statute
had
--
was
penal
in
its
purpose.
i
think
the
answer
may
be
found
in
that
senator
russell,
who
introduced
a
bill
in
the
senate
said
that
this
statute
was
penal
in
its
purpose
and
that
appeals
on
page
7
of
our
brief.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
among
them
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
all
i'm
making
that
statement
for
is
--
is
to
which,
upon
the
court,
which
perhaps
i
need,
the
importance
of
--
of
applying
the
rule
of
the
--
of
the
necessity
of
clear
and
unequivocal
conduct.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now,
that
the
chief
justice
asked
another
question
which
i'd
like
to
answer
him
is
this,
whether
the
1865
statute
which
dealt
with
disease
was
the
statute
which
provided
for
the
loss
of
the
united
states
citizenship.
there
was
some
suggestion
by
mr.
davis
that
that
was
the
--
either
the
effect
of
or
was
the
language
of
that
statute.
that
statute,
your
honors,
will
find
in
the
government's
brief,
the
text
of
it,
at
page
58.
it
provides
that
the
rights
of
citizenship
shall
be
deemed
forfeit
rather
than
a
provision
as
broad
and
as
soothing
as
what
is
involved
here,
namely,
that
citizenship
per
se
is
lost.
it
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
is
in
the
footnote
of
page
58
provides
that
the
right
to
hold
office
shall
be
lost.
in
other
words,
that
statute
was
intended
to
apply
to
the
laws
of
some
of
the
important
attributes
of
citizenship
rather
than
citizenship
itself.
and
finally,
what
i
am
urging
to
point,
your
honors,
with
respect
to
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
nature
of
proof
proffered
by
the
government
for
the
government
concede
the
burden
of
proof
was
upon
it
is
that
when
properly
and
fairly
upraised.
this
evidence
is
not
sufficient
to
change
the
color
of
legal
litmus
paper
and
to
permit
the
forfeiture
of
rights
of
citizenship.
the
phrase
changed
color
of
legal
litmus
papers
of
course
not
mine.
it
is
that
of
mr.
justice
holmes
but
it
replied
here.
