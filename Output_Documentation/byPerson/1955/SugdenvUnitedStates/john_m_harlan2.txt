john
m.
harlan
do
you
claim
that
the
reason
for
this
monitoring
was
to
catch
them
in
this
immigration
violation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
noticed
from
the
government's
brief
that
they
were
also
indicted
for
running
a
radio
station
without
a
license.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
this
was
a
bona
fide
monitoring
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
for
the
purpose
of
checking
up
on
the
use
of
the
license
which
i
have
understand
you
recognized
they
had
the
right
to
do
and
then
they
stumble
across
some
information
that
shows
another
crime.
you
say
they
can't
use
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
can
you
monitor
without
listening?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
then
and
really
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
while
they
have
a
right
to
monitor,
if
inadvertently
they
stumble
across
something,
they
can't
use
it.
