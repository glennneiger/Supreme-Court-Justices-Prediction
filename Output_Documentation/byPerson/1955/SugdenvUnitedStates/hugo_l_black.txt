one
is
a
public
program.
justice

black
that
was
interpreted
to
you
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
act
define
amateurs?
justice
hugo

do
you
have
that
definition
in
your

justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
the
definition
of
amateur?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
amateur
operators,
did
you
find
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
davis,
if
they
didn't
intend
to
protect
some
kind
of
privacy
and
(inaudible)
why
did
they
carefully
include
the
word
"radio"
several
different
times
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
605.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
interception
to
violate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
thought
one
provision
was
that
anyone
who
divulge
it,
even
if
they
were
lawfully
receiving
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
lawfully
receiving.
justice
hugo
l.
black
lawful
--
it's
unlawful
for
one
working
at
the
station,
have
to
transmit
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
another
station
who
receives
it
to
whatever
is
applied
both
in
radio
and
television.
justice
hugo
l.
black
receiver
or
the
transmitter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
--
what
is
the
effect
of
your
argument
that
--
here,
they
were
receiving
it
lawfully.
it
says
here,
no
person
receiving
or
assisting
in
receiving
or
transmitting
or
assisting
in
transmitting
any
and
so
forth
shall
divulge
a
public
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
see
why
the
fact
that
they
have
received
it
lawfully
wouldn't
affect
even
if
they
were
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
they
were
government
agents?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
get
them
out
of
this
then?
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
person
receiving
and
--
and
in
the
nardone
case,
(inaudible)
took
the
point
that
that
should
deprive
officers
because
they
might
want
to
expose
criminals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
receiving
it
lawfully
undoubtedly,
but
how
you
get
away
from
the
first
paragraph
of
605?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
necessarily
true
because
i
would
--
i
might
view
it
differently
if
that
was
true.
it
seems
to
me
like
the
governmental
language
(inaudible)
which
says,
"no
person,
receiving
or
assisting,
we
said
no
person,
includes
everybody,
receive
or
transmitting
or
assisting
in
transmitting,
any
other
state
or
foreign
communication
shall
divulge
or
publish
the
existence
of
contents
such
and
so
forth."
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
get
around
the
word
"divulge”.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
say
that
they
didn't
mean
all
divulgence,
but
just
some.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
under
number
one,
the
paragraph
number
one
in
--
what
difference
does
that
make
it
all
whether
it's
authorized
or
unauthorized
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
it.
you've
been
treating
it
as
though
it's
all
related
to
interception
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
intersection.
there's
another
one
that
says,
"that
no
person
who
helps
to
transmit
it
or
helps
to
receive,
however,
lawfully
i
submit,
shall
divulge
it.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
doubt
about
their
power
to
receive.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
i
get
stumped
and
parenthesized
is
on
the
first
five
lines
of
605.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
no
--
no
distinction
between
receiving
it
lawfully
and
unlawfully,
you
said
no
divulgence
after
you
receive
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'll
have
it
for
the
purpose
of
regulating?
did
have
it
for
the
purpose
of
inspecting
their
machinery
and
inspecting
what
they're
doing
to
determine
whether
they
break
their
--
cancel
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
303.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
when
you
get
beyond
there.
how
do
you
find
any
excuse
for
divulgence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
if
that
question
--
some
of
the
judge
might
have
had
some
discretion
in
connection
with
issuance
of
the
subpoena.
justice
hugo
l.
black
quite
different
under
the
first
part
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what
he
said
is
correct
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he
said
in
the
last
sentence
is
correct,
why
--
why
do
you
not
come
under
the
proviso
that
said
that
it
does
not
apply
if
it's
being
transmitted
for
the
use
of
the
general
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
is
in
the
indictment
that
refutes
it
or
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
where
do
we
get
that
information
that
this
was
not
broadcast
to
the
public,
that
it
was
a
kind
of
a
private
communication
between
the
radio
station
and
somebody
else
who
are
intended
for
their
special
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
purpose
of
giving
them
information.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
in
the
record?
