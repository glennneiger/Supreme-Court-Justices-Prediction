justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean,
for
the
use
of
the
general
public?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
is
in
the
public
domain
to
use
your
analogy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
divulging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
there
a
lot
of
--
isn't
there.
i
speak
with
the
present
monumental
ignorance
of
the
subject.
isn't
there
a
good
deal
of
radio
communication
between
officials?
it
doesn't
simply
add
to
a
lot
of
radio
communication
from
headquarters
which
officially
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
sorts
of
suggestion
--
i
suppose
all
sorts
of
communication
statute
(inaudible)
radio
network
and
their
correspondents,
their
(inaudible)
their
reporters
whatever
they
call
them,
communicators
and
(inaudible)
in
regard
to
or
rather
interest
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
go
back
to
justice
minton's
question
in
your
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
section
605
said,
"to
have
no
person
not
being
authorized
by
(inaudible)
shall
intercept
any
communication
(inaudible)
now,
no
person,
i
think,
as
far
as
the
rule
means
includes
official
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
officers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
person
not
be
authorized,
does
that
imply
to
--
must
derive
some
authority
from
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
sender
(inaudible).
now,
they
are
to
be
implied
(inaudible)
communications
commission
and
listen
--
everything
goes
over
the
radio?
from
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
anything
about
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
qualify
to
inspect
for
the
purpose
--
inspect
to
ascertain
whether
it
constructs
an
installation
operation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
include
the
--
if
this
language
that
naturally,
obviously
or
appropriately
covers
this
thing
with
a
content
of
proof,
as
i
understand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
inspection
that
authorized
to
--
to
have
only
a
particular
content
you
wanted
to
see
whether
it
has
some
other
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
use
for
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they
use
period,
use
for
what
purpose?
justice
felix
frankfurter
question
of
a
legitimate,
i
should
think
303
is
restricted
to
activities
or
conduct
or
observation
of
a
hearing
and
i
say
eavesdrop
a
hearing
for
purpose
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
get
that
out
of
whether
the
--
the
answer
to
that
can
be
derive
--
the
answer,
certainly
a
yes
--
can
be
derive
from
303.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
go
into
--
for
your
consideration,
so
you
can
answer
both
or
the
other.
i
have
mr.
black's
trouble
is
that
the
first
paragraph
of
605.
i
like
you
also
to
take
into
account
the
second
cause
and
no
person
not
being
authorized
by
the
sender
shall
intercept.
now,
i
understand,
you
follow
your
argument
with
303
and
authorized
inception
by
the
sender
here
because
that's
the
basis
on
which
he
operates
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
therefore,
no
person
not
being
authorized
by
the
sender
is
authorized
by
defendant
shall
intercept
and
divulge.
i
take
it
no
--
not
being
authorized
or
divulge
also.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
maybe
authorized
by
303,
to
both
intercept
and
divulge
for
the
purpose
of
the
303
but
where
does
it
say
they
authorize
(inaudible)
if
it's
not
under
303?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
it's
clearly
was
in
the
language
of
605.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
put
it
to
you
that
there
is.
if
you
did
not
have
605,
then
303
will
stand
by
itself
and
it
would
authorize
the
client
if
you
will,
authorized,
the
sender
will
authorized
interception
and
divulgence
if
605
is
not
in
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
put
it
to
you
that
6
--
instead
of
605
be
limited
by
303,
a
suggestion
that
303
is
limited
by
605.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
have
to
give
me
a
very
good
reason
for
--
for
not
construing
affection
of
the
statute
limiting
this
power
of
303,
a
section
that
embodies
the
policy
which
this
court
has
described
as
it
did
in
the
first
nardone
case.
you
have
to
give
me
some
very
good
overwriting,
public
reading
why
the
limitation
upon
303
by
605
should
not
be
respected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
--
before
you
go
to
that
main
(inaudible)
main
issue,
enlighten
me
on
the
question
i
put
to
mr.
wilmer
as
to
what
--
as
to
the
scope
of
the
monitoring
specifically,
i
put
to
him
this
(inaudible)
simply
just
for
the
purposes
of
argument.
i
don't
understand
any
of
this.
i'm
not
a
(inaudible)
i
don't
belong
to
the
(inaudible)
case
but
i
assume,
i
assume
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
communication
going
on
between
cbs,
nbc
american
broadcasting
company
and
their
people
all
over
the
world,
private
instruction,
tips,
suggestions,
et
cetera.
is
all
of
that
subject
to
the
monitoring
of
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
my
radio
messages
(inaudible)
are
monitored
by
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
not
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
they
wouldn't
be
kept
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
common
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
argument
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
common
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
no
comparable
section
605
so
far
as
i
know
in
the
postal
law
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
the
fourth
amendment
that
says
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
if
a
fellow
says,
“go
and
take
this
stuff,”
you're
on
illegally
seizing
or
searching.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
there
was
because
you're
quite
correcting
searching
as
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
605.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
go
beyond
constitutional
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
that
you
suggest
that
you're
arguing
(inaudible)
this
court
not
to
extend
a
rule
made
by
this
court
and
i'm
pressing
you
to
stick
close
what
congress
directed
this
court
to
obey
namely
section
605.
justice
felix
frankfurter
congress
said
that
you
shan't
intercept
or
divulge
except
with
the
consent
of
the
owner
for
purposes
of
this
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
purpose
of
this
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
have
to
say
its
dirty
business.
it
wouldn't
be
only
in
which
the
law
take
a
particular
situation
which
may
in
itself
be
as
you
quoted
on
everything
else,
that
even
for
the
public
good
and
(inaudible)
within
the
restricted
policy
laid
down
by
congress
which
follows
on
in
it's
reach
maybe
may
have
great
public
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
was
this
the
--
mr.
stratton
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
what
he
disclose
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
rely
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suspect
you
didn't
because
you
couldn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
might
argue
that
the
subpoena
(inaudible)
require
the
sanction
of
a
court
and
you
might
have
to
classify
the
court
what
was
introduced
so
that
the
congress
might
be
ready
to
have
a
(inaudible)
on
that
and
not
the
officials
themselves
exercise
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
him
to
make
that
statement.
