mr.
mark
wilmer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
substantially
three
questions,
two
of
which
are
of
substantive
law
and
one
procedural.
it
maybe
that
the
court
will
not
find
it
necessary
to
resolve
all
of
them.
the
first
question
involves
the
extent
of
the
authority
of
the
federal
communications
commission
to
monitor
communications
via
radio.
involves
the
extent
of
their
authority
and
the
purpose
for
which
they
may
monitor.
the
second
involves
the
effect
of
the
failure
of
an
operator
of
a
radio
station
to
have
a
temporary
permit,
to
have
an
operator's
permit,
which
the
circuit
court
deemed
a
perfunctory
permit,
one
which
issues
as
a
matter
of
course.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
to
the
effect
that
the
failure
to
have
such
an
operator's
permit,
freed
the
communication
from
the
protection
of
section
605
and
that
therefore
the
government
might
employ
communications
intercepted
while
the
operator's
permit
was
not,
in
effect,
at
a
federal
court
freely
and
without
limitation.
the
third
question
and
the
one
which
i
said
was
procedural
involves
the
failure,
the
effect
of
the
failure
of
the
government
to
separate
out
from
the
case
which
it
hoped
to
present
to
the
federal
court,
the
evidence
which
the
circuit
court
held
to
have
been
illegally
acquired.
in
other
words,
there
were
three
interceptions
in
this
case
by
the
federal
communications
agents.
two
of
those
interceptions
occurred
during
the
time
when
the
operator's
permit
was
not
in
effect
and
the
third
interception
occurred
after
the
operator's
permit
was
issued.
it
was
agreed
by
the
united
states
attorney
that
these
three
interceptions,
the
transcribed
recordings
of
it
were
employed
in
soliciting
witnesses,
were
employed
before
the
federal
grand
jury
which
indicted
and
were
employed
and
were
proposed
to
be
employed
in
the
trial
of
the
action
in
the
question
of
witnesses.
the
matter
arose
in
this
fashion.
the
two
defendants
or
the
two
appellants
here,
robert
sugden
and
his
wife
jean
sugden
were
indicted
in
the
federal
court
at
phoenix
from
the
charge
of
conspiracy
to
conceal
wetbacks,
to
conceal
immigrants
illegally
in
the
united
states
through
the
use
of
a
radio,
through
installing
a
radio
in
their
farm
and
employing
the
mobile
units
in
the
trucks,
to
warn
people
in
the
fields
of
the
approach
of
the
immigration
officers.
there
were
a
number
of
overt
acts
charged.
one
of
which
significantly
was
laid
on
the18th
of
september.
the
second
indictment
was
an
indictment
against
robert
sugden
alone
who
was
alleged
on
--
with
some
17
counts
of
having
illegally
concealed
wetbacks.
prior
to
the
cases
coming
on
for
trial,
we
seasonably
moved
to
suppress
all
of
the
evidence
which
was
secured
through
--
at
monitoring
the
radio
station
of
the
appellants,
of
the
petitioners
here.
the
trial
court
held
a
hearing
at
which
evidence
was
introduced
substantially
showing
the
following
facts.
the
sugdens
in
early
spring
or
summer
of
1953
contacted
the
motorola
company
which
this
court,
of
course,
knows
and
which
everyone
knows
is
an
outstanding
manufacturer
of
electronic
and
radio
equipment.
they
were
put
in
contact,
came
in
contact
with
the
representative
of
that
company
one,
(inaudible).
he
was,
to
their
knowledge
an
experienced
and
able
person,
well
versed
in
all
of
the
intricacies
of
radio
installations
and
regulation
of
which
these
two
persons
knew
nothing.
he
was
called
upon
to
install
the
system
for
them.
he
did
install
the
system
which
consisted
of
a
base
station
in
the
home,
in
the
farm
home
and
in
mobile
units
in
the
various
pickup
trucks
which
were
employed
by
petitioners
in
their
farming
business.
he
undertook
to
get
within
the
necessary
station
license
and
did
get
such
a
license.
he
also
assured
them
that
he
would
take
care
of
their
operator's
permits
and
left
them
some
forms
with
which
to
apply
for
those
permits.
the
station
was
installed
in
august
and
they
started
operating
it
along
about
that
time.
the
evidence
showed
on
the
preliminary
hearing
that
on
september
9,
the
sugdens
raid
application
for
their
operator's
permit.
this
was
sent
back
to
them
because
they
failed
to
put
a
check
mark
on
the
back
of
the
application
or
on
one
of
the
forms
in
the
application.
and
accordingly,
they
have
to
resend
it
in
and
the
permit
was
issued
september
17th.
the
testimony
on
the
hearing
was
to
the
effect
from
mrs.
sugden
that
to
her
best
recollection
they
were
ceded
on
the
17th.
mr.
stratton
who
was
the
agent
of
the
federal
communications
commission
who
did
the
monitoring
or
was
in
charge
of
it
and
testified
--
testified
that
he
examined
the
sugden
installation
on
the
18th
of
september
and
he
did
not
make
any
statement
that
the
operator's
permit
was
then
not
in
possession.
in
other
words,
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
its
reply
brief
here
would
raise
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
in
fact
the
operator's
permits
were
issued
on
the
18th
but
we
take
the
position
and
i
think
justifiably
so
that
it
was
in
effect
conceded
in
the
district
court
that
the
permits
were
issued
on
the
18th.
the
fact
that
stratton,
the
agent
went
over
the
installation,
made
a
report
and
did
not
claim
that
the
permits
were
not
in
hand
at
that
time,
seems
to
us
to
rather
or
differently
justify
the
conclusion
that
they
did
in
fact
have
the
permits
at
that
time.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor,
mr.
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
mr.
sugden
testified
that
he
recalled
when
the
station
license
came
that
there
were
some
language
with
it
to
the
effect
that
operator's
permits
had
been
obtained
or
would
be
obtained.
the
testimony
of
mr.
pilling
who
was
the
technician
in
the
sheriffs
office
at
yuma
and
who
testified
before
the
government
was
simply
to
the
effect
that
he
told
mrs.
sugden
he
couldn't
fill
out
the
completion
report
until
they
got
their
operators
permit.
mrs.
sugden
testified
that
she
did
not
know
they
were
required.
she
testified
that
they
relied
entirely
upon
mr.
bridges
to
advise
them
what
to
do.
the
testimony
was
clear
that
mr.
bridges
was
there
when
the
station
was
in
operation
and
he
made
no
effort
to
warn
them,
to
advise
them
not
to
operate
it.
and
mr.
pilling,
the
technician
from
the
sheriff's
office
while
he
initially
stated
that
he
warned
them
not
to
operate
it,
he
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
all
he
said
was
that
he
couldn't
fill
out
the
completion
reports
until
the
operator's
permits
had
arrived.
so
that,
i
think
there
is
no
question
to
what
the
operator's
permits
were
not
in
hand
until
the
17th.
i
think
there's
also
no
question
in
the
record
that
the
sugdens
were
not
warned
that
they
require
this
type
of
a
permit
and
i
think
there's
no
question
but
from
the
record
that
must
be
concluded
that
their
failure
to
get
the
permits
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
claim
of
conspiracy.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct.
the
station
--
the
permit
for
what
is
known
as
the
industrial
use,
the
application
stated
that
it
was
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
connection
with
farm
pickups
and
in
farming
operations
and
incidentally
farming
plows
which
is
rather
unusual
use
to
put
a
radio
to.
in
any
event,
it
is
true
that
the
permit
as
issued
was
a
limited
permit
and
that
it
was
intended
for
use
in
connection
with
the
farming
activities
of
petitioners
here.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
i
can
answer
that
best
by
saying
that
probably
it
had
a
relation
to
the
farming
activities.
but
if
the
government's
position
is
correct
that
this
radio
was
so
used
and
we
do
not
concede
that
for
a
moment
but
if
we
accept
from
the
face
of
the
record
as
we
must,
in
this
stage
of
the
record
anyway
because
we're
here
faced
only
with
the
indictment
which
makes
the
charge.
the
only
way
i
can
answer
that
would
be
to
say
that
it
had
no
legitimate
employment
in
connection
to
the
farming
activities
which
undoubtedly
was
used
in
connection
with
it.
now,
the
proof
show,
if
i
may
go
back
for
just
a
moment
that
the
investigation
by
the
federal
communications
commission
arose
upon
complaint
by
the
immigration
officers
in
the
area.
the
immigration
officers
apparently
complained
to
the
justice
department,
the
justice
department
in
turn
complained
to
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
commission
in
turn
sent
mr.
stratton
to
the
area.
he
testified
that
the
cause
of
his
coming
there
was
a
complaint
of
the
department
of
justice.
so
i
think
that
we
may
start
out
with
our
attempt
to
understand
this
problem
at
least
on
the
supposition
that
it
was
a
purposeful
journey
which
stratton
made
to
yuma
area
for
the
purpose
of
interception.
he
did
not
need
to
go
there
to
see
if
they
have
their
operator's
permit.
that
would
have
been
shown
by
their
own
records.
he
had
no
occasion
to
go
there
except
because
the
immigration
officials
complained
that
someone
was
using
a
radio
improperly.
and
he
went
there
to
catch
him.
that
is
the
substance
of
it
and
he
went
there
to
catch
him
by
interception
of
the
communications
by
radio.
the
evidence
is
clear
that
he
checked
in
when
he
first
got
there
with
the
immigration
officials.
and
that
he
promptly
as
he
intercepted
these
communications
reported
to
them.
and
that
by
confidential
letter
or
by
confidential
cover,
copies
of
the
transcription
went
forward
to
the
immigration
officials
promptly
after
the
interceptions.
on
the
fourth,
he
manually
took
down
the
messages
as
he
intercepted
them.
on
the
tenth
of
september,
he
returned
with
a
companion
and
with
a
recording
device
and
mechanically
recorded
the
transcriptions
which
he
made,
and
in
turn
turned
over
to
the
department
of
justice
and
to
the
immigration
service.
and
then
again
on
the
18th,
he
returned
with
the
companion
and
again
transcribed
the
interceptions
and
forwarded
them
to
the
department
of
justice
and
to
the
immigration
service.
and
on
the
18th,
for
the
first
time,
he
called
on
the
sugdens
and
went
over
their
installation
and
made
certain
comments
and
left
them
a
set
of
rules
and
regulations.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
--
the
government's
first
position
is
that
under
the
communications
act,
the
government
is
freely
permitted
to
monitor
and
hence
being
freely
permitted
to
monitor,
they
are
freely
permitted
if
they
come
upon
some
criminal
mischief
have
put
to
make
use
of
it.
they
attempt
to
present
the
case
as
if
the
sole
thing
involved
here
was
a
question
of,
can
the
federal
communications
commission
monitor?
we
make
no
complaint
--
make
no
claim
of
course
if
they
cannot
monitor.
we
do
make
the
claim
that
the
federal
communications
act
properly
read,
discloses
no
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
give
to
the
federal
communications
commission
the
authority
which
they
here
see,
which
is
in
effect
to
supervise
every
communication
by
radio
whatever
type
or
kind
of
communication
that
may
be.
now
it
is
true
that
this
is
a
particular
type
of
a
license
but
if
the
right
inheres
in
the
federal
communications
commission
to
check
these
communications,
then
the
right
inheres
in
them
to
check
all
of
it
because
the
act
makes
no
distinction
as
to
this
type
of
a
license
or
that
type
of
a
license.
so
that
initially,
we
are
faced
with
the
claim
of
the
government
that
it
has
--
of
the
federal
communications
commission
as
asserted
by
the
government
that
it
has
general
supervision
over
all
communications
by
radio.
now,
that
claim
is
made
frankly
and
boldly
in
their
brief.
they
state
that
they
are
required
because
the
radio
spectrum
is
limited
to
in
effect
allocate
to
each
user
of
it,
to
each
licensee
his
(inaudible)
part
of
the
time
and
then
in
addition
to
that
they're
entitled
to
listen
in
on
what
he
says
to
see
if
he
is,
in
fact,
saying
more
than
he
should
say.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct
but
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
first,
that
the
only
fair
implication
from
the
record
is
that
they
came
at
the
solicitation
of
the
immigration
people
in
connection
with
the
claim
immigration
violation.
secondly,
in
connection
with
their
indictment
for
not
having
operator's
license,
all
they
have
to
do
is
produce
their
own
records.
all
they
had
to
do
is
go
to
the
sugden
home,
see
the
radio
on
operation
and
look
at
their
own
records
and
they
had
a
case
there
with
respect
to
the
operator's
permit.
no
question
about
that.
so
that
it
is
true
that
there
were
filed
over
--
rather
were
returned
on
their
presently
pending
certain
indictments
for
violations
of
communications
act.
but
those,
we
respectfully
submit,
the
record
clearly
says
it
was
for
side
issues.
those
are
incidental.
those
were
simply
by-products
of
the
original
purpose
in
going
to
yuma.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor.
those
cases
were
set
for
trial
and
have
been
vacated
pending
the
determination
of
this
cause.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
that
the
communications
act
properly
and
carefully
and
fairly
read,
does
not
disclose
any
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
that
the
federal
communications
commission
was
to
become
an
adjunct
of
every
bureau
in
the
sense
of
becoming
a
law
enforcement
agency.
now
if
i
might
just
carry
that
metaphor
just
as
we
did.
the
government
has
taken
the
position
in
its
reply
brief
and
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
it
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
but,
nonetheless,
we're
perfectly
happy
to
accept
it
because
we
think
it
demonstrates
what
we're
here
to
say.
in
their
reply
brief,
they
trace
the
history
of
monitoring.
they
say
that
it
went
back
to
1920
--
1912,
i
believe
and
they
bring
it
forward
up
to
1931
with
the
construction
of
a
monitoring
system.
and
then
they
say
that
in
1931,
when
this
system
was
or
this
central
monitoring
station
was
built
that
it
become
firmly
in
trenched
as
a
part
of
the
communications
regulation
by
the
then
radio
commission.
from
that,
we
draw
in
the
conclusion
that
it
was
then
a
part
of
the
accepted
practice
that
the
commission
was
to,
was
monitored.
for
what
purposes
of
course,
we
don't
know.
if
that
is
a
case
of
the
police,
the
commission
then
returned
to
the
communications
act
and
read
it
carefully.
we
either
have
to
decide
that
congress
didn't
know
what
they
were
dong,
that
congress
was
--
was
--
saying
a
lot
of
things
that
were
completely
apart
from
the
public
interest
or
that
the
congress
didn't
know
that
they
were
doing
those
things
or
didn't
intend
that
they
should
continue
doing
them
in
the
sense
of
eavesdropping
and
tackling.
now,
the
first
provision
which
is
of
consequence
in
that
respect
is
found
in
150
--
section
154
of
title
47,
subdivision
(l).
all
reports
of
investigations
made
by
the
commission
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
no,
your
honor.
i
didn't
find
this
while
i
was
coming
(inaudible).
it
is
154
(l).
all
reports
of
investigations
made
by
the
commission
shall
be
entered
a
record
and
a
copy
there
shall
be
furnished
to
the
party
who
may
have
complained
--
to
the
party
who
may
have
complained
and
to
any
common
carrier
or
licensee
that
may
have
been
complained
off.
well,
now,
if
it
please
the
court.
if
the
congress
at
that
time
was
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
the
radio
monitoring
services
were
then
installed,
were
being
constantly
employed
about
the
country
and
list
all
sorts
of
conversations
and
becoming
aware
of
the
fact
of
all
sorts
of
criminal
conspiracies
afoot,
of
criminal
mischief
afoot,
roam
running,
dope
peddling,
dope
--
transportation.
if
they
were
aware
of
the
fact
that
that
was
being
done
and
they
intended
to
authorize
its
continuance,
wouldn't
have
been
the
reasonable
thing
that
they
would
have
also
had
those
reports
go
to
the
law
enforcement
officers?
if
they
didn't
regard,
if
the
congress
didn't
regard
that
this
monitoring
was
solely
the
physical,
mechanical
business
of
seeing
a
frequency
--
that's
a
sign
of
seeing
the
power,
was
that
a
sign
and
so
on,
why
then
in
this
particular
section
did
they
not
require
that
when
they
made
an
investigation
and
found
some
criminal
activity
afoot
that
they
should
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
proper
law
enforcement
agencies.but
they
said
nothing
of
that
sort
at
all.
if
we
go
on
through
the
act
and
turn
to
section
303,
i
believe
it
is,
which
is
the
--
the
--
section
which
deals
with
the
power
of
the
commission.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
--
a
complete
answer
is
found
to
the
contention
of
the
government.
this
is
cited
in
our
brief.
i'm
not
going
to
read
the
whole
thing
because
it
is
too
long,
i'm
going
to
turn
to
the
section
thereof
--
which
provides
that
it
shall
have
authority
to
spend
the
license
of
any
operator
upon
proofs
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
commission
that
the
licensee
then
they
set
out
certain
infractions.
a,
has
violated
any
provision
of
any
act,
treaty
or
convention
binding
on
the
united
states
which
the
united
states,
which
the
commission
has
authorized
to
administer
or
any
regulation
made
by
the
commission
under
any
such
act,
treaty
or
convention.
now
mind
you,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
the
congress
here
limited
solely
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
suspend
or
revoke
a
license
where
the
act
violated
was
one
which
the
commission
was
in
--
was
authorized
to
enforce.
if
it
had
been
the
intent
of
the
congress
that
the
commission
in
this
general
monitoring
practice
which
they
say
was
so
firmly
and
established,
if
it
had
been
the
intent
of
the
congress
that
it
was
the
power,
the
right
of
the
commission
to
listen
generally
on
all
conversations
and
having
this
been
--
and
having
intercepted
then
to
transmit
the
information
and
use
it
in
court.
why
did
the
congress
here
say
you
can
only
suspend
a
license
where
the
act
violated
is
one
“any
--
a
violation
of
any
act,
treaty
or
convention
binding
on
the
united
states
which
the
commission
is
authorized
to
administer”.
clearly
there,
the
congress
had
intended
that
the
federal
communications
commission
was
to
become
a
super
detective
agency
insofar
as
radio
is
concerned,
would
they
not
have
authorized
them
to
suspend
the
license,
license
of
any
station
which
was
used
in
an
illegal
operation?
would
they
not
there
has
said
any
statute.
but
no,
the
congress
there
carefully,
very
precisely
limited
what
statutes
the
commission
could
suspend
the
license
for
the
infraction
thereof.
they
go
on
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor.
i
--
i'll
say
very
frankly
that
that
is
the
most
troublesome
question
on
the
entire
case.
i
say
that
they
cannot
use
it
and
i
say
it
for
the
following
reasons.
the
act
does
not
contemplate
that
the
monitoring
which
we're
talking
about
here
is
to
be
that
of
a
general
listening
in
on
conversations.
the
congress
gave
in
this
authority,
gave
them
the
authority
to
inspect
installations
associated
with
radio
stations
to
check
the
--
to
see
if
they
were
properly
constructed,
properly
operated
or
properly
controlled.
the
language
isn't
just
right,
but
in
any
words,
the
congress
limited
their
authority
to
inspect
radio
installations.
now
the
government
would
take
that
language
and
blew
it
up
into
the
proposition
that
they
were
entitled
on
the
basis
of
that
to
do
anything
they
want
to
insofar
as
radio
is
concerned
but
it
is
our
position
that
when
they
say
inspect
radio
installations,
they
could
very
well
that
they
had
wanted
to
go
further
and
give
them
this
general
authority
that
we're
talking,
have
given
them
the
authority
to
inspect
communications
made
by
radio
or
to
otherwise
broaden
their
authority.
but
it
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
we
do
not
find
in
the
words,
inspect,
radio
installations.
the
general
authority
to
become
a
super
censorship
so
to
speak
or
to
create
a
super
censorship
overall
communications.
to
monitor,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
does
not
necessarily
mean,
to
listen
in
on
conversations.
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they're
to
sit
there
with
their
ears
glued
to
a
microphone
and
listen
to
what
the
people
are
saying.
monitoring
is
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
if
they're
on
the
assigned
frequency,
to
see
if
their
power
requirements
or
their
power
output
is
proper
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
to
see
if
they're
on
a
--
if
they're
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
it
please
the
court,
i
--
i
don't
claim
to
be
a
radio
expert
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
if
they
monitor
in
the
sense
of
finding
out
if
they're
on
the
proper
frequency,
they
don't
have
to
take
down
the
conversation,
they
listen
to
the
signal.
if
they
monitor
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
their
power
output,
that,
i
don't
know.
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
they're
required
to
listen
to
the
conversation
unless
as
i
have
said
before
the
government
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
is
correct.
and
i
say
that
for
this
further
reason,
your
honor.
section
605
which
is
the
section
which
of
course
is
crucial
here
which
this
court
has
passed
upon
numerous
times
in
connection
with
telephone
wire
tapping
originally
was,
of
course,
a
part
of
the
27
radio
act.
it
came
into
telephones
and
telegraphs
from
radio.
it
didn't
come
into
radio
from
telephones
and
telegraph.
this
court
recognized
that
in
one
of
the
cases
passing
on
that
--
i
forgot
in
which
one
immediately
but
the
fact
remains
that
at
the
time
when
605
was
carried
forward
by
the
congress
into
the
1934
act
that
605
was
then
left
in
its
identical
language,
as
i
understand
it,
or
substantially
so
as
it
had
been
before.
now
if
we
can
see
at
that
moment
that
the
congress
knew
that
the
monitoring
practice
widespread,
knew
that
the
people
employing
the
monitoring
were
listening
in
and
gathering
conversations
and
intended
that
they
should
use
those
conversations
in
the
sense
of
handing
them
on
to
a
federal
enforcement
agency,
they
didn't
indicate
that
in
the
statute.
the
statute,
as
the
court
well
knows,
forbids
first
interception
and
divulsions.
in
other
words
the
congress
forbad
not
interception.
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
nothing
in
605
that
says
they
can't
intercept.
no,
but
the
only
thing
that
605
prohibits
is
interception
and
divulsions.
then
to
make
doubly
sure,
the
congress
went
or
the
statute
goes
on
and
says
that
in
addition
to
the
prohibition
against
acceptance
and
divulsions,
it
also
prohibits
anyone
who
has
obtained
information
that
has
been
unlawfully
intercepted
from
divulsion.
in
other
words,
congress
first
buttoned
up
so
to
speak
and
forbad
interception
and
divulsions.
and
then
it
took
the
next
step
which
was
of
someone
acquiring
information
that
had
been
intercepted
but
not
intercepting
themselves
and
said,
“you
can't
disclose
that
either.”
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
statute
does
not
prescribe
any,
your
honor.
and
let
me
say
this
if
i
may.
i
have
always
understood
that
the
function
of
a
proviso
in
a
statute,
the
function
of
a
qualification,
so
to
speak,
was
to
eliminate
from
the
full
play
of
the
statute
some
specific
things
and
that
--
where
there
was
such
a
proviso,
the
general
construction
is
that
there's
nothing
else
accepted.
now
mind
you
when
605
was
reenacted,
we
had
all
this
monitoring
apparently
going
that
they
talk
about.
we
have
the
fact
that
they
were
listening
in
all
over
the
country
to
what
was
going
on,
and
the
congress
knew
that.
that's
the
government's
position.
now
what
did
they
accept
from
the
full
swing
of
605?
after
they
have
laid
out
this
prohibition,
these
prohibitions
rather,
they
say
provided
that
this
section
shall
not
apply
to
receiving,
divulging,
publishing,
or
utilizing
the
contents
of
any
radio
--
radio
communication,
broadcast
or
transmitted
by
amateurs
or
others
for
the
use
of
the
general
public
or
relating
to
shifts
and
distress.
now
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
assume
it
means,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
if
it's
broadcast
for
the
use
of
the
public,
in
other
words,
if
it's
broadcasted
and
intended
as
public
property
like
when
you
--
you
speak
of
a
patent
as
being
--
becoming
public
ownership.
i
think
that
is
the
understanding
and
the
meaning
of
it
and
then
they
give
us
the
one
further
exception
and
that
is
to
shifts
in
distress.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that's
correct
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
it's
--
there's
no
purpose
in
--
in
protecting
it
because
the
center
intended
that
it
should
be
divulged.
it
was
in
--
it
would
be
an
implied
consent
to
its
divulgence.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
well
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
that
is
one
argument
which
the
government
makes.
that
after
all,
he
who
broadcast
in
the
use
of
radio
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
it's
the
same
as
standing
(inaudible)
mr.
mark
wilmer
your
honor,
i'm
also
in
that
same
domain
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
understand
that
that's
undoubtedly
true
that
there
is
a
substantial
use
of
radio
shortwave
and
high
frequency
in
transmitting.
i'm
sure
that's
correct.
well,
i
have
no
firsthand
knowledge
of
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
i'm
sure
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
have
--
i
have
that
unfortunate
experience,
your
honor,
but
our
answer
to
that,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
that
there's
all
the
more
reason
because
of
the
easy
accessibility
of
interception
to
radio
to
enforce
the
sanctions
of
605.
in
other
words,
the
government,
in
effect,
argues
he
who
takes
a
radio
in
his
home
or
he
who
uses
a
radio
telephone
or
--
which
is
in
effect
what
the
radio
is
--
he
assumes
the
risk
of
the
public
picking
it
up
and
listening
to
it.
well
now,
because
it
is
easy
to
steal,
is
it
better
not
to
make
stealing
a
crime?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
is
that
because
of
the
fact
that
radio
is
so
susceptible
to
interception,
because
of
that,
it's
all
the
more
reason
for
accepting
the
full
effect,
an
impact
of
605
in
saying,
“sure
you
--
if
you
happen
to
listen
and
that's
fine,
but
you
haven't
got
any
right
to
divulge.”
and
i
say
that
regardless
of
whether
it's
easy
or
not,
the
facts
are
that
the
congress
has
prohibited
it.
the
facts
are
that
the
congress
has
said
you
shall
not
divulge
it
if
you
come
across
it
and
605
plainly
spells
that
out
--
plainly
says
there
are
two
times
when
you
can
go
behind
605
and
that
is
one
if
its
broadcast
in
the
public
domain,
secondly,
if
it's
a
shift
in
distress.
now
that's
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
was
going
to
say,
your
honor,
that
i
believe
that
it's
previously
been
--
been
answered
by
the
court.
i
know
that
i
haven't
concerned
with
it
and
i'm
quite
sure
that
either
the
first
or
second
nardone
case
is
the
one
that
--
that
passed
on
it
and,
in
effect,
answer
mr.
justice
reed's
question.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor,
that
was
in
effect,
the
view
which
the
circuit
court
could.
mr.
mark
wilmer
that
was,
in
effect,
the
view
which
the
circuit
court
took
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
during
the
two
interceptions
when
jean
sugden
does
not
have
an
operator's
permit,
that
the
government
was
free
to
intercept
and
divulge.
our
answer
to
that
is
this.
had
the
failure
on
her
part
to
have
an
operator's
permit,
played
any
part
in
the
so-called
conspiracy.
it
had
been
it
--
had
it
been
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
had
it
been
a
failure
to
obtain
a
permit
which,
in
fact,
involved
the
public
revenues
or
had
it
been
the
type
of
a
permit
which
in
some
fashion
public
policy
was
related.
there
might
be
some
basis
for
the
attitude
of
the
--
of
the
commission.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
understand
sir.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well
the
answer
in
this
fashion,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
my
opinion,
i
believe
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
would
be
my
opinion
for
it's
worth
to
the
court
that
if
the
license
--
if
the
station
was
unlicensed
as
if
there
is
one
case
that's
passed
and
this
is
the
court
probably
knows
and
that's
from
the
ninth
circuit
the
case
that's
cited
in
the
brief
here.
the
court
will
undoubtedly
recall
the
circumstances
when
the
people
in
portland,
i
believe
it
was,
decided
to
outsmart
the
bookies
and
use
the
shortwave
radio
to
get
the
results
of
the
race
and
then
they
puzzled
in
and
lay
the
bet
with
the
bookies
before
they
found
out
how
the
race
should
come
out.
it
will
result
to
a
multiple
large
sums
of
money.
they
were
caught
and
prosecuted.
in
that
case,
they
had
an
unlicensed
station
which
was
operating
on
an
unassigned
frequency,
in
fact
an
sos
frequency,
and
in
addition,
they
had
no
licenses
and
the
whole
failure
to
obtain
a
license
was
an
integral
part
of
the
--
of
the
criminal
act.
i
would
feel
under
those
circumstances
that
the
--
the
protection
of
605
would
not
apply
but
i
also
would
feel
that
where
you
have
a
bonafide
attempt
to
comply
with
the
law,
where
you
have
an
actual
license
issued
to
the
station,
where
you
have
the
station
operating
on
its
assigned
frequency
and
where
the
only
thing
they
can
complain
of
is
the
fact
that
because
this
woman
didn't
know
any
better
because
she
relied
upon
the
representative
of
a
well
known
electrical
firm
because
she
--
in
good
faith,
went
forward
and
used
the
radio
that
that
does
not
constitute
the
type
of
conduct
which
should
--
should
subject
her
to
the
loss
of
the
protection
afforded
by
this
statute,
nor
does
it
justify
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
would
deny
her
that
protection.
now
i
grant
you
that
i
have
to
back
up
a
little
bit
when
i
say
that
this
proviso
excludes
everything
that
should
be
excluded
from
605
when
i
make
that
admission.
because
manifestly,
if
i
say
that
if
it's
an
illegal
radio
on
an
illegal
frequency
under
an
illegal
operator,
probably,
it's
not
protected.
that
is
in
the
statute
either.
but
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
not
--
of
not
interpretation
of
the
statute
but
of
general
law
that
a
person
who
is
engaged
in
a
criminal
act
and
something
in
furtherance
to
that
criminal
act,
is
involved,
then
you
deny
the
protection
of
the
statute
to
it.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
definitions
are
found
in
section
153.
mr.
mark
wilmer
there's
a
definition
of
amateur
station,
your
honor,
subdivision
(q).
amateur
station
means
a
radio
station
operated
by
duly
authorized
persons,
interest
in
a
radio
technique
solely
with
a
personal
aim
and
without
pecuniary
interest.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
do
not
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
defines
amateur
station.
it
does
not
define
amateur
operator.
now
if
i
might
just
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
like
to
make
it
plain
at
the
outset
that
the
only
reference
to
monitoring
which
is
found
in
the
statute
is
that
provision
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
spend
money
to
acquire
stations
for
monitoring
purposes.
that
ends
the
reference
to
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
monitor
the
extent
of
that
authority
and
the
purposes
for
which
it
may
monitor.
now,
from
that
the
commission
draws
a
broad
power
to
supervise
all
communications.
from
that,
it
would
draw
the
broad
the
power
to
listen
in
on
every
conversation
for
any
purpose.
we
say
it
is
just
as
reasonable
because
in
that
same
statute,
which
gives
the
commission
the
authority
to
buy
stations
or
to
maintain
monitoring
stations
that
gives
them
the
authority
to
employ
lawyers
and
buy
law
books.
if
the
mere
authority
to
buy
something
means
that
it
is
to
be
used
without
limitation.
we
say
that
by
like
analogy
since
it
has
the
authority
to
buy
law
books
and
employ
lawyers,
it
can
go
into
a
business
of
running
a
court
or
it
can
go
into
a
business
of
practicing
law
because,
simply,
the
authority
to
buy
law
book
and
to
employ
a
lawyer,
there
you
have
a
physical
setup
for
a
full
blown
court.
by
like
analogy,
we
say
that
in
our
part
of
the
country
anyway
we
have
what
we
call
"junior
patrols"
who
are
at
schools
for
the
purpose
of
slowing
down
speeders
and
so
on,
they
are
--
a
nature
of
a
public
relations
matter
of
--
of
controlling
traffic.
they
are
authorized
to
use
police
whistles.
so,
we
say
that
if
the
legislature
gives
them
the
authority
to
use
the
police
whistle
by
like
analogy,
they
have
the
authority
to
become
a
complete
police
officer.
so,
it
is
our
position,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
before
--
before
such
an
abrupt
and
far
reaching
departure
should
be
read
into
the
communications
act
as
it
is
here
contended
for
the
government,
it
should
clearly
appear
in
there.
it
should
appear
that
the
congress
had
that
in
mind
to
give
them
this
general
broad
supervision
which
they
are
claiming.
and
i
say,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
you
can
read
the
communications
act
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
all
you
can
find
in
it
is
a
negativing
of
that
authority.
as
i
have
previously
demonstrated,
the
only
reports
which
they
are
supposed
to
give
a
better
investigations
are
to
the
parties
infected.
in
the
statute
which
does
for
what
purposes
they
may
revoke
a
license,
it
specifically
limits
that
authority
to
violation
of
a
act
treaty
or
convention
binding
upon
the
united
states
and
which
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
the
commission
is
authorized.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
say
this,
your
honor,
that
in
the
face
of
section
605,
it's
got
to
have
some
pretty
specific
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
oh,
i
--
i
tried
to
go
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
no
one
would
have
--
to
have
any
authority
from
congress
to
do
that.
no
one
has
to
have
any
authority
to
listen
in.
the
sole
prohibition
is
against
divulgence
and
i
assume
that
when
the
congress
drew
the
statute,
they
do
it
thoughtfully
and
carefully
and
i
assume
it
employed
words
for
a
specific
purpose
and
have
a
specific
meaning
so
that
for
the
purpose
of
monitoring
and
i
assume
that
it
is
for
the
sole
purpose
of
testing
frequencies
and
of
testing
power
and
of
ascertaining
if
there
are
unlicensed
stations
because
the
congress
specifically
forbad
to
the
commission
the
authority
to
censor,
specifically
spelled
out
that
nothing
in
the
act
should
be
construed
to
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
censor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
does,
your
honor.
no,
i
--
i
don't
believe
your
honors
that
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
--
it
has
rule
with
respect
to
federal
officers.
it
does
not
rule
with
respect
to
communications
officers,
specifically.
mr.
mark
wilmer
they're
being
authorized
by
the
sender.
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
let
me
go
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
let
me
go
further,
your
honor,
in
the
government's
brief.
it
takes
the
position
that
because
this
is
a
crowded
frequency.
now,
where
they
get
the
information
that
the
radio
(inaudible)
is
so
crowded,
i
don't
know.
i
assume
that
several
members
of
this
court
including
mr.
justice
douglas
probably
would
be
a
little
reluctant
to
believe
that
the
either
ways
around
(inaudible)
are
jammed
with
anything.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
they
take
the
position
that
because
they
say
this
is
a
crowded
frequency,
therefore
it
is
necessary
that
the
government
supervised
carefully,
not
only,
not
only
the
use
of
it
in
the
sense
of
assigning
the
frequencies,
but
apparently
they
go
further
and
say
that
they're
also
to
listen
in
to
see
if
the
communications
made
are
necessary.
in
other
words,
they
say
that
the
access
that
you
shall
keep
your
communications
to
a
minimum.
so,
i
supposed
that
the
position
of
the
government
is
correct
here,
we
will
have
the
revision
of
that
slogan
we
heard
during
the
war,
“is
this
script
necessary”
to
“is
this
speech
necessary”?
it
seems
to
be
their
feeling
that
not
only
are
they
authorized
to
listen
in
but
having
listened
in,
they're
authorized
to
punch
a
button
and
say,
"you're
talking
too
much."
well
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
know
it
is
not
unusual
for
federal
agencies
to
reach
out
and
grasp
for
power,
grasp
for
additional
employees
and
additional
authority.
but
i
say
this,
that
before
what
this
court
has
denounced
as
morally
wrong,
should
be
read
into
the
communications
act
the
right
to
intercept,
to
spy,
to
put
their
key
to
the
--
their
eye
to
the
keyhole,
there
should
be
some
clear
language
from
the
congress
in
there
which
indicates
that.
there
should
be
something
from
the
congress
here
which
shows
an
intent
that
the
federal
communications
commission
should
be
given
this
authority
to
read
--
i
mean
to
listen
in
to
every
private
communication
that
is
by
radio.
and
i
say
that
that
can't
be
found
there,
if
we
go,
if
it
please
the
court,
back
to
the
--
the
conditions
under
which
a
station
license
maybe
revoked.
as
i
have
said,
we
have
one
if
it
operate
in
violation
of
a
treaty
or
act
which
the
commission
is
authorized
to
enforce.
now,
if
the
congress
thought
that
they
were
going
to
be
listening
in
and
picking
up
a
lot
of
monkey
business
go
along
in
a
criminal
way.
certainly,
the
congress
would
have
given
the
authority
to
revoke
a
license
if
it
was
engaged
in
any
criminal
activity
and
yet
they
limit
it
specifically
to
a
specific
violation
of
a
specific
limited
type
of
statute.
they
go
on
as
failed
to
carry
out
a
lawful
order
of
the
master
or
person
lawfully
in
charge
of
the
ship,
willfully
damaged
to
a
permitted
radio
operators
to
be
damaged,
transmitted
superfluous
radio
communications
or
signals
or
communications
containing
profane
or
obscene
words,
language
or
meaning
or
has
knowingly
transmitted
volts
of
deceptive
signals,
wrong
call
letters
interfered
with
the
communications
that
attempted
to
obtain
or
obtain
and
assist
another
maintaining
a
license
by
fraud.
well
now,
this
goes
right
back
to
what
i
said
a
minute
ago,
if
it
please
the
court.
they
may
revoke
if
you
have
transmitted
a
superfluous
communication.
so,
i
suppose
that
the
federal
communications
commission
is
going
to
tell
us
that
that
gives
them
the
authority
to
listen
in
on
every
use
of
the
radio
and
decided
whether
the
communication
is
superfluous
or
not.
and
i
say
that
when
that
authority
is
granted,
you
have
indeed
opened
up
the
pandora's
box
for
the
commission
to
pry
into
the
private
affairs
and
to
set
about
the
business
of
regulating
what
everyone
is
saying
and
everyone
is
doing.
now,
if
we
turn
to
the
provisions
which
relate
to
the
revocation
of
an
operator's
license.
we
find
the
same
complete
dirt
of
any
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
that
this
--
the
commissions
had
supervised
and
in
the
sense
of
spying
and
determine
whether
in
every
instance
the
use
of
the
radio
is
lawful.
why
will
they
revoke
an
operator's
license?
fault
statements
knowingly
made
in
the
application
because
of
conditions
coming
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
which
would
want
it
in
refusing
to
grant
a
license
or
permit
on
an
original
application.
now,
that
is
the
closest
the
entire
statute
comes
to
giving
them
the
authority
to
revoke
a
license
of
an
operator
for
improper
use,
illegal
use
and
yet,
thus
it
not
see
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
it
is
--
it's
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
it
is
"any
station
license
or
construction
permit
maybe
revoked
because
of
conditions
coming
to
the
attention
of
the
commission
which
would
warrant
it
in
refusing
to
grant
a
license
or
permit
on
an
original
application."
now,
that
is
the
closest,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
you
can
search
this
whole
act
through
and
find
any
intimation
whatever
that
the
congress
regard
the
federal
communications
commission
as
another
adjunct
of
the
department
of
justice
or
as
a
potential
adjunct
or
arm
of
the
department
of
justice.
now,
certainly,
if
this
business
of
spying
as
they're
talking
about
had
been
carried
on
for
so
many
years
and
was
so
well
known
to
the
congress
and
was
so
calmly,
certainly
the
congress
in
enacting
this
statute
would
have
given
some
recognition
to
that
and
would
have
given
some
recognition
to
whether
or
not
they
can
divulge
that
information
and
yet
it
did
not
do
so.
now,
i
may
make
one
more
point.
the
language
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
what
inspection
rights
they
have
is
the
following.
have
authority
to
inspect
all
radio
instillations
associated
with
stations
required
to
be
licensed
by
any
act
or
which
are
subject
to
the
provisions
of
any
act,
treaty
or
convention
binding
on
the
united
states
to
ascertain
whether
in
the
construction,
instillation
and
operation,
they
conform
to
the
requirements
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
commission,
the
provisions
of
any
act,
the
terms
of
any
three-year
convention
binding
on
the
united
states
and
the
conditions
of
the
license
or
other
instrument
or
authorization
under
which
they
are
constructed,
installed
or
operated.
i
said
initially
that
inspect
an
installation
means
simply
that
a
physical
inspection
and
while
i
do
not
pretend
to
stand
here
as
an
expert
in
radio,
i
do
know
that
you
can
go
into
a
radio
station
and
you
can
tell
what
frequency
is
operating
on,
you
can
tell
what
power
output
it
is
using
and
you
can
tell
everything
else
that
is
required
to
conform
with
this.
mr.
mark
wilmer
in
operation,
your
honor,
i
assume
that
it
means
physical
operation.
i
have
to
read
that
into
it
because
nowhere
in
the
act
thus
the
congress
seemed
to
intend
that
the
commission
is
to
supervise
the
use
which
is
made
of
it.
it
seems
very
significant
to
me,
if
it
please
the
court,
and
i
frankly
know
no
way
to
explain
it
why
the
congress
did
not
see
fit
to
give
that
authority
that
is
here
sought
by
--
at
your
hands.
i
see
no
reason
why
the
congress
shouldn't
perhaps
had
done
so.
but
our
position
is
that
congress
did
not
do
so
and
since
the
congress
plainly
did
not
intend
to
give
it
to
them,
they
are
not
here
in
very
good
--
in
asking.
now,
the
license
which
is
involved
here
and
mind
you
now,
this
--
this
authority
is
to
inspect
to
see
if
we're
operating
pursuant
to
the
license
which
we
get.
the
government
has
quoted
the
permissible
operations,
speech
or
the
regulations.
stations
license
under
this
part
may
transmit
the
following
types
of
communications.
i'm
reading
from
page
14
of
the
government's
brief.
"any
communication
related
directly
to
the
safety
of
life
or
the
protection
property
and
communications
considered
essential
to
the
efficient
conduct
to
that
portion
of
the
enterprise
which
the
licensee
is
eligible
to
hold
a
station
license
under
this
part,
subject
to
the
condition
that
harmful
interference
is
not
cause
to
safety
communications
of
license
--
station
license
under
this
part.
in
other
words,
their
authority
to
inspect
is
spelled
out
here,
this
is
what
they
can
inspect
for
to
see
if,
one,
if
it
is
being
operated
so
that
the
condition
--
(inaudible)
condition
harmful
--
that
harmful
interference
is
caused
the
safety
communications
of
others.
now,
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes.
i'd
like
to
say
just
one
thing
in
closing.
i
believe
that
there
is
involved
here
regardless
of
your
honor's
decision
unless
you
of
course
decide
that
the
communications
commission
is
a
super
--
a
detective
agency
and
authorized
to
freely
monitor
and
freely
divulge
if
that
is
not
your
conclusion.
and
you
do
conclude
that
because
of
the
absence
of
the
operator's
license
during
the
time
of
the
first
two
interceptions,
then
we
say
that
we
complied
with
the
rule
which
this
court
laid
down
the
first
nardone
case
and
which
the
second
circuit
adopted
in
the
kaplan
case
and
that
is
this
and
incidentally
it
was
known
to
the
government
because
the
ninth
circuit
had
already
ruled
as
they
did
in
this
case.
we
clearly
showed
that
the
government
used
the
interception
which
was
made
on
the
18th
of
september
in
securing
the
indictment
that
they
used
it
in
questioning
witnesses
and
they
proposed
to
use
it
on
the
trial
of
the
case.
the
indictment
specified
that
on
the
18th
of
september,
we
did
an
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
and
therefore,
we
must
conclude
that
testimony
was
transmitted
to
the
grand
jury
which
resulted
in
that
indictment
because
otherwise
it
couldn't
have
indicted
on
that
point.
on
the
other
indictment,
a
count
was
laid
on
the
18th
of
september.
so,
clearly,
a
testimony
on
that
was
--
was
given
to
the
grand
jury
and
mr.
--
the
gentleman
from
the
fcc
who
testified
said
that
he
gave
them
a
full
account
of
what
he
done.
it
is
our
position
that
when
we
have
brought
back
to
the
trial
court's
attention,
we
had
clearly
tied
as
this
court
expressed
it,
the
taint
of
the
wrongful
evidence
to
the
government's
case
had
clearly
showed
that
it
was
embodied
in
any
part
of
the
government's
case.
the
burden
then
shifted
to
the
government
to
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
it
had
a
case
which
was
free
of
that
taint
which
demonstrated
that
it
could
go
forward
and
manifest
in
this
case,
it
couldn't
go
forward
with
the
indictment
because
they
were
tied
to
the
fact
that
they
used
the
illegally
intercepted
information
in
obtaining
the
indictment.
so,
we
say
that
if
the
interpretation
in
the
kaplan
case
of
the
language
of
this
first
nardone
case
is
accurate
that
the
trial
court
in
any
event
was
correct
because
the
government
made
no
effort
to
(inaudible)
the
good
from
the
bad,
made
no
effort
to
show
that
he
had
a
case
without
the
illegally
intercepted
information.
no
effort
to
show
that
the
indictment
was
not
the
fruit
of
the
illegally
intercepted
communication.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i'll
be
very
brief
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
--
if
it
please
the
court.
the
difficulty
i
find
with
the
last
argument
of
counsel
is
that
the
congress
hasn't
seemed
fit
to
look
at
it
that
way.
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
we
cannot
read
in
605
any
distinctions
as
between
legality
and
in
illegality.
we
cannot
read
into
it
anything
which
--
with
which
i
can
go
on
at
least
to
the
effect
that
congress
intended
various
practical
considerations
to
weigh
in
whether
605
will
apply
or
not.
the
languages
there,
is
unequivocal
and
it's
clear.
now,
i'd
like
to
suggest
one
other
thing
in
response
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
wilmer
well,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
wilmer
i
can't
agree
with
that.
mr.
mark
wilmer
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
well,
the
--
the
indictment
is
to
the
effect
that
they
were
using
this
between
their
home
and
the
pickup
trucks.
now,
all
radio
communications
are
--
are
general
in
the
sense
that
if
someone
wants
to
listen
in
they
can
get
in
on
it
but
there
is
no
turning
of
it
to
the
public
domain
in
the
sense
that
that
implies.
all
radio
communications
as
i
understand
it,
if
someone
wants
to
--
to
buy
the
right
kind
of
equipment,
they
can
listen
in
on
it
but
the
thing
that's
in
the
public
domain
is
where
it
is
broadcast
for
the
public.
this
isn't
broadcast
for
the
public.
this
is
broadcast
--
mr.
mark
wilmer
the
testimony
of
the
--
of
the
two
sugdens,
your
honor.
they
testified
the
--
that
the
sending
station
was
in
the
farm
home.
the
wife
operated
in
connection
with
their
household
duties.
the
trucks
are
out
in
the
field
and
they
talk
back
and
forth
between
the
private
station
in
the
house
and
the
--
the
truck
in
the
field.
mr.
mark
wilmer
of
--
of
business
communication.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
mr.
mark
wilmer
no.
there
is
nothing
to
imply,
your
honor,
that
this
was
intended
to
the
public
--
for
the
public.
and
i
say,
and
again,
as
i
said
before,
that
just
because
stealing
is
easy,
doesn't
dignified
or
justified
and
just
because
it's
easy
to
intercept
doesn't
justify
interception.
that
--
that
seems
to
be
counsel's
argument
that
because
this
is
so
easy
for
people
to
listen
to
therefore,
605
should
be
repealed.
but
i
say
that
because
it
is
so
easy
to,
605
should
be
dignified.
605
should
be
enforced
because
that's
the
only
way
we
can
keep
people
from
listening
in
and
tackling.
now,
one
other
thing.
counsel
has
said
that
because
of
the
illegal
purpose,
the
protection
605
should
be
stripped
from
this
act.
well,
suppose
the
sugdens
are
tried
and
suppose
this
evidence
is
introduced
in
evidence
and
the
sugdens
are
--
are
acquitted.
what
is
the
answer
there?
you
can't
permit
agents
of
the
federal
communications
commission
to
themselves
decide
a
man
is
guilty,
try
him
in
their
own
mind
and
say
he's
guilty.
therefore,
we
will
intercept
and
paddle
and
justify
doing
it
by
their
test
because
as
i
have
said
supposing
that
the
testimony
is
admitted.
they
have
attempted
to
do
it
and
the
jury
acquits
them
and
they're
then
found
not
guilty
and
the
crime
wasn't
committed
and
yet
the
interception
has
been
held
and
illegally.
