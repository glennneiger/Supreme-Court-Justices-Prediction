mr.
attorney
general
if
the
court
please.
in
a
rather
restrained
way,
mr.
wilmer
is
used
to
volley
unpleasant
language
about
the
actions
of
the
federal
communications
engineer,
morally
wrong
eavesdropping
either
the
keyhole.
this
is
a
kind
of
language
which
has
been
used
with
respect
to
wire
tapping
and
i
think
it
is
rather
important,
right
at
the
beginning
of
this
case,
that
we
make
it
clear
that
this
is
not
a
wire
tapping
situation.
the
--
the
petitioners
were
sending
out
messages
from
their
antenna
like
spokes
from
the
hub
of
a
wheel
that
extended
70
miles
in
each
direction.
they
were
operating
on
a
frequency
which
had
been
--
which
they
were
authorized
to
use
by
the
federal
--
federal
communications
commission
as
being
in
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity
and
they
were
subject
to
the
regulation
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
be
left
alone.
they
were
required
to
be
regulated.
they
did
not
have
privacy.
they
were
shouting
from
their
rooftops.
now,
the
reason
that
i
--
the
reason
that
i
emphasize
this
is
that
seems
to
me
important
that
we
should
realize
that
this
is
not
a
case
like
the
illegal
searches
and
seizures
cases
like
the
wire
tapping
cases.
this
is
not
a
case
of
invasion
of
privacy.
and
i
say
that
because
i
would
like
to
argue
this
case
against
mr.
wilmer
and
not
to
have
to
argue
against
mr.
justice
brandeis
and
mr.
justice
holmes.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
easier
to
take
this
case
in
its
own
setting
than
to
take
it
in
the
setting
in
which
mr.
wilmer
is
trying
to
put
it.
now,
i
must
also
note
a
--
a
slight
disagreement
with
mr.
wilmer
with
respect
to
the
facts
as
to
the
purpose
which
the
record
shows
was
being
followed
by
the
engineer
in
undertaking
this
monitoring.
now,
i
agree
with
him
that
the
engineer
went
from
los
angeles
to
--
to
arizona
for
the
specific
purpose
of
monitoring
the
--
the
transmission
of
this
station.
but
he
testified
in
this
very
case
that
his
purpose
was
to
discover
whether
or
not
radio
facilities
were
being
used
for
an
unauthorized
purpose.
i
read
those
words
from
page
35
of
the
record
where
mr.
stratton
was
testifying.
the
reason
i
--
the
reason
i
emphasized
that
is
that
whether
or
not
it
is
essential
to
this
case,
i
do
not
know,
but
i
think
that
the
case
is
easier
if
we
understand
that
here,
the
engineer
was
carrying
out
federal
communications
commission
purposes.
that's
what
he
was
doing.
there
is
no
dispute
that
his
--
his
testimony
wasn't
shaken
in
anyway
in
--
in
the
course
of
the
hearing
and
in
fact,
it
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
itself
instituted
administrative
proceedings
which
led
to
the
surrender
of
the
station
license
and
operate
its
permits
on
the
basis
of
the
things
which
mr.
stratton
heard
and
also
that
there
are
these
indictments
for
violations
of
the
communications
act
itself.
so,
it
seems
clear
that
we
do
not
have
the
communications
commission
being
used
as
a
cat's
paw
by
somebody
else.
we
have
a
situation
where
they
were
carrying
out
their
authorized
duties
and
in
the
course
of
that,
came
across
evidence
which
was
--
which
showed
a
violation
of
another
criminal
act.
before
i
get
to
the
law
and
i
also
like
to
mention
a
word
about
the
nature
--
the
nature
of
this
station
license.
this
was
called
a
special
industrial
service
station.
it
was
a
license
to
be
used
in
connection
with
the
sugden's
farm
operations.
they
operated
a
cotton
farm
in
arizona.
now,
not
only
where
they
license
under
a
law
which
imposes
regulations
including
the
right
of
inspection,
so
that
one
might
say
that
they
consented,
if
you
please,
to
inspection
but
also,
they
were
operating
on
what
is
known
as
a
"shared
frequency."
industrial
--
industrial
stations
do
not
have
any
exclusive
right
to
the
frequency
which
they
use
in
their
operation.
other
industrial
stations
in
the
same
area
and
which
would
interfere
with,
actually
with
their
--
with
their
operations
are
authorized
to
use
precisely
the
same
frequency.
there's
a
common
experience
in
riding
in
--
in
taxicabs
which
have
radio
facilities
to
hear
communications
coming
in
on
the
--
on
the
taxicab
radio,
not
only
from
the
cab's
own
station
but
from
other
stations
which
are
sending
messages
to
other
cabs
because
they,
like
the
industrial
stations,
share
the
use
of
a
frequency.
and
the
reason
i
--
the
reason
i
press
this
is
that
it
seems
obvious
that
the
sugdens
must
have
known,
they
could
not
help
but
know,
not
only
that
their
messages
were
subject
to
being
heard
by
federal
communications
monitors
but
they
were
subject
to
being
heard
by
other
industrial
users
who
are
using
the
same
--
the
same
frequency
as
they
were.
they
were
in
effect
talking
on
--
on
a
party
line,
on
vast
party
line
with
any
number
of
people
listening
in.
and
the
question
is
whether
in
a
situation
like
this
when
--
when
one
of
the
persons
listening
in
was
a
federal
communication's
officer
authorized
to
monitor
whether
he
may
lawfully
turn
the
information
over
to
other
authorities
for
use
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
the
first
issue
in
this
case
is
really
whether
or
not
congress
authorized
the
commission
to
monitor
and
this,
i
submit,
is
purely
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
there
is
no
question
here
of
an
illegal
searches
and
seizures
whether
the
olmstead
decision
is
right
or
wrong,
i
take
it
that
no
one
could
doubt
that
congress
could
if
it
decide
in
the
course
of
it's
regulatory
authority
conditioned
the
grant
of
radio
facilities
on
the
condition
that
they
be
subjected
to
monitoring.
and
the
question
--
and
that
that
wouldn't
involve
any
fourth
--
fourth
amendment
question,
the
question
is
did
congress
in
this
case
authorized
the
monitoring?
we
find
the
authority
in
section
303
of
the
communications
act,
which
we
have
printed
at
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
we
find
it
in
the
power
to
inspect
radio
facilities.
to
us
it
seems
clear
that
to
inspect
radio
facilities,
one
should
use
his
ear
as
well
as
his
eye.
inspectors
of
wine
probably
use
the
sense
of
taste.
inspectors
of
perfume
would
use
the
sense
of
smell.
inspectors
of
--
of
radio
in
order
to
know
what
is
going
on
must
use
the
sense
of
hearing
and
therefore
we
would
read
the
--
the
term
inspection,
the
right
to
inspect
is
giving
them
the
right
to
listen
to
as
well
as
the
right
to
look
at.
mr.
attorney
general
an
operation.
and
here
if
we
would
want
to
refer
to
this
particular
case,
the
question
is
whether
the
operation
is
a
authorized
operation.
mr.
attorney
general
if
--
if
the
regulations
dealing
with
operations,
lawful
operations
deal
with
the
content
of
the
messages,
then
i
would
think
that
the
inspection
power
to
--
to
enforce
that
regulation
would
necessarily
also
cover
the
content.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
for
example
in
this
particular
case
with
a
shared
frequency,
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
in
(inaudible)
arizona
or
not
but
where
you
have
fret
--
shared
frequency
and
if
they
are
not
using
it
for
an
industrial
purpose
but
are
actually
using
it
for
communications
purpose,
for
an
entertainment
purpose
or
something
like
that,
they
are
taking
a
part
of
the
spectrum
from
the
other
industrial
users
which
they
shouldn't
take
and
the
commission
is
in
a
position
to
monitor
to
find
out
whether
they
are
doing
what
they
have
been
authorized
to
do.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
i
think
that
--
no
--
mr.
attorney
general
no.
the
power
of
their
station
was
such
that
it
--
the
engineer
said
that
it
would
give
good
reception
for
70
miles.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that
and
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
they
shouldn't
be
broadcasting
for
70
miles.
mr.
attorney
general
actually,
it
may
--
make
clear
the
federal
power
a
little
--
a
little
because
it
carried
the
messages
over
state
line
into
--
into
california
and
over
the
federal
line
into
mexico
and
the
--
the
signals
actually
carried
that
far.
they
also
has
a
great
bearing,
it
seems
to
me,
on
the
extent
of
privacy
which
they
could
have
expect
to
have
in
the
course
of
speaking
over
this
because
it
covers
a
--
a
huge
area.
it's
not
something
which
they
would
think
would
be
heard
only
on
their
farm.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
605,
does
apply
to
radio,
mr.
justice
black.
i
think
that
there
are
many
uses
of
radio
and
although
it
is
not
before
this
court
that
there
might
be
many
interceptions
which
would
violate
605.
many
--
mr.
attorney
general
there
has
to
be
an
interception
and
a
divulgence.
yes,
it's
in
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
it
were
--
if
it
will
illegally
--
well,
if
a
station
employee
divulges,
that's
true
or
if
there
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
if
--
if
a
station
employee
divulges
information
which
he
lawfully
receives
in
--in
communication.
that
is
unlawful
under
605.
mr.
attorney
general
to
divulge
it
to
an
unauthorized
person,
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
not
sure
--
sure
i
understand
your
question
but
in
order
to
protect
the
lines
of
communication,
they
say
that
if
for
example
as
in
telegraph
if
the
--
if
the
receiver
takes
and
uses
information
and
gives
it
to
someone,
he
shouldn't.
that
is
a
violation
of
605.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
in
other
words,
there
is
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
is
privacy
to
some
messages
which
are
sent
over
the
radio.
mr.
attorney
general
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
would
affect
their
divulgence?
mr.
attorney
general
well,
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
authority
of
--
for
the
commission,
and
again
at
the
moment
i
am
speaking
only
of
the
commissions
monitoring
activities,
to
receive
--
to
inspect
must
mean
that
they
can
monitor
and
they
can
use
that
information,
they
can
divulge
it.
otherwise,
the
monitoring
is
of
no
effect,
it
would
be
--
mr.
attorney
general
well
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
but
not
federal
communications
officers
who
are
authorized
under
303
to
do
this.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
think
they're
not
only
receiving
it
but
they
are
using
it
lawfully.
i
think
that
we
have
to
read
303
and
605
together.
we
have
to
determine
first
whether
the
congress
meant
that
federal
communication
engineers
could
monitor
and
use
what
they
monitor.
if
they
couldn't
--
if
they
couldn't
use
it,
there'd
be
no
--
if
they
couldn't
divulge
it,
there'd
really
be
no
sense
in
--
in
listening.
mr.
attorney
general
use
--
mr.
attorney
general
all
right.
and
i
admit
that
they
must
use
it
for
a
legitimate
purpose
and
that's
the
second
question
whether
this
is
a
legitimate
purpose.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
that
is
right.
i
think
that's
what's
they
have
--
can
inspect
for.
and
i
question
to
jump
to
the
next
point
is,
is
whether
when
they
have
inspected
legally
been
there,
if
assuming
legal
monitoring,
legal
right
to
--
to
hear
and
use
for
commission
purposes.
if
they
get
information
which
leads
to
something
else
must
--
can
they
use
that
or
are
they
forbidden
to
use
it.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
the
yes
answer
must
be
derived
from
the
policies
of
this
court
as
to
whether
they
will
forbid
using
evidence
of
--
of
information
which
comes
to
somebody
in
a
lawful
manner.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
i
do
--
i
do,
your
honor.
now,
as
to
what
you
--
mr.
attorney
general
in
the
first
place,
what
you
--
you
have
not
held
anything
with
respect
to
people
authorized
under
303
because
in
--
none
of
the
cases
which
have
come
before
this
court
have
we
had
an
authorized
monitoring
operation.
they
have
all
been
wire
tapping
operations.
now,
the
question
--
mr.
attorney
general
because
one
--
if
one
has
to
construe
605
by
itself,
we
must
find
an
unauthorized
interception
plus,
if
you
please,
a
then
authorized
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
attorney
general
and
an
unauthorized
divulgence.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
let
--
let
me
call
your
attention,
if
i
may,
to
the
--
to
the
goldman
case
where
you
didn't
--
where
--
where
you
have
clearly
the
question
of
divulgence
because
they
didn't
intercept
in
that
case,
they
heard
--
well,
there
was
a
dissent
in
the
case
but
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
that
they
heard
this
message
before
it
went
on
the
line.
now,
they
undoubtedly
divulge
a
message
which
was
sent
on
a
line
but
there
was
no
--
according
to
the
holding
of
the
court
there
was
no
illegal
interception.
the
same
thing
would
be
true
if
they
picked
up
a
message
after
it
had
been
received
at
the
end.
the
--
the
divulgence
by
itself
is
not
illegal
under
the
--
under
the
communication
act.
they're
interested
in
protecting
--
605
is
interested
in
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
radio
service
and
unless
there'd
be
an
interference
with
the
--
with
the
sending,
with
the
--
with
the
transmission
plus
a
divulgence
because
they
have
to
protect
against
innocent
listening
in.
then
there
is
no
violation
of
605
and
we
--
we
believe
that
when
you
read
303
and
605
together,
there's
an
indication
that
the
commission
intended
that
monitors,
should
listen
and
divulge
and
use
information
which
was
necessary
for
the
regulation
of
the
radio
--
of
the
radio
field.
and
our
question
here
really
is
whether
they
can
use
it
for
something
other
than
the
radio
field.
and
that's
the
--
i
think
the
--
the
--
real
question
before
the
court
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
let
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
they
aren't
receiving
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
and
if
you
read
that
by
itself,
it
is
of
course
subject
to
your
construction
but
is
it
--
can
it
be
conceived
that
monitors
--
forgetting
for
a
minute
the
immigration
laws
and
the
other
violations,
can
it
be
conceived
that
congress
meant
that
they
should
inspect
by
listening
but
should
hug
the
information
to
themselves
and
not
use
it.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
because
there
can
no
enforcement
--
no
regulation
of
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
that
would
be
divulgence.
i
mean
they
have
to
use
it.
it
cannot
stay
in
the
mind
of
the
person
who
hears
it.
he
must
use
it.
there
is
no
sense
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
that
--
that
is
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
that
he
can
use
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
right.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
the
--
the
sender
does
not
authorize
and
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
if
--
for
the
purposes
of
303
if
--
if
for
minute
we
--
we
think
of
303
there,
i
think
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
authority
to
--
to
listen
and
to
divulge,
if
you
please,
because
there
is
no
sense
in
listening
if
you
don't
divulge
for
the
purposes
of
inspection
and
that
must
be
read
then,
303
read
in
connection
with
605
must
mean
there
is
a
limitation.
now,
our
question
is,
whether
605
shall
now
be
read
to
mean
that
for
purposes
of
introduction
in
evidence
used
in
--
in
the
kind
of
situation
you
have
in
the
weeks
case,
the
boyd
case,
the
nardone
case
and
the
weiss
case
whether
you
going
to
have
a
rule
of
a
court
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
act
which
forbids
the
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
that
is
a
possible
--
it
certainly
a
--
a
possible
and
--
and
maybe
a
literal
interpretation
of
the
statute.
but
i
--
but
i
believe
that
since
--
mr.
attorney
general
well,
that
--
that
i
--
that
i
hope
to
do.
mr.
attorney
general
i
(voice
overlap)
that
is
the
task
but
i
--
i
also
believe
that
once
you
have
got
over
the
idea
that
federal
communications
commission
officers
for
proper
purposes
are
authorized
to
hear
and
divulge
and
read
that
in
connection
with
605
that
we
are
not
necessary
bound
by
the
view
that
605
prohibits
it.
i
think
when
you
read
them
together,
one
must
assume
that
there
is
an
authority
to
hear
and
divulge
for
a
proper
purpose
and
the
question
is
whether
this
is
a
proper
purpose.
mr.
attorney
general
i
believe
it
is.
the
broadcast
services
of
course
and
the
--
the
broadcast
service
and
the
auxiliary
pickup
service
that
comes
with
the
broadcast
service
is
by
invitation
opened
everyone
to
hear
that
they're
in
the
business
of
it
to
be
heard.
now,
in
--
there
is,
however,
a
great
deal
of
radio
point-to-point
communication
which
is
the
same
as
telephone
communication.
it's
not
only
the
radio,
the
broadcasters
that
used
it.
(inaudible)
telephones
--
the
american
telephone
system
has
licenses
of
point-to-point
communication
from
here
to
there.
it's
a
public
carrier
service
where
private
messages
which
are
in
entitled
to
privacy
are
sent.
now,
it
is
--
it
is
our
view
that
the
monitoring
authority
of
the
commission
extends
to
monitoring
for
the
purpose
--
for
proper
use
all
radio
facilities.
mr.
attorney
general
we
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
know
that
they
are
(voice
overlap)
monitored
by
the
commission
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
but
there
is
no
limitation
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
attorney
general
now,
that
does
not
mean
that
i
assert
that
those
can
be
divulged
for
any
purpose.
i
am
not
arguing
that
there
can
be
a
divulgence
of
--
of
that
kind
of
information.
i
think
that's
a
very
different
thing
than
we
have
in
this
--
in
this
--
in
the
case.
mr.
attorney
general
i
--
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
carry
out
their
duties
to
see
that
this
--
these
stations
are
operating
on
the
frequencies
with
the
power
and
preventing
interference,
giving
the
call
letters,
actually
operating
as
common
carriers
rather
than
operating
as
--
as
--
for
the
benefit
of
the
owners.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
do
that
without
listening.
mr.
attorney
general
and
that
--
that
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
i
may
--
if
i
may
say
an
attribute
of
the
fact
that
the
spectrum
is
limited
and
it
must
be
subject
to
this
kind
of
inspection
if
we're
going
to
see
that
it
is
used.
it
is
in
fact
used
in
a
way
which
the
--
the
licenses
of
--
of
intent.
the
right
of
inspection
here
is
not
entirely
different
although
it's
listening
to
what
goes
on
from
the
right
of
inspection
in
any
regulated
industry,
railroads,
securities
and
exchange
commission
they
had
--
they
must
investigate,
they
must
find
out
what
is
going
on.
now,
they
make
any
proper
use
of
what
they
find
out
and
if
they
do
make
an
improper
use
of
what
they
find
out
they
should
be
punished
but
that
does
not
--
shouldn't
limit
their
power
to
--
to
carry
out
this
statutory
authority
to
regulate
the
--
the
transmission
of
radio
messages.
mr.
attorney
general
the
monitoring
was
to
regulate
their
--
mr.
attorney
general
no.
the
communications
commission
isn't
doing
it.
the
question
here
is
on
admission
in
evidence
of
this
information.
this
is
a
situation
as
we
see
it,
where
in
the
course
of
legal
and
authorized
and
in
fact
required
operations,
they
came
across,
they
happened
upon
information
of
another
criminal
act.
maybe
an
analogy
would
help.
the
--
this
court
has
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
mail
matter
which
is
a
matter
deposited
in
the
mails,
it's
in
re
jackson,
i
think,
96
united
states.
and
they
say
that
that
cannot
be
search
without
--
without
impairing
the
--
the
fourth
amendment
but
they
also
say
that
if
material
is
sent
unopened
--
opened
for
inspection
that
then
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply.
let
us
assume
this
situation,
let's
assume
that
a
package
is
mailed
third
class
with
a
sign
on
the
front
of
it,
post
master.
this
maybe
opened
for
inspection,
postal
employee
opens
it
for
inspection,
lo
and
behold,
inside
he
finds
handwritten
material.
now,
third
class
matter
doesn't
conclude
handwritten
material.
you
can
only
send
merchandise
and
--
and
--
so,
here
is
a
violation
of
postal
law.
the
man
looks
at
it
and
he
sees
that
this
handwritten
material
constitutes
a
threat
against
the
life
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
now,
this
a
postal
employee.
i
think
that
no
one
could
doubt
that
he
would
not
only
have
the
authority
but
the
duty
to
turnover
that
information
to
the
department
of
justice
and
the
treasury
agents
in
order
to
protect
the
right
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
attorney
general
we
have
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
attorney
general
make
an
illegal
--
mr.
attorney
general
and
if
the
operator
of
a
radio
station
who
takes
it
subject
to
the
right
of
someone
to
listen
to
him
sends
it
out
to
him
to
listen
to
it,
then
there
is
not
any
illegal
seizure
either.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
and
also,
if
he
sends
it
out
--
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
and
the
question
is,
are
you
going
to
buy
from
--
from
using
evidence,
information
which
these
men
legally
hear
and
which
constitutes
a
violation
of
law?
are
we
going
to
--
are
we
going
to
press
further
this
exclusion
rule
which
is
a
court
rule
because
neither
the
communications
act
nor
the
fourth
amendment
says
that
you
shall
not
introduce
this
in
--
in
evidence.
that
is
a
--
a
rule
of
this
court
with
--
in
order
to
give
body
to
these
things.
are
we
going
to
carry
out
a
step
further
and
say
that
when
communications
engineers
who
are
not
sneaking
around
with
--
with
gumshoes
and
listening
in
with
--
with
no
right.
when
they
--
in
the
course
of
their
official
duties
received
and
cannot
help
but
receive
information
as
to
a
criminal
act,
are
we
going
to
deny
the
use
of
that
information
in
evidence?
the
--
the
cases
which
deal
with
this
--
mr.
attorney
general
but
congress
in
605,
your
honor,
did
not
say
that
this
material
should
not
be
used
in
evidence.
mr.
attorney
general
but
did
not
say
that
the
information
received
should
not
be
received.
mr.
attorney
general
and
did
say
--
mr.
attorney
general
and
did
say
that
people
should
listen
to
this
material.
now,
the
question
is
where
the
perfectly
honorable
people,
people
who
are
not
--
not
wiretapping,
not
sneaking
in
the
dark
of
night
but
who
are
carrying
out
a
proper
function
and
who
happened
upon
--
happened
upon
information
as
to
a
federal
crime.
in
this
case,
a
violation
of
the
immigration
law
whether
that
should
not
be
divulged,
should
not
be
used
in
evidence
in
a
court,
whether
this
court
is
going
to
say
that
that
is
the
kind
of
dirty
business
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
but
let
--
let
us
look
for
a
minute
the
cases
that
we
--
if
--
on
--
on
this
kind
of
thing.
let
us
consider
the
--
the
cases
where
evidence
has
been
denied
admission.
we
get
first
the
--
the
weeks
case
and
the
boyd
case
where
there
are
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
and
where
this
court
said,
“because
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
we
will
not
permit
this
to
be
used
in
evidence,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
ordinarily
we
do
not
consider
how
evidence
was
obtained."
then,
let's
us
consider
the
wiretapping
cases
where
the
nardone
case
and
the
weiss
case
where
they
said,
“this
is
an
illegal
interception.
these
people
were
doing
wrong
when
they
--
when
they
overheard
this
and
we
are
not
going
to
let
the
united
states
adopt,
endorse,
take
the
advantage
of
this
wrongdoing
that
they
are
doing.
so,
we
are
not
going
to
let
them
use
it
in
evidence.”
now,
those
are
cases
where
either
in
order
to
discourage
it
by
making
it
unprofitable
or
because
they
didn't
want
to
--
didn't
feel
the
united
states
should
endorse
a
wrong,
they
--
they
use
this
rule.
that
is
not
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here.
this
is
more
like
what
is
called
--
say
the
--
the
zap
case
or
the
harris
case
where
you
have
a
legal
search.
you
have
a
search
warrant
and
you're
going
after
a
particular
article
and
what?
and
you
have
no
right
to
seize
anything
else.
you've
got
a
search
warrant
or
seizure
warrant
for
a
particular
thing.
if
you
are
there
and
you
find
lying
on
the
desk
some
article
which
is
--
which
is
seizable,
the
cases,
the
zap
case,
the
harris
case
stand
for
the
ground
that
that
can
be
seized
and
used
in
evidence
and
there
you
even
have
a
fourth
amendment
case
and
a
seizure
of
the
(inaudible)
case
where
there
was
a
--
a
listening
but
there
was
no
illegal
listening
and
the
court
held
that
that
could
be
used
or
the
goldman
case
where
the
man
standing
outside
the
room,
listening
with
a
--
with
a
device
on
the
wall,
listening
to
what
was
going
on
in
the
wall.
again,
you
have
no
illegal
act
by
these
people
which
needs
to
--
the
sanction
of
the
court
in
other
for
enforcement.
as
we
see
it,
your
honor,
this
case
falls
in
--
in
that
line
of
cases
where
in
the
course
of
a
perfectly
legal
and
indeed
authorized
and
required
operation,
one
comes
cross
in
illegal
activity.
there
is
no
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
introduced
in
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
well
that,
i
believe,
is
what
they
were
doing
in
this
case
when
they
came
across
this
evidence.
mr.
attorney
general
they
believe
--
mr.
attorney
general
no.
the
act
which
that
--
that
this
is
in
--
that
this
evidence
is
used
is
illegal
concealment
of
aliens
who
are
improperly
in
the
united
states.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
doubt
it.
i
think
that
the
operations
if
they
were
monitoring
for
were
the
--
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
commission
whether
the
--
whether
the
radio
was
operating
as
authorized.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
right.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
you
honor,
i
haven't
considered
the
provisions
of
any
act.
it
sounds
as
though
that
gave
them
power
to
inspect
for
whether
their
operations
were
conforming
to
the
--
to
any
act
and
that
may
be
direct
authority
where
the
--
whether
they're
conforming
to
the
immigration
act
as
far
as
that
could
go.
and
in
this
case,
the
particular
broadcast
was
not
only
five
people
who
were
in
the
course
of
violation.
the
particular
broadcast
was
itself,
an
integral
part
of
the
violation.
in
other
words,
it's
not
as
though
a
radio
station
which
maybe
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
--
is
broadcasting.
this
case
to
be
broadcast
which
was
intercepted
was
itself
a
act
in
violation
of
the
--
of
the
immigration
laws
and
--
mr.
attorney
general
mr.
stratton
was
the
engineer.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
no,
he
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
don't
rely
on
the
subpoena,
no.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
i
don't
rely
that.
mr.
attorney
general
no.
what
--
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
if
it
was
subpoenaed
that
there
would
be
a
separate
question
in
--
in
that
--
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
although,
under
the
nardone
case
and
the
other
cases
unless
--
unless
this
is
authorized
that
was
use
made
of
it
in
connection
with
the
preparation
of
the
case
and
the
grand
jury
indictments,
so
that
the
--
the
--
if
this
is
wrong,
the
--
there
was
a
wider
--
a
wider
input
has
been
--
it
could
be
cured
by
just
using
a
subpoena.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
they
could
have
been
limited
to
a
subpoena
situation.
now,
i
want
to
turn
to
the
--
to
the
last
point
and
that
is
the
point
on
which
the
court
below
went.
the
court
below
said,
even
though
radio
communications
may
not
be
--
that
the
--
the
monitoring
of
radio
communications
may
not
be
used
except
for
purposes
of
the
commission.
they
said
in
this
case,
"we
do
not
have
the
type
of
communication
which
deserves
protection,"
and
the
court
below
said,
"that
it
didn't
deserve
protection
because
there
was
not
a
license
operator
which
is
admitted
by
counsel
for
petitioners,"
at
least
with
respect
to
the
interception
on
the
first
three
days.
on
the
fourth
day,
the
operator
was
licensed
and
the
court
below
said,
"it's
necessary
to
separate
the
evidence
which
came
in
on
the
first
three
days
of
monitoring
and
the
evidence
which
came
in
on
the
fourth
day
of
monitoring."
they
sent
it
back
to
the
court
below
to
do
that.
we
think
the
court
was
right
in
saying
that
whatever
protection
is
given
by
605
with
respect
to
the
communications.
it
cannot
be
thought
to
apply
to
a
communication
which
is
itself
violative
of
the
commissions
own
authority
because
the
very
purpose
of
605
is
to
preserve
this
valuable
right
to
give
its
dignity
and
there
is
no
dignity
in
an
illegal
transmission.
but
we
think
the
court
below
didn't
go
as
far
as
it
could
in
this
respect
because
the
broadcast
--
the
--
the
transmissions
of
this
radio
station
were
unauthorized,
not
solely
because
these
people
didn't
have
an
operator's
permit,
but
even
more
so
because
they
were
not
using
it
for
the
limited
purpose
for
which
it
was
authorized.
it
was
authorized
for
the
use
of
farming
purposes
and
these
people
were
using
it
in
order
to
conceal
--
now,
in
--
in
here
i
say
a
word
of
caution,
i
don't
know
the
facts,
but
according
to
the
indictment
and
if
--
if
it's
proved.
but
according
to
the
indictment,
they
were
using
this
radio
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
aliens
which
were
illegally
in
the
country.
it's
not
an
unusual
thing
in
the
law
when
a
--
a
privilege
is
given
to
some
relationship
for
that
privilege
to
be
stripped
away
when
the
relationship
is
abused.
perhaps,
the
classic
example
of
it
is
the
attorney-client
privilege
which
is
a
privilege
which
we
all
treasure
highly.
but
from
the
beginning,
it
has
been
denied
to
those
who
would
use
the
attorney-client
privilege
to
cloak
a
crime
or
to
cloak
fraud,
fraud
itself.
if
the
courts
will
strip
from
--
from
that
privilege,
that
privilege
away
from
attorney-client
and
much
lesser
thing
to
feel
that
when
the
valuable
airways
which
are
limited
in
use,
which
are
crowded,
by
and
large
they're
crowded.
if
that
is
not
only
used
not
for
the
purpose
which
it
is
designed
but
used
in
order
to
violate
a
law
of
the
united
states.
thus,
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
a
wire
tapping
case,
we
do
not
have
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
case,
we
do
not
have
an
invasion
of
privacy.
we
have
a
case
where
these
petitioners
were
transmitting
messages
to
an
area
of
15,000
square
miles
for
everybody
to
hear.
now,
it's
a
strange
thing
if
everybody
can
hear,
but
if
a
federal
officer
hears
and
hears
that
there
is
a
violation
of
a
law
going
on
that
he
may
not
use
that
information
in
order
to
bring
the
petitioners
to
justice.
