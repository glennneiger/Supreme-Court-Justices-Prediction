accepted
this
assignment

i
believe

can
take
comfort

have
an
added
sense
of
security
that
the
lawyers
are
willing

accept
assignments
such
as
this
without
compensation
and
pursue
them
as
diligently
as
you
have.
but
mr.

i
say
that,
of
course,
without
belittling
at
all,
the
service
you
have
rendered
to
your
client,
the
state
of
florida.
