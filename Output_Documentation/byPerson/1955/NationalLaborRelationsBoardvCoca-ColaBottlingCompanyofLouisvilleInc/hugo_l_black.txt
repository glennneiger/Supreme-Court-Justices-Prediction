when
do
you
have
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
--
of
course
you
would
admit
that
--
agree
that
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
decision
so
that
the
union
can
know
who
have
filed
it
so
as
putting
this
pretty
bad
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
definition
would
you
give
it
instead
of
the
one
they
gave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
through
--
what
would
that
be
so
they'll
be
precise
enough
so
that
they
would
know
who
had
to
file
the
orders?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
understand
that.
but
what
would
you
suggest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
--
what
would
be
the
criterion?
when
they
started
out,
they
would
try
to
find
out
or
did
somebody
had
to
--
was
an
officer?
what
would
be
your
definition?
i'm
asking
because
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
first
that
you
quoted
what
you
would
say
the
definition
that
you
could
use
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
would
--
if
--
if
you
made
it
that
way
instead
among
other
things,
how
could
the
union
ever
know
once
and
there
was
a
hearing
whether
any
--
which
of
--
which
person
that
worked
for
us
were
officers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
looking
for
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
might
to
ask
you
about
fully
understood
just
what
you
said.
i
thought
that
the
answer
may
be
no.
did
i
understand
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
court
should
take
the
position
of
this
--
this
definition
is
good
and
that
should
be
the
reestablished
through,
it'd
be
little
of
importance
to
litigate
on
this
other
subject,
or,
when
--
when
they
--
if
i
raise
the
question
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
you'd
have
left
in
your
judgment
would
be
whether
this
man
was
an
officer
under
the
constitution
that
had
failed
to
agree.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
--
why
would
it
be
necessary
--
necessary
then
for
the
court
to
pass
on
the
first
question
if
it
decided
the
second
adverse
of
your
position.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
the
point
i
had
was
that
if
it
were
assumed
that
you
did
have
power
to
challenge
it
as
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
the
court
held
that
the
test
provided
by
the
board
was
correct.
thereafter,
would
there
be
much
left
to
litigate
or
would
there
be
any
reason
why
the
courts
should
pass
on
the
first
question
at
all
that
you
concede.
i
understood
you
to
take
the
position
at
the
practice,
there
just
nothing
left
on
this
--
in
connection
with
9
(h)
unless
the
--
the
court
decided
your
way
on
point
of
a
constitutional
test
laid
down
by
the
board.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
think
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear.
i
understand
your
position
is
that
that
test
is
no
good.
it
violates
the
act.
and
it
does
a
grave
injury
because
it
does
violate
the
act.
and
you
won't
have
a
right
to
present
evidence
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
functions
they
had
amounted
to
enough
to
come
within
some
definition.
but
assuming
that
you
lose
on
that,
what
you
win,
why
--
why
should
there
be
anything
left
in
connection
with
the
big
dispute
over
whether
the
board,
whether
the
company
can
raise
the
challenge.
would
there
still
be
something
left
to
fight
about
except
whether
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
part
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
question
about
this
man
taylor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
had
experience,
i
just
want
to
--
you'd
realize
that
your
definition
would
make
a
lot
of
top
sergeant
as
officers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
don't
deny
that.
i
had
one.
