as
long
as
that
doesn't
say
the
extension
of
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
the
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
a
suggestion
to
the
tribunal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
merely
outside
but
what
--
it's
entirely
a
matter
of
grace
to
you
whether
you
think
as
suggestion
and
act
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
we
urge
that
that
argument
is
in
the
argument
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
bothers
is
that
--
as
you
know
i
--
i
missed
the
difficulty
with
your
argument.
that
is
your
point
(inaudible)
decision.
probably,
the
ground
would
be
having
a
proper
a
case
entered.
and
congress
make
certain
qualifications
to
certain
facts
--
qualifications
or
conditions
to
the
board
to
act.
if
the
court
doesn't
order
a
stand
which
it
could
void
of
that
decision
and
there
is
no
question
it
is
the
ground
of
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
paraphrasing
more
awkwardly
with
nothing
to
do
with
statute
or
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
knew
it,
it
wouldn't
be
argued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
so
familiar
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
this
court
have
addressed
the
view
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
--
from
that
as
--
as
the
division
within
the
court
--
within
this
court
and
the
part
of
members
with
that
--
with
that
knowledge
of
this
problem.
so,
it
can't
be
so
obvious
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggested
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
court
but
mr.
justice
holmes
insisted
on.
we're
looking
for
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
not
the
meaning
of
congress.
so,
congress
expect
--
we
did
the
best
we
could
in
an
awful
burden
whether
this
court
provides
--
the
board
provides
and
agree
(inaudible)
with
the
board.
that
is
a
rather
complex
affidavit,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
be
waived
for
one
person
and
another
is
to
another.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
all
that
applies
to
whether
an
organization
is
a
labor
organization,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
what
i
mean
is
the
objection
with
which
i
have
made
simply
as
to
note
that
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
objection
to
allowing
a
litigation
of
--
of
jury
questions
and
therefore
diverting
the
attention,
diverting
the
reference,
apply
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
an
organization
is
a
labor
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
you
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
relation
of
the
man's
character
as
to
whether
he's
an
officer
of
an
enterprise
is
something
that
my
imagination
can't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
an
officer
doesn't
carry
with
it
--
delimiting
factors,
officers,
that's
not
a
loose
word,
anybody
who
exercises
authority
even
though
he's
a
private
in
the
army
of
an
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
certainly
two
different
questions.
one,
is
the
issue
of
who
is
an
officer,
an
issue
that
will
be
litigated
before
the
board
in
--
in
the
case
involving
the
merits
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
secondly,
what
the
contents,
what
the
criteria
are
for
determining
what
an
officer
is.
now,
that
may
be
cutdown
to
size
without
answering
the
other
question,
namely,
where
they
--
the
review
over
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question
as
a
matter
of
information.
there
are
somewhat
--
there
were
some
committee
in
connection
with
the
cio-afl,
not
directly,
isn't
that
true?
maybe
now
and
it's
commercial
here,
prior
to
something
or
other,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
question
will
arise
any
day,
or
the
truth
of
it,
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
highland
park?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
may
have
a
lot
of
--
you
may
have
a
lot
indication
regarding
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
thousand
per
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
have,
a
thousand
per
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
thousand
that
you
talked
about
a
minute
ago,
are
they
contested
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
how
many
are
contested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
roughly
200
or
20?
justice
felix
frankfurter
small
percentage
is
relevant
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
goldberg,
in
the
phrase
is
the
test
(inaudible)
the
board,
the
word
(inaudible)
doesn't
really
--
as
such
by
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
formula?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
in
the
intent
but
those
are
the
exact
words
that
the
board
has
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
look
behind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
--
well,
it
passed
on
what
it
--
specifically,
highland
park,
as
i
understand
it,
tells
that
the
determination
by
the
board
of
what
is
"labor
organization
and
the
appropriate
statutes"
is
not
left
definitively
for
the
board,
a
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you've
argued
best
about
it
is
that
would
--
would
allow
one
to
say
what
is
an
officer
is
not
conclusive
and
it
should
be
determined
by
the
board
but
officer
means
what
the
board
has
given
for
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
to
the
other
question
whether
it
is
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
draw
this
inference
from
your
argument
thus
far
that
this
court
might
well
--
i
mean
should,
i
should
say
should.
this
court
might
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
and
also
say
an
officer
invested
at
all
when
i
think
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he
represented
the
union
at
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you've
quoted
shows
that
these
members
of
congress
knew
that
they
were
worthy
of
the
english
language,
it
expressed
effective
power
as
against
a
word
like
"officer"
which
the
contingency
is
in
the
english
words
has
a
rather
restricted
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
word
like
--
a
word
like
authoritative
control
indicates
exertion
of
power
but
words
like
"officer"
indicate
a
relationship
between
people
who
occupy
offices
as
against
those
who
are
just
privates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
quote
any
kentucky
congressman
because
they
would
use
words
more
precisely,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
certainly
make
a
--
form,
an
effective
lawyer
of
the
union
is
an
officer
of
the
union,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
now
adjudicating
mr.
goldberg
responsibilities
that
having
in
view
that
a
lawyer
is
a
very
powerful
officer,
a
very
powerful
adviser
of
the
union
or
of
any
organization
and
that
would
make
him
an
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
what
is
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
outlined
in
--
goes
a
long
way
a
distance
in
the
definition,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
skaggs,
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
several
times,
used
the
word
ex
parte,
you
want
the
board
to
make
ex
parte
termination,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
say
--
when
you
said
that
to
my
ears,
with
my
understanding,
that
within
conflict
with
these
claims
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
allowed
in
the
main
course,
well
judicial
determination,
whether
or
not,
in
the
requirement
of
the
statute
has
then
fulfilled.
with
ex
parte,
how
can
there
be
judicial
reviews?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
understand
mr.
findling
in
behalf
of
the
board
to
suggest
that
they
asked
the
union
and
that
to
say
so
the
union
govern.
i
can't
imagine
that's
the
position
of
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
once
you
say
ex
parte,
then
i
do
not
think
you
can
limit
them
your
particular
mode
of
ascertaining
the
necessary
facts
to
conclusions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
say
--
it
may
determine
it
by
document.
they
had
board
judicial
notice
as
it
were,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
when
you
say
ex
parte,
it
takes
care
for
me
of
the
judicial
review
processes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
if
i
may
say
so,
i
should
like
to
give
justice
we
ask
the
defending
--
to
tell
us
to
bargain
on
behalf
of
the
board,
you
ought
to
be
in
position
whether
they
disavow
responsibility
as
ascertaining
on
their
responsibilities
who
are
the
officers
within
an
appropriate
test
to
what
is
enormous.
if
the
board
says
no,
we
first
take
the
say
so
of
the
union
as
such.
they're
not
thinking
quite
right
in
saying
they
have
advocated
their
responsibility
on
the
statute.
what
if
the
reply
should
be
that
the
board
has
defined
the
officers
in
a
certain
way
and
in
the
way
which
they
have,
subject
to
the
qualifications
that
the
union
can
place
--
should
not
against
board
like
keeping
an
office
but
(inaudible)
of
the
office
of
having
somebody
to
discharge
his
function,
as
i
understand
is
the
qualification
of
the
board.
and
they
think
that
is
a
fulfillment
of
their
responsibility
on
their
own
to
ascertaining
who
is
an
officer.
and
i
think
they'd
come
within
your
request
for
making
an
ex
parte
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
when
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
go
back
to
the
specific
case
you
gave?
as
i
understand
you
that
the
case
was
that
none
of
(inaudible)
refer
to
this.
he
in
fact
would
submit
--
would
have
acted
as

justice
felix

you
made
inquiry
as
to
whether
in
fact
it's
made

justice

is
the
situation.
