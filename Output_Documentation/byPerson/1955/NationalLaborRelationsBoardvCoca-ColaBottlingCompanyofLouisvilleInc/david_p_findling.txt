mr.
david
p.
findling
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
brought
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
review
an
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
remanding
the
case
to
the
board
with
instructions
to
take
evidence
regarding
the
union
officer's
status
of
a
cio
agent
named
w.b.
taylor
for
purposes
of
the
non-communist
affidavit
requirements
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
as
your
honors
may
recall,
section
9
(h)
which
has
already
been
before
the
court
in
three
labor
board
cases,
the
aca
against
douds
case,
the
highland
park
case,
and
the
dant
and
the
--
and
the
russell
case.
it
provides
generally
that
labor
unions
may
not
have
access
to
the
labor
board's
facilities
unless
their
officers
file
appropriate
non-communist
affidavits.
and
the
questions
in
this
case,
which
i
shall
formulate
more
specifically
in
just
a
minute,
involve
generally
the
meaning
of
the
word
"officer"
and
its
litigability
in
board
cases
and
they
arose
in
this
context.
during
a
conventional
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
before
the
board
under
section
10
of
the
act,
involving
allegations
with
respect
to
the
discriminatory
firings
of
three
union
employees
and
restraint
and
coercion
of
employees
but
of
course
they
had
adjoined
local
20
of
the
brewery
workers
international
union
affiliated
with
the
cio.
the
company
raised
the
question
which
it
tried
to
litigate
before
the
hearing
officer
and
the
board
whether
the
cio
had
in
fact
complied
in
as
much
as
no
non-communist
affidavits
had
been
filed
by
mr.
taylor
and
under
the
highland
park
decision
of
this
court,
it
was
necessary
for
the
cio
to
have
filed
the
affidavits
in
order
to
validate
the
charges
filed
by
local
20.
now,
taylor
was
regional
director
for
the
cio
in
kentucky.
the
regional
directors
with
whom
they
were
then
40
were
not
listed
by
the
cio
in
its
constitution
as
among
its
officers
nor
were
they
included
in
a
verified
form
which
under
board
regulations
was
required
to
be
filed
with
the
board
and
which
the
cio
had
filed
and
which
would
likewise
suppose
to
list
the
--
the
officers
of
the
cio.
but
the
company
contended
that
mr.
taylor
had
to
file
an
affidavit
anyway
because
as
it
in
substance
offered
to
prove
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
case.
as
regional
director,
he
was
charged
with
administrative
and
executive
duties
and
powers
over
local
20,
and
he
exercised
a
working
control
over
every
cio
local
union
and
affiliated
international
union
in
its
territory.
now,
the
board
rejected
this
company's
offense
and
offered
to
prove
--
and
offer
a
proof
and
it
held
two
things,
and
it's
the
correctness
of
these
two
holdings
that
present
the
specific
questions,
the
decision
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
board
held
in
accordance
with
its
consistent
practice
since
the
enactment
of
section
9
(h)
in
1947
that
the
question
whether
all
union
officers
had
in
fact
filed
the
appropriate
non-communist
affidavit
like
other
questions
go
into
details
with
respect
to
compliance
was
not
open
to
litigation
in
the
proceedings
on
the
merits
of
cases
before
the
board
but
was
a
matter
for
independent
administrative
determination
by
the
board
in
separate
collateral
proceeding.
and
secondly,
the
board
held
that
in
any
event
on
the
merits
and
even
if
the
company
had
presented
its
question
properly
from
a
procedural
standpoint,
taylor
was
not
an
officer
of
the
cio
because
again
under
the
board's
uniform
test,
he
neither
occupied
a
position
which
was
designated
as
an
office
in
the
constitution
of
the
cio
nor
was
there
any
assertion
of
proof
that
the
office
that
he
occupied
had
been
omitted
from
the
constitution
or
from
designation
as
an
office
in
order
to
circumvent
or
evade
the
filing
requirements
of
section
9
(h).
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
in
fact
has
been
done
in
a
good
many
cases.
perhaps,
a
dozen
and
a
half
such
cases.
and
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
the
--
the
employer,
anyone
else
interested
presents
evidence
that
leads
us
to
believe
that
there
may
be
suspicion
of
a
noncompliance.
mr.
david
p.
findling
he
can
do
it
in
the
litigation
or
he
may
do
it
outside
the
litigation.
very
frequently,
it's
been
in
the
litigation
itself.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor,
and
we've
investigated
administratively
in
separate
proceedings
and
decide
whether
or
not
it's
appropriate
for
further
investigation
and
determination.
and
so,
the
board
went
on
to
consider
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
we
invite
his
--
but
this
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
his
--
his
suggestion
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
evidence
he's
got.
mr.
david
p.
findling
right,
outside
of
the
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
case
or
the
representation
proceeding.
it's
to
be
conducted
by
the
board
in
--
in
separate
administrative
proceedings
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
in
the
sense
that's
true,
your
honor.
if
we
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
perhaps,
i
used
the
wrong
word.
i
think
it
is
for
us
to
decide
administratively
whether
or
not
further
investigation
of
the
assertions
he
makes
with
respect
to
noncompliance,
a
warrant
to
further
proceeding.
sometimes
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
we
may
hold
a
hearing
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
formal
hearing.
mr.
david
p.
findling
that's
right,
your
honor.
he
has
no
control
over
that
except
that
he
can
make
suggestions
of
course
and
so
on.
he
can
--
he
can
suggest
avenues
of
investigation.
mr.
david
p.
findling
not
in
open
hearing
on
the
merits
of
a
particular
proceeding.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
it
will
be
for
the
board
to
decide
whether
or
not
an
opening
hearing
is
warranted
on
the
basis
of
the
assertions
he
make.
mr.
david
p.
findling
that's
right,
your
honor.
he's
not
a
necessary
party,
i
think,
to
that
administrative
determination.
the
--
the
proceeding
would
be
normally
between
the
board
and
the
union,
on
a
union
by
union
basis
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
been
compliance
in
fact
or
not.
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
compliance
determination
is
not
going
to
be
controlling
simply
in
the
particular
case
in
which
raised
that
the
union
isn't
in
compliance
in
that
case,
it's
not
in
compliance
in
every
case.
mr.
david
p.
findling
we
--
the
board
decides
whether
or
not
the
assertions
with
respect
to
noncompliance
are
serious
enough
to
warrant
a
formal
hearing
or
not.
now,
the
board
would,
of
course,
make
an
informal
investigation
through
its
agent
to
determine
what
substance
there
was
if
any
after
the
--
the
assertion.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
david
p.
findling
so
far
as
i
know,
your
honor,
there
has
been
--
no
union
has
ever
been
held
not
to
be
in
compliance
administratively
where
there
was
substantial
issues
of
fact
let's
say
that
couldn't
be
determined
administratively
without
a
hearing,
but
i
don't
believe
a
hearing
would
always
be
necessary.
the
board,
for
example,
could
say
that
an
affidavit
was
technically
improper
because
let's
say
the
jury
wasn't
effective.
i
don't
believe
we
have
a
hearing
on
that.
now,
of
course,
if
there
were
an
issue
of
fact
that
resolved
--
required
resolution,
perhaps
the
union
could
demand
a
hearing
and
get
it.
but
i
know
of
no
case
where
there's
been
that
kind
of
substantial
problem
where
the
board
has
decomplied
a
union
without
a
hearing.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i'm
sorry?
mr.
david
p.
findling
no.
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
so,
as
i
say,
the
board
went
on
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
case
and
issued
the
usual
remedial
order
on
violations
which
it
found
of
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
act.
when
the
board
then
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
for
enforcement
of
the
order,
however,
that
court,
without
reaching
the
merits
of
the
case,
remanded
it
to
the
board
in
the
order
that
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning.
the
order
appears
at
page
541a
of
the
record
and
was
not
accompanied
by
a
separate
opinion.
but
as
we
read
the
order,
the
court
held
in
substance
that
under
the
highland
park
decision
of
this
court,
the
question
whether
the
cio
was
in
compliance
with
section
9
(h)
because
of
mr.
taylor's
failure
to
file
an
affidavit,
was
subject
to
litigation
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
and
further,
the
court
rejected
the
board's
test,
which
i've
just
described,
for
determining
who
are
union
officers
and
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
constitutional
passing
for
simplicity
--
for
purposes
of
simplicity.
and
it
instructed
the
board
to
reopen
the
unfair
labor
practice
case
in
order
to
permit
the
company
to
introduce
testimony
as
to
taylor's
functions
and
extent
of
jurisdiction
as
regional
director
of
the
cio
and
to
make
relevant
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
certify
them
to
the
court
and
it's
to
review
those
rulings
that
we
brought
the
case
here.
now,
whether
the
board's
position
is
right
or
wrong
depends,
of
course,
upon
what
congress
intended.
and
unfortunately,
congress
not
only
did
not
define
the
word
"officer"
on
the
face
of
the
statute
but
we
haven't
been
able
to
find
anything
in
the
authoritative
committee
reports
or
in
the
debates
that
shows
that
congress
specifically
considered
the
question
of
what
the
word
"officer"
should
mean.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
generally,
congress
simply
used
the
word
"officer"
and
sometimes
it
used
the
words
"union
leaders"
interchangeably
apparently
on
the
assumption
that
its
meaning
was
perfectly
plain.
and
after
examining
the
dictionaries
and
looking
into
some
board
--
some
court
decisions
involving
other
statutes
and
arising
in
other
context,
i
don't
believe
that
they're
conclusive
either.
we've
collected
whatever
we
though
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
in
our
brief
and
the
company
has
done
the
same
thing
in
its
brief.
and
i
don't
believe
it's
worth
spending
any
oral
argument
and
time
to
discuss
that
aspect
of
the
case.
i
think
that
if
any
conclusions
are
to
be
drawn
from
these
sources,
they
suggest
that
congress
had
in
mind
high
elective
office
in
union.
and
i
believe
that
this
court
in
the
dant
&
russell
case,
well
not
of
course
specifically
addressing
itself
to
this
question,
apparently
likewise
assumed
that
because
the
court's
opinion
revised
it
to
the
elective
--
the
fluid
and
elective
nature
of
union
officials
and
the
election
of
new
union
officers
as
--
as
presenting
problem
with
respective
continuous
compliance.
similarly,
while
we
think
the
legislative
history,
which
i
shall
discuss
in
just
a
second,
does
show
a
clear
congressional
intention
with
respect
to
the
non-litigability
of
compliance
question,
this
court
held
in
the
highland
park
case
that
one
phase
of
compliance
whether
the
cio
and
the
af
of
l
were
labor
organizations
which
were
required
to
comply
was
litigable.
and
--
and
although
we
think
and
i
shall
argue
this
a
little
later
on
that
the
highland
park
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
and
not
controlling,
nevertheless,
we
don't
find
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
that
congress
specifically
considered
the
question
whether
the
word
"union
officer"
should
be
litigable
in
the
same
way
as
the
word
"labor
organization"
was
held
litigable
in
highland
park.
and
so,
we're
--
we're
required
to
find
the
legislative
intention
in
the
statute
generally
and
we're
required
to
draw
inferences
as
best
we
can
as
to
what
congress
intended
from
what
it
said
and
did
in
related
connection.
and
if
there's
anything
that
seems
to
us
to
be
crystal
clear
about
the
congressional
intention
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
section
9
(h)
and
its
companion
sections,
9
(f)
and
(g)
which
deal
with
financial
and
registration
requirement,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
that
congress
realized
and
intended
to
avoid
the
very
serious
danger
that
administration
of
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
should
be
so
complicated,
so
time
consuming,
so
diverting
the
board
energies
as
to
hopelessly
delay,
seriously
complicate
and
impede
administration
of
what
congress
continued
to
regard
as
the
board's
fundamental
tasks
of
preventing
unfair
labor
practices
and
resolving
disputes
concerning
representation.
and
it's
the
effectuation
of
that
congressional
intention
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
our
position
here,
as
the
board
stated
in
its
decision.
that
congressional
intention
is
made
plain,
i
think,
time
and
time
again
during
the
course
of
passage
of
the
amendments
of
1947.
and
as
i
think
the
key
to
the
whole
congressional
approach
to
section
9
(h)
to
the
communist
problem
in
labor
union
as
congress
sought
to
meet
it
in
the
labor
relations
act.
it
was
that
consideration
for
example
which
prompted
the
congress
to
require
the
mere
filing
of
non-communist
affidavits
instead
of
requiring
the
board
to
determine
whether
union
officers
were
in
fact
communist
or
not
and
to
--
and
to
litigate
the
veracity
of
the
non-communist
affidavits
and
whether
the
affidavits
were
truthful
or
not
as
the
original
--
both
senate
and
house
bills
would
have
done.
and
senator
taft
explained
on
at
least
three
occasions
that
the
change
was
made
on
the
basis
that
representation
proceedings
might
be
indefinitely
delayed
if
the
board
were
required
to
examine
the
character
of
union
leaders.
and
he
said
that
certification
of
representatives
might
be
tied
up
for
months
and
that
endless
delays
in
board
proceedings
would
result.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
the
court
might
very
well
have
attributed
the
intention
that
it
did
in
highland
park,
the
litigation
of
a
question
like
what
the
word
"labor
organization"
means.
and
that
congress
might
very
well
have
had
an
entirely
different
contention
with
respect
to
the
litigation
of
a
question
like
union
officer
status
and
other
details
of
compliance
which
do
result
as
i'm
going
to
argue
a
little
later
on
in
more
detail
if
i
may,
which
do
result
in
bagging
down
an
administrative
problems
of
unworkability
and
so
on
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
cases.
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
but,
your
honor,
really,
what
we're
looking
for
after
all
is
what
congress
intended
and
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
i'm
trying
to
help
you
find
it
if
i
may.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
litigation
of
the
word
--
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
"labor
organization"
which
in
the
first
place
involves
a
statutory
definition,
we've
got
a
statutory
definition.
second,
it's
the
kind
of
thing
that's
a
familiar
concept
with
the
board.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
very
rarely
controverted
whether
or
not
if
it
is
a
labor
organization
or
not
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
which
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
--
i
started
out,
your
honor,
suggesting
that
it
was
far
from
clear
what
the
--
in
the
sense
that
we
don't
have
any
very
plain
guides
or
i
think
we
have
clear
guides
to
the
congressional
intention
with
respect
to
non-litigability.
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
all
i
want
to
suggest
is
that
congress
may
well
of
--
may
very
well
--
that
the
statute
may
very
well
be
read
as
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
of
the
different
consequences
that
result
from
one
reading
as
against
another
in
terms
of
what
we
do
know
about
the
congressional
intention
with
respect
to
administration
of
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h).
now,
the
joint
committee
the
so-called
watchdog
committee,
which
was
set
up
in
1948
--
in
1947
to
study
and
investigate
the
administration
and
operation
of
the
labor
laws
--
federal
labor
laws,
also
pointed
out
in
the
report
which
it
filed
in
1948
that
in
considering
amendments
to
the
act
and
among
the
amendments
was
a
proposed
amendment
dealing
with
enlargement
of
the
definition
of
the
word
"officer."
it
said
that
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
board
hearings
should
be
confined
to
the
evidence
going
into
the
merits
of
the
case
at
hand.
if
the
board
--
and
i'm
reading
from
the
--
from
the
report,
if
the
board
is
to
carryout
its
real
function
of
deciding
unfair
labor
practice
cases
and
determining
bargaining
representatives
and
it
said
and
again
i
use
its
words,
it
wanted
to
emphasize
as
strongly
as
possible
that
in
order
to
achieve
that
purpose
and
to
prevent
what
it
called
hopeless
overburdening
of
board
records
and
board
hearings,
great
care
must
be
used
to
prevent
litigation
of
questions
of
compliance
in
a
--
in
board
cases.
and
its
recognition
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
the
court
was
talking
about,
i
think,
litigation
of
questions
of
compliance
generally,
the
truth
and
veracity
of
affidavits
for
example.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
the
statute
may
be
interpreted
as
this
court
did
in
highland
park,
we're
not
--
we
can't
reargue
highland
park
here.
the
statute
may
be
interpreted
as
the
court
did
in
highland
park
as
permitting
litigation
of
a
question
like
the
word
"labor
organization"
because,
one,
because
it
doesn't
create
the
difficulties
of
administration,
the
delays
and
so
on
that
congress
so
clearly
wanted
to
avoid
whereas
litigation
of
the
union
officer
question
and
other
details
of
compliance
does.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
one
creates
problems
in
the
--
doesn't
create
problems
necessarily
and
they
ever
does
is
this.
in
the
first
place,
as
i
suggested,
the
word
"labor
organization"
has
a
statutory
definition,
the
word
"union
officer"
doesn't.
in
the
second
place,
it's
rarely
controverted
in
board
proceedings.
in
the
third
place,
once
the
board
decides
that
a
given
outfit
is
a
labor
organization,
that's
usually
the
end
of
the
matter,
it's
fixed.
on
the
other
hand,
applying
a
functional,
a
so-called
functional
test
to
determine
whether
a
man
is
a
union
officer
or
not,
as
the
court
below
and
--
and
the
company
would
contend
for,
involves
investigation,
not
only
of
a
man's
formal
duties
and
responsibilities,
it
depends
on
his
influence.
in
this
case,
it
depends
on
his
working
control,
although
what
were
in
forms
were
about
88
cio
locals
in
kentucky
and
17
internationals.
it
involves
an
exploration
of
the
man's
character,
the
grasp
of
his
job,
his
personal
relations
with
others
and
so
on.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
suggest
that's
it's
a
matter
of
familiar
experience
that
a
man,
although
allocated
specific
duties,
may
not
exercise
the
same
influence
and
control
over
his
associates
and
other
organizations
than
another
man
with
the
same
duty
does.
mr.
david
p.
findling
and
the
key
here
is
working
control,
influence,
responsibility,
and
authority.
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
--
but,
your
honor,
for
example
an
officer
who
has
responsibility
for
participating
in
collective
bargaining
negotiations
may
or
may
not
exercise
working
control
over
the
labor
organizations
in
his
area.
and
that's
the
--
that's
one
of
the
things,
as
we
read
the
court's
remand
and
certainly
as
the
company
reads
it,
that
we're
required
to
explore
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the
company's
test,
it
contemplates
that
under
the
court's
remand,
the
board
would
examine
and
determine
and
i've
been
careful,
i
hope,
to
use
only
the
company's
language
in
this
connection,
would
examine
and
determine
taylor's
power
and
influence,
his
responsibility
and
authority
and
prestige
among
cio
members,
his
opportunities
to
control
and
manipulate
a
sizable
segment
of
the
labor
movement
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
getting
back
to
the
review
over
question,
i
haven't
quite
completed
my
answer
and
i'd
like
to
at
this
point
in
view
of
your
honor's
coming
back
to
it.
as
i
say,
there
could
have
been
a
difference
in
intention
because
of
the
difference
in
consequences.
besides
that,
the
question
in
highland
park
was
whether
the
af
of
l
and
the
cio
were
labor
organizations.
here,
the
question
is
whether
and
there's
no
dispute
here
that
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
that
--
that
cio
international
and
local
are
labor
organizations.
the
question
is
have
they
in
fact
complied?
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
there
are
committees
certainly.
mr.
david
p.
findling
that's
true.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
i've
tried
to
answer
that
aspect
of
the
problem
from
a
standpoint
of
the
workability
in
the
sense
that
i've
tried
to
suggest
that
litigation
of
whether
those
committees
and
so
on,
the
labor
organization,
doesn't
involve
the
board
necessarily.
in
the
delays,
overburdening
of
records
and
so
on,
that
litigation
of
questions
like
union
officers
status
and
other
details
of
compliance
necessarily
do
and
so
congress
may
have
intended
a
different
consequence
as
to
litigation.
first,
i
was
trying
to
point
up
again
the
difference
between
highland
park
and
this
case.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
i
defer
to
your
honor's
question,
although
i
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
i
--
i
was
going
to
add
this,
your
honor,
and
thank
you
for
permitting
me
to
interrupt.
i
was
going
to
say
that
in
highland
park
itself,
the
court
said
that
if
the
question
was
whether
the
cio
had
in
fact
complied,
a
different
question
would
be
presented
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
question
that's
presented
here,
of
course
as
i've
said,
there's
no
dispute
here
that
the
cio,
the
international
and
the
local
are
labor
organizations
that
have
to
file
the
affidavit.the
question
is
whether
they
have
in
fact
met
them.
and
i've
assumed
that
the
reason
that
the
court
reserved
the
question
was
because
the
court
thought
that
there
might
be
a
difference
in
result
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
question
along
those
lines.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
it
first
arose,
i
think
even
before
the
complaint
issue
--
issue
by
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
proceedings
for
noncompliance.
and
there
was
a
motion
made
at
the
--
i
think
at
--
it
was
after
the
complaint
issued
but
before
the
hearing
opened.
there
was
a
motion
made
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
that
was
denied
by
the
trial
examiner
on
the
basis
of
board
authority.
the
motion
was
renewed
at
the
hearing
and
there
was
an
offer
of
proof
made
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
then
there
were
exceptions
to
the
trial
examiner's
ruling
and
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
board
on
exceptions
and
the
board
rules
on
it.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
but
the
motion
to
dismiss,
your
honor,
was
based
on
--
on
the
fact
that
the
complaint
didn't
show
on
its
face
that
the
--
didn't
allege
that
the
union
had
in
fact
complied.
so,
i
don't
believe
it's
quite
accurate
to
say
that
the
company
has
ever
presented
its
position
with
respect
to
the
officer
union
status
of
this
man
for
administrative
determination.
it
--
it
has
always
been
made
on
the
basis
of
a
challenge
in
the
proceedings
on
the
merits
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
case
before
the
board.
as
i
say,
they
said
the
complaint,
alleging
discriminatory
discharges
and
restraint
and
coercion
is
defective
because
it
doesn't
show
or
allege
compliance.
and
they
said
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
board
was
required
--
general
counsel
was
required
to
make
the
compliance
data
a
matter
of
record.
it
should
have
been
attached
for
example,
i
think
they
suggested
to
the
complaint
itself
in
order
to
support
the
complaint
that
it
was
jurisdictional
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
case.
and
the
board
has
held
--
and
i
don't
believe
counsel
will
challenge
this,
the
board
said
in
the
--
and
i
don't
believe
counsel
will
challenge
it
that
they've
never
attempted
to
have
the
board
resolve
the
--
the
question
presented
in
a
--
in
an
independent
administrative
proceedings.
it's
always
been
within
the
framework
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
case.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
us
to
do
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
to
take
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
of
course
they
raised
this,
we
applied.
if
we
had
thought
there
was
some
substance
to
the
matters
asserted
in
their
motion
to
dismiss
for
example,
the
board
undoubtedly
would
have
conducted
a
separate
administrative
investigation
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
in
fact
compliance.
we
do
that
all
the
time,
we
have
to.
mr.
david
p.
findling
exactly.
and
in
the
proceeding
which
involve
the
allegations
that
they
fired
three
people
because
of
union
activities
and
engaged
in
restraint
and
coercion,
not
separately.
now,
there's
--
there's
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
your
honors,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
i
think
between
conducting
a
separate
administrative
investigation
into
compliance
and
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
would
have
been
involved
if
we
had
gone
along
with
the
company's
position.
for
one
thing,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
if
we
had
gone
along
with
the
company's
position
and
permitted
a
litigation
of
the
union
officer
status,
of
taylor
in
this
case,
it's
not
very
difficult
to
see
how
the
merits
of
the
case
involving
a
simple
factual
question
as
to
whether
three
men
had
been
fired,
because
they
had
engaged
in
union
activities
and
so
on,
would
be
completely
submerged
in
this
welter
of
side
issues
with
respect
to
the
compliance
details.
beyond
that
and
more
importantly,
if
we'd
gone
ahead
with
--
with
the
investigation,
exploration
of
the
issues
the
company
proposed,
we'd
have
--
we
have
had
to
do
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
in
other
words,
the
determination
whether
taylor
was
a
union
officer
would
be
made
in
this
case.
and
it
couldn't
be
made
on
a
union
by
union
basis
because
i
think
it's
clear
that
any
board
finding
in
this
case,
as
to
taylor's
union
officer
status,
would
not
be
res
judicata.
in
any
other
case
involving
unfair
labor
practices
or
representation
proceeding,
where
another
party
tried
to
raise
the
same
issue,
he'd
be
entitled
to
make
his
own
record
as
to
the
union
officer
status
of
a
particular
union
agent.
indeed,
he
might
even
be
entitled
to
make
his
own
record
as
to
taylor's
union
officer
status.
certainly,
that
would
be
true
if
he
had
new
evidence
that
he
offered.
and
so,
that
we'd
have
to
be
litigating
it
in
every
one
of
the
thousands
of
unfair
labor
practice
and
representation
cases.
on
the
other
hand,
to
permit
it
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
david
p.
findling
oh,
your
honor,
we
have
about
400
or
500
unfair
labor
practice
cases
and
several
thousand
representation
cases
a
year.
yes.
mr.
david
p.
findling
a
year,
yes
your
honor.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
litigating
it
in
independent
administrative
proceeding
means
that
we
do
handle
compliance
on
a
union
by
union
basis
once
the
board
decides.
for
example,
in
this
case,
if
the
board
should
find
in
this
case,
in
the
separate
administrative
proceedings,
that
the
cio
was
not
in
compliance
because
mr.
taylor
should
have
but
had
not
filed
an
affidavit,
that
doesn't
affect
simply
this
case
in
which
it
happens
to
be
litigated.
it
means
that
every
cio
case,
every
case
filed
by
the
cio,
by
any
international
and
by
any
local
union
affiliated
with
it
since
1949
may
be
more
or
less
in
jeopardy.
i'm
not
suggesting
they
all
are
of
course
but
certainly,
outstanding
certifications
are
subject
to
challenge.
the
union
shop
agreements
which
depend
on
the
compliance
status
of
the
union
in
question
may
be
subject
to
challenge
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
and
pending
complaint
cases.
mr.
david
p.
findling
oh,
no,
your
honor.
not
all
are.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
should
know
the
answer.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
i
think
--
i
think
about
10%
of
the
400
or
500
unfair
labor
practice
cases
actually
go
to
formal
contest.
now,
the
representation
cases,
i'm
not
as
familiar
with
this.
i
perhaps
should
be
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
my
guess
would
be
about
20%
perhaps
go
to
formal
hearings.
so,
they
say
the
--
the
administrative
way
of
handling
it
has
the
advantage,
well,
it's
almost
a
necessary
way
of
handling
it.
if
you're
going
to
handle
compliance,
the
only
way
that
the
necessities
of
the
situation
require
it
be
handled,
that
is
on
a
union
by
union
basis.
and
beyond
that,
handling
it
administratively
gives
the
board
the
kind
of
flexibility
that
i've
been
talking
about
in
handling.
in
other
words,
we
don't
have
to
explore
on
the
record
of
--
of
a
case
by
formal
hearing
necessarily,
whether
there
have
been
compliance
with
the
many
details
involved
in
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h),
the
board
can
decide
for
itself
whether
the
assertions
made
require
a
hearing.
now,
we
have
in
one
or
two
cases
had
formal
hearings
administratively
to
determine
whether
a
union
was
in
compliance
or
not.
but
if
the
matter
is
to
be
litigated
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
itself,
the
thing
--
that
the
thing
has
no
flexibility
at
all.
and
finally,
there's
a
difference
in
the
parties
involved.
the
administrative
way
of
handling
it
means
that
the
board
deals
with
the
union
which
--
whose
whole
compliance
situation
is
affected
instead
of
the
matter
being
left
to
resolution
in
a
single
case
involving
an
employer
who
after
all
has
at
best,
we
think,
a
relevantly
collateral
interest
in
that
--
in
that
determination.
he's
interested
in
defending
himself
against
the
unfair
labor
practice
cases
and
the
--
the
provisions
of
the
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
weren't
written
into
the
statute
to
protect
him
as
an
individual
again
so
that
he'll
have
a
defense
to
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
even
--
even
if
we
were
to
assume,
contrary
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held,
that
the
matter
were
the
--
the
definition
of
the
word
"union
officer,"
the
officer
status
of
mr.
taylor
was
a
matter
that
could
be
determined
by
the
board
administratively.
we
think
that
it
would
present
the
very
serious
problems
of
compliance
and
lapses
and
so
on
which
this
court
referred
to
in
the
dant
&
russell
case,
changes
in
elections
and
so
on
which
made
compliance,
at
any
given
moment,
a
matter
of
happenstance
and
to
make
a
continuos
--
continuos
compliance
a
matter
of
happenstance.
and
i
suggest
that
even
in
administrative
determination
and
administrative
inquiry,
every
time
an
assertion
was
made
that
a
man's
functions,
the
relationships
have
changed
so
that
he
was
now
a
union
officer
would
bar
down
the
statute,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
would
result
in
many
cases,
in
the
very
delays
that
congress
wanted
to
avoid.
as
practical
matter,
many
collective
bargaining
negotiations
and
several
many
representations
cases
where
we
have
to
check
compliance
several
times
during
the
investigation
because
the
whole
investigation
depends
on
it
would,
as
a
practical
matter,
probably
barred
down
because
much
of
the
work
and
negotiations
would
be
subject
to
challenge
later
on.
now,
the
--
the
company
has
suggested
that
--
well,
before
i
get
to
the
company's
suggestion,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
one
more
point.
we
don't
believe
that
this
court
should
attribute
the
kind
of
result
that
i
have
described
in
terms
of
the
workable
administration
of
the
statute
to
--
to
congress
unless
its
absolutely
clear
that
to
do
so
is
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
what
congress
intended
to
achieve
in
writing
section
9
(h)
into
the
law.
and
we
don't
think
it
is,
quite
the
contrary
we
think
that
the
board's
approach
reasonably
achieves
that
purpose
and
this
is
why.
in
the
first
place,
the
communism
and
communist
we
know
don't
usually,
certainly
at
least
in
connection
with
the
union
organizational
activities,
stand
up
to
be
counted
anyway.
and
so,
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
congress
realized
that
on
any
test
of
the
word
"officer,"
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
communist
would
work
themselves
into
positions
of
authority
and
influence
and
importance
in
labor
unions.
beyond
that,
we
think
that
the
company's
contention
in
that
respect
overlooks
the
key
fact
that
the
approach
that
congress
made
to
the
communist
problem
in
labor
unions
in
our
act
was
not
a
direct
head
on
approach.
it
was
a
more
or
less
indirect
limited
approach
based
on
the
necessities
of
administration
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
act
with
respect
to
unfair
labor
practices
in
representation
cases
that
i've
described.
now,
it's
significant,
i
think,
that
congress
took
a
more
direct
approach
later
on
in
the
communist
control
act
of
1954,
when
it
denied
unions
the
privilege
of
representing
employees
for
collective
bargaining
purposes
and
withdrew
other
benefits
from
them
if
they
were
communist
infiltrated.
but
it's
also
significant
that
when
congress
took
that
approach,
it
made
the
responsibility
for
administration
and
for
the
hearings
and
fact
findings
involved,
not
the
job
of
the
n.l.r.b.
but
the
job
of
subversive
activities
control
board.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
that
report
of
the
joint
committee
to
which
i've
preferred
made
in
1948,
the
committee
said
that
elimination
of
communist
partisans
and
adherence
from
official
post
and
positions
of
responsibility
in
both
national
and
local
union
is
the
one
of
the
most
pronounced
and
significant
effects
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947.
so
that
it
seems
clear
that
congress
thought
that
in
1947,
when
it
wrote
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
that's
the
--
the
report
of
the
--
the
watchdog
committee
set
up
to
supervise
the
working
of
the
federal
labor
law
to
--
to
adjudge
its
administration
and
so
on.
but
i
say
--
i
thinks
it's
clear
that
in
1947,
when
congress
wrote
section
9
(h),
it
thought
and
the
joint
committee
in
1948
agreed
that
even
the
limited
approach
with
which
the
necessities
of
administration
required
that
was
made
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
eliminate
the
main
possibilities
of
communist
control
of
labor
unions
and
of
political
strikes
which
were
what
congress
was
after.
and
i
think
that
in
the
absence
of
deliberate
fraud
or
purpose
of
evasion
which
under
the
board's
rules
are
--
are
prevented,
it's
reasonable
to
expect
that
the
people
who
hold
the
positions
that
are
designated
as
officers
in
the
union's
governing
rules,
constitutional
bylaws,
are
usually
as
we
show
in
our
brief
the
--
occupied
by
people
who
command
the
greatest
influence,
who
are
the
union
leaders
and
who
have
the
most
authority
among
the
membership.
and
as
we
show
in
our
brief
also,
they
usually
constitute
a
substantial
portion
of
the
union's
executive
board,
they're
usually
responsible
for
the
hiring
and
firing
of
the
personnel
including
regional
director
taylor
by
the
way,
who
was
not
an
elective
officer,
he's
appointed
by
one
of
the
vice
presidents
of
the
cio.
the
vice
president
is
an
elective
officer.
and
they
usually
control
the
overall
supervision
and
management
of
the
union
affairs
on
a
day
by
day
basis.
so
that
as
i
say,
i
think
that
congress
could
reasonably
have
expected
that
the
board's
approach
to
this
problem
does
tend
to
reach
the
main
--
the
most
important
people
who
have
influence
and
authority
in
the
union.
now,
it's
true
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
david
p.
findling
the
language
you
--
yes.
the
board
may
not
proceed
unless
--
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
assume
your
honor
is
talking
about
judicial
review
of
the
question
whether
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
there
may
be
judicial
review
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
state
of
the
law
in
this
district
--
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
now.
apparently,
review
may
be
obtained
of
the
board's
administrative
determination
with
respect
to
compliance
by
an
equity
suit
in
the
district
court.
but
let
me
say
this,
i
--
i
don't
really
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
board
member
rogers
in
this
case
said
that
he
thought
the
administrative
determination
was
subject
to
judicial
review
under
section
10
(a)
and
(f)
that
would
be
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
other
three
board
members
who
participated
said
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
we
don't
believe
that
effect,
your
honor.
if
it's
--
if
the
--
of
our
act
already
precludes
it,
the
administrative
procedure
act
doesn't
give
the
courts
anything
more.
the
other
three
board
members
said
that
--
that
whether
into
what
extent
it
was
judicial
--
judicially
reviewable
was
a
matter
for
the
courts
to
determine.
and
the
--
the
situation,
the
matter
of
judicial
review
has
come
up
in
four
or
five
proceedings
where
we've
conducted
administrative
inquiries,
for
example,
on
the
basis
of
the
conviction
of
mr.
gold
for
filing
a
false
affidavit,
we
decomplied
the
union.
the
proceeding
was
brought
in
the
district
court
from
the
district
of
columbia
to
enjoin
us
from
giving
effect
to
that
decompliance
action
and
we
lost
the
lawsuit.
but
--
but
we
--
we
argued
that
the
court
--
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
but
the
district
court
held
that
it
had
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
and
in
the
(inaudible)
against
farmers
case,
in
a
somewhat
similar
situation,
where
again
we
tried
to
conduct
an
administrative
inquiry
and
were
enjoined,
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
was
jurisdiction
and
we
presented
that
as
one
question
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
so,
i
--
i
don't
know
exactly
what
the
law
is
except
as
i've
attempted
to
describe
it.
i
must
reserve
just
a
little
time,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
your
honor,
thank
you.
of
course,
we
don't
permit
the
unions
to
tell
us
what
our
officer
test
is
going
to
be
nor
to
determine
who
are
the
officers.
we've
established
the
--
the
definition
of
the
word
"officer"
on
our
own
responsibility.
and
in
addition
to
looking
at
the
constitution
which
has
to
be
filed
with
us,
we
require
the
unions
to
submit,
to
what
we
call
a
form
1080
which
is
a
--
a
testament
under
oath
and
subject
to
the
usual
penalties
and
perjuries
in
which
they
require
to
state
who
the
officers
are
according
to
their
constitution
and
by
laws.
and
if
there's
any
suggestion
from
any
responsible
source,
if
it's
been
evasion
or
fraud
that
we
investigate
that
and
it
hasn't,
it
isn't
limited
to
the
situation
where
a
man's
name
comes
out
of
the
constitution.
of
course,
that's
the
most
obvious
suspicious
circumstance
and
that
has
been
the
one
that
has
come
up
most
often.
but
there
have
been
situations,
for
example,
where
a
--
a
union
president
resigned
after
charges
of
communist
affiliation,
and
the
assertion
has
been
made
that
despite
his
resignation,
the
--
the
--
he's
continued
to
discharge
the
office
of
president,
we'd
looked
at
that
administratively.
and
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
we
have
had
--
in
which
testimony
it
was
taken,
your
honor?
mr.
david
p.
findling
only
one
but
not
under
section
9
(h).
it
was
in
connection
with
the
failure
to
--
to
serve
copies
of
financial
statements
on
all
union
members.
in
the
9
(h)
situations,
we
view
--
we've
issued
a
rule
to
show
cause.
it's
to
show
why
the
union
shouldn't
be
declared
out
of
compliance,
for
example,
because
of
the
failure
of
a
given
union
agent
to
file
an
affidavit,
there's
been
a
response
and
the
board
has,
up
to
now,
and
i
think
there
have
been
about
18
or
so
such
cases
the
board
has
up
to
now
been
able
to
determine
the
question
on
the
basis
of
the
return
and
the
briefs
and
argument
and
so
on.
in
some
cases,
the
board
has
said
that
new
affidavits
are
required
for
people
not
designated
as
officers.
mr.
david
p.
findling
now,
in
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
we
--
we
looked
in
--
yes,
your
honor.
we
looked
into
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
yes,
sir.
we
looked
into
the
situation
to
see
whether
or
not
the
assertion
is
made,
that
the
particular
man
who
had
resigned
as
president
continued
to
function
as
president
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
--
but
we
conducted
administratively
and
no
hearing,
no
formal
hearing.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
your
honor,
we
listened
--
we
invited
--
we
invited
the
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
no
--
no
formal
hearing,
your
honor.
we
didn't
permit
him
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
no.
it
has
--
he
wasn't.
the
board
found
after
conducting
the
investigation
that
on
the
basis
of
admitted
facts,
it
wasn't
necessary
to
go
further.
as
i
say,
if
the
facts
were
disputed,
undoubtedly,
the
board
would
conduct
a
formal
hearing.we
have
in
one
case,
not
under
9
(h).
but
in
the
other
cases,
we
haven't
found
it
necessary
to
do
so,
but
i
--
i
want
to
correct
that
any
impression
that
the
board
will
close
its
ears
to
evidence
from
any
source,
whether
it
happens
to
be
the
particular
employer
in
a
particular
case
or
not
with
respect
to
an
abuse
of
its
processes.
now,
we
backed
it
on
presentments
by
a
grand
jury.
we
backed
it
on
indictments.
we
backed
it
on
the
basis
of
the
published
statements
and
newspapers,
even,
made
simultaneously
with
an
execution
of
an
affidavit
which
seemed
inconsistent
with
the
assertions
made
in
the
affidavit
that
we'll
take,
we'll
listen
to
any
source.
but
we,
under
the
administrative
procedures
we
follow,
will
determine
administratively
whether
or
not,
what
further
evidence
needs
to
be
taken,
whether
a
formal
hearing
at
which
formal
evidence
has
taken
us
on.
and
we've
taken
the
position
that
that
question
is
not
subject
to
litigation
in
the
particular
unfair
labor
practice
case
which
may
be
pending
at
the
time
and
in
which
some
citizen
in
this
case,
it
happens
to
be
an
employer
who
has
an
interest
that
comes
forward
with
the
evidence.
in
this
case,
it
wouldn't
matter
to
us
that
the
coca-cola
company
was
a
party
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
case.
we
would
welcome
any
evidence
they
hand
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
they're
involved
in
this
particular
case.
if
it
affected
an
--
an
abuse
of
process
in
connection
with
the
submission
of
the
9
(h)
affidavits
and
that's
the
way
we've
acted
in
the
past.
mr.
david
p.
findling
well
your
honor,
under
our
rules
and
--
and
mr.
--
the
coca-cola
company
had
this
privilege
here,
they
came
into
our
office.
and
under
--
under
supervision,
we
won't
let
them
go
through
our
files
without
some
supervision,
but
they
were
permitted
to
go
through
our
files
and
look
through
the
affidavits.
and
that
was
in
19
--
late
june
--
july
1951.
and
then
in
1952,
they
came
back
and
asked
to
look
at
the
affidavits
again
and
at
that
time,
we
sent
them
a
letter
in
which
we
said
what
our
record
showed.
in
other
words,
the
board
doesn't
refuse
to
disclose
to
any
interested
party
whatever
information
it
has
on
the
file,
but
it
--
and
that's
would
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
david
p.
findling
so
we
give
it
to
them.
mr.
david
p.
findling
that
is
true,
your
honor.
we
take
the
position
that
the
question
whether
or
not
a
union
is
in
compliance
with
the
9
(h)
is
a
matter
between
the
union
and
the
board
not
subject
to
litigation
in
a
particular
unfair
labor
practice.
but
as
i
say
and
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
david
p.
findling
or
in
the
representation
case.
it's
only
subject
to
examination
in
an
independent
administrative
inquiry
conducted
by
the
board.
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself
unduly,
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
we
--
we
invite
--
we
invite
evidence
of
abuse
of
the
compliance,
the
date
and
so
on.
and
we've
conducted,
as
i
say,
in
numerous
inquiries.
mr.
david
p.
findling
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
p.
findling
well,
if
anybody
has
any
evidence,
we'll
look
at
it
but
we
--
we
say,
we
don't
have
to
make
that
the
subject
of
a
formal
hearing
everytime
somebody
comes
in
with
something
on
it.
and
he
can't
clutter
up
the
record
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
with
that.
it
goes
to
the
whole
--
it
goes
to
every
case
that
the
cio
or
the
afl
was
filed,
not
to
the
particular
case.
now,
i
--
i
made
a
grossly
inaccurate
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
about
the
--
the
figures
with
respect
to
how
many
cases
there
were
and
so
on
and
our
executive
secretaries
office
has
given
the
--
the
correct
figures
and
i
would
like
to
give
them
to
the
court.
last
year,
we
had
6100
odd
charges
of
unfair
labor
practice
cases
filed
with
us,
6171
and
we
had
7165
petitions
for
elections
of
one
kind
or
another
file,
representation
cases
of
those.
now,
of
course,
potentially,
every
one
of
those
cases
may
be
the
subject
of
an
administrative
inquiry
into
compliance.
but
of
those
cases,
actually,
about
400
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
cases
went
to
formal
hearings
so
that
potentially
there
was
opportunity
for
litigating
in
that
particular
case,
the
question
of
officer
status.
and
that's
400
unfair
