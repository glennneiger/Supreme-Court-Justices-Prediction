chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
findling,
may
i
ask
this
question
concerning
the
rule
of
the
--
of
the
board?
could
an
interested
party
such
as
--
as
the
coca-cola
company
have
initiated
a
collateral
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
skaggs.
chief
justice
earl

oh
--
oh,
i
beg
--
chief

530a
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
a.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
skaggs,
suppose
this
provision
requiring
anti-communist
affidavits
had
been
reciprocal
and
that
--
and
that
the
employer
was
also
required
to
--
to
file
such
affidavits,
take
a
national
company
like
your
own
that
might
have
regional
managers
and
metropolitan
managers
and
--
and
city
managers,
would
you
consider
those
all
officers
of
the
corporation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
talking
about
this
sense
and
not
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
strict
sense
but
in
the
sense
of
this
case,
would
--
would
you
consider
all
of
those
officers
of
your
corporation
if
they
just
said
your
officers
must
make
affidavits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
skaggs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
may
proceed
and
we'll
finish
after
the
rise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
skagg,
what
--
what
authority
do
you
have
for
the
fact
that
while
the
--
the
board
may
have
the
authority
to
do
this
in
this
ex
parte
manner
--
manner
that
you
have
mentioned
that
if
it
does
not
do
it,
you
have
the
right
to
clutter
up
a
--
a
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
with
the
determination
with
that
matter,
with
that
issue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
take
it
that
--
that
your
suggestion
was
that
in
the
ex
parte
proceeding,
if
the
--
if
the
board
did
hold
some
kind
of
a
hearing
and
made
some
kind
of
a
--
of
a
ruling
that
you
would
be
bound
by
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
leads
me
to
--
to
this
question.
suppose
you
were
permitted
to
raise
this
in
your
unfair
labor
practice
case
and
the
board
decided
against
you,
would
that
be
res
judicata
or
could
any
other
employer
coming
along
in
any
other
unfair
labor
practice
case
relitigate
the
same
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
suppose
he
said
it's
a
functionary,
he
acted
a
little
differently
in
my
case
than
he
did
in
--
in
coca
cola's
case.
then,
would
he
be
denied
the
right
of
judicial
review
if
you
had
it
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
regardless
of
the
effectiveness
of
which
you
--
you
presented
the
matter
or
regardless
of
whether
you
--
you
put
the
same
factors
before
the
--
the
board
that
--
that
the
next
employer
claimed
were
in
his
case
maybe
instead
of
sitting
in
the
room
when
the
collective
bargaining
was
going
on.
in
the
second
case,
he
actually
took
some
part
of
it
in
it
and
then
he
would
--
they
would
claim
that
that
was
--
it
was
a
different
functionary.
do
you
think
that
you
would
be
precluded
or
the
second
man
would
be
precluded
from
litigating
that
because
you
had
done
under
one
set
of
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder,
we're
entitled
to
assume
but
because
there
was
no
formal
hearing
on
this
0subject,
i,
the
board
that
it
did
not
give
consideration
as
to
who
were
actually
officers
of
the
cio.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but,
but
that
still
doesn't
mean
that
they
didn't
make
any
investigation
because
under
their
constitutional
test,
any
one
who
is
the
constitutional
officer
or
who
has
been
left
out
through
fraud
or
deception
is
also
an
officer
in
the
eyes
of
the
board.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
--
that
the
board
did
not
look
into
that
situation
to
determine
whether
there
are
any
--
any
persons
acting
as
officers
who
were
fraudulently
concealed
as
such?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
understood
mr.
findling
to
say
that
--
that
that's
only
in
the
first
instance,
but
they
invite
suggestions
from
employers
or
from
interested
parties
or
even
from
within
the
union
that
--
that
the
facts
do
not
conform.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
findling,
would
you
mind
answering
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
and
then
i
believe
you
have
want
to
correct
some
figures
you
gave,
you
may
do
that
briefly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
had
some
formal
hearings
of
that
character?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
mr.
skaggs.
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
on
page
44?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
definitely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
