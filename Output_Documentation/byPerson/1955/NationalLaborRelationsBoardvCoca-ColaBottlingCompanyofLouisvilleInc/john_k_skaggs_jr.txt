mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
may
it
please
the
chief
justice
and
company.
i
should
like
to
--
first
to
--
so
that
i
may
proceed
to
the
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
your
honors,
i
would
first
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
this
collateral
proceeding
which
has
been
raised
here
and
the
right
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
to
avail
himself
to
that
collateral
proceeding
and
what
the
n.l.r.b.
had
to
say
about
that
and
i
read
you
from
page
530a
of
the
record.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
530a.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
as
already
stated
in
this
case,
the
respondent
did
not
attack
the
union's
compliance
in
a
collateral
administrative
proceeding
but
sought
to
raise
the
subject
at
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
in
conformance
with
the
board's
rule
set
forth
above,
the
trial
examiner
properly
refused
to
hear
evidence
thereon
and
properly
denied
the
respondent's
motions.
moreover,
had
the
respondent
proceeded
by
an
appropriate
motion
to
the
board
and
had
the
respondent
established
in
a
collateral
proceeding
what
it
had
offered
to
prove
at
the
hearing
herein.
we're
satisfied
and
find
that
under
the
board's
present
constitutional
test,
such
proof
would
fall
short
of
substantiating
the
respondent's
contention
that
taylor
was
an
officer
of
the
cio.
under
the
board's
constitutional
test,
an
officer
is
a
person
occupying
a
position
identified
as
an
officer
in
a
union's
constitution.
and
it
does
not
appear
that
taylor
is
a
person
occupying
such
a
position
in
the
current
cio
constitution
nor
does
it
appear,
as
the
respondent
states
in
its
brief,
that
the
position
of
taylor,
position
which
taylor
occupies
was
omitted
from
the
cio's
constitution
in
order
to
evade
or
circumvent
the
filing
of
the
requirements
of
section
9.
it
follows,
your
honors,
that
the
sole
purpose
for
inquiring
into
evasion
is
--
has
an
office
then
omitted
from
the
constitution
of
a
union
since
1947,
the
effective
date
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
that
is
indicated
by
the
continuing
language
used
by
the
board
in
its
opinion
at
531a,
an
examination
of
the
constitutions
of
the
cio
for
the
years
1946
through
1953
inclusive
which
covers
a
period
both
preceding
and
following
the
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act
shows
that
taylor's
position
was
never
designated
as
a
cio
officer.
accordingly,
we
reaffirmed
the
board's
determination
made
in
an
earlier
representation
case
involving
similar
issues
raised
by
the
respondent
because
there
was
a
representation
case
involving
the
same
two
parties
for
the
same
issues
in
the
record.
and
now
hold
that
the
cio
is
in
compliance
and
that
the
respondent's
contentions
with
respect
to
the
matters
--
matters
made
in
this
case
lack
merit.
so,
in
the
collateral
proceeding
and
not
just
any
--
the
board
following
and
ruling
without
exception,
we
would
have
been
wasting
our
time.
now,
what
we
did
do
and
i'm
must
amplify
mr.
findling's
statement
somewhat
as
to
what
we
did
do.
when
the
complaint
issued,
the
respondent
moved
to
dismiss
it
on
the
ground
that
it
did
not
affirmly
duly
allege,
one,
that
the
local
union,
the
international
union
and
three
of
the
cio
or
--
or
at
all
relevant
times
or
in
--
or/and
at
all
irrelevant
times
were
in
compliance
with
section
9
(f),
(g),
and
(h).
the
motion
also
alleged
his
grounds
for
dismissing
the
complaint,
the
copies
of
all
the
compliance
documents
were
relating
to
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
had
not
been
filed
as
a
part
of
the
record
in
the
case
and
furnished
to
the
respondent.
when
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
was
denied,
the
respondent
filed
an
answer
alleging
that
neither
local
20
nor
the
international
union
nor
the
cio
had
filed
or
now
have
on
file
with
the
secretary
of
labor
of
the
united
states
any
and
all
of
the
documents,
statements,
material
and
data
required
for
this
subsection
(f)
and
(g)
of
section
9
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947.
and
at
each
of
the
respective
officers
of
said
organizations
including
w.b.
taylor,
regional
director
of
the
congress
of
industrial
organizations
in
kentucky
has
not
executed
and
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
does
not
now
have
on
file
with
the
said
board,
the
affidavits
required
by
subsection
(h).
and
this
answer
went
on
to
assert
that
the
respondent
is
entitled
to
inspect
and
examine
et
cetera.
next
to
1952,
respondent
--
counsel
for
respondent
appeared
at
the
board
office
and
asked
to
examine
the
compliance
filed
through
the
three
unions.
respondent's
counsel
then
wrote
to
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
requesting
detailed
information
as
to
compliance
for
the
three
labor
organizations
with
the
three
sections
of
the
act.
and
in
reply,
the
board
furnished
the
respondent
with
the
list
of
the
names
of
the
officers
of
the
three
organizations
who
had
filed
the
non-communist
affidavits.
next,
respondent
secured
subpoenas
directed
to
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
to
its
regional
director,
requiring
them
to
produce
the
non-communist
affidavits
filed
by
the
officers
of
the
organizations.
he
likewise
issued
a
subpoena
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
requiring
him
to
produce
the
compliance
doctrine
that
was
filed
by
the
three
unions
under
section
9
(f)
--
9
(f)
and
(g)
of
the
act.
these
subpoenas
were
subsequently
revoked
by
the
trial
examiner
on
the
ground
that
the
company
was
not
entitled
to
litigate
the
union's
compliance
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
so,
i
believe
gentlemen
that
we
reasonably
well
exhausted
any
remedy
that
we
might
have
had
with
the
n.l.r.b.
and
finally,
we
turn
to
the
question
of
our
right
to
here
litigate
the
question
of
a
union's
compliance.
and
i
refer
to
the
legal
question
of
a
union's
compliance
and
not
to
the
factual
question.
we
believe
that
the
highland
park
case
settled
the
question
that
judicial
review
may
be
had
as
to
whether
and
--
or
not
a
union
is
required
to
comply.
we
believe
that
this
case
turns
upon
two
issues.
one,
a
definition
of
the
term
"officer"
as
used
in
section
9
(h)
of
the
act
and
two,
upon
the
so-called
constitutional
test
as
practiced
by
and
promulgated
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
to
consider
one
of
these
questions
is
substantially
to
consider
the
other.
and
first,
i
would
like
to
come
to
what
i
believe
is
a
conclusive
or
if
not
conclusive,
at
least
a
very
enlightening
approach
to
the
term
"officer."
it
is
true
that
we
are
construing
here
a
statute,
not
an
intention
of
congress
because
that's
a
little
difficult
to
do
but
we
may
look
--
we
may
look
to
the
expressions
of
congress
as
for
some
help
along
the
way.
according
to
our
findings
and
this
appears
substantially
on
pages
48
and
49
of
the
respondent's
brief,
the
records
of
the
discussions
of
members
of
congress
while
section
9
(h)
was
in
the
process
of
passage
indicate
that
the
term
"officer"
was
not
very
understood
in
any
narrow
or
technical
sense.
the
keynote
of
section
9
(h)
was
named
--
was
aimed
at
communist
leadership
and
to
prevent
communist
domination
in
unions.
congressmen,
in
referring
to
the
persons
to
whom
section
9
(h)
would
apply,
used
the
term
"leader"
either
alone
or
interchangeably
with
the
word
"officers."
representative
bell
stated
that
communist
must
be
--
must
have
--
that
communist
have
gotten
into
positions
of
authority
and
control.
and
he
sought
to
prevent
against
the
impending
danger
of
having
communist
in
control
of
our
great
american
labor
organization.
congressman
halleck
spoke
of
what
is
now
section
9
as
a
provision
seeking
to
deal
with
a
matter
of
communist
domination
and
leadership
in
unions.
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
determine,
there
is
not
one
instance
where
any
member
of
congress
expressly
indicated
that
the
term
"officer"
was
to
be
defined
by
reference
to
a
union's
constitution
and
indeed
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
find,
the
use
of
the
word
"officer"
in
connection
with
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
was
seldom
used
by
members
of
congress.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
that
is
undoubtedly
true,
sir.
and
i
quote
those
--
those
passages
from
the
congressional
record
primarily
to
indicate
that
the
congressmen
who
referred
to
it
sought
to
control
the
communist
leadership
at
each
and
every
level
of
the
union
movement
as
announced.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
yes.
and
very
significantly,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
promulgating
section
9
(h)
which
is
the
communist
section,
the
congress
in
enacting
its
legislation
then
uses
the
word
"officer."
i
can
only
believe
that
the
congress,
after
using
the
word
"leadership,"
"domination,"
"control,"
intended
for
the
word
"officer"
to
mean
a
person
who
is
a
leader
in
control,
making
policy
decisions
and
really
a
dominant
factor
in
the
union.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
we
had
a
kentucky
congressman
who
was
before
this
law
at
that
time
but
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
to
that
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
think
that
in
its
brief,
the
union
as
well
as
ourselves
stated
that
we
believe
that
the
term
"officer"
should
have
its
usual
and
ordinary
construction
as
given
it
in
general
everyday
terminology.
we
are
here
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
agreed
on
that.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
here
in
our
brief
that
we
do
not
believe
that
a
constitutional
test
can
possibly
rise
to
that
measure.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
we
would
suggest
what
we
have
--
what
we
have
denominated
as
a
functional
test
where
the
n.l.r.b.
may
undertake
an
inquiry
ex
parte
if
it
wished
into
the
function,
control,
leadership
of
the
persons
vested
with
authority
by
the
unions.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
sir,
of
course
that
is
the
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
that
is
the
very
meat
of
our
--
of
our
argument
here.
we
say
that
an
officer
has
been
determined
by
the
courts
of
the
country
that
it
is
purely
a
legal
determination
as
it
presently
stands.
and
i
would
quote,
your
honor,
from
the
expression
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
colby
against
klune,
178
f.2d,
where
the
court
was
defining
the
term
officers
for
the
purpose
of
section
16
(b)
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
which
section
you
will
identify
as
restricting
the
insider
profit-taking
in
corporate
stock
transactions.
and
there,
the
second
circuit
said
includes
inter
alia,
a
corporate
employee
performing
executive
duties
of
such
character
that
he
would
be
likely
in
discharging
those
duties
to
obtain
confidential
information
about
the
company's
affairs
that
would
aid
him
if
he
engaged
in
personal
market
transactions.
it
is
immaterial
how
his
functions
are
labeled
or
how
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
defined
by
the
bylaws.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
this
is
the
definition
that
the
court
gave
and
it
concluded
on
with
saying
it
is
immaterial
how
his
functions
are
labeled
or
how
defined
in
the
bylaws
or
that
he
does
or
does
not
act
under
the
supervision
of
some
other
corporate
representative.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
we
suggest
that
without
attempting
to
prescribe
the
duties
of
the
board
but
we
suggest
that
that
is
not
an
impossible
or
perhaps
even
too
great
a
problem
to
require
the
unions
themselves
to
come
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding
with
the
n.l.r.b.,
submit
the
duties
of
their
different
powerful
leaders
and
representatives
and
that
the
board
itself
may
determine
that
on
a
functional
basis
as
against,
may
i
say,
the
subdelegation
of
the
authority
delegated
to
them
by
congress.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
should
think
it
would
lead
to
that,
sir.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
i've
--
as
i
must
say
again,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
delegated
to
the
n.l.r.b.
the
functions
that
we
are
speaking
of
here.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
and
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
sir,
if
they
sought
to
define
it
on
some
specific
term,
i
would
perhaps
be
in
agreement
with
that
but
they
say
it
takes
the
ordinary
connotation
and
meaning.
that
is
the
position
that
they
take
in
their
brief
and
i
am
--
when
i
am
asked
to
say
what
the
n.l.r.b.
might
do
to
properly
define
an
officer,
i
must
go
back
to
this
court's
expression
in
the
phelps
dodge
corporation
against
national
labor
relations
board
in
313
u.s.
and
say
--
and
i'm
not
quoting
this
court.
the
board,
we
believe
sometimes
overestimates
administrative
difficulties
and
underestimates
its
administrative
resourcefulness,
and
while
it
maybe
that
this
may
cause
the
n.l.r.b.
some
trouble
and
some
difficulty
and
perhaps
more
work,
it
is
the
position
of
respondent
that
if
that
results
in
controlling
communist
leadership
and
infiltration
into
unions
at
each
and
every
level
as
announced
by
this
court
in
the
highland
park
decision
then
it
is
worth
that
and
that
they
--
if
they
do
not
have
that
time
then
they
must
take
that
time
because
the
very
keystone
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
very
keystone
of
controlling
labor
organizations
and
defending
them,
not
the
employer
but
defending
the
union
itself
from
communist
infiltration
is
section
9
(h),
requiring
the
filing
of
these
affidavits.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
in
a
strict
sense,
not
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
officers
of
the
parent.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
believe
in
--
mr.
chief
justice
in
answering
that
question.
i
would
say
to
you
that
if
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
"officer"
and
in
the
functions
in
which
that
man
were
performing,
i
would,
yes,
consider
him
an
officer
if
he
were
vested
with
policy
making
decisions
and
power
within
his
own
era.
in
our
brief,
we
pointed
out
the
walters
case
in
the
california
courts,
where
there,
a
person
who
was
in
charge
of
branch
bank
was
served
with
a
--
an
attachment.
the
court
held
there
that
he
was
an
officer
for
the
purpose
of
service
if
he
was
an
officer
such
as
to
apprise
the
institution
of
the
true
nature
of
this
thing
if,
in
effect,
it
accomplished
what
the
word
"officer,"
we
believe,
means
as
it
does
here
as
further.
as
pointed
out
in
our
brief
as
we
received
a
letter
from
the
n.l.r.b.
in
that
letter,
we
were
advised
that
the
united
brewery
workers
union
which
consists
of
some
600,
i
might
say
more
or
less,
all
time
residence.
that
is
the
very
solid
find
of
the
union.
some
600
members
and
16
officers
denominated
by
its
constitution
and
bylaws
as
being
required
to
file
non-communist
affidavits.
a
letter
further
advised
us
that
the
international
of
the
brewery
workers
union
comprising
--
i
do
not
know
how
many
members
but
consisting
of
the
brewery
workers,
soft
drink
workers,
cereal
workers,
distillery
workers
over
the
country
and
i
know
at
least
an
excess
of
200,000
filed
for
non-communist
affidavits.
the
cio,
with
some
6
million
--
6,500,000
members
have
denominated
11
purpose
--
persons
as
their
officers.
actually,
in
further
and
partial
answer
to
your
question,
that
presents
an
anomalous
situation
at
best.
and
it
leaves
open
a
question
of
as
you
refer
to
my
company,
a
national
company,
stockholders
elect
my
board
of
directors,
my
board
of
directors
in
turn
elect
or
appoint
officers.
as
apparently,
the
cio
is
setup.
its
membership
elects
officers,
it
elects
11
men,
i
take
that
from
mr.
goldberg's
statement.
the
comparison
thus
did
not
become
the
same
because
the
board
of
directors
of
a
corporation
invested
with
a
power
to
elect
the
officers,
to
remove
them,
to
appoint
them
from
time
to
time.
and
here,
we
believe
that
functional
test,
the
test
that
we
must
go
to
is
that
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
as
to
the
right
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
to
litigate
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
taylor,
regional
director,
was
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
--
an
officer
of
this
union.
the
first
time
that
this
court
looked
at
a
situation
similar
to
that
was
in
the
highland
park
case,
where
the
question
of
judicial
review
of
the
compliance
of
a
union
under
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
was
a
judge
to
be
proper
subject
of
judicial
review.
it
was
only
natural
at
following
that
the
various
courts
of
appeal
would
look
at
that
question
and
that
a
great
many
other
matters
might
be
presented
to
the
courts
for
their
consideration.
in
the
case
of
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
versus
sharples
chemical
company
from
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
it
was
there
held
that
the
veracity
of
a
non-communist
affidavit
filed
by
an
officer,
shall
we
say
a
constitutional
officer,
as
defined
by
the
n.l.r.b
might
not
be
questioned.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
position.
we
believe
that
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
should
be
able
to
judge
and
determine
the
veracity
of
such
affidavits
as
are
filed.
again,
in
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
versus
the
vulcan
manufacturing
case,
the
issue
of
the
truthfulness
of
the
affidavits
rights
or
whether
the
ostensible
officers
filing
them
are,
in
fact,
searched
by
the
union.
we
made
no
question
but
that
a
party
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
or
representative
proceeding
does
not
have
the
right
to
question
the
truthfulness
of
the
affidavits.
then,
in
american
rubber
products
corporation
against
n.
l.
r.
b.
from
the
seventh
circuit,
again,
we
find
that
the
court
notes
the
distinction
between
the
fact
of
compliance
which
it
holds
is
not
subject
to
litigation,
and
again,
distinguishes
a
necessity
of
compliance
as
a
matter
alone.
then,
we
come
to
the
two
most
recent
decisions,
the
case
that
we
have
here
which
is
on
review
from
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
a
more
subsequent
case
of
the
goodman
manufacturing
company
case
against
n.
l.
r.
b.
which
is
decided
most
recently
in
the
--
in
november
of
this
past
year
and
i'm
unable
to
furnish
a
good
citation
on
that
case,
where
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
pinpointed
and
distinguished
all
these
cases,
again
reiterating
that
whether
or
not
a
person
is
an
officer
and
incidentally
the
goodman
case
went
off
directly
on
that
point
is
subject
to
judicial
review
because
again,
the
definition
of
the
term
officer
becomes
the
whole
keystone
of
section
9
(h)
of
the
act
upon
which
depends
all
of
the
ability
of
our
country
to
control
communist
infiltrations
into
unions.
at
least,
that
may
be
given
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
with
that
before
us,
it
seems
clear
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
must
turn
its
consideration
to
the
question
of
is
the
constitutional
test
set
up
by
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
not
a
reasonable
test
because
we
do
not
think
that
but
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
reasonable
test,
we
do
not
think
that
a
reasonable
test
is
adequate
to
supply
the
demand
of
the
statute.
for
among
other
reasons,
that
the
board,
in
its
brief
here,
clearly
points
out,
and
i
refer
you
to
page
50
of
the
--
50
to
55
--
wait
a
minute,
that
is
not
correct.
i'll
have
that
in
just
a
moment.
the
board
says
that
the
definition
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
oh
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
if
this
court
should
hold,
after
holding
that
this
is
a
question
subject
to
review,
that
if
the
constitutional
test,
as
defined
by
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
is
a
proper
and
a
right
test,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
i
would
have
nothing
left
to
litigate.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
i
believe,
sir,
that
the
court
would
have
to
decide
the
first
question
favorably
to
me
before
it
would
ever
come
to
the
second
question.
if
--
if
the
question
of
questioning
compliance,
if
the
court
held
that
it
did
not
have
the
right
to
review
as
a
matter
of
law
of
the
actuality
of
compliance,
the
necessity
of
compliance
and
that
that
was
the
sole
province
of
the
n.l.r.b.,
which
of
course
would
be
in
the
very
teeth,
i
submit,
sir,
of
the
--
of
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
highland
park
case.
then
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
it
doesn't
seem
that
we
would
come
to
the
second
question.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
the
board
as
i
--
as
i
--
what
i
wish
to
make
my
position,
mr.
justice
black,
is
this.
but
while
the
courts
have
held
in
--
or
this
court
has
held
in
n.
l.
r.
b.
or
as
the
highland
park
case
which
we
refer
to,
that
the
necessity
of
actual
compliance
is
ligitable.
we
believe
that
now
that
we
are
here
on
that
question,
that
by
way
of
defining
the
future
of
the
n.
l.
r.
b.'s
purpose
is
that
it
becomes
necessary
for
the
court
to
look
upon
their
contention
that
their
constitutional
test,
namely,
the
person
to
define
in
the
constitution
of
the
union
is
the
correct
test.
i
do
not
admit,
sir,
that
it
is
a
reasonable
test
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
nor
do
i
admit
that
if
it
were
a
reasonable
test,
that
it
would
fulfill
the
requirements
laid
down
to
section
9
(h).
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
there
may
well
not
be,
sir.
i
have
not
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
not
considered
that
phrase
of
it.
we
have
turned
in
our
consideration
here
to
the
fact
that
the
board
places
a
question
and
it
urges
that
its
constitutional
test,
that
is
who
are
named
by
the
unions
by
laws
or
rather
its
constitution,
is
consistent
with
the
ordinary
and
usual
meaning
of
the
term
"officers."
now,
that
i
do
not
believe
if
the
definition
that
may
well
be
given
to
that
and
was
on
page
50
of
the
board's
brief
that
i
referred
to
that
it
admits
that
there
is
no
special
connotation
to
be
given
to
the
term
"officer"
as
it
used
in
the
labor
statute.
and
that
accordingly,
since
it
places
the
question
on
that
level,
i
believe,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
--
in
answer
to
your
question,
there
--
it
becomes
no
occasion
for
any
judicial
deference
to
be
given
to
the
board's
definition
of
the
constitutional
test
since
it
does
place
it
strictly
on
that
level
and
does
not
purport
to
attach
to
it
any
special
significance
as
being
used
in
a
labor
statute
or
in
any
special
significance
because
the
n.
l.
r.
b.,
as
a
board
constituted
under
the
act,
has
so
defined
it.
our
basis
for
that
is
when
the
words
are
used
in
their
ordinary
meaning,
their
construction
presents
solely
a
question
of
law
and
an
issue
fully
appropriate
for
the
exercise
of
--
i
--
we
believe
the
widest
scope
of
--
of
judicial
review.
and
our
authority
for
that
decision
is,
of
course,
the
great
northern
railway
against
the
merchants'
elevator
company
case
which
was
found
in
259
u.s.
and
when
this
court
has
then
found
that
congress
used
language
in
section
9
(h)
in
its
ordinary
and
accepted
sense
which
is,
of
course,
the
holding
in
the
highland
park
case,
then
it
seems
to
us,
as
the
respondent,
that
the
ruling
in
the
highland
park
--
park
case
is
inescapable
here.
and
that
the
court
judicially
must
need
to
review
the
question
of
officer
and
the
proper
definition
of
the
term
“officer”.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
term
“officer”
should
be
held
to
include
all
persons
who
are
occupying
pulls
of
leadership
in
unions
whose
duties,
responsibilities,
and
influence
in
the
union
measure
up
to
those
as
an
officer
as
that
term
is
usually
and
ordinarily
understood.
now,
i
realize
that
that
is
a
broad
definition.
i
further
confess
to
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
union
hierarchy
that
permits
me
to
be
more
definite
in
such
a
position.
but,
as
i
said
at
the
outset
here,
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
respondent
to
in
anywise
seek
to
hamper
the
operations
of
the
n.
l
.r.
b
as
an
administrative
board,
rather,
we
seek
to
have
them
take
a
real
functional
view
of
the
term
“officer”
as
it
is
used
to
conduct
real
ex
parte
hearings
into
the
persons
who
constitute
those
unions,
who
make
their
policies,
are
responsible
for
their
decisions,
their
actions,
before
it's
pointed
out
in
judge
parker
in
the
lower
court
the
same
decision
in
the
highland
park
case
is
far
more
important
that
those
officers,
that
the
officers
of
national
and
international
union
be
required
to
file
these
affidavits
than
it
is
for
the
ones
at
the
lower
level.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
sir.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
--
i've
said
that
the
respondent
would
not
object
to
the
board
conducting
its
own
hearings.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
we
believe,
sir,
that
if
the
board
would
actually
conduct
hearings
for
the
purpose
of
determining
who
are
the
officers
of
the
union
rather
than
saying
to
the
union,
“you
tell
us,
who
are
your
officers?”
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
that
that
would
eliminate
the
necessity
of
the
judicial
review.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
oh
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
do
not
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
my
reason
for
using
the
term
ex
parte
was
that
it
seems
to
me
that
ex
parte
is,
as
far
as
a
respondent
could
go
in
saying
to
a
--
an
agency
of
the
government,
if
you
conduct
a
real
inquiry
into
the
functions
of
these
particular
persons
who
are
leaders
of
the
union
and
that
is
fairly
conducted
by
you.
oh,
yes,
they
might
call
on
any
or
a
board
or
a
group
of
industry
to
participate
with
them,
but
it
seems
to
me,
if
they
were
to
undertake
the
administrative
obligation
of
actually
inquiring
who
are
the
officers
of
a
union,
what
are
their
duties,
that
they
would,
in
the
main,
fulfill
the
requirements
that
we
asked
here
because
we
definitely
assert
that
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
here
has
sub-delegated
the
power
delegated
to
it
by
congress
to
determine
who
were
the
officers
by
saying
to
the
unions
the
persons
who
are
denominated
in
your
constitution
as
being
your
officers
are
the
officers
who
must
file
these
affidavits.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
it
is
true
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
it
is
true
that
of
course
the
union,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
it
voluntarily
leaves
a
position
in
its
union
constitution
open,
it
is
true
that
if
it
omits
one,
that
the
board
may
then
order
inquiry
to
determine
into
the
(inaudible)
of
leaving
the
position
open
or
of
the
failure
to
fill
it
or
of
the
change
in
officer.
the
point
that
i
wish
to
make
is
that,
in
effect,
when
the
board
says
that
our
constitutional
test
is
in
saying
to
the
union
furnish
us
with
a
list
of
your
elected
officers
such
as
are
described
in
your
constitution
that
they
say
is
compliance
with
their
promise
under
section
9
(h).
now,
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
union
--
that
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
calls
in
the
union
and
say,
“you
tell
us
who
are
you
officers.”
i
mean
to
say
that,
in
effect,
when
they
adopt
such
a
test
and
such
a
standard,
that
that
is
the
effect
of
it,
sir.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
i
have
the
highland
park
decision
as
authority
for
that
as
well
as
the
goodman
decision
from
the
seventh
circuit.
because,
if
i
understand
the
meaning
of
those
decisions
they
hold
that,
or
else
the
other
decisions
hold
that
the
fact
of
compliance
is
something
that
may
not
be
litigated,
i.e.
the
veracity
of
an
affidavit
or
the
fact
that
it
is
actually
been
filed.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
believe
that
i'd
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
getting
away
from
it,
if
they
had
tried
to
make
an
actual
investigation.
for
instance,
sir,
if
the
--
if
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
had
held
an
investigation
of
mr.
taylor
or
if
they
had
a
finding
that
we
have
investigated
the
activities
of
mr.
w.
b.
taylor
and
we
find
that
his
duties
are
such
that
under
no
--
these
discharges
are
nothing
of
any
importance
to
this
union,
i
believe
that
i
would
have
been
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble.
the
fact
is
that
they
have
done
nothing
looking
in
that
direction.
they
have
done
nothing
to
ascertain,
is
mr.
taylor
in
the
office?
is
the
regional
director
an
officer?
who
are
the
officers?
they
have
merely
said
we
take
those
people
that
it
furnished
us
by
the
unions
as
being
their
elected
officers
and
i
suggest
to
you,
sir,
that
the
term
"elected"
is
substituted
or
rather
it
is
said
and
in
front
of
the
word
"officers."
and
we're
dealing
with
deflected
officers
that
the
board
treats.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
he
could
if
the
duties
of
the
employee
had
not
perhaps
had
change
in
the
meantime.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
that
poses
a
--
that
poses
a
question
and
i
believe
would
had
to
turn
upon
the
individual
facts
as
they
may
be
presented
in
the
particular
case.
but
in
the
absence
of
a
showing,
i
believe,
by
--
and
i
mean
a
real
showing
by
the
party,
i
do
believe
that
it
would
be
res
judicata
upon
it.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well
that
--
that
is
something
that
would
be
very
difficult
to
determine,
but
i
believe
that
i
may
answer
that
by
saying
that
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
may
well
discharge
that
function
by
conducting
a
real
hearing
into
the
functions
and
the
duties
of
the
various
labor
officers
or
persons
who
are
labor
leaders,
shall
we
say.
it
follow
--
i
make
that
statement
on
the
authority
of
the
record
in
this
case
where
it
is
set
forth
that
the
officers
named
by
the
cio
have
not
changed
in
a
period
from
1946
through
1954.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
think
that
we
are
definitely
entitled
to
assume
that,
sir,
from
the
portion
of
the
record
that
i
read
you
this
morning,
that
appearing
in
530
and
531
(a)
--
530
(a)
and
531
(a).
because,
therein,
they
state
that
even
though
the
facts
that
we
offer
to
prove
were
admittedly
true
that
under
their
constitutional
test,
mr.
taylor
would
not
have
been
an
officer.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
so
far
as
i
know,
other
than
the
admissions
contained
in
the
board's
brief
that
its
constitutional
test
consists
of
accepting
the
officers
that
are
furnished
to
get
by
the
union
as
being
its
officers
duly
elected
and
named
in
its
constitution.
so
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
a
correct
statement
only
if
it
appears
that
the
name
of
an
officer,
or
we'll
say
the
position
of
an
officer
defining
the
constitution
has
been
changed
or
has
been
left
vacant.
the
n.
l.
r.
b.
then
may
inquire
as
to
why
that
officer
was
not
elected
or
why
that
office
was
left
vacant.
now,
i
believe
that
those
are
the
only
two
instances
on
which
the
board
undertakes
such
an
inquiry
or
where
they
will
listen
to
a
party
litigant.
now,
the
board
may,
upon
its
own
volition
do
that,
i
believe
that
anytime,
in
connection
with
any
representation
or
any
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding,
but
it
would
not
be
open
to
an
employer
to
question
their
point.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
i
can
make
no
question
about
mr.
taylor.
personally,
he
only
performed
a
very
important
function
as
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
--
of
the
board.
he
has
--
he
had
89
local
unions
in
the
state
of
kentucky
under
his
jurisdiction.
we
offer
to
prove
that
he
swayed
and
made
policy
for
those
unions.
we
offered
to
prove
that
he
sat
in
their
conferences,
that
he
said
in
the
conferences
in
connection
with
this
--
with
the
representation
case
which
the
board
refers
to
in
this
record
and
that
he
actually
was
a
person
of
prominence
in
the
union
and
a
person
exercising
powers
and
controls
in
the
union
which
we
believe
come
under
our
definition
of
officers
with
the
board.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
believe
that
a
lot
of
top
sergeants
are
officers
[laughter]
and
perhaps
is
better
than
some
others
[laughs].
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
mr.
justice
reed,
at
the
--
prior
to
the
--
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
unfair
labor
practices
case
which
is
the
one
that
we
are
hereon,
this
same
union
filed
a
petition
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
that
--
that
an
election
be
held
for
the
purpose
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
only
to
who
should
take
part
in
the
election.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
and
they
sought
to
be
designated
the
bargaining
representative.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
only
that
the
--
that
we
raised
the
same
issue
concerning
mr.
taylor
and
the
representation
hearing
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
--
and
the
board
ruled
the
same
way
that
they
ruled
here.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
may
i
--
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
may
i
call
the
attention
to
one
typographical
error
in
our
brief,
appeared
at
page
44.
mr.
john
k.
skaggs,
jr.
somehow
or
another,
we
failed
to
get
in
the
word
following
the
definition
should
we
apply
in
the
correct
definition
to
the
term
"officer"
appearing
in
section
9
(h)
as
against

mr.
john
k.

to
the
claim.
