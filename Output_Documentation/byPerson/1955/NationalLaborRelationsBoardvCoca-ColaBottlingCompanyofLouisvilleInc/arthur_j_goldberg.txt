mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
i
interrupt
just
for
a
moment,
your
honor?
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
we
weren't
allowed
some
time
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
the
honor
to
appear
for
the
american
federation
of
labor
and
congress
of
industrial
organizations,
as
amicus
curiae,
and
the
board
has
been
kind
enough
to
permit
me
10
minutes
of
their
time
to
present
the
views
of
the
af
of
l-cio
in
connection
with
this
very
important
matter
which
is
before
the
court.
the
permission
was
originally
granted
to
the
cio
but
since
permission
was
granted,
the
cio
has
merged
wit
the
af
of
l
and
i
now
appear
for
the
af
of
l-cio.
there
are
several
things
i
would
like
to
present
to
the
court
in
this
short
time
that
i
have
at
my
disposal.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
court
that
congress
has
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at
this
problem
and
to
review
the
construction
placed
upon
the
compliance
situation
by
the
labor
board.
and
the
action
of
congress,
i
think,
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
construction
placed
upon
the
labor
board
that
these
matters
are
not
reviewable
in
board
proceedings
on
unfair
labor
practices
or
representation
proceedings
or
that
--
that
the
constitutional
test
of
an
officer
that
the
board
has
adopted
whether
a
man
is
named
in
the
constitution
as
an
officer
is
an
appropriate
test,
is
a
proper
test.
an
amendment
was
offered
before
the
congress
to
enlarge
the
scope
of
the
test
made
by
the
board
in
applying
the
rule
of
compliance.
that
amendment
was
offered
in
1949
when
the
senate
considered
a
bill
which
would
have
enlarged
the
scope
of
what
an
officer
is
beyond
a
constitutional
officer.
two
and
i
refer
to
page
58
of
the
board
brief
to
the
members
of
all
policy
forming
and
governing
bodies
of
the
labor
organization
as
well
as
those
designated
by
such,
by
the
constitution
of
the
labor
organization.
that's
the
test
that
the
board
has
been
using.
now,
that
bill
was
passed
by
the
senate
but
never
acted
upon
by
the
house.
and
if
we
can
consider
therefore
what
congress
did
in
light
of
the
action
that
the
board
has
been
taking,
we
can
say
that
congress,
by
failing
to
amend
the
taft-hartley
act,
has
therefore
acquiesced
in
the
determination
that
the
board
has
made
with
respect
to
the
interpretation.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
constitution.
that
is
the
test
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
the
test
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
virtually,
the
exact
words
the
board
has
added
an
additional
test
and
that
is
if
an
office
is
omitted
to
evade
the
test
made
by
the
board
and
if
an
officer
is
removed
by
a
communist
union
for
example.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
they
can
look
behind.
now,
therefore,
i
would
say
that
we
have
a
congressional
action
or
in
action
which
sheds
light
upon
this
particular
problem.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
merely
it
will.
they
took
in
light
the
action
taken
and
we
have
this
particular
matter
which
now
sheds
light
upon
this
decision.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
highland
park
did
not
--
all
highland
park
said,
very
--
by
very
specific
terms
was
this.
we
will
pass
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
necessity
for
filing
affidavits
on
the
part
of
the
cio.
we
will
not
pass
nor
do
we
think,
as
i
read
the
decision,
nor
do
we
think
inappropriate
to
pass
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
on
whether
in
fact
there
has
been
compliance.
all
we
passed
upon
is
the
necessity
by
the
labor
organization
for
compliance.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
judicial
review.
but
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
that's
correct.
but
there
was
language
in
the
decision
which
then
said,
“we
are
not
saying,
however,
that
subject
to
judicial
review
is
the
question
of
whether
in
fact
a
labor
organization
held
to
be
such
has
filed
a
proper
number
of
affidavits
whether
the
affidavits
are
accurate.
these
are
matters
that
we
leave
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
to
the
board.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
action
of
the
congress
is
a
recognition
--
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
correct.
except
that
the
--
that
the
court
in
highland
park
case
displayed
a
reluctance
to
enter
into
that
area
saying
that
we
are
not,
by
our
decision,
entering
into
that
very
complicated
area.
and
how
complicated
the
area
is,
i
indicate
in
the
brief
amicus
that
we
filed,
when
i
indicate
on
page
9
of
the
--
of
our
brief,
brief
amicus,
the
green
brief,
the
varying
list
of
assignments
held
by
the
very
individual
that
the
company
is
contending
as
a
cio
officer.
and
this
cio
officer,
who
is
running
our
affairs,
who
is
determining
policy,
who
is
directing
the
activities
of
all
of
the
cio
unions
in
the
state
of
kentucky
is
now
an
employee
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
indonesia,
running
some
office
or
some
function
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
indonesia.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
correct.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
comment
on
two
other
things.
i
don't
think
that
the
company's
offer
of
proof,
taken
for
everything
it's
worth,
indicates
that
this
man
is
an
officer
of
the
cio.
and
i
would
like
to
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
the
offer
of
proof
which
appears
on
page
389a
of
the
record,
in
which
the
company
says
in
effect,
388a
and
389a.
in
which
the
company
in
effect
says
that
as
regional
director
of
congress
of
industrial
organizations,
w.b.
taylor
is
charged
with
the
administrative
and
executive
duties
and
powers
over
local
20
of
the
brewery
workers
union,
the
charging
union
in
this
case.
now,
that
was
the
total
sum
of
the
offer
of
proof
made
by
the
company
except
for
the
fact
that
mr.
taylor
appeared
at
the
labor
board
hearing.
and
i
say
that
that
does
not
make
mr.
taylor,
even
under
the
company's
designation
of
his
duties,
an
officer
of
the
cio.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
did
not.
he
just
appeared
at
the
board
hearing.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
was
there.
now,
i
read
carefully
the
record,
every
page
of
it
and
the
record
doesn't
show
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
organization
of
these
particular
employees
at
coca-cola.
and
this
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
purpose
of
injecting
this
issue
into
this
case
is
the
delay,
the
disposition
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
now,
what
we
are
concerned
about,
your
honor,
not
only
as
a
cio
because
the
effect
of
a
decision
under
the
highland
park
case
of
holding
that
taylor
was
an
officer
and
did
not
comply,
would
be
to
throw
into
jeopardy
all
of
our
representation
cases
and
all
of
our
unfair
labor
practice
cases
but
the
effect
of
this
now
that
we
have
a
combined
labor
movement
is
to
take
a
man
who
was
the
staff
man.
and
because
of
the
failure
of
obviously
a
staff
man,
they
are
not
an
official
of
the
union,
it
would
be
to
jeopardize
the
compliance
status
not
only
of
the
cio
and
that's
not
so
important
because
we're
not
a
union
and
here
we
go
back
to
the
highland
park
case
where,
unfortunately,
we
did
not
argue
but
we
would
have
tried
to
argue
that
we're
not
a
union,
we're
a
federation.
but
the
af
of
l-cio,
which
is
much
larger,
is
to
throw
into
jeopardy
the
compliance
status
of
all
of
our
international
unions
that
are
--
are
affiliated.
and
there
are
--
because
there
are
regional
directors
of
the
af
of
l
too
and
of
the
af
of
l-cio,
some
--
and
that
would
encompass
some
130
or
140
international
unions
and
several
thousand
local
unions
affiliated
with
the
international
unions,
and
that
creates
our
grave
concern.
i'd
like
to
point
out
something
else
to
the
court.
the
company
gives
a
statement
of
what
they
indicate
in
their
brief
on
a
basis
of
an
article
that
they
read
from
the
cio
news,
which
was
reprinted
in
a
--
in
a
book,
indicates
what
a
regional
director
does.
it's
on
page
56
and
57
of
the
company's
brief.
now,
i
ask
your
honors
to
read
that.
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that
the
company's
own
description
of
what
a
regional
director
does
doesn't
make
a
regional
director
an
officer
of
the
cio.
that
makes
him
a
functionary,
that
makes
him
a
staff
man
and
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
as
counsel
that
a
functionary,
in
this
--
in
my
own
case
a
legal
functionary,
exercises
important
functions.
i
would
hope
that
i
do
but
i
would
be
the
first
to
admit
to
this
court
that
i'm
not
an
officer
of
the
cio
and
i
have
not
yet
been
advised
by
mr.
(inaudible)
that
i'm
an
officer
of
the
af
of
l-cio
and
i
don't
think
i
ever
will
be.
i
may
be
advised
that
i
am
one
of
the
counsel
for
the
af
of
l-cio.
now,
i
--
i
think
that's
important
to
know
that
because
i
think
what
is
basic
here
is
an
attempt
to
say
that
an
important
staff
functionary
is
an
officer
of
a
labor
organization.
that's
not
what
congress
said.
now,
there's
another
important
thing
which
i
think
the
court
ought
to
know,
which
is
found
in
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
on
the
record
on
page
530a
and
531a.
the
constitution
of
the
cio
has
never
been
changed,
was
never
changed
from
before
the
taft-hartley
act
until
now
in
reference
to
the
functions
of
a
regional
director.
in
fact,
this
officer,
this
so-called
important
officer
was
never
mentioned
in
the
cio
constitution,
he's
never
mentioned.
the
facts
are
that
the
number
of
these
people
was
summarily
changed
by
decision
of
the
officers
from
the
time
of
this
case
in
1951
until
1953.
there
were
some
40
regional
directors
in
1951
and
in
1953,
it
was
decided
by
the
officers
that
there
ought
to
be
30.
now,
i
ask
the
court
this
question.
what
kind
of
an
officer
is
it
that
you
ought
to
concern
yourself
with
to
determine
whether
there
is
compliance?
what
kind
of
an
officer
is
it?
when
the
officers
of
the
organization,
by
a
summary
decision
without
reference
to
the
electorate,
without
reference
to
conventions,
the
supreme
body
can
decide,
“well,
there
are
too
many
of
you,
we'll
send
you
away,
we'll
dismiss
you,
we'll
assign
you
to
other
jobs.”
what
kind
of
an
office
is
that?
and
i
undertake
the
proposition
that
that
is
no
office
at
all.
and
finally,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
one
final
thought
and
that
is
this.
that
if
it
is
permitted,
to
mitigate
the
employment
status
of
mr.
taylor
in
this
type
of
proceeding,
if
it's
permitted,
there'll
never
be
an
end
to
labor
board
proceedings
and
this
is
our
concern.
it
is
our
concern
because
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
end
even
at
the
present
time
without
this
problem
being
litigated.
this
case,
the
complaint
was
filed
in
1951.
it
is
now
1956
and
if
we
determine
in
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
or
in
board
proceeding,
what
every
functionary
did
as
the
sixth
circuit
indicates
in
its
decision,
we
would
never
get
through.
and
i
would
say
this
that
neither
the
board
nor
the
respondent
seems
to
understand
what
a
labor
federation
is
but
the
board
unfortunately
in
its
case
--
in
its
brief
says
that
the
cio
is
affiliated
with
17
international
unions
and
88
local
unions
in
kentucky.
that
is
not
true.
we
have
certainly
international
unions
affiliated
with
the
cio.
cio
is
not
affiliated
with
them.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
therefore,
your
honor,
that
this
case
represents
a
reductio
ad
absurdum
of
bringing
in
something
that
congress
never
could
have
intended.
mr.
arthur
j.
goldberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
