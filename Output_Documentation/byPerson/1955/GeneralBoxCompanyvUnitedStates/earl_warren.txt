then
your
--
then
your
statute
provide
that
improvements
built
on
that
batture
may
be
destroyed
at
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
expense
of
the
owner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can
understand
--
i
can
understand
that
but
where
--
where
is
the
procedure
required
to
do
what
you
have
just
said
in
relation
to
this
statute
which
says
--
says
that
they
may
--
not
that
they
may
--
may
be
moved
but
it
says
they
may
be
destroyed
at
the
expense
of
those
who
claim
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case
is
closest
in
point
to
--
to
this
thing
you're
talking
about
at
the
moment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
that
test
been
set
forth
in
any
--
any
case
that
involved
this
levee
lands
and
the
constitution
of
louisiana
as
we
have
it
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
is
the
case
that
holds
that
they
cannot
do
it
except
through
a
reasonable
procedure
under
louisiana
law?
that's
the
case
that
i'd
like
to
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
did
that
case
have
to
do
with
--
with
notice
or
--
or
the
procedure
that
was
involved
in
the
case
or
did
it
--
that
it
involves
some
other
power
of
the
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
procedure
of
any
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
it
your
position
that
--
that
there
are
no
cases
in
louisiana
to
the
contrary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
position
that
you
are
now
stating.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
asked
you
these
questions,
it
would
be
very
easy
for
me
to
agree
with
you
if
i
could
find
a
louisiana
case
which
said
that
was
the
law
of
louisiana.
that's
the
reason
why
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
we
can
take
more
or
less
as
a
matter
of
first
impression?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hill.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hill,
just
a
manner
of
interest.
does
the
assessed
evaluation
of
this
property
reflect
the
servitude,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
the
only
basis
on
which
they
could
do
it
that
it
was
cheaper?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
they
just
took
them
down
in
that
manner
because
the
government
wanted
to
take
them
down
in
that
manner
and
they
could
have
done
it
the
other
way,
would
that
been
a
breach
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
know
of
no
authority
on
that
subject,
mr.
hill?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
after
that?
was
it
before
they
started
to
remove
this
timber?
chief
justice
earl
warren
july
1st
was
the
date
you
say
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
june
12th?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
element
of
emergency
in
this
matter
or
was
this
a
normal
flood
control
project
that
you
applied
for
years
to
get
through
congress
and
finally
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
recall
how
--
about
how
long
a
period
that
would
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
were
visions
of
--
in
which
they
had
to
do
the
work?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
be
approximately
when?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
--
it
isn't
very
important
anyway,
but
i
just
thought
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
the
state
of
louisiana
had
the
right,
mr.
barnett,
to
have
this
done
and
it
conveyed
that
right
to
the
federal
government,
why
wouldn't
the
federal
government
have
the
right
to
do
it
without
regard
to
--
to
taking
anybody
else's
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
assuming
that
--
that
the
state
of
louisiana
had
the
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
say
they
didn't,
but
i
--
i
say
assume
--
assuming
that
they
did
then
the
united
states
is
not
the
(inaudible),
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
the
state
of
louisiana
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
the
box
company
said
it
--
it
will
take
us
two
or
three
years
to
log
off
this
--
this
land
and
the
government
said,
"oh,
we
have
to
have
it
done
by
the
next
flood
season."
what
would
be
the
situation
then
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
two
or
three
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
would
it
take
in
a
company
normally
to
--
to
log
off
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
haven't

mr.
