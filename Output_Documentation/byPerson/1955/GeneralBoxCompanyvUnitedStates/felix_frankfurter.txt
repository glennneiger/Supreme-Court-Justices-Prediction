for
what?
claim
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
what?
of
the
land?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you're
answer
if
i
understood
you
correctly
a
minute
ago
that
if
that
was
so,
you
would
leave
without
a
claim.
if
the
court
of
appeals
precludes
that
state
law
of
appropriation
was
followed.
if
that
was
so
then
you
would
have
no
standing
here,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
would
be
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
paper.
that
was
--
that's
not
a
taking,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
claim
--
your
essential
claim
is
that
in
doing
so
without
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
save
--
to
salvage
the
trees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
to
be
--
and
therefore
you
challenge
it,
the
court
of
claims
concluded
that
the
state
law
of
appropriation
wasn't
(inaudible)

felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask,
was
that
a
conclusion
of
law
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
fact
and
that
finding
was
in
your
favor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
finding
was
baseless?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
that
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
the
only
--
he
was
the
only
louisiana
judge
on
the
court
of
--
in
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
is
protecting
that
position,
not
as
a
matter
of
law
but
as
a
matter
of
position
in
his
amicus
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i'm
--
not
any
judgment,
but
he's
--
he's
maintaining
the
legal
position
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
louisiana
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
liability
of
louisiana
as
a
matter
