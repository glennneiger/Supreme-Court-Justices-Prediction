mr.
ross
r.
barnett
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
no
dispute
here
about
the
ownership
of
the
timber.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
united
states
government
had
a
right
to
work
on
its
levee.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
united
states
government
had
a
right
to
enlarge
its
levee.
but
if
your
honors
please,
our
contention
is
that
the
united
states
government
does
not
have
a
right
to
arbitrarily
go
on
another's
property
and
destroy
that
property
when
it
had
plenty
of
time
in
which
to
notify
the
property
owner.
and
in
this
instance,
the
record
show
that
there
was
no
opportunity
for
this
property
to
be
assessed
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
to
be
assessed
to
the
box
company.
this
property
was
purchased,
if
the
court
please,
in
1946,
one
tract
of
land.
the
other
tract
of
land
was
purchased
in
1946,
i
believe
only
a
few
weeks
after
the
first
purchase.
now,
i'm
not
a
louisiana
lawyer
and
there's
a
lot
of
law
in
louisiana
that
i
frankly
don't
know.
but
if
your
honors
please,
the
slightest
investigation
here
would
have
revealed
that
the
box
company
had
purchased
all
of
this
timber,
valuable
timber,
timber
on
260
acres
of
land.
the
deed
had
been
recorded
where
the
box
company
had
purchased
all
of
this
timber
from
a
veneer
company
of
matthews,
mississippi.
and
we
contend,
may
it
please
your
honors,
that
there
was
no
emergency
whatsoever.
you'll
see
from
the
record
that
the
--
the
negotiations
began
in
may.
the
work
actually
began
july
the
22nd,
as
one
of
your
honors
pointed
out.
now,
the
property
owner
was
never
notified.
the
landowners
were
not
notified,
if
your
honors
please,
until
sometime
in
october.
and
that
was
at
a
time
when
practically
all
of
the
timber
had
been
destroyed.
now,
when
the
box
company,
the
appellant
here,
learned
that
the
united
states
government,
through
its
contractors,
was
destroying
the
valuable
timber
which
it
had
purchased
and
which
it
owned
at
that
time,
sent
its
superintendent,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
september
the
12th,
the
record
shows.
and
the
superintendent
urged
the
contractors
to
permit
the
superintendent
of
the
box
company
and
its
employees
to
go
ahead
of
the
bulldozers
and
move
the
timber,
to
cut
the
timber
and
to
remove
the
timber.
but
the
answer
that
the
box
company
superintendent
received
was
that
the
contractors
for
the
united
states
government
had
a
contract
to
remove
the
trees
and
not
to
remove
stumps.
that
it
would
be
more
expensive
for
the
contractors
and
the
united
states
government
to
remove
stumps
than
it
would
to
remove
the
trees.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
record
doesn't
show
here
where
there
was
any
emergency
whatever.
it
wasn't
building
a
levee.
it
wasn't
a
situation
where
the
levee
had
broken
by
high
waters.
it
was
just
enlarging
the
levee.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
if
the
government
position
is
correct
in
this
case,
it
would
allow
the
united
states
government
to
do
indirectly
what
it
cannot
possibly
do
directly
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
taking
process,
taking
property
without
compensating
the
owners
for
that
property.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
if
your
honor
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
the
state
--
yes,
sir.
if
your
honor
please,
the
state
of
louisiana
didn't
have
a
right
to
destroy
the
property.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
i
think
the
state
of
louisiana
had
a
--
it
had
a
right
to
--
to
say
to
the
government
there's
a
right-of-way.
but
i
think
--
i
think
the
government's
rights
to
stop
there
where
the
rights
of
property
owners
began.
they
had
the
liberty,
if
your
honor
please,
to
go
and
do
what
the
state
of
louisiana
said
they
had
a
right
to
do,
"you
got
a
right
to
go
here
and
build
your
levee."
they
had
the
liberty
to
do
that
but,
if
your
honor
please,
their
liberty
ended
right
there
where
the
rights
of
this
box
company
began.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
they
can't
take
the
property
of
the
box
company
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
would
have
been
an
unreasonable
time.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
i
think
it
would
have
been
unreasonable.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
i
think
the
reasonable
is
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
say
that
these
--
these
logs
could
have
all
been
removed
within
two
to
three
weeks
time.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
i
put
(inaudible)
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
i
move
them
out
of
the
swamps
in
mississippi.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
and
i
believe
that
this
timber
valued
at
$10,801.
by
judge
dawkins,
could
have
actually
been
removed
easily
within
a
very
short
period
of
time.
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
no,
sir.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
no,
sir,
i
don't
agree
that
that's
the
law
of
louisiana
because
if
your
honors
pleases,
justice
black,
there
was
no
opportunity
here
for
the
property
to
be
assessed.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
well,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
--
i
think
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
i
think
the
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
i
think
the
constitution
of
louisiana
is
superior
to
--
if
that's
a
statute,
i'm
not
familiar
with
a
lot
of
the
louisiana
law
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
--
because
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
the
constitution
of
louisiana
says
that
no
man
shall
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
i
think
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution,
if
your
honor
please,
is
certainly
superior
to
any
louisiana
law.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
yes,
sir.
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
and
we
say,
if
the
court
please,
that
under
the
fifth
amendment,
regardless
of
what
the
law
in
louisiana
is,
certainly
they
would
be
entitled
to
--
to
fair
compensation
for
this
trouble.
in
other
words,
the
government
cannot
circumvent,
if
your
honor
please,
their
fate
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
as
justice
cameron
said,
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
ross
r.
barnett
yes,
sir.
justice
--
your
honor,
justice
cameron
said
this,
the
result
attending
the
reversal
of
this
judgment
on
the
--
the
majority
of
opinion
is
a
harsh
result.
and
here's
a
question
that
justice
cameron
of
the
fifth
circuit
asked,
"can
the
united
states
government
without
just
compensation
confiscate
and
destroy
for
its
own
monetary
gain
the
valuable
timber
of
appellee
growing
on
the
land
of
others
basing
its
rights
so
to
do
on
the
claim
that
the
lands
are
batture
when
state
authorities
have
taken
no
official
action
and
made
no
minute
entry
towards
exercising
the
servitude
against
the
land
or
the
timber
and
have
taken
no
steps
at
all
to
that
end
beyond
giving
written
notice
to
the
landowners?"
and
that
was
not
given,
if
your
honors
please,
until
the
timber
was
practically
all
destroyed
and
no
notice
was
ever
given
to
the
owner
of
this
timber.
thank
you.
