mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
may
it
please
the
court.
this
--
the
subject
matter
of
this
case
relates
to
a
very
basic
principle
in
the
body
of
law
which
louisiana
has
developed
to
protect
its
citizens
and
property
from
destruction
by
the
flood
waters
of
that
state.
that
first
and
basic
principle
as
has
been
discussed
here
is
that
the
state
owns
a
servitude
or
easement
for
levee
purposes
on
all
repair
in
--
land
repair
into
its
navigable
rivers.
now,
petitioner
concedes
that
servitude
but
seeks
to
deny
its
force
and
effectiveness
by
imposing
legal
limitations
upon
it
which
we
insist
are
not
required
and
that
there
is
no
authority
for.
therefore,
to
meet
that
it's
necessary
--
necessary
for
me
very
briefly
to
review
the
origin
and
the
scope
and
the
source
of
the
power
and
the
compensability
of
that
servitude.
the
servitude
commenced
in
actions
of
the
french
crown
in
reserving
the
servitude
from
grants
of
property
given
in
this
french
crown
colony.
it
was
carried
on
through
the
reign
of
spain
and
by
express
code
provisions
during
territorial
status
and
currently
during
statehood.
the
scope
and
extent
has
been
judicially
defined
to
include
all
property
which
is
within
the
range
of
the
reasonable
necessity
of
the
situation
as
produced
by
the
forces
of
nature.
it
includes
lands,
improvements,
crops
and
trees.
now,
the
power
--
the
source
of
the
power
of
the
servitude
is
not
eminent
domain.
that
is
the
taking
from
another,
exercising
the
state's
paramount
domain.
in
louisiana,
as
elsewhere,
exercise
of
eminent
domain
would
require
just
compensation.
the
state
calls
that
power
expropriation.
that's
eminent
domain,
it
calls
expropriation.
it
calls
the
exercise
of
this
levee
servitude
and
appropriation.
that
is
it
appropriates
to
its
own
use
property
which
already
belongs
to
it.
that's
the
source
of
the
power,
ownership,
not
eminent
domain.
now,
prior
to
1921
with
the
exception
of
an
1898
act
authorizing
payment
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
prior
to
1921,
no
compensation
was
ever
allowed
for
the
exercise
of
this
--
of
this
property
--
of
this
property
right
or
servitude.
in
1921,
the
louisiana
constitution
was
revised
and
a
limited
gratuity
was
given
to
riparian
owners
for
the
exercise
of
this
servitude.
they
were
allowed
the
assessed
value
for
the
preceding
year
for
their
--
for
their
lands
or
improvement
actually
used
or
destroyed
for
levees.
but
that
revision
of
the
constitution
in
1921
expressly
provided
that
this
shall
not
include
batture.
batture
is
the
land
for
this
purpose
that
lies
between
the
levee
and
the
river
wherever
the
levee
may
be
located.
the
petitioner
concedes
that
the
--
that
the
land
on
which
its
timber
stood
is
batture
but
avoids
all
of
that
law
regarding
the
servitude
by
challenging
the
procedure
used
to
exercise
it.
specifically,
that
there
was
no
notice
--
advanced
notice
or
advanced
hearing
accordingly
and
by
challenging
the
reasonableness
of
using
it
to
reduce
the
cost
of
the
project.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
i
should
think
it
well
could.
i
don't
know
as
a
matter
of
practice.
i'm
just
not
that
familiar
with
louisiana
law.
now,
insistence
on
notice
overlooks
the
plain
and
valid
distinction
between
expropriation
and
appropriation
in
louisiana
law.
the
louisiana
constitution
requires
for
the
exercise
of
eminent
domain,
that
is
expropriation,
that
compensation
be
ascertained
and
paid
--
be
paid
in
advance.
that
would
require
an
advanced
notice
of
course
and
an
advanced
hearing,
but
this
is
not
an
expropriation.
there
is
no
requirement
in
louisiana
law
requiring
advanced
notice
or
hearing
for
the
use
by
the
state
of
what
it
already
owns.
for
example,
in
dickson
versus
board
of
commissioners
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
it
was
said,
"in
louisiana
the
state
has
the
right
to
act
first.
that
is
the
authority
to
appropriate
such
land
to
a
use
to
which
it
is
subject
under
its
very
title
and
talk
later."
in
pruyn
versus
nelson
brothers,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
said,
"the
law
does
not
provide
that
the
administrative
officers
shall
follow
any
particular
procedure
in
exercising
the
servitude.
the
customary
way
is
to
delegate
to
the
contractor
the
right
to
remove
the
soil
from
the
batture."
therefore,
we
maintain
that
no
notice
is
required.if
the
riparian
owner
desires
to
challenge
the
reasonableness
of
the
use,
he
may
do
so
by
suing
the
levee
board
subsequently.
now,
the
question
has
been
raised
so
repeatedly
whether
there
are
any
louisiana
decisions
which
say
notice
is
not
required.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
your
honor,
all
of
these
--
almost
by
titles,
all
of
these,
the
state
decisions
are
an
aggrieved
riparian
owner
suing
the
levee
board
for
what
is
alleged
to
be
an
unreasonable
use
of
his
land.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
such
as
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
such
as
this.
although,
by
the
theory
of
the
case
which
petitioner
makes,
he
sued
the
united
states
believing
that
the
servitude
had
--
had
not
been
effectively
appropriated
by
the
state
and
was
a
direct
taking
by
the
united
states.
but
--
but
for
his
theory,
in
that
respect,
he
had
had
--
would
have
had
a
cause
of
action
and
does
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
levee
board
to
--
to
litigate
the
reasonableness
of
the
use
of
the
servitude.
now,
the
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
the
united
states
brought
the
levee
board
in
as
a
third
party
defendant.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
well,
if
he
prevails
here,
of
course,
he'll
get
it
from
the
united
states
and
we
might
get
it
from
the
levee
board.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
would
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
--
bar
his
action
against
the
levee
board.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
well,
that
would
be
a
question
of
whether
the
fact
that
the
levee
board
being
in
this
suit
indirectly
would
bar
him.
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
the
district
court
in
its
decision
on
rehearing
held
that
the
united
states
alone
is
liable
and
it
may
not
recover
over
against
the
levee
board.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
we
--
we
believe
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
it
did
not
reach
the
question.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
the
--
the
case
that
--
that
petitioner
might
bring
against
the
levee
board?
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
yes,
your
honor.
we
appealed,
the
--
the
government
appealed.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
no,
the
question
was
not
reached
because
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
i
believe
the
district
--
i
believe
the
district
court
held
that
the
levee
board
would
not
be
liable
to
the
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
no,
that
was
not
appealed
by
the
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
well,
my
understanding
of
the
--
the
purpose
for
the
amicus
brief
was
to
protect
the
--
the
principle
that's
involved.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
that
--
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
no,
the
box
company
sued
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
brought
the
levee
board
in
as
a
third
party
defendant.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
well,
the
united
states
is
--
is
in
opposition
to
the
box
company.
the
box
company
has
sued
the
united
states
and
one
or
the
other
must
win.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
the
district
court
held
the
united
states
may
not
recover
against
the
levee
board,
that's
correct.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
the
united
states
took
a
full
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
servitude
had
been
properly
exercised
and
that
the
united
states
was
not
directly
or
indirectly
liable.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
the
--
the
box
company
did
not,
no.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
that's
correct
in
the
event
that
we
were
adjudged
liable.
now,
on
the
question
of
--
well,
i
had
almost
concluded
discussing
notice
except
for
this
one
statement.
the
question
has
been
asked
several
times.
are
there
any
state
of
louisiana
decisions
in
which
it
has
been
held
that
notice
is
not
required
in
this
particular?
well,
there
are
two
decisions
cited
in
the
government's
brief.
the
first
one
is
the
scott
versus
red
river-bayou
pierre
levee
district,
which
is
not
cited
squarely
for
that
purpose
but
it's
in
the
case.
in
that
case,
the
complaining
riparian
owner
said
that
her
land
had
been
taken
and
i
quote,
â€œwithout
her
knowledge,
without
any
--
without
my
knowledge
and
consent."
and
the
ultimate
decision
in
that
case
was
that
she
had
no
--
no
claim
to
any
compensation
whatsoever
for
exercise
of
this
servitude.
and
the
second
case
is
the
pruyn
case,
which
my
opponent
has
discussed
and
acknowledged,
it
relates
to
the
notice
question.
that's
the
case
in
which
they
said
the
customary
practice
is
for
the
contractor
to
delegate
the
servitude
or
the
right
to
the
contractor
to
enter
directly
on
the
property
and
remove
the
soil
from
the
batture.
that
was
the
answer
to
the
--
to
the
notice
question
in
that
case.
now,
as
to
the
right
to
an
advanced
hearing,
i
have
--
i
have
pointed
out,
i
believe,
that
there
is
no
right
to
an
advanced
hearing
as
there
would
be
if
this
were
an
expropriation
under
louisiana
law.
the
federal
constitution
does
not
require
an
advanced
hearing
even
in
the
case
of
the
exercise
that
they
followed
eminent
domain.but
in
this
case,
for
example,
petitioner
was
accorded
a
hearing,
of
course,
by
this
very
suit
and
the
only
basis
for
his
challenge
that
the
use
of
the
servitude
was
not
reasonable
is
his
charge
that
the
property,
the
trees
were
not
actually
used
in
constructing
the
levee
and
that
is
true.
but
they
were
--
and
--
and
he
urges
that
the
government's
defense
that
the
--
that
the
trees
were
destroyed
in
this
manner
and
as
a
means
of
reducing
the
cost
of
the
project,
he
maintains
is
not
a
reasonable
use
or
we
maintain
and
we
believe
we're
supported
by
decisions
of
this
court,
united
states
ex
rel.
tva
versus
welch
in
--
in
327
u.s.
and
old
dominion
company
versus
united
states
in
269
u.s.,
that
cost
is
an
important
element
in
any
government
project
and
that
the
government
like
anyone
else
does
not
have
to
proceed
with
this
project
oblivious
to
cost.
it's
an
ingredient
in
--
in
the
project.
this
--
this
timber
was
not
destroyed
for
no
reason.
it
was
not
destroyed
in
this
way
for
no
reason.it
was
destroyed
in
this
way
to
cheapen
the
cost
of
the
project.
they
--
practically
speaking,
this
is
what
occurred,
if
the
bulldozer
--
if
--
if
the
petitioner
had
been
allowed
to
go
in
there
and
cut
these
trees
down
and
use
them,
it
would
have
left
low-lying
stumps.
that
is
a
far
more
expensive
way
--
that
it
is
far
more
expensive
to
remove
stumps
of
that
kind
by
bulldozers
and
blasting
than
it
is
to
what
they
call
walk
the
tree
down
by
a
tree-dozer.
it
would
have
nearly
doubled
the
cost
of
that
clearing
as
this
record
shows.
and
we
maintain
that
is
an
important
element
in
the
project
and
that
the
servitude
was
exercised
or
that
the
trees
were
destroyed
by
that
reason
in
the
proper
exercise
of
the
servitude.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
or
if
they
were
going
to
use
the
trees?
of
course,
it
was
within
the
servitude.
if
--
if
they
had
to
be
pushed
down
and
out
of
the
area
because
of
the
element
of
time,
that
would
have
been
within
the
servitude
and
we
maintain
that
having
--
then
pushing
them
down
in
this
manner
to
save
cost
is
within
the
servitude.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
i'll
express
an
opinion
on
that.
i
think
it
would
still
be
within
the
servitude.however,
it
is
not
impossible
to
imagine
that
if
time
were
not
a
factor
and
there
is
no
conceivable
way
--
reason
for
destroying
this
wealth
that
it
--
it
could
be
held
otherwise.
however,
i
find
this
--
the
force
of
the
servitude
and
the
scope
of
the
servitude
very
broad
when
it
relates
to
matters
that
are
land
or
--
or
things
attached
to
land
so
--
so
i
--
i
would
think
could
be
a
very
--
it
could
well
be
argued
that
it
could
have
been
taken
even
if
there
have
been
no
expressed
(inaudible)
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
there's
only
one
case
that
i
found
that
expressly
mentioned
trees.
there
are
many
that
mentioned
crops
and
lands
improvement.
the
dickson
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
specifically
refers
to
pecan
trees
and
they
were
held
to
be
within
the
servitude
and
there
was
no
argument
as
here
about
--
the
land
under
the
trees
was
necessary,
of
course,
as
is
always
the
case.
petitioner
challenges
the
procedure
by
which
the
levee
board
donated
this
property
to
the
united
states
maintaining
as
did
the
district
court
that
it
was
not
properly
donated
to
united
states.
that
requires
a
brief
background
of
statutory
provisions
and
--
and
resolutions.
i
think
i
can
summarize
them
rather
quickly.
the
federal
flood
control
act,
under
which
this
entire
project
is
being
conducted,
provides
that
no
money
shall
be
expended
until
the
states
or
levee
districts
have
given
assurances
satisfactory
to
the
secretary
of
the
army
that
they
will
provide
without
cost
to
the
united
states
or
rights-of-way
for
levee
foundations
and
levees
on
the
main
stem
of
the
mississippi
river.
the
19
--
that's
the
federal
flood
control
act.
the
1921
constitution
of
louisiana
authorizes
all
levee
districts
to
cooperate
with
the
federal
government
in
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
levees
in
the
state.
the
louisiana
legislature
enacted
a
law
in
1940
where
it
said
that
the
levee
boards
may
donate
or
convey
to
the
united
states
any
lands,
movable
or
immovable
property,
rights-of-way
or
servitude
which
they
may
own
or
acquire
for
use
by
the
united
states
in
connection
with
flood
control.
now,
by
--
now,
this
--
this
particular
levee
board,
the
fifth
louisiana
district
levee
board,
by
resolution
and
--
and
following
those
enactments
and
in
the
--
in
the
scheme
of
those
enactments
by
resolutions
in
1928
and
1929,
pledged
and
guaranteed,
using
those
two
terms,
itself
to
provide
without
cost
to
united
states
all
rights-of-way
for
levees
on
the
mississippi
river.
in
1945,
the
same
levee
board
passed
a
resolution
authorizing
its
president
and
now
i'm
quoting,
"to
grant
rights-of-way
where
the
need
is
immediate,
the
proper
right-of-way
resolution
to
be
passed
in
the
regular
manner
at
the
following
board
meeting."
now,
that
is
the
background
that
i
referred
to.
they
--
they
operate
on
these
facts.
the
army
district
engineer
wrote
to
levee
board
enclosing
the
plans
for
this
project,
which
plans
included
this
very
land
and
showed
it
on
the
--
by
a
diagram
as
a
borrow
pit
area
and
which
plans
had
been
approved
by
the
louisiana
state
department
of
public
works,
addressed
this
letter
to
the
president
of
this
levee
board
and
stated
--
asked
for
a
formal
statement
that
the
rights-of-way
are
available
and
granting
the
united
states
a
right-of-way
to
--
and
--
of
entry
to
prosecute
the
work.
now,
that
refers
back,
of
course,
to
the
assurances
of
the
levee
board
and
so
forth.it
also
said
this
statement
may
be
in
the
form
of
a
letter
signed
by
the
president
of
the
board.
and
that,
of
course,
relate
back
--
relates
back
to
the
resolution
of
the
board
that
the
president
may
do
so.
now,
the
president
replied
granting
the
right-of-way,
those
--
and
--
and
this
is
the
crucial
point,
those
letters
were
then
read
to
the
levee
board
at
its
next
regular
meeting,
both
letters,
the
request
and
the
reply
and
the
minutes
of
the
meeting
shall
--
that
the
levee
board
considered
the
request
complied
with.
now,
we
maintain
that
that
is
a
sufficient
supporting
basis
for
exercise
of
the
servitude
and
donation
of
it
to
united
states.
in
the
pruyn
case
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
the
president's
donation
was
june
12th,
1947
and
were
commenced
--
the
earliest
work
commenced
on
july
22nd.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
july
--
june
12th
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
--
was
the
date
that
the
president
took
that
action
and
a
little
over
a
month
later,
june
--
july
22nd,
the
--
the
first
work
began
on
one
of
the
two
tracts
of
land.in
--
in
august
on
the
next.
now
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
as
--
as
--
the
--
the
date
i
was
using,
your
honor,
appears
on
page
297
of
the
record
which
is
the
letter
from
the
president
of
the
levee
board
to
the
army
district
engineer
and
that's
dated
june
12th,
1947.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
yes.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
on
july
9th.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
yes,
that's
correct
and
work
was
actually
commenced
--
physically
commenced
on
july
22nd.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
there
was
an
element
of
--
of
emergency.
that
--
that
maybe
a
strong
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
--
word
but
it
--
there
--
it
could
--
it
had
to
be
done.
the
record
shows,
i'll
cite
the
pages
in
a
moment.
these
two
low
sections
of
the
--
of
the
levee
had
to
be
enlarged
during
the
coming
working
season
because
after
elimination
of
the
eudora
floodway
upstream,
it
was
necessary
to
go
back
down
below
--
downstream
and
--
and
raise
those
levees.
now,
that
had
to
be
done,
of
course,
before
the
next
flood
season.
so,
in
that
sense,
immediate
action
was
required
and
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
the
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
i
--
i
have
--
i
have
not
that
information.
i
--
i
can
only
--
i'll
only
say
this
that
these
are,
of
course,
large
levees
and
that
--
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
--
that
they
--
this
would
have
to
be
enlarged
because
they
had
eliminated
the
floodway
upstream
during
--
during
the
working
season.
the
length
of
that
season
i
don't
know.
certainly,
it
had
to
be
done
before
the
next
threat
of
--
of
seasonal
flood.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
it
could
be
the
outside
limit.
i'm
not
a
louisianan,
your
honor.
i
would
--
i
rather
gather
to
have
annual
floods,
of
course,
whether
they
have
more
than
that.
mr.
s.
billingsley
hill
well,
there
--
there
is
--
the
point
is
it's
very
important,
of
course.
in
that
sense,
there
--
there
was
that
immediacy
of
need
and
we
think,
for
example,
that
the
--
the
early
letting
of
the
contracts
probably
reflect
a
need
for
that
haste.
well,
in
summary,
i
just
say
this
one
thing
that
we
believe
plainly
that
the
timber
was
destroyed
in
this
case
not
by
a
direct
action
of
the
united
states
under
the
fifth
amendment
but
pursuant
to
a
valid
legal
transaction
between
it
and
the
levee
board.
and
therefore,
the
united
states
should
not
be
held
liable
for
the
destruction
of
this
timber.
