justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
see
if
i
can
get
to
(inaudible)
you
--
does
your
concession
extend
not
only
far
enough
to
say
that
the
state
can
appropriate
the
property
or
that
you
--
but
that
it
can
appropriate
it
for
that
payment
of
compensation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
that
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
that
property
that
they
do
not
have
to
pay
compensation
on?
i
--
i
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
understood
your
concession.
you
said
you
concede
to
have
a
right
to
appropriate.
do
you
concede
to
have
a
right
to
appropriate
without
paying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
question
is
in
--
do
we
have
that
question
here
whether
it's
to
be
used
for
levee
purposes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
--
i
hope
that
--
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear.
do
you
concede
the
state
has
a
right
to
take
this
property
for
this
purpose,
this
land,
for
this
purpose
without
paying
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
this
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
the
trees
to
see
if
i
could
get
your
claim.
then
is
it
your
claim
that
although
they
do
have
a
right
to
take
your
land
and
use
it
for
that
purpose
that
louisiana
law
requires
that
you
be
given
notice
before
they
destroy
your
trees
which
could
be
saved
and
the
land
still
being
utilized
for
the
purpose
intended.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
louisiana
take
the
land?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
took
it.
louisiana
did
not
appropriate
for
the
levee
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
had
given
you
notice
and
said
that
you've
got
time
to
get
your
trees
away
and
you
had
taken
them
away,
would
you
have
any
claim
either
against
the
government
or
the
state
of
louisiana?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
said
if
--
if
you
get
your
trees.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
said
if
you
gotten
your
trees
and
the
government
was
using
the
land
for
precisely
the
purpose
that's
here
as
under
the
circumstances
shown,
would
you
claim
that
you
had
--
would
you
assert
any
claim
against
the
government
or
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
your
claim
gets
down
to
the
--
one
that
the
state
can
take
it
for
levee
purposes,
the
land.
but
you
claim
that
they
shouldn't
have
destroyed
your
trees
that
you
could
have
had
time
to
save
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
government
itself
ought
to
pay
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
filed
any
claim
against
the
state
of
louisiana?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
view
the
question
raised
that
the
right
to
take
this
property
as
it
was
taken
is
one
decided
under
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
first
to
decide,
do
you
not,
whether
you
own
that
property
or
the
state
has
a
right
to
take
it
and
take
your
trees
along
with
it?
that
would
be
a
state
question,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
that
state
question
decided
against
you
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
state
cases
hold
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
deciding
against
this,
decided
the
very
case
which
are
similar.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
little
--
i
think
a
little
difficult
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(inaudible)
different
than
the
ones
they
did.
they
cite
them
as
showing
that
the
--
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
state
took
this
under
duty
of
procedure
and
if
--
i
noticed
in
the
--
it
was
a
valid
taking
under
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
they
answered
that
by
saying
that
they
gave
you
the
only
notice
that
the
law
provides
which
is
the
tax
assessment
record
and
they
gave
notice
to
the
tax
assessors
on
the
--
those
shown
to
the
owner
on
the
tax
assessment
role,
what
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
is
the
authority
for
the
last
statement
you
made
that
he
may
sue
the
levee
board
subsequently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
such
as
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
such
as
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
claim
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
their
judgment
in
connection
with
the
levee
board
here
as
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
held
that
the
judgment
then
for
the
levee
board
already?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
conclusion
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
filed
with
that
and
the
case
as
to
the
levee
board,
do
you
think
it
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
in
here.
if
the
levee
board
is
under
the
party,
has
the
levee
board
--
has
there
been
an
--
an
appeal
of
any
kind
of
a
judgment
relieving
the
levee
board
from
liability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
is
with
reference
to
the
levee
board's
liability
to
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
judgment
against
the
owner
of
this
land
in
favor
of
the
levee
board
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
what
you
reach
by
the
district
court
insofar
as
the
liability
of
the
levee
board
--
the
landowner
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
appealed
by
the
landowner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
be
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
there
was
reference
to
your
evaluation.
what
do
you
say
to
the
government
--
to
the
state's
brief
that
the
cases
they've
cited
to
the
effect
that
if
there
had
been
no
assessment
of
the
property
a
year
before,
it
could
get
no
value
at
all
under
louisiana
law?
do
you
agree
that
that's
the
law
of
louisiana
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
connection
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
they
have
three
cases
cited
that's
based
--
imperative
duty
and
that
it's
not
assessed,
no
value
can
be
paid.
they
can
recover
no
value.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
know
anything
about
their
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking
for
your
--
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
view.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
rely
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
it
applies.
