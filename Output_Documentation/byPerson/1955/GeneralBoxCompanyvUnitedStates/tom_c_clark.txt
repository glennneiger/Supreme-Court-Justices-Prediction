the
box

did
not
sue

did
they?
justice

c.

what
the
lower
court
must
have
held
was,
the
united
states
has
not
recovered
against
lawsuits
in
the
event
the
recovery
was
had
--
been
had,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
united
states
may
not
recover
against
the
levee
board?
justice

so,
what
i
was
wondering
about
was
whether
or
not
the
question
of
their
recovery
against
the
levee
board
within
their

at
all
so
they
never
sued
the
levee
board.
somewhere,

think
justice

asked
you
whether
or
not
that
question
will
still
be
here
when
we
get
to
see
the
fact
depending
on
whether
or
not
the
box
company
might
sue
the
levee
board.
well,
that
question
run
in
the
case
so
then
--
they
were
made
then
a
party,
didn't
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
your
recovery
was
--
your
--
the
making
of
the
levee
board
a
party
was
merely
to
recover
over
against
for
yourself.
