mr.
edward
donald
moseley
may
it
please
the
court.
this
suit
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
issue
before
the
court
primarily
and
basically
is
as
to
whether
or
not
the
government
is
liable
to
the
petitioner
under
the
tucker
act
for
the
value
of
certain
timber
which
was
destroyed
during
the
course
of
a
levee
enlargement
project
on
the
main
stem
of
the
mississippi
river
in
concordia
parish,
louisiana.
basically,
the
government
contends
that
the
property
was
subject
to
a
repair
in
servitude
that
this
servitude
was
correctly
exercised
by
the
levee
board
having
jurisdiction
over
this
area
and
that
the
government
derived
its
rights
through
the
levee
board
and
therefore
it
should
not
be
held
liable.
the
petitioner,
on
the
other
hand,
contends
that
there
was
never
any
valid
or
proper
appropriation
of
its
property
and
that
in
any
event
if
the
property
was
destroyed
not
pursuant
to
anything
which
the
levee
board
did
or
did
not
do
but
was
destroyed
as
a
direct
act
of
the
exercise
of
the
government's
own
sovereignty.
this
suit
was
initially
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
louisiana.
there
were
actually
two
suits
filed
which
were
consolidated,
both
arising
out
of
the
same
set
of
circumstances.
the
district
--
the
petitioner
claim
that
approximately
260
acres
of
timberland
lying
all
along
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
adjacent
to
the
river
and
between
the
river
and
levee
were
destroyed
by
government
contractors
in
carrying
out
an
enlargement
of
the
existing
levee.
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
i
might
point
out
that
timber
may
be
owned
separately
and
apart
from
the
land
upon
which
it
is
situated.
here,
the
petitioner
owned
a
timber
situated
on
--
in
this
area
and
the
fee
to
the
property
was
owned
by
a
separate
party,
however,
the
same
law
relating
to
immovables
is
applicable
as
to
timber
so
long
as
it
is
still
standing.
i
might
further
point
out
to
the
court
that
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
the
property
adjacent
to
a
navigable
stream
is
susceptible
of
private
ownership
down
to
its
--
the
low
average,
main
low
line
of
the
water
and
although
the
property
is
burdened
with
a
servitude,
the
property
may
be
bought
and
sold
the
same
as
any
other
property
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
subject
to
a
servitude
for
levee
purposes.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
i
was
going
to
get
into
that
later.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
under
the
specific
law
of
louisiana,
there
is
a
general
servitude
for
levee
purposes
which
extends
not
only
to
the
area
immediately
adjacent
to
the
levee
itself
but
to
whatever
area
may
be
reasonably
--
reasonably
necessary
in
order
for
the
proper
exercise
of
the
servitude
for
flood
control
purposes.
that
is
--
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
might
require
even
that
an
area
actually
beyond
the
levee
itself
be
burdened
with
the
servitude.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
it
is
far
back
as
the
reasonable
necessities
of
the
situation
would
require,
sir,
which
could
include
property
even
beyond
the
levee
on
the
landside.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
well,
it
--
probably
it
is
the
general
servitude
and
applies
reasonably
as
our
contention,
sir,
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
application
of
the
servitude.
the
--
the
district
court
--
first,
i
might
point
out
that
this
suit
was
originally
brought
both
under
the
provisions
of
the
tucker
act
and
alternatively
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
however,
the
petitioner
ultimately
abandoned
its
claim
as
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
as
--
we
are
claiming
relief
solely
upon
the
basis
of
the
tucker
act
at
the
present
time.
initially,
also,
the
contractors
who
performed
this
work
and
destroyed
this
timber
were
joined
as
party
as
defendant
to
the
suit
but
they
were
dismissed
from
the
action
on
the
motion
of
--
of
plaintiffs.
the
district
court
after
a
very
mature
deliberation
of
this
entire
matter,
the
case
was
tried,
of
course,
before
the
court
without
a
jury.
the
district
court,
judge
dawkins,
held
initially
that
the
levee
board
should
have
--
have
exercised
its
right
of
appropriation
by
following
the
expropriation
procedure,
which
is
an
eminent
domain
procedure,
specifically
set
forth
under
the
louisiana
statutes
and
that
in
the
absence
of
following
this
specific
procedure,
the
levee
board
did
not
affect
a
valid
appropriation
of
the
property
and
that
therefore
the
government
should
be
held
liable.
following
that
on
a
--
on
a
motion,
i
might
point
out
also
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
government
filed
a
third
party
complaint
against
the
levee
board
and
the
suit
was
tried
both
as
against
the
government
and
the
levee
board.
in
his
original
opinion,
judge
dawkins
held
that
both
--
that
the
levee
--
the
government
was
liable
to
the
petitioner
and
that
the
levee
board
was
liable
over
to
the
government
under
the
provisions
of
the
federal
flood
control
act
requiring
local
authorities
to
furnish
essential
right-of-ways
in
connection
with
levee
projects.
on
a
motion
for
--
on
a
new
trial,
however,
judge
dawkins
held,
first
of
all,
that
the
government
had
not
required
out
of
the
levee
board
a
valid
appropriation
of
this
property
and
that
in
the
absence
of
a
valid
appropriation
of
the
property
by
the
levee
board
in
the
absence
of
the
government
requiring
that
to
taking
--
was
a
taking
directly
by
the
government
itself
for
which
the
government
which
should
be
held
liable
under
the
provisions
of
the
fifth
amendment.
on
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
judgment
of
judge
dawkins
was
reversed
with
judge
cameron
discerning.
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
this
property
had
been
validly
appropriated
by
the
levee
board
under
louisiana
law
and
that
since
it
had
been
validly
appropriated
for
levee
purposes,
the
--
there
was
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
as
much
as
the
levee
board
had
properly
appropriated
the
property
and
conveyed
right-of-ways
to
the
government.
the
fifth
circuit
also
held
that
in
any
event
under
the
provisions
of
section
6
of
article
xvi
of
the
louisiana
constitution,
compensation
was
not
allowed
for
a
property
used
or
destroyed
for
levee
purposes
where
that
property
is
situated
on
batture
or
in
any
event,
it
is
not
allowed
where
the
property
has
not
been
assessed
and
the
--
and
the
recovery
is
limited
under
that
provision
of
the
article
of
the
constitution
which
we
will
hereafter
show
as
inapplicable
to
this
case.but
the
fifth
circuit
applied
that
article
of
the
constitution
in
denying
recovery
to
the
petitioner.
we
contend
first
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
property
was
situated
on
batture
and
which
is
property
between
the
ordinary
low-water
mark
and
the
average
high-water
mark.
and
that
under
the
louisiana
constitutional
provision,
no
compensation
was
allowed
for
a
batture
of
property
used
or
destroyed
for
levee
purposes.
as
--
now
here,
i
have
to
point
out,
we
don't
believe
that
that
article
has
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
present
case.our
position
is
primarily
that
--
as
i
previously
stated
that
there
was
no
valid
appropriation
of
this
property
by
the
levee
board.and
that
in
any
event,
the
government
itself,
directly
through
its
own
agencies,
appropriated
this
property.
in
order
to
ascertain
just
--
in
--
and
in
as
much
as
the
government
relies
upon
certain
actions
which
were
taken
by
the
levee
board
in
this
case,
i
think
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
briefly
review
just
exactly
what
occurred
with
reference
to
this
particular
project.
in
1928
and
1929,
the
levee
board
passed
two
general
resolutions
having
relationship
to
no
particular
property
in
which
they
agreed
to
provide
right-of-ways
without
cost
to
the
federal
government
in
connection
with
flood
control
projects
and
otherwise
cooperate
with
the
government
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
flood
control
act.
this
resolution
did
not
describe
any
specific
properties
and
did
not
in
and
of
itself
attempt
to
appropriate
any
particular
properties.
in
may
of
1947,
the
louisiana
state
department
of
public
works
wrote
to
the
levee
board
that
they
had
received
plans
from
the
united
states
engineers
concerning
an
enlargement
of
an
existing
levee
in
that
area
and
they
recommended
to
the
government
--
to
the
levee
board
that
they
cooperate
with
the
government
in
the
execution
of
this
project.
thereafter,
on
june
the
10th,
1947,
the
united
states
engineers
forwarded
plans
to
the
levee
board
and
requested
a
statement
that
right-of-ways
were
--
were
available.
it
was
said
in
the
government's
letter
that
this
statement
could
be
in
the
form
of
a
letter
directed
to
united
states
engineers.
thereafter,
the
president
of
the
levee
board
wrote
to
the
united
states
engineers
and
advised
him
that
he
was
happy
to
comply
with
their
request.
the
president
of
the
levee
board
was
purportedly
acting
under
a
resolution
which
had
been
adopted
by
the
levee
board
some
two
years
previous
to
this
time
in
1945
which
authorized
in
--
in
emergency
situations,
the
president
of
the
levee
board
to
grant
right-of-ways
to
the
government
upon
a
letter
without
a
prior
meeting
of
the
board,
but
the
resolution
provided
that
the
proper
right-of-way
resolution
shall
thereafter
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
board
be
adopted.
so,
the
president
merely
wrote
this
letter
to
the
united
states
engineers
advising
that
the
right-of-ways
were
available.
in
the
--
at
the
next
board
meeting
on
july
the
9th,
1947,
the
board
met
but
there
was
no
action
taken
with
reference
to
the
letter
which
the
president
of
the
--
of
the
levee
board
had
written
other
than
a
mention
of
the
fact
was
made
in
the
minutes
that
this
letter
had
been
written
by
the
president
of
the
levee
board
to
the
united
states
engineers,
neither
his
in
that
letter
nor
any
of
the
resolutions
or
anything
else
described
any
specific
property.
it
did
not
describe
the
property
of
the
petitioner
herein.
it
did
not
provide
any
means
of
giving
any
type
of
notice
to
the
property
owners
involved.
thereafter
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
--
i
believe,
sir,
it
just
merely
said
that
the
right-of-ways
are
available,
"we
are
happy
to
comply
with
your
request
and
the
right-of-ways
are
available."
i
--
as
i
recall
it,
there
was
no
specific
mention
of
any
particular
area
at
all.
in
any
event
thereafter,
the
--
the
engineers
in
july,
this
--
the
first
communication
from
the
department
of
public
works
in
the
state
of
louisiana
was
in
may
and
then
in
july,
the
united
states
engineer
has
wrote
to
the
board
that
instructions
to
begin
this
work
had
been
issued
on
july
the
10th.
and
on
july
the
22nd,
1947,
work
was
begun
on
one
of
the
plaintiff's
tracks
and
the
work
commenced
on
the
other
plaintiff's
tracks
on
august
the
11th.
on
june
the
20th,
1947
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
sir?
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
there,
i'm
--
i'm
coming
to
that
in
just
a
few
minutes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
coming
to
what
the
levee
board
attempted
to
do
insofar
as
notice
is
concerned
right
now.
in
june
of
1947,
on
june
the
20th,
the
board
requested
from
the
assessor
of
concordia
parish
a
list
of
property
owners.
apparently,
the
assessor
did
not
comply
with
their
request.
and
on
july
the
18th,
1947,
another
request
was
made.
again,
that
he
furnish
a
list
of
property
owners.
on
the
july
the
31st,
1947,
a
list
of
property
owners
was
furnished
to
the
levee
board.
the
plaintiff's
--
the
petitioner's
name
was
not
upon
this
list
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
property
was
not
assessed,
although
their
property
was
a
matter
of
public
record
in
the
conveyance
records,
their
property
was
not
listed
upon
the
assessment
rolls.
however,
it
would
have
been
a
relatively
easy
matter
to
have
checked
the
conveyance
records
himself
and
ascertained
whether
or
not
plaintiff
--
or
who
had
any
interest
in
this
batture
and
in
this
timber.
in
any
event,
notices
--
written
notices
were
not
sent
out
by
the
levee
board
until
october
the
10th,
1947
which
was,
as
i
previously
pointed
out,
several
months
after
the
work
had
already
commenced
on
the
plaintiff's
property.
the
first
notice
to
plaintiff
had
--
that
anything
was
going
to
happen
to
his
property
was
when
he
was
suddenly
confronted
with
bulldozers
in
that
area
knocking
over
his
timber,
pushing
it
out
of
the
way.
the
--
it
was
--
the
government
conceded
that
the
only
purpose
--
that
the
purpose
for
this
--
clearing
this
area
was
to
obtain
an
area
from
which
dirt
could
be
obtained,
a
borrow
pits,
so
as
to
increase
--
enlarge
the
levee
itself.
the
government
further
conceded
during
the
trial
of
the
case
that
the
only
read
--
that
the
government
plans
and
specifications
themselves
specifically
provided
for
the
destruction
of
this
timber
and
that
the
reason
for
it
was
because
it
would
affect
a
savings
in
cost.
in
other
words,
the
government,
prior
to
the
time
any
action
was
taken
by
the
levee
board,
prior
to
the
time
the
levee
board
had
been
communicated
with,
had
made
its
own
independent
conclusion
that
this
timber
should
be
--
should
be
destroyed
and
it
included
it
specifically
in
the
plans
and
specifications
in
regard
to
this
job,
the
contract
was
let
upon
the
basis
of
destroying
the
timber.
petitioner,
upon
learning
of
this
destruction
which
was
occurring
on
his
place,
it
had
been
practically
completed
in
one
area
by
the
time
he
learned
of
it
and
was
in
progress
in
another
area,
went
out
and
asked
the
contractor
to
allow
him
to
log
those
trees
out
of
that
area.
the
contractor
refused,
stating
that
his
contract
and
his
bid
had
been
made
upon
the
basis
of
bulldozing
this
timber
and
that
he
would
not
permit
the
--
the
owner
of
the
timber
to
log
it
out
of
the
area.
the
--
the
owner
of
the
timber
thereafter,
in
order
to
minimize
his
damages
at
least,
did
make
some
arrangements
to
partially
salvage
some
of
the
property
but
the
property
--
the
--
the
timber,
but
the
timber
was
not
fit
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
originally
being
grown
due
to
the
fact
that
the
tremendous
impact
of
the
bulldozers
knocking
these
trees
over
destroyed
the
fiber
and
i
believe
that
they
ended
up
using
them
for
making
boxes,
the
one's
that
they
could
salvage,
rather
than
for
veneer
which
that
was
and
originally
anticipating.
now,
i
think
that
the
foregoing
facts
clearly
and
specifically
show
that
the
government
in
this
case
did
not
require
an
effective
appropriation
of
this
property
by
the
levee
board.
now,
we've
recognize
the
fact
that
the
property
alone,
in
navigable
stream,
in
louisiana
is
burdened
with
a
servitude
in
favor
of
the
property.
and
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
expropriation
and
appropriation
and
that
although
no
formal
procedure
is
required
in
order
to
affect
an
appropriation
of
property,
they
nevertheless,
as
judge
dawkins
put
it,
it
does
require
action
appropriate
to
the
circumstances.
that
is
such
action
as
will
minimize
the
loss
to
the
landowner.
here,
there
was
actually
no
notice
whatsoever.
the
government
has
told
the
levee
board,
"you
can
furnish
to
seize
right-of-ways
by
writing
us
a
letter.
you
won't
be
required
to
furnish
a
formal
resolution."
they
required
--
did
not
require
the
board
to
give
him
any
notice
whatsoever.
and
we
take
the
position
here
and
we
think
it's
a
sound
one
that
an
appropriation
of
private
property
cannot
be
affected
by
a
series
of
private
letters
between
the
various
governmental
agencies
involved
without
any
notice
whatsoever
to
the
property
owner.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
the
appropriation
itself
is
the
physical
taking
of
the
property.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
now,
i
--
i'm
a
drawing
a
distinction,
sir,
between
the
formalities
of
an
expropriation
procedure
or
an
eminent
domain
proceeding
in
a
proceeding
under
which
the
--
the
government
goes
in
and
appropriates
the
property
without
going
through
the
formalities
prescribed
in
a
formal
--
formal
eminent
domain
proceeding.
the
louisiana
courts
have
recognized
that
there
is
no
formal
procedure
which
must
be
followed
in
order
to
affect
an
appropriation
as
distinguished
from
an
expropriation
or
eminent
domain
proceeding.
however,
and
i
--
i'm
sure
the
government
will
concede
this,
that
although
the
louisiana
courts
have
not
outlined
any
specific
procedure
or
set
any
minimum
standards
which
must
be
obtained
in
order
to
affect
appropriation,
the
courts
--
the
louisiana
courts
on
innumerable
occasions
specifically
stating
that
the
power
to
appropriate
private
property
for
a
public
use
is
one
which
--
which
cannot
be
capriciously
exercised.
it
must
be
exercised
reasonably,
not
arbitrarily.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
no,
sir.
we
--
the
owner
of
batture,
sir,
has
--
owns
the
property
down
to
the
ordinary
low-water
mark.
under
the
law
of
louisiana
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
it
is
subject
to
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
a
servitude.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
think
it
does,
sir,
that
they
--
since
--
in
as
much
as
the
property
owner
owns
this
batture
or
owns
a
property
adjacent
to
the
river
that
when
the
government
gets
ready
to
exercise
its
rights
under
the
servitude,
it
has
to
take
reasonable
action
to
afford
protection
to
the
property
owners
involved
so
as
to
afford
them
an
opportunity
to
minimize
their
losses.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
i
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
it's
--
it's
subject
to
the
--
it's
subject
to
the
test
of
reasonableness
--
reasonableness,
sir.
that
is
it
must
be
reasonably
exercised
and
not
capriciously
exercised
and
in
a
manner
in
which
you're
willing
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
would
cause
any
undue
hardship
to
the
individual
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
property
owners
involved.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
have
to
concede,
sir,
that
there
is
under
the
law
of
louisiana,
a
right
of
appropriation.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
unless
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
the
argument
can
be
made,
sir,
that
the
provisions
of
the
federal
flood
control
act
have
suspended
state
law
in
that
respect
and
that
--
that
the
--
the
federal
government
when
it
proceeds
to
direct
to
take
property
is
controlled
by
the
fifth
amendment
itself.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
that
is
correct,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
claiming
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
primarily
and
basically
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
that
is
absolutely
correct.
as
judge
cameron
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
it
could
have
been
any
various
types
of
wealth
situated
on
this
batture.
if
i
may
draw
an
example,
sir,
in
my
own
hometown
of
baton
rouge,
louisiana,
there
has
recently
been
created
a
port
authority
which
has
issued
bonds
in
the
amount
of
$12
million
for
the
purpose
of
building
various
types
of
port
facilities
including
wharfs,
grain
terminals,
railroad
facilities
and
various
things
of
that
nature.
some
of
that
property
is
situated
between
the
river
and
the
levee
and
some
is
situated
on
the
outside
of
the
levee.
however,
if
we
accept
the
government's
position
as
being
true
in
this
case,
that
right
of
appropriation
could
be
exercised
to
such
an
extent
that
those
entire
facilities
could
be
immediately
destroyed
without
any
compensation
whatsoever.
and
we
take
the
position
that
--
and
--
that
there
is
this
right
of
appropriation
but
that
it
must,
nevertheless,
be
reasonably
exercised
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
inconvenience,
the
property
owner
is
involved
as
little
as
possible.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
not
in
our
cases,
sir.
i
can
--
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
the
danger
of
flooding
was
so
imminent
that
there
might
not
be
a
possibility
of
giving
notice
before
that
appropriation
could
be
effected.
here,
however,
in
this
particular
case,
there
would
have
been
ample
time
to
afford
these
property
owners
an
opportunity
to
confer
with
the
u.s.--
u.s.
engineers
and
with
the
levee
board
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
work
something
out
just
so
that
they
could
at
least
minimize
their
damages
without
going
in
and
just
arbitrarily
destroying
their
property
without
any
previous
notification
whatsoever.
i
can
--
as
i
say,
however,
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
where
an
imminent
danger
of
flood
might
not
permit
that
to
be
done
and
i
come
back
to
--
i
think
judge
dawkins
in
his
opinion
phrased
it
very
well
when
he
said
that
action
appropriate
to
the
circumstances
must
be
taken.
and
--
and
that
is,
of
course,
a
very
general
concept
but
i
think
it
is
one
which
in
--
in
each
specific
case,
if
it
is
properly
applied,
would
afford
a
degree
of
protection
to
the
property
owners
in
the
exercise
of
their
own
right
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
no,
sir,
the
--
the
louisiana
--
louisiana
has
never
specifically
set
forth
any
particular
procedure
under
which
this
right
of
appropriation
must
be
exercised.
however,
and
as
pointed
out
in
numerous
cases
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
very
course
--
cases
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
in
deciding
this
case
against
us
actually
support
our
position
that
the
servitude
must
be
reasonably
exercised.
there
were
three
cases
basically
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
predicated
its
decision.
there
were
cases
of
danziger
versus
united
states,
dickson
versus
board
and
board
of
commissioners
versus
trouille,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief.
in
the
danziger
case,
which
was
--
which
was
decided
by
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
the
record
there
--
the
case
there
shows
that
actually
what
the
levee
board
did
--
and
i
think
that
you
will
find
this
as
probably
the
customary
procedure
which
is
followed
in
--
in
practically
all
cases.
through
a
reading
of
the
cases,
you'll
see
that
the
customary
procedure
is
this
as
what
the
levee
board
did
in
this
case.
in
the
danziger
case,
the
orleans
parish
levee
board,
before
the
appropriation
was
effective,
passed
a
formal
resolution
specifically
describing
the
properties
involved.
they
--
they
thereafter
sent
out
a
notice
by
registered
mail
to
all
of
the
property
owners
involved.
after
that
was
done,
the
levee
board
itself
set
about
physically
removing
the
improvements
that
were
within
the
area
to
be
appropriated.
now
certainly,
in
a
--
that
does
provide
an
effective
means
for
protecting
the
property
owner.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
under
the
louisiana
statute
--
that
is
another
point
which
we
have
in
the
case,
sir.
prior
to
1921,
there
was
no
provision
in
the
louisiana
constitution
providing
for
payment
for
a
property
used
or
destroyed
for
levee
purposes
at
all.
that
is
if
a
property
were
used
or
destroyed
for
levee
purposes,
no
compensation
at
all
was
due
under
the
law
of
louisiana.of
course,
i'm
not
speaking
of
the
federal
law
at
the
present
time
but
maybe
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
controlling
here
and
we
contend
that
it
is.
but
under
the
louisiana
law,
there
was
no
provision
for
compensation.
in
1921,
article
vi
of
section
16
of
the
louisiana
constitution
was
adopted
which
provided
that
as
to
property
used
or
destroyed
for
levee
purposes,
compensation
would
be
due
at
the
assessed
value
of
the
property.
provided,
however,
that
no
compensation
would
be
due
at
all
for
property
situated
on
batture
or
property
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
owned
by
an
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
sir?
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir,
under
certain
circumstances.
however,
that
right
must
be
reasonably
exercised
and
the
property
which
is
appropriated
must
be
used
for
levee
purposes.
here,
the
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
that
is
a
portion
of
the
case.
yes,
sir.
our
position
on
that
is
this,
if
these
trees
clearly
were
not
used
for
levee
purposes.
the
--
the
trees
form
no
part
of
the
levee
itself
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
concede
that
they
have
a
right
of
appropriation
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
for
this
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
not
for
the
--
well,
i
--
i
don't
concede
that
they
had
the
right
to
destroy
these
trees,
sir
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
the
law
does
not
--
the
louisiana
law
does
not
contain
any
specific
requirement
as
to
notice.
there
is
no
formal
procedure
set
forth.
the
--
however,
and
i
will
reiterate
this
again,
the
--
the
general
practice
is
to
take
reasonable
steps
to
afford
the
maximum
degree
of
protection
to
the
property
owner
to
take
steps
appropriate
to
the
circumstances.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
no,
sir.
the
government
took
it.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
they
purportedly
granted
these
right-of-ways
to
the
government,
sir.
the
--
the
levee
project
was
actually
constructed
by
government
engineers
under
--
under
a
government
contract.
under
the
flood
control
act,
the
local
authorities
are
supposed
to
furnish
right-of-ways
for
levees
or
levee
foundations
free
of
cost
to
the
government.
that
is
what
the
levee
board
did
in
this
case.
they
--
they
wrote
a
letter
to
the
levee
--
to
the
united
states
engineers
advising
them
that
the
right-of-ways
were
available
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
and
that
is
the
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
think
i
would,
sir.
i
--
i
have
a
claim
against
the
government
for
this
reason,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
claim
for
just
compensation,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
for
the
trees,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
oh,
no,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
don't
believe
so,
sir.
the
property
would
have
been
devoted
specifically
for
levee
purposes.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
it
would
have
been
a
reasonable
use
and
perhaps
a
reasonable
method
of
exercising
the
right
of
appropriation.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
no,
sir.
the
state
of
louisiana
was
joined
as
a
third
party
defendant
by
the
government.
now,
may
i
--
in
that
connection,
i
might
state
that
regardless
of
what
the
levee
board
did
or
did
not
do
in
this
case
that
even
prior
to
the
time
there
was
any
communication
between
the
government
and
the
levee
board,
the
government
had
itself
prepared
these
plans
and
specifications
specifically
authorizing
destruction
of
the
timber
and
it's
conceded
by
the
government
that
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
government
would
save
money
on
its
contracts.
the
government
argues
that
it's
a
relevant
factor
to
take
into
account
that
the
cost
of
a
public
project
is
a
relevant
factor
to
take
into
consideration.
they
had
the
right
to
take
into
consideration
cost
and
allow
practically
confiscation
of
this
property
on
the
basis
that
it
would
save
the
government
money.
we
concede,
of
course,
that
cost
is
a
relevant
factor
in
any
public
project
but
it
is
not
so
relevant
that
you
can
abrogate
completely
the
principles
of
due
process
in
just
compensation.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
think
basically,
sir,
the
case
involves
perhaps
an
application
of
both.
my
--
my
--
the
general
question
does
insofar
as
a
particular
problem
involved
here
is
concerned,
i
think
it
requires
only
an
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
the
government
itself
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
would
be
determined
by
a
state
procedure,
i
believe.
but
--
but
i
still
come
back
to
my
original
proposition.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
property
had
been
properly
appropriated
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
under
state
law.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir,
including
the
trees.
they
--
they
now
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
no,
sir.
i
--
i
can't
concede
that
for
this
reason
that
even
prior
to
the
appropriation
or
the
attempted
appropriation
by
the
state
authorities,
the
government
itself
had
in
effect
taken
this
timber
by
specifying
in
its
plans
and
specifications
that
the
timber
would
be
destroyed.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
and
that
the
taking
then
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
the
--
after
the
contracts
were
let.
in
the
contract,
he
had
a
perfect
right
and
he
insisted
upon
his
right
to
go
in
there
and
destroy
those
trees,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
that
is
one
of
the
basis
of
our
claim,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
the
court
of
appeals
did,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir.
that
--
that,
of
course,
may
have
involved
a
question
of
fact
which
was
decided
in
our
favor
by
the
district
court.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
should
think,
sir,
that
it
is
a
question
of
fact
for
this
reason.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
in
the
district
court.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
they
reviewed
the
records,
sir.
the
--
the
same
actions
which
i
have
reviewed
here
as
to
the
action
taken
by
the
levee
board
and
they
concluded
that
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
there
have
been
a
valid
appropriation.
now,
the
louisiana
courts
have
held
that
--
that
a
property
owner
owning
property
of
this
type
is
not
without
a
remedy
and
that
the
authority
of
this
board
is
subject
to
judicial
control
wherever
oppression
and
injustice
is
shown.
judge
dawkins
was
of
the
clear
opinion
and
he
so
stated
that
there
was
oppression
and
injustice
in
this
case
after
reviewing
all
of
the
facts.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
in
the
--
yes,
sir.
and
i'm
--
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
sir.
i
would
like
to
go
into
that
at
this
point
just
a
little
bit.
judge
dawkins
is
one
of
the
more
distinguished
jurors
in
louisiana.
he
was
formerly
a
supreme
court
judge
prior
to
--
going
on
the
federal
bench.
he
was
a
member
of
the
1921
louisiana
constitutional
convention
at
which
the
constitutional
provisions
were
adopted,
which
are
being
--
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
he
had
a
very
long
and
distinguished
career
as
a
district
judge
and
we
--
we
in
louisiana
consider
him
as
not
only
one
of
the
outstanding
judges
in
our
state
but
in
the
nation.
in
addition
to
that,
judge
dawkins
was
the
author
of
two
of
the
landmark
decisions
involving
this
same
type
of
controversy,
the
case
of
tilden
versus
united
states
and
the
case
of
wolfe
versus
hurley.
and
we
think
that
in
view
of
all
of
those
circumstances
that
judge
dawkins'
opinion
was
certainly
entitled
to
great
weight.
if
there
was
a
man
who
was
imminently
qualified
to
pass
upon
the
questions
involving
this
case,
it
was
certainly
judge
dawkins.
now,
going
back
again
briefly
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
it
cited
three
cases,
one
in
which
i
have
discussed,
the
danziger
case
in
which
specific
notice
was
given.
the
court
of
appeals
also
cited
the
dickson
case,
a
louisiana
supreme
court
case
in
which
--
although
it
didn't
involve
this
particular
point,
the
courts
held
that
the
actions
of
these
boards
are
subject
to
review
when
there
has
been
impalpable
abuse
of
their
powers.
in
the
third
case
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
found
that
there
had
been
a
substantial
compliance
with
an
act
requiring
notice
as
to
the
particular
levee
board
involved
in
that
case.
but
we
take
the
position
that
the
cases
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals
actually
support
our
view
in
this
case.
and
that
with
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
it
probably
show
that
as
a
matter
of
administrative
practice,
it
has
been
the
practice
of
levee
boards
throughout
the
state
to
forward
where
possible
reasonable
notice
and
an
adequate
opportunity
to
the
landowner
to
remove
his
property
prior
to
undertaking
these
various
projects.
i
might
point
out
specifically
the
case
of
board
versus
kelly
which
is
cited
in
my
brief.
in
that
case,
there
are
group
of
people
who
live
on
the
batture
around
--
in
orleans
parish
in
louisiana.
these
people
have
no
title
to
the
property
whatsoever.
they're
just
merely
squatters.
they
--
they
build
a
little
house
along
the
batture
and
they
then
don't
have
to
buy
a
lot.
they
--
they
have
their
lot
free
of
cost
so
they
did
up
until
this
point.
these
people
nevertheless,
a
great
number
of
them
were
occupying
this
batture
area.
they're
called
batture
dwellers.
the
orleans
parish
levee
board
proceeded
to
make
a
necessary
arrangement
to
cooperate
with
the
federal
government
in
a
levee
improvement
project
to
notify
these
batture
owners
to
get
off.
they
wouldn't
get
off
and
the
state
--
the
levee
board,
rather
than
arbitrarily
going
on
this
property
and
just
destroying
it,
have
filed
and
did
file
a
suit
for
a
mandatory
injunction
requiring
these
people
to
remove
their
property
before
going
ahead
with
the
project.
and
we
think
that
on
the
basis
of
all
of
that,
on
the
basis
of
the
louisiana
decisions
involving
the
right
of
appropriation,
that
there
was
clearly
not
a
valid
appropriation
made
by
the
levee
board
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
at
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
at
the
expense
of
the
owner,
sir,
but
i
believe
that
--
especially
that
particular
statute
anticipates
a
formal
proceeding
to
require
removal
and
does
anticipate
that
the
owner
can
remove
them
at
his
expense.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
we
would
have
been
very
happy
to
have
removed
this
property
at
our
expense,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
that
statute,
sir,
i
think
it's
--
it's
permissive
and
that
it
says
that
they
may
be
removed.
there's
an
area
of
discretion
involved
there,
i
think,
sir.
furthermore,
this
particular
statute,
as
i
recall
the
state
throughout
the
cases
arising
under
that
statute
and
do
anticipate
a
contradictory
proceeding
before
they
remove
unless
required.
and
furthermore,
it
says
--
i
believe
that
statute
says
works
which
have
formally
been
built
on
public
places
or
in
the
beds
of
rivers
may
be
destroyed.
here,
the
property
was
just
a
natural
growth
and
of
course
it
was
timber
which
was
involved
not
a
structure.
so,
for
all
of
those
various
reasons,
i
don't
believe
that
that
particular
statute
has
any
application
at
all
to
this
case,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
we
--
we
think
that
we
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
remove
that
timber,
so
we
recognize
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
that
there
is
a
servitude
existing.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
no,
only
insofar
as
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
the
destruction
of
our
timbers
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
is
concerned.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
the
statute
itself
does
not
require
any
formal
proceeding,
sir,
but
it
requires
reasonable
action
upon
the
part
of
the
governmental
agencies
involved.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
it's
--
it's
been
--
i
think
that
the
general
law
in
louisiana,
and
i'm
sure
it
is
elsewhere,
sir,
is
that
whenever
a
servitude
exists
that
it
must
be
exercised
in
a
reasonable
manner
and
in
a
way
which
would
be
least
burdensome
and
inconvenient
to
the
property
burdened
with
the
servitude.
and
i
think
that
is
--
that
principle
is
particularly
applicable
here.our
louisiana
courts
have
said
that
--
that
the
levee
board's
discretion
is
not
unbridled,
that
it
must
--
that
when
oppression
and
injustice
is
shown
that
--
that
the
landowner
has
a
remedy
in
the
courts.
and
we
certainly
think
that
the
landowner,
the
owner
of
this
timber
here,
should
have
been
given
an
opportunity
to
salvage
his
property.
now,
that
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
--
my
previous
argument
has
been
based
upon
the
fact,
of
course,
that
--
that
the
government
did
or
could
obtain
certain
rights
through
the
levee
board,
but
here,
actually,
the
government
was
not
relying
upon
any
rights
whatsoever
that
it
derived
through
or
from
the
levee
board.
the
government
made
its
own
contract
and
let
the
contract
on
the
basis
of
bulldozing
this
standing
timber.
the
property
of
this
--
this
timber
was
not
used
or
destroyed
for
timber
purposes
but
solely
to
save
money
on
the
part
of
the
government.
that's
conceded.
the
destruction,
we
don't
believe
was
and
i
think
the
record
would
bear
us
out,
was
not
essential
to
the
exercise
of
the
riparian
servitude.
it
was
not
exercised
reasonably
and
although
cost
may
be
a
relevant
factor,
we
don't
believe
that
it
can
be
used
to
circumvent
the
effect
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
point
out
this,
that
if
the
government
position
is
correct
here,
why
then
the
government
can
do
by
any
direction
what
it
could
not
do
directly.
it
can
in
effect
by
utilizing.
the
procedure
followed
here
circumvent
the
effect
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
because
it
was
--
it
was
a
taking
by
the
government
under
a
contract
let
by
the
government
in
order
to
save
money
for
the
government.
and
we
think
that
since
the
property
was
appropriated
for
a
public
use
in
--
to
that
extent,
a
compensation
should
be
allowed
to
these
owners
of
this
timber.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
it
was
--
it's
the
position
we
take
that
if
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
assume,
sir,
that
the
plans
and
specifications
did
show
specifically
the
area
involved.
the
government
did
forward
plans
and
specifications
to
them
and
they
should
--
they
were,
i'm
sure
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
--
familiar
with
the
plans
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
it
was
referred
to
as
brabston
and
--
and
--
i
forgot
the
name
of
it,
sir,
but
the
two
enlargements
involved.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
brabston
and
ashland,
i
believe.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
yes,
sir.
now,
we
--
we
further
believe
that
the
right
of
appropriation
such
as
exists
here
where
you
do
have
the
right
to
--
under
certain
circumstances
take
the
property
of
another
without
the
formality
of
an
expropriation
or
a
condemnation
proceeding
that
it
is
certainly
a
right
which
should
be
strictly
construed
and
cautiously
exercised.
and
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
that
is
correct,
sir,
primarily.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
in
the
cases.
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
it
is,
of
course,
a
concept
of
reasonableness
which
i
don't
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
the
most
analogous
case
that
i
can
think
of,
sir,
is
the
case
of
tilden
versus
the
united
states
which
is
a
case
which
was
relied
upon
by
judge
dawkins.
there
are
certain
distinguishing
features
in
that
case.
however,
in
that
case,
certain
timber
was
destroyed
in
connection
with
a
levee
project
and
judge
dawkins
concluded
in
that
case
that
there
had
been
an
appropriation
by
the
government
and
held
the
government
liable
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
don't
believe
that
i
specifically
cited
that
case
in
my
brief,
sir.
it
is
in
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
the
state
cases
--
i
have
just
--
insofar
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain,
sir,
i
have
just
set
forth
a
concept
of
reasonableness
without
specifying
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
this
situation
has
developed
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
nobody
has
ever
challenged
to
any
great
extent
just
exactly
the
procedure
which
was
followed
by
these
levee
boards.but
--
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
courts
had
not
ever
prescribed
any
specific
procedure
in
louisiana,
they
have
stated
that
--
that
the
actions
cannot
be
arbitrary,
cannot
be
capriciously
exercised
and
that
the
property
owner
has
a
judicial
remedy
when
oppression
and
injustice
is
shown.
that
is
the
only
test
which
has
been
set
forth
by
the
courts
of
louisiana
insofar
as
i
know.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
there
are
various
cases
cited
in
my
brief
in
which
the
court
--
courts
have
on
--
in
a
number
of
cases,
of
course,
found
that
this
right
of
appropriation
does
exist.
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
cited
in
my
brief
in
which
we
--
we
recognize
that
principle,
that
--
that
there
is
a
right
of
appropriation
under
louisiana
law
and
that
--
if
that
right
is
legally
and
properly
exercised
for
a
lawful
purpose
that
there
is
no
compensation
due,
but
it
--
it
is
still
subject
to
reasonableness
under
louisiana
law.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
it
is
probably
mostly
dictum
in
a
louisiana
case.
the
case
of
dickson
versus
the
board
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
actions
of
the
board
are
subject
to
review,
where
there
has
been
a
powerful
abuse
of
their
power,
the
case
of
board
of
commissioners
versus
trouille.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
don't
believe
the
case
involved
specifically
the
requirements
as
to
notice,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
i
don't
believe
--
the
only
--
the
only
place
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
any
cases
involving
the
procedure
is
where
--
for
instance
in
the
danziger
case,
where
they
did
show
what
the
procedure
was
that
the
board
followed.
and
that
--
that
is
the
only
case
in
which
--
which
i
recall,
in
which
there
was
outlined
a
procedure
which
the
board
did
follow,
but
the
court
has
never
specifically
stated,
so
far
as
i
know,
exactly
what
that
procedure
would
be.
i
think
that
perhaps
it
might
be
a
question
of
first
impression
which
in
the
absence
of
any
affirmative
finding
in
the
state
court,
perhaps,
this
court
would
be
called
upon
to
decide
independently.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
to
the
contrary
to
what?
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
think
the
principles
of
law
are
pretty
well
agreed
upon
in
this
case,
your
honor.
that
is
we
agree
that
there
is
a
right
of
appropriation
but
we
contend
and
the
case
has
bear
us
out
that
is
--
it
is
a
right
which
must
be
reasonably
exercised.
we
make
a
further
contention
of
course,
adhere
of
course,
the
taking
was
actually
by
the
government,
independently
of
anything
that
the
board
did.
and
that
therefore
the
fifth
amendment
should
control.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
i
need
to
tell
you
that
the
louisiana
law
requires
notice
because
it
is
never
been
specifically
set
out
that
it
does
require
notice.
i
think
judge
dawkins,
who
gave
this
case
a
very
mature
deliberation,
came
up
with
the
right
answer
when
he
said
that
levee
boards
must
take
action
appropriate
to
the
circumstances.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
--
i
know
of
any
declaration
which
can
sum
it
up
any
better
than
that,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
so
far
as
i
know,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
now,
there
is
one
louisiana
case,
the
pruyn
case
versus
nelson
which
involved
the
question
of
taking
the
dirt
from
the
batture
and
using
it
on
the
levee
enlargement
project.
it
didn't
involve
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
taking
timber
in
the
method
this
was
taken.
i
believe
the
court
in
that
case
--
although
no
specific
contention
was
made
as
to
the
method
utilized
or
the
procedure
utilized,
the
court
did
make
a
statement
in
that
case
that
the
customary
way
to
appropriate
the
dirt
was
to
delegate
to
the
contractor
the
authority
to
take
the
dirt
and
use
it
for
the
enlargement
project.
of
course
here,
we
also
make
the
additional
contention
that
the
trees
themselves
were
not
essential
to
this
project.
they,
of
course,
would
incorporate
it
into
the
levee
itself
and
they
were
just
destroyed
for
the
purpose
of
creating
an
area
from
which
the
dirt
could
be
obtained.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
they
--
they
require
that
those
cases
do
stand
for
the
proposition
perhaps
that
no
formal
procedure
is
required.
but
if
you
analyze
those
cases,
they
clearly
show
that
in
a
case
of
hardship
such
as
this
would
clearly
was,
this
property
owner
without
any
previous
notification
whatsoever
is
find
--
find
the
bulldozers
out
on
his
property
knocking
his
timber
over.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
sir,
even
if
there
was
a
purported
attempt
to
give
notice,
i
don't
know
if
i
just
covered
this
before
or
not,
the
levee
board,
actually,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
case
did
attempt
to
give
notice
to
some
property
owners
not
to
this
particular
one,
but
there
was
an
abortive
attempt
particularly
insofar
as
this
petitioner
was
concerned
in
as
much
as
the
notices
were
not
sent
out
until
sometime
in
october
when
the
petitioner's
property
had
been
--
the
destruction
had
commenced
some
several
months
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
i
think
the
customary
procedure,
sir,
is
for
the
levee
board
to
give
a
notice.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
the
government
told
the
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
no,
sir.
the
--
the
government
did
this.
they'd
said
we
would
--
wish
a
statement
from
you
to
the
effect
that
right-of-ways
are
available,
the
statement
may
--
may
be
in
a
form
of
a
letter.
the
government
could
have
itself
by
even
a
minimum
amount
of
check
and
you've
ascertained
what
steps
had
been
taken
or
had
not
been
taken
by
the
levee
board.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
no,
sir.
the
property
had
not
been
assessed
but
that
the
fact
of
his
ownership
could
have
been
ascertained
from
examination
of
the
conveyance
records.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
it
was
not
on
the
assessor's
list,
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
in
the
majority
of
them
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
in
the
majority
of
them,
there
were,
sir.
no,
i
won't
say
categorically
that
there
wasn't.
no
--
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
know
that
there
was
or
not.
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
yes,
sir.
well,
as
i
--
as
i
say,
it
looks
like
it
doesn't
matter
if
administrative
and
customary
practice
notice
is
given,
but
i
can't
--
can't
conceive
of
a
situation
in
which
the
imminent
danger
of
a
flooding
condition
would
dispense
with
any
--
mr.
edward
donald
moseley
well,
the
--
the
pruyn
case
briefly
touched
on
that
in
which
the
property
owner
was
claiming
--
claiming
compensation
for
the
dirt
taken
for
the
specific
purpose
of
using
on
the
levee
and
they
said
the
customary
method
there
of
appropriating
a
property
was
by
giving
notice
to
the
--
to
the
contractor.
however,
there
was
no
--
no
particular
issue
made
as
to
the
procedures.
i
say,
sir,
i
don't
believe
anybody
has
ever
made
a
real
genuine
issue
out
of
what
the
procedure
should
be
in
a
situation
like
this.
and
it
--
it
is
perhaps
something
that
should
be
made
a
little
--
a
little
more
specific
exactly
what
their
duties
are
beyond
the
concept
of
reasonableness.
i
would
like
to
save
a
brief
amount
of
time
for
rebuttal,
sir.
