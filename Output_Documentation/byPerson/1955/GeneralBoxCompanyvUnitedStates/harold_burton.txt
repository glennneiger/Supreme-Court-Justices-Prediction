if
they
are
appropriating
within

limits

aren't
they
just
appropriating
their
own
property?
can
they
do
it
in
their
own
way?

if
the
government
is
keeping
within
the
limits
of
its
servitude,
within
the
terms
of
the
servitude,
it's
then
exercising
its
own
right
in
the
property
and
therefore
it
doesn't
have
any
formalities
about
taking
it
away
if
it
wants
to,
does
it?

and
not
an

right

a
right
of

subject

certain

of

well,
what
(voice

what
you're
complaining
(voice

--
justice
harold

what
you're
complaining
about
is
not
the
appropriation
but
the
manner
in
which
the
appropriation
was
made,
is
that
it?
justice

in

justice

that
there's

are
you

and
you're
not

and
you're
not
complaining
then
about
the
right
of
appropriation
but
you're
claiming
the
way
they
exercise
their
right.
justice
harold
burton
in
other
words
--
justice
harold
burton
--
that
you
--
you're
claiming
that
something
like
this,
if
you
had
a
house
on
this
batture,
they
would
have
been
--
entirely
come
in
and
set
it
on
fire
just
in
order
to
get
rid
of
it,
they'd
have
to
give
you
a
chance
to
get
that
--
justice
harold
burton
--
house
only.
justice
harold
burton
but
you
--
you
don't
find
any
statutory
provisions
to
spell
that
out.
i
--
justice
harold
burton
well,
once
you
say
this
is
not
expropriation
taking
public
property
for
private
use,
why
do
you
talk
about
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
harold
burton
it's
an
informal
taking
and
therefore
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
it
although
it's
not
a
condemnation
proceeding?
justice
harold
burton
now,
i
come
back
to
you,
the
proposition
again.
your
main
contention
is
not
that
--
that
in
the
appropriation
but
in
the
manner
of
the
appropriation.
justice
harold
burton
and
you
don't
--
and
you
don't
find
any
statute
that
tells
you
how
you
should
do
it
but
you
find
it
in
this
--
in
the
cases,
you
believe.
justice
harold
burton
the
levee
board
involved
in
this
litigation
so
that
he
would
not
still
have
that
right?
justice
harold
burton
so
that
after
this
litigation,
he
will
not
be
able
to
sue
that
the
--
the
levee
board?
justice
harold
burton
but
it
--
justice
harold
burton
but
--
but
if
he
loses
here,
then
he
does
there
too?
justice
harold
burton
that's
not
settled?
