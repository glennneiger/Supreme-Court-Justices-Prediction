frankfurter
that's
what
you
--
that's
what
you
have
trade,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
we
must
be
careful
to
paraphrase
the
word
in
the
statute
and
then
argue
in
paraphrase
is
though
then
you
were
you
work
for
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
not
referring
to
its
title.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
trouble
with
the
--
that's
the
difficulty
and
the
problem
to
me
for
reasons
that
were
not
clear
to
me
but
they
don't
have
to
be.
the
congress
particularize
what
kind
of
obligations
of
the
--
of
a
corporation
which
may
fall
under
a
general
rubric
of
securities
of
the
tax
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
congress
hasn't
given
us
the
construction
of
application
by
the
all
embracing
categories
that
it
particularized
and
particularized
in
using
the
word
debentures
would
be
part
of
the
difficult
words
in
the
language,
to
read
the
language
of
the
secured
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
note,
i
recall
dealt
with
in
the
--
in
the
tax
letters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
on
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
you
say
this
type
of
thing
here
is
not
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
kind
of
--
the
kind
of
--
whatever
it
is
by
which
a
corporation
raise
its
money
within
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
notes
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
this
your
--
your
laws
or
that
the
--
is
that
your
rephrasing,
is
there
anything
in
--
in
treasury
practice
or
in
legislative
history
or
reported
committee
to
indicate
the
certificate
in
the
evidence
such
as
the
same
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
these
have
--
legislation
like
this
are
drawn
by
technical
people,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
had
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
goes
through
these
(inaudible)
joint
committee
of
the
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
permanent
staff
the
--
is
this
phrase
an
incurring
phrase
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
(inaudible)
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
this
restriction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
mean
--
of
course,
i
don't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
say
but
if
a
corporation
did
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
--
suppose
the
--
should
be
short
term
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
a
short
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hear
they
would
--
is
there
an
acceleration
clause
or
is
there
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
so
for
as
the
stated
fact
of
new
york
as
(inaudible)
has
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
about
the
banks
in
the
--
as
a
(inaudible)
that
are
also
the
insurance
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
casey,
before
you
sit
down,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
point
you
made
that
(inaudible)
just
to
the
question.
if
i
understood
you,
is
it
clear,
do
you
agree
(inaudible)
whether
this
is
a
debenture
and
that
the
rest
of
the
phrase
of
1939
or
certificate
of
indebtedness
is
not
before
us,
is
that
what
you
raise
of
the
law,
is
you're
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
i'm
troubled
about
that,
because
as
i
understood
the
conclusion
of
law,
the
district
judge
is
heard
to
--
well
they
said
instruments
are
not
bond
debentures
or
certificate
of
indebtedness
or
instrumentality
material.
when
i
look
at
the
court
of
appeals'
assertion
based
that
out
including
the
phrase
in
its
entirety
and
on
the
decision
for
certiorari
has
brought
the
case
here,
the
government
asked
it
to
consider
whether
this
is
(inaudible)
term
since
1939
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
defines
as
it
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
have
just
referred
into
what
i
read
as
a
finding
the
conclusions
of
law
in
which
the
district
judge
doesn't
say
i
find
it
is
a
debenture
in
order
the
court
of
appeals
merely
discuss
it
on
which
is
exclusively
with
reference
to
debenture
category.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
was
really
an
assumption
to
gather
the
phrase?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
why
is
that
the
--
why
isn't
the
question
whether
the
terms
within
that
phrase
in
the
statute
is
open
all
the
way
along?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
the
certificate
of
indebtedness,
could
you
explain
why
you
thought
it
was
a
debenture?
