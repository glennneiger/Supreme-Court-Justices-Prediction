mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
in
the
position
of
relying
on
the
regulations
in
this
case.
because
in
urging
a
reversal
and
the
great
weight
of
authority
on
the
point
in
the
appellate
courts
below,
the
united
states
will
also
put
itself
from
the
position
of
urging
a
repudiation
of
a
uniform
consisted
construction
of
the
statute
but
extended
over
a
period
of
30
years
during
which
the
leslie
notes
would
be
excluded
from
taxation
and
this
administrative
construction
survived
free
reenactments
of
the
statute,
including
the
reenactment
in
1939,
under
which
the
present
tax
is
sought
to
be
imposed.
this
same
construction
existed
for
at
least
14
years
after
the
private
placement
became
prominent.
it
existed
both
under
the
prior
regulations
and
for
seven
years
under
the
regulations
that
are
in
exist
today.
the
change
in
treasury
practice
came
about
solely
because
of
certain
unfortunate
language
in
a
second
circuit
decision
of
that
language
having
since
been
repudiated
in
result
by
the
same
court
and
the
language
is
also
not
been
followed
by
five
courts
of
appeals
which
have
considered
the
problem.
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
different
memories
of
the
same
court.
it
has
been
followed
by
one
court
of
appeals,
the
fourth
circuit.
in
that
case,
the
court
made
no
attempt
to
make
an
independent
analysis
starting
from
scratch
but
just
accepted
the
earlier
second
circuit
decision
at
face
value.
now,
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
this
is
a
holy
unknown
method
of
financing,
i
rely
on
the
--
on
a
pamphlet
that
the
government's
cites
in
its
brief
put
out
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
called
privately
place
securities
cause
of
votation.
at
page
two
of
that
pamphlet,
the
fcc
states
that
it's
incorrect
to
state
that
this
method
of
financing
was
wholly
unknown
of
the
earlier
years
of
the
century.
they
stated,
it
didn't
amount
too
much,
but
personally
speaking,
only
about
3.7%
between
1900
and
1934,
but
mr.
(inaudible),
also
cited
by
the
government,
at
page
--
1108
of
his
book,
states
that
the
total
amount
of
financing
done
this
way
between
1900
and
1934,
amounted
to
$1
billion,
so
it's
not
something
that
just
came
out
of
thin
air
in
recent
years.
it's
been
in
existent
for
some
time.
and
my
--
if
i
may
quote
again
from
the
securities
and
exchange
pamphlet
of
a
state
there,
that
in
1934,
23.2%
of
the
total
amount
of
corporate
debt
were
privately
placed.
i
won't
go
on
to
read
the
rest
that
they'd
use
because
the
--
it
follows
the
same
general
pattern.
but
the
administrative
construction
was
not
changed
until
1948,
it
has
conceded
the
--
in
m.t.
32
in
the
1948,
(inaudible)
the
court
will
know
that
m.t.
32,
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
32
of
my
brief,
and
running
on
to
page
33.
in
speaking
about
this
consistent
administrative
construction,
the
starting
place
is
1920.
prior
to
that
date,
there
have
been
a
few
tentative
(inaudible)
on
the
subject
of
what
purported
to
be
promissory
notes
that
were
--
which
were
essentially
debentures
or
bonds
but
no
comprehensive
attempt
have
been
made
to
classify
what
purported
the
promissory
note
of
which
were
really
bonds
or
debentures
on
the
one
hand
and
those
which
were
actually
promissory
notes
on
the
other.
but
in
1920,
the
attempt
was
made
in
regulations
55,
the
two
significant
articles
of
that
regulation
are
reproduced
at
page
25
of
my
brief
and
side
by
side
so
it's
simple
to
compare
it.
the
court
will
note
that
in
article
8
of
that
regulations
--
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
twenty-five
of
my
brief
your
honor.
in
article
8,
instruments
which
purported
to
be
promissory
notes
were,
nevertheless,
taxable
as
bonds
whether
they
were
called
bonds,
debentures,
or
notes
providing
they
were
issued
in
numbers
under
a
trust
indenture
and
then
registered
our
coupon
bearing
form.
on
the
other
hand,
article
48
states
that
instruments
that
don't
contain
those
provisions
and
which
purports
to
be
promissory
notes
are
taxes
promissory
notes,
and
the
less
we
note
fits
squarely
within
article
48
because
there
is
no
limitation
in
48
concerning
duration
or
amount.
the
two
factors
that
counsel
has
ceased
upon
is
apparently
shoving
an
instrument
into
in
the
classification
of
debentures.
and
at
the
time
these
regulations
came
out
according
to
the
scc,
according
to
mr.
(inaudible),
the
private
place
that
was
far
from
being
unknown,
it
--
it
amounted
to
a
significant
portion
of
the
total
corporate
flow.
with
these
two
regulations
before
it,
four
years
later,
congress
proceeded
to
repeal
the
tax
on
promissory
notes.
i
suggest
that
the
measure
of
the
type
of
instrument
that
the
tax
was
repealed
on
is
contained
in
article
48,
and
the
congressional
debate
has
certainly
doesn't
help
us
on
that
question
at
all.
i
would
like
to
also
add
at
this
point
that
article
8
of
regulation
55
was
carried
forward
without
any
change
at
all
in
the
language
through
several
reenactments
of
the
regulations
and
(voice
overlap)
the
same
when
the
statute
was
reenacted
in
1939
and
that
is
the
statue
under
which
the
present
tax
is
sought
to
be
imposed.
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
well,
48
was
dropped
in
the
tax
on
promissory
note
withdraw.
the
statute
was
again
reenacted
in
1926
with
no
attempt
made
to
expand
the
classification
of
taxable
instruments,
almost
immediately
after
the
regulations
were
again
reenacted
also
with
no
attempt
made
to
expand
the
classifications
of
--
of
taxable
instruments.
in
1941,
the
regulations
were
amended
and
took
the
form
they
have
today.
as
counsel
says,
the
regulations
state
that
whatever
the
name
the
document
contains
as
a
matter
of
answering
it
because
there's
no
attempt
made
to
state
what
are
the
essential
characteristics
of
bonds
or
debentures.
however,
under
the
present
regulations,
the
1941
regulations
has
conceded
in
m.t.
32
at
page
32
and
33
of
my
brief,
even
then,
the
treasury
construed
the
statute
is
not
imposing
a
tax
on
instruments
of
the
title
that
are
before
the
court
today.
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
i
think
the
treasury's
construction
was
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
debentures
are
instruments
that
are
issued
in
a
series
that
are
copied
by
a
trust
indenture
and
that
have
registrations
--
provisions
or
in
coupon
bearing
form.
i
think
the
treasury
was
accurate
then.
i
think
the
treasury's
construction
is
further
confirmed
by
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
this
case.
i
submit
that
with
that
administrative
history
before
us
that
these
documents
should
be
considered
not
debentures
as
a
matter
of
law
particularly
since
the
statute
was
reenacted
several
times
while
that
construction
still
was
in
effect.
and
i'll
repeat
that
the
only
reason
the
construction
was
changed
was
the
result
of
the
second
circuit
decision
which
another
panel
proceeded
to
virtually
destroy.
however,
if
that
construction
were
considered
in
any
way
dubious,
we
have
the
testimony
in
the
record
to
fall
back
on.
the
witness,
beckett,
an
employee
of
life
and
company
testified
as
an
expert
concerning
the
characteristics
of
debentures
at
the
term
as
used
and
understood
in
the
financial
world
of
--
the
sum
and
substance
of
his
testimony
was
that
debentures
were
instruments
that
were
prepared
in
the
form
to
meet
--
to
permit
the
public
treaty.
he
also
stated
that
they
were
accompanied
by
an
indenture
to
which
a
trustee
was
a
party
and
that
they
were
commonly
marketed
through
underwriters
that
so
far
as
the
ultimate
buyer
from
the
investing
public
was
concerned,
he
didn't
negotiate
at
all
as
to
terms
since
his
sole
decision
was
whether
he
was
going
to
buy
or
not
to
buy.
in
marked
contrast
to
the
negotiations
between
the
insurance
companies
and
leslie
salt,
where
the
insurance
companies
were
throughout
taking
the
initiative
and
opposing
terms
on
the
borrower
rather
than
the
converse.
the
testimony
of
the
witness,
beckett,
makes
particular
sense
when
we
go
through
the
provisions
of
article
8
in
the
light
of
that
testimony.
if
debentures
are
instruments
designed
for
public
trading
and
leslie
salt
had
issued
$4
million
in
debentures,
each
of
a
thousand
dollar
denomination,
certainly,
each
holder
of
$1000
debenture
wouldn't
have
been
given
a
loan
agreement
at
the
type
that
was
given
to
two
insurance
companies.
it
would
be
too
inconvenient,
too
expensive
for
the
debenture
holder
to
enforce
the
terms
of
the
loan
agreement
assuming
that
the
terms
were
violated.
for
that
reason,
each
holder
of
the
debenture
does
not
get
a
separate
accompanying
agreement,
what
he
gets
is
the
protection
of
a
trustee
to
enforce
the
rights
of
all
debenture
holders.
i'll
take
the
provision
for
registered
form
in
article
8.
now,
that
provision
makes
sense.
if
you
have
instruments
that
are
designed
for
public
trading
because
if
a
holds
a
debenture
today
and
b
tomorrow,
and
c
next
week,
you
have
to
have
some
provision
for
registration
so
that
payments
of
principal
and
interest
don't
go
astray
or
if
you
lack
a
provision
for
registration
of
the
necessity
of
submitting
coupons
of
the
same
reason.
so,
our
second
contention
is
that
the
correctness
of
the
prior
administrative
construction
is
confirmed
by
the
uncontradicted
testimony
of
the
receipt
and
the
record.
and
for
that
reason,
it
should
still
be
adhered
to
even
if
the
court
were
not
willing
to
give
weight
to
the
successive
reenactments
of
the
statute
while
the
construction
remained
unchanged.
our
third
contention
that
deals
solely
with
the
construction
of
the
words
of
a
statute
unaided
by
a
part
administrative
construction
and
unaided
by
the
testimony
and
i
refer
to
the
clause
that
mr.
justice
reed
mentioned
or
the
phrase
“all
instruments”
however
termed
issued
and
registered
form
or
with
attached
coupons.
i
think
it
is
correct
to
state
that
that
instrument
was
designed
to
catch
instruments
which
might
not
have
been
formally
taxable
unless
it
were
added.
it
was
added
in
1980.
to
me,
the
purpose
of
that
provision
is
obvious.
it
was
intended
to
tax
something
that
purported
to
be
a
promissory
note
and
not
a
debenture
or
certificate
of
indebtedness
but
which
did
have
the
same
general
characteristics
and
that
it
had
attached
coupons
or
a
provision
for
registration.
now,
we
ignore
that
1918
clause
and
tax
the
leslie
notes
despite
the
fact
they
don't
purport
to
be
debentures
or
certificates
of
indebtedness
and
are
not
issued
in
registered
form
or
with
attached
coupons,
i
submit
the
clause
has
been
read
out
of
the
statute.
and
for
that
reason,
since
one
of
the
most
elementary
rule
to
a
statutory
construction
would
be
violated,
just
on
the
words
of
the
statute,
the
decision
should
be
affirmed
here.
with
respect
to
this
contention
concerning
certificates
of
indebtedness,
there
is
a
long
administrative
gloss
to
that
phrase.
the
first
attempt
to
define
a
term
appears
in
appendix
a
of
my
brief,
treasury
decision
2713.
that
appears
at
the
bottom
of
the
second
page
of
the
--
of
the
treasury
decision,
your
honors.
however,
that
the
definition
there
contained
was
considered
too
broad
by
the
treasury
itself,
and
the
opinion
by
the
solicitor
of
the
treasury
was
put
out,
that
appears
as
appendix
c
in
which
he
states
that
he
thinks
that
prior
construction
is
too
broad
and
that
the
court
will
note
at
paragraph
3
of
page
8
of
that
appendix,
he
deals
with
it.
his
first
notes
that
debentures
are
issued
in
a
form
can
be
--
to
be
bought
and
sold
as
investments
which
of
course
is
our
contention
here.
then
he
states
the
term
"certificates
of
indebtedness"
has
also
come
to
have
in
commercial
use
as
similar
meaning
and
then
he
quotes
the
decision
by
this
court
in
which
the
court
states
that
certificates
of
indebtedness
are
practically
synonymous
with
bonds.
he
then
concludes
that
the
term
"certificates
of
indebtedness"
should
be
restricted
to
instruments
known
generally
as
investment
securities
and
the
definition
of
investment
securities
according
to
the
courts
in
this
country
has
always
been
instruments
that
are
designed
in
a
form
which
permits
their
public
treaty.
the
suggestions
of
the
solicitor
were
accepted
and
we
find
appendix
b
defining
certificates
of
indebtedness
as
instruments
having
the
general
character
of
investment
securities.
that
definition
was
done
a
way
with
in
1941
when
the
1941
regulations
came
out,
and
it
if
the
1941
regulation
just
stated
that
instruments
having
the
essential
characteristics
of
bonds,
or
certificate
of
indebtedness,
or
debentures
would
be
taxed
as
such,
however,
i
submit
the
essential
characteristics
of
certificates
of
indebtedness,
or
that
they
be
in
a
form
convenient
for
trading.
i'd
also
like
to
say
that
i
object
to
that
contention
of
the
government
even
being
considered
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
raised
below.
it
wasn't
even
mentioned
in
denying
the
claim
for
refund
or
a
trial.
it
was
mentioned
in
passing
before
the
court
of
appeals
but
never
pressed.
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
i
object
to
the
consideration
of
the
court
of
the
contention
that
these
instruments
are
certificates
of
indebtedness
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
properly
raised
below.
or
even
if
it
is
considered,
i
still
maintain
a
course
of
this
without
merit.
i
have
a
final
point
to
deal
with
and
that
concerns
the
provision
for
substitution
of
what
are
concededly
debentures
for
the
existing
obligation.
the
reason
for
that
provision
is
clear,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
insurance
companies
know
that
they
can't
possibly
sell
the
two
original
notes
that
they
have.
the
terms
are
too
high
and
that
there
might
be
--
excuse
me
--
the
denomination
is
too
high
to
permit
they're
readily
been
able
to
get
rid
of
them.
so
at
such
time
was
the
insurance
companies
want
dollars
instead
of
pieces
of
paper
or
they
would
have
to
have
entirely
new
instruments
created
so
that
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
trade
their
new
instruments
for
dollars.
and
at
such
time
as
these
new
instruments
are
created,
certainly,
they
have
debentures
and
a
tax
should
be
imposed.
but
that
is
not
to
stay
that
a
tax
should
be
imposed
on
original
documents
because
congress
was
clearly
concerned
with
taxing
documents
already
in
existence
not
hypothetical
ones
which
may
or
may
not
come
into
existence
in
the
future.
to
say
that
that
provision
makes
these
instruments
taxable,
it's
like
saying
that
if
a
group
of
partners
agreed
that
on
a
future
contingency,
they
may
or
may
not
form
a
corporation
that
they
now
have
to
start
paying
the
corporate
income
tax.
if
anything,
i
believe
that
provision
aids
our
case
and
that
it
demonstrates
in
concrete
form
a
right
within
the
corners
of
the
documents
themselves
and
the
differences
between
promissory
notes,
the
type
we
have
and
debentures
on
the
other
hand,
the
types
of
instruments
congress
intended
to
tax.
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
that's
--
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
the
government
--
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
the
government
say
the
point
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
am
--
i
am
saying
that
there
was
no
argument
made
on
the
point
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
yes

that's
right.
it's
--
the
--
the
conclusion

mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
the
conclusion
of
law
of
course
is
quoted
from

mr.
bruce
m.
casey,
jr.
that
may
be,
your
honor,
that
was
not
my
impression
of
--
as
to
the
practice
of
the
court.
and
as
i
say
i
don't
particularly
care
because
i'm
sure
there's
no
merit
to
the
contention
in
any
event.
however,
i
didn't
want
to
go
on
the
record
as
being
opposed
to
its
considerations.

bruce
m.
casey,
jr.

not
a
certificate
of
indebtedness,
your
honor,
because
of
the
past
treasury
practice
construing
the
term
"certificates
of
indebtedness."
