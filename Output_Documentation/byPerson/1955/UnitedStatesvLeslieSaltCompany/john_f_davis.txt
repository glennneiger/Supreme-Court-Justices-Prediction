mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
tax
case
involving
a
federal
documentary
stamp
tax
imposed
upon
the
issuance
of
corporate
debt
securities.
it
is
imposed
by
section
1801
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
and
it
corresponds
roughly
to
the
tax
which
is
imposed
upon
the
issuance
of
corporate
equity
securities,
corporate
stock.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
really
the
application
of
this
tax
provision
to
what
is
known
as
a
private
placement
as
distinguished
from
a
public
offering
of
these
securities.
leslie
salt
is
a
corporation
which
issued
two
instruments,
one
for
$1
million
payable
to
the
pacific
mutual
life
insurance
company,
and,
one,
for
$3
million
dollars
so
that
the
total
debt
was
$4
million
to
the
mutual
life
insurance
company
of
new
york.
now,
these
two
instruments,
one
of
which
is
reprinted
at
page
87
of
the
record,
are
called
sinking
fund
promissory
notes,
which
in
itself
is
an
unusual
term.
they
have
a
term
of
15
years
and
they
are
supported
by
a
loan
agreement,
which
was
simultaneously
entered
into
and
which
imposes
detailed
restrictions
upon
the
corporation's
policies
with
respect
to
financing,
business
and
its
dividend
policies.
on
demand
from
the
government,
stamp
--
stamp
taxes
were
fixed
to
these
documents.
the
corporation
then
petitioned
for
a
refund
which
was
refused
and
the
suit
for
a
refund
followed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
matter
of
fact
in
this
case,
the
--
there
was
a
letter
addressed
to
them
by
the
commission
in
saying,
we
believe
this
is
a
situation
which
requires
the
tax
and
you
--
when
you
put
a
tax
on.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
know,
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record.
it
is
--
it's
not
important
whether
there's
a
demand,
the
demand
isn't
a
formal
part
of
--
of
the
provision.
they
were
--
if
it
is
taxable,
they
were
required
to
put
a
stamp
on
it,
if
it
wasn't,
they
won't.
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
functional
part
of
this
case.
it
might,
just
as
well,
not
have
been
a
demand.
i
think
the
only
--
the
only
importance
of
the
demand
is
that
there's
no
concession
by
leslie
salt
that
this
was
a
taxable
transaction.
they
put
it
on
there
because
they
were
told
to
do
it,
not
because
they
thought
it
was
taxable
transaction.
the
taxpayer
asserts
that
its
instruments
are
not
debentures
within
the
meaning
of
the
statue
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
were
not
issued
under
an
indenture
and
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
trustee
involved.
the
government,
on
the
other
hand,
claims
that
these
instruments
are
taxable
as
corporate
debt
securities
being
both
debentures
and
certificates
of
indebtedness.
that
brings
us
to
the
statute
involved.
statutory
provisions,
section
1800
and
1801
are
reprinted
at
page
2
--
in
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief.
at
the
top
of
page
3
of
the
--
if
the
language
was
--
this
court
has
called
upon
to
construe,
that
the
language
which
describes
the
instruments
on
which
the
tax
--
the
stamp
tax
is
imposed,
it
reads
on
all
bonds,
debentures
are
certificates
of
indebtedness
issued
by
any
corporation.
those
are
the
--
those
are
the
words
that
we
believe
covered
this
situation.
the
note,
which
we
must
determine
much
as
must
examine
to
determine
whether
it
falls
within
that
language
is
reprinted
at
page
87
of
the
record.
the
loan
agreement
which
was
entered
into
simultaneously
with
the
note
follows
that
beginning
at
page
93
and
running
through
40
odd
pages
thereafter.
the
fact
that
these
instruments
are
called
notes
cannot
be
determinative
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
taxable.
there
are
many
corporate
securities,
which
publicly
issued,
it's
enlisted
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
which
i
--
which
i've
called
--
commonly
called
"notes."
but
they
are
admittedly
bonds
or
debentures
as
the
treasury
regulations
provided
cannot
be
the
--
the
name
that
the
issuer
gives
these
documents
which
controls,
rather
it
must
be
their
own
essential
characteristics.
now,
the
characteristics
of
these
particular
instruments
are
that
there
were
two
documents
evidencing
a
promise
to
pay
a
very
substantial
sum
of
money,
they
were
issued
for
a
relatively
long
term,
15
years.
capital
was
to
be
useful
for
capital
purposes,
the
corporation
wanted
working
capital.
and
what's
even
more
important,
they
were
supported
by
these
loan
agreement
to
which
i
have
referred
which
in
its
terms
is
comparable
to
the
ordinary
indenture
which
is
issued
with
what
is
formally,
what
are
formally
called
"debentures."
in
all
essentials
these
are
the
kind
of
instruments,
which
if
they
were
sold
to
the
general
public
in
an
ordinary
distribution
would
be
recognized
by
everybody
as
being
corporate
debt
securities
to
which
this
tax
is
applicable.
and
the
only
reason
that
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
debt
securities,
no,
no
it
doesn't.
if
the
title
of
the
discorporate
securities,
that's
the
term
of
the
--
the
term
in
the
code
is
corporate
securities
which
is
even
brought.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
take
two
great
liberties
when
the
title
is
security.
the
important
thing
is
--
is
securities
and
the
title
is
corporate
securities.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
but
it
is
part
of
this
--
this
is
part
of
the
code.
it's
not
something
which
is
put
in
--
in
the
--
by
the
publishers.
the
--
the
reason
that
we
have
this
question
at
all,
i
think
the
reason
that
--
that
the
issue
was
before
us
is
that
these
securities
were
not
issued
to
the
public,
they
were
issued
in
two
large
pieces
to
insurance
companies.
mr.
john
f.
davis
why
do
i
use
the
word
security,
because
basically
our
question
is
whether
these
are
securities
which
have
--
have
--
to
which
a
stamp
tax
should
be
abide
or
whether
these
are,
let's
say,
bank
loans
to
which
the
tax
would
not
be
applicable.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
these
are
not
secured,
there
is
no
mortgage
that
it
is
involved,
but
many
securities,
your
honor,
do
not
have
any
formal
pledge
of
--
of
security
behind
them.
i
mean
the
ordinary
debenture
pledges
the
general
credit
of
the
corporation
as
this
does.
and
the
debenture
is,
of
course,
generally
treated
as
a
security.
and
as
far
as
that
goes,
the
very
terms
of
the
--
of
the
stock
and
statute
applied
in
debentures
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
would
have
still
been
taxable
and
i
would
come
to
that
a
little
later.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
also
used
the
catch-all
phrase
with
certificate
of
indebtedness.
they
start
in
by
saying
corporate
securities
and
then
use
these
particular
terms.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
at
the
present
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
at
the
present
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
at
the
time
--
not
at
any
time
which
is
important
to
this
particular
case.
there
is
a
history
with
respect
to
notes
which
i'll
come
to
in
--
in
just
a
minute.
i
wonder
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
as
a
particular
clause,
these
--
these
are
not
registered
and
do
not
have
coupons
and
they
do
not
fall
within
that
clause.
there's
no
question
that
these
particular
notes
were
not
registered.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
do
not
fall
within
that
part
of
the
paragraph
which
deals
with
registered
securities
or
securities
with
coupons
attached.
that
is
a
clause
which
was
added
in
the
1918
to
the
--
to
the
general
paragraph
to
make
sure
that
these
particular
kinds
of
instruments
were
attacked.
mr.
john
f.
davis
very
frequently,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
comes
under
clause
of
the
statutes
which
says
on
all
bonds,
debentures
are
certificates
of
indebtedness.
and
it
is
our
--
it
is
our
contention
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right
because
that
does
not
modify
the
first
part.
that
modifies
only
the
--
the
portion
which
was
added
in
1918
which
went
on
and
--
and
said
and
all
instruments,
however,
termed
issued
by
any
corporation
with
interest
coupon
are
--
are
in
registered
form,
which
was
added
to
--
to
codify
a
--
an
internal
revenue
interpretation
that
if
an
instrument
was
registered,
or
had
coupons
attached,
then
it
was
clearly
taxable
on
any
--
under
any
circumstances.
but
that
doesn't
modify
the
first
clause
which
is
all
bonds,
debentures,
or
certificates
of
indebtedness
issued
by
any
corporation
which
preexisted
in
the
law
and
this
other
was
added
to
take
care
of
its
specific
interpretation.
private
placements
are
irrelatively
new
method
of
--
of
financing.
it
involves
selling
a
security
to
a
restricted
number
of
purchases
instead
of
distributing
it
through
investment
bankers
to
the
general
public.
the
witness
for
the
taxpayer
estimates
that
this
method
of
financing
rarely
commenced
in
about
1947.
in
any
--
in
any
rate,
it's
drawn
to
a
great
rapidity
in
recent
years
studied
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
indicates
that
there
were
$11
billion
of
corporate
securities
which
were
privately
placed
between
1946
and
1951
and
the
private
placements
constituted
44%
of
all
corporate
offerings
in
the
year
1951.
but
what
is
really
significant
if
not
the
size
of
this
method
of
financing
but
that
what
the
corporations
were
selling
through
this
method
is
essentially
the
same
thing
that
they
were
selling
through
public
offerings
before.
now,
the
reason
that
the
taxpayer
places
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
these
instruments
are
called
"notes"
as
such
is
that
at
one
time,
promissory
notes
in
checks
and
drafts
were
subject
to
taxation
under
a
separate
provision
of
the
tax
law.
then
in
1924,
i
think
it
was,
this
separate
provision
of
taxing
promissory
notes,
checks,
and
drafts
was
refilled.
and
these
taxpayers'
argument
that
congress
showed
by
the
repeal
of
that
separate
provision
taxing
those
particular
instruments
an
intent
not
to
tax
the
kind
of
instrument
which
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
now,
at
the
time
congress
acted
in
this
way,
private
placement
were
--
were
not
used
as
a
--
as
a
method
of
financing.
promissory
notes
were
the
ordinary
commercial
paper,
short
term
paper
which
was
issued
by
facts.
these
instruments
which
are
here
involved,
although
they're
called
sinking
fund
promissory
notes
are
very
different
from
the
ordinary
negotiable
instrument,
promissory
note
which
a
bank
--
which
a
bank
takes
for
--
for
a
short
time
loan.
one
thing,
they
have
a
maturity
of
15
years
or
another
thing
they're
issued
in
connection
with
a
loan
agreement
which
is
a
40-paged
document
and
which
is
certainly
not
ordinarily
used
in
connection
with
--
with
notes.
so,
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
when
congress
repealed
a
separate
tax
on
promissory
notes
in
1944,
they
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
expressed
any
intent
with
rather
these
particular
instruments
which
are
before
the
court
in
which
that
method
of
financing
not
being
invoked
at
that
time,
they
--
they
knew
nothing
about
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
anything
with
respect
to
this
particular
situation.
and
i
may
say
the
same
thing
is
true
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
type
of
transaction.
they
knew
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
knew
about
debentures
and
bonds
but
they
did
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
did
not
--
they
were
not
--
they
were
not
at
that
time
--
this
--
that
was
not
the
type
of
note
at
that
time
unless
it
was
called
a
debenture
and
was
issued
to
the
public
because
they
didn't
sell
this
kind
of
thing
to
the
bank
at
that
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it
would
--
if
you
--
one
walked
into
a
bank
and
said
i
want
to
borrow
$4
million
in
a
non-secured
note
before
--
for
over
15
years
why
they
shouldn't
do
it,
i
mean,
that
requires
security.
it's
a
different
kind
of
--
of
a
--
different
kind
of
a
transaction
and
it's
grown
up
sincerely.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
think
that
this
--
that
the
name
--
the
name
isn't
important
as
the
essential
characteristic
and
by
calling
this
thing
a
promissory
note,
doesn't
move
it
from
one
--
wouldn't
have
moved
it
from
one
class
of
taxation
to
another.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
i've
include
--
secluded
some
dictionary
definitions
in
our
brief
which
are
really
just
a
glorified
promissory
notes.
it's
used
in
various
ways.
it's
used
in
one
way
to
distinguish
a
formal
sort
of
an
instrument,
of
a
promise
to
pay
a
formal
sort
from
the
ordinary
short
time
negotiable
instrument's
note.
it's
used
on
the
other
hand
to
distinguish
a
--
obligation
to
which
it
pledges
the
general
credit
of
the
corporation
and
this
is
american
usage
rather
than
english
usage.
but
it
pledges
the
general
credit
of
the
corporation
to
a
long
term
obligation
rather
than
being
a
--
a
pledge
of
--
of
real
estate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it's
--
it's
--
i
think
in
american
financial
usage,
it's
--
it's
really
intended
to
distinguish
mortgage
funds
from
bonds
which
aren't
secured
by
mortgages.
that's
--
that's
an
essence
what
the
--
the
financial
community
thinks
of
as
a
debenture.
if
it
--
if
it
--
if
definitions
of
debentures
are
helpful,
we
have
included
coming
from
the
financial
tax
from
the
general
dictionaries
and
the
--
and
the
definitions
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
court
at
pages
20
through
page
22
of
our
brief.
then,
they
roughly
say
that
it's
a
formal
sort
of
promissory
note,
which
i
think
is
what
we
have
here.
but
i
think
we
need
not
be
too
much
concerned
with
even
with
the
formal
definition
of
debentures.
it
is
our
research
in
this
case
that
these
instruments
are
not
only
debentures
but
they're
also
certificates
of
indebtedness.
several
of
the
courts
which
have
passed
upon
this
question
have
said,
well,
these
aren't
either
debentures
or
their
certificates
of
indebtedness,
we
don't
have
to
decide
which,
the
one
or
the
other.
now,
actually
the
phrase
"certificates
of
indebtedness"
seems
to
have
been
included
in
the
statute
not
as
a
term
of
art
because
it
isn't
the
term
which
is
used
in
the
financial
industry,
rather
it's
used
as
--
as
a
catch-all
through
snare,
debt
securities
which
escaped
from
beneath
the
ordinary
financial
terms
which
are
used
in
wall
street.
he
corresponds
to
the
definition
of
securities
in
the
--
in
the
securities
act
where
securities
are
defined
among
other
things
as
bonds,
debentures,
or
evidences
of
indebtedness.
it's
an
attempt
to
use
nontechnical
language
to
be
sure
that
there
is
no
slipping
through
the
statute
by
using
a
term
which
is
not
--
which
hasn't
been
used
in
the
past.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
i
think
--
that
i
think
that
certificate
of
indebtedness
used
at
the
--
serves
the
same
purpose
because
it
is
in
the
term
of
art.
mr.
john
f.
davis
certificate
of
indebtedness,
it
is
a
term
in
--
of
art
in
the
restricted
sort
of
sense
which
it
wasn't
used
in
here
of
the
--
the
government
issues
certificates
of
indebtedness
in
connection
with
tax
anticipation
in
one
or
two
things
like
that,
but
that's
not
the
way
it's
used
here.
it's
used
here,
i
think,
as
a
catch-all
phrase,
a
--
it's
a
general
description.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
in
the
history.
i
just
--
i
just
have
been
unable
to
find
any
instruments
which
are
called,
which
makes
sense
in
this
context,
which
would
be
called
as
a
technical
matter,
certificates
of
indebtedness.
they
--
it's
just
not
just
a
term
which
is
--
which
is
a
technical
term.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
certainly
is.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
phrase
has
been
in
the
statute
since
1914
or
something
like
that,
maybe
before,
maybe
it
was
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
would
be
our
contention
--
it
is
my
contention,
it
would
be
taxable
as
a
bond
debenture
or
certificate
of
indebtedness
that
it
is
not
in
essence
a
--
a
promissory
note.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
law
--
yes
its
--
its
characteristics
of
those
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
that
--
but
roughly
speaking,
i
--
yes
i
would
think
it
would
be
if
it
wouldn't
be
a
capital
transaction
to
be
at
bank
loan
in
the
90-day
--
a
90-day
transaction.
probably
--
probably
three
months,
probably
six
months,
i
don't
where
and
when
to
draw
the
line.
it'd
be
the
ordinary
bank
loan
rather
than
the
(inaudible)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
not
only
the
term,
your
honor.
the
term
is
very
important
but
also
important
is
the
--
this
loan
agreement
which
is
the
same
thing
as
--
as
a
trust
indenture
because
that
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
generally
used
in
connection
with
the
promissory
note.
that
is
the
kind
of
an
instrument
which
is
used
in
connection
with
the
bond
or
--
or
a
debenture.
and
--
and
with
reason
because
promissory
note
is
done
on
a
current
examination
of
the
--
of
the
debt
disability
to
pay
whereas
a
long
term
indebtedness
requires
these
restrictions
on
the
--
on
the
debtors
activities
in
order
to
secure
it.
i
want
to
refer
to
the
case
lore
on
this
subject
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
was
not.
oh
--
oh
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
john
f.
davis
at
the
time
this
was
passed,
yes.
this
--
this
particular
stamp
tax
--
i
think
it
came
in
1914
and
at
the
same
time,
they
passed
this
--
this
tax
on
bonds
and
a
separate
tax
provision
on
promissory
notes,
checks
and
drafts.
they
were
simultaneous.
they
were
separate
sections
and
separate
schedules
and
a
lot.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right
even
if
it
was
applied
to
--
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
war
time
tax,
it
was
an
excise
tax.
the
reason
it
was
repealed
was
that
--
from
the
legislative
history
it
appears,
it
seemed
unfair
when
a
man
was
so
poor
that
he
had
to
go
around
and
borrow
money
at
the
bank
that
he
should
then
have
to
pay
the
united
states
tax
to
--
in
order
to
borrow
money.
and
they
--
when
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
well
that
would
apply
whether
it
were
to
a
bank
or
--
or
individual,
that
didn't
make
any
difference
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
--
he
--
the
man
is
so
poor,
he
--
he
can't
buy
his
food,
he
goes
to
the
bank
to
borrow
money
and
they
say
and
in
addition
to
the
interest,
do
you
have
to
pay
the
government?
well,
that's
a
different
thought
of
situation
that
we
have
here.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
would
be
different
because
they're
exempted
from
stamp
tax.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
if
a
corporation
issues
what
on
--
on
the
nature
of
securities
which
are
distributed,
certainly,
that
--
that
they
would
be
notes
which
are
--
sold
to
the
public,
it
fairly
be
--
be
taxable.
if
they
go
to
a
bank
and
make
a
30-day
loan,
it
wouldn't
be
taxable.
mr.
john
f.
davis
for
a
short
period?
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
probably
knew
or
probably
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
probably
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
provision
for
repayment
on
payment
of
a
premium
here,
just
as
there
is
in
the
case
of
debenture.
there's
a
good
deal
of
case
law
on
this
particular
provision.
the
case
is
actually
go
in
all
directions.
the
only
way
that
one
can
make
a
pattern
out
of
them
is
to
distinguish
between
banks
and
insurance
companies.
generally
speaking,
if
there
is
a
pattern
for
the
cases,
it
is
that
when
the
security
is
sold
to
a
bank,
it
is
not
taxable
when
it
is
sold
to
an
insurance
company,
and
here
we
have
an
insurance
company,
it
is
taxable.
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
had
virtual
--
virtual
logic,
it
has
a
little
logic
because
banks
are
in
the
business
of
lending
and
an
insurance
company
is
not.
but
unfortunately,
there
are
many
situations
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
banks
are
in
the
business
of
lending.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
this
is
difficult.
also,
many
times,
the
corporation
will
divide
the
same
notes
between
banks
and
insurance
company.
it
makes
further
the
sense
to
say
that
part
of
them
would
be
taxable
and
part
of
them
wouldn't.
one
of
the
most
illuminating
decisions
on
this
case
is
a
recent
case
out
of
the
second
circuit
in
which
judge
collin
wrote
the
majority
opinion
and
in
which
he
found
an
issue
of
notes
to
a
bank,
a
big
issue
of
notes
to
a
bank
was
not
taxable
because
it
was
a
loan.
now,
i
think
that
the
position
which
we
are
taking
here
is
reconcilable
with
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
in
that
particular
case.
in
that
particular
case,
emphasis
is
placed
upon
the
fact
that
in
the
transaction,
there
was
no
language
of
purchase
and
sale,
rather
it
was
passed
language
of
borrowing
and
lending.
in
this
case,
the
language
is
the
language
of
purchase
and
sale.
in
that
case,
the
lender
was
a
bank
and
some
emphasis
was
laid
on
that
in
the
opinion.
in
this
case,
we
have
an
insurance
company.
in
that
case,
the
--
there
was
no
provision
for
redemption
with
the
premium.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
provision
for
a
premium
on
--
on
prepayment
which
is
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
debentures.
but
even
more
important,
that
case
places
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
the
banks
were
getting
instruments
which
were
not
marketable.
they
couldn't
be
resolved.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
the
insurance
companies
can
demand
that
the
notes
be
broken
down
into
smaller
pieces
which
admittedly
would
be
debentures,
issued
under
a
trust
indenture
with
a
trustee
and
then
resolved
so
that
there
is
a
marketability
of
this
obligation
in
this
case.
so,
i
--
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
even
on
the
--
in
the
language
of
--
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
niles-bement-pond
case
that
this
--
this
case
would
still
be
taxable.
it
is
a
peculiar
--
it
would
be
a
peculiar
interpretation
of
--
of
this
provision
if
it
were
to
permit
more
than
half
of
the
debt
securities,
capital
debt
securities
issued
by
corporations
to
escape
taxation.
and
yet,
that
is
precisely
what
would
--
what
would
result
if
this
particular
transaction
is
held
not
to
be
taxable.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
regulations
merely
provide
in
--
in
effect
that
the
name
doesn't
control
and
then
it's
a
matter
of
the
essential
characteristics
of
the
instrument.
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
particular,
your
honor,
only
in
the
sense
that
it
would
negate
the
thought
that
because
these
are
called
promissory
notes,
that's
an
end
of
it.
it
doesn't
indicate
that,
that's
as
far
as
it
goes
in
helping
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
haven't
been
a
long
type
of
finance.
this
is
a
--
is
a
new
development.
mr.
john
f.
davis
been
from
about
--
while
the
witness
puts
it
in
starting
in
47
years,
let's
say
it's
the
last
10
years
that
it's
--
that
it's
drawn.
well,
the
--
the
regulation
has
--
has
been
in
effect
that
it's
the
essential
characteristics
and
the
--
and
the
tax
people
have
taken
the
position
these
things
were
taxable
and
it's
been
in
litigation,
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
--
to
deal
with
it
specifically
in
the
regulations,
but
there's
been
a
consistent
position
since
the
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
case
that
these
things
are
taxable.
may
i
preserve
and
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
seems
to
be
something
of
an
issue
between
me
and
mr.
casey
as
to
when
private
placements
commenced.
and
i
think
it's
partially
due
to
the
fact
that
my
statement
was
much
more
definite
than
the
facts
perhaps
were
justified.
the
big
growth
in
this
method
of
financing
is
a
recent
--
is
a
recent
development.
i
quote,
if
i
may,
from
the
record
where
the
taxpayer's
own
expert
was
asked,
when
did
this
method
of
financing
become
popular?
and
mr.
beckett
said,
"it
is
a
method
of
rather
recent
origin
if
you
considered
the
years
1947,
i
guess
it's
when
it
became
inconsiderable
vote."
and
that
is
roughly
the
--
the
period
when
it
grew
from
small
occasional
use
into
a
recognized
method
of
--
of
proper
financing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
that
five-year
period,
there
were
$11
billion
of
securities
marketed
in
this
way
whereas
regarding
to
the
figures
which
mr.
casey
has
mentioned
to
doing
something
like
1
billion
from
1900
to
1930.
