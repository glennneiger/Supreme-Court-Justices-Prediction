what
--
what
change
does
that
make
and
what
was
it
before?
justice
stanley
reed
well,
mr.
dunne,
the
--
use
of
the
phrase
"affect
such
commerce"
at
--
at
this
time,
that's
--
that's
almost
a
phrase
of
art
of
the
1939
birth
period,
was
it
not,
affect
such
commerce?
justice
stanley
reed
and
a
part
of
--
of
the
doctrine
of
affecting
commerce
--
justice
stanley
reed
but
is
this
--
that
an
officer
to
the
supreme
court
doctrine
that
has
come
on
down
to
us
that
the
affecting
commerce
so
as
to
give
the
broadest
constitutional
reach
possible
to
the
economy
--
justice
stanley
reed
--
the
commerce
clause?
justice
stanley
reed
would
it
--
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
under
the
statute,
from
your
point
of
view
interpreted,
any
employee
of
a
carrier,
any
part
of
whose
duties
shall
be
the
furtherance
so
that
you
would
apply
the
old
1939
test
as
to
whether
they
were
engaged
in
commerce
or
not.
and
if
they
were
at
any
part
of
their
employment,
then
they
would
be
under
no
matter
whether
they
were
at
the
moment
or
not
in
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
justice
stanley
reed
that's
right.
justice
stanley
reed
when
i
--
when
i
look
at
the
report
and
its
principle
back
in
mr.
dunne's
brief,
the
preponderance
of
service
performed
by
railroad
transportation
employees
is
an
interstate
commerce.
as
to
those
who
are
constantly
shifting
from
one
class
of
service
to
another,
the
adoption
of
the
amendment
will
provide
uniform
treatment.
justice
stanley
reed
do
i
need
to
go
farther
than
that?
justice
stanley
reed
are
you
familiar
with
the
raymond
case?
justice
stanley
reed
was
--
was
that
an
improvement
of
--
method
too?
justice
stanley
reed
yes.
