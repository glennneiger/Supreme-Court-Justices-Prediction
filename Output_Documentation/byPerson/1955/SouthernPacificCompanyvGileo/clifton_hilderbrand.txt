mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
two
carmen,
one
is
gileo
and
the
other
is
eelk.
that's
spelled
e-e-l-k
but
pronounced
eelk.
mr.
perkins,
who's
sitting
next
here
appears
for
mr.
eufrazia
another
carman
and
mr.
colley
who's
next
to
mr.
perkins
appears
for
aranda,
the
laborer
in
the
retarder
yard
and
moreno
who
was
the
molder
in
the
car
foundry.
the
--
my
associates
have
kindly
consented
that
i
might
bear
something
of
the
burden
of
the
argument
but
they
would
like
to
be
heard
as
to
the
special
facts
of
their
cases
and
consequently
since
the
gileo
case
was
the
main
opinion
of
the
court
you
might
say,
supreme
court
of
california,
i
shall
attempt
to
discuss
the
burden
of
the
argument
relating
particularly
though
to
these
carmen.
now,
under
the
old
conception
before
1939
and
all
these
cases
which
mr.
dunne
told
you
about
arose
always
before
1939.
all
these
new
car
--
new
yard
construction
cases
were
before
1939,
he
hasn't
given
you
any
decisions
since
1939
on
that.
and
prior
to
1939,
the
whole
situation
had
got
to
be
such
a
mess
that
the
railroad
brotherhoods
went
to
congress
on
these
lunch
box
cases
and
a
switchman
working
one
minute
in
interstate
commerce
and
the
next
minute
in
local
commerce,
that
mr.
mcgrath
representing
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
that
i
have
represented
for
many
years
and
other
brotherhoods
went
to
the
congress
and
they
asked
the
congressional
committee
and
particularly
the
senate
committee
that
was
considering
this
matter
and
primarily
interested
in
trying
to
remedy
these
defects
to
do
something
about
this
moment
of
injury
thing
and
all
of
these
problems,
it
wasn't
just
a
moment
of
injury,
it
was
to
get
away
from
these
borderline
cases,
from
these
hairline
distinctions
where
a
man
had
to
take
four
years
to
find
out
where
his
remedy
was.
it
was
the
most
ridiculous
situation
that
he
would
be
situated
where
he's
a
switchman
in
the
yard
and
we
got
two
tracks
here
and
on
the
first
track,
if
he's
injured
on
the
first
track
handling
one
car,
he's
under
local
commerce
and
if
his
fellow
worker
on
the
second
track
is
injured,
he's
handling
interstate
commerce.
and
there
wasn't
any
question
in
anybody's
mind
about
it.
there
wasn't
any
argument
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
or
in
the
legislature
that
these
things
should
be
remedied.
it
was
a
ridiculous
situation
and
the
courts
had
floundered
around
on
the
thing
to
the
point
where
you
couldn't
tell
where
a
man
stood,
and
it
wished
to
sweep
away
this
whole
line
of
decisions
that
mr.
dunne
is
talking
about
and
to
bring
about
a
new
era
so
that
the
man
and
the
brotherhoods
and
the
people
concerned
with
the
rights
of
these
men
wouldn't
know
within
reason
and
with
some
clearcut
the
lines
of
distinction
where
they
could
go
and
where
the
remedy
was.
this
whole
maze
of
law
that
mr.
dunne
discusses
and
tells
you
about
is
in
the
limbo
of
the
nocuous
destitute.
it's
no
longer
with
us.
it's
past
1939
and
it
shouldn't
even
be
discussed,
this
broad
language
of
this
new
amendment
in
1939
threw
it
out
the
window.
it's
no
longer
with
us
and
the
language
said,
what
did
it
say,
why
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce
directly,
closely
or
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce.
well,
that's
quite
different
from
the
old
conception,
here's
the
old
conception.
in
the
old
conception
as
they
worked
out
on
the
shanks
case,
here
would
be
transportation,
this
is
the
lectern
transportation
and
then
if
the
man
is
here,
he's
in
any
part
of
the
lectern,
he's
on
transportation.
but
the
new
concept
is
not
just
transportation,
it's
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce
if
this
is
meeting
up
there
in
the
table
or
that
table
or
others
leaving
on
up
to
this
lectern.
if
it's
anything
relating
to
interstate
commerce
of
the
employer,
if
the
employee's
work
relates
to
interstate
commerce,
if
it's
directly
or
closely
substantially
connected
with
interstate
commerce
not
just
transportation,
not
just
this
lectern,
the
entire
sweep
of
activity
of
the
railroad
in
interstate
commerce
and
that's
the
broadening
of
the
language
which
we
have.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
no,
i
think
they
need
some
intelligent
judgment
in
figuring
out
just
where
they
are
and
in
trying
to
draw
the
line,
i
still
believe
that
there
will
be
problems
and
cases
we
cannot
entirely
solve
it
but
look
how
simple
this
thing
is.
here,
you
have
men,
let's
take
our
carmen.
we
have
three
carmen
involved
in
this
situation.
this
carshop
that
mr.
dunne
speaks
about
is
not
a
shop,
there's
no
roof
over
it,
you've
got
10
parallel
tracks
just
as
if
let's
say
this
courtroom
was
the
carshop,
i
happen
to
notice
that
starting
with
the
first
line
of
chairs
here,
there
are
10
chairs
--
10
rows.
this
carshop
that
mr.
dunne
talks
about,
these
yards
there
in
the
sacramento
yards
of
the
southern
pacific
are
10
tracks.
now,
on
the
first
track,
this
very
first
track
right
along
here,
they
do
running
repairs.
that
is
to
say
trains
come
in,
cars
need
a
little
work
done
on
them,
they're
in
service,
they're
in
transportation
and
some
of
these
men
were
down
there
and
they
work
on
these
running
repairs.
in
the
second
track,
they
bring
in
cars
that
go
to
eight,
nine
and
ten
where
they
build
new
cars.
on
the
third
track,
the
track
right
back
there,
this
side
of
the
railing,
they
bring
cars
in
there
that
are
to
be
painted
or
repainted
from
running
repairs,
from
the
trains
and
service
and
they
paint
new
cars
and
they
paint
old
cars
on
the
third
track.
on
the
next
tracks,
four,
five,
six
and
seven,
they
are
repairing
old
cars
and
rebuilding
cars,
heavy
repairs.
and
on
tracks
eight,
nine
and
ten,
they're
building
new
cars.
now,
what
do
you
have?
you
have
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
carmen
whom
i
represented
for
years.
these
men
have
a
contract
with
the
railroad.
they
have
interchangeable
seniority.
one
of
them
is
working
one
day
on
track
one,
he's
working
another
day
on
track
three,
he's
working
another
day
on
track
eight
and
nine.
these
men
can
bid
the
jobs
according
to
their
seniority.
if
i
have
10
years
as
seniority
or
15
years
as
seniority
and
i
like
a
job
over
there
or
on
track
eight
or
nine
or
ten
and
my
seniority
entitles
me
to
that
job,
i
can
go
over
there
or
if
my
seniority
entitles
me
to
get
on
here
on
track
one
or
track
three
where
there's
running
repairs,
i
can
go
there.
my
contract
covers
--
this
contract
i
work
on,
there
was
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
covers
my
seniority
rights
and
my
work
is
interchangeable
with
the
other
men
that
i
work
with.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
the
choice
is
interchangeable
and
the
work
is
interchangeable.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
correct.
in
the
eelk
case
for
instance
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
i
know
it,
your
honor,
but
this
record
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
on
it
in
the
eelk
case.
and
i'll
state
it
and
then
i'll
get
the
record
for
your
honor.
in
the
eelk
case,
eelk
was
one
month
on
running
repairs.
the
next
month,
he
was
on
new
construction.
the
next
month,
he
was
on
running
repairs
and
the
next
month
when
he
was
injured,
he
was
on
new
construction.
now,
isn't
that
the
fact,
mr.
dunne?
i
don't
think
i
need
to
get
the
record
on
that,
do
i?
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
oh,
that's
done.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
i
don't
think
so
because
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
well
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
they
all
work
interchangeably,
your
honor.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
the
testimony
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
i
didn't
--
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
argument
about
it.
the
record
is
clear
on
it.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
i
--
i
appreciate
that
your
honor
is
simply
asking
question,
but
i'm
sure
you'll
find
i'm
not
misstating
the
record
to
the
court.
in
the
case
that
mr.
perkins
had
--
has,
the
eufrazia
case.
eufrazia
worked
for
nine
months
on
the
work
that's
like
number
one
and
number
three
track,
that's
the
running
repairs.
the
--
the
cars
in
service
and
then
one
month
he'd
worked
on
the
new
car
construction
and
he
was
injured.
in
the
gileo
case,
gileo
had
worked
for
10
years
on
general
work,
that
is
to
say
running
repairs
and
old
construction
on
cars
and
service.
and
it
happened
that
for
five
months,
he'd
been
working
up
on
the
new
car
construction.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
well,
i
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
it
was
one
thing.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
it
was
one
thing
he
was
talking
about,
but
they
were
talking
about
a
lot
of
things.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
the
report
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
well,
here
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
here
is
the
language.
it's
in
the
appendix
at
page
4,
your
honor.
that's
at
appendix
a
to
mr.
dunne's
brief.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
adoption
of
the
proposed
amendment
will
to
a
very
large
extent
eliminate
the
necessity
of
determining
whether
an
employee
at
the
very
instant
of
his
injury
or
death
was
actually
engaged
in
the
movement
of
interstate
traffic.
if
any
part
of
the
employees
do
these
at
the
time
of
his
injury
or
death
directly
closely
or
substantially
affected
interstate
or
foreign
commerce,
the
claimant
would
be
considered
entitled
the
benefits
of
the
act.
now,
this
is
the
next
paragraph.
the
preponderance
of
service
performed
by
railroad
transportation
employees
is
an
interstate
commerce.
as
to
those
who
are
constantly
shipping
--
shifting
from
one
class
of
service
to
another,
the
adoption
of
the
amendment
will
provide
uniform
treatment
in
the
event
of
injury
or
death
while
so
employed.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
well,
i
think
that
certainly
where
you've
got
a
man
like
eelk,
for
one
month
he's
in
one
class
of
employment,
the
next
month
he's
in
another
class
of
employment.
back
again
to
the
first
and
back
again
to
the
first
in
a
period
of
four
months
going
back
and
forth.
you've
got
them
all
on
the
same
seniority
list.
you've
got
them
all
under
the
railroad
retirement
act.
you've
got
them
all
under
the
railway
labor
act.
they
negotiate
under
the
federal
railway
labor
act
to
all
of
these
men.
their
contracts
are
under
the
railway
labor
act.
their
retirement
benefits
are
under
the
railway
retirement
act.
their
unemployment
insurance
is
under
the
unemployment
insurance
act.
if
they
get
injured,
they
are
--
they
can
draw
benefits
under
the
railroad
retirement
act
and
every
other
activity
that
they
have
as
railroad
man
is
all
geared
to
this
setup
that
they
come
under
these
federal
laws
and
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
no,
that's
true.
i
won't
--
i
won't
dispute
that
but
it
does
follow
that
these
men
are
considered
as
railroad
men.
their
car
toads,
their
switchmen
or
snakes,
their
--
the
whole
lingo,
the
whole
method
of
negotiating
their
agreements,
the
methods
of
handling
their
contracts,
their
working
conditions,
everything
about
these
men
classifies
them
as
railroad
men.
they're
not
under
the
--
the
same
setup
by
any
means
that
other
types
of
employees
are
under
another
industry.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
well,
the
howard
case,
of
course,
went
--
today,
i
would
think
the
court
might
well
decide
it
as
senator
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
as
senator
neely
pointed
--
as
senator
austin
pointed
out,
when
they
were
discussing
the
amending
of
this
act,
he
changed
that
language
to
read
in
anyway
closely,
directly
and
substantially
affecting
because
of
the
language
in
the
jones
&
laughlin
case
that
applied
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
jurisdiction.
and
that
gave
the
scope
and
the
sweep
there
to
the
manufacturer
of
steel
and
the
jurisdiction
extending
to
the
manufacturer
of
steel
so
that
you
could
very
well
from
the
application
of
that
language
on
the
discussion
where
senator
austin
stated
that
very
thing
say
that
the
jurisdiction
here
is
certainly
as
broad
as
it
is
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that's
the
jones
&
laughlin
case
at
301
u.s.
and
he
pointed
out
to
the
judiciary
committee
at
the
time
that
he
had
substituted
the
first
language
in
anyway
and
had
put
in
the
very
language
that's
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that's
where
we
get
this
language
"directly,
closely
and
substantially
affecting
interstate
commerce."
so
that
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
that's
where
it
comes
from.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
that's
right.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
no,
it
isn't
limited.
and
that's
where
this
language
came
from.
senator
austin
precisely
stated
and
it's
in
the
record
in
that
committee
report,
that
he
was
inserting
this
broad
language
in
this
amendment
so
that
it
would
give
precisely
the
same
coverage
that
was
given
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
and
that
is
discussed
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
precisely.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
the
statute
and
that's
where
this
language
comes
from
and
senator
austin
said
that's
where
he
got
it
and
that's
why
he
was
putting
it
in
there,
to
put
in
the
same
language
that
was
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
that's
all
discussed
in
the
ermin
opinion
by
judge
moskowitz,
ermin
against
pennsylvania
railroad,
it's
in
our
briefs
and
judge
moskowitz
goes
into
that
at
some
length
and
discusses
just
how
that
arose
in
giving
a
very
broad
construction
to
the
statute.
judge
moskowitz's
opinion
i
think
is
one
of
the
best
district
court
opinions
that
i
think
should
be
illustrative
and
helpful
to
the
court
in
analyzing
this
because
in
two
well
--
very
well
considered
opinions,
he
went
into
this
matter
at
considerable
length.
so
we
have
men
here
so
far
as
these
carmen's
cases
are
concerned
who
quite
obviously
are
in
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce.
this
man,
according
to
the
record
and
the
testimony
of
the
business
agent
of
their
union
and
the
record
went
into
it
in
considerable
detail,
can
be
transferred
at
any
time
from
one
track
to
another
by
the
management.
the
management
tried
to
say
here,
"well,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
they
didn't
but
they
have
the
right
to."
the
men
themselves
can
insist
upon
their
right
to
be
transferred
from
one
of
these
10
tracks
to
another
in
their
work.
they
all
come
under
the
same
laws,
the
same
practices,
the
same
rules,
the
same
contract
and
to
say
that
these
men
should
be
differentiated
when
they're
working
on
these
different
tracks
is
i'd
say
violating
that
fundamental
and
very
primary
purpose
of
the
amendment
which
mr.
dunne
admits
as
to
--
to
eliminate
the
moment
of
injury
rule.
i'm
not
saying
moment
of
injury
means
just
precise
minute,
i
think
it
means
within
a
week
or
a
month
or
within
a
reasonable
period
where
they're
shifting
back
and
forth
from
one
classification
to
another.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
i
wouldn't
go
so
far,
your
honor,
because
i
would
say
first
we
have
to
look
at
this
language
"furtherance
of
interstate
commerce"
and
then
we
have
to
say
"shall
in
anyway
directly
or
closely
and
substantially
affect
such
commerce"
and
then
we
have
to
say
well,
now,
do
these
men's
duties
and
activities
come
within
that
phrase?
now,
i
can
imagine
that
there
might
be
men
out
running
a
--
working
on
a
canal
that
a
railroad
might
own
or
they
might
be
out
on
some
collateral
activities
in
connection
with
oil
properties,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
the
railroad
might
do.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
well
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
i'm
inclined
to
think
under
the
--
the
interpretation
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
given
to
the
law
that
you
get
pretty
close
to
that.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
here
is
--
here
is
what
i
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
--
think
should
be
the
rule,
your
honor,
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
stated
it
in
that
regard.
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
the
1939
amendment
was
enacted
to
include
injured
employees
previously
excluded,
mr.
dunne
hardly
wants
to
include
anybody
previously
excluded,
and
to
eliminate
confusions
and
hardship,
all
these
carmen
working
on
adjacent
tracks
eliminate
that
kind
of
business,
these
kinds
of
cases
we
have
here,
they're
eliminated
by
that
amendment.
there
are
close
borderline
cases
under
the
old
law
and
now
they
shouldn't
be
close
in
borderline
anymore
under
the
new.
and
to
eliminate
confusions
and
hardship
to
which
they
were
subjected
in
choosing
whether
to
bring
suit
under
state
or
federal
law.
they
are
there
five
years
trying
to
find
out
what
law
they
come
under.
in
order
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
amended
act,
all
doubt
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
its
applicability.
so
i
say
in
these
cases
where
you
got
these
employees
and
these
unions
that
--
that
work
for
these
railroads
and
these
various
classifications
that
in
these
doubtful
cases,
where
there's
an
argument
about
it,
the
california
supreme
court,
i
think,
has
stated
the
right
rule
that
the
presumption
should
be
that
they're
in
interstate
commerce.
take
for
instance
the
question
that
was
asked
by
justice
frankfurter
about
clerks
and
i'm
invading
the
next
case
a
little
bit.
i
think
it
may
answer
your
question
if
i
might,
mr.
justice
harlan.
you
take
a
clerk
out
on
the
railroad
who
is
inspecting
cars
and
taking
down
the
car
number
so
they
could
be
built.
he
is
obviously
under
the
act.
now,
he
sends
his
report
into
a
yard
clerk
who's
in
the
yard
office
right
alongside
the
tracks
and
i
think
that
practically
all
the
cases
would
say
he
was
under
the
act.
and
that
yard
clerk
sends
his
report
over
for
billing
to
a
clerk
over
in
the
main
office
of
the
railroad
where
the
(inaudible)
would
be
at
65
market
street
in
san
francisco,
is
he
to
be
taken
out
of
the
act?
he's
following
right
through
with
the
billing
for
the
interstate
commerce.
it's
in
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce
and
how
can
you
draw
the
line
and
it's
this
next
case
you're
going
to
get
on
the
work
shirt
proposition.
if
the
one
clerk
has
a
work
shirt
and
the
other
has
a
soft
--
a
white
collar,
is
he
going
to
be
in
any
different
classification
than
the
first
fellow?
it
seems
to
me
that
why
you
can't
say
as
to
employees
precisely
just
this
group
of
employees
is
or
isn't
under.
you
can
apply
these
tests
and
give
a
liberal
interpretation
over
this
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
says
and
not
make
a
ridiculous
distinction
such
as
it
was
made
by
judge
yankowitz
in
the
hall
case
out
in
california
that
it
depends
on
whether
he
has
a
white
shirt
or
a
work
shirt.
that
surely
is
no
distinction.
it
depends
on
what
he's
doing
in
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce.
it
depends
upon
his
connection
with
the
overall
activities
of
the
railroad
in
reference
to
these
things
we're
talking
about.
that
was
--
it's
where
i
would
say
to
draw
the
line.
and
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
intelligent
interpretation
but
it
should
be
liberal
and
if
this
court
can
lay
down
the
liberal
rule
to
apply
the
language
of
the
amendment,
we
can
eliminate
a
lot
of
these
borderline
cases.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
with
a
much
a
broader
construction
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
--
and
to
eliminate
--
certainly
to
eliminate
cases
like
these
carmen
who
were
working
on
adjacent
tracks.
that
covers
my
case
and
i
don't
want
to
infringe
too
much
on
my
associate's
time
but
i'll
be
glad
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
well,
the
trouble
with
the
--
the
old
test,
your
honor,
is
limited
right
to
transportation
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
--
just
to
the
lectern
here
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
--
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
goes
far
enough.
it
seems
to
me
the
amendment
broadens
that
in
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce
directly
or
closely
or
substantially
affecting
it
and
gives
us
a
perimeter
out
and
beyond
that
to
include
a
lot
of
these
borderline
cases
like
new
construction
where
they
were
building
new
extensions
to
a
railroad,
new
yards,
where
there
are
various
things
of
that
kind.
for
instance
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
now,
take
--
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
--
take
for
instance
men
who
are
working
on
a
new
line.
i
just
had
a
case
of
--
of
some
men
who
were
working
--
building
a
new
line
on
the
mccloud
river
railroad.
mr.
clifton
hilderbrand
and
the
old
cases
would
have
held
they
didn't
come
under
the
act.
but
here,
you
have
freightmen
out
on
work
trains,
you
have
the
section
gangs
that
do
the
same
kind
of
work
that
their
fellows
do,
they're
all
born
with
the
same
union,
they're
all
in
the
same
setup,
they're
under
the
railway
labor
act,
railroad
retirement
act
and
all
these
things.
it
seems
to
me
the
broad
sweep
of
the
--
of
the
new
amendment
would
include
all
of
these
kind
of
former
borderline
cases
that
the
courts
were
struggling
with
formerly
and
saying,
“well,
we
can't
include
new
construction
because
it
isn't
right
in
this
lectern
here
of
the
transportation
field.
and
i
--
i
think
that
those
old
cases
were
swept
out
the
window
by
the
1939
amendment
that
certainly
the
1939
amendment
means
something.
it
doesn't
just
mean
that
--
that
congress
was
reaffirming
this
old
line
of
cases
that
mr.
dunne
has
quoted
to
the
court.
it
means
that
as
a
broader
conception
and
that
these
men
shouldn't
have
such
difficulty
in
determining
where
they're
to
go
and
what
their
rights
are
and
--
and
the
language
is
pretty
fraud
that
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce,
i
think,
means
what
it
says.
i
don't
believe
congress
was
idle
in
its
use
of
the
term
or
that
it
intended
merely
to
limit
it
to
the
old
conception
or
why
should
they
have
passed
the
amendment.
it
was
to
eliminate
all
that,
just
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
to
include
injured
employees
previously
excluded
and
eliminate
confusions
and
hardship.
now,
these
are
the
kind
of
cases
that
bring
about
the
confusion
and
hardship
and
doubt
where
you
got
men
working
in
the
same
union
under
the
same
contracts,
the
same
seniority
setup,
interchangeable
when
their
duties
might
be
working
one
month
over
on
this
new
construction,
the
next
month
the
other
place
or
one
year
one
place,
the
other
year
the
other
back
and
forth
thereon,
those
all
should
they
all
be
in
the
same
classification,
otherwise
how
can
you
properly
advise
them
or
can
they
properly
be
represented
and
where
--
how
do
they
know
where
they're
going
to
wind
up.
it
seems
to
me
this
court
should
lay
down
some
rule
that
congress
meant
what
it
said
and
it
said
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce
on
a
really
broad
basis.
