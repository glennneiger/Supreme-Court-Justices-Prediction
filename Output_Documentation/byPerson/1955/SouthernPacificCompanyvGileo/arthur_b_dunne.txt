mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
if
your
honor
please.
i
learned
yesterday
at
my
arrival
here
that
the
court
had
enlarged
the
time
of
the
respondents
to
an
hour
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i
have
the
burden
of
stating
the
five
cases.
i'm
hopeful
that
i
maybe
indulged
a
little
beyond
the
half
hour
that
was
allotted.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
thank
you,
your
honor.
now,
this
is
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
which
brings
to
this
court
for
review
five
cases
decided
in
that
court,
all
involving
and
turning
upon
substantially
the
same
question.
each
case
was
an
action
by
an
employee
against
his
employer.
the
employer
as
to
part
of
its
business
was
a
common
carrier
by
a
railroad
and
as
to
a
part
of
that
business
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
it
was
sought
to
sustain
these
actions
for
damages
for
personal
injuries
received
on
the
job
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
as
amended
in
1939.
if
that
act
did
not
apply,
then
under
california
law,
the
sole
remedy
of
these
employees
was
under
the
compensation
provisions
of
the
california
labor
code
and
the
soul
body
having
jurisdiction
to
determine
their
benefits
was
the
california
industrial
accident
commission.
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
that
commission
could
be
ousted
only
if
this
federal
statute
applied
and
if
it
did
not,
the
lower
courts
are
without
jurisdiction.
in
the
gileo
case,
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
was
reserved
until
the
time
of
trial
and
was
determined
by
the
trial
court
as
a
matter
of
law
in
favor
of
its
jurisdiction.
the
plaintiff
had
a
judgment
upon
the
verdict
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
after
an
intermediate
court
of
appeal,
the
district
court
of
appeal
had
determined
the
case
should
be
reversed.
in
the
other
four
cases,
which
were
pending
in
sacramento,
the
jurisdictional
question
was
separately
tried
to
the
court
sitting
without
a
jury.
in
two
of
the
cases,
the
court
determined
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
and
upon
that
face
--
that
face
of
the
trial,
entered
judgment
for
the
defendant.
those
judgements
were
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
in
the
other
two
cases,
the
question
was
likewise
separately
determined
and
the
trial
court
determined
in
favor
of
its
jurisdiction.
in
both
cases
there
was
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
in
one
of
them,
the
judgment
was
added
on
the
verdict
and
was
affirmed.
in
the
other
on
motion
for
a
judgment
non
obstante
veredicto,
the
court
entered
judgment
for
the
defendant
but
not
on
the
jurisdictional
point
upon
the
ground
that
no
negligence
had
been
shown.
that
judgment
was
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
california.
so
that
in
all
five
cases,
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
determined
that
the
trial
courts
had
jurisdiction
and
that
judgments
should
--
for
the
plaintiff
should
be
affirmed
where
they
had
judgments
and
in
the
other
two
cases,
the
cases
should
go
back
for
trial
upon
the
question
of
negligence
and
damages.
the
question
that
is
presented
here
then
is
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
section
1
of
that
act
which
is
set
out
at
pages
5
and
6
of
our
brief.
you
will
notice
that
the
statute
is
in
two
paragraphs.
the
critical
words
in
the
first
paragraph
are
that
the
statute
shall
apply
to
every
common
carrier
by
railroad
while
engaging
in
commerce
between
the
states
and
so
forth,
and
that
such
described
employer
shall
be
liable
to
any
person
suffering
injury
while
he
is
employed
by
such
carrier
in
such
commerce.
that
language
comes
from
the
act
of
1908
and
when
the
statute
was
amended
in
1939,
that
language
was
reenacted.
there
is
a
second
paragraph
of
the
statute
and
upon
the
other
side
it
is
claimed
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
the
critical
language
there
was
the
controlling
language
and
the
provision
there
is
that
any
employee
of
a
carrier,
any
part
of
whose
duties
as
such
employee
shall
be
the
furtherance
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
shall,
in
anyway
directly
or
closely
and
substantially,
affect
such
commerce
shall
be
for
the
purposes
of
the
act
considered
as
having
been
employed
in
interstate
commerce.
i
later
shall
want
to
comment
on
the
history
of
that
language
in
this
amendment,
how
that
language
got
in
there
and
of
course
of
the
enactment.
i
suggest
first
that
this
statute
as
it
now
reads
poses
two
questions,
does
the
employer
fit
the
description
of
the
statute?
and
secondly,
does
the
employee
fit
the
description
of
the
statute?
and
that
cases
under
the
statute
cannot
be
determined
as
the
supreme
court
of
california
undertook
to
determine
them
by
looking
solely
at
the
language
that
describes
the
employees
who
are
brought
under
the
statute.
before
going
to
that,
i
should
now
state
in
more
detail
for
your
honors
the
facts
of
these
five
cases.
the
southern
pacific
company,
as
i
stated,
is
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
engaged
in
interstate
and
intrastate
commerce,
at
least
as
to
some
of
its
activities.
at
sacramento,
california,
it
has
a
general
shop,
said
to
be
the
largest
general
railroad
shops
west
of
chicago.
those
general
shops
in
the
organization
of
the
railroad
are
separate
from
the
operating
division
that
includes
the
city
of
sacramento.
divisions
usually
have
their
own
division
shops.
this
shop,
however,
is
a
general
shop,
although
it
does
because
it
has
the
facilities,
do
some
of
the
work
for
the
sacramento
division.
there
is,
however,
a
separate
organization
and
a
separate
chain
of
command
in
that
shop
going
directly
to
the
executive
officers
in
san
francisco
and
not
going
through
the
superintendent
of
the
sacramento
division,
the
operating
division.
as
a
part
of
that
shop
for
some
40
to
50
years,
southern
pacific
company
has
operated
a
wheel
foundry
where
it
makes
cast
iron
freight
car
wheels.
it
does
that
in
the
usual
way
that
all
wheel
manufacturers
make
their
wheels.
it
uses,
has
the
basic
material,
97%
of
the
material,
scrapped
wheels,
outside
wheel
foundries
do
exactly
the
same
thing
and
indeed
require
the
exchange
of
an
old
wheel
when
a
new
wheel
is
purchased.
the
operation
is
a
large
operation.
in
1950,
the
wheel
foundry
produced
over
67,000
wheels
and
in
1951
of
over
65,000
wheels,
a
very
few
of
them,
10
in
one
year,
16
in
another
are
supplied
to
outside
people.
some
small
number
about
700
or
800
go
to
a
subsidiary
northwestern
pacific
railroad
and
the
rest
of
them
are
used
by
southern
pacific
company
in
replacements
on
its
own
cars
and
on
foreign
cars
which
require
new
wheels
while
on
southern
pacific
lines.
the
wheel
foundry
provides
about
84%
of
the
requirements
of
southern
pacific
company.
the
remaining
16%
are
purchased
from
outside
wheel
manufacturers.
aranda,
for
11
years,
had
been
a
molder's
helper
and
a
molder
in
the
wheel
foundry.
he
did
no
other
work.
he
was
injured
in
the
foundry
while
he
was
doing
that
work.
the
answer
sets
out
and
the
jury's
verdict
found
that
he
had
been
paid
compensation
under
the
state
act,
the
extent
of
$1448.57.
it
returned
a
verdict
for
$12,000,
deducted
that
amount
and
judgment
presented
for
the
balance.
in
that
same
general
shop
at
sacramento,
southern
pacific
company
has
a
freight
carshop,
known
as
carshop
no.9.
that
shop
up
until
the
1st
of
july
of
1950
was
engaged
in
general
repair
work,
light
and
heavy
repair
work.
on
the
1st
of
january
of
1950,
that
shop
undertook
a
program
of
construction
of
new
cars,
wholly
new
manufacture
of
freight
cars.
in
the
latter
part
of
1950,
the
southern
pacific
company
determined
to
build
5000
units
of
freight
train
cars.
a
little
over
2000
for
itself
and
some
2000
odd
for
a
subsidiary,
texas
and
new
orleans
railroad
company,
the
t&no.
that
matter
was
submitted
to
southern
pacific
equipment
company,
a
subsidiary
of
southern
pacific
company
and
it
entered
into
a
contract
for
the
construction
of
those
cars
and
for
the
sale
of
them
to
a
financing
institution
and
then
for
financing
under
an
equipment
trust
and
lease
back
to
southern
pacific
company
with
a
privilege
of
sublease
to
t&no.
southern
pacific
equipment
company,
in
turn,
entered
into
a
contract
on
the
cost-plus
basis
with
southern
pacific
company
for
the
use
of
the
facilities
in
the
sacramento
shop,
for
the
shop
facilities
and
machinery
and
for
the
supplying
of
laborer.
that
program
progressed
with
some
1500
automobile
cars
up
to
january
of
1951.
there
was
a
break
when
they
ran
out
of
material
and
the
program
went
on
again
with
part
of
that
1500
automobile
cars
on
the
13th
of
february
and
continued
then
on
progressively.
the
next
program
after
that
was
1000
gondola
cars,
gons
as
the
railroad
men
call
them,
which
moves
the
t&no
and
then
some
other
cars.
up
to
the
time
that
the
gileo
case
was
tried
there
had
been
manufactured
in
that
shop
5400
new
freight
train
cars.
gileo,
eufrazia
and
eelk
were
all
injured
while
working
in
the
construction
of
the
program
for
1000
tn&o
gons.
the
way
the
system
worked
was
that
they
used
tracks
on
a
regular
assembly
line
basis.
the
materials
were
placed
at
various
stages.
at
the
beginning
of
the
assembly
line,
they
started
with
the
trucks
and
then
as
the
car
moved
on,
additional
parts
were
put
on.
the
assembly
line
produced
18
cars
a
day.
the
work
at
each
station
took
about
25
minutes
and
then
the
whole
line
moved
on
one
station.
the
setup
was
such
that
if
a
single
man
were
absent
from
the
assembly
line,
the
whole
assembly
line
stopped.
the
absence
of
one
of
four
members
of
a
riveting
gang
would
prevent
that
riveting
gang
from
operating
on
the
end
of
a
car
and
if
that
end
of
a
car
couldn't
be
finished,
that
car
couldn't
move
and
the
rest
of
the
line
couldn't
move.
for
the
purpose
of
providing
a
labor
force
for
this
work,
when
the
work
of
new
construction
was
instituted,
the
southern
pacific
company
employed
a
new
force
of
men,
substantially
300
men.
now,
since
something
is
made
of
it,
i
should
state
to
your
honors
the
method
of
assigning
them
to
work
there.
these
men
belong
to
a
brotherhood
and
they're
all
classified
as
carmen.
no
matter
whether
they're
working
in
wood
or
in
steel,
whatever
the
work
is
they
are
all
carmen
or
carmen's
helpers
or
apprentices.in
the
program
for
these
tn&o
cars,
there
was
something
over
350
i
think
the
figure
is.
carmen
and
carmen's
helpers
were
employed
on
this
particular
program
of
--
in
the
yard
i
should
say,
in
the
shop
of
those,
some
270
or
about
74%
percent
were
employed
on
new
car
construction.
these
men
were
organized
into
separate
division
and
the
head
of
the
shop
was
the
general
foreman.
under
him
were
two
assistant,
a
general
foreman,
one
in
charge
of
the
repair
work
on
cars
in
service
and
the
other
in
charge
of
the
work
of
new
construction.
then
under
him
were
set
up
these
gangs.
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
absenteeism
among
the
men
who
are
assigned
to
the
new
car
construction
work,
which
was
the
number
one
program
of
the
shop.
accordingly
in
order
that
the
work
would
not
be
stopped
because
of
this
absenteeism,
carmen
and
carmen's
helpers
regularly
assigned
in
the
repair
division
would
be
brought
over
for
the
division
for
a
new
car
construction
on
a
temporary
basis.
one
man
who
testified
came
over
a
half
a
day
and
then
went
back
to
his
work
on
repair,
but
the
men
who
are
assigned
to
new
car
construction
were
not
temporarily
taken
off
that
job
for
the
purpose
of
doing
repair
work.
the
men
were
entitled
on
the
basis
of
seniority
to
bid
and
they
could
bid
into
carshop
no.9
or
they
could
bid
into
the
sawmill
or
into
the
passenger
carshop
or
into
the
local
motor
shop
where
a
certain
work
was
done
on
minor
parts,
but
that
was
the
only
election
they
had
in
the
selection
of
their
jobs.
once
a
man
bid
into
carshop
no.9,
what
work
he
should
do
then
was
a
matter
of
assignment
by
the
general
foreman
and
the
general
foreman
could
assign
him
to
new
car
construction
or
he
could
assign
him
to
repair
work.
and
as
i
have
suggested
already
to
your
honors,
when
the
men
were
assigned
to
new
car
construction,
they
stayed
on
new
car
construction
until
the
foreman
changed
that
assignment.
in
1951,
the
southern
pacific
determined
to
build
a
new
yard
known
as
a
retarder
yard
for
the
classification
of
cars.
at
a
point
slightly
east
of
sacramento,
california
near
roosevelt,
california,
which
is
the
point
at
the
base
of
the
sierras,
where
there
was
a
large
train
yard
on
the
main
line
over
the
sierras
and
east
to
ogden,
and
where
also
lines
coming
down
into
california
from
oregon
converged
with
that
line
and
converged
with
lines
coming
up
from
the
southern
part
of
california
through
the
san
joaquin
valley.
it
was
the
point
of
classification
for
freight
cars
and
the
making
up
of
the
freight
trains
designed
for
the
main
transcontinental
journey
eastbound
and
the
point
at
which
westbound
freight
trains
were
broken
up
for
purposes
of
distribution.
at
roseville,
there
had
been
to
the
east
of
a
vacant
space,
two
yards
known
as
the
west
yard
and
the
east
yard.
some
distance
to
the
west
of
that,
there
were
two
other
freight
train
yards,
the
antelope
yard
and
the
high
line
yard.
and
in
between
the
two
yards
to
the
east
and
the
two
yards
to
the
west
in
this
open
country
there
was
--
there
were
four
tracks,
two
main
line
tracks
and
two
grill
tracks.
southern
pacific
company
determined
to
put
in
to
that
vacant
space
a
retarder
yard
for
the
purpose
of
speeding
up
classification
in
the
handling
of
cars.
for
that
purpose
--
project
was
a
large
one,
running
something
over
a
million
dollars.
for
that
purpose,
it
acquired
some
80
acres
of
additional
land.
it
removed
two
county
roads,
it
removed
two
power
lines,
it
removed
a
telephone
line
and
a
telegraph
line.
it
removed
its
own
two
drill
tracks
and
it
built
two
main
line
tracks
for
passenger
service
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
north.
then
in
this
area,
had
brought
in
an
outside
contractor
morrison-knudsen,
moved
about
300,000
yards
of
earth
for
purposes
of
grading,
brought
the
grade
to
about
three
feet
above
the
grade
of
the
old
main
line
and
then
undertook
the
installation
of
this
retarder
or
hump
yard.
a
hump
yard
is
a
yard
which
is
built,
as
the
name
suggest,
with
a
hump
at
one
end.
and
the
cars
are
shoved
up
to
the
top
of
that
hump
on
two
tracks
and
then
from
then
on
the
grade
in
that
direction
is
downhill.
at
the
point
of
entry
to
the
yard,
there
are
built
inspection
pits
and
(inaudible)
then
beyond
that,
tracks
fan
out.
in
this
instance,
49
yard
tracks,
30
miles
of
track,
98
switches
and
12
retarders.
in
addition,
the
--
the
project
called
to
the
installation
of
three
compressors
for
compressed
air
to
operate
the
retarders,
four
towers
for
providing
floodlighting
and
control
and
the
other
facilities
such
as
talking
systems,
loud
speaker,
radio
and
so
forth.
that
project
was
started
in
april
of
1951.
by
the
1st
of
october
of
1951,
the
construction
of
the
new
main
line
to
the
north
had
progressed
to
the
point
where
trains
could
run
over
it
at
a
restricted
speed.
it
was
in
full
operation
by
november
of
1951.
on
the
second
of
october,
moreno
was
employed.
he
was
working
as
a
laborer
in
taking
out
the
old
main
line
and
doing
other
work
in
the
construction
of
this
new
classification
or
retarder
yard.
he
was
injured
in
december
of
1951.
up
to
that
point,
work
on
the
antelope
and
high
line
yards
to
the
west
had
been
completed.
there
were
some
changes
that
were
to
be
made
there
and
they
were
being
used
as
receiving
yards
but
there
was
no
track
connection
with
the
new
retarder
aspect
of
the
total
installation.
the
first
revenue
trains
to
go
into
the
retarder
yard
itself
was
on
the
1st
of
april
1952,
when
the
first
21
tracks
in
that
yard
had
been
completed
and
put
into
operation.
the
short
of
the
matter
is
aranda
wasn't
a
railroad
man,
he
was
making
wheels.
gileo,
eufrazia
and
eelk
were
employed
in
the
construction
of
new
cars.moreno
was
employed
in
the
construction
of
a
wholly
new
retarder
yard.
none
of
the
work
that
any
of
these
men
was
doing
could
be
classified
as
work
of
maintenance
or
repair
of
a
facility
in
use
by
a
railroad
or
in
interstate
commerce.
none
of
these
men
would
have
fallen
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
of
1908.
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
crystal
clear
on
that.
the
question
posed
is,
has
that
situation
been
changed
for
a
man
so
employed
by
such
an
employer
by
a
reason
of
the
amendment
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
1939?
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
they
do
not
concede
it
in
terms,
your
honor,
but
they
do
not
question
it.
my
opponents
in
this
case
would
be
very
happy
to
forget
the
some
30
years
of
history
of
the
act
of
1908
and
the
course
of
adjudication
under
that
act
in
many,
many
cases
and
at
least
40
to
50
cases
which
have
had
the
attention
of
this
court,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
amendment
of
1939
cannot
be
understood
by
forgetting
that
30
years
or
more
of
history.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
only
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
no
constitutional
questions
involved,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
now,
the
most
striking
feature
aside
from
the
addition
of
language
in
the
amendment
of
1939
is
that
the
section
of
the
act,
to
which
the
second
paragraph
was
added,
was
reenacted
word
for
word
as
it
had
been
enacted
in
1908
and
is
--
it
had
read
while
this
court
had
considered
as
a
matter
of
its
application
in
some
40
to
50
cases.
and
that
history
i
suggest
to
your
honors
is
not
only
interesting
but
very
illuminating
and
it
goes
back.
in
the
late
90's,
congress
of
the
united
states
turned
its
attention
to
the
injury
of
railroad
workers
and
it
started
the
enactment
of
a
series
of
statutes
commonly
known
as
the
safety
acts.
in
1907
for
the
same
purpose,
it
added
the
ash
pan
act.
and
in
1911
and
1915,
for
the
same
purpose,
it
added
provisions
of
the
boiler
inspection
act.
all
directed
at
the
matter
of
safety
and
all
dealing
with
the
condition
of
rolling
equipment
whether
it
be
power
or
cars
in
use
upon
the
line.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
they're
rather
confined
application
of
those
various
statutes
and
there's
part
of
this
mosaic.
in
1906,
the
congress
enacted
the
first
employers'
liability
act
which
was
to
apply
to
all
common
carriers
engaged
in
commerce
and
was
to
apply,
that
is
interstate
commerce
and
it
said
trade
and
commerce,
and
it
applied
to
all
of
the
employees
of
such
employers.
in
january
of
1908,
in
the
howard
case,
the
first
employers'
liability
act
case,
this
court
held
that
statute
be
on
the
competence
of
congress
as
this
court
construed
the
statute
and
it
construed
that
that's
applying
to
all
employees
of
such
carriers.
mr.
justice
holmes
and
two
other
members
of
the
court
dissented
and
mr.
justice
holmes
in
his
dissent
suggested
that
the
statute
could
be
saved
by
construing
it
to
apply
when
engaged
or
while
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
i
suggest
that
because
congress
followed
that
suggestion.
promptly
in
april
of
1908,
congress
adopted
the
present
statute
which
has
been
amended
several
times
but
in
no
respects
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
except
in
1939.
and
it
designedly
put
in
mark
restrictions
on
the
application
of
the
act.
it
was
now
to
employ
--
apply
only
to
railroads,
common
carriers
which
were
railroads.
secondly,
it
was
to
apply
them
only
while
engaging
in
commerce.
congress
dropped
the
word
"trade."
and
thirdly,
it
was
not
to
apply
to
all
employees
but
it
was
to
apply
to
the
employees
only
while
employed
by
such
carrier
in
such
commerce.
this
court
in
a
series
of
decisions,
thereafter,
recognized
that
this
statute
was
part
of
this
pattern
of
the
safety
acts
aimed
primarily
if
not
exclusively,
not
exclusively
but
aimed
primarily
at
the
hazards
that
were
peculiar
to
railroad.
and
this
court
said
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
these
statutes
are
all
in
pari
materia
and
indeed
in
urie
against
thompson
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
these
various
safety
statutes
while
not
in
form,
in
substance
were
amendments
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
designed
to
assist
the
employees
in
recovery
when
they
had
been
injured.
now,
in
the
course
of
adjudication,
this
court
gave
meticulous
attention
to
the
restrictive
wording
that
congress
had
written
into
the
act
of
1908.
it
held
in
the
first
place
that
this
very
petitioner,
southern
pacific
company,
although
a
common
carrier
by
a
railroad
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
did
not
fall
within
the
act
when
it
was
operating
an
offshore
vessel,
the
famous
case
of
southern
pacific
company
against
jensen.
one
of
the
two
points
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
the
competency
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
award
compensation
was
removed
by
reason
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
the
court
held
no,
the
act
did
not
apply.
and
that
has
been
followed
down
at
least
as
to
maritime
employment
by
this
court
in
nogueira
case
in
281
and
very
recently
in
the
o'rourke
case
in
344
u.s.
secondly,
it
gave
meticulous
attention
to
the
words
of
the
statute
that
it
applied
when
the
employee
was
engaged
in
an
interstate
commerce
and
in
an
early
case
in
233,
the
behrens
case,
this
court
held
that
to
give
effect
to
that
language
you
must
to
look
to
the
precise
work
that
the
injured
man
was
doing
at
the
very
time
he
was
injured
and
it
resulted
from
that
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
carr
case
and
in
the
nogueira
case
that
a
man
might
move
in
under
the
act
and
move
out
again
several
times
during
the
course
of
a
single
tour
of
duty.
that
would
be
peculiarly
so
in
the
case
of
switchmen.
and
then
finally,
this
court
came
to
the
question
of
what
is
interstate
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
this
act
and
by
a
very
slow
and
careful
process,
it
evolved
a
test
under
the
act
of
1908.
it
said
itself
that
in
1920
it
had
departed
from
that
test
and
in
1931
and
1932
in
three
cases
in
284,
this
court
overruled
its
own
decisions
of
1920.
and
what
it
did
was
this.
in
the
first
step,
the
pedersen
case
in
1913,
it
had
before
it
the
language
and
some
rather
restrictive
language
from
the
howard
case,
it
looked
at
the
work
of
a
man
who
was
repairing,
doing
work
in
repairing
a
bridge,
it
was
part
of
the
highway
of
commerce,
it
said
no
of
course
that's
not
transportation
but
it's
pretty
close
to
it
and
it's
so
close
to
it
that
it
really
is
a
part
of
it,
we'll
apply
the
act
to
him.but
presently,
there
came
along
the
shanks
case
in
239
where
a
man
was
removing
a
countershaft
in
a
repair
shop
and
the
court
reexamined
the
question
then
and
it
said
we
have
to
determine
this
question
not
by
any
conception
involved
in
vacuo
or
in
other
circumstances.
well,
we've
got
to
look
at
the
business
that
this
statute
was
dealing
with,
we've
got
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
railroad
business
and
we
have
to
apply
a
practical
test
that
is
better
suited
to
the
occasion
than
some
concept
involved
elsewhere.
and
it
said
when
we
look
at
the
nature
of
the
business
of
railroad
and
we
find
that
its
transportation,
so
that
congress
in
this
act
when
it
was
talking
about
commerce,
was
talking
about
transportation
and
therefore
what
falls
under
the
act
is
transportation
or
work
so
closely
related
to
the
actual
transportation,
has
to
be
practically
a
part
of
it.
and
shortly
thereafter
in
the
davis
case
which
is
reported
in
254,
the
court
examined
and
stated
the
rationale
of
that
doctrine
and
it
said
obviously
everybody
who
is
employed
by
a
railroad
is
important
in
its
business.
perhaps,
the
business
couldn't
go
on
without
the
presence
of
this
particular
employee
but
the
act
doesn't
cover
all
the
employees
of
the
railroad,
it
was
unlike
the
act
of
1906
in
that
respect.
and
so,
we
have
to
narrow
down
and
narrow
down
and
narrow
down
until
we
come
to
those
activities
which
are
close
to
the
heart
of
the
business
being
dealt
with
railroading
and
transportation
and
exactly
that
same
process
was
going
through
again
in
1931.
when
this
court
reexamined,
carefully
reexamined
the
whole
question
restated
the
rationale
of
the
davis
case
and
overruled
the
collins
and
schware
cases.
now,
it
resulted
from
this
process
of
adjudication
that
the
moment
of
injury
rule
had
developed.
a
man
would
be
in
the
rule
one
minute,
under
the
act
one
minute
and
then
when
he
finished
with
an
interstate
car
and
was
handling
an
intrastate
car
and
switching,
he
was
out
of
the
act.
and
then
his
next
assignment
after
that
would
be
back
in
the
act
and
that
had
produced
borderline
cases
and
it
was
felt
that
that
had
produced
considerable
hardship.
there
was
another
type
of
case
which
was
somewhat
outstanding
and
the
davis
case
itself
was
one.he
was
at
local
motor
dedicated
generally
to
interstate
commerce
but
it
had
to
be
repaired
and
so
it
was
taken
to
the
back
shop
and
in
that
sense
was
withdrawn
from
service.
it
fall
within
the
act
but
it
didn't,
was
it
like
the
bridge
which
is
permanently
dedicated
or
was
it
something
that
had
temporary
character.
the
decision
of
this
court
was
that
it
had
a
temporary
character
in
this
sense
that
it
was
withdrawn
from
service.
a
man
doing
work
of
heavy
repair
on
local
motors
and
other
equipment
withdrawn
from
service
did
not
fall
under
the
act.
and
then
there
was
the
close
problem
presented
by
this
court's
own
decisions
in
collins
against
schware.
now,
those
were
men
who
engaged
in
accessorial
services
not
directly
connected
with
interstate
commerce.
those
were
men
--
one
man
was
operating
pumping
water
to
be
supplied
to
local
motors
and
the
other
man
was
drying
sand
to
be
used
in
local
motors.
now,
that
in
short
and
in
summary,
the
detail
is
considerably
more
than
this.
that
was
the
background
of
the
act
of
1939
and
congress
in
1939
wanted
to
do
what
it
could
to
clarify
these
borderline
cases
and
to
remove
this
moment
of
injury
rule
where
a
switchman
who
was
injured
would
have
his
remedy
under
this
act
or
under
a
state
act
on
the
luck
of
the
draw.
there
is
one
other
consideration
i
think
that
this
court
must
have
before
it
in
considering
the
--
what
congress
did
in
1939
and
that
is
this.
in
1908,
when
the
first
federal
employers'
liability
act
was
enacted,
there
were
no
state
compensation
acts.
in
1939,
every
state
had
some
form
of
compensation
act
or
other
legislation
for
a
workman
generally
with
the
exception
of
two
and
taking
as
an
example
my
own
state
of
california,
we
not
only
had
a
compensation
act
there
that
was
comprehensive
but
in
addition
had
enacted
some
safety
statutes
and
had
given
to
a
local
commission
the
power
to
enact
safety
rules
and
that
commission
had
enacted
a
code
to
safety
rules
of
something
over
1300
pages.
none
of
which
will
apply
to
men
who
are
under
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
which
cover
fields
of
safety
regulation
far
beyond
the
confined
field
to
which
the
said
federal
safety
acts
and
boiler
inspection
act
applied.
in
other
words,
the
farther
the
application
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
is
extended,
the
greater
will
be
the
area
in
which
the
man
will
have
no
safety
regulations.
now,
in
such
circumstances,
congress
did
not
take
--
undertake
a
revamping
of
the
whole
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
we
have
in
a
very
illuminating
doctrine,
a
document
upon
which
--
upon
what
congress
wanted
to
do.
amendments
had
been
introduced
in
the
house
and
in
the
senate.
in
the
senate
alone
was
there
introduced
an
amendment
which
would
affect
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
amendments
in
the
house
had
to
do
with
features
of
the
act
with
which
we're
not
concerned.
and
the
senate
committee
in
reporting
the
act
to
the
senate
wrote
a
fairly
lengthy
report
in
which
it
stated
what
had
been
done
and
what
was
intended.
and
from
that
and
from
the
hearings,
the
following
emerges,
if
i
may
call
the
court's
attention
now
to
precise
language
of
the
act,
the
opening
part
of
the
second
paragraph.
that
amendment
as
originally
proposed
would
have
read
this
way
that
any
employee
of
a
carrier,
any
part
of
whose
duties
as
such
employee
shall
be
the
furtherance
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
or
shall,
in
anyway,
affect
such
commerce.
you
will
notice
i
have
left
out
some
words.
in
the
course
of
enactment
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
i
am
reading
from
page
6,
your
honor,
the
second
paragraph
of
the
quoted
statute.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
of
my
brief,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
page
6,
if
your
honor
please.
you
may
have
the
petition
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
yes,
sir.
so
that
there
was
a
skip
from
--
in
the
third
line
there,
"or
shall
in
any
way,"
down
to
affect.
in
the
course
of
amendment,
there
was
inserted
these
words
in
any
--
so
that
it
read,
"in
any
way
directly
or
closely
and
substantially."
i
suggest
that
it
can
be
the
only
one
inference,
those
words
were
inserted
to
restrict
the
application
of
the
act.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
they
had,
your
honor,
and
had
been
commented
on
--
there's
some
comment
on
those
words
at
some
length
from
the
santa
cruz
case.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
well,
they
--
they
did,
that
was
the
word
they
emphasized
in
particular.
and
if
i
have
time,
i
--
i
would
like
to
comment
on
the
relationship
of
these
two
clauses
to
each
other.
now,
the
second
thing
that
was
done
was
that
as
originally
proposed
in
the
senate
and
as
appears
from
the
senate
report,
it
was
suggested
that
the
coverage
as
to
employers
should
be
enlarged
by
including
express
companies,
freight
forwarders
and
sleeping-car
companies.
they
had
been
held
not
to
be
under
the
act
of
1908
since
it
applied
only
to
railroads.
that
suggestion
was
rejected
by
the
committee
upon
the
ground
that
there
was
no
need
for
the
inclusion
of
express
companies,
freight
forwarders
and
sleeping-car
companies,
although
their
men
were
intimately
connected
with
at
least
some
traces
of
railroad
operation.
and
i
infer
that
there
was
no
necessity
because
by
1939
those
men
were
adequately
taken
care
of
under
state
compensation
statutes.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
a
--
a
senate
report
which
is
credited
in
full
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that
is
in
full
so
far
as
it
involves
this
particular
amendment.
there
were
others.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
yes.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
now,
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
some
things
are
noteworthy
and
the
negative
in
this
instance
is
as
noteworthy
as
deposited.
the
negative
is
that
congress
did
not
tamper
with
the
definition
of
employer
in
the
1908
act
but
deliberately
and
expressly
refrained
from
tampering
with
that
definition.
secondly,
we
don't
have
to
guess
as
to
whether
congress
was
aware
of
the
course
of
decision
in
this
court
as
to
the
meaning
of
interstate
commerce
because
the
hearings
and
the
report
show
that
congress
was
familiar
at
least
with
the
shanks
case.
and
indeed
in
the
overstreet
case,
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
this
court
commented
on
the
fact
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
test
to
the
shanks
case.
we
have
then
and
this
court
again
has
commented
on
this
fairly
recently
in
the
desper
case
which
was
an
action
under
the
jones
act
that
the
only
thing
that
congress
did
was
redefine
employees
for
the
purposes
of
this
act.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that's
true.
now,
mr.
justice
douglas
commented
on
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
picked
out
and
set
its
attention
on
the
furtherance
phrase.
i
suggest
that
one
of
the
matters
for
consideration
of
this
court
is
the
relationship
of
the
"furtherance"
phrase
to
the
“directly
or
closely
and
substantially”
phrase.
in
some
context
and
in
some
places,
i
suppose
that
the
word
"furtherance"
could
mean
anything
proximate
or
remote
which
would
assist
or
forward
a
given
result.
and
in
that
respect,
i
suppose
in
another
context
and
dealing
with
another
problem,
the
use
of
the
word
"furtherance"
as
in
a
statute
dealing
with
an
employer
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
might
very
well
comprehend
all
of
its
employees.
and
i
think
the
history
of
the
statute,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
senate
report,
will
indicate
that
clearly
it
was
not
intended
that
all
employees
of
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
which
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
should
be
brought
in
this
act.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
there
are,
your
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
there
are,
your
honor.
and
i
could
discuss
those
cases
but
i
should
be
arguing
the
next
case
if
i
did
that.
that
matter
is
presented
in
the
reed
case
which
immediately
follows.
so
if
i
may
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
what?
i
am
not
in
that
case,
your
honor.
so
if
i
may,
i
prefer
to
leave
the
argument
of
that
matter
to
counsel
in
that
case.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
now,
the
second
thing
about
this
matter
of
furtherance
is
this.if
furtherance
is
to
be
given
a
latitudinarian
construction
then
what
earthly
use
is
served
by
the
succeeding
clause,
"directly
or
closely
and
substantially?"
if
furtherance
is
to
be
given
the
all
embracive
sweep
that
apparently
the
supreme
court
of
california
thought
should
be
given
to
it
then
congress
was
indulging
in
useless
repetition
in
adding
the
words,
"directly
and
closely
and
substantially,"
and
words
which
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
pointed
out
had
received
notice
in
opinions
of
this
court.
and
not
only
in
the
opinions
that
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
in
mind
but
in
opinions
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
as
that
act
had
been
construed
and
applied
by
this
court
prior
to
the
time
that
it
was
amended
in
1939.
for
instance,
in
the
harrington
case
which
was
a
case
of
stockpiling
coal
and
the
switchman
was
taking
a
car
or
cut
of
cars
to
place
where
the
coal
was
to
be
stored.
it
was
said
that
the
work
there
was
not
directly
related
to
interstate
commerce.
those
cases,
if
the
court
please,
you
will
find
cited
throughout
our
brief
and
we
have
discussed
and
endeavored
to
classify
these
various
cases.
and
out
of
them,
dealing
with
this
type
of
language,
come
these
cases
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
and
i
am
again
suggesting
that
we
have
a
double
test.
is
the
employer
the
type
of
employer
that's
described
by
the
act?
as
well
as
the
test,
is
the
employee
the
type
described
by
the
act?
pedersen
case,
the
first
case
holding
that
repair
of
a
bridge
fell
under
the
act,
by
a
way
of
distinction,
pointed
out
the
construction
of
cars
would
not.
in
the
raymond,
it
was
held
that
the
driving
of
a
tunnel
for
the
purpose
of
shortening
the
line
did
not
fall
under
the
act.
in
white,
there
was
a
construction
of
a
new
station
and
new
tracks,
the
act
did
not
apply.
in
nash,
a
memorandum
of
opinion
reversing
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
and
a
construction
of
a
new
outhouse
did
not
fall
within
the
act.
in
yurkonis,
mining
of
coal
to
supply
local
motors
hauling
interstate
trains
was
not
under
the
act.
in
harrington
and
barlow,
handling
cars
carrying
coal
for
use
in
such
local
motors,
where
the
coal
was
to
be
stockpiled
for
later
use,
did
not
fall
under
the
act.
i
suggest
for
the
court's
consideration
three
other
cases
which
were
not
f.e.l.a.
cases.
in
sante
fe
railroad
against
grant
brothers,
it
was
held
that
a
railroad
carrying
material
for
a
construction
contractor
who
was
constructing
an
extension
of
its
line
was
not
acting
as
a
common
carrier
and
the
contract
limiting
its
liability
was
valid.
in
grant
smith-porter
ship
company
against
rhode,
this
court
was
faced
with
that
bothersome
problem
of
where
the
limit
of
maritime
jurisdiction,
exclusive
maritime
jurisdiction,
lies
the
problem
that
had
its
genesis
in
southern
pacific
company
against
jensen.
there,
a
new
vessel
was
being
constructed.
she
was
lying
in
navigable
waters,
the
willamette
river
at
portland,
oregon.
a
man
was
injured
while
he
was
working
on
her
in
such
position.
it
was
held
that
the
oregon
compensation
statute
could
apply
because
such
work
on
a
new
vessel,
not
yet
in
commission,
did
not
directly
affect
commerce
or
navigation.
i
suggest
then
to
your
honor
that's
--
honors
that
the
--
this
act
did
not
redefine
the
employers
and
that
southern
pacific
company
in
operating
a
wheel
foundry,
manufacturing
cars
and
in
constructing
a
new
yard
was
not
acting
as
a
railroad
and
was
not
acting
as
a
common
carrier
whether
or
not
it
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
but
further
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
it
was
not
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.secondly,
that
the
congress
did
not
wipe
out
the
definition
of
congress
evolved
by
this
court
in
the
course
of
adjudication
of
some
30
years.
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
act,
commerce
is
transportation,
all
work
so
closely
connected
to
it
has
to
be
practically
a
part
of
it
and
that
to
get
the
true
meaning
of
the
amendment
of
1939,
it
must
be
read
with
this
court's
established
and
untampered
with
definition
of
interstate
commerce
as
though
it
were
in
the
act
and
as
though
the
new
and
added
paragraph
read
this
way,
"that
it
applied
only
to
employees
of
a
carrier.
any
part
of
whose
duties
as
such
employee
shall
be
the
furtherance
of
interstate
transportation
or
work
so
closely
connected
to
it
as
to
be
practically
a
part
of
it
or
shall
in
any
way
directly
or
closely
and
substantially
affect
such
commerce."
we
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
was
no
intention
and
there
is
no
language
which
will
bring
within
this
act
the
heart
of
which
was
to
provide
a
remedy
where
men
exposed
to
the
peculiar
hazards
of
railroad,
although
it
will
cover
other
men
if
they
fall
within
its
language.
the
event
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
it
eliminates
the
moment
of
injury
rule,
your
honor.
so
for
instance,
if
a
man
is
employed
as
a
switchman
and
he's
handling
indiscriminately
interstate
and
intrastate
cars,
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
with
what
work
he
was
doing
at
the
precise
moment
of
injury.
likewise
a
man
in
a
repair
shop,
whose
work
is
general
work
of
the
repair
shop,
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
now
whether
he's
making
running
repairs
on
the
car
or
a
locomotive
that's
in
or
assigned
to
interstate
commerce.
as
always,
that's
part
his
work,
we
don't
care
what
he
was
doing
at
the
moment.
we
are
not
concerned
with
whether
a
locomotive
is
withdrawn
from
service
or
a
car
is
withdrawn
from
service
at
the
time
that
--
of
the
injury
of
the
particular
workman.
and
i
think
in
the
course
of
adjudication
in
the
state
court,
signed
in
the
lower
federal
court
has
indicated
this
that
likewise
that
is
brought
under
the
act,
those
borderline
cases
such
as
collins
and
schware,
where
this
court
at
one
time
went
one
way
and
then
overruled
itself.
so
that
the
effect
has
been
to
remove,
to
state
it
shortly,
the
moment
of
injury
rule
and
to
make
the
operation
of
this
statute
more
uniform
and
its
application
more
positive
to
those
men
who
fall
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
although
i
would
not
concede
as
much
as
your
honor
would
impute
to
me
for
the
word
"furtherance"
as
a
gist
in
this
particular
statute.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
the
word
of
"directly
or
closely
--
closely
and
substantially
affecting
interstate
commerce"
accepting
this
court's
language
of
commerce
would
be
transportation
and
work
directly
or
closely
and
substantially
affecting
transportation
would
have
to
come
pretty
close
to
the
instrumentalities
of
the
transportation
itself.
and
that
is
certainly
true
if
this
court
is
to
adhere
to
its
use
of
the
word
"direct"
as
in
the
harrington
case.
that
then
leaves
for
us
these
borderline
cases
in
the
back
shop
and
the
accessorial
facilities
such
as
sand
houses,
water
towers,
oil
tanks
and
those
things,
which
fairly
can
be
said
in
the
sense
to
which
i
apply
that
language,
to
be
the
furtherance
of
that
transportation,
although
not
directly
or
closely
and
substantially
affecting
it.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
well,
if
you're
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
we're
getting
on
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
well,
i
can
answer
that
in
the
history
of
this
--
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
in
the
schmidt
case,
this
court
decided
that
the
handing
him
his
lunch
was
part
of
interstate
commerce
because
they
applied
the
act
to
a
camp
car
cook.
that
case
was
later
criticized
or
in
--
this
court
indicated
that
it
might
be
questioned
in
the
overstreet
case,
this
court
said
so
in
view
of
that
series
of
cases
in
1931
and
1932
but
the
lunch
box
case
was
a
very
close
one.
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
i
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
i
would
say
that
that
could
very
well
fall
within
the
definition
of
furtherance.
the
case
certainly
give
me
pause
there
is
overstreet
against
(inaudible)
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that
was
the
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that
was
the
language
that
was
used
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
was
before
this
court
in
the
little
steel
case
and
it
was
used
in
anyway
affect
commerce
if
my
recollection
is
correct
but
without
those
qualifying
words
“directly
or
closely
and
substantially.”
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
well
--
mr.
arthur
b.
dunne
that,
your
honor,
is
true
when
we
branch
over
into
--
into
another
field
and
when
the
question
is
now
the
power
of
commerce
and
not
merely
the
question
of
construction
of
the
statute.
