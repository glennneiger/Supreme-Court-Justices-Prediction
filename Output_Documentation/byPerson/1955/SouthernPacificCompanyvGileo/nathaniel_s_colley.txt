mr.
nathaniel
s.
colley
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
two
clients,
each
of
whom
recovered
jury
verdicts
for
damages
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
certainly
as
to
one
of
them,
i
believe
that
he
would
have
been
covered
by
the
act
had
he
been
injured
even
prior
to
1939.
the
reasons
for
feeling
that
way
will
be
made
to
appear,
but
i
think
one
of
the
first
things
which
i
should
do
is
to
try
to
clarify
for
the
court
the
meaning
of
the
language
used
in
the
statute.
now,
i
think
the
best
way
to
get
an
understanding
of
what
the
amendment
is
all
about
is
to
refer
to
the
statements
made
by
senator
austin
when
these
words
were
placed
in
the
statute.
on
page
64
of
mr.
dunne's
brief
in
a
footnote
he
labeled
100c,
senator
austin's
language
is
setout
and
i
think
perhaps
it
will
put
to
rest
once
and
for
all
what
was
meant
when
the
language
was
inserted.
if
the
court
will
notice
this
very
thorough
and
excellent
brief
by
the
petitioners,
senator
austin
was
concerned
as
to
what
courts
might
interpret
this
language
to
mean.before
his
suggested
change,
the
language
have
simply
been
--
that
coverage
would
include
anybody
who
in
anyway
affected
commerce
but
senator
austin
wanted
some
understanding,
he
wanted
to
use
a
word
of
art
as
mr.
justice
reed
has
said
and
so
he
suggested
words
of
art
which
had
settled
meaning,
and
he
suggested
that
the
language
should
be
changed
to
read
in
anyway
directly
or
closely
and
substantially
affecting
commerce.
now,
what
do
those
words
mean?
they
mean
what
the
court
said
they
meant
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
proof
of
that
is
to
quote
mr.
austin
--
senator
austin,
my
amendment
was
to
substitute
for
the
words
"or
in
anyway
--
the
words
"directly
closely
and
substantially."
that
is
the
law
as
it
is
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
against
the
jones
&
laughlin
steel
corporation
and
other
cases.
now,
what
senator
austin
was
saying
was
i
want
to
use
words
that
the
--
that
the
supreme
court
has
already
given
meaning
to
and
the
meaning
i
intend
to
give
in
this
statute
is
a
meaning
the
supreme
court
has
given
in
the
jones
&
laughlin
steel
case.
i
think
that's
the
complete
answer
as
to
what
was
meant.
as
to
whether
or
not
the
amendment
to
the
act
did
anything
other
than
enlarge
the
definition
of
the
employee,
my
answer
is
simply
this.
the
congress
was
satisfied
with
the
meaning
of
the
word
"employer"
as
used
in
the
old
act.
congress
had
no
intention
of
extending
at
least
as
the
debates
developed.
congress
did
not
intend
to
extend
the
word
"employer"
to
anybody
except
railroads
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
but
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
extend
the
courage
to
employees
of
railroads
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
with
them
having
been
satisfied
with
the
definition
of
employer,
not
wanting
to
include
truckers,
not
wanting
to
include
express
companies,
not
wanting
to
include
anybody
except
railroads
as
had
heretofore
been
done,
they
left
that
part
of
the
act
intact.
but
when
it
came
to
the
employee,
the
intention
was
to
make
a
very
broad,
a
very
general
and
a
very
sweeping
inclusion.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
did.
as
refers
to
my
two
clients,
mr.
moreno
and
mr.
aranda,
i
think
the
cases
are
different
from
the
others
and
for
that
reason
require
some
very
brief
statements
of
the
particular
facts
as
related
to
them.
this
is
especially
true
since
the
facts,
as
stated
in
the
very
excellent
brief
of
the
petitioners,
doesn't
--
is
not
quite
correct.
let
us
say
it
tells
the
truth
but
not
the
whole
truth.
and
i
think
in
order
to
understand
the
implications
of
these
cases
we
must
know
the
whole
truth.
the
retarder
yard,
where
moreno
worked,
was
an
integrated
project
composed
of
three
parts,
one
part
was
called
a
receiving
yard,
another
part
was
called
a
classification
yard,
another
part
was
called
a
departure
yard.
of
those
three
yards,
the
retarder
yard
was
composed.
now,
the
retarder
yard
then
was
one
integrated
project
composed
of
those
three
parts.
when
then
was
the
yard
finished?
when
was
it
put
into
operation?
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
they
state
that
the
yard
was
not
put
into
operation
until
april
of
1952,
where
moreno
was
injured
in
december
of
1951.
but
if
the
court
will
notice
the
language
in
the
brief
and
in
the
argument,
he
says,
“no
revenue
trains
went
over
the
lines
until
then.”
i
don't
know
when
that
ever
became
a
test
whether
the
train
was
a
revenue
line
and
not
how
would
an
employee
ever
apply
that
test,
how
would
he
ever
know
whether
this
freight
train
was
a
revenue
train
or
whether
it
was
just
a
train
that
the
president
of
the
corporation
was
riding
on,
he'd
have
no
way
of
knowing
that.
so
i
think
the
revenue
train
test
is
no
test
whatsoever.
but
the
record
shows
that
the
depart
--
that
the
first
part
of
this
project,
the
receiving
yard
was
completed
in
august
of
1951
and
put
in
operation,
that
was
several
months
before
moreno
was
ever
employed.
it
--
the
record
also
shows
that
in
october,
the
old
main
line
was
--
was
being
removed
so
that
the
retarder
yard
could
be
reconstructed
and
the
receiving
yard
was
in
use
as
a
classification
yard.
so
then
this
whole
project
was
partially
completed
before
moreno
started
work.
and
by
the
time
he
was
injured
much
of
it
was
in
operation.
let's,
for
example,
ask
this
question.
suppose
moreno
had
been
injured
on
the
receiving
yard,
which
was
completed
in
august,
then
would
he
have
been
covered
by
the
act?
i
think
the
answer
must
be
yes,
because
this
was
a
part
of
the
yard
in
operation
for
all
purposes
in
interstate
commerce
and
he
would
have
been
covered
by
even
prior
to
the
1939
amendment.
then
if
he
had
been
hurt
while
he
was
removing
cross
ties
from
the
old
main
line
so
it
could
be
relocated,
certainly,
he
would
have
been
covered.
now,
does
his
right
to
recovery
under
the
act
depend
upon
which
part
of
the
yard
he
gets
hurt
in?
that
would
seem
to
be
a
strange
test
to
me.
the
next
thing
is
that
this
yard
where
moreno
was
hurt,
the
very
day
he
was
injured,
the
very
moment
of
his
injury,
he
was
using
cross
ties
from
the
old
main
line
helping
to
construct
this
so-called
new
main
line
in
this
retarder
yard.
now,
if
we
look
at
this
situation,
suppose
he
had
been
hurt
while
he
was
taking
the
old
cross
tie
out
of
the
old
main
line
which
had
been
in
operation
all
of
these
years,
then
would
he
have
been
covered
by
the
act?
i
can
think
of
no
way
to
exclude
him.
forget
when
he
takes
that
same
cross
tie
over
to
another
spot
and
starts
to
put
it
down
so
as
to
make
a
new
method
of
switching,
you
exclude
him.
that
would
seem
to
be
a
form
of
technicality
which
certainly
i
cannot
understand.
now,
it
is
also
significant
that
moreno
lived
on
the
railroad
tracks
in
what
they
call
outfit
cars.
in
other
words,
it
put
a
little
square
track
off
--
off
the
main
line
and
he
lived
in
freight
cars
what
they
call
outfit
cars
and
he
commuted
from
the
railroad
track
where
he
lived
over
to
the
retarder
yard
where
he
worked.
mr.
nathaniel
s.
colley
just
a
few
more
words
about
the
moreno
case,
the
one
involving
the
employee
and
the
retarder
yard.
fortunately,
we
have
a
case
which
is
almost
identical
with
the
moreno
case
decided
by
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
and
cited
in
briefs
of
all
parties,
i
believe.
it's
agostini
--
agostino
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
company.
in
this
case,
the
worker
was
engaged
in
a
project
which
was
a
realignment
of
the
railroad
tracks
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
and
also
to
straighten
some
curves
and
shorten
the
track.
in
other
words,
it
was
an
improvement
over
an
existing
highway
of
interstate
commerce.
well,
if
the
agostino
case
was
directly
decided
as
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
was,
then
certainly,
this
court
must
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
the
moreno
case
because
what
moreno
was
doing
was
nothing
more
than
helping
to
improve
an
existing
highway
of
interstate
commerce.
this
is
shown
in
the
record
by
the
testimony
of
the
employees
of
the
southern
pacific
company
other
than
mr.
moreno
himself.
the
testimony
show
that
this
project
was
conceived
to
switch
over
a
change,
an
existing
method
of
switching
freight
trains.
heretofore,
the
southern
pacific
company
had
been
switching
trains
in
that
same
area
of
roseville,
california
and
in
fact,
they'd
been
doing
it
for
many,
many
years,
but
they
had
been
doing
it
by
manual
switching
or
by
switch
engines.
somebody
conceived
the
idea
that
it
would
be
an
improvement
over
their
method
of
switching
if
they
had
what
they
called
"gravity
switching"
by
a
retarder
yard.
in
order
to
achieve
this
improvement
in
that
existing
method
of
switching
or
in
--
in
order
to
effect
this
improvement
in
their
existing
highway
of
interstate
commerce,
they
did
many
things.
one
of
the
things
they
did
was
to
tear
up
the
old
mainline
of
the
passenger
train,
at
that
point,
the
old
interstate
line
and
move
it
to
the
north,
a
few
hundred
feet.
now,
in
tearing
up
the
old
mainline,
of
course
they
used
the
cross
ties.
from
the
old
mainline,
they
used
a
rail,
they
used
everything
they
took
up
in
helping
to
construct
these
new
project.
so,
in
every
sense
of
the
word,
this
was
really
simply
an
improvement
over
an
existing
method
of
switching
and
that
that
testimony
is
from
the
supervisory
employee
of
the
railroad
company
in
exactly
that
language
and
it
appears
in
the
record.
to
that
extent
then
that
this
certainly
was
not
a
new
project.
if
we
define
new
as
the
usual
way
of
defining
it,
something
which
didn't
exist
before,
they
certainly
had
a
method
of
switching.
this
was
just
an
effort
to
improve
it.
to
that
extent,
it
was
simply
maintenance
and
repair.
mr.
nathaniel
s.
colley
yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
mr.
nathaniel
s.
colley
yes,
and
i
think
the
--
to
that
extent,
the
right
--
if
i'm
--
i'm
correct,
the
raymond
case
was
a
tunnel.
mr.
nathaniel
s.
colley
well,
i
think
there
are
distinctions
but
let
me
say
that
i
don't
think
the
raymond
case
was
correctly
decided,
but
i
think
there
are
distinctions
between
moreno
and
--
and
--
agostino
and
raymond.
i
would
say
that
the
raymond
case
was
not
directly
decided,
but
i
would
say
this
that
the
court
would
not
have
to
go
quite
that
far
to
accept
and
affirm
the
judgment
in
the
moreno
case,
but
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
--
that
i
think
raymond
was
incorrectly
decided
especially
if
we
take
senator
austin's
words
at
their
face
value
when
he
inserted
these
words
in
this
act,
when
he
said
that
i'm
simply
--
i
want
to
use
words
of
art,
words
of
the
court
has
given
a
meaning
to
and
use
those
words
and
it
would
be
an
anomaly
now,
it
seems
to
me,
for
this
court
to
come
along
and
say
to
senator
austin,
"we
--
we
see
what
you
said.
we
know
what
had
in
mind
but
we're
not
going
to
accept
what
you
said.
we're
going
to
do
something
else
entirely.
we're
not
going
to
extend
it
as
far
as
you
said,
you
call
yourself
extending
it."
i
--
i
don't
think
this
court
will
do
that.
as
to
aranda,
let
me
say
that
the
brief
of
the
petitioners
is
not
full
in
that
regard
either
as
to
the
statement
of
the
facts.
very
briefly,
let
me
tell
you
what
aranda
case
is
all
about.
mr.
aranda
worked
in
the
wheel
foundry
but
his
wheel
foundry,
the
wheel
foundry
which
he
worked
is
nothing
but
a
repair
shop.
now,
i'll
tell
you
why.
there
is
no
means
known
to
the
industry
to
repair
a
worn
out
freight
train
wheel
except
to
take
it
and
remold
it
into
another
wheel
but
it's
the
same
metal,
it's
the
same
wheel,
they
just
have
to
recast
it.
what
aranda
did
was
simply
one
chain
in
the
whole
repair
process.
if
a
wheel
went
bad
in
el
paso,
texas,
somebody
had
to
take
the
wheel
off
the
train,
put
it
on
the
flat
car
and
ship
it
to
sacramento
to
be
repaired.
now,
suppose
a
man
taking
the
wheel
off
had
been
injured,
would
he
be
covered
by
the
act?
certainly,
he
would.
suppose
a
man
bringing
it
to
sacramento
from
el
paso
gets
hurt
on
the
flat
car,
would
he
be
covered
by
the
act?
what
about
the
man
lifting
it
at
the
wheel
foundry,
and
remember
that
the
wheel
foundry
is
located
within
the
shops
of
the
southern
pacific
company
and
the
flat
car
brings
the
wheel
to
the
wheel
foundry
lifted
by
a
crane
from
the
flat
car
over
into
the
wheel
foundry.
now,
the
man
lifting
it
from
the
flat
car
to
the
wheel
foundry,
he
is
certainly
would
be
covered
by
the
act.
then
when
it's
molded
to
go
back
out
to
portland,
what
about
the
man
putting
it
back
on
the
flat
car,
he
certainly
would
be
covered
by
the
act.
children
versus
thompson
was
exactly
that.
it
wasn't
a
wheel
foundry
but
he
was
lifting
wheels
from
a
storehouse
into
a
flat
car.
then
if
this
is
one
continuos
chain,
why
pick
out
rocky
aranda
and
say
to
him,
"because
you
were
the
man
actually
repairing
a
wheel
so
it
could
go
back
into
interstate
commerce
from
when
it
had
just
come,
we're
going
to
limit
you
and
not
include
you
in
the
coverage
of
the
act."
actually,
in
aranda's
duties,
he
had
to
help
not
only
mold
the
wheel
but
help
get
the
wheels
ready
to
be
put
back
on
the
flat
car
to
go
back
out.
it
is
not
true
that
these
wheels
where
all
put
in
storage
as
it
indicated
in
the
brief
of
petitioner.
the
truth
is
and
the
record
shows
that
these
wheels
when
molded,
part
of
them
was
sent
directly
from
the
wheel
foundry
to
portland,
oregon
where
they
were
fix
onto
axles
and
either
sent
to
be
used
on
running
repairs
or
sent
to
use
on
new
construction
or
whatever
the
case
might
be.
in
other
words,
they
were
not
all
stored.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
were
stored
or
not
as
i
understand
the
law,
but
it
is
not
true
that
they
were
all
stored.
actually,
the
repair
--
the
work
of
aranda
was
repair
of
wheels
in
a
wheel
foundry
by
the
only
method
or
repair
known
to
the
industry.
and
for
that
reason,
aranda
should
be
covered
by
the
federal
employer
liability
act
like
all
the
rest
of
the
employees.
and
in
closing,
let
me
say
that
if
you
asked
me
how
far
the
act
should
go,
my
only
answer
is,
send
it
and
take
it
as
far
as
senator
austin
said
take
it
and
send
it
because
senator
austin
put
the
words
in
the
statute
and
he
said
he
was
putting
them
there
using
words
of
art
that
this
court
had
defined
and
understood
and
how
will
congress
ever
know
how
to
enact
the
legislation
with
specific
meaning,
if
it
can't
look
to
this
court
to
the
definitions
already
given
and
write
those
definitions
into
the
statue
and
expect
this
court
to
follow
you.
thank
you.
