justice
john
m.
harlan
your
opponent
concedes
that
that
was
approved
before
1939,
they
would
not
have
been
under
the
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
that
mean
that
in
your
view
all
railroad
employees
are
now
covered?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
leaving
out
the
collateral
activities
for
mining
or
oil
properties
and
what
not,
why,
under
your
definition,
isn't
any
employee
of
the
railroads
engaged
only
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
very
sense,
why
isn't
anything
that's
being
done
by
such
employee
in
furtherance
of
such
company?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
isn't
the
--
possibly
the
right
construction
but
i
just
want
to
be
clear
in
my
mind
what
you're
--

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
i
get
what
you're
saying
then
really,
you're
saying
that
we
wipe
out
all
of
the
cases
pre-1939.
we
start
with
a
new
series
of
distinctions
now
that
stems
from
whatever
definition
you
choose
to
give
to
this
language
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
that
the
section
of
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
we
had
the
old
redman
case.
