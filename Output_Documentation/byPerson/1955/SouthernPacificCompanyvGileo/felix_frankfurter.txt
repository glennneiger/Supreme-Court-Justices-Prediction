am
i
right
in
inferring
that
this
is
purely
a
statutory
question?

justice

how
would
that
may
be
--
mr.
dunne,
may
i
ask
over
those
words
“directly
or
closely
and
substantially"
are
the
very
accurate
and
have
been
used
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
to
ask
you
whether
the
--
the
reference
to
the
report
of
the
--
underlying
the
1939
act,
was
there
a
report
in
the
senate
in
regard
to
the
amendments
that
you've
just
pointed
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
it
is.
all
right,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
in
your
brief,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
trouble
you,
mr.
dunne,
i'd
like
to
--
the
phrase
that
mr.
justice
douglas
called
attention,
“furtherance
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce”,
was
that
in
the
proposed
amendment
of
section
1
at
the
time
that
the
report
in
6
(1)
was
committed
to
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
report
was
through
a
bill
which
has
that
phrase?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
in
the
report
unless
i
read
too
late
for
years,
i
well
may
have,
there's
no
reference
to
that
phrase.
there
is
a
reference
to
--
closely
related
to
the
facts
or
a
part
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
dunne,
are
there
any
cases
in
the
lower
court
at
least,
and
not
in
this
court
dealing
with
a
company
or
it
is
a
non-operating
activity
relating
to
a
plainly
interstate
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
within
or
without
the
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
in
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
what
this
do,
mr.
dunne?
you
referred
that
if
on
the
stop
in
the
second
paragraph
where
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce
that
would
absorb
every
activity
in
relation
to
the
common
carriers
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
following
clauses
implicit,
is
redundant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position?
now,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
very
well.
at
any
event,
you
say
it
has
given
the
breadth
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
gave
it,
then
the
rest
of
the
stuff
is
in
commerce
of
indulging
even
if
it's
--
if
speaking
of
judicial
words,
is
that
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
put
to
you
is,
contrary
wise,
counsel
should
give
some
scope
to
everything
in
here,
in
the
paragraph.
and
therefore
what
scope
you
gave
in
furtherance
of
interstate
commerce
that
is
apart
from
or
different
from
and
that
does
not
make
that
redundant
to
the
clause
that
follows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
a
early
case
i
think
and
judge
learned
hand
was
still
in
the
district
court
(inaudible)
following
much
by
which
if
you
hand
--
follow
the
harrington
protest
between
oiling
and
car
and
handed
them
a
profile
and
come
in
the
district
to
do
it
that
claim
would
be
in
interstate
commerce,
if
you
added
in
his
lunch
casket
or
lunch
case,
that
would
be
not
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
probably
would
never
even
make
any
sarcastic
or
crooked
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
remarks
about
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

now
or
would
you
have
to
decide
that
without
the
furtherance
with
his
(inaudible)
justice

are
you
--
you
would
have
--
you
would
say
that
was
in
furtherance
of
it
to
follow
an
outline
so
he
could
leave
the
engine
of
his
body
was
in
furtherance
of
that.
justice
felix

it
might
not
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
directly
and
closely
and
substantially
across
upon
the
terms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
work
interchangeable
or
is
the
choice
for
each,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
one
day
he
works
on
one
day
and
one
day
he
works
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
we
were
told
a
minute
ago.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
their
differentiation,
mr.
hilderbrand,
so
that
we
have
to
look
at
each
of
the
facts
pertaining
to
each
individual
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
point
you
make
and
does
it
become
necessary
to
examine
the
repairs
with
reference
to
each
that
they
complained
of?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
can
be
solely
irrelevant
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
work
and
do
not
work
interchangeably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
is
relevant
then
we
do
have
to
examine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
right
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
anything
about
it,
that's
why
i'm
asking
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
not
the
kind
of
situation
that
if
this
is
relevant,
if
this
is
all
there
is
that
senator
neely
had
in
his
report.
he
wasn't
talking
about
a
man
who
worked
for
nine
months
as
one
kind
of
a
job
and
the
next
nine
months
in
another
kind
of
a
job.
he
was
talking
about
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
talking
about
the
niceties
where
the
other
car
coming
in
and
another
car
coming
out,
all
the
time
works
interchangeably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
where
is
the
point
where
you
--
where
--
what
is
the
report?
all
i
know
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
one
you
referred
to
which
deals
with
the
situation
that
you
have
where
a
man
works
for
a
long
stretch,
endurable
stretch
on
--
on
non-interstate
transportation
and
stuff
in
the
technical
sense
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
transportation
stuff
and
then
for
extended
period
on
the
other
one,
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
constantly
shifting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
--
but
this
doesn't
follow
that
congress
laid
down
the
same
criterion
and
scope.
the
railway
labor
act
isn't
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why,
for
myself,
i
think
the
howard
case
has
long
been
decided,
that
is
the
question
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can't
because
congress
would
let
us
with
a
different
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
effect
to
interstate
commerce
which
is
in
the
wagner
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
limited
as
this
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
uses
the
word
"to
affect
commerce,"
does
that
affect
commerce
qualified
as
this
paragraph
is,
was
closely
substantial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
statute
or
in
the
opinion
construing
the
statute,
which?
