mr.
thomas
c.
perkins
may
it
please
the
court.
my
--
my
client
is
what
mr.
hilderbrand
has
referred
to
as
a
car
toad.
that's
--
in
other
words,
he's
really
a
railroad
man
just
like
the
railroad
refers
to
engineers
sometimes
as
fog
heads.
they
refer
to
mr.
eufrazia
as
a
car
toad.
now,
he
started
in
this
particular
branch
of
work
in
september
of
1950
at
the
carshop
no.9
in
sacramento.
now,
when
he
started
into
work
there,
he
was
on
this
new
car
program
which
is
the
same
program
that
he
was
on
when
he
got
hurt.
however,
in
the
interval
between
the
time
when
he
first
started
on
this
new
car
program
and
the
time
of
his
injury,
he
was
switched
over
to
this
repair
work
where
he
was
doing
all
sorts
of
repairs
including
running
repairs.
in
march
of
1950,
he
was
raised
to
the
status
of
an
advanced
helper.
now,
an
advanced
helper
is
a
man
and
who
was
qualified
to
do
all
sorts
of
work
which
a
carman
is
qualified
to
do.
he
could
ream,
he
could
weld,
he
could
rivet
and
he
was
used
for
all
those
various
things.
now,
in
june
--
rather
on
june
--
rather
june
13th,
1951,
he
was
taken
from
the
repair
work
and
he
was
assigned
in
this
program
which
he
was
originally
on
of
reaming
ends
in
these
gondola
ends.
now,
the
tools
he
was
working
with
are
much
the
same
as
they
use
in
the
repair
work.
he
was
working
in
a
place
that
was
setup
as
one
integrated
whole,
it
was
all
under
the
supervision
of
mr.
harry
heiky.
mr.
heiky
had
the
privilege
of
assigning
these
men
from
one
place
to
the
other,
that
is
from
repairs
to
new
construction
and
for
instance
if
mr.
eufrazia
were
reaming
a
hole
on
this
new
end,
he
could
say,
â€œwell,
mr.
eufrazia,
we'd
like
you
to
go
and
ream
a
hole
in
this
car,
they
got
sideswiped."
he
could
switch
him
around
and
in
fact
the
immediate
supervisor
of
mr.
eufrazia
was
mr.
fagan
and
he
was
simultaneously
supervising
this
assembling
of
new
cars
and
also
assembling
the
repair
or
old
cars.
in
other
words,
that
here
you
have
this
foreman,
the
--
and
one
immediate
--
but
immediately
above
mr.
eufrazia
in
the
chain
of
command
and
we
have
mr.
fagan
not
only
supervising
the
activities
of
the
event
in
this
assembling
of
new
cars
but
also
we
have
him
supervising
this
repair
work.
as
mr.
hilderbrand
has
pointed
out,
all
these
work
was
going
on
side
by
side,
the
men
were
interchangeable
and
from
time
to
time
they
did
get
reassigned,
for
instance,
when
due
to
absenteeism,
when
a
man
was
absent
from
this
assembly
line.
i
believe
that's
admitted
in
the
record.
when
was
absent
from
the
assembly
line,
mr.
heiky
could
go
over
and
get
a
man
from
the
new
car
work
and
tell
him
go
ahead
and
be
on
this
construction
work,
that
is,
if
some
of
these
men
gets
sick
or
layoff.
i
don't
think
it
was
really
quite
as
a
precision
or
clock
work
arrangement
as
mr.
dunne
states.
i
think
it
back
when
my
client
was
injured,
there
were
two
men
off
of
that
job,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
he
happened
to
get
injured
of
this
reaming
here.
now,
it's
very
important
to
mr.
eufrazia
merely
to
be
under
this
act.
for
one
thing,
he
belongs
to
the
southern
pacific
hospital
association.
he
pays
his
dues
there.
if
he
gets
ill,
he's
--
it's
unlike
the
men
that
are
in
--
of
course,
theoretically
it
might
sound
very
fine
to
say
and
perhaps
to
a
theorist
that
might
sound
very
fine
to
say
that
this
man,
if
he's
not
under
this
f.e.l.a,
he's
got
a
remedy,
he's
got
the
workmen's
compensation
but
our
workmen's
compensation
act
isn't
really
designed
to
cover
car
toads
or
railroad
carman.
this
man
is
a
railroad
man.
now,
he
belongs
to
the
southern
pacific
hospital
association,
if
he
gets
hurt
or
if
he
gets
ill,
he
goes
down
to
the
southern
pacific
hospital
down
in
san
francisco
or
possibly
to
our
emergency
hospital
in
sacramento.
he's
treated
by
these
railroad
doctors.
he
contributes
into
that
in
a
fund
and
the
railroad
also
contributes
in
this
fund
and
all
of
our
railroads
in
the
west
at
any
rate
have
such
arrangements,
therefore,
it's
more
or
less
geared
with
the
f.e.l.a,
it's
not
geared
with
our
workmen's
compensation
act.
mr.
thomas
c.
perkins
well,
probably
not.
that
was
--
however,
i
understand
that
--
i
believe
that
this
wording
has
put
him
under
that
--
that
1908
already
meaningless
or
rather
1939
amendment.
well,
they
seem
to
go
pretty
far
on
that
act.
however,
i
think
that
under
this
latest
act
what
he
was
doing
even
if
--
even
if
his
whole
work
was
a
construction
on
these
new
cars,
i
think
what
he
is
doing
directly
and
substantially
affects
interstate
commerce,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
that's
certainly
is
in
furtherance
of
it,
he's
building
new
cars.
you
can't
make
this
--
this
railroad
run
without
cars.
they
have
to
have
this
to
supplement
their
existing
rolling
stock
which
--
which
is
what
they
were
really
doing.
these
cars
wear
out.
when
they
wear
out,
where
they
take
them
into
carshop
no.9
and
they
fixed
them
and
then
when
they
needed
more
either
through
an
expansion
of
business
or
through
the
complete
demolition
of
these
cars
where
they
replace
them
with
new
cars
and
they
did
both
of
these
activities
in
carshop
no.9,
both
activities
being
under
the
supervision
of
mr.
heiky
so
it's
really
one
integrated
deal
like
if
its
--
what
they
call
a
freight
car
department.
they've
got
one
department
that's
carshop
no.9,
that's
freight
car
department,
they
have
this
assembling
program
there
and
they
have
these
repairs
of
all
sorts
in
carshop
no.9
which
distinguishes
it
from
carshop
no.3
which
is
the
passenger
car
department
or
the
machinist
department.
it
was
all
really
an
integrated
whole.
now,
this
--
as
i
started
to
say
that
this
--
it
is
very
important
to
mr.
eufrazia,
it's
to
his
welfare
to
be
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
even
in
our
fine
compensation
act
which
we
have
in
california
which
is
much
superior
due
to
the
efforts
of
our
governor
in
making
--
and
--
and
with
some
help
from
our
legislature
in
passing
a
rather
liberal
compensation
act,
still
the
amount
that
these
men
actually
get
under
this
act,
if
that's
their
consideration,
doesn't
compare
with
what
they
could
even
settle
all
these
suits
for
under
the
f.e.l.a.
because
under
the
f.e.l.a,
there's
a
word
for
pain
and
suffering
or
disfigurement
and
all
those
items
whereas
under
the
comp
act
they
--
even
in
our
california,
it's
more
or
less
based
on
your
disability
to
earn
your
living.
you've
got
to
show
that
your
finger
is
off
or
something
so
that
you
can't
--
so
that
you're
disabled.
and
also
the
minimum
now
i
think
of
california
is
$40
a
week
which
certainly
doesn't
compare
with
what
they
earned
when
they
earned
$300
a
month
and
over.
so
that
they
can
even,
with
no
strain
at
all,
come
out
financially
much
better
under
this
f.e.l.a.
and
of
course
california
is
one
of
the
better
or
the
best
comp
acts
but
you
take
many
states
like
down
in
--
several
of
them,
the
minimums
run
--
i've
--
i've
listed
them
in
my
brief
on
page
9,
the
various
--
a
month
it
goes
down
to
$25
weekly
in
arkansas
and
the
death
benefits
vary
from
$17,500
in
minnesota
down
to
$6000
in
wyoming.
also
they
have
various
defenses,
for
instance,
in
some
of
them
the
willful
failure
to
use
safety
devices
is
a
complete
defense
in
13
states
and
then
they
have
its
--
in
other
words,
i
think
in
the
railroading
industry
you
ought
to
have
a
uniform
act
that
applies
to
all
railroad
workers
whether
they
happen
to
do
have
a
good
fortune
of
being
injured
in
california,
whereas
liberally
it
--
or
relatively
liberal
or
the
misfortune
of
being
injured
in
one
of
the
states
where
the
compensation
is
much
lower.
and
as
mr.
dunne
says,
two
of
these
states
don't
have
any
workmen's
compensation
act
as
i
understood
him
to
say
but
more
than
that
there's
something
more
because
five
of
these
states
exclude
all
railroad
workers.
those
are
the
states
of
texas,
florida,
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
and
the
state
of
washington.
those
are
five
states
that
if
you
work
for
any
railroad
intra
or
interstate,
some
of
them
work
in
any
common
carrier,
some
of
them
say
any
hazardous
occupation.
the
man
has
to
bring
a
common
law
remedy.
in
washington,
they
adopt
the
f.e.l.a,
they
say
you
can't
distinguish
between
--
in
their
statute,
you
can't
distinguish
between
people
that
are
in
intra
or
interstate
commerce
when
they
work
for
a
railroad,
it's
all
the
same
problem
so
they
have
a
little
f.e.l.a.
however,
in
the
states
of
florida,
you'll
find
they
have
a
limited
fellow
servant
document,
it
has
to
be
a
fellow
servant
of
the
superior
quest
or
another
category
and
not
a
--
just
a
person
like
two
section
hands
such
as
we
have
in
the
f.e.l.a.
in
other
words,
if
one
section
hand
picks
another
one
in
the
foot
with
a
peck,
we
have
liability
on
the
f.e.l.a.
in
the
state
of
florida,
you
wouldn't
have
that.
in
the
state
of
south
carolina,
you
wouldn't
have
that.
in
the
state
of
virginia,
they
also
have
that
limited
doctrine.
and
then
also
in
north
carolina
and
--
and
let's
see,
one
of
this
other
states
they
have
a
limited
assumption
of
risk
policy.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
show
that
they
violate
a
statute
or
the
employee
assumes
the
risk.
therefore,
i
think
that
for
the
sake
of
uniformity,
both
in
the
industry,
it's
very
confusing
to
these
men
that
they're
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
on
one
track.
if
they're
reaming
there
and
they
say
you're
in
the
f.e.l.a.,
this
fellow
workman,
he's
right
on
the
next
track.
he
is
doing
the
same
thing,
he's
reaming
too
and
then
you
say
one
of
these
men
is
in
the
f.e.l.a.,
i
was
going
to
explain
that
to
his
client
and
say
well
--
you'll
come
in
and
say,
"well,
mr.
jones
over
her,
he
was
reaming
and
he
hurt
his
knee.
i
think
i
should
have
my
action
on
the
f.e.l.a."
i
understood
he
got
a
pretty
good
selling
in
his
case.
i
understood
he
got
$10,000.
you
tell
me
here
i'm
reaming
on
a
new
car
and
all
i
can
get
is
$1000.
well,
that's
pretty
arguing
to
explain,
i
mean
the
technicality
of
that
--
your
client.
and
so,
also,
i
think
looking
at
it
from
a
wider
scope,
from
nation
to
nation
or
rather
from
state
to
state
that
they
should
be
uniformity
treated
and
if
you
exclude
these
people
in
carshop
no.9
here
that
rather
so
it's
been
made,
it
happened
to
be
a
new
construction
and
you
create
chaos
because
--
and
it
will
be
very
hard
on
these
railroad
men.
i'll
conclude
my
argument
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
they're
willing
to
ask
me?
