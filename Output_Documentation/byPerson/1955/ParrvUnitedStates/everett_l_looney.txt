mr.
everett
l.
looney
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
i
think,
if
your
honors
please,
this
case
is
before
the
court
in
actuality,
involves
a
conflict
between
the
integrity
of
the
law
on
one
hand
and
the
hypocrisy
of
the
law
on
the
other.
in
order
to
properly
present
that
thesis,
i
believe
it
proper
to
say
that
in
about
may
1954,
the
attorney
general
said
to
the
united
states
district
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
texas,
houston
division,
the
case
of
george
b.
parr
for
an
investigation
under
internal
revenue
code
section
145
(b)
charging
--
with
--
with
charge
an
attempt
to
evade
and
defeat
a
large
portion
of
his
income
for
the
year
1949,
1950
and
1951.
i
think
it's
well
to
have
in
mind
that
at
the
time
the
case
was
sent
to
the
houston
division
that
under
the
venue
provision
of
the
18
u.s.c.
section
3237
the
offense
to
be
investigated
could
have
been
investigated
and
indictment
could
have
been
returned
if
the
evidence
warranted.
and
either
the
southern
district
or
the
houston
district
or
the
southern
--
southern
district
or
the
western
district
says
section
3237
provides
that
where
an
offense
has
begun
in
one
district
and
completed
in
another,
it
may
be
dealt
with
in
either
district.
now,
of
course,
that
limitation
is
--
there's
a
limitation
put
on
that
by
--
by
rule
18
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
the
case
must
be
dealt
with
finally
in
the
division,
in
the
district
wherein
the
offense
was
committed.
so,
after
about
six
or
seven
or
eight
months
of
grand
jury
investigation
in
the
houston
division,
attended
by
somewhat
of
a
production
in
the
way
of
publicity
and
not
usually
attended
upon
a
grand
jury
investigation,
one
which
cause
the
trial
judge
at
corpus
christi
to
admonish
counsel
when
the
case
was
later
called
for
arraignment
that
no
such
publicity
would
be
permitted
from
thereon,
except
if
it'd
be
from
word
spoken
in
open
court.
the
grand
jury
returned
the
indictment
on
november
the
15th,
1954
and
the
case
was
filed
in
the
corpus
christi
division,
that
being
the
division
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
the
offense
had
been
committed.
the
indictment
alleged
that
the
offense
had
been
committed
by
preparing
and
causing
to
be
prepared
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
for
filing
in
the
collector's
office
at
austin
in
the
western
district,
a
false
return
by
depositing
the
same
in
the
sub-office
of
the
collector
at
corpus
christi
in
the
corpus
christi
division.
the
case
was
immediately,
in
accordance
with
local
rules,
put
on
the
trial
calendar
on
november
the
15th.
on
december
the
1st,
the
case
was
called
for
trial
in
the
words
of
the
judge
for
arraignment,
actually.
and
the
defendant
was
called
upon
to
plead
at
which
time
he
plead
not
guilty,
asking
secured
leave
of
the
court
to
--
to
have
until
january
the
3rd,
1955
within
which
he
filed
such
motion
as
might
be
thought
to
be
appropriate.
before
the
expiration
of
that
time,
the
defendant
filed
for
a
motion
with
the
court
--
with
the
clerk,
a
motion
for
discovery,
a
motion
for
particulars,
a
motion
for
--
for
production
and
inspection
of
documents,
a
motion
for
subpoena
duces
tecum,
and
lastly,
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
from
the
corpus
christi
division
in
the
southern
district
to
the
laredo
division
in
the
southern
district.
the
--
the
court
had
given
the
government
14
days
within
which
to
reply
to
such
motions
as
it
might
be
filed.
then
timely,
the
government
filed
opposition
to
each
of
the
motions
including
an
opposition
to
the
motion
for
change
of
venue,
the
venue
motion
being
the
change
of
being
under
rule
21
(a)
on
the
allegation
that
there
were
so
greater
prejudice
against
the
defendant
in
the
corpus
christi
division
that
he
could
not
there
secure
a
fair
trial,
and
with
a
prayer
that
it
be
moved
to
laredo
division.
the
government
countered
that
motion
by
saying
that
there
was
no
prejudism
in
the
corpus
christi
division.
that
if
there
was
prejudice
in
the
corpus
christi
division,
there
was
equally
as
much
prejudice
against
the
defendant
in
the
laredo,
the
victoria
and
the
brownsville
division.
that
actually,
if
the
defendant
wanted
to
change
a
venue
where
he
could
get
a
fair
trial,
the
government
suggested
it
should
go
to
the
houston
or
the
galveston
division
where
they
said,
“we
--
we
know
more
about
than
you
do,
about
where
you
--
where
you
can
get
a
fair
trial."
and
so,
the
government
resisted
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
only
to
the
extent
that
they
said
--
they
--
they
chose
houston
and
galveston.
now,
that's
important,
if
your
honors
please,
because
that's
where
the
indictment
that
i
have
spoken
of
was
actually
returned
in
the
houston
division,
30
--
30
miles
between
houston
and
galveston,
the
same
news
media
in
--
in
both
areas.
but
they
only
set,
if
it
was
to
be
set
anywhere,
first
of
all,
it
should
be
kept
at
corpus
christi.
if
it
was
to
be
set
anywhere,
it
should
be
set
to
houston
or
--
to
the
houston
division
or
--
or
the
galveston
division
and
so
the
government
contended.
and
the
defendant
contended
in
his
motion
and
it
--
and
it
was
supported
by
numerous,
a
hundred,
over
a
hundred
affidavits
although
500
newspaper
clippings,
that
not
only
could
he
not
secure
a
fair
trial
in
the
corpus
christi
division,
but
that
every
other
division
in
the
district
had
been
polluted
to
perhaps
a
lesser
extent
with
this
news
media,
this
terrific
publicity
that
the
court
found
had
attended
upon
the
defendant
for
years
and
years
down
there.
that
the
only
place
that,
if
it
was
to
be
transferred,
that
the
defendant
wanted
to
be
transferred
was
to
laredo
division.
now,
it's
maybe
important,
if
your
honors
please,
to
remember
that
the
defendant's
home
--
home
is
about
halfway
between
corpus
christi,
which
is
where
court
is
held
in
the
corpus
christi
division,
and
laredo
where
court
is
held
in
laredo
division.
there
was
a
contest
as
i've
said.
the
government
severely
contested
the
motion
for
change.
now,
the
government
never
did
in
their
motion
contesting
them
in
their
reply
to
the
motion
for
moving
for
a
change
of
venue.
they
never
did
once
say
that
the
government
could
not
get
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
in
laredo
if
the
case
was
transferred
to
laredo.
they
did
in
their
brief,
subsequently,
say,
not
in
their
contest
to
the
motion
but
in
their
brief.
they
did
say
that
the
government
might
be,
under
a
severe
handicap
in
the
trial
of
the
case
at
laredo,
should
it
be
transferred
to
laredo.
now,
that
was
filed
in
early
january.
on
april
the
27th,
judge
kennerly,
a
retire
judged,
to
whom
the
matter
had
been
transferred
for
hearing
by
judge
allred,
the
presiding
judge
of
that
division,
took
up
the
entire
matter
and
found
specifically.
he
said,
“it's
not
only
shown
about
preponderance
of
evidence,
but
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
the
defendant
could
not
receive
at
the
hands
of
a
jury
selected
in
the
matter
provided
a
fair
trial
in
the
corpus
christi
division.”
he
says,
“the
government
suggested
i
send
it
to
houston
or
galveston.
they
oppose
my
sending
it
to
victoria,
brownsville
or
--
or
victoria,
brownsville
and
--
and
laredo.”
the
government
opposes
that.
now,
i
find
no
--
he
says,
“i
find
no
support
for
the
charge
or
the
contention
made
in
the
government's
brief
that
the
government
would
be
under
any
handicap,
under
the
slightest
handicap,
if
this
case
would
be
tried
to
--
transferred
to
laredo
for
trial.”
he
said
that
“i
am
of
the
opinion
that
rule
21
(a),
authorizing
a
transfer
does
not
authorize
and
neither
transfer
it
anywhere,
except
laredo
under
the
motion
because
the
defendant
has
only
conceded
to
be
tried
out
of
this
district
in
the
motion
which
designates
laredo."
he
went
on
to
say
that,
“from
the
evidence
that
i've
heard
here,
if
it
was
within
my
power,
i
would
transfer
the
case
to
texarkana.”
that's
on
the
northern
limit
of
texas,
northeastern
limit,
or
to
amarillo
which
is
on
the
northwestern
limit
of
--
tip
of
texas
are
as
far
away
from
the
seat
of
trouble
as
i
could.
but
as
i
can
see
the
rule,
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
see
to
keep
it
at
corpus
christi
or
i
must
transfer
it
to
laredo,
and
finding
no
reason
--
no
reason
why
the
government
would
be
under
any
sort
of
a
handicap
if
it
goes
to
laredo,
i
transfer
it
to
laredo.
now,
that
was
on
april
the
27th,
1955.
on
may
the
3rd,
1955,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
sent
a
telegram
to
--
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
texas
in
care
of
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
western
district
of
texas
in
which
he
said
--
what
page
is
that?
mr.
everett
l.
looney
in
which
he
said
this,
“hella
tight
rush.”
it
was
sent
at
9:17
a.m.
eastern
standard
time,
may
the
3rd,
1955.
malcolm
r.
wilkey,
the
district
attorney
for
the
southern
district,
tell
the
united
states
attorney
at
san
antonio,
the
district
attorney
for
the
western
district,
“you
are
authorized
to
dismiss
indictment
pending
in
southern
district
of
texas
against
george
b.
parr
for
violations
of
section
145
(b)
internal
revenue
code
1939
if
and
when
the
indictment
returned
in
western
district,
signed
h.
brian
holland,
the
assistant
attorney
general.”
mr.
everett
l.
looney
if
and
when
and
in
--
the
indictment
is
returned
in
the
western
district.
now,
the
indictment
was
returned
subsequent
to
9:17
a.m.
central
standard
time
--
eastern
standard
time,
8:30
when
--
was
when
the
telegram
was
received,
central
standard
time
at
san
antonio.
the
indictment
was
returned
by
the
grand
jury
between
that
time
in
5
o'clock
that
afternoon
of
may
the
3rd,
or
on
may
--
at
5
o'clock
that
afternoon,
mr.
wilkey,
the
district
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
texas,
he
was
in
attendance
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
western
district
of
texas,
telephoned
long
distance
to
judge
allred
who
preside
at
corpus
christi
and
requested
that
the
indictment
there
pending
be
dismissed,
advising
him
that
--
that
the
western
district
had
returned
the
second
indictment,
and
that
he
wanted
it
dismissed.
and,
that
judge
allred
in
the
memorandum
that
was
filed,
directed
him
to
file
a
motion
in
the
usual
way,
setting
forth
his
reasons
for
it
and
which
motion
was
found
on
may
4th.
and
judge
allred
on
that
day,
signing
business
--
court
business
at
brownsville
and
not
as
if
enough
time
to
take
it
up,
transferred
the
motion
to
judge
kennerly
to
the
southern
district
at
houston
to
pass
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
prior
to
5
--
subsequent
to
5
o'clock
of
may
the
4th
or
may
the
3rd,
the
date
of
the
indictment,
we
learned,
i
learned
of
the
return
of
the
indictment
from
the
press.
and
i
called
judge
allred
and
told
him
that
in
view
of
what
had
happened,
i
had
--
i
assumed
that
they
were
--
that
the
government
was
planning
on
seeking
an
indictment
of
the
--
seeking
a
dismissal
of
the
first
indictment,
and
advised
the
judge
that
the
defendant
wished
to
be
heard
in
opposition
to
that
move
if
that
move
was
made
at
which
time
he
advised
me
that
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
had
previously
called
him
from
san
antonio
and
told
him
that
that
was
the
move
he
has
to
make,
that
he
was
going
to
make.
and
so,
the
order
of
transfer
to
judge
kennerly
for
hearing
gave
the
defendant
the
right,
required
that
the
defendant
be
given
notice
of
the
filing
and
he
be
placed
on
the
motion,
tell
him
to
be
disposed
of
in
accordance
with
the
local
rules.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
i
did
not
understand
you,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
no,
sir,
i
have
no
quarrel
about
that.
now,
that
was
a
sequence
--
sequence
of
events.
on
--
on
may
the
16th,
if
i
recall
the
date,
the
motion
came
on
to
be
heard
before
before
judge
kennerly
at
houston.
at
which
time,
the
united
states
attorney
told
the
court,
once
again,
judge
kennerly
in
this
instance,
the
same
as
he'd
told
judge
allred
that
the
defendant
has
no
standing
to
be
heard
on
this
motion
that
i'm
--
to
present
to
you,
but
judge
kennerly
thought
otherwise.
and
the
motion
to
file
contained
a
statement
of
reasons
for
dismissal,
and
that
is
to
say,
accompany,
it
was
a
statement
for
reasons
for
dismissal.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
yes,
sir,
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
page
22,
if
your
honor
please.
there,
it
stated
the
--
it
stated
the
--
the
facts
that
--
that
had
been
--
that
the
district
attorney
of
san
antonio,
they
were
about
to
change
personnel
due
to
change
in
the
administration
and
--
there.
and
then,
again,
urged
that
some
of
the
witnesses
for
the
government
might
be
under
some
embarrass
mode
or
he
might
not
testify
as
freely
at
laredo
as
they
would
--
as
they
would
testify
in
the
western
district.
and
they
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
when
they
had
lodged
the
indictment
in
the
corpus
christi
division,
that
neither
the
united
states
attorney
or
the
attorney
general
had
ever
dreamed
that
the
case
might
be
transferred
from
the
corpus
christi
division.
they
could
--
they
couldn't
foresee
that
that
might
have
happened,
notwithstanding,
of
course,
rule
21
(a)
provides
for
that
in
the
--
in
--
in
any
kind
of
case
where
prejudice
may
exist.
now,
judge
kennerly,
as
it's
shown
in
the
record,
when
he
came
on
to
hear
that,
he
doubted
--
he's
doubted
whether
or
not
he
had
any
discretion
in
the
matter
of
either
granting
or
denying
the
motion
to
dismiss.
he
commented
that
for
24
years
on
the
bench,
both
before
and
after
the
adoption
and
the
effective
date
of
rule
21
(a),
he
had
dismissed
cases
on
motion
of
the
government
attorney
without
any
hesitation
and
they
never
had
failed
to
dismiss
one.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
what's
that?
mr.
everett
l.
looney
under
rule
48
(a),
but
he
said
that
he
had
never
failed
to
do
that.
that's
the
dismissal
statute,
which
--
which
ruled
--
which
rule
by
--
of
course
provides
that
the
united
states
attorney
can,
by
leave
of
the
court,
dismiss
a
case
provided
that
if
after
his
trial
has
begun,
it
must
not
be
done
without
the
consent
of
the
defendant.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
he
said,
“i
--
i
have
never
hesitated
doing
it
before
there
was
rule
48
(a)
or
since
there
was
a
rule
48(a)."
mr.
everett
l.
looney
yes
sir.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
now,
he
said
--
he
said,
“the
district
attorney
opposed
us
offering
any
evidence
in
support
of
our
opposition
to
the
dismissal.”
but
the
court
said,
“if
he
had
any
discretion
at
all,
then
he
should
hear
evidence
if
any
party
wanted
to
offer
it.”
and
we
--
over
the
protest
of
the
district
attorney
developed
evidence
from
the
district
attorney
himself,
that
there
had
been
no
problem
that
had
arisen
since
the
time
the
first
indictment
was
returned
down
to
the
time
the
second
indictment
was
returned
that
made
--
gave
him
any
problem
of
truth
as
to
the
first
indictment,
from
his
own
--
from
his
own
testimony
and
from
the
--
developed
and
shown
in
this
record.
in
other
words,
he
wasn't
in
a
position
of
having
found
after
his
return
of
the
first
indictment
that
he
lack
proof
in
support
of
this
first
indictment
on
the
basis
of
venue
or
some
other
person
or
some
other
reason,
and
that
he
could
get
that
proof
in
the
western
district.
that
--
his
testimony
show
that
that
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
unorthodox
action
that
i
think
he
took.
now,
of
course,
this
case
--
this
case
never
could
have
arisen
if
these
recent
things
have
happened
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
which
were
became
effective
in
march
1946.
now,
when
--
when
judge
kennerly
went
to
announce
his
decision
of
dismissing,
he
said
that
“i
can
--
the
defendant
--
the
defendant
has
offered
no
good
reason,
has
shown
no
good
reason
why
i
should
not
dismiss
this
indictment,
and
if
i
have
a
discretion
in
the
matter,
i
must
exercise
it
and
allow
the
indictment
to
be
dismissed.”
mr.
everett
l.
looney
no,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
no,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
in
good
conscience,
yes,
i
made
that.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
no,
sir.
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
initially,
he
certainly
had
the
--
the
attorney
general
could
send
it
to
either
--
either
of
the
two
district.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
no,
sir.
that
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
no,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
no
sir,
no
sir.
the
--
except
for
the
fact
that
the
motion
to
transfer
had
been
filed
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
--
and
except
for
the
fact
that
the
government
had
joined
issue
on
that
motion.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
not
at
all.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
the
--
the
--
our
point,
if
your
honors
please,
is
that
when
we
filed
a
motion
for
change
of
venue,
had
the
government
didn't
come
forward
even
at
that
late
day
and
said,
"we
want
to
dismiss
this
indictment.
we
have
indicted
or
we
will
indict
somewhere
else."
i
don't
believe,
if
your
honors
please,
i
had
to
quarrel
in.
but
when,
your
honors
please,
when
they
did
--
when
they
--
what
they
did
was
they
joined
issue.
they
contested
us
right
down
to
the
last,
from
december
until
april
the
27th,
with
evidence
offered
by
both
sides.
and
what
our
position
is
that
when
the
--
when
the
--
that
that
contest
of
the
right
to
change
of
venue
was
an
election
on
their
part,
and
if
the
venue
then
was
fixed
in
laredo
for
the
trial
of
this
offense.
now,
we
don't
contend
as
the
government
seems
to
believe
that
we
contend,
we
don't
contend
that
after
the
venue
had
been
changed
from
corpus
christi
to
laredo,
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
--
could
the
court
give
his
lead
to
dismiss
that
indictment.
we
make
no
such
contention
if
the
--
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
it
would
have
authorized
the
--
the
trial
court
in
the
exercise
of
a
sound
discretion
to
have
ordered
or
approved
of
the
dismissal.
for
instance,
if
--
if
the
proof
of
venue
something
that
happened,
the
witnesses
have
died
or
if
the
government
was
unable
to
proove
the
facts
sufficient
for
venue
in
the
corpus
christi,
but
after
the
first
indictment
was
lodged
in
corpus
christi,
or
a
number
of
other
reasons
it
might
be
that
they
could.
but
we
contend,
if
your
honors
please,
that
for
the
purpose
as
this
record
shows
of
directly
circumventing,
taking
a
short
cut,
as
the
--
as
the
government
counsel
has
pointed
out
in
their
brief,
"we
negated"
is
the
language
they
used.
we
negated
the
order
of
judge
kennerly,
transferring
this
case
from
corpus
christi
to
laredo
by
the
simple
expedient
of
going
over
and
getting
an
indictment
in
another
district
and
then
coming
back
and
dismissing
the
indictment
first
brought,
although,
we
had
contested
you
as
best
we
could
for
four
months
and
then
we'd
come
--
come
out
on
the
losing
end
of
the
order.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
i
know
of
no
misrepresentations
made.
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
and
we
think
he
should,
if
your
honor
please,
for
that
very
reason.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
i
think
he's
--
i
think
his
overall
opinion
delivered
from
the
bench
shows
that
he
thought
his
authority
was
very
narrowly
restricted.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
i
think
he
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
that's
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
--
that's
our
position,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
no,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
our
position,
if
your
honor
please,
is
--
is
that
he
didn't
in
fact
exercised
his
discretion
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
--
but
that
there
were
--
but
there
were
no
--
no
facts
before
him
which
would
even
--
had
he
been
exercising
a
discretion,
which
will
have
authorize
him
to
--
to
dismiss
for
exercising
a
discretion
under
the
circumstances
--
and
says
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
well,
we
say
he
had
a
discretion,
if
your
honor
please,
but
that
the
discretion
that
the
evidence
in
the
case
all
pointed
to
one
fact,
and
that
was
that
the
government
was
taking
this
action
purely.
the
record
shows
we
say
purely
for
the
purposes
of
circumventing.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
under
the
--
under
the
showing
that
was
made
before
him.
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
well,
actually,
our
position
is
somewhat
vague
due
to
the
remarks
i
think
perhaps
of
the
--
of
the
judge
who
said
that
if
i
have
a
discretion,
i
must
exercise
it
and
i
must
allow
this
dismissal.
and
because
he
says,
"because
the
defendant
has
shown
no
good
reason
why
i
should
not
dismiss
it."
mr.
everett
l.
looney
i
recognize
that,
mr.
justice.
our
--
our
position
is
exactly
as
you
stated
it,
that
he
didn't
exercised
any
--
any
discretion.
he
didn't
exercise
a
discretion.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
and
their
--
with
this
moderate
step,
i
think
properly.
and
--
but
had
he
exercised
a
discretion
that
the
--
the
government
wholly
failed
to
show
any
reason
for
the
dismissal,
except
to
circumvent
the
order
of
transfer
and
then
it
shows
on
its
phase
that
it
should
have
been
denied.
now
that
--
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
i
stated
well
enough.
now
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
yes,
sir.
they
stated
some
reasons.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
oh,
yes.
yes,
indeed.
i
filed
a
written
opposition,
if
your
honor
please,
to
their
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
offered
evidence
by
questioning
the
district
attorney,
which
is
in
the
record
in
which
i
think
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
real
reason
for
the
dismissal
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
page
30.
and
then,
there's
a
--
a
written
--
following
that
on
page
34,
there's
a
reported
transcript
of
the
proceedings
had
on
the
motion,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
my
--
the
basis
of
my
opposition,
if
your
honors
please,
was
that
we
had
shown
that
prejudice
existed
in
--
in
the
corpus
christi
division,
showed
greater
prejudice
the
defendant
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial.
number
two,
the
government
had
failed
to
show
any
reason
why
it
should
not
be
transferred
to
laredo.
now,
i
recognize
the
fact
that
--
that
the
court
might
well
have
refused
to
grant
our
motion
if
the
government
would
--
the
government
should
have
been
put
under
any
handicap
or
any
prejudice
by
transferring
it
to
laredo.
and
--
and
that
what
they
were
doing
was
merely
--
the
--
the
court
--
the
rules
not
allowing
them
to
move
themselves
for
a
transfer,
that
--
that
they
were
setting
themselves
up,
the
attorney
general's
department,
the
united
states
attorney,
setting
themselves
up
as
an
appellate
tribunal
to
review
the
action
of
the
trial
court
in
granting
that
transfer.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
any
additional
reasons
to
that?
mr.
everett
l.
looney
my
--
my
reason,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
--
that
i
urge
is
that
the
attorney
general
has
no
right
to
review
a
district
judge's
order
of
transfer
and
to
set
aside,
or
as
the
government
says
in
their
brief,
to
negate
it
by
their
expedient
that
they
appear
to
fall
in
this
case.
now,
there
has
been
--
there
are
--
there
are
four
--
there
are
four
different
supreme
courts,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
that
if
condemned
that
very
practice
and
said
they
won't
let
it
stand.
those
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief.
that
the
--
and
then,
there's
a
case
i'd
like
to
call
--
call
your
honors
attention
to
by
the
--
by
the
eighth
circuit,
which
is
comparable
that
as
language
that
i
think
is
clearly
pertinent
to
this.
such
acts,
i
say
that
his
acts
in
opposing
this
motion
to
transfer,
such
acts
are
inconsistent
with
and
oppose
to
any
desire
to
transfer
the
case.
they
are
consistent
only
within
intention
to
and
amount
to
the
further
prosecution
of
the
suit
in
the
court
in
which
it
then
was.
congress
did
not
intend.
i
would
say
that
the
court
in
promulgating
this
and
these
rules,
21
(a),
21
(b),
and
21
(c),
congress
--
that
this
court
did
not
intend
that
a
party,
the
government
in
this
case,
could
voluntarily
proceed
in
the
court
where
the
suit
was
filed
until
he
became
dissatisfied
and
then
transfer
the
case
by
the
simple
expedient
of
causing
the
first
indictment
to
be
dismissed
after
having
such
authority
conditioned
only
on
the
return
of
a
second
indictment.
i
think
i
have
the
--
now,
your
honor,
there
are
--
i'm
not
going
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
it
was
filed
with
--
by
the
district
attorney
with
his
motion
to
dismiss,
believed
to
dismiss,
and
wtih
his
statement
of
reasons
for
desiring
to
dismiss.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
they
were
all
there,
yes,
sir.
now
--
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
--
there's
some
70
odd
cases.
i
think
all
of
us
or
both
sides
due
an
apology
to
the
court
for
having
presumed
to
cite
so
many
cases.
actually,
there
is
--
there's
no
court.
there's
no
court.
of
course,
i
have
been
able
to
find
to
pass
on
this
question
except
the
--
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas
from
which
i
appeal
in
the
circuit
court
which
decided
it
on
a
two
to
one
decision
that
it
was
nonappealable
order.
now,
i
have
--
i
have
said
that
--
i
have
said
when
i
began,
if
your
honors
please,
that
i
think
this
a
--
this
is
a
question
that
resolved
itself
around
a
determination
of
what
a
right
is,
what
a
right
vested
by
reason
of
these
transfer
of
proceedings.
i
have
said
that
i
think
it's
a
question
of
the
integrity
of
the
law
on
the
one
hand
and
the
hypocrisy
of
the
law
on
the
other
hand.
integrity,
certainly,
is
moral
soundness,
honesty,
freedom
from
corrupting
practice,
equity,
justice
and
fairness,
that's
the
integrity
that
i
speak
of.
the
antonym
of
that
term
is
hypocrisy.
hypocrisy
that
i
speak
of
is
a
playing
the
part
on
the
stage,
simulation,
a
feigned
or
fictitious
transaction
as
one
to
affect
a
fraud
or
one
done
as
a
matter
of
form,
outward
showed.
and
the
antonym
of
hypocrisy
is
honesty.
now,
i
say,
if
your
honors
please,
that
either
when
the
court
adopted
these
rules
and
when
they
joined
issue
with
us
on
this
motion
to
transfer,
and
when
we
spent
four
long
months
before
that
court
that
we
were
--
either
win
or
gained
a
right
of
substance
when
that
order
was
transferred
without
their
being
able
to
show
some
reason,
the
real
reason
for
dismissal
or
we
were
just
going
through
form.
mr.
everett
l.
looney
we
--
mr.
everett
l.
looney
sir?
mr.
everett
l.
looney
i
have
no
right
to
be
tried
at
any
one
place,
if
your
honor
please,
unless
procedurely
under
these
rules
when
the
case
was
transferred
down
there
by
the
court
given
the
power
to
act
on
it,
unless
we
get
that
procedural
right,
which
is
a
valuable
right,
and
which
should
not
be
taken
away
from
us
unless
the
government
showed
some
reason,
some
reason
of
basis
to
the
--
to
judge
kennerly
why
he
--
he
should
authorize
this
--
this
circumventing
of
judge
kennerly's
order.
and
i
say
it's
very
valuable
procedural
right
and
if
the
defendant
has
got
the
right
to
be
tried
according
to
the
law
as
if
they
have
proposition.
thank
you,
sir.
