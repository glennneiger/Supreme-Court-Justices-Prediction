chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
looney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thoron.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
the
government
felt
it
should
not
get
a
fair
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thoron,
before
you
get
to
another
subject,
let
me
get
back
to
the
merits
of
this
dismissal.
as
i
understood
you,
the
basis
of
your
proceeding
to
dismiss
was
that
you
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
in
laredo.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
didn't
say
that
a
little
while
ago.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
the
basis
of
it
as
i
understood
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
--
where
in
your
--
where
was
your
representation
to
the
court
on
your
dismissal
proceedings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
will
you
point
out
the
language
to
me,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
put
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
did
you
--
did
you
state
in
your
statement
of
reasons
for
dismissal
that
the
reason
you
wanted
to
dismiss
was
because
you
could
not
get
a
fair
trial
in
laredo?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
shouldn't
--
why
shouldn't
it
be
implicit?
why
shouldn't
it
had
been
said
in
your
--
in
your
motion
that
you
filed
on
may
4th,
1955,
if
--
if
that
contained
the
statement
of
your
reasons
for
dismissal
as
it
says
it
does?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
you
said
you
laid
all
the
cards
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
table,
so
i'm
wondering
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
didn't
lay
it
on
the
table
in
your
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
document?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
might
have
been
--
it
might
have
been
that
they
had
--
that
they
taken
it
away
from
the
--
from
the
mexican-american
border
in
the
first
instance,
but
they
--
they
initiated
the
proceeding
on
the
border,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
fairly
speaking,
that's
--
that's
40
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
didn't
say
exactly
on
the
border.
you
said
the
farther
removed
they
are
from
the
american-mexican
border
district
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
district.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
border,
american-mexican
border
district.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
weren't
considering
the
--
the
judicial
district
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
--
my
question
was,
did
you
state
it
at
all
in
the
written
document
which
you've
filed
as
a
statement
for
your
reasons
for
dismissal?
did
you
cite
the
thing
that
you
say
is
the
basic
reason
for
the
--
for
the
government?
the
reason
i
asked
you
that
is
because
i
noticed
in
--
in
your
written
statements
that
you
say
this,
“the
decision
of
the
attorney
general
to
initiate
proceedings
in
the
western
district
of
texas,
in
no
way,
is
to
be
construed
as
an
evasion
of
the
ruling
of
the
court
transferring
venue
from
corpus
christi
to
laredo.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
justify
that
with
your
other
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
the
reindictment
in
austin,
texas
was
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
ruling
of
the
court,
transferring
the
venue
from
corpus
christi
to
laredo,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
understand
it
unless
you
got
it
from
--
from
your
representations
in
the
statement,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fortas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fortas,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
still
have
