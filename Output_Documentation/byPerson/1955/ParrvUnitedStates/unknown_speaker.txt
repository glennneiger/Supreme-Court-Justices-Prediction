21.
unknown
speaker
what's
in
the
48
(a).
unknown
speaker
48
(a).
unknown
speaker
well,
the
government
did
state
there
were
reasons
for
the
transfer.
unknown
speaker
well
--
well,
where
is
your
--
where
is
your
paper
of
opposition?
i'm
looking
on
page
22
where
the
statement
of
reasons
for
the
dismissal
here.
where
--
where
is
your
statement?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
the
basis
of
your
opposition?
unknown
speaker
your
--
your
real
objection
was
--
i
see
on
page
32
but
the
united
states
attorney
did
not
say
the
statement
of
reasons.
he
said
he
is
or
has
been,
since
the
moment
it
was
pronounced,
just
pleaded
to
the
ruling
of
this
court,
moving
this
case
from
the
corpus
christi
to
the
laredo
division.
unknown
speaker
now,
that
--
did
--
did
you
have
any
other
reason
than
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
you
then
saying
that
the
reason
the
government
dismissed
this
case
was
in
order
to
get
a
change
of
venue?
unknown
speaker
do
you
point
it
out
in
the
term
on
the
following
brief
on
the
legal
points
as
to
the
appellant
to
transfer
it
outside
the
southern
district?
unknown
speaker
yes,
if
the
government
tried
to
make
that
issue
with
the
judge
and
the
judge
says,
i
don't
have
the
power,
so
i
have
to
transfer
it
to
houston
and
(inaudible),
i
suppose
it
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
you
turn
the
--
i
know
hindsight
is
better
of
course
but,
why
don't
you
turn
in
that
before
you
met
that
issue
or
what
the
issue
wasn't
in
the
--
on
the
change
of
venue?
unknown
speaker
so,
after
he
generally
said
again,
“you
--
how
you
have
decided
to
the
best
interest
as
to
turning
back
another
indictments
and
claim.”
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
you
do
that
when
you
first
learned
that
he
was
going
to
try
a
part
and
then
try
to
change
the
venue
to
laredo?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
was
in
the
question
that
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
a
question
of
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
that
terminated
that
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
and
terminate
the
possibility
of
prosecution
when
it
--
it
terminated
that
prosecution.
unknown
speaker
because
i
have
taken
certain
steps
--
unknown
speaker
--
here
that
i
brought
it
through
and
this
is
--
is
an
illegal
order
that
you're
entering
and
dismissing
my
indictment
--
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
there's
no
grievance?
unknown
speaker
this
claim
of
the
right
to
trial
--
unknown
speaker
--
was
a
right
to
a
trial
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
that
district,
that
division.
unknown
speaker
that
claim
to
a
right
to
be
tried
under
that
indictment.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
wrong.
it
may
be
right
or
wrong.
unknown
speaker
in
this
division.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
what
is
in
here.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
know
we
had
the
western
district
indictment
here.
unknown
speaker
if
that
has
been
tried,
there
has
been
no
steps
taken
in.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
power
of
the
attorney
general
to
dismiss,
to
set
up
the
court
before
a
transfer
and
the
power
after
a
transfer?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
have
the
choice
as
to
where
they
go,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
and
they
could
dismiss
--
they
could
have
dismissed
corpus
christi.
unknown
speaker
april
27.
unknown
speaker
but
kennerly
said
he
could
not
transfer
to
the
western
district
out
--
just
out
of
his
own
thought
and
thinking
about
it.
is
that
the
way
that
came
up?
unknown
speaker
put
it
outside
of
the
district.
