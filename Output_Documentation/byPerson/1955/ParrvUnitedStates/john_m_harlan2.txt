the
government's
--
the
government
made
no
misrepresentation
to
judge
kennerly
at
all
as
to
their
desire,
whatever
their
reasons
were,
to
try
this
case
in
the
western
district,
is
it?
it
was
fully
disclosed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
fully
disclosed.
in
other
words,
judge
kennerly
was
within
his
discretion
that
he
thought
the
government
is
trying
to
evade
his
order
into
a
(inaudible)
that
he
could
have
denied
the
motion
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
wouldn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
he
thought
he
did
--
he
would
have
done
that
if
he
thought
he'd
had
the
power
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
neither
of
you
gentlemen
has
said
a
word
yet
about
the
appealability
of
this
order.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
argued
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
argued
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
your
brief.
you
argue
it
in
your
brief
that
he
reports
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
argue
this
on
the
premise,
straightforward
premise,
that
there
was
--
although
there
was
an
exercise
of
discretion
here,
this
was
an
abusive
discretion.
you
don't
stand
on
the
proposition
that
there
was
a
failure
to
exercise
discretion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i've
got
it
then.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
couldn't
--
supposing
the
defendant
had
said
that
they
found
that
the
conditions
are
prejudicial
to
the
removed
district,
do
you
say
that
he
couldn't
make
a
motion
to
remove
further
to
another
district?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
can't
be
some
