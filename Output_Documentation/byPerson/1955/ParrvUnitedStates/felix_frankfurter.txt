if
and
when
what?
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
motion
of
transfer
by
judge
allred
to
judge
kennerly
is
taking
on
his
own
motion,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
transfer
by
judge
allred
of
this
motion
to
dismiss
was
taken
by
him
without
--
without
any
adversary
discussion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
no
quarrel
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
that
he
dismissed
the
--
the
matter
of
course
before
there
was
a
rule
48
(a).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
not
a
reason
for
innovation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
about
that,
it
was
being
practiced,
as
far
as
i
know
it,
before
there
was
a
rule
48
(a).
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
looney,
was
there
any
suggestions
that
the
western
district
had
no
jurisdiction
in
fact
to
make
any
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
no
indictment
could,
in
good
conscience,
be
brought
in
that
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
i
withdraw
that.
by
good
conscience,
i
mean
that
there
wasn't
jurisdiction
so
that
the
district
attorney
could
make
a
choice
when
he
would
remember.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
theory
of
the
jurisdiction
in
the
western
district.
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
objection,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
there
had
been
no
prior
proceedings,
this
indictment
in
the
western
district
couldn't
be
attacked
as
without
jurisdiction
in
that
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
are
you
contending
that
in
fact
judge
kennerly
has
discretion,
where
the
district
judge
had
a
discretion
under
48
(a)
to
grant
or
deny
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
having
such
a
discretion,
in
fact,
judge
kennerly
did
not
exercise
it,
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
case
should
be
sent
back
to
him
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
be
told
by
us
that
he
should
exercise
his
discretion,
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
this
case
to
be
--
he
didn't
have
a
discretion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
a
discretion
ordinarily
vested
or
vested
by
rule
48
(a)
to
grant
or
deny
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
the
--
made
by
the
government.
that
in
this
case,
he
had
no
discretion,
except
to
deny
that
motion
and
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
not
that
he
didn't
exercise
the
discretion,
but
he
had
to
exercise
it
the
other
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
want
to
repeat
my
question
but
in
a
different
form
because
it
makes
no
--
a
good
even
difference.
which
is
which
here?
i
can
understand
the
position
taken
by
you
that
on
the
--
that
from
what
judge
kennerly
said,
you
heard
that
in
fact
he
didn't
exercise
his
discretion.
and
for
all
unknowingly,
becomes
free
to
pass
on
this
motion
according
to
his
own
wisdom
and
sense
of
right,
he
might
have
denied
the
motion.
if
that's
your
position
then
the
remedy
that
you
have
is
to
have
the
case
sent
back
to
him
to
exercise
his
discretion,
but
it's
a
very
different
thing
if
you
maintain
that
under
48
(a),
which
does
give
a
circuit
--
a
district
judge
of
a
district
court
discretion.
in
this
case,
he
had
only
one
--
the
discretion
that
only
was
a
one-way
street.
if
it
only
refuse
the
motion
or
deny
the
motion
out
of
two
provisions
that
be
taken
at
the
same
time.
i
mean,
your
position
in
your
term,
but
they
are
very
different
positions
falling
for
different
remedies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they're
forcing
to
be
sent
back
to
impress
the
charges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
if
you
put
the
attorney
general's
telegram
or
is
that
available
to
you
before
judge
kennerly
on
this
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
before
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you've
asked
--
that's
what
you
had
in
mind,
i
take
it
in
answering
justice
harlan's
question
that
the
cards
were
all
on
the
table.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thoron,
can
you
please
tell
us
qualitatively
or
with
fair
confidence
what
the
law
is,
whether
the
district
judgment
by
the
rules
of
statutes
cannot
transfer
outside
of
judge
kennerly's
side?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
law
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
clear
on
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
petitioner,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
judge
kennerly
may
have
misconceived
the
quote
or
his
power
under
rule
21,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
maybe
if
judge
kennerly
misconceived
the
scope
of
rule
(a)
or
21
(a),
and
the
meaning
of
which
i
understand
the
petition
of
--
the
interpretation
given
to
it
by
petitioner
is
that
--
that
the
way
it
was
is
so-called
that
that
could
be
demonstrated
is
--
waived
a
little
bit
to
the
choice
of
another
venue
if
we
could
(inaudible)
he
wants
to,
no
more.
assuming
he
was
wrong
in
that,
and
assuming
whether
he
was
wrong,
the
district
would
be
with
that
and
under
rule
48
(a)
and
it
might
go
back
and
the
result
might
turn
out
to
be
exactly
what
we
have
now.
it
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
be
an
answer
to
the
fact
that
the
judge
should
act
suppose
to
the
rule
which
he
imposed
upon
him
and
not
otherwise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
you
might
get
exactly
the
same
result,
and
yet,
because
that
might
and
it
might
not
be
if
you
--
to
have
enact
according
to
law.
assuming
he
didn't
and
we
won't
need
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
a
difference
that
he
would
get
the
same
results
the
right
way
to
turn
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be
the
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
right
way
is
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
what
the
technique
means.
it
means
that
there
are
easy
question
on
the
merit
itself
that
you
don't
go
to
the
question
of
appealability,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
technique
is
a
good
word
for
that
(voice
overlap),
but
it
means
it
doesn't
shoulder
off
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
having
read
the
page,
in
which
if
it
isn't
appealable
now,
it's
never
appealable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
more
practical
preference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
thoron?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
and
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
--
was
this
document
written
by
tax
people,
whether
they
reflect
to
the
tax?
you
look
for
the
term
“evasion”
as
against
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
mean
the
brief,
i
mean
this
document
when
we
talk
about
evasion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
would
we
naturally
think
of
evasion
that's
something
the
law
forbid?
what
he
wanted
to
say,
he
was
not
doing
this
thing
in
order
to
violate
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
statement
that
was
made
doesn't
prove
that
in
texas,
they
used
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
distinguish
the
heike
case
for
me
for
this
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
was
the
case
where
there
was
a
judgment
on
the
plea
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
plea
went
against
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
then
was
told
the
plea
to
the
merit,
he
refused,
he
came
here.
one
of
the
justices
of
this
court
granted
a
writ
of
error.
the
government
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
writ
of
error
and
he's
probably
been
granted
that
was
fully
argued
before
this
court
and
the
writ
was
dismissed.
the
case
then
went
to
trial,
a
long
trial
of
six
weeks,
and
then
they
have
to
come
back
here
and
raise
that
question
back
to
the
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
distinguish
that
case
from
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
appeal
--
the
immunity
granted
by
the
immunity
statute
that
the
act
of
1893
certainly
was
vested
to
any
excerpt
of
that
in
the
meeting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

new
term
was
taken
out
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
certainly
was
vested
if
it
applied
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
understand
why
you
emphasize
the
fact
that
it
was
a
vested
right.
that
--
that
doesn't
determine
appealability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
true
on
the
heike
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
that
possible
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
break
in
on
your
argument
to
that
opinion
--
connection
to
which
the
consideration
drawn
into
that
opinion
vary
on
appealability.
suppose
the
government
hadn't
rule
to
dismiss
the
southern
district
indictment,
suppose
it
allowed
that
to
remain,
write
an
indictment
that
the
grand
jury's
indictment
to
file
in
the
western
district,
two
indictments
outstanding.
nothing
would
have
prevented
the
government
to
leave
the
southern
district's
indictment
by
going
in
and
move
the
trial
of
the
--
due
to
the
indictment
on
the
western
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
a
fact.
it
isn't
what
the
government
did.
the
government
didn't
need
to
lie
dormant.
the
government
moved
further
that
it
--
that
it
was.
the
government
did
acted
to
put
to
the
southern
district
indictment
out
of
permission
to
(inaudible)
it
and
leave
outstanding,
only
a
single
indictment
for
trial,
leaving
no
question
on
argument
that
--
that
there's
another
indictment,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
now
concerned
with
the
--
that
aspect
of
it.
if
that
is
so,
and
assume
the
--
how
can
you
say,
and
therefore,
there
is
only
the
western
indictment
notwithstanding.
it
is
the
government's
position
that
if
he's
tried
on
the
western
indictment,
convicted,
a
fatal
effect
of
the
judgment
of
conviction
of
the
sentence
if
sentence
there
be,
would
be
that
if
that
and
it
shouldn't
have
been
moved
here
by
the
dismissal
to
be
avoided
that
the
government
avoided
his
opportunity
to
be
tried
before
the
southern
--
in
the
southern
district,
the
--
the
conviction
under
the
western
district
is
therefore
faithfully
defective.
in
that,
we
would,
in
any
event,
let
it
tried
under
the
southern
district,
is
that
--
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
urge
that
the
dismissal
of
the
southern
district
indictment,
it
was
not
appealed,
you
must
couple
that
with
the
recognition
or
the
assertion
that
the
--
the
improper
dismissal
of
that
indictment
is
at
some
stage
or
rather
in
case
of
conviction,
an
appeal
for
grounds
not
necessary?
it
must
be
appealable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question
of
the
merit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
question
of
the
merit.
i'm
saying
that's
the
question
of
the
merit.
i'm
saying
that
this
dismissal
claimed
to
have
been
erroneous
in
law
must
be
derived
from
reviewability
at
some
state
if
it
had
been
in
the
conviction.
and
therefore,
if
the
government
is
urging
that
the
appeal
is
not
permitted,
it
must
admit
--
not
admit,
but
it
must
have
served
that
if
there
is
a
conviction
on
the
western
indictment,
the
dismissal
allegedly
improper,
either
subject
matter
or
potential
reversal
by
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
conviction
under
the
western
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
there's
merit.
if
there's
no
merit,
then
they
can't
reverse.
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying
that
the
--
there
must
be
an
appealable
error
urging.
if
there's
no
error,
there
--
there's
no
merit,
then
there's
no
merit,
there's
no
error.
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
do
you
work
out
that
if
there
is
a
conviction
on
the
western
indictment,
the
southern
indictment
having
been
dismissed,
what
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
eventually
can
say,
“the
improper
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
judge
in
dismissing
the
southern
indictment
vitiates
the
conviction
under
the
western?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because,
because
the
southern
indictment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
not
properly
dismissed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then,
you
are
saying
that
this
action
by
judge
kennerly
in
dismissing
the
southern
indictment
claimed
to
have
been
legally
improper
is
never
reviewed.
and
if
you
say
that,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
it
was
viewable
--
i
mean,
that
he
took
action,
which
on
the
assumption
--
i
must
make
the
assumption
that
it
was
an
erroneous
act,
because
otherwise,
you
haven't
got
any
--
any
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
assumption,
if
that
was
erroneous,
at
some
stage
or
another,
there
must
be
opportunity
to
review
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
care
whether
you
are
a
champion
or
i'm
a
--
a
great
supporter
of
it.
we're
guided
by
some
--
so
many
rules.
we're
not
guided
by
references
about
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
also
is
irrelevant
in
a
--
an
argument
that
the
government
ought
not
to
be
making
it,
it's
making
it
(inaudible)
that
isn't
that
question.
the
government
is
on
the
duty
and
we
are
on
the
duty
to
observe
the
rule
of
finality
and
your
(inaudible)
decision
on
the
merits
is
immaterial
and
sometimes
a
very
foolish
position
for
the
government's
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
that
has
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
sure
the
petitioner
would
welcome
if
you
would
dismiss
the
western
district
indictment
and
he
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unilateral
plus
the
action
of
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

but
in
the
case,
the
actual
statement
by
a
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
by
the
attorney
general,
the
judge
could
have
said
no
to
his
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
position.
i
merely
suggest
the
term
"unilateral"
is
not
descriptive
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
they
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
they
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
--
in
the
same
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
several
districts,
several
divisions
in
one
district
is
relatively
an
easy
figure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
must
contend
it
before,
as
i
should
think,
in
order
to
urge
a
reversal
or
rather
to
urge
that
he
committed
error.
you
must
urge
that
he
didn't
exercise
and
allowed
the
discretion,
otherwise,
the
remedy
assuming
the
agreement
is
to
send
it
back
to
him
to
exercise
this
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
answer
to
--
to
your
answer,
if
i
may
so,
to
justice
harlan's
question
is
that
under
those
circumstances,
could
he
have
exercised
the
discretion
in
the
way
which
you
did
and
therefore,
they
should
give
direction
to
him
to
undo
what
he
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
fortas,
suppose
as
i
did
in
my
question
for
mr.
thoron,
suppose
the
government
has
not
moved
the
way
they
did,
suppose
they
merely
reindicted
in
the
west
or
indictment
in
the
western
district?
i
take
it
you
agree
with
your
associates
that
there
was
no
jurisdictional
defect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
indictment
couldn't
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sustained,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
then
have
these
two
--
there
was
--
there
were
then
the
--
these
two
indictments
outstanding.
the
government
then
moved
the
western
indictment
for
trial.
what
power
would
the
judge
in
the
western
district
have
to
say,
“no,
you
must
try
the
southern
district
indictment
first”?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
he
would
have
to
exert
--
assume
he
had,
would
he
have
to
exert
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
we
still
have
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
i
think
your
speculation
is
not
unfair,
but
i
think
you're
unjust
to
your
imagination
to
say
that
it's
inconceivable
that
a
judge
would
agree
to
the
government's
motion
to
move
a
trial
before
a
hearing.
all
sorts
of
consideration
come
into
play
while
later
--
a
later
indictment
should
be
tried
first.
certainly,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know.
i
find
it
difficult
to
--
to
conceive
on
my
part
that
there's
any
--
any
restriction
of
law
that
would
compel
judge
rice
or
any
other
judge
in
the
southern
district
not
to
entertain
the
government's
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
cannot
be
compelled
(inaudible)
for
entertaining
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
circuit
read
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
circuit
read
it
as
a
dirty
word
and
it
doesn't
ask
the
question
of
how.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
phrase
what
the
nature
of
the
benefit
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
benefit
that
you
obtained.
you
said
you
obtained
the
order
of
benefit
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
would
like
you
to
spell
out
what
the
nature
of
the
legal
benefit
is
that
you
obtained
by
having
the
indictment
transferred
to
laredo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
seems
to
have
changed
his
mind
as
it
is
with
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
date
of
--
what
was
the
date
of
the
hearing
taken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
one
as
to
the
court
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
found
the
date
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
a
friendly
--
mr.
thoron,
most
essentially
you,
what
he
said
on
may
19th?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
he
--
but
he
did
--
i
understand
that.
but
he
did
agree
regardless
of
the
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
has
a
relation
to
the
administration
of
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
if
that
has
a
relation
to
the
administration
of
justice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
were
the
worst
abuses
of
american
criminal
justice
is
precisely
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
