justice
abe
fortas
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
i
regret
to
say,
that
corresponds
with
mr.
thoron's
last
statement.
there
was
no
such
finding
by
judge
kennerly
in
support
of
his
order,
granting
leave
of
court
to
dismiss
the
first
indictment.
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
in
the
few
moments
before
the
recess,
and
before
returning
to
the
questions
of
appealability
and
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
place
this
case
in
a
somewhat
broader
setting.
the
--
the
question
that
is
before
the
court,
in
my
opinion,
is
--
relates
to
the
distribution
of
power
between
the
judicial
system
of
the
united
states
and
its
prosecuting
arm.
the
question
is
whether
a
rule
in
an
order
entered
by
a
court
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
this
--
prescribed
by
this
court
can
be
circumvented
or
if
the
government
prefers
the
softer
term,
which
it
uses
in
its
brief,
can
be
negated
by
unilateral
action
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
that,
to
my
mind,
is
the
issue
and
i
believe
that
it
is
inescapably
here,
if
i
may
say
so.
justice
abe
fortas
i
believe
the
position
of
the
government
goes
a
little
further
as
i
shall
show.that
is
the
same
terms
of
the
position
of
the
government.
now,
if
i
may
direct
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
action
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
in
a
desired
position
that
the
failure
of
the
judge
to
say
no
was
error
which
should
not
be
permitted
by
this
court.
we
feel
that
this
court
should,
in
effect,
instruct
the
district
courts
that
once
an
order
of
transfer
has
been
entered
under
rule
21
(a)
and
it's
--
the
same
thing
is
true
under
rule
21
(b),
the
courts
may
not
accommodate
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
by
entering
an
order
of
dismissal
of
bad
indictment
so
as
to
permit
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
to
prosecute
for
the
same
offense
in
another
forum
that
he
has
made
--
that
he
has
selected
for
the
second
time.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
perhaps
not,
your
honor.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
that
is
to
say
i
think
that
where
there
are
--
let
us
suppose
that
the
grand
jury
in
the
southern
district
here
and
the
grand
jury
in
the
western
district
had
both
returned
indictments
for
this
same
offense,
then
i
think
it
is
the
attorney
general's
right
and
duty
in
some
of
the
cases
say,
to
select
the
forum
in
which
the
case
will
be
prosecuted.
he
has
a
right
of
election.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
here
is
what
happened.
for
20
years,
without
exception,
all
income
tax
cases
for
this
part
of
texas
had
been
brought
in
austin.
the
government
broke
with
that
tradition
of
20
years
to
bring
this
prosecution
of
this
particular
defendant
in
corpus
christi
for
the
first
time
in
20
years,
if
your
honors
please.
justice
abe
fortas
they
might
--
they
might
have
chosen
corpus
christi.
they
did
choose
corpus
christi.
a
motion
was
then
filed
to
transfer
the
case
to
laredo.
the
government
contested
that.
justice
abe
fortas
they
could
have
dismissed
at
that
point.
the
government
contested
that
and
it
was
a
bitter
contest
as
the
record
shows.
and
then,
a
solemn
order
of
the
court
was
entered,
transferring
the
case
to
laredo.
there
was
no
mention
at
the
time
of
the
contest
on
the
motion
to
transfer
of
the
possibility
of
austin
or
the
desirability
--
or
the
desire
of
the
government
for
austin.
and
it
was
only
after
the
court
had
transferred
the
case
to
laredo
that
the
government
then
decided
to
take
it
into
its
own
hands
to
bring
an
indictment
in
austin
and
prosecute
this
defendant
there.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
if
your
honors
please,
may
i
direct
your
attention
to
page
3
of
our
main
brief,
which
is
in
the
white
cover.
you
will
note
rule
21
is
set
out
there,
21
(a)
under
which
this
case
arises
provides
for
transfer
upon
motion
of
the
defendant
in
a
case
where
so
great
a
prejudice
exist
against
the
defendant
that
he
can't
obtain
a
fair
trial.
21
(b)
also
provides
for
transfer
upon
motion
of
the
defendant.
21
(c)
provides
that
when
a
case
is
transferred,
the
prosecution
shall
continue
in
the
district
or
division
to
which
the
case
was
transferred.
your
honors
will
note
that
this
rule
does
not
give
the
government
the
privilege
of
applying
for
the
transfer
of
a
case.
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
rules,
of
course,
there
was
no
right
of
transfer
in
the
defendant
whatsoever.
this
rule
gave
the
defendant
that
privilege
for
the
first
time
but
it
did
not
give
to
the
government
the
privilege
of
applying
for
a
transfer
of
the
case.
justice
abe
fortas
the
reason
for
that
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
mean
because
it's
constitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
it
could
give
the
government
a
right
to
transfer
from
one
division
to
another
of
the
same
district.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
it
gave
the
government
no
right
to
apply
for
transfer,
whatever.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
in
any
event,
there
is
no
such
right
in
the
government.
now,
the
basic
reason
that
justifies
that
is
that
the
government
has
an
initial
choice
of
venue
where
you
have
multiple
venues
as
frequently
happens.
the
government
can
choose
the
venue
in
which
it
is
to
file
its
case.
and
presumably,
at
least,
we
all
hope
that
the
government's
initial
choice
of
the
venue
in
which
to
bring
the
case
will
be
based
upon
considerations
of
proof
and
considerations
of
fairness
which
should
always
appeal
to
the
government.
now,
let
us
follow
this
through
if
we
may
--
if
i
may
and
direct
your
attention
to
rule
48
at
the
bottom
of
page
3,
which
governs
dismissals.
rule
48
was
also
announced
venue
principal.
rule
48
provides
that
the
attorney
general
may,
by
leave
of
court,
file
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment.
prior
to
this
rule,
the
attorney
general
could,
at
any
time
prior
to
trial,
dismiss
an
indictment
without
leave
of
court.
this
rule,
the
provision
in
this
rule,
requiring
leave
of
court
or
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
was
inserted
by
this
court,
the
advisory
committee's
recommendation
left
that
out.
in
other
words,
the
dismissal
was
to
be
solely
the
prerogative
of
the
united
states
attorney.
the
requirement
that
leave
of
court
be
obtained
was
inserted
by
this
court.
it
is
our
position
that
rule
48
(a)
requiring
leave
of
court
was
intended
to
require
that
the
district
court,
when
the
united
states
attorney
file
a
motion
for
leave
to
dismiss,
that
the
district
court
would
then
look
at
the
problem
presented
and
would
exercise
real
and
not
mechanical
discretion
so
to
speak.
in
other
words,
that
he
would
make
a
judgment
on
the
facts
and
on
the
law.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
in
this
case,
the
district
judge
erred
in
permitting
dismissal
for
the
purposes
that
were
clear
here
for
the
reasons
that
were
clear
in
this
case.
and
let
me
state
it
this
way.
looking
at
rule
48,
looking
at
rule
21,
the
issue
in
this
case
as
we
conceive
it
is
the
following.
should
the
district
courts
give
leave
to
dismiss
an
indictment
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
united
states
attorney
to
make
a
second
choice
of
forum
in
which
to
prosecute
for
an
identical
offense
because
the
united
states
attorney
is
wholly
displeased
with
the
forum
provided
in
a
transfer
order
and
because
the
united
states
attorney
wishes
to
negate
that
transfer
order
duly
entered
on
evidence
and
as
to
context,
that
i
take
it
is
the
issue
in
this
case.
i
used
the
word
--
i
carefully
used
the
word
“negate
the
order”,
that
is
what
the
government
says
on
page
72,
i
think,
it
is
of
the
--
of
its
brief,
was
the
purpose
in
this
case
for
dismissing
the
first
indictment.
we
have
used
the
less
kindly
but
i
believe
accurate
word
of
circumvention
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
we
do
both,
mr.
justice
harlan.
it's
a
little
difficult
to
know
from
what
judge
kennerly
said,
just
exactly
how
it
appeared
to
him.
he
said
that
in
24
years
on
the
bench,
i
have
never
refused
the
--
a
--
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
attorney
to
dismiss
the
case.
he
said,
“i've
done
that
both
before
and
since.
the
rules
--
the
rules
seem
to
indicate
that
i
have
some
discretion
here
and
if
and
to
the
extent
that
i
have
a
discretion,
i'm
going
to
exercise
it
to
dismiss
here
because”
he
said,
and
this
is
important,
he
said,
“because
the
defendant
has
not
shown
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
dismissed.”
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
an
improper
standard
in
the
context
of
this
case.
justice
abe
fortas
precisely,
mr.
justice,
and
i'd
like
to
make
that
perfectly
clear
since
it
has
been
the
subject
of
a
good
deal
of
discussion
here.
let
us
assume
that
justice
--
that
judge
kennerly
had
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
exercising
his
discretion.
let's
assume
that.
if
he
had
exercised
his
discretion
to
permit
dismissal
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
was
error.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
yes
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
our
position.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
based
on
21
(a)
and
(c).
and
we
rely
heavily
on
21
(c),
mr.
justice
reed.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
correct,
your
honor.
justice
abe
fortas
21
(c)
says
that
after
a
transfer
order
has
entered,
the
prosecution
shall
continue
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
transferee
district.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
your
honor.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
--
that's
our
position.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
our
position.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
--
there's
no
--
there
are
no
cases
on
that
that
i've
been
able
to
find
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
the
--
there
had
been
a
--
a
litigation
of
the
district
to
which
the
case
was
to
be
removed.
and
if
there
had
been
a
finding
after
the
issue
was
litigated,
i
think,
the
defendant
would
be
bound.
i
think,
in
other
words,
that
would
be
res
judicata
of
the
place
to
which
the
case
should
be
removed
but
i
can't
be
positive
about
that.
justice
abe
fortas
i
have
trouble
with
the
word
but
i
--
i
agree,
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
standing
alone
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
could
not
be
set
aside.
justice
abe
fortas
standing
alone,
the
indictment
in
the
western
district
was
--
could
not
be
challenged.
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
it
wouldn't
have
that
power,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
but
let
me
see
if
i
can
be
very
clear
about
it
because
i
have
some
views
about
it.
justice
abe
fortas
let
us
assume
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
let
us
assume
the
facts
in
this
case
just
as
they
are,
that
is
to
say
an
indictment
brought
in
corpus
christi
division
of
the
southern
district,
transfer
after
hearing
to
laredo
in
the
southern
district.
the
government
thereafter
indicts
in
austin
in
the
western
district
but
does
not
move
to
dismiss
the
first
indictment
in
the
southern
district.
on
the
contrary,
the
government
merely
goes
down
to
judge
rice
in
the
austin
court
in
the
western
district
and
says,
“let's
go
to
trial.”
now,
i
cannot
conceive
of
judge
rice
going
to
trial
on
those
circumstances
and
i
believe
that
that's
the
reason
the
government
moved
for
a
dismissal
because
judge
rice
would
have
said
to
the
government,
“i
am
not
going
to
proceed
whether
it's
a
matter
of
law
or
principle
of
comity.
i
am
not
going
to
proceed
with
the
trial
of
this
second
indictment
for
the
same
offense
in
the
western
district
after
a
transfer
order
has
been
entered
by
my
brother,
judge
kennerly,
in
the
southern
district
fixing
the
place
of
trial,
subject
to
21
(c)
which
says
that
the
prosecution
shall
continue
in
the
transferee
forum.”
now,
i've
asked
myself
the
question
why
didn't
the
government
do
that.
why
did
they
go
to
the
trouble
and
get
themselves
involved
in
a
difficulty
of
moving
to
dismiss
this
first
indictment
in
laredo.
and
the
answer,
which
is,
of
course,
must
be
speculation
on
my
part
because
i
don't
know
what
the
government's
reasons
are,
the
answer
is
that
they
were
afraid
and
i
think
properly
so
or
with
reason
not
properly
but
with
reasons
that
judge
rice
would
not
have
permitted
them
to
go
trial
while
the
first
indictment
was
outstanding
subject
to
a
transfer
order.
justice
abe
fortas
your
honor,
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
they
might
in
another
case,
your
honor.
my
--
my
statement
that
it's
inconceivable
was
intended
to
be
limited
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
the
facts
of
this
case
would,
i
believe,
have
persuaded
--
might
have
persuaded
judge
rice
and
certainly
it
would
persuade
me,
that
the
purpose
of
the
government
in
going
to
austin
and
filing
the
second
indictment
was
solely
and
entirely
to
circumvent
the
order
entered
transferring
the
case,
the
first
indictment
to
laredo.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
justice
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
justice,
let
me
point
out
to
you
that
this
is,
again,
that
this
is
the
first
case
that
in
24
years,
first
income
tax
evasion
case,
that
in
24
years
had
been
brought
in
any
forum
in
the
state
--
in
the
state
--
in
this
part
of
texas
except
austin.
has
my
time
expired?
no.
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
spend
a
moment
on
this
question
of
appealability.
we
have
tried
to
brief
that
and
analyze
the
relevant
decisions
of
this
court
as
careful
as
we
could
in
our
--
particularly
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
5
to
13
and
particularly
pages
8
to
10.
i
do
not
accept
the
government's
occuring
tender
that
the
norwood
case
or
another
--
a
decision
of
the
third
circuit
that
they
cite,
are
helpful
which
are
discretionary
appeals
of
something
of
the
sort.
we
believe
that
the
appealability
of
this
case
is
soundly
based
on
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
the
order
that
was
in
it
under
48
(a)
terminated
the
prosecution
in
the
first
indictment.
it
was
an
order
of
dismissal.
i
believe
that
the
only
consideration
here
that
--
that
requires
any
attention
is
the
question
of
agreement.
we
say
that
agreement
existed
here
to
the
petitioner.
this
indictment
was
dismissed
as
the
reasons
for
a
dismissal
show
only
because
the
government
obtained
another
indictment.
the
power
of
the
united
states
attorney,
his
authorization,
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
first
indictment
was
expressly
limited
to
and
conditioned
on
is
being
able
to
get
a
second
indictment.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
sufficiently
establishes
our
agreement.
we
fought
for
an
order
of
transfer.
we
obtained
an
order
of
transfer.
the
government
obtained
another
indictment
solely
to
deprive
us
of
the
benefits
of
that
order
of
transfer.
and
we
think
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
the
nature
of
the
--
what?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
first
place,
we
obtained
an
order
transferring
the
indictment
from
--
away
from
a
forum
which
was
prejudiced
to
us,
your
honor.
and
the
second
place
under
rule
21
(c),
we
had
a
right
as
we
conceive
it
to
have
the
prosecution
continue
in
that
venue.
now,
if
you're
asking
me
your
honor
whether
laredo
is
more
favorable
to
petitioner
here
because
of
factors
with
which
i'm
not
familiar,
then
austin
would
be,
i
can't
answer
that.
you
always
have
that
question
on
a
transfer
here.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
judge
here
found
contrary,
i
believe,
some
of
the
things
that
have
been
said
today,
number
one,
on
page
18
of
the
record,
that
the
government
when
it
presented
its
opposition
of
the
motion
for
transfer
did
not,
when
the
case
was
first
submitted,
claimed
that
it
could
not
obtain
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
at
the
laredo
division.
and
then
further
down,
later
in
its
brief,
it
modified
such
claim
even
a
claim
of
severe
handicap
and
said
merely
that
it
might
be
under
a
handicap.
and
then
judge
kennerly
found,
as
shown
on
page
19
of
the
record,
that
the
--
“i
do
not
think
that
the
evidence
shows
that
the
government
either
will
or
might
be
under
a
severe
handicap
in
the
prosecution
of
this
case
as
claimed.
i
find
to
the
contrary,”
said
the
trial
judge.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
as
i've
already
mentioned
is
that
giving
the
entire
trial
on
the
question
of
transfer,
the
government
never
once
suggested
a
transfer
to
austin.
they
brought
this
case.
they
brought
their
second
indictment
later
in
austin,
specifically
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
effect
as
their
brief
and
--
admits
to
negate
the
order
of
transfer
duly
entered
by
the
court
after
hearing
and
the
taking
of
evidence.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
your
honor.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
opinion
appears
to
the
--
you're
talking
about
his
opinion
on
dismissal.
justice
abe
fortas
page
18
was
his
order
on
the
motion
for
transfer.
justice
abe
fortas
that
--
oh,
the
date
of
that
--
when
was
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
april
27th.
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
in
connection
with
the
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
as
i
read
that
opinion
on
the
motion
to
dismiss,
he
said
that
he
--
he
doubted
whether
the
case
should
be
tried
in
this
district
law
not
because
of
offense
to
either
side.
but
he
said
in
the
administration
of
justice
or
words
to
that
effect
and
i
believe
that
what
he
had
in
mind
as
i
read
this,
your
honor,
what
he
had
in
mind
was
that
the
case
down
there
would
be
attended
by
a
great
deal
of
publicity.
if
he
had
something
more
than
that
in
mind,
i
don't
think
the
opinion
says
it.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
the
question
is
whether
it
has
a
relationship
to
the
claim
of
unfairness
to
the
government
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
which
is
what
mr.
thoron
was
talking
about.
justice
abe
fortas
the
--
his
ruling
was
based
upon
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
no,
there
was
no
motion
of
transfer
to
the
western
district.
the
petitioner
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
petitioner
made
it
very
clear
that
the
petitioner
wanted
it
to
transfer
it
to
laredo.
and
judge
kennerly
concluded
that
he
--
he
didn't
have
power
to
transfer
it
to
anywhere
except
laredo.
the
government
had
indicated
other
possibilities
in
the
southern
district
such
as
houston
(inaudible)
justice
abe
fortas
never.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
judge
kennerly
said
that
he
couldn't
transfer
it
anywhere
except
to
laredo
because
he
apparently
thought
that
the
petitioner's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
petitioner's
indication
of
the
place
to
which
the
case
should
be
transferred
was
binding
on
it.
i
think
that's
what
he
thought,
your
honor.
