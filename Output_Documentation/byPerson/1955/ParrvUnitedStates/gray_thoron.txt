mr.
gray
thoron
may
it
please
the
court.
one
key
fact
we
submit
has
not
been
called
to
your
honors
attention.
no
mention
of
this
fact
has
been
made
in
petitioner's
brief.
no
mention
of
this
fact
has
been
made
in
petitioner's
reply
brief
even
though
the
government's
brief
puts
highlights
to
this
fact
by
putting
it
in
the
headings
of
the
argument.
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
page
78
of
the
record,
that
is
judge
kennerly's
opinion
in
which
he
granted
the
motion,
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
of
southern
district.
halfway
down
the
page,
on
page
78,
he
states,
he
makes
reference
to
the
order
which
he
entered
granting
the
change
of
venue
from
corpus
christi
to
laredo.
and
he
makes
this
statement,
this
is
the
third
paragraph
on
that
page,
"in
reaching
that
conclusion,
or
rather
in
examining
the
record,
i
reach
this
further
conclusion
that
i
gravely
doubted
whether
in
the
administration
of
justice,
generally,
the
case
should
be
tried
in
this
district
at
all.
i
reach
this
conclusion
not
as
favoring,
either
the
government
or
the
defendant,
but
more
from
the
standpoint
of
a
judge
who
is
charged
with
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
district."
he
goes
on
to
state
that
when
he
came
to
examine
the
law,
he
was,
of
the
view,
he
was
without
power
to
transfer
the
case
outside
of
the
southern
district
of
texas,
because
petitioner
on
this
court,
the
defendant
below,
stated
explicitly,
and
that
is
on
page
17
of
the
record,
"we
wish
to
be
clearly
understood
that
if
--
if
the
case
is
not
to
be
transferred
to
laredo,
we
prefer
that
it
remained
in
corpus
christi."
that
key
finding
that
the
interest
of
justice
would
be
best
served
by
having
the
case
tried
outside
the
southern
district.
we
believe
it
puts
a
very
different
light
on
what
happened
here.
that
is
really
the
key
finding
and
no
mention
is
made
of
it
in
either
the
brief
or
the
reply
brief
which
the
petitioner
has
find.
we
assume
that
petitioner
considers
this
fact
immaterial
to
the
--
to
his
potential,
to
his
position.
but
we
do
not
see
how
this
case
can
be
consideredother
than
in
connection
with
this
particular
fact-finding.
now,
what
is
this
fact-finding
based
on
that
it
was
in
the
best
interest?
we
can
go
on,
on
page
78
and
79
of
the
record.
he
said,
"if
i
had
authority,
i
would
have
sent
the
case
elsewhere."
mr.
looney
called
that
to
your
honors
attention,
to
send
it
to
some
of
those
places
as
far
removed
from
the
scene
of
the
trouble
as
i
could
or
as
i
could
find.
this
is
at
the
top
of
page
79
of
the
record,
"i
would
have
done
that,
not
as
a
favor
either
to
the
defendant
or
the
government,
but
because
i
feel
that
justice
in
the
case
would
be
best
administered
by
transferring
the
case
to
one
of
these
places."
now,
in
evaluating,
a
lot
of
reference
has
been
made
to
the
extent
to
which
the
cards
relayed
on
the
table,
i
think
the
opposition
concedes
that
the
--
know
that
--
but
all
the
facts
were
before
the
court,
the
government
filed
the
assistant
attorney
general
holland's
telegram
with
its
motion.
it
filed
written
reasons
for
its
motion
to
dismiss
set
forth
on
pages
22
to
27
of
the
record.
it
gave
extensive
oral
reasons
at
the
hearing,
which
your
honors
will
find
on
pages
39
to
43
of
the
record,
and
throughout
this,
throughout
the
statement
of
reasons,
it's
made
very
clear
that
the
--
the
government's
thinking
was
highly
collared
by
the
decision
of
the
court
to
transfer
the
motion
--
to
--
to
transfer
the
prosecution
to
laredo,
a
division
in
which
petitioner
was
reputed
to
have
a
very
substantial
degree
of
political
power.
we
have
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
pages
77
to
82,
two
interesting
affidavits
which
were
filed
by
mr.
hayden
head,
a
leading
lawyer
in
corpus
christi,
one
filed
by
petitioner
in
which
mr.
head
said,
“though
i
am
an
opponent,
i
have
engaged
in
political
opposition
to
the
petitioner.
i,
as
a
lawyer,
want
to
be
sure
that
he
has
a
fair
trial".
it
seems
that
the
publicity
which
was
developed
in
corpus
christi
makes
that
a
very
doubtful
whether
a
fair
trial
could
be
held
in
the
corpus
christi
division.
at
the
same
time,
he
provided
the
government
with
an
affidavit
that
for
the
same
reason
--
it's
on
page
81
--
it
is
my
equally
firm
opinion
that
the
united
states
of
america
could
not
obtain
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
if
the
trial
of
the
courts
against
george
b.
parr
were
transferred
to
the
laredo
division
of
this
court.
on
page
82,
the
situation
is
the
converse
in
laredo
of
the
situation
in
the
corpus
christi
division.
there's
a
--
these
affidavits
were
filed
after
the
petitioner
had
made
it
clear
that
he
wanted
transfer
to
laredo
only,
and
if
he
was
content
to
remain
in
corpus
rather
than
transfer
somewhere
else.
we
call
attention
to
the
government's
position
laying
all
its
cards
on
the
table,
page
124
of
the
printed
record.
this
was
the
government's
reply
to
petitioner's
application
for
change
of
venue,
in
which
on
page
124,
the
reply
analyzes
the
basis
of
the
prejudice
which
--
on
which
petitioner
was
claiming
the
right
to
transfer,
the
prejudice
being
alleged
to
arise
principle.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
government
dismissed
this
case
because
they
felt
that
the
prosecution
should
better
proceed
in
the
western
district
of
texas
or
anywhere
other
than
in
the
laredo
division.
that
is
correct.
we've
stated
it
before
the
--
judge
kennerly.
we
stated
it
in
every
brief
that
we
filed.
that
is
our
--
that's
--
that
was
a
motivating
factor
that
caused
the
government
to
reevaluate
their
position.
mr.
gray
thoron
that
was
the
government's
feeling.
now,
judge
kennerly
did
say
on
page
19
of
the
record.
that
was
in
his
opinion
when
he
transferred
the
--
the
case
to
laredo,
"i
do
not
think
that
the
evidence
shows
that
the
government
either
will
or
might
be
under
a
severe
handicap
in
the
prosecution
of
this
case
as
claimed.
i
find
to
the
contrary,
although,
such
lawyers
as
mr.
hayden
head
whom
i
have
cited,
mr.
(inaudible),
a
leading
trial
lawyer
in
corpus
christi
who
has
tried
cases
all
over
the
southern
district,
made
similar
affidavits."
i
think
on
balance,
if
there
was
only
a
choice
between
two
districts,
as
judge
kennerly
thought,
that
in
fairness
to
defendants,
should
perhaps
if
there's
any
doubt,
the
advantage
should
be
given
to
the
defendant.
but
the
position
the
government
took,
as
i
was
calling
to
your
honors
attention
on
page
124,
we
do
not
oppose
transfer
to
secure
a
fair
trial.
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
124,
a
transfer
to
secure
a
fair
trial
the
government
does
not
oppose
and
suggested
this
court
should
be
transferred
to
houston,
galveston
or
some
point
outside
the
southern
district
where
according
to
defendant's
own
facts
and
theory,
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
may
be
held.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
mr.
gray
thoron
they
--
mr.
gray
thoron
the
law,
as
we
understand
it,
the
law
as
we
cite
it
on
page
68
of
our
brief,
pages
68
and
69,
where
we
quote
the
advisory
committee
to
the
--
for
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
note
on
rule
21,
it
was
stated
by
the
advisory
committee
by
making
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue,
however,
the
defendant
waives
the
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
in
the
district
in
which
the
crime
is
alleged
to
have
occurred.
now,
that
must
be
solved
because
all
you
would
have
to
do
in
order
to
--
all
the
defendant
would
have
to
do
in
order
to
pick
a
--
a
very
favorable
place
for
trial,
it's
relatively
easy
to,
in
any
crime,
which
gives
rise
to
a
lot
of
emotions,
to
establish
a
probability
of
prejudice
where
a
lot
of
publicity
is
given
to
the
crime.
it
would
invite
shopping,
venue
shopping
by
defendants.
it's
--
it's
known
that
certain
judges
have
very
disparate
views
of
what
a
proper
sentence
within
legal
limits
says
on
a
particular
type
of
offense
to
suggest
an
invitation
to
a
defendant
to
--
if
he
can
establish
a
real
question
that
he
might
get
a
fair
trial,
that
he
might
be
unable
to
get
a
fairly
chosen
jury
in
a
particular
district,
choose
a
district
in
which
a
judge
had
a
reputation
for
being
a
relatively
easier
sentencer
than
in
some
other
districts.
you
have
different
views
on
--
in
different
parts
of
the
country
on
the
seriousness
of
particular
crimes.
in
my
own
state
of
texas,
the
crimes
involving
where
there
has
been
a
fight
over
a
lady
and
a
killing
results,
the
jury
is
a
notoriously
very
lenient,
and
the
prosecution
for
--
though
i
don't
see
a
federal
offense
there,
a
prosecution
for
that
in
one
district
might
be
very
dishonorable
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view
if
he
could
select
his
district.
in
other
words,
we
don't
believe
that
the
rules
over
contemplate
selecting
one
district
and
say,
“we
established
a
possibility
or
probability
of
prejudice.
we
want
to
be
tried
in
one
district
and
this
is
the
only
one,”
and
that's
what
judge
kennerly's
interpretation
of
his
power
was.
mr.
gray
thoron
well,
we
--
if
--
if
by
any
chance
--
if
he
misconceived
his
power
under
rule
48
as
well
as
rule
21,
so
that
the
case
had
to
go
back
and
we're
going
to
very
vigorously
assert
there
was
no
misconception
part
and
this
was
the
only
result
that
could
be
held.
the
case
ought
to
go
back
with
an
instruction
as
to
the
scope
of
its
power
under
rule
21,
as
well,
because
the
--
he
specifically
stated
in
the
record
and
in
his
opinion,
“if
i
have
the
power,
i'd
have
transferred
to
an
area
away
from
the
route
of
the
intense
feeling
about
this
particular
controversial
individual.
mr.
gray
thoron
and
that
--
and
we
stand
very
--
that
was
our
position
that
we
would
be
pleased
with
such
a
transfer
if
in
the
southern
district,
we
will
not
oppose
such
a
transfer
in
the
western
district
to
an
area
away
from
the
south
texas
area
where
it
mystifies
a
controversial
thing.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
the
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
--
that
is
a
possibility.
though,
if
it
comes
on
before
judge
kennerly,
i
--
of
course,
all
these
would
be
subject
to
reexamination.
i
think
he
was
very
strongly
of
the
view
that
the
interest
of
justice
on
--
at
statement
on
page
78
of
the
record
to
which
i
have
already
referred
that
the
best
interest
of
justice
is
served
by
having
the
case
tried
away
from
this
area.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
don't
think
it
will
be
the
same
result.
his
--
mr.
gray
thoron
his
--
his
--
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
the
right
procedural
route
is
extremely
important.
we
--
we
believe
the
result
which
if
--
if
that
above
would
be
a
transfer
to
the
northern
district
on
the
--
or
--
or
to
the
eastern
district
of
texas
or
possibly
to
the
eastern
most
divisions
of
the
southern
district.
mr.
gray
thoron
you
say
--
was
the
brief
on
that
filed
in
the
district
court?
mr.
gray
thoron
i
haven't
seen
the
briefs
that
were
filed.
i
know
that
it
was
vigorously
argued
in
the
--
in
the
record
that
--
that
such
a
--
that
he
had
--
that
you
could
not
have
a
limited
waiver.
that
was
the
government's
basic
objection
to
the
change
of
venue
motion.
they
questioned
whether,
in
fact,
the
claim
of
prejudice
in
the
corpus
christi
division
has
been
made
up,
but
we
have
no
objection
to
a
change
of
venue
to
a
district
that
is
wholly
fair
to
both
sides.
what
we
object
to
is
a
change
to
laredo.
the
--
you
cannot
have
to
select,
a
defendant
cannot
select
the
one
district
to
which
he
is
to
have
a
trial
if
he
makes
out
a
case
justifying
transfer.
mr.
gray
thoron
i'm
not
sure
that
i
quite
follow
your
honor's
question.
mr.
gray
thoron
that
was
on
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
--
of
course,
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
at
that
time,
but
i
think
from
reading
the
--
the
files
on
the
the
matter,
it's
obvious
that
the
government
was
--
couldn't
conceive
that
--
that
transfer
would
be
made
to
laredo.
they
felt
it
can
be
transferred
to
any
district
which
would
be
fair
to
both
sides,
and
this
particular
--
this
particular
development
was
not
anticipated.
and
not
being
anticipated,
the
government
makes
no
secret
of
the
fact,
but
they
felt
this
was
the
only
way
they
could
meet
it,
feeling
no
appealable
order
had
been
entered
from
a
motion
for
a
change
of
--
of
venue,
which
they
felt
was
improperly
decided
and
decided
on
the
basis
of
an
improper
understanding
of
the
law.
the
judge
said,
“if
i
have
the
power,
i
would
have
transferred
it
away
from
the
southern
district.
i
don't
have
the
power
therefore,
i
transferred
it
to
laredo.”
and
that
of
course
was
a
clear
error.
but
in
a
number
of
situations
in
criminal
cases,
the
government
has
no
right
to
appeal
and
the
--
the
government
could
not
appeal
from
an
acquittal.
but
this
was
the
only
--
the
government
has
a
broad
area
in
which
they
think
that
a
fair
trial
can
be
held.
it's
just
in
this
--
this
--
the
--
the
peculiarities
of
this
particular
case
as
brought
out
in
the
affidavits,
we
have
filed
as
we
called
to
the
court's
attention
in
a
footnote
on
pages
--
i
thought
it's
about
page
12
or
13
--
i'm
in
page
into
what
we
filed
the
--
the
affidavits
which
the
government
filed
with
judge
kennerly.
there
are
approximately
100
of
them.
we
filed
certified
photostats
of
those
affidavits.
they
are
part
of
the
record
which
judge
kennerly
had
when
he
ended
his
order.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
appealability
to
us
presents
a
very
serious
question,
although,
as
we
state
in
the
--
in
our
brief,
we
would
prefer
--
the
government
would
prefer
in
this
case
since
the
question
has
been
raised
to
have
a
decision
on
the
merits.
we
don't
--
we
strenuously
urge
the
question
of
appealability
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
looked
to
us
as
if
this
move
was
one
that
would
result
in
substantial
delay
of
bringing
the
case
to
trial.
but
now
that
we
are
here
before
the
court,
we
would
prefer
a
decision
on
the
merits.
we
have
--
even
though
we
doubt
very
much
that
the
case
is
promptly
appealable,
we
have
one
authority
which
we
have
discovered
since
we
filed
our
brief
which
would
justify
the
court
deciding
the
case
on
the
merits
where
we
think
we're
on
very
solid
ground.
we're
now
reaching
the
more
difficult
question
of
appealability,
and
that
is
the
case,
last
term
of
norwood
against
kirkpatrick
in
which
mr.
justice
minton
wrote
for
a
majority
of
this
court,
the
case
involving
a
difficult
question
of
the
interpretation
–-

gray
thoron
the
--
349
u.s.,

of
u.s.of
page

norwood
against
kirkpatrick.
in
that
case,
the
question
before
the
court
on
the
merits
was
whether
a
motion
to
transfer
a
civil
action
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
under
section
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code
had
been
properly
granted.
the
district
judge
in
that
case
had
said,
“in
the
--
in
my
circuit,
the
court
has
interpreted
the
section
1404
(a)
in
a
way
that
requires
me
to
transfer.”
i
believe
this
interpretation
is
erroneous,
and
if
i
could
have
applied
my
own
interpretation,
i
would
deny
the
transfer.
the
order
appeared
to
be
nonappealable,
and
so,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
trying
to
avoid
transfer,
applied
to
the
third
circuit
for
writs
of
mandamus
and
prohibition
against
judge
kirkpatrick
who
entered
the
order.
the
--
this
court,
with
mr.
justice
minton
speaking
for
the
majority,
held
that
the
section
had
been
properly
construed
by
the
third
circuit
and
properly
applied
by
the
district
judge.
in
other
words,
answered
the
question
on
the
merit
and
then
stated,
"since
the
district
judge
properly
construed
his
power,
it
is
unnecessary
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
mandamus
or
prohibition
is
a
proper
remedy."
mr.
justice
clark
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
was
concurred
in
by
two
other
members
of
the
court
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
issue
was
one
which
should
be
settled,
and
he
also
pointed
out
that
every
appellate
court
which
had
passed
on
the
interpretation
of
this
section
had
implicitly
recognized
the
necessity
for
settling
the
issue,
whether
they
had
considered
that
the
matter
was
appealable
or
properly
erasable
by
prerogative
writ.
since
we
have
what
we
think
is
an
easy
question
in
this
case
on
the
merits
and
a
difficult
--
mr.
gray
thoron
what
--
what
was
that,
your
honor?
mr.
gray
thoron
there
was
a
very
difficult
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
use
of
mandamus
or
prohibition.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
also
applied
for
mandamus
and
prohibition,
and
though
we
consider
that's
an
improper
remedy
here,
we
think
there's
an
analogy
if
we
are
entitled
to
it.
we'd
prefer
this,
the
issues
in
the
case.
it's
obviously
going
to
be
raised
in
the
west
--
it
has
already
been
raised
in
the
western
district.
the
district
judge
in
the
western
district
prosecution
has
denied
the
motion
to
transfer
the
western
district
prosecution
to
the
--
to
laredo
or
in
the
alternative,
to
corpus
christi.
on
pages
87
and
88
of
the
record,
petitioner
makes
his
point
position
clear,
that
was
his
petition
for
mandamus
and
prohibition
filed
in
the
firth
circuit.
at
the
bottom
of
page
87,
he
states
that
his
motions
in
the
western
district,
that's
on
the
second
indictment,
to
transfer
to
the
southern
district.
we
based
on
the
contention
that
the
western
district
had
no
jurisdiction
of
the
defendant
to
trial,
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
as
a
spurious
jurisdictional
issue.
no
jurisdiction
of
the
defendant
to
try
him
under
the
indictment
charging
an
offense
identical
with
the
offense
charged
in
the
southern
district.
since
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
venue
of
defendant
for
such
offense
was
in
the
southern
district
of
laredo,
he
goes
on
to
explain
or
he
explains
above
that
this
claim
is
based
on
the
venue
order,
which
having
been
entered
by
judge
kennerly,
he
claims
forecloses,
a
part
in
the
western
district
to
try
the
case.
now,
to
--
if
--
if
our
suggestion,
and
we
advanced
with
hesitation
that
the
technique
of
the
norwood
case
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
was
a
little
startled
when
i
--
perhaps,
i
have
misread
the
opinion,
but
it
--
it
certainly
--
it's
--
it's
as
mr.
justice
clark
stated
in
his
dissent,
this
is
the
kind
of
issue
which
should
be
settled.
and
since
we
have
an
issue
here
that
has
been
briefed
and
argued
and
was
before
this
court,
we
offer
that
as
a
possible
route.
but
if
that
route
is
unavailable,
we
have
great
difficulty
saying
that
a
properly
appealable
question
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
has
been
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
submitted.
mr.
gray
thoron
we
--
and
we
argue
and
i'm
prepared
to
argue
it
here
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
in
this
case,
that's
--
that
the
issues
are
not
properly
appealable,
but
i
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
that
the
government
would
--
if
we're
entitled
to
it,
would
like
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
we're
not
trying
to
avoid
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
we've
been
directed
by
this
court
to
brief
and
argue
the
question
of
appealability.
and
it's
on
--
we
feel
compelled
to
--
to
bring
it
forward
and
our
analysis
indicates
that
the
order
is
not
appealable.
mr.
gray
thoron
it
depends
on
the
nature.
mr.
gray
thoron
your
honor,
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
petitioner's
claim
which
we
have
a
hard
time
exactly
tying
him
down
to
it.
certainly,
in
the
--
in
the
western
district
and
in
his
argument
to
which
i
just
referred,
which
he
presented
to
the
fifth
circuit
in
his
petition
for
mandamus
and
prohibition,
he
took
the
position
that
judge
kennerly's
order,
transferring
the
case
to
laredo,
gave
him
a
vested
right
not
to
be
tried
anywhere,
except
in
laredo.
now,
if
that
is
true,
if
that's
sound
and
we
can't
see
how
it's
possibly
sound,
but
if
it
is
sound,
then
the
southern
--
the
western
district's
judges'
refusal
to
sustain
that
contention
is
just
like
a
refusal
to
--
to
sustain
a
claim
of
immunity
to
--
from
prosecution
or
a
claim
of
a
defense
of
double
jeopardy,
or
--
or
any
jurisdictional
defense
involved.
it's
--
it's
overruled.
the
case
goes
to
trial.
an
appeal
is
taken,
and
one
of
the
points
--
and
there's
a
conviction,
the
appeal
was
--
was
taken.
one
of
the
points
on
the
appeal
is
there
was
error
in
overruling
the
motion
to
dismiss.
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
western
district
indictment.
an
error
in
overruling
the
motion
to
--
it's
a
transfer.
if
it's
a
vested
right,
then
it
can
be
reviewed
on
appeal.
now
--
mr.
gray
thoron
we
--
we
--
mr.
gray
thoron
we
--
we
thought
the
case
was
much
harder.
the
government's
--
mr.
gray
thoron
well
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
think
--
i
think
i
have
to
admit
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
the
--
the
--
that
the
basis
was
a
feeling
that
the
trial
would
not
be
fair.
we
certainly
filed
a
lot
of
affidavits
to
that
effect.
mr.
gray
thoron
there
--
there
are
--
there
are
several
--
on
the
statement
of
reasons,
written
statement
of
reasons,
pages
22
to
26
--
mr.
gray
thoron
perhaps
i
can
do
better
in
pointing
out
the
language
on
pages
39
and
42.
i
would
have
said
it
was
implicit
in
that
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
doubt
if
it
was
in
--
in
--
in
those
words,
and
perhaps
it
should
have
been,
but
it's
certainly
implicit
on
our
statement
in
pages
40
and
41
where
--
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
it
had
been
an
issue
which
--
which
judge
kennerly
had
apparently
decided
against
us
and
in
the
southern
district
whether
we
should
have
used
a
little
different
litigations
strategy,
that's
a
--
from
hindsight,
maybe
we
should
have.
mr.
gray
thoron
well,
i
--
i
have
just
said
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
that
--
that
they
just
placed
the
cards
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
on
the
table
on
--
on
pages
40
and
41.
mr.
gray
thoron
and
he
says
that
this
is
the
oral
presentation
by
the
united
states
attorney,
before
judge
kennerly,
in
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
he
starts
on
page
40
--
page
39
when
they
--
with
this
statement.
now,
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court,
and
i
think
the
attorney
general
owes
a
duty
to
the
court
to
point
out
the
reasons
why
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
to
ask
leave
of
the
court
to
dismiss
in
the
southern
district.
among
these
reasons
are
these,
the
first
reason,
i
think,
is
very
pertinent
or
was
had
to
do
with
the
change
of
personnel
in
the
western
district,
but
that
explains
why
the
indictment
was
first
brought
in
the
southern
district.
mr.
gray
thoron
but
the
second
and
third
reasons,
which
i'm
particularly
pointing
out,
your
honor.
mr.
gray
thoron
what
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
gray
thoron
the
united
states
attorney's
of
--
mr.
gray
thoron
pages
40
and
41
of
the
record,
and
the
last
paragraph
on
page
40.
a
second
thing
of
importance
in
the
attorney
general's
consideration
has
been
the
change
in
the
case
from
trial
at
corpus
christi
to
laredo.
and
i
pointed
out
some
reasons
here
as
to
why
they
thought
the
defendant
would
be
satisfied
with
the
choice
of
trial
in
his
own
district.
he
points
out
the
--
on
the
middle
of
page
41,
"there's
a
third
thing
that
affects
not
only
the
composition
of
the
jury
panel,
but
it's
also
the
problem
of
witnesses
in
this
case."
without
revealing
in
great
detail
the
nature
of
the
government's
case,
he
points
out
it
were
based
on
testimony
of
witnesses
who
are
residents,
long
time
acquaintances
and
friends
of
the
defendant.
we
feel
that
the
trial
in
this
case,
towards
the
bottom
of
page
41
in
laredo,
"close
to
the
defendant's
seat
of
political
power
and
with
his
associations
there,
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
eliciting
truth
from
the
witnesses
the
government
will
be
forced
to
bring
in
order
to
establish
this
case."
three
lines
further
down,
"we
feel
that
these
witnesses
will
testify
more
freely,
more
honestly,
more
frankly,
more
than
the
truth
of
the
matters,
which
should
be
proved
in
this
case,
the
further
removed
they
are
from
the
district
in
which
laredo
is
located."
that's
--
that's
a
--
it
waws
a
pretty
strong
statement
it
seemed
to
me
on
the
fourth
reason
of
newspaper
publicity.
mr.
gray
thoron
corpus
christi
is
about
150
miles
from
laredo.
mr.
gray
thoron
160
miles
--
mr.
gray
thoron
it's
--
it's
--
there
--
they're
certainly
is
closer
to
the
--
mr.
gray
thoron
border,
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
right.
well,
the
--
actually,
there
are
parts
of
the
southern
district
of
texas
which
are
in
that
area,
and
houston
and
galveston
in
--
in
parts
of
the
western
district
which
were
in
that
area,
del
rio
division,
and
houston
and
galveston
which
were
in
the
southern
district
are
not
in
the
--
in
the
border
area.
in
other
words,
i
think
district
was
not
used
as
technical
sense.
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
right.
in
the
geographical
sense,
that
covers
the
whole
real
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
would
--
i
would
interpret
that
as
not
being
coterminous
with
the
judicial
district
as
a
matter
of
--
as
a
matter
of
common
parlance.
again,
i'm
faced
with
a
--
with
a
statement,
which
i
have
to
interpret
just
as
your
honor
does
and
though
i
have
some
familiarity
with
texas
geography,
i
assume
it's
a
geographical
turf.
if
i'm
wrong
on
that,
the
western
district
--
parts
of
the
western
district
should
be
included
to
el
paso,
del
rio,
both
portions.
other
parts
are
--
are
far
away
from
it.
i
think
our
position
is
clear
if
we
didn't
state
it
as
--
as
--
this
is
--
this
is
what
we
stated.
this
is
what
we
stand
and
fall
on.
mr.
gray
thoron
that
--
that
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
is
our
position.
mr.
gray
thoron
we
are
not
evading.
mr.
gray
thoron
we
--
again,
it's
a
matter
--
it's
a
matter
of
--
of
words
and
if
i
use
the
wrong
words
there,
if
we
haven't
told
judge
kennerly,
but
we
feel
that
our
case
has
become
more
difficult
by
your
honor's
ruling,
we
think
we
have
a
choice.
the
rules
appear
to
give
us
a
choice
as
to
where
we
may
bring
the
prosecution.
if
it
hadn't
been
for
your
honor's
ruling
upon
the
venue
of
motion,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
were
urging
if
they
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
in
corpus
christi,
transfer
it
away
from
this
area
and
that
we
didn't
oppose,
and
we
still
don't.
and
this
is
the
reason
why
obviously
this
--
this
motion
was
made
and
judge
kennerly
understood
it
as
such.
and
i
think
there's
--
i
think
there's
--
there's
no
doubt
that
the
--
the
government
felt
their
case
is
heard
by
transfer
to
laredo.
mr.
gray
thoron
it
was
--
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
doing
what
we
thought
the
judge
wanted
to
do
but
felt
--
it
was
--
it
was
to
get
around
the
--
the
ruling,
no
doubt
about
it.
if
we
are
not
entitled
to
that,
there's
been
error
in
this
case.
i
think
there's
--
there's
no
question
that
that
was
the
controlling
factor.
you
evaluate
the
strength
of
your
case
as
matters
develop,
and
certainly,
the
effect
of
this
thing
is
to
have
trial
away
from
laredo.
that
raises
it.
mr.
gray
thoron
which
--
not
--
not
this
brief.
i
--
i
have
the
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
--
i
understood
the
--
the
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
if
--
if
we
had
no
right
to
do
this
avoidance,
if
we
used
it,
if
we
use
the
tax
term
between
evasion
and
avoidance.
certainly,
this
was
to
avoid
the
impact
of
judge
--
judge
kennerly's
order
and
he
understood
that
as
such
as
we
submit
by
a
reading
of
his
opinion.
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
right.
and
--
and
we
think
certainly
those
matters
set
forth
orally
on
pages
39,
40,
41,
42,
and
43
of
the
record.
mr.
gray
thoron
no,
no,
your
honor.
i
won't
make
any
such
--
any
such
claim.
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
questions
on
appealability,
if
i
may,
the
--
if
the
claims
are
--
are
vested
right
to
trial
in
laredo,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
way
in
which
our
petitioner
has
been
injured,
he
may
be
forced
to
go
through
a
trial.
assuming
his
claim
is
--
is
valid,
he
may
be
forced
to
go
through
a
trial
which
would
have
to
be
set
aside.
that
is
a
--
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
time
and
time
again,
one
of
the
risks
which
has
to
be
going
--
going
through
where
this
policy
against
piecemeal
appeals,
if
it's
to
be
carried
out,
that's
a
legislatively
set
policy.
that
was
what
this
court
held
in
217th
united
states
in
the
heike
case
where
there
was
a
claim
of
immunity
from
prosecution.
we
tried
to
take
an
immediate
appeal
and
get
a
review
on
that
but
it
was
denied.
this
court,
by
a
unanimous
decision
without
passing
on
the
merits
said,
"if
there's
any
validity
in
this
claim,
it
will
have
to
be
raised
on
--
on
appeal
from
conviction."
now
--
mr.
gray
thoron
we
think
that
the
heike
case
is
virtually
indistinguishable
from
the
situation
that
is
here.
mr.
gray
thoron
if
the
nature
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
thoron
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
thoron
that
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
cannot
distinguish
it
from
this
case
if
it
is
a
vested
right.
if
his
contention
is
correct
that
he
had
a
vested
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
--
that
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
thoron
if
it
applied,
it's
a
--
it's
a
vested
right.
mr.
gray
thoron
if
--
if
it
didn't
apply,
the
district
judge
held
it
didn't
apply.
mr.
gray
thoron
petitioner's
argument,
as
i
understand
it
in
the
courts
below
and
in
this
court,
is
one
facet
of
his
argument
is
that
the
court
lack
the
power
to
continue
the
--
to
hear
the
case
in
the
western
district.
any
conviction
of
the
western
district
would
be
invalid.
mr.
gray
thoron
that
was
true
on
the
heike
case.
that
is
true
in
petitioner's
argument
here.
that's
one
facet
of
his
argument.
if
that
is
true,
then
the
normal
appeal,
the
--
the
normal
way
to
raise
it
is
by
appeal
following
conviction
and
not
by
appeal
from
the
order
refusing
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
the
order
refusing
to
sustain
the
plea
in
bar
in
the
heike
case
is
similar
to
the
order
refusing
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
that's
why
i
find
the
case
as
indistinguishable
on
that
facet
of
petitioner's
case.
mr.
gray
thoron
petitioner
here
is
appealing
from
an
order
dismissing
an
indictment
which
he
wanted
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
terminated
that
proceeding
and
there
we
have
a
very
difficult
problem
of
agreement.
they
--
based
on
the
merits,
it
did
not
terminate
it
on
the
merits,
but
--
mr.
gray
thoron
it
terminated
that
prosecution
and
--
and
petitioner's
point
is,
“i
have
a
right
to
have
this
prosecution
continued.”
mr.
gray
thoron
because
i
–
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
there
is
no
grievance
in
that
case.
it
is
like
any
order
in
which
a
claim
is
made
of
a
--
this
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
this
dismissal
should
be
with
prejudice.
mr.
gray
thoron
this
just
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
--
i
think
i
missed
part
of
your
--
your
honor's
--
mr.
gray
thoron
he
--
he
has
a
claim
that
if
i
am
to
be
tried
at
all
-–
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
right.
he
says,
"if
i
am
to
be
tried
at
all,
i
am
to
be
tried
under
this
indictment
in
this
district."
that's
as
i
understand
is
--
mr.
gray
thoron
in
the
--
in
this
district
and
division.
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
his
claim,
and
we
say
he
is
not
to
be
tried
at
all
under
that
indictment.
now,
he
says,
“if
i'm
not
to
be
tried
at
all
under
that
indictment,
i
can't
be
tried
under
the
western
district
indictment.
of
course,
we
can't
see
any
merit
in
this
contention.
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
--
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
the
western
district
indictment
is
here
in
one
sense.
the
petitioner
has
tried
to
bring
everything
up
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
--
that
is
right,
but
petitioner
has
applied
to
this
court
for
a
writ
of
prohibition
to
prohibit
further
proceedings
in
the
western
district,
or
the
alternative
mandamus
to
order
the
transfer
of
the
western
district
indictment
to
the
southern
district.
so,
that
is
number
302
miscellaneous
which
is
pending
before
this
court.
so,
in
one
sense,
the
western
district
indictment
is
there.
now,
as
i
understood,
the
--
the
question
that
was
posed
was,
if
we
don't
have
review
here,
do
we
foreclose
all
possibility
of
review?
and
in
answer
to
that
question,
i
was
trying
to
make
out
that
if
there
is
a
conviction
in
the
western
district,
if
this
contention
is
valid
of
a
vested
right
to
be
tried
in
laredo,
then
there
would
have
to
be
a
reversal
of
any
conviction
in
the
western
district.
so,
there
could
be
a
review
of
that
question,
following
a
subsequent
conviction,
not
in
this
case,
but
in
a
subsequent
case.
now,
we
think
that
petitioner
is
also
claiming,
"maybe
i
haven't
got
a
vested
right,
but
as
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
discretion,
i
should
have
a
--
i
should
have
a
privilege
of
being
tried
in
laredo
and
not
in
austin
or
not
elsewhere
because
of
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case."
that,
i
think,
is
an
alternative
contention
of
petitions
and
which
he
say,
“if
i
was
tried
and
convicted
in
--
in
austin,
in
the
western
district,
then
my
claim
is
not
such
a
claim
that
it
will
be
a
reversible
error
in
the
western
district
claim
--
case.”
only
if
his
claim
is
in
those
terms
might
you
say
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
review
in
some
other
proceeding.
now,
i
--
i
think
that
one
of
the
justices
asked
me
that
question
and
i
think
the
answer
to
some
extent
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
claim.
if
it's
this
sort
of
indeterminate
claim
of
a
privilege,
then
i
think
that
petitioner
makes
his
biggest
argument
that
the
rule
of
cohen
against
beneficial
loan
in
which
it
was
cited
and
abide
on
by
both
parties,
its
beneficial
loan
corporation.
that's
in
337
u.s.,
that
under
that
that
would
a
--
an
permit
an
exception
to
te
final
decision
rule.
and
our
difficulty
with
that
is
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
there
was
specifically
this
finding
which
i
have
made
reference
to
before
that
the
interest
of
justice
would
be
best
served
by
trial
away
from
the
southern
district
of
texas.
that
is
one
factor
which
it
seems
to
us,
we
submit,
throws
a
--
is
extremely
important
as
regards
whether
an
--
a
further
exception
should
be
made
to
the
common
rule.
it
seems
to
me
also
a
factor
that
the
government
has
consistently
not
opposed
transfer
to
secure
a
fair
trial,
if
we
can
get
it
and
that
we
did
before
any
ruling
was
made
by
judge
kennerly.
that's
on
page
124
of
the
record,
which
i
called
to
your
honors
attentions,
attention
towards
the
start
of
the
argument.
it's
also
a
fact
to
hear
as
to
whether
the
circumstances
are
--
are
called
for
this
court's
special
review
on
the
merits
that
the
--
the
petitioner
himself
was
so
insistent
upon
trial
in
one
specific
district
in
saying,
as
he
said
that
appears
on
page
17
of
the
record,
"we
wish
to
be
clearly
understood
that
if
a
case
is
not
to
be
transferred
to
laredo,
we
prefer
that
it
remained
in
corpus
christi."
we
have
the
district
judge's
erroneous
conclusion
with
--
to
which
we
have
made
reference
as
judge
kennerly's
erroneous
conclusion
that
his
transfer
of
power
was
limited
by
defendant's
refusal
to
agree
to
transfer
else
--
elsewhere.
and
we
also
have
--
and
this
is
a
fact
if
it
has
not
been
--
been
made
before
--
a
--
the
factor
of
how
much
interference
should
there
be
with
the
attorney
general's
prima
facie
choice
of
where
to
prosecute
and
where
not
to
prosecute
where
there
is
some
choice.
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
our
position
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
gray
thoron
well,
it's
one
of
our
positions
that
we
advanced
in
the
--
in
--
in
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
--
i
am
feeling
wise
out
of
fairness
to
the
petitioner.
mr.
gray
thoron
if
there
are
two
indictments,
we
--
we
should
elect.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
think
that
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
follow
the
final
--
the
--
the
final
step
there,
or
certainly
the
--
the
southern
district
--
the
western
district
conviction
would
be
vitiated.
mr.
gray
thoron
if
--
if
it
is
a
question
which
appellate
court
will
review,
if
the
question
is
just
one
of
an
exercise
of
discretion,
which
an
individual
judge,
one
judge
might
have
felt
one
thing,
another
judge
might
have
felt
another.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
--
mr.
gray
thoron
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
gray
thoron
if
there
is
any
merit
to
that
--
mr.
gray
thoron
--
that
would
--
that
would
be
--
that
would
--
mr.
gray
thoron
yes.
mr.
gray
thoron
the
--
the
point
on
appeal
would
be
that
the
judge
in
the
western
district
committed
error
in
not
dismissing
the
western
district
indictment,
or
that
he
committed
error
in
not
transferring
the
western
district
indictment
to
laredo.
mr.
gray
thoron
and
the
--
mr.
gray
thoron
because
--
mr.
gray
thoron
no,
because
the
order
of
transfer
of
the
southern
district
indictment
vested
in
petitioner,
a
right
to
be
tried
in
laredo.
that's
his
position.
mr.
gray
thoron
not
--
not
directly
reviewed,
but
if
it
gives
--
if
it
--
mr.
gray
thoron
if
it
gives
rise
to
any
rights
at
all,
its
rights
in
the
western
district
case.
mr.
gray
thoron
that's
right
and
--
and
--
mr.
gray
thoron
you
are
appealing
to
something
which
appeals
to
me
very
much.
i'm
not
as
--
as
much
of
a
champion
personally
of
the
final
decision
rule.
mr.
gray
thoron
as
--
as
i
--
as
i
read
this
court's
decision
in
the
cohen
case,
there
must
be
some
peculiar
--
some
--
some
specially
peculiar
circumstances
which
will
call
for
the
--
the
making
of
something
reviewable
where
--
which
normally
would
not
be
and
that's
spelled
out
in
our
brief.
beyond
that,
i
don't
--
we
--
we
welcome
a
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
--
i
can't
conceive
--
concede
in
view
of
the
authorities
that
a
--
that
an
appealable
judgment
has
been
entered,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
more
that
i
can
state
on
what's
in
the
brief
and
what
i've
--
i've
outlined
here
as
to
--
i
think
we
--
we
bring
the
authorities
out
and
the
--
the
court
has
to
--
mr.
gray
thoron
the
issue
on
appealability
is
--
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
the
cohen
case
exceptions
apply
and
to
--
to
orders
affecting
the
place
of
trial
or
to
a
--
to
orders
of
dismissal
where
a
defendant
claims
a
right
not
to
--
not
to
have
the
case
dismissed.
actually,
most
courts
say,
“no
defendant
can
appeal
from
an
order
dismissing
an
indictment
against
him,
because
he's
not
aggrieved,”
and
--
mr.
gray
thoron
and
--
and
he
--
he
wouldn't
be
here.
he
--
he
--
if
he's
going
to
be
tried,
he
insists
on
a
right
to
be
tried
in
laredo.
the
government's
position
is
that
if
he's
going
to
be
tried,
it's
perfectly
proper
to
try
him
in
the
western
district.
it's
proper
to
try
him
anywhere
that
a
fair
trial
can
be
held
by
both
parties.
and
that
the
basic
error,
which
caused
all
these
diffulties
was
judge
kennerly's
error
in
thinking
that
he
could
only
transfer
to
laredo,
but
the
defendant
could
shop
for
a
--
a
specific
venue
when
he
was
able
to
establish
a
degree
of
prejudicism.
since
my
time
has
officially
expired
and
the
elements
on
the
merits
have
been
fairly
well
developed
in
this
discussion
of
the
--
of
the
facts,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
district
court's
order
which
the
district
court
found
was
entered
in
the
interest
of
justice.
that
the
interest
of
justice
justified
this
dismissal
to
do
what
it
felt
it
couldn't
do
otherwise,
that
that
order
should
be
left
understood.
if,
by
any
chance,
this
court
feels
that
there
was
error,
we
suggest
that
this
court
must
send
the
case
back
not
only
for
an
exercise
of
--
proper
exercise
of
discretion,
we
say
it's
very
clear
from
our
brief
that
it
was
exercised,
but
for
a
proper
exercise
of
discretion
as
to
where
the
case
should
be
transferred.
