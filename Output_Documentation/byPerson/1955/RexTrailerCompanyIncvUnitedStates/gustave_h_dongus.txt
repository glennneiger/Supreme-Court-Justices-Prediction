mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
presents
the
question
whether
the
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
in
the
fifth
amendment
bars
the
government's
recovery
from
petitioner
of
the
statutory
sum
of
$2000
provided
in
section
26
(b)
(1)
of
the
surplus
property
act
of
1944
pertaining
surplus
property
by
a
fraud
when
on
the
admitted
facts
the
government
had
no
loss.
the
statute
involved
here
substance
--
in
substance
provides
that
every
person
who
shall
use
or
engage
in
any
fraudulent
trick,
scheme
or
device
for
the
purpose
of
securing
or
obtaining
surplus
property
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
--
shall
pay
to
the
united
states
the
sum
of
$2,000
for
each
such
act
and
double
the
amount
of
any
damage
which
the
united
states
may
have
sustained
by
reason
thereof,
together
with
the
cause
for
them
to
sue.
in
addition,
the
--
i
may
point
out
that
the
statute
under
subsections
2
and
3
provide
two
alternative
remedies
to
the
government;
namely,
that
the
united
states
may
recover,
as
liquidated
damage,
twice
the
consideration
agreed
to
be
paid
or
as
a
further
alternative,
the
government
may
keep
the
property
or
rather
recover
the
property
and
keep
the
consideration
was
--which
has
been
paid.
now,
those
two
alternative
remedies
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
what
is
involved
is
this
flat
sum
of
$2000.
the
facts
alleged
in
the
government's
complaint
and
in
the
petitioner's
answer
on
which
the
case
was
submitted
by
motions
for
summary
judgment
are
briefly
these.
the
government's
complaint
contained
five
separate
counts.
count
one
alleged
that
in
june
1947,
at
tinker
field
in
oklahoma,
petitioner
did
cause
a
named
individual
to
make
a
false
statement
of
a
material
fact
in
writing
to
the
war
assets
administration
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
certain
described
motor
truck.
the
false
statements
were
statements
qualifying
the
persons
--
the
person's
name
in
each
of
the
counts
as
a
veteran
for
priority
right
to
purchase.
counts
two
through
five
are
identical
with
count
one,
as
except,
as
to
the
name
of
the
person
involved
and
the
description
of
the
motor
vehicles.
judgment
was
asked
for
$2000
on
each
count
or
a
total
of
$10,000.
petitioner
in
its
answer
pleaded
that
the
government's
action
was
to
recover
a
statutory
penalty
and
was
not
for
the
collection
of
any
obligation
or
indebtedness
owing
to
the
united
states
or
for
the
recovery
of
any
damage
suffered
by
the
united
states.
and
the
petitioner
had
previously
been
indicted
in
the
district
court
--
federal
district
court
in
oklahoma
in
this
--in
five
counts
on
this
very
same
five
transactions.
and
that
he
had
pleaded
nolo
contendere
in
the
criminal
action.
and
that
the
court
had
imposed
a
total
fine
of
$25,000
and
which
fine
was
paid
by
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
had
then
further
alleged
in
his
answer
that
the
trucks
in
question
were
advertised,
offered
for
sale
by
the
war
assets
administration
at
a
fixed
price.
and
that
under
the
terms
of
the
sale,
certain
government
agencies,
individuals
were
given
the
priority
right
to
purchase.
that
the
federal
agencies
had
a
higher
priority
than
certified
veterans.
and
that
this
petitioner
had
a
nonpriority
right
to
purchase,
as
a
dealer
in
certain
types
of
machinery.
the
answer
further
alleged
that
respondent
was
not
damaged,
as
the
government
was
not
damaged,
did
not
suffer
any
loss
because
of
the
sale
of
the
trucks
and
had
received
the
full
advertised
offering
price
and
if
the
trucks
hadn't
been
sold
to
the
petitioner
or
others,
it
would
have
been
sold
at
the
same
price
to
other
priority
or
nonpriority
purchasers.
and
concluded
was
the
allegation
that
the
complaint
seeks
to
recover
a
further
penalty
in
addition
to
the
criminal
fine
previously
paid
by
petitioner,
thereby,
placing
it
in
double
jeopardy,
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment.
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
pleadings
was
sustained
that
petitioner
was
denied.
and
judgment
was
entered
against
petitioner
in
the
sum
of
$10,000
or
$2000
on
each
of
the
five
counts.
that
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
below
which
held
that
the
provision
in
section
26
(b)
(1)
for
the
payment
of
this
$2000
was
compensatory
and
not
penal
in
nature
and
therefore
petitioner's
defense
of
double
jeopardy
was
no
bar
to
this
action.
now,
the
statute
itself
distinguishes
between
the
sum
of
$2000
and
the
double
damages
which
are
recoverable.
now
as
observed
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
united
states
versus
witherspoon,
reported
in
211
f.2d
which
involved
a
limitation's
question,
the
court
said
there
that
the
exaction
of
the
arbitrary
sum
of
$2000
for
each
offense
of
obtaining
surplus
property
by
fraud
without
regard
to
the
value
of
the
property
is
a
provision
for
a
penalty
and
that
its
purpose
is
to
punish
an
offense
against
the
public
justice.
now,
the
government
in
their
brief
in
this
case
contends
that
this
$2000,
plus
double
damages,
is
a
reasonable
measure
of
a
forseeable
damages
to
the
government.
and
mentions
the
fact
that
surplus
property
included
such
items
as
ships,
war
plants,
port
and
harbor
facilities,
strategic
materials.
but
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale,
it
also
included
such
items
as
desks,
chairs,
filing
cabinets,
typewriters
and
some
items
costing
as
little
as
10
cents.
but
under
the
government's
contention,
it
may
indict
and
punish
a
man
criminally
for
the
fraud,
no
matter
how
picayunish
or
small
the
item
may
be
and
then
later
also
collect
this
$2000
penalty.
the
government
contends
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
united
states,
or
rather,
marcus
v.hess
and
in
317
united
states
and
in
mitchell
versus
united
states
in
303
united
states,
require
they
do
not
compel
the
holding
in
this
case
that
the
statute
is
remedial
to
provide
restitution
for
damage
to
the
government.
and
they
go
on
to
argue
and
now
i
quote
from
page
11
to
12
of
their
brief.
that
once
it
is
decided
that
this
is
a
remedial
action
and
i
quote,
â€œthe
remedy
applies
to
all
cases,
under
the
statute,
irrespective
of
their
individual
facts
or
a
proof
of
actual
damage."
in
other
words,
the
facts
of
the
case
make
no
difference.
that
this
amount
is
recoverable,
the
remedy
inexorably
apply
in
all
cases
within
the
sweep
of
the
statute.
now,
we
submit
that
neither
the
hess
case
or
the
mitchell
case
are
authority
for
this
sweeping
doctrine.
in
the
hess
case,
if
the
court
will
recall,
the
action
was
brought
under
the
false
claims
act
which
provided
that
whoever
shall
commit
certain
frauds
on
the
government
shall
forfeit
and
pay
the
sum
of
$2000.
and
in
addition
the
government
may
recover
double
damages.
the
defendants
in
that
case
were
charged
with
conspiring
by
means
of
certain
fraudulent
collusive
bids
on
certain
government
contracts.
the
defendants,
as
the
petitioner
here,
had
previously
been
indicted,
and
a
criminal
fine
had
been
imposed.
and
they
pleaded
double
jeopardy,
just
as
we
do
or
rather
the
petitioner
does
here.
this
court,
in
holding
that
the
double
jeopardy
provision
was
not
applicable,
pointed
out
that
the
application
of
the
--
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
particular
cases
has
not
been
an
easy
task
for
the
courts,
stating
that
the
subject
had
been
recently
thoroughly
explored
in
helvering
v.mitchell
in
303
united
states.
and
that
the
cases
there
emphasized
the
line
between
several
remedial
actions
brought
primarily
to
protect
the
government
from
financial
loss
and
actions
intended
to
authorize
criminal
punishment
to
vindicate
public
justice.
and
the
court
there
said,
the
question
for
that
and
decision
in
that
case
is
whether
the
statute
imposed
a
criminal
sanction
in
that
case,
however,
as
we
see
it.
the
court
then
said
there's
enough
for
present
purposes
if
we
conclude
that
the
instant
proceedings
are
remedial
and
impose
a
several
sanction
and
went
on
to
say
that
the
key
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
provide
for
restitution
to
the
government.
in
other
words,
the
government
has
to
have
a
loss.
now,
in
this
case,
the
government
has
admitted
that
they
had
no
loss.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
it's
admitted
by
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
you
honor.
we,
in
the
record,
at
page
8,
i
believe
it
is.
yes,
at
page
8
at
the
top,
we
recite
there
in
our
answer
that
by
reason
of
the
facts
above
set
forth,
the
plaintiff
was
not
damaged
--
was
not
damaged
and
did
not
suffer
any
loss
because
of
the
sale
of
the
trucks.
now,
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
those
facts
are
admitted.
so,
they
had
no
loss.
and
that
the
government
had
no
loss
in
this
case.
but
they
say
they're
entitled
to
recover
this
$2000,
although
the
petitioner's
already
have
been
punished
for
the
fraud.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
i
think
it
would
--
your
honor
would
have
had
to
prove
some
damage,
your
honor.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that's
correct.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
no,
your
honor.
that
is
--
that
was
held
in
the
hess
case.
now,
i
wanted
to
point
that
out.
you
see
in
the
hess
case,
there
--
there
was
damage.
and
the
--
and
the
court
sustained
the
provision
for
$2000
plus
the
doubles
damages.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
now,
on
some
of
the
counts,
your
honor.
although
the
point
was
not
touched
on
in
--
in
this
court's
opinion.
on
some
of
the
counts,
the
government
did
not
prove
an
actual
amount
of
damage.
and
--
and
the
decision
of
this
court
sustained
the
holding
of
the
court
below
that
the
$2000
is
recoverable.
but
in
that
case,
the
damages
were
--
and
provoked
from
the
fact
that
there
are
the
--
the
defendants
by
their
collusive
bids
had
gouged
the
government
out
of
some
money.
in
--
in
other
words,
you
have
a
situation
there
where
damages
may
be
hard
to
prove
by
the
very
nature
of
the
collusive
bids.
and
the
government
didn't
admit
in
that
case
as
they
do
here
that
there
was
no
damage.
they
didn't
prove
a
specific
amount
of
damage.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that's
some
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
no,
sir.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
i
don't
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
i
don't
dispute
that
but
i
--
we
do
dispute
the
fact
that
the
government
can't
come
in
and
say
we
can
get
$2000
although
we
have
not
been
damaged
and
we
have
had
no
loss.
and
they
have
admitted
that,
in
this
case.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that's
correct.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that's
correct,
you
honor.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that's
--
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
i
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well
i
think
that
the
--
in
their
--
in
the
government's
brief,
they
admitted
they
had
--
that
they
admit
they
had
no
loss.
they
--
they
do
--
i'm
coming
to
that.
they
do
try
to
sustain
this
on
this
imposition
of
this
penalty
here
by
certain
facts
that
holds
the
record
outside
of
the
record.
now,
i
--
i've
come
to
that
now
as
the
court
below,
i
might
say,
in
its
opinion
said,
that
the
--
that
the
government
was
damaged
in
several
respects.
notwithstanding,
on
the
facts
on
the
record,
as
we
see
it.
the
government
said
they
had
no
damage.
now,
what
does
that
damage
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that's
right.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they've
admitted
that
by
their
motion
for
summary
judging.
now,
the
â€“
the
other
damage
which
they
now
argue
in
this
--
in
their
brief
in
this
case
neither
argued
below
in
which
we
think
its
wholly
outside
the
record
in
this
case,
consisted
of
the
--
of
the
following.
the
--
it
is
said
that
the
motor
vehicles
were
in
short
supply
in
1946
and
1947.
that
was
half
of
termination
of
world
war
2.
and
that
this
surplus
vehicles
that
the
government
wanted
to
sell
these
to
veterans
at
--
at
less
than
market
prices.
now,
there's
no
proof
in
this
case
that
these
vehicles
were
--
were
sold
at
anything
less
than
market
price.
the
government
relies
on
the
--
on
administrative
regulation
that
surplus
property
shall
be
sold
at
the
fair
value
and
that
the
fair
value
shall
not
be
less
than
the
price
offered
to
the
lowest
trade
level.
now,
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
the
price
offered
to
the
lowest
trade
level
could
well
be
more
and
not
less
than
the
higher
price.
and
certainly
there's
--
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that
--
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
it
is
true
that
it's
in
a
form
of
a
--
a
--
of
a
liquidated
damage
provision.
but
as
we
say
--
but
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
there
they
could
apply
--
the
government
could
apply
this
$2000
in
any
case
then,
no
matter
how
small
the
item
is,
even
if
it
would
only
cost
10
cents.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
but
i
think
congress
contemplated,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
very
--
in
the
act
itself
that
there
must
be
--
must
be
damages.
they
say
two
--
they
access
$2000
in
double
damages.
there
--
there
must
be
a
damage,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
penal
feature
was
under
18
united
states
code
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
$10,000
in
five
years
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
--
that's
either
five
or
ten
years,
i
believe,
is
punishable.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well,
the
money
fine
is
to
vindicate
to
public
justice
as
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
i
--
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
--
and
they've
--
to
that
extent,
they've
already
collected
that
amount.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
no,
sir.
we
have
not
submitted
any
in
--
in
our
brief
on
that
point.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
--
and
there's
none
in
the
government
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well,
there's
an
element
of
damage
in
it,
so,
if
the
court
please,
certainly.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
that's
--
there
are
no
--
that
is
admitted
in
this
case.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
i
think
it
--
it
should.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
the
--
the
government
further
said,
there's
an
element
of
damage
here,
that
the
procurement
of
the
trucks
may
have
deprived
some
government
agency
from
obtaining
needed
vehicles.
but
that
--
that
can't
be
true
here
because
the
government
agencies
had
a
higher
priority.
and
all
they
needed
to
do
was
to
exercise
that
priority
to
the
exclusion
of
the
petitioner.
apparently
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
that
case,
the
government
had
a
loss.
they
had
a
tax
loss.
now,
if
in
the
mitchell
case
--
if
there
hadn't
been
any
loss,
there
was
then
nothing
to
base,
on
which
to
base
the
50%
penalty.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
but
it
seems
to
us,
your
honor,
that
if
to
--
to
investigate
a
fraud
will
say
that
if
it
--
it
resulted
in
a
no
loss
and
then
they
asked
$2000
â€“-
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
for
--
for
your
investigation
when
you've
had
no
loss
it
is
like
pulling
yourself
up
by
your
own
bootstraps.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well,
that
the
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well
that
--
that
may
sustain
the
--
if
the
court
please.
it
may
sustain
the
--
the
imposition
of
the
penalty
where
there
is
a
loss
but
how
can
--
when
they've
investigated,
can
they
come
along
and
say
well
we
haven't
had
any
loss
but
we
want
the
$2000
anyway.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well
they've
â€“
they've
admitted
here
that
there
wasn't
any
loss,
your
honor.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well,
the
only
thing
they
did
in
this
case
was
any
expense
they
had
was
in
--
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
now,
can
--
can
they
recover
that
in
a
civil
case,
the
expense
of
the
criminal
--
criminal
investigation?
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well
they
--
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
well,
that
is
correct,
there.
now,
their
liquidated
damages
provisions
come
--
come
in
under
subsection
2
and
3
where
that
there
are
--
this
--
they
are
specifically
called
liquidated
damages.
and
we
submit,
if
the
court
please,
that
--
that
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
in
this
cause
should
be
reversed
because
it
is
the
imposition
of
a
second
penalty
which
contravenes
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment.
thank
you.
mr.
gustave
h.
dongus
may
it
please
the
court.
again,
i'm
taking
up
with
the
hess
case
again
which
mr.
richter
had
mentioned.
now,
in
that
case
as
to
those
contracts,
eight
contracts,
where
the
government
didn't
prove
any
loss,
the
government
didn't
admit
in
that
case
that
they
had
no
loss.
the
difficulty
there
was
they
couldn't
approve
an
actual
amount
of
loss.but
--
but
here,
they've
had
admitted
there
is
no
--
no
loss
or
damage.
the
point
was
made
of
the
fact,
well,
there
was
a
shortage
in
motor
vehicles
in
1947.
well,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
suppose
these
trucks
were
sold
today,
where
a
veteran
should
--
could
buy
the
vehicles
anywhere.
does
that
mean
to
say
that
--
does
it
mean
to
say,
well,
then
you
can
collect
the
$2000
in
--
in
1947
and
not
collect
it
in
1955?
i
don't
think
anything
turns
on
the
shortage
of
--
of
the
motor
vehicles.
and
the
--
the
government
has
further
contended
that
emphasize
the
fact
that,
well,
this
is
a
civil
remedy
or
if
it
isn't
the
fact
that
it's
a
civil
remedy,
what
is
it?
what
do
we
have
here?
and
as
we
said
there's
nothing
but
punitive
--
that's
punishment.
and
the
petitioner
has
already
paid
a
fine
and
he's
been
punished
once.
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prevents
him
from
being
punished
twice,
thank
you.
