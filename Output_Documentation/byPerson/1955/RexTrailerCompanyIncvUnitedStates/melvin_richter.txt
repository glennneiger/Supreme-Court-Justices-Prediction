mr.
melvin
richter
may
it
please
the
court.
we
think
that
the
marcus
and
hess
decision
of
this
court
317
u.s.
is
--
is
possible
to
this
case.
in
marcus
and
hess,
there
had
been
as
in
this
case,
there
had
been
prior
criminal
convictions
for
fraud.
there,
as
here,
the
defendants
had
pleaded
nolo
contendere
and
to
pay
a
fine
as
had
been
assessed
and
fines
have
been
paid.
subsequently,
in
marcus
and
hess,
civil
proceedings
were
brought
under
the
false
claims
act.
now,
the
provision
of
the
false
claims
act,
on
which
these
proceedings
were
brought,
provided
that
in
the
terms
closely
similar
to
the
surplus
property
act
that's
involved
here,
that
the
defendant
shall
forfeit
and
pay,
and
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
that
mark
it,
false
claims
acts
said
forfeit
to
pay,
whereas,
as
the
statute
here
just
said
provides
pay,
shall
pay
$2000
--
mr.
melvin
richter
no,
no.
mr.
melvin
richter
the
language
is
--
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
right.
i'm
just
trying
to
point
out
that
the
language
is
--
was
stronger
but
as
to
--
mr.
melvin
richter
it's
just
a
matter
of
the
fact,
is
in
the
situation.
mr.
melvin
richter
now,
in
the
court
there,
was
unanimous
in
agreeing
that
the
proceeding
there
was
--
did
not
involve
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
justice
frankfurter;
however,
concurred
on
a
separate
ground
but
he
agreed
with
the
court's
result.
he
agreed
that
there,
in
that
case,
there
had
been
no
violation
of
double
jeopardy
provisions
for
bringing
this
subsequent
suit
for
$2000
plus
double
damages.
mr.
melvin
richter
no,
sir.
we
think
its
our
position
in
this
case
that
whichever
view
you
take,
whether
you
take
the
--
the
view
which
you
espoused,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
or
the
view
that
the
majority
espoused,
that
this
--
and,
nevertheless,
is
not
double
jeopardy.
mr.
melvin
richter
well
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
it's
our
position
that
if
we
adopt
the
view
which,
view
as
far
as
the
marcus
and
hess
that
the
--
there's
no
double
jeopardy
here.
i'd
like
to
just
spend
a
moment
on
that,
if
i
might,
and
then
pass
on
to
the
majority
view.
the
view
which
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
marcus
and
hess
was
to
the
effect
that,
as
i
understand
it,
was
that
congress
can
provide
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
remedies
for
the
punishment
of
a
single
offense.
and
that
it's
immaterial
whether
you'd
designate
them
as
penal
or
compensatory.
if
congress
provides
two
remedies
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
there
are
other
cases
which
i
found
which
are
not
--
but
cited
in
our
brief
which
this
view
was
adopted.
then
there
is
no
double
jeopardy
involved
if
you
pursue
two
of
those
remedies.
mr.
melvin
richter
well
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well
i
--
i
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
if
it
defines
criminal
statute
as
i
understand
generally,
provide
for
imprisonment
or
fine
or
both.
and
you
could,
can
--
and
file,
imprison
the
man
and
fine
him
under
the
criminal
statute
and
still
not
have
double
jeopardy
if
the
statute
provides
for
it.
now
the
--
the
statute
in
this
case
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
proceeding
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
into
two.
mr.
melvin
richter
well
i'm
just
--
and
on
--
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
richter
but
--
well,
i
--
that
the
point
is
this.
all
i
--
i
would
like
to
make
my
position
clear.
all
i'm
trying
to
say
at
this
point
is
that
whichever
view
you
take
--
whichever
view
that
was
announced
in
marcus
and
hess,
whether
you
take
the
majority's
view
or
you
take
mr.
justice
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
frankfurter's
view.
whichever
view,
there
isn't
double
jeopardy
in
this
case.
now
i
â€“
i
would
intend
to
go
in
the
moment.
i
just
was
--
wanted
to
spend
a
few
minutes
on
the
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well
i
--
it
may
very
well
be.
in
this
case
though,
as
applied
in
this
case,
i
think
that
there
would
--
that
there's
no
--
no
problems
have
been
attached
here
because
in
this
case
and
i
--
your
--
the
--
the
statute
here
as
in
the
helvering
--
as
in
false
claims
act,
provided
that
the
civil
remedies
provided,
and
that's
referring
back
to
section
26
(b)
(1)
which
is
involved
here,
shall
be
in
addition
to
all
other
criminal
penalties.
and
that
i
still
remember,
is
provided
by
law.
and
then
the
senate
report,
well,
which
is
on
--
cited
on
page
25
of
our
brief,
the
senate
report
says
that
these
remedies
are
exclusive
of
any
other
similar
remedies
which
united
states
may
have
in
the
said
provisions
of
the
criminal
code
as
related
to
fraud
or
to
--
in
conspiracy
and
referring
to
section
18
u.s.c.
section
80
which
was
that
the
--
mr.
melvin
richter
marcus
and
hess?
mr.
melvin
richter
oh,
yes.
oh,
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
just
,as
i
say,
trying
to
put
a
few
minutes
to
justice
frankfurter's
view
and
then
i
might
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well
i
--
i
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well
--
well
i
--
i
appreciate
the
--
the
problems
that
you
have
with
marcus
and
hess
and
helvering
in
this,
for
that
reason,
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
really
the
--
at
the
outset
of
my
argument.
that
even
on
the
approach
you
took
in
helvering
and
mitchell
--
i
mean
in
marcus
and
hess.
there's
no
double
jeopardy
involved
here.
mr.
melvin
richter
well
--
mr.
melvin
richter
no,
i
expect
to.
mr.
melvin
richter
well
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
there's
--
there's
no
doubt
in
this
case
that
there's
no
damage
that
we
can
reduce
to
any
physical
amount,
to
a
monetary
amount.
and
on
the
other
hand
it's
our
claim
that
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
that's
the
very
function
of
providing
a
minimum
payment
which
i
would
--
i
would
get
to
in
a
--
by
my
past
from
your
approach
i
--
which
i
think
would
show
there's
no
double
jeopardy
in
this
case,
to
the
approach
which
the
court,
the
majority,
took
in
marcus
and
hess.
now,
in
marcus
and
--
the
majority's
approach
there
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
--
the
$2000
for
the
sum
was
double
damage
provision
of
the
false
claims
act
was
compensatory
of
penal.
the
court,
relying
and
while
referring
to
its
early
case
in
helvering
versus
mitchell
said
that
the
question
was
one
of
the
statutory
construction.
and
then,
at
one
--
proceeded
to
point
out
that
the
government
can
sue
and
as
a
private
inquirer
has
rights
similar
to
a
private
person
in
enforcing
its
contracts
that
it
has
two
capacities
in
the
sense,
one
quite
sovereign
in
which
it
brings
suits
to
--
suits
to
take
care
of
the
public
justice,
to
protect
the
public
justice,
and
secondly
has
a
capacity
as
--as
a
private
person
on
which
it
has
rights
to
sue
for
breach
of
contract,
should
cover,
et
cetera.
and
in
the
--
the
court
held
that
in
the
latter
capacity
without
--
that
the
court
would
--
that
the
united
states
was
proceeding
in
the
latter
capacity
as
of
--
as
of
a
quite
politic
in
marcus
and
hess
and
as
such
was
entitled
to
recover
for
fraud
in
which
it
was
perpetuated
upon
it.
and
as
a
result,
the
court
went
on
to
hold
at
--
on
page
18
of
our
brief
that
--
that
we
think
that
the
chief
purpose
of
a
statute
here
which
is
the
false
claims
act,
where
they
had
a
similar
provision
such
as
we
have
here,
was
to
provide
for
restitution
to
the
government
of
money
taking
prominent
by
fraud,
and
that
the
device
of
double
damages
plus
a
specific
sum
was
chosen
to
make
sure
that
the
government
would
be
made
completely
whole.
the
inherent
difficulty
of
choosing
a
proper
specific
sum
recognizing
that
it's
difficult
to
fix
the
sum
of
--
of
--
by
--
and
approve
a
sum
by
damages,
would
be
--
which
would
give
full
restitution
was
a
problem
for
congress.
and
so
the
court
affirmed
as
compensatory
and
therefore,
not
involving
violating
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
the
$2000
plus
double
damage
provision
of
the
false
claims
act.
now,
we
think
that
provision
is
fully
applicable.
i
mean
that
holding
is
very
applicable
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
two
statutes
that
we
have
are
--
have
this
very
same
purpose.
the
surplus
property
act
was
designed
in
this
provision
26
(b)
(1)
and
the
following
b
(2)
and
b
(3),
are
all
designed
to
protect
the
government
against
the
perpetration
or
enable
the
government
to
recover
for
fraud
perpetuated
by
--
on
it
and
we
got
the
surplus
property
program.
the
false
claims
act
involved
in
marcus
and
hess
was
designed
to
prevent
--
permit
the
government
to
recover
for
frauds
perpetuated
on
it
in
connection
with
false
claims
generally.
so,
the
purpose
of
the
two
statutes
was
generally
the
same.
now,
the
language
of
the
two
statutes
were
generally
the
same,
too.
the
only
material
and
difference
between
the
--
the
two
provisions
that
involved
in
marcus
and
hess
and
that
involved
here,
is
that
the
false
claims
act
provides
for
certain
pay
in
this
statute
it
--
it
provides
to
pay
it.
and
as
i
say
--
really
hasn't
--
that
the
language
in
marcus
and
hess,
if
anything,
was
just
stronger
rather
than
the
--
the
language
here.
and
thirdly
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
marcus
and
hess
was
decided
on
--
in
january
of
1943
which
is
about
15
months
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
surplus
property
act
here.
so,
we
think
it's
drawing
from
that.
it's
--
it's
the
fair
assumption
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
language
in
this
false
claims
act
in
enacting
the
comparable
language
of
the
surplus
property
act.
now,
in
addition,
the
court
in
marcus
and
hess
and
in
helvering
and
mitchell
pointed
out
that
it's
really
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
so,
it's
appropriate
in
these
circumstances
to
look
at
the
legislative
intent.
now,
when
doing
that,
first
you
look
to
the
face
of
the
surplus
property
act.
you'll
notice
that
section
26
(d)
which
is
on
page
3
of
our
brief
refers
to
civil
remedies.
referring
back
to
section
26
(b)
quite
characterizes
that
civil
remedy.
the
civil
remedies
provided
in
this
section
shall
be
in
addition
to
all
other
civil
remedies
and
penalties
provided
by
law.
secondly,
its
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
section
b
(1)
which
is
the
provision
that's
involved
here,
appears
in
the
same
section
with
b
(2)
and
b
(3).
and
as
my
brother
says
that
both
b
(2)
and
b
(3)
deal
with
liquidated
damages,
expressly
provide
that
to
compensate
the
government
shall
recover
liquidated
damages.
so
that
we
think
it's
unlikely
that
congress
would
include
in
a
single
provision
of
b
(1),
b
(2),
and
b
(3),
when
2
are
compensatory
and
3
is
intended
to
be
penal.
mr.
melvin
richter
i
think
--
i
think
that's
--
i
--
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
our
position
as
a
proof
of
damage
is
unnecessary.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
however,
and
i
will
get
to
that,
i
just
wanted,
if
i
may
just
go
through
this.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
we
don't
concede
that
there
was
no
damage
here.
that
it's
true
the
suit
that
we
brought
here
was
just
for
the
$2000.
but
that
is
because
--
although
there
was
damage
that
the
government
was
--
did
suffer
damages.
but
there
were
damages
that
were
the
type
which
just
can't
be
reduced
to
a
--
a
monetary
amount.
and
it's
the
very
function
of
a
liquidated
damage
provision
of
contracts
are
this
minimum
damage
provisions
of
$2000
here
on
minimum
damages
in
your
copyright
statute
or
--
or
did
say
a
double
damages
in
your
--
in
your
fair
labor
standards
act
with
--
with
the
element
of
additional
to
double
damage
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
all
of
which
recognized
that
there
are
situations
where
a
defendant
by
his
actions
come
first
commits
a
legal
wrong
against
the
plaintiff
and
which,
however,
it's
impossible
to
--
the
damages
can't
be
reduced
to
a
financial
amount.
you
take
a
copyright
case
--
a
--
which
is
just
one
example.
a
--
someone
infringes
on
a
copyright,
has
a
copyright
for
dramatic
production
say,
like
in
(inaudible)
that
you
have
set
out
in
our
brief.
the
plaintiff
--
the
defendant
infringes
by
--
by
lifting
from
someone
else's
play
it
seemed
and
--
use,
incorporates
in
the
play
which
he
produced.
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
--
that
the
owner
of
the
--
of
the
copyright,
the
plaintiff
has
been
injured
as
result
to
that.
yet,
how
to
reduce
that
to
money
amount?
it
seems
it's
almost
impossible.
so,
as
a
net
result,
the
copyright
statute
has
a
schedule
of
statutory
damage
of
so
much
--
so
much
for
this
type
of
infringement,
so
much
for
this
type
of
thing,
with
a
--
with
a
minimum,
i
think,
in
the
sum
of
$50
to
$250.
and
that's
--
that's
common.
i
mean
that's
--
that's
--
you
go
to
--
go
to
the
woolworth
case
which
was
before
this
court
in
344
u.s.
where
the
--
there
was
an
infringement
under
--
of
the
statute.
woolworth
had
--
had
the
statute,
a
--
a
piece
of
the
statute
which
they
were
selling.
that
in
that
case,
woolworth
proved
that
they
had
--
their
profit
i
--
i
recollect
was
about
$900
of
--
then
they
were
the
defendant.
the
plaintiff
couldn't
prove
any
actual
loss
from
his
infringement.yet
the
court
affirmed
the
$5000
award
under
the
statute.
now,
we
think
that
we
were
damaged
here
in
a
number
of
ways.
i'd
like
to
point
out
before
i
do
--
do
go
into
that
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
i
--
no.
i
don't
think
so.
if
you
--
if
the
court
will
look
at
page
7
and
page
8
of
the
record,
you'll
notice
that
paragraphs
6,
7,
8,
and
9
are
all
more
--
are
all
introductory
to
paragraph
10.
at
least,
what
--
let
me
rephrase
it.
that
the
paragraph
10,
is
really
a
summary
of
what
the
court
--
what
the
defendant
is
alleging
in
the
prior
paragraph.
and
it
says
that
by
reason
of
the
facts
above
set
forth.
now,
the
only
facts
that
they
set
forth
are
that
this
--
that
this
--
the
product
--
the
--
the
vehicles
were
sold
--
were
--
were
being
sold
at
the
sale
at
tinker
field.
that
the
--
there
was
first
to
go
to
priority
holders
and
then
they
go
to
nonpriority
holders.
that
if
the
priority
holders
exhausted
--
then
exhausted,
that
will
go
to
nonpriority
holders
at
the
same
price.
and
all
they're
really
saying
by
--
by
reason
of
the
facts
above
set
forth,
is
that
the
government
suffered
no
monetary
damages
on
the
--
of
that
sale
at
--
at
--
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
had
the
property
not
all
going
to
the
veterans
if
they
would
have
been
in
the
position
to
get
it
at
the
same
price.
so
that
--
that
there
are
other
elements
of
damages
which
we
point
out
on
our
brief.
now,
one
of
the
damages,
that
we
wanted
to
go
to
the
priority
holders.
we
didn't
want
to
go
to
other
people.
and
there
was
no
--
there's
nothing
in
here
to
say
that
any
nonpriority
holders
got
--
received
any
vehicles.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
i'm
sorry
i
just
thought
to
go
outside
of
the
record
that
i
want.
the
fact
is
that,
as
far
as
this
complaint
is
because
this
answer
is
concerned,
all
of
the
vehicles
went
to
priority
holders
and
those
who
were
masquerading
such
as
the
plaintiff,
the
defendant
here
as
priority
holders.
so
that
we
were
damaged
in
the
--
to
the
extent
that
we're
going
to
people
whom
--
to
whom
we
didn't
want
to
sell
the
property
to.
and
they
were
--
they
were
getting
it
by
this
masquerade
of
this.
secondly,
as
mr.
justice
reed
pointed
out
in
helvering
and
mitchell,
the
government
was
--
the
court
held
that
the
50%
addendum
there
was
--
was
compensatory
because
the
government
is
entitled
to
recover
for
the
cause
of
investigating
and
ferreting
of
the
fraud.
we
were
--
we
encountered
the
same
problems
here
of
how
much
money
was
expended
on
ferreting
out
this
fraud.
you
can't
find
out
that
the
government's,
it's
just
one
of
this
things.
it
happens,
the
fraud
is
ferreted
out,
but
you
don't
allocate
money
to
it.
and
it's
all
--
all
this
is
--
are
elements
of
damages
which
we
suffered
here.
i'd
like
to
point
out,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
marcus
and
hess
--
in
marcus
and
hess
there
were
56
contracts
to
which
the
--
the
penalty
of,
if
you
want
to
call
it
penalty,
of
$2000
was
--
was
allowed.
of
that
56
contracts,
eight
of
them
there
was
no
damage
at
all.
the
fraud
had
been
caught
at
the
outset.
there
were
fraudulent
bids
submitted
but
the
--
before
any
money
was
paid
out
on
it,
before
anything
was
done,
the
fraud
was
detected.
so
that
note
that
the
government
then
suffered
no
damage
in
--
in
that
case.
and
--
and
that
goes
--
eight
contracts
in
marcus
and
hess.
now
furthermore,
--
mr.
melvin
richter
that's
true.
mr.
melvin
richter
well
it
--
mr.
melvin
richter
if
--
if
you
read
paragraph
10,
it
says
that
by
reason
of
the
facts
above
set
forth,
the
plaintiff
was
not
damaged
which
is
--
this
is
by
reason
--
that
this
is
--
that
there
are
conclusions
from
this
paragraph
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
did
not
suffer
any
loss
if
you
go
on
now,
because
of
the
sale
of
said
trucks
and
received
the
full
advertised
offering
price
for
the
same
and
had
said
trucks
had
not
been
sold
to
persons
who
purchased
them.
they
would
have
been
sold
at
the
same
price
to
other
priority
and
nonpriority
purchasers.
now,
their
allegation
of
no
damage
is
--
is
a
limited
one.
it
does
or
doesn't
do
anything
to
negate
the
fact
that
the
government
was
--
has
incurred
damages
as
far
as
investigating
the
fraud
was
concerned.
it
doesn't
do
anything
about
negating
the
damage
that
the
government
suffered
by
virtue
of
selling
it
to
people
to
whom
it
had
no
intention
to
selling
the
property
to.
the
--
the
government
was
willing
to
sell
the
property
to
nonpriority
holders,
after
all
the
priority
holders
were
satisfied
and
not
before.
the
fact
is
in
this
case
they
--
the
defendant
masqueraded
themselves
as
the
priority
holders
by
misuse
of
veteran
certificates
and
managed
to
obtain
these
vehicles.
now,
the
fact
if
you
--
this
--
it
gives
me
a
post
and
i
don't
know
if
it
does
you,
but
it
gives
me
a
post
if
there
was
no
advantage,
if
there
was
no
advantage
that
they
were
going
to
gain
by
engaging
this
--
this
fraud.
why
did
they
do
it?
the
fact
is,
i
think,
that
everybody
knows
that
in
1947,
at
this
time,
there
was
a
shortage
of
all
sorts
of
motor
vehicle.
the
fact
is,
i
know
personally,
i
had
to
wait
about
15
months
before
i
can
get
a
--
could
get
a
â€“
obtain
a
passenger
car.
and
these
people
who
are
in
the
business
of
selling
motor,
automobile
equipment
and
they,
the
price
of
which
they
could
get
is
resell
of
these
--
of
these
vehicles
once
they
got
them
was
substantially
higher
or
--
or
presumptively.
they
wouldn't
have
done
it
unless
they
could
have
made
a
profit
on
it.
so,
if
the
government
was
undertaking
to
sell
these
--
these
automotive
equipment
to
certain
people
at
a
price,
usually
a
log
of
the
--
of
the
advertisements
forbid,
said
that
it
will
be
sold
to
nonpriority
holders
after
all
the
priority
holders
had
been
satisfied.
it
--
it
was
--
it
was
just
so
much
window
--
not
window.
their
--
this
was
just
highly
unrealistic.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
most
of
these
instances,
the
priorities
holders
themselves
didn't
get
all
the
vehicles
they
want.
mr.
melvin
richter
do
away.
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
richter
well
we
would
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
we
--
that's
right
sir.
we
--
we
wanted
to
make
sure
that
these
--
these
vehicles
went
to
certain
priority
holders.
veterans
was
one
of
the
priority
holders.
government
agencies
were
others.
certain
other
rfc,
small
loan,
there
are
other
various
people,
but
we
wanted
to
make
sure
that
these
vehicles
went
first
to
the
priority
holders.
and
then
if
there
were
any
leftover,
in
the
rare
instance
where
if
any
were
leftover,
then
they
could
go
to
nonpriority
holders.
the
fact
is
that
by
masquerading
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
as
priority
holders,
as
veterans,
the
--
the
defendants
in
this
case
prevented
the
government
from
achieving
its
purpose.
and
to
that
extent,
how
the
government
as
a
private
person,
was
damaged
although,
in
a
way
which
you
can't
reduce
to
monetary
amount,
and
that's
why
you
have
this
$2000.
mr.
melvin
richter
all
i
was
--
the
government,
of
course,
is
the
government
at
all
times.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
didn't
intend
to
say
the
government
was
a
private
person.
what
i
was
trying
to
--
mr.
melvin
richter
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
melvin
richter
i
don't
know
what
happened
to
the
trucks,
i
just
gathered
they
were
resold
and
at
a
profit.
i
don't
know.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
with
the
--
with
the
amount
of
profit
that
they
--
profit
they
made
assuming
they
made
a
profit
is
unknown.
it's
not
in
the
record.
i
just
want
--
i
just
to
answer
justice
frankfurter.
all
we
were
saying,
all
i
intend
to
say,
was
that
the
government
has
the
same
right
to
maintain
a
suit
for
damages,
the
way
a
private
person
does.
and
that
the
government
in
that
sense
has
thea
dual
capacity.
that
one,
they
can
bring
a
suit
of
private
--
a
suit
for
private
damages
--
a
damage
for
breach
of
contract.
i
think
there's
cases
like
that
practically
everyday
up
here,
suits
for
breach
of
contract
by
or
against
the
government.
and
that
is
or
as
any
other
type
of
damage
that
the
government
has
encountered
as
a
--
as
a
private
--
as
a
--
like
any
private
individual.
i'm
not
referring
to
the
tort
claim
acts
at
this
point.
mr.
melvin
richter
i
--
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
--
mr.
melvin
richter
well
--
(voice
overlap)
to
recover
damages.
mr.
melvin
richter
justice
frankfurter,
i
--
let
me
explain.
if
--
if
there,
suppose
there
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
i'm
just
following
the
teachings
of
the
cases
of
this
decision
of
this
court.
and
marcus
and
hess
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
richter
oh,
i've
tried
that
and
i'm
still
in
the
forest
--
mr.
melvin
richter
but
the
point
is,
that
i'm
trying
to
--
we've
--
i've
got
--
what
you
have
here
is
the
most
recent
expression
of
this
court
in
marcus
and
hess.
you
have
a
statute
which
is
closely
similar
to
that
in
marcus
and
hess.
mr.
melvin
richter
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
melvin
richter
well,
i
have
the
opinion
here
--
mr.
melvin
richter
no.
mr.
melvin
richter
no.
mr.
melvin
richter
it
says
here
it
would
present
the
strange
anomaly
indeed,
(inaudible)
page
550
of

u.s.
it
would
present
a
strange
anomaly
indeed
if
having
the
power
to
make
contracts
and
hold
property
as
other
persons,
natural
or
artificial.
they
are
--
were
not
entitled
to
same
remedies
for
their
protection.
in
other
words,
the
government
has
--
has
a
body
quality
can
--
has
the
right
to
sue
for
compensation.
mr.
melvin
richter
oh.
sure.
but
it
--
it's
comparable
in
the
sense
that
they
operate
--
oh,
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
i
don't
think
we're
at
odds.
mr.
melvin
richter
no.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
we
have
the
same
rights
to
sue
for
compensation
for
affecting
us,
as
a
private
person,
within
the
confines
of
marcus
and
hess,
i
am
not
trying
to
go
beyond
that.
i'd
like
to
point
out
before
i
sit
down
--
mr.
melvin
richter
--
that
in
marcus
and
hess,
there
were,
as
i
said
56
contracts.
on
eight
of
them,
no
damages
were
proved.
and
on
the
remaining
46
--
48,
i'm
sorry,
the
damages
which
were
proved
by
the
united
states
ranged
from
all,
about
$50.
and
an
individual
contract
for
which
we
receives
the
$2000
statutory
amount
up
to
$40,000
with
the
bulk
of
them
being,
well
below
--
well
a
substantial
number
of
them
are
--
are
below
$1000.
we
think
that
on
the
authority
of
marcus
and
hess,
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
below.
