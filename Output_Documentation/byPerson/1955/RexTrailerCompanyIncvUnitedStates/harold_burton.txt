justice
harold

the
--the
petitioner's
--
the
petitioner's
conduct
in
this
case
would
amount
to
a
frustration
of
the
government's
method
of
disposing
of
its
surplus
property,
wouldn't
it?
justice
harold
burton
now,
if
that's
true,
may
not
congress
consider
this
thing
which
in
the
order
of
evaluating
damages
might
be
provided
for
by
statute
and
is
sort
of
an
unliquidated
damage?
justice
harold
burton
yes,
on
government's
belief
that
the
--
this
kind
of
practice
frustrates
the
government's
right
to
dispose
of
its
surplus
property
in
the
manner
that
congress
has
provided.
therefore
congress
puts
this
compensatory
damages
in
the
act
as
a
sort
of
an
unliquidated
damage
as
being
a
thing
hard
to
prove.
it
just
puts
a
--
in
a
--
say
given
amount.
justice
harold
burton
may
the
government
not
be
damaged
by
this
frustration
in
a
sum
which
is
hard
to
put
down
in
figures
actually
proves
so
the
government
--
congress
has
provide
this
--
this
unliquidated
--
but
assume
--
