justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
damage
proved
in
the
hess
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
don't
challenge
the
doctrine
that
were
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
if
you
–
if
you
prove
that
there
was
damage
and
it's
difficult
of
ascertainment
what
the
damages
were
in
dollars
in
the
offense
is
up
to
the
defendant
to
cut
it
down
to
the
--
their
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
that
is
being
questioned
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
sir.
because
that's
the
scott
versus
marcella
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it
has
in
marcus
against
hess,
a
--
a
collusive
bid
inferentially
implies
that
if
they're
having
in
collusive
bid
they
didn't
find
there's
any
difference.
we
do
or
plead
better
than
the
collusion
because
the
collusion
was
for
the
very
preference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
bidding
down
the
price.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
criminal
features,
the
penal
--
that
they
tend
to
the
unquestionable
(inaudible)
both
prison
settings
and
money?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
but
what
is
the
expenditure
--
the
punishment
of
that
--
that
penal
provision
before
the
appellant,
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
five
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
--
why
is
(inaudible)
answer
by
the
facts
that
the
money
fines
that
when
congress
provides
to
fine
that's
when
it
takes
care
of
money
lawsuits
that
can't
be
liquidated
in
turn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
if
you
--
it's
management
today
and
the
government
suffers
but
it
can't
tell
how
much
it
suffers
that
it
fixes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
can
prove
damage
then
we
can
prove
that
--
that
the
whole
basis
of
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
are
no
damages.
justice
felix
frankfurter
insofar
as
there
are
vague
damages,
the
fine
will
take
care
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
disagree
with
your
position,
you
know,
but
i
--
you're
free
to
agree
with
a
lot
of
argument
that's
been
taken,
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
allocate
the
salary
phase
of
the
highest
officials
in
the
government.
they
may
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
this
case
and
so
you
allocate
part
of
the
attorney
general's
salary
as
loss
to
the
government
because
otherwise,
it
might
have
been
doing
something
more
profitable
on
that
property.
i
mean
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
law
--
the
lawsuit
is
what
you
put
the
government
to
expense
in
finding
out
whether
there
was
a
loss.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
took
a
lot
of
time
and
claims
and
--
and
salaries
to
find
that
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
that
--
that
the
liquidated
damages
that
it
liquidates
something.
there's
nothing
here
to
liquidate
because
there's
been
no
damage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
going
trying
to
draw
and
make
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
benefit
for
that
because
the
government
can
in
this
case
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
forfeit
is
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
become
important
that
it
can't
--
it
can't
say
it
strongly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that's
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
government
accept
that
mode
of
arguing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
a
(inaudible)
can
translate
the
other
view
and
the
government
says
that
it
--
the
other
view
is
the
one
that
(inaudible)
that
on
there
is
probably
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
--
i
understand
you
want
to
rip
the
case
but
i
have
decided
on
some
rationally,
so
here,
in
the
grounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
well
the
question
is
whether
you
must
dispose
of
it
all
in
one
--
in
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
case
of
proceeding
or
you
may
break
it
up
into
two.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
take
your
time
on
this,
but
i
just
want
to
know
whether
a
fellow
who
had
great
difficulty
such
as
i
do
on
the
--
both
with
the
mitchell
mode
of
argument
–
or
he
hess
mode
of
argument
whether
if
you
can
--
reconcile
themselves
to
those
modes
of
argument,
namely,
by
sticking
labels
on
and
call
them
civil,
you
take
care
of
everything
whether
if
hasn't
got
any
or
has
difficulty
with
that
--
great
difficulty
myself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
--
whether
the
government
--
what
the
government's
attitude
do.
so,
i've
come
up
with
what
i'd
have
to
say
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
this
case
tests
that.
this
case
tests
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
have
--
because
both
in
mitchell
and
in
hess
there
were
arguments
that
the
government
was
out
of
pocket.
and
if
the
government
is
out
of
the
pocket,
then
it
can
fix
them,
can
liquidate
what
is
out
of
the
pocket
without
any
nice
calculation.
but
here,
it
is
conceded,
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
takes
the
ground
from
under.
but
if
you
--
if
--
if
it'd
be
a
starting
point
that,
in
the
fact,
that
the
government
was
not
out
of
pocket.
then
all
they
talk
about
compensatory
that
goes
out
of
the
window,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
though.
but
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
convince
it
for
something
that
you
haven'
t
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that's
what
damages
mean,
monetary.
if
you're
going
to
give
$2000,
well,
you
have
to
have
some
dollars.
justice
felix
frankfurter
imagine,
let
me
shift.
so,
i
could
make
my
mind
shift.
suddenly
there
comes
a
point
when
the
government
becomes
a
private
person.
how
--
how
does
help
the
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
trying
to
--
and
wonder,
what
kind
of
intellectual
company
you
get
on
to
the
fact
of
saying
the
government
has
the
same
right
that
a
private
person
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
dealing
here
with
an
exertion
of
governmental
authority
which
is,
it
is
exerted
in
a
certain
way
twice,
the
constitution
forbids.
so,
how
do
i
get
any
clarification
by
saying
some
of
the
(inaudible)
and
gives
me
a
new
set
of
theatrical
equipment
and
it
deals
with
a
private
scenario.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
i
know
what
you
are
talking
about,
but
i
don't
know
why
you
talk
that
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
follow
everything
that's
been
said
in
this
court
on
this
subject,
then
i
can
assure
you,
you'll
gain
great
confusion
which
is
the
motto
of
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
