could
the
government
by
that
admission
admit
that
it
suffered

does
it
merely
admit
that
the

there

are
there
not
other
losses
that
the
--
that
the
government
could
be
put
to
by
reason
of
this
transaction
and
by
reason
of

of
their
necessity
for
enforcing
this
law
against
such
actions
that
the

guilty
of?

you
any
authority
for

i
did
not
think
that
a
fine
had
any
relation
to
the
damages
that
the
government
or
anybody
else
might
suffer.
i
thought
that
was
a
penal
provision
just
as
much
as
punishment.
it
was
an
alternative
that

that
the
government
imposes
for
the
commission
of
a
crime
either
imprisonment
or
a
fine
or
both
but
without

obliged
to
rehabilitate

veterans
in
another
