mr.

chief

warren
isn't
there
a
middle
ground
mr.

couldn't
--
couldn't
it
be
suggested
to
a
man
that
he'd
be
represented
by
independent
counsel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
recommend

lawyers
who
solicited

chief

earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you're
--
you
seem
to
take
some
comfort
out
of
the
fact
that
he
was
solicited
by
12
to
16
lawyers
and
he
didn't
take
any
of
them.
chief
justice

and
i
asked
you
of
that
(voice

--
chief

without
any
thought
of
settlement,
didn't
think
(voice

--
chief

warren
that
was
just
a
gift
to
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
this
appendix
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
try
it
before
a
jury,
did
you?
chief

warren
did
the
man
have
the
confidence
--
would
you
think
to
understand
a
medical
report
of
that

but
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
captain
of
the
ship
knew
of
the
characteristics
of
this
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
knew
it,
they
knew
it
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
beyond
that.
suppose
--
suppose
they
knew
the
other
proclivities
of
this
man
other
than
just
having
the
appearance
of
being
effeminate,
would
that
affect
the
seaworthiness
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
that
isn't
it.
i
say
suppose
the
captain
knew
of
his
proclivities
and
in
spite
of
that
knowledge,
he
signed
him
up
to
go
--
go
aboard
ship
and
associate
with
these
other
members
of
the
crew.
would
you
say
that
affected
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
seaworthy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
say
mere
effeminacy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
soliciting
business.
they
were
--
were
they
there
soliciting
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
soliciting
his
business?
is
that
what
they
were
there
for?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
were
they
trying
to
get
him
to
employ?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
sure.
they're
soliciting
his
business
weren't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
hold
anything
against
a
man
for
not
giving
in
to
set
persuasion,
would
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
don't
you
think
you
are
taking
into
consideration
also,
mr.
hanrahan,
the
--
the
nature
of
the
injury
that
the
man
has?
now,
you
were
talking
a
little
while
ago
about
a
man
losing
a
finger.
don't
you
think
that
they
ought
to
be
a
lot
more
consider
--
a
lot
more
careful
when
they're
dealing
with
a
man
who
has
had
a
severe
blow
on
the
head
that
went
through
his
skull
and
they
gave
him
a
mental
condition
than
they
would
if
he
happened
to
have
lost
a
finger
and
they
were
negotiating?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
let
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
that
the
--
your
claims
adjustor
and
the
--
and
the
--
an
unschooled
seaman
or
layman
in
the
same
sense
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
this
man
have
--
do
this
man
have
much
education?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
he
could
write?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
better
step
to
the
lectern
mister,
so
you
can
be
heard
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
really,
that
isn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
