justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
(inaudible)
should
have
done
it
earlier.
when
you
say
--
when
you
say
they'll
ask
the
court
approval,
do
you
mean
they
will
have
to
litigate,
there
is
no
laws
by
which
they
can
--
is
there
any
informal
way
as
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
that
they
will
--
they
will
take
away
and
sue,
is
that
it?
i
just
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
--
you
mean,
you're
--
assume
that
to
be
solved,
there
is
no
other
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
which
a
judge,
a
federal
judge
begins
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
now,
one
thing
i
can
understand,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
(voice
overlap)
--
does
the
seaman
union
have
a
legal
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
went
through
the
annual
report
of
the
legal
aid
bureau,
they
have
(inaudible)
bureaus,
seamen,
clients
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
take
many
of
these
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
companies
--
the
companies
can't
suggest
a
lawyer
that
will
be
very
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
whether
there
is
some
standing
applicable
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
is
there
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
there
a
standing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
legal
advice
to
which
a
seaman
naturally
(inaudible)
in
new
york
harbor
or
in
the
court
of
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
axtell,
what
would
you
say
is
the
legal
difference
of
the
position
between
yourself
and
your
opponent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
misrepresentations
to
the
strength
of
this
case
or
the
statement
not
to
misrepresentation,
the
representation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
tell
me
concern
(inaudible)
to
your
petition
for
certiorari,
have
you
got
your
petition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
whatever
the
opinion
is,
you
turn
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
just
ask
for
information.
the
copy
that
i
have
(inaudible)
says
similarly
this
“misrepresentation”
(inaudible)
i'd
like
to
know
(inaudible)
why
is
the
word
misrepresentation
a
quotable
word?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
have
you
got
the
opinion
there?
(inaudible)
well,
in
the
opinion,
perhaps
you
have
it
in
your
mind.
the
opinion
says
similarly
quote
misrepresentation
in
quotation.
i
want
to
know
the
source
of
that
quotation
(inaudible)
never
mind.
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
is
that
the
rule
of
law,
that
no
release
should
be
deemed
valid,
unless
the
claimant,
suppose
actively
represented
by
a
lawyer
and
the
claimant
had
a
doctor
of
his
own
choice.
what
do
you
say
to
this
court
announcing
such
a
rule
of
law?
in
order
to
release
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
lawyer
did
take
care
of
anything
that's
said
about
the
wage
or
the
--
or
the
severity
of
the
case
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
doctor
can
talk
to
the
phraseology.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
--
that
might
your
answer.
it
is
an
appropriate
assumption
if
the
people
are
dealing
it
on
(inaudible)
in
here,
you
haven't
got
people
dealing
(inaudible)
