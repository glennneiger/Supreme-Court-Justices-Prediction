mr.
charles
a.
ellis
if
the
court
please.
this
is
a
case
which
involves
primarily
i
think
and
respondent's
counsel
insist
that
it
involves
primarily
a
question
of
a
seaman's
release.
it
involves
incidentally
though
along
with
that
also
some
very
important
questions
of
liability
and
of
injury.
the
background
of
the
case
is
that
its
not
a
startlingly
pornographic.
the
petitioner
was
a
seaman
on
a
coastal
oil
tanker,
a
negro
described
by
the
district
court
as
an
upstanding
type
of
individual
who
neither
smoked
nor
drank.
there
was
(inaudible)
or
so,
a
puerto
rican
--
i
mean
a
cuban
negro
who
was
a
messman
and
who
was
called
by
some
of
the
crew
a
queer,
by
others
a
fruit
and
other
denominations
like
that.
and
he
was
described
as
being
exceedingly
feminine
and
having
one
of
the
principles
in
the
particular
pornographic
incident,
as
a
girl
friend
and
they
gave
him
jewelry
and
used
perfume
and
so
forth.
well,
the
--
on
the
evening
of
the
12th
of
january,
1950
the
petitioner
was
looking
for
someone
to
play
cards
with
as
was
frequently
the
case
on
the
boat.
and
he
came
to
a
room
down
on
the
boat
occupied
by
three
men
and
in
there,
in
addition
to
the
three
men
was
this
man
medina.
and
as
he
open
--
as
petitioner
opened
the
door
he
found
according
to
his
testimony
the
medina
engaged
simultaneously
in
homosexuality
with
two
men
and
he
was
startled
by
it.
he
went
and
reported
it
to
the
chief
steward
who
was
his
superior
and
the
superior
of
medina
and
to
the
union
delegate
on
the
boat.
that
was
reported
then
to
the
captain
the
next
morning
according
to
the
chief
steward
by
the
chief
steward,
some
of
the
evidence
indicates
it
was
reported
that
night.
but
anyway
the
chief
steward
testifies
that
when
it
was
reported
where
the
captain
said
that
medina
had
already
reported
it
and
that
he
would
take
care
of
it.
that
--
then
one
of
the
witnesses
i
think
it's
the
union
delegate
kaplan
he
testified
that
--
medina
said
during
the
course
of
the
forenoon
there
he
was
going
to
kill
the
petitioner,
thompson.
well,
anyway
that
evening
there
was
a
meeting
held
in
one
of
the
rooms
aboard
ship
to
discuss
apparently
primarily
a
question
of
whether
this
incident
would
be
reported
to
the
coastguard
and
the
coastguard
requested
to
remove
this
man
from
the
ship
as
an
unfit
member
of
the
crew.
that
was
attended
by
among
others
the
petitioner
and
the
three
men
allegedly
involved
in
the
pornographic
incident.
and
the
two
men
that
were
engaged
with
medina
in
this
act,
one
named
pittaway
and
other
named
(inaudible),
they
didn't
back
up
the
petitioner's
story
at
the
hearing
now
on
the
boat,
of
course
they
were
involved
too,
but
they
offered
to
quit
the
ship.
the
--
but
by
reason
of
it
being
petitioner's
story
only
of
what
happened,
why,
the
meeting
wound
up
indeterminate.
and
before
the
end
of
the
meeting
some
apparently
about
10
to
15
minutes
before
the
end
of
that
meeting
medina
left
the
room.
it
develops
later
then
that
what
he
did
was
he
went
and
got
according
to
the
one
part
of
the
testimony,
he
stole
the
key
according
to
some
other
testimony
he
got
from
the
steward
the
key
to
the
galley
and
got
a
meat
cleaver.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
meat
cleaver
that
thompson,
the
petitioner
himself
was
trying
to
use
in
chopping
meat,
very
heavy
meat
cleaver.
and
then
as
the
rest
of
the
men
were
coming
out
along
side
one
of
the
passage
ways
on
the
boat
medina
was
there,
described
as
being
up
against
the
wall,
one
of
the
men
that
passed
before
thompson
described
it
that
way
and
then
as
thompson
came
by
he
yelled
out
in
a
loud
screech
of
voice,
â€œi
am
going
to
kill
you,
you
so
and
so,"
and
clubbed
him
three
times
with
all
his
might
on
the
head
with
the
meat
cleaver.
the
testimony
indicates
that
if
as
a
manner
of
fact
the
petitioner
hadn't
had
an
extraordinarily
abnormally
think
skull
he
would
have
been
killed
instantly.
as
it
happened
the
blade
cut
through
the
two
parts
of
the
skull
but
didn't
actually
penetrate
apparently
the
brain.
it
did
though
according
to
encephalograms
and
reports
from
two
hospitals
where
encephalograms
were
taken
produce
encephalopathy
due
to
trauma
which
is
--
which
means
a
disease
of
the
brain.
it's
far
greater
than
concussion.
he
was
in
the
hospital
for
about
something
over
5
months,
that
is
in
the
--
in
hospitals.
he
was
in
several
hospitals.
he
--
he
was
taken
off
the
boat
and
put
in
one
there
in
a
texas
port
where
they
landed
and
then
sent
to
houston,
then
sent
to
new
orleans
and
then
sent
to
stapleton
and
while
he
was
at
new
orleans
he
had
to
go
back
to
texas
to
attend
the
criminal
trial
of
medina.
but
on
the
train
he
was
so
disabled,
he
got
sick
and
had
to
be
taken
off,
taken
to
the
hospital
and
treated
there.
and
the
trial
postponed.
medina
by
the
way
was
tried
and
convicted
and
sent
to
prison.
then
after
he
had
been
in
the
hospital
5
or
6
months
and
he
was
discharged
into
a
condition
of
out-patient
then
and
he
got
$300
from
the
defendants
to
take
a
trip
down
to
arkansas
where
he
originally
came
from
apparently
to
take
some
salt
baths,
thought
he
would
feel
better
and
they
had
passed
him
the
money
and
he
went
down
there
and
then
came
back.
and
when
he
came
back
he
went
to
see
mr.
mahoney
the
man
who
had
advanced
him
the
money.
incidentally
he
had
correspondence
with
mahoney.
mahoney
had
told
him
even
while
he
--
before
he
arrived
in
new
york
i
will
be
glad
to
see
you
and
so
forth.
i
mention
that
because
respondent's
counsel
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
the
man
approached
them
to
settle
his
case.
and
that
he
acted
on
his
own,
he
insisted
on
acting
on
his
own.
the
picture
is
one
though
of
pitiful
reliance
as
shown
by
the
way
by
their
own
--
by
the
correspondence
the
letters
that
respondent
themselves
introduced
in
evidence
pitiful
reliance
on
sealing
&
jarvis,
the
agents
for
the
defendant
shipowner
and
on
mahoney.
so
when
he
got
back
he
went
to
see
mahoney
for
discussion
of
settlement
possible
getting
some
money
out
of
the
case.
and
mahoney
had
some
discussion
with
him
and
then
sent
him
to
a
man
named
barron
who
was
the
agent
for
the
insurance
underwriter.
and
mahoney
told
him
according
to
petitioner's
testimony
that
he
didn't
think
they
could
pay
more
after
--
by
the
way
speaking
to
barron,
that
they
didn't
think
--
he
didn't
think
they
could
pay
him
more
than
the
$4000
because
you're
well.
the
--
he
was
sent
however
to
barron
to
have
a
discussion
with
him
and
he
had
to
--
he
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
this
transpired
before
he
went
to
arkansas,
this
--
what
i
just
mentioned.
he
had
two
conferences
with
barron,
was
sent
to
barron,
barron
testifies
that
when
he
approached
him
he
first
asked
for
a
$15,000
in
settlement,
but
he
thought
he
managed
to
talk
him
down
to
$6000
at
that
first
conference.
and
then
when
he
got
back
from
arkansas
he
paints
it
as
a
story
where
the
petitioner
was
asking
for
$6000
and
he
told
him
then
that
he
has
already
saved
money
if
he
took
$4000
instead
of
hiring
an
attorney
because
most
attorney's
charge
one-third
of
recovery
and
now
the
pitiful
reliance
on
the
one
hand
of
his
man
and
the
abject
submission
off
into
overreaching
is
illustrated
if
by
well,
all
through
the
negotiations,
but
also
by
that
particular
aspect
of
the
case.
imagine
a
man
being
told
that
on
the
one
hand
he
do
better
off,
they're
talking
about
a
figure
of
$6000
now
and
that
he'd
do
better
off
not
to
hire
attorneys
that
would
save
attorney's
fees
and
then
whack
it
there
because
they
are
about
a
third
and
then
whack
the
$6000
by
the
third,
retain
the
$2000
even
on
that
item
for
the
defendants
and
gave
him
the
$4000.
he
managed
to
convince
this
man
that
that
was
better
for
him.
they
also
told
him
--
barron
told
him
quite
specifically
that
in
regard
to
the
legal
matter
he
had
a
very
weak
case.
the
representation
there
was
that
his
right
of
recovery
depended
on
proving
that
the
shipowner
company
had
notice
of
the
dangerous
character
of
medina,
when
they
shipped
him
on
board.
in
other
words
the
old
common
law
rule
of
anyone's
liability
for
his
own
negligence
which
was
long
before
the
jones
act,
long
before
any
of
the
other
modern
employee's
liability
legislation.
in
fact
you
can
find
a
case
to
that
effect
way
back
in
i
think
about
volume
one
or
two
reprint,
that
if
a
man
is
negligent
in
hiring
somebody
that
is
absolutely
a
danger
to
other
people
he
was
liable
even
then.
but
they
were
talking
as
of
a
time
when
the
jones
act
was
in
existence
for
one
thing
and
that
confers
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence
and
this
court
has
held
in
two
cases
where
it's
true
the
one
who
committed
the
assault
was
somewhat
a
superior,
one
was
a
foremen,
the
stevedore
and
the
other
was
boatswain
on
a
boat.
they
held
that
where
the
assault
was
committed
by
them
that
commission
of
that
assault
was
negligence
under
the
jones
act.
the
court
has
never
had
before
it
denied
certiorari
in
a
case
that
would
have
presented
it
perhaps
in
the
jones
case,
jones
against
lykes
brothers
some
time
ago
has
never
had
before
it
the
application
that
two
men
of
equal
disposition,
equal
status
on
the
boat.
but
the
rationality
of
the
jones
decision
seems
to
be
--
judge
learned
hand's
views
in
fact
comparing
it
with
some
of
the
others
seems
to
be
that
a
mere
fight
doesn't
show
such
a
malicious
disposition
of
a
man
on
board
as
to
create
on
the
one
hand
unseaworthiness
or
to
constitute
negligence.
whereas
the
use
of
a
meat
cleaver
or
something
like
that
such
as
was
involved
in
the
boudoin
case
before
your
honor's
last
term,
by
the
way
there
the
man
if
i
recall
correctly
was
hit
one
time.
but
that
was
--
no,
that
wasn't
a
meat
cleaver
case
that
was
a
case
of
the
brandy
bottle.
but
it
cited
the
keen
case
that
judge
learned
hand
had
decided
in
the
second
circuit
that
did
involve
a
meat
cleaver
assault.
and
there
the
meat
cleaver
was
used
for
one
blow,
here
the
man
was
struck
three
times.
in
both
those
cases,
both
the
keen
case
and
the
boudoin
case
by
the
way
the
assaulting
man
was
drunk
at
the
time
and
yet
the
ground
of
holding
unseaworthiness
in
the
case
was
that
the
man
was
not
fit
to
be
a
member
of
the
crew.
he
was
--
the
very
happening
of
the
assault
showed
conclusively
that
the
ship
was
unseaworthy.
now
in
this
case
the
man
was
perfectly
sober,
medina.
he
was
simply
this
kind
of
character
that
weird
sort
of
creature
that
shouldn't
have
been
on
the
boat
in
the
first
place
and
whose
act
in
assaulting
this
man
with
a
meat
cleaver
certainly
show
that
it's
--
if
there
is
a
jones
act
liability
there
is
unseaworthiness
liability
along
the
line
of
the
boudoin
case
and
the
keen
case.
mr.
charles
a.
ellis
i
think,
i
however
that
--
mr.
charles
a.
ellis
only
in
--
only
in
this
connection,
the
--
insofar
as
is
involved
the
representations
made
by
barron
in
obtaining
the
release.
now,
in
fact
--
mr.
charles
a.
ellis
yes,
what
the
law
was.
barron
--
barron
represented
that
to
him,
one
of
his
representations
was
that
in
order
to
recover
he
would
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
had
notice
of
the
viciousness
of
this
man.
now
that
point
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
involved
in
boudoin,
that
thought
was
involved
in
keen
and
that
points
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
so
far
as
unseaworthy,
where
the
law
is
concerned
is
always
been
held,
go
back
as
to
the
(inaudible)
for
instance.
there,
it
was
a
case
where
there
was
one
boat
in
the
forepeak
part
of
a
ship
which
proves
to
be
defective.
it
couldn't
possibly
have
been
discovered
by
any
investigation
whatever,
but
the
boat
was
built
so
as
to
let
water
in
to
settle
the
boat
off,
settle
the
ship
off
and
that
water
was
let
in
and
due
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
defective
head
on
one
little
boat
there
and
water
seeped
in
and
destroyed
some
cargo,
some
rather
valuable
tropical
type
cargo,
the
boat
was
unseaworthy.
so
the
law
has
always
been
to
the
effect
that
unseaworthiness
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
negligence
of
the
owner.
mr.
charles
a.
ellis
the
specific
application
in
a
cleaver
case,
yes.
but
the
--
the
doctrine
no,
in
fact
we
cite
in
our
brief
several
cases
involving
unseaworthiness
by
reason
of
members
of
the
crew
antedating
this
incident.
for
--
mr.
charles
a.
ellis
there
were
--
there
were
dicta.
there
were
rulings.
there
were
rulings
somewhat
to
that
effect,
yes.
but
to
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
ellis
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
ellis
that's
right.
this
isn't
--
now
bear
in
mind
your
honor,
this
isn't
a
fraud
case
necessarily,
in
fact
perhaps
i
haven't
--
i
think
i
have
missed
pointing
out
one
very
important
aspect
of
this
case,
there
are
two
lines
of
decisions
in
this
court,
one
is
concerning
releases.
one
is
represented
by
garret
against
moore-mccormack
case
which
is
the
seamen's
case.
the
other
is
represented
by
callen
against
pennsylvania
railroad
co.
and
a
number
of
cases
that
have
followed
it
which
are
federal
employees
liability
cases
and,
and
relate
also
to
other
types
of
individuals
other
than
seamen
or
other
than
beneficiaries
of
a
trust.
now,
seamen
--
it's
been
held
in
garrett
against
moore-mccormack
that
the
burden
of
proof
to
sustain
a
seaman's
release
is
on
the
defendant.
the
defendant
must
prove
that
the
release
was
obtained
fairly
that
the
man
had
full
understanding
of
his
rights
and
that
he
was
not
overreached
in
anyway
and
fair
consideration
pay.
now
under
callen,
under
the
callen
case
the
court
divided
there
on
that
very
point
on
the
rest
of
the
case
though,
they
--
there
seemed
to
have
been
no
division.
there
were
four
justices
who
thought
that
perhaps
the
same
rule
that
applied
to
seamen
should
be
applied
out
of
liberality
to
these
other
railroad
employees.
but
the
--
the
majority
held
that
no,
they
were
different
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
them.
now,
we
--
we
have
a
case
here
where
we
start
out
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
to
prove
that
this
man
had
full
understanding
of
his
rights.
now
how
could
he
possibly
have
full
understanding
of
his
rights
since
his
rights
are
rights
which
arise
out
of
unseaworthiness
and
out
of
negligence?
we
think
also
there's
a
case
for
jones
act
negligence
here
due
to
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
breach
of
duty
here
on
the
part
of
this
assault
that
that
constituted
negligence
within
the
jones
act
concept.
but
how
could
that
possibility
be
a
full
understanding
of
his
legal
rights
on
the
one
hand
when
he
is
told
that
his
rights
of
getting
anything
passed
$200
maintenance
and
cure
depend
on
proving
notice
to
the
owner
that
this
man
is
a
vicious
character
and
when
he
is
told
as
regards
his
disability
that
he
is
well.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
man
is
disabled
now.
his
head
was
bandaged
on
the
very
day
of
the
trial
four
years
later
when
he'd
been
over
at
the
hospital
and
shortly
before
that
had
to
and
had
to
have
a
drainage
taken
from
his
head.
so
the
man
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
the
fact
that
the
man
was
completely
overreached.
but
i
don't
think
that's
necessarily
the
point
because
the
--
we
meet
right
off
the
point
that
he
wasn't
given
a
full
explanation
of
his
rights
and
he
wasn't
given
fair
treatment.
now,
incidentally
on
that
--
my
time
is
getting
short,
there
is
one
feature
i
want
to
call
the
honors'
attention.
if
you
look
at
the
fact
of
the
record,
i
think
as
a
matter
of
fact,
back
of
the
major
part
of
the
record
there
at
page
347a,
those
are
the
text
of
the
release.
i
think
this
release
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
void
on
its
face
because
it
recites
here
--
mr.
charles
a.
ellis
347a
of
this
--
it's
the
circuit
court
record.
your
honors
granted
an
order
allowing
this
appeal
without
turning
up
the
record
here,
its
right
at
the
back
your
honor.
about
--
yes,
it's
the
last
thing
in
this
--
in
the
record,
that
last
thing
that
is
in
defendant
part.
now
you'll
notice
it
starts
out,
it's
headed
up
the
top
release
of
all
rights
and
recovery.
by
the
way
a
lot
of
this
is
red
print,
some
of
it
is
black
print
and
all
caps
and
so
forth.
and
then
it
says
by
signing
this
release
you
give
up
every
rights
you
have.
and
william
thompson,
age
56
so
forth
in
an
exchange
for
the
sum
of
$4000
less
the
sum
of
$550
which
has
been
previously
paid
to
me.
now
by
the
way
let
me
interrupt
there
just
one
moment
there
is
no
word
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
he
got
$550,
the
utmost
i
can
find
is
$450,
that
--
including
$100
--
the
$300
that
was
advanced
to
him
to
go
to
arkansas,
$100
advanced
to
him
to
make
the
trip
to
attend
the
trial
of
medina,
and
$50
that
was
advanced
to
him
at
his
specific
request.
then
this
goes
on,
it
says,
which
i
received
do
hereby
release
and
forever
discharge
coastal
company
and
the
several
vessels
in
particular
rosina
marron,
the
owners
and
so
forth
from
our
own
account
of
injuries
or
illnesses
suffered
by
me
as
follows.
the
injuries,
illness
alleged
to
have
been
sustained
by
me
and/or
illnesses
alleged
to
have
been
incurred
and
contracted
by
me
while
i
was
in
the
service
of
the
said
steamship
rosina
marron
on
or
about
january
30,
1950
and
or
at
any
time
or
times.
and
in
addition
to
that
i
release
them
from
each
and
every
right
or
claim
which
i
now
have
or
may
here
have
to
have
because
of
any
matter
or
thing
which
happened
before
signing
this
paper.
it
being
my
intention
--
notice
the
last
line
there,
even
as
respects,
injuries,
illnesses
rights
and
claims
not
mentioned
herein
or
not
known
to
me.
now,
how
can
a
release
covering
rights
not
known
to
the
seamen
on
his
face
stating
to
be
rights
not
known
to
the
seamen
be
nevertheless
a
release
of
rights
which
the
seaman
fully
understands.
and
if
--
if
there
is
a
release
here
of
rights
not
known
to
the
seaman
how
can
any
part
of
that
$4000
consideration
be
attributed
anymore
to
the
release
of
rights
that
were
known
if
there
were
any,
actually
known
and
then
to
the
rights
that
aren't
known.
then
it
goes
on
down
before
and
below,
read
the
following
six
numbered
statements
carefully.
i
know
this
paper
is
much
more
than
we
see
it
as
release.
i
am
giving
up
every
right
i
have,
now
why
have
a
right
if
the
man
is
supposed
to
have
a
full
understanding
of
his
rights
and
it's
supposed
to
deal
with
his
tort.
then
it
goes
on
in
making
up
my
mind
to
this
release,
i
am
using
my
own
judgment
without
regard
to
anything
that
has
been
told
to
me
by
anybody.
he's
entitled
to
rely
on
the
representations
made
to
him
by
these
parties
that
seek
the
release.
that
i
know
that
in
signing
this
release
i
am
among
other
things
now
settling
in
for
--
for
all
injuries,
illnesses
and
disabilities
i
have
had
already,
which
i
have
now
or
which
i
may
have
in
the
future.
either
because
of
--
either
because
of
the
particular
occurrence
mentioned
above
or
because
of
any
other
occurrence
in
the
past
or
because
of
both,
even
though
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
had
already,
have
not
or
may
have,
have
now
or
i
may
in
the
future
such
injuries,
illnesses
or
disabilities
and
even
though
they
are
mentioned
particularly
in
this
release.
and
i
do
all
this
regardless
of
what
anyone
may
have
told
me
about
my
injuries,
illnesses
or
disabilities
or
about
anything
else.
then
it
goes
on
regardless
of
what
anyone
may
have
told
me
i
release
also
--
i
realize
also
that
my
injuries
may
be
worse
than
they
seem
to
be.
i
am
now
settling
for
that
also.
down
below
or
rather
a
neat
feature
you'll
notice
(a),
answer
to
either
where
they
asked
him
what
--
what
are
you
doing
and
they
tell
him
what
to
sign.
we
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
release
is
invalid
that
there
was
liability
in
the
circuit
courts
should
be
reversed.
