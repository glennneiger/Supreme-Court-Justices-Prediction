did
the
court

upset
to

the

and
did
the
court
--
and
did
the
district
court
find
as
a
fact
that
the
injured
man
had
been
induced
to
sign
the
release,
put
an
adequate
sum
by
the
agent
of
the
shipping
company
the
two
statements
that
were
wrong,
one
of
fact
and
one
of
law,
is
that
what

the

(voice

they
say
that
that
the
result
of
this,
incorrect.
no

--
not
intentional
default
statements
of
both
facts
and
law
to
thompson.
this
man
unrepresented
by
counsel
without
any
independent
medical
advices
on
signing
for
release.
and
it
is
clear
that
defendant's
agent
in
insisting
that
thompson's
is
practically
well
did
induce
thompson
to
sign
the
release
for
the
inadequate
sum.
was
that
upset
in
any
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
held
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
but
they
did
not
upset,
his
findings
of
fact
did
it,
to
the
effect
that
this
release
had
been
induced
by
misstatements,
not
intentionally
false
both
as
to
the
extent
of
the
injuries
and
the
adequacy
of
the
amount
and
as
to
the
--

and
as
to
the
fact

liability.
justice

and
that
we
have
to
accept
that,
do
we
not?
because
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
it
and
therefore,
we'd
reach
the
question.
do
we
not,
as
to
whether
when
a
man,
a
seaman
without
lawyer
has
been
induced
to
sign
a
release
by
the
claim
agent
who
not
--
who
honestly,
we
say
honestly
but
not
--
not
dishonest,
but
honestly
makes
two
misstatements
to
the
man.
one,
it's
got
a
weak
case
under
the
law
and
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
--
and
the
other
that
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
practically
well.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
use
that
language
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
that's
what
the
court
found
from
the
facts.
we
have
to
accept
that,
do
we
not?
it
hadn't
been
upset
for
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
so,
we
--
we
reached
the
question
as
to
whether
release
signed
under
those
conditions,
statements
were
made
that
were
not
correct,
both
of
fact
and
of
law
to
a
man
like
this
without
a
lawyer,
whether
that
as
a
question
of
law,
it
should
set
aside
the
release.
that's
the
dispute
--
that's
the
difference
between
a
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
is
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
statement
by
the
district
court
correct
and
has
it
been
upset
in
any
event,
that
thompson
settled
a
conference
for
barron
latter
or
defendants
or
other
agent
told
thompson
of
this
prognosis
of
dr.farr
now
found
to
be
incorrect
and
it
has
been
found
to
be
incorrect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
did
the
court
of
appeals
upset
this
finding
of
the
district
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
now
--
now,
let
us
go
on.
and
barron
refused
to
consider
any
greater
settlement
figure
than
$4000
because
he
insisted
to
thompson
that
thompson
was
practically
well
then.
barron
admits
that
if
he
hadn't
then
known
that
dr.farr's
prognosis
was
incorrect
and
that
thompson's
future
would
be
serious,
as
it
has
now
turned
out
to
be.
he
would
not
have
evaluated
his
case
at
$4000,
but
would
have
told
thompson
to
get
a
lawyer
before
he
settle.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
--
what
you
have
isn't
it,
a
finding
of
fact
by
the
district
judge
that
this
man
did
make
his
statement,
which
was
not
true,
but
which
he
thought
was
true
and
that
that
induced
this
man
without
his
lawyer
to
sign
the
release.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
held
that
even
though
without
offsetting
that
time
that
even
though
this
statement
was
made
and
was
not
correct.
it
was
an
honest
misstatement
and
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
release
wouldn't
be
set
aside
while
making
an
honest
mistake
of
the
fact,
even
though
it
abused
the
man
to
settle
his
case
with
an
adequate
sum.
