mr.
silas
blake
axtell
the
court
please.
nearly
40
years
ago
when
i
first
appeared
in
this
court
for
a
sailor.
i've
been
working
for
seaman
for
eight
years
before
that
exclusively
and
have
continued.
this
case
is
one,
very
difficult
to
discuss
and
i'm
going
to
refrain.
i'm
going
into
details
as
to
what
caused
the
injury
to
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
was
born
in
georgia,
1892.
speaking
of
his
education,
he
said
that
if
i
must
answer
that
question,
i
have
to
tell
you
that
the
facilities
for
colored
people
in
georgia
when
i
was
a
boy
were
very
inadequate.
but
learning,
i
had
since
i
gotten
on
the
ships
and
running
around.
the
man,
william
thompson
was
a
tall,
very
strong
person
of
normal
outlook
upon
life,
and
a
competent
cook,
have
been
a
chief
cook
and
assistant
chief
cook.
he
signed
out
not
ago
on
this
ship
and
marron,
rosina
marron
they
called
her
of
the
coastal
oil
company.
on
december
1st,
1949,
he
was
injured
on
the
12th
of
january,
some
52
days
after
he
had
joined
the
ship.
if
your
honors
would
examine,
the
appellee's
record
and
brief
in
the
original
court
at
--
you'll
turn
to
page
42,
43,
45,
and,
particularly,
47
you
will
see
a
corroboration
by
the
chief
steward
of
the
vessel
of
the
very,
very
serious
charges
made
by
thompson
to
the
delegates
of
the
ship.
when
i
began
for
seaman,
we
didn't
have
unions
to
the
extent
they
have
them
now,
we
had
a
union
but
it
was
a
poor
thing
so
that
it's
a
chief
attorney
and
its
chief
president
or
officer
and
(inaudible)
came
to
me,
the
boy
in
charge
of
the
seaman,
the
branch
of
the
legal
aid
society
for
a
legal
advice
because
it
didn't
cost
anything
but
he
made
the
slave
of
me
while
he
made
free
men
of
the
sailors.
the
man,
thompson,
revolted
that
what
he
had
seen.
he
went
down
the
alley
way
to
get
some
men
to
play
poker.
he
had
a
--
he
love
playing
poker.
he
opened
the
door,
what
he
saw
was
so
terrible
especially
as
there
was
an
extra
man
in
the
room
with
the
three
offenders.
he
reported
it
to
chief
steward
immediately.
schiffers
whose
testimony
we
took.
we
took
his
testimony
after
he
had
been
examined
by
the
defendants
in
the
case.
they
didn't
know
what
his
testimony.
they
didn't
even
want
his
statement,
as
that
appears
in
the
record.
schiffers
did
nothing.
he
did
nothing
when
he
saw
what
he
had
seen
two
months
before
this
--disaster.
the
master
knew
it,
the
chief
mate
knew
it,
they
all
knew
it.
they
tolerated
it,
a
condition
that's
intolerable.
as
a
father
of
six
sons,
i
think,
it's
a
matter
of
public
interest
for
all
of
us,
ashore
or
on
the
sea.
such
people
should
be
controlled
or
eliminated
from
contact
with
others.
they
had
delegates,
one
for
the
deck
department,
one
for
the
engine
room
department,
one
for
the
steward
department.
we
took
the
testimony
of
kaplus.
his
testimony
appears
also
in
this
appellee's
additional
record.
kaplus
verified
but
the
plaintiff
had
said
he
was
present
at
the
hearing
of
the
three
delegates,
the
next
evening,
the
night
of
january
13th,
the
night
of
the
attempted
murder.
this
horrible
thing
allowed
to
walk
of
three
amongst
men,
born
in
cuba
didn't
want
to
leave
the
ship.
he'd
worked
into
four
or
five
months.
he
like
the
job
and
his
associates
or
referred
as
in
another
name,
i
won't
mention.
at
the
meeting,
young,
the
chief
pumpman
and
the
ship's
chairman
as
they
call
it,
said,
"what
do
you
got,
thompson?
you
have
no
witness
to
corroborate
you.
you're
all
alone.
what
can
you
do?"
he
said,
"well,
i
demand
that
these
men
leave
the
ship."
they
could
have
called
it
the
attention
of
a
coast
guard.
i
don't
suppose
they
knew
about
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
but
it
was
a
union
affair
and
they
were
going
to
quash
it.
get
rid
of
the
men
in
his
own
way.
this
one
man,
a
negro
from
georgia,
born
in
1892
with
characteristics
that
you
and
i
should
emulate.
he
alone
challenged
these
three
horrible
things
together
with
the
man
who
was
a
witness
to
it
in
that
room,
alone.
and
he
said,
"what
can
we
do?
where's
your
evidence?
where
is
your
corroboration?"
they
didn't
call
the
chief
steward
to
say
what
he
saw
two
months
earlier
and
everybody
else
saw
in
that
ship.
what
did
the
murderer
do?
he
was
heard
by
kaplus,
i
referred
to
it
in
our
brief,
to
have
said,
"i'll
kill
that."
as
of
the
--
he
went
and
got
the
key
from
the
chief
cook
and
went
into
the
galley
and
got
a
cleaver
of
the
weight
of
this
but
more
the
size
of
this
one,
in
the
left,
both
of
which
were
in
evidence
at
the
trial.
he
waited
in
an
alleyway
in
a
dark
place
and
when
thompson
came
by
alone.
he
stood
behind
him
and
we
was
not
a
small
man
and
came
down
on
thompson,
hit
like
that,
twice,
third
time.
braising
only
the
scalp
but
the
two
blows
penetrated
both
tables
of
his
skull.
the
man
fell,
moaning
to
the
deck,
i'm
--
i'm
dead
--
i'm
dead.
his
instinct
then
lapsing
consciousness
permitted
that.
had
he
not
had
that
native
wit,
that
fiend
will
chop
him
from
the
top
of
his
face
and
head
until
he
was
dead.
why?
they
say
$4000
was
a
reasonable
compensation
for
that.
i
would
say
that
if
there
was
no
injury
to
endure
such
an
experience
with
a
life
of
serving
in
the
ships
ahead.
man,
you
even
work
for
45
years
already.
he
had
a
few
years
left,
to
see
a
meat
cleaver
daily
in
his
work
is
sufficient
cause
for
the
neurosis
from
which
he
suffered.
now,
getting
down
to
the
law
of
this
thing.
the
circuit
court
reversed.we
asked
for
re-argument
immediately
or
in
that
court,
to
grant
it.
judge
biggs
of
delaware,
judge
mclaughlin
of
new
jersey
dissented
and
their
findings
were
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
law
as
established
by
this
great
court
in
garrett
against
moore-mccormack.
the
other
five
judges,
hastie,
staley,
maris,
well
in
any
rate,
they're
all
from
pennsylvania.
i'm
certainly
i
do
not
imply
that
this
is
a
conspiracy
from
pennsylvania
to
reinstate
what
you
disallowed
and
overruled
in
the
garrett
case.
the
garrett
case
was
a
pennsylvania
case.
if
you
have
time
to
look
at
the
decision,
you
then
reversed.
you
will
find
there
the
statement
that
in
this
state,
there
has
never
been
a
court
of
chancery.
our
equity
is
administered
by
our
courts
at
common
law.
and
you
will
find
that
there
is
ingrained
in
that
procedure,
the
proposition
that
the
burden
of
proving
the
release,
rests,
proving
there
to
us
that
the
relief
should
be
set
aside
rest
upon
the
man's
seeking
to
set
is
aside.
in
our
federal
court,
the
rule
is
the
opposite.
the
burden
is
upon
the
man
who
defends
release
in
this
case
for
$4000.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
a
member
and
a
(inaudible)
union
for
whom
i
was
counsel
for
all
my
life,
until
it
went
out
of
their
business
under
the
drive
of
the
communist
horde.
he
was
one
of
those
men
that
union
men
called
"company
men".
read
if
you
have
time,
the
letters
that
he
wrote
to
the
company,
beginning.
telling
about
how
he
was
annoyed
by
lawyers
who
wanted
to
give
him
advice.
he
pushed
him
away.
i
think
they
shouldn't
have
been
there.
but
what
are
we
going
to
do?
the
law
schools
are
pouring
him
out
with
thousands.
what
are
they
going
to
do?
do
we
have
to
revert
to
marxian
compensation?
marxian
compensation
to
avoid
this
thing,
i
hope
not.
he
was
a
company
man.
he
sought
to
ingratiate
himself
in
the
minds
of
his
employer,
mr.
mahoney.
he
told
them
how
bad
he
felt
but
he's
going
to
get
well
and
he
was
going
to
go
back
to
save
his
job
on
the
rosina
marron.
and
when
he
transferred
from
one
hospital
to
another,
three
of
them
in
the
south,
i
believe,
finally
appearing
in
the
district
court
for
the
trial
of
the
culprit.
the
first
trial
was
a
mistrial
and
second
trial
resulted
in
a
plea
of
guilty.
the
coast
guard
had
gotten
rid
of
him,
gone
back
to
his
native,
cuba.
at
any
rate,
the
man
is
a
nervous
wreck,
his
work
is
true
but
he
has
told
us
of
his
suffering.
i
personally
prepared
this
case
for
trial.
i
was
present
when
it
was
tried
except
for
the
time
when
barron,
the
conjecture
was
questioned
and
said
that
he
had
told
mr.
thompson
about
dr.farr's
report
that
he
had
only
a
10%
permanent
disability.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
well,
the
difference
is
that
the
plaintiff
was
under
impression
that
he
was
well.
there
is
an
article
here
in
the
saturday
post
last
week
on
schizophrenics
that
is
in
enlightening.
these
--
these
men,
they
get
to
be
very
up
buoyant,
optimistic,
then
they
go
down.
this
man
borrowed
$50
from
men
in
the
hospital
in
new
york.
he
got
$100
more
and
then
went
to
their
office
and
got
$300
to
go
to
arkansas
to
get
hot
baths,
so
he
feels
better.
he
came
back
feeling
fine,
was
sent
to
dr.farr
for
the
second
time
--
no,
the
first
time.
and
they
came
back
optimistic.
the
hospital
record
said
he
was
practically
cured
and
nothing
wrong
with
him.
the
hospital
record
shows
encephalopathy
of
the
brain
by
trauma.he
thought
he
was
cured
and
he
had
lost
about
$2000
in
maintenance
and
wages.
they
were
giving
him
$2000
extra.
he
would
go
into
work.
but
when
he
returned
to
work
and
he
had
to
use
this
meat
axe
and
the
heat
of
the
galley,
he
found
hot
flashes
on
his
head.
he
imagined
it
in
a
place
where
he
was
injured.
completely
nervous,
unable
to
stay
at
any
job
more
than
a
little
while,
rushing
on
--
i
never
forget
the
time
when
he
would
--
in
my
office
waiting
for
the
trial
if
he
could
get
it
over.
we
pressed
for
trial.
they
opposed.
finally,
on
condition
we
waive
a
jury.
they
said
they've
tried
the
case.
they
had
one
of
these
offenders,
his
deposition
in
court.
he
denied
everything
of
course.
the
injury
is
very
serious.
we
felt
as
lawyers
if
the
court
gave
him
in
$20,000
not
more
than
half
what
he
might
have
but
that
figure
was
one
the
plaintiff
had
fixed
for
himself
in
his
negotiation
to
these
underwriters.
and
they
have
said,
"but
you're
all
right
now."
as
you
read
the
waters
case
we've
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
(inaudible)
case,
you
will
find
--
excuse
me.
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
waters
case.
the
chief
engineer
settled
his
case
for
$1000,
the
united
states
government,
and
tuberculosis.
he
had
complained
of
unseaworthy
conditions
and
that
the
crew
were
incompetent.
and
he
as
chief
engineer
had
to
spend
so
much
time
rushing
in
and
out
of
the
engine
room
long
hours,
with
no
opportunity
to
rest,
that
he
developed
the
tuberculosis.
that
man
presumably
intelligent,
fairly
well-educated,
settled
his
case
for
a
$1000.
the
district
court
sustained
the
release.
the
circuit
court,
the
very
learned
opinion
by
judge
bone
reversed
the
district
court.
i
want
to
--
you
bear
with
me,
how
much
time
i
got
here?
i
--
i'm
unaware
of
the
time
could
--
five
minutes
more?
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
yes,
thank
you.
this
thing
really
began,
these
releases,
we
called
them
red,
white
and
blue
releases.
it
takes
so
long
to
fill
them
out.
they
haven't
been
going
along
that
to
vernon
jones
who
got
his
early
training
in
my
office
way
back
in
19
--
had
got
acquainted
with
the
sailors.
(inaudible)
office
that
they
got
the
people
took
him
over.
and
he
designed
this
release
which
the
man
has
to
write
out
and
go
back
and
repeat
something
he's
five
or
six
lines
or
questions
about.
to
prove
beyond
any
doubt,
he
knows
what
he's
getting.
to
release
--
he
is
releasing
all
that
he
knows
about
and
all
that
he
hasn't
known
about
that
doctors
make
mistakes
and
everybody
makes
mistakes.
but
regardless
of
that,
he's
signing
off
his
rights
entirely.
now,
i've
been
to
sea
myself
enough
to
know
that
the
change
in
economic
condition
of
the
seaman
which
has
been
suggested
here
as
a
reason
for
this
sustaining
the
circuit
court
is
not
a
reason.
a
man
doesn't
change
his
thinking
or
attitude
toward
the
land
and
its
people
because
he
gets
more
money
for
the
risk
of
his
life
and
the
denial
of
happiness
that
follows
the
sea
life.
it
doesn't
change
a
bit.
i
remember
on
1919,
ordinary
seaman
on
the
west
(inaudible)
when
we
came
to
the
panama
canal
and
we've
been
aboard
that
ship
for
several
weeks.
i
couldn't
get
ashore
quick
enough.came
back
to
the
vessel
and
a
bunch
of
bananas
on
my
shoulder,
i've
gone
back
to
the
second
one
because
somebody
had
stolen
the
first
one.
walked
down
some
planks
and
jumped
on
to
the
deck.
that
is
no
proof
of
incompetence,
i
hope,
but
i
do
say
that
a
sailor,
to
get
his
money
will
say
"i
believe
you"
and
he
--
he
does
believe
him
and
he
signs
and
he
signed
anything.
so,
the
mere
language
of
the
release
should
be
disregarded.
the
first
case
was
a
case
of
(inaudible),
boy
from
that
island
in
the
mediterranean
--
what
is
it?
the
one
the
british
are
holding
down
there.
he
had
hurt
his
shoulder
in
the
icebox
of
a
standard
oil
tanker.
he'd
signed
a
release
for
$87.50,
maintenance
and
cure.
the
case
came
in
before
judge
conger
who
hadn't
been
on
the
bench
long.
i
decided
to
withdraw
the
indemnity
allegation
because
i
have
felt
that
to
prove
that
there
was
negligence
under
the
jones
act,
just
because
ice
accumulated
on
the
deck
of
a
refrigerator
wasn't
a
very
strong
case.
but
the
evidence
showed
that
the
versa
which
had
been
calcified
and
shown
so
by
the
x-ray
had
cleared
up
under
treatment.
and
he
went
back
to
work
after
signing
the
release
and
then
he
found
he
had
to
go
back
to
the
hospital,
the
calcification
had
returned
to
the
shoulder.
the
hospital
and
the
company
doctor
made
a
mistake.
the
judge,
he
gave
him
in
those
days
that
wasn't
much
as
1938,
$228
in
maintenance
to
make
up
for
the
additional
time
that
he
was
laid
out.
the
court
here
has
in
our
briefs,
about
five
of
them,
all
the
law
there
is
on
this
subject.
all
we
ask
is
this
that
you
give
careful
consideration
to
the
original
case
that
i
submitted
to
judge
conger,
harden
against
gordon
4027,
federal
cases
1823,

of
lords
in
england
mentioned
in
our
brief
in
the
circuit
court
on
appellee's
addition
to
the
record.
1825,
you
find
them.
i
don't
see
any
evidence
they
knew
about
judge
story's
decision
in
1823.
but
the
similarity
is
there
and
it
--
it
should
be
observed
today.
most
unfortunate
would
it
be
to
take
a
man
like
this
who's
already
suffering
from
a
neurosis
and
aggravation.
and
add
to
it,
the
frustration
of
defeat
after
this
long
battle.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
well,
on
the
ground
that
there
was
a
mistake
as
to
the
extent
of
injury.
the
man
approached
the
thing,
he
was
optimistic,
he
wanted
to
be
--
he
wanted
the
end
of
thing.
he
wanted
his
money.
there
wasn't
any
fraud.
there
wasn't
any
duress.
but
there
was
a
mistake
and
the
mistake
was
inherent
in
an
injury
he
had
sustained.
you
read
the
testimony
of
dr.samberg
in
the
record.
now,
we
call
dr.
samberg
specialist,
one
of
the
leading
men
in
america
who
happened
to
be
the
consultant
at
the
marine
hospital
where
this
man
was
a
patient.
they
called
dr.
farr,
the
yale
medical
school
who
is
a
surgeon.
i've
known
dr.
farr
for
ever
since
i
began
the
practice
of
law,
classmate
of
theory
of
the
burlingame
firm,
great
picture
on
yale,
1903.
well,
he
is
a
kindly
man.
he
says
that
10%
total
disability,
the
judge
in
the
record
says
"well,
if
this
man
isn't
hurt
worse
than
10%,
i'm
no
judge."
read
the
list
of
statutes
where
i
point
to
where
judge
hartshorne
questions
the
plaintiff,
questions
down,
the
man
who
took
the
release.
questions
dr.
farr
and
questions
dr.
samberg.
he
took
the
trial
away
from
counsel.
they
didn't
call
mr.
thompson
back
to
rebut
the
statement
that
he'd
been
told
about
the
10%
because
i
was
in
an
naturalization
court
hearing
an
eloquent
address
to
new
citizens
when
i
couldn't
be.
mr.
gleason,
the
lawyer
who
were
trying
it
was
alone.
however,
take
the
judge's
conclusion
and
then
i
ask
you
this.
the
mcallister
case
by
judge
minton,
you
recall
the
question.
how
did
he
get
the
polio?
was
it
from
the
open
latrine
on
the
deck
where
the
chinese
longshoremen
were
brought
or
permitted
or
was
it
from
a
visit
ashore?
who
could
tell?
science
had
no
answer.
the
judge
decided
who
was
he?
it
was
judge
hincks
who'd
been
on
the
bench
40
years
or
more
conscientious
fine
man.
he
decided
the
facts.
does
your
--
do
your
honors,
want
a
succession
of
appeals
like
this
or
do
you
consider
if
expedient
and
proper
in
this
time
to
follow
the
doctrine
of
the
mcallister
case
which
has
been
followed
in
all
the
circuits
practically
to
get
rid
of
these
disputed
questions
of
fact.
this
trial
is
de
novo,
were
invented,
i
presume
by
expediency
like
when
the
early
cases
i
tried
in
philadelphia
where
i
had
a
mistrial
because
i
mentioned
to
the
jury
the
amount
we're
going
to
sue
for
or
asking
for,
a
rule
peculiar
to
philadelphia.
that
had
a
reason
--
i
presume
in
a
similar
railroad
case
where
there
was
no
other
way
to
reverse
the
plaintiff.
now,
you
then
have
the
situation.
allow
the
federal
judge
to
be
the
guardian
of
the
court
and
the
law
says
he
is.
let
him
have
it.
let
the
man
appeal
to
him.
if
he
decides
against
the
man
that
ends
it,
should
end
it.
if
he
decides
the
other
way,
it
probably
will
end
it
to.
let
him
have
that
but
why
should
the
circuit
court
intervene
and
bring
in
ancient
myths
from
pennsylvania
about
equity
and
the
burden
of
proof
especially
when
they're
in
direct
conflict
with
the
stated
policy
of
this
court.
garrett
against
moore-mccormack
is
the
law.
it
has
been
correctly
applied
by
judge
hartshorne
and
it
had
been
misapplied
by
this
circuit
court,
the
third
circuit.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i
understand
i
have
a
moment
and
i
think
it's
quite
important.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
i
think
it's
quite
important
that
i
speak
concerning
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
judge
hand
made
what
we
--
what
a
lot
of
people
thought
was
new
law
in
the
keen
case.
he
did
not.
he
said
he
used
the
words
res
integra.
but
the
truth
is
that
he
overlooked
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
ross
case
reported
299
f.2d.
your
honor,
chief
justice,
remember
henry
(inaudible)
of
california,
attorney
of
the
old
sailors'
union
of
the
pacific,
the
case
of
(inaudible),
the
mate
was
notorious
as
a
bruiser
he
had
(inaudible)
and
he
drove
this
man
around
and
beat
him.
beat
him
so
that
he
blinded
him.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
it
does.
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
well,
that
was
the
law
--
mr.
silas
blake
axtell
--
when
they
settle
this
case
and
it
was
their
duty
to
know
it.
