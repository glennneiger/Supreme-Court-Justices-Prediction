mr.
axtell,
what
do
you
consider
the
legal
ground
to
be
on
which
this
release
should
be
set
aside?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
turned
--
it
turned
out
however,
did
it
not
that
the
representations
that
were
made
by
barron
as
to
the
difficulties
of
this
case
because
he
thought
the
unseaworthiness
rule
--
unseaworthiness
rule
would
not
apply
were
mistaken
although,
being
(voice
overlap)
isn't
he?
justice
john
m.
harlan
leave
--
leave
out
the
medical
aspects
and
address
yourself,
if
you
will
please
to
the
question,
the
legal
aspects
the
question
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
reach.
they
didn't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
didn't
reach
the
seaworthiness
question
and
therefore,
i
suppose
if
we
reverse
this
case.
we
probably
send
it
back
for
him
and
consider
that
question,
wouldn't
it?
or
it
would
be
solely
might
do
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
we
got
up
here
at
this
stage
is
the
validity
of
the
release.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
you
don't
have
to
take
how
many
times
on
that.
i
agree
with
you
on
that
point.
i'd
like
to
put
this
specific
question
or
because
--
perhaps,
i
haven't
made
myself
clear.
the
rule
of
law
as
it
was
understood
at
the
time
this
release
was
made
was
that
the
unseaworthiness
doctrine
did
not
apply
to
this
sort
of
a
situation.
is
that
right?
that
was
before
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
the
keen
case
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
the
representation,
however,
innocent
he
was
assuming
that
(voice
overlap)
was
to
the
effect
that
this
man
had
a
difficult
case
because
he
would
have
to
prove
under
the
jones
act
the
seaworthiness
doctrine
not
being
applicable,
that
the
shipowner
knew
that
this
man
was
a
homosexual,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
what
about
a
rule
of
law
in
this
seaman's
cases
or
let
me
ask
you
one
preliminary
question.
does
the
shipowner
knew
that
this
man
did
not
have
a
lawyer,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
you
say
to
a
rule
of
law
in
the
seaman's
cases
that
if
a
shipowner
knowing
that
a
seaman
has
not
got
a
lawyer
makes
a
representation
as
to
the
law
that
he
does
so
with
his
own
risk?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
the
law
--
the
question
of
whether
the
seaworthiness
rule
applied
if
you
were
representing
this
seaman
would
have
a
great
bearing
as
to
the
strength
of
his
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
exactly.
and
therefore
--
oh,
therefore,
i
suggest
that
when
the
steamship
company
knows
that
it
is
dealing
with
a
man
who
is
not
represented
by
a
lawyer.
is
it
an
unattainable
proposition
of
law
to
say
that
in
this
seaman's
cases,
if
he
chooses
to
make
a
representation
as
to
the
law
however
innocent,
however
good
faith,
he
has
to
stand
at
all
on
the
risk,
take
the
risk?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
talking
about
seaman's
cases
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
anything
else.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
all
he
has
to
do
is
not
to
say
anything
on
the
law.
i'm
assuming
that
this
release
had
this
representative
of
yours,
mr.
barron
said
nothing
about
the
law
would
have
been
a
perfectly
valid
release
because
i
agree
with
you
myself
that
the
question
of
each
of
the
mistake
on
the
medical
evidence
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you're
right
on
that.
