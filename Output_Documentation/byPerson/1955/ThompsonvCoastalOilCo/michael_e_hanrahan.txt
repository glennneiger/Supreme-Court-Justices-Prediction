mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i'd
like
to
preface
my
remarks
with
this.
i
think
your
honors
might
know
that
in
the
eastern
and
southern
districts
particularly
in
around
new
york
city
the
greater
part
of
the
litigation
that
was
on
there,
seamen
claims
but
probably
10
times
or
perhaps
a
dozen
times
that
many
are
claims
that
are
settled
directly
between
seamen
and
shipowner.
and
these
shipowners
are
well
versed
in
this
court's
ruling
in
garrett
against
moore-mccormack.
they
know
that
the
seaman
has
to
be
fairly
treated
so
that
the
--
that
the
settlement
will
stand
up.
and
i
think
that
if
the
release
as
we
present
the
facts
in
my
brief
here,
for
the
thorough
reading
of
the
record
set
aside,
there's
going
to
be
no
alternative
to
shipowners
but
to
cancel
their
entire
adjusting
departments
some
--
and
ask
a
court
approval
on
a
every
settlement.
i
mean
these
are
the
facts
that
as
they
stack
up,
the
seaman
went
to
four
marine
hospitals
on
the
state's
public
healthcare
hospitals
following
the
assault.
galveston,
corpus
christi,
new
orleans
and
finally
the
hospital
at
stapleton,
staten
island
and
he
was
discharged
there
on
april
28th,
1950.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
no,
well
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i've
often
thought
your
honor
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
pretrial
hearing
but
still
that
would
clutter
the
judge's
work.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
no.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
but
what
--
that
--
i
think
one
of
the
most
important
factors
here
is
while
this
fellow
was
in
the
marine
hospital
and
before
he
signed
a
release,
he
were
--
there
were
12
to
16
lawyers
approached
him
in
the
marine
hospitals
and
he
turned
all
those
down.
now,
there's
seven
or
eight
letters
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
what
i
as
an
attorney
for
the
steamship
company?
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
of
course
not,
no.
are
we
supposed
to
--
suppose
to
go
to
that
far?
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
the
seaman
must
have
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
--
i
think
you
must
take
every
fact
into
consideration,
the
fact
that
he
had
the
--
the
garrett
rule
says
that
he
must
have
adequate
legal
and
medical
assistance.
he
must
have,
know
what
he
is
doing.
there
must
be
no
overreaching
and
there
was
none
of
that
here
because
he
came
to
the
company,
he
--
he
started
all
the
negotiations,
he
wrote
the
letters
and
he
went
to
sealing
&
jarvis
first
were
merely
agents
for
the
coastal
oil
company.
and
there,
his
--
nobody
talked
of
setting
the
case
first.
he
just
thought
he'd
be
better
off
if
he
went
down
to
hot
springs,
arkansas.
and
they
asked
him
how
much
money
he
wanted
and
he
said
$300
and
that
was
given
to
him.
and
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
no,
there
was
no
talk
of
settlement
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
no.
it
was
understood
--
well,
whether
--
i
doubt
it
was
understood
by
him
but
if
--
the
company
always
deducts
those
advances
from
the
final
settlement.
but
then
he
came
back
from
hot
springs
and
he
went
over
to
this
barron,
of
the
shipowner's
claims
bureau,
that
--
that's
a
group
where
they
have
several
claim
agents
that
represent
several
steamship
companies.
they
don't
maintain
their
own
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes,
they
do.
they
don't
have
a
legal
department,
they
have
a
fellow
on
the
--
what
was
it
called,
sort
of
a
counsel,
but
he's
not
licensed
to
practiced
law.
but
they
have
a
list
of
approved
seamen's
attorneys.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes,
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes,
there's
a
--
but
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
it
--
and
if
they
just
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
--
i'm
off
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
just
to
--
to
answer
your
question
i'll
get
off
the
main
theme
of
my
argument,
but
today
a
seaman
gets
booklets
put
on
the
ship
telling
them
what
is
right,
sir.
and
those
booklets
summarize
the
maritime
rule
with
respect
seaman.
he
gets
a
newspaper
every
week
and
then
in
the
newspaper,
there
are
published
the
large
verdicts
for,
you
know,
for
jones
act
verdicts.
he
has
this
counsel
that
sits
right
in
the
union
hall
who
refers
a
man
to,
well.
i
practice
in
new
york
city
and
i
imagine
there's
20
to
25
attorneys
of
law
firms
included
in
that
number
who
practice
exclusively
seamen's
claims.
and
--
i
may
--
we
don't
know,
but
i
presume
that
this
was
a
seamen's
lawyer
who
contacted
the
man
through
these
many
hospitals.
on
medical
advice
there's
no
question
that
he
had
adequate
medical
advice
because
he
had
the
best
and
the
most
impartial
united
states
public
health
service.
i
--
there's
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
the
court
here
the
fact
that
all
these
facts
have
been
gone
over
by
the
circuit
court
below.
i
just
wanted
to
bring
to
your
attention
that
at
first
when
we
argued
the
case
it
was
unanimously
upheld
that
the
release
was
valid.
then
there
was
a
rehearing
on
papers
in
the
rest,
and
it
was
seven
to
five,
five-to-two
of
seven
judges.
but
there
is
nothing
but
fairness
all
the
way
through
here.
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
bring
to
your
honor's
attention
that
there
was
no
overreaching
at
all.
and
above
all
the
amount
given
to
this
man
was
--
i
mention
cases
in
my
brief
showing
where
that
shock,
the
conscience
of
the
court,
they
offer
$90
or
$125
and
there
was
no
question
the
court
set
aside
such
a
release.
here,
of
course,
the
man
at
the
time
he
signed
the
release
if
there
was
no
liability
would
have
been
entitled
to
no
more
than
maintenance
and
cure
and
that
was
almost
a
nominal
figure
because
all
the
time
he
had
been
in
the
hospitals.
if
he
was
entitled
to
general
damages
under
liability
he'd
get
about
six
months
wages,
and
that'd
bring
about
1400,
he
was
getting
2500
--
$250
a
week.
i
think
that's
about
$1400
plus
the
$250
maintenance.
he
had
no
hospital
expenses
because
that
was
all
take
--
all
free
under
the
public
health
service.
now,
you
don't
settle
a
case
on
jury
verdicts
four
years
later
or
on
a
judge's
decision
four
years
later.
now,
on
the
liability
feature
this
man
at
the
time
he
--
of
the
release
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
the
--
all
sailors
get
treat
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
they
get
free
treatment
at
the
united
states
marine
hospitals.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes.
that's
never
included
in
any
settlement
because
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
if
under
circumstance
your
honor
a
seamen
can't
get
to
a
marine
hospital,
goes
into
a
private
hospital
then
that
bill
is
paid
by
the
shipowner,
but
what
these
fellows
do
if
they're
--
is
so
disabled
that
they
can't
get
off
that
ship
themselves,
i
mean,
if
the
ambulance
is
right
there
to
meet
the
ship
and
they
go
right
to
the
marine
hospital.
otherwise
the
discharge
slip
qualifies
him
to
enter
the
marine
hospital
where
they
have
the
slip
regular
form
from
the
master.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
that
--
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
i
think
that
the
big
thing
that
the
release
was
overruled
in
the
--
or
held
invalid
by
the
district
court
was
the
fact
that
the
man
made
such
an
impression
and
i
brought
it
down
in
cross
examination,
it
seems
out
of
order
to
bring
up
such
a
point
if
you
have
evidence
to
that
--
to
the
supreme
court.
but
i
did
make
that,
i
tried
the
case
myself
in
the
district
court
and
i
told
about
the
bandage
on
the
head.
i
made
the
fellow
admit
that
he
had
only
had
that
bandage
on
the
head
for
three
days
before
the
trial.
now,
as
the
damages
again,
he
never
went
to
the
marine
hospital
for
treatment
of
his
head.
i
bring
that
out
in
my
brief
and
beginning
at
--
i
marked
it,
beginning
at
328
of
this
brief
he
was
never
admitted
in
the
four
years
following
the
execution
of
the
release
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
328.
in
other
words
he
was
never
admitted
to
the
marine
hospital,
to
any
marine
hospital
for
a
treatment
relating
to
his
head
following
the
execution
of
the
release.
for
instance
on
320
(a)
we've
got
a
long
record
and
it's
--
if
you
look
over
on
320
(a)
--
321
(a)
you
see
the
release
duodenal
ulcer
and
urethritis.
then
over
in
322,
the
one
that
--
actually,
there
is
some
history
of
venereal
trouble
there.
i
want
to
call
--
hold
the
court's
time
up
on
these,
but
then
there
was
also
a
finding
that
he
didn't
work
at
the
rating
that
he
had
worked
before.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
show
in
the
brief
and
in
the
record
to
that
he
had
worked
at
ratings
even
higher
than
that
he
had
before.
he
was
second
cook
on
this
particular
voyage.
and
many
times
in
the
four
years
before
the
--
from
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
release
and
the
trial
of
this
action,
had
worked
as
chief
cook,
or
first
cook
and
as
i
said
the
bandage
on
the
head
was
a
part
of
the
dramatic
effects
you
might
say
of
trying
the
case.
i
have
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
no.
that's
an
important
thing
that
i
want
to
bring
out
too
that
when
--
when
the
seamen
meets
with
the
--
with
the
claim
agent
and
they
sit
down
and
by
the
way
i
quoted
the
actual
conversations
between
barron
and
the
claimant
here
in
my
brief
so
that
you
didn't
have
to
go
thumbing
through
the
--
this
record.
thompson
couldn't
tell
whether
a
court
or
a
jury
four
years
later
was
going
to
decide
in
his
favor
and
he
couldn't
decide
whether
they
were
going
to
get
$4000
or
more.
he
couldn't
know
that
two
years
later
judge
hand
was
going
to
decide
the
keen
case
which
was
summed
that
a
man
of
vicious
propensities
rendered
a
ship
unseaworthy.
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
couldn't
know
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
going
to
decide
just
the
opposite
until
that
court
came
up
to
this
court
where
they
held
that
the
ship
wasn't
unseaworthy
where
the
man
used
a
bottle.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
--
if
this
case
was
go
to
before
a
jury,
now
you
can't
tell,
you
can't
tell
what
a
jury
is
going
to
do.
they
might
like
thompson
and
they
--
or
they
might
like
medina
and
he
might
end
with
a
court.
so,
in
summary
your
honors
i
say
that
we
performed
our
duty
under
the
garrett
rule.
the
man
had
a
chance.
he
--
he
says
in
his
one
part
of
his
brief
that
there
were
lawyers
who
told
him
that
they
could
get
him
more
than
$16,
but
he
didn't
want
lawyers,
he
wanted
to
settle
the
case
himself.
he
had
all
available
medical
advice.
he
knew
all
the
way
through
just
what
his
condition
was
and
never
after
except
just
before
the
trial
was
he
treated
for
this
condition
of
the
head.
there
was
absolutely
no
overreaching.
he
was
the
one
who
started
the
negotiations
with
the
court
--
with
the
claim
agent.
and
i
think
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
they
obligated
--
the
release
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
april
28th
or
about
a
month
i'd
say.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
june
--
april
28th
to
june
2nd,
no
more
than
five
weeks.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
there's
another
important
thing
judge.
the
hospital
report
upon
discharge
said
prognosis,
good,
recommended
one
month's
convalescent.
barron,
the
claim
agent
had
as
a
part
of
the
regular
routine
called
in,
arranged
for
a
physical
examination
via
dr.
farr.
farr's
report
was
more
conserved
or
we
might
say
worse
than
the
marine
hospital.
he
didn't
say
prognosis,
but
he
said
this
man
is
going
to
have
a
10%
permanent
disability
and
barron
testified
that
he
read
that
to
the
man.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
he'd
been
going
to
sea
for
four
years.
he
had
used
lawyers
before.
he
had
executed
releases
before.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
district
court
judge
said,
in
my
brief
i
quote
it
on
page
20,
the
court
-
i
am
going
to
assume
in
the
absence
of
further
proof
that
the
man
knew
he
was
signing
a
release
when
he
signed
that
paper.
he
knew
what
a
release
was.
there
must
be
--
there
must
come
a
point
when
a
seamen's
release
is
valid.
it's
good
for
his
point
of
view
because
he
can
get
quick
settlement,
he
can
go
on
his
way,
it's
good
from
the
company
point
of
view.
and
that
won't
clutter
up
that
--
the
southern
and
eastern
districts,
and
the
districts
out
in
california
with
these
seamen's
cases.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please.
i
realized
that
my
task
is
to
sustain
this
release
and
to
urge
the
court
to
render
an
opinion
on
this
reargument.
reiterating
justice
black's
holding
in
the
garrett
case
so
that
the
maritime
industry
as
a
whole
has
--
who
are
looking
at
this
case
most
eagerly
had
something
to
determine
just
where
they
stand.
i
might
say
that
if
a
release
entered
into
one
of
the
circumstances
that
thompson
--
surrendering
thompson
release,
it
set
aside
here
that
the
whole
amicable
adjustment,
90%
of
the
seaman's
claims
today,
i'm
talking
about
today
and
a
few
years
ago
of
being
settled
out
of
court
that
are
quick
release
so
the
man
doesn't
have
to
wait
four
or
five
years
for
this
case
to
come
up
and
pay
attorney's
fees
and
doctor's
fees
and
so
forth.
before
--
before
going
into
a
brief
summary
of
the
facts,
i
think,
it's
just
important
to
--
for
the
--
my
further
argument
to
really
reiterate
the
three-fold
holding
of
the
garrett
case,
one
then,
i
admit
representing
the
steamship
company.
i
have
the
burden
of
proof
which
i
contend
was
sustained
when
the
circuit
court
reversed
the
district
court's
holding.
it's
clearly
erroneous
under
the
facts.
the
second
element
of
the
garrett
decision
was
that
we
must
prove
that
the
seaman
signed
the
release
with
a
full
understanding
of
his
rights.
and
the
third,
and
this
is
most
important,
i
think,
in
consideration
with
your
honor's
question,
the
mistake.
“the
adequacy
of
the
consideration
and
the
nature
of
the
legal
and
medical
advise
available
at
the
time
the
release
was
signed
are
ought
to
be
considered.”
just
by
hitting
highlights,
i
think,
it's
important
just
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
a
lot
seaman
has
changed
so
considerably
over
the
years.i
mean,
the
days
of
captain
bligh,
moby
dick
and
the
whipping
post
of
gun.
things
have
changed
considerably
since
mr.
axtell
has
--
have
been
representing
seaman.
i
saw
that
he
had
a
quote
that
he
published
and
his
one
published
by
the
attorney
for
the
national
maritime
union.
this
is
a
summary
for
the
seaman
of
--
of
what
the
law
is.
this
is
given
to
the
seaman.
there
is
no
question
here
for
instance
that
thompson
himself
had
executed
releases
before.
he's
let
us
knew
--
summarized
in
the
appendix
that
he
--
i
think
he
wrote
about
eight
of
them
to
the
company
and
telling
them
how
he
felt.
he
knew
we
had
these
headaches.
he
knew
he
had
a
triple
fracture
of
the
skull.
he
had
a
--
or
i
think,
the
record
indicates
close
to
a
dozen
office
of
legal
advice
to
--
to
represent
him,
but
he
chose
to
go
ahead
on
his
own.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
there
--
there
were
two
things.
whether
or
not
there
was
a
--
in
their
petition
for
rehearing
and
argue
about
the
mistake
on
the
medical
diagnosis.
in
other
words,
they
would
have
you
believe
that
the
validity
of
the
seaman's
release
was
dependent
upon
the
infallibility
of
a
medical
diagnosis.
i
say
that
on
the
medical
aspects
alone,
that
their
arguments
about
mistake
are
vague
and
hypothetical
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
all
right
--
all
right
now
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
the
case
was
decided
in
1950
before
the
second
circuit's
opinion
in
the
keen
case
and
this
court's
opinion
on
the
boudin
case.
the
third
circuit
when
--
have
reviewed
this
case
said
that
the
keen
and
boudin
cases
could
not
have
ex
post
fact
--
facto
effect.
my
argument
or
just
to
review
what
those
cases
held
there
--
they
held
that
notice
was
not
a
requirement
of
an
assailant's
vicious
propensities
as
long
as
he
in
fact
did
have
these
vicious
propensities
or
peristaltic
or
homicidal
maniac,
i
think,
was
the
one
involved
in
the
keen
case.
but
again,
i
say
if
--
if
even
this
law
is
considered
to
have
ex
post
facto
effect,
thompson
was
settling
a
case
of
questionable
liability.
this
was
a
civil
case.
they
could
have
had
a
jury
here.
there
was
no
telling
what
the
jury
would
have
done.
now,
we
--
we'll
admit
all
through
here
that
this
man,
medina
who
did
the
assaulting
was
a
feminine.
i
mean,
he
had
feminine
tendencies.
the
alleged
homosexual
act
that
preceded
the
assault
is
highly
disputed.
it's
disputed
all
through
the
record.
there's
only
the
--
the
libelant
himself
was
said
that
such
an
act
took
place,
but
as
this
court
can
go
so
far
as
to
hold
that
the
ship
is
unseaworthy
merely
because
an
effeminate
seaman
is
employed.
i
mean,
that
--
that
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
that's
true.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
the
defendant
there
--
yes.
that
would
have
been
a
question.
i
think
the
conclusion
of
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
ship
is
unseaworthy
merely
because
an
employee
is
an
effeminate
seaman.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
right.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i'll
admit
that.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
--
with
effeminate
with
gait
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
doubt.
i
am
being
practical
that
it
would
--
it
would
require
almost
the
psychiatric
determination
of
every
seaman
before
return
to
ship.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
no.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
don't
think
so.
not
mere
effeminateness.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
or
--
or
actual
homo
--
natural
homosexualist.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
i
--
i'm
really
not
prepared
to
answer
that
but
thinking,
as
i
stand
here
before
you,
it's
--
it's
a
disgusting
thing
to
normal
people,
but
whether
something
that
would
actually
affect
the
seaworthiness
of
a
ship.
i
mean
the
laws,
gone
into
homicidal
maniac.
i
--
i
don't
think
--
the
ship
would
actually
be
unseaworthy
if
it
had
such
a
--
a
man
on
board.
i
mean
that
the
seamen
are
known
for
their
--
their
wild
endeavors
ashore.
that
doesn't
affect
the
efficient
running
of
a
ship.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
even
if
there
was
a
proven
--
and
the
captain
had
noticed
of
a
homosexualist
that
affect
the
ship
seaworthiness,
to
do
what
it's
supposed
to
do.
but
again,
i'm
--
i'm
here
principally
to
--
to
sustain
a
release
for
$4000.
now,
$4000
is
not
one
of
these
old
releases
where
a
fellow
would
lose
a
finger
or
something
and
the
company
would
give
him
$15.
such
considerations
would
shot
the
conscience
of
the
court.
but
as
i
say,
at
the
time
thompson
signed
this
release,
he
had
the
choice
of
determining
whether
or
not
he
would
proceed
to
trial
before
a
jury
whether
it
was
perceived
in
admiralty
before
a
judge.
he
was
equipped
with
the
--
a
discharge
from
the
marine
hospital
itself.
i
--
i
would
like
to
get
back,
your
honor,
to
rule
out
any
question
of
mistake
of
medical
diagnosis
here
because
that
--
that
is
not
in
this
case.
when
he
was
discharged
months
before
his
signed
to
release
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
that's
right.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
right.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
right.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
right.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
such
as
a
--
a
proposition
taken
hypothetically
like
that
it
is
--
is
difficult
to
answer.
i
--
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
specific
representation.
if
the
company
represented
have
said
to
him
that
your
chances
is
one
out
of
a
hundred
above
the
collecting
on
--
on
this
that
the
law
is
stuck
against
you
and
it
was
--
it
was
really
strong
there.
i
--
i
think
that
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
i
--
i
think
if
a
--
it's
a
consideration
where
they
talked
about
the
pros
and
cons
and
as
here,
thompson
started
a
figure
of
1500
and
this
was
talked
about
and
it
considered
the
length
of
time.
he
have
to
wait
after
a
trial
and
possibilities
of
--
of
winning
the
case
because
even
though
the
law
might
have
been
a
mistake
it
would
be
before
a
jury
who
would
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes
--
yes,
because
the
keen
case
and
the
boudin
case
were
landmark
cases.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
i
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that's
under
todays
circumstances,
that's
pending
over
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
know
--
i
know.
i
mean,
with
the
--
with
the
way
the
seaman's
slot
has
been
approved,
besides
attorney's
actually
retained
by
the
unions.
they
have
counselors
on
the
staff
but
frequently
the
--
while
the
seaman's
in
the
hospital,
negotiations
will
be
done
by
a
representative
of
--
of
--
you
know
--
actually
works
in
the
office
of
the
s.i.u.
or
the
n.m.u.
we
handle
sort
of
the
whole
thing
for
them.
now,
to
expect
even
on
the
seaman's
case
with
the
facilities
they
have
available
today
to
expect
the
adjustor
for
the
company
who
was
a
layman
himself
to
give
him
an
adequate
brief
on
the
law
before
he
signs
the
releases
that
--
that
it's
going
pretty
far.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
--
we
get
back
to
this
too.
even
if
it
--
on
the
stand,
the
length
of
disability,
he
was
on
about
january
1930
to
about
july
of
1950,
some
six
odd
months.
now,
for
those
months
he
spent
in
the
various
marine
hospitals
at
no
cost
to
himself.
so,
if
there
was
no
liability,
get
his
maintenance
and
cure.
in
other
words,
for
the
two
months,
he
was
out-patient
received
a
few
hundred
dollars.
i
mean
that's
what
have
been
entitled.
this
was
a
liability
case.
so,
after
his
discussion
with
them,
he's
given
$3700
more
which
is
the
whole
spirit
of
negotiating
settlement
of
this
sort.
i
mean,
what
the
seaman
and
what
the
(inaudible)
do,
would
they
make
not
only
a
joint
approximation
of
future
disability
or
just
how
badly
hurt
the
fellow
is.
but
the
--
the
possibilities
of
winning
the
case,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
lawyer
in
this
court
room
that
hasn't
experienced
the
situation
where
he
was
99%
sure
he
is
going
to
win
a
case
and
just
something
that
he
couldn't
--
can't
explain
today,
laws
i
mean.
but
here,
there
was
certainly
adequacy
of
consideration.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i'm
sorry?
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
he
didn't
want
one.
he
wrote
--
he
wrote
letters
himself.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
union
lawyers
or
not.
i
presume
they
were
regular
seaman
employees,
went
to
the
marine
hospital.
i
mean,
they
go
there
to
see
their
own
patients
and
they
talk
to
the
seaman.
it
was
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
various
letters
here
at
the
back
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
i'm
not
going
to
accuse
them
of
abilisters
(inaudible),
that
sort
that
i
mean
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
they
were
trying
to
get
him
to
try
to
get
his
case,
yes.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
they
do.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
mean
to(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
not
giving
in,
no.
no.
that's
quite
to
answer,
your
honors
question
about
the
representations
made.
i
think
under
--
we
have
reached
the
point
today
with
the
advancement
in
union
organization,
the
facilities
they
seem
to
have.
the
ability
to
retain
counsel
that
--
that
just
as
the
garrett
case
says
that
the
determining
factor
in
the
establishment
of
the
release
is
valid
and
not
--
it's
not
--
it
is
the
nature
of
the
legal
and
--
and
medical
advice
available
to
him.
that's
--
that's
what
we
have
to
go
back.
that's
what
i
urge,
a
reiteration
of
that
principle.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
do
and
that
--
that's
a
question
that
i
wanted
to
answer
before,
that
there
has
been
a
or
a
lot
of
vagueness
in
resulting
to
hypothesis
when
talking
about
the
medical
aspects
of
this
case
and
the
mistakes
in
prognosis,
because
when
he
got
out
of
the
marine
hospital
before
signing
the
release.
he
was
given
a
slip
by
the
marine
hospital
and
what
could
be
more
independent
than
our
own
united
states
public
health
service.
that
he
had
this
fractured
skull
and
encephalopathy
which
is
a
brain
damage
due
to
trauma.
but
they
said
he'd
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
in
a
month.
nobody
denies
that
he
had
fractured
skull
that
he
knew
it
and
he
was
dealt
with
accordingly.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
adjusted
and
then
send
him
to
a
company
doctor
who
predicted
a
longer
disability
than
the
marine
hospital
that
is
three
months.
and
a
permanent
disability
which
the
marine
hospital
--
and
which
the
man
was
informed,
getting
back
to
representations,
he
is
told
this
by
the
adjustor.
and
then
the
man
goes
back
to
work
and
this
all
talks
in
petitioners
briefs
that
he
wasn't
able
to
sell
that
it's
high
ratings
as
he
could
before,
but
that's
contradicted
in
the
record
because
i've
put
in
the
records
in
the
grace
line
and
the
moore-mccormack
line
showing
that
he
could
work
or
two
years
later
as
chief
cook,
which
was
two
degrees
higher
than
he
had
worked
in
that
other
considerably
higher
wage
per
month.
in
the
time
that
elapsed
from
the
date
of
the
assault
and
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
to
the
marine
hospital,
he
did
go
back
to
the
marine
hospital
on
four
occasions
but
they
weren't
for
this
head
condition.
they
were
urethritis,
kidney
trouble,
ulcers
and
a
penile
sore
coming
that
fall
in
the
appendix
abstracts
from
these
various
marine
hospitals
with
the
exception,
that
a
week
before
the
trial,
his
attorney
sent
him
over
to
the
marine
hospital
and
he
took
two
out-patient
treatments
there.
and
that
--
that's
all
i
know,
just
asked
for
treatments.
and
there,
the
diagnosis
which
is
also
in
the
record
says,
"no
evidence
of
fracture
or
intracranial
pressure."
those
were
the
abstracts
of
the
last
visit
proceeding
the
trial.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes.
well,
they
--
they
take
--
they
take
those
--
no.
i
--
i
see
what
you
mean.
they
--
they
take
--
they
accept
--
they
take
those
findings
and
then
say
it's
fairly
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
one
--
one
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
the
--
the
only
actual
representation
here
as
i
quote
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
they
do
say
in
the
opinion
that
he
--
that
barron,
the
claim
agent,
said
he
had
a
weak
case.
but
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
it
was
upset
to
the
extent
that
the
circuit
court
consider
the
release
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
they
do
--
they
do
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
they
do
say
that.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
oh,
the
other
wasn't
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
the
other
was
a
fact
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
i
don't
think
he
--
actually,
according
to
the
record,
it
didn't
tell
he's
actually
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
--
10%
disability
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
that
is
judge
hartshorne
opinion
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
--
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
but
in
winding
up,
i
just
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
--
like
to
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
the
circuit
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
judge
hartshorne
said
they
had
a
weak
case
and
that
he
was
--
i
--
i
wish
i
had
the
--
the
actual
statement,
judge
hartshorne
(inaudible).
he
thought
he
was
more
disable
than
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
question
of
opinion.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
there
was
no
discussion
between
barron
and
thompson.
i
thought
the
keen
case
before
and
the
boudin
case
because
they
hadn't
been
decided
then,
but
just
--
they
talked
generally
about
the
solve
cases
and
how
long
you
have
to
wait
for
trial,
whether
or
not
he'd
win
the
case
and
they
discussed
amounts
beginning
with
$15,000
and
brought
it
down
to
the
--
for
the
(inaudible)
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
but
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
judge
hartshorne
mentioned
that
but
that
were
was
no
real
finding
of
how
they
were
incorrect
because
he
had
worked
--
he
had
worked
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
no,
because
they
took
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
that
--
that
was
an
answer
to
a
hypothetical
question
put
by
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
think
that's
incorrect
statement.
i'd
just
like
to
say
these
few
words
of
encouragement.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
my
petition
for
certiorari?
(voice
overlap)
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
you
read
from
the
circuit
court's
opinion
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i'm
sorry.
i
can't
just
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
--
spot
find
it.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
but
our
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
our
contention
throughout
here
is
for
release
such
as
this
is
set
aside,
the
only
way
that
those
sides
can
feel
that
a
seaman
or
at
least
as
effectively
board
is
to
insist
that
he
have
an
attorney,
insist
that
he
have
his
own
doctor
and
virtual
approval
of
a
--
of
a
court.
i
urge
this
court
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
well,
i
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
think
it
describes
the
whole
purpose
of
a
release.
a
release
as
a
joint
approximation
for
--
and
frequently
valid
and
most
--
most
of
the
time
it's
valid
between
two
lay
people,
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
it.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
case
that
the
release
that
followed
the
garrett
case
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
--
i
think
you
do,
your
honor,
and
the
--
the
opportunities
this
man
had,
the
independent
medical
advice
of
the
marine
hospital,
we
have
the
(inaudible)
the
fact
that
he
had
executed
releases
before.
he
knew
his
way
around.
he
knew
how
to
negotiate
a
settlement.
he
had
done
it
before
in
the
past.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
substantially,
yes.
particularly,
today
with
the
education
orientation
that
the
--
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
i
don't
think
that
was
ever
brought
out
in
the
record,
but
his
--
his
letters
themselves
integrate
of
--
a
fair
amount
of
literacy
(voice
overlap)
could
be
of
the
education,
the
claim
agent
had,
no.
mr.
michael
e.
hanrahan
put
thoughts
together
and
understand
what
was
wrong
with
him
--
what
he
had
to
accomplish.
