chief
justice
earl
warren
number
112,
amos
reece
versus
the
state
of
georgia.
i
understand
that
counsel
for
--
that
the
state
of
georgia
is
not
to
be
represented
here
today.
although,
they
have
been
notified
to
the
fact
and
--
and
notified
of
the
desirability
of
their
being
here.
so,
mr.
reece,
you
may
--
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
beg
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
duke.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duke
i
knew
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duke,
i
--
i
suppose
that
if
any
of
these
six
negro
people
were--
were
drawn
on
the
grand
jury
panel,
they
would
not
be
eligible
for
the
--
for
the
petit
jury,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
vice
versa?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
giving
me
the
procedure
by
which
they
--
they
draw
these
names,
please,
for
the
jury
--
grand
jury
panel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
in
both
boxes,
are
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
in
both
boxes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
may
i
--
may
i
just
interrupt
a
bit.
i
haven't
got
that
quite
clear
in
my
mind.how
many
members
on
your
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
23.
well,
are
the
first
23
names
pulled
out
in
this
box
to
become
the
grand
jurors
or
does
the
judge
retain
any
discretion
in
eliminating
this
or
that
for
his
own
reasons?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
i
wasn't
inferring
that
they
were,
but
under
the
--
under
the
louisiana
practices
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
i
understood
them,
they
drew
75,
and
then
the
judge
had
the
right
to
select
12
from
those
75.
i
wondered
if
you
have
any
such
practice.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
have
that
practice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
